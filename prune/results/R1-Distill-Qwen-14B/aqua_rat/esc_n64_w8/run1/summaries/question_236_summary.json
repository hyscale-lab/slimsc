      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about the cost of soda bottles. Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nThe question says that 27 bottles cost A cents. And I need to find out how much B bottles would cost in dollars. Hmm, right, so first, I should probably find out the cost per bottle, and then multiply that by B to get the total cost for B bottles. But wait, I also need to make sure the units are right because the final answer needs to be in dollars, not cents.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. If 27 bottles are A cents, then each bottle costs A divided by 27 cents. So the cost per bottle is A/27 cents. Now, for B bottles, the total cost in cents would be (A/27) * B. Let me write that as (A * B)/27 cents.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the cost in dollars, not cents. Since 1 dollar is 100 cents, I need to convert cents to dollars by dividing by 100. So, I take the total cost in cents, which is (A*B)/27, and divide that by 100. That gives me (A*B)/(27 * 100) dollars. Simplifying that, it's (A*B)/(2700) dollars.\n\nNow, I'll look at the options. Let's see:\n\nOption A is AB/2700. That matches what I just got. Option B is 27/AB, which seems like the reciprocal and probably wrong. Option C is AB/270, which is 10 times less than what I have. Because 2700 is 27*100, so 270 is 27*10. So if I have AB/2700, that's the same as (AB/27) divided by 100, which is the right approach. So C is AB/270, which is 10 times less than needed. So that's incorrect.\n\nOption D is 2700/AB, which would be the reciprocal of what we need. So that's not right. Option E is 100AB/27, which is way larger, so that can't be right either.\n\nWait, let me double-check. So 27 bottles cost A cents. So per bottle: A/27 cents. For B bottles: (A/27)*B cents. To dollars: (A*B)/(27*100) = AB/2700 dollars. Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be option A.\n",

I think I need to find the cost for B bottles, but the answer needs to be in dollars, not cents. So first, maybe I should find out the cost per bottle and then scale it up to B bottles.\n\nWait, right. So if 27 bottles cost A cents, then each bottle would cost A divided by 27 cents.

Wait, right, because the answer needs to be in dollars. So let me break it down.\n\nSo, 27 bottles cost A cents. That means each bottle costs A divided by 27 cents. So per bottle, it's A/27 cents. Right, because if you have 27 bottles, each one is a fraction of the total cost.\n\nNow, if I have B bottles, then the total cost in cents would be the price per bottle multiplied by B. So that's (A/27) * B cents. Let me write that as (AB)/27 cents. \n\nBut wait, the question asks for the cost in dollars. Oh right, because 1 dollar is 100 cents. So I need to convert cents to dollars. To do that, I divide by 100. So the total cost in dollars would be (AB/27) / 100. \n\nHmm, let me make sure I did that right. So (AB) divided by 27 gives me the cost in cents, and then I divide by 100 to convert to dollars. So that's AB/(27*100) which is AB/2700 dollars. \n\nLooking at the options, option A is AB/2700, which matches what I got. Let me check the other options just to be sure.\n\nOption B is 27/AB. That doesn't seem right. If I increase B, the cost should go up, but this would make it smaller. So B is probably not the right answer.\n\nOption C is AB/270. Wait, that's similar to what I have, but missing a division by 10. Oh because 2700 is 27*100, so AB/2700 is correct. So C would be if I divided by 270 instead, which is 27*10, so that's incorrect.\n\nOption D is 2700/AB. Hmm, that's the reciprocal. So if A and B are both 27, then it would give 2700/27 = 100, which would be 100 dollars. But wait, if A is 27 cents for 27 bottles, then each bottle is 1 cent, so B=27 would be 27 cents. Which is 0.27 dollars. But option D would give 100, which is way off. So D is not right.\n\nOption E is 100AB/27. That's like taking (AB/27)*100, which would be cents multiplied by 100, which would give dollars per bottle or something else. Wait, no, that would actually give me dollars if I multiplied by 100. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Wait, if each bottle is A/27 cents, then B bottles would be (AB)/27 cents. To convert to dollars, I divide by 100, so (AB)/(27*100) = AB/2700. So E is 100AB/27, which is (AB/27)*100. Wait, that would be converting from cents to dollars incorrectly. Because 100 cents is a dollar, so to get dollars you divide by 100, not multiply.

Hmm, the question says that 27 bottles cost A cents, and we need to find out how much B bottles would cost in dollars. \n\nAlright, first, I think I should find out the cost per bottle. If 27 bottles cost A cents, then one bottle would cost A divided by 27 cents. So, per bottle is A/27 cents. Got that part.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for B bottles. So I guess I multiply the cost per bottle by B. That would be (A/27) * B cents. Let me write that down: (A * B) / 27 cents. \n\nBut wait, the answer needs to be in dollars, right? Because the options are in dollars. Oh right, because 1 dollar is 100 cents. So I need to convert cents to dollars. To do that, I can divide the total cents by 100. \n\nSo, the total cost in dollars would be [(A * B) / 27] divided by 100. Which is the same as (A * B) / (27 * 100) dollars. Let me calculate that denominator: 27 times 100 is 2700. So the total cost is (A * B) / 2700 dollars.\n\nNow, looking at the options, I need to match this expression. Let's see the options:\n\nOption A: AB/2700. That looks exactly like what I have. So that's (A*B)/(27*100) which is the same as (A*B)/2700. \n\nOption B is 27/(AB), which doesn't make sense because it's a division of 27 by AB, not AB over 27. \n\nOption C is AB/270. Hmm, 270 is 27*10, so that would be if we only divided by 10, which is incorrect since we need to divide by 100 to get dollars.\n\nOption D is 2700/AB, which is the reciprocal of what we have. That would be wrong because if AB is larger, the cost should be higher, but this would give a smaller number. \n\nOption E is 100AB/27, which is way bigger. That can't be right because that's not converting cents to dollars. \n\nSo the correct formula is (AB)/2700, which is option A. \n\nWait, let me double-check. Suppose A is 27 and B is 100. Then 27 bottles cost A=27 cents. So 1 bottle is 1 cent. Then B=100 bottles would cost 100 cents, which is $1. \n\nPlugging into option A: (27*100)/2700 = 2700/2700 = 1. Correct. \n\nAnother test: if A is 54 cents for 27 bottles, that's 2 cents per bottle. So B=54 would be 54 *2 = 108 cents = $1.08. \n\nUsing option A: (54 *54)/2700. Let me calculate that: 54*54 is 2916. Divided by 2700 is 1.08. Yep, that's correct. \n\nSo yeah, option A is the right choice.\n",

If 27 bottles cost A cents, then one bottle would cost A divided by 27 cents. So, per bottle is A/27 cents. Got that part.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for B bottles. So I guess I multiply the cost per bottle by B. That would be (A/27) * B cents. Let me write that down: (A * B) / 27 cents. \n\nBut wait, the answer needs to be in dollars, right? Because the options are in dollars. Oh right, because 1 dollar is 100 cents. So I need to convert cents to dollars. To do that, I can divide the total cents by 100. \n\nSo, the total cost in dollars would be [(A * B) / 27] divided by 100. Which is the same as (A * B) / (27 * 100) dollars. Let me calculate that denominator: 27 times 100 is 2700. So the total cost is (A * B) / 2700 dollars.\n\nNow, looking at the options, I need to match this expression. Let's see the options:\n\nOption A: AB/2700. That looks exactly like what I have. So that's (A*B)/(27*100) which is the same as (A*B)/2700. \n\nOption B is 27/(AB), which doesn't make sense because it's a division of 27 by AB, not AB over 27. \n\nOption C is AB/270. Hmm, 270 is 27*10, so that would be if we only divided by 10, which is incorrect since we need to divide by 100 to get dollars.\n\nOption D is 2700/AB, which is the reciprocal of what we have. That would be wrong because if AB is larger, the cost should be higher, but this would give a smaller number. \n\nOption E is 100AB/27, which is way bigger. That can't be right because that's not converting cents to dollars. \n\nSo the correct formula is (AB)/2700, which is option A. \n\nWait, let me double-check. Suppose A is 27 and B is 100. Then 27 bottles cost A=27 cents. So 1 bottle is 1 cent. Then B=100 bottles would cost 100 cents, which is $1. \n\nPlugging into option A: (27*100)/2700 = 2700/2700 = 1. Correct. \n\nAnother test: if A is 54 cents for 27 bottles, that's 2 cents per bottle. So B=54 would be 54 *2 = 108 cents = $1.08. \n\nUsing option A: (54 *54)/2700. Let me calculate that: 54*54 is 2916. Divided by 2700 is 1.08. Yep, that's correct. \n\nSo yeah, option A is the right choice.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by determining the cost per bottle. Since 27 bottles cost A cents, the cost per bottle is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A}{27} \\text{ cents per bottle}.\n\\]\n\nFor B bottles, the total cost in cents is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A \\cdot B}{27} \\text{ cents}.\n\\]\n\nTo convert this to dollars, we divide by 100 (since 1 dollar = 100 cents):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A \\cdot B}{27 \\cdot 100} = \\frac{A \\cdot B}{2700} \\text{ dollars}.\n\\]\n\nNow, we compare this result with the given options:\n\n- **Option A:** \\( \\frac{AB}{2700} \\) matches the derived expression.\n- **Option B:** \\( \\frac{27}{AB} \\) is incorrect because it is the reciprocal of the correct expression.\n- **Option C:** \\( \\frac{AB}{270} \\) is incorrect because it only divides by 10 instead of 100.\n- **Option D:** \\( \\frac{2700}{AB} \\) is incorrect because it is the reciprocal of the correct expression.\n- **Option E:** \\( \\frac{100AB}{27} \\) is incorrect because it does not properly convert cents to dollars.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: A**",

First, I know that if 27 bottles cost A cents, then each bottle must cost A divided by 27 cents. So the cost per bottle is A/27 cents. That makes sense because if you have more bottles, each one would cost less. So for one bottle, you divide the total cost by the number of bottles.\n\nWait, but wait, the question is about B bottles. So I need to find the cost for B bottles. So that would be (A/27) * B cents, right? Because each bottle is A/27 cents, so B times that gives the total cost in cents.\n\nSo the cost in cents is (A * B) / 27. But wait, the answer needs to be in dollars, not cents. Oh, right, because 1 dollar is 100 cents. So I need to convert cents to dollars.\n\nTo convert cents to dollars, I divide by 100. Because 100 cents equal a dollar. So the total cost in dollars would be [(A * B)/27] divided by 100. Alternatively, that's the same as (A * B) / (27 * 100), which simplifies to (A * B) / 2700.\n\nSo putting that together, the formula is (AB) / 2700 dollars. Let me look at the options.\n\nOption A is AB/2700, which matches what I got. So that should be the correct answer. Let me double-check the other options to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nOption B: 27/AB. That doesn't seem right because if B increases, the cost should increase, but this option would decrease. So B can't be correct.\n\nOption C: AB/270. Hmm, that's similar but the denominator is 270, which is 27*10. Wait, wait, because I have to go from cents to dollars, which is dividing by 100. So 270 is 27*10, but that's not the right conversion. So this can't be the right answer.\n\nOption D: 2700/AB. That's the reciprocal of what I have. If AB increases, this would decrease, which is opposite of what we want. So D is incorrect.\n\nOption E: 100AB/27. That would be the case if we didn't convert to dollars, but instead multiplied by 100. Wait, no. Wait, if each bottle is A/27 cents, then B bottles would be AB/27 cents. To get dollars, we divide by 100, so AB/(27*100) = AB/2700. So E is 100AB/27, which would be incorrect because that's not considering the division by 100. So E is wrong.\n\nSo yeah, the correct answer must be option A: AB/2700.\n",
