      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about two ants moving towards each other. Hmm, let me read it again. Ant A is moving at 9 cm per hour, and ant B at 6 cm per hour. Their farms are 75 cm apart. I need to find how far ant A travels before they meet.\n\nWait, I think I remember that when two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. So the combined speed here would be 9 + 6, which is 15 cm per hour. That makes sense because they're approaching each other, so the distance between them decreases at that combined rate.\n\nNow, the total distance between their farms is 75 cm. So the time it takes for them to meet should be the total distance divided by their combined speed. Let me calculate that. Time equals distance over speed, so 75 divided by 15. Oh, that's 5 hours. Wait, 15 times 5 is 75, right. So yes, 5 hours until they meet.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking how far ant A travels. Ant A's speed is 9 cm per hour, so in 5 hours, it would have traveled 9 * 5. Let me do that math. 9 times 5 is 45. So ant A travels 45 cm before meeting ant B.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 45. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Another way to think about it: the ratio of their speeds is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. So the distance each ant covers should be in the same ratio. The total distance is 75 cm, so the parts would be 3 parts and 2 parts. 3+2 is 5 parts. Each part is 75/5 =15 cm. So ant A, which has 3 parts, would have 3*15=45 cm. Yep, same answer.

So that's the correct choice.\n\n\nThe two ants are moving towards each other, with Ant A traveling at 9 cm/h and Ant B at 6 cm/h. The total distance between their farms is 75 cm. Since they are moving towards each other, their combined speed is \\( 9 + 6 = 15 \\, \\text{cm/h} \\). The time until they meet can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{75}{15} = 5 \\, \\text{hours}.\n\\]\n\nThe distance Ant A travels in this time is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = 9 \\times 5 = 45 \\, \\text{cm}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the distance Ant A travels until meeting Ant B is **45 cm**.\n\nAnswer: A",

Oh, wait, no, that's correct because they're moving towards each other. So the time it takes for them to meet should be the total distance divided by their combined speed.\n\nThe total distance between their farms is 75 cm.

The distance they cover is speed multiplied by time. So the time until they meet is the total distance divided by their combined speed. So yes, 75 cm divided by (9+6) cm/h is 75/15 = 5 hours.
