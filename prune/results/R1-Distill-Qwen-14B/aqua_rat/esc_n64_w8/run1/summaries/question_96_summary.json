      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I have this problem here about friends going on a picnic and some money calculations. Hmm. So, the problem is: A number of friends planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. But four of them didn't turn up. Because of that, the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each. I need to find out how many attended the picnic.\n\nWait, so let me break it down. Let's say the total number of friends initially was N. They were supposed to split the Rs. 96 equally, right? So each was going to pay 96/N rupees.\n\nBut then four didn't come. So the number who attended is N-4. Now, the cost per person increased by Rs. 4. So each now has to pay (96/(N-4)) rupees. And this amount is Rs. 4 more than what they originally planned.\n\nSo the equation should be: (96/(N-4)) = (96/N) + 4.\n\nHmm, that makes sense. Now I need to solve this equation for N.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n96/(N-4) = (96/N) + 4.\n\nI can rearrange this. Let's subtract 96/N from both sides:\n\n96/(N-4) - 96/N = 4.\n\nTo combine the left side, I'll find a common denominator, which is N*(N-4). So,\n\n[96*N - 96*(N-4)] / [N*(N-4)] = 4.\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n96N -96N + 384 = 384.\n\nSo, numerator is 384. So equation becomes:\n\n384 / [N*(N-4)] = 4.\n\nMultiply both sides by N*(N-4):\n\n384 = 4 * N*(N-4).\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n96 = N*(N-4).\n\nSo now I have a quadratic equation:\n\nN\u00b2 -4N -96 = 0.\n\nLet me try to factor this. Hmm. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -96 and add to -4. Let's see. 12 and -8: 12 * (-8) = -96, and 12 + (-8) =4. Oh wait, but the equation is N\u00b2 -4N -96. So the factors would be (N - 12)(N + 8) = 0. Because 12 * (-8) is -96 and 12 + (-8) is 4. Wait, but the middle term is -4N. Let me check: (N - 12)(N +8) = N\u00b2 +8N -12N -96 = N\u00b2-4N-96. Yes, correct.\n\nSo the solutions are N=12 or N=-8. Since the number of people can't be negative, N=12.\n\nWait, but wait. The question is asking for the number of those who attended, which is N-4. Because N is the original number, and four didn't come.\n\nSo N=12, so attendees are 12-4=8. So the answer should be 8, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If originally 12 were supposed to come, each would pay 96/12=8. Then 4 didn't come, so 8 people. Each now pays 96/8=12. Which is 4 more than 8. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the number of attendees is 8, which is option A.\n",

Let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nSo the original plan was for a certain number of friends to go, and they were planning to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. But then, four of them didn't show up. Because of that, the remaining friends had to each pay Rs.4 extra. The question is asking how many attended the picnic.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. I think I should set up some variables. Let's say the original number of friends was N. So they were each supposed to contribute an equal amount. The total was Rs.96, so each person's share would be 96 divided by N. So the original share per person is 96/N.\n\nBut then four didn't come. So the number of attendees is N -4. Now, because of these four not coming, the remaining people had to pay Rs.4 more each. So each person's new share is (96/N) +4.\n\nWait, but wait, another way to look at it is that the total amount is still 96, but now it's being split among fewer people. So the new share per person is 96 divided by (N-4). And according to the problem, this new share is Rs.4 more than the original share.\n\nSo putting that into an equation: (96)/(N-4) = (96/N) +4.\n\nHmm, that seems right. Now I need to solve this equation for N.\n\nLet me write that equation again:\n\n96/(N-4) = (96/N) +4.\n\nTo solve for N, I can first subtract (96/N) from both sides to get:\n\n96/(N-4) - 96/N =4.\n\nFactor out the 96:\n\n96 [ 1/(N-4) - 1/N ] =4.\n\nLet me compute the part inside the brackets. 1/(N-4) -1/N is equal to [N - (N-4)] / [N(N-4)].\n\nSimplify numerator: N - (N-4) =4. So it's 4 / [N(N-4)].\n\nSo now the equation becomes:\n\n96 * (4) / [N(N-4)] =4.\n\nWait, 96 *4 is 384, so:\n\n384 / [N(N-4)] =4.\n\nMultiply both sides by N(N-4):\n\n384 =4 * N(N-4).\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n96 = N(N-4).\n\nSo N squared minus 4N equals 96.\n\nBring 96 to left: N\u00b2 -4N -96=0.\n\nNow, solving this quadratic equation.

So maybe 12 and -8? Let me check:\n\n(N-12)(N+8) = N\u00b2 -12N +8N -96 = N\u00b2 -4N -96. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the factors are (N-12)(N+8) =0. So N=12 or N=-8. Since the number of people can't be negative, N=12.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the number of those who attended the picnic, which is N-4. So if N was 12, then the attendees were 12-4=8.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 8. So the answer should be A.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nOriginal plan: 12 people, each paying 96/12=8 Rs.\n\nBut four didn't come, so 8 people. Now each pays 96/8=12 Rs.\n\n12 Rs is indeed 4 Rs more than 8. So yes, that checks out.\n\nSo the number of attendees is 8, which is option A.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about friends going on a picnic and some money calculations. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says a group of friends planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. But four of them didn't show up. Because of that, the ones who did attend had to pay Rs. 4 extra each. We need to find out how many attended the picnic.\n\nWait, so originally, they all were going to split the Rs. 96. But when four didn't come, the number of people paying became fewer, so each person had to pay more. Oh right, because the total cost doesn't change, but the per-person share does.\n\nLet me think about variables. Let's say the number of friends who attended is x. Then, originally, there were x +4 friends because four didn't come. Because if x is the number who attended, then x +4 were supposed to come, right?\n\nWait, wait. Let me clarify. Let's denote the original number of friends as N. So N was the total planning to go, but four didn't, so attendees were N-4. Wait, no, maybe I should think differently. Let me try setting it up with equations.\n\nLet me let the number of people who attended be x. So the original number of people planning was x +4, because four didn't come. So originally, each person was supposed to pay 96 divided by (x+4) rupees. But since four didn't come, now each has to pay 96 divided by x rupees. And the difference between these two is Rs.4.\n\nSo the equation would be: (96 / x) - (96 / (x +4)) = 4.\n\nHmm, that makes sense. So let me write that down:\n\n96/x - 96/(x+4) = 4.\n\nNow I need to solve for x. Let me try to manipulate this equation.\n\nFirst, I'll find a common denominator for the fractions on the left side. The common denominator is x(x+4). So:\n\n[96(x+4) - 96x] / [x(x+4)] = 4.\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n96x + 384 -96x = 384.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n384 / [x(x+4)] = 4.\n\nMultiply both sides by x(x+4):\n\n384 = 4x(x+4).\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n96 = x(x+4).\n\nSo now the equation is:\n\nx\u00b2 +4x -96 =0.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check:\n\nx squared plus 4x minus 96 equals zero. To solve this quadratic equation, I can use the quadratic formula.\n\nThe quadratic equation is ax\u00b2 +bx +c =0. So here, a=1, b=4, c=-96.\n\nThe formula is x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)] / (2a).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nDiscriminant D = 4\u00b2 -4*1*(-96) = 16 + 384 = 400.\n\nSquare root of 400 is 20.\n\nSo x = [-4 \u00b120]/2.\n\nWe have two solutions:\n\nx = (-4 +20)/2 = 16/2=8.\n\nx = (-4 -20)/2 = -24/2= -12.\n\nBut since the number of people can't be negative, x=8.\n\nSo the number of attendees is 8. Let me check the options. Option A is 8.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about friends going on a picnic and some money calculations. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says a group of friends planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. But four of them didn't show up. Because of that, the ones who did attend had to pay Rs. 4 extra each. We need to find out how many attended the picnic.\n\nWait, so originally, they all were going to split the Rs. 96. But when four didn't come, the number of people paying became fewer, so each person had to pay more. Oh right, because the total cost doesn't change, but the per-person share does.\n\nLet me think about variables. Let's say the number of friends who attended is x. Then, originally, there were x +4 friends because four didn't come. Because if x is the number who attended, then x +4 were supposed to come, right?\n\nWait, wait. Let me clarify. Let's denote the original number of friends as N. So N was the total planning to go, but four didn't, so attendees were N-4. Wait, no, maybe I should think differently. Let me try setting it up with equations.\n\nLet me let the number of people who attended be x. So the original number of people planning was x +4, because four didn't come. So originally, each person was supposed to pay 96 divided by (x+4) rupees. But since four didn't come, now each has to pay 96 divided by x rupees. And the difference between these two is Rs.4.\n\nSo the equation would be: (96 / x) - (96 / (x +4)) = 4.\n\nHmm, that makes sense. So let me write that down:\n\n96/x - 96/(x+4) = 4.\n\nNow I need to solve for x. Let me try to manipulate this equation.\n\nFirst, I'll find a common denominator for the fractions on the left side. The common denominator is x(x+4). So:\n\n[96(x+4) - 96x] / [x(x+4)] = 4.\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n96x + 384 -96x = 384.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n384 / [x(x+4)] = 4.\n\nMultiply both sides by x(x+4):\n\n384 = 4x(x+4).\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n96 = x(x+4).\n\nSo now the equation is:\n\nx\u00b2 +4x -96 =0.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check:\n\nx squared plus 4x minus 96 equals zero. To solve this quadratic equation, I can use the quadratic formula.\n\nThe quadratic equation is ax\u00b2 +bx +c =0. So here, a=1, b=4, c=-96.\n\nThe formula is x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)] / (2a).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nDiscriminant D = 4\u00b2 -4*1*(-96) = 16 + 384 = 400.\n\nSquare root of 400 is 20.\n\nSo x = [-4 \u00b120]/2.\n\nWe have two solutions:\n\nx = (-4 +20)/2 = 16/2=8.\n\nx = (-4 -20)/2 = -24/2= -12.\n\nBut since the number of people can't be negative, x=8.\n\nSo the number of attendees is 8. Let me check the options. Option A is 8.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on these types of problems, but let's think it through.\n\nAlright, so originally, the total amount they planned to spend was Rs. 96. They were expecting a certain number of friends, let's call that number 'x'. So each person was supposed to contribute 96 divided by x, right? So each would pay 96/x rupees.\n\nBut then, four of them didn't turn up. So the number of people who actually went is x minus 4. Because four less than the original number. Now, because fewer people are there, each of the remaining has to pay more. The problem says each had to contribute Rs. 4 extra. So the new amount each person has to pay is (96/x) + 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, maybe I should set up an equation. Because when four people are missing, the total amount that the remaining have to cover is still Rs. 96, right? So the new contribution per person is 96 divided by (x-4). And this new amount is Rs. 4 more than the original contribution per person.\n\nSo the original contribution per person is 96/x, and the new one is 96/(x-4). And the new one is equal to the original plus 4. So the equation should be:\n\n96/(x-4) = (96/x) + 4\n\nHmm, okay, let me write that down:\n\n96/(x-4) = 96/x + 4\n\nI think that's the correct equation. Now, I need to solve for x. Let's rearrange this equation.\n\nFirst, subtract 96/x from both sides:\n\n96/(x-4) - 96/x = 4\n\nI can factor 96 out:\n\n96 [ 1/(x-4) - 1/x ] =4\n\nLet's compute the terms inside the brackets. 1/(x-4) minus 1/x is equal to [x - (x-4)] divided by [x(x-4)]. Wait, that's right:\n\n1/(x-4) - 1/x = [x - (x-4)] / [x(x-4)] = [x -x +4]/[x(x-4)] = 4/[x(x-4)]\n\nSo substituting back into the equation:\n\n96 * [4/(x(x-4))] =4\n\nSo, 96 * 4 / [x(x-4)] =4\n\nMultiply both sides by [x(x-4)]:\n\n96*4 =4 * x(x-4)\n\nSimplify 96*4 is 384, and 4 * x(x-4) is 4x(x-4). So:\n\n384 =4x(x-4)\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n96 =x(x-4)\n\nSo now, the equation is x^2 -4x -96 =0\n\nWait, let me compute that. Expanding x(x-4) is x\u00b2 -4x, so equation is x\u00b2 -4x -96 =0.\n\nNow, solving this quadratic equation. Let me try to factor it. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -96 and add to -4.\n\nHmm, factors of 96: 12 and 8. 12*8=96. So maybe 12 and -8? 12 -8=4, but we need -4. So maybe  -12 and +8: -12 +8= -4. Yes, that works.\n\nSo, the equation factors as (x-12)(x+8) =0.\n\nSo, the solutions are x=12 or x=-8. Since the number of people can't be negative, x must be 12.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the number of those who attended the picnic. So the original number was 12, but four didn't come. So the number who attended is 12-4=8.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes I get confused whether x is the original number or the number that attended.\n\nWait, no, x was the original number of friends. So the number that attended is x-4=12-4=8. So the correct answer should be 8, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. Let me plug x=12 back into the original equation.\n\nOriginal contribution per person: 96/12=8 Rs.\n\nWhen four don't come, number of attendees is 8.

Because of this, the remaining friends had to each contribute Rs. 4 extra. The question is asking how many people attended the picnic. The options are A)8, B)12, C)16, D)24, E)25.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. So initially, they thought a certain number of people would come, but four didn't. Let's say the original number of friends was N. But four didn't come, so the number who attended is N-4.\n\nThe total cost was Rs. 96. So, originally, each person was supposed to contribute 96 divided by N. But when four didn't come, each of the remaining had to pay more. Each ended up paying Rs.4 extra.\n\nWait, so the original contribution per person was 96/N. After four didn't come, the number of people became N-4, so each had to pay 96/(N-4). And this new amount is Rs.4 more than the original.\n\nSo, mathematically, 96/(N-4) = (96/N) +4. That's the equation I need to solve.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n96/(N-4) = (96/N) +4.\n\nI can rearrange this equation to solve for N.

So,\n\n384 / [N(N-4)] =4.\n\nMultiply both sides by N(N-4):\n\n384 =4*N(N-4).\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n96 = N(N-4).\n\nSo now, the equation is N^2 -4N -96 =0.\n\nI can solve this quadratic equation.

If I have 12 and -8, their product is -96, and sum is 4. Oh wait, but in the equation, the sum is -4. So maybe -12 and +8. Because (-12) +8 = -4, and (-12)*8 = -96. So yes, that works.\n\nSo the equation factors to (N-12)(N+8)=0.\n\nSo, N=12 or N=-8. Since N can't be negative, N=12.\n\nWait, but N is the original number of friends. So the number that attended is N-4 =12-4=8. So the answer is 8 people attended. Looking at the options, option A is 8.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me plug N=12 back into the original setup. Original plan: 12 people, each paying 96/12=8 Rs. But four didn't come, so 8 people attended. Now, each pays 96/8=12 Rs. So the extra per person is 12-8=4 Rs. Which matches the problem statement. So yes, it's correct.\n\nSo the number of attendees is 8. The correct option is A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says that a group of friends planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables for their picnic. But four of them didn't show up. Because of this, the remaining friends had to each contribute Rs. 4 extra. The question is asking how many people attended the picnic. The options are A)8, B)12, C)16, D)24, E)25.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. So initially, they thought a certain number of people would come, but four didn't. Let's say the original number of friends was N. But four didn't come, so the number who attended is N-4.\n\nThe total cost was Rs. 96. So, originally, each person was supposed to contribute 96 divided by N. But when four didn't come, each of the remaining had to pay more. Each ended up paying Rs.4 extra.\n\nWait, so the original contribution per person was 96/N. After four didn't come, the number of people became N-4, so each had to pay 96/(N-4). And this new amount is Rs.4 more than the original.\n\nSo, mathematically, 96/(N-4) = (96/N) +4. That's the equation I need to solve.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n96/(N-4) = (96/N) +4.\n\nI can rearrange this equation to solve for N. Let's subtract 96/N from both sides:\n\n96/(N-4) - 96/N = 4.\n\nHmm, maybe I can combine the fractions. Let's find a common denominator, which would be N(N-4).\n\nSo, [96*N -96*(N-4)] / [N(N-4)] =4.\n\nSimplify the numerator: 96N -96N + 384 = 384. So,\n\n384 / [N(N-4)] =4.\n\nMultiply both sides by N(N-4):\n\n384 =4*N(N-4).\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n96 = N(N-4).\n\nSo now, the equation is N^2 -4N -96 =0.\n\nI can solve this quadratic equation. Let's try factoring it.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -96 and add to -4. Hmm. Let's see factors of 96: 12 and 8, 16 and 6, 24 and 4.\n\nWait, 12 and 8. If I have 12 and -8, their product is -96, and sum is 4. Oh wait, but in the equation, the sum is -4. So maybe -12 and +8. Because (-12) +8 = -4, and (-12)*8 = -96. So yes, that works.\n\nSo the equation factors to (N-12)(N+8)=0.\n\nSo, N=12 or N=-8. Since N can't be negative, N=12.\n\nWait, but N is the original number of friends. So the number that attended is N-4 =12-4=8. So the answer is 8 people attended.

So yes, it's correct.\n\nSo the number of attendees is 8. The correct option is A.\n\n\nThe problem involves a group of friends planning to spend Rs. 96 on eatables, but four of them did not attend, causing each of the remaining friends to contribute Rs. 4 extra.

Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nThe total amount they planned to spend is Rs. 96. Originally, a certain number of friends were going to split this cost. But then four of them didn't come, so the remaining friends each had to pay Rs. 4 more than they originally would have. I need to find out how many attended the picnic.\n\nHmm, let's think about variables. Let's say the original number of friends was 'x'. So each was supposed to pay 96 divided by x, which is 96/x. But since four didn't come, the number of attendees became x-4. Now each of these has to pay 4 rupees more. So the new amount each pays is (96/(x-4)).\n\nWait, no, wait. The new amount each has to pay is (96/x + 4), because they're paying Rs.4 extra each. Or wait, maybe I should set it up as an equation where the new per-person cost is (96/(x-4)) which equals the original per-person cost plus 4.\n\nSo, the original per-person cost is 96/x. After four friends didn't come, each person pays 96/(x-4). And this new amount is 4 rupees more than before. So, the equation would be:\n\n96/(x-4) = (96/x) + 4\n\nHmm, that makes sense. Let me write that down:\n\n96/(x-4) = (96/x) + 4\n\nNow I need to solve for x. Let's rearrange this equation. First, maybe subtract 96/x from both sides to get:\n\n96/(x-4) - 96/x = 4\n\nFactor 96 out:\n\n96 [1/(x-4) - 1/x] =4\n\nSimplify inside the brackets.

But since the number of friends can't be negative, x=12.\n\nSo the original number of friends was 12.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.\n\nAlright, the problem says that a group of friends planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables for their picnic. But then, four of them didn't show up. Because of that, the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each. The question is asking how many of them actually attended the picnic. The options are A)8, B)12, C)16, D)24, E)25.\n\nHmm. So, let me try to understand this. The original plan was for all the friends to split the Rs. 96. But since four didn't come, the remaining had to pay more. Each of them paid Rs. 4 more than they were supposed to.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Maybe using variables would help. Let's say the original number of friends was N. So, each was supposed to pay 96 divided by N, right? So, the cost per person originally would be 96/N.\n\nBut then, four didn't come, so the number of people who attended is N - 4. Now, each of them had to pay Rs. 4 more. So, the new cost per person is (96/(N-4)). \n\nWait, but the problem says each had to contribute Rs. 4 extra. So, the new amount each pays is the original amount plus 4. So, (96/N) + 4 = 96/(N-4). That makes sense because each person is now contributing 4 more than before.\n\nSo, I can set up the equation: \n\n(96/N) + 4 = 96/(N-4)\n\nNow, I need to solve for N. Let's rearrange this equation.\n\nFirst, subtract (96/N) from both sides:\n\n4 = 96/(N-4) - 96/N\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated. Let me compute the right side. Let's find a common denominator for the two fractions. The common denominator would be N(N-4). So:\n\n96/(N-4) = (96N)/(N(N-4))\n96/N = (96(N-4))/(N(N-4))\n\nSo, subtracting them:\n\n96/(N-4) - 96/N = [96N - 96(N-4)] / [N(N-4)]\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n96N - 96(N-4) = 96N -96N + 384 = 384.\n\nSo, the right side becomes 384/(N(N-4)).\n\nSo, our equation now is:\n\n4 = 384/(N(N-4))\n\nMultiply both sides by N(N-4) to eliminate the denominator:\n\n4 * N(N-4) = 384\n\nLet's compute the left side:\n\n4N(N-4) = 384\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\nN(N-4) = 96\n\nSo, expanding that:\n\nN\u00b2 -4N = 96\n\nBring 96 to the left:\n\nN\u00b2 -4N -96 =0\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation: N\u00b2 -4N -96 =0\n\nI can try to solve this quadratic equation. Let's see if it factors. The product of the roots should be -96, and the sum is 4.\n\nHmm, factors of 96 are 1&96, 2&48, 3&32, 4&24, 6&16, 8&12.\n\nLooking for two numbers that differ by 4 (since the middle term is -4N). Wait, because the equation is N\u00b2 -4N -96, so the factors would be (N - a)(N + b) =0, where a and b are positive, and a*b=96, a - b =4.\n\nLooking for two numbers a and b such that a*b=96 and a -b=4.\n\nLet's try 12 and 8. 12*8=96, but 12-8=4. Perfect.\n\nSo, the equation factors as (N -12)(N +8) =0.\n\nSo, the solutions are N=12 or N= -8. Since the number of people can't be negative, N=12 is the solution.\n\nWait, so the original number of friends was 12. But four didn't come, so the number who attended was 12-4=8.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check this because I might have made a mistake.\n\nSo, if N=12, each was supposed to pay 96/12 = 8 Rs. But four didn't come, so 8 people attended. Each now has to pay 96/8 = 12 Rs. So, each contributes 4 Rs more (12-8=4). That matches the problem statement. So, the number who attended is 8.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 8. So, the answer should be A.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. The question is asking for the number of those who attended, which is N-4. Since N=12, then 12-4=8. So, correct.\n\nBut wait, wait, the options include 8 as A and 24 as D. Did I make a mistake in the quadratic?

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.\n\nAlright, the problem says that a group of friends planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables for their picnic. But then, four of them didn't show up. Because of that, the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each. The question is asking how many of them actually attended the picnic. The options are A)8, B)12, C)16, D)24, E)25.\n\nHmm. So, let me try to understand this. The original plan was for all the friends to split the Rs. 96. But since four didn't come, the remaining had to pay more. Each of them paid Rs. 4 more than they were supposed to.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Maybe using variables would help. Let's say the original number of friends was N. So, each was supposed to pay 96 divided by N, right? So, the cost per person originally would be 96/N.\n\nBut then, four didn't come, so the number of people who attended is N - 4. Now, each of them had to pay Rs. 4 more. So, the new cost per person is (96/(N-4)). \n\nWait, but the problem says each had to contribute Rs. 4 extra. So, the new amount each pays is the original amount plus 4. So, (96/N) + 4 = 96/(N-4). That makes sense because each person is now contributing 4 more than before.\n\nSo, I can set up the equation: \n\n(96/N) + 4 = 96/(N-4)\n\nNow, I need to solve for N. Let's rearrange this equation.\n\nFirst, subtract (96/N) from both sides:\n\n4 = 96/(N-4) - 96/N\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated. Let me compute the right side. Let's find a common denominator for the two fractions. The common denominator would be N(N-4). So:\n\n96/(N-4) = (96N)/(N(N-4))\n96/N = (96(N-4))/(N(N-4))\n\nSo, subtracting them:\n\n96/(N-4) - 96/N = [96N - 96(N-4)] / [N(N-4)]\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n96N - 96(N-4) = 96N -96N + 384 = 384.\n\nSo, the right side becomes 384/(N(N-4)).\n\nSo, our equation now is:\n\n4 = 384/(N(N-4))\n\nMultiply both sides by N(N-4) to eliminate the denominator:\n\n4 * N(N-4) = 384\n\nLet's compute the left side:\n\n4N(N-4) = 384\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\nN(N-4) = 96\n\nSo, expanding that:\n\nN\u00b2 -4N = 96\n\nBring 96 to the left:\n\nN\u00b2 -4N -96 =0\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation: N\u00b2 -4N -96 =0\n\nI can try to solve this quadratic equation. Let's see if it factors. The product of the roots should be -96, and the sum is 4.\n\nHmm, factors of 96 are 1&96, 2&48, 3&32, 4&24, 6&16, 8&12.\n\nLooking for two numbers that differ by 4 (since the middle term is -4N). Wait, because the equation is N\u00b2 -4N -96, so the factors would be (N - a)(N + b) =0, where a and b are positive, and a*b=96, a - b =4.\n\nLooking for two numbers a and b such that a*b=96 and a -b=4.\n\nLet's try 12 and 8. 12*8=96, but 12-8=4. Perfect.\n\nSo, the equation factors as (N -12)(N +8) =0.\n\nSo, the solutions are N=12 or N= -8. Since the number of people can't be negative, N=12 is the solution.\n\nWait, so the original number of friends was 12. But four didn't come, so the number who attended was 12-4=8.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check this because I might have made a mistake.\n\nSo, if N=12, each was supposed to pay 96/12 = 8 Rs. But four didn't come, so 8 people attended. Each now has to pay 96/8 = 12 Rs. So, each contributes 4 Rs more (12-8=4). That matches the problem statement. So, the number who attended is 8.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 8. So, the answer should be A.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. The question is asking for the number of those who attended, which is N-4. Since N=12, then 12-4=8. So, correct.\n\nBut wait, wait, the options include 8 as A and 24 as D. Did I make a mistake in the quadratic? Let me check the calculations again.\n\nSo, the equation after expanding was N\u00b2 -4N -96=0.\n\nWait, when I factor it, I thought (N-12)(N+8) gives N\u00b2 -4N -96. Let's check:\n\n(N-12)(N+8) = N\u00b2 +8N -12N -96 = N\u00b2 -4N -96. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, N=12 is the correct original number.\n\nSo, the number who attended is 12-4=8, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, the options given are:\n\nA)8\nB)12\nC)16\nD)24\nE)25\n\nSo, the correct answer is A)8.\n\n\nThe problem involves a group of friends planning to spend Rs. 96 on eatables, but four of them did not attend, causing the remaining friends to contribute Rs. 4 extra each.

Because of that, the ones who did come had to each contribute Rs. 4 extra. I need to find out how many attended the picnic.\n\nWait, so originally, all the friends were supposed to split the Rs. 96. But when four didn't come, the remaining had to pay more. So I think this is a problem involving division and maybe some equations.\n\nLet me denote the total number of friends as 'n'. So originally, each was supposed to pay 96 divided by n, right? So the initial share per person would be 96/n.\n\nBut four friends didn't come, so the number of people who attended is (n-4). Now, each of these (n-4) people had to pay Rs.4 more than they originally planned. So their new share is (96/n) + 4.\n\nAlternatively, the total amount is still Rs.96, so the new share per person is 96 divided by (n-4). So the equation I can write is:\n\n(96/n) + 4 = 96/(n-4)\n\nHmm, that makes sense. So now I have an equation in terms of n. I need to solve for n.\n\nLet me write it again:\n\n96/n + 4 = 96/(n -4)\n\nTo solve this, I'll multiply both sides by n(n-4) to eliminate the denominators.

Let's see:  -12 and +8? Because (-12) +8 =-4 and (-12)*8 =-96.\n\nYes, that works.
