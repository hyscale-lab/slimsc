      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this probability problem here about Mr. Jain betting on horses. Let me try to understand it step by step. \n\nThe question says there are 5 horses in a race. Mr. Jain selects two of them at random and bets on them. We need to find the probability that he selected the winning horse. Hmm, wait, but how does betting on two horses work? Oh, maybe it means he's betting that at least one of the two horses he picked will win. Or perhaps he's betting that both will win? Wait, no, I think in horse racing, if you bet on a horse, you win if that horse comes first. So if Mr. Jain is selecting two horses and betting on both, maybe he's hoping either one of them wins. But the question isn't entirely clear. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says, \"The probability that he selected the winning horse is...\" So, perhaps the problem is that he bets on two horses, and the probability that at least one of them is the winning horse. Because the winning horse is just one, right? Because in a race, only one horse wins, I guess. So, he picks two, and we want the chance that the winning horse is among those two.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another way to interpret it is: he bets on two horses, and the probability that he has the winning horse. But that might imply he's betting on each, but I'm not certain.\n\nLet me clarify. The winning horse is one specific horse. So, if he picks two horses, what's the probability that the winning horse is among those two.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to: there are 5 horses, one is the winner. Mr. Jain picks two at random. What is the probability that the winner is in his selected two.\n\nAh, that's a classic probability problem. So, the total number of possible ways he can select two horses is the combination of 5 taken 2 at a time. The number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways he can choose the winning horse and one other. So, how many ways are there to choose the winning horse plus another? Well, since the winning horse is one specific horse, the other can be any of the remaining 4. So, the number of favorable combinations is 4.\n\nWait, wait. No, wait. The total number of possible pairs is C(5,2) which is 10. The number of favorable pairs is the number of pairs that include the winning horse. Since the winning horse is one, the number of such pairs is C(4,1), which is 4. Because once you include the winning horse, you need to choose one more from the remaining four.\n\nSo the probability is favorable over total: 4/10, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 2/5. So the answer should be B.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the probability that the first horse he picks is the winner is 1/5. If he didn't pick the winner first, then the probability that the second horse is the winner is 4/4 (since one non-winning horse is already picked, wait no). Wait, let me think differently. The probability that either the first or the second horse he picks is the winner.\n\nAlternatively, the probability that he didn't pick the winner in either selection is (4/5) * (3/4) = 3/5. Because, first, he picks a non-winner (4/5 chance), then, from the remaining four, which now includes three non-winners, so 3/4. So the probability he didn't pick the winner is 3/5. Therefore, the probability he did pick the winner is 1 - 3/5 = 2/5. That's the same answer as before.\n\nSo yes, the correct answer is 2/5, which is option B.\n",

We need to find the probability that he selected the winning horse. The options are A) 1/5, B) 2/5, C) 3/5, D) 4/5, and E)6/5.\n\nHmm, wait a minute. Let me make sure I understand the setup correctly. So, in a race with five horses, each horse has an equal chance of winning, right? Because races are usually fair unless stated otherwise. So the probability that any one horse wins is 1/5.\n\nBut Mr. Jain is selecting two horses. He's not just picking one. So how does that affect the probability? Well, when he selects two horses, he's hoping that at least one of them is the winning horse. But wait, the question says, \"the probability that he selected the winning horse.\" Hmm, I need to clarify: does this mean that one of his two horses is the winner, or both of them?\n\nWait, the wording says, \"the probability that he selected the winning horse.\" So perhaps it's the probability that the winning horse is among his two chosen. Because he's betting on both, and if either of them wins, maybe he wins the bet. So we need the probability that the winning horse is in his selection of two.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is phrased differently. Let me think again. If the race has a single winner, then the probability that the winning horse is one of the two he picked is what we're looking for.\n\nSo, the problem is: given that there are 5 horses, and Mr. Jain picks two at random, what is the probability that the winning horse is among those two.\n\nHmm, okay. So the winning horse is one specific horse, and Mr. Jain has two. So the probability is the number of favorable outcomes over the total possible outcomes.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the probability that the winning horse is not selected, and then subtract that from 1.\n\nSo, the probability that the winning horse is not among the two he chose. How many horses are not the winner? There are four others. So he needs to choose two horses from the four non-winners.\n\nThe total number of ways he can choose two horses is C(5,2), which is 10. The number of ways he can choose two non-winning horses is C(4,2) which is 6. So the probability of not selecting the winner is 6/10, which simplifies to 3/5. Therefore, the probability of selecting the winner is 1 minus that, which is 1 - 3/5 = 2/5.\n\nWait, so that would be option B, 2/5.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the probability that the first horse he picks is the winner is 1/5. If he doesn't pick the winner first, he might pick the winner second. So the probability of the first horse not being the winner is 4/5, and then the second horse being the winner is 1/4 (since one non-winner was already picked). So the probability of picking the winner on the second try is (4/5)*(1/4) = 1/5.\n\nAdding both probabilities: 1/5 + 1/5 = 2/5. So again, 2/5, which is option B.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Alternatively, since the two selections are without replacement, the probability that the winning horse is among the two can be calculated by considering that each horse has an equal chance of being selected.\n\nAlternatively, the chance that the winning horse is selected is equal to the number of horses he picks divided by the total number of horses. So, 2/5. That's a quicker way, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think why.\n\nBecause each horse has an equal chance of being picked, and he's picking two. So the probability that any specific horse is picked is 2/5. Since the winning horse is one specific horse, the probability is 2/5.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So that's another way to see it.

Therefore, the probability of picking it is 1 - 3/5 = 2/5. Yep, same result.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B, 2/5.\n\n\nTo determine the probability that Mr. Jain selected the winning horse when he bets on two horses out of five, we analyze the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Total number of possible pairs**: The number of ways to select two horses from five is given by the combination formula:  \n   \\[\n   \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10\n   \\]\n\n2. **Number of favorable outcomes**: The winning horse is one specific horse. To include the winning horse in the selection, the second horse must be chosen from the remaining four. Thus, there are \\(4\\) favorable pairs.\n\n3. **Probability calculation**: The probability of selecting the winning horse is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total outcomes}} = \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Alternative verification**: The probability of not selecting the winning horse is:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{4}{5} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{3}{5}\n   \\]  \n   Therefore, the probability of selecting the winning horse is:  \n   \\[\n   1 - \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{2}{5}\n   \\]\n\nBoth methods confirm that the probability is \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the solution. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe question says: There are 5 horses in a race. Mr. Jain selects two of the horses at random and bets on them. The probability that he selected the winning horse is... and then there are five options to choose from.\n\nHmm. Wait, so the problem is about calculating the probability that Mr. Jain picked the winning horse when he selected two horses out of five. I think I need to model this scenario properly.\n\nLet me break it down. First, there are 5 horses. Let's assume that only one horse is the winner. So, each horse has an equal chance of winning, right? Or does the problem specify that? Oh, I think the problem assumes that each horse has an equal chance, but I'm not sure. Wait, the problem doesn't specify, but since it's a standard probability question, I think it's safe to assume that each horse has an equal probability of winning. So, each horse has a 1/5 chance of being the winner.\n\nWait, but Mr. Jain is selecting two horses. So, he's not betting on a single horse, but on two. So, the question is about the probability that at least one of the two horses he selects is the winning horse.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is phrased as the probability that he selected the winning horse. Hmm, that could be interpreted in two ways. Either he's picking two horses and wants at least one of them to be the winner, or perhaps he's selecting two and one of them is the winner. Wait, perhaps the wording is that he selects two, and the probability that one of them is the winning horse.\n\nWait, the exact wording is: \"The probability that he selected the winning horse is.\" So, maybe it's the probability that the winning horse is among the two he selected. Because he's betting on two, and the winning horse is one. So, we need the probability that the winning horse is in his two selected.\n\nLet me think about the possible approach.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose two horses out of five is the combination C(5,2). Let me calculate that. C(5,2) is 5!/(2!*(5-2)!) = (5*4)/(2*1) = 10 possible combinations.\n\nNow, how many of these combinations include the winning horse? Well, if the winning horse is one specific horse, say Horse A, then the number of ways to choose two horses that include Horse A is C(4,1), because we choose one more horse from the remaining four. So, C(4,1)=4.\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is 4, and the total possible outcomes are 10. So, the probability is 4/10, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the winning horse is only one, and the probability that Mr. Jain's two selected include that one.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the probability that the winning horse is in his two selected. So, the first horse he picks has a 2/5 chance of being the winner? No, wait. Because when selecting two horses, the order doesn't matter. So, perhaps the probability is 2/5, which is what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about it step by step: the chance that the winning horse is the first one he picks is 1/5. The chance that the winning horse is the second one he picks, given that the first wasn't the winner, would be (4/5)*(1/4) = 1/5. Because after picking one non-winning horse, there are four left, one of which is the winner. So, adding these together: 1/5 + 1/5 = 2/5. So, that's another way to reach the same answer.\n\nSo, in both methods, the probability is 2/5. Looking back at the options, option B is 2/5, so that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but I should make sure I'm not mixing up combinations and probabilities. Let me think again: the total number of possible pairs is 10, as calculated. The number of pairs that include the winning horse is 4. So, 4/10 is 2/5. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother way: The probability that the winning horse is selected in two tries. So, the probability that the winning horse is among the two selected is equal to 1 minus the probability that neither of the two selected is the winning horse.\n\nSo, the probability that the first horse selected is not the winner is 4/5. Then, the probability that the second horse selected is not the winner, given the first wasn't, is 3/4. So, the combined probability is (4/5)*(3/4) = 3/5. So, the probability that neither is the winner is 3/5. Therefore, the probability that at least one is the winner is 1 - 3/5 = 2/5. Which again gives the same answer.\n\nSo, all methods point to the same answer, 2/5, which is option B.\n",

Mr. Jain selects two of them at random and bets on them. We need to find the probability that he selected the winning horse. The options are A to E.\n\nHmm, wait a minute. The way the question is phrased, I think it's saying that there's one winning horse, right? Because usually, a race has one winner. So, if Mr. Jain picks two horses, what's the chance that at least one of them is the winner?\n\nWait, no. Wait, wait. Let me think again. Maybe the question is about him selecting two horses and the probability that he has the winning horse. Oh, but wait, each horse can only have one winner, so if he picks two, perhaps the chance that one of them is the winner is what we're calculating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about him selecting two horses, and the probability that both are the winning ones. No, that doesn't make sense because only one horse can be the winner. So, he can't have two winning horses. So that must not be the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to break it down. The problem is that he selects two horses at random and bets on them. The probability that he selected the winning horse. Hmm. So, does that mean that he's betting on both horses, and we want the probability that one of them is the winner? Or does it mean that he's betting on the two horses, and the winning horse is among them?\n\nWait, maybe the phrasing is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again. The probability that he selected the winning horse. Oh, wait, perhaps it's the probability that he selected the winning horse in his two choices. So, the winning horse is one specific horse, and he selects two. So the question is, what's the probability that the winning horse is among the two he chose.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the problem is: there are 5 horses, one of which is the winner. Mr. Jain selects two at random. What's the probability that the winning horse is among his two choices.\n\nSo, to find this probability, I can approach it in a couple of ways. One way is to compute the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nThe total number of ways he can select two horses out of five is the combination of 5 taken 2 at a time. The formula for combinations is nCr = n! / (r! (n-r)!).\n\nSo 5C2 is (5*4)/(2*1) = 10 possible ways.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways he can select two horses where one of them is the winning horse. How do I compute that?\n\nWell, the winning horse is one specific horse. So, if he must pick the winning horse, he has to choose one more horse from the remaining four. So the number of favorable outcomes is 4C1, because after choosing the winning horse, he selects one more from the other four.\n\n4C1 is 4. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 4.\n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check that. If the winning horse is fixed, the number of ways to choose two horses that include the winner is the number of ways to choose one more horse from the remaining four. So yes, 4.\n\nSo the probability is favorable / total = 4 / 10. Simplifying that, 4/10 is 2/5.\n\nSo the probability is 2/5, which corresponds to option B.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to think about the probability that the winning horse is selected. The first horse he picks has a 1/5 chance of being the winner. If he doesn't pick the winner on the first try, the second pick would have a 1/4 chance. Wait, but that's not the right approach because he's selecting two horses, not one after another.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to calculate the probability that he did NOT select the winning horse, and subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability that the first horse he picks is not the winner is 4/5. Then, the probability that the second horse he picks is also not the winner. Wait, but once he picks the first horse, there are 4 left, so the probability the second isn't the winner would be 3/4. But since he's selecting two horses, the order doesn't matter. So the probability that neither of the two is the winner is (4/5) * (3/4) = 3/5.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no, because when you select two horses, the order doesn't matter. So the probability that neither is the winner is (4C2)/5C2. 4C2 is 6, 5C2 is 10. So 6/10 = 3/5.\n\nSo the probability that at least one is the winner is 1 - 3/5 = 2/5. Which again gives us the same result.\n\nSo, the probability is 2/5, which is option B.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the chance that the winning horse is among the two he selects. Since each selection is equally likely, each horse has an equal chance of being selected. So the probability that the winning horse is selected is the same as the probability that, among the two selected, one is the winner. Since there are 5 horses, and he selects 2, each horse has a certain chance. Wait, perhaps not the best approach.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: each horse is equally likely to be selected. The chance that the winning horse is selected is the same as the probability that one of the two horses he picks is the winner. Since he's picking two, the probability is (number of winning positions)/(total possible positions). But perhaps this is complicating.\n\nAlternatively, since the winning horse is one specific horse, and he picks two, the probability that the winning horse is among those two is the same as the probability that the winning horse is in a randomly selected pair.\n\nWhich brings us back to the same calculation: 4/10, which is 2/5.\n\nSo, the correct answer must be B) 2/5.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question says that there are five horses in a race. Mr. Jain selects two of them at random and bets on them. We need to find the probability that he selected the winning horse. The options are A to E.\n\nHmm, wait a minute. The way the question is phrased, I think it's saying that there's one winning horse, right? Because usually, a race has one winner. So, if Mr. Jain picks two horses, what's the chance that at least one of them is the winner?\n\nWait, no. Wait, wait. Let me think again. Maybe the question is about him selecting two horses and the probability that he has the winning horse. Oh, but wait, each horse can only have one winner, so if he picks two, perhaps the chance that one of them is the winner is what we're calculating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about him selecting two horses, and the probability that both are the winning ones. No, that doesn't make sense because only one horse can be the winner. So, he can't have two winning horses. So that must not be the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to break it down. The problem is that he selects two horses at random and bets on them. The probability that he selected the winning horse. Hmm. So, does that mean that he's betting on both horses, and we want the probability that one of them is the winner? Or does it mean that he's betting on the two horses, and the winning horse is among them?\n\nWait, maybe the phrasing is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again. The probability that he selected the winning horse. Oh, wait, perhaps it's the probability that he selected the winning horse in his two choices. So, the winning horse is one specific horse, and he selects two. So the question is, what's the probability that the winning horse is among the two he chose.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the problem is: there are 5 horses, one of which is the winner. Mr. Jain selects two at random. What's the probability that the winning horse is among his two choices.\n\nSo, to find this probability, I can approach it in a couple of ways. One way is to compute the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nThe total number of ways he can select two horses out of five is the combination of 5 taken 2 at a time. The formula for combinations is nCr = n! / (r!

So, I think I need to find the probability that at least one of the two horses he picks is the winner. Or maybe the question is phrased differently. Let me read it again.

No, I think in betting on two horses, you win if either one of them wins.

So, the way to approach this is to compute the number of favorable outcomes over total possible outcomes.\n\nTotal possible outcomes when selecting two horses out of five: that's the combination of 5 horses taken 2 at a time. The formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n!/(k! (n-k)!)).\n\nSo, 5 choose 2 is (5*4)/(2*1) = 10.

Let's assume there's only one winning horse.\n\nSo, if one horse is the winner, how many ways can he pick two horses that include this winner?\n\nWell, he has to choose the winner and one other horse. So, the number of ways is 4, because there are four other horses. So, for each of the four others, he could pair them with the winner.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think. If the winning horse is one specific horse, then the number of favorable selections is the number of ways to choose one more horse from the remaining four. So, 4 choose 1 is 4.\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is 4.\n\nTotal possible is 10.\n\nSo, the probability is 4/10, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of probability when selecting two horses. What's the probability that the winning horse is among them.\n\nAlternatively, the probability that he didn't pick the winning horse is the probability that both of his choices are from the other four. So, the probability of not picking the winner is (4/5) * (3/4) = 12/20 = 3/5. Because first, he picks any horse that's not the winner (4/5 chance), and then the second horse must also not be the winner, but since he's picking without replacement, it's 3/4.\n\nSo, the probability that he did pick the winner is 1 minus the probability of not picking it. So, 1 - 3/5 = 2/5.\n\nHmm, that's the same as before. So, the probability is 2/5, which corresponds to option B.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Another approach: the chance that he picks the winning horse in his first selection is 1/5. Then, the chance that he picks it in the second selection, given he didn't pick it first, is 1/4. So, the total probability is (1/5) + (4/5)*(1/4) = 1/5 + 1/5 = 2/5. Because the first term is the probability of selecting the winner first, and the second term is the probability of not selecting it first (4/5) and then selecting it second (1 out of the remaining 4).\n\nSo that also gives 2/5, which is option B.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be option B, 2/5.\n",

Mr. Jain selects two of them at random and bets on them. We need to find the probability that he selected the winning horse. The options are A to E, with fractions like 1/5, 2/5, etc.\n\nHmm, wait. So the setup is that there are five horses, and only one of them is the winning horse, right? Because in a race, usually, there's one winner. So Mr. Jain picks two horses randomly, and we want the probability that at least one of those two is the winner.\n\nWait, or does the question mean that he selected two, and we're to find the probability that both are the winning ones? No, because in a race, the winning horse is just one. So if he picks two, the only way he wins is if at least one of them is the correct one. So the question is about the probability that he picked the winning horse among his two selections.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The way the question is phrased: \"the probability that he selected the winning horse.\" So he picks two, and we want the probability that one of them is the winner. So it's like, what's the chance that the winning horse is among the two he chose.\n\nSo, to model this, I should think about the number of ways he can pick two horses, and the number of ways that include the winning horse.\n\nThe total number of possible pairs he can choose is the combination of 5 horses taken 2 at a time. The formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n!/(k! (n-k)!)). So 5 choose 2 is (5*4)/(2*1) = 10. So there are 10 possible pairs.\n\nNow, how many of those pairs include the winning horse? Well, the winning horse is one specific horse, so the other horse in the pair can be any of the remaining four. So there are 4 possible pairs that include the winning horse. Because for each of the other four horses, pairing them with the winner gives a valid pair. So that's 4 favorable outcomes.\n\nSo the probability is the number of favorable over total, which is 4/10. Simplifying that gives 2/5. So the probability is 2/5.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 2/5. So the correct answer should be B.\n\nWait, but wait another thought: Alternatively, maybe the question is phrased differently. Because sometimes in probability, you can approach it from another angle, like the probability of the winning horse being the first one selected, or the second, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of each horse's chance of being selected. The probability that the winning horse is selected in the two picks. So the probability that the winning horse is picked in the two selections is equal to 1 minus the probability that it's not picked in either selection.\n\nSo the probability that the winning horse is not selected is (4/5) * (3/4) = (4/5)*(3/4) = 3/5. Because for the first pick, there are 4 non-winning horses out of 5. Then, for the second pick, since one non-winning has already been picked, there are 3 left out of 4.\n\nWait, no, wait. Because the selection is without replacement. So for the first pick, the chance that it's not the winner is 4/5. Then, given that the first pick wasn't the winner, the chance the second pick isn't the winner is 3/4. So the probability that neither is the winner is (4/5)*(3/4) = 3/5. So the probability that at least one is the winner is 1 - 3/5 = 2/5. Which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nSo yeah, that confirms that the probability is 2/5, so option B is correct.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. \n\nThe question says there are five horses in a race. Mr. Jain selects two of them at random and bets on them. We need to find the probability that he selected the winning horse. The options are A to E, with fractions like 1/5, 2/5, etc.\n\nHmm, wait. So the setup is that there are five horses, and only one of them is the winning horse, right? Because in a race, usually, there's one winner. So Mr. Jain picks two horses randomly, and we want the probability that at least one of those two is the winner.\n\nWait, or does the question mean that he selected two, and we're to find the probability that both are the winning ones? No, because in a race, the winning horse is just one. So if he picks two, the only way he wins is if at least one of them is the correct one. So the question is about the probability that he picked the winning horse among his two selections.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The way the question is phrased: \"the probability that he selected the winning horse.\" So he picks two, and we want the probability that one of them is the winner. So it's like, what's the chance that the winning horse is among the two he chose.\n\nSo, to model this, I should think about the number of ways he can pick two horses, and the number of ways that include the winning horse.\n\nThe total number of possible pairs he can choose is the combination of 5 horses taken 2 at a time. The formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n!/(k! (n-k)!)). So 5 choose 2 is (5*4)/(2*1) = 10. So there are 10 possible pairs.\n\nNow, how many of those pairs include the winning horse? Well, the winning horse is one specific horse, so the other horse in the pair can be any of the remaining four. So there are 4 possible pairs that include the winning horse. Because for each of the other four horses, pairing them with the winner gives a valid pair. So that's 4 favorable outcomes.\n\nSo the probability is the number of favorable over total, which is 4/10. Simplifying that gives 2/5. So the probability is 2/5.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 2/5. So the correct answer should be B.\n\nWait, but wait another thought: Alternatively, maybe the question is phrased differently. Because sometimes in probability, you can approach it from another angle, like the probability of the winning horse being the first one selected, or the second, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of each horse's chance of being selected. The probability that the winning horse is selected in the two picks. So the probability that the winning horse is picked in the two selections is equal to 1 minus the probability that it's not picked in either selection.\n\nSo the probability that the winning horse is not selected is (4/5) * (3/4) = (4/5)*(3/4) = 3/5. Because for the first pick, there are 4 non-winning horses out of 5. Then, for the second pick, since one non-winning has already been picked, there are 3 left out of 4.\n\nWait, no, wait. Because the selection is without replacement. So for the first pick, the chance that it's not the winner is 4/5. Then, given that the first pick wasn't the winner, the chance the second pick isn't the winner is 3/4. So the probability that neither is the winner is (4/5)*(3/4) = 3/5. So the probability that at least one is the winner is 1 - 3/5 = 2/5. Which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nSo yeah, that confirms that the probability is 2/5, so option B is correct.\n\n\nTo determine the probability that Mr. Jain selected the winning horse when he bets on two horses out of five, we analyze the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Total number of possible pairs**: Mr. Jain selects two horses out of five.
