      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about three bells ringing at different intervals, and I need to figure out when they'll all ring together again. Hmm, let's see. The intervals are 36 seconds, 40 seconds, and 48 seconds. They start together, and I need to find the next time they all coincide again.\n\nWait, I remember something about least common multiples (LCM) being used in these kinds of problems. Oh right, because when things repeat at intervals, their combined repeating happens at the LCM of those intervals. So the time when all three bells ring together again is the LCM of 36, 40, and 48 seconds.\n\nBut wait, how do I calculate the LCM of these numbers? Let me think. I think the method involves prime factorization. So let's break each number down into its prime factors.\n\nStarting with 36: 36 divided by 2 is 18, then 18 divided by 2 is 9. 9 divided by 3 is 3, and then 3 divided by 3 is 1. So the prime factors are 2^2 * 3^2.\n\nNext, 40: 40 divided by 2 is 20, 20 divided by 2 is 10, 10 divided by 2 is 5, and 5 divided by 5 is 1. So that's 2^3 * 5^1.\n\nThen, 48: 48 divided by 2 is 24, 24/2 is 12, 12/2 is 6, 6/2 is 3, and 3/3 is 1. So that's 2^4 * 3^1.\n\nNow, the LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes present. So for each prime:\n\n- For 2: the highest exponent is 4 (from 48).\n- For 3: the highest exponent is 2 (from 36).\n- For 5: the highest exponent is 1 (from 40).\n\nSo LCM = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5^1. Let me calculate that.\n\n2^4 is 16. 3^2 is 9. 5 is 5. So 16 * 9 is 144. 144 *5 is 720. So the LCM is 720 seconds.\n\nWait, but the options are given in minutes. So how many minutes is 720 seconds? Since 1 minute is 60 seconds, I divide 720 by 60. 720/60 is 12. So 12 minutes.\n\nLooking at the options, B is After 12 minutes. So that should be the correct answer. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n36: 2^2 * 3^2. Correct. 40: 2^3 *5. Correct. 48: 2^4 *3. Correct. The LCM uses the max exponents for each prime. So 2^4 is 16, 3^2 is 9, 5 is 5. 16*9=144, 144*5=720. Yes, that's right.\n\n720 seconds is 12 minutes. So the answer should be B.\n",

Factors:\n\n36: 2^2 * 3^2\n40: 2^3 *5^1\n48: 2^4 *3^1\n\nSo for LCM, take the max exponents:\n- 2^4 (since 48 has 2^4)\n- 3^2 (since 36 has 3^2)\n- 5^1 (since 40 has 5^1)\n\nSo yes, 2^4=16, 3^2=9, 5^1=5. 16*9 is 144, 144*5=720. 720 seconds is indeed 12 minutes.\n\nSo the answer is B, after 12 minutes.\n\n\nTo determine when the three bells will ring together again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their intervals: 36 seconds, 40 seconds, and 48 seconds. The LCM is the smallest time that is a multiple of all three intervals.\n\nFirst, we factorize each interval into its prime factors:\n- \\( 36 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\)\n- \\( 40 = 2^3 \\times 5^1 \\)\n- \\( 48 = 2^4 \\times 3^1 \\)\n\nTo calculate the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime number present:\n- For \\( 2 \\), the highest power is \\( 2^4 \\) (from 48).\n- For \\( 3 \\), the highest power is \\( 3^2 \\) (from 36).\n- For \\( 5 \\), the highest power is \\( 5^1 \\) (from 40).\n\nThus, the LCM is:\n\\[\n\\text{LCM} = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1 = 16 \\times 9 \\times 5 = 720 \\, \\text{seconds}.\n\\]\n\nConverting 720 seconds to minutes:\n\\[\n720 \\, \\text{seconds} \\div 60 = 12 \\, \\text{minutes}.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the bells will ring together again after **12 minutes**.

The question is asking when they'll all ring together again after starting at the same time. \n\nHmm, I remember from math class that when things happen at regular intervals, the time they all coincide again is related to the least common multiple (LCM) of their intervals. Right, because the LCM of their times will give the smallest number that's a multiple of all three, meaning that's when they all ring together.\n\nSo the intervals are 36 seconds, 40 seconds, and 48 seconds. I need to find the LCM of these three numbers. But wait, how do I compute the LCM of three numbers? I think the process is similar to finding the LCM of two numbers. Maybe I can break it down into steps.\n\nFirst, I'll find the LCM of the first two numbers, 36 and 40, and then find the LCM of that result with the third number, 48. \n\nTo find the LCM of 36 and 40, I'll start by finding their prime factors. \n\n36 can be factored into 2^2 * 3^2. Let me check: 2*2=4, 4*9=36. Yep, that's right.\n\n40 factors into 2^3 * 5^1.

Let's factorize both.\n\n360: Let's see, 360 divided by 2 is 180, again by 2 is 90, again by 2 is 45. So that's 2^3. 45 is 9*5, so 3^2 *5^1. So 360 is 2^3 * 3^2 *5^1.\n\n48: Let's factor it. 48 divided by 2 is 24, again 12, again 6, again 3. So that's 2^4 *3^1.\n\nNow, for LCM, take the highest exponents:\n\n- For 2: max(3,4) is 4.\n- For 3: max(2,1) is 2.\n- For 5: max(1,0) is 1 (since 48 doesn't have a 5).\n\nSo LCM is 2^4 *3^2 *5^1.\n\nCalculating that: 2^4 is 16, 3^2 is 9, 5 is 5. 16 *9 is 144. 144 *5 is 720.

They all start ringing together at the same time, and I need to figure out when they'll all ring together again. Hmm, I remember from math class that this has something to do with the least common multiple, or LCM. But wait, how does that exactly work here?\n\nLet me think. Each bell rings every so often, right? So the first bell rings every 36 seconds, the second every 40, and the third every 48. We're looking for the next time they all ring at the same moment again. That would be the smallest time that's a multiple of all three intervals. Oh yeah, that's the LCM of 36, 40, and 48.\n\nSo I need to compute the LCM of these three numbers. How do I do that? I think the method involves prime factorization. Let me try breaking each number down into its prime factors.\n\nStarting with 36: 36 divided by 2 is 18, divided by 2 again is 9. Then 9 is 3 squared. So 36 is 2\u00b2 * 3\u00b2.\n\nNext, 40: 40 divided by 2 is 20, divided by 2 is 10, then 2 again is 5. So 40 is 2\u00b3 * 5\u00b9.\n\nThen 48: 48 divided by 2 is 24, divided by 2 is 12, then 6, then 3. So that's 2\u2074 * 3\u00b9.\n\nNow, for the LCM, I take the highest power of each prime number present in the factorizations. So the primes here are 2, 3, and 5.\n\nThe highest power of 2 is 2\u2074 from 48. The highest power of 3 is 3\u00b2 from 36. And the highest power of 5 is 5\u00b9 from 40.\n\nSo the LCM would be 2\u2074 * 3\u00b2 * 5\u00b9. Let me calculate that.\n\n2\u2074 is 16. 3\u00b2 is 9. 16 multiplied by 9 is 144. Then 144 multiplied by 5 is 720.\n\nWait, so the LCM is 720 seconds. Oh right, because the intervals are in seconds. Now, converting 720 seconds into minutes, since the options are in minutes. 60 seconds in a minute, so 720 divided by 60 is 12. So 12 minutes.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is after 12 minutes. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations. Did I compute the LCM correctly?\n\n36: 2\u00b2 * 3\u00b2\n40: 2\u00b3 *5\n48: 2\u2074 *3\nSo LCM is 2\u2074 (since 48 has the highest power of 2), 3\u00b2 (since 36 has the higher power of 3), and 5\u00b9.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem where three bells are ringing at intervals of 36 seconds, 40 seconds, and 48 seconds. They all start ringing together at the same time, and I need to figure out when they'll all ring together again. Hmm, I remember from math class that this has something to do with the least common multiple, or LCM. But wait, how does that exactly work here?\n\nLet me think. Each bell rings every so often, right? So the first bell rings every 36 seconds, the second every 40, and the third every 48. We're looking for the next time they all ring at the same moment again. That would be the smallest time that's a multiple of all three intervals. Oh yeah, that's the LCM of 36, 40, and 48.\n\nSo I need to compute the LCM of these three numbers. How do I do that? I think the method involves prime factorization. Let me try breaking each number down into its prime factors.\n\nStarting with 36: 36 divided by 2 is 18, divided by 2 again is 9. Then 9 is 3 squared. So 36 is 2\u00b2 * 3\u00b2.\n\nNext, 40: 40 divided by 2 is 20, divided by 2 is 10, then 2 again is 5. So 40 is 2\u00b3 * 5\u00b9.\n\nThen 48: 48 divided by 2 is 24, divided by 2 is 12, then 6, then 3. So that's 2\u2074 * 3\u00b9.\n\nNow, for the LCM, I take the highest power of each prime number present in the factorizations. So the primes here are 2, 3, and 5.\n\nThe highest power of 2 is 2\u2074 from 48. The highest power of 3 is 3\u00b2 from 36. And the highest power of 5 is 5\u00b9 from 40.\n\nSo the LCM would be 2\u2074 * 3\u00b2 * 5\u00b9. Let me calculate that.\n\n2\u2074 is 16. 3\u00b2 is 9. 16 multiplied by 9 is 144. Then 144 multiplied by 5 is 720.\n\nWait, so the LCM is 720 seconds. Oh right, because the intervals are in seconds. Now, converting 720 seconds into minutes, since the options are in minutes. 60 seconds in a minute, so 720 divided by 60 is 12. So 12 minutes.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is after 12 minutes. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations. Did I compute the LCM correctly?\n\n36: 2\u00b2 * 3\u00b2\n40: 2\u00b3 *5\n48: 2\u2074 *3\nSo LCM is 2\u2074 (since 48 has the highest power of 2), 3\u00b2 (since 36 has the higher power of 3), and 5\u00b9. So 16 *9=144, 144*5=720. Yep, that's 720 seconds. 720/60 is indeed 12 minutes. So yeah, B is correct.\n\n\nTo determine when the three bells will ring together again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their intervals: 36 seconds, 40 seconds, and 48 seconds.
