      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a sale and discounts. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that there's a 20% discount on all articles. Vinit bought an article for Rs.4578 during the sale. The question is asking for the actual selling price of the article. Wait, wait, that's a bit confusing. Oh, wait, no, wait. The actual selling price before the discount? Or is it the original price?\n\nWait, I think I need to clarify. So, the article was bought for Rs.4578 after a 20% discount. So, the Rs.4578 is the price after the discount, right? Because the discount is applied, so the selling price is lower than the original. So, the actual selling price is the original price minus 20% discount.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the question is phrased a bit differently. It says, \"what was the actual selling price of the article?\" Hmm. Oh, maybe the term 'actual selling price' refers to the original price before the discount. Because during the sale, the price was discounted, so the Rs.4578 is the discounted price. So, the actual selling price (original) is higher than that.\n\nSo, the problem is: the discounted price is 80% of the original. Because 20% off means you pay 80% of the original price. So, if the discounted price is Rs.4578, then that's 80% of the original price. So, to find the original price, I need to calculate what number, when multiplied by 0.8, gives 4578.\n\nSo, mathematically, original price * 0.8 = 4578. So, original price = 4578 / 0.8.\n\nLet me compute that. 4578 divided by 0.8. Hmm. 0.8 is 4/5, so dividing by 0.8 is the same as multiplying by 5/4. So, 4578 * (5/4).\n\nWait, wait, let me think again. 4578 divided by 0.8. Let's compute that.\n\nSo, 4578 divided by 0.8.\n\nWell, 4578 divided by 0.8. Let's see:\n\nAlternatively, 0.8 is 4/5, so 4578 / (4/5) = 4578 * (5/4).\n\nSo, 4578 * 5 = ?\n\nLet me compute 4578 *5:\n\n4578 *5: 4000*5=20000, 500*5=2500, 70*5=350, 8*5=40. So adding all together: 20000 + 2500=22500, +350=22850, +40=22890.\n\nSo, 4578 *5=22890.\n\nNow, divide by 4: 22890 /4.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n22890 divided by 4:\n\n4 *5000=20000, so 22890 -20000=2890.\n\nNow, 2890 divided by 4 is 722.5.\n\nSo, 5000 +722.5 =5722.5.\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right. Because 4578 is 80% of the original. So, 4578 * (5/4) is 5722.5. But looking at the options, I don't see that number. The options are:\n\nA)5050\nB)5723\nC)5040\nD)4950\nE)4870\n\nWait, so 5722.5 is close to option B which is 5723. So that's probably the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAnother way to compute 4578 divided by 0.8:\n\nLet's do it as a decimal division.\n\n4578 / 0.8.\n\nWell, 0.8 is the same as 8/10, so dividing by 0.8 is the same as multiplying by 10/8, which simplifies to 5/4, so same as before.\n\nBut let me compute 4578 divided by 0.8 using another method.\n\nLet me think of 0.8 as 8 * 0.1. So, 4578 /0.8 = (4578 *10) /8 = 45780/8.\n\nSo, 45780 divided by 8.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n8 *5000=40000, 45780-40000=5780.\n\n8*700=5600, so 5780-5600=180.\n\n8*22=176. 180-176=4.\n\nSo, 5000 +700 +22 =5722, and 4/8=0.5. So total is 5722.5.\n\nYes, same result as before.\n\nSo, the original price was 5722.5, which is Rs.5722.5. But looking at the options, option B is 5723. So, that must be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but the options are all in whole numbers. So, the answer would be 5723, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, let me think again about the problem statement. It says, \"the actual selling price.\" Hmm. Maybe I got it wrong. Because sometimes, the terms can be confusing.\n\nWait, the article was purchased for Rs.4578 in the sale, which is after the discount. So, the Rs.4578 is the discounted price. The actual selling price before the discount would have been higher. So, the original price is 5722.5, which is approximately 5723, so option B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the selling price after the discount, which would be Rs.4578, but that's not any of the options. So, no, that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.\n\n\"In a sale, a discount of 20% was available on all the articles. If Vinit purchased an article for Rs.4578 in the sale. What was the actual selling price of the article?\"\n\nHmm. Oh wait, maybe the actual selling price is the original price, not the discounted one. Because the sale is on, so the discounted price is the amount paid. The actual selling price would be the original. So, yes, I think I did it right.\n\nSo, the answer should be 5723, which is option B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the actual selling price of the article before the discount, we know that the Rs. 4578 paid by Vinit is the price after a 20% discount.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a discount during a sale. Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nThe question says that there's a 20% discount on all articles, and Vinit bought an article for Rs.4578. They're asking what the actual selling price was. Wait, wait. Hmm, wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me read it again. Oh, wait, maybe I got it wrong. The question is about the actual selling price, but Vinit bought it for 4578. Oh, no, wait. Wait, no\u2014wait, if it's a discount, then the price he paid would be the discounted price, right? So the selling price after discount is 4578, and we need to find the original price before the discount.\n\nSo the discount is 20%, which means the customer pays 80% of the original price. Because 100% minus 20% discount is 80%. So, if I let the original price be X, then after a 20% discount, the selling price is 80% of X, which is 0.8 * X. \n\nAnd according to the problem, this discounted price is Rs.4578. So, 0.8 * X = 4578. I need to solve for X. \n\nLet me write that equation down: 0.8X = 4578. To find X, I can divide both sides by 0.8. So X = 4578 / 0.8. Let me calculate that. \n\nWait, 4578 divided by 0.8. Hmm, 0.8 is the same as 4/5, right? So dividing by 0.8 is the same as multiplying by 5/4. So 4578 * (5/4) is what I need to compute.\n\nLet me compute 4578 * 5 first. 4578 *5. Let's see: 4000*5=20000, 500*5=2500, 78*5=390. So adding them up: 20000 + 2500 is 22500, plus 390 is 22890. Now, divide that by 4. 22890 /4.\n\nWait, 22890 divided by 4. Let's see: 22,890 \u00f7 4. 4 goes into 22 five times (5*4=20), remainder 2. Bring down the 8: 28. 4 goes into 28 seven times (7*4=28), remainder 0. Bring down the 9: 09. 4 goes into 9 twice (2*4=8), remainder 1. Bring down the 0: 10. 4 goes into 10 two times (2*4=8), remainder 2. So that gives me 5722.5? Wait, wait, that can't be right because 4 into 22890 is 5722.5. But wait, the original price should be a whole number since we're dealing with currency.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in my calculation. Let me try a different approach. Let's see, 4578 divided by 0.8. Alternatively, 0.8 is 8/10, so dividing by 8/10 is the same as multiplying by 10/8, which simplifies to 5/4. So 4578 * 5 = 22890, then divided by 4. \n\nWait, 22890 divided by 4: Let me compute it step by step. 4 into 22 is 5, 5*4=20, remainder 2. Bring down 8: 28. 4 into 28 is 7, 7*4=28, no remainder. Bring down 9: 9 divided by 4 is 2, with a remainder of 1. Bring down 0: 10. 4 into 10 is 2, remainder 2. So that gives us 5722.5? Wait, but that's 5722.5, which is 5722 and a half. But prices are in whole rupees, so maybe I messed up the calculation somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check my multiplication. Let me compute 4578 * 5 again. 4578 *5: \n\n4000 *5=20000, \n500 *5=2500, \n70 *5=350, \n8 *5=40. \nWait, no, wait: 4578 is 4000 + 500 + 70 +8. So 4000*5=20000, 500*5=2500, 70*5=350, 8*5=40. Adding all together: 20000 +2500=22500, +350=22850, +40=22890. So that's correct. Now, 22890 divided by 4 is 5722.5. Hmm, that's 5722.5 rupees, which is 5722 and a half, which is 5722.50. But that's a fractional value. Is that possible? In real life, prices are usually in whole numbers, but maybe this is a theoretical question. \n\nLooking at the options, I see option B is 5723. Let me check that. 5722.5 is approximately 5723 when rounded to the nearest whole number. So maybe that's the correct option.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Maybe the 20% discount was on the actual selling price, not on the original. Or perhaps I got the question wrong. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question says: \"a discount of 20% was available on all the articles. If Vinit purchased an article for Rs.4578 in the sale.\" So the purchase price is after the discount. So the original price must be higher. So yes, the original price would be 4578 divided by 0.8, which is 5722.5, so approximately 5723. So the answer should be option B: 5723.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again, the choices are:\n\nA) 5050\n\nB)5723\n\nC)5040\n\nD)4950\n\nE)4870\n\nSo option B is 5723, which matches my calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the marked price, not the original. Or maybe I should think in terms of the discount being subtracted.\n\nAnother approach: If the selling price after a 20% discount is Rs.4578, then the selling price is 80% of the original. So, original price * 0.8 = 4578. So original price = 4578 / 0.8.\n\nLet me compute 4578 divided by 0.8. \n\n4578 \u00f7 0.8 = (4578 *10) /8 = 45780 /8.\n\nCompute 45780 \u00f78:\n\n8 \u00d7 5000 =40000, so subtract 40000 from 45780: 5780 left.\n\n8 \u00d7 700=5600. 5780-5600=180.\n\n8 \u00d722=176. 180-176=4. So so far, 5000+700=5700, plus 22 is 5722, and the remainder is 4. So 4/8=0.5. So 5722.5. So again, 5722.5, which is 5722 and a half, which is 5722.50.\n\nBut the options don't have 5722.5. The closest is option B: 5723.\n\nSo the answer should be B) 5723.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the original selling price of the article before the 20% discount, we start by noting that the discounted price Vinit paid is Rs. 4578.

So 4578 * 5 = 22890, then divided by 4. \n\nWait, 22890 divided by 4: Let me compute it step by step. 4 into 22 is 5, 5*4=20, remainder 2. Bring down 8: 28. 4 into 28 is 7, 7*4=28, no remainder. Bring down 9: 9 divided by 4 is 2, with a remainder of 1. Bring down 0: 10. 4 into 10 is 2, remainder 2. So that gives us 5722.5? Wait, but that's 5722.5, which is 5722 and a half. But prices are in whole rupees, so maybe I messed up the calculation somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check my multiplication. Let me compute 4578 * 5 again. 4578 *5: \n\n4000 *5=20000, \n500 *5=2500, \n70 *5=350, \n8 *5=40. \nWait, no, wait: 4578 is 4000 + 500 + 70 +8. So 4000*5=20000, 500*5=2500, 70*5=350, 8*5=40. Adding all together: 20000 +2500=22500, +350=22850, +40=22890. So that's correct. Now, 22890 divided by 4 is 5722.5. Hmm, that's 5722.5 rupees, which is 5722 and a half, which is 5722.50. But that's a fractional value. Is that possible? In real life, prices are usually in whole numbers, but maybe this is a theoretical question. \n\nLooking at the options, I see option B is 5723. Let me check that. 5722.5 is approximately 5723 when rounded to the nearest whole number. So maybe that's the correct option.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Maybe the 20% discount was on the actual selling price, not on the original. Or perhaps I got the question wrong. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question says: \"a discount of 20% was available on all the articles. If Vinit purchased an article for Rs.4578 in the sale.\" So the purchase price is after the discount. So the original price must be higher. So yes, the original price would be 4578 divided by 0.8, which is 5722.5, so approximately 5723. So the answer should be option B: 5723.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again, the choices are:\n\nA) 5050\n\nB)5723\n\nC)5040\n\nD)4950\n\nE)4870\n\nSo option B is 5723, which matches my calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the marked price, not the original. Or maybe I should think in terms of the discount being subtracted.\n\nAnother approach: If the selling price after a 20% discount is Rs.4578, then the selling price is 80% of the original. So, original price * 0.8 = 4578. So original price = 4578 / 0.8.\n\nLet me compute 4578 divided by 0.8. \n\n4578 \u00f7 0.8 = (4578 *10) /8 = 45780 /8.\n\nCompute 45780 \u00f78:\n\n8 \u00d7 5000 =40000, so subtract 40000 from 45780: 5780 left.\n\n8 \u00d7 700=5600. 5780-5600=180.\n\n8 \u00d722=176. 180-176=4. So so far, 5000+700=5700, plus 22 is 5722, and the remainder is 4. So 4/8=0.5. So 5722.5. So again, 5722.5, which is 5722 and a half, which is 5722.50.\n\nBut the options don't have 5722.5. The closest is option B: 5723.\n\nSo the answer should be B) 5723.\n\n\nTo determine the original selling price of the article before the 20% discount, we start by noting that the discounted price Vinit paid is Rs. 4578. Since the discount is 20%, the customer pays 80% of the original price. Let the original price be \\( X \\). Then:\n\n\\[\n0.8X = 4578\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( X \\), divide both sides by 0.8:\n\n\\[\nX = \\frac{4578}{0.8}\n\\]\n\nThis is equivalent to multiplying by \\( \\frac{5}{4} \\):\n\n\\[\nX = 4578 \\times \\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{4578 \\times 5}{4}\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( 4578 \\times 5 \\):\n\n\\[\n4578 \\times 5 = 22890\n\\]\n\nNow, divide \\( 22890 \\) by 4:\n\n\\[\n22890 \\div 4 = 5722.5\n\\]\n\nSince prices are typically expressed in whole numbers, we round \\( 5722.5 \\) to the nearest whole number, which is \\( 5723 \\). Comparing this result with the options provided, the closest match is:\n\n**B) 5723**\n\nThus, the original selling price of the article was Rs. 5723.\n\nAnswer: B",

Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says: In a sale, a discount of 20% was available on all the articles. Vinit purchased an article for Rs.4578 in the sale. What was the actual selling price of the article?\n\nWait, wait. Hmm. So, the discount is 20%, and Vinit bought the article for 4578 after the discount. We need to find the actual selling price before the discount, I think. Or wait, wait\u2014no, the question is a bit confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, when a discount is given, the selling price is the price after the discount. So, the actual selling price would be the original price minus the discount. But the way the question is phrased is a bit tricky. Let me think.\n\nWait, the problem says Vinit purchased the article for Rs.4578 in the sale. So that must be the price after the discount, right? Because the sale has a 20% discount. So the Rs.4578 is the selling price after the 20% discount was applied. So the actual selling price would be the original price, which would be higher than 4578. Because when you apply a discount, the price goes down.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the actual selling price. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me parse the question again. The options are given as A) 5050, B)5723, C)5040, D)4950, E)4870.\n\nWait, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me think about what each term means. So, when an article is sold at a discount, the selling price is the price after the discount. So, if the original price is P, and the discount is 20%, then the selling price is P minus 20% of P, which is P*(1 - 0.20) = P*0.80.\n\nIn this case, Vinit bought the article for Rs.4578, which is the selling price after the discount. So, 4578 = P * 0.80. Therefore, to find P, the original price, I need to divide 4578 by 0.80.\n\nLet me do that calculation. 4578 divided by 0.8. Hmm, what's 4578 \u00f7 0.8?\n\nLet me compute this step by step. Alternatively, I can think of 0.8 as 4/5. So dividing by 4/5 is the same as multiplying by 5/4. So 4578 * (5/4) = ?\n\nLet me compute 4578 * 5 first. 4578 * 5: 4000*5=20000, 500*5=2500, 70*5=350, 8*5=40. So adding them up: 20000 + 2500 is 22500, plus 350 is 22850, plus 40 is 22890.\n\nNow, divide that by 4: 22890 /4. Let me compute that. 4 into 22 is 5, 5*4=20, remainder 2. Bring down 8: 28. 4 into 28 is 7. 7*4=28, no remainder. Bring down 9: 9. 4 into 9 is 2, 2*4=8, remainder 1. Bring down 0: 10. 4 into 10 is 2, 2*4=8, remainder 2. Bring down the next 0 (since 22890 is 22890.000...). Wait, I'm not sure if I'm doing this correctly. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, 4 into 22 is 5, 5*4=20, remainder 2. So 22890 \u00f74: \n\nLet me compute it step by step:\n4 ) 22890\n\n- 4 into 2 is 0, but 4 into 22 is 5. 5*4=20. Subtract: 22-20=2.\nBring down the 8: 28.\n4 into 28 is 7. 7*4=28. Subtract: 0.\nBring down 9: 09.\n4 into 9 is 2. 2*4=8. Subtract: 1.\nBring down 0: 10.\n4 into 10 is 2. 2*4=8. Subtract: 2.\nBring down 0: 20.\n4 into 20 is 5. 5*4=20. Subtract: 0.\n\nSo putting it all together: 5,7,2,2,5. So 5722.5? Wait, no, that's not matching the options. Wait, the options are all integers. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate 4578 divided by 0.8.\n\nAlternatively, 0.8 is 4/5. So 4578 * (5/4) = ?\n\n4578 * 5 is 22890. Then divide by 4. 22890 \u00f74.\n\n22890 /4: 4*5000=20000. 22890-20000=2890. 4*700=2800. 2890-2800=90. 4*22=88. 90-88=2. So 5000 + 700 +22= 5722, with a remainder of 2. So 5722.5.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 5722.5. Looking at the options: A)5050, B)5723, C)5040, D)4950, E)4870.\n\nWait, option B is 5723. But my calculation gives 5722.5. Hmm. Close but not exact. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's compute 4578 divided by 0.8.\n\n4578 \u00f7 0.8.\n\nWell, 4578 \u00f7 0.8 is the same as 4578 multiplied by 10/8, which is 5/4. So 4578 * 1.25.\n\nCompute 4578 * 1.25.\n\n1.25 is 1 + 0.25. So compute 4578 *1 =4578, 4578 *0.25=1144.5.\n\nAdding together: 4578 + 1144.5 = 5722.5. So yes, that's correct.\n\nBut none of the options is 5722.5. Option B is 5723. Hmm. That's very close. Did I do something wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question says: \"What was the actual selling price of the article?\" Wait, but the article was sold at 20% discount. So the price Vinit paid, 4578, is the discounted price. The actual selling price would be the original price, which is higher. So my calculation was correct, P=5722.5, which is not an option. The closest is option B: 5723. But wait, the options are all integers, so perhaps I should check my calculation again.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me think: the discount is 20%, so the selling price is 80% of the original. So:\n\nSelling price = Original price \u00d7 0.8.\n\nSo, Original price = Selling price / 0.8.\n\nSo, 4578 / 0.8 = ?\n\nLet me compute 4578 \u00f7 0.8. Let me do this without fractions.\n\n0.8 is 8/10. So dividing by 8/10 is the same as multiplying by 10/8.\n\nSo, 4578 \u00d7 10 = 45780.\n\n45780 \u00f78.\n\nCompute 8 into 45780.\n\n8 \u00d75000 =40000. 45780-40000=5780.\n\n8\u00d7700=5600. 5780-5600=180.\n\n8\u00d722=176. 180-176=4.\n\nSo, 5000 + 700 +22 =5722, with a remainder of 4.\n\nSo 45780 \u00f78=5722.5.\n\nSo that's 5722.5. So the original price was Rs.5722.5.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So looking at the options, option B is 5723, which is the closest. But wait, perhaps the question is asking for the selling price before the discount, which would be the original price, but the options don't include 5722.5. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me read it again.\n\nQuestion: Vinit purchased an article for Rs.4578 in the sale. What was the actual selling price of the article?\n\nWait, the actual selling price would be the price before any discounts. But that doesn't make sense because the sale implies the discounted price. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the question is phrased in a way that I'm getting it wrong. Let me think: the actual selling price is the price after discount. But that's what Vinit paid, 4578. So maybe the question is asking for the original price before the discount. Because the options are higher than 4578, except for option E (4870) which is higher than 4578, but others are higher as well.\n\nWait, so the correct answer would be 5722.5, which is not in the options. Hmm. That can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question.\n\nWait, another possibility: maybe the question is asking for the selling price after the discount, but in the options, the correct one would be 4578. But that's not in the options. So that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, or I misread it. Let me read it again.\n\n\"In a sale, a discount of 20% was available on all the articles. If Vinit purchased an article for Rs.4578 in the sale. What was the actual selling price of the article?\"\n\nWait, perhaps the actual selling price refers to the original price. So the actual selling price (without discount) is the original price, which is higher than what Vinit paid. So the correct calculation is as I did earlier, which is 5722.5. But that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me recheck the calculation. 4578 \u00f70.8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute 4578 \u00d7 (5/4). Let's compute 4578 \u00d75 first. 4578 \u00d75.\n\n4578 \u00d75:\n\n8\u00d75=40 \u2192 0, carryover 4.\n\n7\u00d75=35 +4=39 \u2192 9, carryover 3.\n\n5\u00d75=25 +3=28 \u21928, carryover 2.\n\n4\u00d75=20 +2=22 \u21922, carryover 2.\n\nSo 4578 \u00d75 =22890.\n\nNow, divide 22890 by4.\n\n22890 \u00f74:\n\n4 into 22 is 5, 5\u00d74=20 \u2192 remainder 2.\n\nBring down 8: 28. 4 into 28 is 7 \u21927\u00d74=28, remainder 0.\n\nBring down 9: 9. 4 into 9 is 2 \u21922\u00d74=8, remainder 1.\n\nBring down 0: 10. 4 into10 is 2 \u21922\u00d74=8, remainder 2.\n\nBring down 0: 20. 4 into20 is5 \u21925\u00d74=20, remainder 0.\n\nSo the quotient is 5722.5.\n\nHmm. So 5722.5, which is not an option. But option B is 5723. That's very close. Maybe due to rounding, but 5722.5 is exactly between 5722 and 5723. So perhaps the correct answer is option B)5723.\n\nBut why isn't the exact value present? Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute 0.8 \u00d75723 and see if it equals 4578.\n\n0.8 \u00d75723 = ?\n\nLet me compute 5723 \u00d70.8.\n\n5723 \u00d70.8 = ?\n\n5000 \u00d70.8=4000.\n\n700 \u00d70.8=560.\n\n20 \u00d70.8=16.\n\n3 \u00d70.8=2.4.\n\nAdding them together: 4000 +560=4560; 4560+16=4576; 4576+2.4=4578.4.\n\nHmm, that's 4578.4, but Vinit paid 4578. So that's a bit off by 0.4. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 0.8 \u00d75722.5=4578, which matches exactly.\n\nSo 5722.5 is the exact original price. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct option is B)5723, which is the closest integer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the discount is 20%, and the selling price is 4578. So perhaps the question is the other way: what is the selling price after discount, which is 4578, but the options don't include that. So I'm confused.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the question is reversed. Maybe Vinit paid Rs.4578, which is the original price, and the selling price after discount is 4578. Then the actual selling price (the discounted price) would be less. But that doesn't fit the options because all options except E are higher.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the selling price before the discount, which would be higher than 4578. So the calculation is correct, but the options don't have the exact value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again.\n\nQuestion: What was the actual selling price of the article?\n\nHmm, perhaps the term \"actual selling price\" refers to the discounted price, which is what Vinit paid, 4578. But that can't be right because that's what he paid. So the question must be asking for the original price before discount.\n\nSo, the correct calculation is 5722.5, which is not an option. But the closest option is B)5723.\n\nWait, but the options include 5723 (option B) and 5040 (option C). Hmm. Maybe I should check if I have the correct approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the discount is 20% on the selling price, but that's not the usual way discounts are applied. Normally, discounts are on the marked price or original price. So the approach should be correct.\n\nWait, another angle: perhaps the problem is that the discount is 20% on the selling price, which is a different approach. But that's not the usual scenario. Let me try that.\n\nIf the discount is 20% on the selling price, then the selling price (Vinit's price) is 80% of the original. No, that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the discount is 20% on the cost price, but that doesn't change the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the selling price is the price after discount, and the actual selling price refers to the original price. So the correct calculation is 5722.5. Since this isn't an option, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is in the question's wording. Maybe \"actual selling price\" refers to the price without any discounts, which is the original price. So, perhaps the correct answer is 5722.5, which is not present. So, I'm stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased as what was the selling price before the discount. So, the correct answer would be 5722.5, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me recompute 4578 \u00f70.8.\n\n4578 \u00f7 0.8: \n\nLet me compute 4578 \u00f7 0.8.\n\nWell, 0.8 \u00d7 5000 =4000.\n\n0.8 \u00d7 700 =560 \u2192 4000+560=4560.\n\n4578-4560=18.\n\nSo 18 \u00f70.8 =22.5.\n\nSo total is 5000 +700 +22.5=5722.5.\n\nSo yes, that's correct.\n\nHmm, so the correct original price is 5722.5, which isn't an option. So perhaps the options have a typo, or I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, option B is 5723, which is just 0.5 more than 5722.5. So perhaps the correct answer is option B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question was asking for the selling price without the discount, which would be the same as the original price. So, the correct answer is 5722.5, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option B, 5723.\n\nSo, I'll go with option B)5723.\n",

So, when an article is sold at a discount, the selling price is the price after the discount. So, if the original price is P, and the discount is 20%, then the selling price is P minus 20% of P, which is P*(1 - 0.20) = P*0.80.\n\nIn this case, Vinit bought the article for Rs.4578, which is the selling price after the discount. So, 4578 = P * 0.80. Therefore, to find P, the original price, I need to divide 4578 by 0.80.\n\nLet me do that calculation. 4578 divided by 0.8. Hmm, what's 4578 \u00f7 0.8?\n\nLet me compute this step by step. Alternatively, I can think of 0.8 as 4/5. So dividing by 4/5 is the same as multiplying by 5/4. So 4578 * (5/4) = ?\n\nLet me compute 4578 * 5 first. 4578 * 5: 4000*5=20000, 500*5=2500, 70*5=350, 8*5=40. So adding them up: 20000 + 2500 is 22500, plus 350 is 22850, plus 40 is 22890.\n\nNow, divide that by 4: 22890 /4. Let me compute that. 4 into 22 is 5, 5*4=20, remainder 2. Bring down 8: 28. 4 into 28 is 7. 7*4=28, no remainder. Bring down 9: 9. 4 into 9 is 2, 2*4=8, remainder 1. Bring down 0: 10. 4 into 10 is 2, 2*4=8, remainder 2. Bring down the next 0 (since 22890 is 22890.000...). Wait, I'm not sure if I'm doing this correctly. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, 4 into 22 is 5, 5*4=20, remainder 2. So 22890 \u00f74: \n\nLet me compute it step by step:\n4 ) 22890\n\n- 4 into 2 is 0, but 4 into 22 is 5. 5*4=20. Subtract: 22-20=2.\nBring down the 8: 28.\n4 into 28 is 7. 7*4=28. Subtract: 0.\nBring down 9: 09.\n4 into 9 is 2. 2*4=8. Subtract: 1.\nBring down 0: 10.\n4 into 10 is 2. 2*4=8. Subtract: 2.\nBring down 0: 20.\n4 into 20 is 5. 5*4=20. Subtract: 0.\n\nSo putting it all together: 5,7,2,2,5. So 5722.5? Wait, no, that's not matching the options. Wait, the options are all integers. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate 4578 divided by 0.8.\n\nAlternatively, 0.8 is 4/5. So 4578 * (5/4) = ?\n\n4578 * 5 is 22890. Then divide by 4. 22890 \u00f74.\n\n22890 /4: 4*5000=20000. 22890-20000=2890. 4*700=2800. 2890-2800=90. 4*22=88. 90-88=2. So 5000 + 700 +22= 5722, with a remainder of 2. So 5722.5.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 5722.5. Looking at the options: A)5050, B)5723, C)5040, D)4950, E)4870.\n\nWait, option B is 5723. But my calculation gives 5722.5. Hmm. Close but not exact. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's compute 4578 divided by 0.8.\n\n4578 \u00f7 0.8.\n\nWell, 4578 \u00f7 0.8 is the same as 4578 multiplied by 10/8, which is 5/4. So 4578 * 1.25.\n\nCompute 4578 * 1.25.\n\n1.25 is 1 + 0.25. So compute 4578 *1 =4578, 4578 *0.25=1144.5.\n\nAdding together: 4578 + 1144.5 = 5722.5. So yes, that's correct.\n\nBut none of the options is 5722.5. Option B is 5723. Hmm. That's very close. Did I do something wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question says: \"What was the actual selling price of the article?\" Wait, but the article was sold at 20% discount. So the price Vinit paid, 4578, is the discounted price. The actual selling price would be the original price, which is higher. So my calculation was correct, P=5722.5, which is not an option. The closest is option B: 5723. But wait, the options are all integers, so perhaps I should check my calculation again.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me think: the discount is 20%, so the selling price is 80% of the original. So:\n\nSelling price = Original price \u00d7 0.8.\n\nSo, Original price = Selling price / 0.8.\n\nSo, 4578 / 0.8 = ?\n\nLet me compute 4578 \u00f7 0.8. Let me do this without fractions.\n\n0.8 is 8/10. So dividing by 8/10 is the same as multiplying by 10/8.\n\nSo, 4578 \u00d7 10 = 45780.\n\n45780 \u00f78.\n\nCompute 8 into 45780.\n\n8 \u00d75000 =40000. 45780-40000=5780.\n\n8\u00d7700=5600. 5780-5600=180.\n\n8\u00d722=176. 180-176=4.\n\nSo, 5000 + 700 +22 =5722, with a remainder of 4.\n\nSo 45780 \u00f78=5722.5.\n\nSo that's 5722.5. So the original price was Rs.5722.5.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So looking at the options, option B is 5723, which is the closest. But wait, perhaps the question is asking for the selling price before the discount, which would be the original price, but the options don't include 5722.5. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me read it again.\n\nQuestion: Vinit purchased an article for Rs.4578 in the sale. What was the actual selling price of the article?\n\nWait, the actual selling price would be the price before any discounts. But that doesn't make sense because the sale implies the discounted price. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the question is phrased in a way that I'm getting it wrong. Let me think: the actual selling price is the price after discount. But that's what Vinit paid, 4578. So maybe the question is asking for the original price before the discount. Because the options are higher than 4578, except for option E (4870) which is higher than 4578, but others are higher as well.\n\nWait, so the correct answer would be 5722.5, which is not in the options. Hmm. That can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question.\n\nWait, another possibility: maybe the question is asking for the selling price after the discount, but in the options, the correct one would be 4578. But that's not in the options. So that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, or I misread it. Let me read it again.\n\n\"In a sale, a discount of 20% was available on all the articles. If Vinit purchased an article for Rs.4578 in the sale. What was the actual selling price of the article?\"\n\nWait, perhaps the actual selling price refers to the original price. So the actual selling price (without discount) is the original price, which is higher than what Vinit paid. So the correct calculation is as I did earlier, which is 5722.5. But that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me recheck the calculation. 4578 \u00f70.8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute 4578 \u00d7 (5/4). Let's compute 4578 \u00d75 first. 4578 \u00d75.\n\n4578 \u00d75:\n\n8\u00d75=40 \u2192 0, carryover 4.\n\n7\u00d75=35 +4=39 \u2192 9, carryover 3.\n\n5\u00d75=25 +3=28 \u21928, carryover 2.\n\n4\u00d75=20 +2=22 \u21922, carryover 2.\n\nSo 4578 \u00d75 =22890.\n\nNow, divide 22890 by4.\n\n22890 \u00f74:\n\n4 into 22 is 5, 5\u00d74=20 \u2192 remainder 2.\n\nBring down 8: 28. 4 into 28 is 7 \u21927\u00d74=28, remainder 0.\n\nBring down 9: 9. 4 into 9 is 2 \u21922\u00d74=8, remainder 1.\n\nBring down 0: 10. 4 into10 is 2 \u21922\u00d74=8, remainder 2.\n\nBring down 0: 20. 4 into20 is5 \u21925\u00d74=20, remainder 0.\n\nSo the quotient is 5722.5.\n\nHmm. So 5722.5, which is not an option. But option B is 5723. That's very close. Maybe due to rounding, but 5722.5 is exactly between 5722 and 5723. So perhaps the correct answer is option B)5723.\n\nBut why isn't the exact value present? Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute 0.8 \u00d75723 and see if it equals 4578.\n\n0.8 \u00d75723 = ?\n\nLet me compute 5723 \u00d70.8.\n\n5723 \u00d70.8 = ?\n\n5000 \u00d70.8=4000.\n\n700 \u00d70.8=560.\n\n20 \u00d70.8=16.\n\n3 \u00d70.8=2.4.\n\nAdding them together: 4000 +560=4560; 4560+16=4576; 4576+2.4=4578.4.\n\nHmm, that's 4578.4, but Vinit paid 4578. So that's a bit off by 0.4. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 0.8 \u00d75722.5=4578, which matches exactly.\n\nSo 5722.5 is the exact original price. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct option is B)5723, which is the closest integer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the discount is 20%, and the selling price is 4578. So perhaps the question is the other way: what is the selling price after discount, which is 4578, but the options don't include that. So I'm confused.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the question is reversed. Maybe Vinit paid Rs.4578, which is the original price, and the selling price after discount is 4578. Then the actual selling price (the discounted price) would be less. But that doesn't fit the options because all options except E are higher.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the selling price before the discount, which would be higher than 4578. So the calculation is correct, but the options don't have the exact value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again.\n\nQuestion: What was the actual selling price of the article?\n\nHmm, perhaps the term \"actual selling price\" refers to the discounted price, which is what Vinit paid, 4578. But that can't be right because that's what he paid. So the question must be asking for the original price before discount.\n\nSo, the correct calculation is 5722.5, which is not an option. But the closest option is B)5723.\n\nWait, but the options include 5723 (option B) and 5040 (option C). Hmm. Maybe I should check if I have the correct approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the discount is 20% on the selling price, but that's not the usual way discounts are applied. Normally, discounts are on the marked price or original price. So the approach should be correct.\n\nWait, another angle: perhaps the problem is that the discount is 20% on the selling price, which is a different approach. But that's not the usual scenario. Let me try that.\n\nIf the discount is 20% on the selling price, then the selling price (Vinit's price) is 80% of the original. No, that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the discount is 20% on the cost price, but that doesn't change the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the selling price is the price after discount, and the actual selling price refers to the original price. So the correct calculation is 5722.5. Since this isn't an option, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is in the question's wording. Maybe \"actual selling price\" refers to the price without any discounts, which is the original price. So, perhaps the correct answer is 5722.5, which is not present. So, I'm stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased as what was the selling price before the discount. So, the correct answer would be 5722.5, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me recompute 4578 \u00f70.8.\n\n4578 \u00f7 0.8: \n\nLet me compute 4578 \u00f7 0.8.\n\nWell, 0.8 \u00d7 5000 =4000.\n\n0.8 \u00d7 700 =560 \u2192 4000+560=4560.\n\n4578-4560=18.\n\nSo 18 \u00f70.8 =22.5.\n\nSo total is 5000 +700 +22.5=5722.5.\n\nSo yes, that's correct.\n\nHmm, so the correct original price is 5722.5, which isn't an option. So perhaps the options have a typo, or I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, option B is 5723, which is just 0.5 more than 5722.5. So perhaps the correct answer is option B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question was asking for the selling price without the discount, which would be the same as the original price. So, the correct answer is 5722.5, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option B, 5723.\n\nSo, I'll go with option B)5723.\n\n\nThe problem involves calculating the original price of an article before a 20% discount was applied. Vinit purchased the article for Rs. 4578, which is the price after the discount. The relationship between the original price \\( P \\) and the discounted price \\( S \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nS = P \\times (1 - \\text{discount})\n\\]\n\nHere, the discount is 20%, so:\n\n\\[\nS = P \\times 0.8\n\\]\n\nRearranging to solve for \\( P \\):\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{S}{0.8}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( S = 4578 \\):\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{4578}{0.8}\n\\]\n\nPerforming the calculation:\n\n\\[\nP = 4578 \\div 0.8 = 5722.5\n\\]\n\nThe original price is Rs. 5722.5. However, none of the options exactly match this value. The closest option is **B) 5723**, which is just 0.5 more than the calculated value. Given the options, the intended answer is likely **B) 5723**.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nThe question says that in a sale, there's a discount of 20% available on all articles. Vinit bought an article for Rs.4578 during the sale. The question is asking what the actual selling price of the article was. The options are A to E, with various amounts.\n\nWait, wait a second. I'm a bit confused. If Vinit bought it for Rs.4578 during the sale, which had a 20% discount, does that mean that Rs.4578 is the discounted price? Because the sale is offering 20% off, so the selling price would be lower than the original price. So the Rs.4578 is after the discount, and we need to find the original price, which would be the actual selling price before the discount, or wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, no, no. No, in a sale, when you apply a discount, the selling price is lower than the marked price. So the actual selling price is the price after the discount. But the way the question is phrased is a bit tricky. Let me parse it again.\n\nWait, the question says: \"the actual selling price of the article.\" Hmm. Oh, wait, maybe I got it wrong. So perhaps the Rs.4578 is the selling price after the discount, and we're to find the original price, which would be the actual selling price without the discount. Because when they say 'actual selling price', they might mean the price before the discount was applied. Or maybe not. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The scenario is a sale where a 20% discount is given. So, the marked price is the original price, and the selling price is after applying the discount. So if someone buys an article for Rs.4578, that's the discounted price. So to find the original price, we can calculate it.\n\nSo, let's denote the original price as the actual selling price, which is the price before the discount. Then, the discounted price is 80% of the original because 20% is taken off. So, the equation would be:\n\nDiscounted Price = Original Price \u00d7 (100% - Discount%)\n\nSo, 4578 = Original Price \u00d7 0.8\n\nSo, to find the Original Price, we can rearrange that:\n\nOriginal Price = 4578 / 0.8\n\nLet me calculate that. 4578 divided by 0.8. Hmm, 0.8 is the same as 4/5, so dividing by 0.8 is the same as multiplying by 5/4. Let me do that.\n\n4578 multiplied by 5 is 22,890. Then divided by 4. Let me compute that: 22,890 \u00f7 4. 4 into 22 is 5, 5\u00d74=20, remainder 2. Bring down 8: 28. 4 into 28 is 7, 7\u00d74=28. Bring down 9: 4 into 9 is 2, 2\u00d74=8, remainder 1. Bring down 0: 10. 4 into 10 is 2, 2\u00d74=8, remainder 2. Bring down 0: 20. 4 into 20 is 5, 5\u00d74=20. So putting it together, 5722.5? Wait, wait, no, wait, wait. Let me do this more carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps I should just compute 4578 \u00f7 0.8.\n\n0.8 \u00d7 5000 is 4000. 0.8 \u00d7 5722.5 is 4578 because 0.8 \u00d7 5722.5 = 5722.5 \u00d7 0.8. Let me compute 5722.5 \u00d7 0.8:\n\n5722 \u00d7 0.8 is (5000 \u00d70.8) + (722\u00d70.8) = 4000 + 577.6 = 4577.6. Then, 0.5 \u00d70.8 is 0.4. So 4577.6 + 0.4 = 4578. So yes, 5722.5 is correct.\n\nWait, but the options are in whole numbers. Hmm, looking at the options, option B is 5723, which is close to 5722.5. But wait, that can't be, because 20% discount should result in an exact amount. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me check my calculation again. Let me compute 4578 divided by 0.8.\n\n4578 \u00f7 0.8 = ?\n\nWell, 4578 multiplied by 10 is 45780. Divided by 8 (because 0.8 is 8/10, so dividing by 0.8 is same as 10/8 = 5/4, but perhaps I should compute 45780 \u00f78.\n\nLet me compute 45780 \u00f78.\n\n8 \u00d7 5000 is 40,000. 45780 -40000=5780.\n\n8 \u00d7 700=5600. So 5000+700=5700, which gives 40,000 + 5600=45600. Subtract from 45780: 45780 -45600=180.\n\n8 \u00d722=176, so 22 more gives 176, leaving 4. 4/8 is 0.5.\n\nSo total is 5700+22=5722, and 4/8=0.5. So 5722.5.\n\nSo the original price is 5722.5. But the options don't have a decimal. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is the other way around. Maybe the Rs.4578 is the actual selling price, and the discounted price is what Vinit paid, which would be less than 4578? That doesn't make sense because the discount is applied on all articles, so the price after discount would be lower. But the way the question is phrased is confusing.\n\nWait, let me read the question again. It says, \"Vinit purchased an article for Rs.4578 in the sale.\" So the sale price is Rs.4578. So that's the discounted price. So the original price is higher than that. So the actual selling price before discount would be the original price, which is the actual price, and the discounted price is what Vinit paid.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"the actual selling price of the article.\" Hmm. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting confused between the terms. Let me clarify: In a sale, the marked price is the original price, and the selling price is the price after discount. So if the article was sold for Rs.4578 after a 20% discount, then the original price (actual selling price without discount) is higher. So the actual selling price is the original price, which would be higher than 4578. So the correct calculation is 4578 is 80% of the original price. So original price is 4578 / 0.8 = 5722.5.\n\nBut the options don't have 5722.5. The closest is option B) 5723. So perhaps that's the intended answer.\n\nWait, but let me check if I perhaps inverted the calculation. What if the Rs.4578 is the original price, and the discounted price is what Vinit paid? Then the discounted price would be 80% of 4578. Let me compute that.\n\n0.8 \u00d74578 = ?\n\n4578 \u00d7 0.8: 4000\u00d70.8=3200, 500\u00d70.8=400, 78\u00d70.8=62.4. So 3200+400=3600 +62.4=3662.4. So the discounted price would be 3662.4. But that doesn't match any of the options given. So that scenario is not the case.\n\nSo the correct scenario is that 4578 is the discounted price, and the original price is 5722.5. So the answer must be option B) 5723.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option C is 5040. Hmm, perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me recalculate 4578 divided by 0.8.\n\nAnother approach: 0.8 \u00d7 X = 4578 \u2192 X = 4578 / 0.8.\n\n4578 divided by 0.8:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 10: 45780 /8.\n\nCompute 45780 \u00f78.\n\n8 \u00d75000=40000. 45780-40000=5780.\n\n8 \u00d7700=5600. 5780-5600=180.\n\n8 \u00d722=176. 180-176=4.\n\nSo 5000 +700 +22 =5722, and 4/8=0.5. So 5722.5.\n\nSo the original price is 5722.5, which is 5722.50. But the options are all integers. So perhaps the problem expects us to round to the nearest rupee, making it 5723, which is option B.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. Option B is 5723, which matches. So the correct answer should be B.\n",

So the Rs.4578 is after the discount, and we need to find the original price, which would be the actual selling price before the discount, or wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, no, no. No, in a sale, when you apply a discount, the selling price is lower than the marked price. So the actual selling price is the price after the discount. But the way the question is phrased is a bit tricky. Let me parse it again.\n\nWait, the question says: \"the actual selling price of the article.\" Hmm. Oh, wait, maybe I got it wrong. So perhaps the Rs.4578 is the selling price after the discount, and we're to find the original price, which would be the actual selling price without the discount. Because when they say 'actual selling price', they might mean the price before the discount was applied. Or maybe not. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The scenario is a sale where a 20% discount is given. So, the marked price is the original price, and the selling price is after applying the discount. So if someone buys an article for Rs.4578, that's the discounted price. So to find the original price, we can calculate it.\n\nSo, let's denote the original price as the actual selling price, which is the price before the discount. Then, the discounted price is 80% of the original because 20% is taken off. So, the equation would be:\n\nDiscounted Price = Original Price \u00d7 (100% - Discount%)\n\nSo, 4578 = Original Price \u00d7 0.8\n\nSo, to find the Original Price, we can rearrange that:\n\nOriginal Price = 4578 / 0.8\n\nLet me calculate that. 4578 divided by 0.8. Hmm, 0.8 is the same as 4/5, so dividing by 0.8 is the same as multiplying by 5/4. Let me do that.\n\n4578 multiplied by 5 is 22,890. Then divided by 4. Let me compute that: 22,890 \u00f7 4. 4 into 22 is 5, 5\u00d74=20, remainder 2. Bring down 8: 28. 4 into 28 is 7, 7\u00d74=28. Bring down 9: 4 into 9 is 2, 2\u00d74=8, remainder 1. Bring down 0: 10. 4 into 10 is 2, 2\u00d74=8, remainder 2. Bring down 0: 20. 4 into 20 is 5, 5\u00d74=20. So putting it together, 5722.5? Wait, wait, no, wait, wait. Let me do this more carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps I should just compute 4578 \u00f7 0.8.\n\n0.8 \u00d7 5000 is 4000. 0.8 \u00d7 5722.5 is 4578 because 0.8 \u00d7 5722.5 = 5722.5 \u00d7 0.8. Let me compute 5722.5 \u00d7 0.8:\n\n5722 \u00d7 0.8 is (5000 \u00d70.8) + (722\u00d70.8) = 4000 + 577.6 = 4577.6. Then, 0.5 \u00d70.8 is 0.4. So 4577.6 + 0.4 = 4578. So yes, 5722.5 is correct.\n\nWait, but the options are in whole numbers. Hmm, looking at the options, option B is 5723, which is close to 5722.5. But wait, that can't be, because 20% discount should result in an exact amount. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me check my calculation again. Let me compute 4578 divided by 0.8.\n\n4578 \u00f7 0.8 = ?\n\nWell, 4578 multiplied by 10 is 45780. Divided by 8 (because 0.8 is 8/10, so dividing by 0.8 is same as 10/8 = 5/4, but perhaps I should compute 45780 \u00f78.\n\nLet me compute 45780 \u00f78.\n\n8 \u00d7 5000 is 40,000. 45780 -40000=5780.\n\n8 \u00d7 700=5600. So 5000+700=5700, which gives 40,000 + 5600=45600. Subtract from 45780: 45780 -45600=180.\n\n8 \u00d722=176, so 22 more gives 176, leaving 4. 4/8 is 0.5.\n\nSo total is 5700+22=5722, and 4/8=0.5. So 5722.5.\n\nSo the original price is 5722.5. But the options don't have a decimal. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is the other way around. Maybe the Rs.4578 is the actual selling price, and the discounted price is what Vinit paid, which would be less than 4578? That doesn't make sense because the discount is applied on all articles, so the price after discount would be lower. But the way the question is phrased is confusing.\n\nWait, let me read the question again. It says, \"Vinit purchased an article for Rs.4578 in the sale.\" So the sale price is Rs.4578. So that's the discounted price. So the original price is higher than that. So the actual selling price before discount would be the original price, which is the actual price, and the discounted price is what Vinit paid.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"the actual selling price of the article.\" Hmm. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting confused between the terms. Let me clarify: In a sale, the marked price is the original price, and the selling price is the price after discount. So if the article was sold for Rs.4578 after a 20% discount, then the original price (actual selling price without discount) is higher. So the actual selling price is the original price, which would be higher than 4578. So the correct calculation is 4578 is 80% of the original price. So original price is 4578 / 0.8 = 5722.5.\n\nBut the options don't have 5722.5. The closest is option B) 5723. So perhaps that's the intended answer.\n\nWait, but let me check if I perhaps inverted the calculation. What if the Rs.4578 is the original price, and the discounted price is what Vinit paid? Then the discounted price would be 80% of 4578. Let me compute that.\n\n0.8 \u00d74578 = ?\n\n4578 \u00d7 0.8: 4000\u00d70.8=3200, 500\u00d70.8=400, 78\u00d70.8=62.4. So 3200+400=3600 +62.4=3662.4. So the discounted price would be 3662.4. But that doesn't match any of the options given. So that scenario is not the case.\n\nSo the correct scenario is that 4578 is the discounted price, and the original price is 5722.5. So the answer must be option B) 5723.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option C is 5040. Hmm, perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me recalculate 4578 divided by 0.8.\n\nAnother approach: 0.8 \u00d7 X = 4578 \u2192 X = 4578 / 0.8.\n\n4578 divided by 0.8:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 10: 45780 /8.\n\nCompute 45780 \u00f78.\n\n8 \u00d75000=40000. 45780-40000=5780.\n\n8 \u00d7700=5600. 5780-5600=180.\n\n8 \u00d722=176. 180-176=4.\n\nSo 5000 +700 +22 =5722, and 4/8=0.5. So 5722.5.\n\nSo the original price is 5722.5, which is 5722.50. But the options are all integers. So perhaps the problem expects us to round to the nearest rupee, making it 5723, which is option B.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. Option B is 5723, which matches. So the correct answer should be B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that Vinit purchased the article for Rs. 4578 during a sale where a 20% discount was applied. This means Rs. 4578 is the discounted price, and we need to find the original price (actual selling price before the discount). \n\nThe relationship between the discounted price and the original price is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Discounted Price} = \\text{Original Price} \\times (1 - \\text{Discount})\n\\]\n\nSince the discount is 20%, the discounted price is 80% of the original price:\n\n\\[\n4578 = \\text{Original Price} \\times 0.8\n\\]\n\nTo find the original price, we rearrange the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Original Price} = \\frac{4578}{0.8}\n\\]\n\nPerforming the division:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Original Price} = \\frac{4578}{0.8} = 5722.5\n\\]\n\nSince the options are in whole numbers, we round 5722.5 to the nearest integer, which is 5723. Comparing this with the options, the correct answer is:\n\n**Option B: 5723**\n\nAnswer: B",

Vinit bought an article for Rs.4578 during the sale. The question is asking for the actual selling price of the article. Wait, wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, I think I might be getting confused. Because if the discount is 20%, then the price Vinit paid is after the discount. So the actual selling price must have been higher before the discount, right? Because when you take a discount off the original price, the price you pay is lower.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The actual selling price before the discount, or is it the original price? Oh, right, the problem says the discount was on all articles. So the actual selling price must be the original price. Because the discounted price is what Vinit paid. So the Rs.4578 is after the 20% discount. So I need to find the original price, which is the actual selling price.\n\nSo, the way discounts work is that if you have a 20% discount, you pay 80% of the original price. Because 100% minus 20% is 80%. So, the formula I think I should use is: \n\nDiscounted Price = Original Price \u00d7 (100% - Discount%). \n\nIn this case, the Discounted Price is Rs.4578, and the discount is 20%, so 80% of the original price is Rs.4578.\n\nSo, mathematically, that's 4578 = Original Price \u00d7 0.80. \n\nTo find the Original Price, I can rearrange that equation. So, Original Price = 4578 / 0.80.\n\nLet me calculate that. Let's see, 4578 divided by 0.8. Hmm, 4578 divided by 0.8 is the same as 4578 multiplied by 10/8, which is 5/4, right? Because 0.8 is 4/5, so dividing by 4/5 is multiplying by 5/4.\n\nSo 4578 * (5/4) = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 4578 divided by 4 is 1144.5, and 1144.5 multiplied by 5 is 5722.5. Wait, that's 5722.5, but the options are in whole numbers.

But wait, why is the answer not an exact whole number? Did I make a mistake in the calculation?\n\nWait, let me recheck. 4578 divided by 0.8. Let me compute it step by step.\n\n4578 / 0.8:\n\n0.8 goes into 4578 how many times?\n\nAlternatively, 4578 divided by 0.8 is the same as 4578 multiplied by 1.25, because 1/0.8 is 1.25.\n\nSo, 4578 \u00d7 1.25.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n4578 \u00d7 1 = 4578.\n\n4578 \u00d7 0.25 is 4578 divided by 4, which is 1144.5.\n\nAdding them together: 4578 + 1144.5 = 5722.5.\n\nSo yeah, it's 5722.5. But since the options are in whole numbers, the closest one is 5723, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The original price must be such that when you take 20% off, you get 4578. So perhaps the original price is a number that is exactly divisible by 5, because 20% is 1/5. Let's see:\n\nIf the original price is O, then O \u00d7 0.8 = 4578 \u2192 O = 4578 / 0.8.\n\nWait, 4578 divided by 0.8 is 5722.5. So, the original price is 5722.5, which is Rs.5722.50. But the options don't have a 5722.5, but option B is 5723. So that must be the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is phrased in a way that I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the actual selling price is the price before the discount, which would be higher than the price Vinit paid. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nWait, wait, another approach. Suppose the original price is S. Then after a 20% discount, the price becomes S - 0.2 S = 0.8 S. So 0.8 S = 4578 \u2192 S = 4578 / 0.8 = 5722.5.\n\nSo the original selling price is 5722.5, which is not an option. But the options are given in integers. So perhaps the question is expecting us to round it to the nearest whole number. 5722.5 rounds up to 5723, which is option B. So I think that's the right answer.\n\nLet me check the other options. Option A is 5050. Let's see what happens if I take 20% off 5050. 20% of 5050 is 1010, so 5050 - 1010 = 4040, which is not 4578. So that's not correct.\n\nOption C is 5040. 20% of 5040 is 1008. So 5040 - 1008 is 4032. Not matching.\n\nOption D is 4950. 20% is 990. 4950 - 990 = 3960. Not 4578.\n\nOption E is 4870. 20% is 974. 4870-974=3900-something. No.\n\nSo the only one that comes close is option B, 5723. Because 5722.5 is essentially 5723 when rounded to the nearest integer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a sale where there's a 20% discount on all articles. Vinit bought an article for Rs.4578, and the question is asking what the actual selling price was. Hmm, wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, wait. Oh right, in sales, the discount is given on the original price. So the selling price is the original price minus the discount. So if Vinit bought it for 4578 after a 20% discount, that means 4578 is the price after the discount. So the original price must be higher than that.\n\nLet me get this straight. The discount is 20%, so the customer pays 80% of the original price. So if I let the original price be X, then 80% of X is equal to 4578. So the equation would be 0.8 * X = 4578. Then to find X, I can divide 4578 by 0.8.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up the terms. The question says the actual selling price. Oh wait, no, the actual selling price would be the original price. Because the discounted price is what Vinit paid. So the actual selling price is the original price before discount.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. No, the selling price is what the customer pays, which is after discount. So if the article was sold for 4578 after a 20% discount, that's the selling price. But the question is asking for the actual selling price. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because the selling price is already what was paid. Maybe the question is phrased incorrectly.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the original price, not the actual selling price. Because if the discount is applied, the selling price is the discounted amount. So maybe the question is asking for the original price.\n\nWait, let me read the question again. It says, \"What was the actual selling price of the article?\" Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Because if Vinit bought it for 4578 during the sale, that's the selling price. Unless I'm misunderstanding the terms.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased in a way that the actual selling price refers to the price before the discount. Because in a sale, the discounted price is the price the customer pays. So the actual (original) selling price would be the price before discount.\n\nSo, the problem is asking for the original price, which is higher. So how do I calculate that?\n\nThe formula is:\n\nSelling Price = Original Price - Discount\n\nBut since the discount is 20%, the selling price is 80% of the original price.\n\nSo, Selling Price = Original Price \u00d7 (1 - 0.20) = Original Price \u00d7 0.80\n\nWe know the Selling Price (after discount) is 4578. So,\n\n4578 = Original Price \u00d7 0.80\n\nTherefore, Original Price = 4578 / 0.80\n\nLet me calculate that. 4578 divided by 0.8.\n\nHmm, 0.8 is the same as 4/5. So dividing by 0.8 is the same as multiplying by 5/4.\n\nSo 4578 \u00d7 (5/4) = ?\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, 4578 divided by 4 is 1144.5. Then multiply by 5: 1144.5 \u00d75.\n\n1144 *5 is 5720, and 0.5 *5 is 2.5. So total is 5722.5. Wait, but wait: 4578 \u00f74:\n\n4 \u00d7 1144 = 4576, so 4578 is 4576 +2. So 4578 \u00f74 = 1144.5. Then 1144.5 \u00d75: 1144 *5 is 5720, plus 0.5 *5 is 2.5. So 5720 +2.5 = 5722.5.\n\nWait, but none of the options are 5722.5. The options are:\n\nA)5050\n\nB)5723\n\nC)5040\n\nD)4950\n\nE)4870\n\nHmm, option B is 5723, which is very close to 5722.5. So perhaps that's the intended answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternative way: 4578 \u00f7 0.8.\n\n4578 \u00d7 (10/8) = 4578 \u00d7 (5/4) = same as before.\n\nWait, 4578 \u00d75 is 22890, then divided by 4: 22890 \u00f74.\n\n22890 \u00f74: 4 \u00d7 5722 is 22888, so 22890 -22888=2, so 5722.5.\n\nSo yes, 5722.5, which is 5722.50. So when rounded to the nearest integer, it's 5723, which is option B.\n\nWait, but why is the question asking for the actual selling price? Because the 4578 is the price after the discount. The actual selling price before discount would be the original price. So perhaps the question is correct, and the answer is 5723.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased wrong, and the intended question is to find the original price, which is 5722.5, rounded to 5723.\n\nSo the correct answer is option B, 5723.\n",

Vinit bought an article for Rs.4578, and the question is asking what the actual selling price was. Hmm, wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, wait. Oh right, in sales, the discount is given on the original price. So the selling price is the original price minus the discount. So if Vinit bought it for 4578 after a 20% discount, that means 4578 is the price after the discount. So the original price must be higher than that.\n\nLet me get this straight. The discount is 20%, so the customer pays 80% of the original price. So if I let the original price be X, then 80% of X is equal to 4578. So the equation would be 0.8 * X = 4578. Then to find X, I can divide 4578 by 0.8.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up the terms. The question says the actual selling price. Oh wait, no, the actual selling price would be the original price. Because the discounted price is what Vinit paid. So the actual selling price is the original price before discount.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. No, the selling price is what the customer pays, which is after discount. So if the article was sold for 4578 after a 20% discount, that's the selling price.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a discount sale. Let me try to understand what's being asked. The question says that there's a 20% discount on all articles during a sale. Vinit bought an article for Rs.4578. I need to find the actual selling price of the article. Wait, wait, that's a bit confusing. Oh wait, maybe I got it wrong. Because the selling price is what the customer pays, right? So if there's a discount, the selling price would be lower than the original price. So if Vinit paid Rs.4578, that's after the discount. So the actual selling price might be the original price, and we need to find what that was before the discount. Or wait, wait. No, perhaps I'm getting it backwards. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no. The problem says the discount is 20%, so the selling price after discount is what the customer pays. So if the customer paid Rs.4578, that's the selling price after a 20% discount. So the original price must have been higher. The question is asking for the actual selling price, which I think is the original price because the discounted price is what Vinit paid. Wait, but no, the actual selling price might be what the article was sold for, which would be the discounted price. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused with the terminology.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-read the question carefully. The question says, \"If Vinit purchased an article for Rs.4578 in the sale. What was the actual selling price of the article?\" Oh, wait. Wait a minute. So during the sale, the article was sold for Rs.4578, which is the discounted price. So the actual selling price might be the price before the discount, which would be the original price. So I need to find the original price, which is the actual selling price, before the discount.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding what \"actual selling price\" refers to. Because if the article was sold during the sale, then the selling price is Rs.4578. But perhaps the question is asking for the original price before the discount started. Or maybe the actual selling price is the discounted price, which is what the customer paid. I'm a bit confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased a bit differently. Let me think again. The discount is 20%, so the customer pays 80% of the original price. So the selling price (after discount) is 80% of the original. So if Vinit paid Rs.4578, that's 80% of the original price. So to find the original price, I need to calculate 4578 divided by 0.8, which is the same as multiplying by 5/4.\n\nLet me do the math. 4578 divided by 0.8. Let's compute that. Hmm, 0.8 is 4/5, so dividing by 4/5 is the same as multiplying by 5/4. So 4578 * (5/4). Let's compute that.\n\n4578 * 5 = let's see, 4000*5 is 20,000, 500*5=2500, 70*5=350, 8*5=40. So adding them up: 20000 + 2500 = 22500, +350 is 22850, +40 is 22890. Then divide by 4. 22890 /4 = let's calculate. 4 into 22 is 5, 5*4=20, remainder 2. Bring down 8: 28. 4 into 28 is 7. 7*4=28, remainder 0. Bring down 9: 09. 4 into 9 is 2, 2*4=8, remainder 1. Bring down 0: 10. 4 into 10 is 2, 2*4=8, remainder 2. So the number is 5722.5. Wait, but all the options are whole numbers. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, let me compute 4578 * 5 = 22890. Then 22890 /4 = 5722.5. But the options don't have 5722.5. The options are A)5050, B)5723, C)5040, D)4950, E)4870. Hmm, option B is 5723, which is close. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate it another way. Let's compute 4578 / 0.8. Alternatively, 4578 multiplied by 1.25 (since 1/0.8 is 1.25). Let me compute 4578 * 1.25. 1.25 is the same as 5/4, so yes, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 4578 * 1.25. Let's see: 4578 * 1 = 4578. 4578 * 0.25 is 4578 /4. Let's compute that: 4578 /4. 4 into 4 is 1, 4 into 5 is 1, remainder 1. 4 into 17 (1 carried over) is 4, 4*4=16, remainder 1. 4 into 18 (1 carried over) is 4, 4*4=16, remainder 2. 4 into 28 (2 carried over) is 7, 7*4=28, no remainder. So 4578 /4 is 1144.5. So adding 4578 and 1144.5 gives 5722.5. So that's the same as before.\n\nBut the options don't have a 5722.5. So perhaps I have a miscalculation, or maybe the question is asking something else. Wait, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again.\n\nThe question says, \"What was the actual selling price of the article?\" Wait, if the article was sold for Rs.4578 during the sale, which is after a 20% discount, then the actual selling price is the original price. So perhaps I should compute the original price, which would be Rs.5722.5, but since the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are approximate or maybe I'm supposed to round it. Let's see: 5722.5 is approximately 5723, which is option B. So maybe that's the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check the problem again. Wait, is the discount 20% off the original, so the selling price is 80% of the original. So original price = selling price / 0.8.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm using the correct formula. If the selling price after discount is Rs.4578, then original price (let's call it SP) is 4578 / 0.8.\n\nYes, that's correct. So 4578 / 0.8 = 5722.5. So the closest option is B)5723.\n\nBut looking at the options, option C is 5040, which is exactly 4578 * (5040/4578) but that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me check 5722.5 again.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute 4578 * 1.25. Let's see:\n\n4578 * 1.25. Let's compute 4578 * 1 = 4578.\n\n4578 * 0.25 is 1144.5.\n\nAdding them: 4578 + 1144.5 = 5722.5. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the original price is Rs.5722.5, which would round to Rs.5723, which is option B. But let's look at the options again.\n\nOption B is s.5723. So that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is phrased differently. Maybe the discount is 20% off the selling price, but that doesn't make much sense because the discount is applied to the original price. So I think the initial approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the actual selling price refers to the price before any discount. So yes, the original price is the actual selling price, and the discounted price is what was paid.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B, 5723.\n",

Let me check 5722.5 again.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute 4578 * 1.25. Let's see:\n\n4578 * 1.25. Let's compute 4578 * 1 = 4578.\n\n4578 * 0.25 is 1144.5.\n\nAdding them: 4578 + 1144.5 = 5722.5. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the original price is Rs.5722.5, which would round to Rs.5723, which is option B. But let's look at the options again.\n\nOption B is s.5723. So that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is phrased differently. Maybe the discount is 20% off the selling price, but that doesn't make much sense because the discount is applied to the original price. So I think the initial approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the actual selling price refers to the price before any discount. So yes, the original price is the actual selling price, and the discounted price is what was paid.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B, 5723.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the original selling price of the article before the 20% discount. The customer paid Rs. 4578, which is 80% of the original price (since a 20% discount was applied). \n\nThe relationship between the discounted price and the original price is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Discounted Price} = \\text{Original Price} \\times (1 - \\text{Discount})\n\\]\n\nHere, the discounted price is Rs. 4578, and the discount is 20%, so:\n\n\\[\n4578 = \\text{Original Price} \\times 0.8\n\\]\n\nTo find the original price, we divide the discounted price by 0.8:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Original Price} = \\frac{4578}{0.8}\n\\]\n\nPerforming the calculation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Original Price} = 4578 \\times 1.25 = 5722.5\n\\]\n\nSince the options provided are whole numbers, we round 5722.5 to the nearest whole number, which is 5723. Comparing this with the options, the closest match is **B) 5723**.\n\nThus, the original selling price of the article is Rs. 5723.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a sale where there's a 20% discount on all articles. Vinit bought an article for Rs.4578. The question is asking what the actual selling price was. Hmm, wait, I'm a bit confused. Because if it's a discount, then the selling price would be lower than the original price. Oh wait, wait. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says a discount of 20% was available. So the selling price is after the discount. So Vinit paid Rs.4578 after a 20% discount. So the question is, what was the actual selling price before the discount? No, wait, no. Wait, the actual selling price is the price after discount. Because the discount is on the original price. So the original price is higher, and the discounted price is what Vinit paid.\n\nWait, no. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me read the question again carefully. \"What was the actual selling price of the article?\" Oh wait, the actual selling price is the price after the discount. Because in sales, the discount is applied to the original price to get the selling price. So if Vinit bought it for Rs.4578, that's after the discount. So the actual selling price is 4578, but the original price is higher.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 4578 as one of them. So perhaps the question is phrased differently. Let me read the question again. Oh, wait, no. The options are A) 5050, B)5723, C)5040, D)4950, E)4870. So none of these is 4578. So that suggests that perhaps the Rs.4578 is the discounted price, and the actual selling price is the original price, which is higher. Or wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly. Let me read it again: \"What was the actual selling price of the article?\" Wait, the actual selling price is what the customer paid. So if the discount was applied, then the selling price is after the discount. So Vinit paid Rs.4578, which is the selling price after the discount. So the original price (or marked price) must be higher.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as, \"the actual selling price.\" Hmm, maybe the wording is a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the Rs.4578 is the price after the discount, so the original price is higher, and we need to find that.\n\nWait, let me think about the calculation. If the discount is 20%, that means the customer pays 80% of the original price. So if the selling price after discount is S, then S = Original Price * (100 - 20)% = Original Price * 80%, or 0.8 * Original Price.\n\nSo, if Vinit paid S = Rs.4578, then the original price would be S / 0.8. Let me calculate that. 4578 divided by 0.8.\n\nLet me do that: 4578 divided by 0.8. Let's see, 4578 / 0.8. Hmm. 0.8 is the same as 4/5, so dividing by 0.8 is the same as multiplying by 5/4. So 4578 * 5/4 = ?\n\n4578 * 5 = 22890. Then divide by 4: 22890 /4 = 5722.5. Wait, that's 5722.5. But looking at the options, option B is 5723, which is that number rounded up.\n\nWait, but the options have option B as 5723, which is very close. So the original price would be Rs.5722.5, which would round to 5723. So the answer would be option B.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the actual selling price. Wait, no. Wait, no, no, the actual selling price is the price after discount, which is 4578. But the original price is the higher one, which is 5722.5. So why is the question asking for the actual selling price?\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting the terms wrong. Oh wait, perhaps the question is phrased as \"the actual selling price\" is the original price before discount, but that doesn't make sense. Because the selling price is what you pay. So perhaps the question is actually asking for the original price, not the selling price.\n\nWait, let me read the question again: \"What was the actual selling price of the article?\" Hmm, perhaps the term \"actual selling price\" is referring to the price without the discount. So the discounted price is the selling price. So the actual selling price would be the price after discount. So in that case, the answer is 4578, but that's not among the options.\n\nWait, that can't be right. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe the question is actually asking for the original price, and the options are the possible original prices. Because 4578 is the discounted price.\n\nWait, but the question says, \"Vinit purchased an article for Rs.4578 in the sale.\" So that's the price he paid, which is after the discount. So the actual selling price (which is the same as the price he paid) is 4578. But that's not an option. So perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding it.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is in reverse. Maybe the Rs.4578 is the original price, and the actual selling price is after a 20% discount. But then the options are higher than 4578. No, that doesn't make sense because a 20% discount would lower the price.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the price before the discount, meaning the original price. Because the options are higher than 4578. So in that case, the calculation would be Original Price = 4578 / 0.8 = 5722.5, which is approximately 5723, option B.\n\nSo perhaps the question is asking for the original price, which is the actual price before the discount. So the answer is option B, 5723.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm getting confused because the term \"actual selling price\" is being used. Maybe the actual selling price is the original price, but that's not standard terminology.\n\nWait, in business terms, the selling price is what the customer pays. The original price or marked price is before any discounts. So in this case, the selling price after a 20% discount is 4578. So the original price would be higher.\n\nSo the calculation is as I did before, 4578 / 0.8 = 5722.5, which is 5723 when rounded.
