      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about calculating the maximum distance I can travel with $8.50 in a cab. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, let me read the problem again. The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile. Then, each additional quarter mile costs 10 cents. So, the initial fare is a bit steep, but after that, it's cheaper for each extra bit.\n\nWait, I need to find out how far I can go with $8.50. Hmm. Let me break this down. The total money I have is $8.50. The first part of the ride costs $3.50, so I should subtract that from the total to see how much is left for the additional distance.\n\nSo, subtracting 3.50 from 8.50 gives me 5.00. Oh, okay, so I have $5 left for the extra distance.\n\nEach additional quarter mile is 10 cents. So, how many quarter miles can I get with $5? Well, 10 cents is $0.10. So, I can divide 5 by 0.10 to find the number of quarter miles.\n\nCalculating that: 5 / 0.10 = 50. So, 50 quarter-miles.\n\nBut wait, each quarter mile is 0.25 miles. So, the total additional distance would be 50 * 0.25 miles.\n\nLet me compute that: 50 * 0.25 is 12.5 miles. So, the extra distance beyond the first quarter-mile is 12.5 miles.\n\nNow, adding the initial quarter mile: 0.25 + 12.5 = 12.75 miles. Wait, but wait a second. The first charge is for the first quarter-mile, so that's already included. So the total distance is the initial 0.25 plus the 12.5 from the extra quarters.\n\nSo 0.25 + 12.5 = 12.75 miles.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 12.75 miles. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations. Initial fare: $3.50 for 0.25 miles. Remaining money: $5. Each quarter mile after that is $0.10. So 5 / 0.10 = 50. 50 * 0.25 = 12.5. So total is 0.25 +12.5=12.75.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the answer should be B.\n",

I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of problems, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nFirst, the problem says the cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile. Then, it's 10 cents for each additional quarter mile. Hmm, so the initial charge covers up to a quarter mile, and beyond that, each extra quarter mile is 10 cents. My total money is $8.50, and I need to find out how far I can go.\n\nWait, let me get the units right. The first part is $3.50 for the first quarter mile. Then, each additional quarter mile is $0.10. So each extra quarter mile is 10 cents.\n\nSo, the plan is: subtract the initial charge from the total money, then see how many additional quarter miles I can afford with the remaining money. Then, calculate the total distance.\n\nLet me write down the steps.\n\nTotal money: $8.50.\n\nInitial charge: $3.50.\n\nSo, the remaining money after the initial charge is $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00.\n\nEach additional quarter mile is $0.10, so how many of those can I buy with $5.00?\n\nThat's $5.00 divided by $0.10 per quarter mile.\n\n$5.00 / $0.10 = 50. So that's 50 quarter miles.\n\nWait, wait. So, each quarter mile after the first one is 10 cents. So, 50 of them would add 50 * 0.25 miles.\n\nWait, no, wait. Each quarter mile is 0.25 miles. So 50 quarter miles is 50 * 0.25 = 12.5 miles. Plus the initial quarter mile, which is 0.25 miles. So total is 12.5 + 0.25 = 12.75 miles.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations.\n\nTotal money: $8.50.\n\nSubtract the initial charge: 8.50 - 3.50 = $5.00.\n\nEach additional quarter mile is $0.10. So, 5.00 / 0.10 = 50. So 50 quarter miles.\n\nBut wait, 50 quarter miles is 50 * 0.25 = 12.5 miles.\n\nSo the initial quarter is 0.25, so total is 12.5 + 0.25 = 12.75 miles. That's option B.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Oh no, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. The initial quarter is included in the $3.50, so after that, each additional quarter is 10 cents.\n\nSo, the first quarter is 0.25 miles for $3.50. Then, each additional 0.25 miles is 10 cents.\n\nSo, the total distance is 0.25 + (number of additional quarters)*0.25.\n\nSo, the number of additional quarters is how much?\n\nWe have $5.00 left, each quarter is $0.10. So, 5 / 0.10 = 50.\n\nSo, 50 additional quarters. Each is 0.25 miles, so 50 * 0.25 = 12.5.\n\nAdding the initial 0.25, total is 12.75 miles. So that's B.\n\nWait, but let me think about whether the initial $3.50 includes the first quarter, and then each additional quarter is 10 cents. So, that would be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model it as:\n\nTotal cost = 3.50 + 0.10 * (n), where n is the number of additional quarter miles.\n\nWait, no, because each additional quarter is 10 cents. So the total cost is 3.50 + 0.10 * n, where n is the number of additional quarter miles beyond the first.\n\nWait, but the first quarter is already included in the 3.50, so yes.\n\nSo, the total cost is 3.50 + 0.10 * n = 8.50.\n\nSo, 0.10 * n = 8.50 - 3.50 = 5.00.\n\nn = 5.00 / 0.10 = 50.\n\nSo, n is 50. So, the distance is 0.25 (first) + 50 * 0.25.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the first quarter is part of the 3.50, and each of the next n quarter miles is 10 cents. So, the distance is 0.25 + (n * 0.25).\n\nSo, n is 50. So, 0.25 + (50 * 0.25) = 0.25 + 12.5 = 12.75 miles. So that's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be B) 12.75 miles.\n\nBut let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA)11.75\nB)12.75\nC)17.75\nD)14.75\nE)10.75\n\nYes, B is 12.75, which matches our calculation.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Could I have any leftover money that allows me to cover a bit more? No, because 5.00 divided by 0.10 is exactly 50, so no cents left.\n\nSo, the calculation seems solid.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the maximum distance I can travel with $8.50 in a cab. Let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of problems, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nFirst, the problem says the cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile. Then, it's 10 cents for each additional quarter mile. Hmm, so the initial charge covers up to a quarter mile, and beyond that, each extra quarter mile is 10 cents. My total money is $8.50, and I need to find out how far I can go.\n\nWait, let me get the units right. The first part is $3.50 for the first quarter mile. Then, each additional quarter mile is $0.10. So each extra quarter mile is 10 cents.\n\nSo, the plan is: subtract the initial charge from the total money, then see how many additional quarter miles I can afford with the remaining money. Then, calculate the total distance.\n\nLet me write down the steps.\n\nTotal money: $8.50.\n\nInitial charge: $3.50.\n\nSo, the remaining money after the initial charge is $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00.\n\nEach additional quarter mile is $0.10, so how many of those can I buy with $5.00?\n\nThat's $5.00 divided by $0.10 per quarter mile.\n\n$5.00 / $0.10 = 50. So that's 50 quarter miles.\n\nWait, wait. So, each quarter mile after the first one is 10 cents. So, 50 of them would add 50 * 0.25 miles.\n\nWait, no, wait. Each quarter mile is 0.25 miles. So 50 quarter miles is 50 * 0.25 = 12.5 miles. Plus the initial quarter mile, which is 0.25 miles. So total is 12.5 + 0.25 = 12.75 miles.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations.\n\nTotal money: $8.50.\n\nSubtract the initial charge: 8.50 - 3.50 = $5.00.\n\nEach additional quarter mile is $0.10. So, 5.00 / 0.10 = 50. So 50 quarter miles.\n\nBut wait, 50 quarter miles is 50 * 0.25 = 12.5 miles.\n\nSo the initial quarter is 0.25, so total is 12.5 + 0.25 = 12.75 miles. That's option B.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Oh no, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. The initial quarter is included in the $3.50, so after that, each additional quarter is 10 cents.\n\nSo, the first quarter is 0.25 miles for $3.50. Then, each additional 0.25 miles is 10 cents.\n\nSo, the total distance is 0.25 + (number of additional quarters)*0.25.\n\nSo, the number of additional quarters is how much?\n\nWe have $5.00 left, each quarter is $0.10. So, 5 / 0.10 = 50.\n\nSo, 50 additional quarters. Each is 0.25 miles, so 50 * 0.25 = 12.5.\n\nAdding the initial 0.25, total is 12.75 miles. So that's B.\n\nWait, but let me think about whether the initial $3.50 includes the first quarter, and then each additional quarter is 10 cents. So, that would be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model it as:\n\nTotal cost = 3.50 + 0.10 * (n), where n is the number of additional quarter miles.\n\nWait, no, because each additional quarter is 10 cents. So the total cost is 3.50 + 0.10 * n, where n is the number of additional quarter miles beyond the first.\n\nWait, but the first quarter is already included in the 3.50, so yes.\n\nSo, the total cost is 3.50 + 0.10 * n = 8.50.\n\nSo, 0.10 * n = 8.50 - 3.50 = 5.00.\n\nn = 5.00 / 0.10 = 50.\n\nSo, n is 50. So, the distance is 0.25 (first) + 50 * 0.25.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the first quarter is part of the 3.50, and each of the next n quarter miles is 10 cents. So, the distance is 0.25 + (n * 0.25).\n\nSo, n is 50. So, 0.25 + (50 * 0.25) = 0.25 + 12.5 = 12.75 miles. So that's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be B) 12.75 miles.\n\nBut let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA)11.75\nB)12.75\nC)17.75\nD)14.75\nE)10.75\n\nYes, B is 12.75, which matches our calculation.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Could I have any leftover money that allows me to cover a bit more? No, because 5.00 divided by 0.10 is exactly 50, so no cents left.\n\nSo, the calculation seems solid. So the maximum distance is 12.75 miles.\n\n\nTo calculate the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 in a cab, the problem specifies that the cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and $0.10 for each additional quarter-mile.

The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and then 10 cents for each additional quarter mile. Hmm, let's see how I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the fare. The initial charge is $3.50, which covers the first quarter-mile. After that, each additional quarter-mile costs 10 cents. So I think the approach should be to find out how much money is left after the initial charge, then see how many additional quarter-miles I can afford with that.\n\nLet me jot down the given information. The total money I have is $8.50. The initial fare is $3.50. So the remaining money after that would be 8.50 minus 3.50. Let me do that calculation: 8.50 - 3.50 is 5.00 dollars left. So that's $5.00 to spend on additional quarter miles.\n\nEach additional quarter-mile is 10 cents, which is $0.10. So I need to find out how many times 0.10 goes into 5.00. To do that, I'll divide 5.00 by 0.10. 5 divided by 0.1 is 50. So that means I can go 50 additional quarter-miles.\n\nWait, wait. Because each 0.10 is a quarter-mile, so 50 quarter-miles would be 50 * 0.25 miles. Let me calculate that: 50 * 0.25 is 12.5 miles. So that's 12.5 miles from the additional charges.\n\nBut wait, the initial charge covers the first quarter-mile. So the total distance would be the initial 0.25 miles plus the 12.5 miles from the additional charges. Let me add those together: 0.25 + 12.5 equals 12.75 miles.\n\nHmm, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, initial is $3.50 for 0.25 miles. Then with $5 left, each 0.25 mile costs $0.10. So 5 / 0.10 is 50, which is 50 * 0.25 = 12.5.

The problem says $3.50 for the first quarter-mile, so that's exactly the first 0.25 miles. So the calculation should be correct.\n\nAnother way to approach it: The total fare is 3.50 + (n * 0.10), where n is the number of additional quarter-miles. The total fare can't exceed 8.50. So 3.50 + 0.10n \u2264 8.50. Subtract 3.50 from both sides: 0.10n \u2264 5.00. Then n \u2264 50. So 50 additional quarter-miles, which is 50 * 0.25 =12.5 miles.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out the maximum distance I can travel with $8.50 in a cab that charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the total amount of money I have, which is $8.50. The initial charge is $3.50 for the first quarter-mile. So, I should subtract that initial charge from the total amount to find out how much money is left for the additional distance. \n\nLet me do that subtraction: $8.50 minus $3.50 equals $5.00. So, I have $5.00 left to spend on the additional quarter miles.\n\nNow, each additional quarter-mile costs 10 cents. Wait, 10 cents is $0.10. I need to find out how many quarter-miles I can get with $5.00. To do that, I'll divide the remaining money by the cost per quarter-mile. \n\nSo, $5.00 divided by $0.10 per quarter-mile. Let me calculate that. 5 divided by 0.1 is 50. So that's 50 quarter-miles. \n\nWait a second, each quarter-mile is 0.25 miles. So, I need to convert the number of quarter-miles into actual miles. I have 50 quarter-miles, so multiply by 0.25. 50 times 0.25 is 12.5 miles. \n\nBut wait, that's only the additional distance beyond the first quarter-mile. Oh right, because the first quarter is already included in the initial $3.50 charge. So the total distance would be the first quarter-mile plus the additional 12.5 miles. \n\nWait, adding those together: 0.25 miles (from the first charge) plus 12.5 miles equals 12.75 miles total. So that's the maximum distance I can travel.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 12.75 miles. That must be the correct answer.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations. Initial cost is $3.50, leaving $5.00. Each 10 cents is 0.10, so $5.00 / 0.10 is 50. 50 * 0.25 is 12.5, plus the initial 0.25 gives 12.75. Yep, that adds up. So the answer should be B.\n\n\nTo determine the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 in a cab that charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and $0.10 for each additional quarter-mile, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Subtract the initial charge**: The first quarter-mile costs $3.50.

Let me read it again.\n\nThe question is about calculating the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 in a cab. The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and then 10 cents for each additional quarter mile. Hmm, right.\n\nAlright, so first, I need to break down how much money is spent on each part of the ride. The initial charge is $3.50 for the first quarter-mile. Then, every additional quarter-mile after that costs 10 cents. So, I guess I need to subtract the initial charge from the total amount to find out how much is left for the additional distance.\n\nSo, the total money is $8.50. Subtract the first part: $8.50 minus $3.50. Let me calculate that. 8.50 minus 3.50 is 5.00. Oh, so I have $5 left for the additional quarter miles.\n\nEach additional quarter mile is 10 cents, which is $0.10. So I need to figure out how many quarter-miles I can buy with $5.00. To find the number of quarter-miles, I divide $5.00 by $0.10. 5 divided by 0.1 is 50. So that's 50 quarter-miles.\n\nWait, but each of those is a quarter mile, right? So I need to convert that into miles. Since one quarter-mile is 0.25 miles, 50 quarter-miles would be 50 times 0.25. Let me compute that: 50 * 0.25 is 12.5 miles.\n\nBut wait, that's only the additional distance after the first quarter-mile. Oh right, the initial quarter-mile is included in the first charge. So the total distance is the initial quarter plus the additional 12.5 miles.\n\nWait a minute, wait. Let me make sure. The first quarter is part of the $3.50, so that's 0.25 miles. The rest is 50 * 0.25, which is 12.5 miles. So total distance is 0.25 + 12.5 = 12.75 miles. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is 12.75 miles. So that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I missed something. \n\nTotal money: $8.50. Subtract $3.50, gives $5.00. Each additional quarter mile is $0.10, so $5 / $0.10 = 50. So 50 quarter-miles. Each is 0.25, so 50 * 0.25 is 12.5 miles. Plus the initial 0.25 gives 12.75. Yep, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think in terms of total distance being the initial quarter plus the others. So the first part is 0.25 miles, and each 0.10 dollars gives 0.25 miles. So with $5, it's 50 * 0.25 = 12.5. So total is 12.75.\n\nLooking at the options, B is 12.75. So I'm confident that's the right answer.\n",
