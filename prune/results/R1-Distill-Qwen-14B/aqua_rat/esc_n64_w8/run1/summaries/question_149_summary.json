      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the percentage gain of a merchant who bought oranges and sold them. Hmm, let's see. I think I remember that percentage gain is basically the profit made over the cost price, right? So I need to find the profit first, then figure out what percentage that is of the cost.\n\nAlright, the merchant bought 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450. So the cost price per kg would be the total cost divided by the quantity. Let me calculate that. 450 divided by 90 is 5. Oh wait, so he bought each kg for Rs. 5.\n\nHe sold the whole lot at Rs. 7.50 per kg. So the selling price per kg is 7.50. Now, wait, how much did he sell all 90 kg for? That's the total selling price. So multiply 7.50 by 90. Let me do that. 7.5 times 90... 7 times 90 is 630, and 0.5 times 90 is 45. So 630 +45 is 675. So he sold them for Rs. 675 total.\n\nNow, the cost was 450, and he sold it for 675. So the profit is 675 minus 450. Let me subtract that. 675-450 is 225. So he made a profit of 225 Rs.\n\nTo find the percentage gain, I think it's (Profit / Cost Price) * 100. So that's (225 / 450) * 100. Let me calculate that. 225 divided by 450 is 0.5. Multiply by 100 gives 50%. So the percentage gain is 50%.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 50%, so that's the answer. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. \n\nCost per kg: 450/90=5. Correct. Selling per kg 7.5, so 90 kg is 90*7.5=675. Correct. Profit is 675-450=225. Yes. 225/450=0.5, which is 50%. So yes, the correct answer is A.\n",

I need to find the percentage gain. Hmm, percentage gain, which I think is the same as profit percentage. Right, so profit is selling price minus cost price, and then profit percentage is (profit / cost price) * 100.\n\nWait, let me make sure I have the right approach. So first, I should calculate the total cost price. He bought 90 kg for 450 rupees. So the cost per kg is 450 divided by 90. Let me do that: 450 \u00f7 90 is 5. So each kg cost him Rs. 5.\n\nThen he sold each kg at Rs. 7.50. So the selling price per kg is higher than the cost price per kg. The profit per kg would be selling price minus cost price. So 7.50 minus 5 is 2.50. So he makes a profit of Rs. 2.50 per kg.\n\nWait, but to find the total profit, I should multiply that per kg profit by the total number of kg, right? So 90 kg multiplied by 2.50. Let me calculate that. 90 times 2 is 180, and 90 times 0.5 is 45. So 180 +45 is 225.

Total selling price is 90 kg multiplied by 7.50. 90 times 7 is 630, and 90 times 0.5 is 45. So 630 +45 is 675. He sold it all for 675. He bought it for 450. So profit is 675 -450 which is 225. Yep, same result. So that's good.\n\nNow, percentage gain is (profit / cost price) * 100. So 225 divided by 450 equals 0.5. Multiply by 100 gives 50%.

So that's the correct answer.\n\n\nTo calculate the percentage gain, we first determine the total cost price and total selling price. The merchant purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450, so the cost price is Rs. 450. The selling price per kg is Rs. 7.50, so the total selling price for 90 kg is:\n\n\\[\n90 \\, \\text{kg} \\times 7.50 \\, \\text{Rs/kg} = 675 \\, \\text{Rs}.\n\\]\n\nThe profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Profit} = 675 \\, \\text{Rs} - 450 \\, \\text{Rs} = 225 \\, \\text{Rs}.\n\\]\n\nThe percentage gain is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Gain} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Profit}}{\\text{Cost Price}} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{225}{450} \\right) \\times 100 = 50\\%.\n\\]\n\nThus, the percentage gain is 50%, which corresponds to option A.\n\nAnswer: A",

Hmm, let me think through it step by step.\n\nAlright, the merchant bought 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450. So, first, I should figure out the cost price per kilogram. Oh wait, right, cost price is total cost divided by the quantity. So 450 divided by 90 kg. Let me do that: 450 \u00f7 90. Hmm, 90 times 5 is 450, so that's 5 Rs per kg. So the cost price (CP) is Rs 5 per kg.\n\nThen, the merchant sold the whole lot at Rs 7.50 per kg. So the selling price (SP) per kg is 7.50. Now, I need to find the gain percentage. Gain percentage is calculated based on the cost price, right? So the formula for percentage gain is (Profit / Cost Price) \u00d7 100%.\n\nWait, but wait, profit is selling price minus cost price, but that's per kg? Or is it total? Hmm, maybe I should calculate the total cost and total selling price to find the overall profit.\n\nLet me think again. The merchant bought 90 kg for 450 Rs. So total cost is 450 Rs. When he sells them, he sells all 90 kg at 7.50 per kg. So total selling price is 90 multiplied by 7.50. Let me calculate that: 90 * 7.50. Hmm, 90 times 7 is 630, and 90 times 0.5 is 45. So adding those together, 630 + 45 = 675. So total SP is 675 Rs.\n\nNow, the profit is SP minus CP. So 675 minus 450 equals 225 Rs. So the profit is 225 Rs.\n\nTo find the gain percentage, I use the formula: (Profit / CP) \u00d7 100%. So that's (225 / 450) \u00d7 100%. Let me compute that. 225 divided by 450 is 0.5. Multiply by 100% gives 50%. So the gain is 50%.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Another way: per kg, he buys at 5 Rs and sells at 7.50. So per kg profit is 2.50 Rs. For 90 kg, that's 2.5 *90 = 225, same as before. Then profit percentage is (2.5 /5 ) *100% = 50% same as before. So yes, 50% gain.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 50%.
