      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a money pouch. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the total amount is Rs. 700, and there are equal numbers of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins, and one rupee coins. Oh right, wait, one rupee is 100 paise. So I think I should convert everything into paise to make it easier.\n\nLet me denote the number of each coin as 'n'. So each type has 'n' coins. So the total amount from 25 paise coins would be 25 * n paise, from 50 paise it's 50 * n, and from one rupee coins, since each is 100 paise, it's 100 * n.\n\nWait, but adding all these together gives the total amount in paise. So total = 25n + 50n + 100n. Let me calculate that: 25+50 is 75, plus 100 is 175. So 175n paise. But the total is 700 rupees, which is 700 * 100 = 70,000 paise.\n\nSo the equation would be 175n = 70,000. To find n, I'll divide both sides by 175. Let's see, 70,000 divided by 175. Hmm, maybe I can simplify this division. \n\nLet me think: 175 times 400 is 70,000 because 175 * 400 = 70,000. So n must be 400. So each type of coin has 400 pieces. Wait, but the options don't have 400 as the answer. Let me check the options again. Oh, wait, option C is 400. So that's probably the answer. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. If each coin is 400, then 25p coins contribute 25 * 400 = 10,000 paise, which is 100 rupees. 50p coins: 50 * 400 = 20,000 paise, 200 rupees. One rupee coins: 100 * 400 = 40,000 paise, which is 400 rupees. Adding them all: 100 + 200 + 400 = 700. Yep, that adds up. So the answer is 400, which is option C.\n",

Oh, right, 100 paise make a rupee. So maybe I should convert everything to paise to make it easier.\n\nSo, each 25 paise coin is 0.25 rupees, 50 paise is 0.5, and 1 rupee is obviously 1.

I need to figure out how many of each type there are. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the problem. The total amount is 700 rupees, and each type of coin has the same number of coins. So, if I let the number of each coin be 'x', then there are x 25 paise coins, x 50 paise coins, and x 1 rupee coins.\n\nWait, but the coins are in different denominations. So I need to convert all of them into the same unit, probably paise, to make it easier. Because 1 rupee is 100 paise. So 25 paise is 0.25 rupees, but maybe working in paise is better.\n\nSo, each 25 paise coin is worth 25 p, each 50 paise is 50 p, and each 1 rupee is 100 p. So, if I have x of each, the total value would be:\n\nTotal = (25 * x) + (50 * x) + (100 * x) paise.\n\nLet me compute that. 25x + 50x is 75x, plus 100x makes 175x paise. Oh wait, because 25+50+100 is 175. So the total in paise is 175x.\n\nBut the total in the pouch is 700 rupees. Since 1 rupee is 100 paise, 700 rupees is 700 * 100 = 70,000 paise.\n\nSo, 175x = 70,000 paise.\n\nTo find x, I can divide both sides by 175.\n\nx = 70,000 / 175.\n\nLet me do that division. Hmm, 70,000 divided by 175. Let me see, 175 times 400 is 70,000 because 175*4=700, so 175*400=70,000. So x equals 400.\n\nWait, so each type of coin is 400. Let me check the options. Option C is 400, so that would be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 400 coins of 25 paise each: 400 *25=10,000 paise, which is 100 rupees. 400 coins of 50 p: 400*50=20,000 p, which is 200 rupees. 400 coins of 1 rupee: 400*100=40,000 p, which is 400 rupees. Adding all together: 100+200+400=700 rupees. Yep, that adds up correctly.\n\nSo the correct answer should be 400, which is option C.\n",

Inside, there are equal numbers of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins, and one rupee coins. I need to find out how many of each type there are. The options are given as A to E, and I have to choose the correct one.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. First, I should probably convert everything into the same unit to make calculations easier. Since the total is given in rupees, and the coins are in paise, I'll convert the coins to rupees. I remember that 100 paise make a rupee.\n\nSo, 25 paise is 0.25 rupees, 50 paise is 0.50 rupees, and one rupee is obviously 1.00 rupee.\n\nThe problem says there are equal numbers of each coin. Let's denote the number of each type of coin as 'n'. So, there are 'n' 25 paise coins, 'n' 50 paise coins, and 'n' one rupee coins.\n\nNow, the total amount from each type would be:\n\n- 25 paise coins contribute 0.25 * n rupees.\n- 50 paise coins contribute 0.50 * n rupees.\n- One rupee coins contribute 1.00 * n rupees.\n\nThe sum of these should equal 700 rupees. So, the equation would be:\n\n0.25n + 0.50n + 1.00n = 700\n\nLet me add those up. 0.25 + 0.50 is 0.75, plus 1.00 makes 1.75. So the equation is 1.75n = 700.\n\nTo find 'n', I can divide both sides by 1.75. So, n = 700 / 1.75.\n\nHmm, calculating that. 1.75 is the same as 7/4, so dividing by 7/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/7. So 700 * (4/7). Let me compute 700 divided by 7 first. 700 \u00f77 is 100. Then multiply by 4 gives 400. So, n is 400.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option C is 400. But wait, the question asks how many of each are there, so each type is 400 coins. So the total number of coins is 3 * 400 = 1200, but the options don't list that. Oh wait, the options are each for the number of each coin, not the total. So each would be 400, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when I think in terms of paise, it's easier. Maybe I should have worked in paise to avoid decimals.\n\nLet's try that approach. The total is 700 rupees, which is 700 * 100 = 70,000 paise.\n\nEach 25 paise coin contributes 25 p, 50 paise is 50 p, and one rupee is 100 p. \n\nSo, if there are 'n' of each, the total in paise is:\n\n25n + 50n + 100n = 70,000 paise.\n\nAdding those up: 25 +50=75, plus 100 is 175. So 175n =70,000.\n\nThen n =70,000 /175. Let's compute that.\n\nHmm, 175 * 400 is 70,000 because 175 * 400 = (175 * 4)*100 = 700*100=70,000. So yeah, n=400.\n\nSo each type has 400 coins.

There are equal numbers of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins, and one rupee coins. How many of each are there?\n\nHmm, right. So the key points are that the total amount is 700 rupees, and the number of each type of coin is the same. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the denominations. 25 paise, 50 paise, and 1 rupee. Wait, I remember that 1 rupee is 100 paise. So each 25 paise coin is a quarter of a rupee, 50 paise is half, and 1 rupee is, well, a full rupee.\n\nLet me denote the number of each type of coin as 'n'. So there are 'n' 25 paise coins, 'n' 50 paise coins, and 'n' 1 rupee coins.\n\nNow, to find the total amount contributed by each type of coin.\n\n25 paise coins: Each is worth 0.25 rupees. So 'n' coins would be 0.25 * n rupees.\n50 paise coins: Each is 0.50 rupees. So 'n' coins give 0.50 * n.\n1 rupee coins: Each is 1 rupee. So 'n' coins give 1 * n = n rupees.\n\nAdding all these together gives the total amount, which is 700 rupees.\n\nSo the equation is:\n0.25n + 0.50n + n = 700\n\nLet me compute the left side. 0.25 + 0.50 is 0.75, plus 1 is 1.75. So 1.75n = 700.\n\nTo find n, I can divide both sides by 1.75.\n\nn = 700 / 1.75\n\nHmm, let's calculate that. 700 divided by 1.75.\n\nWait, I can think of 1.75 as 7/4. So dividing by 7/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/7.\n\nSo 700 * (4/7) = (700/7) *4 = 100 *4 = 400.\n\nSo n is 400. That means there are 400 coins of each type.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 400. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations. Another way to compute 700 / 1.75.\n\n1.75 times what equals 700. Let's see:\n\n1.75 * 400 = 700 because 1.75 * 400 is 700. Because 1.75 * 100 is 175, so 175 *4 is 700. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo yes, the number of each coin is 400. So the correct answer is C.\n",

Hmm, I need to find out how many of each coin there are. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out what the variables are. Let's say the number of each type of coin is the same. So if I let x be the number of 25 paise coins, then the number of 50 paise coins is also x, and the number of one rupee coins is x as well. That makes sense because the problem states they're equal in number.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the total amount contributed by each type of coin. Let me break it down:\n\n- 25 paise coins: Each is worth 0.25 rupees. So if there are x of them, their total value is 0.25 * x.\n- 50 paise coins: Each is 0.50 rupees. So total is 0.50 * x.\n- One rupee coins: Each is 1 rupee, so total is 1 * x.\n\nAdding all these together should give me the total amount in the pouch, which is 700 rupees. So the equation would be:\n\n0.25x + 0.50x + x = 700.\n\nWait, let me write that again to make sure I got the decimals right. 25 paise is a quarter of a rupee, which is 0.25. 50 paise is half, so 0.50.

Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in setting up the equation. Did I convert everything correctly into rupees?\n\nYes, because 25 paise is 0.25 rupees, 50 is 0.50, and one is 1. So the equation is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about this: perhaps I can represent all the coins in paise to avoid dealing with decimals. So 25 paise coins contribute 25x paise, 50 paise contribute 50x, and one rupee is 100x paise. The total is 70000 paise (since 700 rupees is 700 * 100 = 70000 paise).\n\nSo the equation would be 25x +50x +100x =70000.\n\nAdding them: 25+50=75, plus 100 is 175. So 175x=70000.\n\nDivide both sides by 175: x=70000/175.\n\nHmm, 70000 divided by 175. Let me compute that. 175 times 400 is 70,000 because 175 * 400 = (175 *4)*100 = 700 *100=70,000. So yes, x=400.
