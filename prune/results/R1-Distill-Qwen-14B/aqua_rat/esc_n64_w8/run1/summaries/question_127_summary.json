      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about alloys made of zinc and copper. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the ratio of zinc to copper in a new alloy formed by mixing two other alloys. \n\nAlright, let's break it down. So, there are two alloys, X and Y. Alloy X has zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9, and alloy Y is 7:11. Then, we take 40 grams of X and 60 grams of Y and mix them to make alloy Z. We need to find the new ratio.\n\nWait, ratios can sometimes be tricky because they're parts of the whole. So, first, I think I need to figure out how much zinc and copper are in each of the 40g and 60g samples.\n\nLet me start with alloy X. Its ratio is 6:9. So, the total parts are 6+9=15 parts. Each part would be 40g divided by 15 parts. Wait, no, wait. No, wait. No, wait a second. Wait, no, the total mass is 40 grams, which is the total of the alloy. So, the ratio 6:9 means that for every 6 parts of zinc, there are 9 parts of copper. So, the total parts are 15. So, each part is 40g /15. Let me calculate that.\n\nSo, for alloy X:\nZinc: (6/15) * 40g = (6 * 40)/15 = 240/15 = 16 grams.\nCopper: (9/15)*40g = (9*40)/15 = 360/15 = 24 grams.\nSo, X contributes 16g Zn and 24g Cu.\n\nNow, alloy Y has a ratio of 7:11. So total parts are 7+11=18. The sample is 60 grams. So each part is 60/18 = 3.(333) grams. So:\n\nZinc: 7 parts * 3.333... grams per part. Let me calculate 7*60/18. Alternatively, (7/18)*60.\n\nWait, 7*60=420. 420/18= 23.333... grams. Hmm, 23 and 1/3 grams.\n\nCopper: 11/18 *60 = (11*60)/18. 660/18=36.666... grams, which is 36 and 2/3 grams.\n\nSo, Y contributes approximately 23.333g Zn and 36.666g Cu.\n\nNow, when we mix X and Y, the total zinc is 16 + 23.333..., and total copper is 24 +36.666...\n\nLet me add them up.\n\nZinc total: 16 + 23.333... = 39.333... grams.\n\nCopper total: 24 + 36.666... = 60.666... grams.\n\nWait, but I need exact fractions. Let me recalculate using fractions instead of decimals to avoid rounding errors.\n\nFor alloy X:\nZn: 6/15 *40 = (6*40)/15 = 240/15 = 16g.\nCu: 9/15 *40= 24g.\n\nFor alloy Y:\nZn:7/18 *60 = (7*60)/18 = 420/18 = 23.333...g which is 70/3 g.\nWait, 420 divided by 18 is 70/3? Let's see, 18 * 23 = 414, 420-414=6. So 23 and 6/18 = 23 1/3. So yes, 70/3 is 23.333...\n\nSimilarly, copper in Y: 11/18 *60 = (11*60)/18 = 660/18 = 36.666...g = 110/3 g.\n\nSo total Zn is 16 +70/3.\n\nLet me convert 16 to thirds: 16 = 48/3. So 48/3 +70/3 = 118/3 grams.\n\nTotal Cu is 24 + 110/3.\n\n24 is 72/3, so 72/3 +110/3 = 182/3 grams.\n\nSo now, the total mass of Zn is 118/3 g, and Cu is 182/3 g.\n\nSo the ratio is (118/3) : (182/3). The denominators are same, so they cancel out. So ratio is 118:182.\n\nWait, but we can simplify that. Let's see. Both numbers are even, so divide by 2: 59:91.\n\nSo the ratio is 59:91. Now looking at the options:\n\nOptions are A)69:91, B)59:91, C)59:90, D)59:91, E)69:101.\n\nWait, B and D are same. Oh wait, looking back, the options:\n\nWait the user wrote the options as:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nHmm, so B and D are the same. Did I make a mistake? Because according to my calculation, the ratio is 59:91. So the options B and D are same. But looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations.\n\nAlloy X: 6:9, 40g.\n\nZn: (6/15)*40 = (2/5)*40 = 16g. Correct.\n\nCu: 24g. Correct.\n\nAlloy Y: 7:11, 60g.\n\nZn: (7/18)*60 = (7*60)/18 = 420/18 = 23.333g.\n\nCu: 11/18 *60 = 660/18 =36.666g.\n\nAdding X and Y:\n\nZn: 16 + 23.333 = 39.333g. Or 118/3 g.\n\nCu: 24 + 36.666=60.666g. Or 182/3 g.\n\nSo ratio Zn:Cu is (118/3) : (182/3) = 118:182.\n\nSimplify 118/182: Let's see.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2: 59:91.\n\nSo the ratio is 59:91.\n\nLooking at the options, both B and D are 59:91. Wait, that's a problem. Let me check the options again.\n\nWait, the original options as presented by the user:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nWait, options B and D are same. That's probably a typo. Maybe D is different? Or perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the total mass.\n\nWait, 118 and 182: 118 is 59*2, 182 is 91*2. So the ratio is 59:91. So the correct option should be B or D, but they're same. Maybe the options are incorrectly presented.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the initial ratios. Let me check again.\n\nAlloy X: 6:9, so 6 parts Zn, 9 parts Cu. Total 15 parts.\n\nSo 40g divided into 15 parts.\n\nSo Zn is 6*(40/15) = 16g. Cu is 24g. Correct.\n\nAlloy Y:7:11, 18 parts. 60g.\n\nZn is 7*(60/18) = 7*(10/3)=70/3 \u224823.333g. Cu is 11*(60/18)= 11*(10/3)=110/3\u224836.666g. Correct.\n\nTotal Zn: 16 +70/3 = (48+70)/3=118/3.\n\nTotal Cu:24 + 110/3 = (72 +110)/3=182/3.\n\nSo ratio is 118:182 \u2192 59:91.\n\nLooking at the options, both B and D are 59:91. So perhaps it's a mistake, but according to the problem statement, the options are as given. So perhaps the correct answer is either B or D. But since they're same, perhaps it's a typo, but in the options provided, D is same as B. So I think the intended correct answer is 59:91, which is option B and D. But the options are same, so perhaps the correct choice is B or D. But since in the options, B and D are same, perhaps the intended answer is D, but it's same as B. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not the way I calculated. Let me try another approach. Maybe the initial ratios are parts by mass or by volume? No, the problem says ratios, so it's by mass.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the ratio in the final alloy. Wait, perhaps I should find the total zinc and total copper, then express them as a ratio.\n\nSo, total Zn =16 +70/3 = (48 +70)/3 = 118/3 grams.\n\nTotal Cu=24 +110/3 = (72 +110)/3=182/3 grams.\n\nSo the ratio is Zn:Cu = (118/3) : (182/3) = 118:182.\n\nSimplify: 118 \u00f7 2=59; 182 \u00f72=91. So 59:91.\n\nLooking at the options, options B and D are same. So if the options are correct, perhaps both B and D are same, which is a mistake. But in the options, D is 59:91. So perhaps the correct answer is D.\n\nWait, but looking back, the options are presented as:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nSo the correct ratio is 59:91, which is option B and D. But perhaps the problem had a typo and intended D to be something else. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me recheck:\n\nIn alloy X, 6:9 is Zn:Cu. So 6/(6+9)=6/15=0.4. So 0.4*40=16g Zn.\n\nAlloy Y:7/(7+11)=7/18. 7/18 *60= (7*60)/18=420/18=23.333g Zn.\n\nTotal Zn:16+23.333=39.333g.\n\nSimilarly, Cu in X:9/15*40=24g.\n\nCu in Y:11/18*60=36.666g.\n\nTotal Cu:60.666g.\n\nSo Zn:39.333, Cu:60.666.\n\nSo ratio is 39.333:60.666.\n\nWait, but 39.333 is 118/3 and 60.666 is 182/3.\n\nSo 118/3 : 182/3 = 118:182=59:91.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo the correct ratio is 59:91.\n\nLooking at the options, B and D are same. So perhaps the intended correct answer is either B or D, but the options have a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to present options correctly, but in the given options, B and D are same.\n\nAssuming the options are correct as presented, perhaps the correct answer is D)59:91. But since B is same, perhaps it's a mistake.\n\nBut the options as given have B and D same. So perhaps the intended answer is B or D. But the way the options are presented, the correct answer is 59:91, which is options B and D. Since the user's question says option D is 59:91, that would be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in adding the fractions.\n\nWait, 16 is 48/3. 70/3 is 23.333. 48+70=118. So 118/3. Correct.\n\n24 is 72/3. 110/3 is 36.666. 72+110=182. So 182/3. Correct.\n\nSo the ratio is 118:182. Simplify by dividing by 2:59:91. So correct.\n\nSo the answer should be 59:91, which is either option B or D. But in the options, both B and D are same. So perhaps it's a typo, but the correct answer is 59:91. So the correct choice is either B or D. But since the options list D as 59:91, that's the one to choose.\n\nWait, but looking again at the options, option D is 59:91. So the correct answer is D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the ratio of zinc to copper in the final alloy Z, which is formed by mixing 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about alloys made of zinc and copper. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the ratio of zinc to copper in a new alloy formed by mixing two other alloys. \n\nAlright, let's break it down. So, there are two alloys, X and Y. Alloy X has zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9, and alloy Y is 7:11. Then, we take 40 grams of X and 60 grams of Y and mix them to make alloy Z. We need to find the new ratio.\n\nWait, ratios can sometimes be tricky because they're parts of the whole. So, first, I think I need to figure out how much zinc and copper are in each of the 40g and 60g samples.\n\nLet me start with alloy X. Its ratio is 6:9. So, the total parts are 6+9=15 parts. Each part would be 40g divided by 15 parts. Wait, no, wait. No, wait. No, wait a second. Wait, no, the total mass is 40 grams, which is the total of the alloy. So, the ratio 6:9 means that for every 6 parts of zinc, there are 9 parts of copper. So, the total parts are 15. So, each part is 40g /15. Let me calculate that.\n\nSo, for alloy X:\nZinc: (6/15) * 40g = (6 * 40)/15 = 240/15 = 16 grams.\nCopper: (9/15)*40g = (9*40)/15 = 360/15 = 24 grams.\nSo, X contributes 16g Zn and 24g Cu.\n\nNow, alloy Y has a ratio of 7:11. So total parts are 7+11=18. The sample is 60 grams. So each part is 60/18 = 3.(333) grams. So:\n\nZinc: 7 parts * 3.333... grams per part. Let me calculate 7*60/18. Alternatively, (7/18)*60.\n\nWait, 7*60=420. 420/18= 23.333... grams. Hmm, 23 and 1/3 grams.\n\nCopper: 11/18 *60 = (11*60)/18. 660/18=36.666... grams, which is 36 and 2/3 grams.\n\nSo, Y contributes approximately 23.333g Zn and 36.666g Cu.\n\nNow, when we mix X and Y, the total zinc is 16 + 23.333..., and total copper is 24 +36.666...\n\nLet me add them up.\n\nZinc total: 16 + 23.333... = 39.333... grams.\n\nCopper total: 24 + 36.666... = 60.666... grams.\n\nWait, but I need exact fractions.

Let's see, 18 * 23 = 414, 420-414=6. So 23 and 6/18 = 23 1/3. So yes, 70/3 is 23.333...\n\nSimilarly, copper in Y: 11/18 *60 = (11*60)/18 = 660/18 = 36.666...g = 110/3 g.\n\nSo total Zn is 16 +70/3.\n\nLet me convert 16 to thirds: 16 = 48/3. So 48/3 +70/3 = 118/3 grams.\n\nTotal Cu is 24 + 110/3.\n\n24 is 72/3, so 72/3 +110/3 = 182/3 grams.\n\nSo now, the total mass of Zn is 118/3 g, and Cu is 182/3 g.\n\nSo the ratio is (118/3) : (182/3). The denominators are same, so they cancel out. So ratio is 118:182.\n\nWait, but we can simplify that. Let's see. Both numbers are even, so divide by 2: 59:91.\n\nSo the ratio is 59:91.

Since the user's question says option D is 59:91, that would be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in adding the fractions.\n\nWait, 16 is 48/3. 70/3 is 23.333. 48+70=118. So 118/3. Correct.\n\n24 is 72/3. 110/3 is 36.666. 72+110=182. So 182/3. Correct.\n\nSo the ratio is 118:182. Simplify by dividing by 2:59:91. So correct.\n\nSo the answer should be 59:91, which is either option B or D. But in the options, both B and D are same. So perhaps it's a typo, but the correct answer is 59:91. So the correct choice is either B or D. But since the options list D as 59:91, that's the one to choose.\n\nWait, but looking again at the options, option D is 59:91. So the correct answer is D.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the ratio of zinc to copper in the final alloy Z, which is formed by mixing 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y. The ratios of zinc to copper in alloys X and Y are given as 6:9 and 7:11, respectively.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the mass of zinc and copper in alloy X\nAlloy X has a zinc-to-copper ratio of 6:9, which simplifies to a total of 15 parts. Since the total mass of alloy X is 40 grams:\n- Mass of zinc in X = \\( \\frac{6}{15} \\times 40 = 16 \\, \\text{g} \\)\n- Mass of copper in X = \\( \\frac{9}{15} \\times 40 = 24 \\, \\text{g} \\)\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the mass of zinc and copper in alloy Y\nAlloy Y has a zinc-to-copper ratio of 7:11, which simplifies to a total of 18 parts. Since the total mass of alloy Y is 60 grams:\n- Mass of zinc in Y = \\( \\frac{7}{18} \\times 60 = \\frac{420}{18} = 23.333 \\, \\text{g} \\)\n- Mass of copper in Y = \\( \\frac{11}{18} \\times 60 = \\frac{660}{18} = 36.666 \\, \\text{g} \\)\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the total mass of zinc and copper in alloy Z\nWhen 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are mixed:\n- Total zinc = \\( 16 + 23.333 = 39.333 \\, \\text{g} \\)\n- Total copper = \\( 24 + 36.666 = 60.666 \\, \\text{g} \\)\n\n### Step 4: Simplify the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z\nThe ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is:\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio of Zn:Cu} = \\frac{39.333}{60.666}\n\\]\nTo simplify, multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate decimals:\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio of Zn:Cu} = \\frac{118}{182}\n\\]\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio of Zn:Cu} = \\frac{59}{91}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Match the result with the options\nThe calculated ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is \\( 59:91 \\). Among the given options:\n- A) \\( 69:91 \\)\n- B) \\( 59:91 \\)\n- C) \\( 59:90 \\)\n- D) \\( 59:91 \\)\n- E) \\( 69:101 \\)\n\nBoth options B and D are identical (\\( 59:91 \\)). Since D is listed as \\( 59:91 \\), it is the correct choice.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about alloys, and I need to find the ratio of zinc to copper in the final alloy Z. Hmm, let me try to break it down.\n\nAlright, the problem says there are two alloys, X and Y. Alloy X is made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9. Alloy Y has a ratio of 7:11. Then, they melt 40 grams of X and 60 grams of Y and mix them to form Z. I need to find the ratio of zinc to copper in Z.\n\nWait, ratios can sometimes be tricky. Let me think about how to approach this. Each alloy has a certain proportion of zinc and copper. When we mix them, the total zinc will be the sum from both alloys, and the same for copper. So I need to find how much zinc and copper are in each 40g of X and 60g of Y, then add them up.\n\nFirst, let's tackle alloy X. The ratio is 6:9, which I can simplify. Wait, 6:9 is the same as 2:3. So for every 2 parts zinc, there are 3 parts copper. But I need to find the actual grams. Oh wait, the total parts for X would be 2+3=5 parts. So each part is 40g divided by 5 parts, which is 8g per part. So zinc in X is 2 parts * 8g = 16g. Copper is 3*8=24g. Okay, so X contributes 16g Zn and 24g Cu.\n\nNow alloy Y. Its ratio is 7:11. So total parts are 7+11=18. The total mass is 60g. So each part is 60/18 = 3.333... grams. Wait, 60 divided by 18 is 10/3, which is approximately 3.333g per part. So zinc in Y is 7*(10/3) = 70/3 \u224823.333g. Copper is 11*(10/3) = 110/3 \u224836.666g. \n\nSo now, when we mix X and Y, the total zinc is 16g + 70/3g. Let me calculate that. 16 is 48/3, so adding 70/3 gives 118/3 grams of zinc. Similarly, the copper is 24g + 110/3g. 24 is 72/3, so adding 110/3 gives 182/3 grams of copper.\n\nSo now, the total zinc is 118/3 grams and copper is 182/3 grams. To find the ratio, I can take these two quantities and simplify. Let's write them as fractions: (118/3) : (182/3). Oh wait, since both are over 3, the denominators cancel out. So the ratio is 118:182.\n\nHmm, can I simplify that? Let's see. Both numbers are even, so divide by 2: 59:91. Oh, wait, 59 is a prime number because it's not divisible by anything except 1 and 59. So 59:91 is the simplified ratio.\n\nLooking at the options, let me check. Option D says 59:91. Option B is 59:91 as well? Wait, no, looking back, option D is 59:91. Oh wait, let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA)69:91\nB)59:91\nC)59:90\nD)59:91\nE)69:101\n\nWait, both B and D are 59:91? Oh, that can't be. Wait, maybe I read the options wrong. Let me double-check the problem statement. Oh, no, the options are as listed. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nWait, did I compute the correct grams for each alloy?\n\nFor X: 40g in ratio 6:9. So 6+9=15 parts? Wait, wait a minute. Wait, wait, no! Oh no! I think I made a mistake earlier. Because when I first thought about alloy X, the ratio was 6:9. So 6 parts zinc to 9 parts copper. So total parts are 15, not 5. Oh no! Did I mess that up?\n\nWait, yes! Oh no, that changes everything. Because 6:9 is 2:3, but the total parts are 6+9=15, not 5. So when I thought 6:9 as 2:3, I might have thought the total parts are 5, but that's incorrect because the ratio is 6:9, which is 2:3, but the actual total parts are 15, not 5.\n\nWait, so let me re-calculate alloy X correctly.\n\nAlloy X: 6:9 ratio, which simplifies to 2:3. So each part is 40g divided by (6+9) =15 parts. So each part is 40/15 = 8/3 \u22482.6667 grams. So zinc in X is 6*(8/3) = 16g. Oh wait, same as before. Oh, because 6*(8/3) is (6/3)*8=2*8=16. Similarly, copper is 9*(8/3)=24g. So my initial calculation for X was correct. Because 6:9 is same as 2:3, so each part is 40/15 = 8/3, but 6 parts gives 16g, which is same as the initial approach. So no problem there. So X is correct.\n\nBut for alloy Y, the ratio is 7:11. So 7+11=18 parts. So each part is 60/18 = 10/3 grams. So zinc is 7*(10/3)=70/3\u224823.333g. Copper is 11*(10/3)=110/3\u224836.666g. That part is correct.\n\nSo, when adding, total zinc is 16 + 70/3. Let me compute that. 16 is 48/3, so 48/3 +70/3=118/3 g. Copper is 24 +110/3. 24 is 72/3, so 72/3 +110/3=182/3 g.\n\nSo the ratio is (118/3) : (182/3). Which is same as 118:182. Simplify.\n\n118 and 182, let's see what divides them. Let's factor 118: 2*59. 182: 2*91. 91 is 7*13. So 118:182 simplifies to 59:91. So the ratio is 59:91.\n\nLooking at the options, option B and D are both 59:91. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check the options again.\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nWait, so both B and D are the same. That must be a typo in the options. Hmm, but the correct ratio is 59:91, so the correct answer would be either B or D. But looking at the options, perhaps the intended correct answer is D)59:91.\n\nWait, but in the original options, the user wrote:\n\nOptions:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nSo both B and D are same. That's a problem. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, but wait, no, in the problem statement, the options are as the user wrote. So perhaps the correct answer is option D, but perhaps in the actual problem, the options are different. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated.\n\nWait, another way to approach this: perhaps I should calculate the total mass of zinc and copper from each alloy and then find the ratio.\n\nLet me recompute everything step by step.\n\nAlloy X:\n\nRatio Zn:Cu =6:9 = 2:3.\n\nTotal parts =6+9=15.\n\nMass of X is 40g.\n\nSo each part is 40 /15 = 8/3 grams.\n\nZn in X: 6*(8/3) = 48/3 =16g.\n\nCu in X:9*(8/3)=24g.\n\nAlloy Y:\n\nRatio Zn:Cu=7:11.\n\nTotal parts=18.\n\nMass of Y is 60g.\n\nEach part is 60/18=10/3 grams.\n\nZn in Y:7*(10/3)=70/3 \u224823.333g.\n\nCu in Y:11*(10/3)=110/3\u224836.666g.\n\nTotal Zn=16 +70/3 = (48/3 +70/3)=118/3 \u224839.333g.\n\nTotal Cu=24 +110/3= (72/3 +110/3)=182/3\u224860.666g.\n\nSo ratio Zn:Cu= (118/3) : (182/3) =118:182.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2:59:91.\n\nSo the ratio is 59:91. Looking at options, both B and D are 59:91. So perhaps the correct option is D. Wait, but in the given options, both B and D are same, which is confusing. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the options.\n\nWait, let me check the options again. The user wrote:\n\nOptions:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nHmm, so B and D are same. That must be a mistake in the problem statement. So perhaps the intended correct answer is D, but perhaps it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B, but it's the same as D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Wait, perhaps I should compute the total Zn and Cu another way.\n\nAnother approach: find the amount of Zn and Cu in each alloy, then sum.\n\nAlloy X: 40g, ratio Zn:Cu=6:9.\n\nSo Zn is (6/15)*40 = (6*40)/15=240/15=16g.\n\nCu is (9/15)*40=24g.\n\nAlloy Y:60g, ratio 7:11.\n\nZn is (7/18)*60=7* (60/18)=7*(10/3)=70/3\u224823.333g.\n\nCu is (11/18)*60=11*(10/3)=110/3\u224836.666g.\n\nTotal Zn=16 +70/3= (48+70)/3=118/3.\n\nTotal Cu=24 +110/3= (72+110)/3=182/3.\n\nSo the ratio is 118/3 : 182/3 =118:182=59:91.\n\nSo the ratio is 59:91.\n\nLooking at the options, both B and D are 59:91. So perhaps the intended answer is D. But that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B, but in the problem, the options may have D as 59:91, which is the correct one.\n\nWait, but in the options, D is 59:91, same as B. So perhaps the correct answer is option D.\n\nBut wait, looking back, the options as presented have B and D as same. So perhaps the correct answer is D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are different. Maybe the problem intended that the correct option is D. So the answer is D)59:91.\n",

So for every 2 parts zinc, there are 3 parts copper. But I need to find the actual grams. Oh wait, the total parts for X would be 2+3=5 parts. So each part is 40g divided by 5 parts, which is 8g per part. So zinc in X is 2 parts * 8g = 16g. Copper is 3*8=24g. Okay, so X contributes 16g Zn and 24g Cu.\n\nNow alloy Y. Its ratio is 7:11. So total parts are 7+11=18. The total mass is 60g. So each part is 60/18 = 3.333... grams. Wait, 60 divided by 18 is 10/3, which is approximately 3.333g per part. So zinc in Y is 7*(10/3) = 70/3 \u224823.333g. Copper is 11*(10/3) = 110/3 \u224836.666g. \n\nSo now, when we mix X and Y, the total zinc is 16g + 70/3g. Let me calculate that. 16 is 48/3, so adding 70/3 gives 118/3 grams of zinc. Similarly, the copper is 24g + 110/3g. 24 is 72/3, so adding 110/3 gives 182/3 grams of copper.\n\nSo now, the total zinc is 118/3 grams and copper is 182/3 grams.

I think I made a mistake earlier. Because when I first thought about alloy X, the ratio was 6:9. So 6 parts zinc to 9 parts copper. So total parts are 15, not 5. Oh no! Did I mess that up?\n\nWait, yes! Oh no, that changes everything. Because 6:9 is 2:3, but the total parts are 6+9=15, not 5. So when I thought 6:9 as 2:3, I might have thought the total parts are 5, but that's incorrect because the ratio is 6:9, which is 2:3, but the actual total parts are 15, not 5.\n\nWait, so let me re-calculate alloy X correctly.\n\nAlloy X: 6:9 ratio, which simplifies to 2:3. So each part is 40g divided by (6+9) =15 parts. So each part is 40/15 = 8/3 \u22482.6667 grams. So zinc in X is 6*(8/3) = 16g. Oh wait, same as before. Oh, because 6*(8/3) is (6/3)*8=2*8=16. Similarly, copper is 9*(8/3)=24g. So my initial calculation for X was correct. Because 6:9 is same as 2:3, so each part is 40/15 = 8/3, but 6 parts gives 16g, which is same as the initial approach. So no problem there. So X is correct.\n\nBut for alloy Y, the ratio is 7:11. So 7+11=18 parts. So each part is 60/18 = 10/3 grams. So zinc is 7*(10/3)=70/3\u224823.333g. Copper is 11*(10/3)=110/3\u224836.666g. That part is correct.\n\nSo, when adding, total zinc is 16 + 70/3. Let me compute that. 16 is 48/3, so 48/3 +70/3=118/3 g. Copper is 24 +110/3. 24 is 72/3, so 72/3 +110/3=182/3 g.\n\nSo the ratio is (118/3) : (182/3). Which is same as 118:182. Simplify.\n\n118 and 182, let's see what divides them. Let's factor 118: 2*59. 182: 2*91. 91 is 7*13. So 118:182 simplifies to 59:91. So the ratio is 59:91.\n\nLooking at the options, option B and D are both 59:91. Wait, that can't be right.

Or perhaps I made a mistake in the options.\n\nWait, let me check the options again. The user wrote:\n\nOptions:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nHmm, so B and D are same.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B, but it's the same as D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Wait, perhaps I should compute the total Zn and Cu another way.\n\nAnother approach: find the amount of Zn and Cu in each alloy, then sum.\n\nAlloy X: 40g, ratio Zn:Cu=6:9.\n\nSo Zn is (6/15)*40 = (6*40)/15=240/15=16g.\n\nCu is (9/15)*40=24g.\n\nAlloy Y:60g, ratio 7:11.\n\nZn is (7/18)*60=7* (60/18)=7*(10/3)=70/3\u224823.333g.\n\nCu is (11/18)*60=11*(10/3)=110/3\u224836.666g.\n\nTotal Zn=16 +70/3= (48+70)/3=118/3.\n\nTotal Cu=24 +110/3= (72+110)/3=182/3.\n\nSo the ratio is 118/3 : 182/3 =118:182=59:91.\n\nSo the ratio is 59:91.\n\nLooking at the options, both B and D are 59:91. So perhaps the intended answer is D. But that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B, but in the problem, the options may have D as 59:91, which is the correct one.\n\nWait, but in the options, D is 59:91, same as B. So perhaps the correct answer is option D.\n\nBut wait, looking back, the options as presented have B and D as same. So perhaps the correct answer is D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are different. Maybe the problem intended that the correct option is D.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about alloys made from zinc and copper. Hmm, let me read it again. So, X and Y are two alloys. X has zinc and copper in a 6:9 ratio, and Y has a 7:11 ratio. Then, they take 40 grams of X and 60 grams of Y, melt them, and mix to form alloy Z. I need to find the ratio of zinc to copper in Z.\n\nAlright, I think the first step is to figure out how much zinc and copper are in each of the alloys X and Y. Then, when they mix them, I can add up the total zinc and total copper, and find the new ratio.\n\nLet me start with alloy X. The ratio is 6:9. Wait, that's parts of zinc to copper. So, for every 6 parts zinc, there's 9 parts copper. But what's the total parts? 6+9=15 parts. So each part is the same in X.\n\nBut how much does each part weigh? Because the alloy is 40 grams. Oh wait, no, the alloy X is 40 grams when taken. Wait, no. The ratio is 6:9, so I think each part is a fraction of the total alloy. So for X, the total alloy is 40 grams.\n\nWait, no, no. Wait, the problem says that 40 grams of alloy X is taken. So the 6:9 ratio is for each alloy, but when they melt 40g of X and 60g of Y, I need to find the amount of Zn and Cu in each of those.\n\nSo, for alloy X: 6 parts Zn and 9 parts Cu. So, each part is 1 unit, and 6+9=15 units. So each unit is (mass of alloy X) /15. Wait, but the alloy X is 40 grams. So each part is 40g /15. So Zn in X is 6 * (40/15) and Cu is 9*(40/15).\n\nWait, let me compute that. 40 divided by 15 is 8/3 grams per part. So Zn is 6*(8/3) = 16 grams. Cu is 9*(8/3) = 24 grams. So in 40g of X, there's 16g Zn and 24g Cu.\n\nNow for alloy Y. The ratio is 7:11. So parts are 7 Zn and 11 Cu. Total parts 18. And the alloy Y used is 60 grams. So each part is 60g /18 = 10/3 grams per part.\n\nSo Zn in Y is 7*(10/3) = 70/3 \u224823.333 grams. Cu is 11*(10/3)= 110/3 \u224836.666 grams.\n\nNow, when they mix X and Y, the total Zn is 16 + 70/3. Let me compute that. 16 is 48/3, so 48/3 +70/3 =118/3 grams.\n\nTotal Cu is 24 + 110/3. 24 is 72/3, so 72/3 +110/3= 182/3 grams.\n\nNow, the total mass of Z is 40 +60=100 grams. But the question is about the ratio of Zn to Cu.\n\nSo Zn is 118/3 grams, Cu is 182/3 grams. So the ratio is (118/3) : (182/3). The denominators are same, so it's 118:182.\n\nWait, can I simplify that? Let's see. Both numbers are even, so divide by 2: 59:91.\n\nSo the ratio is 59:91. Looking at the options, option D is 59:91, and option B is 59:91 as well? Wait no, checking the options:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nSo both B and D are 59:91. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the amounts.\n\nWait, let me recalculate alloy X:\n\nAlloy X: 6:9 ratio. 40 grams total.\n\nEach part is 40/(6+9) =40/15=8/3 grams.\n\nZn:6 * 8/3 =16 grams.\n\nCu:9 *8/3=24 grams. That seems correct.\n\nAlloy Y: 7:11 ratio, 60 grams.\n\nEach part is 60/(7+11)=60/18=10/3 grams.\n\nZn:7 *10/3=70/3 \u224823.333 grams.\n\nCu:11 *10/3=110/3 \u224836.666 grams.\n\nTotal Zn: 16 +70/3 = (48 +70)/3=118/3 \u224839.333 grams.\n\nTotal Cu:24 +110/3 = (72 +110)/3=182/3\u224860.666 grams.\n\nSo ratio is (118/3) : (182/3) =118:182.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2: 59:91.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about alloys made of zinc and copper. Hmm, let me see. The question says that X and Y are two alloys. Alloy X is made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9, and Alloy Y is in the ratio 7:11. Then, 40 grams of X and 60 grams of Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z. I need to find the ratio of zinc to copper in Z.\n\nWait, ratios can be a bit tricky. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you mix two alloys, you have to calculate the amount of each metal contributed by each alloy and then add them together.\n\nSo, let's break down each alloy first. For Alloy X, the ratio is 6:9. That's zinc to copper. Oh wait, ratios are usually part to part, so 6 parts zinc to 9 parts copper. I think I should find out how much zinc and copper are in each gram of alloy X.\n\nWait, how do I do that? Oh right, the total parts for X would be 6+9=15 parts. So each part is 1/15 of the alloy's weight. So for Alloy X, each gram has (6/15) grams of zinc and (9/15) grams of copper per gram.\n\nBut wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the ratio is 6:9, meaning for every 15 grams of alloy X, 6 grams are zinc and 9 are copper. So for any given weight of X, the amounts are based on that ratio.\n\nSo, let's take 40 grams of X. How much zinc is that? (6/15) * 40 grams. Let me compute that. 6/15 is 0.4. 0.4 *40=16 grams of zinc. And the copper would be (9/15)*40 = 24 grams.\n\nWait, 9/15 is 0.6. 0.6 *40=24 grams. That makes sense because 16+24=40.\n\nNow, for Alloy Y, the ratio is 7:11. So that's zinc to copper. Let's compute the same for 60 grams of Y.\n\nTotal parts for Y are 7+11=18 parts. So each part is 1/18 of the alloy's weight.\n\nSo, zinc in Y is (7/18)*60 grams. 7/18 is approximately 0.3889, but let me compute it exactly. 7 *60 =420; 420/18=23.333... grams of zinc. Or 23 and 1/3 grams.\n\nCopper in Y is (11/18)*60. 11 *60=660. 660/18=36.666... grams, which is 36 and 2/3 grams.\n\nWait, adding them together, 23.333 + 36.666 is 60 grams. Perfect.\n\nNow, to find the total zinc and copper in alloy Z, I need to add the contributions from X and Y.\n\nZinc from X: 16 grams.\n\nZinc from Y: approximately 23.333 grams.\n\nTotal zinc: 16 +23.333 = 39.333 grams.

Hmm, I need to simplify this ratio.\n\nWait, let me write them as fractions to make it precise. 39.333 is 118/3 grams (since 118 \u00f73=39.333), and 60.666 is 182/3 grams (because 182 \u00f73=60.666).\n\nSo the ratio is (118/3) : (182/3). The denominators are the same, so I can ignore them for the ratio, so it becomes 118:182.\n\nNow, I need to simplify 118:182. Let's find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these two numbers.\n\nHmm, 118 and 182.\n\nLet's factor them.\n\n118: 2 *59.\n\n182: 2 *91.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about alloys made of zinc and copper. Hmm, let me see. The question says that X and Y are two alloys. Alloy X is made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9, and Alloy Y is in the ratio 7:11. Then, 40 grams of X and 60 grams of Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z. I need to find the ratio of zinc to copper in Z.\n\nWait, ratios can be a bit tricky. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you mix two alloys, you have to calculate the amount of each metal contributed by each alloy and then add them together.\n\nSo, let's break down each alloy first. For Alloy X, the ratio is 6:9. That's zinc to copper. Oh wait, ratios are usually part to part, so 6 parts zinc to 9 parts copper. I think I should find out how much zinc and copper are in each gram of alloy X.\n\nWait, how do I do that? Oh right, the total parts for X would be 6+9=15 parts. So each part is 1/15 of the alloy's weight. So for Alloy X, each gram has (6/15) grams of zinc and (9/15) grams of copper per gram.\n\nBut wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the ratio is 6:9, meaning for every 15 grams of alloy X, 6 grams are zinc and 9 are copper. So for any given weight of X, the amounts are based on that ratio.\n\nSo, let's take 40 grams of X. How much zinc is that? (6/15) * 40 grams. Let me compute that. 6/15 is 0.4. 0.4 *40=16 grams of zinc. And the copper would be (9/15)*40 = 24 grams.\n\nWait, 9/15 is 0.6. 0.6 *40=24 grams. That makes sense because 16+24=40.\n\nNow, for Alloy Y, the ratio is 7:11. So that's zinc to copper. Let's compute the same for 60 grams of Y.\n\nTotal parts for Y are 7+11=18 parts. So each part is 1/18 of the alloy's weight.\n\nSo, zinc in Y is (7/18)*60 grams. 7/18 is approximately 0.3889, but let me compute it exactly. 7 *60 =420; 420/18=23.333... grams of zinc. Or 23 and 1/3 grams.\n\nCopper in Y is (11/18)*60. 11 *60=660. 660/18=36.666... grams, which is 36 and 2/3 grams.\n\nWait, adding them together, 23.333 + 36.666 is 60 grams. Perfect.\n\nNow, to find the total zinc and copper in alloy Z, I need to add the contributions from X and Y.\n\nZinc from X: 16 grams.\n\nZinc from Y: approximately 23.333 grams.\n\nTotal zinc: 16 +23.333 = 39.333 grams. Or exactly, 39 and 1/3 grams.\n\nCopper from X:24 grams.\n\nCopper from Y:36.666 grams.\n\nTotal copper: 24 +36.666=60.666 grams. Which is 60 and 2/3 grams.\n\nNow, the ratio of zinc to copper is 39.333:60.666. Hmm, I need to simplify this ratio.\n\nWait, let me write them as fractions to make it precise. 39.333 is 118/3 grams (since 118 \u00f73=39.333), and 60.666 is 182/3 grams (because 182 \u00f73=60.666).\n\nSo the ratio is (118/3) : (182/3). The denominators are the same, so I can ignore them for the ratio, so it becomes 118:182.\n\nNow, I need to simplify 118:182. Let's find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these two numbers.\n\nHmm, 118 and 182.\n\nLet's factor them.\n\n118: 2 *59.\n\n182: 2 *91.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about alloys made of zinc and copper. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nAlright, so the question says that X and Y are two alloys. Alloy X has zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9, and Alloy Y is in the ratio 7:11. Then, they take 40 grams of X and 60 grams of Y, melt them, and mix them to form Alloy Z. I need to find the ratio of zinc to copper in Z.\n\nWait, ratios can sometimes be tricky, but I think I can handle this. So, first, I should probably find out how much zinc and copper are in each of the 40g and 60g samples of X and Y, respectively.\n\nLet me start with Alloy X. The ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9. Hmm, that simplifies to 2:3, right? Because 6 divided by 3 is 2, and 9 divided by 3 is 3. So, the total parts in X are 2 + 3 = 5 parts. \n\nSo, in 40 grams of Alloy X, how much is zinc and how much is copper? Let's calculate. Each part would be 40g divided by 5 parts, which is 8 grams per part. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, no, the 40 grams is the total mass of the alloy. So, the mass of zinc would be (6/5) * 40, and copper would be (9/5)*40? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no. The ratio is 6:9, so total parts are 15? No, wait, 6 +9 is 15? Wait no, 6+9 is 15? Oh wait, wait, 6+9 is 15? No, wait, 6+9 is 15, yes. Oh wait, no, no, wait, 6:9 is the same as 2:3. So, the total parts are 2+3=5, but wait, no, the ratio is 6:9, which is 2:3, but the parts are 6 and 9. So maybe the total is 15 parts? Because 6+9=15.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think. For Alloy X, the ratio is 6:9. So, for every 6 parts of zinc, there are 9 parts of copper. So, the total parts are 6+9=15. So each gram of Alloy X is (6/15) zinc and (9/15) copper.\n\nBut wait, when you have a ratio, it's by weight, right? So, in Alloy X, the percentage of zinc is 6/(6+9) = 6/15 = 2/5, and copper is 9/15 = 3/5.\n\nSo, when you take 40 grams of X, the mass of zinc is (2/5)*40, and copper is (3/5)*40. Let me compute that.\n\nZinc in X: (2/5)*40 = (80/5) = 16 grams.\nCopper in X: (3/5)*40 = (120/5) = 24 grams.\n\nOkay, that makes sense. So 16g Zn and 24g Cu from X.\n\nNow, moving on to Alloy Y. The ratio is 7:11, which is zinc to copper. So the total parts are 7+11=18.\n\nSo, in 60 grams of Y, the mass of zinc is (7/18)*60, and copper is (11/18)*60.\n\nCalculating that:\n\nZinc in Y: (7/18)*60 = (420/18) = 23.333... grams. Wait, 60 divided by 18 is 3.333... times 7 is 23.333. So about 23.333g.\n\nCopper in Y: (11/18)*60 = (660/18) = 36.666... grams. So 36.666g.\n\nSo, now, when we mix 40g of X and 60g of Y, the total mass of Z is 40 +60=100 grams.\n\nThe total zinc is 16g (from X) +23.333g (from Y) = 39.333 grams.\n\nThe total copper is 24g (from X) +36.666g (from Y) = 60.666 grams.\n\nWait, let me do that again. 16 +23.333 is 39.333, and 24 +36.666 is 60.666. Hmm.\n\nSo, the ratio of zinc to copper in Z is 39.333 : 60.666.\n\nBut I need to express this as a ratio in simplest terms. Let me convert these to fractions to avoid decimals.\n\nWait, 23.333 is 70/3, because 70 divided by 3 is about 23.333. Similarly, 36.666 is 110/3.\n\nSo, total zinc is 16g (from X) + 70/3 g (from Y) = (48/3 +70/3) = 118/3 grams.\n\nWait, wait, 16g is 48/3, yes. So 48/3 +70/3 = 118/3.\n\nSimilarly, copper is 24g + 110/3 g.\n\n24g is 72/3, so 72/3 +110/3 = 182/3 grams.\n\nSo, zinc is 118/3, copper is 182/3.\n\nSo, the ratio is (118/3) : (182/3) \u2192 the denominators are same, so they cancel out. So, 118:182.\n\nNow, I need to simplify this ratio. Let's see.\n\nWhat's the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 118 and 182?\n\nLet's factor them:\n\n118: 2 \u00d7 59.\n\n182: 2 \u00d7 91. 91 is 7 \u00d713.\n\nSo, both have a common factor of 2. So, dividing both by 2: 59:91.\n\nSo, the ratio is 59:91.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 59:91, and option B is 59:91 as well? Wait, let me check the options again.\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101.\n\nWait, both B and D are 59:91? That can't be right.

Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the problem says options are:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nWait, that can't be correct because B and D are same. So perhaps the correct option is D.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me go through the calculations again.\n\nWait, I think I did the right steps. Let me recap.\n\nAlloy X: 40g, ratio Zn:Cu =6:9=2:3.\n\nSo, 40g is 2 parts Zn and 3 parts Cu. Wait, but wait, no, wait, 6:9 is per each part. So, per 15g, 6g Zn and 9g Cu. So, for 40g, the Zn is (6/15)*40= (2/5)*40=16g, and Cu is 24g.\n\nAlloy Y: 60g, ratio 7:11.\n\nSo, per 18g, 7g Zn and 11g Cu.\n\nSo, for 60g, Zn is (7/18)*60=70/3\u224823.333g.\n\nCu is (11/18)*60= 110/3\u224836.666g.\n\nTotal Zn in Z: 16 +70/3 = 48/3 +70/3=118/3.\n\nTotal Cu in Z:24 +110/3 =72/3 +110/3=182/3.\n\nSo ratio is (118/3) : (182/3) =118:182.\n\nSimplify by dividing by 2 \u219259:91.\n\nSo the ratio is 59:91.\n\nLooking at the options, both B and D are 59:91. That must be a typo in the options. But perhaps in the original question, options B and D are different. Hmm, but the user presented the options as:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nSo, both B and D are same. That's probably a mistake, but in any case, the correct answer is 59:91.\n\nSo, the correct option would be either B or D. But looking at the options, B and D are same. So perhaps in the actual problem, it's different, but as per the given, the correct ratio is 59:91, so the answer is D.\n\nWait, but in the options given, D is also 59:91. So the correct answer is D.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated the ratios. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: Instead of fractions, perhaps using actual grams.\n\nFor Alloy X: 40g, Zn:Cu is 6:9 \u2192 2:3.\n\nTotal parts 5. So Zn is (2/5)*40 =16g, Cu is 24g. Correct.\n\nAlloy Y:60g, Zn:Cu is7:11\u219218 parts.\n\nZn: (7/18)*60=23.333g, Cu=36.666g. Correct.\n\nAdding them: Zn=16+23.333=39.333g, Cu=24+36.666=60.666g.\n\nRatio is 39.333:60.666.\n\nMultiply both by 3 to eliminate decimals: 118:182.\n\nSimplify by dividing by 2:59:91.\n\nYes, same result. So the answer is 59:91. So the correct option is D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about alloys made of zinc and copper. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nAlright, so the question says that X and Y are two alloys. Alloy X has zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9, and Alloy Y is in the ratio 7:11. Then, they take 40 grams of X and 60 grams of Y, melt them, and mix them to form Alloy Z. I need to find the ratio of zinc to copper in Z.\n\nWait, ratios can sometimes be tricky, but I think I can handle this. So, first, I should probably find out how much zinc and copper are in each of the 40g and 60g samples of X and Y, respectively.\n\nLet me start with Alloy X. The ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9. Hmm, that simplifies to 2:3, right? Because 6 divided by 3 is 2, and 9 divided by 3 is 3. So, the total parts in X are 2 + 3 = 5 parts. \n\nSo, in 40 grams of Alloy X, how much is zinc and how much is copper? Let's calculate. Each part would be 40g divided by 5 parts, which is 8 grams per part. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, no, the 40 grams is the total mass of the alloy. So, the mass of zinc would be (6/5) * 40, and copper would be (9/5)*40? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no. The ratio is 6:9, so total parts are 15? No, wait, 6 +9 is 15? Wait no, 6+9 is 15? Oh wait, wait, 6+9 is 15? No, wait, 6+9 is 15, yes. Oh wait, no, no, wait, 6:9 is the same as 2:3. So, the total parts are 2+3=5, but wait, no, the ratio is 6:9, which is 2:3, but the parts are 6 and 9. So maybe the total is 15 parts? Because 6+9=15.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think. For Alloy X, the ratio is 6:9. So, for every 6 parts of zinc, there are 9 parts of copper. So, the total parts are 6+9=15. So each gram of Alloy X is (6/15) zinc and (9/15) copper.\n\nBut wait, when you have a ratio, it's by weight, right? So, in Alloy X, the percentage of zinc is 6/(6+9) = 6/15 = 2/5, and copper is 9/15 = 3/5.\n\nSo, when you take 40 grams of X, the mass of zinc is (2/5)*40, and copper is (3/5)*40. Let me compute that.\n\nZinc in X: (2/5)*40 = (80/5) = 16 grams.\nCopper in X: (3/5)*40 = (120/5) = 24 grams.\n\nOkay, that makes sense. So 16g Zn and 24g Cu from X.\n\nNow, moving on to Alloy Y. The ratio is 7:11, which is zinc to copper. So the total parts are 7+11=18.\n\nSo, in 60 grams of Y, the mass of zinc is (7/18)*60, and copper is (11/18)*60.\n\nCalculating that:\n\nZinc in Y: (7/18)*60 = (420/18) = 23.333... grams. Wait, 60 divided by 18 is 3.333... times 7 is 23.333. So about 23.333g.\n\nCopper in Y: (11/18)*60 = (660/18) = 36.666... grams. So 36.666g.\n\nSo, now, when we mix 40g of X and 60g of Y, the total mass of Z is 40 +60=100 grams.\n\nThe total zinc is 16g (from X) +23.333g (from Y) = 39.333 grams.\n\nThe total copper is 24g (from X) +36.666g (from Y) = 60.666 grams.\n\nWait, let me do that again. 16 +23.333 is 39.333, and 24 +36.666 is 60.666. Hmm.\n\nSo, the ratio of zinc to copper in Z is 39.333 : 60.666.\n\nBut I need to express this as a ratio in simplest terms. Let me convert these to fractions to avoid decimals.\n\nWait, 23.333 is 70/3, because 70 divided by 3 is about 23.333. Similarly, 36.666 is 110/3.\n\nSo, total zinc is 16g (from X) + 70/3 g (from Y) = (48/3 +70/3) = 118/3 grams.\n\nWait, wait, 16g is 48/3, yes. So 48/3 +70/3 = 118/3.\n\nSimilarly, copper is 24g + 110/3 g.\n\n24g is 72/3, so 72/3 +110/3 = 182/3 grams.\n\nSo, zinc is 118/3, copper is 182/3.\n\nSo, the ratio is (118/3) : (182/3) \u2192 the denominators are same, so they cancel out. So, 118:182.\n\nNow, I need to simplify this ratio. Let's see.\n\nWhat's the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 118 and 182?\n\nLet's factor them:\n\n118: 2 \u00d7 59.\n\n182: 2 \u00d7 91. 91 is 7 \u00d713.\n\nSo, both have a common factor of 2. So, dividing both by 2: 59:91.\n\nSo, the ratio is 59:91.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 59:91, and option B is 59:91 as well? Wait, let me check the options again.\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101.\n\nWait, both B and D are 59:91? That can't be right. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nNo, no. The user wrote the options as:\n\nOptions:\nA)69:91\nB)59:91\nC)59:90\nD)59:91\nE)69:101\n\nWait, that's a mistake. Both B and D are same? Or perhaps a typo. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the problem says options are:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nWait, that can't be correct because B and D are same. So perhaps the correct option is D.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me go through the calculations again.\n\nWait, I think I did the right steps. Let me recap.\n\nAlloy X: 40g, ratio Zn:Cu =6:9=2:3.\n\nSo, 40g is 2 parts Zn and 3 parts Cu. Wait, but wait, no, wait, 6:9 is per each part. So, per 15g, 6g Zn and 9g Cu. So, for 40g, the Zn is (6/15)*40= (2/5)*40=16g, and Cu is 24g.\n\nAlloy Y: 60g, ratio 7:11.\n\nSo, per 18g, 7g Zn and 11g Cu.\n\nSo, for 60g, Zn is (7/18)*60=70/3\u224823.333g.\n\nCu is (11/18)*60= 110/3\u224836.666g.\n\nTotal Zn in Z: 16 +70/3 = 48/3 +70/3=118/3.\n\nTotal Cu in Z:24 +110/3 =72/3 +110/3=182/3.\n\nSo ratio is (118/3) : (182/3) =118:182.\n\nSimplify by dividing by 2 \u219259:91.\n\nSo the ratio is 59:91.\n\nLooking at the options, both B and D are 59:91. That must be a typo in the options. But perhaps in the original question, options B and D are different. Hmm, but the user presented the options as:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nSo, both B and D are same. That's probably a mistake, but in any case, the correct answer is 59:91.\n\nSo, the correct option would be either B or D. But looking at the options, B and D are same. So perhaps in the actual problem, it's different, but as per the given, the correct ratio is 59:91, so the answer is D.\n\nWait, but in the options given, D is also 59:91. So the correct answer is D.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated the ratios. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: Instead of fractions, perhaps using actual grams.\n\nFor Alloy X: 40g, Zn:Cu is 6:9 \u2192 2:3.\n\nTotal parts 5. So Zn is (2/5)*40 =16g, Cu is 24g. Correct.\n\nAlloy Y:60g, Zn:Cu is7:11\u219218 parts.\n\nZn: (7/18)*60=23.333g, Cu=36.666g. Correct.\n\nAdding them: Zn=16+23.333=39.333g, Cu=24+36.666=60.666g.\n\nRatio is 39.333:60.666.\n\nMultiply both by 3 to eliminate decimals: 118:182.\n\nSimplify by dividing by 2:59:91.\n\nYes, same result. So the answer is 59:91. So the correct option is D.\n\n\nTo determine the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z, we start by analyzing the composition of alloys X and Y based on their given ratios and the masses provided.\n\n### Step 1: Composition of Alloy X\nAlloy X has a zinc-to-copper ratio of 6:9, which simplifies to 2:3. The total parts are 2 + 3 = 5. For 40 grams of alloy X:\n- Zinc: \\((6/15) \\times 40 = 16 \\, \\text{g}\\)\n- Copper: \\((9/15) \\times 40 = 24 \\, \\text{g}\\)\n\n### Step 2: Composition of Alloy Y\nAlloy Y has a zinc-to-copper ratio of 7:11.

The question is about finding the ratio of zinc to copper in a new alloy Z made by mixing 40 grams of X and 60 grams of Y. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll need to figure out the amount of zinc and copper in each of the original alloys, X and Y. Let's start with alloy X. The ratio given is 6:9 for zinc to copper. Wait, wait, that's 6 parts zinc to 9 parts copper. So, the total parts for X are 6 + 9 = 15 parts. \n\nBut wait, alloy X is 40 grams when used. So, each part must weigh 40 grams divided by 15. Let me calculate that: 40 /15 is approximately 2.666... grams per part. So, the zinc in X would be 6 parts times that, which is 6 * (40/15) = 16 grams. Similarly, copper in X is 9 * (40/15) = 24 grams. Let me check that: 16 + 24 is 40, which matches. So, X contributes 16g zinc and 24g copper.\n\nNow, onto alloy Y. The ratio is 7:11 for zinc to copper. So, total parts are 7 + 11 = 18. Y is 60 grams in total. So each part is 60/18 = 3.333... grams. Zinc in Y is 7 * (60/18) = 7*(10/3) = 70/3 \u224823.333 grams. Copper is 11*(60/18) = 11*(10/3) = 110/3 \u224836.666 grams. Let me add those: 70/3 + 110/3 = 180/3=60, which checks out. So Y contributes about 23.333g Zn and 36.666g Cu.\n\nNow, when we mix 40g of X and 60g of Y, the total mass of Z is 40+60=100g. But we need the total zinc and copper in Z.\n\nTotal zinc = X's zinc + Y's zinc = 16g + (70/3)g. Let me compute that. 16 is 48/3, so 48/3 +70/3 = 118/3 \u224839.333g. \n\nTotal copper = X's copper + Y's copper =24g + (110/3)g. 24 is 72/3, so 72/3 + 110/3 = 182/3 \u224860.666g.\n\nWait, so the total Zn is 118/3 g and Cu is 182/3 g. To find the ratio, I can write it as (118/3) : (182/3). The denominators are the same, so they cancel out. So the ratio is 118 : 182.\n\nWait, but that can be simplified. Let me see if 118 and 182 have a common divisor. 118 is 2 *59. 182 is 2*91. Oh, wait, 59 is a prime number. So, both are divisible by 2. So dividing both by 2 gives 59:91. So the ratio is 59:91.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 59:91. Option B is 59:91 as well? Wait, no, looking again. Let me check the options:\n\nOptions:\nA)69:91\nB)59:91\nC)59:90\nD)59:91\nE)69:101\n\nWait, I see that both B and D are 59:91. That can't be right. Oh wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the options. Let me read again. Oh, no, the options are:\n\nWait the user wrote the options as:\n\nOptions:\nA)69:91\nB)59:91\nC)59:90\nD)59:91\nE)69:101\n\nWait, so B and D are the same? That's impossible because each option should be unique. Hmm, perhaps it's a typo, but in the question, the options are as presented. So according to my calculation, the ratio is 59:91, which is present in options B and D. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait let me double-check the calculations.\n\nAlloy X: 6:9 ratio. So 6 parts Zn to 9 parts Cu. Total parts 15. 40 grams is X. So each part is 40/15 grams. So Zn in X:6*(40/15)= 16 grams. Correct.\n\nAlloy Y:7:11. Total parts 18. 60 grams. Each part 60/18=10/3 grams. Zn:7*(10/3)=70/3 \u224823.333g. Cu:11*(10/3)=110/3 \u224836.666g. Correct.\n\nTotal Zn: 16 +70/3 = (48 +70)/3 =118/3.\n\nTotal Cu:24 +110/3 = (72 +110)/3=182/3.\n\nRatio Zn:Cu is 118:182. Simplify by dividing by 2: 59:91.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the ratio is 59:91. Looking at the options, both B and D have this. But in the options, B is 59:91 and D is also 59:91. That's probably a mistake, but perhaps I misread the options.\n\nWait, the user wrote:\n\nOptions:\nA)69:91\nB)59:91\nC)59:90\nD)59:91\nE)69:101\n\nWait, so options B and D are same. So perhaps the correct answer is either B or D, but it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait another approach: perhaps the ratio in the question is 6:9 for X, which is 2:3, and Y is 7:11.\n\nSo for X, 40g. So Zn is (2/5)*40 = 16g. Cu is 24g. Correct.\n\nFor Y, 60g, with ratio 7:11. So Zn is (7/18)*60 = 23.333g. Cu is 36.666g. Correct.\n\nTotal Zn:16 +23.333=39.333g. Total Cu:24 +36.666=60.666g.\n\nSo Zn:Cu ratio is 39.333 : 60.666. Let me compute the ratio as fractions. 39.333 is 118/3, 60.666 is 182/3. So 118:182 = 59:91. So the ratio is 59:91.\n\nSo in the options, the correct answer is either B or D, but looking at the options, perhaps the intended correct option is D, but both B and D are same. That's a problem. But perhaps the intended option is D. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, another way to think: perhaps the ratio is mass-based. For each alloy, compute the mass of each metal, then sum.\n\nWait, for X: 40 grams, Zn is (6/15)*40 =16g, Cu 24g. Correct.\n\nY:60 grams. Zn is (7/18)*60= 23.333g, Cu 36.666g.\n\nSo Zn total:16 +23.333=39.333g.\n\nCu total:24 +36.666=60.666g.\n\nSo 39.333:60.666 = (39.333/60.666) = approx 0.6477. To find the exact ratio, 118:182 simplifies by dividing both by 2: 59:91.\n\nSo the ratio is 59:91.\n\nLooking at the options, the correct one is either B or D. But in the options, B is 59:91 and D is same. So perhaps the correct answer is D. But wait, looking at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait another thought: maybe the ratios are in the other way. Wait, the question says X is made by mixing zinc and copper in ratio 6:9. So 6 parts Zn to 9 parts Cu. So that's correct.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the ratios are of Zn to Cu, so when mixing, you can compute the total Zn and Cu.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the percentage of each metal in each alloy.\n\nFor alloy X: Zn is 6/(6+9) = 6/15 = 2/5. So in 40g, Zn is 2/5 *40=16g.\n\nFor Y: Zn is 7/(7+11)=7/18. So in 60g, Zn is (7/18)*60 = 23.333g.\n\nTotal Zn =16 +23.333=39.333g.\n\nCu: in X, it's 9/15=3/5 *40=24g. In Y, 11/18 *60=36.666g. Total Cu=24 +36.666=60.666g.\n\nSo Zn:Cu=39.333:60.666.\n\nMultiply both by 3 to eliminate decimals: 118:182 \u2192 59:91.\n\nSo the ratio is 59:91.\n\nLooking at the options, the correct answer is option D, which is 59:91.\n\nWait, but in the options provided, both B and D are 59:91. That must be a mistake in the options. But perhaps the intended correct answer is D.\n",

So, X contributes 16g zinc and 24g copper.\n\nNow, onto alloy Y. The ratio is 7:11 for zinc to copper. So, total parts are 7 + 11 = 18. Y is 60 grams in total. So each part is 60/18 = 3.333... grams. Zinc in Y is 7 * (60/18) = 7*(10/3) = 70/3 \u224823.333 grams. Copper is 11*(60/18) = 11*(10/3) = 110/3 \u224836.666 grams. Let me add those: 70/3 + 110/3 = 180/3=60, which checks out. So Y contributes about 23.333g Zn and 36.666g Cu.\n\nNow, when we mix 40g of X and 60g of Y, the total mass of Z is 40+60=100g. But we need the total zinc and copper in Z.\n\nTotal zinc = X's zinc + Y's zinc = 16g + (70/3)g. Let me compute that. 16 is 48/3, so 48/3 +70/3 = 118/3 \u224839.333g. \n\nTotal copper = X's copper + Y's copper =24g + (110/3)g. 24 is 72/3, so 72/3 + 110/3 = 182/3 \u224860.666g.\n\nWait, so the total Zn is 118/3 g and Cu is 182/3 g. To find the ratio, I can write it as (118/3) : (182/3). The denominators are the same, so they cancel out. So the ratio is 118 : 182.\n\nWait, but that can be simplified. Let me see if 118 and 182 have a common divisor. 118 is 2 *59. 182 is 2*91. Oh, wait, 59 is a prime number. So, both are divisible by 2. So dividing both by 2 gives 59:91. So the ratio is 59:91.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 59:91. Option B is 59:91 as well? Wait, no, looking again. Let me check the options:\n\nOptions:\nA)69:91\nB)59:91\nC)59:90\nD)59:91\nE)69:101\n\nWait, I see that both B and D are 59:91. That can't be right. Oh wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the options. Let me read again. Oh, no, the options are:\n\nWait the user wrote the options as:\n\nOptions:\nA)69:91\nB)59:91\nC)59:90\nD)59:91\nE)69:101\n\nWait, so B and D are the same? That's impossible because each option should be unique. Hmm, perhaps it's a typo, but in the question, the options are as presented. So according to my calculation, the ratio is 59:91, which is present in options B and D. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait let me double-check the calculations.\n\nAlloy X: 6:9 ratio. So 6 parts Zn to 9 parts Cu. Total parts 15. 40 grams is X. So each part is 40/15 grams. So Zn in X:6*(40/15)= 16 grams. Correct.\n\nAlloy Y:7:11. Total parts 18. 60 grams. Each part 60/18=10/3 grams. Zn:7*(10/3)=70/3 \u224823.333g. Cu:11*(10/3)=110/3 \u224836.666g. Correct.\n\nTotal Zn: 16 +70/3 = (48 +70)/3 =118/3.\n\nTotal Cu:24 +110/3 = (72 +110)/3=182/3.\n\nRatio Zn:Cu is 118:182. Simplify by dividing by 2: 59:91.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the ratio is 59:91. Looking at the options, both B and D have this. But in the options, B is 59:91 and D is also 59:91. That's probably a mistake, but perhaps I misread the options.\n\nWait, the user wrote:\n\nOptions:\nA)69:91\nB)59:91\nC)59:90\nD)59:91\nE)69:101\n\nWait, so options B and D are same. So perhaps the correct answer is either B or D, but it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait another approach: perhaps the ratio in the question is 6:9 for X, which is 2:3, and Y is 7:11.\n\nSo for X, 40g. So Zn is (2/5)*40 = 16g. Cu is 24g. Correct.\n\nFor Y, 60g, with ratio 7:11. So Zn is (7/18)*60 = 23.333g. Cu is 36.666g. Correct.\n\nTotal Zn:16 +23.333=39.333g. Total Cu:24 +36.666=60.666g.\n\nSo Zn:Cu ratio is 39.333 : 60.666. Let me compute the ratio as fractions. 39.333 is 118/3, 60.666 is 182/3. So 118:182 = 59:91. So the ratio is 59:91.\n\nSo in the options, the correct answer is either B or D, but looking at the options, perhaps the intended correct option is D, but both B and D are same. That's a problem. But perhaps the intended option is D. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, another way to think: perhaps the ratio is mass-based. For each alloy, compute the mass of each metal, then sum.\n\nWait, for X: 40 grams, Zn is (6/15)*40 =16g, Cu 24g. Correct.\n\nY:60 grams. Zn is (7/18)*60= 23.333g, Cu 36.666g.\n\nSo Zn total:16 +23.333=39.333g.\n\nCu total:24 +36.666=60.666g.\n\nSo 39.333:60.666 = (39.333/60.666) = approx 0.6477. To find the exact ratio, 118:182 simplifies by dividing both by 2: 59:91.\n\nSo the ratio is 59:91.\n\nLooking at the options, the correct one is either B or D. But in the options, B is 59:91 and D is same. So perhaps the correct answer is D. But wait, looking at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait another thought: maybe the ratios are in the other way. Wait, the question says X is made by mixing zinc and copper in ratio 6:9. So 6 parts Zn to 9 parts Cu. So that's correct.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the ratios are of Zn to Cu, so when mixing, you can compute the total Zn and Cu.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the percentage of each metal in each alloy.\n\nFor alloy X: Zn is 6/(6+9) = 6/15 = 2/5. So in 40g, Zn is 2/5 *40=16g.\n\nFor Y: Zn is 7/(7+11)=7/18. So in 60g, Zn is (7/18)*60 = 23.333g.\n\nTotal Zn =16 +23.333=39.333g.\n\nCu: in X, it's 9/15=3/5 *40=24g. In Y, 11/18 *60=36.666g. Total Cu=24 +36.666=60.666g.\n\nSo Zn:Cu=39.333:60.666.\n\nMultiply both by 3 to eliminate decimals: 118:182 \u2192 59:91.\n\nSo the ratio is 59:91.\n\nLooking at the options, the correct answer is option D, which is 59:91.\n\nWait, but in the options provided, both B and D are 59:91. That must be a mistake in the options. But perhaps the intended correct answer is D.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the ratio of zinc to copper in the new alloy Z, which is formed by mixing 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y. The ratios of zinc to copper in alloys X and Y are given as 6:9 and 7:11, respectively.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Alloy X\n- Alloy X has a zinc-to-copper ratio of **6:9**, which simplifies to **2:3**.\n- The total mass of alloy X is **40 grams**.\n- The total parts in the ratio are \\(6 + 9 = 15\\).\n- Each part weighs \\(\\frac{40}{15} = \\frac{8}{3} \\, \\text{grams}\\).\n- Zinc in X: \\(6 \\times \\frac{8}{3} = 16 \\, \\text{grams}\\).\n- Copper in X: \\(9 \\times \\frac{8}{3} = 24 \\, \\text{grams}\\).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Alloy Y\n- Alloy Y has a zinc-to-copper ratio of **7:11**.\n- The total mass of alloy Y is **60 grams**.\n- The total parts in the ratio are \\(7 + 11 = 18\\).\n- Each part weighs \\(\\frac{60}{18} = \\frac{10}{3} \\, \\text{grams}\\).\n- Zinc in Y: \\(7 \\times \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{70}{3} \\, \\text{grams}\\).\n- Copper in Y: \\(11 \\times \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{110}{3} \\, \\text{grams}\\).\n\n### Step 3: Combine Alloys X and Y\n- Total zinc in alloy Z: \\(16 + \\frac{70}{3} = \\frac{48}{3} + \\frac{70}{3} = \\frac{118}{3} \\, \\text{grams}\\).\n- Total copper in alloy Z: \\(24 + \\frac{110}{3} = \\frac{72}{3} + \\frac{110}{3} = \\frac{182}{3} \\, \\text{grams}\\).\n- The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Zinc:Copper} = \\frac{118}{3} : \\frac{182}{3} = 118 : 182\n  \\]\n- Simplify the ratio by dividing both terms by 2:\n  \\[\n  118 : 182 = 59 : 91\n  \\]\n\n### Step 4: Match with the Options\nThe ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is **59:91**.

Since the options likely intended a single correct answer, the correct choice is **D**.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about alloys made of zinc and copper. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on alloy problems, but I'll try to think it through step by step.\n\nAlright, the question says that X and Y are two alloys. Alloy X is made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9, and Y is 7:11. Then, 40 grams of X and 60 grams of Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z. I need to find the ratio of zinc to copper in Z.\n\nWait, so ratios can sometimes be tricky because they depend on the actual amounts. So I think the approach here is to find out how much zinc and copper are in each alloy, then add them together to get the total for Z.\n\nLet me break it down. For alloy X, the ratio is 6:9. Oh wait, that's zinc to copper. So in X, for every 6 parts of zinc, there are 9 parts of copper. So the total parts for X are 6 + 9 = 15 parts. But wait, the total weight of X is 40 grams. So each part is 40 grams divided by 15. Let me calculate that.\n\nZinc in X: (6/15)*40g = (6 * 40)/15 = 240/15 = 16 grams.\nCopper in X: (9/15)*40g = (9 * 40)/15 = 360/15 = 24 grams.\n\nWait, 16 +24 is 40, which matches the total, so that looks right.\n\nNow onto alloy Y. Its ratio is 7:11. So zinc to copper is 7:11. The total parts here are 7+11=18. The total weight of Y is 60 grams.\n\nZinc in Y: (7/18)*60g = (7 *60)/18 = 420/18. Let me calculate that. 420 divided by 18. Hmm, 18*23=414, so 23.333... grams. Wait, alternatively, 60/18 is 10/3, so 7*(10/3) = 70/3 \u224823.333 grams. Okay.\n\nCopper in Y: (11/18)*60g = (11 *60)/18 = 660/18. 660 divided by 18 is 36.666... grams. Or, again, 60/18 is 10/3, so 11*(10/3) = 110/3 \u224836.666 grams.\n\nSo now, I need to add the zinc from X and Y, and same for copper.\n\nTotal zinc in Z = 16g (from X) + 70/3 g (from Y).\n\nLet me compute that. 16 is 48/3, so 48/3 +70/3 = 118/3 grams. Approximately 39.333 grams.\n\nTotal copper in Z = 24g (from X) + 110/3 g (from Y).\n\n24 is 72/3. So 72/3 +110/3 = 182/3 grams, about 60.666 grams.\n\nSo the ratio of zinc to copper in Z is (118/3) : (182/3). Since the denominators are the same, they cancel out, so it's 118:182.\n\nWait, let me simplify that ratio. Both numbers can be divided by 2. 118 \u00f72=59, 182 \u00f72=91. So the ratio is 59:91.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 59:91. Option B is 59:91 as well? Wait, no, let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA)69:91\nB)59:91\nC)59:90\nD)59:91\nE)69:101\n\nWait, both B and D are 59:91. That can't be right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the options. Let me check the user's question again.\n\nWait the options are:\n\nA)69:91\nB)59:91\nC)59:90\nD)59:91\nE)69:101\n\nHmm, wait, B and D are the same. That's strange. But I think it's a typo, perhaps D is different. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations.\n\nFor alloy X: 40g total, 6:9 ratio. So 40g is 15 parts. Each part is 40/15 = 8/3 grams. So zinc is 6*(8/3) = 16g. Copper 9*(8/3)=24g. That's correct.\n\nAlloy Y: 60g, 7:11 ratio. 18 parts. Each part is 60/18 =10/3 grams. So zinc is 7*(10/3) =70/3 \u224823.333g. Copper 11*(10/3)=110/3 \u224836.666g. Correct.\n\nSo total zinc is 16 +70/3 = (48 +70)/3 =118/3.\n\nTotal copper is 24 +110/3 = (72 +110)/3 =182/3.\n\nSo ratio is 118/3 :182/3. Which simplifies to 118:182. Divide both by 2:59:91.\n\nSo the ratio is 59:91. So the correct option is either B or D, since both are 59:91. But looking back, the options given are:\n\nA)69:91\nB)59:91\nC)59:90\nD)59:91\nE)69:101\n\nWait, both B and D are the same. That must be a mistake. But perhaps the options are correct, and I'm missing something. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait another way: perhaps I should compute the total amounts correctly.\n\nWait, 118/3 is approximately 39.333g of zinc.\n\n182/3 is approximately 60.666g of copper.\n\nSo the ratio is 39.333 : 60.666.\n\nDividing both by 39.333: 1 : (60.666 /39.333) \u2248 1.542.\n\nWait, 59:91 is same as (59/59):(91/59) = 1 : 1.542, which matches. So that's correct.\n\nSo the ratio is 59:91, so the correct option is either B or D.\n\nLooking back, the options have B and D as 59:91. So perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement.\n\nWait, let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe question says 40 grams of X and 60 grams of Y are used. So X is 40g and Y is 60g.\n\nWait, is that correct? Because in the initial step, I used 40g for X and 60g for Y.\n\nYes. So the calculation seems correct.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the options have a typo. But if B and D are same, perhaps the intended correct answer is D. But looking at the options, option D is 59:91, same as B. So perhaps the correct answer is B or D. But looking at the options, perhaps the correct option is D.\n\nWait, but in the options, B and D are same. So perhaps the correct answer is D. But I'm not sure why both B and D are same. Maybe it's a mistake in the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it by finding the amount of each metal in each alloy and then sum them.\n\nAnother approach: For alloy X, which is 40 grams, with ratio 6:9. So the fraction of zinc is 6/(6+9)=6/15=2/5. So zinc in X is 40*(2/5)=16g. Copper is 40*(3/5)=24g.\n\nAlloy Y is 60 grams, ratio 7:11. So fraction of zinc is7/(7+11)=7/18. So zinc is 60*(7/18)= (60/18)*7= (10/3)*7=70/3\u224823.333g.\n\nCopper in Y is 60*(11/18)= (60/18)*11= (10/3)*11=110/3\u224836.666g.\n\nSo total zinc:16 +70/3 = (48 +70)/3=118/3\u224839.333g.\n\nTotal copper:24 +110/3 = (72 +110)/3=182/3\u224860.666g.\n\nSo ratio Zn:Cu is (118/3) : (182/3)= 118:182=59:91.\n\nYes, same as before. So the ratio is 59:91.\n\nLooking back at the options, both B and D are 59:91. So perhaps the correct answer is either B or D, but the options may have a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about it in another way. Maybe I should find the amount of each metal per gram of alloy, and then multiply by the grams.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using alligation method.\n\nWait, the alligation method is used when you mix two solutions of known concentrations to get a final concentration. But in this case, each alloy is a mixture, so maybe alligation can be applied.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me think: alloy X is 40g, Y is 60g.\n\nAlloy X: Zn/Cu ratio 6:9 \u2192 which is 2:3. So the fraction of zinc is 2/5 (0.4), copper is 3/5 (0.6).\n\nAlloy Y: 7:11 \u2192 fraction of Zn is7/18\u22480.3889, copper 11/18\u22480.6111.\n\nWe are mixing 40g of X and 60g of Y. So the total Zn is (2/5)*40 + (7/18)*60.\n\nWhich is 16 + (7/18)*60.\n\nWait, (7/18)*60 = (7*60)/18 = 7*(60/18) =7*(10/3)=70/3 \u224823.333.\n\nSo total Zn is 16 +70/3 = (48 +70)/3=118/3.\n\nSimilarly, total Cu is (3/5)*40 + (11/18)*60=24 + 110/3 = (72 +110)/3=182/3.\n\nSo same result as before. So the ratio is 59:91.\n\nSo the correct answer is 59:91, which is option B and D.\n\nWait, but the options list B and D as same. I must have made a mistake. Let me recheck the options.\n\nOptions:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nSo, options B and D are same. So perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm confused why B and D are same. Maybe the intended answer is D, perhaps a typo in the options. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate the ratio as a fraction, then simplify.\n\nWait, 59:91, let me see if it can be reduced. 59 is a prime number (since 59 \u00f72=29.5, not integer; 59 \u00f73\u224819.666, no; up to sqrt(59)~7.68, so primes up to 7: 59 \u00f75=11.8, 59 \u00f77\u22488.428, so no. So 59 is prime. 91 is 13*7. So 59 and 91 share no common factors. So the ratio is correct as 59:91.\n\nSo the correct answer is either B or D, but looking at the options, both are same. So the correct option must be D. Or perhaps the intended answer is D.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are misnumbered. Because in the options, B is 59:91, D is 59:91. So perhaps the correct answer is D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the ratio in the order of copper to zinc, but the question says \"ratio of zinc and copper\", so Zn:Cu, which is 59:91. So the correct answer is either B or D.\n\nBut looking at the options, the correct answer is 59:91. So the correct option is D.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the total grams.\n\nWait, 40g of X has 16g Zn and 24g Cu.\n\n60g of Y has 70/3 (~23.333g) Zn and 110/3 (~36.666g) Cu.\n\nTotal Zn:16 + 23.333=39.333g.\n\nTotal Cu:24 +36.666=60.666g.\n\nSo 39.333:60.666. Let me multiply both by 3 to eliminate decimals: 118:182.\n\nWhich is 59:91.\n\nSo yes, correct.\n\nSo the answer should be 59:91, which is option D.\n\nBut wait, looking back, option B is also 59:91. So perhaps I should look for a typo in the options.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about alloys made of zinc and copper. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on alloy problems, but I'll try to think it through step by step.\n\nAlright, the question says that X and Y are two alloys. Alloy X is made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9, and Y is 7:11. Then, 40 grams of X and 60 grams of Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z. I need to find the ratio of zinc to copper in Z.\n\nWait, so ratios can sometimes be tricky because they depend on the actual amounts. So I think the approach here is to find out how much zinc and copper are in each alloy, then add them together to get the total for Z.\n\nLet me break it down. For alloy X, the ratio is 6:9. Oh wait, that's zinc to copper. So in X, for every 6 parts of zinc, there are 9 parts of copper. So the total parts for X are 6 + 9 = 15 parts. But wait, the total weight of X is 40 grams. So each part is 40 grams divided by 15. Let me calculate that.\n\nZinc in X: (6/15)*40g = (6 * 40)/15 = 240/15 = 16 grams.\nCopper in X: (9/15)*40g = (9 * 40)/15 = 360/15 = 24 grams.\n\nWait, 16 +24 is 40, which matches the total, so that looks right.\n\nNow onto alloy Y. Its ratio is 7:11. So zinc to copper is 7:11. The total parts here are 7+11=18. The total weight of Y is 60 grams.\n\nZinc in Y: (7/18)*60g = (7 *60)/18 = 420/18. Let me calculate that. 420 divided by 18. Hmm, 18*23=414, so 23.333... grams. Wait, alternatively, 60/18 is 10/3, so 7*(10/3) = 70/3 \u224823.333 grams. Okay.\n\nCopper in Y: (11/18)*60g = (11 *60)/18 = 660/18. 660 divided by 18 is 36.666... grams. Or, again, 60/18 is 10/3, so 11*(10/3) = 110/3 \u224836.666 grams.\n\nSo now, I need to add the zinc from X and Y, and same for copper.\n\nTotal zinc in Z = 16g (from X) + 70/3 g (from Y).\n\nLet me compute that. 16 is 48/3, so 48/3 +70/3 = 118/3 grams. Approximately 39.333 grams.\n\nTotal copper in Z = 24g (from X) + 110/3 g (from Y).\n\n24 is 72/3. So 72/3 +110/3 = 182/3 grams, about 60.666 grams.\n\nSo the ratio of zinc to copper in Z is (118/3) : (182/3). Since the denominators are the same, they cancel out, so it's 118:182.\n\nWait, let me simplify that ratio. Both numbers can be divided by 2. 118 \u00f72=59, 182 \u00f72=91. So the ratio is 59:91.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 59:91. Option B is 59:91 as well? Wait, no, let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA)69:91\nB)59:91\nC)59:90\nD)59:91\nE)69:101\n\nWait, both B and D are 59:91. That can't be right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the options. Let me check the user's question again.\n\nWait the options are:\n\nA)69:91\nB)59:91\nC)59:90\nD)59:91\nE)69:101\n\nHmm, wait, B and D are the same. That's strange. But I think it's a typo, perhaps D is different. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations.\n\nFor alloy X: 40g total, 6:9 ratio. So 40g is 15 parts. Each part is 40/15 = 8/3 grams. So zinc is 6*(8/3) = 16g. Copper 9*(8/3)=24g. That's correct.\n\nAlloy Y: 60g, 7:11 ratio. 18 parts. Each part is 60/18 =10/3 grams. So zinc is 7*(10/3) =70/3 \u224823.333g. Copper 11*(10/3)=110/3 \u224836.666g. Correct.\n\nSo total zinc is 16 +70/3 = (48 +70)/3 =118/3.\n\nTotal copper is 24 +110/3 = (72 +110)/3 =182/3.\n\nSo ratio is 118/3 :182/3. Which simplifies to 118:182. Divide both by 2:59:91.\n\nSo the ratio is 59:91. So the correct option is either B or D, since both are 59:91. But looking back, the options given are:\n\nA)69:91\nB)59:91\nC)59:90\nD)59:91\nE)69:101\n\nWait, both B and D are the same. That must be a mistake. But perhaps the options are correct, and I'm missing something. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait another way: perhaps I should compute the total amounts correctly.\n\nWait, 118/3 is approximately 39.333g of zinc.\n\n182/3 is approximately 60.666g of copper.\n\nSo the ratio is 39.333 : 60.666.\n\nDividing both by 39.333: 1 : (60.666 /39.333) \u2248 1.542.\n\nWait, 59:91 is same as (59/59):(91/59) = 1 : 1.542, which matches. So that's correct.\n\nSo the ratio is 59:91, so the correct option is either B or D.\n\nLooking back, the options have B and D as 59:91. So perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement.\n\nWait, let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe question says 40 grams of X and 60 grams of Y are used. So X is 40g and Y is 60g.\n\nWait, is that correct? Because in the initial step, I used 40g for X and 60g for Y.\n\nYes. So the calculation seems correct.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the options have a typo. But if B and D are same, perhaps the intended correct answer is D. But looking at the options, option D is 59:91, same as B. So perhaps the correct answer is B or D. But looking at the options, perhaps the correct option is D.\n\nWait, but in the options, B and D are same. So perhaps the correct answer is D. But I'm not sure why both B and D are same. Maybe it's a mistake in the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it by finding the amount of each metal in each alloy and then sum them.\n\nAnother approach: For alloy X, which is 40 grams, with ratio 6:9. So the fraction of zinc is 6/(6+9)=6/15=2/5. So zinc in X is 40*(2/5)=16g. Copper is 40*(3/5)=24g.\n\nAlloy Y is 60 grams, ratio 7:11. So fraction of zinc is7/(7+11)=7/18. So zinc is 60*(7/18)= (60/18)*7= (10/3)*7=70/3\u224823.333g.\n\nCopper in Y is 60*(11/18)= (60/18)*11= (10/3)*11=110/3\u224836.666g.\n\nSo total zinc:16 +70/3 = (48 +70)/3=118/3\u224839.333g.\n\nTotal copper:24 +110/3 = (72 +110)/3=182/3\u224860.666g.\n\nSo ratio Zn:Cu is (118/3) : (182/3)= 118:182=59:91.\n\nYes, same as before. So the ratio is 59:91.\n\nLooking back at the options, both B and D are 59:91. So perhaps the correct answer is either B or D, but the options may have a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about it in another way. Maybe I should find the amount of each metal per gram of alloy, and then multiply by the grams.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using alligation method.\n\nWait, the alligation method is used when you mix two solutions of known concentrations to get a final concentration. But in this case, each alloy is a mixture, so maybe alligation can be applied.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me think: alloy X is 40g, Y is 60g.\n\nAlloy X: Zn/Cu ratio 6:9 \u2192 which is 2:3. So the fraction of zinc is 2/5 (0.4), copper is 3/5 (0.6).\n\nAlloy Y: 7:11 \u2192 fraction of Zn is7/18\u22480.3889, copper 11/18\u22480.6111.\n\nWe are mixing 40g of X and 60g of Y. So the total Zn is (2/5)*40 + (7/18)*60.\n\nWhich is 16 + (7/18)*60.\n\nWait, (7/18)*60 = (7*60)/18 = 7*(60/18) =7*(10/3)=70/3 \u224823.333.\n\nSo total Zn is 16 +70/3 = (48 +70)/3=118/3.\n\nSimilarly, total Cu is (3/5)*40 + (11/18)*60=24 + 110/3 = (72 +110)/3=182/3.\n\nSo same result as before. So the ratio is 59:91.\n\nSo the correct answer is 59:91, which is option B and D.\n\nWait, but the options list B and D as same. I must have made a mistake. Let me recheck the options.\n\nOptions:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nSo, options B and D are same. So perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm confused why B and D are same. Maybe the intended answer is D, perhaps a typo in the options. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate the ratio as a fraction, then simplify.\n\nWait, 59:91, let me see if it can be reduced. 59 is a prime number (since 59 \u00f72=29.5, not integer; 59 \u00f73\u224819.666, no; up to sqrt(59)~7.68, so primes up to 7: 59 \u00f75=11.8, 59 \u00f77\u22488.428, so no. So 59 is prime. 91 is 13*7. So 59 and 91 share no common factors. So the ratio is correct as 59:91.\n\nSo the correct answer is either B or D, but looking at the options, both are same. So the correct option must be D. Or perhaps the intended answer is D.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are misnumbered. Because in the options, B is 59:91, D is 59:91. So perhaps the correct answer is D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the ratio in the order of copper to zinc, but the question says \"ratio of zinc and copper\", so Zn:Cu, which is 59:91. So the correct answer is either B or D.\n\nBut looking at the options, the correct answer is 59:91. So the correct option is D.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the total grams.\n\nWait, 40g of X has 16g Zn and 24g Cu.\n\n60g of Y has 70/3 (~23.333g) Zn and 110/3 (~36.666g) Cu.\n\nTotal Zn:16 + 23.333=39.333g.\n\nTotal Cu:24 +36.666=60.666g.\n\nSo 39.333:60.666. Let me multiply both by 3 to eliminate decimals: 118:182.\n\nWhich is 59:91.\n\nSo yes, correct.\n\nSo the answer should be 59:91, which is option D.\n\nBut wait, looking back, option B is also 59:91. So perhaps I should look for a typo in the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the ratio as (total Zn) : (total Cu) = (118/3) : (182/3) \u2192 118:182 \u2192 59:91.\n\nYes, same result.\n\nSo the correct option is 59:91, which is options B and D. But that's not possible, as they are same. So perhaps the intended answer is D.\n\nSo the answer is D.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we calculate the amount of zinc and copper in each alloy (X and Y) based on their given ratios and total weights, then combine these amounts to determine the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Alloy X\n- Alloy X has a zinc-to-copper ratio of **6:9**, which simplifies to **2:3**.\n- The total weight of alloy X is **40 g**.\n- The total parts in the ratio are \\( 6 + 9 = 15 \\).\n- Each part weighs \\( \\frac{40}{15} = \\frac{8}{3} \\, \\text{g} \\).\n- Zinc in X: \\( 6 \\times \\frac{8}{3} = 16 \\, \\text{g} \\).\n- Copper in X: \\( 9 \\times \\frac{8}{3} = 24 \\, \\text{g} \\).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Alloy Y\n- Alloy Y has a zinc-to-copper ratio of **7:11**.\n- The total weight of alloy Y is **60 g**.\n- The total parts in the ratio are \\( 7 + 11 = 18 \\).\n- Each part weighs \\( \\frac{60}{18} = \\frac{10}{3} \\, \\text{g} \\).\n- Zinc in Y: \\( 7 \\times \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{70}{3} \\, \\text{g} \\).\n- Copper in Y: \\( 11 \\times \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{110}{3} \\, \\text{g} \\).\n\n### Step 3: Combine Alloys X and Y\n- Total zinc in alloy Z: \\( 16 + \\frac{70}{3} = \\frac{48}{3} + \\frac{70}{3} = \\frac{118}{3} \\, \\text{g} \\).\n- Total copper in alloy Z: \\( 24 + \\frac{110}{3} = \\frac{72}{3} + \\frac{110}{3} = \\frac{182}{3} \\, \\text{g} \\).\n\n### Step 4: Simplify the Ratio\n- The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\frac{118}{3}}{\\frac{182}{3}} = \\frac{118}{182}\n  \\]\n- Simplify \\( \\frac{118}{182} \\) by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{118 \\div 2}{182 \\div 2} = \\frac{59}{91}\n  \\]\n- Thus, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is **59:91**.\n\n### Step 5: Match with Options\n- Among the given options, **59:91** corresponds to **B** and **D**.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about alloys made from zinc and copper, and I need to find the ratio of zinc to copper in the resulting alloy Z. Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nAlright, the problem says that alloy X has zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9, and alloy Y has a ratio of 7:11. Then, they take 40 grams of X and 60 grams of Y, melt them, and mix them to make alloy Z. I need to find the new ratio of zinc to copper in Z.\n\nWait, ratios can be a bit tricky. I remember that when you mix two things, you have to calculate the total amount of each component from both sources. So, first, I should probably find out how much zinc and copper are in each of the 40 grams of X and 60 grams of Y.\n\nStarting with alloy X. The ratio is 6:9, which I think simplifies to 2:3, but maybe I should keep it as 6:9 for calculation purposes. So, for alloy X, the total parts are 6+9 = 15 parts. Each part would be 40g divided by 15. Wait, no, that's not right. Because 40 grams is the total mass of alloy X. So the mass of each part would be 40g divided by 15 parts.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. The ratio is 6 parts zinc to 9 parts copper in X. So each part is (6+9) =15 parts. So each part is 40g /15. So zinc in X is 6 parts, so 6*(40/15) grams. Let me calculate that.\n\nZinc in X: 6*(40/15) = (6*40)/15. Let me compute that. 6 divided by 15 is 0.4, so 0.4*40=16 grams of zinc. Or wait, 40 divided by 15 is approximately 2.666... so 6 times that is 16 grams. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nCopper in X would be 9*(40/15) = 9*(8/3) since 40/15 is 8/3. 9*(8/3) is (9/3)*8 = 3*8 =24 grams of copper. So in X, 16g Zn and 24g Cu.\n\nNow for alloy Y. The ratio is 7:11, so total parts are 7+11=18. The mass of Y is 60 grams. So each part is 60/18 grams. Zinc is 7 parts, copper 11 parts.\n\nZinc in Y: 7*(60/18). Let me calculate that. 60/18 is 10/3 \u22483.333. 7*(10/3) = 70/3 \u224823.333 grams.\n\nCopper in Y: 11*(60/18) = 11*(10/3) = 110/3 \u224836.666 grams.\n\nSo now, when we mix X and Y, the total zinc is X's zinc plus Y's zinc, and same for copper.\n\nTotal zinc = 16 + 70/3. Let me compute that. 16 is 48/3, so 48/3 +70/3 = 118/3 grams.\n\nTotal copper =24 + 110/3. 24 is 72/3, so 72/3 +110/3 = 182/3 grams.\n\nWait, so the total mass of alloy Z is (118/3 + 182/3) = 300/3=100 grams. That makes sense because 40+60=100g.\n\nNow, the ratio of zinc to copper is (118/3) : (182/3). Since both have the same denominator, I can ignore the denominator and just take 118:182.\n\nWait, but I should simplify that ratio. Let me see if 118 and 182 have a common factor. Let's see: 118 is 2*59. 182 is 2*91. Oh, so both are divisible by 2. So dividing both by 2, we get 59:91.\n\nWait, so the ratio is 59:91. Looking at the options, option D is 59:91. But wait, let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, wait. Let me recalculate the totals again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nIn X: 40g. Zinc is (6/15)*40 = (2/5)*40=16g. Copper (9/15)*40= (3/5)*40=24g. That's correct.\n\nIn Y: 60g. Zinc is (7/18)*60 = (7*60)/18 = (7*10)/3 =70/3 \u224823.333g. Copper is (11/18)*60= (11*10)/3=110/3\u224836.666g.\n\nAdding up: Zinc: 16 +70/3 = 48/3 +70/3=118/3. Copper:24 +110/3=72/3 +110/3=182/3.\n\nSo ratio is 118/3 :182/3 \u2192 118:182 \u2192 divide both by 2 \u219259:91. So option D.\n\nWait, looking at the options, option D is 59:91, which matches. So the answer should be D.\n",

Then, they take 40 grams of X and 60 grams of Y, melt them, and mix them to make alloy Z. I need to find the new ratio of zinc to copper in Z.\n\nWait, ratios can be a bit tricky. I remember that when you mix two things, you have to calculate the total amount of each component from both sources. So, first, I should probably find out how much zinc and copper are in each of the 40 grams of X and 60 grams of Y.\n\nStarting with alloy X. The ratio is 6:9, which I think simplifies to 2:3, but maybe I should keep it as 6:9 for calculation purposes. So, for alloy X, the total parts are 6+9 = 15 parts. Each part would be 40g divided by 15. Wait, no, that's not right. Because 40 grams is the total mass of alloy X. So the mass of each part would be 40g divided by 15 parts.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. The ratio is 6 parts zinc to 9 parts copper in X. So each part is (6+9) =15 parts. So each part is 40g /15. So zinc in X is 6 parts, so 6*(40/15) grams. Let me calculate that.\n\nZinc in X: 6*(40/15) = (6*40)/15. Let me compute that. 6 divided by 15 is 0.4, so 0.4*40=16 grams of zinc. Or wait, 40 divided by 15 is approximately 2.666... so 6 times that is 16 grams. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nCopper in X would be 9*(40/15) = 9*(8/3) since 40/15 is 8/3. 9*(8/3) is (9/3)*8 = 3*8 =24 grams of copper. So in X, 16g Zn and 24g Cu.\n\nNow for alloy Y. The ratio is 7:11, so total parts are 7+11=18. The mass of Y is 60 grams. So each part is 60/18 grams. Zinc is 7 parts, copper 11 parts.\n\nZinc in Y: 7*(60/18). Let me calculate that. 60/18 is 10/3 \u22483.333. 7*(10/3) = 70/3 \u224823.333 grams.\n\nCopper in Y: 11*(60/18) = 11*(10/3) = 110/3 \u224836.666 grams.\n\nSo now, when we mix X and Y, the total zinc is X's zinc plus Y's zinc, and same for copper.\n\nTotal zinc = 16 + 70/3. Let me compute that. 16 is 48/3, so 48/3 +70/3 = 118/3 grams.\n\nTotal copper =24 + 110/3. 24 is 72/3, so 72/3 +110/3 = 182/3 grams.\n\nWait, so the total mass of alloy Z is (118/3 + 182/3) = 300/3=100 grams. That makes sense because 40+60=100g.\n\nNow, the ratio of zinc to copper is (118/3) : (182/3). Since both have the same denominator, I can ignore the denominator and just take 118:182.\n\nWait, but I should simplify that ratio. Let me see if 118 and 182 have a common factor. Let's see: 118 is 2*59. 182 is 2*91. Oh, so both are divisible by 2. So dividing both by 2, we get 59:91.\n\nWait, so the ratio is 59:91. Looking at the options, option D is 59:91. But wait, let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, wait. Let me recalculate the totals again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nIn X: 40g. Zinc is (6/15)*40 = (2/5)*40=16g. Copper (9/15)*40= (3/5)*40=24g. That's correct.\n\nIn Y: 60g. Zinc is (7/18)*60 = (7*60)/18 = (7*10)/3 =70/3 \u224823.333g. Copper is (11/18)*60= (11*10)/3=110/3\u224836.666g.\n\nAdding up: Zinc: 16 +70/3 = 48/3 +70/3=118/3. Copper:24 +110/3=72/3 +110/3=182/3.\n\nSo ratio is 118/3 :182/3 \u2192 118:182 \u2192 divide both by 2 \u219259:91. So option D.\n\nWait, looking at the options, option D is 59:91, which matches. So the answer should be D.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we calculate the amount of zinc and copper in alloys X and Y, then determine the total amounts in alloy Z. \n\n### Step 1: Analyze alloy X\nAlloy X has a zinc-to-copper ratio of 6:9, which simplifies to 2:3.
