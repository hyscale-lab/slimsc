      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty on my stats, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.\n\nThe problem says that there's a 90% chance a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election. So, each voter has a 0.9 probability of having voted. Now, the question is about choosing five registered voters at random and finding the approximate likelihood that exactly four of them voted. \n\nHmm, this sounds like a binomial probability problem. Yeah, because each trial (voter) is independent, and we're looking for a specific number of successes (voted) in a fixed number of trials.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k), where C(n,k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.\n\nIn this case, n is 5, k is 4. p is 0.9. So let me plug these numbers in.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate C(5,4). C(n,k) is n!/(k!(n-k)! ). So 5!/(4!1!) = (5*4*3*2*1)/( (4*3*2*1)*(1) ) = 120/(24*1) )= 5. So that's 5.\n\nNext, p^k is (0.9)^4. Let me compute that. 0.9^4 is 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9. Let's see: 0.81 * 0.81 is 0.6561. Wait, no, wait. 0.9 squared is 0.81, cubed is 0.729, to the fourth is 0.6561. Yeah.\n\nThen, (1-p)^(n-k) is (0.1)^(5-4) = 0.1^1 = 0.1.\n\nSo putting it all together: P(4) = 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1.\n\nLet me calculate that. 5 multiplied by 0.6561 is 3.2805, then multiply by 0.1 gives 0.32805. So that's approximately 0.328, which is 32.8%.\n\nWait, let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The combination part: 5 choose 4 is definitely 5. The p^4 is correct as 0.6561. 0.1 is correct. So 5 * 0.6561 is 3.2805, times 0.1 is 0.32805, which is 32.8%. So looking at the options, option B is 32.8%. \n\nBut wait, another way to think: since the probability is high (90%), getting four out of five would be pretty common, but five would be even more likely. But the question is about exactly four, which is less than all five. So the probability should be lower than the probability of all five voting.\n\nWhat's the probability of all five voting? That would be (0.9)^5. Let's compute that: 0.9^5 is approximately 0.59049, which is about 59.05%. So the option D is 59.0%, which is the probability of all five. So our calculation for four is 32.8%, which is option B.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. So the answer should be option B.\n",

So, each voter has a probability of 0.9 of having voted. Now, the question is asking, if I randomly choose five registered voters, what's the approximate likelihood that exactly four of them voted in the last election? The options are A to E.\n\nHmm, I remember this is a binomial probability problem. Because each trial (voter) is independent, has two outcomes (voted or not), and the probability is the same each time. So the binomial formula should apply here.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k). Where C(n,k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time, p is the probability of success, and n is the number of trials.\n\nIn this case, n is 5 because we're choosing five voters. We want exactly four to have voted, so k is 4. The probability of voting (success) is 0.9, and the probability of not voting is 0.1.\n\nSo let me plug in the numbers. First, I need to calculate C(5,4). C(5,4) is the number of ways to choose 4 successes out of 5 trials. I remember that C(n,k) = n!/(k! (n-k)!).\n\nCalculating C(5,4): 5!/(4! * (5-4)!) = (5*4*3*2*1)/(4*3*2*1 * 1) = 5/1 =5. So that part is 5.\n\nNext, p^k is (0.9)^4. Let me compute that. 0.9^4 is 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9. Let's see: 0.9 squared is 0.81. Squared again, 0.81^2 is 0.6561. So 0.9^4 is 0.6561.\n\nThen, (1-p)^(n-k) is (0.1)^(5-4) which is 0.1^1 = 0.1.\n\nNow, multiply all these together: 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1.\n\nLet me compute that step by step.

Yes, C(5,4) is definitely 5. And the exponents for p and (1-p) are correct\u20144 and 1 respectively.

Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe problem says there's a 90% chance that a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election. We're supposed to find the approximate likelihood that exactly four out of five randomly chosen voters voted. The options are A to E, with percentages ranging from about 26% to 65%.\n\nHmm, right. So this seems like a binomial probability problem. Because each voter is an independent trial with two possible outcomes: voted (success) or didn't vote (failure). \n\nWait, what's the binomial formula again? I think it's P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k). Where n is the number of trials, k is the number of successes, and p is the probability of success.\n\nIn this case, n is 5, because we're choosing five voters. We're looking for exactly four who voted, so k is 4. The probability p is 0.9, since each has a 90% chance of voting.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers: P(4) = C(5,4) * (0.9)^4 * (0.1)^(5-4). \n\nWait, what's C(5,4)? That's the combination of 5 things taken 4 at a time. I remember that C(n,k) is n!/(k! (n-k)!)). So 5!/(4! *1!) = (5*4*3*2*1)/( (4*3*2*1) * 1 ) )= 5/1 =5. Oh right, because there are five ways to choose which four are the ones who voted.\n\nSo C(5,4) is 5.\n\nNow, (0.9)^4. Let me calculate that. 0.9 * 0.9 is 0.81, then 0.81 *0.9 is 0.729, times another 0.9 is 0.6561. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 0.9^4. Let me think again. 0.9^1 is 0.9. 0.9^2 is 0.81. 0.9^3 is 0.729. 0.9^4 is 0.6561, right.\n\nThen (0.1)^(5-4) is 0.1^1, which is 0.1.\n\nPutting it all together: 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1. Let me compute that. 0.6561 multiplied by 0.1 is 0.06561. Then multiply by 5: 5 * 0.06561 = 0.32805.\n\nSo that's 0.32805, which is approximately 32.8%.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 32.8%. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations. Did I compute the exponents correctly? Let me redo 0.9^4.\n\n0.9 *0.9 = 0.81. 0.81 *0.9 = 0.729. 0.729 *0.9 = 0.6561. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAnd 0.1^1 is 0.1. So 0.6561 *0.1 is 0.06561. Multiply by 5, which is 0.32805, so 32.8%. That's right.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the probability that exactly four voted is the number of ways to choose which four voted times the probability each voted times the probability the fifth didn't. Which is exactly what I did.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. So yeah, the answer is B.\n",

We're supposed to find the approximate likelihood that exactly four out of five randomly chosen voters voted. The options are A to E, with percentages ranging from about 26% to 65%.\n\nHmm, right. So this seems like a binomial probability problem. Because each voter is an independent trial with two possible outcomes: voted (success) or didn't vote (failure). \n\nWait, what's the binomial formula again? I think it's P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k). Where n is the number of trials, k is the number of successes, and p is the probability of success.\n\nIn this case, n is 5, because we're choosing five voters. We're looking for exactly four who voted, so k is 4. The probability p is 0.9, since each has a 90% chance of voting.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers: P(4) = C(5,4) * (0.9)^4 * (0.1)^(5-4). \n\nWait, what's C(5,4)? That's the combination of 5 things taken 4 at a time. I remember that C(n,k) is n!/(k! (n-k)!)). So 5!/(4! *1!) = (5*4*3*2*1)/( (4*3*2*1) * 1 ) )= 5/1 =5. Oh right, because there are five ways to choose which four are the ones who voted.\n\nSo C(5,4) is 5.\n\nNow, (0.9)^4. Let me calculate that. 0.9 * 0.9 is 0.81, then 0.81 *0.9 is 0.729, times another 0.9 is 0.6561. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 0.9^4. Let me think again. 0.9^1 is 0.9. 0.9^2 is 0.81. 0.9^3 is 0.729. 0.9^4 is 0.6561, right.\n\nThen (0.1)^(5-4) is 0.1^1, which is 0.1.\n\nPutting it all together: 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1. Let me compute that. 0.6561 multiplied by 0.1 is 0.06561. Then multiply by 5: 5 * 0.06561 = 0.32805.\n\nSo that's 0.32805, which is approximately 32.8%.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 32.8%. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations. Did I compute the exponents correctly? Let me redo 0.9^4.\n\n0.9 *0.9 = 0.81. 0.81 *0.9 = 0.729. 0.729 *0.9 = 0.6561. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAnd 0.1^1 is 0.1. So 0.6561 *0.1 is 0.06561. Multiply by 5, which is 0.32805, so 32.8%. That's right.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the probability that exactly four voted is the number of ways to choose which four voted times the probability each voted times the probability the fifth didn't. Which is exactly what I did.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. So yeah, the answer is B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we recognize it as a binomial probability question. Each voter is an independent trial with two outcomes: voted (success) or did not vote (failure). The probability of success, \\( p \\), is 0.9, and the number of trials, \\( n \\), is 5. We are tasked with finding the probability of exactly \\( k = 4 \\) successes.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is:\n\n\\[\nP(k) = \\binom{n}{k} \\cdot p^k \\cdot (1-p)^{n-k}\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the combination\nThe combination \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\) represents the number of ways to choose \\( k \\) successes out of \\( n \\) trials. For \\( \\binom{5}{4} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{5}{4} = \\frac{5!}{4!(5-4)!} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1}{(4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1) \\cdot 1} = 5\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate \\( p^k \\)\n\\[\np^4 = 0.9^4 = 0.9 \\cdot 0.9 \\cdot 0.9 \\cdot 0.9 = 0.6561\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate \\( (1-p)^{n-k} \\)\n\\[\n(1-p)^{5-4} = 0.1^1 = 0.1\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Combine the results\n\\[\nP(4) = \\binom{5}{4} \\cdot 0.9^4 \\cdot 0.1 = 5 \\cdot 0.6561 \\cdot 0.1 = 5 \\cdot 0.06561 = 0.32805\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Convert to percentage\n\\[\n0.32805 \\approx 32.8\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, the approximate likelihood that exactly four out of five randomly chosen voters voted in the last election is **32.8%**, which corresponds to option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

But let's try to work through it step by step.\n\nAlright, the question says that there's a 90% chance a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election. So, that means each individual has a 0.9 probability of having voted. Now, the problem is asking about the likelihood that exactly four out of five randomly chosen voters voted. Hmm, okay, so this sounds like a binomial probability question.\n\nWait, binomial distribution is when there are a fixed number of independent trials, each with two possible outcomes, right? Like success or failure. In this case, each voter either voted (success) or didn't (failure). So yeah, that fits.\n\nThe formula for binomial probability is P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k), where C(n,k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time. Let me make sure I remember that correctly. Oh right, C(n,k) is n choose k, which is n!/(k!(n-k)!).\n\nSo in this problem, n is 5 because we're choosing five voters. We want exactly four to have voted, so k is 4. The probability of success, p, is 0.9, and the probability of failure is 1-p, which is 0.1.\n\nLet me plug the numbers into the formula. First, calculate C(5,4). That's 5!/(4!*(5-4)!) = (5*4*3*2*1)/( (4*3*2*1) * 1! ) = 5/1 = 5. Oh, right, because 5 choose 4 is 5.\n\nNext, p^k is (0.9)^4. Let me calculate that. 0.9^4. 0.9 squared is 0.81, and then squared again would be 0.81 * 0.81. Let me compute that: 0.81 * 0.81. Hmm, 0.8 * 0.8 is 0.64, and the rest would be 0.01 * 0.8 + 0.8 * 0.01 + 0.01 * 0.01. Wait, maybe I should just multiply it out. 81 * 81 = 6561, so 0.81^2 is 0.6561. So 0.9^4 is 0.6561.\n\nThen (1-p)^(n-k) is (0.1)^(5-4) = 0.1^1 = 0.1.\n\nNow, putting it all together: 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1. Let's calculate that. 5 times 0.6561 is 3.2805, and then multiplied by 0.1 gives 0.32805. So 0.32805 is the probability.\n\nWait, what's that as a percentage? Oh, I just multiply by 100. So 0.32805 * 100 = 32.805%. Looking at the options, option B is 32.8%, which matches.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might mix up exponents or combinations.\n\nC(5,4) is definitely 5, right? Yeah, because choosing 4 out of 5, which can be done in 5 ways. So that's correct.\n\n0.9^4: Let me compute that again. 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81. Then 0.81 * 0.9 = 0.729. Then 0.729 * 0.9 = 0.6561. Yep, that's right.\n\n0.1^1 is 0.1, so 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1 is 5 * 0.06561. Oh, wait a second, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Because 0.6561 * 0.1 is 0.06561. Then 5 * 0.06561 is 0.32805, which is 32.805%.

C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time. So for n=5 and k=4, that's 5 choose 4. \n\nCalculating that: 5! / (4! * (5-4)!) = (5*4*3*2*1)/( (4*3*2*1)*(1) ) = 5/1 =5.\n\nSo the combination part is 5. \n\nNext, p^k is (0.9)^4.

But since the question is only about exactly four, I don't need to sum here. \n\nSo yeah, I'm confident the answer is option B, 32.8%.\n\n\nTo determine the likelihood that exactly four out of five randomly chosen registered voters from Burghtown voted in the last election, we use the binomial probability formula:\n\n\\[\nP = C(n, k) \\cdot p^k \\cdot (1-p)^{n-k}\n\\]\n\nHere:\n- \\( n = 5 \\) (total number of trials),\n- \\( k = 4 \\) (number of successes, i.e., voters who voted),\n- \\( p = 0.9 \\) (probability of success for each trial).\n\n### Step 1: Calculate \\( C(5, 4) \\)\n\\[\nC(5, 4) = \\frac{5!}{4!(5-4)!} = 5\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate \\( p^k \\)\n\\[\np^k = 0.9^4 = 0.9 \\cdot 0.9 \\cdot 0.9 \\cdot 0.9 = 0.6561\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate \\( (1-p)^{n-k} \\)\n\\[\n(1-p)^{n-k} = 0.1^{5-4} = 0.1^1 = 0.1\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Combine the results\n\\[\nP = C(5, 4) \\cdot p^k \\cdot (1-p)^{n-k} = 5 \\cdot 0.6561 \\cdot 0.1\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( 5 \\cdot 0.6561 \\):\n\\[\n5 \\cdot 0.6561 = 3.2805\n\\]\n\nThen multiply by \\( 0.1 \\):\n\\[\n3.2805 \\cdot 0.1 = 0.32805\n\\]\n\nConvert to a percentage:\n\\[\n0.32805 \\times 100 = 32.805\\%\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe approximate likelihood is **32.8%**, which corresponds to option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",
