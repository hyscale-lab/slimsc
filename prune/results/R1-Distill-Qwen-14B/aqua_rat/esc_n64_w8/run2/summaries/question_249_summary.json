      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says: What is the sum of three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727 + 728 + 729.\n\nWait, no, actually, let me parse that again. Oh, wait, no, the product is 727 + 728 + 729? Or is the product equal to that sum? Hmm, the wording says \"can be expressed as 727+728+729.\" Oh, wait, no, that's not right. Because 727+728+729 is a sum, but the product is being equated to that sum? That doesn't make much sense because the product of three numbers would be a much larger number than their sum. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me read the question again. The product can be expressed as 727 + 728 + 729. So the product of the three consecutive integers is equal to 727 + 728 + 729. Oh, okay, that makes more sense.\n\nSo first, I need to compute 727 + 728 + 729. Let me calculate that. 727 + 728 is 1455, and adding 729 gives me 2184. So the product of the three consecutive integers is 2184.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, 727 plus 728 is 1455, then 1455 + 729. Let's compute that: 1455 + 700 is 2155, plus 29 is 2184. So yes, the product is 2184.\n\nSo the problem is to find three consecutive integers whose product is 2184. Then, once I find those integers, I need to find their sum.\n\nLet me denote the three consecutive integers as n-1, n, and n+1. Their product is (n-1)*n*(n+1) = n(n\u00b2 - 1) = 2184.\n\nSo, n(n\u00b2 - 1) = 2184. Hmm, I can rewrite this as n\u00b3 - n = 2184. So n\u00b3 - n - 2184 = 0.\n\nI need to solve this cubic equation. Maybe I can find an integer n that satisfies this.\n\nAlternatively, I can approximate the cube root of 2184 to get an idea of where to look. Let's see, the cube of 12 is 1728, 13 cubed is 2197. Oh, wait, 13 cubed is 2197. So 2197 is very close to 2184. So n is probably around 12 or 13.\n\nWait, let's check n=12: 12*13*14 = let's compute that. 12*13 is 156, 156*14 is 2184. Yes! So that's the product. So the three consecutive integers are 12,13,14. Their sum is 12+13+14=39.\n\nWait, but wait a second, the problem says \"three consecutive integers\", so they could be either positive or negative. But in this case, since the product is positive, the integers are either all positive or all negative. Since 727,728,729 are all positive, the product is positive, so the three integers must be positive. So 12,13,14 are the numbers.\n\nSo the sum is 12+13+14=39. Looking at the options, option E is 39.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me compute 12*13*14 again. 12*13 is 156, 156*14: 156*10=1560, 156*4=624. 1560+624=2184. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the sum is 39, which is option E.\n",

So I'm looking for three consecutive numbers whose product is 2184, and then I need to find their sum.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the sum of those three consecutive integers.

Let's think about possible values of n.\n\nI can try to find the cube root of 2184 to approximate where n might be. The cube root of 2184 is approximately 13, because 12^3 is 1728, 13^3 is 2197.

So, let me find three consecutive numbers whose product is 2184.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of three consecutive integers equals 2184, and then find their sum.\n\nSo, the question is, find three consecutive integers a, a+1, a+2, such that a*(a+1)*(a+2) = 2184.

Again, 1092/2 is 546. 546/2 is 273. 273 divided by 3 is 91. 91 is 7*13. So the prime factors are 2^3 *3 *7 *13.\n\nLooking for three consecutive numbers.

Let's compute that. 150*14 is 2100, 6*14=84. So 2100+84=2184. Oh, that's exactly it! So the three consecutive integers are 12, 13, 14.

Let's see, if I take negative numbers, would that product be positive? Since three negative numbers multiplied would be negative. So no, because 2184 is positive. So the numbers must all be positive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a triplet lower than 12. Let me try 10,11,12: 10*11=110, 110*12=1320. That's way less than 2184. 11*12*13= 1716.

So, let me find three consecutive numbers whose product is 2184.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of three consecutive integers equals 2184, and then find their sum.\n\nSo, the question is, find three consecutive integers a, a+1, a+2, such that a*(a+1)*(a+2) = 2184. Then, the sum would be a + (a+1) + (a+2) = 3a +3 = 3(a+1). So, once I find 'a', I can compute the sum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can factor 2184 to find possible consecutive integers.\n\nWait, let me try to factor 2184. Hmm, 2184 divided by 2 is 1092. Again, 1092/2 is 546. 546/2 is 273. 273 divided by 3 is 91. 91 is 7*13. So the prime factors are 2^3 *3 *7 *13.\n\nLooking for three consecutive numbers. Let me think of possible numbers around the cube root of 2184. Cube root of 2184 is approximately 12.9, so maybe around 12 or 13.\n\nLet me try 12: 12*13*14. 12*13 is 156, times 14: 156 *14. Let's compute that. 150*14 is 2100, 6*14=84. So 2100+84=2184. Oh, that's exactly it! So the three consecutive integers are 12, 13, 14. Their product is 2184.\n\nSo, the sum of these integers is 12 +13 +14. 12+13 is 25, plus 14 is 39. So the sum is 39. Looking at the options, E is 39. So the answer should be E.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure there are no other possible triplets. Because sometimes, with negative numbers, there could be another set. Let me check. Let's see, if I take negative numbers, would that product be positive? Since three negative numbers multiplied would be negative. So no, because 2184 is positive. So the numbers must all be positive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a triplet lower than 12. Let me try 10,11,12: 10*11=110, 110*12=1320. That's way less than 2184. 11*12*13= 1716. Still less. 13*14*15=2730, which is more than 2184. So 12,13,14 is the correct triplet.\n\n\nThe problem asks for the sum of three consecutive integers whose product equals the sum of 727, 728, and 729. First, calculate the sum of these three numbers:  \n\\[\n727 + 728 + 729 = 2184.\n\\]  \nThus, the product of the three consecutive integers is 2184. Let the integers be \\(a\\), \\(a+1\\), and \\(a+2\\). Their product is:  \n\\[\na(a+1)(a+2) = 2184.\n\\]  \nTo find \\(a\\), approximate the cube root of 2184, which is approximately 12.9. Testing \\(a = 12\\):  \n\\[\n12 \\times 13 \\times 14 = 2184.\n\\]  \nThis confirms the three consecutive integers are 12, 13, and 14. Their sum is:  \n\\[\n12 + 13 + 14 = 39.\n\\]  \nSince the sum is 39, the correct answer is **E**.\n\nAnswer: E",

We need to find the sum of those three consecutive integers. Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should calculate what 727 + 728 + 729 equals. Let me add them up. 727 plus 728 is 1455, and then adding 729 gives me 1455 + 729. Wait, let me compute that again. 727 + 728 is 1455, right? Then 1455 + 729: 1455 + 700 is 2155, and then +29 makes it 2184. So the product of the three consecutive integers is 2184.\n\nNow, I need to find three consecutive integers whose product is 2184. Let me denote the three consecutive integers as n-1, n, and n+1. Their product would be (n-1)*n*(n+1) = n(n\u00b2-1). So, n(n\u00b2-1) = 2184.\n\nI need to find an integer n that satisfies this equation. Let's think about possible values of n. Let me estimate. The cube root of 2184 would give me a rough idea of what n might be. Let's calculate the cube root of 2184. I know that 12\u00b3 is 1728, and 13\u00b3 is 2197. Oh, wait, 13 cubed is 2197, which is very close to 2184. So, n is probably 13 or maybe 12? Let me check.\n\nIf n is 12, then the product would be 12*(144-1) = 12*143=1716, which is way less than 2184. So that's not it. If n is 13, then 13*(169-1)=13*168=2184. Oh, that's exactly the product we're looking for! So the three consecutive integers are 12, 13, and 14. Because n-1 is 12, n is 13, and n+1 is 14.\n\nNow, the question asks for the sum of these three integers. Let's add them up: 12 + 13 + 14. That equals 12+13=25, and 25+14=39. So the sum is 39. Looking at the options, E is 39. So the correct answer should be E.\n\nWait a second, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me double-check the product. 12 * 13 is 156, and 156 *14. Let's compute that. 156 *10 is 1560, 156*4 is 624, so 1560 + 624 is 2184. Yep, that's correct. So the sum is indeed 39. So the answer is E.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. So, the question says that the product of three consecutive integers is equal to the sum of 727, 728, and 729. We need to find the sum of those three consecutive integers. Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should calculate what 727 + 728 + 729 equals. Let me add them up. 727 plus 728 is 1455, and then adding 729 gives me 1455 + 729. Wait, let me compute that again. 727 + 728 is 1455, right? Then 1455 + 729: 1455 + 700 is 2155, and then +29 makes it 2184. So the product of the three consecutive integers is 2184.\n\nNow, I need to find three consecutive integers whose product is 2184. Let me denote the three consecutive integers as n-1, n, and n+1. Their product would be (n-1)*n*(n+1) = n(n\u00b2-1). So, n(n\u00b2-1) = 2184.\n\nI need to find an integer n that satisfies this equation. Let's think about possible values of n. Let me estimate. The cube root of 2184 would give me a rough idea of what n might be. Let's calculate the cube root of 2184. I know that 12\u00b3 is 1728, and 13\u00b3 is 2197. Oh, wait, 13 cubed is 2197, which is very close to 2184. So, n is probably 13 or maybe 12? Let me check.\n\nIf n is 12, then the product would be 12*(144-1) = 12*143=1716, which is way less than 2184. So that's not it. If n is 13, then 13*(169-1)=13*168=2184. Oh, that's exactly the product we're looking for! So the three consecutive integers are 12, 13, and 14. Because n-1 is 12, n is 13, and n+1 is 14.\n\nNow, the question asks for the sum of these three integers. Let's add them up: 12 + 13 + 14. That equals 12+13=25, and 25+14=39. So the sum is 39. Looking at the options, E is 39. So the correct answer should be E.\n\nWait a second, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me double-check the product. 12 * 13 is 156, and 156 *14. Let's compute that. 156 *10 is 1560, 156*4 is 624, so 1560 + 624 is 2184. Yep, that's correct. So the sum is indeed 39. So the answer is E.\n\n\nThe sum of 727, 728, and 729 is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n727 + 728 + 729 = 2184\n\\]\n\nWe need to find three consecutive integers whose product equals 2184. Let the integers be \\(n-1\\), \\(n\\), and \\(n+1\\). Their product is:\n\n\\[\n(n-1) \\cdot n \\cdot (n+1) = n(n^2 - 1)\n\\]\n\nSetting this equal to 2184:\n\n\\[\nn(n^2 - 1) = 2184\n\\]\n\nEstimating \\(n\\) by taking the cube root of 2184, we find that \\(n \\approx 13\\). Testing \\(n = 13\\):\n\n\\[\n13(13^2 - 1) = 13(169 - 1) = 13 \\cdot 168 = 2184\n\\]\n\nThus, the three consecutive integers are 12, 13, and 14. Their sum is:\n\n\\[\n12 + 13 + 14 = 39\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the sum of the three consecutive integers is **39**.\n\nAnswer: E",

Let's see:\n\n2184 \u00f7 2 = 1092\n1092 \u00f7 2 = 546\n546 \u00f7 2 = 273\n273 \u00f7 3 = 91\n91 \u00f7 7 = 13\nSo the prime factors are 2^3 * 3 * 7 * 13.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can find n such that n is around the cube root of 2184. Let's compute the cube root of 2184.\n\nWhat's 12 cubed? 12*12=144, 144*12=1728. 13 cubed is 2197. Oh, wait, 2197 is 13\u00b3. So 13\u00b3 is 2197, which is just a bit larger than 2184. So 13 cubed is 2197, which is 13 more than 2184. Hmm.\n\nWait, so n must be around 12 or 13. Let me try n=12. Let's compute 12*(12\u00b2 -1) = 12*(144-1)=12*143=1716. That's less than 2184. How about n=13? 13*(169-1)=13*168=2184. Oh, exactly. So n=13.\n\nWait, so the three consecutive integers are 12, 13, 14. Because if n is 13, then the numbers are 12, 13, 14. So their product is 12*13*14=2184, which matches.\n\nThen, the sum of these three integers is 12 +13 +14 = 39. So the answer should be E)39.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me compute 12*13*14.\n\n12*13 is 156, then 156*14. 156*10=1560, 156*4=624. 1560+624=2184. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the sum is 12+13+14 = 39. So the correct option is E)39.\n\nWait, but the options are A)37, B)38, C)36, D)30, E)39. So E is 39, which is the sum. So the answer is E.\n\n\nThe problem requires finding the sum of three consecutive integers whose product equals the sum of 727, 728, and 729. First, calculate the sum:\n\n\\[\n727 + 728 + 729 = 2184\n\\]\n\nThus, the product of the three consecutive integers is 2184. Let the integers be \\( n-1 \\), \\( n \\), and \\( n+1 \\). Their product is:\n\n\\[\n(n-1) \\cdot n \\cdot (n+1) = n(n^2 - 1) = 2184\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nn^3 - n - 2184 = 0\n\\]\n\nTo solve this cubic equation, approximate the cube root of 2184. Since \\( 12^3 = 1728 \\) and \\( 13^3 = 2197 \\), \\( n \\) is likely close to 13. Testing \\( n = 13 \\):\n\n\\[\n13 \\cdot (13^2 - 1) = 13 \\cdot 168 = 2184\n\\]\n\nThis confirms \\( n = 13 \\), so the three consecutive integers are 12, 13, and 14. Their sum is:\n\n\\[\n12 + 13 + 14 = 39\n\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: E**",
