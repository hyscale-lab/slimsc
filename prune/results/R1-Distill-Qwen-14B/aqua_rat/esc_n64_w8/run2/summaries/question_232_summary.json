      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to convert the weight of a bag of cat food from pounds and ounces to just ounces. Hmm, I remember that pounds and ounces are units of weight, with pounds being a larger unit than ounces. But wait, how exactly do I convert them?\n\nThe bag weighs 7 pounds and 4 ounces. Oh right, I think I need to convert the pounds into ounces first and then add the remaining ounces. I remember that 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces. So, for 7 pounds, that should be 7 multiplied by 16. Let me calculate that: 7 times 16. Well, 7 times 10 is 70, and 7 times 6 is 42, so adding those gives 70 +42=112 ounces from the pounds part.\n\nWait, but there's also the 4 ounces. So I need to add that 4 to the 112 ounces. Let me do that: 112 plus 4 equals 116. So the total weight in ounces is 116 ounces.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 116.

Hmm, I remember that pounds and ounces are units of weight, and I think I need to convert the pounds into ounces first. Let me think about how many ounces are in a pound. Oh right, one pound is equal to 16 ounces. Right, so each pound is 16 ounces.\n\nThe problem says the bag weighs 7 pounds and 4 ounces. So I need to convert the 7 pounds into ounces and then add the remaining 4 ounces. Let me calculate that. \n\nFirst, 7 pounds times 16 ounces per pound. So 7 * 16. Let's do that math. 7 times 10 is 70, and 7 times 6 is 42. So 70 +42 is 112 ounces from the pounds. Then I have an additional 4 ounces, so I add that to 112. 112 +4 is 116 ounces total.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the numbers. Oh yeah, 7 pounds is 112 ounces, and adding the 4 ounces gives 116. So looking at the options, option C is 116. So the correct answer should be C.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. Pounds to ounces conversion is straightforward. 7 *16 is 112, plus 4 makes 116. Yep, that's right.\n",
