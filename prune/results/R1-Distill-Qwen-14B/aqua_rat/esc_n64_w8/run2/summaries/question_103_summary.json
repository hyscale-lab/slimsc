      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me read it again and try to figure it out step by step. The question says, \"M men agree to purchase a gift for Rs. D. If 3 men drop out, how much more will each have to contribute towards the purchase of the gift?\" And there are five options to choose from.\n\nHmm, right. So initially, there are M men sharing the cost D. So each man's share must be D divided by M. That makes sense because if you split the total cost equally among all of them, each pays D/M.\n\nNow, the problem says 3 men drop out. So the number of men remaining is M minus 3. Wait, no, wait. If 3 drop out, it's M-3 men left. So the new cost per person would be the total cost D divided by (M-3). Because now each of the remaining men has to cover the same total cost, but with fewer people.\n\nSo the original contribution per person was D/M. After 3 drop out, it's D/(M-3). The question is asking how much more each has to contribute. So I need to find the difference between the new contribution and the original one.\n\nSo the increase per person is [D/(M-3)] minus [D/M]. Let me calculate that. \n\nLet me write that down:\n\nIncrease = D/(M-3) - D/M.\n\nTo subtract these two fractions, I'll find a common denominator, which would be M*(M-3). So:\n\nIncrease = [D*M - D*(M-3)] / [M*(M-3)].\n\nExpanding the numerator:\n\nD*M - D*M + 3D = 3D.\n\nSo the numerator is 3D, denominator is M*(M-3).\n\nSo the increase is 3D/(M*(M-3)).\n\nWait, but let me check the options. The options are:\n\nA) D/(M-3)\nB) MD/3\nC) M/(D-3)\nD) 3D/(M\u00b2 - 3M)\nE) None of these.\n\nHmm, looking at option D, the denominator is M squared minus 3M, which is the same as M*(M-3). So option D is 3D/(M\u00b2-3M), which is exactly what I got.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm interpreting the question correctly. The problem asks how much more each has to contribute. So yes, it's the difference between the new share and the old share, which is 3D/(M*(M-3)), which is option D.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Another approach: original contribution is D/M. After 3 drop out, each pays D/(M-3). The additional amount is this new amount minus the old. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me plug in some numbers to see if this makes sense. Let's say M is 10 and D is 100. So each man initially pays 100/10 = 10 Rs.\n\nIf 3 drop out, now there are 7 men. Each now pays 100/7 \u2248 14.2857 Rs.\n\nThe increase per person is 14.2857 -10 \u22484.2857 Rs.\n\nNow, let's compute option D: 3D/(M\u00b2-3M) = 3*100/(100-30) = 300/(70) \u22484.2857, which matches. So that works.\n\nLet me check option A: D/(M-3) is 100/(7) \u224814.2857, which is the new contribution, not the increase. So option A is the new amount, not the increase.\n\nOption B: MD/3 is 10*100/3 \u2248333.33, which doesn't make sense here because the increase is way smaller.\n\nOption C: M/(D-3) is 10/(97) \u22480.103, which is way off.\n\nSo the correct answer is option D.\n",

So initially, there are M men contributing to a total amount D. That means each man is paying D divided by M, right? So the initial contribution per man is D/M.\n\nNow, 3 men drop out. So the number of men remaining is M minus 3. So the new number of contributors is M-3. The total amount they need to pay is still D because the gift's cost doesn't change. So each remaining man now has to pay D divided by (M-3). That's D/(M-3) per person.\n\nThe question asks how much more each will have to contribute. So I need to find the difference between the new contribution and the old one. The new contribution is D/(M-3) and the old was D/M. So the difference is D/(M-3) minus D/M.\n\nLet me compute that. Let's factor out D: D [1/(M-3) - 1/M]. To subtract these fractions, I need a common denominator, which would be M(M-3).

The difference in contribution is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = \\frac{D}{M-3} - \\frac{D}{M}.\n\\]\n\nTo simplify, find a common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = \\frac{D \\cdot M - D \\cdot (M-3)}{M(M-3)} = \\frac{D \\cdot M - D \\cdot M + 3D}{M(M-3)} = \\frac{3D}{M(M-3)}.\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3D}{M^2 - 3M}.\n\\]\n\nComparing this result with the options, it matches option D.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again and think through it step by step. \n\nThe question says: M men agree to purchase a gift for Rs. D. If 3 men drop out, how much more will each have to contribute towards the purchase of the gift? And there are five options provided, labeled A to E.\n\nHmm. So initially, there are M men sharing the cost D. So each person is paying D divided by M, right? So the original contribution per person is D/M.\n\nNow, 3 men drop out. That means the number of men remaining is M minus 3. So the new number of contributors is M-3. The total cost D remains the same, so each of the remaining men will now have to pay D divided by (M-3). So the new contribution per person is D/(M-3).\n\nThe question asks how much more each will have to contribute. So I need to find the difference between the new contribution and the original contribution. That would be [D/(M-3)] minus [D/M]. \n\nLet me compute that difference. \n\nSo, D/(M-3) - D/M. Let's factor D out: D [1/(M-3) - 1/M]. To subtract these fractions, I'll find a common denominator, which is M(M-3). \n\nSo, 1/(M-3) is equal to M/(M(M-3)), and 1/M is (M-3)/(M(M-3)). Subtracting these gives [M - (M-3)] / [M(M-3)].\n\nWait, that numerator simplifies. M minus (M-3) is M - M +3, which is 3. So the entire fraction becomes 3/(M(M-3)). \n\nSo the difference is D multiplied by that, which is D * [3/(M(M-3))]. Which can be written as (3D)/(M(M-3)). Alternatively, factoring the denominator, that's 3D divided by (M\u00b2 -3M), since M*(M-3) is M\u00b2-3M.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3D/(M\u00b2-3M), which matches what I've got here.

Let me compute 1/(M-3) minus 1/M.\n\n1/(M-3) - 1/M = [M - (M-3)] / [M(M-3)].\n\nWait, that's [M - M +3] / [M(M-3)] = 3/(M(M-3)).\n\nSo the increase is D multiplied by 3/(M(M-3)), which is 3D/(M(M-3)).\n\nWhich is the same as 3D/(M\u00b2 -3M), because M(M-3) is M squared minus 3M.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption D: 3D/(M\u00b2 -3M) \u2192 yes, that's exactly what I got.\n\nSo the correct answer is D.\n\nWait, but let me check the other options to be sure.\n\nOption A: D/(M-3).

MD/3 would be (M*D)/3, which doesn't fit the calculation. So probably not B.\n\nOption C: M/(D-3). That doesn't make sense dimensionally. D is a cost, M is number of men. So M/(D-3) would be a rate, but we're looking for an increase in contribution, which is in Rs. So C is probably wrong.\n\nOption E is none of these.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about M men agreeing to buy a gift for Rs. D. The question is, if 3 men drop out, how much more will each have to contribute? Hmm, let me think.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. Initially, there are M men sharing the cost D. So, each man would pay D divided by M, right? Because total cost divided by number of people. So the initial contribution per man is D/M.\n\nNow, if 3 men drop out, the number of men becomes M minus 3. So the new number of people is M-3. The total cost D is still the same, so now each person has to pay D/(M-3). \n\nThe question is asking how much more each will have to contribute. So I need to find the difference between the new contribution and the original one. That would be D/(M-3) minus D/M. \n\nLet me compute that. Let's write it out:\n\nDifference = [D/(M-3)] - [D/M]\n\nI can factor out D:\n\n= D [1/(M-3) - 1/M]\n\nTo subtract these fractions, I'll find a common denominator, which is M(M-3). So:\n\n= D [ M - (M-3) ) / (M(M-3)) ]\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\nM - (M-3) is M - M +3 = 3.\n\nSo the difference becomes:\n\n= D * [3 / (M(M-3)) ]\n\nWhich simplifies to 3D/(M(M-3)). Wait, looking at the options, I don't see that exact expression. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are:\nA) D/(M-3)\nB) MD/3\nC) M/(D-3)\nD) 3D/(M\u00b2-3M)\nE) None of these\n\nWait, option D is written as 3D/(M\u00b2-3M). Oh, because M\u00b2-3M is M(M-3). So option D is the same as my result.\n\nSo the correct answer should be D. But wait, wait. Let me double-check. The question is how much more each has to contribute. So the calculation is correct. The increase per person is 3D/(M(M-3)), which is the same as option D.\n\nAlternatively, let me think if I could have made a mistake. For example, maybe I should have calculated the total cost per person after and subtracted the original, which is what I did. So I think it's right. So the answer should be option D.\n\n\nInitially, there are \\( M \\) men sharing the cost \\( D \\), so each man pays \\( \\frac{D}{M} \\).

Then, 3 men leave, so now there are M-3 men left. I need to find out how much more each remaining man has to pay compared to before.\n\nLet me break this down. First, I'll calculate the original contribution per man. That's straightforward: each man pays D divided by M, right? So original per man cost is D/M.\n\nNow, when 3 men drop out, the number of men becomes M-3. So the new contribution per man would be the total cost D divided by (M-3). That makes sense because the same gift cost is being shared by fewer people.\n\nThe question asks how much more each has to contribute.

The increase in contribution per person is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{D}{M - 3} - \\frac{D}{M} = D \\left( \\frac{1}{M - 3} - \\frac{1}{M} \\right)\n\\]\n\nTo subtract the fractions, find a common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{M - 3} = \\frac{M}{M(M - 3)}, \\quad \\frac{1}{M} = \\frac{M - 3}{M(M - 3)}\n\\]\n\nSubtracting these gives:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{M - 3} - \\frac{1}{M} = \\frac{M - (M - 3)}{M(M - 3)} = \\frac{3}{M(M - 3)}\n\\]\n\nThus, the increase in contribution per person is:\n\n\\[\nD \\cdot \\frac{3}{M(M - 3)} = \\frac{3D}{M(M - 3)}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying \\( M(M - 3) \\) as \\( M^2 - 3M \\), the increase becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3D}{M^2 - 3M}\n\\]\n\nThis matches option D, which is \\( \\frac{3D}{M^2 - 3M} \\). Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: D**",
