      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here: 900 plus 5 times 12. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my math, but I think I can figure this out. Wait, I remember something about order of operations. Oh right, PEMDAS\u2014Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction. So I shouldn't just go from left to right, right? Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the problem is 900 + 5 \u00d7 12. According to PEMDAS, multiplication comes before addition. So I should calculate 5 multiplied by 12 first. Let me do that. 5 times 12 is 60. Oh wait, yeah, because 5 times 10 is 50, and 5 times 2 is 10, so 50 plus 10 is 60. Got it.\n\nNow that I have that result, I add it to 900. So 900 plus 60. Hmm, adding those together. 900 plus 60 is 960. Let me double-check that. 900 plus 60 would be like 900 plus 0 is 900, plus 60 is 960. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me look at the options again. The options are A)820, B)202, C)420, D)209, E)960. So E is 960, which matches what I calculated. That should be the correct answer.\n\nI think I might have made a mistake if I did the addition first, but that's not how it works. If I added 900 and 5 first, I'd get 905, then multiply by 12, which would be a much larger number, but that's not one of the options. So yeah, I did it right. Multiplication first, then addition.

Hmm, let me think about how to solve this.\n\nWait, I remember from school that when solving equations, I should follow the order of operations, right? Oh yeah, PEMDAS or BODMAS or something like that. So that's Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and then Addition and Subtraction. So in this problem, I don't see any parentheses or exponents, so the first thing I should do is handle the multiplication part.\n\nSo the equation is 900 + 5 \u00d7 12. I need to calculate 5 multiplied by 12 first. Let me do that: 5 times 12 is... 5 times 10 is 50, and 5 times 2 is 10, so 50 plus 10 is 60. So 5\u00d712 equals 60.\n\nNow the equation simplifies to 900 + 60. Adding those together. 900 plus 60 is 960. So the result should be 960.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 960. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I do that correctly? Sometimes I get confused with the order. Let me double-check. Oh yeah, because multiplication comes before addition. So I definitely did it right. 5\u00d712 is 60, then 900+60 is 960. Yeah, that's correct. So E is the right choice.\n",
