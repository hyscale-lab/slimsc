      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to solve this problem. So, the question is about figuring out how old Rahim is now, based on the information given about Raj's age.\n\nLet me read the problem again. Raj was one-third as old as Rahim five years back. Now, Raj is 17 years old. So, I need to find out Rahim's current age.\n\nHmm, I think I should start by writing down what I know. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's note Raj's current age. The problem says Raj is 17 now. So, Raj's age now is 17.\n\nThe other piece of information is about their ages five years ago. Five years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim was at that time. So, I need to express their ages five years ago in terms of variables.\n\nLet me assign variables to make this easier. Let me let R represent Rahim's current age. Then, five years ago, Raj's age would have been 17 minus 5, which is 12. Because if he's 17 now, subtracting 5 years gives 12.\n\nFive years ago, Raj's age was 12. At that same time, Rahim's age would have been R minus 5, right? Because if someone is R years old now, five years ago they were R-5.\n\nThe problem states that five years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim. So, Raj's age then (12) equals one-third of Rahim's age then (R -5). So, mathematically, that would be:\n\n12 = (1/3) * (R - 5)\n\nHmm, I can solve this equation for R. Let me write it out:\n\n12 = (R -5)/3\n\nTo get rid of the fraction, I can multiply both sides by 3. That would give:\n\n12 * 3 = R -5\n36 = R -5\n\nThen, add 5 to both sides to solve for R:\n\n36 +5 = R\n41 = R\n\nSo, R is 41. That means Rahim is 41 years old now.\n\nLet me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Raj is 17 now, so five years ago he was 12. At that time, he was 1/3 as old as Rahim. So, 12 is 1/3 of (Rahim's age five years ago). So, 12 *3 = 36 is Rahim's age five years ago. So, adding 5 years to that gives 41. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nSo, looking at the options, B is 41.

First, I'll note down what I know. Raj's current age is 17. Five years ago, that would make Raj 17 minus 5, which is 12 years old. So Raj was 12 five years ago.\n\nThe problem states that five years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim was then. So, if I let Rahim's age five years ago be some variable, maybe R, then I can set up an equation.\n\nWait, let me think. If Raj was one-third of Rahim's age five years ago, then Raj's age then equals (1/3) * Rahim's age then. So, Raj's age five years ago is 12. So, 12 equals (1/3) * R, where R is Rahim's age five years ago.\n\nTo find R, I can rearrange this equation. Multiply both sides by 3. That gives me 12 * 3 = R. So 36 equals R.

So, if I let Rahim's age five years ago be R, then Raj's age (12) would be equal to (1/3) * R. \n\nWait, so 12 equals (1/3) R. To find R, I can rearrange that.

And now, Raj is 17 years old. So, I think I can use these two pieces of information to find Rahim's current age.\n\nHmm, let's break it down. First, let's figure out how old Raj was 5 years ago. Since he's 17 now, subtracting 5 would make him 12 years old at that time. So, Raj's age five years ago was 12.\n\nNow, the problem says that at that time, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim. So, if I let Rahim's age five years ago be R, then Raj's age (12) would be equal to (1/3) * R. \n\nWait, so 12 equals (1/3) R. To find R, I can rearrange that. Multiply both sides by 3, which gives R = 12 * 3 = 36. So, five years ago, Rahim was 36 years old.\n\nBut wait, that's his age five years ago.

Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nThe problem says that Raj was one-third as old as Rahim five years ago. And now Raj is 17 years old. I need to find out Rahim's current age.\n\nFirst, let's think about what we know. Raj's current age is 17. So, five years ago, Raj was 17 minus 5, which is 12 years old. Because 17 minus 5 is 12. So five years ago, Raj was 12.\n\nNow, at that same time, five years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim was. So, if I let Rahim's age five years ago be some number, say R, then Raj's age then would be R divided by 3. Because Raj was one-third as old.\n\nWait, let me write that as an equation. Let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s say, five years ago, Rahim's age was R. Then Raj's age was R/3.\n\nBut we already know Raj's age five years ago was 12. So, R/3 = 12.\n\nTo find R, I can solve this equation. Multiply both sides by 3. So R = 12 * 3 = 36. So five years ago, Rahim was 36 years old.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because if R is 36, then now, five years later, Rahim would be 36 +5 =41. But wait, that's one of the options, option B.\n\nWait, let me double-check. So if five years ago, Raj was 12, and that was one-third of Rahim's age then, then R=36. So now, five years later, Rahim is 36 +5=41. So the answer is B)41.\n\nBut wait, let me think again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the setup is correct. Raj's age five years ago is 12, which is one-third of Rahim's age then. So 12 = (Rahim's age five years ago) /3. So solving for R, it's 36. Then, adding five years, 36+5=41. So yes, that makes sense.\n\nAnother way to think about it: Let me assign variables. Let R be Raj's current age, which is 17. Let\u2019s say, five years ago, Raj was (R -5) = 12. At that time, Rahim's age was (let me call it X) so X = 3*(Raj's age then) = 3*12=36. So, five years ago, Rahim was 36, so now he's 36+5=41.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer should be 41, which is option B.\n",
