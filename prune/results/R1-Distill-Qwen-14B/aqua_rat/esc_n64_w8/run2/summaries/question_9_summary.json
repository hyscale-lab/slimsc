      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe problem says: There are 200 students in a school. At least 45% attended the prom night, and at least 35% took part in the debating session. What's the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom nor the debate?\n\nHmm, so I need to find the maximum possible number of students who didn't go to prom and didn't participate in the debate. That means I'm looking for the highest number of students who are outside both events.\n\nFirst, let's break down the percentages. 45% of 200 is 90 students. So at least 90 went to prom. Similarly, 35% of 200 is 70 students, so at least 70 were in the debate.\n\nWait, but percentages can sometimes be tricky. The question says \"at least\" these percentages. So the number attending prom could be more than 90, and the same for the debate, but not less.\n\nI remember something about set theory and maybe using a Venn diagram. Oh right, this is a problem about overlapping sets. To find the maximum number outside both, I think I need to minimize the number of students who attended either event or both. Because if more students are in either event, fewer are left out.\n\nWait, but how do I find the minimum number in the union of the two events? Oh, right, the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The formula is |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|. But since we want the maximum number of students who are neither, we want to minimize |A \u222a B|.\n\nSo to minimize |A \u222a B|, we need to maximize |A \u2229 B|, the number of students who did both. Because that way, the overlap is as big as possible, so the total number in either event is as small as possible.\n\nWait, but how much can the overlap be? The maximum possible overlap is the smaller of the two sets. Because you can't have more people overlapping than the size of the smaller set.\n\nSo the minimum number of students in either event is when the overlap is maximum. So the maximum possible overlap is the smaller of 90 and 70, which is 70. So |A \u2229 B| can be up to 70.\n\nSo substituting into the inclusion-exclusion formula:\n\n|A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|\n= 90 + 70 - 70\n= 90.\n\nWait, so the minimum possible number of students in either event is 90? Because that's when the overlap is maximum.\n\nBut wait, that's not possible. If both events have at least 90 and 70, the minimum union is 90 +70 -70 = 90. Hmm, but wait, if 70 are in both, then 90 in prom would include the 70, so 90 in prom. The debate has 70, all of whom are in prom. So the union is 90. So that's correct.\n\nSo the minimum number in the union is 90. Therefore, the number of students who attended either event is at least 90. So the maximum number who didn't attend either is 200 - 90 = 110.\n\nWait, but the options are A)27, B)81, C)90, D)99, E)110.\n\nSo that would make E)110 the answer. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, if 90 students went to prom and all 70 debate students were among them, then the union is 90. So 200 -90 is 110. So 110 students neither attended prom nor debated.\n\nBut wait, is that the maximum possible? Because if the overlap is less, the union would be larger, leaving fewer students out. So to maximize the number of students who didn't attend either, we want the union to be as small as possible, which is when the overlap is maximum.\n\nSo yes, the maximum number who didn't attend either is 110, which is option E.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because 110 is a big number, more than half. Let me think again.\n\nWait, 45% is 90 students. 35% is 70. So if all 70 debate students are within the 90 prom-goers, then the union is 90. So 200-90=110. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the overlap is less, say, 0, then the union would be 90+70=160. Then 200-160=40, which is a much smaller number. So the maximum number of students not in either is when the union is smallest, which is when the overlap is maximum.\n\nSo yes, 110 is correct. So the answer should be E)110.\n",

So to maximize the number of students who didn't go to prom or debate, we need to minimize the number who did attend either. Because the more who went to either, the fewer who didn't.\n\nBut wait, I think I should consider the overlaps. Because some students might have gone to both events. If more students went to both, then the total number attending either would be lower, which would leave more who didn't go to either. But wait, no, actually, if the overlap is higher, the total number in at least one event is less. Let me think.\n\nWait, no. The formula for the union of two sets is |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|. So to minimize the number of students who attended either prom or debate (so that more didn't attend either), we need to maximize the overlap between the two groups. Because that would subtract as much as possible.\n\nSo, the maximum possible overlap is the minimum of the two groups. So if 90 went to prom and 70 to debate, the maximum overlap is 70. Because all the debate participants could also have been prom attendees.\n\nSo if all 70 debate students were also at prom, then the total number attending at least one event would be 90 (prom) + (70 -70) [since 70 are overlapping] = 90. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, let me calculate it again.\n\nWait, if all 70 debate attendees were also in prom, then the total number in either is just 90.

So if 90 attended prom and 70 debate, but all 70 were part of the 90, then the union is 90. So 200-90=110 didn't attend either.\n\nBut wait, is that possible? Let's think. At least 90 attended prom. At least 70 attended debate. But if all 70 were part of the 90, then yes, the union is 90. So that would leave 110 who didn't go to either.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The problem says \"at least\" 45% and \"at least\" 35%. So the minimums are 90 and 70. So to maximize the number of students who didn't attend either, we should assume that as many as possible of the debate attendees were already in the prom group. So the maximum possible overlap is 70, because there are only 70 debate attendees. So the union is 90.\n\nWait, but another way: the minimum number who attended at least one event is the sum of the two minimums minus the maximum possible overlap. So 90 +70 -70 =90.

The options are A)27, B)81, C)90, D)99, E)110. So E is an option.\n\nBut wait, another approach: what if the number of students attending either is as small as possible? Because that would leave the maximum number who didn't attend either.\n\nThe minimum number of students attending at least one event is the sum of the two minimums minus the maximum possible overlap. So |A \u222a B| \u2265 |A| + |B| - N, where N is the total.\n\nWait, more accurately, the maximum possible overlap is the minimum of |A| and |B|. So in this case, |A|=90, |B|=70. The maximum possible overlap is 70. So the minimum possible |A \u222a B| is 90 +70 -70 =90.\n\nSo the minimum number attending either is 90.

So x can be up to 70, because there are only 70 debate attendees. So 90 +70 -70 =90. So the minimal number attending at least one is 90.

Because if I find the minimum attendees, that leaves the maximum number of students who didn't attend either.\n\nSo, for the prom night: 45% of 200 is... let's see, 0.45 * 200 = 90 students. So at least 90 attended the prom.\n\nFor the debating session: 35% of 200 is 0.35 * 200 = 70 students. So at least 70 took part in the debate.\n\nNow, I'm trying to maximize the number of students who did neither. To do that, I should minimize the number who attended either or both events. Wait, but how?\n\nI remember something about the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The total number of students who attended at least one event is equal to the number who attended prom plus the number who debated minus those who did both. Because if I just add them, I'm double-counting the ones who were at both events.\n\nBut wait, since we're trying to find the maximum number of students who did neither, we need the minimum number of students who attended at least one of the events. So to minimize the number of attendees, I should maximize the overlap between the two groups. That is, as many students as possible attended both events, so that the total number of unique attendees is as small as possible.\n\nSo, the maximum possible overlap is the smaller of the two groups. Because you can't have more overlapping students than the size of the smaller group. Since the prom had 90 and debate had 70, the maximum overlap would be 70 students. Because all 70 debaters could have also gone to prom.\n\nSo, the minimum number of students who attended at least one event is 90 (prom) + 70 (debate) - 70 (overlap) = 90. Because 90 +70 is 160, minus 70 is 90. Wait, that can't be right because 90 is the size of prom. If all debate attendees were also at prom, then the total unique attendees are just 90.\n\nWait, so if 70 students are in both, then the number who went to prom only is 90 -70 = 20, and debate only is 0, because all 70 were already in prom. So total unique is 90.\n\nSo the total number who attended at least one event is 90. Therefore, the number who didn't attend either would be 200 - 90 = 110.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The options don't have 110 as the maximum. Let me look at the options again. Oh, option E is 110. But wait, the question asks for the maximum number who could have neither attended prom nor debated. So 110 is the maximum possible. But wait, can that be correct?\n\nWait, wait. Because 45% is the minimum for prom. So 90 is the minimum for prom, and 70 is the minimum for debate. So the maximum number who didn't attend either would be 200 minus the minimum number who attended at least one event.\n\nBut wait, the minimum number who attended at least one event is not necessarily 90. Because the sum of the two minima (90 +70) is 160, which is more than 200, so there's definitely some overlap. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because 90 +70 = 160, which is less than 200, so it's possible that all 160 are unique. Wait, no, that's not right. Because 90 +70 =160, which is less than 200, so the maximum possible number who attended at least one is 160, but that's not relevant here. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the minimum number of students who attended at least one event is the sum of the two minima minus the maximum possible overlap. But wait, the formula is |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|. So to minimize |A \u222a B|, we need to maximize |A \u2229 B|, which is the overlap.\n\nThe maximum possible overlap is the minimum of |A| and |B|. Because you can't have more overlapping than the size of the smaller set.\n\nSo |A| is 90, |B| is 70. So maximum overlap is 70. So |A \u222a B| = 90 +70 -70 =90.\n\nSo the minimum number of students who attended at least one event is 90. Therefore, the maximum number who didn't attend either is 200 -90=110.\n\nSo the answer should be E)110.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option E is 110. So that's the maximum. But I need to make sure that this is possible.\n\nWait, if 70 students attended both events, then 90-70=20 attended only prom, and 70 attended both. So the total is 90. The other 200-90=110 didn't attend either. So yes, this is possible.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"at least 45%\" and \"at least 35%\", which means the numbers could be higher than 90 and 70. But since we're looking for the maximum number of students who neither attended, we need to consider the minimal numbers.\n\nBecause if more students attended prom or debate, then fewer could have neither. So to maximize the number who neither, we take the minimal attendees for each event and maximize the overlap.\n\nSo yes, 200 -90=110. So the correct answer is E.\n",

So, to maximize the neither group, I need the smallest possible overlap between prom and debating attendees.\n\nWait, right, because the more students that went to prom or debated, the fewer are left. So to maximize the neither, I need the least number attending either, which would mean the minimum number who attended prom plus the minimum who debated, but without overlapping as much as possible. Hmm, maybe it's better to model this with some equations.\n\nSo, the minimum number of students who attended the prom is 45% of 200. Let me calculate that: 45% of 200 is 0.45 * 200 = 90 students.

So, if 90 went to prom and 70 debated, the maximum number who could have gone to both is 70 (since that's the smaller number).

Let me think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, let's see. There are 200 students in total. The problem states that at least 45% attended the prom, and at least 35% took part in the debating session. I need to find the maximum number who did neither. Hmm.\n\nWait, so first, I should probably calculate the minimum numbers involved. Because if I'm looking for the maximum number who didn't attend either, I want as few as possible to have attended either event. But the problem gives me the minimum percentages, so I guess I need to find the minimum number that attended each event and then see how that affects the number who didn't attend either.\n\nLet me break it down. \n\n45% of 200 students is 0.45 * 200 = 90 students. So at least 90 went to the prom. Similarly, 35% is 0.35 * 200 = 70 students. So at least 70 were in the debating session.\n\nBut wait, these are the minimums. So the number of students who went to prom could be 90 or more, and the same for the debate, 70 or more. But to find the maximum number who did neither, I need the number who did either to be as small as possible. Because the smaller the overlap, the more students could be outside both.\n\nSo I think I should consider the minimum possible number of students who attended at least one event. That would be the sum of the minimums minus the maximum possible overlap. Wait, no. The formula for the union of two sets is |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|. So the maximum possible for neither would be total minus the union.\n\nSo to maximize the neither, I need to minimize the union. To minimize the union, I need to maximize the overlap, because |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|. So if |A \u2229 B| is as large as possible, then |A \u222a B| is as small as possible.\n\nBut wait, wait. Wait, no. Because |A| and |B| are the minimums. So the smallest possible union would be when the overlap is as large as possible. So the maximum overlap is when as many students as possible attended both events. That would minimize the union, which in turn allows more students to be in neither.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.\n\nWe have to find the maximum number of students who neither attended prom nor debate. So, the complement of the union. So the maximum possible for neither is when the union is as small as possible.\n\nTo make the union as small as possible, we need to have as much overlap as possible between the two groups. So the minimum union is when the two groups have the maximum possible overlap.\n\nSo, the maximum possible overlap is when the number of students attending both is as high as possible. But the maximum possible is the smaller of the two minimums. Because you can't have more people in both events than the smaller of the two groups.\n\nWait, the minimum number in prom is 90, and in debate it's 70. So the maximum possible overlap is 70, because that's the smaller group. Because if all 70 debate attendees also went to prom, then the total union would be 90 + 70 -70 = 90. So the union is 90. So the number of students who attended at least one event is 90. Therefore, the number who did neither is 200 - 90 = 110.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because 110 is one of the options, option E. But I think I might have made a mistake here because I'm not considering that the prom could have more attendees.\n\nWait, another way to look at it: the minimum number in prom is 90, and the minimum in debate is 70. So the minimum number in either is at least 90 +70 -200 = -40, but since you can't have negative, the minimum union is max(0, 90 +70 -200) = 0. Wait, that can't be right. Because if 90 are in prom and 70 in debate, but some overlap, the union can't be more than 200.\n\nWait, the formula for the minimum union is |A| + |B| - N, where N is the total. So 90 +70 =160. 160 is less than 200, so the union can be as low as 160, but wait no, that's the maximum possible union. No, wait, wait. The maximum possible union is 200, but the minimum possible union is when the overlap is maximum. So the minimum union is when the two sets have as much overlap as possible.\n\nSo to find the minimum possible union, the maximum overlap is the minimum of |A| and |B|. So the maximum possible overlap is 70 (since 70 is less than 90). So the minimum union is 90 +70 -70=90. So the union is 90, and 200-90=110. So the maximum number who did neither is 110, which is option E.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 110. But the options given are A)27, B)81, C)90, D)99, E)110.\n\nSo that would suggest that the maximum is 110, but wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Because if 90 are in prom, 70 in debate, and all 70 in debate are also in prom, then the union is 90, so 200-90=110. But wait, is that possible? Because if 90 went to prom, and 70 of them also went to debate, then the number in debate is 70. So that's allowed, right? Because the problem states that at least 35% (70) took part in debate, so having exactly 70 is acceptable.\n\nSo the maximum number of students who could have neither is 110, which is option E. But wait, I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about it, I thought the maximum number would be 200 - (90 +70) = 40, but that's if there's no overlap, which is the maximum union, not the minimum.\n\nWait, no. Because the union can't be more than 200, but the minimum possible union is 90, so the maximum neither is 110.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. The problem says \"at least 45%\" and \"at least 35%\". So the numbers I used (90 and 70) are the minimums. So when I calculate the maximum number who did neither, I should take the minimums and find the maximum possible overlap, which leads to the minimum union, which gives the maximum neither.\n\nSo yes, 200 - (90 +70 -70) = 110.

The problem states that at least 45% attended the prom, and at least 35% took part in the debating session. I need to find the maximum number who did neither. Hmm.\n\nWait, so first, I should probably calculate the minimum numbers involved. Because if I'm looking for the maximum number who didn't attend either, I want as few as possible to have attended either event.

The total number of students is 200.\n\nThe formula for the union of two sets is |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|. But since I want the maximum number not in either, I need to minimize the number in the union.\n\nWait, wait. No, because the number of students not in either is 200 - |A \u222a B|. So to maximize this, I need to minimize |A \u222a B|.\n\nThe minimum value of |A \u222a B| occurs when the intersection |A \u2229 B| is as large as possible. Because |A| + |B| is fixed, subtracting a larger intersection reduces the union.\n\nSo what's the maximum possible |A \u2229 B|? It can't be more than the smaller of |A| and |B|. Here, |A|=90, |B|=70, so the maximum intersection is 70. Because all 70 debate participants could have also gone to prom. But wait, can that be the case?\n\nWait, if all 70 in B are also in A, then |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B| = 90 +70 -70 =90. So the union is 90.\n\nWait, but if all 70 of B are in A, then the union is 90, which is the size of A. That makes sense.\n\nSo in this case, |A \u222a B| is 90. So the number of students who attended at least one event is 90. Then, the number who didn't attend either is 200 -90=110.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. But the options have E as 110. But wait, is that possible? Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"at least\" 45% attended prom. So 45% is the minimum. So the number of prom attendees is >=90. Similarly, the number of debate participants is >=70.\n\nSo if I have exactly 90 prom attendees and exactly 70 debate attendees, with all 70 in the debate also in the prom, then the union is 90. So 200-90=110.\n\nBut wait, can the intersection be more than 70? Because |A| is 90. If B is 70, then the maximum possible intersection is 70. Because you can't have more in the intersection than the size of B.\n\nSo the maximum possible overlap is 70. So |A \u222a B|=90+70-70=90. So the minimum possible union is 90, leading to 200-90=110 as the maximum number who neither attended prom nor debated.\n\nBut looking at the options, E is 110. So is that the correct answer?\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again. The problem says \"at least\" 45% and \"at least\" 35%. So if more than 90 attended prom, say 100, and more than 70 debated, say 75, then the union could be larger, which would leave fewer students who didn't attend either. But we want the maximum number of students who didn't attend either, so we need the smallest possible union.\n\nSo the smallest possible union is when the overlap is maximum. So the minimum union is 90, as before. Hence, 110 students didn't attend either.\n\nWait, but wait again. Because 90 is the minimum number of prom attendees, right? So the maximum number who went to prom is 200, but the minimum is 90. So to minimize the union, we take the minimum number of prom attendees and the minimum number of debate attendees, with maximum overlap.\n\nSo in that case, the union is 90 (prom) +70 (debate) -70 (overlap) =90. So 200-90=110.\n\nSo the answer should be 110, which is option E.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another approach: the maximum number of students who didn't attend either is when as many as possible are in neither. So the number is total minus those who attended prom, minus those who debated, plus those who attended both (because they've been subtracted twice). Hmm, that's the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nBut wait, to maximize the number who didn't attend either, we need to maximize the number in both events. Because that way, the total in at least one is as small as possible.\n\nSo, the maximum possible in both is the minimum of the two individual numbers. So for prom, at least 90, for debate, at least 70. So the maximum possible overlap is 70. So the union is 90 +70 -70 =90. So 200-90=110.\n\nSo yeah, E is the correct answer. So the maximum number is 110.\n",

I remember that in set problems like this, the maximum number of people not in either set is found when the two sets (prom and debate) overlap as much as possible.

I need to find the maximum number of students who were neither at the prom nor in the debates.\n\nHmm, so first, I should calculate the minimum number of students who attended each event. Because if I know the minimum attendees, that leaves more room for students who didn't attend either, right?\n\nSo, 45% of 200 is 0.45 * 200 = 90 students. So at least 90 went to the prom. Similarly, 35% of 200 is 0.35 * 200 = 70 students. So at least 70 were in the debate.\n\nWait, but I'm trying to find the maximum number of students who did neither. So I want as many students as possible to be in neither event, which means I should minimize the number of students who attended at least one of the events.\n\nBut how do I do that? Oh right, this is a problem about overlapping sets. The idea is to find the maximum possible number of students who didn't go to either event. So, the maximum neither would be total students minus the minimum number who attended at least one event.\n\nWait, but how do I find the minimum number who attended at least one event? Because some students might have attended both. So, the minimum number attending either event is the sum of the minimum attendees of each event minus the maximum possible overlap. Because if everyone who went to the prom also went to the debate, that would minimize the total number of students who went to at least one event.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. To find the minimum number of students who went to at least one event, I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The formula is:\n\nNumber who attended prom or debate = Number who attended prom + Number who attended debate - Number who attended both.\n\nBut I want the minimum of the left side, which would mean I need to maximize the number who attended both. Because when you subtract a larger number, the total becomes smaller.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the number attending prom or debate is equal to A + B - C, where C is the overlap. So to minimize the total (A + B - C), you want C to be as large as possible.\n\nSo the maximum possible overlap is the smaller of the two numbers, because you can't have more overlap than the smaller group. So the maximum number of students who could have attended both is the smaller of 90 and 70, which is 70.\n\nWait, but wait, wait. Let me make sure. If 90 students went to prom and 70 to debate, the maximum overlap is 70. Because all 70 debate attendees could have also gone to prom. So in that case, the number who attended prom or debate is 90 + 70 - 70 = 90.\n\nWait, that's 90. So the minimum number of students who attended at least one event is 90. Because if all 70 debate attendees were also prom attendees, then the total is 90.\n\nSo the maximum number of students who didn't attend either would be total students minus 90. So 200 -90=110. Wait, but wait, 110 is one of the options (option E). But wait, the options given are A)27, B)81, C)90, D)99, E)110. So that would be E.\n\nBut wait a second. Let me check again. Because the problem says \"at least\" 45% and \"at least\" 35%. So the number attending prom is >=90, and debate is >=70.\n\nSo the minimum number of students attending either prom or debate is when the overlap is as large as possible.

So the minimum number attending either is 90 +70 -70=90.\n\nWait, but what if the number of prom attendees is more than 90? Let's say it's exactly 90, and the number of debate attendees is exactly 70. Then, if all 70 are in both, the total unique is 90. But if the prom attendees are more than 90, say 100, and the debate attendees are 70, then the maximum possible overlap is 70, so the total would be 100 +70 -70=100.
