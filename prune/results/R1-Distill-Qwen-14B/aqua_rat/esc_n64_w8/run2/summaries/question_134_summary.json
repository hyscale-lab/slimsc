      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about bus fares. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question says the bus fare for one adult is Rs. 140 from Ranchi to Patna. Then, the child's fare is half of the adult fare. The problem is asking for the total bus fare for 4 adults and 3 children. The options are given as A to E.\n\nHmm, right. So first, I need to find out the cost for each adult and each child, then multiply by the number of each and add them together. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe adult fare is straightforward: Rs. 140. So for four adults, that would be 4 multiplied by 140. Let me calculate that. 4 times 140 is... 560. Yeah, because 140 plus 140 is 280, times two (since 4 is two times two) gives 560. So that's the adult part.\n\nNow the child's fare is half of the adult's. So half of 140 is 70. So each child ticket is 70 rupees. There are 3 children, so that's 3 times 70. 3 multiplied by 70 is 210. That's the children's total.\n\nNow, to find the overall total fare, I need to add the adults' total and the children's total. So 560 plus 210. Let me add that. 560 plus 200 is 760, and then plus 10 more makes 770. Wait, but wait a second, that's 770. Let me double-check my math because that seems a bit high.\n\nWait, 4 adults at 140 each: 4 * 140 = 560. 3 children at 70 each: 3 * 70 = 210. Adding them together: 560 + 210 = 770. So the total is 770. Looking at the options, E is 770. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the question. Oh wait, the problem says the fare from Ranchi to Patna. So each person is going from Ranchi to Patna, so the fare is one way? I think so. So the calculation should be correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A) 666, B)670, C)700, D)570, E)770. So E is 770. So according to my calculation, that's the answer. But wait, why is option E the last one? Hmm.\n\nWait, did I add correctly? 560 plus 210. Let me compute it again. 560 + 200 is 760, then +10 is 770. Yep, that's right.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm supposed to calculate something else. Like, is the child's fare half for a single trip or for a round trip? The question says \"bus fare of a child is half the fare of one adult between the same places.\" So same places, same trip. So yes, the child's fare is 70. So the calculation seems correct.\n\nSo the total is 770, which is option E. So the answer should be E.\n",

Hmm, the question says the bus fare for one adult from Ranchi to Patna is Rs. 140. Oh wait, and the child's fare is half of that. So I need to find out the total fare for 4 adults and 3 children.\n\nAlright, let me break this down step by step. First, the adult fare is Rs. 140. So for each adult, that's straightforward. Now, the child's fare is half of that. So half of 140 would be 70, right? Because 140 divided by 2 is 70. So each child's ticket is Rs. 70.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the total for 4 adults. So 4 multiplied by 140. Let me do that math. 4 times 140 is 560. Because 140 times 4: 100*4 is 400, 40*4 is 160, so 400+160=560. Got that part.\n\nNext, the children's fare. There are 3 children, each paying Rs. 70. So 3 multiplied by 70. Let me compute that. 70 times 3 is 210. Yeah, that makes sense because 70+70 is 140, plus another 70 is 210.\n\nNow, to get the total fare, I add the adult fare total and the children's fare total together. So 560 plus 210. Let's add those. 560 + 200 is 760, and then plus 10 is 770. Wait, wait, that can't be right because the options don't have 770 as the first option. Oh wait, looking back, the options are A)666, B)670, C)700, D)570, E)770. Oh, E is 770. So that's the total?\n\nWait a second, wait. Did I do that correctly? Because 4 adults times 140 is 560. 3 children times 70 is 210. 560 plus 210 is indeed 770. So the total should be Rs. 770. So looking at the options, E is the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 140 per adult, 4 adults: 140 *4 = 560. Yes. Child fare is half: 70 each. 3 children: 70 *3 = 210. 560+210=770. Yep, that's correct. So the answer must be E) Rs. 770.\n",
