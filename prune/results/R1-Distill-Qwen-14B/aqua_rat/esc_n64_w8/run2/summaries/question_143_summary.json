      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about two cars starting from the same point and traveling in the same direction. They both started at the same time, but they have different speeds. The first car is going 55 mph, and the second one is at 52 mph. The question is asking how much time will pass before they're 15 miles apart. Hmm, I think I can figure this out.\n\nWait, since both are going in the same direction, the faster car will eventually overtake the slower one, right? But wait, no, wait\u2014actually, the question is about when they are 15 miles apart. So the faster car is behind and will start catching up, but the distance between them increases? No, wait, no. Because both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed between them is the difference in their speeds. So the first car is going faster than the second by 3 mph. So every hour, the first car gains 3 miles on the second one.\n\nWait, wait, but the initial position is that they start at the same point, so at time zero, their distance apart is zero. As time goes on, the first car gets ahead. So the distance between them increases. Oh wait, no! Wait, no\u2014no, wait a minute. No, actually, the first car is faster, so it's moving away from the second car. So the distance between them is increasing. So the question is, when will that distance be 15 miles.\n\nSo, let's think about it. The relative speed is 55 minus 52, which is 3 mph. So each hour, the distance between them increases by 3 miles. So if I want the distance to be 15 miles, how long does that take?\n\nI think I can use the formula: distance = speed \u00d7 time. The distance here is 15 miles, the relative speed is 3 mph. So time equals distance divided by speed. So time = 15 / 3 = 5 hours. So the answer should be 5 hours.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Let me double-check. The first car is moving at 55 mph, the second at 52. So in one hour, first car goes 55 miles, the second 52. The distance between them after one hour is 3 miles. After two hours, 6 miles.

The first car is going at 55 mph, and the second at 52 mph. I need to find out how long it takes before they're 15 miles apart. Hmm, wait, same direction, so the faster car is behind the slower one? No, wait, same starting point. So the first car is faster. Oh right, the first car is 55, the second 52. So the first car is moving faster than the second. So over time, the first car will start pulling ahead of the second.\n\nWait, but since they're going in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference between their speeds. Because the faster car is catching up, right? Wait no, wait. Wait, actually, when two objects are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference between their speeds. So the first car is moving away from the second at a relative speed of 55 -52 = 3 mph. So every hour, the distance between them increases by 3 miles.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The problem says how much time before the cars are 15 miles apart. Oh, right, because the first is faster, it's moving ahead. So the distance between them increases over time. So the initial distance is zero, and each hour, it adds 3 miles. So when does that sum reach 15 miles?\n\nSo I think the formula here is time = distance divided by relative speed. So distance is 15 miles, relative speed is 3 mph. So time is 15 / 3 = 5 hours. So the answer should be option B)5 hours.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let's model it. Let\u2019s say after t hours, the first car has gone 55t miles. The second has gone 52t. The distance between them is 55t -52t =3t miles. We want this to be 15 miles. So 3t =15 \u2192 t=5. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer is B)5 hours.\n\n\nTo determine how long it will take for the two cars to be 15 miles apart, we analyze their relative motion. Both cars start from the same point and travel in the same direction, but the first car moves at 55 mph, while the second moves at 52 mph. Since the first car is faster, the distance between them increases over time at a rate equal to the difference in their speeds: \n\n\\[\n\\text{Relative speed} = 55 \\, \\text{mph} - 52 \\, \\text{mph} = 3 \\, \\text{mph}.\n\\]\n\nThe distance between the cars increases by 3 miles every hour. To find the time \\( t \\) it takes for this distance to reach 15 miles, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\text{Relative speed} \\times \\text{Time}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\n15 = 3 \\times t \\implies t = \\frac{15}{3} = 5 \\, \\text{hours}.\n\\]\n\nThus, it will take 5 hours for the cars to be 15 miles apart. \n\nAnswer: B",

Both cars start at the same time, same place. The first car is going faster than the second. Oh wait, the first is doing 55 mph and the second is at 52 mph. So the first car is faster by 3 mph. \n\nThe question is asking how much time will pass before they are 15 miles apart. Wait, but since they're moving in the same direction, the distance between them increases over time because the first car is going faster. So I think I need to find the time when the distance between them is 15 miles.\n\nLet me think about their speeds. The relative speed between them is the difference because they're moving in the same direction. So relative speed is 55 minus 52, which is 3 mph. Right, because every hour, the first car gains 3 miles on the second.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the time when the distance covered at this relative speed equals 15 miles. Because that's when they are 15 miles apart.\n\nWait, distance equals speed multiplied by time. So the equation would be 3 mph * t hours = 15 miles. Solving for t, I can rearrange that. So t is 15 divided by 3, which is 5 hours.\n\nLet me double-check. In 5 hours, the first car would have gone 55 *5 = 275 miles. The second car would have gone 52 *5 = 260 miles. The difference is 15 miles. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 5 hours. So the answer should be B.\n",
