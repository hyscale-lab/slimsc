      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about the factory and the staplers. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe question says that 10% of the staplers produced on Monday were defective. Then, 2% of the non-defective ones were rejected by mistake. And they tell me that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected. I need to find the total number of staplers produced that day.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. Let me assign some variables to make it easier. Let's say the total number of staplers produced is N. \n\nFirst, 10% of N are defective. So the number of defective staplers is 0.10 * N. That means the non-defective ones are the rest, right? So non-defective = N - defective = N - 0.10N = 0.90N. \n\nWait, so non-defective is 90% of total. Got it.\n\nNow, of these non-defective staplers, 2% were rejected. So the number of rejected non-defectives is 2% of 0.90N. They told us this number is 72. So I can set up an equation.\n\nSo 2% of 0.90N equals 72. Let me write that mathematically: 0.02 * 0.90N = 72.\n\nLet me compute that. 0.02 times 0.90 is 0.018. So 0.018 N = 72.\n\nWait, so to find N, I can divide both sides by 0.018. So N = 72 / 0.018.\n\nLet me calculate that. 72 divided by 0.018. Hmm, 0.018 times what gives 72. Let me think in terms of moving decimals. 72 divided by 0.018 is the same as 72 multiplied by (1/0.018). 1/0.018 is approximately 55.555... because 0.018 * 55 = 0.99, and 0.018 * 55.555 is around 1. So 72 * 55.555.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to compute 72 divided by 0.018. Let me do the division step by step.\n\n0.018 goes into 72 how many times? Let me see:\n\n0.018 * 4000 = 72. Because 0.018 * 1000 is 18, so 4000 would be 4*18=72. So 4000 is the answer? Wait, but looking at the options, 4000 is option A. But wait, let me double-check my math.\n\nWait, 0.018 * 4000 is 0.018 *4,000. Let's calculate that: 4000 * 0.01 is 40, 4000 *0.008 is 32. So 40+32=72. Oh right, that's correct. So N is 4000, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 4,000, but I'm a bit confused because the options have higher numbers like 4,200 and so on. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me go through the steps again. Total N. 10% defective, so 90% non-defective: 0.9N. 2% of non-defective are rejected, so 0.02 * 0.9N = 72.\n\n0.02 * 0.9 is 0.018. 0.018 N =72. N=72/0.018=4000. So that's correct. So the total is 4000. But wait, the options have option A as 4,000. So that must be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I interpret the problem correctly? 2% of the non-defective were rejected. So yes, 0.02 * (0.9N) =72.\n\nWait, but maybe the 2% is 2% of all the non-defectives, not 2% of the total. So no, that's what I did. So 4000 is correct, which is option A. Hmm. So why is option D 4,800? Maybe I should check the calculation again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the percentage. Let me re-calculate 72 divided by 0.018.\n\nCalculating 72 / 0.018:\n\nLet me write this as 72 / (18/1000) ) = 72 * (1000/18) = (72 * 1000)/18.\n\n72 divided by 18 is 4, so 4 * 1000=4000. So yes, N=4000. So the answer should be A)4,000.\n\nWait, but in the options, A is 4,000 and D is 4,800. Hmm. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the percentages.\n\nWait, wait a second. The problem says 2% of the non-defective were rejected. So non-defective is 0.9N, and 2% of that is 0.02 *0.9N=0.018N=72. So N=72/0.018=4000. That seems right.\n\nBut perhaps the question is about the total number of rejected, not just non-defective? No, the question clearly states that 72 of the non-defective were rejected. So I think I'm correct.\n\nSo the answer should be A)4,000.\n",

So the answer should be option A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let the total number of staplers produced be \\( N \\). \n\n1. **Determine the number of non-defective staplers**:  \n   Since 10% of the staplers are defective, 90% are non-defective.  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Non-defective staplers} = 0.90N\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of non-defective staplers rejected**:  \n   2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected, and this is given as 72.  \n   \\[\n   0.02 \\times (0.90N) = 72\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( N \\)**:  \n   Simplify the equation:  \n   \\[\n   0.018N = 72\n   \\]  \n   Divide both sides by 0.018:  \n   \\[\n   N = \\frac{72}{0.018} = 4000\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of staplers produced that day is **4,000**.  \n\nAnswer: A",

It also tells me that 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected. I need to find out how many staplers were produced that day.\n\nHmm. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, let me denote the total number of staplers produced on Monday as N. That's what we're trying to find. So, N is the total.\n\n10% of these were defective. So, the number of defective staplers is 10% of N, which is 0.10 * N.\n\nThat means the non-defective staplers are the rest. So, non-defective = total - defective = N - 0.10N = 0.90N. So, 90% are non-defective.\n\nNow, the problem says 2% of the non-defective were rejected by mistake. So, 2% of 0.90N are the rejected non-defectives. And it's given that this number is 72.\n\nSo, mathematically, 0.02 * 0.90N = 72.\n\nLet me write that out: 0.02 * 0.90N = 72.\n\nWait, let me compute 0.02 * 0.90. 0.02 times 0.9 is 0.018. So, 0.018N = 72.\n\nTo find N, I can divide both sides by 0.018.\n\nSo, N = 72 / 0.018.\n\nLet me compute that. Hmm, 72 divided by 0.018. Alternatively, 7200 divided by 0.18.\n\nWait, 0.018 is 18/1000, so 72 divided by (18/1000) is 72 * (1000/18) = (72/18)*1000.\n\n72 divided by 18 is 4.

Oh, wait, so they took the non-defective ones, which are 0.90N, and 2% of those were mistakenly rejected. So the number of non-defective staplers that were rejected is 2% of 0.90N. Let me write that down: rejected = 0.02 * 0.90N. \n\nWait, the problem gives me that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected. So that means 0.02 * 0.90N equals 72.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a factory producing staplers. Hmm, let's see what it says. The question is a bit tricky, but I think I can figure it out step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem states: 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective. So, first off, I should note that. Let's say the total number of staplers produced is N. Then, 10% of N are defective. That means 0.10 * N defective staplers, and the rest, which is 90% of N, are non-defective. So non-defective = 0.90 * N.\n\nNext part: 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. Oh, okay, so they're talking about the non-defective ones being mistakenly rejected. So, the number of non-defective staplers that were rejected is 2% of the non-defective total. \n\nWait, the problem says that 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected. So, 2% of (non-defective) equals 72. Let me write that as an equation. So, 0.02 * (0.90 * N) = 72.\n\nHmm, let me compute that. So, 0.02 * 0.90 is 0.018. So, 0.018 * N =72. To find N, I can rearrange that: N = 72 / 0.018. Let me do that division.\n\nWait, 72 divided by 0.018. Hmm, 0.018 is the same as 18/1000, so 72 divided by 18/1000 is 72 * (1000/18). Let me compute that. 72 divided by 18 is 4. So 4 * 1000 is 4000. So N is 4000?\n\nWait, but looking at the options, 4000 is option A. But wait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nSo, 0.02 * 0.9N =72. 0.02*0.9 is 0.018. 0.018N=72. So N=72 /0.018. Let me compute 72 divided by 0.018. Another way to look at it: 72 /0.018 = (72 *1000)/18 = (72/18)*1000. 72 divided by 18 is 4, so 4 *1000 is 4000. So N=4000. So the total number produced is 4000. So the answer would be A)4,000.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option A is 4000. So that's one of the choices. But wait, let me think again. Did I interpret the problem correctly? The 2% is of the non-defective, right? Because if the non-defective are 90% of N, then 2% of that is the number rejected. And that number is given as 72.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So N is 4000. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, but another way to approach it: Let me check the steps again.\n\nTotal staplers: N.\n\nDefective: 10% of N = 0.1N.\n\nNon-defective: 90% of N = 0.9N.\n\nRejected non-defective: 2% of non-defective, which is 0.02 * 0.9N = 0.018N.\n\nGiven that 0.018N =72, so N=72 /0.018=4000. Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but wait another thing: Are the 72 non-defective rejected ones part of the 90% non-defective? Yes. So the calculation is correct. So the total is 4000.

The question is a bit tricky, but I think I can figure it out step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem states: 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective. So, first off, I should note that. Let's say the total number of staplers produced is N. Then, 10% of N are defective. That means 0.10 * N defective staplers, and the rest, which is 90% of N, are non-defective. So non-defective = 0.90 * N.\n\nNext part: 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. Oh, okay, so they're talking about the non-defective ones being mistakenly rejected. So, the number of non-defective staplers that were rejected is 2% of the non-defective total. \n\nWait, the problem says that 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected. So, 2% of (non-defective) equals 72. Let me write that as an equation. So, 0.02 * (0.90 * N) = 72.\n\nHmm, let me compute that. So, 0.02 * 0.90 is 0.018. So, 0.018 * N =72. To find N, I can rearrange that: N = 72 / 0.018. Let me do that division.\n\nWait, 72 divided by 0.018. Hmm, 0.018 is the same as 18/1000, so 72 divided by 18/1000 is 72 * (1000/18). Let me compute that. 72 divided by 18 is 4. So 4 * 1000 is 4000. So N is 4000?\n\nWait, but looking at the options, 4000 is option A. But wait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nSo, 0.02 * 0.9N =72. 0.02*0.9 is 0.018. 0.018N=72. So N=72 /0.018. Let me compute 72 divided by 0.018. Another way to look at it: 72 /0.018 = (72 *1000)/18 = (72/18)*1000. 72 divided by 18 is 4, so 4 *1000 is 4000. So N=4000. So the total number produced is 4000. So the answer would be A)4,000.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option A is 4000. So that's one of the choices. But wait, let me think again. Did I interpret the problem correctly? The 2% is of the non-defective, right? Because if the non-defective are 90% of N, then 2% of that is the number rejected. And that number is given as 72.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So N is 4000. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, but another way to approach it: Let me check the steps again.\n\nTotal staplers: N.\n\nDefective: 10% of N = 0.1N.\n\nNon-defective: 90% of N = 0.9N.\n\nRejected non-defective: 2% of non-defective, which is 0.02 * 0.9N = 0.018N.\n\nGiven that 0.018N =72, so N=72 /0.018=4000. Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but wait another thing: Are the 72 non-defective rejected ones part of the 90% non-defective? Yes. So the calculation is correct. So the total is 4000. So the answer is A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let the total number of staplers produced be \\( N \\). \n\n1. **Defective Staplers**: 10% of \\( N \\) are defective, so the number of non-defective staplers is \\( 0.90N \\).\n\n2. **Rejected Non-Defective Staplers**: 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. Therefore, the number of rejected non-defective staplers is \\( 0.02 \\times 0.90N = 0.018N \\).\n\n3. **Given Information**: The problem states that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected. Thus:\n   \\[\n   0.018N = 72\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( N \\)**:\n   \\[\n   N = \\frac{72}{0.018} = 4000\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of staplers produced that day is \\( N = 4000 \\).\n\nAnswer: A",

Let me read it again and see what it's asking.\n\nThe question says that 10% of the staplers produced on Monday were defective. So, out of all the staplers made, 10% are defective, which means 90% are non-defective. Got that part.\n\nThen it says that 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. Hmm, so some good staplers got rejected. And we're told that 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected. Wait, so that 2% equals 72? So we can probably use that to find out how many non-defective staplers there were.\n\nLet me think about this step by step. Let's denote the total number of staplers produced as T. So, 10% defective means 0.10*T defective, and 0.90*T non-defective.\n\nNow, 2% of those non-defective were rejected. So 2% of 0.90*T equals 72. Let me write that as an equation: 0.02 * (0.90*T) = 72.\n\nWait, is that right? Yeah, because 2% is 0.02, and it's of the non-defective ones, which are 90% of T. So 0.02 * 0.90*T = 72.\n\nLet me compute 0.02 * 0.90 first. 0.02 * 0.9 is 0.018. So 0.018 * T = 72.\n\nTo find T, I can divide both sides by 0.018. So T = 72 / 0.018.\n\nHmm, what's 72 divided by 0.018? Let me think. 0.018 is like 18/1000, so dividing by 18/1000 is the same as multiplying by 1000/18. So 72 * (1000/18) equals (72/18)*1000.\n\n72 divided by 18 is 4, right? Because 18 times 4 is 72. So 4*1000 is 4000. So T is 4000.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So 0.018 * 4000 equals 72. Let me compute 4000 * 0.018. 4000 * 0.01 is 40, and 4000 * 0.008 is 32. So 40 +32 is 72. Yep, that adds up.\n\nSo the total number of staplers produced that day is 4000. Looking back at the options, option A is 4,000. So the answer should be A.\n",
