      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a newspaper cost and a hotel ordering. Let me try to understand what's going on. Hmm, the newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days. The hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as on other days. And they pay $210 per week. I need to find out how many newspapers they buy on Monday.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Let me think about the variables involved. Let's say the number of newspapers the hotel buys on a non-Sunday day is x. Then, on Sunday, they buy twice that, so 2x. \n\nWait, but the days from Monday to Saturday are six days, right? Or wait, no, because the problem says \"the rest of the days of the week\". So the rest would be Monday through Saturday, which is six days. But wait, wait. Wait, the problem says \"the rest of the days of the week\", which is Monday to Saturday, so that's six days. So each of those days, they buy x newspapers. \n\nBut wait, no, no, wait. Wait, the way the problem is worded: \"the rest of the days of the week\"\u2014so that's Monday to Saturday, which is six days. So each day, the hotel buys x newspapers, but on Sunday, they buy twice that, so 2x. \n\nSo the total cost would be the cost for Sunday plus the cost for the other six days. \n\nThe cost on Sunday is 2x newspapers at $4 each. So that's 2x *4 = $8x. \n\nThe cost for each of the other six days is x newspapers at $1 each, so each day is $x. So for six days, that's 6 * x * $1 = 6x dollars.\n\nSo the total weekly cost is 8x + 6x = 14x. \n\nAnd the problem says the hotel pays $210 per week. So 14x = 210. \n\nLet me solve for x. 14x = 210, so x = 210 /14. Let me calculate that. 14 times 15 is 210 because 14 *10=140, 14*5=70, 140+70=210. So x is 15.\n\nSo x is 15. That's the number of newspapers bought on each of the other days, including Monday. So the hotel buys 15 newspapers on Monday. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. So on Sunday, they buy 2x = 30 newspapers. Sunday's cost is 30 *4 = $120. The other six days, each day is 15 newspapers, so 15 *1 = $15 per day. Six days would be 6*15 = 90 newspapers total, but wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the cost is per day. So each day's cost is $15. So six days would be 6 *15 = $90. So total cost is 120 +90=210, which matches the given amount. So that's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be 15 newspapers on Monday. Looking at the options, option A is 15. So the correct answer is A.\n",

So on Sunday, they buy 2x = 30 newspapers. Sunday's cost is 30 *4 = $120. The other six days, each day is 15 newspapers, so 15 *1 = $15 per day.

A hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as the other days. They pay $210 per week. The question is, how many newspapers do they buy on Monday?\n\nAlright, let's break it down. First, I need to find the number of newspapers bought on Monday. Let me think about the variables involved.\n\nLet's say the hotel buys 'x' newspapers each day from Monday to Saturday. Then, on Sunday, they buy twice as many, so that's 2x newspapers. Wait, but the problem says \"the rest of the days of the week.\" So, Monday to Saturday are six days, each with x newspapers. Sunday is 2x.\n\nWait, no, actually, the way the problem is phrased: \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" Oh, so maybe the rest of the days are all considered together. So perhaps the hotel buys a certain number each day on the other six days, and on Sunday, they double the total of those six days.\n\nWait, that's a different interpretation. So for example, if each of the six days (Mon-Sat) they buy x papers, the total for those six days is 6x. Then, on Sunday, they buy 2 * 6x = 12x. So that's one way. Alternatively, they could be buying twice as many on Sunday compared to each other day. So, like, each day is x, Sunday is 2x. Hmm, which interpretation is correct?\n\nThe problem says, \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" Oh, so it's comparing Sunday's quantity to the rest of the days. So \"rest of the days\" is plural. So perhaps Sunday's quantity is twice the sum of the rest of the days.\n\nWait, that would make more sense. So if the rest of the days (Mon-Sat) total X newspapers, then Sunday is 2X. So the total newspapers bought per week would be X (Mon-Sat) + 2X (Sun) = 3X.\n\nBut wait, that's not correct because each day has a certain number. Let me think again. Let me define variables more clearly.\n\nLet me define the number of newspapers bought on a non-Sunday day (like Monday) as x. So each of the six days (Mon-Sat) they buy x newspapers. So the total for those days is 6x. Then, on Sunday, they buy twice as many as the rest of the days, which would be 2*(6x) = 12x. So the total newspapers per week would be 6x + 12x = 18x.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the cost is $210. Let me think about the cost.\n\nThe cost on Sunday is $4 per paper, and $1 for the rest of the days. So the total cost would be:\n\nSunday: 12x newspapers * $4 = 48x dollars.\n\nNon-Sundays: 6x newspapers * $1 = 6x dollars.\n\nTotal cost per week: 48x + 6x = 54x.\n\nAnd the total cost is given as $210. So 54x = 210.\n\nSolving for x: x = 210 / 54. Let's calculate that.\n\nWait, 54 times 3 is 162, 54*4=216. 210 is between. So 210/54 = approximately 3.888. Hmm, but x has to be an integer because you can't buy a fraction of a newspaper. So that's a problem. Because 210 divided by 54 is 3.888... which is 3 and 8/9, but that's not possible.\n\nHmm, so maybe my initial assumption about the variables is wrong. Let's try another approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Perhaps the hotel buys x newspapers on each non-Sunday day. So each day from Monday to Saturday is x, which totals 6x. Sunday is twice as much as any single non-Sunday day, so 2x. So Sunday is 2x newspapers.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days.\" So if the rest of the days are each x, then Sunday is 2x. But that would mean that on Sunday, they buy twice as much as each other day. So the total newspapers per week would be 6x (Mon-Sat) + 2x (Sun) = 8x.\n\nBut wait, the cost would be:\n\nSunday: 2x * $4 = 8x.\n\nNon-Sundays: 6x * $1 = 6x.\n\nTotal cost: 8x + 6x = 14x.\n\nGiven that total cost is $210, 14x = 210 \u2192 x = 15.\n\nSo x is 15. That means on Monday, they buy x =15 newspapers. So the answer would be 15, option A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If each non-Sunday day is 15, then Sunday is 30. So total newspapers per week: 6*15 + 30 = 90 +30=120? No, wait, 6*15 is 90, plus 30 is 120. But cost is:\n\nSunday: 30 *4=120.\n\nNon-Sundays: 6*15=90 *1=90.\n\nTotal cost: 120 +90=210. Oh, that matches.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought Sunday was 12x, that didn't give an integer. So perhaps the correct way is that Sunday is twice as much as each of the other days, not the sum.\n\nSo that would mean that on each non-Sunday day, it's x, and Sunday is 2x. So total newspapers: 6x + 2x =8x.\n\nWait, but in that case, the total cost would be 6x *1 + 2x *4 = 6x +8x=14x. 14x=210 \u2192 x=15. So on Monday, they buy 15. So the correct answer is 15, option A.\n\nBut wait, another thought. The problem says \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" So \"rest of the days\" could be interpreted as the sum of all the other days. So, for example, if each non-Sunday day is x, then the sum is 6x. Sunday is 2*(6x) =12x.\n\nSo total newspapers: 6x +12x=18x.\n\nTotal cost: (6x)*1 + (12x)*4 =6x +48x=54x.\n\n54x=210 \u2192 x=210/54\u22483.888. But that's not possible. So this can't be correct.\n\nSo the initial approach must be correct, where Sunday is twice as much as each day, not the sum. So Sunday is 2x, non-Sundays are x each. So x=15, Monday is 15.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"twice as many on Sunday as it does the rest of the days.\" So the rest of the days are plural. So perhaps the correct interpretation is that Sunday's count is twice the sum of all the other days.\n\nSo if each of the other days is x, then their sum is 6x. Sunday is 2*(6x) =12x.\n\nSo total newspapers: 6x +12x=18x.\n\nTotal cost: 6x *1 + 12x *4=6x +48x=54x.\n\n54x=210 \u2192 x=210/54=3.888... which is not possible. So this can't be right.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the correct interpretation is that Sunday's quantity is twice the quantity of each of the other days. So for each non-Sunday day, it's x, so Sunday is 2x. So total newspapers per week: 6x +2x=8x.\n\nTotal cost: 6x*1 +2x*4=6x +8x=14x.\n\n14x=210 \u2192 x=15. So Monday is 15. So answer is A.\n\nSo that makes sense. So I think the correct answer is 15, option A.\n",

Hmm, I need to find out how many newspapers they buy on Monday.\n\nFirst, let's parse the information. The newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days. The hotel orders twice as many on Sunday as on the other days. And their total weekly payment is $210. The goal is to find Monday's newspapers.\n\nWait, wait. The rest of the days are Monday to Saturday, right? So that's six days. But the problem says \"the rest of the days of the week,\" which includes Monday to Saturday, I think. But the hotel orders a certain number each day, but on Sunday it's twice that number.\n\nLet me think about variables. Let's let x be the number of newspapers bought on each of the other days (Monday to Saturday). Then on Sunday, they buy 2x newspapers.\n\nWait, but how many days are we considering? Monday to Saturday is six days, and Sunday is one day. So the total number of newspapers bought during the week would be 6x (for the six days) plus 2x (for Sunday), making it 8x in total. But wait, no, wait a second. Wait, no, the cost is per day, so each of the other days is $1, and Sunday is $4. So the cost per day varies.\n\nSo the cost for each of the other days (Monday to Saturday) is $1 per paper. So if they buy x papers on each of these days, the cost per day is x * $1. Since there are six days, the total for these days is 6x * 1 = 6x dollars.\n\nOn Sunday, they buy twice as many, which is 2x papers. So the cost for Sunday is 2x * $4 = 8x dollars.\n\nSo the total weekly cost is the sum of the other days and Sunday: 6x + 8x = 14x dollars. And we know the total is $210, so 14x = 210.\n\nLet me solve for x. Dividing both sides by 14 gives x = 210 /14. Let's calculate that: 14 goes into 210. 14*15 is 210. So x is 15.\n\nSo on each of the other days (Monday to Saturday), the hotel buys x=15 newspapers. So on Monday, it's 15 newspapers.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check. Because the problem says the hotel buys twice as many on Sunday as on the other days. So if x is 15, then Sunday is 30. So the cost for the other days: 15 papers each day, 6 days, so 15*6 = 90. Sunday is 30 papers at $4 each: 30*4=120. Total is 90 + 120=210. Yes, that adds up.\n\nSo the answer should be 15. Looking at the options, option A is 15. So the answer is A.\n",

And the total they pay each week is $210. The question is, how many newspapers do they buy on Monday?\n\nHmm, okay. So I think I should set up some variables to represent the number of newspapers bought on different days.\n\nLet me think: let's say the number of newspapers bought on each of the other days (like Monday, Tuesday, etc.) is x. Then, since they buy twice as many on Sunday, the number on Sunday would be 2x.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014there's seven days in a week. Sunday is one day, and the rest are Monday to Saturday, which is six days. So on each of those six days, the hotel buys x newspapers.

So the total cost is the sum of all the costs for each day. So I shouldn't be adding up the number of newspapers, but rather the cost each day.\n\nRight. So each day from Monday to Saturday, the cost is $1 per newspaper, and the hotel buys x newspapers each day. So for each of those six days, the cost is x * $1 = $x per day. Since there are six days, that's 6 * x dollars.\n\nOn Sunday, they buy 2x newspapers at $4 each. So the cost for Sunday is 2x * $4 = $8x.\n\nAdding those together gives the total weekly cost: 6x + 8x = 14x. And the problem states that the total is $210 per week. So 14x = 210.\n\nTo find x, I can solve for x: x = 210 / 14. Let me calculate that. 14 times 15 is 210, right? Because 14*10 is 140, 14*5 is 70; 140+70=210.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a hotel ordering newspapers and I need to figure out how many they buy on Monday. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says the newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days. The hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as on the other days. And the total they pay per week is $210. So I need to find the number of newspapers on Monday.\n\nWait, so the days other than Sunday would be Monday to Saturday, right? So that's 6 days. But the problem says \"the rest of the days,\" so maybe it's considering each day except Sunday. So, let me clarify: the hotel buys a certain number each day, but on Sunday it's double that number.\n\nLet me set up some variables. Let's say the number of newspapers bought on a non-Sunday day (like Monday) is x. Then, on Sunday, they buy 2x because it's twice as much.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the total cost. So, for each day, the cost depends on when it is. For Sunday, each paper is $4, and for other days, it's $1.\n\nSo, let's compute the cost per day. On a non-Sunday day, each paper is $1, so x papers would cost $1 * x = $x per day. Since there are 6 such days (Monday to Saturday), the total cost for those days is 6 * x * $1 = 6x dollars.\n\nOn Sunday, they buy 2x papers at $4 each. So that's 2x * $4 = $8x.\n\nAdding the Sunday cost to the other days' cost gives the total weekly expense. So total cost is 6x + 8x = 14x. But wait, wait, no, hold on. Wait, no, wait. Because 6 days at $x each? No, wait, no. Wait, each day except Sunday has x papers. So for 6 days, that's 6 * x papers. But each of those is $1, so the cost is 6x * $1 = 6x dollars. Then, Sunday is 2x papers at $4 each, so that's 2x *4 = 8x. So total cost is 6x +8x =14x.\n\nBut the problem says the total is $210 per week. So 14x = 210.\n\nWait, solving for x: x = 210 /14 =15. So x is 15. So the hotel buys 15 newspapers on each of the non-Sunday days, including Monday.\n\nSo the answer should be 15, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. So 6 days at 15 papers each: 6 *15=90 papers. Sunday is 2*15=30. So total papers are 90+30=120.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a hotel ordering newspapers and I need to figure out how many they buy on Monday. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says the newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days. The hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as on the other days. And the total they pay per week is $210. So I need to find the number of newspapers on Monday.\n\nWait, so the days other than Sunday would be Monday to Saturday, right? So that's 6 days. But the problem says \"the rest of the days,\" so maybe it's considering each day except Sunday. So, let me clarify: the hotel buys a certain number each day, but on Sunday it's double that number.\n\nLet me set up some variables. Let's say the number of newspapers bought on a non-Sunday day (like Monday) is x. Then, on Sunday, they buy 2x because it's twice as much.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the total cost. So, for each day, the cost depends on when it is. For Sunday, each paper is $4, and for other days, it's $1.\n\nSo, let's compute the cost per day. On a non-Sunday day, each paper is $1, so x papers would cost $1 * x = $x per day. Since there are 6 such days (Monday to Saturday), the total cost for those days is 6 * x * $1 = 6x dollars.\n\nOn Sunday, they buy 2x papers at $4 each. So that's 2x * $4 = $8x.\n\nAdding the Sunday cost to the other days' cost gives the total weekly expense. So total cost is 6x + 8x = 14x. But wait, wait, no, hold on. Wait, no, wait. Because 6 days at $x each? No, wait, no. Wait, each day except Sunday has x papers. So for 6 days, that's 6 * x papers. But each of those is $1, so the cost is 6x * $1 = 6x dollars. Then, Sunday is 2x papers at $4 each, so that's 2x *4 = 8x. So total cost is 6x +8x =14x.\n\nBut the problem says the total is $210 per week. So 14x = 210.\n\nWait, solving for x: x = 210 /14 =15. So x is 15. So the hotel buys 15 newspapers on each of the non-Sunday days, including Monday.\n\nSo the answer should be 15, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. So 6 days at 15 papers each: 6 *15=90 papers. Sunday is 2*15=30. So total papers are 90+30=120. But that's not needed for the question, but just to make sure the costs add up.\n\nCost for non-Sundays: 6 days *15 papers * $1 = $90. Sunday: 30 papers * $4 = $120. Total is 90+120=210, which matches. So yes, x is 15. So Monday's newspapers are 15, option A.\n\n\nLet the number of newspapers bought on a non-Sunday day (e.g., Monday) be \\( x \\). On Sunday, the hotel buys twice as many newspapers, so it buys \\( 2x \\) newspapers on Sunday.\n\nThe cost of newspapers varies depending on the day: $1 per newspaper on non-Sunday days and $4 per newspaper on Sunday. \n\nFor the 6 non-Sunday days (Monday to Saturday), the total cost is:\n\\[\n6 \\times (x \\times 1) = 6x \\, \\text{dollars}.\n\\]\n\nOn Sunday, the cost for \\( 2x \\) newspapers is:\n\\[\n2x \\times 4 = 8x \\, \\text{dollars}.\n\\]\n\nThe total weekly cost is the sum of the costs for non-Sunday days and Sunday:\n\\[\n6x + 8x = 14x.\n\\]\n\nThe problem states that the total weekly cost is $210, so:\n\\[\n14x = 210.\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{210}{14} = 15.\n\\]\n\nThus, the hotel buys \\( x = 15 \\) newspapers on Monday.

Alright, let's break it down.\n\nSo, the newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days. The hotel orders twice as many on Sunday as on the other days. And their total payment per week is $210. The question is, how many do they buy on Monday?\n\nWait, so Monday is one of the non-Sunday days. So the cost for Monday is $1 per paper, same as Tuesday, Wednesday, etc.\n\nLet me think about variables. Let's say the number of newspapers bought on a non-Sunday day is x. Then on Sunday, they buy twice that, so 2x.\n\nNow, how many days are non-Sundays? Well, the week has 7 days, so 6 days are not Sunday. But wait, the problem says \"the rest of the days of the week,\" which I think refers to each day other than Sunday. So the cost is $1 for each of those days.\n\nWait, but does the hotel order the same number of papers each day except Sunday? Because the problem says \"twice as many on Sunday as it does the rest of the days.\" So I think that on each of the other days (Monday to Saturday), the hotel buys x newspapers. So each of those 6 days contributes x newspapers.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the rest of the days of the week,\" which could mean that the hotel buys x newspapers each of those days. So total non-Sunday papers would be 6x. Then, on Sunday, it's 2x.\n\nSo the total number of newspapers bought in a week would be 6x (from Monday to Saturday) plus 2x (Sunday) = 8x.\n\nBut wait, the cost is different for Sunday. So the cost calculation should consider the different prices.\n\nSo the cost per non-Sunday is $1 per paper. So for each of the 6 days, the cost is 1*x = x dollars. So total cost for non-Sundays is 6 * x dollars.\n\nOn Sunday, each paper is $4, and they buy 2x papers. So the cost for Sunday is 4 * 2x = 8x dollars.\n\nSo the total weekly cost is 6x (non-Sundays) + 8x (Sunday) = 14x dollars.\n\nAnd the problem states that the total is $210. So 14x = 210.\n\nSolving for x: x = 210 /14. Let me calculate that. 14 times 15 is 210, right? Because 14*10=140, 14*5=70, 140+70=210. So x=15.\n\nSo on each non-Sunday day, they buy 15 newspapers. That includes Monday, so the answer is 15.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the math. 15 per non-Sunday day. 6 days would be 15*6 =90 papers. Sunday is twice that, so 30. So 90+30=120 papers in total. But wait, the cost is different.\n\nWait, the cost for non-Sundays is 15 papers at $1 each, so 15*1 =15 per day, 6 days would be 15*6=90. Sunday: 30 papers at $4 each, so 30*4=120. So total cost is 90+120=210, which matches the given total. So yes, x is 15.\n\nSo the number on Monday is 15. Looking at the options, option A is 15.\n",

Let me think about that.\n\nWait, the question says \"the rest of the days of the week.\" So, the other six days. So, perhaps the total for Sunday is twice the total for the other six days. Because if x is the number per day for the other days, then the total for the other days would be 6x, and Sunday would be 2*(6x) = 12x?

Then, the cost for the other days is y * $1, and Sunday is 2y * $4 = $8y. So total cost is y +8y =9y = 210. So y=210/9 = 23.333... which is not an integer, so that can't be right because the number of newspapers should be whole numbers. So that interpretation probably isn't correct. So the first interpretation is more likely correct.\n\nSo, sticking with the first approach, the answer is 15, which is option A.\n\n\nLet\u2019s define variables to solve the problem:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of newspapers bought each day from Monday to Saturday.\n- On Sunday, the hotel buys twice as many newspapers as on any other day, so the number of newspapers on Sunday is \\( 2x \\).\n\nThe total number of newspapers bought in a week is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total newspapers} = 6x \\, (\\text{Monday to Saturday}) + 2x \\, (\\text{Sunday}) = 8x\n\\]\n\nThe cost of newspapers is calculated as follows:\n- On Sunday, each newspaper costs $4, so the cost for Sunday newspapers is \\( 2x \\times 4 = 8x \\) dollars.\n- On other days, each newspaper costs $1, so the cost for newspapers on Monday to Saturday is \\( 6x \\times 1 = 6x \\) dollars.\n\nThe total weekly cost is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 8x + 6x = 14x\n\\]\n\nThe hotel pays $210 per week, so:\n\\[\n14x = 210\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{210}{14} = 15\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of newspapers bought on Monday (a non-Sunday day) is \\( x = 15 \\).\n\nThe answer is **A) 15**.\n\nAnswer: A",
