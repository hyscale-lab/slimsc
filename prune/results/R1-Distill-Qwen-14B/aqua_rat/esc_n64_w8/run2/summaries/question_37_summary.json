      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, so the question is about a shopkeeper selling a watch with discounts and the effect on profit. I need to find the marked price of the watch. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, so the problem says that when the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, he makes a certain profit. But when he gives a 7% discount, his profit is Rs.15 less. So the difference between a 5% discount and a 7% discount leads to a Rs.15 decrease in profit.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, no. No, actually, wait. Profit is calculated based on the selling price, right? So the selling price after a discount affects the profit. But I think I need to know the cost price to figure this out. Because profit is selling price minus cost price.\n\nSo let me denote some variables to make this clearer. Let me say that the marked price (the original price before any discount) is M. The cost price is C. Then, when he gives a 5% discount, the selling price is 95% of M, which is 0.95*M. His profit in this case would be 0.95*M - C.\n\nSimilarly, when he gives a 7% discount, the selling price is 93% of M, which is 0.93*M. His profit here is 0.93*M - C.\n\nThe problem states that when he gives a 7% discount, he earns Rs.15 less than when he gives a 5% discount. So the difference between the two profits is Rs.15. So I can set up the equation:\n\n(0.95*M - C) - (0.93*M - C) = 15\n\nWait, let me make sure I have that right. Because the profit when giving 7% is less than the profit when giving 5%. So the first profit minus the second profit equals 15.\n\nSo expanding that equation: 0.95M - C - 0.93M + C = 15.\n\nWait, the C terms cancel out. So 0.95M -0.93M =15. That's 0.02M=15.\n\nSo M=15 / 0.02 = 750. Oh, so the marked price is Rs.750. Looking at the options, D is 750. So is that the answer?\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Because sometimes I might have mixed up the setup.\n\nWait, the profit difference is 15 when the discount increases by 2% (from 5% to 7%). So the difference in selling prices is 0.02M, which is exactly the 2% of M. So that difference in selling price is 15. So 0.02M=15 \u2192 M=750. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: The difference between 5% and 7% discount is 2%. The difference in selling prices is 2% of M. This difference is Rs.15. So 2% of M is 15, so M is 15/(0.02)=750. Yep, same result.\n\nSo the correct answer should be D) Rs.750.\n",

Hmm, the question says that when the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, he makes a certain profit. But when he gives a 7% discount, his profit is Rs. 15 less. I need to find the marked price of the watch.\n\nWait, right. The marked price is the original price before any discounts. So the shopkeeper is selling it at a discount, and depending on the discount percentage, his profit changes. The key here is that the cost price must remain the same in both scenarios because the watch is the same product.\n\nLet me think about the variables involved. Let's denote the marked price as M. The cost price is something else, maybe C. When he gives a 5% discount, the selling price is 95% of M, right? So that's 0.95 * M. His profit in this case would be selling price minus cost price, so 0.95M - C.\n\nIn the second scenario, when the discount is 7%, the selling price is 93% of M, which is 0.93 * M. His profit here is 0.93M - C. But the problem says this profit is Rs. 15 less than the previous profit. So the difference between the two profits is 15.\n\nSo setting up the equation: (0.95M - C) - (0.93M - C) = 15. Wait, that simplifies. Let me calculate that. The C terms cancel out. So 0.95M - 0.93M = 15. That gives 0.02M =15. So M is 15 divided by 0.02.\n\nWait, 15 divided by 0.02 is the same as 15 multiplied by 50. Because 1/0.02 is 50. So 15 *50 is 750. So M is 750. Let me look at the options. Option D is 750. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If M is 750, then 5% discount is 750 *0.05=37.5, so selling price is 750-37.5=712.5. Cost price is C. Profit is 712.5 - C.\n\nAt 7% discount, 750 *0.07=52.5, selling price is 750-52.5=697.5. Profit is 697.5 - C.\n\nThe difference between the two profits is (712.5 - C) - (697.5 - C) = 15. Yes, that's correct because 712.5 -697.5 is 15. So the cost price cancels out, and the difference is indeed 15. So yes, M is 750. So the correct answer is D.\n",

The problem says that when the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, he gets a certain profit. But when he gives a 7% discount, his profit is Rs. 15 less. I need to find the marked price of the watch.\n\nHmm, I remember that marked price is the price before any discount is applied. So, the selling price depends on the discount given. Let's think about variables. Let me denote the marked price as MP. \n\nWhen he gives a 5% discount, the selling price (SP1) would be MP minus 5% of MP, which is MP * (1 - 0.05) = 0.95 * MP.\n\nSimilarly, when he gives a 7% discount, the selling price (SP2) is MP * (1 - 0.07) = 0.93 * MP.\n\nNow, the problem states that the profit when giving a 7% discount is Rs. 15 less than when giving a 5% discount. Wait, profit is based on the cost price, right? So, the selling price minus the cost price equals profit. \n\nLet me assume that the cost price (CP) is fixed. So, the profit when selling at SP1 is SP1 - CP, and the profit when selling at SP2 is SP2 - CP. The difference between these two profits is Rs. 15, but I need to figure out which is larger. Since SP2 is lower than SP1 (because 7% discount is more than 5%), the profit when giving a 7% discount must be less. So, SP1 - CP - (SP2 - CP) = 15. That simplifies to SP1 - SP2 = 15.\n\nWait, let me write that down:\n\nProfit1 = SP1 - CP\nProfit2 = SP2 - CP\nSo, Profit1 - Profit2 = (SP1 - CP) - (SP2 - CP) = SP1 - SP2 = 15.\n\nSo, SP1 - SP2 = 15.\n\nWe know SP1 is 0.95*MP, SP2 is 0.93*MP.\n\nSo,\n\n0.95*MP - 0.93*MP = 15\nWhich simplifies to 0.02*MP = 15.\n\nSo, MP = 15 / 0.02 = 750.\n\nWait, that's one of the options.

The problem says he earns Rs.15 less as profit when giving 7% discount. So, the profit when 7% discount is (Profit when 5% discount) - 15. So yes, the difference between the two profits is 15. So, my calculation should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it in terms of cost price. Let's say the cost price is C. Then, SP1 = 0.95*MP, which equals C + Profit1. SP2 = 0.93*MP = C + Profit2. So, Profit1 = 0.95*MP - C. Profit2 = 0.93*MP - C.\n\nSo, Profit1 - Profit2 = (0.95 MP - C) - (0.93 MP - C) = 0.02 MP. And this difference is 15, so 0.02 MP =15 \u2192 MP=750. Yep, same result.\n\nSo the marked price is Rs.750, which is option D.\n",

Similarly, a 7% discount would make the selling price 0.93*M.\n\nNow, the problem says that when the discount is increased from 5% to 7%, the profit decreases by Rs. 15. So, the difference in profit between the two scenarios is Rs. 15.\n\nWait, but profit is calculated as selling price minus cost price. Oh, right, but the cost price is the same in both cases because it's the same watch. So, let me denote the cost price as C.\n\nSo, when the discount is 5%, the selling price is 0.95M, and the profit is 0.95M - C. When the discount is 7%, the selling price is 0.93M, and the profit is 0.93M - C.\n\nThe difference in profit between these two scenarios is (0.95M - C) - (0.93M - C) = 0.02M. And this difference is Rs. 15. So, 0.02M = 15.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the cost price C cancels out when you subtract the two profits. So the difference is purely based on the change in selling price due to the discount. \n\nSo, solving for M: 0.02M = 15 \u2192 M = 15 / 0.02 = 750.\n\nWait, so the marked price is Rs. 750. Looking at the options, option D is Rs. 750. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. So, let's plug M = 750 back into the profits.\n\nAt 5% discount, selling price is 750 * 0.95 = 712.5. Profit is 712.5 - C.\n\nAt 7% discount, selling price is 750 * 0.93 = 697.5. Profit is 697.5 - C.\n\nThe difference in profit is (712.5 - C) - (697.5 - C) = 15, which matches the given condition. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the marked price is Rs. 750, which is option D.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a shopkeeper selling a watch with discounts, and I need to find the marked price. Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nAlright, the problem says that when the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, he makes a certain profit. But if he gives a 7% discount instead, his profit is Rs. 15 less. The question is asking for the marked price of the watch.\n\nWait, wait. I think I remember that marked price is the original price before any discounts. So, when the shopkeeper gives a discount, the selling price decreases, which might affect the profit. But how exactly?\n\nLet me think. Profit is usually calculated as selling price minus cost price. Oh right, so the cost price is fixed, I guess. So, if the selling price changes due to the discount, the profit changes accordingly.\n\nLet me assign some variables. Let me call the marked price as M. The cost price is C. So, when he gives a 5% discount, the selling price is 95% of M, right? Because 100% minus 5% discount is 95%. So, SP1 = (95/100)*M.\n\nSimilarly, when the discount is 7%, the selling price is 93% of M. So, SP2 = (93/100)*M.\n\nNow, the profit in both cases would be SP minus cost price. So, profit when 5% discount is Profit1 = SP1 - C. Profit when 7% discount is Profit2 = SP2 - C.\n\nThe problem says that when he gives a 7% discount, he earns Rs.15 less. So, Profit1 - Profit2 = 15. Because Profit1 is higher than Profit2 by 15.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if the discount is higher, the selling price is lower, so the profit would be less. So, Profit2 is Profit1 minus 15. So, Profit1 - Profit2 = 15.\n\nSo, substituting the expressions:\n\n(SP1 - C) - (SP2 - C) = 15\n\nThe C's cancel out, so SP1 - SP2 =15.\n\nBut SP1 is (95/100)*M, SP2 is (93/100)*M. So:\n\n(95/100 M) - (93/100 M) = 15\n\nSimplify that: (95 - 93)/100 * M =15 \u2192 2/100 * M =15 \u2192 M=15*(100/2)=15*50=750.\n\nWait, so M is 750? So the marked price is Rs.750. Looking at the options, option D is 750. So is that the answer?\n\nWait, let me double-check. Because I might have made a mistake in the setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about the cost price. Because the difference in selling prices is equal to the difference in profits, because cost price is constant.\n\nSo, SP1 = 0.95M, SP2=0.93M. The difference is 0.02M, which equals 15.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a shopkeeper selling a watch with discounts, and I need to find the marked price. Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nAlright, the problem says that when the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, he makes a certain profit. But if he gives a 7% discount instead, his profit is Rs. 15 less. The question is asking for the marked price of the watch.\n\nWait, wait. I think I remember that marked price is the original price before any discounts. So, when the shopkeeper gives a discount, the selling price decreases, which might affect the profit. But how exactly?\n\nLet me think. Profit is usually calculated as selling price minus cost price. Oh right, so the cost price is fixed, I guess. So, if the selling price changes due to the discount, the profit changes accordingly.\n\nLet me assign some variables. Let me call the marked price as M. The cost price is C. So, when he gives a 5% discount, the selling price is 95% of M, right? Because 100% minus 5% discount is 95%. So, SP1 = (95/100)*M.\n\nSimilarly, when the discount is 7%, the selling price is 93% of M. So, SP2 = (93/100)*M.\n\nNow, the profit in both cases would be SP minus cost price. So, profit when 5% discount is Profit1 = SP1 - C. Profit when 7% discount is Profit2 = SP2 - C.\n\nThe problem says that when he gives a 7% discount, he earns Rs.15 less. So, Profit1 - Profit2 = 15. Because Profit1 is higher than Profit2 by 15.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if the discount is higher, the selling price is lower, so the profit would be less. So, Profit2 is Profit1 minus 15. So, Profit1 - Profit2 = 15.\n\nSo, substituting the expressions:\n\n(SP1 - C) - (SP2 - C) = 15\n\nThe C's cancel out, so SP1 - SP2 =15.\n\nBut SP1 is (95/100)*M, SP2 is (93/100)*M. So:\n\n(95/100 M) - (93/100 M) = 15\n\nSimplify that: (95 - 93)/100 * M =15 \u2192 2/100 * M =15 \u2192 M=15*(100/2)=15*50=750.\n\nWait, so M is 750? So the marked price is Rs.750. Looking at the options, option D is 750. So is that the answer?\n\nWait, let me double-check. Because I might have made a mistake in the setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about the cost price. Because the difference in selling prices is equal to the difference in profits, because cost price is constant.\n\nSo, SP1 = 0.95M, SP2=0.93M. The difference is 0.02M, which equals 15. So 0.02M =15 \u2192 M=15/0.02=750.

I'm a bit rusty on these types of problems, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nAlright, the problem says: When the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, he makes a certain profit. But when he gives a 7% discount, his profit is Rs. 15 less. I need to find the marked price of the watch.\n\nWait, what's the marked price? Oh right, that's the original price before any discounts. So, the selling price after discount would be based on this marked price.\n\nLet me denote the marked price as M. So when he gives a 5% discount, the selling price is M minus 5% of M. That would be 0.95 * M. Similarly, a 7% discount would make the selling price 0.93 * M.\n\nNow, the profit changes based on these selling prices. Profit is usually calculated as selling price minus cost price. But wait, the problem doesn't mention the cost price. Hmm, I think I need to figure that out.\n\nWait, maybe the profit difference is because the selling price is lower. So the difference in selling prices is 0.95M - 0.93M = 0.02M. And that difference is equal to Rs. 15 less in profit. So 0.02M = 15. Oh, that makes sense.\n\nSo if I solve for M, it should be M = 15 / 0.02. Let me calculate that. 15 divided by 0.02 is the same as 15 multiplied by 50, which is 750. So M is 750.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If M is 750, then a 5% discount would make the selling price 750 * 0.95 = 712.5. A 7% discount would be 750 * 0.93 = 697.5. The difference between these two is 712.5 - 697.5 = 15, which matches the problem statement. So that's correct.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is Rs. 750. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The problem says the shopkeeper \"earns Rs. 15 less as profit.\" So when he gives a bigger discount (7%), his profit is 15 less than when he gave a 5% discount. So the difference in the selling prices should be equal to 15. Which is what I did earlier.\n\nSo yeah, the marked price is 750. So the answer should be D.\n",
