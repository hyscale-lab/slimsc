      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a money pouch with Rs. 700. The coins are 25 paise, 50 paise, and one rupee coins. And they all have the same number of coins. Hmm, I need to find how many of each there are. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably convert everything into the same unit to make it easier. Since the total is in rupees, and the coins are in paise, maybe I should convert the total amount into paise. Oh right, because 1 rupee is 100 paise. So 700 rupees is 700 * 100 = 70,000 paise. That might make calculations simpler.\n\nNow, let's denote the number of each coin. Let's say the number of 25 paise coins is N. Since all are equal, the number of 50 paise coins is also N, and the same for one rupee coins. Wait, but wait, one rupee coins are 100 paise each, right? So each one is 100 paise.\n\nSo, the total amount from each type of coin would be:\n\n- 25 paise coins: N * 25\n- 50 paise coins: N * 50\n- 1 rupee coins: N * 100\n\nThe sum of all these should add up to 70,000 paise.\n\nSo the equation is: 25N + 50N + 100N = 70,000.\n\nLet me add those terms. 25+50=75, plus 100 is 175. So 175N = 70,000.\n\nTo find N, I'll divide both sides by 175. Let's do that: N = 70,000 / 175.\n\nHmm, what's 70,000 divided by 175? Let me calculate. 175 times 400 is 70,000 because 175*4 is 700, so 175*400 is 70,000. So N is 400.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check the options. The options are A)453, B)651, C)400, D)487, E)286. So option C is 400, which matches my calculation. So each type of coin is 400 pieces.\n\nWait, but the question is asking how many of each are there. So the answer is 400 each. Looking at the options, option C is 400. So that's the correct answer.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my steps. I converted the total to paise, set up the equation with equal numbers, solved for N, and it matches one of the options.\n",

So 25 paise, 50 paise, and 100 paise (since 1 rupee is 100 paise). \n\nWait, wait. Oh, no, wait. The coins are 25 paise, 50 paise, and 100 paise. Because 1 rupee is 100 paise.

Hmm, I need to find out how many of each coin there are. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should probably convert everything into the same unit to make calculations easier. Since the total is in rupees, maybe I should convert the coins into rupees as well. Oh right, because 25 paise is a quarter of a rupee, 50 paise is half, and one rupee is obviously one.\n\nSo, each type of coin has the same number, let's say the number of each coin is 'n'. That means there are n 25 paisa coins, n 50 paisa coins, and n 1-rupee coins.\n\nNow, calculating the total amount contributed by each type:\n\n- 25 paise coins: Each is 0.25 rupees, so total is 0.25 * n.\n- 50 paise coins: Each is 0.50 rupees, so total is 0.50 * n.\n- 1-rupee coins: Each is 1 rupee, so total is 1 * n.\n\nAdding all these together gives the total amount, which is 700 rupees. So the equation would be:\n\n0.25n + 0.50n + 1.00n = 700\n\nLet me add those up. 0.25 plus 0.50 is 0.75, plus 1 is 1.75. So the equation simplifies to:\n\n1.75n = 700\n\nTo find n, I can divide both sides by 1.75. Let's do that. 700 divided by 1.75. Hmm, maybe I can think of it as 700 divided by (7/4), since 1.75 is 7/4. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so 700 * (4/7).\n\nCalculating that: 700 divided by 7 is 100. Then 100 multiplied by 4 is 400. So n is 400.\n\nWait, so each type of coin has 400 pieces. So the total number of coins would be 3 times 400, which is 1200 coins, but the question is asking how many of each, so the answer would be 400 for each.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 400.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a money pouch with Rs. 700, and it says there are equal numbers of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins, and one rupee coins. Hmm, I need to find out how many of each coin there are. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should probably convert everything into the same unit to make calculations easier. Since the total is in rupees, maybe I should convert the coins into rupees as well. Oh right, because 25 paise is a quarter of a rupee, 50 paise is half, and one rupee is obviously one.\n\nSo, each type of coin has the same number, let's say the number of each coin is 'n'. That means there are n 25 paisa coins, n 50 paisa coins, and n 1-rupee coins.\n\nNow, calculating the total amount contributed by each type:\n\n- 25 paise coins: Each is 0.25 rupees, so total is 0.25 * n.\n- 50 paise coins: Each is 0.50 rupees, so total is 0.50 * n.\n- 1-rupee coins: Each is 1 rupee, so total is 1 * n.\n\nAdding all these together gives the total amount, which is 700 rupees. So the equation would be:\n\n0.25n + 0.50n + 1.00n = 700\n\nLet me add those up. 0.25 plus 0.50 is 0.75, plus 1 is 1.75. So the equation simplifies to:\n\n1.75n = 700\n\nTo find n, I can divide both sides by 1.75. Let's do that. 700 divided by 1.75. Hmm, maybe I can think of it as 700 divided by (7/4), since 1.75 is 7/4. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so 700 * (4/7).\n\nCalculating that: 700 divided by 7 is 100. Then 100 multiplied by 4 is 400. So n is 400.\n\nWait, so each type of coin has 400 pieces. So the total number of coins would be 3 times 400, which is 1200 coins, but the question is asking how many of each, so the answer would be 400 for each.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 400. So the answer should be C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by letting the number of each type of coin (25 paise, 50 paise, and 1 rupee) be \\( n \\). Converting the coins to rupees:\n\n- 25 paise = \\( 0.25 \\) rupees, so the total value of 25 paise coins is \\( 0.25n \\).\n- 50 paise = \\( 0.50 \\) rupees, so the total value of 50 paise coins is \\( 0.50n \\).\n- 1 rupee = \\( 1.00 \\) rupee, so the total value of 1-rupee coins is \\( 1.00n \\).\n\nThe total amount in the pouch is the sum of these values:\n\n\\[\n0.25n + 0.50n + 1.00n = 700\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left-hand side:\n\n\\[\n1.75n = 700\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( n \\), divide both sides by 1.75:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{700}{1.75} = 400\n\\]\n\nThus, there are 400 coins of each type.

The question says that there's a money pouch with Rs. 700, and the number of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins, and one rupee coins are all equal. I need to find out how many of each coin there are.\n\nHmm, let me start by understanding the units. The coins are in paise and rupees. I know that 1 rupee is equal to 100 paise. So, when the problem talks about one rupee coins, each of those is worth 100 paise.\n\nLet's denote the number of each type of coin as 'n'. So, there are 'n' 25 paise coins, 'n' 50 paise coins, and 'n' one rupee coins.\n\nNow, the total value from each type of coin would be:\n- 25 paise coins contribute 25 * n paise.\n- 50 paise coins contribute 50 * n paise.\n- One rupee coins contribute 100 * n paise each, but since the total is in rupees, maybe I should convert everything to paise first for easier calculation.\n\nThe total amount is 700 rupees, which is 700 * 100 = 70,000 paise.\n\nSo, the sum of the values from each coin type should add up to 70,000 paise. Let me write that as an equation.\n\n25n + 50n + 100n = 70,000\n\nWait, wait. Let me make sure. Each 25 paise coin is 0.25 rupees, but since we're working in paise, 25 paise is 0.25 * 100 = 25 p. So, yeah, 25n paise.\n\nSo, adding them up:\n\n25n + 50n + 100n = 70,000\n\nCombining like terms, that's (25 + 50 + 100) n = 70,000.\n\n25+50 is 75, plus 100 is 175. So, 175n =70,000.\n\nTo find n, I'll divide both sides by 175.\n\nn = 70,000 / 175.\n\nLet me compute that. Hmm, 175 times 400 is 70,000 because 175 * 400 = 70,000. Oh wait, wait. Let me check: 175 * 400 is 70,000. Because 175*4=700, so 175*400=70000. So yes, n is 400.\n\nSo, each type of coin has 400 pieces. Let me check the options. The options are A)453, B)651, C)400, D)487, E)286.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be option C)400.\n",
