      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the company makes 420 units each month, and each unit costs them $110 to produce. They sell all of them every month. We need to find the minimum selling price per component so that the yearly profit is at least $626,400.\n\nHmm, wait, profit is revenue minus production costs. Right. So first, I should calculate the total production cost per month, then figure out the revenue needed per month to reach the desired yearly profit.\n\nWait, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the company produces 420 units a month. Each unit costs $110. So the monthly production cost is 420 * 110. Let me calculate that.\n\n420 * 110. Let's see, 400*110 is 44,000, and 20*110 is 2,200. So 44,000 + 2,200 = 46,200. So monthly cost is $46,200.\n\nThey do this every month, so the annual production cost would be 46,200 * 12. Let me compute that. 46,200 times 12. Well, 46,200 * 10 is 462,000, and 46,200 *2 is 92,400. Adding them together gives 462,000 +92,400 = 554,400. So the total cost per year is $554,400.\n\nBut wait, the profit needs to be at least $626,400. So the total revenue needed is cost plus profit. So revenue = cost + profit.\n\nSo revenue required is 554,400 + 626,400. Let me add those numbers. 554,400 + 626,400. Let's see, 554k plus 626k is 1,180,800. So total revenue needed per year is $1,180,800.\n\nBut wait, that's the annual revenue. So per month, the revenue should be 1,180,800 divided by 12 months. Let me calculate that.\n\n1,180,800 \u00f7 12. Let's see, 12 \u00d7 98,400 is 1,180,800. Because 12 \u00d7 100,000 is 1.2 million, which is 120,000 more than 1,180,800. So 100,000 - (120,000 /12)= 100,000 -10,000=90,000? Wait no, maybe better to just do the division.\n\nWait, 12 \u00d7 98,000 is 1,176,000. The difference is 1,180,800 -1,176,000=4,800. 4,800 \u00f712=400. So 98,000 +400=98,400. So per month, the revenue needs to be $98,400.\n\nSo each month, they need to make $98,400 from selling 420 units. So the selling price per unit would be total revenue per month divided by number of units.\n\nSo 98,400 divided by 420. Let me calculate that.\n\n98,400 \u00f7420. Hmm, maybe simplify the numbers. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 10: 9,840 \u00f742.\n\nWait, 42 \u00d7 234 is 9,828 (because 42 \u00d7200=8400, 42\u00d734=1428, 8400+1428=9828). But 9,840 is 12 more than 9,828. So 234 + (12/42) = 234 + 2/7 \u2248 234.2857. So approximately $234.29 per unit.\n\nWait, but the options are in whole numbers. So looking at the options, the closest higher number would be 230, 240, etc. Wait, 234.2857 is approximately 234.29, so the minimum price per unit should be higher than that to make sure the profit is at least 626,400.\n\nLooking at the options, the next higher whole number would be 230. Wait, wait, but 230 is lower than 234.29, so that would not be enough. So the next option is 240.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternative approach: Compute the required selling price per unit.\n\nProfit per year is revenue minus cost. So Profit = (Selling Price * Units per month * 12) - (Cost per unit * Units per month *12).\n\nSo Profit = (P *420 *12 ) - (110 *420 *12). We need this to be >=626,400.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n(420 *12)(P -110) >=626,400.\n\nCompute 420 *12 = 5040.\n\nSo 5040*(P-110) >=626,400.\n\nDivide both sides by 5040: (P-110) >=626,400 /5040.\n\nLet me compute 626,400 \u00f75040.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: 62,640 \u00f7504.\n\nHmm, 504 \u00d7 124 is let's see: 504 \u00d7100=50,400; 504\u00d724=12,096. So 50,400+12,096=62,496. That's 504 \u00d7124=62,496.\n\nThe numerator is 62,640. So 62,640 -62,496 =144. So 144 \u00f7504 =0.2857.\n\nSo 62,640 \u00f7504=124 + 0.2857\u2248124.2857.\n\nSo P-110 >=124.2857.\n\nThus, P >=110 +124.2857 =234.2857.\n\nSo P must be at least approximately $234.29. Since we can't sell for a fraction of a dollar, the next whole dollar is $235, but the options don't have 235. So looking at the options, the possible answers are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nWait, 234.29 is the minimum. So the options are 226 (too low), 230 (still too low, because 230 <234.29), 240 is the next higher option. So the minimum price per unit that guarantees the profit is $240.\n\nWait, but wait: let me calculate the profit if the price is $230. Let's see if that's enough.\n\nIf P is 230, then per unit, the profit is 230 -110=120. So per unit profit is $120. They produce 420 units per month, so monthly profit is 420 *120=50,400. Yearly profit is 50,400 *12=604,800. But we need at least 626,400. So 604,800 is less than 626,400. So 230 is insufficient.\n\nWhat about 240? Let's calculate. 240-110=130 profit per unit. 420 *130=54,600 per month. 54,600 *12=655,200. Which is more than 626,400. So yes, 240 would be sufficient.\n\nWait, but is there a lower price than 240 that would still meet the required profit? The next option after 230 is 240, which works. So the minimum is 240.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if 234.29 is the exact point. So any price above that would work. But the options don't have that. So the next higher option is 240.\n\nSo the correct answer must be C)240.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out the minimum selling price per component that a company should set to guarantee a certain yearly profit. Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nThe company produces 420 units every month. Each unit costs them $110 to produce. They sell all of them by the end of each month. The goal is to find the minimum price per component so that the yearly profit is at least $626,400. Profit is calculated as revenue minus production costs.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. First, I need to figure out the total production cost per month and then the total for the year. Then, I'll calculate the revenue needed each year and find out what the selling price should be.\n\nSo, the company produces 420 units a month. Each unit costs $110. So monthly production cost is 420 multiplied by 110. Let me compute that: 420 * 110. Hmm, 420 * 100 is 42,000, and 420 * 10 is 4,200. So together, 42,000 + 4,200 = 46,200. So each month they spend $46,200 on production.\n\nSince there are 12 months in a year, the annual production cost would be 46,200 * 12. Let me calculate that. 46,200 * 10 is 462,000, and 46,200 * 2 is 92,400. So adding those together gives 554,400. So the total yearly cost is $554,400.\n\nNow, the desired profit is $626,400. So the total revenue they need each year is the sum of the cost and the desired profit. So revenue needed = 554,400 + 626,400. Let me add those: 554,400 plus 626,400. 554k + 626k is 1,180,800. So 1,180,800 dollars in revenue per year.\n\nWait, no, wait. Because profit is revenue minus cost, right? So if they need a profit of at least $626,400, then revenue must be cost plus profit. So yes, that's correct: 554,400 + 626,400 = 1,180,800.\n\nSo, total revenue needed per year is $1,180,800.\n\nNow, the company sells all 420 units each month. So the number of units sold per year is 420 * 12. Let me compute that: 420 * 10 is 4,200, 420 * 2 is 840. So 4,200 + 840 = 5,040 units per year.\n\nSo, they need to make $1,180,800 revenue from selling 5,040 units. To find the minimum selling price per unit, I can divide the total revenue needed by the number of units sold.\n\nSo price per unit = 1,180,800 / 5,040.\n\nLet me compute that. Let's see, 5,040 goes into 1,180,800 how many times. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to simplify the division.\n\nLet me write it as 1,180,800 \u00f7 5,040.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can simplify both numbers by dividing numerator and denominator by 10 to make it 118,080 \u00f7 504.\n\nWait, 504 times 200 is 100,800. Because 504 * 200 = 100,800. Then, 118,080 minus 100,800 is 17,280. So 504 goes into 17,280 how many times?\n\nWait, 504 * 34 is 17,136. Because 504 *30=15,120. 504*4=2,016. So 15,120 +2,016=17,136. Subtracting that from 17,280 leaves 144. 504 goes into 144 0.2857 times (since 144/504 is 12/42=2/7\u22480.2857). So that would give 34.2857 times, so total so far is 200 +34.2857=234.2857.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 504*234 is 504*(200+34) = 100,800 + (504*34). Let's compute 504*34. 500*34=17,000, 4*34=136. So 17,000 +136=17,136. So 504*234=100,800 +17,136=117,936. The numerator is 118,080. 117,936 + 144=118,080. So 504*234 + 144 = 118,080. So 504 goes into 118,080 234 + (144/504) times. 144/504 is 12/42 = 2/7 \u22480.2857. So 234.2857.\n\nWait, but that would make the price per unit approximately $234.29. But looking at the options, the closest higher value is 230 and 240.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in the division.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute 1,180,800 \u00f75,040 by canceling zeros. 1,180,800 divided by 5,040. Let's see, both numbers can be divided by 10, so 118,080 / 504. Hmm, 504 \u00d7 200 is 100,800. 504 \u00d7 234 is 504*(200+34)=100,800 +504*34=100,800 + 17,136=117,936. 118,080 -117,936=144. So 504 \u00d7 (234 + 144/504) = 234 + 0.2857=234.2857. So the price per unit is approximately $234.29.\n\nBut wait, the options are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280. So 234.29 is between 230 and 240. So the minimum price is the next higher value, which is 240. Because they can't sell at a lower price than 234.29 and still make the required profit. So the minimum price would be 240, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me recalculate.\n\nAnother approach: Let me compute 5,040 units per year. The total revenue needed is $1,180,800. So the price per unit is 1,180,800 /5,040. Let me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, 5,040 \u00d7 200 = 1,008,000.\n\nSubtracting that from 1,180,800 gives 172,800.\n\nThen, 5,040 \u00d7 30 = 151,200.\n\nSo 200 +30=230. 1,008,000 +151,200=1,159,200. Remaining is 1,180,800 -1,159,200=21,600.\n\nNow, 5,040 \u00d74=20,160.\n\nSo 230+4=234. 1,159,200+20,160=1,179,360. Remaining is 1,180,800 -1,179,360=1,440.\n\n5,040 \u00d7 0.2857 \u22481,440 (since 5,040 \u00d70.2857 is about 1,440). So the total is 234.2857, same as before.\n\nSo that's approximately $234.29 per unit.\n\nBut looking at the options, the next higher price is 240. So the minimum price they can set is 240, which is option C. Because if they set it at 234.29, they'd make exactly the required profit, but since they can't set a fraction of a dollar, perhaps the problem expects a whole number. Or maybe I made a mistake in calculations.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the calculation should be done per month. Let me try that.\n\nThe company wants a yearly profit of $626,400. Let's see what profit they need each month.\n\nWait, no, because the profit is calculated as revenue minus cost. So each month, their profit is (price per unit \u00d7 420) minus (420 \u00d7110). The total profit over 12 months needs to be at least 626,400.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the required profit per month and then find the price.\n\nSo, total profit needed per year: 626,400. So per month, that's 626,400 /12 = 52,200 per month.\n\nEach month, the cost is 420 \u00d7110 = 46,200.\n\nSo profit per month is revenue minus 46,200. So revenue per month must be 46,200 +52,200 =98,400.\n\nSo, per month, they need to make $98,400.\n\nThe number of units sold each month is 420, so the price per unit is 98,400 /420.\n\nLet me compute that. 98,400 \u00f7420.\n\nDividing both numerator and denominator by 10: 9,840 /42.\n\nHmm, 42 \u00d7 200 =8,400. 9,840-8,400=1,440.\n\n42 \u00d734=1,428. So 200 +34=234. 8,400 +1,428=9,828. 9,840 -9,828=12.\n\nSo 42 \u00d7 (234) +12 =9,840. So 234 with a remainder of 12. So 234 + 12/42 = 234 + 2/7 \u2248234.2857.\n\nSame as before. So the price per unit must be at least approximately $234.29.\n\nLooking at the options, the next higher price is 240. So the minimum price is 240, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me check if 230 is an option. Because 230 is lower than 234.29, which wouldn't be enough. So option B is 230, which is too low. So the correct answer is C)240.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out the minimum selling price per component that a company should set to guarantee a certain yearly profit. Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nThe company produces 420 units every month. Each unit costs them $110 to produce. They sell all of them by the end of each month. The goal is to find the minimum price per component so that the yearly profit is at least $626,400. Profit is calculated as revenue minus production costs.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. First, I need to figure out the total production cost per month and then the total for the year. Then, I'll calculate the revenue needed each year and find out what the selling price should be.\n\nSo, the company produces 420 units a month. Each unit costs $110. So monthly production cost is 420 multiplied by 110. Let me compute that: 420 * 110. Hmm, 420 * 100 is 42,000, and 420 * 10 is 4,200. So together, 42,000 + 4,200 = 46,200. So each month they spend $46,200 on production.\n\nSince there are 12 months in a year, the annual production cost would be 46,200 * 12. Let me calculate that. 46,200 * 10 is 462,000, and 46,200 * 2 is 92,400. So adding those together gives 554,400. So the total yearly cost is $554,400.\n\nNow, the desired profit is $626,400. So the total revenue they need each year is the sum of the cost and the desired profit. So revenue needed = 554,400 + 626,400. Let me add those: 554,400 plus 626,400. 554k + 626k is 1,180,800. So 1,180,800 dollars in revenue per year.\n\nWait, no, wait. Because profit is revenue minus cost, right? So if they need a profit of at least $626,400, then revenue must be cost plus profit. So yes, that's correct: 554,400 + 626,400 = 1,180,800.\n\nSo, total revenue needed per year is $1,180,800.\n\nNow, the company sells all 420 units each month. So the number of units sold per year is 420 * 12. Let me compute that: 420 * 10 is 4,200, 420 * 2 is 840. So 4,200 + 840 = 5,040 units per year.\n\nSo, they need to make $1,180,800 revenue from selling 5,040 units. To find the minimum selling price per unit, I can divide the total revenue needed by the number of units sold.\n\nSo price per unit = 1,180,800 / 5,040.\n\nLet me compute that. Let's see, 5,040 goes into 1,180,800 how many times. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to simplify the division.\n\nLet me write it as 1,180,800 \u00f7 5,040.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can simplify both numbers by dividing numerator and denominator by 10 to make it 118,080 \u00f7 504.\n\nWait, 504 times 200 is 100,800. Because 504 * 200 = 100,800. Then, 118,080 minus 100,800 is 17,280. So 504 goes into 17,280 how many times?\n\nWait, 504 * 34 is 17,136. Because 504 *30=15,120. 504*4=2,016. So 15,120 +2,016=17,136. Subtracting that from 17,280 leaves 144. 504 goes into 144 0.2857 times (since 144/504 is 12/42=2/7\u22480.2857). So that would give 34.2857 times, so total so far is 200 +34.2857=234.2857.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 504*234 is 504*(200+34) = 100,800 + (504*34). Let's compute 504*34. 500*34=17,000, 4*34=136. So 17,000 +136=17,136. So 504*234=100,800 +17,136=117,936. The numerator is 118,080. 117,936 + 144=118,080. So 504*234 + 144 = 118,080. So 504 goes into 118,080 234 + (144/504) times. 144/504 is 12/42 = 2/7 \u22480.2857. So 234.2857.\n\nWait, but that would make the price per unit approximately $234.29. But looking at the options, the closest higher value is 230 and 240.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in the division.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute 1,180,800 \u00f75,040 by canceling zeros. 1,180,800 divided by 5,040. Let's see, both numbers can be divided by 10, so 118,080 / 504. Hmm, 504 \u00d7 200 is 100,800. 504 \u00d7 234 is 504*(200+34)=100,800 +504*34=100,800 + 17,136=117,936. 118,080 -117,936=144. So 504 \u00d7 (234 + 144/504) = 234 + 0.2857=234.2857. So the price per unit is approximately $234.29.\n\nBut wait, the options are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280. So 234.29 is between 230 and 240. So the minimum price is the next higher value, which is 240. Because they can't sell at a lower price than 234.29 and still make the required profit.

Remaining is 1,180,800 -1,159,200=21,600.\n\nNow, 5,040 \u00d74=20,160.\n\nSo 230+4=234. 1,159,200+20,160=1,179,360. Remaining is 1,180,800 -1,179,360=1,440.\n\n5,040 \u00d7 0.2857 \u22481,440 (since 5,040 \u00d70.2857 is about 1,440). So the total is 234.2857, same as before.\n\nSo that's approximately $234.29 per unit.\n\nBut looking at the options, the next higher price is 240.

So per month, that's 626,400 /12 = 52,200 per month.\n\nEach month, the cost is 420 \u00d7110 = 46,200.\n\nSo profit per month is revenue minus 46,200. So revenue per month must be 46,200 +52,200 =98,400.\n\nSo, per month, they need to make $98,400.\n\nThe number of units sold each month is 420, so the price per unit is 98,400 /420.\n\nLet me compute that. 98,400 \u00f7420.\n\nDividing both numerator and denominator by 10: 9,840 /42.\n\nHmm, 42 \u00d7 200 =8,400. 9,840-8,400=1,440.\n\n42 \u00d734=1,428.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a company producing computer components. Hmm, let me try to understand what's being asked. The company makes 420 units every month, and each unit costs them $110 to produce. They sell all of them each month. We need to find the minimum selling price per component so that their yearly profit is at least $626,400.\n\nWait, profit is revenue minus costs, right? So I guess I need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total production cost to get the profit. And this profit has to be at least $626,400 annually.\n\nLet me break it down step by step. First, find out how much they produce in a year. They make 420 units a month, so that's 12 times 420. Let me compute that. 420 * 12. Hmm, 400*12 is 4800, and 20*12 is 240, so total is 5040 units per year.\n\nNow, the cost per unit is $110. So the total production cost for the year would be 5040 units multiplied by $110 each. Let me calculate that. 5040 * 110. Wait, 5040 * 100 is 504,000, and 5040 *10 is 50,400. So adding those together gives 554,400. So total cost is $554,400 per year.\n\nThe desired profit is $626,400. So the total revenue needed would be total cost plus desired profit. So 554,400 + 626,400. Let's add those. 554k plus 626k is 1,180,800. So total revenue needs to be at least $1,180,800 per year.\n\nRevenue is the number of units sold multiplied by the selling price per unit. So revenue = 5040 * price. We need this to be >= 1,180,800.\n\nSo, solving for price: price >= 1,180,800 / 5040. Let me compute that division. Hmm, 5040 into 1,180,800. Let me see, 5040 times 200 is 1,008,000. Subtract that from 1,180,800, which leaves 172,800. Now, 5040 *34 is 5040*30=151200, 5040*4=20160. So 151200+20160=171360. Adding that to 200 gives 234, but wait, 171360 is less than 172800. Hmm, let me see, 5040 *34 = 171,360. So 172,800 - 171,360 = 1,440 left. 5040 goes into 1,440 how many times? 1440 /5040 is 0.2857 times, so about 0.2857. So the total would be 200 + 34 + 0.2857 \u2248 234.2857.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the division. Maybe I should compute 1,180,800 \u00f7 5040. Another approach: 1,180,800 \u00f7 5040. Let's see, 5040 is 5.04 * 10^3. 1,180,800 is 1.1808 *10^6. So 1.1808e6 / 5.04e3 = (1.1808 /5.04) * 10^(6-3) )= (0.2342857) * 10^3 = 234.2857. So approximately $234.29 per unit.\n\nBut wait, the options given are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280. Hmm, 234.29 isn't among the options. So I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through the calculations again.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I messed up the total cost. Let me recheck that. The company produces 420 units per month. So yearly production is 420 *12=5040, that's correct. The cost per component is $110, so 5040 *110. Let me compute that again. 5040 *100 is 504,000. 5040 *10 is 50,400. So 504,000 + 50,400= 554,400. That's correct.\n\nDesired profit is 626,400. So total revenue needed is 554,400 +626,400= 1,180,800. Correct.\n\nSo revenue per unit is 1,180,800 /5040 = let me compute that again. 1,180,800 \u00f7 5040. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 100 to make it easier: 11,808 \u00f7 50.4. Hmm, 50.4 times 234 is 50.4*200=10,080; 50.4*34=1,713.6. So 10,080 +1,713.6= 11,793.6. Hmm, that's close to 11,808. The difference is 11,808 -11,793.6= 14.4. So 14.4 /50.4 = 0.2857. So total is 234.2857, as before. So around $234.29 per unit.\n\nBut none of the options is close to that. So I must have made a mistake in my approach. Wait, maybe the question is about the minimum price per unit that gives the profit each month, and then over a year it sums up? No, the problem says \"yearly profit\", so I think the correct approach is to calculate the annual profit.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the monthly profit and then multiply by 12. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo each month, the company produces 420 units. Let's say the selling price is P per unit. Their revenue each month is 420*P. Their cost each month is 420*110=46,200. So monthly profit is (420P - 46,200). Then, the yearly profit would be 12*(420P -46,200).\n\nWe want this to be at least 626,400. So:\n\n12*(420P -46,200) >= 626,400.\n\nDivide both sides by 12: 420P -46,200 >= 52,200.\n\nThen, 420P >= 52,200 +46,200 =98,400.\n\nSo P >= 98,400 /420. Let me compute that: 98,400 \u00f7420.\n\nWell, 420 *234 = let me compute 420*200=84,000; 420*34=14,280. So 84,000+14,280=98,280. Then, 98,400-98,280=120. So 120/420 is 0.2857. So P >= 234.2857. Again, same result as before.\n\nBut the options are 226, 230, 240, etc. Hmm. So maybe I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says \"yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400.\"\n\nWait, is the production cost per unit $110, so total cost is 5040*110=554,400 per year. So the profit is (total revenue) - (total cost) >=626,400.\n\nTotal revenue is 5040*P. So:\n\n5040 P - 554,400 >=626,400.\n\nSo 5040 P >= 626,400 +554,400 = 1,180,800.\n\nThus, P >= 1,180,800 /5040 =234.2857.\n\nSo the minimum price per unit is approximately $234.29.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So perhaps the options are incorrect, but more likely I made a mistake in my calculations. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the minimum selling price that would give a profit of at least $626,400 per month? Wait, but the question says \"yearly profit\".\n\nWait, wait, perhaps the profit is per month. No, the question says \"yearly profit\".\n\nWait, perhaps I should recalculate 1,180,800 \u00f75040.\n\nLet me do that division more accurately.\n\n1,180,800 divided by 5040.\n\n5040 \u00d7 234 = 5040 \u00d7 (200 +34) = 5040\u00d7200=1,008,000; 5040\u00d734.\n\nCompute 5040 \u00d730=151,200; 5040\u00d74=20,160. So 151,200+20,160=171,360.\n\nSo 5040 \u00d734 =171,360. So 5040\u00d7234=1,008,000 +171,360=1,179,360.\n\nSo 1,179,360 is 5040\u00d7234.\n\nNow, 1,180,800 -1,179,360=1,440.\n\nSo 1,440 /5040 = 0.2857. So P=234.2857.\n\nHmm, that's about $234.29.\n\nBut looking at the options, the closest one is B)230, which is lower, and C)240, which is higher. Since the required price is about $234.29, which is between 230 and 240. But wait, the options don't have 234. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the company sells all components each month, so perhaps the profit is calculated per month, and then multiplied by 12 to get the annual profit.\n\nWait, let me try the approach again. Let me compute the required profit per month.\n\nSo the total desired profit is $626,400 per year, so per month it's 626,400 /12=52,200.\n\nEach month, the company sells 420 units. Their cost per month is 420 \u00d7110=46,200.\n\nSo the required profit per month is 52,200.\n\nSo, monthly profit = (420 \u00d7 P) -46,200 >=52,200.\n\nSo, 420 P >=52,200 +46,200 =98,400.\n\nSo, P >=98,400 /420.\n\nCompute that: 98,400 \u00f7420.\n\nLet me see, 420 \u00d7234=98,280 (as before). 98,400 -98,280=120. 120/420= 0.2857. So P>=234.2857.\n\nSame result as before. So again, the price per unit must be at least approximately $234.29.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So maybe I messed up the initial problem understanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum price so that the profit is at least $626,400 per month? Then that would change things. Let me see.\n\nIf that were the case, the monthly profit would be 626,400. Then the equation would be:\n\n420 P -46,200 >=626,400.\n\nSo, 420 P >=626,400 +46,200=672,600.\n\nP >=672,600 /420. Let me compute that: 672,600 \u00f7420.\n\n420 \u00d71600=672,000. 672,600-672,000=600. 600/420=1.4286. So P=1601.4286. Which is way higher than any of the options, so that can't be right.\n\nSo the original approach is correct. The problem must be that the options are wrong, but more likely I've made a mistake somewhere else.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says the company produces 420 units every month and sells them all, but maybe the selling price is per component, and perhaps I should compute the revenue correctly.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe I should calculate the total revenue per month, subtract the monthly cost, then multiply by 12 to get the annual profit.\n\nWait, no, that's what I did earlier. So the calculation seems correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the question says the company's production cost is $110 per component, which includes all costs. So the total cost per year is 5040 \u00d7110=554,400.\n\nSo the required revenue is 554,400 +626,400=1,180,800.\n\nSo per unit, 1,180,800 /5040= 234.2857.\n\nHmm. So the minimum price is about $234.29.\n\nBut the options don't include this. The closest options are B)230 and C)240. Since 234.29 is between 230 and 240, but the question asks for the minimum price that guarantees the profit. So the price must be at least 234.29, so the next higher option is 240 (option C). But that would give a higher profit than needed, which would be acceptable.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check what happens if the price is 230. Let me compute the profit.\n\nAt 230 per unit, revenue per year is 5040 \u00d7230= let's see, 5040 \u00d7200=1,008,000; 5040 \u00d730=151,200. Total=1,159,200.\n\nTotal cost is 554,400. Profit would be 1,159,200 -554,400=604,800.\n\nWhich is less than the desired 626,400. So 230 is insufficient.\n\nIf the price is 240, revenue is 5040 \u00d7240. 5040 \u00d7200=1,008,000; 5040 \u00d740=201,600. Total=1,209,600.\n\nProfit: 1,209,600 -554,400=655,200, which is above 626,400. So the minimum price is 234.29, but since the options don't have that, the next higher is 240, which would work. So option C is the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, why isn't 230 correct? Because at 230, the profit is lower than required. So the minimum price must be higher than 234.29, so the next option is 240.\n\nBut looking at the options again, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the problem says the company's production cost is $110 per component. So that's correct. So the total cost is 420 *12 *110 =5040 *110=554,400.\n\nSo, 5040 *P -554,400 >=626,400 \u2192 5040 P >=1,180,800 \u2192 P >=234.2857.\n\nSo the minimum price is approximately $234.29. But since the options don't have this, perhaps the correct answer is not present. But the options given are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the total number of units produced annually. Let me check that again. 420 units per month \u00d712 months=5040 units. Correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check the division 1,180,800 \u00f75040.\n\nLet me compute it as:\n\n5040 \u00d7234 = 5040\u00d7(200+34) = 5040\u00d7200=1,008,000, plus 5040\u00d734.\n\nCompute 5040 \u00d730=151,200; 5040 \u00d74=20,160. So 151,200+20,160=171,360.\n\nTotal 1,008,000 +171,360=1,179,360.\n\nSo 5040 \u00d7234=1,179,360. The target is 1,180,800, which is 1,440 more. 1,440 divided by 5040 is 0.2857, so 234.2857.\n\nSo the minimum price is approximately $234.29.\n\nLooking at the options, the next higher is 240 (option C). So that must be the answer.\n\nSo the correct answer is C)240.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the minimum selling price per component that guarantees a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we start by calculating the total production cost and revenue required.\n\n### Key Calculations:\n1. **Total Units Produced Annually**:  \n   The company produces 420 units per month, so annually:  \n   \\[\n   420 \\times 12 = 5040 \\, \\text{units}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Total Production Cost Annually**:  \n   The production cost per unit is $110, so the total cost is:  \n   \\[\n   5040 \\times 110 = 554,400 \\, \\text{dollars}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Revenue Required for Desired Profit**:  \n   The desired annual profit is $626,400.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a company producing computer components. Hmm, let me try to understand what's being asked. The company makes 420 units every month, and each unit costs them $110 to produce. They sell all of them each month. We need to find the minimum selling price per component so that their yearly profit is at least $626,400.\n\nWait, profit is revenue minus costs, right? So I guess I need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total production cost to get the profit. And this profit has to be at least $626,400 annually.\n\nLet me break it down step by step. First, find out how much they produce in a year. They make 420 units a month, so that's 12 times 420. Let me compute that. 420 * 12. Hmm, 400*12 is 4800, and 20*12 is 240, so total is 5040 units per year.\n\nNow, the cost per unit is $110. So the total production cost for the year would be 5040 units multiplied by $110 each. Let me calculate that. 5040 * 110. Wait, 5040 * 100 is 504,000, and 5040 *10 is 50,400. So adding those together gives 554,400. So total cost is $554,400 per year.\n\nThe desired profit is $626,400. So the total revenue needed would be total cost plus desired profit. So 554,400 + 626,400. Let's add those. 554k plus 626k is 1,180,800. So total revenue needs to be at least $1,180,800 per year.\n\nRevenue is the number of units sold multiplied by the selling price per unit. So revenue = 5040 * price. We need this to be >= 1,180,800.\n\nSo, solving for price: price >= 1,180,800 / 5040. Let me compute that division. Hmm, 5040 into 1,180,800. Let me see, 5040 times 200 is 1,008,000. Subtract that from 1,180,800, which leaves 172,800. Now, 5040 *34 is 5040*30=151200, 5040*4=20160. So 151200+20160=171360. Adding that to 200 gives 234, but wait, 171360 is less than 172800. Hmm, let me see, 5040 *34 = 171,360. So 172,800 - 171,360 = 1,440 left. 5040 goes into 1,440 how many times? 1440 /5040 is 0.2857 times, so about 0.2857. So the total would be 200 + 34 + 0.2857 \u2248 234.2857.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the division. Maybe I should compute 1,180,800 \u00f7 5040. Another approach: 1,180,800 \u00f7 5040. Let's see, 5040 is 5.04 * 10^3. 1,180,800 is 1.1808 *10^6. So 1.1808e6 / 5.04e3 = (1.1808 /5.04) * 10^(6-3) )= (0.2342857) * 10^3 = 234.2857. So approximately $234.29 per unit.\n\nBut wait, the options given are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280. Hmm, 234.29 isn't among the options. So I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through the calculations again.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I messed up the total cost. Let me recheck that. The company produces 420 units per month. So yearly production is 420 *12=5040, that's correct. The cost per component is $110, so 5040 *110. Let me compute that again. 5040 *100 is 504,000. 5040 *10 is 50,400. So 504,000 + 50,400= 554,400. That's correct.\n\nDesired profit is 626,400. So total revenue needed is 554,400 +626,400= 1,180,800. Correct.\n\nSo revenue per unit is 1,180,800 /5040 = let me compute that again. 1,180,800 \u00f7 5040. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 100 to make it easier: 11,808 \u00f7 50.4. Hmm, 50.4 times 234 is 50.4*200=10,080; 50.4*34=1,713.6. So 10,080 +1,713.6= 11,793.6. Hmm, that's close to 11,808. The difference is 11,808 -11,793.6= 14.4. So 14.4 /50.4 = 0.2857. So total is 234.2857, as before. So around $234.29 per unit.\n\nBut none of the options is close to that. So I must have made a mistake in my approach. Wait, maybe the question is about the minimum price per unit that gives the profit each month, and then over a year it sums up? No, the problem says \"yearly profit\", so I think the correct approach is to calculate the annual profit.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the monthly profit and then multiply by 12. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo each month, the company produces 420 units. Let's say the selling price is P per unit. Their revenue each month is 420*P. Their cost each month is 420*110=46,200. So monthly profit is (420P - 46,200). Then, the yearly profit would be 12*(420P -46,200).\n\nWe want this to be at least 626,400. So:\n\n12*(420P -46,200) >= 626,400.\n\nDivide both sides by 12: 420P -46,200 >= 52,200.\n\nThen, 420P >= 52,200 +46,200 =98,400.\n\nSo P >= 98,400 /420. Let me compute that: 98,400 \u00f7420.\n\nWell, 420 *234 = let me compute 420*200=84,000; 420*34=14,280. So 84,000+14,280=98,280. Then, 98,400-98,280=120. So 120/420 is 0.2857. So P >= 234.2857. Again, same result as before.\n\nBut the options are 226, 230, 240, etc. Hmm. So maybe I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says \"yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400.\"\n\nWait, is the production cost per unit $110, so total cost is 5040*110=554,400 per year. So the profit is (total revenue) - (total cost) >=626,400.\n\nTotal revenue is 5040*P. So:\n\n5040 P - 554,400 >=626,400.\n\nSo 5040 P >= 626,400 +554,400 = 1,180,800.\n\nThus, P >= 1,180,800 /5040 =234.2857.\n\nSo the minimum price per unit is approximately $234.29.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So perhaps the options are incorrect, but more likely I made a mistake in my calculations. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the minimum selling price that would give a profit of at least $626,400 per month? Wait, but the question says \"yearly profit\".\n\nWait, wait, perhaps the profit is per month. No, the question says \"yearly profit\".\n\nWait, perhaps I should recalculate 1,180,800 \u00f75040.\n\nLet me do that division more accurately.\n\n1,180,800 divided by 5040.\n\n5040 \u00d7 234 = 5040 \u00d7 (200 +34) = 5040\u00d7200=1,008,000; 5040\u00d734.\n\nCompute 5040 \u00d730=151,200; 5040\u00d74=20,160.

So 5040\u00d7234=1,008,000 +171,360=1,179,360.\n\nSo 1,179,360 is 5040\u00d7234.\n\nNow, 1,180,800 -1,179,360=1,440.\n\nSo 1,440 /5040 = 0.2857. So P=234.2857.\n\nHmm, that's about $234.29.\n\nBut looking at the options, the closest one is B)230, which is lower, and C)240, which is higher. Since the required price is about $234.29, which is between 230 and 240. But wait, the options don't have 234. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the company sells all components each month, so perhaps the profit is calculated per month, and then multiplied by 12 to get the annual profit.\n\nWait, let me try the approach again.

Their cost per month is 420 \u00d7110=46,200.\n\nSo the required profit per month is 52,200.\n\nSo, monthly profit = (420 \u00d7 P) -46,200 >=52,200.\n\nSo, 420 P >=52,200 +46,200 =98,400.\n\nSo, P >=98,400 /420.\n\nCompute that: 98,400 \u00f7420.\n\nLet me see, 420 \u00d7234=98,280 (as before). 98,400 -98,280=120. 120/420= 0.2857. So P>=234.2857.\n\nSame result as before. So again, the price per unit must be at least approximately $234.29.\n\nBut the options don't have that.

Let me compute that: 672,600 \u00f7420.\n\n420 \u00d71600=672,000. 672,600-672,000=600. 600/420=1.4286. So P=1601.4286. Which is way higher than any of the options, so that can't be right.\n\nSo the original approach is correct. The problem must be that the options are wrong, but more likely I've made a mistake somewhere else.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says the company produces 420 units every month and sells them all, but maybe the selling price is per component, and perhaps I should compute the revenue correctly.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe I should calculate the total revenue per month, subtract the monthly cost, then multiply by 12 to get the annual profit.\n\nWait, no, that's what I did earlier. So the calculation seems correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the question says the company's production cost is $110 per component, which includes all costs. So the total cost per year is 5040 \u00d7110=554,400.\n\nSo the required revenue is 554,400 +626,400=1,180,800.\n\nSo per unit, 1,180,800 /5040= 234.2857.\n\nHmm. So the minimum price is about $234.29.\n\nBut the options don't include this. The closest options are B)230 and C)240. Since 234.29 is between 230 and 240, but the question asks for the minimum price that guarantees the profit. So the price must be at least 234.29, so the next higher option is 240 (option C). But that would give a higher profit than needed, which would be acceptable.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check what happens if the price is 230. Let me compute the profit.\n\nAt 230 per unit, revenue per year is 5040 \u00d7230= let's see, 5040 \u00d7200=1,008,000; 5040 \u00d730=151,200. Total=1,159,200.\n\nTotal cost is 554,400. Profit would be 1,159,200 -554,400=604,800.\n\nWhich is less than the desired 626,400. So 230 is insufficient.\n\nIf the price is 240, revenue is 5040 \u00d7240. 5040 \u00d7200=1,008,000; 5040 \u00d740=201,600. Total=1,209,600.\n\nProfit: 1,209,600 -554,400=655,200, which is above 626,400. So the minimum price is 234.29, but since the options don't have that, the next higher is 240, which would work. So option C is the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, why isn't 230 correct? Because at 230, the profit is lower than required. So the minimum price must be higher than 234.29, so the next option is 240.\n\nBut looking at the options again, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the problem says the company's production cost is $110 per component. So that's correct. So the total cost is 420 *12 *110 =5040 *110=554,400.\n\nSo, 5040 *P -554,400 >=626,400 \u2192 5040 P >=1,180,800 \u2192 P >=234.2857.\n\nSo the minimum price is approximately $234.29. But since the options don't have this, perhaps the correct answer is not present. But the options given are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the total number of units produced annually. Let me check that again. 420 units per month \u00d712 months=5040 units. Correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check the division 1,180,800 \u00f75040.\n\nLet me compute it as:\n\n5040 \u00d7234 = 5040\u00d7(200+34) = 5040\u00d7200=1,008,000, plus 5040\u00d734.\n\nCompute 5040 \u00d730=151,200; 5040 \u00d74=20,160. So 151,200+20,160=171,360.\n\nTotal 1,008,000 +171,360=1,179,360.\n\nSo 5040 \u00d7234=1,179,360. The target is 1,180,800, which is 1,440 more. 1,440 divided by 5040 is 0.2857, so 234.2857.\n\nSo the minimum price is approximately $234.29.\n\nLooking at the options, the next higher is 240 (option C). So that must be the answer.\n\nSo the correct answer is C)240.\n\n\nTo determine the minimum selling price per component that guarantees a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we start by calculating the total production cost and revenue required.\n\n### Key Calculations:\n1. **Total Units Produced Annually**:  \n   The company produces 420 units per month, so annually:  \n   \\[\n   420 \\times 12 = 5040 \\, \\text{units}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Total Production Cost Annually**:  \n   The production cost per unit is $110, so the total cost is:  \n   \\[\n   5040 \\times 110 = 554,400 \\, \\text{dollars}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Revenue Required for Desired Profit**:  \n   The desired annual profit is $626,400. Therefore, the total revenue needed is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Revenue} = \\text{Total Cost} + \\text{Desired Profit} = 554,400 + 626,400 = 1,180,800 \\, \\text{dollars}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Minimum Selling Price per Unit**:  \n   The total revenue is calculated as:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Revenue} = \\text{Selling Price per Unit} \\times \\text{Total Units}.\n   \\]  \n   Rearranging for the selling price:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Selling Price per Unit} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Total Units}} = \\frac{1,180,800}{5040}.\n   \\]  \n   Performing the division:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{1,180,800}{5040} \\approx 234.29 \\, \\text{dollars per unit}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verification Against Options**:  \n   The calculated minimum selling price of approximately $234.29 does not match any of the given options. However, the closest higher option is **$240**. Testing this price:  \n   - Total revenue at $240 per unit:  \n     \\[\n     5040 \\times 240 = 1,209,600 \\, \\text{dollars}.\n     \\]  \n   - Annual profit:  \n     \\[\n     1,209,600 - 554,400 = 655,200 \\, \\text{dollars}.\n     \\]  \n     This profit exceeds the required $626,400, confirming that $240 is sufficient.\n\n6. **Testing Lower Option ($230)**:  \n   At $230 per unit:  \n   - Total revenue:  \n     \\[\n     5040 \\times 230 = 1,159,200 \\, \\text{dollars}.\n     \\]  \n   - Annual profit:  \n     \\[\n     1,159,200 - 554,400 = 604,800 \\, \\text{dollars}.\n     \\]  \n     This profit is less than $626,400, so $230 is insufficient.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe minimum selling price per component that guarantees the desired annual profit is **$240**, as it is the smallest option that meets the requirement.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a company producing computer components. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm. The company produces 420 units every month. Each unit costs them $110 to produce. They sell all of them each month. The question is about finding the minimum selling price per component so that their yearly profit is at least $626,400.\n\nWait, so profit is revenue minus costs. Right. So I need to calculate the revenue and subtract the costs, and make sure that the profit is at least the target amount. And since it's yearly, I should probably consider the totals over 12 months.\n\nLet me break it down. First, calculate the monthly production cost. They make 420 units each month, each costing $110. So the monthly cost is 420 multiplied by 110. Let me do that math: 420 * 110. Hmm, 400*110 is 44,000, and 20*110 is 2,200. So total is 46,200 per month. So yearly cost would be 46,200 * 12. Let me calculate that: 46,200 * 10 is 462,000, and 46,200 *2 is 92,400. Adding those together gives 554,400. So the total production cost per year is $554,400.\n\nWait, but wait, the problem says the yearly profit needs to be at least $626,400. So profit is revenue minus costs. So, revenue needs to be at least 626,400 + 554,400. Let's add those: 626,400 plus 554,400. 626,400 + 500,000 is 1,126,400, then add 54,400, which makes 1,180,800. So the total revenue must be at least $1,180,800 per year.\n\nNow, revenue is the selling price per unit multiplied by the number of units sold. Since they sell all 420 units each month, the yearly revenue is 420 * 12 * price per unit. Wait, 420 per month times 12 months is 420*12 = 5040 units per year. So revenue is 5040 * price per component.\n\nSo, 5040 * price >= 1,180,800. To find the minimum price, I can rearrange that: price >= 1,180,800 / 5040.\n\nLet me compute that division. Hmm, 5040 into 1,180,800. Let me see, 5040 * 200 is 1,008,000. Subtracting that from 1,180,800 leaves 172,800. Now, 5040 * 34 is 5040*30=151,200 and 5040*4=20,160. So 151,200 +20,160=171,360. So 34 would give 171,360. Adding that to 200 gives 234, which is 200+34=234. But wait, 200*5040=1,008,000, 34*5040=171,360. 1,008,000 +171,360 = 1,179,360. But our target is 1,180,800. So 1,180,800 - 1,179,360 is 1,440. So how much more is that?\n\nEach 1 unit increase in price would add 5040 to the revenue. So 1,440 /5040 is 0.2857... So approximately 0.2857 dollars. So the price would be 234.2857. So the minimum price per unit is just over 234.2857 dollars.\n\nLooking at the options, the choices are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280. Wait, 234.2857 is about $234.29. So the next higher option is B)230, but that's lower than 234. So that wouldn't be enough. Next is C)240, which is higher than 234.29, so that would work.\n\nWait, wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, 5040 * 234 = let's compute 5040 *200=1,008,000, 5040*30=151,200, 5040*4=20,160. So 200+30+4=234. So 1,008,000 +151,200 = 1,159,200. 1,159,200 +20,160 = 1,179,360. So 234 gives 1,179,360 which is less than 1,180,800. So 234 is not enough. So the next possible option is 240.\n\nWait, 5040 *240 = let's compute 5040 *200=1,008,000, 5040*40=201,600. Adding those: 1,008,000 +201,600=1,209,600. Which is more than 1,180,800. So 240 is enough.\n\nWait, but wait another approach. Maybe I should compute 1,180,800 divided by 5040. Let me do that division.\n\n1,180,800 \u00f7 5040. Hmm, perhaps I can simplify the numbers.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: 118,080 \u00f7 504.\n\nLet me see if 504 goes into 118,080.\n\nCalculate 504 \u00d7 234: 504 \u00d7 200 = 100,800; 504 \u00d730=15,120; 504 \u00d74=2,016. Adding those: 100,800 +15,120 = 115,920; +2,016 = 117,936.\n\nSo 504 \u00d7234 =117,936. Subtract that from 118,080: 118,080 -117,936 =144.\n\nSo 144 is left. 504 goes into 144 0.2857 times. So total is 234 + 0.2857 = 234.2857. So as before, about $234.29 per unit.\n\nBut since the options don't have that, the next higher option is 240. So the minimum selling price per component is $240, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280. So 240 is the first option above 234.2857, so it's the minimum to meet the required profit.\n\nSo the answer should be C)240.\n",

The total revenue is then:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Revenue} = 5040 \\times p.\n   \\]  \n   To meet the required revenue:  \n   \\[\n   5040 \\times p \\geq 1,180,800.\n   \\]  \n   Solving for \\( p \\):  \n   \\[\n   p \\geq \\frac{1,180,800}{5040} \\approx 234.29 \\, \\text{dollars}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the Minimum Selling Price**:  \n   The calculated minimum selling price is approximately $234.29. However, the options provided are:  \n   A) $226, B) $230, C) $240, D) $260, E) $280.  \n   Since $234.29 is not an option, the next higher price that satisfies the requirement is $240.\n\nThus, the minimum selling price per component to guarantee the required yearly profit is **$240**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a company that produces computer components. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe company produces 420 units every month. The production cost is $110 per component. They sell all of them by the end of each month. The question is asking for the minimum selling price per component to guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400. The options are A to E, with different prices.\n\nHmm, right. So first, I need to figure out the total costs and revenue. Profit is revenue minus costs, and they want the profit to be at least $626,400 annually. So, I should probably calculate the total production costs first and then figure out the required revenue, then find the price per unit.\n\nLet me break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, the company produces 420 units each month. So, over a year, that's 12 months. Let me calculate the total number of units produced in a year. 420 multiplied by 12. Hmm, 420 * 12. Let me compute that. 420 *10 is 4200, and 420*2 is 840, so 4200+840=5040 units per year.\n\nEach unit costs $110 to produce. So the total production cost is 5040 * 110. Let me compute that. 5040 * 100 is 504,000. 5040 *10 is 50,400. So 504,000 +50,400=554,400. So total cost is $554,400 per year.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait a second. Because the cost is per component, so 420 per month. So each month, production cost is 420 *110. Let me compute that. 420 *100 is 42,000; 420 *10 is 4,200. So 42,000 +4,200 = 46,200 per month. Then over 12 months, 46,200 *12. Let me calculate that. 46,200 *10 is 462,000. 46,200 *2 is 92,400. So 462,000 +92,400 =554,400. Same as before. So the total cost is $554,400 per year.\n\nThey want the profit to be at least $626,400. So profit = revenue - cost. So revenue needs to be profit + cost. So $626,400 + $554,400 = $1,180,800.\n\nRevenue is the number of units sold multiplied by the selling price per unit. Since they sell all components each month, the annual revenue would be (price per unit) * total units per year. So revenue = price * 5040.\n\nWe need revenue to be at least $1,180,800. So:\n\nprice * 5040 >= 1,180,800.\n\nTo find the minimum price, we can divide both sides by 5040.\n\nprice >= 1,180,800 / 5040.\n\nLet me compute that. Let's see. 5040 is 5040. Let me see what 1,180,800 divided by 5040 is.\n\nHmm, let me see. Maybe simplify the numbers. 1,180,800 \u00f7 5040.\n\nI can do this step by step. Let's see, 5040 goes into 1,180,800 how many times?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor numerator and denominator to simplify.\n\nLet me factor 5040 first. 5040 is 504 *10, which is 56 *9 *10. Or 56 is 7*8, so 7*8*9*10. So 7*8*9*10=5040.\n\nThe numerator is 1,180,800. Let me see if I can divide both by 1000 first. 1,180,800 \u00f71000 is 1180.8. 5040 \u00f71000 is 5.04.\n\nWait, maybe better to see how many times 5040 fits into 1,180,800.\n\nLet me compute 5040 * 200 = 1,008,000. Because 5040 * 200 = 5040 *2 *100= 10,080 *100=1,008,000.\n\nSo 5040 * 200 = 1,008,000.\n\nThen, 1,180,800 -1,008,000 =172,800. So how many times does 5040 go into 172,800?\n\nLet me compute 5040 *30 = 151,200.\n\n172,800 -151,200=21,600.\n\n5040 *4=20,160.\n\n21,600-20,160=1,440.\n\n5040 *0.2857\u2248 1440? Because 5040/1440=3.5, so 5040 *0.2857=5040*(2/7)= approximately 1440.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let me compute 172,800 \u00f75040.\n\nDividing both by 10: 17,280 \u00f7504.\n\nHmm, 504 *34 = let's see. 504*30=15,120. 504*4=2,016. So 15,120+2,016=17,136.\n\n17,280 -17,136=144. So 34 times with a remainder of 144.\n\n144 \u00f7504 is 144/504= 12/42= 2/7\u22480.2857.\n\nSo 34.2857.\n\nSo total is 200 +34.2857=234.2857.\n\nSo 5040 * 234.2857=1,180,800.\n\nWait, but that's the price per unit. So the minimum price is approximately $234.29.\n\nBut the options are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nWait, so 234.29 is the minimum. So looking at the options, the smallest option higher than 234.29 is B)230, but wait wait, wait no, 230 is less than 234.29. So that's not enough. The next is 240.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me double-check my calculation because 234.29 is not one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-calculate 1,180,800 /5040.\n\nAnother approach: Let me compute 1,180,800 \u00f75040.\n\nFirst, let's divide numerator and denominator by 10: 118,080 \u00f7504.\n\nAgain, divide numerator and denominator by 8: 118,080 \u00f78=14,760; 504 \u00f78=63.\n\nSo 14,760 \u00f763.\n\nLet me compute 63 * 200=12,600. 14,760-12,600=2,160.\n\n63*34=2,142. 2,160-2,142=18.\n\nSo 200+34=234, and 18/63= 2/7\u22480.2857.\n\nSo 234.2857.\n\nHmm, same as before. So 234.29 per unit is needed.\n\nLooking at the options, the choices are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nWait, so 234.29 is needed. So the next higher option is 240, which is option C.\n\nSo the minimum price is 240.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because the question says \"minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit will be at least $626,400\".\n\nSo the price must be at least 234.29, but since the price must be a whole dollar amount (I think the options are integers), so the minimum price is $235, but the options don't have that. So the next available option is 240.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the initial problem. Did I make a mistake in the total cost or revenue?\n\nWait, the company's production cost is $110 per component. So each month, 420 units cost 420 *110=46,200. So per month, the cost is 46,200. So over 12 months, 46,200 *12 =554,400. Correct.\n\nProfit is revenue minus cost. So desired profit is 626,400.\n\nSo revenue must be at least 626,400 +554,400=1,180,800.\n\nTotal units per year are 420 *12=5040.\n\nSo revenue per unit is 1,180,800 /5040.\n\nWhich is 234.2857.\n\nSo price must be at least 234.2857, so $235 per unit would be needed. But since the options don't have that, the next higher option is 240.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me see if 234.29 is the exact value. So 234.2857 is approximately 234.29, but when dealing with money, you can't have a fraction of a cent, but since the options are in whole dollars, perhaps the price must be at least 235, but since 235 isn't an option, the next is 240.\n\nWait, but let me check what happens if the price is 230. Let's compute the profit.\n\nIf the price is 230 per unit, then total revenue is 5040 *230= 5040 *200=1,008,000; 5040 *30=151,200. So 1,008,000+151,200=1,159,200.\n\nSubtract the cost 554,400: 1,159,200 -554,400 = 604,800. Which is less than 626,400. So 230 is too low.\n\nWhat about 240? 5040 *240= let's compute that.\n\n5040 *200=1,008,000.\n\n5040 *40=201,600.\n\nSo total is 1,209,600.\n\nMinus cost 554,400: 1,209,600 -554,400=655,200. Which is more than 626,400. So 240 gives a profit of 655,200, which meets the requirement.\n\nSo the minimum price is 234.29, but since the options don't have that, the next available is 240, which is option C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the required revenue. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I should have calculated per month and then multiplied by 12. Let me try that approach.\n\nEach month, the company sells 420 units. The cost per month is 420 *110=46,200. Let me denote the selling price per unit as P. So monthly revenue is 420 * P.\n\nProfit per month is revenue minus cost: 420P -46,200.\n\nYearly profit is 12*(420P -46,200) >=626,400.\n\nSo 12*(420P -46,200) >=626,400.\n\nDivide both sides by 12: 420P -46,200 >=52,200.\n\nAdding 46,200 to both sides: 420P >=52,200 +46,200=98,400.\n\nSo 420P >=98,400.\n\nP >=98,400 /420.\n\nCompute that: 98,400 \u00f7420.\n\nLet me see, 420 * 234 = let's see, 420*200=84,000. 420*34=14,280. So 84,000 +14,280=98,280. That's 234 units.\n\nWait, wait, that's the number of units. Wait, no, wait. No, the equation is P >=98,400 /420.\n\nWait, 98,400 divided by 420. Let me compute that.\n\nWell, 420 * 234 = 98,280. So 234 gives 98,280. 98,400 -98,280=120. So 120/420 = 0.2857.\n\nSo P >=234.2857.\n\nSame as before. So P must be at least approximately 234.29.\n\nAgain, the options don't have 234.29, so the next higher option is 240, which is option C.\n\nWait, but why is option B 230? Let me check again. Let's compute the profit if P=230.\n\nProfit per month: 420*230=96,600 revenue. Minus 46,200 cost: 96,600 -46,200=50,400 per month.\n\nYearly profit: 50,400 *12=604,800. Which is less than 626,400. So 230 isn't enough.\n\nWhat about 234? Let's see: 420 *234 = let's compute that. 420 *200=84,000; 420 *34=14,280. Total 98,280.\n\nMinus 46,200: 98,280 -46,200=52,080 per month.\n\nYearly: 52,080 *12=624,960. Hmm, which is still less than 626,400.\n\nSo 234 gives 624,960, which is 1,440 less than needed.\n\nSo 234.29 would be needed, but since we can't have a fraction of a cent, the next integer is 235. Let's compute the profit at 235.\n\n420 *235 = let's compute that. 420 *200=84,000; 420*35=14,700. So 84,000+14,700=98,700.\n\nMinus 46,200: 52,500 per month.\n\nYearly: 52,500 *12=630,000. Which is more than 626,400.\n\nSo 235 gives a profit of 630,000, which meets the requirement.\n\nBut since the options don't include 235, the next higher is 240. So option C is 240.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial profit calculation. Let me recheck the initial profit equation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I'm calculating the revenue correctly. Let me think again.\n\nProfit per year is revenue - cost.\n\nRevenue = price per unit * number of units sold.\n\nCost is fixed at 554,400.\n\nSo, revenue must be >=554,400 +626,400=1,180,800.\n\nSo price per unit =1,180,800 /5040=234.2857.\n\nSo the minimum price is 234.2857. Since the options don't have this, we need to pick the next higher price that's available, which is 240.\n\nSo the correct answer is C)240.\n",

So 34 times with a remainder of 144.\n\n144 \u00f7504 is 144/504= 12/42= 2/7\u22480.2857.\n\nSo 34.2857.\n\nSo total is 200 +34.2857=234.2857.\n\nSo 5040 * 234.2857=1,180,800.\n\nWait, but that's the price per unit. So the minimum price is approximately $234.29.\n\nBut the options are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nWait, so 234.29 is the minimum. So looking at the options, the smallest option higher than 234.29 is B)230, but wait wait, wait no, 230 is less than 234.29. So that's not enough. The next is 240.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me double-check my calculation because 234.29 is not one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-calculate 1,180,800 /5040.\n\nAnother approach: Let me compute 1,180,800 \u00f75040.\n\nFirst, let's divide numerator and denominator by 10: 118,080 \u00f7504.\n\nAgain, divide numerator and denominator by 8: 118,080 \u00f78=14,760; 504 \u00f78=63.\n\nSo 14,760 \u00f763.\n\nLet me compute 63 * 200=12,600. 14,760-12,600=2,160.\n\n63*34=2,142. 2,160-2,142=18.\n\nSo 200+34=234, and 18/63= 2/7\u22480.2857.\n\nSo 234.2857.\n\nHmm, same as before. So 234.29 per unit is needed.\n\nLooking at the options, the choices are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nWait, so 234.29 is needed. So the next higher option is 240, which is option C.\n\nSo the minimum price is 240.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because the question says \"minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit will be at least $626,400\".\n\nSo the price must be at least 234.29, but since the price must be a whole dollar amount (I think the options are integers), so the minimum price is $235, but the options don't have that. So the next available option is 240.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the initial problem. Did I make a mistake in the total cost or revenue?\n\nWait, the company's production cost is $110 per component. So each month, 420 units cost 420 *110=46,200. So per month, the cost is 46,200. So over 12 months, 46,200 *12 =554,400. Correct.\n\nProfit is revenue minus cost. So desired profit is 626,400.\n\nSo revenue must be at least 626,400 +554,400=1,180,800.\n\nTotal units per year are 420 *12=5040.\n\nSo revenue per unit is 1,180,800 /5040.\n\nWhich is 234.2857.\n\nSo price must be at least 234.2857, so $235 per unit would be needed. But since the options don't have that, the next higher option is 240.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me see if 234.29 is the exact value. So 234.2857 is approximately 234.29, but when dealing with money, you can't have a fraction of a cent, but since the options are in whole dollars, perhaps the price must be at least 235, but since 235 isn't an option, the next is 240.\n\nWait, but let me check what happens if the price is 230. Let's compute the profit.\n\nIf the price is 230 per unit, then total revenue is 5040 *230= 5040 *200=1,008,000; 5040 *30=151,200. So 1,008,000+151,200=1,159,200.\n\nSubtract the cost 554,400: 1,159,200 -554,400 = 604,800. Which is less than 626,400. So 230 is too low.\n\nWhat about 240? 5040 *240= let's compute that.\n\n5040 *200=1,008,000.\n\n5040 *40=201,600.\n\nSo total is 1,209,600.\n\nMinus cost 554,400: 1,209,600 -554,400=655,200. Which is more than 626,400. So 240 gives a profit of 655,200, which meets the requirement.\n\nSo the minimum price is 234.29, but since the options don't have that, the next available is 240, which is option C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the required revenue. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I should have calculated per month and then multiplied by 12. Let me try that approach.\n\nEach month, the company sells 420 units. The cost per month is 420 *110=46,200. Let me denote the selling price per unit as P. So monthly revenue is 420 * P.\n\nProfit per month is revenue minus cost: 420P -46,200.\n\nYearly profit is 12*(420P -46,200) >=626,400.\n\nSo 12*(420P -46,200) >=626,400.\n\nDivide both sides by 12: 420P -46,200 >=52,200.\n\nAdding 46,200 to both sides: 420P >=52,200 +46,200=98,400.\n\nSo 420P >=98,400.\n\nP >=98,400 /420.\n\nCompute that: 98,400 \u00f7420.\n\nLet me see, 420 * 234 = let's see, 420*200=84,000. 420*34=14,280. So 84,000 +14,280=98,280. That's 234 units.\n\nWait, wait, that's the number of units. Wait, no, wait. No, the equation is P >=98,400 /420.\n\nWait, 98,400 divided by 420. Let me compute that.\n\nWell, 420 * 234 = 98,280. So 234 gives 98,280. 98,400 -98,280=120. So 120/420 = 0.2857.\n\nSo P >=234.2857.\n\nSame as before. So P must be at least approximately 234.29.\n\nAgain, the options don't have 234.29, so the next higher option is 240, which is option C.\n\nWait, but why is option B 230? Let me check again. Let's compute the profit if P=230.\n\nProfit per month: 420*230=96,600 revenue. Minus 46,200 cost: 96,600 -46,200=50,400 per month.\n\nYearly profit: 50,400 *12=604,800. Which is less than 626,400. So 230 isn't enough.\n\nWhat about 234? Let's see: 420 *234 = let's compute that. 420 *200=84,000; 420 *34=14,280. Total 98,280.\n\nMinus 46,200: 98,280 -46,200=52,080 per month.\n\nYearly: 52,080 *12=624,960. Hmm, which is still less than 626,400.\n\nSo 234 gives 624,960, which is 1,440 less than needed.\n\nSo 234.29 would be needed, but since we can't have a fraction of a cent, the next integer is 235. Let's compute the profit at 235.\n\n420 *235 = let's compute that. 420 *200=84,000; 420*35=14,700. So 84,000+14,700=98,700.\n\nMinus 46,200: 52,500 per month.\n\nYearly: 52,500 *12=630,000. Which is more than 626,400.\n\nSo 235 gives a profit of 630,000, which meets the requirement.\n\nBut since the options don't include 235, the next higher is 240. So option C is 240.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial profit calculation. Let me recheck the initial profit equation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I'm calculating the revenue correctly. Let me think again.\n\nProfit per year is revenue - cost.\n\nRevenue = price per unit * number of units sold.\n\nCost is fixed at 554,400.\n\nSo, revenue must be >=554,400 +626,400=1,180,800.\n\nSo price per unit =1,180,800 /5040=234.2857.\n\nSo the minimum price is 234.2857. Since the options don't have this, we need to pick the next higher price that's available, which is 240.\n\nSo the correct answer is C)240.\n\n\nTo determine the minimum selling price per component that guarantees a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we start by calculating the total production cost and revenue required.\n\n### Step 1: Total Production Cost\nThe company produces 420 units per month at a cost of $110 per unit. Over a year:\n\\[\n\\text{Total production cost} = 420 \\, \\text{units/month} \\times 12 \\, \\text{months} \\times \\$110/\\text{unit} = \\$554,400\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Total Revenue Required\nThe desired yearly profit is $626,400. Profit is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\text{Profit} = \\text{Revenue} - \\text{Cost}\n\\]\nRearranging for revenue:\n\\[\n\\text{Revenue} = \\text{Profit} + \\text{Cost} = \\$626,400 + \\$554,400 = \\$1,180,800\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Minimum Selling Price per Unit\nThe company produces 420 units per month, so the total number of units produced in a year is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total units/year} = 420 \\, \\text{units/month} \\times 12 \\, \\text{months} = 5040 \\, \\text{units/year}\n\\]\nThe revenue is related to the selling price per unit (\\(P\\)) by:\n\\[\n\\text{Revenue} = P \\times \\text{Total units/year}\n\\]\nSubstituting the required revenue:\n\\[\nP \\times 5040 \\geq 1,180,800\n\\]\nSolving for \\(P\\):\n\\[\nP \\geq \\frac{1,180,800}{5040} \\approx 234.29\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Selecting the Minimum Selling Price\nThe calculated minimum selling price is approximately \\$234.29. However, the options provided are integers, and the price must be a whole number. Among the options:\n- **A) \\$226**: Too low, as it would result in insufficient profit.\n- **B) \\$230**: Too low, as it would result in insufficient profit.\n- **C) \\$240**: Sufficient, as it guarantees the required profit.\n- **D) \\$260**: Exceeds the minimum requirement.\n- **E) \\$280**: Exceeds the minimum requirement.\n\nThus, the minimum selling price that guarantees the required profit is **\\$240**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a company that produces computer components. Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nThe company makes 420 units every month. So, over a year, which I guess is 12 months, they make 420 multiplied by 12. Let me calculate that: 420 * 12. Hmm, 400*12 is 4800, and 20*12 is 240, so total is 5040 units a year. Got that.\n\nEach component costs them $110 to produce. So the total production cost per year would be 5040 units multiplied by $110. Let me compute that. 5040 * 110. Breaking it down, 5000*110 is 550,000, and 40*110 is 4,400. So total is 550,000 + 4,400 = 554,400. So their yearly production cost is $554,400.\n\nThe company sells all the components every month, and they want a yearly profit of at least $626,400. Profit is revenue minus production costs. So, Profit = Revenue - Cost.\n\nWe need to find the minimum selling price per component such that the profit is at least $626,400.\n\nLet me write the formula: Profit >= $626,400.\n\nRevenue is the number of units sold multiplied by the selling price per unit. Since they sell all they produce, revenue is 5040 * price per unit. Let's denote the price per unit as P.\n\nSo,\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\n626,400 <= (5040 * P) - 554,400\n\nI need to solve for P.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation:\n\n5040P >= 626,400 + 554,400\n\nAdding those numbers: 626,400 + 554,400. Let's see, 600,000 + 554,400 is 1,154,400, and then adding 26,400 makes 1,180,800. So,\n\n5040P >= 1,180,800\n\nNow, solve for P by dividing both sides by 5040.\n\nP >= 1,180,800 / 5040\n\nHmm, what's 1,180,800 divided by 5040. Let me compute that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can simplify the division. Let's see:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10 to get 118,080 / 504.\n\nWait, perhaps both numbers can be divided by 24? Let me check.\n\n5040 \u00f7 24 is 210. 118080 \u00f724 is 4920. So now it's 4920 / 210.\n\nHmm, 210 times 23 is 4830, because 200*210=42,000 no, wait 210*23 is 210*(20+3)=4200 +630=4830. 4920 minus 4830 is 90. So 23 and 90/210. Which simplifies to 23 + 3/7, which is approximately 23.42857.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because looking at the options, the prices are all in the 200s. Oh wait, I think I messed up the calculation somewhere.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me double-check. Because 5040 units per year, so 5040*P is revenue. But I think I messed up the calculation of 1,180,800 divided by 5040.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me compute 1,180,800 / 5040.\n\nLet me divide both numerator and denominator by 10: 118,080 / 504.\n\nHmm, 504 \u00d7 200 is 100,800. Subtracting that from 118,080 leaves 17,280.\n\nNow, 504 \u00d7 34 is 504\u00d730=15,120 plus 504\u00d74=2,016 \u2192 15,120 + 2,016 = 17,136. Hmm, that's close to 17,280.\n\nWait, 504 \u00d734 = 17,136. So 17,280 -17,136 is 144. Now, 144 /504 is 144/504 = 12/42 = 2/7, which is about 0.2857.\n\nSo total is 200 +34 + 2/7 = 234.2857.\n\nWait, that's about 234.29 per unit. But none of the options are that low. The options start at 226, 230, etc. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in adding 626,400 and 554,400. Let me check that again. 626,400 + 554,400.\n\n626,400 plus 554,400. Let's compute:\n\n626,400 + 500,000 is 1,126,400.\n\nThen add 54,400 \u2192 1,126,400 +54,400 = 1,180,800. That part was correct.\n\nSo 1,180,800 / 5040 is the correct calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute 5040 \u00d7 234. Let me see:\n\n5040 \u00d7 200 = 1,008,000.\n\n5040 \u00d734 = 5040*(30+4) = 151,200 + 20,160 = 171,360.\n\nSo 1,008,000 + 171,360 = 1,179,360.\n\nHmm, which is 1,179,360. But we need 1,180,800. So 1,180,800 -1,179,360 = 1,440.\n\nSo 5040 \u00d7 x = 1,180,800.\n\nx = (1,180,800) /5040 = ?\n\nWait, 5040 \u00d7 234 = 1,179,360.\n\nSo 1,180,800 -1,179,360 = 1,440. So 5040 * 0.2857 is 1,440, because 5040 \u00d7 0.2857 \u2248 5040*(2/7) \u2248 1440.\n\nSo 234 + (1440/5040) \u2192 1440/5040 is 0.2857, so 234.2857.\n\nSo P is at least approximately 234.29. But looking at the options, the choices are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nWait, but 234.29 is not among the options. So perhaps I made a miscalculation. Alternatively, maybe I should approach the problem differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the required profit per unit. Let me think again.\n\nThe required profit is $626,400 per year. The cost is $554,400. So the required revenue is 626,400 + 554,400 = 1,180,800.\n\nRevenue is 5040 units * price per unit. So price per unit is 1,180,800 / 5040.\n\nLet me compute 1,180,800 \u00f7 5040.\n\nHmm, 5040 \u00d7 230 = ?\n\n5040 \u00d7200=1,008,000.\n\n5040 \u00d730=151,200. So 1,008,000 +151,200=1,159,200.\n\nWait, 5040 \u00d7230 = 1,159,200. But we need 1,180,800. So 1,180,800 -1,159,200=21,600.\n\nSo 21,600 \u00f75040 = 4.2857.\n\nSo 230 +4.2857\u2248234.2857. So again, same result as before.\n\nWait, but the options don't have this value. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the annual production cost.\n\nWait, the company produces 420 units per month. So 420 \u00d712=5040 per year. That's correct.\n\nProduction cost is $110 per component, so 5040 \u00d7110 = 554,400. That's correct.\n\nSo required revenue is 554,400 + 626,400 = 1,180,800. Correct.\n\nSo 1,180,800 /5040 = 234.2857. So the minimum price per unit is $234.29.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest higher option is C)240. Because if they sell at 234.29, they just meet the target. But since the options don't have this, perhaps the correct answer is the next higher option, which is 240. So option C.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because the options may not have the exact value, but we need the minimum price that ensures the profit is at least 626,400. So if the price is 234.29, that's the minimum. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I should recompute 1,180,800 \u00f75040.\n\nLet me try that division again. 5040 goes into 1,180,800 how many times?\n\n5040 \u00d7 200 is 1,008,000.\n\nSubtract that from 1,180,800 \u2192 172,800 left.\n\n5040 \u00d7 34 is 5040 \u00d730=151,200; 5040\u00d74=20,160 \u2192 total 171,360.\n\nSubtracting 171,360 from 172,800 gives 1,440.\n\nNow, 5040 \u00d7 0.2857 \u22481440.\n\nSo total is 200 +34 +0.2857 = 234.2857.\n\nSo yeah, 234.2857.\n\nLooking at the options, the next higher is 230 and 240. Wait, 234 is higher than 230, so 230 would give a revenue of 5040 \u00d7230=1,159,200.\n\nThen profit would be 1,159,200 -554,400=604,800. But the required profit is 626,400, which is higher. So 230 is too low.\n\nSo the next option is 240. Let's compute the profit at 240.\n\n5040 \u00d7240 = 1,209,600.\n\nProfit is 1,209,600 -554,400 =655,200.\n\nWhich is higher than 626,400. So that works. So the minimum price is between 234.29 and 240. Since 234.29 isn't an option, the next possible is 240.\n\nWait, but the options have B)230 and C)240.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a company that produces computer components. Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nThe company makes 420 units every month. So, over a year, which I guess is 12 months, they make 420 multiplied by 12. Let me calculate that: 420 * 12. Hmm, 400*12 is 4800, and 20*12 is 240, so total is 5040 units a year. Got that.\n\nEach component costs them $110 to produce. So the total production cost per year would be 5040 units multiplied by $110. Let me compute that. 5040 * 110. Breaking it down, 5000*110 is 550,000, and 40*110 is 4,400. So total is 550,000 + 4,400 = 554,400. So their yearly production cost is $554,400.\n\nThe company sells all the components every month, and they want a yearly profit of at least $626,400. Profit is revenue minus production costs. So, Profit = Revenue - Cost.\n\nWe need to find the minimum selling price per component such that the profit is at least $626,400.\n\nLet me write the formula: Profit >= $626,400.\n\nRevenue is the number of units sold multiplied by the selling price per unit. Since they sell all they produce, revenue is 5040 * price per unit. Let's denote the price per unit as P.\n\nSo,\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\n626,400 <= (5040 * P) - 554,400\n\nI need to solve for P.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation:\n\n5040P >= 626,400 + 554,400\n\nAdding those numbers: 626,400 + 554,400. Let's see, 600,000 + 554,400 is 1,154,400, and then adding 26,400 makes 1,180,800. So,\n\n5040P >= 1,180,800\n\nNow, solve for P by dividing both sides by 5040.\n\nP >= 1,180,800 / 5040\n\nHmm, what's 1,180,800 divided by 5040. Let me compute that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can simplify the division. Let's see:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10 to get 118,080 / 504.\n\nWait, perhaps both numbers can be divided by 24? Let me check.\n\n5040 \u00f7 24 is 210. 118080 \u00f724 is 4920. So now it's 4920 / 210.\n\nHmm, 210 times 23 is 4830, because 200*210=42,000 no, wait 210*23 is 210*(20+3)=4200 +630=4830. 4920 minus 4830 is 90. So 23 and 90/210. Which simplifies to 23 + 3/7, which is approximately 23.42857.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because looking at the options, the prices are all in the 200s. Oh wait, I think I messed up the calculation somewhere.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me double-check. Because 5040 units per year, so 5040*P is revenue. But I think I messed up the calculation of 1,180,800 divided by 5040.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me compute 1,180,800 / 5040.\n\nLet me divide both numerator and denominator by 10: 118,080 / 504.\n\nHmm, 504 \u00d7 200 is 100,800. Subtracting that from 118,080 leaves 17,280.\n\nNow, 504 \u00d7 34 is 504\u00d730=15,120 plus 504\u00d74=2,016 \u2192 15,120 + 2,016 = 17,136. Hmm, that's close to 17,280.\n\nWait, 504 \u00d734 = 17,136. So 17,280 -17,136 is 144. Now, 144 /504 is 144/504 = 12/42 = 2/7, which is about 0.2857.\n\nSo total is 200 +34 + 2/7 = 234.2857.\n\nWait, that's about 234.29 per unit. But none of the options are that low. The options start at 226, 230, etc. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in adding 626,400 and 554,400. Let me check that again. 626,400 + 554,400.\n\n626,400 plus 554,400. Let's compute:\n\n626,400 + 500,000 is 1,126,400.\n\nThen add 54,400 \u2192 1,126,400 +54,400 = 1,180,800. That part was correct.\n\nSo 1,180,800 / 5040 is the correct calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute 5040 \u00d7 234. Let me see:\n\n5040 \u00d7 200 = 1,008,000.\n\n5040 \u00d734 = 5040*(30+4) = 151,200 + 20,160 = 171,360.\n\nSo 1,008,000 + 171,360 = 1,179,360.\n\nHmm, which is 1,179,360. But we need 1,180,800. So 1,180,800 -1,179,360 = 1,440.\n\nSo 5040 \u00d7 x = 1,180,800.\n\nx = (1,180,800) /5040 = ?\n\nWait, 5040 \u00d7 234 = 1,179,360.\n\nSo 1,180,800 -1,179,360 = 1,440. So 5040 * 0.2857 is 1,440, because 5040 \u00d7 0.2857 \u2248 5040*(2/7) \u2248 1440.\n\nSo 234 + (1440/5040) \u2192 1440/5040 is 0.2857, so 234.2857.\n\nSo P is at least approximately 234.29. But looking at the options, the choices are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nWait, but 234.29 is not among the options. So perhaps I made a miscalculation. Alternatively, maybe I should approach the problem differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the required profit per unit. Let me think again.\n\nThe required profit is $626,400 per year. The cost is $554,400. So the required revenue is 626,400 + 554,400 = 1,180,800.\n\nRevenue is 5040 units * price per unit. So price per unit is 1,180,800 / 5040.\n\nLet me compute 1,180,800 \u00f7 5040.\n\nHmm, 5040 \u00d7 230 = ?\n\n5040 \u00d7200=1,008,000.\n\n5040 \u00d730=151,200. So 1,008,000 +151,200=1,159,200.\n\nWait, 5040 \u00d7230 = 1,159,200. But we need 1,180,800. So 1,180,800 -1,159,200=21,600.\n\nSo 21,600 \u00f75040 = 4.2857.\n\nSo 230 +4.2857\u2248234.2857. So again, same result as before.\n\nWait, but the options don't have this value. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the annual production cost.\n\nWait, the company produces 420 units per month. So 420 \u00d712=5040 per year. That's correct.\n\nProduction cost is $110 per component, so 5040 \u00d7110 = 554,400. That's correct.\n\nSo required revenue is 554,400 + 626,400 = 1,180,800. Correct.\n\nSo 1,180,800 /5040 = 234.2857. So the minimum price per unit is $234.29.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest higher option is C)240. Because if they sell at 234.29, they just meet the target. But since the options don't have this, perhaps the correct answer is the next higher option, which is 240. So option C.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because the options may not have the exact value, but we need the minimum price that ensures the profit is at least 626,400. So if the price is 234.29, that's the minimum. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I should recompute 1,180,800 \u00f75040.\n\nLet me try that division again. 5040 goes into 1,180,800 how many times?\n\n5040 \u00d7 200 is 1,008,000.\n\nSubtract that from 1,180,800 \u2192 172,800 left.\n\n5040 \u00d7 34 is 5040 \u00d730=151,200; 5040\u00d74=20,160 \u2192 total 171,360.\n\nSubtracting 171,360 from 172,800 gives 1,440.\n\nNow, 5040 \u00d7 0.2857 \u22481440.\n\nSo total is 200 +34 +0.2857 = 234.2857.\n\nSo yeah, 234.2857.\n\nLooking at the options, the next higher is 230 and 240. Wait, 234 is higher than 230, so 230 would give a revenue of 5040 \u00d7230=1,159,200.\n\nThen profit would be 1,159,200 -554,400=604,800. But the required profit is 626,400, which is higher. So 230 is too low.\n\nSo the next option is 240. Let's compute the profit at 240.\n\n5040 \u00d7240 = 1,209,600.\n\nProfit is 1,209,600 -554,400 =655,200.\n\nWhich is higher than 626,400. So that works. So the minimum price is between 234.29 and 240. Since 234.29 isn't an option, the next possible is 240.\n\nWait, but the options have B)230 and C)240. So 230 is too low, 240 is sufficient.\n\nSo the correct answer must be C)240.\n\n\nTo determine the minimum selling price per component that guarantees a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we start by calculating the total production cost and revenue required.\n\n1. **Total Units Produced per Year**:  \n   The company produces 420 units per month, so over 12 months:  \n   \\[\n   420 \\times 12 = 5040 \\, \\text{units/year}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Total Production Cost per Year**:  \n   The production cost per unit is $110, so the total cost is:  \n   \\[\n   5040 \\times 110 = 554,400 \\, \\text{dollars/year}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Required Revenue for the Desired Profit**:  \n   The desired profit is $626,400.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the minimum selling price per component the company needs to set to make sure their yearly profit is at least $626,400. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the given information. The company produces 420 units every month. So, in a year, how many units are we talking about? Well, a year has 12 months, right? So 420 multiplied by 12. Let me calculate that: 420 * 12. 400*12 is 4800, and 20*12 is 240, so total is 5040 units per year. Got that down.\n\nThe production cost per component is $110. So the total production cost for the year would be the number of units produced multiplied by the cost per unit. So that's 5040 units * $110. Let me do the math: 5000*110 is 550,000, and 40*110 is 4,400. So total is 554,400. So their yearly production cost is $554,400.\n\nThey want a yearly profit of at least $626,400. Profit is calculated as revenue minus costs. So, profit = revenue - cost. Rearranging that, revenue must be equal to profit plus cost. So the revenue needed is 626,400 + 554,400. Let me add those numbers: 626,400 + 554,400. Hmm, 626k plus 554k is 1,180,800. So the total revenue has to be at least $1,180,800.\n\nRevenue is the selling price per unit multiplied by the number of units sold. Since they sell all components each month, their revenue is (price per unit) * 5040 units. Let me denote the price per unit as P. So, revenue = P * 5040.\n\nWe know that revenue needs to be at least $1,180,800. So, P * 5040 >= 1,180,800. To find the minimum P, we can divide both sides by 5040.\n\nSo, P >= 1,180,800 / 5040. Let me compute that. Hmm, 5040 goes into 1,180,800 how many times? Let me see. Let me simplify the division.\n\nFirst, let me see what 5040 is in terms of factors. 5040 is 504 * 10, which is 56 * 9 * 10. But maybe I can divide both numerator and denominator by 10 to make it easier. So, 1,180,800 \u00f7 10 is 118,080, and 5040 \u00f7 10 is 504. So now, 118,080 / 504.\n\nHmm, let's see if 504 goes into 118,080. Let me try dividing 118,080 by 504.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can simplify the numbers by dividing numerator and denominator by some common factors. Let's see:\n\n504 = 56 * 9 = 7*8 * 3^2.\n\n118,080. Let's see if 504 divides into it. Let me see: 504 * 200 is 100,800. Subtract that from 118,080: 118,080 - 100,800 = 17,280. Now, how much is 504 into 17,280?\n\nWait, 504 * 34 is 504*(30+4) = 15,120 + 2,016 = 17,136. Hmm, but 17,280 is more. So 34 gives 17,136. The difference is 17,280 -17,136=144.\n\nSo 504 * 34 =17,136, and then 504 * 0.2857 (since 144 is 504 * (144/504) )= 0.2857 approximately. So 34.2857.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute 118080 / 504.\n\nAlternatively, let me do it step by step. Let's compute 118080 \u00f7 504.\n\nDividing 118080 by 504:\n\n504 * 200 = 100,800.\n\nSubtract: 118,080 - 100,800 = 17,280.\n\nNow, 504 * 34 = 17,136 (because 504 *30=15,120, 504*4=2,016; 15,120+2,016=17,136).\n\nSubtract 17,136 from 17,280: 17,280 -17,136=144.\n\nSo, that's 200 +34 =234, and 144 left.\n\nNow, 504 goes into 144 how many times? 0.2857 times. So, 234 + 0.2857 \u2248234.2857.\n\nSo, approximately 234.2857 dollars.\n\nBut the options are all whole numbers. So, P must be at least 234.2857, so the next whole number is 235. But wait, looking at the options, the choices are 226, 230, 240, etc. Hmm, none of the options are 235. So did I make a mistake in my calculation?\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I made an error in the initial steps. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, let's go back. The company's monthly production is 420 units. So, annual production is 420 *12 =5040 units. Correct.\n\nCost per unit is $110, so total cost is 5040 * 110. Let me compute that again. 5040 * 100 is 504,000. 5040 *10 is 50,400. So 504,000 +50,400=554,400. Correct.\n\nDesired profit is $626,400. So, total revenue required is 554,400 +626,400 = 1,180,800. Correct.\n\nSo revenue is P * 5040 >=1,180,800.\n\nSo P >=1,180,800 /5040.\n\nLet me compute 1,180,800 /5040.\n\nWait, perhaps I can simplify the division by canceling zeros. 1,180,800 \u00f75040.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: 118,080 /504.\n\nAgain, 118,080 \u00f7504. Let me try another approach. Let's see how many times 504 goes into 118,080.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 1,180,800 \u00f75040 by simplifying the numbers. Let me see:\n\n1,180,800 \u00f75040 = (1,180,800 \u00f7 10) \u00f7 (5040 \u00f710) )= 118,080 \u00f7 504.\n\nHmm, 504 * 200 is 100,800. Subtract that from 118,080: 17,280.\n\n504 *34 = 17,136. So 17,280 -17,136 =144.\n\nSo 200 +34=234, and 144 left.\n\n504 goes into 144 zero times, but in decimal, 144 is 144/504 = 0.2857.\n\nSo, 234.2857.

So 504*234=117,936. Now, 118,080 -117,936=144. So 144/504=0.2857.\n\nSo P is 234.2857. So to get at least that, the price must be at least 234.29.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the minimum selling price per component the company needs to set to make sure their yearly profit is at least $626,400. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the given information. The company produces 420 units every month. So, in a year, how many units are we talking about? Well, a year has 12 months, right? So 420 multiplied by 12. Let me calculate that: 420 * 12. 400*12 is 4800, and 20*12 is 240, so total is 5040 units per year. Got that down.\n\nThe production cost per component is $110. So the total production cost for the year would be the number of units produced multiplied by the cost per unit. So that's 5040 units * $110. Let me do the math: 5000*110 is 550,000, and 40*110 is 4,400. So total is 554,400. So their yearly production cost is $554,400.\n\nThey want a yearly profit of at least $626,400. Profit is calculated as revenue minus costs. So, profit = revenue - cost. Rearranging that, revenue must be equal to profit plus cost. So the revenue needed is 626,400 + 554,400. Let me add those numbers: 626,400 + 554,400. Hmm, 626k plus 554k is 1,180,800. So the total revenue has to be at least $1,180,800.\n\nRevenue is the selling price per unit multiplied by the number of units sold. Since they sell all components each month, their revenue is (price per unit) * 5040 units. Let me denote the price per unit as P. So, revenue = P * 5040.\n\nWe know that revenue needs to be at least $1,180,800. So, P * 5040 >= 1,180,800. To find the minimum P, we can divide both sides by 5040.\n\nSo, P >= 1,180,800 / 5040. Let me compute that. Hmm, 5040 goes into 1,180,800 how many times? Let me see. Let me simplify the division.\n\nFirst, let me see what 5040 is in terms of factors. 5040 is 504 * 10, which is 56 * 9 * 10. But maybe I can divide both numerator and denominator by 10 to make it easier. So, 1,180,800 \u00f7 10 is 118,080, and 5040 \u00f7 10 is 504. So now, 118,080 / 504.\n\nHmm, let's see if 504 goes into 118,080. Let me try dividing 118,080 by 504.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can simplify the numbers by dividing numerator and denominator by some common factors. Let's see:\n\n504 = 56 * 9 = 7*8 * 3^2.\n\n118,080. Let's see if 504 divides into it. Let me see: 504 * 200 is 100,800. Subtract that from 118,080: 118,080 - 100,800 = 17,280. Now, how much is 504 into 17,280?\n\nWait, 504 * 34 is 504*(30+4) = 15,120 + 2,016 = 17,136. Hmm, but 17,280 is more. So 34 gives 17,136. The difference is 17,280 -17,136=144.\n\nSo 504 * 34 =17,136, and then 504 * 0.2857 (since 144 is 504 * (144/504) )= 0.2857 approximately. So 34.2857.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute 118080 / 504.\n\nAlternatively, let me do it step by step. Let's compute 118080 \u00f7 504.\n\nDividing 118080 by 504:\n\n504 * 200 = 100,800.\n\nSubtract: 118,080 - 100,800 = 17,280.\n\nNow, 504 * 34 = 17,136 (because 504 *30=15,120, 504*4=2,016; 15,120+2,016=17,136).\n\nSubtract 17,136 from 17,280: 17,280 -17,136=144.\n\nSo, that's 200 +34 =234, and 144 left.\n\nNow, 504 goes into 144 how many times? 0.2857 times. So, 234 + 0.2857 \u2248234.2857.\n\nSo, approximately 234.2857 dollars.\n\nBut the options are all whole numbers. So, P must be at least 234.2857, so the next whole number is 235. But wait, looking at the options, the choices are 226, 230, 240, etc. Hmm, none of the options are 235. So did I make a mistake in my calculation?\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I made an error in the initial steps. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, let's go back. The company's monthly production is 420 units. So, annual production is 420 *12 =5040 units. Correct.\n\nCost per unit is $110, so total cost is 5040 * 110. Let me compute that again. 5040 * 100 is 504,000. 5040 *10 is 50,400. So 504,000 +50,400=554,400. Correct.\n\nDesired profit is $626,400. So, total revenue required is 554,400 +626,400 = 1,180,800. Correct.\n\nSo revenue is P * 5040 >=1,180,800.\n\nSo P >=1,180,800 /5040.\n\nLet me compute 1,180,800 /5040.\n\nWait, perhaps I can simplify the division by canceling zeros. 1,180,800 \u00f75040.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: 118,080 /504.\n\nAgain, 118,080 \u00f7504. Let me try another approach. Let's see how many times 504 goes into 118,080.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 1,180,800 \u00f75040 by simplifying the numbers. Let me see:\n\n1,180,800 \u00f75040 = (1,180,800 \u00f7 10) \u00f7 (5040 \u00f710) )= 118,080 \u00f7 504.\n\nHmm, 504 * 200 is 100,800. Subtract that from 118,080: 17,280.\n\n504 *34 = 17,136. So 17,280 -17,136 =144.\n\nSo 200 +34=234, and 144 left.\n\n504 goes into 144 zero times, but in decimal, 144 is 144/504 = 0.2857.\n\nSo, 234.2857. So P must be at least 234.2857.\n\nBut the options don't have 234. The closest higher option is B)230 and C)240. Wait, 234.2857 is between 230 and 240. But 234.29 is higher than 230, so 230 wouldn't be enough. The price needs to be higher than 234.28, so the minimum price from the options would be 240.\n\nWait, but looking at the options: A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nWait, 234.28 is approximately 234.30, which is between B and C. So the minimum price that guarantees the profit is 240. So the correct answer would be C)240.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me cross-verify.\n\nAlternative approach: Let me compute 5040 * P >= 1,180,800.\n\nSo P >= 1,180,800 /5040.\n\nLet me compute that.

So 504*234=117,936. Now, 118,080 -117,936=144. So 144/504=0.2857.\n\nSo P is 234.2857. So to get at least that, the price must be at least 234.29.

So 1,159,200 is less than 1,180,800. So 230 would not be enough. So the next option is 240.\n\nLet me compute 5040 *240.\n\n5040 *200=1,008,000.\n\n5040 *40=201,600.\n\nTotal is 1,209,600. Which is more than 1,180,800. So 240 gives a revenue higher than needed.\n\nSo the minimum price is 234.28, but since the options don't have that, we pick the next higher option, which is C)240.\n\n\nTo determine the minimum selling price per component that guarantees a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we start by calculating the total production cost and revenue required.\n\n1. **Annual Production**: The company produces 420 units per month, so annually, it produces:  \n   \\[\n   420 \\, \\text{units/month} \\times 12 \\, \\text{months} = 5040 \\, \\text{units}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Total Production Cost**: The production cost per unit is $110, so the total production cost for the year is:  \n   \\[\n   5040 \\, \\text{units} \\times 110 \\, \\text{\\$/unit} = 554,400 \\, \\text{\\$}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Required Revenue**: The desired annual profit is $626,400.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out this problem. Let's see, the company makes 420 units every month. Each unit costs them $110 to produce. They sell all of them each month. I need to find the minimum selling price per component so that the yearly profit is at least $626,400.\n\nWait, profit is revenue minus costs, right? So first, let's break it down into monthly and then yearly.\n\nSo each month, they produce 420 units. Their cost per unit is $110, so the total cost per month is 420 * 110. Let me calculate that. 420 * 100 is 42,000 and 420 * 10 is 4,200, so total is 46,200 per month. So each month, their cost is $46,200.\n\nRevenue per month is the selling price per unit multiplied by 420 units. Let's call the selling price 'p'. So revenue is 420p.\n\nProfit per month is revenue minus cost. So 420p - 46,200. \n\nBut the question is about the yearly profit. So over a year, that's 12 months. So the total profit needs to be at least $626,400.\n\nSo the equation for the total yearly profit is 12*(420p - 46200) >= 626400.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n12*(420p - 46200) >= 626400\n\nHmm, let's simplify this. First, maybe expand the left side.\n\n420p * 12 is ... 420 *12. Let's compute that. 400*12=4800, 20*12=240, so 4800+240=5040. So 5040p.\n\nAnd 46200 *12 is ... Let me compute 46200*10=462000, plus 46200*2=92400. So total is 462000 +92400=554400.\n\nSo the inequality becomes:\n\n5040p - 554400 >= 626400\n\nNow, let's add 554400 to both sides to get:\n\n5040p >= 626400 + 554400\n\nAdding those numbers: 626400 + 554400. Let's see, 626400 +500000 is 1,126,400, then add 54,400: 1,126,400 +54,400 = 1,180,800. So,\n\n5040p >= 1,180,800\n\nNow, divide both sides by 5040 to solve for p.\n\np >= 1,180,800 / 5040\n\nLet me compute that division.\n\nHmm, 5040 goes into 1,180,800 how many times?\n\nAlternatively, maybe simplify the fraction. Let's see, both numerator and denominator can be divided by 10: 118080 / 504.\n\nWait, 504 times 200 is 100,800. 504 * 234 would be more. Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 1,180,800 divided by 5040.\n\nWait, 5040 * 200 is 1,008,000. Subtract that from 1,180,800: 1,180,800 -1,008,000=172,800.\n\nNow, 5040 * 34 is 5040 *30=151,200, plus 5040*4=20,160. So 151200+20160=171,360. Hmm, 5040*34=171,360. So 172,800 -171,360=1,440.\n\nWait, 5040 * 0.2857 is about 1440? Wait, 5040 * (1440/5040) = 1440. So 5040 * (1/3.5) maybe? Or perhaps 5040 * 0.2857 \u22481440. So total is 200 +34 +0.2857 \u2248234.2857.\n\nSo p is approximately 234.2857.\n\nBut since the selling price must be a whole number, and we need the minimum price that guarantees the profit, we have to round up to the next whole dollar. So 235?\n\nWait, but let me double-check the division.\n\nWait, 5040 * 234 = 5040*(200 +34)=5040*200 +5040*34.\n\n5040*200=1,008,000.\n\n5040*34: let's compute 5040*30=151,200 and 5040*4=20,160. So 151,200 +20,160=171,360.\n\nSo 1,008,000 +171,360=1,179,360.\n\nWait, but 5040 *234=1,179,360. But our numerator is 1,180,800.\n\nSo 1,180,800 -1,179,360=1,440.\n\nSo 5040 *234 =1,179,360.\n\nSo 1,180,800 is 1,179,360 +1,440.\n\nSo 1,440 /5040 = 0.285714...\n\nSo p is 234 + 0.2857=234.2857.\n\nSo p is approximately 234.2857. Since the price must be at least this, and you can't sell for a fraction of a dollar, you need to round up. So the minimum price is $235.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, the options are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nHmm, 235 isn't one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate the division step. Maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, 1,180,800 divided by 5040.\n\nAnother approach: let's divide numerator and denominator by 10 to make it easier: 118,080 / 504.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can simplify 118080 \u00f7504.\n\nLet me see if 504 divides into 118080.\n\nCompute 504 \u00d7 200 = 100,800.\n\nSubtract that from 118,080: 118,080 -100,800=17,280.\n\nNow, how many times does 504 go into 17,280?\n\n504 \u00d7 34 = 17,136. Because 504 \u00d730=15,120, 504\u00d74=2,016 \u2192 15,120+2,016=17,136.\n\nSubtract 17,136 from 17,280: 17,280 -17,136=144.\n\nSo 504 \u00d7 (34 + 0.2857) = 34.2857.\n\nSo 200 +34.2857=234.2857.\n\nSame result as before.\n\nSo p is about 234.2857. So the minimum price is $235, but that's not an option. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's go back to the problem statement. Maybe I messed up the profit calculation.\n\nWait, the company's cost is $110 per component. So each month, cost is 420 * 110= $46,200.\n\nRevenue is 420 * p. Profit per month is 420p -46,200.\n\nYearly profit is 12*(420p -46,200) \u2265 626,400.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute this as yearly profit directly, rather than per month.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the required total profit per year, then find per unit.\n\nSo the total profit required is $626,400.\n\nTotal units produced in a year: 420 *12= 5040 units.\n\nTotal cost per year: 5040 *110 = 554,400.\n\nTotal revenue needed: 554,400 +626,400= 1,180,800.\n\nSo total revenue is 5040p \u2265 1,180,800.\n\nWhich gives p \u22651,180,800 /5040 = 234.2857. So same as before.\n\nSo again, p is about 234.29, so minimum is 235. But options don't have 235. Closest higher is 240.\n\nWait, looking at the options: option C is 240. So is 240 the answer? Because 235 isn't an option, but perhaps I miscalculated something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem states that the profit is at least $626,400 per year. So maybe I should compute the minimum p such that 12*(420p -46200) \u2265626400.\n\nLet me compute that again.\n\n12*(420p -46200) \u2265626400.\n\nDivide both sides by 12: 420p -46200 \u2265 52,200.\n\nThen, 420p \u2265 52,200 +46,200=98,400.\n\nSo p \u226598,400 /420.\n\n98,400 divided by 420.\n\nLet me compute 420 \u00d7234= 98,  let's see: 420 \u00d7200=84,000. 420\u00d734=14,280. So 84,000+14,280=98,280. So 420 \u00d7234=98,280.\n\n98,400 -98,280=120.\n\nSo 120/420= 0.2857.\n\nSo p=234 +0.2857=234.2857. Same as before.\n\nSo the minimum p is approximately 234.29, so 235, but since 235 isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the total profit. Let me check:\n\nWait, is the yearly profit the total for the year, which is 12 times the monthly profit. So, 12*(420p -46200) >=626400.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute 420*(p-110) per month, because profit per unit is (p-110), and times 420 units.\n\nSo profit per month is 420*(p-110). Yearly profit is 12*420*(p-110) \u2265626,400.\n\nSo 12*420=5040. So 5040*(p-110) \u2265626,400.\n\nDivide both sides by 5040: p-110 \u2265626400/5040.\n\nCompute 626400 /5040.\n\nHmm, 5040 \u00d7 124= 5040 \u00d7120=604,800. 5040 \u00d74=20,160. So 604800 +20,160=624,960.\n\nWait, 5040 \u00d7124=624,960. But 626,400 is 626,400 -624,960=1,440 more.\n\nSo 1,440 /5040= 0.2857.\n\nSo p-110 \u2265124.2857 \u2192 p \u2265110 +124.2857=234.2857.\n\nAgain, same result. So the price per unit must be at least approximately 234.29. Since they can't set a fractional price, they have to round up to 235.\n\nBut the options don't have 235. So perhaps the options have a typo, or perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, the options are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nSo the closest option above 234.29 is 240. So option C is 240.\n\nBut why is 240 the correct answer? Because 235 isn't an option. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is about gross profit, which is revenue minus cost. So perhaps the calculation is correct.\n\nWait, let me compute the profit for p=234.29:\n\nMonthly units:420. Revenue:420*234.29= let's see, 420*234=98,280, 420*0.29=121.8. So total revenue per month \u224898,280 +121.8=98,401.8.\n\nCost per month:46,200.\n\nProfit per month:98,401.8 -46,200=52,201.8.\n\nYearly profit:52,201.8 *12=626,421.6, which is just over 626,400. So at p=234.29, the profit is just enough.\n\nBut since you can't set a price at 234.29, you have to go to the next dollar, which is 235. But the options don't have 235. So perhaps I need to see what the profit would be at p=230.\n\nCompute p=230.\n\nProfit per month:420*(230-110)=420*120=50,400.\n\nYearly profit:50,400 *12=604,800. Which is less than 626,400.\n\nSo that's not enough. So p=230 is too low.\n\nNext option is 240.\n\np=240.\n\nProfit per month:420*(240-110)=420*130=54,600.\n\nYearly:54,600 *12=655,200, which is more than 626,400. So p=240 is acceptable.\n\nBut is there a lower price in the options that would suffice? The next option lower than 240 is 230, which we saw gives only 604,800, which is insufficient.\n\nSo the minimum price among the options is 240. So the correct answer is C)240.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out this problem. Let's see, the company makes 420 units every month. Each unit costs them $110 to produce. They sell all of them each month. I need to find the minimum selling price per component so that the yearly profit is at least $626,400.\n\nWait, profit is revenue minus costs, right? So first, let's break it down into monthly and then yearly.\n\nSo each month, they produce 420 units. Their cost per unit is $110, so the total cost per month is 420 * 110. Let me calculate that. 420 * 100 is 42,000 and 420 * 10 is 4,200, so total is 46,200 per month. So each month, their cost is $46,200.\n\nRevenue per month is the selling price per unit multiplied by 420 units. Let's call the selling price 'p'. So revenue is 420p.\n\nProfit per month is revenue minus cost. So 420p - 46,200. \n\nBut the question is about the yearly profit. So over a year, that's 12 months. So the total profit needs to be at least $626,400.\n\nSo the equation for the total yearly profit is 12*(420p - 46200) >= 626400.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n12*(420p - 46200) >= 626400\n\nHmm, let's simplify this. First, maybe expand the left side.\n\n420p * 12 is ... 420 *12. Let's compute that. 400*12=4800, 20*12=240, so 4800+240=5040. So 5040p.\n\nAnd 46200 *12 is ... Let me compute 46200*10=462000, plus 46200*2=92400. So total is 462000 +92400=554400.\n\nSo the inequality becomes:\n\n5040p - 554400 >= 626400\n\nNow, let's add 554400 to both sides to get:\n\n5040p >= 626400 + 554400\n\nAdding those numbers: 626400 + 554400. Let's see, 626400 +500000 is 1,126,400, then add 54,400: 1,126,400 +54,400 = 1,180,800. So,\n\n5040p >= 1,180,800\n\nNow, divide both sides by 5040 to solve for p.\n\np >= 1,180,800 / 5040\n\nLet me compute that division.\n\nHmm, 5040 goes into 1,180,800 how many times?\n\nAlternatively, maybe simplify the fraction. Let's see, both numerator and denominator can be divided by 10: 118080 / 504.\n\nWait, 504 times 200 is 100,800. 504 * 234 would be more. Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 1,180,800 divided by 5040.\n\nWait, 5040 * 200 is 1,008,000. Subtract that from 1,180,800: 1,180,800 -1,008,000=172,800.\n\nNow, 5040 * 34 is 5040 *30=151,200, plus 5040*4=20,160. So 151200+20160=171,360. Hmm, 5040*34=171,360. So 172,800 -171,360=1,440.\n\nWait, 5040 * 0.2857 is about 1440? Wait, 5040 * (1440/5040) = 1440. So 5040 * (1/3.5) maybe? Or perhaps 5040 * 0.2857 \u22481440. So total is 200 +34 +0.2857 \u2248234.2857.\n\nSo p is approximately 234.2857.\n\nBut since the selling price must be a whole number, and we need the minimum price that guarantees the profit, we have to round up to the next whole dollar. So 235?\n\nWait, but let me double-check the division.\n\nWait, 5040 * 234 = 5040*(200 +34)=5040*200 +5040*34.\n\n5040*200=1,008,000.\n\n5040*34: let's compute 5040*30=151,200 and 5040*4=20,160. So 151,200 +20,160=171,360.\n\nSo 1,008,000 +171,360=1,179,360.\n\nWait, but 5040 *234=1,179,360. But our numerator is 1,180,800.\n\nSo 1,180,800 -1,179,360=1,440.\n\nSo 5040 *234 =1,179,360.\n\nSo 1,180,800 is 1,179,360 +1,440.\n\nSo 1,440 /5040 = 0.285714...\n\nSo p is 234 + 0.2857=234.2857.\n\nSo p is approximately 234.2857. Since the price must be at least this, and you can't sell for a fraction of a dollar, you need to round up. So the minimum price is $235.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, the options are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nHmm, 235 isn't one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate the division step. Maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, 1,180,800 divided by 5040.\n\nAnother approach: let's divide numerator and denominator by 10 to make it easier: 118,080 / 504.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can simplify 118080 \u00f7504.\n\nLet me see if 504 divides into 118080.\n\nCompute 504 \u00d7 200 = 100,800.\n\nSubtract that from 118,080: 118,080 -100,800=17,280.\n\nNow, how many times does 504 go into 17,280?\n\n504 \u00d7 34 = 17,136. Because 504 \u00d730=15,120, 504\u00d74=2,016 \u2192 15,120+2,016=17,136.\n\nSubtract 17,136 from 17,280: 17,280 -17,136=144.\n\nSo 504 \u00d7 (34 + 0.2857) = 34.2857.\n\nSo 200 +34.2857=234.2857.\n\nSame result as before.\n\nSo p is about 234.2857. So the minimum price is $235, but that's not an option. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's go back to the problem statement. Maybe I messed up the profit calculation.\n\nWait, the company's cost is $110 per component. So each month, cost is 420 * 110= $46,200.\n\nRevenue is 420 * p. Profit per month is 420p -46,200.\n\nYearly profit is 12*(420p -46,200) \u2265 626,400.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute this as yearly profit directly, rather than per month.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the required total profit per year, then find per unit.\n\nSo the total profit required is $626,400.\n\nTotal units produced in a year: 420 *12= 5040 units.\n\nTotal cost per year: 5040 *110 = 554,400.\n\nTotal revenue needed: 554,400 +626,400= 1,180,800.\n\nSo total revenue is 5040p \u2265 1,180,800.\n\nWhich gives p \u22651,180,800 /5040 = 234.2857. So same as before.\n\nSo again, p is about 234.29, so minimum is 235. But options don't have 235. Closest higher is 240.\n\nWait, looking at the options: option C is 240. So is 240 the answer? Because 235 isn't an option, but perhaps I miscalculated something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem states that the profit is at least $626,400 per year. So maybe I should compute the minimum p such that 12*(420p -46200) \u2265626400.\n\nLet me compute that again.\n\n12*(420p -46200) \u2265626400.\n\nDivide both sides by 12: 420p -46200 \u2265 52,200.\n\nThen, 420p \u2265 52,200 +46,200=98,400.\n\nSo p \u226598,400 /420.\n\n98,400 divided by 420.\n\nLet me compute 420 \u00d7234= 98,  let's see: 420 \u00d7200=84,000. 420\u00d734=14,280. So 84,000+14,280=98,280. So 420 \u00d7234=98,280.\n\n98,400 -98,280=120.\n\nSo 120/420= 0.2857.\n\nSo p=234 +0.2857=234.2857. Same as before.\n\nSo the minimum p is approximately 234.29, so 235, but since 235 isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the total profit. Let me check:\n\nWait, is the yearly profit the total for the year, which is 12 times the monthly profit. So, 12*(420p -46200) >=626400.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute 420*(p-110) per month, because profit per unit is (p-110), and times 420 units.\n\nSo profit per month is 420*(p-110). Yearly profit is 12*420*(p-110) \u2265626,400.\n\nSo 12*420=5040. So 5040*(p-110) \u2265626,400.\n\nDivide both sides by 5040: p-110 \u2265626400/5040.\n\nCompute 626400 /5040.\n\nHmm, 5040 \u00d7 124= 5040 \u00d7120=604,800. 5040 \u00d74=20,160. So 604800 +20,160=624,960.\n\nWait, 5040 \u00d7124=624,960. But 626,400 is 626,400 -624,960=1,440 more.\n\nSo 1,440 /5040= 0.2857.\n\nSo p-110 \u2265124.2857 \u2192 p \u2265110 +124.2857=234.2857.\n\nAgain, same result. So the price per unit must be at least approximately 234.29. Since they can't set a fractional price, they have to round up to 235.\n\nBut the options don't have 235. So perhaps the options have a typo, or perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, the options are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nSo the closest option above 234.29 is 240. So option C is 240.\n\nBut why is 240 the correct answer? Because 235 isn't an option. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is about gross profit, which is revenue minus cost. So perhaps the calculation is correct.\n\nWait, let me compute the profit for p=234.29:\n\nMonthly units:420. Revenue:420*234.29= let's see, 420*234=98,280, 420*0.29=121.8. So total revenue per month \u224898,280 +121.8=98,401.8.\n\nCost per month:46,200.\n\nProfit per month:98,401.8 -46,200=52,201.8.\n\nYearly profit:52,201.8 *12=626,421.6, which is just over 626,400. So at p=234.29, the profit is just enough.\n\nBut since you can't set a price at 234.29, you have to go to the next dollar, which is 235. But the options don't have 235. So perhaps I need to see what the profit would be at p=230.\n\nCompute p=230.\n\nProfit per month:420*(230-110)=420*120=50,400.\n\nYearly profit:50,400 *12=604,800. Which is less than 626,400.\n\nSo that's not enough. So p=230 is too low.\n\nNext option is 240.\n\np=240.\n\nProfit per month:420*(240-110)=420*130=54,600.\n\nYearly:54,600 *12=655,200, which is more than 626,400. So p=240 is acceptable.\n\nBut is there a lower price in the options that would suffice? The next option lower than 240 is 230, which we saw gives only 604,800, which is insufficient.\n\nSo the minimum price among the options is 240. So the correct answer is C)240.\n\n\nTo determine the minimum selling price per component that guarantees a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we start by analyzing the company's costs and revenue.\n\n### Key Information:\n- **Monthly production**: 420 units  \n- **Production cost per unit**: $110  \n- **Yearly profit target**: $626,400  \n\n### Monthly Profit Calculation:\n1. **Monthly cost**:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Monthly cost} = 420 \\times 110 = \\$46,200\n   \\]\n2. **Monthly revenue**:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Monthly revenue} = 420 \\times p\n   \\]\n   where \\( p \\) is the selling price per unit.\n3. **Monthly profit**:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Monthly profit} = \\text{Revenue} - \\text{Cost} = 420p - 46,200\n   \\]\n\n### Yearly Profit Calculation:\n1. **Yearly profit**:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Yearly profit} = 12 \\times (\\text{Monthly profit}) = 12 \\times (420p - 46,200)\n   \\]\n2. **Yearly profit target**:  \n   \\[\n   12 \\times (420p - 46,200) \\geq 626,400\n   \\]\n\n### Simplifying the Equation:\n1. Expand the equation:  \n   \\[\n   5040p - 554,400 \\geq 626,400\n   \\]\n2. Add \\( 554,400 \\) to both sides:  \n   \\[\n   5040p \\geq 1,180,800\n   \\]\n3. Divide by \\( 5040 \\):  \n   \\[\n   p \\geq \\frac{1,180,800}{5040} \\approx 234.29\n   \\]\n\n### Interpretation:\nThe minimum selling price per unit must be at least \\( \\$234.29 \\). Since the selling price must be a whole number, it is rounded up to \\( \\$235 \\). However, \\( \\$235 \\) is not one of the provided options. Among the given choices, the next higher price is \\( \\$240 \\).\n\n### Verification:\n1. **Profit at \\( p = 230 \\)**:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Monthly profit} = 420 \\times (230 - 110) = 50,400\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Yearly profit} = 12 \\times 50,400 = 604,800\n   \\]\n   This is less than \\( 626,400 \\), so \\( p = 230 \\) is insufficient.\n\n2. **Profit at \\( p = 240 \\)**:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Monthly profit} = 420 \\times (240 - 110) = 54,600\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Yearly profit} = 12 \\times 54,600 = 655,200\n   \\]\n   This exceeds \\( 626,400 \\), so \\( p = 240 \\) is acceptable.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe minimum selling price per component that guarantees the yearly profit target is \\( \\$240 \\).\n\n**Answer: C**",
