      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about simple interest. Let me think through it step by step. Hmm, the question says that professors borrowed Rs. 5000 from the university, and after 3 years, the university got Rs. 300 as interest. I need to find the rate of interest per annum.\n\nWait, right, simple interest. I remember the formula for simple interest is I = P * R * T. Where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest (in percentage), and T is the time in years. Oh right, and R is usually in decimal form when you plug it into the formula.\n\nSo let's plug in the numbers I have. The principal P is 5000 rupees. The time T is 3 years. The interest I is 300 rupees. I need to find R.\n\nSo rearranging the formula to solve for R: R = I / (P * T). Let me compute that. \n\nI is 300, P is 5000, T is 3. So R = 300 / (5000 * 3). Let me calculate the denominator first. 5000 multiplied by 3 is 15000. So R = 300 / 15000. Hmm, what's 300 divided by 15000? Let me do that division. \n\nWell, 15000 divided by 300 is 50, so 300 divided by 15000 is 1/50. Wait, 1/50 is 0.02. Oh wait, because 1 divided by 50 is 0.02. So R is 0.02, which is 2%. \n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Because sometimes I mix up the formula. So I = P*R*T. 5000 * R *3 should equal 300. So 5000 *3 is 15000. 15000 * R =300. So R = 300 /15000 = 0.02, which is 2% per annum. So the correct option is A) 2%.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, A is 2%, which matches. So the answer should be A.\n",
