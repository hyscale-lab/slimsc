      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a sporting goods store that sells golf balls. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nAlright, the store only carries yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day, they had 600 golf balls in stock. By the end of the day, they sold 80% of their inventory. So, first, maybe I should calculate how many they sold. \n\nWait, 80% of 600 is... let's see, 0.8 * 600 = 480. So they sold 480 golf balls. That means they have 600 - 480 = 120 left. But I don't know if that matters right now.\n\nThe problem says they sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls. Oh, and they sold all of their white golf balls. Hmm, so if they sold all the white ones, that means the white balls they had at the start must be equal to the number of white balls sold. And since they sold an equal number of yellow and white, the number of yellow sold is the same as white sold.\n\nWait, let me think. Let's denote the initial number of white golf balls as W and yellow as Y. So initially, W + Y = 600.\n\nThey sold 80% of the total, which is 480. Since they sold all the white balls, the number of white balls sold is W. And the number of yellow balls sold is Y_sold. According to the problem, Y_sold equals W because they sold equal numbers.\n\nSo the total sold is W + Y_sold = W + W = 2W. And this total is 480. So 2W = 480 \u2192 W = 240.\n\nWait, so the initial number of white balls was 240. Since the total initial was 600, the initial yellow balls must be 600 - 240 = 360. But wait, that would mean the store sold 240 white and 240 yellow, totaling 480. So yeah, that adds up.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Because if they started with 240 white, and sold all of them, that's 240. And for yellow, they started with 360, but sold 240. So after selling, they have 360 - 240 = 120 yellow left, which matches the 120 total left (since 600 - 480 is 120). So that makes sense.\n\nSo the initial number of yellow balls was 360. Looking at the options, option E is 360. But wait, the question is asking how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day, which is Y, which is 360. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait a second, let me check again. Because the initial yellow balls are Y, and they sold 240 of them, so Y must be at least 240. But since they started with Y=360, that's correct because they have 120 left. So yeah, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about the steps again. They sold 80% of the total, which is 480. Since they sold all white balls, the white balls sold is W. And the yellow sold is also W because they sold equal numbers. So total sold is 2W = 480 \u2192 W=240. So initial white was 240, initial yellow was 600-240=360. So the answer is E)360.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 360. So that's the correct choice.\n",

Hmm, so I think that means they sold 80% of 600, which I should calculate first.\n\nWait, 80% of 600 is 0.8 * 600. Let me do that math. 0.8 times 600 is 480.

They sold 240 white and 240 yellow, totaling 480, which is 80% of 600. That makes sense because 480 is 80% of 600. So after selling, they have 240 yellow left because 360 - 240 = 120? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says they sold 80% of their inventory. So the initial inventory was 600. They sold 480, so they have 120 left. Wait, but they started with 240 white and 360 yellow.

Let me think again. They sold all of their white balls. So the number of white balls they had at the beginning is equal to the number they sold. Because they sold all of them. And the number of yellow balls they sold is the same as the white ones they sold. So if they sold W white balls, they also sold W yellow balls. So total sold is 2W.\n\nWait, but the total sold is 80% of 600, right? Because they started with 600 and sold 80% of that. Let me calculate that. 80% of 600 is 0.8 * 600 = 480. So they sold 480 golf balls in total. And that's 2W, since they sold W white and W yellow. So 2W = 480. Then W is 240. So the number of white balls they had initially was 240. Because they sold all of them. \n\nSo if the total initial stock was 600, and white balls were 240, then the yellow balls must be 600 minus 240, which is 360. Wait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't mess up.\n\nWait, let me outline the steps again.\n\n1. Total initial stock: 600 balls.\n2. Sold 80% of inventory: 0.8 * 600 = 480 balls sold.\n3. Number of white balls sold equals the number of yellow balls sold.\n4. All white balls were sold, so white balls in stock at the start = number of white balls sold.\n5. Let W be the number of white balls at the start. So W = number of white balls sold. And since they sold equal numbers of yellow and white, the number of yellow balls sold is also W.\n6. Total sold is W (white) + W (yellow) = 2W = 480. So W = 240. So initial white balls were 240.\n7. So initial yellow balls were 600 - 240 = 360.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking how many yellow golf balls the store had to begin the day. So that's 360. Let me look at the options. Option E is 360. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me check the math again because sometimes I might get confused between percentages. So 80% sold, 20% left. So 20% of 600 is 120. So the store has 120 balls left at the end of the day. But does that affect the numbers? Because the 480 sold is 80% of the initial stock. So yes, the initial stock is 600, so 480 sold, 120 left.\n\nBut wait, since all white balls were sold, that means the number of white balls left is zero. So the 120 balls left must all be yellow. Because they sold all white ones, so only yellow remain. So let's see.\n\nIf initially, there were Y yellow and W white balls, so Y + W = 600.\n\nThey sold 80% of total, which is 480. So Y sold plus W sold equals 480. But W sold equals W because they sold all white balls. And Y sold equals W as well, because equal numbers of each were sold. So Y_sold = W. So total sold is W + W = 2W =480 \u2192 W=240. So initial white was 240, so initial yellow was 600-240=360.\n\nWait, but let me think about the remaining stock. Since all white balls were sold, the remaining 120 must be all yellow. So the initial Y was 360. They sold W=240, so Y_sold is 240. So initial Y minus sold Y is 360-240=120, which matches the 120 left. So that makes sense.\n\nSo the initial number of yellow balls was 360. So the answer should be E)360.\n",

So Y sold plus W sold equals 480. But W sold equals W because they sold all white balls. And Y sold equals W as well, because equal numbers of each were sold. So Y_sold = W. So total sold is W + W = 2W =480 \u2192 W=240. So initial white was 240, so initial yellow was 600-240=360.\n\nWait, but let me think about the remaining stock. Since all white balls were sold, the remaining 120 must be all yellow. So the initial Y was 360. They sold W=240, so Y_sold is 240. So initial Y minus sold Y is 360-240=120, which matches the 120 left. So that makes sense.\n\nSo the initial number of yellow balls was 360. So the answer should be E)360.\n\n\nThe store initially had 600 golf balls, with an equal number of yellow and white balls sold during the day. Since 80% of the inventory was sold, the total number of balls sold is:\n\n\\[\n0.8 \\times 600 = 480\n\\]\n\nThe store sold an equal number of yellow and white balls, and all white balls were sold. Let \\( W \\) represent the number of white balls initially in stock. Since all white balls were sold, \\( W \\) is the number of white balls sold. Similarly, the number of yellow balls sold is also \\( W \\), as the number of yellow and white balls sold is equal. Thus, the total number of balls sold is:\n\n\\[\nW \\, (\\text{white}) + W \\, (\\text{yellow}) = 2W\n\\]\n\nFrom the total number of balls sold:\n\n\\[\n2W = 480 \\implies W = 240\n\\]\n\nThis means the store initially had 240 white balls. Since the total initial inventory was 600, the number of yellow balls is:\n\n\\[\n600 - 240 = 360\n\\]\n\nThus, the store had 360 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day.\n\nAnswer: E",

That's equation one.\n\nThey sold 80% of the total, which is 480 balls. And because they sold an equal number of yellow and white, the number of each sold is 480 divided by 2, right?

So, first thought: 80% of 600 is how much? Let me calculate that. 80% is 0.8, so 0.8 * 600 = 480. So they sold 480 golf balls that day.\n\nWait, but the problem says they sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls. Oh, so the total sold is 480, and half of those are yellow and half are white. So that would mean they sold 240 yellow and 240 white. But wait, the problem also says that in doing so, they sold all of their white golf balls. So that means the number of white golf balls they had initially was exactly 240, because they sold all of them. Because if they had more white balls, they wouldn't have sold all of them; they would have only sold 240, same as yellow. But the problem states that they sold all their white balls, so the initial white count must have been 240.\n\nNow, the total initial stock was 600, so the initial yellow balls would be 600 minus the initial white balls. So 600 - 240 equals 360. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me think again. They sold 480 balls in total, half yellow and half white. So 240 each.

Because they sold all of them.\n\nLet me denote the number of white golf balls at the beginning as W. Then, since they sold all of them, the number of white balls sold is W. And because they sold an equal number of yellow and white balls, the number of yellow balls sold is also W. So the total sold is W (white) + W (yellow) = 2W. But we know the total sold is 480. So 2W = 480. Solving for W, I get W = 240. So they had 240 white golf balls at the start.\n\nWait, but the question is asking how many yellow golf balls the store had to begin with. The total initial stock was 600, which is the sum of yellow and white balls. So if white was 240, then yellow would be 600 - 240 = 360. So the answer should be 360, which is option E.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. They started with 360 yellow and 240 white. They sold all 240 white, and an equal number of yellow, which is 240. So they sold 240 yellow and 240 white, totaling 480, which is 80% of 600. That makes sense. So yes, the initial number of yellow golf balls was 360. So the correct answer is E.\n\n\nThe store had 600 golf balls at the beginning of the day and sold 80% of its inventory, which is \\( 0.8 \\times 600 = 480 \\) golf balls. Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and all of its white golf balls were sold, the number of white golf balls at the beginning must equal the number of white golf balls sold. Let \\( W \\) represent the number of white golf balls at the beginning. Then, the total number of golf balls sold is \\( W \\) (white) + \\( W \\) (yellow) = \\( 2W \\). Given that \\( 2W = 480 \\), solving for \\( W \\) gives \\( W = 240 \\). \n\nThe total initial stock of 600 golf balls is the sum of yellow and white golf balls. Therefore, the number of yellow golf balls at the beginning is \\( 600 - W = 600 - 240 = 360 \\). Thus, the store had 360 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day.\n\nAnswer: E",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. So I've got this problem about a sporting goods store and their golf balls. Hmm, the question is about figuring out how many yellow golf balls the store had at the beginning of the day. Alright, let's break it down.\n\nSo, the store only has yellow and white golf balls. At the start, they had 600 in total. By the end of the day, they sold 80% of their inventory. Wait, so that means they sold 80% of 600? Let me calculate that. 80% of 600 is 0.8 * 600, which is 480. So they sold 480 golf balls in total that day.\n\nNow, the problem says that they sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls. Oh, and also, they sold all of their white golf balls. So that means the number of white balls they had initially must be equal to the number they sold because they sold all of them. \n\nWait, but wait. They sold equal numbers of each. So the number of white balls sold equals the number of yellow balls sold. Let me think. Let's denote the number of white balls as W and the number of yellow balls as Y. So initially, W + Y = 600.\n\nThey sold 80% of the total, which is 480. And since they sold an equal number of each color, the number of white sold (which is W, because they sold all of them) is equal to the number of yellow sold (which would be Y_sold). So W = Y_sold. And since the total sold is 480, that's W + Y_sold = 480. But since W = Y_sold, that becomes 2W = 480. So W = 240. \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if W is 240, then Y_sold is also 240. So total sold is 240 + 240 = 480, which matches. Now, since the store sold all white balls, that means initially, W was 240. So the initial stock was W = 240, Y = 600 - W = 600 - 240 = 360. So the store had 360 yellow balls at the start.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, E is 360. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's go through it again.\n\nTotal sold is 480. They sold equal number of each. So each color contributed 240 to the total. Since all white were sold, initial white was 240. So initial yellow was 600 - 240 = 360. So yes, that seems right. So the answer should be E) 360.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Another way to think about it: the total sold is 480, half white and half yellow. So 240 white and 240 yellow. But since they sold all white balls, that means the initial number of white balls was 240. So initial yellow was 600 - 240 = 360. Yeah, that's consistent. So yeah, E is correct.\n",
