      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about tires and costs. Hmm, let me try to understand it. So, the question is about calculating the average cost per year for new tires versus repairing the current ones and then finding out by what percentage the new tires' cost is higher.\n\nAlright, let me break it down. The new tires cost $180 each and last for four years. Alternatively, the customer can repair their current tires for $40 each, which extends their life by one year. Wait, wait. So, if the current tires are already in use, maybe they've been used for some time already? Or does the repair add an extra year beyond their original lifespan? The problem says the new tires last for four years when purchased. But the repair makes the current tires last one more year. So perhaps the current tires have some life left, but the repair adds an extra year.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's see. The customer has the option to buy new tires for $180 each, which will last four years. Or repair the current tires for $40 each, which makes them last one additional year. Wait, but the original lifespan isn't given. Hmm. Oh, the problem says when purchased new, the tires last four years. So, perhaps the current tires are already in use, and if you repair them, they'll last one more year beyond their current state. But the question is about the average cost per year for each option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the current tires are about to fail, and the repair will make them last one more year, so instead of four years, maybe they're getting an extra year beyond what they would have otherwise. Or perhaps the current tires have already been in use for a certain period, but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the customer can choose to purchase the new tires or have his current tires repaired.\" So, the current tires are already on the car. If he repairs them, they'll last one more year. So, perhaps the current tires have been used for a certain period, and without repair, they would last an additional three years? Or wait, maybe the original tires when new last four years. So, if the customer is considering the new tires, which last four years, or repairing the current ones for one more year.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are already being used, and if you repair them, they will last for one more year beyond their current state. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years.\" So, when you buy them new, they last four years. So, the customer's current tires are probably older. But the problem doesn't specify how old they are. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the alternative is between purchasing new tires (which last four years) or repairing the current ones (so that they last one more year). So, the current tires are perhaps at the end of their four-year life, and repairing them would give one more year. So, the customer can choose between replacing them now with new ones (which last four years) or repairing them for one more year.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the current tires have been used for a certain time and can be repaired for one more year. But without knowing their current age, maybe the problem is assuming that the current tires have some life left, but the repair adds one year beyond that.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simpler. Let's think about the cost per year for each option.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires at $180 each, which last four years. So, the average cost per year is total cost divided by four years.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires for $40 each, which makes them last one additional year. Wait, but how much life do the current tires have after repair? Or is it that the repair gives an extra year beyond their original lifespan? For example, without repair, they might last three years, and with repair, they last four?\n\nWait, the problem says \"the repair will make the current tires last for one additional year.\" So, perhaps the current tires are already in use, and without repair, they would last, say, three years more. But with repair, they last four more years. Or wait, maybe the current tires are in their third year and can be repaired to last one more year, making their total lifespan four years.\n\nWait, but without knowing their current age, maybe the problem is intended to consider that the repair adds one year to the lifespan, making the total lifespan four years (like the new tires). Or perhaps it's that the repair adds one year beyond their original lifespan.\n\nI think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should read the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: A customer can choose to purchase new tires at $180 per tire or have his current tires repaired at $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\n\nWait, so the repair adds one more year to the current tires' life. So, if the customer chooses to repair, he pays $40 per tire and the tires last one more year than they otherwise would. But how long would they last without the repair?\n\nAh, perhaps without repair, the current tires would last three years, and with repair, four years. But that's an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the current tires are about to wear out and the repair gives them one more year. So, the total life after repair is one year.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when purchased new, the tires last four years. So perhaps the current tires are four years old, and without repair, they would last another year (total five?), but that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the current tires are four years old and need to be replaced. The repair adds one more year beyond their current state, making them last one more year (so a total of five years from purchase?), but that seems unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires have some remaining life, but the repair adds an extra year beyond that. So, if they have two years left without repair, with repair, they last three. But since the problem doesn't specify, I think perhaps the intended approach is that the repair adds one year to the current tires' lifespan, making them last four years in total. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the total lifespan and the cost per year.\n\nLet me try this approach:\n\nFor new tires: cost is $180, lasts 4 years. So average cost per year is 180 / 4 = $45 per year.\n\nFor repairing: cost is $40, and they last one additional year. But wait, what's the total lifespan here? If the current tires are about to be replaced, and the repair gives them one more year, then the total lifespan is 4 years (original) + 1 year (repair) = 5 years? No, that doesn't make sense because the original lifespan is four years when new. If you repair, the current tires (which are already some years old) get an extra year.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering that the customer's current tires are at the point where they need to be replaced (i.e., they have been used for four years). So, if they repair them, they can get one more year. So the lifespan of the current tires would be 4 years (original) + 1 year (repair) = 5 years? No, that's not right because the original lifespan is four years when new. If you buy new tires, they last four years. If you repair the current tires, perhaps they last one more year beyond their current state. But without knowing how old the current tires are, perhaps the problem is implying that the repair extends their life by one year beyond their current state.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of the problem as: the customer has a choice between two options.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires for $180 each, which will last 4 years.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires for $40 each, which will make them last 1 additional year.\n\nWait, but the current tires are already in use. So, perhaps without repair, they would last for x years, and with repair, x + 1 years. But since the problem states that the new tires last four years, perhaps the current tires have been used for three years and without repair, would last one more year, making a total of four years. Then, with repair, they last two more years? No, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires are about to fail, and the repair gives them one more year of life. So, the cost for that one year is $40. So, the average cost per year for the repair option is $40 over 1 year, which is $40.\n\nWait, that would make the new tires cost $180 for 4 years, average $45 per year. The repair option is $40 for 1 year, average $40 per year.\n\nSo, the question is, what's the percentage increase from the repair cost to the new tire cost.\n\nSo, the new tires cost per year is $45, repair is $40. So the difference is $5. The percentage increase is (5 / 40) * 100% = 12.5%.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Because if the repair makes the tires last one more year, but how much is that in total?\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are about to last for one more year, and the repair adds one year, making them last two years. Or perhaps the repair adds one year to the current lifespan. The problem isn't entirely clear.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the customer can either buy new tires that last four years or repair the current ones for $40 each, which adds one year to their lifespan. So, the current tires, if not repaired, would last, say, three years more. With repair, they last four more years.\n\nWait, but without knowing how much life the current tires have, perhaps the problem is assuming that the repair gives them one additional year beyond their original lifespan. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be viewed as: the customer is considering whether to replace the tires now (buy new) or repair them for an extra year. So, if they buy new, the cost is $180 for four years. If they repair, they pay $40, and the tires last one more year (so one year total? Or the original lifespan plus one year?).\n\nI think I need to make an assumption here. Let me assume that the current tires are about to fail, and the repair gives them one more year. So, the customer can either:\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires for $180, which will last four years. So, the average cost is 180 / 4 = $45 per year.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires for $40, which makes them last one more year. So, the cost is $40 for one year. So, average cost is 40 / 1 = $40 per year.\n\nWait, that would mean the repair option is cheaper. Then the question is, the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the repair cost.\n\nSo, the new tires cost $45/year, repair is $40/year. The difference is $5. So, how much percent increase is $5 over $40? That's (5/40)*100% = 12.5%. So the answer would be C)12.5%.\n\nBut wait, another possibility is that the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year beyond their current lifespan. Suppose the current tires have been in use for three years, and without repair, they would last one more year (total four). With repair, they last two more years (total five). But I don't think the problem gives that information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires are about to last for three more years, and the repair adds one more year, making it four. So, the cost is $40 for four years. So, average cost per year is 40 /4 = $10.\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would make the repair option even cheaper. Then the new tires are $45 per year, repair is $10, so the percentage increase would be (45-10)/10 *100 = 350% increase, which is not an option.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as the repair giving an extra year beyond the original lifespan. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"the repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\" So, the current tires, without repair, would last a certain amount of time, and with repair, that time increases by one year. But without knowing the original lifespan, perhaps the intended interpretation is that the repair adds one year to the current tires' lifespan, making their total lifespan four years. Because the new tires last four years when new.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires have been used for three years, so without repair, they have one year left. With repair, they have two years left. But that would mean the repair adds one year beyond their current state. So, the lifespan after repair is 3+1=4 years. So, the cost is $40 for four years, which is 40/4 = $10 per year. Alternatively, maybe the customer is at the point where the tires are about to fail, so without repair, they would last one more year, and with repair, they last two years. But without knowing, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the repair adds one year to the current tires' lifespan, which is not specified, but maybe it's intended that the repair makes the current tires last for four years. But that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer is considering whether to buy new tires (which last four years) or repair the current ones, which would make them last one more year. So, the current tires are about to fail, and with repair, they last one year. So, the cost is $40 for one year. So, average cost is 40/1 = $40 per year.\n\nNew tires cost 180/4=45. So, 45 is what percent more than 40. The calculation is (45-40)/40 *100% = (5/40)*100=12.5%, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, another way to think is that the current tires, without repair, would last three more years. So, if the customer doesn't repair, they'd have three years left. If they repair, they have four years. So, the cost is $40 for four years. So, average cost is 40/4=10 per year. Then the new tires are 45, which is 350% higher than 10, which isn't an option. So that's probably not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair adds one year to the tires' current lifespan, but the problem states that the current tires can be repaired for $40 to make them last one additional year. So, perhaps the repair gives them one more year beyond their current lifespan.\n\nBut without knowing their current lifespan, perhaps the intended approach is to assume that the repair gives one year of life, and the cost is $40 for that year. So, average cost per year is 40/1=40. New tires are 180/4=45.\n\nSo, 45 is 5 more than 40. 5/40 is 0.125, which is 12.5%. So the answer is C.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C)12.5%.\n",

So that's probably not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair adds one year to the tires' current lifespan, but the problem states that the current tires can be repaired for $40 to make them last one additional year. So, perhaps the repair gives them one more year beyond their current lifespan.\n\nBut without knowing their current lifespan, perhaps the intended approach is to assume that the repair gives one year of life, and the cost is $40 for that year. So, average cost per year is 40/1=40. New tires are 180/4=45.\n\nSo, 45 is 5 more than 40. 5/40 is 0.125, which is 12.5%. So the answer is C.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C)12.5%.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage by which the average cost per year of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires, we analyze both options:\n\n### Option 1: New Tires\n- **Cost**: $180 per tire  \n- **Lifespan**: 4 years  \n- **Average Cost per Year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\$180}{4} = \\$45 \\text{ per year}\n  \\]\n\n### Option 2: Repairing Current Tires\n- **Cost**: $40 per tire  \n- **Additional Lifespan**: 1 year  \n- **Assumption**: The repair extends the lifespan of the current tires by 1 year, meaning the tires will last 1 year in total after repair.  \n- **Average Cost per Year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\$40}{1} = \\$40 \\text{ per year}\n  \\]\n\n### Percentage Increase\nTo find the percentage by which the average cost of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires:  \n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{New Tire Cost} - \\text{Repair Cost}}{\\text{Repair Cost}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\$45 - \\$40}{\\$40} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{\\$5}{\\$40} \\right) \\times 100 = 12.5\\%\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe average cost per year of new tires is **12.5%** greater than the cost of repairing the current tires.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about tires and their costs. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nAlright, the question is about comparing the average cost per year of buying new tires versus repairing the current ones. The goal is to find out by what percentage the new tires' average cost is higher than the repaired option.\n\nLet me read the details again. New tires last four years and cost $180 each. Repairing the current tires costs $40 each and extends their life by one year. So the current tires, without repair, probably last three years because the new ones last four, so maybe the old ones have three years left? Wait, actually, the problem says when purchased new, they last four years. So the customer's current tires must have been purchased new, so they were already in use for some time. But wait, the problem says the customer can choose to repair, which makes the current tires last one additional year. So before repair, the current tires have some life left, maybe three years? Or perhaps the original lifespan is four years, and the repair adds one more, making it five years? Hmm, no, the problem states that the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So, if the tires were already in use, perhaps they have three years left (since the new ones last four, and if they are being used, maybe they have one year left, but I'm not sure). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, the problem says when purchased new, the tires last four years. So, if the customer buys new tires now, they'll last four years. If they choose to repair their current tires, each repair costs $40 and makes them last one more year. So, the current tires, before repair, probably have three years left because after one repair, they'll last four years in total? Or is it that each repair adds one year, regardless of their current state?\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires have some remaining life. Let me think: when you buy new tires, they last four years. So, if the customer has had them for, say, three years, they would have one year left. If they repair, it adds one more year, making them last two more years after repair. But maybe the repair can be done multiple times? The problem doesn't specify, but the question is about the cost per year for each option.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is simpler. Let me consider each option's total cost and lifespan.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Each tire costs $180 and lasts four years.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires, which costs $40 per tire and extends their life by one year. So, how long do the current tires last after repair? Let's say the current tires were going to last for x years before repair. After repair, they last x + 1 years. But the problem states that when purchased new, they last four years. So perhaps the current tires are already three years old, and without repair, they have one year left. So repairing them would make them last two more years, for a total of four years? Or maybe the current tires have been in use for three years, so they have one year left, and the repair adds one, making them last two more years. Wait, but the problem says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So maybe the current tires, without repair, have three years left, and with repair, they last four years.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to look at it is that the new tires are bought and last four years. The current tires, if not repaired, would have a lifespan of four years when new, but since they're already in use, perhaps they have less time left. But the problem says that the repair adds one year. So, the customer can choose between buying new tires for $180 each, which last four years, or repair their current tires for $40 each, which makes them last one additional year. So, how long do the current tires last after repair?\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires, before repair, have three years of life left. Because when you buy new, they last four years, but if they are being used for three years, they have one more year. So, repairing them would add one year, making it two more years. Or maybe the current tires were bought new and have been in use for three years, so they have one year left. Repairing them would add one year, making them last two more years, so total four years from when they were new. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to model it differently.\n\nLet me think about the cost per year for each option.\n\nFor the new tires: cost is $180 per tire, lasts four years. So, the average cost per year is 180 / 4 = $45 per year per tire.\n\nFor the repair option: the customer pays $40 per tire to repair. How many years does this repair extend the tire's life? The problem says it makes the current tires last for one additional year. So, if the current tires were going to last, say, x years, now they last x + 1 years. But what is x? Because when new, they last four years. So perhaps the current tires have been in use for three years and have one year left. So, without repair, they'd last one more year, and with repair, they last two more years. So, the lifespan after repair is x + 1 = 4 years? Wait, no, because if they were bought new and are now three years old, they have one year left. Repairing would add one year, making them last two more years, for a total of four years from when they were new. So, the lifespan of the repaired tires is four years.\n\nWait, but that's the same as the new tires. So, if the new tires cost $180 for four years, and the repaired tires cost $40 for four years, then the cost per year would be 40 / 4 = $10 per year for the repair, and 180/4=45 for new. Then, the new tires are 45, repaired is 10. So the question is, how much greater is 45 than 10 in percentage terms.\n\nBut wait, maybe the repaired tires are only adding one year, making their total lifespan five years? No, the problem says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So, perhaps the current tires, without repair, have three years left, and with repair, they have four years. So, the lifespan is four years. Hmm, but that would mean that the new tires and the repaired tires both last four years. But then the cost per year for new is 180/4=45, and for repair, it's 40/4=10. So the new tires are 45, repair is 10.\n\nWait, but that would mean the new tires cost 45 per year, repair is 10 per year. So the question is, what's the percentage increase from repair to new.\n\nWait, but the question says, the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing. So, new is 45, repair is 10. So, how much greater is 45 than 10? The formula is ((45 - 10)/10) *100% = (35/10)*100=350%. That's not one of the options, so I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating the lifespan. Let me read the problem again.\n\nProblem statement: \"tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years. A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\"\n\nAh, so the current tires, if repaired, will last for one additional year. So, perhaps the current tires, without repair, have some lifespan left, and the repair adds one year.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify how much life the current tires have left. Hmm, this is a problem. Because without knowing how much longer the current tires would last without repair, we can't determine their total lifespan after repair.\n\nWait, maybe the customer is considering replacing the tires now, so the current tires have been in use for three years, and without repair, they have one more year. So, the repair adds one year, making their lifespan two more years. So, the lifespan is now three years (two years after repair, because they were used for three and now have two more years with repair). Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires were just purchased, so they are new, but that can't be because the customer is considering replacing them. Alternatively, maybe the current tires are used, and the problem is comparing replacing them now or repairing them now.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify how old the current tires are. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem states that when the tires are purchased new, they last for four years. The customer can choose to buy new tires at $180 each or repair the current tires for $40 each, which will make them last one additional year.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are already in use and have some remaining lifespan. The repair adds one year to their lifespan. So, if the current tires are about to fail, and without repair, they would last one more year, then with repair, they would last two more years. Alternatively, maybe the repair adds one year regardless of their current state.\n\nBut without knowing the current lifespan, how can we compute the average cost per year?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem assumes that the current tires have three years left, and the repair adds one year, making four years. So, in that case, the cost for repair is $40 for four years. Alternatively, perhaps the current tires, without repair, have three years of life, so they're in their third year, and will last one more year. Repairing them makes them last one additional year, so they now have two more years of life, making the total lifespan from when they were new four years (three years used, two more with repair? Hmm, this is getting confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to be that the current tires, if repaired, will last one more year beyond their current lifespan. So, if the current tires have been used for three years, they would last one more year without repair, and with repair, they last two more years, for a total of four years. So, the lifespan after repair is four years, same as new tires.\n\nWait, but then the repair cost is $40, and the new tires are $180. So, the cost per year for repair is 40/4=10, and for new, 180/4=45. So, the new tires cost 45 per year, repair is 10. So the question is, what's the percentage increase from repair to new. So (45-10)/10 = 350% increase. But the options don't have that. So I must have made a wrong assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires, when repaired, only last one additional year beyond their current lifespan. So, if they are about to fail, the repair would make them last one more year, not adding to the four-year lifespan.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, suppose the current tires are nearing the end of their lifespan. Let's say they have been in use for three years, and without repair, they would last one more year (total four years). But if repaired, they last one more year beyond that, making it two years of extended life. So the lifespan after repair is four (original) +1 (additional) = five years? No, because when you repair them, you're adding one year to their current lifespan. So if they have one year left, repair makes them last two years. So their lifespan after repair is two years.\n\nWait, but then the cost is $40 for two years. So, average cost per year is 40/2=20. New tires are $180 for four years, so 45 per year. So new is 45, repair is 20.\n\nSo, the question is, how much greater is 45 than 20 in percentage terms. So, (45-20)/20 *100% = 25/20 *100=125%. But that's not an option either. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nWhen new, tires last four years. So, if you buy new ones now, they'll last four years. If you repair your current tires, which cost $40 each, the tires will last one additional year. So, the current tires, without repair, would last for some period, and with repair, that period increases by one year.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify how long the current tires have been in use. So perhaps the intended approach is to consider that the current tires, without repair, have three years of life left, so repair adds one year, making four years. So, the cost is $40 for four years, which is $10 per year. New tires are $180 for four years, which is $45 per year. So, the new tires are 45, repair is 10. The percentage increase is (45-10)/10 = 3.5, which is 350%. But that's not an option. So perhaps the assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires, when repaired, only last one year. So, if you repair them, they last for one more year. So, the total lifespan is one year. So, the cost is $40 for one year, which is $40 per year. New tires are $180 for four years, which is $45 per year. So, new is 45, repair is 40. The percentage increase is (45-40)/40=5/40=0.125=12.5%. That's option C.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Let me see: if the current tires, without repair, would last one year, and with repair, they last one additional year, so two years. So, the repair cost is $40 for two years, which is $20 per year. But that brings us back to the earlier calculation, which didn't match the options.\n\nHmm, maybe the problem is that the repair adds one year, making the total lifespan of the current tires one year longer than they would have been without repair. But without knowing how much longer they would last without repair, it's impossible to calculate. So perhaps the problem is intended to assume that the current tires have already been used for three years, and without repair, they would last one more year. So, the repair adds one year, making their lifespan two more years. So, the total lifespan is four years (three + one with repair).\n\nWait, no, if they've been used for three years, and without repair, they would last one more, making four. Repair adds one, making five? Or is the repair adding one year beyond their current lifespan? So, if they're at three years, repair makes them last four years, not five. So, the lifespan after repair is four years. So, the cost is $40 for four years, so $10 per year. New tires are $45 per year. So, the increase is (45-10)/10=350%, which isn't an option.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let me try to think of another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to compare the cost of the new tires versus the cost of repairing, without considering the existing lifespan. So, for the same period, say, four years, the cost of new tires is $180, and the cost of repairing each year is $40. But that doesn't fit because the repair extends the life by one year, not for four.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer is considering whether to buy new tires now or repair the current ones now. So, the current tires, if repaired, will last one more year. So, the customer would have to repair them again after that, but the problem doesn't say anything about multiple repairs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. Let's assume that the current tires can be repaired once, adding one year to their lifespan. So, the current tires, if repaired, will last one more year beyond their current state. But without knowing how much they have left, perhaps the problem is intended to assume that the current tires are at the end of their lifespan. So, without repair, they would last one more year, and with repair, they last two more years. So, the repair cost is $40 for two years, which is $20 per year. New tires are $180 for four years, which is $45 per year. So, the average cost per year of new tires is (45-20)/20 *100% = 125% higher. But that's not an option.\n\nWait, but the options include 25%, which is 25% higher. So, perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer's current tires have three years of life left. So, without repair, they last three more years. Repair adds one, making four. So, the cost is $40 for four years, which is $10 per year. New tires are $45 per year. So, 45 is 350% higher than 10, which isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires have two years left. Repair adds one, making three years. So, the cost is $40 for three years, which is about $13.33 per year. New tires are $45 per year. So, 45-13.33=31.66. 31.66/13.33=2.375, which is 237.5% increase. Not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires have one year left. Repair adds one, making two years. So, cost is $40 for two years, which is $20 per year. New tires are $45. So, 45-20=25, which is 25/20=1.25, 125% increase. Not an option.\n\nWait, looking at the options, the highest is 25%, which is option E. So perhaps the correct calculation is 25%. How?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the current tires, when repaired, only last one additional year, so the total lifespan is one year. So, the repair cost is $40 for one year, which is $40 per year. New tires are $180 for four years, which is $45 per year. So, the new tires are 45, repair is 40. The difference is 5. So, (5/40)*100=12.5%, which is option C.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Let's see: if the current tires, without repair, have zero years left, and repairing them makes them last one year. So, the cost is $40 for one year, which is $40 per year. New tires are $180 for four years, so $45 per year. So, the new tires cost 45, repair is 40. The increase is 45/40 = 1.125, which is a 12.5% increase. So, the answer is C)12.5%.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the current tires are about to fail, and without repair, they would last zero years. That seems a bit odd, but perhaps that's the intended approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires, when repaired, will last one year beyond their current state. If they have three years left, repair makes it four. So, the cost is $40 for four years, which is $10 per year. New tires are $45. So, the increase is (45-10)/10=350%. Not an option.\n\nBut if the current tires have one year left, repair makes it two years. So, cost is $40 for two years, $20 per year. New is $45. So, the increase is (45-20)/20=125%. Not an option.\n\nBut if the current tires have one year left, and repair adds one, making two years. So, the cost is $40 for two years, which is $20 per year. New tires are $45 per year. So, the new tires are 45, repair is 20. So, (45-20)/20=125% increase, which is option not present.\n\nWait, but the options include 25% which is option E. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the current tires, when repaired, last one additional year beyond their current lifespan, but the current lifespan is not considered.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the repair allows the current tires to last one more year, making their total lifespan four years. So, the cost is $40 for four years, which is $10 per year. New tires are $45 per year. So, the increase is (45-10)/10=350%. Not an option.\n\nI'm getting stuck. Let me try to look for another approach. Maybe the question is not about the lifespan but about the cost over the same period. Let me think: perhaps the customer is considering replacing the tires now, and the current tires can be repaired for $40 each, which would allow them to last one more year, or they can buy new ones for $180 each, which will last four years.\n\nSo, the customer wants to compare the cost per year for both options. So, for the new tires: cost is $180 for four years, so $45 per year. For the repair: the tires are repaired for $40, and last one more year. So, the cost is $40 for one year, which is $40 per year. So, the new tires cost 45, repair is 40. The percentage increase is (45-40)/40=0.125=12.5%, which is option C.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, if the customer repairs, they pay $40 for one more year. If they buy new, they pay $180 for four years. So, the average cost per year for new is higher by 12.5%.\n\nYes, that fits one of the options. So, the answer is C)12.5%.\n",

Repairing would add one year, making them last two more years, for a total of four years from when they were new. So, the lifespan of the repaired tires is four years.\n\nWait, but that's the same as the new tires. So, if the new tires cost $180 for four years, and the repaired tires cost $40 for four years, then the cost per year would be 40 / 4 = $10 per year for the repair, and 180/4=45 for new. Then, the new tires are 45, repaired is 10. So the question is, how much greater is 45 than 10 in percentage terms.\n\nBut wait, maybe the repaired tires are only adding one year, making their total lifespan five years? No, the problem says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So, perhaps the current tires, without repair, have three years left, and with repair, they have four years. So, the lifespan is four years. Hmm, but that would mean that the new tires and the repaired tires both last four years. But then the cost per year for new is 180/4=45, and for repair, it's 40/4=10. So the new tires are 45, repair is 10.\n\nWait, but that would mean the new tires cost 45 per year, repair is 10 per year. So the question is, what's the percentage increase from repair to new.\n\nWait, but the question says, the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing. So, new is 45, repair is 10. So, how much greater is 45 than 10? The formula is ((45 - 10)/10) *100% = (35/10)*100=350%. That's not one of the options, so I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating the lifespan. Let me read the problem again.\n\nProblem statement: \"tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years. A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\"\n\nAh, so the current tires, if repaired, will last for one additional year. So, perhaps the current tires, without repair, have some lifespan left, and the repair adds one year.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify how much life the current tires have left. Hmm, this is a problem. Because without knowing how much longer the current tires would last without repair, we can't determine their total lifespan after repair.\n\nWait, maybe the customer is considering replacing the tires now, so the current tires have been in use for three years, and without repair, they have one more year. So, the repair adds one year, making their lifespan two more years. So, the lifespan is now three years (two years after repair, because they were used for three and now have two more years with repair). Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires were just purchased, so they are new, but that can't be because the customer is considering replacing them. Alternatively, maybe the current tires are used, and the problem is comparing replacing them now or repairing them now.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify how old the current tires are. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem states that when the tires are purchased new, they last for four years. The customer can choose to buy new tires at $180 each or repair the current tires for $40 each, which will make them last one additional year.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are already in use and have some remaining lifespan. The repair adds one year to their lifespan. So, if the current tires are about to fail, and without repair, they would last one more year, then with repair, they would last two more years. Alternatively, maybe the repair adds one year regardless of their current state.\n\nBut without knowing the current lifespan, how can we compute the average cost per year?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem assumes that the current tires have three years left, and the repair adds one year, making four years. So, in that case, the cost for repair is $40 for four years. Alternatively, perhaps the current tires, without repair, have three years of life, so they're in their third year, and will last one more year. Repairing them makes them last one additional year, so they now have two more years of life, making the total lifespan from when they were new four years (three years used, two more with repair? Hmm, this is getting confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to be that the current tires, if repaired, will last one more year beyond their current lifespan. So, if the current tires have been used for three years, they would last one more year without repair, and with repair, they last two more years, for a total of four years. So, the lifespan after repair is four years, same as new tires.\n\nWait, but then the repair cost is $40, and the new tires are $180. So, the cost per year for repair is 40/4=10, and for new, 180/4=45. So, the new tires cost 45 per year, repair is 10. So the question is, what's the percentage increase from repair to new. So (45-10)/10 = 350% increase. But the options don't have that. So I must have made a wrong assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires, when repaired, only last one additional year beyond their current lifespan. So, if they are about to fail, the repair would make them last one more year, not adding to the four-year lifespan.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, suppose the current tires are nearing the end of their lifespan. Let's say they have been in use for three years, and without repair, they would last one more year (total four years). But if repaired, they last one more year beyond that, making it two years of extended life. So the lifespan after repair is four (original) +1 (additional) = five years? No, because when you repair them, you're adding one year to their current lifespan. So if they have one year left, repair makes them last two years. So their lifespan after repair is two years.\n\nWait, but then the cost is $40 for two years. So, average cost per year is 40/2=20. New tires are $180 for four years, so 45 per year. So new is 45, repair is 20.\n\nSo, the question is, how much greater is 45 than 20 in percentage terms. So, (45-20)/20 *100% = 25/20 *100=125%. But that's not an option either. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nWhen new, tires last four years. So, if you buy new ones now, they'll last four years. If you repair your current tires, which cost $40 each, the tires will last one additional year. So, the current tires, without repair, would last for some period, and with repair, that period increases by one year.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify how long the current tires have been in use. So perhaps the intended approach is to consider that the current tires, without repair, have three years of life left, so repair adds one year, making four years. So, the cost is $40 for four years, which is $10 per year. New tires are $180 for four years, which is $45 per year. So, the new tires are 45, repair is 10. The percentage increase is (45-10)/10 = 3.5, which is 350%. But that's not an option. So perhaps the assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires, when repaired, only last one year. So, if you repair them, they last for one more year. So, the total lifespan is one year. So, the cost is $40 for one year, which is $40 per year. New tires are $180 for four years, which is $45 per year. So, new is 45, repair is 40. The percentage increase is (45-40)/40=5/40=0.125=12.5%. That's option C.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Let me see: if the current tires, without repair, would last one year, and with repair, they last one additional year, so two years. So, the repair cost is $40 for two years, which is $20 per year. But that brings us back to the earlier calculation, which didn't match the options.\n\nHmm, maybe the problem is that the repair adds one year, making the total lifespan of the current tires one year longer than they would have been without repair. But without knowing how much longer they would last without repair, it's impossible to calculate. So perhaps the problem is intended to assume that the current tires have already been used for three years, and without repair, they would last one more year. So, the repair adds one year, making their lifespan two more years. So, the total lifespan is four years (three + one with repair).\n\nWait, no, if they've been used for three years, and without repair, they would last one more, making four. Repair adds one, making five? Or is the repair adding one year beyond their current lifespan? So, if they're at three years, repair makes them last four years, not five. So, the lifespan after repair is four years. So, the cost is $40 for four years, so $10 per year. New tires are $45 per year. So, the increase is (45-10)/10=350%, which isn't an option.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let me try to think of another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to compare the cost of the new tires versus the cost of repairing, without considering the existing lifespan. So, for the same period, say, four years, the cost of new tires is $180, and the cost of repairing each year is $40. But that doesn't fit because the repair extends the life by one year, not for four.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer is considering whether to buy new tires now or repair the current ones now. So, the current tires, if repaired, will last one more year. So, the customer would have to repair them again after that, but the problem doesn't say anything about multiple repairs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. Let's assume that the current tires can be repaired once, adding one year to their lifespan. So, the current tires, if repaired, will last one more year beyond their current state. But without knowing how much they have left, perhaps the problem is intended to assume that the current tires are at the end of their lifespan. So, without repair, they would last one more year, and with repair, they last two more years. So, the repair cost is $40 for two years, which is $20 per year. New tires are $180 for four years, which is $45 per year. So, the average cost per year of new tires is (45-20)/20 *100% = 125% higher. But that's not an option.\n\nWait, but the options include 25%, which is 25% higher. So, perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer's current tires have three years of life left. So, without repair, they last three more years. Repair adds one, making four. So, the cost is $40 for four years, which is $10 per year. New tires are $45 per year. So, 45 is 350% higher than 10, which isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires have two years left. Repair adds one, making three years. So, the cost is $40 for three years, which is about $13.33 per year. New tires are $45 per year. So, 45-13.33=31.66. 31.66/13.33=2.375, which is 237.5% increase. Not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires have one year left. Repair adds one, making two years. So, cost is $40 for two years, which is $20 per year. New tires are $45. So, 45-20=25, which is 25/20=1.25, 125% increase. Not an option.\n\nWait, looking at the options, the highest is 25%, which is option E. So perhaps the correct calculation is 25%. How?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the current tires, when repaired, only last one additional year, so the total lifespan is one year. So, the repair cost is $40 for one year, which is $40 per year. New tires are $180 for four years, which is $45 per year. So, the new tires are 45, repair is 40. The difference is 5. So, (5/40)*100=12.5%, which is option C.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Let's see: if the current tires, without repair, have zero years left, and repairing them makes them last one year. So, the cost is $40 for one year, which is $40 per year. New tires are $180 for four years, so $45 per year. So, the new tires cost 45, repair is 40. The increase is 45/40 = 1.125, which is a 12.5% increase. So, the answer is C)12.5%.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the current tires are about to fail, and without repair, they would last zero years. That seems a bit odd, but perhaps that's the intended approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires, when repaired, will last one year beyond their current state. If they have three years left, repair makes it four. So, the cost is $40 for four years, which is $10 per year. New tires are $45. So, the increase is (45-10)/10=350%. Not an option.\n\nBut if the current tires have one year left, repair makes it two years. So, cost is $40 for two years, $20 per year. New is $45. So, the increase is (45-20)/20=125%. Not an option.\n\nBut if the current tires have one year left, and repair adds one, making two years. So, the cost is $40 for two years, which is $20 per year. New tires are $45 per year. So, the new tires are 45, repair is 20. So, (45-20)/20=125% increase, which is option not present.\n\nWait, but the options include 25% which is option E. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the current tires, when repaired, last one additional year beyond their current lifespan, but the current lifespan is not considered.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the repair allows the current tires to last one more year, making their total lifespan four years. So, the cost is $40 for four years, which is $10 per year. New tires are $45 per year. So, the increase is (45-10)/10=350%. Not an option.\n\nI'm getting stuck. Let me try to look for another approach. Maybe the question is not about the lifespan but about the cost over the same period. Let me think: perhaps the customer is considering replacing the tires now, and the current tires can be repaired for $40 each, which would allow them to last one more year, or they can buy new ones for $180 each, which will last four years.\n\nSo, the customer wants to compare the cost per year for both options. So, for the new tires: cost is $180 for four years, so $45 per year. For the repair: the tires are repaired for $40, and last one more year. So, the cost is $40 for one year, which is $40 per year. So, the new tires cost 45, repair is 40. The percentage increase is (45-40)/40=0.125=12.5%, which is option C.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, if the customer repairs, they pay $40 for one more year. If they buy new, they pay $180 for four years. So, the average cost per year for new is higher by 12.5%.\n\nYes, that fits one of the options. So, the answer is C)12.5%.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage by which the average cost per year of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires, we analyze both options:\n\n### Option 1: New Tires\n- **Cost**: $180 per tire  \n- **Lifespan**: 4 years  \n- **Average Cost per Year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{180}{4} = 45 \\, \\text{\\$/year}\n  \\]\n\n### Option 2: Repairing Current Tires\n- **Cost**: $40 per tire  \n- **Additional Lifespan**: 1 year  \n- **Assumption**: The current tires are about to fail and would not last beyond the next year without repair. With repair, they last for **1 additional year**.  \n- **Average Cost per Year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{40}{1} = 40 \\, \\text{\\$/year}\n  \\]\n\n### Percentage Increase\nThe question asks for the percentage by which the average cost per year of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires. Using the formula for percentage increase:  \n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{New Cost} - \\text{Repair Cost}}{\\text{Repair Cost}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:  \n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{45 - 40}{40} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{5}{40} \\right) \\times 100 = 12.5\\%\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe average cost per year of new tires is **12.5% greater** than the cost of repairing the current tires.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about tires and costs, and I need to figure out the percentage difference in the average cost per year between buying new tires and repairing the old ones. Hmm, let me break it down.\n\nAlright, so the question says that new tires last for four years and cost $180 each. Alternatively, you can repair the current tires for $40 each, and this repair makes them last one more year. The question is asking, what's the percentage increase in the average cost per year when choosing the new tires compared to repairing.\n\nWait, I think I need to calculate the average cost per year for both options and then find out what percentage the new tires' average cost is higher than the repaired ones.\n\nLet me start with the new tires. Each tire costs $180 and lasts four years. So the average cost per year for one tire would be the total cost divided by the number of years. That would be 180 divided by 4, right? So 180 / 4 equals 45. So each year, the cost is $45 on average.\n\nNow the repair option. The customer already has tires, and by repairing for $40, they get an extra year. So if the original tires were going to last, say, three years (since without repair, the problem says when purchased new they last four, but the current ones presumably are older? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The problem states that when new, tires last four years. But the customer already has some tires, and can choose to repair them for $40, making them last one more year. So let me think: if the customer's current tires are, say, three years old, and they repair them for $40, they get an extra year. Or maybe the current tires are in their third year, so adding one year would make it four. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify how old the current tires are. Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me re-read the problem.\n\nThe problem says: tires when purchased new last for four years. So a new tire is good for four years. The customer can either buy new tires at $180 each, which will last four years, or repair their current tires for $40 each, which will make the current tires last one additional year.\n\nWait, so the current tires, without repair, would last, perhaps, three more years? Or perhaps they're one year old? No, the problem doesn't specify. Hmm, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Because when you repair, you get one additional year. So if the current tires would have lasted, say, X years, repair makes them last X+1 years. But without knowing X, perhaps the question is assuming that the current tires are being considered for repair now, so that the repair gives them one more year beyond their current lifespan. Alternatively, perhaps the current tires are already one year old, and repair would make them last another three, but that's not clear.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the current tires as being at the point where they can be repaired for one more year. Let me think differently. Maybe the current tires, without repair, would last three years (since the new ones last four, but these are used). So when you repair them for $40, they last an additional year, making it four years total. Alternatively, perhaps the current tires are about to fail, so without repair, they would only last one more year, and with repair, they last two more years. But without knowing, perhaps the problem is assuming that the current tires are about to last one more year, and the repair adds another year, making it two. Or perhaps it's better to think that the customer's current tires are in their third year, and without repair, they would last one more year (total four years), but by repairing, they get an extra year beyond that. So the repair makes them last one more year beyond the original four, so five years total. Hmm, that's possible, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently. Let's assume that the current tires are being used, and when repaired, they last for one more year. So the customer has to pay $40 per tire to extend their life by a year. So the average cost per year for the repair option would be the total cost (40) divided by the number of years they get from the repair. But wait, how many years does the repair add? It says one additional year. So if the customer is currently using the tires, and the repair adds one more year, then the cost per year is 40 divided by 1? That can't be right because that would make the repair option cost $40 per year, which seems high compared to the new tire's $45. But the options don't have 45 being 12.5% higher than 40. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial lifespan of the current tires is four years, but they're already a few years old, so they have less life left. Let me think again. Let me try to model both options.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Cost: $180 per tire. Lifespan: 4 years. So average cost per year is 180 / 4 = $45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires. Cost: $40 per tire. Lifespan: the current tires plus one more year. So how many years does the repair add? It says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So if the current tires are, for example, three years old, and have one year left, then repair adds one more year, making them last two more years. Or perhaps the current tires have one year left, and the repair adds one year, making it two years. Wait, but the problem says when new, they last four years. So perhaps the customer is considering repairing their current tires, which have three years of life left. Or maybe the current tires are in their third year and have one year left, so the repair makes them last an additional year, making it two years total after repair. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the current tires are in their first year, and the repair adds one year, making them last two years. But without knowing the current age, perhaps the problem is intended to assume that the current tires would last one year without repair, and the repair adds another year, making it two years. Or perhaps the current tires have already lasted three years and would last one more without repair, making four years total. Then the repair adds one more year, making it five. Wait, but the problem says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So perhaps the current tires are about to last one more year, and the repair extends that to two years. Or maybe the current tires have some life left, and the repair adds one more year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the current tires are about to last one more year, and the repair extends that by one, making two years. So the cost per year for the repair would be 40 divided by 2, which is $20 per year. Let me see. If that's the case, then the new tire's average cost per year is $45, and the repair's is $20. Then the question is, what's the percentage increase from 20 to 45.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\" So we're comparing the new tire's average cost to the repair's average cost. So if repair is $20 per year and new is $45, then 45 is how much percent higher than 20.\n\nWait, let's calculate that. The increase is 45 - 20 = 25. Then, as a percentage of the repair cost, it's (25/20)*100 = 125% increase. But that's not one of the options. Hmm, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires, without repair, would have lasted three years, and the repair makes them last four years. So the average cost per year for the repair would be 40 divided by 4, which is $10 per year. Then the new tires are $45 per year, which is 35 higher than 10. So 35/10 is 3.5, which is 350% increase. That's way higher than the options. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are about to last one more year, so the repair makes them last two years. So the cost per year for the repair is 40 / 2 = $20. Then the new tires are $45 per year, which is 25 more than 20. 25 / 20 = 1.25, which is 125% increase. Again, not matching the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires, without repair, would last four years, and the repair adds one more year, making five. So the average cost per year for repair would be 40 /5 = $8. Then the new tires are $45 per year, which is 37 more. 37/8 is 4.625, which is 462.5% increase. That's way too high. Not in the options.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again. The problem states that the customer can choose to repair their current tires for $40 each, which will make them last one additional year. So perhaps the current tires have some life left beyond which they would have lasted without repair. Or perhaps the current tires are in their third year and have one year left. So by repairing, they get an extra year, making it four years. So the average cost per year would be 40 divided by (current life + 1). But without knowing the current life, maybe the problem is intended to model that the current tires are about to last one more year, so the repair makes them last two.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering that the current tires, when new, last four years. So the customer's current tires are four years old and are now being considered for repair. If they repair them, they get one more year, making it five. So the average cost per year for repair would be 40 /5 = $8. New tires are 180/4=45. So the difference is 45 -8 =37. So the percentage increase is (37/8)*100 = 462.5%, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are about to last one more year, so without repair, they'll last one more year, and with repair, two more. So the average cost per year is 40 /2 =20. Then new tires are 45. The percentage increase is (45-20)/20 *100 =125%. Not an option. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering that the current tires, when new, last four years, but the customer is thinking about whether to repair them now, so the current tires are, say, three years old. So without repair, they have one more year left. Repairing for $40 makes them last two more years, so total of four years. So the average cost per year is 40 divided by two years, which is $20 per year. Then new tires are $45 per year, so the increase is 45 is what percent higher than 20.\n\nSo, 45 is 25 more than 20. 25/20 = 1.25, which is 125% higher. But the options don't have 125. The options are A)8%, B)10%, C)12.5%, D)16.7%, E)25%.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the average cost per year for the repair. Let me think again. When you repair the tire for $40, you get one more year of use. So the total lifespan after repair is the current lifespan plus one year. But the problem doesn't specify how much life the current tire has. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the customer's current tires are about to fail, so without repair, they would last for zero more years. Repairing them for $40 gives them one more year. So the average cost per year is 40 /1 =40. Then new tires are 45, which is 5 more. 5/40 = 0.125, 12.5% increase. Oh, that would match option C)12.5%.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if the current tires are about to fail, then the repair gives them one more year. So the average cost per year for repair is 40/1 =40. New tires are 45, so 45 is 12.5% higher than 40. Because (45-40)/40 = 0.125, which is 12.5%.\n\nSo the answer would be C)12.5%.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about tires and costs, and I need to figure out the percentage difference in the average cost per year between buying new tires and repairing the old ones. Hmm, let me break it down.\n\nAlright, so the question says that new tires last for four years and cost $180 each. Alternatively, you can repair the current tires for $40 each, and this repair makes them last one more year. The question is asking, what's the percentage increase in the average cost per year when choosing the new tires compared to repairing.\n\nWait, I think I need to calculate the average cost per year for both options and then find out what percentage the new tires' average cost is higher than the repaired ones.\n\nLet me start with the new tires. Each tire costs $180 and lasts four years. So the average cost per year for one tire would be the total cost divided by the number of years. That would be 180 divided by 4, right? So 180 / 4 equals 45. So each year, the cost is $45 on average.\n\nNow the repair option. The customer already has tires, and by repairing for $40, they get an extra year. So if the original tires were going to last, say, three years (since without repair, the problem says when purchased new they last four, but the current ones presumably are older? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The problem states that when new, tires last four years. But the customer already has some tires, and can choose to repair them for $40, making them last one more year. So let me think: if the customer's current tires are, say, three years old, and they repair them for $40, they get an extra year. Or maybe the current tires are in their third year, so adding one year would make it four. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify how old the current tires are. Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me re-read the problem.\n\nThe problem says: tires when purchased new last for four years. So a new tire is good for four years. The customer can either buy new tires at $180 each, which will last four years, or repair their current tires for $40 each, which will make the current tires last one additional year.\n\nWait, so the current tires, without repair, would last, perhaps, three more years? Or perhaps they're one year old? No, the problem doesn't specify. Hmm, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Because when you repair, you get one additional year. So if the current tires would have lasted, say, X years, repair makes them last X+1 years. But without knowing X, perhaps the question is assuming that the current tires are being considered for repair now, so that the repair gives them one more year beyond their current lifespan. Alternatively, perhaps the current tires are already one year old, and repair would make them last another three, but that's not clear.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the current tires as being at the point where they can be repaired for one more year. Let me think differently. Maybe the current tires, without repair, would last three years (since the new ones last four, but these are used). So when you repair them for $40, they last an additional year, making it four years total. Alternatively, perhaps the current tires are about to fail, so without repair, they would only last one more year, and with repair, they last two more years. But without knowing, perhaps the problem is assuming that the current tires are about to last one more year, and the repair adds another year, making it two. Or perhaps it's better to think that the customer's current tires are in their third year, and without repair, they would last one more year (total four years), but by repairing, they get an extra year beyond that. So the repair makes them last one more year beyond the original four, so five years total. Hmm, that's possible, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently. Let's assume that the current tires are being used, and when repaired, they last for one more year. So the customer has to pay $40 per tire to extend their life by a year. So the average cost per year for the repair option would be the total cost (40) divided by the number of years they get from the repair. But wait, how many years does the repair add? It says one additional year. So if the customer is currently using the tires, and the repair adds one more year, then the cost per year is 40 divided by 1? That can't be right because that would make the repair option cost $40 per year, which seems high compared to the new tire's $45. But the options don't have 45 being 12.5% higher than 40. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial lifespan of the current tires is four years, but they're already a few years old, so they have less life left. Let me think again. Let me try to model both options.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Cost: $180 per tire. Lifespan: 4 years. So average cost per year is 180 / 4 = $45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires. Cost: $40 per tire. Lifespan: the current tires plus one more year. So how many years does the repair add? It says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So if the current tires are, for example, three years old, and have one year left, then repair adds one more year, making them last two more years. Or perhaps the current tires have one year left, and the repair adds one year, making it two years. Wait, but the problem says when new, they last four years. So perhaps the customer is considering repairing their current tires, which have three years of life left. Or maybe the current tires are in their third year and have one year left, so the repair makes them last an additional year, making it two years total after repair. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the current tires are in their first year, and the repair adds one year, making them last two years. But without knowing the current age, perhaps the problem is intended to assume that the current tires would last one year without repair, and the repair adds another year, making it two years. Or perhaps the current tires have already lasted three years and would last one more without repair, making four years total. Then the repair adds one more year, making it five. Wait, but the problem says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So perhaps the current tires are about to last one more year, and the repair extends that to two years. Or maybe the current tires have some life left, and the repair adds one more year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the current tires are about to last one more year, and the repair extends that by one, making two years. So the cost per year for the repair would be 40 divided by 2, which is $20 per year. Let me see. If that's the case, then the new tire's average cost per year is $45, and the repair's is $20. Then the question is, what's the percentage increase from 20 to 45.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\" So we're comparing the new tire's average cost to the repair's average cost. So if repair is $20 per year and new is $45, then 45 is how much percent higher than 20.\n\nWait, let's calculate that. The increase is 45 - 20 = 25. Then, as a percentage of the repair cost, it's (25/20)*100 = 125% increase. But that's not one of the options. Hmm, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires, without repair, would have lasted three years, and the repair makes them last four years. So the average cost per year for the repair would be 40 divided by 4, which is $10 per year. Then the new tires are $45 per year, which is 35 higher than 10. So 35/10 is 3.5, which is 350% increase. That's way higher than the options. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are about to last one more year, so the repair makes them last two years. So the cost per year for the repair is 40 / 2 = $20. Then the new tires are $45 per year, which is 25 more than 20. 25 / 20 = 1.25, which is 125% increase. Again, not matching the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires, without repair, would last four years, and the repair adds one more year, making five. So the average cost per year for repair would be 40 /5 = $8. Then the new tires are $45 per year, which is 37 more. 37/8 is 4.625, which is 462.5% increase. That's way too high. Not in the options.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again. The problem states that the customer can choose to repair their current tires for $40 each, which will make them last one additional year. So perhaps the current tires have some life left beyond which they would have lasted without repair. Or perhaps the current tires are in their third year and have one year left. So by repairing, they get an extra year, making it four years. So the average cost per year would be 40 divided by (current life + 1). But without knowing the current life, maybe the problem is intended to model that the current tires are about to last one more year, so the repair makes them last two.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering that the current tires, when new, last four years. So the customer's current tires are four years old and are now being considered for repair. If they repair them, they get one more year, making it five. So the average cost per year for repair would be 40 /5 = $8. New tires are 180/4=45. So the difference is 45 -8 =37. So the percentage increase is (37/8)*100 = 462.5%, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are about to last one more year, so without repair, they'll last one more year, and with repair, two more. So the average cost per year is 40 /2 =20. Then new tires are 45. The percentage increase is (45-20)/20 *100 =125%. Not an option. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering that the current tires, when new, last four years, but the customer is thinking about whether to repair them now, so the current tires are, say, three years old. So without repair, they have one more year left. Repairing for $40 makes them last two more years, so total of four years. So the average cost per year is 40 divided by two years, which is $20 per year. Then new tires are $45 per year, so the increase is 45 is what percent higher than 20.\n\nSo, 45 is 25 more than 20. 25/20 = 1.25, which is 125% higher. But the options don't have 125. The options are A)8%, B)10%, C)12.5%, D)16.7%, E)25%.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the average cost per year for the repair. Let me think again. When you repair the tire for $40, you get one more year of use. So the total lifespan after repair is the current lifespan plus one year. But the problem doesn't specify how much life the current tire has. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the customer's current tires are about to fail, so without repair, they would last for zero more years. Repairing them for $40 gives them one more year. So the average cost per year is 40 /1 =40. Then new tires are 45, which is 5 more. 5/40 = 0.125, 12.5% increase. Oh, that would match option C)12.5%.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if the current tires are about to fail, then the repair gives them one more year. So the average cost per year for repair is 40/1 =40. New tires are 45, so 45 is 12.5% higher than 40. Because (45-40)/40 = 0.125, which is 12.5%.\n\nSo the answer would be C)12.5%.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage increase in the average cost per year of new tires compared to repairing the current tires, we analyze both options:\n\n### Option 1: New Tires\n- **Cost**: $180 per tire  \n- **Lifespan**: 4 years  \n- **Average cost per year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{180}{4} = 45 \\, \\text{\\$/year}\n  \\]\n\n### Option 2: Repairing Current Tires\n- **Cost**: $40 per tire  \n- **Additional lifespan**: 1 year  \n- **Total lifespan after repair**: 1 year (assuming the current tires are about to fail and the repair extends their life by 1 year)  \n- **Average cost per year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{40}{1} = 40 \\, \\text{\\$/year}\n  \\]\n\n### Percentage Increase\nThe question asks for the percentage increase in the average cost per year of new tires compared to repairing the current tires.

Hmm, let me read it again.\n\nSo, the new tires cost $180 each and last four years. The customer can either buy new ones or repair the existing ones for $40 each, which adds one more year to their life. The question is asking by what percentage the average cost per year of new tires is greater than the repair option.\n\nWait, so I need to find the average cost per year for both options and then see what percent the new tire cost is higher than the repair cost.\n\nLet me break it down. For the new tires, each tire costs $180 and lasts four years. So the average cost per year would be 180 divided by 4. Let me calculate that: 180 / 4 = 45. So that's $45 per year.\n\nNow for the repair option. The repair costs $40 per tire and extends the life by one year. Hmm, wait. So the current tires were already purchased, I think. So the customer is considering whether to repair or buy new. But I'm not sure if the original cost of the tires is part of the equation. Wait, no, the problem is about the average cost per year when choosing to repair versus buying new. So I think we're only considering the cost of repair versus the cost of new tires.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when you repair, you pay $40, and it makes the current tires last one more year. So let's say the current tires are already x years old. But the problem says when purchased new, they last four years. So perhaps the customer's current tires are, for example, three years old, and they can choose to repair them for one more year, making the total lifespan four years. But in terms of cost, the new tires would cost 180 each, but the repair is 40 each and adds one year.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is abstracting away the initial cost of the current tires because the question is about the average cost per year of the new tires versus the repair. So maybe the average cost is just the cost of the repair divided by the additional year.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The customer has current tires. They can either buy new tires for $180 each, which will last four years, or they can repair the current tires for $40 each, which will make the current tires last one more year. So if they repair, the tires will last for an additional year beyond their current life.\n\nWait, but the problem states that when purchased new, the tires last four years. So perhaps the current tires are already in their third year or something, but the problem isn't giving specific information about how long they've been used. So maybe the problem is simplifying it, considering the repair option as adding one year to the current lifespan, regardless of how long they've been used. So perhaps the initial purchase is four years, and the repair adds another year.\n\nWait, no. Let me read the problem again. It says, \"when purchased new, last for four years.\" So when new, they last four years. So if the customer has the current tires, perhaps they've been used for some time. But the repair extends their life by one year. So the total lifespan after repair is four years.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are already three years old, and repairing them will make them last one more year, so the total four years. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the repair extends the current lifespan by one year, making it five years total? No, the problem says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So if they were going to last three years without repair, they'll last four. But the problem states that when new, they last four years. So perhaps the current tires are still within that four-year period, and the repair is adding another year beyond that? Or maybe the current tires have been used for some time, and the repair adds one more year to their lifespan.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is comparing two options: buying new tires that last four years, or repairing the current tires for $40 each, which adds one year to their life.

So the answer should be C.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage by which the average cost per year of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires, we calculate the average cost per year for both options:\n\n1. **New Tires**:  \n   The cost of new tires is $180, and they last for 4 years.  \n   Average cost per year = $\\frac{180}{4} = 45$ dollars.\n\n2. **Repair Option**:  \n   Repairing the current tires costs $40, and it extends their lifespan by 1 additional year.  \n   Average cost per year = $\\frac{40}{1} = 40$ dollars.\n\nNext, we calculate the percentage increase in the average cost per year of new tires compared to the repair option:  \nDifference in cost = $45 - 40 = 5$ dollars.  \nPercentage increase = $\\frac{5}{40} \\times 100\\% = 12.5\\%$.\n\nThus, the average cost per year of new tires is 12.5% greater than the cost of repairing the current tires.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about tires and costs. Let me try to break it down. I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nThe question is about calculating the average cost per year for new tires versus repairing the current ones. Then, we need to find out what percentage greater the new tires' cost is compared to the repaired ones.\n\nHmm. Let me read it again. So, when you buy new tires, they last four years. Each new tire costs $180. Alternatively, you can repair the current tires for $40 each, and this repair makes them last one extra year.\n\nWait, so the original tires are probably already a certain age. But the problem doesn't specify how old they are when deciding to repair. Hmm, maybe it's not about how old they are, but just the cost over their extended life.\n\nWait, the question is about the average cost per year for each option. So I need to calculate the cost per year for both purchasing new tires and repairing the current ones.\n\nLet me think. Let's start with the new tires. If each tire costs $180 and lasts four years, then the average cost per year would be total cost divided by the number of years. So 180 divided by 4. Let me calculate that: 180 /4 = 45. So new tires cost $45 per year.\n\nNow the repair option. The customer can repair their current tires for $40 each, which extends their life by one year. Wait, does that mean the tires are already in use for some time, or is it just adding one year to their current lifespan?\n\nWait, the problem says, when purchased new, they last four years. So if the current tires are not new, maybe they have some life left. But perhaps the problem is considering the current tires as being at a point where you can repair them to add an extra year, making their total lifespan longer. Or perhaps it's considering that the repair gives one more year beyond what they would have otherwise.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires would last a certain number of years, but without repair, maybe they have one year left, and repair adds another year. Hmm, but the problem says that the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So, if you repair them, they last one more year beyond their current lifespan.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify how long the current tires have been used. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should assume that the current tires have already been used for some time and that the repair adds one more year. But since the problem is comparing the average cost per year, perhaps I need to look at the total lifespan each option provides.\n\nWait, perhaps for the repair option, each repair costs $40 per tire and gives one more year. So, the customer can choose to either buy new tires now, which cost $180 each and last four years, or repair their current tires for $40 each, getting one more year.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\" So if the current tires have been used for some time, perhaps they have, say, three years of life left, and the repair adds one more year, making it four. Or maybe they're just adding one year regardless of their current state.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is: If you choose to repair, you pay $40 and get one more year. But how many times can you repair? The problem doesn't specify, so maybe each repair is a one-time thing, adding one year. So, for example, you can choose to repair once, paying $40, to get one more year. Or perhaps you can repair multiple times, each adding a year.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the current tires can be repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\" So perhaps each repair adds one year, but maybe you can do multiple repairs. But since the question is about the average cost per year, perhaps we need to model the cost per year for each option, considering how many years each option provides.\n\nWait, but the problem is comparing the average cost per year of the new tires to the cost of repairing. So perhaps for each option, we calculate the total cost and divide by the total lifespan, then compare the two average costs.\n\nWait, let's think. The new tires cost $180 each and last four years. So average cost per year is 180 /4 = $45.\n\nThe repair option: the customer is choosing to repair their current tires. So how much does that cost and how many years does it last? Let's see. The repair is $40 per tire, and it makes the current tires last for one additional year. So perhaps without repair, the current tires would last, say, three years? Or maybe the repair adds one year, making the total lifespan, say, four years if they were about to fail.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should model both options as if they're providing a certain number of years.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer can choose between:\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires now, which will last four years. So the cost is $180, and they get four years.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires for $40, which will make them last one more year beyond their current lifespan. But how long were they going to last before the repair? The problem says when purchased new, they last four years, but the current tires might have been purchased a while ago. But without knowing their current age, perhaps we can assume that the current tires have already been used for some time, and the repair adds one year.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering the current tires as being in their fourth year, so they have one year left. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the repair adds one year regardless of their current state, so the current tires would last one more year after repair.\n\nHmm, perhaps the way to approach this is to model the cost per year for each option, considering the number of years they last.\n\nWait, for the new tires, it's straightforward: $180 for four years, so $45 per year.\n\nFor the repair option: Suppose the customer repairs the current tires for $40, which gives one additional year. But how long were they going to last before the repair? If they were about to last for 'n' more years, the repair adds one, making it 'n+1' years. But without knowing 'n', perhaps the problem is assuming that the current tires have already been used for three years, so they have one year left, and the repair adds another year, making their total lifespan four years. But that would make the cost $40 for four years, which would be $10 per year. Then the average cost per year for new tires is $45, repair is $10. But that would make the new tires 350% more expensive, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering that the current tires are in their first year, and the repair extends their lifespan by one year, making them last two years. So the cost is $40 for two years, so average cost per year would be $20. Then the new tires are $45 per year, which would be 125% higher. But that's also not an option.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe customer can choose to buy new tires for $180 each, which last four years. Or repair the current tires for $40 each, making them last one additional year.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are already one year old, and without repair, they have three years left. Repairing adds one year, making them last four years. So the cost is $40, and the lifespan is four years.\n\nWait, no, if the current tires are already one year old, and without repair, they have three years left, then with repair, they would last four years. So the total lifespan after repair is four years, but the cost is $40. So the average cost per year would be 40/4 = $10 per year.\n\nComparing that to new tires' $45 per year, the new tires are more expensive. So the question is, how much percent greater is 45 than 10.\n\nWait, let's calculate that. The difference is 45 -10=35. So 35 is what percentage of 10? (35/10)*100 = 350%. But that's not one of the options.\n\nHmm, that can't be right. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the repair's effect. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So if the current tires have been used for some time, maybe they have x years left. The repair makes them last x+1 years. But without knowing x, perhaps the problem is treating the current tires as if they have zero years left, and the repair gives them one year. But that doesn't make sense because then the repair is just one year, and the cost is $40 for one year, which is $40 per year.\n\nSo new tires are $45 per year, which is 12.5% higher than $40. Because 45 is 12.5% more than 40? Wait, no. Wait, 40 plus 12.5% is 45. Because 12.5% of 40 is 5, so 40+5=45. So the new tires are 12.5% more expensive per year than repairing. But the question is, \"the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\"\n\nSo if new tires are $45 per year, and repair is $40 per year, then 45 is 12.5% higher than 40. So the answer would be 12.5%, which is option C.\n\nWait, but how did I get the repair cost per year as $40? Because the repair is $40 per tire for one additional year. So each repair gives one year. So if the customer chooses to repair, they pay $40 for one more year. So the cost per year is 40 dollars for that one year. But wait, is that the case? Or does the repair add a year to the current tires, which have some remaining lifespan.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nLet me model both options.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Cost: $180. Lifespan: 4 years. So average cost per year: 180 /4 = 45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires. Cost: $40. Lifespan: 1 additional year.\n\nWait, but if the current tires are already being used, and you pay $40 to get one more year, then the total lifespan is the current lifespan plus one. But the problem says when purchased new, they last four years. So if the current tires have been used for, say, three years, then without repair, they would last one more year. With repair, they last two more years.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering that the repair adds one year beyond the current lifespan. So for example, if the current tires have been used for three years, they have one year left. Repair adds one, making it two years. So the total lifespan after repair is four years (3 + 1 + 1?), but I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply saying that each repair adds one year, regardless of the current state, and each repair costs $40. But how many times can you repair? The problem doesn't specify, so perhaps it's a one-time repair, giving one extra year. So the customer can choose to repair once for $40, getting one more year.\n\nWait, that would mean that the current tires, without repair, have some lifespan, but with repair, they last longer. But without knowing the initial lifespan, perhaps the problem is considering that the current tires have zero years left and the repair gives one year. So the cost is $40 for one year, which is $40 per year.\n\nBut then, the average cost for new tires is $45 per year, which is 12.5% higher than $40. So the percentage would be 12.5%, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should think about it another way. Maybe the customer is considering whether to buy new tires now (cost $180, 4 years) or repair their current tires for $40, which would make them last one more year beyond their current lifespan. So perhaps the current tires have been in use for a certain period, say, x years. Without repair, they would last (4 - x) years. With repair, they last (4 - x) + 1 = (5 -x) years.\n\nBut without knowing x, maybe the problem is assuming that the current tires have been used for three years, so without repair, they have one year left, and with repair, two years. So the cost would be $40 for two years, which averages to $20 per year.\n\nWait, but that would make the average cost per year of repair $20, and new tires are $45, which is 125% higher. But that's not one of the options.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem says that the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So perhaps the total lifespan after repair is one year. But that can't be right because then the customer would have to buy new tires after that.\n\nWait, maybe the repair is an alternative to buying new. So the customer is choosing between:\n\n- Pay $180 now, get four years of use.\n\n- Pay $40 now, get one additional year of use.\n\nIn that case, the average cost per year for each option is:\n\nNew tires: 180 /4 =45.\n\nRepair: 40 /1=40.\n\nSo the new tires cost 45, repair is 40. The percentage increase from repair to new is (45-40)/40 *100 = (5/40)*100=12.5%.\n\nSo the answer would be C)12.5%.\n\nBut wait, another way to think: perhaps the customer is considering whether to repair multiple times. Like, if each repair gives one year for $40, perhaps they can repair each time to keep extending the tire's life. But the problem says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year, so maybe it's a one-time repair. So the customer has to decide between buying new tires for four years or repairing once for one year.\n\nBut that would make the repair option only give one year of use, which seems impractical. So perhaps the correct approach is that the repair gives an additional year, so the total lifespan is one year. But that doesn't make sense for the average cost.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is comparing the two options over the same number of years. Let's say, for four years, how much would each option cost?\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Cost $180, lasts four years. So average is 45 per year.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires each year to keep getting an extra year. So each year, you pay $40 to get one more year. So for four years, you'd have to repair three times (because the first repair gives you the first year, then each repair gives you the next). Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe you can only repair once, adding one year, so the total lifespan is five years (original four plus one more?), but that seems unclear.\n\nI think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to model it differently.\n\nAssume the customer is looking to have tires for a certain number of years, say N years. They can choose between:\n\n1. Buy new tires now for $180, which last four years. So if N is four, cost is 180.\n\n2. Repair their current tires for $40, which gives one more year. So if they choose repair, their tires last one more year beyond their current lifespan.\n\nWait, but without knowing the current lifespan, perhaps it's better to model the average cost per year for each option, assuming that each option provides a certain number of years.\n\nIf the customer chooses new tires, they pay 180 for four years. So per year, 45.\n\nIf the customer chooses repair, they pay 40 for one additional year. So per year, 40.\n\nThus, the new tires are 45, repair is 40. The difference is 5. So 5/40 is 0.125, which is 12.5% higher.\n\nSo the answer is C)12.5%.\n",

With repair, they last (4 - x) + 1 = (5 -x) years.\n\nBut without knowing x, maybe the problem is assuming that the current tires have been used for three years, so without repair, they have one year left, and with repair, two years. So the cost would be $40 for two years, which averages to $20 per year.\n\nWait, but that would make the average cost per year of repair $20, and new tires are $45, which is 125% higher. But that's not one of the options.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem says that the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So perhaps the total lifespan after repair is one year. But that can't be right because then the customer would have to buy new tires after that.\n\nWait, maybe the repair is an alternative to buying new. So the customer is choosing between:\n\n- Pay $180 now, get four years of use.\n\n- Pay $40 now, get one additional year of use.\n\nIn that case, the average cost per year for each option is:\n\nNew tires: 180 /4 =45.\n\nRepair: 40 /1=40.\n\nSo the new tires cost 45, repair is 40. The percentage increase from repair to new is (45-40)/40 *100 = (5/40)*100=12.5%.\n\nSo the answer would be C)12.5%.\n\nBut wait, another way to think: perhaps the customer is considering whether to repair multiple times. Like, if each repair gives one year for $40, perhaps they can repair each time to keep extending the tire's life. But the problem says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year, so maybe it's a one-time repair. So the customer has to decide between buying new tires for four years or repairing once for one year.\n\nBut that would make the repair option only give one year of use, which seems impractical. So perhaps the correct approach is that the repair gives an additional year, so the total lifespan is one year. But that doesn't make sense for the average cost.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is comparing the two options over the same number of years. Let's say, for four years, how much would each option cost?\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Cost $180, lasts four years. So average is 45 per year.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires each year to keep getting an extra year. So each year, you pay $40 to get one more year. So for four years, you'd have to repair three times (because the first repair gives you the first year, then each repair gives you the next). Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe you can only repair once, adding one year, so the total lifespan is five years (original four plus one more?), but that seems unclear.\n\nI think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to model it differently.\n\nAssume the customer is looking to have tires for a certain number of years, say N years. They can choose between:\n\n1. Buy new tires now for $180, which last four years. So if N is four, cost is 180.\n\n2. Repair their current tires for $40, which gives one more year. So if they choose repair, their tires last one more year beyond their current lifespan.\n\nWait, but without knowing the current lifespan, perhaps it's better to model the average cost per year for each option, assuming that each option provides a certain number of years.\n\nIf the customer chooses new tires, they pay 180 for four years. So per year, 45.\n\nIf the customer chooses repair, they pay 40 for one additional year. So per year, 40.\n\nThus, the new tires are 45, repair is 40. The difference is 5. So 5/40 is 0.125, which is 12.5% higher.\n\nSo the answer is C)12.5%.\n\n\nTo determine the average cost per year of the new tires compared to repairing the current tires, we analyze both options:\n\n### Option 1: New Tires\n- **Cost**: $180 per tire.\n- **Lifespan**: 4 years.\n- **Average Cost per Year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{180}{4} = 45 \\, \\text{dollars per year}.\n  \\]\n\n### Option 2: Repairing Current Tires\n- **Cost**: $40 per tire.\n- **Additional Lifespan**: 1 year.\n- **Average Cost per Year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{40}{1} = 40 \\, \\text{dollars per year}.\n  \\]\n\n### Comparison\nThe average cost per year of new tires is $45, and the average cost per year of repairing the current tires is $40. To find the percentage by which the new tires' cost is greater than the repair cost:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{45 - 40}{40} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{5}{40} \\right) \\times 100 = 12.5\\%.\n\\]\n\nThus, the average cost per year of the new tires is **12.5% greater** than the cost of repairing the current tires.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about tire costs and figuring out the percentage difference. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nAlright, the question says that new tires last for four years and cost $180 each. Alternatively, you can repair the current tires for $40 each, and that repair makes them last one more year. So, the customer is trying to decide whether to buy new tires or repair the old ones, and we need to compare the average cost per year for each option.\n\nWait, the main thing is to find out the average cost per year for both options and then see what percentage the new tires' cost is higher than the repair cost. Right.\n\nLet's start with the new tires. Each tire costs $180 and lasts four years. So, the average cost per year would be the total cost divided by the number of years. That's $180 divided by 4. Let me calculate that: 180 /4 is 45. So, $45 per year per tire.\n\nNow, for the repair option. The current tires are being repaired for $40 each, and this makes them last one additional year. Wait, I need to clarify: does the repair extend the life to one more year beyond their original lifespan, or does it just add one year in total? The question says, \"make the current tires last for one additional year.\" Oh, I think that means the tires were already in use, so they probably have some life left. Wait, maybe I should think about it differently.\n\nWait, the problem says the new tires last for four years. So, the customer's current tires are presumably at the end of their four years, right? Because they're considering replacing them or repairing them. So, if they repair them, they'll last one more year. So, the current tires have already been used for four years, but with a repair, they last an extra year, making it five years total? Or wait, maybe the repair adds one year to their current lifespan. Hmm, perhaps I need to think of it as the current tires can be repaired for $40 each, which adds one year to their life. So, if the customer's current tires are, say, three years old, repairing them would make them last one more year (total four years from purchase?), but I think the problem is more straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial tire's lifespan is four years. So, when the customer buys them new, they last four years. Now, if they repair them, each repair costs $40 and makes the current tires last one additional year. So, how many years does each tire last after repair? Let's think.\n\nSuppose the customer is at the point where the tires are nearing the end of their four-year lifespan. If they repair, the tires last one more year. So, the lifespan becomes five years? Or does the repair add one year to the remaining life? Hmm, maybe the problem is that the customer can choose between buying new tires (which last four years) or repairing the current ones, which adds one more year to their life.\n\nWait, the problem states, \"tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years.\" So, if the customer already has these tires, and they've been used for, say, four years, and now they can choose to buy new ones or repair the old ones. Repairing the old ones would make them last one more year, so the total lifespan would be four plus one, which is five years. Or wait, maybe the repair adds one year regardless of the current state.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer is considering whether to replace the tires now, or to repair them and get an extra year. So, the repair adds one year to the current tires, which are already four years old. So, the total lifespan becomes five years. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me re-read the problem.\n\n\"A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\"\n\nAh, so the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So, the current tires, without repair, would last how long? Wait, the problem says when purchased new, they last four years. So, the customer's current tires are probably the original ones, which are now, perhaps, nearing the end of their four-year lifespan. If he repairs them, they last one more year beyond that, so the total lifespan becomes five years. Or maybe the repair is an option each year, but I think in this case, the customer is at a point where they have to choose between buying new or repairing once.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the repair adds one year to the current tires. So, if the tires are currently, say, 3 years old, repairing would make them last one more year (total 4 years from repair), but that doesn't quite fit. Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering the cost per year for each option, assuming that the customer will use the tires for a certain number of years.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model it as: when you buy new tires, you get four years of use per tire at $180. When you repair, you pay $40, and get one additional year. But wait, that's not clear. Wait, perhaps the repair is for the current tires, which are already four years old. So, if you repair them, they last one more year, making them last a total of five years.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck on the lifespan part. Let's try a different approach. Let's assume that the customer is considering whether to buy new tires or repair the current ones. The new tires cost $180 and last four years. The repair costs $40 and gives one more year. So, the total lifespan for the repair option is four (original) + one (additional) = five years? Or is the repair an option that can be done each year to extend the life by a year each time? Probably not, because the problem states the repair makes them last for one additional year, which suggests a one-time repair.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are already in use and are about to fail. So, if the customer repairs them, they can get one more year. So, the total lifespan is four years from purchase (original) plus one more year (with repair), making it five years. Or perhaps, the current tires have been used for, say, three years, and repairing them will make them last one more year (total four years from purchase, same as new tires). Hmm, but the problem states that the repair makes them last for one additional year, so perhaps the repair extends the lifespan beyond the original four years.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the customer is at the point where the tires are four years old, and if they repair, the tires will last one more year (total five years). But I'm not entirely certain. Maybe the problem is simply that the repair allows the current tires to last one more year beyond their original lifespan.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the average cost per year for each option. So, for the new tires, it's four years per tire at $180, so $45 per year. For the repair, the customer pays $40 and gets one more year of use. So, if the original tires were going to last four years, the repair gives them an extra year, making the total five years. Or perhaps the repair is done on the current tires, which are perhaps already in their fourth year, and the repair makes them last one more year, so the total lifespan is five years.\n\nWait, maybe that's overcomplicating it. Let's think about the cost per year for each option.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Each tire costs $180 and lasts 4 years. So, the average cost per year is 180/4 = $45.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires. The repair costs $40 and extends their lifespan by one year. But wait, how many years are we considering for the repair option? If the current tires are already four years old, and the repair gives them one more year, then the total lifespan is five years for that tire. So, the cost is $40 for five years. Alternatively, maybe the repair is for the current tires, which were already in use for four years, and the repair gives them one more year. So, the total time is five years, but the cost is $40 for that extra year.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model both options as the cost per year for the same period. Let's say the customer is considering the next year. If they buy new tires, they'll have four years of use at $180. If they repair, they'll have one more year of use at $40.\n\nWait, that might not be the right approach. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem is to find the average cost per year for each option, and then find the percentage that the new tire cost is higher than the repair cost.\n\nFor new tires: $180 for four years. So, 180/4 = $45/year.\n\nFor repair: $40 for an additional year. So, if the current tires are already four years old, the repair gives one more year, making it five years total. So, the cost is $40 for five years. So, 40/5 = $8 per year.\n\nWait, wait, no. Because the customer is choosing between buying new tires (cost $180, lasts four years) or repairing the current tires (cost $40, lasts one more year). So, perhaps the repair is an option that, when done, extends the current tires' life by one year. So, the current tires, if repaired, will last one more year beyond their original four, making it five years.\n\nBut in that case, the average cost per year for the repair option would be the total cost (40) spread over the five years. So, 40/5 = 8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the customer is considering whether to replace the tires now or repair them now. Let's say the current tires are four years old. If the customer buys new tires, they'll have four years of use. If they repair, the tires will last one more year, so they get one more year of use.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify the current age of the tires. It just says the customer can choose between purchasing new or repairing the current ones. So perhaps the current tires are already four years old, and repairing them would make them last one more year. So, for the repair option, the customer pays $40, and gets one year of use. So, the average cost per year would be 40/1 = $40 per year.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the new tires are $45 per year. So, 45 vs 40, which would make the new tires 12.5% more expensive. Hmm, but let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are already in use for, say, three years, and the customer is deciding whether to buy new tires (four years) or repair them for an extra year. So, if he repairs, the tires will last one more year (total four years). So, the cost is $40 for four years, so 40/4 = $10 per year. Then the new tires are $45 per year. The difference is $5. So, 5/10 is 50% increase, which isn't one of the options. Hmm, that can't be right.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach this systematically.\n\nThe problem is to compute the average cost per year for each option.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Each tire costs $180, lasts 4 years. So, average cost per year is 180 /4 = $45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires. Each repair costs $40, and it makes the current tires last for one additional year. So, how many years are we talking about here? Let's think about the customer's situation. The customer's current tires are presumably at the end of their useful life. So, if they don't repair, the tires will last four years. Wait, no, the tires are already purchased and are currently in use. So, when the customer buys new tires, they last four years. So, perhaps the customer's current tires have been used for four years and are about to fail. So, if they repair them, they get one more year. So, the lifespan becomes five years.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because if the tires are already four years old, and the customer repairs them, they get one more year. So, the total lifespan is five years. So, the cost is $40 for five years. So, average cost per year is 40/5 = $8.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the new tire's average cost is $45, which is way higher than $8. So, the new tires would be way more expensive, but the options don't have a 45/8 *100% which is 562.5%. That's not one of the options either.\n\nHmm, that can't be right. Maybe I'm miscalculating the lifespan for the repair option. Let me think again. Maybe the repair isn't adding one year to the end of the lifespan but is an alternative to buying new. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is an option that can be done each year to extend the tire's life by one year each time. But the problem says, \"a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\" So, perhaps each repair adds one year. So, if the customer is at year four, they can choose to repair for $40, which gives them one more year (year five), and then they can repair again for another $40, getting year six, etc. But that's not what the problem says. The problem says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So, perhaps it's a one-time repair that adds one year.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are already four years old, and the repair makes them last one more year, so total five years. So, the customer pays $40, and the tires last for one more year (year five). So, the average cost per year would be 40 /1 = $40 for that one year. But the new tires are $45 per year. So, the new tires are 5 more per year. To find the percentage increase: (45-40)/40 = 5/40 = 0.125, which is 12.5%. So, the new tires are 12.5% more expensive per year than repairing.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense because the repair is only for one year, but the new tires last four years. Hmm, perhaps I'm not considering the correct time frame.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the average cost per year for the entire lifespan. So, if the customer buys new tires, they spend $180 for four years, so 45 per year. If they repair the current tires, which are already four years old, for $40, they get one more year, so that's 40 for one year, which is 40 per year. So, the new tires cost 45 per year, repair is 40 per year.\n\nSo, the new tires are 45/40 = 1.125 times the repair cost, which is a 12.5% increase. That would make the answer option C)12.5%.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nWait, another approach: the customer is deciding whether to buy new tires or repair the current ones. The current tires are about to fail, so the repair gives one more year of use. So, the repair option is to pay $40 and get one year. The new tires are $180 and last four years.\n\nSo, for the repair, the average cost per year is 40 /1 = $40. For new, it's 180/4 = $45. So, 45 is 12.5% higher than 40. Because (45-40)/40 = 0.125 = 12.5%.\n\nThat makes sense. So, the answer would be C)12.5%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is done when the tires are nearing the end of their four years, so the repair gives one more year beyond the original four. So, the total lifespan is five years. So, the cost is $40 for five years, which is 40/5 = $8 per year. Then new tires are 45 per year, which is 45/8 = 5.625, which is a 462.5% increase. But that's not an option.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So, if the current tires are already four years old, the repair makes them last one more year (so five years total). So, the average cost per year is 40 /5 = $8. But then the new tire's average cost is 45, which is 45/8 = 5.625, so 455% higher. That can't be right because the options don't have that.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the repair. Maybe the repair is done before the tires are four years old. For example, the customer's tires are three years old, and repairing them makes them last one more year, so total four years. So, the repair cost is $40, and the tires last four years. So, average cost per year is 40/4 = $10.\n\nThen, new tires are 180/4 = $45. So, the new tires are 45 vs 10. 45/10 = 4.5 times, which is a 350% increase. But again, that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair is done each year. Like, each year you can choose to repair for $40, which extends the life by a year. So, for example, if you have a tire that's one year old, you pay $40 to make it last another year (two years total). Then again at year two, pay another $40 to make it last another year (three years), etc. But that's not what the problem says. It says \"a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\" So, it's a one-time repair, not an ongoing thing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is an alternative to buying new tires. So, when the tires are four years old, you can either buy new ones for $180, which will last another four years, or repair for $40, which will make the current tires last one more year. So, comparing the two options for the same period. Wait, but that would be a different scenario.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer is considering the next four years. If they buy new tires, they'll cost $180 for four years, so $45 per year. If they repair, they pay $40, but how many years do the tires last? If they repair once, they get one more year, so the total time is five years. But the customer is considering a four-year period, so the repair would cover the next five years? That doesn't make sense.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back.\n\nThe problem asks: The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\n\nSo, I need to find (Cost_new - Cost_repair)/Cost_repair * 100.\n\nFirst, compute the average cost per year for each option.\n\nFor new tires:\nCost = $180 per tire.\nLifespan = 4 years.\nAverage cost per year = 180 /4 = $45.\n\nFor repairing:\nCost = $40 per tire.\nLifespan = 1 additional year (so total lifespan is 4 +1=5 years? Or is it just 1 year?)\n\nWait, perhaps the repair adds one year to the current tires. So, if the current tires have been used for, say, three years, the repair makes them last one more year, so total four years. So, the average cost per year is 40/4 = $10.\n\nAlternatively, if the current tires are four years old and the repair gives one more year, so the average cost is 40/5 = $8.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify the current age of the tires, just that the customer can choose between new or repair. So perhaps the repair option is for the current tires, which are four years old, and the repair adds one more year, making the total lifespan five years. So, the average cost per year is 40/5 = 8.\n\nThen, comparing new tires at 45 vs repair at 8.\n\nThe question is: the average cost of new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing?\n\nSo, (45 - 8)/8 * 100 = (37)/8 * 100 = 4.625 * 100 = 462.5%. That's way higher than any option. So that can't be right.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the repair. Maybe the repair is done when the tires are nearing the end of their four-year lifespan, so the repair gives one more year, making it five. So, the average cost is 40/5=8. But the new tires are 45, which is way higher. So, perhaps the problem is considering the repair as an alternative to buying new tires for the same period.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer is deciding whether to repair the tires now or buy new ones. So, the repair would extend the life of the current tires by one year, meaning that the total lifespan is five years for the repair option. But the new tires would last four years. So, to compare the cost per year, perhaps we need to consider the same period.\n\nWait, maybe the question is considering the cost over the same period, say four years. So, if the customer repairs the tires, how much would it cost over four years? Or perhaps not. I'm getting stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the two options in terms of cost per year.\n\nOption 1: New tires: $180 for 4 years \u2192 45/year.\n\nOption 2: Repair: $40 for 1 additional year \u2192 40/year (for that one year).\n\nSo, the repair is cheaper per year, but only for one year. The new tires give four years. So, if the customer chooses to repair, they'd have to repair each year to get the same four years, but the problem doesn't state that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is a one-time cost that extends the tire's life by one year, making it last five years. So, the cost is $40 for five years \u2192 8/year.\n\nSo, new tires cost 45/year, repair is 8/year. So, 45 is 45/8 = 5.625 times more, which is a 462.5% increase. But that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is an alternative to buying new tires. So, when the tires are about to fail after four years, the customer can repair them for $40 to last one more year, or buy new for $180 to last four years. So, the customer is choosing between four years of use for $180 or one year of use for $40.\n\nSo, in terms of cost per year:\n\nNew tires: 180/4 = 45/year.\n\nRepair: 40/1 =40/year.\n\nSo, the new tires are more expensive by 5 per year. To find the percentage increase: (45-40)/40 *100 = 12.5%.\n\nSo, the answer would be C)12.5%.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the percentage by which the average cost per year of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires, we analyze both options:\n\n### Option 1: New Tires\n- **Cost**: $180 per tire  \n- **Lifespan**: 4 years  \n- **Average cost per year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\$180}{4} = \\$45 \\text{ per year}\n  \\]\n\n### Option 2: Repairing Current Tires\n- **Cost**: $40 per tire  \n- **Additional lifespan**: 1 year  \n- **Total lifespan after repair**: 1 year (the repair extends the tire's life by 1 year, and no additional lifespan beyond that is considered in this scenario).  \n- **Average cost per year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\$40}{1} = \\$40 \\text{ per year}\n  \\]\n\n### Comparison\nThe question asks for the percentage by which the average cost per year of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires.

So, the customer is trying to decide whether to buy new tires or repair the old ones, and we need to compare the average cost per year for each option.\n\nWait, the main thing is to find out the average cost per year for both options and then see what percentage the new tires' cost is higher than the repair cost. Right.\n\nLet's start with the new tires. Each tire costs $180 and lasts four years. So, the average cost per year would be the total cost divided by the number of years. That's $180 divided by 4. Let me calculate that: 180 /4 is 45. So, $45 per year per tire.\n\nNow, for the repair option. The current tires are being repaired for $40 each, and this makes them last one additional year. Wait, I need to clarify: does the repair extend the life to one more year beyond their original lifespan, or does it just add one year in total? The question says, \"make the current tires last for one additional year.\" Oh, I think that means the tires were already in use, so they probably have some life left. Wait, maybe I should think about it differently.\n\nWait, the problem says the new tires last for four years. So, the customer's current tires are presumably at the end of their four years, right? Because they're considering replacing them or repairing them. So, if they repair them, they'll last one more year. So, the current tires have already been used for four years, but with a repair, they last an extra year, making it five years total? Or wait, maybe the repair adds one year to their current lifespan. Hmm, perhaps I need to think of it as the current tires can be repaired for $40 each, which adds one year to their life. So, if the customer's current tires are, say, three years old, repairing them would make them last one more year (total four years from purchase?), but I think the problem is more straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial tire's lifespan is four years. So, when the customer buys them new, they last four years. Now, if they repair them, each repair costs $40 and makes the current tires last one additional year. So, how many years does each tire last after repair? Let's think.\n\nSuppose the customer is at the point where the tires are nearing the end of their four-year lifespan. If they repair, the tires last one more year. So, the lifespan becomes five years? Or does the repair add one year to the remaining life? Hmm, maybe the problem is that the customer can choose between buying new tires (which last four years) or repairing the current ones, which adds one more year to their life.\n\nWait, the problem states, \"tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years.\" So, if the customer already has these tires, and they've been used for, say, four years, and now they can choose to buy new ones or repair the old ones. Repairing the old ones would make them last one more year, so the total lifespan would be four plus one, which is five years. Or wait, maybe the repair adds one year regardless of the current state.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer is considering whether to replace the tires now, or to repair them and get an extra year. So, the repair adds one year to the current tires, which are already four years old. So, the total lifespan becomes five years. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me re-read the problem.\n\n\"A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\"\n\nAh, so the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So, the current tires, without repair, would last how long? Wait, the problem says when purchased new, they last four years. So, the customer's current tires are probably the original ones, which are now, perhaps, nearing the end of their four-year lifespan. If he repairs them, they last one more year beyond that, so the total lifespan becomes five years. Or maybe the repair is an option each year, but I think in this case, the customer is at a point where they have to choose between buying new or repairing once.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the repair adds one year to the current tires. So, if the tires are currently, say, 3 years old, repairing would make them last one more year (total 4 years from repair), but that doesn't quite fit. Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering the cost per year for each option, assuming that the customer will use the tires for a certain number of years.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model it as: when you buy new tires, you get four years of use per tire at $180. When you repair, you pay $40, and get one additional year. But wait, that's not clear. Wait, perhaps the repair is for the current tires, which are already four years old. So, if you repair them, they last one more year, making them last a total of five years.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck on the lifespan part. Let's try a different approach. Let's assume that the customer is considering whether to buy new tires or repair the current ones. The new tires cost $180 and last four years. The repair costs $40 and gives one more year. So, the total lifespan for the repair option is four (original) + one (additional) = five years? Or is the repair an option that can be done each year to extend the life by a year each time? Probably not, because the problem states the repair makes them last for one additional year, which suggests a one-time repair.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are already in use and are about to fail. So, if the customer repairs them, they can get one more year. So, the total lifespan is four years from purchase (original) plus one more year (with repair), making it five years. Or perhaps, the current tires have been used for, say, three years, and repairing them will make them last one more year (total four years from purchase, same as new tires). Hmm, but the problem states that the repair makes them last for one additional year, so perhaps the repair extends the lifespan beyond the original four years.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the customer is at the point where the tires are four years old, and if they repair, the tires will last one more year (total five years). But I'm not entirely certain. Maybe the problem is simply that the repair allows the current tires to last one more year beyond their original lifespan.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the average cost per year for each option. So, for the new tires, it's four years per tire at $180, so $45 per year. For the repair, the customer pays $40 and gets one more year of use. So, if the original tires were going to last four years, the repair gives them an extra year, making the total five years. Or perhaps the repair is done on the current tires, which are perhaps already in their fourth year, and the repair makes them last one more year, so the total lifespan is five years.\n\nWait, maybe that's overcomplicating it. Let's think about the cost per year for each option.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Each tire costs $180 and lasts 4 years. So, the average cost per year is 180/4 = $45.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires. The repair costs $40 and extends their lifespan by one year. But wait, how many years are we considering for the repair option? If the current tires are already four years old, and the repair gives them one more year, then the total lifespan is five years for that tire. So, the cost is $40 for five years. Alternatively, maybe the repair is for the current tires, which were already in use for four years, and the repair gives them one more year. So, the total time is five years, but the cost is $40 for that extra year.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model both options as the cost per year for the same period. Let's say the customer is considering the next year. If they buy new tires, they'll have four years of use at $180. If they repair, they'll have one more year of use at $40.\n\nWait, that might not be the right approach. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem is to find the average cost per year for each option, and then find the percentage that the new tire cost is higher than the repair cost.\n\nFor new tires: $180 for four years. So, 180/4 = $45/year.\n\nFor repair: $40 for an additional year. So, if the current tires are already four years old, the repair gives one more year, making it five years total. So, the cost is $40 for five years. So, 40/5 = $8 per year.\n\nWait, wait, no. Because the customer is choosing between buying new tires (cost $180, lasts four years) or repairing the current tires (cost $40, lasts one more year). So, perhaps the repair is an option that, when done, extends the current tires' life by one year. So, the current tires, if repaired, will last one more year beyond their original four, making it five years.\n\nBut in that case, the average cost per year for the repair option would be the total cost (40) spread over the five years. So, 40/5 = 8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the customer is considering whether to replace the tires now or repair them now. Let's say the current tires are four years old. If the customer buys new tires, they'll have four years of use. If they repair, the tires will last one more year, so they get one more year of use.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify the current age of the tires. It just says the customer can choose between purchasing new or repairing the current ones. So perhaps the current tires are already four years old, and repairing them would make them last one more year. So, for the repair option, the customer pays $40, and gets one year of use. So, the average cost per year would be 40/1 = $40 per year.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the new tires are $45 per year. So, 45 vs 40, which would make the new tires 12.5% more expensive. Hmm, but let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are already in use for, say, three years, and the customer is deciding whether to buy new tires (four years) or repair them for an extra year. So, if he repairs, the tires will last one more year (total four years). So, the cost is $40 for four years, so 40/4 = $10 per year. Then the new tires are $45 per year. The difference is $5. So, 5/10 is 50% increase, which isn't one of the options. Hmm, that can't be right.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach this systematically.\n\nThe problem is to compute the average cost per year for each option.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Each tire costs $180, lasts 4 years. So, average cost per year is 180 /4 = $45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires. Each repair costs $40, and it makes the current tires last for one additional year. So, how many years are we talking about here? Let's think about the customer's situation. The customer's current tires are presumably at the end of their useful life. So, if they don't repair, the tires will last four years. Wait, no, the tires are already purchased and are currently in use. So, when the customer buys new tires, they last four years. So, perhaps the customer's current tires have been used for four years and are about to fail. So, if they repair them, they get one more year. So, the lifespan becomes five years.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because if the tires are already four years old, and the customer repairs them, they get one more year. So, the total lifespan is five years. So, the cost is $40 for five years. So, average cost per year is 40/5 = $8.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the new tire's average cost is $45, which is way higher than $8. So, the new tires would be way more expensive, but the options don't have a 45/8 *100% which is 562.5%. That's not one of the options either.\n\nHmm, that can't be right. Maybe I'm miscalculating the lifespan for the repair option. Let me think again. Maybe the repair isn't adding one year to the end of the lifespan but is an alternative to buying new. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is an option that can be done each year to extend the tire's life by one year each time. But the problem says, \"a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\" So, perhaps each repair adds one year. So, if the customer is at year four, they can choose to repair for $40, which gives them one more year (year five), and then they can repair again for another $40, getting year six, etc. But that's not what the problem says. The problem says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So, perhaps it's a one-time repair that adds one year.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are already four years old, and the repair makes them last one more year, so total five years. So, the customer pays $40, and the tires last for one more year (year five). So, the average cost per year would be 40 /1 = $40 for that one year. But the new tires are $45 per year. So, the new tires are 5 more per year. To find the percentage increase: (45-40)/40 = 5/40 = 0.125, which is 12.5%. So, the new tires are 12.5% more expensive per year than repairing.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense because the repair is only for one year, but the new tires last four years. Hmm, perhaps I'm not considering the correct time frame.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the average cost per year for the entire lifespan. So, if the customer buys new tires, they spend $180 for four years, so 45 per year. If they repair the current tires, which are already four years old, for $40, they get one more year, so that's 40 for one year, which is 40 per year. So, the new tires cost 45 per year, repair is 40 per year.\n\nSo, the new tires are 45/40 = 1.125 times the repair cost, which is a 12.5% increase. That would make the answer option C)12.5%.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nWait, another approach: the customer is deciding whether to buy new tires or repair the current ones. The current tires are about to fail, so the repair gives one more year of use. So, the repair option is to pay $40 and get one year. The new tires are $180 and last four years.\n\nSo, for the repair, the average cost per year is 40 /1 = $40. For new, it's 180/4 = $45. So, 45 is 12.5% higher than 40. Because (45-40)/40 = 0.125 = 12.5%.\n\nThat makes sense. So, the answer would be C)12.5%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is done when the tires are nearing the end of their four years, so the repair gives one more year beyond the original four. So, the total lifespan is five years. So, the cost is $40 for five years, which is 40/5 = $8 per year. Then new tires are 45 per year, which is 45/8 = 5.625, which is a 462.5% increase. But that's not an option.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So, if the current tires are already four years old, the repair makes them last one more year (so five years total). So, the average cost per year is 40 /5 = $8. But then the new tire's average cost is 45, which is 45/8 = 5.625, so 455% higher. That can't be right because the options don't have that.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the repair. Maybe the repair is done before the tires are four years old. For example, the customer's tires are three years old, and repairing them makes them last one more year, so total four years. So, the repair cost is $40, and the tires last four years. So, average cost per year is 40/4 = $10.\n\nThen, new tires are 180/4 = $45. So, the new tires are 45 vs 10. 45/10 = 4.5 times, which is a 350% increase. But again, that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair is done each year. Like, each year you can choose to repair for $40, which extends the life by a year. So, for example, if you have a tire that's one year old, you pay $40 to make it last another year (two years total). Then again at year two, pay another $40 to make it last another year (three years), etc. But that's not what the problem says. It says \"a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\" So, it's a one-time repair, not an ongoing thing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is an alternative to buying new tires. So, when the tires are four years old, you can either buy new ones for $180, which will last another four years, or repair for $40, which will make the current tires last one more year. So, comparing the two options for the same period. Wait, but that would be a different scenario.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer is considering the next four years. If they buy new tires, they'll cost $180 for four years, so $45 per year. If they repair, they pay $40, but how many years do the tires last? If they repair once, they get one more year, so the total time is five years. But the customer is considering a four-year period, so the repair would cover the next five years? That doesn't make sense.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back.\n\nThe problem asks: The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\n\nSo, I need to find (Cost_new - Cost_repair)/Cost_repair * 100.\n\nFirst, compute the average cost per year for each option.\n\nFor new tires:\nCost = $180 per tire.\nLifespan = 4 years.\nAverage cost per year = 180 /4 = $45.\n\nFor repairing:\nCost = $40 per tire.\nLifespan = 1 additional year (so total lifespan is 4 +1=5 years? Or is it just 1 year?)\n\nWait, perhaps the repair adds one year to the current tires. So, if the current tires have been used for, say, three years, the repair makes them last one more year, so total four years. So, the average cost per year is 40/4 = $10.\n\nAlternatively, if the current tires are four years old and the repair gives one more year, so the average cost is 40/5 = $8.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify the current age of the tires, just that the customer can choose between new or repair. So perhaps the repair option is for the current tires, which are four years old, and the repair adds one more year, making the total lifespan five years. So, the average cost per year is 40/5 = 8.\n\nThen, comparing new tires at 45 vs repair at 8.\n\nThe question is: the average cost of new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing?\n\nSo, (45 - 8)/8 * 100 = (37)/8 * 100 = 4.625 * 100 = 462.5%. That's way higher than any option. So that can't be right.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the repair. Maybe the repair is done when the tires are nearing the end of their four-year lifespan, so the repair gives one more year, making it five. So, the average cost is 40/5=8. But the new tires are 45, which is way higher. So, perhaps the problem is considering the repair as an alternative to buying new tires for the same period.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer is deciding whether to repair the tires now or buy new ones. So, the repair would extend the life of the current tires by one year, meaning that the total lifespan is five years for the repair option. But the new tires would last four years. So, to compare the cost per year, perhaps we need to consider the same period.\n\nWait, maybe the question is considering the cost over the same period, say four years. So, if the customer repairs the tires, how much would it cost over four years? Or perhaps not. I'm getting stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the two options in terms of cost per year.\n\nOption 1: New tires: $180 for 4 years \u2192 45/year.\n\nOption 2: Repair: $40 for 1 additional year \u2192 40/year (for that one year).\n\nSo, the repair is cheaper per year, but only for one year. The new tires give four years. So, if the customer chooses to repair, they'd have to repair each year to get the same four years, but the problem doesn't state that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is a one-time cost that extends the tire's life by one year, making it last five years. So, the cost is $40 for five years \u2192 8/year.\n\nSo, new tires cost 45/year, repair is 8/year. So, 45 is 45/8 = 5.625 times more, which is a 462.5% increase. But that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is an alternative to buying new tires. So, when the tires are about to fail after four years, the customer can repair them for $40 to last one more year, or buy new for $180 to last four years. So, the customer is choosing between four years of use for $180 or one year of use for $40.\n\nSo, in terms of cost per year:\n\nNew tires: 180/4 = 45/year.\n\nRepair: 40/1 =40/year.\n\nSo, the new tires are more expensive by 5 per year. To find the percentage increase: (45-40)/40 *100 = 12.5%.\n\nSo, the answer would be C)12.5%.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage by which the average cost per year of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires, we analyze both options:\n\n### Option 1: New Tires\n- **Cost**: $180 per tire  \n- **Lifespan**: 4 years  \n- **Average cost per year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\$180}{4} = \\$45 \\text{ per year}\n  \\]\n\n### Option 2: Repairing Current Tires\n- **Cost**: $40 per tire  \n- **Additional lifespan**: 1 year  \n- **Total lifespan after repair**: 1 year (the repair extends the tire's life by 1 year, and no additional lifespan beyond that is considered in this scenario).  \n- **Average cost per year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\$40}{1} = \\$40 \\text{ per year}\n  \\]\n\n### Comparison\nThe question asks for the percentage by which the average cost per year of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires. This is calculated as:  \n\\[\n\\text{Percentage increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{New tire cost} - \\text{Repair cost}}{\\text{Repair cost}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:  \n\\[\n\\text{Percentage increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\$45 - \\$40}{\\$40} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{\\$5}{\\$40} \\right) \\times 100 = 12.5\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, the average cost per year of new tires is **12.5% greater** than the cost of repairing the current tires.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about tires and costs. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is asking about the average cost per year for new tires compared to repairing the current ones, and by what percentage the new tires' cost is higher. \n\nAlright, let's break down the given information. The new tires cost $180 each and last for four years. The repair option is $40 per tire, which gives an extra year of life. So, if the customer repairs, each tire would last for one more year than before. Wait, but how long did they last before? The question says the new tires last four years when purchased new. Oh, wait, no, the current tires are being repaired. So, let me think: the customer can either buy new tires that last four years or repair their current ones for $40 each, which makes them last one more year. So, the current tires must have had some remaining life. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's see: If the current tires are repaired for $40, they last one more year. So, the original life of the current tires must be three years because adding one more year makes them last four years, same as the new tires? Or wait, perhaps the current tires are older and have been used for a while. Hmm, the problem doesn't specify the current lifespan of the tires before repair. Wait, the new tires last four years when purchased. So, the customer's current tires are presumably older. Let me re-read the question.\n\nThe question states: Tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years. So, new tires last four years. The customer can choose to buy new tires at $180 each or repair current tires at $40 each, which makes the current tires last one more year. So, the current tires, without repair, would last a certain number of years, and with repair, one more. But the problem doesn't specify how long the current tires have left. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I'm supposed to assume that the current tires are already in use and have some remaining life. Let me think differently. Suppose the customer has tires that are three years old. If they repair them, they'll last one more year, making it four years total. But without repair, they would only last one more year. Alternatively, maybe the customer is considering whether to repair the current tires for an extra year or buy new ones. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply comparing the cost per year for each option, regardless of how long the tires have been used. Let me think about what the question is asking: The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\n\nSo, maybe I should compute the average cost per year for both options and then find the percentage increase.\n\nLet's calculate the cost per year for each option.\n\nFor new tires:\nCost per tire is $180, and they last 4 years. So, the average cost per year is 180 /4 = $45 per year.\n\nFor repairing the current tires:\nThe repair costs $40 per tire and extends their life by one year. But wait, how many years will the tires last after repair? Let me clarify. The problem says that the current tires can be repaired for $40, making them last for one additional year. So, without repair, perhaps the tires have some remaining life. But the problem doesn't specify. Oh, wait, perhaps the customer's current tires are already three years old, and repairing them for another year would make their total lifespan four years. Or maybe the current tires are being used and can be repaired for one more year, regardless of their prior use.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the new tires as lasting four years, and the repaired tires as lasting one more year beyond their current state. But without knowing how long the current tires have been in use, perhaps I'm supposed to assume that the current tires are still in their original four-year lifespan. Or maybe the repair extends their life by one year beyond the four years, making them last five years? That doesn't make sense because the problem says the new tires last four years when purchased.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe customer can choose to buy new tires for $180 each, which last four years. Or, they can repair their current tires at $40 each, which makes the current tires last for one additional year. So, the current tires, if repaired, will last one more year. So, perhaps without repair, the current tires would last, say, three years. But the problem doesn't specify that. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is implying that the current tires are going to be used for one more year regardless. So, the repair allows them to have one more year beyond that. So, the cost of repair is $40 for an extra year of use.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires are at the end of their useful life, and repairing them for $40 gives them one more year. So, the customer is considering whether to repair the current tires for an extra year or buy new ones for four years.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the average cost per year for each option, considering the lifespan.\n\nSo, for new tires: cost is $180, lasts 4 years. So, average cost per year is 180 /4 = $45 per year.\n\nFor the repair option: the repair cost is $40, and it adds one year to the current tires. So, how many years would the tires last in total? Well, the problem says the new tires last four years when new. So, the current tires must have been purchased new four years ago? No, that doesn't make sense because they would already be worn out. Hmm, maybe the current tires are one year old, and repairing them for $40 would make them last one more year, totaling two years. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer's current tires are already in use for three years, and the repair would give them one more year, making it four years total. So, the cost of repair is $40 for four years of use. Or maybe the repair gives one more year beyond the current lifespan.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try another approach. The problem says that the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So, without repair, how long would they last? The problem doesn't say. So perhaps the repair adds one year, but the original lifespan isn't given. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the customer is about to replace their tires, which are three years old, and they can either buy new ones (four years of life) or repair the current ones for one more year, making them last four years in total. No, that doesn't fit because the current tires would have been in use for three years, and the repair would make them last one more, totaling four years.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires have already been used for three years, and without repair, they would last one more year (total four years). But if you repair them, they'll last five years. No, the problem says the repair makes them last one additional year, so perhaps without repair, they would last one year, and with repair, two years.\n\nWait, this is getting me nowhere. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem states that the new tires last four years when purchased. The customer can choose to repair the current tires at $40 each, making them last one additional year. So, the current tires, before repair, have a lifespan of X years, and after repair, it's X+1 years.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify X, so perhaps I'm supposed to assume that the current tires are at the point where they need repair, and without it, they would last one more year. So, the repair adds one year to their lifespan, making it two years. But without knowing X, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that the current tires are going to be used for the same number of years as the new tires, but the cost is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer is comparing two options: buy new tires now, which will last four years, or repair their current tires, which will make them last one additional year beyond their current lifespan. But without knowing how much life is left, perhaps the problem is considering that the current tires are about to fail, so without repair, they would last zero more years, and with repair, one year.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the current tires are about to have their first repair, so without repair, they would last three more years, and with repair, four years.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck because the problem doesn't give enough information about the current state of the tires.\n\nLet me approach this differently. Let's calculate the average cost per year for both options.\n\nFor new tires:\n\nCost: $180\nLifespan: 4 years\nAverage cost per year: 180 /4 = $45 per year.\n\nFor repairing the current tires:\n\nCost: $40\nLifespan: One additional year. So, if the current tires were going to last Y years without repair, they now last Y +1 years. But since the problem doesn't specify Y, perhaps Y is the same as the new tire lifespan, which is four years? That doesn't make sense because the new tires are new, and the current ones are being repaired.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires are about to be replaced, meaning they have zero life left. So, without repair, they wouldn't last any more years. But the repair gives them one more year.\n\nSo, for the repair option:\n\nCost: $40\nLifespan: 1 year\nAverage cost per year: 40 /1 = $40 per year.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the new tires cost $45 per year, the repair option is $40 per year. So, the question is, by what percentage is $45 greater than $40.\n\nSo, the calculation is: (45 -40)/40 = 5/40 = 0.125, which is 12.5%.\n\nLooking at the options, C is 12.5%.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about tires and costs. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is asking about the average cost per year for new tires compared to repairing the current ones, and by what percentage the new tires' cost is higher. \n\nAlright, let's break down the given information. The new tires cost $180 each and last for four years. The repair option is $40 per tire, which gives an extra year of life. So, if the customer repairs, each tire would last for one more year than before. Wait, but how long did they last before? The question says the new tires last four years when purchased new. Oh, wait, no, the current tires are being repaired. So, let me think: the customer can either buy new tires that last four years or repair their current ones for $40 each, which makes them last one more year. So, the current tires must have had some remaining life. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's see: If the current tires are repaired for $40, they last one more year. So, the original life of the current tires must be three years because adding one more year makes them last four years, same as the new tires? Or wait, perhaps the current tires are older and have been used for a while. Hmm, the problem doesn't specify the current lifespan of the tires before repair. Wait, the new tires last four years when purchased. So, the customer's current tires are presumably older. Let me re-read the question.\n\nThe question states: Tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years. So, new tires last four years. The customer can choose to buy new tires at $180 each or repair current tires at $40 each, which makes the current tires last one more year. So, the current tires, without repair, would last a certain number of years, and with repair, one more. But the problem doesn't specify how long the current tires have left. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I'm supposed to assume that the current tires are already in use and have some remaining life. Let me think differently. Suppose the customer has tires that are three years old. If they repair them, they'll last one more year, making it four years total. But without repair, they would only last one more year. Alternatively, maybe the customer is considering whether to repair the current tires for an extra year or buy new ones. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply comparing the cost per year for each option, regardless of how long the tires have been used. Let me think about what the question is asking: The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\n\nSo, maybe I should compute the average cost per year for both options and then find the percentage increase.\n\nLet's calculate the cost per year for each option.\n\nFor new tires:\nCost per tire is $180, and they last 4 years. So, the average cost per year is 180 /4 = $45 per year.\n\nFor repairing the current tires:\nThe repair costs $40 per tire and extends their life by one year. But wait, how many years will the tires last after repair? Let me clarify. The problem says that the current tires can be repaired for $40, making them last for one additional year. So, without repair, perhaps the tires have some remaining life. But the problem doesn't specify. Oh, wait, perhaps the customer's current tires are already three years old, and repairing them for another year would make their total lifespan four years. Or maybe the current tires are being used and can be repaired for one more year, regardless of their prior use.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the new tires as lasting four years, and the repaired tires as lasting one more year beyond their current state. But without knowing how long the current tires have been in use, perhaps I'm supposed to assume that the current tires are still in their original four-year lifespan. Or maybe the repair extends their life by one year beyond the four years, making them last five years? That doesn't make sense because the problem says the new tires last four years when purchased.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe customer can choose to buy new tires for $180 each, which last four years. Or, they can repair their current tires at $40 each, which makes the current tires last for one additional year. So, the current tires, if repaired, will last one more year. So, perhaps without repair, the current tires would last, say, three years. But the problem doesn't specify that. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is implying that the current tires are going to be used for one more year regardless. So, the repair allows them to have one more year beyond that. So, the cost of repair is $40 for an extra year of use.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires are at the end of their useful life, and repairing them for $40 gives them one more year. So, the customer is considering whether to repair the current tires for an extra year or buy new ones for four years.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the average cost per year for each option, considering the lifespan.\n\nSo, for new tires: cost is $180, lasts 4 years. So, average cost per year is 180 /4 = $45 per year.\n\nFor the repair option: the repair cost is $40, and it adds one year to the current tires. So, how many years would the tires last in total? Well, the problem says the new tires last four years when new. So, the current tires must have been purchased new four years ago? No, that doesn't make sense because they would already be worn out. Hmm, maybe the current tires are one year old, and repairing them for $40 would make them last one more year, totaling two years. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer's current tires are already in use for three years, and the repair would give them one more year, making it four years total. So, the cost of repair is $40 for four years of use. Or maybe the repair gives one more year beyond the current lifespan.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try another approach. The problem says that the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So, without repair, how long would they last? The problem doesn't say. So perhaps the repair adds one year, but the original lifespan isn't given. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the customer is about to replace their tires, which are three years old, and they can either buy new ones (four years of life) or repair the current ones for one more year, making them last four years in total. No, that doesn't fit because the current tires would have been in use for three years, and the repair would make them last one more, totaling four years.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires have already been used for three years, and without repair, they would last one more year (total four years). But if you repair them, they'll last five years. No, the problem says the repair makes them last one additional year, so perhaps without repair, they would last one year, and with repair, two years.\n\nWait, this is getting me nowhere. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem states that the new tires last four years when purchased. The customer can choose to repair the current tires at $40 each, making them last one additional year. So, the current tires, before repair, have a lifespan of X years, and after repair, it's X+1 years.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify X, so perhaps I'm supposed to assume that the current tires are at the point where they need repair, and without it, they would last one more year. So, the repair adds one year to their lifespan, making it two years.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about tires and costs. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand. \n\nThe tires, when bought new, last for four years. A customer can either buy new tires for $180 each or have their current ones repaired for $40 each. The repair makes the tires last one more year. The question is asking about the average cost per year for the new tires compared to the repaired ones. Specifically, how much greater is the average cost per year of the new tires compared to the repaired tires, and what's the percentage difference.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. First, I think I need to calculate the average cost per year for both options.\n\nStarting with the new tires. Each tire costs $180 and lasts four years. So the average cost per year would be the total cost divided by the number of years. So that's 180 divided by 4. Let me do that math: 180 / 4 is 45. So the average cost per year for new tires is $45.\n\nNow for the repaired tires. The customer already has tires, and repairs cost $40 each, extending their life by one year. Wait, so the original tires last four years, but after repair, they last five years total? Because the problem says the repair makes them last for one additional year. So initial lifespan is four years, repair adds one, making it five years.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says when purchased new, they last four years. So the current tires the customer has must have been purchased new, so they've already been in use for some time. But I think the problem is about the cost per year, so perhaps I should just consider the cost of the repair and the extended life.\n\nSo the customer can choose to repair each tire for $40, which makes it last one more year. So the repair cost is $40 for an extra year.\n\nSo the total lifespan after repair is five years, right? Because they were going to last four, but now they last five. So the total cost for the customer's current tires is the repair cost, which is $40 per tire, and the lifespan is five years.\n\nWait, but wait, the initial cost of the current tires is not considered here. The question is about the average cost per year of the new tires versus the repair option. So I think the current tires have already been purchased, so the only cost now is the repair. Because if you don't repair, perhaps you have to buy new ones. But the problem gives two options: buy new tires for $180, or repair for $40 each, which gives an extra year.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that the current tires are about to wear out. So if you don't repair, they'll last four years. If you repair, they'll last five. So the repair gives you one more year of life. So the cost of repair is $40 for that extra year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires are already in use. So without repair, they last four years total. With repair, they last five. So the cost of repair is $40, and that gives you one more year of use.\n\nSo for the repair option, the cost is $40 per tire, and the lifespan is five years. So the average cost per year for the repair would be 40 divided by 5, which is 8 dollars per year.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Because if the customer is considering whether to buy new tires or repair the current ones, perhaps the repair is an alternative to buying new. So for the repair option, the total cost is $40, and you get an extra year of use. So the total lifespan becomes five years with the repair, and the cost is 40. Without repair, the tires would last four years, but perhaps the customer would then have to buy new ones after that.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe problem says, the customer can choose to buy new tires at $180 each, which last four years, or have his current tires repaired at $40 each, which makes them last for one additional year.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires have already been used for some time, and they are about to fail. So the customer has the choice: buy new tires (cost 180, last four years) or repair the current ones (cost 40, last one more year). So, if they repair, their current tires would last one more year beyond their current state.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires have already been in use for four years. But no, when new, they last four years. So the customer's current tires would have been purchased new and are now at year four, about to fail. So if they don't repair, they'll have to buy new tires. But if they repair, they can use them for one more year.\n\nWait, that's a different scenario. So perhaps the customer is at the end of the four years, and the tires are about to fail. So their options are: buy new tires (180), which will last four more years, or repair the current ones (40), which will make them last one more year.\n\nSo for the repair option, the cost is $40 for an extra year. So the average cost per year for the repair would be 40 / 1 = 40, but that's only for one year. Alternatively, perhaps the customer is considering the cost for each tire, and how much each year costs on average.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model both options as the cost per year for each tire.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires for $180. They last four years. So per year cost is 180 /4 = 45.\n\nOption 2: Repair for $40, which extends the lifespan by one year. So the total lifespan after repair is five years. So the cost is 40, but how many years does it cover? It's an additional year beyond the original four? Or is it that the repair allows the current tires to last one more year beyond their original four?\n\nWait, the problem says when purchased new, they last four years. The customer's current tires are presumably new and have been used for four years. So if they repair, the tires last one more year, making the total lifespan five years.\n\nBut the repair is done when the tires are four years old, so the cost is $40 for the fifth year.\n\nWait, perhaps the scenario is that the customer is considering whether to repair their current tires or replace them. So the current tires are four years old, about to fail. The options are:\n\n- Replace with new tires: pay 180, get four years of use.\n\n- Repair current tires: pay 40, get one more year of use (so total of five years from the original purchase).\n\nWait, no. Wait, if the current tires are four years old and you repair them, they last one more year, so their total lifespan is five years. So the cost is 40 for the fifth year.\n\nSo for the repair option, the cost is 40, and the number of years is one (the fifth year). So the average cost per year for the repair is 40 /1 =40.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Because if you buy new tires, you're paying 180 for four years, so 45 per year. The repair is 40 for one year, so 40 per year. So the new tires are more expensive per year.\n\nBut the question is, the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing. So (45 - 40) /40 *100% = (5/40)*100% = 12.5%. So the answer would be 12.5%, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Because the repair is for the current tires, which are about to fail. So the alternative is: either repair now (cost 40, get one year), and then after that, you'd have to buy new tires. Or buy new tires now, which last four years.\n\nSo perhaps the comparison is between the two options for the same period. Or perhaps the problem is considering the average cost per year for each option when used for their entire lifespan.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the average cost per year for each tire, regardless of the number of years they last.\n\nLet me think again. Let's model both options.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Each tire costs 180, lasts four years. So per year cost is 180 /4 = 45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires. Each repair costs 40, and extends the tire's lifespan by one year. So the tire now lasts five years. So the cost is 40 for five years. So per year cost is 40 /5 =8.\n\nWait, that's a different approach. Because the original tire's lifespan is four years, but with repair, it's five. So the cost is 40 for five years, so 8 per year.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the original cost of the tire when new was 180. So if you buy a tire new, it's 180 for four years. Then you repair it for 40, making it last five years. So the total cost for that tire would be 180 +40=220 for five years. So the average cost per year is 220 /5 =44.\n\nWait, but that's a different approach. The problem says the customer can choose to purchase new tires at 180 or repair current tires at 40, which makes them last one more year.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the customer is currently using tires, and can either repair them (cost 40) to have them last one more year, or buy new ones (180) that last four years. So for the next four years, if they buy new, the cost is 180, giving four years. If they repair, they get one more year for 40, but then what? After that, they'd have to replace again.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question is about the average cost per year for the new tires compared to the repair. So the new tires have a higher cost per year, and we're to find the percentage increase.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the average cost per year for each option.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Cost per tire: 180. Lifespan: 4 years. So average cost per year: 180 /4 =45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires. Cost per tire:40. Lifespan: the current tires last four years, but after repair, they last one more year. So the total lifespan is five years. So the cost is 40, and it's for five years. So average cost per year:40 /5=8.\n\nSo the average cost per year for new tires is 45, for repair it's 8. So the question is, what percent greater is 45 compared to 8.\n\nSo the formula for percentage increase is ((new - old)/old)*100%.\n\nSo (45 -8)/8 *100% = (37/8)*100% =4.625 *100% =462.5%.\n\nBut that's not one of the options. Hmm. That can't be right, because the options given are 8%,10%, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the average cost for the repair option. Let me think again. The repair option is for the current tires. So perhaps the customer's current tires are already four years old, and repairing them for $40 gives them one more year (total of five years from when they were new). So the cost is 40 for that one year. So the average cost per year for the repair is 40 per year for that fifth year. So the average cost per year is 40.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if the tire is four years old and you repair it for 40, it gives you one more year. So the cost is 40 for that one year. So the average cost per year is 40.\n\nSo then, the new tire's average cost is 45 per year, repair is 40 per year.\n\nSo the question is, how much greater is 45 than 40. So the increase is 5. So 5/40 = 0.125, which is 12.5%. So the answer would be C)12.5%.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm modeling this correctly. Let me think about the scenarios again.\n\nScenario 1: Buy new tires. You pay 180, and they last four years. So each year, you're effectively paying 45.\n\nScenario 2: Repair current tires. You pay 40, and they last one more year. So for that one year, you pay 40. So the average cost per year for that one year is 40.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the question is comparing the cost per year over the same period. For example, if you choose to repair, you get one more year, but you'd have to repair again after that, or buy new.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the customer has the option to either buy new tires (180, four years) or repair the current tires (40, one year). So perhaps the customer is looking to cover a certain number of years, like four years, and compare the costs.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach it differently.\n\nThe problem says, \"the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\" So the question is comparing the average cost per year of the new tires versus the average cost per year of the repair option.\n\nSo for the new tires: 180 per tire, four years. So average per year is 45.\n\nFor the repair: 40 per tire, but how many years? Because repairing extends the life by one year. So if the customer's tires are about to fail, and they repair them, they get one more year. So the cost is 40 for that one year. So the average cost per year is 40.\n\nSo the new tires are 45 per year, repair is 40 per year. So the new tires are 5 more per year.\n\nSo the percentage increase is (5/40)*100% =12.5%.\n\nSo the answer is C)12.5%.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about tires and costs. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand. \n\nThe tires, when bought new, last for four years. A customer can either buy new tires for $180 each or have their current ones repaired for $40 each. The repair makes the tires last one more year. The question is asking about the average cost per year for the new tires compared to the repaired ones. Specifically, how much greater is the average cost per year of the new tires compared to the repaired tires, and what's the percentage difference.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. First, I think I need to calculate the average cost per year for both options.\n\nStarting with the new tires. Each tire costs $180 and lasts four years. So the average cost per year would be the total cost divided by the number of years. So that's 180 divided by 4. Let me do that math: 180 / 4 is 45. So the average cost per year for new tires is $45.\n\nNow for the repaired tires. The customer already has tires, and repairs cost $40 each, extending their life by one year. Wait, so the original tires last four years, but after repair, they last five years total? Because the problem says the repair makes them last for one additional year. So initial lifespan is four years, repair adds one, making it five years.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says when purchased new, they last four years. So the current tires the customer has must have been purchased new, so they've already been in use for some time. But I think the problem is about the cost per year, so perhaps I should just consider the cost of the repair and the extended life.\n\nSo the customer can choose to repair each tire for $40, which makes it last one more year. So the repair cost is $40 for an extra year.\n\nSo the total lifespan after repair is five years, right? Because they were going to last four, but now they last five. So the total cost for the customer's current tires is the repair cost, which is $40 per tire, and the lifespan is five years.\n\nWait, but wait, the initial cost of the current tires is not considered here. The question is about the average cost per year of the new tires versus the repair option. So I think the current tires have already been purchased, so the only cost now is the repair. Because if you don't repair, perhaps you have to buy new ones. But the problem gives two options: buy new tires for $180, or repair for $40 each, which gives an extra year.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that the current tires are about to wear out. So if you don't repair, they'll last four years. If you repair, they'll last five. So the repair gives you one more year of life. So the cost of repair is $40 for that extra year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires are already in use. So without repair, they last four years total. With repair, they last five. So the cost of repair is $40, and that gives you one more year of use.\n\nSo for the repair option, the cost is $40 per tire, and the lifespan is five years. So the average cost per year for the repair would be 40 divided by 5, which is 8 dollars per year.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Because if the customer is considering whether to buy new tires or repair the current ones, perhaps the repair is an alternative to buying new. So for the repair option, the total cost is $40, and you get an extra year of use. So the total lifespan becomes five years with the repair, and the cost is 40. Without repair, the tires would last four years, but perhaps the customer would then have to buy new ones after that.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe problem says, the customer can choose to buy new tires at $180 each, which last four years, or have his current tires repaired at $40 each, which makes them last for one additional year.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires have already been used for some time, and they are about to fail. So the customer has the choice: buy new tires (cost 180, last four years) or repair the current ones (cost 40, last one more year). So, if they repair, their current tires would last one more year beyond their current state.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires have already been in use for four years. But no, when new, they last four years. So the customer's current tires would have been purchased new and are now at year four, about to fail. So if they don't repair, they'll have to buy new tires. But if they repair, they can use them for one more year.\n\nWait, that's a different scenario. So perhaps the customer is at the end of the four years, and the tires are about to fail. So their options are: buy new tires (180), which will last four more years, or repair the current ones (40), which will make them last one more year.\n\nSo for the repair option, the cost is $40 for an extra year. So the average cost per year for the repair would be 40 / 1 = 40, but that's only for one year. Alternatively, perhaps the customer is considering the cost for each tire, and how much each year costs on average.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model both options as the cost per year for each tire.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires for $180. They last four years. So per year cost is 180 /4 = 45.\n\nOption 2: Repair for $40, which extends the lifespan by one year. So the total lifespan after repair is five years. So the cost is 40, but how many years does it cover? It's an additional year beyond the original four? Or is it that the repair allows the current tires to last one more year beyond their original four?\n\nWait, the problem says when purchased new, they last four years. The customer's current tires are presumably new and have been used for four years. So if they repair, the tires last one more year, making the total lifespan five years.\n\nBut the repair is done when the tires are four years old, so the cost is $40 for the fifth year.\n\nWait, perhaps the scenario is that the customer is considering whether to repair their current tires or replace them. So the current tires are four years old, about to fail. The options are:\n\n- Replace with new tires: pay 180, get four years of use.\n\n- Repair current tires: pay 40, get one more year of use (so total of five years from the original purchase).\n\nWait, no. Wait, if the current tires are four years old and you repair them, they last one more year, so their total lifespan is five years. So the cost is 40 for the fifth year.\n\nSo for the repair option, the cost is 40, and the number of years is one (the fifth year). So the average cost per year for the repair is 40 /1 =40.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Because if you buy new tires, you're paying 180 for four years, so 45 per year. The repair is 40 for one year, so 40 per year. So the new tires are more expensive per year.\n\nBut the question is, the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing. So (45 - 40) /40 *100% = (5/40)*100% = 12.5%. So the answer would be 12.5%, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Because the repair is for the current tires, which are about to fail. So the alternative is: either repair now (cost 40, get one year), and then after that, you'd have to buy new tires. Or buy new tires now, which last four years.\n\nSo perhaps the comparison is between the two options for the same period. Or perhaps the problem is considering the average cost per year for each option when used for their entire lifespan.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the average cost per year for each tire, regardless of the number of years they last.\n\nLet me think again. Let's model both options.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Each tire costs 180, lasts four years. So per year cost is 180 /4 = 45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires. Each repair costs 40, and extends the tire's lifespan by one year. So the tire now lasts five years. So the cost is 40 for five years. So per year cost is 40 /5 =8.\n\nWait, that's a different approach. Because the original tire's lifespan is four years, but with repair, it's five. So the cost is 40 for five years, so 8 per year.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the original cost of the tire when new was 180. So if you buy a tire new, it's 180 for four years. Then you repair it for 40, making it last five years. So the total cost for that tire would be 180 +40=220 for five years. So the average cost per year is 220 /5 =44.\n\nWait, but that's a different approach. The problem says the customer can choose to purchase new tires at 180 or repair current tires at 40, which makes them last one more year.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the customer is currently using tires, and can either repair them (cost 40) to have them last one more year, or buy new ones (180) that last four years. So for the next four years, if they buy new, the cost is 180, giving four years. If they repair, they get one more year for 40, but then what? After that, they'd have to replace again.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question is about the average cost per year for the new tires compared to the repair. So the new tires have a higher cost per year, and we're to find the percentage increase.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the average cost per year for each option.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Cost per tire: 180. Lifespan: 4 years. So average cost per year: 180 /4 =45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires. Cost per tire:40. Lifespan: the current tires last four years, but after repair, they last one more year. So the total lifespan is five years. So the cost is 40, and it's for five years. So average cost per year:40 /5=8.\n\nSo the average cost per year for new tires is 45, for repair it's 8. So the question is, what percent greater is 45 compared to 8.\n\nSo the formula for percentage increase is ((new - old)/old)*100%.\n\nSo (45 -8)/8 *100% = (37/8)*100% =4.625 *100% =462.5%.\n\nBut that's not one of the options. Hmm. That can't be right, because the options given are 8%,10%, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the average cost for the repair option. Let me think again. The repair option is for the current tires. So perhaps the customer's current tires are already four years old, and repairing them for $40 gives them one more year (total of five years from when they were new). So the cost is 40 for that one year. So the average cost per year for the repair is 40 per year for that fifth year. So the average cost per year is 40.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if the tire is four years old and you repair it for 40, it gives you one more year. So the cost is 40 for that one year. So the average cost per year is 40.\n\nSo then, the new tire's average cost is 45 per year, repair is 40 per year.\n\nSo the question is, how much greater is 45 than 40. So the increase is 5. So 5/40 = 0.125, which is 12.5%. So the answer would be C)12.5%.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm modeling this correctly. Let me think about the scenarios again.\n\nScenario 1: Buy new tires. You pay 180, and they last four years. So each year, you're effectively paying 45.\n\nScenario 2: Repair current tires. You pay 40, and they last one more year. So for that one year, you pay 40. So the average cost per year for that one year is 40.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the question is comparing the cost per year over the same period. For example, if you choose to repair, you get one more year, but you'd have to repair again after that, or buy new.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the customer has the option to either buy new tires (180, four years) or repair the current tires (40, one year). So perhaps the customer is looking to cover a certain number of years, like four years, and compare the costs.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach it differently.\n\nThe problem says, \"the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\" So the question is comparing the average cost per year of the new tires versus the average cost per year of the repair option.\n\nSo for the new tires: 180 per tire, four years. So average per year is 45.\n\nFor the repair: 40 per tire, but how many years? Because repairing extends the life by one year. So if the customer's tires are about to fail, and they repair them, they get one more year. So the cost is 40 for that one year. So the average cost per year is 40.\n\nSo the new tires are 45 per year, repair is 40 per year. So the new tires are 5 more per year.\n\nSo the percentage increase is (5/40)*100% =12.5%.\n\nSo the answer is C)12.5%.\n\n\nTo determine the average cost per year of the new tires compared to the cost of repairing the current tires, we analyze both options:\n\n### Option 1: New Tires\n- **Cost per tire**: $180  \n- **Lifespan**: 4 years  \n- **Average cost per year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\text{Total cost}}{\\text{Lifespan}} = \\frac{180}{4} = 45 \\, \\text{\\$/year}\n  \\]\n\n### Option 2: Repair Current Tires\n- **Cost per tire**: $40  \n- **Additional lifespan**: 1 year  \n- **Total lifespan after repair**: 5 years (original 4 years + 1 year from repair)  \n- **Average cost per year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\text{Total cost}}{\\text{Total lifespan}} = \\frac{40}{5} = 8 \\, \\text{\\$/year}\n  \\]\n\n### Percentage Difference\nThe question asks how much greater the average cost per year of the new tires is compared to the repair option. The formula for percentage increase is:  \n\\[\n\\text{Percentage increase} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{New cost} - \\text{Repair cost}}{\\text{Repair cost}}\\right) \\times 100\\%\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:  \n\\[\n\\text{Percentage increase} = \\left(\\frac{45 - 8}{8}\\right) \\times 100\\% = \\left(\\frac{37}{8}\\right) \\times 100\\% = 462.5\\%\n\\]\n\nThis result does not match the given options, indicating a misunderstanding of the repair scenario.
