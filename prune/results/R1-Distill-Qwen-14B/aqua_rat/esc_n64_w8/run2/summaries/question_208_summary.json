      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quadratic equation problem here, and I need to find the largest integer value of k such that the equation has two real and distinct roots. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nWait, right. For a quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, the discriminant tells us about the nature of the roots. The discriminant is b\u00b2 - 4ac. If the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots. If it's zero, one real root, and if it's negative, the roots are complex.\n\nIn this problem, the equation is x\u00b2 -5x + k = 0. So here, a is 1, b is -5, and c is k. I should calculate the discriminant.\n\nDiscriminant D = (-5)\u00b2 - 4 * 1 * k = 25 - 4k. For two distinct real roots, D must be greater than zero. So 25 - 4k > 0.\n\nLet me solve that inequality. 25 -4k >0 \u2192 -4k > -25. When I divide both sides by -4, I have to remember that dividing by a negative reverses the inequality. So k < 25/4.\n\nWait, 25 divided by 4 is 6.25. So k must be less than 6.25. Since the question asks for the largest integral value, the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. But wait, looking at the options, 6 isn't an option. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nHmm, did I do something wrong? Let me double-check. Oh wait, wait a second. Maybe I messed up the discriminant calculation.\n\nWait, the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. Discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac, so (-5)^2 is 25, 4ac is 4*1*k=4k. So 25 -4k must be greater than zero. So 25>4k \u2192 25/4=6.25, so k<6.25.\n\nSo the maximum integer k is 6. But wait, the options don't have 6. Let me look at the options again: A is 9, B is7, C is3, D is8, E is12.\n\nWait a minute, none of these are 6. So maybe I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. Correct. So discriminant is 25-4k>0. So k must be less than 6.25. So the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. But 6 isn't an option here. That's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. Did I miscalculate the discriminant? Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I read the equation wrong. Oh wait, no. The equation is definitely x\u00b2 -5x +k. So a is 1, b is -5, c is k. So D=25-4k.\n\nWait, unless the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k, but no, the question says x\u00b2 -5x +k.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality. Let me recheck.\n\n25 -4k >0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192 k <25/4 \u2192 25/4 is 6.25, correct. So k must be less than 6.25, so the maximum integer is 6. But options don't have 6.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the largest integer k where the equation has real roots, regardless of being distinct? No, the question specifically says two real and distinct roots, so discriminant must be positive.\n\nWait, but maybe the options are correct and I'm miscalculating. Let me think: perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k, so discriminant is 25-4k. So for two distinct real roots, 25-4k>0 \u2192 k <6.25. So the largest integer is 6. But the options don't have 6. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking back at the options: options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. None of these are 6. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me read the problem again.\n\nAh, wait! Did I read the equation correctly? Oh wait, the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So that's correct. Hmm. So what's the correct answer? The options don't have 6, so maybe the question is wrong, or I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps the quadratic is x\u00b2 +5x +k. Let me try that. Then discriminant is 25 -4k. So 25-4k>0 \u2192 same condition. No, same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x -k =0. Then discriminant would be 25 +4k. So 25+4k>0 \u2192 always true for k>-6.25. So then any k would work, but the problem is about the maximum k. But that's not the case here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is written as x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Then discriminant is 25-4k>0 \u2192 k<6.25. So same conclusion.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the options are wrong. But maybe I made a mistake elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the smallest integer value. No, the question says largest. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I mixed up the equation. Let me write it again: x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So the coefficients are a=1, b=-5, c=k. So D = b\u00b2 -4ac = 25 -4k.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the equation is  x\u00b2 -5k x + something? No, the question is x\u00b2-5x +k=0.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is correct, but the options don't include the correct answer. But that can't be the case. So perhaps the options are correct and I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant calculation. Let me compute again.\n\nWait, discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. b is -5, so (-5)^2 is 25. 4ac is 4*1*k=4k. So 25-4k>0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192 k<6.25. So the maximum integer is 6.\n\nBut the options don't have 6, so I must be missing something. Oh wait! Wait, perhaps the quadratic is written as x\u00b2 -5x +k, but the question is about the largest k where the equation has two real roots, which could include repeated roots. Because if discriminant is zero, there's exactly one real root. But the question says two real and distinct roots, so discriminant must be positive.\n\nSo if the options don't have 6, perhaps the question is written incorrectly, or perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x + k\u00b2 =0. Because then c would be k squared, and the discriminant would be 25 -4k\u00b2>0 \u2192 4k\u00b2 <25 \u2192 k\u00b2 <6.25 \u2192 k < sqrt(6.25)=2.5. So the maximum integer is 2. But that's not in the options either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5k x +k=0. Then a=1, b=-5k, c=k. Discriminant would be (25k\u00b2) -4*1*k=25k\u00b2-4k. For two real roots, 25k\u00b2 -4k>0 \u2192 k(25k -4) >0. So for k positive, 25k-4>0 \u2192 k>4/25=0.16. So for k>0.16, which would have integer values starting from 1, but that's not matching the options either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5k x + something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So the discriminant is 25-4k>0. So k must be less than 6.25. So the largest integer is 6. But the options don't include 6. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options. But that's unlikely.\n\nWait, looking at the options, the closest lower integer is 6, but the options don't have it. So perhaps the question is about the maximum value of k where the equation has real roots, including repeated ones. Then the discriminant is \u22650. So 25-4k\u22650 \u2192k\u22646.25. So the maximum integer is 6, same as before.\n\nBut the options don't have 6. So perhaps the correct answer isn't present, but that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the options again. Oh wait, option B is 7, which is larger than 6.25. So if k=7, the discriminant would be 25-4*7=25-28=-3, which is negative. So the roots would be complex, not real and distinct.\n\nOption D is 8. 25-4*8=25-32=-7. Negative again.\n\nOption A is 9: 25-36= -11. Also negative.\n\nOption E is 12: 25-48= -23. Negative.\n\nOption C is 3: 25-12=13>0. So it works, but it's not the largest possible.\n\nWait, but the options only have 3,7,8,9,12. So the only option that is less than 6.25 is C)3. Because 3 is less than 6.25, but 7 is higher. So the largest k in the options that is less than 6.25 is 3? No, because 3 is smaller than 6.25, but wait, there's another option: Wait, looking again, the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. So the only value less than 6.25 is 3. So the correct answer would be 3. But that can't be right, because 6 is the maximum, but it's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is 6, but it's not listed. So perhaps the problem is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Let me read again: \"the quadratic equation x\u00b2 -5x +k =0 will have two real and distinct roots.\" So discriminant must be positive. So k must be less than 6.25. So the largest integer is 6. But since 6 isn't an option, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5k x +k=0. Then discriminant is (25k\u00b2) -4k. Setting that greater than zero: 25k\u00b2 -4k>0 \u2192 k(25k -4) >0. So for positive k, 25k-4>0 \u2192 k>4/25=0.16. So the largest integer k is any integer greater than 0.16, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. It says \"the largest integral value of k\". So perhaps I should look for the maximum k where the equation has real roots, not necessarily distinct. So discriminant \u22650. So 25-4k \u22650 \u2192k \u22646.25. So maximum integer is 6. Still not in the options.\n\nHmm, this is puzzling. All the options have k values larger than 6.25 except for option C, which is 3. But 3 is much smaller than 6.25, so perhaps I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is reversed. Maybe it's asking for the smallest integral value of k where the equation has two real and distinct roots. No, the question says \"largest\".\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating the discriminant. Let me do it again.\n\nEquation: x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k.\n\nDiscriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac = (-5)^2 -4*1*k =25 -4k.\n\nSet D>0: 25 -4k>0 \u21924k <25 \u2192k <6.25.\n\nSo k can be 6,5,4, etc. The largest integer is 6. But since 6 isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed. But that's unlikely; maybe I'm missing a trick.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about the quadratic in terms of x, but the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, and k is a variable. So perhaps I'm supposed to find k such that for any x, the equation holds, but that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps the equation is in terms of k, but that would be rearranged.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the answer is option C)3, but that doesn't seem right because 3 is much less than 6.25.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is to find the maximum k for which the equation has real roots, not necessarily distinct. Then, k can be up to 6.25. But again, no option matches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is written incorrectly, and the equation is x\u00b2 -5x -k=0. Then discriminant is 25 +4k>0. So any k greater than -6.25 would work. So the maximum integer is unbounded. That can't be the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me see: If the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, discriminant is 25-4k. So for two distinct roots, 25-4k>0 \u2192k<6.25. So the largest integer is 6. So the correct answer is 6, but it's not among the options. So perhaps the correct option is not present, but that's not possible.\n\nWait, looking at the options again: A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. None of these are less than 6.25 except C)3. So the only possible correct answer from the options is 3, but that's not the largest possible. So perhaps the question is wrong, or the options are incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake and the discriminant should be positive, but perhaps the equation is written differently. Let me think: perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Then discriminant is 25-4k>0 \u2192k<6.25. So same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, and I'm supposed to find the maximum k where the roots are integers. But that's a different question. Let me think about that. For the roots to be integers, the discriminant must be a perfect square. So 25-4k must be a perfect square. So possible values of 25-4k: 25-4k = m\u00b2, where m is an integer. So 4k =25 -m\u00b2 \u2192k=(25 -m\u00b2)/4.\n\nWe need k to be an integer, so 25 -m\u00b2 must be divisible by 4. Let's see possible m.\n\nm must be odd because 25 is odd, and m\u00b2 will be odd if m is odd. So 25 - m\u00b2 is even, so 4 divides 25 -m\u00b2.\n\nLet me find m such that 25 -m\u00b2 is positive and divisible by 4.\n\nPossible m: m can be 1,3,5.\n\nm=1: 25-1=24 \u2192k=24/4=6.\n\nm=3: 25-9=16 \u2192k=16/4=4.\n\nm=5: 25-25=0 \u2192k=0. But 0 would give a discriminant of 0, so the roots are equal, not distinct.\n\nm=7: 25-49= -24 \u2192k= -24/4= -6. But negative k would make the equation x\u00b2 -5x -6=0. Discriminant is 25+24=49>0. But the question is about two real and distinct roots, which is satisfied, but k is -6. But the question is about the largest integral k, which would be 6.\n\nBut the options don't have 6. So perhaps the answer is 6, but it's not present. So perhaps the question intended to ask for integer roots, but that's a different scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is correct and the options are wrong. But since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps the intended answer is 6, but it's not present. So perhaps the intended setup was different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5k x +k=0. Let's compute discriminant again.\n\nDiscriminant D = ( -5k )\u00b2 -4*1*k =25k\u00b2 -4k. So for D>0: 25k\u00b2 -4k>0 \u2192k(25k -4) >0.\n\nSo when k>4/25 (\u22480.16) \u2192k>0.16. So any k>0.16, including integer k=1,2,3,...\n\nSo the largest integral value would be unbounded. So that doesn't make sense.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. According to my calculations, the correct answer is 6, but it's not an option. So perhaps the intended setup is different, or there's a mistake in the question. But given the options, I have to choose the best possible answer.\n\nWait, looking at the options again, maybe I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me read the problem once more.\n\nThe problem says: What is the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x2 - 5x + k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots?\n\nSo, the equation is definitely x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So I think the answer should be 6, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is the largest option that is less than 6.25. But all the options (A:9, B:7, C:3, D:8, E:12) are higher than 6.25 except C:3. So if I have to choose from these, the only option that satisfies k<6.25 is C:3.\n\nWait, but 3 is much less than 6.25. So perhaps the correct answer is 3, but that's not the largest possible. It's the only option that works. So perhaps the intended answer is C)3.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because 6 is larger and works. So I'm confused. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask for the smallest k, but that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant. Let me recalculate:\n\nD = b\u00b2 -4ac = (-5)^2 -4(1)(k) =25 -4k.\n\nSet D>0 \u219225-4k>0 \u21924k<25 \u2192k<6.25. So maximum integer k is 6.\n\nBut since 6 isn't an option, perhaps the problem is incorrect. But given the options, the only possible correct answer is 3, but that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options were misprinted, and the intended correct option is 6, but it's not present. So perhaps the correct answer is 6, but it's not listed.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the options again. Oh, wait, option B is 7. Let me check what happens when k=7.\n\nD=25 -4*7=25-28= -3 <0 \u2192 roots are complex. So it's invalid.\n\nSame with k=8: D=25-32= -7<0.\n\nk=9: 25-36=-11<0.\n\nk=12: 25-48=-23<0.\n\nSo all options except C)3 give negative discriminant, which means no real roots. So only k=3 works. So the largest possible k among the options is 3, which is option C.\n\nWait, but 3 is much less than 6.25. So perhaps the correct answer is 3, but that's not the maximum possible. It's the maximum among the options given.\n\nSo the correct answer is C)3.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quadratic equation problem here, and I need to find the largest integer value of k such that the equation has two real and distinct roots.

I should calculate the discriminant.\n\nDiscriminant D = (-5)\u00b2 - 4 * 1 * k = 25 - 4k. For two distinct real roots, D must be greater than zero.

So then any k would work, but the problem is about the maximum k. But that's not the case here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is written as x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Then discriminant is 25-4k>0 \u2192 k<6.25. So same conclusion.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the options are wrong. But maybe I made a mistake elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the smallest integer value. No, the question says largest. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I mixed up the equation. Let me write it again: x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So the coefficients are a=1, b=-5, c=k. So D = b\u00b2 -4ac = 25 -4k.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the equation is  x\u00b2 -5k x + something? No, the question is x\u00b2-5x +k=0.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is correct, but the options don't include the correct answer. But that can't be the case. So perhaps the options are correct and I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant calculation. Let me compute again.\n\nWait, discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. b is -5, so (-5)^2 is 25. 4ac is 4*1*k=4k. So 25-4k>0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192 k<6.25. So the maximum integer is 6.\n\nBut the options don't have 6, so I must be missing something. Oh wait! Wait, perhaps the quadratic is written as x\u00b2 -5x +k, but the question is about the largest k where the equation has two real roots, which could include repeated roots. Because if discriminant is zero, there's exactly one real root. But the question says two real and distinct roots, so discriminant must be positive.\n\nSo if the options don't have 6, perhaps the question is written incorrectly, or perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x + k\u00b2 =0. Because then c would be k squared, and the discriminant would be 25 -4k\u00b2>0 \u2192 4k\u00b2 <25 \u2192 k\u00b2 <6.25 \u2192 k < sqrt(6.25)=2.5. So the maximum integer is 2. But that's not in the options either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5k x +k=0. Then a=1, b=-5k, c=k. Discriminant would be (25k\u00b2) -4*1*k=25k\u00b2-4k. For two real roots, 25k\u00b2 -4k>0 \u2192 k(25k -4) >0. So for k positive, 25k-4>0 \u2192 k>4/25=0.16. So for k>0.16, which would have integer values starting from 1, but that's not matching the options either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5k x + something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So the discriminant is 25-4k>0. So k must be less than 6.25. So the largest integer is 6. But the options don't include 6. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options. But that's unlikely.\n\nWait, looking at the options, the closest lower integer is 6, but the options don't have it. So perhaps the question is about the maximum value of k where the equation has real roots, including repeated ones. Then the discriminant is \u22650. So 25-4k\u22650 \u2192k\u22646.25. So the maximum integer is 6, same as before.\n\nBut the options don't have 6. So perhaps the correct answer isn't present, but that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the options again. Oh wait, option B is 7, which is larger than 6.25. So if k=7, the discriminant would be 25-4*7=25-28=-3, which is negative. So the roots would be complex, not real and distinct.\n\nOption D is 8. 25-4*8=25-32=-7. Negative again.\n\nOption A is 9: 25-36= -11. Also negative.\n\nOption E is 12: 25-48= -23. Negative.\n\nOption C is 3: 25-12=13>0. So it works, but it's not the largest possible.\n\nWait, but the options only have 3,7,8,9,12. So the only option that is less than 6.25 is C)3. Because 3 is less than 6.25, but 7 is higher. So the largest k in the options that is less than 6.25 is 3? No, because 3 is smaller than 6.25, but wait, there's another option: Wait, looking again, the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. So the only value less than 6.25 is 3. So the correct answer would be 3. But that can't be right, because 6 is the maximum, but it's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is 6, but it's not listed. So perhaps the problem is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Let me read again: \"the quadratic equation x\u00b2 -5x +k =0 will have two real and distinct roots.\" So discriminant must be positive. So k must be less than 6.25. So the largest integer is 6. But since 6 isn't an option, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5k x +k=0. Then discriminant is (25k\u00b2) -4k. Setting that greater than zero: 25k\u00b2 -4k>0 \u2192 k(25k -4) >0. So for positive k, 25k-4>0 \u2192 k>4/25=0.16. So the largest integer k is any integer greater than 0.16, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. It says \"the largest integral value of k\". So perhaps I should look for the maximum k where the equation has real roots, not necessarily distinct. So discriminant \u22650. So 25-4k \u22650 \u2192k \u22646.25. So maximum integer is 6. Still not in the options.\n\nHmm, this is puzzling. All the options have k values larger than 6.25 except for option C, which is 3. But 3 is much smaller than 6.25, so perhaps I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is reversed. Maybe it's asking for the smallest integral value of k where the equation has two real and distinct roots. No, the question says \"largest\".\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating the discriminant. Let me do it again.\n\nEquation: x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k.\n\nDiscriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac = (-5)^2 -4*1*k =25 -4k.\n\nSet D>0: 25 -4k>0 \u21924k <25 \u2192k <6.25.\n\nSo k can be 6,5,4, etc. The largest integer is 6. But since 6 isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed. But that's unlikely; maybe I'm missing a trick.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about the quadratic in terms of x, but the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, and k is a variable. So perhaps I'm supposed to find k such that for any x, the equation holds, but that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps the equation is in terms of k, but that would be rearranged.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the answer is option C)3, but that doesn't seem right because 3 is much less than 6.25.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is to find the maximum k for which the equation has real roots, not necessarily distinct. Then, k can be up to 6.25. But again, no option matches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is written incorrectly, and the equation is x\u00b2 -5x -k=0. Then discriminant is 25 +4k>0. So any k greater than -6.25 would work. So the maximum integer is unbounded. That can't be the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me see: If the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, discriminant is 25-4k. So for two distinct roots, 25-4k>0 \u2192k<6.25. So the largest integer is 6. So the correct answer is 6, but it's not among the options. So perhaps the correct option is not present, but that's not possible.\n\nWait, looking at the options again: A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. None of these are less than 6.25 except C)3. So the only possible correct answer from the options is 3, but that's not the largest possible. So perhaps the question is wrong, or the options are incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake and the discriminant should be positive, but perhaps the equation is written differently. Let me think: perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Then discriminant is 25-4k>0 \u2192k<6.25. So same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, and I'm supposed to find the maximum k where the roots are integers. But that's a different question. Let me think about that. For the roots to be integers, the discriminant must be a perfect square. So 25-4k must be a perfect square. So possible values of 25-4k: 25-4k = m\u00b2, where m is an integer. So 4k =25 -m\u00b2 \u2192k=(25 -m\u00b2)/4.\n\nWe need k to be an integer, so 25 -m\u00b2 must be divisible by 4. Let's see possible m.\n\nm must be odd because 25 is odd, and m\u00b2 will be odd if m is odd. So 25 - m\u00b2 is even, so 4 divides 25 -m\u00b2.\n\nLet me find m such that 25 -m\u00b2 is positive and divisible by 4.\n\nPossible m: m can be 1,3,5.\n\nm=1: 25-1=24 \u2192k=24/4=6.\n\nm=3: 25-9=16 \u2192k=16/4=4.\n\nm=5: 25-25=0 \u2192k=0. But 0 would give a discriminant of 0, so the roots are equal, not distinct.\n\nm=7: 25-49= -24 \u2192k= -24/4= -6. But negative k would make the equation x\u00b2 -5x -6=0. Discriminant is 25+24=49>0. But the question is about two real and distinct roots, which is satisfied, but k is -6. But the question is about the largest integral k, which would be 6.\n\nBut the options don't have 6. So perhaps the answer is 6, but it's not present. So perhaps the question intended to ask for integer roots, but that's a different scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is correct and the options are wrong. But since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps the intended answer is 6, but it's not present. So perhaps the intended setup was different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5k x +k=0. Let's compute discriminant again.\n\nDiscriminant D = ( -5k )\u00b2 -4*1*k =25k\u00b2 -4k. So for D>0: 25k\u00b2 -4k>0 \u2192k(25k -4) >0.\n\nSo when k>4/25 (\u22480.16) \u2192k>0.16. So any k>0.16, including integer k=1,2,3,...\n\nSo the largest integral value would be unbounded. So that doesn't make sense.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. According to my calculations, the correct answer is 6, but it's not an option. So perhaps the intended setup is different, or there's a mistake in the question. But given the options, I have to choose the best possible answer.\n\nWait, looking at the options again, maybe I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me read the problem once more.\n\nThe problem says: What is the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x2 - 5x + k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots?\n\nSo, the equation is definitely x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So I think the answer should be 6, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is the largest option that is less than 6.25. But all the options (A:9, B:7, C:3, D:8, E:12) are higher than 6.25 except C:3. So if I have to choose from these, the only option that satisfies k<6.25 is C:3.\n\nWait, but 3 is much less than 6.25. So perhaps the correct answer is 3, but that's not the largest possible. It's the only option that works. So perhaps the intended answer is C)3.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because 6 is larger and works. So I'm confused. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask for the smallest k, but that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant. Let me recalculate:\n\nD = b\u00b2 -4ac = (-5)^2 -4(1)(k) =25 -4k.\n\nSet D>0 \u219225-4k>0 \u21924k<25 \u2192k<6.25. So maximum integer k is 6.\n\nBut since 6 isn't an option, perhaps the problem is incorrect. But given the options, the only possible correct answer is 3, but that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options were misprinted, and the intended correct option is 6, but it's not present. So perhaps the correct answer is 6, but it's not listed.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the options again. Oh, wait, option B is 7. Let me check what happens when k=7.\n\nD=25 -4*7=25-28= -3 <0 \u2192 roots are complex. So it's invalid.\n\nSame with k=8: D=25-32= -7<0.\n\nk=9: 25-36=-11<0.\n\nk=12: 25-48=-23<0.\n\nSo all options except C)3 give negative discriminant, which means no real roots. So only k=3 works. So the largest possible k among the options is 3, which is option C.\n\nWait, but 3 is much less than 6.25. So perhaps the correct answer is 3, but that's not the maximum possible. It's the maximum among the options given.\n\nSo the correct answer is C)3.\n\n\nTo determine the largest integral value of \\( k \\) for which the quadratic equation \\( x^2 - 5x + k = 0 \\) has two real and distinct roots, we analyze the discriminant of the quadratic equation. For a general quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the discriminant is given by:\n\n\\[\nD = b^2 - 4ac\n\\]\n\nFor the equation \\( x^2 - 5x + k = 0 \\), the coefficients are \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -5 \\), and \\( c = k \\). Substituting these into the discriminant formula:\n\n\\[\nD = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(k) = 25 - 4k\n\\]\n\nFor the equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be positive:\n\n\\[\n25 - 4k > 0\n\\]\n\nSolving this inequality:\n\n\\[\n25 > 4k \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad k < \\frac{25}{4} = 6.25\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( k \\) must be less than \\( 6.25 \\). The largest integer value of \\( k \\) satisfying this condition is \\( 6 \\). However, \\( 6 \\) is not among the provided options. \n\nTo evaluate the given options:\n\n- **Option A (\\( k = 9 \\))**: Substituting \\( k = 9 \\), the discriminant becomes \\( 25 - 4(9) = -11 \\), which is negative. The equation does not have real roots.\n- **Option B (\\( k = 7 \\))**: Substituting \\( k = 7 \\), the discriminant becomes \\( 25 - 4(7) = -3 \\), which is negative. The equation does not have real roots.\n- **Option C (\\( k = 3 \\))**: Substituting \\( k = 3 \\), the discriminant becomes \\( 25 - 4(3) = 13 \\), which is positive. The equation has two real and distinct roots.\n- **Option D (\\( k = 8 \\))**: Substituting \\( k = 8 \\), the discriminant becomes \\( 25 - 4(8) = -7 \\), which is negative. The equation does not have real roots.\n- **Option E (\\( k = 12 \\))**: Substituting \\( k = 12 \\), the discriminant becomes \\( 25 - 4(12) = -23 \\), which is negative. The equation does not have real roots.\n\nAmong the options, only \\( k = 3 \\) satisfies the condition for the equation to have two real and distinct roots. Therefore, the largest integral value of \\( k \\) from the given options is:\n\n**Answer: C**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quadratic equation problem here. The question is asking for the largest integral value of 'k' such that the equation x\u00b2 -5x + k = 0 has two real and distinct roots. Hmm, I remember that for a quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, the discriminant plays a big role in determining the nature of the roots. \n\nRight, the discriminant formula is D = b\u00b2 - 4ac. If the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots. If it's zero, there's exactly one real root (a repeated root), and if it's negative, the roots are complex. So in this case, we need D to be greater than zero for two real and distinct roots.\n\nLet me plug in the values from the given equation. Here, a is 1 (since the coefficient of x\u00b2 is 1), b is -5, and c is k. So the discriminant D becomes (-5)\u00b2 - 4*(1)*(k). That's 25 minus 4k. \n\nSo for the equation to have two real and distinct roots, 25 - 4k must be greater than zero. Let me write that down: 25 -4k > 0. Solving for k, I can rearrange this inequality. Subtract 25 from both sides? Wait, no, let's do it step by step. \n\n25 -4k > 0\n=> -4k > -25\nHmm, when I divide both sides by a negative number, the inequality sign flips. So dividing both sides by -4 (and flipping the sign), I get:\nk < 25/4.\n\nWhat's 25 divided by 4? Let me calculate that. 4*6 is 24, so 25/4 is 6.25. So k must be less than 6.25. \n\nThe question is asking for the largest integral value of k. Since 6.25 is between 6 and 7, the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 6 as an option. Let me check the options again: A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Oh, wait, so maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, did I calculate the discriminant correctly? Let me double-check. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. Discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac = (-5)^2 -4*1*k = 25 -4k. That's correct. So the condition is 25-4k >0 => k <6.25. So the maximum integer is 6, but it's not among the options. Hmm, perhaps I misread the question or the options. Let me check the options again: A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. None of these are 6. So maybe I did something wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant. Let me think again. Quadratic equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant is (-5)^2 - 4*1*k = 25 -4k. So that's correct. So 25-4k>0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k <6.25. So the largest integer k can be is 6. But the options don't have 6. So perhaps the question is asking for something else, or I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not about the largest integral k where there are two real roots, but maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me check. Alternatively, perhaps the equation is written differently. Oh wait, wait! Wait a second, no. The equation is definitely x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So the discriminant is 25-4k. So yes, k must be less than 6.25.\n\nLooking at the options, the largest k less than 6.25 is 6. But the options don't have 6. So perhaps the options are wrong, or I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality direction. Let me re-express the discriminant condition.\n\nSo 25 -4k >0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k <25/4 \u2192 k <6.25. So k has to be less than 6.25. So the maximum integer k is 6. But the options don't have 6. So maybe the options are incorrect, or perhaps I'm looking at the wrong question.\n\nWait, looking at the options again: A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Hmm, none are 6. So perhaps the question was written wrong, or maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, but the discriminant is 25 -4k, and the condition is D>0, so k <6.25. So the largest integer k is 6, which isn't among the choices. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant formula. Wait, no, discriminant is b\u00b2-4ac. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So it's 25 -4k. So that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the largest k where the equation has real roots, which would include when D is zero. But wait, no, the question specifies two real and distinct roots, so D must be positive, not zero. So k must be strictly less than 6.25.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup. Let me double-check the problem statement. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So yes, a=1, b=-5, c=k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm looking for the maximum k where D is positive. So 25-4k>0 \u2192 k <6.25. So the maximum integer is 6. But the options don't have 6. So maybe the correct answer isn't listed. But that's unlikely because this is a multiple-choice question. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nWait, let me recalculate 25/4. 4*6=24, so 25/4=6.25. So yes, correct. So the maximum k is 6. So perhaps the options have a typo. But looking at the options again: A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. So none of these are less than 6.25 except C)3. Wait, 3 is less than 6.25, but it's the smallest option. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I inverted the inequality. Let me check again. The discriminant is 25-4k>0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192 4k<25 \u2192 k <25/4 \u2192 6.25. So yes, k must be less than 6.25. So the largest integer is 6, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, but maybe I should consider that the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0? No, that's not the case because the question says -5x.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is written as x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, but perhaps the discriminant is 25 +4k? No, because the formula is b\u00b2-4ac. Here, b is -5, so (-5)^2 is 25. 4ac is 4*1*k=4k. So it's 25-4k.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the maximum k where there are two real roots, but perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me think: when k is 6, D=25-24=1>0 \u2192 two real roots. When k is 7, D=25-28= -3 <0 \u2192 no real roots. So 7 is too big. So the maximum integer k is 6, which is not an option. So perhaps the options are incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the maximum k where the equation has real roots, regardless of whether they are distinct. Then, the condition would be D\u22650, so 25-4k\u22650 \u2192 k \u22646.25. So maximum integer k is 6 again. But same issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the question. Let me read it again: the quadratic equation x\u00b2 -5x +k=0 will have two real and distinct roots. So yes, D>0 is needed. So maximum k is 6. Since 6 isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's impossible for a test question. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the quadratic equation is written differently. Oh wait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0? Let me see: then a=1, b=5, c=k. Discriminant would be 25-4k>0 \u2192 same condition, k<6.25. So same result.\n\nHmm, maybe the problem is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, but perhaps I should calculate something else. Alternatively, perhaps I should check the options again. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. So none of these are less than 6.25 except C)3. But 3 is much smaller. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me think about this again. The discriminant is 25 -4k>0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k <6.25. So the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. But the options don't have 6. So perhaps the correct answer is not present, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write down the options again. Options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. So perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, perhaps the quadratic equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant D = (-5)^2 -4*1*k =25 -4k. So that's correct. So 25 -4k>0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192k <6.25.\n\nSo the maximum integer k is 6. But the options don't have 6. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that can't be. So perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, and I should find the maximum k for which the roots are real and distinct, which is k<6.25. So the maximum integer is 6.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are presented incorrectly. Let me look at the options again: A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. None of these are less than 6.25 except C)3. So perhaps the correct answer is C)3? But that can't be right because 3 is much smaller than 6.25.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the discriminant. Let me think: maybe the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Then D would be 25-4k>0 \u2192 k<6.25. Still same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, but I've mixed up the signs. Let me check: for equation ax\u00b2 +bx +c =0, discriminant is b\u00b2-4ac. So in this case, a=1, b=-5, c=k. So D= (-5)^2 -4*1*k=25-4k>0 \u2192 same as before.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is actually x\u00b2 +5x +k=0, which would give D=25-4k. So same condition. So again, maximum k is 6.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are presented in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the inequality.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try plugging the options into the equation to see which one gives a positive discriminant. Let's try each option.\n\nOption A: k=9. D=25-4*9=25-36= -11 <0 \u2192 no real roots. So not acceptable.\n\nOption B: k=7. D=25-28= -3 <0 \u2192 no real roots.\n\nOption C: k=3. D=25-12=13>0 \u2192 two real roots. So acceptable, but is it the largest possible?\n\nOption D: k=8. D=25-32= -7 <0 \u2192 no real roots.\n\nOption E: k=12. D=25-48= -23 <0 \u2192 no real roots.\n\nSo only option C gives a positive discriminant, which means two real roots. So the largest integral value of k in the options that satisfies the condition is 3. But wait, earlier calculation suggested that the maximum k is 6. But according to the options, the only k that works is 3. So perhaps the correct answer is C)3.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with my earlier reasoning. Because earlier, I thought the maximum k is 6, but in the options, the only k that works is 3. So perhaps the correct answer is 3, but that doesn't make sense because 3 is way below 6.25.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck. For option B, k=7: D=25-4*7=25-28= -3 \u2192 negative. So no real roots. So the only option that works is C)3. But that's the smallest option.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that any k less than 6.25 would work. So for example, k=6: D=25-24=1>0 \u2192 works. k=5: D=25-20=5>0 \u2192 works. So why are the options not including 6, but including 3 as the only possible value? That can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me list the discriminant for each option:\n\nA)k=9: D=25-36= -11 \u2192 no real roots.\nB)k=7: D=25-28= -3 \u2192 no real roots.\nC)k=3: D=25-12=13 \u2192 yes.\nD)k=8: D=25-32= -7 \u2192 no.\nE)k=12: D=25-48= -23 \u2192 no.\n\nSo among the options, only k=3 works. But according to my calculation, any k less than 6.25 works. So why are the other options not working? Because they're all larger than 6.25. So the only option that is less than 6.25 is C)3. So the correct answer must be C)3.\n\nWait, but that's strange because 3 is much smaller than 6.25. So perhaps the question is correct, and the options are correct, but I'm missing something. Oh wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the discriminant. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the quadratic equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant is (-5)^2 -4*(1)*(k) =25 -4k. So when k=3, D=25-12=13>0. So correct. When k=6, D=25-24=1>0. So yes, works. But 6 isn't an option, so the largest possible option given is 3. But that can't be right because 3 is not the largest possible k in the options that satisfies the condition.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the largest k where the equation has two real roots, but the options are only considering integer k's, and among the options, 3 is the only one that works. So the answer would be C)3. But that's not correct because 3 is not the maximum possible k. So perhaps the options are wrong, but I have to choose from them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant formula. Let me think again. Maybe the formula is 4ac -b\u00b2. Wait, no, the discriminant is b\u00b2-4ac. So I think I'm correct.\n\nSo, given the options, only k=3 works. So the correct answer is C)3.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quadratic equation problem here. The question is asking for the largest integral value of 'k' such that the equation x\u00b2 -5x + k = 0 has two real and distinct roots. Hmm, I remember that for a quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, the discriminant plays a big role in determining the nature of the roots. \n\nRight, the discriminant formula is D = b\u00b2 - 4ac. If the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots. If it's zero, there's exactly one real root (a repeated root), and if it's negative, the roots are complex. So in this case, we need D to be greater than zero for two real and distinct roots.\n\nLet me plug in the values from the given equation. Here, a is 1 (since the coefficient of x\u00b2 is 1), b is -5, and c is k. So the discriminant D becomes (-5)\u00b2 - 4*(1)*(k). That's 25 minus 4k. \n\nSo for the equation to have two real and distinct roots, 25 - 4k must be greater than zero. Let me write that down: 25 -4k > 0. Solving for k, I can rearrange this inequality. Subtract 25 from both sides? Wait, no, let's do it step by step. \n\n25 -4k > 0\n=> -4k > -25\nHmm, when I divide both sides by a negative number, the inequality sign flips. So dividing both sides by -4 (and flipping the sign), I get:\nk < 25/4.\n\nWhat's 25 divided by 4? Let me calculate that. 4*6 is 24, so 25/4 is 6.25. So k must be less than 6.25. \n\nThe question is asking for the largest integral value of k. Since 6.25 is between 6 and 7, the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 6 as an option. Let me check the options again: A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Oh, wait, so maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, did I calculate the discriminant correctly? Let me double-check. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. Discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac = (-5)^2 -4*1*k = 25 -4k. That's correct. So the condition is 25-4k >0 => k <6.25. So the maximum integer is 6, but it's not among the options. Hmm, perhaps I misread the question or the options. Let me check the options again: A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. None of these are 6. So maybe I did something wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant. Let me think again. Quadratic equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant is (-5)^2 - 4*1*k = 25 -4k. So that's correct. So 25-4k>0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k <6.25. So the largest integer k can be is 6. But the options don't have 6. So perhaps the question is asking for something else, or I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not about the largest integral k where there are two real roots, but maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me check. Alternatively, perhaps the equation is written differently. Oh wait, wait! Wait a second, no. The equation is definitely x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So the discriminant is 25-4k. So yes, k must be less than 6.25.\n\nLooking at the options, the largest k less than 6.25 is 6. But the options don't have 6. So perhaps the options are wrong, or I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality direction. Let me re-express the discriminant condition.\n\nSo 25 -4k >0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k <25/4 \u2192 k <6.25. So k has to be less than 6.25. So the maximum integer k is 6. But the options don't have 6. So maybe the options are incorrect, or perhaps I'm looking at the wrong question.\n\nWait, looking at the options again: A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Hmm, none are 6. So perhaps the question was written wrong, or maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, but the discriminant is 25 -4k, and the condition is D>0, so k <6.25. So the largest integer k is 6, which isn't among the choices. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant formula. Wait, no, discriminant is b\u00b2-4ac. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So it's 25 -4k. So that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the largest k where the equation has real roots, which would include when D is zero. But wait, no, the question specifies two real and distinct roots, so D must be positive, not zero. So k must be strictly less than 6.25.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup. Let me double-check the problem statement. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So yes, a=1, b=-5, c=k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm looking for the maximum k where D is positive. So 25-4k>0 \u2192 k <6.25. So the maximum integer is 6. But the options don't have 6. So maybe the correct answer isn't listed. But that's unlikely because this is a multiple-choice question. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nWait, let me recalculate 25/4. 4*6=24, so 25/4=6.25. So yes, correct. So the maximum k is 6. So perhaps the options have a typo. But looking at the options again: A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. So none of these are less than 6.25 except C)3. Wait, 3 is less than 6.25, but it's the smallest option. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I inverted the inequality. Let me check again. The discriminant is 25-4k>0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192 4k<25 \u2192 k <25/4 \u2192 6.25. So yes, k must be less than 6.25. So the largest integer is 6, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, but maybe I should consider that the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0? No, that's not the case because the question says -5x.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is written as x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, but perhaps the discriminant is 25 +4k? No, because the formula is b\u00b2-4ac. Here, b is -5, so (-5)^2 is 25. 4ac is 4*1*k=4k. So it's 25-4k.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the maximum k where there are two real roots, but perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me think: when k is 6, D=25-24=1>0 \u2192 two real roots. When k is 7, D=25-28= -3 <0 \u2192 no real roots. So 7 is too big. So the maximum integer k is 6, which is not an option. So perhaps the options are incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the maximum k where the equation has real roots, regardless of whether they are distinct. Then, the condition would be D\u22650, so 25-4k\u22650 \u2192 k \u22646.25. So maximum integer k is 6 again. But same issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the question. Let me read it again: the quadratic equation x\u00b2 -5x +k=0 will have two real and distinct roots. So yes, D>0 is needed. So maximum k is 6. Since 6 isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's impossible for a test question. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the quadratic equation is written differently. Oh wait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0? Let me see: then a=1, b=5, c=k. Discriminant would be 25-4k>0 \u2192 same condition, k<6.25. So same result.\n\nHmm, maybe the problem is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, but perhaps I should calculate something else. Alternatively, perhaps I should check the options again. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. So none of these are less than 6.25 except C)3. But 3 is much smaller. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me think about this again. The discriminant is 25 -4k>0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k <6.25. So the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. But the options don't have 6. So perhaps the correct answer is not present, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write down the options again. Options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. So perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, perhaps the quadratic equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant D = (-5)^2 -4*1*k =25 -4k. So that's correct. So 25 -4k>0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192k <6.25.\n\nSo the maximum integer k is 6. But the options don't have 6. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that can't be. So perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, and I should find the maximum k for which the roots are real and distinct, which is k<6.25.

Let me think: maybe the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Then D would be 25-4k>0 \u2192 k<6.25. Still same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, but I've mixed up the signs. Let me check: for equation ax\u00b2 +bx +c =0, discriminant is b\u00b2-4ac. So in this case, a=1, b=-5, c=k. So D= (-5)^2 -4*1*k=25-4k>0 \u2192 same as before.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is actually x\u00b2 +5x +k=0, which would give D=25-4k. So same condition. So again, maximum k is 6.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are presented in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the inequality.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try plugging the options into the equation to see which one gives a positive discriminant. Let's try each option.\n\nOption A: k=9. D=25-4*9=25-36= -11 <0 \u2192 no real roots. So not acceptable.\n\nOption B: k=7. D=25-28= -3 <0 \u2192 no real roots.\n\nOption C: k=3. D=25-12=13>0 \u2192 two real roots. So acceptable, but is it the largest possible?\n\nOption D: k=8. D=25-32= -7 <0 \u2192 no real roots.\n\nOption E: k=12. D=25-48= -23 <0 \u2192 no real roots.\n\nSo only option C gives a positive discriminant, which means two real roots. So the largest integral value of k in the options that satisfies the condition is 3. But wait, earlier calculation suggested that the maximum k is 6. But according to the options, the only k that works is 3. So perhaps the correct answer is C)3.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with my earlier reasoning. Because earlier, I thought the maximum k is 6, but in the options, the only k that works is 3. So perhaps the correct answer is 3, but that doesn't make sense because 3 is way below 6.25.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck. For option B, k=7: D=25-4*7=25-28= -3 \u2192 negative. So no real roots. So the only option that works is C)3. But that's the smallest option.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that any k less than 6.25 would work. So for example, k=6: D=25-24=1>0 \u2192 works. k=5: D=25-20=5>0 \u2192 works. So why are the options not including 6, but including 3 as the only possible value? That can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

But according to my calculation, any k less than 6.25 works. So why are the other options not working? Because they're all larger than 6.25. So the only option that is less than 6.25 is C)3. So the correct answer must be C)3.\n\nWait, but that's strange because 3 is much smaller than 6.25. So perhaps the question is correct, and the options are correct, but I'm missing something. Oh wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the discriminant. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the quadratic equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant is (-5)^2 -4*(1)*(k) =25 -4k. So when k=3, D=25-12=13>0. So correct. When k=6, D=25-24=1>0. So yes, works. But 6 isn't an option, so the largest possible option given is 3. But that can't be right because 3 is not the largest possible k in the options that satisfies the condition.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the largest k where the equation has two real roots, but the options are only considering integer k's, and among the options, 3 is the only one that works. So the answer would be C)3. But that's not correct because 3 is not the maximum possible k. So perhaps the options are wrong, but I have to choose from them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant formula. Let me think again. Maybe the formula is 4ac -b\u00b2. Wait, no, the discriminant is b\u00b2-4ac. So I think I'm correct.\n\nSo, given the options, only k=3 works. So the correct answer is C)3.\n\n\nTo determine the largest integral value of \\( k \\) for which the quadratic equation \\( x^2 - 5x + k = 0 \\) has two real and distinct roots, we analyze the discriminant of the quadratic equation.

The question is asking for the largest integer value of k such that the equation has two real and distinct roots. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nWait, I remember that for a quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, the discriminant determines the nature of the roots. The discriminant is b squared minus four a c. Right, so if the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots. If it's zero, there's exactly one real root (a repeated root), and if it's negative, the roots are complex.\n\nIn this equation, a is 1, b is -5, and c is k. So the discriminant D would be (-5) squared minus 4 times 1 times k. Let me compute that. (-5)^2 is 25, and 4*1*k is 4k. So D = 25 - 4k.\n\nWe need two real and distinct roots, so the discriminant must be greater than zero. That means 25 - 4k > 0. Let's solve for k.\n\n25 - 4k > 0  \nSubtract 25 from both sides:  \n-4k > -25  \nNow, when I divide both sides by a negative number, I have to remember to flip the inequality sign. So dividing both sides by -4 gives:  \nk < 25/4.\n\nWait, 25 divided by 4 is 6.25. So k must be less than 6.25. But the question asks for the largest integral value of k. So the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. But looking at the options, I don't see 6 as an option. The options are 9,7,3,8,12.\n\nWait a minute, did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me check my steps again.\n\nWait, the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. Discriminant D is b\u00b2-4ac, which is (-5)^2 -4*1*k =25-4k. Right. So D>0: 25-4k>0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k <25/4 \u2192 6.25.\n\nSo k must be less than 6.25. So the largest integer is 6. But the options don't have 6. So I must have messed up. Wait, maybe I misread the question.\n\nWait, the question says 'two real and distinct roots.' So my approach is correct. Let me check the options again. Oh wait, the options don't include 6. So perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant calculation.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate the discriminant. Oh no, wait, b is -5, so b squared is 25. So 25 -4k. Correct. So the discriminant is 25 -4k.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Maybe it's 'two real and distinct roots' which would require the discriminant to be positive, so D>0. So yes, k must be less than 6.25. So the largest integer is 6, but that's not an option. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, the possible answers are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. None of these are less than 6.25. So did I do something wrong? Wait, perhaps I inverted the inequality.\n\nWait, let me think again. The discriminant must be greater than zero. So 25 -4k >0. So 25>4k \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k < 25/4 which is 6.25. So k has to be less than 6.25. So the maximum integer is 6. But that's not in the options. So maybe I made a mistake in setting up the discriminant.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused a, b, c. Let me re-express the equation. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So the discriminant is (-5)^2 -4(1)(k) =25-4k. Correct. So that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is actually asking for the smallest integral value, but no, the question says largest. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the discriminant.\n\nWait, maybe I should write it as 5 squared? Wait, no, b is -5, so b squared is 25, correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Maybe the equation is written in a different form. Wait, no, the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, which is standard. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So D=25-4k.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are wrong. But that's unlikely. So perhaps I should re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, wait a minute. The question is asking for the largest integral value of k. So if k must be less than 6.25, the maximum integer is 6. But the options don't have 6. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the quadratic equation. Let me check again. Oh wait, wait, the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So the equation is correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question is about the maximum value of k where the equation has real roots, but maybe I need to consider the maximum k where the equation has at least one real root. No, the question is about two real and distinct roots, so the discriminant must be positive.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the arithmetic. Let me re-calculate.\n\n25 -4k >0  \n\u2192 25>4k  \n\u2192 4k <25  \n\u2192 k < 25/4  \n\u2192 25 divided by 4 is 6.25.\n\nYes, that's correct. So k must be less than 6.25. So the maximum integer is 6. But in the options given, the highest k less than 6.25 isn't present. So perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant formula.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's test the options. Let's plug each option into D and see if it's positive.\n\nOption A) k=9: D=25-4*9=25-36= -11. So negative, no real roots. So not acceptable.\n\nOption B) k=7: D=25-28= -3. Still negative. So no real roots.\n\nOption C) k=3: D=25-12=13. Positive. So two real roots. But this is a lower value, so maybe another option gives a higher k.\n\nWait, but wait, the options go up to 12, which is higher than 6.25. So none of the options are less than 6.25. That can't be right. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, no, the question is correct. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the inequality. Let's think again.\n\nD =25-4k >0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192 k <25/4=6.25.\n\nSo k must be less than 6.25. So the maximum integer k is 6. But 6 isn't an option. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0? No, the question says x\u00b2 -5x +k=0.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the options are incorrect, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the maximum k for which there are two real roots, but the question says two real and distinct roots, which requires D>0.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is miswritten. Let me re-examine the options. Oh wait, looking back, option D is 8. Let's plug k=8 into the discriminant. 25 -4*8=25-32= -7. That's negative, so no real roots. So k=8 is not acceptable.\n\nOption E is 12: D=25-48= -23. Also negative.\n\nWait, then the only options that give positive D are k=3, which is option C, and maybe others if there are any.\n\nWait, let's check option B, k=7. D=25-28= -3. Negative.\n\nOption A, k=9: D=-11. Negative.\n\nOption D, k=8: D=-7. Negative.\n\nSo only option C (k=3) gives a positive discriminant, so two real and distinct roots. But the question is asking for the largest integral value of k. So 3 is the maximum among the options, but 3 is less than 6.25. Wait, but what about the other options? Are any of them less than 6.25?\n\nLooking at the options, the other options are 3, 7,8,9,12. The only one less than 6.25 is 3. So the maximum k is 6, but since 6 isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer is 3.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the largest k. So among the given options, the largest possible k that satisfies k<6.25 is 3? Because 3 is less than 6.25, but 7,8,9,12 are all higher, but their discriminant is negative. So the only possible k from the options that give a positive discriminant is 3.\n\nSo the answer would be C)3.\n\nBut wait, I'm confused because the options don't include 6. So perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant. Alternatively, maybe the equation is written differently. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the discriminant formula wrong. The formula is b\u00b2-4ac. So in this case, a=1, b=-5, c=k. So yes, D=25-4k. Correct.\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer is C)3. But I'm a bit confused because according to the math, k can be up to 6.25, but the options don't have that. So the next best is 3.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So to have two distinct real roots, the discriminant must be positive. So 25 -4k >0 \u2192 k <25/4=6.25.\n\nSo the maximum integer k is 6. But since 6 isn't an option, the next lower option is 3. So the answer must be C)3.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, let me think of it another way. Let's compute the discriminant for each option and see which one is the largest k that gives a positive D.\n\nOption A: k=9 \u2192 D=25-36= -11 \u2192 negative \u2192 no good.\n\nOption B: k=7 \u2192 D=25-28= -3 \u2192 negative.\n\nOption C: k=3 \u2192 D=25-12=13 \u2192 positive. So acceptable.\n\nOption D: k=8 \u2192 D=25-32= -7 \u2192 negative.\n\nOption E: k=12 \u2192 D=25-48= -23 \u2192 negative.\n\nSo the only option that gives a positive discriminant is C)3. So the answer is C.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the largest k. But according to the math, 3 is the only option that works. So the answer must be C)3.\n",

The question is asking for the largest integer value of k such that the equation has two real and distinct roots. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nWait, I remember that for a quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, the discriminant determines the nature of the roots. The discriminant is b squared minus four a c. Right, so if the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots. If it's zero, there's exactly one real root (a repeated root), and if it's negative, the roots are complex.\n\nIn this equation, a is 1, b is -5, and c is k. So the discriminant D would be (-5) squared minus 4 times 1 times k. Let me compute that. (-5)^2 is 25, and 4*1*k is 4k.

If the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots. If it's zero, one real root, and if negative, complex roots.\n\nSo in this equation, a is 1, b is -5, and c is k. Let me write down the discriminant: D = (-5)\u00b2 -4*(1)*k. That simplifies to 25 -4k. \n\nFor two distinct real roots, the discriminant must be greater than zero. So 25 -4k > 0. Let me solve this inequality.\n\n25 -4k > 0\n=> 25 >4k\nDivide both sides by 4: 25/4 >k\nWhich is 6.25 >k. So k must be less than 6.25.\n\nBut the question asks for the largest integral value of k. So the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 6. The options are 9,7,3,8,12. Hmm, did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, let me double-check. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant is (-5)^2 -4*1*k =25-4k. Oh wait, no, I think I did that correctly. So 25-4k>0 \u2192 k <25/4 \u2192 k <6.25. So the maximum integer less than 6.25 is 6. But 6 is not one of the options. Did I miscalculate something?\n\nWait, the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Oh, wait, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the discriminant. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant is b\u00b2-4ac = (-5)^2 -4*(1)*k =25 -4k. Right. So 25-4k must be greater than zero.\n\nSo 25 -4k >0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k <25/4 \u2192 6.25.\n\nSo the maximum integer k can be is 6. But the options don't have 6. So I must have made a mistake here. Let me check the question again.\n\nWait, the question says \"integral value of k\". So maybe the options are wrong? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Hmm, none are 6. So perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant calculation.\n\nWait, could the equation have been written differently? Like maybe the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0? No, the question says x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So I think I did that right.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I'm supposed to find the maximum k such that the equation has two real roots. So k must be less than 6.25, so 6 is the maximum integer. But since 6 is not an option, maybe the options are incorrect, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking again, maybe I miscalculated the discriminant. Let me recalculate. b is -5, so b squared is 25. 4ac is 4*1*k=4k. So 25 -4k >0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192 k <25/4=6.25.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the quadratic equation having two real roots, not necessarily distinct. But no, the question says two real and distinct roots, so discriminant must be positive, not zero.\n\nWait, perhaps I read the equation wrong. Let me check again: x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. Yep.\n\nHmm, none of the options are 6. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But that can't be. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait another thought: maybe the quadratic is in the form ax\u00b2 +bx +c, but perhaps the signs are different. Wait, the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant is 25 -4k. So correct.\n\nSo maybe the options are wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the question is to find the maximum value where the equation has real roots, regardless of being distinct. Then discriminant >=0. So k <=6.25. So the maximum integer would be 6. But again, 6 is not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality direction. Let me check again.\n\n25 -4k >0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k <6.25. So yes, that's correct.\n\nLooking at the options, the highest number less than 6.25 would be 6, but since it's not there, maybe the next lower is 3, but that's way lower. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I inverted the discriminant. Let me think: D = b\u00b2 -4ac.\n\nWait, in this case, a=1, b= -5, c=k. So D= (-5)^2 -4*1*k =25-4k. That's correct.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the question is about the maximum value of k, but the options are in such a way that the correct answer isn't present, but perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the discriminant being positive, but something else.\n\nWait, maybe the equation is written as x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Then discriminant would be 25-4k. So same as before. So same result. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. Oh, I'm confident that's correct. So the discriminant is 25 -4k.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is to find the largest integer k where the equation has two real roots, which could be the same or different. So discriminant >=0.\n\nIn that case, 25 -4k >=0 \u2192 k <=6.25. So the maximum integer is 6. Still not in the options.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, the closest one less than 6.25 is 3, but that's option C. But 3 is much smaller. So perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation. Maybe it's x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Let's see. Then discriminant is 25-4k. So same as before. So same conclusion.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. The options don't include 6, which is the correct answer. So perhaps the question was miswritten, or I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait, let me think again. Did I miscalculate 25/4? 25 divided by 4 is 6.25. So yes, correct.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, but the user made a typo, and perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Let me try that. Then discriminant is 25 -4k. So same as before. Still, same issue.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula. Let me write the discriminant again.\n\nYes, D = b^2 -4ac. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So D = (-5)^2 -4*1*k =25-4k.\n\nSo D must be positive, so 25-4k>0 \u2192 k <6.25.\n\nSo the largest integer k is 6. But options don't have 6. So perhaps the correct answer is not present, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, but I misread the coefficients. Wait, the equation is correct as given.\n\nWait, looking at the options again: A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the quadratic equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, and perhaps the question is asking for the maximum k such that the equation has two real roots, not necessarily distinct. So D >=0.\n\nSo 25-4k >=0 \u2192 k <=6.25 \u2192 maximum integer is 6.\n\nBut again, 6 is not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is not there, but that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is different. Let me read again.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, and the question is to find the largest integer k for which the equation has two real and distinct roots. So discriminant must be positive.\n\nHmm, perhaps the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Let me recalculate in that case.\n\nWait, if the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0, then a=1, b=5, c=k. Discriminant is 25 -4k. So same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is written as x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, but I've been looking for the discriminant in the wrong way. Oh wait, no, the discriminant is correct.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again. The options are 9,7,3,8,12. None of these are less than 6.25 except 3. So perhaps the correct answer isn't there, but the closest lower is 3, but that's option C.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. Perhaps I should look for the maximum value of k where D is positive. So k must be less than 6.25. So 6 is the maximum integer. But since that's not an option, perhaps the options are incorrect, or perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is written as x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, and I'm supposed to find the maximum integer k such that the equation has real roots, but the options are higher than 6.25. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, no, the question is clear: two real and distinct roots, so D must be positive. So k must be less than 6.25.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, but the signs are different. For example, if the equation was x\u00b2 +5x +k=0, the discriminant would be 25-4k. So same as before.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it differently. Let me consider each option and see if it gives a positive discriminant.\n\nOption A: k=9 \u2192 D=25-4*9=25-36= -11 \u2192 negative. So no real roots.\n\nOption B: k=7 \u2192 D=25-28= -3 \u2192 negative. No real roots.\n\nOption C: k=3 \u2192 D=25-12=13 \u2192 positive. So two distinct real roots.\n\nOption D: k=8 \u2192 D=25-32= -7 \u2192 negative. No real roots.\n\nOption E: k=12 \u2192 D=25-48= -23 \u2192 negative. No real roots.\n\nSo the only option that gives a positive discriminant is option C, k=3. But the question is asking for the largest integral value of k. So according to this, the largest possible is 3, but wait, the options have 9,7, etc., which are higher than 3, but when k is higher, the discriminant becomes negative.\n\nWait, but according to this, the largest k that works is 3. But earlier, I thought the maximum is 6.25, so 6 is the largest integer. But since 6 isn't an option, the next is 3.\n\nWait, but in this case, the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. So when I tested option C, k=3, the discriminant was positive. But for the other options, the discriminant is negative. So 3 is the only option that works. So the largest integral k is 3. But according to my earlier calculation, the maximum k is 6.25, so 6 is the largest integer. But since 6 isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer is C)3.\n\nWait, but why is this the case? Because among the given options, only k=3 gives a positive discriminant. So the largest possible k among the options is 3.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 6 isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Alternatively, perhaps the question is correct, and the options are wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I should re-examine the discriminant calculation. Let's try each option again.\n\nOption A: k=9 \u2192 D=25 -4*9=25-36= -11 \u2192 negative.\n\nOption B: k=7 \u2192 D=25-28= -3 \u2192 negative.\n\nOption C: k=3 \u2192 D=25-12=13 \u2192 positive.\n\nOption D: k=8 \u2192 D=25-32= -7 \u2192 negative.\n\nOption E: k=12 \u2192 D=25-48= -23 \u2192 negative.\n\nSo only option C works. So the largest integral value of k is 3. But wait, the maximum allowed is 6.25, so any integer below that should work, but the options don't have higher numbers. So the answer must be C)3.\n\nBut wait, I'm confused because earlier I thought the maximum k is 6, but that's not an option. So perhaps the question intended to have the options as higher numbers, but perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, but the question is asking for the maximum k where the equation has two real roots, not necessarily distinct. So discriminant >=0 \u2192 k <=6.25. So the maximum integer is 6. But 6 isn't an option. So perhaps the intended answer is 7, but that's option B, but when k=7, D is negative.\n\nHmm, I'm really stuck here. The only option that gives a positive discriminant is C)3. So the answer must be C.\n\nBut I'm not confident because earlier I thought the maximum k is 6.25, but since 6 isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer is 3.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this quadratic equation problem to solve. The question is asking for the largest integral value of 'k' such that the equation x\u00b2 -5x +k =0 has two real and distinct roots. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nHmm, I remember that for a quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c =0, the discriminant determines the nature of the roots. The discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. If the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots. If it's zero, one real root, and if negative, complex roots.\n\nSo in this equation, a is 1, b is -5, and c is k. Let me write down the discriminant: D = (-5)\u00b2 -4*(1)*k. That simplifies to 25 -4k. \n\nFor two distinct real roots, the discriminant must be greater than zero. So 25 -4k > 0. Let me solve this inequality.\n\n25 -4k > 0\n=> 25 >4k\nDivide both sides by 4: 25/4 >k\nWhich is 6.25 >k. So k must be less than 6.25.\n\nBut the question asks for the largest integral value of k.

Let me consider each option and see if it gives a positive discriminant.\n\nOption A: k=9 \u2192 D=25-4*9=25-36= -11 \u2192 negative. So no real roots.\n\nOption B: k=7 \u2192 D=25-28= -3 \u2192 negative. No real roots.\n\nOption C: k=3 \u2192 D=25-12=13 \u2192 positive.

No real roots.\n\nSo the only option that gives a positive discriminant is option C, k=3. But the question is asking for the largest integral value of k. So according to this, the largest possible is 3, but wait, the options have 9,7, etc., which are higher than 3, but when k is higher, the discriminant becomes negative.\n\nWait, but according to this, the largest k that works is 3. But earlier, I thought the maximum is 6.25, so 6 is the largest integer. But since 6 isn't an option, the next is 3.\n\nWait, but in this case, the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. So when I tested option C, k=3, the discriminant was positive. But for the other options, the discriminant is negative. So 3 is the only option that works. So the largest integral k is 3. But according to my earlier calculation, the maximum k is 6.25, so 6 is the largest integer. But since 6 isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer is C)3.\n\nWait, but why is this the case? Because among the given options, only k=3 gives a positive discriminant. So the largest possible k among the options is 3.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 6 isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Alternatively, perhaps the question is correct, and the options are wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I should re-examine the discriminant calculation. Let's try each option again.\n\nOption A: k=9 \u2192 D=25 -4*9=25-36= -11 \u2192 negative.\n\nOption B: k=7 \u2192 D=25-28= -3 \u2192 negative.\n\nOption C: k=3 \u2192 D=25-12=13 \u2192 positive.\n\nOption D: k=8 \u2192 D=25-32= -7 \u2192 negative.\n\nOption E: k=12 \u2192 D=25-48= -23 \u2192 negative.\n\nSo only option C works. So the largest integral value of k is 3. But wait, the maximum allowed is 6.25, so any integer below that should work, but the options don't have higher numbers. So the answer must be C)3.\n\nBut wait, I'm confused because earlier I thought the maximum k is 6, but that's not an option. So perhaps the question intended to have the options as higher numbers, but perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, but the question is asking for the maximum k where the equation has two real roots, not necessarily distinct. So discriminant >=0 \u2192 k <=6.25. So the maximum integer is 6. But 6 isn't an option. So perhaps the intended answer is 7, but that's option B, but when k=7, D is negative.\n\nHmm, I'm really stuck here. The only option that gives a positive discriminant is C)3. So the answer must be C.\n\nBut I'm not confident because earlier I thought the maximum k is 6.25, but since 6 isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer is 3.\n\n\nTo determine the largest integral value of \\( k \\) for which the quadratic equation \\( x^2 - 5x + k = 0 \\) has two real and distinct roots, we analyze the discriminant of the quadratic equation. For a general quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the discriminant is given by:\n\n\\[\nD = b^2 - 4ac\n\\]\n\nIn this case, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -5 \\), and \\( c = k \\). Substituting these values, the discriminant becomes:\n\n\\[\nD = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(k) = 25 - 4k\n\\]\n\nFor the equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be positive:\n\n\\[\n25 - 4k > 0\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( k \\):\n\n\\[\n25 > 4k \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad k < \\frac{25}{4} = 6.25\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( k \\) must be less than \\( 6.25 \\). The largest integer less than \\( 6.25 \\) is \\( 6 \\). However, \\( 6 \\) is not among the provided options.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quadratic equation problem here. The question is asking for the largest integer value of 'k' such that the equation x\u00b2 -5x + k = 0 has two real and distinct roots. Hmm, I remember from school that quadratic equations have something to do with the discriminant. Wait, right, the discriminant determines the nature of the roots.\n\nThe standard form of a quadratic equation is ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0. In this case, a is 1, b is -5, and c is k. The discriminant is b\u00b2 - 4ac. For the equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be positive. So I need to calculate the discriminant and set it greater than zero.\n\nLet me compute that. b is -5, so b squared is (-5)\u00b2 = 25. Then 4ac is 4 * 1 * k, which is 4k. So the discriminant is 25 - 4k. And for two real and distinct roots, this should be greater than zero. So 25 -4k > 0.\n\nLet me solve this inequality. Subtract 25 from both sides: -4k > -25. Then divide both sides by -4. Wait, I have to remember that when I divide or multiply both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the direction of the inequality sign flips. So dividing both sides by -4 gives k < (-25)/(-4) \u2192 k < 25/4.\n\nWhat's 25 divided by 4? That's 6.25. So k must be less than 6.25. But the question is asking for the largest integral value of k. So the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 6 as an option. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nWait a second, did I make a mistake? Let me double-check my steps. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k = 0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. Discriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac = 25 -4k. For two distinct real roots, D>0 \u2192 25-4k>0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k <25/4 \u2192 6.25.\n\nHmm, so k must be less than 6.25. The largest integer less than that is 6, but that's not an option. The options given are 3,7,8,9,12. Oh wait, wait, maybe I messed up the discriminant. Let me think again. Oh wait, wait, maybe the equation is x\u00b2 -5x + k = 0, so the discriminant is (-5)^2 -4*1*k \u2192 25 -4k. So yeah, same as before.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated 25/4. 4 times 6 is 24, so 25/4 is 6.25. So k has to be less than 6.25. So the maximum integer is 6. But looking at the options, I don't see 6. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. So none of these are 6. Hmm, that can't be right. Did I misread the question?\n\nWait, the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the discriminant. Let me check the quadratic again. It's x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant is (-5)^2 -4*(1)*(k) \u2192 25 -4k. Right. So 25-4k>0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k <6.25. So k must be less than 6.25.\n\nBut the options don't have 6. The next possible is 6 isn't present. So what's the maximum integer in the options that is less than 6.25? Let's see the options again: A is 9, which is way above 6.25. B is 7, which is higher than 6.25. C is 3, which is lower. D is 8, which is higher. E is 12, way higher.\n\nWait, that suggests that none of the options are correct, but that can't be the case. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Alternatively, maybe the question was looking for the maximum k for which the equation has two real roots, but perhaps I miscalculated the discriminant.\n\nWait, maybe the equation was written differently. Let me recheck: x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant is correct.\n\nHmm, but according to this, the maximum integer k is 6, but it's not an option. So perhaps I need to reevaluate.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is to have two real and distinct roots, which requires discriminant positive. So if the options don't include 6, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options. But that's unlikely; perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the quadratic is written as x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So the discriminant is (\u22125)^2 \u22124(1)(k) =25\u22124k. So 25\u22124k>0 \u21924k <25 \u2192k <6.25. So the maximum integer is 6, but it's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the equation. Let me check: the equation is x squared minus 5x plus k equals zero. So yeah, a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the options have a typo, but I'll have to work with what's given. Let me look at the options again. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me re-solve the inequality.\n\n25 -4k >0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192 4k <25 \u2192k <25/4 \u2192 6.25.\n\nSo the maximum integer is 6, but it's not in the options. So perhaps I need to choose the largest integer less than 6.25 that's in the options. The options are 3,7,8,9,12.\n\nWait, 3 is less than 6.25, but 7 is higher. So if I plug in k=7, what happens? Let's compute the discriminant: 25 -4*7=25-28= -3. Which is negative. So the equation would have no real roots. So 7 is too big.\n\nSimilarly, for k=8: 25-32= -7. Still negative.\n\nk=9: 25-36=-11. Negative.\n\nk=12: 25-48= -23. Also negative.\n\nSo all options except C (k=3) are above 6.25 and would give negative discriminant. So the only option that is less than 6.25 is C)3. But 3 is much lower than 6.25. So the maximum k in options is 3, but that's not the maximum possible. But wait, perhaps the question is looking for the largest integer in the options where the equation still has real roots. Let me see.\n\nWait, but the options don't include 6, so perhaps the answer is 3, but that's not the maximum possible. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant sign.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps I mixed up the inequality. So 25-4k >0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k <6.25. So any k less than 6.25 is acceptable. So among the options, the largest k less than 6.25 is not present. So perhaps the question is wrong, but since that's not possible, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is written differently. Oh wait, the question says 'integral value of k'\u2014so perhaps I need to consider that the maximum integer k is 6, but that's not an option. Therefore, perhaps the options have a typo, but the correct answer isn't among them. But that's not the case here, as I must choose from the given options.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misread the problem. Let me read it again. It says, \"the quadratic equation x\u00b2 -5x +k =0 will have two real and distinct roots.\" So my approach was correct. So the only option that's less than 6.25 is C)3. But that's not the largest possible. Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the maximum k where the equation has real roots, but the options don't include 6, so perhaps I need to pick the next possible lower option.\n\nWait, but all the other options are higher than 6.25. So only option C is 3, which is less than 6.25. So the equation will have two real roots for k=3. But the question asks for the largest possible integer k. Since 6 isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is 6, but it's not present. So perhaps the correct answer is 6, but since it's not an option, the question is flawed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again. Oh wait, wait a second. Did I mix up the signs? Let me recheck: The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac = (-5)^2 -4*(1)*(k) =25 -4k. So for two distinct real roots, D>0 \u219225-4k>0 \u21924k<25 \u2192k<6.25. So yeah, same as before.\n\nSo the maximum integer is 6, but it's not an option. So perhaps the answer intended is 6, but it's not given, so perhaps the options are wrong. But I have to choose from the given options.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again. 25 -4k >0 \u21924k <25 \u2192k <6.25. So the maximum integer k is 6, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem was written incorrectly. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The question says, \"the quadratic equation x\u00b2 -5x +k =0 will have two real and distinct roots.\" So that's correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the options are in error, but perhaps I should look again. Let me see the options again: A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the smallest integral value of k, but no, it says the largest. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the discriminant condition. Let me think: For two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be positive. So if D>0, then k<6.25.\n\nSo if the options don't have 6, perhaps the correct answer is 6, but it's not present. So perhaps the problem expects me to choose the next lower integer, but in the options, 3 is the only one less than 6.25, but that's the smallest option. Alternatively, perhaps the options are wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the discriminant formula. Oh wait, the formula is D= b\u00b2 -4ac. So in this case, yes, 25 -4k. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. According to the calculations, the correct answer isn't in the options. But perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again: 25 -4k >0 \u21924k <25 \u2192k <6.25. So the largest integer is 6. So the options don't include 6. So perhaps the intended answer is 6, but it's not present. But the options given don't have 6.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup of a, b, c. Let me double-check. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So D= (-5)^2 -4*(1)*(k) \u219225 -4k. So yes, correct.\n\nSo given that, the maximum k is 6, but it's not in the options. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.\n\nWait, another possibility: maybe I was supposed to set the discriminant to be greater than or equal to zero, but that's for real and equal roots. No, no, two real and distinct roots require D>0.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check each option's discriminant.\n\nLet me compute the discriminant for each option:\n\nOption A: k=9 \u2192 D=25 -4*9 =25-36= -11 <0 \u2192 no real roots.\n\nOption B: k=7 \u219225-28= -3 <0 \u2192 no real roots.\n\nOption C: k=3 \u219225-12=13>0 \u2192 two real roots.\n\nOption D: k=8 \u219225-32=-7 <0 \u2192 no real roots.\n\nOption E: k=12 \u219225-48= -23 <0 \u2192 no real roots.\n\nSo only option C (k=3) gives a positive discriminant, so the equation has two real roots. The others give negative discriminant, so no real roots.\n\nBut the question is asking for the largest integral k. So among the options, the largest possible k that still allows real roots is 3. Because 3 is the only option where D is positive.\n\nWait, but 3 is the smallest possible k in the options. So perhaps the options are in order, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read again: \"the largest integral value of k\". So the largest k possible is 6, but it's not in the options. So the next possible is 3. But wait, why is 3 the only option where D is positive?\n\nHmm, perhaps the options are incorrect, but according to the calculations, the only option that works is C)3. But the question is asking for the largest k, which would be 6. But since 6 is not an option, the next possible is 3.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that the options are wrong. Let me see: perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. No, the question says x\u00b2-5x +k=0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x -k=0, but that's not what the question says. So no.\n\nSo I think I have to choose the only option that gives a positive discriminant, which is option C)3. So the correct answer would be C)3.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quadratic equation problem here. The question is asking for the largest integer value of 'k' such that the equation x\u00b2 -5x + k = 0 has two real and distinct roots. Hmm, I remember from school that quadratic equations have something to do with the discriminant. Wait, right, the discriminant determines the nature of the roots.\n\nThe standard form of a quadratic equation is ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0. In this case, a is 1, b is -5, and c is k. The discriminant is b\u00b2 - 4ac. For the equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be positive. So I need to calculate the discriminant and set it greater than zero.\n\nLet me compute that. b is -5, so b squared is (-5)\u00b2 = 25. Then 4ac is 4 * 1 * k, which is 4k. So the discriminant is 25 - 4k. And for two real and distinct roots, this should be greater than zero. So 25 -4k > 0.\n\nLet me solve this inequality. Subtract 25 from both sides: -4k > -25. Then divide both sides by -4. Wait, I have to remember that when I divide or multiply both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the direction of the inequality sign flips. So dividing both sides by -4 gives k < (-25)/(-4) \u2192 k < 25/4.\n\nWhat's 25 divided by 4? That's 6.25. So k must be less than 6.25. But the question is asking for the largest integral value of k. So the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 6 as an option. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nWait a second, did I make a mistake? Let me double-check my steps. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k = 0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. Discriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac = 25 -4k. For two distinct real roots, D>0 \u2192 25-4k>0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k <25/4 \u2192 6.25.\n\nHmm, so k must be less than 6.25. The largest integer less than that is 6, but that's not an option. The options given are 3,7,8,9,12. Oh wait, wait, maybe I messed up the discriminant. Let me think again. Oh wait, wait, maybe the equation is x\u00b2 -5x + k = 0, so the discriminant is (-5)^2 -4*1*k \u2192 25 -4k. So yeah, same as before.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated 25/4. 4 times 6 is 24, so 25/4 is 6.25. So k has to be less than 6.25. So the maximum integer is 6. But looking at the options, I don't see 6. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. So none of these are 6. Hmm, that can't be right. Did I misread the question?\n\nWait, the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the discriminant. Let me check the quadratic again. It's x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant is (-5)^2 -4*(1)*(k) \u2192 25 -4k. Right. So 25-4k>0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k <6.25. So k must be less than 6.25.\n\nBut the options don't have 6. The next possible is 6 isn't present.

D is 8, which is higher. E is 12, way higher.\n\nWait, that suggests that none of the options are correct, but that can't be the case. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

So perhaps I need to choose the largest integer less than 6.25 that's in the options. The options are 3,7,8,9,12.\n\nWait, 3 is less than 6.25, but 7 is higher. So if I plug in k=7, what happens? Let's compute the discriminant: 25 -4*7=25-28= -3. Which is negative. So the equation would have no real roots. So 7 is too big.\n\nSimilarly, for k=8: 25-32= -7. Still negative.\n\nk=9: 25-36=-11. Negative.\n\nk=12: 25-48= -23. Also negative.\n\nSo all options except C (k=3) are above 6.25 and would give negative discriminant. So the only option that is less than 6.25 is C)3. But 3 is much lower than 6.25. So the maximum k in options is 3, but that's not the maximum possible. But wait, perhaps the question is looking for the largest integer in the options where the equation still has real roots. Let me see.\n\nWait, but the options don't include 6, so perhaps the answer is 3, but that's not the maximum possible. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant sign.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps I mixed up the inequality. So 25-4k >0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k <6.25. So any k less than 6.25 is acceptable. So among the options, the largest k less than 6.25 is not present. So perhaps the question is wrong, but since that's not possible, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is written differently. Oh wait, the question says 'integral value of k'\u2014so perhaps I need to consider that the maximum integer k is 6, but that's not an option. Therefore, perhaps the options have a typo, but the correct answer isn't among them. But that's not the case here, as I must choose from the given options.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misread the problem. Let me read it again. It says, \"the quadratic equation x\u00b2 -5x +k =0 will have two real and distinct roots.\" So my approach was correct. So the only option that's less than 6.25 is C)3. But that's not the largest possible. Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the maximum k where the equation has real roots, but the options don't include 6, so perhaps I need to pick the next possible lower option.\n\nWait, but all the other options are higher than 6.25. So only option C is 3, which is less than 6.25. So the equation will have two real roots for k=3. But the question asks for the largest possible integer k. Since 6 isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is 6, but it's not present. So perhaps the correct answer is 6, but since it's not an option, the question is flawed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again. Oh wait, wait a second. Did I mix up the signs? Let me recheck: The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac = (-5)^2 -4*(1)*(k) =25 -4k. So for two distinct real roots, D>0 \u219225-4k>0 \u21924k<25 \u2192k<6.25. So yeah, same as before.\n\nSo the maximum integer is 6, but it's not an option. So perhaps the answer intended is 6, but it's not given, so perhaps the options are wrong. But I have to choose from the given options.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again. 25 -4k >0 \u21924k <25 \u2192k <6.25. So the maximum integer k is 6, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem was written incorrectly. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The question says, \"the quadratic equation x\u00b2 -5x +k =0 will have two real and distinct roots.\" So that's correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the options are in error, but perhaps I should look again. Let me see the options again: A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the smallest integral value of k, but no, it says the largest. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the discriminant condition. Let me think: For two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be positive. So if D>0, then k<6.25.\n\nSo if the options don't have 6, perhaps the correct answer is 6, but it's not present. So perhaps the problem expects me to choose the next lower integer, but in the options, 3 is the only one less than 6.25, but that's the smallest option. Alternatively, perhaps the options are wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the discriminant formula. Oh wait, the formula is D= b\u00b2 -4ac. So in this case, yes, 25 -4k. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. According to the calculations, the correct answer isn't in the options. But perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again: 25 -4k >0 \u21924k <25 \u2192k <6.25. So the largest integer is 6. So the options don't include 6. So perhaps the intended answer is 6, but it's not present. But the options given don't have 6.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup of a, b, c. Let me double-check. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So D= (-5)^2 -4*(1)*(k) \u219225 -4k. So yes, correct.\n\nSo given that, the maximum k is 6, but it's not in the options. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.\n\nWait, another possibility: maybe I was supposed to set the discriminant to be greater than or equal to zero, but that's for real and equal roots. No, no, two real and distinct roots require D>0.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check each option's discriminant.\n\nLet me compute the discriminant for each option:\n\nOption A: k=9 \u2192 D=25 -4*9 =25-36= -11 <0 \u2192 no real roots.\n\nOption B: k=7 \u219225-28= -3 <0 \u2192 no real roots.\n\nOption C: k=3 \u219225-12=13>0 \u2192 two real roots.\n\nOption D: k=8 \u219225-32=-7 <0 \u2192 no real roots.\n\nOption E: k=12 \u219225-48= -23 <0 \u2192 no real roots.\n\nSo only option C (k=3) gives a positive discriminant, so the equation has two real roots. The others give negative discriminant, so no real roots.\n\nBut the question is asking for the largest integral k. So among the options, the largest possible k that still allows real roots is 3. Because 3 is the only option where D is positive.\n\nWait, but 3 is the smallest possible k in the options. So perhaps the options are in order, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read again: \"the largest integral value of k\". So the largest k possible is 6, but it's not in the options. So the next possible is 3. But wait, why is 3 the only option where D is positive?\n\nHmm, perhaps the options are incorrect, but according to the calculations, the only option that works is C)3. But the question is asking for the largest k, which would be 6. But since 6 is not an option, the next possible is 3.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that the options are wrong. Let me see: perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. No, the question says x\u00b2-5x +k=0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x -k=0, but that's not what the question says. So no.\n\nSo I think I have to choose the only option that gives a positive discriminant, which is option C)3. So the correct answer would be C)3.\n\n\nTo determine the largest integral value of \\( k \\) for which the quadratic equation \\( x^2 - 5x + k = 0 \\) has two real and distinct roots, we analyze the discriminant of the quadratic equation. The standard form of a quadratic equation is \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), where the discriminant is given by \\( D = b^2 - 4ac \\). For the equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be positive (\\( D > 0 \\)).\n\n### Step 1: Identify coefficients\nFor the given equation \\( x^2 - 5x + k = 0 \\):\n- \\( a = 1 \\)\n- \\( b = -5 \\)\n- \\( c = k \\)\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the discriminant\nThe discriminant is:\n\\[\nD = b^2 - 4ac = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(k) = 25 - 4k\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Set the discriminant greater than zero\nFor two real and distinct roots:\n\\[\n25 - 4k > 0\n\\]\n\\[\n4k < 25\n\\]\n\\[\nk < \\frac{25}{4} = 6.25\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Determine the largest integral value of \\( k \\)\nThe largest integer less than \\( 6.25 \\) is \\( 6 \\). However, \\( 6 \\) is not among the given options. Therefore, we must evaluate the options provided to find the largest value of \\( k \\) that satisfies \\( k < 6.25 \\).\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate the options\n- **Option A (\\( k = 9 \\))**: \\( D = 25 - 4(9) = 25 - 36 = -11 \\) (negative, no real roots).\n- **Option B (\\( k = 7 \\))**: \\( D = 25 - 4(7) = 25 - 28 = -3 \\) (negative, no real roots).\n- **Option C (\\( k = 3 \\))**: \\( D = 25 - 4(3) = 25 - 12 = 13 \\) (positive, two real roots).\n- **Option D (\\( k = 8 \\))**: \\( D = 25 - 4(8) = 25 - 32 = -7 \\) (negative, no real roots).\n- **Option E (\\( k = 12 \\))**: \\( D = 25 - 4(12) = 25 - 48 = -23 \\) (negative, no real roots).\n\n### Step 6: Select the correct answer\nAmong the options, only \\( k = 3 \\) (Option C) results in a positive discriminant, ensuring two real and distinct roots. Although \\( k = 3 \\) is not the largest possible value of \\( k \\) (which would be \\( 6 \\)), it is the largest value in the given options that satisfies the condition.\n\n**Answer: C**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this quadratic equation question to solve. The equation is x squared minus 5x plus k equals zero, and I need to find the largest integer value of k for which the equation has two real and distinct roots. Hmm, I remember that for a quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, the discriminant plays a big role in determining the nature of the roots. Oh right, the discriminant is b squared minus 4ac. \n\nWait, what does the discriminant tell us again? Oh yeah, if the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots. If it's zero, there's exactly one real root (a repeated root), and if it's negative, the roots are complex and not real. So in this case, we need the discriminant to be positive because we want two real and distinct roots.\n\nLet me write down the equation again: x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. Comparing to ax\u00b2 + bx + c =0, a is 1, b is -5, and c is k. So the discriminant D is b\u00b2 -4ac. Plugging in the values, D = (-5)\u00b2 -4*(1)*k. That's 25 -4k.\n\nSo for two distinct real roots, D must be greater than zero. So 25 -4k > 0. Let me solve this inequality. \n\n25 -4k > 0\nSubtract 25 from both sides: -4k > -25\nDivide both sides by -4. Wait, I remember that when you divide or multiply both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the direction of the inequality sign flips. So dividing both sides by -4 gives k < 25/4.\n\nWhat's 25 divided by 4? 25/4 is 6.25. So k must be less than 6.25. But the question asks for the largest integral value of k. So the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 6 as an option. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Oh, wait, so none of the options are 6. Did I make a mistake in my calculation?\n\nWait, let me recheck. The discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. b is -5, so b squared is 25. 4ac is 4*1*k=4k. So discriminant is 25 -4k. Correct. So 25-4k >0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k <25/4. 25/4 is indeed 6.25. So the maximum integer k is 6, but that's not an option here. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the equation setup.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps I messed up the signs when plugging into the discriminant. Let me check. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant is (-5)^2 -4*1*k =25 -4k. Right, that's correct. So the condition is 25-4k>0 \u2192 k<6.25. So the largest integer is 6. But the options don't have 6. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me read again.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for two real and distinct roots, which requires discriminant greater than zero. So our approach is correct. But the options don't include 6. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the equation was written wrong. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. Yes. So maybe the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the largest integer such that the equation has real and distinct roots, but perhaps the quadratic is written differently. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. But no, the question says x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So the initial analysis is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the options have a typo. Let me think about the options given: the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. All of these are larger than 6.25 except maybe C)3. So if I thought that k must be greater than 6.25, but that's not the case. No, wait, the discriminant condition is 25 -4k>0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k <6.25. So any k less than 6.25 would work.\n\nLooking at the options, the only possible k that is less than 6.25 is C)3. So the largest among the options given that is less than 6.25 is 3. But wait, the question is asking for the largest integral value of k. So 3 is the maximum among the options. But wait, that can't be right because 3 is much smaller than 6.25.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me think again. Because 25-4k>0 \u2192 4k<25 \u2192k<6.25. So the maximum integer is 6. But since the options don't have 6, perhaps the question is miswritten, or I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Let me try that. Then, discriminant would be 25 -4k. Same condition. So same result.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, but the user has a different equation. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the discriminant formula.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the discriminant and find the maximum k such that it's positive. So 25 -4k >0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192k <6.25. So k can be up to 6.25, so maximum integer is 6. Since 6 isn't an option, perhaps the options are wrong. But given the options, perhaps I need to pick the highest possible value that is less than 6.25, which would be 3, but that seems too low.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation. Let me recheck the question: the quadratic equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. Correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant formula. The discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. So (-5)^2 is 25, 4ac is 4*1*k=4k. So discriminant is 25-4k. Right. So condition is 25-4k>0 \u2192 k<6.25.\n\nSo the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. But in the options, the only number less than 6.25 is C)3. The other options are 7,8,9,12, which are all larger than 6.25. So using these options, if the correct k is 6, but it's not listed, the next highest possible would be 3, but that's the only option under 6.25.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me look again: options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. So the only option less than 6.25 is C)3. So that would be the answer. But that seems odd because 3 is much smaller than 6.25. So perhaps the question is reversed. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, maybe I should think that the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, and the discriminant is 25 -4k. So for two distinct real roots, discriminant>0 \u2192 25-4k>0 \u2192k <6.25. So the maximum integer k is 6. But the options don't have 6, so perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But in reality, that's not the case. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the largest integer k such that the equation has real roots, but perhaps I'm considering the wrong condition. Let me think again: the equation has two real and distinct roots when the discriminant is positive. So 25 -4k>0 \u2192k<6.25. So any integer less than 6.25 is acceptable. But the options don't have 6. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but since I have to choose from the options, I'm forced to pick the next lower integer, which is 3.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 3 is much lower than 6. So perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is the other way around. Wait, what if the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, but the discriminant is calculated incorrectly. Let me think: if the equation was x\u00b2 +5x +k=0, then a=1, b=5, c=k. Discriminant would be 25 -4k. So same condition.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the equation setup. Let me re-examine the problem statement: the quadratic equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. Correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is asking for the largest integer such that the equation has real roots, but perhaps I'm supposed to find the maximum possible k where the roots are real and distinct, which would be just below 6.25. So the largest integer is 6, but that's not an option. So perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, or the options are incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about the equation x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, but it's supposed to have two real and equal roots, which would require discriminant equal to zero. So 25-4k=0 \u2192k=6.25. So the largest integer less than that is 6, but again, 6 isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is the reverse. Maybe the equation has two real roots when discriminant is positive, but if I'm looking for the maximum k, perhaps I should think of when the equation starts to have no real roots. Wait, no, because we want it to have real roots, so we need discriminant positive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the maximum k where the equation has real roots, which is k<6.25, so the largest integer is 6. But again, the options don't have 6.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the options and see which one is less than 6.25. The options are 9,7,3,8,12. So only 3 is less than 6.25. So the largest possible k among the options is 3. But that seems really low. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant calculation.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the discriminant for each option and see which one is positive.\n\nOption A: k=9. Discriminant: 25 -4*9=25-36= -11. Negative, so no real roots. So A is wrong.\n\nOption B: k=7. Discriminant:25-28= -3. Negative. So B is wrong.\n\nOption C: k=3. 25-12=13>0. So yes, two real roots. So C is possible.\n\nOption D: k=8. 25-32= -7. Negative.\n\nOption E: k=12. 25-48= -23. Negative.\n\nSo among the options, only C)3 yields a positive discriminant. So the largest integral k among the options is 3, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, that's strange because 3 is much lower than 6.25. So the problem might have a typo, or perhaps I'm missing something. But given the options, the correct answer must be C)3.\n",

So dividing both sides by -4 gives k < 25/4.\n\nWhat's 25 divided by 4? 25/4 is 6.25. So k must be less than 6.25. But the question asks for the largest integral value of k.

The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. Yes. So maybe the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the largest integer such that the equation has real and distinct roots, but perhaps the quadratic is written differently. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. But no, the question says x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So the initial analysis is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the options have a typo. Let me think about the options given: the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. All of these are larger than 6.25 except maybe C)3. So if I thought that k must be greater than 6.25, but that's not the case. No, wait, the discriminant condition is 25 -4k>0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k <6.25. So any k less than 6.25 would work.\n\nLooking at the options, the only possible k that is less than 6.25 is C)3. So the largest among the options given that is less than 6.25 is 3. But wait, the question is asking for the largest integral value of k. So 3 is the maximum among the options. But wait, that can't be right because 3 is much smaller than 6.25.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me think again. Because 25-4k>0 \u2192 4k<25 \u2192k<6.25. So the maximum integer is 6. But since the options don't have 6, perhaps the question is miswritten, or I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Let me try that. Then, discriminant would be 25 -4k. Same condition. So same result.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, but the user has a different equation. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the discriminant formula.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the discriminant and find the maximum k such that it's positive. So 25 -4k >0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192k <6.25. So k can be up to 6.25, so maximum integer is 6. Since 6 isn't an option, perhaps the options are wrong. But given the options, perhaps I need to pick the highest possible value that is less than 6.25, which would be 3, but that seems too low.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation. Let me recheck the question: the quadratic equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. Correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant formula. The discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. So (-5)^2 is 25, 4ac is 4*1*k=4k. So discriminant is 25-4k. Right. So condition is 25-4k>0 \u2192 k<6.25.\n\nSo the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. But in the options, the only number less than 6.25 is C)3. The other options are 7,8,9,12, which are all larger than 6.25. So using these options, if the correct k is 6, but it's not listed, the next highest possible would be 3, but that's the only option under 6.25.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me look again: options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. So the only option less than 6.25 is C)3. So that would be the answer. But that seems odd because 3 is much smaller than 6.25. So perhaps the question is reversed. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, maybe I should think that the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, and the discriminant is 25 -4k. So for two distinct real roots, discriminant>0 \u2192 25-4k>0 \u2192k <6.25. So the maximum integer k is 6. But the options don't have 6, so perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But in reality, that's not the case. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the largest integer k such that the equation has real roots, but perhaps I'm considering the wrong condition. Let me think again: the equation has two real and distinct roots when the discriminant is positive. So 25 -4k>0 \u2192k<6.25. So any integer less than 6.25 is acceptable. But the options don't have 6. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but since I have to choose from the options, I'm forced to pick the next lower integer, which is 3.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 3 is much lower than 6. So perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is the other way around. Wait, what if the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, but the discriminant is calculated incorrectly. Let me think: if the equation was x\u00b2 +5x +k=0, then a=1, b=5, c=k. Discriminant would be 25 -4k. So same condition.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the equation setup. Let me re-examine the problem statement: the quadratic equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. Correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is asking for the largest integer such that the equation has real roots, but perhaps I'm supposed to find the maximum possible k where the roots are real and distinct, which would be just below 6.25. So the largest integer is 6, but that's not an option. So perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, or the options are incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about the equation x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, but it's supposed to have two real and equal roots, which would require discriminant equal to zero. So 25-4k=0 \u2192k=6.25. So the largest integer less than that is 6, but again, 6 isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is the reverse. Maybe the equation has two real roots when discriminant is positive, but if I'm looking for the maximum k, perhaps I should think of when the equation starts to have no real roots. Wait, no, because we want it to have real roots, so we need discriminant positive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the maximum k where the equation has real roots, which is k<6.25, so the largest integer is 6. But again, the options don't have 6.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the options and see which one is less than 6.25. The options are 9,7,3,8,12. So only 3 is less than 6.25. So the largest possible k among the options is 3. But that seems really low. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant calculation.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the discriminant for each option and see which one is positive.\n\nOption A: k=9. Discriminant: 25 -4*9=25-36= -11. Negative, so no real roots. So A is wrong.\n\nOption B: k=7. Discriminant:25-28= -3. Negative. So B is wrong.\n\nOption C: k=3. 25-12=13>0. So yes, two real roots. So C is possible.\n\nOption D: k=8. 25-32= -7. Negative.\n\nOption E: k=12. 25-48= -23. Negative.\n\nSo among the options, only C)3 yields a positive discriminant. So the largest integral k among the options is 3, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, that's strange because 3 is much lower than 6.25. So the problem might have a typo, or perhaps I'm missing something. But given the options, the correct answer must be C)3.\n\n\nTo determine the largest integral value of \\( k \\) for which the quadratic equation \\( x^2 - 5x + k = 0 \\) has two real and distinct roots, we analyze the discriminant of the quadratic equation. For a general quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the discriminant is given by:\n\n\\[\nD = b^2 - 4ac\n\\]\n\nThe equation \\( x^2 - 5x + k = 0 \\) has \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -5 \\), and \\( c = k \\). Substituting these values into the discriminant formula:\n\n\\[\nD = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(k) = 25 - 4k\n\\]\n\nFor the equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be positive:\n\n\\[\n25 - 4k > 0\n\\]\n\nSolving this inequality:\n\n\\[\n25 - 4k > 0 \\implies 4k < 25 \\implies k < \\frac{25}{4} = 6.25\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( k \\) must be less than \\( 6.25 \\). The largest integer less than \\( 6.25 \\) is \\( 6 \\). However, since \\( 6 \\) is not among the provided options, we must evaluate the given options to find the largest value of \\( k \\) that satisfies \\( k < 6.25 \\).\n\nThe options are:\n- \\( A) 9 \\)\n- \\( B) 7 \\)\n- \\( C) 3 \\)\n- \\( D) 8 \\)\n- \\( E) 12 \\)\n\nChecking each option:\n- \\( A) k = 9 \\): \\( D = 25 - 4(9) = -11 \\) (negative, no real roots).\n- \\( B) k = 7 \\): \\( D = 25 - 4(7) = -3 \\) (negative, no real roots).\n- \\( C) k = 3 \\): \\( D = 25 - 4(3) = 13 \\) (positive, two real roots).\n- \\( D) k = 8 \\): \\( D = 25 - 4(8) = -7 \\) (negative, no real roots).\n- \\( E) k = 12 \\): \\( D = 25 - 4(12) = -23 \\) (negative, no real roots).\n\nAmong the options, only \\( k = 3 \\) satisfies the condition \\( k < 6.25 \\) and results in a positive discriminant. Therefore, the largest integral value of \\( k \\) among the options is \\( 3 \\).\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quadratic equation problem here, and I need to figure out the largest integer value of k for which the equation x\u00b2 -5x + k = 0 has two real and distinct roots. Hmm, let's think about what I remember from algebra.\n\nWait, right. For a quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, the discriminant determines the nature of the roots. The discriminant formula is D = b\u00b2 - 4ac. Oh yeah, and if D is positive, there are two distinct real roots. If D is zero, one real root (a repeated root), and if D is negative, the roots are complex or imaginary.\n\nSo in this equation, a is 1, b is -5, and c is k. Plugging into the discriminant: D = (-5)\u00b2 - 4 * 1 * k. That simplifies to 25 - 4k.\n\nWe need two real and distinct roots, so D must be greater than zero. So 25 -4k > 0. Let me solve that inequality. \n\n25 -4k > 0  \n=> Subtract 25 from both sides: -4k > -25  \nWait, when I divide both sides by a negative number, the inequality sign flips. So dividing both sides by -4 gives:  \nk < (-25)/(-4)  \nWhich is k < 6.25.\n\nSo k has to be less than 6.25. But the question asks for the largest integral value of k. So the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. But wait, looking at the options, I don't see 6 as an option. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check the options again. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Oh wait, none of these is 6. So that's confusing. Did I miscalculate the discriminant?\n\nWait, let's go back. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant D is b\u00b2 -4ac = (-5)^2 -4(1)(k) = 25 -4k. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo 25 -4k >0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k <25/4 \u2192 25 divided by 4 is 6.25. So k must be less than 6.25. So the largest integer is 6. But none of the options is 6. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me read it again. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. Wait, perhaps I have the equation wrong? No, that's what it says. So the options don't include 6. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the options have a typo? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant calculation. Let me double-check. Oh wait, wait. Let me recalculate D. b squared is (-5)^2=25. 4ac is 4*1*k=4k. So D=25-4k. Correct.\n\nSo for D>0, 25-4k>0 \u2192 4k<25 \u2192 k<6.25. So k can be up to 6, but not including 6.25.\n\nLooking at the options again, the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Wait, all these options are higher than 6.25 except for C)3. But 3 is much lower. So none of the options satisfy k<6.25 except for C)3. But the question is asking for the largest integral value. Wait, but all the other options are bigger than 6.25, which would make D negative, resulting in no real roots. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Is the equation x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, or is it x\u00b2 +5x +k? Wait, the question says x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So I think I got that right.\n\nWait, unless the problem is x\u00b2 -5x + k =0, but the options are for k's that are higher. But that would make the discriminant negative. So the equation would have no real roots, which isn't what the question is asking.\n\nWait, maybe the question is looking for two real and equal roots, but no, the question says distinct. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are incorrect. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about the quadratic formula. The roots are [5 \u00b1 sqrt(25-4k)] / 2. For the roots to be real and distinct, the sqrt part must be positive. So sqrt(25-4k) must be real and positive. So 25-4k must be greater than zero. Same conclusion as before.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct k is 6, but since it's not an option, maybe I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the largest integral value of k. So perhaps 6 is the answer, but it's not among the options. So maybe I'm doing something wrong. Let me check the options again.\n\nThe options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Wait, all of these are larger than 6.25 except for C)3. So that's the only one that would give D positive. Because for k=3, D=25 -12=13>0. So that would work. But the problem is, the question is asking for the largest possible k, so 3 is much smaller than the other options. So this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up the inequality. Let me go through it again.\n\nD = 25 -4k >0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192 25/4 >k \u2192 6.25> k. So k must be less than 6.25. So the maximum integer is 6. But 6 is not an option. So perhaps I have the equation backwards.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Let me check. Oh, no, the question says x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So that can't be it.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, but the problem is to find the maximum k such that the equation has two real and distinct roots. But all the options are higher than 6.25, which would make the discriminant negative. So that can't be.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the discriminant sign. Let me think again: the quadratic is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k.\n\nDiscriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac = (-5)^2 -4*1*k = 25 -4k. For real and distinct roots, D>0 \u2192 25-4k>0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k<6.25.\n\nSo the maximum integer is 6. But the options don't have 6. So perhaps the problem is reversed. Wait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Let's test that.\n\nIf the equation was x\u00b2 +5x +k=0, then a=1, b=5, c=k. D=25 -4k. So again, same condition: k<6.25. So same issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant formula. Wait, the discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. Wait, correct.\n\nSo perhaps the options are wrong, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the quadratic is written as x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, but perhaps the question is about the largest integral k such that the equation has two real roots, regardless of whether they are distinct. No, the question specifies two real and distinct roots.\n\nWait, unless I'm misunderstanding the question. The problem says \"two real and distinct roots.\" So that requires D>0. So the maximum k is 6. So I think the correct answer is 6, but it's not among the options. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is actually about the roots being integers or something else? But the question says real and distinct. So no, that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, but the question is asking for the maximum k where the roots are integers. But that's a different condition. But the question isn't about integer roots, it's about real and distinct.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the roots being integers. Let's see. Let's say the equation has integer roots. Then the discriminant must be a perfect square. So 25 -4k must be a perfect square. Let's see.\n\n25-4k = m\u00b2, where m is an integer. So 4k =25 -m\u00b2. So k=(25 -m\u00b2)/4. Since k must be an integer, 25 -m\u00b2 must be divisible by 4.\n\nLet's find possible m's. m\u00b2 can be 0,1,4,9,16,25, etc. So 25 - m\u00b2 must be positive and divisible by 4.\n\nLet's try m=3: m\u00b2=9 \u2192 25-9=16 \u2192 16/4=4. So k=4. m=1: 25-1=24 \u2192 24/4=6. m=5: 25-25=0 \u2192 k=0.\n\nWait, but in this case, the maximum k is 6. Again, 6 isn't an option.\n\nBut the problem isn't about integer roots. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are wrong. Let me re-examine the question again.\n\nThe options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. So perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me think of another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, but the problem is to find the maximum k such that the equation has two real roots. Wait, but that's what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the product of roots. The product is c/a =k. The sum of roots is -b/a=5.\n\nWait, but for real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be positive, which is the condition I used.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should try plugging in the options to see if any of them satisfy D>0.\n\nLet's try option D)8. Then k=8. D=25-4*8=25-32= -7 <0. So no real roots. So D is negative. So that's not acceptable.\n\nOption B)7: D=25-28= -3 <0. No.\n\nOption A)9: D=25-36= -11<0. No.\n\nOption E)12: D=25-48= -23<0. No.\n\nOption C)3: D=25-12=13>0. So that works. So the only option that gives D>0 is C)3. But the question is asking for the largest possible integer k. So the largest is 6, but it's not an option. So the next option is C)3. But wait, that can't be. Because 3 is much smaller than 6.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check each option.\n\nOption A: k=9 \u2192 D=25-36= -11 \u2192 no.\n\nOption B: k=7 \u2192 D=25-28= -3 \u2192 no.\n\nOption C: k=3 \u2192 D=25-12=13 \u2192 yes.\n\nOption D: k=8 \u2192 D=25-32= -7 \u2192 no.\n\nOption E: k=12 \u2192 D=25-48= -23 \u2192 no.\n\nSo the only option that works is C)3. But that's not the largest. So perhaps the problem is phrased incorrectly, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding it.\n\nWait, the question is asking for the largest integral value of k. So among the options, the largest that satisfies D>0 is C)3. But that's the smallest option. So perhaps the options are wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, another approach: the quadratic equation x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. Let's find k in terms of roots. Let the roots be r1 and r2. Then, r1 + r2=5, and r1*r2=k.\n\nFor real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be positive, which gives k<6.25 as before.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider the roots being real and positive. No, the question doesn't specify that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the quadratic equation having two real roots regardless of being distinct, but the wording says 'two real and distinct', so that's D>0.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. The correct answer according to the discriminant is 6, but it's not an option. So perhaps the problem was meant to have a different equation. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Let's try that. Then, a=1, b=5, c=k. D=25-4k. Same condition: 25-4k>0 \u2192k<6.25. So same issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is -x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. Then, a=-1, b=-5, c=k. Then D= (-5)^2 -4*(-1)(k) =25 +4k. So D=25+4k>0 \u2192 4k> -25 \u2192 k> -6.25. So any k greater than -6.25 would work. So the largest integer would be unbounded, but that's not the case here.\n\nSo that's probably not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Then, a=1, b=5, c=k. D=25-4k>0 \u2192 k<6.25. Again, same issue.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck here. The options don't include 6, which is the correct answer. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is phrased the other way. What if the question is asking for the smallest integral value of k? Then, the smallest would be k= -infinity, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the quadratic formula. Let me recheck:\n\nThe quadratic equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So the roots are [5 \u00b1 sqrt(25 -4k)] / 2.\n\nFor real and distinct roots, sqrt(25-4k) must be real and positive. So 25-4k>0 \u2192 k<6.25.\n\nSo the maximum integer is 6. So the answer should be 6, but it's not among the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is looking for the maximum k such that the equation has two real roots, but I'm being asked for the largest k, which is 6.25. But k must be integral, so 6.\n\nWait, but the options don't include 6. So perhaps I'm missing a key point.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about the quadratic equation having two equal roots, but the wording says distinct. No, that's not it.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, but the question is about the largest integer k where the equation has two real roots, regardless of being distinct. That would change things. In that case, D\u22650. So 25-4k\u22650 \u2192k\u22646.25. So maximum k is 6. But again, not an option.\n\nWait, but the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me think: the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So D=25-4k>0.\n\nWait, perhaps I should find the maximum k where the equation has two real roots, even if they are equal. So D\u22650. Then k\u22646.25. So maximum integer is 6. Still not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying the discriminant. Let me think again: the discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. So in this case, a=1, b=-5, c=k. So D=(-5)^2 -4(1)(k) =25-4k.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write it as D=25 -4k, and for real roots, D\u22650 \u2192 25-4k \u22650 \u21924k \u226425 \u2192k \u22646.25.\n\nSo the maximum integer k is 6. But no option matches. So perhaps the options are incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've misread the equation. Let me check again. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. No, that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Then D=25-4k. So same as before.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. The only possible conclusion is that the correct answer isn't among the options. But that's unlikely. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait, let me try each option with the equation to see which gives two real roots.\n\nOption A: k=9. Then D=25-36= -11. So no real roots.\n\nOption B: k=7. D=25-28= -3. No real roots.\n\nOption C: k=3. D=25-12=13>0. So two real roots.\n\nOption D: k=8. D=25-32= -7. No real roots.\n\nOption E: k=12. D=25-48= -23. No real roots.\n\nSo the only option that works is C)3. But the question asks for the largest integral value, and 3 is the smallest among the options that work. So perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is about the quadratic equation having two real roots, but they are integers. Let me try that.\n\nFor integer roots, the discriminant must be a perfect square. So 25-4k must be a perfect square. Let me find possible k.\n\nLet me set 25-4k = m\u00b2, where m is an integer. So 4k=25 - m\u00b2 \u2192 k=(25 -m\u00b2)/4.\n\nWe need k to be an integer, so (25 -m\u00b2) must be divisible by 4.\n\nLet's try m\u00b2 values less than 25.\n\nm=3: m\u00b2=9 \u2192 25-9=16 \u2192 16/4=4 \u2192k=4.\n\nm=1: 25-1=24 \u219224/4=6 \u2192k=6.\n\nm=5: 25-25=0 \u2192k=0.\n\nm=7: m\u00b2=49 \u2192 25-49= -24 \u2192 -24/4= -6 \u2192k=-6.\n\nBut k must be positive? The question doesn't specify, but in the options, all are positive.\n\nSo possible k values where roots are integers are 4,6,0,-6.\n\nSo the largest among these is 6. But again, 6 isn't an option.\n\nBut the options don't include 6. So perhaps the problem isn't about integer roots. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps I'm supposed to find the maximum k such that the equation has real roots, regardless of being distinct. But that would require D\u22650, which is same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is reversed, and I should maximize k such that the equation has two real roots, which would be 6. But again, not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the equation in terms of x. Let me think about the quadratic equation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should find the maximum k where the quadratic has two real roots, which is same as k<6.25. So the largest integer is 6. But no option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the equation having two real roots where both roots are integers. But as I saw earlier, k=6 gives D=25-24=1>0, so roots are (5\u00b11)/2 \u2192 3 and 2. Both integers. So for k=6, the roots are 2 and 3. So that's valid.\n\nBut again, 6 isn't an option.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. The only option that works is C)3. But that's the smallest possible k among the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the largest k such that the equation has two real roots, but without the distinct condition. Then, the discriminant could be zero or positive. So k \u22646.25. So the maximum integer is 6. But again, 6 isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is phrased as 'two real roots' without specifying distinct. But the question says 'two real and distinct'.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, and the problem is to find the maximum k where the equation has real roots. So D\u22650 \u2192k\u22646.25. So maximum integer is 6.\n\nBut the options don't have 6. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, or perhaps I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the discriminant. Let me recalculate.\n\nD = b\u00b2 -4ac.\n\nIn this equation, a=1, b=-5, c=k.\n\nSo D = (-5)^2 -4(1)(k) \u219225 -4k.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nHmm. I'm not sure what's going on. The only option that works is C)3. So perhaps that's the answer, but it's not the largest. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, and the question is to find the maximum k such that the equation has two real roots. So the maximum k is 6.25, so the largest integer is 6. But no option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased wrong, and the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k =0. Let's see. Then D=25-4k>0 \u2192k<6.25. Same issue.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, and the question is asking for the largest integer k where the equation has two real roots, which is 6, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but among the options, C)3 is the only one that works.\n\nWait, but the question says 'the largest integral value of k' from the options. So perhaps the correct answer is C)3.\n\nBut that seems odd because 3 is much smaller than 6.25. So perhaps I'm missing a key point.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the equation differently. Let me complete the square.\n\nx\u00b2 -5x +k=0.\n\nx\u00b2 -5x = -k.\n\n(x - 5/2)^2 = (25/4) -k.\n\nSo for real roots, the right side must be positive. So 25/4 -k>0 \u2192k<25/4 \u2192k<6.25.\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo I'm really stuck. I think the correct answer is 6, but it's not among the options. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, or perhaps I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is written as x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Let me check that.\n\nD=25-4k>0 \u2192k<6.25. Same issue.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should proceed with the only option that works, which is C)3.\n\nBut I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x -k=0. Then, D=25 +4k>0. So for any k, since 4k is positive, D is positive. So any k is acceptable. But the question is to find the largest integer k. But that's not bounded, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, and the problem is to find the maximum k for which the equation has two real roots. So the maximum k is 6.25, so the largest integer is 6. But no option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is looking for the maximum k where the quadratic has two integer roots. As earlier, k=6 gives roots 2 and 3. So that's valid. But 6 isn't an option.\n\nI'm really confused. The correct answer according to the discriminant is 6, but it's not an option. So perhaps the answer is C)3, but that doesn't make sense because 3 is much smaller than 6.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is written as x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, and the problem is to find the largest k such that the equation has two real roots. So the maximum k is 6.25, so the largest integer is 6. But again, not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the maximum k where the quadratic has two real roots, but the options are in reverse. So perhaps the correct answer isn't present.\n\nBut since the options are given, I have to choose from them. Only option C)3 works. So perhaps the answer is C)3.\n\nBut that seems wrong because 3 is much smaller than 6.25. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. Let's find the maximum k such that the quadratic has real roots. So D\u22650 \u2192k \u22646.25. So the maximum integer is 6.\n\nBut again, no option.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading the equation. Let me check the equation again. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. Yes.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. I think the correct answer is 6, but since it's not an option, I'll have to choose the next best thing. The only option that works is C)3.\n\nSo I'll go with option C)3.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quadratic equation problem here, and I need to figure out the largest integer value of k for which the equation x\u00b2 -5x + k = 0 has two real and distinct roots. Hmm, let's think about what I remember from algebra.\n\nWait, right. For a quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, the discriminant determines the nature of the roots. The discriminant formula is D = b\u00b2 - 4ac. Oh yeah, and if D is positive, there are two distinct real roots. If D is zero, one real root (a repeated root), and if D is negative, the roots are complex or imaginary.\n\nSo in this equation, a is 1, b is -5, and c is k. Plugging into the discriminant: D = (-5)\u00b2 - 4 * 1 * k. That simplifies to 25 - 4k.\n\nWe need two real and distinct roots, so D must be greater than zero. So 25 -4k > 0. Let me solve that inequality. \n\n25 -4k > 0  \n=> Subtract 25 from both sides: -4k > -25  \nWait, when I divide both sides by a negative number, the inequality sign flips. So dividing both sides by -4 gives:  \nk < (-25)/(-4)  \nWhich is k < 6.25.\n\nSo k has to be less than 6.25. But the question asks for the largest integral value of k. So the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. But wait, looking at the options, I don't see 6 as an option. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check the options again. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Oh wait, none of these is 6. So that's confusing. Did I miscalculate the discriminant?\n\nWait, let's go back. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant D is b\u00b2 -4ac = (-5)^2 -4(1)(k) = 25 -4k. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo 25 -4k >0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k <25/4 \u2192 25 divided by 4 is 6.25. So k must be less than 6.25. So the largest integer is 6. But none of the options is 6. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me read it again. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. Wait, perhaps I have the equation wrong? No, that's what it says. So the options don't include 6. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the options have a typo? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant calculation. Let me double-check. Oh wait, wait. Let me recalculate D. b squared is (-5)^2=25. 4ac is 4*1*k=4k. So D=25-4k. Correct.\n\nSo for D>0, 25-4k>0 \u2192 4k<25 \u2192 k<6.25. So k can be up to 6, but not including 6.25.\n\nLooking at the options again, the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Wait, all these options are higher than 6.25 except for C)3. But 3 is much lower. So none of the options satisfy k<6.25 except for C)3. But the question is asking for the largest integral value. Wait, but all the other options are bigger than 6.25, which would make D negative, resulting in no real roots. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Is the equation x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, or is it x\u00b2 +5x +k? Wait, the question says x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So I think I got that right.\n\nWait, unless the problem is x\u00b2 -5x + k =0, but the options are for k's that are higher. But that would make the discriminant negative. So the equation would have no real roots, which isn't what the question is asking.\n\nWait, maybe the question is looking for two real and equal roots, but no, the question says distinct. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are incorrect. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about the quadratic formula. The roots are [5 \u00b1 sqrt(25-4k)] / 2. For the roots to be real and distinct, the sqrt part must be positive. So sqrt(25-4k) must be real and positive. So 25-4k must be greater than zero. Same conclusion as before.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct k is 6, but since it's not an option, maybe I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the largest integral value of k. So perhaps 6 is the answer, but it's not among the options. So maybe I'm doing something wrong. Let me check the options again.\n\nThe options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Wait, all of these are larger than 6.25 except for C)3. So that's the only one that would give D positive. Because for k=3, D=25 -12=13>0. So that would work. But the problem is, the question is asking for the largest possible k, so 3 is much smaller than the other options. So this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up the inequality. Let me go through it again.\n\nD = 25 -4k >0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192 25/4 >k \u2192 6.25> k. So k must be less than 6.25. So the maximum integer is 6. But 6 is not an option. So perhaps I have the equation backwards.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Let me check. Oh, no, the question says x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So that can't be it.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, but the problem is to find the maximum k such that the equation has two real and distinct roots. But all the options are higher than 6.25, which would make the discriminant negative. So that can't be.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the discriminant sign. Let me think again: the quadratic is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k.\n\nDiscriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac = (-5)^2 -4*1*k = 25 -4k. For real and distinct roots, D>0 \u2192 25-4k>0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k<6.25.\n\nSo the maximum integer is 6. But the options don't have 6. So perhaps the problem is reversed. Wait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Let's test that.\n\nIf the equation was x\u00b2 +5x +k=0, then a=1, b=5, c=k. D=25 -4k. So again, same condition: k<6.25. So same issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant formula. Wait, the discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. Wait, correct.\n\nSo perhaps the options are wrong, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the quadratic is written as x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, but perhaps the question is about the largest integral k such that the equation has two real roots, regardless of whether they are distinct. No, the question specifies two real and distinct roots.\n\nWait, unless I'm misunderstanding the question. The problem says \"two real and distinct roots.\" So that requires D>0. So the maximum k is 6. So I think the correct answer is 6, but it's not among the options. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is actually about the roots being integers or something else? But the question says real and distinct. So no, that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, but the question is asking for the maximum k where the roots are integers. But that's a different condition. But the question isn't about integer roots, it's about real and distinct.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the roots being integers. Let's see. Let's say the equation has integer roots. Then the discriminant must be a perfect square. So 25 -4k must be a perfect square. Let's see.\n\n25-4k = m\u00b2, where m is an integer. So 4k =25 -m\u00b2. So k=(25 -m\u00b2)/4. Since k must be an integer, 25 -m\u00b2 must be divisible by 4.\n\nLet's find possible m's. m\u00b2 can be 0,1,4,9,16,25, etc. So 25 - m\u00b2 must be positive and divisible by 4.\n\nLet's try m=3: m\u00b2=9 \u2192 25-9=16 \u2192 16/4=4. So k=4. m=1: 25-1=24 \u2192 24/4=6. m=5: 25-25=0 \u2192 k=0.\n\nWait, but in this case, the maximum k is 6. Again, 6 isn't an option.\n\nBut the problem isn't about integer roots. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are wrong. Let me re-examine the question again.\n\nThe options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. So perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me think of another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, but the problem is to find the maximum k such that the equation has two real roots. Wait, but that's what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the product of roots. The product is c/a =k. The sum of roots is -b/a=5.\n\nWait, but for real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be positive, which is the condition I used.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should try plugging in the options to see if any of them satisfy D>0.\n\nLet's try option D)8. Then k=8. D=25-4*8=25-32= -7 <0. So no real roots. So D is negative. So that's not acceptable.\n\nOption B)7: D=25-28= -3 <0. No.\n\nOption A)9: D=25-36= -11<0. No.\n\nOption E)12: D=25-48= -23<0. No.\n\nOption C)3: D=25-12=13>0. So that works. So the only option that gives D>0 is C)3. But the question is asking for the largest possible integer k. So the largest is 6, but it's not an option. So the next option is C)3. But wait, that can't be. Because 3 is much smaller than 6.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check each option.\n\nOption A: k=9 \u2192 D=25-36= -11 \u2192 no.\n\nOption B: k=7 \u2192 D=25-28= -3 \u2192 no.\n\nOption C: k=3 \u2192 D=25-12=13 \u2192 yes.\n\nOption D: k=8 \u2192 D=25-32= -7 \u2192 no.\n\nOption E: k=12 \u2192 D=25-48= -23 \u2192 no.\n\nSo the only option that works is C)3. But that's not the largest. So perhaps the problem is phrased incorrectly, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding it.\n\nWait, the question is asking for the largest integral value of k. So among the options, the largest that satisfies D>0 is C)3. But that's the smallest option. So perhaps the options are wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, another approach: the quadratic equation x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. Let's find k in terms of roots. Let the roots be r1 and r2. Then, r1 + r2=5, and r1*r2=k.\n\nFor real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be positive, which gives k<6.25 as before.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider the roots being real and positive. No, the question doesn't specify that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the quadratic equation having two real roots regardless of being distinct, but the wording says 'two real and distinct', so that's D>0.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. The correct answer according to the discriminant is 6, but it's not an option. So perhaps the problem was meant to have a different equation. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Let's try that. Then, a=1, b=5, c=k. D=25-4k. Same condition: 25-4k>0 \u2192k<6.25. So same issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is -x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. Then, a=-1, b=-5, c=k. Then D= (-5)^2 -4*(-1)(k) =25 +4k. So D=25+4k>0 \u2192 4k> -25 \u2192 k> -6.25. So any k greater than -6.25 would work. So the largest integer would be unbounded, but that's not the case here.\n\nSo that's probably not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Then, a=1, b=5, c=k. D=25-4k>0 \u2192 k<6.25. Again, same issue.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck here. The options don't include 6, which is the correct answer. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is phrased the other way. What if the question is asking for the smallest integral value of k? Then, the smallest would be k= -infinity, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the quadratic formula. Let me recheck:\n\nThe quadratic equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So the roots are [5 \u00b1 sqrt(25 -4k)] / 2.\n\nFor real and distinct roots, sqrt(25-4k) must be real and positive. So 25-4k>0 \u2192 k<6.25.\n\nSo the maximum integer is 6. So the answer should be 6, but it's not among the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is looking for the maximum k such that the equation has two real roots, but I'm being asked for the largest k, which is 6.25. But k must be integral, so 6.\n\nWait, but the options don't include 6. So perhaps I'm missing a key point.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about the quadratic equation having two equal roots, but the wording says distinct. No, that's not it.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, but the question is about the largest integer k where the equation has two real roots, regardless of being distinct. That would change things. In that case, D\u22650. So 25-4k\u22650 \u2192k\u22646.25. So maximum k is 6. But again, not an option.\n\nWait, but the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me think: the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So D=25-4k>0.\n\nWait, perhaps I should find the maximum k where the equation has two real roots, even if they are equal. So D\u22650. Then k\u22646.25. So maximum integer is 6. Still not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying the discriminant. Let me think again: the discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. So in this case, a=1, b=-5, c=k. So D=(-5)^2 -4(1)(k) =25-4k.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write it as D=25 -4k, and for real roots, D\u22650 \u2192 25-4k \u22650 \u21924k \u226425 \u2192k \u22646.25.\n\nSo the maximum integer k is 6. But no option matches. So perhaps the options are incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've misread the equation. Let me check again. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. No, that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Then D=25-4k. So same as before.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. The only possible conclusion is that the correct answer isn't among the options. But that's unlikely. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait, let me try each option with the equation to see which gives two real roots.\n\nOption A: k=9. Then D=25-36= -11. So no real roots.\n\nOption B: k=7. D=25-28= -3. No real roots.\n\nOption C: k=3. D=25-12=13>0. So two real roots.\n\nOption D: k=8. D=25-32= -7. No real roots.\n\nOption E: k=12. D=25-48= -23. No real roots.\n\nSo the only option that works is C)3. But the question asks for the largest integral value, and 3 is the smallest among the options that work. So perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is about the quadratic equation having two real roots, but they are integers. Let me try that.\n\nFor integer roots, the discriminant must be a perfect square. So 25-4k must be a perfect square. Let me find possible k.\n\nLet me set 25-4k = m\u00b2, where m is an integer. So 4k=25 - m\u00b2 \u2192 k=(25 -m\u00b2)/4.\n\nWe need k to be an integer, so (25 -m\u00b2) must be divisible by 4.\n\nLet's try m\u00b2 values less than 25.\n\nm=3: m\u00b2=9 \u2192 25-9=16 \u2192 16/4=4 \u2192k=4.\n\nm=1: 25-1=24 \u219224/4=6 \u2192k=6.\n\nm=5: 25-25=0 \u2192k=0.\n\nm=7: m\u00b2=49 \u2192 25-49= -24 \u2192 -24/4= -6 \u2192k=-6.\n\nBut k must be positive? The question doesn't specify, but in the options, all are positive.\n\nSo possible k values where roots are integers are 4,6,0,-6.\n\nSo the largest among these is 6. But again, 6 isn't an option.\n\nBut the options don't include 6. So perhaps the problem isn't about integer roots. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps I'm supposed to find the maximum k such that the equation has real roots, regardless of being distinct. But that would require D\u22650, which is same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is reversed, and I should maximize k such that the equation has two real roots, which would be 6. But again, not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the equation in terms of x. Let me think about the quadratic equation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should find the maximum k where the quadratic has two real roots, which is same as k<6.25. So the largest integer is 6. But no option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the equation having two real roots where both roots are integers. But as I saw earlier, k=6 gives D=25-24=1>0, so roots are (5\u00b11)/2 \u2192 3 and 2. Both integers. So for k=6, the roots are 2 and 3. So that's valid.\n\nBut again, 6 isn't an option.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. The only option that works is C)3. But that's the smallest possible k among the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the largest k such that the equation has two real roots, but without the distinct condition. Then, the discriminant could be zero or positive. So k \u22646.25. So the maximum integer is 6. But again, 6 isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is phrased as 'two real roots' without specifying distinct. But the question says 'two real and distinct'.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, and the problem is to find the maximum k where the equation has real roots. So D\u22650 \u2192k\u22646.25. So maximum integer is 6.\n\nBut the options don't have 6. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, or perhaps I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the discriminant. Let me recalculate.\n\nD = b\u00b2 -4ac.\n\nIn this equation, a=1, b=-5, c=k.\n\nSo D = (-5)^2 -4(1)(k) \u219225 -4k.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nHmm. I'm not sure what's going on. The only option that works is C)3. So perhaps that's the answer, but it's not the largest. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, and the question is to find the maximum k such that the equation has two real roots. So the maximum k is 6.25, so the largest integer is 6. But no option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased wrong, and the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k =0. Let's see. Then D=25-4k>0 \u2192k<6.25. Same issue.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, and the question is asking for the largest integer k where the equation has two real roots, which is 6, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but among the options, C)3 is the only one that works.\n\nWait, but the question says 'the largest integral value of k' from the options. So perhaps the correct answer is C)3.\n\nBut that seems odd because 3 is much smaller than 6.25. So perhaps I'm missing a key point.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the equation differently. Let me complete the square.\n\nx\u00b2 -5x +k=0.\n\nx\u00b2 -5x = -k.\n\n(x - 5/2)^2 = (25/4) -k.\n\nSo for real roots, the right side must be positive. So 25/4 -k>0 \u2192k<25/4 \u2192k<6.25.\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo I'm really stuck. I think the correct answer is 6, but it's not among the options. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, or perhaps I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is written as x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Let me check that.\n\nD=25-4k>0 \u2192k<6.25. Same issue.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should proceed with the only option that works, which is C)3.\n\nBut I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x -k=0. Then, D=25 +4k>0. So for any k, since 4k is positive, D is positive. So any k is acceptable. But the question is to find the largest integer k. But that's not bounded, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, and the problem is to find the maximum k for which the equation has two real roots. So the maximum k is 6.25, so the largest integer is 6. But no option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is looking for the maximum k where the quadratic has two integer roots. As earlier, k=6 gives roots 2 and 3. So that's valid. But 6 isn't an option.\n\nI'm really confused. The correct answer according to the discriminant is 6, but it's not an option. So perhaps the answer is C)3, but that doesn't make sense because 3 is much smaller than 6.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is written as x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, and the problem is to find the largest k such that the equation has two real roots. So the maximum k is 6.25, so the largest integer is 6. But again, not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the maximum k where the quadratic has two real roots, but the options are in reverse. So perhaps the correct answer isn't present.\n\nBut since the options are given, I have to choose from them. Only option C)3 works. So perhaps the answer is C)3.\n\nBut that seems wrong because 3 is much smaller than 6.25. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. Let's find the maximum k such that the quadratic has real roots. So D\u22650 \u2192k \u22646.25. So the maximum integer is 6.\n\nBut again, no option.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading the equation. Let me check the equation again. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. Yes.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. I think the correct answer is 6, but since it's not an option, I'll have to choose the next best thing. The only option that works is C)3.\n\nSo I'll go with option C)3.\n\n\nTo determine the largest integral value of \\( k \\) for which the quadratic equation \\( x^2 - 5x + k = 0 \\) has two real and distinct roots, we analyze the discriminant of the quadratic equation. For a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the discriminant is given by:\n\n\\[\nD = b^2 - 4ac\n\\]\n\nFor the given equation \\( x^2 - 5x + k = 0 \\), the coefficients are \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -5 \\), and \\( c = k \\). Substituting these into the discriminant formula:\n\n\\[\nD = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(k) = 25 - 4k\n\\]\n\nFor the equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be positive (\\( D > 0 \\)):\n\n\\[\n25 - 4k > 0\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( k \\):\n\n\\[\n25 > 4k \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad k < \\frac{25}{4} = 6.25\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( k \\) must be less than \\( 6.25 \\). The largest integer less than \\( 6.25 \\) is \\( 6 \\). However, \\( 6 \\) is not among the provided options. To verify, we check the discriminant for each option:\n\n1. **Option A (\\( k = 9 \\)):**\n   \\[\n   D = 25 - 4(9) = 25 - 36 = -11 \\quad (\\text{negative, no real roots})\n   \\]\n\n2. **Option B (\\( k = 7 \\)):**\n   \\[\n   D = 25 - 4(7) = 25 - 28 = -3 \\quad (\\text{negative, no real roots})\n   \\]\n\n3. **Option C (\\( k = 3 \\)):**\n   \\[\n   D = 25 - 4(3) = 25 - 12 = 13 \\quad (\\text{positive, two real and distinct roots})\n   \\]\n\n4. **Option D (\\( k = 8 \\)):**\n   \\[\n   D = 25 - 4(8) = 25 - 32 = -7 \\quad (\\text{negative, no real roots})\n   \\]\n\n5. **Option E (\\( k = 12 \\)):**\n   \\[\n   D = 25 - 4(12) = 25 - 48 = -23 \\quad (\\text{negative, no real roots})\n   \\]\n\nAmong the options, only \\( k = 3 \\) satisfies the condition \\( D > 0 \\), meaning the quadratic equation has two real and distinct roots.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this quadratic equation problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty on my math, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is asking for the largest integer value of 'k' such that the equation x\u00b2 -5x +k =0 has two real and distinct roots. Hmm, right, I remember something about the discriminant from my algebra class. \n\nWait, the quadratic equation is ax\u00b2 + bx + c =0, right? And the discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. Oh yeah, and the discriminant tells us about the nature of the roots. If the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots. If it's zero, one real root, and if it's negative, complex roots. So for this problem, we need the discriminant to be positive because we want two real and distinct roots.\n\nSo let's apply that to the given equation. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. Comparing with the standard form, a is 1, b is -5, and c is k. So the discriminant D would be (-5)\u00b2 -4*(1)*(k). Calculating that, 25 minus 4k. \n\nWe need D > 0 for two distinct real roots. So 25 -4k >0. Let me solve this inequality. Subtract 25 from both sides? Wait, no, wait. Let me rearrange:\n\n25 -4k >0  \n=> -4k > -25  \nHmm, when I divide both sides by a negative number, the inequality sign flips. So dividing both sides by -4, I get k < 25/4. \n\n25 divided by 4 is 6.25. So k must be less than 6.25. But the question is asking for the largest integer value of k. So the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. But wait, looking at the options, I don't see 6 as an option. Let me check the options again.\n\nThe options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Hmm, none of these is 6. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait a second, maybe I messed up the discriminant. Let me double-check. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k, so a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant D = b\u00b2-4ac = (-5)^2 -4*(1)*(k) = 25 -4k. Yeah, that's correct. So 25-4k must be greater than zero. So 25>4k \u2192 k<25/4 \u2192 k<6.25.\n\nSo the largest integer k can be is 6. But none of the options are 6. Did I read the question correctly? It says \"the largest integral value of k\". Maybe I did a miscalculation somewhere. Let me check the options again. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Because 6 is not even in the options. Did I make a mistake in the discriminant? Or perhaps I misread the equation.\n\nWait, the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So yeah, a=1, b=-5, c=k. So the discriminant is 25 -4k. That seems right.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about having two real and distinct roots, so D>0. So k must be less than 6.25. So the maximum integer is 6. But the options don't have 6. Did I make a mistake in the inequality? Let me see:\n\n25 -4k >0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192 k <25/4 \u2192 k<6.25. So yes, 6.25 is the upper limit. So the largest integer is 6.\n\nBut since 6 isn't an option, perhaps I need to check if I read the question correctly. Oh wait, the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. None is 6. So did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the discriminant. Let me re-calculate.\n\nDiscriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac. So b is -5, so (-5)^2 is 25. 4ac is 4*1*k =4k. So D=25-4k. Correct.\n\nSo, 25-4k >0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192 k <25/4 \u2192 6.25. So the maximum integer k is 6. But the options don't have 6. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem understanding.\n\nWait, the quadratic equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. Maybe I confused the signs. Let me check: for ax\u00b2 +bx +c, the discriminant is b\u00b2-4ac. So yes, b is -5, so b squared is 25.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider the equation differently. Let me think: if the quadratic is x\u00b2 -5x +k, then it's correct. So the discriminant is 25 -4k.\n\nHmm. So the maximum k is 6.25, so the largest integer is 6. But the options don't have 6. So perhaps the problem is different? Or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the options. Let me list them again: A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Hmm, 7 is option B. Wait, if k is 7, then discriminant would be 25 -4*7 =25-28= -3, which is negative. That would give complex roots, not real and distinct. So k=7 is too big. So that can't be the answer.\n\nWait, but according to my calculation, the maximum k is 6. So perhaps the options are wrong, or I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I miscalculated the discriminant.\n\nWait, another approach: let's test each option to see which is the largest k where D>0.\n\nOption A: k=9. D=25 -4*9=25-36= -11. Negative, so no good.\n\nOption B: k=7. D=25-28=-3. Negative.\n\nOption C: k=3. D=25-12=13. Positive. So two real roots.\n\nOption D: k=8. D=25-32= -7. Negative.\n\nOption E: k=12. D=25-48= -23. Negative.\n\nSo among the options, only k=3 and maybe k=6 would work. But k=6 isn't an option. So the highest possible k in the options that gives D>0 is k=3, which is option C. But that can't be right because 3 is less than 6.25. So why are the options so high?\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me check each option again:\n\nOption D: k=8. So D=25 -4*8=25-32= -7. No.\n\nOption B: k=7. D=25-28=-3. No.\n\nSo the only option that gives D>0 is option C: k=3, which gives D=13>0. So the largest k in the options that works is 3. But wait, the question is asking for the largest integral value of k, but in the options, 3 is the only one that works. So the answer would be C)3.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 6 is larger than 3 and works, but 6 isn't an option. So maybe the options are incorrect, or I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, let's think again: equation x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. Discriminant D=25-4k. For D>0, 25>4k \u2192 k <6.25. So the maximum integer k is 6. But since 6 isn't an option, the next lower is 5, 4, etc. But the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nSo among these, only k=3 (C) and perhaps no others. Because 3 is less than 6.25, so D=25-12=13>0. So that's acceptable.\n\nWait, but what about k=5? Let's check: D=25-20=5>0. So that's acceptable. So k=5 is allowed, but 5 isn't an option either.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are wrong. Or maybe I read the question wrong. Let me read the question again.\n\nQuestion: What is the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x\u00b2 -5x +k =0 will have two real and distinct roots?\n\nSo, perhaps the options are incorrect. Because 6 is the correct answer, but it's not listed. So the problem must have a mistake, but I have to choose from the given options.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k, but no, the equation is as given.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the case where the quadratic has two real roots, but perhaps I'm being asked for the maximum k where it's a perfect square, but no, the question says two real and distinct roots.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, and maybe I should compute D =25 -4k>0 \u2192 k<6.25. So the maximum integer is 6. But 6 isn't an option, so the next lower is 3. So the answer must be C)3.\n\nWait, but that would be the case only if 3 is the highest possible option that works. But that doesn't make sense because 6 is higher than 3 and works. So why is the correct answer 3? That can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me think again. Wait, in the quadratic equation, if the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k, then a=1, b=-5, c=k. So the discriminant is (-5)^2 -4*1*k =25 -4k.\n\nWait, maybe I should write the discriminant as 4k <25 \u2192 k <6.25. So the maximum integer k is 6, but 6 isn't an option. So perhaps the question is asking for the maximum k in the options that is less than 6.25.\n\nLooking at the options, the possible k values are 3, 7, 8, 9, 12. Only 3 is less than 6.25. So the answer would be C)3.\n\nWait, but that seems strange because 3 is the only option that works. But why is 3 the correct answer when 6 is higher and works? Because 6 isn't an option, perhaps the problem is designed that way. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, maybe the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k =0, which would change the discriminant. Let me try that. So a=1, b=5, c=k. D=25-4k. Same as before. So no, that doesn't change anything.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, and I'm supposed to find k such that the equation has real roots, but maybe I'm supposed to find the maximum k where the roots are integers? Hmm, that's a different question. But the question didn't mention integer roots, just two real and distinct.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is correct, and the options are wrong. But since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about the roots. For the quadratic equation, the sum of roots is 5 (since -b/a =5), and the product is k. So the roots are r and s, where r + s =5 and r*s =k. For two real roots, the discriminant must be positive, so k <6.25. So the maximum integer is 6, but it's not an option. So the next possible is 3.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. The correct approach is to compute D>0, find k<6.25, and since the options don't have 6, the next possible is 3. So the answer is C)3.\n\nBut I'm confused because 3 is the only option that works, but it's the smallest option. So I think I must have made a mistake somewhere, but I can't spot it. Alternatively, perhaps the question is correct and the options are wrong.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I choose k=3, then the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +3=0. The discriminant is 25-12=13>0, so two real roots. For k=4, D=25-16=9>0. Also two real roots. For k=5, D=25-20=5>0. Also two real roots. For k=6, D=25-24=1>0. So two real roots. So the maximum k is 6, which is not an option.\n\nSo perhaps the options are wrong, but the correct answer isn't present. However, given the options, the only correct one is C)3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation was written incorrectly. Suppose the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Then a=1, b=5, c=k. D=25-4k>0 \u2192 4k<25 \u2192k<6.25. So same result. So no, that doesn't change anything.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. I think the correct answer is 6, but it's not an option. So perhaps the problem is misprinted, but I have to choose from the given options.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant formula. Let me check again. The discriminant is b\u00b2-4ac. So for x\u00b2 -5x +k, that's (-5)^2 -4*1*k =25-4k. Correct.\n\nSo, the answer must be 6, but since it's not present, perhaps the intended answer is 7, but that gives D=-3, which is invalid. So maybe the correct answer isn't in the options. But that's impossible because it's a multiple-choice question. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe the equation is x\u00b2 -5x -k=0. Then a=1, b=-5, c=-k. So D=25 -4*(1)*(-k) =25 +4k. So for D>0, 25 +4k>0 \u21924k> -25 \u2192k> -6.25. So in that case, k can be any integer greater than -6.25. But that's a different scenario.\n\nBut the original equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, so I think I'm correct in my earlier approach.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 6, but it's not an option. So perhaps the question intended a different equation, but I can't change it. So looking at the options, the only one that works is 3. So the answer is C)3.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this quadratic equation problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty on my math, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is asking for the largest integer value of 'k' such that the equation x\u00b2 -5x +k =0 has two real and distinct roots. Hmm, right, I remember something about the discriminant from my algebra class. \n\nWait, the quadratic equation is ax\u00b2 + bx + c =0, right? And the discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. Oh yeah, and the discriminant tells us about the nature of the roots. If the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots. If it's zero, one real root, and if it's negative, complex roots. So for this problem, we need the discriminant to be positive because we want two real and distinct roots.\n\nSo let's apply that to the given equation. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. Comparing with the standard form, a is 1, b is -5, and c is k. So the discriminant D would be (-5)\u00b2 -4*(1)*(k). Calculating that, 25 minus 4k. \n\nWe need D > 0 for two distinct real roots. So 25 -4k >0. Let me solve this inequality. Subtract 25 from both sides? Wait, no, wait. Let me rearrange:\n\n25 -4k >0  \n=> -4k > -25  \nHmm, when I divide both sides by a negative number, the inequality sign flips. So dividing both sides by -4, I get k < 25/4. \n\n25 divided by 4 is 6.25. So k must be less than 6.25. But the question is asking for the largest integer value of k. So the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. But wait, looking at the options, I don't see 6 as an option. Let me check the options again.\n\nThe options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Hmm, none of these is 6. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait a second, maybe I messed up the discriminant. Let me double-check. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k, so a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant D = b\u00b2-4ac = (-5)^2 -4*(1)*(k) = 25 -4k. Yeah, that's correct. So 25-4k must be greater than zero. So 25>4k \u2192 k<25/4 \u2192 k<6.25.\n\nSo the largest integer k can be is 6. But none of the options are 6. Did I read the question correctly? It says \"the largest integral value of k\". Maybe I did a miscalculation somewhere. Let me check the options again. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Because 6 is not even in the options. Did I make a mistake in the discriminant? Or perhaps I misread the equation.\n\nWait, the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So yeah, a=1, b=-5, c=k. So the discriminant is 25 -4k. That seems right.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about having two real and distinct roots, so D>0. So k must be less than 6.25. So the maximum integer is 6. But the options don't have 6. Did I make a mistake in the inequality? Let me see:\n\n25 -4k >0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192 k <25/4 \u2192 k<6.25. So yes, 6.25 is the upper limit. So the largest integer is 6.\n\nBut since 6 isn't an option, perhaps I need to check if I read the question correctly. Oh wait, the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. None is 6. So did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the discriminant. Let me re-calculate.\n\nDiscriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac. So b is -5, so (-5)^2 is 25. 4ac is 4*1*k =4k. So D=25-4k. Correct.\n\nSo, 25-4k >0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192 k <25/4 \u2192 6.25. So the maximum integer k is 6. But the options don't have 6. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem understanding.\n\nWait, the quadratic equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. Maybe I confused the signs. Let me check: for ax\u00b2 +bx +c, the discriminant is b\u00b2-4ac. So yes, b is -5, so b squared is 25.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider the equation differently. Let me think: if the quadratic is x\u00b2 -5x +k, then it's correct. So the discriminant is 25 -4k.\n\nHmm. So the maximum k is 6.25, so the largest integer is 6. But the options don't have 6. So perhaps the problem is different? Or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the options. Let me list them again: A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Hmm, 7 is option B. Wait, if k is 7, then discriminant would be 25 -4*7 =25-28= -3, which is negative. That would give complex roots, not real and distinct. So k=7 is too big. So that can't be the answer.\n\nWait, but according to my calculation, the maximum k is 6. So perhaps the options are wrong, or I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I miscalculated the discriminant.\n\nWait, another approach: let's test each option to see which is the largest k where D>0.\n\nOption A: k=9. D=25 -4*9=25-36= -11. Negative, so no good.\n\nOption B: k=7. D=25-28=-3. Negative.\n\nOption C: k=3. D=25-12=13. Positive. So two real roots.\n\nOption D: k=8. D=25-32= -7. Negative.\n\nOption E: k=12. D=25-48= -23. Negative.\n\nSo among the options, only k=3 and maybe k=6 would work. But k=6 isn't an option. So the highest possible k in the options that gives D>0 is k=3, which is option C. But that can't be right because 3 is less than 6.25. So why are the options so high?\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me check each option again:\n\nOption D: k=8. So D=25 -4*8=25-32= -7. No.\n\nOption B: k=7. D=25-28=-3. No.\n\nSo the only option that gives D>0 is option C: k=3, which gives D=13>0. So the largest k in the options that works is 3. But wait, the question is asking for the largest integral value of k, but in the options, 3 is the only one that works. So the answer would be C)3.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 6 is larger than 3 and works, but 6 isn't an option. So maybe the options are incorrect, or I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, let's think again: equation x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. Discriminant D=25-4k. For D>0, 25>4k \u2192 k <6.25. So the maximum integer k is 6. But since 6 isn't an option, the next lower is 5, 4, etc. But the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nSo among these, only k=3 (C) and perhaps no others. Because 3 is less than 6.25, so D=25-12=13>0. So that's acceptable.\n\nWait, but what about k=5? Let's check: D=25-20=5>0. So that's acceptable. So k=5 is allowed, but 5 isn't an option either.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are wrong. Or maybe I read the question wrong. Let me read the question again.\n\nQuestion: What is the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x\u00b2 -5x +k =0 will have two real and distinct roots?\n\nSo, perhaps the options are incorrect. Because 6 is the correct answer, but it's not listed. So the problem must have a mistake, but I have to choose from the given options.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k, but no, the equation is as given.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the case where the quadratic has two real roots, but perhaps I'm being asked for the maximum k where it's a perfect square, but no, the question says two real and distinct roots.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, and maybe I should compute D =25 -4k>0 \u2192 k<6.25. So the maximum integer is 6. But 6 isn't an option, so the next lower is 3. So the answer must be C)3.\n\nWait, but that would be the case only if 3 is the highest possible option that works. But that doesn't make sense because 6 is higher than 3 and works. So why is the correct answer 3? That can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me think again. Wait, in the quadratic equation, if the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k, then a=1, b=-5, c=k. So the discriminant is (-5)^2 -4*1*k =25 -4k.\n\nWait, maybe I should write the discriminant as 4k <25 \u2192 k <6.25. So the maximum integer k is 6, but 6 isn't an option. So perhaps the question is asking for the maximum k in the options that is less than 6.25.\n\nLooking at the options, the possible k values are 3, 7, 8, 9, 12. Only 3 is less than 6.25. So the answer would be C)3.\n\nWait, but that seems strange because 3 is the only option that works. But why is 3 the correct answer when 6 is higher and works? Because 6 isn't an option, perhaps the problem is designed that way. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, maybe the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k =0, which would change the discriminant. Let me try that. So a=1, b=5, c=k. D=25-4k. Same as before. So no, that doesn't change anything.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, and I'm supposed to find k such that the equation has real roots, but maybe I'm supposed to find the maximum k where the roots are integers? Hmm, that's a different question. But the question didn't mention integer roots, just two real and distinct.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is correct, and the options are wrong. But since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about the roots. For the quadratic equation, the sum of roots is 5 (since -b/a =5), and the product is k. So the roots are r and s, where r + s =5 and r*s =k. For two real roots, the discriminant must be positive, so k <6.25. So the maximum integer is 6, but it's not an option. So the next possible is 3.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. The correct approach is to compute D>0, find k<6.25, and since the options don't have 6, the next possible is 3. So the answer is C)3.\n\nBut I'm confused because 3 is the only option that works, but it's the smallest option. So I think I must have made a mistake somewhere, but I can't spot it. Alternatively, perhaps the question is correct and the options are wrong.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I choose k=3, then the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +3=0. The discriminant is 25-12=13>0, so two real roots. For k=4, D=25-16=9>0. Also two real roots. For k=5, D=25-20=5>0. Also two real roots. For k=6, D=25-24=1>0. So two real roots. So the maximum k is 6, which is not an option.\n\nSo perhaps the options are wrong, but the correct answer isn't present. However, given the options, the only correct one is C)3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation was written incorrectly. Suppose the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Then a=1, b=5, c=k. D=25-4k>0 \u2192 4k<25 \u2192k<6.25. So same result. So no, that doesn't change anything.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. I think the correct answer is 6, but it's not an option. So perhaps the problem is misprinted, but I have to choose from the given options.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant formula. Let me check again. The discriminant is b\u00b2-4ac. So for x\u00b2 -5x +k, that's (-5)^2 -4*1*k =25-4k. Correct.\n\nSo, the answer must be 6, but since it's not present, perhaps the intended answer is 7, but that gives D=-3, which is invalid. So maybe the correct answer isn't in the options. But that's impossible because it's a multiple-choice question. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe the equation is x\u00b2 -5x -k=0. Then a=1, b=-5, c=-k. So D=25 -4*(1)*(-k) =25 +4k. So for D>0, 25 +4k>0 \u21924k> -25 \u2192k> -6.25. So in that case, k can be any integer greater than -6.25. But that's a different scenario.\n\nBut the original equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, so I think I'm correct in my earlier approach.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 6, but it's not an option. So perhaps the question intended a different equation, but I can't change it. So looking at the options, the only one that works is 3. So the answer is C)3.\n\n\nTo determine the largest integral value of \\( k \\) for which the quadratic equation \\( x^2 - 5x + k = 0 \\) has two real and distinct roots, we use the discriminant condition. For a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the discriminant is given by:\n\n\\[\nD = b^2 - 4ac\n\\]\n\nFor the given equation \\( x^2 - 5x + k = 0 \\), the coefficients are \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -5 \\), and \\( c = k \\). Substituting these into the discriminant formula:\n\n\\[\nD = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(k) = 25 - 4k\n\\]\n\nFor the equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be positive:\n\n\\[\n25 - 4k > 0\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( k \\):\n\n\\[\n25 > 4k \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad k < \\frac{25}{4} = 6.25\n\\]\n\nThus, the largest integer value of \\( k \\) is \\( 6 \\). However, \\( 6 \\) is not among the provided options. To verify, we test the given options:\n\n- **Option A (\\( k = 9 \\))**: \\( D = 25 - 4(9) = -11 \\) (negative, so no real roots).\n- **Option B (\\( k = 7 \\))**: \\( D = 25 - 4(7) = -3 \\) (negative, so no real roots).\n- **Option C (\\( k = 3 \\))**: \\( D = 25 - 4(3) = 13 \\) (positive, so two real roots).\n- **Option D (\\( k = 8 \\))**: \\( D = 25 - 4(8) = -7 \\) (negative, so no real roots).\n- **Option E (\\( k = 12 \\))**: \\( D = 25 - 4(12) = -23 \\) (negative, so no real roots).\n\nAmong the options, only \\( k = 3 \\) satisfies the condition \\( D > 0 \\).
