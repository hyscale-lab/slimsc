      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. It says there's a rectangular piece of 150 square meters. The length is 1 meter more than four times the breadth. And the question is asking for the perimeter. Hmm, alright.\n\nWait, I remember that for rectangles, the area is calculated by multiplying length and breadth. So, area equals length times width. Oh right, and the perimeter is 2 times (length plus width). So I think I need to find the length and breadth first, using the area given.\n\nThe problem says the length is 1m more than four times the breadth. Let me denote the breadth as, let's say, 'b' meters. So, length would be 4 times b plus 1. So length = 4b + 1.\n\nSince the area is 150, I can set up the equation: area = length \u00d7 breadth. So, 150 = (4b + 1) \u00d7 b. Let me write that out: 150 = b*(4b +1). Expanding that, it's 150 = 4b\u00b2 + b.\n\nWait, that's a quadratic equation. So I can rearrange it to 4b\u00b2 + b - 150 = 0. Now, I need to solve for b. Quadratic equations can be solved using the quadratic formula. The standard form is ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, so here a is 4, b is 1, and c is -150.\n\nThe quadratic formula is (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)) / (2a). Plugging in the numbers: discriminant D is (1)^2 -4*(4)*(-150). Let me compute that. 1 + 4*4*150. 4*4 is 16, 16 *150 is 2400. So D is 1 +2400 = 2401. The square root of 2401 is 49, because 49*49 is 2401.\n\nSo the solutions are (-1 \u00b149)/(2*4). Let's compute both possibilities. First, (-1 +49)/8 = (48)/8 =6. The other solution is (-1-49)/8 = -50/8 = -6.25. But since breadth can't be negative, we take the positive solution, which is 6 meters. So the breadth is 6 meters.\n\nNow, the length is 4 times the breadth plus 1. So length =4*6 +1 =24 +1 =25 meters.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 4 times 6 is 24, plus 1 is 25. Yes. Now, area is 25 *6 = 150, which matches the given area. Good.\n\nNow, the perimeter is 2*(length + breadth). So, 2*(25 +6) = 2*(31) =62 meters.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 62 m. So that's the answer.\n",

The problem states that the length is 1 meter more than four times the breadth. So, if I let the breadth be some variable, say 'b', then the length would be four times that plus one. Let me write that out: length = 4*b + 1. Oh wait, that's the same as length = 4b + 1.\n\nSo I have two equations now:\n1. length \u00d7 breadth = 150\n2. length = 4b + 1\n\nI can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for 'b'. Let's do that. Replace 'length' in the first equation with (4b + 1), so:\n\n(4b + 1) * b = 150.\n\nExpanding that, I get 4b\u00b2 + b = 150. Hmm, that looks like a quadratic equation.

Quadratic equations can be solved using the quadratic formula, factoring if possible, or completing the square. Let me see if I can factor this.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to (4 * -150) = -600 and add up to 1. Hmm, factors of 600... Let's think: 24 and 25? 25 * (-24) is -600, and 25 + (-24) is 1. Oh, that works.\n\nSo, I can split the middle term using these numbers.

That's a negative number, which doesn't make sense for breadth, so we can ignore this solution.\n\nThe other factor: b -6 =0 \u2192 b=6 meters. That makes sense because breadth can't be negative.\n\nNow that I have the breadth, I can find the length. Using the second equation: length =4b +1.

So the answer should be C.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the perimeter of a rectangular piece of land with an area of 150 square meters, where the length is 1 meter more than four times the breadth. \n\nLet the breadth be \\( b \\) meters. Then, the length is \\( 4b + 1 \\) meters. The area of the rectangle is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{breadth} = (4b + 1) \\cdot b = 150\n\\]\n\nExpanding and rearranging:\n\n\\[\n4b^2 + b - 150 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation of the form \\( 4b^2 + b - 150 = 0 \\). Using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( A = 4 \\), \\( B = 1 \\), and \\( C = -150 \\). The discriminant is:\n\n\\[\nB^2 - 4AC = 1^2 - 4(4)(-150) = 1 + 2400 = 2401\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root of the discriminant:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2401} = 49\n\\]\n\nSubstituting back into the formula:\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{-1 \\pm 49}{8}\n\\]\n\nThis gives two solutions:\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{-1 + 49}{8} = \\frac{48}{8} = 6 \\quad \\text{(valid, since breadth cannot be negative)}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{-1 - 49}{8} = \\frac{-50}{8} = -6.25 \\quad \\text{(invalid, as breadth cannot be negative)}\n\\]\n\nThus, the breadth is \\( b = 6 \\) meters.

Oh right, the area is 150 square meters. The length is 1 meter more than four times the breadth. Wait, breadth is another word for width, right? So I think I can model this with some algebra.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. Let me denote the breadth as 'b'. Then, the length would be four times the breadth plus one. So, length 'l' equals 4b + 1. Got that.\n\nThe area of a rectangle is length multiplied by breadth. So the area is l * b = 150. Substituting l with 4b +1, that becomes (4b +1) * b = 150.

Because 25 * (-24) = -600, and 25 + (-24) = 1. Yes, that works. So I can split the middle term using these numbers.\n\nSo, 4b\u00b2 +25b -24b -150 = 0.

From the second group, factor out -6: -6(4b +25). Wait, wait, let me check that. Wait, the second group is -24b -150. So factor out -6: -6*(4b +25).

The problem says the length is 1 meter more than four times the breadth. I need to find the perimeter. \n\nWait, let me break this down. Let me assign variables to make it easier. Let's say the breadth is 'b' meters. Then the length would be four times that plus one. So length l = 4b + 1. \n\nThe area is l * b, which is 150. So substituting, (4b + 1) * b = 150. That gives me 4b\u00b2 + b = 150. Oh wait, I should rearrange that into a standard quadratic equation. So 4b\u00b2 + b - 150 = 0.\n\nNow I need to solve for b. Quadratic equation, right? The general form is ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0. So here, a is 4, b is 1, and c is -150. Wait, but that's confusing because the variable is also 'b'. Maybe I should use a different variable for the quadratic equation's coefficients.

Let me plug those numbers in.\n\nCalculating the discriminant first: B\u00b2 - 4AC = (1)^2 - 4 *4*(-150) = 1 + 2400 = 2401. Oh, 2401 is 49 squared, right? Because 49*49 is 2401. So the square root is 49.\n\nSo the solutions are [ -1 \u00b1 49 ]/(2*4). Let's compute both possibilities.\n\nFirst solution: (-1 +49)/8 = 48/8=6. Second solution: (-1 -49)/8 = -50/8 = -6.25. But since breadth can't be negative, we take the positive solution. So breadth b is 6 meters.\n\nThen the length l is 4b +1.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a rectangular piece of land. The area is given as 150 square meters. Hmm, right, area of a rectangle is length multiplied by breadth. The problem says the length is 1 meter more than four times the breadth. I need to find the perimeter. \n\nWait, let me break this down. Let me assign variables to make it easier. Let's say the breadth is 'b' meters. Then the length would be four times that plus one. So length l = 4b + 1. \n\nThe area is l * b, which is 150. So substituting, (4b + 1) * b = 150. That gives me 4b\u00b2 + b = 150. Oh wait, I should rearrange that into a standard quadratic equation. So 4b\u00b2 + b - 150 = 0.\n\nNow I need to solve for b. Quadratic equation, right? The general form is ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0. So here, a is 4, b is 1, and c is -150. Wait, but that's confusing because the variable is also 'b'. Maybe I should use a different variable for the quadratic equation's coefficients. Oh well, perhaps I should just proceed with the standard quadratic formula.\n\nThe quadratic formula is x = [-B \u00b1 sqrt(B\u00b2 -4AC)]/(2A), where A is 4, B is 1, and C is -150. Let me plug those numbers in.\n\nCalculating the discriminant first: B\u00b2 - 4AC = (1)^2 - 4 *4*(-150) = 1 + 2400 = 2401. Oh, 2401 is 49 squared, right? Because 49*49 is 2401. So the square root is 49.\n\nSo the solutions are [ -1 \u00b1 49 ]/(2*4). Let's compute both possibilities.\n\nFirst solution: (-1 +49)/8 = 48/8=6. Second solution: (-1 -49)/8 = -50/8 = -6.25. But since breadth can't be negative, we take the positive solution. So breadth b is 6 meters.\n\nThen the length l is 4b +1. Plugging in 6, that's 4*6=24 plus 1, so 25 meters.\n\nNow, perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + breadth). So that's 2*(25+6) = 2*31 =62 meters. Let me check the options. Option C is 62 m. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, did I make any mistakes? Let me double-check the calculations. Area: 25*6=150. Yes. Length is 4*6+1=25. So perimeter is 2*(25+6) = 62. Yep, looks right.\n\n\nLet the breadth of the rectangle be \\( b \\) meters. The length is given as \\( 4b + 1 \\) meters.
