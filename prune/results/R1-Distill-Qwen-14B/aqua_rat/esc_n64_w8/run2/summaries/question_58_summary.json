      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about chocolates in a store, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details right.\n\nThe question says that all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored only. So, no other options. 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored. That leaves the rest as vanilla, I guess. Then, 90% of the rest are squashed. Hmm, wait, what's the rest referring to here? Oh right, the rest after subtracting the cocoa ones.\n\nI think the goal is to find out what percentage of the chocolates are both vanilla and not squashed. So, vanilla and not squashed. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, let's assume there are 100 chocolates in total. It makes the math easier, and percentages are straightforward then. So, total = 100.\n\n10% are cocoa. So, cocoa = 10% of 100 = 10 chocolates. That leaves the remaining 90 as vanilla, right? Because 100 - 10 = 90. So vanilla = 90.\n\nNow, 90% of the rest are squashed. Wait, the rest here is the vanilla ones? Because the initial rest after subtracting cocoa. So the rest is 90. So 90% of these vanilla chocolates are squashed. Let me calculate that: 90% of 90 is 81. So, squashed vanilla = 81.\n\nWait, but what's the question again? It's asking for the percentage that's both vanilla and not squashed. Oh, right. So the vanilla chocolates not squashed would be the remaining part of the vanilla that isn't squashed.\n\nSince 90% are squashed, that means 10% are not squashed. So, 10% of 90 is 9. So, 9 chocolates are vanilla and not squashed.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I'm interpreting the question correctly. The problem says \"90% of the rest are squashed.\" The rest after cocoa is 90 (the vanilla ones). So 90% of 90 are squashed. So, 90 * 0.9 = 81 squashed, and the rest are not squashed. 90 - 81 = 9 not squashed.\n\nSo, out of the total 100 chocolates, 9 are vanilla and not squashed. That would be 9%. So the percentage is 9%. Looking at the options, D is 9%, so that's the answer.\n\nLet me check again. Total 100. 10 cocoa, 90 vanilla. 90% of vanilla are squashed: 81. So 9 are not squashed. 9/100 is 9%. Yep, that makes sense.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves determining the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed. Let's break it down:\n\n1. Assume there are 100 chocolates in total for simplicity.\n2. 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, so cocoa = 10 chocolates. This leaves 90 chocolates as vanilla.\n3. 90% of the vanilla chocolates are squashed. Thus, squashed vanilla = 90% of 90 = 81 chocolates.\n4. The remaining vanilla chocolates are not squashed. Therefore, vanilla and not squashed = 90 - 81 = 9 chocolates.\n5. The percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla and not squashed is (9 / 100) \u00d7 100% = 9%.\n\nThus, the answer is **D) 9%**.\n\nAnswer: D",

Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: In a chocolate store, all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored only. 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, 90% of the rest are squashed. What percentage of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed?\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. So first, all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa. That means there are only two flavors: vanilla and cocoa. No other options.\n\nThe first piece of information is that 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored. So, if I imagine the total number of chocolates as 100 (for simplicity), then 10% of them are cocoa. Let me calculate that. 10% of 100 is 10. So, 10 chocolates are cocoa-flavored. That leaves the rest as vanilla-flavored. Since 100 total, 100 minus 10 is 90. So, 90 are vanilla.\n\nWait, but the next part says 90% of the rest are squashed. Oh wait, I think I might have misread that. Let me check. Oh, no, the rest refers to the vanilla ones, I suppose. So after subtracting the 10% cocoa, the rest are vanilla. So 90 are vanilla.\n\nNow, 90% of the rest (which is the vanilla ones) are squashed. Wait, 90% of the vanilla are squashed. So, let me calculate that. 90% of 90 is... 0.9 times 90 is 81. So, 81 vanilla chocolates are squashed.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the percentage that are both vanilla and not squashed. So, the vanilla chocolates that are not squashed. Since 81 are squashed, the remaining vanilla ones are not squashed.\n\nSo, the total vanilla is 90. Subtract the 81 squashed ones, which gives 90 -81=9. So 9 are vanilla and not squashed.\n\nWait, wait. Wait a minute. Let me double-check. So, total is 100. 10 are cocoa. 90 are vanilla. Of the vanilla, 90% are squashed. So, 90% of 90 is 81 squashed vanilla. So, the vanilla that's not squashed is 90 minus 81 = 9. So 9 out of 100 are vanilla and not squashed. So that's 9%.\n\nWait, but the options are A)1%, B)2%, C)5%, D)9%, E)10%. So D is 9%.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

So 90 -81 =9 are vanilla and not squashed. So 9% of the total chocolates.\n\nSo the answer should be D)9%.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Is the 'rest' referring to the vanilla or the total after cocoa? Let me reread the question.\n\n\"10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, 90% of the rest are squashed.\" Oh, wait! So the 90% of the rest refers to the rest after cocoa. So, the rest is 90 (since 100-10=90). So 90% of those 90 are squashed.\n\nWait, that's what I did earlier. So that's correct.

Wait, so if I consider the total number of chocolates as, say, 100 for simplicity, 10% would be 10. That means the rest must be vanilla. Because all are either vanilla or cocoa. So 100 total, 10 cocoa, so 90 vanilla. Oh wait, wait. Let me make sure. So 10% cocoa implies 90% vanilla, right? Because 100% minus 10% is 90%. So vanilla is 90%.\n\nNow, the next part says 90% of the rest are squashed. Wait, the rest of what? Oh, I think the 'rest' refers to the vanilla ones. Because the first part says 10% are cocoa, so the rest are vanilla. So the 'rest' is 90% of the total. So 90% of that rest are squashed. Wait, so 90% of 90% are squashed.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's say the total is 100 chocolates. 10% are cocoa, so 10 are cocoa, and 90 are vanilla. Now, 90% of the vanilla are squashed. So 90% of 90 is 81. So 81 vanilla chocolates are squashed.\n\nBut the question asks for the percentage that are both vanilla and not squashed. Oh right, because some of the vanilla might be okay. So if 81 are squashed vanilla, then the remaining vanilla are not squashed. So 90 total vanilla minus 81 squashed equals 9 that are vanilla and not squashed.\n\nSo 9 out of 100 chocolates. That's 9%. So the answer should be D)9%.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Total chocolates = 100%.\n2. 10% are cocoa, so 90% are vanilla.\n3. Of those vanilla, 90% are squashed. So 90% of 90 is 81.\n4. So 81 are squashed vanilla, which leaves 90 -81=9 as vanilla and not squashed.\n5. 9 out of 100 is 9%.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the correct answer is D.\n\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Total Chocolates**: Assume there are 100 chocolates for simplicity.\n2. **Cocoa Flavored**: 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored. Therefore, there are \\( 10\\% \\times 100 = 10 \\) cocoa-flavored chocolates.\n3. **Vanilla Flavored**: Since all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa, the remaining \\( 100 - 10 = 90 \\) chocolates are vanilla-flavored.\n4. **Squashed Chocolates**: 90% of the vanilla-flavored chocolates are squashed. Thus, \\( 90\\% \\times 90 = 81 \\) vanilla-flavored chocolates are squashed.\n5. **Not Squashed Vanilla**: The number of vanilla-flavored chocolates that are not squashed is \\( 90 - 81 = 9 \\).\n6. **Percentage Calculation**: The percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla-flavored and not squashed is \\( \\frac{9}{100} \\times 100\\% = 9\\% \\).\n\nThus, the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla-flavored and not squashed is **9%**.\n\nAnswer: D",
