      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Arjun and Sajal and their money. Hmm, let's see. I think I should start by setting up some variables to represent how much each of them has. \n\nAlright, let's say Arjun has A dollars and Sajal has S dollars. That makes sense. Now, the problem gives me two scenarios, and I can write equations based on those.\n\nFirst scenario: If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, then Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. So, when Arjun gives $30 away, his new amount is A - 30. Sajal's new amount becomes S + 30. According to the problem, Sajal's money is twice what Arjun has left. So, I can write the equation as S + 30 = 2*(A - 30). Let me write that down: equation 1 is S + 30 = 2(A -30).\n\nSecond scenario: If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as what's left with Sajal. So, Sajal gives away $10, so his new amount is S -10. Arjun's new amount is A +10. The problem states that Arjun's money is thrice Sajal's remaining amount. So equation 2 is A +10 = 3*(S -10).\n\nNow I have two equations:\n\n1. S + 30 = 2(A -30)\n2. A +10 = 3(S -10)\n\nI need to solve these two equations to find A and S.\n\nLet me rewrite equation 1 to make it easier. Expanding the right side: 2A -60. So equation 1 becomes S +30 = 2A -60. Let's rearrange that to bring all terms to one side. Subtract S and add 60: 30 +60 = 2A - S \u2192 90 = 2A - S. So equation 1 simplifies to 2A - S =90.\n\nEquation 2 is A +10 =3S -30. Let's rearrange that as well. Subtract A and add 30: 10 +30 = 3S - A \u2192 40 = 3S - A. So equation 2 is 3S - A =40.\n\nNow I have two equations:\n1. 2A - S = 90\n2. 3S - A =40\n\nHmm, maybe I can solve this using substitution or elimination. Let's try elimination. Maybe express one variable in terms of the other from one equation and substitute.\n\nLooking at equation 1: 2A - S =90 \u2192 S = 2A -90.\n\nNow plug this into equation 2. Equation 2 is 3S - A =40. Substituting S:\n\n3*(2A -90) - A =40 \u2192 6A -270 -A =40 \u2192 5A -270 =40 \u2192 5A = 310 \u2192 A=62.\n\nWait, A is 62. Now plug back into S=2A -90: S= 2*62 -90 \u2192 124 -90=34. So S is 34.\n\nWait, so Arjun has $62, Sajal has $34. Let me check the options. Option B is 62,34. Option C is 34,62, which would be if the order was swapped. So the correct option is B?\n\nWait, but let me double-check the scenarios to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst scenario: Arjun gives $30 to Sajal. Arjun has 62-30=32, Sajal has 34+30=64. Is 64 twice 32? Yes, because 32*2=64. Correct.\n\nSecond scenario: Sajal gives $10 to Arjun. Sajal has 34-10=24, Arjun has 62+10=72. Is 72 thrice 24? Yes, 24*3=72. Correct.\n\nSo the answer is B) 62,34.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where Arjun and Sajal are friends with some money. I need to figure out how much each has based on the given conditions. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says: If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, then Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. Wait, Arun and Arjun\u2014wait, I think that's a typo. Oh, right, the names are Arjun and Sajal. So, the first condition is that when Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal's money becomes twice what Arjun has left.\n\nThe second condition is if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, then Arjun will have thrice as much as Sajal has left. Hmm, okay. So we have two different scenarios here, and both involve transferring money between them. \n\nLet me assign variables to their current amounts of money. Let's say Arjun has A dollars and Sajal has S dollars. That seems logical.\n\nNow, let's tackle the first condition. If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Arjun's new amount is A - 30, and Sajal's becomes S + 30. According to the problem, at this point, Sajal's money is twice Arjun's. So the equation would be:\n\nS + 30 = 2 * (A - 30)\n\nLet me write that down as equation (1):\nS + 30 = 2(A - 30)\n\nNow, the second condition: If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Sajal's new amount is S - 10, and Arjun's becomes A + 10. Here, Arjun will have thrice as much as Sajal. So the equation is:\n\nA + 10 = 3*(S - 10)\n\nThat's equation (2):\nA + 10 = 3(S - 10)\n\nNow, I have two equations with two variables. I can solve this system of equations to find A and S.\n\nLet me expand both equations.\n\nStarting with equation (1):\nS + 30 = 2A - 60\nBringing all terms to one side: S = 2A - 60 -30 \u2192 S = 2A -90. Let me note that as equation (1a).\n\nEquation (2):\nA +10 = 3S - 30\nBring all terms to one side: A = 3S -30 -10 \u2192 A = 3S -40. Let's call this equation (2a).\n\nNow, substitute equation (1a) into equation (2a). Since equation (1a) says S = 2A -90, I can plug that into equation (2a) wherever S is.\n\nSo, equation (2a) becomes:\nA = 3*(2A -90) -40\nLet me compute that.\n\nA = 6A -270 -40 \u2192 A =6A -310\n\nHmm, let's get all terms with A on the left. Subtract 6A from both sides:\n\nA -6A = -310 \u2192 -5A = -310 \u2192 5A = 310 \u2192 A = 310 /5 \u2192 A=62.\n\nSo Arjun has $62.\n\nNow, plug A=62 into equation (1a) to find S:\n\nS = 2*62 -90 \u2192 S=124-90=34.\n\nWait, that makes Sajal have $34. So Arjun has 62, Sajal has 34.\n\nWait, looking at the options, let's see. Option B is 62 and 34. Option C is 34, 62. So wait, which one is correct?\n\nWait, the options are labeled as A)62, 35; B)62, 34; C)34,62; etc.\n\nSo according to our calculation, Arjun is 62, Sajal is 34. So the pair is (62,34), which is option B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me verify the first condition: Arjun gives $30. Arjun has 62-30=32. Sajal has 34+30=64. Is 64 twice 32? Yes, because 2*32=64. So that condition holds.\n\nSecond condition: Sajal gives $10 to Arjun. Sajal has 34-10=24. Arjun has 62+10=72. Is 72 thrice 24? Yes, because 3*24=72. So both conditions are satisfied.\n\nWait, but wait, looking at the options, option B is (62,34) which matches our solution. But I'm confused because the names in the problem are Arjun and Sajal. Wait, wait, in the problem statement, the first condition says \"Arun gives $30\"\u2014wait, wait a typo? Because in the problem, the names are Arjun and Sajal, but in the first condition, it's Arun giving $30.\n\nWait, maybe the problem statement has a typo. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nQuestion: \"Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?\"\n\nWait, so the first condition refers to Arun giving money, but the friends are Arjun and Sajal. Maybe Arun is a typo for Arjun. Because it's the same person. So, in the first scenario, Arjun (not Arun) gives $30 to Sajal.\n\nSo our calculations are correct because we assumed that the first condition is Arjun giving money, which would align with the variables A and S.\n\nSo yes, the correct answer is Arjun has 62, Sajal has 34.

The problem gives me two scenarios, and I have to use those to find the correct amounts.\n\nLet me start by assigning variables to their money. Let's say Arjun has A dollars and Sajal has S dollars. That makes sense.\n\nThe first condition says, if Arun gives $30 to Sajal, then Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. Wait, wait. So when Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Arjun's new amount is A-30, and Sajal's becomes S+30. According to the problem, after this transaction, Sajal's money is twice what Arjun has. So the equation should be:\n\nS + 30 = 2 * (A - 30)\n\nLet me write that down: equation (1) is S + 30 = 2(A -30).\n\nThe second condition is, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, then Arjun will have thrice as much as what's left with Sajal. So in this case, Sajal's money becomes S-10, and Arjun's becomes A +10. The condition is that Arjun's amount is thrice Sajal's. So equation (2) is:\n\nA +10 = 3*(S -10)\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1) S +30 = 2(A -30)\n2) A +10 = 3(S -10)\n\nI need to solve these two equations to find A and S.\n\nLet me expand equation (1) first. S +30 = 2A -60. Let's rearrange it: S = 2A -60 -30 \u2192 S = 2A -90.\n\nThen equation (2): A +10 = 3S -30 \u2192 A = 3S -30 -10 \u2192 A = 3S -40.\n\nWait, so now I have S in terms of A from equation (1), and A in terms of S from equation (2). Maybe I can substitute one into the other.\n\nFrom equation (1): S = 2A -90. Let's substitute this into equation (2)'s expression for A.\n\nEquation (2): A = 3*(S) -40 \u2192 substitute S as 2A -90.\n\nSo A = 3*(2A -90) -40.\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\n3*(2A) is 6A, and 3*(-90) is -270. So:\n\nA = 6A -270 -40 \u2192 A =6A -310.\n\nNow, subtract 6A from both sides: A -6A = -310 \u2192 -5A = -310.\n\nDivide both sides by -5: A = (-310)/(-5) \u2192 A = 62.\n\nSo Arjun has $62. Now, let's find S using equation (1): S = 2A -90.\n\nSubstituting A=62: S = 2*62 -90 \u2192 124 -90 = 34.\n\nSo Sajal has $34.\n\nWait, let me check the options. The options are:\n\nA)62,35\n\nB)62,34\n\nC)34,62\n\nD)42,62\n\nE)62,42\n\nSo the pair is Arjun=62, Sajal=34. Looking at the options, option B is 62,34.

Does 64 equal twice 32? Yes, because 2*32=64. So that checks out.\n\nSecond scenario: Sajal gives $10 to Arjun.\n\nArjun:62+10=72, Sajal:34-10=24. Is 72 equal to thrice 24? 3*24=72. Yes, that also works.\n\nSo the calculations are correct. The answer should be option B.\n",

The first scenario is if Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, then Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. The second scenario is if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, then Arjun will have thrice as much as what's left with Sajal. I need to find out how much each of them has.\n\nLet me denote Arjun's money as A and Sajal's as S. So, variables A and S.\n\nFirst condition: Arjun gives $30 to Sajal. So Arjun's new amount is A - 30, and Sajal's becomes S + 30. According to the problem, after this transaction, Sajal has twice as much as Arjun. So:\n\nS + 30 = 2 * (A - 30)\n\nThat's equation one.\n\nSecond condition: Sajal gives $10 to Arjun. So Sajal's new amount is S -10, Arjun's becomes A +10. Now, Arjun has thrice as much as Sajal.

Hmm, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll assign variables to make it easier. Let's say Arjun has A dollars and Sajal has S dollars. Now, the problem gives two scenarios, and I'll translate each into equations.\n\nThe first scenario: If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, then Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. So, after giving away $30, Arjun's money becomes A - 30, right? And Sajal's money becomes S + 30. According to the condition, Sajal's new amount is twice Arjun's new amount. So the equation would be:\n\nS + 30 = 2*(A - 30)\n\nLet me write that down: S + 30 = 2(A -30)\n\nThe second scenario: If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, then Arjun will have thrice as much as Sajal is left with. So, Sajal's money after giving becomes S -10, and Arjun's becomes A +10. The condition here is that Arjun's new amount is three times Sajal's new amount. So the equation is:\n\nA + 10 = 3*(S - 10)\n\nSo that's the second equation: A +10 = 3(S -10)\n\nNow I have two equations:\n\n1) S +30 = 2(A -30)\n2) A +10 =3(S -10)\n\nI need to solve these two equations to find A and S.\n\nLet me start with the first equation. Expanding it:\n\nS +30 = 2A -60\n\nThen, bring like terms together. Subtract 2A from both sides and subtract 30:\n\nS = 2A -60 -30\nS = 2A -90\n\nSo equation 1 becomes S = 2A -90.\n\nNow equation 2: A +10 = 3(S -10)\n\nExpanding that:\n\nA +10 = 3S -30\n\nBring all terms to one side. Let's move 3S to the left and 10 to the right:\n\nA = 3S -30 -10\nA = 3S -40\n\nWait, that's equation 2 rewritten as A = 3S -40.\n\nNow I can substitute equation 1 into equation 2. Since S = 2A -90, I can plug that into equation 2.\n\nSubstituting S in equation 2:\n\nA = 3*(2A -90) -40\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nA = 6A -270 -40\nA =6A -310\n\nNow, subtract 6A from both sides:\n\nA -6A = -310\n-5A = -310\n\nDivide both sides by -5:\n\nA = (-310)/(-5) = 62\n\nSo Arjun has 62 dollars.\n\nNow, plug A=62 into equation 1 to find S:\n\nS = 2*62 -90 = 124 -90 =34\n\nSo Sajal has 34 dollars.\n\nWait, let me double-check these values with both original conditions to make sure.\n\nFirst condition: Arjun gives $30 to Sajal. Arjun's money becomes 62-30=32. Sajal's becomes 34+30=64. Is 64 twice 32? Yes, because 2*32=64. That checks out.\n\nSecond condition: Sajal gives $10 to Arjun. Sajal now has 34-10=24. Arjun has 62+10=72. Is 72 three times 24? Yes, because 3*24=72. That also checks out.\n\nSo the amounts are Arjun has 62 and Sajal has 34.

That works.\n\nYes, so the correct answer is option B: 62,34.\n\n\nLet \\( A \\) be the amount Arjun has, and \\( S \\) be the amount Sajal has.\n\n### Scenario 1: Arjun gives \\$30 to Sajal\n- Arjun's money becomes \\( A - 30 \\).\n- Sajal's money becomes \\( S + 30 \\).\n- According to the problem, \\( S + 30 = 2(A - 30) \\).\n  \\[\n  S + 30 = 2A - 60 \\implies S = 2A - 90 \\tag{1}.\n  \\]\n\n### Scenario 2: Sajal gives \\$10 to Arjun\n- Arjun's money becomes \\( A + 10 \\).\n- Sajal's money becomes \\( S - 10 \\).\n- According to the problem, \\( A + 10 = 3(S - 10) \\).\n  \\[\n  A + 10 = 3S - 30 \\implies A = 3S - 40 \\tag{2}.\n  \\]\n\n### Solving the Equations\nFrom equation (1): \\( S = 2A - 90 \\). Substituting this into equation (2):\n\\[\nA = 3(2A - 90) - 40 \\implies A = 6A - 270 - 40 \\implies A = 6A - 310.\n\\]\nRearranging:\n\\[\nA - 6A = -310 \\implies -5A = -310 \\implies A = \\frac{-310}{-5} = 62.\n\\]\nNow, substitute \\( A = 62 \\) into equation (1):\n\\[\nS = 2(62) - 90 = 124 - 90 = 34.\n\\]\n\n### Verification\n- **First scenario**: Arjun gives \\$30 to Sajal. Arjun has \\( 62 - 30 = 32 \\), and Sajal has \\( 34 + 30 = 64 \\). Since \\( 64 = 2 \\times 32 \\), this is correct.\n- **Second scenario**: Sajal gives \\$10 to Arjun. Arjun has \\( 62 + 10 = 72 \\), and Sajal has \\( 34 - 10 = 24 \\). Since \\( 72 = 3 \\times 24 \\), this is also correct.\n\nThus, Arjun has \\$62, and Sajal has \\$34. The correct answer is **B) 62, 34**.\n\nAnswer: B",
