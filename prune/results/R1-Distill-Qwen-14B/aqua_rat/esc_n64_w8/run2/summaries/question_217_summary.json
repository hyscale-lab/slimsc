      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe question says there are five horses in a race. Mr. Jain selects two of them at random and bets on them. The probability that he selected the winning horse is... and then there are five options given.\n\nHmm, wait a minute. I think I need to clarify the problem. Does it mean that there's a single winning horse, and Mr. Jain is betting on two? Or does he pick two and both need to win? No, wait, I think the question is about the probability that he has the winning horse among the two he picked. Because the way it's phrased is \"the probability that he selected the winning horse\"\u2014so probably the winning horse is one specific horse, and he picks two. So we need to find the probability that at least one of his two is the winner.\n\nWait, but maybe it's phrased differently. Let me think. Oh wait, no, perhaps the race has a single winner, and Mr. Jain is betting on two horses. So the probability that one of his two horses is the winner. Because that's the usual setup. So the question is, what is the probability that he correctly picked the winning horse when he selected two at random.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the probability that both horses he selected are the winning ones. But that doesn't make much sense because a race typically has one winner, not two. So I think the first interpretation is correct.\n\nSo, the setup is: there are five horses, one of which is the winner. Mr. Jain picks two horses at random. We need to find the probability that at least one of his two is the winner.\n\nWait, but sometimes in probability, it's easier to calculate the probability of the complement event and then subtract from 1. The complement here would be that neither of the two horses he picked is the winner. So, the probability that both are non-winners.\n\nLet me think about that. The total number of horses is 5, with one winner. So the number of non-winning horses is 4.\n\nWhen Mr. Jain selects two horses, the number of possible ways to choose two is combination of 5 taken 2 at a time. The formula for combinations is nCr = n!/(r! (n-r)!).\n\nSo 5C2 is 5!/(2! *3! ) = (5*4)/(2*1) )= 10. So there are 10 possible pairs.\n\nNow, the number of ways to pick two horses that are both non-winners. Since there are four non-winners, that's 4C2 = (4*3)/(2*1) )=6. So 6 favorable outcomes where neither is the winner.\n\nSo the probability that neither is the winner is 6/10, which simplifies to 3/5. Then the probability that at least one is the winner is 1 minus that, which is 1 - 3/5 = 2/5.\n\nWait, so that would make the probability 2/5. Looking at the options, option B is 2/5.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe the question is phrased differently. Suppose the question is the probability that he selected the winning horse, but he picks two. So perhaps the winning horse is one specific horse, and he picks two, and the probability that the winning horse is among his two.\n\nWait, that's a different approach. So, the probability that the winning horse is in his selection of two. So, how many ways are there to select two horses that include the winner?\n\nThere are 5 horses. The number of ways to choose two that include the winner is: well, the winner is one, and then you choose one more from the remaining four. So 4 ways. Because you pick the winner (1 way) and then one of the other four.\n\nSo the number of favorable outcomes is 4. The total possible is 10. So the probability is 4/10 = 2/5. Which again gives 2/5, option B.\n\nSo either way I think about it, whether calculating the complement or directly, I get the same answer.\n\nWait, but wait another thought: the problem says \"the probability that he selected the winning horse.\" If he selects two, but the winning horse is only one, then the probability that he has the winning horse is the same as the probability that the winning horse is among his two. So, as above, that's 4/10 = 2/5.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the chance that the first horse he picks is the winner is 1/5. The chance that the second horse is the winner, given that the first wasn't, is (1/4) * (1/5) ? No, wait, that's not correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, since he picks two, the probability that at least one is the winner is the same as 1 minus the probability that neither is the winner.\n\nWait, that's the same as the first approach. So 1 - (4/5 * 3/4) )= 1 - (3/5) )= 2/5.\n\nWait, 4/5 is the probability that the first horse he picks is not the winner. Then, if the first wasn't, the second has 3/4 chance of not being the winner. So the probability that neither is the winner is (4/5) * (3/4) )= 3/5. So again, 1 - 3/5 = 2/5.\n\nYes, that all adds up. So the answer is 2/5, which is option B.\n",

The options are A to E, with B being 2/5, which I'm thinking might be the answer, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think through this.\n\nHmm, wait. So, there are 5 horses, and Mr. Jain is picking two. The key here is to find the probability that at least one of the two horses he picks is the winner. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says he bets on them, and the probability that he selected the winning horse. Wait, does that mean he's trying to pick the winner, so if he picks the winner, he wins. So it's the probability that the winning horse is among the two he chose. Because if either of the two is the winner, he wins. Or wait, perhaps he's betting on both, but the race only has one winner. So maybe he's betting on both horses, but the race's winner is only one. So in that case, he wins if at least one of his two horses wins the race. Wait, but the problem says he \"selects two of the horses at random and bets on them.\" So I think the way to interpret this is: he picks two horses, and the race has one winner. So he wins if either of his two horses is the winner. So the probability is the chance that the winner is among his two selected horses.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is phrased differently. Wait, perhaps the question is phrased as \"the probability that he selected the winning horse.\" So maybe the winning horse is a single horse, and the question is whether he selected that specific horse. So, for example, if he picks two, what's the chance that the winning horse is one of them. So that would be the probability that the winning horse is in his pair.\n\nLet me clarify: the problem says \"the probability that he selected the winning horse.\" So, perhaps it's the probability that the winning horse is among the two he selected.\n\nSo, in probability terms, the winning horse is one specific horse out of five. Mr. Jain selects two. So how many possible ways are there for him to select two horses? The number of possible pairs is the combination of 5 taken 2 at a time. The formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n!/(k!(n-k)!). So 5 choose 2 is 5*4/(2*1) = 10 possible pairs.\n\nNow, how many of these pairs include the winning horse? Well, the winning horse is one specific horse. So the number of pairs that include it is the number of ways to choose one more horse from the remaining four. That's 4 choose 1, which is 4. So there are 4 favorable pairs.\n\nSo the probability is the number of favorable pairs divided by the total number of possible pairs. That's 4/10, which simplifies to 2/5. So the probability is 2/5.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 2/5. So the correct answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Another way to think about it is, what's the probability that the winning horse is selected in two picks. The probability that the first horse he picks is the winner is 1/5. The probability that the second horse he picks is the winner, given that the first wasn't, is (4/4) * (1/4) because after picking a non-winner, there are four horses left, one of which is the winner. Wait, no, perhaps a better way is to compute the probability that he picks the winner in either of the two selections.\n\nAlternatively, the probability that he selects the winning horse is the same as 1 minus the probability that he doesn't select the winning horse in either pick. So the probability that he doesn't pick the winner is (4/5) for the first pick, and then (3/4) for the second pick, because if he didn't pick the winner first, there are 4 horses left, 3 of which are non-winners. So the probability of not picking the winner in either is (4/5)*(3/4) = 3/5. So the probability of picking the winner at least once is 1 - 3/5 = 2/5. So that also gives 2/5, which confirms the earlier result.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So the answer is B, 2/5.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem to solve. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says: There are 5 horses in a race. Mr. Jain selects two horses at random and bets on them. The probability that he selected the winning horse is... and then there are five options.\n\nHmm, wait, I need to find the probability that at least one of the two horses he picks is the winning horse. Because if he bets on two, he wins if either one of them is the winner.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. The question says, \"the probability that he selected the winning horse.\" Oh, maybe I misunderstood. Does it mean that one of the two he selected is the winner? Or does it mean that both are the winning ones? No, that doesn't make much sense because in a race, there's only one winning horse, right? So he bets on two, and he wins if either of them is the winner.\n\nWait, but the way the question is phrased is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: \"The probability that he selected the winning horse.\" So he selects two, and the winning horse is among them. So he's asking for the probability that one of the two is the winner.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about him selecting the winning horse correctly, but since he's selecting two, perhaps he's placing a bet that both are winners? No, that doesn't make sense because in a race, only one horse wins. So I think the correct interpretation is that he selects two horses, and he wins if either of them is the winning horse.\n\nWait, but the way the question is phrased, it's about the probability that he selected the winning horse. So perhaps the winning horse is the one that wins, and he's picked two, so maybe the question is whether he picked the winning horse in his two selections. So the probability that the winning horse is among his two chosen horses.\n\nSo let me model this. There are 5 horses, let's say horse 1 is the winner. Mr. Jain picks any two. What's the chance that he picked horse 1 in his two choices.\n\nSo, the total number of possible ways he can choose two horses from five is combination 5 choose 2, which is (5*4)/(2*1) = 10 possible pairs.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes where he picked the winning horse (horse 1) is the number of pairs that include horse 1. So how many such pairs are there?\n\nWell, if he picks horse 1 and any of the other four, there are 4 such pairs: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). So 4 favorable pairs.\n\nSo the probability is favorable over total, which is 4/10. Simplifying that gives 2/5.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the probability of selecting the winning horse when choosing two.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem to solve. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says: There are 5 horses in a race. Mr. Jain selects two horses at random and bets on them. The probability that he selected the winning horse is... and then there are five options.\n\nHmm, wait, I need to find the probability that at least one of the two horses he picks is the winning horse. Because if he bets on two, he wins if either one of them is the winner.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. The question says, \"the probability that he selected the winning horse.\" Oh, maybe I misunderstood. Does it mean that one of the two he selected is the winner? Or does it mean that both are the winning ones? No, that doesn't make much sense because in a race, there's only one winning horse, right? So he bets on two, and he wins if either of them is the winner.\n\nWait, but the way the question is phrased is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: \"The probability that he selected the winning horse.\" So he selects two, and the winning horse is among them. So he's asking for the probability that one of the two is the winner.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about him selecting the winning horse correctly, but since he's selecting two, perhaps he's placing a bet that both are winners? No, that doesn't make sense because in a race, only one horse wins. So I think the correct interpretation is that he selects two horses, and he wins if either of them is the winning horse.\n\nWait, but the way the question is phrased, it's about the probability that he selected the winning horse. So perhaps the winning horse is the one that wins, and he's picked two, so maybe the question is whether he picked the winning horse in his two selections. So the probability that the winning horse is among his two chosen horses.\n\nSo let me model this. There are 5 horses, let's say horse 1 is the winner. Mr. Jain picks any two. What's the chance that he picked horse 1 in his two choices.\n\nSo, the total number of possible ways he can choose two horses from five is combination 5 choose 2, which is (5*4)/(2*1) = 10 possible pairs.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes where he picked the winning horse (horse 1) is the number of pairs that include horse 1. So how many such pairs are there?\n\nWell, if he picks horse 1 and any of the other four, there are 4 such pairs: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). So 4 favorable pairs.\n\nSo the probability is favorable over total, which is 4/10. Simplifying that gives 2/5.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the probability of selecting the winning horse when choosing two. So the probability that at least one of the two is the winner.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: The probability that he didn't pick the winner is the probability that both selected horses are not the winner. So the chance that the first horse is not the winner is 4/5. Then, the second horse is not the winner, given the first wasn't, is 3/4. So the probability of not picking the winner at all is (4/5)*(3/4) = 3/5.\n\nSo the probability of picking the winner in at least one of the two is 1 minus that, which is 1 - 3/5 = 2/5. Oh, that's the same result as before.\n\nSo the probability is 2/5, which is option B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.

Well, the winning horse is one specific horse. So, the number of pairs that include the winning horse is equal to the number of ways to choose the other horse. Since he's choosing 2, and one is the winner, the other can be any of the remaining 4. So that's 4 possible pairs.\n\nSo the number of favorable outcomes is 4.\n\nSo the probability is favorable divided by total: 4/10, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 2/5.

Alternatively, the probability that the first horse he picks is the winner plus the probability that the second horse is the winner, given that the first wasn't.\n\nSo, another way: the probability of picking the winner in two tries without replacement.\n\nSo, the first pick: 1/5 chance of picking the winner.\n\nIf the first pick wasn't the winner, which is 4/5 chance, then the second pick has 1/4 chance (since there are now 4 horses left, one of which is the winner).\n\nSo the total probability is (1/5) + (4/5)*(1/4) = (1/5) + (1/5) )= 2/5.\n\nSame result as before.

Mr. Jain is selecting two horses at random and betting on them. We need to find the probability that he selected the winning horse. Hmm.\n\nWait, wait. Wait a second. So, the race has five horses, and only one of them is the winning horse, I assume. Because usually, in a race, only one horse wins. So the winning horse is just one. So the question is, what's the probability that when Mr. Jain picks two horses randomly, he includes that one winning horse.\n\nHmm. So the probability that he picks the winning horse in his two selections. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nI think I should consider the total number of possible ways he can select two horses out of five. That would be the combination of 5 taken 2 at a time. The formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n!/(k! (n-k)!)). So 5 choose 2 is 5!/(2! * 3!) = (5*4)/(2*1) )=10. So there are 10 possible pairs of horses he could choose.\n\nNow, how many of these pairs include the winning horse? Well, the winning horse is just one, so if he must have that one, then the other horse in the pair can be any of the remaining four. Because there are four other horses besides the winner.\n\nSo the number of favorable outcomes is 4. Because for each of the other four horses, pairing with the winner is a favorable case. So the number of favorable pairs is 4.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, if I'm pairing the winner with each of the other four, that's four pairs. So the number of favorable outcomes is 4.\n\nSo the probability is the number of favorable divided by total possible. So 4 divided by 10, which simplifies to 2/5. So the probability is 2/5.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 2/5. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Another way to think about it: Alternatively, what's the probability that one of the two horses he picks is the winner.\n\nAnother approach: the probability that the first horse he picks is the winner is 1/5. If he doesn't pick the winner first, then the probability that the second horse is the winner is (4/5) * (1/4) because after picking a non-winner, there are four left, one of which is the winner. So adding those two probabilities: 1/5 + (4/5 * 1/4) = 1/5 + 1/5 = 2/5. Same result.\n\nSo yeah, that also gives 2/5. So that confirms it. So the correct answer is option B.\n",

Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe question says there are 5 horses in a race. Mr. Jain selects two horses at random and bets on them. We need to find the probability that he selected the winning horse. The options are A to E, with B being 2/5, which I think might be the answer, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nHmm, wait. Let me think. So, the race has 5 horses, and Mr. Jain picks two. The probability that one of those two is the winner. Wait, no. Wait, does the question say that the winning horse is one specific horse, and we're calculating the probability that Mr. Jain picked that one? Or is the winning horse determined, and we're checking if he got it right?\n\nWait, the way the question is phrased: \"The probability that he selected the winning horse.\" Oh, right, so I think it's that Mr. Jain picks two horses, and we want the probability that at least one of them is the winner. Or wait, no, wait. Does the problem imply that there's one winning horse, and Mr. Jain needs to have selected that specific horse?\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. The problem says he selects two horses at random and bets on them. So, I think that for him to win, at least one of the two horses he chose must be the winner. Because if either of them wins, he wins the bet.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"the probability that he selected the winning horse.\" So perhaps the wording is that he needs to have selected the horse that wins. Wait, but he selected two. So, maybe the probability that the winning horse is among his two choices. Because if the winning horse is one of them, he wins.\n\nAh, that makes sense. So the problem is about the chance that when he picks two horses, the winning one is in that pair.\n\nSo, the total number of horses is 5. He picks two. How many possible ways are there for him to pick two horses?\n\nWell, the total number of possible pairs is the combination of 5 horses taken 2 at a time. The formula for combinations is n choose k = n!/(k! (n-k)!)). So 5 choose 2 is 5!/(2! * 3!) = (5*4)/(2*1) = 10. So there are 10 possible pairs he could choose.\n\nNow, how many of those pairs include the winning horse? Well, the winning horse is one specific horse. So, if we fix the winning horse, how many pairs include it? Well, he needs to pick one more horse from the remaining four. So the number of favorable pairs is 4 choose 1, which is 4. Because once you have the winning horse, you pair it with any of the other four.\n\nSo, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. That would be 4/10, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, another way to think about it is: the probability that the winning horse is among the two he chose. So the first horse he picks has a 1/5 chance of being the winner. But since he's picking two, perhaps we can think of it as the probability that either the first or the second horse he picks is the winner.\n\nBut wait, that approach might be a bit more complicated because the selection is without replacement. Let me think. The chance that the first horse he picks is the winner is 1/5. If he didn't pick the winner first, then the chance the second one is the winner is 1/4, because there are four horses left. So the total probability would be (1/5) + (4/5)*(1/4) = 1/5 + 1/5 = 2/5. Oh, same result as before.\n\nSo that also gives 2/5, which is option B.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the probability that he does not pick the winning horse is the probability that both horses he picks are not the winner. So the first pick has a 4/5 chance of not being the winner. Then, the second pick has a 3/4 chance of not being the winner, since one non-winning horse has already been picked. So the probability of not picking the winner at all is (4/5)*(3/4) = 3/5. Therefore, the probability that he does pick the winner is 1 minus that, which is 1 - 3/5 = 2/5.\n\nHmm, again the same answer. So I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. The question says he selects two at random and bets on them. The probability that he selected the winning horse. So, perhaps I should think of it as the probability that at least one of his two selections is the winner. Which is what we've been calculating.\n\nBut another possible interpretation could be that he is trying to select the single winning horse, but he's selecting two and needs both to be correct. But that wouldn't make sense because the winning horse is just one. So, that would be a different calculation, but I don't think that's the case here.\n\nWait, no. Because in that scenario, if he needs both horses to be the winner, but there's only one winner, then that would be impossible, so the probability would be zero. But that's not the case here. So the correct interpretation is that he needs the winning horse to be among the two he selected. So the initial approach is correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be 2/5, which is option B.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is about Mr. Jain selecting two horses at random from five and betting on them. We need to find the probability that he selected the winning horse. Hmm, wait, wait. Wait, does that mean the winning horse is just one, and Mr. Jain has two picks? So, the probability that at least one of his two horses is the winner?\n\nWait, no. Let me think. The problem says \"the probability that he selected the winning horse.\" So maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh wait, perhaps the race has a single winning horse. So, Mr. Jain is selecting two horses, and we need to find the chance that he picked the winning horse. Or does it mean that he's picking two, and one of them is the winner? Hmm.\n\nWait, the question is a bit ambiguous. But I think it's more likely that the race has a single winning horse, and Mr. Jain is selecting two horses. The probability that he selected the winning horse (i.e., that the winning horse is among his two choices) is what we're looking for.\n\nAlternatively, another interpretation is that he selects two horses, and the probability that both are winning, but that seems less likely because races usually have one winner.\n\nSo, I think the first interpretation is correct. So, the setup is: 5 horses, one is the winner. Mr. Jain picks two horses at random. What's the probability that the winning horse is among his two choices.\n\nSo, how do I calculate that? Well, probability is the number of favorable outcomes over total possible outcomes.\n\nTotal possible outcomes are the number of ways to choose 2 horses out of 5. That's the combination of 5 choose 2. The formula for combinations is n choose k is n!/(k!(n-k)!)). So 5 choose 2 is (5*4)/(2*1) = 10. So there are 10 possible ways for Mr. Jain to choose two horses.\n\nFavorable outcomes are the number of ways he can choose the winning horse plus one more. Since there's only one winning horse, he must choose it and one of the remaining four. So the number of favorable ways is 4 (since after choosing the winner, he picks one of the other four horses). Wait, wait, no. Because when you choose two horses, and one is the winner, the number of favorable combinations is 4, because the winner is fixed, and the other can be any of the four others. So that would be 4 favorable outcomes.\n\nWait, but wait another second. If the winning horse is among the two he picks, that includes all combinations where he has the winner plus any other horse. So the number of favorable combinations is indeed 4 (since the other horse can be any of the four non-winners). So the probability is 4/10, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nWait, but wait a moment. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the probability that the winning horse is selected in the two picks. So the probability is (number of favorable outcomes) / (total outcomes). The favorable outcomes are all the pairs that include the winner. How many such pairs are there? For each pair that includes the winner, the other horse can be any of the remaining four. So that's 4 pairs. So 4 favorable outcomes, out of 10 total. So 4/10 = 2/5. So the answer would be B) 2/5.\n\nWait, but another approach is to think about the probability of selecting the winning horse when choosing two. The first horse he picks has a 1/5 chance of being the winner. But since he picks two, perhaps it's better to compute 1 minus the probability that neither of his choices is the winner.\n\nSo, the probability that the first horse he picks is not the winner is 4/5. Then, the probability that the second horse is not the winner given that the first wasn't is 3/4. So the combined probability that neither is the winner is (4/5)*(3/4) = 3/5. So the probability that at least one is the winner is 1 - 3/5 = 2/5. So again, that gives us 2/5.\n\nSo both approaches lead me to the same answer, which is 2/5. So looking at the options, that's option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is about Mr. Jain selecting two horses at random from five and betting on them. We need to find the probability that he selected the winning horse. Hmm, wait, wait. Wait, does that mean the winning horse is just one, and Mr. Jain has two picks? So, the probability that at least one of his two horses is the winner?\n\nWait, no. Let me think. The problem says \"the probability that he selected the winning horse.\" So maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh wait, perhaps the race has a single winning horse. So, Mr. Jain is selecting two horses, and we need to find the chance that he picked the winning horse. Or does it mean that he's picking two, and one of them is the winner? Hmm.\n\nWait, the question is a bit ambiguous. But I think it's more likely that the race has a single winning horse, and Mr. Jain is selecting two horses. The probability that he selected the winning horse (i.e., that the winning horse is among his two choices) is what we're looking for.\n\nAlternatively, another interpretation is that he selects two horses, and the probability that both are winning, but that seems less likely because races usually have one winner.\n\nSo, I think the first interpretation is correct. So, the setup is: 5 horses, one is the winner. Mr. Jain picks two horses at random. What's the probability that the winning horse is among his two choices.\n\nSo, how do I calculate that? Well, probability is the number of favorable outcomes over total possible outcomes.\n\nTotal possible outcomes are the number of ways to choose 2 horses out of 5. That's the combination of 5 choose 2. The formula for combinations is n choose k is n!/(k!(n-k)!)). So 5 choose 2 is (5*4)/(2*1) = 10. So there are 10 possible ways for Mr. Jain to choose two horses.\n\nFavorable outcomes are the number of ways he can choose the winning horse plus one more. Since there's only one winning horse, he must choose it and one of the remaining four. So the number of favorable ways is 4 (since after choosing the winner, he picks one of the other four horses). Wait, wait, no. Because when you choose two horses, and one is the winner, the number of favorable combinations is 4, because the winner is fixed, and the other can be any of the four others. So that would be 4 favorable outcomes.\n\nWait, but wait another second. If the winning horse is among the two he picks, that includes all combinations where he has the winner plus any other horse. So the number of favorable combinations is indeed 4 (since the other horse can be any of the four non-winners). So the probability is 4/10, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nWait, but wait a moment. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the probability that the winning horse is selected in the two picks. So the probability is (number of favorable outcomes) / (total outcomes). The favorable outcomes are all the pairs that include the winner. How many such pairs are there? For each pair that includes the winner, the other horse can be any of the remaining four. So that's 4 pairs. So 4 favorable outcomes, out of 10 total. So 4/10 = 2/5. So the answer would be B) 2/5.\n\nWait, but another approach is to think about the probability of selecting the winning horse when choosing two. The first horse he picks has a 1/5 chance of being the winner. But since he picks two, perhaps it's better to compute 1 minus the probability that neither of his choices is the winner.\n\nSo, the probability that the first horse he picks is not the winner is 4/5. Then, the probability that the second horse is not the winner given that the first wasn't is 3/4. So the combined probability that neither is the winner is (4/5)*(3/4) = 3/5. So the probability that at least one is the winner is 1 - 3/5 = 2/5. So again, that gives us 2/5.\n\nSo both approaches lead me to the same answer, which is 2/5.
