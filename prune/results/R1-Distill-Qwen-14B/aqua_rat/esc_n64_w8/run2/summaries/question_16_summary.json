Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe problem says: Let A and B be independent events with P(A) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.8. Find P(A/B). The options are A to E, with some numerical values.\n\nWait, P(A/B) is the probability of A given B, right? Because in probability, the notation P(A|B) is the probability that event A occurs given that B has occurred. Oh wait, but sometimes people write it as P(A/B), which I think is the same thing. So I'm looking for P(A|B).\n\nSince A and B are independent, I remember that the probability of A given B is just the probability of A. Because when two events are independent, the occurrence of one doesn't affect the other. So that should simplify things.\n\nLet me recall the formula for conditional probability. The formula is P(A|B) = P(A \u2229 B) / P(B). But if A and B are independent, then P(A \u2229 B) is equal to P(A) * P(B). Oh right, because independence implies that the joint probability is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nSo substituting into the formula, P(A|B) = [P(A) * P(B)] / P(B). The P(B) in the numerator and denominator cancels out, so it becomes P(A). That makes sense. So regardless of B, the probability of A doesn't change.\n\nGiven that, since P(A) is 0.2, then P(A|B) should also be 0.2. Looking at the options, option A is 0.2. So that must be the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to think about it: independence means that whether B happens or not doesn't affect A's probability. So if I'm told B occurred, A still has the same chance. So yes, 0.2 it is.\n",

I think I remember that when events are independent, their probabilities relate in certain ways. But wait, what's P(A/B)? Oh right, that's the probability of A given B has occurred. So P(A|B) is what we're looking for.\n\nWait, but if A and B are independent, does that mean that knowing B has happened doesn't change the probability of A? Because independent events don't influence each other. So if they're independent, then P(A|B) should just be equal to P(A), right?\n\nSo P(A) is given as 0.2. So the answer should be 0.2, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing things up. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A \u2229 B) / P(B). And since A and B are independent, P(A \u2229 B) is P(A) * P(B). So substituting that in, P(A|B) = (P(A)*P(B)) / P(B). Oh wait, the P(B) cancels out, so it's just P(A). So yeah, that's 0.2.\n\nI think that's right. So the correct answer should be A)0.2.\n\n\nTo find \\( P(A|B) \\), we use the formula for conditional probability:  \n\\[\nP(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}\n\\]  \nSince \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are independent events, \\( P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\cdot P(B) \\).

Then, P(B) is 0.8. So P(A|B) is 0.16 / 0.8.\n\nWait, doing the division: 0.16 divided by 0.8. Hmm, 0.8 goes into 0.16 how many times? 0.8 is 80%, so 0.16 is 16%. 16 divided by 80 is 0.2.
