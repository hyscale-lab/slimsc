      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a rope that's 20 meters long being cut into two pieces. One piece is 3 meters shorter than the other. I need to find the length of the longer piece. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nAlright, let's start by visualizing the situation. There's a rope, 20 meters in total. It's being cut into two parts. Let's call the lengths of these two parts something. Maybe I can assign variables to them to make it easier.\n\nWait, right, using variables is the way to go. Let me think: Let's say the longer piece has a length of x meters. Then, the shorter piece must be 3 meters less than that. So the shorter piece would be x minus 3 meters. Does that make sense? Yeah, because if one is 3 meters shorter, subtracting 3 gives the shorter length.\n\nNow, since the total length of the rope is 20 meters, the sum of the two pieces should equal 20. So, I can write an equation where the longer piece plus the shorter piece equals 20. Substituting my variables, that's x + (x - 3) = 20.\n\nLet me write that down: x + (x - 3) = 20. Now, I need to solve for x. Combining like terms, x plus x is 2x. Then, minus 3 equals 20. So, 2x - 3 = 20.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me make sure I'm combining correctly. x + (x-3) is 2x -3, right. So 2x -3 = 20. Now, to solve for x, I'll add 3 to both sides. 2x = 20 + 3. That's 23. So, 2x = 23.\n\nThen, divide both sides by 2. x = 23/2. 23 divided by 2 is 11.5. So, x is 11.5 meters. That's the longer piece. \n\nWait, but looking at the options, I see D is 11.5. So that's the answer. But let me double-check my math to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me go through the steps again. Let x be the longer piece. The shorter is x -3. Total is x + (x-3) = 20. That's 2x -3 = 20. Adding 3: 2x=23. Dividing by 2: x=11.5. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the longer piece is 11.5 meters long. Looking back at the options, option D is 11.5. So I think that's the right choice.\n",

So the total length is 20 meters. Let me denote the lengths of the two pieces. Suppose the longer piece is L meters, then the shorter one would be L minus 3 meters because it's 3 meters shorter.
