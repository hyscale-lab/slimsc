      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about population growth, and I need to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step. \n\nThe problem says that the population increases by 5% annually. The current population is 78,000, and we need to find the population after two years. The options are A to E, with E being none of these.\n\nHmm, I remember that percentage increases can be calculated by multiplying by 1 plus the percentage as a decimal. So for each year, it's 5% growth, which is 0.05 in decimal. So each year's population is the previous year's multiplied by 1.05.\n\nWait, but wait, does that apply for each year or compounded over two years? Oh right, because it's annual, so each year's growth is based on the previous year's population. So it's compound growth, not simple interest.\n\nLet me break it down. The first year's population would be 78,000 multiplied by 1.05. Let me calculate that. 78,000 * 1.05. Hmm, 78,000 times 1 is 78,000, and 78,000 times 0.05 is 3,900. So adding them together gives 78,000 + 3,900 = 81,900. So after the first year, the population is 81,900.\n\nNow, the second year. I take that 81,900 and multiply by 1.05 again. Let's compute that. 81,900 * 1.05. Hmm, 81,900 * 1 is 81,900, and 81,900 * 0.05 is 4,095. Adding those gives 81,900 + 4,095 = 85,995.\n\nWait, that's after two years. So the population would be 85,995. Let me check the options. Option B is 85,995. So that should be the answer. \n\nWait, but let me think again to make sure I didn't make a calculation mistake. Alternative approach: using the formula for compound interest, which is P = P0*(1 + r)^t. Here, P0 is 78,000, r is 0.05, t is 2.\n\nSo P = 78,000*(1.05)^2. Let me compute 1.05 squared. 1.05 * 1.05 is 1.1025. So 78,000 * 1.1025. Let's calculate that.\n\n78,000 * 1.1025. Hmm, 78,000 * 1 is 78,000. 78,000 * 0.1 is 7,800. 78,000 * 0.0025 is 195. So adding all together: 78,000 + 7,800 is 85,800, plus 195 is 85,995. Yeah, same result.\n\nSo the population after two years is 85,995. Looking at the options again, option B is 85,995. So the correct answer should be option B. \n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check my calculations. Sometimes when I do math quickly, I might make a mistake. Let me calculate 78,000 * 1.05 for the first year again.\n\n78,000 * 1.05: 78,000 * 1 is 78,000. 78,000 * 0.05 is 3,900. So 78,000 + 3,900 is 81,900. Correct. Then 81,900 * 1.05. 81,900 * 0.05 is 4,095. So 81,900 + 4,095 is 85,995. Yep.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another method. For two years, the total growth factor is 1.05 * 1.05 = 1.1025. Multiply that by 78,000. 78,000 * 1.1025. Let me break it down:\n\n78,000 * 1 = 78,000\n\n78,000 * 0.1 = 7,800\n\n78,000 * 0.0025 = 195\n\nAdding all together: 78,000 +7,800 is 85,800 + 195 is 85,995. Yep, same result.\n\nSo the correct answer is option B, 85,995.\n",

The question says that the population increases by 5% annually, and the current population is 78,000. They want to know what the population will be in two years. The options are A through E, with E being none of these.\n\nHmm, right, so population increase can be calculated using the formula for compound growth. I remember the formula is something like final amount equals initial amount multiplied by (1 plus the rate) raised to the number of periods. So, in formula terms, it's A = P*(1 + r)^n.\n\nLet me break it down. The initial population P is 78,000. The rate r is 5% annually, which is 0.05 as a decimal. The time n is 2 years.\n\nSo for the first year, the population increases by 5%. Let me calculate that. 78,000 multiplied by 0.05 is... 78,000 * 0.05 = 3,900. So after the first year, the population would be 78,000 + 3,900 = 81,900.\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to calculate it for two years. So I can't just add another 5% of the original number. Because each year's increase is based on the current population. So it's compounding.\n\nSo using the formula: A = 78,000*(1 + 0.05)^2. Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, 1 + 0.05 is 1.05. Squared, that's 1.05 * 1.05. Let me calculate that. 1.05 times 1.05 is 1.1025. Because 1 times 1 is 1, 1 times 0.05 is 0.05, 0.05 times 1 is 0.05, and 0.05 times 0.05 is 0.0025. Adding those up: 1 + 0.05 +0.05 +0.0025 = 1.1025.\n\nSo now, 78,000 multiplied by 1.1025. Let me do that step by step. 78,000 * 1 is 78,000. 78,000 * 0.1 is 7,800. 78,000 * 0.0025 is... let's see. 78,000 * 0.002 is 156, and 78,000 * 0.0005 is 39. So 156 +39 =195. So adding all parts together: 78,000 +7,800 is 85,800. Plus 195 is 85,995.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, no, I think I might have made a mistake in breaking it down. Let me try another approach. 78,000 * 1.1025.\n\nAlternatively, 78,000 * 1.1 is 85,800, because 10% of 78,000 is 7,800, so 78,000 + 7,800 is 85,800. Then, 78,000 * 0.0025 is 195. So 85,800 +195 is 85,995. So the total after two years would be 85,995.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 85,995, and option C is 85,800. So the correct answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, I can calculate each year's population step by step.\n\nYear 1: 78,000 * 1.05 = 81,900. So that's correct.\n\nYear 2: 81,900 * 1.05. Let's calculate that. 81,900 * 0.05 is 4,095. Adding that to 81,900 gives 85,995. Yep, same result. So that's correct.\n\nSo the options are:\n\nA)81900 \u2192 that's the population after one year.\n\nB)85995 \u2192 correct after two years.\n\nC)85800 \u2192 that's the 10% increase, but perhaps someone might think it's 5% each year for two years, adding 5% twice, which would be 78,000 *1.10=85,800.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about population growth. Hmm, let's see. The question says that a city's population increases by 5% annually. Right now, the population is 78,000. They're asking what the population will be in two years. The options are A) 81,900; B) 85,995; C) 85,800; D) 90,000; and E) None of these.\n\nWait, I remember that percentage increase can be calculated using the formula: new amount = original amount multiplied by (1 + rate). Oh right, and since it's for two years, I think I need to apply the 5% increase twice. Or maybe use a single calculation with the rate compounded for two years. Yeah, because each year's increase is based on the previous year's population.\n\nSo the formula for compound increase would be: P = P0 * (1 + r)^t. Where P0 is the initial population, r is the rate, and t is the time in years. So in this case, P0 is 78,000, r is 5% which is 0.05, and t is 2.\n\nLet me plug those numbers in. First, calculate (1 + 0.05) which is 1.05. Then, raise that to the power of 2. 1.05 squared is... let's see, 1.05 times 1.05. 1 times 1 is 1, 1 times 0.05 is 0.05, 0.05 times 1 is another 0.05, and 0.05 times 0.05 is 0.0025. Adding all those up: 1 + 0.05 + 0.05 + 0.0025 = 1.1025.\n\nSo the multiplier is 1.1025. Now multiply that by the initial population. 78,000 times 1.1025. Let me break that down. 78,000 * 1 is 78,000. 78,000 * 0.10 is 7,800. 78,000 * 0.0025 is... wait, 0.0025 is a quarter of a percent. So 78,000 * 0.0025 is 195.\n\nAdding them together: 78,000 + 7,800 is 85,800. Then plus 195 gives 85,995. Oh wait, wait, no, I think I messed that up. Because 1.1025 is 1 + 0.10 + 0.0025. So 78,000 * 1.1025 is 78,000 * (1 + 0.10 + 0.0025) = 78,000 + (7,800) + (195) = 78,000 + 7,800 is 85,800, plus 195 is 85,995. So the total would be 85,995.\n\nLooking at the options, B is 85,995. So that should be the correct answer. Wait, but let me double-check the calculation another way to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the population after each year. First year: 78,000 plus 5% of that. 5% of 78,000 is 3,900. So after the first year, the population is 78,000 + 3,900 = 81,900. That's option A, but that's only after one year. The question is about two years.\n\nSecond year's increase: 5% of 81,900. Let's calculate that. 5% is 0.05, so 81,900 * 0.05 = 4,095. Adding that to 81,900 gives 85,995. So again, same result. So yes, the population after two years is 85,995, which is option B.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again, option C is 85,800. Did I make a mistake somewhere? Because 85,800 is less than 85,995. Let me check the calculations again.\n\nWait, when I did the first method, I thought 78,000 * 1.1025 is 78,000 * (1.10 + 0.0025). Let me compute it as 78,000 * 1.1025. Let me do 78,000 * 1.10 first. 78,000 * 1.1 is 85,800. Then 78,000 * 0.0025 is 195. So 85,800 + 195 = 85,995. So that's correct.\n\nAnother way: 78,000 * 1.05 = 81,900 (first year). Then 81,900 * 1.05 = 85,995 (second year). So that's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be B) 85,995. But wait, why is option C 85,800? Oh, because 85,800 is 78,000 * 1.1, which is 10% increase, but that's only after one year. Or perhaps someone might have made a mistake by adding 5% twice, but that's not how percentage increases work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might have done 5% of 78,000 for two years, which would be 78,000 + (78,000 * 0.05 * 2) = 78,000 + 7,800 = 85,800. But that's incorrect because each year's 5% is on the increased population, not the original. So option C is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B, 85,995.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about population growth. Hmm, let's see. The question says that a city's population increases by 5% annually. Right now, the population is 78,000. They're asking what the population will be in two years. The options are A) 81,900; B) 85,995; C) 85,800; D) 90,000; and E) None of these.\n\nWait, I remember that percentage increase can be calculated using the formula: new amount = original amount multiplied by (1 + rate). Oh right, and since it's for two years, I think I need to apply the 5% increase twice. Or maybe use a single calculation with the rate compounded for two years. Yeah, because each year's increase is based on the previous year's population.\n\nSo the formula for compound increase would be: P = P0 * (1 + r)^t. Where P0 is the initial population, r is the rate, and t is the time in years. So in this case, P0 is 78,000, r is 5% which is 0.05, and t is 2.\n\nLet me plug those numbers in. First, calculate (1 + 0.05) which is 1.05. Then, raise that to the power of 2. 1.05 squared is... let's see, 1.05 times 1.05. 1 times 1 is 1, 1 times 0.05 is 0.05, 0.05 times 1 is another 0.05, and 0.05 times 0.05 is 0.0025. Adding all those up: 1 + 0.05 + 0.05 + 0.0025 = 1.1025.\n\nSo the multiplier is 1.1025. Now multiply that by the initial population. 78,000 times 1.1025.

So, I guess I'll need to calculate the population after the first year and then use that to find the population after the second year.\n\nWait, how does percentage increase work again? Oh right, if something increases by a certain percentage each year, you multiply the current amount by (1 + the percentage as a decimal).

The options are A to E, with E being none of these. Hmm.\n\nWait, so 5% annual increase. That means each year, the population is multiplied by 1 plus the rate, right? So the rate is 5%, which is 0.05 in decimal. So each year, the population becomes 1.05 times the previous year.\n\nLet me write this down. Current population, P0 = 78,000.\n\nAfter first year, P1 = P0 * 1.05.\n\nThen, after the second year, P2 = P1 * 1.05.\n\nSo, alternatively, P2 is P0 multiplied by 1.05 squared. Because each year it's multiplied by 1.05, and that's done twice.\n\nSo mathematically, P = P0 * (1 + r)^t, where r is the rate and t is time in years.\n\nPlugging in the numbers, P = 78,000 * (1.05)^2.\n\nLet me calculate that. 1.05 squared is 1.1025. Oh wait, because 1.05 * 1.05 is 1.1025.\n\nSo 78,000 multiplied by 1.1025. Let me compute that.\n\nHmm, 78,000 times 1.1 is 85,800. But wait, 1.1025 is a bit more than 1.1, so the result should be a bit more than 85,800.\n\nLet me compute 78,000 * 1.1025 more accurately.\n\nBreaking it down: 78,000 * 1 = 78,000.\n\n78,000 * 0.1025 = ?\n\n0.1025 is 10.25%. So 10% of 78,000 is 7,800. 0.25% is 0.25/100 *78,000. 0.25% is 195. So 10.25% is 7,800 + 195 = 7,995.\n\nSo 78,000 * 1.1025 = 78,000 + 7,995 = 85,995.\n\nWait, so that's 85,995.

But wait, let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are A)81,900, B)85,995, C)85,800, D)90,000, E) None.\n\nSo option B is 85,995, which matches our calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate it another way to confirm.\n\nAnother approach: calculate year by year.\n\nFirst year: 78,000 + 5% of 78,000.\n\n5% of 78,000 is 0.05 *78,000 = 3,900.\n\nSo after first year: 78,000 + 3,900 = 81,900.\n\nWait, that's option A, but that's only after one year. The question is about two years. So the next year's increase is on the new population, 81,900.\n\nSecond year's 5% is 0.05 *81,900 = 4,095.\n\nSo population after two years is 81,900 + 4,095 = 85,995. Same as before. So yes, option B is correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let's compute 81,900 *1.05.\n\n81,900 *1.05: 81,900 *1 is 81,900. 81,900 *0.05 is 4,095.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about population growth, and I need to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step.\n\nAlright, the question says the population increases by 5% annually. The current population is 78,000, and they want to know what it'll be in two years. The options are A to E, with E being none of these. Hmm.\n\nWait, so 5% annual increase. That means each year, the population is multiplied by 1 plus the rate, right? So the rate is 5%, which is 0.05 in decimal. So each year, the population becomes 1.05 times the previous year.\n\nLet me write this down. Current population, P0 = 78,000.\n\nAfter first year, P1 = P0 * 1.05.\n\nThen, after the second year, P2 = P1 * 1.05.\n\nSo, alternatively, P2 is P0 multiplied by 1.05 squared. Because each year it's multiplied by 1.05, and that's done twice.\n\nSo mathematically, P = P0 * (1 + r)^t, where r is the rate and t is time in years.\n\nPlugging in the numbers, P = 78,000 * (1.05)^2.\n\nLet me calculate that. 1.05 squared is 1.1025. Oh wait, because 1.05 * 1.05 is 1.1025.\n\nSo 78,000 multiplied by 1.1025. Let me compute that.\n\nHmm, 78,000 times 1.1 is 85,800. But wait, 1.1025 is a bit more than 1.1, so the result should be a bit more than 85,800.\n\nLet me compute 78,000 * 1.1025 more accurately.\n\nBreaking it down: 78,000 * 1 = 78,000.\n\n78,000 * 0.1025 = ?\n\n0.1025 is 10.25%. So 10% of 78,000 is 7,800. 0.25% is 0.25/100 *78,000. 0.25% is 195. So 10.25% is 7,800 + 195 = 7,995.\n\nSo 78,000 * 1.1025 = 78,000 + 7,995 = 85,995.\n\nWait, so that's 85,995. Looking at the options, option B is 85,995. So that's the answer. But wait, let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are A)81,900, B)85,995, C)85,800, D)90,000, E) None.\n\nSo option B is 85,995, which matches our calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate it another way to confirm.\n\nAnother approach: calculate year by year.\n\nFirst year: 78,000 + 5% of 78,000.\n\n5% of 78,000 is 0.05 *78,000 = 3,900.\n\nSo after first year: 78,000 + 3,900 = 81,900.\n\nWait, that's option A, but that's only after one year. The question is about two years. So the next year's increase is on the new population, 81,900.\n\nSecond year's 5% is 0.05 *81,900 = 4,095.\n\nSo population after two years is 81,900 + 4,095 = 85,995. Same as before. So yes, option B is correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let's compute 81,900 *1.05.\n\n81,900 *1.05: 81,900 *1 is 81,900. 81,900 *0.05 is 4,095. So adding gives 85,995. Yep.\n\nSo the correct answer is B, 85,995.\n\n\nTo determine the population of the city in 2 years with an annual growth rate of 5%, we start with the current population of 78,000. The formula for compound growth is:\n\n\\[\nP = P_0 \\times (1 + r)^t\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( P_0 = 78,000 \\) (initial population),\n- \\( r = 0.05 \\) (annual growth rate),\n- \\( t = 2 \\) (number of years).\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\nP = 78,000 \\times (1.05)^2\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( (1.05)^2 = 1.1025 \\).

The question says the population increases by 5% annually, and I need to find out what the population will be in two years from now. The current population is 78,000. The options are A to E, with E being none of these. \n\nAlright, so first, I remember that when something grows by a percentage each year, it's usually compound growth. So each year's increase is calculated on the new population, not the original. So I can't just add 5% twice on the original number; I need to apply it each year step by step.\n\nLet me write down the current population. It's 78,000. So in the first year, it increases by 5%. To find 5% of 78,000, I can calculate that. 5% is the same as 0.05 in decimal. So 78,000 multiplied by 0.05 equals... let me do the math. 78,000 * 0.05. Well, 78,000 divided by 20 (since 5% is 5 per 100, so 100/5 is 20). 78,000 divided by 20 is 3,900. So the increase in the first year is 3,900.\n\nAdding that to the original, the population after the first year would be 78,000 + 3,900 = 81,900. That's the population after one year. Now, the next year, it's another 5% increase on this new population.\n\nSo for the second year, I take 81,900 and calculate 5% of that. Again, 81,900 * 0.05. Let me compute that. Hmm, 81,900 divided by 20. Let's see, 80,000 divided by 20 is 4,000. 1,900 divided by 20 is 95. So 4,000 + 95 = 4,095. So the increase in the second year is 4,095.\n\nAdding that to 81,900 gives the population after two years. 81,900 + 4,095 equals... let me add. 81,900 + 4,000 is 85,900, then add the remaining 95: 85,995. So the population after two years is 85,995.\n\nNow, looking back at the options: A is 81,900 which is just after the first year. B is 85,995 which matches my calculation. C is 85,800, which is a bit lower. D is 90,000, way higher. E is none of these.\n\nSo the correct answer should be B. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a calculation mistake. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using a different method, like multiplying by 1.05 twice.\n\nSo starting with 78,000. Multiply by 1.05 for the first year: 78,000 * 1.05. Let me calculate that. 78,000 * 1 is 78,000. 78,000 * 0.05 is 3,900. So total is 81,900. Then, 81,900 * 1.05. Let me compute that again. 81,900 * 1 is 81,900. 81,900 * 0.05 is 4,095. Adding them gives 85,995. Yep, same result.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for compound interest, which is P = P0 * (1 + r)^t. Here, P0 is 78,000, r is 0.05, t is 2. So P = 78000 * (1.05)^2.\n\nCalculating (1.05)^2 is 1.1025. So 78,000 multiplied by 1.1025. Let's see, 78,000 * 1.1 is 85,800. Then 78,000 * 0.0025 is 195. So 85,800 + 195 = 85,995. Same answer again.\n\nSo the correct answer is 85,995, which is option B. So the answer should be B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about population growth. Hmm, let me think. The question says the population increases by 5% annually, and I need to find out what the population will be in two years from now. The current population is 78,000. The options are A to E, with E being none of these. \n\nAlright, so first, I remember that when something grows by a percentage each year, it's usually compound growth. So each year's increase is calculated on the new population, not the original. So I can't just add 5% twice on the original number; I need to apply it each year step by step.\n\nLet me write down the current population. It's 78,000. So in the first year, it increases by 5%. To find 5% of 78,000, I can calculate that. 5% is the same as 0.05 in decimal. So 78,000 multiplied by 0.05 equals... let me do the math. 78,000 * 0.05. Well, 78,000 divided by 20 (since 5% is 5 per 100, so 100/5 is 20). 78,000 divided by 20 is 3,900. So the increase in the first year is 3,900.\n\nAdding that to the original, the population after the first year would be 78,000 + 3,900 = 81,900. That's the population after one year. Now, the next year, it's another 5% increase on this new population.\n\nSo for the second year, I take 81,900 and calculate 5% of that. Again, 81,900 * 0.05. Let me compute that.

So the increase in the second year is 4,095.\n\nAdding that to 81,900 gives the population after two years. 81,900 + 4,095 equals... let me add. 81,900 + 4,000 is 85,900, then add the remaining 95: 85,995.
