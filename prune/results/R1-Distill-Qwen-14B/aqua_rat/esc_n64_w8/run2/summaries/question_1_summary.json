      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a car approaching a vertical tower. Hmm, let me try to visualize it. The car is moving in a straight line towards the base of the tower at a uniform speed. So it's going at a constant speed, which means the distance is decreasing at a steady rate.\n\nThe problem says that the top of the tower is observed from the car, and it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45 degrees to 60 degrees. I need to find out after how much more time the car will reach the base of the tower. The options are given, so I have to calculate and see which one matches.\n\nAlright, let's think about angles of elevation. When the car is far away, the angle is smaller, and as it gets closer, the angle increases. So when the angle is 45\u00b0, the car is farther away, and when it's 60\u00b0, it's closer. The time taken for this change is 10 minutes. Since the speed is uniform, the distance covered during this 10 minutes relates to the difference in the distances at these two angles.\n\nLet me denote the height of the tower as h. That's a constant because the tower's height doesn't change. When the angle is 45\u00b0, the distance from the car to the tower is d1, and when it's 60\u00b0, the distance is d2. So the car travels (d1 - d2) in 10 minutes. Since speed is uniform, the time taken to cover any distance can be found by dividing distance by speed.\n\nWait, but I don't know the speed. Maybe I can express everything in terms of h and the time. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, for the angle of elevation of 45\u00b0, I can use trigonometry. The tangent of the angle is opposite over adjacent. So tan(45\u00b0) = h / d1. Since tan(45\u00b0) is 1, that means d1 = h. Because 1 = h/d1 \u2192 d1 = h.\n\nNext, for the angle of 60\u00b0, tan(60\u00b0) is sqrt(3). So tan(60) = h/d2 \u2192 sqrt(3) = h/d2 \u2192 d2 = h / sqrt(3).\n\nSo the distance the car travels between these two observations is d1 - d2 = h - (h / sqrt(3)) = h (1 - 1/sqrt(3)). Let me compute that: 1 is about 1, 1/sqrt(3) is about 0.577. So 1 - 0.577 is about 0.423, so h*0.423.\n\nBut this distance is covered in 10 minutes. So the time taken to cover h (1 - 1/sqrt(3)) is 10 minutes. Let me write that as:\n\nTime = distance / speed \u2192 speed = distance / time.\n\nBut wait, I need to find the remaining time to reach the base after the angle is 60\u00b0. At 60\u00b0, the distance from the car to the tower is d2 = h / sqrt(3). So the time to cover d2 at the current speed would be (d2) / speed.\n\nBut I don't know the speed yet. Alternatively, since the car is moving at a constant speed, I can find the time it takes to cover d2 after the 10-minute mark.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me denote the speed as v. So v = (d1 - d2) / 10 minutes. So v = [h (1 - 1/sqrt(3))] / 10.\n\nBut the time to reach the base from the 60\u00b0 position is the distance d2 divided by speed v. So time = d2 / v.\n\nSubstituting d2 = h / sqrt(3) and v = [h (1 - 1/sqrt(3))] / 10.\n\nSo time = (h / sqrt(3)) / [ (h (1 - 1/sqrt(3))) / 10 ) ]\n\nLet's compute this. The h's will cancel out. So:\n\ntime = [1/sqrt(3)] / [ (1 - 1/sqrt(3)) / 10 ]\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\ntime = [1/sqrt(3)] * [10 / (1 - 1/sqrt(3)) ]\n\nSimplify the denominator: 1 - 1/sqrt(3) = (sqrt(3) - 1)/sqrt(3)\n\nSo substituting:\n\ntime = [1/sqrt(3)] * [10 * sqrt(3) / (sqrt(3) - 1) ) ]\n\nThe sqrt(3) in the numerator and denominator cancel out:\n\ntime = [1] * [10 / (sqrt(3) - 1) ]\n\nSo time = 10 / (sqrt(3) - 1). Hmm, but this expression can be rationalized.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (sqrt(3) + 1):\n\ntime = 10 (sqrt(3) + 1) / [ (sqrt(3) - 1)(sqrt(3) + 1) ) ]\n\nThe denominator becomes (3 -1) )= 2.\n\nSo time = 10 (sqrt(3) + 1) / 2 = 5 (sqrt(3) + 1) minutes.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 5(\u221a3 + 1). So that's the answer.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me double-check the steps.\n\n1. Calculated d1 = h, d2 = h/sqrt(3). Correct.\n2. Distance covered in 10 minutes: d1 -d2 = h (1 - 1/sqrt(3)). Correct.\n3. Speed v = (h (1 - 1/sqrt(3)) ) / 10. Correct.\n4. Time to reach base from d2 is d2 / v = (h/sqrt(3)) / [ (h (1 - 1/sqrt(3)) ) /10 ].\n\nYes, that's correct. The h cancels, and we end up with [1/sqrt(3)] * [10/(1 - 1/sqrt(3)) ].\n\nSimplify denominator as (sqrt(3) - 1)/sqrt(3), so reciprocal is sqrt(3)/(sqrt(3)-1). Multiply by 10 gives 10 sqrt(3) / (sqrt(3)-1). Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(3)+1 to get 10 (sqrt(3)(sqrt(3)+1 )) / (3-1) \u2192 10 (3 + sqrt(3)) / 2 \u2192 5 (3 + sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, in the previous step, the calculation after rationalizing was:\n\ntime = 10 (sqrt(3) + 1) / 2 \u2192 5 (sqrt(3)+1). Right.\n\nSo yes, the time after the 60\u00b0 angle is observed is 5 (sqrt(3)+1) minutes. So the correct option is A.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a car approaching a tower, and I need to find out how much more time it will take to reach the base after the angle of elevation changes from 45 degrees to 60 degrees. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nAlright, let's visualize the scenario. There's a vertical tower, and the car is moving towards it in a straight line at a uniform speed. So the speed is constant, which is good because that means the time is directly related to the distance covered.\n\nThe problem says that the angle of elevation changes from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 in 10 minutes. Wait, angle of elevation is the angle between the horizontal line from the observer and the line of sight to the top of the tower. So as the car gets closer, the angle increases.\n\nI remember that when dealing with angles of elevation, trigonometry, especially the tangent function, is useful. Because tangent of the angle is equal to the opposite side over the adjacent side in a right-angled triangle. So, in this case, the opposite side is the height of the tower, and the adjacent side is the distance from the car to the base of the tower.\n\nLet me denote the height of the tower as h. When the angle is 45\u00b0, the distance from the car to the base is d1. When the angle is 60\u00b0, the distance is d2. So, we can set up two equations using tangent.\n\nFor the first scenario, tan(45\u00b0) = h / d1. Since tan(45\u00b0) is 1, that simplifies to h = d1. So, d1 equals h.\n\nIn the second scenario, tan(60\u00b0) is sqrt(3), so sqrt(3) = h / d2. Therefore, d2 = h / sqrt(3).\n\nWait, so the car was initially at a distance d1 = h, then moved closer to d2 = h/sqrt(3). The distance it covered between those two points is d1 - d2, which is h - (h/sqrt(3)) = h (1 - 1/sqrt(3)). Let me compute that.\n\nHmm, 1/sqrt(3) is approximately 0.577, so 1 - 0.577 is about 0.423. So, the distance covered during those 10 minutes is h * 0.423. But wait, maybe I should keep it in exact terms instead of approximate numbers.\n\nSo, the distance covered in 10 minutes is h (1 - 1/sqrt(3)). Let me rationalize 1/sqrt(3) to make it sqrt(3)/3. So, 1 - sqrt(3)/3 is (3 - sqrt(3))/3. Therefore, the distance covered is h*(3 - sqrt(3))/3.\n\nSince the car is moving at a uniform speed, the time taken is proportional to the distance. So, the speed v is (distance) / (time). The distance during 10 minutes is h*(3 - sqrt(3))/3, and the time is 10 minutes. So, speed v = [h*(3 - sqrt(3))/3 ] / 10.\n\nWait, but we need to find the time it takes to go from d2 (h/sqrt(3)) to the base of the tower (distance 0). So, the remaining distance is d2, which is h/sqrt(3). So, the time taken to cover that distance would be (h/sqrt(3)) divided by the speed v.\n\nLet me write that down. Time t = (h/sqrt(3)) / v.\n\nSubstituting v from earlier:\n\nt = (h/sqrt(3)) / [ (h*(3 - sqrt(3))/(3*10) ) ]\n\nHmm, let's see. The h terms cancel out. So,\n\nt = (1/sqrt(3)) / [ (3 - sqrt(3))/(3*10) ) ]\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nt = [1/sqrt(3)] * [3*10/(3 - sqrt(3)) ]\n\nSimplify the numerator: 3*10 is 30. So,\n\nt = 30/(sqrt(3)*(3 - sqrt(3)) )\n\nI can rationalize the denominator. Let me multiply numerator and denominator by (3 + sqrt(3)) to eliminate the square root in the denominator.\n\nSo,\n\nt = [30*(3 + sqrt(3))] / [ sqrt(3)*(3 - sqrt(3))(3 + sqrt(3)) )\n\nThe denominator's denominator becomes sqrt(3) * (9 - 3) because (a-b)(a+b)=a\u00b2 -b\u00b2. So, 3\u00b2 is 9, (sqrt(3))\u00b2 is 3. So, 9-3 is 6.\n\nSo denominator is sqrt(3)*6.\n\nSo,\n\nt = [30*(3 + sqrt(3)) ] / [6*sqrt(3) ]\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n30 divided by 6 is 5.\n\nSo,\n\nt = 5*(3 + sqrt(3)) / sqrt(3)\n\nHmm, perhaps I can split the fraction.\n\nt = 5* [3/sqrt(3) + sqrt(3)/sqrt(3) ]\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n3/sqrt(3) is sqrt(3) because 3 is sqrt(3)*sqrt(3). Similarly, sqrt(3)/sqrt(3) is 1.\n\nSo,\n\nt = 5*(sqrt(3) + 1 )\n\nSo, the time is 5*(sqrt(3) + 1) minutes.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 5*(\u221a3 + 1), which matches. But let me double-check my steps because sometimes a small mistake can change everything.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n1. I found d1 = h, d2 = h/sqrt(3). So, the distance covered in 10 minutes is d1 - d2 = h - h/sqrt(3) = h(1 - 1/sqrt(3)).\n\n2. So, speed v = [h(1 - 1/sqrt(3))]/10.\n\n3. The remaining distance is d2 = h/sqrt(3). Time t = (h/sqrt(3)) / v.\n\nSubstituting v, t = (h/sqrt(3)) * [10 / (h(1 - 1/sqrt(3))) ) ].\n\nThe h cancels, so t = 10/( [1 - 1/sqrt(3)] * sqrt(3) )\n\nWait, let me compute [1 - 1/sqrt(3)] * sqrt(3). That would be sqrt(3) - 1.\n\nSo, t = 10/(sqrt(3) -1 )\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (sqrt(3) +1):\n\nt = 10*(sqrt(3) +1 ) / [ (sqrt(3)-1)(sqrt(3)+1) ) ]\n\nDenominator becomes 3 -1 =2.\n\nSo, t=10*(sqrt(3)+1)/2 =5*(sqrt(3)+1).\n\nAh, so the same result as before. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the time is 5*(sqrt(3)+1) minutes. Looking at the options, option A is 5(\u221a3 + 1), which matches.\n\nWait, but the question is asking \"after how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?\" So yes, the time after the angle changes from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0, so that's the time from when the angle was 60\u00b0, which is when the car is at d2.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a car approaching a tower, and I need to find out how much more time it will take to reach the base after the angle of elevation changes from 45 degrees to 60 degrees. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nAlright, let's visualize the scenario. There's a vertical tower, and the car is moving towards it in a straight line at a uniform speed. So the speed is constant, which is good because that means the time is directly related to the distance covered.\n\nThe problem says that the angle of elevation changes from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 in 10 minutes. Wait, angle of elevation is the angle between the horizontal line from the observer and the line of sight to the top of the tower. So as the car gets closer, the angle increases.\n\nI remember that when dealing with angles of elevation, trigonometry, especially the tangent function, is useful. Because tangent of the angle is equal to the opposite side over the adjacent side in a right-angled triangle. So, in this case, the opposite side is the height of the tower, and the adjacent side is the distance from the car to the base of the tower.\n\nLet me denote the height of the tower as h. When the angle is 45\u00b0, the distance from the car to the base is d1. When the angle is 60\u00b0, the distance is d2. So, we can set up two equations using tangent.\n\nFor the first scenario, tan(45\u00b0) = h / d1. Since tan(45\u00b0) is 1, that simplifies to h = d1. So, d1 equals h.\n\nIn the second scenario, tan(60\u00b0) is sqrt(3), so sqrt(3) = h / d2. Therefore, d2 = h / sqrt(3).\n\nWait, so the car was initially at a distance d1 = h, then moved closer to d2 = h/sqrt(3). The distance it covered between those two points is d1 - d2, which is h - (h/sqrt(3)) = h (1 - 1/sqrt(3)). Let me compute that.\n\nHmm, 1/sqrt(3) is approximately 0.577, so 1 - 0.577 is about 0.423. So, the distance covered during those 10 minutes is h * 0.423. But wait, maybe I should keep it in exact terms instead of approximate numbers.\n\nSo, the distance covered in 10 minutes is h (1 - 1/sqrt(3)). Let me rationalize 1/sqrt(3) to make it sqrt(3)/3. So, 1 - sqrt(3)/3 is (3 - sqrt(3))/3. Therefore, the distance covered is h*(3 - sqrt(3))/3.\n\nSince the car is moving at a uniform speed, the time taken is proportional to the distance. So, the speed v is (distance) / (time). The distance during 10 minutes is h*(3 - sqrt(3))/3, and the time is 10 minutes. So, speed v = [h*(3 - sqrt(3))/3 ] / 10.\n\nWait, but we need to find the time it takes to go from d2 (h/sqrt(3)) to the base of the tower (distance 0). So, the remaining distance is d2, which is h/sqrt(3). So, the time taken to cover that distance would be (h/sqrt(3)) divided by the speed v.\n\nLet me write that down. Time t = (h/sqrt(3)) / v.\n\nSubstituting v from earlier:\n\nt = (h/sqrt(3)) / [ (h*(3 - sqrt(3))/(3*10) ) ]\n\nHmm, let's see. The h terms cancel out. So,\n\nt = (1/sqrt(3)) / [ (3 - sqrt(3))/(3*10) ) ]\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nt = [1/sqrt(3)] * [3*10/(3 - sqrt(3)) ]\n\nSimplify the numerator: 3*10 is 30. So,\n\nt = 30/(sqrt(3)*(3 - sqrt(3)) )\n\nI can rationalize the denominator. Let me multiply numerator and denominator by (3 + sqrt(3)) to eliminate the square root in the denominator.\n\nSo,\n\nt = [30*(3 + sqrt(3))] / [ sqrt(3)*(3 - sqrt(3))(3 + sqrt(3)) )\n\nThe denominator's denominator becomes sqrt(3) * (9 - 3) because (a-b)(a+b)=a\u00b2 -b\u00b2. So, 3\u00b2 is 9, (sqrt(3))\u00b2 is 3. So, 9-3 is 6.\n\nSo denominator is sqrt(3)*6.\n\nSo,\n\nt = [30*(3 + sqrt(3)) ] / [6*sqrt(3) ]\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n30 divided by 6 is 5.\n\nSo,\n\nt = 5*(3 + sqrt(3)) / sqrt(3)\n\nHmm, perhaps I can split the fraction.\n\nt = 5* [3/sqrt(3) + sqrt(3)/sqrt(3) ]\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n3/sqrt(3) is sqrt(3) because 3 is sqrt(3)*sqrt(3). Similarly, sqrt(3)/sqrt(3) is 1.\n\nSo,\n\nt = 5*(sqrt(3) + 1 )\n\nSo, the time is 5*(sqrt(3) + 1) minutes.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 5*(\u221a3 + 1), which matches. But let me double-check my steps because sometimes a small mistake can change everything.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n1. I found d1 = h, d2 = h/sqrt(3). So, the distance covered in 10 minutes is d1 - d2 = h - h/sqrt(3) = h(1 - 1/sqrt(3)).\n\n2. So, speed v = [h(1 - 1/sqrt(3))]/10.\n\n3. The remaining distance is d2 = h/sqrt(3). Time t = (h/sqrt(3)) / v.\n\nSubstituting v, t = (h/sqrt(3)) * [10 / (h(1 - 1/sqrt(3))) ) ].\n\nThe h cancels, so t = 10/( [1 - 1/sqrt(3)] * sqrt(3) )\n\nWait, let me compute [1 - 1/sqrt(3)] * sqrt(3). That would be sqrt(3) - 1.\n\nSo, t = 10/(sqrt(3) -1 )\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (sqrt(3) +1):\n\nt = 10*(sqrt(3) +1 ) / [ (sqrt(3)-1)(sqrt(3)+1) ) ]\n\nDenominator becomes 3 -1 =2.\n\nSo, t=10*(sqrt(3)+1)/2 =5*(sqrt(3)+1).\n\nAh, so the same result as before. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the time is 5*(sqrt(3)+1) minutes. Looking at the options, option A is 5(\u221a3 + 1), which matches.\n\nWait, but the question is asking \"after how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?\" So yes, the time after the angle changes from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0, so that's the time from when the angle was 60\u00b0, which is when the car is at d2.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the scenario using trigonometry. The car is moving towards the base of a vertical tower at a uniform speed, and the angle of elevation changes from \\(45^\\circ\\) to \\(60^\\circ\\) in 10 minutes. We need to determine the additional time required for the car to reach the base of the tower after the angle reaches \\(60^\\circ\\).\n\n### Step 1: Relating distances to the tower\nLet the height of the tower be \\(h\\).

Using \\(\\tan(60^\\circ) = \\sqrt{3}\\), we find:\n\\[\nd_2 = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\nThe distance covered by the car during the 10 minutes is:\n\\[\nd_1 - d_2 = h - \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}} = h \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculating the speed of the car\nThe speed \\(v\\) of the car is given by:\n\\[\nv = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}} = \\frac{h \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)}{10}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Time to reach the base of the tower\nThe remaining distance to the base of the tower after the angle reaches \\(60^\\circ\\) is \\(d_2 = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}}\\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a car approaching a tower. Let me try to picture it. The car is moving straight towards the base of a vertical tower at a constant speed. From the car, someone is observing the top of the tower, and the angle of elevation changes from 45 degrees to 60 degrees over 10 minutes. The question is asking how much more time the car will take to reach the base after this observation period.\n\nHmm, I remember that angle of elevation problems usually involve right triangles. So, the tower is vertical, which means we can model this with two right triangles at two different points in time. The first triangle is when the angle is 45 degrees, and the second is when it's 60 degrees.\n\nLet me denote the height of the tower as 'h'. The car is moving towards the tower, so as it gets closer, the angle of elevation increases. The distance from the car to the tower will decrease over time.\n\nAt the first observation, the angle is 45 degrees. So, in that case, the tangent of 45 degrees is equal to the opposite side (h) over the adjacent side (distance from car to tower at that point, let's call it d1). Since tan(45) is 1, that means h = d1. So d1 = h.\n\nThen, after 10 minutes, the angle becomes 60 degrees. So, the tangent of 60 degrees is sqrt(3), and that equals h over d2. So, h = d2 * sqrt(3). So d2 = h / sqrt(3).\n\nWait, but the car is moving towards the tower, so the distance decreases. So the initial distance is d1, and after 10 minutes, it's d2. So the distance covered in those 10 minutes is d1 - d2. Because the car is moving closer.\n\nSo substituting the values I have:\n\nd1 = h\n\nd2 = h / sqrt(3)\n\nSo the distance covered in 10 minutes is h - (h / sqrt(3)) = h (1 - 1/sqrt(3)).\n\nLet me compute 1 - 1/sqrt(3). Well, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so 1/sqrt(3) is about 0.577. So 1 - 0.577 is 0.423. But exact value would be better.\n\nSo, the distance covered in 10 minutes is h ( (sqrt(3) - 1)/sqrt(3) ), because 1 - 1/sqrt(3) = (sqrt(3) - 1)/sqrt(3). Let me check that:\n\n1 = sqrt(3)/sqrt(3), so 1 - 1/sqrt(3) = (sqrt(3) - 1)/sqrt(3). Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the car's speed can be calculated. Let's denote speed as v. The distance covered is speed multiplied by time. So:\n\nh ( (sqrt(3) -1 ) / sqrt(3) ) = v * 10 minutes.\n\nBut wait, time is in minutes, and I'm assuming the speed is in some consistent units. I can express 10 minutes as 10/60 hours, but maybe it's better to work in minutes for time and perhaps meters per minute as speed.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to find the time required to cover the remaining distance after the 10 minutes. Because the question is asking for how much more time will the car take to reach the base after the 10 minutes.\n\nSo after the 10 minutes, the distance from the car to the tower is d2 = h / sqrt(3). So the remaining distance is d2, and the time needed to cover that is (d2) / v.\n\nWait, but I can express v in terms of h. Let me see.\n\nFrom the first part:\n\nv = [ h (sqrt(3) -1 ) / sqrt(3) ) ] / 10.\n\nSo v = h (sqrt(3) -1 ) / (10 * sqrt(3)).\n\nNow, the remaining distance is d2 = h / sqrt(3). So the time needed is (h / sqrt(3)) / v.\n\nSubstituting v:\n\nTime = [ (h / sqrt(3)) ] / [ h (sqrt(3)-1)/(10 sqrt(3)) ) ]\n\nLet me compute this.\n\nThe h cancels out. So numerator is (1/sqrt(3)), denominator is (sqrt(3)-1)/(10 sqrt(3)).\n\nSo, Time = [ (1/sqrt(3)) ] * [10 sqrt(3) / (sqrt(3)-1) ) ]\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n(1/sqrt(3)) * (10 sqrt(3)) = 10.\n\nSo Time = 10 / (sqrt(3)-1).\n\nHmm, wait. So the time after the 10 minutes is 10/(sqrt(3)-1) minutes.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because the denominator is less than 2, so the time would be more than 5 minutes. Let me check the steps again.\n\nWait, let's recompute the time after the 10 minutes.\n\nThe remaining distance is d2 = h / sqrt(3). The speed v is h (sqrt(3)-1)/(10 sqrt(3)).\n\nSo time t = (h / sqrt(3)) / [ h (sqrt(3)-1)/(10 sqrt(3)) ) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\nh cancels. So (1/sqrt(3)) * [10 sqrt(3) / (sqrt(3) -1) ) ]\n\nWhich is (10 sqrt(3) )/( sqrt(3) * (sqrt(3) -1) )\n\nWait, sqrt(3) in numerator and denominator cancels. So 10 / (sqrt(3) -1).\n\nAh, okay, so 10/(sqrt(3)-1). To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by (sqrt(3)+1):\n\n10 (sqrt(3)+1) / [ (sqrt(3)-1)(sqrt(3)+1) ) ] \n\nDenominator becomes (3 -1) )=2.\n\nSo Time = [10 (sqrt(3)+1) ] / 2 = 5 (sqrt(3) +1).\n\nWait, so the time after the 10 minutes is 5 (sqrt(3)+1) minutes. But looking at the options, option A is 5(\u221a3 +1). So that's one of the options.\n\nWait, but wait. The question is: After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? So the answer is 5(\u221a3 +1) minutes, which is option A.\n\nWait, but I thought the time after the 10 minutes is that, but let me double-check.\n\nWait, let me re-express the entire problem.\n\nThe car is moving towards the tower at a uniform speed. So the speed is constant.\n\nAt time t=0, angle is 45 degrees, so distance is d1 = h.\n\nAfter 10 minutes (t=10), angle is 60 degrees, distance is d2 = h / sqrt(3).\n\nSo the distance covered in 10 minutes is d1 - d2 = h - (h / sqrt(3)) = h (1 - 1/sqrt(3)).\n\nSo speed v = [h (1 - 1/sqrt(3)) ] / 10.\n\nNow, the remaining distance after 10 minutes is d2 = h / sqrt(3).\n\nTime to cover d2 is t = d2 / v.\n\nSubstituting v:\n\nt = [ h / sqrt(3) ] / [ h (1 - 1/sqrt(3)) / 10 ]\n\nh cancels, so:\n\nt = [ 1/sqrt(3) ] / [ (1 - 1/sqrt(3)) / 10 ]\n\nWhich is t = [1/sqrt(3)] * [10 / ( (sqrt(3) -1)/sqrt(3) ) ) ]\n\nWait, because 1 -1/sqrt(3) is (sqrt(3)-1)/sqrt(3). So 1/(1 - 1/sqrt(3)) = sqrt(3)/(sqrt(3) -1).\n\nSo t = [1/sqrt(3)] * 10 * [sqrt(3)/(sqrt(3) -1)] )\n\nSimplify:\n\n1/sqrt(3) * sqrt(3) = 1. So t = 10 * 1 / (sqrt(3) -1 )\n\nWhich again is 10/(sqrt(3)-1) = 5(\u221a3 +1) as before.\n\nSo the correct answer is option A, which is 5(\u221a3 +1) minutes.\n",

Let me see.\n\nFrom the first part:\n\nv = [ h (sqrt(3) -1 ) / sqrt(3) ) ] / 10.\n\nSo v = h (sqrt(3) -1 ) / (10 * sqrt(3)).\n\nNow, the remaining distance is d2 = h / sqrt(3). So the time needed is (h / sqrt(3)) / v.\n\nSubstituting v:\n\nTime = [ (h / sqrt(3)) ] / [ h (sqrt(3)-1)/(10 sqrt(3)) ) ]\n\nLet me compute this.\n\nThe h cancels out. So numerator is (1/sqrt(3)), denominator is (sqrt(3)-1)/(10 sqrt(3)).\n\nSo, Time = [ (1/sqrt(3)) ] * [10 sqrt(3) / (sqrt(3)-1) ) ]\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n(1/sqrt(3)) * (10 sqrt(3)) = 10.\n\nSo Time = 10 / (sqrt(3)-1).\n\nHmm, wait. So the time after the 10 minutes is 10/(sqrt(3)-1) minutes.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because the denominator is less than 2, so the time would be more than 5 minutes. Let me check the steps again.\n\nWait, let's recompute the time after the 10 minutes.\n\nThe remaining distance is d2 = h / sqrt(3). The speed v is h (sqrt(3)-1)/(10 sqrt(3)).\n\nSo time t = (h / sqrt(3)) / [ h (sqrt(3)-1)/(10 sqrt(3)) ) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\nh cancels. So (1/sqrt(3)) * [10 sqrt(3) / (sqrt(3) -1) ) ]\n\nWhich is (10 sqrt(3) )/( sqrt(3) * (sqrt(3) -1) )\n\nWait, sqrt(3) in numerator and denominator cancels. So 10 / (sqrt(3) -1).\n\nAh, okay, so 10/(sqrt(3)-1). To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by (sqrt(3)+1):\n\n10 (sqrt(3)+1) / [ (sqrt(3)-1)(sqrt(3)+1) ) ] \n\nDenominator becomes (3 -1) )=2.\n\nSo Time = [10 (sqrt(3)+1) ] / 2 = 5 (sqrt(3) +1).\n\nWait, so the time after the 10 minutes is 5 (sqrt(3)+1) minutes. But looking at the options, option A is 5(\u221a3 +1). So that's one of the options.\n\nWait, but wait. The question is: After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? So the answer is 5(\u221a3 +1) minutes, which is option A.\n\nWait, but I thought the time after the 10 minutes is that, but let me double-check.\n\nWait, let me re-express the entire problem.\n\nThe car is moving towards the tower at a uniform speed. So the speed is constant.\n\nAt time t=0, angle is 45 degrees, so distance is d1 = h.\n\nAfter 10 minutes (t=10), angle is 60 degrees, distance is d2 = h / sqrt(3).\n\nSo the distance covered in 10 minutes is d1 - d2 = h - (h / sqrt(3)) = h (1 - 1/sqrt(3)).\n\nSo speed v = [h (1 - 1/sqrt(3)) ] / 10.\n\nNow, the remaining distance after 10 minutes is d2 = h / sqrt(3).\n\nTime to cover d2 is t = d2 / v.\n\nSubstituting v:\n\nt = [ h / sqrt(3) ] / [ h (1 - 1/sqrt(3)) / 10 ]\n\nh cancels, so:\n\nt = [ 1/sqrt(3) ] / [ (1 - 1/sqrt(3)) / 10 ]\n\nWhich is t = [1/sqrt(3)] * [10 / ( (sqrt(3) -1)/sqrt(3) ) ) ]\n\nWait, because 1 -1/sqrt(3) is (sqrt(3)-1)/sqrt(3). So 1/(1 - 1/sqrt(3)) = sqrt(3)/(sqrt(3) -1).\n\nSo t = [1/sqrt(3)] * 10 * [sqrt(3)/(sqrt(3) -1)] )\n\nSimplify:\n\n1/sqrt(3) * sqrt(3) = 1. So t = 10 * 1 / (sqrt(3) -1 )\n\nWhich again is 10/(sqrt(3)-1) = 5(\u221a3 +1) as before.\n\nSo the correct answer is option A, which is 5(\u221a3 +1) minutes.\n\n\nThe problem involves a car moving towards the base of a vertical tower at a constant speed. Initially, the angle of elevation to the top of the tower is 45\u00b0, and after 10 minutes, it increases to 60\u00b0. The goal is to determine how much more time the car will take to reach the base of the tower after the angle changes to 60\u00b0.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the geometry\n- Let the height of the tower be \\( h \\).\n- At 45\u00b0, the distance from the car to the tower is \\( d_1 = h \\) (since \\( \\tan(45^\\circ) = 1 \\)).\n- At 60\u00b0, the distance from the car to the tower is \\( d_2 = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}} \\) (since \\( \\tan(60^\\circ) = \\sqrt{3} \\)).\n- The distance covered by the car in 10 minutes is \\( d_1 - d_2 = h - \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}} = h \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) \\).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the car's speed\nThe car's speed \\( v \\) is given by:\n\\[\nv = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}} = \\frac{h \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)}{10}.\n\\]\nSimplify \\( 1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\):\n\\[\n1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} - 1}{\\sqrt{3}}.\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\nv = \\frac{h (\\sqrt{3} - 1)}{10 \\sqrt{3}}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Determine the remaining time\nAfter 10 minutes, the car is at a distance \\( d_2 = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}} \\) from the tower. The time \\( t \\) to cover this remaining distance is:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{d_2}{v} = \\frac{\\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}}}{\\frac{h (\\sqrt{3} - 1)}{10 \\sqrt{3}}}.\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3} - 1}{10 \\sqrt{3}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{10 \\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3} - 1}.\n\\]\nCancel \\( \\sqrt{3} \\) in the numerator and denominator:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3} - 1}.\n\\]\nRationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by \\( \\sqrt{3} + 1 \\):\n\\[\nt = \\frac{10 (\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\\sqrt{3} - 1)(\\sqrt{3} + 1)} = \\frac{10 (\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1} = \\frac{10 (\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{2}.\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\\[\nt = 5 (\\sqrt{3} + 1).\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe car will take \\( 5 (\\sqrt{3} + 1) \\) minutes to reach the base of the tower after the angle changes to 60\u00b0. This corresponds to **Option A**.\n\n**Answer: A**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a car approaching a vertical tower. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The car is moving in a straight line at a uniform speed, so that means it's moving at a constant velocity. The top of the tower is being observed from the car, and it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45 degrees to 60 degrees. The question is asking after how much more time the car will reach the base of the tower.\n\nAlright, I remember that when dealing with angles of elevation and distances, trigonometry, especially the tangent function, is useful. Let me try to visualize this scenario. There's a vertical tower, and the car is moving towards its base. At a certain point, the angle of elevation to the top of the tower is 45 degrees, and after some time (10 minutes), this angle increases to 60 degrees. I need to find the time it takes from that point until the car reaches the base.\n\nWait, wait. So the car is moving towards the tower, so the distance from the car to the tower is decreasing. As the car gets closer, the angle of elevation increases because the car is getting closer to the base, making the line of sight steeper.\n\nLet me set up some variables. Let's denote the height of the tower as h. That's a constant because the tower isn't changing. The car's speed is uniform, so let's call the speed v. But since we're dealing with time, maybe it's easier to work with distance and figure out the time based on that.\n\nAt the first observation, when the angle is 45 degrees, let's say the distance from the car to the base of the tower is d1. Using the tangent function, tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent. So for 45 degrees, tan(45) = h / d1. But tan(45) is 1, so h = d1.\n\nThen, after some time, the angle becomes 60 degrees. Let's say the distance at this point is d2. So tan(60) = h / d2. I know that tan(60) is \u221a3, so h = \u221a3 * d2. Therefore, d2 = h / \u221a3.\n\nWait, but I also know that h = d1, from the first part. So substituting, d2 = d1 / \u221a3.\n\nBut wait, the car is moving towards the tower, so the distance decreases. So d1 is the initial distance, and after some time, it's now d2, which is less than d1. So the distance covered during those 10 minutes is d1 - d2. Since the car is moving at a uniform speed, the time taken to cover that distance is 10 minutes.\n\nSo, time = (d1 - d2) / v = 10 minutes. But I don't know v. Hmm. Maybe I can express v in terms of d1 and d2.\n\nWait, since d1 = h and d2 = h/\u221a3, then d1 - d2 = h - h/\u221a3 = h (1 - 1/\u221a3) = h (\u221a3 - 1)/\u221a3.\n\nSo, the distance covered in 10 minutes is h (\u221a3 -1)/\u221a3.\n\nBut the speed v is distance over time. So v = [h (\u221a3 -1)/\u221a3 ] / 10.\n\nNow, after the angle becomes 60 degrees, the car is at a distance d2 from the tower. How much more time will it take to reach the base? Well, the remaining distance is d2, which is h/\u221a3. So the time taken to cover d2 at speed v is t = d2 / v.\n\nSubstituting d2 = h/\u221a3 and v = [h (\u221a3 -1)/(\u221a3 * 10) ], we get:\n\nt = [h / \u221a3 ] / [ h (\u221a3 -1) / ( \u221a3 * 10 ) ]\n\nWait, let's compute this step by step. So numerator is h/(\u221a3). Denominator is [h (sqrt3 -1)]/(sqrt3 * 10).\n\nSo t = [h/(\u221a3)] / [h (sqrt3 -1)/(sqrt3 * 10) ]\n\nThe h's cancel out. So we're left with:\n\nt = [1/(\u221a3)] / [ (sqrt3 -1) / (sqrt3 * 10) ]\n\nDividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So:\n\nt = [1/(\u221a3)] * [ sqrt3 *10 / (sqrt3 -1) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\nThe sqrt3 in the numerator and denominator cancels out the 1/sqrt3, so:\n\nt = [1 * 10 * sqrt3 ] / ( sqrt3 -1 ) * (1/(sqrt3)) )? Wait, maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, let's redo the division:\n\n[1/(\u221a3)] * [ sqrt3 *10 / (sqrt3 -1) ].\n\nThe sqrt3 in the numerator and denominator will cancel. So:\n\nt = [1/(\u221a3)] * [10 sqrt3 / (sqrt3 -1) ) ]\n\nThe sqrt3 in denominator and numerator cancel, so:\n\nt = [1] * [10 / (sqrt3 -1) ]\n\nSo t = 10 / (sqrt3 -1 )\n\nBut wait, we can rationalize the denominator. Multiply numerator and denominator by (sqrt3 +1):\n\nt = [10 (sqrt3 +1) ] / [ (sqrt3 -1)(sqrt3 +1) ) ]\n\nDenominator becomes (3 -1) = 2.\n\nSo t = 10 (sqrt3 +1) / 2 = 5 (sqrt3 +1 )\n\nHmm, so that's 5 multiplied by (sqrt3 +1) minutes.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 5(\u221a3 + 1). So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me just double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the two angles, 45 and 60 degrees. Calculated h = d1, d2 = h/sqrt3. Then, the distance covered during the 10 minutes is d1 -d2 = h (1 - 1/sqrt3) = h (sqrt3 -1)/sqrt3.\n\nThen, speed v = (d1 -d2) /10 = [h (sqrt3 -1)/sqrt3 ] /10.\n\nThen, the remaining distance is d2 = h/sqrt3.\n\nTime to cover d2 is d2 /v = [h/sqrt3 ] / [h (sqrt3 -1)/(10 sqrt3) ]\n\nWhich simplifies to [1/sqrt3 ] * [10 sqrt3/(sqrt3 -1) ].\n\nWait, the sqrt3 in denominator and numerator cancel, so 1/sqrt3 * 10 sqrt3 is 10.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, [1/sqrt3 ] multiplied by [10 sqrt3/(sqrt3 -1) ] equals [10 sqrt3 / (sqrt3 (sqrt3 -1) ) ].\n\nWait, the sqrt3 in numerator and denominator cancel, so 10/(sqrt3 -1). Then, rationalizing gives 5 (sqrt3 +1). So yes, correct.\n\nSo the answer should be option A.\n",

Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says a car is moving towards the base of a vertical tower in a straight line at a uniform speed. The top of the tower is observed from the car, and it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45 degrees to 60 degrees. We need to find out after how much more time the car will reach the base of the tower.\n\nHmm, right. So, the car is moving towards the tower, and as it does, the angle of elevation from the car to the top of the tower increases from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. The time taken for this change is 10 minutes. We're to find the additional time needed to reach the base.\n\nI remember that when dealing with angles of elevation and distances, trigonometric relationships, especially the tangent function, are useful. Let me visualize this scenario.\n\nLet's denote the height of the tower as h. That's a constant here because the tower's height doesn't change. When the angle of elevation is 45\u00b0, the distance from the car to the base of the tower is, say, d1. Similarly, when the angle becomes 60\u00b0, the distance is d2. Since the car is moving towards the tower, d2 must be less than d1.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, no, as the car approaches, the angle increases, so when the angle is 45\u00b0, the distance is larger, and when it's 60\u00b0, the distance is smaller. So yes, d1 is the initial distance when the angle is 45\u00b0, and d2 is the distance when the angle is 60\u00b0.\n\nSo, the car travels from d1 to d2 in 10 minutes. And we need to find the time it takes to go from d2 to 0 (the base of the tower), but wait, actually, no. Wait, wait a second. No, because from d2, the car is closer, but it's still not at the base. The base is at 0 distance. So the time taken to go from d1 to d2 is 10 minutes, and we need to find the time from d2 to 0. Or wait, no, wait the question is: After how much more time will the car reach the base? So the time from the current point (after d2) to the base is what's being asked.\n\nWait, let me think. The car is moving towards the tower, and during the time when the angle changes from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0, it covers the distance from d1 to d2, taking 10 minutes. So we can calculate the speed of the car, and then find out how much time it takes to go from d2 to 0, which is the remaining distance.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo let's model this.\n\nFirst, using the angles and the height of the tower, we can find d1 and d2.\n\nWhen the angle is 45\u00b0, tan(theta) = h / d1.\n\nSo tan(45) = 1 = h / d1 \u2192 d1 = h.\n\nSimilarly, when the angle is 60\u00b0, tan(60) = \u221a3 = h / d2 \u2192 d2 = h / \u221a3.\n\nWait, so d1 is h, and d2 is h / \u221a3. Since the car is moving towards the tower, the distance decreases, so the car has traveled (d1 - d2) in 10 minutes.\n\nCalculating d1 - d2: h - (h / \u221a3) = h (1 - 1/\u221a3) = h (\u221a3 - 1)/\u221a3. Wait, let me compute that again. Hmm.\n\nWait, 1 - 1/\u221a3 is the same as (\u221a3 - 1)/\u221a3. So, d1 - d2 = h (\u221a3 - 1)/\u221a3.\n\nBut I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute d1 and d2 separately.\n\nd1 = h / tan(45) = h / 1 = h.\n\nd2 = h / tan(60) = h / \u221a3.\n\nSo the distance covered in 10 minutes is d1 - d2 = h - h/\u221a3 = h (1 - 1/\u221a3) = h (\u221a3 - 1)/\u221a3.\n\nBut wait, wait, is that correct? Because when the car moves from d1 to d2, it's moving closer, so the distance covered is d1 - d2, which is positive.\n\nSo, the speed of the car is (d1 - d2) divided by the time taken, which is 10 minutes. But wait, speed is in distance per unit time. So the speed v = (h (\u221a3 - 1)/\u221a3) / 10.\n\nBut wait, 10 minutes is 10/60 hours, but perhaps it's better to work in minutes for time, but let's see.\n\nWait, the time is given in minutes, and the answer options are in terms of minutes, so perhaps we can keep time in minutes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to work in terms of distance and time, then find the remaining time.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to find the time it takes for the car to go from d2 to the base. Let's denote that time as t.\n\nSo, the distance from d2 to the base is d2, which is h / \u221a3.\n\nThe speed of the car is v = (d1 - d2) / 10.\n\nSo, v = [h - (h/\u221a3)] / 10 = h(1 - 1/\u221a3)/10.\n\nThen, the time to cover d2 at speed v is t = d2 / v.\n\nSubstituting, d2 is h/\u221a3, and v is [h(\u221a3 - 1)/\u221a3 ] / 10.\n\nWait, let me compute v again.\n\nWait, d1 is h, d2 is h/\u221a3.\n\nd1 - d2 = h - h/\u221a3 = h (1 - 1/\u221a3) = h (\u221a3 -1)/\u221a3.\n\nSo v = (h (\u221a3 -1)/\u221a3) / (10 minutes).\n\nSo, v = h (\u221a3 -1) / (10\u221a3) per minute.\n\nNow, the time to cover the remaining distance from d2 to base is t = (d2) / v.\n\nd2 is h/\u221a3.\n\nSo t = (h/\u221a3) / [ h(\u221a3 -1)/(10\u221a3) ) ]\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nh cancels out.\n\n(1/\u221a3) divided by ( (\u221a3 -1)/(10\u221a3) )\n\nWhich is same as (1/\u221a3) * [10\u221a3 / (\u221a3 -1) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n1/\u221a3 multiplied by 10\u221a3 is (10\u221a3 ) / (\u221a3 * (\u221a3 -1)) )\n\nThe \u221a3 in numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\n10 / (\u221a3 -1 )\n\nBut this is the time t.\n\nBut wait, 10/(\u221a3 -1) can be rationalized.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (\u221a3 +1):\n\nt = [10 (\u221a3 +1) ] / [ (\u221a3 -1)(\u221a3 +1) ) ]\n\nDenominator becomes ( (\u221a3)^2 -1^2 ) = 3-1=2.\n\nSo t = [10 (\u221a3 +1) ] / 2 = 5 (\u221a3 +1 )\n\nSo the time is 5(\u221a3 +1 ) minutes.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 5(\u221a3 +1 ), which matches.\n\nBut wait, let me check the calculation again because I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, let me go back.\n\nWait, the car has already covered the distance from d1 to d2 in 10 minutes, so the time to reach the base from d2 is the time for the remaining distance, which is d2, at speed v.\n\nSo, speed v = (d1 - d2)/10.\n\nBut the remaining distance is d2, so time t = d2 / v.\n\nSubstituting v:\n\nt = d2 / [ (d1 - d2)/10 ]\n\nWhich is t = (d2 * 10 ) / (d1 - d2 )\n\nWe have d1 = h, d2 = h/\u221a3.\n\nSo substituting:\n\nt = ( (h/\u221a3) * 10 ) / ( h - h/\u221a3 )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 10h /\u221a3.\n\nDenominator: h (1 - 1/\u221a3 ) = h ( (\u221a3 -1)/\u221a3 )\n\nSo t = [10h/\u221a3 ] / [ h (\u221a3 -1)/\u221a3 ) ]\n\nThe h cancels, and \u221a3 in numerator and denominator cancels.\n\nSo t = 10 / (\u221a3 -1 )\n\nWhich is same as before, and after rationalizing:\n\nt = 5(\u221a3 +1 )\n\nSo that would be option A.\n\nWait, but wait, the answer options have option A as 5(\u221a3 +1), which is what I'm getting.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The question says the angle changes from 45 to 60 degrees in 10 minutes. So in that time, the car moves from d1 to d2. So the time taken to cover that distance is 10 minutes.\n\nNow, the remaining distance is from d2 to 0, which is d2.\n\nSo, the time to cover d2 at speed v is t = d2 / v.\n\nBut wait, v is (d1 - d2)/10.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nt = d2 / [ (d1 - d2)/10 ]\n\nWhich is t = (d2 *10 ) / (d1 -d2 )\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo yes, t is 5(\u221a3 +1 ), which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 5(\u221a3 +1), which is correct.\n\nBut wait, let me think about the setup again. Did I mix up d1 and d2?\n\nNo, because when the car is farther away, the angle is smaller. So when the angle is 45\u00b0, it's farther, d1 = h. When the angle is 60\u00b0, it's closer, d2 = h/\u221a3. So, the car moves from d1 to d2 in 10 minutes. So the distance covered is d1 - d2 = h - h/\u221a3.\n\nWait, but wait, no: the distance covered is d1 minus d2, but that's the distance between the two points. So the car's speed is (d1 -d2)/10.\n\nBut when the car is at d2, how much further does it have to go? It has to go d2 more meters.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the distance from d2 to the base is d2. So yes, the time is t = d2 / v.\n\nSo, everything checks out.\n\nBut wait, let me think about whether the calculation was correct.\n\nWait, h is the height of the tower. But since h is the same in both cases, the h cancels out in the equations, which is why we don't need the actual value of h.\n\nSo, the final answer is 5(\u221a3 +1) minutes, which is option A.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about a car moving towards a tower and the changing angle of elevation. Hmm, I remember that when an object is moving towards a fixed point, the angle of elevation from that object changes over time. \n\nThe problem says the car is moving in a straight line at a uniform speed towards the base of a vertical tower. Initially, the angle of elevation to the top of the tower is 45 degrees, and then it changes to 60 degrees after 10 minutes. We need to find out how much more time the car will take to reach the base after this 10-minute interval.\n\nLet me visualize this. The tower is vertical, so let's denote its height as h meters. When the car is at some distance from the tower, the angle of elevation is 45 degrees. Then, as the car moves closer, the angle increases to 60 degrees after 10 minutes. After that, we have to find the time taken for the car to reach the base from this point.\n\nI think I can model this using trigonometry. The angle of elevation relates the height of the tower to the distance from the car to the base. \n\nLet me denote:\n- The height of the tower as h.\n- The initial distance from the car to the tower when the angle is 45 degrees as d1.\n- The distance after 10 minutes when the angle becomes 60 degrees as d2.\n- The speed of the car as v (constant, since it's uniform speed).\n\nSo, from trigonometry, when the angle is 45 degrees:\ntan(45\u00b0) = h / d1. Since tan(45) is 1, this gives h = d1.\n\nWhen the angle is 60 degrees:\ntan(60\u00b0) = h / d2. Tan(60) is \u221a3, so h = d2 * \u221a3.\n\nBut wait, from the first equation, h = d1, so substituting into the second equation: d1 = d2 * \u221a3. Which means d2 = d1 / \u221a3.\n\nSo the car has moved from d1 to d2 in 10 minutes. The distance covered in that time is d1 - d2 = d1 - (d1 / \u221a3) = d1 (1 - 1/\u221a3).\n\nThe speed v is distance over time. So v = [d1 (1 - 1/\u221a3)] / 10 minutes.\n\nBut wait, we need the time it takes to go from d2 to the base. The remaining distance is d2. Since the car is moving at speed v, the time t is d2 / v.\n\nLet me compute t:\n\nt = d2 / v.\n\nWe know that v = [d1 (1 - 1/\u221a3)] / 10.\n\nSo substituting:\n\nt = d2 / ( [d1 (1 - 1/\u221a3)] / 10 )\n\nBut d2 is d1 / \u221a3, so:\n\nt = (d1 / \u221a3 ) / ( [d1 (1 - 1/\u221a3)] / 10 )\n\nThe d1 terms cancel out:\n\nt = (1/\u221a3) / ( (1 - 1/\u221a3)/10 )\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n\n1 - 1/\u221a3 = (\u221a3 -1)/\u221a3.\n\nSo,\n\nt = (1/\u221a3) / [ (\u221a3 -1)/(\u221a3 * 10) ) ]\n\nWhich is (1/\u221a3) * [ \u221a3 * 10 / (\u221a3 -1) ) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\nThe \u221a3 in the numerator and denominator cancel out. So:\n\nt = 10 / (\u221a3 - 1)\n\nBut wait, the denominator is \u221a3 -1. To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by (\u221a3 +1):\n\nt = [10 (\u221a3 +1)] / [ (\u221a3 -1)(\u221a3 +1) ]\n\nThe denominator becomes (\u221a3)^2 - (1)^2 = 3 -1 = 2.\n\nSo,\n\nt = [10 (\u221a3 +1)] / 2 = 5 (\u221a3 +1) minutes.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 5(\u221a3 +1), which matches. But wait, let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, the problem says after the angle changes from 45 to 60 degrees in 10 minutes, how much more time to reach the base. So the time I calculated is t, which is 5(\u221a3 +1). So that's the correct answer.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 5(\u221a3 +1). So the answer should be A.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about a car approaching a tower. Hmm, let me read the question again.\n\nThe car is moving straight at a uniform speed towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car, and it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45 degrees to 60 degrees. We need to find out how much more time it will take for the car to reach the base after these observations.\n\nWait, I think this is a trigonometry problem involving angles of elevation. So, when the car is at a certain distance from the tower, the angle to the top is 45 degrees, and then after some time, it becomes 60 degrees. The time taken for this change is 10 minutes, and we need the time remaining.\n\nI remember that when dealing with angles of elevation, we can model this with right triangles. Let me visualize this: the tower is vertical, so its height is fixed. The car is moving along the ground towards the base, so the distance from the car to the tower's base decreases over time.\n\nLet me denote the height of the tower as 'h'. When the angle is 45 degrees, the distance from the car to the tower's base is, let's say, 'd1'. When the angle becomes 60 degrees, the distance is 'd2'. Since the car is moving towards the tower, d2 is less than d1.\n\nWait, wait, actually, if the angle increases as the car approaches, that makes sense. Because when you're farther away, the angle is smaller. So yes, moving closer increases the angle.\n\nSo, for the first scenario (angle 45\u00b0), tan(45) = h / d1. I know that tan(45) is 1, so h = d1. That's because tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent, so here opposite is h, adjacent is d1.\n\nFor the second scenario (angle 60\u00b0), tan(60) = h / d2. Tan(60) is sqrt(3), so sqrt(3) = h / d2. That means h = d2 * sqrt(3).\n\nSince h is the same in both cases, I can set them equal: d1 = d2 * sqrt(3). So d2 = d1 / sqrt(3).\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me think again. Because the car is moving towards the tower, when the angle increases from 45 to 60, the distance must have decreased. So the initial distance is d1, and then it becomes d2 = d1 - x, where x is the distance covered in those 10 minutes. But perhaps I should approach it differently.\n\nAlternatively, since the car is moving at a uniform speed, the time taken to cover the distance between d1 and d2 is 10 minutes. The time is proportional to the distance covered. So the distance between d1 and d2 is d1 - d2, and since speed is constant, the time taken is (d1 - d2)/speed.\n\nBut I don't know the speed, but maybe I can find the ratio.\n\nWait, let me write down the equations again.\n\nFrom the two angles:\n\nh = d1 * tan(45) = d1 * 1 => h = d1.\n\nh = d2 * tan(60) = d2 * sqrt(3) => h = d2 * sqrt(3).\n\nSo, d1 = d2 * sqrt(3) => d2 = d1 / sqrt(3).\n\nSo, the distance covered by the car during the 10 minutes is d1 - d2 = d1 - (d1/sqrt(3)) = d1 (1 - 1/sqrt(3)).\n\nWhich simplifies to d1 ( (sqrt(3) - 1)/sqrt(3) ) ).\n\nBut since the car is moving at uniform speed, the time taken is proportional to the distance. So 10 minutes = (d1 (sqrt(3) - 1)/sqrt(3)) ) / speed.\n\nWait, maybe I should let the speed be 'v'. So, the distance covered in 10 minutes is v * 10. But 10 minutes is 10/60 hours, but wait, maybe it's better to work in minutes as the time unit.\n\nWait, but the units might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps we can find the ratio of distances and times.\n\nLet me denote:\n\ndistance covered in 10 minutes: d1 - d2 = d1 (1 - 1/sqrt(3)).\n\nBut d1 is h. So, d1 = h. So, the distance covered is h (1 - 1/sqrt(3)).\n\nBut the speed v is (h (1 - 1/sqrt(3)) ) / 10.\n\nNow, the remaining distance after the angle became 60 degrees is d2. Which is h / sqrt(3). So the time to cover d2 at speed v is (d2) / v = (h / sqrt(3)) / [ (h (1 - 1/sqrt(3)) ) / 10 ].\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nTime = (h / sqrt(3)) * [10 / (h (1 - 1/sqrt(3)) ) ]\n\nThe h cancels out. So,\n\nTime = [10 / sqrt(3)] / [ (sqrt(3) - 1)/sqrt(3) ) ]\n\nWait, because (1 - 1/sqrt(3)) is equal to (sqrt(3) - 1)/sqrt(3). Let me check:\n\n1 = sqrt(3)/sqrt(3), so 1 - 1/sqrt(3) = (sqrt(3) - 1)/sqrt(3).\n\nSo the denominator is (sqrt(3) - 1)/sqrt(3).\n\nSo putting it together,\n\nTime = [10 / sqrt(3)] * [ sqrt(3) / (sqrt(3) - 1) ) ]\n\nThe sqrt(3) in numerator and denominator cancels.\n\nSo Time = 10 / (sqrt(3) - 1 )\n\nBut wait, 10 divided by (sqrt(3) -1) can be rationalized by multiplying numerator and denominator by (sqrt(3) +1):\n\nTime = 10 (sqrt(3)+1) / [ (sqrt(3)-1)(sqrt(3)+1) ) ]\n\nThe denominator becomes ( (sqrt(3))^2 - (1)^2 ) = 3 -1 = 2.\n\nSo Time = 10 (sqrt(3)+1) / 2 = 5 (sqrt(3) +1).\n\nSo that's 5 times (sqrt(3)+1), which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. So the time taken after the angle became 60 degrees is 5(sqrt(3)+1) minutes?\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think about the steps again.\n\nWait, the remaining distance is d2 = h / sqrt(3).\n\nThe speed v is (d1 -d2)/10, and d1 is h.\n\nSo, v = (h - h/sqrt(3)) /10 = h (1 - 1/sqrt(3)) /10.\n\nThen, the time to cover d2 is (d2)/v = (h/sqrt(3)) / [ h (1 - 1/sqrt(3)) /10 ].\n\nSo, the h's cancel.\n\n= [1/sqrt(3)] / [ (1 - 1/sqrt(3)) /10 ]\n\n= [1/sqrt(3)] * [10 / ( (sqrt(3)-1)/sqrt(3) ) ]\n\n= [1/sqrt(3)] * [10 * sqrt(3)/(sqrt(3)-1) ]\n\n= [1/sqrt(3) * sqrt(3)] * [10 / (sqrt(3)-1) ]\n\n= 1 * 10/(sqrt(3)-1)\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo after rationalization, 10 (sqrt(3)+1)/(2) )=5 (sqrt(3)+1).\n\nSo the time is 5 (sqrt(3)+1) minutes, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the options. The options are:\n\nA)5(\u221a3 + 1)\n\nYes, so option A is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the steps. Did I make any wrong assumptions?\n\nI think so. Because the car is moving towards the tower, the angle increases. So when the angle was 45 degrees, the distance was larger, and then it decreased to 60 degrees.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the angle changes from 45 to 60, meaning the car is moving towards the tower, so that's correct.\n\nAnother point: I assumed the speed is uniform, so the time taken is proportional to the distance.\n\nYes, because time = distance / speed, and speed is constant.\n\nSo, the approach seems correct.\n\nSo the answer is option A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about a car approaching a tower. Hmm, let me read the question again.\n\nThe car is moving straight at a uniform speed towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car, and it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45 degrees to 60 degrees. We need to find out how much more time it will take for the car to reach the base after these observations.\n\nWait, I think this is a trigonometry problem involving angles of elevation. So, when the car is at a certain distance from the tower, the angle to the top is 45 degrees, and then after some time, it becomes 60 degrees. The time taken for this change is 10 minutes, and we need the time remaining.\n\nI remember that when dealing with angles of elevation, we can model this with right triangles. Let me visualize this: the tower is vertical, so its height is fixed. The car is moving along the ground towards the base, so the distance from the car to the tower's base decreases over time.\n\nLet me denote the height of the tower as 'h'. When the angle is 45 degrees, the distance from the car to the tower's base is, let's say, 'd1'. When the angle becomes 60 degrees, the distance is 'd2'. Since the car is moving towards the tower, d2 is less than d1.\n\nWait, wait, actually, if the angle increases as the car approaches, that makes sense. Because when you're farther away, the angle is smaller. So yes, moving closer increases the angle.\n\nSo, for the first scenario (angle 45\u00b0), tan(45) = h / d1. I know that tan(45) is 1, so h = d1. That's because tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent, so here opposite is h, adjacent is d1.\n\nFor the second scenario (angle 60\u00b0), tan(60) = h / d2. Tan(60) is sqrt(3), so sqrt(3) = h / d2. That means h = d2 * sqrt(3).\n\nSince h is the same in both cases, I can set them equal: d1 = d2 * sqrt(3). So d2 = d1 / sqrt(3).\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me think again. Because the car is moving towards the tower, when the angle increases from 45 to 60, the distance must have decreased. So the initial distance is d1, and then it becomes d2 = d1 - x, where x is the distance covered in those 10 minutes. But perhaps I should approach it differently.\n\nAlternatively, since the car is moving at a uniform speed, the time taken to cover the distance between d1 and d2 is 10 minutes. The time is proportional to the distance covered. So the distance between d1 and d2 is d1 - d2, and since speed is constant, the time taken is (d1 - d2)/speed.\n\nBut I don't know the speed, but maybe I can find the ratio.\n\nWait, let me write down the equations again.\n\nFrom the two angles:\n\nh = d1 * tan(45) = d1 * 1 => h = d1.\n\nh = d2 * tan(60) = d2 * sqrt(3) => h = d2 * sqrt(3).\n\nSo, d1 = d2 * sqrt(3) => d2 = d1 / sqrt(3).\n\nSo, the distance covered by the car during the 10 minutes is d1 - d2 = d1 - (d1/sqrt(3)) = d1 (1 - 1/sqrt(3)).\n\nWhich simplifies to d1 ( (sqrt(3) - 1)/sqrt(3) ) ).\n\nBut since the car is moving at uniform speed, the time taken is proportional to the distance. So 10 minutes = (d1 (sqrt(3) - 1)/sqrt(3)) ) / speed.\n\nWait, maybe I should let the speed be 'v'. So, the distance covered in 10 minutes is v * 10. But 10 minutes is 10/60 hours, but wait, maybe it's better to work in minutes as the time unit.\n\nWait, but the units might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps we can find the ratio of distances and times.\n\nLet me denote:\n\ndistance covered in 10 minutes: d1 - d2 = d1 (1 - 1/sqrt(3)).\n\nBut d1 is h. So, d1 = h. So, the distance covered is h (1 - 1/sqrt(3)).\n\nBut the speed v is (h (1 - 1/sqrt(3)) ) / 10.\n\nNow, the remaining distance after the angle became 60 degrees is d2. Which is h / sqrt(3). So the time to cover d2 at speed v is (d2) / v = (h / sqrt(3)) / [ (h (1 - 1/sqrt(3)) ) / 10 ].\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nTime = (h / sqrt(3)) * [10 / (h (1 - 1/sqrt(3)) ) ]\n\nThe h cancels out. So,\n\nTime = [10 / sqrt(3)] / [ (sqrt(3) - 1)/sqrt(3) ) ]\n\nWait, because (1 - 1/sqrt(3)) is equal to (sqrt(3) - 1)/sqrt(3). Let me check:\n\n1 = sqrt(3)/sqrt(3), so 1 - 1/sqrt(3) = (sqrt(3) - 1)/sqrt(3).\n\nSo the denominator is (sqrt(3) - 1)/sqrt(3).\n\nSo putting it together,\n\nTime = [10 / sqrt(3)] * [ sqrt(3) / (sqrt(3) - 1) ) ]\n\nThe sqrt(3) in numerator and denominator cancels.\n\nSo Time = 10 / (sqrt(3) - 1 )\n\nBut wait, 10 divided by (sqrt(3) -1) can be rationalized by multiplying numerator and denominator by (sqrt(3) +1):\n\nTime = 10 (sqrt(3)+1) / [ (sqrt(3)-1)(sqrt(3)+1) ) ]\n\nThe denominator becomes ( (sqrt(3))^2 - (1)^2 ) = 3 -1 = 2.\n\nSo Time = 10 (sqrt(3)+1) / 2 = 5 (sqrt(3) +1).\n\nSo that's 5 times (sqrt(3)+1), which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. So the time taken after the angle became 60 degrees is 5(sqrt(3)+1) minutes?\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think about the steps again.\n\nWait, the remaining distance is d2 = h / sqrt(3).\n\nThe speed v is (d1 -d2)/10, and d1 is h.\n\nSo, v = (h - h/sqrt(3)) /10 = h (1 - 1/sqrt(3)) /10.\n\nThen, the time to cover d2 is (d2)/v = (h/sqrt(3)) / [ h (1 - 1/sqrt(3)) /10 ].\n\nSo, the h's cancel.\n\n= [1/sqrt(3)] / [ (1 - 1/sqrt(3)) /10 ]\n\n= [1/sqrt(3)] * [10 / ( (sqrt(3)-1)/sqrt(3) ) ]\n\n= [1/sqrt(3)] * [10 * sqrt(3)/(sqrt(3)-1) ]\n\n= [1/sqrt(3) * sqrt(3)] * [10 / (sqrt(3)-1) ]\n\n= 1 * 10/(sqrt(3)-1)\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo after rationalization, 10 (sqrt(3)+1)/(2) )=5 (sqrt(3)+1).\n\nSo the time is 5 (sqrt(3)+1) minutes, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the options. The options are:\n\nA)5(\u221a3 + 1)\n\nYes, so option A is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the steps. Did I make any wrong assumptions?\n\nI think so. Because the car is moving towards the tower, the angle increases. So when the angle was 45 degrees, the distance was larger, and then it decreased to 60 degrees.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the angle changes from 45 to 60, meaning the car is moving towards the tower, so that's correct.\n\nAnother point: I assumed the speed is uniform, so the time taken is proportional to the distance.\n\nYes, because time = distance / speed, and speed is constant.\n\nSo, the approach seems correct.\n\nSo the answer is option A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the situation using trigonometry. The car is moving towards the base of a vertical tower at a uniform speed, and the angle of elevation to the top of the tower changes from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 in 10 minutes.

The car is moving straight towards the base of a vertical tower at a uniform speed. At some point, the driver looks up and the angle of elevation to the top of the tower is 45 degrees. Then, after 10 minutes, the angle changes to 60 degrees. The question is asking how much more time the car will take to reach the base after that 10 minutes.\n\nWait, so the car is moving at a constant speed, which is good because that means I can use some uniform motion equations. I'm a bit rusty on trigonometry, but I think I can handle this with right triangles.\n\nLet me sketch this out. There's a vertical tower, so the height is fixed. The car is moving along the ground towards the tower. At two different points, the angle of elevation is 45 degrees and then 60 degrees. So I can model this with two right triangles with the same height (the tower) but different base lengths.\n\nLet me denote the height of the tower as h. At the first point, when the angle is 45 degrees, the distance from the car to the base of the tower is, let's say, d1. So using trigonometry, tan(45) = h / d1. Since tan(45) is 1, h = d1. So the tower's height is equal to d1.\n\nThen, after 10 minutes, the angle changes to 60 degrees. Let's call the new distance d2. So tan(60) = h / d2. Tan(60) is sqrt(3), so h = d2 * sqrt(3). But earlier, we said h = d1, so d1 = d2 * sqrt(3). Which means d2 = d1 / sqrt(3).\n\nWait, but the car is moving towards the tower, so d2 must be less than d1. Oh, right, because as the car moves closer, the angle increases. So yes, d2 is smaller than d1. So the distance the car covered in those 10 minutes is d1 - d2.\n\nSo the distance covered in 10 minutes is d1 - (d1 / sqrt(3)) = d1 (1 - 1/sqrt(3)).\n\nSince the car is moving at a uniform speed, let's find the speed. Speed v = (distance) / (time). The time here is 10 minutes, but I should convert that to hours if I'm using standard units, but wait, maybe it's easier to keep it in minutes for now.\n\nSo v = [d1 (1 - 1/sqrt(3))] / 10.\n\nBut I'm supposed to find the time taken after that 10 minutes to reach the base. So after the second observation (when the angle is 60 degrees), the car is at distance d2 from the tower. So the remaining distance to cover is d2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, wait. Let me clarify. At the first observation, the distance is d1. Then, after moving towards the tower for 10 minutes, the distance becomes d2. So the remaining distance after that point is d2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when the angle is 60 degrees, the car is at distance d2, and the base is d2 away. So to reach the base from that point, the car has to cover d2. Since the speed is v, time is distance over speed. So time = d2 / v.\n\nBut I already have expressions for d2 and v. Let's plug them in.\n\nWe have d2 = d1 / sqrt(3), and v = [d1 (1 - 1/sqrt(3))] / 10.\n\nSo time = (d1 / sqrt(3)) / [ (d1 (1 - 1/sqrt(3)) ) / 10 ]\n\nSimplify this. The d1 terms cancel out.\n\nTime = [ (1 / sqrt(3)) ] / [ (1 - 1/sqrt(3)) / 10 ]\n\nWhich is [ (1 / sqrt(3)) * 10 ] / (1 - 1/sqrt(3)) )\n\nLet me compute the denominator: 1 - 1/sqrt(3) = (sqrt(3) - 1)/sqrt(3).\n\nSo substituting:\n\nTime = [ 10 / sqrt(3) ] / [ (sqrt(3) -1)/sqrt(3) ) ] \n\nThe sqrt(3) in numerator and denominator cancels out.\n\nSo Time = 10 / (sqrt(3) -1 )\n\nHmm, that's an expression, but it's not in the options. Wait, let's rationalize the denominator.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (sqrt(3) +1):\n\nTime = 10 (sqrt(3) +1 ) / [ (sqrt(3) -1)(sqrt(3)+1) ]\n\nThe denominator becomes (3 -1) = 2.\n\nSo Time = [10 (sqrt(3)+1)] / 2 = 5 (sqrt(3) +1 )\n\nWait, that's option A. So the answer should be option A.\n\nWait a second, but let me double-check my steps. Because sometimes I might have mixed up the distances.\n\nWait, the initial distance is d1 when angle is 45. Then, after 10 minutes, it's d2 when angle is 60. The car's speed is constant, so the distance covered in 10 minutes is d1 - d2.\n\nWhich is d1 - (d1 / sqrt(3)) = d1 (1 - 1/sqrt(3)).\n\nSo the speed v = (d1 (1 -1/sqrt(3)) ) / 10.\n\nThen, the remaining distance is d2, which is d1 / sqrt(3).\n\nTime to cover that is (d2) / v = [d1 / sqrt(3)] / [ (d1 (1 -1/sqrt(3)) ) / 10 ]\n\nWhich simplifies as before to 5 (sqrt(3)+1). So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer is option A, 5(\u221a3 + 1) minutes.\n",

At the first observation, the distance is d1. Then, after moving towards the tower for 10 minutes, the distance becomes d2. So the remaining distance after that point is d2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when the angle is 60 degrees, the car is at distance d2, and the base is d2 away. So to reach the base from that point, the car has to cover d2. Since the speed is v, time is distance over speed. So time = d2 / v.\n\nBut I already have expressions for d2 and v. Let's plug them in.\n\nWe have d2 = d1 / sqrt(3), and v = [d1 (1 - 1/sqrt(3))] / 10.\n\nSo time = (d1 / sqrt(3)) / [ (d1 (1 - 1/sqrt(3)) ) / 10 ]\n\nSimplify this. The d1 terms cancel out.\n\nTime = [ (1 / sqrt(3)) ] / [ (1 - 1/sqrt(3)) / 10 ]\n\nWhich is [ (1 / sqrt(3)) * 10 ] / (1 - 1/sqrt(3)) )\n\nLet me compute the denominator: 1 - 1/sqrt(3) = (sqrt(3) - 1)/sqrt(3).\n\nSo substituting:\n\nTime = [ 10 / sqrt(3) ] / [ (sqrt(3) -1)/sqrt(3) ) ] \n\nThe sqrt(3) in numerator and denominator cancels out.\n\nSo Time = 10 / (sqrt(3) -1 )\n\nHmm, that's an expression, but it's not in the options. Wait, let's rationalize the denominator.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (sqrt(3) +1):\n\nTime = 10 (sqrt(3) +1 ) / [ (sqrt(3) -1)(sqrt(3)+1) ]\n\nThe denominator becomes (3 -1) = 2.\n\nSo Time = [10 (sqrt(3)+1)] / 2 = 5 (sqrt(3) +1 )\n\nWait, that's option A. So the answer should be option A.\n\nWait a second, but let me double-check my steps. Because sometimes I might have mixed up the distances.\n\nWait, the initial distance is d1 when angle is 45. Then, after 10 minutes, it's d2 when angle is 60. The car's speed is constant, so the distance covered in 10 minutes is d1 - d2.\n\nWhich is d1 - (d1 / sqrt(3)) = d1 (1 - 1/sqrt(3)).\n\nSo the speed v = (d1 (1 -1/sqrt(3)) ) / 10.\n\nThen, the remaining distance is d2, which is d1 / sqrt(3).\n\nTime to cover that is (d2) / v = [d1 / sqrt(3)] / [ (d1 (1 -1/sqrt(3)) ) / 10 ]\n\nWhich simplifies as before to 5 (sqrt(3)+1). So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer is option A, 5(\u221a3 + 1) minutes.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the situation using trigonometry and uniform motion principles. The car is moving towards the base of a vertical tower at a constant speed, and the angle of elevation to the top of the tower changes from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 over 10 minutes. We aim to determine how much more time the car will take to reach the base after the angle changes to 60\u00b0.\n\n### Step 1: Define the distances\nLet the height of the tower be \\( h \\). At the first observation (45\u00b0), the distance from the car to the base of the tower is \\( d_1 \\). Using trigonometry:\n\\[\n\\tan(45^\\circ) = \\frac{h}{d_1} \\implies h = d_1\n\\]\n\nAt the second observation (60\u00b0), the distance from the car to the base of the tower is \\( d_2 \\). Using trigonometry:\n\\[\n\\tan(60^\\circ) = \\frac{h}{d_2} \\implies h = d_2 \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( h = d_1 \\), we substitute:\n\\[\nd_1 = d_2 \\sqrt{3} \\implies d_2 = \\frac{d_1}{\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Distance traveled in 10 minutes\nThe car travels from \\( d_1 \\) to \\( d_2 \\) in 10 minutes. The distance covered is:\n\\[\nd_1 - d_2 = d_1 - \\frac{d_1}{\\sqrt{3}} = d_1 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThe speed \\( v \\) of the car is:\n\\[\nv = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}} = \\frac{d_1 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)}{10}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Remaining distance and time to base\nAfter the second observation, the car is at a distance \\( d_2 \\) from the base. The remaining distance to the base is \\( d_2 = \\frac{d_1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\). The time \\( t \\) to cover this distance at speed \\( v \\) is:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} = \\frac{\\frac{d_1}{\\sqrt{3}}}{\\frac{d_1 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)}{10}}\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}}{1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}} \\cdot 10\n\\]\n\nRationalize the denominator:\n\\[\n1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} - 1}{\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3} - 1}{\\sqrt{3}}} \\cdot 10 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3} - 1} \\cdot 10 = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3} - 1}\n\\]\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \\( \\sqrt{3} + 1 \\) to rationalize:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{10 (\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\\sqrt{3} - 1)(\\sqrt{3} + 1)} = \\frac{10 (\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1} = \\frac{10 (\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{2} = 5 (\\sqrt{3} + 1)\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe car will take \\( 5 (\\sqrt{3} + 1) \\) minutes to reach the base after the angle changes to 60\u00b0. This corresponds to **Option A**.\n\nAnswer: A",
