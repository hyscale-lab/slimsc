      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where Shweta is riding her bike, right? She goes at a speed of 10 km per hour. But every time she covers 15 km, she takes a 10-minute break. The question is asking how long it will take her to cover 100 km. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, let's think about her riding without any breaks. If she goes 10 km/h, then the time taken without stops would be total distance divided by speed. So 100 km divided by 10 km/h equals 10 hours. But wait, she takes breaks every 15 km. So she doesn't ride continuously for 100 km; she stops after every 15 km. So I need to calculate how many breaks she takes and add that to the total time.\n\nLet me break it down. Each segment she rides is 15 km. How many such segments are in 100 km? Well, 15 times 6 is 90, and 15*7 is 105. So 100 km would be six full segments of 15 km each, which is 90 km, and then a remaining 10 km. Wait, no. Wait, 15 km each time. So let me think again.\n\nWait, 100 divided by 15. Let's calculate that. 15*6 is 90, 15*7 is 105. So 100 is 6 full 15-km segments and 10 km left. So she would have 6 segments where she rides 15 km, and then one last segment of 10 km. But does she take a break after each 15 km, including the last one? Let me see the problem statement. It says she stops after every 15 km. So after the 15th km, she stops. So if she completes a 15 km ride, she takes a break. But for the last segment, which is 10 km, she doesn't reach 15, so no break after that.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. Let's say she starts, rides 15 km, takes a break. Then another 15, break, and so on. So for 100 km, how many 15-km segments does she complete? Let me see. 15*6=90, so 6 segments of 15 km, then 10 km more. So she would have taken a break after each of the 6 segments, right? Because each time she completes 15 km, she stops. So that's 6 breaks.\n\nEach break is 10 minutes. So total break time is 6 * 10 = 60 minutes, which is 1 hour.\n\nNow, calculate the time she spends riding. Each 15 km takes her 15/10 = 1.5 hours. So 6 segments would take 6 * 1.5 = 9 hours. Plus the last 10 km. How long does that take? 10 km at 10 km/h is 1 hour. So total riding time is 9 + 1 = 10 hours. Then add the break time of 1 hour. So total time is 11 hours.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. So after each 15 km, she stops. So for each 15 km, she rides for 1.5 hours, then stops for 10 minutes. So for 6 segments, that's 6 stops. So 6*1.5 hours = 9 hours, and 6*10 minutes = 60 minutes. Then she does the last 10 km in 1 hour. So total is 9 + 1 = 10 riding, plus 1 hour break = 11 hours. So the answer should be 11 hours.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 11 hours. So the correct answer is C.\n",

So, the question says Shweta rides at 10 km per hour, but she stops for 10 minutes after every 15 km. I need to find out how long it will take her to cover 100 km. The options are from A to E, so I'll need to calculate and pick the right one.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. First, her speed is 10 km/h. That means she covers 10 km every hour. But she doesn't ride continuously; she takes a break every 15 km. So every time she covers 15 km, she stops for 10 minutes. I need to calculate the time she spends riding and the time she stops, then add them together for the total time.\n\nWait, but how many times does she stop? Hmm. Let me think. If she's going 100 km, and she stops after every 15 km, how many stops does that mean?\n\nWait, maybe I should first figure out how many 15 km segments are there in 100 km. Let's see, 100 divided by 15 is... 6.666... So that's 6 full 15 km segments, and then a remaining part.\n\nWait, but does she stop after each 15 km? So after the first 15 km, she stops. After the next 15, she stops again, and so on. So for 6 segments, she would have 6 stops. But wait, does she stop after the last segment? Because if the last segment is the 100th km, she might not need to stop again. So let's think carefully.\n\nWait, the total distance is 100 km. Let me see: she rides 15 km, stops; another 15, stops; another 15, stops, etc. So for each 15 km except the last part, she stops. Wait, but 15 times 6 is 90. So she has 6 segments of 15 km each, which is 90 km. Then she has 10 km left to reach 100 km. So in that last 10 km, does she stop? No, because she only stops after every 15 km. So she only stops 6 times during the trip.\n\nWait, wait, let me confirm. Let's say she does 15 km, stops. Then another 15, stops again. So after each 15, she stops. So for 100 km, she has 6 stops, right? Because after the 6th 15 km, she's at 90 km, then she rides the remaining 10 km without stopping. So that's correct.\n\nSo each 15 km segment takes how long? Since her speed is 10 km/h, time is distance divided by speed. So 15 km / 10 km/h = 1.5 hours per segment. So each 15 km takes 1.5 hours, and she does this 6 times. So the riding time is 6 * 1.5 hours. Let me calculate that: 6 * 1.5 is 9 hours.\n\nNow, the stops. She stops 6 times, each for 10 minutes. 10 minutes is 1/6 of an hour, approximately 0.1667 hours. So 6 * 0.1667 is about 1 hour. So total time is riding time plus stop time: 9 + 1 = 10 hours.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes the stops might add up differently. So 6 stops of 10 minutes each is 60 minutes, which is exactly 1 hour. So 9 hours riding plus 1 hour stops equals 10 hours total.\n\nBut wait, what about the last part after the 6th stop? She rides the remaining 10 km. So how long does that take? 10 km at 10 km/h is 1 hour. So adding that to the previous calculation: riding time is 6*1.5 (for the 90 km) plus 1 hour (for the last 10 km), so 9 + 1 = 10 hours riding, and 6 stops of 10 mins each is 1 hour. So total 11 hours? Wait, wait, I think I messed up.\n\nHold on. Let me re-examine. The initial approach was that for each 15 km, she rides 1.5 hours, then stops 10 minutes. So for the first 6 segments (90 km), she rides 6*1.5=9 hours, and stops 6 times, 6*0.1667\u22481 hour. Then she has 10 km left. That 10 km takes 1 hour. So total riding time is 9 +1=10 hours, and stops are 1 hour. So total time is 10 +1=11 hours? Hmm, that would make the answer C)11 hours.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier it was 10. Where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the number of stops. Let me recount. She completes 15 km, stops; 15 km, stops; 15 km, stops; 15 km, stops; 15 km, stops; 15 km, stops. That's 6 stops after each 15 km. But the last segment is 10 km, so she doesn't stop after that. So yes, 6 stops.\n\nSo the time for the 90 km is 6*1.5 =9 hours, and 6*0.1667=1 hour. Then the last 10 km takes 1 hour. So total time is 9 +1 +1=11 hours.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 90+10=100 km. So riding time is 10 hours, stops are 1 hour. So total 11 hours.\n\nBut wait, another way to think: total distance is 100 km. She rides 15 km, then stops, and so on. Let's compute the number of stops.\n\nHow many times does she stop? The number of stops is equal to the number of times she completes a 15 km segment. So for 100 km, how many 15 km segments can she do? Let me see:\n\nNumber of 15 km segments: 100 /15 =6.666... So she completes 6 full 15 km segments, each followed by a stop, and then a final segment of 10 km without a stop. So yes, 6 stops.\n\nSo time for each 15 km segment: 15/10 =1.5 hours. 6 segments: 6 *1.5=9 hours.\n\nStops: 6 stops *10 minutes =60 minutes=1 hour.\n\nTime for the last 10 km: 10/10=1 hour.\n\nSo total time is 9 (riding for 90 km) +1 (stops) +1 (riding last 10 km)=11 hours.\n\nSo the answer should be C)11 hours.\n\nWait, but let's check another approach. Let's calculate the total time.\n\nTotal riding time: 100 km at 10 km/h is 10 hours. But she stops for 10 minutes after every 15 km. So how many stops? 6 stops as before. So 6 *10 minutes=60 minutes=1 hour. So total time is 10 +1=11 hours.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the answer is 11 hours, option C.\n",

So first, let's figure out how long she rides before each stop. She rides 15 km at 10 km/h. Time is distance divided by speed, right? So 15 km / 10 km/h = 1.5 hours. So she rides for 1.5 hours, then stops for 10 minutes.\n\nWait, but how many times does she stop? Because after every 15 km, she stops. But does she stop after the last 15 km if she's already reached 100 km? That's something to think about.\n\nLet me calculate how many 15 km segments are there in 100 km. So 100 divided by 15 is approximately 6.666. That means she completes 6 full 15 km segments, and then a partial segment. Wait, but 6 times 15 is 90 km. So the remaining is 10 km. So she'll have 6 stops, right? Because after each 15 km, she stops. So the 6th stop comes after 90 km, then she rides another 10 km, which doesn't require a stop.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let's think again. So she starts riding, covers 15 km, stops. Then another 15, stops. So for 100 km, how many 15 km blocks are there before she gets to 100?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of each segment she rides, then the rest.\n\nSo she needs to cover 100 km. Each time she rides 15 km, she takes a 10-minute break. So for every 15 km, she spends 1.5 hours riding plus 10 minutes resting. But wait, the last segment may be less than 15 km, so no rest after that.\n\nSo let's break it down. First, calculate how many full 15 km segments she does. 100 divided by 15 is 6 with a remainder of 10. So 6 full segments, each 15 km, and then a final 10 km.\n\nEach full segment: riding 15 km takes 1.5 hours, then a 10-minute break. So each segment takes 1.5 + 0.1667 hours (since 10 minutes is 1/6 of an hour, which is approximately 0.1667). Wait, no, 10 minutes is 1/6 of an hour, which is 0.166666... So for each 15 km, it's 1.5 hours riding plus 0.1667 hours resting.\n\nSo for 6 segments: 6*(1.5 + 0.1667) hours.\n\nLet me compute that. 6 * 1.5 is 9. 6 * 0.1667 is about 1. So 9 + 1 = 10 hours for the 6 segments. But wait, that's only for the 6 segments, which take her to 90 km. Then she has 10 km left.\n\nNow, the last 10 km: she doesn't stop after that, right? Because she's reached the destination. So she rides 10 km at 10 km/h, which takes 1 hour.\n\nSo the total time is the time for the 6 segments plus the last 10 km.\n\nWait, but wait again. The 6 segments are each 15 km, so 6 *15=90, plus 10 is 100.\n\nSo time for the 6 segments: each is 1.5 hours riding + 10 min rest. But wait, when she starts, she rides 15 km, stops, then rides another 15, stops, etc. So after the 6th 15 km, she's at 90, and then she rides 10 km to reach 100, without stopping.\n\nSo the number of stops she makes is 6? Because she stops after each 15 km, but after the last 15 km (the 6th), she stops again before the last 10 km.\n\nWait, no. Because she stops after every 15 km. So after 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 km. So that's six stops. But wait, when she reaches 90, she stops for 10 minutes, then rides another 10 km to 100. So she stops 6 times.\n\nSo the total time is:\n\nTime riding: (6 segments * 15 km) + 10 km.\n\nWait, no. The riding time is for each segment plus the last 10 km. So each 15 km takes 1.5 hours. So 6*1.5 = 9 hours. The last 10 km takes 1 hour. So total riding time is 9 + 1 = 10 hours.\n\nThe rest time: 6 stops, each 10 minutes. 6 * 10 = 60 minutes = 1 hour.\n\nSo total time is 10 (riding) + 1 (rest) = 11 hours. So the answer should be C) 11 hours.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me calculate it step by step.\n\nEach 15 km takes 1.5 hours of riding and 10 minutes of rest.\n\nFor 6 such segments:\n\nRiding: 6 * 1.5 =9 hours.\n\nRest: 6 * 0.1667 \u22481 hour.\n\nThen, the last 10 km: 1 hour.\n\nSo total time is 9 + 1 +1 = 11 hours. So yes, option C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of total distance, but that's more complicated because of the rest periods.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's calculate how much time she spends riding and resting for each 15 km, then see how many of these she completes before the last stretch.\n\nSo for each 15 km: 1.5 hours ride + 0.1667 hours rest = 1.6667 hours per 15 km.\n\nWait, but if she does 6 of these, that's 6 * 15 =90 km. Then, she has 10 km left.\n\nBut wait, the time for 6 segments would be 6 *1.6667 = 10 hours. Then, the last 10 km takes 1 hour, so total 11 hours. Same result.\n\nAlternatively, what if she doesn't stop after the last 15 km? No, she does. Because she stops after every 15 km, regardless. So after 90 km (6th 15 km), she stops, then rides the last 10 km without stopping.\n\nSo the 6 stops are included.\n\nAnother way to think: total distance is 100 km.\n\nNumber of 15 km segments before 100 km is 6 (each 15 km) with a remainder of 10 km.\n\nSo she rides 15 km six times, each taking 1.5 hours, and rests 10 minutes each time. Then rides 10 km once.\n\nSo total riding time: 6 *1.5 + 1 = 9 +1=10.\n\nTotal rest time: 6 *10 min=60 min=1 hour.\n\nTotal time: 10 +1=11.\n\nSo the answer is C) 11 hours.\n",

And the question is, how long will it take her to cover 100 km? The options are from A to E, with various hours given.\n\nHmm, alright, let's break this down. First, I need to figure out how much time she spends riding and how much time she spends resting. Because every time she covers 15 km, she takes a 10-minute break. But wait, does she take a break after the last 15 km as well? Or does she stop only until she reaches 100 km?\n\nWait, the question says she stops after every 15 km. So if she's going 100 km, I need to see how many 15 km segments are there and whether she takes a rest after the last one or not. Because if she stops after every 15, then the last stop might be after 15 km, but if the total isn't a multiple of 15, she might not need to stop again.\n\nWait, 100 divided by 15 is about 6.666, so that's 6 full 15 km segments, but wait, 6*15 is 90, so the 7th segment would be 10 km. Hmm, so she might have 6 stops, but wait, let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate how many times she stops. Let's see. Each time she rides 15 km, she stops. So for 100 km, how many 15 km intervals are there? Let me compute 100 / 15. That's 6 with a remainder of 10. So she completes 6 full 15 km rides, then a 10 km ride. Now, does she stop after the 15 km each time, including the 6th, and then not stop after the last 10 km? Because she's already at 90 km after 6 stops. So after each 15 km, she stops. So after the first 15, stop. Then another 15, stop, and so on. So after the 6th 15 km (which is 90 km), she stops again. Then she rides the remaining 10 km without stopping because she's reached her destination.\n\nWait, no, because she stops after each 15 km. So after 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 km. So that's 6 stops. Each stop is 10 minutes. So 6 stops would be 60 minutes, which is 1 hour.\n\nNow, the riding time. Each 15 km takes her how long? Since she rides at 10 km/h, time is distance divided by speed. So 15 km at 10 km/h is 15/10 = 1.5 hours. So for each 15 km segment, 1.5 hours of riding. So 6 segments would be 6 * 1.5 = 9 hours. Then the last 10 km. That would take 10/10 = 1 hour.\n\nSo total riding time is 9 + 1 = 10 hours. Then add the rest time: 6 stops * 10 minutes = 60 minutes, which is 1 hour. So total time is 10 + 1 = 11 hours.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. 6 segments of 15 km each: 6*15=90 km. Then 10 km left. So she rides 90 km in 6*1.5 =9 hours, plus 1 hour for the last 10 km: 10 hours riding. Then 6 stops, each 10 minutes: 6*0.1667 hours (since 10 minutes is 1/6 hour) \u2192 6*(1/6) = 1 hour.

Now, does she stop after the 15 km each time, including the 6th, and then not stop after the last 10 km? Because she's already at 90 km after 6 stops. So after each 15 km, she stops. So after the first 15, stop. Then another 15, stop, and so on. So after the 6th 15 km (which is 90 km), she stops again.

Each stop is 10 minutes. So 6 stops would be 60 minutes, which is 1 hour.\n\nNow, the riding time. Each 15 km takes her how long? Since she rides at 10 km/h, time is distance divided by speed. So 15 km at 10 km/h is 15/10 = 1.5 hours. So for each 15 km segment, 1.5 hours of riding. So 6 segments would be 6 * 1.5 = 9 hours. Then the last 10 km.

Since she completes 6 segments of 15 km, she takes 6 breaks. Each break is 10 minutes, which is \\(\\frac{10}{60} = \\frac{1}{6}\\) hours.  \n   Total resting time is:  \n   \\[\n   6 \\times \\frac{1}{6} = 1 \\, \\text{hour}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total time**:  \n   Adding the riding and resting times:  \n   \\[\n   10 + 1 = 11 \\, \\text{hours}.\n   \\]\n\nThus, Shweta will take **11 hours** to cover 100 km.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so Shweta is riding her... I guess a bike or a vehicle, but the specifics don't matter. The question is about how long she takes to cover 100 km, considering she takes breaks. Let me break it down.\n\nSo her speed is 10 km per hour. Without any stops, the time she would take is distance divided by speed. But she stops every 15 km for 10 minutes. Hmm, so I need to figure out how many times she stops and then add the break time to the riding time.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total distance, which is 100 km. Each time she rides 15 km, she stops. Wait, but does she stop after completing 15 km, meaning that the 15th km is the last one before the break? So, for every 15 km, she takes a 10-minute break. But wait, do we need to account for the last part? Like, after the last 15 km, does she need to stop again? Let's think about it.\n\nSo she starts riding, goes 15 km, takes a break. Then another 15 km, another break, and so on. So for 100 km, how many 15 km segments are there?\n\n100 divided by 15 is approximately 6.666. But she can't ride a fraction of a segment. So she completes 6 full 15 km segments, which is 90 km. Then she has 10 km left. So she doesn't need to stop after the 10 km because the 15 km segment isn't completed. So she only stops after each 15 km, except maybe the last one if it's not a full segment.\n\nWait, no. Wait, she stops after every 15 km. So after 15 km, she stops. Then after 30 km, another stop, and so on. So for 100 km, how many times does she stop?\n\nLet's see: After 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 km\u2014those are six stops. Because after 15 km, she stops. Then after the next 15, another stop. So for 100 km, she completes 6 segments of 15 km each (which is 90 km) and then the last 10 km. So she stops after each 15, so after 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90. That's 6 stops. So each stop is 10 minutes.\n\nNow, the riding time. Each 15 km takes her 15/10 hours. 15 divided by 10 is 1.5 hours. So for each segment, 1.5 hours of riding. She has 6 segments of 15 km, which is 6 * 1.5 = 9 hours. Plus, the last 10 km. How long does that take? 10 km at 10 km/h is 1 hour. So total riding time is 9 + 1 = 10 hours.\n\nThen the breaks: 6 stops, each 10 minutes. 6 * 10 minutes is 60 minutes, which is 1 hour. So total time is riding time plus break time: 10 + 1 = 11 hours.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. The 100 km is covered in 7 segments? No, wait, 15*6 is 90, plus 10 makes 100. So 6 segments of 15, and then a 10 km. So 6 stops. Because each stop comes after a 15 km segment. So 6 stops of 10 minutes each.\n\nSo riding time is 6*1.5 + 1.0 = 10 hours. Breaks are 6*0.166666... hours (since 10 minutes is 1/6 of an hour). So 6 * (1/6) = 1 hour. So total 11 hours.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 11 hours.\n",

Hmm, the question says she rides at 10 km per hour but stops for 10 minutes every 15 km. I need to find out how long it takes her to cover 100 km. \n\nWait, right, so she's going 10 km/h. Without any stops, how long would it take her? Well, time is distance over speed. So 100 km divided by 10 km/h is 10 hours. But wait, she's stopping every 15 km, so she'll have breaks in between. I need to account for those.\n\nLet me think about how many times she stops. Every 15 km, right? So for 100 km, how many 15 km segments are there? Let me see, 15 times 6 is 90, and 15 times 7 is 105. Oh wait, she doesn't need to go beyond 100. So she completes 6 full 15 km segments, which gets her to 90 km. Then she has 10 km left. \n\nWait, but does she stop after every 15 km. So after each 15 km, she takes a 10-minute break. So for 6 segments, she'll have 6 stops? Because after the first 15 km, she stops once. So for 6 segments, 6 stops? Wait, no. Wait, let's think: when she starts, she rides 15 km, then stops. Then another 15, then stops, and so on. So after each 15 km except the last one, she stops. Because once she's done the last part, she doesn't need to stop again.\n\nWait, wait. So the total distance is 100 km. Let's break it down into 15 km chunks. 15 * 6 is 90, then 10 km left. So she does 6 stops before the last part. Because after each 15 km, she stops, except the last 10 km. So 6 stops.\n\nEach stop is 10 minutes. So 6 stops would be 6 * 10 minutes = 60 minutes, which is 1 hour.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. So she rides 15 km, stops for 10 min. Then another 15, stops again. Repeat this 6 times. So she has 6 stops. So 6 *10 min=60 min, which is 1 hour. Then she rides the remaining 10 km. \n\nSo the riding time would be the time for each segment. Each 15 km takes 15/10 = 1.5 hours. So 6 segments would be 6 * 1.5 hours = 9 hours. Plus the last 10 km: 10/10 =1 hour. So total riding time is 9 +1 = 10 hours. Then add the stop time of 1 hour. So total time is 11 hours.\n\nWait, that's option C. Hmm. Let me check again. So she does 15 km segments 6 times (90 km), each taking 1.5 hours. So 6 *1.5=9 hours. Then she has 10 km left, which takes 1 hour. So riding is 10 hours. Plus 6 stops, each 10 min: 60 minutes=1 hour. So total time 10 +1=11 hours.\n\nWait, but is the last segment (10 km) requiring a stop? Because she stops after every 15 km. So she's only stopping after completing 15 km. So when she does the last 10 km, she doesn't stop after that. So the stops are only after the 15 km segments. So for 100 km, she has 6 stops.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate how many 15 km segments are in 100 km, and then the number of stops is (number of segments) -1? No, wait, no. Because she stops after each 15 km. So for each 15 km, a stop. So for 100 km, it's 6 full 15 km, and a 10 km. So she stops 6 times.\n\nWait, let me think about it another way. Let's say she starts, rides 15 km, stops. Then another 15, stops. So for each 15 km, she adds a stop. So for n 15 km segments, she has n stops. But wait, wait, the first 15 km is ride, then stop. So for 15 km, 1 stop. For 30 km, 2 stops. So for 90 km (6*15), 6 stops. Then the last 10 km, no stop. So total 6 stops. So 6 stops of 10 minutes each is 60 minutes, 1 hour.\n\nSo riding time is 90 km (6*15) which is 6*1.5=9 hours. Plus 10 km which takes 1 hour. So 10 hours of riding. Plus 1 hour of stops. Total 11 hours. So option C is 11 hours.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should model it step by step:\n\n1. First 15 km: time = 1.5 hours. Then 10 min stop. Time so far: 1.5 + 0.1667= ~1.6667 hours.\n\n2. Next 15 km: another 1.5 hours. Stop again. Time so far: 1.5 *2=3 hours riding, 2 stops= 20 min. So total time after two segments: 3 + 20/60= 3.3333 hours.\n\nWait, maybe this approach is getting too detailed. Let me think about the total distance and the total stops.\n\nTotal riding time: 100 km at 10 km/h = 10 hours.\n\nNumber of stops: how many times does she stop? She stops after every 15 km except the last. So 100/15 = 6.666... So she completes 6 full 15 km segments, so 6 stops.\n\nEach stop is 10 minutes, so 6 stops = 60 minutes =1 hour.\n\nSo total time: 10 +1 =11 hours. So answer is C.\n\nWait, but another way: how about she rides 15 km, takes 1.5 hours, then 10 min break. So every 15 km takes 1.6667 hours.\n\nFor 6 segments: 6 *1.6667 =10 hours. Then she has 10 km left, which is 1 hour. But wait, that would be 11 hours. But wait, in this approach, each 15 km includes the stop. So 6 segments: 6 *15=90 km. So 6 *1.6667=10 hours.

To find the number of stops, divide the total distance by the distance covered before each stop:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of stops} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{15} \\right\\rfloor = 6.\n   \\]  \n   Each stop is 10 minutes, so the total rest time is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total rest time} = 6 \\times 10 \\, \\text{minutes} = 60 \\, \\text{minutes} = 1 \\, \\text{hour}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Time**:  \n   Add the riding time and the rest time:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total time} = 10 \\, \\text{hours} + 1 \\, \\text{hour} = 11 \\, \\text{hours}.\n   \\]\n\nThus, Shweta will take **11 hours** to cover 100 km, including rest stops.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Shweta riding her bike. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, she rides at 10 km per hour. Wait, but she stops every 15 km for 10 minutes. And the total distance she needs to cover is 100 km. I need to find out how much time she'll take, including the rest stops.\n\nFirst, I think I should calculate how long she spends riding without considering the stops. Then, figure out how many stops she makes and add that time to the riding time.\n\nSo, she rides at 10 km/h. The formula for time is distance divided by speed. But she's stopping after every 15 km. So how many 15 km segments are there in 100 km?\n\nLet me see, 100 divided by 15. Let me calculate that. 15 times 6 is 90, which is 6 segments, and that leaves 10 km remaining. Wait, but she stops after each 15 km. So after 15 km, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, and then 105 would be beyond 100. So wait, in 100 km, how many times does she stop? Let's see, every 15 km, except maybe the last one if she doesn't need to stop.\n\nWait, she stops at the end of every 15 km. So for 15 km, she stops once. For 30 km, two stops, and so on. But for 100 km, how many times does she complete a 15 km segment?\n\n15 km segments in 100 km: 100 divided by 15 is approximately 6.666. So she completes 6 full 15 km segments, each followed by a rest stop. Then, she has 100 - (6*15) = 100 -90 =10 km left. So she doesn't complete another 15 km, so she doesn't stop after that. So the number of rest stops is 6.\n\nWait, let me double-check. For the first 15 km, she stops once. Then another 15, another stop. So for each 15 km, she stops once except maybe the last part if it's less than 15. So in 90 km, she stops 6 times. Then the last 10 km, she doesn't stop. So total stops are 6, each 10 minutes.\n\nNow, let's calculate the time she spends riding. Each 15 km takes her 15/10 = 1.5 hours. So for 6 segments, that's 6 * 1.5 =9 hours.\n\nThen the last 10 km: 10 km at 10 km/h is 1 hour.\n\nSo total riding time is 9 +1=10 hours.\n\nNow, the stops: 6 stops, each 10 minutes. 6 *10=60 minutes, which is 1 hour.\n\nSo total time is riding time plus stop time: 10 +1=11 hours.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake with the number of stops. So, she stops after every 15 km. So after the first 15 km, she stops. Then after the next 15, another stop. So for 90 km, she's made 6 stops. Then she goes another 10 km without stopping. So yes, 6 stops total.\n\nSo 6 stops *10 minutes is 60 minutes, which is 1 hour.\n\nSo total time is 10 hours riding +1 hour stop=11 hours.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 11 hours.

I need to find out how long she'll take to cover 100 km. Hmm.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. First, her speed is 10 km/h. So without any stops, the time she would take is total distance divided by speed. But she does stop, so I can't just do 100/10 = 10 hours. That's option B, but I think the answer is more than that because of the stops.\n\nWait, how does the stopping work? She stops after every 15 km. So each time she completes 15 km, she rests for 10 minutes. But wait, after the last 15 km, does she need to rest again? Let me think. If she's done 100 km, does she stop after that? Probably not because she's already reached her destination. So the number of stops depends on how many 15 km segments she completes before 100 km.\n\nLet me calculate how many 15 km segments are in 100 km. 100 divided by 15 is about 6.666. So she completes 6 full 15 km segments, and then a partial one for the remaining distance. Wait, but wait\u2014each 15 km after that would require a stop. Or maybe each 15 km she rides, she stops. So the number of stops would be the number of times she completes 15 km, except the last one.\n\nWait, let me think again. She starts riding, goes 15 km, stops for 10 minutes. Then another 15, stops again. So for every 15 km, a stop. But for the last segment, after she reaches 100 km, she doesn't need to stop. So how many stops?\n\nSo 100 divided by 15 is 6 with a remainder. 6*15=90, so she has 10 km left. So she will have 6 stops, right? Because after each 15 km, including the 90th, she stops, then rides the remaining 10 km without stopping.\n\nWait, no. Let me rephrase: She rides 15 km, stops. Then another 15, stops. Repeat until she can't make another 15. So for 100 km, she'll have 6 stops after 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 km. Then she rides the remaining 10 km without stopping. So total stops are 6 times 10 minutes.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check that. For example, suppose she's at 90 km, she stops for 10 minutes, then rides 10 km to reach 100. So she did stop after 90, so that's 6 stops.\n\nNow, calculate the time she spends riding and the time she spends resting.\n\nRiding time: She rides 100 km at 10 km/h. So time is 100 /10 = 10 hours. But wait, that's without stops. But she takes breaks, so the total time will be more than 10 hours.\n\nWait, but she doesn't take a break after each 15 km in the riding time calculation. So the riding time is the same, 10 hours, but the breaks add extra time.\n\nWait no, no. Because she's not riding continuously. She's riding 15 km, then stopping. So each 15 km takes her 15/10 = 1.5 hours, plus 10 minutes stop. So each 15 km segment takes 1.5 + 0.1667 hours (approx 10 minutes). Wait, let me compute that more accurately.\n\n10 minutes is 10/60 = 1/6 hours \u22480.1667 hours.\n\nSo for each 15 km, she spends 1.5 hours riding plus 0.1667 hours resting. So each 15 km segment takes 1.6667 hours.\n\nBut wait, for the last 10 km, she doesn't stop. So perhaps I should compute the time for the first 6 segments (90 km) plus the last 10 km.\n\nWait, the first 6 segments are 15 km each, totaling 90 km. Then the last 10 km is done without stopping.\n\nSo let's compute time for each part.\n\nFirst, the 6 segments of 15 km each.\n\nEach 15 km: riding time is 15/10 = 1.5 hours. Stop time is 10 min = 1/6 hours.\n\nSo per 15 km: 1.5 + 1/6 = (4.5 + 1)/6? Wait, no. Let me compute 1.5 is 3/2 hours, which is 9/6. So 9/6 + 1/6 = 10/6 = 5/3 hours per 15 km.\n\nWait, 5/3 hours is 1.666... hours. So for 6 segments, that's 6 * (5/3) = 10 hours.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because 6 * 5/3 is 10. But 6 *15 is 90 km. So the riding time for 90 km is 90/10 = 9 hours. But with 6 stops, each 10 minutes, which is 6*(10/60) = 1 hour. So total time for 90 km is 9 +1=10 hours. Then she rides another 10 km, which takes 1 hour. So total time is 10 +1=11 hours.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So 90 km takes 10 hours (riding 9h, stops 1h). Then 10 km takes 1 hour. So total is 11 hours.\n\nSo the answer is 11 hours, which is option C.\n\nLet me double-check. 6 stops: each 10 minutes, so 6*10=60 minutes =1 hour. The riding time is 100 km at 10 km/h =10 hours. So total time is 10 +1=11 hours.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the answer is C.\n",
