      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about two cars starting from opposite ends of a highway that's 50 miles long. They're going to meet at some point, and I need to figure out how long it takes for them to meet. The cars are going at 12 mph and 13 mph. Hmm, let me think.\n\nWait, when two objects move towards each other, their speeds add up, right? Because they're approaching each other. So like, if one is going 12 and the other 13, their combined speed is 25 mph. That makes sense because they're moving towards each other, so the distance between them decreases faster.\n\nThe total distance is 50 miles. So I guess I can use the formula: time = distance divided by speed. But wait, which distance and which speed? Oh, right, because they're moving towards each other, the distance is the same 50 miles, and the combined speed is 25 mph. So time should be 50 / 25.\n\nLet me calculate that. 50 divided by 25 is 2. Wait, that's 2 hours. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the options don't have 2 as the first thought. Let me check the options again. Oh, option E is 2, but wait, the options are A)1, B)1.25, C)1.50, D)1.75, E)2.\n\nWait, but wait a second. If they're moving towards each other, the time it takes for them to meet is when the sum of the distances they've traveled equals 50 miles. So yeah, time = total distance divided by combined speed.\n\nSo 50 miles divided by (12 +13) mph. 12+13 is 25, so 50/25 is 2. So the time is 2 hours. But wait, I thought maybe the answer is 2. But looking at the options, E is 2. So that should be the answer. Wait, but the options also have some other numbers. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about each car's distance separately. Car A is going 12 mph, so in t hours, it goes 12t miles. Car B is going 13 mph, so in t hours, 13t miles. Together, 12t +13t = 25t. So 25t =50. So t=2. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nWait, but why is option E 2, but the question says the highway is 50 miles long. Oh wait, the cars start from opposite ends. So yes, the combined distance when they meet is 50. So the time is 2 hours. So the answer is E.\n\nWait, but why is option B 1.25? That's 5/4 hours. Let me check. 12 *1.25 is 15, and 13 *1.25 is 16.25. 15 +16.25 is 31.25, which is less than 50. So that's not enough. So option E must be correct.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check. Let me calculate 2 hours. Car A: 12 *2 =24 miles. Car B:13 *2=26 miles. 24+26=50. Exactly. So yes, they meet after 2 hours. So the answer is E.\n",

Let me do that calculation. 50 divided by 25 is 2. Wait, that can't be right because 25 times 2 is 50, so yeah, that makes sense. So the time would be 2 hours.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 2. So that's the answer? But wait, let me double-check. Oh, wait, no, wait a second. Because both cars are moving towards each other, so the combined speed is correct. So the formula is correct. Time = 50/(12+13) = 50/25 = 2. So yes, 2 hours. So the answer should be E) 2.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, the choices are A) 1, B) 1.25, C) 1.50, D) 1.75, E) 2. So E is 2, which matches my calculation. Hmm, but I feel like maybe I'm missing something because sometimes in these problems, especially with two objects moving towards each other, you have to consider if they start at the same time from opposite ends.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about their individual distances. Let's say after time t, the first car (speed 12 mph) would have traveled 12t miles, and the second (13 mph) would have gone 13t miles. The sum of these two distances should be 50 miles because when they meet, the total distance covered is the length of the highway.\n\nSo, 12t + 13t = 50. That's 25t =50. So t=50/25=2. Yep, same result. So definitely, the time is 2 hours. So the correct answer is E) 2.\n\n\nTo determine how long it will take for the two cars to meet, we start by noting that the cars are moving towards each other from opposite ends of a 50-mile highway. The first car travels at 12 mph, and the second car travels at 13 mph. When two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. Thus, the combined speed is:\n\n\\[\n12 \\, \\text{mph} + 13 \\, \\text{mph} = 25 \\, \\text{mph}.\n\\]\n\nThe total distance between the cars is 50 miles. The time it takes for them to meet can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{50 \\, \\text{miles}}{25 \\, \\text{mph}} = 2 \\, \\text{hours}.\n\\]\n\nTo verify, we can also calculate the individual distances traveled by each car after time \\( t \\). The first car travels \\( 12t \\) miles, and the second car travels \\( 13t \\) miles. The sum of these distances must equal 50 miles:\n\n\\[\n12t + 13t = 50.\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n25t = 50 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad t = \\frac{50}{25} = 2.\n\\]\n\nThus, the time it takes for the cars to meet is 2 hours. Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:\n\n**E) 2.**\n\nAnswer: E",

I need to find out how long it takes for them to meet each other. Hmm, I remember something about relative speed from physics, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nWait, when two objects are moving towards each other, their speeds add up because they're closing the distance between them. Oh right! So the combined speed is the sum of both their speeds. So in this case, 12 mph plus 13 mph would be 25 mph. That makes sense because if one is moving towards the other, the time until they meet depends on how quickly their combined speeds cover the total distance.\n\nSo the total distance is 50 miles. If their combined speed is 25 mph, then the time it takes is the distance divided by the combined speed. So time equals distance over speed. That would be 50 miles divided by 25 mph. Let me do the math: 50 divided by 25 is 2. Wait, but that's two hours? Hmm, but looking at the options, option E is 2, so that would be the answer.\n\nWait a second, did I do that right? Let me double-check. The first car is going 12 mph, so in t hours, it covers 12t miles. The second car is going 13 mph, so it covers 13t miles in the same time. When they meet, the sum of the distances they've covered should equal the total length of the highway, which is 50 miles. So 12t +13t =50. That simplifies to 25t=50. So t=50/25=2.
