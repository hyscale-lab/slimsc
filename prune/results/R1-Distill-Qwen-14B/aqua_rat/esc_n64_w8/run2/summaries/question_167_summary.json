      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about two printers, Printer A and Printer B. Each of them can print half a page per second. The question is asking how long it'll take them to print 100 pages together. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nWait, both printers are the same, right? Each can print 1/2 page every second. So when they work together, I guess their rates add up. Let me think about how that works.\n\nSo, if one printer does 0.5 pages per second, then two printers would do 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 page per second combined. Oh, that's right. Because when you have multiple entities working together on the same task, you add their rates. \n\nSo together, they print 1 page every second. Now, the task is to print 100 pages. If they're doing 1 page per second, then to get 100 pages, it should take 100 seconds, right? Because 100 pages divided by 1 page per second equals 100 seconds. \n\nWait a second, let me double-check. Another way to look at it is to find the time it takes. The formula I remember is Time = Total Work / Combined Rate. The total work here is 100 pages. The combined rate is 1 page per second. So 100 / 1 = 100 seconds. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 100 seconds. So the answer should be C. But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the rates. Each printer's rate is 1/2 page per second, so together it's 1 page per second. Yes, that's correct. So 100 seconds is right.\n",

I need to find out how long it will take both of them working together to print 100 pages. The options are A)25, B)50, C)100, D)200, E)400 seconds.\n\nHmm, right. So each printer is working at a rate of 0.5 pages per second. When they work together, their rates should add up. Oh wait, because when you have two things working together, you add their rates, right? Like, if one does 1 job per hour and another does 2 jobs per hour, together they do 3 per hour. So here, same idea.\n\nSo Printer A's rate is 0.5 pages/sec. Printer B's rate is also 0.5 pages/sec. So together, their combined rate is 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 page per second. Oh, that's easier than I thought.\n\nWait, but wait a second. So together, they can print 1 page every second. So for 100 pages, how much time does it take? If they do 1 page in 1 second, then 100 pages would take 100 seconds. Hmm, but wait, let me think again. Oh, no, wait! Because 1 page per second would mean 100 pages take 100 seconds. So the answer should be C)100 seconds.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me think about it another way. Suppose each printer takes 2 seconds to print one page because 1/2 page per second. So Printer A does 1 page in 2 seconds, same for Printer B. Now, when working together, how much do they do in a second? Each does 0.5, so together 1. So yeah, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, think about how much they do in one second. Both together add up their rates. So 0.5 +0.5 =1 page per second. So for 100 pages, time is 100 /1 =100 seconds. So answer is C.\n\nWait, but what if the problem was about the time each printer takes to print a single page? Because 1/2 page per second means each printer takes 2 seconds per page. Oh wait, that's correct. So if you have two printers each taking 2 seconds per page, working together, how does that affect the total time?\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it in terms of work done. Let's see, the formula is usually Work = Rate \u00d7 Time. So when working together, their rates add.\n\nSo, if each has a rate of 0.5 pages per second, combined rate is 1 page per second. The work needed is 100 pages. So time is 100 pages / (1 page/sec) ) = 100 seconds. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: how many pages do they print in one second together? 0.5 +0.5 =1. So in t seconds, they print t pages. So for 100 pages, t =100. So yes, 100 seconds.\n\nSo the answer should be option C.\n",

So here, same idea.\n\nSo Printer A's rate is 0.5 pages/sec. Printer B's rate is also 0.5 pages/sec. So together, their combined rate is 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 page per second. Oh, that's easier than I thought.\n\nWait, but wait a second. So together, they can print 1 page every second. So for 100 pages, how much time does it take? If they do 1 page in 1 second, then 100 pages would take 100 seconds. Hmm, but wait, let me think again. Oh, no, wait! Because 1 page per second would mean 100 pages take 100 seconds. So the answer should be C)100 seconds.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me think about it another way. Suppose each printer takes 2 seconds to print one page because 1/2 page per second. So Printer A does 1 page in 2 seconds, same for Printer B. Now, when working together, how much do they do in a second? Each does 0.5, so together 1. So yeah, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, think about how much they do in one second. Both together add up their rates. So 0.5 +0.5 =1 page per second. So for 100 pages, time is 100 /1 =100 seconds. So answer is C.\n\nWait, but what if the problem was about the time each printer takes to print a single page? Because 1/2 page per second means each printer takes 2 seconds per page. Oh wait, that's correct. So if you have two printers each taking 2 seconds per page, working together, how does that affect the total time?\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it in terms of work done. Let's see, the formula is usually Work = Rate \u00d7 Time. So when working together, their rates add.\n\nSo, if each has a rate of 0.5 pages per second, combined rate is 1 page per second. The work needed is 100 pages. So time is 100 pages / (1 page/sec) ) = 100 seconds. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: how many pages do they print in one second together? 0.5 +0.5 =1. So in t seconds, they print t pages. So for 100 pages, t =100. So yes, 100 seconds.\n\nSo the answer should be option C.\n\n\nTo determine how long it will take for Printer A and Printer B to print 100 pages together, we start by analyzing their printing rates. Each printer has a rate of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) pages per second. When working together, their rates add up:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Combined rate} = 0.5 \\, \\text{pages/second} + 0.5 \\, \\text{pages/second} = 1 \\, \\text{page/second}.\n\\]\n\nThis means that together, the printers can print 1 page every second. To print 100 pages, the time required is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Total pages}}{\\text{Combined rate}} = \\frac{100 \\, \\text{pages}}{1 \\, \\text{page/second}} = 100 \\, \\text{seconds}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the time it takes for both printers to print 100 pages together is **100 seconds**.\n\nAnswer: C",

Right, when things work together, their rates add up. So I should add their printing speeds.\n\nSo Printer A is 0.5 pages/sec, and Printer B is also 0.5 pages/sec. Adding those together gives 1 page per second. Oh wait, that makes sense because two of them together would double the speed. So together, they can print 1 page every second.\n\nWait, wait a minute.
