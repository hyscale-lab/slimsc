      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about magazine subscriptions. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question says that a subscription for 15 issues costs $42.00 and that this represents a 25% saving compared to buying each issue individually. I need to find out what the cover price per issue is.\n\nHmm, so the subscription is cheaper than buying each issue. The saving is 25%, which I think means that the subscription price is 25% less than the total cover price of all 15 issues. So, the $42 is 75% of the total cover price because 100% minus 25% saving equals 75% of the original.\n\nWait, let me think about that again. If you save 25%, then you're paying 75% of the original price. So the subscription cost is 75% of what you'd pay if you bought each issue at the cover price.\n\nRight, so the total cover price for 15 issues would be higher than $42. Let me write this down.\n\nLet me denote the total cover price as T. Then, the subscription price is 75% of T. So,\n\nSubscription price = 0.75 * T\n\nWe know the subscription is $42, so:\n\n42 = 0.75 * T\n\nTo find T, I can rearrange this equation. So T = 42 / 0.75.\n\nLet me calculate that. 42 divided by 0.75. Hmm, 0.75 is the same as 3/4. So dividing by 3/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/3. So 42 * (4/3) equals?\n\n42 divided by 3 is 14, so 14 multiplied by 4 is 56. So T is $56.\n\nSo the total cover price for 15 issues is $56. Now, to find the cover price per issue, I divide that by 15.\n\nCover price per issue = 56 / 15.\n\nLet me compute that. 15 times 3 is 45, which leaves 11. So 3.733... approximately. Wait, 56 divided by 15: 15 * 3 =45, 56-45=11. 11 divided by 15 is about 0.7333. So together, 3.7333 dollars per issue. \n\nLooking at the options, let's see. Option A is $7.73, which seems way too high. B is $6.73, still higher. C is $5.73, D is $4.73, E is $3.73. Wait, my calculation gave me approximately 3.7333. So that would round to about $3.73. Looking at the options, E is $3.73.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations. Because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nFirst, the subscription is 25% off, so the price is 75% of the cover price. So yes, 42 is 75% of T. So T=56, correct.\n\nThen, 56 divided by 15. Let me compute that more accurately. 15 * 3 =45. 56-45=11. Bring down a zero, 110 divided by 15 is 7 (15*7=105), remainder 5. Bring down another zero, 50 divided by 15 is 3 (15*3=45), remainder 5 again. So it's 3.7333... So approximately $3.73.\n\nBut wait, the options don't have 3.73 as the first option. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA)7.73\nB)6.73\nC)5.73\nD)4.73\nE)3.73\n\nYes, E is 3.73. So the correct answer should be E.\n\nWait a second, but I'm a bit confused because 3.73 per issue seems low. Let me think again: 15 issues at 3.73 each would be 15 *3.73.\n\nLet me calculate 15 *3.73. 3.73 *10 is 37.3, 3.73*5=18.65. So 37.3 +18.65=55.95, which is approximately $56. So that matches with the total T of $56.\n\nSo yeah, that makes sense. So the cover price per issue is $3.73, which is option E.\n",

Hmm, a subscription for 15 issues costs $42.00, and this represents a 25% saving compared to buying each issue at the cover price. I need to find out what the cover price per issue is. The options are A to E, with various numbers. \n\nAlright, let me break this down. So normally, if each issue is bought separately, the total cost would be higher because of the saving. The subscription gives a 25% discount, I think. Wait, the problem says it's a saving of 25 percent. So does that mean the subscription price is 25% less than the total cover price?\n\nI think that's right. So normally, if you bought each issue at the cover price, you'd pay more. The subscription is cheaper because it's saving you 25% on the total cover price. So the subscription cost is 75% of the total cover price for 15 issues.\n\nLet me write that down. Let's denote the total cover price for 15 issues as T. The subscription price is $42, which is 75% of T. So:\n\nSubscription Price = T - 25% of T = 75% of T\nSo 42 = 0.75 * T\n\nTo find T, I can divide 42 by 0.75. Let me do that calculation. 42 divided by 0.75. Hmm, 0.75 is 3/4, so dividing by 3/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/3. So 42 * (4/3) = (42/3)*4 = 14*4 = 56. So T is $56. \n\nWait, that makes sense because if the subscription is cheaper by 25%, then the total cover price without discount is higher. So 42 is 75% of 56. Now, since T is the total cover price for 15 issues, the cover price per issue would be T divided by 15. So 56 divided by 15.\n\nLet me calculate that. 56 \u00f7 15. Hmm, 15 times 3 is 45, which leaves 11. So 3 and 11/15. 11 divided by 15 is approximately 0.7333... So 3.7333... dollars per issue.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is $3.73. But wait, let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, wait, I think I messed up the initial setup. Let me double-check. The subscription is a saving of 25%, which means the subscription price is 25% less than the total cover price. So Subscription Price = Cover Price - 25% of Cover Price. Which is 75% of Cover Price. So yes, 42 is 75% of T. So T is 42 / 0.75 = 56. \n\nSo each issue's cover price is 56 /15. Let me compute that again. 56 \u00f715. Let's see: 15 times 3 is 45. 56 minus 45 is 11. So 3 with 11/15 remaining. 11/15 is approximately 0.7333. So each issue is about $3.7333, which rounds to $3.73. So option E.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)7.73, B)6.73, C)5.73, D)4.73, E)3.73. So E is $3.73.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. If the subscription is a saving of 25%, does that mean that the subscription price is 25% less than the total cover price? Or is it that each issue is 25% off?\n\nWait, the problem says it's a saving of 25% of the cover prices. Hmm, perhaps I interpreted that correctly. Let me read it again: \"represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices.\" Oh, wait, perhaps I should think of it as the total saving is 25% of the sum of the cover prices. So the subscription price is (100% -25%) of the total cover prices. Which is what I did earlier.\n\nSo 42 is 75% of the total cover price, which is 56. Divided by 15 issues, that's about 3.73 per issue. So the answer should be E.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Let me think of it another way. Suppose each issue's cover price is C. So 15 issues would cost 15C. The subscription price is 42, which is 25% less than 15C. So 42 = 15C - 0.25*(15C) = 0.75*(15C). So yes, same as before. So 42 = 11.25 C. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 0.75*(15C) = 11.25 C. So 11.25 C =42. So C =42 /11.25. Let me compute that.\n\n42 divided by 11.25. Hmm. 11.25 times 3 is 33.75. 42 minus 33.75 is 8.25. 11.25 goes into 8.25 about 0.7333 times. So 3.7333... So same as before. So each issue is about $3.73. So E is correct.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about magazine subscriptions and figuring out the cover price per issue. Hmm, let's see. I need to break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says that a subscription for 15 issues costs $42.00, and this represents a 25% saving compared to buying each issue at the cover price. So, my goal is to find out how much each issue costs when bought individually, right?\n\nWait, saving of 25 percent... That probably means the subscription price is 25% less than the total cover price for the 15 issues. Oh wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think. If I buy the subscription, I'm saving 25% compared to buying each issue. So the subscription is cheaper because it's a discounted price. So, the subscription price is 75% of the total cover price for the 15 issues. Because 100% minus 25% saving equals 75% of the original price.\n\nSo, let me put that into math terms. Let me denote the total cover price for 15 issues as T. Then, the subscription price ($42) is 75% of T. So, 42 = 0.75 * T. To find T, I can rearrange that equation. T = 42 / 0.75.\n\nCalculating that, 42 divided by 0.75. Let me do that division. 0.75 is the same as 3/4, so dividing by 3/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/3. So 42 * (4/3) = 56. Oh wait, because 42 divided by 0.75 is 56? Let me check: 0.75 times 56 is 42. Yes, because 56 * 0.75 = 56*(3/4) = (56/4)*3 = 14 *3=42. Yes, correct. So the total cover price for all 15 issues is $56.\n\nNow, to find the cover price per issue, I just divide that total by the number of issues, which is 15. So 56 divided by 15. Let me calculate that. 15 times 3 is 45, which is less than 56. 15 *3.7 is 55.5. Hmm, 3.73 times 15 would be 3.73 *10=37.3, 3.73*5=18.65, so 37.3+18.65=55.95, which is close to 56. So, 3.73 per issue would give a total of about 55.95, which is almost 56. So, the cover price per issue is approximately $3.73.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I did that correctly. 15 times 3.73: 3.73 *10 is 37.3, 3.73 *5 is 18.65. Adding those together gives 55.95, which is $0.05 less than 56. So perhaps the exact value is a bit higher, but in the options, the closest is E) $3.73.\n\nWait, but the options are A)7.73, B)6.73, C)5.73, D)4.73, E)3.73. So E is $3.73, which matches my calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should do the division more accurately. 56 divided by 15.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about magazine subscriptions and figuring out the cover price per issue. Hmm, let's see. I need to break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says that a subscription for 15 issues costs $42.00, and this represents a 25% saving compared to buying each issue at the cover price. So, my goal is to find out how much each issue costs when bought individually, right?\n\nWait, saving of 25 percent... That probably means the subscription price is 25% less than the total cover price for the 15 issues. Oh wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think. If I buy the subscription, I'm saving 25% compared to buying each issue. So the subscription is cheaper because it's a discounted price. So, the subscription price is 75% of the total cover price for the 15 issues. Because 100% minus 25% saving equals 75% of the original price.\n\nSo, let me put that into math terms. Let me denote the total cover price for 15 issues as T. Then, the subscription price ($42) is 75% of T. So, 42 = 0.75 * T. To find T, I can rearrange that equation. T = 42 / 0.75.\n\nCalculating that, 42 divided by 0.75. Let me do that division. 0.75 is the same as 3/4, so dividing by 3/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/3. So 42 * (4/3) = 56. Oh wait, because 42 divided by 0.75 is 56? Let me check: 0.75 times 56 is 42. Yes, because 56 * 0.75 = 56*(3/4) = (56/4)*3 = 14 *3=42. Yes, correct. So the total cover price for all 15 issues is $56.\n\nNow, to find the cover price per issue, I just divide that total by the number of issues, which is 15. So 56 divided by 15. Let me calculate that. 15 times 3 is 45, which is less than 56. 15 *3.7 is 55.5. Hmm, 3.73 times 15 would be 3.73 *10=37.3, 3.73*5=18.65, so 37.3+18.65=55.95, which is close to 56. So, 3.73 per issue would give a total of about 55.95, which is almost 56. So, the cover price per issue is approximately $3.73.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I did that correctly. 15 times 3.73: 3.73 *10 is 37.3, 3.73 *5 is 18.65. Adding those together gives 55.95, which is $0.05 less than 56. So perhaps the exact value is a bit higher, but in the options, the closest is E) $3.73.\n\nWait, but the options are A)7.73, B)6.73, C)5.73, D)4.73, E)3.73. So E is $3.73, which matches my calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should do the division more accurately. 56 divided by 15. Let me compute 15 into 56.\n\n15 goes into 56 three times (15*3=45), subtract 45 from 56, remainder 11. Bring down a zero; 110 divided by 15 is 7 (15*7=105), remainder 5. Bring down another zero: 50. 15 goes into 50 three times (15*3=45), remainder 5. So it's 3.733... So approximately $3.73 per issue. So the answer should be E.\n\n\nTo determine the cover price per issue, we start by noting that the subscription price of $42.00 represents a 25% saving compared to the total cover price for 15 issues. This means the subscription price is 75% of the total cover price. Let the total cover price for 15 issues be \\( T \\).

Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe question says that a subscription for 15 issues of a magazine costs $42.00, and this subscription represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices. I need to find the cover price per issue.\n\nHmm, right. So normally, each issue has a cover price, and when you buy a subscription, you get a discount. The discount here is 25%, which means you're paying 75% of the total cover price for all 15 issues. Or wait, maybe the subscription price is 25% less than the total cover price? Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the subscription is a saving of 25 percent. So, that means the subscription price is 25% less than the total cover price of 15 issues. So, if I let the total cover price be X, then the subscription price is X minus 25% of X, which is 0.75X. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think again.\n\nIf the subscription represents a 25% saving, that means the subscription is cheaper than the total cover price by 25%. So the subscription price is 75% of the total cover price. Because 100% minus 25% saving is 75%.\n\nSo, mathematically, Subscription Price = Total Cover Price * (1 - 0.25) = 0.75 * Total Cover Price.\n\nWe know the subscription price is $42.00. So, 42 = 0.75 * Total Cover Price. So, to find the total cover price, I can rearrange that as Total Cover Price = 42 / 0.75.\n\nLet me calculate that. 42 divided by 0.75. Hmm, 42 divided by 3/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/3. So 42 * (4/3) = (42 /3)*4 = 14 *4 =56. So the total cover price for all 15 issues is $56.\n\nWait, wait a second. That makes sense because if I save 25%, the total cover price is higher than the subscription. So, for 15 issues, the total cover price is $56. So each issue's cover price is 56 divided by 15.\n\nLet me compute that. 56 divided by 15. 15 goes into 56 three times (15*3=45). The remainder is 11. So, 3. So 3 and 11/15, which is approximately 3.733... So, that's about $3.73 per issue.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check my math again. Because 56 divided by 15: 15 * 3 =45, 56-45=11. So 3 and 11/15. 11 divided by 15 is 0.7333... So, 3.7333, which is approximately $3.73.\n\nBut looking at the options, option E is $3.73. So that's the answer, right?\n\nWait, but wait again. Let me double-check because sometimes I might have mixed up the calculations.\n\nWait, another approach: If the subscription is 25% off, then the subscription is 75% of the total cover price. So, 42 is 75% of the total cover price. So total cover is 42 / 0.75 = 56. Then, 56 divided by 15 is approximately 3.7333 per issue. So yes, that's correct. So the answer is E, $3.73.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Another way to think: Each issue's cover price is X. 15 issues would cost 15X. The subscription is 42, which is a 25% saving. So, 42 is 75% of 15X. So, 42 = 0.75 * 15X. 42 = 11.25 X. So X = 42 / 11.25. Let me calculate that.\n\n42 divided by 11.25. Let's see. 11.25 times 3 is 33.75, 11.25*3.7 is 41.625. 42-41.625=0.375. 0.375 is 0.0333... So 3.7 + 0.0333 is approximately 3.7333. So same as before, $3.73.\n\nYes, so that's consistent.

I need to find out what the cover price per issue is.\n\nWait, so the subscription is cheaper than buying each issue individually by 25%. So, the $42 is the price after a 25% discount off the total cover price for 15 issues. Oh wait, no, actually, the way it's phrased is that the subscription represents a saving of 25% of the cover prices. So, the subscription price is 25% less than the total cover price for 15 issues.\n\nLet me think: If the subscription is a saving of 25%, that means the subscription price is 75% of the total cover price. Because 100% minus 25% saving is 75% of the original price.\n\nSo, let me denote the total cover price for 15 issues as T. Then, the subscription price is 75% of T.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about magazine subscriptions and cover prices. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. \n\nThe question says that a subscription for 15 issues costs $42.00 and that this represents a 25% saving compared to buying each issue at the cover price. I need to find out what the cover price per issue is.\n\nWait, so the subscription is cheaper than buying each issue individually by 25%. So, the $42 is the price after a 25% discount off the total cover price for 15 issues. Oh wait, no, actually, the way it's phrased is that the subscription represents a saving of 25% of the cover prices. So, the subscription price is 25% less than the total cover price for 15 issues.\n\nLet me think: If the subscription is a saving of 25%, that means the subscription price is 75% of the total cover price. Because 100% minus 25% saving is 75% of the original price.\n\nSo, let me denote the total cover price for 15 issues as T. Then, the subscription price is 75% of T. So, 42 = 0.75 * T.\n\nWait, no, wait a second. Let me get this right. If the subscription is a saving of 25%, that saving is 25% of the cover price total. So, the subscription price is the original cover price minus 25% of that. So, yes, 42 is 75% of T, where T is the total cover price for 15 issues.\n\nSo, 42 = 0.75 * T. To find T, I can rearrange that: T = 42 / 0.75. Let me calculate that. 42 divided by 0.75. Hmm, 42 divided by 3/4 is 42 multiplied by 4/3. 42 times 4 is 168, divided by 3 is 56. So T is $56.\n\nWait, so the total cover price for 15 issues is $56. Therefore, each issue's cover price is 56 divided by 15. Let me compute that.\n\n56 divided by 15. 15 times 3 is 45, which leaves 11. 11/15 is approximately 0.7333. So 3.7333 per issue.

I need to find the cover price per issue. \n\nWait, so the subscription is cheaper because it's a bulk purchase, right? The saving is 25%, so the $42 is 25% less than the total cover price of all 15 issues. Or is it the other way around? I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Oh wait, when they say it's a saving of 25%, that means the subscription price is 25% less than the total cover price. So the subscription is 75% of the total cover price.\n\nRight, because if the cover price is the original, and you save 25%, then you're paying 75% of that. So, if I let the total cover price be X, then 75% of X equals $42. So mathematically, 0.75 * X = 42. Then, to find X, I divide 42 by 0.75. Let me calculate that.\n\n42 divided by 0.75. Hmm, 0.75 is the same as 3/4. So 42 divided by (3/4) is the same as 42 multiplied by (4/3). Let's see: 42 * 4 = 168, and 168 divided by 3 is 56. So X is $56. That's the total cover price for 15 issues.\n\nNow, to find the cover price per issue, I divide the total by the number of issues. So 56 divided by 15. Let me compute that. 15 goes into 56 three times, which is 45. 56 minus 45 is 11. Bring down a zero; 15 into 110 is seven times (15*7=105), which leaves 5.

If I didn't have the subscription, I'd pay 15 times the cover price. The saving is 25%, so the $42 is 75% of the total. So yeah, same calculation. So the cover price per issue is $3.73.
