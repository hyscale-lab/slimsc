      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about renting DVDs and memberships. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe question is asking: You can rent DVDs at a local video store for $4 each without a membership. If you buy a membership for $7 a month, you can rent each DVD for $2. They want to know the minimum number of DVDs I need to rent to make the membership worth it.\n\nHmm, so I think the idea is to compare the total cost without the membership versus the total cost with the membership. I need to find out when the total cost with the membership becomes cheaper or at least not more expensive than paying per rental without the membership.\n\nLet me break it down. Without a membership, each DVD is $4. So if I rent 'x' number of DVDs, the total cost is 4x dollars.\n\nWith the membership, I pay a flat fee of $7 per month, plus $2 per DVD. So the total cost here is 7 + 2x dollars.\n\nI need to find the smallest 'x' where the cost with membership is less than or equal to the cost without. So set up the inequality: 4x \u2265 7 + 2x. Wait, no, actually, the membership becomes worth it when the cost is lower. So maybe I should set 4x > 7 + 2x, and find when 4x is greater than 7+2x. Because that's when the membership is cheaper. Wait, wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the cost without membership is 4x. The cost with membership is 7 + 2x. I want to find when 7 + 2x is less than 4x. Because that's when it's cheaper to get the membership.\n\nSo, 7 + 2x < 4x.\n\nLet's solve for x.\n\nSubtract 2x from both sides: 7 < 2x.\n\nDivide both sides by 2: 7/2 < x \u2192 3.5 < x.\n\nBut x has to be an integer because you can't rent half a DVD. So x must be greater than 3.5. So the smallest integer x is 4.\n\nWait, but let me check the numbers for x=3 and x=4.\n\nFor x=3: Without membership, 3*4=12. With membership, 7 + 3*2=7+6=13. So 13 is more than 12. So at 3, it's not worth it.\n\nFor x=4: Without, 4*4=16. With, 7 + 4*2=7+8=15. 15 is less than 16. So at x=4, it's cheaper to get the membership.\n\nSo the minimum number is 4. Looking at the options, D is 4. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me double-check. Maybe I should set it as when the cost with membership is less than or equal to without. So 7 + 2x \u2264 4x.\n\nWhich simplifies to 7 \u2264 2x \u2192 x \u2265 3.5. So x must be 4.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n",

So yes, D is the answer.\n\n\nTo determine the minimum number of DVDs needed to make purchasing the membership worth it, we compare the total costs of renting without and with the membership.\n\n1. **Cost without membership**: Each DVD costs $4.00, so the total cost is \\( 4n \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of DVDs rented.\n\n2. **Cost with membership**: The membership fee is $7.00 per month, and each additional DVD costs $2.00. Thus, the total cost is \\( 7 + 2n \\).\n\nTo find when the membership becomes more economical, we set up the inequality:\n\\[\n7 + 2n \\leq 4n\n\\]\n\n3. **Solving the inequality**:\n   - Subtract \\( 2n \\) from both sides: \\( 7 \\leq 2n \\).\n   - Divide both sides by 2: \\( n \\geq 3.5 \\).\n\nSince \\( n \\) must be a whole number (you cannot rent half a DVD), the smallest integer greater than or equal to 3.5 is 4. \n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - If \\( n = 4 \\): \n     - Cost without membership: \\( 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\) dollars.\n     - Cost with membership: \\( 7 + 4 \\times 2 = 15 \\) dollars.\n     - The membership is cheaper: \\( 15 < 16 \\).\n\n   - If \\( n = 3 \\): \n     - Cost without membership: \\( 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\) dollars.\n     - Cost with membership: \\( 7 + 3 \\times 2 = 13 \\) dollars.\n     - The membership is more expensive: \\( 13 > 12 \\).\n\nThus, renting at least 4 DVDs makes the membership worth it.\n\nAnswer: D",

Thus, the total cost for renting \\( x \\) DVDs is \\( 7 + 2x \\).\n\nWe need to find the smallest \\( x \\) where the total cost with the membership (\\( 7 + 2x \\)) is less than or equal to the total cost without the membership (\\( 4x \\)). Setting up the inequality:\n\n\\[\n7 + 2x \\leq 4x\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\( 2x \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n7 \\leq 2x\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[\nx \\geq 3.5\n\\]\n\nSince \\( x \\) must be a whole number, we round up to \\( x = 4 \\). To verify:\n\n- For \\( x = 4 \\):  \n  Without membership: \\( 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\)  \n  With membership: \\( 7 + 4 \\times 2 = 15 \\)  \n  The total cost with membership is cheaper.\n\n- For \\( x = 3 \\):  \n  Without membership: \\( 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\)  \n  With membership: \\( 7 + 3 \\times 2 = 13 \\)  \n  The total cost with membership is more expensive.\n\nThus, the minimum number of DVDs needed to make purchasing the membership worth it is 4.\n\nAnswer: D",

Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nSo, without a membership, each DVD costs $4.00. If I buy a membership for $7.00 per month, then each DVD only costs $2.00. I need to find out the minimum number of DVDs I have to rent each month so that the total cost with the membership is less than or equal to not having the membership.\n\nWait, wait. Let me clarify. The question is asking, how many DVDs do I need to rent so that purchasing the membership becomes the better option. So, I guess I need to compare the total cost of renting without membership to the total cost when buying the membership.\n\nLet me set up an equation. Let's say I rent 'x' DVDs. Without the membership, the cost is 4x dollars. With the membership, it's 7 dollars (for the membership) plus 2x dollars for the x DVDs.\n\nI want to find the smallest x where 7 + 2x is less than 4x. Because that's when the membership becomes worth it.\n\nSo, the inequality is:\n7 + 2x < 4x\n\nLet me solve for x. Subtract 2x from both sides:\n7 < 2x\n\nThen, divide both sides by 2:\n7/2 < x\n3.5 < x\n\nSince x has to be an integer (you can't rent half a DVD), x must be at least 4. Because 3.5 is not enough, you need to round up to the next whole number.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If I rent 3 DVDs: Without membership, that's 3*4=12. With membership, 7 + 3*2=13. So 13 is more than 12, so it's not worth it. What about 4 DVDs? Without membership, 4*4=16. With membership, 7+4*2=15. Oh, 15 is less than 16.
