That means my brother was 1 year old at that time because half of 2 is 1. Okay, so when I was 2, he was 1. That tells me that the age difference between us is 1 year.

So the answer should be 59, which is option A.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Let's think step by step. When I was 2, brother was 1. So the age difference is 1 year. That difference doesn't change as time passes. So if I'm now 60, subtracting the 1-year difference, he's 59. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nI don't think I'm missing anything here.

So, when the speaker was 2, their brother was half their age. That means the brother was 1 year old at that time, right?

If the speaker is older than their brother by a certain number of years, that difference doesn't change as they grow older.\n\nSo, when the speaker was 2, the brother was 1. So the age difference is 1 year. Wait, no, wait. If the speaker is older, then the difference would be the speaker's age minus the brother's age. When the speaker was 2, brother was 1.

So he's 59 now. \n\nLooking at the options, option A is 59. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Another way: the age difference is always the same. When I was 2, he was 1, so difference is 1. So now, I'm 60, he's 60 -1=59. Yeah, that's correct.\n\n\nWhen you were 2 years old, your brother was half your age, meaning he was 1 year old. This indicates that you are 1 year older than your brother. The age difference between you remains constant over time. Now that you are 60 years old, your brother's age is calculated by subtracting the age difference (1 year) from your current age: \n\n\\[\n60 - 1 = 59\n\\]\n\nThus, your brother is 59 years old. \n\nAnswer: A",

The question says, when I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age. Now I'm 60, how old is he?\n\nWait, let me break this down. When I was 2, my brother was half my age. So if I'm 2, half of that is 1. That means when I was 2, my brother was 1 year old. Oh, right, so he was younger than me by one year then.\n\nSo the age difference between us is always the same, right? Because age differences don't change over time. If I was 2 and he was 1, the difference is 1 year. So I'm always one year older than him. Wait, no, wait. Because if I was older by a year, then when I'm 60, he'd be 59. Because 60 minus 1 is 59. So is the answer 59?\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let's think about it another way. Let's call my current age Y and my brother's age B. The age difference is Y - B, which is constant.\n\nWhen I was 2, he was 1. So the difference is 2 - 1 = 1 year. So Y is now 60, so B should be 60 - 1 = 59. So yes, option A is 59.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Could the problem be tricking me? Sometimes these problems have a twist. Like, maybe the brother's age is calculated differently. But in this case, it seems straightforward.\n\nSo when I was 2, brother was 1. So the age difference is 1 year. So now, when I'm 60, he's 60 -1 =59. So the correct answer is A.\n",
