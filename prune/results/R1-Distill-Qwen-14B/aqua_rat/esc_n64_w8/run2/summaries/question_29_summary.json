      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a jeep traveling a certain distance, and I need to find out how far it went. Hmm, let's see. The question says that the jeep takes 6 hours for the forward journey. Then, on the return trip, it increases its speed by 12 km/hr and takes 4 hours. I remember that distance equals speed multiplied by time, so maybe I can set up some equations with that.\n\nWait, so for the forward journey, the speed would be distance divided by time. Let me denote the distance as D. So the speed during the forward trip is D divided by 6 hours. Let me write that down: speed_forward = D / 6.\n\nThen, on the return trip, the speed is higher by 12 km/hr. So the return speed would be (D/6) + 12. And the time taken for the return trip is 4 hours. But wait, the distance for the return trip is the same as the forward trip, right? So using the same distance D, the return speed multiplied by time should also equal D. So, I can write that equation as (D/6 + 12) * 4 = D.\n\nLet me expand that. Multiply 4 into the terms inside the parentheses. So 4*(D/6) is (4D)/6, which simplifies to (2D)/3. And 4*12 is 48. So the equation becomes (2D/3) + 48 = D.\n\nHmm, now I need to solve for D. Let's subtract (2D/3) from both sides to get all the D terms on one side. So, 48 = D - (2D/3). What's D minus 2D/3? That's the same as (3D/3 - 2D/3) which equals D/3. So now the equation is 48 = D/3.\n\nOh wait, to find D, I can multiply both sides by 3. So D = 48 *3. Let's calculate that. 48 times 3 is 144. So D is 144 km. Let me check the options. Option B is 144, so that's probably the answer.\n\nWait a second, did I do everything right? Let me double-check. The forward speed is 144/6 which is 24 km/h. Return speed is 24 +12 =36 km/h. Time taken would be 144/36=4 hours. Yep, that matches the given data. So yeah, the distance is 144 km.\n",

Let's subtract (2D/3) from both sides to get all the D terms on one side. So, 48 = D - (2D/3). What's D minus 2D/3? That's the same as (3D/3 - 2D/3) which equals D/3. So now the equation is 48 = D/3.\n\nOh wait, to find D, I can multiply both sides by 3. So D = 48 *3. Let's calculate that. 48 times 3 is 144. So D is 144 km. Let me check the options.

I need to find the distance it traveled.\n\nWait, so the distance should be the same for both journeys, right? Because it's going somewhere and then coming back. So, the distance is the same whether it's going or returning. Let's call that distance 'd'.\n\nI remember that distance equals speed multiplied by time. So, for the forward journey, the speed would be d divided by 6 hours. Let me write that down: speed_forward = d / 6.\n\nOn the return trip, the speed is higher. It says it increased by 12 km/hr. So the return speed is speed_forward + 12. Which would be (d/6) + 12.\n\nBut wait, wait. Or is the return speed 12 km/hr more than the forward speed? Yeah, I think that's what it means. So, speed_return = speed_forward + 12.\n\nAnd the time taken for the return journey is 4 hours. So, using the same distance formula, d = speed_return * 4. So, d = (speed_forward + 12) * 4.\n\nBut I can substitute speed_forward with d/6. Let's do that. So, d = (d/6 + 12) * 4.\n\nNow, I can set up the equation and solve for d. Let's expand that.\n\nd = 4*(d/6) + 4*12\nd = (4d/6) + 48\nSimplify 4d/6 to 2d/3. So,\n\nd = (2d/3) + 48.\n\nHmm, I need to solve for d.

So the distance here is (v + 12) * 4.\n\nWait, but the distance going forward and returning should be the same, right? Because it's the same path, just in opposite directions. So I can set the two distance expressions equal to each other.\n\nSo, v * 6 = (v + 12) * 4. Let me write that equation down.\n\n6v = 4(v + 12)\n\nExpanding the right side: 6v = 4v + 48.\n\nNow, subtract 4v from both sides: 6v - 4v = 48. So 2v =48. Therefore, v = 24 km/hr.\n\nOh, wait, so the initial speed is 24 km/h. Now, to find the distance, I can plug this back into either of the distance equations. Let's use the first one: distance = 24 *6.\n\n24 times 6 is... 144. So the distance is 144 km.\n\nLooking at the options, B is 144. So that should be the answer.\n\n\nThe jeep travels the same distance during both the forward and return journeys. Let the speed during the forward journey be \\( v \\) km/hr. The distance for the forward journey is \\( v \\times 6 \\).\n\nOn the return journey, the speed increases by 12 km/hr, making it \\( v + 12 \\) km/hr, and the time taken is 4 hours. Thus, the distance for the return journey is \\( (v + 12) \\times 4 \\).\n\nSince the distances are equal:\n\\[\nv \\times 6 = (v + 12) \\times 4\n\\]\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\\[\n6v = 4v + 48\n\\]\n\\[\n2v = 48\n\\]\n\\[\nv = 24 \\, \\text{km/hr}\n\\]\n\nThe distance is then:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = v \\times 6 = 24 \\times 6 = 144 \\, \\text{km}\n\\]\n\nThus, the distance traveled by the jeep is **144 km**.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a jeep traveling a certain distance. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nAlright, the problem says that the jeep takes 6 hours for the forward journey. Then, on the return trip, it increases its speed by 12 km/hr and takes 4 hours. I need to find the distance it traveled. \n\nWait, the distance should be the same for both journeys, right? Because it's going and then coming back the same path. So the distance is the same whether it's going forward or returning.\n\nLet me think about the variables. Let's say the speed during the forward journey is 'v' km/hr. Then, the speed on the return trip would be 'v + 12' km/hr. \n\nSince speed is distance divided by time, I can write two equations based on the forward and return trips. \n\nFor the forward trip:\nDistance = speed \u00d7 time. So, Distance = v \u00d7 6.\n\nFor the return trip:\nDistance = (v + 12) \u00d7 4.\n\nSince both distances are the same, I can set these two equations equal to each other. So:\n\nv \u00d7 6 = (v + 12) \u00d7 4.\n\nHmm, now I need to solve for v. Let me expand the right side. \n\n6v = 4(v + 12)\n6v = 4v + 48.\n\nSubtract 4v from both sides: 6v -4v =48 \u2192 2v=48.\n\nDivide both sides by 2: v=24 km/hr. \n\nSo the speed on the forward trip is 24 km/hr. Now I can find the distance by plugging back into either equation. Let's use the forward trip: distance = 24 \u00d76 = 144 km.\n\nWait, but let me double-check with the return trip. The return speed is 24+12=36 km/hr. Time is 4 hours. So distance is 36\u00d74=144 km. Yep, that matches. \n\nSo the distance is 144 km, which is option B.\n\n\nThe jeep travels the same distance during both the forward and return journeys. Let the speed during the forward journey be \\( v \\) km/hr. The speed during the return journey is \\( v + 12 \\) km/hr. Using the formula \\( \\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} \\), we can write:\n\n- For the forward journey:  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Distance} = v \\times 6\n  \\]\n\n- For the return journey:  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Distance} = (v + 12) \\times 4\n  \\]\n\nSince the distances are equal, we set the two equations equal to each other:  \n\\[\n6v = 4(v + 12)\n\\]\n\nExpanding and simplifying:  \n\\[\n6v = 4v + 48 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2v = 48 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v = 24 \\, \\text{km/hr}\n\\]\n\nThe speed during the forward journey is \\( v = 24 \\, \\text{km/hr} \\). Substituting this into the distance formula for the forward journey:  \n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = 24 \\times 6 = 144 \\, \\text{km}\n\\]\n\nTo verify, the return speed is \\( 24 + 12 = 36 \\, \\text{km/hr} \\), and the distance is:  \n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = 36 \\times 4 = 144 \\, \\text{km}\n\\]\n\nBoth calculations confirm the distance is \\( 144 \\, \\text{km} \\).  \n\nAnswer: B",
