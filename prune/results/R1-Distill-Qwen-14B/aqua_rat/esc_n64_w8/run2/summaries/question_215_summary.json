      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about mixing soft drinks. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says that one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water. And the question is, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink.\n\nWait, I think I need to set up some variables here. Let's see. Initially, we have 1 gallon of soft drink. So the amount of orange juice in that is 40% of a gallon. Oh right, 0.4 gallons of OJ. And the rest is water, which is 0.6 gallons.\n\nNow, we want to add more orange juice. Let's say we add x gallons of OJ. So the total volume after adding will be the original 1 gallon plus x gallons of OJ. So the total volume becomes (1 + x) gallons.\n\nIn this new mixture, the amount of orange juice is the original 0.4 gallons plus the added x gallons, so that's (0.4 + x) gallons. And we want this orange juice to make up 60% of the total mixture. So the equation would be:\n\n(0.4 + x) = 0.6 * (1 + x)\n\nWait, let me write that down correctly. Yes, because 60% of the total is the desired OJ content.\n\nSo now I can solve for x. Let's expand the right side:\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6*(1) + 0.6*x\n0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x\n\nNow I'll subtract 0.6x from both sides to get:\n\n0.4 + 0.4x = 0.6\n\nThen subtract 0.4 from both sides:\n\n0.4x = 0.6 - 0.4\n0.4x = 0.2\n\nDivide both sides by 0.4:\n\nx = 0.2 / 0.4\nx = 0.5\n\nWait, so x is 0.5 gallons. That would mean we need to add half a gallon of orange juice. Let me check that.\n\nOriginal OJ: 0.4 gallons. Add 0.5, so total OJ is 0.9 gallons. The total volume is 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 gallons. 0.9 / 1.5 = 0.6, which is 60%. That works.\n\nLooking at the options, A is 0.5. So the answer should be A.\n",

The options are A to E.\n\nHmm, I think I should start by understanding what the current situation is. Right now, we have 1 gallon of this drink. 40% is orange juice, which is 0.4 gallons, and 60% is water, which is 0.6 gallons.\n\nThe goal is to have orange juice make up 60% of the new mixture. So I guess we're adding more orange juice to the existing mixture, and after adding, the total volume increases, but the percentage of orange juice goes up.\n\nWait, so let's say we add x gallons of orange juice. After adding, the total volume becomes 1 + x gallons. The amount of orange juice becomes 0.4 + x gallons because we're adding x gallons of pure orange juice.\n\nWe want the orange juice to be 60% of the new mixture. So, mathematically, that should be:\n\n(0.4 + x) = 0.6 * (1 + x)\n\nI think that's the equation I need to solve.

Subtract 0.6x from both sides:\n\n0.4 + x - 0.6x = 0.6\n\nWhich simplifies to 0.4 + 0.4x = 0.6.\n\nThen, subtract 0.4 from both sides:\n\n0.4x = 0.6 - 0.4 \u2192 0.4x = 0.2.\n\nSo x = 0.2 / 0.4 \u2192 x = 0.5.\n\nWait, so x is 0.5 gallons.

The water is 0.6 gallons, which will now be 40% of the new mixture because OJ is 60%.\n\nWait, because if OJ is 60%, then water is 40%. So 0.6 gallons of water should be 40% of the total. Let me see:\n\n0.6 = 0.4 * total.\n\nTotal = 0.6 / 0.4 \u2192 1.5 gallons. So the new total is 1.5 gallons. The original was 1 gallon, so we added 0.5 gallons.\n\nYes, that's consistent.

The goal is for orange juice to make up 60% of the total volume, leading to the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{0.4 + x}{1 + x} = 0.6\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\( 1 + x \\) to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n0.4 + x = 0.6(1 + x)\n\\]\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n\\[\n0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x\n\\]\n\nSubtracting \\( 0.6x \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n0.4 + 0.4x = 0.6\n\\]\n\nSubtracting \\( 0.4 \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n0.4x = 0.2\n\\]\n\nDividing through by \\( 0.4 \\):\n\n\\[\nx = 0.5\n\\]\n\nThus, adding \\( 0.5 \\) gallons of orange juice results in a total of \\( 0.9 \\) gallons of orange juice and \\( 1.5 \\) gallons of total soft drink.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about mixing soft drinks. Hmm, let's see. The question is about figuring out how much additional orange juice needs to be added to a gallon of soft drink to make the orange juice 60% of the mixture. \n\nWait, the initial mixture is one gallon, right? And it's 40% orange juice and 60% water. So in that gallon, the amount of orange juice is 40% of one gallon. Let me calculate that. 40% is like 0.4 in decimal, so 0.4 * 1 gallon = 0.4 gallons of orange juice. And the rest, 0.6 gallons, is water.\n\nThe problem asks how much additional orange juice should be mixed in so that the orange juice becomes 60% of the new soft drink. Oh, right, because when we add more orange juice, the total volume increases, but the water stays the same since we're only adding orange juice.\n\nSo let's think about variables. Let's say x is the amount of orange juice we need to add. After adding x gallons of orange juice, the total amount of orange juice becomes 0.4 + x gallons. The total volume of the soft drink becomes 1 + x gallons because we're adding x gallons to the original one gallon.\n\nWe want the orange juice to make up 60% of the new mixture. So the equation should be:\n\n(0.4 + x) / (1 + x) = 0.6\n\nI think that's right. Let me solve for x.\n\nMultiply both sides by (1 + x):\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6*(1 + x)\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x\n\nHmm, now subtract 0.6x from both sides:\n\n0.4 + x - 0.6x = 0.6\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n0.4 + 0.4x = 0.6\n\nSubtract 0.4 from both sides:\n\n0.4x = 0.2\n\nDivide both sides by 0.4:\n\nx = 0.2 / 0.4 = 0.5\n\nWait, that gives x as 0.5 gallons. So adding half a gallon of orange juice would make the orange juice 60% of the mixture.\n\nLet me double-check. The original is 0.4 gallons OJ, 0.6 water. Adding 0.5 OJ makes it 0.9 OJ and 0.6 water. Total volume is 1.5 gallons. 0.9 / 1.5 is indeed 0.6, which is 60%. So that makes sense.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 0.5. So the answer should be A.\n",

This leads to the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{0.4 + x}{1 + x} = 0.6\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\( 1 + x \\) to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n0.4 + x = 0.6(1 + x)\n\\]\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n\\[\n0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x\n\\]\n\nSubtracting \\( 0.6x \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n0.4 + 0.4x = 0.6\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 0.4 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n0.4x = 0.2\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 0.4:\n\n\\[\nx = 0.5\n\\]\n\nThus, 0.5 gallons of orange juice must be added. Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:\n\n**A) 0.5**\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, so the question is about mixing soft drinks. I'm a bit rusty on mixture problems, but I think I can figure this out. Let me read the question again.\n\nSo, we have one gallon of soft drink that's 40% orange juice and 60% water. We need to find out how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in so that the orange juice becomes 60% of the soft drink.\n\nWait, so initially, the mixture is 1 gallon. 40% is orange juice, so that's 0.4 gallons of OJ and 0.6 gallons of water. Got it. Now, we're adding more orange juice. Let's call the amount of OJ we add 'x' gallons. The question is asking for x, right?\n\nAfter adding x gallons of OJ, the total volume of the soft drink becomes 1 + x gallons. Because when you mix x gallons of OJ into the existing 1 gallon, the total increases. So the new total is 1 + x.\n\nNow, the amount of OJ in the mixture will be the original 0.4 gallons plus the x gallons we added. So OJ becomes 0.4 + x gallons.\n\nWe want this OJ to make up 60% of the total mixture. So, 0.4 + x should equal 60% of (1 + x). Let me write that as an equation:\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6 * (1 + x)\n\nOkay, let's solve this equation step by step. First, expand the right-hand side:\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6 * 1 + 0.6 * x\n0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x\n\nNow, I want to get all the x terms on one side and the constants on the other. Let's subtract 0.6x from both sides:\n\n0.4 + x - 0.6x = 0.6\n0.4 + 0.4x = 0.6\n\nWait, let me check that. Subtract 0.6x from x gives 0.4x, right. And 0.4 remains on the left.\n\nNow, subtract 0.4 from both sides:\n\n0.4x = 0.6 - 0.4\n0.4x = 0.2\n\nHmm, then x is 0.2 divided by 0.4. Let me calculate that. 0.2 / 0.4 equals 0.5. So x is 0.5 gallons. So we need to add half a gallon of orange juice.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's plug x=0.5 back into the original setup. The initial OJ is 0.4 gallons. Adding 0.5 gives 0.9 gallons OJ. The total mixture is 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 gallons. So 0.9 divided by 1.5 is 0.6, which is 60%. Yep, that works.\n\nSo the answer should be 0.5 gallons. Looking at the options, option A is 0.5. So the correct answer is A.\n",
