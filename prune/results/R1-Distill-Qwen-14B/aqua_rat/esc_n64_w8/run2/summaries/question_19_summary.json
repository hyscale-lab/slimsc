      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about averages in a class. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit confused, but I'll think it through.\n\nThe problem says that the average of the highest and lowest scores is x. So, if I remember correctly, the average of two numbers is just the sum divided by two. So, if the highest score is H and the lowest is L, then (H + L)/2 = x. That means H + L = 2x. Got that.\n\nNext, the average score for the entire class is y. There are z students. So, the total sum of all the scores is average multiplied by the number of students. So, total sum = y * z. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the average score when we exclude the highest and lowest scorers. So, we're removing two students, right? So, the number of students left is z - 2. And the average for these remaining students is what we're looking for.\n\nLet me think about how to find this average. The formula for average is (sum of scores) divided by (number of scores). So, if I can find the sum of the scores excluding H and L, then divide by (z-2), that should give me the answer.\n\nThe total sum including H and L is y*z. So, the sum without H and L would be total sum minus H minus L. Which is y*z - H - L. But wait, earlier I found that H + L = 2x. So, I can substitute that in. So, the new sum is y*z - (2x).\n\nSo, the sum of the remaining (z-2) students is (y*z - 2x). Then, the average is (y*z - 2x) divided by (z-2). So, that would be (y*z - 2x)/(z-2).\n\nLooking at the options, option D is (zy - 2x)/(z-2), which matches what I have. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: the original average is y. So, the total is y*z. Removing H and L, which add up to 2x, so the new total is y*z - 2x. Then, the new average is (y*z - 2x)/(z-2). Yep, that's exactly option D.\n\nI think that's right. So the answer should be D.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about averages and exams. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nThe problem says: There's an exam in a class. The average of the highest score and the lowest score is x. The average for the entire class is y, and there are z students, with z being more than 5. We need to find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers, expressed in terms of x, y, and z.\n\nHmm, let's think about averages. I remember that the average is the total sum divided by the number of elements. So, the average score for the entire class is y. Since there are z students, the total sum of all their scores is z multiplied by y. So, total sum = z*y.\n\nNow, the average of the highest and lowest scores is x. That means (highest + lowest)/2 = x. So, highest + lowest = 2x. Let me note that down: H + L = 2x.\n\nWe are asked to find the average when we exclude the highest and lowest. So, that would be the total sum of all scores except H and L, divided by (z - 2) students.\n\nLet me compute the sum of the remaining scores. The total sum is z*y, and we subtract H and L. So, sum_excluding = z*y - H - L. But H + L is 2x, so sum_excluding = zy - 2x.\n\nThen, the average for the remaining students is (zy - 2x) divided by (z - 2). So, average = (zy - 2x)/(z - 2).\n\nWait, looking at the options, option D is (zy - 2x)/(z-2), which matches. Let me double-check the other options to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nOption A: (zy - 2x)/z. That would be the same as y - (2x/z), but I don't think that's right because we're excluding two students, not just subtracting something from y.\n\nOption B: (zy - 2)/z. No, that seems off because the 2 is not multiplied by x. That doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nOption C: (zx - y)/(z-2). Hmm, let's see. If I rearrange, zx - y would be x*z - y. But our sum is zy - 2x, so that's not the same. So, probably not C.\n\nOption D: (zy - 2x)/(z-2). That's exactly what I derived, so that's a strong candidate.\n\nOption E: (zy - x)/(z+2). The denominator is z+2, but since we're excluding two people, it should be z-2, so E is probably incorrect.\n\nSo, I think D is the correct answer.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about averages and exams. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nThe problem says: There's an exam in a class. The average of the highest score and the lowest score is x. The average for the entire class is y, and there are z students, with z being more than 5. We need to find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers, expressed in terms of x, y, and z.\n\nHmm, let's think about averages. I remember that the average is the total sum divided by the number of elements. So, the average score for the entire class is y. Since there are z students, the total sum of all their scores is z multiplied by y. So, total sum = z*y.\n\nNow, the average of the highest and lowest scores is x. That means (highest + lowest)/2 = x. So, highest + lowest = 2x. Let me note that down: H + L = 2x.\n\nWe are asked to find the average when we exclude the highest and lowest. So, that would be the total sum of all scores except H and L, divided by (z - 2) students.\n\nLet me compute the sum of the remaining scores. The total sum is z*y, and we subtract H and L. So, sum_excluding = z*y - H - L. But H + L is 2x, so sum_excluding = zy - 2x.\n\nThen, the average for the remaining students is (zy - 2x) divided by (z - 2). So, average = (zy - 2x)/(z - 2).\n\nWait, looking at the options, option D is (zy - 2x)/(z-2), which matches. Let me double-check the other options to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nOption A: (zy - 2x)/z. That would be the same as y - (2x/z), but I don't think that's right because we're excluding two students, not just subtracting something from y.\n\nOption B: (zy - 2)/z. No, that seems off because the 2 is not multiplied by x. That doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nOption C: (zx - y)/(z-2). Hmm, let's see. If I rearrange, zx - y would be x*z - y. But our sum is zy - 2x, so that's not the same. So, probably not C.\n\nOption D: (zy - 2x)/(z-2). That's exactly what I derived, so that's a strong candidate.\n\nOption E: (zy - x)/(z+2).
