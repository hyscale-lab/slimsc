      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Fernando and his university meal plan. Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nAlright, so the problem says that Fernando has a meal plan allowing him 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. The cafeteria is closed on weekends, meaning it's not open on Saturday and Sunday. Also, Fernando always goes home for dinner on Friday nights. Hmm, so that probably affects how he uses his meals.\n\nWait, let's break it down. The week has 7 days, but the cafeteria is closed on weekends, so that's two days. So, the days when the cafeteria is open are Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. But wait, on Friday nights, he goes home for dinner, so he doesn't eat at the cafeteria on Friday evening.\n\nSo, for lunch, since he can have 3 per week, but the cafeteria is closed on weekends. Let's think about how many days he can have lunch. The cafeteria is open for lunch on Monday to Friday, right? Because usually, lunch is mid-day, so it's open on those days.\n\nWait, but the problem says the cafeteria is closed on weekends. So, for lunch, how many days are available? From Monday to Friday, that's 5 days. So, he can have lunch on any of those days, but he's limited to 3 lunches.\n\nSo, for lunch, he has to choose 3 days out of the 5 available (Monday-Friday). So the number of ways to choose lunch days is 5 choose 3, which is written as 5C3.\n\nNow, for dinners. He has 3 dinners allowed per week. But wait, the cafeteria is closed on weekends, so he can't have dinner on Saturday or Sunday. Also, he goes home on Friday nights, meaning he doesn't have dinner at the cafeteria on Friday.\n\nSo, the days when the cafeteria is open for dinner are Monday to Thursday, because Friday is closed for dinner (he goes home). So that's 4 days available for dinners: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.\n\nHe needs to choose 3 dinners from these 4 days. So, the number of ways is 4 choose 3, which is 4C3.\n\nSo, the total number of options is the product of the two combinations: 5C3 * 4C3.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 5C3 * 4C3. That matches.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Are there any other constraints? For example, can he have multiple meals on the same day? The question says he has a total of 3 lunches and 3 dinners, so each meal is a separate day, I think. Because you can't have two lunches on the same day if you're choosing different days for each.\n\nSo, yes, 5C3 for lunch days and 4C3 for dinner days. So the correct answer is option A.\n",

Let me read it again.\n\nFernando has a meal plan with 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. The cafeteria is closed on weekends. He always goes home for dinner on Fridays. I need to figure out how many options he has to allocate his meals. The options are given as combinations.\n\nHmm. So, the key points are: 3 lunches and 3 dinners. The cafeteria is closed on weekends, which I guess means he can't eat there on Saturday or Sunday. But he goes home for dinner on Friday. So, he must eat dinner at home on Friday.\n\nWait, the question is about allocating his meals. So he has a certain number of meals (lunches and dinners) that he can use each week, and the days he can use them are limited because the cafeteria is closed on weekends.\n\nLet me think about the days of the week. Normally, a week has 7 days: Monday to Sunday. But since the cafeteria is closed on weekends, that's Saturday and Sunday. So, the days when the cafeteria is open are Monday to Friday.\n\nHe has 3 lunches and 3 dinners. He can't use the cafeteria on weekends, so he must use his meal allocations only on Monday to Friday.\n\nBut wait, he goes home for dinner on Friday. So, that means on Friday, he's not having dinner at the cafeteria. So, he can't use one of his dinner meals on Friday. Hmm, so how does that affect the number of dinner meals he uses at the cafeteria?\n\nWait, the meal plan allows him 3 dinners, but he's using one at home on Friday. So, the remaining two dinners must be used on the other days when the cafeteria is open. So, he has 2 dinners to allocate over Monday to Thursday (since Friday he's home).\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. The meal plan gives him 3 dinners in total. Since he goes home on Friday, he can't use one of those at the cafeteria. So, the 3 dinners are: he uses two at the cafeteria (Monday-Friday except Friday) and one at home on Friday.\n\nWait, but wait. The problem says he goes home for dinner on Friday nights. So, he's not using the meal plan for that dinner. So, his 3 dinners must be used on the other days when the cafeteria is open, which are Monday to Thursday (since Friday's dinner is at home) and the other days (Monday-Friday, but Friday's dinner is off the plan). So, the 3 dinners are used on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. But wait, that's four days. He has three dinners to allocate over these four days. Oh, so he can't use all four days for dinners because he only has three meals.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The problem says he can have a total of 3 dinners. He goes home on Friday, so he can't use the cafeteria on Friday. So, the possible days for using the dinner meals are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. That's four days.\n\nSo, he has 3 dinners to allocate among these four days. So, the number of ways to choose 3 days out of 4 for dinners. That's a combination problem, 4 choose 3, which is 4C3.\n\nSimilarly, for lunches, he has 3 lunches to allocate. The cafeteria is open Monday to Friday, which is five days. So, he can use any of these five days for his three lunches. So, the number of ways is 5 choose 3, which is 5C3.\n\nWait, but wait. Are there any constraints on when he can have his meals? Like, does he have to have at least one lunch or dinner each day? The problem doesn't say anything about that, so I think each meal can be on any day, possibly multiple on the same day, but the problem is about the allocation, not the specific times.\n\nWait no, the problem is about how many ways he can allocate the meals, not the specific times. So, it's a matter of choosing days for each meal.\n\nSo, for the dinners: he can choose any 3 days out of Monday to Thursday (since Friday is excluded for dinner). So, that's 4 days, choose 3: 4C3.\n\nFor lunches: 5 days (Mon-Fri), choose 3: 5C3.\n\nSo the total number of options is 5C3 multiplied by 4C3.\n\nWait, looking at the options, option A is 5C3 * 4C3. So, that would be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me check all the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA)5C3*4C3\nB)5C4*4C2\nC)5C2*4C4\nD)5C6*4C5\nE)4C3*4C3\n\nSo, the correct calculation is 5 choose 3 times 4 choose 3, which is option A.\n\nWait, but wait a moment. Does the problem require that he uses all his meals? The problem says he has a meal plan that allows him to have 3 lunches and 3 dinners. So, he must use all of them. So, he must choose exactly 3 days for lunch and exactly 3 days for dinner, but with the constraint on dinner that Friday is not used.\n\nWait, another way: For lunch, he has 5 days (Mon-Fri) to choose 3 days (each day he can have one lunch, perhaps multiple, but the problem doesn't specify that he can't have multiple on the same day. Wait, but the way the question is phrased, I think it's assuming he can have only one meal per day, because otherwise, the combinations would be different.\n\nWait, actually, the problem says \"allocate his meals.\" So, each meal is a single lunch or dinner. So, each day he can have at most one lunch and/or one dinner. But he has 3 lunches and 3 dinners to assign to days, with the constraints.\n\nSo, for lunch: he has 5 days (Mon-Fri), choose 3 days to have lunch.\n\nFor dinner: 4 days (Mon-Thu), choose 3 days to have dinner.\n\nSo the number of options is 5C3 * 4C3, which is option A.\n",

Oh, right, he can't use the meal plan on weekends for either lunch or dinner. But since he's only allowed 3 of each, and the maximum days available are five for lunch and four for dinner, I think the calculation holds.\n\nSo yes, the calculation is 5C3 for lunch and 4C3 for dinner. So the total is 5C3 * 4C3, which is option A.\n\n\nFernando has a meal plan that allows him 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. The cafeteria is closed on weekends, meaning it is only open from Monday to Friday (5 days). Additionally, Fernando goes home for dinner on Friday nights, so he cannot use his dinner meal plan on Friday. \n\nFor lunches, Fernando can use his meal plan on any of the 5 days the cafeteria is open (Monday to Friday). Therefore, he needs to choose 3 days out of these 5, which corresponds to \\(5 \\text{C} 3\\).\n\nFor dinners, Fernando can only use his meal plan on Monday to Thursday (4 days) since he goes home on Friday. Thus, he needs to choose 3 days out of these 4, which corresponds to \\(4 \\text{C} 3\\).\n\nThe total number of options Fernando has to allocate his meals is the product of these two combinations: \\(5 \\text{C} 3 \\times 4 \\text{C} 3\\). This matches option A.\n\nAnswer: A",

The cafeteria is closed on weekends, so he can't eat there on Saturday and Sunday. He always goes home for dinner on Friday nights. I need to find out how many options he has to allocate his meals.\n\nHmm. So, let's break it down. The week has 7 days, but the cafeteria is closed on weekends. So, the days he can eat at the cafeteria are Monday to Friday for lunch and dinners except Friday dinner, since he goes home.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. He has 3 lunches and 3 dinners. The cafeteria is closed on weekends, which are Saturday and Sunday. So, he can only eat at the cafeteria on Monday to Friday for both lunch and dinner. But on Friday night, he goes home for dinner, so he doesn't eat at the cafeteria that day.\n\nSo, for lunches: He can eat at the cafeteria on Monday to Friday. That's 5 days. He needs to choose 3 days for lunch. So that's choosing 3 out of 5 days.\n\nFor dinners: He can eat at the cafeteria on Monday to Thursday and Friday. Wait, no. Because on Friday night, he goes home, so the only dinners he can have at the cafeteria are Monday to Thursday. Wait, wait, that might not be correct.\n\nWait, the problem says he goes home for dinner on Friday nights. So, on Friday, he has dinner at home, not at the cafeteria. So, the only days he can have dinner at the cafeteria are Monday to Thursday. That's 4 days. But wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, the meal plan allows for 3 dinners. But he has to use them during the days the cafeteria is open for dinner. The cafeteria is closed on weekends, so on Saturday and Sunday, he can't eat there. So for dinners, the available days are Monday to Friday. But wait, he goes home on Friday night. So, the available days for dinner at the cafeteria are Monday to Thursday, which is 4 days. But does he have Friday dinner at the cafeteria? No, because he goes home. So he can't use Friday for dinner.\n\nWait, but the problem says he always goes home for dinner on Friday nights. So, Friday's dinner is at home. So, for his 3 dinner meals, he can only use the days when the cafeteria is open and he's not at home. So, Monday to Thursday for dinner. That's four days.\n\nSo, for dinners, he needs to choose 3 days out of these 4 (Mon-Thu). So the number of ways is combination of 4 choose 3.\n\nFor lunches, he can go to the cafeteria on Monday to Friday. That's 5 days. He needs to choose 3 days for lunch. So that's 5 choose 3.\n\nWait, so the total options are the product of the two combinations: 5C3 * 4C3.\n\nLet me look at the options. Option A is 5C3 *4C3. That's what I came up with.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nLunches: 3 meals. Days available: Monday-Friday (5 days). So 5C3.\n\nDinners: 3 meals. Days available: Monday-Thursday (4 days, because Friday dinner is at home). So 4C3.\n\nMultiply them together because for each lunch choice, there are multiple dinner choices.

The cafeteria is closed on weekends, which means it's closed on Saturday and Sunday. Also, Fernando always goes home for dinner on Friday nights. So I need to figure out how this affects his meal options.\n\nWait, let's break this down. The week has seven days, but the cafeteria is closed on weekends\u2014so that's two days closed. So from Monday to Friday, the cafeteria is open. That's five days where he can get his meals.\n\nHe has 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. But wait, he goes home for dinner on Friday. So that means he doesn't eat dinner at the cafeteria on Friday, right? So for dinners, he can only use the cafeteria on Monday to Thursday, which is four days.\n\nSo for lunches, since the cafeteria is open Monday to Friday (five days), he can choose any three of those five days to have lunch. So the number of ways to choose lunch days is 5 choose 3, which is written as 5C3.\n\nFor dinners, since he doesn't eat on Friday, he has only four days (Mon-Thu) to choose his three dinners.

So that's 4 choose 3.\n\nSo the total number of options is the product of these two combinations: (5 choose 3) multiplied by (4 choose 3). Let me look at the options.\n\nOption A is 5C3 *4C3. That matches what I just thought. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says he goes home for dinner on Friday. So he can't use the dinner meal on Friday. So for dinner, he can only choose from four days. And he has three dinners to allocate. So 4C3.\n\nAnd for lunch, he can use any of the five days, because the problem doesn't restrict him from using Friday for lunch. So 5C3.\n\nSo the total is 5C3 multiplied by 4C3, which is option A.\n\n\nFernando has a meal plan that allows him 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. The cafeteria is closed on weekends, so it is only open from Monday to Friday. Additionally, he goes home for dinner on Friday nights, meaning he cannot use his dinner meal plan on Friday. \n\nFor lunches, he can choose any 3 days out of the 5 available days (Monday to Friday), which corresponds to the combination \\( 5C3 \\). For dinners, he can only choose 3 days out of the 4 available days (Monday to Thursday), corresponding to \\( 4C3 \\). The total number of options is the product of these two combinations: \\( 5C3 \\times 4C3 \\).\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about Fernando's meal plan and how he can allocate his meals. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on combinatorics, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nAlright, let's read the problem again. Fernando has a meal plan that allows him 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. The cafeteria is closed on weekends, which probably means he can't use his meal plan on Saturday and Sunday. Also, it's stated that he always goes home for dinner on Friday nights. So, he must have dinner at home every Friday.\n\nWait, so the week has seven days, but the cafeteria is closed on weekends. That leaves Monday to Friday as the days when the cafeteria is open. So, each day from Monday to Friday, he can choose to have lunch and/or dinner there. But wait, wait. Wait, the meal plan allows 3 lunches and 3 dinners. So, he can use each of these meals on any of the open days.\n\nBut wait, he goes home for dinner on Friday. So, on Friday night, he's not using his dinner meal at the cafeteria. So, that means he can't use one of his three dinner meals on Friday. Therefore, he has to allocate the three dinners to the other days: Monday to Thursday, and maybe Friday? Wait, no. Because on Friday, he's not using the dinner meal. So, he can't have a dinner at the cafeteria on Friday. So, the three dinners must be used on Monday to Thursday.\n\nWait, that's an important point. So, the three dinner meals can't be used on Friday because he's going home. So, he has four days for dinners: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Because Friday is out. So, he needs to distribute three dinners across these four days.\n\nSimilarly, for lunches, the cafeteria is open Monday to Friday. So, five days. He has three lunch meals to allocate across these five days.\n\nWait, so each meal (lunch and dinner) is a separate allocation. So, the total number of options is the product of the number of ways he can allocate his lunches and the number of ways he can allocate his dinners.\n\nSo, for the lunches: he has 5 days (Mon-Fri) and needs to choose 3 days to have lunch. So, that's a combination problem. The number of ways is 5 choose 3, which is 5C3.\n\nFor the dinners: he has 4 days (Mon-Thu) because Friday is excluded. He needs to choose 3 days to have dinner. So, that's 4 choose 3, which is 4C3.\n\nTherefore, the total number of options is 5C3 multiplied by 4C3. Let me check the options:\n\nOption A is 5C3 *4C3. That's what I have. Option E is 4C3 *4C3, which doesn't seem right because the lunch days are 5.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Does he have to have lunch and dinner on the same day? Or can they be on different days? The problem doesn't specify that he must eat both meals on the same day. So, he can have lunch on any day, and dinner on any other day, as long as he doesn't exceed the number of meals.\n\nWait, but the problem says he has 3 lunches and 3 dinners. So, he can have a lunch on a day without having a dinner that day, or vice versa. So, the allocations for lunch and dinner are independent. So, the initial approach is correct: 5C3 for lunch, 4C3 for dinner. So, the total is 5C3 *4C3, which is option A.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me think again. The problem says he can have a total of 3 lunches and 3 dinners. So, he's going to use each of those meals on any of the available days, with the constraints on Friday dinner.\n\nSo, for lunch, any of the 5 days (Mon-Fri). So, 5C3.\n\nFor dinner, any of the 4 days (Mon-Thu). So, 4C3.\n\nSo, the total is 5C3 *4C3. So, option A.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the correct answer should be option A.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about Fernando's meal plan, and I need to figure out how many options he has to allocate his meals. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says that Fernando bought a meal plan with 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. But wait, the cafeteria is closed on weekends. Oh right, so he can't go there on Saturday and Sunday. So I guess that means he doesn't have any meals on those days, but the problem is about his meal allocations for the days when it's open.\n\nFernando always goes home for dinner on Friday nights. Hmm, so on Friday, he's not eating dinner at the cafeteria. That must mean he's using one of his dinner meal allowances at home. So how does that affect his meal plan usage?\n\nLet me think about the days the cafeteria is open. Since it's closed on weekends, that leaves Monday to Friday. So five days in total. But wait, the problem says he goes home for dinner on Friday. So on Friday, he uses a dinner at home, which counts towards his 3 dinners per week.\n\nSo the meals he can get from the cafeteria are for the other days. Let me figure out how many days he's using each meal type.\n\nFor lunches: He can have them Monday to Friday. So five days, but he's only allowed 3 lunches. So he needs to choose 3 days out of those five to have lunch at the cafeteria.\n\nFor dinners: Normally, he could have dinners on five days, but he's not using the cafeteria on Friday. So he can only have dinners from Monday to Thursday, which is four days. Plus, he uses one of his dinner meals at home on Friday. So his dinners at the cafeteria have to be 3 meals, but he can only choose from four days (Monday to Thursday). Wait, wait, no. Wait, the total dinners he has are 3. But since he's using one at home on Friday, that means he needs to have the other two dinners at the cafeteria. Because his meal plan is 3 dinners total. Oh wait, no, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the meal plan allows for 3 dinners per week. But since he's using one of them at home on Friday, that means he has 2 dinners left to use at the cafeteria during the week. Because 3 total dinners minus 1 at home equals 2 dinners at the cafeteria.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because the problem says he has 3 dinners per week, but he uses one at home on Friday. So the other two can be used on the remaining days. But wait, how many days are available for dinners at the cafeteria?\n\nCafeteria is open Monday to Friday, but on Friday he's not using it for dinner. So the available days for dinners are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday\u2014four days. So he can have dinners on four days, but his meal plan allows only 3 dinners. Wait, no. He has 3 dinners in total. Since he uses one at home on Friday, that leaves two dinners to be used on the other four days (Monday-Thursday). So he needs to choose two days out of those four to have his dinners at the cafeteria.\n\nWait, but wait, no. Let me clarify. The meal plan gives him 3 dinners each week. He uses one of those on Friday at home, so he has 2 left to use during the week. The days when the cafeteria is open and he can use those are Monday to Thursday. So he needs to choose two days from those four to have dinners. So that's 4 choose 2.\n\nAnd for lunches, he can have up to 3 each week, and he can choose any three days from the five days (Monday-Friday). Because the cafeteria is open all those days, and he's not restricted for lunch on Friday. So for lunch, it's 5 choose 3.\n\nSo putting it together, the number of options is the product of these two choices. So 5C3 multiplied by 4C2.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, let's check the choices. Option B is 5C4 * 4C2. Hmm, no, that's not right. Wait, wait, no. Let me make sure I got the numbers right.\n\nWait, for lunches: 5 days, choose 3. So 5C3.\n\nFor dinners: 4 days (Mon-Thu), choose 2. So 4C2.\n\nSo the total options would be 5C3 * 4C2.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 5C4 *4C2. Hmm, that's not matching. Option C is 5C2 *4C4. Option A is 5C3 *4C3. Hmm, none of the options have 5C3 *4C2.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake in the dinner calculation? Let me think again.\n\nWait, he has 3 dinners. He uses one at home on Friday. So the other two are used on the other days when the cafeteria is open for dinner. The cafeteria is open Monday to Friday. So the days available for dinner at the cafeteria are Monday to Thursday, which is four days. So he needs to choose two days from these four to use his two remaining dinners.\n\nSo that's 4C2. So for dinner, it's 4C2.\n\nBut looking at the options, which option has 5C3 multiplied by 4C2?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)5C3 *4C3 \u2192 No, that would be if he had 3 dinners to allocate from 4 days.\n\nB)5C4 *4C2 \u2192 5C4 is 5 choose 4. That's not the case for lunch.\n\nC)5C2 *4C4 \u2192 4C4 is 1.\n\nD)5C6 *4C5 \u2192 Those are impossible because 5 choose 6 is zero.\n\nE)4C3 *4C3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, none of the options have 5C3 *4C2. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the dinner count. Let me think again.\n\nWait, he has 3 dinners total. He uses one on Friday, so he has two left for the other days. So he needs to choose two days from the four available (Mon-Thu) to have dinners at the cafeteria.\n\nSo for dinner, it's 4C2.\n\nLunch is 5C3.\n\nSo the total number of options is 5C3 * 4C2.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again:\n\nOption B is 5C4 *4C2. So that would be if he was choosing 4 days for lunch. But that's not the case.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is not about choosing days, but about the allocation of the meals. Like, each day he can have a meal, but he can only have a meal if he uses one of his allowances.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is about distributing the meal counts across the days. Oh, perhaps it's a stars and bars problem, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: the number of ways to choose the days he uses lunch and dinner.\n\nHe has 3 lunches and 3 dinners. The cafeteria is open Monday-Friday (5 days). He can't use Friday for dinner, so for dinners, he can only choose from Monday-Thursday (4 days).\n\nSo for lunch, he has to choose 3 days out of 5 (Monday-Friday). For dinner, he has to choose 3 days, but one of them is fixed on Friday, but wait, no: he can't have dinner on Friday at the cafeteria. So he must have his dinners on Monday-Thursday, but he has 3 dinners to allocate. Wait, no, wait: he has 3 dinners in total. He uses one at home on Friday, so the other two must be on the days the cafeteria is open for dinner, which are Monday-Thursday (4 days). So he needs to choose 2 days from those 4 for the other two dinners.\n\nWait, so the dinners at the cafeteria are 2, not 3. So the number of ways for dinner is 4C2.\n\nSo the total options are 5C3 (for lunch) multiplied by 4C2 (for dinner). But looking at the options, I don't see this combination.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the number of dinners. Let's think: the total dinners per week are 3. He goes home on Friday, so he uses one dinner there. So he has 2 dinners left to use during the week at the cafeteria. The days available are Monday-Thursday (4 days). So he needs to choose 2 days out of 4 for these dinners. So 4C2.\n\nSo the total options are (5 choose 3) for lunch and (4 choose 2) for dinner. So 5C3 *4C2.\n\nLooking back at the options, the only option that comes close is option B, which is 5C4 *4C2. But that's not the same as 5C3 *4C2.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nFernando purchased a meal plan that allows him to have a total of 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. The cafeteria is closed on weekends. He goes home for dinner on Friday nights.\n\nSo, he can only eat at the cafeteria on Monday-Friday for lunch. For dinner, he can eat at the cafeteria on Monday-Thursday. On Friday, he doesn't use the cafeteria for dinner.\n\nSo, the problem is about selecting the days he uses his 3 lunches and 3 dinners.\n\nWait, but he can't use Friday for dinner, so he can't have a dinner on Friday at the cafeteria. So the 3 dinners must be allocated across the other days. Wait, no. He has 3 dinners per week. He uses one at home on Friday, so he has 2 left to use on Monday-Thursday.\n\nWait, no, that's 3 dinners in total. He uses one at home, so the other two must be on the days when the cafeteria is open for dinner (Monday-Thursday). So he needs to choose 2 days out of the 4 for his dinners.\n\nSo lunch: 5 days (Mon-Fri) choose 3.\n\nDinner: 4 days (Mon-Thu) choose 2.\n\nSo the total options are 5C3 *4C2.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nA)5C3*4C3 \u2192 4C3 is 4, so 5C3 *4 \u2192 but I need 4C2.\n\nB)5C4*4C2 \u2192 5C4 is 5, so 5 *6=30. But my calculation is 10 *6=60.\n\nC)5C2 *4C4 \u2192 10*1=10.\n\nD)5C6*4C5 \u2192 impossible, since you can't choose 6 from 5.\n\nE)4C3 *4C3 \u2192 4*4=16.\n\nHmm, none of the options match my calculation of 5C3 *4C2 = 10 *6=60.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the dinner calculation. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that he can't use Friday for dinner, so the 3 dinners must be spread over the other days. Wait, but he uses one dinner at home on Friday, so the other two dinners must be on the other days when the cafeteria is open.\n\nWait, but the meal plan allows 3 dinners, and he uses one at home. So the other two are used on the four days (Mon-Thu). So choosing 2 days from 4 for those.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is considering that the dinners must be on the days when the cafeteria is open, so for dinner, he can only use four days (Mon-Thu). So he has to choose 3 dinners from these four days. But wait, he can't, because he's already using one dinner at home on Friday. So he can't use the three dinners on the four days because he has only two left.\n\nWait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach.\n\nEach day, he can have a lunch and/or dinner. But the problem is about how he allocates his 3 lunches and 3 dinners across the days the cafeteria is open.\n\nWait, but the problem is about choosing which days he uses his meal plan for lunch and dinner, given that the cafeteria is closed on weekends.\n\nSo for lunch:\n\nHe can choose any of the 5 days (Mon-Fri) to use his 3 lunches. So 5C3.\n\nFor dinner:\n\nHe can't use Friday, so he can choose any of the 4 days (Mon-Thu) for his 3 dinners. Wait, but he has only 3 dinners, but the days available are 4. So he needs to choose 3 days from 4. So 4C3.\n\nWait, but wait, no. Because he uses one dinner at home on Friday, so the other two dinners are on the other four days. So the number of dinners at the cafeteria is 2, so 4C2.\n\nWait, now I'm getting conflicting conclusions. So which is correct?\n\nAh, perhaps the confusion comes from whether the 3 dinners include the Friday dinner at home. Let me clarify:\n\nThe meal plan allows 3 dinners per week. He uses one of them at home on Friday, so the other two must be used on the other days when the cafeteria is open (Mon-Thu). So he has to choose two days out of four for his dinners. So 4C2.\n\nSo total options are 5C3 *4C2.\n\nBut none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that he can use the same day for both lunch and dinner. So perhaps the allocation is about choosing days for each meal, but considering that a day can have both a lunch and a dinner.\n\nWait, but the problem says he has 3 lunches and 3 dinners, but the days when he can have them are Monday to Friday. So perhaps the problem is about assigning each meal to a day, with the constraints that he can't have more than one lunch per day and more than one dinner per day, but each day can have both a lunch and a dinner.\n\nWait, that might complicate things. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a matter of distributing the 3 lunches and 3 dinners across the available days, considering that Friday cannot have a dinner.\n\nHmm, so for lunch, each of the 3 can be any of the 5 days. For dinner, each of the 3 can be any of the 4 days (Mon-Thu). But this seems like a stars and bars problem, but with the constraint that no day has more than one lunch or dinner.\n\nWait, but no, because the problem is about choosing days, not the order. So each day can have at most one lunch and one dinner, but he can have both on the same day.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model this as choosing 3 days out of 5 for lunch and 3 days out of 4 for dinner. But since each day can have both a lunch and a dinner, perhaps some days are used for both.\n\nWait, but the problem is about how he allocates his meals. So the number of options would be the product of the number of ways to choose the days for lunch and the days for dinner, considering the constraints.\n\nSo for lunch, it's 5C3. For dinner, it's 4C3 (since he can't have Friday). So the total number of options is 5C3 *4C3.\n\nWait, that would be option A: 5C3 *4C3.\n\nBut earlier I thought that he only uses two dinners on the four days because he uses one at home. So which is correct?\n\nAh, here's the confusion. The meal plan gives him 3 dinners per week. He can use them any way he wants, but he must use one at home on Friday. So he has two dinners left to use on the other days.\n\nSo for dinner, he can choose 2 days from the four available (Mon-Thu). So 4C2.\n\nSo the total is 5C3 *4C2.\n\nBut since none of the options have that, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nThe meal plan allows 3 dinners each week. He must use one of them on Friday at home. So the other two dinners must be used on the other days when the cafeteria is open (Mon-Thu). So he needs to choose two days from four.\n\nSo 4C2.\n\nFor lunch, he can choose any three days from five.\n\nSo 5C3 *4C2.\n\nBut looking at the options again, the only option that has 5C3 is option A (5C3 *4C3) and option C (5C2 *4C4).\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is option A. But why? Maybe I'm making a mistake in the dinner calculation.\n\nAlternative approach: The 3 dinners can be used any day except Friday. So the days available are four (Mon-Thu). So he can choose any three days from those four. So 4C3.\n\nThen the total is 5C3 *4C3, which is option A.\n\nBut why would that be the case? Because he has 3 dinners to allocate, each on a different day, and can't use Friday. So choosing 3 days from 4, which is 4C3.\n\nWait, but he has 3 dinners and each dinner is a separate day. So he must pick three different days for his dinners, each of which can be any of the four days (Mon-Thu). So 4C3.\n\nAh, that makes sense. So for dinner, he's choosing 3 days from 4, each day having one dinner. So 4C3.\n\nAnd for lunch, he's choosing 3 days from 5, so 5C3.\n\nSo the total options are 5C3 *4C3, which is option A.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that he uses only two dinners at the cafeteria, but that's incorrect. Because the meal plan allows 3 dinners. He uses one at home on Friday, but the other two are at the cafeteria. No, wait, that's not correct. He has 3 dinners in total. One is used at home, so the other two must be used on the other days when the cafeteria is open. So the other two dinners are at the cafeteria, which are spread over the four days (Mon-Thu). So he needs to choose two days from four.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me think again.\n\nThe meal plan provides 3 dinners. He uses one at home on Friday. So he must use the other two at the cafeteria on other days. So for the two remaining dinners, he has to choose two days from the four (Mon-Thu). So 4C2.\n\nSo the total is 5C3 *4C2.\n\nBut this combination isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that he can't have more than one dinner per day.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem allows for multiple dinners on the same day. But that doesn't make sense because he can't eat more than one dinner in a day. So each dinner must be on a different day.\n\nAh, so each dinner is on a different day. So he has 3 dinners, each on a separate day. One is on Friday at home, and the other two are on two different days from Monday-Thursday. So he has to choose two days from four for his two other dinners. So 4C2.\n\nSo the total is 5C3 (lunch) *4C2 (dinner) = 10 *6=60.\n\nBut looking at the options, none have this product. So perhaps the correct approach is that for dinners, he needs to choose three days, but Friday is not available, so he has to choose three days from the four available days (Mon-Thu) for his dinners at the cafeteria. But that would mean he uses three dinners at the cafeteria, which can't be because his meal plan allows 3 dinners, and he's using one at home. So that's impossible.\n\nWait, no. If he uses three dinners at the cafeteria, that would mean he's using all three, but he has to use one at home. So that's not possible.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is that he must choose 3 days for dinner, but one of them is Friday. But he can't have dinner on Friday at the cafeteria. So that can't be.\n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think differently.\n\nThe problem is about how many ways he can allocate his 3 lunches and 3 dinners across the available days, considering the constraints.\n\nFor lunch, he can choose any of the 5 days (Mon-Fri) to have his 3 lunches. So 5C3.\n\nFor dinner, he can't choose Friday. So he has to choose 3 days from the other four (Mon-Thu). So 4C3.\n\nSo the total number of options is 5C3 *4C3 = 10 *4 =40.\n\nWhich is option A.\n\nBut why? Because he's choosing 3 days for dinner from the four available, even though he's using one dinner at home. Wait, no, because he's using one dinner at home, so he must have two dinners at the cafeteria. So why would he choose 3 days for dinner?\n\nAh, perhaps I'm mixing up the counts. Let me clarify:\n\nHe has 3 dinners to allocate. He uses one at home on Friday, so he has two dinners left to use on the other days. So he needs to choose two days from the four available (Mon-Thu) for his two dinners. So 4C2.\n\nSo the total is 5C3 *4C2.\n\nBut none of the options match this. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, which is 5C3 *4C3, but I'm not sure why.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is that he has 3 dinners, but can choose any day except Friday for them, and each dinner must be on a different day. So he must choose 3 days from the four available (Mon-Thu). So 4C3.\n\nSo that would make the total options 5C3 *4C3.\n\nBut why would he have to choose 3 days for dinner when he only has two dinners left?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nHe has 3 dinners. He must use one on Friday at home. So that's one dinner. The other two must be used on two different days when the cafeteria is open for dinner (Mon-Thu). So he chooses two days from four, each getting one dinner. So 4C2.\n\nSo the total is 5C3 (lunch) *4C2 (dinner).\n\nBut none of the options have that. So perhaps the problem is that he's allowed to have up to three dinners at the cafeteria, but he's using one at home, so he's using two at the cafeteria.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the meal plan allows for 3 dinners. So he can use up to three dinners at the cafeteria, but he's using one at home. So the number of dinners he uses at the cafeteria is 2, and they must be on two different days.\n\nSo 4C2.\n\nThus, the total is 5C3 *4C2.\n\nBut since that's not an option, perhaps the correct approach is to choose 3 days for dinner from the four available, but that would require using three dinners at the cafeteria, which is impossible because he can only use two.\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer is option A:5C3 *4C3, but I'm not confident.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that for dinner, he's allowed 3 dinners, but he can choose any of the four days (Mon-Thu), not necessarily using all three. So he can choose any number of dinners up to three, but in this case, he must use exactly two at the cafeteria because one is at home.\n\nWait, but that complicates it more. I'm getting stuck.\n\nPerhaps I should look for another approach. Let's think in terms of combinations.\n\nThe number of ways to choose days for lunch is 5C3.\n\nThe number of ways to choose days for dinner is 4C3, since he can't choose Friday.\n\nSo the total is 5C3 *4C3.\n\nWhich is option A.\n\nSo I think the correct answer is option A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nFernando purchased a meal plan that allows him to have 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. The cafeteria is closed on weekends, so it is only open Monday through Friday. Additionally, Fernando always goes home for dinner on Friday nights, meaning he cannot use the cafeteria for dinner on Friday. This affects how he allocates his meals.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Lunch Allocation**:\n   - The cafeteria is open for lunch on Monday through Friday (5 days).\n   - Fernando can choose any 3 days out of these 5 to use his lunch meals.\n   - The number of ways to choose 3 days out of 5 is given by the combination formula:  \n     \\[\n     \\binom{5}{3}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Dinner Allocation**:\n   - The cafeteria is open for dinner on Monday through Thursday (4 days), as Friday is closed for dinner due to Fernando going home.\n   - Fernando has 3 dinners in total, but he uses one at home on Friday. This leaves him with 2 dinners to allocate at the cafeteria.\n   - These 2 dinners must be spread across the 4 available days (Monday through Thursday).\n   - The number of ways to choose 2 days out of these 4 is given by the combination formula:  \n     \\[\n     \\binom{4}{2}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Total Options**:\n   - The total number of ways Fernando can allocate his meals is the product of the two combinations:  \n     \\[\n     \\binom{5}{3} \\times \\binom{4}{2}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Matching with Options**:\n   - Option A: \\(\\binom{5}{3} \\times \\binom{4}{3}\\)  \n     This does not match because \\(\\binom{4}{3}\\) corresponds to choosing 3 days for dinner, which is inconsistent with the problem constraints (Fernando only needs to allocate 2 dinners at the cafeteria).\n   - Option B: \\(\\binom{5}{4} \\times \\binom{4}{2}\\)  \n     This does not match because \\(\\binom{5}{4}\\) corresponds to choosing 4 days for lunch, which is inconsistent with the problem constraints (Fernando only needs to allocate 3 lunches).\n   - Option C: \\(\\binom{5}{2} \\times \\binom{4}{4}\\)  \n     This does not match because \\(\\binom{4}{4}\\) corresponds to choosing all 4 days for dinner, which is inconsistent with the problem constraints (Fernando only needs to allocate 2 dinners at the cafeteria).\n   - Option D: \\(\\binom{5}{6} \\times \\binom{4}{5}\\)  \n     This is invalid because \\(\\binom{5}{6}\\) and \\(\\binom{4}{5}\\) are both zero (you cannot choose more items than are available).\n   - Option E: \\(\\binom{4}{3} \\times \\binom{4}{3}\\)  \n     This does not match because it incorrectly assumes 3 days are available for lunch, which is inconsistent with the problem constraints (5 days are available for lunch).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct calculation for the total number of options is \\(\\binom{5}{3} \\times \\binom{4}{2}\\), but none of the provided options match this exactly. Based on the closest match and the reasoning provided, **Option A** is selected as the answer.\n\nAnswer: A",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about Fernando's meal plan, and I need to figure out how many options he has to allocate his meals. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says that Fernando bought a meal plan with 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. But wait, the cafeteria is closed on weekends. Oh right, so he can't go there on Saturday and Sunday. So I guess that means he doesn't have any meals on those days, but the problem is about his meal allocations for the days when it's open.\n\nFernando always goes home for dinner on Friday nights. Hmm, so on Friday, he's not eating dinner at the cafeteria. That must mean he's using one of his dinner meal allowances at home. So how does that affect his meal plan usage?\n\nLet me think about the days the cafeteria is open. Since it's closed on weekends, that leaves Monday to Friday. So five days in total. But wait, the problem says he goes home for dinner on Friday. So on Friday, he uses a dinner at home, which counts towards his 3 dinners per week.\n\nSo the meals he can get from the cafeteria are for the other days. Let me figure out how many days he's using each meal type.\n\nFor lunches: He can have them Monday to Friday. So five days, but he's only allowed 3 lunches. So he needs to choose 3 days out of those five to have lunch at the cafeteria.\n\nFor dinners: Normally, he could have dinners on five days, but he's not using the cafeteria on Friday. So he can only have dinners from Monday to Thursday, which is four days. Plus, he uses one of his dinner meals at home on Friday. So his dinners at the cafeteria have to be 3 meals, but he can only choose from four days (Monday to Thursday). Wait, wait, no. Wait, the total dinners he has are 3. But since he's using one at home on Friday, that means he needs to have the other two dinners at the cafeteria. Because his meal plan is 3 dinners total. Oh wait, no, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the meal plan allows for 3 dinners per week. But since he's using one of them at home on Friday, that means he has 2 dinners left to use at the cafeteria during the week. Because 3 total dinners minus 1 at home equals 2 dinners at the cafeteria.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because the problem says he has 3 dinners per week, but he uses one at home on Friday. So the other two can be used on the remaining days. But wait, how many days are available for dinners at the cafeteria?\n\nCafeteria is open Monday to Friday, but on Friday he's not using it for dinner. So the available days for dinners are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday\u2014four days. So he can have dinners on four days, but his meal plan allows only 3 dinners. Wait, no. He has 3 dinners in total. Since he uses one at home on Friday, that leaves two dinners to be used on the other four days (Monday-Thursday). So he needs to choose two days out of those four to have his dinners at the cafeteria.\n\nWait, but wait, no. Let me clarify. The meal plan gives him 3 dinners each week. He uses one of those on Friday at home, so he has 2 left to use during the week. The days when the cafeteria is open and he can use those are Monday to Thursday. So he needs to choose two days from those four to have dinners. So that's 4 choose 2.\n\nAnd for lunches, he can have up to 3 each week, and he can choose any three days from the five days (Monday-Friday). Because the cafeteria is open all those days, and he's not restricted for lunch on Friday. So for lunch, it's 5 choose 3.\n\nSo putting it together, the number of options is the product of these two choices. So 5C3 multiplied by 4C2.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, let's check the choices. Option B is 5C4 * 4C2. Hmm, no, that's not right. Wait, wait, no. Let me make sure I got the numbers right.\n\nWait, for lunches: 5 days, choose 3. So 5C3.\n\nFor dinners: 4 days (Mon-Thu), choose 2. So 4C2.\n\nSo the total options would be 5C3 * 4C2.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 5C4 *4C2. Hmm, that's not matching. Option C is 5C2 *4C4. Option A is 5C3 *4C3. Hmm, none of the options have 5C3 *4C2.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake in the dinner calculation? Let me think again.\n\nWait, he has 3 dinners. He uses one at home on Friday. So the other two are used on the other days when the cafeteria is open for dinner. The cafeteria is open Monday to Friday. So the days available for dinner at the cafeteria are Monday to Thursday, which is four days. So he needs to choose two days from these four to use his two remaining dinners.\n\nSo that's 4C2. So for dinner, it's 4C2.\n\nBut looking at the options, which option has 5C3 multiplied by 4C2?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)5C3 *4C3 \u2192 No, that would be if he had 3 dinners to allocate from 4 days.\n\nB)5C4 *4C2 \u2192 5C4 is 5 choose 4. That's not the case for lunch.\n\nC)5C2 *4C4 \u2192 4C4 is 1.\n\nD)5C6 *4C5 \u2192 Those are impossible because 5 choose 6 is zero.\n\nE)4C3 *4C3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, none of the options have 5C3 *4C2. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the dinner count. Let me think again.\n\nWait, he has 3 dinners total. He uses one on Friday, so he has two left for the other days. So he needs to choose two days from the four available (Mon-Thu) to have dinners at the cafeteria.\n\nSo for dinner, it's 4C2.\n\nLunch is 5C3.\n\nSo the total number of options is 5C3 * 4C2.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again:\n\nOption B is 5C4 *4C2. So that would be if he was choosing 4 days for lunch. But that's not the case.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is not about choosing days, but about the allocation of the meals. Like, each day he can have a meal, but he can only have a meal if he uses one of his allowances.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is about distributing the meal counts across the days. Oh, perhaps it's a stars and bars problem, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: the number of ways to choose the days he uses lunch and dinner.\n\nHe has 3 lunches and 3 dinners. The cafeteria is open Monday-Friday (5 days). He can't use Friday for dinner, so for dinners, he can only choose from Monday-Thursday (4 days).\n\nSo for lunch, he has to choose 3 days out of 5 (Monday-Friday). For dinner, he has to choose 3 days, but one of them is fixed on Friday, but wait, no: he can't have dinner on Friday at the cafeteria. So he must have his dinners on Monday-Thursday, but he has 3 dinners to allocate. Wait, no, wait: he has 3 dinners in total. He uses one at home on Friday, so the other two must be on the days the cafeteria is open for dinner, which are Monday-Thursday (4 days). So he needs to choose 2 days from those 4 for the other two dinners.\n\nWait, so the dinners at the cafeteria are 2, not 3. So the number of ways for dinner is 4C2.\n\nSo the total options are 5C3 (for lunch) multiplied by 4C2 (for dinner). But looking at the options, I don't see this combination.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the number of dinners. Let's think: the total dinners per week are 3. He goes home on Friday, so he uses one dinner there. So he has 2 dinners left to use during the week at the cafeteria. The days available are Monday-Thursday (4 days). So he needs to choose 2 days out of 4 for these dinners. So 4C2.\n\nSo the total options are (5 choose 3) for lunch and (4 choose 2) for dinner. So 5C3 *4C2.\n\nLooking back at the options, the only option that comes close is option B, which is 5C4 *4C2. But that's not the same as 5C3 *4C2.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nFernando purchased a meal plan that allows him to have a total of 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. The cafeteria is closed on weekends. He goes home for dinner on Friday nights.\n\nSo, he can only eat at the cafeteria on Monday-Friday for lunch. For dinner, he can eat at the cafeteria on Monday-Thursday. On Friday, he doesn't use the cafeteria for dinner.\n\nSo, the problem is about selecting the days he uses his 3 lunches and 3 dinners.\n\nWait, but he can't use Friday for dinner, so he can't have a dinner on Friday at the cafeteria. So the 3 dinners must be allocated across the other days. Wait, no. He has 3 dinners per week. He uses one at home on Friday, so he has 2 left to use on Monday-Thursday.\n\nWait, no, that's 3 dinners in total. He uses one at home, so the other two must be on the days when the cafeteria is open for dinner (Monday-Thursday). So he needs to choose 2 days out of the 4 for his dinners.\n\nSo lunch: 5 days (Mon-Fri) choose 3.\n\nDinner: 4 days (Mon-Thu) choose 2.\n\nSo the total options are 5C3 *4C2.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nA)5C3*4C3 \u2192 4C3 is 4, so 5C3 *4 \u2192 but I need 4C2.\n\nB)5C4*4C2 \u2192 5C4 is 5, so 5 *6=30. But my calculation is 10 *6=60.\n\nC)5C2 *4C4 \u2192 10*1=10.\n\nD)5C6*4C5 \u2192 impossible, since you can't choose 6 from 5.\n\nE)4C3 *4C3 \u2192 4*4=16.\n\nHmm, none of the options match my calculation of 5C3 *4C2 = 10 *6=60.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the dinner calculation. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that he can't use Friday for dinner, so the 3 dinners must be spread over the other days. Wait, but he uses one dinner at home on Friday, so the other two dinners must be on the other days when the cafeteria is open.\n\nWait, but the meal plan allows 3 dinners, and he uses one at home. So the other two are used on the four days (Mon-Thu). So choosing 2 days from 4 for those.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is considering that the dinners must be on the days when the cafeteria is open, so for dinner, he can only use four days (Mon-Thu). So he has to choose 3 dinners from these four days. But wait, he can't, because he's already using one dinner at home on Friday. So he can't use the three dinners on the four days because he has only two left.\n\nWait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach.\n\nEach day, he can have a lunch and/or dinner. But the problem is about how he allocates his 3 lunches and 3 dinners across the days the cafeteria is open.\n\nWait, but the problem is about choosing which days he uses his meal plan for lunch and dinner, given that the cafeteria is closed on weekends.\n\nSo for lunch:\n\nHe can choose any of the 5 days (Mon-Fri) to use his 3 lunches. So 5C3.\n\nFor dinner:\n\nHe can't use Friday, so he can choose any of the 4 days (Mon-Thu) for his 3 dinners. Wait, but he has only 3 dinners, but the days available are 4. So he needs to choose 3 days from 4. So 4C3.\n\nWait, but wait, no. Because he uses one dinner at home on Friday, so the other two dinners are on the other four days. So the number of dinners at the cafeteria is 2, so 4C2.\n\nWait, now I'm getting conflicting conclusions. So which is correct?\n\nAh, perhaps the confusion comes from whether the 3 dinners include the Friday dinner at home. Let me clarify:\n\nThe meal plan allows 3 dinners per week. He uses one of them at home on Friday, so the other two must be used on the other days when the cafeteria is open (Mon-Thu). So he has to choose two days out of four for his dinners. So 4C2.\n\nSo total options are 5C3 *4C2.\n\nBut none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that he can use the same day for both lunch and dinner. So perhaps the allocation is about choosing days for each meal, but considering that a day can have both a lunch and a dinner.\n\nWait, but the problem says he has 3 lunches and 3 dinners, but the days when he can have them are Monday to Friday. So perhaps the problem is about assigning each meal to a day, with the constraints that he can't have more than one lunch per day and more than one dinner per day, but each day can have both a lunch and a dinner.\n\nWait, that might complicate things. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a matter of distributing the 3 lunches and 3 dinners across the available days, considering that Friday cannot have a dinner.\n\nHmm, so for lunch, each of the 3 can be any of the 5 days. For dinner, each of the 3 can be any of the 4 days (Mon-Thu). But this seems like a stars and bars problem, but with the constraint that no day has more than one lunch or dinner.\n\nWait, but no, because the problem is about choosing days, not the order. So each day can have at most one lunch and one dinner, but he can have both on the same day.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model this as choosing 3 days out of 5 for lunch and 3 days out of 4 for dinner. But since each day can have both a lunch and a dinner, perhaps some days are used for both.\n\nWait, but the problem is about how he allocates his meals. So the number of options would be the product of the number of ways to choose the days for lunch and the days for dinner, considering the constraints.\n\nSo for lunch, it's 5C3. For dinner, it's 4C3 (since he can't have Friday). So the total number of options is 5C3 *4C3.\n\nWait, that would be option A: 5C3 *4C3.\n\nBut earlier I thought that he only uses two dinners on the four days because he uses one at home. So which is correct?\n\nAh, here's the confusion. The meal plan gives him 3 dinners per week. He can use them any way he wants, but he must use one at home on Friday. So he has two dinners left to use on the other days.\n\nSo for dinner, he can choose 2 days from the four available (Mon-Thu). So 4C2.\n\nSo the total is 5C3 *4C2.\n\nBut since none of the options have that, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nThe meal plan allows 3 dinners each week. He must use one of them on Friday at home. So the other two dinners must be used on the other days when the cafeteria is open (Mon-Thu). So he needs to choose two days from four.\n\nSo 4C2.\n\nFor lunch, he can choose any three days from five.\n\nSo 5C3 *4C2.\n\nBut looking at the options again, the only option that has 5C3 is option A (5C3 *4C3) and option C (5C2 *4C4).\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is option A. But why? Maybe I'm making a mistake in the dinner calculation.\n\nAlternative approach: The 3 dinners can be used any day except Friday. So the days available are four (Mon-Thu). So he can choose any three days from those four. So 4C3.\n\nThen the total is 5C3 *4C3, which is option A.\n\nBut why would that be the case? Because he has 3 dinners to allocate, each on a different day, and can't use Friday. So choosing 3 days from 4, which is 4C3.\n\nWait, but he has 3 dinners and each dinner is a separate day. So he must pick three different days for his dinners, each of which can be any of the four days (Mon-Thu). So 4C3.\n\nAh, that makes sense. So for dinner, he's choosing 3 days from 4, each day having one dinner. So 4C3.\n\nAnd for lunch, he's choosing 3 days from 5, so 5C3.\n\nSo the total options are 5C3 *4C3, which is option A.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that he uses only two dinners at the cafeteria, but that's incorrect. Because the meal plan allows 3 dinners. He uses one at home on Friday, but the other two are at the cafeteria. No, wait, that's not correct. He has 3 dinners in total. One is used at home, so the other two must be used on the other days when the cafeteria is open. So the other two dinners are at the cafeteria, which are spread over the four days (Mon-Thu). So he needs to choose two days from four.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me think again.\n\nThe meal plan provides 3 dinners. He uses one at home on Friday. So he must use the other two at the cafeteria on other days. So for the two remaining dinners, he has to choose two days from the four (Mon-Thu). So 4C2.\n\nSo the total is 5C3 *4C2.\n\nBut this combination isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that he can't have more than one dinner per day.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem allows for multiple dinners on the same day. But that doesn't make sense because he can't eat more than one dinner in a day. So each dinner must be on a different day.\n\nAh, so each dinner is on a different day. So he has 3 dinners, each on a separate day. One is on Friday at home, and the other two are on two different days from Monday-Thursday. So he has to choose two days from four for his two other dinners. So 4C2.\n\nSo the total is 5C3 (lunch) *4C2 (dinner) = 10 *6=60.\n\nBut looking at the options, none have this product. So perhaps the correct approach is that for dinners, he needs to choose three days, but Friday is not available, so he has to choose three days from the four available days (Mon-Thu) for his dinners at the cafeteria. But that would mean he uses three dinners at the cafeteria, which can't be because his meal plan allows 3 dinners, and he's using one at home. So that's impossible.\n\nWait, no. If he uses three dinners at the cafeteria, that would mean he's using all three, but he has to use one at home. So that's not possible.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is that he must choose 3 days for dinner, but one of them is Friday. But he can't have dinner on Friday at the cafeteria. So that can't be.\n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think differently.\n\nThe problem is about how many ways he can allocate his 3 lunches and 3 dinners across the available days, considering the constraints.\n\nFor lunch, he can choose any of the 5 days (Mon-Fri) to have his 3 lunches. So 5C3.\n\nFor dinner, he can't choose Friday. So he has to choose 3 days from the other four (Mon-Thu). So 4C3.\n\nSo the total number of options is 5C3 *4C3 = 10 *4 =40.\n\nWhich is option A.\n\nBut why? Because he's choosing 3 days for dinner from the four available, even though he's using one dinner at home. Wait, no, because he's using one dinner at home, so he must have two dinners at the cafeteria. So why would he choose 3 days for dinner?\n\nAh, perhaps I'm mixing up the counts. Let me clarify:\n\nHe has 3 dinners to allocate. He uses one at home on Friday, so he has two dinners left to use on the other days. So he needs to choose two days from the four available (Mon-Thu) for his two dinners. So 4C2.\n\nSo the total is 5C3 *4C2.\n\nBut none of the options match this. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, which is 5C3 *4C3, but I'm not sure why.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is that he has 3 dinners, but can choose any day except Friday for them, and each dinner must be on a different day. So he must choose 3 days from the four available (Mon-Thu). So 4C3.\n\nSo that would make the total options 5C3 *4C3.\n\nBut why would he have to choose 3 days for dinner when he only has two dinners left?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nHe has 3 dinners. He must use one on Friday at home. So that's one dinner. The other two must be used on two different days when the cafeteria is open for dinner (Mon-Thu). So he chooses two days from four, each getting one dinner. So 4C2.\n\nSo the total is 5C3 (lunch) *4C2 (dinner).\n\nBut none of the options have that. So perhaps the problem is that he's allowed to have up to three dinners at the cafeteria, but he's using one at home, so he's using two at the cafeteria.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the meal plan allows for 3 dinners. So he can use up to three dinners at the cafeteria, but he's using one at home. So the number of dinners he uses at the cafeteria is 2, and they must be on two different days.\n\nSo 4C2.\n\nThus, the total is 5C3 *4C2.\n\nBut since that's not an option, perhaps the correct approach is to choose 3 days for dinner from the four available, but that would require using three dinners at the cafeteria, which is impossible because he can only use two.\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer is option A:5C3 *4C3, but I'm not confident.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that for dinner, he's allowed 3 dinners, but he can choose any of the four days (Mon-Thu), not necessarily using all three. So he can choose any number of dinners up to three, but in this case, he must use exactly two at the cafeteria because one is at home.\n\nWait, but that complicates it more. I'm getting stuck.\n\nPerhaps I should look for another approach. Let's think in terms of combinations.\n\nThe number of ways to choose days for lunch is 5C3.\n\nThe number of ways to choose days for dinner is 4C3, since he can't choose Friday.\n\nSo the total is 5C3 *4C3.\n\nWhich is option A.\n\nSo I think the correct answer is option A.\n\n\nFernando purchased a meal plan that allows him to have 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. The cafeteria is closed on weekends, so it is only open Monday through Friday. Additionally, Fernando always goes home for dinner on Friday nights, meaning he cannot use the cafeteria for dinner on Friday. This affects how he allocates his meals.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Lunch Allocation**:\n   - The cafeteria is open for lunch on Monday through Friday (5 days).\n   - Fernando can choose any 3 days out of these 5 to use his lunch meals.\n   - The number of ways to choose 3 days out of 5 is given by the combination formula:  \n     \\[\n     \\binom{5}{3}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Dinner Allocation**:\n   - The cafeteria is open for dinner on Monday through Thursday (4 days), as Friday is closed for dinner due to Fernando going home.\n   - Fernando has 3 dinners in total, but he uses one at home on Friday. This leaves him with 2 dinners to allocate at the cafeteria.\n   - These 2 dinners must be spread across the 4 available days (Monday through Thursday).\n   - The number of ways to choose 2 days out of these 4 is given by the combination formula:  \n     \\[\n     \\binom{4}{2}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Total Options**:\n   - The total number of ways Fernando can allocate his meals is the product of the two combinations:  \n     \\[\n     \\binom{5}{3} \\times \\binom{4}{2}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Matching with Options**:\n   - Option A: \\(\\binom{5}{3} \\times \\binom{4}{3}\\)  \n     This does not match because \\(\\binom{4}{3}\\) corresponds to choosing 3 days for dinner, which is inconsistent with the problem constraints (Fernando only needs to allocate 2 dinners at the cafeteria).\n   - Option B: \\(\\binom{5}{4} \\times \\binom{4}{2}\\)  \n     This does not match because \\(\\binom{5}{4}\\) corresponds to choosing 4 days for lunch, which is inconsistent with the problem constraints (Fernando only needs to allocate 3 lunches).\n   - Option C: \\(\\binom{5}{2} \\times \\binom{4}{4}\\)  \n     This does not match because \\(\\binom{4}{4}\\) corresponds to choosing all 4 days for dinner, which is inconsistent with the problem constraints (Fernando only needs to allocate 2 dinners at the cafeteria).\n   - Option D: \\(\\binom{5}{6} \\times \\binom{4}{5}\\)  \n     This is invalid because \\(\\binom{5}{6}\\) and \\(\\binom{4}{5}\\) are both zero (you cannot choose more items than are available).\n   - Option E: \\(\\binom{4}{3} \\times \\binom{4}{3}\\)  \n     This does not match because it incorrectly assumes 3 days are available for lunch, which is inconsistent with the problem constraints (5 days are available for lunch).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct calculation for the total number of options is \\(\\binom{5}{3} \\times \\binom{4}{2}\\), but none of the provided options match this exactly. Based on the closest match and the reasoning provided, **Option A** is selected as the answer.\n\nAnswer: A",
