I'm a bit rusty on geometry, but I'll take it slow.\n\nThe problem says the plot is rectangular and has a perimeter of 340 meters. They want to create a 1-meter broad boundary around it. The rate is 10 per square meter. I need to find the cost.\n\nWait, so first, I should probably find the area of this boundary, right? Because the cost depends on the area multiplied by the rate. But how do I find the area of this 1-meter wide boundary around the rectangle?\n\nI remember that when you add a border around a shape, the new area is the area of the bigger shape minus the original area. So maybe I should find the area of the original plot and the area after adding the 1-meter border, then subtract the two to get the area of the border.\n\nBut wait, I don't know the exact dimensions of the rectangle\u2014like its length and width. The perimeter is given, though. Perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + width). So 340 = 2*(l + w), which means l + w = 170. But without knowing l and w individually, how can I find the area of the original plot?\n\nHmm, maybe I don't need the exact area of the plot. Let's think about the border. The border is 1 meter wide all around. So the new rectangle (including the border) will have length and width each increased by 2 meters. Because 1 meter on each side.\n\nSo, the new length is l + 2, and the new width is w + 2. So the area of the new plot is (l + 2)*(w + 2), and the original area is l * w. The area of the border would be (l +2)(w+2) - l*w.\n\nExpanding that, (l +2)(w +2) = l*w + 2l + 2w +4. Subtract l*w, so the area becomes 2l + 2w +4. That's the area of the border.\n\nWait, so the area of the border is 2l + 2w +4. But wait, from earlier, I know that l + w = 170. So 2l + 2w is 2*(l +w) = 2*170 = 340. So the area is 340 +4 = 344 square meters.\n\nOh, okay, so the area of the border is 344 m\u00b2. Then, the cost is rate multiplied by area, which is 10 * 344 = 3440.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 3440. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Did I calculate the border area correctly? The original plot's perimeter is 340, so l + w = 170. The border adds 1m on each side, so each dimension increases by 2m. The area of the border is (l+2)(w+2) - l w = l w +2l +2w +4 - l w = 2(l +w) +4 = 2*170 +4 = 340 +4=344. Yes, that seems right.\n\nSo the cost is 344 *10 = 3440, which is option C.\n",

The options are given, but I should figure it out myself first.\n\nWait, so the plot is rectangular. The perimeter is 340 m. I remember the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as 2*(length + width). But wait, do I know the exact dimensions of length and width? No, just the perimeter. So maybe I don't need them specifically? Or perhaps I do for calculating the area.\n\nWait, the boundary is 1 metre broad. So I think this means there's a 1-metre wide strip around the entire plot. So the area of this boundary would be the area of the outer rectangle minus the area of the inner plot.\n\nLet me visualize this. Imagine the original plot is L x W. The boundary adds 1 metre all around, so the outer dimensions become (L+2) and (W+2) because you add 1 metre to each side. So the area of the boundary would be (L+2)*(W+2) - L*W.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this gardening cost problem. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says: What will be the cost of gardening a 1-metre broad boundary around a rectangular plot that has a perimeter of 340 metres. The rate is 10 per square metre. The options are A to E.\n\nHmm, I think the first thing I should do is visualize the problem. There's a rectangular plot, and around it, there's a 1-meter-wide boundary. So, the boundary is like a strip around the rectangle. I need to find the area of this boundary and then multiply by the rate to get the cost.\n\nWait, but how do I find the area of this boundary? I remember that the perimeter is given, which is 340 meters. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as 2*(length + width). But I don't know the length and width individually, only their sum. Let's see.\n\nSo, perimeter P = 2*(l + w) = 340. Therefore, l + w = 170. But without more information, I can't find the exact values of l and w. Hmm, but maybe I don't need them individually. Because the boundary is 1 meter wide around, maybe the area can be found without knowing l and w separately.\n\nWait, the area of the boundary. Another approach: the boundary is 1m wide, so it's like adding a strip around the rectangle. The area of this boundary would be the area of the larger rectangle (including the boundary) minus the area of the original rectangle.\n\nRight, so the original rectangle has length l and width w. The area is l*w.\n\nThe larger rectangle, which includes the boundary, would have length increased by 1m on both sides, so total addition is 2m. Similarly, the width increases by 2m (1m on each side). So the new dimensions are (l+2) and (w+2). The area of the larger rectangle is (l+2)*(w+2).\n\nSo the area of the boundary is (l+2)(w+2) - l*w. Let me expand that: l*w + 2l + 2w +4 - l*w = 2l + 2w +4.\n\nWait, that's 2(l + w) +4. But from the perimeter, we know l + w is 170, because 2(l + w) = 340. So substituting, the area of the boundary is 2*(170) +4 = 340 +4 = 344 square meters.\n\nOh, wait, no. Wait, the calculation I did earlier: (l+2)(w+2) - l w equals 2l + 2w +4, right? So 2(l + w) +4. Since l + w is 170, 2*170 = 340. 340 +4=344.\n\nSo the area of the boundary is 344 m\u00b2. Now, the rate is 10 per square meter. So the cost is 344 * 10 = 3440.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 3440. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I make a mistake in the area calculation? Because sometimes when you have a border around a rectangle, the area could be calculated differently. For example, sometimes people might calculate it as the perimeter multiplied by the width of the border, but I think that only works for a uniform border around a square or when the border is added in such a way that it's a frame. But in reality, for a rectangle, the area of the border is indeed (l+2w)(w+2w) - l w, which is what I did.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it: the border can be thought of as two parts. The two longer sides each have an area of length * width (1m). But wait, no. Because when you add a 1m border, the length of the longer sides increases by 2m (1 on each end), same with the width. So maybe the border area is the sum of the areas of the four sides, minus the overlapping corners. Because if I just calculate 2*(length + width)*1m, that gives the area without the corners. But the corners are squares of 1x1m each, so four corners, each 1 m\u00b2, so 4 m\u00b2. So total area would be 2*(l + w)*1 + 4. Which is the same as 2(l + w) +4. Which brings me back to the same calculation.\n\nSo 2*(170) +4 = 344 m\u00b2. So yes, 344. Then multiply by 10, getting 3440, which is option C.\n\nWait, but another approach: the perimeter is 340, so if I think of the border as a strip around, the area would be perimeter * width of the strip, but that doesn't account for the four corners. Because when you multiply perimeter by width, you're adding the area of the strip as if it's a continuous path, but in reality, the corners are squares that are part of the border. So the correct formula is perimeter * width + 4*(width)^2. Since the width is 1m, 4*(1)^2=4. So yes, the area is 340 *1 +4=344 m\u00b2.\n\nSo the cost is 344 *10=3440. So the correct answer is C, 3440.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this gardening cost problem. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says: What will be the cost of gardening a 1-metre broad boundary around a rectangular plot that has a perimeter of 340 metres. The rate is 10 per square metre. The options are A to E.\n\nHmm, I think the first thing I should do is visualize the problem. There's a rectangular plot, and around it, there's a 1-meter-wide boundary. So, the boundary is like a strip around the rectangle. I need to find the area of this boundary and then multiply by the rate to get the cost.\n\nWait, but how do I find the area of this boundary? I remember that the perimeter is given, which is 340 meters. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as 2*(length + width). But I don't know the length and width individually, only their sum. Let's see.\n\nSo, perimeter P = 2*(l + w) = 340. Therefore, l + w = 170. But without more information, I can't find the exact values of l and w. Hmm, but maybe I don't need them individually. Because the boundary is 1 meter wide around, maybe the area can be found without knowing l and w separately.\n\nWait, the area of the boundary. Another approach: the boundary is 1m wide, so it's like adding a strip around the rectangle. The area of this boundary would be the area of the larger rectangle (including the boundary) minus the area of the original rectangle.\n\nRight, so the original rectangle has length l and width w. The area is l*w.\n\nThe larger rectangle, which includes the boundary, would have length increased by 1m on both sides, so total addition is 2m. Similarly, the width increases by 2m (1m on each side). So the new dimensions are (l+2) and (w+2). The area of the larger rectangle is (l+2)*(w+2).\n\nSo the area of the boundary is (l+2)(w+2) - l*w. Let me expand that: l*w + 2l + 2w +4 - l*w = 2l + 2w +4.\n\nWait, that's 2(l + w) +4. But from the perimeter, we know l + w is 170, because 2(l + w) = 340. So substituting, the area of the boundary is 2*(170) +4 = 340 +4 = 344 square meters.\n\nOh, wait, no. Wait, the calculation I did earlier: (l+2)(w+2) - l w equals 2l + 2w +4, right? So 2(l + w) +4. Since l + w is 170, 2*170 = 340. 340 +4=344.\n\nSo the area of the boundary is 344 m\u00b2. Now, the rate is 10 per square meter. So the cost is 344 * 10 = 3440.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 3440. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I make a mistake in the area calculation? Because sometimes when you have a border around a rectangle, the area could be calculated differently. For example, sometimes people might calculate it as the perimeter multiplied by the width of the border, but I think that only works for a uniform border around a square or when the border is added in such a way that it's a frame. But in reality, for a rectangle, the area of the border is indeed (l+2w)(w+2w) - l w, which is what I did.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it: the border can be thought of as two parts. The two longer sides each have an area of length * width (1m). But wait, no. Because when you add a 1m border, the length of the longer sides increases by 2m (1 on each end), same with the width. So maybe the border area is the sum of the areas of the four sides, minus the overlapping corners. Because if I just calculate 2*(length + width)*1m, that gives the area without the corners. But the corners are squares of 1x1m each, so four corners, each 1 m\u00b2, so 4 m\u00b2. So total area would be 2*(l + w)*1 + 4. Which is the same as 2(l + w) +4. Which brings me back to the same calculation.\n\nSo 2*(170) +4 = 344 m\u00b2. So yes, 344. Then multiply by 10, getting 3440, which is option C.\n\nWait, but another approach: the perimeter is 340, so if I think of the border as a strip around, the area would be perimeter * width of the strip, but that doesn't account for the four corners. Because when you multiply perimeter by width, you're adding the area of the strip as if it's a continuous path, but in reality, the corners are squares that are part of the border. So the correct formula is perimeter * width + 4*(width)^2. Since the width is 1m, 4*(1)^2=4. So yes, the area is 340 *1 +4=344 m\u00b2.\n\nSo the cost is 344 *10=3440. So the correct answer is C, 3440.\n\n\nTo determine the cost of gardening a 1-meter-wide boundary around a rectangular plot with a perimeter of 340 meters at a rate of 10 per square meter, the following steps are taken:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The boundary is a 1-meter-wide strip around the rectangular plot. The area of the boundary can be calculated as the difference between the area of the larger rectangle (including the boundary) and the original rectangle.\n\n2. **Perimeter of the Original Rectangle**: The perimeter of the original rectangle is given as 340 meters. For a rectangle, the perimeter is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   P = 2(l + w) \\implies l + w = \\frac{P}{2} = \\frac{340}{2} = 170\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( l \\) and \\( w \\) are the length and width of the original rectangle, respectively.\n\n3. **Area of the Boundary**: The boundary is 1 meter wide, so the larger rectangle (including the boundary) has dimensions \\((l + 2)\\) and \\((w + 2)\\). The area of the boundary is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of Boundary} = (l + 2)(w + 2) - lw\n   \\]\n   Expanding \\((l + 2)(w + 2)\\):\n   \\[\n   (l + 2)(w + 2) = lw + 2l + 2w + 4\n   \\]\n   Subtracting \\( lw \\) (the area of the original rectangle):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of Boundary} = 2l + 2w + 4 = 2(l + w) + 4\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( l + w = 170 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of Boundary} = 2(170) + 4 = 340 + 4 = 344 \\, \\text{m}^2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Cost of Gardening**: The rate is 10 per square meter. Therefore, the total cost is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost} = \\text{Area of Boundary} \\times \\text{Rate} = 344 \\times 10 = 3440\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verification**: The area of the boundary can also be calculated as the perimeter of the original rectangle multiplied by the width of the boundary, plus the area of the four corners:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of Boundary} = P \\times \\text{Width} + 4 \\times (\\text{Width})^2 = 340 \\times 1 + 4 \\times 1^2 = 340 + 4 = 344 \\, \\text{m}^2\n   \\]\n   This confirms the earlier calculation.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The total cost of gardening the boundary is 3440, which corresponds to option C.\n\nAnswer: C",

Let me try to model this. Let's say the original plot has length L and width W. So the perimeter is 2(L + W) = 340. So L + W = 170. That's one equation, but I have two variables, so maybe I can't find exact values for L and W.\n\nBut for the area of the strip, perhaps the L and W will cancel out. Let me see. The outer rectangle will have a length of L + 2 (since 1m is added on both ends) and a width of W + 2. So the area of the outer rectangle is (L+2)(W+2). The inner area is L*W.\n\nSo the area of the strip is (L+2)(W+2) - L*W. Let me expand that: LW + 2L + 2W +4 - LW = 2L + 2W +4.

The area can be calculated as the perimeter multiplied by the width of the border plus the area of the four corners. Wait, that's another approach.

The area of the strip is the area of the outer rectangle minus the area of the inner rectangle. So if I can find that difference, I can multiply by the rate to get the cost.\n\nBut how? Let me try to model this. Let's say the original plot has length L and width W. So the perimeter is 2(L + W) = 340. So L + W = 170. That's one equation, but I have two variables, so maybe I can't find exact values for L and W.\n\nBut for the area of the strip, perhaps the L and W will cancel out. Let me see. The outer rectangle will have a length of L + 2 (since 1m is added on both ends) and a width of W + 2. So the area of the outer rectangle is (L+2)(W+2). The inner area is L*W.\n\nSo the area of the strip is (L+2)(W+2) - L*W. Let me expand that: LW + 2L + 2W +4 - LW = 2L + 2W +4. Simplify that to 2(L + W) +4.\n\nWait, but from the perimeter equation, L + W is 170. So substituting that in, 2*170 +4 = 340 +4 = 344. So the area of the strip is 344 square metres.\n\nOh wait, wait, that makes sense because adding a 1m strip around a rectangle increases the perimeter by 2*2=4? No, no, the perimeter of the outer rectangle would be 2*( (L+2) + (W+2) ) = 2*(L + W +4 ) = 2*(170 +4 )= 348. But that's not needed here.\n\nWait, but the area of the strip is 344. Then the cost would be 344 * 10 = 3440. Looking at the options, option C is 3440. So that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Could I have made a mistake in the area calculation? Because sometimes when you add a border, especially with a width, the calculation can be tricky. Let me verify.\n\nAnother way: The area added is like a frame around the rectangle. The area can be calculated as the perimeter multiplied by the width of the border plus the area of the four corners. Wait, that's another approach. The perimeter is 340 m, and the width is 1 m, so 340 *1 = 340. Then the four corners each add 1*1 =1, so 4*1=4. So total area is 340 +4 = 344. Yep, same as before.\n\nSo the area is 344 m\u00b2, so cost is 344 *10 =3440. So option C is correct.\n\n\nTo determine the cost of gardening a 1-metre-wide boundary around a rectangular plot with a perimeter of 340 metres at a rate of 10 per square metre, we first calculate the area of the boundary.\n\nThe boundary adds a 1-metre-wide strip around the entire perimeter of the rectangle. The area of this strip can be calculated as the difference between the area of the outer rectangle (including the strip) and the inner rectangle (the original plot). \n\nLet the length and width of the original plot be \\( L \\) and \\( W \\), respectively. The perimeter of the original plot is given as \\( 2(L + W) = 340 \\), so \\( L + W = 170 \\).\n\nThe outer rectangle, after adding the 1-metre strip, will have dimensions \\( (L + 2) \\) and \\( (W + 2) \\). The area of the outer rectangle is \\( (L + 2)(W + 2) \\), and the area of the inner rectangle is \\( L \\cdot W \\). The area of the strip is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of the strip} = (L + 2)(W + 2) - L \\cdot W\n\\]\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\n\\[\n(L + 2)(W + 2) - L \\cdot W = L \\cdot W + 2L + 2W + 4 - L \\cdot W = 2L + 2W + 4\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( L + W = 170 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of the strip} = 2(170) + 4 = 340 + 4 = 344 \\, \\text{m}^2\n\\]\n\nThe cost of gardening is then:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost} = \\text{Area of the strip} \\times \\text{Rate} = 344 \\times 10 = 3440\n\\]\n\nThus, the total cost is **3440**, which corresponds to option **C**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this gardening cost problem. Let me read it again carefully. The question says: What will be the cost of gardening a 1-metre broad boundary around a rectangular plot that has a perimeter of 340 metres. The rate is 10 per square metre. The options are given, and I need to choose the right one.\n\nHmm, so the main idea here is to find the area of this boundary and then multiply it by the rate to get the total cost. But wait, how do I find the area of the boundary? I remember that when you have a boundary around a rectangle, it's like adding a strip around it. Maybe I can think of it as the area of the larger rectangle minus the area of the original plot.\n\nBut wait, I don't know the original dimensions of the plot, just the perimeter. Oh right, the perimeter is 340 metres. Since it's a rectangle, the perimeter P is calculated as 2*(length + width) = 340. So length + width = 170. But without knowing the individual length and width, how can I find the area? Hmm, maybe I don't need the exact area, but maybe the boundary's area can be found another way.\n\nWait a minute, the boundary is 1 metre wide. So the area of the boundary would be the area of the larger rectangle (which includes the boundary) minus the area of the original plot. Let me think about the larger rectangle. If the boundary is 1m all around, then the length of the larger rectangle would be original length + 2*1m, because you add 1m on each side. Similarly, the width would be original width + 2m.\n\nSo the area of the boundary is (L+2)(W+2) - (L*W). Let me expand that: L*W + 2L + 2W +4 - L*W. That simplifies to 2L + 2W +4. Oh, but I know that L + W is 170 from the perimeter. So 2(L + W) is 340. So 2L + 2W = 340. So adding the 4, the area becomes 340 +4 = 344 square metres.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the area of the boundary is 344. Then the cost is 344 multiplied by 10 per square metre. 344 *10 is 3440. So the cost should be 3440, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Another approach: the area of the boundary can be thought of as the perimeter multiplied by the width of the boundary plus the area added at the corners. Because when you add a strip around, the area is perimeter * width plus 4*(width)^2. Since the width is 1m, 4*(1)^2 =4. So yes, area is 340*1 +4= 344. So same result.\n\nSo the cost is 344 *10 =3440.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this gardening cost problem. Let me read it again carefully. The question says: What will be the cost of gardening a 1-metre broad boundary around a rectangular plot that has a perimeter of 340 metres. The rate is 10 per square metre. The options are given, and I need to choose the right one.\n\nHmm, so the main idea here is to find the area of this boundary and then multiply it by the rate to get the total cost. But wait, how do I find the area of the boundary? I remember that when you have a boundary around a rectangle, it's like adding a strip around it. Maybe I can think of it as the area of the larger rectangle minus the area of the original plot.\n\nBut wait, I don't know the original dimensions of the plot, just the perimeter. Oh right, the perimeter is 340 metres. Since it's a rectangle, the perimeter P is calculated as 2*(length + width) = 340. So length + width = 170. But without knowing the individual length and width, how can I find the area? Hmm, maybe I don't need the exact area, but maybe the boundary's area can be found another way.\n\nWait a minute, the boundary is 1 metre wide. So the area of the boundary would be the area of the larger rectangle (which includes the boundary) minus the area of the original plot. Let me think about the larger rectangle. If the boundary is 1m all around, then the length of the larger rectangle would be original length + 2*1m, because you add 1m on each side. Similarly, the width would be original width + 2m.\n\nSo the area of the boundary is (L+2)(W+2) - (L*W). Let me expand that: L*W + 2L + 2W +4 - L*W. That simplifies to 2L + 2W +4. Oh, but I know that L + W is 170 from the perimeter. So 2(L + W) is 340. So 2L + 2W = 340. So adding the 4, the area becomes 340 +4 = 344 square metres.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the area of the boundary is 344. Then the cost is 344 multiplied by 10 per square metre. 344 *10 is 3440. So the cost should be 3440, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Another approach: the area of the boundary can be thought of as the perimeter multiplied by the width of the boundary plus the area added at the corners. Because when you add a strip around, the area is perimeter * width plus 4*(width)^2. Since the width is 1m, 4*(1)^2 =4. So yes, area is 340*1 +4= 344. So same result.\n\nSo the cost is 344 *10 =3440.
