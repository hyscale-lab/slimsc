      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about an astronaut's weight on Earth and Venus, and I need to find out what percentage the Venus weight is of the Earth weight. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that weight changes depending on the planet's gravity. But wait, the question doesn't mention gravity directly, just the weights. Oh, right, so I can ignore the actual gravitational values because the question is about the ratio of the weights.\n\nThe astronaut weighs 211 pounds on Earth and 182 pounds on Venus. So I need to find what percent 182 is of 211. Oh, right, percentage calculation. So the formula is (part / whole) * 100. In this case, the part is Venus weight, and the whole is Earth weight.\n\nLet me do the calculation. So 182 divided by 211. Let me compute that. Hmm, 182 \u00f7 211. Let me see, 211 times 0.8 is 168.8, because 200*0.8 is 160, 11*0.8 is 8.8, total 168.8. 182 is higher than that. Let me try 0.86. 211 * 0.86. 200 *0.86 is 172, 11 *0.86 is 9.46. So 172+9.46=181.46. Oh wait, that's almost exactly 182. So 0.86 times 211 is about 181.46, which is very close to 182. So the percentage is approximately 86%.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 86%.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about an astronaut's weight on Earth and Venus. Hmm, I need to find out what percentage the Venus weight is compared to Earth. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nAlright, the astronaut weighs 211 pounds on Earth and 182 on Venus. The question is asking what percent 182 is of 211. Oh right, percentages are calculated by dividing the part by the whole and then multiplying by 100. So in this case, the \"part\" is the weight on Venus, and the \"whole\" is the weight on Earth.\n\nLet me write that out: (182 / 211) * 100. I need to calculate that. Wait, I should make sure I do the division correctly. Let me do 182 divided by 211. Let's see, 211 goes into 182 how many times? Well, 211 is bigger than 182, so it's less than 1. Maybe around 0.86? Because 0.86 times 211 would be approximately 181.46, which is close to 182.\n\nSo 0.86 multiplied by 100 is 86%. That would make the answer 86%, which is option D.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Maybe I should actually compute it more accurately. Let me do the division step by step.\n\nDividing 182 by 211. Let me set it up as 182 \u00f7 211.\n\nSince 211 is larger than 182, the result will be less than 1. Let's see:\n\n211 * 0.8 = 168.8. That's too low because 168.8 is less than 182. The difference is 182 - 168.8 = 13.2.\n\nSo 0.8 gives me 168.8. I need to find how much more to add to 0.8 to reach 182. Let me think, 211 * 0.06 = 12.66. Adding that to 168.8 gives 181.46, which is close to 182. So 0.86 would give approximately 181.46. The actual value is 182, which is a bit higher. So 0.86 gives 181.46, and 0.86 + a little more would get to 182.\n\nBut the question says \"approximately,\" so 86% should be the closest option. The options given are A)50%, B)60%, C)70%, D)86%, E)90%. So D is 86%, which matches my calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute it more precisely. Let's calculate 182 \u00f7 211 exactly.\n\nHmm, let's see, 211 into 182.000.\n\n211 goes into 1820 about 8 times because 8*211 is 1688. Subtracting that from 1820 gives 132. Bring down the next zero: 1320.\n\n211 goes into 1320 about 6 times (6*211=1266). Subtracting, 1320-1266=54. Bring down a zero: 540.\n\n211 goes into 540 about 2 times (2*211=422). Subtracting, 540-422=118. Bring down a zero: 1180.\n\n211 goes into 1180 about 5 times (5*211=1055). Subtracting gives 125. Bring down a zero: 1250.\n\n211 goes into 1250 about 5 times again (5*211=1055). Subtracting, 1250-1055=195. Bring down a zero: 1950.\n\n211 goes into 1950 about 9 times (9*211=1899). Subtracting, 1950-1899=51. Bring down a zero: 510.\n\n211 goes into 510 about 2 times (2*211=422). Subtracting, 510-422=88. Bring down a zero: 880.\n\n211 goes into 880 about 4 times (4*211=844). Subtracting, 880-844=36. Bring down a zero: 360.\n\n211 goes into 360 about 1 time (211). Subtracting, 360-211=149. Bring down a zero: 1490.\n\n211 goes into 1490 about 7 times (7*211=1477). Subtracting, 1490-1477=13. Bring down a zero: 130.\n\nAt this point, I can see the decimal is starting to repeat or go on. So putting it all together, 182 divided by 211 is approximately 0.8625... So 0.8625 times 100 is 86.25%. Rounding that to the nearest whole number gives 86%, which is option D.\n\nSo yeah, the answer should be D)86%.\n",

Hmm, the astronaut weighs 211 pounds on Earth and 182 pounds on Venus. The question is asking what percentage 182 is of 211. \n\nWait, so I need to find what percent 182 is of 211. I remember that to find a percentage, you divide the part by the whole and then multiply by 100. So the formula is (part/whole) * 100.

Let me do the division first. Hmm, 182 divided by 211. Well, 211 times 0.8 is 168.8, which is less than 182. Let me see, 0.85 times 211 is... 0.8*211=168.8, 0.05*211=10.55, so 168.8+10.55=179.35.

So we look at 1820 divided by 211. Let's see, 211 *8=1688. Subtracting that from 1820 gives 1820-1688=132. Bring down a zero: 1320. 211*6=1266. 1320-1266=54. So so far, we have 8.6...

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about an astronaut's weight on Earth and Venus. Let me think through it step by step. Hmm, the astronaut weighs 211 pounds on Earth and 182 pounds on Venus. The question is asking what percentage 182 is of 211. \n\nWait, so I need to find what percent 182 is of 211. I remember that to find a percentage, you divide the part by the whole and then multiply by 100. So the formula is (part/whole) * 100. In this case, the part is the weight on Venus, which is 182, and the whole is the weight on Earth, 211.\n\nLet me write that down: (182 / 211) * 100. I should calculate that. Let me do the division first. Hmm, 182 divided by 211. Well, 211 times 0.8 is 168.8, which is less than 182. Let me see, 0.85 times 211 is... 0.8*211=168.8, 0.05*211=10.55, so 168.8+10.55=179.35. That's still under 182. How about 0.86? Let's calculate 0.86 *211.\n\n211 * 0.8 = 168.8, 211 *0.06=12.66. So 168.8 +12.66=181.46. Oh, that's close to 182. So 0.86 gives us approximately 181.46. So 182 is a bit higher than that, so maybe around 86.2% or something like that.\n\nWait, but let me do the division more accurately. 182 divided by 211. Let me think, 211 goes into 182 zero times. So we look at 1820 divided by 211. Let's see, 211 *8=1688. Subtracting that from 1820 gives 1820-1688=132. Bring down a zero: 1320. 211*6=1266. 1320-1266=54. So so far, we have 8.6... So 86.0... percent. Hmm, but wait, we have 54 left. So next, 540 divided by 211 is about 2 times (422) which leaves 118. Hmm, but maybe I should stop here because we already have 86. So the percentage is approximately 86%.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 86%.
