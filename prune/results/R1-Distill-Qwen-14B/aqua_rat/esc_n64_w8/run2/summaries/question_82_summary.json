      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Julie's yard. Let me read it again. Hmm, the yard is rectangular. One side is 100 feet wide, and the total area is 3,000 square feet. The question is asking for the length of the other side. The options are A to E, with numbers 30, 20, 10, 50, and 60 feet.\n\nWait, I remember that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length and width. So the formula is area = length \u00d7 width. Right, so if one side is 100 feet, that's either the length or the width. Since the other dimension is what we're looking for, let's think about which one is which.\n\nWait, the problem says one side is 100 feet wide. Oh, so the width is 100 feet. That makes sense because width is usually the shorter side, but I don't think that's a rule here. Anyway, the area is 3000 square feet. So I need to find the other dimension, which would be the length.\n\nSo, rearranging the formula, the length would be area divided by width. Let me write that down. So length = area / width. Plugging in the numbers, area is 3000, width is 100. So 3000 divided by 100 is 30. Oh, so the length is 30 feet. Let me check the options. Option A is 30 feet. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I get the sides right? Sometimes, in problems, it's easy to mix up length and width. The problem says one side is 100 feet wide, so that's the width. The other side is the length, which we're finding. So yeah, 3000 divided by 100 is 30. So the length is 30 feet. That's option A.

If the yard is 100 feet wide and 30 feet long, then the area is 100 * 30, which is 3,000. Yep, that matches the given area. So that makes sense.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 30 feet. So I think that's the correct answer.\n\n\nTo determine the length of the other side of Julie's yard, we use the formula for the area of a rectangle: \n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width}.\n\\]\n\nGiven that the area is 3,000 square feet and one side (the width) is 100 feet, we can solve for the length:\n\n\\[\n\\text{length} = \\frac{\\text{Area}}{\\text{width}} = \\frac{3,000}{100} = 30 \\, \\text{feet}.\n\\]\n\nVerifying, if the yard is 100 feet wide and 30 feet long, the area is:\n\n\\[\n100 \\times 30 = 3,000 \\, \\text{square feet},\n\\]\n\nwhich matches the given area. Therefore, the length of the other side is 30 feet.\n\nAnswer: A",

And the total area is 3,000 square feet. I need to find the length of the other side.\n\nHmm, I remember that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So the formula is Area = length \u00d7 width. Right, so in this case, the area is 3,000 square feet, and one of the sides (which could be either length or width) is 100 feet.\n\nWait, the question says one side is 100 feet wide. So that must be the width. So the width is 100 feet, and I'm looking for the length. So rearranging the formula, length = area divided by width. So that would be 3000 divided by 100.\n\nLet me do the math. 3,000 divided by 100 is 30. So the length should be 30 feet. Looking at the options, option A is 30 feet. That makes sense.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I mix up length and width? The problem says one side is 100 feet wide. So the width is 100. So the other side is the length, which is 30.

The total area is 3,000 square feet. They're asking for the length of the other side. Hmm, I think I can figure this out with some basic math.\n\nWait, a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides. So if one side is 100 feet, the opposite side is also 100 feet. The other two sides are the same length, which is what we're looking for. So the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length and the width. Oh right, the formula is Area = length \u00d7 width.\n\nIn this case, one of the sides is given as 100 feet. But wait, which one is it? Length or width? I think in this context, width and length are just the two different sides. So whether it's the length or the width doesn't really matter because we're just looking for the other dimension. So let's say the known side is the width, which is 100 feet. Then the other side is the length.\n\nSo the area is 3,000 square feet. So I can set up the equation: Area = width \u00d7 length. Plugging in the numbers, 3000 = 100 \u00d7 length. Wait, no, actually, wait. Wait, wait a second. If the width is 100 feet, then the length would be the other side. Let me think again. Oh, wait, no. Wait, wait, if the area is 3000 and one side is 100, then the other side is 3000 divided by 100. Because area is length times width, so the other dimension is area divided by the known side.\n\nSo 3000 divided by 100 is 30. So the other side is 30 feet long. Let me double-check that. 100 multiplied by 30 is 3000, which matches the area. So that must be correct.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 30 feet. So the answer should be A. But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up length and width. Oh, because sometimes people refer to the longer side as length, but the problem doesn't specify which is longer.
