      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about ages, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe first part says, \"If 6 yrs are subtracted from the present age of Ajay and the remainder is divided by 18, then the present age of Rahul is obtained.\" Hmm. So, mathematically, that would be something like (Ajay's age - 6) divided by 18 equals Rahul's age. Let me write that down as an equation. Let's denote Ajay's age as A and Rahul's as R. So, (A - 6)/18 = R. Or maybe R = (A -6)/18. Wait, but that's if I subtract 6 from Ajay's age and then divide by 18, I get Rahul's age.\n\nThe second part says, \"If Rahul is 2 yrs younger to Denis whose age is 5 yrs.\" Wait, wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, wait, wait. Denis's age is 5 years? Because it says Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, whose age is 5. Oh, wait, no. Let me read that again. Oh, the wording is a bit tricky. It says, \"Rahul is 2 yrs younger to Denis whose age is 5 yrs.\" So, Denis's age is 5 years. So Rahul is two years younger than Denis, who is 5. So Rahul's age is 5 minus 2, which is 3. Wait, that can't be right because if Denis is 5, Rahul is 3. But wait, that seems young, but okay, let's go with it.\n\nSo R = D - 2, where D is Denis's age. And D is given as 5. So R = 5 - 2 = 3. So Rahul is 3 years old.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I interpreted that correctly. The question says, \"Rahul is 2 yrs younger to Denis whose age is 5 yrs.\" So, yeah, that means Rahul's age is Denis's age minus 2. So yes, R = 5 - 2 =3.\n\nSo now we have Rahul's age as 3. Now, going back to the first equation. R = (A-6)/18. So 3 = (A-6)/18. To find Ajay's age, I can rearrange this equation.\n\nMultiply both sides by 18: 3 *18 = A -6. 3*18 is 54. So 54 = A -6. Then, adding 6 to both sides gives A = 54 +6 = 60. So Ajay's present age is 60.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 60. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes I might have made a mistake. Let me go through again.\n\nDenis is 5 years old. Rahul is 2 years younger, so Rahul is 3. So R =3. Then (A-6)/18 =3. Multiply both sides by 18: A-6=54. So A=60. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer is 60, which is option B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves determining Ajay's present age based on the given relationships between the ages of Ajay, Rahul, and Denis. \n\n1. **Relationship Between Rahul and Denis**: The problem states that Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, whose age is 5 years. Therefore, Rahul's age is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   R = D - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 \\, \\text{years}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Relationship Between Ajay and Rahul**: The problem states that if 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's age and the remainder is divided by 18, Rahul's age is obtained.

Then, Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, whose age is 5 years. We need to find Ajay's present age.\n\nHmm, let me parse this out. First, let's note down what each person's age is based on the given information.\n\nDenis's age is given as 5 years. Wait, wait, wait. No, wait, the problem says \"Denis whose age is 5 yrs.\" So that's clear: Denis is 5 years old.\n\nRahul is 2 years younger than Denis. So if Denis is 5, Rahul's age is 5 minus 2, which is 3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when someone is younger, you subtract. So if Rahul is younger than Denis by 2 years, then Rahul's age is Denis's age minus 2. So 5 - 2 is 3. So Rahul is 3 years old.\n\nWait, wait, that seems a bit young, but maybe that's correct. Let me double-check. The problem says Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis. So yes, Rahul = Denis - 2.

So, mathematically, I think that would be something like (Ajay's age - 6) divided by 18 equals Rahul's age. Let me write that as an equation. Let me denote Ajay's age as A, Rahul's as R. So, (A - 6)/18 = R. That makes sense.\n\nThen the second part says: Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, whose age is 5 years. Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Denis's age is 5 years? Or is it that Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, and Denis's age is 5 years? Oh wait, the wording says, \"Denis whose age is 5 yrs.\" So that means Denis is 5 years old. And Rahul is two years younger than Denis. So Rahul's age would be 5 - 2 = 3 years? Wait, that seems really young. But let's go with it.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, the sentence says Rahul is 2 years younger to Denis whose age is 5 yrs. So, the structure is: Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, and Denis is 5. So Rahul is 5 - 2 = 3. Hmm, okay.\n\nSo Rahul's age R is 3. Now, going back to the first equation: (A -6)/18 = R. Since R is 3, substituting that in, we get (A -6)/18 = 3. Let's solve for A.\n\nMultiply both sides by 18: A -6 = 54. Then add 6 to both sides: A = 60. So Ajay's age is 60.

      "full_content": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about finding Ajay's present age based on some conditions involving Rahul and Denis. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the problem again to make sure I get all the details right. \n\nThe first part says: If 6 years are subtracted from the present age of Ajay and the remainder is divided by 18, then the present age of Rahul is obtained. So, mathematically, I think that would be something like (Ajay's age - 6) divided by 18 equals Rahul's age. Let me write that as an equation. Let me denote Ajay's age as A, Rahul's as R. So, (A - 6)/18 = R. That makes sense.\n\nThen the second part says: Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, whose age is 5 years. Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Denis's age is 5 years? Or is it that Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, and Denis's age is 5 years? Oh wait, the wording says, \"Denis whose age is 5 yrs.\" So that means Denis is 5 years old. And Rahul is two years younger than Denis. So Rahul's age would be 5 - 2 = 3 years? Wait, that seems really young. But let's go with it.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, the sentence says Rahul is 2 years younger to Denis whose age is 5 yrs. So, the structure is: Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, and Denis is 5. So Rahul is 5 - 2 = 3. Hmm, okay.\n\nSo Rahul's age R is 3. Now, going back to the first equation: (A -6)/18 = R. Since R is 3, substituting that in, we get (A -6)/18 = 3. Let's solve for A.\n\nMultiply both sides by 18: A -6 = 54. Then add 6 to both sides: A = 60. So Ajay's age is 60. Looking at the options, option B is 60.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because sometimes these problems can trick you. So, let's plug it back in.\n\nIf Ajay is 60, subtract 6: 54. Divide by 18: 54/18=3. Which is Rahul's age, correct. And Rahul is 3, which is 2 years younger than Denis who is 5. Yep, that all adds up.\n\nSo the answer should be 60, which is option B.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining Ajay's present age based on the given conditions. \n\n1. Let \\( A \\) represent Ajay's age and \\( R \\) represent Rahul's age. The first condition states that if 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's age and the remainder is divided by 18, the result is Rahul's age. This can be written as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{A - 6}{18} = R\n   \\]\n\n2. The second condition states that Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, whose age is 5 years. Since Denis is 5 years old, Rahul's age is:\n   \\[\n   R = 5 - 2 = 3\n   \\]\n\n3. Substituting \\( R = 3 \\) into the first equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{A - 6}{18} = 3\n   \\]\n   Multiply both sides by 18:\n   \\[\n   A - 6 = 54\n   \\]\n   Add 6 to both sides:\n   \\[\n   A = 60\n   \\]\n\nThus, Ajay's present age is 60. Verifying, if Ajay is 60, subtracting 6 gives 54, and dividing by 18 yields 3, which matches Rahul's age. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: B",

So, let me break that down. Let me denote Ajay's current age as A. So, if I subtract 6 from A, I get (A - 6). Then, when this is divided by 18, it equals Rahul's age. Let's say Rahul's age is R.

So, Denis's age is given as 5 years. Then Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis. So Rahul's age R = Denis's age minus 2. Wait, that can't be right because if Denis is 5, Rahul would be 3.

This gives the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{Aj} - 6}{18} = \\text{Rahul's age}.\n   \\]\n   Substituting Rahul's age (3 years) into the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{Aj} - 6}{18} = 3.\n   \\]\n4. **Solve for Aj**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Aj} - 6 = 3 \\times 18 = 54,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Aj} = 54 + 6 = 60.\n   \\]\n\nThus, Ajay's present age is **60 years**.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out Ajay's present age. Let's try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me read the question again carefully. The problem says that if 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's present age, and then the remainder is divided by 18, we get Rahul's present age. So, mathematically, that sounds like Rahul's age equals (Ajay's age minus 6) divided by 18. Hmm, I can write that as an equation: Rahul = (Ajay - 6)/18. \n\nThen, the next part says Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis. And Denis's age is given as 5 years. Wait, wait, Denis's age is 5 years? Or is that a typo? Because 5 years old seems a bit young if Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, but let's go with what's given.\n\nSo, if Denis is 5 years old, Rahul is 2 years younger. That means Rahul is 5 - 2 = 3 years old. Wait, no, that can't be right because 5 minus 2 is 3. But that would make Rahul 3. Let me double-check. The question says \"Denis whose age is 5 yrs.\" So, Denis is 5, Rahul is 2 years younger. So Rahul is 5-2=3.\n\nWait, that seems really young. Maybe I misread it. Let me check again. Oh wait, maybe I got the order wrong. It says Rahul is 2 years younger to Denis. So, Rahul's age = Denis's age minus 2. So yes, if Denis is 5, Rahul is 3. Okay.\n\nNow, going back to the first equation. Rahul's age is (Ajay's age -6)/18. So 3 = (A -6)/18, where A is Ajay's age. Let's solve for A.\n\nMultiply both sides by 18: 3 * 18 = A -6. 3*18 is 54. So 54 = A-6. Then add 6 to both sides: A=60.\n\nWait, so Ajay's age is 60? Let me check the options. Option B is 60. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's go through it again. \n\nDenis is 5. Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, so Rahul is 3. Then (Ajay -6)/18 = Rahul's age, which is 3. So Ajay -6 = 3*18 =54. Ajay =54+6=60. Yep, that's right.\n",
