      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these kinds of problems. But I'll take it step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says that a group of friends planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. But then four of them didn't show up, so the remaining ones had to each contribute Rs. 4 extra. I need to find out how many attended the picnic.\n\nHmm, let me think. So originally, all the friends were going to split the Rs. 96. Let's say the total number of friends was N. So each was supposed to pay 96 divided by N, right? So the original share per person would be 96/N.\n\nBut four didn't come, so the number of attendees became N - 4. Now, each of these attendees had to pay Rs. 4 more than they originally planned. So their new share is (96/N) + 4.\n\nBut wait, the new total amount to be collected is still Rs. 96 because that's what they planned to spend. So the number of attendees multiplied by the new share should equal 96. So, (N - 4) multiplied by (96/N + 4) equals 96.\n\nLet me write that equation down:\n\n(N - 4) * (96/N + 4) = 96.\n\nHmm, that's a bit complex. Let's try to simplify this. Maybe I can expand the left side.\n\nFirst, distribute (N -4) over the terms inside the parenthesis.\n\nSo, (N -4) * (96/N) + (N -4)*4 = 96.\n\nLet me calculate each part. \n\nThe first term is (N -4)*(96/N). Let me compute that: 96/N * (N -4) = 96*(N-4)/N. Which is 96*(1 - 4/N) = 96 - (384/N).\n\nThe second term is (N-4)*4 = 4N -16.\n\nSo adding both terms together: [96 - (384/N)] + [4N -16] = 96.\n\nCombine like terms. 96 -16 is 80. So 80 - (384/N) + 4N = 96.\n\nNow, subtract 96 from both sides: 80 -96 - (384/N) +4N = 0 \u2192 -16 - (384/N) +4N =0.\n\nLet me rearrange the terms: 4N - (384/N) -16 =0.\n\nHmm, this looks a bit messy. Maybe I can multiply both sides by N to eliminate the denominator. Let's try that.\n\nMultiply each term by N:\n\n4N * N \u2192 4N\u00b2\n-384/N * N \u2192 -384\n-16 * N \u2192 -16N\n\nSo the equation becomes: 4N\u00b2 -16N -384 =0.\n\nWait, let's double-check that multiplication. Oh wait, no, when I multiply each term by N:\n\n4N * N =4N\u00b2, correct.\n\n-(384/N) * N = -384.\n\n-16 * N = -16N.\n\nSo the equation is 4N\u00b2 -16N -384 =0.\n\nHmm, that's a quadratic equation. Let's see if we can simplify it. All terms are divisible by 4, so divide each by 4:\n\nN\u00b2 -4N -96=0.\n\nNow, I need to solve for N. The quadratic equation is N\u00b2 -4N -96=0.\n\nI can use the quadratic formula: N = [4 \u00b1 sqrt( (\u22124)^2 -4*1*(-96) ) ] / (2*1).\n\nCompute the discriminant: (\u22124)^2 is 16, and 4*1*(-96) is -384. So the discriminant is 16 + 384 = 400.\n\nSo sqrt(400) is 20. So,\n\nN = [4 \u00b120]/2.\n\nSo two possibilities:\n\n1) (4 +20)/2 =24/2=12.\n2) (4-20)/2= (-16)/2= -8.\n\nBut the number of people can't be negative, so N=12.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the number of those who attended the picnic, not the original number. Because four didn't attend, the attendees are N -4.\n\nSo N was 12, so attendees are 12 -4 =8.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 8.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake.\n\nOriginal plan: 12 people, each paying 96/12=8 Rs.\n\nAfter four didn't come, 8 people left. Each now pays (8 +4)=12 Rs.\n\n8 people paying 12 each is 8*12=96, which matches the total. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the number of attendees is 8, which is option A.\n",

So, let's say the total number of friends is N. But then, four of them didn't turn up, so the number of people who attended is N - 4.\n\nThe original plan was for each person to contribute an equal amount, right? So the cost per person would have been 96 divided by N. But since four people didn't come, each of the remaining had to pay Rs. 4 more. So the new cost per person is (96 / (N - 4)).\n\nWait, but the original cost per person was 96/N, and the new is 4 more. So I can set up an equation here.\n\nSo, the equation should be:\n\n(96)/(N - 4) = (96/N) + 4\n\nYes, that makes sense.

Let me compute each part carefully.\n\nFirst, 96*N is on the left. On the right, 96*(N-4) is 96N - 384. Then, 4*N*(N-4) is 4N\u00b2 -16N. So putting it all together:\n\n96N = (96N - 384) + (4N\u00b2 -16N)\n\nSimplify the right side: combine like terms. 96N -16N is 80N. So,\n\n96N = 80N - 384 + 4N\u00b2\n\nNow, subtract 96N from both sides to bring everything to one side:\n\n0 = (80N - 96N) - 384 + 4N\u00b2\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n0 = -16N -384 +4N\u00b2\n\nLet me rearrange it in standard quadratic form:\n\n4N\u00b2 -16N -384 = 0\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor out a 4 to simplify the equation.\n\n4(N\u00b2 -4N -96) = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\nN\u00b2 -4N -96 = 0\n\nNow, solving this quadratic equation. Let's use the quadratic formula. N = [4 \u00b1 sqrt( (4)^2 +4*96 ) ] / 2\n\nWait, the quadratic formula is N = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)] / 2a. Oh wait, no, wait: for ax\u00b2 +bx +c=0, it's (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)) / (2a).\n\nIn this case, a=1, b=-4, c=-96.\n\nSo, discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac = (-4)^2 -4*(1)*(-96) = 16 + 384 = 400.\n\nSquare root of 400 is 20.\n\nSo, N = [4 \u00b1 20 ] / 2.\n\nSo two possibilities:\n\n(4 + 20)/2 =24/2=12\n\n(4-20)/2= -16/2=-8\n\nBut N can't be negative, so N=12.\n\nSo the original number of friends was 12.

So if N=12, then the number who came is 8. Let me plug back into the original equation to see.\n\nOriginal per person cost: 96/12=8 Rs.\n\nAfter 4 didn't come, per person is 96/(12-4)=96/8=12 Rs.\n\nSo 12-8=4 Rs extra per person.

Oh wait, no, wait: for ax\u00b2 +bx +c=0, it's (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)) / (2a).\n\nIn this case, a=1, b=-4, c=-96.\n\nSo, discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac = (-4)^2 -4*(1)*(-96) = 16 + 384 = 400.\n\nSquare root of 400 is 20.\n\nSo, N = [4 \u00b1 20 ] / 2.\n\nSo two possibilities:\n\n(4 + 20)/2 =24/2=12\n\n(4-20)/2= -16/2=-8\n\nBut N can't be negative, so N=12.\n\nSo the original number of friends was 12. But the question is asking for the number of those who attended. Since 4 didn't show up, the number who attended is 12-4=8.\n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check. So if N=12, then the number who came is 8. Let me plug back into the original equation to see.\n\nOriginal per person cost: 96/12=8 Rs.\n\nAfter 4 didn't come, per person is 96/(12-4)=96/8=12 Rs.\n\nSo 12-8=4 Rs extra per person. Which matches the problem statement. So yes, the calculation is correct.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 8. So the answer should be A)8.\n\n\nThe problem involves a group of friends planning to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. Initially, the total number of friends is denoted as \\( N \\), and the cost per person was \\( \\frac{96}{N} \\). However, four friends did not attend, leaving \\( N - 4 \\) friends to share the cost. As a result, the new cost per person became \\( \\frac{96}{N - 4} \\), which was Rs. 4 more than the original cost per person.\n\nTo solve for \\( N \\), the following equation is set up:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{96}{N - 4} = \\frac{96}{N} + 4\n\\]\n\nMultiplying through by \\( N(N - 4) \\) to eliminate the denominators gives:\n\n\\[\n96N = 96(N - 4) + 4N(N - 4)\n\\]\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\n\\[\n96N = 96N - 384 + 4N^2 - 16N\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0 = 4N^2 - 16N - 384\n\\]\n\nDividing through by 4:\n\n\\[\nN^2 - 4N - 96 = 0\n\\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula \\( N = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), and \\( c = -96 \\):\n\n\\[\nN = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(1)(-96)}}{2(1)}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nN = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 384}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nN = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{400}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nN = \\frac{4 \\pm 20}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis gives two solutions: \\( N = \\frac{24}{2} = 12 \\) and \\( N = \\frac{-16}{2} = -8 \\). Since \\( N \\) cannot be negative, \\( N = 12 \\).\n\nThe number of friends who attended the picnic is \\( N - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 \\). Verifying, the original cost per person was \\( \\frac{96}{12} = 8 \\) Rs, and the new cost per person was \\( \\frac{96}{8} = 12 \\) Rs, which is Rs. 4 more per person, confirming the solution.\n\nThus, the number of friends who attended the picnic is **8**.\n\nAnswer: A",

Let's see what I can figure out.\n\nAlright, the problem says a group of friends planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. But then, four of them didn't show up. Because of that, the remaining friends had to each contribute Rs. 4 more than they originally planned. I need to find out how many attended the picnic.\n\nHmm, let's break it down. Let's say the total number of friends who were supposed to come is N. But four didn't come, so the number of attendees is N -4.\n\nOriginally, each person was supposed to contribute a certain amount. Let me call that amount x. So, the total cost would be N * x = 96. Because they planned to spend 96 Rs.\n\nBut since four didn't come, the remaining N-4 people had to cover the Rs. 96. So, the new amount each person has to pay is x +4. Because each contributes Rs.4 extra.\n\nSo, the equation would be (N -4) * (x +4) = 96.\n\nWait, but I have two equations here:\n\n1. N * x = 96\n2. (N -4) * (x +4) = 96\n\nSo, I can substitute x from the first equation into the second.

Let's use the quadratic formula. The equation is N\u00b2 -4N -96 =0.\n\nThe quadratic formula is N = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 384)] / 2.\n\nWait, because discriminant D is b\u00b2 -4ac. Here, a=1, b=-4, c=-96.\n\nSo, D = (-4)^2 -4*(1)*(-96) = 16 + 384 = 400.\n\nsqrt(400) is 20.\n\nSo,\n\nN = [4 \u00b120]/2.\n\nWe have two solutions:\n\n(4 +20)/2 =24/2=12,\n\nand (4-20)/2= (-16)/2= -8.\n\nBut N can't be negative, so N=12.\n\nWait, that's the number of friends originally planned, right?

Using the quadratic formula: N = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 384)] / 2\n\nBecause the equation is N\u00b2 -4N -96 =0, so a=1, b=-4, c=-96.\n\nDiscriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac = (16) + (4*96) = 16 + 384 =400.\n\nSo sqrt(400) is 20.\n\nSo N = [4 \u00b120]/2.\n\nWe can ignore the negative solution because number of people can't be negative.\n\nSo N = (4 +20)/2 =24/2=12.\n\nWait, but wait. So N is 12. That's the original number of friends. But the question is asking for the number of those who attended, which is N-4.\n\nSo N is 12, so attendees are 12-4=8.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 8. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, let me double-check.\n\nIf original N is 12, each was to pay 96/12=8 Rs. But four didn't come, so attendees are 8. Each now has to pay 96/8=12 Rs. So each pays 4 Rs extra. That's correct because 12-8=4. So yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the number of attendees is 8, which is option A.\n\n\nThe problem involves a group of friends planning to spend Rs. 96 on eatables, with each person contributing an equal amount. Initially, there were \\( N \\) friends, so the original share per person was \\( \\frac{96}{N} \\). However, four friends did not attend, leaving \\( N-4 \\) attendees. As a result, the new share per person became \\( \\frac{96}{N-4} \\), which was Rs. 4 more than the original share. This gives the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{96}{N-4} = \\frac{96}{N} + 4\n\\]\n\nRearranging and simplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{96}{N-4} - \\frac{96}{N} = 4\n\\]\n\n\\[\n96 \\left( \\frac{1}{N-4} - \\frac{1}{N} \\right) = 4\n\\]\n\n\\[\n96 \\cdot \\frac{4}{N(N-4)} = 4\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{384}{N(N-4)} = 4\n\\]\n\n\\[\n384 = 4N(N-4)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n96 = N(N-4)\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\nN^2 - 4N - 96 = 0\n\\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula \\( N = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) with \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), and \\( c = -96 \\):\n\n\\[\nN = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(1)(-96)}}{2(1)}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nN = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 384}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nN = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{400}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nN = \\frac{4 \\pm 20}{2}\n\\]\n\nTaking the positive root (since the number of people cannot be negative):\n\n\\[\nN = \\frac{4 + 20}{2} = 12\n\\]\n\nThus, the original number of friends was \\( N = 12 \\). Since four friends did not attend, the number of attendees is:\n\n\\[\nN - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of friends who attended the picnic is **8**, which corresponds to option A.\n\nAnswer: A",

I need to find out how many people attended the picnic.\n\nWait, let me break it down. So initially, they were expecting a certain number of people. Let's call that number 'n'. So each person was supposed to contribute 96 divided by n, right? Because the total cost is 96, so each person's share would be 96/n.\n\nBut then four people didn't come.

So the cost per person would have been 96 divided by N, right? So 96/N. But since four didn't come, the remaining (N-4) people had to cover the same total amount, so each had to pay more. \n\nHow much more? Each paid Rs. 4 extra. So the new amount each person paid is (96/N) + 4. But wait, that's not quite right. Because if originally each was to pay 96/N, and now each pays 4 more, then the new per person cost is (96/N) +4.

So:\n\n96 * N = 96*(N-4) + 4*N*(N-4)\n\nLet me expand the right side. Let's compute each part.\n\nFirst, 96*N is on the left. On the right, 96*(N-4) is 96N - 384.

Yes, that works.\n\nSo, the equation factors as (N -12)(N +8) = 0.\n\nSetting each factor to zero gives N=12 or N= -8. Since the number of people can't be negative, N=12 is the solution.\n\nWait, but N was the original number of friends who planned to attend. But the question asks for the number who attended, which is N-4. So 12-4=8. So the number of attendees is 8.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A is 8. So the answer should be A.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations.\n\nIf N=12, then the original share was 96/12=8 Rs per person.

So:\n\n0 = 4N^2 -16N -384\n\nWait, that's 4N\u00b2 -16N -384 = 0.\n\nHmm, this looks a bit messy, but maybe I can simplify it by dividing all terms by 4 to make the numbers smaller.\n\nDivide each term by 4: N\u00b2 -4N -96 = 0.\n\nNow, the equation is N\u00b2 -4N -96 =0.\n\nI need to solve this quadratic equation. Let me try to factor it, but if that's not easy, I can use the quadratic formula. Let's see if it factors.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -96 and add to -4. Let me think:  factors of 96 are 1 &96, 2&48, 3&32, 4&24, 6&16, 8&12. Hmm.\n\nLooking for two numbers that add up to -4. Let's see, maybe  -12 and 8: because -12 *8= -96, and -12 +8 =-4. Yes, that works.\n\nSo, the equation factors as (N -12)(N +8) = 0.\n\nSetting each factor to zero gives N=12 or N= -8. Since the number of people can't be negative, N=12 is the solution.\n\nWait, but N was the original number of friends who planned to attend. But the question asks for the number who attended, which is N-4. So 12-4=8. So the number of attendees is 8.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A is 8. So the answer should be A.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations.\n\nIf N=12, then the original share was 96/12=8 Rs per person. Four didn't come, so 8 people attended. Each now pays 96/8=12 Rs. The increase is 12-8=4 Rs, which matches the problem statement. Yep, that's correct.\n\n\nLet the original number of friends be \\( N \\). Since four did not attend, the number of attendees is \\( N - 4 \\). The total cost is Rs. 96, so the original contribution per person would have been \\( \\frac{96}{N} \\). After four friends did not attend, the new contribution per person became \\( \\frac{96}{N - 4} \\). According to the problem, this new contribution is Rs. 4 more than the original contribution. Therefore, the equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{96}{N - 4} = \\frac{96}{N} + 4\n\\]\n\nTo solve this, multiply both sides by \\( N(N - 4) \\) to eliminate the denominators:\n\n\\[\n96N = 96(N - 4) + 4N(N - 4)\n\\]\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\n\\[\n96N = 96N - 384 + 4N^2 - 16N\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[\n0 = 4N^2 - 16N - 384\n\\]\n\nDivide through by 4 to simplify:\n\n\\[\nN^2 - 4N - 96 = 0\n\\]\n\nFactor the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\n(N - 12)(N + 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nSince \\( N \\) cannot be negative, \\( N = 12 \\). The number of attendees is \\( N - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 \\). Verifying, the original contribution was \\( \\frac{96}{12} = 8 \\) Rs, and the new contribution was \\( \\frac{96}{8} = 12 \\) Rs, which is indeed Rs. 4 more per person. Thus, the number of attendees is 8.\n\nAnswer: A",

Let's see what the problem says.\n\nAlright, the problem is about a group of friends planning a picnic. They initially planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. But then, four of them didn't show up. Because of this, the remaining friends had to each contribute Rs. 4 extra. The question is asking how many people attended the picnic.\n\nHmm, okay. Let's break this down. Let me think about the variables involved. Let's say the number of friends who attended is x. Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, the total number of friends who were supposed to go is more than those who actually attended. Because four didn't come. So maybe I should define variables for the original number and the number that attended.\n\nWait, maybe I should let the total number of friends be N. Then, the number of attendees is N - 4, since four didn't come. But wait, no, that's not right. Because if N is the total number, and four didn't come, then the number that attended is N - 4. Wait, no, actually, if four didn't attend, that means the number who attended is N minus 4. Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Let's say the total number of friends who were planning to go is, say, T. So T includes those who came and those who didn't. So the number of attendees is T minus 4. Because four didn't turn up.\n\nWait, but the problem says four didn't turn up, so the attendees are T - 4.\n\nBut the initial plan was to split Rs.96 among all T friends. So each was supposed to pay 96 divided by T. But because four didn't come, the attendees became T - 4, so each had to pay 96 divided by (T-4) instead.\n\nAnd the problem states that this amount is Rs.4 more than the original share. So the original share per person was 96/T, and the new share is 96/(T-4), and this new share is 4 more than the original. So:\n\n96/(T - 4) = 96/T + 4.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the equation is 96/(T -4) equals 96/T plus 4.\n\nHmm, okay. So now I need to solve for T.\n\nLet me write that equation again:\n\n96/(T -4) = 96/T + 4.\n\nI can rearrange this equation to find T.\n\nFirst, subtract 96/T from both sides:\n\n96/(T-4) - 96/T =4.\n\nTo combine the left side, I'll find a common denominator. The denominators are (T-4) and T, so the common denominator is T(T-4).\n\nSo, [96*T - 96*(T-4)] / [T(T-4)] =4.\n\nLet me compute the numerator:\n\n96T - 96(T-4) = 96T -96T + 384 = 384.\n\nSo the equation becomes 384 / [T(T-4)] =4.\n\nMultiply both sides by T(T-4):\n\n384 =4*T(T-4).\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n96 = T(T-4).\n\nSo that's T squared minus 4T minus 96 equals 0.\n\nWait, wait, 96 = T^2 -4T.\n\nSo rearranged, T^2 -4T -96 =0.\n\nNow I need to solve this quadratic equation.\n\nThe quadratic formula is T = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 384)] /2.\n\nBecause the equation is T^2 -4T -96=0, so a=1, b=-4, c=-96.\n\nDiscriminant D = b\u00b2-4ac = (16) -4*(1)*(-96) =16 + 384=400.\n\nSo sqrt(400)=20.\n\nSo T = [4 \u00b120]/2.\n\nWe can ignore the negative solution because the number of people can't be negative.\n\nSo T = (4 +20)/2 =24/2=12.\n\nSo T is 12. So the total number of friends was 12. But wait, the problem is asking for the number of attendees, which is T-4, right?\n\nWait, because T is the original number, so attendees are T-4=12-4=8. So the number of people who attended is 8. Looking at the options, option A is 8.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nSo if the total number is 12, the original share per person would be 96/12=8 Rs. But four didn't come, so attendees are 8. So each now has to pay 96/8=12 Rs. Which is 4 Rs more than before.

So, the initial contribution per person is 96/N.\n\nBut four didn't come, so the number who attended is N - 4. Now, because of these four not coming, each of the remaining had to pay Rs.4 more. So their new contribution is (96/N) + 4.\n\nWait, but the total amount they have to spend is still Rs.96, right? Because that's what they planned. So, the new contribution per person multiplied by the number of attendees should equal 96.\n\nSo, the equation would be: (96/N + 4) * (N -4) = 96.\n\nHmm, let me write that down:\n\n( (96/N) + 4 ) * (N - 4) = 96.\n\nI need to solve this equation for N.\n\nLet me expand this equation. Let's compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, expand the left-hand side:\n\n(96/N)(N -4) + 4*(N-4) = 96.\n\nLet me compute each term.\n\nThe first term: (96/N)(N-4) = 96*(N-4)/N = 96*(1 - 4/N) = 96 - 384/N.\n\nThe second term: 4*(N-4) = 4N - 16.\n\nSo adding both terms together:\n\n96 - 384/N +4N -16 = 96.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(96-16) +4N -384/N =96.\n\nSo 80 +4N -384/N =96.\n\nNow subtract 96 from both sides:\n\n80 +4N -384/N -96 =0.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-16 +4N -384/N =0.\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\n4N -16 - 384/N =0.\n\nHmm, maybe multiply each term by N to eliminate the denominator. Let's do that.\n\n4N * N -16N -384 =0.\n\nWhich is 4N\u00b2 -16N -384 =0.\n\nNow, simplify this quadratic equation. Let's see if I can divide all terms by 4.\n\n4N\u00b2/4 = N\u00b2; -16N/4= -4N; -384/4= -96.\n\nSo, N\u00b2 -4N -96=0.\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation: N\u00b2 -4N -96 =0.\n\nI can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic is in the form aN\u00b2 +bN +c=0, where a=1, b=-4, c=-96.\n\nThe quadratic formula is N = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nDiscriminant D = (-4)^2 -4*(1)*(-96) = 16 + 384 = 400.\n\nSo sqrt(D) is sqrt(400)=20.\n\nSo, N = [4 \u00b120]/2.\n\nSo two solutions:\n\n(4+20)/2 =24/2=12.\n\n(4-20)/2 = (-16)/2= -8.\n\nBut number of people can't be negative, so N=12.\n\nWait, wait. But wait, N is the original number of friends. So 12 friends were supposed to come. But four didn't, so the number who attended is 12-4=8.\n\nWait, but let me check. Let me plug back into the original problem.\n\nIf N=12, then each was supposed to pay 96/12=8 Rs.\n\nBut four didn't come, so 8 people attended. Each now pays 8 +4=12 Rs.\n\nSo 8 *12=96. That works.\n\nSo the number of attendees is 8. Looking at the options, A is 8.\n\nWait, but let me check if N=12 is correct. Because the question is asking for the number of attendees, which is N-4=8.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option A)8.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nWait, when I set up the equation, I assumed that the initial contribution is 96/N. Then when four didn't come, the new contribution per person is 96/(N-4). But in the problem, it says each had to contribute Rs.4 extra. So the new contribution is (96/N) +4.\n\nWait a minute, that's where the equation came from. Let me confirm.\n\nYes, because the original contribution per person was 96/N. After four didn't come, each had to pay 4 more, so (96/N) +4.\n\nSo the total is (N-4)*(96/N +4) =96.\n\nWhich led to the equation. So the calculation seems correct. So N is 12, attendees are 8. So answer is A.\n\n\nThe problem involves a group of friends planning a picnic with a total expense of Rs. 96. Initially, they were supposed to split this cost equally. However, four friends did not attend, and as a result, each of the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra. The goal is to determine the number of friends who attended the picnic.\n\nLet the original number of friends be \\( N \\). The initial contribution per person was \\( \\frac{96}{N} \\). After four friends did not attend, the number of attendees became \\( N - 4 \\). The new contribution per person became \\( \\frac{96}{N} + 4 \\). Since the total expense remains Rs. 96, the equation governing the situation is:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{96}{N} + 4 \\right) \\cdot (N - 4) = 96.\n\\]\n\nExpanding and simplifying this equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{96(N - 4)}{N} + 4(N - 4) = 96,\n\\]\n\n\\[\n96 - \\frac{384}{N} + 4N - 16 = 96,\n\\]\n\n\\[\n4N - \\frac{384}{N} - 16 = 0.\n\\]\n\nMultiplying through by \\( N \\) to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n4N^2 - 16N - 384 = 0.\n\\]\n\nDividing the entire equation by 4:\n\n\\[\nN^2 - 4N - 96 = 0.\n\\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula \\( N = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), and \\( c = -96 \\):\n\n\\[\nN = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(1)(-96)}}{2(1)},\n\\]\n\n\\[\nN = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 384}}{2},\n\\]\n\n\\[\nN = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{400}}{2},\n\\]\n\n\\[\nN = \\frac{4 \\pm 20}{2}.\n\\]\n\nThis gives two solutions: \\( N = \\frac{24}{2} = 12 \\) and \\( N = \\frac{-16}{2} = -8 \\). Since the number of friends cannot be negative, \\( N = 12 \\).\n\nThe number of attendees is \\( N - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 \\).\n\nThus, the number of friends who attended the picnic is **8**, corresponding to option **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",
