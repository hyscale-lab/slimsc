      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a cyclist traveling at 12 miles per hour, and I need to find out how many minutes it will take to go 48 miles. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that time is equal to distance divided by speed. Yeah, that's the formula: time = distance / speed. So I can use that here. The distance is 48 miles, and the speed is 12 miles per hour. \n\nLet me plug those numbers in. So time = 48 miles divided by 12 mph. Wait, 48 divided by 12 is... let me calculate that. 12 goes into 48 four times because 12 times 4 is 48. So that gives me 4 hours. But wait, the question asks for minutes, not hours. Oh right, I need to convert hours to minutes.\n\nSince one hour is 60 minutes, I should multiply 4 hours by 60 to get the total minutes. 4 times 60 is 240 minutes. So that would be 240 minutes total.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 240. So that should be the correct answer. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\n48 divided by 12 is definitely 4. Then 4 hours times 60 is 240. Yep, that looks right.

So if the time is 4 hours, I multiply 4 by 60. Let me calculate that: 4 * 60 equals 240 minutes. So the cyclist will take 240 minutes to travel 48 miles.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 240. So that's the correct answer. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 12 mph times 4 hours gives 48 miles, which matches the problem. And 4 hours is indeed 240 minutes. Yep, that seems right.\n\n\nTo determine how many minutes it will take for the cyclist to travel 48 miles at a speed of 12 miles per hour, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{48 \\, \\text{miles}}{12 \\, \\text{mph}} = 4 \\, \\text{hours}\n\\]\n\nSince the question asks for the time in minutes, we convert hours to minutes by multiplying by 60:\n\n\\[\n4 \\, \\text{hours} \\times 60 \\, \\text{minutes/hour} = 240 \\, \\text{minutes}\n\\]\n\nThus, the cyclist will take 240 minutes to travel 48 miles. The correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: B**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a cyclist traveling at 12 miles per hour, and I need to find out how many minutes it takes to go 48 miles. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that speed is distance divided by time. The formula is speed = distance/time. So if I rearrange that, time equals distance divided by speed. That makes sense because if you go further, it takes more time, and if you go faster, it takes less time.\n\nSo the cyclist's speed is 12 mph. The distance is 48 miles. Plugging those into the formula, time should be 48 miles divided by 12 mph. Let me calculate that. 48 divided by 12 is 4. So the time is 4 hours.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the time in minutes. Oh right, I need to convert hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 4 hours times 60 minutes per hour is 240 minutes. So that's 240 minutes.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 240, so that must be the correct answer. Let me double-check. 12 miles per hour means in one hour, 12 miles. So in 4 hours, 12*4=48 miles. Yep, that's right.\n",
