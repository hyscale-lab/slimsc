      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a telephone bill that's partly fixed and partly varies with the number of calls. Hmm, I remember from math class that this is a linear cost model. So the total bill should be a fixed cost plus a variable cost per call.\n\nLet me see the data they gave. In the first month, there were 540 calls, and the bill was Rs.1800. Then in another month, 620 calls led to a bill of Rs.2040. I think I can set up two equations here to find the fixed cost and the variable rate per call.\n\nLet me denote the fixed cost as F and the variable cost per call as V. So the total bill would be F + V * number of calls.\n\nSo for the first month:\nF + V * 540 = 1800.  [Equation 1]\n\nAnd for the second month:\nF + V * 620 = 2040.  [Equation 2]\n\nI can subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 to eliminate F. That should help me find V.\n\nSubtracting:\n(F + 620V) - (F +540V) = 2040 - 1800\nSo, 80V = 240. Wait, because 620 -540 is 80, and 2040-1800 is 240. So 80V=240.\n\nDividing both sides by 80: V = 240 /80 = 3. So the variable cost per call is Rs.3.\n\nNow that I have V, I can plug it back into either equation to find F. Let's use Equation 1.\n\nF + 540*3 = 1800.\n540 *3 is 1620. So F +1620 =1800. Subtracting 1620 from both sides, F=1800-1620=180. So fixed cost is Rs.180.\n\nNow the question is, what's the bill when they used 500 calls? So it's F + V*500.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: 180 + 3*500. Let's calculate that. 3*500 is 1500. 1500 +180 is 1680. So the bill should be Rs.1680.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 1680. So I think that's the correct answer.\n",

Hmm, right, that means the total bill has two parts: a fixed cost that doesn't change no matter how many calls you make, and a variable cost that depends on the number of calls.\n\nThe problem gives me two scenarios. In the first month, 540 calls cost Rs.1800. The next month, 620 calls cost Rs.2040. And then in another month, they have 500 calls, and I need to find out the bill for that month.\n\nWait, so I think I can model this with a linear equation. Like, the total bill (B) is equal to a fixed cost (F) plus a variable cost per call (V) multiplied by the number of calls (C). So, B = F + V*C.\n\nI need to find F and V. Once I have those, I can calculate the bill for 500 calls.\n\nSo, using the first two months' data, I can set up two equations.\n\nFirst equation: 1800 = F + 540V\nSecond equation: 2040 = F + 620V\n\nHmm, right. So I have two equations with two variables. I can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate F.\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n(2040 - 1800) = (F - F) + (620V - 540V)\n240 = 80V\nSo V = 240 / 80 = 3.

Subtracting 1620 from both sides: F = 180.\n\nSo the fixed cost is Rs.180, and each call adds Rs.3.\n\nNow, for 500 calls, the bill would be F + 500*V.\n\nCalculating that: 180 + (500 * 3) = 180 + 1500 = 1680.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 1680.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about telephone bills. It says the bill is partly fixed and partly varies with the number of calls. Hmm, right, that means the total bill has two parts: a fixed cost that doesn't change no matter how many calls you make, and a variable cost that depends on the number of calls.\n\nThe problem gives me two scenarios. In the first month, 540 calls cost Rs.1800. The next month, 620 calls cost Rs.2040. And then in another month, they have 500 calls, and I need to find out the bill for that month.\n\nWait, so I think I can model this with a linear equation. Like, the total bill (B) is equal to a fixed cost (F) plus a variable cost per call (V) multiplied by the number of calls (C). So, B = F + V*C.\n\nI need to find F and V. Once I have those, I can calculate the bill for 500 calls.\n\nSo, using the first two months' data, I can set up two equations.\n\nFirst equation: 1800 = F + 540V\nSecond equation: 2040 = F + 620V\n\nHmm, right.

Let's see:\n\n(F + 620V) - (F + 540V) = 2040 - 1800\nSo, F - F cancels out. 620V -540V = 240V. And 2040-1800 is 240. So, 240V = 240. That means V = 240 / 240 = 1.

Let's use the first equation.\n\nF + 540 * 1 = 1800\nSo, F = 1800 - 540 = 1260. So the fixed cost is Rs.1260.\n\nWait, let me double-check that calculation. 540 * 1 is 540. 1800 minus 540 is indeed 1260. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo now, the bill structure is Fixed = 1260, Variable = 1 per call.

For 500 calls: 500*3 is 1500 plus 180 is 1680. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be B) Rs.1680.\n\n\nThe telephone bill consists of a fixed cost (F) and a variable cost (V) per call. The total bill can be modeled as:\n\n\\[\nB = F + V \\cdot C\n\\]\n\nUsing the two given scenarios:\n\n1. For 540 calls, the bill is Rs. 1800:\n   \\[\n   1800 = F + 540V \\tag{1}\n   \\]\n\n2. For 620 calls, the bill is Rs. 2040:\n   \\[\n   2040 = F + 620V \\tag{2}\n   \\]\n\nSubtracting equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate \\( F \\):\n\\[\n2040 - 1800 = (F + 620V) - (F + 540V)\n\\]\n\\[\n240 = 80V \\implies V = \\frac{240}{80} = 3\n\\]\n\nThe variable cost per call is Rs. 3. Substituting \\( V = 3 \\) into equation (1) to find \\( F \\):\n\\[\n1800 = F + 540 \\cdot 3\n\\]\n\\[\n1800 = F + 1620 \\implies F = 1800 - 1620 = 180\n\\]\n\nThe fixed cost is Rs. 180. For 500 calls, the total bill is:\n\\[\nB = F + V \\cdot C = 180 + 500 \\cdot 3 = 180 + 1500 = 1680\n\\]\n\nThus, the bill for 500 calls is Rs. 1680.\n\nAnswer: B",

Hmm, I remember from my math classes that this is a linear cost model, right? So the total bill should be something like a fixed cost plus a variable cost per call.\n\nThe problem gives me two scenarios. First, when there are 540 calls, the bill is Rs. 1800. Second, when there are 620 calls, the bill is Rs. 2040. And then we're asked to find the bill when 500 calls are made.\n\nLet me think about how to set this up. I'll probably need to find the fixed cost and the variable cost per call.\n\nLet me denote the fixed cost as F and the variable cost per call as V. So the total bill (B) can be written as:\nB = F + V * number_of_calls\n\nSo for the first case:\n1800 = F + 540V\nAnd for the second case:\n2040 = F + 620V\n\nHmm, okay, so I have two equations with two variables. I can solve these simultaneously to find F and V.\n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate F:\n2040 - 1800 = (F + 620V) - (F + 540V)\n240 = 80V\nSo, V = 240 / 80 = 3.\n\nWait, so each call costs Rs. 3? That seems right. Now I can plug V back into one of the equations to find F.\n\nUsing the first equation:\n1800 = F + 540*3\n540*3 is 1620. So 1800 = F + 1620\nSo F = 1800 - 1620 = 180.\n\nSo the fixed cost is Rs. 180 and each call is Rs. 3.\n\nNow, the question is for 500 calls. So the bill would be F + 500V.\n\nCalculating that:\n180 + 500*3 = 180 + 1500 = 1680.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations. 500 times 3 is 1500, plus 180 is 1680. That's option B.\n\nLet me make sure I didn't mix up any numbers. The first scenario: 540 calls give 540*3=1620, plus 180 makes 1800. Correct. Second scenario: 620*3=1860, plus 180 is 2040. That matches too. So yeah, the third case is 500*3=1500 + 180=1680. So the answer should be option B, 1680.\n",
