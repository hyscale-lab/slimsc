      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about discounts on tyres, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe manufacturer is giving a 20% discount on their tubeless tyres. Then some retailers are offering additional discounts. The question is, if a retailer gives an extra 20% discount, what's the total discount available at that retailer? The options are A to E, with some percentage numbers.\n\nHmm, I think this is a problem about successive discounts. So first, the manufacturer's discount, then the retailer's discount on top of that. But wait, I remember that when you apply two discounts successively, you can't just add them up. Because the second discount is applied after the first one has already reduced the price.\n\nLet me think about it with numbers. Suppose the original price of the tyre is $100. That makes the math easier.\n\nFirst, the manufacturer gives a 20% discount. 20% of 100 is 20, so the price becomes 80. So now the tyre costs $80.\n\nThen the retailer offers an additional 20% discount. Wait, but is this 20% of the original price or the already discounted price? I think it's the latter. So 20% of $80. 20% of 80 is 16. So subtracting that from 80, the final price is 64.\n\nSo the original price is 100, and after both discounts, it's 64. That means the total discount is 36% (because 100 - 64 = 36). But wait, the options don't have 36% as the answer yet. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are A)10%, B)25%, C)28%, D)30%, E)36%. Oh, option E is 36%, so that's the total discount. So the total discount isn't 40% (20+20), it's actually 36% because the second discount is applied to the reduced price.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The manufacturer's discount is 20%, so the customer pays 80% of the original price. Then the retailer gives another 20% off, which is 80% of the already discounted price. So the total price is 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64, which is 64% of the original. So the total discount is 100% - 64% = 36% discount. So the correct answer is E.\n\nAlternatively, another way to calculate it is by using the formula for combined discounts. If two successive discounts of x% and y% are applied, the total discount is not x + y, but rather (x + y - (xy/100))%. So in this case, x is 20 and y is 20. Plugging in: 20 + 20 - (20*20)/100 = 40 - 400/100 = 40 -4 = 36%. Yep, that's the same result.\n\nSo the options are E)36%.\n",

The manufacturer first offers a 20% discount, reducing the price to 80% of the original.

I think it's more complicated than that because the second discount is applied after the first one has already reduced the price.\n\nWait, right, so the first discount is 20% off the original price. Let's imagine the original price of the tyre is $100 for easy math. So after the manufacturer's discount, the price becomes 80% of the original. 20% off of 100 is 20, so 100 - 20 = 80. So the price after the manufacturer's discount is $80.\n\nNow, the retailer is offering an additional 20% discount on this already discounted price. So 20% of $80 is 16. So subtracting that from $80 gives me 64. So the final price is $64.\n\nWait, so the original price was $100, and after both discounts, it's $64. That means the total discount is 100 - 64 = 36. So the total discount is 36% of the original price.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the total discount available. So the answer is 36%, right? Looking at the options, E is 36%.\n\nWait, but I should double-check my math. Let me do it another way. The first discount is 20%, so the multiplier is 0.8. The second discount is another 20%, so that's another 0.8 multiplier. So overall, the price is 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 times the original. 0.64 is 64%, which means the total discount is 100% - 64% = 36%. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nSo the options are A)10%, B)25%, C)28%, D)30%, E)36%. So the correct answer is E.\n\n\nThe manufacturer offers a 20% discount, reducing the price to 80% of the original. If the original price is $100, the price after the manufacturer's discount is $80. The retailer then offers an additional 20% discount on this reduced price, which is 20% of $80, or $16. Subtracting this from $80 gives a final price of $64. The total discount is the difference between the original price ($100) and the final price ($64), which is $36. This represents a 36% discount of the original price. \n\nTo confirm, the discounts can also be calculated using multipliers: the first discount corresponds to a 0.8 multiplier, and the second discount corresponds to another 0.8 multiplier. Combining these gives a total multiplier of \\( 0.8 \\times 0.8 = 0.64 \\), meaning the final price is 64% of the original. Thus, the total discount is \\( 100\\% - 64\\% = 36\\% \\).\n\nThe correct answer is **E) 36%**.\n\nAnswer: E",

Hmm, the manufacturer is offering a 20% discount, and then some retailers are giving additional discounts. In this case, a particular retailer is offering an extra 20%. I need to find out what the total discount is.\n\nWait, I remember that when you have two successive discounts, you don't just add them up. Because the second discount is applied after the first one. So, for example, if something costs $100 and you have a 20% discount, that's $20 off, so it's $80. Then another 20% off on the new price. Oh right, because 20% of 80 is 16, so the total would be 80 minus 16, which is 64. So the total price after both discounts is $64, which is a total of 36% off from the original $100.\n\nWait, but how do I calculate that without using 100 as the base? Let me think. The first discount is 20%, so the remaining is 80% of the original price. Then the retailer gives another 20% off, so that's 80% of the already discounted price. So mathematically, it's 0.8 times 0.8, which is 0.64.

That must be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it: if both discounts are 20%, does that mean the combined discount is 40%? No, that's a mistake because the second discount is applied on the reduced price. So 20% off 80 is not the same as 80% of the original.

I remember that discounts don't just add up directly when they're applied successively. Like, if you have two discounts, you apply them one after the other, not add them.\n\nSo let's break it down. Suppose the original price of the tyre is $100. That makes the math easier. So, the manufacturer gives a 20% discount. 20% of 100 is 20, so the price after the manufacturer's discount is $80.\n\nNow, the retailer adds another 20% discount. But wait, is this 20% off the original price or off the already discounted price? I think it's off the already discounted price because that's how successive discounts usually work. So 20% of $80 is 16. So subtracting that from $80 gives $64.\n\nWait, the total amount paid is $64. The original was $100, so the total discount is 36% because 100 -64 =36. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, that's right. Because 36% of 100 is 36, so the total discount is 36%? But wait, I thought the answer might be 36%, but looking at the options, option E is 36%. So that's the total discount.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. So, first discount is 20%, so 80% of the original. Then another 20% off that, so 80% of the 80. So 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64. So the final price is 64% of the original. That means the total discount is 100% -64% =36%. So yes, the total discount is 36%, which is option E.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe the way the discounts are applied is different. Like, is the second discount 20% off the original, or off the reduced price? Because that would change things.\n\nIn the question, it says the manufacturer offers a 20% discount, and the retailer offers an additional 20%. So the retailer's discount is on top of the manufacturer's. So the first discount is 20% off the original, then the second is 20% off the already discounted price. So the way I did it earlier is correct.\n\nSo, the total discount is 36%, so the answer is E.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this question here about discounts on tyres, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe manufacturer is offering a 20% discount on tubeless tyres. Some retailers are adding their own discounts. The question is, if a retailer gives an additional 20% discount, what's the total discount available?\n\nHmm. I think this is about combining two discounts. But wait, how exactly do you combine them?
