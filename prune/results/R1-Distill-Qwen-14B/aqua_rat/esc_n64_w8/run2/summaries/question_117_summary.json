      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a business where three people\u2014A, B, and C\u2014invest different amounts at different times. I need to figure out how many months after B joined did C join. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nAlright, let me break down the information given. A starts the business with Rs.40,000. Then, after 2 months, B joins with Rs.60,000. C joins after some more time with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000. I need to find the time between B joining and C joining.\n\nI remember that in partnership problems, the profit is divided based on the capital multiplied by the time each person has invested. So each person's share is proportional to their investment multiplied by the duration they were in the business. \n\nLet me structure this. The total time of the business is 12 months. Let me denote the time each person invested as:\n\n- A: 12 months (since he started at the beginning)\n- B: He joined after 2 months, so he was in for (12 - 2) = 10 months.\n- C: He joined after some time after B. Let me call the time between B joining and C joining as 'x' months. So, C's investment period is (12 - 2 - x) months, because the business runs for 12 months. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If B joined after 2 months, and C joined 'x' months after B, then C's time in the business is (12 - 2 - x) months. Because 2 months have passed before B joins, then x months after B joins, so total time C is in is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model each person's investment period as:\n\nA: 12 months\nB: (12 - 2) = 10 months\nC: (12 - (2 + x)) = 10 - x months.\n\nWait, but wait: the way the question is phrased, it says C joined after \"some more time\" after B joined. So, after B joined, let's say C joined after x months. So, B was in for (10) months, but C was in for (10 - x) months. Wait, no: if B joined at 2 months, and C joined x months after B, then C's time is (12 - (2 + x)) months. Because the business runs for 12 months. So for example, if x is 2, C joins at 4 months and stays for 8 months.\n\nSo, the time periods are:\n\nA: 12 months\nB: 10 months\nC: (12 - (2 + x)) = 10 - x months.\n\nBut wait, x is the time after B joined that C joined. So, if x is zero, C joined right after B, so 2 months after start. If x is 3, C joined 3 months after B, so at 5 months from start, and is in for 7 months.\n\nOk, so each person's investment is multiplied by their time in the business. The profit is divided in the ratio of these products.\n\nSo, the profit ratio is:\n\nA:B:C = (40,000 * 12) : (60,000 * 10) : (120,000 * (10 - x)).\n\nBut wait, no. Because C's time is (10 - x) months. Let me write this more clearly.\n\nWait, let me think about the exact time each has their investment in.\n\nTotal time of the business is 12 months.\n\n- A's investment runs for 12 months.\n- B joined after 2 months, so B's investment runs for 10 months.\n- C joined x months after B. So the time between A starting and C joining is 2 + x months. Therefore, C's investment runs for (12 - (2 + x)) = 10 - x months.\n\nSo, the profit share is proportional to (capital \u00d7 time).\n\nSo, A's share: 40,000 \u00d7 12\nB's share: 60,000 \u00d7 10\nC's share: 120,000 \u00d7 (10 - x)\n\nThe total profit is 375,000. C's share is 150,000. So, the ratio of C's share to the total profit is 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4, which is 40%. So C's proportion is 40% of the total.\n\nAlternatively, we can model the profit ratios and then find x.\n\nLet me set up the equation. The ratio of C's profit to the total profit is equal to (C's investment \u00d7 time) / (sum of all investments \u00d7 their respective times).\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to find the ratio of the three shares.\n\nSo, the ratio of A:B:C is (40,000\u00d712) : (60,000\u00d710) : (120,000\u00d7(10 - x)).\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000\nB: 60,000 * 10 = 600,000\nC: 120,000 * (10 - x) = 1,200,000 - 120,000 x\n\nBut since C's share is 150,000, which is part of the total profit, perhaps I can compute the ratio and then find x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the ratios of A:B:C, then find the sum, and then express C's share in terms of that.\n\nWait, let me think: the total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. So the ratio of C's share to the total is 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4, which is 40%.\n\nSo, C's profit ratio is 40% of the total. So, the sum of all the profit ratios should be 100%, and C's is 40%.\n\nBut let me think in terms of the ratios. Let me denote the profit shares as:\n\nA's share: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000\nB's share: 60,000 * 10 = 600,000\nC's share: 120,000 * t, where t is C's time in the business.\n\nWait, but t = 10 - x, as established earlier.\n\nWait, no, C's time is (12 - (2 + x)) = 10 - x months. So, C's investment is 120,000 * (10 - x).\n\nSo, the total profit is sum of all shares: 480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(10 - x) = 375,000?\n\nWait no, because the total profit is 375,000, but the sum of the shares is 480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(10 - x) = 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000 x. Wait, that can't be. Because 480k +600k is 1,080k, plus 120k*(10 -x) is 1,200,000 - 120,000x. So total is 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 -120,000x = 2,280,000 - 120,000x. But the total profit is 375,000, which is way less than 2 million. That can't be right. Hmm, perhaps I've made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should model the profit ratio correctly. Because each person's share is proportional to their capital multiplied by the time they were invested. So, the ratio of their shares is:\n\nA : B : C = (40,000 * 12) : (60,000 * 10) : (120,000 * (10 - x)).\n\nLet me compute these:\n\nA: 40,000 *12 = 480,000\nB: 60,000 *10 = 600,000\nC: 120,000*(10 -x) = 1,200,000 - 120,000x\n\nBut wait, the sum of these is 480,000 +600,000 +1,200,000 -120,000x = 2,280,000 -120,000x. And the total profit is 375,000. So, that can't be. Because the sum of the ratios is 2,280,000 - 120,000x, but the actual profit is 375,000. So the ratio sum is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the ratio as the relative proportions, not the absolute values. Because the profit is distributed according to these ratios.\n\nSo, the total parts would be (A + B + C) in terms of their ratios. Let me compute the sum of A, B, C's ratios:\n\nSum = 480,000 + 600,000 + [1,200,000 - 120,000x] = 2,280,000 - 120,000x.\n\nBut the total profit is 375,000, which is equal to the sum of the shares. Wait, no, because the shares are based on the ratios, so the sum of the ratios equals the total profit.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because the sum of the ratios (A + B + C) is the total profit. So:\n\n480,000 + 600,000 + [1,200,000 - 120,000x] = 375,000 ?\n\nBut that would imply 2,280,000 - 120,000x = 375,000.\n\nWait, that's impossible because 2,280,000 is way larger than 375,000. So I'm making a mistake here.\n\nAh, I think I'm confusing the concepts. Let me try again. The profit is distributed in proportion to their investment-time products. So the sum of these investment-time products is the total \"units\" of profit. Then, each person's share is their product divided by the sum, multiplied by the total profit.\n\nWait, yes. So, the total units (let me call it 'total') is A's product + B's product + C's product.\n\nSo, total = (40,000 *12) + (60,000 *10) + (120,000 * (10 - x)).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n40,000 *12 = 480,000\n60,000 *10 = 600,000\n120,000 * (10 -x) = 1,200,000 - 120,000x.\n\nSo, total = 480,000 + 600,000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000x.\n\nSum these:\n\n480,000 +600,000 = 1,080,000\n\n1,080,000 +1,200,000 = 2,280,000\n\nSo, total = 2,280,000 - 120,000x.\n\nNow, C's product is 1,200,000 - 120,000x. His share is (1,200,000 - 120,000x)/total * 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nSo, let's set up the equation:\n\n( (1,200,000 - 120,000x) / (2,280,000 - 120,000x) ) * 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nLet me simplify this equation.\n\nDivide both sides by 375,000:\n\n( (1,200,000 - 120,000x) / (2,280,000 - 120,000x) ) = 150,000 / 375,000.\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4.\n\nSo,\n\n(1,200,000 -120,000x ) / (2,280,000 -120,000x ) = 0.4.\n\nLet me cross-multiply:\n\n1,200,000 -120,000x = 0.4 * (2,280,000 -120,000x )\n\nCompute the right side:\n\n0.4 *2,280,000 = 912,000.\n\n0.4 * (-120,000x) = -48,000x.\n\nSo,\n\n1,200,000 -120,000x = 912,000 -48,000x.\n\nLet me bring all terms to the left side:\n\n1,200,000 -120,000x -912,000 +48,000x =0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(1,200,000 -912,000) + (-120,000x +48,000x) =0.\n\n288,000 -72,000x =0.\n\n288,000 =72,000x.\n\nDivide both sides by 72,000:\n\nx= 288,000 /72,000 =4.\n\nSo x is 4 months.\n\nWait, x is the number of months after B joined that C joined. So C joined 4 months after B.\n\nWait, let me check the calculations again to be sure.\n\nSo, x=4.\n\nLet me plug this back into the equation to see if it holds.\n\nCompute C's product: 120,000*(10-4) =120,000*6=720,000.\n\nTotal units: 480k +600k +720k = 1,800,000.\n\nC's share is (720,000 /1,800,000) *375,000.\n\n720,000 /1,800,000 =0.4.\n\n0.4 *375,000=150,000. Which matches the given data. So yes, x=4.\n\nSo the time between B joining and C joining is 4 months. So the correct option is B)4 months.\n",

Therefore, C's investment runs for (12 - (2 + x)) = 10 - x months.\n\nSo, the profit share is proportional to (capital \u00d7 time).\n\nSo, A's share: 40,000 \u00d7 12\nB's share: 60,000 \u00d7 10\nC's share: 120,000 \u00d7 (10 - x)\n\nThe total profit is 375,000. C's share is 150,000. So, the ratio of C's share to the total profit is 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4, which is 40%. So C's proportion is 40% of the total.\n\nAlternatively, we can model the profit ratios and then find x.\n\nLet me set up the equation. The ratio of C's profit to the total profit is equal to (C's investment \u00d7 time) / (sum of all investments \u00d7 their respective times).\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to find the ratio of the three shares.\n\nSo, the ratio of A:B:C is (40,000\u00d712) : (60,000\u00d710) : (120,000\u00d7(10 - x)).\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000\nB: 60,000 * 10 = 600,000\nC: 120,000 * (10 - x) = 1,200,000 - 120,000 x\n\nBut since C's share is 150,000, which is part of the total profit, perhaps I can compute the ratio and then find x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the ratios of A:B:C, then find the sum, and then express C's share in terms of that.\n\nWait, let me think: the total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000.

Let me denote the profit shares as:\n\nA's share: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000\nB's share: 60,000 * 10 = 600,000\nC's share: 120,000 * t, where t is C's time in the business.\n\nWait, but t = 10 - x, as established earlier.\n\nWait, no, C's time is (12 - (2 + x)) = 10 - x months. So, C's investment is 120,000 * (10 - x).\n\nSo, the total profit is sum of all shares: 480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(10 - x) = 375,000?\n\nWait no, because the total profit is 375,000, but the sum of the shares is 480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(10 - x) = 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000 x. Wait, that can't be. Because 480k +600k is 1,080k, plus 120k*(10 -x) is 1,200,000 - 120,000x. So total is 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 -120,000x = 2,280,000 - 120,000x. But the total profit is 375,000, which is way less than 2 million. That can't be right. Hmm, perhaps I've made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should model the profit ratio correctly. Because each person's share is proportional to their capital multiplied by the time they were invested. So, the ratio of their shares is:\n\nA : B : C = (40,000 * 12) : (60,000 * 10) : (120,000 * (10 - x)).\n\nLet me compute these:\n\nA: 40,000 *12 = 480,000\nB: 60,000 *10 = 600,000\nC: 120,000*(10 -x) = 1,200,000 - 120,000x\n\nBut wait, the sum of these is 480,000 +600,000 +1,200,000 -120,000x = 2,280,000 -120,000x. And the total profit is 375,000. So, that can't be. Because the sum of the ratios is 2,280,000 - 120,000x, but the actual profit is 375,000. So the ratio sum is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the ratio as the relative proportions, not the absolute values. Because the profit is distributed according to these ratios.\n\nSo, the total parts would be (A + B + C) in terms of their ratios. Let me compute the sum of A, B, C's ratios:\n\nSum = 480,000 + 600,000 + [1,200,000 - 120,000x] = 2,280,000 - 120,000x.\n\nBut the total profit is 375,000, which is equal to the sum of the shares. Wait, no, because the shares are based on the ratios, so the sum of the ratios equals the total profit.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because the sum of the ratios (A + B + C) is the total profit. So:\n\n480,000 + 600,000 + [1,200,000 - 120,000x] = 375,000 ?\n\nBut that would imply 2,280,000 - 120,000x = 375,000.\n\nWait, that's impossible because 2,280,000 is way larger than 375,000. So I'm making a mistake here.\n\nAh, I think I'm confusing the concepts. Let me try again. The profit is distributed in proportion to their investment-time products. So the sum of these investment-time products is the total \"units\" of profit. Then, each person's share is their product divided by the sum, multiplied by the total profit.\n\nWait, yes. So, the total units (let me call it 'total') is A's product + B's product + C's product.\n\nSo, total = (40,000 *12) + (60,000 *10) + (120,000 * (10 - x)).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n40,000 *12 = 480,000\n60,000 *10 = 600,000\n120,000 * (10 -x) = 1,200,000 - 120,000x.\n\nSo, total = 480,000 + 600,000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000x.\n\nSum these:\n\n480,000 +600,000 = 1,080,000\n\n1,080,000 +1,200,000 = 2,280,000\n\nSo, total = 2,280,000 - 120,000x.\n\nNow, C's product is 1,200,000 - 120,000x. His share is (1,200,000 - 120,000x)/total * 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nSo, let's set up the equation:\n\n( (1,200,000 - 120,000x) / (2,280,000 - 120,000x) ) * 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nLet me simplify this equation.\n\nDivide both sides by 375,000:\n\n( (1,200,000 - 120,000x) / (2,280,000 - 120,000x) ) = 150,000 / 375,000.\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4.\n\nSo,\n\n(1,200,000 -120,000x ) / (2,280,000 -120,000x ) = 0.4.\n\nLet me cross-multiply:\n\n1,200,000 -120,000x = 0.4 * (2,280,000 -120,000x )\n\nCompute the right side:\n\n0.4 *2,280,000 = 912,000.\n\n0.4 * (-120,000x) = -48,000x.\n\nSo,\n\n1,200,000 -120,000x = 912,000 -48,000x.\n\nLet me bring all terms to the left side:\n\n1,200,000 -120,000x -912,000 +48,000x =0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(1,200,000 -912,000) + (-120,000x +48,000x) =0.\n\n288,000 -72,000x =0.\n\n288,000 =72,000x.\n\nDivide both sides by 72,000:\n\nx= 288,000 /72,000 =4.\n\nSo x is 4 months.\n\nWait, x is the number of months after B joined that C joined. So C joined 4 months after B.\n\nWait, let me check the calculations again to be sure.\n\nSo, x=4.\n\nLet me plug this back into the equation to see if it holds.\n\nCompute C's product: 120,000*(10-4) =120,000*6=720,000.\n\nTotal units: 480k +600k +720k = 1,800,000.\n\nC's share is (720,000 /1,800,000) *375,000.\n\n720,000 /1,800,000 =0.4.\n\n0.4 *375,000=150,000. Which matches the given data. So yes, x=4.\n\nSo the time between B joining and C joining is 4 months. So the correct option is B)4 months.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the profit distribution based on the capital invested and the time each partner was involved in the business. The profit is distributed proportionally to the product of capital and time for each partner. \n\n### Key Information:\n1. **A's investment**: Rs. 40,000 for 12 months.\n2. **B's investment**: Rs. 60,000 for 10 months (joined after 2 months).\n3. **C's investment**: Rs. 120,000 for \\(10 - x\\) months (joined \\(x\\) months after B).\n4.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this business problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of problems, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nAlright, the problem says that A starts a business with Rs.40,000. Then after 2 months, B joins with Rs.60,000. Then C joins some time after that with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. I need to find out how many months after B joined did C join.\n\nHmm, so it's a partnership problem where each partner contributes capital for a certain period. The profit is divided based on the product of the capital invested and the time period for which it was invested. So, each partner's share is proportional to their investment multiplied by the time they were in the business.\n\nLet me outline the timeline:\n\n- A starts alone with Rs.40,000.\n- After 2 months, B joins with Rs.60,000.\n- Then, after some more months, C joins with Rs.120,000.\n- The total time is one year, which is 12 months.\n\nWait, but each partner might have been in the business for a different number of months. So I need to calculate each partner's investment multiplied by the number of months they were in the business.\n\nLet me denote the time C joined after B as 'x' months. So, the total time each was in the business would be:\n\n- A was there for the entire 12 months.\n- B joined after 2 months, so he was there for (12 - 2) = 10 months. But wait, if C joined x months after B, then B's time would be 12 - 2 - x months? No, wait. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no. Let me model it correctly. The timeline is:\n\n- A starts at time 0 with Rs.40,000.\n\n- B joins after 2 months (so at time 2) with Rs.60,000.\n\n- C joins some time after B, say after 'x' months from when B joined. So C joins at time (2 + x) months.\n\nThen, the total time each was in the business:\n\n- A: from 0 to 12 months: 12 months.\n- B: from 2 to 12 months: 12 - 2 = 10 months. Wait, no. If C joined x months after B, then B's time is 12 - 2 = 10 months because the business runs for 12 months. Wait, no, because if C joined x months after B, then the time B was in the business is 12 - 2 = 10 months, regardless of when C joined. Because the business runs for 12 months.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me think of the periods each person contributed.\n\nA: 12 months.\n\nB: Joined after 2 months, so contributed for (12 - 2) = 10 months.\n\nC: Joined after (2 + x) months, so contributed for (12 - (2 + x)) = (10 - x) months.\n\nWait, but if C joins x months after B, then the time from when C joined to the end is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months. So C's time is 10 - x months.\n\nWait, but x is the time between B joining and C joining. So, for example, if x is 2 months, C joins 2 months after B, so at 2 + 2 = 4 months into the business. Then C's time is 12 -4 = 8 months.\n\nSo C's time is (10 - x) months.\n\nBut let's model it correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to denote the time C joined after B as 't' months. So, the time when C joined is 2 + t months after the start.\n\nThen, the time C was in the business is 12 - (2 + t) = 10 - t months.\n\nSo, A: 12 months.\n\nB: 10 months.\n\nC: (10 - t) months.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the business runs for 12 months. B joined after 2 months, so he was present for 10 months. C joined t months after B, so the time since the start is 2 + t months. So C's time in the business is 12 - (2 + t) = 10 - t months. So yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the profit is divided in the ratio of their investments multiplied by their time.\n\nSo, the profit share ratio is (A's investment * A's time) : (B's investment * B's time) : (C's investment * C's time).\n\nSo, the ratio would be:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12\n\nB: 60,000 * 10\n\nC: 120,000 * (10 - t)\n\nWait, but let's compute each term.\n\nA: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000\n\nB: 60,000 * 10 = 600,000\n\nC: 120,000 * (10 - t) = 1,200,000 - 120,000 t\n\nNow, the total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000.\n\nSo, the sum of all shares equals the total profit.\n\nSo, the sum of (A's share + B's share + C's share) = 375,000.\n\nBut since profit is divided in the ratio of their products, each person's share is their ratio multiplied by the total profit divided by the sum of all ratios.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the ratio of each person's contribution.\n\nLet me think in terms of their contributions:\n\nTotal contribution = A + B + C = [40,000 *12] + [60,000 *10] + [120,000*(10 - t)]\n\nBut wait, actually, the profit is divided based on the ratio of each person's (capital * time).\n\nSo the ratio R is:\n\nR_A : R_B : R_C = (40,000 *12) : (60,000 *10) : (120,000*(10-t)).\n\nWe can simplify these terms:\n\n40,000 *12 = 480,000\n\n60,000 *10 = 600,000\n\n120,000*(10-t) = 1,200,000 - 120,000 t.\n\nBut perhaps we can factor these numbers to make it easier.\n\nDivide each by 10,000:\n\n48 : 60 : (120*(10 - t)/10,000) \u2192 Wait, wait, 120,000 is 12*10,000, so 120,000*(10-t) is 12*(10-t)*10,000.\n\nWait, maybe I should represent each as multiples:\n\n480,000 : 600,000 : (1,200,000 - 120,000 t) \u2192 which can be written as:\n\n48 : 60 : (120 - 12 t) after dividing each by 10,000.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think differently.\n\nThe total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. So C's share is (150,000 / 375,000) = 1/2.5 \u2192 which is 2/5 of the total profit.\n\nWait, 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4 \u2192 which is 40% of the profit.\n\nWait, 40% is 2/5.\n\nSo, the ratio of C's contribution (120,000*(10 - t)) divided by the sum of all contributions should be equal to 0.4.\n\nAlternatively, C's share is (C's contribution) / (Total contributions) * total profit = 150,000.\n\nWait, let me model it as:\n\nC's share = [ (120,000*(10 - t)) / (40,000*12 + 60,000*10 + 120,000*(10 - t)) ] * 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nSo, let's set up the equation:\n\n(120,000*(10 - t)) / [ (40,000 *12) + (60,000 *10) + (120,000*(10 - t)) ] = 150,000 / 375,000.\n\nSimplify 150,000 / 375,000 = 1/2.5 = 0.4, or 2/5.\n\nSo:\n\n120,000*(10 - t) / [480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(10 - t)] = 2/5.\n\nLet me compute the denominator:\n\n480,000 + 600,000 = 1,080,000.\n\nSo denominator is 1,080,000 + 120,000*(10 - t) = 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000 t = 2,280,000 - 120,000 t.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n(120,000*(10 - t)) / (2,280,000 - 120,000 t) ) = 2/5.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n120,000*(10 - t) = (2/5) * (2,280,000 - 120,000 t )\n\nMultiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n5 * 120,000 (10 - t) = 2 (2,280,000 - 120,000 t )\n\nCalculate left side: 600,000 (10 - t) = 6,000,000 - 600,000 t.\n\nRight side: 2 * 2,280,000 = 4,560,000; 2*(-120,000 t) = -240,000 t. So right side is 4,560,000 - 240,000 t.\n\nSo equation is:\n\n6,000,000 - 600,000 t = 4,560,000 - 240,000 t.\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side.\n\n6,000,000 - 4,560,000 = 600,000 t - 240,000 t + ... Hmm, maybe move all terms to left.\n\n6,000,000 - 4,560,000 - 600,000 t + 240,000 t = 0.\n\nCompute:\n\n6,000,000 - 4,560,000 = 1,440,000.\n\n-600,000 t + 240,000 t = -360,000 t.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n1,440,000 - 360,000 t = 0.\n\nSo,\n\n360,000 t = 1,440,000.\n\nt = 1,440,000 / 360,000.\n\nt = 4.\n\nSo t is 4 months. Which is the time after B joined that C joined.\n\nWait, so the answer is 4 months after B joined. So the correct option is B)4 months.\n\nLet me cross-verify.\n\nSo, t =4.\n\nSo, C joined 4 months after B, which is 2+4=6 months after the start.\n\nC's time in the business is 12 -6=6 months.\n\nSo, C's investment is 120,000 for 6 months: 120,000 *6=720,000.\n\nA's contribution: 40,000 *12=480,000.\n\nB's contribution:60,000 *10=600,000.\n\nTotal contributions:480,000 +600,000 +720,000 = 1,800,000.\n\nC's share ratio is 720,000 / 1,800,000 = 0.4 \u2192 40% of 375,000 is 150,000. Which matches the problem statement.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the correct answer is option B)4 months.\n",

So C joins at time (2 + x) months.\n\nThen, the total time each was in the business:\n\n- A: from 0 to 12 months: 12 months.\n- B: from 2 to 12 months: 12 - 2 = 10 months. Wait, no. If C joined x months after B, then B's time is 12 - 2 = 10 months because the business runs for 12 months. Wait, no, because if C joined x months after B, then the time B was in the business is 12 - 2 = 10 months, regardless of when C joined. Because the business runs for 12 months.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me think of the periods each person contributed.\n\nA: 12 months.\n\nB: Joined after 2 months, so contributed for (12 - 2) = 10 months.\n\nC: Joined after (2 + x) months, so contributed for (12 - (2 + x)) = (10 - x) months.\n\nWait, but if C joins x months after B, then the time from when C joined to the end is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months. So C's time is 10 - x months.\n\nWait, but x is the time between B joining and C joining. So, for example, if x is 2 months, C joins 2 months after B, so at 2 + 2 = 4 months into the business. Then C's time is 12 -4 = 8 months.\n\nSo C's time is (10 - x) months.\n\nBut let's model it correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to denote the time C joined after B as 't' months. So, the time when C joined is 2 + t months after the start.\n\nThen, the time C was in the business is 12 - (2 + t) = 10 - t months.\n\nSo, A: 12 months.\n\nB: 10 months.\n\nC: (10 - t) months.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the business runs for 12 months. B joined after 2 months, so he was present for 10 months. C joined t months after B, so the time since the start is 2 + t months. So C's time in the business is 12 - (2 + t) = 10 - t months. So yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the profit is divided in the ratio of their investments multiplied by their time.\n\nSo, the profit share ratio is (A's investment * A's time) : (B's investment * B's time) : (C's investment * C's time).\n\nSo, the ratio would be:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12\n\nB: 60,000 * 10\n\nC: 120,000 * (10 - t)\n\nWait, but let's compute each term.\n\nA: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000\n\nB: 60,000 * 10 = 600,000\n\nC: 120,000 * (10 - t) = 1,200,000 - 120,000 t\n\nNow, the total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000.\n\nSo, the sum of all shares equals the total profit.\n\nSo, the sum of (A's share + B's share + C's share) = 375,000.\n\nBut since profit is divided in the ratio of their products, each person's share is their ratio multiplied by the total profit divided by the sum of all ratios.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the ratio of each person's contribution.\n\nLet me think in terms of their contributions:\n\nTotal contribution = A + B + C = [40,000 *12] + [60,000 *10] + [120,000*(10 - t)]\n\nBut wait, actually, the profit is divided based on the ratio of each person's (capital * time).\n\nSo the ratio R is:\n\nR_A : R_B : R_C = (40,000 *12) : (60,000 *10) : (120,000*(10-t)).\n\nWe can simplify these terms:\n\n40,000 *12 = 480,000\n\n60,000 *10 = 600,000\n\n120,000*(10-t) = 1,200,000 - 120,000 t.\n\nBut perhaps we can factor these numbers to make it easier.\n\nDivide each by 10,000:\n\n48 : 60 : (120*(10 - t)/10,000) \u2192 Wait, wait, 120,000 is 12*10,000, so 120,000*(10-t) is 12*(10-t)*10,000.\n\nWait, maybe I should represent each as multiples:\n\n480,000 : 600,000 : (1,200,000 - 120,000 t) \u2192 which can be written as:\n\n48 : 60 : (120 - 12 t) after dividing each by 10,000.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think differently.\n\nThe total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. So C's share is (150,000 / 375,000) = 1/2.5 \u2192 which is 2/5 of the total profit.\n\nWait, 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4 \u2192 which is 40% of the profit.\n\nWait, 40% is 2/5.\n\nSo, the ratio of C's contribution (120,000*(10 - t)) divided by the sum of all contributions should be equal to 0.4.\n\nAlternatively, C's share is (C's contribution) / (Total contributions) * total profit = 150,000.\n\nWait, let me model it as:\n\nC's share = [ (120,000*(10 - t)) / (40,000*12 + 60,000*10 + 120,000*(10 - t)) ] * 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nSo, let's set up the equation:\n\n(120,000*(10 - t)) / [ (40,000 *12) + (60,000 *10) + (120,000*(10 - t)) ] = 150,000 / 375,000.\n\nSimplify 150,000 / 375,000 = 1/2.5 = 0.4, or 2/5.\n\nSo:\n\n120,000*(10 - t) / [480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(10 - t)] = 2/5.\n\nLet me compute the denominator:\n\n480,000 + 600,000 = 1,080,000.\n\nSo denominator is 1,080,000 + 120,000*(10 - t) = 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000 t = 2,280,000 - 120,000 t.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n(120,000*(10 - t)) / (2,280,000 - 120,000 t) ) = 2/5.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n120,000*(10 - t) = (2/5) * (2,280,000 - 120,000 t )\n\nMultiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n5 * 120,000 (10 - t) = 2 (2,280,000 - 120,000 t )\n\nCalculate left side: 600,000 (10 - t) = 6,000,000 - 600,000 t.\n\nRight side: 2 * 2,280,000 = 4,560,000; 2*(-120,000 t) = -240,000 t. So right side is 4,560,000 - 240,000 t.\n\nSo equation is:\n\n6,000,000 - 600,000 t = 4,560,000 - 240,000 t.\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side.\n\n6,000,000 - 4,560,000 = 600,000 t - 240,000 t + ... Hmm, maybe move all terms to left.\n\n6,000,000 - 4,560,000 - 600,000 t + 240,000 t = 0.\n\nCompute:\n\n6,000,000 - 4,560,000 = 1,440,000.\n\n-600,000 t + 240,000 t = -360,000 t.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n1,440,000 - 360,000 t = 0.\n\nSo,\n\n360,000 t = 1,440,000.\n\nt = 1,440,000 / 360,000.\n\nt = 4.\n\nSo t is 4 months. Which is the time after B joined that C joined.\n\nWait, so the answer is 4 months after B joined. So the correct option is B)4 months.\n\nLet me cross-verify.\n\nSo, t =4.\n\nSo, C joined 4 months after B, which is 2+4=6 months after the start.\n\nC's time in the business is 12 -6=6 months.\n\nSo, C's investment is 120,000 for 6 months: 120,000 *6=720,000.\n\nA's contribution: 40,000 *12=480,000.\n\nB's contribution:60,000 *10=600,000.\n\nTotal contributions:480,000 +600,000 +720,000 = 1,800,000.\n\nC's share ratio is 720,000 / 1,800,000 = 0.4 \u2192 40% of 375,000 is 150,000. Which matches the problem statement.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the correct answer is option B)4 months.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the contributions of each partner and their respective time periods in the business. The profit is distributed based on the product of the capital invested and the time for which it was invested. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **A's Contribution**:  \n   A starts the business with Rs. 40,000 and remains in the business for the entire 12 months.  \n   Contribution = \\( 40,000 \\times 12 = 480,000 \\).\n\n2. **B's Contribution**:  \n   B joins after 2 months with Rs. 60,000 and remains in the business for \\( 12 - 2 = 10 \\) months.  \n   Contribution = \\( 60,000 \\times 10 = 600,000 \\).\n\n3. **C's Contribution**:  \n   C joins \\( t \\) months after B, i.e., at \\( 2 + t \\) months from the start. C remains in the business for \\( 12 - (2 + t) = 10 - t \\) months, investing Rs. 120,000.  \n   Contribution = \\( 120,000 \\times (10 - t) \\).\n\nThe total profit is Rs. 375,000, and C's share is Rs. 150,000. The profit is distributed in the ratio of the contributions. Thus, C's share fraction is:  \n\\[\n\\frac{C's \\, Contribution}{Total \\, Contribution} = \\frac{150,000}{375,000} = 0.4\n\\]\n\nThe total contribution is:  \n\\[\nTotal \\, Contribution = 480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000 \\times (10 - t)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting into the fraction for C's share:  \n\\[\n\\frac{120,000 \\times (10 - t)}{480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000 \\times (10 - t)} = 0.4\n\\]\n\nSimplify the denominator:  \n\\[\n480,000 + 600,000 = 1,080,000\n\\]  \n\\[\nTotal \\, Contribution = 1,080,000 + 120,000 \\times (10 - t)\n\\]\n\nSubstitute into the equation:  \n\\[\n\\frac{120,000 \\times (10 - t)}{1,080,000 + 120,000 \\times (10 - t)} = 0.4\n\\]\n\nMultiply through by the denominator:  \n\\[\n120,000 \\times (10 - t) = 0.4 \\times [1,080,000 + 120,000 \\times (10 - t)]\n\\]\n\nExpand and simplify:  \n\\[\n120,000 \\times (10 - t) = 432,000 + 48,000 \\times (10 - t)\n\\]  \n\\[\n120,000 \\times (10 - t) - 48,000 \\times (10 - t) = 432,000\n\\]  \n\\[\n72,000 \\times (10 - t) = 432,000\n\\]\n\nDivide:  \n\\[\n10 - t = \\frac{432,000}{72,000} = 6\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\( t \\):  \n\\[\nt = 10 - 6 = 4\n\\]\n\nThus, C joined the business 4 months after B. Verifying, C's contribution is \\( 120,000 \\times 6 = 720,000 \\), and the total contribution is \\( 480,000 + 600,000 + 720,000 = 1,800,000 \\). C's share fraction is \\( \\frac{720,000}{1,800,000} = 0.4 \\), which matches the given profit distribution.\n\n**Answer: B**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about partners in a business and figuring out how long after B joined did C join. Hmm, let's see. I remember that in such partnership problems, the profit is divided based on the amount of time each person invested their capital and the capital itself.\n\nSo, let's break down the information given. \n\nA starts the business with Rs.40,000. Then, B joins after 2 months with Rs.60,000. Then, C joins some time after B, but I don't know exactly when. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000. I need to find out how many months after B joined did C join.\n\nWait, so the total time is a year, which is 12 months. A started first, then B joined after 2 months, and C joined after some more months after B. So, I think the time each person's money was in the business is different.\n\nLet me structure this:\n\n- A's investment: Rs.40,000 for the entire year, so 12 months.\n- B's investment: Rs.60,000 for (12 - 2) months, because he joined after 2 months. So that's 10 months.\n- C's investment: Rs.120,000 for (12 - x) months, where x is the time from when B joined until C joined. Wait, no, wait. Because the total time is 12 months. So if B joined after 2 months, and C joined y months after B, then C's time in the business is (12 - 2 - y) months? Wait, maybe I should model this differently.\n\nLet me think again. Let me denote the time when C joined after B as t months. So, the timeline is:\n\n- A starts at month 0.\n- B joins at month 2.\n- C joins at month (2 + t). \n\nSince the business runs for 12 months, C's time in the business is (12 - (2 + t)) = 10 - t months. Because from month (2 + t) to month 12 is 12 - (2 + t) = 10 - t months.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So C's investment is for (10 - t) months.\n\nNow, the profit is divided in the ratio of their capital multiplied by the time they were in the business.\n\nSo, the profit sharing ratio is (A's capital * A's time) : (B's capital * B's time) : (C's capital * C's time).\n\nWhich would be:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12\nB: 60,000 * (10)\nC: 120,000 * (10 - t)\n\nWait, no. Wait, because A was there for 12 months, B for 10 months, and C for (12 - (2 + t)) = 10 - t months.\n\nSo, the profit ratio is:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12\nB: 60,000 * 10\nC: 120,000 * (10 - t)\n\nThe total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. So, the ratio of C's share to the total is 150,000 / 375,000 = 1/2.5, which is 0.4.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should compute the ratios and then find the proportion. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, the ratio of their profit shares is equal to the product of their capital and time. So, the share of C is 150,000, and the total is 375,000. So, the ratio of C's share to the total is 150,000 / 375,000 = 1/2.5, which is 0.4. So, 40% of the profit goes to C.\n\nSo, the ratio of C's (capital * time) to the sum of all (capital * time) should be 0.4.\n\nLet me compute the individual products:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000\nB: 60,000 * 10 = 600,000\nC: 120,000 * (10 - t) = let's call this 120,000*(10-t)\n\nSo, the total is 480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(10-t) = 480,000 + 600,000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000 t = 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000 t = 2,160,000 - 120,000 t.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me compute each step:\n\nWait, 480k + 600k = 1,080k. Then, 120,000*(10 - t) is 1,200,000 - 120,000 t. So, adding that to 1,080k:\n\n1,080,000 + 1,200,000 = 2,280,000. Then minus 120,000 t.\n\nSo, the total is 2,280,000 - 120,000 t.\n\nNow, the share of C is 150,000. The total profit is 375,000. So, the proportion of C's share is 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4.\n\nSo, the ratio of C's (capital * time) to the total is 0.4.\n\nSo, (120,000 * (10 - t)) / (2,280,000 - 120,000 t) = 0.4.\n\nLet me set up the equation:\n\n[120,000 (10 - t)] / [2,280,000 - 120,000 t] = 0.4\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\n120,000 (10 - t) = 0.4 [2,280,000 - 120,000 t]\n\nCompute 0.4 times each term:\n\n0.4 * 2,280,000 = 912,000\n\n0.4 * (-120,000 t) = -48,000 t\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n120,000 (10 - t) = 912,000 - 48,000 t\n\nExpand left side:\n\n1,200,000 - 120,000 t = 912,000 - 48,000 t\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n1,200,000 - 120,000 t - 912,000 + 48,000 t = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(1,200,000 - 912,000) + (-120,000 t +48,000 t) = 0\n\n288,000 -72,000 t = 0\n\nSo,\n\n-72,000 t = -288,000\n\nDivide both sides by -72,000:\n\nt = (-288,000)/(-72,000) = 4.\n\nSo, t is 4 months. Wait, that's the time after B joined that C joined. So the answer would be 4 months, which is option B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the math to avoid mistakes.\n\nLet me recompute the equation:\n\n120,000 (10 - t) = 0.4 * (2,280,000 - 120,000 t)\n\nCompute right side:\n\n0.4 * 2,280,000 = 912,000\n\n0.4 * (-120,000 t) = -48,000 t\n\nSo, 912,000 -48,000 t.\n\nLeft side: 1,200,000 -120,000 t.\n\nSo,\n\n1,200,000 -120,000 t = 912,000 -48,000 t\n\nSubtract 912,000 from both sides:\n\n288,000 -120,000 t = -48,000 t\n\nAdd 120,000 t to both sides:\n\n288,000 = 72,000 t\n\nt = 288,000 / 72,000 = 4.\n\nYes, correct. So, t is 4 months. So the answer is B)4 months.\n",

A started first, then B joined after 2 months, and C joined after some more months after B. So, I think the time each person's money was in the business is different.\n\nLet me structure this:\n\n- A's investment: Rs.40,000 for the entire year, so 12 months.\n- B's investment: Rs.60,000 for (12 - 2) months, because he joined after 2 months. So that's 10 months.\n- C's investment: Rs.120,000 for (12 - x) months, where x is the time from when B joined until C joined. Wait, no, wait. Because the total time is 12 months. So if B joined after 2 months, and C joined y months after B, then C's time in the business is (12 - 2 - y) months? Wait, maybe I should model this differently.\n\nLet me think again. Let me denote the time when C joined after B as t months. So, the timeline is:\n\n- A starts at month 0.\n- B joins at month 2.\n- C joins at month (2 + t). \n\nSince the business runs for 12 months, C's time in the business is (12 - (2 + t)) = 10 - t months. Because from month (2 + t) to month 12 is 12 - (2 + t) = 10 - t months.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So C's investment is for (10 - t) months.\n\nNow, the profit is divided in the ratio of their capital multiplied by the time they were in the business.\n\nSo, the profit sharing ratio is (A's capital * A's time) : (B's capital * B's time) : (C's capital * C's time).\n\nWhich would be:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12\nB: 60,000 * (10)\nC: 120,000 * (10 - t)\n\nWait, no. Wait, because A was there for 12 months, B for 10 months, and C for (12 - (2 + t)) = 10 - t months.\n\nSo, the profit ratio is:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12\nB: 60,000 * 10\nC: 120,000 * (10 - t)\n\nThe total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. So, the ratio of C's share to the total is 150,000 / 375,000 = 1/2.5, which is 0.4.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should compute the ratios and then find the proportion. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, the ratio of their profit shares is equal to the product of their capital and time. So, the share of C is 150,000, and the total is 375,000. So, the ratio of C's share to the total is 150,000 / 375,000 = 1/2.5, which is 0.4. So, 40% of the profit goes to C.\n\nSo, the ratio of C's (capital * time) to the sum of all (capital * time) should be 0.4.\n\nLet me compute the individual products:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000\nB: 60,000 * 10 = 600,000\nC: 120,000 * (10 - t) = let's call this 120,000*(10-t)\n\nSo, the total is 480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(10-t) = 480,000 + 600,000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000 t = 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000 t = 2,160,000 - 120,000 t.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me compute each step:\n\nWait, 480k + 600k = 1,080k. Then, 120,000*(10 - t) is 1,200,000 - 120,000 t. So, adding that to 1,080k:\n\n1,080,000 + 1,200,000 = 2,280,000. Then minus 120,000 t.\n\nSo, the total is 2,280,000 - 120,000 t.\n\nNow, the share of C is 150,000. The total profit is 375,000. So, the proportion of C's share is 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4.\n\nSo, the ratio of C's (capital * time) to the total is 0.4.\n\nSo, (120,000 * (10 - t)) / (2,280,000 - 120,000 t) = 0.4.\n\nLet me set up the equation:\n\n[120,000 (10 - t)] / [2,280,000 - 120,000 t] = 0.4\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\n120,000 (10 - t) = 0.4 [2,280,000 - 120,000 t]\n\nCompute 0.4 times each term:\n\n0.4 * 2,280,000 = 912,000\n\n0.4 * (-120,000 t) = -48,000 t\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n120,000 (10 - t) = 912,000 - 48,000 t\n\nExpand left side:\n\n1,200,000 - 120,000 t = 912,000 - 48,000 t\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n1,200,000 - 120,000 t - 912,000 + 48,000 t = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(1,200,000 - 912,000) + (-120,000 t +48,000 t) = 0\n\n288,000 -72,000 t = 0\n\nSo,\n\n-72,000 t = -288,000\n\nDivide both sides by -72,000:\n\nt = (-288,000)/(-72,000) = 4.\n\nSo, t is 4 months. Wait, that's the time after B joined that C joined. So the answer would be 4 months, which is option B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the math to avoid mistakes.\n\nLet me recompute the equation:\n\n120,000 (10 - t) = 0.4 * (2,280,000 - 120,000 t)\n\nCompute right side:\n\n0.4 * 2,280,000 = 912,000\n\n0.4 * (-120,000 t) = -48,000 t\n\nSo, 912,000 -48,000 t.\n\nLeft side: 1,200,000 -120,000 t.\n\nSo,\n\n1,200,000 -120,000 t = 912,000 -48,000 t\n\nSubtract 912,000 from both sides:\n\n288,000 -120,000 t = -48,000 t\n\nAdd 120,000 t to both sides:\n\n288,000 = 72,000 t\n\nt = 288,000 / 72,000 = 4.\n\nYes, correct. So, t is 4 months. So the answer is B)4 months.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we calculate the profit-sharing ratio based on the capital and time each partner invested. \n\n### Step 1: Define the timeline and investments\n- **A** starts the business with **Rs. 40,000** and remains for the entire **12 months**.\n- **B** joins after **2 months** with **Rs. 60,000** and remains for **10 months**.\n- **C** joins **t months** after B (i.e., at month **2 + t**) and remains for **10 - t months**.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the profit-sharing ratio\nThe profit is divided based on the product of capital and time:\n- **A's share**: \\( 40,000 \\times 12 = 480,000 \\)\n- **B's share**: \\( 60,000 \\times 10 = 600,000 \\)\n- **C's share**: \\( 120,000 \\times (10 - t) = 1,200,000 - 120,000t \\)\n\nThe total profit is **Rs. 375,000**, and **C's share** is **Rs. 150,000**.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about three people starting a business together, and I need to figure out when C joined after B. Let's try to break it down step by step.\n\nSo, A starts with Rs.40,000. Then, after 2 months, B joins with Rs.60,000. Then, some time later, C joins with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000. I need to find out how many months after B joined did C join.\n\nHmm, profit sharing in partnerships is usually based on the amount of capital invested and the time for which it's invested. So, each partner's share is proportional to their capital multiplied by the time they were in the business.\n\nLet me structure the timeline. The business runs for a total of 12 months. Let's think about each person's investment period.\n\nA invested Rs.40,000 for the entire 12 months. So A's contribution is 40,000 * 12.\n\nB joined after 2 months, so B's investment period is 12 - 2 = 10 months. So B's contribution is 60,000 * 10.\n\nC joined after B, but we don't know how many months after. Let's say C joined x months after B. Since B joined at month 2, C joined at month (2 + x). So the time C was in the business is (12 - (2 + x)) = 10 - x months. So C's contribution is 120,000 * (10 - x).\n\nWait, but the problem says C joined after some more time. So C's time in the business is 12 minus the month he joined. So if he joined t months after A started, then his time is 12 - t.\n\nWait, maybe I should model it differently. Let me think in terms of when each person joined.\n\nA starts at month 0. B joins at month 2. C joins at month 2 + x, where x is the number of months after B joined. So the time each person's money was in the business is:\n\nA: 12 months.\n\nB: 12 - 2 = 10 months.\n\nC: 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months.\n\nWait, but if x is the number of months after B joined, then C's time is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x. But x can't be more than 10 because C has to join before the end of the year.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think about the time each person's investment was active. Let's define:\n\n- A's investment: 40,000 for 12 months.\n\n- B's investment: 60,000 for (12 - 2) = 10 months.\n\n- C's investment: 120,000 for (12 - t) months, where t is the month when C joined.\n\nBut t is 2 + x, where x is the months after B joined. So t = 2 + x. So C's time is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should model it as each person's investment multiplied by their duration. Then, the profit is divided based on the product of capital and time.\n\nSo the total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. So the ratio of C's share to the total profit is 150,000 / 375,000 = 1/2.5 = 2/5. So C's share is 2/5 of the total profit.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because profit is distributed according to each partner's contribution, which is capital multiplied by time. So the total contribution is the sum of each partner's (capital * time), and each partner's share is their (capital * time) divided by the total.\n\nSo let's compute each person's contribution:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000.\n\nB: 60,000 * (10) = 600,000.\n\nC: 120,000 * (10 - x) = 120,000 * (12 - t), where t is when C joined. But t = 2 + x, so 12 - t = 10 - x.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let's assign variables more clearly.\n\nLet\u2019s define t as the number of months after B joined that C joined. So C joined t months after B. Since B joined at month 2, C joined at month (2 + t). So the time C was in the business is 12 - (2 + t) = 10 - t months.\n\nSo C's contribution is 120,000 * (10 - t).\n\nThe profit is divided based on the ratio of each partner's (capital * time). So the ratio is:\n\nA : B : C = (40,000 * 12) : (60,000 * 10) : (120,000 * (10 - t)).\n\nLet me compute each:\n\nA's part: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000.\n\nB's part: 60,000 * 10 = 600,000.\n\nC's part: 120,000 * (10 - t) = 1,200,000 - 120,000 t.\n\nThe total profit is 375,000. C's share is 150,000, which is (150,000 / 375,000) = 0.4 or 40% of the total profit.\n\nBut wait, no. The profit is distributed based on their contributions, so each person's share is their contribution divided by the total contribution.\n\nSo the total contribution is sum of all parts.\n\nTotal = 480,000 + 600,000 + (1,200,000 - 120,000 t) = 480k + 600k + 1.2M - 120k t.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n480,000 + 600,000 = 1,080,000.\n\n1,080,000 + 1,200,000 = 2,280,000.\n\nSo total = 2,280,000 - 120,000 t.\n\nC's share is (1,200,000 - 120,000 t) / (2,280,000 - 120,000 t) = 150,000 / 375,000.\n\nWait, because C's share of the profit is 150,000, which is (C's contribution) / (total contribution) * total profit.\n\nSo 150,000 = (1,200,000 - 120,000 t) / (2,280,000 - 120,000 t) * 375,000.\n\nLet me write that as an equation:\n\n(1,200,000 - 120,000 t) / (2,280,000 - 120,000 t) = 150,000 / 375,000.\n\nSimplify the right side: 150,000 / 375,000 = 1/2.5 = 2/5.\n\nSo:\n\n(1,200,000 - 120,000 t) / (2,280,000 - 120,000 t) = 2/5.\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n5*(1,200,000 - 120,000 t) = 2*(2,280,000 - 120,000 t).\n\nCompute each side:\n\nLeft: 5*1,200,000 = 6,000,000; 5*(-120,000 t) = -600,000 t. So left is 6,000,000 - 600,000 t.\n\nRight: 2*2,280,000 = 4,560,000; 2*(-120,000 t) = -240,000 t. So right is 4,560,000 - 240,000 t.\n\nNow, set equation:\n\n6,000,000 - 600,000 t = 4,560,000 - 240,000 t.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n6,000,000 - 4,560,000 = 600,000 t - 240,000 t.\n\n1,440,000 = 360,000 t.\n\nSo t = 1,440,000 / 360,000 = 4.\n\nWait, so t is 4 months. So C joined 4 months after B. So the answer is 4 months. Looking at the options, option B is 4 months.\n",

So the time C was in the business is 12 - (2 + t) = 10 - t months.\n\nSo C's contribution is 120,000 * (10 - t).\n\nThe profit is divided based on the ratio of each partner's (capital * time). So the ratio is:\n\nA : B : C = (40,000 * 12) : (60,000 * 10) : (120,000 * (10 - t)).\n\nLet me compute each:\n\nA's part: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000.\n\nB's part: 60,000 * 10 = 600,000.\n\nC's part: 120,000 * (10 - t) = 1,200,000 - 120,000 t.\n\nThe total profit is 375,000. C's share is 150,000, which is (150,000 / 375,000) = 0.4 or 40% of the total profit.\n\nBut wait, no. The profit is distributed based on their contributions, so each person's share is their contribution divided by the total contribution.\n\nSo the total contribution is sum of all parts.\n\nTotal = 480,000 + 600,000 + (1,200,000 - 120,000 t) = 480k + 600k + 1.2M - 120k t.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n480,000 + 600,000 = 1,080,000.\n\n1,080,000 + 1,200,000 = 2,280,000.\n\nSo total = 2,280,000 - 120,000 t.\n\nC's share is (1,200,000 - 120,000 t) / (2,280,000 - 120,000 t) = 150,000 / 375,000.\n\nWait, because C's share of the profit is 150,000, which is (C's contribution) / (total contribution) * total profit.\n\nSo 150,000 = (1,200,000 - 120,000 t) / (2,280,000 - 120,000 t) * 375,000.\n\nLet me write that as an equation:\n\n(1,200,000 - 120,000 t) / (2,280,000 - 120,000 t) = 150,000 / 375,000.\n\nSimplify the right side: 150,000 / 375,000 = 1/2.5 = 2/5.\n\nSo:\n\n(1,200,000 - 120,000 t) / (2,280,000 - 120,000 t) = 2/5.\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n5*(1,200,000 - 120,000 t) = 2*(2,280,000 - 120,000 t).\n\nCompute each side:\n\nLeft: 5*1,200,000 = 6,000,000; 5*(-120,000 t) = -600,000 t. So left is 6,000,000 - 600,000 t.\n\nRight: 2*2,280,000 = 4,560,000; 2*(-120,000 t) = -240,000 t. So right is 4,560,000 - 240,000 t.\n\nNow, set equation:\n\n6,000,000 - 600,000 t = 4,560,000 - 240,000 t.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n6,000,000 - 4,560,000 = 600,000 t - 240,000 t.\n\n1,440,000 = 360,000 t.\n\nSo t = 1,440,000 / 360,000 = 4.\n\nWait, so t is 4 months. So C joined 4 months after B. So the answer is 4 months. Looking at the options, option B is 4 months.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the profit-sharing ratio based on the capital invested and the time each partner was in the business. \n\n1. **Timeline of Investments**:\n   - A starts the business with Rs.40,000 and remains in the business for the entire 12 months.\n   - B joins after 2 months with Rs.60,000 and stays for \\(12 - 2 = 10\\) months.\n   - C joins after \\(t\\) months from when B joined (i.e., at month \\(2 + t\\)) and stays for \\(12 - (2 + t) = 10 - t\\) months.\n\n2. **Profit-Sharing Contribution**:\n   - A's contribution: \\(40,000 \\times 12 = 480,000\\).\n   - B's contribution: \\(60,000 \\times 10 = 600,000\\).\n   - C's contribution: \\(120,000 \\times (10 - t) = 1,200,000 - 120,000t\\).\n\n3. **Total Contribution**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Contribution} = 480,000 + 600,000 + (1,200,000 - 120,000t) = 2,280,000 - 120,000t.\n   \\]\n\n4. **C's Share of Profit**:\n   C's share of the total profit is given as Rs.150,000 out of Rs.375,000, which corresponds to:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{150,000}{375,000} = \\frac{2}{5}.\n   \\]\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1,200,000 - 120,000t}{2,280,000 - 120,000t} = \\frac{2}{5}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solving for \\(t\\)**:\n   Cross-multiplying:\n   \\[\n   5(1,200,000 - 120,000t) = 2(2,280,000 - 120,000t).\n   \\]\n   Simplify:\n   \\[\n   6,000,000 - 600,000t = 4,560,000 - 240,000t.\n   \\]\n   Rearranging:\n   \\[\n   1,440,000 = 360,000t.\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\(t\\):\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{1,440,000}{360,000} = 4.\n   \\]\n\nThus, C joined 4 months after B. \n\n**Answer: B**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about partners in a business and how their investments and the time they've been involved affect their share of the profit. Hmm, right, I remember that in such partnership problems, the profit is divided based on the product of the capital invested and the time for which it's invested. So it's like, the more money you put in and the longer you stay, the bigger your share.\n\nSo the setup is: A starts the business with Rs.40,000. Then after 2 months, B joins with Rs.60,000. Then some time later, C joins with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000. We need to find out how many months after B joined did C join.\n\nLet me break this down. The business runs for a year, which is 12 months. Let me assign variables to the time each person invested their capital.\n\nA started first, so he was there for the entire 12 months. So A's investment period is 12 months.\n\nB joined after 2 months, so he started in month 3. But we don't know when C joined. Let's say C joined 'x' months after B joined. Wait, but the question is asking how many months after B joined did C join. So if B joined at month 2, then C joined at month (2 + x). But wait, the time each person's investment is in the business would be (12 - (month they joined)).\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the duration each person's investment was active. Let me clarify:\n\n- A's duration: 12 months (since he started at the beginning)\n- B's duration: let's see, he joined after 2 months, so he invested for (12 - 2) = 10 months.\n- C's duration: he joined after B, but how much later? Let's say C joined 't' months after B. So, the time C was in the business is (12 - (2 + t)) months. Because the total time is 12 months.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is phrased, after some time B joined, then after some more time C joined. So the time between when B joined and when C joined is what we're looking for. Let me define the variables more precisely.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- A's investment: 40,000 for 12 months.\n- B's investment: 60,000 for (12 - 2) = 10 months. Because B joined after 2 months.\n- C's investment: 120,000 for (12 - (2 + x)) months, where x is the number of months after B joined that C joined. So the time C invested is (10 - x) months. Because 2 months passed before B joined, then x months after that C joined, so the time from C's joining to the end is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months.\n\nWait, no. Because the entire duration is 12 months. So if C joined 'x' months after B, then C's investment period is (12 - (2 + x)) = (10 - x) months.\n\nSo, their profit shares are proportional to their (capital \u00d7 time). So the profit ratio will be A:B:C = 40000\u00d712 : 60000\u00d7(10) : 120000\u00d7(10 - x).\n\nWait, but wait, C's time is (12 - (2 + x)) = 10 - x months. Right.\n\nBut the total profit is 375,000, and C gets 150,000. So, C's share is 150,000, which is (150,000 / 375,000) = 0.4, which is 40% of the total profit. So the ratio of C's contribution to the total contributions should be 40%.\n\nSo, the profit is divided based on the ratio of their individual (capital \u00d7 time). So the total ratio is A:B:C's (capital \u00d7 time).\n\nLet me compute each:\n\nA's: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000\nB's: 60,000 * (10) = 600,000\nC's: 120,000 * (10 - x) = 120,000*(10 -x )\n\nSo the total contribution is 480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(10 -x) = 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000 x = 2,280,000 - 120,000 x.\n\nWait, that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should express the ratios.\n\nThe ratio of their shares is A:B:C = (40000\u00d712) : (60000\u00d710) : (120000\u00d7(10 -x)).\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n40000 *12 = 480,000\n60000 *10 = 600,000\n120000*(10 -x) = 1,200,000 - 120,000 x\n\nSo the ratio is 480,000 : 600,000 : (1,200,000 - 120,000 x).\n\nWe can divide each term by 60,000 to simplify:\n\n480,000 /60,000 = 8\n600,000 /60,000 =10\n(1,200,000 - 120,000 x)/60,000 = 20 - 2x.\n\nSo the ratio is 8 : 10 : (20 - 2x).\n\nNow, the total parts = 8 +10 + (20 -2x) = 38 -2x.\n\nBut wait, the profit is divided in the ratio of their contributions. So C's share is (20 -2x) parts out of (38 - 2x) parts.\n\nWe know that C's share is 150,000, and total profit is 375,000. So 150,000 / 375,000 = 1/2.5 = 0.4. So 40% of the profit goes to C.\n\nSo, (20 - 2x)/(38 - 2x) = 0.4.\n\nLet me write that equation:\n\n(20 - 2x) / (38 - 2x) = 0.4\n\nMultiply both sides by (38 -2x):\n\n20 - 2x = 0.4*(38 -2x)\n\nLet me compute the right side:\n\n0.4 * 38 = 15.2\n0.4 * (-2x) = -0.8x\n\nSo:\n\n20 - 2x = 15.2 - 0.8x\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n20 -2x -15.2 +0.8x =0\n(20 -15.2) + (-2x +0.8x) =0\n4.8 - 1.2x =0\n\nSo,\n\n4.8 = 1.2x\nx = 4.8 / 1.2\nx =4\n\nSo x is 4 months.\n\nWait, x is the time after B joined that C joined. So C joined 4 months after B.\n\nBut let me double-check the calculations.\n\nSo in the ratio, (20-2x)/(38-2x) = 0.4.\n\nPlugging x=4:\n\n(20-8)/(38-8) =12/30= 0.4. Correct.\n\nSo yes, x is 4.\n\nSo the correct answer is option B)4 months.\n",

Given that C receives 40% of the profit (\\(150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4\\)), we set up the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{20 - 2x}{38 - 2x} = 0.4\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Solve for \\(x\\)\nMultiply both sides by \\((38 - 2x)\\):\n\\[\n20 - 2x = 0.4 \\times (38 - 2x)\n\\]\nSimplify the right side:\n\\[\n20 - 2x = 15.2 - 0.8x\n\\]\nRearrange terms:\n\\[\n20 - 15.2 = 2x - 0.8x\n\\]\n\\[\n4.8 = 1.2x\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4.8}{1.2} = 4\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Interpret the result\n\\(x = 4\\) means C joined the business 4 months after B joined.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**Answer: B**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this business problem. Hmm, so A starts a business with Rs.40,000. Then after 2 months, B joins with Rs.60,000. Then C joins some time after that with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000. We need to find out how many months after B joined did C join. The options are A to E.\n\nWait, I remember that in partnership problems, the profit is divided based on the capital multiplied by the time each partner was involved. So, the idea is to calculate each person's share as (capital \u00d7 time) and then find the ratio.\n\nLet me structure the timeline. The total period is 12 months.\n\nA started first. So A's investment was for 12 months. Then B joined after 2 months, so B's investment was for 10 months. C joined some time after B, and we don't know when exactly. Let's denote the number of months after B joined as 'x'. So C joined after 2 + x months. Wait, no. Wait, let me think again. The total time C was in is (12 - (2 + x)) months? No, wait. Because the business runs for a year. So if A started at month 0, B joined at month 2. C joined at month 2 + x, where x is the number of months after B joined. Then, the time C was in the business would be 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months. Wait, no, wait. Because if C joined after x months from when B joined, then C's time is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months. Because from month 2 to month (2+x), that's x months, but from then till end of the year is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to represent each person's time in the business:\n\n- A's time: 12 months.\n- B's time: 12 - 2 = 10 months.\n- C's time: let's say C joined after 'y' months from the start. So C's time is 12 - y months.\n\nBut wait, B joined after 2 months, so C joined after B. So y must be greater than 2. So C's time is (12 - y) months.\n\nBut the question is, how many months after B joined did C join? So the time between when B joined (at 2 months) and C joined (at y months) is (y - 2) months. So the variable we need is (y - 2), which is the number of months after B that C joined.\n\nSo let's denote:\n\n- A's capital: 40,000 for 12 months.\n- B's capital: 60,000 for (12 - 2) = 10 months.\n- C's capital: 120,000 for (12 - y) months.\n\nWait, but since C joined after B, y must be greater than 2. So, C's time is (12 - y) months. So, the profit ratio would be based on the product of capital and time.\n\nThe total profit is 375,000. C's share is 150,000. So the ratio of C's share to total is 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4. So C's share is 40% of the profit.\n\nBut wait, that's not the way to look at it. The profit is divided in the ratio of their individual contributions. So the total contribution is (A's share + B's share + C's share) = total ratio.\n\nLet me compute each person's contribution:\n\nA's contribution: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000.\nB's contribution: 60,000 * (12 - 2) = 60,000 * 10 = 600,000.\nC's contribution: 120,000 * (12 - y) = 120,000 * (12 - y).\n\nWait, but I need to find when C joined, which is y months from the start, so (12 - y) is his time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the time each partner was involved. Let's denote:\n\n- A: 12 months\n- B: 10 months (since he joined after 2 months)\n- C: let's say C joined after (2 + x) months from start, so his time is (12 - (2 + x)) = 10 - x months.\n\nSo, C joined x months after B. So x is the number we're trying to find.\n\nSo, A's contribution: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000\nB's contribution: 60,000 * (12 - 2) = 60,000 * 10 = 600,000\nC's contribution: 120,000 * (10 - x) \n\nWait, no, because C's time is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x. Because if C joined x months after B (who joined at 2 months), then the time C is in is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x.\n\nBut wait, x is the months after B joined. So yes, C's time is (12 - (2 + x)) = 10 - x.\n\nSo the profit ratio is A : B : C = 40,000*12 : 60,000*10 : 120,000*(10 - x).\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nA: 40,000 *12 = 480,000\nB: 60,000 *10 = 600,000\nC: 120,000*(10 - x) = 1,200,000 - 120,000 x\n\nBut the total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000.\n\nWait, no. The profit is divided based on their ratios. So the total ratio is (480,000 + 600,000 + (1,200,000 - 120,000 x)) = 480,000 + 600,000 is 1,080,000, plus 1,200,000 gives 2,280,000 minus 120,000 x.\n\nWait, but the total profit is 375,000. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the ratio of their contributions.\n\nEach partner's share is proportional to their contribution (capital \u00d7 time). So the ratio of their shares is A : B : C = 480,000 : 600,000 : (1,200,000 - 120,000 x).\n\nWe can simplify this ratio by dividing each term by 10,000 to make it easier: 48 : 60 : (120 - 12x).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps factor out 12 from each term.\n\nWait, 480,000 is 40,000 * 12, 600,000 is 60,000 *10, 1,200,000 is 120,000 * 10, etc.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to find the total profit ratio and find C's share based on that.\n\nWait, the profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000.\n\nSo, the ratio of C's share to the total is 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4. So 40% of the profit goes to C.\n\nWhich means that C's contribution is 40% of the total contributions.\n\nWait, but the contributions are (A's + B's + C's) = 480,000 + 600,000 + (1,200,000 - 120,000 x) = 480k + 600k = 1,080k + 1,200k = 2,280k - 120k x.\n\nWait, but that's the total contribution. So C's contribution is (1,200,000 - 120,000 x).\n\nAnd according to the ratio, C's share is 40% of total profit, which is 0.4 * 375,000 = 150,000, which matches the given data.\n\nBut perhaps another approach: since the profit is divided according to the ratio of their contributions, the share each person gets is (their contribution) / (total contribution) * total profit.\n\nSo, C's share is (C's contribution) / (A + B + C) ) * 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nSo, (120,000*(10 - x)) / (480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(10 - x)) ) * 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nSimplify this equation.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n(120000*(10 - x)) / (480000 + 600000 + 120000*(10 - x)) ) = 150000 / 375000.\n\n150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4.\n\nSo,\n\n120000*(10 - x) / (1080000 + 120000*(10 -x )) = 0.4.\n\nLet me compute the denominator:\n\n1080000 + 120000*(10 - x) = 1080000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000 x = 2,280,000 - 120,000 x.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n120000*(10 - x) = 0.4 * (2,280,000 - 120,000 x).\n\nLet me compute the right side:\n\n0.4 * 2,280,000 = 912,000.\n\n0.4 * (-120,000 x) = -48,000 x.\n\nSo the right side is 912,000 - 48,000 x.\n\nLeft side: 1,200,000 - 120,000 x.\n\nSo:\n\n1,200,000 - 120,000 x = 912,000 -48,000 x.\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side.\n\n1,200,000 - 912,000 = 120,000 x -48,000 x.\n\n288,000 = 72,000 x.\n\nSo x = 288,000 / 72,000 = 4.\n\nWait, x is 4 months. So, C joined 4 months after B.\n\nBut wait, the question is, how many months after B joined did C join? So the answer is 4 months, which is option B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes the time calculations can be tricky.\n\nSo if B joined at month 2, and C joined 4 months after B, that's at month 6. So C's time in the business would be 12 -6 =6 months.\n\nWait, but let me recalculate the contributions:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000.\n\nB: 60,000 * 10 = 600,000.\n\nC: 120,000 * 6 = 720,000.\n\nTotal contribution: 480k +600k = 1,080k +720k= 1,800,000.\n\nWait, but wait, 480k+600k=1,080k. 1,080k +720k= 1,800k.\n\nSo the total is 1,800,000.\n\nC's share: (720,000 / 1,800,000) *375,000 = (0.4) *375,000 = 150,000. Which matches the given data. So yes, x=4 is correct.\n\nSo the answer is 4 months, which is option B.\n",

So C's contribution is (1,200,000 - 120,000 x).\n\nAnd according to the ratio, C's share is 40% of total profit, which is 0.4 * 375,000 = 150,000, which matches the given data.\n\nBut perhaps another approach: since the profit is divided according to the ratio of their contributions, the share each person gets is (their contribution) / (total contribution) * total profit.\n\nSo, C's share is (C's contribution) / (A + B + C) ) * 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nSo, (120,000*(10 - x)) / (480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(10 - x)) ) * 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nSimplify this equation.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n(120000*(10 - x)) / (480000 + 600000 + 120000*(10 - x)) ) = 150000 / 375000.\n\n150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4.\n\nSo,\n\n120000*(10 - x) / (1080000 + 120000*(10 -x )) = 0.4.\n\nLet me compute the denominator:\n\n1080000 + 120000*(10 - x) = 1080000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000 x = 2,280,000 - 120,000 x.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n120000*(10 - x) = 0.4 * (2,280,000 - 120,000 x).\n\nLet me compute the right side:\n\n0.4 * 2,280,000 = 912,000.\n\n0.4 * (-120,000 x) = -48,000 x.\n\nSo the right side is 912,000 - 48,000 x.\n\nLeft side: 1,200,000 - 120,000 x.\n\nSo:\n\n1,200,000 - 120,000 x = 912,000 -48,000 x.\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side.\n\n1,200,000 - 912,000 = 120,000 x -48,000 x.\n\n288,000 = 72,000 x.\n\nSo x = 288,000 / 72,000 = 4.\n\nWait, x is 4 months. So, C joined 4 months after B.\n\nBut wait, the question is, how many months after B joined did C join? So the answer is 4 months, which is option B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes the time calculations can be tricky.\n\nSo if B joined at month 2, and C joined 4 months after B, that's at month 6. So C's time in the business would be 12 -6 =6 months.\n\nWait, but let me recalculate the contributions:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000.\n\nB: 60,000 * 10 = 600,000.\n\nC: 120,000 * 6 = 720,000.\n\nTotal contribution: 480k +600k = 1,080k +720k= 1,800,000.\n\nWait, but wait, 480k+600k=1,080k. 1,080k +720k= 1,800k.\n\nSo the total is 1,800,000.\n\nC's share: (720,000 / 1,800,000) *375,000 = (0.4) *375,000 = 150,000. Which matches the given data. So yes, x=4 is correct.\n\nSo the answer is 4 months, which is option B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we calculate the profit share based on the capital invested and the time each partner was involved in the business. The profit is distributed in the ratio of their contributions, which is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Contribution} = \\text{Capital} \\times \\text{Time}\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Define the timeline and contributions\n- **A** starts the business with Rs. 40,000 and remains for the entire year, so:\n  \\[\n  \\text{A's contribution} = 40,000 \\times 12 = 480,000\n  \\]\n- **B** joins after 2 months with Rs. 60,000 and remains for \\(12 - 2 = 10\\) months, so:\n  \\[\n  \\text{B's contribution} = 60,000 \\times 10 = 600,000\n  \\]\n- **C** joins after \\(2 + x\\) months (where \\(x\\) is the number of months after B joined) and remains for \\(12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x\\) months. Thus:\n  \\[\n  \\text{C's contribution} = 120,000 \\times (10 - x)\n  \\]\n\n### Step 2: Total profit and C's share\nThe total profit is Rs. 375,000, and C's share is Rs. 150,000. The ratio of C's share to the total profit is:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{C's share}}{\\text{Total profit}} = \\frac{150,000}{375,000} = 0.4\n\\]\nThis means C's contribution is 40% of the total contributions.\n\n### Step 3: Set up the equation for total contributions\nThe total contributions are:\n\\[\n\\text{Total contributions} = 480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000 \\times (10 - x)\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\\[\n\\text{Total contributions} = 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000x = 2,280,000 - 120,000x\n\\]\n\nC's contribution is:\n\\[\n\\text{C's contribution} = 120,000 \\times (10 - x)\n\\]\n\nAccording to the ratio:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{C's contribution}}{\\text{Total contributions}} = 0.4\n\\]\nSubstitute the expressions:\n\\[\n\\frac{120,000 \\times (10 - x)}{2,280,000 - 120,000x} = 0.4\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Solve for \\(x\\)\nMultiply through by the denominator:\n\\[\n120,000 \\times (10 - x) = 0.4 \\times (2,280,000 - 120,000x)\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\\[\n1,200,000 - 120,000x = 912,000 - 48,000x\n\\]\nRearrange terms:\n\\[\n1,200,000 - 912,000 = 120,000x - 48,000x\n\\]\n\\[\n288,000 = 72,000x\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{288,000}{72,000} = 4\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Interpret the result\n\\(x = 4\\) means C joined **4 months after B**.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this business partnership problem. Let me read it again and think step by step.\n\nSo, A starts a business with Rs.40,000. After 2 months, B joins with Rs.60,000. Then, C joins them after some more time with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000. I need to find out how many months after B joined did C join.\n\nHmm, I remember that in partnership problems, the profit is divided based on the capital multiplied by the time each partner has been involved. So each partner's share depends on their investment and the duration they were in the business.\n\nLet me break down the timeline. The business runs for a year, which is 12 months.\n\nA started first with Rs.40,000. B joined after 2 months, so B's investment is 12 - 2 = 10 months? Wait, no. Wait, the total time the business runs is 12 months. So A was there for the entire 12 months. B joined after 2 months, so B's time is 12 - 2 = 10 months. But wait, wait, no. Let me think again. If A started at month 0, then after 2 months (at month 2), B joins. So from month 2 to month 12 is 10 months for B. So B's duration is 10 months.\n\nC joined after some more time. Let me denote the time between B joining and C joining as x months. So C joined at month 2 + x. Then, how long was C in the business? From month (2+x) to month 12, which is 12 - (2+x) = 10 - x months. So C's duration is (10 - x) months.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The question says C joined after some more time after B joined. So B was already in the business for some time before C came in. So the time C was in the business is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 -x months, as I thought.\n\nNow, the profit is divided in the ratio of their capital multiplied by the time. So the ratio would be:\n\nA : B : C = (40,000 * 12) : (60,000 * 10) : (120,000 * (10 -x))\n\nLet me compute each part.\n\nA's investment-time: 40,000 *12 = 480,000\nB's: 60,000 *10 = 600,000\nC's: 120,000 * (10 -x) = 120,000*(10-x) \n\nWait, but wait, the total profit is 375,000 and C gets 150,000. So C's share is 150,000. Let me find the ratio of their profits.\n\nTotal profit is 375,000. So C's share is 150,000. So the ratio of C's share to the total is 150,000 / 375,000 = 1/2.5, or 0.4.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to compute the ratio of each person's share to the total.\n\nAlternatively, since the profit is divided in the ratio of their individual (capital * time), the sum of all parts is the total profit.\n\nWait, no, that's not exactly right. The ratio of their shares is equal to the ratio of their (capital * time). So the sum of the ratios is equal to the total profit.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the ratio of their investments over time. Let me compute each person's share as a fraction of the total.\n\nSo, the total \"capital-time\" is:\n\nA: 40,000 *12 = 480,000\nB:60,000 *10=600,000\nC:120,000*(10 -x)=1,200,000*(10-x) (Wait, no. Wait, 120,000 multiplied by (10 -x). So 120,000*(10-x) = 1,200,000*(10-x)/10? No, wait, 120,000 is 1.2 *10^5. Hmm, perhaps I should compute numerically.\n\nWait, A's is 40,000 *12 = 480,000.\n\nB's is 60,000 *10 = 600,000.\n\nC's is 120,000 * (10 -x) = 1,200,000*(10 -x)/10? No, wait, 120,000 is 120,000. So 120,000*(10 -x) = 1,200,000*(10-x) /10? Hmm, perhaps I should think of it as 120,000*(10 -x) = 120,000*(10 -x) = 120,000* (10 -x) = let's just compute it as 120,000*(10-x) = 1,200,000 - 120,000x.\n\nWait, but maybe I can express each person's share in terms of their (capital * time). The total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. So the ratio of C's share to the total is 150,000 /375,000 = 0.4. So C's (capital * time) divided by the sum of all (capital * time) equals 0.4.\n\nWait, let me denote:\n\nTotal = A + B + C = 480,000 + 600,000 + [120,000*(10 -x)].\n\nSo, 480,000 + 600,000 = 1,080,000.\n\nSo total is 1,080,000 + 120,000*(10 -x) = 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000x = 2,280,000 - 120,000x.\n\nWait, no, wait: 120,000*(10 -x) is 1,200,000 - 120,000x.\n\nSo total is 480,000 + 600,000 + 1,200,000 -120,000x.\n\n480k +600k is 1,080,000. Plus 1,200,000 is 2,280,000. So total is 2,280,000 -120,000x.\n\nC's share is 120,000*(10 -x) = 1,200,000 -120,000x.\n\nSo the fraction of the total that C gets is (1,200,000 -120,000x) / (2,280,000 -120,000x) ) = 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4.\n\nSo,\n\n(1,200,000 -120,000x) / (2,280,000 -120,000x) ) = 0.4\n\nLet me write this equation:\n\n(1,200,000 -120,000x) = 0.4 * (2,280,000 -120,000x)\n\nLet me compute the right side:\n\n0.4 * 2,280,000 = 912,000\n\n0.4 * (-120,000x) = -48,000x\n\nSo right side is 912,000 -48,000x.\n\nLeft side is 1,200,000 -120,000x.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n1,200,000 -120,000x = 912,000 -48,000x\n\nLet me bring all terms to left side:\n\n1,200,000 -912,000 -120,000x +48,000x = 0\n\n288,000 -72,000x = 0\n\nSo 288,000 =72,000x\n\nDivide both sides by 72,000:\n\nx = 288,000 /72,000 = 4.\n\nSo x is 4 months. Wait, but what does x represent? x is the number of months after B joined that C joined. So x=4 months. So C joined 4 months after B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations to avoid mistakes.\n\nLet me recompute:\n\nEquation after substitution:\n\n1,200,000 -120,000x = 0.4*(2,280,000 -120,000x )\n\nCompute RHS:\n\n0.4 * 2,280,000 = 912,000\n\n0.4 * (-120,000x) = -48,000x\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n1,200,000 -120,000x = 912,000 -48,000x\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n1,200,000 -912,000 = 120,000x -48,000x\n\n288,000 =72,000x \u2192 x=4.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo x is 4 months. So C joined 4 months after B.\n\nWait, the question asks how many months after B joined did C join? So the answer is 4 months, which is option B.\n",

Hmm, perhaps I should think of it as 120,000*(10 -x) = 120,000*(10 -x) = 120,000* (10 -x) = let's just compute it as 120,000*(10-x) = 1,200,000 - 120,000x.\n\nWait, but maybe I can express each person's share in terms of their (capital * time). The total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. So the ratio of C's share to the total is 150,000 /375,000 = 0.4. So C's (capital * time) divided by the sum of all (capital * time) equals 0.4.\n\nWait, let me denote:\n\nTotal = A + B + C = 480,000 + 600,000 + [120,000*(10 -x)].\n\nSo, 480,000 + 600,000 = 1,080,000.\n\nSo total is 1,080,000 + 120,000*(10 -x) = 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000x = 2,280,000 - 120,000x.\n\nWait, no, wait: 120,000*(10 -x) is 1,200,000 - 120,000x.\n\nSo total is 480,000 + 600,000 + 1,200,000 -120,000x.\n\n480k +600k is 1,080,000. Plus 1,200,000 is 2,280,000. So total is 2,280,000 -120,000x.\n\nC's share is 120,000*(10 -x) = 1,200,000 -120,000x.\n\nSo the fraction of the total that C gets is (1,200,000 -120,000x) / (2,280,000 -120,000x) ) = 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4.\n\nSo,\n\n(1,200,000 -120,000x) / (2,280,000 -120,000x) ) = 0.4\n\nLet me write this equation:\n\n(1,200,000 -120,000x) = 0.4 * (2,280,000 -120,000x)\n\nLet me compute the right side:\n\n0.4 * 2,280,000 = 912,000\n\n0.4 * (-120,000x) = -48,000x\n\nSo right side is 912,000 -48,000x.\n\nLeft side is 1,200,000 -120,000x.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n1,200,000 -120,000x = 912,000 -48,000x\n\nLet me bring all terms to left side:\n\n1,200,000 -912,000 -120,000x +48,000x = 0\n\n288,000 -72,000x = 0\n\nSo 288,000 =72,000x\n\nDivide both sides by 72,000:\n\nx = 288,000 /72,000 = 4.\n\nSo x is 4 months. Wait, but what does x represent? x is the number of months after B joined that C joined. So x=4 months. So C joined 4 months after B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations to avoid mistakes.\n\nLet me recompute:\n\nEquation after substitution:\n\n1,200,000 -120,000x = 0.4*(2,280,000 -120,000x )\n\nCompute RHS:\n\n0.4 * 2,280,000 = 912,000\n\n0.4 * (-120,000x) = -48,000x\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n1,200,000 -120,000x = 912,000 -48,000x\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n1,200,000 -912,000 = 120,000x -48,000x\n\n288,000 =72,000x \u2192 x=4.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo x is 4 months. So C joined 4 months after B.\n\nWait, the question asks how many months after B joined did C join? So the answer is 4 months, which is option B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the profit-sharing ratio based on the capital and time each partner invested in the business.\n\n### Key Details:\n1. **A's Investment**: A starts with Rs. 40,000 and remains in the business for the entire 12 months.\n   - A's contribution: \\( 40,000 \\times 12 = 480,000 \\).\n\n2. **B's Investment**: B joins after 2 months with Rs. 60,000 and remains in the business for \\( 12 - 2 = 10 \\) months.\n   - B's contribution: \\( 60,000 \\times 10 = 600,000 \\).\n\n3. **C's Investment**: C joins after \\( x \\) months from B's joining (i.e., at month \\( 2 + x \\)) with Rs. 120,000 and remains in the business for \\( 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x \\) months.\n   - C's contribution: \\( 120,000 \\times (10 - x) \\).\n\n4. **Total Profit**: The total profit is Rs. 375,000, and C's share is Rs. 150,000. The profit is distributed in the ratio of their contributions.\n\n### Profit-Sharing Ratio:\nThe total contribution is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Contribution} = 480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000 \\times (10 - x) = 2,280,000 - 120,000x.\n\\]\n\nC's share of the profit is given as Rs. 150,000, which corresponds to the fraction:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{C's Contribution}}{\\text{Total Contribution}} = \\frac{120,000 \\times (10 - x)}{2,280,000 - 120,000x}.\n\\]\n\nSince C's share of the profit is \\( \\frac{150,000}{375,000} = 0.4 \\), we set up the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{120,000 \\times (10 - x)}{2,280,000 - 120,000x} = 0.4.\n\\]\n\n### Solving for \\( x \\):\n1. Multiply both sides by \\( 2,280,000 - 120,000x \\):\n\\[\n120,000 \\times (10 - x) = 0.4 \\times (2,280,000 - 120,000x).\n\\]\n\n2. Expand the right-hand side:\n\\[\n120,000 \\times (10 - x) = 912,000 - 48,000x.\n\\]\n\n3. Expand the left-hand side:\n\\[\n1,200,000 - 120,000x = 912,000 - 48,000x.\n\\]\n\n4. Rearrange terms:\n\\[\n1,200,000 - 912,000 = 120,000x - 48,000x.\n\\]\n\n5. Simplify:\n\\[\n288,000 = 72,000x.\n\\]\n\n6. Solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{288,000}{72,000} = 4.\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nC joined the business 4 months after B joined. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: B**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about partners in a business and their profit shares. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.\n\nAlright, the problem says that A starts a business with Rs.40,000. Then after 2 months, B joins with Rs.60,000. Then C joins after some more time with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000. The question is how many months after B joined did C join?\n\nWait, wait. So the time each person's investment is in the business matters because their profit share depends on both the capital and the time. It's like, the longer you invest, the more share you get, right?\n\nSo the formula for profit sharing in such cases is based on the product of the capital and the time each person has invested. So each partner's share is proportional to (capital \u00d7 time). \n\nLet me jot down the details:\n\n- A invested Rs.40,000 for the entire year. But wait, the entire year is 12 months. So A's time is 12 months.\n- B joined after 2 months, so B's investment period is 12 minus 2, which is 10 months. So B invested Rs.60,000 for 10 months.\n- C joined after some time, let's say after 'x' months from when B joined. Or wait, no. Let me clarify: B joined after 2 months from the start. Then C joined after 'y' months after B joined. So the total time from when the business started until C joined is 2 + y months. Therefore, C's investment period is 12 - (2 + y) months.\n\nWait, no. Let me get this straight. The business starts when A starts. A is there from month 0 to 12. B joins after 2 months, so B is there from month 2 to 12, which is 10 months. C joins after some more time after B, so C's time is from (2 + y) to 12, where y is the number of months after B joined that C joined. So C's investment time is 12 - (2 + y) = 10 - y months.\n\nWait, but the options are in the range of 2 to 84 months. Hmm, but if C joined after B, and the maximum time possible is when C joined right before the end, so y can't be more than 10, because C can't invest for a negative time.\n\nWait, but the problem says C joined after some more time after B. So the time C is in the business is 12 - (2 + y) = 10 - y months. But y must be positive, so 10 - y would be less than 10.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me rephrase: the total time each person's money was in the business is:\n\n- A: 12 months\n- B: 10 months (since he joined after 2 months)\n- C: (12 - t) months, where t is the month when C joined. But t is 2 + y, where y is the months after B joined. So t = 2 + y. So C's time is 12 - (2 + y) = 10 - y.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because if y is the time after B joined, then when y is 0, C joins right when B does, and when y is 10, C joins at the end of the 12th month, so C's time would be zero. So that makes sense.\n\nSo, the profit is divided in the ratio of their investments multiplied by their time.\n\nSo, the profit share ratio is (A's capital * A's time) : (B's capital * B's time) : (C's capital * C's time).\n\nWhich is (40000 *12) : (60000 *10) : (120000*(10 - y)).\n\nLet me compute these:\n\nA's part: 40000 *12 = 480,000\nB's part: 60,000 *10 = 600,000\nC's part: 120,000*(10 - y) = 12,000,000 - 1,200,000 y.\n\nThe total profit is 375,000. So the sum of all parts would be 375,000.\n\nWait, but actually, the profit is divided in the ratio of their contributions. So the total ratio is A + B + C = 480,000 + 600,000 + (12,000,000 - 1,200,000 y) = 13,080,000 - 1,200,000 y.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because the total profit is 375,000, which is much smaller than the sum of their contributions. Wait, no. Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused here. The profit is divided according to the ratio of their investments. So each person's share is (their investment * time) / total investments (sum of all A, B, C) multiplied by the total profit.\n\nSo, C's share is (120000*(10 - y)) / (40000*12 + 60000*10 + 120000*(10 - y)) ) * 375000.\n\nAnd according to the problem, C's share is 150,000. So:\n\n150000 = [120000*(10 - y) / (480000 + 600000 + 120000*(10 - y)) ] * 375000.\n\nLet me simplify this equation.\n\nFirst, let me compute the denominator:\n\n480,000 + 600,000 = 1,080,000.\n\nDenominator = 1,080,000 + 120,000*(10 - y) = 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000 y = 2,280,000 - 120,000 y.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n150,000 = [120,000*(10 - y) / (2,280,000 - 120,000 y) ) ] * 375,000.\n\nDivide both sides by 375,000:\n\n150,000 / 375,000 = [120,000*(10 - y) ] / (2,280,000 - 120,000 y).\n\nSimplify 150k / 375k = 1/2.5 = 0.4. Or 2/5.\n\nSo:\n\n(120,000*(10 - y)) / (2,280,000 - 120,000 y) = 0.4.\n\nWait, 0.4 is 2/5. So,\n\n(120,000*(10 - y)) / (2,280,000 - 120,000 y) = 2/5.\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n5 * 120,000 (10 - y) = 2 * (2,280,000 - 120,000 y).\n\nCompute left side: 600,000 (10 - y) = 6,000,000 - 600,000 y.\n\nRight side: 2 * 2,280,000 = 4,560,000, and 2*(-120,000 y) = -240,000 y. So right side is 4,560,000 - 240,000 y.\n\nNow equation:\n\n6,000,000 - 600,000 y = 4,560,000 - 240,000 y.\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n6,000,000 - 4,560,000 -600,000 y + 240,000 y =0.\n\n1,440,000 - 360,000 y =0.\n\nSo, 1,440,000 = 360,000 y.\n\nDivide both sides by 360,000: y = 1,440,000 / 360,000 = 4.\n\nWait, y is 4? So y is 4 months. So C joined 4 months after B. So after B joined (after 2 months), C joined after another 4 months. So total time from A's start is 2 +4=6 months, and C's investment time is 12-6=6 months.\n\nWait, but let me check: So C's time is 6 months. So let's compute the ratios.\n\nA's contribution: 40000 *12 = 480,000.\nB's: 60000 *10=600,000.\nC's: 120000 *6=720,000.\n\nTotal ratio: 480k + 600k +720k = 1,800,000.\n\nC's share is 720,000 / 1,800,000 * 375,000 = (0.4) *375,000= 150,000. Which matches the problem statement. So yes, y=4.\n\nSo the correct answer is 4 months. Looking at the options, option B is 4 months. So the answer should be B.\n",

So:\n\n150000 = [120000*(10 - y) / (480000 + 600000 + 120000*(10 - y)) ] * 375000.\n\nLet me simplify this equation.\n\nFirst, let me compute the denominator:\n\n480,000 + 600,000 = 1,080,000.\n\nDenominator = 1,080,000 + 120,000*(10 - y) = 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000 y = 2,280,000 - 120,000 y.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n150,000 = [120,000*(10 - y) / (2,280,000 - 120,000 y) ) ] * 375,000.\n\nDivide both sides by 375,000:\n\n150,000 / 375,000 = [120,000*(10 - y) ] / (2,280,000 - 120,000 y).\n\nSimplify 150k / 375k = 1/2.5 = 0.4. Or 2/5.\n\nSo:\n\n(120,000*(10 - y)) / (2,280,000 - 120,000 y) = 0.4.\n\nWait, 0.4 is 2/5. So,\n\n(120,000*(10 - y)) / (2,280,000 - 120,000 y) = 2/5.\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n5 * 120,000 (10 - y) = 2 * (2,280,000 - 120,000 y).\n\nCompute left side: 600,000 (10 - y) = 6,000,000 - 600,000 y.\n\nRight side: 2 * 2,280,000 = 4,560,000, and 2*(-120,000 y) = -240,000 y. So right side is 4,560,000 - 240,000 y.\n\nNow equation:\n\n6,000,000 - 600,000 y = 4,560,000 - 240,000 y.\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n6,000,000 - 4,560,000 -600,000 y + 240,000 y =0.\n\n1,440,000 - 360,000 y =0.\n\nSo, 1,440,000 = 360,000 y.\n\nDivide both sides by 360,000: y = 1,440,000 / 360,000 = 4.\n\nWait, y is 4? So y is 4 months. So C joined 4 months after B. So after B joined (after 2 months), C joined after another 4 months. So total time from A's start is 2 +4=6 months, and C's investment time is 12-6=6 months.\n\nWait, but let me check: So C's time is 6 months. So let's compute the ratios.\n\nA's contribution: 40000 *12 = 480,000.\nB's: 60000 *10=600,000.\nC's: 120000 *6=720,000.\n\nTotal ratio: 480k + 600k +720k = 1,800,000.\n\nC's share is 720,000 / 1,800,000 * 375,000 = (0.4) *375,000= 150,000. Which matches the problem statement. So yes, y=4.\n\nSo the correct answer is 4 months. Looking at the options, option B is 4 months. So the answer should be B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we calculate the profit-sharing ratio based on the capital and time each partner invested. The profit is distributed proportionally to the product of capital and time.\n\n### Details:\n- **A's investment**: Rs. 40,000 for 12 months.\n- **B's investment**: Rs. 60,000 for 10 months (since B joined after 2 months).\n- **C's investment**: Rs. 120,000 for \\(10 - y\\) months, where \\(y\\) is the number of months after B joined that C joined.\n\nThe profit-sharing ratio is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = (A's \\, capital \\times A's \\, time) : (B's \\, capital \\times B's \\, time) : (C's \\, capital \\times C's \\, time)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = (40,000 \\times 12) : (60,000 \\times 10) : (120,000 \\times (10 - y))\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = 480,000 : 600,000 : (1,200,000 - 120,000y)\n\\]\n\nThe total profit is Rs. 375,000, and C's share is Rs. 150,000. Using the ratio, we calculate \\(y\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{C's share} = \\frac{\\text{C's investment}}{\\text{Total investment}} \\times \\text{Total profit}\n\\]\n\\[\n150,000 = \\frac{120,000 \\times (10 - y)}{480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000 \\times (10 - y)} \\times 375,000\n\\]\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n\\[\n480,000 + 600,000 = 1,080,000\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Denominator} = 1,080,000 + 120,000 \\times (10 - y) = 2,280,000 - 120,000y\n\\]\n\nSubstitute into the equation:\n\\[\n150,000 = \\frac{120,000 \\times (10 - y)}{2,280,000 - 120,000y} \\times 375,000\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 375,000:\n\\[\n\\frac{150,000}{375,000} = \\frac{120,000 \\times (10 - y)}{2,280,000 - 120,000y}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{120,000 \\times (10 - y)}{2,280,000 - 120,000y}\n\\]\n\nCross-multiply:\n\\[\n5 \\times 120,000 \\times (10 - y) = 2 \\times (2,280,000 - 120,000y)\n\\]\n\\[\n6,000,000 - 600,000y = 4,560,000 - 240,000y\n\\]\n\nRearrange terms:\n\\[\n6,000,000 - 4,560,000 = 600,000y - 240,000y\n\\]\n\\[\n1,440,000 = 360,000y\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\(y\\):\n\\[\ny = \\frac{1,440,000}{360,000} = 4\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(y = 4\\).
