      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says that a coin diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin she brings up from the bottom of a river, and 25 cents for each brass coin. After one dive, she earned $3.40. The question is asking for the minimum number of copper coins she could have brought. The options are A)4, B)3, C)2, D)1, E)0.\n\nHmm, so I think this is a system of equations problem. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I'll define variables for the number of copper and brass coins. Let's say c is the number of copper coins and b is the number of brass coins. \n\nEach copper coin gives her 20 cents, so the total from copper is 20c cents. Each brass is 25 cents, so that's 25b cents. The total she earned is $3.40, which is 340 cents. So the equation is 20c + 25b = 340.\n\nWe need to find the minimum number of copper coins (c) possible. So I need to find all possible integer solutions (c and b must be non-negative integers) and pick the one with the smallest c.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation to express b in terms of c. So, 25b = 340 -20c. Dividing both sides by 5, that's 5b = 68 -4c. So 5b = 68 -4c. Then, b = (68 -4c)/5.\n\nSince b has to be an integer, (68 -4c) must be divisible by 5. So 68 -4c \u2261 0 mod 5. Let me think about what that implies.\n\n68 mod 5 is 3 because 5*13=65, 68-65=3. So 3 -4c mod 5 should be 0. So 4c mod5 should be 3.\n\nWait, 4c \u22613 mod5. Hmm, what value of c satisfies this? Let me think of c as varying and see which makes 4c mod5 equal 3.\n\nLet me try c=0: 4*0=0 mod5 \u21920. Not 3.\nc=1:4 \u21924 mod5=4. Not 3.\nc=2:8 \u21928 mod5=3. Oh, yes, that works.\nSo when c=2, 4c=8, 8 mod5 is 3. So 68-8=60, which is divisible by 5. So b=60/5=12.\n\nWait, so c=2 and b=12 is a solution. That gives 20*2 +25*12=40 +300=340. Yes, that adds up.\n\nBut wait, the question is the minimum number of copper coins. So is there a smaller c than 2 that works?\n\nLet me check c=1. Let's see if 4c=4. 4 mod5 is 4, which isn't 3. So 68-4=64. 64 divided by 5 is 12.8, which is not an integer. So b would be 12.8, which is impossible because you can't have a fraction of a coin.\n\nWhat about c=3? 4*3=12. 12 mod5 is 2. 68-12=56. 56/5=11.2. Not integer. So no solution here.\n\nc=4: 4*4=16. 16 mod5 is 1. 68-16=52. 52/5=10.4. Not integer.\n\nc=5:4*5=20. 20 mod5 is 0. 68-20=48. 48/5=9.6. No.\n\nc=6:4*6=24 mod5 is 4 (24/5 is 4*5=20, 24-20=4). So 68-24=44. 44/5=8.8. Not integer.\n\nc=7:4*7=28 mod5 is 3 (28-25=3). So 68-28=40. 40/5=8. So b=8. So c=7 and b=8 is another solution.\n\nWait, so c=7 is another possible number. But the question is the minimum c. So between c=2 and c=7, the minimum is 2.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check if there are any c less than 2 that might work. Like c=0.\n\nc=0: 4*0=0. 68-0=68. 68/5=13.6. Not integer. So no.\n\nSo the next possible c is 2, then 7, then 12, etc., adding 5 each time because the modulus is 5. Because 4c \u22613 mod5. The solutions for c are numbers that when multiplied by 4 give 3 mod5.\n\nWait, 4c \u22613 mod5. Let me solve for c. Multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 4 mod5. The inverse of 4 mod5 is 4, since 4*4=16\u22611 mod5.\n\nSo c \u22613 *4 mod5 \u2192 c \u226112 mod5 \u219212 mod5 is 2. So c must be \u22612 mod5. So possible c's are 2,7,12, etc.\n\nSo the smallest c is 2. So the minimum number is 2, which is option C.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me make sure. The problem says \"the minimum number of copper coins\", so the answer is 2. So the correct option is C.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, the options are A)4, B)3, C)2, D)1, E)0. So C is 2, which is the minimum. So that's the answer.\n",

Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says that a coin-diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin she brings up from the river. And for each brass coin, she gets 25 cents. After one dive, she earned $3.40. The question is asking for the minimum number of copper coins she could have brought. The options are from A to E, with E being 0. Hmm.\n\nAlright, so I need to find the minimum number of copper coins. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, let's convert $3.40 into cents because the pay per coin is in cents. $1 is 100 cents, so $3.40 is 340 cents. That makes the calculations easier.\n\nSo, the total earnings are 340 cents. Let's say she brought 'c' copper coins and 'b' brass coins. Then, the total earnings can be written as:\n\n20c + 25b = 340\n\nI need to find the possible values of c and b that satisfy this equation, and then find the minimum c possible.\n\nHmm, okay, so I can rearrange this equation to solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for b in terms of c.\n\n25b = 340 - 20c  \nb = (340 - 20c) / 25\n\nSince the number of coins can't be negative, both c and b must be non-negative integers. So, (340 - 20c) must be divisible by 25, and the result must be a non-negative integer.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can find possible c values that make (340 - 20c) divisible by 25.\n\nAnother approach is to note that 20c +25b =340 can be simplified. Let's see, both 20 and 25 are multiples of 5. So, I can divide the entire equation by 5:\n\n4c +5b =68\n\nAh, that's simpler. So, 4c +5b =68. Now, c and b must be integers >=0.\n\nSo, we can think of this as a linear Diophantine equation. The goal is to find non-negative integer solutions (c, b) to this equation, and then find the minimum c.\n\nHow do I find such solutions? I think I can express one variable in terms of the other. Let's express b in terms of c.\n\n5b = 68 -4c  \nb = (68 -4c)/5\n\nSince b must be an integer, (68 -4c) must be divisible by 5. Let me write 68 as 65 +3, which is 13*5 +3. So,\n\n(68 -4c) mod5 =0  \nWhich means (68 mod5 -4c mod5) =0  \n68 mod5 is 3, since 5*13=65, 68-65=3.  \nSo, 3 - (4c mod5) =0  \nWhich implies 4c mod5 =3.\n\nHmm, so 4c \u22613 mod5. Let me solve for c mod5.\n\nMultiplying both sides by the modular inverse of 4 mod5. Since 4*4=16\u22611 mod5, the inverse is 4.\n\nSo, c \u22613 *4 mod5  \nc \u226112 mod5  \n12 mod5 is 2. So c \u22612 mod5.\n\nThat means c can be written as 5k +2, where k is a non-negative integer (since c can't be negative). Now, let's plug this into the equation for b.\n\nc=5k +2  \nSo,\n\n4*(5k+2) +5b =68  \n20k +8 +5b=68  \n20k +5b =60  \nDivide everything by 5:  \n4k +b =12  \nSo, b=12 -4k.\n\nSince b must be non-negative, 12-4k >=0  \nWhich implies 4k <=12  \nk <=3.\n\nSo k can be 0,1,2,3.\n\nNow, let's find possible (c, b) pairs:\n\nk=0:  \nc=5*0 +2=2  \nb=12-4*0=12  \nSo, c=2, b=12.\n\nk=1:  \nc=5+2=7  \nb=12-4=8  \nc=7, b=8.\n\nk=2:  \nc=10+2=12  \nb=12-8=4  \nc=12, b=4.\n\nk=3:  \nc=15+2=17  \nb=12-12=0  \nc=17, b=0.\n\nThese are all possible solutions because when k=4, c=22, but then b=12-16= -4, which is invalid. So, k can only be up to 3.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the minimum number of copper coins. So looking at the c values: 2,7,12,17. The smallest is 2. So the minimum c is 2. But wait, the options include 2 as option C. But wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait a minute, is there a solution with c=2? Let me plug back into the original equation.\n\n20*2 +25*12 =40 +300=340. Yes, that's correct. So she could have brought 2 copper coins and 12 brass coins.\n\nBut wait, the question is the minimum number of copper coins. So 2 is the minimum possible? Are there any other possibilities where c is smaller than 2? Let's see.\n\nWait, in our earlier approach, we found that c must be congruent to 2 mod5, so possible c's are 2,7,12,17, etc. So the smallest possible c is 2. So the answer would be 2, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. What if the number of brass coins is zero? Then c would be 17, which is larger. So 2 is indeed the smallest.\n\nBut wait, wait another thought. Let me try to see if there's a way to have c less than 2, like c=0 or c=1.\n\nIf c=0, then 25b=340. 340 divided by 25 is 13.6, which isn't an integer. So b would be 13.6, which is impossible because you can't have a fraction of a coin. So c=0 isn't possible.\n\nWhat about c=1? Then 20*1 +25b=340  \n20 +25b=340  \n25b=320  \nb=320/25=12.8. Again, not an integer. So c=1 isn't possible.\n\nSo the next possible c is 2, which works. So the minimum number of copper coins is 2. So the answer is C.\n",

So,\n\n(68 -4c) mod5 =0  \nWhich means (68 mod5 -4c mod5) =0  \n68 mod5 is 3, since 5*13=65, 68-65=3.  \nSo, 3 - (4c mod5) =0  \nWhich implies 4c mod5 =3.\n\nHmm, so 4c \u22613 mod5. Let me solve for c mod5.\n\nMultiplying both sides by the modular inverse of 4 mod5. Since 4*4=16\u22611 mod5, the inverse is 4.\n\nSo, c \u22613 *4 mod5  \nc \u226112 mod5  \n12 mod5 is 2. So c \u22612 mod5.\n\nThat means c can be written as 5k +2, where k is a non-negative integer (since c can't be negative). Now, let's plug this into the equation for b.\n\nc=5k +2  \nSo,\n\n4*(5k+2) +5b =68  \n20k +8 +5b=68  \n20k +5b =60  \nDivide everything by 5:  \n4k +b =12  \nSo, b=12 -4k.\n\nSince b must be non-negative, 12-4k >=0  \nWhich implies 4k <=12  \nk <=3.\n\nSo k can be 0,1,2,3.\n\nNow, let's find possible (c, b) pairs:\n\nk=0:  \nc=5*0 +2=2  \nb=12-4*0=12  \nSo, c=2, b=12.\n\nk=1:  \nc=5+2=7  \nb=12-4=8  \nc=7, b=8.\n\nk=2:  \nc=10+2=12  \nb=12-8=4  \nc=12, b=4.\n\nk=3:  \nc=15+2=17  \nb=12-12=0  \nc=17, b=0.\n\nThese are all possible solutions because when k=4, c=22, but then b=12-16= -4, which is invalid. So, k can only be up to 3.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the minimum number of copper coins. So looking at the c values: 2,7,12,17. The smallest is 2. So the minimum c is 2. But wait, the options include 2 as option C. But wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait a minute, is there a solution with c=2? Let me plug back into the original equation.\n\n20*2 +25*12 =40 +300=340. Yes, that's correct. So she could have brought 2 copper coins and 12 brass coins.\n\nBut wait, the question is the minimum number of copper coins. So 2 is the minimum possible? Are there any other possibilities where c is smaller than 2? Let's see.\n\nWait, in our earlier approach, we found that c must be congruent to 2 mod5, so possible c's are 2,7,12,17, etc. So the smallest possible c is 2. So the answer would be 2, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. What if the number of brass coins is zero? Then c would be 17, which is larger. So 2 is indeed the smallest.\n\nBut wait, wait another thought. Let me try to see if there's a way to have c less than 2, like c=0 or c=1.\n\nIf c=0, then 25b=340. 340 divided by 25 is 13.6, which isn't an integer. So b would be 13.6, which is impossible because you can't have a fraction of a coin. So c=0 isn't possible.\n\nWhat about c=1? Then 20*1 +25b=340  \n20 +25b=340  \n25b=320  \nb=320/25=12.8. Again, not an integer. So c=1 isn't possible.\n\nSo the next possible c is 2, which works. So the minimum number of copper coins is 2. So the answer is C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by converting $3.40 into cents, which gives 340 cents. The total earnings can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n20c + 25b = 340\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( c \\) is the number of copper coins and \\( b \\) is the number of brass coins. Both \\( c \\) and \\( b \\) must be non-negative integers. Simplifying the equation by dividing through by 5:\n\n\\[\n4c + 5b = 68\n\\]\n\nWe solve for \\( b \\) in terms of \\( c \\):\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{68 - 4c}{5}\n\\]\n\nFor \\( b \\) to be an integer, \\( 68 - 4c \\) must be divisible by 5. This implies:\n\n\\[\n4c \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}\n\\]\n\nThe modular inverse of 4 modulo 5 is 4, so multiplying both sides by 4:\n\n\\[\nc \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( c \\) can be written as \\( c = 5k + 2 \\), where \\( k \\) is a non-negative integer. Substituting \\( c = 5k + 2 \\) into the equation for \\( b \\):\n\n\\[\nb = 12 - 4k\n\\]\n\nSince \\( b \\) must be non-negative, \\( 12 - 4k \\geq 0 \\), which gives \\( k \\leq 3 \\). Therefore, \\( k \\) can take the values 0, 1, 2, or 3, leading to the following solutions:\n\n- \\( k = 0 \\): \\( c = 2 \\), \\( b = 12 \\)\n- \\( k = 1 \\): \\( c = 7 \\), \\( b = 8 \\)\n- \\( k = 2 \\): \\( c = 12 \\), \\( b = 4 \\)\n- \\( k = 3 \\): \\( c = 17 \\), \\( b = 0 \\)\n\nThe smallest value of \\( c \\) is 2. Checking smaller values like \\( c = 0 \\) or \\( c = 1 \\) results in non-integer values for \\( b \\), confirming that the minimum number of copper coins is indeed 2.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. \n\nThe question is about a coin diver who gets money for bringing up coins from a river. She gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin. After one dive, she earned $3.40. The question is asking for the minimum number of copper coins she could have brought. The options are A)4, B)3, C)2, D)1, E)0.\n\nHmm, so I need to find the smallest possible number of copper coins. That probably means I should maximize the number of brass coins because they give more money per coin. But wait, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's convert the total money she got into cents because the pay per coin is in cents. $3.40 is 340 cents. So, the total is 340 cents.\n\nLet me define some variables to make it clearer. Let me call the number of copper coins 'c' and the number of brass coins 'b'. So, the total money she made would be 20c + 25b = 340 cents.\n\nI need to find the minimum value of 'c' such that both 'c' and 'b' are non-negative integers. Because you can't have a negative number of coins, right?\n\nSo, the equation is 20c + 25b = 340. I can simplify this equation to find possible integer solutions.\n\nLet me try to rearrange it. Maybe I can express it in terms of one variable. Let's solve for 'b' in terms of 'c'.\n\n25b = 340 - 20c\n\nDivide both sides by 5 to make it simpler:\n\n5b = 68 - 4c\n\nSo, 5b = 68 -4c. Hmm. Or, b = (68 -4c)/5.\n\nSince 'b' has to be an integer, (68 -4c) must be divisible by 5. So, (68 -4c) mod 5 should be zero.\n\nLet's find what 68 mod 5 is. 5*13=65, so 68-65=3. So 68 mod5 is 3. So, 68-4c \u2261 0 mod5 \u2192 3 -4c mod5 \u22610.\n\nWhich implies, -4c \u2261 -3 mod5 \u2192 4c \u22613 mod5.\n\nWait, let's solve 4c \u22613 mod5.\n\nWhat values of c satisfy this?\n\nI can think about the possible c values from 0 upwards and see which make 4c mod5 equal 3.\n\nLet's compute 4c mod5 for c=0 to 4:\n\nc=0: 0 mod5 \u2192 0\nc=1:4 mod5 \u21924\nc=2:8 mod5 \u21923 \u2192 yes, because 8-5=3.\nSo when c=2, 4c mod5 is 3.\n\nThen, the next solution would be when c is 2 + 5k, where k is a non-negative integer (since we're looking for the minimum c, we'll take the smallest possible).\n\nSo, the solutions for c are c=2,7,12,... etc.\n\nBut wait, we need to ensure that 'b' is also a non-negative integer.\n\nSo, for c=2:\n\nb=(68-4*2)/5 = (68-8)/5=60/5=12. So b=12, which is an integer and positive. That's valid.\n\nWhat if c is the next possible value, c=7?\n\nThen, b=(68 -4*7)/5 = (68-28)/5=40/5=8. So b=8. Still positive.\n\nBut since we're looking for the minimum c, the smallest possible c is 2, right?\n\nWait, but let me check if c=2 is the minimum. What about c=0? Because the question is asking for the minimum number of copper coins, which could be zero if possible.\n\nLet's try c=0. Then, b= (68 -0)/5=68/5=13.6. Oh wait, that's 13.6, which isn't an integer. So that's not allowed. So c can't be 0.\n\nSo the next possible c is 2, as we saw earlier. Let me check other possible c values less than 2, but since c is a non-negative integer, the only options are 0 and 2 and higher. So c=0 doesn't work, so the minimum is c=2.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check if c can be 1. Because 2 is the first solution, but perhaps there's a smaller c that also satisfies the equation. Let me see.\n\nWhen c=1:\n\nb=(68 -4*1)/5=64/5=12.8 \u2192 which is 12.8, not an integer. So that's invalid.\n\nc=3:\n\nb=(68-12)/5=56/5=11.2 \u2192 nope.\n\nc=4:\n\nb=(68-16)/5=52/5=10.4 \u2192 nope.\n\nc=5:\n\n68-20=48 \u219248/5=9.6\u2192 nope.\n\nc=6:\n\n68-24=44 \u219244/5=8.8\u2192 nope.\n\nc=7:\n\n68-28=40 \u219240/5=8\u2192 yes, so c=7 gives b=8.\n\nBut wait, the problem is about the minimum c, so the smallest possible c is 2, right?\n\nSo the answer should be c=2. Which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me re-examine the modular equation.\n\nThe equation was 4c \u22613 mod5.\n\nPossible solutions for c are numbers where 4c mod5 is 3.\n\nWe found that when c=2, 4*2=8\u21928 mod5 is 3. So yes.\n\nNext solution is c=2 +5=7, as we saw.\n\nSo the possible c's are 2,7,12, etc. But since we're looking for the minimum, it's 2.\n\nSo the answer is 2, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. What if I approach it differently.\n\nWe can model the problem as 20c +25b=340.\n\nLet's factor out 5: 5*(4c +5b) =5*68 \u2192 4c +5b=68.\n\nSo, 4c +5b=68.\n\nWe need to find non-negative integers c and b such that this holds, and find the minimum c.\n\nSo, 4c =68 -5b \u2192 4c must be equal to 68-5b.\n\nSince 4c must be non-negative, 68-5b must be \u22650 \u2192 5b \u226468 \u2192 b \u226413.6 \u2192 b can be up to 13.\n\nSo, possible b values from 0 to13.\n\nWe can express c in terms of b: c=(68-5b)/4.\n\nc must be an integer, so (68-5b) must be divisible by 4.\n\nWhich means 68-5b \u22610 mod4.\n\n68 mod4 is 0 (since 4*17=68).\n\nSo, 5b mod4 must be 0 \u2192 5b \u22610 mod4.\n\nBut 5 mod4 is 1, so 1*b \u22610 mod4 \u2192 b \u22610 mod4.\n\nSo, b must be a multiple of 4. So possible b values are 0,4,8,12.\n\nLet me check each of these.\n\nb=0: c=(68-0)/4=17 \u2192 c=17.\n\nb=4: (68-20)/4=48/4=12 \u2192 c=12.\n\nb=8: (68-40)/4=28/4=7 \u2192 c=7.\n\nb=12: (68-60)/4=8/4=2 \u2192 c=2.\n\nb=16: 5*16=80>68 \u2192 no.\n\nSo the possible (b,c) pairs are (0,17), (4,12), (8,7), (12,2).\n\nSo, the possible c values are 17,12,7,2.\n\nThe minimum c is 2.\n\nSo, the answer is 2, which is option C.\n\nThat seems consistent with what I found earlier.\n",

Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question is about a coin diver who gets paid for bringing up coins from a river. She gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin. After one dive, she earned $3.40. The question is asking for the minimum number of copper coins she could have brought up.\n\nThe options are A)4, B)3, C)2, D)1, E)0. So the possible answers range from 0 to 4 copper coins. I'm supposed to find the smallest number of copper coins that could result in her making exactly $3.40.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. First, I should convert the total amount she earned into cents to avoid dealing with decimals. Since $1 is 100 cents, $3.40 is 340 cents.\n\nSo she earned 340 cents. Let's denote the number of copper coins as 'c' and the number of brass coins as 'b'. Then, each copper coin gives 20 cents, so total from copper is 20c. Each brass gives 25, so total from brass is 25b. The sum is 340 cents.\n\nSo the equation is 20c + 25b = 340.\n\nI need to find the minimum value of 'c' such that both 'c' and 'b' are non-negative integers. Because you can't have a negative number of coins.\n\nSo, the equation is 20c +25b = 340.\n\nI can simplify this equation a bit. Let's see if I can factor out a common factor. Both 20 and 25 are divisible by 5. So dividing both sides by 5 gives:\n\n4c +5b = 68.\n\nNow, that's a simpler equation: 4c +5b = 68.\n\nI need to find non-negative integers c and b that satisfy this, and find the smallest possible c.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to solving for c and b in 4c +5b=68, with c and b being integers >=0.\n\nI think the approach here is to express one variable in terms of the other and see for which values both are integers.\n\nLet me solve for b in terms of c. So,\n\n5b = 68 -4c\nb = (68 -4c)/5\n\nSince b must be an integer, (68 -4c) must be divisible by 5.\n\nWhich means, 68 -4c \u2261 0 mod 5.\n\nLet me compute 68 mod 5. 5*13=65, so 68-65=3. So 68 mod5 is 3.\n\nSo 68 -4c \u2261 0 mod5 \u2192 3 -4c mod5 \u22610 \u2192 So, 4c \u22613 mod5.\n\nWait, because 68 mod5 is 3, so 3 -4c \u22610 \u2192 4c \u22613 mod5.\n\nNow, I need to find c such that 4c mod5 is 3.\n\nSo, what is 4c mod5 equal to 3? Let's find c.\n\nWe can think about possible c values from 0 upwards and see when 4c mod5 is 3.\n\nLet me compute 4c mod5 for c=0,1,2,3,4,5, etc.\n\nc=0: 0 \u2192 0 mod5 \u2192 0 \u2192 no.\nc=1:4 \u21924 mod5=4 \u2192 no.\nc=2:8 mod5=3 \u2192 yes! Because 8-5=3. So 4*2=8, which mod5 is 3.\n\nSo c=2 is a solution. Then, c=2 would be the first possible value. Wait, but wait: let's see if there are smaller c values than that.\n\nWait, the possible c's are 0,1,2,3,4,5, etc. So for c=0: 4*0=0 \u21920 mod5=0\u22603. So no.\n\nc=1: 4 \u21924 mod5=4\u22603.\n\nc=2: 8 mod5=3 \u2192 yes. So that's the first c where 4c mod5=3.\n\nSo the minimal c is 2? But wait, let's check if that gives a valid b.\n\nSo with c=2, what is b?\n\nb=(68 -4c)/5 = (68-8)/5=60/5=12. So b=12, which is an integer. So that's valid.\n\nSo when c=2, b=12. That gives 20*2 +25*12=40 + 300=340. Yep, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the minimum number of copper coins, which is the smallest c possible. So I thought c=2 is the first possible. But let's check if c can be 0.\n\nWait, if c=0, then 4c=0 \u21925b=68 \u2192b=13.6 \u2192 which is not integer. So c=0 is invalid.\n\nSo next is c=1: 4*1=4 \u21925b=68-4=64 \u2192b=12.8 \u2192 not integer. So no.\n\nc=2: as above, works. So c=2 is possible. So the minimal number is 2.\n\nWait, but wait: the options include 0,1,2,3,4. So the answer would be C)2.\n\nBut let me make sure that there's no c less than 2 that works. Because perhaps I made a mistake in the mod calculation.\n\nWait, let's see: 4c \u22613 mod5.\n\nWe can solve for c:\n\n4c \u22613 mod5 \u2192 multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 4 mod5. Since 4*4=16\u22611 mod5, so the inverse is 4.\n\nSo, c \u22613 *4 mod5 \u2192 c \u226112 mod5 \u2192 c\u22612 mod5.\n\nSo c can be 2,7,12, etc. But since we're looking for the smallest c, the minimal c is 2.\n\nSo in this case, c=2 is the minimal number of copper coins.\n\nWait, but let's see if there's a scenario where c is 7, but that would give a higher c, which we don't want. So the minimal is 2.\n\nSo the answer would be C)2.\n",

Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe question says: A coin-diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin she brings up from the bottom of a river. After one dive, she earned $3.40. The question is asking for the minimum number of copper coins she could have brought. The options are A)4, B)3, C)2, D)1, E)0.\n\nHmm, so I need to find the smallest number of copper coins possible, given that the total she earned is $3.40, which is 340 cents. Let me think about how to model this.\n\nLet's denote the number of copper coins as 'c' and the number of brass coins as 'b'. Each copper gives 20 cents, so total for copper is 20c. Each brass gives 25 cents, so total for brass is 25b. The sum should be 340 cents. So the equation is:\n\n20c + 25b = 340\n\nI think the goal is to find the minimum value of 'c' such that both 'c' and 'b' are non-negative integers. Because you can't have a negative number of coins, right?\n\nSo I need to solve for 'c' and 'b' where both are integers >= 0, and find the smallest possible 'c'.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation to express 'b' in terms of 'c' or vice versa. Maybe express 'b' as:\n\n25b = 340 - 20c\n\nSo, b = (340 - 20c)/25\n\nSimplify that. Let's see, 340 divided by 25 is... 340 /25 = 13.6. Hmm, but 20c is subtracted from that. Let me think in terms of factors.\n\nWait, maybe I can factor out 5. Because 20 and 25 are both multiples of 5. Let me try:\n\n20c +25b = 340\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\n4c +5b = 68\n\nThat's a simpler equation. So 4c +5b = 68.\n\nNow, I need to find integer solutions (c, b) where c and b are non-negative, and find the minimal c.\n\nSo, I can express this as 5b = 68 -4c.\n\nWhich means 68 -4c must be divisible by 5, and the result must be non-negative.\n\nSo, 68 -4c \u22610 mod5.\n\nLet me compute 68 mod5: 5*13=65, so 68-65=3. So 68 \u22613 mod5.\n\nSo, 3 -4c \u22610 mod5 \u2192 4c \u22613 mod5.\n\nI need to solve for c in this congruence: 4c \u22613 mod5.\n\nLet me find the multiplicative inverse of 4 modulo5. Since 4*4=16\u22611 mod5, so inverse is 4.\n\nMultiply both sides by 4: c \u2261 3*4 mod5 \u2192 c \u226112 mod5 \u2192 c\u22612 mod5.\n\nSo c can be written as 5k +2, where k is a non-negative integer.\n\nSo possible values for c are 2,7,12,... but wait, since 4c can't exceed 68, because 4c=68-5b, which must be >=0.\n\nSo 4c <=68 \u2192 c <=17.\n\nSo possible c values are 2,7,12,17.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Because c=5k+2, and k=0 gives 2, k=1 gives7, etc.\n\nSo the minimal c would be 2, but let me check if that works.\n\nLet me plug c=2 into the equation 4c +5b=68.\n\n4*2=8, so 5b=60 \u2192 b=12. So b=12 is an integer, so that's a valid solution.\n\nSo that would mean the minimum number of copper coins is 2. But wait, let me see if lower c is possible. Wait, the congruence says c must be 2 mod5, so the next possible lower c would be 2-5= -3, which is negative. Not possible. So the smallest possible c is 2.\n\nWait, but the options include E)0, D)1, etc. So perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me try to find all possible c values starting from 0 upwards and see if they give integer b.\n\nSo starting with c=0: 4*0 +5b=68 \u21925b=68 \u2192 b=13.6 \u2192 not integer. So no.\n\nc=1: 4*1=4 \u21925b=64 \u219264/5=12.8 \u2192 not integer.\n\nc=2: 4*2=8 \u21925b=60 \u2192b=12 \u2192 valid.\n\nc=3: 4*3=12 \u21925b=56 \u219256/5=11.2 \u2192 no.\n\nc=4: 4*4=16 \u21925b=52 \u219252/5=10.4 \u2192 no.\n\nc=5: 20 \u21925b=48 \u219248/5=9.6 \u2192 no.\n\nc=6: 24 \u21925b=44 \u219244/5=8.8 \u2192 no.\n\nc=7: 28 \u21925b=40 \u2192b=8 \u2192 yes.\n\nWait, so for c=2, b=12; c=7, b=8; c=12, b=4; c=17, b=0.\n\nWait, so the possible c values are 2,7,12,17.\n\nSo the minimal c is 2, which is option C.\n\nWait, but the question is about the minimum number of copper coins.

The options are A)4, B)3, C)2, D)1, E)0.\n\nSo the correct answer is C)2.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Let me make sure I didn't miss any smaller c.\n\nWait, when c=2, it works. Is there a way to have c=1? Let me see.\n\nIf c=1, then 20*1=20. So the total from copper is 20 cents. Then the rest is 340-20=320 cents from brass. 320/25=12.8, which is not an integer.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe question says: A coin-diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin she brings up from the bottom of a river. After one dive, she earned $3.40. The question is asking for the minimum number of copper coins she could have brought. The options are A)4, B)3, C)2, D)1, E)0.\n\nHmm, so I need to find the smallest number of copper coins possible, given that the total she earned is $3.40, which is 340 cents. Let me think about how to model this.\n\nLet's denote the number of copper coins as 'c' and the number of brass coins as 'b'. Each copper gives 20 cents, so total for copper is 20c. Each brass gives 25 cents, so total for brass is 25b. The sum should be 340 cents. So the equation is:\n\n20c + 25b = 340\n\nI think the goal is to find the minimum value of 'c' such that both 'c' and 'b' are non-negative integers. Because you can't have a negative number of coins, right?\n\nSo I need to solve for 'c' and 'b' where both are integers >= 0, and find the smallest possible 'c'.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation to express 'b' in terms of 'c' or vice versa. Maybe express 'b' as:\n\n25b = 340 - 20c\n\nSo, b = (340 - 20c)/25\n\nSimplify that. Let's see, 340 divided by 25 is... 340 /25 = 13.6. Hmm, but 20c is subtracted from that. Let me think in terms of factors.\n\nWait, maybe I can factor out 5. Because 20 and 25 are both multiples of 5. Let me try:\n\n20c +25b = 340\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\n4c +5b = 68\n\nThat's a simpler equation. So 4c +5b = 68.\n\nNow, I need to find integer solutions (c, b) where c and b are non-negative, and find the minimal c.\n\nSo, I can express this as 5b = 68 -4c.\n\nWhich means 68 -4c must be divisible by 5, and the result must be non-negative.\n\nSo, 68 -4c \u22610 mod5.\n\nLet me compute 68 mod5: 5*13=65, so 68-65=3. So 68 \u22613 mod5.\n\nSo, 3 -4c \u22610 mod5 \u2192 4c \u22613 mod5.\n\nI need to solve for c in this congruence: 4c \u22613 mod5.\n\nLet me find the multiplicative inverse of 4 modulo5. Since 4*4=16\u22611 mod5, so inverse is 4.\n\nMultiply both sides by 4: c \u2261 3*4 mod5 \u2192 c \u226112 mod5 \u2192 c\u22612 mod5.\n\nSo c can be written as 5k +2, where k is a non-negative integer.\n\nSo possible values for c are 2,7,12,... but wait, since 4c can't exceed 68, because 4c=68-5b, which must be >=0.\n\nSo 4c <=68 \u2192 c <=17.\n\nSo possible c values are 2,7,12,17.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Because c=5k+2, and k=0 gives 2, k=1 gives7, etc.\n\nSo the minimal c would be 2, but let me check if that works.\n\nLet me plug c=2 into the equation 4c +5b=68.\n\n4*2=8, so 5b=60 \u2192 b=12. So b=12 is an integer, so that's a valid solution.\n\nSo that would mean the minimum number of copper coins is 2. But wait, let me see if lower c is possible. Wait, the congruence says c must be 2 mod5, so the next possible lower c would be 2-5= -3, which is negative. Not possible. So the smallest possible c is 2.\n\nWait, but the options include E)0, D)1, etc. So perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me try to find all possible c values starting from 0 upwards and see if they give integer b.\n\nSo starting with c=0: 4*0 +5b=68 \u21925b=68 \u2192 b=13.6 \u2192 not integer. So no.\n\nc=1: 4*1=4 \u21925b=64 \u219264/5=12.8 \u2192 not integer.\n\nc=2: 4*2=8 \u21925b=60 \u2192b=12 \u2192 valid.\n\nc=3: 4*3=12 \u21925b=56 \u219256/5=11.2 \u2192 no.\n\nc=4: 4*4=16 \u21925b=52 \u219252/5=10.4 \u2192 no.\n\nc=5: 20 \u21925b=48 \u219248/5=9.6 \u2192 no.\n\nc=6: 24 \u21925b=44 \u219244/5=8.8 \u2192 no.\n\nc=7: 28 \u21925b=40 \u2192b=8 \u2192 yes.\n\nWait, so for c=2, b=12; c=7, b=8; c=12, b=4; c=17, b=0.\n\nWait, so the possible c values are 2,7,12,17.\n\nSo the minimal c is 2, which is option C.\n\nWait, but the question is about the minimum number of copper coins. So the answer would be 2, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. Let me check the original problem again. The options are A)4, B)3, C)2, D)1, E)0.\n\nSo the correct answer is C)2.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Let me make sure I didn't miss any smaller c.\n\nWait, when c=2, it works. Is there a way to have c=1? Let me see.\n\nIf c=1, then 20*1=20. So the total from copper is 20 cents. Then the rest is 340-20=320 cents from brass. 320/25=12.8, which is not an integer. So no.\n\nSimilarly, c=0: 340/25=13.6 \u2192 no.\n\nSo the minimal c is 2, which is option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let the number of copper coins be \\( c \\) and the number of brass coins be \\( b \\).

This implies:\n\n\\[\n68 - 4c \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying \\( 68 \\mod 5 \\), we find \\( 68 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5} \\). Thus:\n\n\\[\n3 - 4c \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 4c \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}\n\\]\n\nThe multiplicative inverse of 4 modulo 5 is 4, since \\( 4 \\times 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5} \\).

Maybe I can express the equation in terms of one variable. Let's see.\n\n20c + 25b = 340.\n\nI can try to simplify this equation. Both 20 and 25 are divisible by 5.

Let's try solving for b.\n\n5b = 68 - 4c.\n\nSo, b = (68 -4c)/5.\n\nSince both b and c have to be non-negative integers (you can't have a negative number of coins or a fraction of a coin), (68 -4c) must be divisible by 5, and the result must be a non-negative integer.\n\nSo, let's think about what values of c make (68 -4c) divisible by 5.\n\nAnother way to look at this is: 68 -4c \u2261 0 mod5.\n\nSo, 68 mod5 is 3 because 5*13=65, 68-65=3.

The inverse of 4 mod5 is 4, because 4*4=16 \u22611 mod5.\n\nSo, multiply both sides by 4: (4*4)c \u2261 3*4 mod5 \u2192 16c \u226112 mod5 \u2192 16 mod5 is 1, so 1c \u2261 12 mod5. 12 mod5 is 2, so c \u22612 mod5.\n\nSo c must be congruent to 2 mod5.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a coin diver who gets paid for bringing up coins. Hmm, let's see. The question says she gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin. After one dive, she earned $3.40. The question is asking for the minimum number of copper coins she could have brought up.\n\nWait, so I need to find the smallest possible number of copper coins. That probably means I should maximize the number of brass coins since they give more money per coin. Because more brass coins would mean fewer copper coins needed to reach the total, right?\n\nLet me break this down. So each copper coin is 20 cents, each brass is 25. The total she made is $3.40, which is 340 cents. Let's denote the number of copper coins as c and brass coins as b. Then the equation would be 20c + 25b = 340.\n\nI need to find non-negative integer solutions for c and b. And we're looking for the minimum c, so I want to maximize b as much as possible.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can express the equation in terms of one variable. Let's solve for c:\n\n20c = 340 - 25b\nc = (340 -25b)/20\n\nSince c has to be an integer, (340 -25b) must be divisible by 20. Let me see what that implies.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about this as a Diophantine equation. So 20c +25b =340.\n\nWait, 20 and 25 have a greatest common divisor (gcd) of 5. Let me check if 5 divides 340. 340 divided by 5 is 68, so yes. That means there are solutions.\n\nWe can simplify the equation by dividing everything by 5:\n\n4c +5b = 68.\n\nNow, the equation is 4c +5b =68. We need to find non-negative integers c and b.\n\nWe can express this as 4c =68 -5b. So 68 -5b must be divisible by 4.\n\nLet me think about 68 mod 4. 68 divided by 4 is 17, so 68 mod 4 is 0. So 5b must be congruent to 0 mod 4 as well because 68-5b must be divisible by 4.\n\nWait, 5 mod 4 is 1. So 5b mod4 is same as (1*b) mod4, which is b mod4. So 68 -5b mod4 = 0- (b mod4) = (-b mod4) =0. So that implies that b mod4 must be 0. So b must be a multiple of 4.\n\nSo possible values for b are 0,4,8,... up to the maximum where 5b <=68.\n\nLet's find the maximum possible b. 5b <=68 \u2192 b<=13.6, so b can be up to 13. But since b must be a multiple of 4, the maximum possible is 12 (since 4*13=52, 5*13=65, which is less than 68? Wait no, 5*13 is 65, which is less than 68. Wait, 68-5b must be positive or zero. So 5b <=68 \u2192 b<=13.6, so maximum b is 13.\n\nBut since b must be a multiple of 4, the possible b's are 0,4,8,12.\n\nLet me compute for each possible b and find the corresponding c, then see which gives the smallest c.\n\nStart with the largest possible b to minimize c.\n\nCase 1: b=12.\n\nPlug into 4c +5*12=68 \u21924c +60=68 \u21924c=8 \u2192c=2.\n\nSo c=2. That's a possible solution.\n\nCase 2: b=8.\n\n4c +5*8=68 \u21924c +40=68 \u21924c=28 \u2192c=7.\n\nThat's c=7, which is higher than 2. So not better.\n\nCase 3: b=4.\n\n4c +20=68 \u21924c=48 \u2192c=12.\n\nWhich is even higher.\n\nCase 4: b=0.\n\n4c=68 \u2192c=17. That's a lot of copper coins, but the problem asks for the minimum c, so 2 is better.\n\nWait, but wait. Are there any other possible values of b that are not multiples of 4 but still satisfy the condition?\n\nHmm, earlier I thought that because 5b must be congruent to 0 mod4, because 68 is 0 mod4. But 5b mod4 is equal to (5 mod4)*(b mod4) \u2192 which is 1*(b mod4). So 5b mod4 is b mod4. So 68-5b \u22610 mod4 \u2192 0 - (b mod4) \u22610 \u2192 which implies that b mod4=0. So yes, b must be a multiple of 4. So the only possible b's are 0,4,8,12.\n\nSo the maximum possible b is 12, leading to c=2.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let's see if there are other possibilities beyond the multiples of 4. Because sometimes when you have equations like this, maybe there are other constraints I'm missing.\n\nWait, but from the equation 4c +5b=68 and the fact that 5b must be congruent to 0 mod4, because 4c is 0 mod4, and 68 is 0 mod4, so 5b must also be 0 mod4. So yes, b must be a multiple of 4.\n\nSo the only possible b's are 0,4,8,12.\n\nSo the maximum b is 12, leading to c=2.\n\nWait, but let's check if that's correct.\n\nIf she brings 12 brass coins, each is 25 cents, so 12*25=300 cents. Then the rest is 340-300=40 cents, which is 2 copper coins (2*20=40). So yes, that adds up correctly.\n\nNow, the question is the minimum number of copper coins. So 2 is the smallest possible, but wait, wait a minute\u2014can we get a lower c?\n\nWait, what if she brings more than 12 brass coins? Let's see. What's the maximum possible number of brass coins she can bring? Let's calculate.\n\nTotal money is 340 cents. Each brass is 25. So maximum possible b is 340//25=13.6 \u219213. But earlier, we saw that b must be a multiple of 4. So the next possible after 12 would be 16, but 16*25=400, which is more than 340, so that's impossible. So the next possible is 12, then 8, etc.\n\nWait, but wait. If b=13, which is not a multiple of 4, would that work?\n\nLet me try b=13. Then 5b=65. 68-65=3. So 4c=3 \u2192 c=0.75. But that's not an integer. So no solution for b=13.\n\nSimilarly, for b=11: 5*11=55. 68-55=13. 13/4=3.25 \u2192 no.\n\nb=10: 5*10=50. 68-50=18. 18/4=4.5 \u2192 no.\n\nb=9:45 \u219268-45=23 \u219223/4=5.75 \u2192 no.\n\nb=7:35 \u219268-35=33 \u219233/4=8.25 \u2192 no.\n\nSo no, the only possible b's are multiples of 4. So the maximum b is 12, leading to c=2.\n\nSo the minimum number of copper coins is 2.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me check the possible b=12, c=2.\n\n20*2 +25*12 =40 +300=340. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the minimum number of copper coins is 2. So the answer should be option C)2.\n\nBut let me make sure there are no other possible combinations with a smaller c. Let's think, is there a way to have c=1 or 0?\n\nIf c=1, then 20 +25b=340 \u219225b=320 \u2192b=12.8. But b must be integer, so no solution here.\n\nc=0: 25b=340 \u2192b=13.6 \u2192 not integer. So no.\n\nSo the next possible c is 2, which works. So yes, the minimum is 2.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about a coin diver who gets paid for bringing up coins from a river. She gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin. After one dive, she made $3.40. The question is asking for the minimum number of copper coins she could have brought up.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. So, she could have a mix of copper and brass coins. The total she earned is $3.40, which is 340 cents. Each copper is 20c, brass is 25c. So we're looking for two numbers, the number of copper coins (let's say c) and brass coins (b), such that 20c + 25b = 340. And we need the minimum c possible.\n\nRight, so the equation is 20c +25b =340. We can simplify this equation. Let's see, maybe divide everything by 5 to make it easier. So, 4c +5b =68. Now, the equation is a bit simpler.\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest possible value of c, which is a non-negative integer, because you can't have a negative number of coins. So we need to find integer solutions (c, b) where c is as small as possible.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Since 5b is a term, perhaps I can express b in terms of c. Let's rearrange the equation:\n\n5b = 68 -4c\nb = (68 -4c)/5\n\nSince b has to be an integer, (68 -4c) must be divisible by 5. So, 68 minus 4c must be a multiple of 5. Let's think about this modulo 5.\n\nLet me compute 68 mod 5. 5*13=65, so 68 is 65 +3, so 68 mod5 is 3. So, 68 -4c \u2261 3 - (4c mod5) \u22610 mod5.\n\nSo 3 -4c mod5 =0 \u2192 4c mod5=3.\n\nWe can think of 4c \u22613 mod5. Let me find c such that this holds. 4 and 5 are coprime, so there's a unique solution modulo5.\n\nWhat's the inverse of 4 mod5? 4*4=16 \u219216 mod5 is 1. So the inverse is 4.\n\nMultiply both sides by 4: c \u2261 (3 *4) mod5 \u2192 12 mod5 is 2. So c \u22612 mod5.\n\nThat means c can be 2, 7, 12, etc. But since c can't be larger than 68/4=17 (since 4c can't exceed 68), let's see possible c values.\n\nWait, let's check the possible c values starting from the smallest possible. Because we're looking for the minimum c, so let's try c=2 first.\n\nIf c=2, then 4c=8, 68-8=60. 60/5=12. So b=12. That's a valid solution. So she could have 2 copper and 12 brass coins, which would give 20*2 +25*12 =40 +300=340. That works.\n\nBut wait, is there a smaller c? Let's see. The next possible c according to the congruence would be 2 +5=7, but that's larger. Wait, but perhaps I should check c=0,1, etc., and see if they work.\n\nWait, let's see.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about a coin diver who gets paid for bringing up coins from a river. She gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin. After one dive, she made $3.40. The question is asking for the minimum number of copper coins she could have brought up.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. So, she could have a mix of copper and brass coins. The total she earned is $3.40, which is 340 cents. Each copper is 20c, brass is 25c. So we're looking for two numbers, the number of copper coins (let's say c) and brass coins (b), such that 20c + 25b = 340. And we need the minimum c possible.\n\nRight, so the equation is 20c +25b =340. We can simplify this equation. Let's see, maybe divide everything by 5 to make it easier. So, 4c +5b =68. Now, the equation is a bit simpler.\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest possible value of c, which is a non-negative integer, because you can't have a negative number of coins. So we need to find integer solutions (c, b) where c is as small as possible.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Since 5b is a term, perhaps I can express b in terms of c. Let's rearrange the equation:\n\n5b = 68 -4c\nb = (68 -4c)/5\n\nSince b has to be an integer, (68 -4c) must be divisible by 5. So, 68 minus 4c must be a multiple of 5. Let's think about this modulo 5.\n\nLet me compute 68 mod 5. 5*13=65, so 68 is 65 +3, so 68 mod5 is 3. So, 68 -4c \u2261 3 - (4c mod5) \u22610 mod5.\n\nSo 3 -4c mod5 =0 \u2192 4c mod5=3.\n\nWe can think of 4c \u22613 mod5. Let me find c such that this holds. 4 and 5 are coprime, so there's a unique solution modulo5.\n\nWhat's the inverse of 4 mod5? 4*4=16 \u219216 mod5 is 1. So the inverse is 4.\n\nMultiply both sides by 4: c \u2261 (3 *4) mod5 \u2192 12 mod5 is 2. So c \u22612 mod5.\n\nThat means c can be 2, 7, 12, etc. But since c can't be larger than 68/4=17 (since 4c can't exceed 68), let's see possible c values.\n\nWait, let's check the possible c values starting from the smallest possible. Because we're looking for the minimum c, so let's try c=2 first.\n\nIf c=2, then 4c=8, 68-8=60. 60/5=12. So b=12. That's a valid solution. So she could have 2 copper and 12 brass coins, which would give 20*2 +25*12 =40 +300=340. That works.\n\nBut wait, is there a smaller c? Let's see. The next possible c according to the congruence would be 2 +5=7, but that's larger. Wait, but perhaps I should check c=0,1, etc., and see if they work.\n\nWait, let's see. Maybe I can find a smaller c than 2 that satisfies the condition.\n\nSo let's try c=0. Then 4c=0. 68-0=68. 68/5=13.6, which is not an integer. So b would be 13.6, which isn't possible. So c=0 isn't valid.\n\nc=1: 4*1=4. 68-4=64. 64/5=12.8. Not integer. So invalid.\n\nc=2: as before, works.\n\nc=3: 4*3=12. 68-12=56. 56/5=11.2 \u2192 not integer.\n\nc=4: 4*4=16. 68-16=52. 52/5=10.4 \u2192 no.\n\nc=5: 4*5=20. 68-20=48. 48/5=9.6 \u2192 no.\n\nc=6: 4*6=24. 68-24=44. 44/5=8.8 \u2192 no.\n\nc=7: 4*7=28. 68-28=40. 40/5=8. So b=8. So another solution. But c is 7 here, which is larger than 2.\n\nSo the minimum c is 2. So the answer is option C)2.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other possibilities. Let me think if there's a way c could be less than 2. Well, c=0 and 1 don't work, so the smallest possible is 2. So the minimum number of copper coins is 2.
