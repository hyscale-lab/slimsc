      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says: If 10 is subtracted from two-thirds of a number, the result is equal to the sum of 40 and one-third of the number. I need to find that number, and the options are A)100, B)160, C)150, D)210, E)220.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. I think I should assign a variable to the unknown number. Let's call the number x.\n\nSo, the first part says, \"10 is subtracted from two-thirds of a number.\" That translates to (2/3) * x minus 10. So, (2/3)x - 10.\n\nThe result of that is equal to the sum of 40 and one-third of the number. So, the right side would be 40 plus (1/3)x. So, 40 + (1/3)x.\n\nPutting it all together, the equation is: (2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x.\n\nNow I need to solve for x. Let's rearrange the equation. I think I should get all the x terms on one side and the constants on the other.\n\nSubtract (1/3)x from both sides to get rid of it on the right. So:\n\n(2/3)x - (1/3)x -10 = 40.\n\nSimplify the x terms: 2/3 minus 1/3 is 1/3, so (1/3)x -10 =40.\n\nNext, add 10 to both sides to isolate the x term:\n\n(1/3)x = 40 +10 \u2192 (1/3)x =50.\n\nNow, to solve for x, multiply both sides by 3:\n\nx =50 *3 \u2192 x=150.\n\nWait, that's one of the options. Option C is 150. So I think the answer is C.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my algebra.\n\nLet me substitute x=150 back into the original problem to see if both sides are equal.\n\nLeft side: (2/3)*150 -10. Let's compute that. 2/3 of 150 is (150/3)*2 =50*2=100. Then subtract 10: 100-10=90.\n\nRight side:40 + (1/3)*150. 1/3 of 150 is 50. So 40+50=90.\n\nYes, both sides are 90. So it checks out. So the number is indeed 150, which is option C.\n",

I need to find the number. The options are A) 100, B) 160, C) 150, D) 210, E) 220.\n\nHmm, okay. Let's break this down. Let me assign a variable to the unknown number. Let's say the number is x.\n\nSo, the first part says 10 is subtracted from two-thirds of the number. So mathematically, that would be (2/3)x minus 10. Right? So that's (2/3)x - 10.\n\nThe second part says the result is equal to the sum of 40 and one-third of the number. So that would be 40 plus (1/3)x. So, 40 + (1/3)x.\n\nPutting it all together, the equation is: (2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x.\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. Let me write that equation down clearly:\n\n(2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x.\n\nHmm, okay, let's try to get all the x terms on one side and the constants on the other. Maybe subtract (1/3)x from both sides to get rid of it on the right.\n\nSo subtract (1/3)x from both sides:\n\n(2/3)x - (1/3)x - 10 = 40.\n\nSimplify the left side. 2/3 minus 1/3 is 1/3, so that becomes (1/3)x - 10 = 40.\n\nNow, I want to get rid of the -10 on the left. I'll add 10 to both sides:\n\n(1/3)x = 40 + 10.\n\nWhich is (1/3)x = 50.\n\nTo solve for x, I need to multiply both sides by 3. So:\n\nx = 50 * 3.\n\nWhich is x = 150.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Let me plug x = 150 back into the original equation to make sure both sides are equal.\n\nLeft side: (2/3)*150 - 10. Let's compute that. 2/3 of 150 is 100, because 150 divided by 3 is 50, times 2 is 100. Then subtract 10: 100 -10 = 90.\n\nRight side: 40 + (1/3)*150. 1/3 of 150 is 50, so 40 +50 is 90.\n\nYes, both sides equal 90. So x=150 is correct.\n\nLooking at the options, C is 150.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says: If 10 is subtracted from two-thirds of a number, the result is equal to the sum of 40 and one-third of the number. I need to find the number. The options are A) 100, B) 160, C) 150, D) 210, E) 220.\n\nHmm, okay. Let's break this down. Let me assign a variable to the unknown number. Let's say the number is x.\n\nSo, the first part says 10 is subtracted from two-thirds of the number. So mathematically, that would be (2/3)x minus 10. Right? So that's (2/3)x - 10.\n\nThe second part says the result is equal to the sum of 40 and one-third of the number. So that would be 40 plus (1/3)x. So, 40 + (1/3)x.\n\nPutting it all together, the equation is: (2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x.\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. Let me write that equation down clearly:\n\n(2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x.\n\nHmm, okay, let's try to get all the x terms on one side and the constants on the other. Maybe subtract (1/3)x from both sides to get rid of it on the right.\n\nSo subtract (1/3)x from both sides:\n\n(2/3)x - (1/3)x - 10 = 40.\n\nSimplify the left side. 2/3 minus 1/3 is 1/3, so that becomes (1/3)x - 10 = 40.\n\nNow, I want to get rid of the -10 on the left. I'll add 10 to both sides:\n\n(1/3)x = 40 + 10.\n\nWhich is (1/3)x = 50.\n\nTo solve for x, I need to multiply both sides by 3. So:\n\nx = 50 * 3.\n\nWhich is x = 150.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Let me plug x = 150 back into the original equation to make sure both sides are equal.\n\nLeft side: (2/3)*150 - 10. Let's compute that. 2/3 of 150 is 100, because 150 divided by 3 is 50, times 2 is 100. Then subtract 10: 100 -10 = 90.\n\nRight side: 40 + (1/3)*150. 1/3 of 150 is 50, so 40 +50 is 90.\n\nYes, both sides equal 90. So x=150 is correct.\n\nLooking at the options, C is 150. So the correct answer is C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let the unknown number be \\( x \\). The equation based on the problem statement is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3}x - 10 = 40 + \\frac{1}{3}x\n\\]\n\nFirst, subtract \\( \\frac{1}{3}x \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3}x - \\frac{1}{3}x - 10 = 40\n\\]\n\nSimplify \\( \\frac{2}{3}x - \\frac{1}{3}x \\) to \\( \\frac{1}{3}x \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3}x - 10 = 40\n\\]\n\nNext, add 10 to both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3}x = 50\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 3 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = 150\n\\]\n\nTo verify, substitute \\( x = 150 \\) back into the original equation:\n\n- Left side: \\( \\frac{2}{3}(150) - 10 = 100 - 10 = 90 \\)\n- Right side: \\( 40 + \\frac{1}{3}(150) = 40 + 50 = 90 \\)\n\nBoth sides are equal, confirming \\( x = 150 \\) is correct.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: If 10 is subtracted from two-thirds of a number, the result is equal to the sum of 40 and one-third of the number. I need to find the number. The options are A) 100, B) 160, C) 150, D) 210, E) 220.\n\nHmm, alright. Let me break this down. Let's call the number 'x' because that's the usual variable we use. So, two-thirds of the number would be (2/3)x. Then, 10 is subtracted from that. So, that part is (2/3)x - 10.\n\nOn the other side of the equation, the result is equal to the sum of 40 and one-third of the number. So that would be 40 + (1/3)x.\n\nSo putting it all together, the equation is:\n(2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x.\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. Let me think about how to do that. First, maybe I should get all the terms with x on one side and the constants on the other. So, subtract (1/3)x from both sides. That would give me (2/3)x - (1/3)x - 10 = 40.\n\nWait, let me calculate (2/3)x - (1/3)x. Since both are fractions with the same denominator, I can subtract the numerators. 2-1 is 1, so that's (1/3)x. So now the equation is (1/3)x - 10 = 40.\n\nNext, I should get rid of that -10 on the left. I'll add 10 to both sides. So, (1/3)x = 50.\n\nNow, to find x, I need to get rid of the fraction. Multiply both sides by 3. So, x = 50 * 3 = 150.\n\nWait, but let me check the options. Option C is 150, so that's one of the choices. But wait, did I do that correctly?\n\nLet me double-check the steps. Original equation:\n\n(2/3)x -10 = 40 + (1/3)x.\n\nSubtract (1/3)x from both sides:\n\n(2/3 -1/3)x -10 =40 \u2192 (1/3)x -10 =40.\n\nAdd 10 to both sides: (1/3)x=50.\n\nMultiply by 3: x=150.\n\nYes, that seems right. Alternatively, I could plug in the options to see which one works.\n\nLet's test option C, which is 150.\n\nLeft side: (2/3)*150 -10 \u2192 100 -10 =90.\n\nRight side:40 + (1/3)*150 \u219240 +50=90.\n\nYes, both sides equal 90, so that works. So the answer should be C)150.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding a number \\( x \\) such that when 10 is subtracted from two-thirds of \\( x \\), the result equals the sum of 40 and one-third of \\( x \\). Let's break down the solution:\n\n1. Translate the problem into an equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{3}x - 10 = 40 + \\frac{1}{3}x\n   \\]\n\n2. Subtract \\(\\frac{1}{3}x\\) from both sides to combine \\( x \\)-terms:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{3}x - \\frac{1}{3}x - 10 = 40\n   \\]\n   Simplify:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3}x - 10 = 40\n   \\]\n\n3. Add 10 to both sides to isolate the \\( x \\)-term:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3}x = 50\n   \\]\n\n4. Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = 50 \\times 3 = 150\n   \\]\n\nTo verify, substitute \\( x = 150 \\) back into the original equation:\n- Left side: \\(\\frac{2}{3}(150) - 10 = 100 - 10 = 90\\)\n- Right side: \\(40 + \\frac{1}{3}(150) = 40 + 50 = 90\\)\n\nBoth sides are equal, confirming that \\( x = 150 \\) is correct.\n\nAnswer: C",

I need to find that number, and the options are A) 100, B) 160, C) 150, D) 210, E) 220.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. So, I'm going to let the unknown number be x. The problem involves fractions and subtraction, so I'll need to set up an equation based on the description.\n\nFirst part: 10 is subtracted from two-thirds of the number. So, that would be (2/3)x minus 10. Right? Because two-thirds of x is (2/3)x, and then subtract 10 from that.\n\nSecond part: the result is equal to the sum of 40 and one-third of the number. So, that's 40 plus (1/3)x. So, the equation should be (2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x.\n\nWait, let me make sure I got that right. The way the problem is phrased, yes: 10 is subtracted from two-thirds, which is (2/3)x minus 10. And that equals 40 plus one-third x.\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. Let me write the equation again:\n\n(2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x.\n\nI think the best way to solve this is to get all the x terms on one side and the constants on the other. So, maybe subtract (1/3)x from both sides to start.\n\nSubtracting (1/3)x from both sides gives:\n\n(2/3)x - (1/3)x -10 = 40.\n\nWait, because (2/3)x minus (1/3)x is (1/3)x.

Then subtract 10: 100-10=90.\n\nSecond part: 40 plus 1/3 of 150. 1/3 of 150 is 50, plus 40 is 90. Yep, both sides are 90. So that works.\n\nWait, but why is there another option, like 160? Let me make sure I didn't miscalculate.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me re-examine the setup. Maybe I misread the problem.\n\nThe problem says: If 10 is subtracted from two-thirds of a number, the result equals the sum of 40 and one-third of the number.\n\nWait, so the equation is (2/3)x -10 = 40 + (1/3)x.\n\nWait, but when I subtract (1/3)x, I get (2/3 - 1/3)x = (1/3)x.
