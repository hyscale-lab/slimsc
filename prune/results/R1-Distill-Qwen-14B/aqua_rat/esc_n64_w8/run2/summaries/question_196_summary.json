      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about electric poles and trees casting shadows. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking for the height of a tree that casts a shadow of 15 meters, given that an electric pole 14 meters high casts a shadow of 10 meters under similar conditions. \n\nWait, similar conditions probably mean the same angle of the sun, right? Because if the sun's angle is the same, the triangles formed by the objects and their shadows should be similar. Oh right, similar triangles! So I think I can set up a proportion here.\n\nSo, the electric pole is 14m high with a shadow of 10m. The tree is what we're trying to find, let's call its height 'h' meters, and it has a shadow of 15m. Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of their corresponding sides should be equal.\n\nSo the ratio of the pole's height to its shadow should be the same as the tree's height to its shadow. That would be 14/10 = h/15. Or wait, maybe I should write it as 14/10 = h/15? Because the height corresponds to the height, and shadow to shadow.\n\nLet me make sure. So the pole's height over its shadow length equals the tree's height over its shadow length. So 14/10 = h/15. Yeah, that makes sense. Because when two triangles are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal.\n\nNow, solving for h. So cross-multiplying, 14 * 15 = 10 * h. Let's compute that. 14 times 15 is... 14*10 is 140, 14*5 is 70, so total 210. So 210 equals 10h. Then h is 210 divided by 10, which is 21. So h is 21 meters. \n\nLooking at the options, option A is 21. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I mix up the ratios? Because sometimes I get confused whether it's height over shadow or shadow over height. Let me think again. If the sun's rays are the same angle, the ratio of height to shadow length should be the same. So pole's height is 14, shadow is 10. So 14/10 = tree height / 15. Yeah, that's correct. So 14/10 simplifies to 7/5. So 7/5 = h/15. Multiply both sides by 15: h = (7/5)*15 = 7*3=21. Yep, same result. So I think I'm confident with 21 meters.\n",

Hmm, I remember from school that this might have something to do with similar triangles or proportions. Let me think.\n\nAlright, the electric pole is 14 meters high and casts a shadow of 10 meters. I guess that means the height of the pole and the length of the shadow are in a certain ratio. So maybe the tree's shadow length will help me find its height using the same ratio.\n\nWait, similar conditions probably mean the sun's angle is the same for both, right? So the triangles formed by the pole and its shadow and the tree and its shadow should be similar.

Oh, so the height is 7/5 times the shadow length. Or wait, maybe the other way around? Let me make sure.\n\nWait, no. Because the height is the vertical side and the shadow is the horizontal. So if the pole is taller, the shadow is longer, but in this case, the pole is 14 and the shadow is 10. So the ratio is 14/10 for height to shadow. So the tree's shadow is 15 meters. So I should set up a proportion.\n\nLet me write it down. For the electric pole: height_pole / shadow_pole = height_tree / shadow_tree. So 14/10 = h_tree/15.

Cross multiply: 10h =14*15 \u2192 10h=210 \u2192 h=21. Same answer. Oh, okay, so either way, same result.\n\nSo yeah, the answer should be 21, which is option A.\n",

Hmm, I remember from school that when two objects cast shadows under similar conditions, the lengths of the shadows and their heights are proportional. Oh right, it's similar triangles or something like that. So the idea is that the ratio of the height of the object to the length of its shadow remains the same for both the pole and the tree.\n\nLet me read the problem again. The electric pole is 14 meters high and casts a shadow of 10 meters. The tree casts a shadow of 15 meters, and I need to find its height. So, I think I can set up a proportion here.\n\nSo, the ratio for the electric pole is height divided by shadow length. That would be 14 divided by 10. Let me write that as 14/10. Now, for the tree, the shadow is 15 meters, and I'm looking for the height, which I'll call h. So the ratio for the tree is h/15.\n\nSince the conditions are similar, these two ratios should be equal. So, I can set up the equation 14/10 = h/15. Now, I need to solve for h. To do that, I can cross-multiply. So, 14 * 15 should equal 10 * h.\n\nLet me calculate 14 times 15. Hmm, 14 * 10 is 140, and 14 * 5 is 70, so 140 +70 = 210. So 210 equals 10h.

So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Did I mix up the ratios? The pole is taller than the shadow, so the tree's shadow is longer than the pole's. So the tree must be taller than the pole because the shadow is longer. Wait, wait, no. Wait a second. Wait, the shadow is longer, but does that mean the tree is taller? Wait, if the pole is 14m and shadow 10m, and the tree's shadow is 15m, which is longer. So, the tree is taller because the shadow is longer when the sun's angle is the same.\n\nWait, let me think again. The ratio of height to shadow length is the same. So if the pole's ratio is 14/10, and the tree's is h/15. So if the shadow is longer, the height must be proportionally taller.\n\nWait, but according to my calculation, 14/10 = h/15 leads to h=21. But wait, 21 is taller than 14, which makes sense because the shadow is longer. So yeah, that makes sense. So the answer should be 21, which is option A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about electric poles and trees casting shadows. Hmm, I remember from school that when two objects cast shadows under similar conditions, the lengths of the shadows and their heights are proportional. Oh right, it's similar triangles or something like that. So the idea is that the ratio of the height of the object to the length of its shadow remains the same for both the pole and the tree.\n\nLet me read the problem again. The electric pole is 14 meters high and casts a shadow of 10 meters. The tree casts a shadow of 15 meters, and I need to find its height. So, I think I can set up a proportion here.\n\nSo, the ratio for the electric pole is height divided by shadow length. That would be 14 divided by 10. Let me write that as 14/10. Now, for the tree, the shadow is 15 meters, and I'm looking for the height, which I'll call h. So the ratio for the tree is h/15.\n\nSince the conditions are similar, these two ratios should be equal. So, I can set up the equation 14/10 = h/15. Now, I need to solve for h. To do that, I can cross-multiply. So, 14 * 15 should equal 10 * h.\n\nLet me calculate 14 times 15. Hmm, 14 * 10 is 140, and 14 * 5 is 70, so 140 +70 = 210. So 210 equals 10h. Now, to find h, I divide both sides by 10. That gives h = 210 / 10, which is 21. So the height of the tree is 21 meters.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 21. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Did I mix up the ratios? The pole is taller than the shadow, so the tree's shadow is longer than the pole's. So the tree must be taller than the pole because the shadow is longer. Wait, wait, no. Wait a second. Wait, the shadow is longer, but does that mean the tree is taller? Wait, if the pole is 14m and shadow 10m, and the tree's shadow is 15m, which is longer. So, the tree is taller because the shadow is longer when the sun's angle is the same.\n\nWait, let me think again. The ratio of height to shadow length is the same. So if the pole's ratio is 14/10, and the tree's is h/15. So if the shadow is longer, the height must be proportionally taller.\n\nWait, but according to my calculation, 14/10 = h/15 leads to h=21. But wait, 21 is taller than 14, which makes sense because the shadow is longer. So yeah, that makes sense. So the answer should be 21, which is option A.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the height of a tree that casts a shadow of 15 metres, given that an electric pole of height 14 metres casts a shadow of 10 metres. Since the conditions are similar, the ratio of height to shadow length is constant. \n\nFor the electric pole, the ratio is \\( \\frac{14}{10} \\). For the tree, the ratio is \\( \\frac{h}{15} \\), where \\( h \\) is the height of the tree. Setting these ratios equal gives the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{14}{10} = \\frac{h}{15}\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying yields:\n\n\\[\n14 \\times 15 = 10 \\times h\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\( 14 \\times 15 \\) gives \\( 210 \\), so:\n\n\\[\n210 = 10h\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 10:\n\n\\[\nh = 21\n\\]\n\nThus, the height of the tree is 21 metres. Since the tree's shadow is longer than the pole's, the tree must be taller than the pole, which aligns with the result. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: A**",
