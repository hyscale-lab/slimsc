      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out how much money John has. Let me try to understand what's going on.\n\nSo, Mark and John are talking about exchanging money. Mark tells John, \"If you give me half your money, I'll have Rs.75.\" Then John responds, \"If you give me one third of your money, I'll have Rs.75.\" Hmm, okay, so both of them are making statements about what would happen if they gave each other a certain portion of their money.\n\nI think I should set up some variables to represent the amounts they have. Let me say that Mark has M rupees and John has J rupees. That makes sense. Now, let's break down each of their statements into equations.\n\nFirst, Mark's statement: If John gives Mark half of his money, John will have J/2 left. Then Mark will receive J/2, so Mark's new amount would be M + J/2. According to Mark, this new amount would be Rs.75. So the equation from Mark's statement is:\n\nM + (J/2) = 75. \n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, when John gives half his money to Mark, John's money becomes J - (J/2) = J/2. And Mark's money becomes M + (J/2). And Mark says he'll then have 75. So yes, the equation is correct: M + (J/2) = 75.\n\nNow, John's statement: If Mark gives him one third of his money, then John will have his current amount plus M/3. So John's new amount would be J + (M/3). Mark, on the other hand, would have M - (M/3) = (2M)/3. But John says that after this exchange, he would have 75. So the equation from John's statement is:\n\nJ + (M/3) = 75.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1. M + (J/2) = 75\n2. J + (M/3) = 75\n\nHmm, so I have two equations with two variables. I can solve this system of equations.\n\nLet me write them again:\n\nEquation 1: M + (J/2) = 75\nEquation 2: J + (M/3) = 75\n\nI can solve this using substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination would be easier here.\n\nLet me rearrange both equations to express M and J in terms that can be subtracted or added.\n\nEquation 1: Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction.\n\n2M + J = 150.\n\nEquation 2: Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction.\n\n3J + M = 225.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me check that. Equation 2 is J + (M/3) =75. Multiply both sides by 3: 3J + M = 225. Yes.\n\nSo now the two equations are:\n\n2M + J = 150  -- Equation 1a\nM + 3J = 225  -- Equation 2a\n\nNow, perhaps I can solve this using elimination. Let me try to eliminate one variable. Let's say I eliminate J. From equation 1a, J = 150 - 2M. I can substitute this into equation 2a.\n\nSo substituting J into equation 2a:\n\nM + 3*(150 - 2M) = 225\n\nLet's compute that:\n\nM + 450 -6M = 225\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(1M -6M) +450 =225 \u2192 (-5M) +450 =225\n\nSubtract 450 from both sides:\n\n-5M = 225 -450 \u2192 -5M = -225\n\nDivide both sides by -5:\n\nM = (-225)/(-5) \u2192 M =45.\n\nSo Mark has 45 rupees.\n\nNow, substitute M=45 back into equation 1a to find J.\n\nEquation 1a: 2M + J =150 \u2192 2*45 + J =150 \u219290 + J=150 \u2192 J=60.\n\nWait, so John has 60 rupees? Let me check that with both original statements.\n\nFirst, check Mark's statement: If John gives half his money (which is 30) to Mark. Then John has 30, Mark has 45 +30=75. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow check John's statement: If Mark gives John one third of his money. Mark has 45, so one third is 15. So Mark gives 15 to John. John had 60, so now has 75. That's correct as well.\n\nSo the answer must be 60, which is option B.\n",

Let's denote the variables. Let's say Mark has M rupees and John has J rupees.\n\nFirst scenario: John gives half his money to Mark. So John gives away J/2. Now, after giving, John will have J - J/2 = J/2 left. And Mark will have M + J/2. According to Mark, this amount will be 75 rupees. So equation one is M + (J/2) = 75.\n\nSecond scenario: Now, John says, if Mark gives him one third of his money, John will have 75. Wait, wait, no. Let me read that again. Oh, wait, the problem says, \"if you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75.\" So in this case, it's Mark giving one third of his money to John. So Mark gives M/3 to John. So after that, Mark will have M - (M/3) = (2M/3). And John will have J + (M/3). According to John, this will be 75. So equation two is J + (M/3) =75.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1. M + (J/2) =75\n2. J + (M/3)=75\n\nI need to solve these two equations to find J, which is John's initial amount.\n\nLet me write the equations again:\n\nEquation 1: M + (J/2) =75\nEquation 2: J + (M/3) =75\n\nI think substitution would be the way to go here. Let's solve equation 1 for M.\n\nFrom equation 1:\nM =75 - (J/2)\n\nNow plug this into equation 2.\n\nEquation 2 becomes: J + [ (75 - (J/2)) / 3 ] =75\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, compute (75 - (J/2)) /3.

But wait, looking at the options, 60 is option B. But I should double-check because sometimes these problems can be tricky.\n\nWait, let's make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the algebra.\n\nSo from equation 1, M =75 - (J/2)\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\nJ + (M/3) =75 \u2192 J + (75 - J/2)/3 =75\n\nExpanding:\n\nJ + [75/3 - (J/2)/3 ] =75 \u2192 J +25 - J/(6) =75\n\nCombine J terms: J - J/6 = (6J -J)/6 =5J/6\n\nSo 5J/6 +25 =75 \u2192 5J/6 =50 \u2192 5J=300 \u2192 J=60.\n\nYes, that's correct. So John has 60 rupees.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check the options again. The options are A)22, B)60, C)28, D)26, E)18.\n\nSo the answer should be B)60. But let me verify with the original problem.\n\nLet me plug J=60 into equation 1: M + 60/2 =75 \u2192 M +30=75 \u2192 M=45.\n\nSo Mark has 45, John has 60.\n\nNow, check the first condition: John gives half his money to Mark. So John gives 30 to Mark. Now Mark has 45+30=75, which matches.\n\nNow check John's condition: Mark gives one third of his money to John. Mark's money is 45, so one third is 15. So Mark gives 15 to John. Now John has 60+15=75, which also matches.\n\nSo both conditions are satisfied. Therefore, John has 60 rupees.\n\nWait, but wait another thing.

So in this scenario, Mark gives J' = (1/3)M to John. So after that, Mark has M - (1/3)M = (2/3)M, and John has J + (1/3)M. And John's amount here is 75, so J + (1/3)M = 75. That's equation two.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1. M + (J/2) = 75\n2. J + (M/3) = 75\n\nI need to solve these two equations to find J, which is John's money.\n\nLet me write them again:\n\nEquation 1: M + (J/2) = 75\nEquation 2: J + (M/3) = 75\n\nHmm, I can solve these using substitution or elimination. Let's try elimination.\n\nLet me rearrange equation 1 to express M in terms of J.\n\nFrom equation 1: M = 75 - (J/2)\n\nNow, substitute M into equation 2.\n\nEquation 2 becomes: J + [(75 - J/2)/3] =75.\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, substitute M:\n\nJ + (1/3)(75 - (J/2)) =75.\n\nLet me expand the terms:\n\nJ + (75/3) - (J/(2*3)) =75.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n75/3 is 25.\n\nJ - (J/6) +25 =75.\n\nCombine like terms. J is the same as 6J/6, so:\n\n6J/6 - J/6 =5J/6.\n\nSo, 5J/6 +25 =75.\n\nSubtract 25 from both sides:\n\n5J/6 =50.\n\nMultiply both sides by 6:\n\n5J =300.\n\nDivide by5:\n\nJ=60.\n\nWait, so John has 60 rupees. Let me check the options. Option B is 60. So that's the answer? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, let's verify both conditions with J=60 and M= ?\n\nFrom equation 1: M + (60/2) =75 \u2192 M +30=75 \u2192 M=45.\n\nSo Mark has 45, John has 60.\n\nFirst scenario: John gives half (30) to Mark. So Mark gets 30, so Mark has 75 (45+30=75), which matches. John is left with 30, which is correct.\n\nSecond scenario: Mark gives a third of his money (45/3=15) to John. So Mark's new amount is 45-15=30, and John's new amount is 60+15=75. That also matches.\n\nSo yeah, both conditions are satisfied. So John has 60 rupees. So the correct option is B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Mark and John are talking about exchanging money, and based on their statements, I need to find out how much money John has. Hmm, sounds like an algebra problem.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. The first part says Mark told John, \"If you give me half your money, I will have Rs.75.\" So Mark is saying, if John gives him half of his current money, then Mark's total will be 75 rupees. Wait, no, wait. Wait, Mark is saying that if John gives him half of his money, Mark will have 75. So Mark is taking half of John's money and adding it to his own. So, I think I need to model this.\n\nLet me assign variables. Let's say Mark has M rupees and John has J rupees. So, initially, Mark has M, John has J.\n\nFirst scenario: John gives half his money to Mark. So John gives J/2 to Mark. So after that, Mark will have M + J/2, and John will have J - J/2 = J/2. And according to Mark's statement, Mark's amount becomes 75. So M + J/2 = 75. That's equation one.\n\nThen, John says, \"If you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75.\" So John is telling Mark that if Mark gives him a third of Mark's money, then John will have 75. So in this scenario, Mark gives J' = (1/3)M to John. So after that, Mark has M - (1/3)M = (2/3)M, and John has J + (1/3)M. And John's amount here is 75, so J + (1/3)M = 75. That's equation two.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1. M + (J/2) = 75\n2. J + (M/3) = 75\n\nI need to solve these two equations to find J, which is John's money.\n\nLet me write them again:\n\nEquation 1: M + (J/2) = 75\nEquation 2: J + (M/3) = 75\n\nHmm, I can solve these using substitution or elimination. Let's try elimination.\n\nLet me rearrange equation 1 to express M in terms of J.\n\nFrom equation 1: M = 75 - (J/2)\n\nNow, substitute M into equation 2.\n\nEquation 2 becomes: J + [(75 - J/2)/3] =75.\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, substitute M:\n\nJ + (1/3)(75 - (J/2)) =75.\n\nLet me expand the terms:\n\nJ + (75/3) - (J/(2*3)) =75.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n75/3 is 25.\n\nJ - (J/6) +25 =75.\n\nCombine like terms. J is the same as 6J/6, so:\n\n6J/6 - J/6 =5J/6.\n\nSo, 5J/6 +25 =75.\n\nSubtract 25 from both sides:\n\n5J/6 =50.\n\nMultiply both sides by 6:\n\n5J =300.\n\nDivide by5:\n\nJ=60.\n\nWait, so John has 60 rupees. Let me check the options. Option B is 60. So that's the answer? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, let's verify both conditions with J=60 and M= ?\n\nFrom equation 1: M + (60/2) =75 \u2192 M +30=75 \u2192 M=45.\n\nSo Mark has 45, John has 60.\n\nFirst scenario: John gives half (30) to Mark. So Mark gets 30, so Mark has 75 (45+30=75), which matches. John is left with 30, which is correct.\n\nSecond scenario: Mark gives a third of his money (45/3=15) to John. So Mark's new amount is 45-15=30, and John's new amount is 60+15=75. That also matches.\n\nSo yeah, both conditions are satisfied. So John has 60 rupees. So the correct option is B.\n\n\nLet \\( M \\) be the amount of money Mark has, and \\( J \\) be the amount John has. Based on the problem, we can set up the following equations:\n\n1. From Mark's statement: If John gives half his money to Mark, Mark will have Rs. 75. This gives the equation:\n   \\[\n   M + \\frac{J}{2} = 75\n   \\]\n\n2. From John's statement: If Mark gives one-third of his money to John, John will have Rs. 75. This gives the equation:\n   \\[\n   J + \\frac{M}{3} = 75\n   \\]\n\nTo solve these equations, we first express \\( M \\) from the first equation:\n\\[\nM = 75 - \\frac{J}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute this expression for \\( M \\) into the second equation:\n\\[\nJ + \\frac{1}{3}\\left(75 - \\frac{J}{2}\\right) = 75\n\\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\\[\nJ + 25 - \\frac{J}{6} = 75\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\\[\n\\frac{5J}{6} + 25 = 75\n\\]\n\nSubtract 25 from both sides:\n\\[\n\\frac{5J}{6} = 50\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 6:\n\\[\n5J = 300\n\\]\n\nDivide by 5:\n\\[\nJ = 60\n\\]\n\nThus, John has Rs. 60. Verifying with \\( M = 45 \\) (from \\( M = 75 - \\frac{J}{2} \\)), both conditions of the problem are satisfied.\n\nAnswer: B",

The options are A)22, B)60, C)28, D)26, E)18.\n\nHmm, so it's a two-part problem where each person makes a statement about what would happen if the other gives them some portion of their money. I think I need to set up equations based on these statements and solve for the variables.\n\nLet me denote the variables. Let's say J is the amount of money John has, and M is the amount Mark has. \n\nFirst, Mark's statement: If John gives him half his money, Mark will have Rs.75. So, if John gives half, John's remaining money would be J/2. Mark would receive that same amount, so Mark's new amount would be M + J/2. According to Mark, this would equal 75. So equation one is:\n\nM + (J/2) = 75   ...(1)\n\nNow, John's statement: If Mark gives him one third of Mark's money, John will have Rs.75. So, Mark gives away (1/3)M, which he would give to John. So, Mark's remaining money would be M - (M/3) = (2M/3). John would receive M/3, so his new amount would be J + (M/3) = 75. So equation two is:\n\nJ + (M/3) = 75   ...(2)\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1. M + J/2 =75\n2.

Let me combine J and -J/6.\n\nJ is the same as (6J/6), so 6J/6 - J/6 = (5J)/6.\n\nSo, (5J/6) +25 =75\n\nSubtract 25 from both sides:\n\n5J/6 = 75 -25 =50\n\nMultiply both sides by 6:\n\n5J = 300\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\nJ=60.\n\nWait, so J is 60.

If John gives half his money, which is 30, to Mark. So Mark would have 45+30=75. That checks out.\n\nJohn's statement: If Mark gives John a third of his money. Mark has 45, so a third is 15. So John would have 60+15=75. That also checks out.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is 60. So the answer should be B.\n\nBut wait, the options given are A)22, B)60, C)28, D)26, E)18.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where Mark and John are talking about exchanging money, and I need to figure out how much money John has. Let me read the problem again carefully to understand what's going on.\n\nThe problem says: Mark told John, \"If you give me half your money, I will have Rs.75.\" Then John responds, \"If you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75.\" The question is, how much money does John have? The options are A)22, B)60, C)28, D)26, E)18.\n\nHmm, so it's a two-part problem where each person makes a statement about what would happen if the other gives them some portion of their money. I think I need to set up equations based on these statements and solve for the variables.\n\nLet me denote the variables. Let's say J is the amount of money John has, and M is the amount Mark has. \n\nFirst, Mark's statement: If John gives him half his money, Mark will have Rs.75. So, if John gives half, John's remaining money would be J/2. Mark would receive that same amount, so Mark's new amount would be M + J/2. According to Mark, this would equal 75. So equation one is:\n\nM + (J/2) = 75   ...(1)\n\nNow, John's statement: If Mark gives him one third of Mark's money, John will have Rs.75. So, Mark gives away (1/3)M, which he would give to John. So, Mark's remaining money would be M - (M/3) = (2M/3). John would receive M/3, so his new amount would be J + (M/3) = 75. So equation two is:\n\nJ + (M/3) = 75   ...(2)\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1. M + J/2 =75\n2. J + M/3 =75\n\nI need to solve these two equations to find J.\n\nLet me write them again:\n\nEquation 1: M + (J/2) =75\nEquation 2: J + (M/3) =75\n\nI can solve these equations using substitution or elimination. Let me try substitution.\n\nFrom equation 1, I can express M in terms of J.\n\nM = 75 - (J/2)   ...(3)\n\nNow, substitute this M into equation 2.\n\nEquation 2 becomes: J + [ (75 - (J/2)) / 3 ] =75\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, expand the equation:\n\nJ + [ (75 - (J/2) ) / 3 ] =75\n\nLet me compute the fraction part: (75 - J/2) divided by 3.\n\nWhich is (75/3) - (J/2)/3 = 25 - (J/(6))\n\nSo the equation now is:\n\nJ + 25 - (J/6) =75\n\nCombine like terms. Let me combine J and -J/6.\n\nJ is the same as (6J/6), so 6J/6 - J/6 = (5J)/6.\n\nSo, (5J/6) +25 =75\n\nSubtract 25 from both sides:\n\n5J/6 = 75 -25 =50\n\nMultiply both sides by 6:\n\n5J = 300\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\nJ=60.\n\nWait, so J is 60. Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nSo John has 60 rupees. Let's see what Mark has. From equation (3):\n\nM=75 - (60/2)=75-30=45.\n\nSo Mark has 45, John has 60.\n\nNow, let's test Mark's statement. If John gives half his money, which is 30, to Mark. So Mark would have 45+30=75. That checks out.\n\nJohn's statement: If Mark gives John a third of his money. Mark has 45, so a third is 15. So John would have 60+15=75. That also checks out.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is 60. So the answer should be B.\n\nBut wait, the options given are A)22, B)60, C)28, D)26, E)18. So B is 60, which is what we got. So that's correct.\n\n\nLet \\( J \\) represent the amount of money John has, and \\( M \\) represent the amount Mark has. Based on the problem, two equations can be derived:\n\n1. From Mark's statement: If John gives half his money to Mark, Mark will have Rs. 75.  \n   \\[\n   M + \\frac{J}{2} = 75 \\tag{1}\n   \\]\n\n2. From John's statement: If Mark gives one-third of his money to John, John will have Rs. 75.  \n   \\[\n   J + \\frac{M}{3} = 75 \\tag{2}\n   \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( J \\), express \\( M \\) from equation (1):  \n\\[\nM = 75 - \\frac{J}{2} \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( M \\) from equation (3) into equation (2):  \n\\[\nJ + \\frac{75 - \\frac{J}{2}}{3} = 75\n\\]\n\nSimplify the fraction:  \n\\[\nJ + \\left(25 - \\frac{J}{6}\\right) = 75\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:  \n\\[\nJ - \\frac{J}{6} + 25 = 75\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5J}{6} + 25 = 75\n\\]\n\nSubtract 25 from both sides:  \n\\[\n\\frac{5J}{6} = 50\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 6:  \n\\[\n5J = 300\n\\]\n\nDivide by 5:  \n\\[\nJ = 60\n\\]\n\nThus, John has Rs. 60. Verifying with the given options, the correct answer is **B) 60**.\n\nAnswer: B",

Then John responds, saying, \"If you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75.\" So, if Mark gives John a third of his money, John's total becomes 75. The question is, how much money does John have?\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I think the best way is to set up some variables. Let me denote John's money as J and Mark's money as M.\n\nFirst scenario: John gives half his money to Mark. So John gives J/2 to Mark. After this transaction:\n\n- Mark's new amount is M + J/2.\n- John's new amount is J - J/2 = J/2.\n\nAnd according to Mark, after this, he (Mark) will have 75. So:\n\nM + (J/2) = 75.  [Equation 1]\n\nSecond scenario: Mark gives John a third of his money. So Mark gives M/3 to John. After this:\n\n- Mark's new amount is M - M/3 = (2M/3).\n- John's new amount is J + M/3.\n\nAccording to John, this will make his total 75. So:\n\nJ + (M/3) = 75.  [Equation 2]\n\nNow I have two equations:\n\n1) M + (J/2) = 75\n2) J + (M/3) = 75\n\nI need to solve these two equations for J and M. Let me see. Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other from one equation and substitute into the other.\n\nLet me take Equation 1: M + (J/2) = 75. So, M = 75 - (J/2). \n\nNow substitute this expression for M into Equation 2.\n\nEquation 2 becomes: J + ( (75 - J/2) ) /3 = 75.\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, expand the substitution:\n\nJ + [ (75 - J/2 ) / 3 ] = 75.\n\nLet me simplify the fraction. Let's compute (75 - J/2)/3.\n\nThat's equal to 75/3 - (J/2)/3 = 25 - (J/6).\n\nSo now, Equation 2 becomes:\n\nJ + 25 - (J/6) = 75.\n\nCombine like terms. J - (J/6) is (5J/6).\n\nSo, (5J/6) + 25 =75.\n\nSubtract 25 from both sides: 5J/6 = 50.\n\nMultiply both sides by 6: 5J = 300.\n\nDivide by 5: J = 60.\n\nWait, so John has 60 rupees? Let me check if this makes sense.\n\nLet me plug J=60 back into Equation 1 to find M.\n\nEquation 1: M + (60/2) = 75 \u2192 M +30 =75 \u2192 M=45.\n\nSo Mark has 45 rupees.\n\nNow let's test the second scenario. If Mark gives John a third of his money. Mark has 45, so a third is 15. So John gets 15, adding to his 60, making 75. That's correct.\n\nLet me check the first scenario again. If John gives half his 60, which is 30, to Mark. Mark had 45, so now he has 75. Yep, that works.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is 60. So that must be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my equations because sometimes I might have made a mistake in setting them up.\n\nWait, in the first scenario, Mark says if John gives him half his money, Mark will have 75. So the money flows from John to Mark. So after that, John has J/2, Mark has M + J/2. So equation 1 is correct.\n\nIn the second scenario, John says if Mark gives him one third of his money, John will have 75. So money flows from Mark to John. So Mark's new amount is M - M/3 = 2M/3, and John's new amount is J + M/3. So equation 2 is correct.\n\nSo substituting, I get J=60, which is an option. So the answer should be option B)60.\n",
