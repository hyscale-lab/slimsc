      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about Sachin's batting average in the IPL season. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on averages, but let me think this through. \n\nThe question says that Sachin's current batting average is 51. Then in the finals, he scores 78 runs, and his average goes up to 54. We need to find out how many matches he's played this season.\n\nWait, batting average is calculated by total runs divided by the number of matches, right? So average = total runs / number of matches.\n\nLet me denote the number of matches he played before the finals as 'n'. So, before the finals, his total runs would be 51 multiplied by n, because average is 51. \n\nThen, in the finals, he scores 78 runs. So his new total runs would be 51n +78. And the number of matches becomes n+1. \n\nNow, his new average is 54. So the equation would be:\n\n(51n +78)/(n+1) =54.\n\nI can solve this equation for n. Let's write that out.\n\n51n +78 =54*(n+1)\n\nExpanding the right side: 54n +54.\n\nSo, 51n +78 =54n +54.\n\nLet me get all the n terms on one side and constants on the other. Subtract 51n from both sides:\n\n78 = 3n +54.\n\nWait, wait, 54n -51n is 3n. So 78 -54 is 24, right? Because 54 is on the right side now. Wait, no, wait:\n\nWait, after subtracting 51n from both sides, I get 78 = 3n +54. Because 54n -51n is 3n, and 54 remains.\n\nSo subtract 54 from both sides: 78-54 =3n. 24=3n.\n\nSo n=24/3=8. So n is 8.\n\nWait, n is the number of matches before the finals. So total matches now is n+1=8+1=9.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 9. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nStarting equation: (51n +78)/(n+1)=54.\n\nMultiply both sides by (n+1): 51n +78 =54n +54.\n\nSubtract 51n: 78=3n +54.\n\nSubtract 54:24=3n.\n\nn=8. So total matches is 8+1=9. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAnother way: Let's plug in n=8 into the original average.\n\nBefore finals: 8 matches, 51*8=408 runs.\n\nAfter finals: 9 matches, 408+78=486 runs. 486/9=54. Which matches the given average. So yes, correct.\n",

Oh, but wait, in cricket, sometimes a match can be a no-ball or a duck, but I think here it's simpler. So, batting average is total runs divided by the number of innings he has batted in.\n\nLet me think. Let's denote the number of matches he has played before the finals as 'n'.

I remember batting average is calculated by dividing the total runs scored by the number of innings you've batted, right? So, the average is total runs divided by number of matches, I guess.\n\nThe problem says that Sachin's current batting average is 51. Then, in the finals, he scores 78 runs, and his average goes up to 54. I need to find out how many matches he's played in total this season.\n\nWait, let me think about the variables involved. Let's denote the number of matches he played before the finals as 'n'. So, his total runs before the finals would be 51 multiplied by n, because average is total runs divided by number of matches. So total runs = 51n.\n\nThen, in the finals, he plays one more match and scores 78 runs. So, the new total runs become 51n +78. And the number of matches is now n+1. The new average is 54, so:\n\n(51n + 78)/(n + 1) = 54.\n\nNow, I can solve this equation for n.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Sachin's batting average in the IPL season. Hmm, I need to find out how many matches he played in total. Let me try to break this down.\n\nAlright, the question says that his current batting average is 51. Then, in the finals, he scores 78 runs, and his average goes up to 54. I'm a bit rusty on averages, but I remember that batting average is calculated by dividing total runs by the number of innings, right? So, maybe I can set up some equations here.\n\nLet me denote the number of matches he played before the finals as 'n'. Since each match is an innings, his total runs before the finals would be 51 multiplied by n. So, runs before = 51n.\n\nThen, in the finals, he scores 78 runs. So, his total runs after the finals would be 51n + 78. And the number of matches he's played now is n + 1 because he added one more match.\n\nHis new average is 54, so the total runs divided by the number of matches should be 54. That gives me the equation:\n\n(51n + 78) / (n + 1) = 54.\n\nOkay, now I can solve for n. Let me write that equation again:\n\n51n + 78 = 54(n + 1).\n\nExpanding the right side: 54n + 54.\n\nSo, subtract 51n from both sides:\n\n78 = 3n +54.\n\nWait, subtract 54 from both sides:\n\n78 -54 = 3n.\n\n24 = 3n.\n\nSo, n = 8.\n\nWait, that's the number of matches before the finals.

Sometimes I make mistakes when setting up equations.\n\nSo, initial average is 51, so runs =51n.\n\nAfter scoring 78, total runs =51n +78, total matches n+1.\n\nAverage becomes 54, so 51n +78 =54*(n+1).\n\nYes, that's correct. Then expanding:\n\n51n +78 =54n +54.\n\nSubtract 51n and 54 from both sides:\n\n78-54 =54n-51n.\n\n24 =3n \u2192 n=8.\n\nSo total matches 8+1=9. Yep, that seems right. So the answer is C)9.\n\n\nTo determine the total number of matches Sachin played in the IPL season, we start by defining the number of matches he played before the finals as \\( n \\).

Hmm, I remember that batting average is calculated by dividing the total runs scored by the number of innings batted, right? So, the formula would be Batting Average (BA) = Total Runs / Number of Innings.\n\nThe question says that Sachin's current batting average is 51. Then in the finals, he scores 78 runs, and his average goes up to 54. I need to find out how many matches he played in total this season.\n\nWait, but in cricket, each match a player can bat in one innings, right? So if he played 'n' matches, he has batted 'n' times, assuming he batted in each match. So the number of innings is the same as the number of matches he played.\n\nSo let's denote the number of matches as 'm'. His initial average is 51. So before the finals, his total runs would be 51 multiplied by m. Because BA = total runs / innings, so total runs = BA * innings.\n\nThen, in the finals, he scores 78 runs. So his new total runs would be 51m +78. And the number of innings becomes m +1, because he played another match, so another innings.\n\nHis new average is 54. So according to the formula:\n\n54 = (51m +78) / (m +1)\n\nI can set up that equation and solve for m.\n\nSo, let me write that down:\n\n54 = (51m + 78) / (m +1)\n\nMultiply both sides by (m +1) to eliminate the denominator:\n\n54(m +1) = 51m +78\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n54m +54 = 51m +78\n\nNow, subtract 51m from both sides:\n\n3m +54 = 78\n\nSubtract 54 from both sides:\n\n3m = 24\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\nm = 8\n\nSo, m is 8. That means before the finals, he played 8 matches. After the finals, he played 9 matches.\n\nWait, wait. Wait a second. So the total number of matches he played in the season would be m +1, which is 8 +1 =9. Or wait, wait. Wait, the question is asking for the total number of matches played in the season, which would be the number before finals plus one. Because he just played one more in the finals.\n\nWait, but in the setup, the current average is 51, which is before the finals. So he had played 'm' matches, average 51. Then he played one more, making m+1 matches, and his average became 54.\n\nWait, so in the equation, m is the number of matches before the finals. So the total matches are m+1 = 8+1=9.\n\nSo the answer should be 9 matches, which is option C.\n\nLet me double-check the calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSo, m=8.\n\nBefore finals: 8 matches, average 51. So total runs =8*51=408.\n\nAfter finals, he scores 78, so total runs become 408+78=486.\n\nNumber of matches is 9. So 486 divided by 9 is 54, which matches the given average. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the correct answer is C)9.\n",
