      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question is about a positive integer Q that has exactly 5 factors. I'm supposed to determine which of the given statements (I, II, III) must be true about Q. The options are combinations of these statements, so I need to figure out which ones are necessarily correct.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Wait, right, the formula for the number of divisors. If a number is expressed as a product of primes raised to their respective exponents, like Q = p\u2081^a * p\u2082^b * p\u2083^c * ... then the total number of factors is (a+1)*(b+1)*(c+1)*... etc. \n\nSo, since Q has 5 factors, I should think about how 5 can be expressed as a product of integers greater than 1. Because each exponent plus one contributes to the product. \n\nWait, 5 is a prime number, so the only way to write 5 as a product is 5*1. So that means that the exponents in the prime factorization of Q must be such that when each is incremented by one, their product is 5. So, the exponents plus one can only be 5 and 1. \n\nSo, possible scenarios are:\n\n1. There's only one prime factor, and its exponent is 4. Because 4+1=5. So, Q would be p^4, where p is prime.\n\n2. There are two prime factors, but then we'd have (a+1)*(b+1)=5. But 5 is prime, so one of them would have to be 5 and the other 1. That would mean one exponent is 4, the other is 0. But wait, exponents can't be zero in the prime factorization because that would mean the prime isn't present. So that scenario isn't possible unless one of the exponents is 4 and the other is 0. Wait, but if a prime has exponent 0, it's not part of the factorization. So actually, the only possibility is a single prime factor with exponent 4.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me think again. If the number Q has two distinct prime factors, say p and q, then the number of factors would be (a+1)(b+1). So for that product to be 5, which is prime, one of the terms must be 5 and the other 1. So, a+1=5 and b+1=1. That would mean a=4, and b=0. But if b is 0, then q isn't a factor. So that scenario reduces to just a single prime factor again. So the only way to have 5 factors is for Q to be the fourth power of a single prime. \n\nWait, but wait a second. I think I might be making a mistake here. Because I've heard before that numbers with exactly 5 factors are squares of primes. No, wait, wait. Let me get this right. Let me think about the number of factors. \n\nIf Q is p^4, then the number of factors is 4+1=5. So that's correct. So that's one case. Another case: could Q be the product of two primes, each to the first power, like p^1 * q^1. Then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1) = 4, which is less than 5. So that's not the case. \n\nWait, but if Q is p^2, the number of factors is 2+1=3. No. Wait, what about p^4: 5 factors. So that's one way. Alternatively, could Q be p^4 * q^0, which is just p^4. So, the only way to get exactly 5 factors is when Q is the fourth power of a single prime.\n\nWait, but wait, another thought. I've heard that numbers with exactly 5 factors are squares of primes because 5 is a prime number. Wait, that doesn't seem to fit. Let me think again. Because 5 is a prime, the number of factors being 5 implies that the number is of the form p^4. Because 4+1=5, so yes, p^4. So, for example, 16 is 2^4, and its factors are 1,2,4,8,16. So that's five factors. So that's correct.\n\nSo, if Q has exactly five factors, it must be the fourth power of a prime. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Wait, that's p^2. So, for example, 4 is 2^2, factors are 1,2,4. That's three factors. So, if Q were p^2, it would have 3 factors, not 5. So statement I is incorrect. Because statement I says Q is the square of a prime, which would have 3 factors, but Q has 5, so that's not correct. So I is false.\n\nWait, but wait! Wait, I'm getting confused. Because I thought that numbers with exactly three factors are squares of primes. So for example, 4 has 1,2,4. So that's three factors. So 3 factors would be when the number is p^2. But in this case, Q has 5 factors, which is p^4. So I is wrong because it says Q is the square of a prime, which would only give three factors. So I is incorrect.\n\nWait, but then looking at statement II: Q is the fourth power of a prime. Which would be correct, because p^4 gives five factors. So II is correct.\n\nStatement III: Q is the product of two primes. So that would be p*q, where p and q are primes. The number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1) =4. So that's four factors, which is less than five. So III is incorrect.\n\nSo looking back at the statements:\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime. \u2192 No, that's 3 factors.\n\nII. Q is the fourth power of a prime. \u2192 Yes, that's correct.\n\nIII. Q is the product of two primes. \u2192 No, that gives 4 factors.\n\nSo the correct statements are only II. So among the options, which one is that?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) I only \u2192 Incorrect because II is correct.\n\nB) III only \u2192 Incorrect.\n\nC) II only \u2192 Correct, as II is the only correct statement.\n\nD) I and II only \u2192 No, because I is incorrect.\n\nE) I and III only \u2192 No.\n\nSo the answer should be option C.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure I'm not missing any other possible factorizations. Because perhaps Q could have more than one prime factor, but with exponents arranged such that the product of (exponents +1) equals 5. So for example, if Q is p^4 * q^0, that's just p^4. Alternatively, can it be p^1 * q^4? No, because that would give (1+1)(4+1) = 2*5=10 factors, which is more than 5. So no, that's not possible. So the only way is a single prime raised to the fourth power.\n\nSo I think I'm confident that statement II is correct, and the others are not.\n",

The options are I, II, III, and then the choices A to E. Let me think through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Oh right, the formula for the number of divisors (or factors) is to take the exponents in the prime factorization, add one to each, and multiply them all together. For example, if a number N is p^a * q^b, then the number of factors is (a+1)(b+1).\n\nSo in this case, Q has 5 factors. Since 5 is a prime number, the only way to write 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 = 5*1. So that means the formula (a+1)(b+1) must equal 5, which implies that one of the terms is 5 and the others are 1.\n\nSo the exponents plus one would be 5 and 1. Since exponents can't be negative, the exponents themselves must be 4 and 0, because 4+1=5 and 0+1=1. Wait, but 0 exponents would mean that prime isn't actually present in the factorization. So, for a number to have exactly 5 factors, it must be the fourth power of a prime number. Because then the prime factorization would be p^4, so the number of factors is (4+1)=5.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If a number has two distinct prime factors, like p^a * q^b, then the number of factors would be (a+1)(b+1). For this to equal 5, which is prime, one of (a+1) or (b+1) has to be 5 and the other 1. So that would mean either a=4 and b=0, or a=0 and b=4. But b=0 would mean that prime q isn't part of the factorization, so effectively, the number is just p^4. So yes, the number must be the fourth power of a single prime.\n\nSo that would mean that statement II is correct: Q is the fourth power of a prime. Wait, but what about statement I? Statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Hmm, if Q is p^4, then p^4 is (p^2)^2, so it's the square of p squared. But wait, that's a square of a composite number if p is a prime. Oh, wait no, p is a prime, so p squared is a square of a prime, so p^4 is (p^2)^2, which is the square of a square of a prime. So does that make Q a square of a prime? Hmm, no, because the square of a prime is p^2, which has 3 factors. Because (2+1)=3. So if Q is p^4, it's not the square of a prime, it's the fourth power. So statement I would be incorrect.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check again. If Q is p^4, then Q is indeed the fourth power of a prime, which is statement II. So statement II is true. Then statement I says Q is the square of a prime, which would be p^2, which has 3 factors, not 5. So statement I is false.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check. Maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think of an example. Let's take the smallest prime, 2. 2^4 is 16. What are the factors of 16? 1, 2, 4, 8, 16. That's five factors. So 16 is p^4, which is statement II. So statement II is correct.\n\nWhat about statement I? If Q were the square of a prime, say 3^2=9. The factors of 9 are 1,3,9. Only three factors. So statement I is not correct because that would give Q only three factors, not five. So statement I is false.\n\nWhat about statement III? It says Q is the product of two primes. Let's think. If Q is the product of two primes, say p and q, then Q would be p * q. Then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1) = 4, right? So that's four factors. But we need five factors. So statement III can't be correct because that would only give four factors. So statement III is false.\n\nSo putting it all together, only statement II is true. Wait, but let me look at the options again. The options are:\n\nA) I only\nB) III only\nC) II only\nD) I and II only\nE) I and III only\n\nWait, the question is which must be true. So only statement II is true. So the correct answer is option C, II only.\n\nWait a minute, but wait. I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me go through this again.\n\nWait, the number of factors is 5, which is a prime. So the only possible prime factorization is p^4, because 4+1=5. So Q is p^4, which is the fourth power of a prime, so statement II is correct. Statement I says it's the square of a prime, which would be p^2, which has 3 factors.

So statement I is not correct because that would give Q only three factors, not five. So statement I is false.\n\nWhat about statement III? It says Q is the product of two primes. Let's think. If Q is the product of two primes, say p and q, then Q would be p * q. Then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1) = 4, right? So that's four factors. But we need five factors. So statement III can't be correct because that would only give four factors. So statement III is false.\n\nSo putting it all together, only statement II is true. Wait, but let me look at the options again. The options are:\n\nA) I only\nB) III only\nC) II only\nD) I and II only\nE) I and III only\n\nWait, the question is which must be true. So only statement II is true. So the correct answer is option C, II only.\n\nWait a minute, but wait. I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me go through this again.\n\nWait, the number of factors is 5, which is a prime. So the only possible prime factorization is p^4, because 4+1=5. So Q is p^4, which is the fourth power of a prime, so statement II is correct. Statement I says it's the square of a prime, which would be p^2, which has 3 factors. So statement I is incorrect.\n\nSo among the options, only statement II is correct. So the correct answer is C.\n\n\nTo determine which statements about \\( Q \\) are true, we analyze the given condition that \\( Q \\) has exactly 5 factors. The number of factors of a positive integer is determined by its prime factorization. For a number \\( Q \\) with prime factorization \\( p^a \\cdot q^b \\), the number of factors is given by \\( (a+1)(b+1) \\). Since \\( Q \\) has exactly 5 factors, and 5 is a prime number, the only way to express 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is \\( 5 = 5 \\cdot 1 \\). This implies that \\( Q \\) must be of the form \\( p^4 \\), where \\( p \\) is a prime number. Here, the exponent \\( 4 \\) comes from \\( 5-1 \\), and \\( Q \\) has no other prime factors.\n\n### Analysis of Each Statement:\n1. **Statement I: \\( Q \\) is the square of a prime number.**  \n   If \\( Q \\) were the square of a prime number, it would be \\( p^2 \\). The number of factors of \\( p^2 \\) is \\( (2+1) = 3 \\), not 5. Therefore, this statement is **false**.\n\n2. **Statement II: \\( Q \\) is the fourth power of a prime number.**  \n   Since \\( Q \\) must be of the form \\( p^4 \\) to have exactly 5 factors, this statement is **true**.\n\n3. **Statement III: \\( Q \\) is the product of two prime numbers.**  \n   If \\( Q \\) were the product of two distinct primes, it would be \\( p \\cdot q \\). The number of factors of \\( p \\cdot q \\) is \\( (1+1)(1+1) = 4 \\), not 5. Therefore, this statement is **false**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nOnly Statement II is true. Thus, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: C**",

The question is about finding out which statements must be true about Q, given that Q is a positive integer with exactly 5 factors. The options are I, II, III, and the choices given are combinations of these.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Oh right, if a number N has a prime factorization of N = p1^a * p2^b * p3^c..., then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... So each exponent is increased by one and multiplied together.\n\nIn this case, Q has 5 factors. So I need to figure out what exponents would give me 5 when each is increased by one and multiplied. Let's think: 5 is a prime number, so the only way to write it as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 itself. So (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... must equal 5.\n\nThat means that the exponents plus one multiply to 5. Since 5 is prime, the only possibility is that there's only one term in the product. So there's only one exponent, and that exponent plus one equals 5. Therefore, the exponent must be 4. So the prime factorization of Q must be a single prime raised to the 4th power.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me double-check. If the number has 5 factors, then the exponents in the prime factorization plus one multiply to 5. 5 is prime, so the exponents plus one can only be 5 and 1. But since exponents can't be negative, the only possible case is a single prime raised to the 4th power. Because, for example, if it were two primes, like p^1 * q^1, the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1)=4, which is less than 5. So no, that doesn't work.\n\nSo Q must be of the form p^4, where p is a prime. So let's look at the statements:\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime number. Wait, if Q is p^4, then the square of a prime would be p^2. So p^4 is (p^2)^2, which is the square of p squared. But is p^4 the square of a prime? Wait, p is a prime, but p^4 is (p^2)^2. So the square of a prime is p^2. So Q is p^4, which is the fourth power, but not the square of a prime. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. That's not correct because the square would be p^2, but Q is p^4. So statement I is false.\n\nWait, wait a second. Am I mixing something up here? Let me think again. If Q is p^4, then it's the square of p squared. But the square of a prime is p^2. So Q is (p^2)^2, which is not the square of a prime, it's the square of a square of a prime. So statement I is incorrect.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So if Q is p^2, then yes, it's the square of p, a prime. But in our case, Q is p^4, which isn't the square of a prime. Because the square would require exponent 2. So I is not true.\n\nWait, but wait. What about p squared? Oh, no, Q is p^4. So statement I says it's the square of a prime, which would be p^2. So statement I is false.\n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me think again. Let me think about what each statement says.\n\nStatement I: Q is the square of a prime number. So Q = (prime)^2. But if Q has 5 factors, it must be (prime)^4. So statement I is only true if (prime)^4 is equal to (prime)^2, which it's not unless the prime is 1, which isn't a prime. So statement I is false.\n\nStatement II: Q is the fourth power of a prime number. That would be Q = p^4. Which is exactly what we concluded. So statement II is true.\n\nStatement III: Q is the product of two prime numbers. That would be Q = p * q, where p and q are primes. The number of factors in that case would be (1+1)(1+1) = 4. But Q has 5 factors, which is more than 4. So statement III is false.\n\nSo looking at the options, only statement II is true. So the correct answer would be option C) II only.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, the options are:\n\nA) I only\n\nB) III only\n\nC) II only\n\nD) I and II only\n\nE) I and III only\n\nSo the correct choice is C.\n",

The question is saying that Q has 5 factors, and I need to figure out which of the three statements (I, II, III) must be true about Q. The options are A to E, each combining different statements. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Oh right, if a number N can be written as the product of primes raised to their respective exponents, like N = p\u2081^a * p\u2082^b * p\u2083^c * ..., then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc. So each exponent is increased by one and multiplied together.\n\nSo the problem says Q has 5 factors. Hmm, 5 is a prime number, so the product (a+1)(b+1)... must equal 5. Since 5 is prime, the only way to write it as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5*1. So that would mean that there's only one term in the product, right? Because if there were two terms, like (a+1) and (b+1), then 5 could only be broken into 5*1, meaning one of them is 5 and the other is 1.\n\nWait, so that implies that Q must be of the form p^4, where p is a prime number. Because if Q = p^4, then the number of factors is (4+1)=5. Alternatively, could it be a product of two primes, each raised to some power? Let me see. Suppose Q is p^a * q^b, then the number of factors is (a+1)(b+1). For that to be 5, since 5 is prime, one of (a+1) or (b+1) would have to be 5 and the other 1. So, a would be 4 and b would be 0, but wait, b can't be zero because that would make q^0=1, and Q would just be p^4. Or, if a is 0 and b is 4, but that's the same as the other case.

But Q has 5 factors, so this can't be the case. So III is false.\n\nWait, but wait. Maybe I made a mistake.

Let me try to work through it step by step. \n\nThe question says: If Q is a positive integer that has 5 factors, which of the following must be true about Q? Then there are three statements, I, II, III, and I need to figure out which are correct.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Right, if a number Q can be expressed as the product of primes raised to certain powers, then the total number of factors is the product of each exponent plus one. Like, for example, if Q = p^a * q^b, then the number of factors is (a+1)(b+1). \n\nSo, Q has 5 factors. Wait, 5 is a prime number. That means the number of factors must be 5, which is 5 times 1. So, the formula (a+1)(b+1)... must equal 5. Since 5 is prime, the only way to write it as a product is 5*1. So that means one of the exponents plus one is 5, and the others are 1. So, for example, if Q is p^4, because 4+1=5, and any other primes would have exponent 0, which doesn't contribute. \n\nSo Q must be the fourth power of a prime? Wait, no, wait. Let me think. If Q is the square of a prime, like p^2, then the number of factors is 2+1=3. So that gives 3 factors. But we need 5. So maybe it's the fourth power. Let's see: p^4 would have 4+1=5 factors. So yes, that makes sense. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Wait, that would give 3 factors, not 5. So I think statement I is incorrect. Or am I mixing things up?\n\nWait, let me recheck. If Q is the square of a prime, like p^2, then factors are 1, p, p^2. So three factors. So that's 3, not 5. So statement I is saying that Q is the square of a prime. But that would only give 3 factors, not 5. So I must be wrong earlier. So perhaps statement II is correct, because if Q is the fourth power of a prime, like p^4, then the factors are 1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4. That's five factors. So statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime. That would be correct.\n\nWait, but what about statement I? So statement I is incorrect because it's the square of a prime, which gives 3 factors, not 5. So statement II is correct. \n\nWait, but wait, another possibility: if Q is the product of two primes, like p * q, then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1) = 4. So four factors. But we need 5, so that's not possible. So statement III says Q is the product of two primes, which would lead to four factors. So statement III is incorrect.\n\nSo looking back, the correct statements are only statement II. So which option is that? Let me look at the options:\n\nOptions:\nA) I only\nB) III only\nC) II only\nD) I and II only\nE) I and III only\n\nSo the correct answer would be option C, II only.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Did I make a mistake? Because I thought earlier that the number of factors for a number is based on exponents in prime factorization. So for Q to have 5 factors, it must be p^4, because 5 is prime. So that's correct. So statement II is correct.\n\nSo the correct statements are only II. So the answer should be option C. But wait, the options are given as A to E, and looking back, option C is II only.\n\nWait, but another thought: is there any other way for a number to have 5 factors besides being the fourth power of a prime? Like, could it be a cube times something? Let's see, 5 is a prime, so the only way the product of exponents plus one equals 5 is if one exponent is 4 and the others are zero.

Oh right, if a number Q has a prime factorization of the form p^a * q^b * r^c..., then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... and so on for each prime.

Let me read it again.\n\nThe question is about a positive integer Q that has exactly 5 factors. And I need to determine which of the statements I, II, or III must be true about Q. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Oh right, if a number is expressed as a product of primes, like Q = p1^a * p2^b * p3^c..., then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc. So each exponent is increased by one and multiplied together.\n\nWait, so Q has 5 factors. So the product of (a+1)(b+1)... equals 5. But 5 is a prime number, right? So the only way to get 5 as a product is 5*1. That means that the exponents plus one must multiply to 5. So the exponents themselves are such that only one of them is 4, and the rest are 0, because if there's more than one prime factor, then we'd have (a+1)(b+1) etc., which would require both a+1 and b+1 to be factors of 5. But 5 is prime, so the only possibilities are 5 and 1.\n\nSo that means Q must be of the form p^4, where p is a prime number. Because if Q had more than one prime factor, say p^a * q^b, then (a+1)(b+1)=5. Since 5 is prime, one of the terms would have to be 5 and the other 1. So for example, a+1=5 and b+1=1. That would make a=4 and b=0, which means the second prime factor q^0 is 1, so it's just p^4. Alternatively, the exponents could be arranged differently, but in any case, the number of primes can't be more than one.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. If Q had two different primes, like p and q, then the exponents a and b would have to satisfy (a+1)(b+1)=5. Since 5 is prime, one of them is 5, the other is 1. So, for example, a=4, b=0. But b=0 implies that q isn't actually a prime factor of Q. So Q is just p^4. So yeah, it can't have two different primes because that would require another exponent beyond zero, which would require the product to have more than 5 factors.\n\nSo from this, Q must be the fourth power of a prime number. That would make statement II correct. But wait, what about statement I? Statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Well, if Q is p^4, then it's (p^2)^2, which is the square of p squared. Wait, but the square of a prime would be p^2. So if Q is p^4, then it's the square of p squared, but p squared is a composite number unless p is 2, then p squared is 4, which is not prime. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So if Q is p^4, then can we write it as (p^2)^2? Yes. But p^2 is not a prime unless p is 2? Wait, no. p is a prime, so p^2 is a square of a prime. So if Q is p^4, then it's (p^2)^2, which is the square of a square of a prime. Hmm, but does that make Q the square of a prime? No, because p^2 is not a prime. So statement I is saying Q is the square of a prime, which would mean Q = (prime)^2. But if Q is p^4, then that's (p^2)^2, which is the square of a composite number (unless p is 2, but p^2 is 4, which is composite). So statement I is not necessarily true. So statement I is incorrect.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me think again. If Q is p^4, then can it be expressed as the square of a prime? Let's take an example. Let p=2. Then Q=16. Is 16 the square of a prime? The square of 4 is 16, but 4 is not a prime. So 16 isn't the square of a prime. So statement I is false. So statement I is not correct. Therefore, statement I is not necessarily true.\n\nSo statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime. That's correct because, as we determined earlier, Q must be p^4.\n\nWhat about statement III? Statement III says Q is the product of two prime numbers. So if Q is p^4, then it's p multiplied by itself four times. But the product of two primes would mean p * q, where p and q are primes. But Q=p^4 is just a single prime raised to the fourth power, so it's not the product of two primes. So statement III is also false.\n\nWait, but what if the number of factors is 5, but Q is the product of two primes, like p * q? Then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1) = 4, which is 4, not 5. So no, that's not possible. So statement III is definitely false.\n\nSo the only correct statement is II.\n\nBut wait, the options are: \n\nA) I only \n\nB) III only \n\nC) II only \n\nD) I and II only \n\nE) I and III only \n\nSo the correct answer would be C) II only.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought statement I might be correct, but after re-evaluating, I realized that statement I is not correct because Q is p^4, which is the square of p squared, and p squared is not a prime. So statement I is wrong, only statement II is correct.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question is about a positive integer Q that has exactly 5 factors. And I need to determine which of the statements I, II, or III must be true about Q. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Oh right, if a number is expressed as a product of primes, like Q = p1^a * p2^b * p3^c..., then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc. So each exponent is increased by one and multiplied together.\n\nWait, so Q has 5 factors. So the product of (a+1)(b+1)... equals 5. But 5 is a prime number, right? So the only way to get 5 as a product is 5*1. That means that the exponents plus one must multiply to 5. So the exponents themselves are such that only one of them is 4, and the rest are 0, because if there's more than one prime factor, then we'd have (a+1)(b+1) etc., which would require both a+1 and b+1 to be factors of 5. But 5 is prime, so the only possibilities are 5 and 1.\n\nSo that means Q must be of the form p^4, where p is a prime number. Because if Q had more than one prime factor, say p^a * q^b, then (a+1)(b+1)=5. Since 5 is prime, one of the terms would have to be 5 and the other 1. So for example, a+1=5 and b+1=1. That would make a=4 and b=0, which means the second prime factor q^0 is 1, so it's just p^4. Alternatively, the exponents could be arranged differently, but in any case, the number of primes can't be more than one.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. If Q had two different primes, like p and q, then the exponents a and b would have to satisfy (a+1)(b+1)=5. Since 5 is prime, one of them is 5, the other is 1. So, for example, a=4, b=0. But b=0 implies that q isn't actually a prime factor of Q. So Q is just p^4. So yeah, it can't have two different primes because that would require another exponent beyond zero, which would require the product to have more than 5 factors.\n\nSo from this, Q must be the fourth power of a prime number. That would make statement II correct. But wait, what about statement I? Statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Well, if Q is p^4, then it's (p^2)^2, which is the square of p squared. Wait, but the square of a prime would be p^2. So if Q is p^4, then it's the square of p squared, but p squared is a composite number unless p is 2, then p squared is 4, which is not prime. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So if Q is p^4, then can we write it as (p^2)^2? Yes. But p^2 is not a prime unless p is 2? Wait, no. p is a prime, so p^2 is a square of a prime. So if Q is p^4, then it's (p^2)^2, which is the square of a square of a prime. Hmm, but does that make Q the square of a prime? No, because p^2 is not a prime. So statement I is saying Q is the square of a prime, which would mean Q = (prime)^2. But if Q is p^4, then that's (p^2)^2, which is the square of a composite number (unless p is 2, but p^2 is 4, which is composite). So statement I is not necessarily true. So statement I is incorrect.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me think again. If Q is p^4, then can it be expressed as the square of a prime? Let's take an example. Let p=2. Then Q=16. Is 16 the square of a prime? The square of 4 is 16, but 4 is not a prime. So 16 isn't the square of a prime. So statement I is false. So statement I is not correct. Therefore, statement I is not necessarily true.\n\nSo statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime. That's correct because, as we determined earlier, Q must be p^4.\n\nWhat about statement III? Statement III says Q is the product of two prime numbers. So if Q is p^4, then it's p multiplied by itself four times. But the product of two primes would mean p * q, where p and q are primes. But Q=p^4 is just a single prime raised to the fourth power, so it's not the product of two primes. So statement III is also false.\n\nWait, but what if the number of factors is 5, but Q is the product of two primes, like p * q? Then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1) = 4, which is 4, not 5. So no, that's not possible. So statement III is definitely false.\n\nSo the only correct statement is II.\n\nBut wait, the options are: \n\nA) I only \n\nB) III only \n\nC) II only \n\nD) I and II only \n\nE) I and III only \n\nSo the correct answer would be C) II only.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought statement I might be correct, but after re-evaluating, I realized that statement I is not correct because Q is p^4, which is the square of p squared, and p squared is not a prime. So statement I is wrong, only statement II is correct.\n\n\nTo determine which statements about \\( Q \\) must be true, we analyze the number of factors \\( Q \\) has. A positive integer \\( Q \\) with exactly 5 factors implies that its prime factorization must satisfy the condition that the product of one more than each exponent in its prime factorization equals 5. Since 5 is a prime number, the only way to achieve this is if \\( Q \\) is of the form \\( p^4 \\), where \\( p \\) is a prime number. This is because the number of factors is given by \\( (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)\\dots \\), and for 5 to be the product, one exponent must be 4 (since \\( 4+1=5 \\)) and the rest must be 0.\n\n### Analysis of the Statements:\n1. **Statement I: \\( Q \\) is the square of a prime number.**  \n   If \\( Q = p^4 \\), it can be written as \\( (p^2)^2 \\). However, \\( p^2 \\) is not a prime number unless \\( p = 2 \\), but even then, \\( p^2 = 4 \\), which is composite.

Therefore, this statement is false. **This statement is false.**\n\n### Conclusion:\nOnly Statement II is true. \n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about factors of a positive integer Q. The question says Q has 5 factors, and I need to determine which of the statements I, II, or III must be true. The options are A through E, each combining these statements in different ways.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Oh right, the formula for the number of divisors (or factors) is based on the exponents in the prime factorization. So if a number Q is expressed as a product of primes, like Q = p\u2081^a * p\u2082^b * p\u2083^c... then the number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc.\n\nWait, the question says Q has 5 factors. So I need to find what exponents would lead to (a+1)(b+1)... equal to 5. Hmm, 5 is a prime number, so the only way to write it as a product is 5 \u00d7 1. So that means that the exponents plus one multiply to 5. So each exponent plus one must be a factor of 5. Since 5 is prime, only 5 and 1.\n\nSo that implies that Q's prime factorization must have only one prime raised to the 4th power because 4+1=5. Because if there were more than one prime, then the product of (exponents +1) would have to include more than one term, which would require those terms to multiply to 5. But 5 can't be factored into smaller integers except 1 and 5. So for example, if there were two primes, each of their exponents plus one would have to be 5 and 1, but that would mean one exponent is 4 and the other is 0. But wait, exponent 0 would mean that prime isn't actually present, right? So that can't be the case. So Q must be the square of a prime? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 4+1 is 5. So the exponent is 4, so Q is p^4, where p is a prime.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Let me think again. So if Q is p^4, then the number of factors is 4+1=5, which fits. Alternatively, if Q is p^4 * q^0, which is just p^4. So yeah, only one prime factor with exponent 4.\n\nSo now let's look at the statements.\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime number. Hmm. Wait, p squared would be p^2. But here Q is p^4. So Q is the fourth power of a prime, not the square. So statement I would be true only if Q is p squared, which would have 3 factors (since 2+1=3). But in our case, Q has 5 factors, so statement I is not correct? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, statement I says Q is the square of a prime. If Q is p^4, then it's the square of p squared. Because (p\u00b2)^2 = p^4. So if p is a prime, p squared is also a prime? No, wait, p squared is a square of a prime, which is not a prime itself. So wait, is statement I saying Q is the square of a prime, meaning Q equals (prime)^2? Because if Q is p^4, then it's the square of p^2, which is a square but not a prime. So statement I would be incorrect. Wait, no, wait. Let's think again.\n\nWait, statement I: Q is the square of a prime. So if Q is (prime)^2, then the number of factors is 3, right? Because exponents would be 2, so 2+1=3. But in our case, Q has 5 factors, which would come from exponent 4. So statement I would not be correct in that case. So statement I is false.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think: Suppose Q is the square of a prime. Then Q = p\u00b2. The factors of p\u00b2 are 1, p, p\u00b2. So that's 3 factors. But the question states Q has 5 factors, so statement I can't be correct. Therefore, statement I is not necessarily true, because Q having 5 factors would require it to be p^4, not p\u00b2. So I would be false.\n\nWait, no, wait another moment. Maybe I'm getting confused. Let me double-check. The number of factors of Q is 5. So, as per the formula, the exponents plus one multiply to 5. 5 is prime, so it must be that there's only one term, meaning Q is p^4. So statement I: Q is the square of a prime. So p^4 is (p\u00b2)^2, but that's the square of p\u00b2, which is not a prime. So statement I is incorrect. So statement I is false.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Statement I says Q is the square of a prime, which would mean Q = p\u00b2. But in our case, Q is p^4. So statement I is not correct. So statement I is false.\n\nWait, so statement I is incorrect. So options that include statement I (A, D, E) are incorrect. So let's look at the other statements.\n\nStatement II: Q is the fourth power of a prime. Well, according to our earlier analysis, Q must be p^4. So statement II is correct.\n\nStatement III: Q is the product of two prime numbers. So that would imply Q has two distinct primes, each raised to the first power. Because product of two primes would be p*q, where p and q are primes. The number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1)=4. But our Q has 5 factors, so statement III is incorrect. So statement III is false.\n\nSo the correct statements are only statement II. So looking at the options, option C is II only.\n\nWait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistake. Let me go through each step again.\n\nNumber of factors is 5. So 5 is prime, so the only way for (a+1)(b+1)... =5 is when all but one exponent are zero and one exponent is 4. So Q must be p^4. So statement II is correct.\n\nStatement I: Q is the square of a prime. So if Q is p^4, it's (p\u00b2)^2, but p\u00b2 is not a prime. So statement I is false.\n\nStatement III: product of two primes. So that would be p*q, which would have (1+1)(1+1)=4 factors. But Q has 5, so statement III is false.\n\nSo only statement II is correct. Therefore, the answer is C, which is II only.\n",
