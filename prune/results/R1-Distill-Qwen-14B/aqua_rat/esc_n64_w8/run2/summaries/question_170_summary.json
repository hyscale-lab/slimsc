      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\n\"A man spends 810 in buying trousers at Rs 70 each and shirts at Rs 30 each. What will be the ratio of trousers and shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased?\"\n\nWait, the question is about finding the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers possible with 810 Rs. Hmm. So the key here is to maximize the number of trousers he buys without exceeding his total budget.\n\nLet me break this down. The man has a total of 810 Rs. Each trouser costs 70 Rs, and each shirt costs 30 Rs. He wants to buy as many trousers as possible. So, the approach should be to find out the maximum number of trousers he can buy, and then see how many shirts he can buy with the remaining money.\n\nLet me think about how to set this up mathematically. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. The total cost would be 70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nBut since we're looking to maximize T, we need to find the largest integer value of T such that when you subtract 70*T from 810, the remainder is divisible by 30 (since each shirt costs 30). Because if the remainder isn't divisible by 30, he can't buy a fraction of a shirt, right?\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is: the total amount spent on shirts must be a multiple of 30, so 810 -70*T must be divisible by 30.\n\nWait, let's think about it step by step. The maximum number of trousers he can buy is when the remaining money after buying T trousers is exactly enough to buy some number of shirts. So, let's find the maximum T such that 70*T \u2264 810.\n\nCalculating that: 810 divided by 70. Let me compute that. 70 times 11 is 770, and 70 times 12 is 840. Oh wait, 70*12 is 840 which is more than 810. So the maximum possible T is 11, because 70*11 = 770. Then, the remaining money is 810 -770 =40. Wait, 40 isn't enough to buy a shirt because each shirt is 30. Oh, wait, 40 can buy one shirt (30) and have 10 left, but 10 isn't enough for another shirt. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, 70*11 is 770. So 810-770=40. 40 divided by 30 is 1 with a remainder of 10. So he can buy one shirt, but then there's 10 left, which isn't enough for another shirt. But that's okay, because the question is about the ratio when he buys the maximum number of trousers. So he buys 11 trousers and 1 shirt. Wait, but wait, that would make the ratio 11:1.\n\nBut wait, let me check: 11*70=770. 1*30=30. 770+30=800. Oh wait, that's only 800, but he has 810. So there's 10 Rs left. But he can't buy any more shirts because they cost 30. So he can't spend all 810, but perhaps that's acceptable because the problem says he 'spends 810 in buying', so perhaps he doesn't have to spend all of it. Or does he? The problem says 'spend 810', so I think he must use all the money. Hmm, that's a point I'm not sure about.\n\nWait, the problem states that he spends 810. So he must spend all of it. So 70*T +30*S =810.\n\nSo, the initial approach of finding T as the maximum integer such that 70*T \u2264810, but also ensuring that (810 -70*T) is divisible by 30.\n\nSo, let's try T=11: 70*11=770, 810-770=40. 40 is not divisible by 30. So that's a problem because S would have to be 40/30=1.333, which isn't possible. So T=11 doesn't work because it leaves 40, which isn't a multiple of 30.\n\nSo, we need to find the largest T such that (810 -70*T) is divisible by 30.\n\nAlternatively, we can model this as:\n\n70*T +30*S =810\n\nWe can simplify this equation. Let's divide both sides by 10: 7T +3S =81.\n\nWe can rearrange this to 3S =81 -7T.\n\nSo, 81 -7T must be divisible by 3. Since 81 is divisible by 3 (81/3=27), 7T must also leave a remainder that when subtracted from 81, the result is divisible by 3.\n\nWait, 7 mod 3 is 1, because 7 divided by 3 is 2 with remainder 1. So 7T mod 3 is equal to (1*T) mod 3, which is T mod3.\n\nSo, 81 mod3 is 0. So 7T mod3 must be equal to (something that makes 81-7T divisible by 3). Let me think: 81 is 0 mod3. So 7T mod3 must also be 0 mod3, because 0 - (7T mod3) must be 0 mod3. So 7T mod3=0 \u2192 T mod3=0.\n\nSo T must be a multiple of 3. So possible values for T are 3,6,9,12 etc. But since the maximum T can't exceed 810/70=11.57, so maximum T is 11. So possible T values are 9 and 6, because 12 is 12*70=840 which is more than 810.\n\nWait, let me see. 11 is not a multiple of 3. So the maximum T that is a multiple of 3 is 9. Let me check if 9 works.\n\n70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180 divided by 30 is 6. So S=6. That works. So T=9, S=6.\n\nSo the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6, which can be simplified to 3:2.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. Earlier, I thought that T=11 is possible, but then the remaining money wasn't enough for another shirt. But since the problem requires that the total expenditure is exactly 810, T=11 isn't possible because 70*11=770, and 810-770=40, which isn't a multiple of 30. So T=11 is invalid.\n\nSo the next possible T is 9. Let's check T=9: 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. So 6 shirts. So total spent is 630+180=810, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, is there a larger T than 9 that is a multiple of 3? Let's see. 9 is 3*3, 12 is 3*4, but 12*70=840>810. So 9 is the maximum possible T that is a multiple of 3, allowing S to be an integer.\n\nWait, but what if T is not a multiple of 3? Let's see if there are any T values greater than 9 that are not multiples of 3 but still allow S to be an integer.\n\nSo, let's try T=10. 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3 with a remainder of 20. So S would be 3.666..., which isn't an integer. So T=10 doesn't work.\n\nNext, T=11: 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40/30=1.333. Not an integer.\n\nWhat about T=8? Let's see. 70*8=560. 810-560=250. 250/30=8.333. Not integer.\n\nT=7: 70*7=490. 810-490=320. 320/30\u224810.666. Not integer.\n\nT=10: as above, doesn't work.\n\nSo, the next possible T is 9, which works.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But wait, the question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2, but the options are given as the number of trousers. So looking at the options:\n\nOptions are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11. So the correct answer is A)9.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased\". Oh, wait, I think I misread that. The question is asking for the ratio, but the options are just the number of trousers. Hmm, no, the options are labeled as A)9 Trousers, etc. So the question is, what is the number of trousers when the maximum possible is bought, along with the corresponding number of shirts. So the answer is 9, so option A.\n\nWait, but why did I earlier think that 11 is the maximum? Because 70*11=770, but that leaves 40, which isn't divisible by 30. So he can't buy a shirt, so 11 isn't a valid option because he can't spend all 810.\n\nSo the maximum number of trousers that allows him to spend all 810 is 9.\n\nSo the answer is 9, option A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased with 810 Rs, given that each trouser costs 70 Rs and each shirt costs 30 Rs, we need to ensure that the total expenditure is exactly 810 Rs. This means the equation \\( 70T + 30S = 810 \\) must hold, where \\( T \\) is the number of trousers and \\( S \\) is the number of shirts.\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the equation\nDivide the entire equation by 10 to simplify:\n\\[\n7T + 3S = 81\n\\]\nRearranging, we get:\n\\[\n3S = 81 - 7T\n\\]\nThis implies that \\( 81 - 7T \\) must be divisible by 3 for \\( S \\) to be an integer.\n\n### Step 2: Determine constraints for \\( T \\)\nSince \\( 7 \\mod 3 = 1 \\), the term \\( 7T \\mod 3 \\) simplifies to \\( T \\mod 3 \\). For \\( 81 - 7T \\) to be divisible by 3, \\( T \\) must also be divisible by 3. Therefore, \\( T \\) can only take values like 3, 6, 9, etc.\n\n### Step 3: Find the maximum valid \\( T \\)\nThe maximum possible \\( T \\) is limited by the budget:\n\\[\nT \\leq \\frac{810}{70} \\approx 11.57\n\\]\nThus, the largest integer \\( T \\) can be is 11. However, \\( T = 11 \\) is not divisible by 3, so the next valid \\( T \\) is 9.\n\n### Step 4: Verify \\( T = 9 \\)\nFor \\( T = 9 \\):\n\\[\n70 \\times 9 = 630\n\\]\nThe remaining amount is:\n\\[\n810 - 630 = 180\n\\]\nThis allows for:\n\\[\nS = \\frac{180}{30} = 6\n\\]\nThus, \\( T = 9 \\) and \\( S = 6 \\) satisfy the equation, and the total expenditure is exactly 810 Rs.\n\n### Step 5: Check higher \\( T \\) values\n- For \\( T = 10 \\): \\( 70 \\times 10 = 700 \\), leaving \\( 810 - 700 = 110 \\), which is not divisible by 30.\n- For \\( T = 11 \\): \\( 70 \\times 11 = 770 \\), leaving \\( 810 - 770 = 40 \\), which is not divisible by 30.\n\nThus, \\( T = 9 \\) is the maximum valid number of trousers that allows the man to spend exactly 810 Rs.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe maximum number of trousers that can be purchased is **9**, with the corresponding number of shirts being **6**. The ratio of trousers to shirts is \\( 9:6 \\), but the question only asks for the number of trousers, which is 9.\n\nAnswer: A",

For \\( 81 - 7T \\) to be divisible by 3, \\( T \\) must also be divisible by 3.

The ratio of trousers to shirts is \\( 9:6 \\), but the question only asks for the number of trousers, which is 9.\n\nAnswer: A",

Let me approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's rearrange the equation to express S in terms of T.\n\n70T + 30S = 810\n\nSubtract 70T from both sides:\n\n30S = 810 -70T\n\nDivide both sides by 30:\n\nS = (810 -70T)/30\n\nSimplify that:\n\nS = (810/30) - (70/30) T\n\nSimplify the fractions:\n\n810 divided by 30 is 27. 70 divided by 30 is 7/3, which is approximately 2.333...\n\nSo S = 27 - (7/3) T\n\nBut S must be an integer because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So (810 -70T) must be divisible by 30, which implies that 70T must leave a remainder such that when subtracted from 810, it's a multiple of 30.\n\nAlternatively, we can think about the equation modulo 30. Let me see:\n\n70T mod 30 + 30S mod30 = 810 mod30\n\nBut 30S mod30 is 0, 810 mod30 is 0, because 810 divided by 30 is 27. So:\n\n70T mod30 must be 0.\n\n70 mod30 is 10. So 10*T mod30 =0.\n\nSo 10*T must be a multiple of 30. Which implies that T must be a multiple of 3. Because 10*T = 30k \u2192 T=3k.\n\nSo T must be a multiple of 3. So possible values are 3,6,9,12, etc., but we can't have T so high that 70T exceeds 810.\n\nLet me compute the maximum T possible. 70*T \u2264810 \u2192 T \u2264 810/70 \u224811.57. So the maximum integer T is 11.\n\nWait, but T must be a multiple of 3. So the largest T possible is 9, 11 isn't a multiple of 3. Wait, 9 is the next after 6. Let me check: 9 is 3*3, 12 would be 3*4, but 70*12=840, which is more than 810. So the maximum T would be 9.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's test T=9. \n\n70*9=630. \n\nRemaining money: 810-630=180. \n\nNumber of shirts S=180/30=6. \n\nSo 9 trousers and 6 shirts. Ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nBut wait, could there be a higher T that isn't a multiple of 3? Because maybe if T isn't a multiple of 3, but S is still an integer, then that would allow for more T.\n\nWait, no, because earlier analysis suggested that 70T must be a multiple of 30, so that when subtracted from 810 (which is a multiple of 30), 810-70T is also a multiple of 30. So 70T must be a multiple of 30. \n\n70T = 30*S \u2192 70T must be divisible by 30. 70 and 30 have a GCD of 10. So 70T divisible by 30 \u2192 T must be divisible by 3, because 70 is 7*10, and 30 is 3*10. So 70T = 10*7*T. For this to be divisible by 30=10*3, 7*T must be divisible by 3. Since 7 and 3 are coprime, T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo T must be a multiple of 3. So maximum T possible is 9, because 11 is not a multiple of 3.\n\nWait, but let's test T=11. 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40/30 is 1.333, which is not an integer. So S would be 1.333, which isn't possible. So T=11 is invalid.\n\nWhat about T=10? 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110/30=3.666, which is not an integer. So S=3.666, invalid.\n\nT=9: 70*9=630. 810-630=180 \u2192 180/30=6 shirts. So that's valid.\n\nWhat about T=8? 70*8=560. 810-560=250. 250/30 is 8.333, which is not integer. So no.\n\nT=7: 70*7=490. 810-490=320. 320/30\u224810.666. Not integer.\n\nT=6: 70*6=420. 810-420=390. 390/30=13 shirts. So 6 trousers and 13 shirts. But we're looking for maximum T, so 9 is better.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9, with 6 shirts. So the ratio of T:S is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question asks for the ratio of trousers to shirts when maximum T is bought. So the ratio is 9:6, but the options are just the number of trousers. Wait, looking back at the question.\n\nWait, the options are A)9, B)8, etc. So the question is, what is the ratio of trousers to shirts, but the options are giving the number of trousers. Hmm, perhaps the question is phrased as: \"what will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" But the options are just numbers, not ratios. Wait, looking back:\n\nOptions are A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. So the question is asking for the number of trousers when maximum possible is bought, which would be 9. So the answer is A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The question says \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So perhaps the ratio is T:S, but the options are giving the number of trousers. So perhaps the options are the possible number of trousers, and we have to pick the maximum possible. So in that case, the answer is 9, option A.\n\nWait, but another way: if you have 9 trousers and 6 shirts, the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2. But the options don't give the ratio; they give the number of trousers, so the correct answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nSo the correct answer is A)9.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where a man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. Trousers cost 70 each and shirts are 30 each. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers possible. The options are given as A to E, each indicating a certain number of trousers. Hmm, I need to figure this out.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. He wants to maximize the number of trousers he buys. So, he should spend as much as possible on trousers without exceeding his total budget of 810. The remaining money will then be spent on shirts.\n\nLet me denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S. So the total cost equation would be 70*T + 30*S = 810. But since he wants the maximum T, I should find the largest possible T such that the remaining money can be spent on whole shirts. That means both T and S have to be integers.\n\nSo, let's try to solve for S in terms of T. Rearranging the equation:\n\n30*S = 810 - 70*T\n=> S = (810 -70*T)/30\n\nS needs to be a whole number, so (810 -70*T) must be divisible by 30. Let me think about how to find T such that 810 -70*T is a multiple of 30.\n\nWait, 70 is equal to 7*10, and 30 is 3*10. So maybe I can factor out 10 from the equation. Let's see:\n\n70*T = 10*7*T\n810 = 10*81\n\nSo, 10*(81 -7*T) = 30*S \u2192 81 -7*T must be divisible by 3, because 10*(something) = 30*S \u2192 (something) must be divisible by 3.\n\nSo, 81 -7*T must be divisible by 3. Let's write that as 81 \u2261 7*T mod 3.\n\nWait, 81 is divisible by 3 (since 8+1=9, which is divisible by 3). So 81 mod 3 is 0.\n\nSo, 7*T mod 3 must also be 0. Because 81 -7*T \u2261 0 mod 3 \u2192 0 -7*T \u22610 mod 3 \u2192 -7*T \u22610 mod3 \u2192 7*T \u22610 mod3.\n\nBut 7 mod3 is 1 (because 7/3=2 with remainder 1). So 7*T mod3 is same as (1*T) mod3. So, T must be congruent to 0 mod3. That is, T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo, possible T values are 3,6,9, etc. But we need the maximum T such that 70*T \u2264810.\n\nLet's compute the maximum possible T without considering the shirts. 810 divided by 70. Let me calculate 70*11=770, which is less than 810. 70*12=840, which is more than 810. So maximum T can't be more than 11. But wait, let's check.\n\nWait, 70*11=770. Then, 810-770=40. Now, 40 divided by 30 is 1.333, which isn't an integer. So S would be 1.333, which isn't allowed. So T can't be 11.\n\nLet me try T=10. 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666. Not integer. So S isn't integer here. So T=10 is also not possible.\n\nNext, T=9. 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. Oh, that's an integer. So S=6. So when T=9, S=6. So the ratio would be 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But wait, the question is about the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is bought. But is 9 the maximum possible T where S is integer?\n\nWait, let me check the next possible T that is a multiple of 3. The next after 9 is 12, but 70*12=840>810, so that's too much. So the next lower multiple of 3 is 9, which works.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought T could be 11, but S wasn't integer. Let me see if there's another way. Maybe T doesn't have to be a multiple of 3, but the equation 81-7T must be divisible by 3. So 7T mod3 must be 0. Since 7 mod3 is 1, T mod3 must be 0. So T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo the possible Ts are 3,6,9. Let me see:\n\nAt T=9: S=6 (as above).\n\nAt T=6: 70*6=420. 810-420=390. 390/30=13. So S=13. So the ratio would be 6:13.\n\nAt T=3: 70*3=210. 810-210=600. 600/30=20. So S=20. Ratio 3:20.\n\nSo the maximum T that works is 9, giving S=6. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the options don't list the ratio, they just give the number of trousers. The options are A)9, B)8, etc. So the correct answer is A)9 Trousers.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe there's a way to buy more than 9 trousers without S being a fraction. Because perhaps when T is not a multiple of 3, but the remaining amount is still divisible by 30.\n\nWait, let's re-examine. Let me try T=10. 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by30 is 3 with remainder 20. So S=3, and 20 left. That's no good.\n\nT=11:70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40/30 is 1 with 10 left. Not good.\n\nT=8:70*8=560. 810-560=250. 250/30 is 8 with 10 left. So S=8.333. Not integer.\n\nWait, what about T=7? 70*7=490. 810-490=320. 320/30=10.666. So S is not integer.\n\nHmm, what about T=12? 70*12=840>810. So no.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach. Maybe T doesn't have to be a multiple of 3, but the condition is that 810 -70T must be divisible by 30. Let me represent it as:\n\n(810 -70T) must be divisible by 30.\n\nSo 810 mod30 is 0 (because 810=30*27). 70 mod30 is 10. So 70T mod30 is 10T mod30.\n\nSo 810 -70T \u2261 0 mod30 \u2192 0 -10T \u22610 mod30 \u2192 -10T \u22610 mod30 \u2192 10T \u22610 mod30 \u2192 T must be such that T is a multiple of 3, since 10 and 30 share a factor of 10. So 10T must be divisible by 30 \u2192 T must be divisible by 3. So yeah, T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo the maximum possible T is 9, as 9*70=630, leaving 180 for shirts, which is 6 shirts. So the ratio is 9:6 \u2192 3:2. So the correct answer is A)9 Trousers.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, a man buys trousers and shirts. The total he spends is 810 rupees. Each trouser costs 70 rupees, and each shirt is 30 rupees. The question is asking about the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. And the options are about how many trousers he buys in that case.\n\nAlright, so I need to figure out how many trousers and shirts he buys such that the total is 810, and the number of trousers is as large as possible. Then find the ratio of trousers to shirts in that scenario.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Let's say the number of trousers is T, and the number of shirts is S. Then the total cost would be 70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nWe need to maximize T. So, I should find the maximum possible T such that (810 -70*T) is divisible by 30, because the remaining money after buying T trousers should be exactly divisible by the shirt's price to buy integer shirts.\n\nSo, 70*T +30*S =810 \u2192 30*S = 810 -70*T \u2192 S = (810 -70T)/30. Since S must be an integer, (810 -70T) must be divisible by 30.\n\nLet me simplify (810 -70T) divided by 30. Let's see, 810 \u00f730 is 27, and 70 \u00f730 is 7/3. So, 810-70T =30*(27) -30*(7T/3) \u2192 Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's factor out 10 from 70 and 30.\n\n70 =10*7, 30=10*3. So, the equation becomes 10*(7T +3S) = 810 \u2192 7T +3S =81. So, 7T +3S=81.\n\nWe need to find integer values T and S such that 7T +3S=81, and T is as large as possible.\n\nSo, to maximize T, we can try T=11,10, etc., and see if S comes out as an integer.\n\nLet me try T=11. Then 7*11=77. 81-77=4. So 3S=4 \u2192 S=4/3. Not integer. So no good.\n\nNext, T=10. 7*10=70. 81-70=11. 3S=11 \u2192 S=11/3\u22483.666. Not integer. So no.\n\nT=9. 7*9=63. 81-63=18. 3S=18 \u2192 S=6. That's integer! So T=9, S=6. So that works.\n\nWait, but let's check if a higher T is possible. Because sometimes, maybe T can be higher if the remaining amount is still a multiple of 30.\n\nWait, I think my initial approach was correct, but let me confirm.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of 70*T \u2264810. So maximum T without considering shirts is 810//70. 70*11=770, 70*12=840 which is more than 810. So T can be up to 11, but as we saw, T=11 doesn't give integer shirts.\n\nWait, so next step: find T such that (810 -70T) is divisible by 30.\n\nAnother approach: 810 -70T must be divisible by 30. Let me write this as 810 \u226170T mod30.\n\nBut 70 mod30 is 70-2*30=10 \u2192 70\u226110 mod30.\n\nSo, 810 mod30: 810 \u00f730 is 27, so 810 is 0 mod30.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, a man buys trousers and shirts. The total he spends is 810 rupees. Each trouser costs 70 rupees, and each shirt is 30 rupees. The question is asking about the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. And the options are about how many trousers he buys in that case.\n\nAlright, so I need to figure out how many trousers and shirts he buys such that the total is 810, and the number of trousers is as large as possible. Then find the ratio of trousers to shirts in that scenario.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Let's say the number of trousers is T, and the number of shirts is S. Then the total cost would be 70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nWe need to maximize T. So, I should find the maximum possible T such that (810 -70*T) is divisible by 30, because the remaining money after buying T trousers should be exactly divisible by the shirt's price to buy integer shirts.\n\nSo, 70*T +30*S =810 \u2192 30*S = 810 -70*T \u2192 S = (810 -70T)/30. Since S must be an integer, (810 -70T) must be divisible by 30.\n\nLet me simplify (810 -70T) divided by 30. Let's see, 810 \u00f730 is 27, and 70 \u00f730 is 7/3. So, 810-70T =30*(27) -30*(7T/3) \u2192 Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's factor out 10 from 70 and 30.\n\n70 =10*7, 30=10*3. So, the equation becomes 10*(7T +3S) = 810 \u2192 7T +3S =81. So, 7T +3S=81.\n\nWe need to find integer values T and S such that 7T +3S=81, and T is as large as possible.\n\nSo, to maximize T, we can try T=11,10, etc., and see if S comes out as an integer.\n\nLet me try T=11. Then 7*11=77. 81-77=4. So 3S=4 \u2192 S=4/3. Not integer. So no good.\n\nNext, T=10. 7*10=70. 81-70=11. 3S=11 \u2192 S=11/3\u22483.666. Not integer. So no.\n\nT=9. 7*9=63. 81-63=18. 3S=18 \u2192 S=6. That's integer! So T=9, S=6. So that works.\n\nWait, but let's check if a higher T is possible. Because sometimes, maybe T can be higher if the remaining amount is still a multiple of 30.\n\nWait, I think my initial approach was correct, but let me confirm.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of 70*T \u2264810. So maximum T without considering shirts is 810//70. 70*11=770, 70*12=840 which is more than 810. So T can be up to 11, but as we saw, T=11 doesn't give integer shirts.\n\nWait, so next step: find T such that (810 -70T) is divisible by 30.\n\nAnother approach: 810 -70T must be divisible by 30. Let me write this as 810 \u226170T mod30.\n\nBut 70 mod30 is 70-2*30=10 \u2192 70\u226110 mod30.\n\nSo, 810 mod30: 810 \u00f730 is 27, so 810 is 0 mod30. So 70T mod30 must be 0.\n\nSo 10*T \u22610 mod30 \u2192 10T must be a multiple of 30 \u2192 T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo T must be 3,6,9,12, etc. But since 70*T can't exceed 810, T can't be more than 11.\n\nSo possible T values are 3,6,9. Let's check each.\n\nT=9: 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6 \u2192 S=6. So that works.\n\nT=12: 70*12=840>810 \u2192 can't.\n\nT=6: 70*6=420. 810-420=390. 390/30=13. So S=13. That's also possible, but T=9 is higher than 6.\n\nT=3: 210. 810-210=600. 600/30=20 \u2192 S=20. But T=9 is better.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9. So the ratio is T:S =9:6 \u2192 simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but the question is about the ratio when maximum T is purchased. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nLooking at the options, the question asks for the ratio, but the options are given as the number of trousers. The options are:\n\nA)9 Trousers\n\nB)8\n\nC)10\n\nD)7\n\nE)11\n\nWait, wait, no.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here. Let me read it again. A man spends 810 rupees buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. I need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are A to E, each giving a number of trousers. Hmm, wait, the question says the ratio, but the options are just numbers of trousers. Oh, maybe I'm supposed to find how many trousers he bought, which would be part of the ratio.\n\nSo the goal is to maximize the number of trousers. That makes sense because if he buys as many trousers as possible, the ratio will change accordingly. Let me think about how to model this.\n\nLet's define variables. Let the number of trousers be t and the number of shirts be s. The total cost is 810 rupees. So the equation would be:\n\n70t + 30s = 810\n\nI need to find integer values of t and s that satisfy this equation, with t as large as possible. Because we can't buy a fraction of a trouser or shirt, t and s must be whole numbers.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation to solve for s in terms of t. Subtract 70t from both sides:\n\n30s = 810 - 70t\n\nDivide both sides by 30:\n\ns = (810 - 70t) / 30\n\nSimplify that. Let me compute 810 divided by 30. 30*27 is 810, so that's 27. Then 70t divided by 30 is (7t)/3. So:\n\ns = 27 - (7t/3)\n\nBut s has to be an integer. So (7t)/3 must be an integer because 27 is an integer. That implies that t must be a multiple of 3. Because 7 and 3 are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1), t must be divisible by 3.\n\nSo t can be 0, 3, 6, 9, etc., but we have to make sure that s is non-negative. Let's find the maximum possible t.\n\nSo t must be as large as possible such that s is >=0.\n\nSo 27 - (7t/3) >= 0\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\n81 -7t >=0\n\nSo 7t <=81\n\nt <= 81/7. Let's compute that. 7*11 is 77, 7*12 is 84 which is too big. So 81/7 is approximately 11.57. Since t must be an integer, the maximum t could be 11? But wait, earlier we found that t must be a multiple of 3. Because s has to be an integer. So t can't be 11, because 11 isn't a multiple of 3.\n\nWait, so the next lower multiple of 3 is 9. Let me check t=9.\n\nt=9:\n\ns = 27 - (7*9)/3 = 27 - 21/3 = 27 -7 = 20. So s=20, which is positive. That works.\n\nWait, but is t=12 possible? Let's check t=12.\n\nt=12 is a multiple of 3. Let's compute s.\n\ns=27 - (7*12)/3 =27 - 28 = -1. Oh, that's negative. So s can't be negative. So t=12 is not allowed. So the maximum t is 9.\n\nSo when t=9, s=20. So the ratio is 9 trousers to 20 shirts. But the question is about the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So the number of trousers is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Are there any other t values between 9 and 12 that are multiples of 3? No, 9, 12 are the only ones in that range. So t=9 is the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of it as trying t values starting from the maximum possible (which would be 810/70, but that's not necessarily an integer). Let's compute 810/70. 70*11=770, 70*12=840. 810 is between those, so t can't be 12. So the maximum t is 11, but earlier I thought t must be a multiple of 3. Hmm, wait, that's a conflict.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. Because I thought that s must be an integer, so (810 -70t) must be divisible by 30. So 70t must be congruent to 810 mod 30.\n\nWait, 70 mod 30 is 10, because 30*2=60, 70-60=10. So 70t mod30 is 10t mod30.\n\n810 mod30 is 0, because 810=30*27. So 10t \u22610 mod30.\n\nWhich implies that 10t is a multiple of 30. So 10t =30k, which implies t=3k. So t must be a multiple of 3. So that brings me back to the initial conclusion that t must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo t can be 0,3,6,9,12,... but considering the cost, t can't be higher than 11 as 70*12=840>810.\n\nSo maximum t is 9, because t=12 is too high. So t=9, s=20.\n\nSo the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:20. But the question is asking for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the number of trousers is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, A is 9 Trousers, which is the number of trousers, not the ratio. Oh, the question says, \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So the ratio is 9:20. But the options don't have ratios, they have numbers of trousers. Wait, that's confusing.\n\nWait, the question says, \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So the ratio would be t:s, which is 9:20. But the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are A)9 Trousers, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11.\n\nSo the options are giving the number of trousers, not the ratio.

The question might actually be asking for the number of trousers, not the ratio. Because the options are numbers of trousers, not ratios.

Oh, the question says, \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So the ratio is 9:20. But the options don't have ratios, they have numbers of trousers. Wait, that's confusing.\n\nWait, the question says, \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So the ratio would be t:s, which is 9:20. But the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are A)9 Trousers, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11.\n\nSo the options are giving the number of trousers, not the ratio. So perhaps the question is asking for the number of trousers when maximum is bought, and the options are the number of trousers. Because the ratio is t:s, but the options are numbers.\n\nWait, the question says, \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question might actually be asking for the number of trousers, not the ratio. Because the options are numbers of trousers, not ratios. So in that case, the answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, and they meant the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts, but the options are just the number of trousers, so perhaps the question is just asking for the number of trousers when maximum is bought.\n\nSo the answer is 9, which is option A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by defining variables: let \\( t \\) be the number of trousers and \\( s \\) be the number of shirts. The total cost equation is:\n\n\\[\n70t + 30s = 810\n\\]\n\nRearranging for \\( s \\):\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{810 - 70t}{30}\n\\]\n\nFor \\( s \\) to be an integer, \\( 810 - 70t \\) must be divisible by 30. Simplifying \\( 70t \\mod 30 \\), we find that \\( t \\) must be a multiple of 3. Thus, \\( t \\) can only take values like 0, 3, 6, 9, etc.\n\nNext, we determine the maximum \\( t \\) such that \\( s \\geq 0 \\). Substituting \\( t = 9 \\):\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{810 - 70(9)}{30} = \\frac{810 - 630}{30} = \\frac{180}{30} = 20\n\\]\n\nThis gives \\( s = 20 \\), which is valid. For \\( t = 12 \\):\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{810 - 70(12)}{30} = \\frac{810 - 840}{30} = \\frac{-30}{30} = -1\n\\]\n\nThis results in \\( s = -1 \\), which is invalid. Therefore, the maximum valid \\( t \\) is 9, with \\( s = 20 \\). The ratio of trousers to shirts is \\( 9:20 \\), but the question asks for the number of trousers when the maximum is purchased. Thus, the answer is 9.\n\nAnswer: A",

Oh, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh, perhaps the options are the possible maximum number of trousers he can buy, and from those, I have to find the corresponding number of shirts, then find the ratio.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So, I think the main goal is to find the maximum number of trousers he can buy with 810 rupees, and then determine the ratio between the number of trousers and shirts in that scenario.\n\nSo, let's break it down. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S.\n\nThe total cost is 70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nWe want to maximize T. That means we should buy as many trousers as possible, and then see how many shirts can be bought with the remaining money.\n\nBut wait, it's possible that after buying T trousers, the remaining money might not be enough to buy any shirts. Or maybe it's possible to buy some shirts.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify whether he must buy at least one shirt. So, perhaps the maximum T is when the remaining money is zero or can't buy another shirt.\n\nWait, but 70*T has to be less than or equal to 810. So, T can be up to 810/70. Let me calculate that.\n\n810 divided by 70 is... 70 times 11 is 770, 70 times 12 is 840. So 11*70=770, which is less than 810. 12*70=840 which is more than 810. So maximum T is 11.\n\nWait, but 11*70=770. Then 810-770=40. 40 is the remaining money. Can he buy any shirts with that?

But wait, if T is maximum, perhaps we can't buy any shirts because the remaining is less than 30. Let me check.\n\nWait, 70*11 is 770, 810-770=40. 40 is more than 30, so S=1. So T=11, S=1. Ratio of T to S is 11:1.\n\nWait, but the options are only about the number of trousers. So looking at the options, E is 11 Trousers.

Wait, but the way it's phrased is \"the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So yes, T is maximized.\n\nWait, but let me think again. So T must be as large as possible. So T=11, and then S= (810 -70*11)/30.\n\n70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40/30 = 1.333, which is 1 shirt with 10 rupees left. So he can buy 1 shirt.\n\nSo the ratio is 11:1. But the options don't have that.

The total expenditure must exactly equal 810 rupees, and the remaining money after buying trousers must be divisible by 30 to purchase shirts.\n\nLet \\( T \\) represent the number of trousers and \\( S \\) represent the number of shirts. The total cost equation is:\n\n\\[\n70T + 30S = 810\n\\]\n\nTo maximize \\( T \\), we calculate the maximum possible \\( T \\) such that \\( 70T \\leq 810 \\) and \\( 810 - 70T \\) is divisible by 30.\n\n1. **For \\( T = 11 \\):**  \n   \\[\n   70 \\times 11 = 770, \\quad 810 - 770 = 40\n   \\]  \n   \\( 40 \\) is not divisible by 30, so \\( T = 11 \\) is not valid.\n\n2. **For \\( T = 10 \\):**  \n   \\[\n   70 \\times 10 = 700, \\quad 810 - 700 = 110\n   \\]  \n   \\( 110 \\) is not divisible by 30, so \\( T = 10 \\) is not valid.\n\n3. **For \\( T = 9 \\):**  \n   \\[\n   70 \\times 9 = 630, \\quad 810 - 630 = 180\n   \\]  \n   \\( 180 \\) is divisible by 30 (\\( 180 / 30 = 6 \\)), so \\( S = 6 \\).  \n   This is valid, and \\( T = 9 \\) is the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased.\n\n4. **For \\( T = 8 \\):**  \n   \\[\n   70 \\times 8 = 560, \\quad 810 - 560 = 250\n   \\]  \n   \\( 250 \\) is not divisible by 30, so \\( T = 8 \\) is not valid.\n\n5. **For \\( T = 7 \\):**  \n   \\[\n   70 \\times 7 = 490, \\quad 810 - 490 = 320\n   \\]  \n   \\( 320 \\) is not divisible by 30, so \\( T = 7 \\) is not valid.\n\nThus, the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased is \\( T = 9 \\), and the corresponding number of shirts is \\( S = 6 \\). The ratio of trousers to shirts is \\( 9:6 \\), but the question specifically asks for the number of trousers when the maximum number is purchased. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: A**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again. A man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. Each trouser costs 70 rupees and each shirt is 30 rupees. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11. Wait, the options are just the number of trousers, so I need to find out how many trousers he can buy with 810 rupees, and then what the ratio of trousers to shirts is in that scenario.\n\nHmm, so the goal is to maximize the number of trousers. That makes sense. Since each trouser is more expensive than a shirt, buying more trousers would require more money, so to get the maximum number, we probably need to buy as many as possible without exceeding the total budget.\n\nLet me think. Let's denote the number of trousers as t and the number of shirts as s. The total cost is 70t + 30s = 810.\n\nBut since we want to maximize t, I should find the largest integer t such that 70t is less than or equal to 810, and then see how much money is left for shirts.\n\nWait, but maybe after buying t trousers, the remaining money can buy some shirts. So the equation is 70t + 30s = 810. We can rearrange this to find s in terms of t. Let's see:\n\n30s = 810 -70t  \ns = (810 -70t)/30  \ns = (810/30) - (70t)/30  \ns = 27 - (7t)/3.\n\nBut s has to be a whole number because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So (7t)/3 must be an integer subtracted from 27. Wait, but 7t must be divisible by 3 for s to be an integer, right? Because 7t/3 should be an integer.\n\nWait, no, because s has to be an integer, so (810 -70t) must be divisible by 30. Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as 70t must be such that when subtracted from 810, the result is a multiple of 30.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about the equation again. 70t +30s =810. Let's divide the entire equation by 10 to simplify: 7t +3s =81.\n\nSo 7t +3s =81. Now, we need to find integer solutions for t and s where t is as large as possible.\n\nSo, rearranging for s: 3s =81-7t \u2192 s= (81 -7t)/3. For s to be an integer, (81-7t) must be divisible by 3.\n\nWait, 81 is divisible by 3 (because 8+1=9, which is divisible by 3). So 81 mod 3 is 0. 7t mod 3? 7 mod 3 is 1, so 7t mod3 is t mod3. So 81 -7t mod3 is (0 - t mod3) \u2192 which should be 0 for the whole thing to be divisible by 3. So 0 - t mod3 must be 0 \u2192 t mod3 must be 0. So t must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo t can be 3,6,9,12... but given the total amount, what's the maximum t possible?\n\nLet's find the maximum possible t such that 70t \u2264810.\n\nCalculate 810 /70. Let me see: 70*11=770, 70*12=840 which is over 810. So the maximum t can be 11, but wait, does 11 satisfy the condition that (81 -7t) is divisible by 3?\n\nWait, let me check t=11. 7*11=77. 81-77=4. 4 divided by 3 is not an integer. So s would be 4/3, which isn't allowed. So t=11 is not possible.\n\nSo the next possible t is 11-3=8? Because t has to be a multiple of 3. Let me check t=9 first. Wait, t=9: 7*9=63. 81-63=18. 18/3=6. So s=6. That works. So t=9, s=6 is a possible solution.\n\nWait, but wait, 70*9=630. 630 + 30*6=630+180=810. Correct.\n\nBut can we have a higher t? Let's see. What's the next possible t after 9? 12 is too big because 70*12=840>810. So 9 is the maximum t that is a multiple of 3 and allows s to be integer.\n\nWait, but wait another thing: what if t isn't a multiple of 3 but the equation still holds? Because perhaps when t isn't a multiple of 3, (81-7t) is still divisible by 3.\n\nWait, earlier I thought that t has to be a multiple of 3 because 81-7t must be divisible by 3. Let me re-examine that.\n\nWe have 7t +3s=81. For s to be integer, (81-7t) must be divisible by 3. So 81 mod3 is 0, 7t mod3 is (7 mod3)*t mod3 =1*t mod3= t mod3. So 81-7t mod3 is (0 - t mod3) = (-t) mod3.\n\nFor this to be 0, (-t) mod3 must be 0 \u2192 t mod3 must be 0. So t must be a multiple of 3. So only t values that are multiples of 3 are possible.\n\nSo the maximum t possible is 9, because 9 is the largest multiple of 3 that when multiplied by 70 doesn't exceed 810.\n\nWait, wait another moment: 70*9=630, which leaves 810-630=180 for shirts. 180/30=6. So 9 trousers and 6 shirts. The ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question is asking for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the number of trousers is 9, so the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2. But the options don't give ratios, they give the number of trousers. Wait, the options are A)9, B)8, etc. So the correct number of trousers is 9, so the answer is option A.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check if t=8 is possible. Let's plug t=8 into the equation.\n\n70*8=560. So 810-560=250 left for shirts. 250/30=8.333... which is not an integer. So t=8 isn't possible because s would have to be 8.333, which isn't allowed. So t=8 is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, t=10: 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110/30=3.666... again not integer. So t=10 isn't possible.\n\nt=7: 70*7=490. 810-490=320. 320/30=10.666... nope.\n\nt=6: 70*6=420. 810-420=390. 390/30=13. So s=13. So t=6, s=13. But that's less than 9, so since we want maximum t, 9 is better.\n\nSo the correct answer is 9 trousers, which is option A.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says a man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are given as A to E with different numbers of trousers.\n\nHmm, wait. So he's buying both trousers and shirts, right? But we want to maximize the number of trousers. So I guess I need to find how many trousers he can buy with 810 rupees, and then see how many shirts that leaves him with. Then, the ratio would be the number of trousers to shirts.\n\nWait, but maybe the question is a bit different. It says, \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So the ratio would be the number of trousers bought divided by the number of shirts bought.\n\nSo first, let's model the problem. Let me denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S. Each trouser costs 70, so total spent on trousers is 70T. Each shirt is 30, so 30S. The total is 810, so the equation is:\n\n70T + 30S = 810\n\nWe need to maximize T. So T should be as large as possible without making S negative.\n\nWait, but S has to be a whole number, right? Because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt.\n\nSo, rearranging the equation to solve for S:\n\n30S = 810 -70T\n\nS = (810 -70T)/30\n\nWe can simplify that. Let me compute 810 divided by 30 first. 810 /30 is 27. And 70T divided by 30 is (7T)/3.\n\nSo S = 27 - (7T)/3\n\nSince S must be a non-negative integer, (7T)/3 must be an integer, and 27 - (7T)/3 must be \u22650.\n\nSo (7T) must be divisible by 3. Let's think about that. 7 and 3 are coprime, so T must be a multiple of 3 for 7T to be divisible by 3.\n\nSo possible T values are 3,6,9,... but we can't exceed the total amount.\n\nWait, let's find the maximum possible T. The maximum T is when the cost of T is just less than or equal to 810.\n\n70T \u2264 810 \u2192 T \u2264 810/70 \u2192 let me compute that. 70*11=770, 70*12=840 which is more than 810. So T can be up to 11, but wait, 70*11 is 770, which leaves 40 for shirts. But 40 divided by 30 is 1.333... which is not an integer. So that's not allowed.\n\nSo perhaps T has to be less than 11, but also such that (7T) is divisible by 3. Let's see.\n\nLet me list possible T values that are multiples of 3, starting from the maximum possible.\n\nWait, 810 divided by 70 is approximately 11.57, so maximum possible T is 11, but let's check for T=11.\n\nIf T=11, then S=(810 -70*11)/30.\n\n70*11=770, 810-770=40. 40/30 is 4/3, which is about 1.333. Not an integer. So S can't be 1.333, so T=11 is not possible.\n\nSo next, try T=10. Is 10 a multiple of 3? No, 10 divided by 3 is 3.333, which is not an integer. So (7*10)/3 is 70/3, which is about 23.333. But S must be an integer.\n\nWait, but the equation is S=27 - (7T)/3. For T=10, 7*10=70, 70/3 is about 23.333. So 27 -23.333=3.666. Not an integer. So T=10 doesn't work.\n\nNext, T=9. 9 is a multiple of 3. Let's compute S.\n\n70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. So S=6. That's an integer. So T=9, S=6. That's a valid solution.\n\nWait, but could we have a larger T? Because T=9 is a multiple of 3, but what about T=12? 70*12=840 which is more than 810. So that's not possible.\n\nSo the maximum T possible is 9, which gives S=6. So the ratio of T:S is 9:6, which can be simplified to 3:2.

Let me look at the options again:\n\nOptions are A)9 Trousers, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11.\n\nSo the correct number of trousers is 9, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any higher T that could work. For example, T=12 is over, so no. What about T=11? As we saw, it doesn't work. T=10, no. So the next is T=9.\n\nWait, another approach: the total amount is 810. The cost per trouser is 70, shirt 30.\n\nWe can think of it as 70T +30S =810.\n\nWe can divide both sides by 10 to make it simpler: 7T +3S =81.\n\nNow, our equation is 7T +3S=81.\n\nWe need to maximize T, so T should be as large as possible, and S must be an integer \u22650.\n\nSo let's solve for S: 3S =81 -7T \u2192 S=(81-7T)/3.\n\nS must be an integer, so 81 -7T must be divisible by 3.\n\nWhich implies that 7T must be congruent to 81 mod 3.\n\n81 mod3 is 0, so 7T mod3 must also be 0.\n\nBut 7 mod3 is 1 (since 7=3*2+1), so 7T mod3 is (1*T) mod3 = T mod3.\n\nSo T mod3 must be 0. So T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo possible T values are 0,3,6,9,12,... but T can't exceed 810/70=11.57, so up to 11.\n\nSo T can be 9 or 6, etc.\n\nWe need the maximum T, so let's try T=9 first.\n\nAt T=9: 7*9=63. 81-63=18. 18/3=6. So S=6. That works.\n\nT=12 is too much, as 7*12=84>81.\n\nSo T=9 is the maximum possible.\n\nSo the ratio of T:S is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.

      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we start with the equation for the total cost:\n\n\\[\n70T + 30S = 810\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(T\\) is the number of trousers and \\(S\\) is the number of shirts.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says a man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are given as A to E with different numbers of trousers.\n\nHmm, wait. So he's buying both trousers and shirts, right? But we want to maximize the number of trousers. So I guess I need to find how many trousers he can buy with 810 rupees, and then see how many shirts that leaves him with. Then, the ratio would be the number of trousers to shirts.\n\nWait, but maybe the question is a bit different. It says, \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So the ratio would be the number of trousers bought divided by the number of shirts bought.\n\nSo first, let's model the problem. Let me denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S. Each trouser costs 70, so total spent on trousers is 70T. Each shirt is 30, so 30S. The total is 810, so the equation is:\n\n70T + 30S = 810\n\nWe need to maximize T. So T should be as large as possible without making S negative.\n\nWait, but S has to be a whole number, right? Because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt.\n\nSo, rearranging the equation to solve for S:\n\n30S = 810 -70T\n\nS = (810 -70T)/30\n\nWe can simplify that. Let me compute 810 divided by 30 first. 810 /30 is 27. And 70T divided by 30 is (7T)/3.\n\nSo S = 27 - (7T)/3\n\nSince S must be a non-negative integer, (7T)/3 must be an integer, and 27 - (7T)/3 must be \u22650.\n\nSo (7T) must be divisible by 3. Let's think about that. 7 and 3 are coprime, so T must be a multiple of 3 for 7T to be divisible by 3.\n\nSo possible T values are 3,6,9,... but we can't exceed the total amount.\n\nWait, let's find the maximum possible T. The maximum T is when the cost of T is just less than or equal to 810.\n\n70T \u2264 810 \u2192 T \u2264 810/70 \u2192 let me compute that. 70*11=770, 70*12=840 which is more than 810. So T can be up to 11, but wait, 70*11 is 770, which leaves 40 for shirts. But 40 divided by 30 is 1.333... which is not an integer. So that's not allowed.\n\nSo perhaps T has to be less than 11, but also such that (7T) is divisible by 3. Let's see.\n\nLet me list possible T values that are multiples of 3, starting from the maximum possible.\n\nWait, 810 divided by 70 is approximately 11.57, so maximum possible T is 11, but let's check for T=11.\n\nIf T=11, then S=(810 -70*11)/30.\n\n70*11=770, 810-770=40. 40/30 is 4/3, which is about 1.333. Not an integer. So S can't be 1.333, so T=11 is not possible.\n\nSo next, try T=10. Is 10 a multiple of 3? No, 10 divided by 3 is 3.333, which is not an integer. So (7*10)/3 is 70/3, which is about 23.333. But S must be an integer.\n\nWait, but the equation is S=27 - (7T)/3. For T=10, 7*10=70, 70/3 is about 23.333. So 27 -23.333=3.666. Not an integer. So T=10 doesn't work.\n\nNext, T=9. 9 is a multiple of 3. Let's compute S.\n\n70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. So S=6. That's an integer. So T=9, S=6. That's a valid solution.\n\nWait, but could we have a larger T? Because T=9 is a multiple of 3, but what about T=12? 70*12=840 which is more than 810. So that's not possible.\n\nSo the maximum T possible is 9, which gives S=6. So the ratio of T:S is 9:6, which can be simplified to 3:2. But the question is asking for the ratio of trouser to shirt, which is 9/6=3/2, so 3:2.\n\nWait, but the options given are about the number of trousers. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOptions are A)9 Trousers, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11.\n\nSo the correct number of trousers is 9, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any higher T that could work. For example, T=12 is over, so no. What about T=11? As we saw, it doesn't work. T=10, no. So the next is T=9.\n\nWait, another approach: the total amount is 810. The cost per trouser is 70, shirt 30.\n\nWe can think of it as 70T +30S =810.\n\nWe can divide both sides by 10 to make it simpler: 7T +3S =81.\n\nNow, our equation is 7T +3S=81.\n\nWe need to maximize T, so T should be as large as possible, and S must be an integer \u22650.\n\nSo let's solve for S: 3S =81 -7T \u2192 S=(81-7T)/3.\n\nS must be an integer, so 81 -7T must be divisible by 3.\n\nWhich implies that 7T must be congruent to 81 mod 3.\n\n81 mod3 is 0, so 7T mod3 must also be 0.\n\nBut 7 mod3 is 1 (since 7=3*2+1), so 7T mod3 is (1*T) mod3 = T mod3.\n\nSo T mod3 must be 0. So T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo possible T values are 0,3,6,9,12,... but T can't exceed 810/70=11.57, so up to 11.\n\nSo T can be 9 or 6, etc.\n\nWe need the maximum T, so let's try T=9 first.\n\nAt T=9: 7*9=63. 81-63=18. 18/3=6. So S=6. That works.\n\nT=12 is too much, as 7*12=84>81.\n\nSo T=9 is the maximum possible.\n\nSo the ratio of T:S is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question is about the ratio, but the options only give the number of trousers. So the answer is 9, which is option A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start with the equation for the total cost:\n\n\\[\n70T + 30S = 810\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(T\\) is the number of trousers and \\(S\\) is the number of shirts.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where a man spends 810 rupees buying trousers and shirts. Trousers cost 70 each and shirts are 30 each. I need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are A to E, each giving a number of trousers, like 9,8, etc. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nWait, the question is about maximizing the number of trousers. So the man should buy as many trousers as possible within 810 rupees, and then see how many shirts he can buy with the remaining money. Then, the ratio will be based on the maximum number of trousers to the number of shirts.\n\nSo, first, let me calculate how many trousers he can buy. Each trouser is 70 rupees. Let's see, 810 divided by 70. Let me do that division. 70 times 11 is 770, because 70*10 is 700, plus 70 is 770. That leaves 810-770=40 rupees. Wait, but 40 is less than 30? No, 40 is more than 30. Wait, no, 30 is the price of a shirt. So with 40, he can buy one shirt because 30 is less than 40. So then, if he buys 11 trousers, he spends 770, and with 40 left, he can buy 1 shirt. But wait, 40 is more than 30. So yes, 1 shirt. So the ratio would be 11 trousers to 1 shirt, so 11:1. But looking at the options, option E is 11 Trousers, so that's the number. But wait, the question is about the ratio, not the number. Oh, wait no, the options are giving the number of trousers, and the question asks what the ratio is when the maximum number is purchased. So perhaps I need to find the ratio of trouser to shirt count.\n\nWait, wait, the question says \"what will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So, when he buys the maximum number of trousers, how many shirts does he buy, and what is the ratio of trousers to shirts.\n\nSo, let's do the math step by step.\n\nTotal money: 810.\n\nCost per trouser: 70.\n\nCost per shirt: 30.\n\nLet me denote the number of trousers as T, shirts as S.\n\nSo, 70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nWe need to maximize T, so find the maximum integer T such that 70*T \u2264 810.\n\nCompute 810 divided by 70.\n\n70*11 is 770, which is less than 810. 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So maximum T is 11.\n\nSo T=11.\n\nThen, money left: 810 - 70*11 = 810-770=40.\n\nNow, with 40, how many shirts can be bought? Each shirt is 30.\n\n40/30 is 1.333... So maximum 1 shirt. Because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt.\n\nSo S=1.\n\nThus, the ratio of T:S is 11:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, the options are giving the number of trousers, not the ratio. Wait, the question says, \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So the ratio is 11:1, but the options are giving the number of trousers. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options.\n\nWait, the options are A)9, B)8, etc. So each option is the number of trouser. The question is, when maximum number is purchased, what is the ratio of trouser to shirt. So the ratio is 11:1, but the options don't show a ratio. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read again.\n\nThe options are: A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. So perhaps the question is asking for the number of trousers when the maximum is bought, and the ratio is based on that number. Wait, the question says, \"what will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\"\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not about the ratio of counts, but the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts. So the ratio is 11:1, but the options only give the number of trousers, which is 11. So the answer is E) 11 Trousers. But that would just be the number, not the ratio. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the ratio of trouser to shirt, but the options are giving only the number of trousers. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the initial calculation.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the question is about the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts, but the options are giving the number of trousers, and perhaps in the options, the correct ratio corresponds to a certain number of trousers.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's reevaluate.\n\nWe have 70*T +30*S =810.\n\nWe need to maximize T, so T is as large as possible.\n\nWe found T=11, S=1. So the ratio T:S is 11:1.\n\nBut the options are giving the number of trousers. So perhaps the answer is E)11 Trousers. But the question is about the ratio, not the number. Hmm, perhaps the options are incorrect, but that's not the case. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Maybe the ratio is the number of trousers to shirts, but the options are giving the number of trousers in each case, and the correct option's number is the number of trousers when the ratio is as per the question. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is bought, and the options are giving possible numbers of trousers, not the ratio. So for example, if the correct number of trousers is 11, then the ratio is 11:1, but the options only list 11 as E. So the correct answer would be E) 11 Trousers.\n\nBut then the question is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing another constraint.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if 11 is the correct maximum. Let me compute 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40 divided by 30 is 1.333, so only 1 shirt can be bought. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, what if the money is not fully used? Like, 70*11=770, plus 30*1=30. Total 800, which leaves 10 rupees unused. But perhaps that's okay, because the man can't buy a fraction of a shirt.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the money is fully utilized, but that's not possible in this case because 810 isn't a multiple of 70 plus 30*S.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe the problem expects that the man buys some number of trousers and shirts such that the total is 810, and the number of trousers is maximum. So let's try that.\n\nSo, T is as large as possible.\n\nSo, 70*T \u2264810 \u2192 T \u226411.571. So T=11.\n\nThen, 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40 can buy 1 shirt, so S=1. So the ratio is 11:1.\n\nBut the options are about the number of trousers, so the correct option is E) 11 Trousers.\n\nWait, but the question is about the ratio of trouser to shirt. So, perhaps the answer is 11:1, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA)9 Trousers\n\nB)8 Trousers\n\nC)10 Trousers\n\nD)7 Trousers\n\nE)11 Trousers\n\nSo the options are giving the number of trousers. The question is, what is the ratio when maximum number of trousers is purchased. So, the ratio would be 11:1. But the options don't have the ratio. Hmm, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, or I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the number of shirts, but that's not what it says. The question says the ratio of trouser and shirt. So the ratio is 11:1, but the options are about the number of trousers. So perhaps the correct answer is E) 11 Trousers. But that's the number, not the ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are meant to be the ratio, but the way they are written is confusing. For example, option E is 11 Trousers, which would imply that the ratio is 11: something. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts, but the options are giving the number of trousers, and the correct answer is 11, which would imply the ratio is 11:1. So the answer would be E)11 Trousers.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not about the ratio but just the maximum number of trousers, which is 11, so E is the correct option. But the question says ratio of trouser and shirt. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the money is 810, and the maximum number of trousers is 11, with one shirt, so the ratio is 11:1.\n\nBut the options are only giving the number of trousers. So perhaps the intended answer is E)11 Trousers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the ratio of the prices, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of the problem in terms of equations.\n\nWe have 70T +30S =810.\n\nWe need to maximize T, so T is 11, S=1. So the ratio T:S is 11:1.\n\nBut the options are about the number of T, so the correct option is E)11 Trousers.\n\nI think that's the way to go. So the answer is E.\n",

So perhaps I need to find the ratio of trouser to shirt count.\n\nWait, wait, the question says \"what will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So, when he buys the maximum number of trousers, how many shirts does he buy, and what is the ratio of trousers to shirts.\n\nSo, let's do the math step by step.\n\nTotal money: 810.\n\nCost per trouser: 70.\n\nCost per shirt: 30.\n\nLet me denote the number of trousers as T, shirts as S.\n\nSo, 70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nWe need to maximize T, so find the maximum integer T such that 70*T \u2264 810.\n\nCompute 810 divided by 70.\n\n70*11 is 770, which is less than 810. 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So maximum T is 11.\n\nSo T=11.\n\nThen, money left: 810 - 70*11 = 810-770=40.\n\nNow, with 40, how many shirts can be bought? Each shirt is 30.\n\n40/30 is 1.333... So maximum 1 shirt. Because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt.\n\nSo S=1.\n\nThus, the ratio of T:S is 11:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, the options are giving the number of trousers, not the ratio. Wait, the question says, \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So the ratio is 11:1, but the options are giving the number of trousers. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options.\n\nWait, the options are A)9, B)8, etc. So each option is the number of trouser. The question is, when maximum number is purchased, what is the ratio of trouser to shirt. So the ratio is 11:1, but the options don't show a ratio. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read again.\n\nThe options are: A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. So perhaps the question is asking for the number of trousers when the maximum is bought, and the ratio is based on that number. Wait, the question says, \"what will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\"\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not about the ratio of counts, but the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts. So the ratio is 11:1, but the options only give the number of trousers, which is 11. So the answer is E) 11 Trousers. But that would just be the number, not the ratio. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the ratio of trouser to shirt, but the options are giving only the number of trousers. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the initial calculation.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the question is about the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts, but the options are giving the number of trousers, and perhaps in the options, the correct ratio corresponds to a certain number of trousers.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's reevaluate.\n\nWe have 70*T +30*S =810.\n\nWe need to maximize T, so T is as large as possible.\n\nWe found T=11, S=1. So the ratio T:S is 11:1.\n\nBut the options are giving the number of trousers. So perhaps the answer is E)11 Trousers. But the question is about the ratio, not the number. Hmm, perhaps the options are incorrect, but that's not the case. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Maybe the ratio is the number of trousers to shirts, but the options are giving the number of trousers in each case, and the correct option's number is the number of trousers when the ratio is as per the question. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is bought, and the options are giving possible numbers of trousers, not the ratio. So for example, if the correct number of trousers is 11, then the ratio is 11:1, but the options only list 11 as E. So the correct answer would be E) 11 Trousers.\n\nBut then the question is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing another constraint.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if 11 is the correct maximum. Let me compute 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40 divided by 30 is 1.333, so only 1 shirt can be bought. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, what if the money is not fully used? Like, 70*11=770, plus 30*1=30. Total 800, which leaves 10 rupees unused. But perhaps that's okay, because the man can't buy a fraction of a shirt.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the money is fully utilized, but that's not possible in this case because 810 isn't a multiple of 70 plus 30*S.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe the problem expects that the man buys some number of trousers and shirts such that the total is 810, and the number of trousers is maximum. So let's try that.\n\nSo, T is as large as possible.\n\nSo, 70*T \u2264810 \u2192 T \u226411.571. So T=11.\n\nThen, 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40 can buy 1 shirt, so S=1. So the ratio is 11:1.\n\nBut the options are about the number of trousers, so the correct option is E) 11 Trousers.\n\nWait, but the question is about the ratio of trouser to shirt. So, perhaps the answer is 11:1, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA)9 Trousers\n\nB)8 Trousers\n\nC)10 Trousers\n\nD)7 Trousers\n\nE)11 Trousers\n\nSo the options are giving the number of trousers. The question is, what is the ratio when maximum number of trousers is purchased. So, the ratio would be 11:1. But the options don't have the ratio. Hmm, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, or I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the number of shirts, but that's not what it says. The question says the ratio of trouser and shirt. So the ratio is 11:1, but the options are about the number of trousers. So perhaps the correct answer is E) 11 Trousers. But that's the number, not the ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are meant to be the ratio, but the way they are written is confusing. For example, option E is 11 Trousers, which would imply that the ratio is 11: something. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts, but the options are giving the number of trousers, and the correct answer is 11, which would imply the ratio is 11:1. So the answer would be E)11 Trousers.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not about the ratio but just the maximum number of trousers, which is 11, so E is the correct option. But the question says ratio of trouser and shirt. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the money is 810, and the maximum number of trousers is 11, with one shirt, so the ratio is 11:1.\n\nBut the options are only giving the number of trousers. So perhaps the intended answer is E)11 Trousers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the ratio of the prices, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of the problem in terms of equations.\n\nWe have 70T +30S =810.\n\nWe need to maximize T, so T is 11, S=1. So the ratio T:S is 11:1.\n\nBut the options are about the number of T, so the correct option is E)11 Trousers.\n\nI think that's the way to go. So the answer is E.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased, given that the total budget is 810 rupees, each trouser costs 70 rupees, and each shirt costs 30 rupees.\n\n1. **Maximizing the number of trousers**:  \n   The cost of one trouser is 70 rupees. To find the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased, we divide the total budget by the cost per trouser:  \n   \\[\n   T = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{810}{70} \\right\\rfloor = 11\n   \\]  \n   Thus, the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased is 11.\n\n2. **Calculating the remaining budget for shirts**:  \n   The total cost for 11 trousers is:  \n   \\[\n   70 \\times 11 = 770 \\, \\text{rupees}\n   \\]  \n   The remaining budget is:  \n   \\[\n   810 - 770 = 40 \\, \\text{rupees}\n   \\]  \n\n3. **Determining the number of shirts**:  \n   Each shirt costs 30 rupees. With 40 rupees remaining, the maximum number of shirts that can be purchased is:  \n   \\[\n   S = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{30} \\right\\rfloor = 1\n   \\]  \n\n4. **Finding the ratio of trousers to shirts**:  \n   The ratio of trousers to shirts is:  \n   \\[\n   T:S = 11:1\n   \\]  \n\n5. **Interpreting the options**:  \n   The options only provide the number of trousers. Since the maximum number of trousers purchased is 11, the correct answer corresponds to **E) 11 Trousers**.\n\nAnswer: E",

We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers possible. The options are given as A)9, B)8, etc., so I think each option represents the number of trousers he bought.\n\nHmm, wait. The maximum number of trousers. So, he wants to buy as many trousers as possible without exceeding his total budget of 810. But he also buys shirts, so the number of shirts will depend on how much money is left after buying the maximum number of trousers.\n\nLet me think. So, the total amount he can spend is 810. Each trouser is 70, and each shirt is 30. Let me denote the number of trousers as t and shirts as s. So, the equation would be 70t + 30s = 810.\n\nBut we want to maximize t, the number of trousers. So, I should find the maximum possible t such that 70t is less than or equal to 810, and the remaining money is spent on shirts.\n\nWait, but the remaining money after buying t trousers must be divisible by 30 because each shirt costs 30. So, the equation can be rewritten as 30s = 810 -70t. So, (810 -70t) must be divisible by 30, and s must be an integer.\n\nLet me think about how to find t. So, 70t \u2264810. So t \u2264810/70. Let me compute that: 70*11 is 770, which is less than 810. 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So the maximum possible t is 11, but wait, let me check if that leaves a remainder that's divisible by 30.\n\nWait, no, 810 -70*11 = 810 -770 = 40. 40 divided by 30 is 1 and 1/3, which isn't an integer. So s would be 40/30 = 1.333... which isn't possible because you can't buy a third of a shirt. So, t=11 isn't valid.\n\nSo the next lower t is 10. Let me see: 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666... which also isn't an integer. So t=10 isn't valid either.\n\nNext, t=9. 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. So s=6. That works because 6 is an integer. So t=9 and s=6. So the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But wait, the question asks for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. But t=9 is the maximum possible because higher t's don't give integer s. \n\nWait, but let me check t=8. 70*8=560. 810-560=250. 250/30 is approximately 8.333... Not an integer. So no. So t=9 is the maximum possible. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies by dividing both by 3, giving 3:2. So the ratio is 3:2. But the options are giving the number of trousers, not the ratio. Wait, the question says \"what will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So the ratio is 9:6, but perhaps the options are giving the number of trousers, so the answer would be 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is phrased a bit differently. It asks for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So, if he buys 9 trousers and 6 shirts, the ratio is 9:6 or 3:2. But the options are giving the number of trousers, not the ratio. Oh wait, the options are labeled with the number of trousers, like A is 9 Trousers.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: A man spends 810 rupees in buying trousers at Rs 70 each and shirts at 30 each. What will be the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased? The options are given as A to E, each specifying a certain number of trousers.\n\nWait, the question is about finding the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum possible number of trousers. So, the main idea is to maximize the number of trousers he can buy without exceeding his total budget of 810 rupees.\n\nHmm, right. So, let me think about how to approach this. I need to set up an equation based on the given prices and total cost.\n\nLet's denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. Each trouser costs 70 rupees, and each shirt is 30 rupees. So the total cost equation would be:\n\n70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nBut the problem is to maximize T, the number of trousers. So, I need to find the largest possible integer T such that the remaining money can be spent on shirts, which also have to be an integer.\n\nSo, rearranging the equation to solve for S in terms of T might help. Let's see:\n\n30*S = 810 - 70*T  \nS = (810 -70*T)/30.\n\nSince S must be a non-negative integer (you can't buy a negative number of shirts), (810 -70*T) must be divisible by 30 and also result in a non-negative value.\n\nSo, let's compute 810 divided by 30 first. 810 /30 is 27. So the equation becomes S = (27*30 -70*T)/30 = 27 - (70*T)/30. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the equation modulo 30.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to think about the equation 70T +30S=810. Let's divide the entire equation by 10 to simplify:\n\n7T +3S =81.\n\nSo, 7T +3S =81. We need to find integer values of T and S such that T is as large as possible.\n\nOur goal is to maximize T, so let's express S in terms of T:\n\n3S =81 -7T  \nS = (81 -7T)/3.\n\nSince S must be an integer >=0, (81 -7T) must be divisible by 3 and >=0.\n\nLet me think: 81 is a multiple of 3 because 8+1=9, which is divisible by 3. So 81 is divisible by 3. So, 7T must also make (81 -7T) divisible by 3.\n\nWait, 7 mod 3 is 1 because 7 divided by 3 is 2 with remainder 1. So 7T mod 3 is (1*T) mod3. So 81 mod3 is 0. So 0 - (T mod3) must be congruent to 0 mod3. So, T mod3 must be 0.\n\nWhich means T must be a multiple of 3. Because 7T mod3 = T mod3, and 81 mod3 is 0, so 0 - T mod3 must be 0. So T mod3 is 0. So T can be 0,3,6,9, etc.\n\nBut since we need to maximize T, let's try the largest possible T that doesn't make S negative.\n\nSo, the maximum T is when 7T <=81. Let's compute 81 /7. 7*11 is 77, 7*12 is 84 which is over 81. So maximum T could be 11, but we have to check if S is an integer.\n\nWait, but earlier we saw that T must be a multiple of 3. So let's see possible Ts: 0,3,6,9,12. Wait, 12 is beyond 81/7=11.57, so 11 is the maximum without considering the modulo condition. But since T must be a multiple of 3, the possible Ts are 3,6,9.\n\nWait, let me calculate:\n\nAt T=9: 7*9=63. 81-63=18. So 3S=18 \u2192 S=6. That works.\n\nAt T=12: 7*12=84, which is more than 81. So not allowed.\n\nWhat about T=11? 7*11=77. 81-77=4. 4 divided by 3 is 1.333... which isn't an integer. So S would be 1.333, which isn't possible. So T=11 is invalid because S isn't an integer.\n\nSimilarly, T=10: 7*10=70. 81-70=11. 11/3 is 3.666, not integer.\n\nT=9: works, as above.\n\nWait, but wait, could T be higher than 9 but not a multiple of 3?\n\nWait, the earlier condition was that T must be a multiple of 3 because when 7T is subtracted from 81, the result must be divisible by 3. Since 7 mod3 is 1, so 7T mod3 is T mod3. So 81 mod3 is 0, so 0 - T mod3 must be 0 \u2192 T mod3=0. So T must be a multiple of 3. So the maximum possible T is 9, since 12 would be 84, which is over 81.\n\nWait, but wait: 7*9=63 \u2192 81-63=18 \u2192 3S=18 \u2192 S=6. So that works. So T=9, S=6. So the ratio is 9:6 \u2192 simplifies to 3:2.\n\nBut the question is about the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So, the maximum T is 9, and the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2. But the options given are about the number of trousers, not the ratio. Wait, wait, no. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question is: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\"\n\nWait, so the ratio is T:S, which is 9:6, simplifying to 3:2.\n\nBut the options given are all about the number of trousers. The options are A)9, B)8, etc., up to E)11. So perhaps the question is asking for the number of trousers when maximum is bought, which would be 9. So option A is 9.

Are there any other T values higher than 9 that satisfy the conditions?\n\nWait, T=12 is 84, which is more than 81, so no. T=11 gives S=4/3, which is not integer.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: A man spends 810 rupees in buying trousers at Rs 70 each and shirts at 30 each. What will be the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased? The options are given as A to E, each specifying a certain number of trousers.\n\nWait, the question is about finding the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum possible number of trousers. So, the main idea is to maximize the number of trousers he can buy without exceeding his total budget of 810 rupees.\n\nHmm, right. So, let me think about how to approach this. I need to set up an equation based on the given prices and total cost.\n\nLet's denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. Each trouser costs 70 rupees, and each shirt is 30 rupees. So the total cost equation would be:\n\n70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nBut the problem is to maximize T, the number of trousers. So, I need to find the largest possible integer T such that the remaining money can be spent on shirts, which also have to be an integer.\n\nSo, rearranging the equation to solve for S in terms of T might help. Let's see:\n\n30*S = 810 - 70*T  \nS = (810 -70*T)/30.\n\nSince S must be a non-negative integer (you can't buy a negative number of shirts), (810 -70*T) must be divisible by 30 and also result in a non-negative value.\n\nSo, let's compute 810 divided by 30 first. 810 /30 is 27. So the equation becomes S = (27*30 -70*T)/30 = 27 - (70*T)/30. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the equation modulo 30.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to think about the equation 70T +30S=810. Let's divide the entire equation by 10 to simplify:\n\n7T +3S =81.\n\nSo, 7T +3S =81. We need to find integer values of T and S such that T is as large as possible.\n\nOur goal is to maximize T, so let's express S in terms of T:\n\n3S =81 -7T  \nS = (81 -7T)/3.\n\nSince S must be an integer >=0, (81 -7T) must be divisible by 3 and >=0.\n\nLet me think: 81 is a multiple of 3 because 8+1=9, which is divisible by 3. So 81 is divisible by 3. So, 7T must also make (81 -7T) divisible by 3.\n\nWait, 7 mod 3 is 1 because 7 divided by 3 is 2 with remainder 1. So 7T mod 3 is (1*T) mod3. So 81 mod3 is 0. So 0 - (T mod3) must be congruent to 0 mod3. So, T mod3 must be 0.\n\nWhich means T must be a multiple of 3. Because 7T mod3 = T mod3, and 81 mod3 is 0, so 0 - T mod3 must be 0. So T mod3 is 0. So T can be 0,3,6,9, etc.\n\nBut since we need to maximize T, let's try the largest possible T that doesn't make S negative.\n\nSo, the maximum T is when 7T <=81. Let's compute 81 /7. 7*11 is 77, 7*12 is 84 which is over 81. So maximum T could be 11, but we have to check if S is an integer.\n\nWait, but earlier we saw that T must be a multiple of 3. So let's see possible Ts: 0,3,6,9,12. Wait, 12 is beyond 81/7=11.57, so 11 is the maximum without considering the modulo condition. But since T must be a multiple of 3, the possible Ts are 3,6,9.\n\nWait, let me calculate:\n\nAt T=9: 7*9=63. 81-63=18. So 3S=18 \u2192 S=6. That works.\n\nAt T=12: 7*12=84, which is more than 81. So not allowed.\n\nWhat about T=11? 7*11=77. 81-77=4. 4 divided by 3 is 1.333... which isn't an integer. So S would be 1.333, which isn't possible. So T=11 is invalid because S isn't an integer.\n\nSimilarly, T=10: 7*10=70. 81-70=11. 11/3 is 3.666, not integer.\n\nT=9: works, as above.\n\nWait, but wait, could T be higher than 9 but not a multiple of 3?\n\nWait, the earlier condition was that T must be a multiple of 3 because when 7T is subtracted from 81, the result must be divisible by 3. Since 7 mod3 is 1, so 7T mod3 is T mod3. So 81 mod3 is 0, so 0 - T mod3 must be 0 \u2192 T mod3=0. So T must be a multiple of 3. So the maximum possible T is 9, since 12 would be 84, which is over 81.\n\nWait, but wait: 7*9=63 \u2192 81-63=18 \u2192 3S=18 \u2192 S=6. So that works. So T=9, S=6. So the ratio is 9:6 \u2192 simplifies to 3:2.\n\nBut the question is about the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So, the maximum T is 9, and the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So the question is about a man who spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. Trousers cost 70 each and shirts are 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers possible. The options are from A to E, each giving a number of trousers.\n\nHmm, I think the first thing I need to do is set up an equation based on the given information. Let me denote the number of trousers as 't' and the number of shirts as 's'. So each trouser is 70 rupees, so total spent on trousers is 70t. Each shirt is 30, so shirts cost 30s. The total amount is 810, so the equation would be 70t + 30s = 810.\n\nWait, but the question is about the maximum number of trousers. That means we want to maximize 't' while ensuring that 's' is a non-negative integer. Because you can't buy a negative number of shirts, right? So we need to find the maximum 't' such that (810 -70t) is divisible by 30 and also gives a non-negative number of shirts.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation. So 70t + 30s = 810. Let me see, perhaps I can simplify this equation. Both 70 and 30 are divisible by 10, so dividing the entire equation by 10 gives 7t + 3s = 81.\n\nSo 7t + 3s =81. Now, I want to find the maximum 't' possible. So s must be an integer greater than or equal to zero.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Since we're trying to maximize 't', let's find the largest possible 't' such that (81 -7t) is divisible by 3 and also that (81-7t) is non-negative because s can't be negative.\n\nSo let me rearrange for s: 3s =81 -7t \u2192 s=(81-7t)/3.\n\nSo (81 -7t) must be divisible by 3, and also 81 -7t must be \u22650.\n\nLet me think about divisibility by 3. For 7t, since 7 is not a multiple of 3, 7t mod 3 will determine whether 81-7t is divisible by 3. Let's see, 7 mod 3 is 1, so 7t mod3 is equal to (t mod3). Because 7 \u22611 mod3, so 7t \u2261t mod3.\n\nSo 81 is 0 mod3 because 81/3=27, so 81 mod3 is 0. So for (81 -7t) to be divisible by 3, (81 -7t) mod3 must be 0. Since 81 mod3 is 0, (7t mod3) must also be 0. So 7t mod3 is t mod3, which must be 0. So t must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo t must be a multiple of 3. Now, the maximum t possible is when 7t \u226481.\n\nSo let's compute t_max. 7t \u226481 \u2192 t \u226481/7 \u2192 t \u226411.571. So the maximum integer t can be 11. But t must be a multiple of 3, so the possible t values are 0,3,6,9,12... Wait, but 12*7=84>81, so 12 is too big. So the maximum possible multiple of 3 less than or equal to 11 is 9, because 9 is 9, next is 12 which is beyond.\n\nWait, but wait. 11 is not a multiple of 3, but the next lower multiple is 9. So t=9 is a candidate. Let me check t=9.\n\nt=9: 7*9=63. 81-63=18. So s=18/3=6. So s=6. That's possible.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's check t=12. 7*12=84>81. So it's over, so not allowed.\n\nSo the maximum t is 9? But wait, wait a minute. Let me think again. Because perhaps there's a t that's higher than 9 but not a multiple of 3, but still allows s to be an integer.\n\nWait, because the condition is that (81-7t) must be divisible by 3, which requires that 7t \u22610 mod3, which requires t \u22610 mod3. So t must be a multiple of 3. So the maximum t possible is 9, because 12 is too big.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me compute t=9: 7*9=63. 81-63=18. 18/3=6 shirts. That's valid.\n\nWhat about t=11? Let me see. t=11: 7*11=77. 81-77=4. 4/3 is not an integer. So s would be 4/3, which is not allowed because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So t=11 is invalid.\n\nWhat about t=10? 7*10=70. 81-70=11. 11/3 is approximately 3.666, which is not an integer. So s would not be an integer here either.\n\nt=8: 7*8=56. 81-56=25. 25/3 is about 8.333. Not integer.\n\nt=7: 7*7=49. 81-49=32. 32/3 is about 10.666. Not integer.\n\nt=6: 7*6=42. 81-42=39. 39/3=13. So s=13. That's valid, but since t=9 is higher and valid, that's better.\n\nSo the maximum t is 9. So the ratio of trousers to shirts is t:s =9:6. Simplifying that, both are divisible by 3. 9/3=3, 6/3=2. So the ratio is 3:2.\n\nWait, but the question is about the ratio of trouser to shirt. So it's 9:6, which reduces to 3:2.\n\nLooking at the options, the options are about the number of trousers, but the question asks for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, each option gives a number of trousers. So the question is, when he buys the maximum number of trousers, what is the ratio of trousers to shirts.\n\nWait, but the options give the number of trousers, not the ratio. Oh wait, no, the options are A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. So the question is, when he buys the maximum number of trousers, what is the ratio. So the options are the number of trousers, but the question is about the ratio. Hmm, perhaps I misread the question.\n\nWait, the question says: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So the ratio is t:s, but the options give the number of trousers. So perhaps the options are the number of trousers in the ratio, but the answer is to select the correct number, which is part of the ratio.\n\nWait, no, the options are the number of trousers, but the question is about the ratio. So perhaps the options are the possible number of trousers, and the correct answer is the number of trousers which, when the ratio is considered, is part of the ratio.\n\nWait, maybe the question is phrased a bit confusingly. Let me read again.\n\nThe question: What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\n\nSo the ratio is t:s. When maximum t is bought, what is this ratio.\n\nSo for example, if t=9 and s=6, the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nBut looking at the options, they are options A to E with numbers of trousers. So perhaps the question is not about the ratio but the number of trousers when the maximum is bought. So the options are the number of trousers, so the correct answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Because the options are about the number of trousers, but the question asks for the ratio. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, no, the question says: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\"\n\nSo the ratio is t:s. So when he buys the maximum number of trousers, what's the ratio? So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nBut the options don't present the ratio as numbers. They just give the number of trousers. So perhaps the question is actually asking for the number of trousers when the maximum is bought. So in that case, the answer would be 9, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the options are labeled as the number of trousers. So perhaps the question is simply asking for the maximum number of trousers that can be bought, and the answer is 9, option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me go back. The problem is: A man spends 810 on trousers (70 each) and shirts (30 each). Find the ratio of trousers to shirts when maximum number of trousers is bought.\n\nSo the ratio is t:s. We found that t=9 and s=6, so the ratio is 9:6 or 3:2.\n\nBut the options don't give the ratio, they give the number of trousers. So perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, and it's actually asking for the number of trousers when maximum is bought.\n\nIn that case, the answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking back, the options are given as letters with the number of trousers. So perhaps the question is indeed asking for the maximum number of trousers, which is 9, so option A is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to present the ratio as part of the options, but the options only list the number of trousers. So maybe the question is about the number, not the ratio. So I think the correct approach is to find the maximum number of trousers, which is 9, so the answer is A.\n",

For 7t, since 7 is not a multiple of 3, 7t mod 3 will determine whether 81-7t is divisible by 3. Let's see, 7 mod 3 is 1, so 7t mod3 is equal to (t mod3). Because 7 \u22611 mod3, so 7t \u2261t mod3.\n\nSo 81 is 0 mod3 because 81/3=27, so 81 mod3 is 0. So for (81 -7t) to be divisible by 3, (81 -7t) mod3 must be 0. Since 81 mod3 is 0, (7t mod3) must also be 0. So 7t mod3 is t mod3, which must be 0. So t must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo t must be a multiple of 3. Now, the maximum t possible is when 7t \u226481.\n\nSo let's compute t_max. 7t \u226481 \u2192 t \u226481/7 \u2192 t \u226411.571. So the maximum integer t can be 11. But t must be a multiple of 3, so the possible t values are 0,3,6,9,12... Wait, but 12*7=84>81, so 12 is too big. So the maximum possible multiple of 3 less than or equal to 11 is 9, because 9 is 9, next is 12 which is beyond.\n\nWait, but wait. 11 is not a multiple of 3, but the next lower multiple is 9. So t=9 is a candidate. Let me check t=9.\n\nt=9: 7*9=63. 81-63=18. So s=18/3=6. So s=6. That's possible.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's check t=12. 7*12=84>81. So it's over, so not allowed.\n\nSo the maximum t is 9? But wait, wait a minute. Let me think again. Because perhaps there's a t that's higher than 9 but not a multiple of 3, but still allows s to be an integer.\n\nWait, because the condition is that (81-7t) must be divisible by 3, which requires that 7t \u22610 mod3, which requires t \u22610 mod3. So t must be a multiple of 3. So the maximum t possible is 9, because 12 is too big.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me compute t=9: 7*9=63. 81-63=18. 18/3=6 shirts. That's valid.\n\nWhat about t=11? Let me see. t=11: 7*11=77. 81-77=4. 4/3 is not an integer. So s would be 4/3, which is not allowed because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So t=11 is invalid.\n\nWhat about t=10? 7*10=70. 81-70=11. 11/3 is approximately 3.666, which is not an integer. So s would not be an integer here either.\n\nt=8: 7*8=56. 81-56=25. 25/3 is about 8.333. Not integer.\n\nt=7: 7*7=49. 81-49=32. 32/3 is about 10.666. Not integer.\n\nt=6: 7*6=42. 81-42=39. 39/3=13. So s=13. That's valid, but since t=9 is higher and valid, that's better.\n\nSo the maximum t is 9. So the ratio of trousers to shirts is t:s =9:6. Simplifying that, both are divisible by 3. 9/3=3, 6/3=2. So the ratio is 3:2.\n\nWait, but the question is about the ratio of trouser to shirt. So it's 9:6, which reduces to 3:2.\n\nLooking at the options, the options are about the number of trousers, but the question asks for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, each option gives a number of trousers. So the question is, when he buys the maximum number of trousers, what is the ratio of trousers to shirts.\n\nWait, but the options give the number of trousers, not the ratio. Oh wait, no, the options are A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. So the question is, when he buys the maximum number of trousers, what is the ratio. So the options are the number of trousers, but the question is about the ratio. Hmm, perhaps I misread the question.\n\nWait, the question says: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So the ratio is t:s, but the options give the number of trousers. So perhaps the options are the number of trousers in the ratio, but the answer is to select the correct number, which is part of the ratio.\n\nWait, no, the options are the number of trousers, but the question is about the ratio. So perhaps the options are the possible number of trousers, and the correct answer is the number of trousers which, when the ratio is considered, is part of the ratio.\n\nWait, maybe the question is phrased a bit confusingly. Let me read again.\n\nThe question: What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\n\nSo the ratio is t:s. When maximum t is bought, what is this ratio.\n\nSo for example, if t=9 and s=6, the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nBut looking at the options, they are options A to E with numbers of trousers. So perhaps the question is not about the ratio but the number of trousers when the maximum is bought. So the options are the number of trousers, so the correct answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Because the options are about the number of trousers, but the question asks for the ratio. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, no, the question says: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\"\n\nSo the ratio is t:s. So when he buys the maximum number of trousers, what's the ratio? So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nBut the options don't present the ratio as numbers. They just give the number of trousers. So perhaps the question is actually asking for the number of trousers when the maximum is bought. So in that case, the answer would be 9, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the options are labeled as the number of trousers. So perhaps the question is simply asking for the maximum number of trousers that can be bought, and the answer is 9, option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me go back. The problem is: A man spends 810 on trousers (70 each) and shirts (30 each). Find the ratio of trousers to shirts when maximum number of trousers is bought.\n\nSo the ratio is t:s. We found that t=9 and s=6, so the ratio is 9:6 or 3:2.\n\nBut the options don't give the ratio, they give the number of trousers. So perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, and it's actually asking for the number of trousers when maximum is bought.\n\nIn that case, the answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking back, the options are given as letters with the number of trousers. So perhaps the question is indeed asking for the maximum number of trousers, which is 9, so option A is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to present the ratio as part of the options, but the options only list the number of trousers. So maybe the question is about the number, not the ratio. So I think the correct approach is to find the maximum number of trousers, which is 9, so the answer is A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by setting up the equation based on the given information. Let \\( t \\) represent the number of trousers and \\( s \\) represent the number of shirts. Each trouser costs Rs 70, and each shirt costs Rs 30, with a total expenditure of Rs 810. This gives the equation:\n\n\\[\n70t + 30s = 810\n\\]\n\nDividing the entire equation by 10 simplifies it to:\n\n\\[\n7t + 3s = 81\n\\]\n\nThe goal is to maximize \\( t \\) while ensuring \\( s \\) is a non-negative integer. Rearranging for \\( s \\):\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{81 - 7t}{3}\n\\]\n\nFor \\( s \\) to be an integer, \\( 81 - 7t \\) must be divisible by 3. Since \\( 7 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3 \\), \\( 7t \\equiv t \\mod 3 \\). Thus, \\( t \\) must be a multiple of 3 to satisfy the divisibility condition. Additionally, \\( 81 - 7t \\geq 0 \\), so:\n\n\\[\nt \\leq \\frac{81}{7} \\approx 11.57\n\\]\n\nThe largest integer \\( t \\) that is a multiple of 3 and satisfies \\( t \\leq 11.57 \\) is \\( t = 9 \\). Substituting \\( t = 9 \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{81 - 7(9)}{3} = \\frac{81 - 63}{3} = \\frac{18}{3} = 6\n\\]\n\nThus, when \\( t = 9 \\), \\( s = 6 \\), and the ratio of trousers to shirts is \\( 9:6 \\), which simplifies to \\( 3:2 \\). However, the question asks for the maximum number of trousers purchased, not the ratio. Therefore, the correct answer is \\( t = 9 \\), corresponding to option A.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says: A man spends 810 rupees buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. What will be the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased?\n\nHmm, so he's buying both trousers and shirts, and the total he spends is 810 rupees. The goal is to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys as many trousers as possible. Wait, but the options are just giving the number of trousers, not the ratio. Oh wait, maybe the question is asking for the maximum number of trousers he can buy, and then the ratio of trousers to shirts in that scenario. Or perhaps it's about the possible combinations, but the options only give the number of trousers. Wait, looking at the options, each option is just the number of trousers, like 9, 8, etc. So the question is, when he buys the maximum number of trousers possible, how many is that?\n\nWait, the problem says, \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" Oh, wait, maybe the question is phrased a bit differently. So, the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers. So, the maximum number of trousers he can buy without exceeding 810 rupees, and then find the ratio of trousers to shirts in that particular purchase.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio is given, and we need to find the number of trousers. Wait, but the question seems to be about finding the maximum number of trousers, given the total amount. So perhaps it's a problem of maximizing the number of trousers, which are more expensive than shirts, so buying as many as possible, then seeing how many shirts are bought with the remaining money, and then the ratio.\n\nLet me think. So, the man buys T trousers and S shirts. Each trouser costs 70, each shirt 30. Total cost is 70T +30S = 810.\n\nWe need to maximize T, the number of trousers. So, to maximize T, we need to buy as many as possible, which would involve buying the minimum number of shirts possible, or perhaps zero shirts. Wait, but maybe he can't buy zero shirts if the money isn't enough for all trousers. Let me see.\n\nWait, no, the problem says he buys both, so perhaps he buys some of each. Wait, no, maybe not. The problem says \"buying trouser and shirt\"\u2014so maybe he buys at least one of each. Hmm, but the way the problem is phrased, I'm not sure. It's possible that he could buy all trousers and no shirts, but I think the problem expects that he buys some of both. Or maybe not. I'll need to clarify that.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the maximum number of trousers is purchased,\" so perhaps he buys as many as possible, which may leave no money for shirts, but that's possible. Let's check.\n\nSo, the maximum number of trousers he can buy is when the remaining money after buying T trousers is spent on shirts. So, the equation is 70T + 30S = 810.\n\nWe need to find integer values of T and S such that this equation holds, and T is as large as possible.\n\nSo, let me think about how to maximize T. Let's try to find the maximum T where 70T \u2264 810. So 810 divided by 70 is approximately 11.57. So T can be at most 11, since 11*70 is 770, which is less than 810. Then the remaining money is 810 - 770 = 40. But 40 divided by 30 is 1.333, which is not an integer. So S would have to be 1, but that leaves 10 rupees unused, which isn't allowed because the total is 810. So that's not possible.\n\nSo T=11 is not possible because 11*70=770, and 810-770=40, which isn't a multiple of 30. So S can't be a whole number here. So T=11 is invalid.\n\nNext, try T=10. 10*70=700. Remaining is 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666..., which is not an integer. So S=3 would give 90, leaving 20 unused, which isn't allowed. So T=10 also doesn't work.\n\nNext, T=9. 9*70=630. Remaining is 810-630=180. 180 divided by 30 is 6. So S=6. That works. So T=9, S=6. So the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question is about the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So if T=9 is the maximum possible, then the ratio is 9:6 or 3:2.\n\nBut wait, let's check T=8. 8*70=560. Remaining 810-560=250. 250/30 is 8.333. Not integer. So no solution.\n\nT=7: 7*70=490. Remaining 320. 320/30=10.666. Not integer. So no.\n\nWait, but earlier when T=9, it works. So T=9 is possible, but what about higher T?\n\nWait, earlier I thought T=11 didn't work because 11*70=770, leaving 40, which isn't divisible by 30. So 40/30=1.333. So S=1 would leave 10 rupees, which is not allowed. So no solution for T=11.\n\nT=10: 700, 110 left. 110/30=3.666. So S=3, 30*3=90, 20 left. Not allowed. So no.\n\nT=9: 630, 180 left. 180/30=6. So S=6. So that works.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9, with S=6. So the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2.\n\nBut the options are given as A)9, B)8, etc., each being the number of trousers. So the question is asking for the maximum number of trousers purchased, which is 9. So the answer is option A)9 Trousers.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there any possible way to get more than 9 trousers? Because 9*70=630, and 630+6*30=810. That's correct.\n\nBut what if the man buys 10 trousers and then uses the remaining 110 for shirts? But 110 isn't divisible by 30. So that's impossible. So 9 is indeed the maximum number of trousers.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6, which can be simplified to 3:2. But the options only give the number of trousers, so the correct answer is 9, option A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says: A man spends 810 rupees buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. What will be the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased?\n\nHmm, so he's buying both trousers and shirts, and the total he spends is 810 rupees. The goal is to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys as many trousers as possible. Wait, but the options are just giving the number of trousers, not the ratio. Oh wait, maybe the question is asking for the maximum number of trousers he can buy, and then the ratio of trousers to shirts in that scenario. Or perhaps it's about the possible combinations, but the options only give the number of trousers. Wait, looking at the options, each option is just the number of trousers, like 9, 8, etc. So the question is, when he buys the maximum number of trousers possible, how many is that?\n\nWait, the problem says, \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" Oh, wait, maybe the question is phrased a bit differently. So, the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers. So, the maximum number of trousers he can buy without exceeding 810 rupees, and then find the ratio of trousers to shirts in that particular purchase.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio is given, and we need to find the number of trousers. Wait, but the question seems to be about finding the maximum number of trousers, given the total amount. So perhaps it's a problem of maximizing the number of trousers, which are more expensive than shirts, so buying as many as possible, then seeing how many shirts are bought with the remaining money, and then the ratio.\n\nLet me think. So, the man buys T trousers and S shirts. Each trouser costs 70, each shirt 30. Total cost is 70T +30S = 810.\n\nWe need to maximize T, the number of trousers. So, to maximize T, we need to buy as many as possible, which would involve buying the minimum number of shirts possible, or perhaps zero shirts. Wait, but maybe he can't buy zero shirts if the money isn't enough for all trousers. Let me see.\n\nWait, no, the problem says he buys both, so perhaps he buys some of each. Wait, no, maybe not. The problem says \"buying trouser and shirt\"\u2014so maybe he buys at least one of each. Hmm, but the way the problem is phrased, I'm not sure. It's possible that he could buy all trousers and no shirts, but I think the problem expects that he buys some of both. Or maybe not. I'll need to clarify that.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the maximum number of trousers is purchased,\" so perhaps he buys as many as possible, which may leave no money for shirts, but that's possible. Let's check.\n\nSo, the maximum number of trousers he can buy is when the remaining money after buying T trousers is spent on shirts. So, the equation is 70T + 30S = 810.\n\nWe need to find integer values of T and S such that this equation holds, and T is as large as possible.\n\nSo, let me think about how to maximize T. Let's try to find the maximum T where 70T \u2264 810. So 810 divided by 70 is approximately 11.57. So T can be at most 11, since 11*70 is 770, which is less than 810.

So T=11 is invalid.\n\nNext, try T=10. 10*70=700. Remaining is 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666..., which is not an integer. So S=3 would give 90, leaving 20 unused, which isn't allowed. So T=10 also doesn't work.\n\nNext, T=9. 9*70=630. Remaining is 810-630=180. 180 divided by 30 is 6. So S=6. That works. So T=9, S=6. So the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question is about the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So if T=9 is the maximum possible, then the ratio is 9:6 or 3:2.\n\nBut wait, let's check T=8. 8*70=560. Remaining 810-560=250. 250/30 is 8.333. Not integer. So no solution.\n\nT=7: 7*70=490. Remaining 320. 320/30=10.666. Not integer. So no.\n\nWait, but earlier when T=9, it works.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to solve this problem. So, the question is about a man who spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. Each trouser costs 70 rupees, and each shirt costs 30 rupees. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased.\n\nHmm, right. So, the first thing I think is that this is an optimization problem. The man wants to buy as many trousers as possible without exceeding his budget of 810 rupees. Once we find the maximum number of trousers he can buy, we can determine how many shirts he can buy with the remaining money. Then, we can find the ratio of trousers to shirts.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. Each trouser is 70, so the cost for trousers is 70*T. Each shirt is 30, so shirts cost 30*S. The total cost is 70T + 30S = 810.\n\nBut wait, the question says to find the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is bought. That means we need to maximize T, subject to the total cost being exactly 810. Or, if the total can't be exactly 810 after buying maximum T, then perhaps the remaining money is used for shirts. Hmm, but I think the idea is to spend all 810.\n\nWait, but let's think: if he buys maximum possible trousers, then the remaining money goes into shirts. So, we can model this as 70*T + 30*S = 810. But to maximize T, we need to see what's the largest integer T such that 70*T is less than or equal to 810. Then, with the remaining money, see if S can be an integer.\n\nLet me calculate the maximum possible T. So 70*T \u2264 810. Let's divide 810 by 70. 70*11 is 770, which is 770. 770 is less than 810. 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So the maximum T is 11. Wait, but wait, 70*11 is 770, leaving 810-770=40 rupees. Then, shirts are 30 each. Can 40 be divided by 30? 40 divided by 30 is 1 and 10/30, which is 1.333. So S would be 1.333, which isn't an integer. But the number of shirts must be an integer, right?\n\nSo if T is 11, then the remaining money is 40, which isn't enough to buy another shirt. So he can't buy any shirts with that. So S would be zero. But that would mean the ratio is 11:0, which is undefined. But that can't be right because the question says he buys both. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I should think that the total has to be exactly 810, so the remaining money after buying T trousers must be divisible by 30. So, 810 -70T must be divisible by 30. So let's set up the equation: 70T +30S=810. We can simplify this equation.\n\nDivide both sides by 10: 7T +3S =81. So 7T +3S =81.\n\nWe need to find integer solutions for T and S where T is as large as possible.\n\nSo, rearranging: 3S=81-7T \u2192 S=(81-7T)/3. Since S must be an integer, (81-7T) must be divisible by 3. Let's see what T values make 81-7T divisible by 3.\n\nAlternatively, 7T must be congruent to 81 mod 3. Wait, 81 is divisible by 3, so 7T mod 3 must be 0.\n\nBut 7 mod 3 is 1. So 7T mod3 = T mod3. So T must be congruent to 0 mod3. So T has to be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo possible T values are 3,6,9,12, etc. But wait, earlier when T=11, the remaining money wasn't enough for a shirt, but maybe a lower T will allow S to be integer.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought T=11, the remaining was 40, which isn't a multiple of 30. So 70*11=770, 810-770=40. 40 isn't divisible by 30, so S can't be an integer. So T=11 isn't a solution because S would be 40/30=1.333, which isn't allowed.\n\nSo the next possible T that's a multiple of 3 and less than 11 is T=9. Let's check that.\n\nT=9: 70*9=630. Remaining money is 810-630=180. 180 divided by 30 is 6 shirts. So S=6. So the ratio is 9:6, which can be simplified to 3:2.\n\nWait, but is there a higher T that also allows S to be integer? Let's check T=10. Let's see if T=10 works.\n\nT=10: 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666, which isn't integer. So S can't be 3.666. So T=10 is not acceptable.\n\nT=12: 70*12=840, which is more than 810, so that's not allowed.\n\nSo the next possible T is 9, which works. Because when T=9, S=6, which is an integer.\n\nWait, but is there a T higher than 9 that also satisfies the condition? Let's check T=8.\n\nT=8: 70*8=560. Remaining is 810-560=250. 250/30=8.333, not integer. So S=8.333, no.\n\nT=7: 70*7=490. 810-490=320. 320/30=10.666, which isn't integer.\n\nT=10: as before, S=3.666, not integer.\n\nT=11: S=1.333, not integer.\n\nSo the next highest T after 11 that works is 9. So the maximum number of trousers is 9, which allows 6 shirts.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the options are given as the number of trousers, not the ratio. Wait, wait, the question says \"what will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\"\n\nWait, the options are A)9 Trousers, etc. So the options are giving the number of trousers, not the ratio. Wait, the question says: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\"\n\nWait, the options are giving the number of trousers, but the question is about the ratio. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me read the question again.\n\nQuestion: What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\n\nOptions are A)9 Trousers, etc. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the options are just numbers of trousers, not ratios. Oh, perhaps the options are the possible number of trousers, and the ratio is T:S, which we have to find. But the question asks for the ratio, but the options are numbers of trousers. Wait, that's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, the options are probably giving the number of trousers, and perhaps the ratio is between that number and the shirts. But the question is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps the options are the number of trousers, and the question is asking for the number of trousers when maximum is bought, which would be 9. So the correct answer is option A)9 Trousers.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The question says the ratio of trouser to shirt when the maximum number is purchased. So if the maximum number of trousers is 9, and shirts are 6, the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2. But the options don't provide ratios, they give the number of trousers. So perhaps the question is actually asking for the number of trousers, not the ratio. So the maximum number is 9, which is option A.\n\nBut earlier, I thought T=9 gives the maximum number of trousers that allows S to be integer.

Let's divide 810 by 70. 70*11 is 770, which is 770. 770 is less than 810. 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So the maximum T is 11. Wait, but wait, 70*11 is 770, leaving 810-770=40 rupees. Then, shirts are 30 each. Can 40 be divided by 30? 40 divided by 30 is 1 and 10/30, which is 1.333. So S would be 1.333, which isn't an integer. But the number of shirts must be an integer, right?\n\nSo if T is 11, then the remaining money is 40, which isn't enough to buy another shirt. So he can't buy any shirts with that. So S would be zero. But that would mean the ratio is 11:0, which is undefined. But that can't be right because the question says he buys both. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I should think that the total has to be exactly 810, so the remaining money after buying T trousers must be divisible by 30. So, 810 -70T must be divisible by 30. So let's set up the equation: 70T +30S=810. We can simplify this equation.\n\nDivide both sides by 10: 7T +3S =81. So 7T +3S =81.\n\nWe need to find integer solutions for T and S where T is as large as possible.\n\nSo, rearranging: 3S=81-7T \u2192 S=(81-7T)/3. Since S must be an integer, (81-7T) must be divisible by 3. Let's see what T values make 81-7T divisible by 3.\n\nAlternatively, 7T must be congruent to 81 mod 3. Wait, 81 is divisible by 3, so 7T mod 3 must be 0.\n\nBut 7 mod 3 is 1. So 7T mod3 = T mod3. So T must be congruent to 0 mod3. So T has to be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo possible T values are 3,6,9,12, etc. But wait, earlier when T=11, the remaining money wasn't enough for a shirt, but maybe a lower T will allow S to be integer.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought T=11, the remaining was 40, which isn't a multiple of 30. So 70*11=770, 810-770=40. 40 isn't divisible by 30, so S can't be an integer. So T=11 isn't a solution because S would be 40/30=1.333, which isn't allowed.\n\nSo the next possible T that's a multiple of 3 and less than 11 is T=9. Let's check that.\n\nT=9: 70*9=630. Remaining money is 810-630=180. 180 divided by 30 is 6 shirts. So S=6. So the ratio is 9:6, which can be simplified to 3:2.\n\nWait, but is there a higher T that also allows S to be integer? Let's check T=10. Let's see if T=10 works.\n\nT=10: 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666, which isn't integer. So S can't be 3.666. So T=10 is not acceptable.\n\nT=12: 70*12=840, which is more than 810, so that's not allowed.\n\nSo the next possible T is 9, which works. Because when T=9, S=6, which is an integer.\n\nWait, but is there a T higher than 9 that also satisfies the condition? Let's check T=8.\n\nT=8: 70*8=560. Remaining is 810-560=250. 250/30=8.333, not integer. So S=8.333, no.\n\nT=7: 70*7=490. 810-490=320. 320/30=10.666, which isn't integer.\n\nT=10: as before, S=3.666, not integer.\n\nT=11: S=1.333, not integer.\n\nSo the next highest T after 11 that works is 9. So the maximum number of trousers is 9, which allows 6 shirts.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the options are given as the number of trousers, not the ratio. Wait, wait, the question says \"what will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\"\n\nWait, the options are A)9 Trousers, etc. So the options are giving the number of trousers, not the ratio. Wait, the question says: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\"\n\nWait, the options are giving the number of trousers, but the question is about the ratio. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me read the question again.\n\nQuestion: What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\n\nOptions are A)9 Trousers, etc. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the options are just numbers of trousers, not ratios. Oh, perhaps the options are the possible number of trousers, and the ratio is T:S, which we have to find. But the question asks for the ratio, but the options are numbers of trousers. Wait, that's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, the options are probably giving the number of trousers, and perhaps the ratio is between that number and the shirts. But the question is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps the options are the number of trousers, and the question is asking for the number of trousers when maximum is bought, which would be 9. So the correct answer is option A)9 Trousers.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The question says the ratio of trouser to shirt when the maximum number is purchased. So if the maximum number of trousers is 9, and shirts are 6, the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2. But the options don't provide ratios, they give the number of trousers. So perhaps the question is actually asking for the number of trousers, not the ratio. So the maximum number is 9, which is option A.\n\nBut earlier, I thought T=9 gives the maximum number of trousers that allows S to be integer. So the correct answer is 9 trousers, which is option A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of trousers a man can buy with 810 rupees, given that each trouser costs 70 rupees and each shirt costs 30 rupees. The total expenditure is represented by the equation:\n\n\\[\n70T + 30S = 810\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( T \\) is the number of trousers and \\( S \\) is the number of shirts. To maximize \\( T \\), we simplify the equation by dividing through by 10:\n\n\\[\n7T + 3S = 81\n\\]\n\nRearranging for \\( S \\):\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{81 - 7T}{3}\n\\]\n\nFor \\( S \\) to be an integer, \\( 81 - 7T \\) must be divisible by 3. Since \\( 7 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3 \\), \\( T \\) must be a multiple of 3 to satisfy the divisibility condition. Testing possible values of \\( T \\):\n\n- \\( T = 11 \\): \\( 70 \\times 11 = 770 \\), leaving \\( 810 - 770 = 40 \\), which is not divisible by 30. Thus, \\( T = 11 \\) is invalid.\n- \\( T = 10 \\): \\( 70 \\times 10 = 700 \\), leaving \\( 810 - 700 = 110 \\), which is not divisible by 30. Thus, \\( T = 10 \\) is invalid.\n- \\( T = 9 \\): \\( 70 \\times 9 = 630 \\), leaving \\( 810 - 630 = 180 \\), which is divisible by 30. Here, \\( S = 6 \\). This is valid.\n- \\( T = 8 \\): \\( 70 \\times 8 = 560 \\), leaving \\( 810 - 560 = 250 \\), which is not divisible by 30. Thus, \\( T = 8 \\) is invalid.\n- \\( T = 7 \\): \\( 70 \\times 7 = 490 \\), leaving \\( 810 - 490 = 320 \\), which is not divisible by 30. Thus, \\( T = 7 \\) is invalid.\n\nThe highest valid value of \\( T \\) is 9, which allows \\( S = 6 \\). Therefore, the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased is 9.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. \n\nThe question says: A man spends 810 rupees in buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. What will be the ratio of trousers and shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased? The options are A to E, each giving a number of trousers, so I guess the answer will be the option where the maximum number of trousers is possible with 810 rupees.\n\nWait, actually, the question is about finding the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers. Hmm. So, the first thing I think is that he wants to buy as many trousers as possible without exceeding his budget of 810. \n\nSo, each trouser costs 70 rupees, and each shirt is 30. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S. The total cost is 70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nBut since he wants to maximize the number of trousers, he should buy as many as possible, then see how many shirts he can buy with the remaining money. Alternatively, maybe he buys T trousers and S shirts, but we need to find the maximum T possible such that 70*T <= 810, and then S is the remaining money divided by 30.\n\nWait, but the problem says he spends all 810, right? Because it says he spends 810 in buying both. So, the equation is 70T + 30S = 810.\n\nSo, the goal is to find the maximum integer T such that (810 - 70T) is divisible by 30, because the remaining money after buying T trousers must be exactly enough to buy some number of shirts, S, which is an integer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shirts don't have to be bought, but the problem says he buys both, so S must be at least 1? Or maybe S can be zero? Let me check the question again. It says he buys trouser and shirt, so I think he buys at least one of each. So, S has to be at least 1.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So, he might buy as many as possible, even if that leaves no money for shirts. Wait, but if he buys maximum T, then S could be zero. But the question says he buys shirts as well, right? So, he must buy some shirts too. Hmm, perhaps not necessarily. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"A man spend 810 in buying trouser at Rs70 each and shirt at 30 each.\" So, he buys both, so both T and S are at least 1. So, we need to find the maximum T such that 70T +30S =810, with T and S being positive integers.\n\nSo, the approach is to find the maximum T where (810 -70T) is divisible by 30 and S is at least 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to model this with equations.\n\nLet me write the equation:\n\n70T + 30S = 810\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 10 to make it easier:\n\n7T + 3S = 81\n\nNow, we can rearrange for S:\n\n3S = 81 -7T\n=> S = (81 -7T)/3\n\nS must be a positive integer, so (81 -7T) must be divisible by 3 and the result must be positive.\n\nLet me see what 81 minus 7T needs to be.\n\nFirst, 81 mod 3 is 0 because 81 divided by 3 is 27. So 7T must also leave a remainder that when subtracted from 81, the result is divisible by 3.\n\nWait, but 7T mod 3 is equivalent to (7 mod 3) * T mod 3. 7 mod 3 is 1, so 7T mod3 is T mod3.\n\nSo, for 81 -7T to be divisible by 3, 7T mod3 must equal 81 mod3. Since 81 mod3 is 0, 7T mod3 must be 0, which implies T mod3 must be 0. So T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo possible values of T are 3,6,9,12,... but since the maximum T possible is when 70T <=810, let's find that.\n\nMaximum T is floor(810/70). Let's compute 70 * 11 is 770, 70*12=840 which is over 810, so maximum possible T is 11. But wait, 70*11 is 770, which leaves 810-770=40 for shirts. But 40 isn't divisible by 30, so S would be 40/30 which is 1.333, which isn't an integer. So T=11 isn't possible.\n\nSo the next step is to find the largest T (which is a multiple of 3) less than or equal to 11, such that 81 -7T is positive and divisible by 3, and S is a positive integer.\n\nWait, wait, but from our earlier equation, T must be a multiple of 3 for S to be integer. So possible T's are 3,6,9.\n\nWait, but let's test each possible T starting from the maximum possible (11) downwards until we find a T that's a multiple of 3 and for which (81-7T) is positive and divisible by 3, leading to S being a positive integer.\n\nWait, let's approach it step by step.\n\nWe know that T can be up to 11, but the maximum T that is a multiple of 3 and <=11 is 9.\n\nSo let's try T=9.\n\nAt T=9:\n\n7T=63, so 81-63=18. 18/3=6. So S=6.\n\nSo 9 trousers and 6 shirts, which uses 70*9=630 and 30*6=180, totaling 810. So that's a valid solution.\n\nIs there a larger T possible? Let's check T=10. Wait, but T=10 is not a multiple of 3. Let's see.\n\nWait, T=10:\n\n7T=70*10=700, but 700 is 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110/30 is 3.666..., which isn't an integer. So S would be 3.666, which isn't allowed. So T=10 is invalid.\n\nT=11: 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40/30=1.333..., which is not integer. So T=11 invalid.\n\nSo the next possible T is 9, which gives S=6. So that's a valid solution.\n\nWait, but wait, are there any other T's beyond 9 that are multiples of 3 but less than 11? Let's see, T=12 is beyond 11, so no. So the maximum T is 9.\n\nWait, but another approach is to solve 7T +3S=81 for positive integers T and S.\n\nWe can model this as a linear Diophantine equation. The general solution for 7T +3S=81 is:\n\nWe can find one particular solution and then find the general solution.\n\nLet me find a particular solution. Let's try T=9: 7*9=63. 81-63=18, so 3S=18 \u2192 S=6. So (T=9, S=6) is a solution.\n\nThe general solution for the equation 7T +3S =81 can be found by knowing that 7 and 3 are coprime. The solutions will be in the form:\n\nT = T0 + 3k\n\nS = S0 -7k\n\nwhere k is an integer, T0=9, S0=6.\n\nBut since T and S must be positive integers, let's find the values of k that satisfy:\n\nT =9 +3k >0 \u2192 since 9 is positive, any k >=0 would keep T positive, but let's check.\n\nS=6-7k >0 \u2192 6-7k >0 \u2192 7k <6 \u2192 k <6/7 \u2192 k can be 0 or negative integers. But wait, if k is positive, then S becomes negative, which isn't allowed. So k can be 0, -1, -2, etc., but we need T to remain positive.\n\nLet's try k=0: T=9, S=6 \u2192 valid.\n\nk=-1: T=9-3=6, S=6+7=13 \u2192 valid.\n\nk=-2: T=3, S=20 \u2192 valid.\n\nk=-3: T=0, S=27 \u2192 T can't be zero because he must buy at least one trouser.\n\nSo the possible solutions are T=9,6,3, etc.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9, with S=6.\n\nSo the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the maximum T is 9, so the ratio is 9:6, which reduces to 3:2. But the options given are about the number of trousers, not the ratio. Wait, the options are A to E, each giving a number of trousers, like 9,8,10, etc.\n\nWait, the question is phrased a bit confusingly. It says, \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\"\n\nHmm, perhaps I misread the question. Let me re-express it: when he buys the maximum possible number of trousers, what's the ratio of trousers to shirts?\n\nWait, but the options are only giving the number of trousers. Oh wait, looking again, the options are labeled A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. So each option is giving the number of trousers. So perhaps the correct answer is the option where the number of trousers is maximum, which in this case is 9. So the correct option is A)9.\n\nWait, but wait, the options are A)9, B)8, etc., so the answer is A. So the maximum number of trousers is 9, with 6 shirts, ratio 9:6 or 3:2.\n\nSo the answer should be option A)9 Trousers.\n",

Let's try T=9: 7*9=63. 81-63=18, so 3S=18 \u2192 S=6. So (T=9, S=6) is a solution.\n\nThe general solution for the equation 7T +3S =81 can be found by knowing that 7 and 3 are coprime. The solutions will be in the form:\n\nT = T0 + 3k\n\nS = S0 -7k\n\nwhere k is an integer, T0=9, S0=6.\n\nBut since T and S must be positive integers, let's find the values of k that satisfy:\n\nT =9 +3k >0 \u2192 since 9 is positive, any k >=0 would keep T positive, but let's check.\n\nS=6-7k >0 \u2192 6-7k >0 \u2192 7k <6 \u2192 k <6/7 \u2192 k can be 0 or negative integers. But wait, if k is positive, then S becomes negative, which isn't allowed. So k can be 0, -1, -2, etc., but we need T to remain positive.\n\nLet's try k=0: T=9, S=6 \u2192 valid.\n\nk=-1: T=9-3=6, S=6+7=13 \u2192 valid.\n\nk=-2: T=3, S=20 \u2192 valid.\n\nk=-3: T=0, S=27 \u2192 T can't be zero because he must buy at least one trouser.\n\nSo the possible solutions are T=9,6,3, etc.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9, with S=6.\n\nSo the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the maximum T is 9, so the ratio is 9:6, which reduces to 3:2. But the options given are about the number of trousers, not the ratio. Wait, the options are A to E, each giving a number of trousers, like 9,8,10, etc.\n\nWait, the question is phrased a bit confusingly. It says, \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\"\n\nHmm, perhaps I misread the question. Let me re-express it: when he buys the maximum possible number of trousers, what's the ratio of trousers to shirts?\n\nWait, but the options are only giving the number of trousers. Oh wait, looking again, the options are labeled A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. So each option is giving the number of trousers. So perhaps the correct answer is the option where the number of trousers is maximum, which in this case is 9. So the correct option is A)9.\n\nWait, but wait, the options are A)9, B)8, etc., so the answer is A. So the maximum number of trousers is 9, with 6 shirts, ratio 9:6 or 3:2.\n\nSo the answer should be option A)9 Trousers.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start with the equation for the total cost:\n\n\\[\n70T + 30S = 810\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(T\\) is the number of trousers and \\(S\\) is the number of shirts. Simplifying the equation by dividing through by 10 gives:\n\n\\[\n7T + 3S = 81\n\\]\n\nRearranging for \\(S\\):\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{81 - 7T}{3}\n\\]\n\nFor \\(S\\) to be a positive integer, \\((81 - 7T)\\) must be divisible by 3. Since \\(7 \\mod 3 = 1\\), \\(7T \\mod 3 = T \\mod 3\\). Thus, \\(T\\) must be a multiple of 3 for \\((81 - 7T)\\) to be divisible by 3.\n\nThe maximum possible \\(T\\) is determined by the budget constraint \\(70T \\leq 810\\). Dividing \\(810\\) by \\(70\\) gives:\n\n\\[\nT \\leq \\frac{810}{70} \\approx 11.57\n\\]\n\nSo the maximum integer \\(T\\) is 11. However, \\(T = 11\\) is not a multiple of 3. The largest multiple of 3 less than or equal to 11 is \\(T = 9\\).\n\nSubstituting \\(T = 9\\) into the equation:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{81 - 7(9)}{3} = \\frac{81 - 63}{3} = \\frac{18}{3} = 6\n\\]\n\nThus, when \\(T = 9\\), \\(S = 6\\), and the total cost is:\n\n\\[\n70(9) + 30(6) = 630 + 180 = 810\n\\]\n\nThis satisfies the budget constraint. Testing higher values of \\(T\\) (e.g., \\(T = 10\\) or \\(T = 11\\)) shows that they do not result in integer values for \\(S\\). Therefore, the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased is \\(T = 9\\), with \\(S = 6\\).\n\nThe ratio of trousers to shirts is:\n\n\\[\nT:S = 9:6 = 3:2\n\\]\n\nHowever, the question only asks for the number of trousers when the maximum number is purchased. Among the options, the correct answer is:\n\n**A) 9 Trousers**\n\nAnswer: A",

Since each trouser is 70, I'll divide 810 by 70 to see how many he can get.\n\nWait, 70 times what is just under 810. Let me calculate 70 * 11. 70*10 is 700, plus 70 is 770. 70*11=770. 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So he can't buy 12. So the maximum number of trousers is 11? Wait, but wait.

Let me read it again. \n\nThe question says a man spends 810 rupees buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options given are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11. Wait, actually, the options are labeled A to E, each with a number followed by 'Trousers', so I think the options are indicating the number of trousers purchased, and we need to find which option gives the maximum number of trousers possible, and then the ratio based on that.\n\nHmm, let me rephrase the problem. He's buying two items: trousers and shirts. Each trouser costs 70 Rs, each shirt 30 Rs. Total amount he spends is 810 Rs. We need to find the maximum number of trousers he can buy, and then find the ratio of trousers to shirts in that scenario.\n\nSo, the goal is to maximize the number of trousers. To do that, he should spend as much as possible on trousers and the rest on shirts. Because each trouser is more expensive, buying more of them would mean spending more on each, but since we want maximum count, perhaps that's not the right approach. Wait, no, wait. Wait a second. No, wait, no, wait. No, wait, no, no. Wait, no. Because if each trouser is more expensive, to get more trousers, you need to spend more money per trouser. Oh, but the total amount is fixed. So, to maximize the number of trousers, we need to find how many as possible, given that each is 70.\n\nWait, perhaps I should set up an equation. Let me denote the number of trousers as t and shirts as s. So, the total cost would be 70t + 30s = 810. And we need to find the maximum possible t, such that s is a non-negative integer (since you can't buy a negative number of shirts).\n\nSo, to maximize t, we need to find the maximum t where 70t \u2264 810, and the remaining money (810 -70t) must be divisible by 30, because that's the price per shirt.\n\nWait, not necessarily divisible. Because the remaining amount after buying t trousers must be equal to 30*s, where s is an integer \u22650. So, 810 -70t must be a multiple of 30, and non-negative.\n\nSo, let's find t such that 810 -70t is divisible by 30, and 70t \u2264810.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum possible t without considering the divisibility. 810 /70 is approximately 11.57. So, the maximum integer t would be 11. Let's check if 810 -70*11 is divisible by 30.\n\n70*11 is 770. 810-770=40. Is 40 divisible by 30? No, because 40/30 is 1.333..., which is not an integer. So, t=11 is not possible because the remaining 40 can't be spent on shirts at 30 each. So, we have to try t=10.\n\n70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666..., which is not an integer. So, t=10 doesn't work either. Next, t=9.\n\n70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180 divided by 30 is 6. So, s=6. That's valid. So, t=9, s=6. So, the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but wait. The question is asking for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So, is t=9 the maximum possible? Let's check t=8.\n\n70*8=560. 810-560=250. 250 divided by 30 is 8.333... Not an integer. So, that's not acceptable.\n\nt=7: 70*7=490. 810-490=320. 320/30=10.666... Not an integer.\n\nt=6: 70*6=420. 810-420=390. 390/30=13. That's an integer. So, t=6, s=13. But 6 is less than 9, so t=9 is a higher number.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I should check higher t's. Because t=11 didn't work, but what about t=10? As above, t=10 gives 110, which is not divisible by 30. So, moving down, t=9 works.\n\nWait, but what about t=10, maybe I made a mistake. 70*10=700, 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3 with a remainder of 20. So no, that's not possible. So, t=9 is the maximum.\n\nSo, the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nBut wait, the options are giving the number of trousers as options. The options are A)9, B)8, etc. So, the answer is option A)9. But the question is about the ratio, but the options are only giving the number of trousers. Wait, no, let me read the question again.\n\nWait, the question says: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\"\n\nWait, the ratio is of the number of trousers to shirts. So, when he buys 9 trousers, he buys 6 shirts. So the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2. But the options don't give a ratio; the options are all numbers of trousers, like A)9, etc. Wait, perhaps I misread the options.\n\nWait, looking back, the options are:\n\nA)9 Trousers\n\nB)8 Trousers\n\nC)10 Trousers\n\nD)7 Trousers\n\nE)11 Trousers\n\nSo, each option is a possible number of trousers. So, the question is, which option represents the maximum number of trousers possible? So, the correct option is A)9.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. \n\nThe question says a man spends 810 rupees buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options given are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11. Wait, actually, the options are labeled A to E, each with a number followed by 'Trousers', so I think the options are indicating the number of trousers purchased, and we need to find which option gives the maximum number of trousers possible, and then the ratio based on that.\n\nHmm, let me rephrase the problem. He's buying two items: trousers and shirts. Each trouser costs 70 Rs, each shirt 30 Rs. Total amount he spends is 810 Rs. We need to find the maximum number of trousers he can buy, and then find the ratio of trousers to shirts in that scenario.\n\nSo, the goal is to maximize the number of trousers. To do that, he should spend as much as possible on trousers and the rest on shirts. Because each trouser is more expensive, buying more of them would mean spending more on each, but since we want maximum count, perhaps that's not the right approach. Wait, no, wait. Wait a second. No, wait, no, wait. No, wait, no, no. Wait, no. Because if each trouser is more expensive, to get more trousers, you need to spend more money per trouser. Oh, but the total amount is fixed. So, to maximize the number of trousers, we need to find how many as possible, given that each is 70.\n\nWait, perhaps I should set up an equation. Let me denote the number of trousers as t and shirts as s. So, the total cost would be 70t + 30s = 810. And we need to find the maximum possible t, such that s is a non-negative integer (since you can't buy a negative number of shirts).\n\nSo, to maximize t, we need to find the maximum t where 70t \u2264 810, and the remaining money (810 -70t) must be divisible by 30, because that's the price per shirt.\n\nWait, not necessarily divisible. Because the remaining amount after buying t trousers must be equal to 30*s, where s is an integer \u22650. So, 810 -70t must be a multiple of 30, and non-negative.\n\nSo, let's find t such that 810 -70t is divisible by 30, and 70t \u2264810.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum possible t without considering the divisibility. 810 /70 is approximately 11.57. So, the maximum integer t would be 11. Let's check if 810 -70*11 is divisible by 30.\n\n70*11 is 770. 810-770=40. Is 40 divisible by 30? No, because 40/30 is 1.333..., which is not an integer. So, t=11 is not possible because the remaining 40 can't be spent on shirts at 30 each. So, we have to try t=10.\n\n70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666..., which is not an integer. So, t=10 doesn't work either. Next, t=9.\n\n70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180 divided by 30 is 6. So, s=6. That's valid. So, t=9, s=6. So, the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but wait. The question is asking for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So, is t=9 the maximum possible? Let's check t=8.\n\n70*8=560. 810-560=250. 250 divided by 30 is 8.333... Not an integer. So, that's not acceptable.\n\nt=7: 70*7=490. 810-490=320. 320/30=10.666... Not an integer.\n\nt=6: 70*6=420. 810-420=390. 390/30=13. That's an integer. So, t=6, s=13. But 6 is less than 9, so t=9 is a higher number.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I should check higher t's. Because t=11 didn't work, but what about t=10? As above, t=10 gives 110, which is not divisible by 30. So, moving down, t=9 works.\n\nWait, but what about t=10, maybe I made a mistake. 70*10=700, 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3 with a remainder of 20. So no, that's not possible. So, t=9 is the maximum.\n\nSo, the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nBut wait, the options are giving the number of trousers as options. The options are A)9, B)8, etc. So, the answer is option A)9. But the question is about the ratio, but the options are only giving the number of trousers. Wait, no, let me read the question again.\n\nWait, the question says: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\"\n\nWait, the ratio is of the number of trousers to shirts. So, when he buys 9 trousers, he buys 6 shirts. So the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2. But the options don't give a ratio; the options are all numbers of trousers, like A)9, etc. Wait, perhaps I misread the options.\n\nWait, looking back, the options are:\n\nA)9 Trousers\n\nB)8 Trousers\n\nC)10 Trousers\n\nD)7 Trousers\n\nE)11 Trousers\n\nSo, each option is a possible number of trousers. So, the question is, which option represents the maximum number of trousers possible? So, the correct option is A)9. Because when he buys 9 trousers, he can buy 6 shirts, and that's the maximum number of trousers possible without exceeding the budget.\n\nSo, the answer is option A)9.\n\n\nTo determine the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased with 810 Rs, given that each trouser costs 70 Rs and each shirt costs 30 Rs, we set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n70t + 30s = 810\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( t \\) is the number of trousers and \\( s \\) is the number of shirts.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again. A man spends 810 rupees buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are A to E, each giving a number of trousers.\n\nHmm, so the goal is to maximize the number of trousers, right? So he should buy as many trousers as possible without exceeding his total budget of 810 rupees. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nLet me denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S. The total cost is 70*T + 30*S = 810. I need to maximize T, so I should spend as much as possible on trousers, and then see how many shirts I can buy with the remaining money.\n\nWait, but the problem says the ratio of trousers to shirts when maximum number of trousers is bought. So first, find the maximum T possible.\n\nSo, 70*T <= 810. Let me calculate how many T he can buy.\n\n810 divided by 70. Let's see, 70 * 11 is 770, because 70*10 is 700, plus 70 is 770. 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So maximum T is 11, but wait, let me check.\n\nWait, 70*11=770. That leaves 810-770=40 rupees. Now, can he buy shirts with 40? Each shirt is 30. So 40 /30 is 1.333, so he can buy 1 shirt, and have 10 rupees left, which isn't enough for another shirt. So with 11 trousers, he can buy 1 shirt. But wait, is 11 an option? Let me look at the options.\n\nOptions are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11. So E is 11. But wait, let me make sure that 11 is actually possible. Because 70*11 is 770, which is under 810. 770 +30*1=770+30=800, which is under 810. So yes, 11 trousers and 1 shirt would cost 800, leaving 10. But that's okay, he doesn't have to spend all the money, right? The problem says he spends 810. Wait, no, wait. The problem says he spends 810 in buying. So he must spend exactly 810.\n\nOh, wait, that's an important point. So 70T +30S must equal exactly 810. So 70T +30S=810.\n\nSo, if I'm trying to maximize T, I need to find the largest T such that (810 -70T) is divisible by 30, because S must be an integer.\n\nLet me think about that. 70T must be such that 810-70T is a multiple of 30.\n\nLet me rewrite the equation:\n\n70T +30S =810\n\nDivide both sides by 10 to simplify:\n\n7T +3S =81\n\nSo 7T +3S =81.\n\nWe need T and S to be non-negative integers.\n\nOur goal is to maximize T.\n\nSo, let me express S in terms of T.\n\n3S = 81 -7T\n\nS = (81 -7T)/3\n\nS must be an integer, so (81 -7T) must be divisible by 3.\n\nSo 81 mod 3 is 0, because 8+1=9, which is divisible by 3. So 7T must also leave a remainder of 0 when subtracted from 81. Wait, 81 -7T must be divisible by 3.\n\nLet me see, 7 mod 3 is 1. Because 7 divided by 3 is 2 with a remainder of 1.\n\nSo 7T mod3 = (7 mod3) * (T mod3) )= (1 * T mod3) )= T mod3.\n\nSo 81 mod3 is 0, so 0 - (T mod3) must be 0 mod3.\n\nSo 0 - (T mod3) \u22610 mod3 \u2192 T mod3 \u22610.\n\nSo T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo possible T values are 0,3,6,9,12,... but since 70*T <=810, T_max is 11 (since 70*11=770, 70*12=840>810). So T can be up to 11, but T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo possible T: 0,3,6,9,12. But 12 is too high, so max is 9.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought T could be 11, but that's not a multiple of 3. So perhaps I was wrong earlier.\n\nWait, because 70*T must be such that 810-70T is divisible by 30. So when T is 11, 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40 is not divisible by 30, so S would be 40/30=1.333, which isn't an integer. So that's invalid. So T can't be 11.\n\nWait, but wait, in the equation 7T +3S=81, for T=11, 7*11=77. 81-77=4. 4/3 is 1.333, so S is not integer. So T=11 isn't allowed.\n\nSo the maximum T is the largest multiple of 3 that's less than or equal to 11.\n\nSo the multiples of 3 below 12 are 0,3,6,9,12. So the largest T is 9.\n\nWait, but wait, 9 is a multiple of 3, but is there a higher T that isn't a multiple of 3 but still makes 81-7T divisible by 3? Because earlier reasoning said T must be a multiple of 3, but perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the condition. 7T +3S=81.\n\nWe can think of 7T \u2261 81 mod3.\n\nBut 81 mod3 is 0. So 7T mod3 must be 0.\n\nSince 7 mod3 is 1, 7T mod3 is (1*T) mod3 \u2192 T mod3 must be 0.\n\nSo T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo the maximum T possible is 9, because 9 is a multiple of 3, and 9*70=630. Then 810-630=180. 180 divided by 30 is 6. So S=6.\n\nSo the ratio of T:S would be 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question is asking for the ratio when maximum number of trousers is purchased, which is 9. So the answer is option A)9.\n\nWait, but let me check if T=9 is the maximum possible. Is there a T higher than 9, say 10, that works?\n\nLet's try T=10.\n\n7*10=70. 81-70=11. 11 divided by3 is 3.666, which isn't an integer. So S=3.666, which is invalid. So T=10 is not allowed.\n\nWhat about T=12? 12 is higher than 9 but 70*12=840 which is more than 810. So no, that's too much.\n\nWhat about T=8?\n\nT=8 is not a multiple of 3. 7*8=56. 81-56=25. 25/3=8.333, not integer. So no.\n\nSo the maximum possible T is 9, which gives S=6. So the ratio is 9:6 = 3:2.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So it's the ratio of T:S. So 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the options are just the number of trousers, not the ratio itself. Wait, no, looking at the options, each option is the number of trousers, but the question says, \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" Hmm, wait, the question is a bit unclear. Let me read it again.\n\nThe exact question is: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So the ratio of T:S when T is maximum.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But looking at the options, the options are the number of T, not the ratio. So perhaps the options are about the number of T, not the ratio. Wait, no, the question is about the ratio, but the options are numbers of T. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, looking back at the options:\n\nOptions are:\nA)9 Trousers\nB)8 Trousers\nC)10 Trousers\nD)7 Trousers\nE)11 Trousers\n\nWait, but the question is about the ratio, not the number of trousers. So perhaps the options are the number of T, but the question is asking for the ratio, which would be something like 3:2, but that's not any of the options. So perhaps I've misread the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is actually asking for the number of trousers when maximum number is bought, which would be 9. So the answer is option A)9.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought T=11 was possible, but that didn't satisfy the condition of S being integer.

So T can't be 11.\n\nWait, but wait, in the equation 7T +3S=81, for T=11, 7*11=77. 81-77=4. 4/3 is 1.333, so S is not integer. So T=11 isn't allowed.\n\nSo the maximum T is the largest multiple of 3 that's less than or equal to 11.\n\nSo the multiples of 3 below 12 are 0,3,6,9,12. So the largest T is 9.\n\nWait, but wait, 9 is a multiple of 3, but is there a higher T that isn't a multiple of 3 but still makes 81-7T divisible by 3? Because earlier reasoning said T must be a multiple of 3, but perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the condition. 7T +3S=81.\n\nWe can think of 7T \u2261 81 mod3.\n\nBut 81 mod3 is 0. So 7T mod3 must be 0.\n\nSince 7 mod3 is 1, 7T mod3 is (1*T) mod3 \u2192 T mod3 must be 0.\n\nSo T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo the maximum T possible is 9, because 9 is a multiple of 3, and 9*70=630. Then 810-630=180. 180 divided by 30 is 6. So S=6.\n\nSo the ratio of T:S would be 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question is asking for the ratio when maximum number of trousers is purchased, which is 9. So the answer is option A)9.\n\nWait, but let me check if T=9 is the maximum possible. Is there a T higher than 9, say 10, that works?\n\nLet's try T=10.\n\n7*10=70. 81-70=11. 11 divided by3 is 3.666, which isn't an integer. So S=3.666, which is invalid. So T=10 is not allowed.\n\nWhat about T=12? 12 is higher than 9 but 70*12=840 which is more than 810. So no, that's too much.\n\nWhat about T=8?\n\nT=8 is not a multiple of 3. 7*8=56. 81-56=25. 25/3=8.333, not integer. So no.\n\nSo the maximum possible T is 9, which gives S=6. So the ratio is 9:6 = 3:2.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So it's the ratio of T:S. So 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the options are just the number of trousers, not the ratio itself. Wait, no, looking at the options, each option is the number of trousers, but the question says, \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" Hmm, wait, the question is a bit unclear. Let me read it again.\n\nThe exact question is: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So the ratio of T:S when T is maximum.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But looking at the options, the options are the number of T, not the ratio. So perhaps the options are about the number of T, not the ratio. Wait, no, the question is about the ratio, but the options are numbers of T. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, looking back at the options:\n\nOptions are:\nA)9 Trousers\nB)8 Trousers\nC)10 Trousers\nD)7 Trousers\nE)11 Trousers\n\nWait, but the question is about the ratio, not the number of trousers. So perhaps the options are the number of T, but the question is asking for the ratio, which would be something like 3:2, but that's not any of the options. So perhaps I've misread the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is actually asking for the number of trousers when maximum number is bought, which would be 9. So the answer is option A)9.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought T=11 was possible, but that didn't satisfy the condition of S being integer. So the maximum T is 9.\n\nSo the answer is 9, which is option A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of trousers (T) that can be purchased with a total budget of 810 rupees, given that each trouser costs 70 rupees and each shirt costs 30 rupees. The equation governing the total cost is:\n\n\\[\n70T + 30S = 810\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(T\\) is the number of trousers and \\(S\\) is the number of shirts. Dividing the entire equation by 10 simplifies it to:\n\n\\[\n7T + 3S = 81\n\\]\n\nRearranging for \\(S\\):\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{81 - 7T}{3}\n\\]\n\nFor \\(S\\) to be an integer, \\((81 - 7T)\\) must be divisible by 3. Since \\(7 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3\\), \\(7T \\equiv T \\mod 3\\). Thus, \\(T\\) must be a multiple of 3 to satisfy the condition \\(T \\equiv 0 \\mod 3\\).\n\nThe possible values of \\(T\\) are 0, 3, 6, 9, etc. However, the budget constraint \\(70T \\leq 810\\) limits \\(T\\) to a maximum of 11. Among these, the largest multiple of 3 less than or equal to 11 is \\(T = 9\\).\n\nSubstituting \\(T = 9\\) into the equation:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{81 - 7(9)}{3} = \\frac{81 - 63}{3} = \\frac{18}{3} = 6\n\\]\n\nThus, with \\(T = 9\\), \\(S = 6\\), and the total cost is \\(70(9) + 30(6) = 630 + 180 = 810\\), which matches the budget. Therefore, the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased is 9.\n\nThe ratio of trousers to shirts is \\(9:6\\), which simplifies to \\(3:2\\). However, the question asks for the number of trousers when the maximum number is purchased, which is 9.\n\nAnswer: A",

Trousers cost 70 rupees each, shirts are 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers possible. The options are A to E, each giving a number of trousers.\n\nHmm. So the goal is to maximize the number of trousers he can buy without exceeding his total budget. Then, once we find that maximum number, we can find out how many shirts he bought, and then determine the ratio.\n\nWait, the question says \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So ratio is number of trousers to number of shirts.\n\nRight, so first, let's model this with equations. Let me denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S.\n\nThe cost equation would be 70*T + 30*S = 810. Because each trouser is 70, each shirt 30, and total is 810.\n\nWe need to maximize T. So we can express S in terms of T, or vice versa. Let me try to express S in terms of T.\n\nFrom 70T + 30S = 810, subtract 70T from both sides: 30S = 810 -70T. Then divide both sides by 30: S = (810 -70T)/30.\n\nSimplify that: Let's see, 810 divided by 30 is 27. 70T divided by 30 is (7T)/3. So S = 27 - (7T)/3.\n\nBut since S has to be a whole number (you can't buy a fraction of a shirt), (7T)/3 must be an integer because 27 is an integer. So (7T) must be divisible by 3. Let's think about that.\n\nWait, 7 and 3 are coprime (no common factors besides 1), so T must be a multiple of 3. Because 7T mod 3 should be 0. 7 mod 3 is 1, so T mod 3 should be 0. So T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo possible T values are 0,3,6,9, etc., but T can't be more than 810/70, which is about 11.57. So the maximum T possible is 11, but wait, T has to be a multiple of 3. So possible Ts are 0,3,6,9,12. Wait, 12*70 is 840 which is more than 810. So maximum possible T is 11? Wait no, because T must be a multiple of 3. So the next lower multiple is 9.\n\nWait, 9*70 is 630. Let's check that. 9*70=630. So 810-630=180. 180 divided by 30 is 6. So S=6. So that works. T=9, S=6.\n\nWait, but is 11 a possible T? Let's see. 11*70=770. Then 810-770=40. 40 divided by 30 is 1.333..., which is not an integer. So S would be 1.333, which isn't possible because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So T=11 isn't possible. Similarly, T=10: 10*70=700. 810-700=110. 110/30 is 3.666..., again not an integer.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought T must be a multiple of 3. Because (7T) must be divisible by 3. So T must be a multiple of 3. So let's check all Ts that are multiples of 3 up to the maximum possible.\n\nMaximum T is when 70*T <=810. So T_max = floor(810/70). 70*11=770, 70*12=840>810. So T_max possible is 11, but T must be a multiple of 3. So the highest possible T is 9.\n\nWait, 9*70=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6 shirts. So that's a valid solution. What about T=6? 6*70=420. 810-420=390. 390/30=13 shirts. So that's another solution, but with fewer trousers. We want the maximum T, which is 9.\n\nSo the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6. Simplify that by dividing both by 3: 3:2.\n\nWait, but the options are about the number of trousers, not the ratio. Wait, the question is asking what will be the ratio of trousers and shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but the options given are all numbers of trousers. The options are A)9, B)8, etc. So perhaps the question is phrased in a confusing way.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe problem says: A man spends 810 rupees buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. What will be the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased?\n\nThe options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11, each representing the number of trousers.\n\nHmm, wait. The question is about the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So, I think I need to find how many trousers and shirts he can buy with 810 rupees such that the number of trousers is as high as possible, and then find the ratio of those two numbers.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. Each trouser costs 70 rupees, and each shirt is 30. So the total cost equation would be:\n\n70*T + 30*S = 810\n\nWe need to maximize T, which means we need to find the largest integer T such that (810 - 70*T) is divisible by 30, and the remaining money can buy some shirts.\n\nWait, no. Because the remaining money after buying T trousers should be exactly divisible by the shirt's cost, which is 30. So, (810 - 70*T) must be divisible by 30, and the result should be the number of shirts S, which must be a non-negative integer.\n\nAlternatively, since 70 and 30 have a common factor of 10, maybe I can simplify the equation. Let's divide the entire equation by 10 to make it easier:\n\n7T + 3S = 81\n\nNow, the problem is to find the maximum integer T such that 81 -7T is non-negative and divisible by 3.\n\nBecause 3S must equal 81 -7T, so 81-7T must be >=0 and also must be divisible by 3.\n\nWait, 7T must be <=81. So T can be at most 11, since 7*11=77, which is less than 81. 7*12=84 which is more than 81, so T can't be 12. So the maximum possible T is 11. But wait, let's check if 81 -7*11 is divisible by 3.\n\n7*11=77. 81-77=4. 4 divided by 3 is 1.333..., which is not an integer. So S would not be an integer. That's a problem. So T=11 isn't possible because it doesn't result in an integer number of shirts.\n\nSo we need to go down to T=10. Let's check:\n\n7*10=70. 81-70=11. 11 divided by 3 is approximately 3.666..., which isn't an integer either. So T=10 isn't possible either.\n\nHmm, next is T=9.\n\n7*9=63. 81-63=18. 18 divided by 3 is 6. That's an integer. So S=6. So when T=9, S=6. That works.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I should check all Ts from 11 downwards until I find one that gives S as an integer. Because perhaps T=8 is possible, but maybe a higher T than 9 is possible? Let's see.\n\nWait, I thought T=11 and 10 didn't work.

But the question is asking for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So the maximum T is 9, which gives S=6. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts, so 9:6, which is 3:2. But the options given are the number of trousers, not the ratio. Wait, the question says \"what will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\"\n\nWait, the question is phrased a bit confusingly. Oh, wait, no. The options are A)9 Trousers, etc. So perhaps the question is asking for the number of trousers, not the ratio itself. Because the options are all numbers of trousers.\n\nWait, that's a different approach. So perhaps the question is just asking, when you buy as many trousers as possible, how many do you get? Then the ratio is T:S, but the options are giving the number of trousers, so maybe the answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think again.\n\nWe have to find the maximum T such that 70T +30S=810, with S being an integer.\n\nSimplify the equation: 7T +3S=81.\n\nSo, for each T, check if (81 -7T) is divisible by 3.\n\nSo T can be from 0 up to 11, as 7*11=77 <81, 7*12=84>81.\n\nWe need to find the maximum T where (81-7T) is divisible by 3.\n\nSo let's check T=11: 81-77=4 \u2192 4 mod3=1 \u2192 Not divisible.\n\nT=10: 81-70=11 \u2192 11 mod3= 2 \u2192 Not divisible.\n\nT=9: 81-63=18 \u2192 18 mod3=0 \u2192 Yes. So S=6.\n\nSo T=9 is possible. So the maximum number of trousers is 9.\n\nSo the answer should be A)9 Trousers.\n\nWait, but let me check T=8: 81-56=25 \u2192 25 mod3=1 \u2192 Not divisible.\n\nT=7: 81-49=32 \u2192 32 mod3= 2 \u2192 Not.\n\nT=6: 81-42=39 \u2192 39/3=13 \u2192 So S=13. But T=6 is less than 9, so 9 is the maximum.\n\nYes, so the correct answer is 9 trousers, option A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe problem says: A man spends 810 rupees buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. What will be the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased?\n\nThe options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11, each representing the number of trousers.\n\nHmm, wait. The question is about the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So, I think I need to find how many trousers and shirts he can buy with 810 rupees such that the number of trousers is as high as possible, and then find the ratio of those two numbers.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. Each trouser costs 70 rupees, and each shirt is 30. So the total cost equation would be:\n\n70*T + 30*S = 810\n\nWe need to maximize T, which means we need to find the largest integer T such that (810 - 70*T) is divisible by 30, and the remaining money can buy some shirts.\n\nWait, no. Because the remaining money after buying T trousers should be exactly divisible by the shirt's cost, which is 30. So, (810 - 70*T) must be divisible by 30, and the result should be the number of shirts S, which must be a non-negative integer.\n\nAlternatively, since 70 and 30 have a common factor of 10, maybe I can simplify the equation. Let's divide the entire equation by 10 to make it easier:\n\n7T + 3S = 81\n\nNow, the problem is to find the maximum integer T such that 81 -7T is non-negative and divisible by 3.\n\nBecause 3S must equal 81 -7T, so 81-7T must be >=0 and also must be divisible by 3.\n\nWait, 7T must be <=81. So T can be at most 11, since 7*11=77, which is less than 81. 7*12=84 which is more than 81, so T can't be 12. So the maximum possible T is 11. But wait, let's check if 81 -7*11 is divisible by 3.\n\n7*11=77. 81-77=4. 4 divided by 3 is 1.333..., which is not an integer. So S would not be an integer. That's a problem. So T=11 isn't possible because it doesn't result in an integer number of shirts.\n\nSo we need to go down to T=10. Let's check:\n\n7*10=70. 81-70=11. 11 divided by 3 is approximately 3.666..., which isn't an integer either. So T=10 isn't possible either.\n\nHmm, next is T=9.\n\n7*9=63. 81-63=18. 18 divided by 3 is 6. That's an integer. So S=6. So when T=9, S=6. That works.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I should check all Ts from 11 downwards until I find one that gives S as an integer. Because perhaps T=8 is possible, but maybe a higher T than 9 is possible?

But T=6 is less than 9, so 9 is the maximum.\n\nYes, so the correct answer is 9 trousers, option A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let the number of trousers be \\( T \\) and the number of shirts be \\( S \\). Each trouser costs Rs 70, and each shirt costs Rs 30.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question is about a man who spends 810 rupees. He's buying trousers and shirts. Each trouser costs 70 rupees, and each shirt is 30 rupees. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are from A to E, each giving a different number of trousers, like 9, 8, etc. So, I need to find out which option gives the maximum number of trousers possible without exceeding the total amount he spent.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. So, the total money spent is 810. Let me denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. The cost equation would be 70*T + 30*S = 810. Because each trouser is 70 and each shirt is 30.\n\nThe goal is to maximize T, which means we need to find the maximum possible integer value of T such that when we subtract the cost of T trousers from 810, the remaining money can be exactly divided by the cost of a shirt (30). Because if there's any leftover money that can't be used to buy a shirt, that wouldn't be allowed. So, the remaining amount after buying T trousers must be divisible by 30.\n\nSo, the approach would be to find the largest T such that (810 - 70*T) is divisible by 30. Also, T should be as large as possible but not so large that 70*T exceeds 810.\n\nLet me think about how to compute this. Let's reorganize the equation:\n\n70T + 30S = 810\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 10 to make the numbers smaller and easier to handle.\n\n7T + 3S = 81\n\nSo now, the equation is 7T + 3S = 81. We can rearrange this to solve for S:\n\n3S = 81 - 7T\nS = (81 -7T)/3\n\nSince S must be a whole number, (81 -7T) must be divisible by 3. Let's check when this is true.\n\n81 divided by 3 is 27, so 81 is divisible by 3. For (81 -7T) to be divisible by 3, 7T must also leave a remainder such that when subtracted, the total is a multiple of 3.\n\nWait, let's think about the modulus. 81 mod 3 is 0. 7T mod 3 should also be 0 because 81 -7T must be divisible by 3. 7 mod 3 is 1, so 7T mod 3 is equal to (T mod 3). Because 7 is congruent to 1 mod 3, so 7*T is congruent to T mod 3. Therefore, 7T mod 3 = T mod 3. So, for (81 -7T) to be divisible by 3, 7T must be congruent to 0 mod 3. Which means T mod 3 must be 0. So T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nWait, let me think again. Because 81 mod 3 is 0. So, 7T mod 3 must be 0. Since 7 mod 3 is 1, 7T mod 3 is same as T mod 3. So, T mod 3 must be 0. So T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo, T can be 3,6,9,12... but T can't be so large that 70T exceeds 810.\n\nWait, let's calculate the maximum possible T without considering shirts. The maximum T would be when all money is spent on trousers.\n\nMaximum T possible is floor(810 /70) = let's see, 70 * 11 is 770, 70*12 is 840 which is more than 810. So maximum possible T is 11. But 11 is not a multiple of 3. So, the next lower multiple of 3 is 9. So T=9.\n\nWait, but let me check if T=9 is possible.\n\nIf T=9, then 70*9 = 630. The remaining money is 810-630=180. Then, 180 divided by 30 is 6. So S=6. So that's valid. So T=9, S=6. The ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question is about the ratio when maximum T is bought, so we need to find the maximum possible T.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check if T=10 is possible. Because 10 is more than 9. Wait, but earlier, I thought T must be a multiple of 3 because 7T mod3 must be 0. But 10 is not a multiple of 3, so T=10 would not satisfy that condition.\n\nLet me compute T=10. 70*10=700. Remaining money is 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666... which is not an integer. So S would be 3.666, which isn't possible because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So T=10 is invalid.\n\nHow about T=11? 70*11=770. Remaining money is 40. 40/30 is 1.333..., which is again not an integer. So S=1.333, invalid.\n\nSo the next lower T is 9, which works.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. The question asks for the ratio of trousers to shirts when maximum number of trousers is purchased. So in the case of T=9, S=6. The ratio is 9:6, which can be simplified to 3:2.\n\nBut the options are giving the number of trousers. The options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11.\n\nSo the correct answer is option A, 9 trousers. So the ratio is 9:6, but the question is only about the number of trousers when maximum is bought.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Are there any other possibilities where T is higher than 9 but still gives an integer S?\n\nLike, for example, T=12? 70*12=840, which is more than 810. So no. So T can't be 12.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the modulus approach. Let me try a different approach. Let's try to find all possible T values and see which gives the maximum T and integer S.\n\nWe can write the equation as:\n\n70T +30S=810.\n\nLet me try to find T such that 810 -70T is divisible by 30.\n\nSo, 810 mod 30 is 0, since 30*27=810. So 70T mod30 must also be 0.\n\n70 mod30 is 10 (since 30*2=60, 70-60=10). So 70T mod30 = (10T) mod30. So 10T must be congruent to 0 mod30. Which implies that 10T is a multiple of 30. So 10T=30k, where k is an integer. So T=3k. So T must be a multiple of 3. So T can be 3,6,9,12,... but as before, T can't be higher than 11 because 70*12=840>810.\n\nSo the possible T values are 3,6,9.\n\nWait, but wait, when T=9, 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. So S=6. So that's valid.\n\nIf I try T=12, 70*12=840>810, so no.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I should check all possible T from 0 up to 11 and see which ones give integer S.\n\nLet me try each T from 0 to 11:\n\nT=0: 70*0=0. 810-0=810. S=810/30=27. So S=27. Valid.\n\nT=1: 70*1=70. 810-70=740. 740/30=24.666... Not integer.\n\nT=2: 140. 810-140=670. 670/30=22.333... No.\n\nT=3: 210. 810-210=600. 600/30=20. Yes. So T=3, S=20.\n\nT=4: 280. 810-280=530. 530/30=17.666... No.\n\nT=5: 350. 810-350=460. 460/30=15.333... No.\n\nT=6: 420. 810-420=390. 390/30=13. Yes. So T=6, S=13.\n\nT=7: 490. 810-490=320. 320/30=10.666... No.\n\nT=8: 560. 810-560=250. 250/30=8.333... No.\n\nT=9: 630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. Yes. So T=9, S=6.\n\nT=10: 700. 810-700=110. 110/30=3.666... No.\n\nT=11: 770. 810-770=40. 40/30=1.333... No.\n\nSo the possible T values that give integer S are 0,3,6,9. Among these, the maximum T is 9. So the ratio is 9:6, but the question is only about the number of trousers when maximum is bought, so the answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, the options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11. So the correct option is A)9. So the answer is option A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question is about a man who spends 810 rupees. He's buying trousers and shirts. Each trouser costs 70 rupees, and each shirt is 30 rupees. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are from A to E, each giving a different number of trousers, like 9, 8, etc. So, I need to find out which option gives the maximum number of trousers possible without exceeding the total amount he spent.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. So, the total money spent is 810. Let me denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. The cost equation would be 70*T + 30*S = 810. Because each trouser is 70 and each shirt is 30.\n\nThe goal is to maximize T, which means we need to find the maximum possible integer value of T such that when we subtract the cost of T trousers from 810, the remaining money can be exactly divided by the cost of a shirt (30). Because if there's any leftover money that can't be used to buy a shirt, that wouldn't be allowed. So, the remaining amount after buying T trousers must be divisible by 30.\n\nSo, the approach would be to find the largest T such that (810 - 70*T) is divisible by 30. Also, T should be as large as possible but not so large that 70*T exceeds 810.\n\nLet me think about how to compute this. Let's reorganize the equation:\n\n70T + 30S = 810\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 10 to make the numbers smaller and easier to handle.\n\n7T + 3S = 81\n\nSo now, the equation is 7T + 3S = 81. We can rearrange this to solve for S:\n\n3S = 81 - 7T\nS = (81 -7T)/3\n\nSince S must be a whole number, (81 -7T) must be divisible by 3. Let's check when this is true.\n\n81 divided by 3 is 27, so 81 is divisible by 3. For (81 -7T) to be divisible by 3, 7T must also leave a remainder such that when subtracted, the total is a multiple of 3.\n\nWait, let's think about the modulus. 81 mod 3 is 0. 7T mod 3 should also be 0 because 81 -7T must be divisible by 3. 7 mod 3 is 1, so 7T mod 3 is equal to (T mod 3). Because 7 is congruent to 1 mod 3, so 7*T is congruent to T mod 3. Therefore, 7T mod 3 = T mod 3. So, for (81 -7T) to be divisible by 3, 7T must be congruent to 0 mod 3. Which means T mod 3 must be 0. So T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nWait, let me think again. Because 81 mod 3 is 0. So, 7T mod 3 must be 0. Since 7 mod 3 is 1, 7T mod 3 is same as T mod 3. So, T mod 3 must be 0. So T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo, T can be 3,6,9,12... but T can't be so large that 70T exceeds 810.\n\nWait, let's calculate the maximum possible T without considering shirts. The maximum T would be when all money is spent on trousers.\n\nMaximum T possible is floor(810 /70) = let's see, 70 * 11 is 770, 70*12 is 840 which is more than 810. So maximum possible T is 11. But 11 is not a multiple of 3. So, the next lower multiple of 3 is 9. So T=9.\n\nWait, but let me check if T=9 is possible.\n\nIf T=9, then 70*9 = 630. The remaining money is 810-630=180. Then, 180 divided by 30 is 6. So S=6. So that's valid. So T=9, S=6. The ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question is about the ratio when maximum T is bought, so we need to find the maximum possible T.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check if T=10 is possible. Because 10 is more than 9. Wait, but earlier, I thought T must be a multiple of 3 because 7T mod3 must be 0. But 10 is not a multiple of 3, so T=10 would not satisfy that condition.\n\nLet me compute T=10. 70*10=700. Remaining money is 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666... which is not an integer. So S would be 3.666, which isn't possible because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So T=10 is invalid.\n\nHow about T=11? 70*11=770. Remaining money is 40. 40/30 is 1.333..., which is again not an integer. So S=1.333, invalid.\n\nSo the next lower T is 9, which works.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. The question asks for the ratio of trousers to shirts when maximum number of trousers is purchased. So in the case of T=9, S=6. The ratio is 9:6, which can be simplified to 3:2.\n\nBut the options are giving the number of trousers. The options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11.\n\nSo the correct answer is option A, 9 trousers. So the ratio is 9:6, but the question is only about the number of trousers when maximum is bought.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Are there any other possibilities where T is higher than 9 but still gives an integer S?\n\nLike, for example, T=12? 70*12=840, which is more than 810. So no. So T can't be 12.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the modulus approach. Let me try a different approach. Let's try to find all possible T values and see which gives the maximum T and integer S.\n\nWe can write the equation as:\n\n70T +30S=810.\n\nLet me try to find T such that 810 -70T is divisible by 30.\n\nSo, 810 mod 30 is 0, since 30*27=810. So 70T mod30 must also be 0.\n\n70 mod30 is 10 (since 30*2=60, 70-60=10). So 70T mod30 = (10T) mod30. So 10T must be congruent to 0 mod30. Which implies that 10T is a multiple of 30. So 10T=30k, where k is an integer. So T=3k. So T must be a multiple of 3. So T can be 3,6,9,12,... but as before, T can't be higher than 11 because 70*12=840>810.\n\nSo the possible T values are 3,6,9.\n\nWait, but wait, when T=9, 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. So S=6. So that's valid.\n\nIf I try T=12, 70*12=840>810, so no.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I should check all possible T from 0 up to 11 and see which ones give integer S.\n\nLet me try each T from 0 to 11:\n\nT=0: 70*0=0. 810-0=810. S=810/30=27. So S=27. Valid.\n\nT=1: 70*1=70. 810-70=740. 740/30=24.666... Not integer.\n\nT=2: 140. 810-140=670. 670/30=22.333... No.\n\nT=3: 210. 810-210=600. 600/30=20. Yes. So T=3, S=20.\n\nT=4: 280. 810-280=530. 530/30=17.666... No.\n\nT=5: 350. 810-350=460. 460/30=15.333... No.\n\nT=6: 420. 810-420=390. 390/30=13. Yes. So T=6, S=13.\n\nT=7: 490. 810-490=320. 320/30=10.666... No.\n\nT=8: 560. 810-560=250. 250/30=8.333... No.\n\nT=9: 630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. Yes.

So the ratio is 9:6, but the question is only about the number of trousers when maximum is bought, so the answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, the options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where a man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. The trousers cost 70 rupees each, and the shirts are 30 rupees each. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are from A to E, with numbers ranging from 7 to 11. Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We're supposed to find the ratio, but only when the number of trousers is as high as possible. That makes me think that the man is buying as many trousers as he can with 810 rupees, and then the remaining money is spent on shirts. So the key is to maximize the number of trousers.\n\nLet me denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. The total cost equation would then be:\n\n70*T + 30*S = 810\n\nWe're trying to maximize T, so I should find the maximum possible integer value of T such that when multiplied by 70, the remaining amount is divisible by 30 for the shirts. Because if the remaining amount isn't divisible by 30, he can't buy a whole number of shirts. So, the remaining amount after buying T trousers must be a multiple of 30.\n\nSo, let's rearrange the equation to solve for S:\n\n30*S = 810 - 70*T\n\nS = (810 - 70*T)/30\n\nS has to be an integer, so (810 -70T) must be divisible by 30. Let's simplify this expression. Let's factor out 10:\n\n810 = 10 * 81\n70 = 10 * 7\n30 = 10 * 3\n\nSo,\n\nS = (10*(81 -7*T)) / (10*3) ) = (81 -7*T)/3\n\nSo, (81 -7*T) must be divisible by 3. Let's write that condition:\n\n81 -7T \u2261 0 mod 3\n\nSince 81 is divisible by 3 (because 8+1=9, which is divisible by 3), 81 mod 3 is 0.\n\nSo, the condition becomes:\n\n(-7T) \u2261 0 mod 3\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\n7T \u2261 0 mod 3\n\nBut 7 mod 3 is 1, because 3*2=6, so 7-6=1.\n\nSo,\n\n1*T \u2261 0 mod 3 \u2192 T \u2261 0 mod 3.\n\nSo T must be a multiple of 3. That gives possible values for T as 3,6,9,... but we also need to ensure that 70*T does not exceed 810.\n\nLet me compute the maximum possible T.\n\nMaximum T is when 70*T \u2264 810.\n\n810 /70 = 11.571... So the maximum integer T can be 11, but wait, 11 is not a multiple of 3. The next lower multiple of 3 is 9.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me check: 11 is not a multiple of 3, so the next possible T is 9. But is 9 the maximum possible? Let me check.\n\nWait, if T is 11, is it possible?\n\nWait, if T=11, then 70*11 = 770. Remaining money is 810 -770 =40. Then, 40 divided by 30 is 1.333..., which is not an integer. So S would be 1.333, which is not possible. So T=11 is invalid.\n\nNext, T=10. Is 10 a multiple of 3? No, because 10 divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder of 1. So 10 is not a multiple of 3. So, let's try T=10:\n\n70*10=700. Remaining money is 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666..., which is not an integer. So T=10 is invalid.\n\nNext, T=9. Let's check: 70*9=630. Remaining is 810-630=180. 180 divided by 30 is 6, which is an integer. So S=6. That works.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9. Now, the ratio of T to S is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But wait, the question is asking for the ratio of trouser to shirt when maximum T is purchased. So the ratio is 9:6 or 3:2. But looking at the options, the options are all about the number of trousers. The options are A)9, B)8, etc. So the answer should be 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any higher T. Let me check T=12. Wait, 70*12=840, which is more than 810. So that's not possible.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9, so the ratio is 9 shirts? Wait no, the ratio is 9 trousers to 6 shirts. But the question is about the ratio, but the options are only about the number of trousers. The question is phrased as \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\"\n\nWait, the way the question is phrased: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" Hmm, the options are all just the number of trousers, like option A is 9 Trousers. Wait, perhaps the question is actually asking what is the number of trousers, not the ratio. Because the options are numbers, not ratios.\n\nWait, let me re-read the question.\n\nThe question says: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\"\n\nHmm, that wording is a bit confusing. Are they asking for the ratio (like T:S) or the number of trousers?

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here where a man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. The trousers cost 70 rupees each, and the shirts are 30 rupees each. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are from A to E, with numbers ranging from 7 to 11. Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We're supposed to find the ratio, but only when the number of trousers is as high as possible. That makes me think that the man is buying as many trousers as he can with 810 rupees, and then the remaining money is spent on shirts. So the key is to maximize the number of trousers.\n\nLet me denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. The total cost equation would then be:\n\n70*T + 30*S = 810\n\nWe're trying to maximize T, so I should find the maximum possible integer value of T such that when multiplied by 70, the remaining amount is divisible by 30 for the shirts. Because if the remaining amount isn't divisible by 30, he can't buy a whole number of shirts. So, the remaining amount after buying T trousers must be a multiple of 30.\n\nSo, let's rearrange the equation to solve for S:\n\n30*S = 810 - 70*T\n\nS = (810 - 70*T)/30\n\nS has to be an integer, so (810 -70T) must be divisible by 30. Let's simplify this expression. Let's factor out 10:\n\n810 = 10 * 81\n70 = 10 * 7\n30 = 10 * 3\n\nSo,\n\nS = (10*(81 -7*T)) / (10*3) ) = (81 -7*T)/3\n\nSo, (81 -7*T) must be divisible by 3. Let's write that condition:\n\n81 -7T \u2261 0 mod 3\n\nSince 81 is divisible by 3 (because 8+1=9, which is divisible by 3), 81 mod 3 is 0.\n\nSo, the condition becomes:\n\n(-7T) \u2261 0 mod 3\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\n7T \u2261 0 mod 3\n\nBut 7 mod 3 is 1, because 3*2=6, so 7-6=1.\n\nSo,\n\n1*T \u2261 0 mod 3 \u2192 T \u2261 0 mod 3.\n\nSo T must be a multiple of 3. That gives possible values for T as 3,6,9,... but we also need to ensure that 70*T does not exceed 810.\n\nLet me compute the maximum possible T.\n\nMaximum T is when 70*T \u2264 810.\n\n810 /70 = 11.571... So the maximum integer T can be 11, but wait, 11 is not a multiple of 3. The next lower multiple of 3 is 9.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me check: 11 is not a multiple of 3, so the next possible T is 9. But is 9 the maximum possible? Let me check.\n\nWait, if T is 11, is it possible?\n\nWait, if T=11, then 70*11 = 770. Remaining money is 810 -770 =40. Then, 40 divided by 30 is 1.333..., which is not an integer. So S would be 1.333, which is not possible. So T=11 is invalid.\n\nNext, T=10. Is 10 a multiple of 3? No, because 10 divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder of 1. So 10 is not a multiple of 3. So, let's try T=10:\n\n70*10=700. Remaining money is 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666..., which is not an integer. So T=10 is invalid.\n\nNext, T=9. Let's check: 70*9=630. Remaining is 810-630=180. 180 divided by 30 is 6, which is an integer. So S=6. That works.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9. Now, the ratio of T to S is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But wait, the question is asking for the ratio of trouser to shirt when maximum T is purchased. So the ratio is 9:6 or 3:2. But looking at the options, the options are all about the number of trousers. The options are A)9, B)8, etc. So the answer should be 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any higher T. Let me check T=12. Wait, 70*12=840, which is more than 810. So that's not possible.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9, so the ratio is 9 shirts? Wait no, the ratio is 9 trousers to 6 shirts. But the question is about the ratio, but the options are only about the number of trousers. The question is phrased as \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\"\n\nWait, the way the question is phrased: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" Hmm, the options are all just the number of trousers, like option A is 9 Trousers. Wait, perhaps the question is actually asking what is the number of trousers, not the ratio. Because the options are numbers, not ratios.\n\nWait, let me re-read the question.\n\nThe question says: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\"\n\nHmm, that wording is a bit confusing. Are they asking for the ratio (like T:S) or the number of trousers?

Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe question says a man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. Each trouser costs 70 rupees, and each shirt costs 30 rupees. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are from A to E, each giving a number of trousers.\n\nWait, wait. So the main goal here is to maximize the number of trousers he buys with 810 rupees. But then we also need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts in that scenario. Hmm, okay.\n\nLet me think. So, he's buying two things: trousers and shirts. The total amount he spends is 810. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S.\n\nEach trouser is 70, so the cost for T trousers is 70*T. Each shirt is 30, so shirts cost 30*S. The total is 810. So the equation would be:\n\n70T + 30S = 810.\n\nBut he wants to buy as many trousers as possible. That means we need to maximize T, subject to the equation above. So, we need to find the maximum possible integer value of T such that the remaining money can be spent on shirts, which are cheaper.\n\nSo, let's think about it. Let's try to find the maximum T such that 70T \u2264 810.\n\nWait, but he's also buying shirts, so the total must add up to exactly 810. So, 70T + 30S = 810. We can rearrange this equation to find S in terms of T.\n\nSo, 30S = 810 -70T \u2192 S = (810 -70T)/30.\n\nSince S has to be a whole number (you can't buy a fraction of a shirt), (810 -70T) must be divisible by 30.\n\nLet me see. So 810 divided by 30 is 27, because 30*27=810. Similarly, 70T divided by 30 is (7T)/3, because 70=7*10 and 30=3*10. So, when we subtract, (810-70T)/30 = 27 - (7T)/3.\n\nSo for S to be an integer, (7T)/3 must be an integer because 27 is already an integer. So 7T must be divisible by 3. Since 7 and 3 are coprime (they have no common factors except 1), T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo T has to be such that T is a multiple of 3. Now, we need to find the maximum T such that 70T \u2264810, and T is a multiple of 3.\n\nLet's compute the maximum possible T without considering the divisibility by 3 first. So 810 divided by 70 is approximately 11.57. So the maximum integer T would be 11. But wait, 11 is not a multiple of 3. The next lower multiple of 3 is 9, since 9 is 3*3.\n\nWait, but let's check if T=11 is possible. If T=11, then 70*11=770. The remaining money is 810-770=40. Then S=40/30 = 1.333... which is not an integer. So that's not possible.\n\nSo T=11 is not acceptable. Next, let's check T=10. 70*10=700. Remaining money is 810-700=110. Then S=110/30=3.666... again not an integer. So T=10 is also not acceptable.\n\nNext, T=9. 70*9=630. Remaining money is 810-630=180. S=180/30=6. That's an integer. So T=9 and S=6 is a valid combination.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's a higher T that's a multiple of 3. Wait, 9 is the next after 11 and 10. Let me see, 9 is a multiple of 3. What about T=12? 70*12=840, which is more than 810, so that's not possible. So the maximum T possible is 9.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me think about the equation again. 70T +30S =810.\n\nWe can factor out 10 from each term: 10*(7T +3S) = 810 \u2192 7T +3S=81.\n\nNow, we can write this as 3S=81 -7T \u2192 S=(81-7T)/3.\n\nSo, 81 -7T must be divisible by 3. So 7T must be congruent to 0 mod 3 because 81 is 0 mod 3. Since 7 mod3 is 1 (because 7/3 is 2*3=6, remainder 1), 7T mod3 is equal to (1*T) mod3. So 7T \u2261 T mod3. So for 81-7T to be divisible by 3, T must be \u22610 mod3. So T has to be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo the maximum T is the largest multiple of 3 less than or equal to 810/70, which is around 11.57. So the next lower multiple of 3 is 9. So T=9 is the maximum possible.\n\nSo when T=9, S= (81-7*9)/3 = (81-63)/3=18/3=6.\n\nSo the ratio of T:S is 9:6, which can be simplified. Dividing both by 3, it's 3:2.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the ratio of trouser to shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the options don't give a ratio; they just give the number of trousers. So the question is asking for the number of trousers, which is 9. So the correct option is A)9 Trousers.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because the options are only giving the number of trousers, and the question is to find the ratio of trousers and shirts when maximum trousers are bought. So the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2, but the question's options don't have that. Wait, no, the options are giving the number of trousers, not the ratio. Oh, wait, the question says 'the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.' So the ratio would be 9 trousers to 6 shirts, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question is probably asking for the number of trousers, which is 9, so the answer is option A.\n\nWait, no, the options are for the number of trousers.

So 810 divided by 30 is 27, because 30*27=810. Similarly, 70T divided by 30 is (7T)/3, because 70=7*10 and 30=3*10. So, when we subtract, (810-70T)/30 = 27 - (7T)/3.\n\nSo for S to be an integer, (7T)/3 must be an integer because 27 is already an integer. So 7T must be divisible by 3.

So the next lower multiple of 3 is 9. So T=9 is the maximum possible.\n\nSo when T=9, S= (81-7*9)/3 = (81-63)/3=18/3=6.\n\nSo the ratio of T:S is 9:6, which can be simplified. Dividing both by 3, it's 3:2.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the ratio of trouser to shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the options don't give a ratio; they just give the number of trousers. So the question is asking for the number of trousers, which is 9. So the correct option is A)9 Trousers.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because the options are only giving the number of trousers, and the question is to find the ratio of trousers and shirts when maximum trousers are bought. So the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2, but the question's options don't have that. Wait, no, the options are giving the number of trousers, not the ratio. Oh, wait, the question says 'the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.' So the ratio would be 9 trousers to 6 shirts, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question is probably asking for the number of trousers, which is 9, so the answer is option A.\n\nWait, no, the options are for the number of trousers. So the correct answer is 9, which is option A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of trousers a man can buy with 810 rupees, given that each trouser costs 70 rupees and each shirt costs 30 rupees. The total expenditure is represented by the equation:\n\n\\[\n70T + 30S = 810\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(T\\) is the number of trousers and \\(S\\) is the number of shirts. The goal is to maximize \\(T\\) while ensuring \\(S\\) is an integer.\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the equation\nDividing the entire equation by 10:\n\n\\[\n7T + 3S = 81\n\\]\n\nRearranging for \\(S\\):\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{81 - 7T}{3}\n\\]\n\nFor \\(S\\) to be an integer, \\((81 - 7T)\\) must be divisible by 3. Since \\(7 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3\\), \\(7T \\equiv T \\mod 3\\). Thus, \\(T\\) must be a multiple of 3 to satisfy the divisibility condition.\n\n### Step 2: Find the maximum \\(T\\)\nThe maximum possible \\(T\\) without considering the divisibility constraint is:\n\n\\[\nT \\leq \\frac{810}{70} \\approx 11.57\n\\]\n\nSince \\(T\\) must be an integer, the maximum possible \\(T\\) is 11. However, 11 is not a multiple of 3. The largest multiple of 3 less than or equal to 11 is 9. Thus, \\(T = 9\\).\n\n### Step 3: Verify the solution\nSubstituting \\(T = 9\\) into the equation:\n\n\\[\n70(9) + 30S = 810 \\implies 630 + 30S = 810 \\implies 30S = 180 \\implies S = 6\n\\]\n\nThis is valid since \\(S = 6\\) is an integer. Therefore, the maximum number of trousers is 9, and the corresponding number of shirts is 6.\n\n### Step 4: Ratio of trousers to shirts\nThe ratio of trousers to shirts is:\n\n\\[\nT:S = 9:6 = 3:2\n\\]\n\nHowever, the question only asks for the number of trousers when the maximum number is purchased. Thus, the answer is 9.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**Answer: A**",

Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: A man spends 810 rupees in buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. What will be the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased?\n\nWait, the options are given as A)9 Trousers, B)8, and so on. Hmm, so the options are giving the number of trousers, but the question is about the ratio of trousers to shirts. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read.\n\nOh wait, the question is asking for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So the man wants to buy as many trousers as possible with 810 rupees, and then find the ratio of trousers to shirts. Or perhaps the ratio is the number of trousers to shirts he ends up buying.\n\nLet me think. So, each trouser is 70, shirt 30. He spends total 810.\n\nLet me model this with variables. Let\u2019s say the number of trousers is T, shirts is S.\n\nSo the equation is 70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nWe need to find T and S such that T is as large as possible. Because the man wants to buy the maximum number of trousers.\n\nSo, the goal is to maximize T. So, I need to find the maximum T possible, given that 70*T \u2264 810, and then see what the corresponding S would be.\n\nWait, but S also has to be a non-negative integer because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt.\n\nSo, maximum T is floor(810 /70). Let me calculate that.\n\n810 divided by 70. 70*11 is 770, which is 70*11=770. 70*12 is 840, which is over 810. So 11 is too much, so maximum T is 11? Wait no, wait. 70*11=770, which leaves 810-770=40. Then, 40 divided by 30 is 1.333, which is not an integer. So S would have to be 1, but 30*1=30, so 770 +30=800. Then 810-800=10. But 10 isn't enough to buy another shirt. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, so if T=11, then 70*11=770, so remaining is 40. But shirts are 30 each. So S can be 1, but then 30*1=30, and 770+30=800. That's under 810, but we have 10 rupees left, which isn't enough for another shirt. So that's not possible because he can't have partial items.\n\nWait, but maybe the man can't spend all the money, but he must spend exactly 810. Or maybe he can spend less, but I think the problem states that he spends exactly 810. So T and S must satisfy 70T +30S=810.\n\nSo, perhaps I should model this as a linear equation and find integer solutions.\n\nSo, 70T +30S=810.\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 10: 7T + 3S =81.\n\nWe need to find integer values of T and S \u22650 such that 7T +3S=81, and T is as large as possible.\n\nSo, the problem becomes solving for T and S.\n\nTo find maximum T, let's rearrange the equation: 3S = 81 -7T.\n\nSo, 81 -7T must be divisible by 3, and S must be a non-negative integer.\n\nLet me see what values of T make 81-7T divisible by 3.\n\n81 is divisible by 3, 7T mod 3 must be 0 as well.\n\nBecause 81 mod3 is 0, so 7T mod3 must be 0.\n\n7 mod3 is 1. So 7T mod3 is (1*T) mod3. So 1*T \u22610 mod3 \u2192 T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo T can be 0,3,6,9, etc.\n\nBut we want maximum T, so let's find the largest T which is a multiple of 3, such that 7T \u226481.\n\nWait, 7T \u226481 \u2192 T \u226481/7\u224811.57. So the maximum possible T is 11, but earlier calculation shows that T=11 would require S= (81 -7*11)/3 = (81-77)/3=4/3\u22481.333, which is not an integer. So that doesn't work.\n\nSo we need to find the largest T \u226411 which is a multiple of 3. The next lower is 9.\n\nSo T=9. Then S= (81-7*9)/3 \u2192 81-63=18 \u2192 18/3=6. So S=6. So 9 trousers and 6 shirts, which uses 70*9=630, 30*6=180; 630+180=810. Perfect.\n\nSo the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But wait, the question is asking for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the options are giving the number of trousers, but the question is about the ratio.\n\nWait, looking back, the question says: What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\n\nAh, so the ratio is T:S. So 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nBut the options given are about the number of trousers. So, the options are A)9, B)8, etc. So perhaps the question is asking for the number of trousers when maximum is purchased, which is 9. So the correct answer is option A)9.\n\nWait, but the options are labeled A to E, with each being a number of trousers. So the question's actual question is: what is the maximum number of trousers he can buy? Or is it the ratio?\n\nWait, the question says: 'what will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?' So the ratio is T:S, but the options are giving the number of trousers. Hmm, perhaps the question is worded incorrectly, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are giving the ratio, but the way it's written, the options are just the number of trousers. Wait, the options are written as A)9 Trousers, B)8 Trousers, etc. So they're giving the count of trousers, not the ratio.\n\nWait, so the problem is to find the maximum number of trousers he can buy, which is 9, so the answer is A)9.\n\nWait, but why did I think earlier that 11 is possible? Because 70*11=770, but then 40 remains. But 40 can't buy any shirts as each is 30. So 11 is not possible because that would leave some money unspent. But the equation requires 70T +30S=810, so we can't have 11 because S would not be an integer.\n\nSo the next possible is T=9, which gives S=6. So that's the maximum number of trousers possible.\n\nSo the answer should be A)9.\n\nBut wait, looking again at the options: the options are labeled with letters and the number of trousers. So the correct number is 9, which is option A.\n\nSo the answer is A.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here. Let me read it again. A man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. Trousers are 70 each, shirts are 30 each. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. Hmm, and the options are given as A to E, each with a number of trousers.\n\nWait, so the key here is to maximize the number of trousers. That makes sense. So I need to find how many trousers he can buy with 810 rupees, and the remaining money would go towards shirts. But wait, I need to make sure that the total doesn't exceed 810, right?\n\nLet me think. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S. The total cost would be 70T + 30S = 810. I need to maximize T, so I should try to buy as many trousers as possible without exceeding the total amount.\n\nSo, to maximize T, I should spend as much as possible on trousers. So the maximum possible T would be when 70T is just less than or equal to 810.\n\nLet me calculate that. 70 times T equals 810. So T is 810 divided by 70. Let me compute that. 70 times 11 is 770, because 70*10 is 700, plus 70 is 770. 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So the maximum T can be 11, but wait, wait. Because 70*11 is 770, which leaves 810-770=40 rupees for shirts. Now, each shirt is 30, so 40 divided by 30 is 1.333. But you can't buy a fraction of a shirt, so you can buy only 1 shirt. But then, the total spent would be 770 +30=800. That leaves 10 rupees unused. So, wait, can he buy more shirts? No, because 30*2 is 60, which would require 70*11 +30*2=770+60=830, which is more than 810. So that's not possible.\n\nWait, but wait. Maybe if he buys one less trouser, he can buy more shirts. Let's check. For example, T=11, S=1, total spent 800, 10 left. If T=10, then 70*10=700, leaving 110 for shirts. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666, so 3 shirts, which is 90, total 700+90=790, leaving 20. That's not better for maximizing T.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So T=11 is the maximum possible, because 12 would be 840, which is over 810.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 11 is possible because 70*11=770, which is under 810. So that's correct.\n\nSo then, with T=11, he has 40 left. He can buy 1 shirt (30) and have 10 left. Alternatively, maybe he can buy another shirt if he reduces the number of trousers. But since we are to maximize T, we have to stick with T=11 and S=1. But wait, wait another thing. Because 70*11 +30*S =810. So 770 +30S=810 \u2192 30S=40 \u2192 S=40/30=4/3\u22481.333. So S must be an integer, so 1 shirt. So the numbers are T=11, S=1.\n\nWait, but the question is about the ratio of trousers to shirts. So 11:1.

Wait, no, let me read the question again.\n\nWait, the question says: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So the ratio is T:S, but the options are numbers of trousers.

So perhaps the correct answer is E.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. So 11 trousers at 70 each is 770, and 1 shirt at 30, total 800, with 10 remaining. Alternatively, can he buy more shirts without reducing the number of trousers? No, because 30*2 is 60, which would make the total 770+60=830>810. So S must be 1.\n\nSo the ratio is 11:1, which would be option E, which is 11 Trousers. So the answer is E.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check if 11 is possible. 70*11=770, 810-770=40. 40 can buy 1 shirt (30), leaving 10. So yes, that's possible. So the ratio is 11:1.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here. Let me read it again. A man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. Trousers are 70 each, shirts are 30 each. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. Hmm, and the options are given as A to E, each with a number of trousers.\n\nWait, so the key here is to maximize the number of trousers. That makes sense. So I need to find how many trousers he can buy with 810 rupees, and the remaining money would go towards shirts. But wait, I need to make sure that the total doesn't exceed 810, right?\n\nLet me think. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S. The total cost would be 70T + 30S = 810. I need to maximize T, so I should try to buy as many trousers as possible without exceeding the total amount.\n\nSo, to maximize T, I should spend as much as possible on trousers. So the maximum possible T would be when 70T is just less than or equal to 810.\n\nLet me calculate that. 70 times T equals 810. So T is 810 divided by 70. Let me compute that. 70 times 11 is 770, because 70*10 is 700, plus 70 is 770. 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So the maximum T can be 11, but wait, wait. Because 70*11 is 770, which leaves 810-770=40 rupees for shirts. Now, each shirt is 30, so 40 divided by 30 is 1.333. But you can't buy a fraction of a shirt, so you can buy only 1 shirt. But then, the total spent would be 770 +30=800. That leaves 10 rupees unused. So, wait, can he buy more shirts? No, because 30*2 is 60, which would require 70*11 +30*2=770+60=830, which is more than 810. So that's not possible.\n\nWait, but wait. Maybe if he buys one less trouser, he can buy more shirts. Let's check. For example, T=11, S=1, total spent 800, 10 left. If T=10, then 70*10=700, leaving 110 for shirts. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666, so 3 shirts, which is 90, total 700+90=790, leaving 20. That's not better for maximizing T.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So T=11 is the maximum possible, because 12 would be 840, which is over 810.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 11 is possible because 70*11=770, which is under 810. So that's correct.\n\nSo then, with T=11, he has 40 left. He can buy 1 shirt (30) and have 10 left. Alternatively, maybe he can buy another shirt if he reduces the number of trousers. But since we are to maximize T, we have to stick with T=11 and S=1. But wait, wait another thing. Because 70*11 +30*S =810. So 770 +30S=810 \u2192 30S=40 \u2192 S=40/30=4/3\u22481.333. So S must be an integer, so 1 shirt. So the numbers are T=11, S=1.\n\nWait, but the question is about the ratio of trousers to shirts. So 11:1. But wait, looking at the options, the options are all about the number of trousers, not the ratio. Wait, the options are labeled A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. Wait, no.

The trousers cost 70 each and shirts are 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased.\n\nWait, the question is a bit confusing. Oh right, the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers. So, he's trying to buy as many trousers as possible within 810 rupees. Then, whatever is left he uses to buy shirts. Then, we find the ratio of trouser count to shirt count.\n\nSo, the first thing I think is to find out the maximum number of trousers he can buy with 810. Each trouser is 70, so divide 810 by 70. Let me calculate that.\n\n810 divided by 70. Let's see, 70 times 11 is 770, which is 770. Then, 70 times 12 would be 840, which is more than 810. So, 11 is too much because 70*11=770. Wait, no, 70*11 is 770, which is less than 810. Wait, no, 70*11 is 770, which is under 810. So, he can buy 11 trousers. Because 70*11=770, leaving 810-770=40 rupees. But then, with 40, can he buy shirts? Each shirt is 30. So 40 divided by 30 is 1 with 10 rupees left, but that's not enough for another shirt. So, he can buy 1 shirt with the remaining 40, because 30*1=30, leaving 10, which is not enough.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 11. Let me check the options again. The options are A to E, with E being 11. Oh, right, the options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11. So E is 11, which would be the maximum number of trousers possible.\n\nWait, but wait another thing.

So the number of shirts is 1.\n\nSo the ratio of trousers to shirts would be 11:1. But the question is asking for the ratio of trouser to shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.

So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, the question says: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So maybe it's not asking for the count of each, but the ratio. So for example, if he buys 11 trousers and 1 shirt, the ratio is 11:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, they are all numbers of trousers. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, perhaps I misread the question.

Let me try to parse it again.\n\nHe buys some number of trousers and shirts. The total cost is 810. He buys as many trousers as possible. So, maximum number of trousers. Then, what is the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts in that scenario.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Find maximum number of trousers (T) he can buy with 810. T = floor(810/70) = 11 (since 70*11=770, which is under 810, but 70*12=840 which is over).\n\n2. Subtract the cost of T trousers from total: 810 - (70*T) = 810-770=40.\n\n3. With 40, how many shirts (S) can he buy? S = 40//30 = 1. So S=1.\n\n4. So ratio T:S is 11:1.\n\nSo the ratio is 11:1.

So the ratio is 11:1.\n\nBut the options given are only the number of trousers, not the ratio. So perhaps the options are not correctly presented, but assuming that the correct answer is E)11 Trousers, which would correspond to the maximum number, then that's the answer.\n\nWait, but why is the question about the ratio and the options are the number of trousers? That doesn't make sense. Unless the ratio is in the options, but the options don't show that.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is actually asking for the maximum number of trousers, which is 11, so the answer is E. But the phrasing is about the ratio. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is worded incorrectly, and it's asking for the number of shirts, but that doesn't fit the options either.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the maximum number of trousers. Let's recalculate.\n\n70 * T <= 810.\n\nT = 810 //70.\n\nCalculate 70*11 = 770.\n\n70*12=840>810.\n\nSo T=11.\n\nRemaining money: 810-770=40.\n\nShirts: 40 //30 =1.\n\nSo 1 shirt.\n\nSo the ratio is 11:1.\n\nSo if the options are the ratio, but the options are numbers, perhaps the correct option is E, 11, as that's the number of trousers.\n\nSo the answer is E.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of trousers a man can purchase with 810 rupees, given that each trouser costs 70 rupees and each shirt costs 30 rupees. The goal is to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is bought.\n\n1. **Calculate the maximum number of trousers**:  \n   Each trouser costs 70 rupees. Dividing the total amount (810) by the cost of one trouser (70) gives:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{810}{70} = 11.57\n   \\]  \n   Since the man cannot buy a fraction of a trouser, the maximum number of trousers he can buy is 11.\n\n2. **Calculate the remaining money after buying trousers**:  \n   The cost of 11 trousers is:  \n   \\[\n   11 \\times 70 = 770 \\, \\text{rupees}\n   \\]  \n   Subtracting this from the total amount gives the remaining money:  \n   \\[\n   810 - 770 = 40 \\, \\text{rupees}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of shirts that can be bought with the remaining money**:  \n   Each shirt costs 30 rupees. Dividing the remaining money (40) by the cost of one shirt (30) gives:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{40}{30} = 1.33\n   \\]  \n   Since the man cannot buy a fraction of a shirt, he can buy 1 shirt.\n\n4. **Determine the ratio of trousers to shirts**:  \n   With 11 trousers and 1 shirt, the ratio is:  \n   \\[\n   11:1\n   \\]\n\n5. **Interpret the options**:  \n   The question asks for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. However, the options only provide the number of trousers. Since the maximum number of trousers is 11, the correct answer corresponds to **option E**.\n\nAnswer: E",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let's see what it says. A man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. The trousers cost 70 each and shirts are 30 each. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are A to E, each with a number of trousers.\n\nHmm, so I think the key here is to find the maximum number of trousers he can buy without exceeding the total amount of 810 rupees. Once I find that number, I can figure out how many shirts he buys and then find the ratio.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure I understand. He's buying both trousers and shirts, right? So he's not buying only trousers. Oh, but we're supposed to find the ratio when he buys the maximum number of trousers possible. So he has to buy at least one shirt as well, because otherwise, if he buys all trousers, that might be a possibility, but maybe the problem assumes that he buys both. Or does it?\n\nWait, the problem doesn't specify that he buys both. So perhaps he could buy all trousers if that's possible. Let me check that.\n\nSo, if he buys only trousers, how many can he get? Each trouser is 70. So 810 divided by 70. Let me calculate that. 70 times 11 is 770, which is less than 810. 70 times 12 is 840, which is more than 810. So 11 would be the maximum number of trousers if he buys only them. But wait, 70 *11 is 770, leaving 40 rupees. But shirts are 30 each. So with 40, he can't buy a shirt because 30 would fit, but 10 would be left. But wait, the problem says he buys both. Or does it?\n\nWait, the problem says he buys trousers and shirts. So he must buy at least one of each. So he can't buy all 11 trousers because that would mean he doesn't buy any shirts. So, in that case, the maximum number of trousers he can buy is 11 minus one, but that's not correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no. Because if he buys 11 trousers, that's 770, and he has 40 left. But he needs to buy at least one shirt. So 30 for a shirt, which would leave 10, but he can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So 11 trousers plus 1 shirt would cost 770 +30=800, leaving 10. But that's allowed, right? Because the problem doesn't say he has to spend all the money. He just spends 810 in total. So he can spend exactly 810, but in this case, 11 trousers and 1 shirt would cost 800, leaving 10 unspent. But that's not a problem. So wait, no, the total has to be exactly 810, right?\n\nWait, the problem says he spends 810 in buying them. So he must spend exactly 810. So in that case, buying 11 trousers and 1 shirt would cost 800, which is under 810. So that's not possible because he's only spent 800. So he can't do that. So he needs to buy a combination where 70*t +30*s =810, where t is the number of trousers and s the number of shirts. And we need to maximize t.\n\nSo, the approach is to find the maximum t such that 70*t +30*s =810, where s is a non-negative integer.\n\nAlternatively, since 70 and 30 have a common factor, maybe I can simplify the equation. Let's see: 70t +30s =810. Dividing both sides by 10: 7t +3s =81.\n\nSo now, we have 7t +3s =81. We need to find the maximum t such that s is an integer and >=0.\n\nSo let's solve for s: s = (81 -7t)/3. For s to be an integer, (81-7t) must be divisible by 3.\n\nWhat's 81 divided by 3? 27. So 81 is a multiple of 3. So 7t must also be a multiple of 3 because 81 minus 7t must be a multiple of 3. So 7t mod 3 should be 0.\n\nBut 7 mod 3 is 1. So 7t mod 3 is (1*t) mod 3. So t mod 3 must be 0. So t must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo t can be 0,3,6,9, etc. But we are to find the maximum t.\n\nSo let's try the largest possible t which is <=81/7. Let's compute 81/7: that's about 11.57. So the maximum t possible is 11. But t must be a multiple of 3, so the possible t values are 0,3,6,9,12. But 12*7=84>81, so 9 is the next. Wait, 11 is not a multiple of 3. So the maximum t would be 9, perhaps.\n\nWait, let's test t=9. Then s=(81-63)/3=18/3=6. So 9+6=15 items. That works, 70*9=630, 30*6=180, total 810. So yes, that works.\n\nBut wait, what about t=10? Let's see. t=10: 7*10=70. 81-70=11. 11 divided by 3 is 3.666, which is not integer. So s is not an integer. So t=10 is not possible.\n\nt=11: 7*11=77. 81-77=4. 4/3 is not integer. So s would be 1.333, which is invalid.\n\nt=8: 7*8=56. 81-56=25. 25/3 is 8.333. Not integer.\n\nt=7: 7*7=49. 81-49=32. 32/3 is about 10.666. Not integer.\n\nt=6: 7*6=42. 81-42=39. 39/3=13. So s=13. So t=6, s=13. So that's a possible solution, but t=9 is higher.\n\nSo the maximum t is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but wait. What about t=12? 7*12=84, which is over 81. So no. So 9 is the maximum.\n\nSo the ratio of trousers to shirts would be 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nBut the question is asking for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the maximum number of trousers is 9, which gives 9 trousers and 6 shirts. So the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2.\n\nBut looking at the options, the options are only the number of trousers. The options are A)9, B)8, etc. So the correct answer is A)9.\n\nWait, but wait. I thought the problem was about the ratio, but the options are only the number of trousers. So the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So perhaps the ratio is the ratio of the number of trousers to the number of shirts, which is 9:6. But the options are just the number of trousers. So perhaps the question is actually asking for the number of trousers, not the ratio. Because the options are A)9, etc.\n\nWait, the question is phrased a bit confusingly. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Question: A man spend 810 in buying trouser at Rs 70 each and shirt at 30 each. What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\"\n\nHmm. So the ratio is the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers.\n\nSo the maximum number of trousers is 9, as we found, with 6 shirts. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nBut the options are the number of trousers, not the ratio.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these kinds of ratio problems. But I'll try to think it through step by step.\n\nThe question says a man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. Trousers cost 70 each and shirts are 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are given from A to E, each with a different number of trousers.\n\nWait, so the main point is to maximize the number of trousers he buys without exceeding his total budget of 810 rupees. Once I find that maximum number, I can figure out how many shirts he bought alongside, and then determine the ratio.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. The total cost equation would be 70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nBut since he wants to maximize T, I need to find the largest possible integer value of T such that the remaining money can buy some number of shirts (S must also be an integer).\n\nSo, first, let's find the maximum possible T without exceeding 810. The cost of each trouser is 70, so 810 divided by 70 gives the maximum possible T if all money was spent on trousers.\n\nCalculating that: 810 / 70 equals approximately 11.57. Since he can't buy a fraction of a trouser, the maximum T is 11. But wait, I should check if 11 trousers fit into the budget.\n\nLet's compute the cost for 11 trousers: 11 *70 = 770. Then the remaining money is 810 - 770 = 40. Now, can 40 buy shirts at 30 each? 40 divided by 30 is about 1.333, so S would be 1. So 11 trousers and 1 shirt. But wait, that's only 70*11 + 30*1 = 770 +30=800. Oh wait, that leaves 10 rupees unused. Hmm, but the question says he spends 810, so maybe he can't have leftover money. Or maybe the problem allows for that, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-calculate. 11*70 is 770. 810 -770 is 40. 40 divided by 30 is 1.333, so S would have to be 1, but then 70*11 +30*1=770+30=800, which is less than 810. So that's a problem because he's only spent 800, not 810. So maybe 11 is too high because he can't use the remaining 40 to buy a second shirt (since 30*2=60, which is more than 40). So perhaps 11 isn't possible because he can't spend all 810. \n\nWait, that's a problem. So maybe the maximum T is less than 11. Let me try T=10.\n\n10*70=700. Remaining money is 810-700=110. Now, 110 divided by 30 is about 3.666, so S can be 3, since 3 shirts would cost 90, leaving 20 unused. But wait, 700 +90=790, which is still under 810. Hmm, but maybe 3 shirts would be the maximum possible here. Alternatively, maybe I should find S such that 30*S = 810 -70*T, and S must be an integer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model this as an equation where 70*T +30*S =810, and find T and S as integers, with T as large as possible.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation. Let's write 70T +30S =810. I can divide the entire equation by 10 to simplify: 7T +3S =81.\n\nSo, 7T +3S =81. We need to find integers T and S where T is as large as possible.\n\nLet me think of possible T values starting from the maximum possible and work downwards until I find a valid S.\n\nThe maximum possible T when all money is spent on trousers is 810/70 \u224811.57, so T=11. Let's try T=11.\n\n7*11 =77. So 77 +3S=81 \u2192 3S=4 \u2192 S=4/3, which is about 1.333. That's not an integer, so T=11 is not possible because S would not be an integer. So the next possible T is 10.\n\nT=10: 7*10=70. 70 +3S=81 \u21923S=11 \u2192 S=11/3\u22483.666. Again, not integer.\n\nNext, T=9: 7*9=63. 63 +3S=81 \u21923S=18 \u2192 S=6. That's an integer. So T=9, S=6. So that's a possible solution.\n\nBut wait, is there a higher T that works? Because we started from T=11 and went down. Let's see.\n\nWait, what about T=12? Oh, wait, 12 would require 70*12=840, which is more than 810. So no, T can't be 12.\n\nWait, so the next possible T after 9 would be 10, which we saw didn't work. So perhaps the maximum T is 9.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried T=10, 7*10=70, 3S=11, which is 3.666, which isn't allowed. So T=9 is the next possible. So the maximum T is 9.\n\nWait, but let me check for T=8.\n\nT=8: 7*8=56. 56+3S=81 \u21923S=25 \u2192 S=25/3\u22488.333. Not integer.\n\nT=7: 7*7=49. 49+3S=81 \u21923S=32 \u2192 S=32/3\u224810.666. Not integer.\n\nSo the only T that works so far is T=9, which gives S=6. So the ratio of T:S is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I miss any other T between 9 and 11 that could work?\n\nWait, T=10 didn't work because S was not integer. T=11 also didn't work. So the next possible T is 9.\n\nBut wait, let's think again. What if I adjust T and S to find the maximum T that allows 3S to be an integer and 7T +3S=81.\n\nSo, perhaps I can represent 3S=81-7T. So 81-7T must be divisible by 3, and positive.\n\nSo, 81 mod 3 is 0. 7T mod 3 is (since 7 mod3 is 1) same as T mod3.\n\nSo, 81-7T must be divisible by 3. So 0 - (T mod3) must be 0 mod3. So T mod3 must be 0. So T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo possible T's are 9,6,3,0. Let's check these.\n\nT=9: 7*9=63. 81-63=18 \u21923S=18 \u2192 S=6. Valid.\n\nT=6: 7*6=42. 81-42=39 \u21923S=39 \u2192 S=13. Valid.\n\nT=3: 7*3=21. 81-21=60 \u21923S=60 \u2192 S=20. Valid.\n\nT=0: 0+3S=81 \u2192 S=27. Valid, but that's not buying any trousers.\n\nSo the maximum T that is a multiple of 3 is 9. So he can buy 9 trousers and 6 shirts. That's the maximum possible number of trousers.\n\nSo the ratio is T:S =9:6 \u2192 which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the ratio when maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the answer is 9:6, but the options are given as the number of trousers. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA)9 Trousers\n\nB)8\n\nC)10\n\nD)7\n\nE)11\n\nWait, the options are just the number of trousers, but the question is phrased as \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So perhaps the question expects the ratio of the numbers, but the options only give the number of trousers, so perhaps the correct answer is A)9.\n\nWait, but the options are labeled as A)9 Trousers, etc. So perhaps the question is asking what is the maximum number of trousers, and the ratio is just the number of trousers to shirts, which would be 9:6, but the options only show the number of trousers.\n\nWait, the question says \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So the ratio is T:S, and the options are possible numbers of T. So the answer would be 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me make sure I didn't miss any possible higher T.\n\nWait, earlier I thought T=9 is the maximum, but let me check again. Suppose T=10. Then 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3 with a remainder of 20. So he could buy 3 shirts, spending 90, leaving 20, which he can't spend on a shirt. So that's not allowed because he can't spend all 810. So T=10 is invalid because he can't buy a fractional shirt.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he can buy 3 shirts and have 20 left, but that would mean he didn't spend all the money, which the problem might not allow. So T=10 isn't possible. Therefore, the maximum T is 9, with 6 shirts, and the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2. But the options are the number of trousers. So the correct answer is 9, which is option A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these kinds of ratio problems. But I'll try to think it through step by step.\n\nThe question says a man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. Trousers cost 70 each and shirts are 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are given from A to E, each with a different number of trousers.\n\nWait, so the main point is to maximize the number of trousers he buys without exceeding his total budget of 810 rupees. Once I find that maximum number, I can figure out how many shirts he bought alongside, and then determine the ratio.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. The total cost equation would be 70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nBut since he wants to maximize T, I need to find the largest possible integer value of T such that the remaining money can buy some number of shirts (S must also be an integer).\n\nSo, first, let's find the maximum possible T without exceeding 810. The cost of each trouser is 70, so 810 divided by 70 gives the maximum possible T if all money was spent on trousers.\n\nCalculating that: 810 / 70 equals approximately 11.57. Since he can't buy a fraction of a trouser, the maximum T is 11. But wait, I should check if 11 trousers fit into the budget.\n\nLet's compute the cost for 11 trousers: 11 *70 = 770. Then the remaining money is 810 - 770 = 40. Now, can 40 buy shirts at 30 each? 40 divided by 30 is about 1.333, so S would be 1. So 11 trousers and 1 shirt. But wait, that's only 70*11 + 30*1 = 770 +30=800. Oh wait, that leaves 10 rupees unused. Hmm, but the question says he spends 810, so maybe he can't have leftover money. Or maybe the problem allows for that, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-calculate. 11*70 is 770. 810 -770 is 40. 40 divided by 30 is 1.333, so S would have to be 1, but then 70*11 +30*1=770+30=800, which is less than 810. So that's a problem because he's only spent 800, not 810. So maybe 11 is too high because he can't use the remaining 40 to buy a second shirt (since 30*2=60, which is more than 40). So perhaps 11 isn't possible because he can't spend all 810. \n\nWait, that's a problem. So maybe the maximum T is less than 11. Let me try T=10.\n\n10*70=700. Remaining money is 810-700=110. Now, 110 divided by 30 is about 3.666, so S can be 3, since 3 shirts would cost 90, leaving 20 unused. But wait, 700 +90=790, which is still under 810. Hmm, but maybe 3 shirts would be the maximum possible here. Alternatively, maybe I should find S such that 30*S = 810 -70*T, and S must be an integer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model this as an equation where 70*T +30*S =810, and find T and S as integers, with T as large as possible.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation. Let's write 70T +30S =810. I can divide the entire equation by 10 to simplify: 7T +3S =81.\n\nSo, 7T +3S =81. We need to find integers T and S where T is as large as possible.\n\nLet me think of possible T values starting from the maximum possible and work downwards until I find a valid S.\n\nThe maximum possible T when all money is spent on trousers is 810/70 \u224811.57, so T=11. Let's try T=11.\n\n7*11 =77. So 77 +3S=81 \u2192 3S=4 \u2192 S=4/3, which is about 1.333. That's not an integer, so T=11 is not possible because S would not be an integer. So the next possible T is 10.\n\nT=10: 7*10=70. 70 +3S=81 \u21923S=11 \u2192 S=11/3\u22483.666. Again, not integer.\n\nNext, T=9: 7*9=63. 63 +3S=81 \u21923S=18 \u2192 S=6. That's an integer. So T=9, S=6. So that's a possible solution.\n\nBut wait, is there a higher T that works? Because we started from T=11 and went down. Let's see.\n\nWait, what about T=12? Oh, wait, 12 would require 70*12=840, which is more than 810. So no, T can't be 12.\n\nWait, so the next possible T after 9 would be 10, which we saw didn't work. So perhaps the maximum T is 9.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried T=10, 7*10=70, 3S=11, which is 3.666, which isn't allowed. So T=9 is the next possible. So the maximum T is 9.\n\nWait, but let me check for T=8.\n\nT=8: 7*8=56. 56+3S=81 \u21923S=25 \u2192 S=25/3\u22488.333. Not integer.\n\nT=7: 7*7=49. 49+3S=81 \u21923S=32 \u2192 S=32/3\u224810.666.

Did I miss any other T between 9 and 11 that could work?\n\nWait, T=10 didn't work because S was not integer. T=11 also didn't work. So the next possible T is 9.\n\nBut wait, let's think again. What if I adjust T and S to find the maximum T that allows 3S to be an integer and 7T +3S=81.\n\nSo, perhaps I can represent 3S=81-7T. So 81-7T must be divisible by 3, and positive.\n\nSo, 81 mod 3 is 0. 7T mod 3 is (since 7 mod3 is 1) same as T mod3.\n\nSo, 81-7T must be divisible by 3. So 0 - (T mod3) must be 0 mod3. So T mod3 must be 0. So T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo possible T's are 9,6,3,0. Let's check these.\n\nT=9: 7*9=63. 81-63=18 \u21923S=18 \u2192 S=6.

Valid, but that's not buying any trousers.\n\nSo the maximum T that is a multiple of 3 is 9. So he can buy 9 trousers and 6 shirts. That's the maximum possible number of trousers.\n\nSo the ratio is T:S =9:6 \u2192 which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the ratio when maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the answer is 9:6, but the options are given as the number of trousers.

Then 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3 with a remainder of 20. So he could buy 3 shirts, spending 90, leaving 20, which he can't spend on a shirt.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where a man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. Each trouser costs 70 rupees and each shirt is 30 rupees. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options given are from A to E, each representing a certain number of trousers.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this. So, the man is trying to buy as many trousers as possible with his 810 rupees. But he's also buying shirts, so we need to figure out how many of each he can get without exceeding his budget.\n\nWait, the problem says the maximum number of trousers. So, I guess he should buy as many trousers as possible, and whatever money is left, he uses to buy shirts. That makes sense because each trouser is more expensive than a shirt, so buying more trousers would mean fewer shirts but maximizing the number of trousers.\n\nLet me outline the variables. Let's say he buys 't' number of trousers and 's' number of shirts. So, the total cost equation would be 70t + 30s = 810.\n\nBut since he's buying the maximum number of trousers, we can assume he spends as much as possible on trousers. So, the maximum t he can buy is when he spends all his money on trousers. Let's check that.\n\nIf he buys all trousers, the cost would be 70t = 810. So, t = 810 / 70. Let me calculate that. 70 times 11 is 770, because 70*10=700 and 70*11=770. 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So 810 divided by 70 is 11.571... So he can't buy 12 because that's over. So the maximum number of trousers he can buy is 11, but wait, that's not possible because 70*11=770, leaving 810-770=40 rupees. 40 isn't enough for a shirt because each shirt is 30. Wait, 40 is more than 30. Oh, wait no, 40 is more than 30. So 40 can buy one shirt because 30 is the cost, leaving 10, which isn't enough for another shirt. So in that case, he can buy 11 trousers and 1 shirt. That's possible, right?\n\nBut wait, the options don't have 11 as the correct answer for the ratio. Let me check the options again. The options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11. Oh, E is 11, so that's an option.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If he buys 11 trousers, that's 770, then 810-770=40. He can buy one shirt (30), leaving 10. So total is 11 trousers and 1 shirt. So the ratio is 11:1.\n\nBut wait, the question says the ratio of trousers to shirts when maximum number of trousers is purchased. So 11:1 would be the ratio. But looking at the options, E is 11, but the question is about the ratio. Wait, the options are giving the number of trousers, but the question asks for the ratio of trousers to shirts. Hmm, but the options are only giving numbers, not the ratio. Wait, let me read the question again.\n\nThe question says, \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So the ratio is Trousers:Shirts. And the options are options of the number of Trousers, but the answer must be the ratio. Wait, perhaps the options are not the ratio, but the number of Trousers, and the question is a bit ambiguous. Wait, the way the options are presented, it's A)9 Trousers, etc. So each option is a possible number of Trousers, but the question is about the ratio of Trousers to shirts. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, no, maybe the options are the possible ratio options. But looking again, the options are A to E, each with a number followed by 'Trousers'. So the options are for the number of Trousers, but the question is about the ratio of Trousers to shirts. Hmm, perhaps I misread the question. Let me read it again.\n\nAh, the question is: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So, the ratio is the number of Trousers to the number of shirts. So, for example, if he buys 9 trousers and 3 shirts, the ratio is 3:1, but that's just an example.\n\nSo, to find this ratio, we need to find the maximum number of Trousers he can buy, which would be when the remaining money is used to buy shirts.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 11 trousers cost 770, leaving 40. 40 can buy one shirt (30) and have 10 left. So 11 Trousers and 1 shirt. So ratio is 11:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, option E is 11 Trousers. So perhaps the answer is E, but the question is about the ratio. Wait, perhaps the options are giving the number of Trousers, but the question is about the ratio. So perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are giving the ratio of Trousers to shirts, but in the options, it's written as a number of Trousers, but that doesn't make sense. Because the ratio would be a pair of numbers. So perhaps the options are the number of Trousers, and the corresponding number of shirts is derived from the ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach.\n\nWe need to maximize the number of Trousers, so find the maximum t such that 70t +30s =810, where t and s are integers >=0.\n\nSo, 70t must be <=810. So t_max = floor(810/70) = 11, because 70*11=770, which is less than 810. 70*12=840>810.\n\nSo, t=11, then the remaining money is 810-770=40. 40/30 = 1.333, so s=1, with 10 left over.\n\nSo, the ratio is 11:1. So the ratio is 11:1. So the number of Trousers is 11, and shirts is 1.\n\nBut the options are A)9, B)8, etc., so E is 11 Trousers. So if the question is about the number of Trousers when maximum is purchased, the answer would be E. But the question is about the ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are not the number of Trousers, but the ratio. Wait, the way the options are written: A)9 Trousers, B)8 Trousers... So each option is the number of Trousers, but the question is about the ratio. So perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Maybe the question is, when maximum number of Trousers is bought, what is the ratio of Trousers to shirts. So the answer would be 11:1.\n\nBut the options are giving numbers, not ratios. So perhaps the options are not correctly presented, but let me look again.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are in the form of possible ratios, but written as the number of Trousers, but that seems unlikely. Because a ratio would be something like 3:1, not just 3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are the possible ratios, but presented as the number of Trousers. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think again.\n\nThe problem is: He spends 810 on Trousers and shirts. Max Trousers. So t is as large as possible.\n\nt=11, s=1. So ratio t:s is 11:1.\n\nSo, the ratio is 11:1.\n\nBut the options are A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. So perhaps the options are not the ratio, but the number of Trousers, but the question is about the ratio. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but I must have made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that when he buys maximum Trousers, the remaining money isn't enough for another Trousers, but could buy some shirts. So the ratio is t/s.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach. Maybe the maximum number of Trousers he can buy is when the remaining amount can be exactly divided by the shirt's cost. So, 810 -70t must be divisible by 30.\n\nSo, 810 -70t = 30s.\n\nWe can write this as 70t +30s =810.\n\nDivide both sides by 10: 7t +3s=81.\n\nSo, 7t +3s =81.\n\nWe need to find integer solutions for t and s, with t as large as possible.\n\nSo, t can be as large as possible such that 7t <=81. So t_max is floor(81/7)=11.571, so t=11.\n\nThen, s=(81-7*11)/3 = (81-77)/3=4/3. But 4/3 is not an integer, which is a problem because s must be an integer.\n\nAh, so t=11 is not possible because s would be 1.333, which isn't allowed. So we need to decrease t until s becomes an integer.\n\nSo, let's try t=11: s=(81-77)/3=4/3 \u2192 not integer.\n\nt=10: 7*10=70 \u2192 81-70=11 \u2192 11/3=3.666 \u2192 not integer.\n\nt=9: 7*9=63 \u2192 81-63=18 \u219218/3=6 \u2192 s=6. So this works.\n\nSo, when t=9, s=6. So ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought t=11, s=1. But that gives s=1.333 when t=11, which isn't allowed. So the maximum t where s is integer is t=9.\n\nWait, that's a different conclusion. So I think I made a mistake earlier. Because the total money must be exactly 810, so 70t +30s must equal 810 exactly. So 70t +30s=810 \u2192 7t +3s=81.\n\nSo for t to be maximum, we need to find the largest t where (81 -7t) is divisible by 3.\n\nSo, let's compute for t from 11 down:\n\nt=11 \u2192 81-77=4 \u2192 4/3 is not integer. So invalid.\n\nt=10 \u2192 81-70=11 \u2192 11/3 \u22483.666 \u2192 invalid.\n\nt=9 \u219281-63=18 \u219218/3=6 \u2192 valid.\n\nSo t=9, s=6.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6 \u2192 which simplifies to 3:2. So the ratio of Trousers to shirts is 3:2.\n\nWait, but the options are about the number of Trousers. So when maximum Trousers is bought, t=9. So the number of Trousers is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought t=11, but that doesn't give an integer s. So perhaps the correct approach is to find t as maximum where (81-7t) is divisible by 3.\n\nSo, 7t must be <=81.\n\nt=9 \u21927*9=63 \u219281-63=18 \u219218/3=6 \u2192 valid.\n\nt=10 \u219270 \u219281-70=11 \u219211/3 is not integer.\n\nt=11 \u219277 \u219281-77=4 \u21924/3 invalid.\n\nSo the maximum t is 9, with s=6. So the ratio is 9:6 \u2192 simplifies to 3:2.\n\nSo the ratio is 3:2, but the question is asking for the ratio when maximum Trousers are bought. So the number of Trousers is 9, so the correct option is A)9 Trousers.\n\nWait, but the options are just the number of Trousers. So the question is, when maximum Trousers are bought, what is the ratio? So the ratio would be 9:6 \u21923:2.\n\nBut the options are only the number of Trousers. So perhaps the question is actually asking for the number of Trousers when maximum is bought, which is 9, so option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the ratio of Trousers to shirts, so 9:6 or 3:2. But the options are not given as ratios, but as numbers, so perhaps the question is just asking for the number of Trousers.\n\nWait, the question says, \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So the ratio is Trousers : shirts.\n\nIn this case, it's 9:6 \u21923:2. But the options are giving numbers for Trousers. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options. Alternatively, perhaps the options are the possible ratios expressed as the number of Trousers, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are the possible ratios expressed as the number of Trousers, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Let me re-read the question.\n\nQuestion: A man spend 810 in buying trouser at Rs 70 each and shirt at 30 each. What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\n\nSo the ratio is Trousers : shirts. So the possible answers would be presented as a ratio, but the options are presented as numbers of Trousers. So perhaps the options are not correctly presented, but assuming that the correct number of Trousers is 9, the answer would be option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that when he buys the maximum number of Trousers, the number of shirts is 6, so the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. So the ratio is 3:2, but the options don't present this.\n\nWait, but the options are A to E, each giving a number of Trousers. So perhaps the question is actually asking for the number of Trousers, not the ratio. Because the options only give numbers of Trousers.\n\nSo, in that case, the maximum number of Trousers he can buy is 9, because 11 doesn't give an integer number of shirts. So the correct answer is option A)9 Trousers.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation for t=11 gives s=1.333, which is not allowed, so the next possible is t=9, s=6.\n\nSo, the number of Trousers is 9, so the correct option is A.\n\nSo, the answer is A)9 Trousers.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here where a man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. Each trouser costs 70 rupees and each shirt is 30 rupees. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options given are from A to E, each representing a certain number of trousers.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this. So, the man is trying to buy as many trousers as possible with his 810 rupees. But he's also buying shirts, so we need to figure out how many of each he can get without exceeding his budget.\n\nWait, the problem says the maximum number of trousers. So, I guess he should buy as many trousers as possible, and whatever money is left, he uses to buy shirts. That makes sense because each trouser is more expensive than a shirt, so buying more trousers would mean fewer shirts but maximizing the number of trousers.\n\nLet me outline the variables. Let's say he buys 't' number of trousers and 's' number of shirts. So, the total cost equation would be 70t + 30s = 810.\n\nBut since he's buying the maximum number of trousers, we can assume he spends as much as possible on trousers. So, the maximum t he can buy is when he spends all his money on trousers. Let's check that.\n\nIf he buys all trousers, the cost would be 70t = 810. So, t = 810 / 70. Let me calculate that. 70 times 11 is 770, because 70*10=700 and 70*11=770. 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So 810 divided by 70 is 11.571... So he can't buy 12 because that's over. So the maximum number of trousers he can buy is 11, but wait, that's not possible because 70*11=770, leaving 810-770=40 rupees. 40 isn't enough for a shirt because each shirt is 30. Wait, 40 is more than 30. Oh, wait no, 40 is more than 30. So 40 can buy one shirt because 30 is the cost, leaving 10, which isn't enough for another shirt. So in that case, he can buy 11 trousers and 1 shirt. That's possible, right?\n\nBut wait, the options don't have 11 as the correct answer for the ratio. Let me check the options again. The options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11. Oh, E is 11, so that's an option.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If he buys 11 trousers, that's 770, then 810-770=40. He can buy one shirt (30), leaving 10. So total is 11 trousers and 1 shirt. So the ratio is 11:1.\n\nBut wait, the question says the ratio of trousers to shirts when maximum number of trousers is purchased. So 11:1 would be the ratio. But looking at the options, E is 11, but the question is about the ratio. Wait, the options are giving the number of trousers, but the question asks for the ratio of trousers to shirts. Hmm, but the options are only giving numbers, not the ratio. Wait, let me read the question again.\n\nThe question says, \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So the ratio is Trousers:Shirts. And the options are options of the number of Trousers, but the answer must be the ratio. Wait, perhaps the options are not the ratio, but the number of Trousers, and the question is a bit ambiguous. Wait, the way the options are presented, it's A)9 Trousers, etc. So each option is a possible number of Trousers, but the question is about the ratio of Trousers to shirts. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, no, maybe the options are the possible ratio options. But looking again, the options are A to E, each with a number followed by 'Trousers'. So the options are for the number of Trousers, but the question is about the ratio of Trousers to shirts. Hmm, perhaps I misread the question. Let me read it again.\n\nAh, the question is: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So, the ratio is the number of Trousers to the number of shirts. So, for example, if he buys 9 trousers and 3 shirts, the ratio is 3:1, but that's just an example.\n\nSo, to find this ratio, we need to find the maximum number of Trousers he can buy, which would be when the remaining money is used to buy shirts.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 11 trousers cost 770, leaving 40. 40 can buy one shirt (30) and have 10 left. So 11 Trousers and 1 shirt. So ratio is 11:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, option E is 11 Trousers. So perhaps the answer is E, but the question is about the ratio. Wait, perhaps the options are giving the number of Trousers, but the question is about the ratio. So perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are giving the ratio of Trousers to shirts, but in the options, it's written as a number of Trousers, but that doesn't make sense. Because the ratio would be a pair of numbers. So perhaps the options are the number of Trousers, and the corresponding number of shirts is derived from the ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach.\n\nWe need to maximize the number of Trousers, so find the maximum t such that 70t +30s =810, where t and s are integers >=0.\n\nSo, 70t must be <=810. So t_max = floor(810/70) = 11, because 70*11=770, which is less than 810. 70*12=840>810.\n\nSo, t=11, then the remaining money is 810-770=40. 40/30 = 1.333, so s=1, with 10 left over.\n\nSo, the ratio is 11:1. So the ratio is 11:1. So the number of Trousers is 11, and shirts is 1.\n\nBut the options are A)9, B)8, etc., so E is 11 Trousers. So if the question is about the number of Trousers when maximum is purchased, the answer would be E. But the question is about the ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are not the number of Trousers, but the ratio. Wait, the way the options are written: A)9 Trousers, B)8 Trousers... So each option is the number of Trousers, but the question is about the ratio. So perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Maybe the question is, when maximum number of Trousers is bought, what is the ratio of Trousers to shirts. So the answer would be 11:1.\n\nBut the options are giving numbers, not ratios.

Because a ratio would be something like 3:1, not just 3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are the possible ratios, but presented as the number of Trousers. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think again.\n\nThe problem is: He spends 810 on Trousers and shirts. Max Trousers. So t is as large as possible.\n\nt=11, s=1. So ratio t:s is 11:1.\n\nSo, the ratio is 11:1.\n\nBut the options are A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. So perhaps the options are not the ratio, but the number of Trousers, but the question is about the ratio. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but I must have made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that when he buys maximum Trousers, the remaining money isn't enough for another Trousers, but could buy some shirts. So the ratio is t/s.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach. Maybe the maximum number of Trousers he can buy is when the remaining amount can be exactly divided by the shirt's cost. So, 810 -70t must be divisible by 30.\n\nSo, 810 -70t = 30s.\n\nWe can write this as 70t +30s =810.\n\nDivide both sides by 10: 7t +3s=81.\n\nSo, 7t +3s =81.\n\nWe need to find integer solutions for t and s, with t as large as possible.\n\nSo, t can be as large as possible such that 7t <=81. So t_max is floor(81/7)=11.571, so t=11.\n\nThen, s=(81-7*11)/3 = (81-77)/3=4/3. But 4/3 is not an integer, which is a problem because s must be an integer.\n\nAh, so t=11 is not possible because s would be 1.333, which isn't allowed. So we need to decrease t until s becomes an integer.\n\nSo, let's try t=11: s=(81-77)/3=4/3 \u2192 not integer.\n\nt=10: 7*10=70 \u2192 81-70=11 \u2192 11/3=3.666 \u2192 not integer.\n\nt=9: 7*9=63 \u2192 81-63=18 \u219218/3=6 \u2192 s=6. So this works.\n\nSo, when t=9, s=6. So ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought t=11, s=1. But that gives s=1.333 when t=11, which isn't allowed. So the maximum t where s is integer is t=9.\n\nWait, that's a different conclusion. So I think I made a mistake earlier. Because the total money must be exactly 810, so 70t +30s must equal 810 exactly. So 70t +30s=810 \u2192 7t +3s=81.\n\nSo for t to be maximum, we need to find the largest t where (81 -7t) is divisible by 3.\n\nSo, let's compute for t from 11 down:\n\nt=11 \u2192 81-77=4 \u2192 4/3 is not integer.

So the ratio of Trousers to shirts is 3:2.\n\nWait, but the options are about the number of Trousers. So when maximum Trousers is bought, t=9. So the number of Trousers is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought t=11, but that doesn't give an integer s. So perhaps the correct approach is to find t as maximum where (81-7t) is divisible by 3.\n\nSo, 7t must be <=81.\n\nt=9 \u21927*9=63 \u219281-63=18 \u219218/3=6 \u2192 valid.\n\nt=10 \u219270 \u219281-70=11 \u219211/3 is not integer.\n\nt=11 \u219277 \u219281-77=4 \u21924/3 invalid.\n\nSo the maximum t is 9, with s=6. So the ratio is 9:6 \u2192 simplifies to 3:2.\n\nSo the ratio is 3:2, but the question is asking for the ratio when maximum Trousers are bought. So the number of Trousers is 9, so the correct option is A)9 Trousers.\n\nWait, but the options are just the number of Trousers. So the question is, when maximum Trousers are bought, what is the ratio? So the ratio would be 9:6 \u21923:2.\n\nBut the options are only the number of Trousers.

Trousers cost 70 rupees each and shirts are 30 rupees each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are given as A)9, B)8, etc., but wait, looking again, the options seem to be labeled with the number of trousers. So the options are the possible maximum number of trousers he can buy. Hmm, but the question is a bit confusing because it says the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. Wait, but the options are just the number of trousers, not the ratio. Hmm, maybe I misread the question.\n\nWait, let me read it again. Oh wait, the options are labeled A)9 Trousers, B)8 Trousers, etc. So each option is the number of trousers, and we have to choose which one is the correct maximum number. So the question is, what's the maximum number of trousers he can buy with 810 rupees, given that he also buys shirts. So it's a problem of maximizing the number of trousers, which implies that the remaining money after buying as many trousers as possible is used to buy shirts.\n\nWait, but maybe I should think in terms of equations. Let me denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S. So the total cost is 70*T + 30*S = 810. And we want to maximize T, so we need to find the maximum integer T such that (810 -70*T) is non-negative and divisible by 30, because the remaining amount should be exactly divisible by the cost per shirt. Because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt.\n\nAlternatively, maybe not necessarily divisible, but the remaining money is used to buy shirts, so (810 -70T) must be equal to 30*S, where S is an integer. So 810 -70T must be a multiple of 30. So 70T must be equal to 810 minus a multiple of 30. Let me write that as 70T = 810 -30S. Let's rearrange it: 70T +30S =810.\n\nI can factor out 10: 10*(7T +3S) = 810 => 7T +3S =81. So now the equation is 7T +3S =81. We need to find integer values T and S such that this holds, and T is as large as possible.\n\nSo to maximize T, we need to minimize S. The smallest S can be is 0, but let's see if that's possible. If S=0, then 7T=81. T would be 81/7, which is approximately 11.57. But since T has to be an integer, the maximum possible T when S is 0 would be 11, but 7*11=77, which leaves 81-77=4. Then 3S=4, which is not possible because 4 isn't divisible by 3. So S can't be zero. Therefore, we need to find the largest T where 7T \u226481 and (81 -7T) is divisible by 3.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to find the maximum T such that (81 -7T) is non-negative and divisible by 3. Let's try to find such T.\n\nLet me think of T as starting from the maximum possible and see which is the first T that satisfies the condition.\n\nWhat's the maximum T possible? Let's compute 81 divided by 7. 7*11 is 77, 7*12=84 which is over 81. So maximum possible T is 11, but as we saw, 81-77=4, which isn't divisible by 3.\n\nNext, try T=10. 7*10=70. 81-70=11. 11 divided by 3 is not an integer. So S would be 11/3, which is not possible.\n\nT=9: 7*9=63. 81-63=18. 18 divided by 3 is 6. So S=6. That's valid. So T=9, S=6. So the ratio of trousers to shirts would be 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So we need to find the maximum T possible. So perhaps T=9 is the maximum, because when T=10, S isn't an integer, and T=11, same issue.\n\nWait, wait, let's check T=10 again. 7*10=70, so 81-70=11. 11 divided by 3 is 3 with remainder 2. So 11=3*3 +2. So S can't be 3.666. So T=10 is invalid.\n\nWait, what about T=8? 7*8=56. 81-56=25. 25/3 is about 8.333. Not integer. So no.\n\nT=7: 7*7=49. 81-49=32. 32/3 is ~10.666. Not integer.\n\nT=6: 42. 81-42=39. 39/3=13. So S=13. That's valid. But T=6 is less than 9, so not the maximum.\n\nSo the maximum T possible is 9, with S=6. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the options are about the number of trousers. So the answer would be 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Are there any other T values higher than 9 that could work?\n\nWait, what about T=12? No, because 7*12=84, which is more than 81. So not possible.\n\nWait another approach: Let's express the equation as 3S =81 -7T. So 81-7T must be a multiple of 3, positive or zero.\n\nSo 81 is already a multiple of 3 (since 8+1=9, which is divisible by 3). So 7T must also leave a remainder such that 81 -7T is a multiple of 3. \n\nWait, 7 mod 3 is 1, because 7 divided by 3 is 2 with a remainder of 1. So 7T mod3 is same as (7 mod3)*T mod3 \u2192 1*T mod3. So 7T mod3 is T mod3. \n\nSo 81 mod3 is 0. So 81 -7T mod3 must be 0. So 0 - (T mod3) must be 0 mod3 \u2192 T mod3 must be 0.\n\nSo T must be a multiple of 3. So possible T values are 9, 6, 3, 0, etc.\n\nWe're looking for the maximum T, so let's start from the highest possible T that is a multiple of 3.\n\nEarlier, we saw that T=9 is possible, because 81 -7*9=81-63=18, which is divisible by 3 (18/3=6). So S=6. So that works.\n\nWhat about T=12? As before, 7*12=84>81. No.\n\nT=15 would be way too high. So the maximum T is 9.\n\nSo the answer is 9, which is option A.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says a man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. Trousers cost 70 each and shirts are 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are A to E, each giving a number of trousers, like 9, 8, etc.\n\nWait, but the question is a bit confusing. Oh wait, I think I get it. So the man is buying as many trousers as possible with his 810 rupees, and then the remaining money is spent on shirts. Then we have to find the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts. Or wait, maybe it's the ratio of the cost per trouser to shirt? No, no, the question says the ratio of trouser and shirt when maximum number is purchased. So I think it's the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts.\n\nRight, so the first step is to find the maximum number of trousers he can buy. Each trouser costs 70. So how many can he buy with 810?\n\nLet me calculate. 810 divided by 70. Let's see, 70 times 11 is 770, which is less than 810. 70 times 12 is 840, which is more than 810. So the maximum number of trousers is 11, right? Because 11*70 = 770. That leaves 810 - 770 = 40 rupees.\n\nNow, with the remaining 40, he can buy shirts. Each shirt is 30. So 40 divided by 30 is 1 with a remainder of 10. So he can buy 1 shirt, spending 30, and have 10 left, which isn't enough for another shirt.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check that. 40 divided by 30 is 1.333. So only 1 shirt can be bought. So total shirts are 1.\n\nSo the number of trousers is 11, shirts is 1. The ratio is 11:1.\n\nBut wait, the options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11. So the options list the number of trousers, but the question is about the ratio. Oh wait, no. Wait, the options are labeled as the number of trousers. The question is asking what will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when maximum number of trouser is purchased. So the options are giving the number of trousers, and the correct answer is the number of trousers, but the ratio is to be found. Wait, no, the question is a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, the question says \"what will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So the ratio is Trousers : Shirts.\n\nBut the options are all just numbers of trousers. So perhaps the question is actually asking how many trousers are purchased when maximum possible, and that's the number given in the options. Because the options are A)9, B)8, etc., which are all possible numbers of trousers. So perhaps the correct answer is E)11, which is the maximum number of trousers.\n\nWait, but why is the question talking about the ratio then? That part is confusing. Because if the options are the number of trousers, then the answer is E)11.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts, and the options are the possible ratios. But the options are not in ratio form; they're just numbers. So that's probably not it.\n\nHmm, perhaps I misread the question. Let me read it again.\n\n\"A man spend 810 in buying trouser at Rs 70 each and shirt at 30 each. What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\"\n\nSo the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts. So after buying as many trousers as possible, the remaining money buys as many shirts as possible. Then find the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts.\n\nSo, with 810, maximum number of trousers is 11, as 11*70=770. Remaining is 40, which buys 1 shirt. So ratio is 11:1. But the options are just numbers, so perhaps the question is looking for the number of trousers, which is 11, option E.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the ratio of the cost of a trouser to a shirt. But that's fixed at 70:30, which is 7:3. But that's not one of the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reevaluate my approach. Let me set up an equation.\n\nLet x be the number of trousers, y the number of shirts.\n\n70x + 30y = 810.\n\nWe need to maximize x, so find the largest integer x such that 70x \u2264810.\n\n810 \u00f770= 11.571. So maximum x is 11.\n\nThen, with x=11, 70*11=770, so 810-770=40=30y \u2192 y=40/30=1.333. But y must be an integer, so y=1. So the ratio is 11:1.\n\nBut the options don't have 11:1. The options are A to E, each is a number of trousers. So perhaps the question is just asking for the number of trousers when maximum is bought, which is 11, so option E.\n\nSo the answer is E)11.\n\nWait, but why is the question mentioning the ratio then? Oh, perhaps it's a typo or misunderstanding. Maybe the question is phrased wrong. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the question is about the ratio of cost. For example, when you buy x trousers and y shirts, the ratio of the total cost of trousers to shirts is (70x)/(30y). But the man spends all 810, so 70x +30y=810.\n\nBut the problem states that he's buying as many trousers as possible, so x is maximum. So with x=11, y=1, then total cost for trousers is 770, shirts 30. So ratio is 770:30=77:3. Which is 77:3. But none of the options are in ratio form. So perhaps the question is not about that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the ratio of the number of items. So 11 trousers and 1 shirt, so 11:1. But the options are numbers, not ratios, so this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, the options are A)9, B)8, etc., which are numbers of trousers. So perhaps the question is just asking for the number of trousers when maximum is bought, which is 11, option E.\n\nSo I think the correct answer is E)11.\n",

To find the maximum number of trousers, divide the total amount (Rs 810) by the cost per trouser:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of trousers} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{810}{70} \\right\\rfloor = 11\n   \\]  \n   Thus, the man can buy 11 trousers, which costs:  \n   \\[\n   11 \\times 70 = 770 \\, \\text{Rs}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Remaining Money for Shirts**:  \n   After buying 11 trousers, the remaining money is:  \n   \\[\n   810 - 770 = 40 \\, \\text{Rs}\n   \\]  \n   Each shirt costs Rs 30, so the number of shirts that can be bought is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of shirts} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{30} \\right\\rfloor = 1\n   \\]\n\n3. **Ratio of Trousers to Shirts**:  \n   The ratio of the number of trousers to shirts is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Number of trousers}}{\\text{Number of shirts}} = \\frac{11}{1} = 11:1\n   \\]\n\n4. **Interpreting the Options**:  \n   The question asks for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. However, the options only provide the number of trousers. Since the maximum number of trousers is 11, the correct answer is **E) 11**.\n\nAnswer: E",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says a man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. Trousers cost 70 each and shirts are 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are A to E, each giving a number of trousers, like 9, 8, etc.\n\nWait, but the question is a bit confusing. Oh wait, I think I get it. So the man is buying as many trousers as possible with his 810 rupees, and then the remaining money is spent on shirts. Then we have to find the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts. Or wait, maybe it's the ratio of the cost per trouser to shirt? No, no, the question says the ratio of trouser and shirt when maximum number is purchased. So I think it's the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts.\n\nRight, so the first step is to find the maximum number of trousers he can buy. Each trouser costs 70. So how many can he buy with 810?\n\nLet me calculate. 810 divided by 70. Let's see, 70 times 11 is 770, which is less than 810. 70 times 12 is 840, which is more than 810. So the maximum number of trousers is 11, right? Because 11*70 = 770. That leaves 810 - 770 = 40 rupees.\n\nNow, with the remaining 40, he can buy shirts. Each shirt is 30. So 40 divided by 30 is 1 with a remainder of 10. So he can buy 1 shirt, spending 30, and have 10 left, which isn't enough for another shirt.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check that. 40 divided by 30 is 1.333. So only 1 shirt can be bought. So total shirts are 1.\n\nSo the number of trousers is 11, shirts is 1. The ratio is 11:1.\n\nBut wait, the options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11. So the options list the number of trousers, but the question is about the ratio. Oh wait, no. Wait, the options are labeled as the number of trousers. The question is asking what will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when maximum number of trouser is purchased. So the options are giving the number of trousers, and the correct answer is the number of trousers, but the ratio is to be found. Wait, no, the question is a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, the question says \"what will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So the ratio is Trousers : Shirts.\n\nBut the options are all just numbers of trousers. So perhaps the question is actually asking how many trousers are purchased when maximum possible, and that's the number given in the options. Because the options are A)9, B)8, etc., which are all possible numbers of trousers. So perhaps the correct answer is E)11, which is the maximum number of trousers.\n\nWait, but why is the question talking about the ratio then? That part is confusing. Because if the options are the number of trousers, then the answer is E)11.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts, and the options are the possible ratios. But the options are not in ratio form; they're just numbers. So that's probably not it.\n\nHmm, perhaps I misread the question. Let me read it again.\n\n\"A man spend 810 in buying trouser at Rs 70 each and shirt at 30 each. What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\"\n\nSo the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts. So after buying as many trousers as possible, the remaining money buys as many shirts as possible. Then find the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts.\n\nSo, with 810, maximum number of trousers is 11, as 11*70=770. Remaining is 40, which buys 1 shirt. So ratio is 11:1. But the options are just numbers, so perhaps the question is looking for the number of trousers, which is 11, option E.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the ratio of the cost of a trouser to a shirt. But that's fixed at 70:30, which is 7:3. But that's not one of the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reevaluate my approach. Let me set up an equation.\n\nLet x be the number of trousers, y the number of shirts.\n\n70x + 30y = 810.\n\nWe need to maximize x, so find the largest integer x such that 70x \u2264810.\n\n810 \u00f770= 11.571. So maximum x is 11.\n\nThen, with x=11, 70*11=770, so 810-770=40=30y \u2192 y=40/30=1.333. But y must be an integer, so y=1. So the ratio is 11:1.\n\nBut the options don't have 11:1. The options are A to E, each is a number of trousers. So perhaps the question is just asking for the number of trousers when maximum is bought, which is 11, so option E.\n\nSo the answer is E)11.\n\nWait, but why is the question mentioning the ratio then? Oh, perhaps it's a typo or misunderstanding. Maybe the question is phrased wrong. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the question is about the ratio of cost. For example, when you buy x trousers and y shirts, the ratio of the total cost of trousers to shirts is (70x)/(30y). But the man spends all 810, so 70x +30y=810.\n\nBut the problem states that he's buying as many trousers as possible, so x is maximum. So with x=11, y=1, then total cost for trousers is 770, shirts 30. So ratio is 770:30=77:3. Which is 77:3. But none of the options are in ratio form. So perhaps the question is not about that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the ratio of the number of items. So 11 trousers and 1 shirt, so 11:1. But the options are numbers, not ratios, so this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, the options are A)9, B)8, etc., which are numbers of trousers. So perhaps the question is just asking for the number of trousers when maximum is bought, which is 11, option E.\n\nSo I think the correct answer is E)11.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of trousers a man can buy with Rs 810, given that each trouser costs Rs 70 and each shirt costs Rs 30. The remaining money after buying the maximum number of trousers will be spent on shirts. The ratio of the number of trousers to shirts will then be calculated.\n\n1. **Maximum Number of Trousers**:  \n   Each trouser costs Rs 70. To find the maximum number of trousers, divide the total amount (Rs 810) by the cost per trouser:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of trousers} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{810}{70} \\right\\rfloor = 11\n   \\]  \n   Thus, the man can buy 11 trousers, which costs:  \n   \\[\n   11 \\times 70 = 770 \\, \\text{Rs}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Remaining Money for Shirts**:  \n   After buying 11 trousers, the remaining money is:  \n   \\[\n   810 - 770 = 40 \\, \\text{Rs}\n   \\]  \n   Each shirt costs Rs 30, so the number of shirts that can be bought is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of shirts} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{30} \\right\\rfloor = 1\n   \\]\n\n3. **Ratio of Trousers to Shirts**:  \n   The ratio of the number of trousers to shirts is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Number of trousers}}{\\text{Number of shirts}} = \\frac{11}{1} = 11:1\n   \\]\n\n4. **Interpreting the Options**:  \n   The question asks for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. However, the options only provide the number of trousers. Since the maximum number of trousers is 11, the correct answer is **E) 11**.\n\nAnswer: E",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see. The question is about a man who spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. The trousers cost 70 rupees each, and the shirts are 30 rupees each. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are from A to E, each giving a number of trousers, like 9, 8, etc.\n\nHmm, right. So the man wants to buy as many trousers as possible. So I need to maximize the number of trousers he buys without exceeding his total budget of 810 rupees.\n\nLet me think about this. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. Each trouser is 70, so the total cost for trousers would be 70*T. Each shirt is 30, so shirts cost 30*S. The sum of these should be equal to 810.\n\nSo the equation is:\n70T + 30S = 810\n\nBut since we want to maximize T, we should find the maximum possible integer value of T such that when multiplied by 70 and subtracted from 810, the remainder is divisible by 30 (since the shirts cost 30 each, and S has to be an integer).\n\nAlternatively, we can rearrange the equation to express S in terms of T:\n30S = 810 - 70T\nS = (810 -70T)/30\n\nS has to be a non-negative integer. So (810 -70T) must be divisible by 30 and also the result should be zero or positive.\n\nWait, let's simplify that equation. Let me compute the right side.\n\n(810 -70T)/30 can be simplified as 810/30 - (70T)/30. 810/30 is 27. 70/30 is 7/3. So,\n\nS = 27 - (7/3)T\n\nSince S must be an integer, (7/3)T must result in an integer because 27 is an integer, so subtracting that gives another integer.\n\nSo (7/3)T must be an integer. Let's think about that. That implies that T must be a multiple of 3 because 7 is a prime number and doesn't share factors with 3. So for (7/3)T to be integer, T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nWait, no, because 70 is 7*10, and 30 is 3*10. So perhaps another approach. Let me think again.\n\nWe can write the equation as:\n\n70T + 30S = 810\n\nWe can divide the entire equation by 10 to make it simpler:\n\n7T + 3S = 81\n\nSo now the equation is 7T +3S =81.\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible integer T such that S is also a non-negative integer.\n\nSo, let's solve for S:\n\n3S = 81 -7T\nS = (81 -7T)/3\n\nS must be an integer and \u22650.\n\nSo (81 -7T) must be divisible by 3 and \u22650.\n\nLet me find the maximum T such that 7T \u226481. Because if 7T >81, then S would be negative, which isn't possible.\n\nMaximum T possible without 7T exceeding 81 is floor(81/7). Let's calculate that.\n\n81 divided by 7 is approximately 11.57. So the maximum integer T could be 11. But we need to check if when T=11, S is a non-negative integer.\n\nLet me plug T=11 into S's equation.\n\nS=(81 -7*11)/3 = (81-77)/3 = 4/3 \u2248 1.333. Hmm, that's not an integer. So T=11 is not possible because S would be fractional, which doesn't make sense because you can't buy a third of a shirt.\n\nSo we need to find the next lower T that's a multiple of 3? Wait, why? Because 7T has to make 81-7T divisible by 3.\n\nWait, 7T must leave a remainder such that (81 -7T) is divisible by 3.\n\nWait, 7 mod 3 is 1. Because 7=3*2 +1. So 7T mod 3 is equal to (1*T) mod 3. So 7T mod3 = T mod3.\n\nSo, 81 mod3 is 0, because 81 is 3^4. So 81 mod3 is 0.\n\nSo for (81 -7T) to be divisible by 3, (81 mod3 -7T mod3) should be 0 mod3.\n\nWhich simplifies to (0 - (T mod3)) \u22610 mod3.\n\nSo, T mod3 must be 0.\n\nSo T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nWait, so T must be a multiple of 3 for S to be integer.\n\nSo the possible Ts are 3,6,9,12, etc., but since 7*12 is 84, which is more than 81, T can't be 12.\n\nSo the maximum T possible is 9, because 7*9=63, and 81-63=18, which is 18/3=6, which is an integer.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nT=9: 7*9=63. 81-63=18. 18/3=6. So S=6. That works.\n\nWhat about T=12? 7*12=84, which is more than 81, so S would be negative. Not allowed.\n\nT=11: 7*11=77. 81-77=4. 4/3 is not integer.\n\nT=10: 7*10=70. 81-70=11. 11/3 \u22483.666, not integer.\n\nT=9: works.\n\nWait, what about T=8? Let's see: 7*8=56. 81-56=25. 25/3 \u22488.333, not integer.\n\nT=7: 7*7=49. 81-49=32. 32/3\u224810.666, nope.\n\nT=6: 7*6=42. 81-42=39. 39/3=13. So S=13. That works.\n\nSo the possible Ts are 6,9, etc. So maximum T is 9.\n\nSo when T=9, S=6. So the ratio is T:S =9:6. That simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but the question is about the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the maximum T is 9. So the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2. But the options given are about the number of trousers, not the ratio.\n\nWait, no. The options are all giving a number of trousers, and the question is to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2. But the options don't list ratios; the options are the number of trousers, so I think the question is asking for the number of trousers when maximum is purchased, which is 9, so option A is 9 Trousers.\n\nWait, but the options are A to E, each giving a number of trousers. So the correct answer is A)9 Trousers.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because in the equation, when T is 9, S is 6. So 9 trousers and 6 shirts. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nBut the question isn't directly asking the ratio, but the ratio when maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the number of trousers is 9, which is option A.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: A man spends 810 rupees buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. What will be the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased?\n\nHmm, wait, the options are A to E, each giving a number of trousers. Oh, wait, no, the options are A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. So each option is the number of trousers. But the question is about the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers. So the man wants as many trousers as possible, which would mean buying the maximum possible number of trousers without exceeding the total amount he can spend.\n\nSo the total amount is 810 rupees. Each trouser costs 70, each shirt 30. He can buy any combination, but we want to maximize the number of trousers.\n\nLet me think: To maximize the number of trousers, he should spend as much as possible on trousers and the remaining on shirts. So, how many trousers can he buy with 810?\n\nLet me calculate the maximum possible number of trousers. Let's say he buys x trousers. The cost for x trousers is 70x. Then the remaining money will be 810 - 70x, which he can spend on shirts. Each shirt is 30, so the number of shirts is (810 -70x)/30.\n\nBut we have to ensure that (810 -70x) is a non-negative number and that it's divisible by 30 because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt.\n\nSo, 810 -70x must be \u22650 \u2192 70x \u2264810 \u2192 x \u2264810/70. Let me calculate that.\n\n810 divided by 70. 70 times 11 is 770, 70*12=840 which is more than 810. So 11 is too much. So x can be up to 11, but 70*11 is 770, which leaves 810-770=40. 40 divided by 30 is 1.333... which isn't a whole number. So he can't buy 11 trousers because he can't buy a third of a shirt.\n\nSo the next lower number is 10. Let's check x=10. 70*10=700. Remaining is 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666..., which again isn't a whole number. So that's not possible either.\n\nNext, x=9. 70*9=630. Remaining is 810-630=180. 180 divided by 30 is 6. That's a whole number. So 9 trousers and 6 shirts. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but the question is about the ratio when maximum number of trousers is bought. So 9 is the maximum number he can buy without getting a fractional shirt. But wait, I thought x could be 10, but that left 110 which isn't a multiple of 30. So 9 is the maximum.\n\nWait, but let me check x=8. 70*8=560. Remaining is 810-560=250. 250/30 is approximately 8.333. Not a whole number either. So 8 isn't working.\n\nWait, what about x=7? 70*7=490. Remaining 320. 320/30 is about 10.666. Still no. So 7 isn't working either.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think: the total amount is 810. Let's model it as 70x + 30y =810, where x is the number of trousers and y the number of shirts. We need to find integer solutions for x and y, with x as large as possible.\n\nSo we can write this as 70x + 30y =810. Let's simplify the equation. Both 70 and 30 are divisible by 10, so divide both sides by 10: 7x + 3y =81.\n\nNow, we can rearrange for y: 3y =81 -7x \u2192 y = (81-7x)/3. For y to be an integer, (81-7x) must be divisible by 3.\n\nLet me check what that means. 81 is 3*27, so 81 mod 3 is 0. So 7x must also be such that 81-7x is divisible by 3. 7 mod 3 is 1. So 7x mod3 is equal to x mod3. So 81 mod3 is 0, so 7x must also mod3 to 0. So x must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo x can be 0,3,6,9,12 etc., but since x can't exceed 11 (as 70*12=840>810), x can be up to 11. But since x must be a multiple of 3, possible x values are 0,3,6,9.\n\nWait, but 70x must be less than or equal to 810. Let's check for x=9: 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. So y=6. So that works.\n\nWhat about x=12? 70*12=840, which is over 810, so not possible.\n\nSo the maximum x is 9, which gives y=6. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but the options are about the number of trousers, not the ratio. The question says, \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\"\n\nWait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again. \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So when he buys the maximum number of trousers, what's the ratio of trousers to shirts.\n\nSo in this case, when x=9, y=6. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the options are about the number of trousers, not the ratio. The options are A)9, B)8, etc. Wait, no, the options are A)9 Trousers, etc. Oh wait, no, the options are giving the number of trousers, but the question is asking for the ratio. Hmm, wait no, the question's options are A to E, each saying a number of trousers. But the question is about the ratio when the maximum number is bought. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not asking for the ratio but the number of trousers when the ratio is something. Wait, no, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question is: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\"\n\nAh, so the ratio is (number of trousers) : (number of shirts). So when he buys the maximum number of trousers, what's the ratio between the number of trousers and shirts.\n\nIn the scenario where x=9, y=6, the ratio is 9:6 = 3:2. But the options are all giving numbers of trousers, not the ratio. So perhaps the options are giving the number of trousers, and the question is asking for that number when the maximum number is bought.\n\nWait, no, because the options are A)9 Trousers, etc. So perhaps the question is asking, what's the maximum number of trousers he can buy, given the total amount. So in that case, the answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, earlier when I thought about x=9, that's correct because x=10 and x=11 don't give integer shirts. So the maximum x is 9.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there a way to buy more than 9 trousers and have the shirts cost a whole number?\n\nWait, let's think about x=10: 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110/30=3.666... which is 11/3 shirts, which is not possible. So no.\n\nx=11: 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40/30=1.333, not integer.\n\nSo 9 is indeed the maximum number of trousers. So the answer is A)9 Trousers.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about a man who spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. The trousers cost 70 each, and the shirts are 30 each. The question is asking about the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options given are from A to E, each with a number of trousers.\n\nWait, so I need to find the maximum number of trousers he can buy without exceeding his total budget, right? Once I find that number, I can then determine how many shirts he bought alongside them and then find the ratio.\n\nLet me think. The total amount spent is 810. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S. The cost equation would be 70*T + 30*S = 810. I need to maximize T, which means I should try to buy as many trousers as possible, and whatever money is left will go into shirts.\n\nSo the approach would be to find the largest integer T such that 70*T is less than or equal to 810. Then, with the remaining money, calculate how many shirts S can be bought.\n\nLet me compute the maximum T. 70*T \u2264 810. Dividing both sides by 70: T \u2264 810/70. Let me calculate that. 810 divided by 70. 70 times 11 is 770, because 70*10 is 700, plus 70 is 770. 70*12 is 840, which is over 810. So 11 would be 770. But 810-770 is 40. So 40 rupees left. Can he buy shirts with that?\n\nEach shirt is 30, so 40 divided by 30 is 1.333. But since he can't buy a fraction of a shirt, he can buy 1 shirt. So T=11, S=1. But wait, wait a second. Let me check: 11*70=770. 1*30=30. Total is 770+30=800. That's 800, which is less than 810. There's 10 rupees left. Hmm, but 10 isn't enough to buy another shirt since each is 30. So that's the maximum number of trousers he can buy, which is 11, with 1 shirt.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 11 as the number of trousers as an option. Let me look again. The options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11. Oh, wait, option E is 11. So that would be the maximum.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck. 11*70 is 770. 810-770=40. 40 divided by 30 is 1.333, so he can buy 1 shirt, which uses 30, leaving 10. So total is 770+30=800, and he's left with 10. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but what if there's another combination where T is less than 11, but the total is exactly 810? Because maybe that way, you can get a higher number of items or a different ratio.\n\nLet me think: Suppose he buys 11 trousers, that's 770. Then, 810-770=40. He can buy one shirt (30) and have 10 left. So 11T and 1S.\n\nAlternatively, if he buys 10 trousers: 10*70=700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666, so he can buy 3 shirts (3*30=90), leaving 20. So 10T and 3S. Total spent is 700+90=790, with 20 left. That's more money left, but fewer trousers than the 11 case.\n\nSo 11T is better for maximizing the number of trousers.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about a man who spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. The trousers cost 70 each, and the shirts are 30 each. The question is asking about the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options given are from A to E, each with a number of trousers.\n\nWait, so I need to find the maximum number of trousers he can buy without exceeding his total budget, right? Once I find that number, I can then determine how many shirts he bought alongside them and then find the ratio.\n\nLet me think. The total amount spent is 810. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S. The cost equation would be 70*T + 30*S = 810. I need to maximize T, which means I should try to buy as many trousers as possible, and whatever money is left will go into shirts.\n\nSo the approach would be to find the largest integer T such that 70*T is less than or equal to 810. Then, with the remaining money, calculate how many shirts S can be bought.\n\nLet me compute the maximum T. 70*T \u2264 810. Dividing both sides by 70: T \u2264 810/70. Let me calculate that. 810 divided by 70. 70 times 11 is 770, because 70*10 is 700, plus 70 is 770. 70*12 is 840, which is over 810. So 11 would be 770. But 810-770 is 40. So 40 rupees left. Can he buy shirts with that?\n\nEach shirt is 30, so 40 divided by 30 is 1.333. But since he can't buy a fraction of a shirt, he can buy 1 shirt. So T=11, S=1. But wait, wait a second. Let me check: 11*70=770. 1*30=30. Total is 770+30=800. That's 800, which is less than 810. There's 10 rupees left. Hmm, but 10 isn't enough to buy another shirt since each is 30. So that's the maximum number of trousers he can buy, which is 11, with 1 shirt.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 11 as the number of trousers as an option. Let me look again. The options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11. Oh, wait, option E is 11. So that would be the maximum.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck. 11*70 is 770. 810-770=40. 40 divided by 30 is 1.333, so he can buy 1 shirt, which uses 30, leaving 10. So total is 770+30=800, and he's left with 10. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but what if there's another combination where T is less than 11, but the total is exactly 810? Because maybe that way, you can get a higher number of items or a different ratio.\n\nLet me think: Suppose he buys 11 trousers, that's 770. Then, 810-770=40. He can buy one shirt (30) and have 10 left. So 11T and 1S.\n\nAlternatively, if he buys 10 trousers: 10*70=700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666, so he can buy 3 shirts (3*30=90), leaving 20. So 10T and 3S. Total spent is 700+90=790, with 20 left. That's more money left, but fewer trousers than the 11 case.\n\nSo 11T is better for maximizing the number of trousers. So the maximum number is 11, which is option E.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So when T is maximum, what is the ratio of T:S.\n\nIn the case where T is 11, S is 1.

Each trouser costs 70 rupees, and each shirt is 30 rupees. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11. Hmm, but wait, the options are just the number of trousers. So I think the question is asking how many trousers he buys when he spends 810, buying as many as possible, and then the ratio would be that number to the number of shirts.\n\nWait, no, the options are the number of trousers, so the ratio of trouser to shirt would be something like (number of trousers) : (number of shirts). But the options give only the number of trousers. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.\n\nSo, the problem is about maximizing the number of trousers bought. He's spending a total of 810 rupees. Let me denote the number of trousers as t and shirts as s.\n\nEach trouser is 70, each shirt is 30. So the total cost equation is 70t + 30s = 810.\n\nWe want to maximize t, which means we should buy as many trousers as possible without exceeding the total amount. But we also need to buy some shirts, right? Because otherwise, he could just buy all trousers. Wait, no, maybe not. The problem doesn't specify that he has to buy both. Wait, does he have to buy at least one of each? Hmm, the question says \"buying trouser at Rs70 each and shirt at 30 each.\" So perhaps he could buy all trousers if possible, but let's see.\n\nSo, to maximize t, we should minimize the number of shirts, ideally zero. But is that possible? Let's check.\n\nIf he buys 0 shirts, then the total cost is 70t = 810. So t = 810 /70. Let me calculate that. 70 times 11 is 770, 70*12=840. So 810 is between 770 and 840. 810 -770=40, so 40/70 is 4/7. So t would be 11 and 4/7, which isn't possible because you can't buy a fraction of a trouser. So he can buy 11 trousers, which would cost 770 rupees, leaving 40. But 40 isn't enough to buy a shirt because each shirt is 30. Wait, 40 is more than 30, so can he buy one shirt? Let's see: 70*11=770, 30*1=30. Total is 800, which is less than 810. So he has 10 rupees left, which isn't enough for anything else. So in this case, he could buy 11 trousers and 1 shirt, but that's not maximizing the number of trousers because maybe buying more shirts would allow more trousers?\n\nWait, no. Wait, if he buys 11 trousers, he spends 770, then he has 40 left. He can't buy any more trousers, but he can buy one shirt, using 30, leaving 10. But perhaps if he buys more shirts, he can adjust to buy more trousers. Hmm, perhaps I should approach this with an equation.\n\nSo, 70t + 30s = 810.\n\nWe can rewrite this as 7t + 3s = 81 (by dividing both sides by 10). So 7t +3s=81.\n\nWe want to find integer values of t and s such that this equation holds, and t is as large as possible.\n\nSo let's solve for s in terms of t.\n\n3s = 81 -7t\n\ns = (81 -7t)/3\n\ns must be a non-negative integer, so (81 -7t) must be divisible by 3 and non-negative.\n\nSo 81 is divisible by 3, because 8+1=9, which is divisible by 3. 7t mod 3: 7 mod3 is 1, so 7t mod3 is t mod3.\n\nSo 81 -7t \u2261 0 mod3 \u2192 0 - t \u22610 \u2192 t \u22610 mod3.\n\nSo t must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo t can be 0, 3,6,9,12, etc., but since t must satisfy 7t \u226481 \u2192 t \u226411.57. So maximum t can be 11, but t must be a multiple of 3. So possible t values are 0,3,6,9,12 (but 12 is 84, which is more than 81, so not allowed). So the maximum possible t is 9.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried t=11, it didn't fit. Let me check for t=9.\n\nIf t=9, then 7*9=63. 81-63=18. So 3s=18 \u2192 s=6. So 9 trousers and 6 shirts. Total cost: 9*70=630, 6*30=180. 630+180=810. Perfect.\n\nBut wait, earlier when I tried t=11, I had 70*11=770, which leaves 40. 40 is more than 30, but 40/30 is 1 and 10/30. So s=1 gives 30, but that leaves 10, which can't buy anything else. But according to the equation approach, t=11 would require s=(81-77)/3= (4)/3=1.333, which is not an integer. So that's not allowed. So t can't be 11 because s would not be an integer. So the maximum possible t is 9, with s=6.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check for t=11 again. Maybe I can buy 11 trousers and some shirts, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me calculate s for t=11.\n\ns=(81-7*11)/3 \u2192 (81-77)=4 \u2192 4/3\u22481.333. Not integer. So s must be 1.333, which isn't possible. So t=11 is not allowed. So the maximum possible t is 9.\n\nSo the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the options only give the number of trousers. The options are A)9, B)8, etc. So the answer would be 9 trousers, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any higher t. Let's check t=10. 7*10=70. 81-70=11. 11/3=3.666\u2026 which isn't an integer. So s would be 3.666, which is invalid.\n\nt=11: as above, s=1.333. Not valid.\n\nt=12: 7*12=84, which is more than 81, so not allowed.\n\nSo the next possible t after 9 is 12, which is too high. So 9 is the maximum possible t.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6, which reduces to 3:2, but the question is only about the number of trousers when maximum are bought. So the answer is 9, which is option A.\n",

So that's not allowed. So t can't be 11 because s would not be an integer. So the maximum possible t is 9, with s=6.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check for t=11 again. Maybe I can buy 11 trousers and some shirts, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me calculate s for t=11.\n\ns=(81-7*11)/3 \u2192 (81-77)=4 \u2192 4/3\u22481.333. Not integer. So s must be 1.333, which isn't possible. So t=11 is not allowed. So the maximum possible t is 9.\n\nSo the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the options only give the number of trousers. The options are A)9, B)8, etc. So the answer would be 9 trousers, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any higher t. Let's check t=10. 7*10=70. 81-70=11. 11/3=3.666\u2026 which isn't an integer. So s would be 3.666, which is invalid.\n\nt=11: as above, s=1.333. Not valid.\n\nt=12: 7*12=84, which is more than 81, so not allowed.\n\nSo the next possible t after 9 is 12, which is too high. So 9 is the maximum possible t.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6, which reduces to 3:2, but the question is only about the number of trousers when maximum are bought. So the answer is 9, which is option A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased with 810 rupees, given that each trouser costs 70 rupees and each shirt costs 30 rupees. The total expenditure equation is:\n\n\\[\n70t + 30s = 810\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( t \\) is the number of trousers and \\( s \\) is the number of shirts. To maximize \\( t \\), we aim to minimize \\( s \\) while ensuring both \\( t \\) and \\( s \\) are non-negative integers.\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the equation\nDivide the entire equation by 10 to simplify:\n\\[\n7t + 3s = 81\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Solve for \\( s \\) in terms of \\( t \\)\nRearranging for \\( s \\):\n\\[\ns = \\frac{81 - 7t}{3}\n\\]\n\nFor \\( s \\) to be an integer, \\( 81 - 7t \\) must be divisible by 3. Since 81 is divisible by 3, \\( 7t \\) must also be divisible by 3. Because \\( 7 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3 \\), \\( t \\) must be a multiple of 3.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the maximum \\( t \\)\nThe maximum \\( t \\) is constrained by \\( 7t \\leq 81 \\), so:\n\\[\nt \\leq \\frac{81}{7} \\approx 11.57\n\\]\nThus, the possible values of \\( t \\) are 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12. Testing these values:\n\n- For \\( t = 12 \\): \\( 7 \\times 12 = 84 \\), which exceeds 81, so \\( t = 12 \\) is invalid.\n- For \\( t = 9 \\): \\( 7 \\times 9 = 63 \\), and \\( s = \\frac{81 - 63}{3} = 6 \\). This gives \\( t = 9 \\) and \\( s = 6 \\), which satisfies the equation.\n- For \\( t = 10 \\): \\( 7 \\times 10 = 70 \\), and \\( s = \\frac{81 - 70}{3} = \\frac{11}{3} \\), which is not an integer.\n- For \\( t = 11 \\): \\( 7 \\times 11 = 77 \\), and \\( s = \\frac{81 - 77}{3} = \\frac{4}{3} \\), which is not an integer.\n\nThus, the maximum valid \\( t \\) is 9, with \\( s = 6 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Verify the solution\nFor \\( t = 9 \\) and \\( s = 6 \\):\n\\[\n70 \\times 9 + 30 \\times 6 = 630 + 180 = 810\n\\]\nThis satisfies the total expenditure of 810 rupees.\n\n### Step 5: Answer the question\nThe ratio of trousers to shirts is \\( 9:6 \\), but the question only asks for the number of trousers when the maximum number is purchased. Therefore, the answer is 9.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where a man spends 810 rupees buying trousers and shirts. The trousers cost 70 each and shirts are 30 each. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers possible. The options are given as A to E with different numbers of trousers.\n\nHmm, let me think. So the goal is to maximize the number of trousers he can buy without exceeding his total budget of 810 rupees. So I guess I need to set up an equation where the total cost equals 810.\n\nLet me denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. Each trouser is 70, so the cost for trousers is 70*T. Each shirt is 30, so shirts cost 30*S. The sum of these should be 810.\n\nSo the equation is:\n70T + 30S = 810.\n\nBut wait, since he wants to maximize T, I think I should express S in terms of T or vice versa. Let me try to solve for S.\n\n30S = 810 - 70T\nS = (810 - 70T) / 30\n\nSimplify that, I can factor out 10 from numerator and denominator.\nS = (81 - 7T) / 3\n\nWait, because 810 divided by 10 is 81, and 70T divided by 10 is 7T, and 30 divided by 10 is 3. So yeah, S is (81 -7T)/3.\n\nNow, since the number of shirts S has to be a whole number, right? You can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So (81 -7T) must be divisible by 3. Let me think about that.\n\nWait, 81 is divisible by 3 because 81 / 3 is 27. So 81 mod 3 is 0. Then, 7T mod 3 should also result in the numerator being divisible by 3. Let's see, 7 mod 3 is 1. So 7T mod 3 is same as (1*T) mod3, which is T mod3.\n\nSo for the numerator (81-7T) to be divisible by 3, 7T must leave a remainder that 81 - 7T is divisible by 3. Since 81 is 0 mod3, 7T must also be 0 mod3. So 7T mod3 = (T mod3) must be 0. Therefore, T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nWait, but that's only part of the condition. Also, S must be non-negative because you can't buy a negative number of shirts. So (81 -7T) must be >=0.\n\nSo 81 -7T >=0 \u2192 7T <=81 \u2192 T <=81/7. Let me calculate that: 7*11 is 77, 7*12 is 84 which is over 81. So 81/7 is about 11.57. So the maximum integer T can be is 11.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that T must be a multiple of 3 because (81-7T) must be divisible by 3. So T could be 0,3,6,9,12... but wait, 12 is more than 11.57, so the maximum possible T is 11? But wait, wait, 11 is not a multiple of 3. Hmm, so that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier reasoning. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the equation S = (81 -7T)/3 must result in an integer because S is the number of shirts. So 81-7T must be a multiple of 3. So 81 is 0 mod3, so 7T must be 0 mod3 as well. Because 0 - 7T must be 0 mod3, so 7T must be 0 mod3.\n\nBut 7 mod3 is 1, so 7T mod3 = (1 * T) mod3 = T mod3. So for 7T to be 0 mod3, T must be 0 mod3. So T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo the maximum T is the largest multiple of 3 that is less than or equal to 11.57. The multiples of 3 up to 11 are 3,6,9. So the next would be 9, but wait 9 is less than 11.57. Then 12 is over, so the maximum T is 9? Because 9 is the largest multiple of 3 not exceeding 11.57.\n\nWait, but wait, 9 is 9, and 11 is higher than that. So if T is 9, let's see what S would be.\n\nPlugging T=9 into S = (81 -7*9)/3 \u2192 81-63 =18 \u2192 18/3=6 shirts. So S=6. That's acceptable.\n\nBut wait, what if T is 11? Let me check if that's possible. Because 11 is higher than 9, but earlier condition says T must be a multiple of 3. 11 is not a multiple of 3. So (81-7*11) = 81-77=4. 4 divided by 3 is 1.333... which is not an integer. So S can't be a fraction, so T=11 is invalid.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check for T=10. Because 10 is not a multiple of 3. Let's see T=10.\n\nThen S = (81-70)/3 \u2192 81-70 is 11. 11/3 is approximately 3.666..., which is not an integer. So no, T=10 can't be.\n\nWhat about T=12? That's more than 11.57, so it's over the budget. So not allowed.\n\nWait, so the maximum T is 9, giving 6 shirts. So the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but the options are giving the number of trousers as the answer, not the ratio. The question says, \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" Wait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me check again.\n\nAh, the question is: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\"\n\nWait, the ratio is T:S. So when T is maximum, which is 9, S is 6, so the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the options are giving options for the number of trousers, not the ratio. Wait, looking back at the question:\n\nThe options are A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. So the question is asking for the number of trousers when he buys the maximum possible, and the ratio is that number compared to the shirts. But wait, the question says \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So the ratio is T:S, but the options are giving the number of T. So perhaps the question is actually asking for the number of trousers, not the ratio. Hmm, maybe I misread the question.\n\nWait, the question is: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\"\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is 9:6, but the options are giving the number of trousers, so perhaps the correct answer is 9, option A.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should reevaluate. Let's see, maybe I can find a higher T that is not a multiple of 3 but still gives an integer S. Because maybe I was wrong in my earlier approach.\n\nWait, let's try to think differently. Let's say the total cost is 810. Let me write the equation again: 70T + 30S =810. I can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 10: 7T + 3S = 81.\n\nSo 7T +3S =81.\n\nWe need to find integer solutions for T and S where both are non-negative.\n\nWe can think of this as solving for T and S in integers.\n\nWe can express S as (81 -7T)/3.\n\nWe need (81-7T) to be divisible by 3 and non-negative.\n\nSo 81-7T >=0 \u2192 T <=81/7 \u2192 approx 11.57, so T can be up to 11.\n\nWe need (81-7T) mod3=0.\n\n81 mod3 is 0. So 7T mod3 must be 0. 7 mod3 is 1, so 7T mod3 is T mod3. So T mod3 must be 0. So T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo possible T values are 0,3,6,9,12... but since T can't exceed 11, the possible Ts are 0,3,6,9.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9. Then S = (81-63)/3 = 18/3 =6.\n\nSo the ratio of T:S is 9:6 \u2192 3:2.\n\nBut the question is asking for the ratio, but the options are giving the number of Trousers. So the answer is 9 Trousers, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's see if T=9 is the maximum possible. What about T=10?\n\nFor T=10: 70*10=700. Remaining is 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666, which isn't an integer. So no.\n\nT=11: 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40/30 is 1.333... Not an integer. So no.\n\nT=12: 70*12=840>810. So no.\n\nSo yes, the maximum T is 9. So the answer is 9 Trousers, option A.\n",

So I guess I need to set up an equation where the total cost equals 810.\n\nLet me denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. Each trouser is 70, so the cost for trousers is 70*T. Each shirt is 30, so shirts cost 30*S. The sum of these should be 810.\n\nSo the equation is:\n70T + 30S = 810.\n\nBut wait, since he wants to maximize T, I think I should express S in terms of T or vice versa. Let me try to solve for S.\n\n30S = 810 - 70T\nS = (810 - 70T) / 30\n\nSimplify that, I can factor out 10 from numerator and denominator.\nS = (81 - 7T) / 3\n\nWait, because 810 divided by 10 is 81, and 70T divided by 10 is 7T, and 30 divided by 10 is 3. So yeah, S is (81 -7T)/3.\n\nNow, since the number of shirts S has to be a whole number, right? You can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So (81 -7T) must be divisible by 3. Let me think about that.\n\nWait, 81 is divisible by 3 because 81 / 3 is 27. So 81 mod 3 is 0. Then, 7T mod 3 should also result in the numerator being divisible by 3. Let's see, 7 mod 3 is 1. So 7T mod 3 is same as (1*T) mod3, which is T mod3.\n\nSo for the numerator (81-7T) to be divisible by 3, 7T must leave a remainder that 81 - 7T is divisible by 3. Since 81 is 0 mod3, 7T must also be 0 mod3. So 7T mod3 = (T mod3) must be 0. Therefore, T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nWait, but that's only part of the condition. Also, S must be non-negative because you can't buy a negative number of shirts. So (81 -7T) must be >=0.\n\nSo 81 -7T >=0 \u2192 7T <=81 \u2192 T <=81/7. Let me calculate that: 7*11 is 77, 7*12 is 84 which is over 81. So 81/7 is about 11.57. So the maximum integer T can be is 11.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that T must be a multiple of 3 because (81-7T) must be divisible by 3. So T could be 0,3,6,9,12... but wait, 12 is more than 11.57, so the maximum possible T is 11? But wait, wait, 11 is not a multiple of 3. Hmm, so that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier reasoning. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the equation S = (81 -7T)/3 must result in an integer because S is the number of shirts. So 81-7T must be a multiple of 3. So 81 is 0 mod3, so 7T must be 0 mod3 as well. Because 0 - 7T must be 0 mod3, so 7T must be 0 mod3.\n\nBut 7 mod3 is 1, so 7T mod3 = (1 * T) mod3 = T mod3. So for 7T to be 0 mod3, T must be 0 mod3. So T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo the maximum T is the largest multiple of 3 that is less than or equal to 11.57. The multiples of 3 up to 11 are 3,6,9. So the next would be 9, but wait 9 is less than 11.57. Then 12 is over, so the maximum T is 9? Because 9 is the largest multiple of 3 not exceeding 11.57.\n\nWait, but wait, 9 is 9, and 11 is higher than that. So if T is 9, let's see what S would be.\n\nPlugging T=9 into S = (81 -7*9)/3 \u2192 81-63 =18 \u2192 18/3=6 shirts. So S=6. That's acceptable.\n\nBut wait, what if T is 11? Let me check if that's possible. Because 11 is higher than 9, but earlier condition says T must be a multiple of 3. 11 is not a multiple of 3. So (81-7*11) = 81-77=4. 4 divided by 3 is 1.333... which is not an integer. So S can't be a fraction, so T=11 is invalid.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check for T=10. Because 10 is not a multiple of 3. Let's see T=10.\n\nThen S = (81-70)/3 \u2192 81-70 is 11. 11/3 is approximately 3.666..., which is not an integer. So no, T=10 can't be.\n\nWhat about T=12? That's more than 11.57, so it's over the budget. So not allowed.\n\nWait, so the maximum T is 9, giving 6 shirts. So the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but the options are giving the number of trousers as the answer, not the ratio. The question says, \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" Wait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me check again.\n\nAh, the question is: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\"\n\nWait, the ratio is T:S. So when T is maximum, which is 9, S is 6, so the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the options are giving options for the number of trousers, not the ratio. Wait, looking back at the question:\n\nThe options are A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. So the question is asking for the number of trousers when he buys the maximum possible, and the ratio is that number compared to the shirts. But wait, the question says \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So the ratio is T:S, but the options are giving the number of T. So perhaps the question is actually asking for the number of trousers, not the ratio. Hmm, maybe I misread the question.\n\nWait, the question is: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\"\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is 9:6, but the options are giving the number of trousers, so perhaps the correct answer is 9, option A.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should reevaluate. Let's see, maybe I can find a higher T that is not a multiple of 3 but still gives an integer S. Because maybe I was wrong in my earlier approach.\n\nWait, let's try to think differently. Let's say the total cost is 810. Let me write the equation again: 70T + 30S =810. I can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 10: 7T + 3S = 81.\n\nSo 7T +3S =81.\n\nWe need to find integer solutions for T and S where both are non-negative.\n\nWe can think of this as solving for T and S in integers.\n\nWe can express S as (81 -7T)/3.\n\nWe need (81-7T) to be divisible by 3 and non-negative.\n\nSo 81-7T >=0 \u2192 T <=81/7 \u2192 approx 11.57, so T can be up to 11.\n\nWe need (81-7T) mod3=0.\n\n81 mod3 is 0. So 7T mod3 must be 0. 7 mod3 is 1, so 7T mod3 is T mod3. So T mod3 must be 0. So T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo possible T values are 0,3,6,9,12... but since T can't exceed 11, the possible Ts are 0,3,6,9.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9. Then S = (81-63)/3 = 18/3 =6.\n\nSo the ratio of T:S is 9:6 \u2192 3:2.\n\nBut the question is asking for the ratio, but the options are giving the number of Trousers. So the answer is 9 Trousers, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's see if T=9 is the maximum possible. What about T=10?\n\nFor T=10: 70*10=700. Remaining is 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666, which isn't an integer. So no.\n\nT=11: 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40/30 is 1.333... Not an integer. So no.\n\nT=12: 70*12=840>810. So no.\n\nSo yes, the maximum T is 9. So the answer is 9 Trousers, option A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of trousers (T) that can be purchased with a total budget of 810 rupees, given that each trouser costs 70 rupees and each shirt costs 30 rupees. The ratio of trousers to shirts is then calculated based on this maximum number of trousers.\n\n### Step 1: Set up the equation\nThe total cost equation is:\n\\[\n70T + 30S = 810\n\\]\nwhere \\(T\\) is the number of trousers and \\(S\\) is the number of shirts.\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the equation\nDivide the entire equation by 10 to simplify:\n\\[\n7T + 3S = 81\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Express \\(S\\) in terms of \\(T\\)\nRearranging for \\(S\\):\n\\[\nS = \\frac{81 - 7T}{3}\n\\]\nFor \\(S\\) to be an integer, \\((81 - 7T)\\) must be divisible by 3.\n\n### Step 4: Determine constraints for \\(T\\)\n- \\(T\\) must be a non-negative integer.\n- \\(81 - 7T \\geq 0 \\implies T \\leq \\frac{81}{7} \\approx 11.57\\), so \\(T \\leq 11\\).\n\n### Step 5: Analyze divisibility\nSince \\(81 \\mod 3 = 0\\), for \\((81 - 7T)\\) to be divisible by 3, \\(7T \\mod 3\\) must also be 0. Because \\(7 \\mod 3 = 1\\), this implies \\(T \\mod 3 = 0\\). Therefore, \\(T\\) must be a multiple of 3.\n\n### Step 6: Identify possible values of \\(T\\)\nThe possible values of \\(T\\) are multiples of 3 up to the maximum \\(T \\leq 11\\):  \n\\[\nT = 0, 3, 6, 9\n\\]\nThe maximum \\(T\\) is 9.\n\n### Step 7: Calculate \\(S\\) for \\(T = 9\\)\nSubstitute \\(T = 9\\) into the equation for \\(S\\):\n\\[\nS = \\frac{81 - 7(9)}{3} = \\frac{81 - 63}{3} = \\frac{18}{3} = 6\n\\]\nThus, when \\(T = 9\\), \\(S = 6\\).\n\n### Step 8: Determine the ratio of trousers to shirts\nThe ratio of trousers to shirts is:\n\\[\nT:S = 9:6 = 3:2\n\\]\n\n### Step 9: Verify other values of \\(T\\)\nFor \\(T = 10\\) and \\(T = 11\\), \\(S\\) is not an integer, so these values are invalid. Therefore, the maximum valid \\(T\\) is 9.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe maximum number of trousers purchased is 9, corresponding to option **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where a man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. Trousers are 70 each and shirts are 30 each. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. Hmm, I need to figure out how to approach this.\n\nLet me think. So, the total expenditure is 810. Let me denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. Each trouser costs 70, so the total spent on trousers is 70*T. Each shirt is 30, so that's 30*S. The sum of these two should be 810. So, the equation is 70T + 30S = 810.\n\nNow, the problem says we need the maximum number of trousers. That means I should try to maximize T, right? Because the maximum number of trousers would use up as much of the 810 as possible on the more expensive item, leaving the remainder for shirts.\n\nBut wait, how do I find the maximum T possible without exceeding the total amount? Let me rearrange the equation. 70T + 30S = 810. I can write this as 7T + 3S = 81 (since I divided everything by 10). Hmm, maybe that's easier to work with.\n\nSo, 7T + 3S = 81. I need to find integer values of T and S that satisfy this equation, with T as large as possible. Because S can't be negative, the maximum T would be when S is as small as possible, maybe zero. But wait, can S be zero? Let me check.\n\nIf S is zero, then 7T =81. But 81 divided by 7 is approximately 11.57, which isn't an integer. So T can't be 11.57. So the next step is to find the largest integer T such that 7T is less than or equal to 81, and (81-7T) is divisible by 3 because S must be an integer.\n\nWait, another approach: 7T must leave a remainder when subtracted from 81 that is a multiple of 3. Let's see. 81 divided by 7 is 11.57, so the maximum possible T is 11, but let's check if that works.\n\nT=11: 7*11=77. 81-77=4. 4 divided by 3 is 1.333, which isn't an integer. So S would be 4/3, which isn't possible because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So T=11 is not possible.\n\nNext, T=10. 7*10=70. 81-70=11. 11 divided by 3 is about 3.666. Again, not an integer. So T=10 also doesn't work.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Maybe I should try another approach. Let's think of possible T values starting from the maximum possible down to zero, and check if (81 -7T) is divisible by 3.\n\nThe maximum T possible would be when 7T \u226481. So T_max = floor(81/7) = 11 (since 11*7=77, which is less than 81, and 12*7=84, which is over 81).\n\nSo let's go from T=11 down.\n\nT=11: 7*11=77. 81-77=4. 4 divided by 3 is not an integer. So S=4/3 invalid.\n\nT=10: 7*10=70. 81-70=11. 11/3 \u22483.666, not integer.\n\nT=9: 7*9=63. 81-63=18. 18/3=6. So S=6. That works because 6 is an integer.\n\nSo T=9, S=6. That gives the maximum number of trousers possible, which is 9. \n\nWait, but wait, the question is about the ratio of trousers to shirts when maximum number of trousers is bought. So the ratio is T:S = 9:6. Simplifying, that's 3:2.\n\nBut wait, the options are about the number of trousers, not the ratio. Oh wait, no, the question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the ratio is 9:6, which reduces to 3:2. But the options are giving possible numbers of trousers, not the ratio. Wait, looking back at the question.\n\nWait, the options are A)9 Trousers, etc. Oh, no, wait. The options are for the ratio, but phrased as \"9 Trousers\", which I think is a typo. Or perhaps the options are giving the number of trousers, but the question is about the ratio. Hmm, perhaps I misread the question.\n\nWait, the question says, \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\"\n\nWait, the options are labeled as A)9 Trousers, which might be the number of trouser, but the question is about the ratio.

The options are A)9 Trousers, etc. Oh wait, perhaps the options are giving the number of trousers, but the question is about the ratio, so maybe I'm supposed to find the ratio and see which option corresponds to it.\n\nWait, but the options are all just numbers with 'Trousers' attached. So perhaps the options are giving the number of trouser, but the question is about the ratio. That doesn't seem to fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are the possible ratios, but written as the number of trousers. Hmm, that might not make sense.

So the question is a bit ambiguous. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the number of trousers when maximum is bought, and the ratio is a way to present that. Or perhaps the ratio is the key part, but the options are giving the number of trousers, which is part of the ratio.\n\nWait, I think I might have misread the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe man spends 810 on trousers and shirts. The cost per trouser is 70, shirt is 30. What is the ratio of trouser to shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\n\nSo the ratio is T:S. So the correct ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2. But the options are giving numbers of trousers, not ratios. So perhaps the options are indicating the number of trousers, and the correct answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but the question is about the ratio, so maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is T:S, and the options are giving the number of T, so the correct T is 9, so the answer is A)9 Trousers.\n\nWait, but the options are about the number of T, not the ratio. So perhaps the question is actually asking for the number of T when maximum is bought. So the correct number is 9, so the answer is A.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased as the ratio, but the options are giving the number of T. That could be a mistake in the question, but given the options, perhaps the intended answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nSo, to recap: The maximum number of T is 9, which gives S=6. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question is asking for the ratio, but the options are the number of T. So perhaps the correct option is A)9 Trousers, implying that 9 is the maximum number of T.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is to be expressed as the number of T, but that doesn't make much sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the maximum number of T, which is 9, so the answer is option A.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the correct answer is 9, which is option A.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The question says a man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. The trousers cost 70 rupees each, and the shirts are 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options given are A to E, each indicating a certain number of trousers, but I think the actual ratio is what's needed. Wait, wait, no, looking again, the options are A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. So each option is the number of trouser pieces. Hmm, maybe the question is asking for how many trousers he buys, given that he buys the maximum possible number of them, and then the ratio comes from that number and the corresponding number of shirts.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So the ratio is between the number of trousers and shirts. But the options are just numbers of trousers, so perhaps the correct option is the number of trousers, and the ratio is a part of the answer. Or maybe the options are giving the number of trousers, and the question is about that.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is more about determining the maximum number of trousers he can buy, given the total amount. Then, once you find that number, the ratio of trousers to shirts would be determined by how many shirts he had to buy with the remaining money.\n\nLet me think. The man spends a total of 810 rupees. Each trouser is 70, each shirt is 30. He wants to buy as many trousers as possible. So first, I should find the maximum number of trousers he can buy without exceeding 810.\n\nLet me calculate how many trousers he can buy with 810. Since each trouser is 70, dividing 810 by 70 will give the maximum number, but it might not be a whole number, so we have to take the integer part.\n\nSo 810 \u00f7 70 equals... let me compute. 70 times 11 is 770. 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So 11 would be too much because 11*70 is 770. Wait, wait, 70*11 is 770, which is less than 810. Oh wait, no, 70*11 is 770. Then 70*12 is 840, which is over. So the maximum number of trousers he can buy is 11, because 11*70 = 770, which is less than 810. Then, the remaining money would be 810 - 770 = 40 rupees.\n\nWait, but 40 isn't enough for a shirt, since each shirt is 30. So wait, 40 can't buy a shirt because 30 is the cost. So, 40 is more than 30, but wait, if you have 40, you can buy one shirt and have 10 left. But 10 is not enough for another shirt. So perhaps the man can buy one shirt with the remaining 40.\n\nWait, no. Let me recalculate. 70 * 11 = 770, so 810 -770 = 40. So he has 40 left. With 40, he can buy 1 shirt (30) and have 10 left, which isn't enough for another shirt. So total shirts would be 1, and total trousers 11. So the ratio of trousers to shirts is 11:1.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 11 Trousers. So the answer would be E.\n\nWait, but let me check if 11 is indeed the maximum. Let me see: 70 *11=770. 70*12=840 which is more than 810. So yes, 11 is the max number of trousers he can buy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is phrased differently. It says the ratio when maximum number of trousers is purchased. So perhaps the ratio is the number of trousers to the number of shirts. So in this case, 11 trousers and 1 shirt, so the ratio is 11:1.\n\nWait, but let me check if the remaining money allows for more shirts. Let's see, 40 rupees left. Each shirt is 30. So 40 divided by 30 is 1 with a remainder of 10. So only 1 shirt can be bought. So the ratio is 11:1, which would make the number of trousers 11, which is option E.\n\nBut wait, the options are A to E, each giving the number of trousers. So the question is, when he buys the maximum number of trousers, how many does he buy? The options are 9,8,10,7,11. So the correct number is 11, which is option E.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let's make sure that 11 is the maximum. 70*11=770, 70*12=840. 840>810, so yes, 11 is the maximum number of trousers.\n\nAnother approach: Let me model it with an equation. Let t be the number of trousers, and s the number of shirts. The total cost is 70t +30s=810. We want to maximize t, so we'll solve for s in terms of t.\n\n70t +30s =810 \u2192 30s =810 -70t \u2192 s=(810-70t)/30 \u2192 s=27 - (7t/3).\n\nSince s must be an integer >=0, 7t must be divisible by 3. So 7t mod3 must be 0. 7 mod3 is 1, so t must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo t can be 3,6,9,12... but since 70t <=810, t<=11. So the possible t values are 3,6,9. Wait, but 70*11 is 770, which is within 810. Wait, but 11 isn't a multiple of 3. So how does that fit? Because if t isn't a multiple of 3, then 7t might not be divisible by 3, leading s to be a fraction, which isn't allowed.\n\nWait, so perhaps the maximum t is 9, which is a multiple of 3. Let me check: t=9 \u2192 70*9=630. Remaining money 810-630=180. 180/30=6 shirts. So s=6. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the earlier approach. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach. Let me re-examine. If t is 11, then 70*11=770. 810-770=40. So s=40/30=1.333..., which is not an integer. So s can't be 1.333. So that means t=11 is not possible because s would have to be 1.333, which is not allowed. So the maximum possible t is the largest t for which 810-70t is divisible by 30.\n\nWait, so perhaps I should approach this as finding t such that (810-70t) is divisible by 30, and t is as large as possible.\n\nSo 810-70t must be divisible by 30.\n\nLet me represent this as 70t \u2261810 mod30.\n\nBut 70 mod30 is 10, and 810 mod30 is 0, because 810/30 is 27, so no remainder.\n\nSo 10t \u22610 mod30 \u2192 10t is divisible by 30 \u2192 t must be divisible by 3.\n\nSo t has to be a multiple of 3. So the maximum possible t is 9, because 9*70=630. 810-630=180 \u2192 180/30=6 shirts. So 9:6 is the ratio.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought t=11 was possible, but that led to s being 1.333, which isn't allowed. So perhaps the maximum t is 9. So the answer would be option A, 9 trousers.\n\nBut wait, that's conflicting with the initial approach. Let me try to see where I went wrong.\n\nIn the first approach, I considered that t=11 is allowed because 70*11=770, which is under 810, but I didn't check whether the remaining money allows s to be an integer. So when I tried t=11, I found s= (810-770)/30 =40/30=1.333, which is not an integer. So t=11 is not allowed because s can't be a fraction.\n\nSo the next possible t is 9. Let me check: t=9 \u219270*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6 \u2192 s=6. So that's allowed. So t=9, s=6. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nBut the question asks for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So if t=9 is the maximum possible, then the ratio is 9:6.\n\nBut wait, are there any t higher than 9 that are multiples of 3 and satisfy 70t \u2264810?\n\nNext multiple of 3 after 9 is 12. 70*12=840, which is more than 810. So no, t can't be 12. So 9 is the maximum.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought t=11 was allowed, I thought s would be 1.333, but that's not allowed. So the maximum t is 9, leading to 6 shirts.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but the options are giving only the number of trousers. So the correct option would be A)9 Trousers.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. So the initial approach thought that t=11 is possible, but it's not because s ends up being a fraction. So the correct maximum t is 9.\n\nSo the answer would be option A, 9 trousers.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the second approach. Let me think again. Maybe t doesn't have to be a multiple of 3. Because 70t +30s=810 \u2192 70t=810-30s \u2192 70t must be 810-30s. 810 is divisible by 30, so 30s must be subtracted, so 70t must also be 810 mod30.\n\nWait, 70 mod30 is 10, so 70t mod30 is 10t mod30. 810 mod30 is 0, so 10t mod30 must be 0. So 10t must be a multiple of 30 \u2192 t must be a multiple of 3, as 10 and 30 have a GCD of 10. So 10t=30k \u2192 t=3k.\n\nSo t must be a multiple of 3. So maximum t is 9.\n\nSo the correct answer is 9 trousers, option A.\n\nSo the initial approach was wrong because I didn't consider that s must be an integer. So the correct maximum number is 9, leading to 6 shirts. Ratio is 9:6, but the question is asking for the number of trousers, so the correct option is A)9.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The question says a man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. The trousers cost 70 rupees each, and the shirts are 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options given are A to E, each indicating a certain number of trousers, but I think the actual ratio is what's needed. Wait, wait, no, looking again, the options are A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. So each option is the number of trouser pieces. Hmm, maybe the question is asking for how many trousers he buys, given that he buys the maximum possible number of them, and then the ratio comes from that number and the corresponding number of shirts.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So the ratio is between the number of trousers and shirts. But the options are just numbers of trousers, so perhaps the correct option is the number of trousers, and the ratio is a part of the answer. Or maybe the options are giving the number of trousers, and the question is about that.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is more about determining the maximum number of trousers he can buy, given the total amount. Then, once you find that number, the ratio of trousers to shirts would be determined by how many shirts he had to buy with the remaining money.\n\nLet me think. The man spends a total of 810 rupees. Each trouser is 70, each shirt is 30. He wants to buy as many trousers as possible. So first, I should find the maximum number of trousers he can buy without exceeding 810.\n\nLet me calculate how many trousers he can buy with 810. Since each trouser is 70, dividing 810 by 70 will give the maximum number, but it might not be a whole number, so we have to take the integer part.\n\nSo 810 \u00f7 70 equals... let me compute. 70 times 11 is 770. 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So 11 would be too much because 11*70 is 770. Wait, wait, 70*11 is 770, which is less than 810. Oh wait, no, 70*11 is 770. Then 70*12 is 840, which is over. So the maximum number of trousers he can buy is 11, because 11*70 = 770, which is less than 810. Then, the remaining money would be 810 - 770 = 40 rupees.\n\nWait, but 40 isn't enough for a shirt, since each shirt is 30. So wait, 40 can't buy a shirt because 30 is the cost. So, 40 is more than 30, but wait, if you have 40, you can buy one shirt and have 10 left. But 10 is not enough for another shirt. So perhaps the man can buy one shirt with the remaining 40.\n\nWait, no. Let me recalculate. 70 * 11 = 770, so 810 -770 = 40. So he has 40 left. With 40, he can buy 1 shirt (30) and have 10 left, which isn't enough for another shirt. So total shirts would be 1, and total trousers 11. So the ratio of trousers to shirts is 11:1.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 11 Trousers. So the answer would be E.\n\nWait, but let me check if 11 is indeed the maximum. Let me see: 70 *11=770. 70*12=840 which is more than 810. So yes, 11 is the max number of trousers he can buy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is phrased differently. It says the ratio when maximum number of trousers is purchased. So perhaps the ratio is the number of trousers to the number of shirts. So in this case, 11 trousers and 1 shirt, so the ratio is 11:1.\n\nWait, but let me check if the remaining money allows for more shirts. Let's see, 40 rupees left. Each shirt is 30. So 40 divided by 30 is 1 with a remainder of 10. So only 1 shirt can be bought. So the ratio is 11:1, which would make the number of trousers 11, which is option E.\n\nBut wait, the options are A to E, each giving the number of trousers. So the question is, when he buys the maximum number of trousers, how many does he buy? The options are 9,8,10,7,11. So the correct number is 11, which is option E.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let's make sure that 11 is the maximum. 70*11=770, 70*12=840. 840>810, so yes, 11 is the maximum number of trousers.\n\nAnother approach: Let me model it with an equation. Let t be the number of trousers, and s the number of shirts. The total cost is 70t +30s=810. We want to maximize t, so we'll solve for s in terms of t.\n\n70t +30s =810 \u2192 30s =810 -70t \u2192 s=(810-70t)/30 \u2192 s=27 - (7t/3).\n\nSince s must be an integer >=0, 7t must be divisible by 3.

Because if t isn't a multiple of 3, then 7t might not be divisible by 3, leading s to be a fraction, which isn't allowed.\n\nWait, so perhaps the maximum t is 9, which is a multiple of 3. Let me check: t=9 \u2192 70*9=630. Remaining money 810-630=180. 180/30=6 shirts. So s=6. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the earlier approach. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach. Let me re-examine. If t is 11, then 70*11=770. 810-770=40.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to solve this problem. So, the question is about a man who spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. Trousers cost 70 each and shirts cost 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options given are A to E, each with a certain number of trousers.\n\nHmm, first, I think I should figure out how to maximize the number of trousers he can buy with 810 rupees. Since each trouser is 70 rupees, I'll calculate how many he can buy with the total money.\n\nWait, but he might not be able to spend all the money on trousers because 70 doesn't divide into 810 exactly. Let me check that. Let's divide 810 by 70.\n\n810 divided by 70 is equal to... 810 \u00f7 70 = 11.571... Oh, wait, but he can't buy a fraction of a trouser. So he can buy a maximum of 11 trousers because 11*70 is 770, which is less than 810. But wait, let me calculate 11*70: 70*10=700, plus 70 is 770. So 770 rupees spent on 11 trousers. Then, how much money is left? 810 - 770 = 40 rupees.\n\nBut shirts cost 30 each. Can he buy any shirts with 40 rupees? 40 \u00f730 is 1.333, so he can buy 1 shirt for 30 rupees. That leaves 10 rupees, which isn't enough for another shirt. So total: 11 trousers and 1 shirt. The ratio would be 11:1.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 11 as the number of trousers except option E, which is 11. So is that the maximum? But wait, maybe I should check if buying 10 trousers allows more shirts, but the question is about the maximum number of trousers, so 11 is better.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Maybe I should check if buying 11 trousers and 1 shirt is possible. Because 11*70 is 770, plus 1*30 is 30. Total is 800. 810 minus 800 is 10. So that's correct, he's left with 10. So yes, 11 trousers and 1 shirt.\n\nBut wait, is there another way to spend all 810 rupees? Because 810 is not a multiple of 70. Let me think, maybe if he buys 10 trousers, that would be 700, then the remaining is 110. 110 divided by 30 is 3 shirts (90) with 20 rupees left. So 10 trousers and 3 shirts. So the ratio would be 10:3.\n\nBut the question is asking for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So 11 is more than 10. So the maximum is 11. So the ratio is 11:1. But wait, that's 11 to 1. So the ratio is 11:1.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, the options are the number of trousers, not the ratio. Wait, the question says, \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" Oh, so the ratio is the number of trousers to shirts.\n\nIn the case of 11 trousers and 1 shirt, the ratio is 11:1. So the ratio is 11 to 1. So the options are options A-E, which are the number of trousers. But the question is about the ratio, which is 11:1, so the number of trousers is 11. So the correct option is E, 11.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose he buys 9 trousers. 9*70=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6 shirts. So 9:6 which simplifies to 3:2. But the maximum number of trousers is 11, which is higher than 9.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: Let me model this as an equation. Let x be the number of trousers, y be the number of shirts. So 70x + 30y = 810. We want to maximize x.\n\nWe can write 30y = 810 -70x \u2192 y = (810 -70x)/30. Since y must be an integer and non-negative, (810-70x) must be divisible by 30 and >=0.\n\nSo 810-70x must be divisible by 30. Let's see: 810 is divisible by 30 (810/30=27). 70x must leave a remainder that when subtracted from 810, the result is divisible by 30.\n\nWait, 70x mod 30. 70 mod 30 is 10. So 70x mod30 is (10x) mod30. So 810 mod30 is 0. So 70x must mod30 to 0 as well. So 10x must mod30 be 0. So 10x must be a multiple of 30 \u2192 x must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo x can be 3,6,9,12,... but since 70x can't exceed 810, x can be up to 11 (as 11*70=770, 12*70=840>810). So possible x's are 3,6,9, and maybe 12, but 12 is too much. Wait, 11*70 is 770, which is under 810. So 11 is allowed, but 11 is not a multiple of 3. Hmm, but earlier calculation shows that x=11 is possible, but according to this, x must be a multiple of 3 to make (810-70x) divisible by 30. So perhaps my initial approach was wrong.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So perhaps x must be a multiple of 3 for y to be an integer. Because 70x must be such that (810-70x) is divisible by 30.\n\nWait, 70x mod30 = 70 mod30 is 10. So 70x mod30 = (10x) mod30.\n\nSo 810 mod30 is 0. So 70x mod30 must also be 0. So 10x mod30 =0 \u2192 10x is multiple of 30 \u2192 x is multiple of 3.\n\nSo x must be 3,6,9, etc. But in the initial approach, x=11, which is not a multiple of 3. So when x=11, 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40 is not divisible by 30, so y would be 40/30=1.333, which is not an integer. So that can't be.\n\nWait, this is conflicting with my earlier thought. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Because if x=11, then y= (810-70*11)/30 = (810-770)/30 = 40/30=4/3, which is not an integer. So he can't buy 11 trousers and 1.333 shirts, which is impossible.\n\nSo in reality, he can't buy 11 trousers because that would leave him with 40 rupees, which isn't enough for another shirt (since shirts are 30 each). Wait, but he can buy 1 shirt with 30, leaving 10. So he buys 11 trousers and 1 shirt, but that's 770 +30=800, which is under 810. So he's left with 10, but that's okay because shirts can't be bought with 10.\n\nBut in this case, y=1. So the ratio is 11:1. But according to the equation, y must be an integer, which it is. So maybe the earlier constraint about x being a multiple of 3 is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is in the modulo approach. Let me re-examine. So 70x +30y=810. Let's factor this equation. Both 70 and 30 are divisible by 10. So divide both sides by 10: 7x +3y =81.\n\nNow, the equation is 7x +3y =81. We need x and y to be non-negative integers, and we want to maximize x.\n\nSo we can write this as 3y =81-7x \u2192 y=(81-7x)/3. For y to be integer, 81-7x must be divisible by 3. 81 mod3=0, so 7x mod3 must be 0. Since 7 mod3=1, so 7x mod3= x mod3. So x mod3 must be 0. So x must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo x can be 0,3,6,9, etc., but x can't be more than 81/7, which is about 11.57, so x can be up to 11, but since x must be a multiple of 3, the maximum x is 9. Because 9*7=63, 81-63=18, which is divisible by 3 \u2192 y=6.\n\nWait, but earlier, when x=11, y= (81-77)/3 =4/3 which is not integer. So x=11 is invalid. So the maximum x is 9, which gives y=6. So the ratio is 9:6 \u2192 3:2.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the earlier approach. So where did I go wrong?\n\nI think the error was in the initial approach where I considered buying 11 trousers and 1 shirt without checking if that's a valid solution. Because according to the equation, x must be a multiple of 3 for y to be integer. So the maximum x is 9, not 11.\n\nSo let me re-calculate. If x=9, then y=(81-63)/3=18/3=6. So 9 trousers and 6 shirts. Total cost is 9*70=630, 6*30=180, 630+180=810. That adds up perfectly. So that's a valid solution.\n\nBut earlier, I thought x=11 was possible, but according to the equation, x=11 gives y=4/3, which isn't possible. So why did I think x=11 was possible earlier?\n\nAh, I see. I mistakenly thought that buying 11 trousers and 1 shirt would cost 770+30=800, which is under 810. But according to the equation, that's not a valid solution because y must be integer. So the maximum x is 9, leading to y=6.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question is about the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So 9 is the maximum x that gives an integer y.\n\nSo the options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11.\n\nSo the correct answer is 9 trousers, which is option A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of trousers a man can purchase with 810 rupees, given that each trouser costs 70 rupees and each shirt costs 30 rupees. The goal is to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is bought.\n\n### Step 1: Formulate the equation\nThe total expenditure is given by:\n\\[\n70x + 30y = 810\n\\]\nwhere \\(x\\) is the number of trousers and \\(y\\) is the number of shirts. To maximize \\(x\\), we need to solve for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) such that both are non-negative integers.\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the equation\nDivide the entire equation by 10 to simplify:\n\\[\n7x + 3y = 81\n\\]\nRearranging for \\(y\\):\n\\[\ny = \\frac{81 - 7x}{3}\n\\]\nFor \\(y\\) to be an integer, \\(81 - 7x\\) must be divisible by 3. Since \\(7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\), this implies:\n\\[\nx \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\n\\]\nThus, \\(x\\) must be a multiple of 3.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the maximum \\(x\\)\nThe maximum value of \\(x\\) is constrained by the total budget:\n\\[\n70x \\leq 810 \\implies x \\leq \\frac{810}{70} \\approx 11.57\n\\]\nSince \\(x\\) must be a multiple of 3, the possible values of \\(x\\) are 3, 6, 9. The largest value within this range is \\(x = 9\\).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate \\(y\\) for \\(x = 9\\)\nSubstitute \\(x = 9\\) into the simplified equation:\n\\[\ny = \\frac{81 - 7(9)}{3} = \\frac{81 - 63}{3} = \\frac{18}{3} = 6\n\\]\nThus, when \\(x = 9\\), \\(y = 6\\). This satisfies the total expenditure:\n\\[\n70(9) + 30(6) = 630 + 180 = 810\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Verify other options\n- For \\(x = 11\\), \\(y = \\frac{81 - 7(11)}{3} = \\frac{81 - 77}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}\\), which is not an integer. Hence, \\(x = 11\\) is invalid.\n- For \\(x = 10\\), \\(y = \\frac{81 - 7(10)}{3} = \\frac{81 - 70}{3} = \\frac{11}{3}\\), which is also not an integer. Hence, \\(x = 10\\) is invalid.\n- For \\(x = 8\\) or \\(x = 7\\), similar calculations show that \\(y\\) is not an integer.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nThe maximum number of trousers that can be purchased is \\(x = 9\\), with \\(y = 6\\) shirts. The ratio of trousers to shirts is:\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{9}{6} = 3:2\n\\]\nAmong the given options, the correct answer corresponds to \\(x = 9\\).\n\nAnswer: A",
      "full_content": "Okay, let's try to solve this problem. So, the question is about a man who spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. Trousers cost 70 each and shirts cost 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options given are A to E, each with a certain number of trousers.\n\nHmm, first, I think I should figure out how to maximize the number of trousers he can buy with 810 rupees. Since each trouser is 70 rupees, I'll calculate how many he can buy with the total money.\n\nWait, but he might not be able to spend all the money on trousers because 70 doesn't divide into 810 exactly. Let me check that. Let's divide 810 by 70.\n\n810 divided by 70 is equal to... 810 \u00f7 70 = 11.571... Oh, wait, but he can't buy a fraction of a trouser. So he can buy a maximum of 11 trousers because 11*70 is 770, which is less than 810. But wait, let me calculate 11*70: 70*10=700, plus 70 is 770. So 770 rupees spent on 11 trousers. Then, how much money is left? 810 - 770 = 40 rupees.\n\nBut shirts cost 30 each. Can he buy any shirts with 40 rupees? 40 \u00f730 is 1.333, so he can buy 1 shirt for 30 rupees. That leaves 10 rupees, which isn't enough for another shirt. So total: 11 trousers and 1 shirt. The ratio would be 11:1.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 11 as the number of trousers except option E, which is 11. So is that the maximum? But wait, maybe I should check if buying 10 trousers allows more shirts, but the question is about the maximum number of trousers, so 11 is better.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Maybe I should check if buying 11 trousers and 1 shirt is possible. Because 11*70 is 770, plus 1*30 is 30. Total is 800. 810 minus 800 is 10. So that's correct, he's left with 10. So yes, 11 trousers and 1 shirt.\n\nBut wait, is there another way to spend all 810 rupees? Because 810 is not a multiple of 70. Let me think, maybe if he buys 10 trousers, that would be 700, then the remaining is 110. 110 divided by 30 is 3 shirts (90) with 20 rupees left. So 10 trousers and 3 shirts. So the ratio would be 10:3.\n\nBut the question is asking for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So 11 is more than 10. So the maximum is 11. So the ratio is 11:1. But wait, that's 11 to 1. So the ratio is 11:1.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, the options are the number of trousers, not the ratio. Wait, the question says, \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" Oh, so the ratio is the number of trousers to shirts.\n\nIn the case of 11 trousers and 1 shirt, the ratio is 11:1. So the ratio is 11 to 1. So the options are options A-E, which are the number of trousers. But the question is about the ratio, which is 11:1, so the number of trousers is 11. So the correct option is E, 11.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose he buys 9 trousers. 9*70=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6 shirts. So 9:6 which simplifies to 3:2. But the maximum number of trousers is 11, which is higher than 9.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: Let me model this as an equation. Let x be the number of trousers, y be the number of shirts. So 70x + 30y = 810. We want to maximize x.\n\nWe can write 30y = 810 -70x \u2192 y = (810 -70x)/30. Since y must be an integer and non-negative, (810-70x) must be divisible by 30 and >=0.\n\nSo 810-70x must be divisible by 30. Let's see: 810 is divisible by 30 (810/30=27). 70x must leave a remainder that when subtracted from 810, the result is divisible by 30.\n\nWait, 70x mod 30. 70 mod 30 is 10. So 70x mod30 is (10x) mod30. So 810 mod30 is 0. So 70x must mod30 to 0 as well. So 10x must mod30 be 0. So 10x must be a multiple of 30 \u2192 x must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo x can be 3,6,9,12,... but since 70x can't exceed 810, x can be up to 11 (as 11*70=770, 12*70=840>810). So possible x's are 3,6,9, and maybe 12, but 12 is too much. Wait, 11*70 is 770, which is under 810. So 11 is allowed, but 11 is not a multiple of 3. Hmm, but earlier calculation shows that x=11 is possible, but according to this, x must be a multiple of 3 to make (810-70x) divisible by 30. So perhaps my initial approach was wrong.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So perhaps x must be a multiple of 3 for y to be an integer. Because 70x must be such that (810-70x) is divisible by 30.\n\nWait, 70x mod30 = 70 mod30 is 10. So 70x mod30 = (10x) mod30.\n\nSo 810 mod30 is 0. So 70x mod30 must also be 0. So 10x mod30 =0 \u2192 10x is multiple of 30 \u2192 x is multiple of 3.\n\nSo x must be 3,6,9, etc. But in the initial approach, x=11, which is not a multiple of 3. So when x=11, 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40 is not divisible by 30, so y would be 40/30=1.333, which is not an integer. So that can't be.\n\nWait, this is conflicting with my earlier thought. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Because if x=11, then y= (810-70*11)/30 = (810-770)/30 = 40/30=4/3, which is not an integer. So he can't buy 11 trousers and 1.333 shirts, which is impossible.\n\nSo in reality, he can't buy 11 trousers because that would leave him with 40 rupees, which isn't enough for another shirt (since shirts are 30 each). Wait, but he can buy 1 shirt with 30, leaving 10. So he buys 11 trousers and 1 shirt, but that's 770 +30=800, which is under 810. So he's left with 10, but that's okay because shirts can't be bought with 10.\n\nBut in this case, y=1. So the ratio is 11:1. But according to the equation, y must be an integer, which it is. So maybe the earlier constraint about x being a multiple of 3 is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is in the modulo approach. Let me re-examine. So 70x +30y=810. Let's factor this equation. Both 70 and 30 are divisible by 10. So divide both sides by 10: 7x +3y =81.\n\nNow, the equation is 7x +3y =81. We need x and y to be non-negative integers, and we want to maximize x.\n\nSo we can write this as 3y =81-7x \u2192 y=(81-7x)/3. For y to be integer, 81-7x must be divisible by 3. 81 mod3=0, so 7x mod3 must be 0. Since 7 mod3=1, so 7x mod3= x mod3. So x mod3 must be 0. So x must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo x can be 0,3,6,9, etc., but x can't be more than 81/7, which is about 11.57, so x can be up to 11, but since x must be a multiple of 3, the maximum x is 9. Because 9*7=63, 81-63=18, which is divisible by 3 \u2192 y=6.\n\nWait, but earlier, when x=11, y= (81-77)/3 =4/3 which is not integer. So x=11 is invalid. So the maximum x is 9, which gives y=6. So the ratio is 9:6 \u2192 3:2.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the earlier approach. So where did I go wrong?\n\nI think the error was in the initial approach where I considered buying 11 trousers and 1 shirt without checking if that's a valid solution. Because according to the equation, x must be a multiple of 3 for y to be integer. So the maximum x is 9, not 11.\n\nSo let me re-calculate. If x=9, then y=(81-63)/3=18/3=6. So 9 trousers and 6 shirts. Total cost is 9*70=630, 6*30=180, 630+180=810. That adds up perfectly. So that's a valid solution.\n\nBut earlier, I thought x=11 was possible, but according to the equation, x=11 gives y=4/3, which isn't possible. So why did I think x=11 was possible earlier?\n\nAh, I see. I mistakenly thought that buying 11 trousers and 1 shirt would cost 770+30=800, which is under 810. But according to the equation, that's not a valid solution because y must be integer. So the maximum x is 9, leading to y=6.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question is about the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So 9 is the maximum x that gives an integer y.\n\nSo the options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11.\n\nSo the correct answer is 9 trousers, which is option A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of trousers a man can purchase with 810 rupees, given that each trouser costs 70 rupees and each shirt costs 30 rupees.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm a bit new to these types of questions, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: A man spends 810 rupees buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are A to E, each giving a number of trousers, like 9, 8, etc.\n\nHmm, so the goal is to maximize the number of trousers he buys, right? Because the question says when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So, that makes sense. He wants as many trousers as possible within 810 rupees.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. Let me define variables. Let's say the number of trousers is T and shirts is S. Each trouser costs 70, each shirt 30. So the total cost is 70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nWe need to maximize T, so we should spend as much as possible on trousers and then see how many shirts we can get with the remaining money. Or maybe we can express S in terms of T and find possible integer solutions.\n\nWait, but since T and S must be whole numbers (you can't buy a fraction of a shirt or trouser), we'll have to find integer solutions to the equation 70T + 30S = 810.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation. Maybe solve for S. So,\n\n30S = 810 -70T\n\nSo S = (810 -70T)/30.\n\nSimplify that. Let's see, 810 divided by 30 is 27, and 70 divided by 30 is 7/3. So,\n\nS = (27*30 -70T)/30 = 27 - (70T/30) \u2192 27 - (7T/3).\n\nWait, that's S = 27 - (7T/3). But S must be an integer. So (7T/3) must also be an integer because 27 is an integer and S is integer.\n\nSo 7T must be divisible by 3. Since 7 and 3 are coprime (no common factors), T must be a multiple of 3. So T can be 3, 6, 9, etc., but subject to the total cost not exceeding 810.\n\nWait, but let's also think about the maximum T possible. Because 70*T can't exceed 810.\n\nSo maximum T is when S is zero: 70*T = 810 \u2192 T=810/70 \u224811.57. So the maximum integer T possible is 11, but let's check if that's possible.\n\nWait, if T is 11, then the cost on trousers is 70*11=770. Then the remaining money is 810-770=40. Now, shirts are 30 each. So 40 /30 is 1.333... So you can't buy 1.333 shirts. So S would have to be 1, but that uses 30 rupees, leaving 10, which isn't enough for another shirt. So T=11 would give S=1, but let's check if that's allowed.\n\nBut wait, let's go back to the equation S = (810 -70T)/30. For T=11, S=(810 -770)/30 = 40/30 = 4/3 \u22481.333. Not an integer. So that's not acceptable. So T=11 is not a valid option.\n\nSo the next lower T that is a multiple of 3. Wait, earlier I thought T must be a multiple of 3 because 7T must be divisible by 3. So let's try T=9.\n\nT=9: 70*9=630. Remaining money is 810-630=180. So S=180/30=6. That works. So S=6. So the ratio of T:S is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but the options are giving the number of trousers, not the ratio. The question is about the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So perhaps the options are the number of trousers, and we're to find the ratio.\n\nWait, but the options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11. So perhaps each option is the number of trousers, and we have to see which one is the maximum possible.\n\nWait, but when T is 11, we saw that S isn't an integer. So that's not acceptable. So the next possible T is 9, which gives S=6. But wait, what about T=10? Let's check T=10.\n\nT=10: 70*10=700. Remaining 810-700=110. 110 /30 is 3.666... which is not integer. So S=3, but that uses 90, leaving 20. So that's not acceptable.\n\nWhat about T=8? 70*8=560. Remaining 250. 250/30 is 8.333... So S=8, which is 240, leaving 10. That's not acceptable. So S=8 is possible, but that leaves some money unused. So in that case, T=8, S=8.\n\nWait, but 70*8 +30*8=560 +240=800. That's 10 rupees left. So that's not optimal because we could spend more. So the man could spend all 810 if possible.\n\nWait, perhaps T=9 is better. Because 70*9=630, and 30*6=180. 630+180=810. So that uses all the money. So that's better because he's not leaving any money.\n\nSo the maximum number of trousers he can buy is 9. So the ratio of T:S is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but the options are giving the number of trousers, and the question is asking for the ratio. So perhaps the question is phrased a bit differently. Wait, the question says, \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\"\n\nSo the options are giving the number of trousers, and we need to pick the correct number, which is 9, as that's the maximum number of trousers possible without leftover money.\n\nWait, but in the options, 9 is option A, 11 is E, but 11 isn't possible because it doesn't result in an integer number of shirts. So the correct answer would be 9, option A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's see, when T=9, S=6, which uses exactly 810. So that's the maximum possible T without any leftover money. So the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2. But the question is asking for the ratio, but the options are giving the number of trousers.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm a bit new to these types of questions, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: A man spends 810 rupees buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are A to E, each giving a number of trousers, like 9, 8, etc.\n\nHmm, so the goal is to maximize the number of trousers he buys, right? Because the question says when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So, that makes sense. He wants as many trousers as possible within 810 rupees.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. Let me define variables. Let's say the number of trousers is T and shirts is S. Each trouser costs 70, each shirt 30. So the total cost is 70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nWe need to maximize T, so we should spend as much as possible on trousers and then see how many shirts we can get with the remaining money. Or maybe we can express S in terms of T and find possible integer solutions.\n\nWait, but since T and S must be whole numbers (you can't buy a fraction of a shirt or trouser), we'll have to find integer solutions to the equation 70T + 30S = 810.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation. Maybe solve for S. So,\n\n30S = 810 -70T\n\nSo S = (810 -70T)/30.\n\nSimplify that. Let's see, 810 divided by 30 is 27, and 70 divided by 30 is 7/3. So,\n\nS = (27*30 -70T)/30 = 27 - (70T/30) \u2192 27 - (7T/3).\n\nWait, that's S = 27 - (7T/3). But S must be an integer. So (7T/3) must also be an integer because 27 is an integer and S is integer.\n\nSo 7T must be divisible by 3. Since 7 and 3 are coprime (no common factors), T must be a multiple of 3. So T can be 3, 6, 9, etc., but subject to the total cost not exceeding 810.\n\nWait, but let's also think about the maximum T possible. Because 70*T can't exceed 810.\n\nSo maximum T is when S is zero: 70*T = 810 \u2192 T=810/70 \u224811.57. So the maximum integer T possible is 11, but let's check if that's possible.\n\nWait, if T is 11, then the cost on trousers is 70*11=770. Then the remaining money is 810-770=40. Now, shirts are 30 each. So 40 /30 is 1.333... So you can't buy 1.333 shirts. So S would have to be 1, but that uses 30 rupees, leaving 10, which isn't enough for another shirt. So T=11 would give S=1, but let's check if that's allowed.\n\nBut wait, let's go back to the equation S = (810 -70T)/30. For T=11, S=(810 -770)/30 = 40/30 = 4/3 \u22481.333. Not an integer. So that's not acceptable. So T=11 is not a valid option.\n\nSo the next lower T that is a multiple of 3. Wait, earlier I thought T must be a multiple of 3 because 7T must be divisible by 3. So let's try T=9.\n\nT=9: 70*9=630. Remaining money is 810-630=180. So S=180/30=6. That works. So S=6. So the ratio of T:S is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but the options are giving the number of trousers, not the ratio. The question is about the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So perhaps the options are the number of trousers, and we're to find the ratio.\n\nWait, but the options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11. So perhaps each option is the number of trousers, and we have to see which one is the maximum possible.\n\nWait, but when T is 11, we saw that S isn't an integer. So that's not acceptable. So the next possible T is 9, which gives S=6. But wait, what about T=10? Let's check T=10.\n\nT=10: 70*10=700. Remaining 810-700=110. 110 /30 is 3.666... which is not integer. So S=3, but that uses 90, leaving 20. So that's not acceptable.\n\nWhat about T=8? 70*8=560. Remaining 250. 250/30 is 8.333... So S=8, which is 240, leaving 10. That's not acceptable. So S=8 is possible, but that leaves some money unused. So in that case, T=8, S=8.\n\nWait, but 70*8 +30*8=560 +240=800. That's 10 rupees left. So that's not optimal because we could spend more. So the man could spend all 810 if possible.\n\nWait, perhaps T=9 is better. Because 70*9=630, and 30*6=180. 630+180=810. So that uses all the money. So that's better because he's not leaving any money.\n\nSo the maximum number of trousers he can buy is 9. So the ratio of T:S is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but the options are giving the number of trousers, and the question is asking for the ratio. So perhaps the question is phrased a bit differently. Wait, the question says, \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\"\n\nSo the options are giving the number of trousers, and we need to pick the correct number, which is 9, as that's the maximum number of trousers possible without leftover money.\n\nWait, but in the options, 9 is option A, 11 is E, but 11 isn't possible because it doesn't result in an integer number of shirts. So the correct answer would be 9, option A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's see, when T=9, S=6, which uses exactly 810. So that's the maximum possible T without any leftover money. So the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2. But the question is asking for the ratio, but the options are giving the number of trousers. Hmm, perhaps I misread the question.\n\nWait, the question says, \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So the options are the number of trousers.

We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers possible.\n\nHmm, wait, the maximum number of trousers. So, he wants as many trousers as he can buy with 810 rupees, and then see how many shirts he can get with the remaining money. Then, the ratio would be the number of trousers to the number of shirts.\n\nLet me think about how to set this up. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. The total cost is 70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nBut since we want the maximum number of trousers, we need to maximize T. That means we should spend as much as possible on trousers, and then use the leftover money for shirts.\n\nSo, the maximum T is when the remaining money after buying T trousers can still buy at least one shirt. Wait, no, not necessarily. Because maybe the remaining money could be zero, but that's not possible because you have to buy some shirts. Or maybe he can choose to buy zero shirts if possible, but the problem doesn't specify that he must buy at least one of each. Hmm, but I think the problem implies he buys both because otherwise, the question about the ratio wouldn't make sense if S is zero.\n\nWait, the problem says he buys trousers and shirts, so he must buy at least one of each. So, S must be at least 1.\n\nSo, the approach is: find the maximum T such that 70*T \u2264 810 - 30*S, and S is at least 1.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to model this as an equation. Let's say he buys T trousers and S shirts.\n\n70T + 30S = 810.\n\nWe need to maximize T. So, we can rearrange the equation to find S in terms of T.\n\n30S = 810 -70T\nS = (810 -70T)/30.\n\nBut since S must be an integer (can't buy a fraction of a shirt), (810 -70T) must be divisible by 30. Alternatively, 70T must be such that when subtracted from 810, the result is a multiple of 30.\n\nLet me think about this. 70T must be congruent to 810 mod 30. Let's compute 810 mod 30 first.\n\n810 divided by 30 is 27 with no remainder, so 810 mod 30 is 0. So 70T mod 30 must also be 0.\n\nWait, 70 mod 30 is 10, because 70 divided by 30 is 2 with a remainder of 10. So 70T mod30 is equal to (10*T) mod30.\n\nSo, 10T \u2261 0 mod30.\n\nWhich implies that 10T must be a multiple of 30. So, 10T =30k, where k is an integer.\n\nDivide both sides by 10: T =3k.\n\nSo T must be a multiple of 3. So possible T values are 3,6,9,12,... but we can't exceed the maximum possible T.\n\nWhat's the maximum possible T without considering S? Let's see. If all the money is spent on trousers, T_max = 810 /70.\n\nCalculating that: 70*11=770, 70*12=840 which is more than 810. So maximum possible T without considering shirts is 11. But since he needs to buy at least one shirt, we have to subtract at least 30 from 810.\n\nSo 810 -70T >=30.\n\nWait, let me think again. The total cost equation is 70T +30S=810. Since S must be at least 1, 30S must be at least 30.\n\nSo 70T <= 810 -30 =780.\n\nSo 70T <=780.\n\nT <=780/70 = approximately 11.14. So T can be up to 11, but let's check if T=11 is possible.\n\nIf T=11, then the cost is 70*11=770. Remaining money is 810-770=40. So S=40/30=1.333... which is not an integer. So S can't be 1.333, which is invalid.\n\nSo T=11 is not possible because it would leave 40, which isn't enough for an additional shirt (since each shirt is 30, but 40/30 isn't an integer). So S would have to be 1, but 70*11 +30*1 = 770 +30=800, which is less than 810. So he has 10 left, which isn't enough to buy another shirt. So he can't buy 11 trousers.\n\nWait, but the problem states that he spends exactly 810, so 70T +30S must equal 810.\n\nSo, let's try T=11:\n\n70*11 =770. 810-770=40. 40 isn't divisible by 30, so S isn't an integer. So T=11 is invalid.\n\nNext, try T=10.\n\n70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 /30 is 3.666... which is not integer. So S=3.666 isn't possible.\n\nNext, T=9.\n\n70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. So S=6. That works.\n\nSo when T=9, S=6. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nBut wait, the options don't give a ratio, they just give the number of trousers. The question is, what is the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased.\n\nWait, the options are A)9, B)8, etc. So the correct answer is the number of trousers, which in this case is 9, option A.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there are any higher T possible. Because maybe there's a T that's a multiple of 3 higher than 9 but less than 11.\n\nWait, 9 is a multiple of 3, next would be 12, which is higher than 11, so it's not possible. So 9 is the maximum T possible that allows S to be an integer.\n\nAlternatively, let's check if T=12 is possible. No, because 70*12=840>810. So 12 is too much.\n\nWait another approach: Let's model this as a linear Diophantine equation.\n\nWe have 70T +30S =810.\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 10: 7T +3S =81.\n\nWe can solve for integer T and S >=1.\n\nWe can rearrange this as 3S =81 -7T.\n\nSo 81-7T must be divisible by 3 and positive.\n\n7T must be less than 81. So T < 81/7 \u224811.57. So T can be up to 11.\n\nWe need 81 -7T to be divisible by 3.\n\nLet's compute 81 mod3=0. 7 mod3=1. So 7T mod3 = T mod3.\n\nSo 81-7T mod3 must be 0. So 0 - (T mod3) \u22610 mod3. So T mod3 must be 0.\n\nThus, T must be a multiple of 3, as I thought earlier.\n\nSo possible T values are 3,6,9.\n\nWait, wait, no: 3,6,9,12, etc., but T can't be more than 11.\n\nSo possible T's are 3,6,9.\n\nBut wait, 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. So S=6.\n\nFor T=6: 70*6=420. 810-420=390. 390/30=13. S=13.\n\nFor T=3: 70*3=210. 810-210=600. 600/30=20. S=20.\n\nBut wait, are there higher T's possible beyond 9 that are multiples of 3? No, because 12 is over 11.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought T=9 is the maximum, but let's see. Could there be a higher T beyond 9 but not a multiple of 3?\n\nWait, but according to the equation, T must be a multiple of 3. Because 81-7T must be divisible by 3. So T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo the maximum T possible is 9.\n\nSo when T=9, S=6.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6, which can be simplified to 3:2.\n\nBut the question is asking for the ratio of trouser to shirt when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the number of trousers is 9, shirts 6.\n\nThe options are only about the number of trousers. So the correct answer is 9, which is option A.\n",

Since S must be at least 1, 30S must be at least 30.\n\nSo 70T <= 810 -30 =780.\n\nSo 70T <=780.\n\nT <=780/70 = approximately 11.14. So T can be up to 11, but let's check if T=11 is possible.\n\nIf T=11, then the cost is 70*11=770. Remaining money is 810-770=40. So S=40/30=1.333... which is not an integer. So S can't be 1.333, which is invalid.\n\nSo T=11 is not possible because it would leave 40, which isn't enough for an additional shirt (since each shirt is 30, but 40/30 isn't an integer). So S would have to be 1, but 70*11 +30*1 = 770 +30=800, which is less than 810. So he has 10 left, which isn't enough to buy another shirt. So he can't buy 11 trousers.\n\nWait, but the problem states that he spends exactly 810, so 70T +30S must equal 810.\n\nSo, let's try T=11:\n\n70*11 =770. 810-770=40. 40 isn't divisible by 30, so S isn't an integer. So T=11 is invalid.\n\nNext, try T=10.\n\n70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 /30 is 3.666... which is not integer. So S=3.666 isn't possible.\n\nNext, T=9.\n\n70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. So S=6. That works.\n\nSo when T=9, S=6. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nBut wait, the options don't give a ratio, they just give the number of trousers. The question is, what is the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased.\n\nWait, the options are A)9, B)8, etc. So the correct answer is the number of trousers, which in this case is 9, option A.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there are any higher T possible. Because maybe there's a T that's a multiple of 3 higher than 9 but less than 11.\n\nWait, 9 is a multiple of 3, next would be 12, which is higher than 11, so it's not possible. So 9 is the maximum T possible that allows S to be an integer.\n\nAlternatively, let's check if T=12 is possible. No, because 70*12=840>810. So 12 is too much.\n\nWait another approach: Let's model this as a linear Diophantine equation.\n\nWe have 70T +30S =810.\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 10: 7T +3S =81.\n\nWe can solve for integer T and S >=1.\n\nWe can rearrange this as 3S =81 -7T.\n\nSo 81-7T must be divisible by 3 and positive.\n\n7T must be less than 81. So T < 81/7 \u224811.57. So T can be up to 11.\n\nWe need 81 -7T to be divisible by 3.\n\nLet's compute 81 mod3=0. 7 mod3=1. So 7T mod3 = T mod3.\n\nSo 81-7T mod3 must be 0. So 0 - (T mod3) \u22610 mod3. So T mod3 must be 0.\n\nThus, T must be a multiple of 3, as I thought earlier.\n\nSo possible T values are 3,6,9.\n\nWait, wait, no: 3,6,9,12, etc., but T can't be more than 11.\n\nSo possible T's are 3,6,9.\n\nBut wait, 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. So S=6.\n\nFor T=6: 70*6=420. 810-420=390. 390/30=13. S=13.\n\nFor T=3: 70*3=210. 810-210=600. 600/30=20. S=20.\n\nBut wait, are there higher T's possible beyond 9 that are multiples of 3? No, because 12 is over 11.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought T=9 is the maximum, but let's see. Could there be a higher T beyond 9 but not a multiple of 3?\n\nWait, but according to the equation, T must be a multiple of 3. Because 81-7T must be divisible by 3. So T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo the maximum T possible is 9.\n\nSo when T=9, S=6.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6, which can be simplified to 3:2.\n\nBut the question is asking for the ratio of trouser to shirt when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the number of trousers is 9, shirts 6.\n\nThe options are only about the number of trousers. So the correct answer is 9, which is option A.\n\n\nTo determine the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased, we start with the total expenditure equation:\n\n\\[\n70T + 30S = 810\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(T\\) represents the number of trousers and \\(S\\) represents the number of shirts. The goal is to maximize \\(T\\) while ensuring \\(S\\) is an integer and \\(S \\geq 1\\).\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the equation\nDivide the entire equation by 10 to simplify:\n\n\\[\n7T + 3S = 81\n\\]\n\nRearranging for \\(S\\):\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{81 - 7T}{3}\n\\]\n\nFor \\(S\\) to be an integer, \\(81 - 7T\\) must be divisible by 3. Since \\(7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\), \\(7T \\equiv T \\pmod{3}\\). Thus, \\(T\\) must be a multiple of 3 to satisfy the condition \\(81 - 7T \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\\).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the maximum \\(T\\)\nThe maximum possible \\(T\\) is constrained by the total expenditure. If all 810 rupees were spent on trousers:\n\n\\[\nT_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{810}{70} \\approx 11.57\n\\]\n\nSince \\(T\\) must be an integer, the maximum possible \\(T\\) is 11. However, \\(T\\) must also be a multiple of 3. Thus, the possible values for \\(T\\) are 3, 6, 9.\n\n### Step 3: Check valid combinations\n- For \\(T = 9\\):  \n  \\[\n  70(9) = 630 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 810 - 630 = 180\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  S = \\frac{180}{30} = 6\n  \\]\n  This is valid, with \\(T = 9\\) and \\(S = 6\\).\n\n- For \\(T = 12\\):  \n  \\[\n  70(12) = 840 > 810\n  \\]\n  This exceeds the total expenditure, so \\(T = 12\\) is invalid.\n\nThus, the maximum valid \\(T\\) is 9, with \\(S = 6\\).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the ratio\nThe ratio of trousers to shirts is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{T}{S} = \\frac{9}{6} = 3:2\n\\]\n\nHowever, the question only asks for the number of trousers when the maximum number is purchased. Therefore, the answer is \\(T = 9\\).\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about a man who spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. Trousers cost 70 each and shirts cost 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are given as letters, each corresponding to a number of trousers.\n\nHmm, so the key here is that he spends exactly 810 rupees, and we want to maximize the number of trousers. That makes sense because if we buy as many trousers as possible, the remaining money would go towards shirts. So, the goal is to find how many trousers he can buy without exceeding 810, and then see how many shirts that leaves him with.\n\nLet me think about the math here. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. The total cost equation would be:\n\n70*T + 30*S = 810\n\nWe need to find integer values of T and S that satisfy this equation, and T should be as large as possible.\n\nSo, rearranging the equation to solve for S:\n\n30*S = 810 -70*T\nS = (810 -70*T)/30\n\nSimplify that. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 10:\n\nS = (81 -7*T)/3\n\nSince S must be an integer, the numerator (81 -7*T) must be divisible by 3. So, 81 -7T should be a multiple of 3.\n\nWait, 81 is 3^4, so it's divisible by 3. So, 7T must also be such that 81 -7T is divisible by 3. Let's see: 7 mod 3 is 1, because 7/3 is 2 with remainder 1. So, 7T mod 3 is equal to (1 * T mod 3). \n\nSo, 81 mod 3 is 0, so (0 - T mod 3) must be 0. So, T mod 3 should be 0. That is, T must be a multiple of 3. Because if T is a multiple of 3, then 7T mod 3 is (1*0) mod 3 =0, so 81-7T is 0 mod 3, making S an integer.\n\nSo T has to be a multiple of 3. But we also need to make sure that the total cost doesn't exceed 810, and that S is non-negative.\n\nSo, let's find the maximum possible T such that 70*T \u2264 810, and T is a multiple of 3.\n\nLet's compute 810 /70 to find the maximum possible T without considering the multiple of 3 condition. 70*11 is 770, which is less than 810. 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So maximum possible T without considering the multiple is 11. But 11 is not a multiple of 3. The largest multiple of 3 less than or equal to 11 is 9, since 9*3=27, 9*3=27, wait, no, 3*3=9, 3*4=12, which is beyond 11. So the next lower multiple is 9. Wait, 9 is 3*3, but 11 is larger than 9. Wait, I think I made a mistake.\n\nWait, 810 /70 is approximately 11.57. So the maximum T without considering the multiple is 11, but since 11 isn't a multiple of 3, we have to go down to the next lower multiple. The next lower multiple of 3 is 9 (since 12 is 12, which is higher than 11, so 9 is the next lower). Wait, 9 is less than 11, so that's the maximum T that's a multiple of 3.\n\nWait, but let me check. Let's compute 70*9=630. Then the remaining money is 810-630=180. Then S =180/30=6 shirts. So that's possible.\n\nBut wait, can we have a higher T than 9? Let's see, like 10. 10 isn't a multiple of 3. Let's test T=10.\n\n70*10=700. Then 810-700=110. Then S=110/30=3.666..., which isn't an integer. So that's not possible. So T can't be 10.\n\nWhat about T=11? 70*11=770. Remaining is 810-770=40. 40/30 is 1.333... which is not an integer. So S is not an integer here either. So T=11 is not acceptable.\n\nHmm, so the next possible T is 9, which gives S=6. But wait, is 9 the maximum possible T that is a multiple of 3? Let's think about this again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The condition is that (81-7T) must be divisible by 3. So 81-7T \u2261 0 mod3.\n\nSince 7 mod3 is 1, 7T mod3 is T mod3. So 81 mod3 is 0, so 0 - T mod3 must be 0. So T mod3 must be 0. So T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo, possible values of T are 0,3,6,9,12,... but 12 would be 70*12=840, which is over 810. So maximum T is 9.\n\nSo T=9, which gives S=6. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the ratio of trousers to shirts. So it's 9:6, which is 3:2. So the options given are about the number of trousers, but perhaps the ratio is 3:2, but the question is about the maximum number of trousers, which is 9.\n\nWait, looking at the options, option A is 9 trousers. So the correct answer would be A.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm. Let me compute for T=9: 9*70=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6 shirts. So yes, that works.\n\nWhat about T=12? 70*12=840>810. So no.\n\nAnother approach: Let's try all T values starting from 11 down and see which gives S as integer.\n\nT=11: 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40/30=1.333... Not integer. So no.\n\nT=10:70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110/30=3.666... No.\n\nT=9: 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. So yes.\n\nT=8:70*8=560. 810-560=250. 250/30=8.333... Not integer.\n\nT=7:70*7=490. 810-490=320. 320/30=10.666... Not integer.\n\nSo yes, T=9 is the maximum number of trousers that can be bought with 810, giving 6 shirts.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6, which reduces to 3:2. But the question is about the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased, so the number of trousers is 9, so the answer is option A.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here. Let me read it again. A man spends 810 rupees buying trousers and shirts. Each trouser costs 70 rupees and each shirt is 30 rupees. I need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are from A to E, with the number of trousers ranging from 7 to 11.\n\nHmm, so the goal is to maximize the number of trousers. That makes sense because the question says maximum number of trousers. So, I should probably find out how many trousers he can buy with 810 rupees, and then see how many shirts he can get with the remaining money.\n\nLet me think. Let\u2019s denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S. The total cost is 70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nBut we want to maximize T, so I need to find the maximum possible integer value of T such that the remaining money can buy some number of shirts (which should also be an integer). \n\nSo, the equation is 70T + 30S = 810.\n\nI can rearrange this equation to solve for S. Let's see:\n\n30S = 810 -70T\nS = (810 -70T)/30\n\nS has to be an integer because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So (810 -70T) must be divisible by 30. Let me check the divisibility.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to find the maximum T where 70*T is less than or equal to 810, and then check if (810 -70T) is divisible by 30.\n\nWait, but 70*T must be less than or equal to 810, so T_max_possible is 810 /70. Let me calculate that.\n\n810 divided by 70 is 11.571... So the maximum integer T can be 11. But wait, let me check if T=11 is possible.\n\nSo, T=11: 70*11=770. Then the remaining money is 810-770=40. Now, 40 divided by 30 is 1.333... which isn't an integer. So S would be 1 and 1/3, which is impossible. So T=11 isn't possible because S isn't an integer.\n\nSo next, try T=10. 70*10=700. Remaining money is 810-700=110. 110 /30 is 3.666..., which is also not integer. So S=3.666, which isn't allowed. So T=10 is not possible.\n\nNext, T=9. 70*9=630. Remaining is 810-630=180. 180 /30=6. So S=6. That's an integer. So with T=9, S=6. So that works.\n\nWait, but are there any higher T values between 9 and 11 that work? Let's see. We tried 11 and 10, and they didn't work. So 9 is the next.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check all possibilities. Let me see, perhaps T=8?\n\nWait, no, because we're trying to maximize T, so after 9, the next is 10 and 11 which we tried. So T=9 is the maximum possible.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me think about the equation again.\n\nSo 70T +30S=810.\n\nWe can divide the entire equation by 10 to make it simpler: 7T +3S =81.\n\nSo 7T +3S=81.\n\nWe need T and S to be integers, and T as large as possible.\n\nSo 7T =81-3S.\n\nWe can rearrange this as T = (81 -3S)/7.\n\nSince T must be an integer, (81 -3S) must be divisible by 7.\n\nSo 81 mod 7 is... 7*11=77, 81-77=4. So 81 mod7 is 4.\n\nSo 81-3S \u2261 0 mod7.\n\nWhich implies 3S \u22614 mod7.\n\nWe can write this as 3S \u22614 mod7.\n\nWe need to find S such that 3S mod7 is 4.\n\nLet me find S mod7.\n\n3S \u22614 mod7.\n\nMultiply both sides by the modular inverse of 3 mod7. The inverse of 3 mod7 is 5 because 3*5=15\u22611 mod7.\n\nSo S \u22614 *5 mod7 \u2192 S \u226120 mod7 \u2192 20 mod7 is 6. So S \u22616 mod7.\n\nSo S can be 6,13,20, etc. But since the total is 81, let's find possible S.\n\nWe have 3S \u226481 \u2192 S \u226427.\n\nSo possible S values are 6,13,20,27.\n\nLet me check each of these.\n\nFirst S=6.\n\nThen, 3*6=18. 81-18=63. 63/7=9. So T=9.\n\nWhich is the case we found earlier.\n\nNext, S=13: 3*13=39. 81-39=42. 42/7=6 \u2192 T=6. So T=6.\n\nBut we're looking for maximum T, so T=9 is better.\n\nNext S=20: 3*20=60. 81-60=21 \u2192 21/7=3 \u2192 T=3.\n\nLower than 9.\n\nS=27: 3*27=81 \u2192 81-81=0 \u2192 T=0. Not useful, since we want maximum T.\n\nSo the possible S values are 6,13,20,27, with T=9,6,3,0 respectively.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9, with S=6.\n\nSo the ratio of T:S is 9:6, which can be simplified to 3:2.\n\nBut the question isn't asking for the ratio in simplified terms; it's asking for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So when T=9, S=6. So the ratio is 9:6, but in the options, they probably just want the number of trousers, which is option A)9.\n\nWait, but the options are A to E, each giving a certain number of trousers, not the ratio. Wait, looking back, the question says: \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the question again.\n\nAh, the question says, \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So the ratio is T:S, which is 9:6 or 3:2. But the options are just the number of trousers, like option A is 9, etc. Hmm, perhaps I misread the question. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the question is asking for the ratio, but the options are giving only the number of trousers. Oh wait, no. Wait, the options are labeled as \"A)9 Trousers\", which I think is the number of trousers purchased. But the question is about the ratio of trousers to shirts. So perhaps the options are not the ratio but the number of trousers.\n\nWait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-examine.\n\nThe question says: What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\n\nSo the ratio is T:S, but the options are A)9 Trousers, which is probably the number of trousers, not the ratio. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the options are giving the number of trousers, and the question is asking for that, not the ratio.\n\nWait, no, the question says 'the ratio of trouser and shirt' so it's the ratio of T to S.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are giving the ratio, but the way they're written is confusing. Let me look again.\n\nThe options are labeled as A)9 Trousers, etc. So each option is a number of trousers, not a ratio. So perhaps the question is actually asking for the maximum number of trousers purchased, not the ratio. Because the options are all numbers of trousers.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the question. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question is: What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\n\nAh, wait, perhaps the ratio is being represented as the number of trouser to the number of shirt. So for each option, the number is the number of trousers, but the ratio would be T:S.\n\nBut the options are just giving the number of trousers. So perhaps the question is actually asking for the maximum number of trousers, not the ratio. Because the options are numbers of trousers, not ratios.\n\nWait, that could be possible. So perhaps the initial understanding was wrong, and the question is asking for the maximum number of trousers possible, regardless of the ratio.\n\nIn that case, the problem becomes: find the maximum T such that 70T +30S =810, where S is an integer \u22650.\n\nSo, maximum T is 810//70=11, but 70*11=770, 810-770=40, which is not divisible by 30. So T=11 not possible.\n\nT=10: 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110/30=3.666\u2026 not integer. So S=3.666 invalid.\n\nT=9: 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. So S=6. So T=9 is possible.\n\nT=9 is the maximum number of trousers possible. So the answer would be 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but the initial problem statement says \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So perhaps the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2. But the options don't list ratios, they list the number of trousers. So perhaps the question is asking for the maximum number of trousers, which is 9.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, a man spends 810 rupees buying trousers and shirts. The trousers are each 70 rupees and the shirts are each 30 rupees. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. Oh, wait, and the options are given as different numbers of trousers, like 9,8,10 etc. So the answer is probably one of those.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The total money spent is 810. Each trouser costs 70, each shirt 30. Let me denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S. So the equation would be 70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nBut the question is about the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So to maximize T, I need to find the maximum possible T such that the remaining money can be used to buy shirts, which are cheaper. \n\nWait, but I also need to make sure that S is a whole number because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So the problem becomes solving for T and S where 70*T + 30*S =810, and T is as large as possible, with S being an integer.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation. Let's write S in terms of T. So, 30*S = 810 -70*T. Then S = (810 -70*T)/30. Simplify that.\n\nLet's compute (810 -70T)/30. 810 divided by 30 is 27, and 70/30 is 7/3. So S = 27 - (7/3)*T.\n\nBut S has to be a whole number. So (7/3)*T must be an integer because 27 is an integer and S is integer. So 7T must be divisible by 3, meaning T must be a multiple of 3. Because 7 and 3 are coprime (no common factors besides 1). So T has to be a multiple of 3. Let's think about that.\n\nSo possible T values are 3,6,9,12,... but we can't go beyond the total money. Let's find the maximum T possible.\n\nLet me find the maximum T where 70*T \u2264810. So 810/70 is approximately 11.57. So maximum possible T is 11. But wait, since T has to be a multiple of 3, the next lower multiple of 3 is 9. Because 11 is not a multiple of 3. Let me check.\n\nWait, wait. Let's compute 70*11: 70*11=770. 810-770=40. Then S=40/30=1.333... which isn't an integer. So that's no good. So T can't be 11.\n\nSo next, let's try T=9. 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. So S=6. That works. So T=9, S=6. \n\nBut wait, are there higher T values that are multiples of 3 beyond 9 but less than or equal to 11.57? Let's see, 9 is a multiple of 3. Next is 12, but 12*70=840>810. So no. So 9 is the maximum possible T.\n\nSo the ratio is T:S = 9:6. Let's simplify that. Both divide by 3, so 3:2. But the question asks for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the ratio would be 3:2, but the question might just be looking for the number of trousers, which is 9. Wait, looking back at the options, the options are A)9, B)8, etc. So the correct answer is 9, option A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any possible T. Let me try T=12: 70*12=840>810. So no. T=10: 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110/30=3.666... which is not integer. So no. T=11: as before, 770. 810-770=40, 40/30=1.333, no. So next lower T is 9. \n\nSo yes, T=9 is the maximum possible. So the ratio is 9 trousers to 6 shirts, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question is about the ratio of trouser to shirt, so 9:6, which reduces to 3:2. But the options are about the number of trousers, so the answer is 9, which is option A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by setting up the equation for the total cost:  \n\\[\n70T + 30S = 810\n\\]  \nwhere \\(T\\) is the number of trousers and \\(S\\) is the number of shirts.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, a man spends 810 rupees buying trousers and shirts. The trousers are each 70 rupees and the shirts are each 30 rupees. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. Oh, wait, and the options are given as different numbers of trousers, like 9,8,10 etc. So the answer is probably one of those.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The total money spent is 810. Each trouser costs 70, each shirt 30. Let me denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S. So the equation would be 70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nBut the question is about the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So to maximize T, I need to find the maximum possible T such that the remaining money can be used to buy shirts, which are cheaper. \n\nWait, but I also need to make sure that S is a whole number because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So the problem becomes solving for T and S where 70*T + 30*S =810, and T is as large as possible, with S being an integer.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation. Let's write S in terms of T. So, 30*S = 810 -70*T. Then S = (810 -70*T)/30. Simplify that.\n\nLet's compute (810 -70T)/30. 810 divided by 30 is 27, and 70/30 is 7/3. So S = 27 - (7/3)*T.\n\nBut S has to be a whole number. So (7/3)*T must be an integer because 27 is an integer and S is integer. So 7T must be divisible by 3, meaning T must be a multiple of 3. Because 7 and 3 are coprime (no common factors besides 1). So T has to be a multiple of 3. Let's think about that.\n\nSo possible T values are 3,6,9,12,... but we can't go beyond the total money. Let's find the maximum T possible.\n\nLet me find the maximum T where 70*T \u2264810. So 810/70 is approximately 11.57. So maximum possible T is 11. But wait, since T has to be a multiple of 3, the next lower multiple of 3 is 9. Because 11 is not a multiple of 3. Let me check.\n\nWait, wait. Let's compute 70*11: 70*11=770. 810-770=40. Then S=40/30=1.333... which isn't an integer. So that's no good. So T can't be 11.\n\nSo next, let's try T=9. 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. So S=6. That works. So T=9, S=6. \n\nBut wait, are there higher T values that are multiples of 3 beyond 9 but less than or equal to 11.57? Let's see, 9 is a multiple of 3. Next is 12, but 12*70=840>810. So no. So 9 is the maximum possible T.\n\nSo the ratio is T:S = 9:6. Let's simplify that. Both divide by 3, so 3:2. But the question asks for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the ratio would be 3:2, but the question might just be looking for the number of trousers, which is 9. Wait, looking back at the options, the options are A)9, B)8, etc. So the correct answer is 9, option A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any possible T. Let me try T=12: 70*12=840>810. So no. T=10: 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110/30=3.666... which is not integer. So no. T=11: as before, 770. 810-770=40, 40/30=1.333, no. So next lower T is 9. \n\nSo yes, T=9 is the maximum possible. So the ratio is 9 trousers to 6 shirts, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question is about the ratio of trouser to shirt, so 9:6, which reduces to 3:2. But the options are about the number of trousers, so the answer is 9, which is option A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by setting up the equation for the total cost:  \n\\[\n70T + 30S = 810\n\\]  \nwhere \\(T\\) is the number of trousers and \\(S\\) is the number of shirts. The goal is to maximize \\(T\\) while ensuring \\(S\\) is an integer. Rearranging the equation gives:  \n\\[\nS = \\frac{810 - 70T}{30}\n\\]  \nSimplifying further:  \n\\[\nS = 27 - \\frac{7}{3}T\n\\]  \nFor \\(S\\) to be an integer, \\(\\frac{7}{3}T\\) must also be an integer.
