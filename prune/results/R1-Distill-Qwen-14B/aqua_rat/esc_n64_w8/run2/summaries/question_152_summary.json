      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a candidate's exam marks. Let me try to understand what's being asked. Hmm, the candidate scored 504 marks out of a maximum M. Then, if M is converted into 800 marks, the candidate would have 420. I need to find M.\n\nWait, let me parse that again. So originally, the maximum is M, and the candidate's score is 504. Then, when M is converted to 800, their score becomes 420. So this seems like a proportion problem, right? Because when the total marks change, the candidate's score changes proportionally.\n\nSo, I think I can set up a ratio here. The candidate's marks over the maximum marks should be the same in both cases because it's just a scaling. So 504/M should equal 420/800. Because the ratio of their score to the maximum remains the same.\n\nLet me write that as an equation: 504 / M = 420 / 800. Now, I need to solve for M. To do that, I can cross-multiply. So, 504 * 800 = 420 * M.\n\nWait, let me compute both sides. Let's see, 504 multiplied by 800. Hmm, 504 * 800. Let me break that down. 504 * 8 is 4032, so 504 * 800 is 403200. On the other side, 420 * M. So 420M = 403200.\n\nSo M would be 403200 divided by 420. Let me compute that. 403200 / 420. Hmm, let's see. 420 goes into 403200 how many times? Let's see, 420 times 1000 is 420000. Oh, wait, that's bigger than 403200. So maybe 960? Because 420 * 960 = let's see, 420*900=378000, and 420*60=25200. Adding those together gives 403200. Oh, right! So M is 960.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 960. So that's the answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me check the cross-multiplication again. 504 * 800 equals 403200, yes. 420 times 960 is indeed 403200. So yes, M is 960. So option E is correct.\n",

Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe problem states that a candidate scored 504 marks in an exam, and the maximum possible mark is M. Then, if this maximum M is converted into 800 marks, the candidate's score would be 420. I need to find the value of M. The options are A to E, and I think I'll have to set up an equation or something.\n\nHmm, wait. So the candidate got 504 marks out of M. If the maximum M is converted to 800, then the candidate's score would be 420. So it's like scaling the marks. I think this is about proportion or ratios.\n\nLet me think of it this way: the candidate's percentage or proportion of the total marks should remain the same after converting M to 800. So, 504/M is the same as 420/800. Oh right, because when you scale the maximum, the actual score scales proportionally.\n\nSo setting up the equation: 504 / M = 420 / 800.\n\nWait, is that correct? Because if M is the original maximum, and it's converted to 800, the candidate's score would be 504 multiplied by (800/M), right? Because when you change the maximum, the actual score scales accordingly. So 504 * (800/M) = 420.\n\nYes, that makes more sense. Because when you increase the maximum, the candidate's actual marks would also increase proportionally. So the formula is 504 * (800/M) = 420.\n\nLet me write that equation again:\n\n504 * (800 / M) = 420.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, because when you convert M to 800, the candidate's score is 420. So 504 is to M as 420 is to 800. So 504/M = 420/800. That's the same as before.\n\nWait, so either way, the equation is the same. Because 504/M = 420/800, so cross-multiplying would give me 504 * 800 = 420 * M.\n\nYes, that seems right. So solving for M:\n\nM = (504 * 800) / 420.\n\nLet me compute that. Let's see, 504 divided by 420 is... 504 \u00f7 420. Let me see, 420 times 1 is 420, 420 times 1.2 is 504. So 504/420 = 1.2. So 1.2 * 800 = 960. So M is 960.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 960. So that must be the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Because sometimes I get confused with ratios. Let me make sure.\n\nOriginal scenario: candidate scored 504 out of M. So the ratio is 504/M.\n\nAfter scaling M to 800, the candidate's score is 420. So the new ratio is 420/800.\n\nIf these ratios are equal, then 504/M = 420/800.\n\nCross-multiplying: 504 * 800 = 420 * M.\n\nCompute 504*800: 504 * 800. Let's see, 500*800 is 400,000. 4*800 is 3,200. So total is 403,200.\n\nSo 403,200 = 420 * M.\n\nSo M = 403200 / 420.\n\nLet me compute that. 420 goes into 403200 how many times?\n\nWell, 420 * 1000 is 420,000, which is more than 403,200. So 420 * 960 is 420*(900+60)= 378,000 + 25,200 = 403,200. Oh! So yes, M is 960.\n\nSo the correct answer is E)960.\n",

Then, if this maximum M is converted into 800 marks, the candidate would have scored 420. I need to find the value of M. The options are A to E, with numbers like 278, 2890, 270, etc.\n\nHmm. So, I think this is a proportion problem. Because when the total maximum changes from M to 800, the candidate's score also changes proportionally from 504 to 420. So, the ratio of the candidate's score to the maximum should remain the same before and after the conversion.\n\nWait, let me think about that. So the candidate's actual performance is a fraction of the total possible. So when the total changes, their score adjusts accordingly. So the ratio 504/M should be equal to 420/800. That makes sense because the candidate's performance relative to the maximum doesn't change; only the maximum does.\n\nSo, setting up the equation: 504 / M = 420 / 800.\n\nNow, I can solve for M.

So 504*800=403200.\n\nOn the right side, 420 * M. So 403200 = 420 * M.\n\nNow, I need to solve for M. So M equals 403200 divided by 420.\n\nWait, what's 403200 divided by 420? Let me calculate that.\n\nHmm, 420 times 900 is 378,000. Because 420 * 900 = (400*900)+(20*900)=360,000 +18,000=378,000. Then, 403200 -378000=25200. Now, 420 * 60 =25,200. So 900+60=960.

Well, 420 goes into 504 once with 84 remaining. So 504/420 = 1.2, because 420 * 1.2 = 504. Alternatively, 504 \u00f7 420 = (504 \u00f7 84)/(420 \u00f784) =6/5 =1.2.\n\nSo, 504/420=1.2.

The options are A) 278, B) 2890, C) 270, D) 2702, E) 960.\n\nHmm, so I'm trying to find M, the original maximum mark. The candidate scored 504 in that system. But when the maximum is changed to 800, his score becomes 420. So I think this is a problem about scaling or converting marks from one scale to another.\n\nLet me think about ratios. Because when you change the maximum, the actual performance is scaled proportionally. So the ratio of his score to the maximum remains the same in both cases.\n\nSo, in the first case, the candidate's score is 504 out of M. In the second case, it's 420 out of 800. The ratio of his marks to the maximum should be equal in both scenarios.\n\nSo I can set up an equation: 504 / M = 420 / 800.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because the proportion of the marks he got doesn't change when the total is scaled.\n\nNow, I can solve for M. Let me rearrange the equation.\n\nCross-multiplying, I get 504 * 800 = 420 * M.\n\nWait, let me write that down:\n\n504 * 800 = 420 * M.\n\nSo M would be (504 * 800) / 420.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, let's calculate 504 * 800. 504 multiplied by 800. Hmm, 504 * 800 is the same as 504 * 8 * 100.\n\n504 * 8 is 4032, because 500*8=4000 and 4*8=32, so 4032. Multiply by 100 gives 403200.\n\nSo 504 * 800 = 403200.\n\nThen, divide that by 420. So M = 403200 / 420.\n\nLet me compute that division. Hmm, 403200 divided by 420.\n\nWait, perhaps I can simplify this fraction before calculating. Let's see if both numerator and denominator can be divided by a common factor.\n\nLooking at 403200 and 420, both are divisible by 420. Let me see how many times 420 goes into 403200.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps breaking it down:\n\n420 is 42 * 10. So 403200 divided by 420 is (403200 / 42) / 10.\n\nWhat's 403200 divided by 42? Let's compute that.\n\n42 * 9600 = 403200, because 42 * 9600 = (40 * 9600) + (2 * 9600) = 384000 + 19200 = 403200.\n\nWait, 42 times 9600 is 403200. So 403200 / 42 is 9600.\n\nThen, divide by 10, so 9600 / 10 is 960.\n\nWait, so M is 960? Let me check the options. Option E is 960. So is that correct?\n\nWait, but let me double-check my math because 960 seems a bit high, but maybe it's correct.\n\nWait, another approach: 420 is 504 divided by 1.2. Because 504 / 420 = 1.2. So 420 is 504 / 1.2. So if 504 is to M as 420 is to 800, then M = (504 * 800) / 420. Which is what I did earlier, leading to 960.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When the maximum is converted from M to 800, the candidate's score also changes. So the ratio of the candidate's score to the new maximum is the same as the ratio of the original score to the original maximum.\n\nSo, 504/M = 420/800.\n\nYes, that's correct. So M would be (504 * 800) / 420 = 960.\n\nSo option E is 960, which would be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method. Let's compute 504 divided by M equals 420 divided by 800.\n\nSo, 504 / M = 420 / 800.\n\nLet me compute 420/800 first. 420 divided by 800 is 0.525.\n\nSo 504 / M = 0.525. So M is 504 / 0.525.\n\nLet me compute that. 504 divided by 0.525.\n\nHmm, 0.525 is the same as 21/40. So 504 divided by (21/40) is 504 * (40/21).\n\nCompute 504 /21 first. 21 *24=504, because 21*20=420, 21*4=84, 420+84=504. So 504/21=24.\n\nThen multiply by 40: 24 *40=960. So M is 960.\n\nYes, same result. So the correct answer is E)960.\n",

Then multiply by 100, so 403200.\n\nOn the other side, 420 * M = 420M.\n\nSo 403200 = 420M.\n\nTo find M, divide both sides by 420: M = 403200 / 420.\n\nLet me compute that. 403200 divided by 420.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can simplify the division. Both numerator and denominator can be divided by 420's factors. Let's see:\n\n420 = 42 * 10 = 6*7*10. Let me see if 420 divides into 403200 evenly.\n\nAlternatively, I can do it step by step. 420 times 1000 is 420,000. But 403,200 is less than that. So 403,200 divided by 420.\n\nLet me divide numerator and denominator by 10 first: 40320 / 42.\n\n40320 divided by 42. Let's compute that.\n\n42 goes into 40320 how many times?\n\n42 * 900 = 37800. Subtract that from 40320: 40320 -37800 = 2520.\n\n42 *60=2520. So 900+60=960. So 40320 /42=960.\n\nSo M=960. Let me check the options.\n\nLooking at the options: E is 960. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nSo, 504/M = 420/800. Cross-multiply: 504*800=420*M.\n\n504 *800: 504*8=4032, so 4032 *100=403200.\n\n420*M=403200 \u2192 M=403200 /420.\n\n420 is 42*10. 403200 divided by 420: 403200 \u00f7420.\n\n403200 \u00f7420 = (403200 \u00f710) \u00f742 =40320 \u00f742.\n\n40320 \u00f742: Let me compute this another way. 42 * 960 = 40320? Let's see. 42 *900=37800. 42 *60=2520. 37800+2520=40320. Yes, correct. So M is 960.\n\nSo the correct option is E) 960.\n\n\nThe candidate's score is initially 504 out of a maximum mark \\( M \\). When \\( M \\) is converted to 800, the candidate's score becomes 420. Since the candidate's performance remains the same, the ratios of their scores to the maximum marks must be equal:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{504}{M} = \\frac{420}{800}.\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\n\\[\n504 \\times 800 = 420 \\times M.\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\( 504 \\times 800 \\):\n\n\\[\n504 \\times 800 = 504 \\times 8 \\times 100 = 4032 \\times 100 = 403200.\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( 420 \\times M = 403200 \\). Solving for \\( M \\):\n\n\\[\nM = \\frac{403200}{420}.\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the division:\n\n\\[\n403200 \\div 420 = 960.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( M \\) is **960**, which corresponds to option **E**.\n\nAnswer: E",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that a candidate secured 504 marks out of a maximum M. If M is converted into 800 marks, he would have secured 420. I need to find the value of M.\n\nHmm, wait. So the candidate's score is 504 when the maximum is M. But if M is changed to 800, his score becomes 420. I think this means that the candidate's actual performance is being scaled to a new maximum. So, perhaps the ratio of his marks to the maximum remains the same in both cases. Oh right, because if M changes, his actual score would adjust proportionally.\n\nLet me think. The initial scenario: the candidate scored 504 out of M. So the ratio is 504/M. When M is converted to 800, his score becomes 420 out of 800. So the ratio would be 420/800. Since the performance ratio should be the same, I can set up an equation.\n\nSo 504/M = 420/800. That makes sense because the proportion of marks achieved remains constant when scaling the maximum.\n\nNow I can solve for M. Let me write that equation again:\n\n504 / M = 420 / 800.\n\nI can cross-multiply to solve for M. So, 420 * M = 504 * 800.\n\nWait, let me compute the right side first. 504 multiplied by 800. Let's see, 504 * 800. Well, 500 * 800 is 400,000, and 4 * 800 is 3,200. So adding those together, 403,200.\n\nSo, 420 * M = 403,200.\n\nNow, to find M, I divide both sides by 420. So M = 403,200 / 420.\n\nLet me calculate that. Hmm, 420 goes into 403,200 how many times?\n\nWell, 420 * 1000 is 420,000, which is a bit more than 403,200. So let's see, 403,200 divided by 420.\n\nWait, 420 is 42 * 10, so maybe it's easier to divide 403200 by 420.\n\nAlternatively, I can simplify the fraction 403200/420.\n\nLet me see. Both numerator and denominator can be divided by 20? Wait, 420 divided by 20 is 21. 403,200 divided by 20 is 20,160.\n\nSo now it's 20,160 / 21.\n\nHmm, 21 times 960 is 20,160 because 21 * 900 is 18,900, and 21 * 60 is 1,260. 18,900 + 1,260 is 20,160.\n\nSo 20,160 /21 = 960. So M is 960.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option E is 960. So that would be the answer.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So 504 divided by M equals 420 divided by 800. Cross-multiplying: 504 * 800 = 420 * M.\n\n504 *800: let me compute that again. 504 * 8 is 4032, so 504 * 800 is 403200. Then, 420*M=403200, so M=403200/420.\n\nLet me compute 403200 divided by 420. Let's see, 420 * 960 is 403200 because 420 *900 is 378,000, 420 *60 is 25,200. 378,000 +25,200 is 403,200.
