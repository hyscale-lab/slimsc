      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a shopkeeper and discounts. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. So the shopkeeper gave a 20% discount on all items for one day, and now he wants to sell them back at the original price the next day. The question is asking by what percentage he must increase the discounted price to get back to the original price. I think I need to calculate the required percentage increase.\n\nWait, let's break it down. Let's assume the original price of an item is, say, $100. That makes the calculations easier. So if the original price is $100, a 20% discount would reduce the price by $20. So the discounted price is $80. Right?\n\nNow, the next day, the shopkeeper wants to sell it back to the original price of $100. But he's currently selling it at $80. So he needs to increase the $80 back to $100. The question is, what percentage increase is needed on the discounted price to reach the original?\n\nI remember that percentage increase is calculated as (Increase / Original) \u00d7 100%. Here, the increase is the difference between the new price and the discounted price. So the increase is $100 - $80 = $20. The original here is the discounted price, which is $80.\n\nSo plugging into the formula: (20 / 80) \u00d7 100% = 25%. Oh wait, so that's a 25% increase. So the correct answer should be 25%, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If you take 20% off, the item is 80. To get back to 100, you need to add 25% of 80. Because 25% of 80 is 20, and adding that to 80 gives 100. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it with variables. Let the original price be P. After a 20% discount, the price becomes P * (1 - 0.20) = 0.8P. Now, to get back to P from 0.8P, the increase needed is (P - 0.8P) = 0.2P. The percentage increase is (0.2P / 0.8P) * 100% = (0.25) * 100% = 25%. So again, 25% increase is needed.\n\nSo looking at the options, option C is 25%. So the answer should be C.\n",

Let me read it again. \n\nThe question says that a shopkeeper gave a 20% discount on all items for one day. Now, the next day, he wants to sell them at the original price again. The question is asking by what percentage he must increase the discounted price to get back to the original price. The options are A) 21%, B)20%, C)25%, D)33%, E)18%.\n\nHmm, okay. So, the problem is about percentage increase after a discount. I think I need to calculate the percentage increase needed to bring the price back to its original value after a 20% discount. \n\nLet me break it down. Let's say the original price of an item is $100. I choose 100 because percentages are easier to work with that way. So, on the first day, he gives a 20% discount. 20% of 100 is 20, so the discounted price is 80 dollars. \n\nNow, the next day, he wants to sell it at the original price, which is 100. So, he needs to increase the 80 dollar price to 100. How much of an increase is that?\n\nThe increase in dollars is 20 (from 80 to 100). To find the percentage increase relative to the discounted price, I think I need to divide the increase by the discounted price and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage. \n\nSo, the formula would be: (Increase / Original after discount) * 100. Wait, no, wait. The increase is from the discounted price, so the base for the percentage is the discounted price, which is 80. So, 20 divided by 80 equals 0.25. Multiply by 100 gives 25%. \n\nSo the percentage increase needed is 25%. Looking at the options, that's option C. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me try with a different number. Suppose the original price was $50. 20% off would be 10 dollars, so the price becomes 40. To get back to 50, he needs an increase of 10. 10 divided by 40 is 0.25, so again 25%. Yep, same result. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of variables. Let the original price be P. After a 20% discount, the price is P*(1-0.20) = 0.8P. To find the percentage increase needed to bring it back to P, we set up the equation: 0.8P * (1 + x) = P. Solving for x: (1 + x) = P / (0.8P) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So x = 0.25, which is 25%. \n\nSo yeah, that's consistent. So the answer should be C)25%.\n",

So yes, 25% is correct.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage increase needed to return to the original price after a 20% discount, let's assume the original price of an item is 100. \n\n1. **Calculate the discounted price**:  \n   A 20% discount on 100 is 20, so the discounted price is:  \n   \\[\n   100 - 20 = 80\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the percentage increase required to return to the original price**:  \n   The formula for percentage increase is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{New Value} - \\text{Original Value}}{\\text{Original Value}}\\right) \\times 100\n   \\]  \n   Here, the \"New Value\" is the original price (100), and the \"Original Value\" is the discounted price (80). Substituting these values:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left(\\frac{100 - 80}{80}\\right) \\times 100 = \\left(\\frac{20}{80}\\right) \\times 100 = 0.25 \\times 100 = 25\\%\n   \\]\n\n3. **Verify the calculation**:  \n   Adding 25% of 80 to 80 gives:  \n   \\[\n   80 + (0.25 \\times 80) = 80 + 20 = 100\n   \\]  \n   This confirms the calculation is correct.\n\nThus, the shopkeeper must increase the discounted price by **25%** to return to the original price. The correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: C",

I need to find out by what percentage he should increase the discounted price to get back to the original. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. Suppose the original price of an item is, say, $100. It's easy to work with 100 because percentages are straightforward. So if the original price is $100, a 20% discount would be 20% of 100. 20% of 100 is 20, right? So the discounted price would be 100 minus 20, which is $80.\n\nNow, the shopkeeper wants to sell it back at the original price of $100 the next day. But the current price is $80. So he needs to increase $80 back to $100. The question is, what's the percentage increase from 80 to 100?\n\nWait, percentage increase is calculated based on the original amount, which in this case is the discounted price, which is $80. So the increase needed is 100 - 80 = $20. So the increase is $20 on the $80 base.\n\nTo find the percentage, I take (20 / 80) * 100. Let me calculate that. 20 divided by 80 is 0.25. Multiply by 100 gives 25%. So the shopkeeper needs to increase the price by 25% to get back to the original price.\n\nWait a second, why can't it just be 20% again? Because 20% of 80 is 16, which would make the price 96, not 100. So that's not enough. So the percentage has to be higher than 20% because the base is lower now.\n\nLet me try another way. Suppose the original price is P. After a 20% discount, the price becomes P * (1 - 0.20) = 0.8P. Now, to get back to P from 0.8P, the increase needed is (P - 0.8P) = 0.2P. The percentage increase is (0.2P / 0.8P) * 100% = (0.25) * 100% = 25%. Yep, that matches what I found earlier.\n\nSo the correct answer should be 25%, which is option C.\n",

Hmm, I need to figure out by what percentage he must increase the discounted price to get back to the original. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, let's say the original price of an item is $100. That makes the calculations easier, right? So if the original price is $100 and there's a 20% discount, the discounted price would be 20% less than 100.\n\nWait, 20% of 100 is 20, so the discounted price is 100 - 20 = $80. Got that down. Now, the next day, the shopkeeper wants to sell it back at the original price of $100. So he needs to take the $80 price and increase it by some percentage to get back to $100.\n\nWait, so the question is, what percentage increase from $80 will bring it back to $100? Oh right, because 80 plus some percentage of 80 equals 100. So I can set up an equation for that.\n\nLet me denote the required percentage increase as x. So, mathematically, it would be:\n\n80 + (x/100)*80 = 100\n\nHmm, simplifying that. Let's subtract 80 from both sides:\n\n(x/100)*80 = 20\n\nSo, x/100 = 20 / 80. Let me calculate 20 divided by 80. Oh, 20 divided by 80 is 0.25. So x/100 = 0.25, which means x = 0.25 * 100 = 25. So x is 25%.\n\nWait, that makes sense because a 25% increase on $80 would be 80 * 0.25 = 20, and 80 +20 = 100, which is the original price. So the correct percentage is 25%. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 25%. So the answer should be C.\n\nAnother way to think about it: when you have a discount and then need to reverse it, the percentage increase needed isn't the same as the discount percentage. Because the base changes. So a 20% decrease brings it to 80, and to get back, you're adding 20 to 80, which is a 25% increase from the discounted price.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a shopkeeper who gave a 20% discount and now needs to increase the price back to the original. Hmm, I need to figure out by what percentage he must increase the discounted price to get back to the original. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, let's say the original price of an item is $100. That makes the calculations easier, right? So if the original price is $100 and there's a 20% discount, the discounted price would be 20% less than 100.\n\nWait, 20% of 100 is 20, so the discounted price is 100 - 20 = $80. Got that down. Now, the next day, the shopkeeper wants to sell it back at the original price of $100. So he needs to take the $80 price and increase it by some percentage to get back to $100.\n\nWait, so the question is, what percentage increase from $80 will bring it back to $100? Oh right, because 80 plus some percentage of 80 equals 100. So I can set up an equation for that.\n\nLet me denote the required percentage increase as x. So, mathematically, it would be:\n\n80 + (x/100)*80 = 100\n\nHmm, simplifying that. Let's subtract 80 from both sides:\n\n(x/100)*80 = 20\n\nSo, x/100 = 20 / 80. Let me calculate 20 divided by 80. Oh, 20 divided by 80 is 0.25. So x/100 = 0.25, which means x = 0.25 * 100 = 25. So x is 25%.\n\nWait, that makes sense because a 25% increase on $80 would be 80 * 0.25 = 20, and 80 +20 = 100, which is the original price. So the correct percentage is 25%. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 25%. So the answer should be C.\n\nAnother way to think about it: when you have a discount and then need to reverse it, the percentage increase needed isn't the same as the discount percentage. Because the base changes. So a 20% decrease brings it to 80, and to get back, you're adding 20 to 80, which is a 25% increase from the discounted price.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage increase needed to return the discounted price to the original price, let the original price be $100. After a 20% discount, the price becomes:\n\n\\[\n100 - 0.20 \\times 100 = 80\n\\]\n\nThe shopkeeper now needs to increase this discounted price of $80 back to the original price of $100. Let the required percentage increase be \\( x \\). The equation for the increase is:\n\n\\[\n80 + \\frac{x}{100} \\times 80 = 100\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 80 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{100} \\times 80 = 20\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{100} = \\frac{20}{80} = 0.25\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\nx = 0.25 \\times 100 = 25\\%\n\\]\n\nThis means a 25% increase on the discounted price of $80 will bring it back to the original price of $100. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: C**",
