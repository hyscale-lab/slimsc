      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: If m is greater than 0, y is greater than 0, and x is m percent of 4y. Then, in terms of y, m is what percentage of x? The options are A to E.\n\nHmm, I think I should start by writing down what each part means. So, x is m percent of 4y. I remember that when something is a certain percentage of another, you can express it as a decimal times that number. So m percent would be m/100, right?\n\nSo, x equals (m/100) times 4y. Let me write that as an equation: x = (m/100) * 4y. That simplifies to x = (4m y)/100, or maybe I can write that as x = (m * 4y)/100. Wait, perhaps simplifying it more, x = (4 m y) / 100.\n\nBut I'm supposed to find m as a percentage of x. So, the question is asking, m is what percentage of x? So, that would be (m / x) * 100%, right?\n\nWait, let me think. When you want to find A is what percentage of B, it's (A/B)*100. So in this case, A is m and B is x. So the formula is (m / x) * 100%.\n\nOkay, so I have x expressed in terms of m and y. So I can substitute x into this expression.\n\nSo, x is (4 m y)/100. So, m divided by x would be m divided by [(4 m y)/100]. Let me write that down: m / [ (4 m y)/100 ].\n\nHmm, let's compute that. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So that's m * (100 / (4 m y)).\n\nWait, the m in the numerator and the m in the denominator should cancel out, right? So m * (100/(4 m y)) becomes (100)/(4 y) because the m's cancel.\n\nSimplify that: 100 divided by 4 is 25. So, 25/y. Then, since we're looking for a percentage, we multiply by 100%, so (25/y) * 100%?\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, because I had (m/x) * 100%, which after substitution became [100/(4 y)] * 100%? Or did I make a mistake in the steps?\n\nWait, let's go back. So, m is what percentage of x. So, (m / x) * 100.\n\nWe have x = (4 m y) / 100.\n\nSo m / x = m / [ (4 m y) / 100 ].\n\nThat's m * [100 / (4 m y)].\n\nThe m in numerator and denominator cancel, so we have 100/(4 y).\n\n100 divided by 4 is 25, so 25 / y.\n\nSo that's (25/y) * 100%? Wait, no, because m/x is (25/y), and then we multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nWait, wait no, m/x is 25/y. So 25/y times 100% is 2500/y percent.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the units don't fit. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's go step by step.\n\nx is m percent of 4y.\n\nSo, x = (m/100) * 4y.\n\nWhich is x = (4 m y) / 100.\n\nSo, x = (4 m y)/100.\n\nNow, m is what percentage of x? So, (m / x) * 100%.\n\nSubstitute x:\n\nm / [(4 m y)/100] * 100%.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nSo, m divided by (4 m y / 100) is equal to m * (100/(4 m y)).\n\nThe m in numerator and denominator cancels, so it's (100)/(4 y).\n\n100 divided by 4 is 25, so 25/(y).\n\nThen, multiply by 100% because the question is asking for percentage.\n\nWait, wait, no. Because (m/x) *100% is (25/y) *100%.\n\nSo that's 2500/y percent.\n\nWait, but let me check that again.\n\nWait, m/x is 25/y. So, 25/y multiplied by 100% is (25 *100)/y % = 2500/y %.\n\nSo, m is 2500/y percent of x.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 2500/y. So the correct answer would be D.\n\nWait, let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) y/400\n\nB)4y\n\nC)50y\n\nD)2500/y\n\nE)5000/y\n\nYes, option D is 2500/y, which matches what I calculated.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe I messed up the multiplication. Let me go through it again.\n\nm/x is 25/y.\n\nSo, (25/y) *100% is 2500/y %.\n\nSo, m is 2500/y percent of x.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be D.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says: If m is greater than 0, y is greater than 0, and x is m percent of 4y, then in terms of y, m is what percentage of x? The options are A through E, and I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nHmm, okay, let's break this down. First, let's translate the words into mathematical equations because that usually helps me understand the relationships better.\n\nThe first part says x is m percent of 4y. So, percentages can be tricky, but I remember that \"A is B percent of C\" translates to A = (B/100) * C. So applying that here, x would be equal to (m/100) multiplied by 4y. Let me write that down:\n\nx = (m/100) * 4y.\n\nSimplify that a bit. The 4 and the 100 can be multiplied together. 4 divided by 100 is 0.04, but wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, (m/100) *4y is the same as (4m y)/100, which can be written as (m y)/25 because 4 divided by 100 is 1/25. Wait, no, 4 divided by 100 is 0.04, but I think I should keep it as fractions to make it clearer.\n\nSo x = (4m y) / 100. That's another way to write it.\n\nNow, the question is asking for m as a percentage of x. So, in other words, what is m in terms of a percentage of x? So, mathematically, that would be (m / x) * 100%. Because when you want to find what percent A is of B, it's (A/B)*100%.\n\nSo I need to compute (m / x) * 100. Let's plug in the expression we have for x into this.\n\nFrom earlier, x = (4m y)/100. So substituting that into the percentage calculation:\n\n(m / x) * 100 = (m / ( (4m y)/100 )) * 100.\n\nHmm, let me compute this step by step. Let's handle the division first. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So:\n\nm divided by ( (4m y)/100 ) equals m * (100 / (4m y)).\n\nSo that becomes (100 m) / (4 m y). Oh wait, the m terms can be canceled out. Since m is greater than 0, it's safe to divide.\n\nSo, the m in the numerator and denominator cancels, leaving 100/(4 y).\n\n100 divided by 4 is 25. So 100/(4 y) is 25/y.\n\nBut wait, that's only the division part. Then, we multiply by 100, right? Because the formula was (m/x)*100.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me recheck that. The entire expression is (m/x)*100. So the division gives us 25/(y), and then we multiply by 100? No, wait, no. Wait, let me go back.\n\nWait, no. Let me retrace. So, (m/x) is (m divided by x), which is m divided by (4m y / 100), which is m multiplied by (100/(4m y)). The m's cancel, so it's 100/(4 y) = 25/(y). Then, since the overall expression is (m/x) * 100, wait no\u2014no, wait, no. Wait, no. Let me see. Because (m/x) is 25/(y), and then we multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nWait no, wait. Let's clarify. The formula is (m / x) * 100%. So m divided by x, multiplied by 100.\n\nSo, when I computed (m / x), I got 25/(y). So (25/y) * 100 is 2500/y.\n\nSo the percentage is 2500 divided by y.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, D is 2500/y and E is 5000/y. So that would make D the correct answer, right?\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the algebra.\n\nStarting again: x is m% of 4y. So x = (m/100) * 4y \u2192 x = (4 m y)/100.\n\nWe want m as a percentage of x. So m is what percent of x? That's (m / x) * 100.\n\nSubstitute x: (m / (4 m y / 100 )) * 100.\n\nSimplify denominator: 4 m y /100 is x.\n\nSo m divided by (4 m y /100) is m * (100)/(4 m y) \u2192 (100 m)/(4 m y) \u2192 100/(4 y) \u2192 25/(y).\n\nThen, multiply by 100: (25/y) * 100 = 2500/y.\n\nSo the percentage is 2500/y, which is option D.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up any steps. Let me pick some numbers to test.\n\nLet's say y is 10. Then, let's choose m as 50 (just a number greater than 0). Then, x is 50% of 4*10.\n\n4*10 is 40. 50% of 40 is 20. So x is 20.\n\nNow, the question is m is what percentage of x. So m is 50, x is 20.\n\nPercentage is (50/20)*100 = 250%.\n\nAccording to our formula, 2500/y. Since y is 10, 2500/10 is 250. So the answer would be 250%, which matches our test case.\n\nSo the calculation seems correct. Thus, the answer is D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says: If m is greater than 0, y is greater than 0, and x is m percent of 4y, then in terms of y, m is what percentage of x? The options are A through E, and I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nHmm, okay, let's break this down. First, let's translate the words into mathematical equations because that usually helps me understand the relationships better.\n\nThe first part says x is m percent of 4y. So, percentages can be tricky, but I remember that \"A is B percent of C\" translates to A = (B/100) * C. So applying that here, x would be equal to (m/100) multiplied by 4y. Let me write that down:\n\nx = (m/100) * 4y.\n\nSimplify that a bit. The 4 and the 100 can be multiplied together. 4 divided by 100 is 0.04, but wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, (m/100) *4y is the same as (4m y)/100, which can be written as (m y)/25 because 4 divided by 100 is 1/25. Wait, no, 4 divided by 100 is 0.04, but I think I should keep it as fractions to make it clearer.\n\nSo x = (4m y) / 100. That's another way to write it.\n\nNow, the question is asking for m as a percentage of x. So, in other words, what is m in terms of a percentage of x? So, mathematically, that would be (m / x) * 100%. Because when you want to find what percent A is of B, it's (A/B)*100%.\n\nSo I need to compute (m / x) * 100. Let's plug in the expression we have for x into this.\n\nFrom earlier, x = (4m y)/100. So substituting that into the percentage calculation:\n\n(m / x) * 100 = (m / ( (4m y)/100 )) * 100.\n\nHmm, let me compute this step by step. Let's handle the division first. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So:\n\nm divided by ( (4m y)/100 ) equals m * (100 / (4m y)).\n\nSo that becomes (100 m) / (4 m y).

So x is 20.\n\nNow, the question is m is what percentage of x. So m is 50, x is 20.\n\nPercentage is (50/20)*100 = 250%.\n\nAccording to our formula, 2500/y. Since y is 10, 2500/10 is 250.

Let me compute that.\n\nDividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So, m / (4 m y / 100) is m * (100 / (4 m y)).\n\nWait, let's see. So, m divided by (4 m y /100) is m * (100/(4 m y)). The m's in numerator and denominator will cancel out.

So, x is m percent of 4y. I think that translates to an equation. Let me write that out.\n\nSo, x = (m/100) * 4y. Because when something is a certain percentage of another, you multiply that percentage (as a decimal) by the other thing. So yeah, that makes sense.\n\nWait, I can simplify that equation.

Let me check the steps again.\n\nWait, the expression is (25 / y) * 100%? Wait, no. Wait, the formula was (m/x)*100. So, if m/x is 25/y, then m is (25/y) times 100% of x. So, that would be (25/y) * 100% = 2500/y %.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because when I write (m/x)*100%, that's m as a percentage of x. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in substitution.\n\nOriginal equation: x = (m/100) *4y \u2192 x = (4 m y)/100.\n\nThen, m / x = m / ( (4 m y)/100 ) \u2192 m * 100/(4 m y) \u2192 100/(4 y) \u2192 25 / y. Because m cancels out.\n\nSo, m/x is 25/y.

So the answer is 2500/y percent. So, the option D is 2500/y, which would be the correct percentage.\n\nWait, but wait another second. Let me think about whether I set up the problem correctly. Because sometimes, when dealing with percentages, it's easy to mix up which is the part and which is the whole.\n\nThe problem states that x is m percent of 4y. So, x = (m/100) *4y \u2192 x = (4 m y)/100.\n\nThen, the question is, m is what percentage of x. So, m is the part, and x is the whole. So, the percentage would be (m / x) * 100%.\n\nYes, that's correct. So substituting x, as I did before, gives 2500/y %.\n\nSo the correct answer is D: 2500/y.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nThe question says: If m is greater than 0, y is greater than 0, and x is m percent of 4y, then in terms of y, m is what percentage of x?\n\nHmm, let me break this down. So, x is m percent of 4y. I think that translates to an equation. Let me write that out.\n\nSo, x = (m/100) * 4y. Because when something is a certain percentage of another, you multiply that percentage (as a decimal) by the other thing. So yeah, that makes sense.\n\nWait, I can simplify that equation. Let me compute the right side. 4y multiplied by m/100. So, x = (4y * m)/100. Alternatively, x = (4 m y) / 100.\n\nBut the question is asking, m is what percentage of x. So, I think that means we're looking for m as a percentage of x. Which would be (m / x) * 100%. Because to find the percentage, you take the part over the whole and multiply by 100.\n\nSo, I need to express m as a percentage of x. Let me write that formula:\n\nPercentage = (m / x) * 100%\n\nI already have x in terms of m and y. So I can substitute x from earlier.\n\nSo, x = (4 m y) / 100. Let me plug that into the denominator.\n\nSo, m / x = m / [(4 m y)/100] \n\nWait, when I divide by a fraction, it's the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So,\n\nm / [(4 m y)/100] = m * (100)/(4 m y)\n\nSimplify that. The m in the numerator and denominator will cancel out. So,\n\n(100)/(4 y) = 25 / y. Because 100 divided by 4 is 25.\n\nSo, m divided by x is 25 divided by y. Then, the percentage is that multiplied by 100%, so:\n\nPercentage = (25 / y) * 100%\n\nWait, let me compute that. 25 times 100 is 2500, so 2500 / y percent.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right.

So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. x is m% of 4y: x = (m/100) *4y = (4m y)/100.\n\n2. m as a percentage of x: (m / x) * 100 = (m / (4m y/100)) * 100.\n\nWait, wait a second. Wait, I think I miscalculated earlier. Let me go through that again.\n\nIn step 2, x is (4m y)/100. So when I compute m/x, it's m divided by (4m y /100). Let's compute that.\n\nm divided by (4m y /100) is equal to m * (100)/(4m y). The m's cancel out, so it's (100)/(4y) = 25/y. Then multiply by 100% as it's a percentage. So 25/y * 100 is 2500/y percent. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo yes, the answer should be D) 2500/y.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by translating the given information into mathematical expressions. The problem states that \\( x \\) is \\( m \\)% of \\( 4y \\), which can be written as:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{m}{100} \\cdot 4y = \\frac{4my}{100}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine what percentage \\( m \\) is of \\( x \\). This is expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{m}{x} \\right) \\cdot 100\\%.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( x = \\frac{4my}{100} \\) into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{m}{\\frac{4my}{100}} \\right) \\cdot 100\\%.\n\\]\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{m}{\\frac{4my}{100}} = m \\cdot \\frac{100}{4my} = \\frac{100}{4y} = \\frac{25}{y}.\n\\]\n\nNow multiply by 100%:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\frac{25}{y} \\cdot 100\\% = \\frac{2500}{y}\\%.\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( m \\) is \\( \\frac{2500}{y}\\% \\) of \\( x \\). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:\n\n**D) \\( \\frac{2500}{y} \\)**.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem. Let's read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe question says: If m is greater than 0, y is greater than 0, and x is m percent of 4y, then, in terms of y, m is what percentage of x? The options are A to E.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me break this down. First, I need to translate the words into mathematical expressions.\n\nThe problem states that x is m percent of 4y. So, what's that in math terms? Well, when something is a certain percentage of another, you can write it as (percentage)/100 times the other. So, m percent would be m/100.\n\nSo x equals (m/100) multiplied by 4y. Let me write that down:\n\nx = (m/100) * 4y.\n\nWait, simplifying that, 4y times m over 100. So, x = (4m y)/100. Alternatively, x = (m * 4y)/100.\n\nBut I need to find m as a percentage of x. So, in other words, what is m in terms of x and y, and then express m as a percentage of x.\n\nWait, the question is asking, \"m is what percentage of x.\" So, that would be (m / x) * 100%, right? Because to find what percentage A is of B, you do (A/B)*100%.\n\nSo, I need to find (m/x)*100.\n\nBut I have x expressed in terms of m and y. So let me rearrange the equation to solve for m in terms of x and y.\n\nStarting from x = (4m y)/100.\n\nI can solve for m:\n\nMultiply both sides by 100:\n\n100x = 4m y.\n\nThen, divide both sides by 4y:\n\nm = (100x)/(4y).\n\nSimplify that: 100 divided by 4 is 25, so m = (25 x)/y.\n\nWait, no, wait, wait. Let me check that calculation. 100 divided by 4 is 25, so 100x/(4y) is 25x/y.\n\nSo m = (25x)/y.\n\nBut I need m as a percentage of x. So, (m / x) * 100%.\n\nSubstituting m from the above equation:\n\n(m / x) = (25x/y) / x.\n\nThe x's cancel out: 25x/(y) divided by x is 25/(y) * (x/x) \u2192 25/(y) * 1 = 25/y.\n\nSo (m/x) is 25/y.\n\nMultiply by 100% to get the percentage: (25/y) * 100% = (2500)/y %.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up the steps.\n\nWait, m is 25x/y. So m = 25x/y.\n\nSo when we compute m as a percentage of x, it's (m /x ) * 100.\n\nSubstituting m:\n\n( (25x/y) / x ) * 100.\n\nThe x's cancel, so 25/(y) * 100 = 2500/y.\n\nSo, m is (2500/y) percent of x.

So x = (m/100) * 4y \u2192 x = (4m y)/100.\n\n2. Solve for m: m = (100 x)/(4y) \u2192 m = 25 x / y.\n\n3. Now, m is what percentage of x? So (m / x) * 100%.\n\n4. Substitute m: (25x/y) / x * 100 \u2192 25x/(y x) * 100 \u2192 25/(y) *100 \u2192 2500/y %.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer is D.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: Maybe I can express m in terms of x and y, then find the percentage.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about it with numbers to test.\n\nSuppose y = 100, m = 25. Then 4y is 400. x is 25% of 400, which is 100. So x=100.\n\nNow, m is 25. What is 25 as a percentage of x (which is 100)? 25/100 *100% =25%.\n\nBut according to our formula, 2500/y. y is 100, so 2500/100 =25. Which matches.\n\nAnother test: y=2, m=50.\n\nx is m% of 4y \u2192 4y=8. 50% of 8 is 4. So x=4.\n\nWhat's m (50) as a percentage of x (4)?\n\n50/4 *100% =1250%.\n\nAccording to our formula, 2500/y \u2192 y=2 \u21922500/2=1250. Correct again.\n\nAnother example: y=5, m=25.\n\n4y=20, m% is 25%, so x=5.\n\nm as % of x: 25/5 *100 =500%.\n\nFormula: 2500/5 =500. Correct.\n\nSo the formula seems to hold. So the answer is D.\n",
