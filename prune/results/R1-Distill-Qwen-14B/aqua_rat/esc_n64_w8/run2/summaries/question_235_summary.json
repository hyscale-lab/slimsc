      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a sale and discounts. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that there was a 20% discount on all articles, and Vinit bought one for Rs.4578. They're asking what the actual selling price was. Wait, wait, wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh right, wait\u2014no, wait, the discount is on the original price, right? Because when you see a discount, it's usually the original price that's reduced.\n\nSo, if the article was sold at a 20% discount, that means Vinit paid 80% of the original price. Because 100% minus 20% discount is 80%. So the selling price after discount is 80% of the original price. Oh wait, but the problem says he purchased it for Rs.4578 during the sale. So that Rs.4578 is the discounted price, right? So that's 80% of the original.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, no, the question is a bit tricky. Let me read it again. It says, \"the actual selling price.\" Wait, no, the way it's phrased: the discount is available on all articles. Vinit bought it for 4578. So the 4578 is the price after discount. So we need to find the original selling price before the discount, which is the actual price without discount. Or wait, no, wait. Oh no, wait a second. Wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.\n\nWait, the problem says a discount of 20% was available. So the selling price after discount is 4578. So that's 80% of the original price. So the original price is higher than 4578. So to find the original price, we can calculate it as 4578 divided by 0.8.\n\nLet me do that calculation. 4578 divided by 0.8. Let me think, 4578 \u00f7 0.8. Hmm, 0.8 is the same as 4/5. So dividing by 4/5 is the same as multiplying by 5/4. So 4578 * (5/4). Let me compute that.\n\n4578 multiplied by 5 is 22890. Then divided by 4. Let's see, 22890 \u00f74. 4 goes into 22 five times (20), remainder 2. Bring down the 8: 28, 4 goes 7 times (28), remainder 0. Next digit is 9: 9 \u00f74 is 2 with remainder 1. Then 0: bring down the 0, 10 divided by 4 is 2 with remainder 2. So the result is 5722.5? Wait, wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, 4578 * 5 = 22890. Divided by 4: 22890 /4. Let's see, 4 into 22 is 5, 5*4=20, remainder 2. Bring down 8: 28. 4 into 28 is 7, 7*4=28. Next, bring down 9: 9 divided by 4 is 2, 2*4=8, remainder 1. Bring down 0: 10. 4 into 10 is 2, 2*4=8, remainder 2. So the division gives 5722 with a remainder of 2, so 5722.5. Wait, but 4578 *5 is 22890, right? 22890 divided by 4 is 5722.5.\n\nBut looking at the options, the choices are all integers. Let me see the options: A)5050, B)5723, C)5040, D)4950, E)4870.\n\nWait, 5722.5 isn't an option. Hmm. But the options have 5723, which is very close. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check the math. Let me calculate 4578 \u00f7 0.8 again. Alternatively, 4578 * 1.25 (since 1/0.8 is 1.25). 4578 *1.25. Let's compute that.\n\n1.25 is the same as 5/4, so 4578 multiplied by 5 is 22890, divided by 4 is 5722.5. Yeah, same as before.\n\nSo that would round to 5722.5, but the options don't have that. The closest is option B)5723. So perhaps that's the intended answer. Or maybe I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me recheck the multiplication. 4578 * 5 is 22890. Divided by 4: 22890 \u00f74. Let me do this step by step.\n\n22890 divided by 4:\n\n4 into 2 is 0, but wait, 4 into 22 is 5 (5*4=20), remainder 2. Bring down the 8: 28. 4 into 28 is 7. So now we have 572. Bring down the 9: 4 into 9 is 2, remainder 1. Bring down the 0: 10. 4 into 10 is 2, remainder 2. So the result is 5722.5. So 5722.5 is correct.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So perhaps I've misunderstood the question. Maybe the Rs.4578 is the original price, and the discount is 20%, making the selling price lower. But that would make the problem more straightforward.\n\nWait, the question says Vinit purchased the article for 4578 in the sale. So the sale price is 4578. So the original price was higher. So my initial approach is correct. So the actual selling price before discount is 5722.5. But that's not an option.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me think: the selling price after discount is 4578. The discount is 20%, so the selling price is 80% of the original. So original price = 4578 / 0.8.\n\nLet me compute 4578 / 0.8.\n\n0.8 is 4/5, so 4578 *5/4.\n\n4578 *5 = 22890. Divided by 4 is 5722.5.\n\nHmm, same result.\n\nWait, maybe the question is phrased differently. What if the actual selling price is the original price, and the discounted price is 4578. Then the actual selling price would be higher. So the answer is 5722.5, but that's not an option. So maybe I need to check if any of the options, when reduced by 20%, gives 4578.\n\nWait, let's try that. Let's see each option and subtract 20% to see if any of them gives 4578.\n\nOption A:5050. 20% of 5050 is 1010. 5050 -1010=4040. Not 4578.\n\nOption B:5723. 20% is 1144.6. 5723-1144.6=4578.4. Hmm, which is close to 4578, but not exactly. Wait, but maybe due to rounding, it's considered correct.\n\nOption C:5040. 20% is 1008. 5040-1008=4032. Not 4578.\n\nOption D:4950. 20% is 990. 4950-990=3960. No.\n\nOption E:4870. 20% is 974. 4870-974=3896. No.\n\nWait, so option B when reduced by 20% gives 4578.4, which is very close to 4578. So perhaps that's the intended correct answer. So the actual selling price before discount was 5723, which when 20% is taken off, becomes approximately 4578.4, which is about 4578.\n\nBut wait, 5723 * 0.8 is 4578.4, which is 4578.4, but the question says Vinit bought it for 4578. So perhaps the correct option is B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if 5723 is the correct original price. Because 5723 * 0.8 is 4578.4, which is 4578.4. But the price he paid is 4578. So maybe the options are considering that, or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased the other way. Wait, maybe the actual selling price is what the customer paid, and the original selling price was higher. Hmm, no, the problem says Vinit bought it for 4578 in the sale, so that's the discounted price. So the actual (original) selling price is higher.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are in round numbers. Let's compute 4578 /0.8 exactly.\n\n4578 divided by 0.8:\n\nWell, 0.8 is 4/5, so 4578 *5 = 22890. Divide by 4: 22890 \u00f74 = 5722.5. So yes, exactly 5722.5. But that's not an option. So perhaps the options have a typo, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, the question says \"actual selling price\". Oh! Wait a second. Wait, wait. No, no, no. Wait, perhaps the actual selling price is the price before the discount, which would be higher. So, the selling price after discount is 4578, and the actual (original) selling price is 5722.5. But none of the options match that.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is the other way around. Maybe the actual selling price is the discounted price, and the question is asking for the original price. But no, that's not making sense.\n\nWait, maybe the question is phrased as the article was sold for 4578 after a 20% discount. So the original price was 4578 divided by 0.8, which is 5722.5. But the options don't have this. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if 4578 is the original price, and the selling price is after 20% discount. But that would make the selling price lower than 4578, but the problem states that Vinit purchased it for 4578 in the sale. So that would imply that 4578 is the discounted price.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem is: discount of 20% available on all articles. Vinit bought an article for Rs.4578. What was the actual selling price of the article?\n\nWait, the actual selling price\u2014so the price before discount. So the original price.\n\nWait, but perhaps the wording is confusing. \"Actual selling price\" could mean the price after discount, but that's not making sense because that's what Vinit paid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Let me think: if the discount is 20%, then the selling price is 80% of the original. So the original price is 100%, and the selling price is 80% of that.\n\nSo if the selling price (after discount) is 4578, the original price is 4578 /0.8 = 5722.5. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem is that the options are given in whole numbers, and the correct answer is 5722.5, which is approximately 5723, which is option B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 4578 /0.8 again.\n\n4578 divided by 0.8: \n\n0.8 is 4/5. So 4578 multiplied by 5 is 22890. Divided by 4, that's 5722.5.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the options must have a typo, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the discount is on the selling price, not the original. But that doesn't make much sense because discounts are usually on the original price.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is phrased as the discount is 20% on the selling price. But that's not standard, but let's try. So if the discount is 20% of the selling price, then the selling price would be the original price minus 20% of the original price. Wait, no, that's the same as before. Alternatively, if the discount is 20% of the selling price, then the selling price would be original price minus 20% of the selling price. Wait, but that's a bit different.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the discount is 20% on the original price, so the selling price is 80% of the original. So the original is higher. So the calculation holds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the actual selling price is the original price, and the discount is 20% of that. But that would make the price Vinit paid 80% of the original, which is the same as before.\n\nHmm. I think I've got to go with the calculation I did. The original price is 5722.5, but since that's not an option, the closest is B)5723. So I'll choose option B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves calculating the original selling price of an article before a 20% discount, given that Vinit purchased it for Rs. 4578 during the sale. Since the discount is 20%, the selling price after the discount is 80% of the original price. Therefore, the original price can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Original Price} = \\frac{\\text{Selling Price After Discount}}{0.8} = \\frac{4578}{0.8} = 5722.5\n\\]\n\nThis calculation shows that the original price is Rs. 5722.5. However, the options provided are all integers. Among the given options, the closest value to 5722.5 is **5723**, which corresponds to option B. To confirm, 20% of 5723 is 1144.6, and subtracting this from 5723 gives:\n\n\\[\n5723 - 1144.6 = 4578.4\n\\]\n\nThis is very close to the given selling price of Rs. 4578, suggesting that option B is the intended answer.

None of the other options, when reduced by 20%, result in Rs. 4578. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: B**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a discount sale. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that there was a 20% discount on all articles, and Vinit bought an article for Rs.4578. I need to find the actual selling price before the discount, right?\n\nWait, wait. Wait a minute. Wait, no, wait. Because when a discount is applied, the selling price is lower than the original price. So if Vinit bought it for Rs.4578 after a 20% discount, that means Rs.4578 is the price after the discount. So the original price must be higher than that, right? Because 20% off would reduce the original price to 80% of it.\n\nLet me think. So if the discount is 20%, the customer pays 80% of the original price. So the selling price after discount is 80% of the original. So to find the original price, I can use the formula: selling price = original price * (1 - discount rate). So rearranged, original price = selling price / (1 - discount rate).\n\nIn this case, the discount rate is 20%, which is 0.20 in decimal. So 1 - 0.20 is 0.80. So the original price would be Rs.4578 divided by 0.80.\n\nLet me calculate that. 4578 divided by 0.8. Hmm, 4578 / 0.8. Let me think in terms of fractions. 0.8 is the same as 4/5. So dividing by 4/5 is the same as multiplying by 5/4. So 4578 * (5/4) = ?\n\nWait, 4578 multiplied by 5 is 22890. Then divide by 4. Let me do that. 22890 divided by 4 is 5722.5. Oh, wait, but the options are all whole numbers. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate 4578 divided by 0.8 directly. Let's see. 0.8 goes into 4578 how many times? Let's do it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as 4578 * 10 / 8, since 0.8 is 8/10. So 4578 *10 =45780. Then divide by 8. 45780 /8. Let's compute that.\n\n8 \u00d7 5000 is 40,000. 45780 -40,000 = 5780. 8 \u00d7700 is 5600. 5780-5600=180. 8\u00d722=176. 180-176=4. So 5000+700+22=5722, with a remainder of 4. So 5722.5. So that's 5722.5, which is Rs.5722.50.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is 5723, which is close. But wait, none of the other options are near that. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are:\nA) 5050\nB) 5723\nC) 5040\nD) 4950\nE) 4870\n\nSo option B is 5723, which is about what I got (5722.5). But wait, why is the actual selling price the original price? No, wait. Wait, the question is phrased as \"What was the actual selling price of the article?\" Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the article was sold at a discount, so the actual selling price is the price after discount. Wait, but the question says, Vinit purchased it for Rs.4578. So that's the price after discount. So what is the original price?\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. The question says, \"What was the actual selling price of the article?\" But the actual selling price would be what the seller received, which is the discounted price. Or maybe I'm getting confused between the terms. Wait, in sales, the \"selling price\" is the price after discount, right? So the original price is the marked price, and the selling price is the discounted price.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me re-read the question. \"In a sale, a discount of 20% was available on all the articles. If Vinit purchased an article for Rs.4578 in the sale. What was the actual selling price of the article?\"\n\nWait, that's confusing. Because if the article was purchased for 4578, that's the price after the discount. So the actual selling price is 4578. But why would the question ask that? Or perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, and they're asking for the original price.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the question. Let me read it again. The question says, \"What was the actual selling price of the article?\" So perhaps the actual selling price is the price after discount. So that would be 4578. But looking at the options, 4578 isn't one of them. Wait, the options are A)5050, B)5723, C)5040, D)4950, E)4870. So 4578 isn't an option. That suggests I might have misunderstood the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the original price, not the selling price. Because if the article was sold at a 20% discount, and Vinit bought it for 4578, the original price would be higher. So perhaps the question is actually asking for the original price, but the wording is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is correct, and I'm miscalculating. Let me think again. The selling price is 4578, which is after 20% discount. So the original price would be 4578 divided by 0.8, which is 5722.5. Which is close to option B, 5723. But 5723 is not exactly 5722.5, but perhaps it's rounded.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the marked price, which is the original price before discount, which is what I calculated as 5722.5. So that would be option B.\n\nWait, but the question says \"What was the actual selling price of the article?\" So if the selling price is 4578, why is that not the answer? Because the options don't have 4578, so perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly and they meant to ask for the original price.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is correct, and I'm making a mistake in my calculation. Let me recalculate 4578 divided by 0.8.\n\n4578 \u00f7 0.8. Let me compute this using another approach. 0.8 is the same as 4/5. So 4578 divided by 4/5 is 4578 multiplied by 5/4. So 4578 \u00d75=22890. 22890 \u00f74=5722.5. So that's correct.\n\nBut the options are A)5050, B)5723, C)5040, D)4950, E)4870.\n\nSo 5722.5 is approximately 5723, which is option B. So the correct answer would be B.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the actual selling price, which I thought was 4578. But 4578 isn't an option, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly. Because if it's the actual selling price, it's 4578, but that's not an option. So perhaps the question intended to ask for the original price, which is 5722.5, so option B is the closest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me think again. Another possibility: maybe the discount is 20%, so the customer pays 80% of the original price. So original price \u00d7 0.8 = 4578. So original price is 4578 / 0.8 = 5722.5. So the original price is 5722.5, which is approximately 5723, option B.\n\nBut the question says, \"What was the actual selling price of the article?\" So the actual selling price is the price after discount, which is 4578. But that's not an option. So perhaps the question is wrong, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the terminology.\n\nWait, perhaps the term \"actual selling price\" refers to the original price, but that doesn't make sense. Normally, the selling price is the discounted price. So perhaps the question is incorrect, and it's actually asking for the original price, which is 5722.5, option B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me check the options again. The only one close to my calculation is B)5723. So perhaps the correct answer is B.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. If the article was sold for Rs.4578 after a 20% discount, the original price is 4578 /0.8=5722.5, which is option B. So the original price is 5723 when rounded to the nearest rupee.\n\nSo the correct answer is B.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a discount sale. Let me read it again. The question says that there's a 20% discount on all articles, and Vinit bought an article for Rs.4578 during the sale. They're asking what the actual selling price was before the discount. Hmm, wait, no, wait. Wait, no, actually, no, I think I got that wrong. Let me think. Oh, wait, no, the problem says Vinit purchased it for Rs.4578 in the sale. So that's the price after the discount. So the actual selling price before the discount would be higher, right? Because the discount was 20%.\n\nSo, I need to find the original price before the 20% discount. Because when you have a discount, the selling price is the original price minus the discount. So the selling price (SP) is after the discount. So the formula would be SP = Original Price (OP) - (Discount % * OP). Or, SP = OP * (1 - discount rate).\n\nBut wait, in this problem, the discount is 20%, so the selling price is 80% of the original price. Because 100% minus 20% is 80%. So, SP = OP * 0.8.\n\nBut the problem gives me the SP as Rs.4578. So I need to find OP. So OP = SP / 0.8.\n\nWait, let me do the math. 4578 divided by 0.8. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 4578 divided by 0.8. Well, 4578 * 10 is 45780, divided by 8 would be 5722.5. Wait, 4578 * 10 is 45780, divided by 8: 8 into 45780. Let me do that.\n\n8 * 5000 is 40,000. Subtract, 45780 - 40000 is 5780. 8 * 700 is 5600, so that's 5700. 5780-5600 is 180. 8*22 is 176. So that's 22.5. So total is 5000 + 700 + 22.5 = 5722.5. So OP is 5722.5.

The question says, \"What was the actual selling price of the article?\" Wait, no, wait. Wait, the way it's phrased is confusing me. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Vinit purchased an article for Rs.4578 in the sale. What was the actual selling price of the article?\"\n\nWait, wait a second. Oh, maybe I got it backward. Because in the sale, the price Vinit paid was Rs.4578, which is after the discount. So the actual selling price is the price after discount, but that's what he paid. So perhaps the actual selling price is the same as the price he paid. But that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the question is phrased differently.\n\nWait, maybe the wording is confusing me. Let me think again. The discount is 20% on all articles. So the article was sold at a 20% discount. So the selling price (the price Vinit paid) is 80% of the original price. So the original price is higher. But the question is asking for the actual selling price, which is the discounted price. Oh wait, no, that's what Vinit paid. So perhaps the question is phrased differently. Wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong.\n\nWait, no, the question says, \"What was the actual selling price of the article?\" So the actual selling price is the price before the discount? No, that doesn't make sense. Because the actual selling price would be the price after the discount, right? Because that's what was actually paid. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the original price is the actual selling price, and the discounted price is the amount Vinit paid. But that's not how it's usually phrased. Let me think. Oh wait, perhaps the question is asking for the original price, not the selling price. Because the selling price is the discounted price, which is Rs.4578. So if the question is asking for the original price, then OP is 4578 / 0.8 = 5722.5, which is approximately 5723, option B.\n\nBut the options are A)5050, B)5723, C)5040, D)4950, E)4870.\n\nSo the correct answer would be B. But wait, let me double-check my calculations. 4578 divided by 0.8.\n\nLet me compute 4578 / 0.8:\n\nAnother way: 4578 * 5/4. Because 0.8 is 4/5, so dividing by 4/5 is same as multiplying by 5/4.\n\nSo 4578 * 5 = 22890, then divided by 4: 22890 /4 = 5722.5. Yep, same as before.

The question says that there's a 20% discount on all articles, and Vinit bought an article for Rs.4578 during the sale. They're asking what the actual selling price was before the discount. Hmm, wait, no, wait. Wait, no, actually, no, I think I got that wrong. Let me think. Oh, wait, no, the problem says Vinit purchased it for Rs.4578 in the sale. So that's the price after the discount. So the actual selling price before the discount would be higher, right? Because the discount was 20%.\n\nSo, I need to find the original price before the 20% discount. Because when you have a discount, the selling price is the original price minus the discount. So the selling price (SP) is after the discount. So the formula would be SP = Original Price (OP) - (Discount % * OP). Or, SP = OP * (1 - discount rate).\n\nBut wait, in this problem, the discount is 20%, so the selling price is 80% of the original price. Because 100% minus 20% is 80%. So, SP = OP * 0.8.\n\nBut the problem gives me the SP as Rs.4578. So I need to find OP. So OP = SP / 0.8.\n\nWait, let me do the math. 4578 divided by 0.8. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 4578 divided by 0.8. Well, 4578 * 10 is 45780, divided by 8 would be 5722.5. Wait, 4578 * 10 is 45780, divided by 8: 8 into 45780. Let me do that.\n\n8 * 5000 is 40,000. Subtract, 45780 - 40000 is 5780. 8 * 700 is 5600, so that's 5700. 5780-5600 is 180. 8*22 is 176. So that's 22.5. So total is 5000 + 700 + 22.5 = 5722.5. So OP is 5722.5. But looking at the options, the choices are A) 5050, B)5723, C)5040, D)4950, E)4870.\n\nWait, 5722.5 is approximately 5723, which is option B. But wait, the options have 5040 as option C. Hmm, did I make a mistake in the calculation?\n\nWait, maybe I got the question wrong. Let me read the question again. Oh wait, wait. The question says, \"What was the actual selling price of the article?\" Wait, no, wait. Wait, the way it's phrased is confusing me. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Vinit purchased an article for Rs.4578 in the sale. What was the actual selling price of the article?\"\n\nWait, wait a second. Oh, maybe I got it backward. Because in the sale, the price Vinit paid was Rs.4578, which is after the discount. So the actual selling price is the price after discount, but that's what he paid. So perhaps the actual selling price is the same as the price he paid. But that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the question is phrased differently.\n\nWait, maybe the wording is confusing me. Let me think again. The discount is 20% on all articles. So the article was sold at a 20% discount. So the selling price (the price Vinit paid) is 80% of the original price. So the original price is higher. But the question is asking for the actual selling price, which is the discounted price. Oh wait, no, that's what Vinit paid. So perhaps the question is phrased differently. Wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong.\n\nWait, no, the question says, \"What was the actual selling price of the article?\" So the actual selling price is the price before the discount? No, that doesn't make sense. Because the actual selling price would be the price after the discount, right? Because that's what was actually paid. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the original price is the actual selling price, and the discounted price is the amount Vinit paid. But that's not how it's usually phrased. Let me think. Oh wait, perhaps the question is asking for the original price, not the selling price. Because the selling price is the discounted price, which is Rs.4578. So if the question is asking for the original price, then OP is 4578 / 0.8 = 5722.5, which is approximately 5723, option B.\n\nBut the options are A)5050, B)5723, C)5040, D)4950, E)4870.\n\nSo the correct answer would be B. But wait, let me double-check my calculations. 4578 divided by 0.8.\n\nLet me compute 4578 / 0.8:\n\nAnother way: 4578 * 5/4. Because 0.8 is 4/5, so dividing by 4/5 is same as multiplying by 5/4.\n\nSo 4578 * 5 = 22890, then divided by 4: 22890 /4 = 5722.5. Yep, same as before. So 5722.5, which is 5723 when rounded to the nearest whole number.\n\nSo the correct option is B)5723.\n\n\nTo determine the original price of the article before the 20% discount, we use the relationship between the selling price (SP) and the original price (OP). The selling price after a 20% discount is 80% of the original price, so:\n\n\\[\n\\text{SP} = \\text{OP} \\times 0.8\n\\]\n\nRearranging to solve for OP:\n\n\\[\n\\text{OP} = \\frac{\\text{SP}}{0.8}\n\\]\n\nGiven that the selling price (SP) is Rs. 4578, we substitute this value:\n\n\\[\n\\text{OP} = \\frac{4578}{0.8} = 5722.5\n\\]\n\nSince the options are in whole numbers, we approximate 5722.5 to 5723. Comparing this with the provided options, the correct answer is:\n\n**A) 5050**  \n**B) 5723**  \n**C) 5040**  \n**D) 4950**  \n**E) 4870**\n\nThe closest match is **B) 5723**.\n\nAnswer: B",

Because if the article was on sale, the selling price Vinit paid is the discounted price. So the actual selling price, perhaps, is the original price before discount. Or maybe I'm getting it mixed up.\n\nWait, maybe the term \"actual selling price\" refers to the price after the discount. But that's confusing because the sale price is the discounted price. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think again.\n\nSo, the problem says the discount is 20% on all articles. Vinit bought an article for Rs.4578 in the sale. So that Rs.4578 is the price after a 20% discount. So the original price, which is the actual selling price before the discount, is what we need to find.\n\nRight, so the formula for the selling price after discount is: Selling Price = Original Price \u00d7 (1 - Discount%). So here, the selling price is 4578, which is 80% of the original price because the discount is 20%. So we can set up the equation: 4578 = Original Price \u00d7 0.8.\n\nTo find the Original Price, we rearrange the equation: Original Price = 4578 / 0.8. Let me calculate that.\n\n4578 divided by 0.8. Hmm, 0.8 is 4/5, so dividing by 0.8 is the same as multiplying by 5/4. So 4578 * 5 = 22890, then divided by 4. Let's do that.\n\n22890 divided by 4. Let's see: 4 \u00d7 5722 is 22888. So 22890 - 22888 is 2. So 22890 /4 = 5722.5. So the original price is 5722.5. But wait, none of the options are 5722.5.

So perhaps the actual calculation is a bit different.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.\n\nCalculating 4578 divided by 0.8. Let's do it step by step.\n\n4578 \u00f7 0.8:\n\nFirst, 0.8 is the same as 8/10, so dividing by 0.8 is the same as multiplying by 10/8, which is 5/4. So 4578 * 5 = ?\n\n4578 * 5: 4000*5=20000, 500*5=2500, 70*5=350, 8*5=40. So adding them up: 20000 + 2500 is 22500, plus 350 is 22850, plus 40 is 22890. So 4578 *5 =22890. Then divided by 4.\n\n22890 \u00f74. Let's do this division.\n\n4 into 22 is 5, 5\u00d74=20, remainder 2. Bring down 8: 28. 4 into 28 is 7, 7\u00d74=28, remainder 0. Bring down 9: 09. 4 into 9 is 2, 2\u00d74=8, remainder 1. Bring down 0: 10. 4 into 10 is 2, 2\u00d74=8, remainder 2. So it's 5722.5. So yeah, 5722.5, which is 5722.50, but in terms of rupees, that would be 5722.50, which is not a standard way to write it. Usually, it would be 5722.50, but perhaps the options round it to the nearest whole number. So 5722.5 is approximately 5723, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, another approach: perhaps the discount is on the original price, and the selling price is after the discount. So the calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is phrased in a way that the actual selling price is after the discount, but the problem says \"What was the actual selling price of the article?\" That's a bit confusing. If the article was sold at 4578, then that's the actual selling price. Wait, but that would make no sense because the options don't have 4578.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me read it again.\n\n\"In a sale, a discount of 20% was available on all the articles. If Vinit purchased an article for Rs.4578 in the sale. What was the actual selling price of the article?\"\n\nWait, perhaps the actual selling price refers to the price before the discount. Because the sale price is after the discount. So the actual selling price is the original, and the sale price is the discounted price.\n\nSo, in that case, the original price would be higher than 4578, and 4578 is 80% of that.\n\nSo the original price is 4578 / 0.8 = 5722.5, which is approximately 5723. So option B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Maybe the \"actual selling price\" is the price after the discount. But that would make the answer 4578, which isn't an option. So that can't be.\n\nSo I think the correct approach is that 4578 is the sale price, which is 80% of the original.

So the question says that there's a 20% discount on all articles, and Vinit bought something for Rs.4578. I need to find the actual selling price before the discount. Wait, no, wait. Wait, hold on. Wait, the way the question is phrased is a bit confusing. Let me read it again.\n\n\"In a sale, a discount of 20% was available on all the articles. If Vinit purchased an article for Rs.4578 in the sale. What was the actual selling price of the article?\"\n\nHmm. So the discount is 20%, meaning that the customer pays 80% of the original price, right? Because 100% minus 20% discount is 80% of the original price. So Vinit paid Rs.4578, which is after the discount. So the actual selling price before the discount, or the original price, is what we're looking for.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Wait, the way the question is phrased is a bit tricky. The discount is on all articles, so the customer pays 80% of the original price. So if the original price was X, then Vinit paid 0.8 * X = 4578. So we need to find X.\n\nSo the formula would be: X = 4578 / 0.8. Let me calculate that.\n\nWait, 4578 divided by 0.8. Hmm. Let me think. 4578 divided by 0.8 is the same as multiplying by 5/4, because 1/0.8 is 1.25, which is 5/4. So 4578 * 5/4. Let's compute that.\n\n4578 divided by 4 is 1144.5, right? Because 4*1144 is 4576, so 4578 is 4576 +2, so 1144.5. Then multiply by 5. 1144.5 *5. Let's do that.\n\n1144.5 *5: 1000*5=5000, 144*5=720, 0.5*5=2.5. So 5000 +720 is 5720, plus 2.5 is 5722.5. Wait, but 4578 *5 is 22890, divided by 4 is 5722.5. So the original price was Rs.5722.5, which is not one of the options. Wait, the options are A)5050, B)5723, C)5040, D)4950, E)4870.\n\nHmm, option B is 5723. So that's very close. So maybe the question is asking for the selling price after discount, but I'm a bit confused because the way the question is phrased. Wait, wait, let me read the question again.\n\nWait, the question says, \"What was the actual selling price of the article?\" Wait, wait. Oh, wait. Wait, no. Because in a sale, the price you pay is after the discount. So the actual selling price is the price before the discount. Or is the question asking for the price after discount? No, because Vinit bought it for 4578, which is the price after the discount. So the actual selling price is the original price, right? Because the selling price is the price the customer pays, which is after the discount. Wait, no, no. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"the discount of 20% was available on all the articles.\" So the selling price is the discounted price. So the actual selling price, before discount, is higher. So the correct approach is that Vinit paid 4578, which is after 20% discount. So the actual selling price is 4578 / 0.8, which is 5722.5, which rounds to 5723. So the correct answer would be option B, 5723.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Because sometimes, in some contexts, \"selling price\" refers to the price after discount. But in this case, the question is asking for the \"actual selling price\", which might refer to the original price. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question.\n\nWait, the question says, \"What was the actual selling price of the article?\" So the actual selling price before the discount? Or is the actual selling price the price after the discount, and the original price is the marked price? Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing terms. Let me clarify: When a discount is given, the marked price is the original price, and the selling price is the discounted price. So in this case, the selling price is 4578, which is after a 20% discount. So the actual selling price, perhaps the question is referring to the original price as the actual price. So the correct calculation is 4578 / 0.8 = 5722.5, which is option B: 5723.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is 5723, which is very close to 5722.5. So that's the correct answer. So the correct option is B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Maybe the actual selling price is the price before discount, but the problem is phrased a bit confusingly. Let me think again. So the question says, \"What was the actual selling price of the article?\" So perhaps the actual selling price is what the article was sold for, which is 4578. But that seems unlikely because the options don't have that.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it another way. The customer paid Rs.4578, which is after a 20% discount. So the original price was higher. So to find the original price, we calculate 4578 / 0.8. As I did before, which is 5722.5, so 5723 when rounded.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 5723, which would be the correct answer.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a discount during a sale. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So the question says that there's a 20% discount on all articles, and Vinit bought something for Rs.4578. I need to find the actual selling price before the discount. Wait, no, wait. Wait, hold on. Wait, the way the question is phrased is a bit confusing. Let me read it again.\n\n\"In a sale, a discount of 20% was available on all the articles. If Vinit purchased an article for Rs.4578 in the sale. What was the actual selling price of the article?\"\n\nHmm. So the discount is 20%, meaning that the customer pays 80% of the original price, right? Because 100% minus 20% discount is 80% of the original price. So Vinit paid Rs.4578, which is after the discount. So the actual selling price before the discount, or the original price, is what we're looking for.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Wait, the way the question is phrased is a bit tricky. The discount is on all articles, so the customer pays 80% of the original price. So if the original price was X, then Vinit paid 0.8 * X = 4578. So we need to find X.\n\nSo the formula would be: X = 4578 / 0.8. Let me calculate that.\n\nWait, 4578 divided by 0.8. Hmm. Let me think. 4578 divided by 0.8 is the same as multiplying by 5/4, because 1/0.8 is 1.25, which is 5/4. So 4578 * 5/4. Let's compute that.\n\n4578 divided by 4 is 1144.5, right? Because 4*1144 is 4576, so 4578 is 4576 +2, so 1144.5. Then multiply by 5. 1144.5 *5. Let's do that.\n\n1144.5 *5: 1000*5=5000, 144*5=720, 0.5*5=2.5. So 5000 +720 is 5720, plus 2.5 is 5722.5. Wait, but 4578 *5 is 22890, divided by 4 is 5722.5. So the original price was Rs.5722.5, which is not one of the options. Wait, the options are A)5050, B)5723, C)5040, D)4950, E)4870.\n\nHmm, option B is 5723. So that's very close. So maybe the question is asking for the selling price after discount, but I'm a bit confused because the way the question is phrased. Wait, wait, let me read the question again.\n\nWait, the question says, \"What was the actual selling price of the article?\" Wait, wait. Oh, wait. Wait, no. Because in a sale, the price you pay is after the discount. So the actual selling price is the price before the discount. Or is the question asking for the price after discount? No, because Vinit bought it for 4578, which is the price after the discount. So the actual selling price is the original price, right? Because the selling price is the price the customer pays, which is after the discount. Wait, no, no. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"the discount of 20% was available on all the articles.\" So the selling price is the discounted price. So the actual selling price, before discount, is higher. So the correct approach is that Vinit paid 4578, which is after 20% discount. So the actual selling price is 4578 / 0.8, which is 5722.5, which rounds to 5723. So the correct answer would be option B, 5723.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Because sometimes, in some contexts, \"selling price\" refers to the price after discount. But in this case, the question is asking for the \"actual selling price\", which might refer to the original price. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question.\n\nWait, the question says, \"What was the actual selling price of the article?\" So the actual selling price before the discount? Or is the actual selling price the price after the discount, and the original price is the marked price? Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing terms. Let me clarify: When a discount is given, the marked price is the original price, and the selling price is the discounted price. So in this case, the selling price is 4578, which is after a 20% discount. So the actual selling price, perhaps the question is referring to the original price as the actual price. So the correct calculation is 4578 / 0.8 = 5722.5, which is option B: 5723.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is 5723, which is very close to 5722.5. So that's the correct answer. So the correct option is B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Maybe the actual selling price is the price before discount, but the problem is phrased a bit confusingly. Let me think again. So the question says, \"What was the actual selling price of the article?\" So perhaps the actual selling price is what the article was sold for, which is 4578. But that seems unlikely because the options don't have that.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it another way. The customer paid Rs.4578, which is after a 20% discount. So the original price was higher. So to find the original price, we calculate 4578 / 0.8. As I did before, which is 5722.5, so 5723 when rounded.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 5723, which would be the correct answer.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by understanding that a 20% discount means the customer pays 80% of the original price. Vinit purchased the article for Rs. 4578 after the discount, so this amount represents 80% of the original price. To find the original price, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Original Price} = \\frac{\\text{Price after discount}}{0.8}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given price after discount:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Original Price} = \\frac{4578}{0.8}\n\\]\n\nPerforming the division:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Original Price} = 4578 \\times \\frac{5}{4} = 4578 \\times 1.25 = 5722.5\n\\]\n\nSince the options are in whole numbers, we round 5722.5 to the nearest whole number, which is 5723. Comparing this with the options, the correct answer is:\n\n**A) 5050**  \n**B) 5723**  \n**C) 5040**  \n**D) 4950**  \n**E) 4870**\n\nThe closest match is **B) 5723**.\n\nAnswer: B",

I need to find the actual selling price of the article. Wait, wait, that's a bit confusing. Wait, no, actually, wait. Because if there's a discount, the price Vinit paid is after the discount. So the Rs.4578 is the selling price after the 20% discount. So the actual selling price before the discount was higher. Hmm, no, wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the terms.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The problem says the discount is on all articles, so when Vinit bought it, he paid Rs.4578 which is after the discount. So the original selling price (without discount) must have been higher. Because a discount reduces the price.\n\nSo the question is, what was the actual selling price before the discount? Or is it the marked price? Hmm. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of what the discount means. A 20% discount means the customer pays 80% of the original price. Because 100% minus 20% discount is 80%.\n\nSo if the selling price after discount is Rs.4578, then that is 80% of the original price. So I can set up an equation where 80% of the original price equals 4578. Let me write that out.\n\nLet me denote the original selling price as SP. So, 80% of SP is 4578. So, 0.8 * SP = 4578. To find SP, I can divide 4578 by 0.8.\n\nLet me compute that. 4578 divided by 0.8. Alternatively, I can think of it as 4578 multiplied by 10/8, since 0.8 is 8/10, so dividing by 8/10 is multiplying by 10/8.\n\nWait, 10/8 is the same as 5/4, which is 1.25. So 4578 * 1.25.\n\nHmm, let me compute that. 4578 * 1.25. Let me break it down.\n\n4578 * 1 = 4578. 4578 * 0.25 is a quarter of that. So what's a quarter of 4578? 4578 divided by 4. Let me calculate that.\n\n4578 divided by 4: 4 into 45 is 11, remainder 1. 4 into 17 (after bringing down the 7) is 4, remainder 1. 4 into 18 (with the 8) is 4, with remainder 2. Wait, perhaps I should compute it more carefully.\n\nWait, 4 * 1000 is 4000. So 4578 is 4000 + 578. So 578 divided by 4 is 144.5. Because 4*144=576, so 578-576=2, so 0.5. So 578/4=144.5. So 4578/4 is 1144.5.\n\nSo 0.25 *4578 is 1144.5. So adding that to 4578 gives 4578 + 1144.5 = 5722.5.\n\nWait, but wait, wait. Wait, 4578 * 1.25 equals 5722.5? Let me check that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute it as 4578 * (5/4). 5/4 is 1.25. So 4578 * 5 = 22890, divided by 4. Let's see, 22890 divided by 4. 4 into 22 is 5, 5*4=20, remainder 2. 28 divided by 4 is 7, no remainder. 90 divided by 4 is 22 with 2 remainder. Wait, wait, perhaps I should do it step by step.\n\n22890 \u00f7 4:\n\n4 into 2 is 0, but 22 divided by 4 is 5, remainder 2.\n\n5*4=20, 22-20=2.\n\nBring down the 8: 28. 28 divided by 4 is 7, no remainder.\n\nBring down the 9: 9. 4 into 9 is 2, remainder 1.\n\nBring down the 0: 10. 4 into 10 is 2, remainder 2.\n\nWait, so 22890 /4 is 5722.5. Because 4 *5722 is 22888, and 22890 is 2 more, so 0.5.\n\nSo yes, 4578 *1.25 is 5722.5. So the original selling price before discount was Rs.5722.5.\n\nBut looking at the options, I see the options are:\n\nA) 5050\n\nB)5723\n\nC)5040\n\nD)4950\n\nE)4870\n\nHmm, 5722.5 is not exactly one of the options. But option B is 5723. That's very close. So perhaps the actual answer is option B.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a calculation mistake.\n\nWait, another approach: 20% discount on the original price, so the price Vinit paid is 80% of the original. So original price = 4578 / 0.8.\n\nLet me compute 4578 divided by 0.8.\n\n4578 \u00f7 0.8.\n\nAlternatively, 4578 * (10/8) = 4578 * (5/4) = same as before.\n\nSo 4578 *5 =22890. Divided by 4 is 5722.5.\n\nSo yes, the original price was 5722.5. Since the options don't have a decimal, option B is 5723, which is the closest. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but another thought: maybe the question is phrased differently. Wait, the question says, \"what was the actual selling price of the article?\" Wait, no, I'm confused again.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the question. The question states that Vinit purchased the article for Rs.4578 in the sale. The discount is 20%, so the Rs.4578 is after the discount. So the actual selling price before the discount would be the original price, which I calculated as 5722.5, which is option B (5723).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the marked price, but I think in this context, the original selling price is what's being asked.\n\nSo the correct answer is option B, 5723.\n",

So the actual selling price is what? Or is that the original price? Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, let me think.

Let's see, 4578 divided by 8 is 572.25, because 8 times 572 is 4576, so 572.25 times 8 is 4578. So 4578 \u00f7 0.8 is 5722.5. Wait, wait, wait.

Because the options are higher numbers, like 5050, 5723, etc. So the original price must be higher than 4578.\n\nSo the discount is 20%, which means the customer pays 80% of the original price. Because 100% minus 20% discount is 80%. So if the selling price (after discount) is 4578, that's 80% of the original price.\n\nSo to find the original price, I need to calculate 4578 divided by 0.8. Because 80% is 0.8 in decimal. Let me do that calculation.\n\n4578 divided by 0.8. Hmm, 4578 \u00f7 0.8. Let's see, 4578 divided by 8 is 572.25, because 8 times 572 is 4576, so 572.25 times 8 is 4578. So 4578 \u00f7 0.8 is 5722.5. Wait, wait, wait. Because 0.8 is 4/5, so dividing by 0.8 is the same as multiplying by 5/4. So 4578 multiplied by 5 is 22890, divided by 4 is 5722.5. So the original price was 5722.5. But the options don't have that exactly. Let me look at the options.\n\nOptions are A) 5050, B)5723, C)5040, D)4950, E)4870. So option B is 5723, which is very close to 5722.5. So the original price must be 5723.\n\nWait, but why is the selling price given as 4578? Because the discount is 20%, so 20% off the original. So 4578 is 80% of the original. So yeah, that makes sense.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't confuse anything. So the original price is higher, and after 20% discount, it's 4578. So the calculation is correct. So the answer should be option B, 5723.\n\n\nTo determine the original selling price of the article before the 20% discount, we know that the selling price after the discount is Rs. 4578. Since the discount is 20%, the selling price represents 80% of the original price. To find the original price, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Original Price} = \\frac{\\text{Selling Price}}{0.8} = \\frac{4578}{0.8} = 5722.5\n\\]\n\nAmong the given options, the closest value to 5722.5 is **5723**, which corresponds to option B. Therefore, the actual selling price of the article before the discount was Rs. 5723.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a discount during a sale, and I need to find the actual selling price of an article that Vinit bought. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nWait, the question says that there was a 20% discount on all articles, and Vinit bought something for Rs.4578. So I guess that's the price after the discount. Oh right, because the discount is applied to the original price, making the final price lower. So I need to find out what the original price was before the discount.\n\nSo, the formula I remember for discounts is: Selling Price = Original Price \u00d7 (100% - Discount%). Since the discount is 20%, the selling price is 80% of the original price. Oh right, because 100% minus 20% is 80%.\n\nSo, if I let the original price be X, then 80% of X equals Rs.4578. In math terms, that's 0.8 * X = 4578. To find X, I can rearrange this equation. X would be 4578 divided by 0.8.\n\nLet me calculate that. 4578 divided by 0.8. Hmm, 4578 \u00f7 0.8. Well, 0.8 is the same as 4/5, so dividing by 4/5 is the same as multiplying by 5/4. So 4578 * (5/4) equals... let me see. 4578 divided by 4 is 1144.5. Then multiplied by 5 is 5722.5. Wait, but the options are in whole numbers. Oh, wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, let me try another way. 4578 divided by 0.8. Let me compute that. 0.8 times what gives 4578? Let's think: 4578 / 0.8. Let me compute 4578 * 10 / 8, because 0.8 is 8/10. So 4578 * 10 is 45780, divided by 8. What's 45780 \u00f7 8?\n\nLet's calculate that. 8 into 45 is 5, 5*8=40, remainder 5. Bring down 7, making 57. 8 into 57 is 7 times, 7*8=56, remainder 1. Bring down 8, making 18. 8 into 18 is 2, 2*8=16, rem 2. Bring down 0, making 20. 8 into 20 is 2, 2*8=16, rem 4. Bring down the next 0, making 40. 8 into 40 is 5, exactly. So putting it all together: 5722.5. Oh, that's what I got earlier. So the original price would be Rs.5722.5.\n\nWait, but the options are A)5050, B)5723, C)5040, D)4950, E)4870. Hmm, option B is 5723, which is close to 5722.5. So probably that's the right answer.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake. Let me compute 5722.5 multiplied by 0.8. 5722.5 * 0.8 = ? Let's see, 5000 *0.8=4000. 722.5 *0.8 = 578. So 4000 +578=4578. Oh, right, that's correct. So the original price was 5722.5, which rounds to 5723 when considering whole rupees. But the options are in whole numbers, so the correct option must be B)5723.\n\nWait, but another thought: perhaps the problem considers the selling price as the amount Vinit paid, which is after the discount. So the original price was higher. So yes, the calculation seems right. So the answer is option B.\n",
