      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it says. Two numbers are in the ratio 3:5. If 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23. The question is asking for the smaller number. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, ratios can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that when two numbers are in a ratio, you can represent them as multiples of some common variable. So, if the ratio is 3:5, I can let the numbers be 3x and 5x, where x is some positive integer. That makes sense because 3x divided by 5x would simplify to 3/5, which is the given ratio.\n\nNow, the problem says that if 9 is subtracted from each of these numbers, the new ratio becomes 12:23. So, subtracting 9 from both 3x and 5x gives (3x -9) and (5x -9). The ratio of these two new numbers is 12:23. So, I can set up an equation based on that ratio.\n\nSo, the equation would be (3x -9)/(5x -9) = 12/23. To solve for x, I'll cross-multiply. That gives me 23*(3x -9) = 12*(5x -9). Let me compute both sides.\n\nOn the left side: 23 * 3x is 69x, and 23*(-9) is -207. So, left side is 69x -207.\n\nOn the right side: 12*5x is 60x, and 12*(-9) is -108. So, right side is 60x -108.\n\nNow, putting it all together: 69x -207 = 60x -108.\n\nI'll move all the x terms to one side and constants to the other. Subtract 60x from both sides: 69x -60x -207 = -108. That gives 9x -207 = -108.\n\nThen, add 207 to both sides: 9x = 99. So, x equals 99 divided by 9, which is 11. So x is 11.\n\nWait, let me double-check that math to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 9x = 99. Yes, 99 divided by 9 is 11. Correct.\n\nNow, the numbers were 3x and 5x. So, substituting x=11, the smaller number is 3x which is 3*11=33. The larger number is 5x=55.\n\nBut wait, the problem says if 9 is subtracted from each, the new ratio is 12:23. Let me verify that with x=11.\n\nSo, 3x -9 = 33 -9 =24, and 5x-9=55-9=46. Now, the ratio 24:46. Let's see if that simplifies to 12:23. Both 24 and 46 are divisible by 2, so dividing each by 2 gives 12/23. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the smaller number is 33, which is option B.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)21, B)33, C)35, D)42, E)58. So, 33 is option B.\n\nHmm, but let me think again. Did I make any mistakes in my steps? Let me go through it again.\n\nWe set the numbers as 3x and 5x. Subtract 9 each: (3x-9)/(5x-9) =12/23.\n\nCross multiply: 23*(3x-9) =12*(5x-9).\n\nCalculating left: 69x-207. Right:60x-108.\n\n69x -207 =60x-108.\n\nSubtract 60x:9x-207 =-108.\n\nAdd 207:9x=99. So x=11.\n\nSo numbers are 33 and 55. Subtract 9:24 and 46. 24/46 reduces to 12/23. Yep, correct.\n\nSo the answer should be B)33.\n",

So, right side is 60x -108.\n\nNow, putting it all together: 69x -207 = 60x -108.\n\nI'll move all the x terms to one side and constants to the other. Subtract 60x from both sides: 69x -60x -207 = -108. That gives 9x -207 = -108.\n\nThen, add 207 to both sides: 9x = 99. So, x equals 99 divided by 9, which is 11. So x is 11.\n\nWait, let me double-check that math to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 9x = 99. Yes, 99 divided by 9 is 11. Correct.\n\nNow, the numbers were 3x and 5x.

Then, if 9 is subtracted from each, the new ratio becomes 12:23. I need to find the smaller original number.\n\nAlright, first, I think I should represent the two numbers in terms of a variable. Since their ratio is 3:5, I can let the numbers be 3x and 5x, where x is a common multiplier. That makes sense because ratios are about the relative sizes, so scaling by x gives the actual numbers.\n\nSo the original numbers are 3x and 5x. Now, the problem says that when 9 is subtracted from each, the new ratio is 12:23. That means (3x - 9) divided by (5x - 9) equals 12/23.\n\nWait, I should set up the equation correctly. So, (3x - 9)/(5x - 9) = 12/23. To solve for x, I can cross-multiply. So 23*(3x -9) equals 12*(5x -9). Let me compute both sides.\n\nCalculating the left side: 23*3x is 69x, and 23*(-9) is -207. So left side is 69x -207.\n\nRight side: 12*5x is 60x, and 12*(-9) is -108. So right side is 60x -108.\n\nNow, the equation is 69x -207 = 60x -108. Let me get all x terms on one side and constants on the other. Subtract 60x from both sides: 9x -207 = -108.\n\nThen, add 207 to both sides: 9x = 99. Oh, wait, because 207 is 207, so -108 +207 is 99. So 9x =99. Then x=11.\n\nWait, wait, let me check that calculation. 69x minus 60x is 9x. On the left side, 69x-60x is 9x, right. Then, -207 equals -108 when I subtract 60x from both sides? Wait no, wait. Let me recheck the steps.\n\nWait, the equation after cross-multiplying was 69x -207 =60x -108.\n\nSubtract 60x from both sides: 9x -207 = -108.\n\nNow, add 207 to both sides: 9x = (-108) +207. Let's compute that. 207 minus 108 is 99, so 9x=99. Thus, x=11.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the original numbers are 3x and 5x. So 3x is 3*11=33, and 5x is 55. So the smaller number is 33.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 33. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check by plugging the numbers back into the problem. Original numbers: 33 and 55. Subtract 9 from each: 33-9=24, 55-9=46. What's the ratio of 24:46? Let's simplify. Both divide by 2: 12:23. Which matches the problem statement. So yes, correct.\n",

So 9x -207 = -108.\n\nThen add 207 to both sides: 9x = 99.\n\nDivide both sides by 9: x = 11.\n\nSo x is 11. Now, the original numbers were 3x and 5x. Let's compute them.\n\n3x = 3*11=33. 5x=5*11=55. So the two numbers are 33 and 55. The question asks for the smaller number, which is 33. Let me check the options: option B is 33. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me plug x=11 back into the new numbers.\n\n3x-9 = 33-9=24. 5x-9=55-9=46. Now, the ratio of 24:46. Let's simplify that. Both numbers are divisible by 2: 24/2=12, 46/2=23. So the ratio is 12:23, which matches the problem statement. So yes, x=11 is correct. So the smaller number is 33, which is option B.\n\n\nThe problem involves two numbers in the ratio 3:5. Let the numbers be \\(3x\\) and \\(5x\\). When 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are \\(3x - 9\\) and \\(5x - 9\\), and their ratio becomes \\(12:23\\). Setting up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3x - 9}{5x - 9} = \\frac{12}{23}.\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\n\\[\n23(3x - 9) = 12(5x - 9).\n\\]\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\n\\[\n69x - 207 = 60x - 108.\n\\]\n\nRearranging terms:\n\n\\[\n9x - 207 = -108.\n\\]\n\nAdding 207 to both sides:\n\n\\[\n9x = 99.\n\\]\n\nDividing by 9:\n\n\\[\nx = 11.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(x = 11\\) back into the original numbers:\n\n\\[\n3x = 3 \\times 11 = 33, \\quad 5x = 5 \\times 11 = 55.\n\\]\n\nThe smaller number is \\(33\\). Verifying, the new numbers after subtracting 9 are \\(24\\) and \\(46\\), which simplify to the ratio \\(12:23\\), confirming the solution is correct.\n\n**Answer: B**",

If 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23. The question is asking for the smaller number, and there are five options provided: A)21, B)33, C)35, D)42, E)58.\n\nHmm, I remember that ratios can be represented using variables. So, if two numbers are in the ratio 3:5, I can let the numbers be 3x and 5x, where x is a common multiplier. That makes sense because 3x divided by 5x gives 3/5, which is the given ratio.\n\nSo, the first number is 3x, and the second is 5x. Now, the problem says that if 9 is subtracted from each, the new ratio becomes 12:23. So, subtracting 9 from both, the new numbers are (3x - 9) and (5x - 9). The ratio of these two is 12:23.\n\nI can set up an equation based on this new ratio. So, (3x - 9)/(5x - 9) = 12/23. To solve for x, I can cross-multiply. That means 23*(3x -9) = 12*(5x -9).\n\nLet me compute each side. On the left side: 23*(3x) is 69x, and 23*(-9) is -207. So left side is 69x - 207.\n\nOn the right side: 12*(5x) is 60x, and 12*(-9) is -108. So right side is 60x - 108.\n\nNow, the equation becomes: 69x - 207 = 60x - 108.\n\nI need to get all the x terms on one side and constants on the other. Let me subtract 60x from both sides: 69x -60x -207 = -108. That simplifies to 9x -207 = -108.\n\nNext, I'll add 207 to both sides: 9x = -108 + 207. Let's compute that. 207 minus 108 is 99. So, 9x = 99.\n\nTo find x, I divide both sides by 9: x = 99/9. 99 divided by 9 is 11. So x is 11.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Now that I have x, I can find the original numbers. The smaller number was 3x, so 3*11 is 33. The larger number is 5x, which is 55.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense. Subtract 9 from each: 33-9=24, and 55-9=46. Now, the ratio of 24:46 should be 12:23. Let me simplify 24/46. Dividing numerator and denominator by 2 gives 12/23, which matches the given ratio. So that's correct.\n\nLooking back at the options, the smaller number is 33, which is option B. Let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. x is 11, 3x is 33. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAnother way to approach this might be to plug each option into the original problem to see which one works. Let me try option B, which is 33.\n\nIf the smaller number is 33, the larger must be in a 3:5 ratio, so 33*(5/3) = 55. Subtracting 9 gives 24 and 46. 24:46 reduces to 12:23, which is exactly what the problem states. So yes, that works.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check another option to see if it's a trap. Let's say option A is 21. Then the larger number would be 21*(5/3) = 35. Subtract 9: 12 and 26. 12/26 simplifies to 6/13, which is not 12/23. So A isn't correct.\n\nWhat about option C, 35? Then the larger number is 35*(5/3)= ~58.333. Wait, that can't be right because 35 is not a multiple of 3. Because in our setup, the numbers are 3x and 5x, so the smaller number must be a multiple of 3. 35 divided by 3 is not an integer, so 35 can't be the smaller number. So option C is invalid.\n\nSame logic applies to option D, 42. 42/3=14, so x would be 14. The larger number would be 70. Subtracting 9: 33 and 61. 33:61 is 33/61, which doesn't simplify to 12/23. So D is out.\n\nOption E is 58. 58 is not a multiple of 3 either. 58/3 is about 19.333. So it's not an integer, so it can't be part of the 3x and 5x setup. So E is also invalid.\n\nSo, only option B fits all the conditions. Therefore, the smaller number is 33.\n",

That should get rid of the fractions.\n\n23*(3x - 9) = 12*(5x - 9).\n\nLet me compute both sides:\n\nLeft side: 23*(3x) - 23*9 = 69x - 207.\n\nRight side: 12*(5x) - 12*9 = 60x - 108.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\n69x - 207 = 60x - 108.\n\nNow, I'll bring like terms together. Let me subtract 60x from both sides:\n\n69x -60x -207 = -108.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n9x -207 = -108.\n\nNext, I'll add 207 to both sides to isolate the term with x:\n\n9x = -108 + 207.\n\nCalculating the right side: 207 - 108 is 99, so 9x = 99.\n\nThen, divide both sides by 9:\n\nx = 99 /9 = 11.\n\nSo, x is 11. Now, I can find the original numbers.\n\nThe smaller number is 3x, which is 3*11=33. Wait, wait a minute, no, wait. Because 3x is the smaller number, right? Because 3:5, so 3x is the smaller one.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check. Because sometimes I get confused between which is which. So, the ratio is 3:5, meaning 3 parts to 5 parts. So, 3x is smaller than 5x. So yes, 3x is the smaller number.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, 33 is option B. So the answer should be B)33.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake in cross-multiplication or the algebra steps.\n\nSo, let's go through the steps again.\n\nOriginal numbers: 3x and 5x.\n\nAfter subtracting 9: 3x-9 and 5x-9.\n\nRatio (3x-9)/(5x-9) =12/23.\n\nCross-multiplying: 23*(3x-9) = 12*(5x-9).\n\nWhich gives 69x - 207 = 60x - 108.\n\nSubtract 60x: 9x -207 = -108.\n\nAdd 207: 9x = 99.\n\nx=11.\n\nSo 3x is 33, 5x is 55.\n\nWait, but wait, when I subtract 9 from each, 33-9=24, 55-9=46.\n\nAre 24 and 46 in the ratio 12:23?\n\nLet me check: 24 divided by 12 is 2, 46 divided by 23 is 2. So yes, 24:46 simplifies to 12:23. So that's correct.\n\nSo the smaller number is 33, which is option B.

Right, so ratios can be tricky, but I think I can handle this. Let me break it down. So, the original ratio is 3:5. That means if I let the numbers be 3 parts and 5 parts of something, right? Like, if each part is x, then the numbers would be 3x and 5x.\n\nSo, let me assign variables. Let me call the smaller number 3x and the larger one 5x. That makes sense because 3 is less than 5. Now, the problem says that if 9 is subtracted from each, the new ratio is 12:23. So, subtracting 9 from both gives (3x - 9) and (5x - 9), and their ratio is 12:23.\n\nWait, so the ratio of (3x -9) to (5x -9) is 12:23. To express this mathematically, I can write it as a fraction: (3x -9)/(5x -9) = 12/23.\n\nNow, I can solve this equation for x. Let me cross-multiply to get rid of the fractions. So, 23*(3x -9) = 12*(5x -9). Let me compute each side.\n\nFirst, the left side: 23*(3x -9) = 23*3x - 23*9. That's 69x - 207. Right side: 12*(5x -9) = 12*5x - 12*9, which is 60x - 108.\n\nSo now, the equation is 69x - 207 = 60x - 108. Let me get all the x terms on one side and constants on the other. Subtract 60x from both sides: 69x -60x -207 = -108. That becomes 9x -207 = -108.\n\nNow, add 207 to both sides to isolate the term with x. So, 9x = -108 + 207. Let's compute that. 207 minus 108 is 99, right? So 9x = 99. Then, x is 99 divided by 9. 99/9 is 11. So x = 11.\n\nWait, let me double-check that calculation. 9 times 11 is 99, yeah. So x is 11.

Subtract 60x from both sides: 69x -60x -207 = -108. That becomes 9x -207 = -108.\n\nNow, add 207 to both sides to isolate the term with x. So, 9x = -108 + 207. Let's compute that. 207 minus 108 is 99, right? So 9x = 99. Then, x is 99 divided by 9. 99/9 is 11. So x = 11.\n\nWait, let me double-check that calculation. 9 times 11 is 99, yeah. So x is 11. Now, the original numbers were 3x and 5x. So the smaller number is 3x = 3*11 = 33. Oh, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the cross-multiplication.\n\nLet me plug x=11 back into the equation to verify. Original numbers: 3*11=33 and 5*11=55. Subtract 9 from each: 33-9=24 and 55-9=46. Now, the ratio 24:46 simplifies to... Let's see, both divided by 2: 12:23. Oh, that's exactly what the problem states. So that checks out.\n\nSo the smaller number is 33. Looking at the options, option B is 33. So that's the answer.\n\n\nThe problem states that two numbers are in the ratio 3:5. Let the numbers be \\(3x\\) and \\(5x\\). When 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are \\((3x - 9)\\) and \\((5x - 9)\\), and their ratio becomes \\(12:23\\). This gives the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3x - 9}{5x - 9} = \\frac{12}{23}.\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n\\[\n23(3x - 9) = 12(5x - 9).\n\\]\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\n\\[\n69x - 207 = 60x - 108.\n\\]\n\nSubtracting \\(60x\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n9x - 207 = -108.\n\\]\n\nAdding 207 to both sides:\n\n\\[\n9x = 99.\n\\]\n\nDividing by 9:\n\n\\[\nx = 11.\n\\]\n\nThe original numbers are \\(3x\\) and \\(5x\\). Substituting \\(x = 11\\):\n\n\\[\n3x = 3 \\times 11 = 33, \\quad 5x = 5 \\times 11 = 55.\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 9 from each:\n\n\\[\n33 - 9 = 24, \\quad 55 - 9 = 46.\n\\]\n\nThe ratio \\(24:46\\) simplifies to \\(12:23\\), confirming the solution. The smaller number is \\(33\\), which corresponds to option B.\n\nAnswer: B",
