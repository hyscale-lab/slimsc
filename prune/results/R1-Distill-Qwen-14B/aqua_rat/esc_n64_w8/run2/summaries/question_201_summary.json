      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about simple interest and compound interest, and I need to find the rate of interest. Hmm, let me think. I remember that simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount, while compound interest is calculated on the principal plus any accumulated interest. \n\nThe problem says the difference between the two interests for Rs.5000 over 2 years is Rs.72. The options given are 10%, 12%, 6%, 8%, and 4%. I need to find which rate gives this difference.\n\nAlright, let's jot down the formulas. For simple interest, the formula is SI = (P * R * T)/100. So for Rs.5000, the SI would be (5000 * R * 2)/100. Simplifying that, it's 100R because 5000*2 is 10,000, divided by 100 gives 100R.\n\nFor compound interest, the formula is A = P*(1 + R/100)^T. The compound interest itself is A minus P. So CI = 5000*(1 + R/100)^2 - 5000. Expanding that, it's 5000[(1 + R/100)^2 - 1]. Let me compute that. \n\nWait, let me think about expanding (1 + R/100)^2. That would be 1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2. So when I subtract 1, it becomes 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2. Multiply that by 5000, the CI is 5000*(2R/100 + R\u00b2/(100)^2). Simplifying, that's 5000*(0.02R + 0.0001 R\u00b2) which is 100R + 0.5R\u00b2.\n\nWait, wait, let me recalculate that. 5000 * (2R/100) is 5000 * 0.02 R = 100 R. And 5000 * (R\u00b2/(100)^2) is 5000 * R\u00b2 / 10000 = 0.5 R\u00b2. So CI is 100R + 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nThe simple interest is 100R. The difference between CI and SI is given as 72. So CI - SI = (100R + 0.5 R\u00b2) - 100R = 0.5 R\u00b2 = 72.\n\nSo, 0.5 R\u00b2 = 72. Multiply both sides by 2: R\u00b2 = 144. Taking square roots, R = 12 or -12. Since rate can't be negative, R is 12%. So the answer should be option B)12%.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations. The difference is due to the extra term in CI, which is 0.5 R\u00b2. So 0.5 R\u00b2 =72 \u2192 R\u00b2=144 \u2192 R=12. Yep, that seems right.\n",

That would be 1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2. So when I subtract 1, it becomes 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2. Multiply that by 5000, the CI is 5000*(2R/100 + R\u00b2/(100)^2).

And 5000 * (R\u00b2/(100)^2) is 5000 * R\u00b2 / 10000 = 0.5 R\u00b2. So CI is 100R + 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nThe simple interest is 100R. The difference between CI and SI is given as 72. So CI - SI = (100R + 0.5 R\u00b2) - 100R = 0.5 R\u00b2 = 72.\n\nSo, 0.5 R\u00b2 = 72. Multiply both sides by 2: R\u00b2 = 144. Taking square roots, R = 12 or -12. Since rate can't be negative, R is 12%. So the answer should be option B)12%.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations. The difference is due to the extra term in CI, which is 0.5 R\u00b2.

I need to find the rate of interest. The options are A)10%, B)12%, C)6%, D)8%, E)4%.\n\nHmm, I remember that simple interest is calculated as SI = P * R * T, where P is principal, R is rate, and T is time.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about simple interest and compound interest. Let me see if I can figure it out step by step. The question says that the difference between simple interest (S.I.) and compound interest (C.I.) for Rs.5000 over 2 years is Rs.72. I need to find the rate of interest.\n\nHmm, I remember that simple interest is calculated as Principal \u00d7 Rate \u00d7 Time divided by 100. So S.I. = (P \u00d7 R \u00d7 T)/100. And compound interest, when compounded annually, is a bit different. It's calculated as Principal \u00d7 (1 + Rate/100)^Time minus the Principal. So C.I. = P \u00d7 (1 + R/100)^T - P.\n\nWait, but since the time is 2 years, I can calculate both interests and find their difference. The difference given is Rs.72. So I need to set up an equation where C.I. minus S.I. equals 72.\n\nLet me write down the formulas again. \n\nS.I. for 2 years would be (5000 \u00d7 R \u00d7 2)/100. That simplifies to 100 \u00d7 R, because 5000 \u00d7 2 is 10,000, divided by 100 is 100R.\n\nC.I. for 2 years is 5000 \u00d7 (1 + R/100)^2 minus 5000. Let me expand (1 + R/100)^2. That's 1 + 2(R/100) + (R/100)^2. So when I multiply by 5000, it becomes 5000 + 100R + (5000 \u00d7 R\u00b2)/(10000). Subtracting 5000 leaves 100R + (5000 \u00d7 R\u00b2)/(10000). Simplifying that, 5000/10000 is 0.5, so it becomes 100R + 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nWait, but S.I. is 100R, so the C.I. is 100R + 0.5 R\u00b2. So the difference between C.I. and S.I. is (100R + 0.5 R\u00b2) minus 100R, which is just 0.5 R squared. And this difference is given as 72. So:\n\n0.5 R\u00b2 = 72.\n\nWait, that makes sense? Because when you take C.I. minus S.I., the 100R terms cancel out, leaving just the interest from the second year's interest. Oh right, because compound interest earns interest on the interest from the first year.\n\nSo solving 0.5 R\u00b2 = 72. Let me write that as (R\u00b2)/2 =72. Multiply both sides by 2: R\u00b2= 144. So R is the square root of 144, which is 12. So the rate is 12%.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 12%. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about simple interest and compound interest. Let me see if I can figure it out step by step. The question says that the difference between simple interest (S.I.) and compound interest (C.I.) for Rs.5000 over 2 years is Rs.72. I need to find the rate of interest.\n\nHmm, I remember that simple interest is calculated as Principal \u00d7 Rate \u00d7 Time divided by 100. So S.I. = (P \u00d7 R \u00d7 T)/100. And compound interest, when compounded annually, is a bit different. It's calculated as Principal \u00d7 (1 + Rate/100)^Time minus the Principal. So C.I. = P \u00d7 (1 + R/100)^T - P.\n\nWait, but since the time is 2 years, I can calculate both interests and find their difference. The difference given is Rs.72. So I need to set up an equation where C.I. minus S.I. equals 72.\n\nLet me write down the formulas again. \n\nS.I. for 2 years would be (5000 \u00d7 R \u00d7 2)/100. That simplifies to 100 \u00d7 R, because 5000 \u00d7 2 is 10,000, divided by 100 is 100R.\n\nC.I. for 2 years is 5000 \u00d7 (1 + R/100)^2 minus 5000. Let me expand (1 + R/100)^2. That's 1 + 2(R/100) + (R/100)^2. So when I multiply by 5000, it becomes 5000 + 100R + (5000 \u00d7 R\u00b2)/(10000). Subtracting 5000 leaves 100R + (5000 \u00d7 R\u00b2)/(10000). Simplifying that, 5000/10000 is 0.5, so it becomes 100R + 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nWait, but S.I. is 100R, so the C.I. is 100R + 0.5 R\u00b2. So the difference between C.I. and S.I. is (100R + 0.5 R\u00b2) minus 100R, which is just 0.5 R squared. And this difference is given as 72. So:\n\n0.5 R\u00b2 = 72.\n\nWait, that makes sense? Because when you take C.I. minus S.I., the 100R terms cancel out, leaving just the interest from the second year's interest. Oh right, because compound interest earns interest on the interest from the first year.\n\nSo solving 0.5 R\u00b2 = 72. Let me write that as (R\u00b2)/2 =72. Multiply both sides by 2: R\u00b2= 144. So R is the square root of 144, which is 12. So the rate is 12%.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 12%. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If R is 12%, then S.I. for 2 years on 5000 would be (5000 *12 *2)/100 = (10000 *12)/100 = 1200.\n\nC.I. would be 5000*(1.12)^2 -5000. 1.12 squared is 1.2544. 5000 *1.2544 is 6272. Subtract 5000 gives 1272.\n\nThe difference between C.I. and S.I. is 1272 -1200 =72. Yes, that matches the given difference.

Since this is for two years, I think the C.I. would be calculated for the first year, and then the second year's interest would be on the new amount.\n\nWait, right. So the formula for simple interest is S.I. = P \u00d7 R \u00d7 T. For compound interest, for two years, it's P \u00d7 (1 + R)^T - P. Or wait, maybe it's P multiplied by (1 + R) squared minus P. Because each year, the interest is added to the principal. So for the first year, it's P \u00d7 R, and the second year, it's (P + P\u00d7R) \u00d7 R, which is P\u00d7(1+R)^2 - P. \n\nSo the difference between C.I. and S.I. for two years would be [P(1+R)^2 - P] - [P\u00d7R\u00d72]. Because S.I. for two years is P\u00d7R\u00d72, since it's simple, same each year.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. P is 5000, difference is 72. So:\n\nDifference = C.I. - S.I. = [5000(1 + R)^2 - 5000] - [5000 \u00d7 R \u00d7 2] = 72.\n\nLet me factor that out. 5000 is a common factor, so I can factor that out:\n\n5000 [ ( (1 + R)^2 -1 ) - 2R ] =72.\n\nWait, expanding that, (1 + R)^2 is 1 + 2R + R\u00b2. So subtracting 1 gives 2R + R\u00b2. Then subtract 2R: 2R + R\u00b2 - 2R = R\u00b2. So the equation becomes:\n\n5000 \u00d7 R\u00b2 =72.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because 5000 \u00d7 R\u00b2 =72. So R\u00b2 =72/5000 = 0.0144. So R would be sqrt(0.0144) = 0.12, which is 12%. So the rate is 12% per annum. Hmm, but let me double-check my steps because that seems a bit high, but maybe that's correct.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me re-derive the difference formula. Because I might have made a mistake in the setup. The difference between C.I. and S.I. for two years is actually P*( (1+R)^2 -1 ) - P*R*2. Let me compute that again.\n\nSo C.I. is P*(1+R)^2 - P = P*( (1+R)^2 -1 ). S.I. is P*R*2. So the difference is:\n\nC.I. - S.I. = P*( (1+R)^2 -1 ) - P*R*2.\n\nExpanding (1+R)^2 gives 1 + 2R + R\u00b2. So subtract 1, that becomes 2R + R\u00b2. So:\n\nC.I. - S.I. = P*(2R + R\u00b2) - 2PR.\n\nWhich simplifies to P*R\u00b2, because 2PR - 2PR cancels out, leaving P*R\u00b2. So the difference is P R squared.\n\nWait, so that's 5000 * R^2 =72. So R^2 =72/5000 = 0.0144. R is sqrt(0.0144) which is 0.12, so 12%.\n\nBut wait, wait another thing. The difference between C.I. and S.I. for two years is P R\u00b2. So for Rs.5000, R is 12%, that makes the difference 5000 * (0.12)^2 = 5000 *0.0144 =72. Which matches the given difference.\n\nSo the rate is 12%, which is option B.\n\nBut let me think again, because sometimes I might confuse the formulas.

Hmm, I need to find the rate of interest when the difference between SI and CI on Rs.5000 for 2 years is Rs.72. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, I remember that simple interest is calculated using the formula SI = (P * R * T)/100, where P is principal, R is rate, and T is time. For compound interest, the formula is a bit different. Since it's compounded annually, the formula would be CI = P*(1 + R/100)^T - P. Oh wait, but I think for two years, CI can also be expanded as P*(1 + R/100)^2 - P, right?\n\nThe problem says the difference between CI and SI is Rs.72. So I can write the equation as CI - SI = 72. Let's plug in the formulas.\n\nSo, CI is 5000*(1 + R/100)^2 - 5000. SI is (5000*R*2)/100. The difference is CI - SI = 72.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n5000*(1 + R/100)^2 - 5000 - (5000*R*2)/100 = 72.\n\nHmm, maybe I can factor out 5000 to simplify.

So,\n\n(1 + R/100)^2 - 1 - (2R/100) = 0.0144.\n\nLet me expand (1 + R/100)^2. That would be 1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2. So substituting back:\n\n[1 + 2*(R/100) + (R^2)/(10000)] -1 - (2R/100) = 0.0144.\n\nSimplify the left side. The 1 and -1 cancel out. The 2R/100 and -2R/100 also cancel. So we're left with (R^2)/(10000) = 0.0144.\n\nSo R squared over 10000 equals 0.0144. Multiply both sides by 10000:\n\nR^2 = 0.0144 * 10000.\n\nCalculating that: 0.0144 * 10000 = 144.\n\nSo R squared is 144. Taking the square root of both sides, R = 12. Because rate can't be negative, so 12% is the answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If R is 12%, then let's compute SI and CI.\n\nSI: (5000 * 12 * 2)/100 = (5000 *24)/100 = (120000)/100 = 1200.\n\nCI: 5000*(1 + 12/100)^2 -5000. 12% is 0.12, so 1.12 squared is 1.2544. Multiply by 5000: 5000 *1.2544 = 6272. Subtract 5000, CI is 1272.\n\nDifference: 1272 - 1200 = 72. Yep, that matches. So the rate is 12%, which is option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about simple interest and compound interest. Hmm, I need to find the rate of interest when the difference between SI and CI on Rs.5000 for 2 years is Rs.72. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, I remember that simple interest is calculated using the formula SI = (P * R * T)/100, where P is principal, R is rate, and T is time. For compound interest, the formula is a bit different. Since it's compounded annually, the formula would be CI = P*(1 + R/100)^T - P. Oh wait, but I think for two years, CI can also be expanded as P*(1 + R/100)^2 - P, right?\n\nThe problem says the difference between CI and SI is Rs.72. So I can write the equation as CI - SI = 72. Let's plug in the formulas.\n\nSo, CI is 5000*(1 + R/100)^2 - 5000. SI is (5000*R*2)/100. The difference is CI - SI = 72.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n5000*(1 + R/100)^2 - 5000 - (5000*R*2)/100 = 72.\n\nHmm, maybe I can factor out 5000 to simplify.

Hmm, I remember that simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount, while compound interest is calculated on the principal plus any accumulated interest. \n\nThe question says the difference between the two interests for Rs.5000 over 2 years is Rs.72. I need to find the rate of interest. The options are given, but I'll try to figure it out myself first.\n\nLet me jot down the formulas I remember. Simple Interest (SI) is (P * R * T)/100, where P is principal, R is rate, T is time. So for 2 years, SI would be (5000 * R * 2)/100. That simplifies to 100R because 5000*2 is 10,000, divided by 100 is 100, so 100R.\n\nCompound Interest (CI) is a bit trickier. The formula for CI when compounded annually is P*(1 + R/100)^T - P. So for 2 years, that would be 5000*(1 + R/100)^2 - 5000. Let's expand that. The (1 + R/100)^2 is 1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2. So when I subtract 5000, the CI becomes 5000*(2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2).\n\nWait, maybe I should compute it step by step. CI after 2 years is 5000*( (1 + R/100)^2 - 1 ). Expanding (1 + R/100)^2 gives 1 + 2(R/100) + (R^2)/(10000). So subtracting 1, it's 2(R/100) + (R^2)/(10000). Multiply by 5000, CI becomes 5000*(2R/100 + R\u00b2/(10000)).\n\nSimplifying that, 5000*(2R/100) is 5000 * 2R / 100. 5000 divided by 100 is 50, multiplied by 2R gives 100R. The second term is 5000 * R\u00b2/(10000) which is (5000/10000)*R\u00b2 = 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nSo CI is 100R + 0.5R\u00b2.\n\nNow, the difference between CI and SI is given as 72. So CI - SI = 72. Substituting the expressions I have:\n\n(100R + 0.5R\u00b2) - (100R) = 72.\n\nWait, that simplifies to 0.5R\u00b2 =72. Because the 100R cancels out. So 0.5R\u00b2 =72.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2: R\u00b2 = 144. Taking square root, R is 12 or -12. But rate can't be negative, so R=12%.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes, when I'm dealing with CI, I might have made a mistake in the expansion.\n\nLet me recalculate the CI formula. CI for 2 years is P*( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 ). So for P=5000, that's 5000*( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 ). Let's compute (1 + R/100)^2: that's 1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2. Subtract 1, so 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2. Multiply by 5000:\n\n5000 * [2*(R/100)] = 5000 * 2R /100 = 100R.\n\n5000 * (R/100)^2 = 5000 * R\u00b2 /10000 = (5000/10000)*R\u00b2 = 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nSo CI is 100R +0.5R\u00b2, as I thought earlier. SI is 100R. So the difference is 0.5 R\u00b2 =72.\n\nYes, that's correct. So 0.5 R\u00b2 =72 \u2192 R\u00b2=144 \u2192 R=12%. So the answer is option B)12%.\n\nWait, but wait another thing.

Let's compute 1.12 squared. 1.12 *1.12 = 1.2544. So 5000 *1.2544 = 6272. CI is 6272-5000=1272.\n\nSo the difference is 1272 -1200=72. Yes, that's correct. So R=12% is correct.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about simple interest and compound interest. Let me try to understand what it's asking. Hmm, the question says the difference between simple interest (S.I.) and compound interest (C.I.) on Rs.5000 for 2 years is Rs.72. I need to find the rate of interest. The options are given from A to E.\n\nWait, I remember that simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount, whereas compound interest is calculated on the principal plus any accumulated interest. So for two years, the difference between C.I. and S.I. should be the interest on the first year's interest, right? Because in the first year, both give the same amount, but in the second year, C.I. earns interest on the first year's interest.\n\nLet me jot down the formulas. Simple Interest is S.I. = P * R * T / 100. For two years, that would be 5000 * R * 2 / 100. Which simplifies to 100R, since 5000 *2 is 10,000, divided by 100 is 100. So S.I. is 100R.\n\nCompound Interest for two years is a bit different. The formula is C.I. = P*(1 + R/100)^T - P. So plugging in the numbers: 5000*(1 + R/100)^2 -5000. Let me expand that. (1 + R/100)^2 is 1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2. So when multiplied by 5000, it's 5000 + 100R + (5000*(R^2)/(10000)). Subtracting the principal (5000), the C.I. becomes 100R + (5000 R\u00b2)/(10000). Simplifying that, 5000/10000 is 0.5, so it's 100R + 0.5R\u00b2.\n\nWait, so the C.I. is 100R + 0.5R\u00b2. The S.I. is 100R. So the difference between C.I. and S.I. is 0.5R\u00b2. And the problem states this difference is Rs.72. So 0.5 R\u00b2 =72. Solving for R: R\u00b2=72*2=144. So R is sqrt(144)=12. So the rate is 12%. Hmm, let me double-check that because sometimes I might mix up the formulas.\n\nWait another way: the difference between C.I. and S.I. for two years is P*(R/100)^2. Because C.I. is P*(1+R/100)^2 - P, which is P*( (1 + 2R/100 + R\u00b2/(100^2)) -1 ) = P*(2R/100 + R\u00b2/(100^2)). S.I. is P*R*T/100 = P*R*2/100 = 2PR/100. So the difference is C.I. - S.I. = P*(2R/100 + R\u00b2/(100^2)) - 2PR/100. That simplifies to P*(R\u00b2/(100^2)). So P*(R\u00b2)/(10000) = difference.\n\nWait wait, that's another approach. So using this, the difference is 5000*(R^2)/(10000) = 72. So 5000 R\u00b2 / 10000 =72 \u2192 R\u00b2 = (72 *10000)/5000 \u2192 R\u00b2 = (72 *2)=144. So R is 12%. That matches the previous method. So the rate is 12%, which is option B.\n\nWait, but in the first approach, I had 0.5 R\u00b2 equals 72, which also gives R\u00b2=144. So same result. So the correct answer should be B)12%.\n",

So the difference is C.I. - S.I. = P*(2R/100 + R\u00b2/(100^2)) - 2PR/100. That simplifies to P*(R\u00b2/(100^2)). So P*(R\u00b2)/(10000) = difference.\n\nWait wait, that's another approach.

I'm a bit rusty on these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nThe question says that the difference between simple interest (SI) and compound interest (CI) for Rs.5000 over 2 years is Rs.72. I need to find the rate of interest. The options are A to E, with rates like 10%, 12%, etc.\n\nHmm, I remember that simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount, while compound interest is calculated on the principal plus any accumulated interest from previous periods. So for two years, the CI will have interest on the first year's interest as well.\n\nLet me jot down the formulas I remember. \n\nThe formula for simple interest is:\nSI = (P * R * T) / 100\nWhere P is principal, R is rate, T is time in years.\n\nFor compound interest, especially when compounded annually, the formula is:\nCI = P * (1 + R/100)^T - P\n\nThe problem says the difference between CI and SI is Rs.72. So, CI - SI = 72.\n\nThe principal P is 5000, and time T is 2 years. So I can plug these values into the equations.\n\nLet me compute SI first. SI = (5000 * R * 2)/100. Simplify that, 5000 * 2 is 10,000, so SI = (10,000 * R) /100 \u2192 which is 100 R.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 5000 * R *2 /100. Let me calculate that again. 5000 * R is 5000R, multiplied by 2 is 10,000R, divided by 100 is 100R. Oh right, so SI is 100R.\n\nNow for CI. The formula is P*(1 + R/100)^T - P. So for T=2, that's 5000*(1 + R/100)^2 - 5000.\n\nLet me expand (1 + R/100)^2. That's 1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2. So the CI would be 5000*(1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2) -5000.\n\nWhich simplifies to 5000*2*(R/100) + 5000*(R/100)^2. That's because the 5000*1 cancels with the -5000.\n\nSo the CI is 5000*(2R/100 + R\u00b2/(100)^2). Let me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 5000 * (2R/100) = 5000*(R/50) = 100R.\n\nSecond term: 5000*(R\u00b2)/(10000) = (5000 R\u00b2)/10000 \u2192 which simplifies to (R\u00b2)/2.\n\nSo CI = 100R + (R\u00b2)/2.\n\nWait, but SI is 100R. So the difference between CI and SI is (100R + R\u00b2/2) - 100R = R\u00b2/2.\n\nBut according to the problem, the difference is 72. So R\u00b2/2 =72 \u2192 R\u00b2 = 144 \u2192 R = sqrt(144) \u2192 R=12 or -12. But since rate can't be negative, R is 12%. So the answer should be B)12%.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nLet me go through the steps again. \n\nCI for two years is P*(1 + R/100)^2 - P. So for P=5000, it's 5000*(1 + R/100)^2 -5000.\n\nExpanding that, it's 5000*(1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2) -5000 \u2192 5000*(2*(R/100)) + 5000*(R/100)^2.\n\nWhich is 5000*(2R/100) = (5000 * 2R)/100 = (10,000 R)/100 = 100R. Then 5000*(R\u00b2)/(10000) \u2192 (5000 R\u00b2)/10000 = 0.5 R\u00b2. So CI is 100R + 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nSI is 100R, so the difference is 0.5 R\u00b2. Setting that equal to 72, 0.5 R\u00b2 =72 \u2192 R\u00b2=144 \u2192 R=12%.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the rate is 12%, which is option B.\n",
