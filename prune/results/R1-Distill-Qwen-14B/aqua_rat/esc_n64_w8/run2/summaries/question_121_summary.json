      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a group of boys and girls. Let me see if I can figure it out. Hmm, the problem says that there are 64 boys and 40 girls in the group initially. Then, during their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined. Now, the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3. I need to find out how many members are in the group now.\n\nWait, so let me break this down. The initial numbers are 64 boys and 40 girls. Let's call the number of boys and girls who joined the group 'x'. So after the new members join, the number of boys becomes 64 + x, and the number of girls becomes 40 + x.\n\nThe ratio of boys to girls after the drive is 4:3. So, the ratio can be written as (64 + x)/(40 + x) = 4/3. Oh right, because the ratio is boys to girls, so boys over girls equals 4 over 3.\n\nNow I can set up that equation. Cross-multiplying should help. So, 3*(64 + x) = 4*(40 + x). Let me compute that.\n\n3*(64) is 192, and 3x is 3x. On the right side, 4*(40) is 160, and 4x is 4x. So the equation becomes 192 + 3x = 160 + 4x.\n\nHmm, let's solve for x. I can subtract 3x from both sides, which gives me 192 = 160 + x. Then subtract 160 from both sides: 192 -160 is 32, so 32 = x. So x is 32.\n\nWait, that means 32 boys and 32 girls joined the group. So the new numbers are:\n\nBoys: 64 +32 =96\nGirls:40 +32=72\n\nNow, the total number of members is 96 +72. Let me add those up. 96 +72 is 168. Wait, but wait the options given are A)277, B)288, C)200, D)277, E)168. Oh, option E is 168. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake. So initial boys 64, added 32: 64 +32=96. Girls 40+32=72. 96 +72=168. Ratio is 96:72. Let me see if that's 4:3. 96 divided by 24 is 4, 72 divided by 24 is 3. So yes, 4:3. That's correct.\n\nSo the total members now are 168. So the correct option is E.\n",

Then, during a membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. Now, the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3. We need to find the total number of members now. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me note down the initial numbers. Initially, there are 64 boys and 40 girls. So the starting point is 64 boys and 40 girls.\n\nLet me denote the number of boys and girls that joined as x each. Since the same number of boys and girls joined, I can use the same variable for both. So, the number of boys now would be 64 + x, and the number of girls would be 40 + x.\n\nThe ratio of boys to girls after the new members joined is given as 4:3. So, I can set up a ratio equation. The ratio of (64 + x) to (40 + x) should be equal to 4/3. \n\nSo, mathematically, that's (64 + x)/(40 + x) = 4/3.\n\nI can solve this equation for x. Let's cross-multiply to get rid of the fractions. So, 3*(64 + x) = 4*(40 + x).\n\nLet me compute both sides. On the left side, 3*(64 + x) is 192 + 3x. On the right side, 4*(40 + x) is 160 + 4x.\n\nSo, the equation becomes 192 + 3x = 160 + 4x.\n\nHmm, let's subtract 160 from both sides: 192 - 160 is 32, so 32 +3x =4x.\n\nWait, subtract 3x from both sides: 32 = x.\n\nSo, x equals 32.

The problem states that the same number of boys and girls joined, so let's say 'x' boys and 'x' girls joined. So, B = 64 + x, and G = 40 + x.\n\nThe ratio of boys to girls after the drive is 4:3. So, B/G = 4/3. Plugging in the expressions for B and G:\n\n(64 + x)/(40 + x) = 4/3.\n\nNow, I can solve for x. Cross-multiplying:\n\n3*(64 + x) = 4*(40 + x).\n\nLet me calculate that. 3*64 is 192, and 3x. On the other side, 4*40 is 160, and 4x. So:\n\n192 + 3x = 160 + 4x.\n\nHmm, I can rearrange this. Subtract 3x from both sides:\n\n192 = 160 + x.\n\nThen, subtract 160 from both sides:\n\n192 - 160 = x.\n\nWhich is 32 = x. So, x is 32. That means 32 boys and 32 girls joined the group.\n\nNow, let's find out the new numbers. Boys: 64 + 32 = 96. Girls: 40 +32=72.\n\nWait, let me check that math. 64+32 is indeed 96, and 40+32 is 72. Now, the total number of members now is 96 boys +72 girls. Adding them together: 96 +72 = 168.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 168. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait a second, but I'm seeing that the options have A and D as 277. Did I make a mistake? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me see: same number of boys and girls joined. So, yes, x each. So, initial boys 64, girls 40. After adding x, the ratio becomes 4:3.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the ratio again. So, 96 boys and 72 girls. 96 divided by 72 is 4/3? Let's see: 96/72 = 4/3? 72 times 4 is 288, and 96 times 3 is 288. Yes, that's correct. So the ratio is right.\n\nSo the total is 168. Looking at the options, E is 168. So the answer is E.\n\nWait, but why are options A and D the same? Maybe that's a mistake, but I think my approach is correct. So I'm confident the answer is E.\n",

Let's see, the problem says that there are 64 boys and 40 girls in a group for social work. Then, during their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. Now, the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, and we need to find out how many members are in the group now.\n\nHmm, so the initial numbers are 64 boys and 40 girls. Let me write that down. Boys = 64, Girls = 40. Then, the same number of boys and girls joined. Let's call the number of boys and girls that joined as x. So, after the addition, the number of boys becomes 64 + x, and the number of girls becomes 40 + x.\n\nNow, the ratio of boys to girls after these additions is 4:3. So, the ratio (64 + x)/(40 + x) equals 4/3. I think that's how ratios work. So I can set up an equation: (64 + x)/(40 + x) = 4/3.\n\nWait, let me make sure I got that right. Yeah, because the new number of boys divided by new number of girls equals 4/3. So cross-multiplying to solve for x. So 3*(64 + x) = 4*(40 + x). Let me compute that.\n\n3 times 64 is 192, and 3 times x is 3x. On the right side, 4 times 40 is 160, and 4 times x is 4x. So the equation becomes 192 + 3x = 160 + 4x.\n\nHmm, let me rearrange this. I'll subtract 3x from both sides: 192 = 160 + x. Then subtract 160 from both sides: 32 = x. So x is 32.\n\nWait, that means 32 boys and 32 girls joined the group. So the new numbers are 64 + 32 = 96 boys, and 40 + 32 = 72 girls. Now, the total number of members is 96 +72. Let me add that up. 96 plus 70 is 166, plus 2 more is 168. So the total is 168.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 168. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I make mistakes in arithmetic. Let me re-calculate the equation.\n\nStarting again: (64 + x)/(40 + x) = 4/3.\n\nCross-multiplying: 3*(64 + x) =4*(40 +x)\n\nCompute each side: 3*64 is 192, 3x. 4*40 is 160, 4x.\n\nSo 192 +3x = 160 +4x.\n\nSubtract 3x: 192 = 160 +x.\n\nSubtract 160: 32 =x. So x is 32. Correct.\n\nSo boys become 64+32=96, girls 40+32=72. Total 96+72=168. So the total is 168.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. \n\nThe problem says that there are 64 boys and 40 girls in a group for social work. Then, during their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. Now, the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3. The question is, how many members does the group have now? The options are A) 277, B) 288, C) 200, D) 277, E) 168. Wait, wait, I see A and D are both 277. That's probably a typo, but okay, maybe the correct answer is one of those. \n\nSo, let's break it down. Initially, there are 64 boys and 40 girls. Let me denote the number of boys as B = 64, girls as G = 40. Then, during the membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined. Let's say the number of boys that joined is x, and the number of girls that joined is also x. So, the new numbers would be B_new = 64 + x and G_new = 40 + x.\n\nThe problem states that the ratio of boys to girls now is 4:3. So, the ratio of B_new to G_new is 4/3. So, I can set up the equation (64 + x)/(40 + x) = 4/3.\n\nHmm, I need to solve for x. Let's cross-multiply to solve for x. So, 3*(64 + x) = 4*(40 + x). Let's compute each side.\n\nLeft side: 3*(64 + x) = 3*64 + 3x = 192 + 3x.\n\nRight side: 4*(40 + x) = 4*40 +4x = 160 +4x.\n\nSo, the equation becomes 192 + 3x = 160 +4x.\n\nHmm, subtract 3x from both sides: 192 = 160 + x.\n\nWait, because 192 +3x -3x is 192, and 160 +4x -3x is 160 +x.\n\nSo, 192 = 160 + x.\n\nNow, subtract 160 from both sides: 192 -160 = x.\n\n192 minus 160 is 32, so x=32.\n\nOkay, so 32 boys and 32 girls joined the group. So, the new numbers are:\n\nBoys: 64 +32 =96.\n\nGirls:40 +32=72.\n\nSo, the total number of members now is 96 +72. Let me add that up. 96+72 is 168.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 168. So, that's the answer? But wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait, 96 boys and 72 girls. Let me check the ratio. 96:72. Let's divide both by 24. 96/24=4, 72/24=3. So, 4:3. Yep, that's correct. So the total is 96+72=168, which is option E.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, I see that option E is 168. So that's the correct choice. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, initial boys:64, girls:40. Adding 32 each: 64+32=96, 40+32=72. Ratio is 96:72. Divide both by 24, indeed 4:3. So correct. So total is 168, which is E.\n\nBut wait, looking back, the options are A)277, B)288, C)200, D)277, E)168. So E is 168, which matches my calculation. So the answer should be E.\n",

Now, the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3. The question is asking how many members are in the group now. The options are given as A to E.\n\nHmm, so let's break it down. Initially, there are 64 boys and 40 girls. Let me note that down. So initially:\n\nBoys = 64\nGirls = 40\n\nThen, some number of boys and the same number of girls join.
