      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a hollow cube. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the cube is 5 cm in size, but the thickness is 1 cm. Oh right, that means it's made up of smaller 1 cm cubes. So the big cube is like a shell with hollow inside.\n\nWait, so the big cube is 5 cm on each side. But since the thickness is 1 cm, that means the inner dimensions are smaller. Because the thickness is 1 cm on each side, the inner cube must be 3 cm on each edge, right? Because 5 minus 2 times 1 cm thickness (since it's on both ends) gives 3 cm.\n\nSo the big cube is 5x5x5, which is 125 smaller cubes in total. The inner hollow part is 3x3x3, which is 27 cubes. So the number of small cubes that make up the hollow part is 125 - 27 = 98 cubes. But wait, I'm not sure if I'm calculating this right. Oh, wait, the question is about the painted faces. So maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nThe problem says the outer surface is painted. So only the outer faces of the big cube are painted. Now, for each small cube, how many of their faces are painted? Well, the cubes on the corners will have 3 painted faces, those on edges (but not corners) will have 2, and those on the faces (but not edges) will have 1. The inner cubes won't have any paint.\n\nBut the question is asking for the total number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted. Wait, no. Let me read again. Oh, no, it's how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted. So for each small cube, count the number of unpainted faces, then sum all of them.\n\nWait, that's a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the total number of painted faces and subtract that from the total possible. Because each small cube has 6 faces, so for all 125 small cubes, total faces are 125 *6=750. Then, the painted ones are those on the surface.\n\nBut wait, the big cube's outer surfaces are painted. So how many faces are painted in total on all the small cubes?\n\nLet me think: The big cube has 6 faces. Each face is 5x5=25 small faces. So 6*25=150 painted small cube faces. But wait, no, because each small cube's face is part of the big cube's face. So each painted face on the big cube corresponds to one face of a small cube.\n\nSo total painted small cube faces are 150. Therefore, the unpainted faces would be 750 - 150 = 600. But that can't be right because the options don't have 600. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Oh wait, because the cube is hollow, the inner part doesn't have any paint, but the question is about the small cubes that are part of the hollow cube. Wait, no. Wait, the big cube is hollow, so the inner 3x3x3 cubes are not part of the structure. Wait, no, the big cube is made of small cubes, but the inner part is hollow, so the small cubes are only on the surface. So the hollow part is empty. So the big cube is made up of 5x5x5 = 125 small cubes, but the hollow part is 3x3x3 =27, which are not present. So the actual number of small cubes is 125 -27=98? No, wait, wait, no. Wait, no, the thickness is 1 cm, so the outer layer is 1 cm, meaning that the big cube is 5x5x5, and the hollow part is 3x3x3. So the number of small cubes making up the structure is 5^3 -3^3 =125-27=98. So the hollow part is empty.\n\nSo each of these 98 small cubes is part of the structure. Now, when the outer surface is painted, each of their outer faces (on the big cube's surfaces) gets painted. So each small cube on the surface will have some painted faces.\n\nWait, but the question is about how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted. So for each small cube, count the number of their faces that are not on the big cube's surface. So for each small cube, the number of unpainted faces is 6 minus the number of their faces that are on the exterior.\n\nBut wait, some small cubes are on edges or corners, so they have multiple faces on the exterior. For example, a corner cube has 3 exterior faces, so its unpainted faces would be 6-3=3.\n\nHmm, but calculating this for each cube might be tedious. Maybe a better approach is to compute the total number of small cube faces, subtract the number of painted small cube faces.\n\nTotal small cube faces: 98 *6 =588.\n\nPainted small cube faces: Each face of the big cube has (5x5)=25 small cube faces. But wait, the big cube's face has 25 small cube faces painted. There are 6 faces, so 6*25=150. But wait, some of those are overlapping because the edges are shared between two faces. But in terms of the small cubes, each face of the big cube has 25 painted small cube faces, regardless of the cube's position. So the total painted small cube faces are 150. So the unpainted would be 588 -150=438. Oh, wait, that's one of the options. Option A is 438.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check. Because the 5x5x5 cube's surfaces have 6*25=150. So the painted small cube faces are 150. The total small cubes are 98, each with 6 faces, so 98*6=588. 588 -150=438. That's option A.\n\nSo the answer should be A)438.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a hollow cube, and I need to figure out how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted after the outer surface is painted. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the cube is hollow, right? And the size is 5cm. Wait, does that mean each edge is 5cm long? Because a cube has edges of equal length. So the cube is 5cm on each side. But the thickness is 1cm. Oh, so it's like a box made up of smaller cubes. The thickness being 1cm means that the walls of the hollow cube are 1cm thick. So the inner part would be a smaller cube, maybe?\n\nThe cube is made up of 1cm\u00b3 smaller cubes. So each small cube is 1cm in size. Let me visualize this. The big cube is 5cm on each edge, so normally it would have 5 x 5 x 5 = 125 small cubes if it were solid. But since it's hollow with 1cm thickness, the inner part is a smaller cube. How much smaller? Well, the thickness is 1cm, so the inner cube would have each edge 5 - 2*1 = 3cm. Because you subtract 1cm from each side. So the inner dimensions are 3x3x3. So the total number of small cubes is the outer 5x5x5 minus the inner 3x3x3. That would be 125 - 27 = 98 small cubes. Wait, but the question is about the faces, not the cubes themselves.\n\nThe problem says the outer surface is painted. So all the outer faces of the big cube are painted. Then, we need to find how many faces of the small cubes are unpainted.\n\nEach small cube can have 0 to 3 painted faces, depending on their position. But the question is about the total number of faces that are not painted. So each small cube contributes 6 faces, but some are painted, others are not.\n\nWait, but perhaps a better approach is to calculate the total number of painted faces and subtract that from the total possible faces to get the unpainted ones. Or maybe calculate the unpainted directly.\n\nLet me think: Each face of the big cube is 5x5=25 small faces. So there are 6 faces, each with 25 small faces. So total painted small cube faces would be 6 *25=150. But wait, that's not correct because the edges and corners are shared between multiple faces. Oh wait, no, in this case, when the big cube is painted on the outside, each face is a 5x5 grid of small faces. So each face has 25 small painted faces, and all 6 are painted. So total painted small cube faces are 6 *25=150. But wait, no, because each small cube on the edge is part of two big faces. Oh wait, but each small cube's face is only counted once. Wait, no, because the small cube's face is on one side. So the total painted small cube faces are 6*(5*5) = 150.\n\nWait, but the small cubes on edges and corners are part of multiple big cube's faces. For example, a corner cube is part of three big cube's faces, so each of its three faces is painted. So when calculating the total number of painted small cube faces, each such face is only counted once because each face is part of a single big cube's face.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Each big face has 25 small faces, all of which are painted. So regardless of whether the small cube is on an edge or a corner, each face painted on the big cube's surface is a single face of a small cube. So the total painted small cube faces are 6 * 5*5=150.\n\nBut wait, no. Because each small cube's face is part of only one big cube's face. So a small cube on the corner has three faces painted, but each of those is part of a different big cube's face. So the count is correct. So 150 is the total painted small cube faces.\n\nBut wait, the cube is hollow. So the inner part is empty, and the small cubes are only on the outer 1cm layer. So the small cubes are only on the surface, but their inner parts are not present. So each small cube is on the surface, but their inner parts (like the inner 3x3x3) are empty. So the small cubes that are on the exterior are those in the first layer.\n\nSo, the small cubes are all in the outer 1cm layer. Each of these has some faces painted and some not. The ones on the edges and corners have more painted faces, and the ones in the middle of a face have fewer.\n\nBut since the cube is hollow, the small cubes in the outer layer don't have any cubes behind them. So their inner faces (the ones facing the hollow) are not painted. So for each small cube on the outer layer, the faces that are on the outside are painted, and the inner faces (towards the hollow) are not.\n\nSo each small cube in the outer layer has some number of painted faces (0 to 3) and the rest are unpainted. So the total unpainted faces would be the sum of all small cube faces minus the painted ones.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Each small cube in the outer layer contributes some number of faces that are unpainted. Let's find the total number of small cube faces in the entire structure, then subtract the painted ones to get the unpainted.\n\nEach small cube has 6 faces. How many small cubes are there? As I thought before, the big cube is 5x5x5=125, and the hollow part is 3x3x3=27. So the number of small cubes is 125-27=98.\n\nSo the total number of small cube faces is 98 *6=588.\n\nBut wait, wait a minute. Wait, each small cube is on the surface, but each cube is part of the structure. So the 98 small cubes each have 6 faces, but some of those faces are on the outside (painted) and others are on the inside (unpainted, towards the hollow) or adjacent to other small cubes.\n\nBut no, the small cubes are on the surface, so their inner faces (the ones facing the hollow) are not painted. So for each small cube, the number of painted faces depends on whether they're on a face, edge, or corner.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the total number of small cube faces, subtract the painted ones (which are 150), and the remainder is the unpainted.\n\nBut wait, no, because some of the small cube's faces are adjacent to each other, so they are internal and not painted. So each face between two small cubes is internal and not painted. So the total unpainted faces would be the sum of all internal faces plus the internal faces of the hollow.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let's calculate the total number of small cube faces in the entire structure, then subtract the number of painted faces (150) and the number of internal (adjacent) faces. Because those adjacent faces are between small cubes and are not painted.\n\nBut how many internal faces are there?\n\nEach small cube in the structure (which is the outer layer) can have up to 6 faces, but some are on the surface (painted), and others are adjacent to other small cubes (unpainted) or to the hollow (unpainted).\n\nWait, maybe the number of internal faces is the sum of the number of connections between small cubes. Each connection between two small cubes represents two faces (one on each cube), but each connection is counted once.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to calculate the number of internal faces as follows. The structure is a 5x5x5 cube with a 3x3x3 hollow. The small cubes are arranged in a shell. The number of internal faces (faces between small cubes) can be calculated as the number of connections in each dimension.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of it as the entire structure (the 5x5x5 cube) has a certain number of internal faces, but since it's hollow, some of those are not present.\n\nWait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Let me think again.\n\nEach small cube in the structure (the 98) has some faces on the exterior (painted) and some faces adjacent to other small cubes or to the hollow.\n\nThe unpainted faces would be the faces that are either adjacent to another small cube (so internal, not painted) or adjacent to the hollow (so not painted either).\n\nWait, so for each small cube, the number of unpainted faces is 6 minus the number of painted faces.\n\nBut perhaps instead of dealing with each cube, we can calculate the total number of unpainted faces in the entire structure.\n\nTotal small cube faces: 98 *6=588.\n\nTotal painted faces: 6*5*5=150.\n\nSo the unpainted faces would be 588 -150=438. But wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no. Because some of the small cube's faces are adjacent to other small cubes (so internal, not painted), and others are adjacent to the hollow (unpainted). So the 588 includes all faces, including the ones that are internal between small cubes and the ones that are adjacent to the hollow.\n\nBut the 150 is the number of painted faces on the outside. So the total unpainted is 588 -150 = 438.\n\nBut wait, the options include 438 (option A). So that would be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nWait, the structure is a hollow cube with outer dimensions 5x5x5 and thickness 1 cm. So each face has a 5x5 grid of small cubes, each contributing one face to the big cube's face. So 6*25=150 painted small cube faces.\n\nThe total small cube faces are 98*6=588.\n\nSo unpainted would be 588-150=438. So the answer should be 438, which is option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the count of small cubes. Let me confirm.\n\nThe total number of small cubes in the big cube is 5^3=125.\n\nThe hollow part is 3^3=27.\n\nSo the number of small cubes is 125-27=98. Correct.\n\nEach has 6 faces, so 588. Correct.\n\nSo 588-150=438. So the answer is A.\n",

So total painted small cube faces would be 6 *25=150. But wait, that's not correct because the edges and corners are shared between multiple faces. Oh wait, no, in this case, when the big cube is painted on the outside, each face is a 5x5 grid of small faces. So each face has 25 small painted faces, and all 6 are painted. So total painted small cube faces are 6 *25=150. But wait, no, because each small cube on the edge is part of two big faces. Oh wait, but each small cube's face is only counted once. Wait, no, because the small cube's face is on one side. So the total painted small cube faces are 6*(5*5) = 150.\n\nWait, but the small cubes on edges and corners are part of multiple big cube's faces. For example, a corner cube is part of three big cube's faces, so each of its three faces is painted. So when calculating the total number of painted small cube faces, each such face is only counted once because each face is part of a single big cube's face.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Each big face has 25 small faces, all of which are painted. So regardless of whether the small cube is on an edge or a corner, each face painted on the big cube's surface is a single face of a small cube. So the total painted small cube faces are 6 * 5*5=150.\n\nBut wait, no. Because each small cube's face is part of only one big cube's face. So a small cube on the corner has three faces painted, but each of those is part of a different big cube's face. So the count is correct. So 150 is the total painted small cube faces.\n\nBut wait, the cube is hollow. So the inner part is empty, and the small cubes are only on the outer 1cm layer. So the small cubes are only on the surface, but their inner parts are not present. So each small cube is on the surface, but their inner parts (like the inner 3x3x3) are empty. So the small cubes that are on the exterior are those in the first layer.\n\nSo, the small cubes are all in the outer 1cm layer. Each of these has some faces painted and some not. The ones on the edges and corners have more painted faces, and the ones in the middle of a face have fewer.\n\nBut since the cube is hollow, the small cubes in the outer layer don't have any cubes behind them. So their inner faces (the ones facing the hollow) are not painted. So for each small cube on the outer layer, the faces that are on the outside are painted, and the inner faces (towards the hollow) are not.\n\nSo each small cube in the outer layer has some number of painted faces (0 to 3) and the rest are unpainted. So the total unpainted faces would be the sum of all small cube faces minus the painted ones.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Each small cube in the outer layer contributes some number of faces that are unpainted. Let's find the total number of small cube faces in the entire structure, then subtract the painted ones to get the unpainted.\n\nEach small cube has 6 faces. How many small cubes are there? As I thought before, the big cube is 5x5x5=125, and the hollow part is 3x3x3=27. So the number of small cubes is 125-27=98.\n\nSo the total number of small cube faces is 98 *6=588.\n\nBut wait, wait a minute. Wait, each small cube is on the surface, but each cube is part of the structure. So the 98 small cubes each have 6 faces, but some of those faces are on the outside (painted) and others are on the inside (unpainted, towards the hollow) or adjacent to other small cubes.\n\nBut no, the small cubes are on the surface, so their inner faces (the ones facing the hollow) are not painted. So for each small cube, the number of painted faces depends on whether they're on a face, edge, or corner.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the total number of small cube faces, subtract the painted ones (which are 150), and the remainder is the unpainted.\n\nBut wait, no, because some of the small cube's faces are adjacent to each other, so they are internal and not painted. So each face between two small cubes is internal and not painted. So the total unpainted faces would be the sum of all internal faces plus the internal faces of the hollow.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let's calculate the total number of small cube faces in the entire structure, then subtract the number of painted faces (150) and the number of internal (adjacent) faces. Because those adjacent faces are between small cubes and are not painted.\n\nBut how many internal faces are there?\n\nEach small cube in the structure (which is the outer layer) can have up to 6 faces, but some are on the surface (painted), and others are adjacent to other small cubes (unpainted) or to the hollow (unpainted).\n\nWait, maybe the number of internal faces is the sum of the number of connections between small cubes. Each connection between two small cubes represents two faces (one on each cube), but each connection is counted once.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to calculate the number of internal faces as follows. The structure is a 5x5x5 cube with a 3x3x3 hollow. The small cubes are arranged in a shell. The number of internal faces (faces between small cubes) can be calculated as the number of connections in each dimension.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of it as the entire structure (the 5x5x5 cube) has a certain number of internal faces, but since it's hollow, some of those are not present.\n\nWait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Let me think again.\n\nEach small cube in the structure (the 98) has some faces on the exterior (painted) and some faces adjacent to other small cubes or to the hollow.\n\nThe unpainted faces would be the faces that are either adjacent to another small cube (so internal, not painted) or adjacent to the hollow (so not painted either).\n\nWait, so for each small cube, the number of unpainted faces is 6 minus the number of painted faces.\n\nBut perhaps instead of dealing with each cube, we can calculate the total number of unpainted faces in the entire structure.\n\nTotal small cube faces: 98 *6=588.\n\nTotal painted faces: 6*5*5=150.\n\nSo the unpainted faces would be 588 -150=438. But wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no. Because some of the small cube's faces are adjacent to other small cubes (so internal, not painted), and others are adjacent to the hollow (unpainted). So the 588 includes all faces, including the ones that are internal between small cubes and the ones that are adjacent to the hollow.\n\nBut the 150 is the number of painted faces on the outside. So the total unpainted is 588 -150 = 438.\n\nBut wait, the options include 438 (option A). So that would be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nWait, the structure is a hollow cube with outer dimensions 5x5x5 and thickness 1 cm. So each face has a 5x5 grid of small cubes, each contributing one face to the big cube's face. So 6*25=150 painted small cube faces.\n\nThe total small cube faces are 98*6=588.\n\nSo unpainted would be 588-150=438. So the answer should be 438, which is option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the count of small cubes. Let me confirm.\n\nThe total number of small cubes in the big cube is 5^3=125.\n\nThe hollow part is 3^3=27.\n\nSo the number of small cubes is 125-27=98. Correct.\n\nEach has 6 faces, so 588. Correct.\n\nSo 588-150=438. So the answer is A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the hollow cube with outer dimensions of 5 cm on each side and a thickness of 1 cm. The cube is made up of 1 cm\u00b3 smaller cubes, and the outer surface is painted. We need to determine the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted.\n\n### Step 1: Total number of small cubes\nThe total number of small cubes in a 5 cm \u00d7 5 cm \u00d7 5 cm cube is:\n\n\\[\n5^3 = 125\n\\]\n\nSince the cube is hollow with a thickness of 1 cm, the inner hollow space is a smaller cube with dimensions:\n\n\\[\n(5 - 2 \\times 1)^3 = 3^3 = 27\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of small cubes in the outer layer (the hollow part) is:\n\n\\[\n125 - 27 = 98\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Total number of small cube faces\nEach small cube has 6 faces, so the total number of small cube faces is:\n\n\\[\n98 \\times 6 = 588\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Number of painted faces\nThe outer surface of the cube is painted. Each face of the cube is a 5 cm \u00d7 5 cm grid of small cube faces, so each face has:\n\n\\[\n5 \\times 5 = 25 \\text{ small cube faces}\n\\]\n\nThere are 6 faces on the cube, so the total number of painted small cube faces is:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 25 = 150\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Number of unpainted faces\nThe total number of unpainted faces is the total number of small cube faces minus the number of painted faces:\n\n\\[\n588 - 150 = 438\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is:\n\n**Answer: A**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a hollow cube, and I need to figure out how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted after the outer surface is painted. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the cube is hollow and has a size of 5 cm. Wait, what does that mean exactly? Oh right, I think the cube is 5 cm on each edge, so each edge is 5 cm long. But it's hollow, so it's made up of smaller cubes. The thickness is 1 cm, so the walls of the hollow cube are 1 cm thick. That makes sense because the hollow part would be 5 - 2*1 = 3 cm on each side. So the inner dimensions are 3x3x3 cm, right?\n\nThe cube is made of smaller cubes of size 1 cm. So each small cube is 1x1x1 cm. The entire structure is a 5x5x5 cube, but only the outer layer is there, and the inside is empty except for the walls.\n\nWait, no. Wait a second. The thickness is 1 cm, so the hollow part is 3 cm. So the cube is like a shell, 1 cm thick, surrounding a 3 cm hollow cube. So the total number of small cubes would be the outer shell. But perhaps that's not the main point here. The question is about painting the outer surfaces.\n\nSo when the outer surface is painted, the small cubes on the surface will have some of their faces painted. We need to find how many faces of all the small cubes remain unpainted.\n\nHmm. So each small cube can have 0 to 3 painted faces, depending on where they are. The ones on the corners have 3 painted faces, the edges have 2, the faces have 1, and the inner ones have none. But wait, in this case, the cube is hollow, so the inner part is empty. So the small cubes are only on the outer shell.\n\nWait, but the problem says it's a hollow cube, so the inside is hollow. So all the small cubes are on the surface, forming a 5x5x5 cube with a 3x3x3 hollow inside. So the number of small cubes is 5^3 - 3^3 = 125 - 27 = 98 small cubes? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 5x5x5 is 125, 3x3x3 is 27, so 125-27=98 small cubes. But wait, that's the total number of small cubes in the hollow cube.\n\nBut each small cube can contribute multiple faces to the painted surfaces. The problem is asking about the total number of faces that remain unpainted. So each small cube's faces that are not on the outside will be unpainted. But wait, the outside is painted, but the inside of the hollow part isn't.\n\nWait, no. The cube is hollow, so the inner surfaces (the ones facing the hollow) are not painted. So each small cube on the shell will have some faces painted (the ones on the outer surfaces) and some faces unpainted (the ones adjacent to the hollow or the other side of the shell).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. Each small cube is part of the hollow cube. Each cube can have up to 3 painted faces, but some will have fewer.\n\nBut the question is about the total number of faces that remain unpainted. So each small cube has 6 faces. For each small cube, the number of unpainted faces is 6 minus the number of painted faces.\n\nAlternatively, for all the small cubes, the total painted faces are those on the outer surfaces. The total number of small cube faces on the exterior is 6*(5*5) = 150, but wait, each face of the big cube is 5x5=25 squares, and there are 6 faces, so 6*25=150. But wait, each of these is a face of a small cube, so each painted face is one face of a small cube.\n\nBut wait, but some small cubes are on the edges or corners, so their faces are counted multiple times in this approach. But I think for the purpose of this problem, each painted face is counted once, as part of the outer surface.\n\nBut the problem is about the total number of faces of all small cubes that are unpainted. So the total number of small cube faces is 98 small cubes * 6 faces each = 588. Then, the number of painted faces is 150. So the unpainted faces would be 588 - 150 = 438. So the answer is 438, which is option A.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me make sure. Because some of the small cubes are on the edges, their faces are part of multiple outer surfaces. So if I count each face once, I should be okay. Because each small cube's face that's on the outside is only painted once, regardless of how many sides it's on.\n\nWait, no. Each face of the big cube is 5x5, so 25 small faces. So 6*25=150 painted small cube faces. So the total number of painted faces is 150. The total number of small cube faces is 98 * 6 = 588. So unpainted would be 588 - 150 = 438.\n\nBut wait, wait another thing. The cube is hollow, so the inner surfaces of the shell are not painted. So each small cube in the shell has some faces on the outside (painted) and some on the inside (unpainted). So the number of unpainted faces is the sum of all the inner faces of the shell.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about the inner surfaces. The inner dimensions are 3x3x3, so each inner face is 3x3. So the hollow cube's inner surfaces would have 6*(3*3) = 54 inner faces, each being a face of a small cube. So each inner face is a face of a small cube, which is unpainted. So 54 unpainted faces.\n\nBut wait, each inner face is a face of a small cube, and each small cube in the shell has some inner faces. So the total number of inner faces would be 54, but each small cube can contribute multiple inner faces.\n\nWait, but each small cube on the shell has one face on the outside and, if it's on the inner surface, one face on the inside. But wait, no, because the shell is 1 cm thick, each cube on the shell has one face on the outside, and the opposite face on the inside (the hollow part). So each such cube has one painted face and one unpainted face. But wait, no. For example, a cube on the corner of the shell has three faces on the outside (painted), and the other three faces are on the inside of the shell. But in that case, each face is either part of the outer surface (painted) or the inner surface (unpainted).\n\nWait, but the small cubes in the shell have different numbers of painted and unpainted faces. Let's break it down:\n\n- Corner cubes: 8 in total (each corner of the big cube). Each has 3 painted faces. So for each, the number of unpainted faces is 3.\n\n- Edge cubes (but not corners): Each edge of the big cube has 5 small cubes, but two are corners, so 3 per edge. So 12 edges * 3 = 36 edge cubes. Each has 2 painted faces. So each contributes 4 unpainted faces.\n\n- Face cubes (not edges or corners): Each face of the big cube has (5-2)*(5-2) = 3x3 =9 small cubes. But wait, the corners and edges are already accounted for, so each face has 9 -4 (corners) -4 (edges)=1? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, each face of the big cube is 5x5=25 small cubes. Subtract the 4 corners (each corner cube is part of the face), and the 4 edges (each edge has 5 cubes, but 2 are corners, so 3 per edge on each face). So per face, 25 -4 - (4 edges *3) = 25 -4 -12=9. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps it's better to think that each face has:\n\n- 4 corner cubes (each face has 4 corners, but each corner is shared by 3 faces). So in terms of each face, the number of cubes that are on the face but not on the edges is (5-2)^2=3^2=9.\n\nWait, no. The face has 5x5=25 cubes. The edge cubes on each face are those along the four edges. Each edge of the face has 5 cubes, but 2 are corners. So per edge, 5-2=3 non-corner edge cubes. So four edges *3 =12 non-corner edge cubes. So per face, 25 - (4 corners) - (12 edge) =9 face centers.\n\nSo each face has 9 cubes that are on the face but not on any edges. These are the center cubes of each face. Each of these has 1 painted face (the one on the outer surface) and 5 faces that are adjacent to other cubes. Wait, but since it's a hollow cube, the inner faces are all unpainted.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to calculate the total number of painted faces and subtract from the total number of faces.\n\nWait, the total number of small cubes is 5^3 - 3^3 = 125-27=98. Each cube has 6 faces, so total small cube faces = 98*6=588.\n\nThe outer surfaces of the big cube have 6 faces, each 5x5=25, so 6*25=150 painted faces.\n\nBut wait, each painted face is a face of a small cube. So the painted faces are 150. So the unpainted faces are 588-150=438. So the answer is 438, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because the hollow part has inner surfaces that are not painted, but those inner surfaces are part of the small cubes. So each small cube in the shell has some faces that are on the inner surfaces. So for each of those, the inner face is unpainted. So the total number of inner faces is 6*(3x3)=54. So 54 unpainted faces from the inner surfaces. But also, the small cubes have other faces that are adjacent to other small cubes, which are also unpainted.\n\nWait, so each small cube in the shell has:\n\n- For corner cubes: 3 painted faces (outer), 3 inner (unpainted).\n- For edge cubes: 2 painted faces, 4 inner (unpainted).\n- For face center cubes: 1 painted face, 5 inner (unpainted).\n\nWait, but wait. Each small cube in the shell is part of the outer structure. Each cube can have one face on the outside (painted) and the opposite face on the inside (unpainted). The other faces are adjacent to other small cubes, which would also be unpainted.\n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Because the shell is 1 cm thick, each small cube in the shell has one face on the outside and one face on the inside (hollow). The other four faces are connected to adjacent small cubes, which are part of the shell, so those faces are not on the outside and not on the inside. So they are between small cubes, so those faces are unpainted.\n\nSo for each small cube, the number of unpainted faces is:\n\n- 1 face on the inside (hollow, unpainted)\n- 4 faces adjacent to other small cubes (unpainted)\n- 1 face on the outside (painted)\n\nWait, no. Each cube has 6 faces. For a cube on the corner:\n\n- 3 faces are on the outside (painted)\n- 3 faces are on the inside (unpainted)\nSo unpainted: 3.\n\nFor an edge cube (not corner):\n\n- 2 painted faces on the outside\n- 4 unpainted faces (3 on the inside, 1 adjacent to another cube? Wait, perhaps not. Let me think.\n\nWait, for a cube on an edge but not a corner:\n\nIt's part of two faces of the big cube. So two of its faces are on the outside (painted). The other four faces: one is on the inner surface (hollow) and the other three are adjacent to other small cubes in the shell. So for each such cube, the unpainted faces are 4 (1 inner, 3 adjacent). Wait, that's 4.\n\nWait, but each cube has 6 faces. So painted: 2. Unpainted: 4.\n\nSimilarly, for a face center cube:\n\n- 1 painted face on the outside.\n- 5 unpainted faces: one on the inner surface, and four adjacent to other small cubes.\n\nWait, but that would be 5 unpainted faces.\n\nBut that can't be right because 1 (painted) +5 (unpainted) =6.\n\nBut then, for each small cube, the number of unpainted faces would vary depending on its position.\n\nSo perhaps instead of calculating the total painted faces, it's better to calculate the total unpainted faces by considering each small cube's position.\n\nBut that might be tedious, but perhaps manageable.\n\nLet me categorize the small cubes:\n\n1. Corner cubes: 8 in total.\n   - Each has 3 painted faces.\n   - So unpainted faces: 6-3=3.\n   - Total unpainted faces from corners: 8 *3=24.\n\n2. Edge cubes (excluding corners): Each edge has 5 small cubes, but two are corners, so 3 per edge. There are 12 edges.\n   - Each has 2 painted faces.\n   - So unpainted faces: 6-2=4.\n   - Total from edges: 12 *3 *4 = 144.\n\nWait, 12 edges, 3 cubes per edge, each with 4 unpainted faces. So 12*3=36 cubes, each contributing 4 unpainted faces. So 36 *4=144.\n\n3. Face center cubes (excluding edges): Each face has (5-2)*(5-2) = 3x3=9 small cubes. But each face has 4 edges, each contributing 3 cubes (edge non-corner), so 4*3=12. Wait, no. Each face is 5x5. Subtract the 4 corners (already counted in corners) and the 4 edges (each edge has 3 non-corner cubes, but on the face, each edge has 3 non-corner cubes, but for a single face, the edges are the 4 edges of the face, each with 3 cubes (non-corner). So 4 edges *3 =12 edge cubes on the face. So the face center cubes are 25 -4 (corners) -12 (edges) =9. So 9 per face, 6 faces, so 54 cubes.\n\nEach face center cube has 1 painted face.\nSo unpainted faces: 5.\nTotal from face centers: 54 *5=270.\n\nWait, wait, but wait. 9 face center cubes per face, 6 faces gives 54 cubes? No, that can't be. Because the total number of cubes in the shell is 98. Let's see: 8 (corners) + 36 (edges) + 54 (face centers) = 98. Yes, 8+36=44, 44+54=98. So yes.\n\nSo for each face center cube: 5 unpainted faces.\n\nWait, but wait. Each face center cube is on the face of the big cube, so one face is painted. The opposite face is on the inner surface of the shell, which is unpainted. The other four faces are adjacent to other cubes in the shell, so those are also unpainted. So 5 unpainted faces per cube.\n\nSo summing up:\n\nCorners: 8 cubes, 3 unpainted each: 24.\n\nEdges: 36 cubes, 4 each: 144.\n\nFace centers: 54 cubes,5 each: 270.\n\nTotal unpainted faces: 24 +144 +270 = 438.\n\nWhich matches the earlier calculation. So the answer is 438, option A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about a hollow cube, and I need to figure out how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted after the outer surface is painted. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the cube is hollow and has a size of 5 cm. Wait, what does that mean exactly? Oh right, I think the cube is 5 cm on each edge, so each edge is 5 cm long. But it's hollow, so it's made up of smaller cubes. The thickness is 1 cm, so the walls of the hollow cube are 1 cm thick. That makes sense because the hollow part would be 5 - 2*1 = 3 cm on each side. So the inner dimensions are 3x3x3 cm, right?\n\nThe cube is made of smaller cubes of size 1 cm. So each small cube is 1x1x1 cm. The entire structure is a 5x5x5 cube, but only the outer layer is there, and the inside is empty except for the walls.\n\nWait, no. Wait a second. The thickness is 1 cm, so the hollow part is 3 cm. So the cube is like a shell, 1 cm thick, surrounding a 3 cm hollow cube. So the total number of small cubes would be the outer shell. But perhaps that's not the main point here. The question is about painting the outer surfaces.\n\nSo when the outer surface is painted, the small cubes on the surface will have some of their faces painted. We need to find how many faces of all the small cubes remain unpainted.\n\nHmm. So each small cube can have 0 to 3 painted faces, depending on where they are. The ones on the corners have 3 painted faces, the edges have 2, the faces have 1, and the inner ones have none. But wait, in this case, the cube is hollow, so the inner part is empty. So the small cubes are only on the outer shell.\n\nWait, but the problem says it's a hollow cube, so the inside is hollow. So all the small cubes are on the surface, forming a 5x5x5 cube with a 3x3x3 hollow inside. So the number of small cubes is 5^3 - 3^3 = 125 - 27 = 98 small cubes? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 5x5x5 is 125, 3x3x3 is 27, so 125-27=98 small cubes. But wait, that's the total number of small cubes in the hollow cube.\n\nBut each small cube can contribute multiple faces to the painted surfaces. The problem is asking about the total number of faces that remain unpainted. So each small cube's faces that are not on the outside will be unpainted. But wait, the outside is painted, but the inside of the hollow part isn't.\n\nWait, no. The cube is hollow, so the inner surfaces (the ones facing the hollow) are not painted. So each small cube on the shell will have some faces painted (the ones on the outer surfaces) and some faces unpainted (the ones adjacent to the hollow or the other side of the shell).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. Each small cube is part of the hollow cube. Each cube can have up to 3 painted faces, but some will have fewer.\n\nBut the question is about the total number of faces that remain unpainted. So each small cube has 6 faces. For each small cube, the number of unpainted faces is 6 minus the number of painted faces.\n\nAlternatively, for all the small cubes, the total painted faces are those on the outer surfaces. The total number of small cube faces on the exterior is 6*(5*5) = 150, but wait, each face of the big cube is 5x5=25 squares, and there are 6 faces, so 6*25=150. But wait, each of these is a face of a small cube, so each painted face is one face of a small cube.\n\nBut wait, but some small cubes are on the edges or corners, so their faces are counted multiple times in this approach. But I think for the purpose of this problem, each painted face is counted once, as part of the outer surface.\n\nBut the problem is about the total number of faces of all small cubes that are unpainted. So the total number of small cube faces is 98 small cubes * 6 faces each = 588. Then, the number of painted faces is 150. So the unpainted faces would be 588 - 150 = 438. So the answer is 438, which is option A.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me make sure. Because some of the small cubes are on the edges, their faces are part of multiple outer surfaces. So if I count each face once, I should be okay. Because each small cube's face that's on the outside is only painted once, regardless of how many sides it's on.\n\nWait, no. Each face of the big cube is 5x5, so 25 small faces. So 6*25=150 painted small cube faces. So the total number of painted faces is 150. The total number of small cube faces is 98 * 6 = 588. So unpainted would be 588 - 150 = 438.\n\nBut wait, wait another thing. The cube is hollow, so the inner surfaces of the shell are not painted. So each small cube in the shell has some faces on the outside (painted) and some on the inside (unpainted). So the number of unpainted faces is the sum of all the inner faces of the shell.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about the inner surfaces. The inner dimensions are 3x3x3, so each inner face is 3x3. So the hollow cube's inner surfaces would have 6*(3*3) = 54 inner faces, each being a face of a small cube. So each inner face is a face of a small cube, which is unpainted. So 54 unpainted faces.\n\nBut wait, each inner face is a face of a small cube, and each small cube in the shell has some inner faces. So the total number of inner faces would be 54, but each small cube can contribute multiple inner faces.\n\nWait, but each small cube on the shell has one face on the outside and, if it's on the inner surface, one face on the inside. But wait, no, because the shell is 1 cm thick, each cube on the shell has one face on the outside, and the opposite face on the inside (the hollow part). So each such cube has one painted face and one unpainted face. But wait, no. For example, a cube on the corner of the shell has three faces on the outside (painted), and the other three faces are on the inside of the shell. But in that case, each face is either part of the outer surface (painted) or the inner surface (unpainted).\n\nWait, but the small cubes in the shell have different numbers of painted and unpainted faces. Let's break it down:\n\n- Corner cubes: 8 in total (each corner of the big cube). Each has 3 painted faces. So for each, the number of unpainted faces is 3.\n\n- Edge cubes (but not corners): Each edge of the big cube has 5 small cubes, but two are corners, so 3 per edge. So 12 edges * 3 = 36 edge cubes. Each has 2 painted faces. So each contributes 4 unpainted faces.\n\n- Face cubes (not edges or corners): Each face of the big cube has (5-2)*(5-2) = 3x3 =9 small cubes. But wait, the corners and edges are already accounted for, so each face has 9 -4 (corners) -4 (edges)=1? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, each face of the big cube is 5x5=25 small cubes. Subtract the 4 corners (each corner cube is part of the face), and the 4 edges (each edge has 5 cubes, but 2 are corners, so 3 per edge on each face). So per face, 25 -4 - (4 edges *3) = 25 -4 -12=9. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps it's better to think that each face has:\n\n- 4 corner cubes (each face has 4 corners, but each corner is shared by 3 faces). So in terms of each face, the number of cubes that are on the face but not on the edges is (5-2)^2=3^2=9.\n\nWait, no. The face has 5x5=25 cubes. The edge cubes on each face are those along the four edges. Each edge of the face has 5 cubes, but 2 are corners. So per edge, 5-2=3 non-corner edge cubes. So four edges *3 =12 non-corner edge cubes. So per face, 25 - (4 corners) - (12 edge) =9 face centers.\n\nSo each face has 9 cubes that are on the face but not on any edges. These are the center cubes of each face. Each of these has 1 painted face (the one on the outer surface) and 5 faces that are adjacent to other cubes. Wait, but since it's a hollow cube, the inner faces are all unpainted.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to calculate the total number of painted faces and subtract from the total number of faces.\n\nWait, the total number of small cubes is 5^3 - 3^3 = 125-27=98. Each cube has 6 faces, so total small cube faces = 98*6=588.\n\nThe outer surfaces of the big cube have 6 faces, each 5x5=25, so 6*25=150 painted faces.\n\nBut wait, each painted face is a face of a small cube. So the painted faces are 150. So the unpainted faces are 588-150=438. So the answer is 438, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because the hollow part has inner surfaces that are not painted, but those inner surfaces are part of the small cubes. So each small cube in the shell has some faces that are on the inner surfaces. So for each of those, the inner face is unpainted. So the total number of inner faces is 6*(3x3)=54. So 54 unpainted faces from the inner surfaces. But also, the small cubes have other faces that are adjacent to other small cubes, which are also unpainted.\n\nWait, so each small cube in the shell has:\n\n- For corner cubes: 3 painted faces (outer), 3 inner (unpainted).\n- For edge cubes: 2 painted faces, 4 inner (unpainted).\n- For face center cubes: 1 painted face, 5 inner (unpainted).\n\nWait, but wait. Each small cube in the shell is part of the outer structure. Each cube can have one face on the outside (painted) and the opposite face on the inside (unpainted). The other faces are adjacent to other small cubes, which would also be unpainted.\n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Because the shell is 1 cm thick, each small cube in the shell has one face on the outside and one face on the inside (hollow). The other four faces are connected to adjacent small cubes, which are part of the shell, so those faces are not on the outside and not on the inside. So they are between small cubes, so those faces are unpainted.\n\nSo for each small cube, the number of unpainted faces is:\n\n- 1 face on the inside (hollow, unpainted)\n- 4 faces adjacent to other small cubes (unpainted)\n- 1 face on the outside (painted)\n\nWait, no. Each cube has 6 faces. For a cube on the corner:\n\n- 3 faces are on the outside (painted)\n- 3 faces are on the inside (unpainted)\nSo unpainted: 3.\n\nFor an edge cube (not corner):\n\n- 2 painted faces on the outside\n- 4 unpainted faces (3 on the inside, 1 adjacent to another cube? Wait, perhaps not. Let me think.\n\nWait, for a cube on an edge but not a corner:\n\nIt's part of two faces of the big cube. So two of its faces are on the outside (painted). The other four faces: one is on the inner surface (hollow) and the other three are adjacent to other small cubes in the shell. So for each such cube, the unpainted faces are 4 (1 inner, 3 adjacent). Wait, that's 4.\n\nWait, but each cube has 6 faces. So painted: 2. Unpainted: 4.\n\nSimilarly, for a face center cube:\n\n- 1 painted face on the outside.\n- 5 unpainted faces: one on the inner surface, and four adjacent to other small cubes.\n\nWait, but that would be 5 unpainted faces.\n\nBut that can't be right because 1 (painted) +5 (unpainted) =6.\n\nBut then, for each small cube, the number of unpainted faces would vary depending on its position.\n\nSo perhaps instead of calculating the total painted faces, it's better to calculate the total unpainted faces by considering each small cube's position.\n\nBut that might be tedious, but perhaps manageable.\n\nLet me categorize the small cubes:\n\n1. Corner cubes: 8 in total.\n   - Each has 3 painted faces.\n   - So unpainted faces: 6-3=3.\n   - Total unpainted faces from corners: 8 *3=24.\n\n2. Edge cubes (excluding corners): Each edge has 5 small cubes, but two are corners, so 3 per edge. There are 12 edges.\n   - Each has 2 painted faces.\n   - So unpainted faces: 6-2=4.\n   - Total from edges: 12 *3 *4 = 144.\n\nWait, 12 edges, 3 cubes per edge, each with 4 unpainted faces. So 12*3=36 cubes, each contributing 4 unpainted faces. So 36 *4=144.\n\n3. Face center cubes (excluding edges): Each face has (5-2)*(5-2) = 3x3=9 small cubes. But each face has 4 edges, each contributing 3 cubes (edge non-corner), so 4*3=12. Wait, no. Each face is 5x5. Subtract the 4 corners (already counted in corners) and the 4 edges (each edge has 3 non-corner cubes, but on the face, each edge has 3 non-corner cubes, but for a single face, the edges are the 4 edges of the face, each with 3 cubes (non-corner). So 4 edges *3 =12 edge cubes on the face. So the face center cubes are 25 -4 (corners) -12 (edges) =9. So 9 per face, 6 faces, so 54 cubes.\n\nEach face center cube has 1 painted face.\nSo unpainted faces: 5.\nTotal from face centers: 54 *5=270.\n\nWait, wait, but wait. 9 face center cubes per face, 6 faces gives 54 cubes? No, that can't be. Because the total number of cubes in the shell is 98. Let's see: 8 (corners) + 36 (edges) + 54 (face centers) = 98. Yes, 8+36=44, 44+54=98. So yes.\n\nSo for each face center cube: 5 unpainted faces.\n\nWait, but wait. Each face center cube is on the face of the big cube, so one face is painted. The opposite face is on the inner surface of the shell, which is unpainted. The other four faces are adjacent to other cubes in the shell, so those are also unpainted. So 5 unpainted faces per cube.\n\nSo summing up:\n\nCorners: 8 cubes, 3 unpainted each: 24.\n\nEdges: 36 cubes, 4 each: 144.\n\nFace centers: 54 cubes,5 each: 270.\n\nTotal unpainted faces: 24 +144 +270 = 438.\n\nWhich matches the earlier calculation. So the answer is 438, option A.\n\n\nTo determine how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted, we analyze the hollow cube structure. The hollow cube has an outer dimension of 5 cm on each side and a thickness of 1 cm, making the inner hollow dimensions 3 cm on each side. The cube is composed of smaller 1 cm cubes, and the total number of small cubes in the hollow structure is:\n\n\\[\n5^3 - 3^3 = 125 - 27 = 98 \\, \\text{small cubes}.\n\\]\n\nEach small cube has 6 faces, so the total number of faces across all small cubes is:\n\n\\[\n98 \\times 6 = 588 \\, \\text{faces}.\n\\]\n\nThe outer surface of the hollow cube is painted. Each face of the hollow cube is a 5 cm \u00d7 5 cm square, which contains \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\) small cube faces. Since there are 6 faces on the hollow cube, the total number of painted faces is:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 25 = 150 \\, \\text{painted faces}.\n\\]\n\nThe total number of unpainted faces is the difference between the total faces and the painted faces:\n\n\\[\n588 - 150 = 438 \\, \\text{unpainted faces}.\n\\]\n\nThis result can also be verified by categorizing the small cubes based on their positions in the hollow cube:\n\n1. **Corner cubes (8 cubes):** Each corner cube has 3 painted faces and 3 unpainted faces. Total unpainted faces from corners:\n   \\[\n   8 \\times 3 = 24.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Edge cubes (excluding corners, 36 cubes):** Each edge cube has 2 painted faces and 4 unpainted faces. Total unpainted faces from edges:\n   \\[\n   36 \\times 4 = 144.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Face center cubes (54 cubes):** Each face center cube has 1 painted face and 5 unpainted faces. Total unpainted faces from face centers:\n   \\[\n   54 \\times 5 = 270.\n   \\]\n\nSumming these contributions:\n\n\\[\n24 + 144 + 270 = 438 \\, \\text{unpainted faces}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of unpainted faces of the smaller cubes is **438**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a hollow cube, and I need to figure out how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted after the outer surface is painted. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the cube is 5 cm in size, but it's hollow with a thickness of 1 cm. That means the cube isn't solid; it's like a box with walls that are 1 cm thick. So the cube is made up of smaller cubes that are 1 cm in size each. Wait, the size of the hollow cube is 5 cm, so each edge is 5 cm long. But since it's hollow, the inside is empty except for the walls.\n\nLet me visualize this. The cube has dimensions 5x5x5 cm. Each small cube is 1 cm, so the entire cube is made of 5*5*5 = 125 small cubes. But because it's hollow, the inner part is empty. Wait, no. Wait, the cube's thickness is 1 cm, so the hollow part is a 3x3x3 cube inside. Because 5 cm minus 2 times the thickness (1 cm on each side) equals 3 cm. So the inner hollow space is 3 cm on each edge. So the number of small cubes that are part of the structure is the total cubes minus the inner hollow. That would be 5^3 - 3^3 = 125 - 27 = 98 small cubes. Oh wait, but the problem says it's made of smaller cubes of size 1 cm, so maybe all the outer layers are present, and the inside is empty. So the structure has 5x5x5 cubes, but the inside 3x3x3 is missing.\n\nBut the question is about the outer surface being painted. So the outer surfaces are painted, and we need to find how many faces of the small cubes remain unpainted. So for each small cube, some of its faces are on the outside and get painted. The ones that are inside don't get painted. Wait, but the cube is hollow, so the inner small cubes (those in the 3x3x3) are actually not part of the structure. So the problem is about the small cubes that are present in the hollow cube. So each of these cubes is either on the surface or inside the structure.\n\nWait, but the hollow cube is 5 cm in size, with a thickness of 1 cm. So the outer shell is 1 cm thick. So the inner dimensions would be 3x3x3 cm. So the structure is like a 5x5x5 cube minus a 3x3x3 cube. So the number of small cubes is 5^3 - 3^3 = 125-27=98. So there are 98 small cubes in the hollow cube.\n\nEach of these 98 cubes is part of the structure. Now, the outer surfaces are painted. So any face of these small cubes that's on the outer surface gets painted. The question is about how many faces of the small cubes remain unpainted.\n\nWait, but each small cube can have multiple faces. For example, a corner cube has three faces exposed, an edge cube (but not corner) has two, a face cube (not edge) has one, and an internal cube (but in this case, there are no internal cubes because the hollow is 3x3x3, and the structure is 1 cm thick). Wait, no: the structure is 5x5x5, but the hollow is 3x3x3. So the outer 1 cm is the structure. So each small cube in the structure is on the outer surface, but some have more exposed faces.\n\nWait, no. No, that's not right. The small cubes on the corners of the structure (the 5x5x5 cube) have three faces exposed. The ones on the edges (but not corners) have two faces exposed. The ones on the faces (but not edges) have one face exposed. And the ones in the inner part of the structure (if any) would have zero faces exposed. But in this case, the structure is only 1 cm thick, so the inner part is the hollow. So all the small cubes in the structure are on the outer surfaces. So each of these 98 small cubes is part of the outer shell, meaning all of their faces that are on the exterior are painted.\n\nWait, no, wait. The hollow cube is 5 cm in size, so each edge is 5 cm. The thickness is 1 cm, so the hollow part is 3x3x3. So the structure is 5x5x5 minus 3x3x3, which is 98 cubes. These 98 cubes form the outer shell of the cube.\n\nEach of these 98 cubes is on the outer surface of the hollow cube. So, each of their faces that are on the exterior of the hollow cube will be painted. The other faces (the ones pointing inward) might be adjacent to the hollow or other structure cubes. So, for each small cube in the structure, any face that's on the outside of the hollow cube is painted, and the ones pointing inward are either adjacent to another structure cube or the hollow.\n\nBut the question is about the total number of faces of the small cubes that remain unpainted. So for each small cube, how many of their faces are not painted.\n\nLet me think about a single small cube in the structure. Let's take a cube in the middle of a face. So, for example, on the front face of the hollow cube, a cube that's not on an edge or corner. This cube has one face on the front (painted), and the other five faces: four adjacent to other structure cubes (so they are internal and not painted), and one face pointing into the hollow (which is not painted). Wait, wait, but the hollow is empty, so the face pointing into the hollow is not painted because it's the inner side of the structure. So for this cube, only one face is painted; the other five are unpainted.\n\nWait, but the structure is only 1 cm thick. So each cube in the structure is either on the outer surface (so one of their faces is on the exterior, painted), and the opposite face is pointing into the hollow, which isn't painted. The other four faces (the ones adjacent to other structure cubes) are not on the exterior, so they are either adjacent to another structure cube or the hollow.\n\nWait, no. Let's think about a cube in the structure. For a cube on the face but not on an edge or corner: it has one face on the exterior (painted), and the opposite face is on the interior (unpainted). The four other faces are adjacent to other structure cubes, so they are internal and not painted. So for this cube, 5 faces are unpainted, and 1 is painted.\n\nWait, but each small cube has 6 faces. So for this cube, 1 painted, 5 unpainted.\n\nSimilarly, for a cube on an edge but not a corner: it's part of two faces of the hollow cube. So two of its faces are painted, and the other four: two are adjacent to other structure cubes, one is on the interior, and one is adjacent to another structure cube. Wait, no. Let me imagine a cube on the edge but not a corner. It's in the middle of an edge. So it's on two faces of the hollow cube, so two of its faces are painted. The other four faces: two are adjacent to other structure cubes (so not painted), and the other two are: one pointing into the hollow (unpainted) and the other adjacent to another structure cube (unpainted). So for this cube, 2 painted, 4 unpainted.\n\nWait, but the structure is 1 cm thick. So for any cube on the edge, it's only part of two faces, each 5x5. So two faces painted.\n\nFor a corner cube: three faces painted. The other three faces: two are adjacent to structure cubes, and one points into the hollow. So 3 painted, 3 unpainted.\n\nSo each cube in the structure contributes a certain number of unpainted faces, depending on its position.\n\nSo the total unpainted faces would be the sum for all 98 structure cubes of the number of unpainted faces per cube.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the total number of faces of all small cubes, subtract the number of painted faces.\n\nEach small cube has 6 faces. There are 98 small cubes, so total faces = 98 * 6 = 588.\n\nNow, how many of these are painted? The painted faces are all the outer faces of the hollow cube.\n\nThe hollow cube has 6 faces, each of size 5x5 cm. Each face is a 5x5 grid of small cubes, so each face has 25 small cube faces. So the total painted faces are 6 * 25 = 150.\n\nBut wait, each small cube on the edge or corner is shared between multiple faces. However, when we calculate the number of painted faces, it's simply the sum of all the outer faces, which are 6 * 25 = 150. Because each of these is a separate face on a small cube.\n\nSo the total painted faces are 150. Thus, the unpainted faces are total faces (588) minus painted faces (150) = 438.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me verify.\n\nTotal small cubes: 5^3 - 3^3 = 125-27=98.\n\nEach has 6 faces: 98 *6=588.\n\nPainted faces: 6 faces of the cube, each 5x5 cm, so 6*25=150.\n\nUnpainted faces: 588-150=438.\n\nSo the answer would be 438, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if I'm considering the inner faces correctly. The hollow part has 3x3x3=27 small cubes. Wait, no, the hollow is empty, so there are no small cubes there. So the 98 small cubes are all in the outer shell. So their faces that point inward are not painted. But how many of those are there?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the inner faces of the structure are not painted because they're inside the hollow. So for each small cube in the structure, the faces that are pointing inward (towards the hollow) are not painted. How many such inner faces are there?\n\nWait, the structure is 5x5x5, with a hollow 3x3x3 inside. The inner surface of the structure is 3x3x3 in dimensions, so the inner faces would be 6*(3*3)=54. But wait, that's the total inner surface area. But each inner face is a face of a small cube. So the inner faces of the structure are 54 in total.\n\nBut each inner face belongs to a small cube in the structure. So each of these 54 inner faces is a face of a small cube that is unpainted because it's on the inside of the structure.\n\nSo the number of unpainted faces would be the number of inner faces plus the number of faces of the structure cubes that are adjacent to other structure cubes.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: each structure cube has some faces painted and some not. The painted faces are those on the exterior (each of the 6 cube faces), and the unpainted are the others.\n\nBut according to the initial approach, the total unpainted faces are 588-150=438. That would be option A.\n\nBut wait, let's think again. The structure is 5x5x5, so each face has 25 small cube faces. So 6*25=150 painted.\n\nEach structure cube is part of the outer shell, so each contributes some painted faces. But the question is about the number of faces of the small cubes that remain unpainted. So perhaps the inner faces (facing the hollow) plus the faces between structure cubes are the unpainted ones.\n\nAlternatively, the total unpainted faces would be the sum of all the internal faces of the structure (the faces between structure cubes) plus the inner faces (facing the hollow).\n\nBut how many internal faces are there?\n\nIn a cube, the internal faces are the ones that are between the structure cubes. Each internal face is shared between two structure cubes, so we have to count them once.\n\nThe structure is a 5x5x5 cube minus a 3x3x3 hollow. So the structure is a 1 cm thick shell. So the number of internal faces can be calculated.\n\nWait, each face of the structure (excluding the outer surfaces) has (5-2)*(5-2)=3x3=9 cubes per face. Because the structure is 1 cm thick, each face has a 3x3 grid of inner faces.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way: the structure is a 5x5x5 cube. The inner hollow is a 3x3x3. The internal faces of the structure would be the faces that are part of the hollow. So the hollow has 6 faces, each 3x3, so 6*(3*3)=54. But each of these is a face of a structure cube. So these 54 faces are the ones facing the hollow and are unpainted.\n\nAdditionally, the structure cubes have faces that are adjacent to other structure cubes. Each such face is shared between two structure cubes, so each contributes to two faces (each cube has one face, but they are the same face). So the number of internal structure faces is the total number of faces in the structure minus the external (painted) faces minus the inner (facing hollow) faces.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: the number of internal faces between structure cubes is equal to the number of connections between structure cubes. For a cube, each edge has (n-2) connections in a 5x5x5 cube. Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of faces in the structure cubes is 98 *6 = 588.\n\nOf these, 150 are painted. So 588-150=438 unpainted. But some of these unpainted faces are the inner faces (facing the hollow), and others are the internal faces (facing other structure cubes).\n\nSo the total unpainted faces are 438, which would be the sum of the inner faces (54) and the internal structure faces (the ones between structure cubes).\n\nBut wait, according to this, the answer is 438. So option A is the correct answer.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a hollow cube, and I need to figure out how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted after the outer surface is painted. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the cube is 5 cm in size, but it's hollow with a thickness of 1 cm. That means the cube isn't solid; it's like a box with walls that are 1 cm thick. So the cube is made up of smaller cubes that are 1 cm in size each. Wait, the size of the hollow cube is 5 cm, so each edge is 5 cm long. But since it's hollow, the inside is empty except for the walls.\n\nLet me visualize this. The cube has dimensions 5x5x5 cm. Each small cube is 1 cm, so the entire cube is made of 5*5*5 = 125 small cubes. But because it's hollow, the inner part is empty. Wait, no. Wait, the cube's thickness is 1 cm, so the hollow part is a 3x3x3 cube inside. Because 5 cm minus 2 times the thickness (1 cm on each side) equals 3 cm. So the inner hollow space is 3 cm on each edge. So the number of small cubes that are part of the structure is the total cubes minus the inner hollow. That would be 5^3 - 3^3 = 125 - 27 = 98 small cubes. Oh wait, but the problem says it's made of smaller cubes of size 1 cm, so maybe all the outer layers are present, and the inside is empty. So the structure has 5x5x5 cubes, but the inside 3x3x3 is missing.\n\nBut the question is about the outer surface being painted. So the outer surfaces are painted, and we need to find how many faces of the small cubes remain unpainted. So for each small cube, some of its faces are on the outside and get painted. The ones that are inside don't get painted. Wait, but the cube is hollow, so the inner small cubes (those in the 3x3x3) are actually not part of the structure. So the problem is about the small cubes that are present in the hollow cube. So each of these cubes is either on the surface or inside the structure.\n\nWait, but the hollow cube is 5 cm in size, with a thickness of 1 cm. So the outer shell is 1 cm thick. So the inner dimensions would be 3x3x3 cm. So the structure is like a 5x5x5 cube minus a 3x3x3 cube. So the number of small cubes is 5^3 - 3^3 = 125-27=98. So there are 98 small cubes in the hollow cube.\n\nEach of these 98 cubes is part of the structure. Now, the outer surfaces are painted. So any face of these small cubes that's on the outer surface gets painted. The question is about how many faces of the small cubes remain unpainted.\n\nWait, but each small cube can have multiple faces. For example, a corner cube has three faces exposed, an edge cube (but not corner) has two, a face cube (not edge) has one, and an internal cube (but in this case, there are no internal cubes because the hollow is 3x3x3, and the structure is 1 cm thick). Wait, no: the structure is 5x5x5, but the hollow is 3x3x3. So the outer 1 cm is the structure. So each small cube in the structure is on the outer surface, but some have more exposed faces.\n\nWait, no. No, that's not right. The small cubes on the corners of the structure (the 5x5x5 cube) have three faces exposed. The ones on the edges (but not corners) have two faces exposed. The ones on the faces (but not edges) have one face exposed. And the ones in the inner part of the structure (if any) would have zero faces exposed. But in this case, the structure is only 1 cm thick, so the inner part is the hollow. So all the small cubes in the structure are on the outer surfaces. So each of these 98 small cubes is part of the outer shell, meaning all of their faces that are on the exterior are painted.\n\nWait, no, wait. The hollow cube is 5 cm in size, so each edge is 5 cm. The thickness is 1 cm, so the hollow part is 3x3x3. So the structure is 5x5x5 minus 3x3x3, which is 98 cubes. These 98 cubes form the outer shell of the cube.\n\nEach of these 98 cubes is on the outer surface of the hollow cube. So, each of their faces that are on the exterior of the hollow cube will be painted. The other faces (the ones pointing inward) might be adjacent to the hollow or other structure cubes. So, for each small cube in the structure, any face that's on the outside of the hollow cube is painted, and the ones pointing inward are either adjacent to another structure cube or the hollow.\n\nBut the question is about the total number of faces of the small cubes that remain unpainted. So for each small cube, how many of their faces are not painted.\n\nLet me think about a single small cube in the structure. Let's take a cube in the middle of a face. So, for example, on the front face of the hollow cube, a cube that's not on an edge or corner. This cube has one face on the front (painted), and the other five faces: four adjacent to other structure cubes (so they are internal and not painted), and one face pointing into the hollow (which is not painted). Wait, wait, but the hollow is empty, so the face pointing into the hollow is not painted because it's the inner side of the structure. So for this cube, only one face is painted; the other five are unpainted.\n\nWait, but the structure is only 1 cm thick. So each cube in the structure is either on the outer surface (so one of their faces is on the exterior, painted), and the opposite face is pointing into the hollow, which isn't painted. The other four faces (the ones adjacent to other structure cubes) are not on the exterior, so they are either adjacent to another structure cube or the hollow.\n\nWait, no. Let's think about a cube in the structure. For a cube on the face but not on an edge or corner: it has one face on the exterior (painted), and the opposite face is on the interior (unpainted). The four other faces are adjacent to other structure cubes, so they are internal and not painted. So for this cube, 5 faces are unpainted, and 1 is painted.\n\nWait, but each small cube has 6 faces. So for this cube, 1 painted, 5 unpainted.\n\nSimilarly, for a cube on an edge but not a corner: it's part of two faces of the hollow cube. So two of its faces are painted, and the other four: two are adjacent to other structure cubes, one is on the interior, and one is adjacent to another structure cube. Wait, no. Let me imagine a cube on the edge but not a corner. It's in the middle of an edge. So it's on two faces of the hollow cube, so two of its faces are painted. The other four faces: two are adjacent to other structure cubes (so not painted), and the other two are: one pointing into the hollow (unpainted) and the other adjacent to another structure cube (unpainted). So for this cube, 2 painted, 4 unpainted.\n\nWait, but the structure is 1 cm thick. So for any cube on the edge, it's only part of two faces, each 5x5. So two faces painted.\n\nFor a corner cube: three faces painted. The other three faces: two are adjacent to structure cubes, and one points into the hollow. So 3 painted, 3 unpainted.\n\nSo each cube in the structure contributes a certain number of unpainted faces, depending on its position.\n\nSo the total unpainted faces would be the sum for all 98 structure cubes of the number of unpainted faces per cube.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the total number of faces of all small cubes, subtract the number of painted faces.\n\nEach small cube has 6 faces. There are 98 small cubes, so total faces = 98 * 6 = 588.\n\nNow, how many of these are painted? The painted faces are all the outer faces of the hollow cube.\n\nThe hollow cube has 6 faces, each of size 5x5 cm. Each face is a 5x5 grid of small cubes, so each face has 25 small cube faces. So the total painted faces are 6 * 25 = 150.\n\nBut wait, each small cube on the edge or corner is shared between multiple faces. However, when we calculate the number of painted faces, it's simply the sum of all the outer faces, which are 6 * 25 = 150. Because each of these is a separate face on a small cube.\n\nSo the total painted faces are 150. Thus, the unpainted faces are total faces (588) minus painted faces (150) = 438.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me verify.\n\nTotal small cubes: 5^3 - 3^3 = 125-27=98.\n\nEach has 6 faces: 98 *6=588.\n\nPainted faces: 6 faces of the cube, each 5x5 cm, so 6*25=150.\n\nUnpainted faces: 588-150=438.\n\nSo the answer would be 438, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if I'm considering the inner faces correctly. The hollow part has 3x3x3=27 small cubes. Wait, no, the hollow is empty, so there are no small cubes there. So the 98 small cubes are all in the outer shell. So their faces that point inward are not painted. But how many of those are there?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the inner faces of the structure are not painted because they're inside the hollow. So for each small cube in the structure, the faces that are pointing inward (towards the hollow) are not painted. How many such inner faces are there?\n\nWait, the structure is 5x5x5, with a hollow 3x3x3 inside. The inner surface of the structure is 3x3x3 in dimensions, so the inner faces would be 6*(3*3)=54. But wait, that's the total inner surface area. But each inner face is a face of a small cube. So the inner faces of the structure are 54 in total.\n\nBut each inner face belongs to a small cube in the structure. So each of these 54 inner faces is a face of a small cube that is unpainted because it's on the inside of the structure.\n\nSo the number of unpainted faces would be the number of inner faces plus the number of faces of the structure cubes that are adjacent to other structure cubes.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: each structure cube has some faces painted and some not. The painted faces are those on the exterior (each of the 6 cube faces), and the unpainted are the others.\n\nBut according to the initial approach, the total unpainted faces are 588-150=438. That would be option A.\n\nBut wait, let's think again. The structure is 5x5x5, so each face has 25 small cube faces. So 6*25=150 painted.\n\nEach structure cube is part of the outer shell, so each contributes some painted faces. But the question is about the number of faces of the small cubes that remain unpainted. So perhaps the inner faces (facing the hollow) plus the faces between structure cubes are the unpainted ones.\n\nAlternatively, the total unpainted faces would be the sum of all the internal faces of the structure (the faces between structure cubes) plus the inner faces (facing the hollow).\n\nBut how many internal faces are there?\n\nIn a cube, the internal faces are the ones that are between the structure cubes. Each internal face is shared between two structure cubes, so we have to count them once.\n\nThe structure is a 5x5x5 cube minus a 3x3x3 hollow. So the structure is a 1 cm thick shell. So the number of internal faces can be calculated.\n\nWait, each face of the structure (excluding the outer surfaces) has (5-2)*(5-2)=3x3=9 cubes per face. Because the structure is 1 cm thick, each face has a 3x3 grid of inner faces.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way: the structure is a 5x5x5 cube. The inner hollow is a 3x3x3. The internal faces of the structure would be the faces that are part of the hollow. So the hollow has 6 faces, each 3x3, so 6*(3*3)=54. But each of these is a face of a structure cube. So these 54 faces are the ones facing the hollow and are unpainted.\n\nAdditionally, the structure cubes have faces that are adjacent to other structure cubes. Each such face is shared between two structure cubes, so each contributes to two faces (each cube has one face, but they are the same face). So the number of internal structure faces is the total number of faces in the structure minus the external (painted) faces minus the inner (facing hollow) faces.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: the number of internal faces between structure cubes is equal to the number of connections between structure cubes. For a cube, each edge has (n-2) connections in a 5x5x5 cube. Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of faces in the structure cubes is 98 *6 = 588.\n\nOf these, 150 are painted. So 588-150=438 unpainted. But some of these unpainted faces are the inner faces (facing the hollow), and others are the internal faces (facing other structure cubes).\n\nSo the total unpainted faces are 438, which would be the sum of the inner faces (54) and the internal structure faces (the ones between structure cubes).\n\nBut wait, according to this, the answer is 438. So option A is the correct answer.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the hollow cube of size 5 cm (edge length) with a thickness of 1 cm. The cube is made up of smaller cubes of size 1 cm. The hollow part of the cube has an inner dimension of 3 cm (edge length), as the thickness of 1 cm is subtracted from both sides of each dimension.\n\n### Step 1: Total number of small cubes\nThe total number of small cubes in the hollow cube is calculated as:\n\\[\n5^3 - 3^3 = 125 - 27 = 98\n\\]\nThus, there are 98 small cubes in the structure.\n\n### Step 2: Total number of faces\nEach small cube has 6 faces, so the total number of faces for all 98 cubes is:\n\\[\n98 \\times 6 = 588\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Number of painted faces\nThe outer surface of the hollow cube is painted.

Therefore, the total number of painted faces is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 25 = 150\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Number of unpainted faces\nThe total number of unpainted faces is the difference between the total faces and the painted faces:\n\\[\n588 - 150 = 438\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is **438**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a hollow cube, and I need to figure out how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted after the outer surface is painted. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, the cube is hollow, size 5cm, with each side 5cm. The thickness is 1cm, so I guess that means the walls of the cube are 1cm thick, right? And it's made up of smaller cubes that are 1cm each. So each small cube is 1x1x1 cm. \n\nFirst, I need to visualize this. A hollow cube would have a sort of shell structure. The outer layer is 1cm thick, so the inner part is empty except for maybe some inner walls? Or wait, no, since it's hollow, the inside is just empty space. So the cube is like a box made of small cubes.\n\nWait, the cube's size is 5cm, so each edge is 5cm. So the total number of small cubes in the entire structure would be 5x5x5, which is 125. But since it's hollow, the inner part is missing. The hollow part would be a cube of size 3cm, because the thickness is 1cm, so subtracting 2cm from each dimension (1cm from each side). So the inner hollow space is 3x3x3, which is 27 small cubes. So the total number of small cubes in the structure is 125 - 27 = 98. Wait, but wait a minute, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Because when the cube is hollow with thickness 1cm, it's only the outer layer that's present, and the inner is empty. So the actual structure is the outer shell, which is the 5x5x5 cube minus the 3x3x3 inner cube. So yeah, 98 small cubes in the hollow cube.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the faces of the small cubes that are unpainted. The outer surface is painted, so all the outer small cubes have their outer faces painted. But the question is about the total number of faces of all small cubes that remain unpainted.\n\nSo each small cube can have up to 6 faces. But some are on the inside, not exposed, so those faces would be unpainted.\n\nWait, but the cube is hollow, so the inner part is empty. So the inner surfaces of the cube's walls are not painted. So for the small cubes on the outer layer, their outer faces are painted, but the inner faces (facing the hollow) might not be painted. But wait, the painting is only on the outer surface. So the inner faces of the hollow cube are not painted.\n\nSo, the problem is to find the total number of faces of all small cubes that are unpainted.\n\nEach small cube in the hollow cube can have some faces unpainted. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of small cubes. As calculated, 5x5x5 is 125. Subtract the inner 3x3x3=27, so 98 small cubes.\n\nEach small cube has 6 faces. So the total number of faces is 98 *6 = 588.\n\nBut some of these faces are on the exterior, which are painted, and others are internal (unpainted). The question is to find the number of unpainted faces.\n\nSo, the total number of painted faces is the number of small cube faces on the outside of the hollow cube.\n\nThe hollow cube is a 5x5x5 cube. The outer surface has 6 faces, each of size 5x5, so 6*25=150 faces. But wait, each of these is a face of a small cube, right? So 150 small cube faces are painted.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The hollow cube's inner surfaces are the ones that are 3x3x3, but those are empty. So the inner surfaces of the hollow cube's walls are not part of the structure. So, the faces that are on the inner side of the hollow cube's walls are not painted, but are they part of the small cubes?\n\nNo, because those are the inner surfaces. The hollow cube's walls are 1cm thick, so each face of the hollow cube has a 5x5 area, but the inner part is 3x3. So for each face, the outer 5x5 is the painted area, and the inner 3x3 is the hollow. But wait, the inner 3x3 is not part of the structure, so the small cubes are only on the outer layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that the hollow cube's structure is a 5x5x5 cube with a 3x3x3 cube removed. So the small cubes are the ones that are in the outer shell. So each face of the hollow cube is a 5x5 area, but the small cubes on that face are the ones that are on the outer layer.\n\nWait, so each face of the hollow cube has 5x5=25 small cube faces, which are painted. So 6 faces, 25 each: 6*25=150 painted small cube faces.\n\nSo, the total number of painted faces is 150. So the total unpainted faces would be total faces of all small cubes (588) minus painted faces (150) = 438.\n\nWait, that's one of the options. Option A is 438. So that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Are there any other faces that are unpainted besides the inner faces? Because the small cubes on the edges and corners have multiple faces exposed, but perhaps some internal faces between small cubes are also unpainted.\n\nWait, the small cubes in the hollow cube have their outer faces painted, but their inner faces (facing the hollow) are not painted. Also, the faces that are adjacent to other small cubes are not painted, because they are internal to the structure.\n\nWait, but in the hollow cube, the small cubes on the outer surface have some of their faces on the outside (painted), and some adjacent to other small cubes (unpainted). But the inner surfaces, where the small cubes face the hollow space, are also unpainted.\n\nSo, each small cube in the hollow structure can have some faces painted and others not.\n\nSo, the total number of small cube faces that are unpainted would be:\n\nTotal faces = 98 small cubes *6 = 588.\n\nMinus the painted faces: 150.\n\nSo 588-150=438. So the answer is 438, which is option A.\n\nWait, but wait. Another way to compute unpainted faces is to consider all the internal faces. The hollow cube has walls of 1cm. So for each face of the hollow cube, the small cubes are arranged as a 5x5 grid, but the inner 3x3 is hollow.\n\nSo, for each face, the number of small cubes is 5x5=25, but the inner 3x3 is missing. So the number of small cubes per face is 25-9=16. But each of these 16 small cubes is part of the structure.\n\nWait, perhaps that's complicating things. Let me think differently.\n\nAnother approach is to consider each small cube and count how many of its faces are unpainted. Then sum all those.\n\nBut that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, the total unpainted faces include both the internal faces (between small cubes) and the faces facing the hollow.\n\nWait, each small cube in the structure has some faces that are adjacent to other small cubes (unpainted), some that are on the outer surface (painted), and some that are facing the hollow (unpainted).\n\nSo, for each small cube, the number of unpainted faces is (6 - number of painted faces - number of hollow-exposed faces).\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total number of internal faces.\n\nIn a cube, the internal faces are those between small cubes. Each internal face is shared between two small cubes, so we need to count each once.\n\nThe total number of internal faces can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor each dimension, the number of internal faces is (n-1) * (m) * (p), where n, m, p are the dimensions.\n\nWait, but in a cube, it's 3D, so for each direction (x, y, z), the number of internal faces is (length-1) * (width) * (height).\n\nWait, perhaps another way. The number of internal faces is equal to the number of adjacent small cube pairs multiplied by the number of faces they share.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to calculate the total number of faces in the structure and subtract the painted ones and the hollow-exposed ones.\n\nWait, another approach: The total number of faces in all small cubes is 98 *6=588.\n\nOf these, 150 are on the outside (painted).\n\nThe remaining faces are either internal (shared between two small cubes) or facing the hollow.\n\nSo, the unpainted faces = 588 -150 =438.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because the faces facing the hollow are not counted in the internal faces. So the 438 includes both internal faces between cubes and the faces that are on the inner side of the hollow.\n\nWait, but perhaps the initial approach is correct because when you subtract the 150 painted faces from the total 588, you get all the unpainted ones, which includes both the internal faces (between cubes) and the faces that are on the inner side of the hollow.\n\nSo, the answer would be 438, which is option A.\n",

The hollow cube's walls are 1cm thick, so each face of the hollow cube has a 5x5 area, but the inner part is 3x3. So for each face, the outer 5x5 is the painted area, and the inner 3x3 is the hollow. But wait, the inner 3x3 is not part of the structure, so the small cubes are only on the outer layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that the hollow cube's structure is a 5x5x5 cube with a 3x3x3 cube removed. So the small cubes are the ones that are in the outer shell. So each face of the hollow cube is a 5x5 area, but the small cubes on that face are the ones that are on the outer layer.\n\nWait, so each face of the hollow cube has 5x5=25 small cube faces, which are painted. So 6 faces, 25 each: 6*25=150 painted small cube faces.\n\nSo, the total number of painted faces is 150. So the total unpainted faces would be total faces of all small cubes (588) minus painted faces (150) = 438.\n\nWait, that's one of the options. Option A is 438. So that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Are there any other faces that are unpainted besides the inner faces? Because the small cubes on the edges and corners have multiple faces exposed, but perhaps some internal faces between small cubes are also unpainted.\n\nWait, the small cubes in the hollow cube have their outer faces painted, but their inner faces (facing the hollow) are not painted. Also, the faces that are adjacent to other small cubes are not painted, because they are internal to the structure.\n\nWait, but in the hollow cube, the small cubes on the outer surface have some of their faces on the outside (painted), and some adjacent to other small cubes (unpainted). But the inner surfaces, where the small cubes face the hollow space, are also unpainted.\n\nSo, each small cube in the hollow structure can have some faces painted and others not.\n\nSo, the total number of small cube faces that are unpainted would be:\n\nTotal faces = 98 small cubes *6 = 588.\n\nMinus the painted faces: 150.\n\nSo 588-150=438. So the answer is 438, which is option A.\n\nWait, but wait. Another way to compute unpainted faces is to consider all the internal faces. The hollow cube has walls of 1cm. So for each face of the hollow cube, the small cubes are arranged as a 5x5 grid, but the inner 3x3 is hollow.\n\nSo, for each face, the number of small cubes is 5x5=25, but the inner 3x3 is missing. So the number of small cubes per face is 25-9=16. But each of these 16 small cubes is part of the structure.\n\nWait, perhaps that's complicating things. Let me think differently.\n\nAnother approach is to consider each small cube and count how many of its faces are unpainted. Then sum all those.\n\nBut that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, the total unpainted faces include both the internal faces (between small cubes) and the faces facing the hollow.\n\nWait, each small cube in the structure has some faces that are adjacent to other small cubes (unpainted), some that are on the outer surface (painted), and some that are facing the hollow (unpainted).\n\nSo, for each small cube, the number of unpainted faces is (6 - number of painted faces - number of hollow-exposed faces).\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total number of internal faces.\n\nIn a cube, the internal faces are those between small cubes. Each internal face is shared between two small cubes, so we need to count each once.\n\nThe total number of internal faces can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor each dimension, the number of internal faces is (n-1) * (m) * (p), where n, m, p are the dimensions.\n\nWait, but in a cube, it's 3D, so for each direction (x, y, z), the number of internal faces is (length-1) * (width) * (height).\n\nWait, perhaps another way. The number of internal faces is equal to the number of adjacent small cube pairs multiplied by the number of faces they share.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to calculate the total number of faces in the structure and subtract the painted ones and the hollow-exposed ones.\n\nWait, another approach: The total number of faces in all small cubes is 98 *6=588.\n\nOf these, 150 are on the outside (painted).\n\nThe remaining faces are either internal (shared between two small cubes) or facing the hollow.\n\nSo, the unpainted faces = 588 -150 =438.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because the faces facing the hollow are not counted in the internal faces. So the 438 includes both internal faces between cubes and the faces that are on the inner side of the hollow.\n\nWait, but perhaps the initial approach is correct because when you subtract the 150 painted faces from the total 588, you get all the unpainted ones, which includes both the internal faces (between cubes) and the faces that are on the inner side of the hollow.\n\nSo, the answer would be 438, which is option A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the hollow cube of size 5 cm (outer dimensions) with a thickness of 1 cm. The cube is made up of smaller cubes of size 1 cm. The total number of small cubes in the structure is calculated as follows:\n\n1. **Total small cubes in the outer 5x5x5 cube**:  \n   \\[\n   5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 125\n   \\]\n\n2. **Inner hollow space (3x3x3)**:  \n   \\[\n   3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total small cubes in the hollow structure**:  \n   \\[\n   125 - 27 = 98\n   \\]\n\nEach small cube has 6 faces, so the total number of faces across all small cubes is:  \n\\[\n98 \\times 6 = 588\n\\]\n\nThe outer surface of the hollow cube is painted. Each face of the hollow cube has dimensions 5x5, so the total number of painted faces is:  \n\\[\n6 \\times (5 \\times 5) = 6 \\times 25 = 150\n\\]\n\nThe number of unpainted faces is the total number of faces minus the painted faces:  \n\\[\n588 - 150 = 438\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of unpainted faces of the smaller cubes is **438**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hollow cube. Let me try to visualize it. The cube is 5 cm in size, and each side is 1 cm thick. So wait, does that mean each edge of the cube is 5 cm long, and the walls are 1 cm thick? Oh right, because it's hollow, so the inside is empty except for the walls.\n\nThe cube is made up of smaller 1 cm cubes. So each small cube is 1x1x1 cm. The question is about painting the outer surface. Once painted, some of the small cubes will have one or more faces painted. But the ones inside the hollow part won't be painted at all. Wait, but the problem is asking how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted. Hmm, that's a bit different. Oh, right, it's about the total number of individual faces across all small cubes that are not painted.\n\nLet me think. So each small cube can have up to three painted faces if it's at a corner, two if it's on an edge but not a corner, one if it's on a face but not an edge, or none if it's inside. But since the cube is hollow, the inner part is empty. So I don't have to consider small cubes inside; the hollow part has no cubes. So all the small cubes are on the surface.\n\nWait, wait. The cube is hollow, so the inside is empty. So the small cubes are only on the outer surfaces, right? So the total number of small cubes is the surface cubes, but each face of the hollow cube is a 5x5 square, but considering the thickness, perhaps it's more complicated.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate the total number of small cubes first. The cube is 5 cm on each side, but the walls are 1 cm thick. So the hollow part inside is 3x3x3 cm. Because 5 minus 2 times the thickness (1 cm on each side) gives 3 cm. So the total number of small cubes is the outer shell.\n\nThe total cubes in a 5x5x5 cube would be 125. The inner hollow part is 3x3x3, which is 27. So the number of small cubes in the shell is 125 - 27 = 98. So 98 small cubes.\n\nEach small cube has 6 faces. So the total number of faces is 98 * 6 = 588. But wait, when we paint the outer surfaces, each face of the cube has 5x5=25 small cube faces painted. So the total painted faces are 6 * 25 = 150.\n\nSo the total unpainted faces would be 588 (all) minus 150 (painted) = 438. Wait, but is that correct? Because each small cube's face is only counted once, but when they are on edges or corners, their painted faces are shared between multiple cube faces.\n\nWait, no. Because when we calculate the total painted faces, each painted face on a small cube is part of the larger cube's face. So the initial approach might not be correct. Because when I subtract 150 from 588, I'm assuming that each of the 150 is a unique face. But actually, the small cubes on edges and corners have multiple painted faces, but each of those counts as a painted face in the total.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach should be to find the total number of small cube faces that are on the exterior, then subtract the painted ones. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simpler.\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking about all the faces of all the small cubes. So each small cube has 6 faces. The total is 98 * 6 = 588. Then, how many of these are painted? Each small cube on the surface contributes some painted faces.\n\nEach face of the large cube is a 5x5 grid. So each face has 25 small cube faces painted. Since the large cube has 6 faces, 25*6=150 small cube faces are painted.\n\nSo the unpainted faces would be 588 - 150 = 438. So the answer is 438, which is option A.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check. Are there any other unpainted faces? For instance, the inner faces of the hollow cube\u2014like the faces that are on the inside of the walls but not on the exterior. Do those count as unpainted? Because the hollow cube's walls have thickness 1 cm, so each wall is a 1 cm thick layer.\n\nSo for example, on each face of the large cube, the small cubes on the surface have one face painted. But the adjacent cubes (the ones behind them, in the same wall) have that face (towards the exterior) painted, but their other faces might be unpainted.\n\nWait, but in this scenario, the hollow cube's walls are 1 cm thick. So each face of the large cube has a 5x5 grid of small cubes, each with one face painted. But the other faces of these small cubes (the ones that are on the inner side of the wall) are not painted. So each small cube on the exterior has one face painted, and the other five faces might or might not be painted.\n\nWait no, because the small cubes are only on the surface. For example, a small cube in the middle of a face has one face painted. The ones on edges have two faces painted, and the ones at the corners have three.\n\nWait, but if the cube is hollow, the small cubes are only on the outer surface. So each small cube in the shell has some number of faces exposed to the outside, which are painted, and the other faces are either adjacent to another small cube or to the hollow space.\n\nWait, perhaps each small cube in the shell has some of their faces painted (the ones on the outside), and the others are internal to the shell. So for example, a cube on a face (but not edge or corner) has one painted face, and the other five faces: but three are adjacent to other small cubes in the shell (so they're internal, not painted), and two are on the inside of the hollow, which are also not painted. Wait, no, because the hollow is empty, so those faces are not painted.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Each small cube in the shell has some of their faces painted, and others not. The total number of painted small cube faces is 150, as each face of the large cube has 25. So 6*25=150.\n\nSo total unpainted small cube faces is 98*6 (all) - 150 (painted) = 588 - 150 = 438. So the answer should be 438, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, another approach: for each small cube, how many faces are not painted.\n\nEach small cube is on the surface of the large cube. Let's calculate how many of their faces are unpainted.\n\nEach small cube can be in different positions: corner, edge, face center, or maybe not. Wait, the cube is hollow, so all the small cubes are on the surface.\n\nIn a 5x5x5 cube, the small cubes can be:\n\n- Corner cubes: 8 in total, each with 3 painted faces.\n- Edge cubes (not corners): each edge has (5-2) =3 cubes, 12 edges, so 36 cubes, each with 2 painted faces.\n- Face centers: each face has (5-2)^2=9 cubes, 6 faces, so 54 cubes, each with 1 painted face.\n\nWait, wait. But wait, wait. The hollow cube is 5x5x5, but with a thickness of 1 cm. So the actual structure is a shell that's 1 cm thick. So the small cubes are arranged as the outer layer.\n\nIn this shell, each face is 5x5 small cubes, but the cubes on the edges and corners are shared between multiple faces.\n\nSo the total number of small cubes in the shell is 5^3 - 3^3 = 125-27=98, as I calculated before.\n\nEach small cube can be categorized based on how many of their faces are on the exterior:\n\n- Corner small cubes: Each corner of the large cube has a small cube. Each has 3 exterior faces. There are 8 corners.\n\n- Edge small cubes: Each edge of the cube (excluding the corners) has small cubes. Each edge is 5 units long, but the corners are already counted, so 5-2 =3 small cubes per edge. There are 12 edges, so 12*3=36. Each of these has 2 exterior faces.\n\n- Face centers: Each face has (5-2)*(5-2)=3x3=9 small cubes (excluding edges and corners). 6 faces, so 6*9=54. Each has 1 exterior face.\n\nWait, but wait. The 5x5 face of the cube has a 3x3 grid of cubes in the center that are not on the edges. So each face has 9 such cubes, each contributing one painted face.\n\nSo, the number of painted small cube faces is:\n\nCorners: 8 cubes *3 faces =24\nEdges:36 cubes *2 faces=72\nFaces:54 cubes *1 face=54\nTotal painted: 24+72+54=150. Which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nSo the total painted small cube faces is 150.\n\nEach small cube has 6 faces, so 98 cubes *6 =588.\n\nUnpainted is 588-150=438. So the answer should be A)438.\n",

The question is about painting the outer surface and figuring out how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted.\n\nWait, wait. I think I need to visualize this. A hollow cube with size 5 cm. Hmm, wait, does the size refer to the edge length? Because a cube's size is usually given as the edge length.

Oh right, because each face's thickness contributes 1 cm on each side. So the inner dimensions would be 5 - 2*(1) = 3 cm on each edge. So the inner cube is 3x3x3 cm.\n\nSo the entire cube is 5x5x5, and the hollow part is 3x3x3. So the number of small cubes in the entire structure is 5^3 = 125. The hollow part is 3^3=27. So the number of small cubes making up the shell is 125-27=98. But wait, the question is about the faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted. Oh, right, because when you paint the outer surface, only the outer faces get painted. The inner faces (the hollow part) are not painted. So the problem is to find how many faces of all the small cubes are not painted.\n\nWait, the question says \"how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted.\" So each small cube can have 0 to 3 faces painted, depending on their position. But we need to count all the faces that are not painted.\n\nWait, but another approach: when the outer surface is painted, each face of the big cube is painted. The total number of small cube faces painted would be the surface area of the big cube, which is 6 faces each of 5x5, so 6*25=150. But wait, no, because each small cube face is 1x1 cm, so each face of the big cube has 5x5=25 small faces. So total painted small cube faces are 6*25=150.\n\nBut wait, the cube is hollow. So the inner surfaces are not painted. So the inner part's surfaces would have some faces that are not painted. But wait, in the hollow cube, the inner surfaces are the ones that were in contact with the hollow space, right? But when the outer surface is painted, only the outer faces of the small cubes are painted. The inner faces of the small cubes (those facing the hollow) are not painted, because they are on the inside. So the question is to find all the faces of the small cubes that are not painted, whether they are on the inside or on the other sides.\n\nWait, but each small cube can have multiple faces. Let me think about this. Each small cube can have up to 3 faces painted if it's on a corner. But in the hollow cube, the inner surfaces are not painted. So for each small cube, the number of painted faces is the number of their faces that are on the exterior. The unpainted faces would be the remaining faces plus any faces that are on the inside.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's think about all the small cubes and their faces. Each small cube has 6 faces. The total number of small cube faces is 125 (small cubes) * 6 = 750.\n\nOut of these, 150 faces are painted (the outer surfaces). But wait, wait\u2014no. Wait, no, the outer surfaces of the big cube consist of 5x5x6=150 small cube faces. So 150 small cube faces are painted.\n\nBut wait, the hollow part is 3x3x3. So the inner surfaces are 3x3x6=54 small cube faces. So those 54 inner faces are not painted. But also, the small cubes on the edges or corners have their other faces possibly unpainted.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no, the inner surfaces are 3x3 per face, and 6 faces, so 54. So those 54 are not painted. So the total unpainted faces would be 54 plus the other unpainted faces of the small cubes in the shell.\n\nWait, no. Because the small cubes in the shell have their outer faces painted, but their inner faces are the ones in the hollow. So each small cube in the shell has one face that's part of the hollow (the inner face) and one face that's painted. Wait, no. Actually, each small cube in the shell is on the exterior, so they have one face (or more, depending on position) painted. The inner faces of these shell cubes are the ones that are facing the hollow, which are not painted. So each shell cube contributes some number of unpainted faces.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the easiest approach is to calculate the total number of small cube faces, subtract the painted ones, and that's the unpainted.\n\nTotal small cube faces: 125 * 6 = 750.\n\nPainted faces: 6 * (5*5) = 150.\n\nUnpainted: 750 - 150 = 600.\n\nWait, but wait, that's not considering the inner surfaces. Because the hollow cube has inner surfaces that are not painted. But according to this approach, the unpainted includes both the inner surfaces and any other faces not on the exterior.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no. When you paint the outer surface, the inner surfaces (the hollow) are not painted. So in the entire structure, all the faces of the small cubes that are on the exterior are painted, and all the faces that are on the interior (facing the hollow) are not painted.\n\nBut wait, each small cube in the shell may have more than one face painted. For example, a corner cube has three faces painted. So the number of painted faces is 150, but that's not the same as the number of small cubes with painted faces. Because each painted face is a separate count.\n\nSo the total painted small cube faces are 150. The total unpainted would be 750 - 150 = 600. But wait, the hollow part's inner surfaces are 3x3x6=54. So 54 of the unpainted faces are in the hollow. But what about the other unpainted faces? Because each small cube in the shell has some faces that are not painted because they are adjacent to other small cubes in the shell. For example, a cube on the edge (but not corner) would have two faces painted, so four faces unpainted. But wait, perhaps the total unpainted is 600, which includes both the hollow's inner surfaces and the adjacent faces between shell cubes.\n\nWait, but the question is about how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted. So if I just calculate 750 (all faces) minus 150 (painted) gives 600. But looking at the options, none of them are 600. The options are A)438, B)550, C)500, D)450, E)498. So my initial approach must be wrong.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the cube is hollow, meaning that only the outer layer is present, and the inner part is empty. So the cube is made up of 1 cm thick walls. So the outer dimensions are 5 cm on each side, and the inner hollow is 3 cm on each side (5 - 2*1=3). So the structure is like a shell.\n\nSo the total number of small cubes is the outer cube (5^3=125) minus the inner hollow (3^3=27), giving 98 small cubes. So each of these 98 cubes is part of the shell.\n\nNow, each of these 98 cubes contributes some number of faces that are on the exterior (painted) and some that are on the interior (unpainted).\n\nWait, but the question is about the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted. So each small cube can have 0, 1, 2, or 3 painted faces, depending on their position.\n\nBut perhaps the way to compute the total unpainted faces is to compute the total number of small cube faces, subtract the number of painted faces.\n\nWait, let me think. The total small cube faces is 98 * 6 = 588.\n\nWait, but wait, that's only for the shell cubes. The inner cubes are not part of the structure, as it's hollow. So the total small cubes are 98, each with 6 faces, so 588. But this approach is perhaps not correct because I'm not considering all the small cubes.\n\nWait no, the entire big cube is 5x5x5, which is 125 small cubes. But since the hollow part is 3x3x3, which is 27, so the shell is 98 cubes. So the shell has 98 cubes, each with 6 faces, so 98*6=588 faces.\n\nBut the painted faces are the outer surfaces. The outer surfaces of the big cube are 6 faces, each 5x5=25 small faces. So 6*25=150 painted small cube faces.\n\nBut wait, some of these painted faces belong to the same small cube. For example, a corner cube has three painted faces, but it's just one small cube.\n\nSo the painted faces are 150.\n\nSo the unpainted faces in the shell would be 588 - 150 = 438.\n\nWait, that's one of the options, option A is 438.\n\nBut wait, that's the number of faces of the shell cubes that are unpainted. But what about the inner hollow? The inner hollow's surfaces are not part of the shell's faces, because the shell's inner faces are the ones adjacent to the hollow.\n\nWait, but the inner hollow's surfaces are made up of the inner faces of the shell's small cubes. So each inner face of the shell is an unpainted face.\n\nWait, but in my previous calculation, the shell's total faces are 588, and painted faces are 150. So 588-150=438 unpainted faces on the shell.\n\nBut the inner hollow's surfaces are 3x3x6=54 small cube faces. These are the faces of the shell's inner sides. So these 54 faces are part of the shell's small cubes and are unpainted.\n\nSo the total unpainted faces would be 438 (from the shell's faces) plus 54 (from the hollow's inner faces). Wait, but that can't be, because the 438 already includes the inner faces of the shell.\n\nWait, no, wait. The 588 faces are all the faces of the shell cubes. The painted faces are 150, which are the ones on the outside. The remaining 438 are the inner faces of the shell (facing the hollow) and any adjacent faces between shell cubes.\n\nWait, but no, because the adjacent faces between shell cubes are internal and not painted. So in the shell, each small cube's face that is adjacent to another shell cube is an internal face and thus unpainted. Also, each small cube's face that is facing the hollow is also unpainted.\n\nWait, but in the shell, each small cube may have up to 3 or 4 faces that are either adjacent to other shell cubes or facing the hollow. So the unpainted faces of the shell cubes are the ones not on the exterior.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the total number of unpainted faces as (all faces of all small cubes) minus (painted faces).\n\nSo total small cubes: 125. Each has 6 faces: 125*6=750.\n\nPainted faces: 6*(5*5)=150.\n\nSo unpainted: 750-150=600.\n\nBut the options don't have 600. So perhaps this approach is incorrect because the hollow's inner surfaces are not part of the structure. Wait, no. Wait, the inner surfaces are part of the small cubes in the shell. Because the hollow is empty space, but the small cubes in the shell have their inner faces exposed to the hollow.\n\nSo when I subtract the painted faces from the total, I get 600, which includes all unpainted faces, including those in the hollow. But wait, the question is about the smaller cubes' faces. So if the hollow is empty, then the inner surfaces are part of the shell's small cubes, so the 600 unpainted faces include both the inner faces and the faces between the shell cubes.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, 600 isn't an option. So perhaps this approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by calculating the number of unpainted faces on the shell cubes.\n\nThe shell has 98 small cubes. Each cube's face that is on the exterior is painted. The faces that are on the interior (facing the hollow) and adjacent to other shell cubes are unpainted.\n\nSo each shell cube has some number of painted and unpainted faces.\n\nLet me calculate the total number of painted faces on the shell. The shell is 5x5x5 with a hollow of 3x3x3.\n\nEach face of the big cube is a 5x5 square, so each face has 25 small cube faces painted. 6 faces: 150.\n\nNow, the shell cubes include all the cubes except the hollow. So the painted faces are 150.\n\nThe total number of faces on all shell cubes is 98 *6=588.\n\nSo the number of unpainted faces on the shell cubes is 588 - 150 = 438.\n\nBut wait, this includes all the faces that are not on the exterior. That would include the inner faces (facing the hollow) and the faces that are glued to adjacent shell cubes.\n\nSo the 438 would be the number of faces of the shell cubes that are not painted. But the question is about the smaller cubes, which includes the entire structure. Wait, no. The question is about all the small cubes that make up the hollow cube. But the hollow part is empty; the small cubes are only the 98 in the shell.\n\nSo the question is, how many faces of the smaller cubes (the 98) remain unpainted. So the answer would be 438.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 438.\n\nBut wait, another thought: when the hollow is 3x3x3, each of its faces is 3x3. So the inner surfaces are 3x3x6=54. So 54 of the shell's inner faces are unpainted. The rest of the shell's faces that are between cubes are also unpainted.\n\nBut if I add the inner faces (54) to the adjacent internal faces between shell cubes, how does that relate to 438?\n\nWait, 438 includes all the unpainted faces of the shell, which includes both the inner (facing the hollow) and the internal (adjacent to other shell cubes) faces.\n\nBut perhaps the question is only considering the outer surfaces as painted, and the inner surfaces as unpainted. But the 438 includes both.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about each face of the big cube as having 5x5=25 small faces painted, so 150 in total. The inner surfaces of the shell cubes (the faces that form the hollow) are 3x3x6=54, which are unpainted. The remaining unpainted faces are those where the shell cubes are adjacent to each other.\n\nWait, but the shell is a 5x5x5 cube with a 3x3x3 hollow. So the shell is made up of all cubes except those in the hollow. The shell's structure is such that it has 6 faces (the outer surfaces), and the inner surfaces.\n\nBut each face of the shell's inner surfaces is 3x3, so 54.\n\nThe other unpainted faces are those that are between shell cubes. For example, consider the top face of a cube that's adjacent to another cube on top; that face is not painted.\n\nWait, perhaps the total unpainted faces are the sum of the inner surfaces and the internal faces between the shell cubes.\n\nBut calculating that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of unpainted faces is the total number of small cube faces minus the painted ones.\n\nWhich is 750 - 150 = 600. But since the hollow is 3x3x3, the inner surfaces are 54, which are all unpainted. So 600 includes 54 plus the internal faces between shell cubes.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 600. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the number of faces of the smaller cubes that are not painted, not considering the internal hollow's surfaces. Because the hollow's surfaces are empty space, so the faces of the small cubes that face the hollow are the ones that are unpainted.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the smaller cubes\", so all their faces, whether they're on the inside or not. So the unpainted faces include both the inner faces (facing the hollow) and any faces not on the exterior.\n\nSo the correct approach is to calculate the total number of small cube faces (125 * 6 = 750) minus the number of painted faces (150) equals 600.\n\nBut none of the options are 600. So perhaps the problem is that the cube is hollow, so the inner surfaces are not part of the structure. Wait, no. The hollow cube is made of small cubes, so the inner surfaces are part of those small cubes. So their faces are present.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the inner surfaces are not painted, but the adjacent faces between shell cubes are also not painted. So the 600 includes all of them. But the options don't have 600, so perhaps I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about how many small cubes are in the shell. The shell has 5x5x5 - 3x3x3 = 125-27=98 cubes.\n\nEach of these 98 cubes contributes some number of faces. The total faces for these 98 cubes are 98*6=588.\n\nThe painted faces are the outer surfaces: 6*(5*5)=150. But some of these are part of the same small cube. For example, a corner cube contributes three painted faces.\n\nSo the number of painted faces is 150, as calculated.\n\nSo the number of unpainted faces on the shell cubes is 588 - 150 = 438.\n\nAh, so the answer would be 438, which is option A.\n\nBut why does this approach give 438, and not 600? Because in this case, we're only considering the shell cubes. The shell has 98 cubes, each with 6 faces, so 588. Subtract the 150 painted, leaves 438 unpainted. So option A is 438.\n\nWait, but the question is about the smaller cubes, which are all the small cubes in the hollow cube. But the hollow cube is made up of the shell cubes only. The hollow part is empty. So each face of the hollow is a face of a shell cube, but that face is unpainted.\n\nSo in this case, the 438 includes both the internal faces (facing the hollow) and the faces between shell cubes.\n\nSo the answer is 438, which is option A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the hollow cube structure. The cube has an outer edge length of 5 cm and a thickness of 1 cm, making the inner hollow cube have an edge length of 3 cm (since the thickness reduces 1 cm from both sides).

This includes both the inner faces of the shell cubes (facing the hollow) and the faces between adjacent shell cubes. \n\nANSWER: A",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about a hollow cube. Let me try to understand what's being asked here. The cube is hollow, right? The size is 5 cm, and the thickness is 1 cm. It's made up of smaller cubes that are 1 cm each. So each small cube is 1x1x1 cm. The question is about painting the outer surface and figuring out how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted.\n\nWait, wait. I think I need to visualize this. A hollow cube with size 5 cm. Hmm, wait, does the size refer to the edge length? Because a cube's size is usually given as the edge length. So if the cube is 5 cm on each side, but the thickness is 1 cm, that implies that it's a hollow cube with walls 1 cm thick. So the outer dimensions are 5x5x5 cm, and the inner hollow part would be a bit smaller.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. The thickness is 1 cm, so the outer surface is 5 cm, but the inner part is 5 cm minus 2 times the thickness, because the thickness is on both sides. Oh right, because each face's thickness contributes 1 cm on each side. So the inner dimensions would be 5 - 2*(1) = 3 cm on each edge. So the inner cube is 3x3x3 cm.\n\nSo the entire cube is 5x5x5, and the hollow part is 3x3x3. So the number of small cubes in the entire structure is 5^3 = 125. The hollow part is 3^3=27. So the number of small cubes making up the shell is 125-27=98. But wait, the question is about the faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted. Oh, right, because when you paint the outer surface, only the outer faces get painted. The inner faces (the hollow part) are not painted. So the problem is to find how many faces of all the small cubes are not painted.\n\nWait, the question says \"how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted.\" So each small cube can have 0 to 3 faces painted, depending on their position. But we need to count all the faces that are not painted.\n\nWait, but another approach: when the outer surface is painted, each face of the big cube is painted. The total number of small cube faces painted would be the surface area of the big cube, which is 6 faces each of 5x5, so 6*25=150. But wait, no, because each small cube face is 1x1 cm, so each face of the big cube has 5x5=25 small faces. So total painted small cube faces are 6*25=150.\n\nBut wait, the cube is hollow. So the inner surfaces are not painted. So the inner part's surfaces would have some faces that are not painted. But wait, in the hollow cube, the inner surfaces are the ones that were in contact with the hollow space, right? But when the outer surface is painted, only the outer faces of the small cubes are painted. The inner faces of the small cubes (those facing the hollow) are not painted, because they are on the inside. So the question is to find all the faces of the small cubes that are not painted, whether they are on the inside or on the other sides.\n\nWait, but each small cube can have multiple faces. Let me think about this. Each small cube can have up to 3 faces painted if it's on a corner. But in the hollow cube, the inner surfaces are not painted. So for each small cube, the number of painted faces is the number of their faces that are on the exterior. The unpainted faces would be the remaining faces plus any faces that are on the inside.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's think about all the small cubes and their faces. Each small cube has 6 faces. The total number of small cube faces is 125 (small cubes) * 6 = 750.\n\nOut of these, 150 faces are painted (the outer surfaces). But wait, wait\u2014no. Wait, no, the outer surfaces of the big cube consist of 5x5x6=150 small cube faces. So 150 small cube faces are painted.\n\nBut wait, the hollow part is 3x3x3. So the inner surfaces are 3x3x6=54 small cube faces. So those 54 inner faces are not painted. But also, the small cubes on the edges or corners have their other faces possibly unpainted.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no, the inner surfaces are 3x3 per face, and 6 faces, so 54. So those 54 are not painted. So the total unpainted faces would be 54 plus the other unpainted faces of the small cubes in the shell.\n\nWait, no. Because the small cubes in the shell have their outer faces painted, but their inner faces are the ones in the hollow. So each small cube in the shell has one face that's part of the hollow (the inner face) and one face that's painted. Wait, no. Actually, each small cube in the shell is on the exterior, so they have one face (or more, depending on position) painted. The inner faces of these shell cubes are the ones that are facing the hollow, which are not painted. So each shell cube contributes some number of unpainted faces.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the easiest approach is to calculate the total number of small cube faces, subtract the painted ones, and that's the unpainted.\n\nTotal small cube faces: 125 * 6 = 750.\n\nPainted faces: 6 * (5*5) = 150.\n\nUnpainted: 750 - 150 = 600.\n\nWait, but wait, that's not considering the inner surfaces. Because the hollow cube has inner surfaces that are not painted. But according to this approach, the unpainted includes both the inner surfaces and any other faces not on the exterior.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no. When you paint the outer surface, the inner surfaces (the hollow) are not painted. So in the entire structure, all the faces of the small cubes that are on the exterior are painted, and all the faces that are on the interior (facing the hollow) are not painted.\n\nBut wait, each small cube in the shell may have more than one face painted. For example, a corner cube has three faces painted. So the number of painted faces is 150, but that's not the same as the number of small cubes with painted faces. Because each painted face is a separate count.\n\nSo the total painted small cube faces are 150. The total unpainted would be 750 - 150 = 600. But wait, the hollow part's inner surfaces are 3x3x6=54. So 54 of the unpainted faces are in the hollow. But what about the other unpainted faces? Because each small cube in the shell has some faces that are not painted because they are adjacent to other small cubes in the shell. For example, a cube on the edge (but not corner) would have two faces painted, so four faces unpainted. But wait, perhaps the total unpainted is 600, which includes both the hollow's inner surfaces and the adjacent faces between shell cubes.\n\nWait, but the question is about how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted. So if I just calculate 750 (all faces) minus 150 (painted) gives 600. But looking at the options, none of them are 600. The options are A)438, B)550, C)500, D)450, E)498. So my initial approach must be wrong.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the cube is hollow, meaning that only the outer layer is present, and the inner part is empty. So the cube is made up of 1 cm thick walls. So the outer dimensions are 5 cm on each side, and the inner hollow is 3 cm on each side (5 - 2*1=3). So the structure is like a shell.\n\nSo the total number of small cubes is the outer cube (5^3=125) minus the inner hollow (3^3=27), giving 98 small cubes. So each of these 98 cubes is part of the shell.\n\nNow, each of these 98 cubes contributes some number of faces that are on the exterior (painted) and some that are on the interior (unpainted).\n\nWait, but the question is about the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted. So each small cube can have 0, 1, 2, or 3 painted faces, depending on their position.\n\nBut perhaps the way to compute the total unpainted faces is to compute the total number of small cube faces, subtract the number of painted faces.\n\nWait, let me think. The total small cube faces is 98 * 6 = 588.\n\nWait, but wait, that's only for the shell cubes. The inner cubes are not part of the structure, as it's hollow. So the total small cubes are 98, each with 6 faces, so 588. But this approach is perhaps not correct because I'm not considering all the small cubes.\n\nWait no, the entire big cube is 5x5x5, which is 125 small cubes. But since the hollow part is 3x3x3, which is 27, so the shell is 98 cubes. So the shell has 98 cubes, each with 6 faces, so 98*6=588 faces.\n\nBut the painted faces are the outer surfaces. The outer surfaces of the big cube are 6 faces, each 5x5=25 small faces. So 6*25=150 painted small cube faces.\n\nBut wait, some of these painted faces belong to the same small cube. For example, a corner cube has three painted faces, but it's just one small cube.\n\nSo the painted faces are 150.\n\nSo the unpainted faces in the shell would be 588 - 150 = 438.\n\nWait, that's one of the options, option A is 438.\n\nBut wait, that's the number of faces of the shell cubes that are unpainted. But what about the inner hollow? The inner hollow's surfaces are not part of the shell's faces, because the shell's inner faces are the ones adjacent to the hollow.\n\nWait, but the inner hollow's surfaces are made up of the inner faces of the shell's small cubes. So each inner face of the shell is an unpainted face.\n\nWait, but in my previous calculation, the shell's total faces are 588, and painted faces are 150. So 588-150=438 unpainted faces on the shell.\n\nBut the inner hollow's surfaces are 3x3x6=54 small cube faces. These are the faces of the shell's inner sides. So these 54 faces are part of the shell's small cubes and are unpainted.\n\nSo the total unpainted faces would be 438 (from the shell's faces) plus 54 (from the hollow's inner faces). Wait, but that can't be, because the 438 already includes the inner faces of the shell.\n\nWait, no, wait. The 588 faces are all the faces of the shell cubes. The painted faces are 150, which are the ones on the outside. The remaining 438 are the inner faces of the shell (facing the hollow) and any adjacent faces between shell cubes.\n\nWait, but no, because the adjacent faces between shell cubes are internal and not painted. So in the shell, each small cube's face that is adjacent to another shell cube is an internal face and thus unpainted. Also, each small cube's face that is facing the hollow is also unpainted.\n\nWait, but in the shell, each small cube may have up to 3 or 4 faces that are either adjacent to other shell cubes or facing the hollow. So the unpainted faces of the shell cubes are the ones not on the exterior.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the total number of unpainted faces as (all faces of all small cubes) minus (painted faces).\n\nSo total small cubes: 125. Each has 6 faces: 125*6=750.\n\nPainted faces: 6*(5*5)=150.\n\nSo unpainted: 750-150=600.\n\nBut the options don't have 600. So perhaps this approach is incorrect because the hollow's inner surfaces are not part of the structure. Wait, no. Wait, the inner surfaces are part of the small cubes in the shell. Because the hollow is empty space, but the small cubes in the shell have their inner faces exposed to the hollow.\n\nSo when I subtract the painted faces from the total, I get 600, which includes all unpainted faces, including those in the hollow. But wait, the question is about the smaller cubes' faces. So if the hollow is empty, then the inner surfaces are part of the shell's small cubes, so the 600 unpainted faces include both the inner faces and the faces between the shell cubes.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, 600 isn't an option. So perhaps this approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by calculating the number of unpainted faces on the shell cubes.\n\nThe shell has 98 small cubes. Each cube's face that is on the exterior is painted. The faces that are on the interior (facing the hollow) and adjacent to other shell cubes are unpainted.\n\nSo each shell cube has some number of painted and unpainted faces.\n\nLet me calculate the total number of painted faces on the shell. The shell is 5x5x5 with a hollow of 3x3x3.\n\nEach face of the big cube is a 5x5 square, so each face has 25 small cube faces painted. 6 faces: 150.\n\nNow, the shell cubes include all the cubes except the hollow. So the painted faces are 150.\n\nThe total number of faces on all shell cubes is 98 *6=588.\n\nSo the number of unpainted faces on the shell cubes is 588 - 150 = 438.\n\nBut wait, this includes all the faces that are not on the exterior. That would include the inner faces (facing the hollow) and the faces that are glued to adjacent shell cubes.\n\nSo the 438 would be the number of faces of the shell cubes that are not painted. But the question is about the smaller cubes, which includes the entire structure. Wait, no. The question is about all the small cubes that make up the hollow cube. But the hollow part is empty; the small cubes are only the 98 in the shell.\n\nSo the question is, how many faces of the smaller cubes (the 98) remain unpainted. So the answer would be 438.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 438.\n\nBut wait, another thought: when the hollow is 3x3x3, each of its faces is 3x3. So the inner surfaces are 3x3x6=54. So 54 of the shell's inner faces are unpainted. The rest of the shell's faces that are between cubes are also unpainted.\n\nBut if I add the inner faces (54) to the adjacent internal faces between shell cubes, how does that relate to 438?\n\nWait, 438 includes all the unpainted faces of the shell, which includes both the inner (facing the hollow) and the internal (adjacent to other shell cubes) faces.\n\nBut perhaps the question is only considering the outer surfaces as painted, and the inner surfaces as unpainted. But the 438 includes both.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about each face of the big cube as having 5x5=25 small faces painted, so 150 in total. The inner surfaces of the shell cubes (the faces that form the hollow) are 3x3x6=54, which are unpainted. The remaining unpainted faces are those where the shell cubes are adjacent to each other.\n\nWait, but the shell is a 5x5x5 cube with a 3x3x3 hollow. So the shell is made up of all cubes except those in the hollow. The shell's structure is such that it has 6 faces (the outer surfaces), and the inner surfaces.\n\nBut each face of the shell's inner surfaces is 3x3, so 54.\n\nThe other unpainted faces are those that are between shell cubes. For example, consider the top face of a cube that's adjacent to another cube on top; that face is not painted.\n\nWait, perhaps the total unpainted faces are the sum of the inner surfaces and the internal faces between the shell cubes.\n\nBut calculating that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of unpainted faces is the total number of small cube faces minus the painted ones.\n\nWhich is 750 - 150 = 600. But since the hollow is 3x3x3, the inner surfaces are 54, which are all unpainted. So 600 includes 54 plus the internal faces between shell cubes.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 600. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the number of faces of the smaller cubes that are not painted, not considering the internal hollow's surfaces. Because the hollow's surfaces are empty space, so the faces of the small cubes that face the hollow are the ones that are unpainted.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the smaller cubes\", so all their faces, whether they're on the inside or not. So the unpainted faces include both the inner faces (facing the hollow) and any faces not on the exterior.\n\nSo the correct approach is to calculate the total number of small cube faces (125 * 6 = 750) minus the number of painted faces (150) equals 600.\n\nBut none of the options are 600. So perhaps the problem is that the cube is hollow, so the inner surfaces are not part of the structure. Wait, no. The hollow cube is made of small cubes, so the inner surfaces are part of those small cubes. So their faces are present.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the inner surfaces are not painted, but the adjacent faces between shell cubes are also not painted. So the 600 includes all of them. But the options don't have 600, so perhaps I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about how many small cubes are in the shell. The shell has 5x5x5 - 3x3x3 = 125-27=98 cubes.\n\nEach of these 98 cubes contributes some number of faces. The total faces for these 98 cubes are 98*6=588.\n\nThe painted faces are the outer surfaces: 6*(5*5)=150. But some of these are part of the same small cube. For example, a corner cube contributes three painted faces.\n\nSo the number of painted faces is 150, as calculated.\n\nSo the number of unpainted faces on the shell cubes is 588 - 150 = 438.\n\nAh, so the answer would be 438, which is option A.\n\nBut why does this approach give 438, and not 600? Because in this case, we're only considering the shell cubes. The shell has 98 cubes, each with 6 faces, so 588. Subtract the 150 painted, leaves 438 unpainted. So option A is 438.\n\nWait, but the question is about the smaller cubes, which are all the small cubes in the hollow cube. But the hollow cube is made up of the shell cubes only. The hollow part is empty. So each face of the hollow is a face of a shell cube, but that face is unpainted.\n\nSo in this case, the 438 includes both the internal faces (facing the hollow) and the faces between shell cubes.\n\nSo the answer is 438, which is option A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the hollow cube structure. The cube has an outer edge length of 5 cm and a thickness of 1 cm, making the inner hollow cube have an edge length of 3 cm (since the thickness reduces 1 cm from both sides). The cube is composed of smaller 1 cm\u00b3 cubes. \n\n### Key Calculations:\n1. **Total Small Cubes in the Outer Cube**:  \n   The outer cube has dimensions \\(5 \\times 5 \\times 5\\), so it contains \\(5^3 = 125\\) small cubes.\n\n2. **Total Small Cubes in the Inner Hollow**:  \n   The inner hollow cube has dimensions \\(3 \\times 3 \\times 3\\), so it contains \\(3^3 = 27\\) small cubes.\n\n3. **Number of Small Cubes in the Shell**:  \n   The shell is the difference between the outer and inner cubes:  \n   \\[\n   125 - 27 = 98 \\text{ small cubes}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Faces of All Small Cubes**:  \n   Each small cube has 6 faces, so the total number of faces for all small cubes is:  \n   \\[\n   125 \\times 6 = 750 \\text{ faces}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Painted Faces on the Outer Surface**:  \n   The outer surface of the cube has 6 faces, each of size \\(5 \\times 5\\). Thus, the total number of painted faces is:  \n   \\[\n   6 \\times (5 \\times 5) = 150 \\text{ faces}.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Unpainted Faces of the Shell Cubes**:  \n   The total number of faces of the shell cubes is:  \n   \\[\n   98 \\times 6 = 588 \\text{ faces}.\n   \\]  \n   Subtract the painted faces (150) to find the unpainted faces of the shell cubes:  \n   \\[\n   588 - 150 = 438 \\text{ faces}.\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe total number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is **438**. This includes both the inner faces of the shell cubes (facing the hollow) and the faces between adjacent shell cubes. \n\nANSWER: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a hollow cube, and I'm supposed to find out how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted after the outer surface is painted. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the cube is hollow, with a size of 5 cm on each side, and each small cube is 1 cm. So, I think the big cube is made up of 5x5x5 smaller cubes. But wait, it's hollow, so the inside isn't filled. Oh right, because it's hollow, the inner part is empty. So the total number of small cubes is 5^3 minus the inner hollow part. The inner hollow would be a cube of size 3 cm, right? Because if the big cube is 5 cm and the walls are 1 cm thick, then each dimension's inner part is 5 - 2*1 = 3 cm. So the inner cube is 3x3x3. So the total small cubes would be 125 (5^3) minus 27 (3^3) which is 98 small cubes. Wait, but wait, no, maybe not. Because the question is about the small cubes' faces, not the number of cubes. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nWait, the question is about the faces of the small cubes that remain unpainted. So when the outer surface is painted, the small cubes on the surface will have some painted faces, and the inner ones (if any) won't have any painted faces. But wait, the cube is hollow, so perhaps the inner part isn't made of small cubes? Or wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the question again.\n\nWait, the cube is a hollow cube of size 5 cm, thickness 1 cm. So it's like a shell, right? So the walls are 1 cm thick, and the inside is empty. So the small cubes are arranged in a 5x5x5 cube, but the inner 3x3x3 is empty. So the number of small cubes that exist is the outer shell. So that's 5^3 minus 3^3, which is 125 - 27 = 98 small cubes. Each of these is part of the outer structure.\n\nEach of these 98 small cubes is on the surface of the big cube, so some of their faces are painted. The question is, how many of their faces are unpainted.\n\nWait, each small cube can have up to 3 painted faces (if it's at a corner), 2 (if it's on an edge but not a corner), 1 (if it's on a face but not an edge), or 0 (if it's inside, but in this case, there's no inside because the cube is hollow). Wait no, wait, no. Wait, the cube is hollow, so the inner part isn't filled with small cubes. So all the small cubes are on the outer surfaces. So each small cube is either on a corner, edge, or face, but not inside. So all of them have at least one face painted.\n\nWait, no, because the hollow part is empty, so all the small cubes are on the surface. So each of them has at least one face exposed. So, their faces that are on the outside will be painted, and their adjacent faces (if any) that are connected to other small cubes will be unpainted.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the faces of all the small cubes. Each small cube has 6 faces. The ones on the outer surface have some faces painted, the others are covered by adjacent cubes or are on the inside (but in this case, the inside is empty, so perhaps the faces that are inside the big cube but are part of the hollow are not painted.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to approach this differently.\n\nEach small cube on the surface will have some of its faces painted. For each small cube, the number of painted faces depends on its position. For example, a corner cube has 3 painted faces, an edge cube (but not corner) has 2, a face cube (not edge) has 1, and a cube on the inner side but not on the outer face... Wait, but in this case, the cube is hollow, so the inner side isn't there. So all the small cubes are on the exterior, meaning each has at least one face painted. So for each small cube, the number of unpainted faces would be 6 minus the number of painted faces.\n\nSo the total number of unpainted faces is the sum over all small cubes of (6 - number of painted faces per cube).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the total number of small cube faces in the entire structure and subtract the number of painted faces.\n\nEach small cube has 6 faces. There are 98 small cubes, so total faces are 98 * 6 = 588.\n\nBut wait, the big cube's outer surface is painted, so how many faces are painted? The big cube has 6 faces, each 5x5 cm. So each face has 5x5 =25 small cube faces painted. So 6*25=150 painted faces. So the total painted small cube faces are 150.\n\nBut wait, wait, that's not correct because the big cube's faces are 5x5 cm, so each face is 25 small cube faces. So total painted faces are 6*25=150.\n\nSo the total number of painted small cube faces is 150.\n\nSo the unpainted small cube faces would be the total (588) minus 150. So 588 -150 =438.\n\nWait, but that's one of the options, option A is 438. But wait, wait a second. Is that correct?\n\nWait, no, because each small cube's face that is adjacent to another small cube in the same hollow cube is an internal face, which isn't painted. So each internal face between two small cubes is not painted. So perhaps I should subtract the internal faces as well.\n\nWait, but in the initial approach, I subtracted only the painted faces. Wait, the total number of small cube faces is 98 *6 =588. The painted ones are 150. So unpainted would be 588 -150 =438. But maybe that's not correct because each internal face (the ones between two small cubes) is counted twice in the 588 (once for each cube). So perhaps I need to subtract the internal faces as well.\n\nWait, no, because in the problem, the cubes are hollow. So the inner part is empty. So the small cubes only form the outer shell. So, in this case, each small cube that is on the edge, corner, or face is connected to other small cubes on the same face, but their internal faces (the ones that would face the hollow) are not connected to any other cube. So each of these small cubes has some faces that are part of the hollow and thus not painted.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as the hollow cube has walls of 1 cm thickness. Each face of the hollow cube has a 5x5 grid of small cubes. But since it's hollow, the inner 3x3x3 is empty. So the small cubes on each face are arranged in a 5x5 grid, but the inner 3x3 is empty. So for each face, the outer layer is 5x5, and the inner layer is 3x3, so the number of small cubes on each face is (5^2 -3^2) =25-9=16. But wait, that's per face, but each edge and corner is shared between multiple faces.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to calculate the number of small cubes on each face, edge, and corner, and then compute the number of painted and unpainted faces.\n\nLet me think: the hollow cube has 6 faces, each 5x5, but the inner part is 3x3x3. So each face has a 5x5 grid, and the inner 3x3 is empty. So the number of small cubes on each face is 5x5 -3x3= 25-9=16. But wait, each edge and corner is shared between two or three faces. So perhaps the total number of small cubes is more than 6*16, because each edge and corner is counted multiple times.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute the number of small cubes on the surface. The big cube is 5x5x5, and the hollow part is 3x3x3. So the number of small cubes in the hollow cube is 5^3 -3^3 =125-27=98.\n\nSo each of these 98 small cubes is on the surface, and each has at least one face painted.\n\nEach small cube can have 1, 2, or 3 painted faces, depending on its position.\n\nSo the total number of painted faces is the sum of all painted faces of each small cube.\n\nBut perhaps a more efficient way is to compute the number of small cube faces that are painted.\n\nEach face of the big cube is 5x5, so 25 small cube faces. There are 6 faces, so 6*25=150 painted small cube faces.\n\nBut wait, that's exactly what I thought earlier. So the total painted small cube faces are 150.\n\nThe total number of small cube faces is 98 *6 =588.\n\nSo the unpainted small cube faces would be 588-150=438. So option A is 438.\n\nBut wait, wait, the problem is that each small cube's face that's adjacent to another small cube is not painted. So each internal face (between two small cubes) is counted as an unpainted face in the total.\n\nWait, no, because in the hollow cube, each small cube is on the surface. So for each small cube, the faces that are on the inside of the hollow cube (facing the empty space) are not painted. But those are the same as the faces that are adjacent to the hollow. So for each small cube on the surface, how many of their faces are adjacent to the hollow?\n\nWait, in a hollow cube, each small cube on the surface is part of the outer shell. So for each such cube, one face is on the outer surface (painted), and the other faces may be adjacent to other small cubes or to the hollow.\n\nWait, perhaps each small cube on the surface has one face painted, and the other five faces might be adjacent to other small cubes or the hollow. But in reality, some of those five faces are adjacent to other small cubes (so they are internal, unpainted), and the rest are facing the hollow, so also unpainted.\n\nWait, perhaps each small cube on the surface has exactly one face painted, and the remaining five faces are either adjacent to other small cubes or facing the hollow. So the number of painted faces per small cube is one.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because corner cubes would have three painted faces, edge cubes two, and face cubes one.\n\nWait, no, because the cube is hollow, so the small cubes on the edges and corners are still part of the outer surface, so their other faces would be adjacent to other small cubes.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as the total number of small cube faces that are part of the outer surface (painted) plus the internal faces (unpainted, but between small cubes) plus the faces that are part of the hollow (unpainted, facing empty space).\n\nWait, but the problem is only about the small cubes. The hollow part is empty, so any face of a small cube that is part of the hollow is not painted. So each small cube's faces that are part of the hollow are unpainted.\n\nSo, for each small cube, the number of painted faces is the number of faces on the outside. The remaining faces (6 - painted) are either adjacent to other small cubes (unpainted) or facing the hollow (unpainted).\n\nWait, but in this problem, the question is about the number of faces of the small cubes that remain unpainted. So for each small cube, the number of unpainted faces is 6 minus the number of painted faces.\n\nSo if I can find the total number of painted faces across all small cubes, then the unpainted is 98*6 - painted.\n\nEarlier, I thought the painted faces are 150, so 98*6=588, 588-150=438.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because I might have miscounted the painted faces.\n\nWait, let me think again. Each face of the big cube is 5x5, so 25 small cube faces. The big cube has 6 faces, so 6*25=150. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. In the hollow cube, each face is 5x5, but the small cubes on the edges and corners are shared between multiple faces. So when I count the painted faces, I'm not overcounting because each face is a distinct part of the big cube.\n\nSo yes, the total painted small cube faces are 150.\n\nSo the total unpainted faces would be 588-150=438. So the answer is A)438.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option E is 498. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated the number of small cubes. Let me double-check.\n\nThe big cube is 5x5x5, so 125 small cubes. The hollow part is 3x3x3, 27 small cubes. So 125-27=98 small cubes in the hollow structure.\n\nSo each of these 98 has 6 faces, 588 total.\n\nPainted faces: 6*25=150.\n\nSo 588-150=438.\n\nThat would be option A.\n\nBut wait, another approach: think about each small cube's contribution to the unpainted faces.\n\nCorner cubes: each corner cube has 3 painted faces. There are 8 corners in a cube. So each corner cube contributes 6-3=3 unpainted faces. 8 *3=24.\n\nEdge cubes (not corners): each edge has (5-2)=3 small cubes (since the corners are excluded). Each edge has 3 such cubes. There are 12 edges. Each such cube is on an edge and has 2 painted faces. So each contributes 6-2=4 unpainted faces. 12 edges *3 cubes *4= 12*3*4=144.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, each edge has length 5 small cubes. But the two ends are corners. So the number of edge cubes (excluding corners) is 5-2=3 per edge. So 12 edges *3=36 edge cubes.\n\nEach edge cube has 2 painted faces. So their unpainted faces are 6-2=4. So 36 *4=144.\n\nFace centers: each face has (5-2)*(5-2)=3x3=9 small cubes that are on the face but not on edges or corners. Each has 1 painted face. So their unpainted faces are 5. There are 6 faces, so 6*9=54 face center cubes.\n\nEach contributes 5 unpainted faces. 54 *5=270.\n\nSo total unpainted faces would be 24 (corners) +144 (edges) +270 (face centers) = 24+144=168; 168+270=438. So same result as before. So the answer is 438, option A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the hollow cube of size 5 cm (outer dimension) with a thickness of 1 cm. The cube is made of 1 cm\u00b3 smaller cubes, and the outer surface is painted. We need to determine how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted.\n\n### Key Steps:\n1. **Total Small Cubes in the Hollow Cube**:  \n   The hollow cube has an outer dimension of 5 cm, so it contains \\(5^3 = 125\\) smaller cubes. The inner hollow part is a 3 cm cube (since the thickness is 1 cm), containing \\(3^3 = 27\\) smaller cubes.  \n   Therefore, the number of small cubes in the hollow structure is:  \n   \\[\n   125 - 27 = 98\n   \\]\n\n2. **Total Faces of All Small Cubes**:  \n   Each small cube has 6 faces, so the total number of faces for all 98 small cubes is:  \n   \\[\n   98 \\times 6 = 588\n   \\]\n\n3. **Painted Faces**:  \n   The outer surface of the hollow cube is painted. Each face of the cube is a \\(5 \\times 5\\) grid of small cube faces, so there are \\(5^2 = 25\\) painted faces per face of the cube. With 6 faces on the cube, the total number of painted faces is:  \n   \\[\n   6 \\times 25 = 150\n   \\]\n\n4. **Unpainted Faces**:  \n   The total number of unpainted faces is the total faces of all small cubes minus the painted faces:  \n   \\[\n   588 - 150 = 438\n   \\]\n\n### Verification:\nTo verify, we categorize the small cubes based on their positions:\n- **Corner Cubes**: There are 8 corner cubes, each with 3 painted faces. The number of unpainted faces per corner cube is \\(6 - 3 = 3\\). Total unpainted faces for corners:  \n  \\[\n  8 \\times 3 = 24\n  \\]\n- **Edge Cubes (excluding corners)**: Each edge has \\(5 - 2 = 3\\) small cubes (excluding corners). There are 12 edges, so there are \\(12 \\times 3 = 36\\) edge cubes. Each edge cube has 2 painted faces, so the number of unpainted faces per edge cube is \\(6 - 2 = 4\\). Total unpainted faces for edges:  \n  \\[\n  36 \\times 4 = 144\n  \\]\n- **Face Center Cubes**: Each face has a \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) grid of small cubes that are neither on edges nor corners. There are 6 faces, so there are \\(6 \\times 9 = 54\\) face center cubes. Each face center cube has 1 painted face, so the number of unpainted faces per face center cube is \\(6 - 1 = 5\\).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a hollow cube, and I'm supposed to find out how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted after the outer surface is painted. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the cube is hollow, with a size of 5 cm on each side, and each small cube is 1 cm. So, I think the big cube is made up of 5x5x5 smaller cubes. But wait, it's hollow, so the inside isn't filled. Oh right, because it's hollow, the inner part is empty. So the total number of small cubes is 5^3 minus the inner hollow part. The inner hollow would be a cube of size 3 cm, right? Because if the big cube is 5 cm and the walls are 1 cm thick, then each dimension's inner part is 5 - 2*1 = 3 cm. So the inner cube is 3x3x3. So the total small cubes would be 125 (5^3) minus 27 (3^3) which is 98 small cubes. Wait, but wait, no, maybe not. Because the question is about the small cubes' faces, not the number of cubes. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nWait, the question is about the faces of the small cubes that remain unpainted. So when the outer surface is painted, the small cubes on the surface will have some painted faces, and the inner ones (if any) won't have any painted faces. But wait, the cube is hollow, so perhaps the inner part isn't made of small cubes? Or wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the question again.\n\nWait, the cube is a hollow cube of size 5 cm, thickness 1 cm. So it's like a shell, right? So the walls are 1 cm thick, and the inside is empty. So the small cubes are arranged in a 5x5x5 cube, but the inner 3x3x3 is empty. So the number of small cubes that exist is the outer shell. So that's 5^3 minus 3^3, which is 125 - 27 = 98 small cubes. Each of these is part of the outer structure.\n\nEach of these 98 small cubes is on the surface of the big cube, so some of their faces are painted. The question is, how many of their faces are unpainted.\n\nWait, each small cube can have up to 3 painted faces (if it's at a corner), 2 (if it's on an edge but not a corner), 1 (if it's on a face but not an edge), or 0 (if it's inside, but in this case, there's no inside because the cube is hollow). Wait no, wait, no. Wait, the cube is hollow, so the inner part isn't filled with small cubes. So all the small cubes are on the outer surfaces. So each small cube is either on a corner, edge, or face, but not inside. So all of them have at least one face painted.\n\nWait, no, because the hollow part is empty, so all the small cubes are on the surface. So each of them has at least one face exposed. So, their faces that are on the outside will be painted, and their adjacent faces (if any) that are connected to other small cubes will be unpainted.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the faces of all the small cubes. Each small cube has 6 faces. The ones on the outer surface have some faces painted, the others are covered by adjacent cubes or are on the inside (but in this case, the inside is empty, so perhaps the faces that are inside the big cube but are part of the hollow are not painted.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to approach this differently.\n\nEach small cube on the surface will have some of its faces painted. For each small cube, the number of painted faces depends on its position. For example, a corner cube has 3 painted faces, an edge cube (but not corner) has 2, a face cube (not edge) has 1, and a cube on the inner side but not on the outer face... Wait, but in this case, the cube is hollow, so the inner side isn't there. So all the small cubes are on the exterior, meaning each has at least one face painted. So for each small cube, the number of unpainted faces would be 6 minus the number of painted faces.\n\nSo the total number of unpainted faces is the sum over all small cubes of (6 - number of painted faces per cube).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the total number of small cube faces in the entire structure and subtract the number of painted faces.\n\nEach small cube has 6 faces. There are 98 small cubes, so total faces are 98 * 6 = 588.\n\nBut wait, the big cube's outer surface is painted, so how many faces are painted? The big cube has 6 faces, each 5x5 cm. So each face has 5x5 =25 small cube faces painted. So 6*25=150 painted faces. So the total painted small cube faces are 150.\n\nBut wait, wait, that's not correct because the big cube's faces are 5x5 cm, so each face is 25 small cube faces. So total painted faces are 6*25=150.\n\nSo the total number of painted small cube faces is 150.\n\nSo the unpainted small cube faces would be the total (588) minus 150. So 588 -150 =438.\n\nWait, but that's one of the options, option A is 438. But wait, wait a second. Is that correct?\n\nWait, no, because each small cube's face that is adjacent to another small cube in the same hollow cube is an internal face, which isn't painted. So each internal face between two small cubes is not painted. So perhaps I should subtract the internal faces as well.\n\nWait, but in the initial approach, I subtracted only the painted faces. Wait, the total number of small cube faces is 98 *6 =588. The painted ones are 150. So unpainted would be 588 -150 =438. But maybe that's not correct because each internal face (the ones between two small cubes) is counted twice in the 588 (once for each cube). So perhaps I need to subtract the internal faces as well.\n\nWait, no, because in the problem, the cubes are hollow. So the inner part is empty. So the small cubes only form the outer shell. So, in this case, each small cube that is on the edge, corner, or face is connected to other small cubes on the same face, but their internal faces (the ones that would face the hollow) are not connected to any other cube. So each of these small cubes has some faces that are part of the hollow and thus not painted.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as the hollow cube has walls of 1 cm thickness. Each face of the hollow cube has a 5x5 grid of small cubes. But since it's hollow, the inner 3x3x3 is empty. So the small cubes on each face are arranged in a 5x5 grid, but the inner 3x3 is empty. So for each face, the outer layer is 5x5, and the inner layer is 3x3, so the number of small cubes on each face is (5^2 -3^2) =25-9=16. But wait, that's per face, but each edge and corner is shared between multiple faces.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to calculate the number of small cubes on each face, edge, and corner, and then compute the number of painted and unpainted faces.\n\nLet me think: the hollow cube has 6 faces, each 5x5, but the inner part is 3x3x3. So each face has a 5x5 grid, and the inner 3x3 is empty. So the number of small cubes on each face is 5x5 -3x3= 25-9=16. But wait, each edge and corner is shared between two or three faces. So perhaps the total number of small cubes is more than 6*16, because each edge and corner is counted multiple times.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute the number of small cubes on the surface. The big cube is 5x5x5, and the hollow part is 3x3x3. So the number of small cubes in the hollow cube is 5^3 -3^3 =125-27=98.\n\nSo each of these 98 small cubes is on the surface, and each has at least one face painted.\n\nEach small cube can have 1, 2, or 3 painted faces, depending on its position.\n\nSo the total number of painted faces is the sum of all painted faces of each small cube.\n\nBut perhaps a more efficient way is to compute the number of small cube faces that are painted.\n\nEach face of the big cube is 5x5, so 25 small cube faces. There are 6 faces, so 6*25=150 painted small cube faces.\n\nBut wait, that's exactly what I thought earlier. So the total painted small cube faces are 150.\n\nThe total number of small cube faces is 98 *6 =588.\n\nSo the unpainted small cube faces would be 588-150=438. So option A is 438.\n\nBut wait, wait, the problem is that each small cube's face that's adjacent to another small cube is not painted. So each internal face (between two small cubes) is counted as an unpainted face in the total.\n\nWait, no, because in the hollow cube, each small cube is on the surface. So for each small cube, the faces that are on the inside of the hollow cube (facing the empty space) are not painted. But those are the same as the faces that are adjacent to the hollow. So for each small cube on the surface, how many of their faces are adjacent to the hollow?\n\nWait, in a hollow cube, each small cube on the surface is part of the outer shell. So for each such cube, one face is on the outer surface (painted), and the other faces may be adjacent to other small cubes or to the hollow.\n\nWait, perhaps each small cube on the surface has one face painted, and the other five faces might be adjacent to other small cubes or the hollow. But in reality, some of those five faces are adjacent to other small cubes (so they are internal, unpainted), and the rest are facing the hollow, so also unpainted.\n\nWait, perhaps each small cube on the surface has exactly one face painted, and the remaining five faces are either adjacent to other small cubes or facing the hollow. So the number of painted faces per small cube is one.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because corner cubes would have three painted faces, edge cubes two, and face cubes one.\n\nWait, no, because the cube is hollow, so the small cubes on the edges and corners are still part of the outer surface, so their other faces would be adjacent to other small cubes.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as the total number of small cube faces that are part of the outer surface (painted) plus the internal faces (unpainted, but between small cubes) plus the faces that are part of the hollow (unpainted, facing empty space).\n\nWait, but the problem is only about the small cubes. The hollow part is empty, so any face of a small cube that is part of the hollow is not painted. So each small cube's faces that are part of the hollow are unpainted.\n\nSo, for each small cube, the number of painted faces is the number of faces on the outside. The remaining faces (6 - painted) are either adjacent to other small cubes (unpainted) or facing the hollow (unpainted).\n\nWait, but in this problem, the question is about the number of faces of the small cubes that remain unpainted. So for each small cube, the number of unpainted faces is 6 minus the number of painted faces.\n\nSo if I can find the total number of painted faces across all small cubes, then the unpainted is 98*6 - painted.\n\nEarlier, I thought the painted faces are 150, so 98*6=588, 588-150=438.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because I might have miscounted the painted faces.\n\nWait, let me think again. Each face of the big cube is 5x5, so 25 small cube faces. The big cube has 6 faces, so 6*25=150. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. In the hollow cube, each face is 5x5, but the small cubes on the edges and corners are shared between multiple faces. So when I count the painted faces, I'm not overcounting because each face is a distinct part of the big cube.\n\nSo yes, the total painted small cube faces are 150.\n\nSo the total unpainted faces would be 588-150=438. So the answer is A)438.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option E is 498. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated the number of small cubes. Let me double-check.\n\nThe big cube is 5x5x5, so 125 small cubes. The hollow part is 3x3x3, 27 small cubes. So 125-27=98 small cubes in the hollow structure.\n\nSo each of these 98 has 6 faces, 588 total.\n\nPainted faces: 6*25=150.\n\nSo 588-150=438.\n\nThat would be option A.\n\nBut wait, another approach: think about each small cube's contribution to the unpainted faces.\n\nCorner cubes: each corner cube has 3 painted faces. There are 8 corners in a cube. So each corner cube contributes 6-3=3 unpainted faces. 8 *3=24.\n\nEdge cubes (not corners): each edge has (5-2)=3 small cubes (since the corners are excluded). Each edge has 3 such cubes. There are 12 edges. Each such cube is on an edge and has 2 painted faces. So each contributes 6-2=4 unpainted faces. 12 edges *3 cubes *4= 12*3*4=144.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, each edge has length 5 small cubes. But the two ends are corners. So the number of edge cubes (excluding corners) is 5-2=3 per edge. So 12 edges *3=36 edge cubes.\n\nEach edge cube has 2 painted faces. So their unpainted faces are 6-2=4. So 36 *4=144.\n\nFace centers: each face has (5-2)*(5-2)=3x3=9 small cubes that are on the face but not on edges or corners. Each has 1 painted face. So their unpainted faces are 5. There are 6 faces, so 6*9=54 face center cubes.\n\nEach contributes 5 unpainted faces. 54 *5=270.\n\nSo total unpainted faces would be 24 (corners) +144 (edges) +270 (face centers) = 24+144=168; 168+270=438. So same result as before. So the answer is 438, option A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the hollow cube of size 5 cm (outer dimension) with a thickness of 1 cm. The cube is made of 1 cm\u00b3 smaller cubes, and the outer surface is painted. We need to determine how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted.\n\n### Key Steps:\n1. **Total Small Cubes in the Hollow Cube**:  \n   The hollow cube has an outer dimension of 5 cm, so it contains \\(5^3 = 125\\) smaller cubes. The inner hollow part is a 3 cm cube (since the thickness is 1 cm), containing \\(3^3 = 27\\) smaller cubes.  \n   Therefore, the number of small cubes in the hollow structure is:  \n   \\[\n   125 - 27 = 98\n   \\]\n\n2. **Total Faces of All Small Cubes**:  \n   Each small cube has 6 faces, so the total number of faces for all 98 small cubes is:  \n   \\[\n   98 \\times 6 = 588\n   \\]\n\n3. **Painted Faces**:  \n   The outer surface of the hollow cube is painted. Each face of the cube is a \\(5 \\times 5\\) grid of small cube faces, so there are \\(5^2 = 25\\) painted faces per face of the cube. With 6 faces on the cube, the total number of painted faces is:  \n   \\[\n   6 \\times 25 = 150\n   \\]\n\n4. **Unpainted Faces**:  \n   The total number of unpainted faces is the total faces of all small cubes minus the painted faces:  \n   \\[\n   588 - 150 = 438\n   \\]\n\n### Verification:\nTo verify, we categorize the small cubes based on their positions:\n- **Corner Cubes**: There are 8 corner cubes, each with 3 painted faces. The number of unpainted faces per corner cube is \\(6 - 3 = 3\\). Total unpainted faces for corners:  \n  \\[\n  8 \\times 3 = 24\n  \\]\n- **Edge Cubes (excluding corners)**: Each edge has \\(5 - 2 = 3\\) small cubes (excluding corners). There are 12 edges, so there are \\(12 \\times 3 = 36\\) edge cubes. Each edge cube has 2 painted faces, so the number of unpainted faces per edge cube is \\(6 - 2 = 4\\). Total unpainted faces for edges:  \n  \\[\n  36 \\times 4 = 144\n  \\]\n- **Face Center Cubes**: Each face has a \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) grid of small cubes that are neither on edges nor corners. There are 6 faces, so there are \\(6 \\times 9 = 54\\) face center cubes. Each face center cube has 1 painted face, so the number of unpainted faces per face center cube is \\(6 - 1 = 5\\). Total unpainted faces for face centers:  \n  \\[\n  54 \\times 5 = 270\n  \\]\n\nAdding these contributions:  \n\\[\n24 + 144 + 270 = 438\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of unpainted faces is **438**, which matches the earlier calculation.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is **438**.\n\nANSWER: A",
