      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about estimating the deer population in a forest. Hmm, I think this is a capture-recapture problem. Let me try to remember how that works. I think the idea is that you capture a certain number of animals, tag them, release them back, and then later capture another sample to see how many are tagged. From that, you can estimate the total population.\n\nAlright, so the details: In 2001, they caught 300 deer, tagged them, and let them go. Then in 2002, they caught 500 deer randomly, and out of those, 20 were tagged. The question is about finding the total deer population in the forest, assuming the population hasn't changed between 2001 and 2002.\n\nWait, I remember the formula for capture-recapture. I think it's something like (number tagged in first capture) divided by (total population) equals (number tagged in second capture) divided by (total captured in second time). Or maybe it's the proportion of tagged in the second sample equals the proportion in the whole population.\n\nWait, more accurately, the Lincoln-Petersen estimator. The formula is: N = (number tagged in first capture * total number captured in second capture) / number recaptured in second capture.\n\nSo, N = (M * C) / R, where M is the number marked initially, C is the total number captured in the second time, and R is the number recaptured.\n\nIn this problem, M is 300. C is 500. R is 20.\n\nSo plugging those numbers in: N = (300 * 500) / 20. Let me calculate that. 300 times 500 is 150,000. Divided by 20, that's 7,500. So N would be 7,500.\n\nWait, but let me think again. So the idea is that the proportion of tagged deer in the second sample should reflect the proportion in the entire population. So 20 out of 500 in the second sample. That's 4% (since 20/500 is 0.04). So if 4% of the entire population is tagged, then the total population N would be 300 (the number tagged initially) divided by 0.04.\n\nWait, 300 divided by 0.04 is 7,500. Oh yeah, same result. So that makes sense.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 7500. So the correct answer should be E.\n\nWait, but why isn't it 300 multiplied by 25? Oh wait, because 20 is 4% of 500, so the total population would be 300 divided by 4% which is 7500. Yeah, that's right.\n\nSo the answer should be E)7500.\n",

So the formula is N \u2248 (M * C) / R, where M is the number marked initially, C is the total caught in the second sample, and R is the number recaptured.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. M is 300, C is 500, R is 20. So N would be (300 * 500) / 20. Let me calculate that. 300 times 500 is 150,000. Divided by 20 is 7,500. So N would be 7500. Wait, but is that right?\n\nWait, does this make sense? Because if the population is 7500, then the 300 tagged deer would be about 4% of the population. In the second capture, 500 deer, 4% would be 20, which matches the data. Yeah, that seems to fit.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 7500. So the answer should be E.\n\nBut wait, are there any other considerations? Oh, the problem states that the percentage in the sample is representative of the total. So the Lincoln-Petersen method is exactly what's being applied here. So I think the calculation is correct.\n\n\nTo estimate the total deer population in the forest, the Lincoln-Petersen mark-recapture method is used. The formula for this method is:\n\n\\[\nN \\approx \\frac{M \\cdot C}{R}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( M \\) is the number of deer tagged in the first year (300),\n- \\( C \\) is the total number of deer caught in the second year (500),\n- \\( R \\) is the number of tagged deer recaptured in the second year (20).\n\nSubstituting the values into the formula:\n\n\\[\nN = \\frac{300 \\cdot 500}{20}\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( 300 \\cdot 500 = 150,000 \\). Then divide by 20:\n\n\\[\nN = \\frac{150,000}{20} = 7,500\n\\]\n\nThis means the estimated total deer population in the forest is 7,500. The calculation aligns with the assumption that the percentage of tagged deer in the sample is representative of the overall population. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: E**",

Then in 2002, they caught 500 deer randomly, and out of those, 20 were tagged. The question says that the percentage of tagged deer in the sample is representative of the total population. So I guess I can use that proportion to estimate the total population.\n\nWait, how does that work again? Oh right, the idea is that the proportion of tagged deer in the second sample should reflect the proportion of tagged deer in the entire population. So if 20 out of 500 were tagged in the second capture, that's 4% tagged (since 20/500 is 0.04). So that 4% should be the same as the proportion of tagged deer in the whole population.\n\nBut wait, the number of tagged deer in the whole population is the 300 that were tagged in the first capture. So let me set that up. Let N be the total population. The proportion of tagged deer is 300/N. And according to the capture-recapture model, this should equal the proportion found in the second sample, which is 20/500.\n\nSo equation: 300/N = 20/500.\n\nLet me solve for N. Cross-multiplying: 300 * 500 = 20 * N. So 150000 = 20N. Divide both sides by 20: N=150000/20=7500.\n\nWait, but wait. Oh, wait a second. I think I might have mixed up the formula. I remember another version where it's (number tagged in first capture) divided by (total population) equals (number recaptured in second) divided by (total caught in second). So yeah, that's exactly what I did.\n\nSo N would be 7500. Looking at the options, option E is 7500. So the answer must be E.\n\nBut wait, another thought. Sometimes people use a different formula where you take the total number captured both times, but I don't think that applies here.

So I guess I can use that proportion to estimate the total population.\n\nWait, how does that work again? Oh right, the idea is that the proportion of tagged deer in the second sample should reflect the proportion of tagged deer in the entire population. So if 20 out of 500 were tagged in the second capture, that's 4% tagged (since 20/500 is 0.04). So that 4% should be the same as the proportion of tagged deer in the whole population.\n\nBut wait, the number of tagged deer in the whole population is the 300 that were tagged in the first capture. So let me set that up. Let N be the total population. The proportion of tagged deer is 300/N. And according to the capture-recapture model, this should equal the proportion found in the second sample, which is 20/500.\n\nSo equation: 300/N = 20/500.\n\nLet me solve for N. Cross-multiplying: 300 * 500 = 20 * N. So 150000 = 20N. Divide both sides by 20: N=150000/20=7500.\n\nWait, but wait. Oh, wait a second. I think I might have mixed up the formula. I remember another version where it's (number tagged in first capture) divided by (total population) equals (number recaptured in second) divided by (total caught in second). So yeah, that's exactly what I did.\n\nSo N would be 7500. Looking at the options, option E is 7500. So the answer must be E.\n\nBut wait, another thought. Sometimes people use a different formula where you take the total number captured both times, but I don't think that applies here. Because in the Lincoln-Petersen estimator, the formula is N \u2248 (M * C) / R, where M is the number marked initially, C is the total caught in the second time, and R is the number recaptured.\n\nPlugging the numbers: M=300, C=500, R=20.\n\nSo N \u2248 (300 * 500) / 20 = 150000 / 20 =7500. Yep, that's the same result. So definitely E.\n\n\nTo estimate the total deer population in the forest, we use the capture-recapture method. In 2001, 300 deer were tagged and released. In 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, and 20 of them were found to be tagged. The proportion of tagged deer in the second sample (20/500 = 0.04) is assumed to represent the proportion of tagged deer in the entire population.\n\nLet \\( N \\) be the total deer population. The proportion of tagged deer in the population is \\( \\frac{300}{N} \\), and this should equal the proportion of tagged deer in the second sample, \\( \\frac{20}{500} \\). Setting up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{300}{N} = \\frac{20}{500}\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\n\\[\n300 \\times 500 = 20 \\times N\n\\]\n\n\\[\n150,000 = 20N\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 20:\n\n\\[\nN = \\frac{150,000}{20} = 7,500\n\\]\n\nThus, the total deer population in the forest is estimated to be 7,500.
