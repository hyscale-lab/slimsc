      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem is about an organization collecting contributions from its employees. \n\nAlright, the problem says the organization wants to raise Rs. 6 lakh. Each employee contributes equally. So, if each employee had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the total would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. I need to find out how many employees there are.\n\nWait, let me make sure I understand. So initially, each employee contributes a certain amount, let's say x rupees. The total contribution from all employees is 6 lakh. Then, if each contributes 60 rupees more, the total becomes 6.24 lakh. So, the difference between these two totals is 0.24 lakh, which is 24,000 rupees.\n\nWait, right. Because 6.24 lakh minus 6 lakh is 0.24 lakh, which is 24,000. So, the extra contribution per employee is 60 rupees, and the total extra is 24,000. So, the number of employees must be 24,000 divided by 60. Let me calculate that.\n\n24,000 divided by 60 is... 24,000 \u00f7 60 = 400. So, 400 employees. So the answer should be option C) 400.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me set up the equations properly.\n\nLet me denote the number of employees as N and the original contribution per employee as x.\n\nSo, the first condition is N * x = 6,00,000 (since 6 lakh is 600,000). \n\nThe second condition is that each contributes Rs. 60 more, so each contributes (x +60). The total then is N*(x +60) = 624,000 (since 6.24 lakh is 624,000).\n\nSo, subtracting the first equation from the second: N*(x +60) - N*x = 624,000 - 600,000. \n\nSimplifying the left side: N*x +60N - Nx = 60N. So 60N = 24,000. \n\nDivide both sides by 60: N = 24,000 /60 = 400. Yep, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nSo the number of employees is 400. Looking back at the options, option C is 400. So the answer should be C.\n",

If each employee had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the total would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. The question is, how many employees are there?\n\nHmm, I think I can set up an equation here. Let me think about the variables. Let's say the number of employees is N. And each employee contributes X rupees. So, the total contribution would be N multiplied by X, right?\n\nSo initially, N * X = 6,00,000. Because they want to raise 6 lakh rupees.\n\nBut then, if each contributes Rs. 60 more, each person gives X + 60. So the new total contribution is N*(X + 60) = 6,24,000. Because the total becomes 6.24 lakh.\n\nWait, so now I have two equations:\n\n1. N * X = 6,00,000\n2. N * (X + 60) = 6,24,000\n\nI can subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to find the difference.

So N times 60 equals 24,000.\n\nSo N = 24,000 / 60. Let me calculate that. 24,000 divided by 60 is... 24,000 divided by 60 is 400? Because 60 times 400 is 24,000. Wait, no, wait. 60 * 400 is 24,000?

Let me calculate that. 6,00,000 divided by 400 is 1,500. So each person contributes 1,500 initially.\n\nIf each contributes 60 more, that's 1,560. Multiply by 400: 1,560 * 400. Let me compute that. 1,500 *400 is 6,00,000, and 60*400 is 24,000. So total is 6,24,000. Which matches the second condition. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer is 400 employees.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The problem says that an organization wants to raise Rs. 6 lakh by getting equal contributions from each employee. Then, if each employee contributed Rs. 60 more, the total would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. I need to find out how many employees there are.\n\nHmm, let me break it down. So, let's denote the number of employees as 'n' and the original contribution per employee as 'x'. So, the initial total contribution is n multiplied by x, and that equals 6 lakh. So, the equation would be n * x = 600,000.\n\nNow, if each employee contributes Rs. 60 extra, then the new contribution per employee becomes x + 60. And the total contribution then is n multiplied by (x + 60), which equals 6.24 lakh. So the second equation is n*(x+60) = 624,000.\n\nWait, so I have two equations here:\n1. n*x = 600,000\n2. n*(x +60) = 624,000\n\nI can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate n*x. Let's see, equation 2 minus equation 1 gives n*(x+60) - n*x = 624,000 - 600,000. Simplifying that, the x terms cancel out. So n*60 = 24,000.\n\nSo, 60n = 24,000. To find n, I can divide both sides by 60. So n = 24,000 / 60. Let's compute that. 24,000 divided by 60. 60 goes into 240 four times, so 24000 /60 is 400. Oh wait, 60 * 400 is 24,000.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The problem says that an organization wants to raise Rs. 6 lakh by getting equal contributions from each employee. Then, if each employee contributed Rs. 60 more, the total would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. I need to find out how many employees there are.\n\nHmm, let me break it down. So, let's denote the number of employees as 'n' and the original contribution per employee as 'x'. So, the initial total contribution is n multiplied by x, and that equals 6 lakh. So, the equation would be n * x = 600,000.\n\nNow, if each employee contributes Rs. 60 extra, then the new contribution per employee becomes x + 60. And the total contribution then is n multiplied by (x + 60), which equals 6.24 lakh. So the second equation is n*(x+60) = 624,000.\n\nWait, so I have two equations here:\n1. n*x = 600,000\n2. n*(x +60) = 624,000\n\nI can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate n*x. Let's see, equation 2 minus equation 1 gives n*(x+60) - n*x = 624,000 - 600,000. Simplifying that, the x terms cancel out. So n*60 = 24,000.\n\nSo, 60n = 24,000. To find n, I can divide both sides by 60. So n = 24,000 / 60. Let's compute that. 24,000 divided by 60. 60 goes into 240 four times, so 24000 /60 is 400. Oh wait, 60 * 400 is 24,000. So n is 400.\n\nWait, but let me check the options. The options are A)300, B)200, C)400, D)100, E)500. So option C is 400. That seems right.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let's plug it back. If there are 400 employees, original contribution per employee is 600,000 /400 = 1500 Rs. If each contributes 60 more, that's 1560. Then total is 400 *1560. Let me calculate that: 400 *1500 is 600,000, and 400 *60 is 24,000, so total is 624,000, which matches the second condition. Yep, that works.\n\nSo the answer should be option C)400.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the number of employees in an organization based on their contributions.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about an organization raising money through employee contributions. Hmm, let me see. The question is asking for the number of employees, right? Let's break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, the organization wants to raise Rs. 6 lakh. They're collecting equal contributions from each employee. So, if I let the number of employees be N and the amount each contributes be X, then the total contribution would be N multiplied by X. That makes sense because each person gives X, and there are N people.\n\nSo the first equation I can write is N * X = 6,00,000. Because 6 lakh is 600,000. Got that down.\n\nNow, the second part says that if each employee had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the total would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. Oh, wait, 6.24 lakh is 624,000. So the new contribution per employee is X + 60, and the total becomes N*(X +60) = 624,000.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n1. N*X = 600,000\n2. N*(X +60) = 624,000\n\nHmm, I can probably subtract the first equation from the second to find something useful. Let's see, subtract equation 1 from equation 2.\n\nN*(X +60) - N*X = 624,000 - 600,000\nWhich simplifies to N*60 = 24,000.\n\nOh, right, because the X terms cancel out. So N *60 =24,000. Now I can solve for N.\n\nDividing both sides by 60: N = 24,000 /60.\n\nWait, 24,000 divided by 60. Let's calculate that. 60 times 400 is 24,000, because 60*400 is 24,000. So N is 400.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check the calculations. Because 60 times 400 is indeed 24,000. So N equals 400. So the number of employees is 400.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is 400. So that's the answer.\n\n\nLet the number of employees be \\( N \\) and the contribution per employee be \\( X \\). The total contribution is given by:\n\n\\[\nN \\cdot X = 600,000 \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\nIf each employee contributed Rs. 60 extra, the total contribution becomes:\n\n\\[\nN \\cdot (X + 60) = 624,000 \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\nSubtracting equation (1) from equation (2):\n\n\\[\nN \\cdot (X + 60) - N \\cdot X = 624,000 - 600,000\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\nN \\cdot 60 = 24,000\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( N \\):\n\n\\[\nN = \\frac{24,000}{60} = 400\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of employees is 400.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to solve this problem. Hmm, so the organization wants to raise Rs. 6 lakh by getting equal contributions from each employee. Wait, 6 lakh is 600,000 rupees, right? So if each employee contributes a certain amount, say x rupees, and there are n employees, then the total contribution is x * n = 600,000.\n\nBut then there's another condition: if each employee had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the total would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. Oh, wait, 6.24 lakh is 624,000. So in that case, each employee contributes x + 60, and the total is (x + 60) * n = 624,000.\n\nSo I have two equations here. The first is x * n = 600,000. The second is (x + 60) * n = 624,000.\n\nHmm, maybe I can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate some variables. Let me try that. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives:\n\n(x + 60)*n - x*n = 624,000 - 600,000.\n\nSimplifying that, the x terms cancel out. So 60 * n = 24,000.\n\nOh, wait, so 60n = 24,000. Then n = 24,000 / 60. Let me calculate that. 24,000 divided by 60. 60 goes into 24,000 how many times? 60 * 400 is 24,000, so n is 400.\n\nWait, so the number of employees is 400? Let me check the options. Option C is 400. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should verify using the first equation. If n is 400, then x = 600,000 / 400 = 1500. So each employee contributes 1500 rupees. If they contribute 60 more, that's 1560 each. Multiply by 400: 1560 * 400. Let me compute that. 1500 *400 is 600,000, and 60*400 is 24,000, so total is 624,000. Yep, that matches the second condition.\n\nSo the answer should be option C, 400 employees.\n",
