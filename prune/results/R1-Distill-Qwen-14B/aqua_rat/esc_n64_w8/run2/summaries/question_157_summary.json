      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question says: In a survey of students, each student selected from a list of 10 songs the 2 songs that the student liked best. If each song was selected 5 times, how many students were surveyed?\n\nHmm. So each student picks 2 songs, and each song was chosen 5 times in total. I need to find the number of students.\n\nWait, let me think. So each student contributes to the count of two songs. For example, if a student likes song A and song B, then both A and B get one more selection each.\n\nNow, there are 10 songs in total, and each was selected 5 times. So the total number of selections across all songs is 10 songs multiplied by 5 selections each. Let me calculate that: 10 *5 = 50. So there were 50 total song selections.\n\nBut each student makes 2 selections. So if I let the number of students be N, then the total selections would be 2*N. Because each student contributes 2 to the total.\n\nSo 2*N = 50. Therefore, N = 50 / 2 = 25 students.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Each song is selected 5 times, so 10 songs times 5 is 50. Each student picks 2, so 50 divided by 2 is 25. That seems right.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 25. So that must be the answer.\n\nWait, did I miss anything? Let me think again. Each student selects exactly 2 songs, no more, no less. Each of those songs counts once towards their selection. So the total number of song selections is 2*N. And that equals the sum of all the times each song was selected, which is 5*10=50. So N is 25. Yes, that makes sense.\n",

If each song was selected 5 times, how many students were surveyed?\n\nHmm, so each student picks 2 songs from 10. And each song was selected 5 times in total. I need to find the number of students.\n\nWait, so each song is liked by 5 students? Or each song is selected 5 times across all students? Oh, I think it's the latter. So every single one of the 10 songs was chosen 5 times by the students. That makes sense.\n\nSo, let's break this down. Each student selects 2 songs. So for each student, they contribute 2 song selections. So if there are N students, the total number of song selections is 2*N.\n\nOn the other side, each of the 10 songs is selected 5 times. So the total number of song selections is 10 * 5 = 50.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because each song is picked 5 times, and there are 10 songs, so 5*10=50 total song choices.\n\nBut each student contributes 2 choices. So the total song choices (50) must equal 2 times the number of students. So 2*N = 50. Solving for N, we get N=25.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is 25. So that would be the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Because sometimes these problems can have a trick. For example, maybe each student selects two different songs, but the problem doesn't say anything about that, so I think it's allowed for a student to select the same song twice? Or wait, no, because each student selects the 2 songs they liked best. So I think each student picks two distinct songs. So each selection is two unique songs per student.\n\nBut wait, the total number of song selections is 2N. Each song is selected 5 times, so 10*5=50. So 2N=50 \u2192 N=25.

I need to find out how many students were surveyed. Hmm, let's see.\n\nWait, each student picks two songs. So for each student, they add two selections. But the total number of times each song is selected is 5. Oh right, because each song was selected 5 times in total.\n\nWait, so if there are 10 songs, and each was chosen 5 times, then the total number of song selections across all students is 10 * 5 = 50. Because each song contributes 5 to the total count.\n\nBut each student contributes 2 song selections. So the total number of students would be the total song selections divided by 2. Because 2 per student.\n\nSo 50 divided by 2 is 25. So there are 25 students.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Each student picks two songs. So for each student, two entries. If each song is picked 5 times, 10 songs times 5 is 50. 50 divided by 2 is 25. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nLooking at the options, D is 25. So the answer should be D.\n",

Let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says that each student selected two songs from a list of 10. So every student picks exactly two songs. Now, each song was selected 5 times. Hmm, I need to find out how many students were surveyed.\n\nWait, so each song was picked 5 times. There are 10 songs in total. Let me think about how this relates to the number of students.\n\nEach student picks two songs, so each student contributes to two song counts. So for every student, two songs are counted. So if I let N be the number of students, then the total number of song selections is 2*N. Because each student makes two choices.\n\nBut each song was selected 5 times. Since there are 10 songs, the total number of times all songs were selected is 10 *5 =50. Because each of the 10 songs was chosen 5 times.\n\nSo 2*N = 50?
