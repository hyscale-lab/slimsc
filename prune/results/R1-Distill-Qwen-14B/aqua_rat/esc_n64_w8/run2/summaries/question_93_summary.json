      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about two balls rotating around a circular track. The question is asking when they'll both be back at the starting point again. Hmm, I remember something about least common multiples from math class. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. Oh wait, so I should find out how long it takes Ball A to complete one rotation. Since 2 rotations take 26 minutes, one rotation would be 26 divided by 2. Let me calculate that: 26 / 2 is 13. So, Ball A takes 13 minutes per rotation.\n\nNext, Ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes. So similarly, each rotation for B takes 35 divided by 5. 35 /5 is 7. So Ball B's rotation time is 7 minutes per rotation.\n\nNow, the question is when they'll both be back at the starting point again. That means I need to find the time when both have completed an integer number of rotations, bringing them back to the start. So, the time we're looking for is the least common multiple (LCM) of their rotation periods.\n\nWait, wait. Let me make sure I get this right. The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both. So in this case, the rotation periods are 13 and 7 minutes. Are 13 and 7 both prime numbers? Yes, because 13 is a prime and 7 is also a prime. So their LCM would be their product, right? Because primes have no common factors except 1. So 13 *7 is 91. So the LCM is 91 minutes.\n\nBut wait, the options are given in hours and minutes. So I need to convert 91 minutes into hours. Let's see, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So 91 minus 60 is 31, so that's 1 hour and 31 minutes.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 1 hour and 31 minutes. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Another way to think about it is: when will both have made whole number of rotations so they're back at the start.\n\nBall A's period is 13 minutes. So the times it's at start are 13, 26, 39, 52, 65, 78, 91, etc. minutes.\n\nBall B's period is 7 minutes, so it's at start at 7,14,21,28,35,42,49,56,63,70,77,84,91, etc.\n\nLooking for the first common time after zero. The first is 91 minutes, which is 1 hour and 31 minutes. Yep, that's correct.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where two balls, A and B, are rotating around a circular track. I need to find out when they'll both be back at their starting point at the same time again. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nAlright, let's break down the information given. Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. So, what's the time it takes for Ball A to complete one rotation? Well, if 2 rotations take 26 minutes, then one rotation would be 26 divided by 2. Let me calculate that: 26 / 2 is 13. So, Ball A takes 13 minutes per full rotation.\n\nThen there's Ball B. It makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes. So, similar to Ball A, the time per rotation for B is 35 divided by 5. That gives me 7. So Ball B takes 7 minutes per rotation.\n\nWait, so now I have their individual periods: Ball A is 13 minutes, Ball B is 7 minutes. I think what I'm looking for is the least common multiple (LCM) of these two periods because that's when both balls will be back at the starting point simultaneously.\n\nRight, the LCM of 13 and 7. Well, 13 and 7 are both prime numbers, right? So the LCM of two primes is just their product. 13 multiplied by 7 is 91. So the LCM is 91 minutes. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Are their periods 13 and 7 minutes? Because sometimes when dealing with rotations, especially circular ones, the time to meet again could be different if they're going in opposite directions or something, but the problem doesn't specify that. So I think it's safe to assume they're moving in the same direction, and we just need to find when they both complete an integer number of rotations and meet again.\n\nSo 91 minutes is the time when both are back. Now, I need to convert 91 minutes into hours and minutes because the options are in that format. \n\nLet me calculate: 60 minutes is 1 hour. So 91 minutes is 1 hour and 31 minutes because 91 minus 60 is 31. So 1 hour and 31 minutes.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 1 hour and 31 minutes. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Did I compute the periods correctly? Ball A: 2 rotations in 26 minutes \u2192 13 minutes per rotation.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where two balls, A and B, are rotating around a circular track. I need to find out when they'll both be back at their starting point at the same time again. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nAlright, let's break down the information given. Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. So, what's the time it takes for Ball A to complete one rotation? Well, if 2 rotations take 26 minutes, then one rotation would be 26 divided by 2. Let me calculate that: 26 / 2 is 13. So, Ball A takes 13 minutes per full rotation.\n\nThen there's Ball B. It makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes. So, similar to Ball A, the time per rotation for B is 35 divided by 5. That gives me 7. So Ball B takes 7 minutes per rotation.\n\nWait, so now I have their individual periods: Ball A is 13 minutes, Ball B is 7 minutes. I think what I'm looking for is the least common multiple (LCM) of these two periods because that's when both balls will be back at the starting point simultaneously.\n\nRight, the LCM of 13 and 7. Well, 13 and 7 are both prime numbers, right? So the LCM of two primes is just their product. 13 multiplied by 7 is 91. So the LCM is 91 minutes. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Are their periods 13 and 7 minutes? Because sometimes when dealing with rotations, especially circular ones, the time to meet again could be different if they're going in opposite directions or something, but the problem doesn't specify that. So I think it's safe to assume they're moving in the same direction, and we just need to find when they both complete an integer number of rotations and meet again.\n\nSo 91 minutes is the time when both are back. Now, I need to convert 91 minutes into hours and minutes because the options are in that format. \n\nLet me calculate: 60 minutes is 1 hour. So 91 minutes is 1 hour and 31 minutes because 91 minus 60 is 31. So 1 hour and 31 minutes.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 1 hour and 31 minutes. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Did I compute the periods correctly? Ball A: 2 rotations in 26 minutes \u2192 13 minutes per rotation. Ball B: 5 rotations in 35 minutes \u2192 7 minutes per rotation. Yes, that's correct. And LCM of 13 and 7 is 91. So yes, 91 minutes is 1h31m. So the answer should be option A.\n\n\nTo determine when both balls A and B will return to their starting point simultaneously, we first calculate their rotational periods. Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes, so its period is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Period of A} = \\frac{26}{2} = 13 \\, \\text{minutes per rotation}.\n\\]\n\nBall B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes, so its period is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Period of B} = \\frac{35}{5} = 7 \\, \\text{minutes per rotation}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the least common multiple (LCM) of their periods, 13 and 7. Since both numbers are prime, their LCM is their product:\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(13, 7) = 13 \\times 7 = 91 \\, \\text{minutes}.\n\\]\n\nTo express 91 minutes in hours and minutes:\n\n\\[\n91 \\, \\text{minutes} = 1 \\, \\text{hour and } 31 \\, \\text{minutes}.\n\\]\n\nThus, both balls will return to their starting point simultaneously after 1 hour and 31 minutes.

Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. Ball B makes 5 in 35 minutes. So I think I need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their periods, right? Because the LCM would give the first time they both complete an integer number of rotations and return to the start.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure. The periods are the time each takes to make one full rotation. So for Ball A, if it takes 26 minutes for 2 rotations, then the time for one rotation is 26/2 = 13 minutes. So period of A is 13 minutes per rotation.\n\nBall B: 5 rotations in 35 minutes. So one rotation is 35/5 = 7 minutes. So period of B is 7 minutes.\n\nWait, wait, no, wait. Wait a second.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about two balls rotating around a circular track. Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes, and Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes. They start at the same point, and I need to find out when they'll both be back at that starting point again. Hmm, sounds like a problem involving least common multiples or something similar.\n\nWait, right, this is probably about finding the least common multiple (LCM) of their rotation periods. Because the LCM would give me the first time they both complete an integer number of rotations and end up back at the starting point simultaneously.\n\nSo first, I think I should find out how long each ball takes to make one full rotation. For Ball A, it makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes. So the time per rotation for A is 26 minutes divided by 2, which is 13 minutes per rotation. Oh wait, no, that's not right. Wait, if 2 rotations take 26 minutes, then one rotation is 26 / 2 = 13 minutes. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nFor Ball B, it makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes. So each rotation takes 35 / 5 = 7 minutes. Okay, so A takes 13 minutes per rotation, B takes 7 minutes.\n\nWait, but we're looking for when they're both back at the starting point again. So that would be when the time elapsed is a multiple of both their rotation periods. So I need the LCM of 13 and 7.\n\nWait, wait, but 13 and 7 are both prime numbers, right? So their LCM is just 13 * 7 = 91 minutes. So 91 minutes is the time when they'll both be back at the starting point.\n\nWait, but 91 minutes is how many hours? Let me think. 60 minutes is 1 hour, so 91 minus 60 is 31, so that's 1 hour and 31 minutes. So the answer would be option A, which is 1 hour and 31 minutes.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Are there any other factors I might have missed? Let me double-check. So Ball A's rotation period is 13 minutes. Ball B's is 7 minutes. Their LCM is indeed 91. So yes, 91 minutes is the earliest time when both have completed an integer number of rotations.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option A.\n",
