      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the question is about a pen company's manufacturing cost per pen. Hmm, I remember that profit is calculated based on the cost price, so I'll need to think about that.\n\nThe company produces pens, and on average, 10% are defective and rejected. So that means, for every 100 pens they make, 10 are thrown away, leaving 90 good ones. So, if they need to deliver 7200 pens, how many do they actually have to manufacture?\n\nWait, right. Because 10% are defective, they can't just make 7200 pens. They need to make more to account for the defective ones. Let me calculate that. So if 90% of the produced pens are acceptable, then the number of pens they make (let's call it N) multiplied by 90% should equal 7200.\n\nSo, N * 0.9 = 7200. To find N, divide both sides by 0.9. 7200 / 0.9 is 8000. So they make 8000 pens in total.\n\nNow, the company sells each pen for Rs. 10 and they deliver 7200 pens. So their revenue is 7200 * 10 = Rs. 72,000.\n\nThey estimate an overall profit of 25% on all the manufactured pens. Wait, profit is calculated on the cost price. So, profit is 25%, which means the selling price is 125% of the cost price.\n\nLet me denote the cost price per pen as C. The total cost for all pens is 8000 * C. The revenue is Rs. 72,000, which is equal to cost plus 25% profit.\n\nSo, Revenue = Cost + 25% of Cost. That's the same as Revenue = 1.25 * Cost.\n\nSo, 72,000 = 1.25 * (8000 * C). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, calculate 8000 * C. Let's call that Total Cost. So, 72,000 = 1.25 * Total Cost.\n\nSo, Total Cost = 72,000 / 1.25. Let me compute that. 72,000 divided by 1.25. Hmm, 72,000 / 1.25 is the same as 72,000 * (4/5) because 1.25 is 5/4. Wait, no, 1.25 is 5/4, so 1/1.25 is 4/5. So 72,000 * 4/5 is 72,000 * 0.8 = 57,600.\n\nSo the total cost is Rs. 57,600 for 8000 pens. Therefore, the cost per pen is 57,600 / 8000. Let me calculate that. 57600 divided by 8000. Hmm, 8000 goes into 57600 seven times (7*8000=56000), and then 1600 left. 1600/8000 is 0.2. So 7.2? Wait, 7.2 is 7200, wait no. Wait, 57600 divided by 8000. Let's compute 8000 * 7 = 56000. 57600 - 56000 = 1600. 1600 is 0.2 of 8000 (since 8000 * 0.2 = 1600). So 7 + 0.2 = 7.2. So the cost per pen is Rs. 7.2.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If each pen costs Rs. 7.2, then 8000 pens would be 8000 *7.2 = 57,600. The revenue is 72,000. So profit is 72,000 -57,600 = 14,400. The profit percentage is (14400 /57600)*100% = 25%, which matches the given condition. So that seems correct.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is Rs.7.2. So the answer should be B.\n",

So 72,000 * 4/5 is 72,000 * 0.8 = 57,600.\n\nSo the total cost is Rs. 57,600 for 8000 pens. Therefore, the cost per pen is 57,600 / 8000. Let me calculate that. 57600 divided by 8000. Hmm, 8000 goes into 57600 seven times (7*8000=56000), and then 1600 left. 1600/8000 is 0.2. So 7.2? Wait, 7.2 is 7200, wait no. Wait, 57600 divided by 8000.

So, for every 100 pens they make, 10 are defective, and 90 are good. That's a 10% rejection rate.\n\nThey have a deal to deliver 7200 pens to a wholesaler. Each pen is sold for Rs. 10. So, the total revenue from this sale would be 7200 multiplied by 10, which is 72,000 Rs.\n\nNow, the company estimates that their overall profit on all the manufactured pens is 25%. Hmm, okay, so profit is calculated on the cost price, I think. So, the profit is 25% of the total cost. That means the selling price is 125% of the cost price.\n\nWait, but in this case, the selling price is given as Rs. 10 each for the delivered pens. But wait, the 7200 pens are the ones delivered after accounting for the defective ones. Because 10% are rejected, so they must have made more than 7200 pens. So, the 7200 is the number after rejecting the defective ones.\n\nLet me think. Let's denote the total number of pens manufactured as M. Since 10% are defective, 90% are good. So, 0.9 * M = 7200. So, M = 7200 / 0.9. Let me calculate that: 7200 divided by 0.9 is 8000. So, they made 8000 pens, and 10% (800) were defective, leaving 7200 good pens sold.\n\nThe revenue from selling 7200 pens is 7200 * 10 = 72,000 Rs.\n\nNow, the company's overall profit is 25% on all manufactured pens. So, the selling price of the 7200 pens includes a 25% profit over the total cost of manufacturing all 8000 pens.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The profit is on the total manufactured pens. So, the cost is the cost per pen multiplied by the total number of pens made (8000). The revenue is from the 7200 pens, which is 7200 * 10 = 72,000.\n\nSo, profit is 25% on the total cost. So, selling price equals cost plus 25% of cost. So, selling price is 125% of cost.\n\nWait, but the selling price is only from the 7200 pens. Wait, perhaps I should model it as:\n\nTotal revenue = total cost + profit.\n\nProfit is 25% of total cost.\n\nSo, revenue = cost * 1.25.\n\nBut the revenue is 72,000, but wait, that's only from the 7200 pens. So, is the total cost the cost of all 8000 pens, or just the 7200? Hmm, that's a crucial point.\n\nI think the total cost is the cost of all 8000 pens because the problem states the overall profit on all the manufactured pens. So, the cost is for all 8000 pens, and the revenue is from selling 7200 pens, which gives a profit of 25% on the total cost.\n\nSo, let me write the equation:\n\nRevenue = Cost * (1 + Profit%)\n\nProfit is 25%, so:\n\n7200 * 10 = Cost * 1.25\n\nSo, 72,000 = Cost * 1.25\n\nSo, Cost = 72,000 / 1.25\n\nLet me calculate that. 72,000 divided by 1.25. Well, 72,000 / 1.25 is the same as 72,000 * (4/5), since 1.25 is 5/4. So, 72,000 * 4 = 288,000. Then 288,000 /5 is 57,600. So, total cost is 57,600 Rs.\n\nBut wait, that's the total cost for all 8000 pens. So, the cost per pen is 57,600 / 8000.\n\nCalculating that: 57,600 / 8000. Let's see, 8000 goes into 57,600 how many times?\n\nWell, 8000 * 7 = 56,000. 57,600 -56,000 = 1,600. 8000 * 0.2 = 1,600. So, total is 7.2.\n\nSo, each pen costs 7.2 Rs to manufacture. Wait, but wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait, but if the cost per pen is 7.2, then the total cost for 8000 pens is 7.2 *8000 = 57,600, which matches.

So if they deliver 7200 pens, how many did they actually produce? Let me calculate that.\n\nIf 90% are good, then 7200 is 90% of the total produced. Let me call the total produced as P. So 0.9 * P = 7200. Solving for P, I get P = 7200 / 0.9. Let's compute that: 7200 divided by 0.9 is 8000. So they produced 8000 pens in total.\n\nNow, the revenue from selling 7200 pens is 7200 * Rs. 10 each. Let me compute that: 7200 * 10 = 72,000 Rs.\n\nThe company's profit is 25% on all manufactured pens. Wait, so their cost is based on the total number of pens produced, not just the good ones. Because profit is calculated after considering all costs, including the defective ones.\n\nSo let's denote the cost per pen as C. The total cost for manufacturing 8000 pens would be 8000 * C.\n\nThe profit is 25% of the total cost. So profit = 0.25 * (8000 * C).\n\nThe selling price is revenue, which is 72,000 Rs. The profit is revenue minus cost. So:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Total Cost\n0.25 * (8000 * C) = 72,000 - (8000 * C)\n\nLet me write that equation again:\n\n0.25 * 8000 * C = 72000 - 8000 * C\n\nCompute 0.25 * 8000. 0.25 is a quarter, so 8000 / 4 is 2000. So:\n\n2000 * C = 72000 - 8000 * C\n\nNow, I'll bring all terms with C to one side. Let's add 8000C to both sides:\n\n2000C + 8000C = 72000\n\nWhich is 10,000C = 72,000\n\nSo C = 72,000 / 10,000 = 7.2 Rs.\n\nWait, that's option B. So each pen's manufactured cost is Rs. 7.2.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the logic. The company sells 7200 pens at Rs.10 each, so that's correct. Their total cost is for 8000 pens, because 10% are defective. The profit is 25% on the total cost, so profit is 25% of (8000 * C). So the equation should be:\n\nProfit = 72000 - (8000 * C) = 0.25 * (8000 * C)\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\n72000 = (8000 * C) + 0.25*(8000*C) = 8000*C*(1 + 0.25) = 8000*C*1.25\n\nSo 72000 = 8000 * 1.25 * C\n\nCompute 8000 * 1.25: 8000 * 1 is 8000, 8000 * 0.25 is 2000, so 10,000.\n\nSo 72000 = 10,000 * C \u2192 C=7.2. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option B, Rs.7.2.\n",

They have a contract to deliver 7200 pens to a wholesaler, each at Rs. 10. Their overall profit is estimated to be 25%. I need to find the manufactured cost of each pen.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. First, profit is always based on cost, right? So if the company makes a 25% profit overall, that's on their total costs. But wait, they're only delivering 7200 pens, but they have a 10% defective rate.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a pen company, and I need to figure out the manufactured cost of each pen. Hmm, let me read through the problem again to make sure I get all the details right.\n\nAlright, the company produces fine pens. They know that on average, 10% of the pens are defective and get rejected before packing. So, for every 100 pens they make, 10 are no good and are thrown away. That means they only have 90 good pens to sell for every 100 produced. Got it.\n\nThey promise to deliver 7200 pens to their wholesaler. Each pen is sold for Rs. 10. So, the total revenue from this sale would be 7200 multiplied by 10, which is 72,000 rupees. But wait, the 7200 pens are the good ones, right? Because the defective ones are rejected. So, the company actually has to produce more pens to end up with 7200 good ones.\n\nOh right, because 10% are defective. So, if they need to deliver 7200 pens, they must have produced a certain number where 90% are good. Let me calculate how many pens they actually made. Let's say the total produced is X. Then, 90% of X is 7200. So, 0.9X = 7200. Solving for X gives X = 7200 / 0.9. Let me compute that: 7200 divided by 0.9 is 8000. So, they produced 8000 pens in total. Out of these, 10% (which is 800 pens) are defective and rejected.\n\nNow, the company estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. Hmm, so profit is calculated on the cost, right? So, the selling price minus the cost equals profit, and profit is 25% of the cost. So, the formula would be Selling Price = Cost + 25% of Cost, which can be written as SP = 1.25 * Cost.\n\nWait, but wait. The selling price here is the price at which they sell the pens, but they sold 7200 pens at Rs.10 each, so total revenue is 72,000. But that's just for the good pens. The total cost would be based on all the pens they produced, which is 8000 pens. So, the cost per pen is what we're looking for.\n\nLet me denote the cost per pen as C. So, the total cost for all 8000 pens would be 8000 * C. The revenue is 72,000. The profit is revenue minus total cost. The profit is 25% of the total cost. So, profit = 0.25 * total cost.\n\nPutting that into an equation: Revenue = Total Cost + Profit. So, 72,000 = (8000 * C) + (0.25 * 8000 * C). Let me compute that.\n\nAlternatively, I can write this as Revenue = Total Cost * (1 + profit margin). Because profit margin is 25%, so 1.25 times the cost. Wait, but is the profit margin on total cost or on something else? Oh right, profit is calculated on the cost, so the selling price is 1.25 times the cost. But wait, the selling price is per pen, right? Or is the revenue a total?\n\nWait a second, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. The company sells each pen for Rs.10, but the cost per pen is what we're trying to find. The total revenue is 7200 pens * Rs.10 = Rs.72,000. The total cost is 8000 pens * C. The profit is 25% on the total cost.\n\nSo, Profit = Revenue - Total Cost. And Profit = 0.25 * Total Cost. So,\n\n0.25 * (8000 * C) = 72000 - (8000 * C)\n\nLet me write that equation:\n\n0.25 * (8000 C) = 72000 - 8000 C\n\nCompute 0.25 *8000: that's 2000. So,\n\n2000 C = 72000 - 8000 C\n\nBring all the terms with C to one side. So, 2000 C + 8000 C = 72000\n\nWhich is 10000 C = 72000\n\nSo, C = 72000 / 10000 = 7.2\n\nWait, so the cost per pen is Rs.7.2. Looking at the options, option B is 7.2. So the answer should be B.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the setup.\n\nWait, the profit is 25% on the total cost. So total cost is 8000 * C. Profit is 0.25 * (8000 C). Revenue is 72000.\n\nSo, 8000 C + 0.25 *8000 C = 72000.\n\nWhich is 8000 C * 1.25 =72000.\n\nSo, 10000 C =72000. So, C is 7.2. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, could I have approached it another way? For instance, calculating the effective selling price per good pen and then figuring out the cost based on that?\n\nLet me think. They sold 7200 pens at Rs.10 each, so each pen is sold for 10, but the company's cost per pen is C. But wait, considering that 10% are defective, so for each 10 pens produced, 1 is rejected. So, the cost per good pen is effectively (10 pens' cost)/9 good pens.\n\nWait, but maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the total cost and total selling price.\n\nTotal cost is 8000 * C. Total revenue is 72000.\n\nProfit is 25% on the total cost, so profit is 0.25 * 8000 C = 2000 C.\n\nSo, revenue = cost + profit \u2192 72000 = 8000 C + 2000 C \u2192 72000 = 10000 C \u2192 C=7.2.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B) Rs.7.2.\n",

Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nThe company produces high-quality writing pens. They know that on average, 10% of the pens are defective and get rejected before packing. They promise to deliver 7200 pens to their wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. Their estimated overall profit on all manufactured pens is 25%. The question is asking for the manufactured cost of each pen. The options are given, but I'll try to figure it out without looking at them first.\n\nHmm, okay. So the company sells 7200 pens, each at Rs. 10. Let me calculate the total revenue from that. Revenue is simply the number of pens sold multiplied by the price per pen. So that's 7200 * 10 = Rs. 72,000.\n\nBut wait, the company makes a profit of 25% on all the manufactured pens. Oh, right, that means the profit is calculated based on the cost of manufacturing all the pens, including those that are defective and rejected. So I need to find the total manufacturing cost, and then the profit is 25% of that. \n\nLet me denote the total number of pens manufactured as 'x'. Out of these, 10% are defective, so 0.1x are rejected. That leaves 0.9x pens that are good and are sold. But the company is delivering 7200 pens, so 0.9x must equal 7200.\n\nWait, no. Because 7200 is the number of pens delivered to the wholesaler. So 0.9x = 7200. Because only 90% of the manufactured pens are good and get delivered. So I can solve for x.\n\nSo 0.9x = 7200 \u2192 x = 7200 / 0.9. Let me compute that. 7200 divided by 0.9. 7200 / 0.9 is the same as 7200 * (10/9) which is 8000. So x is 8000 pens. So the company manufactures 8000 pens, but 10% are defective, so 800 pens are rejected, and 7200 are sold.\n\nNow, the total revenue is 7200 * 10 = 72,000 Rs, as I thought earlier.\n\nThe company makes a 25% profit on all manufactured pens. So their profit is 25% of the total manufacturing cost. Let me denote the total manufacturing cost as C. Then, profit is 0.25 * C.\n\nThe revenue is equal to the manufacturing cost plus the profit. So Revenue = C + Profit \u2192 72,000 = C + 0.25C \u2192 72,000 = 1.25C.\n\nTo find C, I can rearrange: C = 72,000 / 1.25. Let me compute that. 72,000 divided by 1.25. Hmm, 1.25 is the same as 5/4, so dividing by 5/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/5. So 72,000 * (4/5) = 72,000 * 0.8 = 57,600. So the total manufacturing cost is 57,600 Rs.\n\nBut wait, that's the total cost for all 8000 pens. So the cost per pen is 57,600 / 8000. Let me calculate that. 57,600 \u00f7 8000. Let's see, 8000 goes into 57,600 how many times?\n\nWell, 8000 * 7 is 56,000. 57,600 -56,000 = 1,600. 8000 * 0.2 is 1,600. So 7 + 0.2 = 7.2. So each pen costs Rs. 7.2 to manufacture.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. 8000 pens cost 57,600. So per pen is 57,600 /8000= 7.2. Yes.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is Rs.7.2. So the correct answer should be B.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it: The selling price is 10 per pen, and the cost per pen is C. But wait, the cost is 7.2, but the selling price is 10, so the profit per pen is 2.8, but wait, the overall profit is 25% on the manufacturing cost. Hmm, perhaps that approach complicates things, but the way I did it before seems correct.\n\nWait, let's make sure. The company's profit is 25% on the total manufacturing cost. So profit is 0.25 * C. So total revenue is C + 0.25C = 1.25 C. So 72,000 = 1.25 C \u2192 C=57,600. That's correct.\n\nSo each pen's manufacturing cost is 57,600 /8000 =7.2. So the answer is B.\n",

They deliver 7200 pens to the wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. Their overall profit is estimated to be 25%. I need to find the cost to manufacture each pen.\n\nWait, so the company sells 7200 pens, but they have to produce more because 10% are defective. Let me break it down. If 10% are defective, that means 90% of the produced pens are good and can be sold. So the number of good pens is 7200. Let me call the total produced pens 'P'. So 90% of P is 7200. \n\nSo mathematically, 0.9 * P = 7200. To find P, I can divide 7200 by 0.9. Let me calculate that: 7200 / 0.9 equals... 7200 divided by 9 is 800, so 7200 / 0.9 is 8000. So they produce 8000 pens in total.\n\nEach pen is sold at Rs. 10, so the total revenue from sales is 7200 * 10. Let me compute that: 7200 * 10 is 72,000 rupees.\n\nThe company's overall profit is 25%. Profit is calculated on the cost, right? So profit is 25% of the total cost. So their selling price must cover the cost plus 25% profit. \n\nWait, but wait. Let me think about the total cost and total selling price. The total revenue is 72,000, which includes the profit. So the total cost plus 25% of the cost equals 72,000. Let me represent the total cost as C. Then, C + 0.25C = 72,000. That simplifies to 1.25C = 72,000. So C is 72,000 divided by 1.25. \n\nCalculating that: 72,000 / 1.25. Hmm, 1.25 is 5/4, so dividing by 5/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/5. So 72,000 * (4/5) = 72,000 * 0.8. Let me see, 72,000 * 0.8 is 57,600. So the total cost to manufacture all pens is 57,600 rupees.\n\nBut wait, the total cost includes all the pens they produced, including the defective ones. Because they have to manufacture all 8000 pens, whether they're good or not. So the cost per pen is total cost divided by number of pens produced, which is 8000.\n\nSo per pen cost is 57,600 / 8000. Let me compute that. 57,600 divided by 8000. Well, 8000 goes into 57,600 how many times? Let me see, 8000 *7 is 56,000. 57,600 -56,000=1,600. 8000 goes into 1,600 0.2 times. So 7.2 times. So 7.2 rupees per pen.\n\nWait, that would be option B) Rs.7.2. But wait, I should double-check my steps.\n\nAnother way: Let me re-calculate the per pen cost. Total cost is 57,600 for 8000 pens. 57,600 /8000 = 7.2. Yes, that's right.\n\nBut wait, sometimes profit is calculated on the cost of goods sold. Hmm, but in this problem, it says overall profit on all the manufactured pens is 25%. So the total cost is the cost of all 8000 pens.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a pen company, and I'm trying to figure out the manufactured cost of each pen. Hmm, let's break it down.\n\nThe company produces pens, and on average, 10% of them are defective and rejected. So if they make a certain number of pens, 10% are thrown away. That means only 90% of the pens are good and get sold.\n\nThey have a deal to deliver 7200 pens to a wholesaler. Each pen is sold for Rs. 10. So first, I think I should calculate the total revenue from this sale. Revenue is the number of pens sold multiplied by the price per pen. So 7200 pens times Rs. 10 each. Let me do that: 7200 * 10 = Rs. 72,000. Okay, so their total revenue is 72,000 rupees.\n\nNow, the company estimates an overall profit of 25% on all the manufactured pens. Wait, profit is calculated on the cost, right? So if their profit is 25%, that means the selling price is 125% of the cost. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think. Profit is calculated as (Revenue - Cost)/Cost = Profit percentage. So Profit = 25%, so Revenue = Cost + 25% of Cost = 1.25 * Cost.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the company's overall profit on all the manufactured pens is 25%. So the profit is based on the total cost of all the pens they produce, not just the ones they sell. Because they have to account for the defective pens as well.\n\nSo, let me denote the total number of pens produced as N. Out of these, 10% are defective, so 0.1*N are rejected. So they only have 0.9*N pens that are sold. But the wholesaler is receiving 7200 pens. So 0.9*N = 7200. Wait, no, because the 7200 pens are the ones delivered. So that's the number of good pens. So 0.9*N = 7200. So N = 7200 / 0.9. Let me calculate that: 7200 divided by 0.9 is 8000. So the company produces 8000 pens, of which 10% (800) are defective, and 7200 are good and sold.\n\nNow, the revenue is 7200 * 10 = 72,000. Their total cost is the cost of producing all 8000 pens. Let me denote the cost per pen as C. So total cost is 8000 * C.\n\nThe profit is 25% on the total manufactured pens. So Profit = 0.25 * Total Cost. Then, Profit = Revenue - Total Cost. So 0.25 * (8000*C) = 72,000 - 8000*C.\n\nWait, wait. Let me write that equation again. Profit is 25% of the total cost. So:\n\nProfit = 0.25 * Total Cost.\n\nBut Profit is also equal to Revenue minus Total Cost.\n\nSo,\n\nRevenue - Total Cost = 0.25 * Total Cost.\n\nSo,\n\nRevenue = Total Cost + 0.25 * Total Cost = 1.25 * Total Cost.\n\nSo,\n\n72,000 = 1.25 * (8000 * C).\n\nLet me compute the right side: 8000*C * 1.25 = 8000 * 1.25 * C = 10,000 * C.\n\nWait, wait, 8000 * 1.25 is 10,000? Let me calculate 8000 * 1.25: 8000 * 1 is 8000, 8000 * 0.25 is 2000, so total is 10,000. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo,\n\n72,000 = 10,000 * C.\n\nSo,\n\nC = 72,000 / 10,000 = 7.2.\n\nWait, so the cost per pen is Rs. 7.2. Hmm, looking at the options, option B is 7.2.\n\nBut wait a second, let me double-check. Because sometimes, profit is calculated on the cost price, but maybe the way I've set up the equation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the 25% profit is on the cost of the pens that are sold, but I don't think so. The problem says the overall profit on all the manufactured pens, so it should be based on the total cost of all pens produced, including the defective ones.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the total cost. The company sells 7200 pens at Rs. 10 each, so revenue is 72,000. The total cost is for 8000 pens, each costing C. So total cost is 8000*C.\n\nProfit is 25% on the total cost, so profit is 0.25*(8000*C) = 2000*C.\n\nBut Profit is Revenue - Total Cost. So,\n\n2000*C = 72,000 - 8000*C.\n\nAdding 8000*C to both sides:\n\n10,000*C = 72,000.\n\nC = 72,000 / 10,000 = 7.2.\n\nSo yes, same result. So the cost per pen is Rs. 7.2.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a pen company, and I'm trying to figure out the manufactured cost of each pen. Hmm, let's break it down.\n\nThe company produces pens, and on average, 10% of them are defective and rejected. So if they make a certain number of pens, 10% are thrown away. That means only 90% of the pens are good and get sold.\n\nThey have a deal to deliver 7200 pens to a wholesaler. Each pen is sold for Rs. 10. So first, I think I should calculate the total revenue from this sale. Revenue is the number of pens sold multiplied by the price per pen. So 7200 pens times Rs. 10 each. Let me do that: 7200 * 10 = Rs. 72,000. Okay, so their total revenue is 72,000 rupees.\n\nNow, the company estimates an overall profit of 25% on all the manufactured pens. Wait, profit is calculated on the cost, right? So if their profit is 25%, that means the selling price is 125% of the cost. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think. Profit is calculated as (Revenue - Cost)/Cost = Profit percentage. So Profit = 25%, so Revenue = Cost + 25% of Cost = 1.25 * Cost.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the company's overall profit on all the manufactured pens is 25%. So the profit is based on the total cost of all the pens they produce, not just the ones they sell. Because they have to account for the defective pens as well.\n\nSo, let me denote the total number of pens produced as N. Out of these, 10% are defective, so 0.1*N are rejected. So they only have 0.9*N pens that are sold. But the wholesaler is receiving 7200 pens. So 0.9*N = 7200. Wait, no, because the 7200 pens are the ones delivered. So that's the number of good pens. So 0.9*N = 7200. So N = 7200 / 0.9. Let me calculate that: 7200 divided by 0.9 is 8000. So the company produces 8000 pens, of which 10% (800) are defective, and 7200 are good and sold.\n\nNow, the revenue is 7200 * 10 = 72,000. Their total cost is the cost of producing all 8000 pens. Let me denote the cost per pen as C. So total cost is 8000 * C.\n\nThe profit is 25% on the total manufactured pens. So Profit = 0.25 * Total Cost. Then, Profit = Revenue - Total Cost. So 0.25 * (8000*C) = 72,000 - 8000*C.\n\nWait, wait. Let me write that equation again. Profit is 25% of the total cost. So:\n\nProfit = 0.25 * Total Cost.\n\nBut Profit is also equal to Revenue minus Total Cost.\n\nSo,\n\nRevenue - Total Cost = 0.25 * Total Cost.\n\nSo,\n\nRevenue = Total Cost + 0.25 * Total Cost = 1.25 * Total Cost.\n\nSo,\n\n72,000 = 1.25 * (8000 * C).\n\nLet me compute the right side: 8000*C * 1.25 = 8000 * 1.25 * C = 10,000 * C.\n\nWait, wait, 8000 * 1.25 is 10,000?

Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo,\n\n72,000 = 10,000 * C.\n\nSo,\n\nC = 72,000 / 10,000 = 7.2.\n\nWait, so the cost per pen is Rs. 7.2.

Let me denote the total number of pens produced as N. Out of these, 10% are defective, so 0.1N are rejected. The good pens are 0.9N. They sold 7200 pens, so 0.9N must be equal to 7200, right?\n\nSo, 0.9N = 7200. To find N, I can rearrange that: N = 7200 / 0.9. Let me calculate that. 7200 divided by 0.9 is the same as 7200 multiplied by (10/9), which is 7200 * 1.111... Let me see, 7200 / 9 = 800, so 800 * 10 = 8000. So N is 8000 pens. So they produced 8000 pens, with 10% defective, which is 800 pens rejected, leaving 7200 good pens, which they sold.\n\nNext, the revenue from selling these pens is 7200 * 10 = Rs. 72,000.

So, profit is 25% of the total cost. \n\nLet me denote the manufacturing cost per pen as C. So the total manufacturing cost for all pens is N * C = 8000 * C.\n\nThe total revenue is Rs.72,000. Profit is revenue minus cost. So profit = revenue - cost = 72,000 - (8000 * C).\n\nBut the profit is 25% of the total cost. So profit = 0.25 * (8000 * C).\n\nPutting it together: 72,000 - (8000 * C) = 0.25 * (8000 * C)\n\nLet me simplify this equation. Let's compute 0.25 * 8000*C first. 0.25 *8000 is 2000, so 2000*C.\n\nSo the equation becomes: 72,000 - 8000C = 2000C.\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side. 72,000 = 8000C + 2000C \u2192 72,000 = 10,000C.\n\nSo, solving for C: C = 72,000 / 10,000 = 7.2. \n\nWait, so the manufacturing cost per pen is Rs.7.2.
