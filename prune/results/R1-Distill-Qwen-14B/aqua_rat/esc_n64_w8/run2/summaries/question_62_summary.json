      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about ages, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe question states: Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So, that means the difference between Q and R is the same as the difference between Q and T, but in the opposite direction. Wait, no, I think I got that right. Because if Q is younger than R by a certain amount, then he must be older than T by the same amount. So, the difference between R and Q is equal to the difference between Q and T. So, R is older than Q, and Q is older than T by the same age difference.\n\nSo, mathematically, I can write this as R - Q = Q - T. That makes sense because the difference between R and Q is the same as the difference between Q and T. So, R - Q equals Q - T.\n\nNext part: The sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. So, R + T = 50. I need to find the difference between R and Q's age, which is R - Q.\n\nHmm, okay, so I have these two equations now:\n\n1. R - Q = Q - T \u2192 Let's rearrange this equation. If I move Q to the other side, I get R - Q - Q = -T \u2192 R - 2Q = -T \u2192 So, T = 2Q - R.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let me write the equations again.\n\nEquation 1: R - Q = Q - T \u2192 R + T = 2Q. Oh, wait! Because if R - Q = Q - T, then adding Q to both sides on the left and adding T to both sides on the right would give R = 2Q - T. Alternatively, adding the two sides: R - Q + Q = Q - T + Q \u2192 R = 2Q - T. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the right way.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's say the difference between R and Q is D years. So, R = Q + D. And since Q is as much older than T as he is younger than R, that difference D is the same as Q - T. So, Q = T + D. Therefore, T = Q - D.\n\nNow, the sum of R and T is 50. So, R + T = 50. Substituting R and T in terms of Q and D:\n\nR = Q + D, T = Q - D.\n\nSo, R + T = (Q + D) + (Q - D) = 2Q. So, 2Q =50 \u2192 Q=25.\n\nWait, so Q is 25 years old? Then, R is Q + D = 25 + D. T is Q - D =25 - D.\n\nBut wait, what's the question again? It asks for the difference between R and Q's age. R - Q is D. So, if I can find D, that's the answer. But do I have enough information to find D?\n\nLooking back, I only know that R + T =50, which we used to find Q=25. But without more info, like individual ages or another equation, I can't find D. Because D could be any value, as long as R and T are 25+D and 25-D, respectively, and their sum is 50.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't give any other constraints, like the ages of R or T or the exact value of D. So, without additional information, the difference between R and Q (which is D) can't be determined. So, the answer would be that it cannot be determined from the given information.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because maybe I'm missing something. The question is about the difference between R and Q, which is D. But I don't have any other equations to solve for D. The sum of R and T is 50, which gives Q=25, but D is still unknown.\n\nSo, the options are A)22, B)27, C)29, D)Cannot be determined, E)None of the above.\n\nSo, the correct answer would be D) Cannot be determined.\n",

The sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. I need to find the definite difference between R and Q's age. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. The first part says Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So, that's a bit tricky. I think I need to translate this into mathematical terms.\n\nLet me assign variables. Let Q be Q's age, R be R's age, and T be T's age. So, the first statement is about the differences in their ages.\n\nWhen it says Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T, it implies that the difference between R and Q is the same as the difference between Q and T. Wait, but since Q is younger than R, the difference would be R - Q. And Q is older than T, so the difference there is Q - T. So setting these equal: R - Q = Q - T.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So equation one is R - Q = Q - T. Let me rearrange this to see if I can get a relationship between R, Q, and T.\n\nAdding Q to both sides: R = 2Q - T.\n\nWait, or maybe it's better to write it as R - Q = Q - T, which can be rearranged as R + T = 2Q. Because if I add Q to both sides, R = 2Q - T, but that might not help directly. Alternatively, adding T to both sides and adding Q to both, maybe I can find something else. Alternatively, R - Q = Q - T can be rewritten as R + T = 2Q. Yes, that seems right.\n\nSo equation one is R + T = 2Q. Now, the second part of the problem states that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. So equation two is R + T = 50.\n\nWait, so equation one is R + T = 2Q, and equation two is R + T =50. So, setting these equal, 2Q =50. That would mean Q =25.\n\nOh, so Q is 25 years old. But the question is asking for the difference between R and Q's age, which is R - Q. Because Q is younger than R, the difference is positive.\n\nFrom equation one, since R + T =50 and also R + T =2Q, and we've found Q=25, then R + T =50. But how does that help us find R?\n\nWait, let me think. We have R + T =50. And from equation one, R - Q = Q - T. We can substitute Q=25 into that.\n\nSo R -25 = 25 - T. Let's rearrange this. R + T =50. Wait, that's the same as equation two. Hmm, so maybe I need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since R + T =50, and R - Q = Q - T, which is R -25=25-T.\n\nLet me solve for R in terms of T. From R -25=25-T, add 25 to both sides: R =50 - T.\n\nBut since R + T =50, substituting R=50-T into that equation gives (50-T) + T =50, which simplifies to 50=50. So that doesn't give me new information. Hmm, that's not helpful.\n\nWait, so maybe I can't find exact values for R and T individually because there are infinite possibilities as long as R + T=50. So, for example, R could be 30 and T 20, R=25 and T=25, R=40 and T=10, etc. But the question is about the difference between R and Q's age, which is R -25.\n\nBut wait, from equation one, R + T =2Q=50, so R=50-T. The difference between R and Q is R -25 = (50-T) -25 =25 - T. But since T can be any age as long as R + T=50, the difference R-Q depends on T. So without knowing T's exact age, we can't find the exact difference between R and Q.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the definitely the difference between R and Q's age. So if I can't find a specific value, then the answer must be that it cannot be determined. Or wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem states that Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So the difference between R and Q is the same as the difference between Q and T. So R - Q = Q - T. Let me call this difference 'd'. So R = Q + d, and Q = T + d. So T = Q -d.\n\nNow, since R + T =50, substituting R and T in terms of Q and d: (Q + d) + (Q -d) =50. Simplifying: 2Q =50 \u2192 Q=25. So that's the same as before. But the difference d is R - Q, which is d, and Q - T is also d. So R =25 +d, T=25 -d.\n\nSo R + T = (25 +d) + (25 -d) =50, which holds for any d. So the value of d can be any positive number, but how does that affect the difference between R and Q? Because R - Q is d. But since d can vary, the difference can vary. So without more information, we can't determine the exact difference between R and Q.\n\nWait, but wait. The question is asking for the difference between R and Q's age. Since R is Q +d, the difference is d, which can be any positive number. So the difference could be, say, 5 years, 10 years, etc. But the options don't include a variable, so the answer must be that it cannot be determined.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is \"Cannot be determined\", and E is \"None of the above\". So in this case, since the difference depends on d and we don't have more information, the answer would be D.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. When the problem says \"Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T\", that sets up the equation R - Q = Q - T, leading to R + T =2Q. And R + T is 50, so Q is 25. So Q is 25, but R could be any value greater than 25 as long as T is 50 - R, and T must be less than 25 (since Q is older than T). So R =25 +d, T=25 -d. So the difference between R and Q is d, which could be any positive number. Therefore, the difference is variable, and we can't determine it with the given information.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question says that Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. Hmm, I need to break that down. So, Q's age difference from R is the same as his age difference from T, but in opposite directions. So, if Q is younger than R by a certain number of years, he's older than T by the same number. \n\nLet me assign some variables to make it easier. Let's say Q's age is q, R's age is r, and T's age is t. \n\nThe first part says Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So, the difference between R and Q is equal to the difference between Q and T. So, mathematically, that would be r - q = q - t. Because R is older than Q by (r - q), and Q is older than T by (q - t). So, these two differences are the same. \n\nSo, r - q = q - t. Let's rearrange this equation to see if we can find a relationship. If I add q to both sides, I get r = 2q - t. Alternatively, maybe I can bring all terms to one side: r + t = 2q. Oh, that's interesting. So, the sum of R and T's ages is twice Q's age. \n\nThe second part of the problem says that the sum of R and T's ages is 50. So, r + t = 50. But from the earlier equation, r + t = 2q. So, 2q = 50. That means q = 25. So, Q is 25 years old.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the difference between R and Q's age. So, we need to find r - q. From the earlier equation, r - q = q - t. Since q is 25, let's see if we can find r - 25.\n\nWe know that r + t =50 and r - q = q - t. Let me substitute q=25 into that. So, r -25 =25 - t. Rearranging, r + t =50, which we already know. Hmm, so that doesn't give us more info.\n\nWait, maybe I can express r in terms of t. Let's see: From r + t =50, r =50 - t. And from the first equation, r - q = q - t. Substituting r =50 - t and q=25, we get (50 - t) -25 =25 - t. Simplify left side: 25 - t =25 - t. Oh, that's just 0=0. So, that doesn't help us find the actual ages, just confirms our equations are consistent.\n\nSo, the problem is that even though we know Q is 25, and R + T is 50, we don't have enough information to find the exact ages of R and T individually. Because R could be any age, and T would adjust accordingly to make their sum 50. \n\nWait, but the question is about the difference between R and Q's age, which is r - q. From earlier, we have r - q = q - t. Since q is 25, that's r -25 =25 -t. Let's see: r + t =50. So, let's express t as 50 - r. Substitute into the equation: r -25 =25 - (50 - r). Simplify the right side: 25 -50 + r = -25 + r. So, the equation becomes r -25 = r -25. Again, 0=0. So, this doesn't give any new info.\n\nSo, the difference r - q is equal to q - t, which is the same as 25 - t. But since t =50 - r, substituting gives 25 - (50 - r) = r -25. So, r -25 is equal to r -25, which is just the same thing again. \n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. Since r + t =50, and r - q = q - t, which is the same as (r + t) = 2q. So, 50 =2q, so q=25. So, the difference between R and Q is r -25, which is the same as 25 - t. But without knowing either r or t, how can we find the exact difference?\n\nThe question is asking for the definite difference between R and Q's age. Since we can't find a specific value, the answer might be that it can't be determined. But wait, wait. Let's think again. From the first equation, r - q = q - t, so r - q = 25 - t. But r + t =50, so t =50 - r. Substitute into the equation: r -25 =25 - (50 - r). Let's compute the right side: 25 -50 + r = r -25. So, r -25 = r -25. Again, it's the same equation. So, it's consistent, but we can't find r or t.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think about the difference. So, r - q is equal to q - t. So, let's denote the difference as d. So, d = r - q = q - t. So, d = q - t, which is the same as d =25 - t. Also, since r = q + d, and t = q - d. Because r is older than Q by d, and T is younger than Q by d.\n\nSo, r =25 + d, and t=25 - d. Now, the sum r + t = (25 + d) + (25 -d )=50. Which matches the given condition. So, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, what's the question again? The question is what is definitely the difference between R and Q's age. So, that's d. But from the equations, d can be any value as long as r and t are positive. Because if d is 25, then t would be zero, which is possible if T is 0 years old. But if d is 30, then t would be -5, which is impossible. So, d can be up to 25.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't give any constraints on the ages. So, R and T's ages could be any positive numbers that sum to 50, as long as R is older than Q by the same amount that Q is older than T. But without more information, the difference d could be any value. So, the problem asks what is definitely the difference between R and Q's age. Since d can vary, we can't determine it uniquely.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. The sum of R and T is 50, and the difference between R and Q is equal to the difference between Q and T. So, Q is the midpoint between R and T. Because if you have two numbers, R and T, and Q is exactly in the middle, then R - Q = Q - T, and their sum is 2Q. Since their sum is 50, 2Q=50, so Q=25. So, R and T are equally distant from 25. So, R =25 +d, T=25 -d. So, their difference from Q is d. So, the difference between R and Q is d, but d can be any value as long as T is positive.\n\nFor example, if d=20, then R=45, T=5. If d=25, R=50, T=0. But T can't be negative, so d can be up to 25. But the problem doesn't specify any constraints on their current ages beyond the sum. So, d could be any number between 0 and 25. So, without knowing more, we can't find the exact difference between R and Q. So, the answer must be that it cannot be determined from the given information.\n\nWait, but the options include 'Cannot be determined' as option D. So, that would be the correct answer.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question says that Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. Hmm, I need to break that down. So, Q's age difference from R is the same as his age difference from T, but in opposite directions. So, if Q is younger than R by a certain number of years, he's older than T by the same number. \n\nLet me assign some variables to make it easier. Let's say Q's age is q, R's age is r, and T's age is t. \n\nThe first part says Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So, the difference between R and Q is equal to the difference between Q and T. So, mathematically, that would be r - q = q - t. Because R is older than Q by (r - q), and Q is older than T by (q - t). So, these two differences are the same. \n\nSo, r - q = q - t. Let's rearrange this equation to see if we can find a relationship. If I add q to both sides, I get r = 2q - t. Alternatively, maybe I can bring all terms to one side: r + t = 2q. Oh, that's interesting. So, the sum of R and T's ages is twice Q's age. \n\nThe second part of the problem says that the sum of R and T's ages is 50. So, r + t = 50. But from the earlier equation, r + t = 2q. So, 2q = 50. That means q = 25. So, Q is 25 years old.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the difference between R and Q's age. So, we need to find r - q. From the earlier equation, r - q = q - t.

This gives the equation:\n\n\\[\nr - q = q - t\n\\]\n\nRearranging this, we find:\n\n\\[\nr + t = 2q\n\\]\n\nThe problem also states that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years:\n\n\\[\nr + t = 50\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( r + t = 50 \\) into \\( r + t = 2q \\), we get:\n\n\\[\n50 = 2q \\implies q = 25\n\\]\n\nThus, Q is 25 years old. The difference between R and Q's age is the same as the difference between Q and T's age, denoted as \\( x \\). Therefore:\n\n\\[\nr = 25 + x \\quad \\text{and} \\quad t = 25 - x\n\\]\n\nSince \\( r + t = 50 \\), substituting \\( r = 25 + x \\) and \\( t = 25 - x \\) confirms that:\n\n\\[\n(25 + x) + (25 - x) = 50\n\\]\n\nThis shows that \\( x \\) can be any positive value, as long as \\( r \\) and \\( t \\) are symmetrically spaced around 25. Without additional information, the exact value of \\( x \\) cannot be determined. Therefore, the difference between R and Q's age cannot be definitively calculated.\n\n**Answer: D**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully. \n\nThe question says, \"Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T.\" Hmm, that's a bit of a tricky wording. I think it means that the difference between R and Q is the same as the difference between Q and T. So, if I let the differences be equal, maybe I can write an equation for that.\n\nThen it says, \"the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years.\" Oh, right, so R plus T equals 50. That's another equation. \n\nThe question is asking for the definite difference between R and Q's age. So I need to find out what R - Q is, or maybe Q - R, but I think it's the absolute value, so the difference regardless of order.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's assign variables to each person's age. Let me call Q's age Q, R's age R, and T's age T. \n\nThe first statement: \"Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T.\" So, the amount Q is younger than R is the same as the amount he is older than T. So, R - Q equals Q - T. Because if Q is younger than R by a certain amount, that's the same as Q being older than T by that same amount. \n\nSo, R - Q = Q - T. Let me write that as equation 1. \n\nEquation 1: R - Q = Q - T.\n\nAnd equation 2 is given: R + T = 50. \n\nSo now I have two equations. Let me see if I can find R - Q. \n\nFrom equation 1: R - Q = Q - T. Let me rearrange this. If I add Q to both sides and add T to both sides, wait, maybe it's better to bring all terms to one side. \n\nWait, R - Q = Q - T. Let's bring all terms to the left. So R - Q - Q + T = 0. So R + T - 2Q = 0. \n\nHmm, R + T is 50, from equation 2. So substituting that in, 50 - 2Q = 0. \n\nSo, 50 = 2Q. Then Q is 25. Oh, that's interesting. So Q is 25 years old. \n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the difference between R and Q's age. So R - Q. But from equation 1, R - Q = Q - T. Let me see what that gives us. \n\nSince Q is 25, let's plug that into equation 1. R - 25 = 25 - T. \n\nBut I don't know T yet. Wait, maybe I can find T from equation 2. Because equation 2 is R + T = 50. So T = 50 - R. \n\nSubstituting T into equation 1: R - 25 = 25 - (50 - R). Let's compute the right side. 25 - 50 + R is R -25. So the equation becomes R -25 = R -25. Hmm, that's just 0=0. That's an identity, so it doesn't give me new information. \n\nWait, so that suggests that R can be any value as long as R + T =50, and R - Q = Q - T. But wait, we already found Q=25. So what's the difference between R and Q?\n\nSince R - Q equals Q - T, and Q is 25, let's think about it. Let me denote the difference as D. So D = R - Q. Then, T = Q - D, because Q - T = D. \n\nBut since R + T =50, substituting R and T in terms of D. R is Q + D, and T is Q - D. So (Q + D) + (Q - D) = 50. That simplifies to 2Q =50, so Q=25, which we already have. \n\nSo, the difference D can be any value? Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is giving us specific options. So perhaps I'm missing something here. \n\nWait, the problem asks for the definite difference between R and Q's age. So, perhaps the difference isn't fixed. Because from the equations, all we can find is Q=25, but R could be any value as long as T is 50 - R. \n\nWait, let's see. Let me pick some numbers. Suppose R is 30. Then T would be 20, because 30+20=50. Then Q would be 25. So R - Q is 5, and Q - T is 5. That works. \n\nAnother example: R is 27, T is 23. Then Q is 25. R-Q is 2, Q-T is 2. Also works. \n\nAnother case: R is 40, T is 10. R-Q is 15, Q-T is 15. So yes, that's valid. \n\nWait a minute, so R can be any age as long as T is 50 - R, and Q is 25. So the difference between R and Q (R-Q) can be any value, as long as R is greater than Q, because the problem states that Q is younger than R. Wait, wait, no. The problem says Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So R must be older than Q, and Q must be older than T. So R > Q > T. \n\nSo, the difference D = R - Q = Q - T. Since Q is 25, D can be any positive number, but R must be 25 + D, and T must be 25 - D. \n\nBut since T must be a positive age, 25 - D must be greater than zero. So D must be less than 25. So D can be from, say, 1 to 24. \n\nSo the difference between R and Q can be any value less than 25, but the problem is asking for the definite difference. Hmm. So that's impossible because the difference isn't fixed. \n\nWait, but looking back at the problem statement, the question is what is definitely the difference between R and Q's age. So, if D can be any value, but the sum R+T is fixed, maybe there's another way to find D. \n\nWait, no, because from the equations, we can only determine Q=25, but R and T can vary as long as R+T=50 and R-Q=Q-T. So D could be any value as long as R=25 + D and T=25 - D, but T must be positive. So T=25-D>0 \u2192 D <25. \n\nSo, for example, if D is 10, then R is 35, T is 15. R+T=50, correct. R-Q=10, Q-T=10. \n\nBut the problem gives options, and the options are specific numbers (22,27,29) or E is none of the above. So if the difference can be any number less than 25, then the answer is that the difference cannot be determined. Because from the given information, D can be any value between 0 and 25, so the difference isn't fixed. \n\nWait, but I thought earlier that Q is 25. So if the question is about R - Q, that's D. But D can be any value as long as T=25-D is positive. So the difference isn't fixed. \n\nSo the correct answer must be D) Cannot be determined. Because we can't find a specific value for the difference between R and Q. It depends on their actual ages, which aren't given beyond the sum R+T=50.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Let me re-express the equations. \n\nFrom equation 1: R - Q = Q - T \u2192 R + T = 2Q. \n\nFrom equation 2: R + T =50. \n\nSo, 2Q =50 \u2192 Q=25. So that's fixed. \n\nSo Q is definitely 25. \n\nSo, R - Q = Q - T \u2192 R -25 =25 - T. \n\nBut R + T =50 \u2192 T=50 - R. \n\nSubstituting into R -25=25 - T: \n\nR -25 =25 - (50 - R) \u2192 R-25=25-50 + R \u2192 R-25= R -25. \n\nSo again, it's an identity, which doesn't give any new information. \n\nSo, the difference R - Q is equal to 25 - T. But without knowing T, we can't find R - Q. \n\nWait, but since R + T is 50, and Q is 25, perhaps R - Q is (R) -25, and T is 25 - (R-25) \u2192 T=50 - R. Which is correct. \n\nSo, without additional information, R can vary, leading to varying R-Q. So the difference isn't fixed. \n\nThus, the answer is D) Cannot be determined.\n",

The sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age?\n\nHmm, okay. Let me break this down. So, Q's age relates to R and T in a specific way. The first part says Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. That sounds like a common age problem. Let me try to translate this into equations.\n\nSo, let's denote their ages as variables. Let's say Q is Q, R is R, and T is T.\n\nThe phrase \"Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T\" means that the difference between R and Q is the same as the difference between Q and T. So, R - Q = Q - T. Because Q is younger than R by the same amount he is older than T.\n\nSo, R - Q = Q - T. Let me write that down:\n\nR - Q = Q - T\n\nIf I rearrange this equation, maybe I can find a relationship between R, Q, and T. Let's see.\n\nAdding Q to both sides on the left and adding T to both sides on the right, but wait, maybe it's better to bring like terms together.\n\nLet me rearrange it:\n\nR + T = 2Q\n\nOh, that's interesting. Because if I add R and T together, it's twice Q's age. So, R + T = 2Q.\n\nNow, the problem also states that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. So, R + T = 50.\n\nWait a second, from the first equation we have R + T = 2Q, and from the problem statement, R + T =50. So, substituting, 2Q =50. Therefore, Q=25.\n\nSo, Q is 25 years old.\n\nBut the question is asking for the difference between R and Q's age. So, we need to find R - Q.\n\nWait, but from the first equation, R - Q = Q - T. Let's see.\n\nSince R + T =50, and R - Q = Q - T, maybe I can express R and T in terms of Q.\n\nWe know Q is 25. So, R + T =50. And R - 25 = 25 - T.\n\nLet me see. Let me substitute Q=25 into the equation R - Q = Q - T.\n\nSo, R -25 = 25 - T.\n\nLet's rearrange this: R + T = 50, which we already know. So, substituting, R =50 - T.\n\nWait, but from R -25 =25 - T, substituting R=50-T into that equation:\n\n(50 - T) -25 =25 - T\n\nSimplify left side: 25 - T =25 - T. So that's 25-T on both sides. Which is an identity, meaning it's always true. Hmm.\n\nSo, this doesn't give me any new information. So, I can't find exact values for R and T, but perhaps I can find R - Q.\n\nWait, since Q is 25, and R is 50 - T.\n\nBut I don't know T's value. So, without more info, how can I find R?\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the difference between R and Q. So, R - Q = ?\n\nWe know R + T =50, and R - Q = Q - T.\n\nWait, let me think. Since R + T =50, and R - Q =25 - T.\n\nWait, but R =50 - T.\n\nSo, substitute R into R - Q:\n\n(50 - T) -25 =25 - T.\n\nWhich is 25 - T. So, R - Q =25 - T.\n\nBut I don't know T's value. So, how can I find R - Q?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express R in terms of Q and T.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Since R + T =50, and R - Q = Q - T.\n\nWe can write R = Q + (Q - T) = 2Q - T.\n\nBut R + T =50, so substituting:\n\n(2Q - T) + T =50 \u2192 2Q=50 \u2192 Q=25.\n\nWhich is what we have.\n\nSo, R=2Q - T \u2192 R=50 - T.\n\nSo, R =50 - T. But without knowing T, can we find R - Q?\n\nWait, R - Q is (50-T) -25 =25 - T.\n\nBut T's value is unknown. So, unless we have more info, we can't find the exact difference between R and Q.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking what is definitely the difference between R and Q's age.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps the answer can't be determined with the given information. Because R and Q's difference is 25 - T, but T could be any value. Let me test with some examples.\n\nSuppose T is 20. Then R is 30 (since R + T =50). So, R is 30, Q is25. R - Q is 5.\n\nIf T is 25, then R is25. So, R=25, Q=25.

So, if T is 0, then R = 2Q =50. So, R=50, Q=25.

So, R-Q could be any value between 0 and 25.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the definite difference between R and Q's age. So, without knowing T, we can't find a definite value.

The sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age?\n\nHmm, okay. Let me break this down. So, Q's age relates to R and T in a specific way. The first part says Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. That sounds like a common age problem. Let me try to translate this into equations.\n\nSo, let's denote their ages as variables. Let's say Q is Q, R is R, and T is T.\n\nThe phrase \"Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T\" means that the difference between R and Q is the same as the difference between Q and T. So, R - Q = Q - T. Because Q is younger than R by the same amount he is older than T.\n\nSo, R - Q = Q - T. Let me write that down:\n\nR - Q = Q - T\n\nIf I rearrange this equation, maybe I can find a relationship between R, Q, and T. Let's see.\n\nAdding Q to both sides on the left and adding T to both sides on the right, but wait, maybe it's better to bring like terms together.\n\nLet me rearrange it:\n\nR + T = 2Q\n\nOh, that's interesting. Because if I add R and T together, it's twice Q's age. So, R + T = 2Q.\n\nNow, the problem also states that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. So, R + T = 50.\n\nWait a second, from the first equation we have R + T = 2Q, and from the problem statement, R + T =50. So, substituting, 2Q =50. Therefore, Q=25.\n\nSo, Q is 25 years old.\n\nBut the question is asking for the difference between R and Q's age. So, we need to find R - Q.\n\nWait, but from the first equation, R - Q = Q - T. Let's see.\n\nSince R + T =50, and R - Q = Q - T, maybe I can express R and T in terms of Q.\n\nWe know Q is 25. So, R + T =50. And R - 25 = 25 - T.\n\nLet me see. Let me substitute Q=25 into the equation R - Q = Q - T.\n\nSo, R -25 = 25 - T.\n\nLet's rearrange this: R + T = 50, which we already know. So, substituting, R =50 - T.\n\nWait, but from R -25 =25 - T, substituting R=50-T into that equation:\n\n(50 - T) -25 =25 - T\n\nSimplify left side: 25 - T =25 - T. So that's 25-T on both sides.

So, how can I find R - Q?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express R in terms of Q and T.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Since R + T =50, and R - Q = Q - T.\n\nWe can write R = Q + (Q - T) = 2Q - T.\n\nBut R + T =50, so substituting:\n\n(2Q - T) + T =50 \u2192 2Q=50 \u2192 Q=25.\n\nWhich is what we have.\n\nSo, R=2Q - T \u2192 R=50 - T.\n\nSo, R =50 - T.

So, perhaps the answer can't be determined with the given information. Because R and Q's difference is 25 - T, but T could be any value. Let me test with some examples.\n\nSuppose T is 20. Then R is 30 (since R + T =50). So, R is 30, Q is25. R - Q is 5.\n\nIf T is 25, then R is25. So, R=25, Q=25.

The question says, \"Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T.\" And it also says that the sum of R and T's ages is 50 years. The question is asking for the definite difference between R and Q's age. The options are given, but I need to figure out the right one.\n\nAlright, let me break this down. So, the first part is about Q's age relative to R and T. The phrase \"Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T\" sounds a bit tricky. I think this means that the difference between R and Q is the same as the difference between Q and T. So, if I denote Q's age as Q, R's age as R, and T's age as T, then R - Q = Q - T. Because Q is younger than R by some amount, and older than T by the same amount. So, the difference between R and Q is equal to the difference between Q and T.\n\nLet me write that equation down: R - Q = Q - T. That simplifies to R - Q = Q - T. If I add Q to both sides, I get R = 2Q - T. Or maybe it's better to rearrange it another way. Let's see, R - Q = Q - T implies that R + T = 2Q. Because if I add Q to both sides of R - Q = Q - T, I get R = 2Q - T, but if I add T to both sides of R - Q = Q - T, I get R + T = 2Q. Oh right, that makes sense. So R plus T equals twice Q's age.\n\nWait, the problem also states that the sum of R and T is 50 years. So, R + T = 50. But from the first part, we have R + T = 2Q. So substituting that, 2Q = 50. Oh, so Q must be 25 years old. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the difference between R and Q's age. So, R - Q. But from earlier, we know that R - Q = Q - T. And since Q is 25, let's see. But wait, I don't know T's age yet. Hmm.\n\nWait, I have R + T = 50, and R - Q = Q - T. Let me think. Since Q is 25, R - 25 = 25 - T. So, R = 25 + (25 - T) = 50 - T. But we also know that R + T =50. So substituting R as 50 - T into that equation: (50 - T) + T = 50. Which simplifies to 50 =50. Hmm, that's just confirming the equation, but not giving me new info.\n\nWait, so R = 50 - T. And since R - Q = Q - T, which is 25 - T. So R = Q + (25 - T). But since Q is 25, R = 25 + (25 - T) = 50 - T. Which matches the earlier result.\n\nBut how does that help me find R - Q? Well, R - Q is equal to 25 - T. But I don't have T's value. So without knowing T's age, can I find R - Q?\n\nWait, but maybe I can find R - Q without knowing T. Let's see. Let's consider R and T's sum is 50, and R = 50 - T. So R = 50 - T. So R - Q would be (50 - T) -25 =25 - T. But I don't have T's value. Hmm, this seems like I'm stuck.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can find R - Q in terms of known quantities. Because R + T =50 and R - Q = Q - T. Let me think again.\n\nWe have R + T =50. Also, R - Q = Q - T. Let's add those two equations.\n\nR + T =50\n\nR - Q = Q - T\n\nAdding them: (R + T) + (R - Q) =50 + (Q - T)\n\nSimplify: 2R - Q + T =50 + Q - T.\n\nWait, maybe that's getting messy. Another approach: From R + T =50 and R - Q = Q - T. Let me express T in terms of R. From R + T=50, T=50 - R.\n\nSubstituting into R - Q = Q - T:\n\nR -25 =25 - (50 - R)\n\nBecause Q is 25. So let's compute the right side: 25 -50 + R = (R -25). So equation becomes R -25 = R -25. Which is an identity. Hmm, so this doesn't give any new information.\n\nSo it's not possible to determine the exact value of R - Q because T can vary, leading to different values for R and Q. But wait, earlier I thought that R + T = 2Q, which led to Q=25. So R + T =50 and 2Q=50, so Q=25.\n\nSo the difference R - Q is equal to Q - T, which is 25 - T. But since R + T=50, T=50 - R. So substituting, R -25 =25 - (50 - R) => R -25 = R -25. Again, same as before.\n\nWait, so R - Q = (50 - T) -25 =25 - T. But since T =50 - R, R -25 =25 - (50 - R) \u2192 R -25 = R -25. Which is always true, but doesn't give a specific value.\n\nSo, without additional information, the difference between R and Q's age can't be determined. Because T can vary as long as R and T sum to 50, leading to R and T having different values which affect R - Q.\n\nWait a second, let me think of an example. Suppose T is 20. Then R would be 30 (since 20+30=50). Then Q is 25. So R - Q is 5. Alternatively, if T is 25, then R is 25. Then R - Q is 0. Or if T is 30, then R is 20. R - Q would be -5. So the difference can vary.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the difference between R and Q's age. So the absolute difference? Or just R-Q? The question says \"difference between R and Q's age\". So in the first example, R=30, Q=25. Difference is 5. In the second, R=25, Q=25. Difference is 0. Third, R=20, Q=25. Difference is -5, but absolute is 5. Hmm, but the question doesn't specify absolute, just 'difference'. So depending on the situation, the difference can be positive or negative, but the magnitude can vary.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check. The problem says Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So, if Q is younger than R by x years, and older than T by x years. So R = Q + x, and T = Q - x. So R + T = (Q +x) + (Q -x) )= 2Q. Which is 50, so Q=25. So x is the difference between R and Q, which is the same as the difference between Q and T.\n\nWait, so in this case, R =25 +x, T=25 -x. So R + T =50. So the difference between R and Q is x. But the problem doesn't give us x. So x can be any value, as long as T is positive. Because age can't be negative.\n\nSo T must be greater than 0. So 25 -x >0 \u2192 x <25. So x can be any value less than 25. So the difference between R and Q is x, which can be any value from 0 up to just under 25. So the difference isn't fixed; it can vary. So the answer is that we can't determine the definite difference. Therefore, the correct option is D) Cannot be determined.\n\nWait, but the options are given, and option D is 'Cannot be determined'. So that's the answer.\n",

So substituting, R -25 =25 - (50 - R) => R -25 = R -25. Again, same as before.\n\nWait, so R - Q = (50 - T) -25 =25 - T. But since T =50 - R, R -25 =25 - (50 - R) \u2192 R -25 = R -25. Which is always true, but doesn't give a specific value.\n\nSo, without additional information, the difference between R and Q's age can't be determined. Because T can vary as long as R and T sum to 50, leading to R and T having different values which affect R - Q.\n\nWait a second, let me think of an example. Suppose T is 20. Then R would be 30 (since 20+30=50). Then Q is 25. So R - Q is 5. Alternatively, if T is 25, then R is 25. Then R - Q is 0. Or if T is 30, then R is 20. R - Q would be -5. So the difference can vary.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the difference between R and Q's age. So the absolute difference? Or just R-Q? The question says \"difference between R and Q's age\". So in the first example, R=30, Q=25. Difference is 5. In the second, R=25, Q=25. Difference is 0. Third, R=20, Q=25. Difference is -5, but absolute is 5. Hmm, but the question doesn't specify absolute, just 'difference'. So depending on the situation, the difference can be positive or negative, but the magnitude can vary.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check. The problem says Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So, if Q is younger than R by x years, and older than T by x years. So R = Q + x, and T = Q - x. So R + T = (Q +x) + (Q -x) )= 2Q. Which is 50, so Q=25. So x is the difference between R and Q, which is the same as the difference between Q and T.\n\nWait, so in this case, R =25 +x, T=25 -x. So R + T =50. So the difference between R and Q is x. But the problem doesn't give us x. So x can be any value, as long as T is positive. Because age can't be negative.\n\nSo T must be greater than 0. So 25 -x >0 \u2192 x <25. So x can be any value less than 25. So the difference between R and Q is x, which can be any value from 0 up to just under 25. So the difference isn't fixed; it can vary. So the answer is that we can't determine the definite difference. Therefore, the correct option is D) Cannot be determined.\n\nWait, but the options are given, and option D is 'Cannot be determined'. So that's the answer.\n\n\nThe problem states that \"Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T,\" which implies that the difference between R and Q is the same as the difference between Q and T. Denoting Q, R, and T as their respective ages, this relationship can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nR - Q = Q - T\n\\]\n\nRearranging this equation gives:\n\n\\[\nR + T = 2Q\n\\]\n\nAdditionally, the problem states that the sum of R and T's ages is 50 years:\n\n\\[\nR + T = 50\n\\]\n\nEquating the two expressions for \\( R + T \\), we find:\n\n\\[\n2Q = 50 \\implies Q = 25\n\\]\n\nNow, the question asks for the difference between R and Q's age, \\( R - Q \\). From the earlier relationship \\( R - Q = Q - T \\), we know that \\( R - Q \\) is equal to \\( Q - T \\). However, without additional information about T's age, the value of \\( R - Q \\) cannot be uniquely determined. For example:\n\n1. If \\( T = 20 \\), then \\( R = 30 \\) (since \\( R + T = 50 \\)), and \\( R - Q = 30 - 25 = 5 \\).\n2. If \\( T = 25 \\), then \\( R = 25 \\) (since \\( R + T = 50 \\)), and \\( R - Q = 25 - 25 = 0 \\).\n3. If \\( T = 30 \\), then \\( R = 20 \\) (since \\( R + T = 50 \\)), and \\( R - Q = 20 - 25 = -5 \\).\n\nThus, the difference \\( R - Q \\) depends on the value of T, which is not provided. Since the problem does not specify T's age, the difference between R and Q's age cannot be definitively determined.\n\nAnswer: D",

The question says that Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. Hmm, that wording can be a bit tricky, but I think it means that the difference between Q and R's ages is the same as the difference between Q and T's ages, but in opposite directions.\n\nWait, let me parse that again. \"Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T.\" So, the amount by which Q is younger than R is equal to the amount by which Q is older than T. So, if Q is x years younger than R, then he must be x years older than T. So, R is Q + x, and T is Q - x. Or wait, no, because if Q is younger than R by x, that means R is Q + x. And since Q is older than T by x, T must be Q - x. Oh wait, no, that's not right. Because if Q is older than T by x, then T is Q minus x. Right, that makes sense.\n\nSo, R is Q plus x, and T is Q minus x. Now, the sum of R and T's ages is given as 50 years. So, R + T = 50.

Oh, wait, so Q is 25 years old.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the difference between R and Q's age. So R is Q + x, so R - Q = x. So the difference is x. But how do I find x?\n\nWait, I think I have another equation. Because the sum of R and T is 50, and from the way we set R and T, their sum is 2Q, which we found to be 50. So Q is 25. But that doesn't directly give me x, because x could be any value, right?\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's see. The problem gives me that the sum of R and T is 50. From my earlier substitution, that sum is 2Q, so Q is 25. But that doesn't give me x. So, without knowing x, I can't find the difference between R and Q, which is x.\n\nWait, but wait a second.

It seems like x isn't determined by the given information.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again. Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So, the difference between R and Q is the same as the difference between Q and T. So R = Q + d, and T = Q - d, where d is the difference. Then, R + T = (Q +d) + (Q -d) = 2Q =50. So Q=25. So R is 25 +d, T is 25 -d. \n\nThe question is asking for the difference between R and Q, which is d. But from the given information, I don't have any other constraints, so d could be any value.
