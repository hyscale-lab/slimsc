      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a fan blade, and I need to find out how far a point on the edge travels in a certain time. Hmm, let me think through it step by step.\n\nThe problem says the point is on the edge of a fan blade rotating in a plane, 10 centimeters from the center. So, the radius here is 10 cm. Got that. The fan runs at 300 revolutions per minute. Oh wait, and we're looking at the distance traveled after 30 seconds. \n\nWait, so I remember that the distance traveled by a point on the circumference is related to the circumference of the circle it's moving along. The formula for the circumference is 2 * pi * r, right? So with r being 10 cm, the circumference would be 2 * pi * 10, which is 20 pi cm per revolution.\n\nBut the fan is moving at 300 revolutions per minute. I need to find out how many revolutions happen in 30 seconds. Oh, because the time given is in seconds, and the rate is per minute. Let me convert that. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 30 seconds is half a minute. So if it's 300 revolutions per minute, in 30 seconds it would be 150 revolutions. Wait, because 300 * 0.5 is 150. That makes sense.\n\nSo each revolution, the point travels 20 pi cm. So for 150 revolutions, the total distance would be 150 * 20 pi. Let me calculate that. 150 times 20 is 3000, so 3000 pi cm. Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 3000 pi. So that would be the answer, right?\n\nWait, let me double-check. Alternative approach: maybe using angular velocity. The angular speed in radians per second. Hmm, 300 rev per minute is 300/60 =5 rev per second. Each revolution is 2 pi radians, so 5 * 2 pi = 10 pi rad/s. The time is 30 seconds. So the total angle is 10 pi *30=300 pi radians.\n\nThen, the distance traveled is the arc length, which is r * theta. r is 10 cm, theta is 300 pi. So 10 * 300 pi is 3000 pi cm. Yep, same answer as before. So that's consistent.\n\nSo the answer should be D)3000 pi.\n",

The question is about finding the distance traveled by a point on the edge of a fan blade after a certain time. \n\nAlright, let's break it down. The fan blade is rotating, and the point in question is on the edge, which means it's moving in a circular path.

Oh, right, I'll need to convert the time into minutes or adjust the revolutions per minute accordingly. The time is 30 seconds. Since 1 minute is 60 seconds, 30 seconds is half a minute, so 0.5 minutes.\n\nSo, the fan does 300 revolutions each minute.

The fan is doing 300 rev per minute, so that's 300 rev/min. To convert to radians per second: 300 rev/min is 300 * 2pi radians per minute. So 300 * 2pi = 600 pi rad/min.

So v = 10 pi * 10 cm/s? Wait, no, 10 pi rad/s multiplied by 10 cm gives v = 100 pi cm/s.\n\nThen, time is 30 seconds. So distance is speed * time = 100 pi *30 = 3000 pi cm. Yep, same result.

The radius of the circle is 10 cm, so the circumference is:  \n\\[\n\\text{Circumference} = 2 \\pi r = 2 \\pi \\times 10 = 20 \\pi \\, \\text{cm}.\n\\]  \nThe total distance traveled by the point is the number of revolutions multiplied by the circumference:  \n\\[\n\\text{Total distance} = 150 \\, \\text{rev} \\times 20 \\pi \\, \\text{cm/rev} = 3000 \\pi \\, \\text{cm}.\n\\]  \n\nThus, the distance traveled by the point after 30 seconds is **3000\u03c0 cm**.\n\nAnswer: D",

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe question says: A point on the edge of a fan blade is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center. We need to find the distance traveled by this point after 30 seconds when the fan runs at 300 revolutions per minute. The options are A to E, with various pi multiples.\n\nAlright, first, let me recall what I know. Rotational motion, right. The point on the edge is moving in a circular path. So the distance it travels would be the circumference of the circle multiplied by the number of revolutions it makes in the given time.\n\nWait, the key here is to find out how many revolutions happen in 30 seconds and then calculate the total distance.\n\nSo, the fan runs at 300 revolutions per minute. Wait, but the time given is 30 seconds, which is half a minute. So, first, I need to convert the time into minutes or adjust the RPM accordingly.\n\nWait, 30 seconds is 0.5 minutes. So, the number of revolutions in 30 seconds would be 300 rev/min * 0.5 min. Let me calculate that: 300 * 0.5 is 150 revolutions. So, the point makes 150 full circles in 30 seconds.\n\nEach revolution is a full circle, so the circumference would be the distance traveled in one revolution. The radius is given as 10 cm. The formula for circumference is 2 * pi * r. So, 2 * pi * 10 cm is 20 pi cm per revolution.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, radius is 10 cm, so circumference is 2 * pi * r, which is 2 * pi * 10 = 20 pi cm. So each revolution, the point travels 20 pi cm.\n\nSo, total distance is number of revolutions multiplied by circumference. That's 150 rev * 20 pi cm/rev.\n\nLet me compute that. 150 * 20 is 3000. So, 3000 pi cm. Oh, but wait, looking at the options, D is 3000 pi. But wait, let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, wait another thing. Wait, the fan is rotating at 300 rev per minute. So in 1 minute (60 seconds), it does 300 rev. So in 30 seconds, which is half a minute, it does 150 rev, that's correct.\n\nEach rev is 20 pi cm. So 150 * 20 pi = 3000 pi cm. So the total distance is 3000 pi cm.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3000 pi. So the correct answer should be D.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again. Did I make a mistake in units? The time is in seconds, but the RPM is given in per minute. Oh, right, because RPM is per minute, so 30 seconds is 0.5 minutes. So 300 * 0.5 is 150 revs. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: find the angular velocity in radians per second and multiply by the radius and time. Let me try that.\n\nAngular velocity (omega) is 300 rev per minute. Each rev is 2 pi radians. So omega = 300 * 2 pi rad/min. But that's per minute, so we need to convert to per second.\n\n300 rev/min is 300 rev/60 seconds = 5 rev/sec. So omega is 5 * 2 pi = 10 pi rad/sec.\n\nThen, the linear speed (v) is omega * r. So v = 10 pi * 10 cm = 100 pi cm/s.\n\nThen, distance is v * time. Time is 30 sec. So 100 pi * 30 = 3000 pi cm. Yep, same answer.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is D) 3000 pi.\n",

The time of rotation is 30 seconds.\n\n### Step 1: Convert revolutions per minute to revolutions per second\nSince there are 60 seconds in a minute, the fan rotates at:\n\\[\n\\text{Revolutions per second} = \\frac{300 \\, \\text{rev}}{60 \\, \\text{s}} = 5 \\, \\text{rev/s}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the total number of revolutions in 30 seconds\nThe total number of revolutions in 30 seconds is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total revolutions} = 5 \\, \\text{rev/s} \\times 30 \\, \\text{s} = 150 \\, \\text{rev}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the circumference of the circular path\nThe circumference \\( C \\) of the circular path is given by:\n\\[\nC = 2 \\pi r = 2 \\pi \\times 10 \\, \\text{cm} = 20 \\pi \\, \\text{cm}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the total distance traveled\nThe total distance traveled by the point is the number of revolutions multiplied by the circumference:\n\\[\n\\text{Total distance} = 150 \\, \\text{rev} \\times 20 \\pi \\, \\text{cm/rev} = 3000 \\pi \\, \\text{cm}.\n\\]\n\n### Verification Using Angular Speed\nThe angular speed \\( \\omega \\) in radians per second is:\n\\[\n\\omega = 300 \\, \\text{rev/min} \\times 2 \\pi \\, \\text{rad/rev} \\times \\frac{1}{60 \\, \\text{s}} = 10 \\pi \\, \\text{rad/s}.\n\\]\nThe linear speed \\( v \\) is:\n\\[\nv = \\omega \\times r = 10 \\pi \\, \\text{rad/s} \\times 10 \\, \\text{cm} = 100 \\pi \\, \\text{cm/s}.\n\\]\nOver 30 seconds, the total distance is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total distance} = v \\times t = 100 \\pi \\, \\text{cm/s} \\times 30 \\, \\text{s} = 3000 \\pi \\, \\text{cm}.\n\\]\n\nBoth methods confirm that the total distance traveled is \\( 3000 \\pi \\, \\text{cm} \\).\n\n**Answer: D**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to rotational motion, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe question says: A point on the edge of a fan blade is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center. I need to find the distance traveled by this point after 30 seconds when the fan runs at 300 revolutions per minute. The options are given as A to E, each a multiple of pi.\n\nHmm, I remember that in circular motion, the distance traveled by a point on the circumference is related to the circumference of the circle and the number of revolutions. So, the key concepts here are probably revolutions, time, and the circumference.\n\nLet me break this down. First, I should find out how many revolutions the fan makes in one minute. The problem states it's 300 revolutions per minute. But the time given is 30 seconds, which is half a minute. So I need to calculate the number of revolutions in 30 seconds.\n\nWait, right. Since 30 seconds is half of a minute, the fan would complete half of 300 revolutions in that time. So 300 divided by 2 is 150 revolutions in 30 seconds. That makes sense.\n\nNow, each revolution is a full circle, which is 2pi radians. But wait, for distance traveled, I think I just need to calculate the circumference and multiply by the number of revolutions. Oh right, because each revolution moves the point along the circumference once.\n\nThe circumference of the circle is 2 * pi * radius. The radius here is 10 centimeters. So the circumference would be 2 * pi * 10 cm = 20 pi cm per revolution.\n\nSo each revolution, the point travels 20 pi cm. Now, over 150 revolutions, the total distance would be 150 * 20 pi cm.\n\nLet me compute that. 150 times 20 is 3000. So 3000 pi cm. Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 3000 pi. So is that the answer?\n\nWait a second, did I do that correctly? Let me double-check. 300 revolutions per minute, so in 30 seconds, which is 0.5 minutes, it's 300 * 0.5 = 150 revolutions. Each rev is circumference 2pi*r = 2pi*10 =20 pi cm. So 150 * 20 pi is indeed 3000 pi cm. So yes, option D.\n\nBut wait, another thought: the point is on the edge, so the radius is 10 cm, correct. So that part's right.\n\nHmm, but wait, another approach: find the angular velocity in radians per second, then multiply by time to get total radians, then multiply by radius to get arc length. Let me try that.\n\nAngular velocity (omega) is 300 revolutions per minute. Each revolution is 2pi radians, so omega in radians per minute is 300 * 2pi = 600 pi rad/min. To convert to radians per second, divide by 60. So 600 pi /60 =10 pi rad/s.\n\nTime is 30 seconds, so total angle theta is omega * time: 10 pi *30 = 300 pi radians.\n\nArc length s = r * theta. r is 10 cm. So s=10 * 300 pi =3000 pi cm. Same result. So yes, that's correct. So the answer should be D, 3000 pi.\n",

I'm a bit rusty on my rotational motion, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nThe question says the point is on the edge of a fan blade rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center. So, the radius is 10 cm. Right, because the distance from the center to the edge is the radius. Got that down.\n\nThe fan runs at 300 revolutions per minute, and we need to find the distance traveled after 30 seconds. Oh wait, time is given in seconds, and the rate is in minutes. I'll probably need to convert the time to minutes or adjust the revolutions per minute to revolutions per second.\n\nSo, first step, let's figure out how many revolutions the fan makes in 30 seconds. Since it's 300 revolutions per minute, that's 300 RPM. Let's convert 30 seconds to minutes because the rate is per minute. 30 seconds is half a minute, so 0.5 minutes.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, 30 seconds is 30/60 minutes, which is 0.5 minutes. So in 0.5 minutes, the fan makes 300 * 0.5 revolutions. Let me calculate that. 300 times 0.5 is 150 revolutions. So total of 150 revolutions in 30 seconds.\n\nBut wait, another approach: Maybe it's better to convert RPM to RPS (revolutions per second) and then multiply by time in seconds. Let me try that. 300 RPM is 300 revolutions per 60 seconds, so 300/60 = 5 revolutions per second. So 5 RPS. Then, 30 seconds would be 5 * 30 = 150 revolutions. Yep, same result. So 150 revolutions.\n\nNow, each revolution, the point on the edge of the blade travels a distance equal to the circumference of the circle it's moving in. The circumference is 2 * pi * radius. The radius is 10 cm, so circumference is 2 * pi * 10 = 20 pi cm per revolution.\n\nSo, for each revolution, the point goes 20 pi cm. So, for 150 revolutions, the total distance is 150 * 20 pi cm.

So 150 *20 pi is 3000 pi. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way: The angular speed is 300 rev per minute. So in 30 seconds (0.5 minutes), it's 300 * 0.5 = 150 rev. Each rev is circumference 2pi r = 20 pi. So 150 *20 pi = 3000 pi. Yep.\n\nSo the answer should be D) 3000pi.\n",
