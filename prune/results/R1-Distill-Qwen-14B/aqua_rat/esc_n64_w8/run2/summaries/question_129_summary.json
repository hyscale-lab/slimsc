      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it again. The difference between the squares of two numbers is 256,000, and their sum is 1000. I need to find which pair of numbers fits this. The options are A, B, C, D, or E. Hmm.\n\nWait, I remember that when dealing with the difference of squares, there's a formula. Oh right, a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 equals (a - b)(a + b). Oh, that might be useful here. Let's jot that down.\n\nSo, the problem says a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 256000. And a + b = 1000. Oh, wait, that's perfect because the formula uses both (a - b) and (a + b). So if I can find (a - b), I can solve for a and b.\n\nLet me set it up. Let me denote S as the sum (a + b) = 1000. And D as the difference (a - b). Then, a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = S*(a - b) = 256000. So S is 1000, so 1000 * D = 256000. So D must be 256000 / 1000, which is 256.\n\nWait, so (a - b) is 256. Now I have two equations: a + b = 1000 and a - b = 256. I can solve these two equations simultaneously.\n\nLet me add the two equations. Adding (a + b) and (a - b) gives 2a. So 1000 + 256 = 1256 = 2a. So a would be 1256 / 2, which is 628. Then, b would be a - 256, so 628 - 256 is 372. So the numbers are 628 and 372. Let me check the options: option B is 628 and 372. So that's one possibility.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me verify the calculations.\n\nSo a + b is 1000, a - b is 256. Adding them: 2a = 1256 \u2192 a = 628. Subtracting the second equation from the first: 2b = 1000 - 256 = 744 \u2192 b = 372. That seems correct.\n\nLet me check the squares. 628 squared: Let me compute 600\u00b2 is 360000, 28\u00b2 is 784, and the cross term 2*600*28 is 33600. So 600\u00b2 + 28\u00b2 + 2*600*28 = 360000 + 33600 + 784 = 360000 + 33600 is 393600 plus 784 is 394,384. \n\nNow 372 squared: 370\u00b2 is 136900, 2\u00b2 is 4, and 2*370*2 is 1480. So 136900 + 1480 is 138380 plus 4 is 138,384.\n\nNow subtracting the squares: 394384 - 138384 = 256000. Oh, that's exactly the given difference. So yes, the numbers are 628 and 372. So option B is correct.\n\nWait, but let me look at the options again. Option C is 640 and 360. Let me check their sum: 640 + 360 is 1000. Their squares: 640\u00b2 is 409600, 360\u00b2 is 129600. The difference is 409600 - 129600 = 280000. Which is higher than 256000. So that's not matching. So option C is out.\n\nOption A is 600 and 400. Sum is 1000. 600\u00b2 is 360000, 400\u00b2 is 160000. Difference is 200000. Not 256000. So A is wrong.\n\nSo the correct answer is B. So the answer is option B. But wait, wait. Let me think again. The question is, the difference between the squares is 256000, but which one is bigger? Because if a is 628 and b is 372, a is bigger, so a\u00b2 is bigger. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, what if I had done a - b = 256, but perhaps the problem says the difference is 256000, but it's a\u00b2 - b\u00b2. So I think my approach is correct.\n\nSo yes, the answer is option B. Therefore, the correct choice is B.\n",

I remember that when dealing with the difference of squares, there's a formula: a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a - b)(a + b). Oh right, that's the identity they taught us. So maybe I can use that here.\n\nWait, the problem gives us the difference of the squares (256000) and the sum of the numbers (1000). So let's write down what we know.\n\nLet me denote the two numbers as a and b, where a is larger than b. So, a + b = 1000, and a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 256000.\n\nUsing the identity, a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a - b)(a + b).

Since I know a + b is 1000 and a - b is 256, the product (a + b)(a - b) is 1000 * 256 = 256000, which matches the given difference of squares. So that checks out.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the squares. Let's compute 628^2:\n\n628 * 628. Hmm, 600^2 is 360000, 28^2 is 784, and the cross term is 2 * 600 * 28 = 33600.

And the difference of their squares is 256000. So, substituting into the identity, I get:\n\nx\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = (x + y)(x - y) = 256000.\n\nBut I already know that x + y is 1000. So plugging that in:\n\n1000 * (x - y) = 256000.\n\nSo, to find (x - y), I can divide both sides by 1000. Let me calculate that.\n\n256000 / 1000 is 256. So, x - y = 256.\n\nNow I have two equations:\n\n1) x + y = 1000\n2) x - y = 256\n\nI can solve these two equations simultaneously. Let's add them together to eliminate y.\n\nAdding equation 1 and 2:\n\n(x + y) + (x - y) = 1000 + 256\n2x = 1256\nSo, x = 1256 / 2 = 628.\n\nOnce I have x, I can find y by substituting back into equation 1.\n\n628 + y = 1000\ny = 1000 - 628 = 372.\n\nSo the two numbers are 628 and 372. Let me check the options. Option B is 628 and 372. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me verify the calculations.\n\nCalculating the sum: 628 + 372 = 1000. Yep, that's correct.\n\nCalculating the difference of squares: 628\u00b2 is ... let me compute that. 600\u00b2 is 360000, and 28\u00b2 is 784, and the cross term is 2*600*28=33600. So 628\u00b2 = (600+28)^2 = 600\u00b2 + 2*600*28 + 28\u00b2 = 360000 + 33600 + 784 = 360000 + 33600 is 393600, plus 784 is 394,384.\n\nSimilarly, 372\u00b2. Let's see, 370\u00b2 is 136900. 372 is 370 + 2, so (370+2)^2 = 370\u00b2 + 2*370*2 + 2\u00b2 = 136900 + 1480 +4 = 136900+1480 is 138380 +4 is 138384.\n\nNow, subtracting the squares: 394384 - 138384 = 256000. Yep, that's exactly the number given. So the calculations are correct.\n\nSo the answer should be option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here where the difference between the squares of two numbers is 256,000 and their sum is 1000. I need to find which pair of numbers fits this. The options are A, B, C, D, or E. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nWait, the problem gives me two equations. Let me denote the two numbers as x and y. So, x squared minus y squared equals 256,000. And the sum of x and y is 1000. Oh right, because x + y = 1000 and x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 256,000.\n\nI remember that x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 can be factored into (x + y)(x - y). That might be useful here. So substituting the known sum, which is 1000, into this equation would help. Let me write that down.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = (x + y)(x - y) = 256,000. Since x + y is 1000, I can plug that in. So 1000*(x - y) = 256,000. To find (x - y), I can divide both sides by 1000. That gives x - y = 256.\n\nWait, so now I have two equations: x + y = 1000 and x - y = 256. I can solve these two equations simultaneously. Adding them together would eliminate y. Let me add the two equations:\n\n(x + y) + (x - y) = 1000 + 256\n2x = 1256\nSo x = 1256 / 2 = 628.\n\nThen, substituting x back into x + y = 1000, I get y = 1000 - 628 = 372.\n\nSo the two numbers are 628 and 372. Let me check the options. Option B is 628 and 372, so that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me verify the calculations. Let me compute x\u00b2 and y\u00b2.\n\nx = 628. Let's compute 628 squared. Hmm, 600\u00b2 is 360,000. 28\u00b2 is 784. Then, the cross term is 2*600*28 = 33,600. So (600 +28)^2 = 600\u00b2 + 2*600*28 +28\u00b2 = 360,000 + 33,600 + 784 = 394,384.\n\ny = 372. Let's compute 372 squared. 300\u00b2 is 90,000. 72\u00b2 is 5,184. The cross term is 2*300*72 = 43,200. So (300 +72)^2 = 90,000 +43,200 +5,184 = 138,384.\n\nNow, the difference x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 is 394,384 - 138,384 = 256,000. Which matches the given value. So that's correct.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 628 and 372, which matches. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but the options also include C) 640,360. Let me quickly check that to make sure. If x is 640 and y is 360, their sum is 1000, which is correct. Now their squares: 640\u00b2 is 409,600 and 360\u00b2 is 129,600. The difference is 409,600 - 129,600 = 280,000. But that's not 256,000. So option C is wrong.\n\nSo yes, the correct answer is B.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding two numbers, \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), such that their sum is 1000 and the difference between their squares is 256,000. Using the equations:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 1000 \\)  \n2. \\( x^2 - y^2 = 256,000 \\)\n\nThe difference of squares can be factored as \\( x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y) \\). Substituting \\( x + y = 1000 \\) into this equation gives:\n\n\\[\n1000 \\cdot (x - y) = 256,000\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x - y \\):\n\n\\[\nx - y = \\frac{256,000}{1000} = 256\n\\]\n\nNow, we have two equations:  \n1. \\( x + y = 1000 \\)  \n2. \\( x - y = 256 \\)\n\nAdding these equations eliminates \\( y \\):\n\n\\[\n(x + y) + (x - y) = 1000 + 256 \\implies 2x = 1256 \\implies x = \\frac{1256}{2} = 628\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( x = 628 \\) back into \\( x + y = 1000 \\) gives:\n\n\\[\ny = 1000 - 628 = 372\n\\]\n\nThus, the two numbers are 628 and 372.

We're supposed to find which pair of numbers fits these conditions, and the options are given as A to E.\n\nHmm, right. So, let's break it down. Let me denote the two numbers as x and y, where x is larger than y, I suppose. So, the sum is x + y = 1000. And the difference of their squares is x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 256000.\n\nWait, I remember that the difference of squares can be factored. Yeah, x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 equals (x - y)(x + y). Oh right! So that's a useful identity here.\n\nSo, substituting the known sum into the equation, (x - y)(1000) = 256000. Because x + y is 1000. So, if I divide both sides by 1000, I get x - y = 256000 / 1000.

Let me add them together. Adding equation 1 and equation 2:\n\n(x + y) + (x - y) = 1000 + 256\n2x = 1256\nSo, x = 1256 / 2 = 628.\n\nThen, plugging x back into equation 1 to find y: 628 + y = 1000.

So, 628\u00b2 = (600 + 28)^2 = 600\u00b2 + 2*600*28 + 28\u00b2 = 360000 + 33600 + 784 = 360000 + 33600 is 393600, plus 784 is 394384.\n\nNow 372 squared: 372 is 370 + 2.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says that the difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000, and the sum of the numbers is 1000. We're supposed to find which pair of numbers fits these conditions, and the options are given as A to E.\n\nHmm, right. So, let's break it down. Let me denote the two numbers as x and y, where x is larger than y, I suppose. So, the sum is x + y = 1000. And the difference of their squares is x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 256000.\n\nWait, I remember that the difference of squares can be factored. Yeah, x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 equals (x - y)(x + y). Oh right! So that's a useful identity here.\n\nSo, substituting the known sum into the equation, (x - y)(1000) = 256000. Because x + y is 1000. So, if I divide both sides by 1000, I get x - y = 256000 / 1000. Let me calculate that.\n\n256000 divided by 1000 is 256. So, x - y = 256. Now I have two equations:\n\n1. x + y = 1000\n2. x - y = 256\n\nI can solve these two equations simultaneously. Let me add them together. Adding equation 1 and equation 2:\n\n(x + y) + (x - y) = 1000 + 256\n2x = 1256\nSo, x = 1256 / 2 = 628.\n\nThen, plugging x back into equation 1 to find y: 628 + y = 1000. So, y = 1000 - 628 = 372.\n\nWait, so the numbers are 628 and 372. Let me check the options. Option B is 628, 372. So that should be the answer.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me verify both conditions.\n\nFirst, the sum: 628 + 372 is 1000. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNow the difference of squares: 628\u00b2 minus 372\u00b2. Let me calculate that. Alternatively, I can use the difference of squares formula again, but maybe I'll just compute both squares.\n\nWait, 628 squared. Let me see: 600\u00b2 is 360,000. 28\u00b2 is 784. So, 628\u00b2 = (600 + 28)^2 = 600\u00b2 + 2*600*28 + 28\u00b2 = 360000 + 33600 + 784 = 360000 + 33600 is 393600, plus 784 is 394384.\n\nNow 372 squared: 372 is 370 + 2. So, 370\u00b2 is 136900. 2\u00b2 is 4. The cross term is 2*(370)*(2) = 1480. So, 372\u00b2 = 136900 + 1480 +4 = 136900 +1480 is 138380 +4=138384.\n\nSo, the difference is 394384 - 138384 = 256000. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the numbers are 628 and 372, which is option B.\n\nWait, but I should also check if any other options fit. Let's quickly look at the other options.\n\nOption A: 600 and 400. Sum is 1000, that's correct. Now difference of squares: 600\u00b2 is 360000, 400\u00b2 is 160000. The difference is 200,000, which is less than 256,000. So A is wrong.\n\nOption C: 640 and 360. Sum is 1000, correct. 640\u00b2 is 409600, 360\u00b2 is 129600. The difference is 409600 -129600 = 280000. Which is more than 256000. So C is incorrect.\n\nOption D is none of these, but we have a correct option in B, so D is wrong. E says cannot be determined, but we found a solution, so E is wrong.\n\nSo the correct answer is B.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding two numbers, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), such that their sum is 1000 and the difference of their squares is 256,000. Using the identity for the difference of squares, \\(x^2 - y^2 = (x - y)(x + y)\\), and substituting the given sum \\(x + y = 1000\\), we find:\n\n\\[\n(x - y)(1000) = 256,000 \\implies x - y = \\frac{256,000}{1000} = 256\n\\]\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n1. \\(x + y = 1000\\)\n2. \\(x - y = 256\\)\n\nAdding these equations:\n\\[\n(x + y) + (x - y) = 1000 + 256 \\implies 2x = 1256 \\implies x = 628\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(x = 628\\) into \\(x + y = 1000\\):\n\\[\n628 + y = 1000 \\implies y = 372\n\\]\n\nThus, the numbers are 628 and 372. Verifying the conditions:\n- Their sum is \\(628 + 372 = 1000\\), which is correct.\n- Their squares are \\(628^2 = 394,384\\) and \\(372^2 = 138,384\\), and the difference is \\(394,384 - 138,384 = 256,000\\), which matches the given condition.\n\nChecking the options:\n- **Option A**: 600 and 400. Their sum is 1000, but their squares' difference is \\(600^2 - 400^2 = 360,000 - 160,000 = 200,000\\), which is incorrect.\n- **Option B**: 628 and 372.

This is incorrect because option B is correct.\n- **Option E**: Cannot be determined. This is incorrect because the solution is uniquely determined.\n\nThe correct answer is **B) 628, 372**.\n\nAnswer: B",
