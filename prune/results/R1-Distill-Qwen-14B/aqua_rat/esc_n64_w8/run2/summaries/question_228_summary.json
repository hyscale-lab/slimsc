      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about selecting balls from a box. Let me read it again and try to figure it out step by step. \n\nThe problem says: A box contains balls marked from 1 to n. There are 45 different ways to select two balls such that the ball with number 3 isn't selected. We need to find n.\n\nHmm. Right, so I'm supposed to calculate the number of ways to choose two balls without picking the 3. And that number is 45. So I need to find n such that the number of ways to choose two balls from (n-1) balls (excluding 3) is 45.\n\nWait, no, wait. Because the total number of possible pairs without 3 would be the combination of (n-1) choose 2, since we're excluding ball 3. Because normally, the total combinations would be n choose 2, but without 3, it's (n-1) choose 2.\n\nSo the equation should be C(n-1, 2) = 45. Let me write that down:\n\nC(n-1, 2) = 45.\n\nI remember that the combination formula is C(k, 2) = k*(k-1)/2. So substituting k = n-1:\n\n(n-1)*(n-2)/2 = 45.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n(n-1)(n-2) = 90.\n\nNow I need to find integer n where (n-1)(n-2) equals 90. Let's compute this.\n\nLet me think of factors of 90. Let's list the factor pairs:\n\n1 and 90 \u2192 1*90=90 \u2192 n-1=90 \u2192 n=91? That seems too big. Or perhaps n-1=90 and n-2=90-1=89? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the factors are consecutive numbers. Because (n-1) and (n-2) are consecutive integers. So what consecutive integers multiply to 90?\n\nLet me see: 9 and 10 multiply to 90, because 9*10=90. So if (n-1)=10 and (n-2)=9, then n-1=10 \u2192 n=11. Let me check that:\n\n(11-1)*(11-2) = 10 *9=90. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo n is 11. Looking at the options, A is 11.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So the number of ways without 3 is 45. So if n is 11, the total number of balls is 11. So without 3, we have 10 balls. The number of ways to choose two is C(10,2)=45. Because 10*9/2=45. Yep, that's right.\n\nAlternatively, if I had picked another pair of consecutive integers, like 5 and 6: 5*6=30, which is less than 90. 8*9=72, still less. 9*10=90, which works. So n=11 is correct.\n\nSo the answer should be option A, 11.\n",

So if I'm not selecting ball number 3, that means I'm only selecting from the other balls. So the total number of balls I can choose from is n minus 1. Because ball 3 is excluded.\n\nThe number of ways to choose two balls from a set is given by combinations.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let's read it again and try to understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says: There's a box with balls numbered from 1 to n. We need to find n such that there are 45 different ways to choose two balls without selecting the one marked 3. So, the number of ways to pick two balls without including ball 3 is 45. We have options from A to E, and I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nHmm. I remember that when dealing with combinations, the number of ways to choose k items from a set of m is given by the combination formula C(m, k) = m!/(k! (m-k)! ). So, in this case, the total number of ways to choose any two balls from n balls is C(n,2). But wait, the problem says that the number of ways without selecting ball 3 is 45. So, that means we're considering all possible pairs except those that include ball 3.\n\nWait, so maybe another approach: the total number of ways to choose two balls from n is C(n,2). But the number of ways that include ball 3 is C(n-1,1), because if ball 3 is selected, the other ball can be any of the remaining (n-1) balls. So the number of pairs without ball 3 would be total pairs minus the pairs that include ball 3. So, it's C(n,2) - (n-1) = 45.\n\nLet me write that equation down:\n\nC(n, 2) - (n - 1) = 45.\n\nLet me compute C(n,2). C(n,2) is n(n-1)/2. So substituting:\n\nn(n-1)/2 - (n-1) = 45.\n\nHmm, factor out (n-1):\n\n(n-1)(n/2 - 1) )= 45.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to compute it step by step. Let me expand the equation.\n\nn(n-1)/2 - (n-1) =45.\n\nLet me factor out (n-1):\n\n(n-1) [n/2 - 1] = 45.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute each term separately.\n\nLet me compute C(n,2) = [n(n-1)]/2.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n[n(n-1)/2] - (n-1) =45.\n\nFactor (n-1) from both terms:\n\n(n-1) [ (n/2) - 1 ] =45.\n\nHmm, so (n-1)( (n-2)/2 ) =45.\n\nBecause (n/2 -1) is the same as (n-2)/2. So, (n-1)(n-2)/2 =45.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n(n-1)(n-2) =90.\n\nSo now, I need to find integer n where (n-1)(n-2)=90.\n\nLet me compute 90's factors and see which pair is two consecutive numbers.\n\nLooking for two consecutive integers whose product is 90.\n\nLet's see: 9*10=90. Oh wait, 9 and 10 are consecutive. So, (n-1) and (n-2) are 9 and 10, but wait, no, because (n-1) is larger than (n-2). Wait, wait, no, 10 is larger than 9. So if (n-1) is 10, then (n-2) is 9. Because 10*9=90.\n\nSo, (n-1)=10 \u2192 n=11.\n\nWait, but let's check. If n=11, then (11-1)=10, (11-2)=9. 10*9=90. Yes, that works.\n\nSo n is 11. Let me check the options. Option A is 11. So the answer would be A.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the equation. Let me re-derive:\n\nNumber of ways without ball 3: total pairs - pairs including ball 3.\n\nTotal pairs: C(n,2) = n(n-1)/2.\n\nPairs including ball 3: the other ball can be any of the remaining (n-1) balls, so C(n-1,1) = n-1.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\nC(n,2) - (n-1) =45.\n\nSo,\n\n[n(n-1)/2] - (n-1) =45.\n\nFactor (n-1):\n\n(n-1)(n/2 -1) )=45.\n\nWait, I think earlier I converted n/2 -1 correctly to (n-2)/2, so (n-1)(n-2)/2=45.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: (n-1)(n-2)=90.\n\nWhich gives n-1=10 and n-2=9, so n=11.\n\nSo yes, n=11. So the correct option is A)11.\n\nWait, but let me test with n=11.\n\nTotal pairs: C(11,2)= (11*10)/2=55.\n\nPairs including 3: 10 (since 3 can pair with 1-2,4-11, which is 10 balls).\n\nSo pairs without 3: 55-10=45. Which matches the condition.\n\nSo yes, n=11 is correct.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let's read it again and try to understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says: There's a box with balls numbered from 1 to n. We need to find n such that there are 45 different ways to choose two balls without selecting the one marked 3. So, the number of ways to pick two balls without including ball 3 is 45. We have options from A to E, and I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nHmm. I remember that when dealing with combinations, the number of ways to choose k items from a set of m is given by the combination formula C(m, k) = m!/(k! (m-k)! ). So, in this case, the total number of ways to choose any two balls from n balls is C(n,2). But wait, the problem says that the number of ways without selecting ball 3 is 45. So, that means we're considering all possible pairs except those that include ball 3.\n\nWait, so maybe another approach: the total number of ways to choose two balls from n is C(n,2). But the number of ways that include ball 3 is C(n-1,1), because if ball 3 is selected, the other ball can be any of the remaining (n-1) balls. So the number of pairs without ball 3 would be total pairs minus the pairs that include ball 3. So, it's C(n,2) - (n-1) = 45.\n\nLet me write that equation down:\n\nC(n, 2) - (n - 1) = 45.\n\nLet me compute C(n,2). C(n,2) is n(n-1)/2. So substituting:\n\nn(n-1)/2 - (n-1) = 45.\n\nHmm, factor out (n-1):\n\n(n-1)(n/2 - 1) )= 45.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to compute it step by step. Let me expand the equation.\n\nn(n-1)/2 - (n-1) =45.\n\nLet me factor out (n-1):\n\n(n-1) [n/2 - 1] = 45.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute each term separately.\n\nLet me compute C(n,2) = [n(n-1)]/2.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n[n(n-1)/2] - (n-1) =45.\n\nFactor (n-1) from both terms:\n\n(n-1) [ (n/2) - 1 ] =45.\n\nHmm, so (n-1)( (n-2)/2 ) =45.\n\nBecause (n/2 -1) is the same as (n-2)/2. So, (n-1)(n-2)/2 =45.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n(n-1)(n-2) =90.\n\nSo now, I need to find integer n where (n-1)(n-2)=90.\n\nLet me compute 90's factors and see which pair is two consecutive numbers.\n\nLooking for two consecutive integers whose product is 90.\n\nLet's see: 9*10=90. Oh wait, 9 and 10 are consecutive. So, (n-1) and (n-2) are 9 and 10, but wait, no, because (n-1) is larger than (n-2). Wait, wait, no, 10 is larger than 9. So if (n-1) is 10, then (n-2) is 9. Because 10*9=90.\n\nSo, (n-1)=10 \u2192 n=11.\n\nWait, but let's check. If n=11, then (11-1)=10, (11-2)=9. 10*9=90. Yes, that works.\n\nSo n is 11. Let me check the options. Option A is 11. So the answer would be A.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the equation. Let me re-derive:\n\nNumber of ways without ball 3: total pairs - pairs including ball 3.\n\nTotal pairs: C(n,2) = n(n-1)/2.\n\nPairs including ball 3: the other ball can be any of the remaining (n-1) balls, so C(n-1,1) = n-1.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\nC(n,2) - (n-1) =45.\n\nSo,\n\n[n(n-1)/2] - (n-1) =45.\n\nFactor (n-1):\n\n(n-1)(n/2 -1) )=45.\n\nWait, I think earlier I converted n/2 -1 correctly to (n-2)/2, so (n-1)(n-2)/2=45.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: (n-1)(n-2)=90.\n\nWhich gives n-1=10 and n-2=9, so n=11.\n\nSo yes, n=11. So the correct option is A)11.\n\nWait, but let me test with n=11.\n\nTotal pairs: C(11,2)= (11*10)/2=55.\n\nPairs including 3: 10 (since 3 can pair with 1-2,4-11, which is 10 balls).\n\nSo pairs without 3: 55-10=45. Which matches the condition.\n\nSo yes, n=11 is correct.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the value of \\( n \\) such that there are 45 ways to select two balls from a box containing balls numbered 1 to \\( n \\), excluding the ball marked 3.\n\n### Step 1: Total number of ways to select two balls\nThe total number of ways to select two balls from \\( n \\) balls is given by the combination formula:\n\\[\nC(n, 2) = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Number of ways including ball 3\nIf ball 3 is selected, the other ball can be any of the remaining \\( n-1 \\) balls. Thus, the number of ways to select two balls including ball 3 is:\n\\[\nC(n-1, 1) = n-1.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Number of ways excluding ball 3\nThe number of ways to select two balls without including ball 3 is:\n\\[\nC(n, 2) - (n-1).\n\\]\nAccording to the problem, this equals 45:\n\\[\n\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} - (n-1) = 45.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Simplify the equation\nFactor out \\( (n-1) \\):\n\\[\n(n-1)\\left(\\frac{n}{2} - 1\\right) = 45.\n\\]\nSimplify further:\n\\[\n(n-1)\\left(\\frac{n-2}{2}\\right) = 45.\n\\]\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\\[\n(n-1)(n-2) = 90.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Solve for \\( n \\)\nWe need two consecutive integers whose product is 90. These are 9 and 10. Thus:\n\\[\nn-1 = 10 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad n-2 = 9.\n\\]\nThis gives:\n\\[\nn = 11.\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Verify the solution\nIf \\( n = 11 \\), the total number of ways to select two balls is:\n\\[\nC(11, 2) = \\frac{11 \\cdot 10}{2} = 55.\n\\]\nThe number of ways including ball 3 is:\n\\[\n11 - 1 = 10.\n\\]\nThus, the number of ways excluding ball 3 is:\n\\[\n55 - 10 = 45,\n\\]\nwhich matches the condition.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe value of \\( n \\) is **11**.\n\nAnswer: A",

I need to find n.\n\nHmm, right. So the total number of ways to choose two balls without the 3 is 45. Wait, but how do I approach this?\n\nI remember that the number of ways to choose two items from a set is given by combinations. The formula for combinations is C(k, m) = m!/(k!(m-k)!), where m is the total number of items, and k is the number we're choosing.\n\nSo, in this case, the total number of balls is n, but we're excluding the ball numbered 3. So the number of balls we can choose from is n-1 (since 3 is excluded). So the number of ways to choose two balls from the remaining n-1 balls is C(n-1, 2).\n\nAnd according to the problem, this equals 45. So I can set up the equation:\n\nC(n-1, 2) = 45\n\nLet me write that out. The combination formula for choosing 2 from (n-1) is (n-1)(n-2)/2 = 45. Because C(m, 2) is m(m-1)/2.\n\nSo, expanding that:\n\n(n-1)(n-2)/2 = 45\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n(n-1)(n-2) = 90\n\nNow I need to solve this quadratic equation. Let's expand the left side:\n\nn\u00b2 - 3n + 2 = 90\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me compute (n-1)(n-2). \n\n(n-1)(n-2) = n\u00b2 - 2n - n + 2 = n\u00b2 -3n + 2. \n\nSo,\n\nn\u00b2 -3n +2 =90\n\nSubtract 90 from both sides:\n\nn\u00b2 -3n -88 = 0\n\nNow, I need to solve for n. Let's try factoring or using the quadratic formula. Let's see if it factors.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -88 and add to -3.\n\nLet me think: factors of 88 are 1, 88; 2,44; 4,22; 8,11.\n\nWait, so 8 and 11. Since the product is -88, one must be positive and the other negative.\n\nSo, 8 and -11: 8 * (-11) = -88, and 8 + (-11) = -3. Yes, that works.\n\nSo the equation factors as (n - 11)(n +8) = 0.\n\nWait, wait. Let me check: (n - 11)(n +8) = n\u00b2 +8n -11n -88 = n\u00b2 -3n -88. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the solutions are n=11 and n=-8. Since the number of balls can't be negative, n must be 11.\n\nWait, but let me check the options. The options are A)11, B)10, C)9, D)8, E)7.\n\nSo the answer should be A)11.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me plug n=11 back into the original problem.\n\nIf n=11, the total number of balls is 11. The number of ways to choose two balls without the 3 is C(10, 2) = (10*9)/2=45. Yep, that matches the given condition. So yes, 11 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, just to be thorough, what if I thought n was 10? Then the number of balls excluding 3 is 9, so C(9,2)= 36, which is less than 45. So n can't be 10. Similarly, n=9: C(8,2)=28, which is way less. So yeah, 11 is the right answer.\n",

So the total number of ways to choose two balls from n is given by the combination formula C(n,2), which is n(n-1)/2. But since we're excluding the case where the ball with number 3 is selected, we need to subtract the number of pairs that include ball 3.\n\nSo, how many pairs include ball 3? Well, if 3 is one of the two balls, the other can be any of the remaining n-1 balls. So that's (n-1) pairs. So the number of ways without selecting 3 is the total pairs minus the pairs that include 3. That gives us C(n,2) - (n-1) = 45.\n\nLet me write that out as an equation: [n(n-1)/2] - (n-1) = 45.\n\nHmm, I can factor out (n-1) from both terms. So (n-1)(n/2 - 1) =45.

But since we're excluding the case where the ball with number 3 is selected, we need to subtract the number of pairs that include ball 3.\n\nSo, how many pairs include ball 3? Well, if 3 is one of the two balls, the other can be any of the remaining n-1 balls. So that's (n-1) pairs. So the number of ways without selecting 3 is the total pairs minus the pairs that include 3. That gives us C(n,2) - (n-1) = 45.\n\nLet me write that out as an equation: [n(n-1)/2] - (n-1) = 45.\n\nHmm, I can factor out (n-1) from both terms. So (n-1)(n/2 - 1) =45. Wait, let's see: [ (n-1) * (n/2 - 1) ] =45.\n\nAlternatively, I can rearrange the equation:\n\nn(n-1)/2 - (n-1) =45.\n\nLet me factor (n-1) out: (n-1)[n/2 - 1] =45.\n\nHmm, maybe I can factor this differently. Let's see, let's multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator.\n\nSo, 2* [ (n(n-1)/2) - (n-1) ] = 2*45 \u2192 n(n-1) - 2(n-1) =90.\n\nFactor (n-1) from both terms: (n-1)(n -2) ) =90.\n\nSo now the equation is (n-1)(n-2) =90.\n\nWait, so I need two consecutive numbers (since n-1 and n-2 are consecutive) whose product is 90. Let's think about factors of 90.\n\nLet me list the factor pairs of 90:\n\n1 and 90 \u2192 but 1 and 90 are not consecutive.\n\n2 and 45 \u2192 no.\n\n3 and 30 \u2192 no.\n\n5 and 18 \u2192 no.\n\n6 and 15 \u2192 no.\n\n9 and 10 \u2192 yes! 9 and 10 are consecutive.\n\nSo, (n-1) and (n-2) must be 10 and 9, respectively. Because 10*9=90.\n\nSo, n-1=10 \u2192 n=11.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check that. If n is 11, then n-1 is 10, n-2 is 9. So 10*9=90, which fits.\n\nSo, n=11.\n\nLet me double-check this. Let's compute the number of ways without selecting 3.\n\nTotal ways when n=11: C(11,2)= (11*10)/2 =55.\n\nNumber of pairs that include 3: 10 (since 3 can pair with 1,2,4,...11, which is 10 balls).\n\nSo the number of valid pairs is 55-10=45, which matches the condition. So yes, n=11 is the correct answer.\n\nLooking at the options, A is 11. So the answer should be A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the value of \\( n \\) such that there are 45 ways to select two balls from a box containing balls numbered 1 to \\( n \\), excluding the ball numbered 3.\n\n1. **Total number of ways to select two balls**:  \n   The total number of ways to choose two balls from \\( n \\) is given by the combination formula:  \n   \\[\n   C(n, 2) = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Number of pairs that include ball 3**:  \n   If ball 3 is included, it can pair with any of the remaining \\( n-1 \\) balls. Thus, there are \\( n-1 \\) such pairs.\n\n3. **Number of valid pairs (excluding ball 3)**:  \n   The number of ways to select two balls without including ball 3 is:  \n   \\[\n   C(n, 2) - (n-1) = 45.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Setting up the equation**:  \n   Substituting \\( C(n, 2) = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\) into the equation:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} - (n-1) = 45.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplifying the equation**:  \n   Factor out \\( (n-1) \\):  \n   \\[\n   (n-1)\\left(\\frac{n}{2} - 1\\right) = 45.\n   \\]  \n   Multiply through by 2 to eliminate the fraction:  \n   \\[\n   (n-1)(n - 2) = 90.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Solving for \\( n \\)**:  \n   We need two consecutive integers whose product is 90. The pairs of factors of 90 are:  \n   \\[\n   9 \\times 10 = 90.\n   \\]  \n   Thus, \\( n-1 = 10 \\) and \\( n-2 = 9 \\), which gives \\( n = 11 \\).\n\n7. **Verification**:  \n   For \\( n = 11 \\):  \n   - Total pairs: \\( C(11, 2) = \\frac{11 \\times 10}{2} = 55 \\).  \n   - Pairs including ball 3: \\( 10 \\).  \n   - Valid pairs: \\( 55 - 10 = 45 \\), which matches the condition.\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( n \\) is **11**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about balls in a box and combinations. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says there's a box with balls numbered from 1 to n. We need to find n such that the number of ways to choose two balls without selecting the one marked 3 is 45.\n\nWait, right. So, the total number of ways to choose any two balls without any restrictions would be the combination of n balls taken 2 at a time. The formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n!/(k! (n-k)!). So for two balls, that's n(n-1)/2.\n\nBut the problem says that the ball numbered 3 shouldn't be selected. So, we need to subtract the cases where the number 3 is selected. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the number of ways without selecting 3.\n\nWait, another approach: if we exclude the ball numbered 3, then we're only choosing from the remaining (n-1) balls. So the number of ways to choose two balls from (n-1) is (n-1 choose 2). And this is given as 45.\n\nSo, the equation would be (n-1)(n-2)/2 = 45.\n\nLet me write that down: (n-1)(n-2) = 90. Because when I multiply both sides by 2, 45*2 is 90.\n\nNow I need to solve for n. Let's expand the left side: (n-1)(n-2) = n\u00b2 -3n +2. So the equation is n\u00b2 -3n +2 =90. Subtract 90 from both sides to get n\u00b2 -3n -88 =0.\n\nHmm, solving the quadratic equation n\u00b2 -3n -88 =0. Let me use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is n = [3 \u00b1 sqrt(9 + 352)] / 2. Because the discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac, which is 9 + 352 (since 4*1*88 is 352, but wait, wait, 4ac is 4*1*88=352, and since it's -88, the equation is a=1, b=-3, c=-88. Wait, wait, I might have messed up the signs. Let me write it again.\n\nThe equation is n\u00b2 -3n -88 =0. So a=1, b=-3, c=-88. So discriminant D is b\u00b2 -4ac = (-3)^2 -4*(1)*(-88) = 9 + 352 = 361. The square root of 361 is 19.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about balls in a box and combinations. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says there's a box with balls numbered from 1 to n. We need to find n such that the number of ways to choose two balls without selecting the one marked 3 is 45.\n\nWait, right. So, the total number of ways to choose any two balls without any restrictions would be the combination of n balls taken 2 at a time. The formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n!/(k! (n-k)!). So for two balls, that's n(n-1)/2.\n\nBut the problem says that the ball numbered 3 shouldn't be selected. So, we need to subtract the cases where the number 3 is selected. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the number of ways without selecting 3.\n\nWait, another approach: if we exclude the ball numbered 3, then we're only choosing from the remaining (n-1) balls. So the number of ways to choose two balls from (n-1) is (n-1 choose 2). And this is given as 45.\n\nSo, the equation would be (n-1)(n-2)/2 = 45.\n\nLet me write that down: (n-1)(n-2) = 90. Because when I multiply both sides by 2, 45*2 is 90.\n\nNow I need to solve for n. Let's expand the left side: (n-1)(n-2) = n\u00b2 -3n +2. So the equation is n\u00b2 -3n +2 =90. Subtract 90 from both sides to get n\u00b2 -3n -88 =0.\n\nHmm, solving the quadratic equation n\u00b2 -3n -88 =0. Let me use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is n = [3 \u00b1 sqrt(9 + 352)] / 2. Because the discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac, which is 9 + 352 (since 4*1*88 is 352, but wait, wait, 4ac is 4*1*88=352, and since it's -88, the equation is a=1, b=-3, c=-88. Wait, wait, I might have messed up the signs. Let me write it again.\n\nThe equation is n\u00b2 -3n -88 =0. So a=1, b=-3, c=-88. So discriminant D is b\u00b2 -4ac = (-3)^2 -4*(1)*(-88) = 9 + 352 = 361. The square root of 361 is 19. So n = [3 \u00b119]/2.\n\nSo two possible solutions: [3 +19]/2 =22/2=11, and [3-19]/2 = (-16)/2= -8. But n can't be negative, so n=11.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If n=11, then the number of ways to choose two balls without the 3 is (11-1 choose 2) = 10C2. 10*9/2 is 45, which matches the given condition. So yes, n is 11.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 11.
