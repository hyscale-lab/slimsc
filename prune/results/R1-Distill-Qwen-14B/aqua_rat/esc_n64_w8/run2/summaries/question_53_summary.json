Let me read it again carefully. \n\nThe question says: Five dozen toys are packed in a box. So, first thing, I know a dozen is 12, right? So five dozen would be 5 times 12. Let me calculate that: 5 * 12 equals 60. So each box holds 60 toys. Got that down.\n\nNext part: 98 boxes are kept in a tempo. Hmm, a tempo is like a van or a truck used for transportation, I think. So each tempo can carry 98 boxes. And each box has 60 toys. So I guess I need to find out how many toys one tempo can carry in one trip. \n\nLet me compute that. If one tempo has 98 boxes, and each box has 60 toys, then per tempo, the number of toys is 98 multiplied by 60. Let me do the math. 98 * 60. Hmm, 100 times 60 is 6000, but since it's 98, I subtract 2 times 60. So 6000 minus 120 is 5880. So each tempo can carry 5880 toys in one round.\n\nThe question is asking, how many tempos are needed to lift 29400 toys in one round. So total toys needed is 29400. Each tempo can carry 5880 toys. I need to find how many such tempos are required to reach at least 29400 toys.\n\nSo the approach is to divide the total toys by the toys per tempo. So 29400 divided by 5880. Let me compute that. \n\nWait, 5880 times 5 is 29400 because 5880 * 5: 5000*5=25000, 800*5=4000, 80*5=400. Adding them up: 25000 +4000 is 29000, plus 400 is 29400. Oh, so 5880 *5 = 29400. That means exactly 5 tempos are needed.\n\nLooking at the options, B is 5. So the answer should be B.\n",

The options are A to E, with letters assigned to each number.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. I think I need to find out how many tempos are needed to carry 29400 toys. But wait, I'm not exactly sure how the numbers connect. Let me go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, five dozen toys in a box. Dozen is 12, right? So five dozen would be 5 multiplied by 12.

So I need to find out how many of these tempos are needed to carry 29400 toys at once.\n\nLet me break it down. First, find out how many toys one tempo can carry. Since each tempo holds 98 boxes, and each box has 60 toys, I multiply those two numbers.\n\nSo, 98 boxes/temo * 60 toys/box = let me calculate that. 98 times 60... 98*60. Let's see, 100*60 is 6000, minus 2*60 which is 120. So 6000-120=5880. So each tempo can carry 5880 toys in one round.\n\nNow, the total number of toys is 29400. I need to find how many tempos are needed to carry all of them. So I should divide the total toys by the toys one tempo can carry.\n\nSo 29400 divided by 5880. Let me compute that. Hmm, 5880 times 5 is 29400, right? Because 5880 *5: 5000*5=25000, 800*5=4000, 80*5=400, so 25000+4000=29000 +400=29400. So 5880*5=29400. So the number of tempos needed is 5.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 5. So the answer should be B.\n\n\nTo determine how many tempos are needed to carry 29,400 toys, we first calculate the number of toys one tempo can carry. Each box contains 5 dozen toys, which is \\( 5 \\times 12 = 60 \\) toys. Since each tempo holds 98 boxes, the total number of toys per tempo is:\n\n\\[\n98 \\, \\text{boxes/temo} \\times 60 \\, \\text{toys/box} = 5880 \\, \\text{toys/temo}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we find how many tempos are required to carry 29,400 toys. We divide the total number of toys by the number of toys one tempo can carry:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{29400 \\, \\text{toys}}{5880 \\, \\text{toys/temo}} = 5.\n\\]\n\nThus, 5 tempos are needed to carry 29,400 toys in one round.

Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe problem states: Five dozen toys are packed in a box, and 98 boxes are kept in a tempo. How many tempos can lift 29400 toys in one round?\n\nHmm, I need to find out how many tempos are needed to carry 29,400 toys in one trip. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I know that a dozen is 12. So five dozen toys would be 5 multiplied by 12. Let me calculate that. 5 * 12 = 60. So each box contains 60 toys.\n\nWait, the question says five dozen toys are packed in a box. So each box has 60 toys. Got it.\n\nNext, each tempo carries 98 boxes. Oh right, so each tempo can hold 98 boxes. And each of those boxes has 60 toys. So I need to find out how many toys one tempo can carry.\n\nSo the number of toys per tempo would be the number of boxes per tempo multiplied by the number of toys per box. That's 98 boxes * 60 toys/box. Let me do that math. 98 * 60. Hmm, 100*60 is 6000, minus 2*60 which is 120, so 6000-120=5880.

Maybe simplifying the numbers would help. Both numbers can be divided by 10, so that's 2940 \u00f7 588. Hmm, can I simplify further? Let's see if 588 divides into 2940 evenly.\n\nWait, 588 times 5 is 2940, because 500*5=2500, 88*5=440, 2500+440=2940. So yes, 5 times 588 is 2940. So 2940 \u00f7 588 =5. Therefore, 29,400 \u00f75,880=5.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So each tempo can carry 5,880 toys, and we need 5 tempos to carry 29,400 toys because 5 * 5,880 =29,400.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't make a calculation mistake. So 5,880 multiplied by 5 is indeed 29,400. Yep, because 5,000 *5 is 25,000, 880 *5 is 4,400, and 25,000 +4,400 is 29,400. So that's correct.\n\nLooking at the options: option B is 5.

Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe question says: Five dozen toys are packed in a box. Hmm, wait, five dozen. I remember that a dozen is 12, so five dozen would be 5 multiplied by 12. Let me calculate that. 5 times 12 is 60. So each box has 60 toys.\n\nNext part: 98 boxes are kept in a tempo. Oh, so each tempo can carry 98 boxes. But wait, each box has 60 toys. So I need to find out how many toys one tempo can carry.\n\nLet me do that. If one tempo has 98 boxes, each with 60 toys, then the total per tempo is 98 multiplied by 60. Let me compute that. Hmm, 98 times 60. Well, 100 times 60 is 6000, minus 2 times 60 which is 120. So 6000 minus 120 is 5880. So each tempo can carry 5880 toys.\n\nNow the question is, how many tempos are needed to lift 29400 toys in one round? So the total toys needed to be carried is 29400. We need to find how many tempos, each carrying 5880, are needed to reach or exceed 29400.\n\nLet me think. So I'll divide 29400 by 5880. Let's see, 5880 times 5 is 29400 exactly. Because 5880 *5: 5000*5=25000, 880*5=4400, 25000+4400=29400. So that's exactly 5. So each tempo carries 5880, 5 of them make 29400.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. 5880 * 5. Let me compute 5880 * 5. 5*5000 is 25000, 5*800 is 4000, 5*80 is 400, so 25000 +4000 is 29000, plus 400 is 29400. Yep, correct.\n\nSo the number of tempos needed is 5. Looking at the options, option B is 5. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Another way: 5880 * x = 29400. Solving for x, x = 29400 /5880. Let me compute that division. 5880 goes into 29400 exactly 5 times because 5880 *5 is 29400. So yeah, 5 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can simplify the division. Let's see, 29400 divided by 5880. Both numbers can be divided by 10, so 2940 / 588. Then, perhaps both can be divided by 42? Let me see: 2940 \u00f742=70, 588 \u00f742=14. So now it's 70/14, which is 5. So yes, same result.\n\nSo the answer is definitely 5. So option B.\n",
