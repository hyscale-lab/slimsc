      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about a man who spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 and a half percent of his income. We need to find out his monthly income. Hmm, right.\n\nWait, so he saves 12.5% of his income. That means the rest of his money is what he spends, right? Because if he saves a portion, the rest is his expenditure. So, 12.5% is saved, which implies that he spends 87.5% of his income because 100% minus 12.5% is 87.5%. Oh, right, because 12.5% is like one-eighth, so 1/8 is saved, and 7/8 is spent.\n\nSo the man spends Rs. 3500, which is 87.5% of his income. Let me think how to model this. Let's let his income be 'I'. Then, 87.5% of I equals 3500. So, in equation form, that's 0.875 * I = 3500.\n\nWait, but sometimes percentages can be tricky. Alternatively, 12.5% is 1/8, so maybe it's easier to think in fractions. If 12.5% is saved, that's 1/8 of his income, then the remaining 7/8 is spent. So, 7/8 of his income equals 3500.\n\nSo, 7/8 * I = 3500. To find I, we can rearrange the equation. Multiply both sides by 8/7. So I = 3500 * (8/7).\n\nLet me compute that. 3500 divided by 7 is 500, because 7*500 is 3500. Then multiply by 8, which gives 4000. So his income is Rs. 4000.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 4000. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If his income is 4000, 12.5% of that is 500. Because 4000 * 12.5% is 500. So he saves 500, and spends the rest, which is 4000 - 500 = 3500. Yes, that matches the given expenditure. So the calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way: 3500 is 87.5% of income. So 100% would be (3500 * 100) /87.5. Let me compute that. 3500 * 100 is 350000. Divided by 87.5. Hmm, 87.5 goes into 350000 how many times? Let's see, 87.5 * 4000 is 350,000 because 87.5 * 1000 is 87500, so 87500 *4 is 350,000. So yes, that also gives 4000.\n\nSo the answer is definitely option C.\n",

Since his income is the sum of his expenditure and savings, we have:\n\n\\[\nI = 3500 + \\frac{1}{8}I\n\\]\n\nRearranging the equation:\n\n\\[\nI - \\frac{1}{8}I = 3500\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7}{8}I = 3500\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by 8:\n\n\\[\n7I = 28,000\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 7:\n\n\\[\nI = 4000\n\\]\n\nThus, the man's monthly income is Rs. 4000. Verifying, 12.5% of 4000 is 500, and 4000 - 500 = 3500, which matches the given expenditure. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: C",

Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe problem says: A man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 1/2% of his income. His monthly income is?\n\nHmm, so he's spending 3500 and saving a certain percentage. I remember that when someone saves a percentage of their income, the amount saved plus the amount spent should equal the total income. So, his income is his expenditure plus his savings.\n\nWait, but let me think about it more clearly. The way it's phrased, he's saving 12.5% of his income. So, his savings are 12.5% of his total income, and the rest is what he's spending. That makes sense.\n\nSo, let me denote his monthly income as I. He saves 12.5% of I, which is 0.125 * I. And he spends 3500, which is the remaining part of his income. So, the equation would be:\n\nSavings + Expenditure = Income\n0.125 * I + 3500 = I\n\nAlternatively, since the savings are 12.5%, the amount he spends is 100% - 12.5% = 87.5% of his income. So another way to write the equation is:\n\n3500 = 0.875 * I\n\nOh, right, that might be easier. Because if I calculate 87.5% of I equals 3500, I can solve for I.\n\nSo, let me write that down:\n\n3500 = (87.5/100) * I\n\nWhich is the same as 3500 = 0.875 * I\n\nTo find I, I can rearrange the equation:\n\nI = 3500 / 0.875\n\nNow, I need to compute this. Let's see, what's 3500 divided by 0.875.\n\nHmm, 0.875 is the same as 7/8. Because 7 divided by 8 is 0.875. So, 3500 divided by (7/8) is the same as 3500 multiplied by (8/7).\n\nSo, 3500 * (8/7) = ?\n\nLet me compute that. Let's see, 3500 divided by 7 is 500. Because 7 times 500 is 3500. So, 500 times 8 is 4000. So, 3500 * (8/7) = 4000.\n\nSo, his monthly income is Rs. 4000.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is Rs. 4000, so that must be the answer. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, if I take the original approach where 0.125 * I is his savings, then:\n\n0.125 * I + 3500 = I\n=> 3500 = I - 0.125I\n=> 3500 = 0.875 I\nWhich again gives I = 3500 / 0.875 = 4000.\n\nYep, same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is C) Rs. 4000.\n",

The options are A) Rs. 4400, B) Rs. 4270, C) Rs. 4000, D) Rs. 3937.50, E) None of these.\n\nHmm, I think I need to find his total income based on his spending and savings. Let's break it down. He saves 12.5% of his income, and the rest he spends. So, his spending plus his savings should equal his total income.\n\nWait, no. Wait, actually, I think the way it works is that his income is split into two parts: the amount he spends and the amount he saves. So, if he saves 12.5%, then the remaining percentage must be what he spends. Let me calculate that.\n\n12.5% is the same as 1/8. So if he saves 1/8 of his income, then he spends the rest, which is 7/8. Because 1 minus 1/8 is 7/8. Right?\n\nSo, he spends 7/8 of his income, and that equals Rs. 3500. So, 7/8 of his income is 3500. I can set up the equation as:\n\n(7/8) * Income = 3500\n\nTo find the income, I can rearrange the equation. Multiply both sides by 8/7:\n\nIncome = 3500 * (8/7)\n\nLet me do that calculation. 3500 divided by 7 is 500. Then 500 multiplied by 8 is 4000. So, his income is Rs. 4000. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is Rs. 4000, so that should be the correct answer. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nSo, 12.5% is 1/8, so he saves 1/8 and spends 7/8. 7/8 of 4000 is 3500. Yes, that's correct. Because 4000 divided by 8 is 500, multiplied by 7 is 3500. That matches the amount he spends. So the calculations are correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this is to calculate the savings first. If he saves 12.5% of his income, then the amount he saves is (12.5/100) * Income. And since his spending is 3500, the savings would be (100 - 12.5)%, which is 87.5% of his income? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, actually, no. Wait, the spending is 3500, which is 100% minus 12.5%, so 87.5% of his income. Because 100% is the total, and he's saving 12.5% of that, so spending is 87.5%.\n\nWait, that's another way to think about it. Let me try that approach. So spending is 87.5% of income, which equals 3500.\n\nSo, (87.5/100)*Income = 3500\n\nSimplify 87.5% as a fraction: 87.5 is 7/8, right? Because 87.5 is 700/8, which is 87.5. So 87.5% is 7/8. So again, (7/8)*Income = 3500. Which leads us to the same equation as before. So, the income is 3500 * 8/7 = 4000. So, same result.\n\nAnother way to look at it: 12.5% is 1/8. So, if he saves 1/8, that's 4000*(1/8) = 500. So his savings are 500, and spending is 3500. 3500 + 500 is 4000. That makes sense.\n\nSo, all approaches lead me to conclude that the income is Rs. 4000. So the correct option is C.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. Option C is 4000.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out the man's monthly income based on the given information. Let's see, the problem says he spends Rs. 3500 each month and saves 12 and a half percent of his income. Hmm, I remember that percentage problems often involve finding either the part or the whole. In this case, I think the saving is a percentage of his income, so I need to find the total income.\n\nWait, let me get the details straight. He saves 12.5%, which is the same as 12 1/2%. So, that's 12.5% of his income. If his income is, say, I, then his savings would be 12.5% of I. And what he spends is Rs. 3500. So the total income must be the sum of what he spends and what he saves.\n\nRight, so the formula should be: Income = Expenditure + Savings. And Savings is 12.5% of Income. So, Savings = (12.5/100) * Income. \n\nPutting that together, Income = 3500 + (0.125 * Income). Oh, I can rearrange this equation to solve for Income. Let me write that down.\n\nLet me denote the income as I.\n\nI = 3500 + 0.125 * I\n\nHmm, I need to get I on one side. So, subtract 0.125 I from both sides.\n\nI - 0.125 I = 3500\n\nThat's 0.875 I = 3500\n\nSo, I = 3500 / 0.875\n\nWait, let me compute that. 3500 divided by 0.875. Let me think, 0.875 is the same as 7/8. So dividing by 7/8 is the same as multiplying by 8/7.\n\nSo, 3500 * (8/7) = ?\n\n3500 divided by 7 is 500. Then 500 multiplied by 8 is 4000. So I is 4000.\n\nWait, let me check another way. 0.875 is 7/8. So 3500 / 0.875 = 3500 * (8/7) = 4000. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo his income is Rs. 4000. Looking at the options, option C is 4000.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure. If he earns 4000, 12.5% is 500. So he saves 500, spends 3500. 3500 + 500 = 4000. Yep, that adds up.\n\nSo the correct answer should be C) Rs. 4000.\n",
