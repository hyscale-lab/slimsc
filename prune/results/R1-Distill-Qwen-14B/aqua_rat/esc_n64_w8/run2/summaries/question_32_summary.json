      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a map scale, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that the distance from Town F to Town G on the map is 20 inches. And on this map, 1/4 inch represents 10 miles. I need to find the actual distance in miles.\n\nHmm, right, map scales are all about converting the measured distance on the map to the real-world distance. So the first thing I should probably do is figure out how much one inch on the map corresponds to in real life. Because the given scale is 1/4 inch equals 10 miles, maybe I can find out what one inch equals.\n\nWait, so if 1/4 inch is 10 miles, then to find out what one inch is, I can multiply both sides by 4. Because 1/4 times 4 is 1. So 10 miles multiplied by 4 is 40. Oh wait, no, wait a second. Wait, no, wait. Because 1/4 inch equals 10 miles. So how much is one inch?\n\nLet me think. 1/4 inch is 10 miles. So for each 1/4 inch on the map, it's 10 miles in reality. So to find how many miles are in one inch, I can divide 10 by (1/4). Because 10 miles is for 1/4, so per inch, it's more. \n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps I can set it up as a ratio. So 1/4 inch : 10 miles. So 1 inch would be 10 miles multiplied by 4, right? Because 1 inch is four times 1/4 inch. So 10 miles *4 = 40 miles per inch. Oh wait, that can't be right because if 1/4 inch is 10 miles, then 1 inch is 40 miles. So then 20 inches would be 20 *40 = 800 miles. \n\nBut wait, let me check that again. 1/4 inch =10 miles. So 1 inch is 4*(10 miles) =40 miles. So 20 inches would be 20 *40 =800 miles. So that would make the answer 800 miles, which is option A.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes I see scales where 1 inch is equal to a certain number of miles, so maybe I should double-check. Let me think of another approach. Maybe using proportions.\n\nIf 1/4 inch equals 10 miles, then how many miles is 20 inches? So I can set up a proportion where (1/4 inch)/(10 miles) = 20 inches / x miles. Wait, wait no, perhaps I should think in terms of how many 1/4 inches are in 20 inches.\n\nSo each 1/4 inch is 10 miles. So how many 1/4 inches are in 20 inches? Let's calculate that. 20 divided by (1/4) is the same as 20 *4, which is 80. So there are 80 segments of 1/4 inch in 20 inches. Each of those segments is 10 miles, so total distance is 80 *10 =800 miles.\n\nSo that's the same answer as before. So the actual distance is 800 miles. Looking at the options, option A is 800, so that's the correct answer.\n",

I need to find out what the real distance is.\n\nWait, right. So, the map uses a scale where 1/4 inch equals 10 miles. That means each inch on the map corresponds to a certain number of miles. Oh, wait, wait. Let me think. If 1/4 inch is 10 miles, then how many miles is one inch? Because that would make it easier to calculate. So, if 0.25 inches (since 1/4 is 0.25) equals 10 miles, then one inch equals 10 divided by 0.25. Let me do that math: 10 divided by 0.25 is the same as 10 multiplied by 4, which is 40. So, one inch equals 40 miles. Oh, that's a big scale! So each inch is 40 miles.\n\nSo the road is 20 inches on the map. So to find the actual distance, I multiply the map distance by the number of miles per inch. So 20 inches multiplied by 40 miles per inch. Let me calculate that. 20 times 40 is 800.

Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nThe question says that on the map, the distance from Town F to Town G is 20 inches. Oh right, so the map isn't showing the real distance directly; it's scaled down or up. The scale given is 1/4 inch representing 10 miles. Wait, so 0.25 inches on the map equals 10 miles in real life.\n\nI think I need to find out how many miles one inch on the map corresponds to. So if 1/4 inch is 10 miles, then one inch must be four times that, right? Let me calculate that. 10 miles divided by 1/4 inch. Wait, division by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So 10 * 4 = 40. Oh, so one inch on the map is 40 miles in real life.\n\nBut wait, wait. No, wait. The scale says 1/4 inch equals 10 miles. So actually, for each 1/4 inch, it's 10 miles. So to find out how many miles one inch is, I can think of it as 4 times 10 miles, which is 40 miles per inch. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo now, the distance on the map is 20 inches. To find the actual distance, I multiply the number of inches by the miles per inch. So 20 inches * 40 miles/inch. Let me do the math: 20 * 40. Hmm, 20 times 4 is 80, so 20 times 40 is 800. Oh, so 800 miles. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the units. The scale is 1/4 inch equals 10 miles. So 1 inch is 40 miles. 20 inches would be 20 times 40, which is indeed 800. So the answer should be 800 miles.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 800. So the correct answer should be A.\n",

Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says that on a map, the road from Town F to Town G is 20 inches long. The scale is given as 1/4 inch representing 10 miles. I need to find the actual distance between the towns in miles. The options are A to E, with numbers like 800, 720, etc.\n\nHmm, I remember that map scales relate the distance on the map to the actual distance on the ground. So, the key here is to convert the measured inches on the map into real-world miles using the given scale.\n\nLet me think. The scale is 1/4 inch equals 10 miles. So, for every 0.25 inches on the map, it's 10 miles in reality. But the road is 20 inches on the map. I need to find out how many miles that 20 inches corresponds to.\n\nWait, maybe I should find out how many 1/4 inches are in 20 inches. Because each 1/4 inch is 10 miles. So, if I can find how many times 1/4 inch fits into 20 inches, that will tell me how many 10-mile segments there are.\n\nSo, 20 inches divided by (1/4 inch) equals how many? Let me calculate that. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So 20 \u00f7 (1/4) = 20 * 4 = 80. So, there are 80 segments of 1/4 inch in 20 inches.\n\nEach of these 80 segments is 10 miles. So, the total distance would be 80 multiplied by 10 miles. 80 * 10 is 800 miles. So, the actual distance is 800 miles.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me double-check the calculation. 1/4 inch = 10 miles. So, 1 inch would be (10 miles) divided by (1/4) which is 40 miles. Because 10 divided by 0.25 is 40. So, 1 inch equals 40 miles. Therefore, 20 inches would be 20 * 40 = 800 miles. Oh, same answer. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as setting up a proportion. The scale is 1/4 inch : 10 miles. The actual measured distance is 20 inches. Let me set up the ratio.\n\nSo, (1/4 inch) / (10 miles) = (20 inches) / (x miles). I can solve for x.\n\nCross-multiplying, (1/4) * x = 10 * 20. So, x/4 = 200. Multiply both sides by 4: x = 800. Yep, that gives the same result. So, I'm confident it's 800 miles.\n\nLooking at the options, A is 800. So the answer should be A.\n",
