I remember that simple interest is calculated using the formula I = PRT, where I is the interest, P is principal, R is rate, and T is time.\n\nWait, so Rahul borrowed Rs. 500. The rate is 6% per annum, and the time is 4 years. Let me plug these numbers into the formula. \n\nP is 500, R is 6%, which is 0.06 as a decimal, right? And T is 4. So I = 500 * 0.06 * 4.

Hmm, I remember simple interest is calculated using a specific formula.

Oh, and then the total amount to pay back is the principal plus the interest, so A = P + I.\n\nLet me break this down. The principal P is Rs. 500. The rate R is 6%, which I should convert into a decimal. So 6% is 0.06. Time T is 4 years. So putting those into the formula: I = 500 * 0.06 *4.\n\nCalculating that, 500 multiplied by 0.06 is 30.

Did I convert the percentage correctly? 6% is 0.06, yes. And the time is 4 years, so that's correct. Multiplying 500 by 0.06 gives 30, and times 4 is 120. So the interest is right. Adding that to 500 gives 620, which is option C. So I think that's correct. I don't think I missed anything here.\n\n\nTo determine the total amount Rahul will pay to clear the debt, we use the formula for simple interest:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Interest (I)} = P \\times R \\times T\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( P = 500 \\) (principal amount),\n- \\( R = 6\\% = 0.06 \\) (annual interest rate),\n- \\( T = 4 \\) years (time).\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\nI = 500 \\times 0.06 \\times 4 = 120\n\\]\n\nThe total amount to be paid back is the sum of the principal and the interest:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Amount} = P + I = 500 + 120 = 620\n\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about simple interest. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the question is, Rahul borrowed Rs. 500 at 6% per annum simple interest. He needs to pay back after 4 years. I need to find out the total amount he'll pay, which includes the principal and the interest.\n\nHmm, right, simple interest. I remember that simple interest is calculated using the formula: I = P * R * T. Where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest per annum, and T is the time in years.\n\nSo, let's plug in the numbers. The principal P is 500 rupees. The rate R is 6%, which is 0.06 in decimal. And the time T is 4 years. \n\nCalculating the interest: I = 500 * 0.06 * 4. Let me do that math. 500 times 0.06 is 30. Then, 30 multiplied by 4 is 120. So the interest is Rs. 120.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. 6% of 500 is 30 per year. So over four years, that's 30 *4 = 120. Yep, that seems right.\n\nNow, the total amount Rahul has to pay is the principal plus the interest. So that's 500 + 120 = 620. So the amount is 620 rupees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 620. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but wait a second. I remember that sometimes simple interest is calculated differently, but no, I think the formula is straightforward. Principal plus interest each year, but simple interest doesn't compound, right? So yeah, 6% simple on 500 for four years is correct as 120. So 500 + 120 is 620.\n\nLet me check the options again. Option C is 620. So the correct answer is C.\n",
