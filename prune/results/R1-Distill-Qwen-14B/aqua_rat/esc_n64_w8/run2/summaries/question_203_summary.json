      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where a father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan. Mohan is 23 and Sohan is 24 right now. The division is such that if their shares are invested at 4% compound interest, they'll get equal amounts when they turn 26. I need to find out Mohan's share.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. So, both sons are going to receive an amount now, invest it, and when they're 26, the amount they get will be the same. Since they're investing now, the time each amount will be invested for depends on their current ages.\n\nMohan is 23 now, so he'll be 26 in 3 years. Sohan is 24 now, so he'll be 26 in 2 years. So the money each gets will be invested for different periods. But the future value when they turn 26 should be equal.\n\nI remember that compound interest can be calculated using the formula: A = P(1 + r/100)^t, where A is the amount after t years, P is the principal, r is the rate, and t is the time.\n\nLet me denote Mohan's share as P and Sohan's share as Q. So P + Q = 5100.\n\nSince their future amounts must be equal when they turn 26, I can set up the equation:\n\nP*(1 + 4/100)^3 = Q*(1 + 4/100)^2\n\nBecause Mohan's money will compound for 3 years, and Sohan's for 2 years.\n\nLet me compute the interest factors. 4% is 0.04 in decimal.\n\nSo, (1.04)^3 for Mohan and (1.04)^2 for Sohan.\n\nCalculating (1.04)^2: 1.04 * 1.04 = 1.0816.\n\nCalculating (1.04)^3: 1.04 * 1.0816 = approximately 1.124864.\n\nWait, maybe I should be precise here. Let me compute it step by step.\n\n1.04 squared: 1.04 * 1.04 = (1 + 0.04)^2 = 1 + 2*0.04 + 0.04^2 = 1 + 0.08 + 0.0016 = 1.0816.\n\nThen, 1.04 cubed is 1.04 * 1.0816. Let me calculate that:\n\n1.0816 * 1.04:\n\n1.0816 * 1 = 1.0816.\n\n1.0816 * 0.04 = 0.043264.\n\nAdding together: 1.0816 + 0.043264 = 1.124864.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nP * 1.124864 = Q * 1.0816\n\nWe also know that P + Q = 5100.\n\nLet me express P in terms of Q or vice versa. Maybe solve for P from the first equation and substitute into the second.\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\nP = (Q * 1.0816) / 1.124864\n\nSimplify that fraction.\n\nLet me compute 1.0816 / 1.124864.\n\nDividing 1.0816 by 1.124864.\n\nHmm, let me see. 1.124864 divided by 1.0816 is approximately 1.0399. Wait, but I need 1.0816 / 1.124864.\n\nWait, 1.0816 / 1.124864 is approximately 0.9615 (since 1.124864 * 0.9615 \u2248 1.0816).\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to compute it.\n\n1.0816 / 1.124864 \u2248 ?\n\nLet me compute 1.0816 \u00f7 1.124864.\n\nUsing approximate division: 1.124864 \u00d7 0.96 = let's see:\n\n1.124864 * 0.96 = (1.124864 * 0.9) + (1.124864 * 0.06)\n\n0.9 * 1.124864 = 1.0123776\n\n0.06 * 1.124864 = 0.06749184\n\nAdding them: 1.0123776 + 0.06749184 \u2248 1.07986944\n\nWhich is close to 1.0816. The difference is 1.0816 - 1.07986944 = 0.00173056.\n\nSo perhaps 0.96 + (0.00173056 / 1.124864) as a small addition.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to approximate that the ratio is about 0.9615.\n\nWait, but maybe I can compute it more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute this as (1.0816)/(1.124864) = [ (1.0816) ] / [ (1.124864) ]\n\nAlternatively, perhaps cross-multiplied:\n\nLet me think about the equation again. So,\n\nP = Q * (1.0816) / (1.124864)\n\nSo, P/Q = (1.0816)/(1.124864) \u2248 0.9615.\n\nSo, P is approximately 0.9615 times Q.\n\nBut since P + Q = 5100,\n\nP = 5100 - Q.\n\nSo,\n\n5100 - Q = 0.9615 * Q\n\nAdding Q to both sides:\n\n5100 = 1.9615 * Q\n\nSo,\n\nQ = 5100 / 1.9615 \u2248 ?\n\nLet me compute 5100 / 1.9615.\n\nWait, 1.9615 is approximately 2 - 0.0385.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute 5100 divided by 1.9615.\n\nHmm, perhaps 1.9615 \u00d7 2600 = ?\n\nWait, 1.9615 \u00d7 2600 = ?\n\n2600 * 2 = 5200. 2600 * 0.9615 = ?\n\nWait, 2600 * 0.96 = 2496, and 2600 * 0.0015=3.9. So 2496 +3.9=2499.9.\n\nSo, 1.9615 \u00d72600 = 2600*(2 - 0.0385) = 5200 - (2600 * 0.0385)\n\nWait, 2600 * 0.0385: 2600 *0.03=78, 2600 *0.0085=22.1. So total 78 +22.1=100.1.\n\nSo 5200 -100.1 =5099.9, which is approximately 5100.\n\nSo, 1.9615 \u00d7 2600 \u2248 5100.\n\nSo, Q\u22482600, and P=5100 -2600=2500.\n\nWait, but wait. Because 1.9615 *2600 \u22485100.\n\nSo, Q\u22482600.\n\nSo, Sohan's share is 2600, and Mohan's is 2500.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nWait, if Sohan gets 2600, then in 2 years, it becomes 2600*(1.04)^2.\n\nWhich is 2600 * 1.0816 = 2600 *1.0816.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n2600 * 1.0816 = ?\n\nWell, 2600 *1 = 2600.\n\n2600 *0.08 = 208.\n\n2600 *0.0016=4.16.\n\nAdding: 2600 +208=2808 +4.16=2812.16.\n\nSimilarly, Mohan's share is 2500, invested for 3 years.\n\n2500 * (1.04)^3 = 2500 *1.124864.\n\n2500 *1.124864 = ?\n\n2500 *1 =2500.\n\n2500 *0.124864 = 2500 *0.12 =300, 2500 *0.004864=12.16.\n\nSo, 300 +12.16=312.16.\n\nSo, 2500 +312.16=2812.16.\n\nYes, both amounts are equal.\n\nSo, Sohan gets 2600, Mohan gets 2500. So the question is asking for Mohan's share, which is 2500.\n\nLooking at the options: option B is 2500.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where a father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan, who are currently 23 and 24 years old respectively. The goal is to divide the amount such that when their shares are invested at a compound interest rate of 4% per annum, both will receive equal amounts when they reach the age of 26. I need to find out how much Mohan gets.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. Both sons are going to reach 26, so I should figure out how many years each has until then. Mohan is 23 now, so he has 3 years until 26. Sohan is 24, so he has 2 years until 26. The money they receive now will be invested at 4% compound interest, and after those respective periods, their amounts should be equal.\n\nLet me denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's share as S. The total amount is 5100, so M + S = 5100. That's equation one.\n\nNow, the key part is the compound interest. For compound interest, the formula is A = P*(1 + r)^t, where A is the amount after time t, P is the principal, r is the rate, and t is time in years.\n\nSince the amounts need to be equal when they turn 26, I can set up an equation where the amount Mohan gets after 3 years equals the amount Sohan gets after 2 years.\n\nSo, M*(1 + 0.04)^3 = S*(1 + 0.04)^2.\n\nLet me compute the (1.04) raised to those powers. Alternatively, I can keep them as exponents for now.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express S in terms of M using the first equation. Since S = 5100 - M, I can substitute that into the second equation.\n\nSo substituting S, we get:\n\nM*(1.04)^3 = (5100 - M)*(1.04)^2\n\nLet me compute the numerical values for (1.04)^3 and (1.04)^2.\n\nCalculating (1.04)^2: 1.04 * 1.04 = 1.0816.\n\nCalculating (1.04)^3: 1.04 * 1.0816 = let's see, 1.04 * 1.08 is 1.1232, and 1.04 * 0.0016 is 0.001664, so adding together gives 1.124864. Wait, maybe I should just calculate it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor it out. Let me write the equation again.\n\nM*(1.04)^3 = (5100 - M)*(1.04)^2.\n\nDivide both sides by (1.04)^2 to simplify:\n\nM*(1.04) = (5100 - M).\n\nSo, M * 1.04 = 5100 - M.\n\nNow, let's bring all M terms to one side.\n\nM*1.04 + M = 5100.\n\nFactor M:\n\nM*(1.04 + 1) = 5100.\n\nWait, 1.04 + 1 is 2.04. So M * 2.04 = 5100.\n\nSo, M = 5100 / 2.04.\n\nLet me compute that. 5100 divided by 2.04.\n\nHmm, 2.04 * 2500 is 5100 because 2.04 * 2500 = (2 *2500) + (0.04 *2500) = 5000 + 100 = 5100. So M is 2500.\n\nWait, that would mean M is 2500. Then S would be 5100 - 2500 = 2600.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, I thought when I set up the equation after substituting S, I got M*(1.04)^3 = (5100 - M)*(1.04)^2.\n\nThen, dividing both sides by (1.04)^2 gives M*(1.04) = 5100 - M.\n\nSo, 1.04M + M = 5100.\n\nWhich is 2.04 M = 5100.\n\nSo M = 5100 / 2.04.\n\nWait, 5100 divided by 2.04. Let's compute that.\n\nWhat is 2.04 * 2500?\n\n2.04 * 2500: 2 *2500 is 5000, 0.04*2500 is 100. So total is 5100. So yes, 2500 is correct.\n\nSo M is 2500, S is 5100 -2500=2600.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for Mohan's share, which is 2500. Looking at the options, option B is 2500.\n\nWait, but let me think again. So the way I set it up, M is Mohan's present amount. When he invests it for 3 years, the amount is M*(1.04)^3. Sohan's present amount is S=5100-M, which is invested for 2 years, giving S*(1.04)^2. These are set to be equal.\n\nSo, M*(1.04)^3 = (5100 - M)*(1.04)^2.\n\nDividing both sides by (1.04)^2:\n\nM*1.04 = 5100 - M.\n\nSo, 1.04 M + M = 5100.\n\n2.04 M =5100.\n\nM=5100/2.04=2500.\n\nYes, that makes sense.

The goal is to split the money such that when each son's share is invested at a 4% compound interest rate, they'll end up with equal amounts when they turn 26. I need to find out how much Mohan gets.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. Both sons are going to be 26 eventually. So for Mohan, that's 3 years from now, and Sohan is just 2 years away from 26. Wait, no. Wait, actually, no. Wait, if Mohan is 23 now, in 3 years he'll be 26. Sohan is 24 now, so in 2 years he'll be 26. So the time each amount is invested for is different.\n\nSo the father is dividing the 5100 into two parts: one for Mohan and one for Sohan. Let's call Mohan's share 'M' and Sohan's share 'S'. So M + S = 5100.\n\nThe key here is that after their respective investment periods, both amounts should be equal. So the amount that Mohan's share grows to after 3 years at 4% CI should equal the amount Sohan's share grows to after 2 years at the same rate.\n\nCompound interest formula is A = P*(1 + r)^t, where A is the amount, P is principal, r is rate, and t is time.\n\nSo for Mohan: A_m = M * (1 + 0.04)^3\n\nFor Sohan: A_s = S * (1 + 0.04)^2\n\nAnd since A_m equals A_s, we can set them equal:\n\nM*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2\n\nHmm, let's compute the values of these exponents.\n\n1.04^2 is 1.0816, and 1.04^3 is 1.124864.\n\nWait, so substituting those in:\n\nM * 1.124864 = S * 1.0816\n\nBut since M + S = 5100, maybe we can express S in terms of M. Let's see.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation: M / S = (1.0816) / (1.124864)\n\nLet me compute that ratio. Let's calculate 1.0816 / 1.124864.\n\nDividing 1.0816 by 1.124864... Hmm, let me do that division.\n\nWait, 1.0816 divided by 1.124864. Let me approximate:\n\n1.124864 is approximately 1.1249. So 1.0816 / 1.1249 \u2248 0.9615. Hmm, let me check with a calculator. Alternatively, perhaps I can find an exact value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can cross-multiply to find the ratio.\n\nWait, M * (1.04)^3 = S * (1.04)^2\n\nDivide both sides by (1.04)^2: M * 1.04 = S\n\nSo M * 1.04 = S\n\nSo S = 1.04 * M\n\nNow, since M + S = 5100, substituting S:\n\nM + 1.04 M = 5100\n\nSo 2.04 M = 5100\n\nTherefore, M = 5100 / 2.04\n\nLet me compute that. 5100 divided by 2.04.\n\nLet me see: 2.04 times 2500 is 5100, because 2 *2500=5000, 0.04*2500=100, so total 5100. So 2.04 * 2500 = 5100, so M = 2500.\n\nWait, wait, that's a possibility. So M is 2500, and S is 2600?\n\nWait, wait. Wait, wait, no. Because S = 1.04 * M, so if M is 2500, S is 2500 * 1.04 = 2600. Then M + S = 2500 + 2600 = 5100, which matches.\n\nSo that would make Mohan's share 2500, which is option B.\n\nBut let me double-check the calculations to make sure.\n\nSo, M = 2500. After 3 years, at 4% CI: 2500 * (1.04)^3.\n\nWe calculated 1.04^3 as 1.124864.\n\nSo 2500 * 1.124864 = ?\n\n2500 * 1.124864: Let's compute that.\n\n2500 * 1.124864 = 2500 * (1 + 0.12 + 0.004864) = 2500 + 2500*0.12 + 2500 * 0.004864\n\n2500 + 300 + 12.16 = 2812.16.\n\nWait, 2500 * 1.124864:\n\nWait, 2500 * 1.124864 = 2500 * (1.12 + 0.004864) = 2500 * 1.12 is 2800, 2500 * 0.004864 is 12.16. So total 2800 +12.16 = 2812.16.\n\nNow, Sohan's share is 2600. He invests it for 2 years: 2600*(1.04)^2.\n\n1.04^2 is 1.0816.\n\n2600 * 1.0816 = ?\n\nCompute 2600 * 1.0816:\n\n2600 * 1 = 2600.\n\n2600 * 0.08 = 208.\n\n2600 * 0.0016 = 4.16.\n\nSo 2600 + 208 = 2808; 2808 + 4.16 = 2812.16.\n\nYes, so both amounts are 2812.16 when they are 26.

He invests it for 2 years: 2600*(1.04)^2.\n\n1.04^2 is 1.0816.\n\n2600 * 1.0816 = ?\n\nCompute 2600 * 1.0816:\n\n2600 * 1 = 2600.\n\n2600 * 0.08 = 208.\n\n2600 * 0.0016 = 4.16.\n\nSo 2600 + 208 = 2808; 2808 + 4.16 = 2812.16.\n\nYes, so both amounts are 2812.16 when they are 26. So that checks out.\n\nSo the correct answer is 2500, which is option B.\n\n\nThe father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan (23 years old) and Sohan (24 years old), such that their shares, when invested at 4% compound interest, yield equal amounts when they turn 26. Let Mohan's share be \\( M \\) and Sohan's share be \\( S \\). The total amount is \\( M + S = 5100 \\).\n\nThe compound interest formula is \\( A = P \\cdot (1 + r)^t \\), where \\( A \\) is the final amount, \\( P \\) is the principal, \\( r \\) is the interest rate, and \\( t \\) is the time in years. For Mohan, the amount after 3 years is \\( M \\cdot (1.04)^3 \\), and for Sohan, the amount after 2 years is \\( S \\cdot (1.04)^2 \\). Since these amounts are equal:\n\n\\[\nM \\cdot (1.04)^3 = S \\cdot (1.04)^2\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\( (1.04)^2 \\), we get:\n\n\\[\nM \\cdot 1.04 = S\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( S = 1.04M \\) into the total amount equation \\( M + S = 5100 \\):\n\n\\[\nM + 1.04M = 5100\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2.04M = 5100\n\\]\n\n\\[\nM = \\frac{5100}{2.04} = 2500\n\\]\n\nThus, Mohan's share is \\( 2500 \\). Verifying, Mohan's amount after 3 years is:\n\n\\[\n2500 \\cdot (1.04)^3 = 2500 \\cdot 1.124864 = 2812.16\n\\]\n\nSohan's share is \\( S = 1.04M = 2600 \\), and after 2 years:\n\n\\[\n2600 \\cdot (1.04)^2 = 2600 \\cdot 1.0816 = 2812.16\n\\]\n\nBoth amounts are equal, confirming the solution. Therefore, Mohan's share is \\( 2500 \\).\n\nAnswer: B",

The division is such that if their shares are invested at a compound interest rate of 4% per annum, they'll receive equal amounts when they turn 26. I need to find out Mohan's share.\n\nHmm, let me think. So both sons are getting some amount now, which they'll invest. Then, when they're 26, the amount each has grown will be equal. Let me figure out how much time each investment has.\n\nMohan is 23 now, so he'll be 26 in 3 years. Sohan is 24, so he'll be 26 in 2 years. That makes sense.\n\nThe compound interest formula is A = P*(1 + r)^t, where A is the amount, P the principal, r the rate, and t the time in years. So for both, their investment should grow to the same amount when they are 26.\n\nLet's denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's share as S. So, M + S = 5100, since the total is 5100.\n\nNow, the future values should be equal. So, for Mohan: his amount after 3 years is M*(1 + 0.04)^3. For Sohan: his amount after 2 years is S*(1 + 0.04)^2. These two should be equal.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\nM*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2\n\nWait, since M + S = 5100, maybe I can express S as 5100 - M and substitute.\n\nLet me write that equation again. Let's compute the factors first.\n\n1.04^3 is... Let me calculate. 1.04 * 1.04 = 1.0816, then times 1.04 again. So 1.0816 * 1.04. Let's see, 1.0816 *1.04. Let me compute that:\n\n1.0816 *1.04: 1.0816 * 1 is 1.0816, 1.0816 *0.04 is 0.043264. Adding together gives 1.124864.

So adding:\n\n5100 +408 =5508, plus 8.16 is 5516.16.\n\nSo numerator is 5516.16.\n\nDenominator is 2.206464.\n\nSo M = 5516.16 / 2.206464.\n\nLet me compute that. Let me approximate.\n\nFirst, let's see what 2.206464 times 2500 is. 2500 *2.206464= 5,516.16.\n\nWait a minute! That's exactly the numerator. So 2500 * 2.206464 = 5516.16.\n\nSo M = 5516.16 / 2.206464 = 2500.\n\nWait, so M is 2500. So the answer should be B) 2500.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations.

I need to find out how much Mohan gets.\n\nHmm, let me think. So, the key here is that their shares will grow at 4% compound interest and become equal when they're 26. So, I should figure out how much each son's share will be worth in two years and three years respectively, because Mohan is 23 now and Sohan is 24.\n\nWait, wait. Let's get the time right. When they turn 26, that's three years from now for Mohan (since 26-23=3) and two years for Sohan (26-24=2). Oh wait, no, Sohan is 24, so 26 is two years away. So, Mohan's money is invested for 3 years, and Sohan's for 2 years.\n\nThe idea is that the amount each gets when they turn 26 should be equal. So, if Mohan's share is 'x', it'll be invested for 3 years, and Sohan's share is '5100 - x', invested for 2 years.

So when I divide, I'm left with 1.04 on the left.\n\nSo, 1.04x = 5100 - x\n\nNow, bring x terms to one side. 1.04x + x = 5100\n\nThat's 2.04x = 5100\n\nSo, x = 5100 / 2.04\n\nLet me compute that. Let's see, 5100 divided by 2.04.\n\nHmm, maybe I can simplify this. Let's see, 2.04 is 204/100. So, 5100 * (100/204) = ?\n\nWait, 5100 divided by 2.04 is the same as 5100 multiplied by (1/2.04). Alternatively, maybe I can compute it step by step.\n\nLet me compute 5100 \u00f7 2.04.\n\nWell, 2.04 times 2500 is 5100 because 2.04 * 2500 = 2500 * 2 + 2500 * 0.04 = 5000 + 100 = 5100.\n\nOh! So x would be 2500. Because 2.04 * 2500 = 5100.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 2.04 * 2500 is 5100, so x = 2500.\n\nSo, x is 2500, which is Mohan's share.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculation.\n\nLet me compute 2.04 multiplied by 2500:\n\n2.04 * 2500 = 2 * 2500 + 0.04 * 2500 = 5000 + 100 = 5100. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, x is 2500, so Mohan's share is 2500. So the answer should be option B) 2500.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in setting up the equation.\n\nThe problem says that when they reach 26, the amounts are equal. So, Mohan's investment is for 3 years, Sohan's for 2 years.\n\nSo, the setup was correct: x*(1.04)^3 = (5100 -x)*(1.04)^2.\n\nDivide both sides by (1.04)^2: x*(1.04) = 5100 - x.\n\nYes, that's correct. Then, 1.04x + x = 5100 \u2192 2.04x =5100 \u2192 x=2500.\n\nSo, yeah, the answer should be B)2500.\n",

Let's see, 5100 divided by 2.04.\n\nHmm, maybe I can simplify this. Let's see, 2.04 is 204/100. So, 5100 * (100/204) = ?\n\nWait, 5100 divided by 2.04 is the same as 5100 multiplied by (1/2.04). Alternatively, maybe I can compute it step by step.\n\nLet me compute 5100 \u00f7 2.04.\n\nWell, 2.04 times 2500 is 5100 because 2.04 * 2500 = 2500 * 2 + 2500 * 0.04 = 5000 + 100 = 5100.\n\nOh! So x would be 2500. Because 2.04 * 2500 = 5100.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 2.04 * 2500 is 5100, so x = 2500.\n\nSo, x is 2500, which is Mohan's share.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculation.\n\nLet me compute 2.04 multiplied by 2500:\n\n2.04 * 2500 = 2 * 2500 + 0.04 * 2500 = 5000 + 100 = 5100. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, x is 2500, so Mohan's share is 2500. So the answer should be option B) 2500.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in setting up the equation.\n\nThe problem says that when they reach 26, the amounts are equal. So, Mohan's investment is for 3 years, Sohan's for 2 years.\n\nSo, the setup was correct: x*(1.04)^3 = (5100 -x)*(1.04)^2.\n\nDivide both sides by (1.04)^2: x*(1.04) = 5100 - x.\n\nYes, that's correct. Then, 1.04x + x = 5100 \u2192 2.04x =5100 \u2192 x=2500.\n\nSo, yeah, the answer should be B)2500.\n\n\nThe father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan, such that their shares, when invested at 4% compound interest, yield equal amounts when they turn 26. Mohan is currently 23, so his share will be invested for 3 years, while Sohan, who is 24, will have his share invested for 2 years. Let Mohan's share be \\( x \\), and Sohan's share will then be \\( 5100 - x \\).\n\nUsing the compound interest formula \\( A = P \\times (1 + r)^t \\), the future values of their shares must be equal:\n\n\\[\nx \\times (1 + 0.04)^3 = (5100 - x) \\times (1 + 0.04)^2\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\( (1 + 0.04)^2 \\) simplifies the equation to:\n\n\\[\nx \\times (1.04) = 5100 - x\n\\]\n\nRearranging terms:\n\n\\[\n1.04x + x = 5100 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2.04x = 5100\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{5100}{2.04} = 2500\n\\]\n\nThus, Mohan's share is Rs. 2500. The correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: B**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where a father is dividing Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan. Mohan is 23 and Sohan is 24 now. The father wants to split the money such that when each son's share is invested at 4% compound interest, they'll have equal amounts when they turn 26. I need to find out how much Mohan gets.\n\nHmm, let me think. So both sons are getting some money now, and each will invest theirs. After a few years, their investments will grow, and the amounts should be equal when they're 26.\n\nWait, how old are they now? Mohan is 23, Sohan 24. They'll reach 26 in 3 years and 2 years respectively. Because 26 minus 23 is 3, and 26 minus 24 is 2. So the time each has for the investment is different.\n\nThe compound interest formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), but since the interest is annual and I think it's compounded yearly, n would be 1. So the formula simplifies to A = P*(1 + r)^t.\n\nThe problem says their future amounts (when they are 26) should be equal. So, the amount from Mohan's share after 3 years should equal the amount from Sohan's share after 2 years.\n\nLet me denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's as S. So, M + S = 5100.\n\nAfter 3 years, Mohan's amount is M*(1.04)^3, and after 2 years, Sohan's is S*(1.04)^2. These two should be equal.\n\nSo, the equation is M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2.\n\nI can rewrite this as M/S = (1.04)^2 / (1.04)^3 \u2192 M/S = 1/(1.04). Because when you divide exponents with the same base, you subtract them. So 3-2=1, but wait, actually (1.04)^3 divided by (1.04)^2 is (1.04)^1. Oh wait, wait, wait. Let me think again.\n\nThe equation is M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2 \u2192 M = S*(1.04)^2 / (1.04)^3 \u2192 M = S/(1.04). So M/S = 1/(1.04). Alternatively, M = S / 1.04.\n\nWait, no, maybe I should rearrange it. Let's see:\n\nM*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2 \u2192 divide both sides by (1.04)^2 \u2192 M*(1.04) = S \u2192 M = S / 1.04.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me double-check the math. So, if I have M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2, then dividing both sides by (1.04)^2 gives M*(1.04) = S. Oh, wait, that's correct. So S = M * 1.04. So Sohan's share is 1.04 times Mohan's share.\n\nWait, but since M + S = 5100, and S = 1.04*M, then M + 1.04*M = 5100 \u2192 2.04*M = 5100 \u2192 M = 5100 / 2.04.\n\nLet me compute that. 5100 divided by 2.04. Hmm, 2.04 times 2500 is 5100, because 2.04 * 2500 = (2 * 2500) + (0.04 * 2500) = 5000 + 100 = 5100. Oh, that's neat. So M would be 2500, and S would be 2600.\n\nWait, wait, because S is 1.04 times M. So if M is 2500, S is 2500 *1.04 = 2600. So the total is 2500 +2600 =5100, which matches.\n\nSo Mohan's share is 2500. Looking at the options, option B is 2500.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me check the future amounts. For Mohan: 2500*(1.04)^3. For Sohan: 2600*(1.04)^2.\n\nCompute (1.04)^3: 1.04 *1.04 = 1.0816, then *1.04 \u2192 1.124864.\n\nSo 2500 * 1.124864 = 2812.16.\n\nFor Sohan: (1.04)^2 is 1.0816. 2600 * 1.0816 = let's see, 2600 *1.08 is 2808, and 2600 *0.0016 is 4.16, so total 2812.16. Yes, they are equal. So the answer is 2500, which is option B.\n",

Their ages are 23 and 24 now, and they're going to receive their shares in such a way that when their shares are invested at a 4% compound interest rate, they'll get equal amounts when they turn 26. I need to find out how much Mohan gets.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. Both sons will receive their shares now, and then those amounts will grow with compound interest until they're 26. At that point, the amounts they get should be equal.\n\nWait, wait. Let's think about the time each son's money will be invested. So, Mohan is 23 now, so he has 3 more years until he's 26. Sohan is 24 now, so he has 2 years until he's 26. That means each son's investment will compound for different periods.\n\nThe key here is that the future value of each son's share at age 26 should be equal. Because the interest rate is the same, the present value (the share each son gets) should be such that when compounded for their respective periods, they end up equal.\n\nLet me denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's share as S. Since the total is 5100, M + S = 5100.\n\nThe future value for Mohan's share after 3 years at 4% would be M * (1 + 0.04)^3. Similarly, Sohan's future value after 2 years is S * (1 + 0.04)^2. Since these future values are equal, I can set up the equation:\n\nM * (1.04)^3 = S * (1.04)^2\n\nHmm, I can simplify this equation. Let's write it out:\n\nM * (1.04)^3 = S * (1.04)^2\n\nDivide both sides by (1.04)^2 to get M*(1.04) = S.\n\nSo, S = M * 1.04.\n\nBut since M + S = 5100, I can substitute S with 1.04*M.\n\nSo, M + 1.04*M = 5100.\n\nThat's 2.04*M = 5100.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me double-check that. M + 1.04*M is 2.04*M. So,\n\n2.04*M = 5100.\n\nTo find M, divide 5100 by 2.04. Let's compute that.\n\nHmm, 5100 divided by 2.04. Let's see, 2.04 times 2500 is 5100, because 2.04 * 2500 = 5100. Oh wait, 2.04 * 2500 is 5100 because 2500*2 is 5000 and 2500*0.04 is 100, so 5000+100=5100. So M would be 2500?\n\nWait, but wait. If M is 2500, then S would be 2500 * 1.04 = 2600. So 2500 + 2600 = 5100. That adds up correctly.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's plug these back into the future value equation.\n\nMohan's future value: 2500*(1.04)^3.\n\nSohan's future value: 2600*(1.04)^2.\n\nLet me compute both.\n\nFirst, (1.04)^2 is 1.0816. So 2600*1.0816 = 2600 *1.0816. Let's compute that.\n\n2600 * 1 is 2600. 2600 * 0.08 is 208. 2600 * 0.0016 is 4.16. So 2600 + 208 = 2808, plus 4.16 is 2812.16.\n\nNow for Mohan's part: 2500*(1.04)^3. Let's compute (1.04)^3. (1.04)^2 is 1.0816, multiply by 1.04 again: 1.0816 *1.04. Let's see: 1.0816 * 1 is 1.0816, 1.0816 *0.04 is 0.043264. So adding, 1.0816 + 0.043264 = 1.124864.\n\nSo 2500 * 1.124864 = 2500 * approx 1.124864. Let's calculate that.\n\n2500 * 1 is 2500. 2500 *0.12 is 300. 2500 *0.004864 is 12.16. So 2500 +300=2800, plus 12.16 is 2812.16.\n\nYes, both future values are 2812.16, so that checks out.\n\nSo according to this, Mohan's share is 2500. Looking at the options, option B is 2500.\n\nWait, but wait. The options include option E, which is none of these. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me recheck the math when I set up the equation.\n\nThe future values are equal, so:\n\nM*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2.\n\nDivide both sides by (1.04)^2:\n\nM*(1.04) = S.\n\nSo S = M*1.04.\n\nTotal is M + S = M + 1.04M = 2.04M =5100.\n\nSo M =5100 /2.04.\n\nLet me compute that again.\n\n2.04 times 2500 is 5100 because 2500*2 is 5000, 2500*0.04 is 100. So yes, 2.04*2500=5100.\n\nSo M is 2500, which is option B.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the time correct? Mohan is 23 now, so in 3 years, he'll be 26. So his money compounds for 3 years. Sohan is 24, so in 2 years he'll be 26, so his money compounds for 2 years. So the setup is correct.\n\nSo I think the answer is option B)2500.\n",

Because the interest rate is the same, the present value (the share each son gets) should be such that when compounded for their respective periods, they end up equal.\n\nLet me denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's share as S. Since the total is 5100, M + S = 5100.\n\nThe future value for Mohan's share after 3 years at 4% would be M * (1 + 0.04)^3. Similarly, Sohan's future value after 2 years is S * (1 + 0.04)^2. Since these future values are equal, I can set up the equation:\n\nM * (1.04)^3 = S * (1.04)^2\n\nHmm, I can simplify this equation. Let's write it out:\n\nM * (1.04)^3 = S * (1.04)^2\n\nDivide both sides by (1.04)^2 to get M*(1.04) = S.\n\nSo, S = M * 1.04.\n\nBut since M + S = 5100, I can substitute S with 1.04*M.\n\nSo, M + 1.04*M = 5100.\n\nThat's 2.04*M = 5100.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me double-check that. M + 1.04*M is 2.04*M. So,\n\n2.04*M = 5100.\n\nTo find M, divide 5100 by 2.04. Let's compute that.\n\nHmm, 5100 divided by 2.04. Let's see, 2.04 times 2500 is 5100, because 2.04 * 2500 = 5100. Oh wait, 2.04 * 2500 is 5100 because 2500*2 is 5000 and 2500*0.04 is 100, so 5000+100=5100. So M would be 2500?\n\nWait, but wait. If M is 2500, then S would be 2500 * 1.04 = 2600. So 2500 + 2600 = 5100. That adds up correctly.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's plug these back into the future value equation.\n\nMohan's future value: 2500*(1.04)^3.\n\nSohan's future value: 2600*(1.04)^2.\n\nLet me compute both.\n\nFirst, (1.04)^2 is 1.0816. So 2600*1.0816 = 2600 *1.0816. Let's compute that.\n\n2600 * 1 is 2600. 2600 * 0.08 is 208. 2600 * 0.0016 is 4.16. So 2600 + 208 = 2808, plus 4.16 is 2812.16.\n\nNow for Mohan's part: 2500*(1.04)^3. Let's compute (1.04)^3. (1.04)^2 is 1.0816, multiply by 1.04 again: 1.0816 *1.04. Let's see: 1.0816 * 1 is 1.0816, 1.0816 *0.04 is 0.043264. So adding, 1.0816 + 0.043264 = 1.124864.\n\nSo 2500 * 1.124864 = 2500 * approx 1.124864. Let's calculate that.\n\n2500 * 1 is 2500. 2500 *0.12 is 300. 2500 *0.004864 is 12.16. So 2500 +300=2800, plus 12.16 is 2812.16.\n\nYes, both future values are 2812.16, so that checks out.\n\nSo according to this, Mohan's share is 2500. Looking at the options, option B is 2500.\n\nWait, but wait. The options include option E, which is none of these. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me recheck the math when I set up the equation.\n\nThe future values are equal, so:\n\nM*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2.\n\nDivide both sides by (1.04)^2:\n\nM*(1.04) = S.\n\nSo S = M*1.04.\n\nTotal is M + S = M + 1.04M = 2.04M =5100.\n\nSo M =5100 /2.04.\n\nLet me compute that again.\n\n2.04 times 2500 is 5100 because 2500*2 is 5000, 2500*0.04 is 100. So yes, 2.04*2500=5100.\n\nSo M is 2500, which is option B.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the time correct? Mohan is 23 now, so in 3 years, he'll be 26. So his money compounds for 3 years. Sohan is 24, so in 2 years he'll be 26, so his money compounds for 2 years. So the setup is correct.\n\nSo I think the answer is option B)2500.\n\n\nThe father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan (23 years old) and Sohan (24 years old), such that their shares, when invested at 4% compound interest, yield equal amounts when they turn 26. \n\nLet Mohan's share be \\( M \\) and Sohan's share be \\( S \\). The total amount is \\( M + S = 5100 \\). Since the future values of their shares must be equal at age 26, we set up the equation:\n\n\\[\nM \\cdot (1.04)^3 = S \\cdot (1.04)^2\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\( (1.04)^2 \\), we get:\n\n\\[\nM \\cdot 1.04 = S \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad S = M \\cdot 1.04\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( S = 1.04M \\) into \\( M + S = 5100 \\), we have:\n\n\\[\nM + 1.04M = 5100 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2.04M = 5100\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( M \\):\n\n\\[\nM = \\frac{5100}{2.04} = 2500\n\\]\n\nThus, Mohan's share is Rs. 2500. Verifying, Sohan's share is \\( S = 2500 \\cdot 1.04 = 2600 \\), and the total is \\( 2500 + 2600 = 5100 \\), which matches the given total. Additionally, the future values of both shares at age 26 are equal, confirming the solution.\n\nThe correct answer is **B) 2500**.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where a father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan. Mohan is 23 and Sohan is 24 years old. The division is such that when their shares are invested at a compound interest rate of 4% per annum, they'll receive equal amounts when they both turn 26. I need to find out what Mohan's share is.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. Both sons will get a certain amount, and then their investments grow at 4% compound interest. After three years (since Mohan is 23 and Sohan is 24, and they'll be 26 in 3 and 2 years respectively), their investments should be equal.\n\nWait, but wait, when they turn 26, that's in 3 years for Mohan (23 +3 =26) and 2 years for Sohan (24+2=26). So the money each receives will be invested for different periods. So their future values should be equal.\n\nLet me think about the formula for compound interest. The future value is P*(1 + r)^t, where P is principal, r is rate, t is time. So for both, the future value should be the same.\n\nLet me denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's share as S. So, M + S = 5100, that's the first equation.\n\nNow, for their future amounts to be equal: M*(1 + 0.04)^3 = S*(1 + 0.04)^2. Because Mohan's money grows for 3 years, and Sohan's for 2 years.\n\nLet me write that equation out. So, M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2.\n\nI can rearrange this to find a ratio between M and S. Let's divide both sides by (1.04)^2. That gives M*(1.04) = S.\n\nSo, M = S / 1.04.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let's see:\n\nM*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2\n\nDivide both sides by (1.04)^2: M*(1.04) = S.\n\nSo S = M * 1.04.\n\nWait, that makes sense because Sohan's investment period is shorter, so his principal needs to be a bit larger to get the same future amount as Mohan's, which is invested for longer.\n\nSo now, I have two equations:\n\n1. M + S = 5100\n2. S = 1.04 * M\n\nSubstituting equation 2 into equation 1:\n\nM + 1.04 M = 5100\nThat's 2.04 M = 5100.\n\nSo M = 5100 / 2.04.\n\nLet me calculate that. Hmm, 5100 divided by 2.04.\n\nWait, 2.04 times 2500 is 5100, because 2 * 2500 is 5000, and 0.04*2500 is 100. So 5000+100=5100.\n\nOh, so M is 2500. Then S would be 1.04 * 2500 = 2600.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So 2500 plus 2600 is 5100, which is correct.\n\nSo Mohan's share is 2500, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure about the time periods. So, for Mohan, it's 3 years, and Sohan, 2 years. So the future values must be the same.\n\nLet me compute the future values.\n\nMohan: 2500*(1.04)^3.\n\nLet me compute (1.04)^3. 1.04 * 1.04 is 1.0816, times 1.04 again: 1.0816 * 1.04. Let me calculate that.\n\n1.0816 * 1.04:\n\n1 * 1.04 = 1.04\n0.08 *1.04=0.0832\n0.0016*1.04=0.001664\nAdding these: 1.04 + 0.0832 = 1.1232 + 0.001664 = 1.124864.\n\nSo 2500 * 1.124864 = 2500 * approx 1.124864.\n\n2500 *1.12 is 2800, and 0.004864*2500 is about 12.16. So total is 2812.16.\n\nSohan's share is 2600, invested for 2 years: 2600*(1.04)^2.\n\n(1.04)^2 is 1.0816.\n\n2600 *1.0816 = ?\n\n2600 *1.08 is 2808, and 0.0016*2600=4.16. So total is 2808 +4.16= 2812.16.\n\nYes, that matches. So both future values are equal, which checks out.\n\nSo the correct answer is 2500, which is option B.\n",
