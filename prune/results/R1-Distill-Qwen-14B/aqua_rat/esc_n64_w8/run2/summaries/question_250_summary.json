Hmm, I remember that the capacity of a tank would be its volume, right? So I need to calculate the volume of this tank.\n\nWait, how do I calculate the volume of a rectangular tank again? Oh yeah, it's length multiplied by width multiplied by height. So the formula is V = l \u00d7 w \u00d7 h. Got it.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. The length is 8 meters, width is 6 meters, and height is 2.5 meters. So 8 * 6 is 48, and then 48 * 2.5. Let me do that step by step. 48 times 2 is 96, and 48 times 0.5 is 24, so adding them gives 120. So the volume is 120 cubic meters.\n\nBut wait, the options are in liters, not cubic meters. Oh right, I need to convert cubic meters to liters. I remember that 1 cubic meter is equal to 1000 liters. So 120 cubic meters would be 120 multiplied by 1000, which is 120,000 liters. \n\nLooking at the options, option D is 120,000 liters. That seems right.

So D is the correct answer.\n\nWait a second, but sometimes people get confused between cubic meters and liters. Let me make sure. 1 m\u00b3 is indeed 1000 liters. So 120 m\u00b3 is 120,000 liters.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about the capacity of a tank, and I need to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step.\n\nThe question gives the dimensions of the tank as 8 meters by 6 meters by 2.5 meters. Hmm, I remember that the capacity or volume of a tank is usually calculated by multiplying its length, width, and height. So the formula should be Volume = length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height.\n\nWait, right, the units here are all in meters. So when I multiply them, the volume will be in cubic meters. But the options are given in liters. Oh right, I need to convert cubic meters to liters because the answer choices are in liters.\n\nI think 1 cubic meter is equal to 1000 liters. Yeah, because 1 m\u00b3 is 10^3 liters, or 1000 liters. So if I calculate the volume in cubic meters and then multiply by 1000, I'll get liters.\n\nLet me do the math. The length is 8 m, width 6 m, height 2.5 m. So 8 * 6 is 48, and 48 * 2.5 is... let's see. 48 times 2 is 96, and 48 times 0.5 is 24. So 96 +24 is 120. So the volume is 120 cubic meters.\n\nWait, wait, no, wait a second. 8 *6 is 48, yes. 48 *2.5 is 120? Wait, 2.5 times 48. Let me calculate that again. 48 * 2 is 96, 48 *0.5 is 24. 96 +24 is 120. So yes, 120 m\u00b3.\n\nSo converting that to liters: 120 m\u00b3 * 1000 liters/m\u00b3 = 120,000 liters. Oh, but wait, looking at the options, option D is 120000 liters.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this question about the capacity of a tank, and I need to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step.\n\nThe question gives the dimensions of the tank as 8 meters by 6 meters by 2.5 meters. Hmm, I remember that the capacity or volume of a tank is usually calculated by multiplying its length, width, and height. So the formula should be Volume = length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height.\n\nWait, right, the units here are all in meters. So when I multiply them, the volume will be in cubic meters. But the options are given in liters. Oh right, I need to convert cubic meters to liters because the answer choices are in liters.\n\nI think 1 cubic meter is equal to 1000 liters. Yeah, because 1 m\u00b3 is 10^3 liters, or 1000 liters. So if I calculate the volume in cubic meters and then multiply by 1000, I'll get liters.\n\nLet me do the math. The length is 8 m, width 6 m, height 2.5 m. So 8 * 6 is 48, and 48 * 2.5 is... let's see. 48 times 2 is 96, and 48 times 0.5 is 24. So 96 +24 is 120. So the volume is 120 cubic meters.\n\nWait, wait, no, wait a second. 8 *6 is 48, yes. 48 *2.5 is 120? Wait, 2.5 times 48. Let me calculate that again. 48 * 2 is 96, 48 *0.5 is 24. 96 +24 is 120. So yes, 120 m\u00b3.\n\nSo converting that to liters: 120 m\u00b3 * 1000 liters/m\u00b3 = 120,000 liters. Oh, but wait, looking at the options, option D is 120000 liters.
