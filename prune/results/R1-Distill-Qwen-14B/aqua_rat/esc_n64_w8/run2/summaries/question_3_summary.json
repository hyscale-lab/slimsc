      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let's see, I need to find which of the options is a multiple of X, given that X is divisible by both 9 and 12. Hmm, wait, no, the question says the value is a multiple of X, and X is divisible by 9 and 12. Wait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question is: Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12? Oh wait, perhaps I got it wrong. Maybe the question is, find which value is a multiple of X, where X is such that X is divisible by 9 and 12. Or maybe the question is phrased as the value being a multiple of X, and that value is divisible by 9 and 12. Hmm, the wording is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, let me parse it again. The question says: \"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\" Oh, perhaps it's saying that the value is a multiple of X, and the value is divisible by 9 and 12. So the value must be a multiple of X, and also, that same value must be divisible by both 9 and 12. So we're looking for a value that is a multiple of X, and that value is a common multiple of 9 and 12.\n\nWait, but what is X in this context? I think I might have misread it. Oh, maybe X is a number that is divisible by 9 and 12. So X is a common multiple of 9 and 12, and the options are possible values of X. But the question is phrased as which option is a multiple of X. Wait, no, the options are the values, and each is a possible multiple of X. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking: which of the following values is a multiple of X, and X itself is divisible by 9 and 12. So, X must be a common multiple of 9 and 12. So first, I need to find what X is, or perhaps find the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12. Because if X is divisible by both 9 and 12, then X must be a multiple of their LCM.\n\nSo let's compute the LCM of 9 and 12. The prime factors of 9 are 3\u00b2, and 12 is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3. The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes present, so that would be 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3\u00b2 = 4 \u00d79=36. So the LCM is 36. So X must be a multiple of 36. So X could be 36, 72, 108, etc.\n\nNow, the options given are A)36, B)15, C)17, D)5, E)7. So the question is asking which of these options is a multiple of X. But wait, X is a multiple of 36. So the options must be multiples of X. Or, wait, perhaps the options are the possible values of X, and the question is which of them is a multiple of X, which is divisible by 9 and 12. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased as: which of the following values is a multiple of X, given that X is divisible by 9 and 12. So X is any number that's a multiple of both 9 and 12, which as we found is 36, 72, etc. Then, the options are possible multiples of X.\n\nBut the options are 36,15,17,5,7. So if X is 36, then the options are possible multiples of X. For example, 36 is a multiple of X=36 (since 36\u00d71=36). But 15 is 36\u00d7something? No, because 15 is less than 36. So 15 can't be a multiple of 36. Similarly, 17, 5, 7 are all less than 36, so none of them except 36 itself would be a multiple of X=36. So the only possible option that can be a multiple of X is 36, if X is 36.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as, the value is a multiple of X, and X is divisible by 9 and 12. So the value must be a multiple of X, which is a multiple of 36. So the value must be a multiple of 36, because X is at least 36, and the value is a multiple of X.\n\nLooking at the options, only 36 is a multiple of 36. Because 15,17,5,7 are all less than 36, so they can't be multiples of 36. So the correct answer is A)36.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is saying that the value is a multiple of X, and the value is divisible by 9 and 12. So the value must be a multiple of the LCM of 9 and 12, which is 36. So the value must be a multiple of 36. So among the options, which is a multiple of 36? Only 36 is, as 36 \u00d71 =36. The other options are 15,17,5,7, none of which are multiples of 36.\n\nSo the correct answer is A)36.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here, and I need to figure out which of the options is a multiple of X, given that X is divisible by both 9 and 12. Hmm, wait, let me read the question again carefully. \n\nThe question says, \"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\" Oh wait, maybe I got that mixed up.

But the question is about which option is a multiple of X. Or wait, maybe the other way around. Let me think.\n\nWait, the exact wording is: \"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\" Oh, wait, maybe the subject is a bit different. Let me clarify. It's asking for a value among the options that is a multiple of X, and that value (the option) is itself divisible by 9 and 12. Or wait, no, maybe X is the number that is divisible by 9 and 12, and we need to find which option is a multiple of X.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach it methodically. Let's break down the problem.\n\nThe problem states: X is a number that is divisible by both 9 and 12. So X must be a common multiple of 9 and 12. Since 9 and 12 have a least common multiple (LCM), which is the smallest number that is a multiple of both, and then X could be any multiple of that LCM. But the question is asking which of the options is a multiple of X.\n\nWait, but the options are specific numbers. So, perhaps we're looking for an option that is a multiple of X. But since X is a multiple of both 9 and 12, perhaps the options have to be a multiple of X, which itself is a multiple of 9 and 12. Wait, that might not make sense because the options are smaller numbers, like 36,15,17,5,7. So perhaps I'm getting the question wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is phrased as: find the value among the options which is a multiple of X, and X is divisible by 9 and 12. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the value is a multiple of X, and that value is divisible by both 9 and 12. Or perhaps X is a multiple of the value, and X is divisible by 9 and 12. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify the problem structure.\n\nWait, the exact question is: \"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\" So, perhaps the value (the option) is a multiple of X, and that value is also divisible by 9 and 12. So, the option must be a multiple of X, which is itself a number divisible by 9 and 12.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Maybe the question is: X is a number that is divisible by both 9 and 12. So, X must be a common multiple of 9 and 12. Therefore, X must be at least the LCM of 9 and 12. Let me calculate that.\n\nThe LCM of 9 and 12: 9 factors into 3^2, 12 factors into 2^2 *3^1. The LCM takes the highest exponents, so 2^2 *3^2 = 4*9=36. So the LCM is 36. So X could be 36, 72, 108, etc. But since the options are much smaller, perhaps X is 36, and the question is which of the options is a multiple of 36.\n\nWait, but the options are 36,15,17,5,7. So 36 is in the options as option A. So if X is 36, then which option is a multiple of X? Only 36 is a multiple of itself, so option A is correct.\n\nBut wait, is that the right approach? Let me think again. The question is phrased as: which of the options is a multiple of X, where X is a number that is divisible by 9 and 12. So X can be any multiple of 36. So, for example, X could be 36, 72, 108, etc. Now, the options are 36, 15,17,5,7. So if X is 36, the only option that is a multiple of X is 36 (since 36*1=36). If X were 72, then none of the options would be a multiple of X because 72 is larger than all options except possibly 36, but 36 is less than 72. So 36 is a multiple of 72 only if 36 is divisible by 72, which it's not.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is the other way around. Maybe X is a number that is a multiple of the given options, and X is also divisible by 9 and 12. So, the question is which option is such that X is a multiple of it, and X is also divisible by 9 and 12.\n\nWait, that would make more sense. Because then the question would be, which of the options divides X, which is a number divisible by 9 and 12. So, which option is a divisor of X, which is a multiple of 36 (since 36 is the LCM of 9 and 12).\n\nSo, if X is a multiple of 36, which of the options is a divisor of X. So, X could be 36, 72, 108, etc.\n\nLooking at the options: 36,15,17,5,7.\n\nWhich of these numbers divides 36? 36 divides itself, 15 doesn't (36/15=2.4), 17 is bigger than 36, so no, 5 and 7 are smaller but 36 isn't divisible by them. So if X is 36, then the only option that is a divisor of X is 36 (option A).\n\nBut wait, if X is 72, which is a multiple of 36, then 36 divides 72, but 15 doesn't (72/15=4.8), 17 is larger than 72, so no, 5 and 7 also don't. So again, the only option that is a divisor of X is 36. So in that case, option A would be correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The question says, \"which of the following values is the multiple of X\", meaning X is a factor of the value. So the value is a multiple of X. So the options are possible values, and X is a factor of that value. But X is itself divisible by 9 and 12, so X is a multiple of 36.\n\nSo, the value (option) must be a multiple of X, which is a multiple of 36. So the value must be a multiple of 36. So the value would be 36, 72, 108, etc.\n\nLooking at the options, only option A is 36, which is a multiple of X (since X is 36 in that case). The other options are 15,17,5,7, which are all smaller than 36 and can't be multiples of X, which is at least 36.\n\nWait, but if X is 36, then the options that are multiples of X would have to be 36, 72, etc. So the only option that is a multiple of X is 36 itself. So the answer would be A)36.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question says: Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\n\nWait, maybe the structure is: the value is a multiple of X, and the value is divisible by 9 and 12. So, the value must be a multiple of X, which is itself a multiple of 9 and 12.\n\nWait, but that would mean the value is a multiple of X, which is a multiple of 36, so the value must be a multiple of 36. So which option is a multiple of 36? Only option A)36, because 36*1=36. The other options are smaller than 36, so they can't be multiples of X (which is at least 36).\n\nSo yes, the correct answer is A)36.\n",

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes present. So that would be 2^2 * 3^2, which is 4 * 9 = 36. So the LCM of 9 and 12 is 36. That means X must be a multiple of 36. So X = 36, 72, 108, etc.\n\nWait, but the question is about which of the options is a multiple of X. Wait, that doesn't make sense because X is a multiple of 36. So the options are the numbers, and we have to see which is a multiple of X, which is a multiple of 36. But that would mean that the option is a multiple of a larger number, which is X.

Well, X is a multiple of 36, like 36, 72, 108, etc. So 36 is a multiple of 36, yes. But if X is 72, is 36 a multiple of 72? No, because 36 is less than 72. So 36 can only be a multiple of X if X is 36. But X could be any multiple of 36. So the only way option A is a multiple of X is if X is 36. But since X could be any multiple of 36, like 72, then 36 isn't a multiple of 72. So option A is only correct if X is exactly 36.\n\nWait, but the question says \"if it is divisible by 9 and 12,\" meaning X is divisible by both. So X can be any number that is a multiple of 36.

Perhaps the question is, the value (the options) is a multiple of X, and X is divisible by 9 and 12. So X must be a multiple of 36, and the options are numbers that are multiples of X. But looking at the options, the numbers are 36, 15, etc.\n\nWait, but if X is a multiple of 36, then the options can only be a multiple of X if they are a multiple of 36. Because X is at least 36.\n\nLooking at the options, only option A is 36. So if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X (36 is 36*1). But if X is 72, then 36 isn't a multiple of 72. So the only way this works is if X is 36. So the only option that can be a multiple of X (which is 36) is option A.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I misread the question. The question says, \"which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\" So the 'it' here refers to X. So X is divisible by 9 and 12. So X is a multiple of 36. Then, the options are the possible values, and the question is which of these is a multiple of X. So, which option is a multiple of X, where X is a multiple of 36.\n\nSo for each option, we have to check if X divides that option. So:\n\nOption A:36. So 36 divided by X is an integer only if X is 36 or a divisor of 36. But since X is a multiple of 36, the only possible X is 36. Because if X is 72, 36/72 is 0.5, not integer. So 36 is a multiple of X only if X is 36.\n\nOption B:15. 15 divided by X. X is at least 36. 15 is smaller than X, so 15/X is less than 1, so no.\n\nOption C:17. Same as above, 17 <36, so no.\n\nOption D:5. Same, no.\n\nOption E:7. Same, no.\n\nSo the only possible option is A)36, which is a multiple of X if X is 36.

So option A is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if X is 72, none of the options would be multiples of X because the options are all smaller than 72 except none. Wait, no, the options are 36, 15, 17, 5,7. So if X is 72, the only option that could be a multiple is 36, but 36 is not a multiple of 72. So the only possibility is that X is 36, making 36 a multiple of X.

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes present. So that would be 2^2 * 3^2, which is 4 * 9 = 36. So the LCM of 9 and 12 is 36. That means X must be a multiple of 36. So X = 36, 72, 108, etc.\n\nWait, but the question is about which of the options is a multiple of X. Wait, that doesn't make sense because X is a multiple of 36. So the options are the numbers, and we have to see which is a multiple of X, which is a multiple of 36. But that would mean that the option is a multiple of a larger number, which is X. But looking at the options, the numbers are 36, 15, 17, 5, 7. So if X is 36, then which of these options is a multiple of 36?\n\nLet me check each option:\n\nOption A: 36. Is 36 a multiple of X? Well, X is 36 or a multiple of 36. So 36 is a multiple of X only if X is 36. Because if X is 72, 36 is not a multiple of 72. So 36 can only be a multiple of X if X is 36 itself.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased a bit confusingly. Let me read again: \"which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\" Oh wait, maybe I got it wrong. Let me rephrase: X is a number that is divisible by both 9 and 12. So X must be a multiple of 36. Then, the question is which of the options is a multiple of X.\n\nSo the options are the possible multiples of X. So for each option, we need to check if X divides it. So for each option, option is a multiple of X.\n\nWait, but X is a multiple of 36. So the options are 36, 15, 17, 5, 7.\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA) 36: So is 36 a multiple of X? Well, X is a multiple of 36, like 36, 72, 108, etc. So 36 is a multiple of 36, yes. But if X is 72, is 36 a multiple of 72? No, because 36 is less than 72. So 36 can only be a multiple of X if X is 36. But X could be any multiple of 36. So the only way option A is a multiple of X is if X is 36. But since X could be any multiple of 36, like 72, then 36 isn't a multiple of 72. So option A is only correct if X is exactly 36.\n\nWait, but the question says \"if it is divisible by 9 and 12,\" meaning X is divisible by both. So X can be any number that is a multiple of 36. But the options are the numbers, and we have to find which is a multiple of X.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this the wrong way. Perhaps the question is, the value (the options) is a multiple of X, and X is divisible by 9 and 12. So X must be a multiple of 36, and the options are numbers that are multiples of X. But looking at the options, the numbers are 36, 15, etc.\n\nWait, but if X is a multiple of 36, then the options can only be a multiple of X if they are a multiple of 36. Because X is at least 36.\n\nLooking at the options, only option A is 36. So if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X (36 is 36*1). But if X is 72, then 36 isn't a multiple of 72. So the only way this works is if X is 36. So the only option that can be a multiple of X (which is 36) is option A.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I misread the question. The question says, \"which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\" So the 'it' here refers to X. So X is divisible by 9 and 12. So X is a multiple of 36. Then, the options are the possible values, and the question is which of these is a multiple of X. So, which option is a multiple of X, where X is a multiple of 36.\n\nSo for each option, we have to check if X divides that option. So:\n\nOption A:36. So 36 divided by X is an integer only if X is 36 or a divisor of 36. But since X is a multiple of 36, the only possible X is 36. Because if X is 72, 36/72 is 0.5, not integer. So 36 is a multiple of X only if X is 36.\n\nOption B:15. 15 divided by X. X is at least 36. 15 is smaller than X, so 15/X is less than 1, so no.\n\nOption C:17. Same as above, 17 <36, so no.\n\nOption D:5. Same, no.\n\nOption E:7. Same, no.\n\nSo the only possible option is A)36, which is a multiple of X if X is 36. So the answer is A.\n\nWait, but the options are the values that are multiples of X. So if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of 36. So option A is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if X is 72, none of the options would be multiples of X because the options are all smaller than 72 except none. Wait, no, the options are 36, 15, 17, 5,7. So if X is 72, the only option that could be a multiple is 36, but 36 is not a multiple of 72. So the only possibility is that X is 36, making 36 a multiple of X. So option A is the correct answer.\n\n\nTo determine which of the given options is a multiple of \\( X \\), we first analyze the condition that \\( X \\) is divisible by both 9 and 12. This means \\( X \\) must be a multiple of the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12. \n\nThe prime factorization of 9 is \\( 3^2 \\), and the prime factorization of 12 is \\( 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\). The LCM is obtained by taking the highest powers of all prime factors present, which gives \\( 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 = 4 \\cdot 9 = 36 \\). Therefore, \\( X \\) must be a multiple of 36, such as 36, 72, 108, etc.\n\nThe question asks which of the options is a multiple of \\( X \\). For each option, we check if it can be a multiple of \\( X \\), given that \\( X \\) is a multiple of 36:\n\n- **Option A: 36**  \n  If \\( X = 36 \\), then 36 is a multiple of \\( X \\) (since \\( 36 \\div 36 = 1 \\)). However, if \\( X \\) is a larger multiple of 36 (e.g., 72), 36 is not a multiple of \\( X \\). Thus, 36 can only be a multiple of \\( X \\) if \\( X = 36 \\).\n\n- **Option B: 15**  \n  15 is smaller than 36, so it cannot be a multiple of \\( X \\), which is at least 36.\n\n- **Option C: 17**  \n  Similarly, 17 is smaller than 36 and cannot be a multiple of \\( X \\).\n\n- **Option D: 5**  \n  5 is smaller than 36 and cannot be a multiple of \\( X \\).\n\n- **Option E: 7**  \n  7 is smaller than 36 and cannot be a multiple of \\( X \\).\n\nThe only option that satisfies the condition is **36**, which is a multiple of \\( X \\) if \\( X = 36 \\). Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: A**",

The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both. So to find LCM(9,12), I can factor each into primes. 9 is 3\u00b2, and 12 is 2\u00b2 * 3\u00b9. So the LCM would take the highest power of each prime present. So that's 2\u00b2 and 3\u00b2, which is 4*9=36. So LCM(9,12)=36.\n\nSo X is 36, because X is the LCM.

Let me think.\n\nWait, I think the problem is that X is a number that is divisible by 9 and 12. So X must be a common multiple of 9 and 12. The least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12 would be the smallest number that both 9 and 12 divide into.

But wait, the question is phrased as \"X is divisible by 9 and 12.\" So X is a number that is a multiple of 36.

So we're looking for an option that is a multiple of X, which is a multiple of 36. But wait, that doesn't make sense because if X is 36, then a multiple of X would be 72, 108, etc. But the options are 36,15,17,5,7. So 36 is an option. So is 36 a multiple of X?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting the question wrong. Let me read it again. The question says, \"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\" So X is a number that is divisible by both 9 and 12. So X must be a common multiple of 9 and 12, which is at least 36. So the options are possible values for X. Or wait, no, the options are possible values that are multiples of X. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased as: \"Find which of the following values is a multiple of X, if X is divisible by 9 and 12.\" So X is a number divisible by both 9 and 12, and we need to find which of the options (A to E) is a multiple of X. So X is a common multiple of 9 and 12. Let's think about that.\n\nIf X is a multiple of 9 and 12, then X must be a multiple of their LCM, which is 36. So X could be 36, 72, 108, etc. Now, the options are A)36, B)15, C)17, D)5, E)7. So each option is a number. The question is which of these is a multiple of X. Wait, but X is a multiple of 36. So let's think: For each option, can X divide it? Because a multiple of X would be X multiplied by some integer.\n\nWait, but if X is 36, then a multiple of X would be 36*1=36, 36*2=72, etc. So 36 is a multiple of X (since X is 36). But 15 is not a multiple of 36, because 36 is larger than 15. Same with 17, 5, 7\u2014they are all less than 36, so none of them can be multiples of 36 except 36 itself. So in the options, 36 is option A. So if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X. So A is a possible answer.\n\nWait, but what if X is a larger number, like 72? Then, 72 is a multiple of 36. So X is 72, which is a multiple of 36. Now, which of the options is a multiple of 72? Let's see: 36 is less than 72, so 72 can't be a multiple of 36 in that sense. Wait, no, wait\u2014no, 36 is a factor of 72, so 72 is a multiple of 36. But the options are the possible values that are multiples of X (72). So, 36 is less than 72, so 36 can't be a multiple of 72. So none of the options (15,17,5,7,36) are multiples of 72 except perhaps none. But wait, 36 is less than 72, so 72 can't be a divisor of 36. So if X is 72, then the options don't have any multiple of X. So that would mean that only if X is 36, then option A is a multiple of X.\n\nBut wait, the question is phrased as \"if X is divisible by 9 and 12, which of the following is a multiple of X?\" So the options are the possible multiples of X. So in that case, if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X (since 36 *1=36). But if X is 72, then 36 is not a multiple of 72. So the only way one of the options can be a multiple of X is if X is 36. Because if X is 36, then option A (36) is a multiple of X (since 36 *1=36). But any higher multiple of 36 (like 72) would not have any of the options as their multiples.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. X is a number that is divisible by 9 and 12. So X could be 36, 72, 108, etc. We are to find which of the options is a multiple of X. So the options are numbers, and we need to see if any of them is a multiple of X. But since X is at least 36, the only option that could be a multiple of X is 36 itself, but only if X is 36. Because if X is 72, then 36 is a factor of 72, but 72 doesn't divide into 36. So 36 can't be a multiple of 72. So the only way an option can be a multiple of X is if X is 36, and the option is 36.\n\nSo among the options, 36 is the only possible multiple of X, but only if X is exactly 36. Because if X were larger than 36, like 72, then none of the options are multiples of X. So the correct answer must be 36, option A.\n\nWait, but let me check. Suppose X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X (since 36 = 36 *1). So option A is correct. But what if X is, say, 108? Then none of the options (36, 15, etc.) would be multiples of 108.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is asking which of the given options is a multiple of X, given that X is divisible by both 9 and 12. Hmm, wait, no, actually, let me read it again. Oh right, it's phrased as \"if it is divisible by 9 and 12.\" So I think that the value X must be a number that's divisible by both 9 and 12. Then, we're supposed to find which of the options is a multiple of X. Or wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question says, \"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\" Oh, wait, perhaps X is a number that is divisible by both 9 and 12, and then among the options, which one is a multiple of X. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps X is a number that is a multiple of 9 and 12. Hmm. Let me think.\n\nWait, I think the problem is that X is a number that is divisible by 9 and 12. So X must be a common multiple of 9 and 12. The least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12 would be the smallest number that both 9 and 12 divide into. So let me calculate that. \n\nThe prime factors of 9 are 3\u00b2, and of 12 are 2\u00b2 * 3\u00b9. So the LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes involved. So that would be 2\u00b2 * 3\u00b2 = 4 * 9 = 36. So the LCM of 9 and 12 is 36. So any multiple of 36 will be divisible by both 9 and 12. But wait, the question is phrased as \"X is divisible by 9 and 12.\" So X is a number that is a multiple of 36. So X could be 36, 72, 108, etc.\n\nNow, the options given are A)36, B)15, C)17, D)5, E)7. The question is asking which of these values is a multiple of X. Wait, that's a bit confusing. So the options are the possible values, and we need to see which one is a multiple of X, where X is a number that is itself divisible by 9 and 12. So X must be a multiple of 36. So we're looking for an option that is a multiple of X, which is a multiple of 36. But wait, that doesn't make sense because if X is 36, then a multiple of X would be 72, 108, etc. But the options are 36,15,17,5,7. So 36 is an option. So is 36 a multiple of X?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting the question wrong. Let me read it again. The question says, \"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\" So X is a number that is divisible by both 9 and 12. So X must be a common multiple of 9 and 12, which is at least 36. So the options are possible values for X. Or wait, no, the options are possible values that are multiples of X. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased as: \"Find which of the following values is a multiple of X, if X is divisible by 9 and 12.\" So X is a number divisible by both 9 and 12, and we need to find which of the options (A to E) is a multiple of X. So X is a common multiple of 9 and 12. Let's think about that.\n\nIf X is a multiple of 9 and 12, then X must be a multiple of their LCM, which is 36. So X could be 36, 72, 108, etc. Now, the options are A)36, B)15, C)17, D)5, E)7. So each option is a number. The question is which of these is a multiple of X. Wait, but X is a multiple of 36. So let's think: For each option, can X divide it? Because a multiple of X would be X multiplied by some integer.\n\nWait, but if X is 36, then a multiple of X would be 36*1=36, 36*2=72, etc. So 36 is a multiple of X (since X is 36). But 15 is not a multiple of 36, because 36 is larger than 15. Same with 17, 5, 7\u2014they are all less than 36, so none of them can be multiples of 36 except 36 itself. So in the options, 36 is option A. So if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X. So A is a possible answer.\n\nWait, but what if X is a larger number, like 72? Then, 72 is a multiple of 36. So X is 72, which is a multiple of 36. Now, which of the options is a multiple of 72? Let's see: 36 is less than 72, so 72 can't be a multiple of 36 in that sense. Wait, no, wait\u2014no, 36 is a factor of 72, so 72 is a multiple of 36. But the options are the possible values that are multiples of X (72). So, 36 is less than 72, so 36 can't be a multiple of 72. So none of the options (15,17,5,7,36) are multiples of 72 except perhaps none. But wait, 36 is less than 72, so 72 can't be a divisor of 36. So if X is 72, then the options don't have any multiple of X. So that would mean that only if X is 36, then option A is a multiple of X.\n\nBut wait, the question is phrased as \"if X is divisible by 9 and 12, which of the following is a multiple of X?\" So the options are the possible multiples of X. So in that case, if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X (since 36 *1=36). But if X is 72, then 36 is not a multiple of 72. So the only way one of the options can be a multiple of X is if X is 36. Because if X is 36, then option A (36) is a multiple of X (since 36 *1=36). But any higher multiple of 36 (like 72) would not have any of the options as their multiples.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. X is a number that is divisible by 9 and 12. So X could be 36, 72, 108, etc. We are to find which of the options is a multiple of X. So the options are numbers, and we need to see if any of them is a multiple of X. But since X is at least 36, the only option that could be a multiple of X is 36 itself, but only if X is 36. Because if X is 72, then 36 is a factor of 72, but 72 doesn't divide into 36. So 36 can't be a multiple of 72. So the only way an option can be a multiple of X is if X is 36, and the option is 36.\n\nSo among the options, 36 is the only possible multiple of X, but only if X is exactly 36. Because if X were larger than 36, like 72, then none of the options are multiples of X. So the correct answer must be 36, option A.\n\nWait, but let me check. Suppose X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X (since 36 = 36 *1). So option A is correct. But what if X is, say, 108? Then none of the options (36, 15, etc.) would be multiples of 108. So the only option that works is when X is 36, and the option is 36. So the answer must be A)36.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine which of the given options is a multiple of \\( X \\), where \\( X \\) is a number divisible by both 9 and 12. \n\n### Step 1: Understanding the requirements for \\( X \\)\nIf \\( X \\) is divisible by both 9 and 12, it must be a common multiple of these two numbers. The smallest such number is the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12. \n\n- Prime factors of 9: \\( 3^2 \\)\n- Prime factors of 12: \\( 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\)\n\nThe LCM is obtained by taking the highest powers of all prime factors:\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(9, 12) = 2^2 \\times 3^2 = 4 \\times 9 = 36\n\\]\nThus, \\( X \\) must be a multiple of 36, such as 36, 72, 108, etc.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the options\nThe options provided are:\n- A) 36\n- B) 15\n- C) 17\n- D) 5\n- E) 7\n\nWe need to determine which of these is a multiple of \\( X \\), where \\( X \\) is a multiple of 36. \n\n- If \\( X = 36 \\), then 36 is a multiple of \\( X \\) (since \\( 36 = 36 \\times 1 \\)).\n- If \\( X = 72 \\), none of the options (36, 15, 17, 5, 7) are multiples of 72.\n- Similarly, for larger multiples of 36 (e.g., 108), none of the options would be multiples of \\( X \\).\n\nThus, the only option that satisfies the condition is 36, which is a multiple of \\( X \\) when \\( X = 36 \\).\n\n### Final Answer\nThe correct answer is **A) 36**.\n\nAnswer: A",

So I need to find which of these is a multiple of X. But wait, X is a multiple of both 9 and 12, which means X is a common multiple. So the smallest X would be the LCM of 9 and 12, but X could be any multiple of that LCM. So let me calculate the LCM of 9 and 12 first.\n\nTo find the LCM of 9 and 12, I can break them down into their prime factors. 9 is 3 squared (3^2), and 12 is 2 squared times 3 (2^2 *3). The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes present. So for 2, the highest power is 2^2, and for 3, it's 3^2. So LCM is 4 *9 = 36. Oh, so X must be a multiple of 36. So X could be 36, 72, 108, etc.\n\nNow the options are numbers like 36,15,17,5,7. The question is asking which of these is a multiple of X. Wait, wait, no, the wording is a bit tricky. Wait, the question is phrased as \"which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\" Hmm, maybe I misread it. Let me parse that again.\n\nOh, wait, maybe the question is that the value is a multiple of X, and X is divisible by 9 and 12. So X is a multiple of both 9 and 12. So X is a common multiple. So the value in the options has to be a multiple of X. Wait, but if X is 36, then the option must be a multiple of 36. Looking at the options, only A is 36. So 36 is a multiple of X when X is 36? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X (since 36 *1=36). But wait, the options are the possible values. Wait, the question is phrased a bit confusingly.\n\nWait, the question says: Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12. So X is a number that's divisible by 9 and 12, meaning X is a multiple of their LCM, which is 36. So X must be 36, 72, etc. The options given are numbers. So which of the options is a multiple of X, which is 36. So the options must be a multiple of 36.\n\nLooking at the options: A is 36, which is 36 *1, so it's a multiple. B is 15, which isn't a multiple of 36. C is 17, no. D is 5, no. E is 7, no. So the only possible one is A)36.\n\nWait, but wait a second. If X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X. Because 36 = X *1. So yes, that's correct. So the correct answer is A)36.\n\n\nTo determine which of the given options is a multiple of \\( X \\), where \\( X \\) is divisible by both 9 and 12, we first find the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12. Breaking them into prime factors:\n\n- \\( 9 = 3^2 \\)\n- \\( 12 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\)\n\nThe LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors, so:\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(9, 12) = 2^2 \\times 3^2 = 4 \\times 9 = 36\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( X \\) must be a multiple of 36. The question asks which of the given options is a multiple of \\( X \\). Since \\( X \\) is a multiple of 36, the option must be a multiple of 36. Examining the options:\n\n- \\( A) 36 \\): This is exactly 36, which is a multiple of 36.\n- \\( B) 15 \\): 15 is not a multiple of 36.\n- \\( C) 17 \\): 17 is not a multiple of 36.\n- \\( D) 5 \\): 5 is not a multiple of 36.\n- \\( E) 7 \\): 7 is not a multiple of 36.\n\nThe only option that satisfies the condition is \\( A) 36 \\).\n\nAnswer: A",
