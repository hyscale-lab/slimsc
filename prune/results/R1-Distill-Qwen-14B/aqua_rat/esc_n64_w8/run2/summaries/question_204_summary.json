      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see, the question is asking what is 60% of 30% of 1400 grams. Hmm, percentages can be a bit tricky, but I think I can handle this by breaking it down.\n\nAlright, first, I should probably find out what 30% of 1400 grams is. Because once I have that number, I can then find 60% of that result. So, step by step.\n\nWait, percentages are parts per hundred, right? So 30% is the same as 30 per 100, which is 0.3 in decimal form. So, to find 30% of 1400 grams, I can multiply 1400 by 0.3.\n\nLet me write that out: 1400 * 0.3. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 1400 times 0.3. Well, 1400 times 0.1 is 140, so 0.3 is three times that. 140 *3 is 420. So, 30% of 1400 grams is 420 grams. Got that part.\n\nNow, the next step is to find 60% of that 420 grams. So, again, I'll convert 60% to a decimal, which is 0.6. Multiply 420 by 0.6.\n\nLet me compute that: 420 * 0.6. Well, 400 *0.6 is 240, and 20*0.6 is 12. So, 240 +12 is 252. So, 60% of 420 grams is 252 grams.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 1400 *0.3 is indeed 420. Then, 420 *0.6: 400 *0.6 is 240, 20 *0.6 is 12, so 252. Yep, that looks right.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 252 grams. So that should be the correct answer. Let me just make sure none of the other options match. Option A is 450, which is bigger than 1400, so that's way off. Option B is 100, which is way too low. D is 240, which is close but not the 252 I calculated. So, the right choice is C.\n",

It says, \"What is 60% of 30% of 1400 grams?\" Hmm, percentages can sometimes be a bit tricky, but I think I can break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, first, I remember that \"of\" in math usually means multiplication. So, 60% of something is the same as 60% multiplied by that something. But wait, here it's 60% of 30% of 1400 grams. So I guess I have to do it in two steps or maybe combine them somehow.\n\nLet me think. So, 30% of 1400 grams first. To find a percentage of a number, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply. So 30% is 0.3. So 0.3 multiplied by 1400 grams. Let me calculate that. 0.3 times 1400. Hmm, 0.3 times 1000 is 300, and 0.3 times 400 is 120. So 300 plus 120 is 420. So 30% of 1400 grams is 420 grams.\n\nWait, but that's just the first part. Now I need to find 60% of that 420 grams. So again, I'll convert 60% to a decimal, which is 0.6, and multiply it by 420. Let me do that. 0.6 times 420. Hmm, 0.6 times 400 is 240, and 0.6 times 20 is 12. So 240 plus 12 is 252. So 60% of 420 is 252 grams.\n\nWait, but another way to think about this is to combine the percentages. So 60% of 30% is the same as (60/100)*(30/100) = (60*30)/(100*100) = 1800/10000 = 0.18. So 0.18 times 1400 grams. Let me check that. 0.18 * 1400. Well, 0.1 times 1400 is 140, and 0.08 times 1400 is 112. So 140 + 112 is 252. Yep, same answer.

Let me calculate that. 0.3 times 1400 is... let's see, 1400 divided by 10 is 140, so 3 times 140 is 420. So 30% of 1400 is 420 grams.\n\nWait, but then I need 60% of that 420 grams. Oh right, so now I calculate 60% of 420. Again, percentage to decimal, so 0.6 times 420. Let me do that. 420 times 0.6 is the same as 420 multiplied by 6 and then divided by 10. 420 times 6 is 2520, divided by 10 gives 252. So 60% of 420 is 252 grams.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I did that right. Another way to think about it: 10% of 420 is 42, so 60% is 6 times that. 42 times 6 is 252. Yep, same answer.

Second step: 60% of 420. 0.6 * 420 = 252. Yep, that's right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can do it all in one go. So 60% of 30% is 0.6 * 0.3 = 0.18. Then multiply that by 1400. Let's see: 0.18 * 1400. 1400 times 0.1 is 140, and 1400 times 0.08 is 112. Adding them together: 140 + 112 = 252. Same result.

The question is asking, \"What is 60% of 30% of 1400 grams?\" And there are multiple-choice options provided. Hmm, percentages can sometimes be a bit tricky, but I think I can handle this.\n\nAlright, breaking it down. The problem involves two percentages applied successively to 1400 grams. First, 30% of 1400 grams, and then 60% of that result. So I need to calculate each step one after the other.\n\nLet me start with the first part: finding 30% of 1400 grams. I remember that \"of\" in math problems usually means multiplication. So 30% can be written as 0.3 in decimal form. So I multiply 1400 by 0.3. Let me do that calculation.\n\n1400 * 0.3. Hmm, 1400 times 0.3. Well, 100 times 0.3 is 30, so 1400 is 14 times 100. So 14 * 30 is 420. So 30% of 1400 grams is 420 grams. Okay, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, the next step is to find 60% of that 420 grams. Again, converting the percentage to decimal. 60% is 0.6. So I need to multiply 420 by 0.6. Let's see.\n\n420 * 0.6. Hmm, 400 * 0.6 is 240, and 20 * 0.6 is 12. So adding those together, 240 +12 is 252. So 60% of 420 grams is 252 grams.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Alternatively, 420 * 0.6. 420 times 0.6: 420 divided by 10 is 42, times 6 is 252. Yep, same result. So that seems correct.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is 252 grams. So that should be the correct answer. But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me re-express the entire calculation in another way.\n\nAnother approach: instead of calculating each percentage step by step, maybe I can combine the percentages first. So 60% of 30% is the same as 0.6 * 0.3, which is 0.18, or 18%. So 18% of 1400 grams.\n\nLet me calculate 18% of 1400. 1400 * 0.18. Hmm, 1400 * 0.1 is 140, and 1400 * 0.08 is 112. Adding those together, 140 + 112 is 252 grams. Yep, same result. So that's another way to see it.\n\nSo either way I approach it, the answer is 252 grams. Looking back at the options, C is 252 gms, so that must be the correct choice.\n\nWait, but let me glance over the other options to make sure I didn't misread any. Option A is 450, which is way higher than what I got. Option B is 100, which is too low. Option D is 240, which is close but not quite 252. So C is the right one.\n\nI think I've thought it through properly. No mistakes in the calculations that I can see. So I'm confident that the answer is C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is asking, \"What is 60% of 30% of 1400 grams?\" And there are multiple-choice options provided. Hmm, percentages can sometimes be a bit tricky, but I think I can handle this.\n\nAlright, breaking it down. The problem involves two percentages applied successively to 1400 grams. First, 30% of 1400 grams, and then 60% of that result. So I need to calculate each step one after the other.\n\nLet me start with the first part: finding 30% of 1400 grams. I remember that \"of\" in math problems usually means multiplication. So 30% can be written as 0.3 in decimal form. So I multiply 1400 by 0.3. Let me do that calculation.\n\n1400 * 0.3. Hmm, 1400 times 0.3. Well, 100 times 0.3 is 30, so 1400 is 14 times 100. So 14 * 30 is 420. So 30% of 1400 grams is 420 grams. Okay, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, the next step is to find 60% of that 420 grams. Again, converting the percentage to decimal. 60% is 0.6. So I need to multiply 420 by 0.6. Let's see.\n\n420 * 0.6. Hmm, 400 * 0.6 is 240, and 20 * 0.6 is 12. So adding those together, 240 +12 is 252. So 60% of 420 grams is 252 grams.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Alternatively, 420 * 0.6. 420 times 0.6: 420 divided by 10 is 42, times 6 is 252. Yep, same result. So that seems correct.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is 252 grams. So that should be the correct answer. But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me re-express the entire calculation in another way.\n\nAnother approach: instead of calculating each percentage step by step, maybe I can combine the percentages first. So 60% of 30% is the same as 0.6 * 0.3, which is 0.18, or 18%. So 18% of 1400 grams.\n\nLet me calculate 18% of 1400. 1400 * 0.18. Hmm, 1400 * 0.1 is 140, and 1400 * 0.08 is 112. Adding those together, 140 + 112 is 252 grams. Yep, same result. So that's another way to see it.\n\nSo either way I approach it, the answer is 252 grams. Looking back at the options, C is 252 gms, so that must be the correct choice.\n\nWait, but let me glance over the other options to make sure I didn't misread any. Option A is 450, which is way higher than what I got. Option B is 100, which is too low. Option D is 240, which is close but not quite 252. So C is the right one.\n\nI think I've thought it through properly. No mistakes in the calculations that I can see. So I'm confident that the answer is C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to calculate 60% of 30% of 1400 grams.
