      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a car journey, and I need to figure out the answer. Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe car finishes a journey in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr. Now, they want to know what speed the car needs to go to cover the same distance in 10 hours instead. Hmm, right, so it's about speed and time. I remember that speed, time, and distance are related. Oh right, the formula is speed multiplied by time equals distance. So, distance = speed \u00d7 time.\n\nFirst, I should find out the distance of the journey. Since the car is going at 60 km/hr for 20 hours, the distance would be 60 multiplied by 20. Let me do that math. 60 times 20 is 1200. So the distance is 1200 kilometers.\n\nNow, the question says the same distance needs to be covered in 10 hours. So I need to find the new speed that would allow the car to travel 1200 km in 10 hours. Using the same formula, rearranged to solve for speed. Speed = distance / time. So plugging in the numbers, 1200 divided by 10. Let me calculate that. 1200 /10 is 120. So the speed needs to be 120 km/hr.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If the car goes 120 km/hr for 10 hours, then 120 *10 is 1200 km. Yep, that matches the original distance. So the speed needed is 120 km/hr.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is 120 kmph. So that's the correct answer. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything else. The question is about how much speed the car gains. Oh, right, the original speed was 60, so the gain is 120-60=60 km/hr. Wait, but the question asks how much speed does the car gain, not the increase. Wait, no, the wording is \"how much speed does the car gain?\" Maybe I misread that. Oh, no, the question says \"how much speed does the car gain?\" I think the intended meaning is what speed is required, not the gain in speed. Because if it were the gain, the answer would be 60 km/hr, but that's not an option. Wait, looking at the options, E is 80, but wait, the options have A and E as 80, that's a typo perhaps. Let me check the options again.\n\nThe options are A)80, B)50, C)120, D)70, E)80. So both A and E are 80. Hmm, that's probably a mistake. But regardless, according to my calculation, the required speed is 120, which is option C.\n\nSo the correct answer should be C.\n",

So the question says that a car finishes a journey in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr. Then, the same distance needs to be covered in 10 hours, and I need to find out how much speed the car gains. Hmm, I think I should start by finding the total distance of the journey.\n\nWait, right, because speed is distance over time. So if the car is going 60 km per hour for 20 hours, the distance would be speed multiplied by time. Let me calculate that. So 60 km/h multiplied by 20 hours equals 1200 km. Yeah, that makes sense because 60 times 20 is 1200. So the total distance is 1200 km.\n\nNow, the problem says the same distance needs to be covered in 10 hours instead of 20. So I need to find out what speed the car must go to cover 1200 km in 10 hours. Oh right, speed equals distance divided by time. So 1200 km divided by 10 hours would be... 120 km/h. Wait, that seems high, but okay. So the new speed required is 120 km/h.\n\nThe question asks how much speed the car gains. So the original speed was 60 km/h, and the new speed is 120 km/h. The gain would be the difference between the two. So 120 minus 60 is 60 km/h. But wait, looking at the options, I don't see 60 as an option. Hmm, let me double-check.\n\nWait, let me look at the options again. The options are A)80, B)50, C)120, D)70, E)80. Oh wait, E is the same as A, maybe a typo. So none of these are 60. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me go through again. The distance is 60 * 20 = 1200 km. Correct. Then, time is 10 hours, so speed is 1200 /10 = 120 km/h. That's correct. So the gain is 120 -60 = 60 km/h. But the options don't have 60. So maybe I misread the question.\n\nWait, the question is asking how much speed does the car gain. Oh wait, maybe it's asking for the increase in speed. So the original speed is 60, new is 120. So the gain is 60 km/h. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I did something wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Let me read it again. Oh, wait! Oh no, maybe I misread the time. Wait, no, the first part says 20 hours at 60 km/h. Second part says same distance in 10 hours. So no, that's correct. So the required speed is 120, which is 60 km/h faster.\n\nWait, but none of the options is 60. Hmm. So maybe I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me think differently. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the distance. Let me check: 60 km/h for 20 hours. 60 * 20 is indeed 1200. So that's correct.\n\nHmm. Maybe the question is about average speed or something else? Or perhaps it's a trick question. Wait, no. The question is straightforward: same distance, less time, find the required speed, then find the gain.\n\nWait, looking at the options again. Oh wait, option C is 120. So the new speed is 120, which is 60 km/h faster. But the options don't have 60. So maybe the options have a typo, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the increase in speed, but perhaps it's phrased as how much speed is gained, which would be 60 km/h. But since that's not an option, perhaps I'm wrong somewhere.\n\nWait, maybe I'm supposed to calculate the required increase in speed, but perhaps it's a different approach. Let me think. Oh wait, perhaps I'm confusing speed and time. Let me think about it differently.\n\nWait, the car goes 60 km/h for 20 hours. So in 1 hour, it goes 60 km. In 20 hours, 1200 km. To cover 1200 km in 10 hours, the speed must be 120 km/h. So the gain is 60 km/h. But the options don't have 60. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking at the options again. Oh wait, maybe I miscalculated the gain. 120 minus 60 is 60. But perhaps the options have a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the increase in speed, but the options are the new speed. But the question says \"how much speed does the car gain\", which I think refers to the increase.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased as \"how much speed does the car need to gain\", so the increase is 60 km/h. But again, the options don't have that. So maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is in the wrong units. Oh, but the options are in km/h, so that's consistent.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if the distance is the same. Wait, perhaps I'm wrong in calculating the distance. Let me do it again. 60 km/h *20 h = 1200 km. Correct. Then, 1200 km in 10 hours is 120 km/h. So the gain is 60 km/h. But the options don't have 60. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the options again. Oh wait, the options are A)80, B)50, C)120, D)70, E)80. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.\n\n\"A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain?\"\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased as how much the speed is increased, but maybe it's phrased differently. So the original speed is 60, new is 120, so the gain is 60. But perhaps the options have a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the speed gain in a different way.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe the problem is about the increase in speed, but perhaps it's the ratio or something else. But no, that doesn't make sense. The question is straightforward: what's the increase in speed required.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are correct and I'm missing something. Let me think again. Oh wait, maybe the question is about the average speed or something else. Wait, no, that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the average speed when going and returning, but no, the problem doesn't mention that. Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the car is going faster, so the gain is 120-60=60, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the gain in speed as (new speed)/(original speed) -1. But that would be 120/60=2, so 100% gain. But that's not the question either.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the increase in speed as a multiple, but that's not what it's phrased as. It says \"how much speed does the car gain,\" which I think is the absolute difference, 60 km/h. But that's not an option. So maybe the options are incorrect, or perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, let me think about the options again. Option C is 120, which is the correct new speed. So perhaps the question is asking for the new speed, not the gain. But the question says \"how much speed does the car gain,\" which I think refers to the increase. But maybe the options are wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the required speed, not the gain. So if that's the case, the correct answer is 120, which is option C.\n\nWait, the question is phrased as \"how much speed does the car gain.\" Hmm. So perhaps it's the increase, but since that's not an option, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the new speed, in which case the answer is 120, which is option C.\n\nBut the way the question is phrased, it says the car \"gains\" speed, which implies the increase. But since the options don't include 60, perhaps the intended answer is 120 km/h as the new speed. So the correct option is C)120 kmph.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain?\n\nHmm, right. So the car is going a certain distance, which takes 20 hours at 60 km per hour. Now, they're asking what speed it needs to go to cover the same distance in only 10 hours. And they want to know the increase in speed, I think. Like, how much faster does it have to go?\n\nWait, so first, I need to find out the distance of the journey. Because speed multiplied by time gives distance. So, the first part is speed * time equals distance.\n\nLet me calculate that. The speed is 60 km/hr, and the time is 20 hours. So, distance = 60 * 20. Let me do the math: 60 times 20 is 1200. Oh, so the distance is 1200 km.\n\nNow, they want to cover the same 1200 km in 10 hours instead of 20. So I need to find the new speed required. Because speed equals distance divided by time.\n\nSo, new speed = 1200 km / 10 hours. Let's compute that. 1200 divided by 10 is 120. So the new speed needed is 120 km/hr.\n\nWait, but the question is asking how much speed the car gains. So, the original speed was 60 km/hr, and now it's 120. So the gain is the difference between the two.\n\nSo, 120 minus 60 is 60 km/hr. Oh, wait, but wait the options don't have 60. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions: A)80, B)50, C)120, D)70, E)80. Oh, wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Because 60 isn't an option. Hmm, did I calculate wrong?\n\nWait, let me double-check. The first part: 60 km/h for 20 hours. 60*20=1200 km. Correct. Now, 1200 km in 10 hours: 1200/10=120 km/h. So the speed needed is 120, which is option C. But the question is asking how much speed does the car gain. Oh, right! Because the original speed is 60, so the gain is 120-60=60 km/h. But that's not an option. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the increase in speed, not the new speed. Because if the options don't have 60, but the answer choices have 80 and 120. So let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 60 km/h for 20 hours: 60*20=1200 km. Correct. Now, to cover 1200 km in 10 hours, speed is 1200/10=120 km/h. So the new speed is 120, which is 60 km/h more than before. But the options don't have 60. So perhaps the question is phrased differently.\n\nWait, the question says \"how much speed does the car gain.\" So perhaps it's asking for the new speed, not the increase. Then the answer would be 120, which is option C.\n\nLooking back at the options: C is 120. So the correct answer would be C.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Because I thought the question was about the gain, which would be 60. But if the options don't have that, perhaps the question is about the required speed, not the gain. Let me read the question again.\n\n\"If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain?\"\n\nWait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. \"Gain\" could mean the increase. So 60 km/h. But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should re-express the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the time is halved, so the speed needs to be doubled. Because if you have the same distance, time is inversely proportional to speed.\n\nSo original time is 20 hours, new time is 10, which is half. So speed must double. 60 * 2 = 120. So the new speed is 120, which is 60 more than before. But again, the options don't have 60.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased as \"how much speed does the car gain\", which is the increase.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out the answer step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a car journey and speed. Hmm, I remember from school that speed, time, and distance are related by the formula: speed equals distance divided by time. Oh right, so maybe I can use that here.\n\nAlright, the problem says a car finishes a journey in 20 hours at 60 km/hr. Then it asks, if the same distance is covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain? So the first part gives me the original speed and time, and the second part is about the same distance but a different time, and I need to find the new speed. Then, I think the question is asking for the increase in speed, like the difference between the new speed and the old one.\n\nWait, let me make sure. So the original speed is 60 km/h, time is 20 hours. The distance is the same for both scenarios. So I can calculate the distance first using the original speed and time. Then, using that distance, I can find the new speed when the time is halved, which is 10 hours. Once I have both speeds, I'll subtract the original from the new to find the gain in speed.\n\nOkay, let's do the first part. Distance equals speed multiplied by time. So original distance D = 60 km/h * 20 h. Let me compute that. 60 times 20 is 1200. So D is 1200 km. Got that.\n\nNow, the same distance is covered in 10 hours. So the new speed S must satisfy D = S * new time. So 1200 km = S * 10 h. Solving for S, I divide both sides by 10. So S is 1200 /10 = 120 km/h. So the new speed is 120 km/h.\n\nWait, the original speed was 60, now it's 120. So the gain is 120 -60 = 60 km/h? But wait, looking at the options, I don't see 60 as an option. Hmm, the options are A)80, B)50, C)120, D)70, E)80. Wait, E is same as A. That's probably a typo. So none of the options is 60. Did I do something wrong?\n\nWait, maybe I misread the question. Let me read again. Oh wait! The question says, \"how much speed does the car gain?\" Oh, maybe it's asking for the increase in speed, but maybe I made a mistake in my calculation. Let me double-check.\n\nOriginal speed: 60 km/h, time 20h. D=60*20=1200 km. Correct. Then time becomes 10h, so speed must be 1200/10=120 km/h. So the new speed is 120. So the gain is 120-60=60 km/h. But the options don't have 60. Did I miscalculate?\n\nWait, maybe I'm supposed to find the difference between the original and new speed. Oh, no, that's what I did. Hmm. Let me look at the options again. Oh wait, perhaps I read the options wrong. Let me check. Option C is 120, which is the new speed. But the question asks how much speed the car gains. Oh, wait, perhaps the question is asking for the new speed, not the gain. Because if the options don't have 60, maybe I misread the question.\n\nWait, let's read the question again. \"how much speed does the car gain?\" Oh, that's the increase. So the gain is 60 km/h.

But the options don't have 60. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the distance calculation. Let me recalculate. 60 km/h for 20 hours: 60 *20 is 1200. That's correct. Then 1200 km in 10 hours: 1200/10=120 km/h. Correct.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, option C is 120. So perhaps the question is asking for the new speed, not the gain.

Let me read it again. It says, \"how much speed does the car gain?\" So perhaps it's the difference between the new and old speed. So 120 -60=60. But no option for 60. So maybe I'm wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Oh, wait, perhaps the question is asking for the increase in speed, but maybe it's phrased as the new speed, so perhaps the correct answer is 120, which is option C. But then why is the question asking about \"gain\"?\n\nWait, the options include 120, which is option C. So perhaps the question is just asking for the required speed, not the gain. Or maybe I misread the original question. Let me check again.\n\nThe question says, \"how much speed does the car gain?\" So that's the difference. So the answer should be 60 km/h. But the options don't have that. Hmm, maybe the options are wrong, or I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the original time. Wait, the first journey is 20 hours at 60 km/h. So distance is 60*20=1200. If it's to be covered in 10 hours, speed is 120. So the gain is 60, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the units.

If the question is about the gain in speed, then the answer isn't among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking what speed is needed, so it's 120. So the correct answer would be C.\n\nWait, looking at the options, option C is 120 kmph. So perhaps that's the intended answer, despite the wording. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to compute the gain as 60, but since that's not an option, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe the question is about the speed gained, but in terms of how much the speed has to increase. So 60 km/h to reach 120, so gain is 60. But no option for that. So perhaps the question is phrased wrong, or I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is in a different context. Let me see. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the car gains speed, implying acceleration, but that's not the case here because it's a different speed over the same distance. So that's probably not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about average speed or something else, but I don't think so.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The options include 120, which is the correct new speed. So perhaps the question is intended to ask for the new speed, not the gain. So the correct answer is 120, which is option C.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out the answer step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a car journey and speed. Hmm, I remember from school that speed, time, and distance are related by the formula: speed equals distance divided by time. Oh right, so maybe I can use that here.\n\nAlright, the problem says a car finishes a journey in 20 hours at 60 km/hr. Then it asks, if the same distance is covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain? So the first part gives me the original speed and time, and the second part is about the same distance but a different time, and I need to find the new speed. Then, I think the question is asking for the increase in speed, like the difference between the new speed and the old one.\n\nWait, let me make sure. So the original speed is 60 km/h, time is 20 hours. The distance is the same for both scenarios. So I can calculate the distance first using the original speed and time. Then, using that distance, I can find the new speed when the time is halved, which is 10 hours. Once I have both speeds, I'll subtract the original from the new to find the gain in speed.\n\nOkay, let's do the first part. Distance equals speed multiplied by time. So original distance D = 60 km/h * 20 h. Let me compute that. 60 times 20 is 1200. So D is 1200 km. Got that.\n\nNow, the same distance is covered in 10 hours. So the new speed S must satisfy D = S * new time. So 1200 km = S * 10 h. Solving for S, I divide both sides by 10. So S is 1200 /10 = 120 km/h. So the new speed is 120 km/h.\n\nWait, the original speed was 60, now it's 120. So the gain is 120 -60 = 60 km/h? But wait, looking at the options, I don't see 60 as an option. Hmm, the options are A)80, B)50, C)120, D)70, E)80. Wait, E is same as A. That's probably a typo. So none of the options is 60. Did I do something wrong?\n\nWait, maybe I misread the question. Let me read again. Oh wait! The question says, \"how much speed does the car gain?\" Oh, maybe it's asking for the increase in speed, but maybe I made a mistake in my calculation. Let me double-check.\n\nOriginal speed: 60 km/h, time 20h. D=60*20=1200 km. Correct. Then time becomes 10h, so speed must be 1200/10=120 km/h. So the new speed is 120. So the gain is 120-60=60 km/h. But the options don't have 60. Did I miscalculate?\n\nWait, maybe I'm supposed to find the difference between the original and new speed. Oh, no, that's what I did. Hmm. Let me look at the options again. Oh wait, perhaps I read the options wrong. Let me check. Option C is 120, which is the new speed. But the question asks how much speed the car gains. Oh, wait, perhaps the question is asking for the new speed, not the gain.

Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe problem says: A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain?\n\nHmm, right. So the car is going a certain distance. First, it takes 20 hours at 60 km/h. Then, they want to know what speed it needs to go to cover the same distance in half the time, which is 10 hours. So the question is asking about the increase in speed needed.\n\nI remember that distance equals speed multiplied by time, right? So the formula is D = S \u00d7 T. So I can find the distance first, then find the new speed needed for the shorter time.\n\nLet me calculate the distance first. The car is going 60 km/h for 20 hours. So D = 60 * 20. Let me compute that: 60 times 20 is 1200. So the distance is 1200 km.\n\nNow, the same distance (1200 km) needs to be covered in 10 hours. So I need to find the speed required for that. Using the same formula, D = S \u00d7 T. Rearranging to solve for speed, S = D / T.\n\nSo S = 1200 / 10. Let me do that division. 1200 divided by 10 is 120. So the speed needs to be 120 km/h.\n\nWait, but the question is asking how much speed does the car gain. Oh right, so it's the increase from the original speed. The original speed was 60 km/h, and the new speed is 120. So the gain is 120 - 60 = 60 km/h.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, let me check what's given.

Oh, perhaps a typo in the options? Because the correct speed is 120 km/h, which is option C. But wait, the question is asking how much speed does the car gain. So the gain is 60 km/h, right?

It says, \"how much speed does the car gain?\" Oh, maybe they're asking for the new speed, not the increase. Because the options include 120, which is the new speed. So perhaps I misread the question. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question: \"how much speed does the car gain?\" Hmm, that could be ambiguous. Gain could mean the increase, but if the options don't have 60, but do have 120, perhaps the question is asking for the new speed. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA)80 kmph\nB)50 kmph\nC)120 kmph\nD)70 kmph\nE)80 kmph\n\nSo option C is 120. So perhaps the question is asking for the new speed, not the gain. Because if the gain was 60, that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me redo the calculations. Distance is speed multiplied by time. So initial speed is 60, time 20: 60 * 20 = 1200 km. Correct. Then, to cover 1200 km in 10 hours, speed is 1200 / 10 = 120 km/h. So the new speed is 120. So the gain is 60 km/h. But since 60 is not an option, maybe the question is actually asking for the new speed, which is 120, so option C.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says \"how much speed does the car gain.\" That phrasing is a bit confusing. If the car was going 60 and now goes 120, the gain is 60 km/h. But since 60 isn't an option, perhaps the problem intended to ask for the new speed, not the gain. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the original time. Let me double-check. The journey is 20 hours at 60 km/h. So yes, D = 60 *20=1200. Then 1200 km in 10 hours requires 120 km/h. So the increase is 60, but that's not an option. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the options again, option C is 120. So perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, and the intended answer is 120 km/h, which is option C.\n\nBut why would the options have 80 twice (A and E)? That's probably a mistake, but perhaps not. So perhaps the correct answer is C, 120 km/h.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a car journey, and I need to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe problem says: A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain?\n\nHmm, right. So the car is going a certain distance. First, it takes 20 hours at 60 km/h. Then, they want to know what speed it needs to go to cover the same distance in half the time, which is 10 hours. So the question is asking about the increase in speed needed.\n\nI remember that distance equals speed multiplied by time, right? So the formula is D = S \u00d7 T. So I can find the distance first, then find the new speed needed for the shorter time.\n\nLet me calculate the distance first. The car is going 60 km/h for 20 hours. So D = 60 * 20. Let me compute that: 60 times 20 is 1200. So the distance is 1200 km.\n\nNow, the same distance (1200 km) needs to be covered in 10 hours. So I need to find the speed required for that. Using the same formula, D = S \u00d7 T. Rearranging to solve for speed, S = D / T.\n\nSo S = 1200 / 10. Let me do that division. 1200 divided by 10 is 120. So the speed needs to be 120 km/h.\n\nWait, but the question is asking how much speed does the car gain. Oh right, so it's the increase from the original speed. The original speed was 60 km/h, and the new speed is 120. So the gain is 120 - 60 = 60 km/h.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, let me check what's given. The options are A)80, B)50, C)120, D)70, E)80. Hmm, wait, option C is 120. Oh wait, but wait a second, I think I might have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, the options are: A is 80, E is 80 again. Oh, perhaps a typo in the options? Because the correct speed is 120 km/h, which is option C. But wait, the question is asking how much speed does the car gain. So the gain is 60 km/h, right? Because 120 - 60 is 60. But none of the options have 60. Wait, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, let me re-read the question. It says, \"how much speed does the car gain?\" Oh, maybe they're asking for the new speed, not the increase. Because the options include 120, which is the new speed. So perhaps I misread the question. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question: \"how much speed does the car gain?\" Hmm, that could be ambiguous. Gain could mean the increase, but if the options don't have 60, but do have 120, perhaps the question is asking for the new speed. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA)80 kmph\nB)50 kmph\nC)120 kmph\nD)70 kmph\nE)80 kmph\n\nSo option C is 120. So perhaps the question is asking for the new speed, not the gain. Because if the gain was 60, that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me redo the calculations. Distance is speed multiplied by time. So initial speed is 60, time 20: 60 * 20 = 1200 km. Correct. Then, to cover 1200 km in 10 hours, speed is 1200 / 10 = 120 km/h. So the new speed is 120. So the gain is 60 km/h. But since 60 is not an option, maybe the question is actually asking for the new speed, which is 120, so option C.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says \"how much speed does the car gain.\" That phrasing is a bit confusing. If the car was going 60 and now goes 120, the gain is 60 km/h. But since 60 isn't an option, perhaps the problem intended to ask for the new speed, not the gain. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the original time. Let me double-check. The journey is 20 hours at 60 km/h. So yes, D = 60 *20=1200. Then 1200 km in 10 hours requires 120 km/h. So the increase is 60, but that's not an option. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the options again, option C is 120. So perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, and the intended answer is 120 km/h, which is option C.\n\nBut why would the options have 80 twice (A and E)? That's probably a mistake, but perhaps not. So perhaps the correct answer is C, 120 km/h.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by calculating the distance of the journey using the formula \\( D = S \\times T \\), where \\( S \\) is speed and \\( T \\) is time. Given that the car travels at 60 km/h for 20 hours, the distance is:\n\n\\[\nD = 60 \\, \\text{km/h} \\times 20 \\, \\text{h} = 1200 \\, \\text{km}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the speed required to cover the same distance of 1200 km in 10 hours. Using the formula \\( S = \\frac{D}{T} \\), we calculate:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{1200 \\, \\text{km}}{10 \\, \\text{h}} = 120 \\, \\text{km/h}.\n\\]\n\nThe question asks \"how much speed does the car gain?\" This could be interpreted as either the increase in speed or the new speed. The original speed is 60 km/h, and the new speed is 120 km/h, so the gain in speed is:\n\n\\[\n120 \\, \\text{km/h} - 60 \\, \\text{km/h} = 60 \\, \\text{km/h}.\n\\]\n\nHowever, since 60 km/h is not an option, it is likely that the question is asking for the new speed. Among the given options, the correct new speed is 120 km/h, which corresponds to option C.\n\nAnswer: C",

If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain?\n\nHmm, I think I can solve this. Let me break it down. So, the car is traveling a certain distance. I need to find out what speed it needs to go to cover that same distance in half the time, which is 10 hours instead of 20.\n\nWait, right, speed, time, and distance are related by the formula: distance = speed \u00d7 time. So, if I can find the distance first, then I can figure out the required speed for the shorter time.\n\nAlright, let's calculate the distance first. The car's speed is 60 km/hr, and it took 20 hours. So distance equals 60 multiplied by 20. Let me do that math: 60 \u00d7 20 is 1200 km. So the total distance of the journey is 1200 kilometers.\n\nNow, the same distance needs to be covered in 10 hours instead of 20. So I need to find out what speed the car must maintain to cover 1200 km in 10 hours.\n\nUsing the same formula, distance equals speed multiplied by time. So, rearranging the formula to solve for speed, we get speed = distance divided by time. So, speed = 1200 km / 10 hours.\n\nLet me calculate that. 1200 divided by 10 is 120. So the speed needs to be 120 km/hr.\n\nWait a second, the question is asking how much speed the car gains. So the original speed was 60 km/hr, and the new speed is 120 km/hr. The gain would be the difference between the two speeds.\n\nSo, 120 minus 60 equals 60 km/hr. But wait, looking at the options, I don't see 60 as an option. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA)80 kmph\nB)50 kmph\nC)120 kmph\nD)70 kmph\nE)80 kmph\n\nHmm, wait, both A and E are 80. That's probably a typo, but in any case, none of the options are 60. So did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, maybe I misread the question. Let me read it again. It says, \"how much speed does the car gain?\" So is it the required speed (which would be 120 km/h) or the increase in speed (which would be 60 km/h)? \n\nWait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me parse it. The same distance is to be covered in 10 hours. So the required speed is 120 km/h. So the gain is 120 - 60 = 60 km/h. But none of the options match that. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the options again, option C is 120 kmph. So perhaps the question is asking for the new speed, not the gain. Because the way it's phrased, \"how much speed does the car gain?\" could be interpreted as the difference. But perhaps the options are giving the possible new speed, not the gain.\n\nWait, the wording says \"how much speed does the car gain?\" which implies the increase. So the correct answer should be 60 km/h. But that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in my initial calculation.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Distance is speed \u00d7 time. So original speed 60 km/h, time 20 h, distance is 1200 km.\n\nIn 10 hours, to cover the same distance, speed needed is 1200 /10 = 120 km/h. So the gain is 120 -60 = 60 km/h. But again, 60 isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the required speed, not the gain. If that's the case, then 120 km/h is the correct answer, which is option C.\n\nBut the question says, \"how much speed does the car gain?\" which makes me think it's asking for the increase. So the options don't have 60, which suggests that perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the initial problem. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the initial speed is 60 km/h, time 20 hours. So the distance is 60 *20 =1200 km. Correct. Then, in 10 hours, speed must be 1200 /10= 120 km/h. So the required speed is 120 km/h, which is 60 km/h more than before.\n\nBut none of the options have 60. So perhaps the question is actually asking for the new speed, not the gain. Then the answer would be 120 km/h, which is option C.\n\nWait, but the options have C as 120 and E as 80. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to compute something else. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased as 'how much speed does the car gain' meaning the increased speed. So, original speed is 60, new speed is 120, so the gain is 60. But 60 isn't an option.\n\nSo perhaps the options are wrong, or perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the distance.
