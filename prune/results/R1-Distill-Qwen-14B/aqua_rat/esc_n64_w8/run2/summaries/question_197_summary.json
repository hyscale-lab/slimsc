      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how much a mango costs based on the given prices of other fruits. Hmm, let me see. The problem says that an orange is $18, a pineapple is $27, and a grape is $15. I need to find the mango's price using the same logic.\n\nWait, but how do these prices relate? Maybe there's a pattern or a specific rule that connects them. Let me think about possible patterns. One common approach is to look at the digits of the numbers. Let's break down each fruit's price into its individual digits.\n\nOrange is $18. So that's 1 and 8. Pineapple is $27, which is 2 and 7. Grape is $15, so 1 and 5. Hmm, what do these digits have in common? Maybe adding them up or something else.\n\nWait, let me think about the fruits themselves. Oranges, pineapples, grapes, and mangoes are all fruits, but that doesn't immediately help. Maybe the number of letters in the fruit's name? Let me count.\n\nOrange: O-R-A-N-G-E. That's 6 letters. $18. Hmm, 6 and 18. Maybe 6 multiplied by 3 is 18? Or perhaps the sum of the letters' positions in the alphabet.\n\nWait, maybe each letter corresponds to a number, like A=1, B=2, etc. Let's calculate that for each fruit.\n\nFor orange: O is 15, R is 18, A is 1, N is 14, G is 7, E is 5. Adding those: 15+18=33, +1=34, +14=48, +7=55, +5=60. So the sum is 60. But the price is 18. Hmm, doesn't match. Maybe it's the sum divided by something? 60 divided by 3 is 20, which is not 18. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of the letters in a different way. Like the number of vowels and consonants? Orange has O, A, E as vowels (3 vowels), and R, N, G as consonants (3 consonants). 3 vowels and 3 consonants. But how does that relate to 18? Maybe 3 + 3 =6, but 6 doesn't equal 18. Maybe multiply: 3 *3 =9, still not 18. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the price is based on the number of syllables in the fruit's name. Orange has one syllable. Pineapple has two syllables. Grape has one syllable. But that doesn't directly explain the prices. Let's see:\n\nOrange: 1 syllable \u2192 $18. Pineapple: 2 \u2192 $27. Grape: 1 \u2192 $15. So 1 syllable could be 18 or 15, which doesn't fit a clear pattern. Maybe it's not syllables.\n\nWait, perhaps it's based on the number of letters multiplied by something. Orange has 6 letters, which gives 6. $18 is 6 *3. Pineapple has 9 letters: 9 *3 is 27. Oh! Wait a minute. That seems to fit. Let me check grape: grape has 5 letters. 5 *3 is 15. Yes, that matches. So the pattern is the number of letters in the fruit's name multiplied by 3 gives the price.\n\nSo if that's the case, then mango should follow the same rule. How many letters does mango have? Let's see: M-A-N-G-O. That's 5 letters. So 5 *3 =15. But wait, the options don't have 15 as the first choice. Let me look again. Option B is 15. So that would be the price. But wait, in the given options, option B is 15. So mango would cost $15.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. Orange: 6 letters \u2192 6*3=18. Correct. Pineapple: 9 letters \u21929*3=27. Correct. Grape:5 letters\u21925*3=15. Correct. So mango is 5 letters. So 5*3=15. So answer is B) 15.\n\nBut wait, the options include E)10, which is 5*2, but why would the pattern change for mango? No, the pattern is consistent so far. So mango should be 15. So the answer is B.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about fruit prices, and I need to figure out how much a mango costs. Let me read the problem again carefully.\n\nThe question says: At my favorite fruit stand, an orange costs 18 dollars, a pineapple costs 27 dollars, and a grape costs 15 dollars. Using the same logic, can you tell how much a mango costs?\n\nHmm, the options are A)22, B)15, C)20, D)18, E)10.\n\nWait, but wait. The problem is asking me to use the same logic as the prices given for the other fruits. I'm a bit confused because I don't see an obvious pattern yet. Let me think about possible patterns.\n\nFirst, maybe it's about the number of letters in the fruit's name. Let's check:\n\n- Orange: O-R-A-N-G-E. That's 6 letters.\n- Pineapple: P-I-N-E-A-P-P-L-E. Wait, how many letters is that? Let me count: P (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), A (5), P (6), P (7), L (8), E (9). So 9 letters.\n- Grape: G-R-A-P-E. That's 5 letters.\n\nBut the prices are 18, 27, 15 respectively. How does that relate?\n\nWait, maybe it's the number of letters multiplied by something. Let's see:\n\nOrange: 6 letters. 6 * 3 = 18. Oh, that works because 18 is the price.\n\nPineapple: 9 letters. 9 * 3 = 27. That matches too.\n\nGrape: 5 letters. 5 * 3 = 15. Perfect, that's the price given.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be the number of letters in the fruit's name multiplied by 3 to get the price.\n\nSo if that's the case, then mango's price would be determined by the number of letters in \"mango\".\n\nLet's count: M-A-N-G-O. That's 5 letters.\n\nSo 5 * 3 = 15. So the price should be 15 dollars. Looking at the options, that's option B.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me check if there's another possible pattern I might have missed. Sometimes, these problems can have multiple possible patterns, and I don't want to make a wrong assumption.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe it's based on the number of vowels or consonants? Let's check.\n\nOrange: O, A, E. So 3 vowels. 3 * something? 3*6=18? Or maybe not. Or maybe 3 vowels plus consonants? O has 3 letters, but that might complicate it.\n\nPineapple: vowels are I, E, A, E. That's 4 vowels. 4* something is 27? 27 /4 is not a whole number, so maybe not.\n\nGrape: A, E. 2 vowels. 2 *7.5=15. Hmm, but 7.5 isn't a nice number, and the prices are all integers. So maybe not vowels.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe it's based on the number of syllables. Orange is one syllable. Pineapple is two syllables. Grape is one syllable. But then, how would that fit with the prices? 18, 27,15. 18 is for one syllable, 27 for two, 15 for one. That doesn't fit a clear pattern like multiplying by 3. So perhaps not syllables.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the letters' positions in the alphabet. Let's see.\n\nOrange: O (15), R(18), A(1), N(14), G(7), E(5). Sum is 15+18+1+14+7+5 = 50. 50 doesn't equal 18. So that's not it.\n\nPineapple: P(16), I(9), N(14), E(5), A(1), P(16), P(16), L(12), E(5). Sum is 16+9=25, +14=39, +5=44, +1=45, +16=61, +16=77, +12=89, +5=94. 94 isn't 27.\n\nHmm, that's not working either. Maybe it's the sum of the digits in each letter's position. For example, O is 15: 1+5=6. R is 18:1+8=9. A is 1:1. N is14:1+4=5. G is7:7. E is5:5. So sum of these would be 6+9+1+5+7+5= 33. Not 18. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the count of vowels plus consonants multiplied by something. Wait, but earlier I saw that the letter count multiplied by 3 worked. Let me stick with that for now.\n\nSo, mango has 5 letters. 5 *3=15. So the price should be 15 dollars, which is option B. So I think that's the right answer.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about the prices of fruits at a fruit stand, and I'm supposed to figure out how much a mango costs based on the given prices of an orange, pineapple, and grape. Hmm, the prices are 18, 27, and 15 dollars respectively. I need to find a pattern or some kind of logic here.\n\nLet me write down the fruits and their prices to see if I can spot a pattern. So:\n\nOrange: $18\nPineapple: $27\nGrape: $15\nMango: ? \n\nWait, what do these fruits have in common? Maybe looking at their names could help. Or maybe the number of letters? Let's see:\n\nOrange has 6 letters. 18 divided by 6 is 3. Hmm, 3 is maybe the number of syllables? Orange is one syllable. Wait, no, that doesn't fit. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the letters correspond to numbers in some way. Like, the position of each letter in the alphabet. Let's try that.\n\nOrange: O, R, A, N, G, E.\nO is 15, R is 18, A is 1, N is 14, G is 7, E is 5. Hmm, adding those together: 15+18=33, +1=34, +14=48, +7=55, +5=60. That's 60. But the price is 18, so that doesn't fit. Maybe multiplying? Or perhaps taking the first letter?\n\nWait, the first letters: O is 15, P is 16, G is 7. Let's see the prices:\n\nOrange: O (15) \u2192 18\nPineapple: P (16) \u2192 27\nGrape: G (7) \u219215\nHmm, does 15 relate to 18? 15 +3=18. P is 16, price is 27. 16+11=27. G is 7, price is 15. 7+8=15. That doesn't seem consistent.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe the prices are based on the number of vowels in each fruit's name. Let's count vowels (a, e, i, o, u, sometimes y, but let's see).\n\nOrange: O, A, E \u2192 3 vowels. 3 times something is 18? 3*6=18. Pineapple: I, A, E, A, E \u2192 5 vowels. 5*5.4=27? That doesn't make sense. Or perhaps 3*6=18, 5*5.4? Doesn't fit. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, the number of consonants. Orange has R, N, G \u2192 3 consonants. 3*6=18. Pineapple: P, N, L, P, L \u21925 consonants. 5*5.4=27? Again, not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the sum of the letters' positions. Let me try that for each fruit.\n\nOrange: O(15) + R(18) + A(1) + N(14) + G(7) + E(5) = 15+18=33; 33+1=34; 34+14=48; 48+7=55; 55+5=60. So 60. But price is 18. 60 divided by something? 60/ (number of letters) 6 \u2192 10, but 18 is the price. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the first and last letters. O and E. O is 15, E is 5. 15 +5=20. Not 18. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the number of letters times a certain value. Orange has 6 letters. 6*3=18. Pineapple has 9 letters (P-I-N-E-A-P-P-L-E \u2192 let me count: P(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), A(5), P(6), P(7), L(8), E(9). So 9 letters. 9*3=27. Oh, that matches! Grape has 5 letters: G(1), R(2), A(3), P(4), E(5). 5 letters. 5*3=15. Oh, that fits too! So the pattern is number of letters multiplied by 3 equals the price.\n\nSo applying that to Mango. Let's count the letters in Mango. M-A-N-G-O. That's 5 letters. So 5 *3=15. Wait, but 15 is an option, option B. But wait, wait, let me double-check the letters. M-A-N-G-O: M is 1, A is 2, N is3, G is4, O is5. So 5 letters. So 5*3=15. So the price should be 15. But wait, looking at the options, B is 15. But wait, wait, what about the other fruits? Orange is 6 letters, 6*3=18. Correct. Pineapple is 9 letters, 9*3=27. Correct. Grape is 5 letters, 5*3=15. Correct.\n\nSo mango is 5 letters? Wait, no, wait. M-A-N-G-O is 5 letters. So 5 *3=15.

M is 1, A is 2, N is3, G is4, O is5. Yes, 5 letters. So 5*3=15.\n\nBut wait, the given options are A to E, with B being 15. So that should be the answer.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this question about the prices of fruits at a fruit stand, and I'm supposed to figure out how much a mango costs based on the given prices of an orange, pineapple, and grape. Hmm, the prices are 18, 27, and 15 dollars respectively. I need to find a pattern or some kind of logic here.\n\nLet me write down the fruits and their prices to see if I can spot a pattern. So:\n\nOrange: $18\nPineapple: $27\nGrape: $15\nMango: ? \n\nWait, what do these fruits have in common? Maybe looking at their names could help. Or maybe the number of letters? Let's see:\n\nOrange has 6 letters. 18 divided by 6 is 3. Hmm, 3 is maybe the number of syllables? Orange is one syllable. Wait, no, that doesn't fit. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the letters correspond to numbers in some way. Like, the position of each letter in the alphabet. Let's try that.\n\nOrange: O, R, A, N, G, E.\nO is 15, R is 18, A is 1, N is 14, G is 7, E is 5. Hmm, adding those together: 15+18=33, +1=34, +14=48, +7=55, +5=60. That's 60. But the price is 18, so that doesn't fit. Maybe multiplying? Or perhaps taking the first letter?\n\nWait, the first letters: O is 15, P is 16, G is 7. Let's see the prices:\n\nOrange: O (15) \u2192 18\nPineapple: P (16) \u2192 27\nGrape: G (7) \u219215\nHmm, does 15 relate to 18? 15 +3=18. P is 16, price is 27. 16+11=27. G is 7, price is 15. 7+8=15. That doesn't seem consistent.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe the prices are based on the number of vowels in each fruit's name. Let's count vowels (a, e, i, o, u, sometimes y, but let's see).\n\nOrange: O, A, E \u2192 3 vowels. 3 times something is 18? 3*6=18. Pineapple: I, A, E, A, E \u2192 5 vowels. 5*5.4=27? That doesn't make sense. Or perhaps 3*6=18, 5*5.4? Doesn't fit. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, the number of consonants. Orange has R, N, G \u2192 3 consonants. 3*6=18. Pineapple: P, N, L, P, L \u21925 consonants. 5*5.4=27? Again, not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the sum of the letters' positions. Let me try that for each fruit.\n\nOrange: O(15) + R(18) + A(1) + N(14) + G(7) + E(5) = 15+18=33; 33+1=34; 34+14=48; 48+7=55; 55+5=60. So 60. But price is 18. 60 divided by something? 60/ (number of letters) 6 \u2192 10, but 18 is the price. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the first and last letters. O and E. O is 15, E is 5. 15 +5=20. Not 18. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the number of letters times a certain value. Orange has 6 letters. 6*3=18. Pineapple has 9 letters (P-I-N-E-A-P-P-L-E \u2192 let me count: P(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), A(5), P(6), P(7), L(8), E(9). So 9 letters. 9*3=27. Oh, that matches! Grape has 5 letters: G(1), R(2), A(3), P(4), E(5). 5 letters. 5*3=15. Oh, that fits too! So the pattern is number of letters multiplied by 3 equals the price.\n\nSo applying that to Mango. Let's count the letters in Mango. M-A-N-G-O. That's 5 letters. So 5 *3=15. Wait, but 15 is an option, option B. But wait, wait, let me double-check the letters. M-A-N-G-O: M is 1, A is 2, N is3, G is4, O is5. So 5 letters. So 5*3=15. So the price should be 15. But wait, looking at the options, B is 15. But wait, wait, what about the other fruits? Orange is 6 letters, 6*3=18. Correct. Pineapple is 9 letters, 9*3=27. Correct. Grape is 5 letters, 5*3=15. Correct.\n\nSo mango is 5 letters? Wait, no, wait. M-A-N-G-O is 5 letters. So 5 *3=15. So the price should be 15, which is option B. But wait, the options are A)22, B)15, C)20, D)18, E)10.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me recount the letters in Mango. M is 1, A is 2, N is3, G is4, O is5. Yes, 5 letters. So 5*3=15.\n\nBut wait, the given options are A to E, with B being 15. So that should be the answer.

Hmm, but what's the pattern here?\n\nLet me look at the numbers again. Orange is 18, pineapple is 27, grape is 15. I wonder if these numbers relate to something else, like the number of letters in the fruit's name. Let me count:\n\n- Orange has 5 letters. But 5 doesn't relate to 18. Maybe not the number of letters.\n- Pineapple has 9 letters. 9 times 3 is 27. Oh wait, pineapple is 27. So 9 times 3 is 27. Maybe it's the number of letters multiplied by something?\n- Grape has 5 letters. 5 times 3 is 15, which matches the given price. Wait, that's interesting. So for grape, 5 letters times 3 equals 15. Pineapple, 9 letters times 3 is 27. Orange is 5 letters, but 5 times 3 is 15, but the price is 18. That doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe there's another pattern.\n\nWait, maybe it's not the number of letters. Let's think about something else. Maybe the cost is based on the number of vowels in the fruit's name. Let's see:\n\n- Orange: O, A, E. Wait, O is the first letter, but vowels are A, E, I, O, U. So Orange has O and E. That's two vowels. 2 times 9 is 18. Oh, that's the price! So 2 vowels times 9 equals 18.\n\n- Pineapple: Let's count the vowels. I, A, E. Wait, let me spell pineapple: P-I-N-E-A-P-P-L-E. Vowels are I, E, A, E. That's four vowels. 4 times 6.75 equals 27? Hmm, 4 times 6.75 is 27. But that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe it's a different multiplier.\n\nWait, maybe each vowel corresponds to a certain value. Let me think again. Orange has two vowels, cost is 18. So 2 times 9 is 18. Pineapple has four vowels, 4 times 6.75 is 27, but that's not a clean number. Maybe there's a different approach.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe the cost is the number of letters multiplied by the number of vowels. For orange: 5 letters, 2 vowels. 5*2=10, but the price is 18. Doesn't fit. Pineapple: 9 letters, 4 vowels. 9*4=36, which is double the price of 27. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe it's the sum of the letters' positions in the alphabet. Let's try that. For example, orange: O is 15, R is 18, A is 1, N is 14, G is 7, E is 5. Summing these: 15+18+1+14+7+5 = 50. That's not 18. So probably not that.\n\nWait, maybe it's the number of syllables. Orange has one syllable. 18 divided by 1 is 18. Pineapple has two syllables: 27 divided by 2 is 13.5. That doesn't make sense. Grape has one syllable: 15 divided by 1 is 15. So that doesn't fit a pattern either.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look for a mathematical pattern between the fruits. Orange is 18, pineapple 27, grape 15. Wait, 18 is 15 plus 3, but pineapple is 27 which is 15 plus 12. Not sure about that.\n\nWait, maybe the cost is based on the number of segments or parts in the fruit. Like, how many sections an orange has, but that seems unlikely. Or perhaps the number of seeds? Or something like that. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the cost is based on the first and last letters. Let's see:\n\n- Orange: O and E. O is 15 (O is the 15th letter), E is 5. 15 +5 =20. Doesn't match 18.\n- Pineapple: P (16) and E (5). 16+5=21. 21 isn't 27.\n- Grape: G (7) and E (5). 7+5=12. Not 15. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the cost is based on the fruit's letters in some other way. Let's think of each letter as a number (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26). Then sum all letters of the fruit's name.\n\nLet me calculate:\n\nOrange: O(15) + R(18) + A(1) + N(14) + G(7) + E(5) = 15+18=33, +1=34, +14=48, +7=55, +5=60. 60 is not 18.\n\nPineapple: P(16) + I(9) + N(14) + E(5) + A(1) + P(16) + P(16) + L(12) + E(5).

So that's not it.\n\nHmm, maybe the number of letters multiplied by something else. Orange is 6 letters long. 6 * 3=18. Oh, that matches! Wait, pineapple is 9 letters. 9 * 3=27. Oh, that fits. Grape is 5 letters, 5*3=15. Wait, that works too! So the pattern is number of letters multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, wait a minute. Orange has 6 letters. 6 * 3 = 18. Pineapple has 9 letters. 9*3=27. Grape has 5 letters. 5*3=15. So yes, that seems to fit. So the cost is the number of letters in the fruit's name multiplied by 3.\n\nSo the next step is to find how many letters mango has.

Hmm, let me think.\n\nSo, the prices given are: orange is 18 dollars, pineapple is 27 dollars, grape is 15 dollars. The question is, using the same logic, what's the price of a mango? The options are A)22, B)15, C)20, D)18, E)10.\n\nWait, I'm trying to remember if there's a pattern or some kind of logic here. Maybe it's about the letters of the fruits or their names? Or perhaps it's about the number of letters? Let me check each fruit's name.\n\nOrange has 6 letters. Pineapple has 9 letters. Grape has 5 letters. Hmm, but how does that relate to the prices? Let's see the prices: 18, 27, 15.

Maybe it's the sum divided by something? 60 divided by something... 60/3 is 20, but orange is 18, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the price is the sum of the letters' positions divided by the number of letters. Orange has 6 letters. 60 divided by 6 is 10. But the price is 18. Hmm, that's not matching either.\n\nWait, maybe it's something else. Let's think about the number of vowels in each fruit's name. Orange has O, A, E: 3 vowels. Pineapple has I, E, A, E: 4 vowels. Grape has A, E: 2 vowels.\n\nBut the prices are 18, 27, 15. I don't see a direct correlation between vowels and price here. Let's see: 3 vowels for 18, 4 for 27, 2 for 15. Maybe 18 divided by 3 is 6, 27/4 is about 6.75, 15/2 is 7.5. Doesn't seem consistent.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's the number of consonants? Orange has 3 consonants (R, N, G), Pineapple has 5 consonants (P, N, P, L, L), Grape has 3 consonants (G, R, P). Prices: 18, 27, 15. 18/3=6, 27/5=5.4, 15/3=5. Still not matching.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe it's the position of the first letter in the alphabet. Orange starts with O, which is 15. The price is 18. That's 15 plus 3. Pineapple starts with P, which is 16. The price is 27, which is 16 + 11. Grape starts with G, 7, and price is 15, which is 7 + 8. Hmm, not a consistent pattern.\n\nWait, maybe it's the sum of the first and last letters' positions. Orange: O is 15, E is 5. 15+5=20. But the price is 18. Close, but not exactly. Pineapple: P is 16, E is 5. 16+5=21, but price is 27. No. Grape: G is 7, E is 5. 7+5=12, but price is 15. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe it's the product of the first and last letters. Orange: 15 *5=75. No, price is 18. Doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe the price is the number of letters multiplied by something. Orange has 6 letters, 6 * 3 =18. Pineapple has 9 letters, 9 *3=27. Grape has 5 letters, 5 *3=15. Oh! Wait a minute, that seems to fit. So each fruit's price is the number of letters in its name multiplied by 3. So, let's check:\n\nOrange: 6 letters *3=18 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPineapple: 9 letters *3=27 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGrape: 5 letters *3=15 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOh, that makes sense! So the logic here is that the price is 3 times the number of letters in the fruit's name.\n\nSo, applying the same logic, how many letters does mango have? Let me count: M-A-N-G-O. That's 5 letters. So 5 *3 =15. So the mango would cost 15 dollars. Looking at the options, B is 15.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The options are A)22, B)15, C)20, D)18, E)10.\n\nYes, B is 15.

No, wait: M is 1, A is 2, N is 3, G is4, O is5. So yes, five letters. So 5*3=15.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question here about the prices of fruits at a stand, and I need to figure out how much a mango costs. Let's see, the question gives me the prices of an orange, a pineapple, and a grape, and then asks me to use the same logic to find the mango's price. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let me list out what I know. An orange costs $18, a pineapple is $27, a grape is $15. And the options for the mango are A)22, B)15, C)20, D)18, E)10. I'm a bit stuck because the question doesn't provide any direct relationship between these fruits' prices. So I need to think about possible patterns or logical connections.\n\nOne approach could be looking for numerical patterns or mathematical relationships. Let me think: maybe adding or subtracting the prices to find a hidden pattern. Let's see:\n\nOrange is 18, pineapple 27, grape 15. What's the relationship between these numbers?\n\nWait, perhaps the number of letters in each fruit's name? Let me count.\n\nOrange has 5 letters (O-R-A-N-G-E). Pineapple has 9 letters (P-I-N-E-A-P-P-L-E). Grape has 5 letters (G-R-A-P-E). Hmm, so 5, 9, 5. But how does that help me find mango's price? Mango has 5 letters as well. Not sure if that's the right path.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the cost is based on something like vowels or consonants? Let's see. Orange: O, A, E are vowels\u2014so 3 vowels. Pineapple: I, E, A, E\u2014four vowels. Grape: A, E\u2014two vowels. Hmm, 3,4,2. Not seeing a clear pattern there.\n\nWait, what if the price is based on the number of syllables? Orange is one syllable. Pineapple is two. Grape is one. But mango is also one syllable. So if the pattern is based on syllables, maybe the price relates to that. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the letters in the name in some way. Like adding their alphabetical positions. Let me try that.\n\nFor orange: O is 15, R is 18, A is 1, N is 14, G is 7, E is 5. Adding those up: 15+18=33, +1=34, +14=48, +7=55, +5=60. Hmm, but orange's price is 18, so that doesn't directly match.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the sum of the letters' positions modulo something? Or perhaps the product? Maybe not, because the numbers are too big.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the first letters. Orange starts with O, pineapple with P, grape with G, mango with M. O, P, G, M. Maybe their positions in the alphabet. O is 15, P is 16, G is 7, M is 13. Hmm, but the prices are 18, 27, 15. Not matching directly.\n\nWait, perhaps the price is based on the sum of the letters in the name multiplied by something. Let's take orange: O(15) + R(18) + A(1) + N(14) + G(7) + E(5) = 15+18 is 33, plus 1 is 34, plus 14 is 48, plus 7 is 55, plus 5 is 60. So 60. But the price is 18. Hmm, 60 divided by something? 60 divided by 3.333 is 18, which is an orange's price. That seems a bit arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the number of vowels multiplied by something. Orange has 3 vowels. 3 multiplied by 6 is 18. Pineapple has 4 vowels, 4 multiplied by 6.75 is 27. Grape has 2 vowels, 2*7.5 is 15. That seems inconsistent, but maybe there's a pattern. For mango, which has two vowels (a and o?), wait, mango is M-A-N-G-O. So that's A and O, so two vowels. If the pattern is 2 multiplied by something, but in grape's case, 2*7.5=15. But mango is a different fruit. Maybe the multiplier is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the price is based on the number of vowels plus the number of consonants. For orange: 3 vowels and 3 consonants (R, N, G). 3+3=6. 6*3=18. Pineapple: 4 vowels, 5 consonants (P, N, P, P, L). 4+5=9. 9*3=27. Grape: 2 vowels, 3 consonants (G, R, P). 2+3=5. 5*3=15. Oh! That seems to fit. So the formula is (number of vowels + number of consonants) multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, wait, let's check that again. Orange: 3 vowels, 3 consonants. 3+3=6. 6*3=18. Correct. Pineapple: 4 vowels, 5 consonants. 4+5=9. 9*3=27. Correct. Grape: 2 vowels, 3 consonants. 2+3=5. 5*3=15. Correct. So that formula works for all given fruits.\n\nSo if that's the pattern, then for mango: let's see, M-A-N-G-O. The letters are M, A, N, G, O. So vowels are A and O (since A and O are vowels). So 2 vowels. Consonants are M, N, G. So 3 consonants. 2+3=5. Multiply by 3: 5*3=15. So the price would be $15. Looking at the options, B is 15. So is that the answer?\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Did I count the vowels correctly in mango? M-A-N-G-O: A and O are vowels. So yes, 2 vowels. Consonants: M, N, G. 3 consonants. So total letters 5, vowels 2, consonants 3. So 5 letters in total, 2 vowels, 3 consonants. So (2+3)*3=15. That seems correct. So the answer would be B)15.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, B is 15. So that's an option. But wait, another possibility: could the pattern be something else? Like the number of vowels multiplied by the number of consonants? Let's test that.\n\nOrange: 3 vowels, 3 consonants. 3*3=9. 9*2=18. Hmm, that works. Pineapple: 4 vowels, 5 consonants. 4*5=20. 20*1.35=27. That's not as clean. Grape: 2 vowels, 3 consonants. 2*3=6. 6*2.5=15. So that's also possible but the multipliers are inconsistent. So the earlier pattern seems more consistent.\n\nSo I think the correct answer is B)15.\n",

I'm a bit stuck because the question doesn't provide any direct relationship between these fruits' prices. So I need to think about possible patterns or logical connections.\n\nOne approach could be looking for numerical patterns or mathematical relationships. Let me think: maybe adding or subtracting the prices to find a hidden pattern. Let's see:\n\nOrange is 18, pineapple 27, grape 15. What's the relationship between these numbers?\n\nWait, perhaps the number of letters in each fruit's name? Let me count.\n\nOrange has 5 letters (O-R-A-N-G-E). Pineapple has 9 letters (P-I-N-E-A-P-P-L-E). Grape has 5 letters (G-R-A-P-E). Hmm, so 5, 9, 5. But how does that help me find mango's price? Mango has 5 letters as well. Not sure if that's the right path.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the cost is based on something like vowels or consonants? Let's see. Orange: O, A, E are vowels\u2014so 3 vowels. Pineapple: I, E, A, E\u2014four vowels. Grape: A, E\u2014two vowels. Hmm, 3,4,2. Not seeing a clear pattern there.\n\nWait, what if the price is based on the number of syllables? Orange is one syllable. Pineapple is two. Grape is one. But mango is also one syllable. So if the pattern is based on syllables, maybe the price relates to that. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the letters in the name in some way. Like adding their alphabetical positions. Let me try that.\n\nFor orange: O is 15, R is 18, A is 1, N is 14, G is 7, E is 5. Adding those up: 15+18=33, +1=34, +14=48, +7=55, +5=60. Hmm, but orange's price is 18, so that doesn't directly match.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the sum of the letters' positions modulo something? Or perhaps the product? Maybe not, because the numbers are too big.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the first letters. Orange starts with O, pineapple with P, grape with G, mango with M. O, P, G, M. Maybe their positions in the alphabet. O is 15, P is 16, G is 7, M is 13. Hmm, but the prices are 18, 27, 15. Not matching directly.\n\nWait, perhaps the price is based on the sum of the letters in the name multiplied by something. Let's take orange: O(15) + R(18) + A(1) + N(14) + G(7) + E(5) = 15+18 is 33, plus 1 is 34, plus 14 is 48, plus 7 is 55, plus 5 is 60. So 60. But the price is 18. Hmm, 60 divided by something? 60 divided by 3.333 is 18, which is an orange's price. That seems a bit arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the number of vowels multiplied by something. Orange has 3 vowels. 3 multiplied by 6 is 18. Pineapple has 4 vowels, 4 multiplied by 6.75 is 27. Grape has 2 vowels, 2*7.5 is 15. That seems inconsistent, but maybe there's a pattern. For mango, which has two vowels (a and o?), wait, mango is M-A-N-G-O. So that's A and O, so two vowels. If the pattern is 2 multiplied by something, but in grape's case, 2*7.5=15. But mango is a different fruit. Maybe the multiplier is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the price is based on the number of vowels plus the number of consonants. For orange: 3 vowels and 3 consonants (R, N, G). 3+3=6. 6*3=18. Pineapple: 4 vowels, 5 consonants (P, N, P, P, L). 4+5=9. 9*3=27. Grape: 2 vowels, 3 consonants (G, R, P). 2+3=5. 5*3=15. Oh! That seems to fit. So the formula is (number of vowels + number of consonants) multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, wait, let's check that again. Orange: 3 vowels, 3 consonants. 3+3=6. 6*3=18. Correct. Pineapple: 4 vowels, 5 consonants. 4+5=9. 9*3=27. Correct. Grape: 2 vowels, 3 consonants. 2+3=5. 5*3=15. Correct. So that formula works for all given fruits.\n\nSo if that's the pattern, then for mango: let's see, M-A-N-G-O. The letters are M, A, N, G, O. So vowels are A and O (since A and O are vowels). So 2 vowels. Consonants are M, N, G. So 3 consonants. 2+3=5. Multiply by 3: 5*3=15. So the price would be $15. Looking at the options, B is 15. So is that the answer?\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Did I count the vowels correctly in mango? M-A-N-G-O: A and O are vowels. So yes, 2 vowels. Consonants: M, N, G. 3 consonants. So total letters 5, vowels 2, consonants 3. So 5 letters in total, 2 vowels, 3 consonants. So (2+3)*3=15. That seems correct. So the answer would be B)15.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, B is 15. So that's an option. But wait, another possibility: could the pattern be something else? Like the number of vowels multiplied by the number of consonants? Let's test that.\n\nOrange: 3 vowels, 3 consonants. 3*3=9. 9*2=18. Hmm, that works. Pineapple: 4 vowels, 5 consonants. 4*5=20. 20*1.35=27. That's not as clean. Grape: 2 vowels, 3 consonants. 2*3=6. 6*2.5=15. So that's also possible but the multipliers are inconsistent. So the earlier pattern seems more consistent.\n\nSo I think the correct answer is B)15.\n\n\nTo determine the price of a mango, we analyze the given prices of other fruits and identify a pattern. The prices provided are as follows:\n\n- Orange: $18  \n- Pineapple: $27  \n- Grape: $15  \n\nWe hypothesize that the price is determined by the formula:  \n\\[\n\\text{Price} = (\\text{Number of vowels} + \\text{Number of consonants}) \\times 3\n\\]\n\n### Testing the Pattern:\n1. **Orange**:  \n   - Vowels: O, A, E (3 vowels)  \n   - Consonants: R, N, G (3 consonants)  \n   - Total: \\( (3 + 3) \\times 3 = 6 \\times 3 = 18 \\)  \n   - Matches the given price.\n\n2. **Pineapple**:  \n   - Vowels: I, E, A, E (4 vowels)  \n   - Consonants: P, N, P, P, L (5 consonants)  \n   - Total: \\( (4 + 5) \\times 3 = 9 \\times 3 = 27 \\)  \n   - Matches the given price.\n\n3. **Grape**:  \n   - Vowels: A, E (2 vowels)  \n   - Consonants: G, R, P (3 consonants)  \n   - Total: \\( (2 + 3) \\times 3 = 5 \\times 3 = 15 \\)  \n   - Matches the given price.\n\n### Applying the Pattern to Mango:\n- **Mango**:  \n  - Vowels: A, O (2 vowels)  \n  - Consonants: M, N, G (3 consonants)  \n  - Total: \\( (2 + 3) \\times 3 = 5 \\times 3 = 15 \\)\n\nThus, the price of a mango is **$15**, which corresponds to option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about the fruit stand prices, and I need to figure out how much a mango costs. Let me think this through step by step.\n\nAlright, the given prices are: orange is $18, pineapple is $27, grape is $15, and the question is about the mango. Hmm. The question says, \"using the same logic,\" so I guess there's some pattern or rule that connects these prices.\n\nLet me list out the fruits and their prices:\n\n- Orange: $18\n- Pineapple: $27\n- Grape: $15\n- Mango: ?\n\nWait, I need to find a pattern here. Maybe it's based on the letters in the fruit names. Let me check that.\n\nFor the orange: O is the 15th letter of the alphabet. R is 18th, A is 1st, N is 14th, G is 7th. Hmm, but how does that relate to $18? Maybe adding the letters' positions? Let me calculate.\n\nO (15) + R (18) + A (1) + N (14) + G (7) = 15+18=33, +1=34, +14=48, +7=55. That's 55, but the orange is $18. Doesn't seem to match.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe it's the number of letters in the word multiplied by something. Orange has 5 letters. 5 times what is 18? 5*3.6 is 18, which doesn't make much sense.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the sum of the digits in the price? Let's see. Orange is 18: 1+8=9. Pineapple is 27: 2+7=9. Grape is 15: 1+5=6. Hmm, that's inconsistent because orange and pineapple both have 9, but grape is 6. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the price is based on the number of vowels in the fruit's name. Let's see:\n\nOrange: O, A, E (wait, orange is O-R-A-N-G-E? Oh wait, no, the spelling is O-R-A-N-G-E. So vowels are O, A, E. That's 3 vowels. 3 times something. 3*6=18. Oh, that fits.\n\nPineapple: P-I-N-E-A-P-P-L-E. Vowels are I, E, A, E. That's 4 vowels. 4* something equals 27. 4*6.75=27. Hmm, that's a decimal, which is a bit odd.\n\nWait, maybe it's the number of syllables? Let's count. Orange: two syllables (O-range). Pineapple: three (pi-nea-pple). Grape: one syllable. Wait, but then for orange 2*9=18, pineapple 3*9=27, grape 1*15=15? That doesn't add up. Wait, grape is 1 syllable, but 1*15=15. That works. Orange is 2 syllables: 2 * 9 = 18. Pineapple is 3 syllables: 3 *9=27. So perhaps each syllable contributes $9. That seems to fit the first three fruits. So then mango: how many syllables does it have? Ma-n-go. That's two syllables. So 2 *9= $18. So mango would cost $18, which is option D.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Another possibility: maybe it's the number of letters. Orange has 6 letters. Wait, O-R-A-N-G-E is 6 letters. 6 *3=18. Pineapple has 9 letters: 9*3=27. Grape has 5 letters: 5*3=15. So that also fits. So mango has 5 letters: 5*3=15. But wait, mango is M-A-N-G-O, which is 5 letters. So that would be $15, which is option B. Hmm, but that contradicts the previous reasoning.\n\nWait, I'm getting conflicting possibilities. Let me see which pattern is more consistent.\n\nLooking again:\n\nOrange: 6 letters \u2192 6\u00d73=18. Correct.\n\nPineapple: 9 letters \u21929\u00d73=27. Correct.\n\nGrape: 5 letters \u21925\u00d73=15. Correct.\n\nMango:5 letters \u21925\u00d73=15 \u2192 option B.\n\nBut earlier, I thought about syllables. Orange:2\u00d79=18, pineapple:3\u00d79=27, grape:1\u00d79=9? Wait, no, grape is 15, which doesn't fit 9. So that breaks the syllable pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps the syllable approach isn't correct. So the letter count seems more consistent.\n\nWait, but let's check the letter count again:\n\nOrange: O-R-A-N-G-E \u21926 letters. 6\u00d73=18.\n\nPineapple: P-I-N-E-A-P-P-L-E \u21929 letters. 9\u00d73=27.\n\nGrape: G-R-A-P-E \u21925 letters. 5\u00d73=15.\n\nMango: M-A-N-G-O \u21925 letters. 5\u00d73=15. So that's option B.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait another thought: perhaps it's the number of letters in the fruit's name multiplied by the number of vowels.\n\nOrange: O, A, E \u21923 vowels. Letters:6. 6\u00d73=18.\n\nPineapple: I, E, A, E \u21924 vowels. Letters:9. 9\u00d74=36. But the price is 27, so that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe not. Let's think of another approach.\n\nAnother idea: the price is based on the sum of the letters' positions. Let me try that.\n\nFor Orange:\n\nO (15) + R (18) + A (1) + N (14) + G (7) + E (5) = 15+18=33 +1=34 +14=48 +7=55 +5=60. 60 is way more than 18. So that's not it.\n\nPineapple:\n\nP (16) + I (9) + N (14) + E (5) + A (1) + P (16) + P (16) + L (12) + E (5).\n\nCalculating:16+9=25+14=39+5=44+1=45+16=61+16=77+12=89+5=94. 94, but the price is 27. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe another approach: the price is the number of consonants multiplied by something.\n\nOrange: consonants are R, N, G \u21923 consonants. 3 \u00d76=18. Pineapple: consonants are P, N, P, P, L \u21925 consonants. 5 \u00d75.4=27. Doesn't seem consistent.\n\nWait, 3\u00d76=18, 5\u00d75.4=27. That's not a whole number, so maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the price is based on the vowels' positions. Let me see.\n\nOrange's vowels are O (15), A (1), E (5). Sum:15+1+5=21. Not 18.\n\nPineapple's vowels: I (9), E (5), A (1), E (5). Sum:9+5+1+5=20. Not 27.\n\nHmm. Not matching.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe it's the number of vowels multiplied by the number of consonants. Orange: 3 vowels, 3 consonants (R, N, G). 3\u00d73=9. Not 18. Doesn't fit.\n\nPineapple: 4 vowels, 5 consonants. 4\u00d75=20. Not 27.\n\nNot matching.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the vowels multiplied by some other number. Let me think. Orange:3 vowels \u21923\u00d76=18. Pineapple:4\u00d76.75=27. Again, decimals, which might not make sense.\n\nHmm. Let me think differently. Maybe it's based on the fruit's name in another language, but that seems unlikely for a logic puzzle.\n\nWait, another angle: perhaps the price is determined by the number of segments in the fruit when written. Like, how many lines or strokes are in the letters. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think about the spelling. Maybe the price is the sum of the letters' positions in the word, but only considering certain letters.\n\nWait, another thought: the price of each fruit is the sum of the digits in the number of letters. For example, orange has 6 letters \u21926 \u21926\u00d73=18? Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the reverse: the number of letters is the sum of the price's digits. Orange: 18 \u21921+8=9. But orange has 6 letters. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the price is the sum of the vowels' positions. Let's try that.\n\nOrange: O (15), A (1), E (5) \u2192 sum 15+1+5=21. Not 18.\n\nHmm. Not matching.\n\nWait, maybe it's the product of the vowels' positions. O (15) \u00d7 A (1) \u00d7 E (5) \u219215\u00d71=15\u00d75=75. No, that's way too high.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the number of vowels times the number of letters.\n\nOrange:3 vowels \u00d76 letters=18. Yes! That works for orange.\n\nPineapple:4 vowels \u00d79 letters=36. But pineapple is 27. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So that doesn't work for pineapple.\n\nWait, maybe it's the number of vowels multiplied by something else. For orange: 3 vowels \u00d76=18. So 3\u00d76=18.\n\nPineapple:4 vowels \u00d7 (something) =27. 27/4 is 6.75. Not a whole number.\n\nHmm. Not matching.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the price is the square of the number of letters. Orange:6 letters \u21926^2=36. No. Not 18.\n\nWait, perhaps the price is half the number of letters multiplied by something. 6 \u00d73=18.\n\nBut pineapple:9 letters \u00d73=27. Oh! That's consistent.\n\nGrape:5 letters \u00d73=15. Which matches.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be number of letters multiplied by 3.\n\nSo the price is (number of letters) \u00d73.\n\nSo orange:6\u00d73=18.\n\nPineapple:9\u00d73=27.\n\nGrape:5\u00d73=15.\n\nThen mango has 5 letters (M-A-N-G-O) \u21925\u00d73=15. So mango would cost $15, option B.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be syllables, but that didn't fit with grape. So the letter count approach seems to fit all given examples.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\n- Orange:6 letters \u21926\u00d73=18 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n- Pineapple:9 letters \u21929\u00d73=27 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n- Grape:5 letters \u21925\u00d73=15 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, mango has 5 letters \u21925\u00d73=15 \u2192B.\n\nWait, but wait, mango is spelled M-A-N-G-O, which is 5 letters. So yes, 5\u00d73=15. So the answer should be B)15.\n\nBut wait, wait another thing. Wait, I'm seeing that the prices for the given fruits are 18,27,15, which are all multiples of 9. 18=2\u00d79, 27=3\u00d79, 15=1.666\u2026 \u00d79. Wait, that's not exact.\n\nWait, 18 is 2\u00d79, 27 is 3\u00d79, 15 is 1.666\u00d79. Hmm, perhaps that's a different approach. Let me think.\n\nBut 15 is 5\u00d73, not 9. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the price is the number of letters multiplied by 3, as before. That seems more consistent.\n\nSo the conclusion is that mango costs $15, which is option B.\n",

So that's not it.\n\nPineapple:\n\nP (16) + I (9) + N (14) + E (5) + A (1) + P (16) + P (16) + L (12) + E (5).\n\nCalculating:16+9=25+14=39+5=44+1=45+16=61+16=77+12=89+5=94. 94, but the price is 27. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe another approach: the price is the number of consonants multiplied by something.\n\nOrange: consonants are R, N, G \u21923 consonants. 3 \u00d76=18. Pineapple: consonants are P, N, P, P, L \u21925 consonants. 5 \u00d75.4=27. Doesn't seem consistent.\n\nWait, 3\u00d76=18, 5\u00d75.4=27. That's not a whole number, so maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the price is based on the vowels' positions. Let me see.\n\nOrange's vowels are O (15), A (1), E (5). Sum:15+1+5=21. Not 18.\n\nPineapple's vowels: I (9), E (5), A (1), E (5). Sum:9+5+1+5=20. Not 27.\n\nHmm. Not matching.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe it's the number of vowels multiplied by the number of consonants. Orange: 3 vowels, 3 consonants (R, N, G). 3\u00d73=9. Not 18. Doesn't fit.\n\nPineapple: 4 vowels, 5 consonants. 4\u00d75=20. Not 27.\n\nNot matching.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the vowels multiplied by some other number. Let me think. Orange:3 vowels \u21923\u00d76=18. Pineapple:4\u00d76.75=27. Again, decimals, which might not make sense.\n\nHmm. Let me think differently. Maybe it's based on the fruit's name in another language, but that seems unlikely for a logic puzzle.\n\nWait, another angle: perhaps the price is determined by the number of segments in the fruit when written. Like, how many lines or strokes are in the letters. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think about the spelling. Maybe the price is the sum of the letters' positions in the word, but only considering certain letters.\n\nWait, another thought: the price of each fruit is the sum of the digits in the number of letters. For example, orange has 6 letters \u21926 \u21926\u00d73=18? Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the reverse: the number of letters is the sum of the price's digits. Orange: 18 \u21921+8=9. But orange has 6 letters. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the price is the sum of the vowels' positions. Let's try that.\n\nOrange: O (15), A (1), E (5) \u2192 sum 15+1+5=21. Not 18.\n\nHmm. Not matching.\n\nWait, maybe it's the product of the vowels' positions. O (15) \u00d7 A (1) \u00d7 E (5) \u219215\u00d71=15\u00d75=75. No, that's way too high.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the number of vowels times the number of letters.\n\nOrange:3 vowels \u00d76 letters=18. Yes! That works for orange.\n\nPineapple:4 vowels \u00d79 letters=36. But pineapple is 27. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So that doesn't work for pineapple.\n\nWait, maybe it's the number of vowels multiplied by something else. For orange: 3 vowels \u00d76=18. So 3\u00d76=18.\n\nPineapple:4 vowels \u00d7 (something) =27. 27/4 is 6.75. Not a whole number.\n\nHmm. Not matching.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the price is the square of the number of letters. Orange:6 letters \u21926^2=36. No. Not 18.\n\nWait, perhaps the price is half the number of letters multiplied by something. 6 \u00d73=18.\n\nBut pineapple:9 letters \u00d73=27. Oh! That's consistent.\n\nGrape:5 letters \u00d73=15. Which matches.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be number of letters multiplied by 3.\n\nSo the price is (number of letters) \u00d73.\n\nSo orange:6\u00d73=18.\n\nPineapple:9\u00d73=27.\n\nGrape:5\u00d73=15.\n\nThen mango has 5 letters (M-A-N-G-O) \u21925\u00d73=15. So mango would cost $15, option B.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be syllables, but that didn't fit with grape. So the letter count approach seems to fit all given examples.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\n- Orange:6 letters \u21926\u00d73=18 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n- Pineapple:9 letters \u21929\u00d73=27 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n- Grape:5 letters \u21925\u00d73=15 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, mango has 5 letters \u21925\u00d73=15 \u2192B.\n\nWait, but wait, mango is spelled M-A-N-G-O, which is 5 letters. So yes, 5\u00d73=15. So the answer should be B)15.\n\nBut wait, wait another thing. Wait, I'm seeing that the prices for the given fruits are 18,27,15, which are all multiples of 9. 18=2\u00d79, 27=3\u00d79, 15=1.666\u2026 \u00d79. Wait, that's not exact.\n\nWait, 18 is 2\u00d79, 27 is 3\u00d79, 15 is 1.666\u00d79. Hmm, perhaps that's a different approach. Let me think.\n\nBut 15 is 5\u00d73, not 9. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the price is the number of letters multiplied by 3, as before. That seems more consistent.\n\nSo the conclusion is that mango costs $15, which is option B.\n\n\nTo determine the price of a mango, we analyze the given prices of other fruits and identify a pattern. The prices are as follows:\n\n- Orange: $18  \n- Pineapple: $27  \n- Grape: $15  \n\nWe hypothesize that the price is based on the number of letters in the fruit's name multiplied by a constant factor. Let's test this:\n\n1. **Orange**: \"Orange\" has 6 letters. If we multiply the number of letters by 3, we get \\( 6 \\times 3 = 18 \\), which matches the given price.  \n2. **Pineapple**: \"Pineapple\" has 9 letters. Multiplying by 3 gives \\( 9 \\times 3 = 27 \\), which matches the given price.  \n3. **Grape**: \"Grape\" has 5 letters. Multiplying by 3 gives \\( 5 \\times 3 = 15 \\), which matches the given price.  \n\nThis pattern is consistent for all three fruits. Applying the same logic to \"mango\":  \n- \"Mango\" has 5 letters. Multiplying by 3 gives \\( 5 \\times 3 = 15 \\).  \n\nThus, the price of a mango is **$15**, corresponding to option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",
