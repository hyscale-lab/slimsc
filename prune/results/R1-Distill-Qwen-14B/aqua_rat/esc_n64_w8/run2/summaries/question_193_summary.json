      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe problem says: A two-digit number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. Also, the digit in the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place. I need to find what the number is, and the options are A)12, B)24, C)42, D)48, E)49.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. So it's a two-digit number. Let's represent it as 10*a + b, where a is the ten's digit and b is the unit's digit. Because, for example, 24 is 2*10 +4.\n\nThe problem states two things:\n\n1. The number is 18 more than the sum of its digits.\n2. The unit's digit is double the ten's digit.\n\nLet me write these as equations.\n\nFirst, the sum of the digits is a + b. The number itself is 10a + b. The number exceeds this sum by 18. So,\n\n10a + b = (a + b) + 18.\n\nThat's equation one.\n\nSecond, the unit's digit is double the ten's digit. So,\n\nb = 2a.\n\nThat's equation two.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1. 10a + b = a + b + 18\n2. b = 2a.\n\nHmm, let's substitute equation two into equation one to find a.\n\nSubstituting b=2a into equation 1:\n\n10a + (2a) = a + (2a) + 18.\n\nSimplify the left side: 10a +2a =12a.\n\nRight side: a + 2a =3a, so 3a +18.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n12a = 3a +18.\n\nSubtract 3a from both sides:\n\n9a =18.\n\nDivide both sides by 9:\n\na=2.\n\nSo the ten's digit is 2. Then, using equation two, b=2a=4.\n\nSo the number is 10a +b = 10*2 +4=24.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, B is 24. So that's one of the choices. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's check if 24 meets both conditions.\n\nFirst condition: the number exceeds the sum of the digits by 18.\n\nSum of digits: 2+4=6.\n\nNumber is 24. 24-6=18. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSecond condition: unit digit is double the ten's digit. 4 is 2*2. Yep.\n\nSo 24 seems correct. But let me look at the options again. Oh wait, option B is 24, but option D is 48. Hmm, wait, what if I made a mistake in the substitution.\n\nWait, let me double-check my equations.\n\nEquation 1: 10a +b = (a + b) +18.\n\nSimplify: 10a +b -a -b =18 \u21929a=18 \u2192 a=2. So that's correct.\n\nSo the number is 24. So why is 48 an option? Let me see if 48 also fits.\n\nWait, let's check 48.\n\nSum of digits:4+8=12.\n\n48-12=36. Which is more than 18. So 48 doesn't satisfy the first condition.\n\nWait, another possibility: Did I set up the equations correctly? Let me think. The number exceeds the sum by 18. So number = sum +18.\n\nYes, that's what I did.\n\nSo 24 is correct, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, another thought: are there any other numbers in the options that fit?\n\nLet's check the other options.\n\nOption A)12.\n\nDigits: 1 and 2. Sum=3. 12-3=9. Not 18. So no.\n\nOption C)42.\n\nDigits 4 and 2. Sum=6. 42-6=36. Not 18.\n\nOption D)48.\n\nDigits 4 and 8. Sum=12. 48-12=36. Not 18.\n\nOption E)49.\n\nDigits 4 and 9. Sum=13. 49-13=36. Still not 18.\n\nSo only 24 fits. So the answer should be B)24.\n",

I need to find which number among the options fits this.\n\nHmm, let's break it down. First, let me think about what a two-digit number represents. A two-digit number can be written as 10*a + b, where a is the digit in the ten's place and b is the digit in the unit's place. So for example, if the number is 34, a is 3 and b is 4.\n\nThe problem states that the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18.

The number is 10a + b, and the sum is a + b. The number is 18 more than this sum. So yes, 10a + b = (a + b) + 18.\n\nSimplifying that equation: 10a + b - a - b = 18.

So the digit in the ten's place is 2.\n\nBut wait, there's another condition: the digit at the unit's place is double the ten's digit. So, b = 2a. Since we found a is 2, then b would be 4. So the number should be 24, right? Let me check the options. Option B is 24.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Let me plug it back into the original conditions.\n\nFirst condition: the number exceeds the sum of digits by 18. 24 minus (2 +4) is 24 -6 = 18.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the problem says.\n\nThe problem is about a two-digit number. Hmm, two-digit numbers are from 10 to 99, right? So the number has a ten's place and a unit's place. Let me denote the ten's digit as 't' and the unit's digit as 'u'. So the actual number can be represented as 10*t + u. That makes sense because, for example, 23 is 2*10 +3.\n\nNow, the problem states two conditions. First, the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. So the number minus the sum of its digits equals 18. Let me write that down as an equation. \n\nThe sum of the digits is t + u. The number is 10t + u. So the equation is:\n\n10t + u - (t + u) = 18.\n\nSimplifying that, 10t + u - t - u equals 9t, so 9t = 18. Dividing both sides by 9 gives t = 2. Oh, so the ten's digit is 2. That's a good start.\n\nThe second condition is that the digit in the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place. So u = 2*t. Since we found t is 2, u should be 2*2 = 4. So the unit's digit is 4.\n\nPutting it all together, the two-digit number is 10*2 +4 =24. Let me check if that fits the first condition.\n\nThe number is 24. Sum of digits is 2+4=6. 24 -6 =18.

Let's see the options given: A is 12, B is24, C is42, D is48, E is49.\n\nIf I consider option C:42. Let's check the first condition. 42 - (4+2)=42-6=36. That's more than 18, so no. Option D:48. 48 - (4+8)=48-12=36, same as before. Option E:49. 49 -13=36 again. Option A:12. 12 -3=9, not 18. So no, only option B fits.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the problem says.\n\nThe problem is about a two-digit number. Hmm, two-digit numbers are from 10 to 99, right? So the number has a ten's place and a unit's place. Let me denote the ten's digit as 't' and the unit's digit as 'u'. So the actual number can be represented as 10*t + u. That makes sense because, for example, 23 is 2*10 +3.\n\nNow, the problem states two conditions. First, the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. So the number minus the sum of its digits equals 18. Let me write that down as an equation. \n\nThe sum of the digits is t + u. The number is 10t + u. So the equation is:\n\n10t + u - (t + u) = 18.\n\nSimplifying that, 10t + u - t - u equals 9t, so 9t = 18. Dividing both sides by 9 gives t = 2. Oh, so the ten's digit is 2. That's a good start.\n\nThe second condition is that the digit in the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place. So u = 2*t. Since we found t is 2, u should be 2*2 = 4. So the unit's digit is 4.\n\nPutting it all together, the two-digit number is 10*2 +4 =24. Let me check if that fits the first condition.\n\nThe number is 24. Sum of digits is 2+4=6. 24 -6 =18. Yep, that's correct. So the number is 24, which is option B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if any other options could fit. Let's see the options given: A is 12, B is24, C is42, D is48, E is49.\n\nIf I consider option C:42. Let's check the first condition. 42 - (4+2)=42-6=36. That's more than 18, so no. Option D:48. 48 - (4+8)=48-12=36, same as before. Option E:49. 49 -13=36 again. Option A:12. 12 -3=9, not 18. So no, only option B fits.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding a two-digit number that satisfies two conditions. Let the ten's digit be \\( t \\) and the unit's digit be \\( u \\).

Hmm, two-digit numbers are from 10 to 99, right? So the number has a ten's place and a unit's place.\n\nThe problem says the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. Wait, that's a bit tricky. Let me parse that. So, if the number is, say, AB (where A is the ten's digit and B is the unit's), then the number itself is 10*A + B. The sum of the digits is A + B. The number is 18 more than this sum. So the equation would be 10A + B = (A + B) + 18. Got it.\n\nThen, the problem states that the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place. So B = 2*A. That's another equation.\n\nSo I have two equations here:\n1. 10A + B = (A + B) + 18\n2. B = 2A\n\nLet me substitute the second equation into the first. So replacing B with 2A in the first equation:\n\n10A + 2A = (A + 2A) + 18\n\nSimplify both sides. Left side is 12A.

Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but what about another option? Let me think. Are there any other possibilities? Let's see. If A is 2, B is 4. That gives 24. If A were 3, B would be 6, making the number 36. Let's test that. Sum is 3+6=9. 9+18=27, which isn't 36. So 36 isn't a solution. If A=1, B=2. Number is 12. Sum is 3. 3+18=21, not 12. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the equations. Let me recheck.\n\nThe number is 10A + B. Sum is A+B. The number is (A+B) +18. So 10A+B = A+B +18 \u2192 10A = A +18 \u2192 9A=18 \u2192 A=2. Yes, that seems right.\n\nWait, but the option C is 42. Let's see. 42: A=4, B=2. B should be double A. 2 is not double of 4. So that doesn't fit. So C is out. D is 48. A=4, B=8. B is 8, which is double A (4*2=8). So that fits the second condition. Now, check the first condition. The number is 48. Sum is 4+8=12. 12+18=30. But 48 isn't 30. So 48 doesn't satisfy the first condition. So D is incorrect.\n\nE is 49. B is 9, which would require A=4.5, which isn't possible because digits are integers.

For example, if the number is 34, then a is 3 and b is 4.\n\nThe first condition says the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. So, the number itself minus the sum of its digits equals 18. Let's write that as an equation.\n\nSo, number = 10a + b\nSum of digits = a + b\nCondition: (10a + b) - (a + b) = 18\n\nSimplify that equation. Let's subtract the sums:\n\n10a + b - a - b = 18\nWhich simplifies to 9a = 18.\n\nWait, so 9a = 18. Solving for a, we divide both sides by 9:\n\na = 18 / 9\na = 2.\n\nSo the digit in the ten's place is 2. That's our first clue.\n\nThe second condition says the digit at the unit's place is double the ten's digit. So, b = 2a.\n\nSince we found a is 2, then b = 2*2 =4.\n\nSo the two-digit number is 10a + b = 10*2 +4 = 24.\n\nWait, but let me check the options given. The options are A)12, B)24, C)42, D)48, E)49.\n\nSo 24 is option B. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me plug the number back into the original problem to verify.\n\nFirst, check the sum of digits: 2 +4=6. The number is 24. So 24 -6=18. Yes, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, C is 42. Let me test that. 42's digits sum to 4+2=6. 42-6=36, which is not 18. So no.\n\nOption B is correct as per my calculation. But wait, I should double-check the equations.\n\nWait, another way to think: let's represent the two-digit number as 10a + b. The sum of digits is a + b. The number exceeds the sum by 18, so:\n\n10a + b = (a + b) + 18\nWhich simplifies to 10a + b = a + b + 18\nSubtract (a + b) from both sides: 9a =18 => a=2.\n\nAnd b is 2a=4. So number is 24, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options again, I see that option C is 42, which is 4 and 2. Let's see if that fits. If a=4 and b=2, then the sum of digits is 6. The number is 42. 42-6=36, which is not 18. So no, 42 doesn't fit.\n\nSo B is the correct answer.\n",

For example, if the number is 34, a is 3 and b is 4, so 10*3 +4 =34.\n\nThe first condition is that the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. So, the number minus (a + b) equals 18. Let me write that as an equation: (10a + b) - (a + b) = 18.\n\nLet me simplify that equation. (10a + b) minus (a + b) is 10a + b -a -b. The b's cancel out, so 9a = 18. Oh, that's a nice simple equation. So, 9a =18. Dividing both sides by 9, a=2. So the ten's digit is 2.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I did that correctly. So, the number is 10a + b. Sum of digits is a + b. The number exceeds the sum by 18, so (10a + b) - (a + b) =18. Yeah, that's correct. So 9a=18 \u2192 a=2. So the ten's digit is 2.\n\nNow the second condition: the digit at the unit's place is double the ten's digit. So, b = 2a. Since a is 2, b=4.\n\nSo the number should be 10a + b = 10*2 +4= 24.

Sum is 4+2=6. 42-6=36 again, which is not 18. So no. Option E is 49: sum is 4+9=13, 49-13=36 again. So not matching.\n\nOption A is 12: sum is 1+2=3. 12-3=9, which is less than 18. So no.\n\nSo yes, the only one that fits is B, 24.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Did I interpret the problem correctly? The problem says the two-digit number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18.

So N = 10a + b.\n\nCondition 1: N - (a + b) =18.\n\nCondition 2: b=2a.\n\nSo substituting condition 2 into condition1: 10a + 2a - (a + 2a) =18 \u2192 12a -3a=18 \u21929a=18 \u2192a=2.\n\nSo that's correct.

Alright, let me break it down.\n\nThe problem says that a two-digit number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. Oh right, so if the number is, say, AB (where A is the tens digit and B is the units digit), then the actual number is 10*A + B. The sum of its digits is A + B. So the number is 18 more than this sum. So the equation would be 10A + B = (A + B) + 18. Let me write that down.\n\nSo 10A + B = A + B + 18. Hmm, wait, if I subtract A + B from both sides, I get 9A = 18. Because 10A minus A is 9A, and B minus B is zero. So 9A equals 18. Then A would be 2, right? Because 18 divided by 9 is 2. So the tens digit is 2.\n\nWait, but there's another condition. The digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place. So B is twice A. Since A is 2, B should be 4. So the number is 24. Let me check the options. Option B is 24. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSo, number is 10A + B. Sum of digits is A + B. The number exceeds the sum by 18, so 10A + B = (A + B) + 18. Subtracting (A + B) from both sides gives 9A = 18. So A is 2. Then B is 2*2=4. So the number is 24. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let me look at the options again. Option C is 42, which is also a number where the unit digit is double the ten's digit. Wait, no. Because in 42, the ten's digit is 4 and the unit is 2. Wait, that's not double. Oh no, wait, no. Wait, 2 is half of 4. So the condition says unit's place is double ten's, so B=2*A. So if the number is 42, then A is 4, B is 2. Then B would be 2, which is not double of 4. So 42 wouldn't fit the second condition. So that's why 24 is correct.\n\nBut wait, let me plug in 24 into the first condition. The number is 24. Sum of digits is 2+4=6. 24 - 6 = 18. Yes, that works. So that's correct.\n\nAnother way, let's see the other options. Option C is 42. Let's test it. 42 - (4+2)=42-6=36. That's way more than 18. So no, 42 doesn't fit. Option D is 48. 4+8=12. 48-12=36 again, not 18. So no. Option E is 49: 4+9=13. 49-13=36 again. No. Option A is 12: 1+2=3. 12-3=9, which is not 18.

Hmm, wait, if I subtract A + B from both sides, I get 9A = 18. Because 10A minus A is 9A, and B minus B is zero. So 9A equals 18. Then A would be 2, right? Because 18 divided by 9 is 2. So the tens digit is 2.\n\nWait, but there's another condition. The digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place. So B is twice A. Since A is 2, B should be 4. So the number is 24. Let me check the options. Option B is 24. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSo, number is 10A + B. Sum of digits is A + B. The number exceeds the sum by 18, so 10A + B = (A + B) + 18. Subtracting (A + B) from both sides gives 9A = 18. So A is 2. Then B is 2*2=4. So the number is 24. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let me look at the options again. Option C is 42, which is also a number where the unit digit is double the ten's digit. Wait, no. Because in 42, the ten's digit is 4 and the unit is 2. Wait, that's not double. Oh no, wait, no. Wait, 2 is half of 4. So the condition says unit's place is double ten's, so B=2*A. So if the number is 42, then A is 4, B is 2. Then B would be 2, which is not double of 4. So 42 wouldn't fit the second condition. So that's why 24 is correct.\n\nBut wait, let me plug in 24 into the first condition. The number is 24. Sum of digits is 2+4=6. 24 - 6 = 18. Yes, that works. So that's correct.\n\nAnother way, let's see the other options. Option C is 42. Let's test it. 42 - (4+2)=42-6=36. That's way more than 18. So no, 42 doesn't fit. Option D is 48. 4+8=12. 48-12=36 again, not 18. So no. Option E is 49: 4+9=13. 49-13=36 again. No. Option A is 12: 1+2=3. 12-3=9, which is not 18. So only 24 fits both conditions.\n\nSo the correct answer must be option B) 24.\n\n\nThe problem involves a two-digit number where the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18, and the unit's digit is double the ten's digit. Let the ten's digit be \\( A \\) and the unit's digit be \\( B \\). The number can be expressed as \\( 10A + B \\), and the sum of its digits is \\( A + B \\). According to the problem, the number is 18 more than the sum of its digits, leading to the equation:\n\n\\[\n10A + B = (A + B) + 18\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this, we find:\n\n\\[\n9A = 18 \\implies A = 2\n\\]\n\nThe second condition states that the unit's digit is double the ten's digit, so:\n\n\\[\nB = 2A = 2 \\times 2 = 4\n\\]\n\nThus, the number is \\( 10A + B = 10 \\times 2 + 4 = 24 \\). Verifying, the sum of the digits is \\( 2 + 4 = 6 \\), and \\( 24 - 6 = 18 \\), which satisfies the first condition. Checking the other options, none of them meet both conditions. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: B",
