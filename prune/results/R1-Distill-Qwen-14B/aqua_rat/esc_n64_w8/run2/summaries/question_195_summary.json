      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem where three bells are ringing at different intervals, and I need to find out when they'll all ring together again. Let's see. The intervals are 36 seconds, 40 seconds, and 48 seconds. Hmm, I remember that when things happen at regular intervals, the time they all coincide again is the least common multiple, or LCM, of their intervals. Right, so I need to find the LCM of 36, 40, and 48.\n\nWait, how do I calculate the LCM again? Oh right, you break each number down into its prime factors. So let's factor each one.\n\nStarting with 36. 36 divided by 2 is 18, then divided by 2 again is 9. 9 is 3 squared, so 3 times 3. So 36 is 2^2 * 3^2.\n\nNext, 40. 40 divided by 2 is 20, then 10, then 5. So that's 2^3 * 5^1.\n\nAnd 48. 48 divided by 2 is 24, then 12, then 6, then 3. So that's 2^4 * 3^1.\n\nNow, the LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes present. So for 2, the highest power is 2^4 from 48. For 3, it's 3^2 from 36. And for 5, it's 5^1 from 40.\n\nSo LCM = 2^4 * 3^2 *5^1. Let's compute that.\n\n2^4 is 16. 3^2 is 9. 16 times 9 is 144. Then 144 times 5 is 720. So the LCM is 720 seconds.\n\nWait, the options are in minutes. So 720 seconds divided by 60 is 12 minutes. So the bells ring together after 12 minutes.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 12 minutes. So the correct answer should be B.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Did I calculate the LCM correctly? Let me go through the factors again.\n\n36: 2^2, 3^2. 40: 2^3,5. 48:2^4,3. So LCM is 2^4 (since 48 has the highest power of 2), 3^2 (36 has higher power), and 5^1. So yes, 16 *9=144, 144 *5=720. 720 seconds is 12 minutes. So yeah, B is correct.\n",

Let me think about how to apply that here.\n\nThe intervals given are 36 seconds, 40 seconds, and 48 seconds. So I need to find the LCM of these three numbers. Wait, how do I calculate the LCM again? Oh right, I think I should factor each number into its prime factors and then take the highest power of each prime that appears.\n\nLet me break down each number:\n\n36 seconds: Let's see, 36 divided by 2 is 18, then divided by 2 again is 9. 9 is 3 squared. So 36 is 2^2 * 3^2.\n\n40 seconds: 40 divided by 2 is 20, again by 2 is 10, then by 2 again is 5. So 40 is 2^3 * 5^1.\n\n48 seconds: 48 divided by 2 is 24, again by 2 is 12, again by 2 is 6, again by 2 is 3.

So the LCM is 720 seconds.\n\nWait, the question is asking how long after they start ringing together will they all ring again. So 720 seconds. Let me convert that into minutes because the options are in minutes. 60 seconds are in a minute, so 720 divided by 60 is 12 minutes.

So the first time they all ring together again is when the time elapsed is the smallest number that is a multiple of all three intervals. Oh right, that's the definition of LCM.\n\nSo I need to calculate the LCM of 36, 40, and 48. Let me break this down. I'll start by finding the prime factors of each number.\n\n36: Let's see, 36 divided by 2 is 18, again by 2 is 9. Then 9 is 3 times 3. So 36 is 2\u00b2 * 3\u00b2.\n\n40: Divided by 2 is 20, again by 2 is 10, then by 2 again is 5. So 40 is 2\u00b3 * 5\u00b9.\n\n48: Divided by 2 is 24, again by 2 is 12, again by 2 is 6, and again by 2 is 3. So 48 is 2^4 * 3\u00b9.\n\nNow, to find the LCM, I take the highest power of each prime number present in the factorizations. So for 2, the highest power is 2^4 (from 48), for 3 it's 3^2 (from 36), and for 5 it's 5^1 (from 40).\n\nSo the LCM would be 2^4 * 3^2 *5^1. Let me calculate that.\n\n2^4 is 16. 3^2 is 9. 5^1 is 5. Multiply them together: 16 *9 is 144, then 144 *5 is 720.\n\nSo the LCM is 720 seconds. Now, I need to convert that into minutes because the options are in minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 720 divided by 60 is 12 minutes.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 12 minutes. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Did I compute the LCM correctly? 36 is 2\u00b2*3\u00b2, 40 is 2\u00b3*5, 48 is 2^4*3. So the LCM is indeed 2^4, 3^2, 5. So 16*9=144, 144*5=720. Yes, that's right. 720 seconds is 12 minutes. So yes, option B is correct.\n",
