Let me read it again and try to figure it out step by step. \n\nThe problem says: \"30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to its one third. What is the value of 50% of that number?\" And then there are five options to choose from.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. So there's a number, let's call it 'x' for now. When we subtract 30 from this number, the result is one third of the original number. So mathematically, that should be something like x minus 30 equals one third of x. \n\nWait, let me write that out. So the equation would be:\n\nx - 30 = (1/3)x\n\nOkay, now I need to solve for x. Let's rearrange this equation. Subtract (1/3)x from both sides to get all x terms on one side.\n\nx - (1/3)x - 30 = 0\n\nWait, wait. Let me do it step by step. Subtract (1/3)x from both sides:\n\nx - (1/3)x = 30\n\nHmm, combining like terms. x is the same as (3/3)x, right? So (3/3)x minus (1/3)x is (2/3)x.\n\nSo now we have (2/3)x = 30.\n\nTo find x, we can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of (2/3), which is (3/2).\n\nx = 30 * (3/2)\n\nCalculating that, 30 times 3 is 90, divided by 2 is 45. So x is 45.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for 50% of that number. 50% is the same as half. So 50% of 45 is 45 divided by 2, which is 22.5.\n\nWait, looking at the options, option A is 22.5. So that should be the answer.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's plug x=45 back into the original problem.\n\nSubtracting 30 from 45 gives 15. Is 15 equal to one third of 45? Let's see: 45 divided by 3 is 15. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo 50% of 45 is indeed 22.5. So option A is the correct one.\n",

When we subtract 30 from x, the result is one third of the original number. Oh wait, wait. Wait, the way it's phrased is a bit tricky. Let me make sure I understand correctly.\n\nThe problem says subtracting 30 reduces the number to one third. So, x minus 30 equals (1/3) of x? Or does it mean that subtracting 30 from x reduces it to one third of something else? No, I think the first interpretation is correct. So, the equation would be x - 30 = (1/3)x.\n\nWait, but wait another second. Let me think. When they say it's reduced to its one third, that means the result after subtracting 30 is a third of the original number. So yes, x - 30 = (1/3)x.\n\nSo, let's write that equation down: x - 30 = (1/3)x.\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. Let's subtract (1/3)x from both sides to get all the x terms on one side.

Then, adding 30 to both sides gives (2/3)x = 30.\n\nTo solve for x, I can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of (2/3), which is (3/2). So, x = 30 * (3/2). Let me calculate that: 30 divided by 2 is 15, multiplied by 3 is 45. So, x is 45.\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right. Because if x is 45, then subtracting 30 gives 15, which is a third of 45.

So,\n\n(2/3)x - 30 = 0\n\nNow, I can add 30 to both sides:\n\n(2/3)x = 30\n\nTo find x, I need to multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 2/3, which is 3/2.\n\nx = 30 * (3/2)\n\nLet me compute that. 30 divided by 2 is 15, and 15 times 3 is 45. So x equals 45.\n\nWait, but the question isn't asking for x. It's asking for 50% of that number. Oh right, so 50% is the same as half. So I need to find half of 45.\n\nHalf of 45 is 22.5. Let me think, but wait, looking at the options, option A is 22.5. But wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps because 22.5 seems a bit low. Let me go through the problem again.\n\nThe original equation: x - 30 = x/3.\n\nMultiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction. That might be a better approach.\n\n3*(x - 30) = x\n\nWhich gives 3x - 90 = x.\n\nSubtract x from both sides: 2x - 90 = 0.\n\nAdd 90 to both sides: 2x = 90.\n\nDivide by 2: x = 45.\n\nOkay, that's the same result as before. So x is 45. Then 50% of 45 is 22.5, which is option A.\n\nWait a second, but looking at the options again: A is 22.5, B is 84, C is 21, D is 24, E is 25. So 22.5 is an option. But wait, the problem says \"50% of that number\"\u2014so that's correct.\n\nHmm, but I'm a bit confused because when I subtract 30 from 45, I get 15, which is indeed one third of 45. So yes, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, the options include 84, which is much higher. Did I make a mistake in the setup?\n\nLet me read the problem again. \"30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to its one third.\" So, the number minus 30 is equal to one third of the number. That's how I set it up.\n\nSo x -30 = x/3, leading to x=45. 50% of 45 is 22.5, which is option A. So why is option B 84? Did I miscalculate something?\n\nWait, wait a minute. Maybe I misinterpreted the problem. Let me read it again.\n\n\"30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to its one third.\"\n\nHmm, does it mean that when 30 is subtracted, the number is reduced to a third of what it was. So, the new number is one third of the original. So x -30 = (1/3)x.\n\nYes, that's what I did. So that's correct. So the answer should be 22.5, which is option A. But I feel like 22.5 is not one of the more common options. Let me check the math again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about it differently. What if the problem is phrased as 30 is subtracted from a number, making it a third of the original. So, x -30 = (1/3)x.\n\nWait, yes. So, x = 45, as before. So 50% is 22.5.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the problem is phrased as subtracting 30 from the number reduces it to one third. So, the number after subtraction is one third, so x -30 = (1/3)x.\n\nThat's correct. So the calculation is correct.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the problem is that 30 is subtracted from the number, and the result is one third of the number. So, x-30 = (1/3) x. Which again gives x=45.\n\nSo 50% of x is 22.5, which is option A.\n\nBut looking at the options, option B is 84. Could I have misread the problem? Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says that when 30 is subtracted, the number is reduced to one third of its original value. So, maybe the subtraction leads to a third of the original, so x -30 = (1/3) x. Which leads to x=45.\n\nWait, but if I did something wrong, maybe the equation is x -30 = (x) - (1/3 x). No, that doesn't make sense. The way it's phrased, the number after subtraction is one third of the original.\n\nSo I think my approach is correct. So the answer is 22.5, option A.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose the problem was phrased as the number is reduced by one third when 30 is subtracted. That would imply x - (x/3) =30. So, 2x/3=30, which would give x=45 again. So same result.\n\nSo, yes, 50% of 45 is 22.5. So the correct answer is A.\n",

Wait, maybe it's better to get all the x terms on one side. So, x - (1/3)x equals 30. Because if I add 30 to both sides, it would be x - (1/3)x = 30.\n\nWhat's x minus (1/3)x? That's the same as (2/3)x. So, (2/3)x = 30. To find x, I can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 2/3, which is 3/2. So, x = 30 * (3/2).\n\nCalculating that: 30 times 3 is 90, divided by 2 is 45. So x is 45. \n\nWait, but the question is asking for 50% of that number. So 50% is the same as half. So 45 divided by 2 is 22.5. So the answer should be 22.5. Looking at the options, option A is 22.5. So the correct answer would be A.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my equations because sometimes I might have misread the problem. The problem says subtracting 30 reduces the number to one third. So x -30 is (1/3)x. Yes, that's what I did. So the calculation seems correct.\n\nAnother way to check: if x is 45, subtracting 30 gives 15. And 15 is indeed a third of 45. So that's correct. Then 50% of 45 is 22.5. Yep, that matches option A.\n\n\nLet the number be \\( x \\). According to the problem, subtracting 30 from \\( x \\) reduces it to one third of the original number. This can be written as:\n\n\\[\nx - 30 = \\frac{1}{3}x\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), subtract \\( \\frac{1}{3}x \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\nx - \\frac{1}{3}x = 30\n\\]\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3}x = 30\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\) to isolate \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = 30 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 45\n\\]\n\nThe problem asks for 50% of this number. Since 50% is equivalent to half, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{45}{2} = 22.5\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of 50% of the number is 22.5, which corresponds to option A.\n\nAnswer: A",

I'm going to try to translate the words into an equation because that's usually the way to approach word problems.\n\nSo the problem says, when 30 is subtracted from a number, it becomes one third of what it was originally. Let me represent the unknown number as x. So the number is x. If I subtract 30 from x, the result is x minus 30. And this result is equal to one third of the original number. So, putting that into an equation: x - 30 = (1/3)x.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Let me write that down:\n\nx - 30 = (1/3)x.\n\nNow I need to solve for x. Let's rearrange this equation. I'll subtract (1/3)x from both sides to get all the x terms on one side.\n\nx - (1/3)x - 30 = 0.\n\nWait, actually, maybe a better approach is to bring the (1/3)x to the left and the 30 to the right. Alternatively, I can subtract (1/3)x from both sides. Let me do that:\n\nx - (1/3)x = 30.\n\nHmm, okay. So x minus one third of x is equal to 30. Let's compute x - (1/3)x. That's the same as (2/3)x because 1x minus 1/3x is 2/3x.\n\nSo (2/3)x = 30.\n\nNow, to find x, I can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 2/3, which is 3/2.\n\nx = 30 * (3/2).\n\nLet me compute that: 30 divided by 2 is 15, multiplied by 3 is 45. So x is 45.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me double-check that math. 30 times 3 is 90, divided by 2 is 45. Yeah, that's correct.

Because one third of 45 is 15. Yes, that checks out.\n\nSo 50% of 45 is indeed 22.5. So the correct answer should be A)22.5.\n\nBut wait, the options include B)84, which is much higher. Did I make a mistake in my calculations?\n\nWait, let me recheck the equation setup. The problem says subtracting 30 reduces the number to one third. So x -30 = (1/3)x. That's correct. Solving that gives x=45. So 50% is 22.5, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, another thought: maybe I misread the problem. Let me read it again. \"30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to its one third.\" So the number after subtracting 30 is one third of the original. So yes, x-30= (1/3)x. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, so the answer should be A)22.5. But wait, why is option B)84 an option? Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the equation setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the number is reduced to one third when 30 is subtracted. So maybe the equation is x -30 = (1/3)(x -30). No, that's not the case because the problem states that after subtracting 30, the number is reduced to one third of its original value, not one third of the reduced value.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point. Let me make sure. The problem says when 30 is subtracted, it's reduced to one third. So the new value (x-30) is one third of the original value (x). So x-30 = (1/3)x. So that's correct.\n\nSo the calculations are correct. So the answer should be 22.5, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check again. Let me plug x=45 into the original problem. 45 minus 30 is 15. Is 15 equal to one third of 45? Yes, because 45 divided by 3 is 15. So that's correct. Then 50% of 45 is 22.5. So the answer is A.\n\nBut wait, the options don't have A as the most common answer. Let me think if perhaps I've misread the problem. Maybe it's subtracting 30 reduces the number to one third of the reduced number? No, that can't be because the wording is that it is reduced to its one third, meaning one third of the original.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the number after subtraction is one third of the remaining number, which would change the equation. But that's not what the problem states. It says \"reduced to its one third,\" which implies one third of the original.\n\nSo I think my initial approach is correct. So the answer is 22.5, option A.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, the correct answer is not A, but perhaps I made a mistake in the equation. Let me think differently. Suppose the number is x. Subtracting 30 makes it one third of the original. So x-30 = (1/3)x. So solving: x - (1/3)x =30. (2/3)x=30. x=30*(3/2)=45.\n\nYes, correct. So 50% of 45 is 22.5. So the answer is A.\n",
