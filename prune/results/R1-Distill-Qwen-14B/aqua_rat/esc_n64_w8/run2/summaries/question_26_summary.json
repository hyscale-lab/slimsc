      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a retailer selling an appliance. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says the retailer sold the appliance for 40 percent above cost, and that represented a gross profit of $20.00. I need to find out the selling price.\n\nWait, let's break this down. Gross profit is the amount the retailer made after subtracting the cost from the selling price. So, if the profit is $20, that's the difference between what they sold it for and what it cost them.\n\nBut wait, the problem also says they sold it for 40 percent above cost. So the selling price is 40% higher than the cost. Let me denote the cost as C. So the selling price S would be C plus 40% of C, which is S = C + 0.4C = 1.4C.\n\nBut the gross profit is the selling price minus cost. So profit = S - C = 1.4C - C = 0.4C. Oh, wait! The problem states that this profit is $20. So 0.4C = $20.\n\nSo I can solve for C. Let me do that. 0.4C = 20 \u2192 C = 20 / 0.4. Let me calculate that. 20 divided by 0.4 is the same as 20 * (10/4) = 20 * 2.5 = 50. So the cost C is $50.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the selling price, which is 1.4 times the cost. So S = 1.4 * 50. Let me compute that. 50 * 1.4 is 70. So the selling price should be $70. Looking at the options, option D is $70.00.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps. Profit is S - C, which is 40% of C, which is 0.4C. And 0.4C = 20, so C is 50. Then S is 1.4*50=70. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think in terms of equations. Let me write that:\n\nLet C = cost price.\n\nSelling price S = C + 0.4C = 1.4C.\n\nProfit = S - C = 0.4C = $20.\n\nSo 0.4C = 20 \u2192 C = 20 / 0.4 = 50.\n\nThen S = 1.4 * 50 = 70.\n\nSo the answer should be D) $70.00.\n",

The question says that the retailer sold it for 40 percent above cost, which is a gross profit of $20.00. And I need to find out what price the retailer sold it for. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me try to break down the problem. I know that when a retailer sells something, their selling price is based on their cost plus some profit. Here, the profit is given as $20, and this profit is 40% of the cost. Wait, wait, no, the question says the selling price is 40% above cost, which means the selling price is cost plus 40% of cost. So, the selling price (SP) is cost (C) plus 40% of C. Alternatively, SP = C + 0.4*C = 1.4*C.\n\nBut wait, the problem also mentions that the gross profit is $20. Gross profit is calculated as selling price minus cost. So, profit = SP - C. So, in this case, profit is $20, which equals SP - C.\n\nBut I also have SP = 1.4*C. So substituting that into the profit equation: 1.4*C - C = 20. Let's compute that. 1.4C minus C is 0.4C, so 0.4C = 20. So, to find C, I can divide both sides by 0.4. C = 20 / 0.4.\n\nLet me do that math. 20 divided by 0.4 is the same as 20 * (10/4), which is 20 * 2.5, because 0.4 is 2/5, so reciprocal is 5/2. So 20 * 5/2 is 50. Wait, no, wait. 20 / 0.4 equals 50? Let me check: 0.4 times 50 is 20. Yes, right. So the cost is $50.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I got the percentages right. Because sometimes people get confused between percentage markup and percentage profit. The question says the selling price is 40% above cost, which is a markup. So the selling price is 140% of the cost, which is what I thought. So the profit is 40% of cost, which is $20. So that leads to cost being $50.\n\nThen the selling price is 1.4 times cost. So 1.4 * 50 equals 70. So the selling price is $70. Let me check the options. The options are A)27.30, B)51, C)63, D)70, E)91. So D is 70. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Let's recalculate.\n\nIf the cost is $50, and the selling price is 40% above cost, then SP = 50 + (0.4 *50) = 50 +20 =70. So yes, that's correct. So the selling price is $70, which is option D.\n\nAnother way to think about it: profit is $20. The profit is 40% of cost. So 40% of cost is $20. So cost is 20 /0.4=50. Then, the selling price is cost plus profit, which is 50+20=70. Same result.\n\nAlternatively, if I think in terms of equations:\n\nLet C be the cost price.\n\nSP = C + 0.4C =1.4C.\n\nProfit = SP - C =0.4C =20.\n\nSo 0.4C =20 \u2192 C=50.\n\nSo SP is 1.4 *50=70.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm a bit new to this kind of stuff, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see, the question is about a retailer selling an appliance for 40% above cost, which gives a gross profit of $20.00. I need to find out the selling price. Hmm, right.\n\nWait, let me make sure I understand the terms. Gross profit is the amount you make after subtracting the cost from the selling price. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, profit is calculated based on the cost, I think. Or is it based on the selling price? Hmm. Let me think.\n\nSo, the problem says the retailer sold it for 40% above cost. So the selling price is 40% higher than the cost. So if the cost is C, then the selling price is C plus 40% of C, which is 1.4 times C. Got that part.\n\nAnd the gross profit is given as $20.00. So gross profit is the amount made after covering the cost. So profit equals selling price minus cost. That makes sense. So profit is SP - C.\n\nPutting that together, the profit is $20. So SP - C = $20. But SP is 1.4C. So substituting that in, 1.4C - C = $20.\n\nWait, 1.4C minus C is 0.4C. So 0.4C = 20. So C is 20 divided by 0.4. Let me calculate that. 20 / 0.4 is the same as 20 * (10/4) = 20 * 2.5 = 50. So the cost is $50.\n\nWait, but wait. The question is asking for the selling price. So SP is 1.4 times C, which is 1.4 * 50. Let me compute that. 50 * 1.4 is 70. So the selling price is $70. Let me check the options. Option D is $70. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but wait. Another way to think about this. Let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Because sometimes profit is calculated on cost, sometimes on selling price. But in this problem, the 40% is above cost, which affects the selling price directly. So the 40% is on cost, not on selling price. So the profit is 40% of cost, which is $20. Because SP is 140% of cost, so the profit is 40% of cost, which is 0.4C = 20. So that's correct. So C is 50, SP is 70. So yes, D is the answer.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm a bit new to this kind of stuff, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see, the question is about a retailer selling an appliance for 40% above cost, which gives a gross profit of $20.00. I need to find out the selling price. Hmm, right.\n\nWait, let me make sure I understand the terms. Gross profit is the amount you make after subtracting the cost from the selling price. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, profit is calculated based on the cost, I think. Or is it based on the selling price? Hmm. Let me think.\n\nSo, the problem says the retailer sold it for 40% above cost. So the selling price is 40% higher than the cost. So if the cost is C, then the selling price is C plus 40% of C, which is 1.4 times C. Got that part.\n\nAnd the gross profit is given as $20.00. So gross profit is the amount made after covering the cost. So profit equals selling price minus cost. That makes sense. So profit is SP - C.\n\nPutting that together, the profit is $20. So SP - C = $20. But SP is 1.4C. So substituting that in, 1.4C - C = $20.\n\nWait, 1.4C minus C is 0.4C. So 0.4C = 20. So C is 20 divided by 0.4. Let me calculate that. 20 / 0.4 is the same as 20 * (10/4) = 20 * 2.5 = 50. So the cost is $50.\n\nWait, but wait. The question is asking for the selling price. So SP is 1.4 times C, which is 1.4 * 50. Let me compute that. 50 * 1.4 is 70. So the selling price is $70. Let me check the options. Option D is $70. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but wait. Another way to think about this. Let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Because sometimes profit is calculated on cost, sometimes on selling price. But in this problem, the 40% is above cost, which affects the selling price directly. So the 40% is on cost, not on selling price. So the profit is 40% of cost, which is $20. Because SP is 140% of cost, so the profit is 40% of cost, which is 0.4C = 20. So that's correct. So C is 50, SP is 70. So yes, D is the answer.\n\n\nThe problem states that the retailer sold an appliance for 40% above its cost, resulting in a gross profit of $20.00. To find the selling price, we start by defining the cost as \\( C \\). The selling price (\\( SP \\)) is 40% above the cost, so \\( SP = 1.4C \\). The gross profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost, which is given as $20.00. Therefore:\n\n\\[\nSP - C = 20\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( SP = 1.4C \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[\n1.4C - C = 20\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n0.4C = 20\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( C \\):\n\n\\[\nC = \\frac{20}{0.4} = 50\n\\]\n\nThe cost is $50. The selling price is then:\n\n\\[\nSP = 1.4C = 1.4 \\times 50 = 70\n\\]\n\nThus, the selling price is $70. Among the options provided, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: D**",

Hmm, I need to find out what the selling price was.\n\nWait, let me make sure I understand the terms. Gross profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price, right?

Hmm, wait, I need to make sure I understand what each part means.\n\nSo, when they say \"40 percent above cost,\" that probably means the selling price is 40% higher than the cost price.

Hmm, the problem says the retailer sold the appliance for 40 percent above cost, and that represented a gross profit of $20.00. I need to find out what price the retailer sold it for.\n\nWait, let's break this down. So the selling price is 40% above the cost. That means if the cost is, say, C dollars, the selling price S is C plus 40% of C. Or in other words, S = C + 0.4C, which simplifies to S = 1.4C. Right?\n\nBut wait, the problem also mentions that this 40% above cost is a gross profit of $20.00. Oh, wait, no, I think I might have gotten that wrong. Let me think again. Gross profit is the amount you make after subtracting the cost. So the gross profit is selling price minus cost. Oh, right, so if the selling price is 40% above the cost, the profit is 40% of the cost, which equals $20.\n\nWait, let me clarify. So the selling price is 140% of the cost (which is 100% + 40%). So, S = 1.4 * C. And the gross profit is S - C. So, S - C = 0.4 * C. And that's equal to $20. So 0.4 * C = 20.\n\nOh, so I can solve for C. Let's do that. 0.4C = 20. So, C = 20 / 0.4. Let me calculate that. 20 divided by 0.4 is the same as 20 multiplied by 2.5, because 1/0.4 is 2.5. So 20 * 2.5 = 50. So the cost is $50.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the selling price, which is 1.4 times the cost. So S = 1.4 * 50. Let me calculate that. 50 times 1.4 is 70. So the selling price is $70.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is $70. So that must be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Sometimes, percentage problems can be tricky. Another way to think about it: if the selling price is 40% above cost, that's a 40% markup on cost. So the markup is $20, which is 40% of the cost. So yes, cost is $50, selling price is $70. So yeah, the answer should be D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a retailer selling an appliance. Let me try to understand what's going on. Hmm, the problem says the retailer sold the appliance for 40 percent above cost, and that represented a gross profit of $20.00. I need to find out what price the retailer sold it for.\n\nWait, let's break this down. So the selling price is 40% above the cost. That means if the cost is, say, C dollars, the selling price S is C plus 40% of C. Or in other words, S = C + 0.4C, which simplifies to S = 1.4C. Right?\n\nBut wait, the problem also mentions that this 40% above cost is a gross profit of $20.00. Oh, wait, no, I think I might have gotten that wrong. Let me think again. Gross profit is the amount you make after subtracting the cost. So the gross profit is selling price minus cost. Oh, right, so if the selling price is 40% above the cost, the profit is 40% of the cost, which equals $20.\n\nWait, let me clarify. So the selling price is 140% of the cost (which is 100% + 40%). So, S = 1.4 * C. And the gross profit is S - C. So, S - C = 0.4 * C. And that's equal to $20. So 0.4 * C = 20.\n\nOh, so I can solve for C. Let's do that. 0.4C = 20. So, C = 20 / 0.4. Let me calculate that. 20 divided by 0.4 is the same as 20 multiplied by 2.5, because 1/0.4 is 2.5. So 20 * 2.5 = 50. So the cost is $50.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the selling price, which is 1.4 times the cost. So S = 1.4 * 50. Let me calculate that. 50 times 1.4 is 70. So the selling price is $70.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is $70. So that must be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Sometimes, percentage problems can be tricky. Another way to think about it: if the selling price is 40% above cost, that's a 40% markup on cost. So the markup is $20, which is 40% of the cost. So yes, cost is $50, selling price is $70. So yeah, the answer should be D.\n\n\nThe problem states that the retailer sold an appliance for 40% above its cost, resulting in a gross profit of $20.00. To find the selling price, we start by defining the cost as \\( C \\). The selling price \\( S \\) is 40% above the cost, so \\( S = 1.4C \\). The gross profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost, which is \\( S - C = 0.4C \\). This profit is given as $20, so:\n\n\\[\n0.4C = 20\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( C \\), we divide both sides by 0.4:\n\n\\[\nC = \\frac{20}{0.4} = 50\n\\]\n\nNow, the selling price is \\( S = 1.4C \\). Substituting \\( C = 50 \\):\n\n\\[\nS = 1.4 \\times 50 = 70\n\\]\n\nThus, the retailer sold the appliance for $70.00. Among the options provided, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: D**",
