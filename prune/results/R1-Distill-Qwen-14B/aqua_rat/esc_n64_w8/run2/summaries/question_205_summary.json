      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I've got this problem about a liquid passing through a drain, and I need to find out how many minutes it takes for y gallons to pass through. Hmm, okay, let me break it down step by step.\n\nSo the problem says the liquid passes at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. I think I should start by figuring out the rate per second and then convert that into minutes. Oh wait, or maybe find how much time it takes per gallon and then scale it up to y gallons. Let's think.\n\nThe rate is given as (w/25) gallons every x seconds. So that's the rate. Let me write that down. Rate = (w/25) / x. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, because the rate is in gallons per x seconds. So it's (w/25) gallons per x seconds. So in terms of gallons per second, that would be (w/25) divided by x, right? So rate r = (w)/(25x) gallons per second.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of time per gallon. Because the question is about time taken for y gallons. So if the drain lets through w/25 gallons every x seconds, then for one gallon, how much time does it take?\n\nSo, if x seconds gives w/25 gallons, then one gallon would take x / (w/25) seconds. Because you're inversely proportional. So time per gallon is (x) * (25/w) seconds. So time per gallon is (25x)/w seconds.\n\nBut wait, let me check that. Suppose x is 25 seconds and w is 100. Then w/25 is 4 gallons every 25 seconds. So each gallon takes 25/4 = 6.25 seconds. Using the formula (25x)/w: (25*25)/100 = 625/100 = 6.25. That matches, so that's correct.\n\nSo the time per gallon is (25x)/w seconds. Now, for y gallons, it would be y multiplied by that. So time = y * (25x)/w seconds.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for how many minutes. Oh right, so I need to convert seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute. So I'll divide the total seconds by 60 to get minutes.\n\nSo total time in minutes is (y * 25x / w) / 60. Let me compute that. 25/60 is 5/12, so 25x/(60w) is 5x/(12w). So the total time is (5xy)/(12w) minutes.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 5xy/(12w). So that's the one.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recap:\n\n- Rate is (w/25) gallons per x seconds. So per gallon, time is x/(w/25) = (25x)/w seconds.\n- For y gallons, time is y*(25x/w) seconds.\n- Convert to minutes: (y*25x/w) /60 = (25xy)/(60w) = (5xy)/(12w) minutes.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer is option C.\n",

Let me read it again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nThe question says: A certain liquid passes through a drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. At that rate, how many minutes will it take y gallons to pass through the drain?\n\nHmm, so I'm supposed to find the time in minutes. The options are given, so I'll need to set up an equation correctly.\n\nFirst, let's break down the problem. The rate is given as w/25 gallons per x seconds. So, that's the flow rate. I think I can write that as (w/25) gallons per x seconds. \n\nWait, flow rate is usually in terms of volume per unit time. So here, it's (w/25) gallons every x seconds. So the rate in gallons per second would be (w/25) divided by x, right? Because if you have (w/25) gallons every x seconds, then per second, it's (w/25)/x.\n\nWait, no. Wait, actually, rate is (volume)/(time). So if it's (w/25) gallons in x seconds, then the rate is (w/25) / x. So gallons per second is (w)/(25x). Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nBut maybe I should write it as (w)/(25x) gallons per second. Alternatively, I can think of it as (w/25) gallons per x seconds, so to get gallons per second, I divide by x.\n\nSo the rate R is R = (w/25) / x = w/(25x) gallons per second.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, wait. Let's think. If I have a certain amount (w/25) of gallons passing through in x seconds, then per second, it's (w/25) divided by x. So yes, R = (w/25) / x = w/(25x) gallons per second.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should think in terms of units to make sure. Let's see: (w/25) gallons per x seconds. So the units are gallons/(x seconds). So the rate is (w/25) / x gallons per second, which is (w)/(25x) gallons per second.\n\nSo now, I need to find the time it takes to pass y gallons. So time is equal to volume divided by rate.\n\nTime t = y / R.\n\nSince R is w/(25x), then t = y / (w/(25x)) ) = y * (25x/w) ) = (25xy)/w seconds.\n\nBut the question asks for the time in minutes. Oh right, so I have to convert seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so I divide by 60.\n\nSo t in minutes is (25xy)/(w * 60) ) = (25xy)/(60w) = (5xy)/(12w) because 25 divided by 5 is 5, and 60 divided by 5 is 12.\n\nWait, let me check that division. 25 divided by 5 is 5, and 60 divided by 5 is 12. So yes, 25/60 reduces to 5/12.\n\nSo t = (5xy)/(12w) minutes. Looking at the options, option C is 5xy/(12w). So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n1. Rate: (w/25) gallons per x seconds. So per second, it's (w/25)/x = w/(25x) g/s.\n\n2. Time for y gallons: y / (w/(25x)) ) = y * 25x / w = (25xy)/w seconds.\n\n3. Convert seconds to minutes: (25xy/w) /60 = 25xy/(60w) = 5xy/(12w) \u2192 which is option C.\n\nHmm, that seems right. Another way to approach could be to find how many x seconds intervals are needed to get y gallons, then multiply by x to get the total time in seconds, then convert to minutes.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nEach x seconds, (w/25) gallons pass. So the number of intervals needed to get y gallons is y / (w/25) ) = (25y)/w.\n\nEach interval is x seconds, so total time in seconds is (25y/w) * x = (25xy)/w seconds.\n\nAgain, convert to minutes: (25xy/w)/60 = 25xy/(60w) = 5xy/(12w) \u2192 same as before.\n\nSo yes, the answer must be option C.\n",

Wait, wait. Let's think. If I have a certain amount (w/25) of gallons passing through in x seconds, then per second, it's (w/25) divided by x. So yes, R = (w/25) / x = w/(25x) gallons per second.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should think in terms of units to make sure. Let's see: (w/25) gallons per x seconds. So the units are gallons/(x seconds). So the rate is (w/25) / x gallons per second, which is (w)/(25x) gallons per second.\n\nSo now, I need to find the time it takes to pass y gallons. So time is equal to volume divided by rate.\n\nTime t = y / R.\n\nSince R is w/(25x), then t = y / (w/(25x)) ) = y * (25x/w) ) = (25xy)/w seconds.\n\nBut the question asks for the time in minutes. Oh right, so I have to convert seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so I divide by 60.\n\nSo t in minutes is (25xy)/(w * 60) ) = (25xy)/(60w) = (5xy)/(12w) because 25 divided by 5 is 5, and 60 divided by 5 is 12.\n\nWait, let me check that division. 25 divided by 5 is 5, and 60 divided by 5 is 12. So yes, 25/60 reduces to 5/12.\n\nSo t = (5xy)/(12w) minutes. Looking at the options, option C is 5xy/(12w). So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n1. Rate: (w/25) gallons per x seconds. So per second, it's (w/25)/x = w/(25x) g/s.\n\n2. Time for y gallons: y / (w/(25x)) ) = y * 25x / w = (25xy)/w seconds.\n\n3.

Another way to approach could be to find how many x seconds intervals are needed to get y gallons, then multiply by x to get the total time in seconds, then convert to minutes.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nEach x seconds, (w/25) gallons pass. So the number of intervals needed to get y gallons is y / (w/25) ) = (25y)/w.\n\nEach interval is x seconds, so total time in seconds is (25y/w) * x = (25xy)/w seconds.\n\nAgain, convert to minutes: (25xy/w)/60 = 25xy/(60w) = 5xy/(12w) \u2192 same as before.\n\nSo yes, the answer must be option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by determining the flow rate of the liquid. The liquid passes through the drain at a rate of \\( \\frac{w}{25} \\) gallons every \\( x \\) seconds. The flow rate in gallons per second is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Rate} = \\frac{\\frac{w}{25}}{x} = \\frac{w}{25x} \\, \\text{gallons per second}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the time required for \\( y \\) gallons to pass through the drain. Time is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time (in seconds)} = \\frac{\\text{Volume}}{\\text{Rate}} = \\frac{y}{\\frac{w}{25x}} = y \\cdot \\frac{25x}{w} = \\frac{25xy}{w} \\, \\text{seconds}.\n\\]\n\nSince the question asks for the time in minutes, we convert seconds to minutes by dividing by 60:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time (in minutes)} = \\frac{\\frac{25xy}{w}}{60} = \\frac{25xy}{60w}.\n\\]\n\nSimplifying \\( \\frac{25}{60} \\) to \\( \\frac{5}{12} \\), we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time (in minutes)} = \\frac{5xy}{12w}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: C**",

And I need to find how many minutes it takes for y gallons to pass through. So, I think I need to calculate the time based on the rate given.\n\nWait, so the rate is (w/25) gallons per x seconds. Oh right, that's the flow rate. So the basic formula I remember is rate equals amount divided by time. So rate = amount / time, which can be rearranged to time = amount / rate.\n\nRight, so the amount here is y gallons. The rate is (w/25) gallons per x seconds.

Because the rate is w/25 per x seconds, so to find the time, it's y divided by that rate. So let's compute that:\n\nTime (seconds) = y / ( (w/25) / x ) \n\nHmm, that's the same as y multiplied by (25x/w). Because dividing by a fraction is multiplying by its reciprocal.

The question is about calculating the time it takes for a certain amount of liquid to pass through, given the rate. I think I'll need to use some unit conversion here.\n\nAlright, the problem states that the liquid flows at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. So the rate is (w/25) gallons per x seconds. Wait, no, wait a second. The rate is given as w/25 gallons every x seconds. So that's the flow rate. So the rate is (w/25) divided by x, because it's per x seconds. Or wait, maybe I should think of it as (w/25) gallons per x seconds. So the rate R is (w/25) / x gallons per second. Or wait, no, no, wait: rate is amount over time. So if it's (w/25) gallons every x seconds, then the rate R is (w/25) divided by x, which is (w)/(25x) gallons per second.\n\nWait, no, maybe I should think of it as (w/25) gallons per x seconds. So that would be (w/25) / x = w/(25x) gallons per second. Alternatively, I can compute the rate in gallons per minute, which might be easier since the answer is in minutes.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the time in minutes. So perhaps it's better to find the rate in gallons per minute and then invert it to find the time.\n\nWait, no, the standard approach is: time equals amount divided by rate. So if I have y gallons, and the rate is R gallons per second, then time in seconds is y/R. But since the options are in minutes, I'd have to convert seconds to minutes by dividing by 60.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the rate in gallons per minute. Let's think about that.\n\nSo the current rate is (w/25) gallons every x seconds. So how many gallons per minute is that? Well, there are 60 seconds in a minute, so per minute, the number of x-second intervals is 60/x. So the rate in gallons per minute is (w/25) multiplied by (60/x). Let's compute that: (w/25) * (60/x) = (60w)/(25x) = (12w)/(5x) gallons per minute.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me recheck that. Because if it's (w/25) gallons every x seconds, then in one second, it's (w/25)/x gallons. So per minute, it's (w/25)/x * 60 = (60w)/(25x) = (12w)/(5x) gallons per minute. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nNow, we have y gallons to pass through. So the time in minutes would be the amount divided by the rate. So time T is y / (12w/(5x)). Let me compute that. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So T = y * (5x)/(12w) = (5xy)/(12w) minutes.\n\nWait, let's double-check. So if the rate is R = (w/25) / x gallons per second. Or in gallons per minute, R = (w/25) * (60/x) = (60w)/(25x) = (12w)/(5x). So the time T is y / R = y * (5x)/(12w) = (5xy)/(12w). So that's the time in minutes.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 5xy/(12w). So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me check the options again:\n\nA) y/(1200xy) \u2014 no, that's way too small.\n\nB) 20xy/w \u2014 that's larger than what I have.\n\nC) 5xy/(12w) \u2014 yes, that's what I got.\n\nD) w/(3xy) \u2014 no, that's not the same.\n\nE) 3y/(wx) \u2014 nope.\n\nSo the correct option is C.\n",

This can be expressed as a rate in gallons per second:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Rate (g/s)} = \\frac{\\frac{w}{25}}{x} = \\frac{w}{25x}.\n\\]\n\nThe time in seconds required for \\( y \\) gallons to pass through the drain is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time (s)} = \\frac{\\text{Amount}}{\\text{Rate}} = \\frac{y}{\\frac{w}{25x}} = y \\cdot \\frac{25x}{w} = \\frac{25xy}{w}.\n\\]\n\nTo convert this time into minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time (min)} = \\frac{25xy}{w \\cdot 60} = \\frac{25xy}{60w}.\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time (min)} = \\frac{5xy}{12w}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: C**",

Hmm, the question says the liquid flows at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. I need to find how many minutes it takes for y gallons to pass through. \n\nAlright, let's start by understanding the rate. The rate is given as (w/25) gallons per x seconds. So, the flow rate is w/25 divided by x, right? Wait, no, actually, wait. The rate is w/25 gallons every x seconds. So the rate in gallons per second would be (w/25) / x. Because if you have (w/25) gallons in x seconds, then per second it's that quantity divided by x. So, rate = (w)/(25x) gallons per second.\n\nWait, no, wait another way: rate is usually quantity over time. So (w/25) gallons in x seconds. So, rate R = (w/25) / x = w/(25x) gallons per second. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nNow, we need to find the time it takes to pass y gallons. Time is equal to quantity divided by rate. So time T = y / R. Substituting R, T = y / (w/(25x)) = y * (25x)/w = (25xy)/w seconds.\n\nBut the question asks for the time in minutes. Oh right, because the options are in minutes. So I need to convert seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute. So T in minutes is (25xy/w) / 60 = (25xy)/(60w) minutes.\n\nWait, let me simplify that fraction. 25 and 60 can both be divided by 5. 25 \u00f75=5, 60 \u00f75=12. So it becomes (5xy)/(12w) minutes.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 5xy/(12w), which matches. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, let me double-check. So the rate is (w/25) gallons per x seconds. Time for y gallons is y divided by (w/(25x)) seconds, which is 25xy/w seconds. Convert to minutes by dividing by 60: 25xy/(60w) = 5xy/(12w). Yep, that's correct. So option C is right.\n",
