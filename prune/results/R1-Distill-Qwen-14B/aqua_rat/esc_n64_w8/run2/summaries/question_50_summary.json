      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where a product's price is reduced by 30%, and I need to figure out by what percentage it should be increased to bring it back to 100% of its original price. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nWait, the question is a bit tricky because it's about percentage changes. I remember that percentage changes don't work linearly when you reverse them. Like, if you decrease something by a certain percentage, you don't just increase it by the same percentage to get back to the original. Right, because the base changes after the decrease.\n\nLet me think of it with numbers to make it clearer. Let's say the original price is $100. Oh wait, that might make the math easier because percentages are straightforward then. So original price, P = 100.\n\nAfter a 30% decrease, the new price is P' = P - 30% of P. So that's 100 - 30 = 70. So now the price is $70.\n\nNow, the question is, by what percentage should this new price ($70) be increased to bring it back to $100? So I need to find the percentage increase, let's call it x%, such that:\n\n70 + (x% of 70) = 100.\n\nLet me write that as an equation: 70 * (1 + x) = 100. Or, 70*(1 + x) = 100. I'm solving for x here.\n\nWait, no, actually, it's 70 + (x/100)*70 = 100. So factor out 70: 70*(1 + x/100) = 100.\n\nSo to solve for x, I can divide both sides by 70. That gives me (1 + x/100) = 100/70.\n\nCalculating 100 divided by 70... 100/70 is approximately 1.42857. So 1 + x/100 = 1.42857.\n\nSubtracting 1 from both sides: x/100 = 0.42857. Multiply both sides by 100: x \u2248 42.857%.\n\nHmm, looking at the options, option B is 42.86%, which is about the same as 42.857%. So the correct answer should be B.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Suppose I take the new price, $70, and increase it by 42.86%. 42.86% of 70 is (42.86/100)*70 = approximately 30.002. Adding that to 70 gives 100.002, which is almost 100, considering rounding errors. So yeah, that makes sense.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the formula for percentage increase needed is (Original - New)/New * 100%. So (100 -70)/70 *100% = 30/70 *100% \u224842.857%, which again is 42.86%. So definitely, option B is the right choice.\n",

Let me read it again: The price of a product is reduced by 30%. By what percentage should it be increased to make it 100%? The options are A to E, with various percentages.\n\nHmm, wait, I'm not exactly sure what \"make it 100%\" means. Oh, I think it means bringing the price back to its original 100% after it's been reduced. So, let's say the original price is P. If it's reduced by 30%, the new price is P minus 30% of P, which is 70% of P. So, the new price is 0.7P.\n\nNow, the question is, what percentage increase from this reduced price (0.7P) will bring it back to the original P? Because 100% of the original is P. So, we need to find the percentage increase needed on 0.7P to get back to P.\n\nLet me think about percentage increase. The formula for percentage increase is [(Final Value - Initial Value)/Initial Value] * 100%. In this case, the initial value is 0.7P, and the final value is P.

The price of a product is reduced by 30%, and then I need to find out by what percentage it should be increased to make it 100% of the original price. Hmm, okay, so the question is about percentage changes and how they affect the price.\n\nWait, I think I need to break this down step by step. Let me imagine a product's original price. Let's say the original price is $100. That makes the math easier because percentages will directly translate to dollar amounts.\n\nSo, the original price is $100. It's reduced by 30%. So the new price after the discount is 100 minus 30% of 100. 30% of 100 is $30, so the new price is $70.\n\nNow, the question is, by what percentage do I need to increase this $70 to get back to the original $100? Because 100% of the original is $100, so we want to find the percentage increase from $70 to $100.\n\nI remember that percentage increase is calculated by (Final Value - Initial Value) divided by the Initial Value, then multiplied by 100 to get the percentage. So here, the initial value is $70, and the final is $100.\n\nCalculating the difference: 100 - 70 = 30. So the increase needed is $30.\n\nNow, divide that by the initial value after the discount: 30 / 70. Let me compute that. 30 divided by 70 equals... well, 30 divided by 70 is 0.42857 approximately. Multiply that by 100 to get the percentage: 42.857%. So roughly 42.86%.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps. Because sometimes when dealing with percentages, it's easy to mix up the base. So, the initial price after the discount is 70, and we're finding the percentage increase from 70 to 100. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should represent this algebraically to make sure. Let me let the original price be P. After a 30% reduction, the new price is P*(1 - 0.30) = 0.70P.\n\nWe need to find the percentage increase x such that 0.70P increased by x% brings it back to P. So:\n\n0.70P * (1 + x) = P.\n\nDivide both sides by P: 0.70*(1 + x) = 1.\n\nDivide both sides by 0.70: 1 + x = 1 / 0.70.\n\n1 / 0.70 is approximately 1.42857. So 1 + x = 1.42857.\n\nSubtract 1: x = 0.42857, which is about 42.857%, so 42.86% when rounded to two decimal places.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B is 42.86%. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me compute 1 divided by 0.7. 0.7 is the same as 7/10. So 1 divided by (7/10) is 10/7, which is approximately 1.42857. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the percentage increase needed is approximately 42.86%, which is option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again. The price of a product is reduced by 30%, and then I need to find out by what percentage it should be increased to make it 100% of the original price. Hmm, okay, so the question is about percentage changes and how they affect the price.\n\nWait, I think I need to break this down step by step. Let me imagine a product's original price. Let's say the original price is $100. That makes the math easier because percentages will directly translate to dollar amounts.\n\nSo, the original price is $100. It's reduced by 30%. So the new price after the discount is 100 minus 30% of 100. 30% of 100 is $30, so the new price is $70.\n\nNow, the question is, by what percentage do I need to increase this $70 to get back to the original $100? Because 100% of the original is $100, so we want to find the percentage increase from $70 to $100.\n\nI remember that percentage increase is calculated by (Final Value - Initial Value) divided by the Initial Value, then multiplied by 100 to get the percentage. So here, the initial value is $70, and the final is $100.\n\nCalculating the difference: 100 - 70 = 30. So the increase needed is $30.\n\nNow, divide that by the initial value after the discount: 30 / 70. Let me compute that. 30 divided by 70 equals... well, 30 divided by 70 is 0.42857 approximately. Multiply that by 100 to get the percentage: 42.857%. So roughly 42.86%.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps. Because sometimes when dealing with percentages, it's easy to mix up the base. So, the initial price after the discount is 70, and we're finding the percentage increase from 70 to 100. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should represent this algebraically to make sure. Let me let the original price be P. After a 30% reduction, the new price is P*(1 - 0.30) = 0.70P.\n\nWe need to find the percentage increase x such that 0.70P increased by x% brings it back to P. So:\n\n0.70P * (1 + x) = P.\n\nDivide both sides by P: 0.70*(1 + x) = 1.\n\nDivide both sides by 0.70: 1 + x = 1 / 0.70.\n\n1 / 0.70 is approximately 1.42857. So 1 + x = 1.42857.\n\nSubtract 1: x = 0.42857, which is about 42.857%, so 42.86% when rounded to two decimal places.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B is 42.86%. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me compute 1 divided by 0.7. 0.7 is the same as 7/10. So 1 divided by (7/10) is 10/7, which is approximately 1.42857. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the percentage increase needed is approximately 42.86%, which is option B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let the original price of the product be \\( P \\). After a 30% reduction, the new price becomes:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{new}} = P \\times (1 - 0.30) = 0.70P\n\\]\n\nThe goal is to find the percentage increase required to bring the price from \\( 0.70P \\) back to \\( P \\). Let the required percentage increase be \\( x \\). The equation for the new price after the increase is:\n\n\\[\n0.70P \\times (1 + x) = P\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\( P \\), we get:\n\n\\[\n0.70 \\times (1 + x) = 1\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n1 + x = \\frac{1}{0.70} \\approx 1.42857\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = 1.42857 - 1 \\approx 0.42857\n\\]\n\nConverting \\( x \\) to a percentage:\n\n\\[\nx \\approx 0.42857 \\times 100 \\approx 42.86\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, the price must be increased by approximately **42.86%** to return to the original price.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question says: \"The price of a product is reduced by 30%. By what percentage should it be increased to make it 100%.\" Hmm, wait, wait. Wait, wait. I think I might have misread that. Oh no, no, wait, wait. The original wording is, \"The price of a product is reduced by 30%. By what percentage should it be increased to make it 100%.\" Wait, no, 100% of what? Oh, maybe I'm getting confused because the phrasing is a bit unclear. Let me think.\n\nOh, perhaps the question is saying that after a 30% decrease, what percentage increase is needed to bring it back to its original price. Because 100% of the original price would be the target. So, if the price drops by 30%, what percentage increase from that reduced price will get us back to the original price.\n\nLet me rephrase the problem in my own words. Suppose the original price is P. Then it's reduced by 30%, so the new price is P minus 30% of P, which is P*(1 - 0.30) = 0.70P. Now, we need to find the percentage increase (let's call it x) such that when we apply it to 0.70P, we get back to P. So, mathematically, that's 0.70P * (1 + x) = P. \n\nSo, I can set up the equation: 0.70 * (1 + x) = 1. Because when we solve for x, we'll find the multiplier needed to go from 0.70 to 1. \n\nDividing both sides by 0.70 gives (1 + x) = 1 / 0.70. Let me calculate 1 divided by 0.7. Hmm, 0.7 is the same as 7/10, so 1 divided by (7/10) is 10/7. Which is approximately 1.42857. \n\nSo, 1 + x = 1.42857. Subtracting 1 from both sides gives x \u2248 0.42857. To express this as a percentage, I multiply by 100, so x \u2248 42.857%. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is 42.86%, which matches this calculation. So, the correct answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me take an example. Suppose the original price is $100. After a 30% decrease, the price is $70. To find out what percentage increase on $70 brings it back to $100, the increase needed is $30. So, the percentage increase is (30 / 70) * 100% = approximately 42.857%. Yep, that's the same as before. So, the answer is definitely B.\n",
