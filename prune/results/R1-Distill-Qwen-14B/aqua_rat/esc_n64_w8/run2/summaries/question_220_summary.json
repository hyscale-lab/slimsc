      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a worker's wages over a fortnight, which is 15 days. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on averages, but I think I can figure this out.\n\nThe question says the average wage per day was $90 for the entire 15 days. So, first, maybe I should find the total wages for all 15 days. Since average is total divided by the number of days, then total would be average multiplied by the number of days. So 15 days times $90 per day. Let me calculate that: 15 * 90. Hmm, 15*90 is 1350. So the total wages are $1350 for the 15 days.\n\nNow, the problem breaks this into three parts: the first 7 days, the 8th day, and the last 7 days. Wait, wait, 7 + 1 +7 is 15, so that adds up. So the first 7 days, the average was $87 per day. So the total for the first 7 days is 7 * 87. Let me compute that. 7*80 is 560, and 7*7 is 49, so 560+49=609. So first 7 days total $609.\n\nThen, the last 7 days had an average of $92 per day. So total for those is 7*92. Let me calculate that. 7*90 is 630, and 7*2 is 14, so 630+14=644. So last 7 days total $644.\n\nWait, but the entire 15 days total is 1350, and the first 7 and last 7 add up to 609 + 644 = 1253. So 1253 is the sum of the first and last 7 days. So what's left is the 8th day's wage.\n\nBecause 1350 total minus 1253 is 1350-1253. Let me do that subtraction. 1350 minus 1253. Hmm, 1253 plus 97 is 1350, because 1253 + 97 = 1350. So the 8th day's wage must be $97.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my math to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Maybe I added something wrong.\n\nFirst 7 days: 7 *87=609. Yes, 7*80=560, 7*7=49, 560+49=609.\n\nLast 7 days:7*92=644. 7*90=630, 7*2=14, so 630+14=644. Correct.\n\nTotal of first and last 7: 609 + 644. Let's add 600 + 600 = 1200, 9+44=53, so 1200+53=1253. Correct.\n\nTotal of all 15 days is 1350. 1350 minus 1253 is 97. So yes, the 8th day is $97.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is $97. So the answer should be D.\n",

Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe question says that a worker's average wage over a fortnight, which is 15 consecutive working days, was $90 per day. So, the total wages for the fortnight must be 15 days multiplied by $90 per day. Let me calculate that: 15 * 90 equals $1350.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about average wages. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe question says that a worker's average wage over a fortnight, which is 15 consecutive working days, was $90 per day. So, the total wages for the fortnight must be 15 days multiplied by $90 per day. Let me calculate that: 15 * 90 equals $1350. So, the total earnings are $1350 for the 15 days.\n\nNow, the problem also says that during the first 7 days, his average wage was $87 per day. So, the total for those 7 days would be 7 * 87. Let me compute that: 7 times 80 is 560, and 7 times 7 is 49, so 560 +49 is 609. So, the first 7 days he earned $609.\n\nThen, during the last 7 days, his average wage was $92 per day. So, the total for those 7 days would be 7 * 92. Hmm, 7*90 is 630, and 7*2 is 14, so 630+14 is 644. So, the last 7 days he made $644.\n\nWait a minute, so the first 7 days are $609, the last 7 are $644. But the total for all 15 days is $1350. Let me add the first and last 7 days together: 609 + 644 equals 1253. So, 1253 is the total for the first 7 and last 7 days.\n\nBut the total for all 15 days is 1350. So, the remaining amount must be the wage on the 8th day, which is the middle day. Because the fortnight is 15 days, so days 1-7, then day 8, then days 9-15 (which are 7 days). So, the 8th day is the only day left.\n\nSo, subtract 1253 from 1350 to find the 8th day's wage. Let me do that: 1350 - 1253 equals... 97? Wait, 1253 + 97 is 1350, yes. Because 1253 + 97 is 1350. So, the wage on the 8th day was $97.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is $97.

Let me see, 7*90 is 630, and 7*2 is 14, so 630 +14=644. So the last 7 days total $644.\n\nWait, but the fortnight is 15 days, which is 7 + 8th day + 7. So the 8th day is the middle one. So the total for the first 7 is 609, the last 7 is 644. But what about the 8th day? Let's call that x.\n\nSo the total of all 15 days is 609 (first 7) + x (8th day) + 644 (last 7) = 1350.\n\nLet me add 609 and 644 first. 609 + 644: 600+600 is 1200, 9+44 is 53, so total 1253. Wait, no, wait: 609 + 644. Let me compute it properly. 609 + 644. Hmm, 600 + 600 is 1200, 9 + 44 is 53. So 1200 +53=1253. So 1253 plus x equals 1350.\n\nSo x = 1350 - 1253. Let me subtract. 1350 - 1253. 1253 +47=1300, but 1350 is 50 more than 1300. Wait, let me do it step by step. 1253 + x =1350. So x=1350-1253. 1350 minus 1250 is 100, minus 3 more is 97. So x is 97. So his wage on the 8th day was $97.\n\nLooking at the options, D is $97. So the answer must be D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a worker's wages over a fortnight, which is 15 days. Hmm, let me read it again. The average wages per day were $90. So for all 15 days, the total would be 15 multiplied by 90. Let me calculate that: 15 * 90 is 1350. So the total wages for the fortnight are $1350.\n\nNow, the first part says that during the first 7 days, his average was $87 per day. So the total for those 7 days is 7 * 87. Let me do that math: 7*80 is 560, and 7*7 is 49, so 560 +49=609. So he earned $609 in the first week.\n\nThen, the last 7 days have an average of $92. So that's 7*92. Let me see, 7*90 is 630, and 7*2 is 14, so 630 +14=644. So the last 7 days total $644.\n\nWait, but the fortnight is 15 days, which is 7 + 8th day + 7. So the 8th day is the middle one. So the total for the first 7 is 609, the last 7 is 644. But what about the 8th day? Let's call that x.\n\nSo the total of all 15 days is 609 (first 7) + x (8th day) + 644 (last 7) = 1350.\n\nLet me add 609 and 644 first. 609 + 644: 600+600 is 1200, 9+44 is 53, so total 1253. Wait, no, wait: 609 + 644. Let me compute it properly. 609 + 644. Hmm, 600 + 600 is 1200, 9 + 44 is 53. So 1200 +53=1253. So 1253 plus x equals 1350.\n\nSo x = 1350 - 1253. Let me subtract. 1350 - 1253. 1253 +47=1300, but 1350 is 50 more than 1300. Wait, let me do it step by step. 1253 + x =1350. So x=1350-1253. 1350 minus 1250 is 100, minus 3 more is 97. So x is 97.
