So the number of choices he has is one\u2014because he can only take all 10. There's no other option because he doesn't have more friends than needed.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Because if he needs exactly 10 people and he has 10 friends, the number of ways he can choose 10 people from 10 is combination of 10 choose 10, which is 1.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"how many choices does he have for forming his team.\" So if he has exactly 10 friends, and he needs to choose 10, then he can only choose all of them.

So the number of choices is 1. \n\nSo the answer should be option B, which is 1.\n\n\nPeter needs to form a team of 10 additional people, and he has exactly 10 friends who are willing to join. To determine how many choices he has, we calculate the number of ways to choose 10 people out of 10, which is a combinatorial problem. Using the formula for combinations, \\( \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\), where \\( n = 10 \\) and \\( k = 10 \\), we find:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{10}{10} = \\frac{10!}{10!(10-10)!} = \\frac{10!}{10! \\cdot 0!} = 1\n\\]\n\nSince there is only one way to choose all 10 friends, the number of choices Peter has is 1.\n\nAnswer: B",
