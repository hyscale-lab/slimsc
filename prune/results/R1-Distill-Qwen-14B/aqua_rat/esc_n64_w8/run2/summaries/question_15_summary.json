      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question here about rearranging the letters of the word \"PROBLEM\" to make 7-letter words without any repeating letters. The options given are A) 2!, B) 3!, C)7!, D)8!, E)9!.\n\nHmm, wait, first, I should make sure I understand the question correctly. The word is \"PROBLEM\", right? Let me count the letters. P, R, O, B, L, E, M. Oh wait, that's seven letters. So each letter is unique, no repeats in the original word.\n\nThe question is asking how many ways can these letters be rearranged to form 7-letter words without any repetition. Oh, right, because each letter is unique, any rearrangement will automatically have no repeats.\n\nSo I think this is a permutation problem. When all the letters are distinct, the number of permutations is n factorial, where n is the number of letters. So for \"PROBLEM\", n is 7. That would make the number of ways 7! (which is 5040).\n\nWait, but looking at the options, C is 7! and D is 8! So why would there be an 8! option? Let me double-check the word. Oh, wait, the word in the question is \"PROBLEC\". Wait, wait, no, the user wrote \"PROBLEM\" in the initial statement, but the question says \"PROBLEC\". Wait, no, looking again. Oh wait, the question says \"PROBLEM\" in the first line, but the actual word is \"PROBLEC\"? Let me check.\n\nWait, the user wrote: \"In how many ways can the letters of the word 'PROBLEM' be rearranged...\" Oh wait, no, the actual word is \"PROBLEM\"? Or is it \"PROBLEM\" or \"PROBLEC\"? Wait, the user wrote the question as \"PROBLEM\" but the problem statement says \"PROBLEC\"?\n\nWait, the user wrote: \"the word 'PROBLEM' be rearranged\". Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me re-read the question.\n\nQuestion: \"In how many ways can the letters of the word 'PROBLEM' be rearranged to make 7 letter words such that none of the letters repeat?\"\n\nWait, no, the word is \"PROBLEM\" as written. So the letters are P, R, O, B, L, E, M. So seven unique letters. So the number of rearrangements would be 7! since all letters are distinct.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options again: option C is 7!, which would be correct. But wait, why is there an option D)8!? Did I miscount the letters in the word?\n\nWait, the original word is \"PROBLEM\" which is seven letters. So 7 letters, all unique. So the number of permutations is 7!.\n\nSo the correct answer should be 7!, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, why is option D 8!? Maybe the word has eight letters? Let me count again. P, R, O, B, L, E, M. That's seven letters. So no, the correct number is 7!.\n\nWait, but in the initial problem statement, the user wrote \"PROBLEM\" but the word in the question is \"PROBLEM\" or \"PROBLEC\"? Wait, the question says \"PROBLEM\" in the initial statement, but the word in the question is \"PROBLEM\"? Let me recheck.\n\nThe user wrote: \"the letters of the word 'PROBLEM' be rearranged...\" Oh, no, perhaps I misread. Let me see:\n\nThe question is: \"In how many ways can the letters of the word 'PROBLEM' be rearranged to make 7 letter words such that none of the letters repeat?\"\n\nWait, the word 'PROBLEM' is seven letters, all unique, so the answer is 7!.\n\nSo the correct option is C)7!.\n\nWait, but the options include D)8! which is 40320, and E)9! which is even bigger. So why would someone think 8!?\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the word. Maybe the word is \"PROBLEM\" with an extra letter? Let me count again.\n\nWait, P R O B L E M: that's seven letters. So no, 7 letters. So 7! is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the word is \"PROBLEM\" with an extra letter, like \"PROBLEM\" (8 letters), but that's not the case here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the word is \"PROBLEM\" but with a duplicate letter, but the question says none of the letters repeat, so the original word must have all unique letters.\n\nSo in this case, the number of rearrangements is 7!, so option C.\n",

So it's just the total number of permutations.\n\nSo yeah, the answer should be 7! which is option C.\n\n\nThe word \"PROBLEM\" consists of 7 unique letters. To determine the number of ways to rearrange these letters into a 7-letter word without repetition, we calculate the number of permutations of 7 distinct items, which is given by \\(7!\\). \n\nCalculating \\(7!\\):\n\\[\n7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 5040\n\\]\n\nThe other options (A: \\(2!\\), B: \\(3!\\), D: \\(8!\\), and E: \\(9!\\)) are either too small or correspond to scenarios with a different number of letters, which is not the case here. Since all letters are unique and no repetition is allowed, the correct answer is \\(7!\\).\n\nAnswer: C",
