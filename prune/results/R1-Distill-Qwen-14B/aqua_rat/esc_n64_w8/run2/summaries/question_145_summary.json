      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the ratio of the volumes between a cube and a sphere that fits inside it. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I'm a bit rusty on geometry, but I'll try to remember the formulas.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the cube and the sphere inside it. The sphere that fits perfectly inside the cube would be touching the cube exactly at the centers of each face. That means the sphere's diameter is equal to the cube's edge length, right? Because if the sphere is inside, the distance from one side of the cube to the other is the diameter of the sphere.\n\nLet me assign some variables to make this easier. Let's say the edge length of the cube is 'a'. Then the volume of the cube, which I'll call V_cube, would be a^3. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, for the sphere inside. Since the sphere's diameter is equal to the cube's edge length 'a', the radius of the sphere (r) would be half of that, so r = a/2.\n\nThe volume of a sphere is given by the formula (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3. Substituting r = a/2 into that, the sphere's volume V_sphere becomes (4/3)\u03c0*(a/2)\u00b3. Let me calculate that. \n\n(a/2) cubed is a\u00b3/(2\u00b3) = a\u00b3/8. So multiplying by 4/3\u03c0 gives (4/3)\u03c0*(a\u00b3/8) = (4\u03c0 a\u00b3)/(24), which simplifies to (\u03c0 a\u00b3)/6. So V_sphere = \u03c0 a\u00b3 /6.\n\nNow I need the ratio of the cube's volume to the sphere's volume. That would be V_cube : V_sphere, which is a\u00b3 : (\u03c0 a\u00b3 /6). \n\nWait, the a\u00b3 terms can be canceled out since they're in both the numerator and denominator. So that leaves 1 : (\u03c0 /6). To make this a ratio without fractions, I can invert it. Alternatively, I can write it as (a\u00b3) / (\u03c0 a\u00b3/6) = 6/\u03c0. \n\nSo the ratio is 6 to \u03c0. Looking at the options, option D says 6:\u03c0. That should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The cube's edge is 'a', sphere's diameter is 'a', radius a/2. Volume of cube a\u00b3, sphere (4/3)\u03c0(a/2)^3. Yes, that's correct. (a/2)^3 is a\u00b3/8. Multiply by 4/3\u03c0 gives (4\u03c0 a\u00b3)/(24) = \u03c0 a\u00b3/6. So cube is a\u00b3, sphere is \u03c0 a\u00b3/6. Ratio cube/sphere is a\u00b3 / (\u03c0 a\u00b3/6) = 6/\u03c0. So 6:\u03c0 is the ratio. So option D is correct.\n",

I'm a bit rusty on geometry, but I think I can work through it.\n\nAlright, the cube. The sphere that fits inside a cube would be touching the cube exactly at the centers of each face. So the sphere is perfectly inscribed in the cube. That means the diameter of the sphere is equal to the edge length of the cube, right? Because if the sphere is touching the cube's sides, the diameter can't be bigger than the cube's edge, otherwise it wouldn't fit.\n\nLet me think. Let's denote the edge length of the cube as 'a'. Then the sphere's diameter would be 'a', so the radius would be a/2. Got it.\n\nNow, I need to find the volumes of both the cube and the sphere and then find their ratio. Let's start with the cube. The volume of a cube is straightforward\u2014it's just edge length cubed. So the cube's volume V_cube is a^3.\n\nNext, the sphere's volume. The formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3)\u03c0r^3. Since the radius r is a/2, substituting that in, the volume V_sphere would be (4/3)\u03c0*(a/2)^3. Let me compute that. (a/2)^3 is a^3/(8), so the sphere's volume is (4/3)*(\u03c0)*(a^3/8). Simplifying that, 4 divided by 8 is 0.5, so 0.5 * \u03c0 * (a^3/3) or (4/3)*(1/8) is (1/6). Wait, no, let me recompute. 4/3 multiplied by (a^3)/(8) is (4 a^3)/(24), which simplifies to a^3/(6). So V_sphere is (\u03c0 a^3)/6.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Let me do it again. (4/3)\u03c0*(a/2)^3. Let's calculate (a/2)^3: that's a^3/8. So 4/3 * a^3/8 is (4a^3)/(24) which is a^3/6. So V_sphere = \u03c0 * (a^3/6) = \u03c0 a^3 /6.\n\nSo now, the ratio of the cube's volume to the sphere's volume is V_cube : V_sphere. Plugging in the values, that's a^3 : (\u03c0 a^3 /6). Oh, wait, the a^3 terms will cancel out because they're in both numerator and denominator. So the ratio becomes 1 : (\u03c0/6). To express this as a ratio, I can write it as 1 multiplied by 6/\u03c0, so 6/\u03c0. So the ratio is 6 : \u03c0.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 6 : \u03c0. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Cube volume is a^3. Sphere's volume is (4/3)\u03c0r^3. r is a/2, so (4/3)\u03c0*(a/2)^3 = (4/3)\u03c0*(a^3/8) = (4 a^3 \u03c0) / 24 = a^3 \u03c0 /6. So cube's volume is a^3, sphere is (\u03c0 a^3)/6. So ratio is a^3 / (\u03c0 a^3 /6) = 6/\u03c0. So the ratio is 6:\u03c0, which is option D. Yep, that's correct.\n",

So the sphere's volume is (4/3)\u03c0*(a\u00b3/8) which simplifies to (4\u03c0 a\u00b3)/(24). Oh wait, 4 divided by 24 is 1/6. So it's (\u03c0 a\u00b3)/6.\n\nSo now I have both volumes.

But the question asks for the ratio of cube to sphere, which is 1 divided by (\u03c0/6) \u2192 6/\u03c0. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Because when you have a ratio, cube volume divided by sphere volume is (a\u00b3) / [(\u03c0 a\u00b3)/6] = (1) / (\u03c0/6) = 6/\u03c0.

Because the ratio is cube to sphere, which is (a\u00b3) / [(4/3)\u03c0(r)^3], and since r is a/2, substituting gives (a\u00b3) / [(4/3)\u03c0(a/2)^3]. Let's compute that again.\n\nCompute the denominator: (4/3)\u03c0*(a\u00b3/8) = (4\u03c0 a\u00b3)/(24) = \u03c0 a\u00b3 /6. So the cube volume is a\u00b3. So the ratio is a\u00b3 / (\u03c0 a\u00b3/6) = 6/\u03c0. So yes, the ratio is 6:\u03c0, which is option D.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: if the cube has side length 'a', the sphere's diameter is 'a', so radius r = a/2. Volume of cube is a\u00b3, sphere is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3 = (4/3)\u03c0(a/2)^3 = (4\u03c0 a\u00b3)/(24) = \u03c0 a\u00b3/6.

Because when you have a ratio, cube volume divided by sphere volume is (a\u00b3) / [(\u03c0 a\u00b3)/6] = (1) / (\u03c0/6) = 6/\u03c0. So the ratio is 6:\u03c0.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is 6:\u03c0. Oh, but wait another thought\u2014maybe I messed up the ratio. Because the ratio is cube to sphere, which is (a\u00b3) / [(4/3)\u03c0(r)^3], and since r is a/2, substituting gives (a\u00b3) / [(4/3)\u03c0(a/2)^3]. Let's compute that again.\n\nCompute the denominator: (4/3)\u03c0*(a\u00b3/8) = (4\u03c0 a\u00b3)/(24) = \u03c0 a\u00b3 /6. So the cube volume is a\u00b3. So the ratio is a\u00b3 / (\u03c0 a\u00b3/6) = 6/\u03c0. So yes, the ratio is 6:\u03c0, which is option D.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: if the cube has side length 'a', the sphere's diameter is 'a', so radius r = a/2. Volume of cube is a\u00b3, sphere is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3 = (4/3)\u03c0(a/2)^3 = (4\u03c0 a\u00b3)/(24) = \u03c0 a\u00b3/6. So the ratio is a\u00b3 : (\u03c0 a\u00b3/6) \u2192 simplifying by dividing both by a\u00b3 gives 1 : \u03c0/6 \u2192 which is 6/\u03c0 when expressed as cube to sphere. So the ratio is 6:\u03c0. So option D.\n\n\nTo determine the ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which fits inside it, we start by defining the edge length of the cube as \\( a \\). The volume of the cube is then \\( a^3 \\).\n\nFor the sphere, since it perfectly fits inside the cube, its diameter is equal to the edge length of the cube, which means the radius of the sphere is \\( r = \\frac{a}{2} \\). The volume of the sphere is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( r = \\frac{a}{2} \\) into the formula:\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\left( \\frac{a}{2} \\right)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\frac{a^3}{8} = \\frac{\\pi a^3}{6}\n\\]\n\nNow, the ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the sphere is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{V_{\\text{cube}}}{V_{\\text{sphere}}} = \\frac{a^3}{\\frac{\\pi a^3}{6}} = \\frac{a^3 \\cdot 6}{\\pi a^3} = \\frac{6}{\\pi}\n\\]\n\nThus, the ratio of the volumes of the cube to the sphere is \\( 6 : \\pi \\).\n\nFrom the given options, the correct answer is:\n\n**D) 6: \u03c0**\n\nAnswer: D",

Then the volume of the cube is straightforward: V_cube = a^3.\n\nNow, the sphere inside. The diameter of the sphere is equal to 'a', so the radius (r) is half of that. So r = a/2.\n\nThe volume of a sphere is given by the formula V_sphere = (4/3)\u03c0r^3. Substituting r with a/2, that becomes (4/3)\u03c0*(a/2)^3. Let me calculate that. (a/2)^3 is a^3/8, so multiplying by 4/3\u03c0 gives (4/3) * (\u03c0 a^3 /8) \u2192 (4\u03c0 a^3)/(24) \u2192 simplifies to \u03c0 a^3 /6.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 4/3 times (a\u00b3/8) is (4 a\u00b3)/(24) when multiplied by \u03c0, which is (a\u00b3 \u03c0)/6. Yes, that's right.\n\nSo now, the ratio of the cube's volume to the sphere's volume is V_cube : V_sphere. Plugging in the values, that's a^3 : (\u03c0 a^3 /6). \n\nThe a^3 terms cancel out, so it becomes 1 : (\u03c0/6). To write this as a ratio, I can invert the denominator to get 6/\u03c0. Wait, wait, no. Let me think: 1 divided by (\u03c0/6) is 6/\u03c0, so the ratio is 6/\u03c0, but wait, the question asks for the cube's volume to the sphere's. So cube is a^3, sphere is \u03c0 a^3 /6. So a^3 divided by (\u03c0 a^3 /6) equals 6/\u03c0. So the ratio is 6 : \u03c0.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 6:\u03c0. So that must be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the order. The question says the ratio of the cube to the sphere. So cube is larger, sphere is smaller. So 6/\u03c0 is correct because 6 is larger than \u03c0 (since \u03c0 is about 3.14), so 6/3.14 is roughly 1.9, which makes sense because the cube's volume should be larger than the sphere's.\n\nLet me check the options again. Option D is 6:\u03c0, which matches what I calculated. So the answer should be D.\n",

That sphere should touch the cube exactly at the centers of each face of the cube, right? So the sphere is perfectly inscribed in the cube. \n\nWait, so how are the dimensions related? Well, the sphere's diameter must be equal to the cube's edge length. Because if the sphere is touching the cube on all sides, the distance from one face of the cube to the opposite face is the diameter of the sphere. So, if the cube has a side length of 'a', then the sphere's diameter is 'a', which makes the sphere's radius 'a/2'.\n\nNow, I need to find the volumes of both the cube and the sphere. Let's start with the cube. The volume of a cube is side length cubed, so that's a\u00b3. \n\nNext, the sphere's volume. The formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3. Since the radius r is a/2, I'll substitute that into the formula.

The question asks for the ratio of the cube's volume to the sphere's. So that would be a\u00b3 : (\u03c0 a\u00b3)/6.\n\nWhen I take the ratio, the a\u00b3 terms will cancel out.

Consequently, the radius of the sphere is \\( r = \\frac{a}{2} \\).\n\nThe volume of the cube is straightforward:  \n\\[\nV_{\\text{cube}} = a^3\n\\]\n\nFor the sphere, the volume is given by the formula:  \n\\[\nV_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3\n\\]  \nSubstituting \\( r = \\frac{a}{2} \\):  \n\\[\nV_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\frac{a^3}{8} = \\frac{\\pi a^3}{6}\n\\]\n\nThe ratio of the cube's volume to the sphere's volume is:  \n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{V_{\\text{cube}}}{V_{\\text{sphere}}} = \\frac{a^3}{\\frac{\\pi a^3}{6}} = \\frac{6}{\\pi}\n\\]  \nThus, the ratio is \\( 6 : \\pi \\).\n\nFrom the given options, the correct answer is:  \n**D) 6: \u03c0**\n\nAnswer: D",
