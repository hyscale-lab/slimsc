      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a club where the members' ages form an arithmetic progression (A.P.). Hmm, I remember that an A.P. is a sequence where each term increases by a common difference. In this case, the common difference is 3 months. So, every next member is 3 months older than the previous one.\n\nThe youngest member is 7 years old. Wait, but the common difference is in months, so I should probably convert everything into the same units to avoid confusion. Let me think: 7 years is 7 * 12 = 84 months. That makes sense because then each subsequent member's age increases by 3 months.\n\nThe sum of all the members' ages is 250. Wait, is that in years or months? The question says the sum is 250, but I'm not sure. Oh, wait, the youngest is 7 years old, so I think the sum is in years. Hmm, but when I convert the ages to months, it might be easier to calculate the sum. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me outline the given data:\n- Common difference (d) = 3 months = 0.25 years (since 3/12 is 0.25). Wait, maybe it's better to work in months to keep everything in the same unit. So, let's do all calculations in months.\n\nSo, the youngest is 84 months old. The next is 87, then 90, and so on.\n\nWe need to find the number of members, let's say n. The sum of an A.P. is given by the formula: S = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d], where 'a' is the first term, 'd' is the common difference, and 'n' is the number of terms.\n\nWait, but what's the sum in the problem? Oh, wait, the sum is given as 250. But is that in years or months? The problem says the sum is 250, but the ages are in years and months. Hmm, this could be a point of confusion. Let me re-read the question.\n\nThe problem says the sum of the ages is 250. Wait, but the ages are in A.P. with a common difference of 3 months. The youngest is 7 years, so perhaps the sum is in years, but the ages are in a mix.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because 250 years for a club's member sum would be impossible. So perhaps I misread the sum unit. Wait, the problem says the sum is 250. It doesn't specify units, but the ages are given in years and the common difference in months.

So I should convert the common difference into years for the formula.\n\nWait, maybe I should stick to the same unit. Let me think: perhaps it's better to calculate everything in months.

So perhaps the sum is in years, but each member's age is in years with a 3-month difference.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum is in years, but each age is in years, so the common difference is 3 months which is 0.25 years.\n\nLet me try that approach. So:\n\na = 7 years\nd = 0.25 years\nSum (S) = 250 years\nn = ?\n\nSum formula: S = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n250 = n/2 * [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n2*7 = 14\n(n-1)*0.25 = 0.25n - 0.25\n\nSo, 14 + 0.25n - 0.25 = 13.75 + 0.25n\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n250 = (n/2) * (13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n500 = n*(13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nWhich is:\n\n500 = 13.75n + 0.25n\u00b2\n\nLet me rearrange this into standard quadratic form:\n\n0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n -500 = 0\n\nMultiply all terms by 4 to eliminate the decimal:\n\nn\u00b2 + 55n -2000 = 0\n\nNow, solve for n using quadratic formula.\n\nThe quadratic equation is n\u00b2 +55n -2000 = 0.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, n = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a)\n\nHere, a=1, b=55, c=-2000.\n\nDiscriminant D = 55\u00b2 + 4*1*2000 = 3025 + 8000 = 11025.\n\nsqrt(11025) = 105.\n\nSo, n = [-55 \u00b1 105]/(2*1)\n\nWe can ignore the negative solution because number of members can't be negative.\n\nSo,\n\nn = (-55 +105)/2 = 50/2 =25.\n\nSo n=25.\n\nWait, but the options include 25 as option C. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's plug n=25 into the sum formula.\n\nSum = 25/2 * [2*7 + (25-1)*0.25]\n\nCalculate inside the brackets:\n\n2*7=14.\n\n24 * 0.25 =6.\n\nSo 14 +6=20.\n\nSum = (25/2)*20 = 25 *10=250.

The youngest member is 7 years old, and the sum of all their ages is 250. I need to find out how many members are in the club. The options are A)18, B)20, C)25, D)26, E)27.\n\nHmm, let me think. I remember that in an AP, each term increases by a common difference. Here, the common difference is 3 months, so each member is 3 months older than the previous one.\n\nWait, the youngest is 7 years old. So the first term, a1, is 7 years. The next would be 7 years and 3 months, then 7 years and 6 months, and so on.\n\nBut wait, the sum of the ages is given as 250. That's in years, I suppose. So maybe I should convert everything into months to avoid confusion. Let me try that.\n\nSo, 7 years is 7 * 12 = 84 months. The common difference is 3 months. The sum of all their ages is 250 years, which is 250 * 12 = 3000 months.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Because 250 years is a really long time. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the sum of the ages of all the members is 250. Wait, is that in years? Or in months? The problem says \"sum of the ages of all the members is 250.\" Hmm. It's ambiguous, but probably in years because the ages are given in years. So 250 is in years, so 250 years in total for all members.\n\nWait, but when I have the common difference in months, maybe I should convert everything to months to avoid confusion. Because 3 months is a quarter of a year, so perhaps using months as the unit will make the calculations easier.\n\nSo, let me restate the problem in months:\n\n- Youngest member (a1) is 7 years = 7 * 12 = 84 months.\n- Common difference (d) is 3 months.\n- Sum of all ages (S_n) is 250 years = 250 * 12 = 3000 months.\n- Number of terms (n) is what we're looking for.\n\nNow, the formula for the sum of an AP is S_n = n/2 * [2a1 + (n-1)d]. \n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n3000 = (n/2) * [2*84 + (n-1)*3]\n\nLet me compute that step by step. \n\nFirst, 2*84 is 168. Then, (n-1)*3 is 3n -3. So the bracket becomes 168 + 3n -3 = 165 +3n.\n\nSo now the equation is 3000 = (n/2) * (165 + 3n).\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n6000 = n * (165 + 3n)\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n6000 = 165n + 3n\u00b2\n\nLet me rearrange this into a standard quadratic equation:\n\n3n\u00b2 + 165n - 6000 = 0\n\nHmm, I can divide all terms by 3 to simplify:\n\nn\u00b2 + 55n - 2000 = 0\n\nWait, wait, let me check that division again. 3n\u00b2 divided by 3 is n\u00b2. 165n/3 is 55n. 6000/3 is 2000, but it's negative, so -2000. So yes, the equation becomes n\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Wait, 6000 divided by 3 is 2000. So the equation is n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0.\n\nWait, let me double-check the earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the sum: S_n = (n/2) [2a1 + (n-1)d]\n\na1 is 84 months, d is 3 months.\n\nSo 2a1 is 168, (n-1)*3 is 3n-3. So 168 +3n-3 = 165+3n. Correct.\n\nSo (n/2)(165+3n) = 3000. Multiply both sides by 2: n(165 +3n) =6000.\n\nSo 3n\u00b2 +165n =6000. Subtract 6000: 3n\u00b2 +165n -6000=0.\n\nDivide by 3: n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0.\n\nNow, solving the quadratic equation n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0.\n\nI can use the quadratic formula. For ax\u00b2 +bx +c=0, the solutions are (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)) / (2a).\n\nHere, a=1, b=55, c= -2000.\n\nDiscriminant D = 55\u00b2 -4*1*(-2000) = 3025 +8000 = 11025.\n\nSquare root of 11025 is 105, since 105*105=11025.\n\nSo n = [-55 \u00b1105]/2.\n\nWe can ignore the negative solution because the number of members can't be negative.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a club where the members' ages form an arithmetic progression, or AP. The common difference is 3 months. The youngest member is 7 years old, and the sum of all their ages is 250. I need to find out how many members are in the club. The options are A)18, B)20, C)25, D)26, E)27.\n\nHmm, let me think. I remember that in an AP, each term increases by a common difference. Here, the common difference is 3 months, so each member is 3 months older than the previous one.\n\nWait, the youngest is 7 years old. So the first term, a1, is 7 years. The next would be 7 years and 3 months, then 7 years and 6 months, and so on.\n\nBut wait, the sum of the ages is given as 250. That's in years, I suppose. So maybe I should convert everything into months to avoid confusion. Let me try that.\n\nSo, 7 years is 7 * 12 = 84 months. The common difference is 3 months. The sum of all their ages is 250 years, which is 250 * 12 = 3000 months.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Because 250 years is a really long time. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the sum of the ages of all the members is 250. Wait, is that in years? Or in months? The problem says \"sum of the ages of all the members is 250.\" Hmm. It's ambiguous, but probably in years because the ages are given in years. So 250 is in years, so 250 years in total for all members.\n\nWait, but when I have the common difference in months, maybe I should convert everything to months to avoid confusion. Because 3 months is a quarter of a year, so perhaps using months as the unit will make the calculations easier.\n\nSo, let me restate the problem in months:\n\n- Youngest member (a1) is 7 years = 7 * 12 = 84 months.\n- Common difference (d) is 3 months.\n- Sum of all ages (S_n) is 250 years = 250 * 12 = 3000 months.\n- Number of terms (n) is what we're looking for.\n\nNow, the formula for the sum of an AP is S_n = n/2 * [2a1 + (n-1)d]. \n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n3000 = (n/2) * [2*84 + (n-1)*3]\n\nLet me compute that step by step. \n\nFirst, 2*84 is 168. Then, (n-1)*3 is 3n -3. So the bracket becomes 168 + 3n -3 = 165 +3n.\n\nSo now the equation is 3000 = (n/2) * (165 + 3n).\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n6000 = n * (165 + 3n)\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n6000 = 165n + 3n\u00b2\n\nLet me rearrange this into a standard quadratic equation:\n\n3n\u00b2 + 165n - 6000 = 0\n\nHmm, I can divide all terms by 3 to simplify:\n\nn\u00b2 + 55n - 2000 = 0\n\nWait, wait, let me check that division again. 3n\u00b2 divided by 3 is n\u00b2. 165n/3 is 55n. 6000/3 is 2000, but it's negative, so -2000. So yes, the equation becomes n\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Wait, 6000 divided by 3 is 2000. So the equation is n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0.\n\nWait, let me double-check the earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the sum: S_n = (n/2) [2a1 + (n-1)d]\n\na1 is 84 months, d is 3 months.\n\nSo 2a1 is 168, (n-1)*3 is 3n-3. So 168 +3n-3 = 165+3n. Correct.\n\nSo (n/2)(165+3n) = 3000. Multiply both sides by 2: n(165 +3n) =6000.\n\nSo 3n\u00b2 +165n =6000. Subtract 6000: 3n\u00b2 +165n -6000=0.\n\nDivide by 3: n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0.\n\nNow, solving the quadratic equation n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0.\n\nI can use the quadratic formula. For ax\u00b2 +bx +c=0, the solutions are (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)) / (2a).\n\nHere, a=1, b=55, c= -2000.\n\nDiscriminant D = 55\u00b2 -4*1*(-2000) = 3025 +8000 = 11025.\n\nSquare root of 11025 is 105, since 105*105=11025.\n\nSo n = [-55 \u00b1105]/2.\n\nWe can ignore the negative solution because the number of members can't be negative. So (-55 +105)/2 = 50/2 =25. Or (-55 -105)/2 = -160/2 =-80, which is negative, so we discard that.\n\nSo n=25.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, C is 25, which is one of the choices. So the answer should be C)25.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the arithmetic.\n\nLet me verify the sum with n=25.\n\nSum S_n = (25/2) [2*84 + (25-1)*3]\n\nCompute 2*84=168.\n\n(25-1)=24, 24*3=72.\n\nSo 168 +72=240.\n\nThen S_n = (25/2)*240 =25 *120=3000 months, which is 3000/12=250 years. Yes, that matches the given sum.\n\nSo yes, 25 members.

I need to find out how many members are in the club, and the options are A)18, B)20, C)25, D)26, E)27.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. First, I remember that in an A.P., each term after the first is obtained by adding a common difference. Here, the common difference is 3 months. But wait, the ages are given in years for the youngest and the sum. So I should probably convert everything to the same unit to avoid confusion. Let me convert the common difference to years. Since 3 months is a quarter of a year, 3/12 = 0.25 years. So the common difference d is 0.25 years.\n\nThe youngest member is 7 years old. So the first term of the A.P., let's call it a1, is 7. The next term would be 7 + 0.25, then 7 + 2*0.25, and so on.\n\nLet me denote the number of members as n. So the ages are 7, 7.25, 7.5, ..., up to the nth term.\n\nThe sum of an A.P. is given by the formula S = n/2 * (2a1 + (n-1)d), where S is the sum, a1 is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms. Alternatively, another formula is S = n*(a1 + an)/2, where an is the last term.\n\nI'll use the first formula because I don't know the last term. So, plugging in the values I have:\n\n250 = n/2 * [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]\n\nSimplify the equation step by step.\n\nFirst, 2*7 is 14.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n250 = (n/2) * [14 + 0.25(n-1)]\n\nLet me compute 0.25(n-1). That's (n-1)/4. So 14 + (n-1)/4.\n\nLet me write the equation again:\n\n250 = (n/2) * [14 + (n-1)/4]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n500 = n * [14 + (n-1)/4]\n\nLet me compute the terms inside the brackets. Let's write 14 as 56/4 to combine the terms.\n\nSo, 56/4 + (n-1)/4 = (56 + n -1)/4 = (55 + n)/4.\n\nNow the equation is:\n\n500 = n * (55 + n) / 4\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n2000 = n*(55 + n)\n\nWhich becomes:\n\nn\u00b2 +55n - 2000 = 0\n\nNow, this is a quadratic equation in the form of an\u00b2 + bn + c =0. Let's solve for n using the quadratic formula.\n\nThe quadratic formula is n = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)] / (2a)\n\nHere, a = 1, b=55, c= -2000.\n\nCalculating the discriminant first:\n\nD = b\u00b2 -4ac = 55\u00b2 - 4*1*(-2000) = 3025 + 8000 = 11025.\n\nWhat's the square root of 11025? Let me think. 105 squared is 11025 because 100\u00b2=10000 and 5\u00b2=25, and (100+5)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5 +5^2=10000+1000+25=11025. So sqrt(11025)=105.\n\nSo the solutions are:\n\nn = [-55 \u00b1105]/(2*1)\n\nWe can ignore the negative solution because the number of members can't be negative.\n\nSo, n = (-55 + 105)/2 = (50)/2 =25.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculation. 55 +105 is 160? Wait, no: 55 is the b term, which is positive 55. Wait, no, the formula is [-b \u00b1 sqrt(D)]/(2a). So in this case, -55 +105 is 50, so 50/2=25. Alternatively, -55 -105 would be negative, so discard that.\n\nSo n=25.\n\nLooking at the options, C is 25. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me verify this because sometimes when dealing with arithmetic sequences, especially in real-world scenarios, the number of terms might have to be an integer. But in this case, our solution is 25, which is an integer, so that's fine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the unit conversion. Let me double-check the initial steps.\n\nThe common difference is 3 months. I converted that into years as 0.25 years. So each term increases by 0.25 years. That seems correct.\n\nThe sum is 250 years. Hmm, wait, the sum is 250, but the individual ages are in years, so the sum is in years. So 250 is the sum of the ages in years.\n\nSo the calculations seem correct.\n\nAnother way to check: If n=25, let's compute the sum and see if it's 250.\n\nCompute a1=7, d=0.25, n=25.\n\nSum S= n/2*(2a1 + (n-1)d) =25/2*(14 +24*0.25)\n\n24 *0.25 is 6.

So 250 is the sum of the ages in years.\n\nSo the calculations seem correct.\n\nAnother way to check: If n=25, let's compute the sum and see if it's 250.\n\nCompute a1=7, d=0.25, n=25.\n\nSum S= n/2*(2a1 + (n-1)d) =25/2*(14 +24*0.25)\n\n24 *0.25 is 6. So 14 +6=20.\n\nSo 25/2 *20=25*10=250. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer is 25, which is option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that the ages of the club members form an arithmetic progression (A.P.) with the youngest member being 7 years old and a common difference of 3 months (which is 0.25 years). The total sum of the ages is 250 years, and we need to determine the number of members, \\( n \\).\n\nThe sum of an A.P. is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{n}{2} \\cdot [2a_1 + (n-1)d]\n\\]\n\nHere:\n- \\( S = 250 \\) (total sum of ages),\n- \\( a_1 = 7 \\) (age of the youngest member),\n- \\( d = 0.25 \\) (common difference in years).\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n250 = \\frac{n}{2} \\cdot [2(7) + (n-1)(0.25)]\n\\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\\[\n250 = \\frac{n}{2} \\cdot [14 + 0.25(n-1)]\n\\]\n\n\\[\n250 = \\frac{n}{2} \\cdot \\left[14 + \\frac{n-1}{4}\\right]\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n500 = n \\cdot \\left[14 + \\frac{n-1}{4}\\right]\n\\]\n\nCombine terms inside the brackets:\n\n\\[\n500 = n \\cdot \\left[\\frac{56 + n - 1}{4}\\right]\n\\]\n\n\\[\n500 = n \\cdot \\frac{55 + n}{4}\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\n\\[\n2000 = n \\cdot (55 + n)\n\\]\n\nRearrange into a quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\nn^2 + 55n - 2000 = 0\n\\]\n\nSolve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 55 \\), and \\( c = -2000 \\).

The youngest member is 7 years old, and the total sum of all their ages is 250. I need to find out how many members are in the club, and the options are given as A to E.\n\nHmm, let me think. I remember that in an AP, the terms increase by a common difference. Here, the difference is 3 months, which is 0.25 years because 3 divided by 12 is 0.25. So each subsequent member is 0.25 years older than the previous one.\n\nThe youngest is 7 years old. So the ages would be 7, 7.25, 7.5, and so on. I need to find the number of terms (n) in this AP such that their sum is 250.\n\nWait, the formula for the sum of an AP is S = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d], where S is the sum, a is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms.\n\nLet me plug in the values I have. Here, a is 7 years, d is 0.25 years, and S is 250.\n\nSo substituting, 250 = n/2 * [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]. Let me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate 2a. 2 *7 is 14. Then, (n-1)*d is (n-1)*0.25. So the term inside the brackets becomes 14 + 0.25(n-1).\n\nSo, 250 = (n/2) * [14 + 0.25(n-1)].\n\nLet me simplify this equation. Let's multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n500 = n * [14 + 0.25(n-1)].\n\nExpanding the right side: 14n + 0.25n(n-1). Let me compute 0.25(n-1) as 0.25n - 0.25. So the equation becomes:\n\n500 = 14n + 0.25n\u00b2 - 0.25n.\n\nCombine like terms. 14n -0.25n is 13.75n. So:\n\n500 = 0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n.\n\nLet me multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the decimal. 4*500 is 2000, and 4*0.25n\u00b2 is n\u00b2, 4*13.75n is 55n.\n\nSo now the equation is:\n\nn\u00b2 +55n = 2000.\n\nBring 2000 to the left:\n\nn\u00b2 +55n -2000 = 0.\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation. Let me write it as n\u00b2 +55n -2000 = 0.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, n = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)] / (2a). Here, a=1, b=55, c=-2000.\n\nCompute discriminant D: 55\u00b2 -4*1*(-2000) = 3025 + 8000 = 11025.\n\nWhat's the square root of 11025? Let me think. 105 squared is 11025 because 100\u00b2 is 10000, 105\u00b2 is 11025. So sqrt(11025) is 105.\n\nSo n = [ -55 \u00b1105 ] / 2.\n\nWe can ignore the negative solution because the number of members can't be negative. So (105 -55)/2 is 50/2=25, and ( -55-105 )/2 is negative, so we take 25.\n\nWait, so n=25? Looking at the options, option C is 25. So that would be the answer.\n\nWait, let me check my calculations again to be sure.\n\nLet me recheck the sum formula. Sum S = n/2 [2a + (n-1)d]. So with a=7, d=0.25, S=250.\n\nSo 250 = n/2 [14 + 0.25(n-1)].\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: 500 = n [14 +0.25n -0.25].\n\nWhich simplifies to 500 =n(13.75 + 0.25n).\n\nExpanding, 500 =13.75n +0.25n\u00b2.\n\nMultiply all terms by 4: 2000 =55n +n\u00b2.\n\nSo n\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0.\n\nQuadratic formula: n= [-55 \u00b1sqrt(55\u00b2 +4*2000)] /2. 55\u00b2 is 3025, 4*2000 is 8000, so sqrt(11025)=105.\n\nThus, n=( -55 +105 )/2 =50/2=25.

The youngest member is 7 years old, and the sum of all their ages is 250. I need to find the number of members. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in an A.P., each term increases by a common difference. Here, that difference is 3 months, which is a quarter of a year. So the common difference, d, is 3/12 = 0.25 years.\n\nThe youngest member is 7 years old, so the first term of the A.P., a1, is 7. Let's say there are n members. Then the ages would be 7, 7.25, 7.5, and so on, up to the nth term.\n\nThe formula for the sum of an A.P. is Sn = n/2 * [2a1 + (n-1)d]. Wait, no, another version is Sn = n*(a1 + an)/2, where an is the last term. Either way, I can use them interchangeably. Let me use the first one because I have a1 and d.\n\nSo plugging in the values: Sum S = 250 = n/2 * [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]. Let me compute that.\n\nCompute 2*7: that's 14. Then (n-1)*0.25 is 0.25n - 0.25. So inside the brackets, it's 14 + 0.25n - 0.25. Simplify that: 14 - 0.25 is 13.75, so 13.75 + 0.25n.\n\nSo the equation becomes 250 = (n/2) * (13.75 + 0.25n). Let's multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator: 500 = n*(13.75 + 0.25n).\n\nExpanding the right side: 500 = 13.75n + 0.25n\u00b2.\n\nHmm, that's a quadratic equation. Let me rearrange it to standard form. Subtract 500 from both sides:\n\n0.25n\u00b2 + 13.75n - 500 = 0.\n\nTo make it easier, I can multiply all terms by 4 to eliminate the decimal. That gives:\n\nn\u00b2 + 55n - 2000 = 0. Wait, let me check: 0.25 *4 is 1, 13.75*4 is 55, and 500*4 is 2000. But wait, the equation was 0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n -500 =0. Multiply by 4: n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0.\n\nNow I have n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0. I can try to solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is ax\u00b2 + bx + c =0, so a=1, b=55, c= -2000.\n\nThe quadratic formula says n = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a). Plugging in the values:\n\nDiscriminant D = 55\u00b2 -4*1*(-2000) = 3025 + 8000 = 11025. The square root of 11025 is 105, because 105*105 is 11025.\n\nSo n = [ -55 \u00b1 105 ] / 2.\n\nWe have two solutions: ( -55 + 105 )/2 = 50/2=25, and ( -55-105 )/2= -160/2= -80. But the number of members can't be negative, so n=25.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option C is 25. So that's the answer. But wait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nWait, let me recheck the equation setup. The sum is n/2*(2a1 + (n-1)d). So a1 is 7, d is 0.25. So 2a1 is 14. (n-1)*0.25 is 0.25n -0.25. So 14 + 0.25n -0.25 is 13.75 + 0.25n. So sum is n/2*(13.75 + 0.25n) =250. So multiplying by 2: n*(13.75 +0.25n)=500.\n\nExpanding: 0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n -500 =0. Multiply by 4: n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0.\n\nQuadratic solution: n = [-55 \u00b1 sqrt(55\u00b2 + 4*2000)]/2. 55 squared is 3025. 4*2000=8000. 3025+8000=11025. sqrt(11025)=105. So [ -55 +105 ] /2=50/2=25.

Let me use the first one because I have a1 and d.\n\nSo plugging in the values: Sum S = 250 = n/2 * [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]. Let me compute that.\n\nCompute 2*7: that's 14. Then (n-1)*0.25 is 0.25n - 0.25. So inside the brackets, it's 14 + 0.25n - 0.25. Simplify that: 14 - 0.25 is 13.75, so 13.75 + 0.25n.\n\nSo the equation becomes 250 = (n/2) * (13.75 + 0.25n). Let's multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator: 500 = n*(13.75 + 0.25n).\n\nExpanding the right side: 500 = 13.75n + 0.25n\u00b2.\n\nHmm, that's a quadratic equation. Let me rearrange it to standard form. Subtract 500 from both sides:\n\n0.25n\u00b2 + 13.75n - 500 = 0.\n\nTo make it easier, I can multiply all terms by 4 to eliminate the decimal. That gives:\n\nn\u00b2 + 55n - 2000 = 0. Wait, let me check: 0.25 *4 is 1, 13.75*4 is 55, and 500*4 is 2000. But wait, the equation was 0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n -500 =0. Multiply by 4: n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0.\n\nNow I have n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0. I can try to solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is ax\u00b2 + bx + c =0, so a=1, b=55, c= -2000.\n\nThe quadratic formula says n = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a). Plugging in the values:\n\nDiscriminant D = 55\u00b2 -4*1*(-2000) = 3025 + 8000 = 11025. The square root of 11025 is 105, because 105*105 is 11025.\n\nSo n = [ -55 \u00b1 105 ] / 2.\n\nWe have two solutions: ( -55 + 105 )/2 = 50/2=25, and ( -55-105 )/2= -160/2= -80. But the number of members can't be negative, so n=25.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option C is 25. So that's the answer. But wait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nWait, let me recheck the equation setup. The sum is n/2*(2a1 + (n-1)d). So a1 is 7, d is 0.25. So 2a1 is 14. (n-1)*0.25 is 0.25n -0.25. So 14 + 0.25n -0.25 is 13.75 + 0.25n. So sum is n/2*(13.75 + 0.25n) =250. So multiplying by 2: n*(13.75 +0.25n)=500.\n\nExpanding: 0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n -500 =0. Multiply by 4: n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0.\n\nQuadratic solution: n = [-55 \u00b1 sqrt(55\u00b2 + 4*2000)]/2. 55 squared is 3025. 4*2000=8000. 3025+8000=11025. sqrt(11025)=105. So [ -55 +105 ] /2=50/2=25. Correct.\n\nSo n=25 is the solution. Looking at the options, option C is 25.\n\n\nThe problem involves a club where the ages of the members are in an arithmetic progression (A.P.) with a common difference of 3 months (0.25 years). The youngest member is 7 years old, and the sum of all ages is 250. We need to determine the number of members, \\( n \\).\n\nThe sum of an A.P. is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nS_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\left[ 2a_1 + (n-1)d \\right],\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( a_1 = 7 \\) (the first term), \\( d = 0.25 \\) (the common difference), and \\( S_n = 250 \\).

Compute the discriminant:\n\n\\[\nb^2 - 4ac = 55^2 - 4(1)(-2000) = 3025 + 8000 = 11025.\n\\]\n\nThe square root of the discriminant is:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{11025} = 105.\n\\]\n\nSubstitute back into the formula:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-55 \\pm 105}{2}.\n\\]\n\nThis gives two solutions:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-55 + 105}{2} = \\frac{50}{2} = 25, \\quad n = \\frac{-55 - 105}{2} = -80.\n\\]\n\nSince the number of members cannot be negative, \\( n = 25 \\). Thus, the number of members in the club is **25**.\n\nAnswer: C",

Hmm, I remember that in an arithmetic progression (AP), each term increases by a common difference. Here, the common difference is 3 months. The youngest member is 7 years old, and the total sum of all their ages is 250. I need to find the number of members.\n\nWait, let me think about the details. The ages are in AP, so the first term (a1) is 7 years. The common difference (d) is 3 months. Oh, but wait, the units are different\u2014years and months. I should convert everything to the same unit to avoid confusion. Since the common difference is in months, maybe I'll convert the ages to months as well.\n\nSo, 7 years is 7 * 12 = 84 months. The common difference is 3 months, so each subsequent member is 3 months older than the previous one.\n\nThe sum of an AP is given by the formula S = n/2 * (2a1 + (n-1)d), where n is the number of terms. Or wait, another version is S = n*(a1 + an)/2, where an is the last term. Since I don't know the last term, maybe the first formula is better.\n\nWait, the sum S is given as 250 years. Oh no, wait, wait. The sum is 250 years? Or is it 250 months? That's a crucial point. Let me check the problem statement again. Oh, it says the sum is 250. Hmm, the units aren't specified, but given that the ages are in years and the difference is in months, it's likely that the sum is in years.\n\nBut wait, that might complicate things because the ages are in months when using the common difference. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should convert the sum into months to keep the units consistent.\n\nWait, 250 years would be a huge sum. Let me see. For example, if there are 20 members, each averaging 12.5 years, the sum would be 250. But that seems possible. Alternatively, if the sum is 250 years, but let's think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should convert everything into months. Let me try that.\n\nSo, the sum S is 250 years. Converting that into months: 250 * 12 = 3000 months.\n\nThe first term a1 is 7 years = 84 months.\n\nThe common difference d is 3 months.\n\nThe sum of an AP is S = n/2 * [2a1 + (n-1)d]\n\nSo, substituting the known values:\n\n3000 = n/2 * [2*84 + (n-1)*3]\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n2*84 = 168, and (n-1)*3 = 3n -3.\n\nSo, inside the brackets: 168 + 3n -3 = 3n + 165.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n3000 = (n/2) * (3n + 165)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n6000 = n * (3n + 165)\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n6000 = 3n\u00b2 + 165n\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n3n\u00b2 + 165n - 6000 = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 3 to simplify:\n\nn\u00b2 + 55n - 2000 = 0\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation: n\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0.\n\nI can use the quadratic formula to solve for n. The quadratic formula is n = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a), where a=1, b=55, c=-2000.\n\nCompute discriminant D:\n\nD = 55^2 - 4*1*(-2000) = 3025 + 8000 = 11025.\n\nWhat's the square root of 11025? Let me think. 105^2 is 11025 because 100^2 is 10000, 105^2 is 11025.\n\nSo sqrt(11025) = 105.\n\nSo n = [ -55 \u00b1 105 ] / 2.\n\nWe can discard the negative solution because number of members can't be negative.\n\nSo n = ( -55 +105 ) / 2 = (50)/2 =25.\n\nWait, so n=25. So the number of members is 25. Let me check the options. Option C is 25.\n\nBut wait, let me verify this because sometimes I might have made a mistake in unit conversion.\n\nWait, let me see. The sum is 250 years. Converting to months is 3000. Then, plugging into the formula, I got n=25.\n\nLet me check the sum with n=25.\n\na1=84 months.\n\nd=3.\n\nSum S = 25/2 * [2*84 + (25-1)*3]\n\nCompute inside the brackets:\n\n2*84=168, 24*3=72. So 168+72=240.\n\nMultiply by 25/2: (25/2)*240 = 25 * 120 = 3000 months.\n\nWhich is 3000/12=250 years. So yes, correct.\n\nWait, but the options include 25 as option C. So that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the problem statement, the options are A)18, B)20, C)25, D)26, E)27.\n\nSo the correct answer should be C)25.\n\nBut wait, I just thought of another possibility. What if the sum was in years but the individual ages are in years and the common difference is 3 months. So perhaps I shouldn't have converted the sum to months.\n\nWait, let me try that approach again.\n\nIf the sum is 250 years, and each age is in years, then perhaps I should keep the sum in years and the common difference in years.\n\nWait, 3 months is 0.25 years.\n\nSo, a1=7, d=0.25 years.\n\nSum S = n/2 * [2a1 + (n-1)d] = 250.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n250 = (n/2) * [14 + (n-1)*0.25 ]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n500 = n [14 + 0.25(n-1) ]\n\nExpand:\n\n500 = n [14 + 0.25n -0.25 ]\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n14 -0.25 is 13.75, so 13.75 + 0.25n.\n\nSo:\n\n500 = n (0.25n +13.75 )\n\nMultiply out:\n\n500 = 0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the decimal:\n\n2000 = n\u00b2 +55n\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nn\u00b2 +55n -2000=0.\n\nWhich is the same quadratic as before! So same solution: n=25.\n\nSo regardless of whether I convert everything to months or work in years with decimal, I end up with the same equation and n=25.\n\nSo the number of members is 25, option C.\n",

The goal is to determine the number of members in the club.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Convert Units for Consistency**:  \n   - The youngest member's age is 7 years, which is equivalent to \\( 7 \\times 12 = 84 \\) months.  \n   - The common difference is 3 months.  \n   - The total sum of ages is given as 250 years, which is equivalent to \\( 250 \\times 12 = 3000 \\) months.\n\n2. **Sum Formula for AP**:  \n   The sum of an AP is given by:  \n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{n}{2} \\left[ 2a_1 + (n-1)d \\right]\n   \\]  \n   Substituting the known values:  \n   \\[\n   3000 = \\frac{n}{2} \\left[ 2 \\times 84 + (n-1) \\times 3 \\right]\n   \\]  \n   Simplify inside the brackets:  \n   \\[\n   2 \\times 84 = 168, \\quad (n-1) \\times 3 = 3n - 3\n   \\]  \n   So, the equation becomes:  \n   \\[\n   3000 = \\frac{n}{2} \\left[ 168 + 3n - 3 \\right] = \\frac{n}{2} \\left[ 3n + 165 \\right]\n   \\]  \n   Multiply through by 2 to eliminate the denominator:  \n   \\[\n   6000 = n \\left[ 3n + 165 \\right]\n   \\]  \n   Expand and rearrange:  \n   \\[\n   3n^2 + 165n - 6000 = 0\n   \\]  \n   Divide by 3 to simplify:  \n   \\[\n   n^2 + 55n - 2000 = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve the Quadratic Equation**:  \n   Use the quadratic formula:  \n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n   \\]  \n   Here, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 55 \\), and \\( c = -2000 \\). Compute the discriminant:  \n   \\[\n   D = 55^2 - 4(1)(-2000) = 3025 + 8000 = 11025\n   \\]  \n   The square root of \\( D \\) is \\( \\sqrt{11025} = 105 \\). Substituting into the formula:  \n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{-55 \\pm 105}{2}\n   \\]  \n   Discard the negative solution, leaving:  \n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{-55 + 105}{2} = \\frac{50}{2} = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verification**:  \n   Check if \\( n = 25 \\) satisfies the sum condition. Using the AP sum formula:  \n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{25}{2} \\left[ 2 \\times 84 + (25-1) \\times 3 \\right]\n   \\]  \n   Simplify inside the brackets:  \n   \\[\n   2 \\times 84 = 168, \\quad 24 \\times 3 = 72, \\quad 168 + 72 = 240\n   \\]  \n   So:  \n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{25}{2} \\times 240 = 25 \\times 120 = 3000 \\, \\text{months} = 250 \\, \\text{years}\n   \\]  \n   The calculation is consistent with the given sum.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe number of members in the club is **25**, which corresponds to option **C**.\n\nAnswer: C",

The youngest member is 7 years old, and the sum of all their ages is 250. I need to find out how many members are in the club.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. First, I remember that in an AP, each term after the first is obtained by adding a common difference. Here, the common difference is 3 months. But wait, the youngest is given in years. Maybe I should convert everything to the same unit to avoid confusion. Let's see, 3 months is a quarter of a year, so 0.25 years. Or maybe I can work in months entirely. Let's think about that.\n\nWait, the youngest is 7 years old. Let's convert that to months because the common difference is in months. 7 years is 7 * 12 = 84 months. Each subsequent member is 3 months older than the previous. So the ages in months would be 84, 87, 90, and so on.\n\nThe sum of all the ages is 250 years. Wait, 250 years? That seems like a lot for a club. Oh wait, no, probably 250 years in total. Or wait, the sum of the ages is 250 years? Or is it 250 months? Hmm, the problem says \"sum of the ages of all the members is 250\". So probably 250 years? That would make the average age around 250 divided by number of members. But wait, 250 years for, say, 20 members would be an average age of 12.5 years. But let's not get ahead of ourselves.\n\nWait, but the ages are in AP with a common difference of 3 months. So it's easier to handle if everything is in months. Let me convert the sum into months as well. So 250 years is 250 * 12 = 3000 months. Wait, 250 *12 is 3000. So the sum of all the ages in months is 3000.\n\nSo now, the problem is: the ages are in AP, starting at 84 months, with a common difference of 3 months. The sum of the AP is 3000 months. Find the number of terms (n) in the AP.\n\nI remember the formula for the sum of an AP: S = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d], where S is the sum, a is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms.\n\nSo plugging in the values I have:\nS = 3000\na = 84\nd = 3\n\nSo,\n3000 = (n/2) * [2*84 + (n-1)*3]\n\nLet me simplify the inside of the brackets first. 2*84 is 168. (n-1)*3 is 3n -3. So adding those gives 168 +3n -3 = 3n + 165.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n3000 = (n/2) * (3n + 165)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n6000 = n*(3n + 165)\n\nExpanding the right side:\n6000 = 3n\u00b2 + 165n\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:\n3n\u00b2 + 165n -6000 = 0\n\nHmm, perhaps I can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 3 to make the numbers smaller.\n\n3n\u00b2 /3 = n\u00b2\n165n /3 =55n\n-6000 /3 =-2000\n\nSo the equation becomes:\nn\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check the calculation.\n\nWait, 3n\u00b2 +165n -6000 =0 \u2192 dividing by 3: n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0. Yes.\n\nNow I need to solve this quadratic equation for n. Since n must be a positive integer, I can use the quadratic formula.\n\nThe quadratic formula is n = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a)\n\nHere, a=1, b=55, c=-2000.\n\nSo discriminant D = 55\u00b2 -4*1*(-2000) = 3025 +8000 = 11025.\n\nWhat's the square root of 11025? Let me think. 105^2 is 11025 because 100^2 is 10000, 105^2 is 11025. So sqrt(11025)=105.\n\nSo, n = [-55 \u00b1105]/2\n\nWe can ignore the negative solution because n can't be negative. So,\n\nn = (-55 +105)/2 = (50)/2=25\n\nSo n=25. Let me check the options. Option C is 25. So the number of members is 25.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations. Let me re-calculate the sum with n=25.\n\nSum S = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d]\n\nn=25, a=84, d=3.\n\nSo, 2a=168, (25-1)*3=24*3=72. So 168+72=240.\n\nSo sum S=25/2 * 240 = (25)*120 =3000 months, which is 250 years. That matches the given sum.\n\nSo yeah, the answer should be 25, which is option C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a club where the members' ages form an arithmetic progression (AP). The common difference is 3 months. The youngest member is 7 years old, and the total sum of all their ages is 250. I need to find out how many members are in the club. The options are A)18, B)20, C)25, D)26, E)27.\n\nHmm, let me think. First, I remember that in an arithmetic progression, each term increases by a common difference. Here, the difference is 3 months, which is a quarter of a year. So that's 0.25 years. The youngest is 7 years old, so the ages would go 7, 7.25, 7.5, etc., depending on the number of members.\n\nWait, the sum of an AP is given by the formula S = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d], where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as S = n*(a1 + an)/2, where a1 is the first term and an is the last term.\n\nSo I think I can use either formula. Let's define the variables properly. Let me convert everything into years to make it consistent. The common difference d is 0.25 years (since 3 months is a quarter of a year). The first term a is 7 years.\n\nThe sum S is 250 years. So plugging into the formula:\n\nS = n/2 [2a + (n-1)d]\n\nSo 250 = (n/2) * [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n2*7 is 14. Then (n-1)*0.25 is 0.25n - 0.25.\n\nSo the expression becomes 14 + 0.25n - 0.25 = 13.75 + 0.25n.\n\nPutting that back into the equation:\n\n250 = (n/2) * (13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n500 = n*(13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n500 = 13.75n + 0.25n\u00b2\n\nRearranging terms to form a quadratic equation:\n\n0.25n\u00b2 + 13.75n - 500 = 0\n\nHmm, quadratic equations can be a bit tricky. Let's multiply all terms by 4 to eliminate the decimal. That gives:\n\nn\u00b2 + 55n - 2000 = 0\n\nWait, because 0.25 *4 is 1, 13.75*4 is 55, and 500*4 is 2000. So the equation is n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0.\n\nNow I need to solve for n using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0.\n\nThe quadratic formula is n = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a). Here, a=1, b=55, c=-2000.\n\nCalculating the discriminant first: b\u00b2 -4ac = 55^2 -4*1*(-2000) = 3025 +8000 = 11025.\n\nWhat's the square root of 11025? Let me think. 105 squared is 11025 because 100^2 is 10000, 105^2 is 11025. So sqrt(11025) is 105.\n\nSo n = [-55 \u00b1105]/(2*1) = (50)/(2) or (-160)/(2). Since the number of members can't be negative, we take the positive solution.\n\n50/2 is 25. So n=25.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check the options. Option C is 25. So that's one of the choices. Hmm. But wait, did I make any mistakes in the calculations?\n\nLet me double-check the steps. Starting from the sum formula. Yes, S = n/2 [2a + (n-1)d]. I think that's correct. Then plugging in the numbers: 250 = (n/2)(14 + 0.25(n-1)). Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in expanding.\n\nWait, (n-1)*0.25 is 0.25n -0.25. So 14 +0.25n -0.25 is 13.75 +0.25n. Correct.\n\nThen 250 = (n/2)(13.75 +0.25n). Multiply both sides by 2: 500 = n*(13.75 +0.25n). Expanding: 13.75n +0.25n\u00b2. So 0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n -500=0.\n\nMultiply by 4: n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0. Correct.\n\nQuadratic formula: n = [-55 \u00b1sqrt(55^2 + 4*2000)]/2. Wait, 55^2 is 3025. 4*2000 is 8000. So 3025+8000=11025. sqrt(11025)=105. So n= (-55+105)/2 =50/2=25. Correct.\n\nSo n is 25, which is option C.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option C is 25. So that's the answer. But wait, I should make sure that 25 members with these parameters sum to 250.\n\nLet me compute the sum with n=25. The first term is 7, the last term is 7 + (25-1)*0.25. 24*0.25 is 6. So last term is 13 years. The average age would be (7 +13)/2 =10. Sum is 25*10=250. That matches. So yes, 25 is correct.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a club where the members' ages form an arithmetic progression (AP). The common difference is 3 months. The youngest member is 7 years old, and the total sum of all their ages is 250. I need to find out how many members are in the club. The options are A)18, B)20, C)25, D)26, E)27.\n\nHmm, let me think. First, I remember that in an arithmetic progression, each term increases by a common difference. Here, the difference is 3 months, which is a quarter of a year. So that's 0.25 years. The youngest is 7 years old, so the ages would go 7, 7.25, 7.5, etc., depending on the number of members.\n\nWait, the sum of an AP is given by the formula S = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d], where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as S = n*(a1 + an)/2, where a1 is the first term and an is the last term.\n\nSo I think I can use either formula. Let's define the variables properly. Let me convert everything into years to make it consistent. The common difference d is 0.25 years (since 3 months is a quarter of a year). The first term a is 7 years.\n\nThe sum S is 250 years. So plugging into the formula:\n\nS = n/2 [2a + (n-1)d]\n\nSo 250 = (n/2) * [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n2*7 is 14. Then (n-1)*0.25 is 0.25n - 0.25.\n\nSo the expression becomes 14 + 0.25n - 0.25 = 13.75 + 0.25n.\n\nPutting that back into the equation:\n\n250 = (n/2) * (13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n500 = n*(13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n500 = 13.75n + 0.25n\u00b2\n\nRearranging terms to form a quadratic equation:\n\n0.25n\u00b2 + 13.75n - 500 = 0\n\nHmm, quadratic equations can be a bit tricky. Let's multiply all terms by 4 to eliminate the decimal. That gives:\n\nn\u00b2 + 55n - 2000 = 0\n\nWait, because 0.25 *4 is 1, 13.75*4 is 55, and 500*4 is 2000. So the equation is n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0.\n\nNow I need to solve for n using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0.\n\nThe quadratic formula is n = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a). Here, a=1, b=55, c=-2000.\n\nCalculating the discriminant first: b\u00b2 -4ac = 55^2 -4*1*(-2000) = 3025 +8000 = 11025.\n\nWhat's the square root of 11025? Let me think. 105 squared is 11025 because 100^2 is 10000, 105^2 is 11025. So sqrt(11025) is 105.\n\nSo n = [-55 \u00b1105]/(2*1) = (50)/(2) or (-160)/(2). Since the number of members can't be negative, we take the positive solution.\n\n50/2 is 25. So n=25.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check the options. Option C is 25.

I think that's correct. Then plugging in the numbers: 250 = (n/2)(14 + 0.25(n-1)). Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in expanding.\n\nWait, (n-1)*0.25 is 0.25n -0.25. So 14 +0.25n -0.25 is 13.75 +0.25n. Correct.\n\nThen 250 = (n/2)(13.75 +0.25n). Multiply both sides by 2: 500 = n*(13.75 +0.25n). Expanding: 13.75n +0.25n\u00b2. So 0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n -500=0.\n\nMultiply by 4: n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0. Correct.\n\nQuadratic formula: n = [-55 \u00b1sqrt(55^2 + 4*2000)]/2. Wait, 55^2 is 3025. 4*2000 is 8000. So 3025+8000=11025. sqrt(11025)=105. So n= (-55+105)/2 =50/2=25. Correct.\n\nSo n is 25, which is option C.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option C is 25. So that's the answer. But wait, I should make sure that 25 members with these parameters sum to 250.\n\nLet me compute the sum with n=25. The first term is 7, the last term is 7 + (25-1)*0.25. 24*0.25 is 6.
