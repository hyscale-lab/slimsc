      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where Ram and Krishna start from points A and B, respectively, and they're moving towards each other. Their speeds are 20 m/s and 40 m/s. They meet at point C after 10 seconds, and I need to find the total distance between A and B. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nWait, so both are starting at the same time and moving towards each other. That means they're moving in opposite directions along the same path. So their speeds add up when considering the rate at which the distance between them decreases. Oh right, because when two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds.\n\nSo, Ram's speed is 20 m/s and Krishna's is 40 m/s. So the combined speed is 20 + 40 = 60 m/s. That makes sense because they're approaching each other, so the distance between them is closing at that rate.\n\nThey meet after 10 seconds. So the total distance between A and B should be the combined speed multiplied by the time they took to meet. So that's 60 m/s * 10 s. Let me calculate that: 60 *10 is 600 meters. Wait, that's one of the options. Option E is 600 meters. So that's probably the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. So the distance each covers is their speed multiplied by time. Ram would have covered 20 m/s *10 s = 200 meters. Krishna would have covered 40 m/s *10 s = 400 meters. Adding those together gives 200 + 400 = 600 meters. Yep, that's the same result.

I need to find the total distance between A and B. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. So Ram is going at 20 m/s and Krishna at 40 m/s. So together, they're approaching each other at 20 + 40 = 60 m/s. That makes sense because they're moving towards each other, so their speeds add up.\n\nThey meet after 10 seconds. So the distance they've covered together in those 10 seconds should be equal to the total distance between A and B. Wait, right! Because when they meet, the sum of the distances they've traveled equals the initial distance between A and B.\n\nSo, the formula should be distance = speed \u00d7 time. So total distance D = (20 + 40) m/s \u00d7 10 s. Let me calculate that. 60 m/s multiplied by 10 s is 600 meters. So the total distance between A and B is 600 meters.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 600 meters. So that's the answer. But wait, let me double-check. Did I miss anything?\n\nWait, another approach: Calculate how far each has traveled in 10 seconds and add them. Ram's distance is 20 *10=200m, Krishna's is 40*10=400m. 200 +400=600. Yep, same result.
