      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a bee bypassing flowers. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question says the bee bypasses 0.05% of the flowers it flies by. So, like, for every 100 flowers, it skips 0.05, which is half a flower. Wait, no, 0.05% of 100 is 0.005, which is 0.005 flowers? That doesn't make much sense, but I think percentages can sometimes be tricky.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as the bee only bypasses a small fraction of flowers. So, 0.05% is the same as 0.0005 in decimal form. So, if the bee flies by a certain number of flowers, let's call that number N, then the number of flowers it bypasses is 0.0005 * N. Because 0.05% is 0.0005 in decimal.\n\nThe question is asking, how many flowers will the bee fly by to bypass 8 flowers. So, they want the number N such that 0.0005 * N equals 8. Because the bee skips 8 flowers.\n\nSo, I can set up the equation: 0.0005 * N = 8. To find N, I need to divide both sides by 0.0005. So, N = 8 / 0.0005.\n\nLet me calculate that. 8 divided by 0.0005. Hmm, 0.0005 is the same as 5e-4, right? So, 8 divided by 0.0005 is the same as 8 multiplied by 2000, because 1/0.0005 is 2000.\n\nWait, 1 divided by 0.0005 is 2000, because 0.0005 is 1/2000. So yeah, 8 * 2000 equals 16000. So N is 16,000. Let me check the options.\n\nLooking at the options: A)2000, B)4000, C)8000, D)16000, E)32000. So D is 16000.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If the bee flies by 16000 flowers, how many does it bypass? 0.05% of 16000 is 0.0005 * 16000 = 8. Yeah, that's right. So the answer must be D.\n",

The question says that the bee bypasses 0.05% of the flowers it flies by because it can sense they don't have nectar. Then, the question is, how many flowers will the bee fly by to bypass 8 flowers? Hmm, wait, I need to find the total number of flowers the bee flies by so that out of them, 8 are bypassed.\n\nWait, so 0.05% is the percentage of flowers bypassed. So if the bee flies by N flowers, it bypasses 0.05% of N. And we want that number to be 8. So I think the equation is 0.05% of N equals 8.\n\nLet me write that down. 0.05% as a decimal is 0.0005. So 0.0005 * N = 8. To find N, I need to divide both sides by 0.0005. So N = 8 / 0.0005.\n\nLet me calculate that. 8 divided by 0.0005. Hmm, 0.0005 is the same as 5e-4. So 8 divided by 0.0005 is the same as 8 multiplied by (1/0.0005). What's 1 divided by 0.0005? Well, 0.0005 is 5 per 10,000, so 1/0.0005 is 2000. So 8 * 2000 is 16,000.

And the question is, how many flowers will the bee fly by to bypass 8 flowers?\n\nWait, so the bee skips a certain percentage of flowers.
