      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a cereal mixture. Let me try to understand it. The mixture contains rice, wheat, and corn in the ratio 2:3:5. Hmm, ratios can sometimes be tricky, but I think I get the basics.\n\nThe question says that a bag of this mixture contains 3 pounds of rice. They want to know how much corn is in the bag. Right, so I need to find the amount of corn given the ratio and the known amount of rice.\n\nWait, ratios are about parts. So the ratio 2:3:5 means that for every 2 parts of rice, there are 3 parts of wheat and 5 parts of corn. So the total number of parts is 2 + 3 + 5, which is 10 parts in total.\n\nBut how does that help me find the amount of corn? Oh, right, because each part is equal in weight. So if I can find out how much each part weighs, I can multiply that by the number of parts for corn.\n\nGiven that rice is 2 parts and it's 3 pounds, I can set up an equation. Let me think: 2 parts = 3 pounds. So one part would be 3 divided by 2, which is 1.5 pounds per part.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If 2 parts equal 3 pounds, then each part is 3/2 = 1.5 pounds. That makes sense.\n\nNow, corn is 5 parts. So I multiply the number of parts by the weight per part. So 5 parts * 1.5 pounds per part. Let me calculate that: 5 * 1.5 is 7.5 pounds.\n\nSo the bag should contain 7.5 pounds of corn. Looking at the options, option B is 7.5. So that must be the correct answer.\n\nWait a second, are there any other steps I might have missed? Let me think again. The ratio is 2:3:5, so total parts 10. If 2 parts are rice (3 pounds), each part is 1.5. Corn is 5 parts, so 5*1.5=7.5. Yep, that seems right.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So the answer should be B)7.5.\n",

A bag has 3 pounds of rice, and we need to find out how much corn it contains.\n\nHmm, ratios can sometimes be a bit tricky, but I think I get the basics. Ratios compare the quantities of each component. So here, rice:wheat:corn is 2:3:5. That means for every 2 parts of rice, there are 3 parts of wheat and 5 parts of corn.\n\nWait, so the ratio is 2:3:5. So the total number of parts is 2+3+5. Let me add that up. 2+3 is 5, plus 5 is 10. So there are 10 parts in total.\n\nBut wait, the actual amounts are in pounds. We know that rice is 3 pounds. So rice is 2 parts, and that equals 3 pounds. I think I can set up a proportion here. If 2 parts = 3 pounds, then each part is 3 divided by 2. Let me calculate that: 3/2 is 1.5. So one part equals 1.5 pounds.\n\nNow, the question is about corn, which is 5 parts. So if each part is 1.5 pounds, then 5 parts would be 5 * 1.5. Let me do that multiplication. 5 times 1.5 is 7.5.

So if the ratio is 2:3:5, then the 2 parts correspond to rice. So I think I did it right. So the corn is 5 parts, which is 7.5 pounds. So the correct answer is option B)7.5.\n\n\nThe cereal mixture contains rice, wheat, and corn in the ratio of 2:3:5. This means there are a total of 10 parts (2 + 3 + 5). Rice corresponds to 2 parts, and the problem states that the bag contains 3 pounds of rice. Since 2 parts = 3 pounds, 1 part is equal to \\( \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \\) pounds. Corn corresponds to 5 parts, so the amount of corn is \\( 5 \\times 1.5 = 7.5 \\) pounds. Therefore, the bag contains 7.5 pounds of corn.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a cereal mixture. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says the mixture contains rice, wheat, and corn in the ratio of 2:3:5. And the bag has 3 pounds of rice. I need to find out how much corn it contains. \n\nWait, ratios can sometimes trip me up, but I think I get the basics. Ratios compare the quantities of each component. So, the ratio 2:3:5 means for every 2 parts of rice, there are 3 parts wheat and 5 parts corn. \n\nSo, if the ratio is 2:3:5, that adds up to 2+3+5 = 10 parts total. But wait, that's the total parts, but each part isn't necessarily the same as the actual pounds. So, each part is like a unit of measurement here.\n\nGiven that the bag has 3 pounds of rice. Rice is 2 parts. So, 2 parts = 3 pounds. I can find out what one part equals. \n\nSo, one part would be 3 pounds divided by 2. Let me calculate that: 3 / 2 = 1.5 pounds per part. \n\nNow, since corn is 5 parts, I multiply 5 by 1.5. 5 * 1.5 is... let's see, 5 times 1 is 5, and 5 times 0.5 is 2.5. So, 5 + 2.5 =7.5 pounds. \n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check. The ratio is rice:wheat:corn = 2:3:5. So the total ratio units are 2+3+5=10. But in this problem, I'm not using the total because each part is relative to the given rice. So maybe I don't need the total, because I'm given the rice and can find the per part value.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: Let's think of the ratios as fractions. The fraction of rice in the mixture is 2/(2+3+5) = 2/10 = 1/5. So if the bag has 3 pounds of rice, that's 1/5 of the total mixture. So total mixture would be 3 *5=15 pounds. Then, corn is 5 parts out of 10, so 5/10=1/2. So corn would be (15 pounds) * (5/10) = 7.5 pounds. \n\nWait, that's the same answer as before. So either way, I get 7.5 pounds of corn. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is 7.5. So the answer should be B. But wait, another thought. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the ratios. The ratio is rice:wheat:corn = 2:3:5. So for every 2 units of rice, 3 of wheat and 5 of corn. So 2 units =3 pounds. So 1 unit is 1.5, as before. So corn is 5 units, so 5*1.5=7.5. Yep, that's consistent. \n\nSo the correct answer is B)7.5.\n",
