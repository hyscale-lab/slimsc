      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I have this problem about retail and wholesale prices. Hmm. So, the question is asking what percentage more the appliance was sold compared to its wholesale cost. Let me try to break this down.\n\nAlright, first, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost. So, if the wholesale cost is, say, W, then the retail price R would be W plus 60% of W. Oh right, that's 1.6 times W. So R = 1.6 * W.\n\nThen, the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price. So the selling price S is 20% less than R. That would mean S is 80% of R, because 100% minus 20% is 80%. So S = 0.8 * R.\n\nBut I want to find out how much more S is compared to W. So I need to express S in terms of W.\n\nSince R is 1.6 W, substituting that into S's equation gives S = 0.8 * (1.6 W). Let me calculate that. 0.8 times 1.6 is... let's see, 1.6 * 0.8. Hmm, 1.6 is 16/10, 0.8 is 8/10. So 16 *8 = 128, divided by 100. So 1.28. So S = 1.28 W.\n\nWait, so the selling price is 1.28 times the wholesale cost. That means it's 28% higher than the wholesale cost. Because 1.28 is 128% of W, so the increase is 28%.\n\nLooking at the options, B is 28%, so I think that's the answer.\n",

So, the question is about percentages and figuring out how much more the appliance was sold for compared to its wholesale cost. Hmm.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. The original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost. Wait, so if I call the wholesale cost something like W, then the retail price would be W plus 60% of W. Oh right, 60% more means you take the wholesale cost and add 60% of it. So mathematically, that would be Retail Price = W + 0.6*W, which simplifies to 1.6*W. Got it.\n\nNext part: the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price. So the selling price is 20% less than that 1.6*W. Let me think. If the original retail is 1.6W, then 20% of that would be 0.2 * 1.6W. Subtracting that from the original retail gives the selling price. So Selling Price = 1.6W - 0.2*(1.6W). Let me calculate that.\n\nWait, 0.2 of 1.6 is 0.32. So 1.6W minus 0.32W is (1.6 - 0.32) W. 1.6 minus 0.32 is 1.28.

The original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost. Then, the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price. I need to find out what percent more the selling price is compared to the wholesale cost.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. I think I should start by assigning variables to the different costs to make it clearer. Let's say the wholesale cost is W. Then, the original retail price would be 60% more than that. So, if the wholesale is W, 60% more would be W plus 60% of W, right? That would make the original retail price equal to W multiplied by 1.6. So, Retail = 1.6 * W.\n\nWait, yeah, because 60% is 0.6 in decimal. So, adding that to 1, it's 1.6 times W. Got it.\n\nNow, the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price. So, the selling price is 20% less than Retail. Let me think about that. If the original retail is 1.6W, then 20% off would mean subtracting 20% of Retail from Retail. So, Selling Price = Retail - 0.2 * Retail. That's the same as 0.8 * Retail, right? Because 100% minus 20% is 80%.\n\nSo, substituting Retail, the Selling Price is 0.8 * 1.6W.

So, the increase is 28% above the wholesale price.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, W is the wholesale cost. Retail is 60% higher, so 1.6W. Then, sold for 20% less than that, so 0.8 * 1.6W. 0.8 times 1.6 is indeed 1.28, so 128% of W. So, the selling price is 28% more than W. So the correct answer should be 28%, which is option B.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I do the percentage correctly? Let's see. If the original retail is 1.6W, 20% less than that would be 1.6W minus 0.2*1.6W. 0.2*1.6 is 0.32. So 1.6W - 0.32W is 1.28W. Yep, same result. So that's correct.\n\nSo the answer is B) 28%.\n",

Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. Then, the appliance was sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price. I need to find out what percent more the selling price is compared to the wholesale cost. The options are A)20%, B)28%, C)36%, D)40%, E)42%.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. So, first, the retail price is 60% more than the wholesale cost. Let's call the wholesale cost 'W' and the retail price 'R'. So, R is 60% higher than W. That means R is equal to W plus 60% of W. Which mathematically is R = W + 0.6W, right? So that's R = 1.6W.\n\nThen, the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price. So the selling price, let's call it S, is 20% less than R. So, S = R - 0.2R. Which simplifies to S = 0.8R.\n\nBut wait, I want to find out how much more S is compared to W, the wholesale cost. So, I need to express S in terms of W.\n\nI know that R is 1.6W, so substituting that into S's equation: S = 0.8 * (1.6W). Let me calculate that. 0.8 times 1.6... Hmm, 0.8 * 1.6. Let me think. 1.6 * 0.8 is the same as 1.6 * 8/10, which is 12.8/10 = 1.28. So S = 1.28W.\n\nSo, S is 1.28 times the wholesale cost. That means the selling price is 28% higher than the wholesale cost. Because 0.28 is 28%. So the percentage increase is 28%.\n\nLooking at the options, B is 28%. So the correct answer should be B.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. So, starting with R = 1.6W. Then S = 0.8R = 0.8 * 1.6W. 0.8 * 1.6 is indeed 1.28. So S is 1.28W, which is 28% more than W. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nAnother way to think about it: Let's assume the wholesale cost is $100. Then the retail price is 60% more, so R = 100 + 60 = $160. Then, selling it for 20% less than R would be 160 - (0.2*160) = 160 -32 = $128. So the selling price is $128, which is 28% more than the wholesale cost of $100. So 28% is correct. So the answer is B.\n",

Then, the appliance was sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price. I need to find out what percent more the selling price is compared to the wholesale cost. The options are A)20%, B)28%, C)36%, D)40%, E)42%.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. So, first, the retail price is 60% more than the wholesale cost. Let's call the wholesale cost 'W' and the retail price 'R'. So, R is 60% higher than W. That means R is equal to W plus 60% of W. Which mathematically is R = W + 0.6W, right? So that's R = 1.6W.\n\nThen, the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price. So the selling price, let's call it S, is 20% less than R. So, S = R - 0.2R. Which simplifies to S = 0.8R.\n\nBut wait, I want to find out how much more S is compared to W, the wholesale cost. So, I need to express S in terms of W.\n\nI know that R is 1.6W, so substituting that into S's equation: S = 0.8 * (1.6W). Let me calculate that. 0.8 times 1.6... Hmm, 0.8 * 1.6. Let me think. 1.6 * 0.8 is the same as 1.6 * 8/10, which is 12.8/10 = 1.28. So S = 1.28W.\n\nSo, S is 1.28 times the wholesale cost. That means the selling price is 28% higher than the wholesale cost. Because 0.28 is 28%. So the percentage increase is 28%.\n\nLooking at the options, B is 28%. So the correct answer should be B.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. So, starting with R = 1.6W. Then S = 0.8R = 0.8 * 1.6W. 0.8 * 1.6 is indeed 1.28. So S is 1.28W, which is 28% more than W. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nAnother way to think about it: Let's assume the wholesale cost is $100. Then the retail price is 60% more, so R = 100 + 60 = $160. Then, selling it for 20% less than R would be 160 - (0.2*160) = 160 -32 = $128. So the selling price is $128, which is 28% more than the wholesale cost of $100. So 28% is correct. So the answer is B.\n\n\nThe original retail price \\( R \\) is 60% more than the wholesale cost \\( W \\), so \\( R = 1.6W \\). The appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price, so the selling price \\( S \\) is \\( S = 0.8R \\). Substituting \\( R = 1.6W \\) into this equation gives \\( S = 0.8 \\times 1.6W = 1.28W \\). This means the selling price is 28% higher than the wholesale cost. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: B",

So if the wholesale cost is, say, $100, then the retail price would be 100 plus 60% of 100, which is $160. Wait, I think I should let variables represent these to make it clearer.\n\nLet me define the wholesale cost as W. Then the original retail price would be W plus 60% of W. So that's W * (1 + 0.60) = 1.60 * W. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nNow, the appliance was sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price. Oh right, so the selling price is 20% less than 1.60W. Wait, 20% less means I subtract 20% of the original retail price from it. So the selling price S would be 1.60W minus 20% of 1.60W.\n\nLet me calculate that. 20% of 1.60W is 0.20 * 1.60W = 0.32W. So subtracting that from 1.60W gives S = 1.60W - 0.32W = 1.28W. Oh wait, so the selling price is 1.28 times the wholesale cost.\n\nBut the question is asking, the selling price was what percent more than the wholesale cost? So the wholesale cost is W, and the selling price is 1.28W, which is 28% more than W.\n\nSo the answer should be 28%, which is option B.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. Let me walk through it again.\n\nWholesale cost = W.\nRetail price = W + 60% of W = 1.6W.\nSold for 20% less than retail: so 20% of 1.6W is 0.32W.

I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of percentage problems, but I'll think it through.\n\nAlright, the question says the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost. Hmm, so if I let the wholesale cost be a certain number, say W, then the retail price would be W plus 60% of W. Wait, right, because 60% more means you're adding 60% of the original to itself. So mathematically, Retail Price (R) = W + 0.6*W, which is the same as 1.6*W. Oh, right, because 100% +60% is 160%, so 1.6 times W. Got that.\n\nNext part: the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price. So the selling price is 20% less than R. So if R is the original, then selling price (S) is R minus 20% of R. So that's 0.8*R. Because 100% -20% is 80%, so 0.8 times R.\n\nBut wait, R itself is 1.6*W. So substituting that in, the selling price S would be 0.8*(1.6*W). Let me calculate that. 0.8 times 1.6 is... let's see, 0.8 * 1.6. Hmm, 8 times 16 is 128, so 0.8 *1.6 = 1.28.

Then S is 0.8R, so substituting R gives 0.8*1.6W = 1.28W. So S is 1.28W, which is 28% higher than W. So the answer should be 28%, which is option B.\n\nWait, did I make any mistakes here?
