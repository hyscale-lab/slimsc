      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a picket fence. Hmm, let me read it again. It says a straight picket fence is made of x pickets, each 1/2 inch wide. And there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets. I need to find the length of the fence in feet.\n\nWait, let me visualize this. So imagine a fence with pickets and spaces between them. Each picket is 1/2 inch wide, and the space between each is 6 inches. So for example, if there are two pickets, there's one space between them. If there are three pickets, there are two spaces, right?\n\nSo, the total length of the fence would be the sum of all the picket widths plus all the spaces between them.\n\nLet me break it down. The number of pickets is x, each 1/2 inch. So the total picket width is x multiplied by 1/2. That's (x * 1/2) inches.\n\nNow, the spaces. Since each space is between two pickets, the number of spaces would be one less than the number of pickets. Like, if there are x pickets, there are (x-1) spaces. Each space is 6 inches, so the total space is (x-1)*6 inches.\n\nSo the total length in inches is picket width plus spaces. That's (x*(1/2)) + (x-1)*6.\n\nWait, let me compute that. Let's expand it:\n\nTotal inches = (x/2) + 6(x - 1)\n= (x/2) + 6x -6\nHmm, let me combine like terms. Let's get all the x terms together and the constants together.\n\nx/2 is 0.5x. 6x is 6x. So 0.5x + 6x = 6.5x. Then minus 6.\n\nSo total inches = 6.5x -6.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the length in feet. Oh right, because 1 foot is 12 inches. So I need to convert inches to feet.\n\nSo, to convert inches to feet, divide by 12.\n\nSo total feet = (6.5x -6) / 12.\n\nHmm, let me see. 6.5 is the same as 13/2, right? Because 6.5 = 13/2. So substituting that in:\n\n( (13/2)x -6 ) /12.\n\nWhich is the same as (13x/2 -6) /12.\n\nWait, maybe I can factor that differently. Let me write it as (13x -12)/24. Let's see:\n\nWait, because (13x/2 -6) divided by 12 is same as (13x/2 -6) * (1/12) = (13x)/(2*12) - 6/12.\n\nWhich is 13x/(24) - 0.5.\n\nBut looking at the options, let's see what we have.\n\nOption E is (13x -12)/24. Let's compute that. 13x -12 over 24.\n\nWait, my earlier expression after converting to feet is (13x/24) - (6/12). 6/12 is 0.5, which is 12/24. So:\n\n13x/24 - 12/24 = (13x -12)/24. Oh, so that's the same as option E.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the initial steps because sometimes it's easy to mix up the number of spaces.\n\nSo, x pickets. Number of spaces between pickets is (x-1). Each space is 6 inches. So the total space is 6*(x-1).\n\nEach picket is 1/2 inch, so total picket length is x*(1/2) = x/2 inches.\n\nTotal length in inches: (x/2) + 6*(x-1) = x/2 + 6x -6.\n\nWait, wait, x/2 is 0.5x. 6x is 6x. 0.5x +6x is 6.5x, which is 13x/2. So 13x/2 minus 6 inches.\n\nThen, converting to feet: (13x/2 -6) /12.\n\nLet me compute that fraction:\n\n(13x/2 -6) /12 = (13x -12)/24. Because:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 2 to eliminate the denominator in the first term:\n\nWait, no, perhaps another approach. Let me write 6 as 12/2 so that it's same denominator as 13x/2.\n\nSo 6 is 12/2. So 13x/2 - 12/2 = (13x -12)/2. Then, divided by 12:\n\n(13x -12)/2 divided by 12 is (13x-12)/(2*12) = (13x-12)/24.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer is (13x-12)/24, which is option E.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption E is (13x -12)/24. That matches. So the correct answer is E.\n",

Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details.\n\nThe fence is straight and made up of x pickets. Each picket is 1/2 inch wide. Between each pair of pickets, there are 6 inches of space. I need to find an expression that represents the total length of the fence in feet.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. First, I should probably think about how many spaces there are between the pickets. If there are x pickets, then the number of spaces between them would be one less than x, right? Like, if I have two pickets, there's one space between them. So for x pickets, it's (x - 1) spaces.\n\nEach picket is 1/2 inch wide. So the total width of all the pickets combined is x multiplied by 1/2 inches. Let me write that as (x * 1/2) inches.\n\nEach space is 6 inches, and there are (x-1) spaces. So the total space is (x-1) * 6 inches.\n\nNow, the total length of the fence is the sum of all the picket widths and all the spaces. So that would be (x * 1/2) + [(x - 1) * 6].\n\nLet me calculate that. Expanding the terms:\n\nPickets: (1/2)x\nSpaces: 6(x - 1) = 6x -6\nTotal in inches: (1/2)x + 6x -6.\n\nCombining like terms: (1/2)x +6x is (6.5)x, and then minus 6. So 6.5x -6 inches.\n\nWait, 6.5 is the same as 13/2, right? Because 6 is 12/2, plus 0.5 is 13/2. So the total in inches is (13/2)x -6.\n\nBut the question asks for the length in feet. Oh, right, because inches and feet are different units. There are 12 inches in a foot. So I need to convert the total inches into feet by dividing by 12.\n\nSo the total length in feet is [(13/2)x -6 ] /12.\n\nLet me simplify that. Let's write it as (13x/2 -6)/12. To make it easier, I can split the numerator:\n\n13x/2 divided by 12 is (13x)/(2*12) = 13x/24.\n\nAnd 6 divided by 12 is 0.5, which is 1/2. So putting it together:\n\n(13x/24) - (6/12) = (13x/24) - 0.5.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, I need to see if any of them match this. Let me check each option.\n\nOption A:13x/2. That's much larger than my calculation, so probably not.\n\nOption B:13x/2 -6. That's in inches? Because 13x/2 is like 6.5x, but the subtraction of 6 would be in inches, but we're supposed to have feet. So maybe not. Wait, no, the options are in feet. So I need to see if any of the options equal (13x -12)/24. Wait, let me do the math again.\n\nWait, when I have (13x/2 -6) inches, converting to feet is (13x/2 -6)/12.\n\nWhich is equal to (13x -12)/24. Because:\n\n(13x/2 -6) = (13x -12)/2.\n\nSo when I divide that by 12, it's (13x -12)/(2*12) )= (13x -12)/24.\n\nAh, so that's correct. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOption E is (13x -12)/24. So that would be the correct expression.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial setup. Let's go through it again.\n\nNumber of pickets: x. Each 0.5 inches.

So the total width of all the pickets is x multiplied by 1/2 inch. Let me write that as (x * 1/2) inches.\n\nThen, the spaces: each space is 6 inches, and there are (x-1) of them. So the total space is 6*(x-1) inches.\n\nAdding those two together gives the total length in inches. Then I need to convert that to feet. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, I'll divide the total inches by 12.\n\nPutting it all together: Total inches = (x/2) + 6*(x-1). Then, divide by 12 to get feet.\n\nLet me compute that. Let's expand the equation.\n\nFirst, expand 6*(x-1) = 6x - 6.\n\nSo total inches = (x/2) + 6x -6.\n\nCombining like terms. Let me get all terms in terms of x. So x/2 is the same as 0.5x, and 6x is 6x. So 0.5x +6x is 6.5x. So total inches is 6.5x -6.\n\nWait, 6.5 is the same as 13/2, right? Because 6.5 = 13/2. So 6.5x is 13x/2. So the equation becomes (13x/2) -6 inches.\n\nNow, convert inches to feet: (13x/2 -6) inches divided by 12 inches per foot.\n\nSo, (13x/2 -6) /12 = (13x/2)/12 - 6/12.\n\nSimplify each term. (13x/2) divided by 12 is (13x)/(2*12) = 13x/24.\n\nAnd 6/12 is 0.5, which is 1/2. So the total feet is (13x/24) - (1/2).\n\nHmm, but none of the options directly look like that. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA)13x/2\nB)13x/2 - 6\nC)13x/24\nD)(13x+1)/24\nE)(13x-12)/24\n\nWait, my expression after conversion is (13x/24) - (1/2). Let me see if that can be rewritten.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of spaces. Let me double-check that.\n\nIf there are x pickets, how many spaces are between them? If I have x pickets, the number of gaps between them is x-1. Yeah, that's correct. So 6*(x-1) inches is correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps the original setup was in feet, but the question is to find the length in feet. Let me recheck the steps.\n\nWait, the picket width is 1/2 inch each. So the total for x pickets is x*(1/2) inches. The spaces are 6 inches each, and there's x-1 of them, so 6*(x-1) inches.\n\nTotal length in inches: (x/2) +6(x-1) = x/2 +6x -6.\n\nCombine x terms: x/2 is 0.5x, 6x is 6x. 0.5x +6x=6.5x. So 6.5x -6 inches.\n\nConvert to feet: (6.5x -6) inches /12 = (6.5x -6)/12.\n\n6.5 is 13/2, so (13x/2 -6) divided by 12.\n\nSo (13x/2 -6) /12 = (13x -12)/24.\n\nWait, because when you have (13x/2 -6) divided by 12, it's the same as (13x/2)/12 - 6/12.\n\nWhich is 13x/(2*12) - 6/12 = 13x/24 - 1/2.\n\nWait, but 1/2 is 12/24. So 13x/24 -12/24 = (13x -12)/24.\n\nAh, so the expression simplifies to (13x -12)/24.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is (13x-12)/24. So that's the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, did I make a mistake in the initial calculation? Because the picket widths plus the spaces give the total length.\n\nLet me think again. Let's take x=2 pickets.\n\nEach picket is 1/2 inch, so 2 *0.5=1 inch.\n\nBetween them, 6 inches. So total length is 1 +6=7 inches.\n\nConvert to feet: 7/12 ft.\n\nNow, using option E: (13*2 -12)/24 = (26-12)/24=14/24=7/12. Which matches.\n\nWhat about option A: 13*2 /2=13. 13 inches is 13/12 ft, which is about 1.08 ft, which is longer than 7 inches. So A can't be right.\n\nOption B: 13x/2 -6. For x=2, 13*2/2=13-6=7 inches. So that would be 7 inches, which is correct for x=2. But wait, the problem is in feet. So 7 inches is 7/12 feet. So if I calculate (13x/2 -6)/12, that's (7 inches)/12, which is correct. So option B would give 7 inches, but the question asks for feet, so I need to see if the options represent feet.\n\nWait, the options are all in terms of x, but perhaps the options are in feet, so perhaps I should have kept the units in mind.\n\nWait, the way I approached it: the total in inches is (13x/2 -6), which is in inches. To get feet, I divide by 12. So (13x/2 -6) /12 = (13x-12)/24. Which is option E.\n\nSo for x=2, E gives (26-12)/24=14/24=7/12, correct.\n\nAnother example: x=3.\n\nEach picket is 0.5 inches, so 3 *0.5=1.5 inches.\n\nSpaces: 2 spaces of 6 inches each: 12 inches.\n\nTotal inches: 1.5 +12=13.5 inches.\n\nConvert to feet: 13.5 /12 = 1.125 feet.\n\nNow, option E: (13*3 -12)/24 = (39-12)/24=27/24=9/8=1.125. Correct.\n\nIf I plug into option B: (13*3/2 -6) = (39/2 -6) = 19.5-6=13.5 inches. Which is correct, but the question asks for feet, so 13.5 inches is 13.5/12 =1.125, which is the same as (13*3 -12)/24. So option E is correct.\n\nWait, but looking back, the options are presented as mathematical expressions, not with units. So the options are expressions in feet, so the correct formula is (13x-12)/24.\n\nSo the answer should be option E.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a picket fence, and I'm trying to figure out the length in feet. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details.\n\nSo, the fence is straight, made up of x pickets. Each picket is 1/2 inch wide. And between each pair of pickets, there are 6 inches of space. The question is asking which option represents the total length of the fence in feet.\n\nHmm, alright. I think I need to calculate the total length by adding up the widths of all the pickets and the spaces between them. But wait, how many spaces are there? Because if there are x pickets, then the number of spaces between them is x-1, right? Like, if you have two pickets, there's one space between them.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a picket fence, and I need to find the total length in feet. Let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem says there are x pickets, each 1/2 inch wide. Hmm. So each picket is 0.5 inches in width. And between each pair of pickets, there's 6 inches of space. Wait, so the space is between the pickets, right?\n\nWait, I think I should visualize this. Imagine the fence as a series of pickets with spaces in between. So if there are x pickets, how many spaces are there between them? Oh right, if you have two pickets, there's one space between them. So for x pickets, the number of spaces would be (x - 1). Because the first picket, then a space, then the second picket, and so on until the last one. So the number of spaces is always one less than the number of pickets.\n\nSo each picket is 1/2 inch, so the total width of all pickets combined is x multiplied by 1/2. So that's x*(1/2) inches. Then, each space is 6 inches, and there are (x-1) spaces. So the total space is 6*(x-1) inches.\n\nNow, to get the total length of the fence in inches, I should add the total picket width and the total space. So that's [x*(1/2)] + [6*(x-1)] inches.\n\nWait, let me compute that. So x/2 plus 6(x-1). Let's expand the 6(x-1) term: 6x -6. So the entire expression is x/2 +6x -6. \n\nI should combine like terms. Let's get all the x terms together. x/2 is 0.5x, and 6x is 6.0x. Adding them together gives 6.5x. Then subtract 6. So the total length in inches is 6.5x -6 inches.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the length in feet. Oh right, because 1 foot is 12 inches. So I need to convert inches to feet by dividing by 12.\n\nSo (6.5x -6) inches is equal to (6.5x -6)/12 feet. Hmm. Let me write that as a fraction. 6.5 is the same as 13/2, right? Because 6.5 = 13/2. So 6.5x is (13/2)x. So the equation becomes ( (13/2)x -6 ) /12.\n\nLet me simplify that. Dividing each term by 12:\n\n(13x/(2*12)) - (6/12)\nWhich is (13x/24) - (1/2). \n\nWait, but looking at the options, I don't see that. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA)13x/2\nB)13x/2 -6\nC)13x/24\nD)(13x+1)/24\nE)(13x-12)/24\n\nHmm, none of the options exactly match (13x/24 - 1/2). Let me think. Maybe I made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nWait, let me go back. Maybe I should approach the problem differently. \n\nTotal length in inches is (number of pickets * picket width) + (number of spaces * space width).\n\nNumber of pickets = x, each 0.5 inches: x*(0.5) = 0.5x inches.\n\nNumber of spaces = (x-1), each 6 inches: (x-1)*6 inches.\n\nTotal length in inches: 0.5x +6(x-1) = 0.5x +6x -6 = (6.5x -6) inches.\n\nConvert to feet: (6.5x -6) /12 feet. \n\nLet me compute 6.5x as 13x/2. So (13x/2 -6) /12.\n\nWhich is (13x/2 -6) multiplied by 1/12. So:\n\n(13x/2) * (1/12) = 13x/(24)\n6 * (1/12) = 0.5 or 1/2.\n\nSo the expression is (13x/24) - (1/2). But none of the options match this. So perhaps I should represent this as a single fraction.\n\nLet me write it as (13x - 12)/24. Because:\n\n13x/24 -12/24 = (13x -12)/24.\n\nAh, right! Because 1/2 is 12/24. So subtracting 12/24 from 13x/24 gives (13x -12)/24.\n\nLooking back at the options, option E is (13x -12)/24. So that must be the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. \n\nSo, let's check:\n\nTotal picket width: x * 0.5 inches.\n\nTotal spaces: (x-1) *6 inches.\n\nTotal in inches: 0.5x +6x -6 = 6.5x -6. Correct.\n\nConvert to feet: (6.5x -6) /12 = (13x/2 -6)/12 = (13x/24) - (6/12) = (13x/24) - 0.5.\n\nExpressing 0.5 as 12/24, so 13x/24 -12/24 = (13x -12)/24. Which is option E.\n",

Imagine the fence as a series of pickets with spaces in between. So if there are x pickets, how many spaces are there between them? Oh right, if you have two pickets, there's one space between them. So for x pickets, the number of spaces would be (x - 1). Because the first picket, then a space, then the second picket, and so on until the last one. So the number of spaces is always one less than the number of pickets.\n\nSo each picket is 1/2 inch, so the total width of all pickets combined is x multiplied by 1/2. So that's x*(1/2) inches. Then, each space is 6 inches, and there are (x-1) spaces. So the total space is 6*(x-1) inches.\n\nNow, to get the total length of the fence in inches, I should add the total picket width and the total space. So that's [x*(1/2)] + [6*(x-1)] inches.\n\nWait, let me compute that. So x/2 plus 6(x-1). Let's expand the 6(x-1) term: 6x -6. So the entire expression is x/2 +6x -6. \n\nI should combine like terms. Let's get all the x terms together. x/2 is 0.5x, and 6x is 6.0x. Adding them together gives 6.5x. Then subtract 6. So the total length in inches is 6.5x -6 inches.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the length in feet. Oh right, because 1 foot is 12 inches. So I need to convert inches to feet by dividing by 12.\n\nSo (6.5x -6) inches is equal to (6.5x -6)/12 feet. Hmm. Let me write that as a fraction. 6.5 is the same as 13/2, right? Because 6.5 = 13/2. So 6.5x is (13/2)x. So the equation becomes ( (13/2)x -6 ) /12.\n\nLet me simplify that. Dividing each term by 12:\n\n(13x/(2*12)) - (6/12)\nWhich is (13x/24) - (1/2). \n\nWait, but looking at the options, I don't see that. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA)13x/2\nB)13x/2 -6\nC)13x/24\nD)(13x+1)/24\nE)(13x-12)/24\n\nHmm, none of the options exactly match (13x/24 - 1/2). Let me think. Maybe I made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nWait, let me go back. Maybe I should approach the problem differently. \n\nTotal length in inches is (number of pickets * picket width) + (number of spaces * space width).\n\nNumber of pickets = x, each 0.5 inches: x*(0.5) = 0.5x inches.\n\nNumber of spaces = (x-1), each 6 inches: (x-1)*6 inches.\n\nTotal length in inches: 0.5x +6(x-1) = 0.5x +6x -6 = (6.5x -6) inches.\n\nConvert to feet: (6.5x -6) /12 feet. \n\nLet me compute 6.5x as 13x/2. So (13x/2 -6) /12.\n\nWhich is (13x/2 -6) multiplied by 1/12. So:\n\n(13x/2) * (1/12) = 13x/(24)\n6 * (1/12) = 0.5 or 1/2.\n\nSo the expression is (13x/24) - (1/2). But none of the options match this. So perhaps I should represent this as a single fraction.\n\nLet me write it as (13x - 12)/24. Because:\n\n13x/24 -12/24 = (13x -12)/24.\n\nAh, right! Because 1/2 is 12/24. So subtracting 12/24 from 13x/24 gives (13x -12)/24.\n\nLooking back at the options, option E is (13x -12)/24. So that must be the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. \n\nSo, let's check:\n\nTotal picket width: x * 0.5 inches.\n\nTotal spaces: (x-1) *6 inches.\n\nTotal in inches: 0.5x +6x -6 = 6.5x -6. Correct.\n\nConvert to feet: (6.5x -6) /12 = (13x/2 -6)/12 = (13x/24) - (6/12) = (13x/24) - 0.5.\n\nExpressing 0.5 as 12/24, so 13x/24 -12/24 = (13x -12)/24. Which is option E.\n\n\nTo determine the length of the fence in feet, we start by calculating the total length in inches. Each picket is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\, \\text{inch} \\) wide, and there are \\( x \\) pickets, so the total width of the pickets is:\n\n\\[\nx \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{x}{2} \\, \\text{inches}.\n\\]\n\nThere are \\( x - 1 \\) spaces between the pickets, each \\( 6 \\, \\text{inches} \\) wide, so the total width of the spaces is:\n\n\\[\n(x - 1) \\cdot 6 = 6x - 6 \\, \\text{inches}.\n\\]\n\nAdding the total width of the pickets and spaces gives the total length in inches:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{2} + 6x - 6 = 6.5x - 6 \\, \\text{inches}.\n\\]\n\nTo convert this to feet, divide by \\( 12 \\) (since \\( 1 \\, \\text{foot} = 12 \\, \\text{inches} \\)):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6.5x - 6}{12} \\, \\text{feet}.\n\\]\n\nExpressing \\( 6.5 \\) as \\( \\frac{13}{2} \\), the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{13}{2}x - 6}{12} = \\frac{13x}{24} - \\frac{6}{12}.\n\\]\n\nSimplifying further:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{13x}{24} - \\frac{1}{2}.\n\\]\n\nTo combine the terms into a single fraction, note that \\( \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{12}{24} \\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{13x}{24} - \\frac{12}{24} = \\frac{13x - 12}{24}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the length of the fence in feet is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{13x - 12}{24}.\n\\]\n\nComparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:\n\n**E) \\( \\frac{13x - 12}{24} \\).**\n\nAnswer: E",

Each picket is half an inch wide. And between each pair of pickets, there are 6 inches of space. I need to find the total length in feet. \n\nWait, I should probably start by visualizing this. So imagine the fence: it's a straight line of pickets. Each picket is 0.5 inches wide. Between each picket, there's a 6-inch gap. So the pattern is picket, space, picket, space, and so on.\n\nBut wait, how many spaces are there if there are x pickets? Oh right, if there are x pickets, there must be (x-1) spaces between them. Because the first picket doesn't have a space before it, and each subsequent picket adds a space after the previous one. So for example, if there are 2 pickets, there's 1 space between them. So yeah, x-1 spaces.\n\nSo the total length contributed by the pickets is x times the width of each picket. Each picket is 0.5 inches, so that's x * 0.5 inches.\n\nThe total length of the spaces is the number of spaces multiplied by the space's width. Each space is 6 inches, so that's (x-1) * 6 inches.\n\nSo the total length in inches would be the sum of these two: (0.5x) + 6(x-1).\n\nLet me write that out: 0.5x + 6(x-1) = 0.5x +6x -6. Combining like terms: 0.5x +6x is 6.5x. So 6.5x -6 inches.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the length in feet. Oh right, because 1 foot is 12 inches. So I need to convert inches to feet by dividing by 12.\n\nSo total length in feet is (6.5x -6)/12.\n\nLet me simplify that. 6.5 is the same as 13/2, so 6.5x is (13x)/2. So the numerator becomes (13x/2 -6). Dividing by 12 is the same as multiplying by 1/12, so:\n\n(13x/2 -6) / 12. Hmm, let's write that as (13x/2 -6) * (1/12). Which is (13x/24 -6/12). 6/12 is 0.5, which is 1/2. So the expression becomes (13x/24) - (1/2).\n\nWait, but looking at the options, I don't see that exact expression.

Let me go back.\n\nWait, when I converted the total inches to feet, I had (6.5x -6) inches. So to get feet, I divide by 12: (6.5x -6)/12. Let's compute that.\n\n6.5x divided by 12 is (6.5 / 12)x. 6.5 is 13/2, so (13/2)/12 is 13/(2*12) =13/24. So the first term is (13x)/24.\n\nThe second term is -6/12, which is -0.5, which is -1/2. So the total is (13x/24) - (1/2).\n\nWait, but none of the options match that. Hmm. Let's think again. Maybe I should factor the expression differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should not have converted each part but kept it as inches first. So total length in inches is 0.5x +6(x-1) =0.5x +6x -6 =6.5x -6. So 6.5x -6 inches.\n\nTo convert to feet, divide by 12: (6.5x -6)/12.\n\nAlternatively, 6.5 is 13/2, so that's (13x/2 -6)/12. Which can be written as (13x -12)/24. Because when you have (a - b)/c, that's a/c - b/c. So (13x/2 -6)/12 is equal to 13x/(2*12) -6/12 =13x/24 - 0.5. But wait, another approach: (13x/2 -6) divided by 12 is (13x -12)/24, because multiply numerator and denominator by 2: (13x/2 -6) * (1/12) = (13x -12)/24.\n\nWait, that's correct. Because (13x/2 -6) equals (13x -12)/2. So when I divide that by 12, it's (13x -12)/(2*12) )= (13x -12)/24. So the total length is (13x -12)/24 feet.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is (13x-12)/24. So that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Let's take a small example. Suppose x is 1. Then, there's only one picket, so no spaces. The length should be 0.5 inches, which is 0.5/12 = 1/24 feet.\n\nPlugging x=1 into option E: (13(1) -12)/24 = (13-12)/24=1/24. Correct.\n\nAnother example: x=2. Two pickets, so one space of 6 inches. So total inches: 2*(0.5) +1*6 = 1 +6=7 inches. 7 inches is 7/12 feet.\n\nUsing option E: (13*2 -12)/24 = (26-12)/24=14/24=7/12. Correct.\n\nAnother example: x=3. Three pickets, two spaces. 3*0.5=1.5 inches. 2*6=12 inches. Total 13.5 inches. 13.5 /12 =1.125 feet.\n\nOption E: (39-12)/24=27/24=9/8=1.125. Correct.\n\nSo yeah, option E is correct.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a picket fence. Hmm, I need to find the length of the fence in feet. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details right.\n\nAlright, the fence is straight and made up of x pickets. Each picket is 1/2 inch wide. Oh, and there's 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets. I need to figure out the total length in feet.\n\nWait, so each picket is 0.5 inches wide. And between each picket, there's 6 inches of space. But wait, how many spaces are there between the pickets? Oh right, if there are x pickets, then the number of spaces between them is (x - 1). Because if you have two pickets, there's one space between them. Three pickets have two spaces, and so on.\n\nSo the total length contributed by the pickets themselves would be x times 0.5 inches. Because each picket is 0.5 inches wide. And the total space between them would be (x - 1) times 6 inches. Because each space is 6 inches, and there's one less space than the number of pickets.\n\nSo the total length in inches would be the sum of the pickets and the spaces. Let me write that down:\n\nTotal inches = (x * 0.5) + ((x - 1) * 6)\n\nLet me compute that. Let's expand the terms.\n\nFirst term: x * 0.5 = 0.5x\nSecond term: (x-1)*6 = 6x -6\n\nSo adding them together: 0.5x + 6x -6 = (0.5 +6)x -6 = 6.5x -6 inches.\n\nWait, 0.5x plus 6x is 6.5x, right. And then minus 6.\n\nBut wait, 6.5 is the same as 13/2. Oh, because 6.5 is 13 divided by 2. So 6.5x is (13x)/2. So the total inches would be (13x)/2 -6.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the length in feet, not inches. So I need to convert inches to feet. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, I'll divide the total inches by 12.\n\nSo total feet = [ (13x/2) -6 ] / 12\n\nLet me compute that. Let's write it as (13x/2 -6) divided by 12.\n\nHmm, that's the same as (13x/2 -6) multiplied by (1/12). Let me compute each term separately.\n\n13x/2 divided by 12 is (13x)/(2*12) = (13x)/24.\n\nAnd 6 divided by 12 is 0.5, but since it's minus 6, it becomes minus 6/12, which is minus 0.5.\n\nWait, but wait, when I have [a - b]/c, it's the same as a/c - b/c.\n\nSo, (13x/2)/12 - 6/12.\n\nWhich is (13x)/(2*12) ) - (6/12) = (13x/24) - 0.5.\n\nHmm, but none of the options seem to match that. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) 13x/2 \u2014 that's in inches, I think. Because that's the same as 6.5x, which in inches.\n\nBut the question is asking for feet, so A is in inches, so probably not.\n\nOption B: 13x/2 -6. Again, that's inches because the units would be same as A, and subtracting 6 inches. So B is in inches. So not the right unit.\n\nC) 13x/24 \u2014 this is in feet, because 13x/24 is (6.5x)/12, which is inches converted to feet.\n\nWait, but my calculation had (13x/24) - 0.5 feet. So that's different from option C.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me go back. Maybe I should have considered the entire expression correctly.\n\nWait, maybe I should express the total length in feet directly. Let me think again.\n\nEach picket is 0.5 inches, which is 0.5/12 feet. Because 12 inches in a foot.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a picket fence. Hmm, I need to find the length of the fence in feet. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details right.\n\nAlright, the fence is straight and made up of x pickets. Each picket is 1/2 inch wide. Oh, and there's 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets. I need to figure out the total length in feet.\n\nWait, so each picket is 0.5 inches wide. And between each picket, there's 6 inches of space. But wait, how many spaces are there between the pickets? Oh right, if there are x pickets, then the number of spaces between them is (x - 1). Because if you have two pickets, there's one space between them. Three pickets have two spaces, and so on.\n\nSo the total length contributed by the pickets themselves would be x times 0.5 inches. Because each picket is 0.5 inches wide. And the total space between them would be (x - 1) times 6 inches. Because each space is 6 inches, and there's one less space than the number of pickets.\n\nSo the total length in inches would be the sum of the pickets and the spaces. Let me write that down:\n\nTotal inches = (x * 0.5) + ((x - 1) * 6)\n\nLet me compute that. Let's expand the terms.\n\nFirst term: x * 0.5 = 0.5x\nSecond term: (x-1)*6 = 6x -6\n\nSo adding them together: 0.5x + 6x -6 = (0.5 +6)x -6 = 6.5x -6 inches.\n\nWait, 0.5x plus 6x is 6.5x, right. And then minus 6.\n\nBut wait, 6.5 is the same as 13/2. Oh, because 6.5 is 13 divided by 2. So 6.5x is (13x)/2. So the total inches would be (13x)/2 -6.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the length in feet, not inches. So I need to convert inches to feet. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, I'll divide the total inches by 12.\n\nSo total feet = [ (13x/2) -6 ] / 12\n\nLet me compute that. Let's write it as (13x/2 -6) divided by 12.\n\nHmm, that's the same as (13x/2 -6) multiplied by (1/12). Let me compute each term separately.\n\n13x/2 divided by 12 is (13x)/(2*12) = (13x)/24.\n\nAnd 6 divided by 12 is 0.5, but since it's minus 6, it becomes minus 6/12, which is minus 0.5.\n\nWait, but wait, when I have [a - b]/c, it's the same as a/c - b/c.\n\nSo, (13x/2)/12 - 6/12.\n\nWhich is (13x)/(2*12) ) - (6/12) = (13x/24) - 0.5.\n\nHmm, but none of the options seem to match that. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) 13x/2 \u2014 that's in inches, I think. Because that's the same as 6.5x, which in inches.\n\nBut the question is asking for feet, so A is in inches, so probably not.\n\nOption B: 13x/2 -6. Again, that's inches because the units would be same as A, and subtracting 6 inches. So B is in inches. So not the right unit.\n\nC) 13x/24 \u2014 this is in feet, because 13x/24 is (6.5x)/12, which is inches converted to feet.\n\nWait, but my calculation had (13x/24) - 0.5 feet. So that's different from option C.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me go back. Maybe I should have considered the entire expression correctly.\n\nWait, maybe I should express the total length in feet directly. Let me think again.\n\nEach picket is 0.5 inches, which is 0.5/12 feet. Because 12 inches in a foot. So 0.5 inches is (0.5)/12 = 1/24 feet.\n\nEach space is 6 inches, which is 6/12 = 0.5 feet.\n\nSo the total length is x * (1/24) + (x -1) * 0.5.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nx*(1/24) = x/24\n\n(x-1)*0.5 = 0.5x - 0.5\n\nAdding them: x/24 + 0.5x -0.5.\n\nBut 0.5x is the same as (12x)/24. Because 0.5 is 12/24.\n\nWait, no, 0.5 is 12/24? Wait, 0.5 is 1/2, which is 12/24. Yes.\n\nSo 0.5x = (12x)/24.\n\nSo x/24 + (12x)/24 = (13x)/24.\n\nThen minus 0.5.\n\nSo the total is (13x)/24 - 0.5.\n\nHmm, that's the same as before.\n\nWait, but 0.5 is 12/24, so 13x/24 - 12/24 = (13x -12)/24.\n\nSo the total length is (13x -12)/24 feet.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is (13x-12)/24.\n\nWait, so that would be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nTotal length in inches: (x * 0.5) + ((x-1)*6) = 0.5x +6x -6 =6.5x -6 inches.\n\nConvert to feet: (6.5x -6)/12 = (13x/2 -6)/12 = (13x -12)/24.\n\nYes, same as before. So the answer is E.\n\nWait, let me make sure none of the other options match.\n\nOption E is (13x -12)/24.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a picket fence. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question says: A straight picket fence is composed of x pickets, each of which is 1/2 inch wide. There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets. I need to find the length of the fence in feet. The options are given as A to E.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. So, the fence is made up of x pickets. Each picket is 1/2 inch wide. And between every two pickets, there's 6 inches of space. I have to calculate the total length, but the answer needs to be in feet, not inches. Oh right, because 1 foot is 12 inches, so I'll probably have to convert inches to feet at the end.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how much space each picket and the space between them take. Let's think about the structure. If there are x pickets, how many spaces are there between them? Well, if I have two pickets, there's one space between them. For three pickets, two spaces. So, the number of spaces is always one less than the number of pickets. So spaces = x - 1.\n\nEach picket is 1/2 inch wide. So the total width taken by the pickets is x multiplied by 1/2 inch. That would be (x * 1/2) inches.\n\nEach space is 6 inches, and there are (x-1) spaces. So the total space is 6*(x-1) inches.\n\nSo the total length of the fence in inches is the sum of the picket widths and the spaces. That would be:\n\nTotal length (inches) = (x * 1/2) + (6*(x-1)).\n\nLet me write that out:\n\nTotal inches = (0.5x) + 6(x - 1)\n\nSimplify that equation. Let's compute each part:\n\n0.5x + 6x - 6.\n\nCombining like terms: 0.5x +6x is 6.5x, so 6.5x -6.\n\nWait, 6.5x is the same as 13x/2, because 6.5 is 13/2. So 13x/2 -6.\n\nSo the total in inches is (13x/2 -6) inches. But the question asks for the length in feet, so I need to convert inches to feet.\n\nSince 1 foot is 12 inches, I'll divide the total inches by 12 to get feet.\n\nSo total feet = (13x/2 -6) / 12.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n(13x/2 -6) divided by 12 is the same as (13x/2)/12 - 6/12.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n(13x/2) / 12 = 13x/(2*12) = 13x/24.\n\n6/12 is 0.5, which is 1/2. So the second term is 1/2.\n\nSo the expression becomes (13x/24) - (1/2).\n\nHmm, but looking at the options, I don't see this exact expression. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA)13x/2\n\nB)13x/2 -6\n\nC)13x/24\n\nD)(13x+1)/24\n\nE)(13x-12)/24\n\nWait, so the options are in terms of feet, I think. Because B is in inches (since it's 13x/2 inches minus 6 inches). So the correct answer should be in feet, so let's see.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should have converted each part to feet before adding. Let me try that approach.\n\nEach picket is 1/2 inch. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, 1/2 inch is (1/2)/12 feet. That's 1/(24) feet per picket. So x pickets would be x*(1/24) feet.\n\nEach space is 6 inches, which is 6/12 = 0.5 feet. There are (x-1) spaces, so total space is 0.5*(x-1) feet.\n\nSo total length in feet is:\n\n(x*(1/24)) + (0.5*(x-1)).\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n= (x/24) + (0.5x - 0.5)\n\n= x/24 + (12x/24 - 12/24) [since 0.5 is 12/24]\n\nWait, 0.5 is 1/2, which is 12/24? No, wait 1/2 is 12/24? Wait, 1/2 is 12/24? Wait, 24 is the denominator. 1/2 is 12/24. Yes.\n\nWait, no. 1/2 is 12/24? Wait, 24 times 0.5 is 12. So yes, 0.5 = 12/24.\n\nSo 0.5*(x-1) = (12x/24 - 12/24).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nTotal feet = x/24 + (12x/24 - 12/24)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx/24 +12x/24 = (13x)/24\n\nThen subtract 12/24:\n\n(13x/24) - (12/24)\n\nWhich simplifies to (13x -12)/24.\n\nLooking back at the options, option E is (13x-12)/24.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated in inches and converted, I had (13x/2 -6)/12 = (13x/24 - 6/12) = (13x/24 - 0.5). But 0.5 is 12/24, so 13x/24 -12/24 is (13x -12)/24, which matches option E.\n\nSo the correct answer should be E.\n\nWait, but I thought the first approach was correct, but why do I get E as the answer.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's compute for a small x.\n\nSuppose x=1. Then the fence is just one picket, 0.5 inches, which is 0.5/12 = 1/24 feet. So the length is 1/24 feet.\n\nNow, let's plug x=1 into each option.\n\nOption E: (13*1 -12)/24 = (1)/24 = 1/24. Correct.\n\nAnother test: x=2.\n\nTwo pickets, each 0.5 inch, so 1 inch wide. Between them is 6 inches. So total length is 1+6=7 inches.\n\nConvert to feet: 7/12 feet.\n\nCompute each option for x=2.\n\nOption A: 13*2/2 =13. 13 feet? No, way too big.\n\nOption B: 13*2/2 -6 =13 -6=7 inches? Wait, 7 inches is correct. But the answer needs to be in feet. So 7 inches is 7/12 feet. So option B gives 7 inches, but the problem asks for feet. So B is in inches, not feet, so not correct.\n\nOption C: 13*2/24=26/24=13/12 \u2248 1.083 feet. Which is incorrect, as actual is 7/12\u22480.583.\n\nOption D: (26+1)/24=27/24=9/8=1.125. No.\n\nOption E: (26-12)/24=14/24=7/12. Correct.\n\nSo yes, for x=2, E gives the correct answer of 7/12 feet.\n\nAnother test: x=3.\n\nPickets: 3 *0.5=1.5 inches.\n\nSpaces: 2 *6=12 inches.\n\nTotal length:1.5+12=13.5 inches = 13.5/12 = 1.125 feet.\n\nOption E: (13*3 -12)/24= (39-12)/24=27/24=9/8=1.125. Correct.\n\nSo yes, option E is correct.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a picket fence. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question says: A straight picket fence is composed of x pickets, each of which is 1/2 inch wide. There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets. I need to find the length of the fence in feet. The options are given as A to E.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. So, the fence is made up of x pickets. Each picket is 1/2 inch wide. And between every two pickets, there's 6 inches of space. I have to calculate the total length, but the answer needs to be in feet, not inches. Oh right, because 1 foot is 12 inches, so I'll probably have to convert inches to feet at the end.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how much space each picket and the space between them take. Let's think about the structure. If there are x pickets, how many spaces are there between them? Well, if I have two pickets, there's one space between them. For three pickets, two spaces. So, the number of spaces is always one less than the number of pickets. So spaces = x - 1.\n\nEach picket is 1/2 inch wide. So the total width taken by the pickets is x multiplied by 1/2 inch. That would be (x * 1/2) inches.\n\nEach space is 6 inches, and there are (x-1) spaces. So the total space is 6*(x-1) inches.\n\nSo the total length of the fence in inches is the sum of the picket widths and the spaces. That would be:\n\nTotal length (inches) = (x * 1/2) + (6*(x-1)).\n\nLet me write that out:\n\nTotal inches = (0.5x) + 6(x - 1)\n\nSimplify that equation. Let's compute each part:\n\n0.5x + 6x - 6.\n\nCombining like terms: 0.5x +6x is 6.5x, so 6.5x -6.\n\nWait, 6.5x is the same as 13x/2, because 6.5 is 13/2. So 13x/2 -6.\n\nSo the total in inches is (13x/2 -6) inches. But the question asks for the length in feet, so I need to convert inches to feet.\n\nSince 1 foot is 12 inches, I'll divide the total inches by 12 to get feet.\n\nSo total feet = (13x/2 -6) / 12.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n(13x/2 -6) divided by 12 is the same as (13x/2)/12 - 6/12.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n(13x/2) / 12 = 13x/(2*12) = 13x/24.\n\n6/12 is 0.5, which is 1/2.
