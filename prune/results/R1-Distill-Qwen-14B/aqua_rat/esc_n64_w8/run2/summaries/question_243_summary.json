      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says. It says, \"If one third of 3/4 of a number is 21. Then, find the number?\" And there are five options to choose from.\n\nHmm, I think I need to translate this sentence into a mathematical equation. Let me break it down. The number is unknown, so I'll call it 'x' or maybe 'n'. Let's say 'n' for number. \n\nThe problem says one third of 3/4 of n is 21. So, first, I should find 3/4 of n, and then take one third of that result. That equals 21. \n\nWait, maybe I should write it out. So, 3/4 of n is (3/4)*n. Then, one third of that is (1/3) * (3/4)*n. And that equals 21. \n\nLet me write that equation down: (1/3) * (3/4) * n = 21. \n\nHmm, maybe I can simplify this equation. Let's see, the 1/3 and 3/4 can be multiplied together. So, 1/3 times 3/4 is... Let's compute that. 1 times 3 is 3, and 3 times 4 is 12. So, 3/12 simplifies to 1/4. Oh wait, because 3 divided by 12 is 0.25, which is 1/4. So, the equation becomes (1/4)*n = 21.\n\nSo, (1/4)*n = 21. To find n, I need to get rid of the 1/4 that's multiplied by it. How do I do that? I think I should multiply both sides of the equation by 4. \n\nSo, multiplying both sides by 4: 4*(1/4)*n = 4*21. The 4 and 1/4 on the left cancel each other out, leaving just n. And 4 times 21 is 84. So, n = 84. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Let me substitute 84 back into the original problem to make sure it works. \n\nSo, 3/4 of 84 is (3/4)*84. Let me calculate that. 84 divided by 4 is 21, multiplied by 3 is 63. So, 3/4 of 84 is 63. Now, one third of 63 is 63/3, which is 21. Yep, that matches the problem statement.

It's talking about a number, let's call it 'x'. The problem states that one third of three fourths of this number equals 21. So, in equation form, that would be (1/3) of (3/4 of x) = 21.\n\nWait, let me write that out to make it clearer. So, (1/3) * (3/4 x) = 21. Oh wait, the \"of\" in math usually translates to multiplication. Right, so that's correct.\n\nNow, simplifying this equation. Let's see, (1/3) multiplied by (3/4 x). Let's compute the coefficients first. 1/3 times 3/4. Let me do the math: 1 times 3 is 3, and 3 times 4 is 12. So that's 3/12. Wait, 3/12 can be simplified, right?

The problem involves fractions of a number. Let's denote the unknown number as 'x'. The statement says one third of 3/4 of x is equal to 21. So, I should translate this into an equation.\n\nWait, the way to write that would be: (1/3) of (3/4 of x) equals 21. So, in mathematical terms, that's (1/3) * (3/4) * x = 21.

Let me break it down step by step. \n\nThe problem says one third of 3/4 of a number equals 21. So, let's represent the number as 'x'. \n\nFirst, I think I should translate the words into mathematical operations. \"3/4 of a number\" would be (3/4)*x. Then, \"one third of that\" would be (1/3) multiplied by (3/4 x). \n\nSo putting it all together, the equation would be:\n\n(1/3) * (3/4) * x = 21.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm getting the order right. One third of (3/4 of x). So yes, that's correct. \n\nNow, I can simplify this equation. Let's compute the multiplication of the fractions first. (1/3) multiplied by (3/4) is equal to (1*3)/(3*4) = 3/12. Wait, 3/12 simplifies to 1/4. Oh, that's easier. So the equation becomes:\n\n(1/4) * x = 21.\n\nSo, (x/4) = 21. To find x, I need to multiply both sides by 4. That would give x = 21 * 4.\n\nCalculating that, 21 times 4 is 84. So the number is 84. Looking at the options, A is 84. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nSo, (1/3) of (3/4 x) equals 21. Let me compute (1/3)*(3/4). The 3 in the numerator and denominator cancel out, leaving 1/4. So yes, 1/4 x =21. Multiply both sides by 4, x=84. Yep, that's right.\n\nI think I got it right. So the correct option is A)84.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let the number be \\( x \\). The problem states that one third of 3/4 of \\( x \\) is 21. This can be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{4} \\times x = 21\n\\]\n\nSimplify the fractions:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{1 \\times 3}{3 \\times 4} = \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} \\times x = 21\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = 21 \\times 4 = 84\n\\]\n\nThus, the number is 84, which corresponds to option A.\n\nAnswer: A",

Let me compute that. \n\nMultiplying 1/3 and 3/4. Let's see, the 3 in the numerator of the first fraction and the 3 in the denominator of the second fraction will cancel out. So, 1/3 * 3/4 is (1*3)/(3*4) which simplifies. The 3s cancel, so it becomes 1/4. So, (1/3)*(3/4) = 1/4.\n\nSo the equation becomes (1/4)x = 21. Now, to find x, I need to solve for it. Since (1/4)x equals 21, I can multiply both sides by 4 to get x by itself.\n\nSo, x = 21 * 4. Let me calculate that. 21 times 4 is 84. So x equals 84. \n\nLooking at the options, option A is 84.

First, it says one third of 3/4 of the number. So, let me parse that.\n\nWait, so it's one third multiplied by 3/4 of x. Or is it the other way around? No, I think it's correct. So, the expression would be (1/3) * (3/4) * x equals 21. Because \"one third of 3/4 of x\" translates to (1/3) multiplied by (3/4 x).\n\nLet me write that down as an equation: (1/3) * (3/4)x = 21.\n\nWait, maybe I should simplify that. Let me compute the fractions first. So, 1/3 multiplied by 3/4. Let's see, 1 times 3 is 3, and 3 times 4 is 12. So, 3/12. Oh, wait, 3/12 simplifies to 1/4. Because 3 divided by 3 is 1, and 12 divided by 3 is 4. So, 3/12 is 1/4. So, that simplifies the equation to (1/4)x = 21.\n\nWait, is that right? Because (1/3)*(3/4) is (3)/(12) which is 1/4. So yes, (1/4)x =21.\n\nSo, to find x, I need to solve for x. So, x equals 21 multiplied by 4. Because 1/4 of x is 21, so x is four times that. Let me calculate that. 21 *4 is 84. So, x is 84.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 84. So, the answer should be A.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The problem is one third of 3/4 of a number. So, (1/3) * (3/4)x. Let me compute that again. 1/3 times 3/4 is (1*3)/(3*4) which is 3/12. 3/12 simplifies to 1/4. So, 1/4 x is 21. Multiply both sides by 4, x is 84. Yep, that's correct. So, the answer is 84, which is option A.\n\n\nThe problem states that one third of 3/4 of a number is 21. Let the number be \\( x \\). \n\nFirst, translate the statement into an equation:  \n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{4} \\times x = 21\n\\]\n\nSimplify the fractions:  \n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nThis reduces the equation to:  \n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4}x = 21\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), multiply both sides by 4:  \n\\[\nx = 21 \\times 4 = 84\n\\]\n\nThus, the number is 84, which corresponds to option A.\n\nAnswer: A",
