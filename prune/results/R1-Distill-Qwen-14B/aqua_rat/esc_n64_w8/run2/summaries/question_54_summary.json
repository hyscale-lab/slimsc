      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about oranges in a basket. Let me read it again. The question says, \"There are 10 oranges in a basket. Find the number of ways in which 2 oranges are chosen from the basket?\" And then there are five options to choose from: A)45, B)90, C)120, D)150, E)180.\n\nHmm, I remember this is a combinatorics problem. Combinatorics deals with counting, right? So when we're choosing items from a larger set without considering the order, we use combinations. If the order matters, like in permutations, but I think in this case it doesn't. Choosing two oranges, whether you pick orange A first and orange B second, or vice versa, it's the same pair. So combinations are the way to go here.\n\nThe formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n! divided by (k! times (n - k)!), right? So n is the total number of items, which is 10 here, and k is the number we're choosing, which is 2.\n\nLet me write that down: 10 choose 2. So 10! divided by (2! * (10-2)!).\n\nWait, 10! is 10 factorial, which is a big number. But I think there's a way to simplify this. 10! is 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 1, but (10-2)! is 8! So the 8! in the numerator and denominator will cancel out. Let me see:\n\n10! / (2! * 8!) = (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8! ) / (2! \u00d7 8!) \n\nOh, right, because 10! is 10 \u00d79 \u00d78! So the 8! cancels out top and bottom. So we're left with (10 \u00d79) / 2! \n\nWhat's 2!? That's 2 \u00d71 = 2. So now it's (90) / 2, which is 45. So the number of ways is 45. Looking at the options, option A is 45. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but just to double-check. Another way to think about it is: how many choices do I have for the first orange? 10 options. Then for the second, since I can't choose the same one again, 9 options. So 10 \u00d79 =90. But wait, that's if order matters. Because choosing orange 1 then 2 is different from 2 then 1 in that case. But in combinations, those are considered the same, so I need to divide by 2! to eliminate the order. So 90 divided by 2 is 45. Yep, same result.\n\nSo definitely, the answer is 45, which is option A.\n",

I remember that when you're choosing items without considering the order, you use combinations. If order matters, it's permutations. But in this case, choosing 2 oranges, the order doesn't matter.

Let's calculate that.\n\n10! is 10 factorial, which is 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 1. But when we calculate the combination, a lot of terms cancel out.
