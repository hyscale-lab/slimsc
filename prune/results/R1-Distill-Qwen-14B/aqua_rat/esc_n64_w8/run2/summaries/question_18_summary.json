      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe question is about a Home Appliance Store that sold an average of 42 microwave ovens per month last year. Then, in the first 10 months of this year, they sold an average of only 20 per month. The question is asking for the average number of microwaves sold per month over the entire 22-month period. The options are A)21, B)30, C)31, D)32, and E)None of the above.\n\nHmm, so I think I need to find the total number of microwaves sold in those 22 months and then divide by 22 to get the average. But wait, how exactly do I calculate that?\n\nLet me break it down. Last year has 12 months, right? So the store sold an average of 42 per month. So the total for last year would be 42 multiplied by 12. Let me do that: 42 times 12. Hmm, 40 times 12 is 480, and 2 times 12 is 24, so adding those together is 504. So 504 microwaves last year.\n\nThen this year, the first 10 months have an average of 20 per month. So the total this year so far is 20 times 10, which is 200. So 200 microwaves in the first 10 months.\n\nWait, but the total period is 22 months. So that's 12 months last year plus 10 months this year, which adds up to 22. So the total microwaves sold in all 22 months is 504 + 200. Let's calculate that: 504 plus 200 is 704.\n\nNow, the average per month over 22 months would be the total divided by 22. So 704 divided by 22. Let me compute that. Hmm, 22 times 30 is 660. 704 minus 660 is 44. 44 divided by 22 is 2. So that's 30 plus 2, which is 32. Wait, wait, wait. So 32 is the average.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 32. So that's the answer, right?\n\nWait a second, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, last year: 42 per month for 12 months. 42 * 12 = 504. Correct.\n\nThis year's first 10 months: 20 per month. 20 *10=200. Correct.\n\nTotal microwaves: 504 +200=704. Correct.\n\nTotal months: 12 +10=22. Correct.\n\nAverage: 704 /22. Let's see, 22*30=660. 704-660=44. 44/22=2. So 30+2=32. Yep, that's right. So the average is 32, which is option D.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up any numbers. Sometimes I might confuse the numbers, like thinking it's 12 months plus 10, which is 22. Yeah, that's correct. And the totals add up correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check 22 times 32. Let's see, 20*32=640, and 2*32=64. So 640+64=704. Yes, that matches the total. So the average is indeed 32.\n\nSo the correct answer is D)32.\n",

Hmm, let's break this down step by step. \n\nAlright, the problem says that last year, which I guess is 12 months, the store sold an average of 42 microwaves per month. So, I think I should calculate the total number sold last year first. To get that, I'll multiply the average by the number of months. So 42 times 12. Let me do that math. 42 times 10 is 420, and 42 times 2 is 84, so adding them gives 504. So last year, they sold 504 microwaves in total.\n\nThen, this year, in the first 10 months, the average was 20 per month. So the total for those 10 months would be 20 multiplied by 10. That's easy, 200.\n\nNow, the total time period we're looking at is 22 months. That makes sense because last year is 12 months plus 10 months this year. So, to find the overall average, I need the total microwaves sold over all 22 months, divided by 22.\n\nWait, but wait. Did the problem mention anything about the rest of the months this year? Oh right, it says in the first 10 months, so maybe the remaining 2 months aren't included. But the question is about the entire 22 months period. Oh, wait, no, because last year is 12 months, and this year's first 10, so 12+10 is 22. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total sold is 504 (last year) + 200 (this year's first 10) = 704. Now, to find the average per month, I divide 704 by 22.\n\nLet me compute that. 22 times 31 is 682. Because 22*30 is 660, plus 22 is 682. 704 minus 682 is 22. So 22 more would be 32. So 22*32 = 704. Oh wait, wait. Because 22*32 is 22*(30+2) = 660 +44 = 704. Yes, exactly.\n\nSo the average is 32 per month over the 22 months. Looking at the options, D is 32.

So, the question is about finding the average number of microwaves sold per month over a 22-month period. Hmm, okay, I'll try to break it down.\n\nSo, the problem says that last year, which I think is the previous 12 months, the store sold an average of 42 per month. Then, in the first 10 months of this year, the average dropped to 20 per month. I need to find the average over the entire 22 months.\n\nWait, wait, so last year is 12 months, right? And the first 10 months of this year add up to 10 months. So 12 + 10 is 22. That makes sense because the question is about a 22-month period.\n\nAlright, to find the overall average, I think I need the total number of microwaves sold during all 22 months, and then divide by 22. So, the formula for average is total divided by the number of months.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total for last year. If the average was 42 per month for 12 months, then the total is 42 multiplied by 12. Let me compute that. 42 times 12... 40 times 12 is 480, and 2 times 12 is 24, so 480 + 24 = 504. So, last year, they sold 504 microwaves.\n\nNext, the first 10 months of this year had an average of 20. So, the total is 20 times 10. That's 200. So, 200 microwaves in those 10 months.\n\nAdding those together, the total for 22 months is 504 + 200. Let's see, 504 plus 200 is 704. So, 704 microwaves in total.\n\nNow, to find the average per month over 22 months, I divide the total by 22. So 704 divided by 22. Hmm, let me calculate that. \n\nWait, 22 times 30 is 660. Because 22 * 30 = 660. Then, 704 minus 660 is 44. So that's 44 left. Now, 44 divided by 22 is 2. So, 30 + 2 = 32. So, 704 / 22 = 32.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because 22 * 32 is 704. Let me check that again. 32 times 22: 30*22=660, 2*22=44, so 660 +44=704. Yep, correct.\n\nSo the average is 32. Now looking at the options, option D is 32. So the answer should be D.

The average is the total number sold divided by the number of months, which is 22.\n\nSo first, let me calculate the total number sold in each period. For last year: average of 42 per month for 12 months. So 42 multiplied by 12. Let me do that math. 42 * 12. Hmm, 40*12 is 480, and 2*12 is 24, so 480 +24=504. So 504 microwaves last year.\n\nThen this year, the first 10 months: average of 20 per month. So 20 *10 is 200. So 200 microwaves so far this year.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the entire 22 months period. So I think we need to add the two totals together. 504 + 200 equals 704. So the total microwaves sold over 22 months is 704.\n\nNow, to find the average per month, I divide 704 by 22. Let's see. 704 divided by 22. Hmm, let me calculate this. 22 times 30 is 660, because 22*30=660. Subtract that from 704: 704-660=44. Now, 22 times 2 is 44. So that's 30 + 2 = 32. So 22*32=704. Oh, so the average is 32 per month.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 32. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait a second, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a calculation mistake. Let me recalculate the division. 22 times 32: 20*32 is 640, 2*32 is 64. 640 +64=704. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the average is indeed 32. So the correct answer is D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about calculating an average. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about a Home Appliance Store that sold microwave ovens. Last year, on average, they sold 42 per month. Then, in the first 10 months of this year, their average dropped to 20 per month. The question is asking what the average was over the entire 22-month period.\n\nWait, wait. Let me make sure I understand. So last year is presumably 12 months, right? Because that's the usual number of months in a year. Then, the first 10 months of this year. So 12 plus 10 is 22 months total. Got it.\n\nSo I need to find the average number of microwaves sold per month over 22 months. The average is the total number sold divided by the number of months, which is 22.\n\nSo first, let me calculate the total number sold in each period. For last year: average of 42 per month for 12 months. So 42 multiplied by 12. Let me do that math. 42 * 12. Hmm, 40*12 is 480, and 2*12 is 24, so 480 +24=504. So 504 microwaves last year.\n\nThen this year, the first 10 months: average of 20 per month. So 20 *10 is 200. So 200 microwaves so far this year.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the entire 22 months period. So I think we need to add the two totals together. 504 + 200 equals 704. So the total microwaves sold over 22 months is 704.\n\nNow, to find the average per month, I divide 704 by 22. Let's see. 704 divided by 22. Hmm, let me calculate this. 22 times 30 is 660, because 22*30=660. Subtract that from 704: 704-660=44. Now, 22 times 2 is 44. So that's 30 + 2 = 32. So 22*32=704. Oh, so the average is 32 per month.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 32. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait a second, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a calculation mistake. Let me recalculate the division. 22 times 32: 20*32 is 640, 2*32 is 64. 640 +64=704. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the average is indeed 32. So the correct answer is D.\n\n\nTo determine the average number of microwave ovens sold per month over the 22-month period, we calculate the total number of microwaves sold and divide it by the total number of months.\n\n1. **Calculate total microwaves sold last year**:  \n   The store sold an average of 42 microwaves per month for 12 months.  \n   \\[\n   42 \\times 12 = 504\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate total microwaves sold in the first 10 months of this year**:  \n   The store sold an average of 20 microwaves per month for 10 months.  \n   \\[\n   20 \\times 10 = 200\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of microwaves sold over 22 months**:  \n   \\[\n   504 + 200 = 704\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the average number of microwaves sold per month over 22 months**:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{704}{22} = 32\n   \\]\n\nThus, the average number of microwaves sold per month over the 22-month period is **32**.

Hmm, wait, but I should clarify, last year is a year, which is 12 months, right? So that part is clear. So last year, their average per month was 42. So the total number sold last year would be 42 multiplied by 12. Let me calculate that: 42 * 12. Hmm, 40*12 is 480, and 2*12 is 24, so 480+24=504. So last year, they sold 504 microwaves in total.\n\nNow, this year, in the first 10 months, their average was only 20 per month. Oh wait, wait. So this year is 2023? Or does it matter? No, I think the question is about the period spanning 22 months. Let me see, last year was 12 months, and this year, first 10 months. So 12 +10=22 months total.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out the average number of microwave ovens sold per month over a 22-month period. Let me break this down.\n\nLast year, which I think is 12 months, the store sold an average of 42 microwaves each month. So for the whole year, that would be 42 multiplied by 12. Let me calculate that. 42 times 12... 40*12 is 480, and 2*12 is 24, so 480+24=504. So last year, they sold 504 microwaves.\n\nNow, this year, in the first 10 months, the average is 20 per month. So that's 20 times 10, which is 200. So this year so far, they've sold 200.\n\nWait, the total period is 22 months. Last year is 12 months, and the first 10 months of this year make 22? Wait, 12+10 is 22? Oh, right, because 12 +10 is 22. So the total time is 22 months, combining last year and the first 10 months of this year.\n\nSo the total microwaves sold would be last year's total plus this year's first 10 months. So 504 + 200 equals 704.\n\nNow, the average over 22 months would be the total divided by 22. So 704 divided by 22. Let me compute that. Hmm, 22 times 30 is 660, because 22*30=660. 704 minus 660 is 44. So 44 divided by 22 is 2. So 30 + 2 = 32. So 704/22=32.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is 32. So the answer should be D, right?\n\nWait a second, did I make a mistake in calculating the totals? Let me double-check.\n\nLast year: 12 months * 42 = 504. Correct. This year: 10 months *20=200. Correct. Total is 504+200=704. Divided by 22 months: 704 /22.\n\nLet me do that division again. 22 into 704.\n\n22 *30 is 660. 704 -660 =44. 44 is 2*22, so 30+2=32. So yes, 32.\n\nSo the average is 32. So the correct answer is D.\n\n\nTo determine the average number of microwave ovens sold per month over the 22-month period, we first calculate the total number of microwaves sold in each segment of the period.\n\n1. **Last Year (12 months):**  \n   The average sales per month were 42.  \n   Total sales = \\( 42 \\times 12 = 504 \\).\n\n2. **First 10 Months of This Year:**  \n   The average sales per month were 20.  \n   Total sales = \\( 20 \\times 10 = 200 \\).\n\n3. **Total Sales Over 22 Months:**  \n   Adding the totals from both periods:  \n   \\( 504 + 200 = 704 \\).\n\n4. **Average Sales Over 22 Months:**  \n   The average is calculated as total sales divided by the total number of months:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Average} = \\frac{704}{22} = 32.\n   \\]\n\nThus, the average number of microwave ovens sold per month over the 22-month period is **32**.\n\nAnswer: D",

Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says that last year, the store sold an average of 42 microwaves per month. Wait, wait\u2014last year is 12 months, right? Because a year usually has 12 months. So if the average was 42, then the total number sold last year must be 42 multiplied by 12. Let me calculate that. 42 times 12 is... 504. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nThen, this year, in the first 10 months, they've only averaged 20 per month. So for those 10 months, the total would be 20 multiplied by 10. 20 times 10 is 200. Hmm, that's a big drop from last year.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the average over the entire 22 months. So that's the 12 months of last year plus the first 10 months of this year. So the total number of months is 12 + 10 = 22 months. Got it.\n\nTo find the average, I need the total number of microwaves sold in those 22 months divided by 22. So first, I'll add last year's total and this year's total. Last year was 504, this year so far is 200. So 504 + 200 equals 704. Wait, no, wait a second\u2014that can't be right. Because 504 plus 200 is 704? Let me check: 500 + 200 is 700, and 4 more makes 704. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo the total sold is 704 over 22 months. Now, to find the average per month, I divide 704 by 22. Hmm, what's 704 divided by 22? Let me think. 22 times 30 is 660. 704 minus 660 is 44. So that's 30 with a remainder of 44. Now, 44 divided by 22 is 2. So 30 plus 2 is 32. So 704 divided by 22 is 32.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Let me do it more carefully. 22 times 32 is 704. Because 22 *30 is 660, and 22*2 is 44. 660 +44=704. Yes, correct. So the average is 32 per month.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 32. So the answer should be D.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Did I calculate the totals correctly? Last year: 12 months *42=504. First 10 months: 10*20=200. Total is 504+200=704. Divided by 22 months: 704/22=32. Yep, that's right.\n\nSo the correct answer is D)32.\n",
