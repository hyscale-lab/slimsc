Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the information. \n\nThe first part says that 10 years ago, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay. So if I let Ajay's age 10 years ago be A, then Sachin's age at that time would have been 2A.\n\nThe second part tells me that in 10 years, Sachin will be 40. That means, currently, Sachin's age is 40 minus 10, which is 30. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, because if in 10 years he'll be 40, that's adding 10 years to his current age. So current age is 40 minus 10, which is 30. So Sachin is 30 years old today.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think about it. So, if he's 30 now, then in 10 years, he'll be 40. Yes, that's correct. So current age of Sachin is 30.\n\nNow, 10 years ago, Sachin was 30 minus 10, which is 20 years old. And at that time, he was twice as old as Ajay.

So Ajay is 20 years old today.\n\nWait, let me double-check. So 10 years ago, Ajay was 10. So now, he's 20. Sachin is 30 now, which makes sense because in 10 years he'll be 40.

And then it says that Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years. I think I should write down the information to make it clearer.\n\nLet me assign variables to their current ages. Let's say Sachin's current age is S, and Ajay's current age is A. \n\nThe first part says that 10 years ago, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay. So, 10 years ago, Sachin's age would have been S - 10, and Ajay's age would have been A - 10. And according to the problem, S - 10 equals twice (A - 10). So that gives me the equation:\n\nS - 10 = 2*(A - 10)\n\nThe second part says that Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years. That means Sachin's current age plus 10 years equals 40. So:\n\nS + 10 = 40\n\nWait, that's a straightforward equation. Let me solve that first. Subtracting 10 from both sides, S = 30. So Sachin is currently 30 years old.\n\nNow that I know S is 30, I can plug that back into the first equation to find A. \n\nSo substituting S = 30 into the first equation:\n\n30 - 10 = 2*(A - 10)\n\nWhich simplifies to 20 = 2*(A -10)\n\nDivide both sides by 2: 10 = A -10\n\nThen add 10 to both sides: A = 20\n\nSo Ajay is 20 years old today.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Ten years ago, Sachin was 20, Ajay was 10. Yes, 20 is twice 10. And in 10 years, Sachin will be 40, which matches the condition. So Ajay is 20. Looking at the options, D is 20.\n",

So, 10 years ago, Sachin's age would have been S - 10, and Ajay's age would have been A - 10. And according to the problem, S - 10 equals twice (A - 10). So that gives me the equation:\n\nS - 10 = 2*(A - 10)\n\nThe second part says that Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years. That means Sachin's current age plus 10 years equals 40. So:\n\nS + 10 = 40\n\nWait, that's a straightforward equation. Let me solve that first. Subtracting 10 from both sides, S = 30. So Sachin is currently 30 years old.\n\nNow that I know S is 30, I can plug that back into the first equation to find A. \n\nSo substituting S = 30 into the first equation:\n\n30 - 10 = 2*(A - 10)\n\nWhich simplifies to 20 = 2*(A -10)\n\nDivide both sides by 2: 10 = A -10\n\nThen add 10 to both sides: A = 20\n\nSo Ajay is 20 years old today.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Ten years ago, Sachin was 20, Ajay was 10. Yes, 20 is twice 10. And in 10 years, Sachin will be 40, which matches the condition. So Ajay is 20. Looking at the options, D is 20.\n\n\nLet\u2019s solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Define Variables**:  \n   Let Sachin's current age be \\( S \\) and Ajay's current age be \\( A \\).\n\n2. **First Condition**:  \n   Ten years ago, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay.  \n   This gives the equation:  \n   \\[\n   S - 10 = 2(A - 10)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Second Condition**:  \n   Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years.  \n   This gives the equation:  \n   \\[\n   S + 10 = 40\n   \\]  \n   Solving for \\( S \\):  \n   \\[\n   S = 40 - 10 = 30\n   \\]\n\n4. **Substitute \\( S = 30 \\) into the First Equation**:  \n   \\[\n   30 - 10 = 2(A - 10)\n   \\]  \n   Simplify:  \n   \\[\n   20 = 2(A - 10)\n   \\]  \n   Divide both sides by 2:  \n   \\[\n   10 = A - 10\n   \\]  \n   Add 10 to both sides:  \n   \\[\n   A = 20\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**:  \n   Ajay is currently 20 years old.  \n\n**Answer: D**",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to solve this age-related problem. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem says: Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back. How old is Ajay today if Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's figure out Sachin's current age. The problem says he will be 40 in 10 years. So, if in 10 years he's 40, that means today he's 40 minus 10, which is 30. So Sachin is 30 years old right now.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait. Let me think again. If someone will be 40 in 10 years, their current age is 40 minus 10, which is 30. Yeah, that's correct. So Sachin is 30 today.\n\nNow, 10 years back, how old was Sachin? Well, 10 years ago he was 30 minus 10, which is 20 years old.\n\nThe problem states that 10 years ago, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay. So, if Sachin was 20, then Ajay was half of that. So Ajay was 10 years old at that time.\n\nWait, wait. Let me make sure. So 10 years ago, Ajay was 10. So how old is Ajay today? Well, 10 years have passed since then. So Ajay's current age is 10 plus 10, which is 20.\n\nSo Ajay is 20 years old today. Let me check the options. The options are A)18, B)25, C)15, D)20, E)21. So D is 20. That should be the answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Let me lay it out with equations to be sure.\n\nLet S be Sachin's current age, A be Ajay's current age.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\n1. Sachin's age in 10 years: S + 10 = 40 \u2192 S = 30.\n\nSo Sachin is 30 now.\n\n10 years ago, Sachin was S - 10 = 20 years old.\n\nAt that time, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay. So, 20 = 2*(Ajay's age 10 years ago).\n\nAjay's age 10 years ago: 20 / 2 = 10.\n\nSo Ajay's current age is 10 + 10 = 20.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer is D)20.\n\n\nLet \\( S \\) be Sachin's current age and \\( A \\) be Ajay's current age.\n\n1. From the problem, Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years:\n   \\[\n   S + 10 = 40 \\implies S = 30\n   \\]\n   So, Sachin is currently 30 years old.\n\n2. Ten years ago, Sachin's age was:\n   \\[\n   S - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. The problem states that 10 years ago, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay:\n   \\[\n   20 = 2 \\times (\\text{Ajay's age 10 years ago})\n   \\]\n   Solving for Ajay's age 10 years ago:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ajay's age 10 years ago} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10\n   \\]\n\n4. Therefore, Ajay's current age is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ajay's age today} = 10 + 10 = 20\n   \\]\n\nThus, Ajay is 20 years old today. The correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: D**",
