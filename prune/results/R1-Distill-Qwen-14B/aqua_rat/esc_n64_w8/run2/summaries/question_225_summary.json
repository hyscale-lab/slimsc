      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a rectangular parking space. Let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nThe problem says that three sides are painted, and the fourth isn't. The unpainted side is 9 feet long. Also, the sum of the painted sides is 37 feet. I need to find the area of the parking space.\n\nHmm, right. So, rectangles have opposite sides equal. Let me think about how the sides are arranged. If it's a rectangle, there are two lengths and two widths. Since three sides are painted, maybe two of one type and one of the other. Or perhaps it's the other way around.\n\nWait, the problem doesn't specify which sides are painted. So I guess I have to consider both possibilities. But wait, maybe the way the question is phrased can help. It says three sides are painted. So, if it's a rectangle, it's possible that either two lengths and one width are painted, leaving one length unpainted, or two widths and one length painted, leaving one width unpainted.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the unpainted side is 9 feet. So depending on which side is unpainted, that gives different dimensions.\n\nLet me try to model this.\n\nCase 1: The unpainted side is one of the lengths. So the two lengths and one width are painted. The sum of the painted sides would be 2L + W. Wait, no. Wait, three sides are painted: so in a rectangle, if you have two lengths and one width painted, that's correct. Because the fourth side is the other width, which is unpainted. So the unpainted side would be a width, right? So if the unpainted side is 9 feet, that would be the width, W = 9.\n\nWait, but wait, the sum of the painted sides is 37. So 2L + W = 37. Since W is 9, that would make 2L +9=37. So 2L=28, so L=14. Then the area is L * W = 14*9=126.\n\nCase 2: Alternatively, the unpainted side is a length. So the painted sides would be two widths and one length. So sum is 2W + L =37. The unpainted side is L=9. Then 2W +9=37 \u2192 2W=28 \u2192 W=14. Then area is L*W =9*14=126.\n\nWait, so in both cases, the area is 126. So that must be the answer. Looking at the options, option C is 126. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes in these problems, there's a trick.\n\nWait, the problem says three sides are painted. So the sides painted are two of one dimension and one of another. So for a rectangle, the total perimeter is 2L + 2W. But here, three sides are painted, so the sum is either 2L + W or L + 2W. Depending on which side is unpainted.\n\nIn case 1: unpainted is W=9, so painted sum is 2L + W=37. So 2L =37-9=28 \u2192 L=14. Area is 14*9=126.\n\nIn case 2: unpainted is L=9, so painted sum is L + 2W=37. So 2W=37-9=28 \u2192 W=14. Area is 9*14=126.\n\nSo either way, area is same. So answer is 126. So option C.\n",

The sum of the painted sides is 37 feet. We need to find the area of the parking space. Hmm, area is length times width, so I need to find both dimensions.\n\nWait, let's visualize this. A rectangle has two lengths and two widths. If three sides are painted, that could be either two lengths and one width, or two widths and one length. Oh right, because depending on which side isn't painted, the other three would be painted. So I think the problem is that either the length or the width is the unpainted side.\n\nLet me denote the length as L and the width as W. Suppose the unpainted side is the length, so L is 9 feet. Then the painted sides would be the other length (L) and the two widths (W each). So the sum of painted sides is L + 2W. \n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, if the unpainted side is a length, then the painted sides would be the other length and the two widths. Or if the unpainted is a width, then the painted sides would be the two lengths and the other width.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I should think about it this way: the rectangle has two pairs of equal sides. If the unpainted side is one of the length sides, then the three painted sides would be one length and both widths. Alternatively, if the unpainted side is a width, then the three painted sides would be both lengths and one width.\n\nSo let's consider both cases.\n\nCase 1: Unpainted side is the length (L=9). Then painted sides are the other length (L) and two widths (W each). So the sum is L + 2W = 37. Since L is 9, substituting:\n\n9 + 2W =37. Subtract 9: 2W=28 \u2192 W=14. So the width is 14. Then area is L*W =9*14=126. Hmm, 126 is one of the options, option C.\n\nCase 2: Unpainted side is the width (W=9). Then painted sides are the two lengths (each L) and the other width (W).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem about a rectangular parking space. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says that a rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides. The length of the unpainted side is 9 feet. The sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet. We need to find the area of the parking space in square feet. The options are A)46, B)81, C)126, D)252, E)None.\n\nHmm. So, let me visualize this. A rectangle has four sides: two lengths and two widths. Since three sides are painted, one side isn't. I need to figure out which sides are painted and which isn't. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify which side is unpainted\u2014could it be a length or a width? That's important because it affects the calculations.\n\nLet me think. If it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So, if the unpainted side is, say, a length, then the other length is also unpainted. Wait, but the problem says only three sides are painted. That means one side is unpainted. So the other three must be painted. Wait, but in a rectangle, the opposite sides are equal. So, if one length is unpainted, the other length is the same as that, so would both lengths be unpainted? No, because that would mean two sides are unpainted. That can't be right because the problem says only one side is unpainted.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me clarify: a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides. So, if three sides are painted, that implies that one side is not. So, the three painted sides must include either two lengths and one width, or two widths and one length, depending on which side is unpainted.\n\nSo, there are two possibilities here: either the unpainted side is a length or a width.\n\nLet me assign some variables to make this clearer. Let's say the length is L and the width is W.\n\nCase 1: The unpainted side is the length (L). Then, the three painted sides would be the other length (L), and both widths (W and W). So the sum of the painted sides would be L + W + W = L + 2W. The problem states that the sum of the painted sides is 37 feet. So, L + 2W = 37.\n\nWe also know that the unpainted side (L) is 9 feet. So, L =9. Substituting into the equation: 9 + 2W =37. Subtract 9 from both sides: 2W=28, so W=14. Then, the area would be L * W = 9*14=126. That's one of the options, option C.\n\nCase 2: The unpainted side is a width (W). Then, the three painted sides would be the other width (W), and both lengths (L and L). So the sum is W + 2L =37. The unpainted side is W=9. Substituting: 9 + 2L=37. Subtract 9: 2L=28 \u2192 L=14. Then, the area is L * W=14*9=126 again. Same as before.\n\nWait, so in both cases, the area is 126. That's interesting. So regardless of whether the unpainted side is a length or a width, the area comes out the same. So the answer should be C)126.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Let's go through each case again.\n\nCase 1: Unpainted is L=9. Painted sides are L, W, W. So L + 2W=37 \u2192 9 +2W=37 \u2192 2W=28 \u2192 W=14. Area=9*14=126. That's correct.\n\nCase 2: Unpainted is W=9. Painted sides are W, L, L. So W + 2L=37 \u2192 9 +2L=37 \u2192 2L=28 \u2192 L=14. Area=14*9=126. Also correct.\n\nSo both cases lead to the same area. Therefore, the correct answer must be C)126.\n",

So, the unpainted side could be either a length or a width.\n\nCase 1: The unpainted side is a length. Then, the painted sides are two widths and one length. So the sum of painted sides would be 2W + L.\n\nCase 2: The unpainted side is a width. Then, the painted sides are two lengths and one width. Sum is 2L + W.\n\nNow, the problem says the sum of painted sides is 37 feet. And the unpainted side is 9 feet.\n\nSo, let's write equations for both cases.\n\nCase 1: unpainted is length (L =9)\nThen, painted sum: 2W + L =37\nBut L=9, so 2W +9 =37 \u2192 2W=28 \u2192 W=14.\n\nThen, area is L * W = 9 *14 =126.\n\nCase 2: unpainted is width (W=9)\nThen, painted sum: 2L + W =37 \u2192 2L +9 =37 \u2192 2L=28 \u2192 L=14.\n\nArea is L*W=14*9=126.\n\nWait, in both cases, the area is the same. So regardless of whether the unpainted side is length or width, the area comes out to 126.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 126. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but wait a second, are there any other possibilities? Like, what if the rectangle isn't a standard one? No, I think the problem is straightforward. It's a rectangle, so opposite sides are equal. So the cases are the two possibilities I considered.\n\nSo the area is 126, so the correct option is C.\n\n\nThe problem involves a rectangular parking space where three sides are painted, and the fourth side is unpainted. The unpainted side is 9 feet long, and the sum of the painted sides is 37 feet. To find the area of the parking space, we analyze the two possible cases:\n\n1. **Case 1: The unpainted side is a length (L = 9 feet).**  \n   The painted sides consist of two widths (W) and one length (L). The sum of the painted sides is:  \n   \\[\n   2W + L = 37\n   \\]  \n   Substituting \\( L = 9 \\):  \n   \\[\n   2W + 9 = 37 \\implies 2W = 28 \\implies W = 14\n   \\]  \n   The area is then:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = L \\times W = 9 \\times 14 = 126\n   \\]\n\n2. **Case 2: The unpainted side is a width (W = 9 feet).**  \n   The painted sides consist of two lengths (L) and one width (W). The sum of the painted sides is:  \n   \\[\n   2L + W = 37\n   \\]  \n   Substituting \\( W = 9 \\):  \n   \\[\n   2L + 9 = 37 \\implies 2L = 28 \\implies L = 14\n   \\]  \n   The area is then:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = L \\times W = 14 \\times 9 = 126\n   \\]\n\nIn both cases, the area of the parking space is 126 square feet. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: C**",

The question says that three sides are painted, and the fourth side is unpainted. The unpainted side is 9 feet long. Also, the sum of the painted sides is 37 feet. They're asking for the area of the parking space.\n\nHmm, first, I should visualize this. A rectangle has two pairs of equal sides. Let's say the sides are length and width. If three sides are painted, that could mean either two lengths and one width, or two widths and one length. Wait, but in a rectangle, adjacent sides are different, so if you have three sides painted, one of the dimensions must be used twice and the other once. \n\nSo, let's denote the length as L and the width as W. Now, depending on which side is unpainted, the sum of the painted sides will change. If the unpainted side is a length, then the painted sides would be two widths and one length. Alternatively, if the unpainted side is a width, the painted sides would be two lengths and one width.\n\nWait, the problem says the unpainted side is 9 feet. So that's either L or W. Let's think about both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: The unpainted side is the length (L = 9 ft). Then the painted sides would be two widths (W) and one length (L). So the sum would be W + W + L = 2W + L. According to the problem, this sum is 37 feet. So 2W + 9 = 37. Let me solve for W: 2W = 37 -9 = 28, so W = 14.\n\nThen the area would be L * W = 9 *14 = 126 square feet.\n\nCase 2: The unpainted side is the width (W=9 ft). Then the painted sides would be two lengths (L) and one width (W). So sum is 2L + W = 37. Substituting W=9: 2L +9=37 \u2192 2L=28 \u2192 L=14. So area is L * W =14 *9=126 again. Oh, same area.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So regardless of whether the unpainted side is length or width, the area ends up being 126. So the answer should be 126, which is option C.\n\nWait a second, but let me double-check. Did I set the equations correctly?\n\nIn case 1: Unpainted is L=9. Painted sides are 2W + L. So 2W +9=37 \u2192 2W=28 \u2192 W=14. Then area 9*14=126.\n\nCase2: Unpainted is W=9. Painted sides 2L +9=37 \u2192 2L=28 \u2192 L=14. Area 14*9=126.
