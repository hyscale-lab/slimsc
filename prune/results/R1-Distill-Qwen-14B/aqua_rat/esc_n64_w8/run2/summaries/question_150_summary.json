      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about two trains crossing each other. Let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on relative speed problems, but I'll try to work it out.\n\nSo, the problem says: Train M leaves City A at 5 am and arrives in City B at 9 am. That means it takes 4 hours to go from A to B. Train N leaves City B at 7 am and arrives in City A at 10:30 am, so it takes 3.5 hours. I need to find the time they cross each other.\n\nHmm, I remember that when two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. But wait, I should probably find their speeds first.\n\nLet me denote the distance between City A and City B as D. That might make the calculations easier. So, D is the same for both trains since they're traveling between the same two cities.\n\nTrain M's speed: It covers D in 4 hours. So, speed of M is D/4 per hour.\n\nTrain N's speed: It covers D in 3.5 hours. So, speed is D/(3.5) per hour. Let me compute that. 3.5 hours is the same as 7/2 hours, so D/(7/2) is (2D)/7. So, N's speed is (2D/7) per hour.\n\nWait, but I should think about the timings. Train M starts at 5 am and arrives at 9 am. So it's moving from A to B. Train N leaves B at 7 am, going towards A, arriving at 10:30 am.\n\nSo the two trains are moving towards each other, but they don't start at the same time. I need to figure out when they meet.\n\nLet me think about the time intervals. Train M has a head start. It leaves at 5 am, while N leaves at 7 am. So from 5 am to 7 am, M has been traveling for 2 hours before N even starts.\n\nIn those 2 hours, how far does M go? M's speed is D/4 per hour, so in 2 hours, it covers (D/4)*2 = D/2. So when N starts at 7 am, M is already D/2 away from A, which is halfway towards B.\n\nNow, from 7 am onwards, both trains are moving towards each other. Let me consider the time t after 7 am when they meet.\n\nIn that time t, M will cover (D/4)*t distance, and N will cover (2D/7)*t distance. The sum of these two distances should be the remaining distance between them when N starts, which is D minus D/2 = D/2.\n\nSo, equation: (D/4)*t + (2D/7)*t = D/2.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n(D/4) * t + (2D/7) * t = D/2.\n\nI can factor out D and t:\n\nD * t (1/4 + 2/7) = D/2.\n\nDivide both sides by D (since D is not zero):\n\nt (1/4 + 2/7) = 1/2.\n\nLet me compute the sum inside the parentheses. 1/4 is 0.25 and 2/7 is approximately 0.2857. Wait, but let me compute it exactly.\n\n1/4 + 2/7 = (7 + 8) / 28 = 15/28.\n\nSo, t * (15/28) = 1/2.\n\nSolving for t:\n\nt = (1/2) / (15/28) = (1/2) * (28/15) = 14/15 hours.\n\nWait, 14 divided by 15 hours. Let me convert that to minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 14/15 hours is (14/15)*60 = 56 minutes.\n\nSo, t is 56 minutes. That means they meet 56 minutes after 7 am. So 7:00 am plus 56 minutes is 7:56 am.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, the choices are given in minutes, not as times. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA)1 hr 23 min \u2192 83 min\n\nB)1 hr 15 min \u219275 min\n\nC)1 hr 8 min \u219268 min\n\nD)56 min\n\nE)55 min.\n\nSo, 56 minutes is option D. But wait, I thought the answer was 56 minutes. So the time when they cross is 7:56 am.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the setup.\n\nAlternative approach: Let me consider the distance covered by each train until they meet.\n\nFrom 5 am to 7 am, M travels 2 hours, covering D/2.\n\nFrom 7 am on, both are moving towards each other. Let the time taken after 7 am be t hours.\n\nSo, distance covered by M in t hours: (D/4) * t.\n\nDistance covered by N in t hours: (2D/7) * t.\n\nThese two distances should add up to D/2 because the initial distance between them at 7 am is D/2.\n\nSo, (D/4) t + (2D/7) t = D/2.\n\nDivide both sides by D: (1/4 + 2/7) t = 1/2.\n\nSame as before: (7+8)/28 = 15/28. So t = (1/2) * (28/15) =14/15 hours \u2192 56 minutes. Yep, same result.\n\nSo the time when they meet is 7:00 am plus 56 minutes = 7:56 am.\n\nBut looking at the options, they're giving the time difference from when? Wait, the options are in terms of duration, not actual time. Oh, wait, no. The question says, \"At what time do the two trains cross one another?\" So the answer should be the actual time, like 7:56 am, but the options are presented in terms of how much time after a certain point.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the options are given as durations, but that can't be right. Because the options are listed as A) 1 hr 23 min, etc. Hmm, perhaps the question is phrased as the time taken after 7 am? Because 56 minutes is option D.\n\nWait, the options are presented as \"A) 1 hr 23 min\", which would be 83 minutes. So perhaps the answer is 56 minutes, which is option D.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me check if the setup is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate the meeting time based on the distance and speeds.\n\nAnother approach: Let me compute the time taken for each train to reach the meeting point.\n\nLet me denote the time after 7 am as t. So, at 7 am, M has already been traveling for 2 hours, so it's D/2 away from A.\n\nIn time t, M travels (D/4) * t, and N travels (2D/7)*t. The sum of these is D/2.\n\nSo, same equation as before, leading to t=56 min.\n\nSo, the time they meet is 7:56 am. But the options don't list times; they list durations. Wait, perhaps the options are showing how long each train has been traveling when they meet.\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the time elapsed since 7 am when they meet. So, 56 minutes after 7 am, which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I set up the equation. Let me try another approach.\n\nCompute the time each train has been traveling when they meet.\n\nTrain M starts at 5 am, so by the time they meet at 7:56 am, M has been traveling for 2 hours and 56 minutes, which is 2.9333 hours.\n\nTrain N starts at 7 am, so it has been traveling for 56 minutes, which is 56/60 = 1.4667 hours.\n\nThe distance covered by M: (D/4) * (2 + 56/60) = D/4 * (2 + 14/15) = D/4 * (44/15) = (11D)/(15).\n\nDistance covered by N: (2D/7) * (56/60) = (2D/7) * (14/15) = (28D)/(105) = (4D)/15.\n\nAdding these: (11D/15) + (4D/15) = 15D/15 = D. Which is correct because together they cover the entire distance D.\n\nWait, but according to the earlier setup, when N starts, the remaining distance is D/2. So perhaps I should check again.\n\nWait, from 5 am to 7 am is 2 hours. M's speed is D/4 per hour, so in 2 hours, D/4 *2 = D/2. So at 7 am, M is D/2 away from A. Then, from 7 am onward, M and N are moving towards each other, covering the remaining D/2 distance between them.\n\nSo, the relative speed is (D/4 + 2D/7) per hour. Let me compute that.\n\nD/4 + 2D/7 = (7D + 8D)/28 = 15D/28 per hour.\n\nTime to cover D/2 at this relative speed is (D/2) / (15D/28) )= (1/2) * (28/(15)) )= 14/15 hours = 56 minutes. So same as before.\n\nSo, the time they meet is 7:00 am + 56 minutes = 7:56 am. So, the time is 7:56 am. But looking at the options, the only option that matches 56 minutes is option D.\n\nWait, but wait. The problem is phrased as \"At what time do the two trains cross one another?\" So the answer should be the actual time, like 7:56 am, but the options don't have times, they have durations. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, looking again at the options:\n\nA)1 hr 23 min \u2192 83 min\n\nB)1 hr 15 min \u219275 min\n\nC)1 hr 8 min \u219268 min\n\nD)56 min\n\nE)55 min.\n\nHmm, perhaps the options are the time elapsed since 5 am. Let me think. If the meeting time is 7:56 am, that's 2 hours and 56 minutes after 5 am. Which is 2*60 +56 = 176 minutes. None of the options match that.\n\nAlternatively, since the meeting time is 56 minutes after 7 am, that's option D (56 minutes). So perhaps the question is asking how much time after 7 am do they meet, which would be 56 minutes, option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are not in terms of duration but in terms of the time of day. Wait, but the options are in the format of hours and minutes, which makes me think they're durations, not times of day.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the time taken after the earlier train starts. But I think the correct approach is that they meet 56 minutes after 7 am, which is 7:56 am. Since the options don't have 7:56, but have 56 minutes as option D, that's probably the intended answer.\n\nWait, another way to look at it is to compute the time when they meet in terms of the total distance covered by each.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial setup is wrong. Let me think about the total time each train has been traveling when they meet.\n\nWait, I think I've got the correct approach. The answer should be 56 minutes, which is option D.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about two trains crossing each other, and I'm supposed to figure out the time they meet. Hmm, let me try to break it down.\n\nAlright, so the first train, M, leaves City A at 5 am and arrives in City B at 9 am. That means it's traveling for 4 hours. The second train, N, leaves City B at 7 am and gets to City A at 10:30 am, so that's 3.5 hours of travel time.\n\nWait, I should probably figure out the speeds of both trains. Speed is distance divided by time. But wait, I don't know the distance between the cities. Oh, maybe I can call the distance D. So for train M, the distance D is covered in 4 hours. So speed of M is D/4. For train N, it covers the same distance D in 3.5 hours, so speed is D/(3.5), which is the same as 2D/7. Hmm, because 3.5 is 7/2, so reciprocal is 2/7.\n\nWait, wait, let me make sure. 3.5 hours is 7/2 hours. So D divided by (7/2) is D * (2/7) = 2D/7. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nNow, I need to find when they meet. So let's think about the timeline. Train M starts at 5 am, and train N starts at 7 am. So there's a two-hour gap before both are moving towards each other.\n\nWait, no, let me visualize this. At 5 am, M leaves A. At 7 am, N leaves B. So until 7 am, M has been traveling for 2 hours. In those 2 hours, how far has M gone?\n\nM's speed is D/4 per hour. So in 2 hours, it covers (D/4)*2 = D/2. So at 7 am, when N starts, M is already D/2 away from A towards B.\n\nSo the distance between them at 7 am is D minus D/2, which is D/2.\n\nNow, from 7 am onwards, both trains are moving towards each other. The relative speed would be the sum of their speeds because they're moving towards each other. So M's speed is D/4, and N's speed is 2D/7. Sum is D/4 + 2D/7.\n\nLet me compute that. To add fractions, find a common denominator. 4 and 7 have 28 as LCD. So D/4 is 7D/28, and 2D/7 is 8D/28. Adding them gives 15D/28. So the relative speed is 15D/28 per hour.\n\nThe distance between them at 7 am is D/2. So the time taken for them to meet after 7 am is (distance)/(relative speed) = (D/2) / (15D/28).\n\nHmm, D cancels out. So it's (1/2) / (15/28) = (1/2) * (28/15) = 14/15 hours. Wait, 14/15 hours is equal to how many minutes? 14/15 *60 = 56 minutes. So 56 minutes after 7 am.\n\nWait, 7 am plus 56 minutes is 7:56 am. But wait, looking at the options, E is 55 minutes, D is 56. Oh, so E is 55, D is 56. So the answer should be D)56 min.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I messed up the time calculation.\n\nWait, from 7 am, 56 minutes brings us to 7:56 am. So the time they meet is 7:56 am. But the options are in minutes, but let me see the options again.\n\nWait, the options are: A)1 hr 23 min, B)1 hr 15 min, C)1 hr 8 min, D)56 min, E)55 min. So the correct answer would be 56 minutes after 7 am, which is option D.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. When I added the speeds, did I do it correctly? M's speed is D/4, N's speed is 2D/7. Sum is D/4 + 2D/7. Let me compute that again.\n\nD/4 is 0.25D, 2D/7 is approximately 0.2857D. Sum is about 0.5357D per hour. So the relative speed is about 0.5357D/hour.\n\nThe distance between them at 7 am is D/2. So time is (D/2)/(0.5357D) = (0.5)/(0.5357) \u2248 0.9333 hours, which is about 56 minutes. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: Let\u2019s assume the distance D is 28 km, just to make the numbers easier. So M's speed is 28/4 =7 km/h. N's speed is 28/3.5 =8 km/h. So their relative speed is 15 km/h.\n\nAt 7 am, M has already traveled for 2 hours, so it's gone 7 *2=14 km. So the distance between them is 28-14=14 km.\n\nTime to meet after 7 am is 14 km /15 km/h = 14/15 hours = 56 minutes. Yep, same result.\n\nSo the correct answer is D)56 min.\n",

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of problems, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nAlright, the problem says: Train M leaves City A at 5 am and arrives in City B at 9 am. So that's a total travel time of 4 hours. Then, train N leaves City B at 7 am and arrives in City A at 10:30 am. That's a travel time of 3.5 hours or 3 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nI need to find out when they cross each other. So, they're moving towards each other on the same track, right? So, the moment they meet is when the sum of the distances they've covered equals the total distance between the two cities.\n\nWait, but I don't have the distance. Oh, right, maybe I can assume the distance as a variable or find it in terms of time and speed.\n\nLet me think. Let's denote the distance between City A and City B as D. Then, the speed of train M would be D divided by its travel time. Since M takes 4 hours, its speed is D/4. Similarly, train N's speed would be D divided by its travel time, which is 3.5 hours. So, D/(3.5) or 2D/7 when simplified.\n\nNow, I need to figure out how long after their departure times they meet. But wait, they didn't start at the same time. M leaves at 5 am, and N leaves at 7 am. So, M has a two-hour head start before N even starts moving.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think about their schedules. Train M is moving from A to B, departs at 5 am, arrives at 9 am. So, during the time from 5 to 7 am, it's been traveling for 2 hours. So, in those two hours, how far has it gone? Well, at a speed of D/4 per hour, it would have covered (D/4)*2 = D/2. So, when train N starts at 7 am, M is already halfway there.\n\nNow, from 7 am onward, both trains are moving towards each other. Let me denote the time after 7 am when they meet as t hours. So, during this time, M will cover (D/4)*t, and N will cover (2D/7)*t. The sum of these two distances should be equal to the remaining distance between them when N starts, which is D - D/2 = D/2.\n\nSo, setting up the equation: (D/4)*t + (2D/7)*t = D/2.\n\nHmm, let's compute that. Let's factor out D and t from the left side. D*t (1/4 + 2/7) = D/2.\n\nWe can divide both sides by D since D is not zero. So, t*(1/4 + 2/7) = 1/2.\n\nCalculating the sum inside the parentheses: 1/4 is 0.25, 2/7 is approximately 0.2857. Adding them together gives about 0.5357. But let me do it exactly with fractions.\n\n1/4 + 2/7 = (7 + 8)/28 = 15/28.\n\nSo, t*(15/28) = 1/2.\n\nTo solve for t, multiply both sides by 28/15:\n\nt = (1/2) * (28/15) = (28)/(30) = 14/15 hours.\n\nHmm, 14/15 hours is equal to 56 minutes, because 14/15 of an hour is (14/15)*60 = 56 minutes.\n\nSo, they meet 56 minutes after 7 am. 7 am plus 56 minutes is 7:56 am.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes these problems can have a twist. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the departure times.\n\nWait, M leaves at 5 am, so by 7 am, it's been 2 hours. It covers D/2, so the remaining distance is D/2. Then, both trains are moving towards each other. Their speeds add up because they're moving towards each other.\n\nWait, the combined speed is (D/4) + (2D/7) = (7D + 8D)/(28) = 15D/28 per hour.\n\nThe distance to cover is D/2. Time taken is (D/2) / (15D/28) = (D/2) * (28/(15D)) )= (28)/(30) = 14/15 hours, which is the same as before. So, yes, 56 minutes.\n\nSo the time they meet is 7 am plus 56 minutes, which is 7:56 am.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 55 minutes, and option D is 56 minutes.

Let's factor out D and t from the left side. D*t (1/4 + 2/7) = D/2.\n\nWe can divide both sides by D since D is not zero. So, t*(1/4 + 2/7) = 1/2.\n\nCalculating the sum inside the parentheses: 1/4 is 0.25, 2/7 is approximately 0.2857. Adding them together gives about 0.5357. But let me do it exactly with fractions.\n\n1/4 + 2/7 = (7 + 8)/28 = 15/28.\n\nSo, t*(15/28) = 1/2.\n\nTo solve for t, multiply both sides by 28/15:\n\nt = (1/2) * (28/15) = (28)/(30) = 14/15 hours.\n\nHmm, 14/15 hours is equal to 56 minutes, because 14/15 of an hour is (14/15)*60 = 56 minutes.\n\nSo, they meet 56 minutes after 7 am. 7 am plus 56 minutes is 7:56 am.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes these problems can have a twist. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the departure times.\n\nWait, M leaves at 5 am, so by 7 am, it's been 2 hours. It covers D/2, so the remaining distance is D/2. Then, both trains are moving towards each other. Their speeds add up because they're moving towards each other.\n\nWait, the combined speed is (D/4) + (2D/7) = (7D + 8D)/(28) = 15D/28 per hour.\n\nThe distance to cover is D/2. Time taken is (D/2) / (15D/28) = (D/2) * (28/(15D)) )= (28)/(30) = 14/15 hours, which is the same as before. So, yes, 56 minutes.\n\nSo the time they meet is 7 am plus 56 minutes, which is 7:56 am.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 55 minutes, and option D is 56 minutes. So the correct answer should be D)56 min.\n\nWait, but looking back, the options are a bit confusing. Let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)1 hr 23 min\n\nB)1 hr 15 min\n\nC)1 hr 8 min\n\nD)56 min\n\nE)55 min\n\nSo, the time they meet is 7:56 am, which is 56 minutes after 7 am. So the answer is D.\n\n\nTo determine the time when the two trains cross each other, we analyze their movements:\n\n1. **Train M** leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9 am, taking 4 hours. Its speed is therefore \\( \\frac{D}{4} \\), where \\( D \\) is the distance between the cities.\n\n2. **Train N** leaves City B at 7 am and reaches City A at 10:30 am, taking 3.5 hours. Its speed is \\( \\frac{2D}{7} \\).\n\n3. By 7 am, Train M has already traveled for 2 hours, covering \\( \\frac{D}{4} \\times 2 = \\frac{D}{2} \\). At this point, the remaining distance between the two trains is \\( D - \\frac{D}{2} = \\frac{D}{2} \\).\n\n4. From 7 am onward, both trains move towards each other. Let \\( t \\) be the time in hours after 7 am when they meet. The distance covered by Train M during this time is \\( \\frac{D}{4} \\cdot t \\), and the distance covered by Train N is \\( \\frac{2D}{7} \\cdot t \\). The sum of these distances equals the remaining distance \\( \\frac{D}{2} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{D}{4} \\cdot t + \\frac{2D}{7} \\cdot t = \\frac{D}{2}.\n   \\]\n\n5. Factoring out \\( D \\) and \\( t \\), and simplifying:\n   \\[\n   t \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{2}{7} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}.\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   t \\cdot \\frac{15}{28} = \\frac{1}{2}.\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( t \\):\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{28}{15} = \\frac{14}{15} \\text{ hours}.\n   \\]\n   Converting \\( \\frac{14}{15} \\) hours to minutes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{14}{15} \\cdot 60 = 56 \\text{ minutes}.\n   \\]\n\n6. Since \\( t = 56 \\) minutes, the trains meet 56 minutes after 7 am, which is at **7:56 am**.\n\nFrom the given options:\n- **A)** 1 hr 23 min\n- **B)** 1 hr 15 min\n- **C)** 1 hr 8 min\n- **D)** 56 min\n- **E)** 55 min\n\nThe correct answer is **D) 56 min**.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out when these two trains cross each other. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nSo, there's train M leaving City A at 5 am and arriving at City B at 9 am. That means it takes 4 hours to go from A to B. Then there's train N, which leaves City B at 7 am and arrives in City A at 10:30 am. So train N's journey takes 3.5 hours because from 7 to 10:30 is 3 and a half hours.\n\nI think the first thing I should do is find out the speeds of both trains. Because knowing their speeds will help me figure out how far each has traveled at a given time and when their paths cross.\n\nLet's assume the distance between City A and City B is D. That way, I can express their speeds in terms of D.\n\nFor train M:\nIt travels from A to B in 4 hours. So speed = distance/time. So speed of M is D/4 per hour.\n\nFor train N:\nIt goes from B to A in 3.5 hours. So its speed is D/(3.5) per hour. Wait, 3.5 is the same as 7/2, so D divided by 7/2 is (2D)/7 per hour.\n\nNow, I need to figure out when they meet. Let's think about their timelines. Both trains are moving towards each other, so their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds.\n\nBut wait, they don't start at the same time. Train M leaves at 5 am, and train N leaves at 7 am. So there's a 2-hour gap before they both are on the track moving towards each other.\n\nHmm, so from 5 am to 7 am, train M is already on its way. Let me calculate how far train M has traveled by 7 am. Since it's been 2 hours, the distance covered would be speed * time. So (D/4) * 2 = D/2. So at 7 am, when train N starts, train M is halfway between A and B.\n\nNow, from 7 am onwards, both trains are moving towards each other. Let me denote the time after 7 am as t hours. So during this time, train M will cover (D/4)*t, and train N will cover (2D/7)*t.\n\nThe sum of these two distances plus the D/2 that M has already covered should equal D, because together they meet when their combined distances add up to the total distance.\n\nWait, let me think again. At 7 am, M is at D/2 from A. Then, from 7 am onwards, as time t passes, M moves another (D/4)*t towards B, and N moves (2D/7)*t towards A. The point where they meet will be when the sum of the distances they've covered after 7 am plus M's initial D/2 equals D.\n\nSo the equation would be:\n\n(D/2) + (D/4)*t + (2D/7)*t = D\n\nLet me solve this equation for t.\n\nFirst, subtract D/2 from both sides:\n\n(D/4)*t + (2D/7)*t = D - D/2 = D/2\n\nFactor out D*t:\n\nt [ (1/4) + (2/7) ] = D/(2)\n\nWait, no, because D is the same, perhaps I can factor that out. Let me compute the coefficients.\n\n(1/4) + (2/7) = (7 + 8)/(28) = 15/28.\n\nSo, t * (15/28) = (D/2) / D?\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me correct that. The equation after subtracting D/2 is:\n\n(D/4)*t + (2D/7)*t = D/2\n\nFactor out D*t:\n\nD*t (1/4 + 2/7) = D/2\n\nDivide both sides by D (assuming D is not zero):\n\nt (1/4 + 2/7) = 1/2\n\nCalculate 1/4 + 2/7: common denominator is 28. So 7/28 + 8/28 = 15/28.\n\nSo:\n\nt * (15/28) = 1/2\n\nMultiply both sides by 28/15:\n\nt = (1/2) * (28/15) = 14/15 hours.\n\nHmm, 14/15 hours is how much in minutes? Well, 1 hour is 60 minutes, so 14/15 *60 = (14*4) = 56 minutes.\n\nSo t is 56 minutes. So from 7 am, adding 56 minutes would be 7:56 am.\n\nWait, but the options given are in terms of time differences, not absolute times. Let me check the options.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)1 hr 23 min \u2192 83 minutes\nB)1 hr 15 min \u219275\nC)1 hr 8 min \u219268\nD)56 min \u219256\nE)55 min \u219255\n\nWait, the calculation gives t as 56 minutes after 7 am, which would make the crossing time 7:56 am. But the options don't list times; they just give the duration from the starting points.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The options are the time taken from when each train started? Or perhaps the question is asking how much time after 7 am the meeting occurs. Because if so, then the answer would be 56 minutes, which is option D.\n\nBut let me re-express the problem differently. Maybe I should think about their positions as functions of time and see where they meet.\n\nAnother approach is to set up a timeline. Let me define the time variable as T, measured in hours from 5 am.\n\nSo at T=0 (5 am), train M is at A.\n\nAt T=2 hours (7 am), train N starts from B.\n\nSo, for T >=2, both are moving towards each other.\n\nThe position of M at time T is (D/4)*T, because it's moving at D/4 per hour.\n\nThe position of N at time T is (since it started at T=2), (2D/7)*(T-2). Because N has been traveling for (T-2) hours.\n\nThey meet when their positions add up to D.\n\nSo:\n\n(D/4)*T + (2D/7)*(T-2) = D\n\nDivide both sides by D:\n\n(T/4) + (2/7)(T-2) = 1\n\nMultiply all terms by 28 to eliminate denominators:\n\n7T + 8(T-2) = 28\n\nExpand:\n\n7T + 8T -16 =28 \u2192 15T -16=28 \u219215T=44 \u2192 T=44/15 \u22482.9333 hours.\n\nWhich is 2 hours and (0.9333 *60)=56 minutes.\n\nSo T=2 hours and 56 minutes. Which is 5 am + 2h56m =7:56 am.\n\nSo the time they cross is 7:56 am.\n\nBut the options are the time taken after which they meet. Wait, the question is asking at what time do they cross, so the absolute time is 7:56 am.\n\nBut looking at the options, the answer isn't listed as 7:56. The options are A to E, with E being 55 minutes. Wait, but in the initial problem statement, the options are labeled as A)1 hr 23 min, etc., but perhaps the options are the time difference from 5 am or 7 am?\n\nWait, the options are presented as possible durations, but the question is asking for the time when they cross, not the duration since a specific time.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the options. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question says: \"At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?\" So the answer should be a specific time, but the options are given as time intervals, not specific times. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Wait, looking back, the options are:\n\nA)1 hr 23 min\nB)1 hr 15 min\nC)1 hr 8 min\nD)56 min\nE)55 min\n\nWait, maybe the options represent the time each train takes to meet, but that doesn't fit because each train's journey time is longer. Or perhaps the options are the time taken from 7 am when both are moving towards each other, meaning 56 minutes is option D.\n\nWait, but according to our calculation, the time after 7 am is 56 minutes, which is option D.\n\nSo the answer should be D)56 min.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the time was 7:56 am, which is 56 minutes after 7 am. So the answer is D.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about two trains crossing each other. Let's see, I'll try to visualize it and think through it step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says Train M leaves City A at 5 am and arrives in City B at 9 am. So that's a total travel time of 4 hours. So the distance between City A and City B must be covered by M in 4 hours. I guess I'll call that distance D. So, D = speed of M * 4 hours. But I don't know the speed yet, but maybe I can find the ratio between the speeds of the two trains.\n\nThen there's Train N. It leaves City B at 7 am and arrives in City A at 10:30 am. Wait, 10:30 is the same as 10.5 hours in 24-hour time, but maybe I should just calculate the duration. So from 7 am to 10:30 am is 3.5 hours. So Train N takes 3.5 hours to cover the same distance D. So, D = speed of N * 3.5 hours.\n\nWait, so both D's are the same, right? Because both are traveling between City A and B. So from that, I can find the ratio of their speeds. Let me write that:\n\nSpeed of M (let's call it S_M) = D / 4\nSpeed of N (S_N) = D / 3.5\n\nSo S_M / S_N = (D/4) / (D/3.5) ) = (3.5)/4 = 7/8. Wait, because 3.5 is 7/2, so 7/2 divided by 4 is 7/(2*4) = 7/8. So S_M is 7/8 of S_N. Hmm, wait, no. Wait, 3.5 divided by 4 is 0.875, which is 7/8. So S_M is (7/8) times S_N. Or, S_N is faster than S_M by 1/8th.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of their speeds. So let me assign variables. Let me say the distance between A and B is D. Then, speed of M is D/4. Speed of N is D/(3.5). So 3.5 hours is the same as 7/2 hours. So S_N = D/(7/2) = 2D/7.\n\nSo S_M is D/4, S_N is 2D/7. Let me find the ratio: S_M/S_N = (D/4)/(2D/7) = (7)/(8) = 7:8. So S_M : S_N = 7:8.\n\nWait, so that means in the same amount of time, N is faster than M. Because 8 is greater than 7. So N is faster.\n\nNow, the question is when do they cross each other. So I need to find the time they meet.\n\nLet me think about their schedules. Train M leaves A at 5 am. Train N leaves B at 7 am. So M has a two-hour head start before N starts moving.\n\nWait, no. Wait, M leaves A at 5 am and is traveling towards B. N leaves B at 7 am, so two hours after M has started. So during those two hours, how far has M gone?\n\nIn those two hours, M has traveled a distance of S_M * 2 hours. So S_M is D/4, so 2*(D/4) = D/2. So by 7 am, when N starts, M is already D/2 away from A, which is halfway to B.\n\nWait, but D is the total distance. So M is at D/2 at 7 am, and N starts from B towards A at 7 am.\n\nSo the remaining distance between them at 7 am is D - D/2 = D/2.\n\nWait, but both are moving towards each other. So their speeds add up. So the relative speed is S_M + S_N.\n\nWait, so the time taken from 7 am until they meet would be the distance between them at 7 am divided by their combined speed.\n\nSo the distance at 7 am is D/2. The combined speed is S_M + S_N.\n\nSo time = (D/2) / (S_M + S_N)\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nS_M = D/4, S_N = 2D/7.\n\nSo S_M + S_N = (D/4) + (2D/7) = (7D + 8D)/(28) )= 15D/28.\n\nSo time = (D/2) / (15D/28) ) = (D/2) * (28/(15D)) ) = (28)/(30) = 14/15 hours.\n\nWait, 14/15 hours is how many minutes? 14/15 * 60 = 56 minutes. So 56 minutes after 7 am. So the time would be 7:56 am.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure. So from 7 am, adding 56 minutes, that's 7:56.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, the options are given as times, like option D is 56 min, but I think the options are the time after a certain point, but maybe not. Wait, let me check the options again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)1 hr 23 min\nB)1 hr 15 min\nC)1 hr 8 min\nD)56 min\nE)55 min\n\nWait, so option D is 56 minutes, which is what I calculated. So the time they cross is 56 minutes after 7 am, which is 7:56 am.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes when two objects are moving towards each other, the time when they meet is calculated from when both have started moving.\n\nIn this case, M has a two-hour head start. So from 5 am to 7 am, M has traveled D/2. Then from 7 am, both are moving towards each other. The distance between them is D/2, and their combined speed is S_M + S_N = D/4 + 2D/7 = (7D + 8D)/28 = 15D/28.\n\nSo the time to meet after 7 am is (D/2) / (15D/28) )= (D/2) * (28/(15D)) )= (28)/(30) )= 14/15 hours = 56 minutes.\n\nSo 56 minutes after 7 am is 7:56 am.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D is 56 min. So the answer should be D)56 min.\n\nWait, but another way to approach this could be to calculate the time each train travels until they meet and see when their positions coincide.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the time after 5 am when they meet. Let me try that.\n\nLet me let t be the time after 5 am until they meet. So M has been traveling for t hours. N has been traveling for (t - 2) hours, because N starts at 7 am, which is 2 hours after 5 am.\n\nThe distance covered by M in t hours is S_M * t = (D/4) * t.\n\nThe distance covered by N in (t-2) hours is S_N * (t-2) = (2D/7) * (t-2).\n\nSince they meet, the sum of these distances should be D.\n\nSo (D/4) t + (2D/7)(t-2) = D.\n\nDivide both sides by D:\n\n(1/4) t + (2/7)(t - 2) = 1.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nMultiply each term by 28 to eliminate denominators.\n\n28*(1/4 t) = 7t\n28*(2/7 (t-2)) = 8(t-2)\n28*1 = 28\n\nSo:\n\n7t + 8(t-2) = 28\n7t +8t -16 =28\n15t -16=28\n15t=44\nt=44/15 hours.\n\n44/15 hours is 2 and 14/15 hours, which is 2 hours plus (14/15)*60 minutes.\n\n14/15 of an hour is 56 minutes, so t is 2 hours and 56 minutes after 5 am.\n\nWait, that can't be right, because 5 am plus 2 hours is 7 am, plus 56 minutes would make it 7:56 am, which matches the previous calculation.\n\nBut wait, when I set t as the time after 5 am, then the time they meet is 5 am + 2h56m = 7:56 am. So that's consistent.\n\nBut in this case, the time taken after 7 am is 56 minutes, which is the same as the 56 minutes in option D.\n\nSo the correct answer is D)56 min.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about two trains crossing each other. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it slow.\n\nSo, the problem says: Train M leaves City A at 5 am and arrives in City B at 9 am. That means it took 4 hours to go from A to B. Train N leaves City B at 7 am and arrives in City A at 10:30 am, so that's 3.5 hours or 3 hours and 30 minutes. I need to find the time when they cross each other.\n\nHmm, I remember something about relative speed when two objects are moving towards each other. Maybe I should calculate their speeds and see when they meet.\n\nWait, but first, I need to figure out the distance between the cities. Oh, right, but since both trains are traveling the same distance, maybe I can express their speeds in terms of that distance.\n\nLet me denote the distance between A and B as D. So, for train M, its speed would be D divided by the time it takes. Time is from 5 am to 9 am, which is 4 hours. So speed of M is D/4.\n\nTrain N leaves at 7 am and takes until 10:30 am, which is 3.5 hours. So its speed is D divided by 3.5 hours. That's D/(3.5) = 2D/7 if I simplify it.\n\nNow, I think the next step is to find out when they meet. Since they're moving towards each other, their speeds add up. But wait, I need to consider the time each has been traveling when they meet.\n\nWait, let's think about their departure times. Train M starts at 5 am, while train N starts at 7 am. So, by the time train N starts, train M has already been traveling for 2 hours. In those 2 hours, how far has M gone?\n\nIn 2 hours, M would have covered (D/4) * 2 = D/2. So, the distance between them when N starts is D - D/2 = D/2. \n\nWait, no. Wait, no, because M is moving towards B, and N is moving towards A. So when N starts at 7 am, M is already D/2 away from A. So the distance between M and N at 7 am is D - (D/4 * 2) = D - (D/2) = D/2. So the remaining distance between them when N starts is D/2.\n\nNow, from 7 am onwards, both are moving towards each other. So their relative speed is (D/4 + 2D/7) per hour. Let me calculate that.\n\nD/4 is 0.25D, and 2D/7 is approximately 0.2857D. Adding them gives 0.5357D per hour. Wait, but maybe I should find a common denominator to add them accurately.\n\nLet me compute D/4 + 2D/7. The common denominator is 28, I think. So D/4 is 7D/28, and 2D/7 is 8D/28. So together, it's (7D + 8D)/28 = 15D/28. So the relative speed is 15D/28 per hour.\n\nThe distance between them at 7 am is D/2, so time taken until they meet is (D/2) divided by (15D/28). Let me compute that.\n\n(D/2) / (15D/28) = (D/2) * (28/(15D)) )= (28)/(30) )= 14/15 hours. Wait, 14 divided by 15 is 0.9333... hours. To convert that into minutes, 0.9333 *60 \u224856 minutes.\n\nWait, but wait a second. So the time taken after 7 am is 14/15 hours, which is 56 minutes. So they meet at 7 am plus 56 minutes, which is 7:56 am.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Another approach: Let me calculate how much time each train travels until they meet.\n\nLet me denote t as the time after 7 am until they meet. So, by then, train M has been traveling for t + 2 hours (since it started at 5 am). Train N has been traveling for t hours.\n\nThe distance covered by M until meeting: (D/4) * (t + 2)\nThe distance covered by N until meeting: (2D/7) * t\n\nSince together they cover the entire distance D, we have:\n\n(D/4)(t +2) + (2D/7) t = D\n\nDivide both sides by D:\n\n( (t+2)/4 ) + (2t/7 ) = 1\n\nMultiply both sides by 28 (the least common multiple of 4 and 7) to eliminate denominators:\n\n7(t+2) + 8t = 28\n\nExpand 7t +14 +8t =28\n\nCombine like terms: 15t +14 =28\n\n15t=14\n\nt=14/15 hours\n\nWhich is 56 minutes. So the meeting time is 7 am plus 56 minutes, which is 7:56 am.\n\nLooking at the options, the times are given as durations, but I think the question is asking for the time in terms of how much after a certain point. Wait, looking at the options, the options are A)1 hr 23 min, B)1 hr 15 min, etc. Wait, but wait the options are labeled as A to E, but the times are in hours and minutes, but how does that fit?\n\nWait, perhaps the options are the time after 5 am or 7 am? Or perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the options. Let me recheck the options.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)1 hr 23 min\nB)1 hr 15 min\nC)1 hr 8 min\nD)56 min\nE)55 min\n\nWait, so option D is 56 minutes. So the time after 7 am is 56 minutes, so 7:56 am. So the time they cross is 7:56 am, which is 56 minutes after 7 am.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 56 min. So the answer would be D.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Because when the problem says 'at what time do the two trains cross one another,' the answer would be the actual time, but the options don't have times like 7:56. So perhaps the options are the time difference from when one of the trains started.\n\nWait, in the options, all are time durations, so perhaps the correct answer is 56 minutes after 7 am, so option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the time taken from when train M started, which is 5 am. So 56 minutes after 7 am is 7:56 am. That's 1 hour and 56 minutes after 5 am. But none of the options have 1h56m. So perhaps I'm getting the approach wrong.\n\nWait another approach: maybe I should compute the position where they meet.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is to calculate the time each train has traveled until meeting.\n\nWait, let me think about the positions as functions of time.\n\nLet t be the time in hours after 5 am.\n\nSo, train M has been traveling for t hours, and its position from A is (D/4)*t.\n\nTrain N leaves at 7 am, which is t=2 (since 7-5=2 hours). So its travel time is t-2 hours when t >=2. So its position from B is (2D/7)*(t-2). Since the distance from A for N is D - (2D/7)*(t-2).\n\nThey meet when their positions from A are equal. So:\n\n(D/4) * t = D - (2D/7)(t-2)\n\nDivide both sides by D:\n\nt/4 = 1 - (2/7)(t-2)\n\nMultiply both sides by 28 to eliminate denominators:\n\n7t = 28 - 8(t-2)\n\n7t =28 -8t +16\n\n7t +8t =44\n\n15t=44\n\nt=44/15 hours.\n\nWhich is 2.9333 hours. 0.9333 hours is 56 minutes. So t=2 hours and 56 minutes. Since t is after 5 am, 2h56m after 5 am is 8:00 am minus 4 minutes, which is 7:56 am. So again, the meeting time is 7:56 am.\n\nSo from 7 am, it's 56 minutes. So option D is 56 min, so the answer is D.\n\nWait, but another way to think is, from when the second train starts at 7 am, how long until they meet. That's 56 minutes, so the time is 7:56 am. So the correct answer is 56 minutes after 7 am, which is option D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about two trains crossing each other. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it slow.\n\nSo, the problem says: Train M leaves City A at 5 am and arrives in City B at 9 am. That means it took 4 hours to go from A to B. Train N leaves City B at 7 am and arrives in City A at 10:30 am, so that's 3.5 hours or 3 hours and 30 minutes. I need to find the time when they cross each other.\n\nHmm, I remember something about relative speed when two objects are moving towards each other. Maybe I should calculate their speeds and see when they meet.\n\nWait, but first, I need to figure out the distance between the cities. Oh, right, but since both trains are traveling the same distance, maybe I can express their speeds in terms of that distance.\n\nLet me denote the distance between A and B as D. So, for train M, its speed would be D divided by the time it takes. Time is from 5 am to 9 am, which is 4 hours. So speed of M is D/4.\n\nTrain N leaves at 7 am and takes until 10:30 am, which is 3.5 hours. So its speed is D divided by 3.5 hours. That's D/(3.5) = 2D/7 if I simplify it.\n\nNow, I think the next step is to find out when they meet. Since they're moving towards each other, their speeds add up. But wait, I need to consider the time each has been traveling when they meet.\n\nWait, let's think about their departure times. Train M starts at 5 am, while train N starts at 7 am. So, by the time train N starts, train M has already been traveling for 2 hours. In those 2 hours, how far has M gone?\n\nIn 2 hours, M would have covered (D/4) * 2 = D/2. So, the distance between them when N starts is D - D/2 = D/2. \n\nWait, no. Wait, no, because M is moving towards B, and N is moving towards A. So when N starts at 7 am, M is already D/2 away from A. So the distance between M and N at 7 am is D - (D/4 * 2) = D - (D/2) = D/2. So the remaining distance between them when N starts is D/2.\n\nNow, from 7 am onwards, both are moving towards each other. So their relative speed is (D/4 + 2D/7) per hour. Let me calculate that.\n\nD/4 is 0.25D, and 2D/7 is approximately 0.2857D. Adding them gives 0.5357D per hour. Wait, but maybe I should find a common denominator to add them accurately.\n\nLet me compute D/4 + 2D/7. The common denominator is 28, I think. So D/4 is 7D/28, and 2D/7 is 8D/28. So together, it's (7D + 8D)/28 = 15D/28. So the relative speed is 15D/28 per hour.\n\nThe distance between them at 7 am is D/2, so time taken until they meet is (D/2) divided by (15D/28). Let me compute that.\n\n(D/2) / (15D/28) = (D/2) * (28/(15D)) )= (28)/(30) )= 14/15 hours. Wait, 14 divided by 15 is 0.9333... hours. To convert that into minutes, 0.9333 *60 \u224856 minutes.\n\nWait, but wait a second. So the time taken after 7 am is 14/15 hours, which is 56 minutes. So they meet at 7 am plus 56 minutes, which is 7:56 am.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Another approach: Let me calculate how much time each train travels until they meet.\n\nLet me denote t as the time after 7 am until they meet. So, by then, train M has been traveling for t + 2 hours (since it started at 5 am). Train N has been traveling for t hours.\n\nThe distance covered by M until meeting: (D/4) * (t + 2)\nThe distance covered by N until meeting: (2D/7) * t\n\nSince together they cover the entire distance D, we have:\n\n(D/4)(t +2) + (2D/7) t = D\n\nDivide both sides by D:\n\n( (t+2)/4 ) + (2t/7 ) = 1\n\nMultiply both sides by 28 (the least common multiple of 4 and 7) to eliminate denominators:\n\n7(t+2) + 8t = 28\n\nExpand 7t +14 +8t =28\n\nCombine like terms: 15t +14 =28\n\n15t=14\n\nt=14/15 hours\n\nWhich is 56 minutes. So the meeting time is 7 am plus 56 minutes, which is 7:56 am.\n\nLooking at the options, the times are given as durations, but I think the question is asking for the time in terms of how much after a certain point. Wait, looking at the options, the options are A)1 hr 23 min, B)1 hr 15 min, etc. Wait, but wait the options are labeled as A to E, but the times are in hours and minutes, but how does that fit?\n\nWait, perhaps the options are the time after 5 am or 7 am? Or perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the options. Let me recheck the options.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)1 hr 23 min\nB)1 hr 15 min\nC)1 hr 8 min\nD)56 min\nE)55 min\n\nWait, so option D is 56 minutes. So the time after 7 am is 56 minutes, so 7:56 am. So the time they cross is 7:56 am, which is 56 minutes after 7 am.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 56 min. So the answer would be D.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Because when the problem says 'at what time do the two trains cross one another,' the answer would be the actual time, but the options don't have times like 7:56.

So perhaps I'm getting the approach wrong.\n\nWait another approach: maybe I should compute the position where they meet.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is to calculate the time each train has traveled until meeting.\n\nWait, let me think about the positions as functions of time.\n\nLet t be the time in hours after 5 am.\n\nSo, train M has been traveling for t hours, and its position from A is (D/4)*t.\n\nTrain N leaves at 7 am, which is t=2 (since 7-5=2 hours). So its travel time is t-2 hours when t >=2. So its position from B is (2D/7)*(t-2). Since the distance from A for N is D - (2D/7)*(t-2).\n\nThey meet when their positions from A are equal. So:\n\n(D/4) * t = D - (2D/7)(t-2)\n\nDivide both sides by D:\n\nt/4 = 1 - (2/7)(t-2)\n\nMultiply both sides by 28 to eliminate denominators:\n\n7t = 28 - 8(t-2)\n\n7t =28 -8t +16\n\n7t +8t =44\n\n15t=44\n\nt=44/15 hours.\n\nWhich is 2.9333 hours. 0.9333 hours is 56 minutes. So t=2 hours and 56 minutes. Since t is after 5 am, 2h56m after 5 am is 8:00 am minus 4 minutes, which is 7:56 am. So again, the meeting time is 7:56 am.\n\nSo from 7 am, it's 56 minutes. So option D is 56 min, so the answer is D.\n\nWait, but another way to think is, from when the second train starts at 7 am, how long until they meet. That's 56 minutes, so the time is 7:56 am. So the correct answer is 56 minutes after 7 am, which is option D.\n\n\nTo determine the time at which the two trains cross each other, we analyze their speeds and the distance between the cities.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about two trains crossing each other, and I need to figure out when that happens. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. \n\nAlright, the problem says Train M leaves City A at 5 am and arrives in City B at 9 am. So, that's a four-hour journey. Train N leaves City B at 7 am and arrives in City A at 10:30 am, which is a three and a half-hour trip. I need to find out when they cross each other.\n\nWait, so I should probably start by figuring out the speeds of both trains. Because knowing their speeds will help me determine how long it takes for them to meet.\n\nLet me denote the distance between City A and City B as D. I think I can assume it's the same distance for both trains since they're traveling between the same two cities.\n\nSo for Train M: it travels from A to B in 4 hours. So its speed would be D divided by 4, which is D/4 per hour.\n\nFor Train N: it travels from B to A, covering the same distance D, but it takes 3.5 hours. So its speed is D divided by 3.5. Let me calculate that. 3.5 hours is the same as 7/2 hours, so D divided by (7/2) is D multiplied by 2/7. So, speed is (2D)/7 per hour.\n\nNow, I need to figure out the time when they meet. But wait, the trains are leaving at different times. Train M leaves at 5 am, and Train N leaves at 7 am. So, by the time Train N starts moving, Train M has already been traveling for two hours.\n\nSo, in those two hours, how far has Train M gone? Let's see, speed is D/4 per hour. So in 2 hours, it would have covered (D/4)*2 = D/2. So, the distance between the two trains when Train N starts at 7 am is D minus D/2, which is D/2.\n\nNow, both trains are moving towards each other. So, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. That's D/4 + (2D)/7. Let me compute that.\n\nD/4 is the same as 7D/28, and (2D)/7 is 8D/28. Adding them together: 7D/28 + 8D/28 = 15D/28. So the combined speed is 15D/28 per hour.\n\nThe distance between them at 7 am is D/2. So the time it takes for them to meet after 7 am is the distance divided by their combined speed. That would be (D/2) divided by (15D/28). \n\nLet me compute that. The D cancels out, so (1/2) / (15/28) = (1/2) * (28/15) = 14/15 hours. Hmm, 14 divided by 15 is approximately 0.9333 hours. To convert that into minutes, I multiply by 60: 0.9333 *60 \u2248 56 minutes. \n\nWait, but wait a second. So the time they meet is 56 minutes after 7 am. So 7 am plus 56 minutes is 7:56 am.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 56 minutes, and option E is 55. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, the relative speed calculation: D/4 + 2D/7. Let me compute that again. \n\nD/4 is 0.25D, and 2D/7 is approximately 0.2857D. Adding them gives about 0.5357D per hour. The distance between them at 7 am is D/2, which is 0.5D. So time taken would be 0.5D / 0.5357D = approximately 0.9333 hours, which is 56 minutes. So that part seems correct.\n\nWait, but the answer options don't have 7:56 am as an option. Wait, the options are A)1 hr 23 min, B)1 hr 15 min, C)1 hr 8 min, D)56 min, E)55 min. Oh, I see, the options are giving the time in minutes after the starting time or something else? Or perhaps the question is just asking for the duration after 7 am. Wait, the question says \"at what time do the two trains cross one another?\" So the answer would be 7:56 am, but the options are in terms of time durations, like 56 minutes, not the actual time.\n\nWait, looking back, the options are just the time difference, not the actual time. Because the options are like 1 hr 23 min, etc. So the correct answer would be 56 minutes after 7 am, which is option D)56 min.\n\nBut wait, another way to approach this problem is to consider their positions as functions of time. Let me set up equations for each train's position.\n\nLet\u2019s define t as the time after 5 am.\n\nFor Train M, which leaves at 5 am:\n- Speed = D/4 per hour.\n- Position at time t (where t >=5 am) is (D/4)*t.\n\nFor Train N, which leaves at 7 am (so t = 2 hours after 5 am):\n- It starts moving at t = 2.\n- Speed = 2D/7 per hour.\n- Position as a function of t is (2D/7)*(t-2), but only for t >=2.\n\nThey meet when their positions are equal. So:\n\n(D/4) * t = (2D/7) * (t - 2)\n\nDivide both sides by D:\n\n(1/4) t = (2/7)(t - 2)\n\nMultiply both sides by 28 to eliminate denominators:\n\n7t = 8(t - 2)\n\n7t = 8t -16\n\n7t -8t = -16\n\n- t = -16\n\nt =16 hours? Wait, that can't be right because the trains would have met earlier.\n\nWait, that can't be correct. So where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, no, because t is the time after 5 am, so when t=16, that's 16 hours after 5 am, which is 9 pm. But both trains have already reached their destinations before that. Train M arrives at 9 am, and Train N arrives at 10:30 am.\n\nWait, so my equations must be wrong. Maybe I mixed up the positions.\n\nWait, no, the positions should be from the starting points. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I should model the distance from City A. So for Train M, moving from A to B: position from A is (D/4)*t.\n\nFor Train N, moving from B to A: it starts at B (so position D from A) and moves towards A. So its position from A as a function of time is D - (2D/7)*(t-2), for t >=2.\n\nSo the equation when they meet is:\n\n(D/4)*t = D - (2D/7)(t-2)\n\nDivide both sides by D:\n\n(1/4) t = 1 - (2/7)(t-2)\n\nMultiply both sides by 28 to eliminate denominators:\n\n7t = 28 - 8(t-2)\n\n7t =28 -8t +16\n\n7t +8t =44\n\n15t=44\n\nt=44/15 = 2.9333 hours.\n\nWhich is 2 hours and 56 minutes after 5 am. So 5 am + 2h56m is 7:56 am.\n\nSo the time they meet is at 7:56 am. The question is, which option corresponds to the time after 7 am? Because the options are in terms of minutes, perhaps the time after 7 am.\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA)1 hr 23 min \u2192 83 minutes\n\nB)1 hr 15 min \u219275\n\nC)1 hr 8 min \u219268\n\nD)56 min \u219256\n\nE)55 min \u219255\n\nSince the meeting occurs 56 minutes after 7 am, the correct answer would be D)56 min.\n\nBut wait, another approach: perhaps I made a mistake in the relative speeds. Let me try another method.\n\nThe total distance is D. Train M's speed is D/4, so in 2 hours (before Train N starts), it's covered D/2. So the distance between them at 7 am is D/2.\n\nNow, the combined speed is (D/4 + 2D/7) = (7D +8D)/(28) )=15D/28 per hour.\n\nTime to cover D/2 at 15D/28 per hour: (D/2) / (15D/28) )= (1/2) * (28/(15)) )=14/15 hours.\n\n14/15 hours is 56 minutes (since 14*4=56, 15*4=60; 56/4=14, 60/4=15). So yes, 56 minutes after 7 am. So the time they meet is 7:56 am, which is 56 minutes after 7 am.\n\nSo the answer should be D)56 min.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about two trains crossing each other, and I need to figure out when that happens. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. \n\nAlright, the problem says Train M leaves City A at 5 am and arrives in City B at 9 am. So, that's a four-hour journey. Train N leaves City B at 7 am and arrives in City A at 10:30 am, which is a three and a half-hour trip. I need to find out when they cross each other.\n\nWait, so I should probably start by figuring out the speeds of both trains. Because knowing their speeds will help me determine how long it takes for them to meet.\n\nLet me denote the distance between City A and City B as D. I think I can assume it's the same distance for both trains since they're traveling between the same two cities.\n\nSo for Train M: it travels from A to B in 4 hours. So its speed would be D divided by 4, which is D/4 per hour.\n\nFor Train N: it travels from B to A, covering the same distance D, but it takes 3.5 hours. So its speed is D divided by 3.5. Let me calculate that. 3.5 hours is the same as 7/2 hours, so D divided by (7/2) is D multiplied by 2/7. So, speed is (2D)/7 per hour.\n\nNow, I need to figure out the time when they meet. But wait, the trains are leaving at different times. Train M leaves at 5 am, and Train N leaves at 7 am. So, by the time Train N starts moving, Train M has already been traveling for two hours.\n\nSo, in those two hours, how far has Train M gone? Let's see, speed is D/4 per hour. So in 2 hours, it would have covered (D/4)*2 = D/2. So, the distance between the two trains when Train N starts at 7 am is D minus D/2, which is D/2.\n\nNow, both trains are moving towards each other. So, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. That's D/4 + (2D)/7. Let me compute that.\n\nD/4 is the same as 7D/28, and (2D)/7 is 8D/28. Adding them together: 7D/28 + 8D/28 = 15D/28. So the combined speed is 15D/28 per hour.\n\nThe distance between them at 7 am is D/2. So the time it takes for them to meet after 7 am is the distance divided by their combined speed. That would be (D/2) divided by (15D/28). \n\nLet me compute that. The D cancels out, so (1/2) / (15/28) = (1/2) * (28/15) = 14/15 hours. Hmm, 14 divided by 15 is approximately 0.9333 hours. To convert that into minutes, I multiply by 60: 0.9333 *60 \u2248 56 minutes. \n\nWait, but wait a second. So the time they meet is 56 minutes after 7 am. So 7 am plus 56 minutes is 7:56 am.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 56 minutes, and option E is 55. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, the relative speed calculation: D/4 + 2D/7. Let me compute that again. \n\nD/4 is 0.25D, and 2D/7 is approximately 0.2857D. Adding them gives about 0.5357D per hour. The distance between them at 7 am is D/2, which is 0.5D. So time taken would be 0.5D / 0.5357D = approximately 0.9333 hours, which is 56 minutes. So that part seems correct.\n\nWait, but the answer options don't have 7:56 am as an option. Wait, the options are A)1 hr 23 min, B)1 hr 15 min, C)1 hr 8 min, D)56 min, E)55 min. Oh, I see, the options are giving the time in minutes after the starting time or something else? Or perhaps the question is just asking for the duration after 7 am. Wait, the question says \"at what time do the two trains cross one another?\" So the answer would be 7:56 am, but the options are in terms of time durations, like 56 minutes, not the actual time.\n\nWait, looking back, the options are just the time difference, not the actual time. Because the options are like 1 hr 23 min, etc. So the correct answer would be 56 minutes after 7 am, which is option D)56 min.\n\nBut wait, another way to approach this problem is to consider their positions as functions of time. Let me set up equations for each train's position.\n\nLet\u2019s define t as the time after 5 am.\n\nFor Train M, which leaves at 5 am:\n- Speed = D/4 per hour.\n- Position at time t (where t >=5 am) is (D/4)*t.\n\nFor Train N, which leaves at 7 am (so t = 2 hours after 5 am):\n- It starts moving at t = 2.\n- Speed = 2D/7 per hour.\n- Position as a function of t is (2D/7)*(t-2), but only for t >=2.\n\nThey meet when their positions are equal. So:\n\n(D/4) * t = (2D/7) * (t - 2)\n\nDivide both sides by D:\n\n(1/4) t = (2/7)(t - 2)\n\nMultiply both sides by 28 to eliminate denominators:\n\n7t = 8(t - 2)\n\n7t = 8t -16\n\n7t -8t = -16\n\n- t = -16\n\nt =16 hours? Wait, that can't be right because the trains would have met earlier.\n\nWait, that can't be correct. So where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, no, because t is the time after 5 am, so when t=16, that's 16 hours after 5 am, which is 9 pm. But both trains have already reached their destinations before that. Train M arrives at 9 am, and Train N arrives at 10:30 am.\n\nWait, so my equations must be wrong. Maybe I mixed up the positions.\n\nWait, no, the positions should be from the starting points. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I should model the distance from City A. So for Train M, moving from A to B: position from A is (D/4)*t.\n\nFor Train N, moving from B to A: it starts at B (so position D from A) and moves towards A. So its position from A as a function of time is D - (2D/7)*(t-2), for t >=2.\n\nSo the equation when they meet is:\n\n(D/4)*t = D - (2D/7)(t-2)\n\nDivide both sides by D:\n\n(1/4) t = 1 - (2/7)(t-2)\n\nMultiply both sides by 28 to eliminate denominators:\n\n7t = 28 - 8(t-2)\n\n7t =28 -8t +16\n\n7t +8t =44\n\n15t=44\n\nt=44/15 = 2.9333 hours.\n\nWhich is 2 hours and 56 minutes after 5 am. So 5 am + 2h56m is 7:56 am.\n\nSo the time they meet is at 7:56 am. The question is, which option corresponds to the time after 7 am? Because the options are in terms of minutes, perhaps the time after 7 am.\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA)1 hr 23 min \u2192 83 minutes\n\nB)1 hr 15 min \u219275\n\nC)1 hr 8 min \u219268\n\nD)56 min \u219256\n\nE)55 min \u219255\n\nSince the meeting occurs 56 minutes after 7 am, the correct answer would be D)56 min.\n\nBut wait, another approach: perhaps I made a mistake in the relative speeds. Let me try another method.\n\nThe total distance is D. Train M's speed is D/4, so in 2 hours (before Train N starts), it's covered D/2. So the distance between them at 7 am is D/2.\n\nNow, the combined speed is (D/4 + 2D/7) = (7D +8D)/(28) )=15D/28 per hour.\n\nTime to cover D/2 at 15D/28 per hour: (D/2) / (15D/28) )= (1/2) * (28/(15)) )=14/15 hours.\n\n14/15 hours is 56 minutes (since 14*4=56, 15*4=60; 56/4=14, 60/4=15). So yes, 56 minutes after 7 am. So the time they meet is 7:56 am, which is 56 minutes after 7 am.\n\nSo the answer should be D)56 min.\n\n\nTo determine when the two trains cross each other, we analyze their speeds and positions over time.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the speeds of the trains\n- **Train M** travels from City A to City B in 4 hours, so its speed is:\n  \\[\n  v_M = \\frac{D}{4} \\, \\text{per hour}.\n  \\]\n- **Train N** travels from City B to City A in 3.5 hours, so its speed is:\n  \\[\n  v_N = \\frac{D}{3.5} = \\frac{2D}{7} \\, \\text{per hour}.\n  \\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the distance between the trains at 7 am\nTrain M leaves City A at 5 am and travels for 2 hours before Train N starts at 7 am. In these 2 hours, Train M covers:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = v_M \\cdot 2 = \\frac{D}{4} \\cdot 2 = \\frac{D}{2}.\n\\]\nThus, the distance between the two trains at 7 am is:\n\\[\nD - \\frac{D}{2} = \\frac{D}{2}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the relative speed\nSince the trains are moving towards each other, their relative speed is:\n\\[\nv_{\\text{relative}} = v_M + v_N = \\frac{D}{4} + \\frac{2D}{7} = \\frac{7D}{28} + \\frac{8D}{28} = \\frac{15D}{28} \\, \\text{per hour}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Determine the time to meet after 7 am\nThe time it takes for the trains to meet after 7 am is the distance between them divided by their relative speed:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{v_{\\text{relative}}} = \\frac{\\frac{D}{2}}{\\frac{15D}{28}} = \\frac{D}{2} \\cdot \\frac{28}{15D} = \\frac{14}{15} \\, \\text{hours}.\n\\]\nConvert this time into minutes:\n\\[\n\\frac{14}{15} \\, \\text{hours} \\times 60 \\, \\text{minutes/hour} = 56 \\, \\text{minutes}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Determine the meeting time\nThe trains meet 56 minutes after 7 am, which is at **7:56 am**. However, the question asks for the time difference, so the answer is **56 minutes**.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe two trains cross each other **56 minutes** after 7 am.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about two trains crossing each other, and I need to figure out when they meet. Hmm, let me try to visualize this. \n\nSo, train M leaves City A at 5 am and arrives in City B at 9 am. That means it takes 4 hours to go from A to B. On the other hand, train N leaves City B at 7 am and gets to City A at 10:30 am, which is 3.5 hours. \n\nI think the first step is to find out the speeds of both trains. But wait, I don't have the distance between the cities. Oh right, maybe I can assume the distance is the same for both trains since they're traveling between the same two cities. Let's say the distance is D.\n\nSo for train M, the time taken is 4 hours. So its speed would be D divided by 4, which is D/4 per hour. For train N, the time is 3.5 hours, so its speed is D divided by 3.5. Let me calculate that: 3.5 is the same as 7/2, so D divided by (7/2) is 2D/7 per hour. \n\nNow, I need to figure out when they meet. But I have to consider their departure times because they don't leave at the same time. Train M starts at 5 am, and train N starts at 7 am. So there's a two-hour gap before they even start moving towards each other.\n\nWait, no. Actually, when does each train start moving? Let me think: Train M is moving from A to B, leaving at 5 am, arrives at 9 am. So it's moving for 4 hours. Train N leaves B at 7 am, arrives at A at 10:30 am, so it's moving for 3.5 hours.\n\nSo the key is to find the time when their combined distances equal the total distance D. But since they're moving towards each other, their relative speeds add up.\n\nWait, but I need to calculate how much time has passed since 5 am when they meet. Let me set up a timeline.\n\nLet me denote the time elapsed since 5 am as t hours. So, train M has been traveling for t hours. But what about train N? It starts at 7 am, which is 2 hours after 5 am. So if the meeting happens at time t (since 5 am), then train N has been traveling for (t - 2) hours, but only if t is greater than 2. If t is less than 2, N hasn't started yet.\n\nSo, the distance covered by M is (D/4) * t. The distance covered by N is (2D/7) * (t - 2). The sum of these distances should be equal to D when they meet.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n(D/4)*t + (2D/7)*(t - 2) = D\n\nI can divide both sides by D to simplify:\n\n(1/4)t + (2/7)(t - 2) = 1\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n(1/4)t is the first term.\n\nThe second term: (2/7)(t - 2) = (2/7)t - 4/7.\n\nSo adding both terms:\n\n(1/4)t + (2/7)t - 4/7 = 1\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(1/4 + 2/7) t = 1 + 4/7\n\nWait, no, wait. Let's correct that. The left side is (1/4)t + (2/7)(t - 2) = 1. So after expanding, it's (1/4)t + (2/7)t - (4/7) = 1.\n\nSo combining the t terms: (1/4 + 2/7) t = 1 + 4/7.\n\nCompute 1/4 + 2/7. Let's find a common denominator, which is 28.\n\n1/4 = 7/28, 2/7 = 8/28. So 7 +8 =15/28.\n\nSo (15/28) t = 1 + 4/7. What's 1 + 4/7? That's 11/7.\n\nSo, (15/28) t = 11/7.\n\nSolving for t:\n\nt = (11/7) * (28/15) = (11 * 28)/(7 *15)\n\nSimplify 28/7 is 4. So 11 *4 =44, 15 remains. So t=44/15 hours.\n\nWait, 44 divided by 15 is 2 and 14/15 hours. Let me convert 14/15 hours into minutes: 14/15 *60 = 56 minutes. So t is 2 hours and 56 minutes.\n\nSo since the time is measured from 5 am, adding 2h56m to 5 am gives us 7:56 am.\n\nWait, wait. Wait a second. Let me double-check the equation.\n\nWait, because the time when they meet is t hours after 5 am. So t=44/15 hours is approximately 2.9333 hours. Which is 2 hours plus 0.9333*60=56 minutes. So 2h56m after 5 am is 7:56 am.\n\nBut looking at the options, I don't see 7:56 as an option. The options are given in terms of time taken, not the actual time.\n\nWait, the options are A)1 hr 23 min, B)1 hr 15 min, C)1 hr 8 min, D)56 min, E)55 min. So perhaps the problem is asking for the duration from when the later train starts or something else.\n\nWait no, the question is: At what time do the two trains cross one another? So the options are in terms of time, but the options given are like 1 hr 23 min, which is 1 hour and 23 minutes. But wait, that can't be a time of day; perhaps it's the time after a certain point.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in how I set up the problem. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the relative speed approach is better. Let me think differently.\n\nThe time when train N starts is 7 am. At that moment, train M has already been traveling for 2 hours. So in those 2 hours, how much distance has M covered? \n\nM's speed is D/4 per hour. So in 2 hours, M has covered (D/4)*2 = D/2. So the remaining distance between them at 7 am is D - D/2 = D/2.\n\nNow, from 7 am onwards, both trains are moving towards each other. So the relative speed is the sum of their speeds: D/4 + 2D/7.\n\nLet me compute that. \n\nD/4 is 0.25D, 2D/7 is approximately 0.2857D. Adding them gives 0.5357D per hour. Or, more accurately, let's find a common denominator. 4 and 7: 28.\n\nD/4 =7D/28, 2D/7=8D/28. Sum is 15D/28 per hour.\n\nSo the time it takes for them to meet after 7 am is the remaining distance (D/2) divided by the relative speed (15D/28).\n\nSo time = (D/2) / (15D/28) = (D/2) * (28/(15D)) )= (28/(2*15)) )= 28/(30) = 14/15 hours.\n\n14/15 hours is equal to (14/15)*60 =56 minutes.\n\nSo they meet 56 minutes after 7 am, which is 8:56 am.\n\nBut looking at the options, the options are in minutes as times. So 56 minutes is option D.\n\nWait, but the options are presented as time durations. So the answer is 56 minutes after 7 am, which is 8:56 am. But the options are given as E)55 min, D)56 min, etc. So the correct answer would be 56 minutes, option D.\n\nWait, but in the initial approach, I calculated t=44/15 hours (2.9333 hours) after 5 am, which is 7:56 am. So that makes sense. So the time when they meet is 7:56 am, which is 56 minutes after 7 am.\n\nSo the answer is 56 minutes after 7 am, which is option D.\n",

So t is 2 hours and 56 minutes.\n\nSo since the time is measured from 5 am, adding 2h56m to 5 am gives us 7:56 am.\n\nWait, wait. Wait a second. Let me double-check the equation.\n\nWait, because the time when they meet is t hours after 5 am. So t=44/15 hours is approximately 2.9333 hours. Which is 2 hours plus 0.9333*60=56 minutes. So 2h56m after 5 am is 7:56 am.\n\nBut looking at the options, I don't see 7:56 as an option. The options are given in terms of time taken, not the actual time.\n\nWait, the options are A)1 hr 23 min, B)1 hr 15 min, C)1 hr 8 min, D)56 min, E)55 min. So perhaps the problem is asking for the duration from when the later train starts or something else.\n\nWait no, the question is: At what time do the two trains cross one another? So the options are in terms of time, but the options given are like 1 hr 23 min, which is 1 hour and 23 minutes. But wait, that can't be a time of day; perhaps it's the time after a certain point.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in how I set up the problem. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the relative speed approach is better. Let me think differently.\n\nThe time when train N starts is 7 am. At that moment, train M has already been traveling for 2 hours. So in those 2 hours, how much distance has M covered? \n\nM's speed is D/4 per hour. So in 2 hours, M has covered (D/4)*2 = D/2. So the remaining distance between them at 7 am is D - D/2 = D/2.\n\nNow, from 7 am onwards, both trains are moving towards each other. So the relative speed is the sum of their speeds: D/4 + 2D/7.\n\nLet me compute that. \n\nD/4 is 0.25D, 2D/7 is approximately 0.2857D. Adding them gives 0.5357D per hour. Or, more accurately, let's find a common denominator. 4 and 7: 28.\n\nD/4 =7D/28, 2D/7=8D/28. Sum is 15D/28 per hour.\n\nSo the time it takes for them to meet after 7 am is the remaining distance (D/2) divided by the relative speed (15D/28).\n\nSo time = (D/2) / (15D/28) = (D/2) * (28/(15D)) )= (28/(2*15)) )= 28/(30) = 14/15 hours.\n\n14/15 hours is equal to (14/15)*60 =56 minutes.\n\nSo they meet 56 minutes after 7 am, which is 8:56 am.\n\nBut looking at the options, the options are in minutes as times. So 56 minutes is option D.\n\nWait, but the options are presented as time durations. So the answer is 56 minutes after 7 am, which is 8:56 am. But the options are given as E)55 min, D)56 min, etc. So the correct answer would be 56 minutes, option D.\n\nWait, but in the initial approach, I calculated t=44/15 hours (2.9333 hours) after 5 am, which is 7:56 am. So that makes sense. So the time when they meet is 7:56 am, which is 56 minutes after 7 am.\n\nSo the answer is 56 minutes after 7 am, which is option D.\n\n\nTo determine the time at which the two trains cross each other, we analyze their speeds and departure times.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the speeds of the trains\n- **Train M** leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9 am, taking 4 hours. Its speed is:\n  \\[\n  v_M = \\frac{D}{4} \\, \\text{(where \\(D\\) is the distance between the cities)}.\n  \\]\n- **Train N** leaves City B at 7 am and reaches City A at 10:30 am, taking 3.5 hours. Its speed is:\n  \\[\n  v_N = \\frac{D}{3.5} = \\frac{2D}{7}.\n  \\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the relative motion\n- Train M starts at 5 am, while Train N starts at 7 am, meaning there is a 2-hour gap before both trains are moving toward each other.\n- By 7 am, Train M has already traveled for 2 hours at a speed of \\(v_M = \\frac{D}{4}\\). The distance covered by Train M in this time is:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Distance covered by M} = \\frac{D}{4} \\times 2 = \\frac{D}{2}.\n  \\]\n  Thus, the remaining distance between the trains at 7 am is:\n  \\[\n  D - \\frac{D}{2} = \\frac{D}{2}.\n  \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the time until they meet\nAfter 7 am, both trains are moving toward each other. Their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds:\n\\[\nv_{\\text{relative}} = v_M + v_N = \\frac{D}{4} + \\frac{2D}{7}.\n\\]\nTo combine these, find a common denominator:\n\\[\nv_{\\text{relative}} = \\frac{7D}{28} + \\frac{8D}{28} = \\frac{15D}{28}.\n\\]\nThe time it takes for the trains to meet after 7 am is the remaining distance divided by their relative speed:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{\\frac{D}{2}}{\\frac{15D}{28}} = \\frac{D}{2} \\times \\frac{28}{15D} = \\frac{28}{30} = \\frac{14}{15} \\, \\text{hours}.\n\\]\nConvert this time into minutes:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{14}{15} \\times 60 = 56 \\, \\text{minutes}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Determine the meeting time\nSince the trains meet 56 minutes after 7 am, the time they cross each other is:\n\\[\n7:00 \\, \\text{am} + 56 \\, \\text{minutes} = 8:56 \\, \\text{am}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Match with the options\nThe problem asks for the time they cross each other, and the options are given in minutes. Since the meeting time is 56 minutes after 7 am, the correct answer is:\n**D) 56 min.**\n\nAnswer: D",
