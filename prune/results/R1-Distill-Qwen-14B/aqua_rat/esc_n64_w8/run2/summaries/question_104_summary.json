      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the problem is about pricing a sewing machine with a certain profit margin after a discount. Hmm, Karan bought the machine for Rs. 1200. He wants to set a price such that even after giving a 20% discount, he still makes a 20% profit. \n\nWait, so the goal is to find the marked price. Let me break this down. I think I need to calculate the selling price first, which is after the discount, and then work backwards to find the marked price.\n\nRight, so the cost price is Rs. 1200. He wants a 20% profit on this. So the selling price should be 20% more than the cost. Let me calculate that. 20% of 1200 is (20/100)*1200 = 240. So the selling price should be 1200 + 240 = Rs. 1440.\n\nWait, but this selling price is after the discount. So the marked price is the original price before the discount. Since the discount is 20%, the selling price is 80% of the marked price. Oh right, because 100% minus 20% discount leaves 80% of the marked price.\n\nSo if SP = Marked Price \u00d7 (1 - discount rate). Here, the discount rate is 20%, so 0.2. So SP = MP \u00d7 0.8.\n\nWe know the SP is Rs. 1440. So, 1440 = MP \u00d7 0.8. To find MP, divide 1440 by 0.8. Let me compute that: 1440 / 0.8 equals... 1440 divided by 8/10 is 1440 * (10/8) = 1440 * 1.25. Hmm, 1440 * 1 is 1440, 1440 * 0.25 is 360, so 1440 + 360 = 1800. So the marked price is Rs. 1800.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 1800. But wait, let me double-check because sometimes these problems can be tricky. Oh wait, no, the options given are A)1,879; B)1,875; C)1,876; D)1,872; E)1,800.\n\nWait, so 1800 is option E. So that should be the correct answer.\n",

I'm a bit rusty on profit and discount calculations, but I'll think it through.\n\nAlright, the problem says that the cost price for Karan is Rs. 1200. He wants to mark the price in such a way that after offering a 20% discount, he still makes a 20% profit. Hmm, okay.\n\nWait, so the cost is Rs. 1200. He wants a 20% profit on that. So first, I should calculate what his selling price should be after the discount, right? Because the selling price after discount should give him that 20% profit.\n\nWait, profit is usually calculated on the cost price. So, 20% profit on Rs. 1200. Let me compute that. 20% of 1200 is (20/100)*1200 = 240. So the selling price after discount should be cost plus profit, which is 1200 + 240 = 1440. So he needs to sell it for Rs. 1440 after the discount.\n\nBut wait, the discount is 20%, so that's on the marked price. Let me think. The selling price after discount is 80% of the marked price because 20% discount means you're paying 80% of the original. So, if the selling price after discount is 1440, then that's 80% of the marked price.\n\nLet me represent the marked price as M. So, 80% of M is 1440. In equation form, that's 0.8 * M = 1440. So to find M, I need to divide 1440 by 0.8.\n\nWait, what's 1440 divided by 0.8? Let me calculate. 0.8 is 4/5, so dividing by 0.8 is the same as multiplying by 5/4. So 1440 * 5 = 7200, divided by 4 is 1800. So M is 1800?\n\nWait, but that can't be right because looking at the options, 1800 is option E. But I think I might have messed up somewhere. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no, wait. The cost is 1200, he wants a 20% profit on that, so 1200 * 1.2 is 1440. That's correct. Then, the selling price after discount is 1440, which is 80% of the marked price. So 1440 = 0.8 * M. So M is 1440 / 0.8. Let me compute that again. 1440 divided by 0.8: 1440 / 0.8 is 1800. So M is 1800, which is option E.\n\nWait, but the options include 1875 as option B. Maybe I did something wrong here. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the profit is calculated on the selling price after discount. Hmm, but that's not the usual way. Profit is typically calculated on cost, not on selling price. So I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nWait, let me recast the problem. He sells the machine for a price that's after a 20% discount. The selling price is such that his profit is 20% on the cost. So, the formula is:\n\nSelling Price = Cost + Profit\nProfit = 20% of Cost = 0.2 * 1200 = 240\nSo Selling Price = 1200 + 240 = 1440\n\nBut Selling Price is after a 20% discount. So, Selling Price = Marked Price - 20% of Marked Price = 80% of Marked Price.\n\nSo, 1440 = 0.8 * Marked Price\nMarked Price = 1440 / 0.8 = 1800\n\nSo the marked price is 1800. Which is option E.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option E is 1800, but the other options are higher. Hmm, but why would the marked price be lower than the selling price? Because the selling price is after a discount, so the marked price is higher than the selling price.\n\nWait, if the marked price is 1800, then 20% discount on that is 360. So 1800 - 360 = 1440, which is the selling price. That makes sense.\n\nSo yes, the correct answer should be E) 1800.\n\nWait, but why are the other options higher? Let me check if I made a mistake in the calculation. Perhaps I should model it differently.\n\nAnother approach: Let me denote the marked price as M. After a 20% discount, the selling price is 0.8*M. He wants the profit to be 20% on the cost, so profit is 0.2 * 1200 = 240. So selling price should be 1200 + 240 = 1440.\n\nSo, 0.8*M = 1440 \u2192 M = 1440 / 0.8 = 1800.

So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer is E) 1800.\n\n\nTo determine the marked price Karan should set for the sewing machine, we start by noting that the cost price is Rs. 1200, and Karan wants to make a 20% profit after offering a 20% discount. \n\n1. **Calculate the desired selling price after the discount**:  \n   Karan aims for a 20% profit on the cost price.  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit} = 0.2 \\times 1200 = 240\n   \\]  \n   Therefore, the selling price after the discount should be:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Selling Price} = \\text{Cost Price} + \\text{Profit} = 1200 + 240 = 1440\n   \\]\n\n2. **Relate the selling price to the marked price**:  \n   The selling price after a 20% discount is 80% of the marked price. Let \\( M \\) represent the marked price.  \n   \\[\n   0.8 \\times M = 1440\n   \\]  \n   Solving for \\( M \\):  \n   \\[\n   M = \\frac{1440}{0.8} = 1800\n   \\]\n\nThus, the marked price Karan should set is Rs. 1800. This ensures that after a 20% discount, he achieves a 20% profit on the cost price. The correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: E",

Hmm, the question is about pricing a product so that after giving a discount, he still makes a profit. \n\nAlright, the machine costs him Rs. 1200. He wants to mark it up such that when he offers a 20% discount, he still ends up making a 20% profit on his cost. Wait, so I need to find the marked price, right?\n\nLet me break it down. So, he sells it at 20% discount. That means he's selling it for 80% of the marked price. And that selling price should give him a 20% profit on his cost. His cost is Rs. 1200, so a 20% profit would be 1200 plus 20% of 1200.\n\nWait, wait. Let me clarify: the profit is on the cost price. So, profit is 20% of 1200. 20% of 1200 is 240, so his selling price needs to be 1200 + 240 = 1440. So, selling price (SP) is Rs. 1440.\n\nBut this SP is after giving a 20% discount on the marked price (MP). So, SP = MP - 20% of MP. Or, SP is 80% of MP. So, 0.8 * MP = 1440. \n\nTo find MP, I can rearrange that. MP = 1440 / 0.8. Let me calculate that. 1440 divided by 0.8 is the same as 1440 multiplied by 1.25. \n\nLet me compute that: 1440 * 1.25. Hmm, 1440 * 1 is 1440, and 1440 * 0.25 is 360. So adding them gives 1440 + 360 = 1800. So, the marked price should be Rs. 1800.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. So, if the marked price is 1800 and he gives a 20% discount, the selling price is 20% off. 20% of 1800 is 360, so selling price is 1800 - 360 = 1440. Then, cost is 1200, so profit is 1440 - 1200 = 240. 240 is 20% of 1200 (since 1200 * 0.2 = 240). So that's correct.\n\nLooking at the options: option E is 1800, which seems to fit. The other options are around 1875 or so, but that's higher. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't miscalculate.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: he needs a 20% profit on cost after the discount. So, his desired selling price is 120% of his cost. So, 1200 * 1.2 = 1440, same as before. Then, 1440 is 80% of the marked price. So, 1440 / 0.8 = 1800. Yep, same result.\n\nSo the correct option is E) 1,800.\n",

Hmm, right. So the question is about calculating the marked price, which is the price before discount, so that after giving 20% off, his selling price is still 20% higher than his cost.\n\nWait, let me think about profit. Profit is calculated on the cost price. So he wants a 20% profit on Rs. 1200. So first, I should calculate what 20% of 1200 is. \n\n20% of 1200 is (20/100)*1200 = 240. So his selling price needs to be 1200 + 240 = Rs. 1440. Because that's the amount he wants to get after the discount. \n\nBut wait, this selling price is after a 20% discount.

So the selling price should be 1200 + 240 = 1440. That's the amount he wants to get after the discount. \n\nBut wait, that selling price is after a 20% discount is applied. So the selling price is 80% of the marked price. Because if you give a 20% discount, you're left with 80% of the original price. \n\nSo, let me denote the marked price as M. Then, 80% of M equals the selling price. Which is 1440. So, 0.8 * M = 1440. \n\nTo find M, I can rearrange that. M = 1440 / 0.8. Let me calculate that. 1440 divided by 0.8. Hmm, 1440 divided by 8 is 180. So 1440 / 0.8 would be 1800? Because 0.8 is 8 tenths, so dividing by 0.8 is same as multiplying by 10/8. So 1440 * (10/8) = 1440 *1.25. Let me compute that: 1440 * 1 is 1440, 1440 *0.25 is 360, so total is 1800. \n\nWait, so the marked price should be Rs. 1800. Looking at the options, option E is 1800. But wait, wait a minute, let me double-check. \n\nBecause sometimes when I do these percentage problems, I might confuse the profit calculation. Let me confirm. \n\nCost price is 1200. He wants 20% profit, so selling price is 1200 *1.2 = 1440. \n\nThen, the selling price is after a 20% discount, meaning it's 80% of the marked price. So M * 0.8 = 1440. M = 1440 /0.8= 1800. Yes, that's correct. \n\nLooking at the options again: A is 1879, B is 1875, C is 1876, D is 1872, E is 1800. So the correct answer must be E. \n\nWait, but why are the other options so close? Like 1875 is option B. Did I make a mistake in calculation? Let me check again. \n\nWait, 1440 divided by 0.8: 1440 / 0.8. Let me do this division properly. 0.8 goes into 1440 how many times? 0.8 * 1800 is 1440, yes. Because 0.8 * 1000 is 800, 0.8 * 800 is 640. 800+800=1600, but 0.8*1800: 1800 *0.8= 1440. Correct. So M is 1800. So E is the answer. \n\nWait, but another way to think: sometimes when you have discounts and profit margins, the base for percentage matters. Let me make sure I didn't confuse cost with selling price. \n\nSo, the profit is calculated on the cost. So yes, 20% of 1200 is 240. So selling price is 1440. Then, that selling price is after a 20% discount, which is 80% of the marked price. So M is 1800. Yeah, that's correct. So the answer should be E.\n",

Then, 80% of M equals the selling price. Which is 1440. So, 0.8 * M = 1440. \n\nTo find M, I can rearrange that. M = 1440 / 0.8. Let me calculate that. 1440 divided by 0.8. Hmm, 1440 divided by 8 is 180. So 1440 / 0.8 would be 1800? Because 0.8 is 8 tenths, so dividing by 0.8 is same as multiplying by 10/8. So 1440 * (10/8) = 1440 *1.25. Let me compute that: 1440 * 1 is 1440, 1440 *0.25 is 360, so total is 1800. \n\nWait, so the marked price should be Rs. 1800. Looking at the options, option E is 1800. But wait, wait a minute, let me double-check. \n\nBecause sometimes when I do these percentage problems, I might confuse the profit calculation. Let me confirm. \n\nCost price is 1200. He wants 20% profit, so selling price is 1200 *1.2 = 1440. \n\nThen, the selling price is after a 20% discount, meaning it's 80% of the marked price. So M * 0.8 = 1440. M = 1440 /0.8= 1800. Yes, that's correct. \n\nLooking at the options again: A is 1879, B is 1875, C is 1876, D is 1872, E is 1800. So the correct answer must be E. \n\nWait, but why are the other options so close? Like 1875 is option B. Did I make a mistake in calculation? Let me check again. \n\nWait, 1440 divided by 0.8: 1440 / 0.8. Let me do this division properly. 0.8 goes into 1440 how many times? 0.8 * 1800 is 1440, yes. Because 0.8 * 1000 is 800, 0.8 * 800 is 640. 800+800=1600, but 0.8*1800: 1800 *0.8= 1440. Correct. So M is 1800. So E is the answer. \n\nWait, but another way to think: sometimes when you have discounts and profit margins, the base for percentage matters. Let me make sure I didn't confuse cost with selling price. \n\nSo, the profit is calculated on the cost. So yes, 20% of 1200 is 240. So selling price is 1440. Then, that selling price is after a 20% discount, which is 80% of the marked price. So M is 1800. Yeah, that's correct. So the answer should be E.\n\n\nTo determine the marked price Karan should set for the sewing machine, we start by calculating the desired selling price after a 20% discount. Karan wants a 20% profit on the cost price of Rs. 1200. \n\n1. **Calculate the desired selling price (SP):**  \n   Karan's cost is Rs. 1200, and he wants a 20% profit.  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit} = 20\\% \\text{ of } 1200 = 0.2 \\times 1200 = 240\n   \\]  \n   Therefore, the selling price should be:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{SP} = 1200 + 240 = 1440\n   \\]\n\n2. **Relate the selling price to the marked price (M):**  \n   The selling price is after a 20% discount, meaning it is 80% of the marked price.  \n   \\[\n   \\text{SP} = 0.8 \\times M\n   \\]  \n   Substituting the value of SP:  \n   \\[\n   1440 = 0.8 \\times M\n   \\]  \n   Solving for \\( M \\):  \n   \\[\n   M = \\frac{1440}{0.8} = 1800\n   \\]\n\nThus, the marked price should be Rs. 1800. Among the given options, the correct answer is **E) 1,800**.\n\nAnswer: E",

Hmm, I need to figure out what the marked price should be.\n\nLet me think about the concepts here. Profit percentage is based on the cost price, right? So if he wants a 20% profit, that's 20% of the cost. His cost is Rs. 1200. So 20% of 1200 is 240. So his selling price should be 1200 + 240 = Rs. 1440.\n\nWait, but he's offering a 20% discount on the marked price. So the selling price after discount is 80% of the marked price. Let me denote the marked price as M. Then, 80% of M should be equal to 1440. So, 0.8 * M = 1440.\n\nTo find M, I can rearrange that. M = 1440 / 0.8. Let me calculate that. 1440 divided by 0.8 is the same as 1440 multiplied by 1.25. Let me see, 1440 * 1.25. Hmm, 1440 * 1 is 1440, 1440 * 0.25 is 360, so adding them together gives 1440 + 360 = 1800. Oh wait, but wait a minute, that would make M Rs. 1800.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 1800. But wait, let me double-check. Because sometimes profit is calculated differently. So, if the marked price is M, after a 20% discount, the selling price is M * 0.8. The profit is selling price minus cost price. So the profit is (M *0.8 - 1200) and this profit should be 20% of the cost, which is 240.\n\nSo, M*0.8 - 1200 = 240 \u2192 M*0.8 = 1440 \u2192 M = 1440 / 0.8 = 1800. Yes, that seems right. So the marked price should be 1800, which is option E.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again, option B is 1875. Did I make a mistake? Oh wait, maybe I confused the profit percentage. Let me think again. No, the profit is based on cost. So 20% of 1200 is 240, so selling price is 1440. Then, 1440 is 80% of M. So M is 1800. So E is the answer. But wait, none of the other options are 1800 except E. So why is option B 1875? Did I do something wrong?\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me recalculate 1440 divided by 0.8. 0.8 is 4/5. So 1440 * 5/4. 1440 divided by 4 is 360, multiplied by 5 is 1800. Yeah, correct. So why is option B 1875? Did I misread the question?\n\nWait, perhaps the profit is calculated on the selling price, not the cost? No, profit percentage is always based on cost price. So that should be correct. So why is 1875 an option?\n\nWait another approach. Let's say Karan wants a 20% profit on his cost. His cost is 1200. So desired selling price is 1200 * 1.2 = 1440. Then, the discount is 20%, so selling price is 80% of M. So 0.8M = 1440 \u2192 M = 1800. So yes, E is the correct answer. So why is B 1875? Maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is worded differently. Maybe the 20% discount is on the selling price, but no, the way it's phrased is that he offers a 20% discount on the marked price.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this step by step.\n\n1. Cost price (CP) = 1200.\n\n2. Desired profit = 20% of CP \u2192 0.2 * 1200 = 240.\n\n3. So, selling price (SP) should be CP + profit = 1440.\n\n4. SP is after a 20% discount on M. So, SP = M - 20% of M \u2192 SP = 0.8*M.\n\n5. So, 0.8*M = 1440 \u2192 M = 1440 / 0.8 = 1800.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer should be E) 1800.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, E is 1800. So why is the correct answer not E? Hmm, but in the problem statement, the options are A)1,879; B)1,875; C)1,876; D)1,872; E)1,800.\n\nSo, E is 1800, which matches what I calculated. So why is the option B 1875? Did I miscalculate?\n\nWait, perhaps the profit is calculated on the selling price, but that's not the usual way. Let me try that approach. If profit is 20% on SP, then:\n\nProfit = 0.2 * SP \u2192 SP - CP = 0.2 * SP \u2192 CP = SP - 0.2 SP \u2192 CP = 0.8 SP \u2192 SP = CP / 0.8 \u2192 1200 / 0.8 = 1500.\n\nBut then, SP is 1500, which is after 20% discount. So M = 1500 / 0.8 = 1875, which is option B. Hmm, but that approach is incorrect because profit is always calculated on cost, not on selling price. So I think the first approach is correct. But then why is E an option and B is another?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that Karan wants 20% profit on the marked price? No, that doesn't make sense. Profit is always on cost.\n\nWait, maybe the 20% discount is on the cost? No, the discount is on the marked price.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me check the math again. 1440 divided by 0.8. Let me compute 1440 / 0.8.\n\nWell, 0.8 is 8/10, so 1440 * 10/8 = (1440 /8)*10. 1440 divided by 8 is 180. 180 *10 is 1800. So that's correct. So why is option B 1875? Maybe the problem is that the profit is 20% of the marked price, but that's not how profits work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I read the question wrong. Let me re-read it.\n\n\"so that even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit?\"\n\nSo, the discount is on the marked price, and the profit is 20% on cost. So my initial approach is correct, giving M=1800 (option E). So why is option B 1875?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated 1440 /0.8. Let me try another way: 0.8 times what is 1440?\n\nLet me compute 1440 /0.8:\n\n0.8 \u00d7 1800 = 1440. Yes, correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the profit margin. No, the profit is 20% on cost, so 240.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is worded as making a 20% profit on the selling price, which would change things. Let me try that.\n\nIf profit is 20% of SP, then:\n\nProfit = 0.2 SP \u2192 SP - CP = 0.2 SP \u2192 CP = 0.8 SP \u2192 SP = CP /0.8 = 1200 /0.8= 1500.\n\nThen, SP is 1500 = 0.8 M \u2192 M=1500 /0.8= 1875. Which is option B. But is that correct? No, because profit is calculated on cost, not selling price. So this approach would be wrong.\n\nSo the correct approach is to have profit as 20% of cost, leading to M=1800, which is option E.\n\nWait, but why is option B present? Maybe the problem is that the profit is 20% on the marked price. Let's try that.\n\nIf profit is 20% of M, then:\n\nProfit = 0.2 M \u2192 SP = M -0.2 M =0.8 M.\n\nBut then, profit is SP - CP = 0.8 M -1200 = 0.2 M \u2192 0.8 M -1200 =0.2 M \u2192 0.6 M = 1200 \u2192 M=2000. That's not one of the options. So that's not it.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the 20% discount is on cost. That would be unusual, but let me see.\n\nIf discount is 20% on cost, then discount amount is 240. So selling price would be 1200 -240=960. But then, profit is 960 -1200= negative, which doesn't make sense. So that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the discount is 20% on the cost, but that's not how discounts work. Discounts are on the selling price, not cost. So I think I'm on the right track.\n\nSo, to sum up, the correct marked price is 1800, which is option E.\n",

Cost price (CP) = 1200.\n\n2. Desired profit = 20% of CP \u2192 0.2 * 1200 = 240.\n\n3. So, selling price (SP) should be CP + profit = 1440.\n\n4. SP is after a 20% discount on M. So, SP = M - 20% of M \u2192 SP = 0.8*M.\n\n5. So, 0.8*M = 1440 \u2192 M = 1440 / 0.8 = 1800.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer should be E) 1800.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, E is 1800. So why is the correct answer not E? Hmm, but in the problem statement, the options are A)1,879; B)1,875; C)1,876; D)1,872; E)1,800.\n\nSo, E is 1800, which matches what I calculated. So why is the option B 1875? Did I miscalculate?\n\nWait, perhaps the profit is calculated on the selling price, but that's not the usual way. Let me try that approach. If profit is 20% on SP, then:\n\nProfit = 0.2 * SP \u2192 SP - CP = 0.2 * SP \u2192 CP = SP - 0.2 SP \u2192 CP = 0.8 SP \u2192 SP = CP / 0.8 \u2192 1200 / 0.8 = 1500.\n\nBut then, SP is 1500, which is after 20% discount. So M = 1500 / 0.8 = 1875, which is option B. Hmm, but that approach is incorrect because profit is always calculated on cost, not on selling price. So I think the first approach is correct. But then why is E an option and B is another?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that Karan wants 20% profit on the marked price? No, that doesn't make sense. Profit is always on cost.\n\nWait, maybe the 20% discount is on the cost? No, the discount is on the marked price.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me check the math again. 1440 divided by 0.8. Let me compute 1440 / 0.8.\n\nWell, 0.8 is 8/10, so 1440 * 10/8 = (1440 /8)*10. 1440 divided by 8 is 180. 180 *10 is 1800. So that's correct. So why is option B 1875? Maybe the problem is that the profit is 20% of the marked price, but that's not how profits work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I read the question wrong. Let me re-read it.\n\n\"so that even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit?\"\n\nSo, the discount is on the marked price, and the profit is 20% on cost. So my initial approach is correct, giving M=1800 (option E). So why is option B 1875?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated 1440 /0.8. Let me try another way: 0.8 times what is 1440?\n\nLet me compute 1440 /0.8:\n\n0.8 \u00d7 1800 = 1440. Yes, correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the profit margin. No, the profit is 20% on cost, so 240.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is worded as making a 20% profit on the selling price, which would change things. Let me try that.\n\nIf profit is 20% of SP, then:\n\nProfit = 0.2 SP \u2192 SP - CP = 0.2 SP \u2192 CP = 0.8 SP \u2192 SP = CP /0.8 = 1200 /0.8= 1500.\n\nThen, SP is 1500 = 0.8 M \u2192 M=1500 /0.8= 1875. Which is option B. But is that correct? No, because profit is calculated on cost, not selling price. So this approach would be wrong.\n\nSo the correct approach is to have profit as 20% of cost, leading to M=1800, which is option E.\n\nWait, but why is option B present? Maybe the problem is that the profit is 20% on the marked price. Let's try that.\n\nIf profit is 20% of M, then:\n\nProfit = 0.2 M \u2192 SP = M -0.2 M =0.8 M.\n\nBut then, profit is SP - CP = 0.8 M -1200 = 0.2 M \u2192 0.8 M -1200 =0.2 M \u2192 0.6 M = 1200 \u2192 M=2000. That's not one of the options. So that's not it.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the 20% discount is on cost. That would be unusual, but let me see.\n\nIf discount is 20% on cost, then discount amount is 240. So selling price would be 1200 -240=960. But then, profit is 960 -1200= negative, which doesn't make sense. So that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the discount is 20% on the cost, but that's not how discounts work. Discounts are on the selling price, not cost. So I think I'm on the right track.\n\nSo, to sum up, the correct marked price is 1800, which is option E.\n\n\nTo determine the marked price Karan should set for the sewing machine, we start by calculating the desired selling price (SP). Karan wants a 20% profit on the cost price (CP), which is Rs. 1200. The profit amount is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Profit} = 0.2 \\times \\text{CP} = 0.2 \\times 1200 = 240\n\\]\n\nThus, the selling price should be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{SP} = \\text{CP} + \\text{Profit} = 1200 + 240 = 1440\n\\]\n\nSince Karan offers a 20% discount on the marked price (M), the selling price after the discount is 80% of the marked price:\n\n\\[\n\\text{SP} = 0.8 \\times M\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the value of SP:\n\n\\[\n1440 = 0.8 \\times M\n\\]\n\nSolving for M:\n\n\\[\nM = \\frac{1440}{0.8} = 1800\n\\]\n\nThus, the marked price should be Rs. 1800. Among the given options, the correct answer is:\n\n**E) 1,800**\n\nThe other options, such as B) 1,875, do not align with the correct calculation based on the problem's conditions.\n\nAnswer: E",
