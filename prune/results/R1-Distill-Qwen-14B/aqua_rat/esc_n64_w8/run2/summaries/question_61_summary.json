      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to solve this problem. So, the question is about finding the total number of students in a class based on their interests in different games. Hmm, I remember that percentages and fractions are involved, and there's also a group of students who aren't interested in any games.\n\nLet me break down the information given:\n\n1. 8% are interested in Football.\n2. 4/5 are interested in Cricket. Wait, 4/5 is the same as 80%, right?\n3. 10% are interested in Basketball.\n4. The remaining 20 students don't like any games.\n\nSo, I need to find the total number of students, let's call it T. \n\nLet me think about how much of the class is accounted for by the interested students. So, adding up the percentages: Football is 8%, Cricket is 80%, Basketball is 10%. Let me add those together. 8 + 80 is 88, plus 10 makes 98%. Oh, that's interesting. So 98% are interested in at least one of the games, and the remaining 2% are the ones not interested. Wait, but the problem says 20 students aren't interested. So those 20 students make up 2% of the total.\n\nSo, if 2% equals 20 students, I can set up an equation. Let me write that down. 2% of T is 20. In math terms, that's 0.02 * T = 20. To find T, I can divide both sides by 0.02. So T = 20 / 0.02. Let me calculate that. 20 divided by 0.02 is the same as 20 multiplied by 50, which equals 1000. So T is 1000.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes when you have overlapping interests, the percentages might not add up correctly. But wait, the problem doesn't mention anything about overlaps. It just says the percentages of students interested in each sport. So I think it's safe to assume that each group is separate unless told otherwise. Or maybe the 8%, 80%, and 10% are exclusive? Hmm, but even if there's overlap, the problem states that 20 students are not interested in any, which would still make the total interested 98% as before. So I think my initial approach holds.\n\nSo with T being 1000, let me check the options. Option E is 1000. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, let me think again. Did I miss anything? Let's recalculate. 8% of 1000 is 80 students. 4/5 is 800 students. 10% is 100 students. Adding those: 80 + 800 is 880, plus 100 is 980. Then the remaining is 20, which adds up to 1000.

And the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. The question is, how many students are there in the class?\n\nHmm. So, I think I need to find the total number of students. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, let's denote the total number of students as T. So T is what we're trying to find.\n\nNow, the problem gives different percentages and fractions for each sport. Let's list them:\n\n- Football: 8% of T \u2192 0.08*T\n- Cricket: 4/5 of T \u2192 0.8*T (since 4/5 is 0.8)\n- Basketball: 10% of T \u2192 0.10*T\n- Not interested in any: 20 students.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Do these percentages and fractions add up to 100%? Let's check.\n\nAdding them up: 8% + 4/5 (which is 80%) +10% equals 98%. Oh, because 8 + 80 is 88, plus 10 is 98. So that leaves 2% unaccounted for. Oh, right, the 20 students are the remaining, which must be 2% of T. Because 100% -98% = 2%.\n\nSo, 2% of T equals 20 students. That makes sense.\n\nSo, mathematically, 2% of T is 20 \u2192 0.02*T =20. So to find T, we can solve for it.\n\nLet me write that equation:\n\n0.02 * T = 20\n\nSo, solving for T:\n\nT = 20 / 0.02\n\nHmm, 20 divided by 0.02. Let me calculate that. 0.02 is 2 hundredths, so 20 divided by 0.02 is the same as 20 * (100/2) \u2192 20 *50 = 1000. So T is 1000.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 1000.

So, the question is about finding the total number of students in a class based on their interests in different games. Hmm, I remember from my math classes that this probably involves setting up an equation with percentages and then solving for the total.\n\nAlright, let's break down the information given. The problem states:\n\n- 8% are interested in Football.\n- 4/5 are interested in Cricket.\n- 10% are interested in Basketball.\n- The remaining 20 students are not interested in any games.\n\nWait, wait. I need to find the total number of students. Let me denote the total number as 'T'. So, T is what we're trying to find.\n\nSo, the students can be divided into four groups based on their interests. The first three are percentages of T, and the last is 20 students. Let's think about how to represent each group.\n\nFootball: 8% of T is 0.08 * T students.\n\nCricket: 4/5 of T is (4/5)*T students.\n\nBasketball: 10% of T is 0.10 * T students.\n\nThe remaining students are 20. So, the sum of all these groups should add up to the total T.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Are these groups overlapping? Like, could some students be interested in more than one game? The problem doesn't specify, so I think we have to assume that each student is only interested in one of the games, or perhaps that the categories are exclusive. Hmm, but the problem doesn't say that. Oh, this is a bit confusing. Or maybe, perhaps, the 20 students are the ones not interested in any, so the others are in at least one. But if the groups are not mutually exclusive, then we can't just add them up. Hmm.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"interested in Football\", \"interested in Cricket\", etc. It doesn't specify whether they can be interested in multiple. So, perhaps the problem is assuming that each student is only counted once, or perhaps it's just adding all the percentages and the remaining 20. Hmm.\n\nWait, but if the question is asking for the total number of students, and the 20 are the ones not interested in any, then the sum of the students interested in Football, Cricket, Basketball, and the 20 should add up to T.\n\nSo, equation-wise: 0.08T + (4/5)T + 0.10T + 20 = T.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, let's convert 4/5 to a decimal. 4 divided by 5 is 0.8. So,\n\n0.08T + 0.8T + 0.10T + 20 = T.\n\nAdding the terms with T:\n\n0.08 + 0.8 is 0.88, plus 0.10 is 0.98. So 0.98T +20 = T.\n\nNow, subtract 0.98T from both sides:\n\n20 = T - 0.98T.\n\nWhich is 20 = 0.02T.\n\nThen, solving for T: T = 20 / 0.02.\n\n20 divided by 0.02 is the same as 20 * 50, because 1/0.02 is 50. So 20 *50= 1000.\n\nWait, so T is 1000 students? Let me check the options. Option E is 1000. So the answer should be E.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. Did I make a mistake in adding up the percentages? Let me double-check the math.\n\n0.08 + 0.8 is 0.88, adding 0.10 gives 0.98. So 0.98 of T are interested in at least one of the games, and 20 are not. So yes, 0.98T +20 = T.\n\nSo 20 = 0.02 T => T=1000. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, another way to approach: 8% + 4/5 + 10% is 8% + 80% +10% = 98%. So 98% are interested in at least one game, 2% are not. So the remaining 20 students represent 2% of the total.\n\nSo, 2% of T is 20. So 0.02*T =20 => T=20 / 0.02 =1000.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the total number of students is 1000, which is option E.\n",

So,\n\n0.08T + 0.8T + 0.10T + 20 = T.\n\nAdding the terms with T:\n\n0.08 + 0.8 is 0.88, plus 0.10 is 0.98. So 0.98T +20 = T.\n\nNow, subtract 0.98T from both sides:\n\n20 = T - 0.98T.\n\nWhich is 20 = 0.02T.\n\nThen, solving for T: T = 20 / 0.02.\n\n20 divided by 0.02 is the same as 20 * 50, because 1/0.02 is 50. So 20 *50= 1000.\n\nWait, so T is 1000 students? Let me check the options. Option E is 1000. So the answer should be E.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. Did I make a mistake in adding up the percentages? Let me double-check the math.\n\n0.08 + 0.8 is 0.88, adding 0.10 gives 0.98. So 0.98 of T are interested in at least one of the games, and 20 are not. So yes, 0.98T +20 = T.\n\nSo 20 = 0.02 T => T=1000. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, another way to approach: 8% + 4/5 + 10% is 8% + 80% +10% = 98%. So 98% are interested in at least one game, 2% are not. So the remaining 20 students represent 2% of the total.\n\nSo, 2% of T is 20. So 0.02*T =20 => T=20 / 0.02 =1000.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the total number of students is 1000, which is option E.\n\n\nTo determine the total number of students in the class, let \\( T \\) represent the total number of students. The problem provides the following information:\n\n- 8% of students are interested in Football: \\( 0.08T \\).\n- \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\) of students are interested in Cricket: \\( 0.8T \\).\n- 10% of students are interested in Basketball: \\( 0.10T \\).\n- The remaining 20 students are not interested in any games.\n\nThe sum of all these groups must equal the total number of students \\( T \\). Therefore, the equation is:\n\n\\[\n0.08T + 0.8T + 0.10T + 20 = T\n\\]\n\nCombine the terms involving \\( T \\):\n\n\\[\n0.08T + 0.8T + 0.10T = 0.98T\n\\]\n\nSubstituting back into the equation:\n\n\\[\n0.98T + 20 = T\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\( 0.98T \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n20 = T - 0.98T\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n20 = 0.02T\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\( T \\):\n\n\\[\nT = \\frac{20}{0.02} = 1000\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of students in the class is **1000**.\n\nAnswer: E",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and think through it step by step.\n\nThe problem says: In a class, 8% of the total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of the total students are interested in Cricket. 10% are interested in Basketball. The remaining 20 students aren't interested in any games. How many students are there in the class?\n\nHmm, I need to find the total number of students. Let's denote the total number of students as T. That might make it easier to handle the percentages and fractions.\n\nSo, breaking it down:\n\n- Football: 8% of T \u2192 0.08T\n- Cricket: 4/5 of T \u2192 since 4/5 is 0.8, that's 0.8T\n- Basketball: 10% of T \u2192 0.10T\n- Not interested in any: 20 students.\n\nWait a second, I think I should add up the percentages of students interested in each sport and then subtract that from the total to find out how many are left, which should equal the 20 students not interested in any. But wait, the way the problem is phrased, the remaining 20 are not interested in any of the games, so that implies that the sum of the interested students plus 20 equals the total.\n\nWait, no, actually, no. Let me think again. The total number of students is T. The ones not interested in any are 20. The rest are interested in at least one of the games. So, the sum of students interested in Football, Cricket, Basketball should equal T minus 20.\n\nBut wait, wait. Is that the case? Are these percentages overlapping? Because a student could be interested in more than one sport. The problem doesn't specify if these are exclusive or not. Hmm. Oh, but the question just says percentages of total students are interested in each sport. It doesn't say that they're mutually exclusive. So, for the purpose of this problem, perhaps we're supposed to assume that the interests are not overlapping, but I'm not sure. Wait, but the question is asking for the total number of students, and the way it's phrased, it's just adding up the percentages, which might not account for overlaps. Wait, but the problem states that the remaining 20 aren't interested in any, so the sum of the students interested in at least one sport is T - 20.\n\nSo, the sum of the percentages (plus any overlaps) would be T -20. But since the problem doesn't specify any overlaps, perhaps the problem is assuming that each student is only counted once for each sport they are interested in. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the total interested in any of the sports as the sum of each sport's percentage, but that would overcount if there's any overlap.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't provide information about overlaps. So perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by adding the percentages, subtracting from 100%, and then adding the 20. But that approach might not account for overlaps, which could make the answer incorrect. Hmm. Wait, but perhaps the problem is assuming that the sports interests are exclusive, which is unlikely, but maybe that's the approach intended here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is structured in such a way that the sum of the percentages plus the 20 equals the total. So, perhaps the 8%, 80%, 10%, and 20% make up 100% of the students, but that doesn't add up. Wait, let me calculate the sum of the percentages.\n\nWait, 8% for Football, 4/5 (which is 80%) for Cricket, 10% for Basketball. Let's add these up:\n\n8% + 80% + 10% = 98%. So that's 98% of the students interested in at least one sport, and the remaining 2% would be the 20 students not interested in any. But wait, 98% plus 2% is 100%, which makes sense. So, 2% of T equals 20 students.\n\nSo, 2% of T is 20 \u2192 0.02T = 20 \u2192 T = 20 / 0.02 \u2192 T = 1000.\n\nWait, but that would make the total 1000 students. Let me check the options. Option E is 1000. So, is that correct?\n\nBut wait, let's make sure. Because if 8% are interested in Football, 80% in Cricket, and 10% in Basketball, adding those up gives 98%, which would leave 2% not interested. So, 2% of T is 20 \u2192 T = 20 / 0.02 = 1000.\n\nBut wait, is this correct? Because the problem says that 4/5 are interested in Cricket, which is 80%\u2014so that's a much higher number. But if the total is 1000, then:\n\nFootball: 8% of 1000 = 80 students.\n\nCricket: 80% of 1000 = 800 students.\n\nBasketball: 10% of 1000 = 100 students.\n\nTotal interested in any sport: 80 + 800 + 100 = 980.\n\nThen, the remaining 20 students are not interested in any, which adds up to 1000.\n\nSo that seems to fit. But wait, in this scenario, the sum of the students interested in each sport is 980, but that's including overlaps. Because a student could be in both Football and Cricket, for example. But the problem doesn't give any information about overlaps, so perhaps the intended approach is to add the percentages and find that the sum is 98%, so the remaining 2% is 20, leading to 1000 total students.\n\nBut wait, another thought: if the 4/5 (80%) are interested in Cricket, and 8% in Football, and 10% in Basketball, perhaps these are separate. But that's probably not possible because 80% is a large portion.\n\nWait, but the problem is phrased as \"interested in Football\", \"interested in Cricket\", etc. So each is a separate category, but a student could be in more than one. But without knowing the overlaps, we can't accurately compute the total number. So perhaps the problem is designed such that the sum of the percentages plus the 20 equals the total.\n\nWait, but in that case, 8% + 80% + 10% = 98%. So 98% of T are interested in at least one sport, and 2% are not, which is 20 students. So 2% = 20 \u2192 T = 1000.\n\nSo the answer would be E) 1000.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options, E is 1000. So I think that's the correct answer.\n",

If the total is 1000 students, then:\n\nFootball: 8% of 1000 is 80 students.\nCricket: 4/5 is 800 students.\nBasketball: 10% is 100 students.\nUninterested: 20 students.\n\nWait, but if I add up the interested students: 80 + 800 + 100 = 980. Plus the 20 uninterested, that's 1000. So that makes sense.\n\nSo the answer should be E) 1000.\n\n\nTo determine the total number of students in the class, we start by analyzing the given data:\n\n1. **Percentages of students interested in sports:**\n   - Football: 8%\n   - Cricket: \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\) of the total, which is equivalent to 80%.\n   - Basketball: 10%.\n\n2. **Remaining students not interested in any sports:**\n   - 20 students.\n\n3. **Total percentage of students interested in at least one sport:**\n   \\[\n   8\\% + 80\\% + 10\\% = 98\\%.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Percentage of students not interested in any sports:**\n   \\[\n   100\\% - 98\\% = 2\\%.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Relating the uninterested students to the total:**\n   - 2% of the total students equals 20 students.\n   - Let \\( N \\) be the total number of students. Then:\n     \\[\n     2\\% \\times N = 20 \\implies 0.02N = 20 \\implies N = \\frac{20}{0.02} = 1000.\n     \\]\n\n6. **Verification:**\n   - Total students: 1000.\n   - Football: \\( 8\\% \\times 1000 = 80 \\).\n   - Cricket: \\( 80\\% \\times 1000 = 800 \\).\n   - Basketball: \\( 10\\% \\times 1000 = 100 \\).\n   - Uninterested: 20.\n   - Total: \\( 80 + 800 + 100 + 20 = 1000 \\), which matches the total number of students.\n\nThus, the total number of students in the class is **1000**.\n\nAnswer: E",

So, the question is about finding the total number of students in a class based on their interests in different sports and the number not interested in any. Hmm, I'll need to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's read the problem again. We're told that 8% of the total students are interested in Football. Then, 4/5 of the students are interested in Cricket. 10% are into Basketball. And the remaining 20 students don't like any games. We need to find the total number of students.\n\nWait, so the students interested in each sport are given as percentages or fractions, and then the leftovers are 20 students.

Oh, the question doesn't specify anything about overlaps, so I think we can assume that these percentages are separate, or that the interest categories are mutually exclusive.

Hmm, but wait, 8% + 4/5 + 10%\u2014let me calculate that.\n\nWait, 4/5 is 0.8, which is 80%. So adding up the percentages: 8% (Football) + 80% (Cricket) + 10% (Basketball) equals 98%. Oh, right, because 8 + 80 is 88, plus 10 is 98. So that leaves 2% of the students uninterested, but the problem says 20 students are uninterested. So 2% equals 20 students. That makes sense. So if 2% of the total is 20, then the total number of students is 20 divided by 0.02.\n\nLet me calculate that. 20 divided by 0.02 is 1000. So the total number of students is 1000. Wait, but let me double-check. If 2% is 20, then 1% is 10, so 100% is 1000. Yes, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Are the percentages adding up correctly?

So, the question is about finding the total number of students in a class based on their interests in different games and some given percentages. Hmm, percentages can sometimes be tricky, but I think I can handle it step by step.\n\nAlright, let's break down the information given. First, 8% of the total students are interested in Football. Then, 4/5 of the total students are interested in Cricket. Next, 10% are into Basketball. And the rest, which is 20 students, aren't interested in any of these games. The task is to find out how many students are in the class.\n\nSo, I think I should represent the total number of students with a variable. Let's call it 'T' for total. That way, I can work with it more easily.\n\nNow, let's list out the percentages and fractions in terms of T:\n\n- Football: 8% of T \u2192 0.08T\n- Cricket: 4/5 of T \u2192 since 4/5 is 0.8, that's 0.8T\n- Basketball: 10% of T \u2192 0.10T\n- Not interested in any: 20 students.\n\nWait, but adding all these up should give me the total number of students, right? Because every student is either interested in one of the games or none. So, the sum of all the interested students plus the uninterested ones equals T.\n\nSo, the equation should be:\n\n0.08T + 0.8T + 0.10T + 20 = T\n\nLet me calculate the sum of the percentages first. Let's add them up.\n\n0.08T + 0.8T is 0.88T, and adding 0.10T gives 0.98T. So, 0.98T +20 = T.\n\nHmm, now I can rearrange this equation to solve for T. Let's subtract 0.98T from both sides to get the terms involving T on one side.\n\n0.98T +20 = T  \n20 = T - 0.98T  \n20 = 0.02T\n\nOh, right, because 1 - 0.98 is 0.02. So, 0.02T equals 20. To find T, I divide both sides by 0.02.\n\nT = 20 / 0.02  \nWhat's 20 divided by 0.02? Let me think. 0.02 is 2 hundredths, so 20 divided by 0.02 is the same as 20 multiplied by 50, because 1/0.02 is 50. So 20 * 50 = 1000.\n\nWait, so T is 1000? Let me check the options. Option E is 1000. Hmm, but I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me verify each part again. 8% is 0.08, 4/5 is 0.8, and 10% is 0.10. Adding 0.08 + 0.8 + 0.10 gives 0.98, right? So 0.98T plus 20 equals T. Subtracting 0.98T, 20 = 0.02T. So T is 20 divided by 0.02, which is 1000. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me think about the percentages again. Maybe I should consider if the percentages overlap. Oh, wait, the problem doesn't specify whether these are exclusive interests or if students can be interested in more than one game. Oh, the problem says \"interested in Football,\" \"interested in Cricket,\" etc. So, they might be overlapping. But the question is only asking for the total number of students, not the number interested in each game. So maybe the overlapping doesn't matter here because we're only considering the sum of all students, regardless of overlaps. So, the initial approach should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that these are all exclusive, but I think the way the question is phrased, each percentage is a separate group. So, adding them up is the right approach.\n\nSo, with that, T is 1000. Looking at the options, E is 1000. So the answer should be E.\n",

Let's read the question again carefully.\n\nThe problem says that 8% of the total students are interested in Football. Then, 4/5 of the total students are interested in Cricket. Oh wait, and 10% are interested in Basketball. The rest, which is 20 students, are not interested in any games. I need to find out how many students are there in total.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. So, the students can be divided into four groups based on their interests: Football, Cricket, Basketball, and none of them. The sum of all these groups should equal the total number of students.\n\nLet me denote the total number of students as N. That makes sense. So, N is what we're trying to find.\n\nNow, let's write down each group in terms of N.\n\n1. Football: 8% of N \u2192 0.08N\n2. Cricket: 4/5 of N \u2192 (4/5)N. Wait, 4/5 is 0.8, so that's 0.8N.\n3. Basketball: 10% of N \u2192 0.10N\n4. None: 20 students.\n\nSo, adding all these up should give us N.\n\nThe equation would be:\n\n0.08N + 0.8N + 0.10N + 20 = N\n\nWait, let me check that. Yes, because each part adds up to the total. So when we add all the interested students and the uninterested ones, it should equal the total.\n\nLet me compute the sum of the interested students first.\n\n0.08N + 0.8N is 0.88N, plus 0.10N gives 0.98N. Oh, so the interested students add up to 0.98N.\n\nThen, the remaining 20 students are not interested. So, the equation is:\n\n0.98N + 20 = N\n\nHmm, solving for N. Let me rearrange this equation.\n\nSubtract 0.98N from both sides:\n\n20 = N - 0.98N \u2192 20 = 0.02N\n\nOh right, because N is 1N, so 1N - 0.98N is 0.02N.\n\nSo, 0.02N = 20 \u2192 N = 20 / 0.02 \u2192 Let me calculate that.\n\n20 divided by 0.02 is the same as 20 * (1/0.02) \u2192 1/0.02 is 50, so 20 *50 = 1000.\n\nWait, so N is 1000 students? That seems straightforward.\n\nLet me cross-check the numbers to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nIf N is 1000:\n\nFootball: 8% of 1000 = 80 students.\nCricket: 4/5 of 1000 = 800 students.\nBasketball: 10% of 1000 = 100 students.\nTotal interested: 80 + 800 + 100 = 980 students.\nUninterested: 1000 - 980 = 20 students.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the total number of students in the class. Let's read the question again carefully.\n\nThe problem says that 8% of the total students are interested in Football. Then, 4/5 of the total students are interested in Cricket. Oh wait, and 10% are interested in Basketball. The rest, which is 20 students, are not interested in any games. I need to find out how many students are there in total.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. So, the students can be divided into four groups based on their interests: Football, Cricket, Basketball, and none of them. The sum of all these groups should equal the total number of students.\n\nLet me denote the total number of students as N. That makes sense. So, N is what we're trying to find.\n\nNow, let's write down each group in terms of N.\n\n1. Football: 8% of N \u2192 0.08N\n2. Cricket: 4/5 of N \u2192 (4/5)N. Wait, 4/5 is 0.8, so that's 0.8N.\n3. Basketball: 10% of N \u2192 0.10N\n4. None: 20 students.\n\nSo, adding all these up should give us N.\n\nThe equation would be:\n\n0.08N + 0.8N + 0.10N + 20 = N\n\nWait, let me check that. Yes, because each part adds up to the total. So when we add all the interested students and the uninterested ones, it should equal the total.\n\nLet me compute the sum of the interested students first.\n\n0.08N + 0.8N is 0.88N, plus 0.10N gives 0.98N. Oh, so the interested students add up to 0.98N.\n\nThen, the remaining 20 students are not interested. So, the equation is:\n\n0.98N + 20 = N\n\nHmm, solving for N. Let me rearrange this equation.\n\nSubtract 0.98N from both sides:\n\n20 = N - 0.98N \u2192 20 = 0.02N\n\nOh right, because N is 1N, so 1N - 0.98N is 0.02N.\n\nSo, 0.02N = 20 \u2192 N = 20 / 0.02 \u2192 Let me calculate that.\n\n20 divided by 0.02 is the same as 20 * (1/0.02) \u2192 1/0.02 is 50, so 20 *50 = 1000.\n\nWait, so N is 1000 students? That seems straightforward.\n\nLet me cross-check the numbers to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nIf N is 1000:\n\nFootball: 8% of 1000 = 80 students.\nCricket: 4/5 of 1000 = 800 students.\nBasketball: 10% of 1000 = 100 students.\nTotal interested: 80 + 800 + 100 = 980 students.\nUninterested: 1000 - 980 = 20 students. Which matches the given information.\n\nSo yes, that all adds up correctly. Therefore, the total number of students is 1000.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 1000.
