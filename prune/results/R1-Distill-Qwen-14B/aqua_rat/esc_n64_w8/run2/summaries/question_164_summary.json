      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about making identical bouquets with white and red tulips. Let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nThe problem says we have 28 white tulips and 98 red tulips. We need to make the greatest number of identical bouquets without leaving any flowers out. Identical bouquets mean each one has the same number of white and red tulips. So, every bouquet must have the same count for both colors.\n\nHmm, I think this has to do with finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers. Because the GCD would be the largest number that can divide both 28 and 98 exactly, which would tell me the maximum number of bouquets I can make.\n\nWait, let me make sure. So, each bouquet will have 28 divided by the GCD number of white tulips and 98 divided by the same GCD number of red tulips. Since the GCD is the largest possible, that should give the maximum number of bouquets without leftovers.\n\nSo, first, I need to calculate the GCD of 28 and 98. Let's break it down.\n\nThe factors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28.\nThe factors of 98 are 1, 2, 7, 14, 49, 98.\n\nLooking for the common factors, I see 1, 2, 7, 14. The largest one is 14. So the GCD is 14.\n\nWait, wait a second. If the GCD is 14, that would mean each bouquet has 28/14 = 2 white tulips and 98/14 = 7 red tulips. So each bouquet has 2 white and 7 red. Then, the number of bouquets would be 14. But wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, 28 divided by 14 is 2, which is correct. 98 divided by 14 is 7. So each bouquet uses 2 white and 7 red. So 14 bouquets would use all 28 white (14 * 2 =28) and 14*7=98 red. That adds up. So that works.\n\nBut wait, the options given are A)4, B)7, C)10, D)14, E)21. So 14 is option D. But wait, wait, another way to think: maybe the maximum number of bouquets is determined by the minimum of the two divided by something else?\n\nWait no, because each bouquet uses both colors. So the maximum number is the GCD. So if the GCD is 14, then 14 bouquets can be made. So the answer should be D)14.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Suppose the GCD is 14, but can we have more bouquets if we don't split the numbers that way? No, because if we tried a higher number than 14, like 21, which is option E, but 21 doesn't divide 28 evenly. 28 divided by 21 is about 1.333, which isn't an integer. So that's not possible. Similarly, 10 doesn't divide 28 evenly. 28 /10 is 2.8, which isn't a whole number.\n\nSo the next option is 7, which is option B. Wait, 7 is a factor of both 28 and 98. Let's see: 28/7=4, and 98/7=14. So each bouquet would have 4 white and 14 red. Then 7 bouquets would use all the flowers. But wait, that's fewer bouquets than the 14 we calculated earlier. So 14 is better because it's a higher number.\n\nSo why is 14 an option? Because 14 bouquets each with 2 white and 7 red would use all the flowers. So 14 is the correct answer, which is option D.\n\nWait, another way: the number of bouquets must divide both 28 and 98. So the possible numbers are the common divisors. The largest is 14. So that's the maximum number of bouquets.\n",

Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: What's the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made from 28 white and 98 red tulips, with none left out. And two bouquets are identical if they have the same number of red and white tulips each.\n\nHmm. So I need to figure out how many bouquets I can make, each having the same number of white and red tulips, using all of them. Oh right, no flowers can be left, so all 28 white and 98 red must be used.\n\nI think the key here is to find a common divisor for both the number of white and red tulips. Because each bouquet will have a certain number of white and red, and to make them identical, the number in each should be such that when multiplied by the number of bouquets, it adds up exactly to 28 white and 98 red.\n\nWait, so like, if I have 'b' bouquets, then each bouquet has w white and r red tulips. So:\n\nw * b = 28\nr * b = 98\n\nSo I need to find the largest possible 'b' that divides both 28 and 98 exactly. That means 'b' must be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 28 and 98.\n\nWait, is that right? Because if 'b' is the number of bouquets, then each bouquet will have 28/b white and 98/b red tulips. But 28/b and 98/b have to be integers because you can't have a fraction of a tulip in a bouquet.\n\nSo yeah, 'b' has to be a common divisor of 28 and 98. The greatest such 'b' is the GCD of 28 and 98.\n\nSo let me calculate GCD(28,98). Let's see, 28 factors are 1,2,4,7,14,28. 98 is 2*49, which is 2*7^2. So the factors of 98 are 1,2,7,14,49,98.\n\nThe common factors are 1,2,7,14. So the greatest is 14. So the maximum number of bouquets is 14.\n\nWait, but let me check. If b is 14, then each bouquet would have 28/14 = 2 white tulips, and 98/14 =7 red. That works, because 2 and 7 are integers.\n\nAlternatively, if I took a smaller number, like 7 bouquets, each would have 4 white (28/7=4) and 14 red (98/7=14). That also works, but 14 is higher, so 14 is better.\n\nWait, but why not 28? Because 98 divided by 28 is 3.5, which is not an integer. So 28 isn't a divisor of 98.

So, the GCD of 28 and 98 should give me the maximum number of bouquets possible.\n\nLet me calculate the GCD of 28 and 98. Let's see, 28 factors are 1,2,4,7,14,28. And 98's factors are 1,2,7,14,49,98. The common factors are 1,2,7,14. So the greatest is 14. Oh wait, but wait a minute. Wait, 28 divided by 14 is 2, and 98 divided by 14 is 7. So each bouquet would have 2 white and 7 red tulips. That seems correct because 14 bouquets each with 2 white would use all 28, and each with 7 red would use all 98.\n\nBut wait, the options given are A)4, B)7, C)10, D)14, E)21. So 14 is option D. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check. Because 14 bouquets would require 28 white and 98 red, which exactly matches the numbers given. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but another approach: the number of bouquets has to be a divisor of both 28 and 98. So the maximum possible is indeed their GCD, which is 14. So the answer should be D)14.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes people might think it's the sum, but no, in this case, it's about each bouquet having the same composition, so it's the GCD of the two numbers.\n\nSo the answer is D)14.\n",

Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nSo the problem says we have 28 white tulips and 98 red ones. And we need to make as many identical bouquets as possible without leaving any flowers. Oh right, identical means each bouquet has the same number of white and red tulips.\n\nHmm, I remember that when you need to divide things into equal groups without leftovers, you should look for the greatest common divisor, or GCD. Because the GCD is the largest number that can divide both quantities evenly. \n\nWait, let me think. So each bouquet will have a certain number of white tulips and a certain number of red ones. Since they're identical, each bouquet must take the same number of each type. So the number of bouquets will be the same as the number of times we can take those numbers from the total.\n\nSo, for example, if each bouquet has x white and y red tulips, then the total white used will be x multiplied by the number of bouquets (let's say n), and similarly for red. So:\n\nx * n = 28 (white)\ny * n = 98 (red)\n\nAnd since we can't have any leftovers, n must be a number that divides both 28 and 98 exactly. So n is the GCD of 28 and 98.\n\nWait, but what's the GCD of 28 and 98? Let me calculate that. \n\nBreaking them down into prime factors:\n- 28 factors: 2 * 2 * 7, or 2\u00b2 * 7\u00b9.\n- 98 factors: 2 * 49, which is 2 * 7\u00b2.\n\nThe GCD is the product of the lowest powers of common primes. So common primes are 2 and 7.\n\nSo for 2: the lowest exponent is 1 (since 28 has 2\u00b2, 98 has 2\u00b9)\nFor 7: the lowest exponent is 1 (28 has 7\u00b9, 98 has 7\u00b2)\nSo GCD is 2^1 * 7^1 = 14.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 14 bouquets would require 14 * x white and 14 * y red.\n\nWait, let me check again. If n is 14, then x would be 28/14=2, and y would be 98/14=7. So each bouquet would have 2 white and 7 red tulips. That adds up to 9 tulips per bouquet, but the question is just about the number of bouquets, not the composition.\n\nBut wait, the options include 14 as an option D. So why isn't 14 the correct answer? Because 14 bouquets would use all the flowers, right?\n\nWait, but wait, the question says \"the greatest number of identical bouquets\". So if 14 is possible, why would the answer be less?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the GCD calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 28 and 98. Let's see:\n\nDividing 98 by 28: 98 \u00f728 is 3.5. So 28 doesn't divide 98 exactly. Wait, wait no, 28*3=84, 28*3.5=98. But 3.5 is not an integer. So 28 can't be a divisor of 98. Hmm, maybe I did the GCD wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the Euclidean algorithm. So GCD(98,28):\n\n98 divided by 28 is 3, remainder 14 (since 28*3=84, 98-84=14)\nNow GCD(28,14). 28 divided by 14 is 2, remainder 0. So GCD is 14.\n\nOh, right, so 14 is the GCD. So n=14 is the maximum number of bouquets.\n\nWait, but wait, 14 bouquets would require 14 x (2 white and 7 red) = 28 white and 98 red. That's exactly what we have. So why is 14 an option, and the correct answer would be 14? But the options include D)14.\n\nWait, but the problem is phrased as 'identical bouquets' where each bouquet has the same number of white and red. So 14 bouquets each with 2 white and 7 red is possible.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about making identical bouquets with white and red tulips. Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nSo the problem says we have 28 white tulips and 98 red ones. And we need to make as many identical bouquets as possible without leaving any flowers. Oh right, identical means each bouquet has the same number of white and red tulips.\n\nHmm, I remember that when you need to divide things into equal groups without leftovers, you should look for the greatest common divisor, or GCD. Because the GCD is the largest number that can divide both quantities evenly. \n\nWait, let me think. So each bouquet will have a certain number of white tulips and a certain number of red ones. Since they're identical, each bouquet must take the same number of each type. So the number of bouquets will be the same as the number of times we can take those numbers from the total.\n\nSo, for example, if each bouquet has x white and y red tulips, then the total white used will be x multiplied by the number of bouquets (let's say n), and similarly for red. So:\n\nx * n = 28 (white)\ny * n = 98 (red)\n\nAnd since we can't have any leftovers, n must be a number that divides both 28 and 98 exactly. So n is the GCD of 28 and 98.\n\nWait, but what's the GCD of 28 and 98? Let me calculate that. \n\nBreaking them down into prime factors:\n- 28 factors: 2 * 2 * 7, or 2\u00b2 * 7\u00b9.\n- 98 factors: 2 * 49, which is 2 * 7\u00b2.\n\nThe GCD is the product of the lowest powers of common primes. So common primes are 2 and 7.\n\nSo for 2: the lowest exponent is 1 (since 28 has 2\u00b2, 98 has 2\u00b9)\nFor 7: the lowest exponent is 1 (28 has 7\u00b9, 98 has 7\u00b2)\nSo GCD is 2^1 * 7^1 = 14.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 14 bouquets would require 14 * x white and 14 * y red.\n\nWait, let me check again. If n is 14, then x would be 28/14=2, and y would be 98/14=7. So each bouquet would have 2 white and 7 red tulips. That adds up to 9 tulips per bouquet, but the question is just about the number of bouquets, not the composition.\n\nBut wait, the options include 14 as an option D. So why isn't 14 the correct answer? Because 14 bouquets would use all the flowers, right?\n\nWait, but wait, the question says \"the greatest number of identical bouquets\". So if 14 is possible, why would the answer be less?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the GCD calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 28 and 98. Let's see:\n\nDividing 98 by 28: 98 \u00f728 is 3.5. So 28 doesn't divide 98 exactly. Wait, wait no, 28*3=84, 28*3.5=98. But 3.5 is not an integer. So 28 can't be a divisor of 98. Hmm, maybe I did the GCD wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the Euclidean algorithm. So GCD(98,28):\n\n98 divided by 28 is 3, remainder 14 (since 28*3=84, 98-84=14)\nNow GCD(28,14). 28 divided by 14 is 2, remainder 0. So GCD is 14.\n\nOh, right, so 14 is the GCD. So n=14 is the maximum number of bouquets.\n\nWait, but wait, 14 bouquets would require 14 x (2 white and 7 red) = 28 white and 98 red. That's exactly what we have. So why is 14 an option, and the correct answer would be 14? But the options include D)14.\n\nWait, but the problem is phrased as 'identical bouquets' where each bouquet has the same number of white and red. So 14 bouquets each with 2 white and 7 red is possible. So the maximum number is 14, so answer D.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the options, 14 is an option, but the answer seems to be 14. So why isn't it 14? Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. Another approach: the number of bouquets must divide both 28 and 98. So the maximum possible is the GCD, which is 14.\n\nBut wait, wait, 28 and 98. Let's think: 28 can be divided into 1,2,4,7,14,28. 98 can be divided into 1,2,7,14,49,98. The common divisors are 1,2,7,14. So the greatest is 14. So yes, 14 is the maximum number.\n\nSo the correct answer is D)14.\n\n\nTo determine the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made using 28 white and 98 red tulips without leaving any flowers unused, we need to find the largest number of bouquets, \\( n \\), such that each bouquet has the same number of white and red tulips.
