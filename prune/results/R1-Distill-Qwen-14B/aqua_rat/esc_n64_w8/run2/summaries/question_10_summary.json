      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a salesperson's commission. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question says that the salesperson gets a 10% commission on each sale. I need to find out how many sales of $250 each they must make to reach a salary of at least $1000. The options are A)15, B)24, C)25, D)40, E)52.\n\nHmm, let me think about this. So the salesperson's earnings come only from the commission, right? Because the question doesn't mention any base salary, just the commission. So each time they make a sale, they get 10% of that sale amount.\n\nEach sale is $250. So the commission per sale is 10% of 250. Let me calculate that. 10% is the same as 0.1, so 250 * 0.1 equals... let me do that math. 250 times 0.1 is 25. So each sale gives them $25 in commission.\n\nNow, the total salary they want is at least $1000. So I need to find how many sales (let's call it 'n') are needed so that 25 * n is >= 1000.\n\nSo the equation is 25n >= 1000. To find 'n', I'll divide both sides by 25. So n >= 1000 / 25. Let me compute that. 1000 divided by 25 is 40. So n has to be at least 40.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check the options. Option D is 40, so that seems to be the answer. But wait, sometimes in such problems, you have to consider if it's exactly 10% or if there's any rounding involved, but in this case, 25 times 40 is exactly 1000. So the minimum number of sales needed is 40.\n\nSo looking back at the options: D is 40. So the answer must be D.\n",

The question says: A salesperson gets a 10% commission on each sale he makes. How many sales of $250 each must he make in order to reach a salary of at least $1000? The options are A)15, B)24, C)25, D)40, E)52.\n\nHmm, right. So the salesperson earns 10% for each sale. Each sale is $250. He wants his salary to be at least $1000. So I need to find the minimum number of sales he needs to make to reach that.\n\nLet me break it down. First, what's the commission per sale? 10% of $250. So 10% is 0.10, and 0.10 multiplied by 250. Let me calculate that. 0.10 * 250 equals 25. So each sale gives him $25.\n\nNow, he wants his total commission to be at least $1000. So I need to find how many $25 commissions will add up to $1000. Let me think. If each sale is $25, then the number of sales n multiplied by 25 should be >= 1000.\n\nSo the equation is 25 * n >= 1000. To find n, I'll divide both sides by 25. So n >= 1000 / 25. Let me do that division. 1000 divided by 25 is 40. So n must be at least 40.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So each sale is $250, 10% is $25. So 40 sales would give 40 * 25 = 1000. Exactly 1000. So if the question is \"at least\" $1000, then 40 sales would be the minimum number. Because 39 sales would give 39 *25=975, which is less than 1000. So 40 is the correct number.\n\nLooking back at the options, D is 40. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I should consider if there's any possibility that the commission is calculated differently, like if it's on total sales or something else. But no, the problem states it's a 10% commission on each sale, so each individual sale is $250, so 10% of that is $25 per sale. So yeah, the calculation seems correct.\n",
