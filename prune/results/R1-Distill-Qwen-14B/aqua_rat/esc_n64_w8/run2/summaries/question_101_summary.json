      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about red and green sweets in a bag. The ratio of red to green is 3:4, and there are 120 green sweets. I need to find out how many red sweets there are. Hmm, ratios can sometimes trip me up, but I think I can handle this.\n\nAlright, ratios compare quantities. So, the ratio 3:4 means for every 3 red sweets, there are 4 green ones. So, if I think of it as parts, red is 3 parts and green is 4 parts. The total number of parts would be 3 + 4 = 7 parts. Wait, no, wait\u2014no, wait. Wait, no, the total parts aren't necessary here because I know the actual number of green sweets.\n\nLet me approach this step by step. The ratio red:green is 3:4. So, for every 3 red, there are 4 green. But I have 120 green. So, I can set up a proportion to find out how many reds correspond to 120 greens.\n\nLet me denote the number of red sweets as R. So according to the ratio, R/120 = 3/4. Because red over green equals 3 over 4. So, solving for R would be R = (3/4)*120. Let me compute that. 120 divided by 4 is 30, and 30 multiplied by 3 is 90. So R is 90. Wait, so the number of red sweets is 90.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 90. So that should be the correct answer. But let me double-check. If red is 3 parts and green is 4 parts, then each part must be equal. So, 4 parts correspond to 120. So, one part is 120 /4 = 30. Then, red is 3 parts, which would be 3 *30=90. Yep, same result. So I'm confident that A is the right choice.\n",

Let me think about how ratios work. Ratios can be expressed as fractions or with a colon. So 3:4 is the same as 3/4.\n\nLet me set this up. The ratio of red to green is 3:4. Let me denote the number of red sweets as R and green as G. So, R/G = 3/4. We know G is 120, so R/120 = 3/4.\n\nTo solve for R, I can cross-multiply. So 3 * 120 = 4 * R.

Wait no, because the ratio is red:green = 3:4, which means that for each green sweet, the red is 3/4 as much? No, wait, wait, that's not right. Because if there are 4 green, there are 3 red. So the number of red sweets is (3/4) times the number of green sweets. Because 3 is to 4 as R is to 120.\n\nWait, so R = (3/4)*G. And since G is 120, R = (3/4)*120.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it says. The question is about the ratio of red sweets to green sweets in a bag. The ratio given is 3:4. And they tell me there are 120 green sweets. I need to find out how many red sweets there are. The options are A)90, B)80, C)95, D)100, E)85.\n\nHmm, ratios can sometimes trip me up, but I think I remember how they work. A ratio compares two quantities. So here, red to green is 3:4. That means for every 3 red sweets, there are 4 green ones. \n\nWait, so if I think about it, the ratio can also be expressed as fractions. Like, red over green is 3/4. Or maybe 3 parts red to 4 parts green. Right, so the total number of parts would be 3+4=7 parts. But wait, do I need the total parts here? Or is there a simpler way?\n\nThey told me the number of green sweets is 120. Since the ratio is 3:4, the number of green sweets corresponds to the '4' part of the ratio. So if 4 parts equal 120, then each part must be 120 divided by 4. Let me calculate that: 120 \u00f74 is 30. So each part is 30 sweets.\n\nNow, since the red sweets are 3 parts, I can multiply the value of one part by 3. So 30 times 3 equals 90. So there should be 90 red sweets. Let me check the options. Option A is 90. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, did I do that right? Let me double-check. The ratio is 3:4, so 3 red to 4 green. 4 green equals 120, so each unit is 30. Red is 3 units, so 3*30=90. Yep, that seems correct. So the answer should be A)90.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe ratio of red to green sweets is 3:4, meaning for every 3 red sweets, there are 4 green sweets. Since there are 120 green sweets, we can determine the value of one part of the ratio by dividing 120 by 4, which equals 30. Each part of the ratio represents 30 sweets.
