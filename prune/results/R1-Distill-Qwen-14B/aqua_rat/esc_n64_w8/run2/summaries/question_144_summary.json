      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe problem states that events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6. Also, the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. I need to find the probability that event B occurs.\n\nHmm, I remember that when two events are independent, the probability of both occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. So P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). Since A and B are independent, that should come into play here.\n\nThe key part of the question is the probability that at least one of A or B occurs, which is given as 0.96. I think the formula for the probability of at least one of two events happening is P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Oh right, that's the inclusion-exclusion principle. So I can set up the equation using that.\n\nLet me write down the known values:\n- P(A) = 0.6\n- P(A or B) = 0.96\n\nSince A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.6 * P(B). Let me denote P(B) as 'p' for simplicity. So P(A and B) = 0.6p.\n\nNow, plug these into the inclusion-exclusion formula:\nP(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)\n0.96 = 0.6 + p - 0.6p\n\nWait, let me make sure I substitute correctly. So substituting:\n0.96 = 0.6 + p - (0.6 * p)\n\nSimplify the right side. Let's see, 0.6 plus p minus 0.6p. Combining like terms, p - 0.6p is 0.4p. So:\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4p\n\nNow I can solve for p. Subtract 0.6 from both sides:\n\n0.96 - 0.6 = 0.4p\n0.36 = 0.4p\n\nHmm, to find p, divide both sides by 0.4:\n\np = 0.36 / 0.4\nLet me calculate that. 0.36 divided by 0.4. Well, 0.4 times 0.9 is 0.36. So p = 0.9?\n\nWait, that would mean P(B) is 0.9. But let me double-check my steps because 0.9 seems a bit high, but maybe that's correct.\n\nWait another thought: Let me go through the steps again.\n\nWe have P(A or B) = 0.96.\n\nP(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B) because they're independent.\n\nSo 0.96 = 0.6 + p - (0.6 * p)\n\nWhich is 0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4p.\n\nSubtracting 0.6 gives 0.36 = 0.4p.\n\nDivide both sides by 0.4: p = 0.36 / 0.4 = 0.9.\n\nSo yes, p is 0.9. Looking at the options, option E is 0.9. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If P(B) is 0.9, then the probability that at least one occurs would be 0.6 + 0.9 - (0.6*0.9) = 1.5 - 0.54 = 0.96. That matches the given value. So yeah, that makes sense.\n",

The options are A) 0.5, B) 0.6, C) 0.7, D) 0.8, E) 0.9.\n\nHmm, right. So first, I remember that when two events are independent, the probability of both occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. That is, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B).\n\nBut wait, the problem gives me P(A) as 0.6 and P(at least one of A or B) as 0.96. I think the formula for the probability that at least one of two events occurs is P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Oh right, because if you just add them, you double count the overlap where both happen.\n\nSince A and B are independent, P(A and B) is P(A)*P(B). So I can plug that into the formula.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\nP(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)*P(B)\n\nWe know P(A or B) is 0.96 and P(A) is 0.6.

P(B) minus 0.6 P(B) is 0.4 P(B). So the equation becomes:\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4 P(B)\n\nNow, I need to solve for P(B).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe problem states that events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6, and the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. I need to find the probability that event B occurs. The options are given as A)0.5, B)0.6, C)0.7, D)0.8, E)0.9.\n\nHmm, I remember that for independent events, the probability of both occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. Also, the probability of at least one of them happening can be found using the formula P(A \u2228 B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2227 B). Since they're independent, P(A \u2227 B) is P(A)*P(B).\n\nSo, let's write down what we know:\n\nP(A) = 0.6\nP(A \u2228 B) = 0.96\nA and B are independent, so P(A \u2227 B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.6 * P(B)\n\nNow, substituting into the formula for P(A \u2228 B):\n\n0.96 = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)*P(B)\nWe can plug in P(A) as 0.6:\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B))\n\nLet me simplify the right side. Let's combine the terms with P(B):\n\n0.6 + P(B)*(1 - 0.6) = 0.96\nSo, 0.6 + 0.4 * P(B) = 0.96\n\nNow, subtract 0.6 from both sides:\n\n0.4 * P(B) = 0.96 - 0.6\n0.4 * P(B) = 0.36\n\nTo find P(B), divide both sides by 0.4:\n\nP(B) = 0.36 / 0.4\n\nCalculating that, 0.36 divided by 0.4 is the same as 36/40, which simplifies to 0.9? Wait, 0.4 times 0.9 is 0.36, so yeah. Wait, but 0.4 * 0.9 is 0.36, so 0.36 / 0.4 is 0.9? No, wait, 0.36 divided by 0.4: let me compute this again. 0.4 goes into 0.36 how many times?\n\nWait, 0.4 * 0.9 is 0.36. So 0.36 divided by 0.4 is 0.9. So P(B) is 0.9? But wait, let me check the options. Option E is 0.9. Hmm, but wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought perhaps the answer might be 0.8. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, another approach. Let me write the equation again:\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B))\n\nSo, 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B)(1 - 0.6)\nWhich is 0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4 P(B)\n\nSubtract 0.6 from both sides: 0.36 = 0.4 P(B)\n\nSo, P(B) = 0.36 / 0.4 = 0.9.\n\nYes, that seems correct.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe problem states that events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6, and the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. I need to find the probability that event B occurs. The options are given as A)0.5, B)0.6, C)0.7, D)0.8, E)0.9.\n\nHmm, I remember that for independent events, the probability of both occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. Also, the probability of at least one of them happening can be found using the formula P(A \u2228 B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2227 B). Since they're independent, P(A \u2227 B) is P(A)*P(B).\n\nSo, let's write down what we know:\n\nP(A) = 0.6\nP(A \u2228 B) = 0.96\nA and B are independent, so P(A \u2227 B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.6 * P(B)\n\nNow, substituting into the formula for P(A \u2228 B):\n\n0.96 = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)*P(B)\nWe can plug in P(A) as 0.6:\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B))\n\nLet me simplify the right side. Let's combine the terms with P(B):\n\n0.6 + P(B)*(1 - 0.6) = 0.96\nSo, 0.6 + 0.4 * P(B) = 0.96\n\nNow, subtract 0.6 from both sides:\n\n0.4 * P(B) = 0.96 - 0.6\n0.4 * P(B) = 0.36\n\nTo find P(B), divide both sides by 0.4:\n\nP(B) = 0.36 / 0.4\n\nCalculating that, 0.36 divided by 0.4 is the same as 36/40, which simplifies to 0.9? Wait, 0.4 times 0.9 is 0.36, so yeah. Wait, but 0.4 * 0.9 is 0.36, so 0.36 / 0.4 is 0.9? No, wait, 0.36 divided by 0.4: let me compute this again. 0.4 goes into 0.36 how many times?\n\nWait, 0.4 * 0.9 is 0.36. So 0.36 divided by 0.4 is 0.9. So P(B) is 0.9? But wait, let me check the options. Option E is 0.9. Hmm, but wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought perhaps the answer might be 0.8.

Let me think about the formula for the union of two events.\n\nThe formula for the probability that either A or B occurs is P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B). Oh wait, since they are independent, P(A \u2229 B) is P(A) * P(B), right? So substituting that in, the equation becomes P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)*P(B).\n\nI know P(A) is 0.6, and P(A \u222a B) is 0.96. Let me plug those values into the equation.\n\nSo, 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B)).\n\nHmm, let me rearrange that. Let me write it as 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) * (1 - 0.6). Wait, because 0.6 * P(B) can be factored as 0.6 * P(B), so the equation is 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6 P(B). So that's 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) (1 - 0.6). Because P(B) minus 0.6 P(B) is 0.4 P(B).\n\nWait, so 0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4 * P(B).\n\nLet me subtract 0.6 from both sides. 0.96 - 0.6 = 0.4 P(B). 0.36 = 0.4 P(B).\n\nSo P(B) = 0.36 / 0.4. Let me calculate that. 0.36 divided by 0.4. Hmm, 0.36 is 36/100, 0.4 is 40/100. So 36/100 divided by 40/100 is 36/40, which is 0.9. Wait, no, wait, that can't be right.

But wait, that seems a bit high because if both A and B have high probabilities, their union would be high. But let me double-check the calculations.\n\nAnother way: 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6 P(B)\n\nSo 0.96 - 0.6 = P(B) (1 - 0.6)\n\n0.36 = 0.4 P(B)\n\nP(B) = 0.36 / 0.4 = 0.9.\n\nWait, that's correct.

Let me plug those values into the equation.\n\nSo, 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B)).\n\nHmm, let me rearrange that. Let me write it as 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) * (1 - 0.6). Wait, because 0.6 * P(B) can be factored as 0.6 * P(B), so the equation is 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6 P(B). So that's 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) (1 - 0.6). Because P(B) minus 0.6 P(B) is 0.4 P(B).\n\nWait, so 0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4 * P(B).\n\nLet me subtract 0.6 from both sides. 0.96 - 0.6 = 0.4 P(B). 0.36 = 0.4 P(B).\n\nSo P(B) = 0.36 / 0.4. Let me calculate that. 0.36 divided by 0.4. Hmm, 0.36 is 36/100, 0.4 is 40/100. So 36/100 divided by 40/100 is 36/40, which is 0.9. Wait, no, wait, that can't be right. Because 36/40 is 0.9, but wait, 0.4 times 0.9 is 0.36. So that would give 0.6 + 0.36 = 0.96, which matches. So P(B) is 0.9?\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 0.9. But wait, that seems a bit high because if both A and B have high probabilities, their union would be high. But let me double-check the calculations.\n\nAnother way: 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6 P(B)\n\nSo 0.96 - 0.6 = P(B) (1 - 0.6)\n\n0.36 = 0.4 P(B)\n\nP(B) = 0.36 / 0.4 = 0.9.\n\nWait, that's correct. So the probability of B is 0.9. But wait, looking at the options, E is 0.9. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again. If P(B) is 0.9, then P(A \u222a B) is 0.6 + 0.9 - (0.6 * 0.9) = 1.5 - 0.54 = 0.96. Yes, that adds up.\n\nSo the answer is E) 0.9.\n\n\nThe events A and B are independent, and the probability of event A occurring is \\( P(A) = 0.6 \\). The probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is given as \\( P(A \\cup B) = 0.96 \\). Using the formula for the union of two independent events:\n\n\\[\nP(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\n0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 \\cdot P(B))\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n0.96 = 0.6 + P(B)(1 - 0.6)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B)\n\\]\n\nSubtracting \\( 0.6 \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n0.36 = 0.4P(B)\n\\]\n\nDividing through by \\( 0.4 \\):\n\n\\[\nP(B) = \\frac{0.36}{0.4} = 0.9\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that event B occurs is \\( 0.9 \\). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: E**",

So the probability is 0.9, which is option E.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If both A and B have a high probability, then their union can be high. Let me check another way. Suppose P(B) is 0.9.

Also, the probability of at least one occurring can be found using the inclusion-exclusion principle. Let me think about that.\n\nSo, the formula for the probability of at least one of A or B happening is P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) is P(A) * P(B). \n\nWait, let me write that down to make it clearer. \n\nP(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A) * P(B).\n\nWe know P(A or B) is 0.96, and P(A) is 0.6.

So:\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + x - 0.6x.\n\nWait, that's 0.96 = 0.6 + x(1 - 0.6), right? Because 0.6x is subtracted.\n\nSo, 0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4x.\n\nSubtract 0.6 from both sides: 0.96 - 0.6 = 0.4x.\n\n0.36 = 0.4x.\n\nHmm, so x is 0.36 / 0.4.

Well, 0.4 is the same as 2/5, so dividing 0.36 by (2/5) is the same as 0.36 * (5/2) = (0.36 *5)/2 = 1.8 / 2 = 0.9. So yes, x is 0.9.\n\nSo the probability of B occurring is 0.9, which is option E.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Are there any other possibilities or did I make a mistake in the initial setup?\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider that the probability of at least one of A or B is 1 minus the probability that neither occurs. So, P(A or B) = 1 - P(not A and not B).\n\nSince A and B are independent, not A and not B are also independent. So P(not A and not B) = P(not A) * P(not B) = (1 - P(A)) * (1 - P(B)).\n\nSo, 0.96 = 1 - (1 - 0.6)(1 - x).\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n0.96 = 1 - (0.4)(1 - x).\n\nSo, 0.96 = 1 - 0.4 + 0.4x.\n\nWait, because (1 - x) multiplied by 0.4 is 0.4(1 -x) = 0.4 - 0.4x. So,\n\n0.96 = 1 - (0.4 - 0.4x) = 1 - 0.4 + 0.4x = 0.6 + 0.4x.\n\nWhich brings me back to the same equation as before: 0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4x. So, same result.\n\nSo, x is 0.9 again. So yes, the answer is E)0.9.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the logic here. So I'll go with E as the correct answer.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe problem states that events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6, and the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. We need to find the probability that event B occurs. The options are A)0.5, B)0.6, C)0.7, D)0.8, E)0.9.\n\nHmm. I remember that for independent events, the probability of both occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. Also, the probability of at least one occurring can be found using the inclusion-exclusion principle. Let me think about that.\n\nSo, the formula for the probability of at least one of A or B happening is P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) is P(A) * P(B). \n\nWait, let me write that down to make it clearer. \n\nP(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A) * P(B).\n\nWe know P(A or B) is 0.96, and P(A) is 0.6. So plugging those numbers into the equation, we get:\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B)).\n\nLet me rearrange that equation. Let's call P(B) as x for simplicity. So:\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + x - 0.6x.\n\nWait, that's 0.96 = 0.6 + x(1 - 0.6), right? Because 0.6x is subtracted.\n\nSo, 0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4x.\n\nSubtract 0.6 from both sides: 0.96 - 0.6 = 0.4x.\n\n0.36 = 0.4x.\n\nHmm, so x is 0.36 / 0.4. Let me calculate that. 0.36 divided by 0.4 is the same as 36 divided by 40, which is 0.9. Wait, no, wait. 36/40 is 0.9? Wait, 40 times 0.9 is 36, yes. So x is 0.9. So P(B) is 0.9.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 0.9. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might mix up the signs. Let me go through the steps again.\n\nThe equation: 0.96 = 0.6 + x - 0.6x.\n\nCombine like terms: 0.6 + x(1 - 0.6) = 0.6 + 0.4x.\n\nSo 0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4x.\n\nSubtract 0.6: 0.36 = 0.4x.\n\nDivide both sides by 0.4: x = 0.36 / 0.4.\n\nCalculating that: 0.36 divided by 0.4. Well, 0.4 is the same as 2/5, so dividing 0.36 by (2/5) is the same as 0.36 * (5/2) = (0.36 *5)/2 = 1.8 / 2 = 0.9. So yes, x is 0.9.\n\nSo the probability of B occurring is 0.9, which is option E.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Are there any other possibilities or did I make a mistake in the initial setup?\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider that the probability of at least one of A or B is 1 minus the probability that neither occurs. So, P(A or B) = 1 - P(not A and not B).\n\nSince A and B are independent, not A and not B are also independent. So P(not A and not B) = P(not A) * P(not B) = (1 - P(A)) * (1 - P(B)).\n\nSo, 0.96 = 1 - (1 - 0.6)(1 - x).\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n0.96 = 1 - (0.4)(1 - x).\n\nSo, 0.96 = 1 - 0.4 + 0.4x.\n\nWait, because (1 - x) multiplied by 0.4 is 0.4(1 -x) = 0.4 - 0.4x. So,\n\n0.96 = 1 - (0.4 - 0.4x) = 1 - 0.4 + 0.4x = 0.6 + 0.4x.\n\nWhich brings me back to the same equation as before: 0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4x. So, same result.\n\nSo, x is 0.9 again. So yes, the answer is E)0.9.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the logic here.
