      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about averages and figuring out the percentage of students who passed. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of problems, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nAlright, the problem says that the passing students had an average of 83, and the failing students had an average of 55. The overall class average was 76. I need to find out what percent of the class passed.\n\nHmm, okay. So I remember that when you have two groups, the overall average can be found using a weighted average. That is, the average depends on how many students are in each group. So the passing students and failing students each contribute to the overall average based on their numbers.\n\nLet me denote the number of passing students as P and the number of failing students as F. The total number of students is then P + F.\n\nThe total sum of all the passing students' scores would be 83 * P, and the sum for failing students would be 55 * F. The overall total sum is (83P + 55F), and the overall average is 76. So the equation would be:\n\n(83P + 55F) / (P + F) = 76.\n\nI think that's the right setup. Now I need to solve for the ratio of P to F, or perhaps the percentage of P in the total.\n\nLet me rearrange this equation. Multiply both sides by (P + F):\n\n83P + 55F = 76(P + F).\n\nExpanding the right side gives 76P + 76F.\n\nNow, subtract 76P and 76F from both sides:\n\n83P +55F -76P -76F = 0.\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\n(83P -76P) + (55F -76F) = 0.\n\nThat's 7P -21F = 0.\n\nWait, so 7P = 21F.\n\nDivide both sides by 7: P = 3F.\n\nOh, so P is three times F. That means for every failing student, there are three passing students. So the ratio of passing to failing is 3:1.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the percentage of the class that passed. So the total number of students is P + F = 3F + F =4F.\n\nSo the fraction that passed is P/(P+F) =3F/(4F) =3/4 =0.75, which is 75%.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option E is 75%. Hmm, but let me double-check because I might have messed up the algebra.\n\nWait, when I did the equation:\n\n83P +55F =76(P + F)\n\nLet me compute the left and right sides again. Let me subtract 76P and 55F from both sides:\n\n83P -76P =76F -55F.\n\nSo 7P =21F. Yep, that's correct. So P=3F.\n\nSo the number of passing students is three times the failing. So the class is 3F + F=4F.\n\nThus, the percentage that passed is (3F /4F)*100 =75%. So the answer should be E)75%.\n\nBut wait, the options are A)44%, B)66%, C)68%, D)72%, E)75%.\n\nSo E is 75%, which matches our calculation. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I recall sometimes when averages are involved, the weights can affect it differently. Let me think of another approach, maybe using alligation.\n\nAlligation is a method where you subtract the lower average from the overall average and the higher average from the overall average to find the ratio.\n\nSo, the overall average is 76.\n\nPassing average is 83, failing is 55.\n\nSo, 83 -76 =7, and 76-55=21.\n\nWait, so the ratio of the number of failing to passing students would be the inverse of these differences. So 7:21, which simplifies to 1:3. So failing:passing is 1:3.\n\nWait, no, I think I might have mixed that up. Let me think. The alligation method says the ratio is the difference on the opposite side. So the difference between the higher and overall is 83-76=7. The difference between the overall and the lower is 76-55=21. So the ratio of the lower group (fail) to the higher group (pass) is 7:21, which is 1:3.\n\nSo the ratio of fail to pass is 1:3. So the number of failing students is 1 part, passing is 3 parts. So total parts are 4, and passing is 3/4, which is 75%. So same answer as before.\n\nHmm, so both methods give me 75%, which is option E. But wait, looking at the problem again, the overall average is 76. So maybe I made a mistake in the alligation method.\n\nWait, alligation formula is: the ratio of the two groups is the difference between the other group's average and the overall average. So, the ratio of failing to passing students is (83-76) : (76-55) =7:21=1:3. So the ratio is fail:pass =1:3. So the number of failing is 1x, passing is 3x.\n\nSo the percentage passed is (3x/(4x)) *100=75%. So yes, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, in the initial equation, I had 7P=21F, leading to P=3F. So the number of passing is 3 times failing. So the class is 4F in total. So the percentage is 3/4=75%.\n\nSo the answer should be E)75%.\n\nBut wait, the options are E)75%. So why is the correct answer not one of the other options? Let me check the question again.\n\nWait, the problem states that the passing average is 83 and failing is 55. The overall is 76.\n\nAnother approach: Let me assume the number of students. Let's say there are F failing students. So passing students are 3F.\n\nTotal marks: 83*(3F) +55*F = 249F +55F =304F.\n\nTotal students:4F. So average is 304F /4F=76. Which matches.\n\nSo everything checks out. So the percentage passed is 75%, which is option E.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the percentage of the class that passed, we start by setting up the problem using weighted averages. Let \\( P \\) represent the number of passing students and \\( F \\) represent the number of failing students.

The overall class average was 76. I need to find what percent of the class passed.\n\nWait, right, averages and weighted percentages. So, this is probably a weighted average problem. I remember that the overall average depends on the proportion of students who passed and failed.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Let's say that the number of passing students is P and the number of failing students is F. So, the total number of students is P + F.\n\nThe total marks for passing students would be 83 * P, and for failing students, 55 * F. The overall total marks would be 83P + 55F. The overall average is given as 76, so:\n\n(83P + 55F) / (P + F) = 76.\n\nHmm, I can write that equation down. Let me rearrange it. Multiply both sides by (P + F) to get rid of the denominator:\n\n83P + 55F = 76(P + F).\n\nExpanding the right side: 76P + 76F.\n\nSo, subtract 76P and 76F from both sides to get:\n\n83P -76P +55F -76F = 0.\n\nSimplify: 7P -21F = 0.\n\nWait, let me compute the coefficients again. 83P -76P is 7P, and 55F -76F is -21F. So, 7P -21F = 0.\n\nHmm, I can factor this equation. 7P = 21F. Dividing both sides by 7 gives P = 3F.\n\nSo, P is three times F. That means the ratio of passing to failing students is 3:1. Because if P = 3F, then F is P/3.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think. If P is three times F, then for every F, there are three Ps. So, the total number of students is P + F = 3F + F =4F.\n\nSo, the percentage of students who passed would be (P / (P + F)) * 100%. Substituting P =3F and P + F =4F, that becomes (3F /4F) *100 = 75%?

So, the ratio of P to F is 3:1. So, for every 4 students, 3 passed and 1 failed.\n\nSo, percentage passed is (3/4)*100=75%.\n\nBut wait, the options include 75% as E. But let me make sure because sometimes I might have misread the question. The question is about the percentage of the class that passed, which is the same as the proportion P/(P+F).\n\nSo, if P is 3F, then P/(P + F) = 3F/(3F + F) = 3/4 = 75%.\n\nSo the answer should be E)75%.\n\nWait, but the options are A)44%, B)66%, C)68%, D)72%, E)75%.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer was 75%, but I'm remembering a similar problem where the answer wasn't 75. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the equation. Let me check the initial setup again.\n\nThe overall average is 76, which is (Total points)/(Total students) =76.\n\nTotal points =83P +55F.\n\nTotal students = P + F.\n\nSo, (83P +55F)/(P + F)=76.\n\nMultiply both sides by (P + F):\n\n83P +55F =76P +76F.\n\nSubtract 76P and 55F from both sides:\n\n83P -76P =76F -55F.\n\n7P=21F.\n\nSo, P=3F.\n\nSo, the ratio of P to F is 3:1.\n\nTherefore, the percentage is 75%. So, the correct option is E)75%.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think about another approach. Maybe using alligation.\n\nThe passing average is 83, failing is 55. The overall is 76.\n\nThe difference between passing and overall is 83-76=7.\n\nThe difference between overall and failing is 76-55=21.\n\nSo, the ratio of failing to passing is 7:21 = 1:3. Wait, no, in alligation, the ratio is inverse. So, the ratio is (76-55) : (83-76) =21:7 =3:1.\n\nWait, no, I think I got that backwards. Alligation method is: the ratio of the number of failing to passing students is (83 -76) : (76 -55) = 7:21=1:3.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the formula is that the ratio of the two groups is inversely proportional to the distances from the overall average.\n\nSo, the ratio of failing to passing students is (83 -76) : (76 -55) =7:21=1:3.\n\nSo, the ratio of failing:passing is 1:3. So, for every 3 passing, 1 failing. So, the total is 4 parts, 3 passed. So, 75% passed.\n\nSo that confirms the same result as before. So the answer is E)75%.\n",

Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the equation. Let me check the initial setup again.\n\nThe overall average is 76, which is (Total points)/(Total students) =76.\n\nTotal points =83P +55F.\n\nTotal students = P + F.\n\nSo, (83P +55F)/(P + F)=76.\n\nMultiply both sides by (P + F):\n\n83P +55F =76P +76F.\n\nSubtract 76P and 55F from both sides:\n\n83P -76P =76F -55F.\n\n7P=21F.\n\nSo, P=3F.\n\nSo, the ratio of P to F is 3:1.\n\nTherefore, the percentage is 75%. So, the correct option is E)75%.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think about another approach. Maybe using alligation.\n\nThe passing average is 83, failing is 55. The overall is 76.\n\nThe difference between passing and overall is 83-76=7.\n\nThe difference between overall and failing is 76-55=21.\n\nSo, the ratio of failing to passing is 7:21 = 1:3. Wait, no, in alligation, the ratio is inverse. So, the ratio is (76-55) : (83-76) =21:7 =3:1.\n\nWait, no, I think I got that backwards. Alligation method is: the ratio of the number of failing to passing students is (83 -76) : (76 -55) = 7:21=1:3.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the formula is that the ratio of the two groups is inversely proportional to the distances from the overall average.\n\nSo, the ratio of failing to passing students is (83 -76) : (76 -55) =7:21=1:3.\n\nSo, the ratio of failing:passing is 1:3. So, for every 3 passing, 1 failing. So, the total is 4 parts, 3 passed. So, 75% passed.\n\nSo that confirms the same result as before. So the answer is E)75%.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting the given data:\n\n- Passing students had an average of 83.\n- Failing students had an average of 55.\n- The overall class average was 76.\n\nLet the number of passing students be \\( P \\) and the number of failing students be \\( F \\). The total number of students is \\( P + F \\). The total marks for passing students is \\( 83P \\), and for failing students, it is \\( 55F \\). The overall total marks is \\( 83P + 55F \\), and the overall average is given as 76. Thus, we can write:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{83P + 55F}{P + F} = 76\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\( P + F \\) to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n83P + 55F = 76(P + F)\n\\]\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n\\[\n83P + 55F = 76P + 76F\n\\]\n\nSubtracting \\( 76P \\) and \\( 55F \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n7P = 21F\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 7:\n\n\\[\nP = 3F\n\\]\n\nThis means the ratio of passing to failing students is \\( P:F = 3:1 \\). The total number of students is \\( P + F = 3F + F = 4F \\). The percentage of students who passed is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{P}{P + F} \\times 100 = \\frac{3F}{4F} \\times 100 = 75\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, the percentage of the class that passed is **75%**.\n\nAnswer: E",

The problem says that the passing students had an average of 83, and the failing students had an average of 55. The overall class average was 76. I need to find out what percent passed.\n\nWait, I remember something about weighted averages here. Like, the class average is somewhere between 55 and 83, which it is because 76 is in between. So the idea is that the passing and failing students' averages are like two groups, and their proportions in the class determine the overall average.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Maybe I can use variables to represent the number of students who passed and failed. Let's say P is the number of passing students, and F is the number of failing students. So the total number of students is P + F.\n\nThe total points from passing students would be 83 * P, and from failing students it's 55 * F. The overall total points is then 83P + 55F. The average for the whole class is (83P +55F)/(P + F) = 76.\n\nSo the equation is (83P +55F)/(P + F) =76. I can multiply both sides by (P + F) to get rid of the denominator. That gives 83P +55F =76(P + F).\n\nLet me expand the right side: 76P +76F. So the equation becomes 83P +55F =76P +76F.\n\nHmm, let's rearrange terms. Subtract 76P from both sides: 7P +55F =76F.\n\nWait, no, let me recheck. 83P -76P is 7P. And 55F -76F is -21F. So moving all terms to one side, it's 7P -21F =0.\n\nWait, 83P -76P is 7P, and 55F -76F is -21F. So 7P =21F. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me do this step by step.\n\nAfter expanding, 83P +55F =76P +76F.\n\nSubtract 76P and 55F from both sides: 83P -76P =76F -55F.\n\nSo 7P =21F.\n\nDivide both sides by 21: (7/21) P = F. Simplify 7/21 to 1/3, so P =3F.\n\nWait, wait, let me check that again. 7P =21F \u2192 P = 3F. So the number of passing students is three times the number of failing students.\n\nSo the ratio of passing to failing is 3:1. Because P is 3F. So for every one failing student, there are three passing. So the total students would be 3F + F =4F.\n\nSo the percentage of students who passed is (3F)/(4F) *100% \u2192 (3/4)*100% =75%. Wait, but wait, looking at the options, option E is 75%. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Because the overall average is closer to 55 or 83? Wait, 76 is closer to 83 than to 55. Wait, no, wait, 76 is 17 away from 55 and 7 away from 83. So it's closer to 83. So if the average is closer to 83, that would mean more passing students, right? Because their average is higher. So a higher percentage passed.\n\nWait, but according to my calculation, the passing students are 3/4, which is 75% passed. So that would make sense because 75% is a higher number, so the average is closer to 83.\n\nWait, but let's check. Suppose 75% passed, so 3/4. So P=3, F=1. Then the total is 4. The average would be (3*83 +1*55)/4.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*83 is 249, plus 55 is 304. Divide by 4, 304/4=76. Oh, that's exactly the average given. So that makes sense. So the percentage is 75%, which is option E.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again, option E is 75%. So that's the answer. But wait, wait, I thought I saw another way. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: Let me consider the difference from the overall average. The passing students are 83-76=7 points above the average. Failing students are 55-76= -21 points below the average.\n\nThe ratio of the number of students in each group is inversely proportional to these differences. So the ratio of passing to failing students is 21:7, which simplifies to 3:1. So same as before, 3:1 ratio. So the percentage passed is 3/(3+1) =75%.\n\nSo that's another way to get the same answer. So yeah, the correct answer should be E)75%.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about averages and percentages. Hmm, let's see. I remember that averages can sometimes be tricky when dealing with different groups. The question is asking what percentage of the class passed based on their averages.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. So, the passing students had an average of 83. Failing students averaged 55. The overall class average is 76. I need to find out what percent of the class passed.\n\nWait, this sounds like a weighted average problem. Because the overall average depends on how many students passed versus failed. So, the idea is that the class average is somewhere between 83 and 55, and it's 76. So, the percentage of students who passed must be such that when you take the weighted average of 83 and 55, you get 76.\n\nLet me think about how to set this up. Let's say the number of passing students is P and the number of failing students is F. So, the total number of students is P + F.\n\nThe total points for passing students would be 83 * P, and for failing students, it's 55 * F. The overall total points would be 83P +55F, and the average is (83P +55F)/(P + F) =76.\n\nSo, I can write the equation:\n\n(83P +55F)/(P + F) =76.\n\nHmm, but I have two variables here, P and F. I think I can let P be a certain fraction of the total. Oh wait, maybe it's easier to express everything in terms of the ratio of P to F.\n\nAlternatively, I can let the total number of students be 100 since we're dealing with percentages. Wait, wait, that might not be the right approach because the percentages depend on the ratio, not the absolute numbers. Maybe a better approach is to express F in terms of P.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation. Multiply both sides by (P + F):\n\n83P +55F =76(P + F).\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n83P +55F =76P +76F.\n\nNow, subtract 76P and 55F from both sides:\n\n83P -76P =76F -55F.\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n7P =21F.\n\nDivide both sides by 7:\n\nP =3F.\n\nWait, so P is three times F. So the ratio of P to F is 3:1. Because if P is 3F, then F is P/3. So for every 3 passing students, there's 1 failing.\n\nSo the total number of students is P + F =3F + F=4F. So the passing students are 3F out of 4F, which is 3/4, or 75%. But wait, wait a second. Let me check that.\n\nWait, because 3F is P. So P =3F. So F = P/3. The total is P + F = P + P/3 = (4P)/3. So the fraction of P is (P) / (4P/3) )= (P *3)/(4P) )= 3/4, which is 75%. So that would suggest the percentage of passing students is 75%, which is option E.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option E is 75%, which would be the answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this using the concept of weighted averages. The difference between the passing average and the overall average is 83 -76=7. The difference between the failing average and the overall is 76-55=21. So the ratio of the number of failing students to passing students is 7:21, which simplifies to 1:3. So, for every 3 passing students, there's 1 failing. So again, the ratio is 3:1, making the percentage of passers 75%.\n\nBut wait, the options don't have 75% as the correct answer. Wait, no, option E is 75%. So why am I doubting that?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me think again.\n\nThe method I used earlier is the \" allegation method,\" which is used in mixtures. The idea is to find the ratio of the two groups based on their distances from the mean.\n\nSo, the passing average is 83, failing is 55, and the overall is 76.\n\nThe difference between passing and overall is 83-76=7.\n\nThe difference between failing and overall is 76-55=21.\n\nSo the ratio of failing to passing is 7:21, which simplifies to 1:3.\n\nWait, so that's the ratio of failing to passing. So for every 1 failing student, there are 3 passing. So the total is 4 parts. So the percentage of passing students is 3/4, which is 75%.\n\nHmm, that's what I thought earlier. So the answer should be E)75%.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option E is 75%. So why is the correct answer not E? Did I do something wrong?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me think again. The ratio is failing to passing as 1:3. So, for every 1 failing, 3 pass. So the proportion of passers is 3/(3+1) )=3/4=75%.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer should be E)75%.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me cross-check with the equation.\n\nEarlier, I set up the equation as:\n\n(83P +55F)/(P + F) =76.\n\nAnd found that 7P=21F, so P=3F. So the ratio P:F is 3:1.\n\nSo the total is 3+1=4 parts, of which 3 are passers. So 3/4 is 75%, so E is correct.\n\nWait, but wait, the options don't include E as correct? No, no, the options are:\n\nA)44%\nB)66%\nC)68%\nD)72%\nE)75%\n\nSo E is 75%, which seems correct. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, using the ratio method, I get 75% as the percentage of passers. So why isn't that the answer? Or did I perhaps mix up the ratio?\n\nWait, another approach. Let me assume a certain number of students.\n\nSuppose there are 100 students in total. Let me say x are passers, and (100 -x) are failers.\n\nThe total points would be 83x +55(100-x).\n\nThe average is [83x +55(100 -x)] / 100 =76.\n\nMultiply both sides by 100:\n\n83x +5500 -55x =7600.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(83x -55x) +5500 =7600.\n\n28x +5500 =7600.\n\nSubtract 5500:\n\n28x =2100.\n\nx=2100 /28 =75.\n\nSo x=75, meaning 75% passed. So the answer is E)75%.\n\nThat's consistent with the earlier method. So why am I thinking maybe it's not correct? Maybe I made a mistake earlier, but in this approach, it's clear.\n\nWait, but why is the correct answer not among the options? Wait, the options do have E as 75%, which is what I got. So the correct answer is E.\n\nWait, but the options given include E as 75%, so that's the correct answer.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about averages and percentages. Hmm, let's see. I remember that averages can sometimes be tricky when dealing with different groups. The question is asking what percentage of the class passed based on their averages.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. So, the passing students had an average of 83. Failing students averaged 55. The overall class average is 76. I need to find out what percent of the class passed.\n\nWait, this sounds like a weighted average problem. Because the overall average depends on how many students passed versus failed. So, the idea is that the class average is somewhere between 83 and 55, and it's 76. So, the percentage of students who passed must be such that when you take the weighted average of 83 and 55, you get 76.\n\nLet me think about how to set this up. Let's say the number of passing students is P and the number of failing students is F. So, the total number of students is P + F.\n\nThe total points for passing students would be 83 * P, and for failing students, it's 55 * F. The overall total points would be 83P +55F, and the average is (83P +55F)/(P + F) =76.\n\nSo, I can write the equation:\n\n(83P +55F)/(P + F) =76.\n\nHmm, but I have two variables here, P and F. I think I can let P be a certain fraction of the total. Oh wait, maybe it's easier to express everything in terms of the ratio of P to F.\n\nAlternatively, I can let the total number of students be 100 since we're dealing with percentages. Wait, wait, that might not be the right approach because the percentages depend on the ratio, not the absolute numbers. Maybe a better approach is to express F in terms of P.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation. Multiply both sides by (P + F):\n\n83P +55F =76(P + F).\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n83P +55F =76P +76F.\n\nNow, subtract 76P and 55F from both sides:\n\n83P -76P =76F -55F.\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n7P =21F.\n\nDivide both sides by 7:\n\nP =3F.\n\nWait, so P is three times F. So the ratio of P to F is 3:1. Because if P is 3F, then F is P/3. So for every 3 passing students, there's 1 failing.\n\nSo the total number of students is P + F =3F + F=4F. So the passing students are 3F out of 4F, which is 3/4, or 75%. But wait, wait a second. Let me check that.\n\nWait, because 3F is P. So P =3F. So F = P/3. The total is P + F = P + P/3 = (4P)/3. So the fraction of P is (P) / (4P/3) )= (P *3)/(4P) )= 3/4, which is 75%. So that would suggest the percentage of passing students is 75%, which is option E.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option E is 75%, which would be the answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this using the concept of weighted averages. The difference between the passing average and the overall average is 83 -76=7. The difference between the failing average and the overall is 76-55=21. So the ratio of the number of failing students to passing students is 7:21, which simplifies to 1:3. So, for every 3 passing students, there's 1 failing. So again, the ratio is 3:1, making the percentage of passers 75%.\n\nBut wait, the options don't have 75% as the correct answer. Wait, no, option E is 75%. So why am I doubting that?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me think again.\n\nThe method I used earlier is the \" allegation method,\" which is used in mixtures. The idea is to find the ratio of the two groups based on their distances from the mean.\n\nSo, the passing average is 83, failing is 55, and the overall is 76.\n\nThe difference between passing and overall is 83-76=7.\n\nThe difference between failing and overall is 76-55=21.\n\nSo the ratio of failing to passing is 7:21, which simplifies to 1:3.\n\nWait, so that's the ratio of failing to passing. So for every 1 failing student, there are 3 passing. So the total is 4 parts. So the percentage of passing students is 3/4, which is 75%.\n\nHmm, that's what I thought earlier. So the answer should be E)75%.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option E is 75%. So why is the correct answer not E? Did I do something wrong?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me think again. The ratio is failing to passing as 1:3. So, for every 1 failing, 3 pass. So the proportion of passers is 3/(3+1) )=3/4=75%.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer should be E)75%.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me cross-check with the equation.\n\nEarlier, I set up the equation as:\n\n(83P +55F)/(P + F) =76.\n\nAnd found that 7P=21F, so P=3F. So the ratio P:F is 3:1.\n\nSo the total is 3+1=4 parts, of which 3 are passers. So 3/4 is 75%, so E is correct.\n\nWait, but wait, the options don't include E as correct? No, no, the options are:\n\nA)44%\nB)66%\nC)68%\nD)72%\nE)75%\n\nSo E is 75%, which seems correct. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, using the ratio method, I get 75% as the percentage of passers. So why isn't that the answer? Or did I perhaps mix up the ratio?\n\nWait, another approach. Let me assume a certain number of students.\n\nSuppose there are 100 students in total. Let me say x are passers, and (100 -x) are failers.\n\nThe total points would be 83x +55(100-x).\n\nThe average is [83x +55(100 -x)] / 100 =76.\n\nMultiply both sides by 100:\n\n83x +5500 -55x =7600.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(83x -55x) +5500 =7600.\n\n28x +5500 =7600.\n\nSubtract 5500:\n\n28x =2100.\n\nx=2100 /28 =75.\n\nSo x=75, meaning 75% passed. So the answer is E)75%.\n\nThat's consistent with the earlier method. So why am I thinking maybe it's not correct? Maybe I made a mistake earlier, but in this approach, it's clear.\n\nWait, but why is the correct answer not among the options? Wait, the options do have E as 75%, which is what I got. So the correct answer is E.\n\nWait, but the options given include E as 75%, so that's the correct answer.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage of students who passed, we analyze the weighted average of the passing and failing students' scores. The passing students had an average of 83, the failing students had an average of 55, and the overall class average was 76. \n\nLet the number of passing students be \\( P \\) and the number of failing students be \\( F \\). The total number of students is \\( P + F \\). The total score for the class is \\( 83P + 55F \\), and the overall average is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{83P + 55F}{P + F} = 76.\n\\]\n\nMultiplying through by \\( P + F \\) gives:\n\n\\[\n83P + 55F = 76(P + F).\n\\]\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\n\\[\n83P + 55F = 76P + 76F,\n\\]\n\n\\[\n83P - 76P = 76F - 55F,\n\\]\n\n\\[\n7P = 21F.\n\\]\n\nDividing through by 7:\n\n\\[\nP = 3F.\n\\]\n\nThis means the ratio of passing students to failing students is \\( 3:1 \\). The total number of students is \\( P + F = 3F + F = 4F \\). Therefore, the fraction of students who passed is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{P}{P + F} = \\frac{3F}{4F} = \\frac{3}{4} = 75\\%.\n\\]\n\nTo confirm, we can assume a total of 100 students. Let \\( x \\) be the number of passing students, and \\( 100 - x \\) be the number of failing students. The total score is:\n\n\\[\n83x + 55(100 - x).\n\\]\n\nThe average is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{83x + 55(100 - x)}{100} = 76.\n\\]\n\nMultiplying through by 100:\n\n\\[\n83x + 5500 - 55x = 7600.\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n28x + 5500 = 7600,\n\\]\n\n\\[\n28x = 2100,\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = 75.\n\\]\n\nThus, 75% of the students passed.

The question is about finding the percentage of students who passed based on their average scores compared to the overall class average.\n\nSo, the problem says that the passing students had an average of 83, and the failing ones had an average of 55. The overall class average is 76. I need to find what percent of the class passed.\n\nHmm, I remember that when dealing with averages and mixing groups, the concept of weighted averages comes into play. So maybe I can model this as two groups contributing to the overall average. Let me think: the passing group has an average higher than the class average, so they must make up a certain percentage that when combined with the lower average of the failing group, it brings the overall average to 76.\n\nLet me denote the percentage of passing students as P and failing as F. Since it's a class, P + F should equal 100%, right? Or since percentages, maybe I can represent them as fractions of the class. Alternatively, perhaps using variables for the number of students might be easier.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to let the number of passing students be 'p' and failing be 'f'. Then, the total number of students is p + f. The total marks would be 83p (from passers) plus 55f (from failers). The overall average is (83p +55f)/(p +f) =76.\n\nSo, let me set up the equation:\n\n(83p +55f)/(p +f) =76\n\nI can multiply both sides by (p +f) to get rid of the denominator:\n\n83p +55f =76(p +f)\n\nLet me expand the right side:\n\n83p +55f =76p +76f\n\nNow, subtract 76p and 55f from both sides to group like terms:\n\n83p -76p =76f -55f\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n7p =21f\n\nDivide both sides by 7:\n\np =3f\n\nSo, the number of passing students is three times the number of failing students. So, if I let f be the number of failing students, then p=3f. The total number of students is p +f =3f +f=4f.\n\nSo, the proportion of passing students is p/(p+f) =3f/(4f)=3/4. Wait, that's 75%, but wait, that can't be right because the options don't have 75% as the correct one? Wait, no, option E is 75%. Wait, but wait, let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, let me re-do the equation step:\n\n83p +55f =76p +76f\n\nSubtract 76p and 55f from both sides:\n\n83p -76p =76f -55f\n\nWhich is 7p =21f. So, p =3f. So the ratio of p to f is 3:1.\n\nSo, the total is 3+1=4 parts. So, passing students make up 3/4, which is 75%. But looking at the options, E is 75%, but let me check the options again.\n\nWait, the options are A)44%, B)66%, C)68%, D)72%, E)75%.\n\nHmm, so according to my calculation, the answer would be E)75%. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake somewhere because the question is from a test and 75% seems a bit high. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps using alligation. The idea is to find the ratio of the two groups.\n\nThe average of passers is 83, and failers is 55. The overall average is 76.\n\nThe distance from the overall average to the passers' average is 83-76=7.\n\nThe distance from the overall average to the failers' average is 76-55=21.\n\nSo, the ratio of the number of failers to passers is 7:21, which simplifies to 1:3.\n\nWait, that would mean that for every 1 failing student, there are 3 passing students. So the ratio is 3:1 (passers to failers). So the total is 4 parts, and passers are 3 parts. So 3/4 is 75%.\n\nSo that's the same as before. So the percentage is 75%, which is option E.\n\nBut wait, the options have E as 75%, but the correct answer in similar problems I've seen before is sometimes not that straightforward. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting the ratio backwards. In alligation, the ratio is inversely proportional to the distances. So, the ratio of passers to failers is the inverse of the distances. Because the ratio is (distance of failers) : (distance of passers).\n\nWait, wait, let me think. The alligation method says that the ratio of the two groups is proportional to the distances from the mean. So, the ratio of passers to failers is (76-55) : (83-76) = 21:7 = 3:1.\n\nWait, no, that would mean the ratio is 3:1 of passers to failers. So, for every 1 failing student, there are 3 passing. So total is 4, passers are 3, which is 75%.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes I mix up the ratio. Let me confirm:\n\nThe alligation method: the ratio is (higher average - overall average) : (overall average - lower average). So, (83-76) is 7, and (76-55)=21. So the ratio is 7:21, which is 1:3. So the ratio of failers to passers is 1:3.\n\nSo, for every 1 failing student, there are 3 passing. So the number of passers is 3 times that of failers. So the proportion of passers is 3/(3+1) = 75%.\n\nSo the answer should be E)75%.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 75%. So that's the choice.\n\nWait, but I remember a similar problem where the answer was 72%, which is option D. Did I make a mistake in the alligation?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me assume that the number of passing students is p, and the number of failing is f.\n\nThe total marks would be 83p +55f.\n\nThe average is (83p +55f)/(p +f) =76.\n\nSo, 83p +55f =76p +76f.\n\nWhich simplifies to 7p=21f \u2192 p=3f.\n\nSo, p=3f \u2192 so the number of passers is three times the number of failers.\n\nSo, the total number of students is 3f +f=4f.\n\nSo, the fraction of passers is 3f/4f=3/4=75%.\n\nHmm, this seems correct. So the answer should be E)75%.\n\nBut wait, the option E is 75%, which is what I'm getting. So maybe that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Another way to approach it is by using variables for the number of students.\n\nSuppose there are x passing students and y failing students.\n\nTotal marks: 83x +55y.\n\nTotal students: x + y.\n\nAverage: (83x +55y)/(x + y) =76.\n\nMultiply both sides by (x + y):\n\n83x +55y =76x +76y.\n\nSubtract 76x and 55y from both sides:\n\n(83x -76x) = (76y -55y).\n\n7x =21y \u2192 x =3y.\n\nSo x is 3y. So the number of passing students is 3y, failing is y. So the total is 4y.\n\nSo the percentage of passers is (3y)/(4y) *100% =75%.\n\nSo, again, the answer is E)75%.\n\nWait, but the initial problem statement says \"what percent of the class passed?\" So, 75% passed.\n\nBut looking back, the options are A)44%, B)66%, C)68%, D)72%, E)75%.\n\nSo, E is 75%, which matches the calculation.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about averages in a class, and I'm supposed to find out what percentage of the class passed. Hmm, let's see. I remember that averages can sometimes be tricky, especially when dealing with groups and overall averages. I think I'll need to use some algebra here, maybe setting up equations based on what's given.\n\nThe problem says that passing students had an average of 83, failing students had an average of 55. The overall class average was 76. I need to find the percentage of students who passed.\n\nWait, right, the overall average is a weighted average of the passing and failing students' averages. So if I let the number of passing students be something like 'p' and the number of failing students be 'f', then the total average would be (83p + 55f) divided by (p + f) equals 76.\n\nHmm, so the equation would be (83p + 55f)/(p + f) = 76. But I have two variables here, p and f. I need another equation or a way to relate them. Oh wait, I can express f in terms of p, since the total number of students is p + f. Maybe I can let the total number be, say, 100 students for simplicity, but wait, no, because the percentages would then directly relate. Alternatively, I can express the ratio of p to f.\n\nLet me think. Let's rearrange the equation. Multiply both sides by (p + f) to get rid of the denominator. So 83p +55f =76(p +f). Let me expand that: 83p +55f =76p +76f.\n\nNow, subtract 76p from both sides: 83p -76p +55f =76f. So 7p +55f =76f. Then subtract 55f from both sides: 7p =21f. Oh, so 7p =21f. Dividing both sides by 7, we get p=3f. So the number of passing students is three times the number of failing students.\n\nWait, so if p is three times f, then the ratio of p to f is 3:1. So for every one failing student, there are three passing ones. So the total number of students is p + f = 3f + f =4f. So the fraction of students who passed is p/(p+f) = 3f/(4f) = 3/4, which is 75%. Oh, wait, but 3/4 is 75%, which is option E. But wait, let me double-check because sometimes I mix up ratios.\n\nWait, another way: if p =3f, then the fraction is p/(p+f) = 3f/(4f) = 3/4, yes. So 75% passed. But wait, the options don't have 75% as correct? Wait, let me check the options again. Oh wait, the options are A)44%, B)66%, C)68%, D)72%, E)75%. So E is 75%, which would be correct according to my calculation.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the algebra. Let's go through it again.\n\nStarting equation: 83p +55f =76(p +f).\n\nExpanding the right: 76p +76f.\n\nSubtract 76p and 55f from both sides: 83p -76p =76f -55f.\n\nThat gives 7p =21f.\n\nDivide both sides by 7: p =3f. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the ratio of passing to failing is 3:1. So in total, for every 4 students, 3 pass. So 3/4, which is 75%. So the percentage of the class that passed is 75%, which is option E.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me think about the averages again. If the overall average is closer to the passing average than the failing, that would mean more students passed. Because the overall average is 76, which is closer to 83 than to 55. Wait, 76 minus 55 is 21, and 83 minus 76 is 7. So the difference is smaller on the higher side, so maybe more students passed, which makes sense because the overall average is closer to 83.\n\nSo 75% passed, which is option E. So the answer should be E.\n",

So maybe I can model this with variables.\n\nLet me denote the number of passing students as P and the number of failing students as F. So, the total number of students is P + F.\n\nThe total marks for passing students would be 83 * P, and for failing students, it's 55 * F.

The overall average is 76, so the total marks would also be 76N.\n\nSo setting up the equation: 83x +55(N -x) =76N.\n\nLet me expand that: 83x +55N -55x =76N.\n\nCombine like terms: (83x -55x) +55N =76N \u2192 28x +55N =76N.\n\nSubtract 55N from both sides: 28x = 21N.\n\nWait, 76N -55N is 21N. So 28x =21N.\n\nDivide both sides by 7 to simplify: 4x =3N \u2192 x = (3/4)N. Wait, that can't be right because 3/4 is 75%, but the answer options don't have that as the correct approach? Wait no, wait, the question is asking for the percentage of the class that passed, which is x/N. So x = (3/4)N \u2192 x/N = 3/4 = 75%. But wait, 75% is one of the options, option E.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my math because I might have messed up somewhere.\n\nThe equation was 83x +55(N -x) =76N.\n\n83x -55x is 28x. So 28x +55N =76N.\n\n28x =76N -55N \u2192 28x=21N.\n\nSo 28x=21N \u2192 x = (21/28) N \u2192 21/28 is 3/4, so x= (3/4) N. So the percentage is 3/4 *100=75%, so option E.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be 66% or something else. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach it using alligation. The method where you take the difference between the passing and overall average and the failing and overall average.\n\nSo the passing average is 83, failing is 55. The overall is 76.\n\nSo the difference between 83 and 76 is 7. The difference between 76 and 55 is 21.\n\nSo the ratio of failing to passing students would be 7:21, which simplifies to 1:3. So for every 1 failing student, there are 3 passing ones. So the total is 4 parts, with 3 being passers. So the percentage is (3/4)*100=75%. So same as before.\n\nWait, but wait. The ratio of failing to passing is 7:21 \u2192 1:3, so the number of passers is three times the number of failers. So if failers are x, passers are 3x. Total is 4x.\n\nSo percentage passed is (3x)/(4x) *100=75%. So that's consistent.\n\nBut wait, I thought the answer was 66% earlier? Or maybe I confused it with another problem. Let me see the options. Option E is 75%, which seems to be the correct answer based on this calculation.\n\nBut wait, the options also have D)72% and others. Hmm. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use variables differently. Let me denote P as the fraction of passing students, so 1-P is the fraction failing.\n\nThe overall average is P*83 + (1-P)*55 =76.\n\nLet me compute that: 83P +55(1-P) =76.\n\nExpand:83P +55 -55P =76 \u2192 (83-55) P +55 =76 \u2192 28P =76-55=21 \u2192 P=21/28=3/4=0.75 \u2192 75%.\n\nYes, same result. So the correct answer should be E)75%.\n\nWait, but looking back, the problem says 'what percent of the class passed?' So if 75% passed, that would mean the answer is E. But why do I have a conflicting thought that maybe the answer is 66%? Oh, perhaps I'm mixing up the ratio.\n\nWait, in the alligation method, the ratio of the number of failing to passing is 1:3. So the number of failing is 1 part, passing is 3 parts. So the total is 4 parts. So the percentage of passers is 3/4 (75%), which is E.\n\nSo yeah, I'm confident now. The correct answer is E)75%.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the percentage of students who passed based on their averages. Hmm, let me think. The passing students averaged 83, and the failing ones averaged 55. The overall class average was 76. I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of problems, but I think it's a weighted average situation.\n\nWait, right. The overall average is a weighted average of the two groups\u2014passing and failing. So I need to figure out how much each group contributes to that 76 average. Let me denote the percentage of passing students as P and failing as F. But since the class is made up of these two groups, P + F should equal 100%, or 1 if we're working in fractions.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the number of students.
