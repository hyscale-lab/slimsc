      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a ribbon that's been reduced in a certain ratio, and I need to find its new length. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe original length is 30 cm. It was reduced in the ratio 5:3. Wait, ratios can be a bit tricky. I remember that ratios compare two quantities. So, the original length is being compared to the new length with a ratio of 5 to 3. That means for every 5 parts of the original, the new is 3 parts.\n\nBut wait, how does the ratio apply here? Oh right, when something is reduced in a ratio, the ratio represents the original to the new. So if the ratio is 5:3, that's original:new. So 5 parts correspond to the original, and 3 parts to the new length.\n\nSo, the original is 5 parts, which equals 30 cm. That means each part is 30 divided by 5. Let me calculate that: 30 \u00f7 5 = 6. So each part is 6 cm.\n\nNow, the new length is 3 parts. So I multiply 3 parts by 6 cm per part. 3 \u00d7 6 is 18 cm. So the new length should be 18 cm.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 18. So that must be the answer.\n\nWait, another way to think about ratios. Maybe it's a scale factor. The ratio 5:3 means that the new length is (3/5) of the original. So 30 cm multiplied by 3/5. Let's see: 30 \u00d7 3 =90, then 90 \u00f75 is 18. Yep, same answer.

So, the original length is 30 cm. It was reduced in the ratio 5:3. Wait, does that mean the new length is 5:3 compared to something else? Or is it the ratio of the original to the new length?\n\nI think when something is reduced in a certain ratio, it usually means that the new length is a fraction of the original. Like, if the ratio is 5:3, maybe it's the ratio of the original to the new length. So, original : new = 5:3. That would make sense because if it's reduced, the new length should be smaller.\n\nSo, if original is 5 parts and new is 3 parts, then the original 30 cm is equal to 5 parts. Each part would be 30 divided by 5, which is 6 cm. So the new length would be 3 parts, which is 3 times 6, which is 18 cm. That would make the answer A)18.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: could the ratio be new to original? Like, 3:5? Because sometimes the order matters. If the ratio is 5:3, does that mean new to original or original to new? The problem says it was reduced in the ratio 5:3. Reducing usually means making it smaller, so I think the original is larger than the new. So original : new is 5:3. So original is 5 parts, new is 3 parts. So, yeah, that would make the new length 18 cm.\n\nAnother approach: Let's represent the original as 5x and the new as 3x. So, 5x = 30. Solving for x gives x = 6. Then the new length is 3x = 18 cm. So that's consistent.\n\nWait, but another possibility: maybe the ratio is given as reduced by 5:3, meaning that 5 is the original and 3 is the new.

So the original is 5 parts, and the new is 3 parts. So the original is 5 parts, which equals 30 cm.\n\nWait, no. Because 5 parts correspond to 30 cm. So each part would be 30 divided by 5. Let me do that. 30 divided by 5 is 6. So each part is 6 cm. Then the new length is 3 parts, so 3 times 6. 3*6 is 18. So the new length is 18 cm. Looking at the options, option A is 18. So I think the answer is A.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Sometimes ratios can be interpreted differently. Like, could it be that the ratio is 5:3 in the sense of reduction factor? Like, the reduction is 5:3, but that might mean the original to new is 5:3. So original is 5, new is 3. Which is what I thought earlier. So yeah, that would make the new length 18.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is saying it was reduced by a ratio of 5 to 3, which could imply something else. Oh wait, no, ratios are about proportion. So 5:3 as original to new. So 5 parts to 3 parts. So 30 cm is 5 parts, each part is 6 cm, so 3*6=18.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: ratios can be converted into fractions. So the original is 5 parts, the new is 3 parts. So the new length is (3/5) of the original. So 3/5 of 30 is 18. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nLet me check the options again. The options are A)18, B)30, C)6, D)15, E)12. So A is 18, which is what I got. So the answer should be A.\n\n\nThe problem states that the original length of the ribbon is 30 cm, and it was reduced in the ratio 5:3. This means the original length corresponds to 5 parts, and the new length corresponds to 3 parts. To find the new length, we first determine the value of one part by dividing the original length by 5:  \n\\[\n\\text{Value of one part} = \\frac{30}{5} = 6 \\, \\text{cm}.\n\\]  \nSince the new length corresponds to 3 parts, we multiply the value of one part by 3:  \n\\[\n\\text{New length} = 3 \\times 6 = 18 \\, \\text{cm}.\n\\]  \nThus, the new length of the ribbon is 18 cm. Among the given options, the correct answer is **A) 18**.\n\nAnswer: A",

The question says that the length of a ribbon was originally 30 cm, and it was reduced in the ratio 5:3. I need to find out its new length. Hmm, ratios can sometimes be a bit tricky, but I think I can handle this.\n\nWait, ratio problems. So, the ribbon was reduced by the ratio 5:3. I'm trying to remember what that means exactly. When something is reduced in a certain ratio, does that mean it's scaled down by that ratio? Like, if the original is 5 parts, the new is 3 parts? Or is it the other way around? Oh right, I think it's the original compared to the new. So the ratio 5:3 would mean original:new is 5:3. So if I have 5 parts original, now it's 3 parts.\n\nLet me think. So the original length is 30 cm. So 5 parts equal 30 cm. So each part is 30 divided by 5. Let me do that calculation. 30 /5 is 6. So each part is 6 cm. Now, the new length is 3 parts, so 3 multiplied by 6 cm. 3*6 is 18 cm. So the new length should be 18 cm. Looking at the options, option A is 18. So that's the answer, right?\n\nWait, but wait a second. Another way to think about it: ratios can sometimes be confusing. Let me make sure. The ratio 5:3 refers to the original to the new. So original is 5, new is 3. So yes, 5 units to 3 units. So 5 units correspond to 30 cm. So 1 unit is 6 cm. So the new is 3 units, which is 18 cm. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to set up a proportion, it would be original / new = 5 / 3. So 30 / new = 5/3. Solving for new: cross-multiplying, 5 * new = 30 *3. 5 * new =90. So new =90 /5 =18. Yep, same answer.\n\nWait, but another thought. Sometimes when you reduce something, people might confuse whether it's multiplied by the ratio or divided. Oh, but in this case, the ratio is original to new, so it's a reduction. So the new is smaller than the original, which matches our answer of 18 being less than 30.\n\nLet me double-check the options. The options are A)18, B)30, C)6, D)15, E)12.
