      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again and try to figure it out. So, Silu and Meenu are walking, and Silu says she weighs 51 kg. Then she asks Meenu how much she weighs. Meenu doesn't want to say directly because she's overweight, but she gives a clue: \"I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight.\" Hmm, I need to find out Meenu's weight based on that statement.\n\nWait, wait. Let me parse that. Meenu says, \"I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight.\" So, that's a bit confusing. Let me think. So, if I let Meenu's weight be 'x' kg, then according to her statement, her weight is 29 plus half of her weight. So, mathematically, that would be x = 29 + (x/2). Oh, right, because half of her weight is x divided by two.\n\nSo, I can set up the equation: x = 29 + (x/2). Now, I need to solve for x. Let's see. Subtract (x/2) from both sides to get x - (x/2) = 29. Simplifying the left side, x - x/2 is the same as (2x - x)/2, which is x/2. So, x/2 = 29.\n\nTo find x, I can multiply both sides by 2. So, x = 29 * 2 = 58. So, Meenu's weight is 58 kg. Let me check the options. Option D is 58, so that's probably the answer.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, if Meenu weighs 58 kg, then half of that is 29. Adding 29 to 29 gives 58. Yep, that adds up correctly. So the equation checks out.\n\nAnother way to think about it: Meenu's weight is equal to 29 plus half her weight. So, if I take away half her weight from both sides, the other half must be 29. So, half her weight is 29, which means her full weight is 58. That makes sense.\n\nI don't think I missed anything here.

Let me break it down. So, her weight equals 29 plus half her weight. That sounds like an equation where I can solve for her weight.\n\nLet me assign a variable. Let's say Meenu's weight is M kg. According to her statement, M = 29 + (1/2)M. Oh, right, because half of her weight is (1/2)M. So the equation is M = 29 + 0.5M.\n\nNow, I need to solve for M. Let's subtract 0.5M from both sides to get the M terms on one side. So M - 0.5M = 29. That simplifies to 0.5M = 29.\n\nTo find M, I'll divide both sides by 0.5. So M = 29 / 0.5. Dividing by 0.5 is the same as multiplying by 2. So 29 * 2 is 58. Wait, so M equals 58 kg?\n\nLet me double-check that. If Meenu weighs 58 kg, then half of her weight is 29 kg.

Meenu doesn't want to tell directly but says she weighs 29 kg plus half of her weight. Hmm, that's a bit confusing, but I think I can figure it out.\n\nWait, Meenu says, \"I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight.\" So she's giving a statement that includes her own weight in a way. Let me break it down. So, her weight equals 29 plus half her weight. That sounds like an equation where I can solve for her weight.\n\nLet me assign a variable. Let's say Meenu's weight is M kg. According to her statement, M = 29 + (1/2)M. Oh, right, because half of her weight is (1/2)M. So the equation is M = 29 + 0.5M.\n\nNow, I need to solve for M. Let's subtract 0.5M from both sides to get the M terms on one side. So M - 0.5M = 29. That simplifies to 0.5M = 29.\n\nTo find M, I'll divide both sides by 0.5. So M = 29 / 0.5. Dividing by 0.5 is the same as multiplying by 2. So 29 * 2 is 58. Wait, so M equals 58 kg?\n\nLet me double-check that. If Meenu weighs 58 kg, then half of her weight is 29 kg. Adding that to the 29 kg she mentioned, 29 + 29 = 58. Yep, that makes sense. So her weight is 58 kg.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D is 58. So the answer should be D. Let me just make sure I didn't mix up any steps. Oh, right, because the equation setup was correct, and the math checks out.\n\n\nMeenu's weight can be determined using the information provided. Let \\( M \\) represent Meenu's weight in kilograms. According to her statement, her weight is 29 kg plus half of her weight, which translates to the equation:\n\n\\[\nM = 29 + \\frac{1}{2}M\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( M \\), subtract \\( \\frac{1}{2}M \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\nM - \\frac{1}{2}M = 29\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}M = 29\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to isolate \\( M \\):\n\n\\[\nM = 58\n\\]\n\nThus, Meenu weighs 58 kg. Verifying this, if \\( M = 58 \\), then half of her weight is \\( 29 \\), and adding this to 29 gives \\( 29 + 29 = 58 \\), confirming the solution is correct. The answer corresponds to option D.\n\nAnswer: D",
