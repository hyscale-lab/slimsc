      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about the average weight of oarsmen increasing when one person is replaced. Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nAlright, the problem says there are 10 oarsmen in a boat. Their average weight is increased by 1.8 kg when one of them, who weighs 53 kg, is replaced by a new man. I need to find the weight of this new man. The options are A)71, B)62, C)43, D)67, E)40.\n\nHmm. Let me think about averages. The average is total divided by the number of people. So, if the average increases, the total must have gone up. \n\nSo, initially, there are 10 oarsmen. Let's denote the average weight before replacement as A. The total weight would be 10 * A. \n\nAfter replacement, the average increases by 1.8 kg, so the new average is A + 1.8. The total weight now is 10 * (A + 1.8).\n\nWait, but the total change is because one person left and another came in. The person who left weighed 53 kg, and the new person's weight is what we're trying to find. Let's call the new man's weight W.\n\nSo, the initial total was 10A. After replacement, the total is 10A - 53 + W, right? Because we subtract the old weight and add the new one.\n\nAnd this new total is equal to 10*(A + 1.8). So I can set up the equation:\n\n10A -53 + W = 10(A + 1.8)\n\nLet me expand the right side: 10A + 18.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n10A -53 + W = 10A + 18\n\nHmm, if I subtract 10A from both sides, they cancel out. That leaves:\n\n-53 + W = 18\n\nSo, solving for W: W = 18 + 53 = 71.\n\nWait, that's 71 kg. Looking at the options, option A is 71. So the new man must weigh 71 kg. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check my reasoning. The average went up by 1.8 kg for 10 people, so the total increased by 1.8 * 10 = 18 kg. The new person must have added that 18 kg more than the person he replaced. The person replaced was 53 kg, so new person is 53 + 18 = 71. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nI think I did that right. So the answer should be A)71.\n",

The person who was replaced weighed 53 kg. We need to find the weight of the new man.\n\nWait, right, the average weight is total weight divided by the number of people. Since the number of oarsmen remains the same (10), only the total weight changes. So, when one person is replaced, the total weight increases by a certain amount, which causes the average to go up by 1.8 kg.\n\nLet me think. The original average was, let's see, the total weight before replacement divided by 10. After replacement, the new total is (old total - 53 + new weight) divided by 10, and this new average is 1.8 kg higher.\n\nSo the increase in average is (new total - old total) / 10 = 1.8 kg. That means new total minus old total is 10 * 1.8 = 18 kg. Because the average went up by 1.8 kg for 10 people, the total increased by 18 kg.\n\nWait, but the new total is (old total - 53 + new man's weight). So new total = old total -53 + new. So new total - old total = ( -53 + new ). Which equals 18 kg because that's the increase in total.\n\nSo, -53 + new = 18. Therefore, new = 18 +53 = 71 kg. So the new man must weigh 71 kg. Looking at the options, A is 71.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So the old total was 10 * old average. The new total is 10*(old average +1.8).

The options are A to E, with some numbers.\n\nAlright, so first, I think I should figure out the total weight before and after the replacement.

That means the new man must weigh 18 kg more than the man he replaced.\n\nBecause when you remove the old man and add the new one, the total increases by 18 kg. So, the new man's weight is 53 kg (the old guy's weight) plus 18 kg. Let me calculate that: 53 + 18 = 71 kg.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that logic.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about oarsmen's weights. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question says that the average weight of 10 oarsmen increases by 1.8 kg when one man is replaced by a new one. The man who was replaced weighs 53 kg. I need to find the weight of the new man.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The average weight is total weight divided by the number of people. Since there are 10 oarsmen, the average is total weight / 10.\n\nOriginally, the average weight is let's say A. So the total weight is 10*A. When one man is replaced, the new total weight becomes (10*A - 53 + new weight). The new average is A + 1.8. So the new total weight is 10*(A + 1.8).\n\nWait, so I can set up an equation here. The original total is 10A. The new total is 10A -53 + new man's weight. And this new total equals 10*(A +1.8).\n\nSo putting it all together: 10A -53 + new = 10A + 18.\n\nWait, because 10*(A+1.8) is 10A +18. So when I subtract 10A from both sides, I get: -53 + new = 18.\n\nOh, right, because the 10A cancels out. So then, new = 18 +53. That would be 71 kg.\n\nSo the new man weighs 71 kg. Looking at the options, option A is 71. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. The average goes up by 1.8, so each of the 10 people effectively adds 1.8 kg on average. So the total increase is 10 * 1.8 = 18 kg. The new man must have added 18 kg more than the previous total. Since the previous man was 53, the new one is 53 +18 =71. Yep, that makes sense.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about oarsmen's weights. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question says that the average weight of 10 oarsmen increases by 1.8 kg when one man is replaced by a new one. The man who was replaced weighs 53 kg. I need to find the weight of the new man.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The average weight is total weight divided by the number of people. Since there are 10 oarsmen, the average is total weight / 10.\n\nOriginally, the average weight is let's say A. So the total weight is 10*A. When one man is replaced, the new total weight becomes (10*A - 53 + new weight). The new average is A + 1.8. So the new total weight is 10*(A + 1.8).\n\nWait, so I can set up an equation here. The original total is 10A. The new total is 10A -53 + new man's weight. And this new total equals 10*(A +1.8).\n\nSo putting it all together: 10A -53 + new = 10A + 18.\n\nWait, because 10*(A+1.8) is 10A +18. So when I subtract 10A from both sides, I get: -53 + new = 18.\n\nOh, right, because the 10A cancels out. So then, new = 18 +53. That would be 71 kg.\n\nSo the new man weighs 71 kg. Looking at the options, option A is 71. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. The average goes up by 1.8, so each of the 10 people effectively adds 1.8 kg on average. So the total increase is 10 * 1.8 = 18 kg. The new man must have added 18 kg more than the previous total. Since the previous man was 53, the new one is 53 +18 =71. Yep, that makes sense.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the weight of the new man who replaces an oarsman, causing the average weight of 10 oarsmen to increase by 1.8 kg. \n\nThe original total weight of the 10 oarsmen is \\( 10A \\), where \\( A \\) is the original average weight.

The average weight of all of them is increased by 1.8 kg when one of the crew is replaced. The person who was replaced weighed 53 kg, and now a new man is on board. I need to find out how much the new man weighs.\n\nHmm, okay. So, averages can sometimes be tricky, but I think I remember that average is total divided by the number of items. So, maybe I should start by thinking about the total weights before and after the replacement.\n\nLet's see. The original average weight of the 10 oarsmen is something. Let me call that average 'A'. So the total weight before the replacement would be 10 * A.\n\nThen, when one of them is replaced, the average increases by 1.8 kg. So the new average is A + 1.8. The total weight after replacement is 10 * (A + 1.8).\n\nWait, but how much has the total weight changed? Well, the old total was 10A, and the new total is 10(A + 1.8) = 10A + 18. So the total weight increases by 18 kg.\n\nBut why? Because one person left and another came in. So the difference between the new man's weight and the old man's weight must be equal to the increase in total weight.\n\nThe old man weighed 53 kg. Let me call the new man's weight 'W'. So, when the old man leaves and the new one comes in, the change in total weight is (W - 53) kg. And this change should be equal to the total increase, which is 18 kg.\n\nSo, W - 53 = 18.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about oarsmen's weights. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question says the average weight of 10 oarsmen increases by 1.8 kg when one of them is replaced by a new man. The man being replaced weighs 53 kg, and I need to find the new man's weight.\n\nWait, averages. So average weight is total weight divided by the number of people. Since there are 10 oarsmen, the average is total weight /10. \n\nWhen one man is replaced, the total number remains 10, right? Because you take out one and add another. So the average increases by 1.8 kg. \n\nLet me think about the initial total weight. Let's call it T. So T = 10 * original average. When the new man comes in, the new total weight is T - 53 + new man's weight. Let's call new man's weight x.\n\nThe new average is (T -53 +x)/10. And this is equal to the original average plus 1.8.\n\nSo, original average = T/10. New average = (T-53 +x)/10. \n\nSetting up the equation: (T -53 +x)/10 = (T/10) + 1.8.\n\nLet me multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate the denominator. That gives T -53 +x = T + 18.\n\nWait, 1.8 times 10 is 18. Right. So, T -53 +x = T +18.\n\nHmm, I can subtract T from both sides. That leaves me with -53 +x =18. So, x=18 +53. \n\nWait, 18 plus 53 is 71? Let me do that again. 50 + 18 is 68, plus 3 is 71. So x is 71 kg. \n\nLooking at the options, option A is 71. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, did I do that right? Let me double-check. If the new man weighs 71 kg, replacing the 53 kg guy. The difference in total weight is 71-53=18 kg. So the total goes up by 18 kg. Since there are 10 people, the average increases by 18/10 = 1.8 kg. Which matches the problem statement. Yep, that makes sense. So the answer is A)71.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about oarsmen's weights. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question says the average weight of 10 oarsmen increases by 1.8 kg when one of them is replaced by a new man. The man being replaced weighs 53 kg, and I need to find the new man's weight.\n\nWait, averages. So average weight is total weight divided by the number of people. Since there are 10 oarsmen, the average is total weight /10. \n\nWhen one man is replaced, the total number remains 10, right? Because you take out one and add another. So the average increases by 1.8 kg. \n\nLet me think about the initial total weight. Let's call it T. So T = 10 * original average. When the new man comes in, the new total weight is T - 53 + new man's weight. Let's call new man's weight x.\n\nThe new average is (T -53 +x)/10. And this is equal to the original average plus 1.8.\n\nSo, original average = T/10. New average = (T-53 +x)/10. \n\nSetting up the equation: (T -53 +x)/10 = (T/10) + 1.8.\n\nLet me multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate the denominator. That gives T -53 +x = T + 18.\n\nWait, 1.8 times 10 is 18. Right. So, T -53 +x = T +18.\n\nHmm, I can subtract T from both sides. That leaves me with -53 +x =18. So, x=18 +53. \n\nWait, 18 plus 53 is 71? Let me do that again. 50 + 18 is 68, plus 3 is 71. So x is 71 kg. \n\nLooking at the options, option A is 71. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, did I do that right? Let me double-check. If the new man weighs 71 kg, replacing the 53 kg guy. The difference in total weight is 71-53=18 kg.
