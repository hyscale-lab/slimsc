The options are A)8, B)9, C)10, D)11, E)12.\n\nHmm, right. So, I remember that when you have two equations with the same variables, you can substitute one into the other to solve for a single variable. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe first equation is 6x - y = 24. The second equation is y = 3x. Oh, wait, substitution makes sense here. Since y is expressed in terms of x in the second equation, I can plug that into the first equation.\n\nSo, substituting y with 3x in the first equation, it becomes 6x - (3x) = 24. Let me write that out:\n\n6x - 3x = 24.\n\nWait, 6x minus 3x is 3x, right? So that simplifies to:\n\n3x = 24.\n\nNow, to find x, I just need to divide both sides by 3. So,\n\n3x /3 = 24/3,\n\nWhich simplifies to x = 8.\n\nLet me double-check that. If x is 8, then y should be 3 times 8, which is 24. Plugging these back into the first equation: 6*8 is 48, minus y (24) equals 24. 48 minus 24 is 24, which matches the equation. So that seems right.\n\nLooking at the options, A is 8.

So here, both equations involve x and y. Let's see, the first equation is 6x - y =24, and the second is y=3x. Oh wait, since the second equation directly gives y in terms of x, I can substitute that into the first equation. That makes sense.\n\nSo, substituting y=3x into the first equation.

So yes, 6x - 3x =24.\n\nNow, simplifying that. 6x minus 3x is 3x. So 3x equals 24. To find x, I just divide both sides by 3. So x equals 24 divided by 3, which is 8. Oh, so x is 8.

Thus, the value of \\( x \\) is \\( 8 \\).\n\nAnswer: A",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this algebra problem here, and I need to find the value of x. Let me read it again. The equations given are 6x minus y equals 24, and y equals 3x. Hmm, I remember from class that when you have two equations with the same variables, you can substitute one into the other to solve for a variable. \n\nWait, so the second equation says y is equal to 3x. That means wherever I see y in the first equation, I can replace it with 3x. Right, substitution. So let me try that.\n\nThe first equation is 6x - y = 24. Substituting y with 3x, that becomes 6x minus 3x equals 24. Let me write that down: 6x - 3x = 24. Okay, so 6x minus 3x is 3x. So now the equation is 3x = 24.\n\nTo solve for x, I need to get x by itself. So I'll divide both sides by 3. That gives me x equals 24 divided by 3. Let me calculate that: 24 divided by 3 is 8. So x is 8? Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me check my steps again. Substitute y with 3x in the first equation: 6x - 3x = 24. That simplifies to 3x=24. Dividing both sides by 3 gives x=8. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nBut wait, let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using elimination instead of substitution? Oh, but substitution is straightforward here because one equation is already solved for y. So substitution is the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, I could solve the system of equations another way. Let's see. The two equations are 6x - y =24 and y=3x. If I add the two equations together, maybe? Wait, no, adding them wouldn't make much sense because the y terms would be -y and y. Let me try that.\n\nAdding equation 1: 6x - y =24 and equation 2: y=3x (which can be written as 3x - y =0). If I add them, 6x - y +3x - y =24 +0. That would be 9x -2y =24. Hmm, but that doesn't help because I still have two variables. So substitution is better here.\n\nWait, another thought. Since y=3x, I can plug that into the first equation. Yep, that's what I did earlier. So, yes, x is 8. Looking at the options, option A is 8, so that must be the correct answer.\n\nJust to double-check, let me plug x=8 back into the second equation to find y. y=3x, so y=3*8=24. Now, plug x=8 and y=24 into the first equation: 6*8 -24 =48-24=24. Which matches the right side, so that's correct.\n\nI think that's solid. No mistakes here. So the answer is A)8.\n\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we start with the system of equations:\n\n\\[\n6x - y = 24 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y = 3x.\n\\]\n\nSince the second equation expresses \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\), we substitute \\( y = 3x \\) into the first equation:\n\n\\[\n6x - 3x = 24.\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side gives:\n\n\\[\n3x = 24.\n\\]\n\nTo isolate \\( x \\), divide both sides by 3:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{24}{3} = 8.\n\\]\n\nTo verify, substitute \\( x = 8 \\) back into \\( y = 3x \\) to find \\( y = 24 \\). Plugging \\( x = 8 \\) and \\( y = 24 \\) into the first equation confirms:\n\n\\[\n6(8) - 24 = 48 - 24 = 24,\n\\]\n\nwhich matches the given equation. Thus, the value of \\( x \\) is \\( 8 \\).\n\nAnswer: A",
