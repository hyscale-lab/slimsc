      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question here, and I need to figure out the reduction percentage when 120 is reduced to 96. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nAlright, percentage reduction. I remember that the formula for percentage decrease is ((Original Value - New Value)/Original Value) multiplied by 100. So the original value is 120, and the new value after reduction is 96. \n\nLet me plug in the numbers. So the difference between the original and new is 120 minus 96. Let me calculate that. 120 minus 96 equals 24. Oh right, so the amount reduced is 24.\n\nNow I take that 24 and divide by the original value, which is 120. So 24 divided by 120. Let me do that division. 24 \u00f7 120 equals 0.2. Oh wait, because 120 times 0.2 is 24. \n\nTo get the percentage, I multiply by 100. So 0.2 times 100 is 20. So that's 20%. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 20%, so that should be the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't mix up anything. Oh yeah, because the question is about the reduction, which is the decrease from the original. So I think I did it right. \n\nAnother way to think about it: if 120 is reduced by 20%, what do I get? 20% of 120 is 24, subtract that from 120 and you get 96. Yep, that matches. So definitely 20% reduction.\n",

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nWait, percentage reduction is basically the decrease divided by the original amount, multiplied by 100.

The question says, \"If 120 is reduced to 96, what is the reduction percent?\" The options are A)30%, B)40%, C)20%, D)10%, E)5%.\n\nHmm, right. I remember that percentage reduction involves finding out how much the original number was decreased and then expressing that decrease as a percentage of the original number. So the formula I think is: \n\nReduction Percentage = (Amount Reduced / Original Number) \u00d7 100%\n\nWait, yeah. So in this case, the original number is 120, and after reduction, it's 96. So the amount reduced must be 120 minus 96. Let me calculate that. 120 minus 96 is 24. So the amount reduced is 24.\n\nNow, I need to find what percentage 24 is of the original number, which is 120. So plug into the formula: (24 / 120) \u00d7 100%. Let me compute that.\n\n24 divided by 120 equals... let's see. 24 \u00f7 120 is the same as 24/120. Hmm, 24 times 5 is 120, so 24 is 1/5 of 120. Because 1/5 is 0.2, right? So 0.2 times 100% is 20%. So that's 20% reduction.\n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check my math. 120 minus 96 is indeed 24. 24 divided by 120 is 0.2. 0.2 multiplied by 100 is 20%. So the reduction is 20%.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 20%. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. Maybe I should think about it another way. Sometimes I get confused between percentage decrease and something else. But no, percentage decrease is always based on the original value. So yes, 24 is the decrease, and 120 is the original. So the percentage is definitely 20%.\n",
