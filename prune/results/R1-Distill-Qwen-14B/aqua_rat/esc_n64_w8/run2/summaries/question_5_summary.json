Hmm, right.\n\nWait, I remember that profit is calculated based on the cost price. So the selling price is the cost price plus 20% of the cost. Let me think about the formula. Oh right, the selling price equals cost price multiplied by (1 plus the profit percentage). But wait, the profit percentage is 20%, so that's 1.2 times the cost.\n\nSo the equation would be: Selling Price = Cost Price \u00d7 (1 + Profit%). \n\nGiven that the selling price is 360 and the profit is 20%, I can write that as 360 = Cost \u00d7 1.2. \n\nTo find the cost, I should divide both sides by 1.2. Let me calculate that. 360 divided by 1.2... Hmm, 360 divided by 1.2 is the same as 360 multiplied by 10/12, right?

So the selling price is cost price plus 20% of the cost price. Oh right, the formula I remember is Selling Price (SP) equals Cost Price (CP) multiplied by (1 + profit percentage).

Or, in percentage terms, Selling Price equals Cost Price multiplied by (1 + profit percentage).\n\nWait, profit percentage is 20%, so that's 0.2 in decimal. So the selling price is 120% of the cost price. Oh right, because 100% is the cost, and 20% is the profit added on top.\n\nSo the equation should be: Selling Price = Cost Price \u00d7 (1 + 20/100). That simplifies to Selling Price = Cost Price \u00d7 1.2. Or, in formula terms, SP = CP \u00d7 1.2.\n\nWe know the selling price is Rs. 360. So plugging that in: 360 = CP \u00d7 1.2. To find CP, I need to rearrange this. So CP would be 360 divided by 1.2.\n\nLet me calculate that. 360 divided by 1.2. Hmm, let's see. 1.2 times 300 is 360, because 1.2 \u00d7 300 = 360. So that would make the cost price 300. Oh wait, wait a minute, let me double-check.\n\nWait, 1.2 multiplied by 300 is indeed 360. So that would make the cost price Rs. 300. Looking at the options, option B is 300. So that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it: profit is 20%, so the cost is the base. If I take the cost as CP, then 20% of CP is the profit. So Selling Price is CP + 0.2*CP = 1.2*CP. So yes, same equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of ratios. The ratio of SP to CP is 120:100, which can be simplified. Dividing both by 20, it's 6:5. So SP is 6 parts, CP is 5 parts. If 6 parts equal 360, then 1 part is 360/6 = 60. So CP is 5 parts, which is 5 \u00d7 60 = 300. Same result.\n\nYeah, I'm pretty confident now. The cost price is 300, which is option B.\n",

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on profit calculations, but let me think this through.\n\nAlright, profit is always calculated on the cost price, right? So if the selling price is higher than the cost, that's the profit. So the formula for profit is: Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit. Or, in percentage terms, Selling Price equals Cost Price multiplied by (1 + profit percentage).\n\nWait, profit percentage is 20%, so that's 0.2 in decimal.

I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nThe question says that the trader sold the article at a profit of 20% for Rs.360. And we need to find the cost price. Hmm, cost price is the price the trader originally paid for the article, right?\n\nI remember that profit is calculated based on the cost price. So when they make a 20% profit, that 20% is of the cost price. Let me think of the formula. Profit is usually calculated as a percentage of the cost price. So the selling price would be the cost price plus 20% of the cost price.\n\nWait, another way to put it is: Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit. And Profit is 20% of Cost Price. So Selling Price = Cost Price + (20% of Cost Price). That simplifies to Selling Price = 1.2 * Cost Price.\n\nOh right! So if I let the Cost Price be CP, then the equation is 360 = 1.2 * CP. Because the selling price is 360.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait a second. Because 20% profit on cost price. So yeah, 1.2 times the CP gives the selling price. So I can rearrange that to find CP.\n\nSo, 360 = 1.2 * CP. To find CP, I need to divide both sides by 1.2. Let me do that. So CP = 360 / 1.2.\n\nHmm, what's 360 divided by 1.2? Let me calculate. Well, 1.2 is the same as 6/5. So 360 divided by (6/5) is the same as 360 * (5/6). Let me compute that. 360 divided by 6 is 60, and 60 multiplied by 5 is 300. So the cost price is Rs.300.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 300. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If the cost price is 300, a 20% profit would be 20% of 300, which is 60.
