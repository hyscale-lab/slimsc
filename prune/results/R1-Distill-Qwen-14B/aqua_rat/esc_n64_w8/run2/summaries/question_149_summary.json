      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to calculate the percentage gain of a merchant who bought oranges and then sold them. Let me see... Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on profit and loss calculations, but I think I can figure it out step by step.\n\nAlright, the merchant bought 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450. So, first I should find out the cost price per kg. To do that, I'll divide the total cost by the quantity. So that's 450 divided by 90. Let me calculate that: 450 \u00f7 90 equals 5. Oh, so the cost price per kg is Rs. 5.\n\nNext, the merchant sold the entire lot at Rs. 7.50 per kg. So I need to find out the selling price per kg, which is given as 7.50. Now, I think I should calculate the selling price for all 90 kg to see the total selling amount. So that's 7.50 multiplied by 90. Let me compute that: 7.50 \u00d7 90. Hmm, 7 times 90 is 630, and 0.50 times 90 is 45, so adding them gives 675. So the total selling price is Rs. 675.\n\nNow, to find the gain, I subtract the total cost price from the total selling price. So that's 675 minus 450. Let me do that: 675 - 450 = 225. So the gain is Rs. 225.\n\nWait, percentage gain is based on the cost price, right? So the formula is (Gain / Cost Price) \u00d7 100. Plugging in the numbers: (225 / 450) \u00d7 100. Let me calculate 225 divided by 450 first. Oh, that's 0.5. Multiply by 100, and that gives 50%. So the percentage gain is 50%.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 50%. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, wait a second. Did I do that right? Let me double-check the calculations. \n\nCost per kg: 450/90 = 5. Correct. Selling per kg: 7.50. So per kg profit is 7.50 - 5 = 2.50. Then for 90 kg, total profit is 2.50 \u00d7 90 = 225. Yes, that's the same as before. Then 225 over 450 is indeed 0.5, which is 50%. So I think I'm confident the answer is 50%, which is option A.\n",

I'm a bit rusty on my business math, but I'll try to think it through step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says the merchant bought 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450. Wait, so that's the total cost. Then he sold the whole lot at Rs. 7.50 per kg. I need to find the percentage gain. Oh right, percentage gain is basically the profit made over the cost price, expressed as a percentage.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total selling price. Since he sold all 90 kg at 7.50 per kg, I multiply 90 by 7.50. Let me do that. 90 times 7.5. Hmm, 7 times 90 is 630, and 0.5 times 90 is 45. So adding them together, 630 +45 is 675. So the total selling price is Rs. 675.\n\nNext, the cost price is Rs. 450. So the profit would be the selling price minus the cost price. That's 675 minus 450, which is 225. So he made a profit of Rs. 225.\n\nNow, to find the percentage gain, I think the formula is (Profit / Cost Price) * 100. So that's (225 / 450) * 100. Let me calculate that. 225 divided by 450 is 0.5, because 450 times 0.5 is 225. Then 0.5 times 100 gives me 50%. So the percentage gain is 50%.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 50%. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, did I miss anything? Let me double-check. The cost is for 90 kg, yes. And the selling rate is per kg, so multiplying by 90 is right. Profit is correct as 225, and the percentage is 50%. Yep, I think that's solid.\n",

Oh right, cost price is total cost divided by the quantity. So that's 450 divided by 90. Let me do that: 450 \u00f7 90 equals 5. So the cost price per kg is Rs. 5.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait a second, no, that's not right. Wait, 90 kg cost 450, so per kg is 450/90 which is 5. Oh yeah, that's correct. So Rs. 5 per kg is the cost price.\n\nThen he sold the whole lot at Rs. 7.50 per kg. So the selling price per kg is 7.5. So I need to find the profit he made and then calculate the percentage gain.\n\nWait, profit is selling price minus cost price. But since this is per kg, I can calculate the profit per kg first.
