      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so Roy has this problem where he's getting severe headaches and goes to the doctor. The doctor gives him 5 tablets and tells him to take one every 15 minutes. The question is asking how much time it will take Roy to consume all 5 tablets. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the timing here. So, he's supposed to take one tablet every 15 minutes. But wait, does that mean he starts taking them one after another every 15 minutes, or does the first one count as time zero?\n\nLet me break it down. If he takes the first tablet right away, at time zero, then the next one would be at 15 minutes, the third at 30 minutes, the fourth at 45 minutes, and the fifth at 60 minutes. Wait, no, that can't be right because 15 times 4 is 60, but since he's taking five tablets, the intervals would be between each dose. So maybe it's the first tablet at time zero, then the next four after each 15 minutes.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should model this. Let's list the times he takes each tablet:\n\n1. First tablet: time 0 minutes.\n2. Second tablet: 15 minutes after the first, so 15 minutes.\n3. Third tablet: another 15 minutes after the second, so 30 minutes.\n4. Fourth tablet: 45 minutes.\n5. Fifth tablet: 60 minutes.\n\nSo, the last tablet is taken at 60 minutes. But the question is, how much time will it take to consume all five? So the total time from the first to the last dose is 60 minutes. But wait, does that mean it takes 60 minutes in total? Because the first is taken at the start, and the last at 60. So the duration is 60 minutes from the first to the fifth.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: each tablet is taken every 15 minutes. So the intervals between each are 15 minutes. But for five tablets, how many intervals are there between the first and the fifth?\n\nLet me count: between tablet 1 and 2 is 1 interval (15 min), 2 to 3 another, 3 to 4 another, and 4 to 5 another. So that's four intervals. Each 15 minutes, so 4 x15 =60 minutes.\n\nSo the total time from the first tablet to the last is 60 minutes. So the time taken to finish all five is 60 minutes.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option E is 60 minutes. So that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you take something every x minutes, the total time can be (n-1)*x. So for 5 tablets, it's (5-1)*15 =60 minutes. So yeah, 60 minutes total. So the answer should be E.\n",

The question is asking how much time it will take Roy to consume all five tablets.\n\nHmm, so I need to figure out the total time. Let me think about it step by step.\n\nFirst, Roy takes one tablet every 15 minutes. So the first tablet is at time zero, right? Then the next one after 15 minutes, then another after another 15, and so on.\n\nWait, wait. Let me count the intervals. If he takes the first tablet immediately, then the time between each subsequent tablet is 15 minutes. So for five tablets, how many intervals are there?\n\nWell, for 2 tablets, he takes the first one, then waits 15 minutes for the second. So that's one interval. For three tablets, two intervals. So for five tablets, the number of intervals between them is four. Because the first tablet doesn't require waiting, but each tablet after that adds an interval.\n\nSo each interval is 15 minutes. Four intervals would be 4 times 15 minutes. Let me calculate that: 4 * 15 is 60 minutes. So the total time would be 60 minutes.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Let me visualize it. Let's say he takes tablet 1 at time 0. Then tablet 2 at 15 minutes, tablet 3 at 30, tablet 4 at 45, tablet 5 at 60. Oh, wait, that's right. So the last tablet is taken at 60 minutes, which is one hour. So the total time from the first tablet to the last is 60 minutes.\n\nSo looking at the options, option E is 60 minutes. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but another way to think: sometimes people get confused about whether it's n-1 intervals. Let's see, 5 tablets, so 5-1=4 intervals. Each 15 minutes. 4 *15=60. Yeah, that's correct. So the answer is E)60 Min.\n",

The doctor gives him 5 tablets and tells him to take one every 15 minutes. The question is asking how much time it will take Roy to consume all five tablets.\n\nHmm, so I need to figure out the total time. Let me think about it step by step.\n\nFirst, Roy takes one tablet every 15 minutes. So the first tablet is at time zero, right? Then the next one after 15 minutes, then another after another 15, and so on.\n\nWait, wait. Let me count the intervals. If he takes the first tablet immediately, then the time between each subsequent tablet is 15 minutes. So for five tablets, how many intervals are there?\n\nWell, for 2 tablets, he takes the first one, then waits 15 minutes for the second. So that's one interval. For three tablets, two intervals. So for five tablets, the number of intervals between them is four. Because the first tablet doesn't require waiting, but each tablet after that adds an interval.\n\nSo each interval is 15 minutes. Four intervals would be 4 times 15 minutes. Let me calculate that: 4 * 15 is 60 minutes. So the total time would be 60 minutes.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Let me visualize it. Let's say he takes tablet 1 at time 0. Then tablet 2 at 15 minutes, tablet 3 at 30, tablet 4 at 45, tablet 5 at 60. Oh, wait, that's right. So the last tablet is taken at 60 minutes, which is one hour. So the total time from the first tablet to the last is 60 minutes.\n\nSo looking at the options, option E is 60 minutes. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but another way to think: sometimes people get confused about whether it's n-1 intervals. Let's see, 5 tablets, so 5-1=4 intervals. Each 15 minutes. 4 *15=60. Yeah, that's correct. So the answer is E)60 Min.\n\n\nRoy is instructed to take one tablet every 15 minutes, starting immediately. For 5 tablets, there are 4 intervals between the first and last tablet. Each interval is 15 minutes, so the total time is \\( 4 \\times 15 = 60 \\) minutes. Therefore, it takes Roy 60 minutes to consume all 5 tablets.\n\nAnswer: E",

He needs to take them one after another, each 15 minutes apart. Wait, but how does the timing work here? Like, if he takes the first tablet at time zero, then the next one at 15 minutes, then another at 30 minutes, and so on.\n\nWait, but wait, how many intervals are there between five tablets? Let's see. If he takes the first tablet at time zero, then the second is after 15 minutes, third after another 15 (so 30 total), fourth after another 15 (45), and fifth after another 15 (60). So that's four intervals after the first one.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me recount. Five tablets mean four intervals between them. So each interval is 15 minutes, so total time is 4 * 15 = 60 minutes. But wait, that's the time from the first to the fifth. So the total time taken would be 60 minutes. But wait, the question is how much time to consume all five. So when does the last tablet get taken? At the 60-minute mark.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm thinking about it wrong. Let's think step by step. The first tablet is taken at time 0.

So the total time taken from the first to the last is 60 minutes. So the answer should be 60 minutes, which is option E.\n\nWait, but another thought. Sometimes, when you're taking something every 15 minutes, the first dose is at time zero, then the next four doses at 15, 30, 45, 60. So five doses in total. So the time from the first to the last is 60 minutes. So the total time required is 60 minutes.\n\nSo looking back at the options, E is 60 min. So the correct answer should be E.\n",
