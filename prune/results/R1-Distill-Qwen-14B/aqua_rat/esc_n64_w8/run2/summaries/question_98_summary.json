      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where a man is dividing Rs 8600 among his family members. The family includes 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews. Hmm, the question is asking how much each daughter receives. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should assign variables to the amounts each group receives. Since each daughter gets four times as much as each nephew, and each son gets five times as much, maybe I can let the amount each nephew gets be a variable, say x. Then, each daughter would get 4x, and each son would get 5x. That makes sense.\n\nWait, so let's see. The total amount is 8600, which is the sum of all the sons, daughters, and nephews' shares. So I need to calculate each group's total and sum them up.\n\nSo, the nephews: there are 2 of them, each getting x. So total for nephews is 2x.\n\nThe daughters: 4 of them, each gets 4x. So total for daughters is 4 * 4x = 16x.\n\nThe sons: 5 of them, each gets 5x. So total for sons is 5 * 5x = 25x.\n\nNow, adding all these together: 2x + 16x + 25x equals the total amount, 8600.\n\nLet me add those coefficients: 2 +16 is 18, plus 25 is 43. So 43x = 8600.\n\nTo find x, I divide both sides by 43. Let's calculate that: 8600 / 43. Hmm, 43 times 200 is 8600 because 43*200 is 8600 (since 43*2=86, so 43*200=8600). So x is 200.\n\nWait, so each nephew gets Rs 200. Then each daughter gets 4x, which is 4*200 = 800. So each daughter gets Rs 800.\n\nLooking back at the options, option E is Rs 800. So that's the answer.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Nephews: 2*200=400. Daughters: 4*800=3200. Sons:5*1000=5000. Wait, wait, wait, wait a second. Oh no, wait, wait. Wait, sons get 5x, which is 5*200=1000 each. So 5 sons would be 5*1000=5000. Daughters:4*800=3200. Nephews: 2*200=400. Adding these together: 5000 + 3200 is 8200, plus 400 is 8600. Oh, right, that adds up correctly. So each daughter gets 800, which is option E. So yes, that's correct.\n",

Each daughter gets four times as much as each nephew, and each son gets five times as much as each nephew. I need to find out how much each daughter receives.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. First, I think I should assign a variable to the amount each nephew gets because everything is compared to that. Let's say each nephew gets 'x' rupees. Then, each daughter gets four times that, so 4x, and each son gets five times, which is 5x.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the total amount given to all the sons, daughters, and nephews. Let's see:\n\n- Number of sons: 5, each getting 5x. So total for sons is 5 * 5x = 25x.\n- Number of daughters: 4, each getting 4x. So total for daughters is 4 * 4x = 16x.\n- Number of nephews: 2, each getting x. So total for nephews is 2x.\n\nAdding all these together should give the total amount, which is 8600. So the equation is:\n\n25x + 16x + 2x = 8600\n\nLet me add those up. 25x +16x is 41x, plus 2x is 43x. So 43x = 8600.\n\nTo find x, I'll divide 8600 by 43. Let me do that calculation. 43 times 200 is 8600, right? Because 43*200=8600. So x is 200.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me double-check. 43 times 200 is 8600. Yes, that's correct. So each nephew gets 200 rupees.\n\nBut the question is asking how much each daughter receives. Each daughter gets four times x. So 4x = 4 * 200 = 800.\n\nSo each daughter gets Rs 800.

Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the ratios of what each group (sons, daughters, nephews) are getting. The problem says each daughter gets four times as much as each nephew. And each son gets five times as much as each nephew. So, maybe I should assign variables to each of these.\n\nLet's let the amount each nephew gets be x. Then, each daughter would get 4x, right? Because it's four times as much. And each son would get 5x since it's five times.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the total amount given to each group. \n\nFor the nephews: there are 2 of them, each getting x. So total for nephews is 2x.\n\nFor the daughters: 4 daughters each getting 4x. So 4 * 4x = 16x.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, each daughter is 4x, so 4 daughters would be 4*(4x) = 16x? No, wait, no, wait. Wait, no, that's correct. Because each daughter is 4x, so four daughters would be 4*(4x) =16x.\n\nAnd the sons: 5 sons each getting 5x.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where a man is dividing Rs 8600 among his 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews. The question is asking how much each daughter receives. Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the ratios of what each group (sons, daughters, nephews) are getting. The problem says each daughter gets four times as much as each nephew. And each son gets five times as much as each nephew. So, maybe I should assign variables to each of these.\n\nLet's let the amount each nephew gets be x. Then, each daughter would get 4x, right? Because it's four times as much. And each son would get 5x since it's five times.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the total amount given to each group. \n\nFor the nephews: there are 2 of them, each getting x. So total for nephews is 2x.\n\nFor the daughters: 4 daughters each getting 4x. So 4 * 4x = 16x.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, each daughter is 4x, so 4 daughters would be 4*(4x) = 16x? No, wait, no, wait. Wait, no, that's correct. Because each daughter is 4x, so four daughters would be 4*(4x) =16x.\n\nAnd the sons: 5 sons each getting 5x. So 5*5x =25x.\n\nSo the total amount is the sum of all these: 2x (nephews) +16x (daughters) +25x (sons) = 43x.\n\nAnd the total amount is Rs 8600, so 43x =8600.\n\nTo find x, I can divide both sides by 43. Let's see: 8600 divided by 43. Hmm, 43 times 200 is 8600 because 43*200=8600. So x is 200. \n\nWait, so each nephew gets x=200. Then each daughter gets 4x, which is 4*200=800. So each daughter gets Rs 800.\n\nLooking at the options, E is Rs 800. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, let me double-check.

And each son gets five times as much as each nephew. So, I think I should assign a variable to the nephew's share and express the others in terms of that.\n\nLet's let the amount each nephew gets be x. Then, each daughter gets 4x because they get four times as much as each nephew. Similarly, each son gets 5x since they receive five times as much.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the total amount given to all the sons, daughters, and nephews. There are 5 sons, so the total for sons is 5 multiplied by 5x. That's 25x. For the daughters, there are 4 of them, each getting 4x, so that's 4 * 4x = 16x. The two nephews each get x, so that's 2x.\n\nAdding all these together: 25x (sons) + 16x (daughters) + 2x (nephews) = total amount which is 8600.\n\nSo, 25x +16x +2x = 43x. 43x = 8600.

The total is 8600, which breaks down into 25x +16x +2x =43x. 43x=8600, x=200. So each daughter is 4x=800, which is option E.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I add all the terms correctly? 5 sons *5x =25x, 4 daughters *4x=16x, 2 nephews *x=2x. Total is 25+16=41, plus 2 is 43x. Yes, that's correct. 43x=8600, so x=200. So the daughter's share is 800.

So, I need to translate the problem into mathematical terms.\n\nThe problem states that each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew. And each son receives five times as much as each nephew. So, if I let the amount each nephew gets be a certain variable, say 'x', then I can express the sons' and daughters' shares in terms of x.\n\nSo, let me define:\n- Let the amount each nephew receives be x.\n- Then, each daughter gets 4x.\n- Each son gets 5x.\n\nNow, the total amount is divided among 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews. So, the total can be written as the sum of all their shares.\n\nBreaking it down:\n- Sons: 5 sons each getting 5x. So, 5 * 5x = 25x.\n- Daughters: 4 daughters each getting 4x. So, 4 * 4x = 16x.\n- Nephews: 2 nephews each getting x. So, 2 * x = 2x.\n\nAdding all these up: 25x + 16x + 2x = total amount, which is 8600.\n\nWait, let me calculate that: 25x +16x is 41x, plus 2x is 43x. So, 43x = 8600.\n\nTo find x, I can divide 8600 by 43. Let me do that division. Hmm, 43 times 200 is 8600, right? Because 43*200 = 8600. So x would be 200.\n\nWait, wait, let me check that again. 43 * 200: 43 * 2 is 86, so 86 * 100 is 8600. Yes, that's correct. So x is 200.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking how much each daughter receives. Each daughter gets 4x. So 4 * 200 is 800. So each daughter gets Rs 800.\n\nLooking back at the options, E is 800. So the answer should be E.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to mix up the coefficients.\n\nWait, let's recalculate the total:\n\n5 sons *5x each: 5*5=25, so 25x.\n4 daughters *4x each: 4*4=16, so 16x.\n2 nephews *x each: 2x.\nTotal: 25x +16x +2x = 43x.\n\n43x = 8600 \u2192 x=8600/43 = 200. Correct.\n\nSo each daughter gets 4x = 800. So the answer is E) Rs 800.\n\n\nLet the amount each nephew receives be \\( x \\). According to the problem:\n\n- Each daughter receives \\( 4x \\).\n- Each son receives \\( 5x \\).\n\nThe total amount is divided among:\n- 5 sons: \\( 5 \\times 5x = 25x \\),\n- 4 daughters: \\( 4 \\times 4x = 16x \\),\n- 2 nephews: \\( 2 \\times x = 2x \\).\n\nThe total amount is:\n\\[\n25x + 16x + 2x = 43x\n\\]\nGiven that the total amount is Rs 8600:\n\\[\n43x = 8600 \\implies x = \\frac{8600}{43} = 200\n\\]\n\nEach daughter receives \\( 4x \\):\n\\[\n4x = 4 \\times 200 = 800\n\\]\n\nThus, each daughter receives Rs 800.\n\nAnswer: E",

Hmm, let's see. \n\nThe problem states that each daughter gets four times as much as each nephew, and each son gets five times as much as each nephew. I need to find out the amount each daughter gets. \n\nWait, let me break this down. Let's denote the amount each nephew receives as 'x'. Then, according to the problem, each daughter gets 4x, and each son gets 5x. \n\nSo, there are 5 sons, each getting 5x. That would be 5 * 5x = 25x. \n\nThere are 4 daughters, each getting 4x, so that's 4 * 4x = 16x. \n\nAnd the 2 nephews each get x, so that's 2 * x = 2x. \n\nAdding all these up should give the total amount, which is Rs 8600. So, 25x + 16x + 2x equals 43x. \n\nSo, 43x = 8600. To find x, I can divide both sides by 43. Let me calculate that. \n\n43 times what gives 8600? Let's see: 43 * 200 is 8600 because 43*200 is 8600. Wait, no, 43*200 is 8600? Let me check. 43*200 is 8600, yes, because 40*200 is 8000 and 3*200 is 600, so 8000+600=8600. So x is 200. \n\nBut wait, the question is about each daughter's share. Each daughter gets 4x, which is 4*200=800. So each daughter gets Rs 800. \n\nLooking at the options, option E is 800. So the answer should be E. \n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations. Because sometimes when I'm doing this quickly, I might make a mistake. \n\nSo, each nephew gets x=200. Sons get 5x each, so 5*200=1000 each. 5 sons would be 5*1000=5000. \n\nEach daughter gets 4x=800. 4 daughters: 4*800=3200. \n\nNephews: 2*200=400. \n\nAdding these: 5000+3200=8200, plus 400 gives 8600. That adds up correctly. So yes, each daughter gets 800. So the correct option is E.\n",
