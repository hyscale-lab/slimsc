      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the missing number. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details right.\n\nThe equation is [5 + ? \u00d7 19 - 15 -7] divided by [13 \u00d713 -156] equals 6. Hmm, alright. So I need to find the value of the question mark, which is a number in the numerator.\n\nLet me write this down to visualize it better. The equation is:\n\n(5 + ? \u00d7 19 - 15 -7) / (13\u00d713 - 156) = 6\n\nFirst, I should probably simplify both the numerator and the denominator as much as possible. Let's start with the denominator because that seems straightforward.\n\nThe denominator is 13 multiplied by 13 minus 156. So 13\u00d713 is 169. Then subtract 156: 169-156. Let me calculate that. 169 minus 150 is 19, and then minus 6 more is 13. So the denominator simplifies to 13.\n\nNow the equation looks like this:\n\n(5 + ? \u00d7 19 - 15 -7) / 13 = 6\n\nSince I know the denominator is 13, I can multiply both sides of the equation by 13 to get rid of the denominator. Let's do that.\n\n(5 + ? \u00d719 -15 -7) = 6 \u00d713\n\nCalculating 6\u00d713... 6\u00d710 is 60, 6\u00d73 is 18, so 60+18=78. So now the equation is:\n\n5 + ?\u00d719 -15 -7 = 78\n\nNow, let's simplify the left side. Let me add and subtract the constants first. So 5 minus 15 is -10, and then minus 7 is -17. So the equation becomes:\n\n-17 + ?\u00d719 = 78\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me make sure I add the numbers correctly. 5 -15 is indeed -10, then -10 -7 is -17. So the equation is:\n\n(5 -15 -7) + 19\u00d7? =78 \u2192 (-17) +19\u00d7?=78\n\nNow, I can rearrange this to solve for ?. Let me add 17 to both sides to isolate the term with ?.\n\n19\u00d7? = 78 +17\n\n78 plus 17 is 95. So:\n\n19\u00d7? =95\n\nTo find ?, I divide both sides by 19.\n\n? =95 /19\n\nHmm, 19 times 5 is 95 because 19\u00d75 is 95. So ? is 5.\n\nWait a minute, looking at the options, option C is 5. So the answer should be C.\n\nLet me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. \n\nDenominator: 13\u00d713=169. 169-156=13. That's correct.\n\nThen, numerator simplification: 5 -15 is -10, minus 7 is -17. So equation becomes (-17 +19?) =78. Adding 17 to both sides gives 19? =95, so ?=5. Yep, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should substitute 5 into the original equation to verify.\n\nLet's compute numerator:5 +5\u00d719 -15 -7.\n\n5\u00d719 is 95. Then 5 +95=100. 100-15=85. 85-7=78. So numerator is 78, denominator is 13. 78/13=6. Which matches the equation. So yes, the answer is correct.\n",

The numerator has 5, minus 15, minus 7, and then plus ?\u00d719. Let's compute 5 -15. That's -10. Then, subtract 7 from that. So, -10 minus7 is -17. So now the numerator becomes -17 + ?\u00d719.\n\nSo the equation is now (-17 + ?\u00d719) divided by 13 equals 6. Let me write that as (-17 +19?) /13 =6. \n\nI think I can multiply both sides by 13 to get rid of the denominator. So, multiplying both sides by 13 gives me (-17 +19?) = 6 \u00d713. What's 6 times 13? That's 78. So now the equation is -17 +19? =78.\n\nNow, I need to solve for ?. Let me rearrange this. So, I'll add 17 to both sides to isolate the term with ?. Adding 17 to both sides: -17 +17 +19? =78 +17. That simplifies to 19? =95. \n\nWait, 78 plus17 is 95? Let me check: 70 +10 is 80, plus 8 is 88, plus 7 is 95. Yep, that's right.\n\nSo now I have 19? equals 95. To find ?, I divide both sides by 19. So, ? =95 /19. What's 95 divided by19? Well, 19 times 5 is 95 because 19\u00d75 is 95. So, ? equals 5.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is 5. So that's the answer.\n\n\nTo solve the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5 + ? \\times 19 - 15 - 7}{13 \\times 13 - 156} = 6,\n\\]\n\nwe start by simplifying the denominator:\n\n\\[\n13 \\times 13 - 156 = 169 - 156 = 13.\n\\]\n\nThis reduces the equation to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5 + ? \\times 19 - 15 - 7}{13} = 6.\n\\]\n\nNext, simplify the numerator by combining constants:\n\n\\[\n5 - 15 - 7 = -17.\n\\]\n\nThe equation now becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-17 + ? \\times 19}{13} = 6.\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 13 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n-17 + ? \\times 19 = 78.\n\\]\n\nAdd 17 to both sides to isolate the term with the unknown:\n\n\\[\n? \\times 19 = 95.\n\\]\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 19 to solve for the unknown:\n\n\\[\n? = \\frac{95}{19} = 5.\n\\]\n\nThus, the missing number is **5**, which corresponds to option C.\n\nAnswer: C",

The options are A)4, B)4.5, C)5, D)5.5, E)6.5. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I'll rewrite the equation to make it clearer. So, the numerator is 5 plus the unknown times 19, minus 15, minus 7. The denominator is 13 times 13 minus 156. And all of that equals 6.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n[5 + ? \u00d7 19 - 15 -7] / [13 \u00d713 - 156] = 6.\n\nI think I should start by simplifying both the numerator and the denominator. Let's tackle the denominator first because it might be easier.\n\nThe denominator is 13 \u00d713. I know 13 squared is 169. So 169 minus 156. Let me subtract that. 169 - 156 is... 13? Because 156 +13 is 169. Yeah, so denominator is 13.\n\nSo now the equation becomes [5 + ? \u00d719 -15 -7]/13 = 6.\n\nHmm, now I can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(5 + (unknown)\u00d719 -15 -7) divided by 13 equals 6.\n\nLet me simplify the numerator. Let's combine the constants: 5, minus 15, minus 7. Let's add them up. 5 -15 is -10. Then -10 minus7 is -17. So the numerator becomes (-17 + ? \u00d719) divided by 13 equals 6.\n\nSo, the equation now is ( (-17) + 19\u00d7? ) /13 =6.\n\nI can multiply both sides by 13 to get rid of the denominator. So:\n\n(-17) +19\u00d7? =6 \u00d713.\n\nCalculating 6 times 13: 6*10 is 60, 6*3 is 18, so 60+18=78. So,\n\n-17 +19\u00d7? =78.\n\nNow, I need to solve for ?. Let's add 17 to both sides to isolate the term with ?.\n\n19\u00d7? =78 +17.\n\n78 +17 is 95, right? Because 70+10 is 80, 8+7 is 15, so 80+15=95. So,\n\n19\u00d7? =95.\n\nNow, divide both sides by 19 to solve for ?.\n\n? =95 /19.\n\nWhat's 95 divided by 19? Let me think. 19 times 5 is 95 because 19*5=95. Oh, right! So ? is 5.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is 5. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, did I do everything correctly? Let me double-check.\n\nDenominator: 13\u00d713=169, 169-156=13. Correct.\n\nNumerator: 5 -15= -10, -10-7=-17. So numerator becomes -17 +19\u00d7?. Then equation is (-17 +19?) /13 =6.\n\nMultiply both sides by 13: -17 +19? =78.\n\nAdding 17: 19? =95. Divide by 19: ?=5. Yep, that's right.\n\nSo I think I'm confident that the answer is C)5.\n\n\nTo solve the equation \n\n\\[\n\\frac{5 + ? \\times 19 - 15 - 7}{13 \\times 13 - 156} = 6,\n\\]\n\nwe start by simplifying both the numerator and the denominator.\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the denominator\nThe denominator is \\(13 \\times 13 - 156\\). Calculating \\(13 \\times 13 = 169\\), then subtracting 156 gives:\n\\[\n169 - 156 = 13.\n\\]\nThus, the denominator simplifies to 13.\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the numerator\nThe numerator is \\(5 + ? \\times 19 - 15 - 7\\). Combining the constants:\n\\[\n5 - 15 - 7 = -17.\n\\]\nSo, the numerator becomes:\n\\[\n-17 + 19 \\times ?.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Rewrite the equation\nSubstituting the simplified numerator and denominator, the equation becomes:\n\\[\n\\frac{-17 + 19 \\times ?}{13} = 6.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Solve for ?\nMultiply both sides by 13 to eliminate the denominator:\n\\[\n-17 + 19 \\times ? = 78.\n\\]\nAdd 17 to both sides:\n\\[\n19 \\times ? = 95.\n\\]\nDivide both sides by 19:\n\\[\n? = \\frac{95}{19} = 5.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe missing number is 5, which corresponds to option **C**.\n\nAnswer: C",

Let's do that:\n\n(-17 +19?) =6 \u00d713.\n\nCalculating 6\u00d713, that's 78. So now the equation is -17 +19? =78.\n\nNext, I'll add 17 to both sides to isolate the term with ?. Adding 17 to 78 gives 95. So:\n\n19? =95.\n\nNow, divide both sides by 19 to find ?. 95 divided by 19 is 5 because 19\u00d75=95.\n\nWait, so the missing number is 5. Let me check the options.
