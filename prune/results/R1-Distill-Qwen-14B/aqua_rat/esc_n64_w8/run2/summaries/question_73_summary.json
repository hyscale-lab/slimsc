Wait, rectangles have two pairs of equal sides, right? So the formula for the perimeter must involve adding up all the sides.\n\nI think the formula is something like twice the length plus twice the width. Oh wait, yeah! The formula is P = 2*(length + width). That makes sense because you have two lengths and two widths.\n\nThe problem says the length is 8 centimeters and the width is 3 centimeters.

First, I'll calculate length plus width: 8 + 3 equals 11. Then, multiply that by 2: 11 * 2 is 22. Oh, so the perimeter should be 22 centimeters.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The rectangle has two lengths and two widths. So each pair adds up. So 8 + 8 is 16 for the lengths, and 3 +3 is 6 for the widths. Adding them together gives 16 +6 =22 cm. Yep, that's the same as before. So the perimeter is 22 cm.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 22 cm. So the answer should be B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about finding the perimeter of a rectangle. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the perimeter is the total distance around the shape. Oh right, for a rectangle, the formula is 2 times the length plus 2 times the width. Or wait, sometimes I see it written as 2*(length + width). Either way, it's the same thing.\n\nThe problem says the length is 8 centimeters and the width is 3 centimeters. So plugging those numbers into the formula. Let me do the math step by step.
