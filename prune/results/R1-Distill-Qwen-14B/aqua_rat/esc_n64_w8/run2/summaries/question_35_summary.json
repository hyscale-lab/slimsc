      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a rectangular solid inscribed in a sphere. Hmm, I remember that when a solid is inscribed in a sphere, all its vertices lie on the sphere's surface. The question is asking for the diameter of the sphere. The solid has dimensions 3 x 4 x 15. \n\nWait, I think the key here is that the sphere's diameter would be the space diagonal of the rectangular solid. Because the space diagonal runs from one corner of the solid to the opposite corner, passing through the center of the sphere. So the length of this diagonal should be equal to the sphere's diameter.\n\nRight, so how do I find the space diagonal of a rectangular solid? I recall the formula for the space diagonal (d) of a box with length l, width w, and height h is d = sqrt(l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2). Oh yeah, that makes sense because it's an extension of the Pythagorean theorem into three dimensions.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. The dimensions are 3, 4, and 15. So l is 3, w is 4, h is 15. Let's calculate each squared:\n\n3 squared is 9.\n4 squared is 16.\n15 squared is 225.\n\nAdding those together: 9 + 16 is 25, plus 225 makes 250. So the square of the diagonal is 250. To find the diagonal, I take the square root of 250.\n\nWait, what's the square root of 250? Let me think. I know that 15\u00b2 is 225 and 16\u00b2 is 256. So sqrt(250) is between 15 and 16. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, I can factor 250. 250 is 25 * 10, so sqrt(25*10) = 5*sqrt(10). Oh, right, because sqrt(25) is 5. So sqrt(250) = 5*sqrt(10).\n\nWhat's the approximate value of sqrt(10)? I remember it's about 3.1623. So 5 times 3.1623 is 15.8115. That's the space diagonal, which is the diameter of the sphere.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 15.8113, which is very close. So the diameter is approximately 15.8113.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations. Did I add 9 + 16 + 225 correctly? 9+16 is 25, yes. 25+225 is 250. Yep. So sqrt(250) is definitely the diagonal. And 5 times 3.1623 is about 15.8115. So the closest option is B, which is 15.8113.\n",

I think the formula for the space diagonal (d) of a rectangular solid with sides a, b, c is something like d = sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2). Let me write that down: d = sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2). \n\nSo plugging in the values given: a is 3, b is 4, and c is 15. Let me calculate each squared term. \n\n3 squared is 9, 4 squared is 16, and 15 squared is 225. Adding those together: 9 + 16 is 25, and 25 + 225 is 250. So the sum is 250. \n\nThen the space diagonal is the square root of 250. Hmm, what's sqrt(250)? I know that sqrt(225) is 15, and sqrt(256) is 16. So sqrt(250) should be somewhere between 15 and 16. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nWait, 250 is 25 times 10. So sqrt(25*10) is 5*sqrt(10). Oh right, because sqrt(ab) = sqrt(a)*sqrt(b). So sqrt(250) = 5*sqrt(10). \n\nWhat's the approximate value of sqrt(10)? I remember it's about 3.1623. So 5 * 3.1623 is... let's see, 5 * 3 is 15, and 5 * 0.1623 is about 0.8115. Adding them gives 15.8115. So the space diagonal is approximately 15.8115 units.\n\nWait, but wait, the question asks for the diameter of the sphere. Oh yeah, because the space diagonal is the diameter. So the diameter is approximately 15.8115. Looking at the options, option B is 15.8113. That must be the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculation steps. The sides are 3,4,15. Squares are 9,16,225. Sum is 250. Square root of 250 is indeed sqrt(25*10) =5*sqrt(10), which is about 15.8113. Yep, that's right. So the answer should be option B.\n\n\nTo determine the diameter of the sphere in which a rectangular solid (3 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 15) is inscribed, we calculate the space diagonal of the solid. The space diagonal of a rectangular solid with sides \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given dimensions (\\(a = 3\\), \\(b = 4\\), \\(c = 15\\)):\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{9 + 16 + 225}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{250}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd = 5\\sqrt{10}\n\\]\n\nApproximating \\(\\sqrt{10} \\approx 3.1623\\):\n\n\\[\nd \\approx 5 \\times 3.1623 = 15.8115\n\\]\n\nSince the space diagonal is the diameter of the sphere, the diameter is approximately \\(15.8113\\). Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: B**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. A rectangular solid with dimensions 3 x 4 x 15 is inscribed in a sphere, meaning all eight of its vertices lie on the sphere. I need to find the diameter of the sphere. Hmm, I remember that when a solid is inscribed in a sphere, the sphere's diameter is equal to the solid's space diagonal. Right, because the space diagonal stretches from one corner of the solid to the opposite corner, passing through the center of the sphere, which would be the diameter.\n\nWait, so the formula for the space diagonal of a rectangular solid is derived from the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions. Let me think. The formula is sqrt(length\u00b2 + width\u00b2 + height\u00b2). Oh right, because you first find the diagonal of the base, which is sqrt(l\u00b2 + w\u00b2), and then use that as the base for another right triangle with the height, so the space diagonal is sqrt((sqrt(l\u00b2 + w\u00b2))\u00b2 + h\u00b2) which simplifies to sqrt(l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2).\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers from the problem: the length is 3, width is 4, height is 15. Let's calculate each squared. 3 squared is 9, 4 squared is 16, 15 squared is 225. Adding those together: 9 + 16 is 25, plus 225 makes 250. So the space diagonal is the square root of 250.\n\nWait, what's the square root of 250? Let me think. I know that 15 squared is 225 and 16 squared is 256, so sqrt(250) must be a bit less than 16. Let me calculate it more accurately. 250 is 25*10, so sqrt(25*10) is 5*sqrt(10). Oh wait, wait, no: 250 is 25 times 10, but 25 is 5 squared. So sqrt(250) = sqrt(25 * 10) = 5 * sqrt(10). But wait, wait, sqrt(250) is also sqrt(25*10) = 5*sqrt(10). But wait, that's not right because 25 * 10 is 250, yes. So sqrt(250) is 5 times sqrt(10). Hmm, but wait, I thought sqrt(250) is approximately 15.8113. Let me check. Because sqrt(256) is 16, so sqrt(250) is about 15.8113. Because 15.8113 squared is approximately 250.\n\nSo the space diagonal is approximately 15.8113, which would be the diameter of the sphere. Wait, but wait, the question asks for the diameter, which is the same as the space diagonal. So the answer should be 15.8113, which is option B.\n\nLet me double-check. The formula is correct, right? Space diagonal is sqrt(l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2). So 3\u00b2=9, 4\u00b2=16, 15\u00b2=225. 9+16=25, 25+225=250. sqrt(250)=about 15.8113. Yep, that's correct.\n",
