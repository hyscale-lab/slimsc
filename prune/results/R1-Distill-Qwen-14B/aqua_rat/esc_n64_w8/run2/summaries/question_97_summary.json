      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a wire shaped into a rectangle and then being rebent into a square. Hmm, I remember that when you reshape a wire, the total length of the wire stays the same because it's just bent differently. So the perimeter must be the same in both cases.\n\nThe rectangle has a length of 27 cm and a breadth of 17 cm. Wait, right, the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as 2*(length + breadth). So let me compute that. Length is 27, breadth is 17. So adding those gives 27 +17 =44. Multiply by 2, so 44 *2 = 88 cm. Oh wait, no wait, wait. Wait a second, no, wait. Oh no! Wait, wait. No, the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + width). Oh right, so 27 +17 is 44, times 2 is 88. So the perimeter is 88 cm.\n\nNow, the wire is rebent into a square. So the perimeter of the square must also be 88 cm. Because the wire isn't getting longer or shorter, just changing shape. So the perimeter of the square is 4 times the length of one side, right? So if I let s be the length of a side, then 4*s = 88. To find s, I divide both sides by 4. So 88 divided by 4 is 22. Oh, so each side of the square is 22 cm. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 22. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, just double-checking my calculations.

So the perimeter of the rectangle must be equal to the perimeter of the square.\n\nRight, the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as 2*(length + breadth). So for this rectangle, the length is 27 cm and the breadth is 17 cm. Let me calculate that. \n\nSo, 2*(27 +17). Let me add 27 and 17 first. 27 plus 17 is 44. Multiply by 2 gives 88 cm. So the perimeter of the rectangle is 88 cm.\n\nNow, when the wire is bent into a square, the perimeter of the square will be the same, 88 cm. The perimeter of a square is 4 times the side length. So if I let s be the length of each side of the square, then 4s = 88.\n\nTo find s, I'll divide both sides by 4. 88 divided by 4 is 22. So each side of the square should be 22 cm. Looking at the options, option C is 22. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations. Rectangle perimeter: 2*(27+17) = 2*(44)=88. Square perimeter is 4*s=88 \u2192 s=22. Yep, that's correct. So the correct option is C.\n\n\nThe wire is initially in the shape of a rectangle with a length of 27 cm and a breadth of 17 cm. The perimeter of the rectangle is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter of rectangle} = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{breadth}) = 2 \\times (27 + 17) = 2 \\times 44 = 88 \\, \\text{cm}.\n\\]\n\nWhen the wire is rebent into a square, the perimeter of the square remains the same (88 cm). The perimeter of a square is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter of square} = 4 \\times \\text{side length}.\n\\]\n\nLet \\( s \\) be the side length of the square. Then:\n\n\\[\n4s = 88 \\implies s = \\frac{88}{4} = 22 \\, \\text{cm}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the measure of each side of the square is **22 cm**, which corresponds to option **C**.\n\nAnswer: C",

Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the wire is a rectangle with a length of 27 cm and a breadth of 17 cm. Wait, when they say the wire is in the shape of a rectangle, that means the perimeter of the rectangle is equal to the length of the wire. Oh right, because the wire forms the edges of the rectangle.\n\nSo the first thing I should do is calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2*(length + breadth). Let me plug in the numbers. So that's 2*(27 + 17). Let me calculate that. 27 plus 17 is 44. Multiply by 2 gives 88 cm. So the perimeter is 88 cm.\n\nNow, the wire is rebent into a square. That means the perimeter of the square is the same as the perimeter of the rectangle. Because the wire isn't changing length, just shape. So the perimeter of the square is also 88 cm.\n\nNext, I need to find the length of each side of the square. The formula for the perimeter of a square is P = 4*side. Since all sides are equal, I can rearrange this to find the side length by dividing the perimeter by 4.\n\nSo side = P / 4 = 88 cm / 4. Let me calculate that. 88 divided by 4 is 22. So each side of the square should be 22 cm long.\n\nLooking at the options provided, option C is 22. That must be the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me just double-check my calculations. Rectangle perimeter: 2*(27+17) = 2*44=88 cm. Square perimeter same, so side is 88/4=22. Yep, that all adds up.\n",
