      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about Jerry buying a bond, and I need to figure out how much interest it's accrued at maturity. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, the bond is a 1-year $5,000 bond. The annual interest rate is 12%, and it's compounded every six months. Oh right, compounding means that the interest is calculated and added to the principal more frequently than once a year. So in this case, it's every six months, which is twice a year.\n\nWait, so the interest is compounded semi-annually. That means each six months, the bond earns 6% interest because 12% divided by two is 6%. Because the total rate is 12% per annum, and we're splitting that into two periods.\n\nSo the formula for compound interest is A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt). Let me make sure I remember that correctly. P is the principal amount, r is the annual interest rate (as a decimal), n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years the money is invested for.\n\nIn this case, P is $5,000. The rate r is 12%, so 0.12. n is 2 because it's compounded twice a year. And t is 1 year. So plugging these numbers in.\n\nWait, but the question is about the interest accrued, not the total amount. So I need to calculate the total amount and then subtract the principal to get the interest earned.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the interest directly by using the formula for compound interest. Let's do that.\n\nSo A = 5000 * (1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1). Let me compute the exponent part first. 2 times 1 is 2. So we're raising (1 + 0.06) to the power of 2.\n\nWait, 0.12 divided by 2 is 0.06. So 1 + 0.06 is 1.06. Squared, that would be 1.06 * 1.06. Let me calculate that. 1.06 * 1.06: 1 times 1 is 1, 1 times 0.06 is 0.06, 0.06 times 1 is another 0.06, and 0.06 times 0.06 is 0.0036. Adding them all up: 1 + 0.06 + 0.06 + 0.0036 = 1.1236.\n\nSo A = 5000 * 1.1236. Let's compute that. 5000 * 1.1236. Let me think, 5000 * 1 is 5000, 5000 * 0.12 is 600, 5000 * 0.0036 is 18. So adding those: 5000 + 600 is 5600, plus 18 is 5618. So the total amount A is $5,618.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Because the bond is for 1 year, and it's compounded every six months, there are two compounding periods. So the first six months, the bond earns 6% on $5,000. Then, the next six months, it earns 6% on the new amount.\n\nSo let me compute each step. First six months: interest is 5000 * 0.06 = 300. So the amount after six months is 5000 + 300 = $5,300.\n\nThen, the next six months: 5,300 * 0.06 = 318. So adding that to 5,300 gives 5,618. So the total interest is 300 + 318 = 618. So the interest accrued is $618.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is $618. So that must be the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Another way to compute the interest is to use the formula for compound interest and subtract the principal. So A is 5000 * (1.06)^2 = 5000 * 1.1236 = 5618. Subtract 5000 gives 618. Yep, same as before.\n\nSo the interest is $618, which is option B.\n",

Hmm, right, compounding means that the interest is calculated and added to the principal more than once a year. So in this case, it's every six months, which means twice a year.\n\nWait, so the formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), right? Where:\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- P is the principal amount, which is $5,000 here.\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal), so that's 12% or 0.12.\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year. Since it's every six months, n would be 2.\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years, which is 1 year here.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers: P is 5000, r is 0.12, n is 2, t is 1.\n\nLet me compute that. So the formula becomes A = 5000*(1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1). Let me compute 0.12 divided by 2 first. That's 0.06. So 1 + 0.06 is 1.06. Then, 2*1 is 2, so it's 1.06 squared.\n\nWait, what's 1.06 squared? Let me calculate that. 1.06 * 1.06. Hmm, 1 times 1 is 1, 1 times 0.06 is 0.06, 0.06 times 1 is 0.06, and 0.06 times 0.06 is 0.0036. Adding them all up: 1 + 0.06 + 0.06 + 0.0036 = 1.1236. Oh wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, that's not how you multiply decimals. Let me think again. 1.06 * 1.06 is 1.1236, yes. Because 1.06 * 1.06: 6*6 is 36, 6*0 (from the second 1.06's 1) is 0, 0*6 is 0, and 1*1 is 1. Wait, perhaps I should do it as (1 + 0.06)^2, which is 1 + 2*0.06 + 0.06^2 = 1 + 0.12 + 0.0036 = 1.1236. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo A = 5000 * 1.1236. Let me calculate that. 5000 * 1 is 5000, 5000 * 0.12 is 600, and 5000 * 0.0036 is 18. So adding those together: 5000 + 600 is 5600, plus 18 is 5618.\n\nWait, but the question is about the interest accrued, not the total amount. So the interest is A minus P. So 5618 minus 5000 is 618. So the interest is $618.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 618. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check in case I made a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute the interest step by step. Since it's compounded every six months, the first six months would give interest on $5000. The rate per period is 6% (since 12% annually, divided by 2 periods). So 5000 * 0.06 = 300. So after six months, the amount is 5300.\n\nThen, the next six months, the interest is 6% of 5300. So 5300 * 0.06 = 318. So the total amount after a year is 5300 + 318 = 5618. Again, subtracting the principal, 5618-5000=618. So that's the same result as before.\n\nSo yeah, the correct answer is option B, $618.\n",

I remember that bonds can have different compounding methods, so that's probably important here.\n\nThe bond is a 1-year, $5,000 bond with a 12% annual interest rate, compounded every six months. Wait, so the interest is compounded semi-annually. That means the interest is calculated and added twice a year. Right, because compounding every six months would split the annual rate into two periods.\n\nSo, the annual interest rate is 12%, which is 0.12 as a decimal. Since it's compounded every six months, each compounding period would have half of that rate. So each period's rate would be 6%, or 0.06.\n\nThe formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), but wait, in this case, since it's compounded every six months, n would be 2. But wait, the time here is one year, so t is 1. So n*t is 2*1 = 2 periods.\n\nSo P is the principal, which is $5,000. The interest rate per period is 0.06. So let me plug these into the formula.\n\nA = 5000 * (1 + 0.06)^2.\n\nWait, let me calculate that. 1.06 squared is 1.1236. Multiply that by 5000.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about Jerry buying a bond, and I need to figure out how much interest it has accrued by the time it matures. Hmm, let me see. I remember that bonds can have different compounding methods, so that's probably important here.\n\nThe bond is a 1-year, $5,000 bond with a 12% annual interest rate, compounded every six months. Wait, so the interest is compounded semi-annually. That means the interest is calculated and added twice a year. Right, because compounding every six months would split the annual rate into two periods.\n\nSo, the annual interest rate is 12%, which is 0.12 as a decimal. Since it's compounded every six months, each compounding period would have half of that rate. So each period's rate would be 6%, or 0.06.\n\nThe formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), but wait, in this case, since it's compounded every six months, n would be 2. But wait, the time here is one year, so t is 1. So n*t is 2*1 = 2 periods.\n\nSo P is the principal, which is $5,000. The interest rate per period is 0.06. So let me plug these into the formula.\n\nA = 5000 * (1 + 0.06)^2.\n\nWait, let me calculate that. 1.06 squared is 1.1236. Multiply that by 5000. So 5000 * 1.1236 = let's see, 5000 *1 is 5000, 5000 *0.12 is 600, and 5000*0.0036 is 18. So 5000 + 600 is 5600, plus 18 is 5618. So the total amount at maturity is $5,618.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking how much interest was accrued, not the total amount. So I need to subtract the principal from that amount. 5618 minus 5000 is 618. So the interest is $618.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is $618. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I should compute it another way. Alternatively, each six months, the interest is 6% of the current principal.\n\nFirst six months: 5000 * 0.06 = 300. So after six months, the amount is 5300.\n\nSecond six months: 5300 * 0.06 = 318. So after the second six months, the total is 5300 + 318 = 5618. So the total interest is 300 + 318 = 618. Yep, same as before. So that's correct.\n\nSo the correct answer is B.\n\n\nTo determine the interest accrued on the bond at maturity, we use the compound interest formula:\n\n\\[\nA = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(P = 5000\\) (principal amount),\n- \\(r = 0.12\\) (annual interest rate),\n- \\(n = 2\\) (compounded every six months),\n- \\(t = 1\\) (time in years).\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the amount at maturity\nThe interest rate per compounding period is \\( \\frac{r}{n} = \\frac{0.12}{2} = 0.06 \\).

So, the problem is that Jerry bought a 1-year $5,000 bond with a 12% annual interest rate, compounded every six months. I need to find out how much interest it has accrued at maturity.\n\nHmm, I remember that compound interest means that the interest is calculated and added to the principal multiple times over the investment period. Since it's compounded every six months, that means the interest is added twice a year. So, the formula for compound interest is A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt), where:\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- P is the principal amount ($5,000 here).\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal form, so 12% is 0.12).\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nIn this case, t is 1 year. So plugging the numbers in:\nP = 5000\nr = 0.12\nn = 2 (since it's compounded twice a year)\nt = 1\n\nSo the formula becomes A = 5000 * (1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1)\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the rate per period: 0.12 divided by 2 is 0.06. So each six-month period, the interest rate is 6%.\n\nThen, the exponent is 2*1=2, so we're looking at two compounding periods.\n\nSo, 1 + 0.06 is 1.06. Then, 1.06 squared is... let me think. 1.06 times 1.06 is 1.1236.\n\nThen, A is 5000 multiplied by 1.1236. Let me do that multiplication. 5000 * 1.1236.\n\nWait, 5000 * 1 is 5000, 5000 * 0.12 is 600, 5000 * 0.0036 is 18. So adding those together: 5000 + 600 is 5600, plus 18 is 5618.\n\nWait, but that would be the total amount, right? So the interest accrued is the total amount minus the principal. So 5618 - 5000 = 618.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is $618. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I do that right? Let me double-check the calculation. 1.06 squared is indeed 1.1236, correct. 5000 times that is 5000 * 1.1236. Let me compute that again. 5000 multiplied by 1 is 5000. 5000 times 0.12 is 600. 5000 times 0.0036 is 18. So 5000 + 600 = 5600, plus 18 is 5618. So total is 5618, so interest is 618.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this question about bonds and interest. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the problem is that Jerry bought a 1-year $5,000 bond with a 12% annual interest rate, compounded every six months. I need to find out how much interest it has accrued at maturity.\n\nHmm, I remember that compound interest means that the interest is calculated and added to the principal multiple times over the investment period. Since it's compounded every six months, that means the interest is added twice a year. So, the formula for compound interest is A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt), where:\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- P is the principal amount ($5,000 here).\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal form, so 12% is 0.12).\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nIn this case, t is 1 year. So plugging the numbers in:\nP = 5000\nr = 0.12\nn = 2 (since it's compounded twice a year)\nt = 1\n\nSo the formula becomes A = 5000 * (1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1)\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the rate per period: 0.12 divided by 2 is 0.06. So each six-month period, the interest rate is 6%.\n\nThen, the exponent is 2*1=2, so we're looking at two compounding periods.\n\nSo, 1 + 0.06 is 1.06. Then, 1.06 squared is... let me think. 1.06 times 1.06 is 1.1236.\n\nThen, A is 5000 multiplied by 1.1236. Let me do that multiplication. 5000 * 1.1236.\n\nWait, 5000 * 1 is 5000, 5000 * 0.12 is 600, 5000 * 0.0036 is 18. So adding those together: 5000 + 600 is 5600, plus 18 is 5618.\n\nWait, but that would be the total amount, right? So the interest accrued is the total amount minus the principal. So 5618 - 5000 = 618.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is $618. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I do that right? Let me double-check the calculation. 1.06 squared is indeed 1.1236, correct. 5000 times that is 5000 * 1.1236. Let me compute that again. 5000 multiplied by 1 is 5000. 5000 times 0.12 is 600. 5000 times 0.0036 is 18. So 5000 + 600 = 5600, plus 18 is 5618. So total is 5618, so interest is 618. Yeah, that's right.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B, $618.\n\n\nTo determine the interest accrued on the bond at maturity, we use the compound interest formula:\n\n\\[\nA = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(P = 5000\\) (principal amount),\n- \\(r = 0.12\\) (annual interest rate),\n- \\(n = 2\\) (compounded every six months),\n- \\(t = 1\\) (1-year investment period).\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\nA = 5000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.12}{2}\\right)^{2 \\cdot 1}\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate the interest rate per compounding period:\n\\[\n\\frac{0.12}{2} = 0.06\n\\]\n\nNext, calculate the exponent:\n\\[\n2 \\cdot 1 = 2\n\\]\n\nNow, compute the compound factor:\n\\[\n\\left(1 + 0.06\\right)^2 = 1.06^2 = 1.1236\n\\]\n\nFinally, calculate the total amount:\n\\[\nA = 5000 \\cdot 1.1236 = 5618\n\\]\n\nThe interest accrued is the total amount minus the principal:\n\\[\n5618 - 5000 = 618\n\\]\n\nThus, the interest accrued at maturity is **$618**.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about bonds and interest. Let me try to figure it out. So Jerry bought a 1-year bond with a face value of $5,000, and it has an annual interest rate of 12%, compounded every six months. I need to find out how much interest it's accrued at maturity. Hmm, right, compounded interest. \n\nWait, so the key here is that it's compounded every six months. I remember that when interest is compounded, it's added more frequently, which leads to more interest over time because you earn interest on the interest. So the formula for compound interest is something like A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), right? Where:\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- P is the principal amount, which is the initial amount of money, so here it's $5,000.\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal), so 12% would be 0.12.\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year. Since it's every six months, that's twice a year, so n=2.\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years, which is 1 year here.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers: P is 5000, r is 0.12, n is 2, t is 1. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, the rate per period is r/n, which is 0.12 divided by 2, so that's 0.06. The number of periods is n*t, which is 2*1=2. So the formula becomes A = 5000*(1 + 0.06)^2.\n\nCalculating (1.06)^2: 1.06 * 1.06. Let me compute that. 1 times 1 is 1, 1 times 0.06 is 0.06, 0.06 times 1 is 0.06, and 0.06 times 0.06 is 0.0036. Adding those up: 1 + 0.06 + 0.06 + 0.0036. Wait, no, wait, that's not the right way. Actually, 1.06 squared is 1.1236. Because 1.06 * 1.06: 1*1=1, 1*0.06=0.06, 0.06*1=0.06, 0.06*0.06=0.0036. So adding all those: 1 + 0.06 + 0.06 + 0.0036 = 1.1236. So 1.1236.\n\nSo A is 5000 * 1.1236. Let me compute that. 5000 * 1 is 5000. 5000 * 0.12 is 600. 5000 * 0.0036 is 18. So adding those: 5000 + 600 is 5600, plus 18 is 5618. So the total amount is $5,618.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the interest accrued, not the total amount. So the interest would be the total amount minus the principal. So 5618 - 5000 = 618. So the interest is $618. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is 618. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check. So 5000 * 1.06 squared. 1.06 squared is 1.1236, correct. 5000 * 1.1236 is 5618. So interest is 618. That seems right. \n\nAlternatively, I could compute each compounding period step by step. First six months: 5000 at 6% interest. So 5000 * 0.06 = 300. So after six months, it's 5300. Then, the next six months: 5300 * 0.06. 5300 * 0.06 is 318. So 5300 +318 = 5618. Yep, same result. So the interest is 618, which is option B.\n",
