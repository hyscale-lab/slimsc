I remember that when you add a positive and a negative number, it's like subtracting them, but I need to be careful with the signs.\n\nWait, so +45 is a positive number, and -30 is negative. Adding them together. I think the rule is that if the signs are different, you subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger one and take the sign of the larger. So let's see, the absolute values are 45 and 30. 45 is bigger than 30, so I subtract 30 from 45, which gives me 15. Now, since 45 was positive and it's the larger number, the result should be positive. So the answer should be +15.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 15, so that's probably the correct choice. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the signs. Another way to think about it is on the number line. Starting at +45, if I move back 30 units, I end up at +15. Yep, that makes sense.

I remember that when adding numbers with different signs, it's like subtracting them and then taking the sign of the larger number. Wait, is that right? Let me make sure.\n\nSo, +45 is a positive number, and -30 is negative. When I add them, it's like I'm moving on a number line. Starting at +45, if I subtract 30, where do I end up? Oh right, because adding a negative is the same as subtracting. So 45 plus (-30) is the same as 45 minus 30.\n\nLet me do the subtraction: 45 minus 30. Well, 45 minus 30 is 15. So the result should be positive 15 because 45 is larger than 30. Looking at the options, option D is 15, so that must be the correct answer.\n\nWait, did I do that right? Another way to think about it: absolute values. The absolute value of +45 is 45, and for -30 it's 30. So 45 minus 30 is 15. Since the positive number has a larger absolute value, the result is positive. Yeah, that makes sense. So the answer should be D)15.\n\n\nTo solve the problem of adding +45 and -30, we can approach it by recognizing that adding a negative number is equivalent to subtracting its absolute value. Thus, +45 + (-30) becomes 45 - 30. Performing the subtraction gives 15. Since the positive number has a larger absolute value, the result is positive. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: D",

Oh wait, it's similar to having money. If I have +45 dollars and I owe someone 30 dollars (which is like -30), then I subtract the smaller number from the larger one and keep the sign of the larger one. \n\nWait, so 45 is positive and 30 is the absolute value of the negative. So 45 minus 30 is 15. Since 45 is larger, the result should be positive. So the answer should be +15. Let me look at the options. Option D is 15, so that's probably the right choice.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it: adding a positive and a negative number. The rule is to subtract their absolute values and take the sign of the number with the larger absolute value. So |45| is 45, |-30| is 30. 45 is bigger than 30, so the sign is positive. 45-30 is 15. So yeah, D is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can visualize a number line. Starting at +45 and moving 30 steps to the left (because subtracting 30 is like adding -30). So from 45, subtract 30: 45 -30 is 15. So I end up at +15, which is option D.\n\nI think that's right. The other options don't make sense. Option A is -30, which would be if I subtracted 45 from 30. But I added them. Option B is 30, which is what I'd get if I took the positive and negative as absolute values but didn't consider the sign correctly. Option E is -15, which is negative, but since 45 is larger, the result should be positive.\n",
