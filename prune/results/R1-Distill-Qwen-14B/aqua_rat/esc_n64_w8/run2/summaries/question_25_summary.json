      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about Bill riding his bicycle on a windy day. Hmm, I need to figure out how far he can go in 21 minutes. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the problem states that on a normal day, Bill averages about 15 mph. But on a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. Oh right, so I should subtract 4 from his usual speed. Let me calculate that: 15 minus 4 is 11. So his speed on a windy day is 11 mph.\n\nWait, but the question is about how far he goes in 21 minutes. Oh, right, time is given in minutes, but speed is in hours. So I need to convert the time into hours. 21 minutes... Well, since 60 minutes make an hour, 21 divided by 60 equals... Let me compute that. 21 \u00f7 60 is 0.35 hours. Yeah, because 20 minutes is 1/3 of an hour which is about 0.333, so 21 is a bit more, 0.35 exactly.\n\nNow, the formula I remember for distance is speed multiplied by time. So distance equals speed multiplied by time. So I should take his speed on the windy day, which is 11 mph, and multiply it by 0.35 hours. Let me do that: 11 times 0.35.\n\nHmm, 10 times 0.35 is 3.5, and 1 times 0.35 is 0.35. So adding them together, 3.5 plus 0.35 is 3.85. So the distance is 3.85 miles.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3.85 miles. So that should be the correct answer. But wait, the question says to round to the nearest hundredth. Well, 3.85 is already to the hundredth place, so no change needed.\n\nI think that's it. Let me just double-check my steps. Speed on windy day: 15-4=11. Time in hours: 21/60=0.35. Distance: 11 *0.35=3.85. Yep, that's correct.\n",

Hmm, the question is asking how far he can travel in 21 minutes when it's windy. \n\nWait, Bill usually averages 15 mph on a normal day. But on a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. Oh right, so I should subtract 4 from 15 to find his speed on a windy day. Let me do that: 15 minus 4 is 11 mph. So his speed is 11 mph when it's windy.\n\nNow, he's riding for 21 minutes. Wait, time is given in minutes, but speed is in hours. I remember that to find distance, I need to use the formula: distance = speed \u00d7 time. But the time needs to be in the same units as speed. Since speed is per hour, I should convert 21 minutes into hours.\n\nHow do I do that? Well, 60 minutes make an hour, so 21 minutes is 21 divided by 60 hours. Let me calculate that. 21 \u00f7 60 is 0.35 hours. Wait, no, wait: 21 divided by 60. Let me compute that: 21 \u00f7 60 equals 0.35 hours? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 60 minutes is 1 hour, so 21 minutes is 21/60 hours. Let me compute that. 21 \u00f7 60 is 0.35? No, wait. 60 minutes is 1.0, so 20 minutes is 0.333... So 21 is 0.35. Oh, right, 21 \u00f7 60 = 0.35 hours. Okay.\n\nSo now, distance is speed multiplied by time. His speed is 11 mph, time is 0.35 hours. So 11 * 0.35. Let me calculate that. 11 times 0.3 is 3.3, and 11 times 0.05 is 0.55. Adding them together: 3.3 + 0.55 is 3.85. So the distance is 3.85 miles.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3.85 miles. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nSo speed on a windy day is 15 - 4 = 11 mph. Time is 21 minutes, which is 21/60 = 0.35 hours. Distance is 11 * 0.35. Let me compute 11 * 0.35 again. 10 * 0.35 is 3.5, and 1 * 0.35 is 0.35. So 3.5 + 0.35 = 3.85.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about Bill riding his bicycle on a windy day. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is asking how far he can travel in 21 minutes when it's windy. \n\nWait, Bill usually averages 15 mph on a normal day. But on a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. Oh right, so I should subtract 4 from 15 to find his speed on a windy day. Let me do that: 15 minus 4 is 11 mph. So his speed is 11 mph when it's windy.\n\nNow, he's riding for 21 minutes. Wait, time is given in minutes, but speed is in hours. I remember that to find distance, I need to use the formula: distance = speed \u00d7 time. But the time needs to be in the same units as speed. Since speed is per hour, I should convert 21 minutes into hours.\n\nHow do I do that? Well, 60 minutes make an hour, so 21 minutes is 21 divided by 60 hours. Let me calculate that. 21 \u00f7 60 is 0.35 hours. Wait, no, wait: 21 divided by 60. Let me compute that: 21 \u00f7 60 equals 0.35 hours? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 60 minutes is 1 hour, so 21 minutes is 21/60 hours. Let me compute that. 21 \u00f7 60 is 0.35? No, wait. 60 minutes is 1.0, so 20 minutes is 0.333... So 21 is 0.35. Oh, right, 21 \u00f7 60 = 0.35 hours. Okay.\n\nSo now, distance is speed multiplied by time. His speed is 11 mph, time is 0.35 hours. So 11 * 0.35. Let me calculate that. 11 times 0.3 is 3.3, and 11 times 0.05 is 0.55. Adding them together: 3.3 + 0.55 is 3.85. So the distance is 3.85 miles.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3.85 miles. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nSo speed on a windy day is 15 - 4 = 11 mph. Time is 21 minutes, which is 21/60 = 0.35 hours. Distance is 11 * 0.35. Let me compute 11 * 0.35 again. 10 * 0.35 is 3.5, and 1 * 0.35 is 0.35. So 3.5 + 0.35 = 3.85. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer is D) 3.85 miles.\n\n\nBill's speed on a windy day is reduced by 4 mph from his usual 15 mph, giving him a speed of 11 mph. To calculate the distance he travels in 21 minutes, convert the time to hours:  \n\\[\n21 \\, \\text{minutes} = \\frac{21}{60} \\, \\text{hours} = 0.35 \\, \\text{hours}.\n\\]  \nUsing the formula for distance, \\( \\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} \\):  \n\\[\n\\text{distance} = 11 \\, \\text{mph} \\times 0.35 \\, \\text{hours} = 3.85 \\, \\text{miles}.\n\\]  \nThus, the distance Bill travels on a windy day in 21 minutes is **3.85 miles**.  \n\nAnswer: D",
