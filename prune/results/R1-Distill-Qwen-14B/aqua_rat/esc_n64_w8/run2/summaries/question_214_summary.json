      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a boy climbing stairs. The question is asking how many different ways he can reach the top of a 10-step staircase if he can take either one or two steps each time. The options are from A to E, and I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nHmm, I remember that this is a classic problem in combinatorics. Oh right, it's similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Because each step can be reached either by taking a single step from the previous one or by taking a double step from two before. So the number of ways to get to step n is the sum of the ways to get to step n-1 and step n-2.\n\nLet me think about smaller numbers first to see the pattern. Like, for 1 step, there's only one way: take a single step. So that's 1 way. For 2 steps, the boy can take two single steps or one double step. That's 2 ways. Now for 3 steps: how does that work? Well, he can reach step 3 by either taking a single step from step 2, or a double step from step 1. So the number of ways is the sum of ways for step 2 and step 1. That would be 2 + 1 = 3 ways. \n\nWait, so for each step n, the number of ways is the sum of the two previous steps. That sounds exactly like the Fibonacci sequence. Let me list them out up to 10 to make sure.\n\nLet me write down the sequence starting from step 0, which is the base case. I think step 0 is considered as 1 way, because if you're already at the top, there's one way to do nothing. So:\n\nn | ways\n0 | 1\n1 | 1 (only one step)\n2 | 2 (1+1 or 2)\n3 | 3 (2+1)\n4 | 5 (3+2)\n5 | 8 (5+3)\n6 | 13 (8+5)\n7 | 21 (13+8)\n8 | 34 (21+13)\n9 | 55 (34+21)\n10| 89 (55+34)\n\nWait, so for n=10, it's 89 ways. Looking at the options, option B is 89. So the answer should be B.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Did I count correctly?\n\nWait, for step 0, it's 1 way. Step 1: 1. Step 2: 2. Step 3: 3 (1+2). Step 4: 5 (2+3). Step 5: 8 (3+5). Step 6: 13, step7:21, step8:34, step9:55, step10:89. Yeah, that looks right. So the answer is 89, which is option B.\n",

I need to figure out how many different ways he can reach the top. Hmm, this seems familiar. I think it's a combinatorial problem, maybe something to do with permutations or combinations. Wait, no, perhaps it's a dynamic programming problem or relates to the Fibonacci sequence?\n\nLet me think. If there's only 1 step, the boy can only take one step. So there's 1 way. If there are 2 steps, he could take two single steps or one double step. That's 2 ways. For 3 steps, let's see. He could go 1+1+1, 1+2, or 2+1. That's 3 ways. Oh, I see a pattern here. It looks like each step's number of ways is the sum of the previous two steps. Because for step n, the last step could be a single step from n-1, or a double step from n-2.\n\nSo this is similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Let's check the Fibonacci numbers. The Fibonacci sequence is typically 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc., where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. So for step 1, it's 1 way. Step 2 is 2 ways.

So our problem's number of ways for step n is actually F(n+1), where F is the Fibonacci sequence starting with F(1)=1, F(2)=1.\n\nLet me see: For n=1, the number of ways is 1, which is F(2)=1. For n=2, it's 2, which is F(3)=2. For n=3, 3=F(4)=3. So yes, number of ways is F(n+1).\n\nSo for n=10, the number of ways would be F(11).

Let me think.\n\nWait, I think it's similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Because for each step, the boy can come from either one step before or two steps before. So the total ways to reach step n would be the sum of the ways to reach step n-1 and step n-2.\n\nLet me write that down. Let's denote the number of ways to reach step n as f(n).

Like, maybe it's similar to permutations or combinations, but I'm not exactly sure. Wait, I think this might be related to the Fibonacci sequence. Because for each step, the number of ways to get there depends on the previous steps.\n\nLet me think. For a small number of steps, maybe I can figure it out manually. Like, if there's 1 step, he can only take one step. So that's 1 way. If there's 2 steps, he can take two single steps or one double step. So that's 2 ways. For 3 steps, let's see: he can take a single step to step 1, then from there he can go to step 2 in 2 ways, or he could take a double step from step 1 to step 3. Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of the number of ways to get to step 3.\n\nWait, the number of ways to get to step n is equal to the number of ways to get to step n-1 plus the number of ways to get to step n-2. Because from step n-1, he takes one step, and from n-2, he takes two steps. So it's a recursive problem.\n\nLet me write this down for smaller steps to see the pattern.\n\nn=1: 1 way.\nn=2: 2 ways.\nn=3: ways to n=2 (2) + ways to n=1 (1) = 3.\nn=4: ways to n=3 (3) + ways to n=2 (2) = 5.\nn=5: 5+3=8.\nn=6: 8+5=13.\nn=7: 13+8=21.\nn=8: 21+13=34.\nn=9: 34+21=55.\nn=10: 55+34=89.\n\nWait, so for n=10, it's 89 ways. So looking at the options, B is 89. So the answer should be B.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the pattern. Let me recount:\n\nn=1: 1\nn=2: 2\nn=3: 3 (2+1)\nn=4: 5 (3+2)\nn=5: 8 (5+3)\nn=6: 13 (8+5)\nn=7:21 (13+8)\nn=8:34 (21+13)\nn=9:55 (34+21)\nn=10:89 (55+34)\n\nYep, that's correct.
