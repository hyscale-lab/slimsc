      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about population growth in a place called Boomtown. Hmm, let me read it again. The planners expect a 10% increase each year for the next two years. And if that happens, the population two years from now will be exactly double what it was one year ago. I need to find the percent increase over the last year. The options are A to E, with numbers like 20%, 40%, etc.\n\nWait, let me parse this. So, the future population is compared to the population one year ago. Let me think about the timeline here. Let's say the current time is year 0. Then, one year ago is year -1. The next two years would be year 1 and year 2.\n\nBut the problem says the population two years from now (so year 2) would be double the population of one year ago (year -1). So I need to model the population growth from year -1 to year 2.\n\nWait, but the question is about the percent increase over the last year. The last year would be from year 0 to year 1, perhaps? Or maybe the last year is year -1 to year 0? Hmm, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me re-examine the question.\n\nThe question says, \"the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.\" So two years from now is year 2, and one year ago is year -1. So the population in year 2 is double that of year -1.\n\nBut the problem is about the percent increase over the last year. So I'm a bit stuck on what time frame that refers to. Maybe the last year is the year before the current time. Let's say the current time is now, so the last year would be the previous year, which is year -1 to year 0. So the increase from year -1 to year 0 is the \"last year\" they're asking about.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the last year refers to the year before the two-year projection. Hmm. Maybe I should model the population changes step by step.\n\nLet's define P as the population one year ago (year -1). Then, the current population (year 0) would have been after one year of growth. Wait, but wait, if the growth rate is 10% per year, then each year's population is 1.1 times the previous year.\n\nWait, but the problem says the planners expect a 10% increase per year over the next two years. So the next two years are year 1 and year 2. So the population in year 1 would be P0 * 1.1, where P0 is the current population (year 0). Then year 2 would be P0 * 1.1^2.\n\nBut according to the problem, the population in year 2 is double the population in year -1. So P2 = 2 * P_{-1}.\n\nWait, but P_{-1} is the population one year before now (year 0). So P_{-1} is P0 / 1.1, assuming that the population increased by 10% from P_{-1} to P0.\n\nWait, no. Let's think: from year -1 to year 0, if there was a growth rate of x%, then P0 = P_{-1} * (1 + x/100). But we don't know what that x is. Oh wait, the question is about finding x, the growth rate from year -1 to year 0, which is the \"last year\".\n\nWait, the problem says the city's population is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. So the expected growth is 10% from year 0 to 1, and another 10% from 1 to 2.\n\nBut the population in year 2 is 2 * P_{-1}.\n\nSo let's model this.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nP_{-1} = population one year ago.\n\nP0 = current population = P_{-1} * (1 + x), where x is the growth rate from last year (which we need to find).\n\nThen, the next two years are 10% growth each year.\n\nSo P1 = P0 * 1.1\n\nP2 = P1 * 1.1 = P0 * 1.1^2 = P0 * 1.21\n\nBut according to the problem, P2 = 2 * P_{-1}\n\nSo substituting P0 = P_{-1}*(1+x), we have:\n\nP2 = P_{-1}*(1+x) * 1.21 = 2 * P_{-1}\n\nDivide both sides by P_{-1}:\n\n(1+x) * 1.21 = 2\n\nSo (1+x) = 2 / 1.21\n\nLet me compute 2 / 1.21. Hmm. 1.21 is 121/100, so 2/(121/100) = 200/121 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSo 1 + x = approx 1.65289 \u2192 x \u2248 0.65289, which is about 65.29%. So the growth rate x is approximately 65.29%, which is closest to option D, 65%.\n\nWait, but looking back, the options are A)20%, B)40%, C)50%, D)65%, E)75%.\n\nSo the answer would be D)65%.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the timeline.\n\nWait, P2 is two years from now, which is P0 * (1.1)^2. And that equals 2 * P_{-1}.\n\nAnd P0 is P_{-1} * (1+x), where x is the growth rate from last year (year -1 to year 0). So the setup seems correct.\n\nAnother way: Let me assign variables.\n\nLet\u2019s say P_{-1} is the population one year ago. Then, the current population (year 0) is P0 = P_{-1} * (1 + x).\n\nNext year (year 1): P1 = P0 * 1.1.\n\nYear after that (year 2): P2 = P1 * 1.1 = P0 * 1.21.\n\nBut P2 = 2 * P_{-1}.\n\nSubstitute P0 = P_{-1}*(1+x):\n\nP2 = P_{-1}*(1+x)*1.21 = 2 * P_{-1}.\n\nDivide both sides by P_{-1}:\n\n(1+x)*1.21 = 2 \u2192 1+x = 2 / 1.21 \u2192 1+x \u2248 1.6529 \u2192 x\u22480.6529 or 65.29%.\n\nSo yes, that's correct.

So, the planners expect a 10% increase each year for the next two years. So that's two years from now, right? And when they look at that future population, it's double the population of one year ago. Wait, but I'm not sure what \"one year ago\" refers to. Maybe it refers to the starting point before these two years of growth?\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this with variables. Let me assign some variables to make this clearer.\n\nLet me denote the current population as P. But wait, the problem says that two years from now, the population will be double what it was one year ago.

Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says that two years from now, the population will be double the population of one year ago. So if I let the population one year ago (at time -1) be P, then the current population (time 0) is P plus whatever happened in the last year. But that's not necessarily a 10% increase, because the 10% increase is projected for the next two years. So the last year's growth is what we're trying to find.\n\nWait, maybe I should model it differently. Let me assume that the population one year ago (time -1) is P. Then, the population now (time 0) is P multiplied by (1 + x), where x is the growth rate for last year. The next two years are time +1 and time +2, each with a 10% increase.

So, that would be P*(1 + x)*(1.1)^2 = 2P.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because one year ago, the population was P. Two years from now, it's double that, so 2P.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\nP * (1 + x) * (1.1)^2 = 2P.\n\nI can cancel P from both sides because P is non-zero. So:\n\n(1 + x) * (1.1)^2 = 2.\n\nLet me compute (1.1)^2. 1.1 squared is 1.21.\n\nSo:\n\n(1 + x) * 1.21 = 2.\n\nDivide both sides by 1.21:\n\n1 + x = 2 / 1.21.\n\nLet me calculate 2 divided by 1.21. Hmm, 1.21 times 1.65 is about 2.0015, because 1.21 * 1.65 = (1.2 * 1.65) + (0.01 * 1.65) )= 1.98 + 0.0165 = 1.9965, which is close to 2.

The question is asking for the percent population increase over the last year, and I need to find which option is closest.\n\nWait, I think I should break this down step by step. Let me visualize it. Let's say the current population is P.

Oh, so one year ago, the population was P divided by 1.10, because a year ago, it would have been before the 10% increase.

Let's denote:\n\nP(T) = current population.\n\nThen,\n\nP(T+1) = P(T) * 1.10\n\nP(T+2) = P(T+1) * 1.10 = P(T) * (1.10)^2.\n\nAccording to the problem, P(T+2) = 2 * P(T-1).\n\nBut P(T-1) is the population one year before now, so that's P(T) divided by (1 + growth rate of last year). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, P(T) is the population now. So, if the population increased by some percentage last year, then P(T) = P(T-1) * (1 + x), where x is the growth rate we're trying to find.\n\nSo, P(T-1) = P(T) / (1 + x).\n\nPutting it together, P(T+2) = 2 * P(T-1) = 2 * [P(T)/(1+x)].\n\nBut P(T+2) is also P(T) * (1.1)^2.\n\nSo,\n\nP(T) * (1.1)^2 = 2 * [P(T)/(1+x)]\n\nDivide both sides by P(T):\n\n(1.1)^2 = 2 / (1 + x)\n\nLet me compute (1.1)^2. 1.1 * 1.1 is 1.21.\n\nSo,\n\n1.21 = 2 / (1 + x)\n\nMultiply both sides by (1 + x):\n\n1.21 * (1 + x) = 2\n\nDivide both sides by 1.21:\n\n1 + x = 2 / 1.21\n\nCalculate 2 divided by 1.21.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about population growth in a place called Boomtown. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question says that the population is expected to increase by 10% each year for the next two years. And then, after those two years, the population would be exactly double what it was one year ago. I need to find the percent increase from the last year, and choose the closest option from the given choices.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused about the time frames here. Let me read it again. Oh right, the projection is for the next two years, so that's from now to two years from now. And the population two years from now would be double the population of one year ago. So I think I need to figure out what the population was a year ago, and then see how it's changed over the past year.\n\nLet me set up some variables to make this clearer. Let's let P be the population one year ago. So, right now, the population is P multiplied by 1.10, because it's a 10% increase from last year. Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the current time is now, and the projections are for the next two years. So the population right now is P. Or wait, maybe I should define P as the population one year ago. Let me try that.\n\nLet me define P as the population one year ago. So, that's our starting point. Now, the current population (one year after P) would be P plus 10% of P, which is P * 1.10. Then, in the next year (so two years from now), the population would increase by another 10%, so that would be 1.10 * (current population) = 1.10 * (1.10 * P) = (1.10)^2 * P.\n\nWait, but the problem says that two years from now, the population would be exactly double the population of one year ago. So, two years from now, the population is 2 * P.\n\nWait, because one year ago was P, and two years from now would be P multiplied by (1.10)^2. So:\n\n(1.10)^2 * P = 2 * P.\n\nWait, that can't be right, because (1.1)^2 is 1.21, so 1.21 * P = 2 * P? That would imply 1.21 = 2, which is not possible. So I must have made a mistake in my setup.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the time frames. Let me try to map it out.\n\nLet me think in terms of years. Let me denote:\n\nYear 0: Population is P (the population one year ago).\n\nYear 1: Population is P * 1.10 (current year's population).\n\nYear 2: Population is P * 1.10 * 1.10 = P * 1.21.\n\nBut the problem states that the population two years from now is double the population of one year ago. So, the population in Year 2 is 2 * P.\n\nWait, but according to the projections, Year 2 population is P * (1.1)^2 = 1.21 P. So 1.21 P = 2 P? That can't be correct because 1.21 is not 2. So something's wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the definitions. Let me try another approach. Let me define the current population as P. Then, the population one year ago was P / 1.10, because if it increased by 10% to reach P now.\n\nSo, population one year ago: P_prev = P / 1.10.\n\nThen, the projections say that in two years, the population will be P * (1.10)^2.\n\nThe problem states that this future population (two years from now) is double the population of one year ago. So:\n\nP * (1.10)^2 = 2 * (P_prev) = 2 * (P / 1.10).\n\nSo substituting:\n\nP * 1.21 = 2 * (P / 1.10).\n\nLet me compute the right side: 2 * (P / 1.10) = (2/1.10) * P \u2248 (1.81818) * P.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n1.21 P = 1.81818 P.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 1.21 is less than 1.81818, which would imply P is negative, which doesn't make sense. So I must have messed up the setup.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to re-examine the time frames. Let me try again.\n\nLet me define the current population as P. The population one year ago is P_prev = P / 1.10.\n\nThe projections are that the population will increase by 10% each year for the next two years. So, in one year from now, it will be P * 1.10, and in two years, P * 1.10^2.\n\nThe problem states that the population two years from now will be exactly double the population of one year ago. So:\n\nPopulation in two years = 2 * P_prev.\n\nSo,\n\nP * (1.10)^2 = 2 * (P_prev).\n\nBut P_prev = P / 1.10, so substituting:\n\nP * 1.21 = 2 * (P / 1.10).\n\nLet me compute 2 / 1.10. 2 divided by 1.1 is approximately 1.81818.\n\nSo,\n\n1.21 P = 1.81818 P.\n\nHmm, but this simplifies to 1.21 = 1.81818, which is not correct. So where am I going wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I have the starting point wrong. Maybe the current population isn't P, but the population one year ago is P, and now is P*1.10, then in two years from now, it's P*(1.10)^2.\n\nThe problem says that in two years, the population is double that of one year ago. Wait, but one year ago would be P. So, in two years, it's 2P.\n\nSo:\n\nP*(1.10)^2 = 2 P.\n\nDividing both sides by P:\n\n(1.10)^2 = 2.\n\nBut 1.1 squared is 1.21, which is not equal to 2. So that's impossible. Therefore, my initial setup must be incorrect.\n\nHmm. Maybe the problem is that the population increases by 10% each year for the next two years, but perhaps the 10% is based on the previous year's population. So, perhaps I should model the population as growing by 10% each year.\n\nWait, but regardless, the math leads to 1.21 P = 2 P, which is impossible. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question.\n\nWait, let's read the question again carefully.\n\nThe question states: \"Boomtown urban planners expect the city\u2019s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year?\"\n\nWait, perhaps the \"last year\" refers to the year before the current projection. So, let me think about the timeline.\n\nLet me define the current year as Year 0. The population is P.\n\nUrban planners project a 10% increase each year for the next two years (Year 1 and Year 2).\n\nAfter two years, the population is P * 1.1 * 1.1 = 1.21 P.\n\nThe problem states that this population (1.21 P) is exactly double the population one year ago. Wait, one year ago is Year -1, so the population was P_prev.\n\nSo, 1.21 P = 2 * P_prev.\n\nBut P_prev is the population in Year -1, which is one year before the current Year 0. So, the current population (Year 0) is P = P_prev * 1.10, because it's a 10% increase from P_prev.\n\nSo, P = P_prev * 1.10 \u2192 P_prev = P / 1.10.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\n1.21 P = 2 * (P / 1.10).\n\nLet me compute 2 / 1.10 \u2192 approximately 1.81818.\n\nSo,\n\n1.21 P = 1.81818 P.\n\nSubtracting 1.21 P from both sides:\n\n0 = (1.81818 - 1.21) P \u2192 0.60818 P = 0.\n\nBut that would imply P is zero, which isn't possible. So I must have a wrong setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the population one year ago is not the same as the population in Year -1. Let me reorganize.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet\u2019s say that one year ago (Year -1), the population was P.\n\nIn the current year (Year 0), the population is P * 1.10 (since it's a 10% increase from the previous year).\n\nIn the next two years (Year 1 and Year 2), each year it increases by 10%, so:\n\nYear 1: 1.10 * (Year 0 population) = 1.10 * (1.10 P) = 1.21 P.\n\nYear 2: 1.10 * (Year 1 population) = 1.10 * 1.21 P = 1.331 P.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, after two years, the population is double that of one year ago. So, population in Year 2 is 2 * (Year -1 population) = 2 P.\n\nBut according to the projection, it's 1.331 P.\n\nSo, 1.331 P = 2 P \u2192 which is not possible, because 1.331 is not equal to 2.\n\nSo, this suggests that the initial assumption is incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the 10% increase is not the same each year, but that's not what the problem says. The problem says 10% per year for the next two years.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the time frames. Let me try to model it again.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet\u2019s let P be the population one year ago (Year -1).\n\nCurrent population (Year 0): P * 1.10.\n\nPopulation after one year (Year 1): 1.10 * (Year 0 population) = 1.10 * 1.10 P = 1.21 P.\n\nPopulation after two years (Year 2): 1.10 * (Year 1 population) = 1.10 * 1.21 P = 1.331 P.\n\nThe problem states that the population in Year 2 is double that of one year ago (Year -1). So,\n\n1.331 P = 2 P \u2192 1.331 = 2 \u2192 which is impossible.\n\nSo, perhaps I'm misapplying the time frames. Let me try another approach.\n\nWait, maybe the 'one year ago' refers to before the two-year projection. Let me think: If the current population is P, then one year ago, it was P / 1.10.\n\nThe projection is that in two years, the population will be P * (1.10)^2 = 1.21 P.\n\nThe problem says that 1.21 P = 2 * (P_prev), where P_prev is the population one year ago, which is P / 1.10.\n\nSo, 1.21 P = 2 * (P / 1.10) \u2192 1.21 P = (2 / 1.10) P \u2192 1.21 = 2/1.10.\n\nWait, 2/1.10 is approximately 1.81818. So 1.21 \u2248 1.81818? That's not correct. So something's wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Boomtown urban planners expect the city\u2019s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.\"\n\nWait, so the current time is when they're making the projection. So:\n\nNow: population is P.\n\nAfter one year: P * 1.10.\n\nAfter two years: P * (1.10)^2.\n\nThe problem states that after two years, the population is double that of one year ago.\n\nWait, 'one year ago' from now is P / 1.10. Because the population now is P, which is a 10% increase from one year ago.\n\nSo, the population two years from now is P * (1.10)^2, and this equals 2 * (P / 1.10).\n\nSo,\n\nP * (1.10)^2 = 2 * (P / 1.10).\n\nDividing both sides by P:\n\n(1.10)^2 = 2 / 1.10.\n\nCompute 1.10^2: 1.21.\n\nCompute 2 / 1.10: approximately 1.81818.\n\nSo,\n\n1.21 = 1.81818 \u2192 which is not possible. So I must have an error in my approach.\n\nWait, maybe the 'one year ago' is before the projections started. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me suppose that the current population is P.\n\nUrban planners are projecting a 10% increase each year for the next two years. So, in one year, it's P * 1.10, and in two years, P * 1.21.\n\nThe problem states that in two years, the population will be double the population one year ago. So, two years from now is P * 1.21, and one year ago from now is P / 1.10.\n\nSo,\n\nP * 1.21 = 2 * (P / 1.10).\n\nDivide both sides by P:\n\n1.21 = 2 / 1.10 \u2192 1.21 = 1.81818...\n\nWhich is impossible because 1.21 < 1.818. So, perhaps I'm not interpreting the problem correctly.\n\nWait, maybe the 'one year ago' refers to the year before the two-year projection. Let me try a timeline:\n\nLet me define:\n\nYear 0: one year ago (population P).\n\nYear 1: current year (population P * 1.10).\n\nYear 2: next year (population P * 1.10 * 1.10 = 1.21 P).\n\nYear 3: two years from now (population 1.21 P * 1.10 = 1.331 P).\n\nWait, but the problem says that two years from now (Year 3), the population is double that of one year ago (which would be Year 0). So,\n\n1.331 P = 2 * P.\n\nWhich implies 1.331 = 2 \u2192 which is impossible.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should let the population one year ago be x. Then, the current population is x * 1.10. Then, in two years, it will be x * (1.10)^3, because each year for the next two years, it increases by 10%.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: If current population is x * 1.10, then next year (Year 1) it's x * 1.10 * 1.10, and Year 2 (two years from now) it's x * 1.10^3.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because from current to next year is one year, so two years from now would be current plus two years, which is 1.10^2.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the years. Let me try again.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet x be the population one year ago (Year -1).\n\nCurrent population (Year 0): x * 1.10.\n\nAfter one year (Year 1): x * 1.10 * 1.10 = x * 1.21.\n\nAfter two years (Year 2): x * 1.21 * 1.10 = x * 1.331.\n\nThe problem states that the population after two years is double that of one year ago. So,\n\nx * 1.331 = 2x \u2192 1.331 x = 2x \u2192 1.331 = 2 \u2192 which is impossible.\n\nSo, clearly, I'm making a mistake in setting up the equations. Let me try to approach this differently.\n\nAlternative approach: Let\u2019s define P as the population one year ago. So, P = population in Year -1.\n\nThe current population (Year 0) is P * 1.10.\n\nIn two years (Year 2), the population will be 1.10^2 * P = 1.21 P.\n\nThe problem says that 1.21 P equals twice the population one year ago, which is 2 P.\n\nSo,\n\n1.21 P = 2 P \u2192 1.21 = 2 \u2192 which is impossible.\n\nWait, that can't be. So perhaps the time frame is different. Maybe 'two years from now' is after the next two years, so including the current year.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the current year as the starting point.\n\nCurrent population: P.\n\nOne year ago: P / 1.10.\n\nTwo years from now: P * 1.10^2.\n\nThe problem says that two years from now, the population is double that of one year ago.\n\nSo,\n\nP * 1.10^2 = 2 * (P / 1.10).\n\nSimplify:\n\n1.21 P = (2 / 1.10) P \u2192 1.21 = 2 / 1.10.\n\nCompute 2 / 1.10: 2 \u00f7 1.1 = 1.81818...\n\nSo, 1.21 \u2248 1.81818 \u2192 which is not possible.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider that the 10% is not annual but for the two-year period. No, the problem says 10% per year.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating the growth. Let me compute 1.10 squared.\n\n1.10 * 1.10 = 1.21. Correct.\n\nSo, according to the problem, 1.21 P = 2 P_prev, where P_prev is the population one year ago.\n\nBut P_prev is P / 1.10, so 1.21 P = 2 * (P / 1.10) \u2192 1.21 = 2 / 1.10 \u2192 1.21 = 1.81818. Which is not possible. So maybe I'm misinterpreting the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the projection is for the next two years, but the population one year ago is before those projections. So, perhaps the population one year ago is P, and the projections are for two years from now, which would be P * (1.10)^2. But the problem says that two years from now, the population is double P.\n\nSo,\n\nP * (1.10)^2 = 2 P \u2192 1.21 P = 2 P \u2192 1.21 = 2 \u2192 impossible. So that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the population increase over the last year, not the previous year. So, maybe the current population is P, and the population one year ago was P_prev. Then, the last year's increase would be (P - P_prev)/P_prev * 100%.\n\nBut according to the problem, two years from now, the population is 2 * P_prev.\n\nWait, let me try this setup:\n\nLet me let P_prev be the population one year ago.\n\nCurrent population: P_prev * 1.10 = P.\n\nPopulation two years from now: P * 1.10^2 = 1.21 P.\n\nThe problem states that 1.21 P = 2 * P_prev.\n\nSo,\n\n1.21 P = 2 P_prev \u2192 but P = P_prev * 1.10 \u2192 substituting:\n\n1.21 * 1.10 P_prev = 2 P_prev \u2192 1.331 P_prev = 2 P_prev \u2192 1.331 = 2 \u2192 which is impossible.\n\nI'm really stuck. Maybe I should approach it algebraically.\n\nLet me let x be the population one year ago.\n\nCurrent population is x * 1.10.\n\nAfter two years, population is x * 1.10^3 = x * 1.331.\n\nProblem says that equals 2x.\n\nSo,\n\nx * 1.331 = 2x \u2192 1.331 = 2 \u2192 no.\n\nHmm. Maybe the problem is that the projection is for the next two years, and the population two years from now is double the population one year ago, which is the same as the current year's population.\n\nWait, that's another possibility. Maybe the population two years from now is double the current population.\n\nLet me test that.\n\nCurrent population: P.\n\nAfter two years: P * 1.21.\n\nProblem says 1.21 P = 2 P \u2192 1.21 = 2 \u2192 no.\n\nSo, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the time references.\n\nWait, maybe the 'one year ago' refers to the start of the projection. Let me try again.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet P be the population at the start of the projection (two years ago).\n\nThen, one year ago, the population was P * 1.10.\n\nCurrent population is P * 1.10^2.\n\nAfter two more years (total of four years from P), the population would be P * 1.10^4.\n\nBut the problem says that after the next two years (so from now, two years), the population will be double the population one year ago.\n\nWait, one year ago from now is P * 1.10^2 / 1.10 = P * 1.10.\n\nSo, the population two years from now is P * 1.10^4.\n\nThe problem states that this equals 2 * (P * 1.10).\n\nSo,\n\nP * 1.10^4 = 2 * P * 1.10.\n\nDivide both sides by P * 1.10:\n\n1.10^3 = 2 \u2192 1.331 = 2 \u2192 no.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe I should think in terms of the required growth.\n\nThe problem says that in two years, the population is double the population one year ago. So, the growth factor over two years is 2. But the planners expect a 10% annual growth. So, the growth over two years is (1.10)^2 = 1.21. But the problem says it's 2. So, perhaps the growth is actually higher, and we need to find the implied growth rate.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the projection is 10% per year. So, according to that projection, the growth after two years is 21% (from 1.21). But the problem states that it's double, so 100% increase. So, perhaps the previous growth rates are different.\n\nWait, maybe the 10% is the projected growth for the next two years, and the actual growth over the last year is what we're looking for. Wait, perhaps the current growth is 10% per year for the next two years, but the previous year's growth was higher.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\nLet P be the population one year ago.\n\nCurrent population: P * (1 + r), where r is the growth rate over the last year.\n\nUrban planners project a 10% increase for the next two years. So, next year: (P*(1+r)) * 1.10.\n\nYear after next: (P*(1+r)) * 1.10^2.\n\nThe problem states that two years from now, the population is double that of one year ago. So,\n\n(P*(1+r)) * 1.10^2 = 2 P.\n\nDivide both sides by P:\n\n(1 + r) * (1.10)^2 = 2.\n\nCompute (1.10)^2 = 1.21.\n\nSo,\n\n(1 + r) * 1.21 = 2 \u2192 1 + r = 2 / 1.21 \u2192 2 / 1.21 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSo, 1 + r \u2248 1.65289 \u2192 r \u2248 0.65289, which is approximately 65.289%.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is D) 65%.\n\nSo, the answer should be D) 65%.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about population growth in a place called Boomtown. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question says that the population is expected to increase by 10% each year for the next two years. And then, after those two years, the population would be exactly double what it was one year ago. I need to find the percent increase from the last year, and choose the closest option from the given choices.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused about the time frames here. Let me read it again. Oh right, the projection is for the next two years, so that's from now to two years from now. And the population two years from now would be double the population of one year ago. So I think I need to figure out what the population was a year ago, and then see how it's changed over the past year.\n\nLet me set up some variables to make this clearer. Let's let P be the population one year ago. So, right now, the population is P multiplied by 1.10, because it's a 10% increase from last year. Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the current time is now, and the projections are for the next two years. So the population right now is P. Or wait, maybe I should define P as the population one year ago. Let me try that.\n\nLet me define P as the population one year ago. So, that's our starting point. Now, the current population (one year after P) would be P plus 10% of P, which is P * 1.10. Then, in the next year (so two years from now), the population would increase by another 10%, so that would be 1.10 * (current population) = 1.10 * (1.10 * P) = (1.10)^2 * P.\n\nWait, but the problem says that two years from now, the population would be exactly double the population of one year ago. So, two years from now, the population is 2 * P.\n\nWait, because one year ago was P, and two years from now would be P multiplied by (1.10)^2. So:\n\n(1.10)^2 * P = 2 * P.\n\nWait, that can't be right, because (1.1)^2 is 1.21, so 1.21 * P = 2 * P? That would imply 1.21 = 2, which is not possible. So I must have made a mistake in my setup.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the time frames. Let me try to map it out.\n\nLet me think in terms of years. Let me denote:\n\nYear 0: Population is P (the population one year ago).\n\nYear 1: Population is P * 1.10 (current year's population).\n\nYear 2: Population is P * 1.10 * 1.10 = P * 1.21.\n\nBut the problem states that the population two years from now is double the population of one year ago. So, the population in Year 2 is 2 * P.\n\nWait, but according to the projections, Year 2 population is P * (1.1)^2 = 1.21 P. So 1.21 P = 2 P? That can't be correct because 1.21 is not 2. So something's wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the definitions. Let me try another approach. Let me define the current population as P. Then, the population one year ago was P / 1.10, because if it increased by 10% to reach P now.\n\nSo, population one year ago: P_prev = P / 1.10.\n\nThen, the projections say that in two years, the population will be P * (1.10)^2.\n\nThe problem states that this future population (two years from now) is double the population of one year ago. So:\n\nP * (1.10)^2 = 2 * (P_prev) = 2 * (P / 1.10).\n\nSo substituting:\n\nP * 1.21 = 2 * (P / 1.10).\n\nLet me compute the right side: 2 * (P / 1.10) = (2/1.10) * P \u2248 (1.81818) * P.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n1.21 P = 1.81818 P.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 1.21 is less than 1.81818, which would imply P is negative, which doesn't make sense. So I must have messed up the setup.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to re-examine the time frames. Let me try again.\n\nLet me define the current population as P. The population one year ago is P_prev = P / 1.10.\n\nThe projections are that the population will increase by 10% each year for the next two years. So, in one year from now, it will be P * 1.10, and in two years, P * 1.10^2.\n\nThe problem states that the population two years from now will be exactly double the population of one year ago. So:\n\nPopulation in two years = 2 * P_prev.\n\nSo,\n\nP * (1.10)^2 = 2 * (P_prev).\n\nBut P_prev = P / 1.10, so substituting:\n\nP * 1.21 = 2 * (P / 1.10).\n\nLet me compute 2 / 1.10. 2 divided by 1.1 is approximately 1.81818.\n\nSo,\n\n1.21 P = 1.81818 P.\n\nHmm, but this simplifies to 1.21 = 1.81818, which is not correct. So where am I going wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I have the starting point wrong. Maybe the current population isn't P, but the population one year ago is P, and now is P*1.10, then in two years from now, it's P*(1.10)^2.\n\nThe problem says that in two years, the population is double that of one year ago. Wait, but one year ago would be P. So, in two years, it's 2P.\n\nSo:\n\nP*(1.10)^2 = 2 P.\n\nDividing both sides by P:\n\n(1.10)^2 = 2.\n\nBut 1.1 squared is 1.21, which is not equal to 2. So that's impossible. Therefore, my initial setup must be incorrect.\n\nHmm. Maybe the problem is that the population increases by 10% each year for the next two years, but perhaps the 10% is based on the previous year's population. So, perhaps I should model the population as growing by 10% each year.\n\nWait, but regardless, the math leads to 1.21 P = 2 P, which is impossible. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question.\n\nWait, let's read the question again carefully.\n\nThe question states: \"Boomtown urban planners expect the city\u2019s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year?\"\n\nWait, perhaps the \"last year\" refers to the year before the current projection. So, let me think about the timeline.\n\nLet me define the current year as Year 0. The population is P.\n\nUrban planners project a 10% increase each year for the next two years (Year 1 and Year 2).\n\nAfter two years, the population is P * 1.1 * 1.1 = 1.21 P.\n\nThe problem states that this population (1.21 P) is exactly double the population one year ago. Wait, one year ago is Year -1, so the population was P_prev.\n\nSo, 1.21 P = 2 * P_prev.\n\nBut P_prev is the population in Year -1, which is one year before the current Year 0. So, the current population (Year 0) is P = P_prev * 1.10, because it's a 10% increase from P_prev.\n\nSo, P = P_prev * 1.10 \u2192 P_prev = P / 1.10.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\n1.21 P = 2 * (P / 1.10).\n\nLet me compute 2 / 1.10 \u2192 approximately 1.81818.\n\nSo,\n\n1.21 P = 1.81818 P.\n\nSubtracting 1.21 P from both sides:\n\n0 = (1.81818 - 1.21) P \u2192 0.60818 P = 0.\n\nBut that would imply P is zero, which isn't possible. So I must have a wrong setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the population one year ago is not the same as the population in Year -1. Let me reorganize.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet\u2019s say that one year ago (Year -1), the population was P.\n\nIn the current year (Year 0), the population is P * 1.10 (since it's a 10% increase from the previous year).\n\nIn the next two years (Year 1 and Year 2), each year it increases by 10%, so:\n\nYear 1: 1.10 * (Year 0 population) = 1.10 * (1.10 P) = 1.21 P.\n\nYear 2: 1.10 * (Year 1 population) = 1.10 * 1.21 P = 1.331 P.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, after two years, the population is double that of one year ago. So, population in Year 2 is 2 * (Year -1 population) = 2 P.\n\nBut according to the projection, it's 1.331 P.\n\nSo, 1.331 P = 2 P \u2192 which is not possible, because 1.331 is not equal to 2.\n\nSo, this suggests that the initial assumption is incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the 10% increase is not the same each year, but that's not what the problem says. The problem says 10% per year for the next two years.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the time frames. Let me try to model it again.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet\u2019s let P be the population one year ago (Year -1).\n\nCurrent population (Year 0): P * 1.10.\n\nPopulation after one year (Year 1): 1.10 * (Year 0 population) = 1.10 * 1.10 P = 1.21 P.\n\nPopulation after two years (Year 2): 1.10 * (Year 1 population) = 1.10 * 1.21 P = 1.331 P.\n\nThe problem states that the population in Year 2 is double that of one year ago (Year -1). So,\n\n1.331 P = 2 P \u2192 1.331 = 2 \u2192 which is impossible.\n\nSo, perhaps I'm misapplying the time frames. Let me try another approach.\n\nWait, maybe the 'one year ago' refers to before the two-year projection. Let me think: If the current population is P, then one year ago, it was P / 1.10.\n\nThe projection is that in two years, the population will be P * (1.10)^2 = 1.21 P.\n\nThe problem says that 1.21 P = 2 * (P_prev), where P_prev is the population one year ago, which is P / 1.10.\n\nSo, 1.21 P = 2 * (P / 1.10) \u2192 1.21 P = (2 / 1.10) P \u2192 1.21 = 2/1.10.\n\nWait, 2/1.10 is approximately 1.81818. So 1.21 \u2248 1.81818? That's not correct. So something's wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Boomtown urban planners expect the city\u2019s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.\"\n\nWait, so the current time is when they're making the projection. So:\n\nNow: population is P.\n\nAfter one year: P * 1.10.\n\nAfter two years: P * (1.10)^2.\n\nThe problem states that after two years, the population is double that of one year ago.\n\nWait, 'one year ago' from now is P / 1.10. Because the population now is P, which is a 10% increase from one year ago.\n\nSo, the population two years from now is P * (1.10)^2, and this equals 2 * (P / 1.10).\n\nSo,\n\nP * (1.10)^2 = 2 * (P / 1.10).\n\nDividing both sides by P:\n\n(1.10)^2 = 2 / 1.10.\n\nCompute 1.10^2: 1.21.\n\nCompute 2 / 1.10: approximately 1.81818.\n\nSo,\n\n1.21 = 1.81818 \u2192 which is not possible. So I must have an error in my approach.\n\nWait, maybe the 'one year ago' is before the projections started. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me suppose that the current population is P.\n\nUrban planners are projecting a 10% increase each year for the next two years. So, in one year, it's P * 1.10, and in two years, P * 1.21.\n\nThe problem states that in two years, the population will be double the population one year ago. So, two years from now is P * 1.21, and one year ago from now is P / 1.10.\n\nSo,\n\nP * 1.21 = 2 * (P / 1.10).\n\nDivide both sides by P:\n\n1.21 = 2 / 1.10 \u2192 1.21 = 1.81818...\n\nWhich is impossible because 1.21 < 1.818. So, perhaps I'm not interpreting the problem correctly.\n\nWait, maybe the 'one year ago' refers to the year before the two-year projection. Let me try a timeline:\n\nLet me define:\n\nYear 0: one year ago (population P).\n\nYear 1: current year (population P * 1.10).\n\nYear 2: next year (population P * 1.10 * 1.10 = 1.21 P).\n\nYear 3: two years from now (population 1.21 P * 1.10 = 1.331 P).\n\nWait, but the problem says that two years from now (Year 3), the population is double that of one year ago (which would be Year 0). So,\n\n1.331 P = 2 * P.\n\nWhich implies 1.331 = 2 \u2192 which is impossible.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should let the population one year ago be x. Then, the current population is x * 1.10. Then, in two years, it will be x * (1.10)^3, because each year for the next two years, it increases by 10%.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: If current population is x * 1.10, then next year (Year 1) it's x * 1.10 * 1.10, and Year 2 (two years from now) it's x * 1.10^3.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because from current to next year is one year, so two years from now would be current plus two years, which is 1.10^2.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the years. Let me try again.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet x be the population one year ago (Year -1).\n\nCurrent population (Year 0): x * 1.10.\n\nAfter one year (Year 1): x * 1.10 * 1.10 = x * 1.21.\n\nAfter two years (Year 2): x * 1.21 * 1.10 = x * 1.331.\n\nThe problem states that the population after two years is double that of one year ago. So,\n\nx * 1.331 = 2x \u2192 1.331 x = 2x \u2192 1.331 = 2 \u2192 which is impossible.\n\nSo, clearly, I'm making a mistake in setting up the equations. Let me try to approach this differently.\n\nAlternative approach: Let\u2019s define P as the population one year ago. So, P = population in Year -1.\n\nThe current population (Year 0) is P * 1.10.\n\nIn two years (Year 2), the population will be 1.10^2 * P = 1.21 P.\n\nThe problem says that 1.21 P equals twice the population one year ago, which is 2 P.\n\nSo,\n\n1.21 P = 2 P \u2192 1.21 = 2 \u2192 which is impossible.\n\nWait, that can't be. So perhaps the time frame is different. Maybe 'two years from now' is after the next two years, so including the current year.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the current year as the starting point.\n\nCurrent population: P.\n\nOne year ago: P / 1.10.\n\nTwo years from now: P * 1.10^2.\n\nThe problem says that two years from now, the population is double that of one year ago.\n\nSo,\n\nP * 1.10^2 = 2 * (P / 1.10).\n\nSimplify:\n\n1.21 P = (2 / 1.10) P \u2192 1.21 = 2 / 1.10.\n\nCompute 2 / 1.10: 2 \u00f7 1.1 = 1.81818...\n\nSo, 1.21 \u2248 1.81818 \u2192 which is not possible.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider that the 10% is not annual but for the two-year period. No, the problem says 10% per year.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating the growth. Let me compute 1.10 squared.\n\n1.10 * 1.10 = 1.21. Correct.\n\nSo, according to the problem, 1.21 P = 2 P_prev, where P_prev is the population one year ago.\n\nBut P_prev is P / 1.10, so 1.21 P = 2 * (P / 1.10) \u2192 1.21 = 2 / 1.10 \u2192 1.21 = 1.81818. Which is not possible. So maybe I'm misinterpreting the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the projection is for the next two years, but the population one year ago is before those projections. So, perhaps the population one year ago is P, and the projections are for two years from now, which would be P * (1.10)^2. But the problem says that two years from now, the population is double P.\n\nSo,\n\nP * (1.10)^2 = 2 P \u2192 1.21 P = 2 P \u2192 1.21 = 2 \u2192 impossible. So that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the population increase over the last year, not the previous year. So, maybe the current population is P, and the population one year ago was P_prev. Then, the last year's increase would be (P - P_prev)/P_prev * 100%.\n\nBut according to the problem, two years from now, the population is 2 * P_prev.\n\nWait, let me try this setup:\n\nLet me let P_prev be the population one year ago.\n\nCurrent population: P_prev * 1.10 = P.\n\nPopulation two years from now: P * 1.10^2 = 1.21 P.\n\nThe problem states that 1.21 P = 2 * P_prev.\n\nSo,\n\n1.21 P = 2 P_prev \u2192 but P = P_prev * 1.10 \u2192 substituting:\n\n1.21 * 1.10 P_prev = 2 P_prev \u2192 1.331 P_prev = 2 P_prev \u2192 1.331 = 2 \u2192 which is impossible.\n\nI'm really stuck. Maybe I should approach it algebraically.\n\nLet me let x be the population one year ago.\n\nCurrent population is x * 1.10.\n\nAfter two years, population is x * 1.10^3 = x * 1.331.\n\nProblem says that equals 2x.\n\nSo,\n\nx * 1.331 = 2x \u2192 1.331 = 2 \u2192 no.\n\nHmm. Maybe the problem is that the projection is for the next two years, and the population two years from now is double the population one year ago, which is the same as the current year's population.\n\nWait, that's another possibility. Maybe the population two years from now is double the current population.\n\nLet me test that.\n\nCurrent population: P.\n\nAfter two years: P * 1.21.\n\nProblem says 1.21 P = 2 P \u2192 1.21 = 2 \u2192 no.\n\nSo, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the time references.\n\nWait, maybe the 'one year ago' refers to the start of the projection. Let me try again.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet P be the population at the start of the projection (two years ago).\n\nThen, one year ago, the population was P * 1.10.\n\nCurrent population is P * 1.10^2.\n\nAfter two more years (total of four years from P), the population would be P * 1.10^4.\n\nBut the problem says that after the next two years (so from now, two years), the population will be double the population one year ago.\n\nWait, one year ago from now is P * 1.10^2 / 1.10 = P * 1.10.\n\nSo, the population two years from now is P * 1.10^4.\n\nThe problem states that this equals 2 * (P * 1.10).\n\nSo,\n\nP * 1.10^4 = 2 * P * 1.10.\n\nDivide both sides by P * 1.10:\n\n1.10^3 = 2 \u2192 1.331 = 2 \u2192 no.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe I should think in terms of the required growth.\n\nThe problem says that in two years, the population is double the population one year ago. So, the growth factor over two years is 2. But the planners expect a 10% annual growth. So, the growth over two years is (1.10)^2 = 1.21. But the problem says it's 2. So, perhaps the growth is actually higher, and we need to find the implied growth rate.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the projection is 10% per year. So, according to that projection, the growth after two years is 21% (from 1.21). But the problem states that it's double, so 100% increase. So, perhaps the previous growth rates are different.\n\nWait, maybe the 10% is the projected growth for the next two years, and the actual growth over the last year is what we're looking for. Wait, perhaps the current growth is 10% per year for the next two years, but the previous year's growth was higher.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\nLet P be the population one year ago.\n\nCurrent population: P * (1 + r), where r is the growth rate over the last year.\n\nUrban planners project a 10% increase for the next two years. So, next year: (P*(1+r)) * 1.10.\n\nYear after next: (P*(1+r)) * 1.10^2.\n\nThe problem states that two years from now, the population is double that of one year ago. So,\n\n(P*(1+r)) * 1.10^2 = 2 P.\n\nDivide both sides by P:\n\n(1 + r) * (1.10)^2 = 2.\n\nCompute (1.10)^2 = 1.21.\n\nSo,\n\n(1 + r) * 1.21 = 2 \u2192 1 + r = 2 / 1.21 \u2192 2 / 1.21 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSo, 1 + r \u2248 1.65289 \u2192 r \u2248 0.65289, which is approximately 65.289%.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is D) 65%.\n\nSo, the answer should be D) 65%.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the population growth in Boomtown over time. Let \\( P \\) represent the population one year ago. The current population is then \\( P \\times 1.10 \\), as it has increased by 10% from the previous year. Over the next two years, the population is projected to grow by 10% each year, so the population two years from now will be:\n\n\\[\nP \\times 1.10 \\times 1.10 = P \\times (1.10)^2 = P \\times 1.21\n\\]\n\nThe problem states that the population two years from now will be exactly double the population one year ago. Therefore:\n\n\\[\nP \\times 1.21 = 2P\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\( P \\), we find:\n\n\\[\n1.21 = 2\n\\]\n\nThis equation is not possible, indicating that the growth rate over the last year must have been different to satisfy the condition. Let \\( r \\) represent the growth rate over the last year. The population one year ago was \\( P \\), and the current population is:\n\n\\[\nP \\times (1 + r)\n\\]\n\nWith the projected 10% growth for the next two years, the population two years from now will be:\n\n\\[\nP \\times (1 + r) \\times (1.10)^2\n\\]\n\nThe problem states that this equals double the population one year ago:\n\n\\[\nP \\times (1 + r) \\times (1.10)^2 = 2P\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\( P \\):\n\n\\[\n(1 + r) \\times (1.10)^2 = 2\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( (1.10)^2 = 1.21 \\):\n\n\\[\n(1 + r) \\times 1.21 = 2\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( 1 + r \\):\n\n\\[\n1 + r = \\frac{2}{1.21} \\approx 1.65289\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\nr \\approx 1.65289 - 1 = 0.65289\n\\]\n\nConverting to a percentage:\n\n\\[\nr \\approx 65.289\\%\n\\]\n\nThe closest option to this value is **65%**. Therefore, the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year is approximately 65%.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about population growth in a place called Boomtown. Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on exponential growth, but I'll think it through.\n\nThe question says that the population is expected to increase by 10% each year for the next two years. So, if I let the current population be some number, say P, then next year it'll be P plus 10% of P, which is 1.1 * P. The year after that, it'll increase another 10%, so that would be 1.1 * (1.1 * P) = 1.21 * P. So after two years, the population would be 1.21 times what it is now.\n\nWait, but the problem says that two years from now, the population would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Oh, wait, one year ago from when? Hmm, I think the current time is the starting point. So, let me clarify the timeline.\n\nLet me define the current population as P. The next year (Year 1), it becomes 1.1P. Then, the following year (Year 2), it becomes 1.1 * 1.1P = 1.21P. So two years from now, the population is 1.21P.\n\nBut the problem says that two years from now, the population is exactly double the population of one year ago. Wait, one year ago from when? I think the 'now' is the current time. So one year ago from now would be the population before the current year's growth. So, one year ago, the population was P / 1.1, because now it's P, which is after a 10% increase from last year.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of specific years. Let me set up a timeline.\n\nLet's say the current year is Year 0, population P0 = P.\n\nAfter one year (Year 1), population is P1 = P0 * 1.1 = 1.1P.\n\nAfter two years (Year 2), population is P2 = P1 * 1.1 = 1.21P.\n\nThe problem states that P2 is double the population of one year ago. Wait, one year ago from when? If P2 is the population two years from now, then one year ago from P2 would be P1. Because two years from now is the future, and one year before that would be the previous year.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The way the problem is phrased: \"the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.\" So, two years from now is P2. One year ago is from the current time, which is P0.\n\nWait, no, maybe not. Wait, the wording says \"two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.\" So, perhaps \"one year ago\" refers to one year before the current time, which is when we're making the projection.\n\nWait, perhaps I should rephrase the problem statement to clarify. Let me read it again: \"Boomtown urban planners expect the city\u2019s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year?\"\n\nHmm. So, the projection is that over the next two years, the population increases by 10% each year. So, next year (Year 1) it's 1.1P, then Year 2 it's 1.21P. So two years from now (Year 2) is 1.21P.\n\nThe problem states that this P2 is exactly double the population of one year ago. Wait, but one year ago from when? If the projection is made now, then one year ago is the population last year (Year 0), which is P. So, P2 = 2 * P.\n\nWait, that can't be right because P2 is 1.21P. So 1.21P = 2P? That would imply 1.21 = 2, which isn't possible. So maybe I'm interpreting the timeline wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Let me assign variables to the different years.\n\nLet's say:\n\n- Current year is Year 0: population P0.\n\n- Next year is Year 1: population P1 = P0 * 1.1.\n\n- The year after that is Year 2: population P2 = P1 * 1.1 = P0 * 1.21.\n\nThe problem says that P2 (two years from now) is exactly double the population of one year ago. Wait, one year ago from when? From the current time (Year 0), one year ago would be Year -1. But we don't have data on Year -1. Alternatively, perhaps \"one year ago\" refers to one year before the projection period.\n\nWait, perhaps the statement is that two years from now (Year 2), the population is double that of one year before the projection started. Hmm, that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to one year ago from Year 2, which would be Year 1. So P2 = 2 * P1.\n\nLet me see:\n\nP2 = 1.21 P0.\n\nP1 = 1.1 P0.\n\nIf P2 = 2 * P1, then 1.21 P0 = 2 * 1.1 P0.\n\nSimplify: 1.21 P0 = 2.2 P0.\n\nDivide both sides by P0: 1.21 = 2.2.\n\nBut 1.21 is not equal to 2.2. So that can't be right. Hmm, this suggests that my initial assumption is incorrect. So perhaps the one year ago is from the current time, which is Year 0. So one year ago would be Year -1, but we don't have data on that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the problem. Let me think of the population two years from now (Year 2) being double the population one year before that. So one year before Year 2 is Year 1. So P2 = 2 * P1.\n\nBut from earlier, P2 is 1.21 P0, and P1 is 1.1 P0.\n\nSo:\n\n1.21 P0 = 2 * 1.1 P0 \u2192 1.21 = 2.2 \u2192 which is not true.\n\nHmm, so maybe my initial approach is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to the population one year ago from the current time (Year 0) as P_prev. So, P_prev is the population in Year -1.\n\nBut if that's the case, then P2 = 2 * P_prev.\n\nBut since the planners are expecting a 10% increase each of the next two years, from Year 0 to Year 1 to Year 2. So:\n\nP0 is the current population.\n\nP1 = 1.1 P0.\n\nP2 = 1.1 P1 = 1.21 P0.\n\nThe problem says P2 = 2 * P_prev.\n\nBut P_prev is the population one year before the current time, which is P_prev = P0 / 1.1 (because the population increased by 10% to reach P0 from P_prev).\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nP2 = 2 * P_prev \u2192 1.21 P0 = 2 * (P0 / 1.1).\n\nLet me compute the right side: 2 * (P0 / 1.1) = (2/1.1) P0 \u2248 1.818 P0.\n\nSo, 1.21 P0 = 1.818 P0? That's not possible. So that suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is saying that the population two years from now is double the population of one year ago from two years from now. That is, one year before P2 would be P1. So P2 = 2 * P1.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers:\n\nP2 = 1.21 P0.\n\nP1 = 1.1 P0.\n\nSo 1.21 P0 = 2 * (1.1 P0) \u2192 1.21 = 2.2 \u2192 which is not correct. So this approach isn't working. Maybe I'm missing something in the problem setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the next two years, but that the projection is for the next two years, and the statement is about the population two years from now relative to one year ago from when? Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Boomtown urban planners expect the city\u2019s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year?\"\n\nWait, so the \"last year\" refers to the year before the current time, i.e., the population increase from one year ago to now.\n\nWait, but the question is asking about the percent increase over the last year. So if the current population is P, then one year ago it was P_prev, and the increase is (P - P_prev)/P_prev *100%.\n\nSo the problem is telling us that the projection is 10% increase each year for the next two years, and under this projection, P2 = 2 * P_prev, where P_prev is one year ago from now.\n\nWait, let me set up the variables again.\n\nLet me let P_prev be the population one year ago (Year -1), and P0 is the current population (Year 0).\n\nSo, P0 = P_prev * 1.1 (because it increased by 10% from Year -1 to Year 0).\n\nThen, the projection is for the next two years: P1 = P0 *1.1, and P2 = P1 *1.1 = P0 *1.21.\n\nThe problem states that P2 = 2 * P_prev.\n\nSo substituting:\n\nP2 = P0 *1.21 = 2 * P_prev.\n\nBut P0 = P_prev *1.1 \u2192 substitute P_prev = P0 /1.1.\n\nSo,\n\nP0 *1.21 = 2 * (P0 /1.1).\n\nDivide both sides by P0:\n\n1.21 = 2 / 1.1 \u2192 compute 2/1.1 \u2192 approximately 1.818.\n\nSo, 1.21 \u2248 1.818? That's not correct. So something's wrong here.\n\nHmm. Maybe I misinterpreted the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nWait, the problem says that two years from now, the population is double the population of one year ago. Wait, perhaps \"one year ago\" is not from the current time but from the time of the projection.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the projection being made at a certain time. Let me try to model this.\n\nSuppose the current time is Year 0, and the population is P0.\n\nThe planners project that for the next two years (Year 1 and Year 2), the population will increase by 10% each year.\n\nSo:\n\nYear 1: P1 = 1.1 * P0.\n\nYear 2: P2 = 1.1 * P1 = 1.21 P0.\n\nThe problem states that if this projection holds, then P2 (two years from now) is double the population of one year ago. Wait, one year ago from when? From the current time (Year 0), one year ago is Year -1. But perhaps the projection is made from Year 1, and one year ago from that point is Year 0.\n\nWait, maybe the projection is made at Year 1. So, the projection is for the next two years, which would be Year 2 and Year 3.\n\nWait, that might complicate things. Let me try that approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's say the projection is made at Year 0. The next two years are Year 1 and Year 2.\n\nIn that case, the population two years from now is Year 2: P2 = 1.21 P0.\n\nThe population one year ago from the projection's current time (Year 0) is Year -1: P_{-1}.\n\nBut we don't know P_{-1}. However, the problem says that P2 = 2 * P_{-1}.\n\nBut we also know that from Year -1 to Year 0, the population increased by some rate. Let me call that rate r.\n\nSo, P0 = P_{-1} * (1 + r).\n\nWe have P2 = 1.21 P0 = 2 P_{-1}.\n\nSubstituting P_{-1} = P0 / (1 + r) into the equation:\n\n1.21 P0 = 2 * (P0 / (1 + r)).\n\nDivide both sides by P0:\n\n1.21 = 2 / (1 + r).\n\nMultiply both sides by (1 + r):\n\n1.21 (1 + r) = 2.\n\nDivide both sides by 1.21:\n\n1 + r = 2 / 1.21 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSo, r \u2248 1.65289 - 1 = 0.65289, or about 65.289%.\n\nSo the population increased by approximately 65.289% over the last year (from Year -1 to Year 0).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about population growth in a place called Boomtown. Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on exponential growth, but I'll think it through.\n\nThe question says that the population is expected to increase by 10% each year for the next two years. So, if I let the current population be some number, say P, then next year it'll be P plus 10% of P, which is 1.1 * P. The year after that, it'll increase another 10%, so that would be 1.1 * (1.1 * P) = 1.21 * P. So after two years, the population would be 1.21 times what it is now.\n\nWait, but the problem says that two years from now, the population would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Oh, wait, one year ago from when? Hmm, I think the current time is the starting point. So, let me clarify the timeline.\n\nLet me define the current population as P. The next year (Year 1), it becomes 1.1P. Then, the following year (Year 2), it becomes 1.1 * 1.1P = 1.21P. So two years from now, the population is 1.21P.\n\nBut the problem says that two years from now, the population is exactly double the population of one year ago. Wait, one year ago from when? I think the 'now' is the current time. So one year ago from now would be the population before the current year's growth. So, one year ago, the population was P / 1.1, because now it's P, which is after a 10% increase from last year.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of specific years. Let me set up a timeline.\n\nLet's say the current year is Year 0, population P0 = P.\n\nAfter one year (Year 1), population is P1 = P0 * 1.1 = 1.1P.\n\nAfter two years (Year 2), population is P2 = P1 * 1.1 = 1.21P.\n\nThe problem states that P2 is double the population of one year ago. Wait, one year ago from when? If P2 is the population two years from now, then one year ago from P2 would be P1. Because two years from now is the future, and one year before that would be the previous year.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The way the problem is phrased: \"the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.\" So, two years from now is P2. One year ago is from the current time, which is P0.\n\nWait, no, maybe not. Wait, the wording says \"two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.\" So, perhaps \"one year ago\" refers to one year before the current time, which is when we're making the projection.\n\nWait, perhaps I should rephrase the problem statement to clarify. Let me read it again: \"Boomtown urban planners expect the city\u2019s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year?\"\n\nHmm. So, the projection is that over the next two years, the population increases by 10% each year. So, next year (Year 1) it's 1.1P, then Year 2 it's 1.21P. So two years from now (Year 2) is 1.21P.\n\nThe problem states that this P2 is exactly double the population of one year ago. Wait, but one year ago from when? If the projection is made now, then one year ago is the population last year (Year 0), which is P. So, P2 = 2 * P.\n\nWait, that can't be right because P2 is 1.21P. So 1.21P = 2P? That would imply 1.21 = 2, which isn't possible. So maybe I'm interpreting the timeline wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Let me assign variables to the different years.\n\nLet's say:\n\n- Current year is Year 0: population P0.\n\n- Next year is Year 1: population P1 = P0 * 1.1.\n\n- The year after that is Year 2: population P2 = P1 * 1.1 = P0 * 1.21.\n\nThe problem says that P2 (two years from now) is exactly double the population of one year ago. Wait, one year ago from when? From the current time (Year 0), one year ago would be Year -1. But we don't have data on Year -1. Alternatively, perhaps \"one year ago\" refers to one year before the projection period.\n\nWait, perhaps the statement is that two years from now (Year 2), the population is double that of one year before the projection started. Hmm, that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to one year ago from Year 2, which would be Year 1. So P2 = 2 * P1.\n\nLet me see:\n\nP2 = 1.21 P0.\n\nP1 = 1.1 P0.\n\nIf P2 = 2 * P1, then 1.21 P0 = 2 * 1.1 P0.\n\nSimplify: 1.21 P0 = 2.2 P0.\n\nDivide both sides by P0: 1.21 = 2.2.\n\nBut 1.21 is not equal to 2.2. So that can't be right. Hmm, this suggests that my initial assumption is incorrect. So perhaps the one year ago is from the current time, which is Year 0. So one year ago would be Year -1, but we don't have data on that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the problem. Let me think of the population two years from now (Year 2) being double the population one year before that. So one year before Year 2 is Year 1. So P2 = 2 * P1.\n\nBut from earlier, P2 is 1.21 P0, and P1 is 1.1 P0.\n\nSo:\n\n1.21 P0 = 2 * 1.1 P0 \u2192 1.21 = 2.2 \u2192 which is not true.\n\nHmm, so maybe my initial approach is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to the population one year ago from the current time (Year 0) as P_prev. So, P_prev is the population in Year -1.\n\nBut if that's the case, then P2 = 2 * P_prev.\n\nBut since the planners are expecting a 10% increase each of the next two years, from Year 0 to Year 1 to Year 2. So:\n\nP0 is the current population.\n\nP1 = 1.1 P0.\n\nP2 = 1.1 P1 = 1.21 P0.\n\nThe problem says P2 = 2 * P_prev.\n\nBut P_prev is the population one year before the current time, which is P_prev = P0 / 1.1 (because the population increased by 10% to reach P0 from P_prev).\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nP2 = 2 * P_prev \u2192 1.21 P0 = 2 * (P0 / 1.1).\n\nLet me compute the right side: 2 * (P0 / 1.1) = (2/1.1) P0 \u2248 1.818 P0.\n\nSo, 1.21 P0 = 1.818 P0? That's not possible. So that suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is saying that the population two years from now is double the population of one year ago from two years from now. That is, one year before P2 would be P1. So P2 = 2 * P1.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers:\n\nP2 = 1.21 P0.\n\nP1 = 1.1 P0.\n\nSo 1.21 P0 = 2 * (1.1 P0) \u2192 1.21 = 2.2 \u2192 which is not correct. So this approach isn't working. Maybe I'm missing something in the problem setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the next two years, but that the projection is for the next two years, and the statement is about the population two years from now relative to one year ago from when? Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Boomtown urban planners expect the city\u2019s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year?\"\n\nWait, so the \"last year\" refers to the year before the current time, i.e., the population increase from one year ago to now.\n\nWait, but the question is asking about the percent increase over the last year. So if the current population is P, then one year ago it was P_prev, and the increase is (P - P_prev)/P_prev *100%.\n\nSo the problem is telling us that the projection is 10% increase each year for the next two years, and under this projection, P2 = 2 * P_prev, where P_prev is one year ago from now.\n\nWait, let me set up the variables again.\n\nLet me let P_prev be the population one year ago (Year -1), and P0 is the current population (Year 0).\n\nSo, P0 = P_prev * 1.1 (because it increased by 10% from Year -1 to Year 0).\n\nThen, the projection is for the next two years: P1 = P0 *1.1, and P2 = P1 *1.1 = P0 *1.21.\n\nThe problem states that P2 = 2 * P_prev.\n\nSo substituting:\n\nP2 = P0 *1.21 = 2 * P_prev.\n\nBut P0 = P_prev *1.1 \u2192 substitute P_prev = P0 /1.1.\n\nSo,\n\nP0 *1.21 = 2 * (P0 /1.1).\n\nDivide both sides by P0:\n\n1.21 = 2 / 1.1 \u2192 compute 2/1.1 \u2192 approximately 1.818.\n\nSo, 1.21 \u2248 1.818? That's not correct. So something's wrong here.\n\nHmm. Maybe I misinterpreted the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nWait, the problem says that two years from now, the population is double the population of one year ago. Wait, perhaps \"one year ago\" is not from the current time but from the time of the projection.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the projection being made at a certain time. Let me try to model this.\n\nSuppose the current time is Year 0, and the population is P0.\n\nThe planners project that for the next two years (Year 1 and Year 2), the population will increase by 10% each year.\n\nSo:\n\nYear 1: P1 = 1.1 * P0.\n\nYear 2: P2 = 1.1 * P1 = 1.21 P0.\n\nThe problem states that if this projection holds, then P2 (two years from now) is double the population of one year ago. Wait, one year ago from when? From the current time (Year 0), one year ago is Year -1. But perhaps the projection is made from Year 1, and one year ago from that point is Year 0.\n\nWait, maybe the projection is made at Year 1. So, the projection is for the next two years, which would be Year 2 and Year 3.\n\nWait, that might complicate things. Let me try that approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's say the projection is made at Year 0. The next two years are Year 1 and Year 2.\n\nIn that case, the population two years from now is Year 2: P2 = 1.21 P0.\n\nThe population one year ago from the projection's current time (Year 0) is Year -1: P_{-1}.\n\nBut we don't know P_{-1}. However, the problem says that P2 = 2 * P_{-1}.\n\nBut we also know that from Year -1 to Year 0, the population increased by some rate. Let me call that rate r.\n\nSo, P0 = P_{-1} * (1 + r).\n\nWe have P2 = 1.21 P0 = 2 P_{-1}.\n\nSubstituting P_{-1} = P0 / (1 + r) into the equation:\n\n1.21 P0 = 2 * (P0 / (1 + r)).\n\nDivide both sides by P0:\n\n1.21 = 2 / (1 + r).\n\nMultiply both sides by (1 + r):\n\n1.21 (1 + r) = 2.\n\nDivide both sides by 1.21:\n\n1 + r = 2 / 1.21 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSo, r \u2248 1.65289 - 1 = 0.65289, or about 65.289%.\n\nSo the population increased by approximately 65.289% over the last year (from Year -1 to Year 0). Looking at the options, the closest is D) 65%.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the percent increase over the last year. Oh, but wait, the last year is from Year -1 to Year 0. So that's the growth rate that we're looking for.\n\nSo the correct answer would be approximately 65%, which is option D.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year, given that the population is projected to grow by 10% annually for the next two years, and that the population two years from now will be exactly double the population of one year ago.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( P_0 \\) be the current population.\n   - The population one year ago (one year before the current time) is \\( P_{-1} \\).\n   - The population two years from now is \\( P_2 \\).\n\n2. **Projection for the Next Two Years:**\n   - Next year (Year 1): \\( P_1 = 1.1 \\cdot P_0 \\).\n   - Two years from now (Year 2): \\( P_2 = 1.1 \\cdot P_1 = 1.21 \\cdot P_0 \\).\n\n3. **Relationship Between \\( P_2 \\) and \\( P_{-1} \\):**\n   - The problem states that \\( P_2 = 2 \\cdot P_{-1} \\).\n   - Since \\( P_0 = P_{-1} \\cdot (1 + r) \\), where \\( r \\) is the population growth rate over the last year, we can express \\( P_{-1} \\) as \\( P_{-1} = \\frac{P_0}{1 + r} \\).\n\n4. **Substitute \\( P_{-1} \\) into \\( P_2 = 2 \\cdot P_{-1} \\):**\n   - \\( P_2 = 1.21 \\cdot P_0 = 2 \\cdot \\frac{P_0}{1 + r} \\).\n   - Simplify: \\( 1.21 = \\frac{2}{1 + r} \\).\n\n5. **Solve for \\( r \\):**\n   - Multiply through by \\( 1 + r \\): \\( 1.21 \\cdot (1 + r) = 2 \\).\n   - Divide by 1.21: \\( 1 + r = \\frac{2}{1.21} \\approx 1.65289 \\).\n   - Subtract 1: \\( r \\approx 1.65289 - 1 = 0.65289 \\), or approximately 65.29%.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The percent population increase over the last year is approximately 65%, which corresponds to option **D**.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem about population growth in a place called Boomtown. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nAlright, the question says that the population is expected to increase by 10% each year for the next two years. So, if I think about it, that means each year the population grows by 10% of its current value. But wait, the problem also mentions that after two years, the population will be exactly double what it was one year ago. Oh wait, wait. Let me parse that again.\n\nThe population projection is for the next two years, so right now, the population is P. In one year, it'll be P plus 10% of P, which is 1.1P. Then, in the second year, it'll increase another 10%, so that's 1.1 times the previous year's population. So after two years, it's 1.1 * 1.1 * P, which is 1.21P. That's the population two years from now.\n\nBut the problem states that this future population (two years from now) is exactly double the population of one year ago. Wait, one year ago from when? I think it's one year ago from the current time, so that would be the population at time t-1, where t is now. Let me clarify the timeline.\n\nLet me set up some variables to make it clear. Let's say:\n\n- Let t be the current time.\n- Let t-1 be one year ago.\n- Let t+1 be one year from now.\n- Let t+2 be two years from now.\n\nSo, the current population is P(t). \n\nAccording to the problem, the planners expect a 10% increase each year for the next two years. So:\n\n- P(t+1) = P(t) * 1.10\n- P(t+2) = P(t+1) * 1.10 = P(t) * 1.10^2 = P(t) * 1.21\n\nThe problem states that P(t+2) is exactly double the population of one year ago. Wait, one year ago from when? Hmm, I think the statement is that P(t+2) equals double the population at time t-1.\n\nSo, P(t+2) = 2 * P(t-1). \n\nBut what is P(t-1)? Since the growth rate is 10% per year, P(t) is P(t-1) * 1.10. So, P(t-1) = P(t) / 1.10.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nP(t) * 1.21 = 2 * (P(t) / 1.10 )\n\nLet me write that equation:\n\n1.21 P(t) = 2 * (P(t) / 1.10 )\n\nHmm, I can simplify this. Let's divide both sides by P(t), assuming P(t) is not zero, which makes sense.\n\n1.21 = 2 / 1.10\n\nWait, let me compute 2 divided by 1.10. 1.10 is 11/10, so 2 / (11/10) = 2 * (10/11) = 20/11 \u2248 1.818.\n\nBut wait, 1.21 equals approximately 1.818? That can't be right. Hmm, that suggests maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the problem statement. Oh! Maybe I misread the timeline. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. So, P(t+2) = 2 * P(t-1). \n\nWait, but if the current time is t, then one year ago is t-1, and two years from now is t+2. So the equation is correct as I set it up.\n\nBut when I substitute, I get 1.21 P(t) = 2 * (P(t) / 1.10 ). Let me compute 2 / 1.10. 2 divided by 1.1 is approximately 1.818. So 1.21 P(t) = 1.818 P(t). That implies 1.21 = 1.818, which isn't correct. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, that suggests a problem with my initial assumption. Maybe I got the timeline wrong. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem refers to one year ago from two years from now. Wait, that would make the timeline a bit confusing. Let me think: if two years from now, the population is double the population of one year prior to that. So that would be one year before t+2, which is t+1.\n\nWait, that would change the equation. So P(t+2) = 2 * P(t+1). Let me try that.\n\nSo P(t+2) = 2 * P(t+1). \n\nWe know that P(t+2) = 1.1 * P(t+1), because each year it increases by 10%. \n\nSo 1.1 P(t+1) = 2 P(t+1). That would imply 1.1 = 2, which is impossible. So that can't be the case.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\n\"the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.\"\n\nWait, maybe \"one year ago\" is one year before two years from now, which would be one year before t+2, which is t+1. So, P(t+2) = 2 * P(t+1).\n\nBut wait, as before, that gives 1.1 P(t+1) = 2 P(t+1), which simplifies to 1.1 = 2, which is impossible. So that can't be correct.\n\nHmm, maybe the problem is that I'm misapplying the time periods. Let me think differently. Let's imagine the current population is P. \n\nAccording to the planners, in one year, it'll be 1.1 P. Then, in two years, 1.1 * (1.1 P) = 1.21 P. \n\nThe problem says that the population two years from now is double the population one year ago. So, what is the population one year ago? It's the population at time t-1, which, given the current population is P, that would be P / 1.1, because a 10% increase from t-1 to t brings it to P. So P(t) = P(t-1) * 1.1 \u2192 P(t-1) = P(t)/1.1.\n\nSo, the equation is P(t+2) = 2 * P(t-1).\n\nSubstituting, 1.21 P = 2 * (P / 1.1 )\n\nSimplify the right side: 2 / 1.1 is approximately 1.818.\n\nSo 1.21 P = 1.818 P. Subtract 1.21 P from both sides: 0 = 0.608 P. That implies P is zero, which doesn't make sense. So there must be a mistake in my setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says that two years from now, the population is double that of one year ago from the current time. So, the current time is t, and one year ago is t-1. So, P(t+2) = 2 * P(t-1). \n\nBut according to our earlier calculation, that leads to 1.21 P = 2 * (P / 1.1 ), which implies 1.21 = 2 / 1.1 \u2192 1.21 = 1.818, which isn't true. So that can't be right either.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think differently. Maybe the problem is about the growth rate over the last year, not the future. The question is asking for the percent population increase over the last year, which would be the growth from t-1 to t.\n\nLet me denote the population at t-1 as P_prev, and the current population as P_current. So, P_current = P_prev * (1 + r), where r is the growth rate we're trying to find.\n\nBut according to the problem, the planners expect a 10% increase each of the next two years, so P_current is now, and in one year (t+1), it's P_current * 1.1, and in two years (t+2), it's (P_current * 1.1) * 1.1 = P_current * 1.21.\n\nBut the problem states that P(t+2) = 2 * P(t-1). So P_current * 1.21 = 2 * P_prev.\n\nBut since P_current = P_prev * (1 + r), substituting that in:\n\n(1 + r) * P_prev * 1.21 = 2 * P_prev.\n\nWe can divide both sides by P_prev (assuming it's not zero):\n\n(1 + r) * 1.21 = 2.\n\nSo, (1 + r) = 2 / 1.21.\n\nCompute 2 divided by 1.21. Let me calculate that. 1.21 is 121/100, so 2 / (121/100) = 200/121 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSo, 1 + r \u2248 1.65289 \u2192 r \u2248 0.65289, which is approximately 65.29% increase. \n\nLooking at the options, D is 65%, which is the closest to 65.29%. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The question is asking for the percent increase in the last year. So, the last year would be from t-1 to t, which is what we've just calculated as approximately 65%.\n\nSo the options are:\n\nA)20%\n\nB)40%\n\nC)50%\n\nD)65%\n\nE)75%\n\nSo D is 65%, which matches our calculation. So the correct answer should be D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem about population growth in a place called Boomtown. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nAlright, the question says that the population is expected to increase by 10% each year for the next two years. So, if I think about it, that means each year the population grows by 10% of its current value. But wait, the problem also mentions that after two years, the population will be exactly double what it was one year ago. Oh wait, wait. Let me parse that again.\n\nThe population projection is for the next two years, so right now, the population is P. In one year, it'll be P plus 10% of P, which is 1.1P. Then, in the second year, it'll increase another 10%, so that's 1.1 times the previous year's population. So after two years, it's 1.1 * 1.1 * P, which is 1.21P. That's the population two years from now.\n\nBut the problem states that this future population (two years from now) is exactly double the population of one year ago. Wait, one year ago from when? I think it's one year ago from the current time, so that would be the population at time t-1, where t is now. Let me clarify the timeline.\n\nLet me set up some variables to make it clear. Let's say:\n\n- Let t be the current time.\n- Let t-1 be one year ago.\n- Let t+1 be one year from now.\n- Let t+2 be two years from now.\n\nSo, the current population is P(t). \n\nAccording to the problem, the planners expect a 10% increase each year for the next two years. So:\n\n- P(t+1) = P(t) * 1.10\n- P(t+2) = P(t+1) * 1.10 = P(t) * 1.10^2 = P(t) * 1.21\n\nThe problem states that P(t+2) is exactly double the population of one year ago. Wait, one year ago from when? Hmm, I think the statement is that P(t+2) equals double the population at time t-1.\n\nSo, P(t+2) = 2 * P(t-1). \n\nBut what is P(t-1)? Since the growth rate is 10% per year, P(t) is P(t-1) * 1.10. So, P(t-1) = P(t) / 1.10.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nP(t) * 1.21 = 2 * (P(t) / 1.10 )\n\nLet me write that equation:\n\n1.21 P(t) = 2 * (P(t) / 1.10 )\n\nHmm, I can simplify this. Let's divide both sides by P(t), assuming P(t) is not zero, which makes sense.\n\n1.21 = 2 / 1.10\n\nWait, let me compute 2 divided by 1.10. 1.10 is 11/10, so 2 / (11/10) = 2 * (10/11) = 20/11 \u2248 1.818.\n\nBut wait, 1.21 equals approximately 1.818? That can't be right. Hmm, that suggests maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the problem statement. Oh! Maybe I misread the timeline. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. So, P(t+2) = 2 * P(t-1). \n\nWait, but if the current time is t, then one year ago is t-1, and two years from now is t+2. So the equation is correct as I set it up.\n\nBut when I substitute, I get 1.21 P(t) = 2 * (P(t) / 1.10 ). Let me compute 2 / 1.10. 2 divided by 1.1 is approximately 1.818. So 1.21 P(t) = 1.818 P(t). That implies 1.21 = 1.818, which isn't correct. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, that suggests a problem with my initial assumption. Maybe I got the timeline wrong. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem refers to one year ago from two years from now. Wait, that would make the timeline a bit confusing. Let me think: if two years from now, the population is double the population of one year prior to that. So that would be one year before t+2, which is t+1.\n\nWait, that would change the equation. So P(t+2) = 2 * P(t+1). Let me try that.\n\nSo P(t+2) = 2 * P(t+1). \n\nWe know that P(t+2) = 1.1 * P(t+1), because each year it increases by 10%. \n\nSo 1.1 P(t+1) = 2 P(t+1). That would imply 1.1 = 2, which is impossible. So that can't be the case.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\n\"the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.\"\n\nWait, maybe \"one year ago\" is one year before two years from now, which would be one year before t+2, which is t+1. So, P(t+2) = 2 * P(t+1).\n\nBut wait, as before, that gives 1.1 P(t+1) = 2 P(t+1), which simplifies to 1.1 = 2, which is impossible. So that can't be correct.\n\nHmm, maybe the problem is that I'm misapplying the time periods. Let me think differently. Let's imagine the current population is P. \n\nAccording to the planners, in one year, it'll be 1.1 P. Then, in two years, 1.1 * (1.1 P) = 1.21 P. \n\nThe problem says that the population two years from now is double the population one year ago. So, what is the population one year ago? It's the population at time t-1, which, given the current population is P, that would be P / 1.1, because a 10% increase from t-1 to t brings it to P. So P(t) = P(t-1) * 1.1 \u2192 P(t-1) = P(t)/1.1.\n\nSo, the equation is P(t+2) = 2 * P(t-1).\n\nSubstituting, 1.21 P = 2 * (P / 1.1 )\n\nSimplify the right side: 2 / 1.1 is approximately 1.818.\n\nSo 1.21 P = 1.818 P. Subtract 1.21 P from both sides: 0 = 0.608 P. That implies P is zero, which doesn't make sense. So there must be a mistake in my setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says that two years from now, the population is double that of one year ago from the current time. So, the current time is t, and one year ago is t-1. So, P(t+2) = 2 * P(t-1). \n\nBut according to our earlier calculation, that leads to 1.21 P = 2 * (P / 1.1 ), which implies 1.21 = 2 / 1.1 \u2192 1.21 = 1.818, which isn't true. So that can't be right either.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think differently. Maybe the problem is about the growth rate over the last year, not the future. The question is asking for the percent population increase over the last year, which would be the growth from t-1 to t.\n\nLet me denote the population at t-1 as P_prev, and the current population as P_current. So, P_current = P_prev * (1 + r), where r is the growth rate we're trying to find.\n\nBut according to the problem, the planners expect a 10% increase each of the next two years, so P_current is now, and in one year (t+1), it's P_current * 1.1, and in two years (t+2), it's (P_current * 1.1) * 1.1 = P_current * 1.21.\n\nBut the problem states that P(t+2) = 2 * P(t-1). So P_current * 1.21 = 2 * P_prev.\n\nBut since P_current = P_prev * (1 + r), substituting that in:\n\n(1 + r) * P_prev * 1.21 = 2 * P_prev.\n\nWe can divide both sides by P_prev (assuming it's not zero):\n\n(1 + r) * 1.21 = 2.\n\nSo, (1 + r) = 2 / 1.21.\n\nCompute 2 divided by 1.21. Let me calculate that. 1.21 is 121/100, so 2 / (121/100) = 200/121 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSo, 1 + r \u2248 1.65289 \u2192 r \u2248 0.65289, which is approximately 65.29% increase. \n\nLooking at the options, D is 65%, which is the closest to 65.29%. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The question is asking for the percent increase in the last year. So, the last year would be from t-1 to t, which is what we've just calculated as approximately 65%.\n\nSo the options are:\n\nA)20%\n\nB)40%\n\nC)50%\n\nD)65%\n\nE)75%\n\nSo D is 65%, which matches our calculation. So the correct answer should be D.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information:\n\n1. Let the current population be \\( P \\).\n2. The population one year ago is \\( P_{\\text{prev}} = \\frac{P}{1.1} \\), since the population increases by 10% each year.\n3. Two years from now, the population will be \\( P_{\\text{future}} = P \\times 1.1^2 = 1.21P \\).\n4.

Let me read the question again.\n\nWait, the question says: \"Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year?\" So, the last year, which is the year before the projection started? Or is it the previous year? Hmm, maybe I should clarify the timeline.\n\nLet me try to structure this. Let's say the current population is P. But wait, the problem talks about the population two years from now and one year ago. So perhaps I should set up some variables.\n\nLet me denote:\n- Let\u2019s say the population one year ago was P.\n- Then, the population last year (current year) would be P plus 10% of P, but wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the planners expect a 10% increase each year for the next two years. So the next two years are the future, but the question is about the past year's increase. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.\" So, two years into the future (from now) is P_future = P_one_year_ago * 2. But wait, the projection is for the next two years, so the expected growth is 10% each year for the next two years. So the future population in two years is based on the current population, which I think is one year after the past year.\n\nWait, maybe I should define the current population as P. Then, two years from now, it's P * (1.10)^2, because each year it increases by 10%. So that's the future population.\n\nBut the problem says that two years from now, the population will be double what it was one year ago. So, one year ago, the population was P / 1.10, because if last year was P, then the previous year was P divided by 1.10 (since P = previous year * 1.10). Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the timeline.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- Let t be the current year.\n\n- So, the population one year ago (at time t-1) is P.\n\n- The population at time t is P_current = P * (1 + r), where r is the growth rate for that year (the past year). Wait, but the problem is about the past year's growth rate. Oh, wait, no: the problem says that the projection is for the next two years, each with 10% growth. So the past year's growth rate is what we need to find.\n\nWait, perhaps the current population is P, which is the population at time t. The population one year ago (time t-1) was P_prev, and the population at time t is P = P_prev * (1 + r), where r is the growth rate from t-1 to t. We need to find r.\n\nThe projection is that for the next two years (times t+1 and t+2), the population grows by 10% each year. So, the population at t+1 would be P * 1.10, and at t+2, it would be P * (1.10)^2.\n\nThe problem states that the population at t+2 is exactly double the population at t-1. So, P*(1.10)^2 = 2 * P_prev.\n\nBut P_prev is the population one year ago, which is P / (1 + r). Because P = P_prev * (1 + r) \u2192 P_prev = P/(1 + r).\n\nSo substituting into the equation:\n\nP*(1.10)^2 = 2 * [P / (1 + r)].\n\nI can cancel P from both sides:\n\n(1.10)^2 = 2 / (1 + r).\n\nLet me compute (1.10)^2. 1.1 * 1.1 is 1.21. So,\n\n1.21 = 2 / (1 + r)\n\nMultiply both sides by (1 + r):\n\n1.21 * (1 + r) = 2.\n\nDivide both sides by 1.21:\n\n1 + r = 2 / 1.21.\n\nCompute 2 / 1.21. Let's see: 1.21 times 1.65 is approximately 2 (since 1.21 * 1.6 is 1.936, and 1.21 * 1.65 is 2.0015). So 2/1.21 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSo 1 + r \u2248 1.65289 \u2192 r \u2248 0.65289, which is approximately 65.29%.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is D) 65%.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the math to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nSo, P(t+2) = P(t) * (1.10)^2 = P(t) * 1.21.\n\nBut P(t+2) = 2 * P(t-1).\n\nAnd P(t) = P(t-1) * (1 + r) \u2192 P(t-1) = P(t)/(1 + r).\n\nSo substituting into P(t+2) = 2 * [P(t)/(1 + r)].\n\nWhich gives 1.21 * P(t) = 2 * P(t)/(1 + r).\n\nDivide both sides by P(t):\n\n1.21 = 2/(1 + r) \u2192 1 + r = 2/1.21 \u2192 2 / 1.21 \u2248 1.65289 \u2192 r \u2248 0.65289 \u2192 65.289%.\n\nSo yes, the correct answer is D) 65%.\n",
