      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about two ants moving towards each other. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Hmm, alright, let's see.\n\nSo, Ant A is moving at 9 cm per hour, and Ant B is moving at 6 cm per hour. Their farms are 75 cm apart. I need to find the distance Ant A travels until they meet. \n\nWait, when two objects move towards each other, their speeds add up, right? Because they're approaching each other, so the time until they meet depends on their combined speed. Oh right, I remember that from physics. So the relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds.\n\nSo, let's calculate the combined speed. Ant A's speed is 9 cm/h, Ant B's is 6 cm/h. Adding those together: 9 + 6 equals 15 cm/h. That makes sense because they're moving towards each other, so their speeds add.\n\nNow, the total distance between the farms is 75 cm. So, the time it takes for them to meet should be the total distance divided by their combined speed. Time equals distance over speed, yeah. So time is 75 cm divided by 15 cm/h. Let me do that calculation: 75 divided by 15 is 5. So the time until they meet is 5 hours.\n\nWait, wait. No, wait. Because the units are cm and cm per hour. So 75 cm divided by 15 cm/h gives hours. So 75 /15 is indeed 5 hours. So they meet after 5 hours.\n\nBut wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because 15 cm/h is the combined speed, and the distance is 75 cm. Oh, right, because in one hour together, they cover 15 cm. So to cover 75 cm, it's 75 /15 = 5 hours. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo now, to find out how far Ant A has traveled in that time. Ant A's speed is 9 cm/h. So distance is speed multiplied by time. 9 cm/h * 5 h = 45 cm. Wait, but wait, let me double-check. 9 times 5 is 45. So the distance Ant A travels is 45 cm.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 45. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait a second, but wait another thing. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the speeds. Ant A is faster, so it should cover more distance, but wait, 45 is only part of the total. Let me see: if the total is 75 cm, and Ant A went 45 cm, then Ant B would have gone 75 -45 =30 cm. Does that make sense with their speeds?\n\nAnt A's speed is 9 cm/h, so in 5 hours, 9*5=45. Ant B's speed is 6 cm/h, so 6*5=30. 45 +30=75, which matches the total. So that's correct. So the distance for Ant A is 45 cm.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again. Oh, wait, the options are A)45, B)48, etc. So 45 is option A. So I think that's the correct answer.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the distance Ant A travels until meeting Ant B, we start by calculating their combined speed.

So if Ant A went 45 cm, then Ant B would have gone 75 - 45 = 30 cm. Let's check if that makes sense with their speeds.\n\nAnt B's speed is 6 cm/hour. So in 5 hours, it would go 6 *5 =30 cm.

Their farms are 75 cm apart. I need to find out how far Ant A travels before they meet.\n\nWait, right. Since they're moving towards each other, their speeds add up. Oh right, because the distance between them is closing at the combined rate of both ants. So the total speed would be 9 + 6 = 15 cm per hour.\n\nWait, but wait a second. So the total distance is 75 cm. So the time it takes for them to meet is the total distance divided by their combined speed. That makes sense. So time equals distance over speed. So time = 75 / 15. Let me calculate that. 75 divided by 15 is 5. Oh, so they meet after 5 hours.\n\nBut wait, wait. So Ant A is moving at 9 cm per hour. So in 5 hours, how far does Ant A go? Oh right, distance equals speed multiplied by time. So 9 cm/hour * 5 hours = 45 cm. So Ant A would have traveled 45 cm. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 45. So that's probably the answer. But wait, let me double-check. Because sometimes it's easy to mix up which ant is which.\n\nWait, Ant A is moving faster. So it should cover more distance? Wait no, wait. Wait, no, because both are moving towards each other. Wait, if the total distance is 75 cm, and they meet after 5 hours, then the sum of the distances each has traveled is 75 cm. So if Ant A went 45 cm, then Ant B would have gone 75 - 45 = 30 cm. Let's check if that makes sense with their speeds.\n\nAnt B's speed is 6 cm/hour. So in 5 hours, it would go 6 *5 =30 cm.

So that should be the correct answer. \n\nWait a second, did I miss anything? Let me double-check. Both ants are moving towards each other, so the time is correct. Ant A's distance is speed multiplied by time, which is 9 *5=45. Yep, that seems right.\n\n\nTo determine the distance ant A travels before meeting ant B, we start by noting that the ants are moving towards each other with speeds of 9 cm/h and 6 cm/h, respectively. The total distance between their farms is 75 cm. \n\nSince they are moving towards each other, their speeds add up, giving a combined speed of:\n\n\\[\n9 \\, \\text{cm/h} + 6 \\, \\text{cm/h} = 15 \\, \\text{cm/h}.\n\\]\n\nThe time it takes for them to meet is the total distance divided by their combined speed:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Combined Speed}} = \\frac{75 \\, \\text{cm}}{15 \\, \\text{cm/h}} = 5 \\, \\text{hours}.\n\\]\n\nTo find the distance ant A travels, we multiply its speed by the time:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance A travels} = \\text{Speed of A} \\times \\text{Time} = 9 \\, \\text{cm/h} \\times 5 \\, \\text{hours} = 45 \\, \\text{cm}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the distance ant A travels before meeting ant B is **45 cm**, which corresponds to option A.\n\nAnswer: A",
