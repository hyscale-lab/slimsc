      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where when you divide 2272 and 875 by a 3-digit number N, the remainder is the same. I need to find the sum of the digits of N, and the options are from 10 to 14. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that if two numbers leave the same remainder when divided by N, then their difference is a multiple of N. So, if I subtract 875 from 2272, the result should be divisible by N. Let me calculate that difference.\n\n2272 minus 875. Let's see, 2272 - 800 is 1472, and then minus 75 more would be 1397. So N must be a divisor of 1397.\n\nWait, but N is a 3-digit number. So I need to find all the 3-digit divisors of 1397. Hmm, maybe I should factorize 1397 first.\n\nLet me try dividing 1397 by some small primes. Does 2 divide it? No, because it's odd. How about 3? The sum of digits is 1+3+9+7 = 20, which isn't divisible by 3. Next, 5? Ends with 7, so no.\n\nWhat about 7? Let me check 1397 divided by 7. 7 goes into 1397 how many times? 7*199 is 1393. Hmm, 1397 minus 1393 is 4. So 1397 = 7*199 +4. So 7 isn't a factor.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me recalculate. 7 times 199 is 1393. So 1397 minus 1393 is 4. So no, 7 isn't a factor.\n\nHow about 11? The divisibility rule for 11 is alternating sum. So (1 +9) - (3 +7) = (10) - (10) = 0. Oh, that's divisible by 11. So 1397 \u00f711. Let me compute that.\n\n11 times 127 is 1397, right? Let me check: 11*120=1320, 11*7=77, so 1320+77=1397. Yes! So 1397 = 11 * 127.\n\nWait, but 127 is a prime number, I think. Because it's not divisible by 2,3,5,7,11. Let me check: 127 divided by 7 is about 18.14, not a whole number. So yes, 127 is prime. So the factors of 1397 are 1, 11, 127, and 1397.\n\nBut N is a 3-digit number, so possible candidates are 11 and 127? Wait, no. 11 is a two-digit number, and 127 is a 3-digit number. Oh wait, 127 is a 3-digit number, yes. Because 100 \u2264127 \u2264999.\n\nWait, but wait, wait. 1397 is 11 * 127, so the divisors are 1, 11, 127, 1397. So the only 3-digit divisor is 127. So N must be 127.\n\nWait, but is that the only possibility? Because N is a 3-digit number, and 1397 has only 127 as a 3-digit divisor. So N must be 127.\n\nSo the sum of the digits of N is 1 + 2 +7 =10. Wait, but looking at the options, A is 10. But wait, let me check if there are other possibilities.\n\nWait, wait a minute. Maybe I'm missing something. Because 1397 is 11*127, but perhaps N could be a divisor of 1397 that's a 3-digit number. Are there any other factors?\n\nHmm, 1397 \u00f7 127 is 11. So 127 is a factor, and the other factors are 1, 11, 127, 1397. So no, 127 is the only 3-digit factor.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Suppose that when you divide 2272 and 875 by N, the remainder is the same. So 2272 = a*N + r, and 875 = b*N + r, where r is less than N. So subtracting, 2272 -875 = (a - b) * N. So 1397 = (a-b)*N. So N must be a divisor of 1397. So N can be 127.\n\nSo N is 127. Then sum of digits is 1+2+7=10, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, the options include 10 as A. So the answer would be A)10.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Is N allowed to be a 3-digit number that divides 1397? Because 1397 is 11*127, so N can be 127 or 1397, but 1397 is a 4-digit number, so N must be 127.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the sum is 1+2+7=10, which is option A.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says: When 2272 and 875 are divided by a 3-digit number N, they leave the same remainder. We need to find the sum of the digits of N, and the options are A)10, B)11, C)12, D)13, E)14.\n\nHmm. So, I remember that when two numbers are divided by the same divisor and leave the same remainder, the difference between those two numbers is a multiple of the divisor. Let me think why that is. Oh right, because if you have two numbers, say a and b, and when you divide them by N, they both leave a remainder r. Then a = N * k + r and b = N * m + r, where k and m are integers. If I subtract b from a, I get a - b = N*(k - m). So the difference is a multiple of N. That makes sense.\n\nSo in this problem, the two numbers are 2272 and 875. Let me compute their difference. 2272 minus 875. Let's see, 2272 - 800 is 1472, then subtract 75 more, so 1472 -75 is 1397. So 2272 - 875 = 1397. So N must be a divisor of 1397, and also, N is a 3-digit number. Because the problem says N is a 3-digit number.\n\nWait, but N has to be a 3-digit number, so N is between 100 and 999. So I need to find the divisors of 1397 that are 3-digit numbers. Then, once I find N, I can compute the sum of its digits.\n\nSo first, I should factorize 1397 to find its divisors. Let's see, 1397. I'm not sure what factors it has, so I'll try dividing by some primes.\n\nLet me check if 1397 is divisible by 2. 1397 is odd, so no. Next, 3: sum of digits is 1+3+9+7=20, which isn't divisible by 3, so no. 5: last digit isn't 0 or 5, so no. Next, 7: let me try dividing 1397 by 7. 7*199 is 1393. 1393 +7 is 1400, which is 7*200. So 1397 minus 1393 is 4. So 1397 divided by 7 is 199 with remainder 4. So not divisible by 7.\n\nHow about 11? Let's apply the divisibility rule for 11: subtract the sum of the digits in the odd positions from the sum in the even positions. For 1397: (1 + 9) - (3 +7) = (10) - (10) = 0. Oh, so it is divisible by 11. So 1397 \u00f711.\n\nLet me compute that. 11 times 127 is 1397, because 127 *10 is 1270, plus 127*1 is 127, so 1270+127=1397. So 11 *127=1397. So the factors of 1397 are 1, 11, 127, and 1397.\n\nWait, but N is a 3-digit number. So possible values for N are 127 and 1397? Wait, 1397 is a four-digit number, so that's not possible. So the only 3-digit divisor is 127. So N must be 127.\n\nWait, wait a minute. Wait, 1397 is 11 * 127. So the factors are 1, 11, 127, and 1397. So N must be a 3-digit divisor.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says: When 2272 and 875 are divided by a 3-digit number N, they leave the same remainder. We need to find the sum of the digits of N, and the options are A)10, B)11, C)12, D)13, E)14.\n\nHmm. So, I remember that when two numbers are divided by the same divisor and leave the same remainder, the difference between those two numbers is a multiple of the divisor. Let me think why that is. Oh right, because if you have two numbers, say a and b, and when you divide them by N, they both leave a remainder r. Then a = N * k + r and b = N * m + r, where k and m are integers. If I subtract b from a, I get a - b = N*(k - m). So the difference is a multiple of N. That makes sense.\n\nSo in this problem, the two numbers are 2272 and 875. Let me compute their difference. 2272 minus 875. Let's see, 2272 - 800 is 1472, then subtract 75 more, so 1472 -75 is 1397. So 2272 - 875 = 1397. So N must be a divisor of 1397, and also, N is a 3-digit number. Because the problem says N is a 3-digit number.\n\nWait, but N has to be a 3-digit number, so N is between 100 and 999. So I need to find the divisors of 1397 that are 3-digit numbers. Then, once I find N, I can compute the sum of its digits.\n\nSo first, I should factorize 1397 to find its divisors. Let's see, 1397. I'm not sure what factors it has, so I'll try dividing by some primes.\n\nLet me check if 1397 is divisible by 2. 1397 is odd, so no. Next, 3: sum of digits is 1+3+9+7=20, which isn't divisible by 3, so no. 5: last digit isn't 0 or 5, so no. Next, 7: let me try dividing 1397 by 7. 7*199 is 1393. 1393 +7 is 1400, which is 7*200. So 1397 minus 1393 is 4. So 1397 divided by 7 is 199 with remainder 4. So not divisible by 7.\n\nHow about 11? Let's apply the divisibility rule for 11: subtract the sum of the digits in the odd positions from the sum in the even positions. For 1397: (1 + 9) - (3 +7) = (10) - (10) = 0. Oh, so it is divisible by 11. So 1397 \u00f711.\n\nLet me compute that. 11 times 127 is 1397, because 127 *10 is 1270, plus 127*1 is 127, so 1270+127=1397. So 11 *127=1397. So the factors of 1397 are 1, 11, 127, and 1397.\n\nWait, but N is a 3-digit number. So possible values for N are 127 and 1397? Wait, 1397 is a four-digit number, so that's not possible. So the only 3-digit divisor is 127. So N must be 127.\n\nWait, wait a minute. Wait, 1397 is 11 * 127. So the factors are 1, 11, 127, and 1397. So N must be a 3-digit divisor. So the only possible is 127. Because 11 is two-digit, and 1397 is four-digit. So N is 127.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. So 127 is a three-digit number. So yes.\n\nNow, let's check if 2272 and 875 when divided by 127 leave the same remainder.\n\nWait, perhaps I should verify that.\n\nLet me compute 2272 \u00f7 127.

Let's compute 127*6=762. 762 +127=889, which is larger than 875. So 127*6=762. 875-762=113. So remainder is 113. Yes, same remainder. So N is 127.\n\nSo the sum of the digits of N is 1 + 2 +7 = 10. Wait, 1+2=3, plus 7 is 10. So the sum is 10. So the answer would be option A)10.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check. Because I might have made a mistake in the calculation.

Oh right! Because if both numbers have the same remainder when divided by N, then subtracting them should eliminate the remainder, leaving a multiple of N.\n\nSo, let me write that down. Let's say 2272 divided by N leaves a remainder R, and 875 divided by N also leaves R. So mathematically, 2272 = a*N + R and 875 = b*N + R, where a and b are the quotients. If I subtract these two equations, the R's will cancel out.\n\nSo, 2272 - 875 = (a*N + R) - (b*N + R) = (a - b)*N. That simplifies to 2272 - 875 = (a - b)*N.\n\nCalculating 2272 minus 875: 2272 - 800 is 1472, minus 75 is 1397. So 1397 equals (a - b)*N.

Now, 127 is a prime number, I think. Let me check: 127 divided by 2 is 63.5, no. 3? 1+2+7=10, not divisible by 3. 5? No. 7? 7*18=126, so 127 is 7*18 +1, so no. 11? 11*11=121, 127-121=6, so no.

So N must be 127.\n\nNow, the sum of the digits of N. Let's see: 1 + 2 +7=10. So the sum is 10. Looking at the options, option A is 10.\n\nBut wait, the options have A)10, which would be the answer.

The options are A)10, B)11, C)12, D)13, E)14.\n\nHmm, right. So, both 2272 and 875, when divided by N, leave the same remainder.

So only 127 is a 3-digit divisor.\n\nWait, but wait a second. 127 is a 3-digit number. So N must be 127.\n\nNow, let's confirm. When we divide 2272 and 875 by 127, do they leave the same remainder?\n\nLet me compute 2272 divided by 127. Hmm, 127 * 17 is 2159 (because 127*10=1270, 127*7=889; 1270+889=2159). 2272 - 2159 = 113. So remainder is 113.\n\nNow, 875 divided by 127. Let's see. 127*6=762. 875-762=113. So remainder is 113. Yep, same remainder. So N is 127.\n\nThe question asks for the sum of the digits of N. N is 127. So 1 + 2 +7 = 10. Wait, 1+2 is 3, plus 7 is 10. So the sum is 10, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 10. So the answer should be A.\n\nBut wait, did I miss any other possible 3-digit divisors? Because 1397 is 11 * 127. Are there any other factors? Let me think again. 11 and 127 are primes. So the only 3-digit divisor is 127. So that's the only N.\n\nSo the sum of digits is 1+2+7=10. So the answer is A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. \n\nThe question says: When 2272 and 875 are divided by a 3-digit number N, they give the same remainder. I need to find the sum of the digits of N. The options are A)10, B)11, C)12, D)13, E)14.\n\nHmm, right. So, both 2272 and 875, when divided by N, leave the same remainder. Let me think about what that implies.\n\nI remember that if two numbers, say A and B, when divided by some number N, leave the same remainder, then the difference between A and B should be divisible by N. Because the remainders are the same, subtracting them would eliminate the remainder, leaving a multiple of N.\n\nSo, let me calculate the difference between 2272 and 875. 2272 minus 875 is... let's see, 2272 minus 800 is 1472, then minus 75 more is 1397. So 2272 - 875 = 1397.\n\nThat means N must be a divisor of 1397. But wait, N is a 3-digit number. So I need to find all the 3-digit divisors of 1397 and then figure out which one fits.\n\nFirst, I should factorize 1397 to find its divisors. Let's see. I'll start by checking divisibility by smaller primes.\n\nIs 1397 even? No, because it ends with a 7. So not divisible by 2. How about 3? The sum of the digits is 1+3+9+7=20, which isn't divisible by 3, so no. Next, 5? It doesn't end with 0 or 5, so nope.\n\nWhat about 7? Let me check. 1397 divided by 7. 7 times 199 is 1393, because 7*200=1400, subtract 7 gives 1393. So 1397 minus 1393 is 4. So 7 doesn't divide it exactly.\n\nNext, 11. The rule for 11 is alternating sum of digits. (1 +9) - (3 +7) = (10) - (10) = 0. Oh, since the result is 0, it's divisible by 11. So 1397 divided by 11 is?\n\nLet me compute 11 times 127 is 1397. Because 11*120=1320, and 11*7=77, so 1320+77=1397. So 11 * 127 = 1397.\n\nWait, so the factors of 1397 are 1, 11, 127, and 1397. Because 127 is a prime number?

The problem says that when 2272 and 875 are divided by a 3-digit number N, they leave the same remainder. I need to find the sum of the digits of N, and the options are given from A to E.\n\nHmm, right. So, both divisions give the same remainder. Let me think about what that implies. When two numbers are divided by the same divisor and leave the same remainder, the difference between those two numbers should be divisible by the divisor. Because the remainder cancels out when you subtract them.\n\nSo, 2272 minus 875 equals... let me calculate that. 2272 - 875. Let's see: 2272 - 800 is 1472, then subtract 75 more, which gives 1397. So, 1397 is the difference. That means N must be a divisor of 1397.\n\nWait, but N is a 3-digit number. So, I need to find all the 3-digit divisors of 1397 and then determine which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I should factorize 1397 to find its divisors. Let me see. I'll try dividing 1397 by some primes.\n\nIs 1397 even? No, because it ends with 7. So, 2 isn't a factor. How about 3? Let me add the digits: 1+3+9+7=20. 20 isn't divisible by 3, so 3 isn't a factor. Next, 5: it ends with 7, so no.\n\nLet's try 7. 7 times 199 is 1393. Hmm, 1397 minus 1393 is 4, so 7 isn't a factor because 1397 divided by 7 gives a remainder of 4.\n\nWait, maybe I should do the division properly. 7 into 1397: 7*199 is 1393, as I thought. 1397-1393=4, so remainder 4. So, 7 isn't a factor.\n\nWhat about 11? The rule for 11 is alternating sum of digits. So, (1 +9) - (3+7) = (10) - (10) =0. Oh, that's divisible by 11. So, 11 is a factor.\n\nSo, 1397 divided by 11 is... let me compute that. 11*127 is 1397? Wait, 11*120 is 1320, and 11*7 is 77, so 1320+77=1397. Yes, so 1397 = 11 * 127.\n\nWait, is 127 a prime number? Let me think. 127 divided by 2, no. 3? 1+2+7=10, not divisible by 3. 5? Ends with 7, no. 7? 7*18 is 126, so 127-126=1. So, 127 isn't divisible by 7. 11? 11*11 is 121, 121+6=127, so no. Next prime is 13: 13*9=117, 117+10=127, so no. 17: 17*7=119, 119+8=127, no. So, 127 is a prime. So, the factors of 1397 are 1, 11, 127, and 1397.\n\nBut N is a 3-digit number. So, the possible N could be 127 or 11, but 11 is a two-digit number. Wait, wait, 127 is a 3-digit number, right? So N must be 127.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Because when you divide a number by N, the remainder has to be less than N. So, if N is 127, then the remainder when 875 is divided by 127 must be less than 127, which it is. Let me check that.\n\nLet me compute 875 divided by 127. 127 * 6 is 762, subtract that from 875: 875 -762=113. So, remainder is 113.\n\nNow, what's 2272 divided by 127? Let me compute 127 * 17 is 2159. 2272 -2159=113. So, the remainder is 113. So yes, both give the same remainder, 113. So N is 127.\n\nNow, the sum of the digits of N, which is 127. So, 1 + 2 +7=10.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 10. So the answer should be A.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check. Are there any other 3-digit divisors of 1397? Because 1397 is 11*127, and both 11 and 127 are primes. So, the only 3-digit divisor is 127. So, N must be 127, sum of digits 10, option A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The problem says that when 2272 and 875 are divided by a 3-digit number N, they leave the same remainder. I need to find the sum of the digits of N, and the options are given from A to E.\n\nHmm, right. So, both divisions give the same remainder. Let me think about what that implies. When two numbers are divided by the same divisor and leave the same remainder, the difference between those two numbers should be divisible by the divisor. Because the remainder cancels out when you subtract them.\n\nSo, 2272 minus 875 equals... let me calculate that. 2272 - 875. Let's see: 2272 - 800 is 1472, then subtract 75 more, which gives 1397. So, 1397 is the difference. That means N must be a divisor of 1397.\n\nWait, but N is a 3-digit number. So, I need to find all the 3-digit divisors of 1397 and then determine which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I should factorize 1397 to find its divisors. Let me see. I'll try dividing 1397 by some primes.\n\nIs 1397 even? No, because it ends with 7. So, 2 isn't a factor. How about 3? Let me add the digits: 1+3+9+7=20. 20 isn't divisible by 3, so 3 isn't a factor. Next, 5: it ends with 7, so no.\n\nLet's try 7. 7 times 199 is 1393. Hmm, 1397 minus 1393 is 4, so 7 isn't a factor because 1397 divided by 7 gives a remainder of 4.\n\nWait, maybe I should do the division properly. 7 into 1397: 7*199 is 1393, as I thought. 1397-1393=4, so remainder 4. So, 7 isn't a factor.\n\nWhat about 11? The rule for 11 is alternating sum of digits. So, (1 +9) - (3+7) = (10) - (10) =0. Oh, that's divisible by 11. So, 11 is a factor.\n\nSo, 1397 divided by 11 is... let me compute that. 11*127 is 1397? Wait, 11*120 is 1320, and 11*7 is 77, so 1320+77=1397. Yes, so 1397 = 11 * 127.\n\nWait, is 127 a prime number? Let me think. 127 divided by 2, no. 3? 1+2+7=10, not divisible by 3. 5? Ends with 7, no. 7? 7*18 is 126, so 127-126=1. So, 127 isn't divisible by 7. 11? 11*11 is 121, 121+6=127, so no. Next prime is 13: 13*9=117, 117+10=127, so no. 17: 17*7=119, 119+8=127, no. So, 127 is a prime. So, the factors of 1397 are 1, 11, 127, and 1397.\n\nBut N is a 3-digit number. So, the possible N could be 127 or 11, but 11 is a two-digit number. Wait, wait, 127 is a 3-digit number, right? So N must be 127.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Because when you divide a number by N, the remainder has to be less than N. So, if N is 127, then the remainder when 875 is divided by 127 must be less than 127, which it is. Let me check that.\n\nLet me compute 875 divided by 127. 127 * 6 is 762, subtract that from 875: 875 -762=113. So, remainder is 113.\n\nNow, what's 2272 divided by 127? Let me compute 127 * 17 is 2159. 2272 -2159=113. So, the remainder is 113. So yes, both give the same remainder, 113. So N is 127.\n\nNow, the sum of the digits of N, which is 127. So, 1 + 2 +7=10.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 10. So the answer should be A.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check. Are there any other 3-digit divisors of 1397? Because 1397 is 11*127, and both 11 and 127 are primes. So, the only 3-digit divisor is 127. So, N must be 127, sum of digits 10, option A.\n\n\nWhen 2272 and 875 are divided by a 3-digit number \\( N \\), they leave the same remainder. This implies that the difference between the two numbers, \\( 2272 - 875 = 1397 \\), must be divisible by \\( N \\). Therefore, \\( N \\) is a 3-digit divisor of 1397.\n\nTo find the divisors of 1397, we factorize it. Checking for divisibility, we find that \\( 1397 = 11 \\times 127 \\). Both 11 and 127 are prime numbers, so the divisors of 1397 are 1, 11, 127, and 1397.

But N is a 3-digit number. So I need to find all the 3-digit divisors of 1397 and then check which one is possible.\n\nWait, but how do I find the divisors of 1397? Maybe I should factorize 1397. Let me try.\n\nLet me see, is 1397 divisible by small primes? Let's test 7: 7 * 199 is 1393, which is close but not 1397. Hmm, maybe 1397 divided by 11? Let me do 1397 \u00f7 11.\n\n11 * 127 is 1397 because 11*120=1320, 11*7=77, 1320+77=1397. Oh, so 1397 = 11 * 127.\n\nWait, but 127 is a prime number, right? Let me check: 127 divided by 2 is not, 3? 1+2+7=10, not divisible by 3. 5? No, ends with 7. 7? 127 \u00f77 is about 18.14, no. 11? 11*11 is 121, 127-121=6, so no. 13? 13*9=117, 13*10=130, so no. So 127 is prime.\n\nSo the prime factors of 1397 are 11 and 127. So the divisors would be 1, 11, 127, and 1397. But N is a 3-digit number, so N must be 127 or 11, but wait, 11 is a two-digit number. So the only possible 3-digit divisor is 127. But wait, 127 is a 3-digit number? No, wait, 127 is 3 digits? Wait, 100 is the first 3-digit number. So 127 is a 3-digit number. So N is 127.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. The problem states that N is a 3-digit number. So 127 is a 3-digit number. So N=127.\n\nSo the sum of the digits of N is 1 + 2 +7 = 10. So the answer should be 10, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes when you have the same remainder, you have to make sure that the remainder is less than N.\n\nSo, when 2272 is divided by 127, what's the remainder? Let me calculate 2272 \u00f7 127.\n\n127 * 17 = 2159 (since 127*10=1270, 127*7=889, 1270+889=2159). Then 2272 - 2159 = 113. So the remainder is 113.\n\nSimilarly, 875 \u00f7127. Let's see, 127 * 6 = 762. 875-762=113. So the remainder is 113 in both cases. So yes, that works.\n\nSo N is 127, sum of digits is 1+2+7=10, option A.\n",
