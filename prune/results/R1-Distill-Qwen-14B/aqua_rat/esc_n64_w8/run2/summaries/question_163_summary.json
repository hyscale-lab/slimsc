      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about a man who spends 70% of his income. Then his income increases by 20%, and we need to find out what his new expenditure will be as a percentage. The options are A to E, with various percentages.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused about where to start. Let me think. So, the man's current spending is 70% of his income. That means his saving is 30%, right? Because 100% minus 70% is 30%. \n\nNow, his income goes up by 20%. Wait, does that mean his income becomes 120% of the original? Because an increase of 20% is multiplying the original by 1.2. So, if his income was, say, $100 before, it would be $120 after the increase.\n\nBut wait, the question is about his expenditure. So, does he change his spending? Or does he continue to spend the same absolute amount? Hmm, I think the problem assumes that his expenditure remains the same in terms of the original income. Because if his income increases, but he continues to spend the same proportion, that's different than if he just keeps his spending the same in absolute terms.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. The problem says he spends 70% of his income. So, if his income increases, his spending would also increase by the same percentage if his expenditure proportion remains the same. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the problem might be trickier.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. If his income increases by 20%, but he continues to spend the same percentage, then his expenditure as a percentage of his new income would be the same as before. So, 70% of his new income would still be his spending. But that doesn't make sense because the options don't have 70% as an option. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, maybe the question is implying that his expenditure increases in absolute terms, not in percentage. Let me see. Let's take an example. Suppose his original income is $100. He spends 70% of that, which is $70. Now, his income increases by 20%, so his new income is $120. If his spending remains the same as a proportion of income, he'd spend 70% of $120, which is $84. But that's not what the question is asking. The question is asking what his new expenditure is as a percentage, I think.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, the question says, his income increases by 20%. Then what will be his new expenditure? Oh, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me read the question again: \"If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" So, perhaps the question is about the percentage of his income that he spends. So, if his income increases, does his spending percentage change, or does it stay the same?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about whether his spending increases, but as a percentage, it changes. Or maybe his spending remains the same in absolute terms, so the percentage changes. Hmm. Let me think.\n\nLet's try with numbers. Let's say his original income is $100. He spends 70% of that, so $70. Now, his income increases by 20%, so it's $120. If his spending increases proportionally, his new spending would be 70% of 120, which is $84. But wait, the question is asking what his new expenditure is as a percentage. So, 84 is what percentage of his new income of 120? That's 70% again. So that would mean the percentage remains the same, but that's not one of the options except maybe if I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, but the options don't include 70%, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about his expenditure increasing by 20% as well. No, the question says his income increases by 20%, not his expenditure. Oh, wait, maybe the problem is that his spending remains the same in absolute terms, not as a percentage. So, if his income goes up by 20%, his spending is the same absolute amount, but the percentage of income spent would decrease.\n\nLet me try that. Suppose original income is $100, spends $70. Income increases by 20% to $120. His spending remains $70. So, the new percentage is 70/120 = 0.5833, which is 58.33%. Looking at the options, option A is 58.3%, which matches that. So that would be the answer.\n\nWait, but why would his spending remain the same in absolute terms? The question doesn't specify that. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" So, the wording is ambiguous. Does his spending increase proportionally with income, or does he keep his absolute spending the same?\n\nWait, in real-life scenarios, people often adjust their spending based on their income. But unless specified, the problem might assume that the proportion of income spent remains the same. So, if his income increases, his spending increases proportionally, keeping the percentage the same. But then, the percentage would still be 70%, which isn't an option. So that can't be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's expenditure is fixed, so when his income goes up, the percentage of income spent goes down. That would make sense if the problem is implying that his absolute spending doesn't change, only his income does.\n\nSo, let's go with that. Let me model it again. Let me take the original income as X. He spends 70% of X, which is 0.7X. His income increases by 20%, so new income is X + 0.2X = 1.2X. His spending remains 0.7X. So, the new percentage is (0.7X) / (1.2X) = 0.7 / 1.2 = 7/12 \u2248 0.5833, which is 58.33%. So, the answer would be option A, 58.3%.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure. The question says \"his new expenditure,\" which could mean the amount he spends, not the percentage. Hmm, the wording is confusing. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question says, \"what will be his new expenditure?\" But the options are percentages. So perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of his new income that he spends. So, in that case, if his income increases by 20%, and his spending also increases by 20%, then the percentage would remain the same. But the options don't have 70%, so that can't be the case.\n\nAlternatively, if his spending remains the same, the percentage would decrease. So, in that scenario, his new expenditure as a percentage is 58.33%, which is option A.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because the question could be interpreted in different ways. Let me think of another approach. Let's use variables.\n\nLet original income be I. Expenditure is 70% of I, so 0.7I. Income increases by 20%, so new income is I + 0.2I = 1.2I.\n\nNow, what is the new expenditure? There are two possibilities:\n\n1. His expenditure is 70% of the new income. So, 0.7 * 1.2I = 0.84I. So, his expenditure is 84% of the original income. But the question is asking for the percentage of the new income, so 84I / 120I = 0.7, 70%. But this isn't an option.\n\n2. His expenditure remains the same as before, 0.7I. So, the percentage of income spent is (0.7I) / (1.2I) = 7/12 \u2248 58.33%. So, 58.3% is option A.\n\nGiven that the options include 58.3%, I think the correct interpretation is the second scenario, where the expenditure remains the same in absolute terms, so the percentage of income spent decreases.\n\nSo, the answer should be A)58.3%.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure? The options are A to E.\n\nHmm. So I think I need to calculate his new expenditure as a percentage of his new income after the increase. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, let's consider his original income. Let's call it 'I' for simplicity. He spends 70% of this, so his expenditure is 0.7 * I. But wait, wait, that's his expenditure. But wait, the question is about his new expenditure when his income increases.\n\nWait, but do his expenses change? The problem doesn't say anything about his spending habits changing, so I think he continues to spend the same absolute amount, but as a percentage of his new income.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. Or is he spending 70% of his income, meaning his expenditure is 70% of his income. So if his income goes up, his expenditure also goes up because it's a percentage. Or wait, maybe not? Or wait, maybe the question is implying that his spending increases by the same percentage as his income? Hmm, no, the problem states that he spends 70% of his income, so that's a fixed percentage.\n\nWait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me model it with numbers to make it clearer.\n\nLet's assume his original income is $100. So 70% of that is $70 spent. Now, his income increases by 20%. So 20% of $100 is $20, making his new income $120.\n\nNow, what's his new expenditure? Since he continues to spend 70% of his income, his new expenditure would be 70% of $120. Let me calculate that: 0.7 * 120 = 84. So he's now spending $84 out of his new income of $120.\n\nBut the question asks for the new expenditure as a percentage, right? So 84 is what percentage of 120? Let me compute that. (84 / 120) * 100 = ?\n\nWait, 84 divided by 120. Let me calculate that: 84 \u00f7 120 = 0.7. So 0.7 * 100 is 70%. Wait, that's the same as before. But none of the options is 70%. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Oh no, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me read it again. \"A man spends 70% of his income.\" Oh wait, perhaps that's his expenditure. So if his income increases, what's his new expenditure as a percentage of the new income? Or is the 70% fixed, so his absolute expenditure increases but as a percentage of income, it's still 70%? But in that case, the answer would be 70%, which isn't an option. Hmm. So perhaps I've made a wrong assumption.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that his expenditure is a fixed amount, not a percentage. Let me think again. Oh wait, the problem says he spends 70% of his income. So if his income increases, his expenditure also increases because it's a percentage. So, for example, if income increases, so does his spending, but the percentage remains 70%.\n\nWait, but in the example I used, when income went from 100 to 120, his spending went from 70 to 84, which is still 70% of income. So in that case, the percentage remains 70%, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for his expenditure in absolute terms, but then the options are percentages, so that can't be. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've misread the problem. Let me read it again. Oh! Wait, the question says his income increases by 20%, but does it say that his expenditure increases by the same percentage? No, it just says his income increases, and we're to find his new expenditure as a percentage of his new income.\n\nWait, so in my earlier example, the answer would be 70%, which isn't an option. So perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that he spends 70% of his income, and then his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by some amount, not necessarily the same percentage. Wait, but the problem doesn't state that his expenditure increases by any percentage, only that his income increases by 20%. So, perhaps his expenditure as a percentage of the new income is 70% again. But that's not in the options.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me denote his original income as I.\n\nHe spends 70% of I, so his expenditure is 0.7 I.\n\nHis income increases by 20%, so new income is I + 0.2 I = 1.2 I.\n\nAssuming his spending remains the same, but wait, the problem says he spends 70% of his income, so if his income changes, his spending would also change proportionally. So if his income is now 1.2 I, then his new expenditure would be 0.7 * 1.2 I = 0.84 I.\n\nBut the question is asking for his new expenditure as a percentage of his new income. So (0.84 I) / (1.2 I) = 0.7, so 70%. Again, 70% isn't an option. So perhaps the problem is phrased differently.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure doesn't increase by the same percentage. Maybe he continues to spend the same amount as before. But that's not what the problem says.\n\nWait, the problem says he spends 70% of his income, so if his income increases, his expenditure also increases, but the percentage is the same. So the percentage remains 70%, but the options don't have 70%, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the change in his expenditure as a percentage of the original income, but that doesn't make much sense. Let me think.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the 70% is his expenditure, but when his income increases, his absolute expenditure increases, but as a percentage of the new income, it's lower.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 70% is a fixed percentage. So if income increases, his expenditure would also increase by the same percentage.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me try with different numbers.\n\nSuppose his original income is $200. He spends 70% of that, which is $140.\n\nHis income increases by 20%, so new income is $240.\n\nNow, if he continues to spend 70% of his income, his new expenditure is 70% of 240, which is $168.\n\nSo as a percentage of new income, it's 168/240 = 0.7, so 70% again. So the percentage remains the same. So the answer should be 70%, which is not in the options. So perhaps the problem is that his expenditure is a fixed amount, not a percentage of income.\n\nWait, that would make more sense. Let me try that.\n\nAssume his original income is I, and he spends 70% of it, so expenditure is 0.7 I.\n\nNow, his income increases by 20%, so new income is 1.2 I.\n\nIf his expenditure remains the same, then his new expenditure as a percentage of the new income would be (0.7 I) / (1.2 I) = 0.7 / 1.2 = 0.583333..., which is approximately 58.333%.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 58.3%, which would fit. So this suggests that the answer is A) 58.3%.\n\nBut wait, the question says he spends 70% of his income. So if his income increases, his expenditure would also increase if he continues to spend 70% of his income. But in this scenario, I assumed his expenditure remains the same absolute amount, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nSo I'm a bit confused now. The problem states that he spends 70% of his income. So when income increases, his expenditure should also increase by 20% as a fixed percentage. Or does it?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me think again.\n\nIf he spends 70% of his income, that's a percentage. So if his income increases, his spending increases proportionally. So his new expenditure is 70% of the new income. So the percentage remains 70%, but his absolute spending increases.\n\nBut according to the options, that's not an option. So perhaps the problem is that the man's expenditure is a fixed amount, not a percentage. So if his income increases by 20%, his expenditure as a percentage of income decreases.\n\nWait, but the problem says he spends 70% of his income, which implies that the percentage is fixed. So I'm getting conflicting possibilities here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is phrased in a way that when his income increases by 20%, his expenditure also increases by 20%. But that's not what the problem states.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about the change in his expenditure as a percentage of his original income, not the new income. But that's not the question.\n\nHmm. Let me try to approach it algebraically.\n\nLet me denote his original income as I.\n\nOriginal expenditure: E = 0.7 I.\n\nIncome increases by 20%, so new income I' = I + 0.2 I = 1.2 I.\n\nAssuming his expenditure as a percentage of income remains the same, then new expenditure E' = 0.7 I' = 0.7 * 1.2 I = 0.84 I.\n\nBut the problem doesn't say anything about his spending habits changing. So his expenditure would now be 0.84 I, which is 70% of 1.2 I, so 70% again. So the percentage remains 70%.\n\nBut since that's not an option, perhaps I've made a wrong assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's expenditure increases by 20%, but that's not stated.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that his income increases, but his expenditure remains the same absolute amount, so his spending as a percentage of income decreases.\n\nSo in that case, his original expenditure is 0.7 I. After income increases by 20%, new income is 1.2 I. His expenditure is still 0.7 I, so the new percentage is (0.7 I) / (1.2 I) = 7/12 \u2248 0.5833, which is 58.333%, so option A.\n\nBut this contradicts the problem statement, which says he continues to spend 70% of his income. So I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Let me re-examine the question.\n\nThe question says: \"A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\"\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that he continues to spend the same amount as before, which was 70% of his original income. So his expenditure remains 0.7 I, but his income increases to 1.2 I. So his new expenditure as a percentage is (0.7 I) / (1.2 I) = 0.583333, which is 58.333%, option A.\n\nBut this would mean that he is now spending less percentage of his income, which is possible if his income increases but his expenditure doesn't increase proportionally. But according to the problem statement, he spends 70% of his income, which would mean that his expenditure would increase to 70% of the new income.\n\nSo I'm getting conflicting interpretations. Let me think of the two possibilities.\n\nPossibility 1: He continues to spend 70% of his income, so when income increases, expenditure increases as 70% of the new income. So percentage remains 70%, not in options.\n\nPossibility 2: His expenditure is fixed at 70% of his original income, so when income increases, the percentage decreases. So 70% of original income is his expenditure, and when income increases by 20%, his new income is 120, so 70% of 100 is 70, which is 70/120 = 58.333%.\n\nWhich is option A.\n\nBut the problem says he spends 70% of his income. So if his income increases, he would spend 70% of the new income, which is higher than before. So the percentage remains the same.\n\nBut since the options don't have 70%, perhaps the problem is that the man's expenditure doesn't change, but his income does. So the percentage would drop.\n\nBut the problem says he spends 70% of his income, which would imply that his expenditure is tied to his income. So when income increases, so does expenditure.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let me look for another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about his expenditure as a percentage of his original income. But that's not what's asked.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is phrased as his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure remains the same as a fixed amount. Then, his new expenditure as a percentage of the new income would be lower.\n\nSo, let's compute that.\n\nOriginal income: I\n\nExpenditure: 0.7 I\n\nIncome increases by 20%: new income = 1.2 I\n\nExpenditure remains same: 0.7 I\n\nSo new percentage: (0.7 I) / (1.2 I) = 7/12 = approximately 58.333%, which is option A.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, he continues to spend 70% of his income. So if his income increases, his expenditure would be 70% of the new income, which is higher than before.\n\nSo why is the answer 58.3%? Unless the problem is that he continues to spend the same amount, which would be 70% of his original income.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that he had an income of, say, 100, and spent 70. Now, his income increases by 20%, so 120. But he continues to spend 70, so the percentage is 70/120 = 58.333%.\n\nBut the problem says he spends 70% of his income. So that would mean that if his income is 120, he would now spend 84, which is 70% of 120. So the percentage remains the same.\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer is 70%, but that's not an option. So I must have made a wrong assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's interpretation. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question is: A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking about the new expenditure as a percentage of his original income, not the new income. But that seems unlikely.\n\nIn that case, new expenditure is 0.7 * 1.2 I = 0.84 I, so 84% of original income. But the options don't have 84% either.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage increase in his expenditure. So from 70 to 84, an increase of 14, which is a 20% increase (since 14/70 = 0.2). So his expenditure increases by 20%, but the question isn't asking for that.\n\nWait, but the question is about the new expenditure as a percentage. So perhaps it's 70% again, but that's not an option. So I'm stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by a certain percentage, not as a fixed percentage. But the problem doesn't state that.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that his expenditure is 70% of his income. Maybe he spends 70% of his income on something, but his income increases, so his expenditure also increases, but perhaps the way it's phrased is that his expenditure is now a different percentage.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as a percentage of his original income.\n\nWait, no. The problem states that his income increases by 20%, so the new income is 120% of the original. But the percentage of expenditure is based on the new income.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by a certain amount, not a percentage. But the problem doesn't state that.\n\nI'm getting stuck here because I can't reconcile the options with the problem statement. The only way I get an option that's present is if the expenditure remains the same as a fixed amount, which would make the new percentage 58.3%, option A. But according to the problem statement, he spends 70% of his income, implying that the percentage remains the same.\n\nPerhaps the problem is worded ambiguously. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: Let's denote the original income as 100 units. So his expenditure is 70 units.\n\nNow, his income increases by 20%, so new income is 120.\n\nAssuming he continues to spend 70% of his income, his new expenditure is 70% of 120 = 84.\n\nSo his new expenditure is 84, which as a percentage of his new income (120) is 70%. But since that's not an option, perhaps the problem is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the original income.\n\nSo 84 / 100 = 84%, but that's not an option either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the increase in expenditure as a percentage of the original income. So 84 -70=14. 14/100=14%, but that's not an option.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when his income increases by 20%, his expenditure increases by 20%, so his new expenditure is 70 *1.2 =84. Then, as a percentage of the new income (120), it's 84/120=70%, which again isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that his income increases by 20%, so his expenditure as a percentage of his new income remains the same. But that brings us back to 70%, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me try to compute it using variables.\n\nLet original income be I.\n\nExpenditure = 0.7 I.\n\nAfter 20% increase, new income = 1.2 I.\n\nIf expenditure remains the same, then new expenditure percentage = (0.7 I) / (1.2 I) = 7/12 \u2248 58.333%, which is option A.\n\nBut this would mean that his expenditure as a percentage of income decreases, which would be the case only if his expenditure doesn't increase with his income, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nBut according to the problem, he spends 70% of his income, which suggests that his expenditure increases when income increases. So this approach would be wrong.\n\nI'm getting stuck. Let me think of another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the man's expenditure as a percentage of his original income. So his new income is 120, but his expenditure is 70% of that, which is 84. So 84 is what percentage of his original income (100)? It's 84%, but that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the change in his saving, but the problem doesn't mention savings.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of absolute values and then find the percentage. Let me think.\n\nLet me take his original income as 100. So he spends 70, saves 30.\n\nHis income increases by 20%, so new income is 120.\n\nIf his spending remains 70, then his new expenditure is 70, which is 70/120 \u2248 58.333%, option A.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, he spends 70% of his income. So when his income is 120, he would spend 70% of that, which is 84. So the percentage is 70%, which is not an option.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is that he continues to spend the same amount as before, 70, but his income is now 120. So his new expenditure is 70/120 = 58.333%.\n\nBut the problem says he spends 70% of his income, which would imply that he spends more as his income increases. So perhaps the problem is worded differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by a certain amount, not necessarily 20%. But the problem doesn't state that.\n\nI'm really stuck here. The only way I can get an option that's listed is if the expenditure remains the same, which would make the percentage 58.333%, option A. But according to the problem statement, that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the 70% is of his original income, and the increase is applied to that. Wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the new expenditure as 70% of the increased income. So let's model that.\n\nOriginal income: I.\n\nExpenditure: 0.7 I.\n\nNew income: 1.2 I.\n\nNew expenditure: 0.7 * 1.2 I = 0.84 I.\n\nSo new expenditure is 84% of original income. But the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income, which would be 70%. So that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure also increases by 20%, so his new expenditure is 70 * 1.2 =84, which is 84/120 =70% of new income.\n\nBut again, 70% isn't an option.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. Let me think of another angle.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that his expenditure increases by 20%, but that's not stated. So original expenditure is 70, new expenditure is 84. So as a percentage of new income (120), it's 70%, which is not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that his expenditure increases by 14 (from 70 to 84), which is a 20% increase in expenditure. But the question isn't asking about that.\n\nI'm not making progress here. Let me try to see which option fits the scenario where expenditure is the same absolute value.\n\nIf the answer is A)58.3%, then the new expenditure is 58.3% of the new income. Which would be the case if the man's expenditure remains the same as before (70% of original income). So perhaps that's the intended approach.\n\nSo, in that case, the correct answer would be A)58.3%.\n\nBut I'm still not confident because the problem states that he spends 70% of his income, implying that his expenditure is tied to his income.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure also increases by 20% of his original income. So original expenditure is 70, increase by 20% of 70 is 14, so new expenditure is 84. Then, new income is 120, so 84/120 =70%. Again, not an option.\n\nI think I'm going in circles here. Based on the options given, the only scenario that fits is when the expenditure remains the same, leading to option A. But according to the problem statement, that's not the case. So perhaps the problem intended that approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me try once more.\n\nLet me take his original income as 100, so his expenditure is 70. His income increases by 20% to 120.\n\nIf his expenditure increases by the same 20%, then new expenditure is 70 *1.2=84. So as a percentage of new income, 84/120=70%. So no change.\n\nBut if his expenditure doesn't increase, remains at 70, then 70/120=58.333%.\n\nSo the answer depends on whether his expenditure increases proportionally or remains the same.\n\nThe problem states that he spends 70% of his income, so his expenditure is tied to his income. So his expenditure should increase to 70% of the new income, leading to 70% again.\n\nBut since that's not an option, perhaps the problem is phrased incorrectly, or I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that his income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by 20% of his original income. So original expenditure is 70. Increase by 20% of 70 is 14, so new expenditure is 84. New income is 120. So 84/120=70% again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that his expenditure increases by 20%, so new expenditure is 70 *1.2=84, which is 70% of new income.\n\nBut again, 70% isn't an option.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Given the options, the only way to get an answer that's listed is option A, 58.3%, which would be the case if his expenditure remains the same as a fixed amount, but that contradicts the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by 10%, or some other percentage, but that's not stated.\n\nIn conclusion, the problem is ambiguous, but based on the given options, the correct approach is to assume that the man's expenditure remains the same, leading to option A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves a man who spends 70% of his income. When his income increases by 20%, the task is to determine his new expenditure as a percentage of his new income. The analysis proceeds as follows:\n\n1. **Original Income and Expenditure**:  \n   Let the original income be denoted as \\( I \\). The man spends 70% of his income, so his original expenditure is \\( 0.7I \\).\n\n2. **New Income**:  \n   After a 20% increase in income, the new income becomes \\( 1.2I \\).\n\n3. **Interpretation of Expenditure**:  \n   The problem states that the man spends 70% of his income. This implies that his expenditure is tied to his income. Therefore, if his income increases, his expenditure should also increase proportionally to maintain the 70% spending rate.\n\n4. **New Expenditure Calculation**:  \n   If the man continues to spend 70% of his income, his new expenditure is \\( 0.7 \\times 1.2I = 0.84I \\). As a percentage of his new income (\\( 1.2I \\)), this is:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{0.84I}{1.2I} = 0.7 = 70\\%.\n   \\]  \n   However, 70% is not among the provided options.\n\n5. **Alternative Interpretation**:  \n   If the man's expenditure remains constant at \\( 0.7I \\) (i.e., he does not adjust his spending with the income increase), then his new expenditure as a percentage of his new income is:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{0.7I}{1.2I} = \\frac{7}{12} \\approx 0.5833 = 58.3\\%.\n   \\]  \n   This matches option A.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:  \n   While the problem suggests that the man spends 70% of his income, the lack of 70% as an option implies that the intended interpretation is that his expenditure remains constant, and the percentage is recalculated based on the new income. This leads to the answer \\( 58.3\\% \\).\n\nAnswer: A",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure? The options are A to E.\n\nHmm. So I think I need to calculate his new expenditure as a percentage of his new income after the increase. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, let's consider his original income. Let's call it 'I' for simplicity. He spends 70% of this, so his expenditure is 0.7 * I. But wait, wait, that's his expenditure. But wait, the question is about his new expenditure when his income increases.\n\nWait, but do his expenses change? The problem doesn't say anything about his spending habits changing, so I think he continues to spend the same absolute amount, but as a percentage of his new income.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. Or is he spending 70% of his income, meaning his expenditure is 70% of his income. So if his income goes up, his expenditure also goes up because it's a percentage. Or wait, maybe not? Or wait, maybe the question is implying that his spending increases by the same percentage as his income? Hmm, no, the problem states that he spends 70% of his income, so that's a fixed percentage.\n\nWait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me model it with numbers to make it clearer.\n\nLet's assume his original income is $100. So 70% of that is $70 spent. Now, his income increases by 20%. So 20% of $100 is $20, making his new income $120.\n\nNow, what's his new expenditure? Since he continues to spend 70% of his income, his new expenditure would be 70% of $120. Let me calculate that: 0.7 * 120 = 84. So he's now spending $84 out of his new income of $120.\n\nBut the question asks for the new expenditure as a percentage, right? So 84 is what percentage of 120? Let me compute that. (84 / 120) * 100 = ?\n\nWait, 84 divided by 120. Let me calculate that: 84 \u00f7 120 = 0.7. So 0.7 * 100 is 70%. Wait, that's the same as before. But none of the options is 70%. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Oh no, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me read it again. \"A man spends 70% of his income.\" Oh wait, perhaps that's his expenditure. So if his income increases, what's his new expenditure as a percentage of the new income? Or is the 70% fixed, so his absolute expenditure increases but as a percentage of income, it's still 70%? But in that case, the answer would be 70%, which isn't an option. Hmm. So perhaps I've made a wrong assumption.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that his expenditure is a fixed amount, not a percentage. Let me think again. Oh wait, the problem says he spends 70% of his income. So if his income increases, his expenditure also increases because it's a percentage. So, for example, if income increases, so does his spending, but the percentage remains 70%.\n\nWait, but in the example I used, when income went from 100 to 120, his spending went from 70 to 84, which is still 70% of income. So in that case, the percentage remains 70%, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for his expenditure in absolute terms, but then the options are percentages, so that can't be. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've misread the problem. Let me read it again. Oh! Wait, the question says his income increases by 20%, but does it say that his expenditure increases by the same percentage? No, it just says his income increases, and we're to find his new expenditure as a percentage of his new income.\n\nWait, so in my earlier example, the answer would be 70%, which isn't an option. So perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that he spends 70% of his income, and then his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by some amount, not necessarily the same percentage. Wait, but the problem doesn't state that his expenditure increases by any percentage, only that his income increases by 20%. So, perhaps his expenditure as a percentage of the new income is 70% again. But that's not in the options.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me denote his original income as I.\n\nHe spends 70% of I, so his expenditure is 0.7 I.\n\nHis income increases by 20%, so new income is I + 0.2 I = 1.2 I.\n\nAssuming his spending remains the same, but wait, the problem says he spends 70% of his income, so if his income changes, his spending would also change proportionally. So if his income is now 1.2 I, then his new expenditure would be 0.7 * 1.2 I = 0.84 I.\n\nBut the question is asking for his new expenditure as a percentage of his new income. So (0.84 I) / (1.2 I) = 0.7, so 70%. Again, 70% isn't an option. So perhaps the problem is phrased differently.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure doesn't increase by the same percentage. Maybe he continues to spend the same amount as before. But that's not what the problem says.\n\nWait, the problem says he spends 70% of his income, so if his income increases, his expenditure also increases, but the percentage is the same. So the percentage remains 70%, but the options don't have 70%, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the change in his expenditure as a percentage of the original income, but that doesn't make much sense. Let me think.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the 70% is his expenditure, but when his income increases, his absolute expenditure increases, but as a percentage of the new income, it's lower.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 70% is a fixed percentage. So if income increases, his expenditure would also increase by the same percentage.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me try with different numbers.\n\nSuppose his original income is $200. He spends 70% of that, which is $140.\n\nHis income increases by 20%, so new income is $240.\n\nNow, if he continues to spend 70% of his income, his new expenditure is 70% of 240, which is $168.\n\nSo as a percentage of new income, it's 168/240 = 0.7, so 70% again. So the percentage remains the same. So the answer should be 70%, which is not in the options. So perhaps the problem is that his expenditure is a fixed amount, not a percentage of income.\n\nWait, that would make more sense. Let me try that.\n\nAssume his original income is I, and he spends 70% of it, so expenditure is 0.7 I.\n\nNow, his income increases by 20%, so new income is 1.2 I.\n\nIf his expenditure remains the same, then his new expenditure as a percentage of the new income would be (0.7 I) / (1.2 I) = 0.7 / 1.2 = 0.583333..., which is approximately 58.333%.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 58.3%, which would fit. So this suggests that the answer is A) 58.3%.\n\nBut wait, the question says he spends 70% of his income. So if his income increases, his expenditure would also increase if he continues to spend 70% of his income. But in this scenario, I assumed his expenditure remains the same absolute amount, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nSo I'm a bit confused now. The problem states that he spends 70% of his income. So when income increases, his expenditure should also increase by 20% as a fixed percentage. Or does it?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me think again.\n\nIf he spends 70% of his income, that's a percentage. So if his income increases, his spending increases proportionally. So his new expenditure is 70% of the new income. So the percentage remains 70%, but his absolute spending increases.\n\nBut according to the options, that's not an option. So perhaps the problem is that the man's expenditure is a fixed amount, not a percentage. So if his income increases by 20%, his expenditure as a percentage of income decreases.\n\nWait, but the problem says he spends 70% of his income, which implies that the percentage is fixed. So I'm getting conflicting possibilities here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is phrased in a way that when his income increases by 20%, his expenditure also increases by 20%. But that's not what the problem states.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about the change in his expenditure as a percentage of his original income, not the new income. But that's not the question.\n\nHmm. Let me try to approach it algebraically.\n\nLet me denote his original income as I.\n\nOriginal expenditure: E = 0.7 I.\n\nIncome increases by 20%, so new income I' = I + 0.2 I = 1.2 I.\n\nAssuming his expenditure as a percentage of income remains the same, then new expenditure E' = 0.7 I' = 0.7 * 1.2 I = 0.84 I.\n\nBut the problem doesn't say anything about his spending habits changing. So his expenditure would now be 0.84 I, which is 70% of 1.2 I, so 70% again. So the percentage remains 70%.\n\nBut since that's not an option, perhaps I've made a wrong assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's expenditure increases by 20%, but that's not stated.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that his income increases, but his expenditure remains the same absolute amount, so his spending as a percentage of income decreases.\n\nSo in that case, his original expenditure is 0.7 I. After income increases by 20%, new income is 1.2 I. His expenditure is still 0.7 I, so the new percentage is (0.7 I) / (1.2 I) = 7/12 \u2248 0.5833, which is 58.333%, so option A.\n\nBut this contradicts the problem statement, which says he continues to spend 70% of his income. So I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Let me re-examine the question.\n\nThe question says: \"A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\"\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that he continues to spend the same amount as before, which was 70% of his original income. So his expenditure remains 0.7 I, but his income increases to 1.2 I. So his new expenditure as a percentage is (0.7 I) / (1.2 I) = 0.583333, which is 58.333%, option A.\n\nBut this would mean that he is now spending less percentage of his income, which is possible if his income increases but his expenditure doesn't increase proportionally. But according to the problem statement, he spends 70% of his income, which would mean that his expenditure would increase to 70% of the new income.\n\nSo I'm getting conflicting interpretations. Let me think of the two possibilities.\n\nPossibility 1: He continues to spend 70% of his income, so when income increases, expenditure increases as 70% of the new income. So percentage remains 70%, not in options.\n\nPossibility 2: His expenditure is fixed at 70% of his original income, so when income increases, the percentage decreases. So 70% of original income is his expenditure, and when income increases by 20%, his new income is 120, so 70% of 100 is 70, which is 70/120 = 58.333%.\n\nWhich is option A.\n\nBut the problem says he spends 70% of his income. So if his income increases, he would spend 70% of the new income, which is higher than before. So the percentage remains the same.\n\nBut since the options don't have 70%, perhaps the problem is that the man's expenditure doesn't change, but his income does. So the percentage would drop.\n\nBut the problem says he spends 70% of his income, which would imply that his expenditure is tied to his income. So when income increases, so does expenditure.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let me look for another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about his expenditure as a percentage of his original income. But that's not what's asked.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is phrased as his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure remains the same as a fixed amount. Then, his new expenditure as a percentage of the new income would be lower.\n\nSo, let's compute that.\n\nOriginal income: I\n\nExpenditure: 0.7 I\n\nIncome increases by 20%: new income = 1.2 I\n\nExpenditure remains same: 0.7 I\n\nSo new percentage: (0.7 I) / (1.2 I) = 7/12 = approximately 58.333%, which is option A.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, he continues to spend 70% of his income. So if his income increases, his expenditure would be 70% of the new income, which is higher than before.\n\nSo why is the answer 58.3%? Unless the problem is that he continues to spend the same amount, which would be 70% of his original income.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that he had an income of, say, 100, and spent 70. Now, his income increases by 20%, so 120. But he continues to spend 70, so the percentage is 70/120 = 58.333%.\n\nBut the problem says he spends 70% of his income. So that would mean that if his income is 120, he would now spend 84, which is 70% of 120. So the percentage remains the same.\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer is 70%, but that's not an option. So I must have made a wrong assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's interpretation. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question is: A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking about the new expenditure as a percentage of his original income, not the new income. But that seems unlikely.\n\nIn that case, new expenditure is 0.7 * 1.2 I = 0.84 I, so 84% of original income. But the options don't have 84% either.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage increase in his expenditure. So from 70 to 84, an increase of 14, which is a 20% increase (since 14/70 = 0.2). So his expenditure increases by 20%, but the question isn't asking for that.\n\nWait, but the question is about the new expenditure as a percentage. So perhaps it's 70% again, but that's not an option. So I'm stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by a certain percentage, not as a fixed percentage. But the problem doesn't state that.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that his expenditure is 70% of his income. Maybe he spends 70% of his income on something, but his income increases, so his expenditure also increases, but perhaps the way it's phrased is that his expenditure is now a different percentage.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as a percentage of his original income.\n\nWait, no. The problem states that his income increases by 20%, so the new income is 120% of the original. But the percentage of expenditure is based on the new income.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by a certain amount, not a percentage. But the problem doesn't state that.\n\nI'm getting stuck here because I can't reconcile the options with the problem statement. The only way I get an option that's present is if the expenditure remains the same as a fixed amount, which would make the new percentage 58.3%, option A. But according to the problem statement, he spends 70% of his income, implying that the percentage remains the same.\n\nPerhaps the problem is worded ambiguously. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: Let's denote the original income as 100 units. So his expenditure is 70 units.\n\nNow, his income increases by 20%, so new income is 120.\n\nAssuming he continues to spend 70% of his income, his new expenditure is 70% of 120 = 84.\n\nSo his new expenditure is 84, which as a percentage of his new income (120) is 70%. But since that's not an option, perhaps the problem is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the original income.\n\nSo 84 / 100 = 84%, but that's not an option either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the increase in expenditure as a percentage of the original income. So 84 -70=14. 14/100=14%, but that's not an option.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when his income increases by 20%, his expenditure increases by 20%, so his new expenditure is 70 *1.2 =84. Then, as a percentage of the new income (120), it's 84/120=70%, which again isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that his income increases by 20%, so his expenditure as a percentage of his new income remains the same. But that brings us back to 70%, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me try to compute it using variables.\n\nLet original income be I.\n\nExpenditure = 0.7 I.\n\nAfter 20% increase, new income = 1.2 I.\n\nIf expenditure remains the same, then new expenditure percentage = (0.7 I) / (1.2 I) = 7/12 \u2248 58.333%, which is option A.\n\nBut this would mean that his expenditure as a percentage of income decreases, which would be the case only if his expenditure doesn't increase with his income, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nBut according to the problem, he spends 70% of his income, which suggests that his expenditure increases when income increases. So this approach would be wrong.\n\nI'm getting stuck. Let me think of another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the man's expenditure as a percentage of his original income. So his new income is 120, but his expenditure is 70% of that, which is 84. So 84 is what percentage of his original income (100)? It's 84%, but that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the change in his saving, but the problem doesn't mention savings.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of absolute values and then find the percentage. Let me think.\n\nLet me take his original income as 100. So he spends 70, saves 30.\n\nHis income increases by 20%, so new income is 120.\n\nIf his spending remains 70, then his new expenditure is 70, which is 70/120 \u2248 58.333%, option A.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, he spends 70% of his income. So when his income is 120, he would spend 70% of that, which is 84. So the percentage is 70%, which is not an option.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is that he continues to spend the same amount as before, 70, but his income is now 120. So his new expenditure is 70/120 = 58.333%.\n\nBut the problem says he spends 70% of his income, which would imply that he spends more as his income increases. So perhaps the problem is worded differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by a certain amount, not necessarily 20%. But the problem doesn't state that.\n\nI'm really stuck here. The only way I can get an option that's listed is if the expenditure remains the same, which would make the percentage 58.333%, option A. But according to the problem statement, that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the 70% is of his original income, and the increase is applied to that. Wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the new expenditure as 70% of the increased income. So let's model that.\n\nOriginal income: I.\n\nExpenditure: 0.7 I.\n\nNew income: 1.2 I.\n\nNew expenditure: 0.7 * 1.2 I = 0.84 I.\n\nSo new expenditure is 84% of original income. But the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income, which would be 70%. So that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure also increases by 20%, so his new expenditure is 70 * 1.2 =84, which is 84/120 =70% of new income.\n\nBut again, 70% isn't an option.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. Let me think of another angle.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that his expenditure increases by 20%, but that's not stated. So original expenditure is 70, new expenditure is 84. So as a percentage of new income (120), it's 70%, which is not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that his expenditure increases by 14 (from 70 to 84), which is a 20% increase in expenditure. But the question isn't asking about that.\n\nI'm not making progress here. Let me try to see which option fits the scenario where expenditure is the same absolute value.\n\nIf the answer is A)58.3%, then the new expenditure is 58.3% of the new income. Which would be the case if the man's expenditure remains the same as before (70% of original income). So perhaps that's the intended approach.\n\nSo, in that case, the correct answer would be A)58.3%.\n\nBut I'm still not confident because the problem states that he spends 70% of his income, implying that his expenditure is tied to his income.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure also increases by 20% of his original income. So original expenditure is 70, increase by 20% of 70 is 14, so new expenditure is 84. Then, new income is 120, so 84/120 =70%. Again, not an option.\n\nI think I'm going in circles here. Based on the options given, the only scenario that fits is when the expenditure remains the same, leading to option A. But according to the problem statement, that's not the case. So perhaps the problem intended that approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me try once more.\n\nLet me take his original income as 100, so his expenditure is 70. His income increases by 20% to 120.\n\nIf his expenditure increases by the same 20%, then new expenditure is 70 *1.2=84. So as a percentage of new income, 84/120=70%. So no change.\n\nBut if his expenditure doesn't increase, remains at 70, then 70/120=58.333%.\n\nSo the answer depends on whether his expenditure increases proportionally or remains the same.\n\nThe problem states that he spends 70% of his income, so his expenditure is tied to his income. So his expenditure should increase to 70% of the new income, leading to 70% again.\n\nBut since that's not an option, perhaps the problem is phrased incorrectly, or I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that his income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by 20% of his original income. So original expenditure is 70. Increase by 20% of 70 is 14, so new expenditure is 84. New income is 120. So 84/120=70% again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that his expenditure increases by 20%, so new expenditure is 70 *1.2=84, which is 70% of new income.\n\nBut again, 70% isn't an option.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Given the options, the only way to get an answer that's listed is option A, 58.3%, which would be the case if his expenditure remains the same as a fixed amount, but that contradicts the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by 10%, or some other percentage, but that's not stated.\n\nIn conclusion, the problem is ambiguous, but based on the given options, the correct approach is to assume that the man's expenditure remains the same, leading to option A.\n\n\nThe problem involves a man who spends 70% of his income. When his income increases by 20%, the task is to determine his new expenditure as a percentage of his new income. The analysis proceeds as follows:\n\n1. **Original Income and Expenditure**:  \n   Let the original income be denoted as \\( I \\). The man spends 70% of his income, so his original expenditure is \\( 0.7I \\).\n\n2. **New Income**:  \n   After a 20% increase in income, the new income becomes \\( 1.2I \\).\n\n3. **Interpretation of Expenditure**:  \n   The problem states that the man spends 70% of his income. This implies that his expenditure is tied to his income. Therefore, if his income increases, his expenditure should also increase proportionally to maintain the 70% spending rate.\n\n4. **New Expenditure Calculation**:  \n   If the man continues to spend 70% of his income, his new expenditure is \\( 0.7 \\times 1.2I = 0.84I \\). As a percentage of his new income (\\( 1.2I \\)), this is:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{0.84I}{1.2I} = 0.7 = 70\\%.\n   \\]  \n   However, 70% is not among the provided options.\n\n5. **Alternative Interpretation**:  \n   If the man's expenditure remains constant at \\( 0.7I \\) (i.e., he does not adjust his spending with the income increase), then his new expenditure as a percentage of his new income is:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{0.7I}{1.2I} = \\frac{7}{12} \\approx 0.5833 = 58.3\\%.\n   \\]  \n   This matches option A.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:  \n   While the problem suggests that the man spends 70% of his income, the lack of 70% as an option implies that the intended interpretation is that his expenditure remains constant, and the percentage is recalculated based on the new income. This leads to the answer \\( 58.3\\% \\).\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again. A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure? The options are A to E, with various percentages. Hmm.\n\nAlright, so let's break this down. I think the key is to figure out how his expenditure changes when his income goes up by 20%. Wait, but does his expenditure also increase by the same percentage? Or does it stay the same in absolute terms? Oh wait, no, because he's spending a certain percentage of his income each time. So if his income increases, his expenditure as a percentage might change.\n\nWait, no, no. Wait, the question says he spends 70% of his income. So initially, let's say his income is I. So his expenditure is 0.7 * I. Then his income increases by 20%, so new income is I + 20% of I, which is 1.2 * I. Now, the question is, does his expenditure also increase by 20%? Or does he continue to spend the same percentage of his new income?\n\nWait, the way the problem is phrased, I think he continues to spend 70% of his new income. Because the question is about his expenditure as a percentage of his income after the increase. Wait, no, wait. The original statement says he spends 70% of his income. So that's his spending rate. So when his income changes, his expenditure would be 70% of the new income. Or wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that his expenditure is a fixed amount, but that's unlikely. Because the question is about percentages, so it's more likely that his spending rate is 70%, and when his income changes, his spending is adjusted accordingly.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Let me take an example. Let's say his initial income is $100. Then he spends 70% of that, which is $70. Now, his income increases by 20%, so new income is $120. Now, what is his new expenditure? If he continues to spend 70% of his income, then it's 70% of 120, which is $84. So what's the percentage of his new income? 84/120 is 0.7, so 70%. But that's not one of the options. Wait, that can't be right because none of the options are 70%. So maybe I'm getting the question wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that his expenditure is fixed, and when his income increases, the percentage changes. So, for example, he's spending a fixed amount, say $70, regardless of his income. Then, if his income increases to $120, the percentage of his income that he's spending would decrease.\n\nWait, that's a different scenario. So let's model both possibilities.\n\nFirst scenario: His spending is a percentage of income. So if income increases, spending as a percentage of income stays the same. Then the answer is 70%, which isn't in the options. So that's not it.\n\nSecond scenario: His spending is a fixed amount, so when income increases, the percentage of income that he spends decreases. So let's model that.\n\nLet me think. Let me define variables.\n\nLet initial income be I. He spends S, which is 70% of I. So S = 0.7 * I.\n\nThen his income increases by 20%, so new income I' = I + 0.2 I = 1.2 I.\n\nHis spending S remains the same, assuming that his expenditure is a fixed amount. So the new percentage of income spent is S / I' = (0.7 I) / (1.2 I) = 0.7 / 1.2 = 7/12 \u2248 0.583333. So that's 58.333...%, which is approximately 58.3%.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 58.3%. So that would be the answer.\n\nWait, but why would his spending remain the same? Because the question states that he spends 70% of his income. So in the original situation, if his income increases, he continues to spend 70% of his new income. So why would the percentage change? Oh wait, no, that's not matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me re-read the question.\n\nThe question says: A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\n\nWait, the question is about his new expenditure, not the percentage. So perhaps the question is, does his expenditure (the amount) increase by 20% as well, making his new expenditure 70% + 20% of 70%? No, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIf his income increases by 20%, and he continues to spend 70% of his income, then his expenditure increases by 20% as well.\n\nWait, let's calculate.\n\nInitial income: I\n\nExpenditure: 0.7 I\n\nAfter 20% increase, income is 1.2 I.\n\nExpenditure: 0.7 * 1.2 I = 0.84 I.\n\nSo his expenditure is now 0.84 I, which is an increase of 0.14 I (from 0.7 I), which is a 20% increase in expenditure as well.\n\nBut the question is, what is his new expenditure? If the question is asking for the amount, then it's 0.84 I, but the options are percentages, so maybe it's referring to the percentage of his new income.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The question is: \"what will be his new expenditure?\" So perhaps the question is asking what percentage of his income he now spends after the increase. Or is it asking for the amount of expenditure, not the percentage.\n\nWait, no, the options are in percentages. So perhaps the question is, what percentage of his new income is his expenditure?\n\nWait, but that would be 70% again. Because he's still spending 70% of his income. So that can't be.\n\nWait, maybe the question is phrased differently. Perhaps he has a fixed expenditure, and his income increases. So his expenditure as a percentage of income decreases.\n\nWait, but the problem states that he spends 70% of his income. So when his income increases, his expenditure would be 70% of the new income. So the percentage remains 70%.\n\nBut that's not an option, so I must be misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that he has a fixed expenditure, and when his income increases, the percentage of income he spends decreases.\n\nWait, but the initial statement says he spends 70% of his income. So that suggests that when his income changes, his expenditure adjusts to 70% of the new income.\n\nWait, but let's try another approach.\n\nLet me take the first approach again.\n\nSuppose initial income is 100 units. He spends 70 units.\n\nAfter a 20% increase, income is 120 units.\n\nIf he continues to spend 70% of his income, then he now spends 84 units. So his expenditure increases by 14 units, which is 20% of 70.\n\nBut the question is, what is his new expenditure? If they are asking for the amount, it's 84, but if they are asking for the percentage of income, it's 70% (84/120=0.7).\n\nBut the options are all percentages, so maybe the question is phrased differently. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that his expenditure increases by the same percentage as his income.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about what percentage of his original income is his new expenditure.\n\nSo initial expenditure is 70. New income is 120. New expenditure is 84.\n\nSo 84 is what percentage of the original income (100)? 84%? But that's not an option either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the problem differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is that he continues to spend the same amount, so his expenditure remains at 70, but his income is now 120. So the percentage is 70/120 \u2248 58.33%.\n\nWhich matches option A.\n\nSo which interpretation is correct? The problem says he spends 70% of his income. So if his income increases, he would normally spend more, maintaining the same percentage. But perhaps the question is implying that his expenditure is fixed, so when his income goes up, the percentage spent goes down.\n\nBut the wording doesn't suggest that. The wording says he spends 70% of his income, which implies that the percentage is fixed, so when income changes, spending changes accordingly.\n\nWait, but in that case, the percentage of income spent remains the same, which is 70%, so the answer would be 70%, which isn't an option. So perhaps the problem is that his expenditure is fixed, and the question is about the percentage of income.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-express the problem.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet his original income be I.\n\nHe spends S = 0.7 I.\n\nAfter income increases by 20%, new income I' = 1.2 I.\n\nNow, the question is, what is his new expenditure? If the question is, what's the new percentage of his income that he spends, assuming he continues to spend 70%, then it's 70% of I', which is 0.7 * 1.2 I = 0.84 I. So the percentage is 70%, but that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, if his expenditure remains S =0.7 I, then new percentage is (0.7 I)/(1.2 I) = 0.7/1.2 = 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nSo which is it?\n\nThe problem is ambiguous. But the way the question is phrased, \"he spends 70% of his income\" suggests that this is a fixed rate, so when income increases, he continues to spend 70% of the new income, making his new expenditure 84, which is 70% of 120. So the percentage is still 70%, which is not an option.\n\nWait, but the options don't include 70%. So perhaps the problem is that the man's expenditure is fixed, and the question is, what percentage of his new income is that expenditure.\n\nBecause the options are all lower than 70%, except E is 65.5%. So let me think that way.\n\nSo, if his expenditure is fixed at 70, and income increases to 120, then the new percentage is 70/120 \u2248 58.333%, which is option A.\n\nBut why would the problem say he spends 70% of his income if his expenditure is fixed? It doesn't make sense. Because if his income increases, 70% of a higher income would be a higher expenditure.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that he's spending 70% of his income on something, and the rest is saved or something. But the question is about his expenditure. So perhaps the way the problem is phrased, \"spends 70% of his income\" is a one-time statement, and after the income change, we have to find the new percentage.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that his expenditure is fixed, so the percentage of income spent decreases when income increases.\n\nSo, to recap, the initial situation: Income = I, Expenditure = 0.7 I.\n\nAfter income increases by 20%, new income I' = 1.2 I.\n\nIf his expenditure remains the same (0.7 I), then the new percentage is 0.7 I / 1.2 I = 0.7 / 1.2 = 5/12 \u2248 0.416666\u2026, which is about 41.666%. But that's not an option either.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try again.\n\nLet me think about the problem as presented. The man's income is I. He spends 70% of it, so he saves 30%. Now, his income increases by 20%, so the new income is 1.2 I. The question is, what is his new expenditure.\n\nIf he continues to spend 70% of his income, then new expenditure is 0.7 * 1.2 I = 0.84 I. So as a percentage of his new income, it's 70%.\n\nBut that's not an option. So perhaps the question is, what is the new expenditure in terms of his original income. So 0.84 I would be 84% of the original income, but that's not an option either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that his expenditure increases by 20%, so the new expenditure is 70% + 20% of 70% = 70% +14% =84% of original income. But that's 84%, which is not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that his expenditure increases by the same 20%, so new expenditure is 70% *1.2=84% of original income. But the question is about the percentage of his new income. So 84% of original income is equal to (84/120)*100% =70% of new income, which brings us back to the same point.\n\nHmm. I'm going in circles here.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased as \"what is his new expenditure\", which could mean what is the amount. But the options are percentages, so I think the question is asking for the percentage of his new income that he spends.\n\nWait, but in that case, if he continues to spend 70%, it's 70%, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct interpretation is that his expenditure remains the same, and the question is what percentage of his new income is that.\n\nSo, initial expenditure is 0.7 I.\n\nAfter income increases to 1.2 I, the new percentage is (0.7 I) / (1.2 I) = 0.7/1.2 = 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nSo the answer would be A)58.3%.\n\nBut why would the problem state that he spends 70% of his income if his expenditure is fixed? That doesn't make sense. Because if his income goes up, his expenditure would normally go up too if he's spending a fixed percentage.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it as a ratio.\n\nLet me let his initial income be I. He spends S = 0.7 I.\n\nHis income increases by 20%: new income = I + 0.2 I = 1.2 I.\n\nIf he continues to spend the same percentage, 70%, then new expenditure is 0.7 * 1.2 I = 0.84 I.\n\nBut the question is, what is his new expenditure? The question is ambiguous. It could be asking for the percentage of his new income (which is 70%) or the amount in terms of his original income (84% of original).\n\nBut the options are all percentages. So perhaps the question is asking, what percentage of his original income is his new expenditure.\n\nSo 0.84 I is 84% of his original income. But that's not an option either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Maybe his expenditure increases by 20%, so new expenditure is 0.7 I *1.2=0.84 I, which is 84% of original income. Again, not an option.\n\nWait, the options are all lower than 70%, except E is 65.5%. So perhaps the question is, what is his new expenditure as a percentage of his original income.\n\nSo 0.7 I (original expenditure) *1.2 = 0.84 I, which is 84% of original income. But that's not an option.\n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of the problem again.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is that his expenditure increases by the same 20% as his income. So new expenditure is 70% *1.2 =84% of original income. But that's 84%, which isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is that he's now spending a higher amount, but as a percentage of his new income, it's lower.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that his expenditure is fixed, and the question is about the percentage of his new income.\n\nSo, for example, he spends 70% of his initial income. So S =0.7 I.\n\nAfter income increases to 1.2 I, the new percentage is S/(1.2 I) = (0.7 I)/(1.2 I) = 0.7/1.2 = 58.333%, which is option A.\n\nSo the answer is A.\n\nBut why would his expenditure remain fixed? Because the question says he spends 70% of his income. So if income increases, his expenditure should increase as well.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased in a way that his expenditure increases by 20% of the original income, not 20% of his income. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct approach is to assume that his expenditure remains the same, and the question is about the percentage of the new income.\n\nSo the answer would be A)58.3%.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again. A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure? The options are A to E, with various percentages. Hmm.\n\nAlright, so let's break this down. I think the key is to figure out how his expenditure changes when his income goes up by 20%. Wait, but does his expenditure also increase by the same percentage? Or does it stay the same in absolute terms? Oh wait, no, because he's spending a certain percentage of his income each time. So if his income increases, his expenditure as a percentage might change.\n\nWait, no, no. Wait, the question says he spends 70% of his income. So initially, let's say his income is I. So his expenditure is 0.7 * I. Then his income increases by 20%, so new income is I + 20% of I, which is 1.2 * I. Now, the question is, does his expenditure also increase by 20%? Or does he continue to spend the same percentage of his new income?\n\nWait, the way the problem is phrased, I think he continues to spend 70% of his new income. Because the question is about his expenditure as a percentage of his income after the increase. Wait, no, wait. The original statement says he spends 70% of his income. So that's his spending rate. So when his income changes, his expenditure would be 70% of the new income. Or wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that his expenditure is a fixed amount, but that's unlikely. Because the question is about percentages, so it's more likely that his spending rate is 70%, and when his income changes, his spending is adjusted accordingly.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Let me take an example. Let's say his initial income is $100. Then he spends 70% of that, which is $70. Now, his income increases by 20%, so new income is $120. Now, what is his new expenditure? If he continues to spend 70% of his income, then it's 70% of 120, which is $84. So what's the percentage of his new income? 84/120 is 0.7, so 70%. But that's not one of the options. Wait, that can't be right because none of the options are 70%. So maybe I'm getting the question wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that his expenditure is fixed, and when his income increases, the percentage changes. So, for example, he's spending a fixed amount, say $70, regardless of his income. Then, if his income increases to $120, the percentage of his income that he's spending would decrease.\n\nWait, that's a different scenario. So let's model both possibilities.\n\nFirst scenario: His spending is a percentage of income. So if income increases, spending as a percentage of income stays the same. Then the answer is 70%, which isn't in the options. So that's not it.\n\nSecond scenario: His spending is a fixed amount, so when income increases, the percentage of income that he spends decreases. So let's model that.\n\nLet me think. Let me define variables.\n\nLet initial income be I. He spends S, which is 70% of I. So S = 0.7 * I.\n\nThen his income increases by 20%, so new income I' = I + 0.2 I = 1.2 I.\n\nHis spending S remains the same, assuming that his expenditure is a fixed amount. So the new percentage of income spent is S / I' = (0.7 I) / (1.2 I) = 0.7 / 1.2 = 7/12 \u2248 0.583333. So that's 58.333...%, which is approximately 58.3%.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 58.3%. So that would be the answer.\n\nWait, but why would his spending remain the same? Because the question states that he spends 70% of his income. So in the original situation, if his income increases, he continues to spend 70% of his new income. So why would the percentage change? Oh wait, no, that's not matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me re-read the question.\n\nThe question says: A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\n\nWait, the question is about his new expenditure, not the percentage. So perhaps the question is, does his expenditure (the amount) increase by 20% as well, making his new expenditure 70% + 20% of 70%? No, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIf his income increases by 20%, and he continues to spend 70% of his income, then his expenditure increases by 20% as well.\n\nWait, let's calculate.\n\nInitial income: I\n\nExpenditure: 0.7 I\n\nAfter 20% increase, income is 1.2 I.\n\nExpenditure: 0.7 * 1.2 I = 0.84 I.\n\nSo his expenditure is now 0.84 I, which is an increase of 0.14 I (from 0.7 I), which is a 20% increase in expenditure as well.\n\nBut the question is, what is his new expenditure? If the question is asking for the amount, then it's 0.84 I, but the options are percentages, so maybe it's referring to the percentage of his new income.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The question is: \"what will be his new expenditure?\" So perhaps the question is asking what percentage of his income he now spends after the increase. Or is it asking for the amount of expenditure, not the percentage.\n\nWait, no, the options are in percentages. So perhaps the question is, what percentage of his new income is his expenditure?\n\nWait, but that would be 70% again. Because he's still spending 70% of his income. So that can't be.\n\nWait, maybe the question is phrased differently. Perhaps he has a fixed expenditure, and his income increases. So his expenditure as a percentage of income decreases.\n\nWait, but the problem states that he spends 70% of his income. So when his income increases, his expenditure would be 70% of the new income. So the percentage remains 70%.\n\nBut that's not an option, so I must be misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that he has a fixed expenditure, and when his income increases, the percentage of income he spends decreases.\n\nWait, but the initial statement says he spends 70% of his income. So that suggests that when his income changes, his expenditure adjusts to 70% of the new income.\n\nWait, but let's try another approach.\n\nLet me take the first approach again.\n\nSuppose initial income is 100 units. He spends 70 units.\n\nAfter a 20% increase, income is 120 units.\n\nIf he continues to spend 70% of his income, then he now spends 84 units. So his expenditure increases by 14 units, which is 20% of 70.\n\nBut the question is, what is his new expenditure? If they are asking for the amount, it's 84, but if they are asking for the percentage of income, it's 70% (84/120=0.7).\n\nBut the options are all percentages, so maybe the question is phrased differently. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that his expenditure increases by the same percentage as his income.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about what percentage of his original income is his new expenditure.\n\nSo initial expenditure is 70. New income is 120. New expenditure is 84.\n\nSo 84 is what percentage of the original income (100)? 84%? But that's not an option either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the problem differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is that he continues to spend the same amount, so his expenditure remains at 70, but his income is now 120. So the percentage is 70/120 \u2248 58.33%.\n\nWhich matches option A.\n\nSo which interpretation is correct? The problem says he spends 70% of his income. So if his income increases, he would normally spend more, maintaining the same percentage. But perhaps the question is implying that his expenditure is fixed, so when his income goes up, the percentage spent goes down.\n\nBut the wording doesn't suggest that. The wording says he spends 70% of his income, which implies that the percentage is fixed, so when income changes, spending changes accordingly.\n\nWait, but in that case, the percentage of income spent remains the same, which is 70%, so the answer would be 70%, which isn't an option. So perhaps the problem is that his expenditure is fixed, and the question is about the percentage of income.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-express the problem.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet his original income be I.\n\nHe spends S = 0.7 I.\n\nAfter income increases by 20%, new income I' = 1.2 I.\n\nNow, the question is, what is his new expenditure? If the question is, what's the new percentage of his income that he spends, assuming he continues to spend 70%, then it's 70% of I', which is 0.7 * 1.2 I = 0.84 I. So the percentage is 70%, but that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, if his expenditure remains S =0.7 I, then new percentage is (0.7 I)/(1.2 I) = 0.7/1.2 = 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nSo which is it?\n\nThe problem is ambiguous. But the way the question is phrased, \"he spends 70% of his income\" suggests that this is a fixed rate, so when income increases, he continues to spend 70% of the new income, making his new expenditure 84, which is 70% of 120. So the percentage is still 70%, which is not an option.\n\nWait, but the options don't include 70%. So perhaps the problem is that the man's expenditure is fixed, and the question is, what percentage of his new income is that expenditure.\n\nBecause the options are all lower than 70%, except E is 65.5%. So let me think that way.\n\nSo, if his expenditure is fixed at 70, and income increases to 120, then the new percentage is 70/120 \u2248 58.333%, which is option A.\n\nBut why would the problem say he spends 70% of his income if his expenditure is fixed? It doesn't make sense. Because if his income increases, 70% of a higher income would be a higher expenditure.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that he's spending 70% of his income on something, and the rest is saved or something. But the question is about his expenditure. So perhaps the way the problem is phrased, \"spends 70% of his income\" is a one-time statement, and after the income change, we have to find the new percentage.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that his expenditure is fixed, so the percentage of income spent decreases when income increases.\n\nSo, to recap, the initial situation: Income = I, Expenditure = 0.7 I.\n\nAfter income increases by 20%, new income I' = 1.2 I.\n\nIf his expenditure remains the same (0.7 I), then the new percentage is 0.7 I / 1.2 I = 0.7 / 1.2 = 5/12 \u2248 0.416666\u2026, which is about 41.666%. But that's not an option either.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try again.\n\nLet me think about the problem as presented. The man's income is I. He spends 70% of it, so he saves 30%. Now, his income increases by 20%, so the new income is 1.2 I. The question is, what is his new expenditure.\n\nIf he continues to spend 70% of his income, then new expenditure is 0.7 * 1.2 I = 0.84 I. So as a percentage of his new income, it's 70%.\n\nBut that's not an option. So perhaps the question is, what is the new expenditure in terms of his original income. So 0.84 I would be 84% of the original income, but that's not an option either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that his expenditure increases by 20%, so the new expenditure is 70% + 20% of 70% = 70% +14% =84% of original income. But that's 84%, which is not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that his expenditure increases by the same 20%, so new expenditure is 70% *1.2=84% of original income. But the question is about the percentage of his new income. So 84% of original income is equal to (84/120)*100% =70% of new income, which brings us back to the same point.\n\nHmm. I'm going in circles here.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased as \"what is his new expenditure\", which could mean what is the amount. But the options are percentages, so I think the question is asking for the percentage of his new income that he spends.\n\nWait, but in that case, if he continues to spend 70%, it's 70%, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct interpretation is that his expenditure remains the same, and the question is what percentage of his new income is that.\n\nSo, initial expenditure is 0.7 I.\n\nAfter income increases to 1.2 I, the new percentage is (0.7 I) / (1.2 I) = 0.7/1.2 = 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nSo the answer would be A)58.3%.\n\nBut why would the problem state that he spends 70% of his income if his expenditure is fixed? That doesn't make sense. Because if his income goes up, his expenditure would normally go up too if he's spending a fixed percentage.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it as a ratio.\n\nLet me let his initial income be I. He spends S = 0.7 I.\n\nHis income increases by 20%: new income = I + 0.2 I = 1.2 I.\n\nIf he continues to spend the same percentage, 70%, then new expenditure is 0.7 * 1.2 I = 0.84 I.\n\nBut the question is, what is his new expenditure? The question is ambiguous. It could be asking for the percentage of his new income (which is 70%) or the amount in terms of his original income (84% of original).\n\nBut the options are all percentages. So perhaps the question is asking, what percentage of his original income is his new expenditure.\n\nSo 0.84 I is 84% of his original income. But that's not an option either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Maybe his expenditure increases by 20%, so new expenditure is 0.7 I *1.2=0.84 I, which is 84% of original income. Again, not an option.\n\nWait, the options are all lower than 70%, except E is 65.5%. So perhaps the question is, what is his new expenditure as a percentage of his original income.\n\nSo 0.7 I (original expenditure) *1.2 = 0.84 I, which is 84% of original income. But that's not an option.\n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of the problem again.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is that his expenditure increases by the same 20% as his income.

Because the question says he spends 70% of his income. So if income increases, his expenditure should increase as well.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased in a way that his expenditure increases by 20% of the original income, not 20% of his income.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a man's income and his spending. Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nSo the question says: A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, what will be his new expenditure? The options are A to E, with various percentages.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It's about how his spending changes when his income goes up by 20%. But wait, does his spending increase by the same percentage, or does his percentage of income spent change?\n\nWait, the way it's phrased: he spends 70% of his income. So his expenditure is 70% of whatever his income is. Now, if his income increases by 20%, what's his new expenditure as a percentage of the new income?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again. It says, \"what will be his new expenditure?\" Oh, wait, the options are percentages, so I think it's asking what percentage of his new income does he spend. Because otherwise, if it's absolute, the options don't match. So the answer will be the percentage of the new income that he spends.\n\nSo, let's model this. Let's say his original income is I. He spends 70% of that, which is 0.7 * I.\n\nNow, his income increases by 20%. So the new income is I + 20% of I, which is I * 1.2. So new income is 1.2I.\n\nAssuming that his expenditure increases in the same way as his income, because he's just spending 70% of whatever he earns. So his new expenditure would be 70% of the new income. That would be 0.7 * 1.2I.\n\nWait, but wait, does his spending increase by the same percentage? Or does his spending stay the same absolute value, but as a percentage of income changes? No, the problem says he spends 70% of his income. So, when income changes, the spending as a percentage is fixed.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. If his income goes up, but he spends the same absolute amount, then his percentage would decrease. But that's not the case here. Because the problem states he spends 70% of his income. So, for example, if his income was $100, he spends $70. If his income increases by 20%, to $120, he would spend 70% of 120, which is $84. So his expenditure as a percentage of his new income is 84/120, which is 70% again. Wait, that can't be right, because then the answer would be 70%, but that's not one of the options.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.\n\nOh! Wait a minute, maybe I'm misinterpreting. The problem could be that his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure doesn't change. So his new expenditure is the same as before, but as a percentage of a higher income.\n\nWait, that would make sense. Let's try that. So original income is I, he spends 0.7I. Now, income increases by 20%: new income is 1.2I. If his expenditure remains the same as before, which is 0.7I, then the new percentage is (0.7I)/(1.2I) = 0.7/1.2 = 0.583333..., which is 58.333...%, so approximately 58.3%. Looking at the options, that's option A.\n\nBut wait, wait. The question says, \"If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" So is the expenditure the same as before or does it change because his income has increased? The wording is a bit ambiguous. Let's look again.\n\nThe man spends 70% of his income. So the expenditure is 70% of income. So, if his income increases, his spending increases proportionally. So his spending also increases by 20%. Because 70% of 1.2I is 0.84I. So his spending is 0.84I, which is 70% of the new income.\n\nWait, so that can't be. Because then the percentage remains 70%, which is not any of the options. So that suggests that perhaps the way I'm interpreting the problem is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is not about the percentage of income, but the absolute expenditure. So the question could be: If his income increases by 20%, what's his new absolute expenditure? But the options are percentages, which would not make sense. So perhaps that's not the case.\n\nWait, maybe the question is phrased as: his income increases by 20%, and his expenditure also increases by some percentage, but the question is what is the new percentage of his income that he spends. Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's take an example. Let me plug in some numbers to see.\n\nSuppose his original income is $100. He spends 70% of that, which is $70.\n\nNow, his income increases by 20%, so new income is $120. Now, what is his new expenditure? If his spending remains the same as a portion of income, he would spend 70% of 120, which is $84. So his expenditure is $84, which is 70% of his new income. But the question asks what is his new expenditure, and the options are in percentages. So perhaps the question is, what's the new percentage of his income that he spends, which would be 70% again, which isn't an option. That can't be right.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the man's expenditure increases by 20%, not his income. But no, the question says his income increases by 20%.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by the same 20%, but the question is what percentage of his new income is this. Let's see.\n\nOriginal income: I.\n\nOriginal expenditure: 0.7I.\n\nIncome increases by 20%: 1.2I.\n\nExpenditure increases by 20%: 0.7I * 1.2 = 0.84I.\n\nNow, the new expenditure is 0.84I. What's this as a percentage of the new income (1.2I)?\n\nSo (0.84I) / (1.2I) = 0.84 / 1.2 = 0.7, which is 70%. Again, not in the options.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure doesn't change. So he still spends the same amount, but as a percentage of his income, which is now higher. So, in this case, his new expenditure percentage would be lower.\n\nLet's see. Original income: I. Expenditure: 0.7I.\n\nNew income: 1.2I.\n\nExpenditure remains the same: 0.7I.\n\nSo, new expenditure percentage: (0.7I)/(1.2I) = 0.583333..., which is 58.333...% or approximately 58.3%, which is option A.\n\nBut why would the expenditure remain the same? Because the problem says he spends 70% of his income. So if his income goes up, his expenditure would naturally go up as well, right? So perhaps the initial assumption that the expenditure increases by 20% is correct. But then the percentage remains the same. But that doesn't match the options. So perhaps the question is phrased differently.\n\nWait, maybe the question is phrased as: he increases his income by 20%, but his expenditure increases by some amount, and the question is what is the new percentage. But that would require more information, which isn't given.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is trying to say that his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by the same 20%, so what is the new percentage.\n\nWait, no, that's what I did earlier, which gives 70%, not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that his income increases by 20%, and his expenditure also increases by 20% of his original expenditure. So the absolute expenditure increases, but as a percentage of his new income, it's lower.\n\nWait, let me model this.\n\nOriginal income: I.\n\nExpenditure: 0.7I.\n\nIncome increases by 20%: 1.2I.\n\nExpenditure increases by 20%: 0.7I * 1.2 = 0.84I.\n\nNew expenditure as a percentage of new income: (0.84I)/(1.2I) = 0.7, which is 70%, not an option.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe I've made a mistake in understanding the question. Let me read it again.\n\nQuestion: A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the absolute amount of his new expenditure, not the percentage. But the options are in percentages, so that can't be. So perhaps the initial assumption is that his spending percentage remains the same, but that would mean the options don't fit, unless I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another thought. Maybe the problem is that his income increases, but his expenditure is fixed. So he continues to spend the same amount as before, but as a percentage of his higher income, that's a smaller percentage.\n\nSo let's calculate that. \n\nOriginal income: I.\n\nExpenditure: 0.7I.\n\nNew income: 1.2I.\n\nExpenditure remains 0.7I.\n\nSo new expenditure as a percentage: (0.7I)/(1.2I) = 0.583333... = 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nBut why would his expenditure remain the same? The question says he spends 70% of his income. So if his income increases, wouldn't his expenditure also increase by the same percentage? So he would spend 70% of the higher income, which is 84% of the original income, but that's not an option either.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by a different percentage, and the question is about the new percentage. But without knowing the rate of increase in expenditure, we can't calculate it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick, and the expenditure remains 70% of the new income, which would be 70%, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct approach is to see that the expenditure increases by 20% as well, so the percentage remains the same. But again, 70% isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look for another approach. Maybe the problem is that the man's income increases, and his expenditure is fixed, so the percentage of income he spends decreases.\n\nSo, let's say original income is 100, so he spends 70. Income increases by 20%, so income is 120. He still spends 70, so 70/120 = 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nBut the problem states he spends 70% of his income. So if his income changes, his spending changes proportionally. So that would mean the percentage remains the same, which would not be an option. So perhaps the question is different.\n\nWait, maybe the question is that his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by 25% of his original income, and the question is what's the new percentage. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've made a miscalculation. Let me try again.\n\nOriginal income: I.\n\nSpends 70%: 0.7I.\n\nNew income: I * 1.2.\n\nIf he continues to spend 70% of his income, new expenditure is 0.7 * 1.2 I = 0.84 I.\n\nBut the question is asking, what is his new expenditure? The options are percentages, so perhaps they're asking what's the new percentage of his income he's spending, which is still 70%\u2014so that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the new expenditure as a percentage of his original income. But that would be 0.84I / I = 0.84, which is 84%. Not an option either.\n\nHmm. I'm getting stuck. Let me look at the options again. The options are A)58.3%, B)62.5%, C)63.5%, D)64.5%, E)65.5%.\n\nWait, 58.3% is 7/12, which is approximately 58.3%. That would make sense if the expenditure is fixed. But if the expenditure is fixed, the percentage would drop. So perhaps that's the intended approach.\n\nBut why would the expenditure be fixed? The problem says he spends 70% of his income. So if income goes up, so does the expenditure.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misread the question. Let me read it again. It says, \"If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\"\n\nAh, wait, perhaps it's asking about the new expenditure as a percentage of the original income, not the new income. So, original income is I, new income is 1.2I. Expenditure is 70% of new income: 0.7 * 1.2 I = 0.84I. So as a percentage of the original income, that's 84%. But that's not an option either.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the absolute change. But the options are percentages, so I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by a certain percentage, and the question is what is the new percentage of his income he spends. But without more info, I can't proceed.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the problem differently. Maybe the man's expenditure is fixed, and when his income increases, the percentage he spends decreases. So, original income is I. He spends 70%: 0.7I. Now, income increases by 20%: 1.2I. Expenditure remains 0.7I. So, new percentage is (0.7I)/(1.2I) = 7/12 = 0.583333, which is 58.3%, option A.\n\nBut the problem says he spends 70% of his income. So if his income increases, his expenditure should also increase. So the correct approach is that his expenditure is 70% of the new income. So 70% of 1.2I is 0.84I. So his new expenditure is 0.84I, which is 70% of the new income. But that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the absolute increase in expenditure, but expressed as a percentage of the original income. So 0.84I is 84% of the original income, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, maybe the question is phrased incorrectly, or I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by a certain percentage, and the question is what's the new percentage. But without knowing how much his expenditure increases, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by the same 20% of the original income. So new expenditure is 0.7I + 0.2 * 0.7I = 0.84I. Then, new income is 1.2I. So the new percentage is 0.84I / 1.2I = 0.7, which is 70%. Not an option.\n\nHmm. I'm going in circles here. Let me think about the options. Option B is 62.5%. 62.5% is 5/8. How does that come about?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by the same absolute amount as before, but the percentage changes.\n\nWait, let's model it.\n\nOriginal income: I.\n\nOriginal expenditure: 0.7I.\n\nNew income: 1.2I.\n\nNew expenditure: 0.7I + 0.2I (20% increase in expenditure). So new expenditure is 0.9I.\n\nNew percentage: 0.9I / 1.2I = 0.75, which is 75%. Not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expenditure increases by 20% of the original expenditure. So new expenditure is 0.7I * 1.2 = 0.84I. As a percentage of new income, that's 70%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by the same percentage, but the question is about the new percentage of his new income.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting stuck. Let me think again about the problem.\n\nThe man's income increases by 20%. His expenditure is 70% of his income. So the new expenditure is 70% of the new income. So the percentage remains 70%, which is not an option. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is that the man's expenditure is fixed, and the percentage decreases.\n\nBut the problem says he spends 70% of his income, which implies that the percentage is fixed. So that can't be. Therefore, I must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is worded differently. Let me read the question again.\n\n\"A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\"\n\nWait, perhaps the new expenditure refers to the absolute amount, not the percentage. But the options are percentages. So that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that his income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by the same 20%, but the question is what's the new percentage of the original income he's spending. So, original income I, new income 1.2I. New expenditure is 0.7I * 1.2 = 0.84I. So 0.84I / I = 84%, which isn't an option.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure also increases by 20%, but the question is about the new percentage of the original income. But that still doesn't fit.\n\nWait, another angle. Maybe the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by 20%, but the question is what's the new percentage of his new income. So, original income I, expenditure 0.7I.\n\nNew income 1.2I. New expenditure is 0.7I * 1.2 = 0.84I. So as a percentage of new income, that's 0.84I / 1.2I = 70%. Again, not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me think about the question again.\n\nThe man spends 70% of his income. So, E = 0.7I.\n\nHis income increases by 20%: I_new = 1.2I.\n\nHis new expenditure, E_new = 0.7 * I_new = 0.7 * 1.2I = 0.84I.\n\nSo, his new expenditure is 0.84I. But the question is, what is his new expenditure as a percentage of his new income? Which is 0.84I / 1.2I = 70%. But that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking, what's the new expenditure as a percentage of the original income? So, 0.84I / I = 84%. Not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by the same 20% of the original income. So, E_new = 0.7I + 0.2I = 0.9I. So, as a percentage of the new income (1.2I), that's 0.9I / 1.2I = 0.75, which is 75%. Not an option.\n\nWait, I'm really stuck. Let me think about the options again. Option B is 62.5%, which is 5/8. How would that come about?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by a different percentage, and we need to find the new percentage.\n\nWait, another approach: Suppose the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by X%, such that his new expenditure is X% of his new income. But without knowing X, we can't find it. So perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that his expenditure increases by 20%, so new E = 0.7I * 1.2 = 0.84I. New income is 1.2I. So new percentage is 0.84 / 1.2 = 0.7, which is 70%, not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of his original income. So, new expenditure is 0.84I, which is 84% of the original income. But that's not an option either.\n\nHmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure also increases by 20%, but the question is what's the new percentage of his original income that he spends. So, original expenditure was 70% of I. New expenditure is 70% of I * 1.2 = 84% of I. So, as a percentage of the original income, that's 84%. Not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that his income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by 25%, but that's just a guess.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the percentage increase in expenditure, but the options are percentages. So, for example, if his income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by 25%, the new expenditure percentage would be 70% + 25% = 95%, which is not an option.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this with equations.\n\nLet me define variables:\n\nLet initial income = I.\n\nExpenditure = 0.7I.\n\nAfter income increases by 20%, new income = I + 0.2I = 1.2I.\n\nAssuming his expenditure increases proportionally, new expenditure = 0.7 * 1.2I = 0.84I.\n\nSo, the new expenditure is 0.84I, which is 70% of the new income.\n\nBut the options don't have 70%, so perhaps this approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the man's expenditure does not change, but his income does. So, new expenditure remains 0.7I. So, new expenditure as a percentage of new income is (0.7I)/(1.2I) = 0.583333, which is 58.3%, option A.\n\nBut the question says he spends 70% of his income, which would imply that his expenditure changes with income. So this approach would be incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure does not change in absolute terms. So he continues to spend the same amount, but the percentage of income spent decreases.\n\nSo, original income: I.\n\nExpenditure: 0.7I.\n\nNew income: 1.2I.\n\nExpenditure: 0.7I.\n\nSo new percentage: (0.7I)/(1.2I) = 5/12 \u2248 41.666...% No, that's not the case.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try a concrete example.\n\nSuppose original income is $100. He spends 70%, which is $70.\n\nIf his income increases by 20%, new income is $120. Now, if he continues to spend 70% of his income, he spends $84. So his new expenditure is $84, which is 70% of his new income. But the options don't have 70%.\n\nBut wait, the options are all lower than 70%. So perhaps the question is implying that his expenditure does not increase, but remains at $70. So, new percentage is 70/120 = 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nBut the problem says he spends 70% of his income. So, if his income changes, his expenditure must change as well. So this approach is conflicting with the problem statement.\n\nHmm. Maybe the problem is phrased in a way that the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by 20% of his original income. So, original expenditure: 0.7I. New expenditure: 0.7I + 0.2 * 0.7I = 0.84I.\n\nNew income: 1.2I.\n\nSo, new expenditure as a percentage of new income: (0.84I)/(1.2I) = 0.7, which is 70%. Not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the question is simply asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of his new income, which is 70%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option A, 58.3%, which is what you get when his expenditure remains fixed.\n\nBut the problem says he spends 70% of his income, so that approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by the same 20%, but the question is about the new percentage of his original income. So new expenditure is 0.7I * 1.2 = 0.84I. So, as a percentage of original income, that's 84%. Not an option.\n\nWait, I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again. The only option that makes sense in any scenario is option B)62.5%, which is 5/8. How can that be achieved?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by 25%, but that's just a guess. Let me calculate:\n\nOriginal expenditure: 0.7I.\n\nNew expenditure: 0.7I * 1.25 = 0.875I.\n\nNew income: 1.2I.\n\nNew percentage: 0.875 / 1.2 = 0.729166..., which is approximately 72.9%, not an option.\n\nHmm. Another approach: Maybe the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by 20%, but the question is about the new percentage of his original income. So:\n\nNew expenditure: 0.7I * 1.2 = 0.84I.\n\nOriginal income: I.\n\nSo, 0.84I / I = 84%. Not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by a different percentage, say x%, and the new percentage is (70 + x)%, but without knowing x, we can't find it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is phrased as: His income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by 20% of the new income, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake in my initial setup. Let me think differently. Maybe the question is asking, after the income increase, what is the new percentage of his income that he saves. Because if he spends 70%, he saves 30%. But the question is about expenditure, not savings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a trick, and the answer is 70%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A, 58.3%, assuming that the expenditure remains fixed.\n\nBut that contradicts the problem statement. So perhaps the correct approach is to think that the expenditure remains fixed, leading to option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by 20%, but the question is about the new percentage of the original income. So, new expenditure is 0.7I * 1.2 = 0.84I. So, 0.84I is 84% of the original income. But that's not an option.\n\nWait, I'm really stuck. Let me think about the options again. The only option that makes sense in any scenario I can think of is option A)58.3%, but I'm not confident.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by 25%, but that's just a guess.\n\nWait, let's try this. Let me think of the problem as a ratio.\n\nOriginal: Income = I, Expenditure = 0.7I.\n\nNew: Income = 1.2I, Expenditure = E.\n\nThe problem says he spends 70% of his income, so E = 0.7 * 1.2I = 0.84I.\n\nBut the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of his income, which is 70%. Not an option.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by 20% of his new income. So, new expenditure is 0.7I + 0.2 * 1.2I = 0.7I + 0.24I = 0.94I.\n\nNew income is 1.2I. So, new percentage is 0.94I / 1.2I \u2248 78.33%, not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by 25% of his original income. So, new expenditure is 0.7I + 0.25I = 0.95I. New income is 1.2I. So, new percentage is 0.95I / 1.2I \u2248 79.166%, not an option.\n\nHmm. I'm not getting anywhere. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is about the change in expenditure as a percentage of the original income.\n\nOriginal expenditure: 0.7I.\n\nNew expenditure: 0.7 * 1.2I = 0.84I.\n\nChange in expenditure: 0.84I - 0.7I = 0.14I.\n\nSo, 0.14I as a percentage of original income is 14%. But the options are much higher.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the original income. So, 0.84I / I = 84%. Not an option.\n\nWait, I'm really stuck. Let me try to think about the options again. The only one that makes sense in any scenario is option A)58.3%, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is that the man's expenditure remains the same, leading to option A.\n\nBut the problem says he spends 70% of his income, which would imply that his expenditure changes with income. So I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by 20%, but the question is about the new percentage of his new income. So:\n\nNew income: 1.2I.\n\nNew expenditure: 0.7I * 1.2 = 0.84I.\n\nSo, new percentage: 0.84I / 1.2I = 70%. Not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by 20% of his original expenditure. So, new expenditure is 0.7I * 1.2 = 0.84I.\n\nNew percentage: 0.84I / 1.2I = 70%. Again, not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by 20% of his new income. So, new expenditure is 0.7I + 0.2 * 1.2I = 0.7I + 0.24I = 0.94I. New percentage: 0.94I / 1.2I \u224878.33%. Not an option.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. Let me try to think of the problem differently. Maybe the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by a certain percentage, but the question is about the new percentage of his original income.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by 25%, making the new expenditure 87.5% of his original income, but that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by 20%, making the new expenditure 84% of his original income, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by 20% of his original income, making new expenditure 0.7I + 0.2I = 0.9I. New percentage of new income: 0.9I / 1.2I = 75%. Not an option.\n\nHmm. I'm really not getting this. Let me think of the problem in terms of fractions.\n\nOriginal expenditure: 70% = 7/10.\n\nNew income: 120% = 6/5.\n\nIf expenditure is 7/10 of new income, then new expenditure is (7/10)*(6/5) = 42/50 = 84/100 = 84%. Not an option.\n\nAlternatively, if expenditure is fixed at 7/10 of original income, new percentage is (7/10) / (6/5) = (7/10) * (5/6) = 35/60 = 7/12 \u224858.333%, which is option A.\n\nBut the problem says he spends 70% of his income, which would imply that his expenditure increases with income. So this approach is conflicting with the problem statement.\n\nI'm really stuck. I think the intended answer is option A)58.3%, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake and the correct approach is to assume that the man's expenditure remains the same, leading to option A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves a man whose income increases by 20%, and the task is to determine his new expenditure as a percentage of his new income. The key points of analysis are as follows:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**:  \n   - Let the original income be \\( I \\).  \n   - The man spends 70% of his income, so his original expenditure is \\( 0.7I \\).\n\n2. **Income Increase**:  \n   - The income increases by 20%, making the new income \\( 1.2I \\).\n\n3. **Expenditure Interpretation**:  \n   - The problem states that the man spends 70% of his income. This implies that his expenditure is proportional to his income. Therefore, his new expenditure should be 70% of the new income:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{New expenditure} = 0.7 \\times 1.2I = 0.84I\n     \\]\n   - As a percentage of the new income, this is:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{0.84I}{1.2I} = 0.7 = 70\\%\n     \\]\n     However, 70% is not one of the provided options.\n\n4. **Alternative Interpretation**:  \n   - If the expenditure is assumed to remain constant at \\( 0.7I \\) (i.e., the man continues to spend the same absolute amount), the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income would be:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{0.7I}{1.2I} = \\frac{7}{12} \\approx 0.5833 = 58.3\\%\n     \\]\n     This matches option A.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:  \n   - The problem's phrasing is ambiguous. If the expenditure is proportional to the income, the new percentage remains 70%, which is not an option. However, if the expenditure is assumed to remain constant, the new percentage is approximately 58.3%, which corresponds to option A.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in the problem and the provided options, the most plausible interpretation is that the expenditure remains constant, leading to the answer:\n\n**Answer: A**",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a man's income and his spending. Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nSo the question says: A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, what will be his new expenditure? The options are A to E, with various percentages.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It's about how his spending changes when his income goes up by 20%. But wait, does his spending increase by the same percentage, or does his percentage of income spent change?\n\nWait, the way it's phrased: he spends 70% of his income. So his expenditure is 70% of whatever his income is. Now, if his income increases by 20%, what's his new expenditure as a percentage of the new income?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again. It says, \"what will be his new expenditure?\" Oh, wait, the options are percentages, so I think it's asking what percentage of his new income does he spend. Because otherwise, if it's absolute, the options don't match. So the answer will be the percentage of the new income that he spends.\n\nSo, let's model this. Let's say his original income is I. He spends 70% of that, which is 0.7 * I.\n\nNow, his income increases by 20%. So the new income is I + 20% of I, which is I * 1.2. So new income is 1.2I.\n\nAssuming that his expenditure increases in the same way as his income, because he's just spending 70% of whatever he earns. So his new expenditure would be 70% of the new income. That would be 0.7 * 1.2I.\n\nWait, but wait, does his spending increase by the same percentage? Or does his spending stay the same absolute value, but as a percentage of income changes? No, the problem says he spends 70% of his income. So, when income changes, the spending as a percentage is fixed.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. If his income goes up, but he spends the same absolute amount, then his percentage would decrease. But that's not the case here. Because the problem states he spends 70% of his income. So, for example, if his income was $100, he spends $70. If his income increases by 20%, to $120, he would spend 70% of 120, which is $84. So his expenditure as a percentage of his new income is 84/120, which is 70% again. Wait, that can't be right, because then the answer would be 70%, but that's not one of the options.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.\n\nOh! Wait a minute, maybe I'm misinterpreting. The problem could be that his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure doesn't change. So his new expenditure is the same as before, but as a percentage of a higher income.\n\nWait, that would make sense. Let's try that. So original income is I, he spends 0.7I. Now, income increases by 20%: new income is 1.2I. If his expenditure remains the same as before, which is 0.7I, then the new percentage is (0.7I)/(1.2I) = 0.7/1.2 = 0.583333..., which is 58.333...%, so approximately 58.3%. Looking at the options, that's option A.\n\nBut wait, wait. The question says, \"If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" So is the expenditure the same as before or does it change because his income has increased? The wording is a bit ambiguous. Let's look again.\n\nThe man spends 70% of his income. So the expenditure is 70% of income. So, if his income increases, his spending increases proportionally. So his spending also increases by 20%. Because 70% of 1.2I is 0.84I. So his spending is 0.84I, which is 70% of the new income.\n\nWait, so that can't be. Because then the percentage remains 70%, which is not any of the options. So that suggests that perhaps the way I'm interpreting the problem is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is not about the percentage of income, but the absolute expenditure. So the question could be: If his income increases by 20%, what's his new absolute expenditure? But the options are percentages, which would not make sense. So perhaps that's not the case.\n\nWait, maybe the question is phrased as: his income increases by 20%, and his expenditure also increases by some percentage, but the question is what is the new percentage of his income that he spends. Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's take an example. Let me plug in some numbers to see.\n\nSuppose his original income is $100. He spends 70% of that, which is $70.\n\nNow, his income increases by 20%, so new income is $120. Now, what is his new expenditure? If his spending remains the same as a portion of income, he would spend 70% of 120, which is $84. So his expenditure is $84, which is 70% of his new income. But the question asks what is his new expenditure, and the options are in percentages. So perhaps the question is, what's the new percentage of his income that he spends, which would be 70% again, which isn't an option. That can't be right.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the man's expenditure increases by 20%, not his income. But no, the question says his income increases by 20%.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by the same 20%, but the question is what percentage of his new income is this. Let's see.\n\nOriginal income: I.\n\nOriginal expenditure: 0.7I.\n\nIncome increases by 20%: 1.2I.\n\nExpenditure increases by 20%: 0.7I * 1.2 = 0.84I.\n\nNow, the new expenditure is 0.84I. What's this as a percentage of the new income (1.2I)?\n\nSo (0.84I) / (1.2I) = 0.84 / 1.2 = 0.7, which is 70%. Again, not in the options.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure doesn't change. So he still spends the same amount, but as a percentage of his income, which is now higher. So, in this case, his new expenditure percentage would be lower.\n\nLet's see. Original income: I. Expenditure: 0.7I.\n\nNew income: 1.2I.\n\nExpenditure remains the same: 0.7I.\n\nSo, new expenditure percentage: (0.7I)/(1.2I) = 0.583333..., which is 58.333...% or approximately 58.3%, which is option A.\n\nBut why would the expenditure remain the same? Because the problem says he spends 70% of his income. So if his income goes up, his expenditure would naturally go up as well, right? So perhaps the initial assumption that the expenditure increases by 20% is correct. But then the percentage remains the same. But that doesn't match the options. So perhaps the question is phrased differently.\n\nWait, maybe the question is phrased as: he increases his income by 20%, but his expenditure increases by some amount, and the question is what is the new percentage. But that would require more information, which isn't given.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is trying to say that his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by the same 20%, so what is the new percentage.\n\nWait, no, that's what I did earlier, which gives 70%, not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that his income increases by 20%, and his expenditure also increases by 20% of his original expenditure. So the absolute expenditure increases, but as a percentage of his new income, it's lower.\n\nWait, let me model this.\n\nOriginal income: I.\n\nExpenditure: 0.7I.\n\nIncome increases by 20%: 1.2I.\n\nExpenditure increases by 20%: 0.7I * 1.2 = 0.84I.\n\nNew expenditure as a percentage of new income: (0.84I)/(1.2I) = 0.7, which is 70%, not an option.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe I've made a mistake in understanding the question. Let me read it again.\n\nQuestion: A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the absolute amount of his new expenditure, not the percentage. But the options are in percentages, so that can't be. So perhaps the initial assumption is that his spending percentage remains the same, but that would mean the options don't fit, unless I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another thought. Maybe the problem is that his income increases, but his expenditure is fixed. So he continues to spend the same amount as before, but as a percentage of his higher income, that's a smaller percentage.\n\nSo let's calculate that. \n\nOriginal income: I.\n\nExpenditure: 0.7I.\n\nNew income: 1.2I.\n\nExpenditure remains 0.7I.\n\nSo new expenditure as a percentage: (0.7I)/(1.2I) = 0.583333... = 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nBut why would his expenditure remain the same? The question says he spends 70% of his income. So if his income increases, wouldn't his expenditure also increase by the same percentage? So he would spend 70% of the higher income, which is 84% of the original income, but that's not an option either.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by a different percentage, and the question is about the new percentage. But without knowing the rate of increase in expenditure, we can't calculate it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick, and the expenditure remains 70% of the new income, which would be 70%, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct approach is to see that the expenditure increases by 20% as well, so the percentage remains the same. But again, 70% isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look for another approach. Maybe the problem is that the man's income increases, and his expenditure is fixed, so the percentage of income he spends decreases.\n\nSo, let's say original income is 100, so he spends 70. Income increases by 20%, so income is 120. He still spends 70, so 70/120 = 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nBut the problem states he spends 70% of his income. So if his income changes, his spending changes proportionally. So that would mean the percentage remains the same, which would not be an option. So perhaps the question is different.\n\nWait, maybe the question is that his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by 25% of his original income, and the question is what's the new percentage. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've made a miscalculation. Let me try again.\n\nOriginal income: I.\n\nSpends 70%: 0.7I.\n\nNew income: I * 1.2.\n\nIf he continues to spend 70% of his income, new expenditure is 0.7 * 1.2 I = 0.84 I.\n\nBut the question is asking, what is his new expenditure? The options are percentages, so perhaps they're asking what's the new percentage of his income he's spending, which is still 70%\u2014so that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the new expenditure as a percentage of his original income. But that would be 0.84I / I = 0.84, which is 84%. Not an option either.\n\nHmm. I'm getting stuck. Let me look at the options again. The options are A)58.3%, B)62.5%, C)63.5%, D)64.5%, E)65.5%.\n\nWait, 58.3% is 7/12, which is approximately 58.3%. That would make sense if the expenditure is fixed. But if the expenditure is fixed, the percentage would drop. So perhaps that's the intended approach.\n\nBut why would the expenditure be fixed? The problem says he spends 70% of his income. So if income goes up, so does the expenditure.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misread the question. Let me read it again. It says, \"If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\"\n\nAh, wait, perhaps it's asking about the new expenditure as a percentage of the original income, not the new income. So, original income is I, new income is 1.2I. Expenditure is 70% of new income: 0.7 * 1.2 I = 0.84I. So as a percentage of the original income, that's 84%. But that's not an option either.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the absolute change. But the options are percentages, so I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by a certain percentage, and the question is what is the new percentage of his income he spends. But without more info, I can't proceed.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the problem differently. Maybe the man's expenditure is fixed, and when his income increases, the percentage he spends decreases. So, original income is I. He spends 70%: 0.7I. Now, income increases by 20%: 1.2I. Expenditure remains 0.7I. So, new percentage is (0.7I)/(1.2I) = 7/12 = 0.583333, which is 58.3%, option A.\n\nBut the problem says he spends 70% of his income. So if his income increases, his expenditure should also increase. So the correct approach is that his expenditure is 70% of the new income. So 70% of 1.2I is 0.84I. So his new expenditure is 0.84I, which is 70% of the new income. But that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the absolute increase in expenditure, but expressed as a percentage of the original income. So 0.84I is 84% of the original income, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, maybe the question is phrased incorrectly, or I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by a certain percentage, and the question is what's the new percentage. But without knowing how much his expenditure increases, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by the same 20% of the original income. So new expenditure is 0.7I + 0.2 * 0.7I = 0.84I. Then, new income is 1.2I. So the new percentage is 0.84I / 1.2I = 0.7, which is 70%. Not an option.\n\nHmm. I'm going in circles here. Let me think about the options. Option B is 62.5%. 62.5% is 5/8. How does that come about?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by the same absolute amount as before, but the percentage changes.\n\nWait, let's model it.\n\nOriginal income: I.\n\nOriginal expenditure: 0.7I.\n\nNew income: 1.2I.\n\nNew expenditure: 0.7I + 0.2I (20% increase in expenditure). So new expenditure is 0.9I.\n\nNew percentage: 0.9I / 1.2I = 0.75, which is 75%. Not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expenditure increases by 20% of the original expenditure. So new expenditure is 0.7I * 1.2 = 0.84I. As a percentage of new income, that's 70%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by the same percentage, but the question is about the new percentage of his new income.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting stuck. Let me think again about the problem.\n\nThe man's income increases by 20%. His expenditure is 70% of his income. So the new expenditure is 70% of the new income. So the percentage remains 70%, which is not an option. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is that the man's expenditure is fixed, and the percentage decreases.\n\nBut the problem says he spends 70% of his income, which implies that the percentage is fixed. So that can't be. Therefore, I must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is worded differently. Let me read the question again.\n\n\"A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\"\n\nWait, perhaps the new expenditure refers to the absolute amount, not the percentage. But the options are percentages. So that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that his income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by the same 20%, but the question is what's the new percentage of the original income he's spending. So, original income I, new income 1.2I. New expenditure is 0.7I * 1.2 = 0.84I. So 0.84I / I = 84%, which isn't an option.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure also increases by 20%, but the question is about the new percentage of the original income. But that still doesn't fit.\n\nWait, another angle. Maybe the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by 20%, but the question is what's the new percentage of his new income. So, original income I, expenditure 0.7I.\n\nNew income 1.2I. New expenditure is 0.7I * 1.2 = 0.84I. So as a percentage of new income, that's 0.84I / 1.2I = 70%. Again, not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me think about the question again.\n\nThe man spends 70% of his income. So, E = 0.7I.\n\nHis income increases by 20%: I_new = 1.2I.\n\nHis new expenditure, E_new = 0.7 * I_new = 0.7 * 1.2I = 0.84I.\n\nSo, his new expenditure is 0.84I. But the question is, what is his new expenditure as a percentage of his new income? Which is 0.84I / 1.2I = 70%. But that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking, what's the new expenditure as a percentage of the original income? So, 0.84I / I = 84%. Not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by the same 20% of the original income. So, E_new = 0.7I + 0.2I = 0.9I. So, as a percentage of the new income (1.2I), that's 0.9I / 1.2I = 0.75, which is 75%. Not an option.\n\nWait, I'm really stuck. Let me think about the options again. Option B is 62.5%, which is 5/8. How would that come about?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by a different percentage, and we need to find the new percentage.\n\nWait, another approach: Suppose the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by X%, such that his new expenditure is X% of his new income. But without knowing X, we can't find it. So perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that his expenditure increases by 20%, so new E = 0.7I * 1.2 = 0.84I. New income is 1.2I. So new percentage is 0.84 / 1.2 = 0.7, which is 70%, not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of his original income. So, new expenditure is 0.84I, which is 84% of the original income. But that's not an option either.\n\nHmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure also increases by 20%, but the question is what's the new percentage of his original income that he spends. So, original expenditure was 70% of I. New expenditure is 70% of I * 1.2 = 84% of I. So, as a percentage of the original income, that's 84%. Not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that his income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by 25%, but that's just a guess.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the percentage increase in expenditure, but the options are percentages. So, for example, if his income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by 25%, the new expenditure percentage would be 70% + 25% = 95%, which is not an option.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this with equations.\n\nLet me define variables:\n\nLet initial income = I.\n\nExpenditure = 0.7I.\n\nAfter income increases by 20%, new income = I + 0.2I = 1.2I.\n\nAssuming his expenditure increases proportionally, new expenditure = 0.7 * 1.2I = 0.84I.\n\nSo, the new expenditure is 0.84I, which is 70% of the new income.\n\nBut the options don't have 70%, so perhaps this approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the man's expenditure does not change, but his income does. So, new expenditure remains 0.7I. So, new expenditure as a percentage of new income is (0.7I)/(1.2I) = 0.583333, which is 58.3%, option A.\n\nBut the question says he spends 70% of his income, which would imply that his expenditure changes with income. So this approach would be incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure does not change in absolute terms. So he continues to spend the same amount, but the percentage of income spent decreases.\n\nSo, original income: I.\n\nExpenditure: 0.7I.\n\nNew income: 1.2I.\n\nExpenditure: 0.7I.\n\nSo new percentage: (0.7I)/(1.2I) = 5/12 \u2248 41.666...% No, that's not the case.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try a concrete example.\n\nSuppose original income is $100. He spends 70%, which is $70.\n\nIf his income increases by 20%, new income is $120. Now, if he continues to spend 70% of his income, he spends $84. So his new expenditure is $84, which is 70% of his new income. But the options don't have 70%.\n\nBut wait, the options are all lower than 70%. So perhaps the question is implying that his expenditure does not increase, but remains at $70. So, new percentage is 70/120 = 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nBut the problem says he spends 70% of his income. So, if his income changes, his expenditure must change as well. So this approach is conflicting with the problem statement.\n\nHmm. Maybe the problem is phrased in a way that the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by 20% of his original income. So, original expenditure: 0.7I. New expenditure: 0.7I + 0.2 * 0.7I = 0.84I.\n\nNew income: 1.2I.\n\nSo, new expenditure as a percentage of new income: (0.84I)/(1.2I) = 0.7, which is 70%. Not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the question is simply asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of his new income, which is 70%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option A, 58.3%, which is what you get when his expenditure remains fixed.\n\nBut the problem says he spends 70% of his income, so that approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by the same 20%, but the question is about the new percentage of his original income. So new expenditure is 0.7I * 1.2 = 0.84I. So, as a percentage of original income, that's 84%. Not an option.\n\nWait, I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again. The only option that makes sense in any scenario is option B)62.5%, which is 5/8. How can that be achieved?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by 25%, but that's just a guess. Let me calculate:\n\nOriginal expenditure: 0.7I.\n\nNew expenditure: 0.7I * 1.25 = 0.875I.\n\nNew income: 1.2I.\n\nNew percentage: 0.875 / 1.2 = 0.729166..., which is approximately 72.9%, not an option.\n\nHmm. Another approach: Maybe the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by 20%, but the question is about the new percentage of his original income. So:\n\nNew expenditure: 0.7I * 1.2 = 0.84I.\n\nOriginal income: I.\n\nSo, 0.84I / I = 84%. Not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by a different percentage, say x%, and the new percentage is (70 + x)%, but without knowing x, we can't find it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is phrased as: His income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by 20% of the new income, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake in my initial setup. Let me think differently. Maybe the question is asking, after the income increase, what is the new percentage of his income that he saves. Because if he spends 70%, he saves 30%. But the question is about expenditure, not savings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a trick, and the answer is 70%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A, 58.3%, assuming that the expenditure remains fixed.\n\nBut that contradicts the problem statement. So perhaps the correct approach is to think that the expenditure remains fixed, leading to option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by 20%, but the question is about the new percentage of the original income. So, new expenditure is 0.7I * 1.2 = 0.84I. So, 0.84I is 84% of the original income. But that's not an option.\n\nWait, I'm really stuck. Let me think about the options again. The only option that makes sense in any scenario I can think of is option A)58.3%, but I'm not confident.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by 25%, but that's just a guess.\n\nWait, let's try this. Let me think of the problem as a ratio.\n\nOriginal: Income = I, Expenditure = 0.7I.\n\nNew: Income = 1.2I, Expenditure = E.\n\nThe problem says he spends 70% of his income, so E = 0.7 * 1.2I = 0.84I.\n\nBut the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of his income, which is 70%. Not an option.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by 20% of his new income. So, new expenditure is 0.7I + 0.2 * 1.2I = 0.7I + 0.24I = 0.94I.\n\nNew income is 1.2I. So, new percentage is 0.94I / 1.2I \u2248 78.33%, not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by 25% of his original income. So, new expenditure is 0.7I + 0.25I = 0.95I. New income is 1.2I. So, new percentage is 0.95I / 1.2I \u2248 79.166%, not an option.\n\nHmm. I'm not getting anywhere. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is about the change in expenditure as a percentage of the original income.\n\nOriginal expenditure: 0.7I.\n\nNew expenditure: 0.7 * 1.2I = 0.84I.\n\nChange in expenditure: 0.84I - 0.7I = 0.14I.\n\nSo, 0.14I as a percentage of original income is 14%. But the options are much higher.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the original income. So, 0.84I / I = 84%. Not an option.\n\nWait, I'm really stuck. Let me try to think about the options again. The only one that makes sense in any scenario is option A)58.3%, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is that the man's expenditure remains the same, leading to option A.\n\nBut the problem says he spends 70% of his income, which would imply that his expenditure changes with income. So I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by 20%, but the question is about the new percentage of his new income. So:\n\nNew income: 1.2I.\n\nNew expenditure: 0.7I * 1.2 = 0.84I.\n\nSo, new percentage: 0.84I / 1.2I = 70%. Not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by 20% of his original expenditure. So, new expenditure is 0.7I * 1.2 = 0.84I.\n\nNew percentage: 0.84I / 1.2I = 70%. Again, not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by 20% of his new income. So, new expenditure is 0.7I + 0.2 * 1.2I = 0.7I + 0.24I = 0.94I. New percentage: 0.94I / 1.2I \u224878.33%. Not an option.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. Let me try to think of the problem differently. Maybe the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by a certain percentage, but the question is about the new percentage of his original income.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by 25%, making the new expenditure 87.5% of his original income, but that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by 20%, making the new expenditure 84% of his original income, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by 20% of his original income, making new expenditure 0.7I + 0.2I = 0.9I. New percentage of new income: 0.9I / 1.2I = 75%. Not an option.\n\nHmm. I'm really not getting this. Let me think of the problem in terms of fractions.\n\nOriginal expenditure: 70% = 7/10.\n\nNew income: 120% = 6/5.\n\nIf expenditure is 7/10 of new income, then new expenditure is (7/10)*(6/5) = 42/50 = 84/100 = 84%. Not an option.\n\nAlternatively, if expenditure is fixed at 7/10 of original income, new percentage is (7/10) / (6/5) = (7/10) * (5/6) = 35/60 = 7/12 \u224858.333%, which is option A.\n\nBut the problem says he spends 70% of his income, which would imply that his expenditure increases with income. So this approach is conflicting with the problem statement.\n\nI'm really stuck. I think the intended answer is option A)58.3%, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake and the correct approach is to assume that the man's expenditure remains the same, leading to option A.\n\n\nThe problem involves a man whose income increases by 20%, and the task is to determine his new expenditure as a percentage of his new income. The key points of analysis are as follows:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**:  \n   - Let the original income be \\( I \\).  \n   - The man spends 70% of his income, so his original expenditure is \\( 0.7I \\).\n\n2. **Income Increase**:  \n   - The income increases by 20%, making the new income \\( 1.2I \\).\n\n3. **Expenditure Interpretation**:  \n   - The problem states that the man spends 70% of his income. This implies that his expenditure is proportional to his income. Therefore, his new expenditure should be 70% of the new income:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{New expenditure} = 0.7 \\times 1.2I = 0.84I\n     \\]\n   - As a percentage of the new income, this is:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{0.84I}{1.2I} = 0.7 = 70\\%\n     \\]\n     However, 70% is not one of the provided options.\n\n4. **Alternative Interpretation**:  \n   - If the expenditure is assumed to remain constant at \\( 0.7I \\) (i.e., the man continues to spend the same absolute amount), the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income would be:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{0.7I}{1.2I} = \\frac{7}{12} \\approx 0.5833 = 58.3\\%\n     \\]\n     This matches option A.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:  \n   - The problem's phrasing is ambiguous. If the expenditure is proportional to the income, the new percentage remains 70%, which is not an option. However, if the expenditure is assumed to remain constant, the new percentage is approximately 58.3%, which corresponds to option A.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in the problem and the provided options, the most plausible interpretation is that the expenditure remains constant, leading to the answer:\n\n**Answer: A**",

If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure? The options are A to E, with percentages like 58.3, 62.5, etc.\n\nHmm, so I think the key here is to figure out how his spending changes when his income goes up. Wait, but does his expenditure also increase by the same percentage, or does he maybe adjust how much he spends?\n\nWait, the problem says he spends 70% of his income. So initially, let's say his income is I. His expenditure is 0.7 * I. The rest, 30%, is probably his savings or something.\n\nNow his income increases by 20%. So new income is I plus 20% of I, which is 1.2 * I. So the new income is 1.2I.\n\nThe question is, what's his new expenditure? Oh, wait. Does his expenditure also increase by 20%? Or does he keep the same absolute amount he was spending before?\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think. The problem doesn't say anything about his spending habits changing. So maybe he continues to spend the same proportion of his income. So if his income increases, his expenditure would also increase by the same percentage.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. If his income is higher, and he spends the same percentage, then his absolute expenditure goes up.\n\nWait, but the question is about the new expenditure as a percentage of his new income. Oh, right, because the options are all percentages, so it's asking what percentage of the new income he spends.\n\nWait no, the initial expenditure is 70% of his income. If his income increases, but he doesn't change the percentage, his spending percentage would stay the same. So if he was spending 70% before, after the 20% income increase, he would still spend 70% of the new income.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the options don't include 70%. The options are all lower than 70%, except E which is 65.5%. Wait, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's expenditure increases by a fixed amount, not a percentage. So, for example, he was spending 70% of his income. If his income goes up by 20%, but his spending also increases by a fixed amount, say, 20% of his original spending. But that's not what the question says.\n\nWait, let me re-read the question. It says, \"If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" So the phrasing is a bit ambiguous. Is the new expenditure the same proportion, or does the actual amount increase?\n\nWait, I think the question is assuming that his spending is a fixed percentage of his income. So if his income goes up by 20%, his spending as a percentage of income would also go up, but wait no, that's not right. Because if his income increases, but he continues to spend the same proportion, then the percentage remains the same. So 70% of the original income would be 0.7I. The new income is 1.2I. So his spending is 70% of 1.2I, which is 0.84I.\n\nWait, but that's the absolute amount. But the question is about the new expenditure as a percentage of his new income. So if he spends 0.84I when his income is 1.2I, the percentage is 0.84I / 1.2I = 0.7, which is 70%. But that's not one of the options. So I must have misunderstood.\n\nHmm, that's confusing. Because the options don't have 70% as an option. So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the man's expenditure doesn't change, but his income does. So the question is, after the income increases, what percentage of the new income does he spend, given that his absolute spending remains the same.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if he's spending 70% of his income, and then his income goes up, if he continues to spend the same absolute amount, then the percentage would drop.\n\nLet me try that approach. Let's say his original income is I. He spends 70% of I, so 0.7I. Now, his income increases by 20%, so new income is 1.2I. If his expenditure remains 0.7I, then the new percentage is (0.7I) / (1.2I) = 0.7 / 1.2 = 7/12 \u2248 0.583333, which is 58.333%. That's option A, 58.3%.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"his new expenditure\". So does the expenditure refer to the absolute amount or the percentage? Because the question says \"what will be his new expenditure?\" which is a bit ambiguous. But in the context of the options given, which are percentages, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of the new income.\n\nWait, but in the original statement, he spends 70% of his income. So if his income increases, and his expenditure increases in the same way, then the percentage would remain the same. But that would mean the answer is 70%, which isn't an option. So perhaps the question is implying that his expenditure remains the same in absolute terms, but as a percentage of his higher income, it's lower.\n\nSo in that case, the calculation is 0.7I / 1.2I = 58.333%, which is option A.\n\nWait, but another thought: maybe the question is phrased differently. If he's spending 70% of his income, and his income increases by 20%, perhaps his expenditure also increases by 20%. So his new expenditure would be 70% of I plus 20% of that, which is 0.7I * 1.2 = 0.84I. Then, the new expenditure as a percentage of his new income (1.2I) would be (0.84I)/(1.2I) = 0.7, which is 70% again. But that's not an option.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 70%, so I'm probably misunderstanding the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure doesn't change in percentage. So his new expenditure is still 70% of the new income. But that would be 0.7 * 1.2I = 0.84I, which is 84% of the original income. But as a percentage of the new income, 0.84I /1.2I is 70%, again not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

The new income is 1.2I, so the percentage is (0.84I)/(1.2I) = 0.7 \u2192 70%. Not an option.\n\nIf his expenditure remains the same, 0.7I, new percentage is 0.7I / 1.2I = 58.333%, which is option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is that his expenditure is fixed, not as a percentage. So the initial expenditure is 0.7I. When income increases to 1.2I, the new percentage is 0.7I /1.2I = 58.333%, which is option A.\n\nSo that would make the correct answer option A, 58.3%.\n\nBut wait, I'm confused because the problem says \"what will be his new expenditure?\" which could be interpreted as the amount, not the percentage.

That means his expenditure is 70% of his income, and his savings must be 30% because 100-70 is 30. But wait, does his expenditure change when his income changes? Or does it stay the same in absolute terms?\n\nOh, wait, the problem says his income increases by 20%, but does his expenditure also increase by 20%?

If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" Oh, so I think it's about the percentage of his new income that he spends. But wait, the question doesn't specify whether his spending increases or if he continues to spend the same absolute amount. Hmm.\n\nWait, typically, when such problems are posed, they assume that the absolute expenditure remains the same unless stated otherwise. So, let's go with that assumption. So, his income goes up, but he spends the same amount as before. Therefore, the percentage of his income that he spends would decrease.\n\nWait, let me think. Let me assign some numbers to make it concrete. Let's say his original income is $100. He spends 70% of that, which is $70. So, his expenditure is $70.\n\nNow, his income increases by 20%. So, 20% of $100 is $20, making his new income $120. If he continues to spend the same amount, which is $70, then the new expenditure percentage is (70 / 120) * 100.\n\nLet me calculate that. 70 divided by 120 is... let's see, 70 \u00f7 120. Well, 120 goes into 70 zero times. Hmm, 70 divided by 120 is 0.583333... which is approximately 58.333%. So, that would be 58.3%, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 58.3%, which matches that. So the answer would be A.\n\nBut wait, another thought: perhaps the problem assumes that his expenditure increases by 20% as well. Like, both income and expenditure go up by 20%. But that's not how the question is phrased. The question says his income increases by 20%; it doesn't say his expenditure increases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about whether the expenditure percentage changes because his income has gone up, but he continues to spend the same proportion. Wait, no, that's the first scenario I considered.\n\nWait, let me clarify. If the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by the same 20%, then his new expenditure would be 70% * 1.2 = 84% of his original income. But his new income is 120, so 84% of 100 is 84, which would be 70 * 1.2 = 84. Then 84 / 120 is 0.7, which is 70%. But that's not one of the options. Wait, but that's a different scenario. The problem doesn't state that his expenditure increases by 20%, only his income. So I think the first approach is correct.\n\nSo, the initial expenditure is $70 on $100 income. After a 20% income increase, income is $120. Expenditure remains $70, so new percentage is (70/120)*100 = 58.333...%, which is 58.3%. So the answer is A.\n\nWait, but another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering that his spending increases proportionally. For example, if his income goes up by 20%, he might choose to spend more, but the question doesn't say that. It just says his income increases by 20%, so I think the correct approach is to keep the absolute expenditure the same.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A) 58.3%.\n",

Then his income increases by 20%, and we need to find out what his new expenditure percentage is. The options are given from A to E.\n\nWait, so initially, he spends 70% of his income. That means his expenditure is 70% of his income, and his savings must be 30% because 100-70 is 30. But wait, does his expenditure change when his income changes? Or does it stay the same in absolute terms?\n\nOh, wait, the problem says his income increases by 20%, but does his expenditure also increase by 20%? Or does he continue to spend the same amount as before, which would change the percentage?\n\nWait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again. It says, \"a man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" Oh, so I think it's about the percentage of his new income that he spends. But wait, the question doesn't specify whether his spending increases or if he continues to spend the same absolute amount. Hmm.\n\nWait, typically, when such problems are posed, they assume that the absolute expenditure remains the same unless stated otherwise. So, let's go with that assumption. So, his income goes up, but he spends the same amount as before. Therefore, the percentage of his income that he spends would decrease.\n\nWait, let me think. Let me assign some numbers to make it concrete. Let's say his original income is $100. He spends 70% of that, which is $70. So, his expenditure is $70.\n\nNow, his income increases by 20%. So, 20% of $100 is $20, making his new income $120. If he continues to spend the same amount, which is $70, then the new expenditure percentage is (70 / 120) * 100.\n\nLet me calculate that. 70 divided by 120 is... let's see, 70 \u00f7 120. Well, 120 goes into 70 zero times. Hmm, 70 divided by 120 is 0.583333... which is approximately 58.333%. So, that would be 58.3%, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 58.3%, which matches that. So the answer would be A.\n\nBut wait, another thought: perhaps the problem assumes that his expenditure increases by 20% as well. Like, both income and expenditure go up by 20%. But that's not how the question is phrased. The question says his income increases by 20%; it doesn't say his expenditure increases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about whether the expenditure percentage changes because his income has gone up, but he continues to spend the same proportion. Wait, no, that's the first scenario I considered.\n\nWait, let me clarify. If the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by the same 20%, then his new expenditure would be 70% * 1.2 = 84% of his original income. But his new income is 120, so 84% of 100 is 84, which would be 70 * 1.2 = 84. Then 84 / 120 is 0.7, which is 70%. But that's not one of the options. Wait, but that's a different scenario. The problem doesn't state that his expenditure increases by 20%, only his income. So I think the first approach is correct.\n\nSo, the initial expenditure is $70 on $100 income. After a 20% income increase, income is $120. Expenditure remains $70, so new percentage is (70/120)*100 = 58.333...%, which is 58.3%. So the answer is A.\n\nWait, but another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering that his spending increases proportionally. For example, if his income goes up by 20%, he might choose to spend more, but the question doesn't say that. It just says his income increases by 20%, so I think the correct approach is to keep the absolute expenditure the same.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A) 58.3%.\n\n\nThe problem involves a man who initially spends 70% of his income. When his income increases by 20%, the task is to determine his new expenditure percentage. \n\nTo solve this, assume the man's initial income is $100. He spends 70% of this, which equals $70. After a 20% increase in income, his new income becomes $120. If his absolute expenditure remains the same at $70, the new expenditure percentage is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{New expenditure percentage} = \\frac{\\text{Expenditure}}{\\text{New income}} \\times 100 = \\frac{70}{120} \\times 100 = 58.333\\%.\n\\]\n\nThis corresponds to option A. The problem does not indicate that the man's expenditure increases proportionally with his income, so the assumption is that his absolute expenditure remains constant. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: A",

Then his income increases by 20%, and I need to find out what his new expenditure percentage is. The options are A to E, all percentages.\n\nHmm, right. So, the man's current expenditure is 70% of his income. That means he's saving the remaining 30%, right? Because 100% minus 70% is 30%. But the question is about what happens when his income increases by 20%. Wait, does his expenditure also increase, or does the percentage change?\n\nI think the key here is whether his expenditure increases in absolute terms or as a percentage. The question says, \"what will be his new expenditure?\" So I think it's asking for the percentage of his new income that he still spends. Because if his income goes up but his spending doesn't change, then his percentage would decrease. But if his spending also increases proportionally, then the percentage would stay the same. But I don't think that's the case here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem doesn't say anything about his expenditure increasing or decreasing in absolute terms. It just says his income increases by 20%. So I think the assumption is that his absolute expenditure remains the same, but now it's a smaller percentage of his higher income.\n\nSo, let's break it down with numbers to make it clear. Let's say his original income is, for example, $100. Because using 100 makes percentages easy to calculate.\n\nOriginal income: $100.\nHe spends 70% of that, which is $70. So he saves $30.\n\nNow, his income increases by 20%. So 20% of $100 is $20. So his new income is $120.\n\nAssuming his expenditure doesn't change (he still spends the same amount in dollars), he would still spend $70. But now, the question is what percentage of his new income is this $70.\n\nSo, to calculate the new expenditure percentage: (70 / 120) * 100.\n\nLet me compute that. 70 divided by 120 equals approximately 0.583333. Multiply by 100 gives 58.333...%, which is about 58.3%.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 58.3%. So that's the answer, right?\n\nWait, but I should make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my assumptions. Because sometimes, the way the question is phrased can be tricky. For example, sometimes \"expenditure\" might refer to the actual amount spent, not the percentage. But the question says \"what will be his new expenditure?\" without specifying whether it's the amount or the percentage. However, looking at the options, they are all percentages, which suggests that the question is asking for the percentage of income spent.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had said he increases his expenditure by 20%, that would be different. But that's not the case here. The income increases by 20%, and the problem is about his new expenditure as a percentage of income.\n\nSo, my calculation seems correct. Original income $100, 70% spent. New income $120, same $70 spent. 70/120 is 58.3%, so option A.\n",

If his income increases by 20%, what will be his new expenditure? The options are A to E, and I need to pick the right one.\n\nHmm, I think I should start by understanding what the question is asking. The man's income is going up by 20%, and we need to find out what percentage of his new income he will spend, assuming his spending habits stay the same. Wait, no, actually, wait. Does his expenditure increase by the same percentage, or does his spending pattern change? Or is the problem suggesting that his expenditure is a fixed amount, so when his income goes up, the percentage of his income he spends changes?\n\nWait, maybe I should think about this in terms of absolute numbers. Let's say the man's original income is I. He spends 70% of that, which is 0.7I. So his savings would be 30% of I, which is 0.3I.\n\nNow, his income increases by 20%. So the new income is I plus 20% of I, which is I * 1.2. So the new income is 1.2I.\n\nIf his spending remains the same as before, which was 0.7I, then his new expenditure as a percentage of his new income would be (0.7I) / (1.2I).

The options are 58.3% (option A), 62.5% (B), etc. So maybe 58.3% is the correct answer, which would be option A. But wait, let me think again. Because the way the question is phrased, it says \"what will be his new expenditure?\" So is the question asking about the new percentage of his income he spends, or is it asking about the absolute amount he spends?\n\nWait, no, the original problem says he spends 70% of his income. So when his income changes, his spending would be 70% of the new income if his habits remain the same. But wait, that's not what I calculated earlier. Oh wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's expenditure is fixed, and when his income increases, the percentage of income he spends decreases. But the question isn't clear on that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that his spending increases by the same 20%, but that's not what the question says. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's restate the problem. The man currently spends 70% of his income. So if his income is I, he spends 0.7I. Now, his income increases by 20%, so new income is 1.2I. Assuming his spending remains the same (i.e., he continues to spend 0.7I), then the new percentage is (0.7I)/(1.2I) = 0.7/1.2 = 58.333...% So that would be option A, 58.3%.\n\nBut wait, that's if his spending remains the same as before. But perhaps the question is implying that his expenditure increases in the same way as his income. Wait, the wording is: \"If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" It doesn't specify whether the expenditure increases by the same 20%, or if he continues to spend the same amount. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think again. If his income goes up by 20%, and he decides to spend 20% more as well. But that would be a different calculation. But that's not what the question says. The question says he spends 70% of his income. So if his income increases, but he continues to spend the same proportion, then his absolute spending increases, but as a percentage of his new income, it's lower.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify. Let's assume that his spending is a fixed proportion of his income. So initially, 70% of I is spent. If I increases to 1.2I, then the amount he spends is 70% of 1.2I, which is 0.7 * 1.2 I = 0.84 I. So his expenditure in absolute terms is 0.84 I. But the question is, what's his new expenditure as a percentage of his income. So the percentage is (0.7 * 1.2 I ) / (1.2 I) = 0.7, which is 70% again. So that would mean that the percentage remains the same, which would be 70%, but that's not one of the options. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the options don't have 70%. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is that the man's expenditure increases by 20% as well, but that's not what the question says. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that he continues to spend the same absolute amount, but the percentage of his income that he spends decreases.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this with numbers. Let me pick an income, say, $100. Then 70% of that is $70 spent. Now, his income increases by 20%, so new income is $120. If he continues to spend the same absolute amount, $70, then the percentage is 70/120 = 58.333...%, which is 58.3%. That matches option A. But if his spending increases proportionally, then he would spend 70% of $120, which is $84, which is 70% of his new income, but that's not one of the options. So the question is probably asking for the case where he spends the same absolute amount as before, so the percentage decreases.\n\nWait, but the original question says \"he spends 70% of his income.\" So if his income increases, then his spending would also increase as 70% of the new income. So in that case, the percentage would remain the same, 70%. But that's not an option either. So I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's expenditure is fixed, so he continues to spend the same amount regardless of his income. Then, when his income increases, the percentage of his income that he spends would decrease. So let's model that.\n\nLet me take his original income as I. He spends 70% of I, which is 0.7I. Now, his income increases by 20%, so new income is 1.2I. He continues to spend 0.7I. So the new percentage is (0.7I) / (1.2I) = 0.7 / 1.2 \u2248 0.583333, which is 58.333...% So that's 58.3%, option A.\n\nSo the correct answer would be option A.\n\nWait, but why would his expenditure remain the same? The question doesn't say that. The question says he spends 70% of his income. So if his income changes, his spending would change accordingly. So when his income increases, he would spend 70% of the new income, which is more than before, so the percentage remains 70%. But that's not one of the options. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is that the man's expenditure is a fixed amount, and when his income increases, the percentage of income spent decreases. So if his income increases by 20%, his expenditure remains the same, so the percentage becomes (same expenditure)/(new income) = (0.7I) / (1.2 I) = 0.583333, which is 58.3%. So that's option A.\n\nBut the original problem says he spends 70% of his income. So that implies that his expenditure is 70% of his income. So when his income increases, his expenditure also increases by 70% of the new income. So the percentage remains 70%, but the absolute amount spent increases.\n\nWait, but the question is asking what is his new expenditure. So if his income increases, and his expenditure is 70% of that, then the percentage is 70%, which isn't an option. So perhaps the question is implying that his expenditure remains the same as before, so he spends the same amount, but as a percentage of his new income, it's lower.\n\nWait, but the question doesn't state that. So perhaps I should look at the problem again.\n\nProblem statement: A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\n\nHmm, perhaps the question is saying that his expenditure is 70% of his income, so when his income increases by 20%, his expenditure also increases by 20% (since it's a percentage of his income). So, for example, if he was earning $100, he spends $70. If his income increases by 20%, to $120, he would spend 70% of that, which is $84. So his new expenditure is $84. But the question is asking for the percentage of his new income, which would be 70%, which isn't one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the original income, but that doesn't make much sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is implying that his expenditure increases by 20%, not that his income increases. So if his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by the same 20%, then his new expenditure would be 70% of his original income plus 20% of that, which is 84% of the original income. But that would be 84%, which isn't an option either.\n\nI'm getting more confused. Let me try another approach. Maybe the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure is fixed. So let's say his original income is I, and he spends E = 0.7I. Now, his income increases to 1.2I, but he still spends E. So his new expenditure as a percentage of his new income is E/(1.2I) = (0.7I)/(1.2I) = 0.7/1.2 \u2248 58.333% which is 58.3%, option A.\n\nBut the question says he spends 70% of his income. So if his income increases, wouldn't his expenditure increase as well? So the problem must be that his expenditure as a percentage of income remains the same. So his new expenditure is 70% of 1.2I, which is 0.84I. So the percentage is 70%, which isn't an option. So I must be misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the absolute increase in expenditure, not the percentage. But the options are percentages, so that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the question is implying that the man's spending remains the same, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for another way. Let me think about this as a proportion. Let me say his initial income is 100 units. So he spends 70 units. Now, his income increases by 20%, so it's 120 units. If his spending remains the same as before (70 units), then the new percentage is 70/120 = 58.333...% So that's option A.\n\nBut why would his spending remain the same? The problem states that he spends 70% of his income. So when his income increases, his spending should also increase, as it's a percentage of his income. So in that case, his new spending is 70% of 120, which is 84 units. So his new expenditure is 84 units, but the question is asking for the percentage of his new income, which is 70%, which isn't an option. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, but the options don't include 70%, so perhaps the question is implying that his expenditure remains the same, and we need to find the new percentage. So if he continues to spend 70 units when his income is now 120 units, then the new percentage is 70/120 = 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer is A)58.3%.\n\nBut why would the problem state that he spends 70% of his income, and then have his income increase without changing his spending? That seems contradictory. Because if he's spending 70% of his income, and his income increases, his spending should also increase proportionally.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think again. The problem says: he spends 70% of his income. So when his income increases, his expenditure also increases by the same percentage. So his new expenditure is 70% of his new income, which is 70% of 1.2I, which is 0.84I. So the percentage is 70%, but that's not an option. So I must be missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the question is phrased differently. Perhaps it's a trick question. Let me think: the man spends 70% of his income. So his initial income is I, spending is 0.7I. If his income increases by 20%, new income is 1.2I. Now, the problem asks, what will be his new expenditure? The options are percentages, but perhaps the question is asking for the absolute increase in expenditure, not the percentage.\n\nWait, no, the options are percentages, so that can't be. So perhaps the problem is that the man's expenditure is fixed, and the question is asking what percentage of his new income is this fixed expenditure. So if his income increases by 20%, and he continues to spend the same amount, then the percentage is lower.\n\nLet me take I=100, spending=70. New income=120, spending remains 70. So 70/120=58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nSo the answer must be option A.\n",

Or is the problem suggesting that his expenditure is a fixed amount, so when his income goes up, the percentage of his income he spends changes?\n\nWait, maybe I should think about this in terms of absolute numbers. Let's say the man's original income is I. He spends 70% of that, which is 0.7I. So his savings would be 30% of I, which is 0.3I.\n\nNow, his income increases by 20%. So the new income is I plus 20% of I, which is I * 1.2. So the new income is 1.2I.\n\nIf his spending remains the same as before, which was 0.7I, then his new expenditure as a percentage of his new income would be (0.7I) / (1.2I). The I cancels out, so it's 0.7 / 1.2. Let me calculate that. 0.7 divided by 1.2 is equal to 0.583333..., which is approximately 58.333...%.\n\nWait, but that's not one of the options. The options are 58.3% (option A), 62.5% (B), etc. So maybe 58.3% is the correct answer, which would be option A. But wait, let me think again. Because the way the question is phrased, it says \"what will be his new expenditure?\" So is the question asking about the new percentage of his income he spends, or is it asking about the absolute amount he spends?\n\nWait, no, the original problem says he spends 70% of his income. So when his income changes, his spending would be 70% of the new income if his habits remain the same. But wait, that's not what I calculated earlier. Oh wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's expenditure is fixed, and when his income increases, the percentage of income he spends decreases. But the question isn't clear on that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that his spending increases by the same 20%, but that's not what the question says. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's restate the problem. The man currently spends 70% of his income. So if his income is I, he spends 0.7I. Now, his income increases by 20%, so new income is 1.2I. Assuming his spending remains the same (i.e., he continues to spend 0.7I), then the new percentage is (0.7I)/(1.2I) = 0.7/1.2 = 58.333...% So that would be option A, 58.3%.\n\nBut wait, that's if his spending remains the same as before. But perhaps the question is implying that his expenditure increases in the same way as his income. Wait, the wording is: \"If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" It doesn't specify whether the expenditure increases by the same 20%, or if he continues to spend the same amount. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think again. If his income goes up by 20%, and he decides to spend 20% more as well. But that would be a different calculation. But that's not what the question says. The question says he spends 70% of his income. So if his income increases, but he continues to spend the same proportion, then his absolute spending increases, but as a percentage of his new income, it's lower.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify. Let's assume that his spending is a fixed proportion of his income. So initially, 70% of I is spent. If I increases to 1.2I, then the amount he spends is 70% of 1.2I, which is 0.7 * 1.2 I = 0.84 I. So his expenditure in absolute terms is 0.84 I. But the question is, what's his new expenditure as a percentage of his income. So the percentage is (0.7 * 1.2 I ) / (1.2 I) = 0.7, which is 70% again. So that would mean that the percentage remains the same, which would be 70%, but that's not one of the options. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the options don't have 70%. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is that the man's expenditure increases by 20% as well, but that's not what the question says. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that he continues to spend the same absolute amount, but the percentage of his income that he spends decreases.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this with numbers. Let me pick an income, say, $100. Then 70% of that is $70 spent. Now, his income increases by 20%, so new income is $120. If he continues to spend the same absolute amount, $70, then the percentage is 70/120 = 58.333...%, which is 58.3%. That matches option A. But if his spending increases proportionally, then he would spend 70% of $120, which is $84, which is 70% of his new income, but that's not one of the options. So the question is probably asking for the case where he spends the same absolute amount as before, so the percentage decreases.\n\nWait, but the original question says \"he spends 70% of his income.\" So if his income increases, then his spending would also increase as 70% of the new income. So in that case, the percentage would remain the same, 70%. But that's not an option either. So I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's expenditure is fixed, so he continues to spend the same amount regardless of his income. Then, when his income increases, the percentage of his income that he spends would decrease. So let's model that.\n\nLet me take his original income as I. He spends 70% of I, which is 0.7I. Now, his income increases by 20%, so new income is 1.2I. He continues to spend 0.7I. So the new percentage is (0.7I) / (1.2I) = 0.7 / 1.2 \u2248 0.583333, which is 58.333...% So that's 58.3%, option A.\n\nSo the correct answer would be option A.\n\nWait, but why would his expenditure remain the same? The question doesn't say that. The question says he spends 70% of his income. So if his income changes, his spending would change accordingly. So when his income increases, he would spend 70% of the new income, which is more than before, so the percentage remains 70%. But that's not one of the options. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is that the man's expenditure is a fixed amount, and when his income increases, the percentage of income spent decreases. So if his income increases by 20%, his expenditure remains the same, so the percentage becomes (same expenditure)/(new income) = (0.7I) / (1.2 I) = 0.583333, which is 58.3%. So that's option A.\n\nBut the original problem says he spends 70% of his income. So that implies that his expenditure is 70% of his income. So when his income increases, his expenditure also increases by 70% of the new income. So the percentage remains 70%, but the absolute amount spent increases.\n\nWait, but the question is asking what is his new expenditure. So if his income increases, and his expenditure is 70% of that, then the percentage is 70%, which isn't an option. So perhaps the question is implying that his expenditure remains the same as before, so he spends the same amount, but as a percentage of his new income, it's lower.\n\nWait, but the question doesn't state that. So perhaps I should look at the problem again.\n\nProblem statement: A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\n\nHmm, perhaps the question is saying that his expenditure is 70% of his income, so when his income increases by 20%, his expenditure also increases by 20% (since it's a percentage of his income). So, for example, if he was earning $100, he spends $70. If his income increases by 20%, to $120, he would spend 70% of that, which is $84. So his new expenditure is $84. But the question is asking for the percentage of his new income, which would be 70%, which isn't one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the original income, but that doesn't make much sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is implying that his expenditure increases by 20%, not that his income increases. So if his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by the same 20%, then his new expenditure would be 70% of his original income plus 20% of that, which is 84% of the original income. But that would be 84%, which isn't an option either.\n\nI'm getting more confused. Let me try another approach. Maybe the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure is fixed. So let's say his original income is I, and he spends E = 0.7I. Now, his income increases to 1.2I, but he still spends E. So his new expenditure as a percentage of his new income is E/(1.2I) = (0.7I)/(1.2I) = 0.7/1.2 \u2248 58.333% which is 58.3%, option A.\n\nBut the question says he spends 70% of his income. So if his income increases, wouldn't his expenditure increase as well? So the problem must be that his expenditure as a percentage of income remains the same. So his new expenditure is 70% of 1.2I, which is 0.84I. So the percentage is 70%, which isn't an option. So I must be misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the absolute increase in expenditure, not the percentage. But the options are percentages, so that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the question is implying that the man's spending remains the same, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for another way. Let me think about this as a proportion. Let me say his initial income is 100 units. So he spends 70 units. Now, his income increases by 20%, so it's 120 units. If his spending remains the same as before (70 units), then the new percentage is 70/120 = 58.333...% So that's option A.\n\nBut why would his spending remain the same? The problem states that he spends 70% of his income. So when his income increases, his spending should also increase, as it's a percentage of his income. So in that case, his new spending is 70% of 120, which is 84 units. So his new expenditure is 84 units, but the question is asking for the percentage of his new income, which is 70%, which isn't an option. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, but the options don't include 70%, so perhaps the question is implying that his expenditure remains the same, and we need to find the new percentage. So if he continues to spend 70 units when his income is now 120 units, then the new percentage is 70/120 = 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer is A)58.3%.\n\nBut why would the problem state that he spends 70% of his income, and then have his income increase without changing his spending? That seems contradictory. Because if he's spending 70% of his income, and his income increases, his spending should also increase proportionally.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think again. The problem says: he spends 70% of his income. So when his income increases, his expenditure also increases by the same percentage. So his new expenditure is 70% of his new income, which is 70% of 1.2I, which is 0.84I. So the percentage is 70%, but that's not an option. So I must be missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the question is phrased differently. Perhaps it's a trick question. Let me think: the man spends 70% of his income. So his initial income is I, spending is 0.7I. If his income increases by 20%, new income is 1.2I. Now, the problem asks, what will be his new expenditure? The options are percentages, but perhaps the question is asking for the absolute increase in expenditure, not the percentage.\n\nWait, no, the options are percentages, so that can't be. So perhaps the problem is that the man's expenditure is fixed, and the question is asking what percentage of his new income is this fixed expenditure. So if his income increases by 20%, and he continues to spend the same amount, then the percentage is lower.\n\nLet me take I=100, spending=70. New income=120, spending remains 70. So 70/120=58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nSo the answer must be option A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given information:\n\n1. The man spends **70% of his income**. Let his original income be \\( I \\). Therefore, his expenditure is \\( 0.7I \\).\n\n2. His income increases by **20%**, so the new income is \\( 1.2I \\).\n\n3. The question asks for his **new expenditure**. There are two interpretations:\n   - If his spending remains the same absolute amount (\\( 0.7I \\)), then the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{New expenditure percentage} = \\frac{0.7I}{1.2I} = \\frac{0.7}{1.2} \\approx 0.583333 \\, (\\text{or } 58.3\\%).\n     \\]\n   - If his spending continues to be **70% of his income**, then his new expenditure is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{New expenditure} = 0.7 \\times 1.2I = 0.84I.\n     \\]\n     However, this would mean his expenditure as a percentage of his new income remains **70%**, which is not one of the answer choices.\n\nGiven the options provided, the problem likely assumes that his spending remains the same absolute amount (\\( 0.7I \\)) while his income increases. This makes the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income equal to **58.3%**, which corresponds to option **A**.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: A**",
