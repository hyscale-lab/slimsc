      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it again and try to figure it out step by step. \n\nThe problem says Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. The yard has an area of 240 square meters. We need to find out how many meters of fencing she needs.\n\nHmm, right. So it's a rectangle, and three sides are to be fenced. One side is left open, and that side is 10 meters. Wait, but which side is that? Because in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So if the open side is 10 meters, that's either the length or the width.\n\nWait, let me think. Let's denote the sides. Let me visualize the rectangle. Suppose the yard is longer in one direction, so maybe the two lengths and one width are fenced, leaving the other width open. Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, the problem doesn't specify which side is left open, but since it's a rectangle, it probably doesn't matter as long as the dimensions add up.\n\nLet me try to assign variables. Let's say the side that's left unfenced is the width. So, the width (W) is 10 meters. Then the opposite side is also 10 meters, but that's fenced because all three sides are fenced except one. Wait, no. Wait, the fencing is around three sides. So if the yard is a rectangle, it has two lengths and two widths. If one width is left unfenced, then the other three sides (two lengths and one width) are fenced. Or maybe one length is left unfenced, and the other three (two widths and one length) are fenced.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify. The problem says she's fencing three sides and leaving one side of 10 meters unfenced. So the unfenced side is either a length or a width.\n\nLet me approach this systematically.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the length as L and the width as W.\n\nCase 1: The unfenced side is the width. So, W = 10 m. Then the fencing would be around the other three sides: two lengths and one width. So total fencing needed would be 2L + W.\n\nCase 2: The unfenced side is the length. So, L = 10 m. Then fencing would be two widths and one length: 2W + L.\n\nBut we don't know which case it is. So perhaps I need to consider both possibilities and see which one fits the area.\n\nWe know that the area is length \u00d7 width = 240 m\u00b2.\n\nLet me first try case 1: W =10 m.\n\nThen, area is L * 10 = 240 \u2192 L = 240 /10 =24 m.\n\nSo the fencing would be 2L + W = 2*24 +10 =48+10=58 meters.\n\nWait, but the options include 58 as option A. But wait, let me check the other case.\n\nCase 2: L=10 m.\n\nArea would be 10 * W =240 \u2192 W=24 m.\n\nFencing needed: 2W + L =2*24 +10=48+10=58 meters. Oh, same result.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Both cases give the same amount of fencing. So regardless of whether the 10m is the length or the width, the total fencing needed is 58 meters. So the answer would be A)58.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Because sometimes, perhaps, one case isn't possible. Let me think again.\n\nIn case 1, W=10 m, L=24 m. The fencing is 2L + W = 2*24 +10=58.\n\nIn case 2, L=10 m, W=24 m. Fencing is 2W + L= 2*24 +10=58.\n\nYes, same result. So the answer is 58, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again, option A is 58, which is what I got. So why is option A correct?\n\nWait, but I remember that sometimes when you have a rectangle and you're fencing three sides, the orientation matters. Let me see if the problem implies which side is left open.\n\nThe problem says she's leaving one side of 10 meters unfenced. It doesn't specify which, so both cases are possible, but in both cases, the fencing comes out the same. So regardless of whether the 10m is the length or the width, the total fencing is 58.\n\nSo the correct answer should be A)58.\n",

The area of the yard is 240 square meters. I need to find out how much fencing she needs.\n\nHmm, let's think. Since it's a rectangle, the opposite sides are equal. So if one of the unfenced sides is 10 meters, I guess that's one of the lengths. Wait, no\u2014wait, wait. The problem says she's leaving one side of 10 meters unfenced. So that side is either the length or the width. But she's fencing three sides. So the fencing will cover two lengths and one width, or two widths and one length.\n\nWait, let me visualize this. Imagine the yard is a rectangle. She leaves one side (let's say the width) unfenced. So she's fencing the other three sides: two lengths and one width. Or wait, maybe she's leaving a length side unfenced. So she's fencing two widths and one length. Hmm, but which one is which?\n\nI think the key is to figure out the dimensions. Let me denote the sides. Let's say the yard has a length 'L' and a width 'W'. The unfenced side is 10 meters, so either L=10 or W=10. But which one is it?\n\nWait, but the area is 240. So if the unfenced side is one of the sides, perhaps it's the length. Let's try that.\n\nCase 1: Unfenced side is the length (L=10 m). Then, the area is L * W = 240 \u2192 10 * W = 240 \u2192 W=24 meters.\n\nIn this case, the fencing would be for the other three sides: two widths (each 24 m) and one length (10 m). So fencing needed = 2W + L = 2*24 +10 =48 +10=58 meters.\n\nWait, but that's one of the options. Option A is 58. Hmm.\n\nCase 2: What if the unfenced side is the width (W=10 m). Then, area L * W =240 \u2192 L=240/10=24 m.\n\nIn this case, fencing would be two lengths (each 24 m) and one width (10 m). So fencing is 2L + W = 2*24 +10=48 +10=58 meters again. Wait, same result. So either way, fencing needed is 58 meters.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because depending on whether the unfenced side is length or width, the fencing would change. Oh wait, in both cases, the total fencing comes out the same. Because 2*24 +10 = same as 2*10 +24? No, wait no. Wait, in case 1: L=10, W=24. Fencing is 2*W + L \u2192 2*24 +10=58.\n\nIn case 2: W=10, L=24. Fencing is 2*L + W \u21922*24 +10=58. So both cases give the same fencing length. Interesting.\n\nSo the answer would be 58 meters, which is option A.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The problem says she's fencing three sides. So she leaves one side of 10 meters unfenced. So it doesn't matter which side it is, because the fencing comes out the same. So yeah, 58 meters is the answer.\n\n\nTo determine how much fencing Alice needs, we analyze the problem as follows:\n\nAlice is fencing three sides of her rectangular yard, leaving one side of 10 meters unfenced. The yard has an area of 240 square meters. Let the length and width of the yard be denoted as \\( L \\) and \\( W \\), respectively. The unfenced side could be either \\( L \\) or \\( W \\), and we consider both cases:\n\n### Case 1: Unfenced side is the length (\\( L = 10 \\, \\text{m} \\))\nThe area of the yard is given by:\n\\[\nL \\times W = 240 \\implies 10 \\times W = 240 \\implies W = 24 \\, \\text{m}.\n\\]\nIn this case, the fencing required covers two widths and one length:\n\\[\n\\text{Fencing} = 2W + L = 2 \\times 24 + 10 = 48 + 10 = 58 \\, \\text{m}.\n\\]\n\n### Case 2: Unfenced side is the width (\\( W = 10 \\, \\text{m} \\))\nThe area of the yard is given by:\n\\[\nL \\times W = 240 \\implies L \\times 10 = 240 \\implies L = 24 \\, \\text{m}.\n\\]\nIn this case, the fencing required covers two lengths and one width:\n\\[\n\\text{Fencing} = 2L + W = 2 \\times 24 + 10 = 48 + 10 = 58 \\, \\text{m}.\n\\]\n\nIn both cases, the total fencing required is \\( 58 \\, \\text{m} \\).

So, the yard is rectangular, and she's putting fencing around three sides, leaving one side of 10 meters unfenced. The area is 240 square meters. Right.\n\nWait, so she's leaving one side unfenced. Which side is that? Well, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So, if it's a rectangle, maybe the side she's leaving is one of the longer sides or one of the shorter ones. Hmm. But the problem doesn't specify, so I guess I have to consider both possibilities.\n\nBut wait, maybe the 10 meters is the length of the side that's unfenced. So, that could be either the length or the width. Hmm. Let me think. Let's denote the sides. Suppose the yard has a length L and a width W. The area is L multiplied by W, so L*W = 240.\n\nShe's fencing three sides. If the unfenced side is of length 10 meters, then that could be either L or W. Let me consider both cases.\n\nCase 1: The unfenced side is the length (L) of 10 meters. Then, the area equation becomes 10 * W = 240. So W would be 240/10 = 24 meters. Then, the fencing needed would be for the other two widths and the other length. So, fencing length = L + 2W. Wait, wait, no. Wait, three sides: if the yard is rectangular and she's fencing three sides, which sides are they? Oh, probably two widths and one length. Because in a rectangle, if you leave one length unfenced, the fencing would be the other length and both widths. Or wait, maybe she's leaving a width unfenced. Hmm, I think I need to clarify.\n\nWait, the question says she's fencing three sides and leaving one side of 10m unfenced. So, three sides are fenced, and one is not. So, the yard has four sides, but one is left open. So, which arrangement gives the fencing?\n\nIf the unfenced side is a length, then the fencing would be the opposite length and the two widths. Or, if the unfenced side is a width, then the fencing would be the opposite width and the two lengths.\n\nWait, but that depends on which side is left. So, perhaps I should model it more carefully.\n\nLet me define the sides: Let's say the yard has two lengths (L) and two widths (W). So, the perimeter is 2L + 2W, but she's fencing only three sides. Which three? Maybe she's fencing one length and both widths, or both lengths and one width. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem states that she's fencing three sides. If the unfenced side is one of the lengths (L=10), then the fencing would be the other length (L) and both widths (W each). So the fencing length would be L + 2W. Alternatively, if the unfenced side is a width (W=10), then the fencing would be the other width (W) and both lengths (L each), so fencing length would be 2L + W.\n\nBut which case applies here? Since the problem says she leaves one side of 10m unfenced. So that could be either L or W.\n\nWait, but in the first case, when L is 10, the area is 240, so W is 24, as I calculated earlier. Then, the fencing would be L + 2W = 10 + 2*24 = 10+48=58 meters. Hmm, option A is 58.\n\nIn the second case, if W is 10, then L would be 240/10=24. Then the fencing would be 2L + W = 2*24 +10=48+10=58. Wait, same result? Wait, no, wait, 2*24 is 48 plus 10 is 58. So either way, whether the 10m is the length or the width, the fencing needed is 58 meters. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nWait, is that possible? Let me double-check.\n\nCase 1: Unfenced side is length L =10 m. Area: L*W=240 \u2192 W=24. Fencing is L + 2W =10 + 48=58.\n\nCase 2: Unfenced side is width W=10 m. Area: L=240/10=24. Fencing is 2L + W=48 +10=58.\n\nSo in both cases, the fencing required is 58 meters. So the answer must be option A)58.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option A is 58.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so Alice is putting up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard, leaving one side of 10 meters unfenced. The area is 240 square meters. I need to figure out how much fencing she needs.\n\nHmm, let me visualize this. A rectangle has four sides, right? She's leaving one side unfenced, so she's fencing the other three. But which side is she leaving? It depends on whether the unfenced side is the length or the width.\n\nWait, the problem says the unfenced side is 10 meters. So one of the sides is 10m. Let me think about the possible configurations.\n\nIn a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So if the unfenced side is 10m, that could be either the length or the width. Let me denote the sides: Let's say the sides are length L and width W. Suppose the unfenced side is one of the lengths. So the fencing would cover two widths and one length, or maybe two lengths and one width. Wait, no, wait. If she's fencing three sides, it's either two of one dimension and one of the other. So if the unfenced side is, say, the length, then the fencing would be two lengths and one width? No, wait, no. Wait, the fencing is three sides. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the yard is rectangular. So imagine it's a rectangle with length L and width W. If she leaves the length (L) unfenced, then she needs fencing for the other three sides: two widths and one length. Wait, no. Wait, the sides are L and W. If the unfenced side is length L, then the other three sides are the two widths (W each) and another length (L). Wait, no, that's three sides: one L and two W's. Alternatively, if the unfenced side is a width (W), then she has two lengths and one width.\n\nBut the problem states that the unfenced side is 10 meters. So either L=10 or W=10.\n\nLet me write down the equations.\n\nCase 1: The unfenced side is L=10m. Then, the area is L * W = 240. So 10 * W =240 \u2192 W=24 m.\n\nThe fencing required would be 2W + L. Because she's fencing two widths and one length. Wait, no. Wait, the three sides she's fencing would be: the two widths and the opposite length. Because if the front length is unfenced, the fencing would be the two sides (each W) and the back length (L). So fencing is 2W + L.\n\nIn this case, W=24, L=10. So fencing = 2*24 +10 =48+10=58 meters.\n\nCase 2: The unfenced side is W=10m. Then, area is L*W=240 \u2192 L=240/10=24 m.\n\nFencing required would be 2L + W. Because she's fencing the two lengths and one width. So 2*24 +10 =48+10=58 meters.\n\nWait, that's the same as case 1? So regardless of which side is unfenced, the fencing comes to 58 meters?\n\nWait, wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, wait, in case 1, she leaves the length (10m) unfenced. The fencing is two widths (24 each) and the other length (10). So 2*24 +10 =58.\n\nIn case 2, she leaves the width (10m) unfenced. The fencing is two lengths (24 each) and the other width (10). So 2*24 +10=58 as well.\n\nSo both cases give the same fencing length of 58 meters. So the answer would be 58 meters, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because in case 1, if the unfenced side is L=10, then the fencing is 2W + L. So 2*24 +10=58. That's correct.\n\nIn case 2, unfenced is W=10, fencing is 2L + W = 2*24 +10=58. So yes, same result.\n\nSo the answer is 58 meters, option A.\n",

I need to find out how many meters of fencing she needs.\n\nHmm, let's think about the shape. A rectangle has two equal lengths and two equal widths. But since she's leaving one side unfenced, I'm guessing that side is either the length or the width. Wait, the problem says one side of 10 meters is unfenced. So that means either the length or the width is 10 meters. But wait, no, that's not necessarily the case. Because a rectangle has two sides of each, so if one side is 10 meters, the opposite side is also 10 meters. So if she leaves one side of 10m unfenced, she might be leaving one of the lengths or one of the widths.\n\nWait, but the problem says she's fencing three sides. So maybe she's leaving the fourth side as the 10 meters. Let me visualize it. Imagine the yard as a rectangle. If she leaves the top side unfenced, which is 10 meters, then she'll fence the bottom, left, and right sides. Alternatively, if she leaves the left side unfenced, then the right, top, and bottom are fenced.\n\nWait, no, actually, the problem says she leaves one side of 10 meters unfenced. So that side could be either a length or a width. So I have to figure out whether the 10 meters is the length or the width.\n\nLet me denote the sides as length (L) and width (W). So the area is L * W = 240.\n\nShe's leaving one side (either L or W) as 10 meters. So there are two possibilities:\n\nCase 1: The unfenced side is one of the lengths (L=10 m). Then the fencing would consist of two widths and one length. Wait no, if she's leaving a length (L) unfenced, then she would fence the other length and both widths. Wait, no, no. Wait, the yard is a rectangle, so she can't have just one length and two widths fenced if she's leaving a length. Because the opposite side is also a length. Wait, no, wait. Let's think again.\n\nIf the yard has two lengths and two widths. Suppose she's leaving one length (so 10 meters is a length, L=10). Then the fencing would be the other length (L) and both widths (W each). So fencing total is L + 2W. But wait, no, wait: if the yard is arranged as L and W, with two Ls and two Ws. So if she leaves one L unfenced, she must fence the other L plus both Ws. So fencing is L (the other one) + W + W = L + 2W.\n\nAlternatively, if she leaves a W of 10 meters, then the fencing is the other W plus both Ls. So fencing is 2L + W.\n\nBut wait, which case is correct? I think we need to determine whether the 10 meters is the length or the width.\n\nSo let's consider both cases.\n\nCase 1: L = 10 m.\n\nThen area is L * W = 240 \u2192 10 * W = 240 \u2192 W=24 m.\n\nFencing needed is L + 2W = 10 + 2*24 = 10 +48=58 meters.\n\nCase 2: W =10 m.\n\nThen area is L *10=240 \u2192 L=24 m.\n\nFencing needed is 2L + W = 2*24 +10=48+10=58 meters.\n\nWait, so in both cases, the fencing is 58 meters? That can't be right. Wait, wait, no. Because in case 1, she's leaving a length (10 m) unfenced, so she fences the other length and the two widths. So fencing is L + 2W \u2192 10 + (2*24) =58.\n\nIn case 2, she's leaving a width (10 m) unfenced. So she has to fence the other width and both lengths. So fencing is 2L + W \u2192 2*24 +10=58.\n\nWait, so in both cases, the fencing is 58 meters. So why are the options including higher numbers like 62, 66, etc.?\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, maybe I confused which side is left. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says she is putting up fencing around three sides and leaving one side of 10 meters unfenced. So the 10 meters is one of the sides. But depending on whether it's a length or a width, the fencing required would be different.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it with variables.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet L be the length, W be the width.\n\nShe leaves one side of 10 m unfenced. So either L=10 or W=10.\n\nCase 1: L=10.\n\nThen area is 10 * W =240 \u2192 W=24.\n\nShe needs fencing for the other length and both widths. So fencing is L + 2W =10 +48=58 m.\n\nCase 2: W=10.\n\nThen area is L *10=240 \u2192 L=24.\n\nShe needs fencing for both lengths and the other width. So fencing is 2L + W=48 +10=58 m.\n\nWait, same as case 1. So in either case, fencing is 58 m. So the answer would be 58, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, the options include A)58, B)62, etc. So 58 is an option. But that seems too straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming which sides are being fenced. Let me think again.\n\nWait, when she fences three sides, which sides? Depending on the layout, it's either two widths and one length, or two lengths and one width.\n\nBut the problem says she leaves one side of 10 meters unfenced. So the side that's left is 10 m, and the fencing is for the other three sides.\n\nWait, but in a rectangle, the opposite sides are equal. So if the unfenced side is a length (L=10), the fencing is the other length (L) and two widths (W each). So fencing is L + 2W.\n\nAlternatively, if the unfenced side is a width (W=10), fencing is 2L + W.\n\nIn either case, when you compute, both give 58 meters.\n\nWait, but maybe I got the fencing equation wrong. Let me double-check.\n\nIn case 1: L=10.\n\nSo the yard has two lengths of 10 m each and two widths of 24 m each.\n\nShe leaves one length (10 m) unfenced.

So she needs fencing for both lengths (24 each) and the other width (10). So fencing is 24 +24 +10 =58.\n\nHmm, same result. So the answer is 58 meters, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, the initial problem says three sides. So in either case, she's fencing three sides. So the calculation seems correct.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again: A)58, B)62, C)66, D)70, E)74. So 58 is an option. So I think the correct answer is A)58.\n",

To determine the total fencing required, we analyze two possible cases based on whether the 10-meter side is the length or the width.\n\n### Case 1: The 10-meter side is the length (L = 10 m)\nThe area of the yard is given by:\n\\[\nL \\times W = 240 \\implies 10 \\times W = 240 \\implies W = 24 \\, \\text{m}.\n\\]\nSince one length is left unfenced, the fencing required is for the other length and both widths:\n\\[\n\\text{Fencing} = L + 2W = 10 + 2 \\times 24 = 10 + 48 = 58 \\, \\text{m}.\n\\]\n\n### Case 2: The 10-meter side is the width (W = 10 m)\nThe area of the yard is given by:\n\\[\nL \\times W = 240 \\implies L \\times 10 = 240 \\implies L = 24 \\, \\text{m}.\n\\]\nSince one width is left unfenced, the fencing required is for both lengths and the other width:\n\\[\n\\text{Fencing} = 2L + W = 2 \\times 24 + 10 = 48 + 10 = 58 \\, \\text{m}.\n\\]\n\nIn both cases, the total fencing required is **58 meters**. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: A**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so Alice is putting up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard, leaving the fourth side unfenced. The unfenced side is 10 meters. The yard has an area of 240 square meters. I need to find out how many meters of fencing she needs.\n\nHmm, let's think. So the yard is a rectangle. Let me visualize it. A rectangle has two pairs of equal sides. Let's say the sides are length and width. But wait, in this case, one of the sides is unfenced, and that's 10 meters. So which side is it? Well, the problem doesn't specify whether it's the length or the width. But wait, in a rectangle, the sides opposite each other are the same. So if one side is 10 meters, the opposite side must also be 10 meters. But Alice is only fencing three sides, so perhaps she's leaving one of the longer sides unfenced? Or maybe one of the shorter ones. Wait, but the problem says she's leaving one side of 10 meters unfenced. So that side is 10 meters.\n\nWait, maybe it's the length that's 10 meters. Or the width. Let me think. Let me denote the sides. Let's say the yard has a length (L) and a width (W). The area is L times W, which is 240.\n\nNow, Alice is putting fencing on three sides. Let's imagine the yard. Let's say the unfenced side is the length. So she's leaving the length of 10 meters unfenced. Then the fencing would be around the two widths and one length. Wait, no\u2014wait, no, wait. If the yard is a rectangle, and she leaves one side (10 meters) unfenced, she's fencing the other three sides. So depending on which side is left, the total fencing will vary.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to define the sides. Let's say the two widths are the ones that are 10 meters each. Or maybe the length is 10 meters. Hmm, but the problem says the unfenced side is 10 meters. So perhaps it's either the length or the width.\n\nLet me think: Let's assume that the unfenced side is the length. So the length (L) is 10 meters. Then the area would be L * W = 240. So 10 * W = 240 \u2192 W = 24 meters. So the yard is 10m by 24m. Then, the fencing would be along the two widths and one length. So the fencing needed would be 2*W + L.\n\nWait, no, wait. If the unfenced side is the length, then the fencing is for the two widths and one length. So 2*W + L. Wait, but if the unfenced side is the length, then the two widths and one length are fenced. So in that case, fencing is 2*W + L. Let me calculate that.\n\nIf W is 24, then fencing is 2*24 + 10 = 48 +10 = 58 meters. So that's option A)58. But wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the unfenced side is one of the widths. Let's say the width is 10 meters. Then, the area would be L * W = 240 \u2192 L = 240 /10 =24 meters. Then, the fencing would be for the two lengths and one width. So 2*L + W = 2*24 +10 =48+10=58 meters again. Wait, same result.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Whether the unfenced side is length or width, in this particular case, the fencing comes out the same. Because in both scenarios, you're adding two of the other dimension and one of the unfenced dimension.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Let me think again. Let me model it.\n\nCase 1: Unfenced side is the length (10m). Then the area is L=10, W=24. Fencing needed is two widths (24 each) and one length (10). So 2*24 +10 =58.\n\nCase 2: Unfenced side is the width (10m). Then the area is W=10, L=24. Fencing needed is two lengths (24 each) and one width (10). So 2*24 +10=58.\n\nWait, so in both cases, the total fencing is 58 meters, which is option A. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but why are the options including higher numbers like 62, 66, etc. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check my logic again.\n\nWait, wait. Maybe I'm making a wrong assumption. Perhaps the unfenced side isn't either the length or the width but one of the sides. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nLet me denote the sides as length (L) and width (W). The area is L*W=240.\n\nAlice is fencing three sides. So, which three sides? Either two lengths and one width, or two widths and one length.\n\nBut the problem says she's leaving one side of 10 meters unfenced. So, which side is that? Let's say she leaves a length of 10m unfenced. Then, the fencing would be two widths and one length. The length is 10, so W is 240/10=24. So fencing is 2*24 +10=58.\n\nAlternatively, if she leaves a width of 10m unfenced, then fencing is two lengths and one width. So length is 240/10=24. Fencing is 2*24 +10=58.\n\nSo either way, the fencing is 58. So the answer should be A)58.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)58\n\nB)62\n\nC)66\n\nD)70\n\nE)74\n\nSo 58 is an option, so that's the answer.\n",
