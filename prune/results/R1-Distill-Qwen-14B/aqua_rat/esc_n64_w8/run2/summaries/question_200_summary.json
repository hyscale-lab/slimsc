      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details.\n\nSo there are three friends: Alan, Roger, and Peter. They're all answering a question on an exam, but each has a different way of getting the answer and a different probability of being correct.\n\nAlan is just randomly guessing. His chance of being right is 1/5. That makes sense since if there are five options, he's got a 20% chance.\n\nRoger is cheating by looking at the paper in front of him. So he's got a 2/3 chance of getting it right. Hmm, higher than Alan, which I guess makes sense because he's not just guessing.\n\nPeter is the one who actually does the calculations and marks the answer, so he's pretty reliable. His probability is 5/6. That's like 83.33%, which is quite high.\n\nThe question is asking: What's the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating? Oh right, so we're looking for the cases where someone got it right, but it wasn't because Roger cheated. So that would be Alan or Peter getting it right.\n\nWait, but how are the events connected here? Are the three friends answering the same question independently? I think so, because otherwise the problem would state some dependency. So each of them has their own probability of being correct, and their successes are independent events.\n\nSo, the total probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, would be the sum of the probabilities that either Alan got it right or Peter got it right, minus any overlap where both happened. Wait, no, because the events are independent. So the correct way is to find the probability that either Alan is correct or Peter is correct, but not Roger. Or wait, no, because the question is about the correct answer being achieved without cheating. So that would be the correct answer coming from either Alan or Peter, but not from Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the question is about the question being answered correctly but not via cheating. So that would include the cases where either Alan or Peter got it right, regardless of what Roger did. But wait, no, because if Roger cheated and got it right, that's a case of cheating contributing to the correct answer. So the event we want is that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter. Because if Roger got it right, that's via cheating, so we don't count that case.\n\nWait, but wait, the way the question is phrased is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?\" So I think it's the probability that the answer is correct, and that the correct answer came from either Alan or Peter, not Roger. So we need to find the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, but not considering Roger's contribution.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the way to think about it is that the question is answered correctly, but the method wasn't cheating. So the correct answer could have come from Alan, Peter, or Roger, but we only want the cases where it's Alan or Peter. But wait, no, because Roger's method is cheating. So the correct answer could be via Alan, Peter, or Roger. But we're looking for the probability that the correct answer was via Alan or Peter, i.e., not via cheating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the question is answered correctly by someone, but that someone is not Roger. Wait, but the question is whether the correct answer was achieved without cheating. So if Roger cheated and got it right, that's via cheating. So we want the correct answer to have come from either Alan or Peter. So the probability would be the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, but Roger is not. Or wait, no. Because if the question is answered correctly, it could be that any one of them got it right. But if Roger is the one who got it right via cheating, then that's via cheating. So the total correct answers could be from any of the three, but we want only those where it's from Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but the problem is phrased as \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer was achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger did. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer was achieved by someone, but the method used wasn't cheating. So the correct answer could be achieved by Alan or Peter, but not Roger. So the events would be the cases where Alan is correct OR Peter is correct, but not Roger. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right way to model it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by someone, and we want the probability that it's achieved by Alan or Peter, i.e., not via cheating.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's model all possibilities.\n\nEach of the three can be correct or not. The events are independent because each person's success is independent of the others.\n\nWe want the probability that the question is answered correctly (i.e., at least one of them is correct) but the method wasn't cheating. Wait, no, perhaps not. Wait, the problem is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but the correct answer was not via cheating. So if the correct answer came from either Alan or Peter, that's acceptable. If it came from Roger via cheating, that's not acceptable.\n\nWait, but perhaps the correct answer is achieved by someone, regardless of who. But the way the question is phrased is a bit unclear. Let me rephrase the question: what is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but the correct answer wasn't obtained through cheating. So, the correct answer could have come from Alan or Peter. So we need to find the probability that either Alan is correct or Peter is correct, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not, but we don't want the cases where the correct answer came via Roger.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly right. Because the correct answer could be achieved by both Alan and Roger. So in that case, the correct answer was achieved via both Alan (non-cheating) and Roger (cheating). But the question is, does that count as a correct answer via cheating? Hmm, but the question is whether the correct answer was obtained via cheating. So if the correct answer came via Roger, that's via cheating. But if it came via Alan, that's not. But the problem is, the question is answered correctly, but the method used wasn't cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan OR Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct. Because if the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, then it's correct and not via cheating. But if Roger is the one who got it right, then it's via cheating.\n\nBut wait, that's not entirely accurate. Because the correct answer could be achieved by both Alan and Peter, but not Roger. So the probability that the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter is the probability that either Alan is correct, Peter is correct, or both.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The way the problem is phrased is: the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer was achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's correctness. So the correct way is to calculate the probability that either Alan is correct OR Peter is correct, minus the cases where both are correct but also Roger is correct. Wait, no, because that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer was achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's actions.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to model this with probabilities.\n\nEach person has their own probability of being correct:\n\n- Alan: 1/5\n- Roger: 2/3\n- Peter: 5/6\n\nThe events are independent, so the probabilities multiply when considering combinations.\n\nWe want the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating. So that would be the probability that the correct answer was achieved by Alan or Peter. But wait, what if both Alan and Peter got it right? Then the correct answer was achieved by both, but since the question is just about whether it's correct and not via cheating, that would count as a success.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way to model it is that the question is considered correctly answered if at least one of the three got it right. But among those cases, we want the ones where the correct answer was not via cheating. So the correct answer was via Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, that's a different approach. So the total probability that the question is answered correctly is the probability that at least one of Alan, Roger, or Peter got it right. But we want the probability that, given the question is correct, it was not via cheating. So perhaps it's conditional probability.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So that's the same as the probability that the question is correctly answered by Alan or Peter, without considering Roger's method. Or perhaps, more accurately, the correct answer was achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger's answer was correct.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about it in terms of events.\n\nLet A be the event that Alan is correct.\n\nLet R be the event that Roger is correct.\n\nLet P be the event that Peter is correct.\n\nWe want the probability that the question is answered correctly (i.e., A \u2228 R \u2228 P is true) but not via cheating. So via cheating would be R being true. So the correct answer is achieved without cheating if it's achieved by A or P, regardless of R.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly correct because if R is true, then the correct answer was via cheating. But if the question is answered correctly, it could be that multiple people got it right. So the question is, when the question is answered correctly, what is the probability that it's because of Alan or Peter, not because of Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a conditional probability. So the probability that the correct answer was via non-cheating (A or P) given that the question is answered correctly.\n\nSo that would be P(A \u2228 P) / P(A \u2228 R \u2228 P).\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So perhaps that's the same as the probability that (A \u2228 P) is true, without considering R. No, because the question is answered correctly, so that's (A \u2228 R \u2228 P). But we want the probability that the correct answer wasn't via cheating, which would be (A \u2228 P) minus any overlap where R is also correct. Or perhaps more accurately, it's the probability that (A \u2228 P) is true and R is not necessarily considered.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach.\n\nThe question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but the method wasn't cheating. So the correct answer was achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger also got it right.\n\nWait, no. Because if the correct answer was achieved via both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating, so we wouldn't want that case. So the correct way is to find the probability that the correct answer was achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. Because if Roger's answer is correct, then the method was cheating.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me think in terms of cases.\n\nThe correct answer could be achieved in several ways:\n\n1. Only Alan is correct.\n\n2. Only Peter is correct.\n\n3. Both Alan and Peter are correct.\n\n4. Alan and Roger are correct.\n\n5. Peter and Roger are correct.\n\n6. All three are correct.\n\n7. Only Roger is correct.\n\n8. None are correct.\n\nWe want the cases where the correct answer is achieved without cheating, which would be cases 1, 2, 3. Because in those cases, the correct answer came from Alan and/or Peter, not via Roger's cheating. So the probability we're looking for is the sum of the probabilities of cases 1, 2, and 3.\n\nSo, let's compute each of these cases.\n\nCase 1: Only Alan is correct. That means Alan is correct (1/5), Roger is incorrect (1 - 2/3 = 1/3), and Peter is incorrect (1 - 5/6 = 1/6).\n\nProbability = (1/5) * (1/3) * (1/6) = (1) / (5*3*6) = 1/90.\n\nCase 2: Only Peter is correct. Alan is incorrect (4/5), Roger incorrect (1/3), Peter correct (5/6).\n\nProbability = (4/5) * (1/3) * (5/6) = (4 * 1 *5) / (5 *3 *6) ) = (20)/(90) = 2/9.\n\nWait, let me compute that again. (4/5) * (1/3) = 4/(15). Then 4/(15) * 5/6 = (4*5)/(15*6) = 20/90 = 2/9. Correct.\n\nCase 3: Both Alan and Peter are correct. So Alan correct (1/5), Roger incorrect (1/3), Peter correct (5/6).\n\nProbability = (1/5) * (1/3) * (5/6) = (1 * 1 *5) / (5 *3 *6) ) = 5/(90) = 1/18.\n\nSo the total probability for cases 1, 2, 3 is 1/90 + 2/9 + 1/18.\n\nLet me convert all to 90 denominator.\n\n1/90 is 1/90.\n\n2/9 is 20/90.\n\n1/18 is 5/90.\n\nSo sum is 1 + 20 +5 =26, so 26/90. Simplify that, 13/45.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nCase 1: 1/5 * 1/3 * 1/6 = 1/(5*3*6) = 1/90.\n\nCase 2: (4/5) * (1/3) * (5/6) \u2192 Let's compute this.\n\n(4/5) * (1/3) = 4/(15). Multiply by 5/6: 4/(15) *5/6 = (4*5)/(15*6) )= 20/90 = 2/9.\n\nCase 3: (1/5) * (1/3) * (5/6) = (1*1*5)/(5*3*6) )=5/(90)=1/18.\n\nSo sum is 1/90 + 2/9 + 1/18.\n\nConvert all to 90ths.\n\n1/90 is 1.\n\n2/9 is 20/90.\n\n1/18 is 5/90.\n\nSo sum is 1 + 20 +5 =26 \u2192 26/90 =13/45.\n\nSo the probability is 13/45.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 13/45.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. Did I consider all cases correctly? Because the problem asks for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, but not via Roger. So cases where only Alan is correct (1), only Peter is correct (2), both Alan and Peter are correct (3) \u2192 sum to 26/90=13/45.\n\nBut wait, another approach: the probability that the correct answer was achieved via non-cheating (i.e., by Alan or Peter) is the sum of the probabilities that Alan is correct OR Peter is correct, minus the overlap where both are correct.\n\nSo P(A \u2228 P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A and P).\n\nSince A and P are independent.\n\nP(A) = 1/5.\n\nP(P) =5/6.\n\nP(A and P) = (1/5)(5/6) = 1/6.\n\nSo P(A \u2228 P) = 1/5 +5/6 - 1/6 = (6/30 +25/30 -5/30) )= (6+25-5)/30 =26/30 =13/15.\n\nWait, that's 13/15. But that's the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of Roger. But wait, this is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, but it doesn't account for whether the question is answered correctly or not.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So that's the probability that (A or P is correct) and (the question is correct). But if the question is correct, it's because at least one of A, R, or P is correct. So perhaps the way to think about it is the probability that the question is correct and that it's not via cheating. So the correct answer came from Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer was achieved by either Alan or Peter, irrespective of whether the others are correct. So the events where the correct answer was via Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's correctness.\n\nWait, but in that case, the probability would be P(A or P), which is 13/15, but that can't be because it's higher than 1.\n\nWait, no, because P(A or P) is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of the others. So the correct answer could be achieved via either of them. But the question is whether the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating. So perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, regardless of whether the others are correct. But this would be P(A) + P(P) - P(A and P) = 1/5 +5/6 - (1/5)(5/6) = (6/30 +25/30) - (5/30) )= (31/30 -5/30)= 26/30=13/15. But that's the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct. But the problem is that the question is answered correctly, which could also include cases where Roger is correct. So perhaps the correct approach is to find the probability that the correct answer was achieved via Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not. But in that case, the probability is 13/15, which is 26/30, but looking at the options, I don't see that.\n\nWait, the options given are:\n\nA)1/18\n\nB)1/9\n\nC)23/90\n\nD)5/18\n\nE)13/45\n\nHmm, 13/45 is option E, which is what I got earlier when considering the cases where only Alan, only Peter, or both are correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, but wait. Another approach: the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating is the same as the probability that either Alan is correct or Peter is correct, but not Roger. So the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, but not via Roger. So, the formula would be P(A \u2228 P) minus P(R). Wait, no, that's not correct because if R is correct, it's via cheating. But if the correct answer is achieved via R, then it's via cheating, so we don't want those cases. So the probability we want is the probability that the correct answer is achieved via A or P, regardless of R's correctness.\n\nBut perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer was achieved by either Alan or Peter, and that Roger is not the one who got it correct. Or wait, no. Because the correct answer could be achieved by multiple people.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, without considering whether Roger's answer is correct. Because if the correct answer was achieved via Roger, that's via cheating, so we don't want that case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer was achieved by either Alan or Peter, irrespective of whether Roger is correct. So, the correct way is to compute P(A or P), which is 13/15, but that's not one of the options. Wait, no, because the options don't include 13/15.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering the events. Let me think again.\n\nThe question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but the method used wasn't cheating. So that would include all cases where the correct answer came from Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger also got it right.\n\nSo the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct. So it's the probability that either Alan is correct, or Peter is correct, or both.\n\nSo P(A \u2228 P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A and P).\n\nWhich is 1/5 +5/6 - (1/5)(5/6) = (6 + 25 -5)/30 = 26/30 =13/15. But that's 13/15, which is approximately 0.8667, but the options don't have that.\n\nWait, but looking back, I think I'm misunderstanding the problem. The question is whether the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating. So if the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, that's acceptable. But if the correct answer is achieved via Roger, it's not acceptable.\n\nBut the problem is that the correct answer could be achieved by multiple people. So the question is, when the correct answer is achieved, what is the probability that it was via Alan or Peter, not via Roger.\n\nSo the probability we're looking for is the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger got it right. So that would be P(A or P) = 13/15. But that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not both. Or perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved by exactly Alan or exactly Peter, not both.\n\nWait, but that's not what the question says. It just says the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So that would include any case where the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether both are correct.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger. So that would be P(A \u2228 P) =13/15. But that's not an option. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not via Roger. So the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and that Roger is incorrect. Because if Roger is incorrect, then the correct answer must have come from Alan or Peter.\n\nSo the probability that the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating is the probability that (A \u2228 P) is correct, and R is incorrect.\n\nSo the formula would be P(A \u2228 P and not R).\n\nWhich is equal to P(A \u2228 P) * P(not R) ?\n\nNo, because A, P, and R are independent, but the events are not necessarily independent when considering A \u2228 P.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and that Roger is not correct. So that would be the sum of the probabilities where either Alan is correct and Peter is incorrect, plus the probability where Peter is correct and Alan is incorrect, plus the probability where both are correct, all with Roger incorrect.\n\nSo let's compute each scenario:\n\nCase 1: Alan correct, Peter incorrect, Roger incorrect.\n\nProbability = (1/5) * (1/6) * (1/3) = 1/(5*6*3) =1/90.\n\nCase 2: Peter correct, Alan incorrect, Roger incorrect.\n\n(4/5) * (5/6) * (1/3) = (4 *5)/(5*6*3) )= (20)/(90) =2/9.\n\nCase 3: Both Alan and Peter correct, Roger incorrect.\n\n(1/5) * (5/6) * (1/3) = (5)/(5*6*3) )= 5/(90) =1/18.\n\nSo the total probability is 1/90 + 2/9 +1/18.\n\nConvert to 90 denominator:\n\n1/90 =1.\n\n2/9 =20/90.\n\n1/18=5/90.\n\nTotal: 1 +20 +5 =26 \u2192 26/90 =13/45.\n\nSo the probability is 13/45, which is option E.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, we analyze the contributions of Alan and Peter, as Roger's method involves cheating.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details.\n\nSo there are three friends: Alan, Roger, and Peter. They're all answering a question on an exam, but each has a different way of getting the answer and a different probability of being correct.\n\nAlan is just randomly guessing. His chance of being right is 1/5. That makes sense since if there are five options, he's got a 20% chance.\n\nRoger is cheating by looking at the paper in front of him. So he's got a 2/3 chance of getting it right. Hmm, higher than Alan, which I guess makes sense because he's not just guessing.\n\nPeter is the one who actually does the calculations and marks the answer, so he's pretty reliable. His probability is 5/6. That's like 83.33%, which is quite high.\n\nThe question is asking: What's the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating? Oh right, so we're looking for the cases where someone got it right, but it wasn't because Roger cheated. So that would be Alan or Peter getting it right.\n\nWait, but how are the events connected here? Are the three friends answering the same question independently? I think so, because otherwise the problem would state some dependency. So each of them has their own probability of being correct, and their successes are independent events.\n\nSo, the total probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, would be the sum of the probabilities that either Alan got it right or Peter got it right, minus any overlap where both happened. Wait, no, because the events are independent. So the correct way is to find the probability that either Alan is correct or Peter is correct, but not Roger. Or wait, no, because the question is about the correct answer being achieved without cheating. So that would be the correct answer coming from either Alan or Peter, but not from Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the question is about the question being answered correctly but not via cheating. So that would include the cases where either Alan or Peter got it right, regardless of what Roger did. But wait, no, because if Roger cheated and got it right, that's a case of cheating contributing to the correct answer. So the event we want is that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter. Because if Roger got it right, that's via cheating, so we don't count that case.\n\nWait, but wait, the way the question is phrased is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?\" So I think it's the probability that the answer is correct, and that the correct answer came from either Alan or Peter, not Roger. So we need to find the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, but not considering Roger's contribution.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the way to think about it is that the question is answered correctly, but the method wasn't cheating. So the correct answer could have come from Alan, Peter, or Roger, but we only want the cases where it's Alan or Peter. But wait, no, because Roger's method is cheating. So the correct answer could be via Alan, Peter, or Roger. But we're looking for the probability that the correct answer was via Alan or Peter, i.e., not via cheating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the question is answered correctly by someone, but that someone is not Roger. Wait, but the question is whether the correct answer was achieved without cheating. So if Roger cheated and got it right, that's via cheating. So we want the correct answer to have come from either Alan or Peter. So the probability would be the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, but Roger is not. Or wait, no. Because if the question is answered correctly, it could be that any one of them got it right. But if Roger is the one who got it right via cheating, then that's via cheating. So the total correct answers could be from any of the three, but we want only those where it's from Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but the problem is phrased as \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer was achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger did. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer was achieved by someone, but the method used wasn't cheating. So the correct answer could be achieved by Alan or Peter, but not Roger. So the events would be the cases where Alan is correct OR Peter is correct, but not Roger. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right way to model it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by someone, and we want the probability that it's achieved by Alan or Peter, i.e., not via cheating.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's model all possibilities.\n\nEach of the three can be correct or not. The events are independent because each person's success is independent of the others.\n\nWe want the probability that the question is answered correctly (i.e., at least one of them is correct) but the method wasn't cheating. Wait, no, perhaps not. Wait, the problem is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but the correct answer was not via cheating. So if the correct answer came from either Alan or Peter, that's acceptable. If it came from Roger via cheating, that's not acceptable.\n\nWait, but perhaps the correct answer is achieved by someone, regardless of who. But the way the question is phrased is a bit unclear. Let me rephrase the question: what is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but the correct answer wasn't obtained through cheating. So, the correct answer could have come from Alan or Peter. So we need to find the probability that either Alan is correct or Peter is correct, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not, but we don't want the cases where the correct answer came via Roger.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly right. Because the correct answer could be achieved by both Alan and Roger. So in that case, the correct answer was achieved via both Alan (non-cheating) and Roger (cheating). But the question is, does that count as a correct answer via cheating? Hmm, but the question is whether the correct answer was obtained via cheating. So if the correct answer came via Roger, that's via cheating. But if it came via Alan, that's not. But the problem is, the question is answered correctly, but the method used wasn't cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan OR Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct. Because if the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, then it's correct and not via cheating. But if Roger is the one who got it right, then it's via cheating.\n\nBut wait, that's not entirely accurate. Because the correct answer could be achieved by both Alan and Peter, but not Roger. So the probability that the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter is the probability that either Alan is correct, Peter is correct, or both.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The way the problem is phrased is: the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer was achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's correctness. So the correct way is to calculate the probability that either Alan is correct OR Peter is correct, minus the cases where both are correct but also Roger is correct. Wait, no, because that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer was achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's actions.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to model this with probabilities.\n\nEach person has their own probability of being correct:\n\n- Alan: 1/5\n- Roger: 2/3\n- Peter: 5/6\n\nThe events are independent, so the probabilities multiply when considering combinations.\n\nWe want the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating. So that would be the probability that the correct answer was achieved by Alan or Peter. But wait, what if both Alan and Peter got it right? Then the correct answer was achieved by both, but since the question is just about whether it's correct and not via cheating, that would count as a success.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way to model it is that the question is considered correctly answered if at least one of the three got it right. But among those cases, we want the ones where the correct answer was not via cheating. So the correct answer was via Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, that's a different approach. So the total probability that the question is answered correctly is the probability that at least one of Alan, Roger, or Peter got it right. But we want the probability that, given the question is correct, it was not via cheating. So perhaps it's conditional probability.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So that's the same as the probability that the question is correctly answered by Alan or Peter, without considering Roger's method. Or perhaps, more accurately, the correct answer was achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger's answer was correct.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about it in terms of events.\n\nLet A be the event that Alan is correct.\n\nLet R be the event that Roger is correct.\n\nLet P be the event that Peter is correct.\n\nWe want the probability that the question is answered correctly (i.e., A \u2228 R \u2228 P is true) but not via cheating. So via cheating would be R being true. So the correct answer is achieved without cheating if it's achieved by A or P, regardless of R.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly correct because if R is true, then the correct answer was via cheating. But if the question is answered correctly, it could be that multiple people got it right. So the question is, when the question is answered correctly, what is the probability that it's because of Alan or Peter, not because of Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a conditional probability. So the probability that the correct answer was via non-cheating (A or P) given that the question is answered correctly.\n\nSo that would be P(A \u2228 P) / P(A \u2228 R \u2228 P).\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So perhaps that's the same as the probability that (A \u2228 P) is true, without considering R. No, because the question is answered correctly, so that's (A \u2228 R \u2228 P). But we want the probability that the correct answer wasn't via cheating, which would be (A \u2228 P) minus any overlap where R is also correct. Or perhaps more accurately, it's the probability that (A \u2228 P) is true and R is not necessarily considered.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach.\n\nThe question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but the method wasn't cheating. So the correct answer was achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger also got it right.\n\nWait, no. Because if the correct answer was achieved via both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating, so we wouldn't want that case. So the correct way is to find the probability that the correct answer was achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. Because if Roger's answer is correct, then the method was cheating.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me think in terms of cases.\n\nThe correct answer could be achieved in several ways:\n\n1. Only Alan is correct.\n\n2. Only Peter is correct.\n\n3. Both Alan and Peter are correct.\n\n4. Alan and Roger are correct.\n\n5. Peter and Roger are correct.\n\n6. All three are correct.\n\n7. Only Roger is correct.\n\n8. None are correct.\n\nWe want the cases where the correct answer is achieved without cheating, which would be cases 1, 2, 3. Because in those cases, the correct answer came from Alan and/or Peter, not via Roger's cheating. So the probability we're looking for is the sum of the probabilities of cases 1, 2, and 3.\n\nSo, let's compute each of these cases.\n\nCase 1: Only Alan is correct. That means Alan is correct (1/5), Roger is incorrect (1 - 2/3 = 1/3), and Peter is incorrect (1 - 5/6 = 1/6).\n\nProbability = (1/5) * (1/3) * (1/6) = (1) / (5*3*6) = 1/90.\n\nCase 2: Only Peter is correct. Alan is incorrect (4/5), Roger incorrect (1/3), Peter correct (5/6).\n\nProbability = (4/5) * (1/3) * (5/6) = (4 * 1 *5) / (5 *3 *6) ) = (20)/(90) = 2/9.\n\nWait, let me compute that again. (4/5) * (1/3) = 4/(15). Then 4/(15) * 5/6 = (4*5)/(15*6) = 20/90 = 2/9. Correct.\n\nCase 3: Both Alan and Peter are correct. So Alan correct (1/5), Roger incorrect (1/3), Peter correct (5/6).\n\nProbability = (1/5) * (1/3) * (5/6) = (1 * 1 *5) / (5 *3 *6) ) = 5/(90) = 1/18.\n\nSo the total probability for cases 1, 2, 3 is 1/90 + 2/9 + 1/18.\n\nLet me convert all to 90 denominator.\n\n1/90 is 1/90.\n\n2/9 is 20/90.\n\n1/18 is 5/90.\n\nSo sum is 1 + 20 +5 =26, so 26/90. Simplify that, 13/45.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nCase 1: 1/5 * 1/3 * 1/6 = 1/(5*3*6) = 1/90.\n\nCase 2: (4/5) * (1/3) * (5/6) \u2192 Let's compute this.\n\n(4/5) * (1/3) = 4/(15). Multiply by 5/6: 4/(15) *5/6 = (4*5)/(15*6) )= 20/90 = 2/9.\n\nCase 3: (1/5) * (1/3) * (5/6) = (1*1*5)/(5*3*6) )=5/(90)=1/18.\n\nSo sum is 1/90 + 2/9 + 1/18.\n\nConvert all to 90ths.\n\n1/90 is 1.\n\n2/9 is 20/90.\n\n1/18 is 5/90.\n\nSo sum is 1 + 20 +5 =26 \u2192 26/90 =13/45.\n\nSo the probability is 13/45.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 13/45.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. Did I consider all cases correctly? Because the problem asks for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, but not via Roger. So cases where only Alan is correct (1), only Peter is correct (2), both Alan and Peter are correct (3) \u2192 sum to 26/90=13/45.\n\nBut wait, another approach: the probability that the correct answer was achieved via non-cheating (i.e., by Alan or Peter) is the sum of the probabilities that Alan is correct OR Peter is correct, minus the overlap where both are correct.\n\nSo P(A \u2228 P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A and P).\n\nSince A and P are independent.\n\nP(A) = 1/5.\n\nP(P) =5/6.\n\nP(A and P) = (1/5)(5/6) = 1/6.\n\nSo P(A \u2228 P) = 1/5 +5/6 - 1/6 = (6/30 +25/30 -5/30) )= (6+25-5)/30 =26/30 =13/15.\n\nWait, that's 13/15. But that's the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of Roger. But wait, this is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, but it doesn't account for whether the question is answered correctly or not.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So that's the probability that (A or P is correct) and (the question is correct). But if the question is correct, it's because at least one of A, R, or P is correct. So perhaps the way to think about it is the probability that the question is correct and that it's not via cheating. So the correct answer came from Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer was achieved by either Alan or Peter, irrespective of whether the others are correct. So the events where the correct answer was via Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's correctness.\n\nWait, but in that case, the probability would be P(A or P), which is 13/15, but that can't be because it's higher than 1.\n\nWait, no, because P(A or P) is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of the others. So the correct answer could be achieved via either of them. But the question is whether the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating. So perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, regardless of whether the others are correct. But this would be P(A) + P(P) - P(A and P) = 1/5 +5/6 - (1/5)(5/6) = (6/30 +25/30) - (5/30) )= (31/30 -5/30)= 26/30=13/15. But that's the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct. But the problem is that the question is answered correctly, which could also include cases where Roger is correct. So perhaps the correct approach is to find the probability that the correct answer was achieved via Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not. But in that case, the probability is 13/15, which is 26/30, but looking at the options, I don't see that.\n\nWait, the options given are:\n\nA)1/18\n\nB)1/9\n\nC)23/90\n\nD)5/18\n\nE)13/45\n\nHmm, 13/45 is option E, which is what I got earlier when considering the cases where only Alan, only Peter, or both are correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, but wait. Another approach: the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating is the same as the probability that either Alan is correct or Peter is correct, but not Roger. So the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, but not via Roger. So, the formula would be P(A \u2228 P) minus P(R). Wait, no, that's not correct because if R is correct, it's via cheating. But if the correct answer is achieved via R, then it's via cheating, so we don't want those cases. So the probability we want is the probability that the correct answer is achieved via A or P, regardless of R's correctness.\n\nBut perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer was achieved by either Alan or Peter, and that Roger is not the one who got it correct. Or wait, no. Because the correct answer could be achieved by multiple people.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, without considering whether Roger's answer is correct. Because if the correct answer was achieved via Roger, that's via cheating, so we don't want that case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer was achieved by either Alan or Peter, irrespective of whether Roger is correct. So, the correct way is to compute P(A or P), which is 13/15, but that's not one of the options. Wait, no, because the options don't include 13/15.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering the events. Let me think again.\n\nThe question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but the method used wasn't cheating. So that would include all cases where the correct answer came from Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger also got it right.\n\nSo the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct. So it's the probability that either Alan is correct, or Peter is correct, or both.\n\nSo P(A \u2228 P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A and P).\n\nWhich is 1/5 +5/6 - (1/5)(5/6) = (6 + 25 -5)/30 = 26/30 =13/15. But that's 13/15, which is approximately 0.8667, but the options don't have that.\n\nWait, but looking back, I think I'm misunderstanding the problem. The question is whether the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating. So if the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, that's acceptable. But if the correct answer is achieved via Roger, it's not acceptable.\n\nBut the problem is that the correct answer could be achieved by multiple people. So the question is, when the correct answer is achieved, what is the probability that it was via Alan or Peter, not via Roger.\n\nSo the probability we're looking for is the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger got it right. So that would be P(A or P) = 13/15. But that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not both. Or perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved by exactly Alan or exactly Peter, not both.\n\nWait, but that's not what the question says. It just says the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So that would include any case where the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether both are correct.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger. So that would be P(A \u2228 P) =13/15. But that's not an option. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not via Roger. So the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and that Roger is incorrect. Because if Roger is incorrect, then the correct answer must have come from Alan or Peter.\n\nSo the probability that the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating is the probability that (A \u2228 P) is correct, and R is incorrect.\n\nSo the formula would be P(A \u2228 P and not R).\n\nWhich is equal to P(A \u2228 P) * P(not R) ?\n\nNo, because A, P, and R are independent, but the events are not necessarily independent when considering A \u2228 P.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and that Roger is not correct. So that would be the sum of the probabilities where either Alan is correct and Peter is incorrect, plus the probability where Peter is correct and Alan is incorrect, plus the probability where both are correct, all with Roger incorrect.\n\nSo let's compute each scenario:\n\nCase 1: Alan correct, Peter incorrect, Roger incorrect.\n\nProbability = (1/5) * (1/6) * (1/3) = 1/(5*6*3) =1/90.\n\nCase 2: Peter correct, Alan incorrect, Roger incorrect.\n\n(4/5) * (5/6) * (1/3) = (4 *5)/(5*6*3) )= (20)/(90) =2/9.\n\nCase 3: Both Alan and Peter correct, Roger incorrect.\n\n(1/5) * (5/6) * (1/3) = (5)/(5*6*3) )= 5/(90) =1/18.\n\nSo the total probability is 1/90 + 2/9 +1/18.\n\nConvert to 90 denominator:\n\n1/90 =1.\n\n2/9 =20/90.\n\n1/18=5/90.\n\nTotal: 1 +20 +5 =26 \u2192 26/90 =13/45.\n\nSo the probability is 13/45, which is option E.\n\n\nTo determine the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, we analyze the contributions of Alan and Peter, as Roger's method involves cheating. The probabilities of each person answering correctly are given as follows:\n\n- **Alan**: \\( P(A) = \\frac{1}{5} \\)\n- **Roger**: \\( P(R) = \\frac{2}{3} \\) (via cheating, so excluded from our desired calculation)\n- **Peter**: \\( P(P) = \\frac{5}{6} \\)\n\nThe events are independent, so we can calculate the probabilities of combinations of correct answers by multiplying individual probabilities.\n\n### Desired Cases:\nWe want the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, but not via cheating. This includes three scenarios:\n1. **Only Alan is correct**: Alan is correct, Peter is incorrect, and Roger is incorrect.\n2. **Only Peter is correct**: Alan is incorrect, Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n3. **Both Alan and Peter are correct**: Alan is correct, Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\n### Calculations:\n1. **Only Alan is correct**:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{Only Alan}) = P(A) \\cdot P(\\neg P) \\cdot P(\\neg R) = \\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{90}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Only Peter is correct**:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{Only Peter}) = P(\\neg A) \\cdot P(P) \\cdot P(\\neg R) = \\frac{4}{5} \\cdot \\frac{5}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{20}{90} = \\frac{2}{9}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Both Alan and Peter are correct**:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{Both Alan and Peter}) = P(A) \\cdot P(P) \\cdot P(\\neg R) = \\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{5}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{5}{90} = \\frac{1}{18}.\n   \\]\n\n### Total Probability:\nThe total probability is the sum of the probabilities of the three cases:\n\\[\nP(\\text{Correct, not via cheating}) = \\frac{1}{90} + \\frac{2}{9} + \\frac{1}{18}.\n\\]\n\nConverting all terms to a common denominator of 90:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{90} + \\frac{20}{90} + \\frac{5}{90} = \\frac{26}{90}.\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\\[\n\\frac{26}{90} = \\frac{13}{45}.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is:\n\n**Answer: E**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this probability question. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThere are three friends: Alan, Roger, and Peter. Each of them is answering a question on an exam, but they have different probabilities of getting it right. The question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. Hmm, so we need the correct answer, but it shouldn't involve Roger cheating. So, the correct answer must come from either Alan or Peter, but not Roger.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait a second. The wording says, \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, does that mean that the question is correct, but the method wasn't cheating? So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, not by Roger's cheating. Because if Roger cheats and gets it right, that's a correct answer but via cheating. So we need to exclude that scenario.\n\nWait, but how are the three of them answering the question? Are they all answering the same question independently, or is it that only one of them is answering and others aren't? Hmm, the question says \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So perhaps it's the case that the question is answered correctly by someone, but that someone is not via cheating. So, we need the probability that either Alan or Peter got it right, but not Roger.\n\nWait, but maybe the question is that all three attempt the question, and we're to find the probability that at least one of them got it right, but the correct answer didn't come from Roger via cheating. Or perhaps, the question is about whether the answer is correct, but not because of cheating. So, the correct answer must be due to either Alan or Peter. But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem states: \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, the question is correctly answered, but the method wasn't cheating. So, correct answer via Alan (non-cheating) or via Peter (non-cheating), but not via Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, but how is the question answered? Are all three answering, and the question is correct if at least one of them got it right? Or is the question being answered correctly by someone, but the correct answer isn't via cheating. Alternatively, perhaps the question is whether the correct answer comes from someone who isn't cheating, so either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, perhaps the scenario is that each of them answers the question, and the question is considered correctly answered if any one of them got it right. But we want to exclude cases where the correct answer was via cheating. So, we want the cases where the question is correct, but it was Alan or Peter who got it right. So, perhaps the correct answer is that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but perhaps the way to approach it is: the question is answered correctly if at least one of the three got it right. But we want the cases where it's correct, but Roger didn't cheat to get it. So, perhaps we need to calculate the probability that the question is correct, minus the probability that Roger cheated and got it correct.\n\nWait, no, that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved via either Alan or Peter, not via Roger. So, the probability that either Alan is correct or Peter is correct, but not Roger. Hmm, but wait, maybe not. Because if all three are answering independently, the question being correct might require that at least one is correct, but without involving Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the probability that the answer is correct, but the correct answer came from someone who didn't cheat. So, the correct answer must have come from either Alan or Peter. But the way the question is phrased is a bit unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the question is answered correctly, but the method used wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer could come from either Alan or Peter, but not from Roger's cheating. So, the probability we're looking for is the probability that the correct answer is either Alan's or Peter's, but not Roger's.\n\nWait, but perhaps the question is whether the answer is correct, and it's not via cheating. So, the correct answer is from either Alan or Peter. So, the scenario is that the answer is correct, but the method wasn't cheating. So, we need to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but how do the three friends' answers contribute to the question being answered correctly? Are they each answering the same question, and the question is considered correct if any one of them answers correctly? Or is the question answered correctly if all three agree on the answer? Or perhaps, the question is answered correctly if at least one of them is correct. But the problem isn't entirely clear. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, perhaps the question is answered correctly, and the correct answer wasn't obtained via cheating, which would be Roger's method. So, the correct answer must come from either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is whether the answer is correct, and the correct answer is via either Alan or Peter, not via Roger. So, the correct answer is either Alan's correct guess or Peter's correct calculation. So, the probability that the correct answer is from either Alan or Peter.\n\nBut wait, how does this work? Because all three are answering the same question. So, each has their own probability of being correct, and the question is correct if at least one of them is correct. But we want the probability that the question is correct, and the correct answer is not via cheating. So, the question is correct, and it's because Alan or Peter got it right, not Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to compute this is:\n\nP(Question Correct and Not via Cheating) = P(Question Correct) - P(Question Correct via Cheating).\n\nBecause P(Question Correct) is the probability that at least one of Alan, Roger, or Peter got it right. P(Question Correct via Cheating) is the probability that Roger got it right, and the others didn't. Because if Roger got it right, and the question is correct, but via cheating, we need to exclude that scenario.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is answered correctly, but it wasn't Roger who answered it. So, the correct answer is from Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the probability that the question is correct is equal to 1 minus the probability that all three got it wrong. But then, from that, we subtract the probability that only Roger got it right, because that's via cheating.\n\nWait, let's approach it step by step.\n\nFirst, find the probability that the question is answered correctly by anyone (Alan, Roger, or Peter). Then, subtract the probability that the correct answer came from Roger (cheating). Because the question wants the correct answer but not via cheating.\n\nSo, first, compute P(Question Correct) = 1 - P(all three wrong).\n\nCompute P(Alan wrong) = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5.\n\nP(Roger wrong) = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nP(Peter wrong) = 1 - 5/6 = 1/6.\n\nSo, P(all three wrong) = (4/5) * (1/3) * (1/6) = (4)/(5*3*6) = 4/90 = 2/45.\n\nThus, P(Question Correct) = 1 - 2/45 = 43/45.\n\nNow, compute P(Question Correct via Cheating). That would be the probability that only Roger got it right, and Alan and Peter got it wrong.\n\nSo, P(Roger correct) * P(Alan wrong) * P(Peter wrong) = (2/3) * (4/5) * (1/6).\n\nCalculating that: (2/3) * (4/5) * (1/6) = (8)/(90) = 4/45.\n\nWait, but that's the probability that only Roger is correct. Because if Roger is correct and the others are wrong, that's the scenario where the correct answer is via cheating.\n\nSo, the probability that the question is correct via cheating is 4/45.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the question is correct but not via cheating is P(Question Correct) - P(Question Correct via Cheating).\n\nSo, 43/45 - 4/45 = 39/45 = 13/15. Wait, that can't be right, because 43-4=39, and 39/45 simplifies to 13/15, which is approximately 0.8667, but looking at the options, the highest option is E)13/45 (approx 0.2889). So that can't be right. So, I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Maybe the question is about whether the answer is correct, but the correct answer was not obtained via cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is from either Alan or Peter, but not from Roger.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to think is: the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter. So, the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger didn't. Because if Roger answered correctly, that's via cheating, which we want to exclude.\n\nWait, but that approach would be to compute P(Alan correct OR Peter correct) AND Roger incorrect.\n\nSo, P(Alan correct OR Peter correct) = P(Alan correct) + P(Peter correct) - P(Alan correct AND Peter correct).\n\nSo, P(Alan correct) = 1/5, P(Peter correct)=5/6.\n\nP(Alan correct and Peter correct) = (1/5)*(5/6) = 1/6.\n\nSo, P(Alan OR Peter correct) = 1/5 +5/6 -1/6 = 1/5 +4/6 = (6/30 +20/30) = 26/30 =13/15.\n\nBut we also need Roger to be incorrect because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer is via cheating. So, the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo, P(Alan correct OR Peter correct) AND Roger incorrect.\n\nWhich is P(Alan OR Peter correct) multiplied by P(Roger incorrect), assuming independence.\n\nWait, but no, because the events are independent, so P(A OR P correct) and R incorrect is equal to [P(A correct) + P(P correct) - P(A and P correct)] * P(R incorrect).\n\nSo, P(Roger incorrect) is 1/3.\n\nSo, the probability is (1/5 + 5/6 - (1/5)(5/6)) ) * (1/3).\n\nCompute the terms:\n\n1/5 is 0.2, 5/6 is ~0.8333. Their product is (1/5)(5/6)=1/6 \u22480.1667.\n\nSo, 1/5 +5/6 = (6 +25)/30 =31/30? Wait no, that can't be. Wait, 1/5 is 6/30, 5/6 is 25/30. So, 6/30 +25/30 =31/30. Then subtract 1/6, which is 5/30. So 31/30 -5/30 =26/30 =13/15.\n\nSo, the term in the brackets is 13/15.\n\nMultiply by 1/3: (13/15) * (1/3) =13/45.\n\nSo, 13/45 is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect. So, that would be the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 13/45. So, the correct answer would be E.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because earlier I thought of the approach where P(Question Correct) is 43/45, but that approach included all correct answers. So, when we subtract the cases where only Roger is correct, we get 43/45 -4/45=39/45=13/15, which is much higher than any of the options. So, perhaps that approach was wrong.\n\nBut the other approach, where we calculate the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect, gives 13/45, which is option E.\n\nSo, perhaps that's the correct answer.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this probability question. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThere are three friends: Alan, Roger, and Peter. Each of them is answering a question on an exam, but they have different probabilities of getting it right. The question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. Hmm, so we need the correct answer, but it shouldn't involve Roger cheating. So, the correct answer must come from either Alan or Peter, but not Roger.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait a second. The wording says, \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, does that mean that the question is correct, but the method wasn't cheating? So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, not by Roger's cheating. Because if Roger cheats and gets it right, that's a correct answer but via cheating. So we need to exclude that scenario.\n\nWait, but how are the three of them answering the question? Are they all answering the same question independently, or is it that only one of them is answering and others aren't? Hmm, the question says \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So perhaps it's the case that the question is answered correctly by someone, but that someone is not via cheating. So, we need the probability that either Alan or Peter got it right, but not Roger.\n\nWait, but maybe the question is that all three attempt the question, and we're to find the probability that at least one of them got it right, but the correct answer didn't come from Roger via cheating. Or perhaps, the question is about whether the answer is correct, but not because of cheating. So, the correct answer must be due to either Alan or Peter. But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem states: \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, the question is correctly answered, but the method wasn't cheating. So, correct answer via Alan (non-cheating) or via Peter (non-cheating), but not via Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, but how is the question answered? Are all three answering, and the question is correct if at least one of them got it right? Or is the question being answered correctly by someone, but the correct answer isn't via cheating. Alternatively, perhaps the question is whether the correct answer comes from someone who isn't cheating, so either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, perhaps the scenario is that each of them answers the question, and the question is considered correctly answered if any one of them got it right. But we want to exclude cases where the correct answer was via cheating. So, we want the cases where the question is correct, but it was Alan or Peter who got it right. So, perhaps the correct answer is that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but perhaps the way to approach it is: the question is answered correctly if at least one of the three got it right. But we want the cases where it's correct, but Roger didn't cheat to get it. So, perhaps we need to calculate the probability that the question is correct, minus the probability that Roger cheated and got it correct.\n\nWait, no, that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved via either Alan or Peter, not via Roger. So, the probability that either Alan is correct or Peter is correct, but not Roger. Hmm, but wait, maybe not. Because if all three are answering independently, the question being correct might require that at least one is correct, but without involving Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the probability that the answer is correct, but the correct answer came from someone who didn't cheat. So, the correct answer must have come from either Alan or Peter. But the way the question is phrased is a bit unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the question is answered correctly, but the method used wasn't cheating.

So, the correct answer is from either Alan or Peter. So, the scenario is that the answer is correct, but the method wasn't cheating. So, we need to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but how do the three friends' answers contribute to the question being answered correctly? Are they each answering the same question, and the question is considered correct if any one of them answers correctly? Or is the question answered correctly if all three agree on the answer? Or perhaps, the question is answered correctly if at least one of them is correct. But the problem isn't entirely clear. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, perhaps the question is answered correctly, and the correct answer wasn't obtained via cheating, which would be Roger's method.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.\n\nSo, there are three friends: Alan, Roger, and Peter. Each of them is trying to answer a question on an exam. They each have different probabilities of getting the answer right. The question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. Hmm, right, so we're looking for the case where the answer is correct, but it's not because of Roger's cheating.\n\nLet me break down each person's probability:\n\n- Alan is guessing randomly, so his probability of being correct is 1/5.\n- Roger is cheating, so his probability is 2/3.\n- Peter is doing the work, so his probability is 5/6.\n\nWait, but how are they answering the question? Are they each answering independently? I think so, because the problem doesn't specify any other scenario. So each of them has their own probability of being right, and their attempts are independent events.\n\nThe question asks for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, I think that means that either Alan or Peter got it right, but not Roger. Or wait, no\u2014wait, maybe the question is about whether someone got it right without cheating. Oh, wait, no. The question is about the answer being correct but not via cheating. So, it's correct because either Alan or Peter got it right. Because if Roger got it right, that's via cheating. So we want the cases where either Alan or Peter is correct, but not Roger. Or maybe the other way around: the answer is correct, but it wasn't Roger who did it. So, the correct answer is achieved either by Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but maybe the way the problem is phrased, the question is whether someone (any of the three) got it right, but not through cheating. So, that would be either Alan or Peter getting it right, but not Roger. But wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the question is correctly answered, but the method wasn't cheating, which would mean that either Alan or Peter was correct. But I need to think about the setup.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So the correct answer is achieved without cheating. So, either Alan or Peter got it right, but not Roger. Or, maybe the question is answered correctly, and the answer came from someone who didn't cheat. Hmm. So, the correct answer is achieved via either Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger did. But wait, do all three answer the question, and the question is considered answered correctly if at least one of them got it right? Or is each of them answering separately, and the question is whether any of them got it correct without cheating?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to model the scenario more clearly. Let's assume that each of the three friends is answering the question independently. So, Alan has a 1/5 chance, Roger 2/3, and Peter 5/6.\n\nThe question is, what is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given, but not by Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer could be from Alan or Peter, but not from Roger. But wait, wait a second\u2014could it be that the question is about whether the correct answer is achieved without cheating, meaning that the correct answer is from Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger answered correctly or not?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is whether the correct answer was achieved without cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, but not via Roger. So, the probability is that either Alan or Peter got it right, but not both? Or is it that at least one of them got it right, regardless of Roger's answer.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the events.\n\nLet me think: The question being answered correctly can happen in several ways. Let's consider all possible correct answers.\n\nCase 1: Only Alan is correct. So, Alan correct, Roger incorrect, Peter incorrect.\n\nCase 2: Only Roger is correct. Alan incorrect, Roger correct, Peter incorrect.\n\nCase 3: Only Peter is correct. Alan incorrect, Roger incorrect, Peter correct.\n\nCase 4: Alan and Roger correct, Peter incorrect.\n\nCase 5: Alan and Peter correct, Roger incorrect.\n\nCase 6: Roger and Peter correct, Alan incorrect.\n\nCase 7: All three correct.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, in other words, the correct answer is achieved by someone who didn't cheat. That would mean that the correct answer came from either Alan or Peter, but not Roger.\n\nWait, no. Because if someone who didn't cheat got it right, then the question is considered correctly answered without cheating. So, the question is answered correctly regardless of how it was done, but the method (cheating or not) is a factor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but the method wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer could be achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way to model this is to find the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, minus the cases where all three are correct (but I'm not sure). Hmm, no, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the event where the answer is correct, but the correct answer was not achieved via cheating. So, it's the probability that the correct answer came from either Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger did.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is phrased is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read the question.\n\nThe question is: \"What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?\"\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer is obtained via either Alan or Peter, not via Roger. So, the probability is that either Alan is correct, or Peter is correct, but Roger isn't necessarily correct. Or is it that the correct answer is obtained without Roger's cheating, regardless of whether someone else got it right.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to think about it is: the question is answered correctly, and the method (cheating or not) is not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter. So, the probability we're looking for is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, but not Roger. Or wait, no\u2014because the question is about whether the correct answer is achieved without cheating, which would include any scenario where Alan or Peter got it right, regardless of what Roger did. Because if Roger is correct, that's cheating, but if Alan or Peter are correct, that's non-cheating.\n\nWait, but the way the question is phrased, \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating\" suggests that the correct answer was achieved through non-cheating means. So, that would be the probability that the correct answer was from Alan or Peter, regardless of whether the other got it right or wrong.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but it's not because of Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer could be from Alan, Peter, or both, but not from Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly, which is the probability that at least one of Alan, Roger, or Peter is correct. But then subtract the probability that it's answered correctly via cheating (i.e., Roger is correct, and Alan and Peter are incorrect). Hmm, that might make sense.\n\nWait, let's think. The probability that the question is correctly answered is P(A \u2228 R \u2228 P). We need the probability that the question is correctly answered but not via cheating. So, that would be P(correct) minus P(correct via cheating).\n\nWhat's P(correct via cheating)? That's the probability that Roger is correct, and Alan and Peter are incorrect. Because if Roger is correct and Alan and Peter are incorrect, then the correct answer is via cheating.\n\nSo, the desired probability is P(A \u2228 R \u2228 P) - P(R \u2227 \u00acA \u2227 \u00acP).\n\nAlternatively, the desired probability is the probability that the correct answer was achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger got it right or not. Wait, no. Because if Roger got it right and Alan and Peter didn't, then the correct answer was via cheating. So, to get the correct answer via non-cheating, the correct answer must be achieved by Alan or Peter, but Roger could have either correct or incorrect, but the key is that the correct answer was achieved via non-cheating methods.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as: the correct answer is achieved without cheating, meaning that either Alan is correct, or Peter is correct, regardless of what Roger does. But wait, if Roger is correct, that's via cheating, so the correct answer is via cheating. So, the correct answer is not via cheating only if either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, no. Because if all three are correct, then the correct answer is via cheating (from Roger) and non-cheating (from Alan and Peter). So, the correct answer was achieved via both methods. But the question is about whether the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating. So, perhaps we need to calculate the probability that the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's correctness. But I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not by Roger. Because the question is about not via cheating, which is Roger's method.\n\nSo, the probability that the question is answered correctly without cheating is the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, regardless of whether Roger did or not. But wait, no\u2014because if the question is answered correctly by both Roger and, say, Alan, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating (Roger) and non-cheating (Alan). So, the fact that someone answered correctly via non-cheating doesn't mean that the correct answer isn't via cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the question was answered correctly, and the correct answer was given without cheating. So, that would be the case where the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger also got it right or not.\n\nWait, that doesn't make much sense. Because if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Roger, then the question was answered correctly, but it was via cheating as well as non-cheating. So, the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, would be the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. Hmm, I think I'm getting tangled here.\n\nLet me try to approach it another way. The question is answered correctly via cheating if Roger is correct, regardless of what Alan and Peter do. So, the correct answer via cheating is when Roger is correct, and the others can be either correct or not. But wait, no\u2014if the correct answer is given by Roger, but Alan or Peter also happen to be correct, that's still considered as the correct answer being via cheating because Roger's method is cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the desired probability is the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not. But that's not the same as the question's wording. The question is about the correct answer being given without cheating, which I think implies that the correct answer was given by someone who didn't cheat, which would be Alan or Peter.\n\nBut if all three are correct, then the correct answer was given via cheating (Roger) and via non-cheating (Alan and Peter). So, the question is, do we count that scenario as the correct answer being given without cheating? Because the correct answer was achieved by Alan and Peter.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question is just about whether the correct answer was given by someone who didn't cheat, regardless of whether others did. So, the correct answer could have been given by either Alan or Peter, or both, or all three, but as long as someone non-cheating (Alan or Peter) got it right.\n\nWait, but the question says, \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer is given, and the method used wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but not via Roger.\n\nWait, no, because if Roger is correct, that's via cheating, but the correct answer is still given. So, the question is about the correct answer being given, but the method wasn't cheating. So, perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger did.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way to model this is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly, but the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, not by Roger. So, in other words, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger also got it right.\n\nBut wait, if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer was given via cheating (Roger) and non-cheating (Alan). So, in that case, the correct answer was via cheating. So, the question is about the correct answer being given without cheating, so that would exclude cases where Roger is correct, regardless of whether Alan and Peter are correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think of it as the correct answer being achieved by non-cheating methods. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether the others are correct. So, the probability that either Alan is correct, or Peter is correct, or both.\n\nWait, but that would include cases where Roger is correct as well. So, that would not exclude cheating. So, perhaps that's not the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but Roger didn't contribute to it. But that's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly by someone who didn't cheat. That would be the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, regardless of what Roger did. Because if Roger answered correctly, that's via cheating, but if Alan or Peter answered correctly, that's via non-cheating. So, the probability that the correct answer is given via non-cheating is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of Roger.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because if all three are correct, then the correct answer was given via both cheating and non-cheating. But the question is about the probability that the correct answer is given without cheating. So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct because if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer was given via cheating as well as non-cheating. So, the correct answer is given via cheating, so the event we want is when the correct answer is given via non-cheating, i.e., only Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about whether the correct answer was given without cheating, so that the correct answer came from either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger's answer was correct or not. So, in this case, the probability would be P(Alan correct OR Peter correct), regardless of Roger's correctness.\n\nBut let's compute that. The probability that Alan or Peter is correct is P(A) + P(P) - P(A and P). Because they might both be correct.\n\nSo, P(A) = 1/5, P(P) =5/6. P(A and P) is (1/5)*(5/6) = (1/5)*(5/6) = 1/6. So, P(A or P) = 1/5 +5/6 - 1/6 = (6/30 +25/30) -5/30 = (31/30 -5/30) =26/30 =13/15.\n\nBut wait, if we consider that the correct answer is given via non-cheating, then this would include cases where Roger is correct as well. Because the correct answer could have been given by both Alan and Roger. So, that approach might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given via non-cheating, regardless of whether it's also given via cheating. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger.\n\nSo, the probability that the correct answer is given via non-cheating is P(A \u2228 P). Because if either Alan or Peter is correct, then the correct answer is given via non-cheating.\n\nBut wait, if both Alan and Roger are correct, then the correct answer was given via both cheating and non-cheating. So, in that case, the correct answer was given via cheating, so that scenario would not be counted in our desired probability.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let's think of it as the correct answer is given without cheating, which would mean that the correct answer came from Alan or Peter, and not from Roger. So, we need the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger.\n\nWait, no. Because the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer was given via non-cheating. So, the correct answer could have been given by Alan, Peter, both, or all three, but the key is that the correct answer was given via non-cheating, regardless of whether it was also given via cheating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether it's also given by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating, which includes any scenario where Alan or Peter is correct.\n\nBut I think I'm not correctly interpreting the question. Let me try to rephrase it. The problem asks for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, but the method used wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer was achieved by Alan or Peter. So, the probability is that either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of what Roger does.\n\nBut wait, if all three are correct, then the correct answer was achieved via both cheating and non-cheating. So, in that case, the correct answer was achieved via cheating as well, so it's not just non-cheating. So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating, which would be the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the correct answer could be given by all three. So, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probability that the correct answer is given by at least one of Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger does.\n\nWait, but if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was given via cheating. So, the correct answer being given without cheating would require that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was given via cheating, which is what we're excluding.\n\nAh, that makes sense. So, the correct answer is given without cheating only if the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo, the probability we're looking for is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, no. Because if both Alan and Peter are correct, and Roger is incorrect, then the correct answer is given via non-cheating. If Alan is correct, Roger is incorrect, Peter is incorrect, that's a case where the correct answer is given via non-cheating. Similarly, if Peter is correct, and the others are incorrect, that's another case.\n\nBut if both Alan and Peter are correct, and Roger is incorrect, that's still a case where the correct answer is given via non-cheating. So, the correct way to model this is to find the probability that either Alan is correct and Roger is incorrect, or Peter is correct and Roger is incorrect, or both Alan and Peter are correct and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, but this can be simplified. Because the correct answer is given without cheating if either Alan or Peter is correct, but not if Roger is correct. Wait, no. Because if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer was given via cheating as well as non-cheating, so in that case, the correct answer was given via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to calculate the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger.\n\nWait, no. Because if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Peter, then it's given via non-cheating, regardless of Roger. So, the correct answer is given via non-cheating if either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of whether Roger is correct.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was given via cheating, which is what we're excluding. So, the correct answer is given without cheating only if the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger.\n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let's try to model it mathematically.\n\nThe probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating is equal to the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, minus the cases where the correct answer is also given by Roger. Or, perhaps more accurately, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is given via non-cheating methods, and not via cheating.\n\nSo, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger. So, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) - P(R) * P(A \u2228 P), but that's not right.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute the probability that the correct answer is given via non-cheating, which is the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nSo, let me compute the probability that the correct answer is given via non-cheating: that is, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger.\n\nSo, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger. So, the events are:\n\nEither Alan is correct and Roger is incorrect,\n\nOR Peter is correct and Roger is incorrect,\n\nOR both Alan and Peter are correct and Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A and not R) + P(P and not R) - P(A and P and not R).\n\nWait, no, because P(A and not R) includes cases where Peter is incorrect, and P(P and not R) includes cases where Alan is incorrect. So, the correct way is to compute P(A \u2228 P) given that R is false.\n\nAlternatively, the correct way is to compute the probability that (A \u2228 P) and not R.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because if R is correct, then the correct answer was given via cheating, which we want to exclude. So, the correct approach is to compute the probability that (A \u2228 P) is true, and R is false.\n\nSo, the event is (A \u2228 P) \u2227 (\u00acR). So, the probability we need is P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ).\n\nHmm, but wait, perhaps the correct answer is given via non-cheating if either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of whether Roger is correct. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was given via cheating, which we're excluding. So, the correct answer is given via non-cheating if either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, no. Because if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer was given via cheating, which we want to exclude. So, the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger. So, that's the same as (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P and \u00acR).\n\nTo compute this, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events, but with the condition that R is false.\n\nSo, first, compute the probability that R is false. P(\u00acR) = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nThen, compute the probability that A \u2228 P is true given that R is false. Since A and P are independent of R, because each person answers independently.\n\nSo, P(A \u2228 P | \u00acR) = P(A \u2228 P) because R's correctness doesn't affect A and P's correctness.\n\nWait, no. Because if R is false, it doesn't change the probabilities of A and P. So, P(A \u2228 P | \u00acR) = P(A \u2228 P).\n\nWait, but A and P are independent of R. So, P(A \u2228 P | \u00acR) = P(A \u2228 P). Because whether R is correct or not doesn't influence A or P.\n\nSo, P(A \u2228 P) is 1 - P(\u00acA \u2227 \u00acP).\n\nP(\u00acA) = 4/5, P(\u00acP) = 1/6.\n\nSince A and P are independent, P(\u00acA \u2227 \u00acP) = (4/5)(1/6) = 4/30 = 2/15.\n\nSo, P(A \u2228 P) = 1 - 2/15 = 13/15.\n\nSo, P(A \u2228 P and \u00acR) = P(\u00acR) * P(A \u2228 P) = (1/3) * (13/15) = 13/45.\n\nWait, but that's 13/45. Looking at the options, option E is 13/45.\n\nBut wait, let me check my reasoning again. Because I'm not entirely confident.\n\nAnother approach: the correct answer is given via non-cheating methods. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger. So, the probability is the sum of the probabilities where either Alan is correct and Roger is incorrect, plus Peter correct and Roger incorrect, minus the overlap where both Alan and Peter are correct and Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo, P = P(A \u2227 \u00acR) + P(P \u2227 \u00acR) - P(A \u2227 P \u2227 \u00acR).\n\nSince A, R, and P are independent, we can compute each term.\n\nP(A \u2227 \u00acR) = P(A) * P(\u00acR) = (1/5) * (1/3) = 1/15.\n\nP(P \u2227 \u00acR) = (5/6) * (1/3) = 5/18.\n\nP(A \u2227 P \u2227 \u00acR) = (1/5) * (5/6) * (1/3) = (1/5 * 5/6) * 1/3 = (1/6) * 1/3 = 1/18.\n\nSo, the sum is 1/15 +5/18 - 1/18.\n\nCompute 1/15 + (5-1)/18 = 1/15 + 4/18 = 1/15 + 2/9.\n\nFind a common denominator, which is 45.\n\n1/15 = 3/45, 2/9 = 10/45.\n\nSo, 3/45 +10/45 =13/45.\n\nSo, the probability is 13/45, which is option E.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, we analyze the scenarios where the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.\n\nSo, there are three friends: Alan, Roger, and Peter. Each of them is trying to answer a question on an exam. They each have different probabilities of getting the answer right. The question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. Hmm, right, so we're looking for the case where the answer is correct, but it's not because of Roger's cheating.\n\nLet me break down each person's probability:\n\n- Alan is guessing randomly, so his probability of being correct is 1/5.\n- Roger is cheating, so his probability is 2/3.\n- Peter is doing the work, so his probability is 5/6.\n\nWait, but how are they answering the question? Are they each answering independently? I think so, because the problem doesn't specify any other scenario. So each of them has their own probability of being right, and their attempts are independent events.\n\nThe question asks for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, I think that means that either Alan or Peter got it right, but not Roger. Or wait, no\u2014wait, maybe the question is about whether someone got it right without cheating. Oh, wait, no. The question is about the answer being correct but not via cheating. So, it's correct because either Alan or Peter got it right. Because if Roger got it right, that's via cheating. So we want the cases where either Alan or Peter is correct, but not Roger. Or maybe the other way around: the answer is correct, but it wasn't Roger who did it. So, the correct answer is achieved either by Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but maybe the way the problem is phrased, the question is whether someone (any of the three) got it right, but not through cheating. So, that would be either Alan or Peter getting it right, but not Roger. But wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the question is correctly answered, but the method wasn't cheating, which would mean that either Alan or Peter was correct. But I need to think about the setup.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So the correct answer is achieved without cheating. So, either Alan or Peter got it right, but not Roger. Or, maybe the question is answered correctly, and the answer came from someone who didn't cheat. Hmm. So, the correct answer is achieved via either Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger did. But wait, do all three answer the question, and the question is considered answered correctly if at least one of them got it right? Or is each of them answering separately, and the question is whether any of them got it correct without cheating?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to model the scenario more clearly. Let's assume that each of the three friends is answering the question independently. So, Alan has a 1/5 chance, Roger 2/3, and Peter 5/6.\n\nThe question is, what is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given, but not by Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer could be from Alan or Peter, but not from Roger. But wait, wait a second\u2014could it be that the question is about whether the correct answer is achieved without cheating, meaning that the correct answer is from Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger answered correctly or not?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is whether the correct answer was achieved without cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, but not via Roger. So, the probability is that either Alan or Peter got it right, but not both? Or is it that at least one of them got it right, regardless of Roger's answer.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the events.\n\nLet me think: The question being answered correctly can happen in several ways. Let's consider all possible correct answers.\n\nCase 1: Only Alan is correct. So, Alan correct, Roger incorrect, Peter incorrect.\n\nCase 2: Only Roger is correct. Alan incorrect, Roger correct, Peter incorrect.\n\nCase 3: Only Peter is correct. Alan incorrect, Roger incorrect, Peter correct.\n\nCase 4: Alan and Roger correct, Peter incorrect.\n\nCase 5: Alan and Peter correct, Roger incorrect.\n\nCase 6: Roger and Peter correct, Alan incorrect.\n\nCase 7: All three correct.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, in other words, the correct answer is achieved by someone who didn't cheat. That would mean that the correct answer came from either Alan or Peter, but not Roger.\n\nWait, no. Because if someone who didn't cheat got it right, then the question is considered correctly answered without cheating. So, the question is answered correctly regardless of how it was done, but the method (cheating or not) is a factor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but the method wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer could be achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way to model this is to find the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, minus the cases where all three are correct (but I'm not sure). Hmm, no, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the event where the answer is correct, but the correct answer was not achieved via cheating. So, it's the probability that the correct answer came from either Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger did.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is phrased is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read the question.\n\nThe question is: \"What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?\"\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer is obtained via either Alan or Peter, not via Roger. So, the probability is that either Alan is correct, or Peter is correct, but Roger isn't necessarily correct. Or is it that the correct answer is obtained without Roger's cheating, regardless of whether someone else got it right.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to think about it is: the question is answered correctly, and the method (cheating or not) is not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter. So, the probability we're looking for is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, but not Roger. Or wait, no\u2014because the question is about whether the correct answer is achieved without cheating, which would include any scenario where Alan or Peter got it right, regardless of what Roger did. Because if Roger is correct, that's cheating, but if Alan or Peter are correct, that's non-cheating.\n\nWait, but the way the question is phrased, \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating\" suggests that the correct answer was achieved through non-cheating means. So, that would be the probability that the correct answer was from Alan or Peter, regardless of whether the other got it right or wrong.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but it's not because of Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer could be from Alan, Peter, or both, but not from Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly, which is the probability that at least one of Alan, Roger, or Peter is correct. But then subtract the probability that it's answered correctly via cheating (i.e., Roger is correct, and Alan and Peter are incorrect). Hmm, that might make sense.\n\nWait, let's think. The probability that the question is correctly answered is P(A \u2228 R \u2228 P). We need the probability that the question is correctly answered but not via cheating. So, that would be P(correct) minus P(correct via cheating).\n\nWhat's P(correct via cheating)? That's the probability that Roger is correct, and Alan and Peter are incorrect. Because if Roger is correct and Alan and Peter are incorrect, then the correct answer is via cheating.\n\nSo, the desired probability is P(A \u2228 R \u2228 P) - P(R \u2227 \u00acA \u2227 \u00acP).\n\nAlternatively, the desired probability is the probability that the correct answer was achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger got it right or not. Wait, no. Because if Roger got it right and Alan and Peter didn't, then the correct answer was via cheating. So, to get the correct answer via non-cheating, the correct answer must be achieved by Alan or Peter, but Roger could have either correct or incorrect, but the key is that the correct answer was achieved via non-cheating methods.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as: the correct answer is achieved without cheating, meaning that either Alan is correct, or Peter is correct, regardless of what Roger does. But wait, if Roger is correct, that's via cheating, so the correct answer is via cheating. So, the correct answer is not via cheating only if either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, no. Because if all three are correct, then the correct answer is via cheating (from Roger) and non-cheating (from Alan and Peter). So, the correct answer was achieved via both methods. But the question is about whether the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating. So, perhaps we need to calculate the probability that the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's correctness. But I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not by Roger. Because the question is about not via cheating, which is Roger's method.\n\nSo, the probability that the question is answered correctly without cheating is the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, regardless of whether Roger did or not. But wait, no\u2014because if the question is answered correctly by both Roger and, say, Alan, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating (Roger) and non-cheating (Alan). So, the fact that someone answered correctly via non-cheating doesn't mean that the correct answer isn't via cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the question was answered correctly, and the correct answer was given without cheating. So, that would be the case where the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger also got it right or not.\n\nWait, that doesn't make much sense. Because if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Roger, then the question was answered correctly, but it was via cheating as well as non-cheating. So, the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, would be the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. Hmm, I think I'm getting tangled here.\n\nLet me try to approach it another way. The question is answered correctly via cheating if Roger is correct, regardless of what Alan and Peter do. So, the correct answer via cheating is when Roger is correct, and the others can be either correct or not. But wait, no\u2014if the correct answer is given by Roger, but Alan or Peter also happen to be correct, that's still considered as the correct answer being via cheating because Roger's method is cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the desired probability is the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not. But that's not the same as the question's wording. The question is about the correct answer being given without cheating, which I think implies that the correct answer was given by someone who didn't cheat, which would be Alan or Peter.\n\nBut if all three are correct, then the correct answer was given via cheating (Roger) and via non-cheating (Alan and Peter). So, the question is, do we count that scenario as the correct answer being given without cheating? Because the correct answer was achieved by Alan and Peter.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question is just about whether the correct answer was given by someone who didn't cheat, regardless of whether others did. So, the correct answer could have been given by either Alan or Peter, or both, or all three, but as long as someone non-cheating (Alan or Peter) got it right.\n\nWait, but the question says, \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer is given, and the method used wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but not via Roger.\n\nWait, no, because if Roger is correct, that's via cheating, but the correct answer is still given. So, the question is about the correct answer being given, but the method wasn't cheating. So, perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger did.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way to model this is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly, but the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, not by Roger. So, in other words, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger also got it right.\n\nBut wait, if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer was given via cheating (Roger) and non-cheating (Alan). So, in that case, the correct answer was via cheating. So, the question is about the correct answer being given without cheating, so that would exclude cases where Roger is correct, regardless of whether Alan and Peter are correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think of it as the correct answer being achieved by non-cheating methods. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether the others are correct. So, the probability that either Alan is correct, or Peter is correct, or both.\n\nWait, but that would include cases where Roger is correct as well. So, that would not exclude cheating. So, perhaps that's not the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but Roger didn't contribute to it. But that's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly by someone who didn't cheat. That would be the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, regardless of what Roger did. Because if Roger answered correctly, that's via cheating, but if Alan or Peter answered correctly, that's via non-cheating. So, the probability that the correct answer is given via non-cheating is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of Roger.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because if all three are correct, then the correct answer was given via both cheating and non-cheating. But the question is about the probability that the correct answer is given without cheating. So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct because if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer was given via cheating as well as non-cheating. So, the correct answer is given via cheating, so the event we want is when the correct answer is given via non-cheating, i.e., only Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about whether the correct answer was given without cheating, so that the correct answer came from either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger's answer was correct or not. So, in this case, the probability would be P(Alan correct OR Peter correct), regardless of Roger's correctness.\n\nBut let's compute that. The probability that Alan or Peter is correct is P(A) + P(P) - P(A and P). Because they might both be correct.\n\nSo, P(A) = 1/5, P(P) =5/6. P(A and P) is (1/5)*(5/6) = (1/5)*(5/6) = 1/6. So, P(A or P) = 1/5 +5/6 - 1/6 = (6/30 +25/30) -5/30 = (31/30 -5/30) =26/30 =13/15.\n\nBut wait, if we consider that the correct answer is given via non-cheating, then this would include cases where Roger is correct as well. Because the correct answer could have been given by both Alan and Roger. So, that approach might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given via non-cheating, regardless of whether it's also given via cheating. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger.\n\nSo, the probability that the correct answer is given via non-cheating is P(A \u2228 P). Because if either Alan or Peter is correct, then the correct answer is given via non-cheating.\n\nBut wait, if both Alan and Roger are correct, then the correct answer was given via both cheating and non-cheating. So, in that case, the correct answer was given via cheating, so that scenario would not be counted in our desired probability.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let's think of it as the correct answer is given without cheating, which would mean that the correct answer came from Alan or Peter, and not from Roger. So, we need the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger.\n\nWait, no. Because the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer was given via non-cheating. So, the correct answer could have been given by Alan, Peter, both, or all three, but the key is that the correct answer was given via non-cheating, regardless of whether it was also given via cheating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether it's also given by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating, which includes any scenario where Alan or Peter is correct.\n\nBut I think I'm not correctly interpreting the question. Let me try to rephrase it. The problem asks for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, but the method used wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer was achieved by Alan or Peter. So, the probability is that either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of what Roger does.\n\nBut wait, if all three are correct, then the correct answer was achieved via both cheating and non-cheating. So, in that case, the correct answer was achieved via cheating as well, so it's not just non-cheating. So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating, which would be the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the correct answer could be given by all three. So, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probability that the correct answer is given by at least one of Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger does.\n\nWait, but if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was given via cheating. So, the correct answer being given without cheating would require that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was given via cheating, which is what we're excluding.\n\nAh, that makes sense. So, the correct answer is given without cheating only if the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo, the probability we're looking for is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, no. Because if both Alan and Peter are correct, and Roger is incorrect, then the correct answer is given via non-cheating. If Alan is correct, Roger is incorrect, Peter is incorrect, that's a case where the correct answer is given via non-cheating. Similarly, if Peter is correct, and the others are incorrect, that's another case.\n\nBut if both Alan and Peter are correct, and Roger is incorrect, that's still a case where the correct answer is given via non-cheating. So, the correct way to model this is to find the probability that either Alan is correct and Roger is incorrect, or Peter is correct and Roger is incorrect, or both Alan and Peter are correct and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, but this can be simplified. Because the correct answer is given without cheating if either Alan or Peter is correct, but not if Roger is correct. Wait, no. Because if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer was given via cheating as well as non-cheating, so in that case, the correct answer was given via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to calculate the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger.\n\nWait, no. Because if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Peter, then it's given via non-cheating, regardless of Roger. So, the correct answer is given via non-cheating if either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of whether Roger is correct.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was given via cheating, which is what we're excluding. So, the correct answer is given without cheating only if the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger.\n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let's try to model it mathematically.\n\nThe probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating is equal to the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, minus the cases where the correct answer is also given by Roger. Or, perhaps more accurately, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is given via non-cheating methods, and not via cheating.\n\nSo, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger. So, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) - P(R) * P(A \u2228 P), but that's not right.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute the probability that the correct answer is given via non-cheating, which is the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nSo, let me compute the probability that the correct answer is given via non-cheating: that is, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger.\n\nSo, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger. So, the events are:\n\nEither Alan is correct and Roger is incorrect,\n\nOR Peter is correct and Roger is incorrect,\n\nOR both Alan and Peter are correct and Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A and not R) + P(P and not R) - P(A and P and not R).\n\nWait, no, because P(A and not R) includes cases where Peter is incorrect, and P(P and not R) includes cases where Alan is incorrect. So, the correct way is to compute P(A \u2228 P) given that R is false.\n\nAlternatively, the correct way is to compute the probability that (A \u2228 P) and not R.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because if R is correct, then the correct answer was given via cheating, which we want to exclude. So, the correct approach is to compute the probability that (A \u2228 P) is true, and R is false.\n\nSo, the event is (A \u2228 P) \u2227 (\u00acR). So, the probability we need is P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ).\n\nHmm, but wait, perhaps the correct answer is given via non-cheating if either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of whether Roger is correct. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was given via cheating, which we're excluding. So, the correct answer is given via non-cheating if either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, no. Because if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer was given via cheating, which we want to exclude. So, the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger. So, that's the same as (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P and \u00acR).\n\nTo compute this, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events, but with the condition that R is false.\n\nSo, first, compute the probability that R is false. P(\u00acR) = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nThen, compute the probability that A \u2228 P is true given that R is false. Since A and P are independent of R, because each person answers independently.\n\nSo, P(A \u2228 P | \u00acR) = P(A \u2228 P) because R's correctness doesn't affect A and P's correctness.\n\nWait, no. Because if R is false, it doesn't change the probabilities of A and P. So, P(A \u2228 P | \u00acR) = P(A \u2228 P).\n\nWait, but A and P are independent of R. So, P(A \u2228 P | \u00acR) = P(A \u2228 P). Because whether R is correct or not doesn't influence A or P.\n\nSo, P(A \u2228 P) is 1 - P(\u00acA \u2227 \u00acP).\n\nP(\u00acA) = 4/5, P(\u00acP) = 1/6.\n\nSince A and P are independent, P(\u00acA \u2227 \u00acP) = (4/5)(1/6) = 4/30 = 2/15.\n\nSo, P(A \u2228 P) = 1 - 2/15 = 13/15.\n\nSo, P(A \u2228 P and \u00acR) = P(\u00acR) * P(A \u2228 P) = (1/3) * (13/15) = 13/45.\n\nWait, but that's 13/45. Looking at the options, option E is 13/45.\n\nBut wait, let me check my reasoning again. Because I'm not entirely confident.\n\nAnother approach: the correct answer is given via non-cheating methods. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger. So, the probability is the sum of the probabilities where either Alan is correct and Roger is incorrect, plus Peter correct and Roger incorrect, minus the overlap where both Alan and Peter are correct and Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo, P = P(A \u2227 \u00acR) + P(P \u2227 \u00acR) - P(A \u2227 P \u2227 \u00acR).\n\nSince A, R, and P are independent, we can compute each term.\n\nP(A \u2227 \u00acR) = P(A) * P(\u00acR) = (1/5) * (1/3) = 1/15.\n\nP(P \u2227 \u00acR) = (5/6) * (1/3) = 5/18.\n\nP(A \u2227 P \u2227 \u00acR) = (1/5) * (5/6) * (1/3) = (1/5 * 5/6) * 1/3 = (1/6) * 1/3 = 1/18.\n\nSo, the sum is 1/15 +5/18 - 1/18.\n\nCompute 1/15 + (5-1)/18 = 1/15 + 4/18 = 1/15 + 2/9.\n\nFind a common denominator, which is 45.\n\n1/15 = 3/45, 2/9 = 10/45.\n\nSo, 3/45 +10/45 =13/45.\n\nSo, the probability is 13/45, which is option E.\n\n\nTo determine the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, we analyze the scenarios where the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. The probabilities of each individual answering correctly are as follows:\n\n- **Alan**: \\( P(A) = \\frac{1}{5} \\)\n- **Roger (cheating)**: \\( P(R) = \\frac{2}{3} \\)\n- **Peter**: \\( P(P) = \\frac{5}{6} \\)\n\nThe probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating corresponds to the event where either Alan or Peter answers correctly, and Roger does not. This can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nP((A \\lor P) \\land \\neg R)\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Compute \\( P(\\neg R) \\)\nThe probability that Roger does not answer correctly is:\n\\[\nP(\\neg R) = 1 - P(R) = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Compute \\( P(A \\lor P) \\)\nThe probability that either Alan or Peter answers correctly is:\n\\[\nP(A \\lor P) = 1 - P(\\neg A \\land \\neg P)\n\\]\nSince Alan and Peter answer independently:\n\\[\nP(\\neg A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{4}{5}, \\quad P(\\neg P) = 1 - P(P) = 1 - \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{1}{6}\n\\]\n\\[\nP(\\neg A \\land \\neg P) = P(\\neg A) \\cdot P(\\neg P) = \\frac{4}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{4}{30} = \\frac{2}{15}\n\\]\n\\[\nP(A \\lor P) = 1 - \\frac{2}{15} = \\frac{13}{15}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Compute \\( P((A \\lor P) \\land \\neg R) \\)\nSince \\( A \\), \\( P \\), and \\( R \\) are independent, the probability that \\( (A \\lor P) \\) occurs and \\( \\neg R \\) occurs is:\n\\[\nP((A \\lor P) \\land \\neg R) = P(A \\lor P) \\cdot P(\\neg R) = \\frac{13}{15} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{13}{45}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{13}{45}}\n\\]\n\nAnswer: E",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nSo, the question is about three friends: Alan, Roger, and Peter. They each have different probabilities of answering a question correctly. The twist is that I need to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. Hmm, right, so cheating probably refers to Roger's method since he's the one looking at someone else's paper.\n\nLet me break down what each person's probability is:\n\n- Alan guesses randomly, so his probability of being correct is 1/5.\n- Roger cheats, so his probability is 2/3. But wait, the question says we don't want the correct answer via cheating, so Roger's correct answer wouldn't count towards our desired probability. Or does it? Wait, no, the problem is to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So we need the correct answer to come from either Alan or Peter, but not from Roger. Because if Roger answers correctly, that's via cheating, so we exclude that.\n\nWait, but wait. No, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. The question is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer must be achieved without cheating. So, only Alan and Peter's correct answers count. But wait, how are they answering? Are they all attempting the same question? I think so.\n\nWait, the way the problem is phrased, each of them is answering the question, and the question is whether the correct answer is achieved without cheating. So, the correct answer could be achieved by Alan or Peter, but not via Roger's cheating. So, the probability that the correct answer is achieved through either Alan or Peter, but not through Roger.\n\nBut wait, no. Let me think again. The question is: the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not because of cheating. So, the correct answer must come from either Alan or Peter.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is that the question is answered correctly, but the way it was answered wasn't via cheating. So, the correct answer could be by Alan or Peter. But wait, Roger might have answered correctly via cheating, but we don't want that.\n\nWait, but perhaps the way to think about it is, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not through Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer could be from either Alan or Peter, but not Roger. So, we have to find the probability that either Alan or Peter answers correctly, but Roger does not, and the question is considered correct if at least one of them answers correctly.\n\nWait, no, the problem says the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, if the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, that's acceptable. If it's achieved by Roger, that's via cheating, which we don't want. So, the correct answer is achieved, but not via cheating.\n\nBut wait, the problem is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved through either Alan or Peter, but not via Roger's method.\n\nWait, but perhaps the way to model this is to consider the probability that either Alan or Peter answers correctly, but Roger doesn't. Because if Roger answers correctly, that's via cheating, and we don't want that. So, the correct answer is either from Alan or Peter, but not from Roger.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The question is about whether the correct answer is achieved, but it's not via cheating. So, the correct answer must come from either Alan or Peter. But wait, the problem is that all three are answering the question. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved when at least one of them gets it right, but without Roger being the one who got it via cheating.\n\nWait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the question is that the correct answer is achieved, but it's not because of Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer must have come from either Alan or Peter. So, the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Because the question is about the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but not via cheating. So, if the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, that's acceptable. If the correct answer is achieved by Roger, that's via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is that the correct answer is achieved by at least one person, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and perhaps Roger didn't answer correctly. Or, maybe it's that the correct answer is achieved, and the method used was not cheating, which would mean that it's achieved by either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's read the problem again.\n\nThe question is: What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not through cheating. So, the correct answer must have come from either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but how? Because all three are attempting the same question. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved when at least one of them (Alan or Peter) answers correctly, but Roger doesn't answer correctly. Because if Roger answers correctly, that's via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by any of them, but not via cheating. So, if the correct answer comes from Alan or Peter, that's fine. But if the correct answer comes from Roger (cheating), then it's not acceptable. So, we need the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but that might not be the right way to model it. Let me think in terms of events.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- Event A: Alan answers correctly. P(A) = 1/5.\n- Event R: Roger answers correctly. P(R) = 2/3.\n- Event P: Peter answers correctly. P(P) = 5/6.\n\nWe need the probability that the question is answered correctly (so, at least one of them answers correctly), but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved through either Alan or Peter, but not via Roger.\n\nWait, no. The question is whether the correct answer is achieved, but not via cheating. So, if the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, that's acceptable. But if the correct answer is achieved by Roger, that's via cheating, which is not acceptable.\n\nSo, the probability we're looking for is the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nWait, but how? Because the correct answer could be achieved by multiple people. But perhaps the way the question is phrased is that the question is answered correctly, but not through cheating, which would mean that the correct answer comes from either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should model it as the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter answers correctly, and Roger does not. Because if Roger answers correctly, that's via cheating, and we don't want that.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the desired event is that (A or P) occurs, and R does not occur. So, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) \u2227 not R.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because if R occurs, then the correct answer is via cheating, which we don't want. So, the desired scenario is that the correct answer is achieved by A or P, but R does not achieve it.\n\nWait, but perhaps the correct answer is achieved by at least one of the three, but we want the cases where the correct answer is achieved by A or P, and not by R. So, the probability that the correct answer is achieved by A or P, and R does not achieve it.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. The question is, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not via cheating. So, the correct answer could have been achieved by A or P, but not by R.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by any of them, but we only want the cases where it's achieved by A or P. So, the probability that the correct answer is achieved by A or P, regardless of whether R achieves it or not. But that can't be, because if R achieves it, that's via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by at least one person, but not via R. So, the correct answer is achieved by either A or P, but not R. So, the events we're considering are when the correct answer is achieved by A or P, but R does not achieve it.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the way to model it. So, the probability is the probability that (A \u2228 P) occurs, and R does not occur.\n\nBut wait, that's not correct, because if A or P occurs, the question is answered correctly, but if R occurs, that's via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, but whether via cheating or not. So, the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but not via cheating, would be the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either A or P, but not by R. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by either A or P, and R does not achieve it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by at least one of the three, but it's not via R. So, the correct answer is achieved by A or P, but not by R.\n\nWait, but that's not possible because if R answers correctly, then the correct answer is achieved via cheating, which we don't want. So, the correct answer is achieved by A or P, and R does not answer correctly.\n\nWait, so perhaps the desired probability is P(A \u2228 P) * (1 - P(R)).\n\nWait, no, because A, P, and R are independent events. So, the probability that the correct answer is achieved by A or P, and R does not achieve it, would be the probability that (A \u2228 P) occurs, and R does not occur.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because if R occurs, the correct answer is achieved via cheating, which we don't want. So, we need the cases where the correct answer is achieved by A or P, and R doesn't answer correctly. So, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) \u2227 (not R).\n\nBut wait, that's the same as P( (A \u2228 P) and not R ).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved by A or P, and not achieved by R. So, the correct answer is achieved by A or P, and R doesn't answer correctly.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly correct because the correct answer could be achieved by multiple people. So, perhaps the way to model it is that the correct answer is achieved by at least one of A or P, but R does not answer correctly. So, the events where (A or P is correct) and R is incorrect.\n\nSo, the formula would be P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR )\n\nBut to compute this, we can use inclusion-exclusion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either A or P, and R does not answer correctly.\n\nSo, let me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, find P(A \u2228 P) which is the probability that either Alan or Peter answers correctly. Since A and P are independent, because their probabilities are based on their own actions.\n\nWait, are A and P independent? Well, the problem doesn't specify any dependencies between their answers, so I can assume they're independent events.\n\nSo, P(A \u2228 P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A) * P(P).\n\nBecause for independent events, P(A \u2227 P) = P(A) * P(P).\n\nSo, P(A \u2228 P) = 1/5 + 5/6 - (1/5 * 5/6) = let's compute that.\n\n1/5 is 0.2, 5/6 is approximately 0.8333. Their product is 0.2 * 0.8333 \u2248 0.1666667.\n\nSo, 0.2 + 0.8333 \u2248 1.0333 minus 0.1666667 equals approximately 0.8666667. Wait, that can't be right because the maximum probability can't exceed 1. So, I must have made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, let me compute it properly.\n\n1/5 is 6/30, 5/6 is 25/30. So, P(A) + P(P) = 6/30 + 25/30 = 31/30. But since probabilities can't exceed 1, we subtract P(A)*P(P), which is (1/5)*(5/6) = (1*5)/(5*6) = 5/30 = 1/6.\n\nSo, 31/30 - 1/6 = 31/30 - 5/30 = 26/30 = 13/15.\n\nSo, P(A \u2228 P) = 13/15.\n\nNow, we need the probability that (A \u2228 P) occurs and R does not occur. So, since R is independent of A and P, the combined probability would be P(A \u2228 P) * (1 - P(R)).\n\nWait, is that correct? Because if the events are independent, then the occurrence of A or P doesn't affect R.\n\nSo, P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR).\n\nBecause A, P, and R are independent events, so the occurrence of A or P doesn't affect R's outcome.\n\nSo, P(\u00acR) is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nSo, the desired probability is (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/45.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 13/45. So, that's one of the options.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is that correct? Because this approach assumes that if either A or P answers correctly, regardless of R, but R doesn't answer correctly. So, the correct answer is achieved by A or P, and R doesn't achieve it.\n\nWait, but what if all three answer correctly? Then the correct answer is achieved, but via cheating (by R), which we don't want. So, the correct answer being achieved by A or P, and R not achieving it, is the correct scenario.\n\nWait, but perhaps another approach: The correct answer is achieved without cheating if either A or P answers correctly, and R does not answer correctly. So, the probability is P(A correct and R incorrect) + P(P correct and R incorrect) - P(A and P correct and R incorrect).\n\nWait, but since A and P are independent, and R is independent of both, perhaps it's easier to compute as P(A correct) * (1 - P(R)) + P(P correct) * (1 - P(R)) - P(A correct) * P(P correct) * (1 - P(R)).\n\nWait, but that's the same as (P(A) + P(P) - P(A)P(P)) ) * (1 - P(R)), which is exactly what I did before. So, 13/15 * 1/3 = 13/45.\n\nSo, the answer would be E) 13/45.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA) 1/18 \u2248 0.0556\n\nB)1/9 \u2248 0.1111\n\nC)23/90 \u2248 0.2556\n\nD)5/18 \u2248 0.2778\n\nE)13/45 \u2248 0.2889\n\nHmm, 13/45 is about 0.2889.\n\nWait, but another approach: The correct answer is achieved via not cheating, so it's when either A or P answers correctly, but not R. So, the correct answer is achieved by A or P, and R does not answer correctly.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the correct answer is achieved if at least one of A or P is correct, and R is incorrect. So, the correct answer is achieved without cheating.\n\nWait, but perhaps the correct answer is achieved if any of them is correct, but we need it to be achieved without cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by A or P, but not by R. So, the probability is the probability that the correct answer is achieved by A or P, and R does not answer correctly.\n\nWait, but I'm getting the same result as before. So, 13/15 * 1/3 = 13/45, which is option E.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing any other scenario. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by A or P, regardless of R's action. So, the correct answer is achieved, but not via R's cheating. So, the probability would be P(A \u2228 P) times the probability that R does not answer correctly. Because if R answers correctly, that's via cheating, which we don't want. So, the correct answer is achieved via A or P, and R doesn't contribute to it.\n\nWait, but perhaps the correct answer is achieved by either A, R, or P. But we want the correct answer to be achieved, but not via R. So, the correct answer is achieved by A or P, but not by R.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is phrased, the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not through cheating (i.e., R didn't answer it correctly). So, the correct answer is achieved by either A or P, and R didn't answer correctly.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) * (1 - P(R)).\n\nWhich is 13/15 * 1/3 = 13/45.\n\nSo, the answer should be E) 13/45.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nSo, the question is about three friends: Alan, Roger, and Peter. They each have different probabilities of answering a question correctly. The twist is that I need to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. Hmm, right, so cheating probably refers to Roger's method since he's the one looking at someone else's paper.\n\nLet me break down what each person's probability is:\n\n- Alan guesses randomly, so his probability of being correct is 1/5.\n- Roger cheats, so his probability is 2/3. But wait, the question says we don't want the correct answer via cheating, so Roger's correct answer wouldn't count towards our desired probability. Or does it? Wait, no, the problem is to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So we need the correct answer to come from either Alan or Peter, but not from Roger. Because if Roger answers correctly, that's via cheating, so we exclude that.\n\nWait, but wait. No, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. The question is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer must be achieved without cheating. So, only Alan and Peter's correct answers count. But wait, how are they answering? Are they all attempting the same question? I think so.\n\nWait, the way the problem is phrased, each of them is answering the question, and the question is whether the correct answer is achieved without cheating. So, the correct answer could be achieved by Alan or Peter, but not via Roger's cheating. So, the probability that the correct answer is achieved through either Alan or Peter, but not through Roger.\n\nBut wait, no. Let me think again. The question is: the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not because of cheating. So, the correct answer must come from either Alan or Peter.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is that the question is answered correctly, but the way it was answered wasn't via cheating. So, the correct answer could be by Alan or Peter. But wait, Roger might have answered correctly via cheating, but we don't want that.\n\nWait, but perhaps the way to think about it is, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not through Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer could be from either Alan or Peter, but not Roger. So, we have to find the probability that either Alan or Peter answers correctly, but Roger does not, and the question is considered correct if at least one of them answers correctly.\n\nWait, no, the problem says the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, if the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, that's acceptable. If it's achieved by Roger, that's via cheating, which we don't want. So, the correct answer is achieved, but not via cheating.\n\nBut wait, the problem is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved through either Alan or Peter, but not via Roger's method.\n\nWait, but perhaps the way to model this is to consider the probability that either Alan or Peter answers correctly, but Roger doesn't. Because if Roger answers correctly, that's via cheating, and we don't want that. So, the correct answer is either from Alan or Peter, but not from Roger.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The question is about whether the correct answer is achieved, but it's not via cheating. So, the correct answer must come from either Alan or Peter. But wait, the problem is that all three are answering the question. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved when at least one of them gets it right, but without Roger being the one who got it via cheating.\n\nWait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the question is that the correct answer is achieved, but it's not because of Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer must have come from either Alan or Peter. So, the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Because the question is about the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but not via cheating. So, if the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, that's acceptable. If the correct answer is achieved by Roger, that's via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is that the correct answer is achieved by at least one person, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and perhaps Roger didn't answer correctly. Or, maybe it's that the correct answer is achieved, and the method used was not cheating, which would mean that it's achieved by either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's read the problem again.\n\nThe question is: What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not through cheating. So, the correct answer must have come from either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but how? Because all three are attempting the same question. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved when at least one of them (Alan or Peter) answers correctly, but Roger doesn't answer correctly. Because if Roger answers correctly, that's via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by any of them, but not via cheating. So, if the correct answer comes from Alan or Peter, that's fine. But if the correct answer comes from Roger (cheating), then it's not acceptable. So, we need the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but that might not be the right way to model it. Let me think in terms of events.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- Event A: Alan answers correctly. P(A) = 1/5.\n- Event R: Roger answers correctly. P(R) = 2/3.\n- Event P: Peter answers correctly. P(P) = 5/6.\n\nWe need the probability that the question is answered correctly (so, at least one of them answers correctly), but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved through either Alan or Peter, but not via Roger.\n\nWait, no. The question is whether the correct answer is achieved, but not via cheating. So, if the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, that's acceptable. But if the correct answer is achieved by Roger, that's via cheating, which is not acceptable.\n\nSo, the probability we're looking for is the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nWait, but how? Because the correct answer could be achieved by multiple people. But perhaps the way the question is phrased is that the question is answered correctly, but not through cheating, which would mean that the correct answer comes from either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should model it as the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter answers correctly, and Roger does not.

Wait, that can't be right because the maximum probability can't exceed 1. So, I must have made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, let me compute it properly.\n\n1/5 is 6/30, 5/6 is 25/30. So, P(A) + P(P) = 6/30 + 25/30 = 31/30. But since probabilities can't exceed 1, we subtract P(A)*P(P), which is (1/5)*(5/6) = (1*5)/(5*6) = 5/30 = 1/6.\n\nSo, 31/30 - 1/6 = 31/30 - 5/30 = 26/30 = 13/15.\n\nSo, P(A \u2228 P) = 13/15.\n\nNow, we need the probability that (A \u2228 P) occurs and R does not occur. So, since R is independent of A and P, the combined probability would be P(A \u2228 P) * (1 - P(R)).\n\nWait, is that correct?

So, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not through cheating (i.e., R didn't answer it correctly). So, the correct answer is achieved by either A or P, and R didn't answer correctly.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) * (1 - P(R)).\n\nWhich is 13/15 * 1/3 = 13/45.\n\nSo, the answer should be E) 13/45.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. This means the correct answer must come from either Alan or Peter, and Roger's answer (via cheating) does not contribute to the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Define the probabilities\n- **Alan's probability of answering correctly**: \\( P(A) = \\frac{1}{5} \\)\n- **Roger's probability of answering correctly**: \\( P(R) = \\frac{2}{3} \\)\n- **Peter's probability of answering correctly**: \\( P(P) = \\frac{5}{6} \\)\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the probability that Alan or Peter answers correctly\nSince Alan and Peter's answers are independent, the probability that either Alan or Peter answers correctly is:\n\\[\nP(A \\cup P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A) \\cdot P(P)\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\nP(A \\cup P) = \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{5}{6} - \\left(\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{5}{6}\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\nP(A \\cup P) = \\frac{6}{30} + \\frac{25}{30} - \\frac{5}{30}\n\\]\n\\[\nP(A \\cup P) = \\frac{26}{30} = \\frac{13}{15}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Ensure Roger does not answer correctly\nThe probability that Roger does not answer correctly is:\n\\[\nP(\\neg R) = 1 - P(R) = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Combine the probabilities\nWe need the probability that Alan or Peter answers correctly **and** Roger does not answer correctly. Since the events are independent:\n\\[\nP((A \\cup P) \\cap \\neg R) = P(A \\cup P) \\cdot P(\\neg R)\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\nP((A \\cup P) \\cap \\neg R) = \\frac{13}{15} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{13}{45}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{13}{45}}\n\\]\n\n**Answer: E**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.\n\nThere are three friends: Alan, Roger, and Peter. Each of them is trying to answer a question on an exam. Their probabilities of getting it right are different.\n\nAlan is just guessing randomly, so his chance is 1/5. Roger is cheating by looking at the paper in front of him, giving him a 2/3 chance. Peter is doing the work properly, so he has a 5/6 probability of being correct.\n\nThe question is asking: What's the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?\n\nHmm. So I think this means that we need the probability that exactly one of them answers correctly, but it's either Alan or Peter who does, not Roger. Or wait, maybe it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved without cheating, so perhaps considering the cases where either Alan or Peter got it right, but not Roger.\n\nWait, no, maybe I should clarify. The question says \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved through non-cheating means. So we're looking for the cases where the correct answer is achieved either by Alan guessing correctly or by Peter working it out, but not by Roger cheating.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read the question. \"What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?\"\n\nAh, so the correct answer is achieved, but it's not through cheating. So that would mean that either Alan or Peter got it right, but not Roger. Because if Roger got it right via cheating, that's the cheating way. So we need the probability that the correct answer is achieved either by Alan or by Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but the setup is that each friend is attempting the question. So perhaps all three are answering, and the question is whether the answer is correct, but not due to cheating. So perhaps the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger's cheating. So the event we're interested in is that the question is correct, but the method used was not cheating. So that would be when either Alan or Peter answered correctly, regardless of what Roger did, but wait no\u2014because all three are answering, but the question is whether the answer is correct, and whether it's via cheating or not.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of the entire scenario. Let me model it.\n\nEach of the three friends is answering the question. We need to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but it wasn't due to cheating. So the correct answer is achieved, but not through Roger's cheating. So perhaps the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter. But wait, perhaps it's more about the method. So if Roger's answer is correct, that's via cheating. If Alan's or Peter's is correct, that's non-cheating.\n\nBut wait, what if more than one person gets it right? The question says \"the question is answered correctly\"\u2014so perhaps it's considering the case where at least one of them answers correctly. But the wording is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps the question is whether the correct answer is achieved in a way that doesn't involve cheating, meaning that either Alan or Peter got it right, but Roger didn't.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is that the correct answer is achieved, and the method wasn't cheating. So it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter. But that's not necessarily the case. Because maybe all three got it right, but some via cheating. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as the probability that the correct answer is given, and that it's due to either Alan or Peter, not Roger. So the event is that the correct answer is given, and it's through non-cheating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not by Roger. So that would include cases where Alan or Peter got it right, regardless of whether Roger did or didn't.\n\nWait, but the wording is \"but not via cheating.\" So if Roger's answer is correct, that's via cheating. So perhaps we're looking for the probability that the question is correct, but it's not because of Roger's cheating. So that would be the probability that either Alan or Peter got it right, but Roger didn't. Or perhaps the correct answer is achieved, but it wasn't through Roger's cheating. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me break it down.\n\nWe have three events:\n\nA: Alan answers correctly. P(A) = 1/5.\n\nR: Roger answers correctly. P(R) = 2/3.\n\nP: Peter answers correctly. P(P) =5/6.\n\nWe're to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So the correct answer is achieved, but it's not via Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, but how does that work? Because the question is being answered by all three, and the correct answer is known. So perhaps the event is that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nWait, maybe the correct answer is achieved, but it's not because Roger cheated. So perhaps the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter. But wait, what if both Alan and Roger got it right? Then the correct answer is achieved, but it's via Roger's cheating. So that case would not be included in the desired probability.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is to consider all possible scenarios where the answer is correct, but the cheating didn't contribute to that correctness. So the correct answer is achieved either by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, no. Because the correct answer is the same regardless of who got it right. So perhaps the question is whether the correct answer is achieved, and whether it was achieved via cheating or not.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as the probability that the correct answer is achieved without cheating, i.e., the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about possible approaches.\n\nAnother approach: The question is about the probability that the answer is correct, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, but the method wasn't cheating. That is, the correct answer came from either Alan or Peter, not Roger.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the correct answer is given, and that it's not Roger who provided it through cheating.\n\nWait, but the way the question is phrased, it's not clear whether we're considering the correct answer being given by any of them, but not through cheating. So perhaps we're looking for the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, but Roger didn't.\n\nWait, no. Because if all three answer, and the correct answer is the same, perhaps the question is whether the correct answer was achieved via a non-cheating method. So perhaps the correct answer was achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger got it right.\n\nWait, maybe the way to approach this is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating (i.e., by Alan or Peter) and subtract the cases where Roger's cheating caused the correct answer. Hmm, that might not be the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved, and the method wasn't cheating, so the event is that the correct answer was achieved by either Alan or Peter. But since all three are answering, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by any of them, but we want to exclude the cases where it was Roger who did it via cheating.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's model it more formally.\n\nWe can model this as the union of two events: either Alan answers correctly and Roger doesn't, or Peter answers correctly and Roger doesn't. Because if Roger answers correctly, that's via cheating, so we don't want that scenario to contribute to our desired probability. Wait, but what if both Alan and Peter answer correctly? Then the correct answer is achieved, but it's via non-cheating, so that's acceptable.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the desired probability is the probability that the correct answer is achieved via either Alan or Peter. So that would include cases where either one or both answered correctly, but Roger didn't contribute to it via cheating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved, but the way it was achieved (by whom) wasn't via cheating. So the correct answer could be achieved by Alan, Peter, or both, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way to model this is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger also got it right. But since the question is about whether the correct answer is achieved, perhaps we're considering that as long as at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly, regardless of Roger's action. But that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved when at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, but Roger is incorrect. No, that doesn't make sense either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but not through Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, but it wasn't Roger who did it. So that would be the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but if the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, then regardless of Roger's answer, the correct answer is present. So perhaps the correct answer is achieved, and it's not via Roger. So the desired probability is the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't answer correctly.\n\nWait, that might not be accurate. Because even if Roger answered correctly, as long as Alan or Peter also answered correctly, the correct answer was achieved via non-cheating as well. Hmm.\n\nI think I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach.\n\nThe problem is to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So the correct answer is achieved, but the method used was not cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not via Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, but the correct answer could be achieved by both Alan and Roger, but we don't want to include the cases where it was Roger's cheating that caused the correct answer. So perhaps the desired probability is the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, irrespective of Roger's action. But wait, no, because if the correct answer is achieved by Roger via cheating, that's a case we need to exclude.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved, and it's not via Roger's cheating. So the correct answer could be achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to calculate this is to find the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger achieved it as well. But that would include cases where, say, both Alan and Roger got it right, but we don't want that because the correct answer was achieved via cheating as well.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and that Roger did not achieve it via cheating. So that the correct answer is achieved through non-cheating, not through cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the correct approach. So the desired probability is the probability that (Alan answered correctly OR Peter answered correctly) AND Roger did NOT answer correctly.\n\nWait, but that would exclude the cases where Roger's answer is correct, but include cases where both Alan and Peter are correct, as long as Roger isn't. Hmm.\n\nLet me model it as:\n\nP(Correct without cheating) = P( (A correct OR P correct) AND R incorrect )\n\nBecause if either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect, then the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating. Because if Roger were correct, that would be via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nWait, but is that the case? Because if Roger is incorrect, then the only way the correct answer is achieved is via Alan or Peter. But if Roger is incorrect, but both Alan and Peter are correct, then the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating, which is what we want.\n\nSo the formula would be:\n\nP = P( (A \u222a P) ) * P( not R )\n\nWait, no, because (A \u222a P) is the event that either Alan or Peter is correct, and (not R) is the event that Roger is incorrect. But these events are independent? Because Alan's success doesn't affect Roger's, etc.\n\nWait, no, because the events are independent. So the joint probability would be P(A \u222a P) * P(not R).\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should calculate it as P( (A OR P) AND (NOT R) ).\n\nSo let's compute that.\n\nFirst, compute P(A OR P). Since Alan and Peter's successes are independent, P(A OR P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A) * P(P).\n\nWait, wait, no: P(A OR P) is the probability that either Alan is correct or Peter is correct or both. So P(A \u222a P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A) * P(P).\n\nSo P(A) is 1/5, P(P) is 5/6.\n\nSo P(A \u222a P) = (1/5) + (5/6) - (1/5)*(5/6).\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n1/5 is 0.2, 5/6 is approximately 0.8333. 1/5 *5/6 is 1/6 \u2248 0.1667.\n\nSo 0.2 + 0.8333 = 1.0333, minus 0.1667 gives 0.8666, which is 5/6 + 1/5 - (1/5)(5/6) = let me compute it exactly.\n\n1/5 is 6/30, 5/6 is 25/30. So 6/30 +25/30 =31/30. Then subtract (1/5)(5/6) = (5/30) = 1/6. So 31/30 - 5/30 = 26/30 = 13/15.\n\nSo P(A \u222a P) = 13/15.\n\nThen, P(not R) is the probability that Roger didn't answer correctly. Since P(R) is 2/3, P(not R) is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nSo the joint probability P( (A \u222a P) AND (not R) ) is P(A \u222a P) * P(not R) because the events are independent.\n\nSo 13/15 * 1/3 = 13/45.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Because A, P, and R are independent events. So the joint probability is the product.\n\nSo 13/45 is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, the question is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So the correct answer is achieved, but not through Roger's cheating.\n\nBut in this model, the correct answer is achieved if either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger isn't. But what if Roger is incorrect, but both Alan and Peter are correct? Then the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating, which is what we want. So this approach seems correct.\n\nSo the probability is 13/45, which is option E.\n\nWait, but let me think again. What if all three are correct? Then the correct answer is achieved, but Roger's correct answer is via cheating, but the correct answer is also achieved via Alan and Peter. So in that case, the correct answer is achieved via both cheating and non-cheating methods. But the question is about the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but not via cheating. So in that case, the correct answer was achieved via non-cheating, but also via cheating. So would that scenario count towards our desired probability?\n\nHmm, perhaps the question is about whether the correct answer was achieved without cheating, regardless of whether it was also achieved via cheating. So in that case, if at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly, regardless of Roger's answer, that would be a success. But wait, no, because the question says \"but not via cheating.\" So perhaps we need the correct answer to have been achieved without using Roger's cheating, i.e., without Roger being correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to think about it is: the correct answer is achieved, but it was not through Roger's cheating. So the correct answer could have been achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nSo the scenario where all three are correct would still count towards the desired probability because the correct answer was achieved via Alan and Peter. So in that case, the correct answer was achieved via non-cheating methods.\n\nBut wait, in that scenario, Roger also achieved it via cheating, but the correct answer was also achieved via non-cheating. So perhaps the event we're interested in is that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's actions. But that's not exactly what the question is asking. The question says \"but not via cheating,\" which might imply that the correct answer was achieved without any cheating involved.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not. Because if the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, that's via non-cheating, even if Roger also got it right via cheating.\n\nBut wait, that's a different interpretation. So the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating, regardless of whether it's also achieved via cheating. So in that case, the desired probability is P(A \u222a P), which is 13/15. But that's not one of the options. The options are 1/18, 1/9, 23/90, 5/18, 13/45.\n\nWait, but perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved without cheating, meaning that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So the correct answer is achieved, but it wasn't via Roger's cheating. So in other words, the correct answer was achieved by Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it right.\n\nSo that's the same as P( (A \u222a P) AND (not R) ), which we computed as 13/45. Which is option E.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by exactly one person, and that person is not Roger. So the correct answer is achieved only by Alan or only by Peter.\n\nBut that would be a different scenario. Let me compute that.\n\nThe probability that exactly Alan is correct and Roger and Peter are incorrect.\n\nP(A) * P(not R) * P(not P) = (1/5) * (1/3) * (1 - 5/6) = (1/5)*(1/3)*(1/6) = 1/(5*3*6) = 1/90.\n\nSimilarly, the probability that exactly Peter is correct and Roger and Alan are incorrect.\n\nP(not A) * P(not R) * P(P) = (4/5) * (1/3) * (5/6) = (4/5)*(1/3)*(5/6) = (4/5)*(5/18) )= (4/18) = 2/9.\n\nWait, 4/5 * 5/6 is (4*5)/(5*6) )= 4/6 = 2/3. Then multiplied by 1/3 gives (2/3)*(1/3)= 2/9.\n\nSo the total for exactly Alan and exactly Peter is 1/90 + 2/9 = (1 + 20)/90 = 21/90 = 7/30. That's approximately 0.2333.\n\nBut looking at the options, E is 13/45, which is approximately 0.2888, and option C is 23/90 \u2248 0.2555.\n\nHmm, but earlier when I considered P( (A \u222a P) AND (not R) ), I got 13/45, which is about 0.2888. But when considering the cases where exactly Alan or exactly Peter answered correctly, and R is incorrect, I got 7/30, which is 21/90, which is 7/30 \u2248 0.2333.\n\nSo which approach is correct?\n\nThe question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read the question again.\n\n\"What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?\"\n\nI think that the intended meaning is that the correct answer is achieved, but it's not through Roger's cheating. So that could include cases where both Alan and Peter got it right, and Roger didn't. Or where only Alan or only Peter got it right, and Roger didn't.\n\nSo the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and that Roger did not achieve it via cheating. So that's P( (A OR P) AND (not R) ), which is 13/45.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the correct answer being achieved through non-cheating methods (i.e., by Alan or Peter), regardless of whether Roger also achieved it via cheating. In that case, the probability would be P(A \u222a P) = 13/15. But that's not one of the options.\n\nWait, but the options given are:\n\nA)1/18\n\nB)1/9\n\nC)23/90\n\nD)5/18\n\nE)13/45\n\nSo 13/45 is option E, which is what I calculated earlier. So perhaps the intended answer is E.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Another way to approach this is to consider that the correct answer is achieved, but it's not through cheating. So the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nSo the correct answer being achieved via non-cheating is when either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is not correct. Because if Roger is correct, the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which we are to exclude.\n\nSo yes, that's the same as P( (A OR P) AND (NOT R) ) = 13/45.\n\nSo the correct answer is option E, 13/45.\n",

So it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter. But that's not necessarily the case. Because maybe all three got it right, but some via cheating. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as the probability that the correct answer is given, and that it's due to either Alan or Peter, not Roger. So the event is that the correct answer is given, and it's through non-cheating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not by Roger. So that would include cases where Alan or Peter got it right, regardless of whether Roger did or didn't.\n\nWait, but the wording is \"but not via cheating.\" So if Roger's answer is correct, that's via cheating. So perhaps we're looking for the probability that the question is correct, but it's not because of Roger's cheating. So that would be the probability that either Alan or Peter got it right, but Roger didn't. Or perhaps the correct answer is achieved, but it wasn't through Roger's cheating. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me break it down.\n\nWe have three events:\n\nA: Alan answers correctly. P(A) = 1/5.\n\nR: Roger answers correctly. P(R) = 2/3.\n\nP: Peter answers correctly. P(P) =5/6.\n\nWe're to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So the correct answer is achieved, but it's not via Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, but how does that work? Because the question is being answered by all three, and the correct answer is known. So perhaps the event is that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nWait, maybe the correct answer is achieved, but it's not because Roger cheated. So perhaps the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter. But wait, what if both Alan and Roger got it right? Then the correct answer is achieved, but it's via Roger's cheating. So that case would not be included in the desired probability.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is to consider all possible scenarios where the answer is correct, but the cheating didn't contribute to that correctness. So the correct answer is achieved either by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, no. Because the correct answer is the same regardless of who got it right. So perhaps the question is whether the correct answer is achieved, and whether it was achieved via cheating or not.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as the probability that the correct answer is achieved without cheating, i.e., the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about possible approaches.\n\nAnother approach: The question is about the probability that the answer is correct, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, but the method wasn't cheating. That is, the correct answer came from either Alan or Peter, not Roger.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the correct answer is given, and that it's not Roger who provided it through cheating.\n\nWait, but the way the question is phrased, it's not clear whether we're considering the correct answer being given by any of them, but not through cheating. So perhaps we're looking for the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, but Roger didn't.\n\nWait, no. Because if all three answer, and the correct answer is the same, perhaps the question is whether the correct answer was achieved via a non-cheating method. So perhaps the correct answer was achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger got it right.\n\nWait, maybe the way to approach this is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating (i.e., by Alan or Peter) and subtract the cases where Roger's cheating caused the correct answer. Hmm, that might not be the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved, and the method wasn't cheating, so the event is that the correct answer was achieved by either Alan or Peter. But since all three are answering, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by any of them, but we want to exclude the cases where it was Roger who did it via cheating.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's model it more formally.\n\nWe can model this as the union of two events: either Alan answers correctly and Roger doesn't, or Peter answers correctly and Roger doesn't. Because if Roger answers correctly, that's via cheating, so we don't want that scenario to contribute to our desired probability. Wait, but what if both Alan and Peter answer correctly? Then the correct answer is achieved, but it's via non-cheating, so that's acceptable.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the desired probability is the probability that the correct answer is achieved via either Alan or Peter. So that would include cases where either one or both answered correctly, but Roger didn't contribute to it via cheating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved, but the way it was achieved (by whom) wasn't via cheating. So the correct answer could be achieved by Alan, Peter, or both, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way to model this is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger also got it right. But since the question is about whether the correct answer is achieved, perhaps we're considering that as long as at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly, regardless of Roger's action. But that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved when at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, but Roger is incorrect. No, that doesn't make sense either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but not through Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, but it wasn't Roger who did it. So that would be the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but if the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, then regardless of Roger's answer, the correct answer is present. So perhaps the correct answer is achieved, and it's not via Roger. So the desired probability is the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't answer correctly.\n\nWait, that might not be accurate. Because even if Roger answered correctly, as long as Alan or Peter also answered correctly, the correct answer was achieved via non-cheating as well. Hmm.\n\nI think I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach.\n\nThe problem is to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So the correct answer is achieved, but the method used was not cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not via Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, but the correct answer could be achieved by both Alan and Roger, but we don't want to include the cases where it was Roger's cheating that caused the correct answer. So perhaps the desired probability is the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, irrespective of Roger's action. But wait, no, because if the correct answer is achieved by Roger via cheating, that's a case we need to exclude.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved, and it's not via Roger's cheating. So the correct answer could be achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to calculate this is to find the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger achieved it as well. But that would include cases where, say, both Alan and Roger got it right, but we don't want that because the correct answer was achieved via cheating as well.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and that Roger did not achieve it via cheating. So that the correct answer is achieved through non-cheating, not through cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the correct approach. So the desired probability is the probability that (Alan answered correctly OR Peter answered correctly) AND Roger did NOT answer correctly.\n\nWait, but that would exclude the cases where Roger's answer is correct, but include cases where both Alan and Peter are correct, as long as Roger isn't. Hmm.\n\nLet me model it as:\n\nP(Correct without cheating) = P( (A correct OR P correct) AND R incorrect )\n\nBecause if either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect, then the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating. Because if Roger were correct, that would be via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nWait, but is that the case? Because if Roger is incorrect, then the only way the correct answer is achieved is via Alan or Peter. But if Roger is incorrect, but both Alan and Peter are correct, then the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating, which is what we want.\n\nSo the formula would be:\n\nP = P( (A \u222a P) ) * P( not R )\n\nWait, no, because (A \u222a P) is the event that either Alan or Peter is correct, and (not R) is the event that Roger is incorrect. But these events are independent? Because Alan's success doesn't affect Roger's, etc.\n\nWait, no, because the events are independent. So the joint probability would be P(A \u222a P) * P(not R).\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should calculate it as P( (A OR P) AND (NOT R) ).\n\nSo let's compute that.\n\nFirst, compute P(A OR P). Since Alan and Peter's successes are independent, P(A OR P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A) * P(P).\n\nWait, wait, no: P(A OR P) is the probability that either Alan is correct or Peter is correct or both. So P(A \u222a P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A) * P(P).\n\nSo P(A) is 1/5, P(P) is 5/6.\n\nSo P(A \u222a P) = (1/5) + (5/6) - (1/5)*(5/6).\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n1/5 is 0.2, 5/6 is approximately 0.8333. 1/5 *5/6 is 1/6 \u2248 0.1667.\n\nSo 0.2 + 0.8333 = 1.0333, minus 0.1667 gives 0.8666, which is 5/6 + 1/5 - (1/5)(5/6) = let me compute it exactly.\n\n1/5 is 6/30, 5/6 is 25/30. So 6/30 +25/30 =31/30. Then subtract (1/5)(5/6) = (5/30) = 1/6. So 31/30 - 5/30 = 26/30 = 13/15.\n\nSo P(A \u222a P) = 13/15.\n\nThen, P(not R) is the probability that Roger didn't answer correctly. Since P(R) is 2/3, P(not R) is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nSo the joint probability P( (A \u222a P) AND (not R) ) is P(A \u222a P) * P(not R) because the events are independent.\n\nSo 13/15 * 1/3 = 13/45.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Because A, P, and R are independent events. So the joint probability is the product.\n\nSo 13/45 is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, the question is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So the correct answer is achieved, but not through Roger's cheating.\n\nBut in this model, the correct answer is achieved if either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger isn't. But what if Roger is incorrect, but both Alan and Peter are correct? Then the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating, which is what we want. So this approach seems correct.\n\nSo the probability is 13/45, which is option E.\n\nWait, but let me think again. What if all three are correct? Then the correct answer is achieved, but Roger's correct answer is via cheating, but the correct answer is also achieved via Alan and Peter. So in that case, the correct answer is achieved via both cheating and non-cheating methods. But the question is about the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but not via cheating. So in that case, the correct answer was achieved via non-cheating, but also via cheating. So would that scenario count towards our desired probability?\n\nHmm, perhaps the question is about whether the correct answer was achieved without cheating, regardless of whether it was also achieved via cheating. So in that case, if at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly, regardless of Roger's answer, that would be a success. But wait, no, because the question says \"but not via cheating.\" So perhaps we need the correct answer to have been achieved without using Roger's cheating, i.e., without Roger being correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to think about it is: the correct answer is achieved, but it was not through Roger's cheating. So the correct answer could have been achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nSo the scenario where all three are correct would still count towards the desired probability because the correct answer was achieved via Alan and Peter. So in that case, the correct answer was achieved via non-cheating methods.\n\nBut wait, in that scenario, Roger also achieved it via cheating, but the correct answer was also achieved via non-cheating. So perhaps the event we're interested in is that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's actions. But that's not exactly what the question is asking. The question says \"but not via cheating,\" which might imply that the correct answer was achieved without any cheating involved.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not. Because if the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, that's via non-cheating, even if Roger also got it right via cheating.\n\nBut wait, that's a different interpretation. So the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating, regardless of whether it's also achieved via cheating. So in that case, the desired probability is P(A \u222a P), which is 13/15. But that's not one of the options. The options are 1/18, 1/9, 23/90, 5/18, 13/45.\n\nWait, but perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved without cheating, meaning that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So the correct answer is achieved, but it wasn't via Roger's cheating. So in other words, the correct answer was achieved by Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it right.\n\nSo that's the same as P( (A \u222a P) AND (not R) ), which we computed as 13/45. Which is option E.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by exactly one person, and that person is not Roger. So the correct answer is achieved only by Alan or only by Peter.\n\nBut that would be a different scenario. Let me compute that.\n\nThe probability that exactly Alan is correct and Roger and Peter are incorrect.\n\nP(A) * P(not R) * P(not P) = (1/5) * (1/3) * (1 - 5/6) = (1/5)*(1/3)*(1/6) = 1/(5*3*6) = 1/90.\n\nSimilarly, the probability that exactly Peter is correct and Roger and Alan are incorrect.\n\nP(not A) * P(not R) * P(P) = (4/5) * (1/3) * (5/6) = (4/5)*(1/3)*(5/6) = (4/5)*(5/18) )= (4/18) = 2/9.\n\nWait, 4/5 * 5/6 is (4*5)/(5*6) )= 4/6 = 2/3. Then multiplied by 1/3 gives (2/3)*(1/3)= 2/9.\n\nSo the total for exactly Alan and exactly Peter is 1/90 + 2/9 = (1 + 20)/90 = 21/90 = 7/30. That's approximately 0.2333.\n\nBut looking at the options, E is 13/45, which is approximately 0.2888, and option C is 23/90 \u2248 0.2555.\n\nHmm, but earlier when I considered P( (A \u222a P) AND (not R) ), I got 13/45, which is about 0.2888. But when considering the cases where exactly Alan or exactly Peter answered correctly, and R is incorrect, I got 7/30, which is 21/90, which is 7/30 \u2248 0.2333.\n\nSo which approach is correct?\n\nThe question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read the question again.\n\n\"What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?\"\n\nI think that the intended meaning is that the correct answer is achieved, but it's not through Roger's cheating. So that could include cases where both Alan and Peter got it right, and Roger didn't. Or where only Alan or only Peter got it right, and Roger didn't.\n\nSo the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and that Roger did not achieve it via cheating. So that's P( (A OR P) AND (not R) ), which is 13/45.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the correct answer being achieved through non-cheating methods (i.e., by Alan or Peter), regardless of whether Roger also achieved it via cheating. In that case, the probability would be P(A \u222a P) = 13/15. But that's not one of the options.\n\nWait, but the options given are:\n\nA)1/18\n\nB)1/9\n\nC)23/90\n\nD)5/18\n\nE)13/45\n\nSo 13/45 is option E, which is what I calculated earlier. So perhaps the intended answer is E.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Another way to approach this is to consider that the correct answer is achieved, but it's not through cheating. So the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nSo the correct answer being achieved via non-cheating is when either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is not correct. Because if Roger is correct, the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which we are to exclude.\n\nSo yes, that's the same as P( (A OR P) AND (NOT R) ) = 13/45.\n\nSo the correct answer is option E, 13/45.\n\n\nTo determine the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating, we analyze the scenarios where the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. The probabilities of each individual answering correctly are given as follows:\n\n- **Alan**: \\( P(A) = \\frac{1}{5} \\)\n- **Roger**: \\( P(R) = \\frac{2}{3} \\) (via cheating)\n- **Peter**: \\( P(P) = \\frac{5}{6} \\)\n\n### Step 1: Probability of Correct Answer via Non-Cheating\nThe correct answer is achieved via non-cheating if either Alan or Peter answers correctly. Using the formula for the union of two independent events:\n\n\\[\nP(A \\cup P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A)P(P)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\nP(A \\cup P) = \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{5}{6} - \\left(\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{5}{6}\\right)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP(A \\cup P) = \\frac{6}{30} + \\frac{25}{30} - \\frac{5}{30} = \\frac{26}{30} = \\frac{13}{15}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Probability of Roger Not Answering Correctly\nThe probability that Roger does not answer correctly is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\neg R) = 1 - P(R) = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Joint Probability of Correct Answer via Non-Cheating and Roger Not Answering\nThe joint probability that the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating (Alan or Peter answering correctly) and Roger does not answer correctly is:\n\n\\[\nP((A \\cup P) \\cap \\neg R) = P(A \\cup P) \\cdot P(\\neg R)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\nP((A \\cup P) \\cap \\neg R) = \\frac{13}{15} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{13}{45}\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{13}{45}}\n\\]\n\nAnswer: E",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question is about three friends\u2014Alan, Roger, and Peter\u2014who are answering a question on an exam. Each of them has a different probability of answering correctly, and I need to find the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating. Hmm, so that probably means Roger's cheating method isn't the reason the answer is correct. Wait, no, actually, the question says \"but not via cheating.\" So the correct answer must come from either Alan or Peter, but not Roger's cheating. Because Roger's method is cheating, so we want the cases where the correct answer comes from Alan or Peter, not from Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. The question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but the method wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved through either Alan's guessing or Peter's honest work, not Roger's cheating. Because Roger's method is cheating, which is not allowed, I think. Or wait, perhaps it's that the question is answered correctly, but it's not because of cheating. So, the correct answer is due to either Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the way to approach this is to calculate the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, but Roger didn't. Wait, no. Because the question is about the overall correctness but not via cheating. So, it's the probability that the answer is correct and it's not due to cheating (i.e., it's due to Alan or Peter). So, perhaps we can model this as the sum of the probabilities that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, minus any overlap. But wait, since each person is answering independently, the events are independent.\n\nWait, but actually, each of them is attempting the question. So the overall probability that the question is answered correctly is the probability that at least one of them answered correctly. But in this problem, we need the probability that the question is answered correctly, but it's not via cheating. So, the correct answer must have come from either Alan or Peter. So, the correct answer is either Alan correct or Peter correct, but Roger's answer is incorrect, because if Roger is correct via cheating, we don't count it.\n\nWait, no. Because the question says \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not because of cheating. So, it could be that both Alan and Roger answered correctly, but since Roger's method is cheating, we don't count that. Or perhaps, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not Roger. Or maybe, the question is correct, but the method wasn't cheating. So, perhaps it's the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, but not Roger.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think in terms of events. Let me define:\n\nA: Alan answers correctly. Probability P(A) = 1/5.\n\nR: Roger answers correctly via cheating. P(R) = 2/3.\n\nP: Peter answers correctly. P(P) =5/6.\n\nThe question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not because of Roger's cheating. So, it's the probability that the correct answer is due to either Alan or Peter.\n\nBut wait, how do we model this? Because all three are answering, so the question being answered correctly could be because any one of them got it right. But we need to exclude the cases where the correct answer came via cheating (Roger), and only include cases where the correct answer came from Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but actually, perhaps the question is that the correct answer is achieved, and the method used is not cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and Roger's method is not the reason.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is that the answer is correct, but the source is not cheating. So, the correct answer could be from Alan, Peter, or both, but not from Roger.\n\nWait, but if the question is answered correctly, it's possible that multiple people got it right. But the point is, the method used to get the correct answer isn't cheating. So, the correct answer could be from Alan, Peter, or both, but not from Roger.\n\nSo, the way to compute this is to find the probability that the question is correct, and it's because either Alan or Peter got it right. But if Roger's answer is correct, we don't count it. Or do we?\n\nWait, no. The question is about the question being answered correctly, but the answer being correct without cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is either Alan's correct guess or Peter's correct calculation. So, we need to find the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly, but Roger did not.\n\nWait, no. Because the question is answered correctly, regardless of who got it right. But we want the probability that the method used wasn't cheating, so the correct answer is from Alan or Peter. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not via Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, but what if both Alan and Roger answered correctly? Then, the question is correct, but part of it was via cheating. So, in that case, the answer being correct is due to both cheating and non-cheating. But the question is, is the answer correct via cheating or not? Hmm, perhaps we're to consider the correct answer regardless of who got it right, but whether it's via cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think of it as the probability that the correct answer is due to Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer. Because Roger's method is cheating, so if Roger got it right, it's via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nWait, but the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but the method used wasn't cheating. So, it's the probability that the question is correct, but it's not because of Roger's cheating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by someone who isn't cheating. So, it's the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, but not Roger. But since all three are answering, the overall correct answer is correct if at least one of them got it right, but we're only counting cases where it's Alan or Peter that got it right, not Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the question is answered correctly, but the way it was answered wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and Roger is not the one who got it right.\n\nWait, but the events are independent. So, the probability that the question is correct and the method wasn't cheating is the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, but Roger did not. Because if Roger answered correctly, it's via cheating, so we don't count that.\n\nAlternatively, the correct answer is achieved, and it's not via cheating. So, the probability that the question is correct is the sum of the probabilities that Alan or Peter answered correctly, but not Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the probability that the question is correct, and it's because either Alan or Peter answered correctly, regardless of whether Roger did or not.\n\nWait, no, because if Roger answered correctly, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating. So, in that case, the correct answer is via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to find the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is due to Alan or Peter, not Roger.\n\nWait, but what if both Alan and Roger are correct? Then, the correct answer is achieved, but it's via cheating as well as guessing. But the problem is, the question is correct, but we don't know who was the one to provide it. Wait, perhaps the problem is simply to find the probability that the correct answer is given, and it's due to either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger also got it right.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let's think in terms of the events:\n\nThe question is answered correctly if at least one of Alan, Roger, or Peter answered correctly. But we want the probability that the correct answer is due to either Alan or Peter, not Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but the correct answer could be achieved by both Alan and Peter, or one of them. But the key is that Roger did not contribute to the correct answer. Hmm, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger also got it right.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not through cheating. So, it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter. So, regardless of whether Roger answered correctly or not, as long as Alan or Peter got it right, the question is correct, but not via cheating.\n\nWait, but if Roger also got it right, the correct answer is achieved via both cheating and non-cheating. But the question is about the method, perhaps. Maybe the correct answer is achieved via cheating (Roger) or not (Alan or Peter). So, the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but it's not via cheating is the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, regardless of Roger.\n\nWait, but in that case, the question is correct if any of them got it right. So, the overall probability that the question is correct is 1 - probability that all three are wrong.\n\nBut the problem is not about the overall correctness, but about the correctness via non-cheating methods. So, the probability that the question is correct, but the method wasn't cheating is the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, but Roger didn't.\n\nWait, no. Because if the question is correct, but Roger's method was used, then the correct answer is via cheating. So, the correct approach is to find the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but it's not via Roger's cheating. That is, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, or by all three but the cheating method is not the one contributing.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the question is answered correctly, but the method used isn't cheating. So, the correct answer is due to Alan or Peter, not Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nSo, perhaps the formula is:\n\nP( (A correct OR P correct) AND R incorrect )\n\nBecause we want the cases where either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is not.\n\nWait, but if both Alan and Peter are correct, that's still a case where the correct answer is via non-cheating. So, the formula is correct.\n\nSo, the probability we're looking for is P(A correct OR P correct) * P(R incorrect). Wait, no, because events are independent. So, the joint probability is P(A correct OR P correct) * P(R incorrect) ?\n\nWait, no. Because the events are independent, so P(R incorrect) is (1 - P(R)) = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nBut wait, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger. So, the correct approach is to compute the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger did not.\n\nBut wait, the correct answer is achieved if any of them answered correctly. So, the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating is the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, but Roger did not. So, the formula is P( (A \u222a P) ) * P(R incorrect) ?\n\nWait, no, because the events are independent. So, the joint probability is P(A \u222a P) AND R incorrect. So, the formula is P( (A \u222a P) and not R )\n\nWhich can be written as P(A \u222a P) * P(not R) since they are independent.\n\nWait, but P(A \u222a P) is the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly. Since A and P are independent, P(A \u222a P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A)P(P).\n\nSo, let's compute that.\n\nP(A) = 1/5, P(P) = 5/6.\n\nSo, P(A \u222a P) = 1/5 + 5/6 - (1/5)(5/6) = let's compute this step by step.\n\n1/5 is 0.2, 5/6 is approximately 0.8333.\n\nAdding them: 0.2 + 0.8333 \u2248 1.0333.\n\nSubtracting the product (1/5 *5/6)= (5/30)=1/6\u22480.1667.\n\nSo, 1.0333 - 0.1667 \u2248 0.8666, which is 5/6 + 1/5 - (1/5)(5/6) = let's compute exactly.\n\nCompute 1/5 +5/6 = (6 +25)/30 = 31/30.\n\nSubtract (1/5)(5/6) = 5/30 = 1/6.\n\nSo, 31/30 - 1/6 = (31/30) - (5/30) = 26/30 = 13/15.\n\nSo, P(A \u222a P) is 13/15.\n\nThen, P(not R) = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nSince events are independent, the joint probability is P(A \u222a P) * P(not R) = (13/15) * (1/3) =13/45.\n\nWait, but that would be the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger didn't. But the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, if either Alan or Peter answered correctly, regardless of Roger, the question is correct, and it's not via cheating. But if Roger is correct, then the correct answer is via cheating. So, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nP( (A \u222a P \u222a R) ) is the probability the question is correct.\n\nBut we need P( (A \u222a P) and not R ), because if R is correct, the method is cheating, which we don't want.\n\nWait, but no. Because the question is answered correctly. So, the correct answer is achieved, but the method is not cheating. So, the correct method is either Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the correct answer is either Alan or Peter, and it doesn't matter if Roger got it right or not. Wait, no, because if Roger got it right via cheating, the correct answer is achieved via cheating, which we don't want. So, the correct scenario is that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and Roger is not the one who answered correctly. Because if Roger is correct, it's via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, the correct answer is achieved, and the method is not cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter. So, the correct answer is achieved, and the method is not cheating. So, in this case, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but we don't care whether Roger got it right or not. Because even if Roger got it right, the correct answer is via cheating, so we don't count that.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved, and the method used is not cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, but the method wasn't cheating, which implies that it's either Alan or Peter who answered correctly.\n\nBut the problem is that the question is answered correctly, but it's not via cheating. So, it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved, and the source of the correct answer is not cheating, meaning it's either Alan or Peter. So, if the correct answer is achieved via Roger (cheating), then it's excluded.\n\nWait, but how do we model this. Let's think of it as the correct answer is achieved, and the method isn't cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not via Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the formula is:\n\nP( (A \u222a P) ) * P(R incorrect) + P(R) * P( (A \u222a P) incorrect )\n\nWait, no, that might complicate. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is P( (A \u222a P) and not R ) + P( A and R and not P ) + P( P and R and not A ) ?\n\nNo, I'm getting more confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved, and it's due to Alan or Peter, not Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved via either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not. But if Roger is correct, then the method is cheating, so we don't count that scenario.\n\nWait, no. Because if the correct answer is achieved by both Alan and Roger, the correct answer is via cheating as well as guessing, but the problem is about the method. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved, and the method is not cheating, which is the case when the correct answer is due to Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the probability that the correct answer is achieved, and the method is not cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, and it's not via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger also got it right.\n\nBut wait, if the correct answer is achieved via both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer is via cheating, which we don't want. So, the correct scenario is that the correct answer is achieved, but it's not via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, and Roger is not the one who answered correctly.\n\nWait, I'm going in circles here. Let's try to model it mathematically.\n\nThe overall correct answer is achieved if at least one of Alan, Roger, or Peter answered correctly. The question is asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but it's not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, but not via Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't answer correctly.\n\nWait, no. Because if Roger answered correctly, the correct answer is achieved via cheating, which we don't want. So, the correct answer must be achieved via Alan or Peter, and Roger must not have answered correctly.\n\nSo, the formula is:\n\nP( (A \u222a P) and not R )\n\nWhich can be expanded as P(A \u222a P) * P(not R) because A, P, R are independent.\n\nWait, no, because A and P are independent of R, but A and P are not necessarily independent of each other. So, perhaps it's better to compute it as:\n\nP( (A \u222a P) ) * P(not R) = [P(A) + P(P) - P(A)P(P)] * (1 - P(R)).\n\nWe have:\n\nP(A) = 1/5, P(P) =5/6, P(R)=2/3.\n\nCompute P(A \u222a P):\n\n1/5 +5/6 - (1/5)(5/6) = (6/30 + 25/30) - (5/30) = (31/30) - (5/30) = 26/30 =13/15.\n\nThen, P(not R)=1-2/3=1/3.\n\nSo, the joint probability is (13/15) * (1/3) =13/45.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 13/45, which would be the answer. But let me double-check.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. The question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, but the method is not cheating. That is, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but in the calculation above, we have P(A \u222a P) * P(not R) = 13/15 * 1/3 =13/45. So, that's the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger did not.\n\nBut the question is about the correct answer being achieved, regardless of who got it right, but the method isn't cheating. So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but the method isn't cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but the events are independent. So, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it right.\n\nSo, the formula is (P(A) + P(P) - P(A)P(P)) * (1 - P(R)).\n\nWhich is (13/15) * (1/3) =13/45.\n\nSo, the answer would be 13/45, which is option E.\n\nBut wait, another approach: the probability that the question is correct and it's not via cheating is equal to the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the formula is P( (A correct and R incorrect) ) + P( (P correct and R incorrect) ) - P( (A and P correct and R incorrect) ).\n\nBecause if both Alan and Peter are correct, we don't want to double count.\n\nSo, let's compute that.\n\nP(A and not R) = (1/5) * (1/3) = 1/15.\n\nP(P and not R) = (5/6) * (1/3) =5/18.\n\nP(A and P and not R) = (1/5)(5/6)(1/3) = (1/5 *5/6) = 1/6 * 1/3 =1/18.\n\nSo, the total probability is (1/15 +5/18) -1/18.\n\nWait, wait. Let me compute it correctly.\n\nThe formula is P(A and not R) + P(P and not R) - P(A and P and not R).\n\nSo,\n\n1/15 +5/18 -1/18 =1/15 +4/18.\n\nSimplify 4/18 to 2/9.\n\nSo, 1/15 + 2/9 = find a common denominator, which is 45.\n\n1/15 is 3/45, 2/9 is 10/45. So, 3/45 +10/45 =13/45.\n\nSo, same result as before, 13/45.\n\nSo, the answer is E) 13/45.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability that the question is answered correctly, but the method used is not cheating.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question is about three friends\u2014Alan, Roger, and Peter\u2014who are answering a question on an exam. Each of them has a different probability of answering correctly, and I need to find the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating. Hmm, so that probably means Roger's cheating method isn't the reason the answer is correct. Wait, no, actually, the question says \"but not via cheating.\" So the correct answer must come from either Alan or Peter, but not Roger's cheating. Because Roger's method is cheating, so we want the cases where the correct answer comes from Alan or Peter, not from Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. The question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but the method wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved through either Alan's guessing or Peter's honest work, not Roger's cheating. Because Roger's method is cheating, which is not allowed, I think. Or wait, perhaps it's that the question is answered correctly, but it's not because of cheating. So, the correct answer is due to either Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the way to approach this is to calculate the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, but Roger didn't. Wait, no. Because the question is about the overall correctness but not via cheating. So, it's the probability that the answer is correct and it's not due to cheating (i.e., it's due to Alan or Peter). So, perhaps we can model this as the sum of the probabilities that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, minus any overlap. But wait, since each person is answering independently, the events are independent.\n\nWait, but actually, each of them is attempting the question. So the overall probability that the question is answered correctly is the probability that at least one of them answered correctly. But in this problem, we need the probability that the question is answered correctly, but it's not via cheating. So, the correct answer must have come from either Alan or Peter. So, the correct answer is either Alan correct or Peter correct, but Roger's answer is incorrect, because if Roger is correct via cheating, we don't count it.\n\nWait, no. Because the question says \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not because of cheating. So, it could be that both Alan and Roger answered correctly, but since Roger's method is cheating, we don't count that. Or perhaps, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not Roger. Or maybe, the question is correct, but the method wasn't cheating. So, perhaps it's the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, but not Roger.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think in terms of events. Let me define:\n\nA: Alan answers correctly. Probability P(A) = 1/5.\n\nR: Roger answers correctly via cheating. P(R) = 2/3.\n\nP: Peter answers correctly. P(P) =5/6.\n\nThe question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not because of Roger's cheating. So, it's the probability that the correct answer is due to either Alan or Peter.\n\nBut wait, how do we model this? Because all three are answering, so the question being answered correctly could be because any one of them got it right. But we need to exclude the cases where the correct answer came via cheating (Roger), and only include cases where the correct answer came from Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but actually, perhaps the question is that the correct answer is achieved, and the method used is not cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and Roger's method is not the reason.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is that the answer is correct, but the source is not cheating. So, the correct answer could be from Alan, Peter, or both, but not from Roger.\n\nWait, but if the question is answered correctly, it's possible that multiple people got it right. But the point is, the method used to get the correct answer isn't cheating. So, the correct answer could be from Alan, Peter, or both, but not from Roger.\n\nSo, the way to compute this is to find the probability that the question is correct, and it's because either Alan or Peter got it right. But if Roger's answer is correct, we don't count it. Or do we?\n\nWait, no. The question is about the question being answered correctly, but the answer being correct without cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is either Alan's correct guess or Peter's correct calculation. So, we need to find the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly, but Roger did not.\n\nWait, no. Because the question is answered correctly, regardless of who got it right. But we want the probability that the method used wasn't cheating, so the correct answer is from Alan or Peter. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not via Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, but what if both Alan and Roger answered correctly? Then, the question is correct, but part of it was via cheating. So, in that case, the answer being correct is due to both cheating and non-cheating. But the question is, is the answer correct via cheating or not? Hmm, perhaps we're to consider the correct answer regardless of who got it right, but whether it's via cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think of it as the probability that the correct answer is due to Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer. Because Roger's method is cheating, so if Roger got it right, it's via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nWait, but the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but the method used wasn't cheating. So, it's the probability that the question is correct, but it's not because of Roger's cheating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by someone who isn't cheating. So, it's the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, but not Roger. But since all three are answering, the overall correct answer is correct if at least one of them got it right, but we're only counting cases where it's Alan or Peter that got it right, not Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the question is answered correctly, but the way it was answered wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and Roger is not the one who got it right.\n\nWait, but the events are independent. So, the probability that the question is correct and the method wasn't cheating is the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, but Roger did not. Because if Roger answered correctly, it's via cheating, so we don't count that.\n\nAlternatively, the correct answer is achieved, and it's not via cheating. So, the probability that the question is correct is the sum of the probabilities that Alan or Peter answered correctly, but not Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the probability that the question is correct, and it's because either Alan or Peter answered correctly, regardless of whether Roger did or not.\n\nWait, no, because if Roger answered correctly, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating. So, in that case, the correct answer is via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to find the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is due to Alan or Peter, not Roger.\n\nWait, but what if both Alan and Roger are correct? Then, the correct answer is achieved, but it's via cheating as well as guessing. But the problem is, the question is correct, but we don't know who was the one to provide it. Wait, perhaps the problem is simply to find the probability that the correct answer is given, and it's due to either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger also got it right.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let's think in terms of the events:\n\nThe question is answered correctly if at least one of Alan, Roger, or Peter answered correctly. But we want the probability that the correct answer is due to either Alan or Peter, not Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but the correct answer could be achieved by both Alan and Peter, or one of them. But the key is that Roger did not contribute to the correct answer. Hmm, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger also got it right.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not through cheating. So, it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter. So, regardless of whether Roger answered correctly or not, as long as Alan or Peter got it right, the question is correct, but not via cheating.\n\nWait, but if Roger also got it right, the correct answer is achieved via both cheating and non-cheating. But the question is about the method, perhaps. Maybe the correct answer is achieved via cheating (Roger) or not (Alan or Peter). So, the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but it's not via cheating is the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, regardless of Roger.\n\nWait, but in that case, the question is correct if any of them got it right. So, the overall probability that the question is correct is 1 - probability that all three are wrong.\n\nBut the problem is not about the overall correctness, but about the correctness via non-cheating methods. So, the probability that the question is correct, but the method wasn't cheating is the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, but Roger didn't.\n\nWait, no. Because if the question is correct, but Roger's method was used, then the correct answer is via cheating. So, the correct approach is to find the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but it's not via Roger's cheating. That is, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, or by all three but the cheating method is not the one contributing.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the question is answered correctly, but the method used isn't cheating. So, the correct answer is due to Alan or Peter, not Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nSo, perhaps the formula is:\n\nP( (A correct OR P correct) AND R incorrect )\n\nBecause we want the cases where either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is not.\n\nWait, but if both Alan and Peter are correct, that's still a case where the correct answer is via non-cheating. So, the formula is correct.\n\nSo, the probability we're looking for is P(A correct OR P correct) * P(R incorrect). Wait, no, because events are independent. So, the joint probability is P(A correct OR P correct) * P(R incorrect) ?\n\nWait, no. Because the events are independent, so P(R incorrect) is (1 - P(R)) = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nBut wait, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger. So, the correct approach is to compute the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger did not.\n\nBut wait, the correct answer is achieved if any of them answered correctly. So, the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating is the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, but Roger did not. So, the formula is P( (A \u222a P) ) * P(R incorrect) ?\n\nWait, no, because the events are independent. So, the joint probability is P(A \u222a P) AND R incorrect. So, the formula is P( (A \u222a P) and not R )\n\nWhich can be written as P(A \u222a P) * P(not R) since they are independent.\n\nWait, but P(A \u222a P) is the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly. Since A and P are independent, P(A \u222a P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A)P(P).\n\nSo, let's compute that.\n\nP(A) = 1/5, P(P) = 5/6.\n\nSo, P(A \u222a P) = 1/5 + 5/6 - (1/5)(5/6) = let's compute this step by step.\n\n1/5 is 0.2, 5/6 is approximately 0.8333.\n\nAdding them: 0.2 + 0.8333 \u2248 1.0333.\n\nSubtracting the product (1/5 *5/6)= (5/30)=1/6\u22480.1667.\n\nSo, 1.0333 - 0.1667 \u2248 0.8666, which is 5/6 + 1/5 - (1/5)(5/6) = let's compute exactly.\n\nCompute 1/5 +5/6 = (6 +25)/30 = 31/30.\n\nSubtract (1/5)(5/6) = 5/30 = 1/6.\n\nSo, 31/30 - 1/6 = (31/30) - (5/30) = 26/30 = 13/15.\n\nSo, P(A \u222a P) is 13/15.\n\nThen, P(not R) = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nSince events are independent, the joint probability is P(A \u222a P) * P(not R) = (13/15) * (1/3) =13/45.\n\nWait, but that would be the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger didn't. But the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, if either Alan or Peter answered correctly, regardless of Roger, the question is correct, and it's not via cheating. But if Roger is correct, then the correct answer is via cheating. So, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nP( (A \u222a P \u222a R) ) is the probability the question is correct.\n\nBut we need P( (A \u222a P) and not R ), because if R is correct, the method is cheating, which we don't want.\n\nWait, but no. Because the question is answered correctly. So, the correct answer is achieved, but the method is not cheating. So, the correct method is either Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the correct answer is either Alan or Peter, and it doesn't matter if Roger got it right or not. Wait, no, because if Roger got it right via cheating, the correct answer is achieved via cheating, which we don't want. So, the correct scenario is that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and Roger is not the one who answered correctly. Because if Roger is correct, it's via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, the correct answer is achieved, and the method is not cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter. So, the correct answer is achieved, and the method is not cheating. So, in this case, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but we don't care whether Roger got it right or not. Because even if Roger got it right, the correct answer is via cheating, so we don't count that.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved, and the method used is not cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, but the method wasn't cheating, which implies that it's either Alan or Peter who answered correctly.\n\nBut the problem is that the question is answered correctly, but it's not via cheating. So, it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved, and the source of the correct answer is not cheating, meaning it's either Alan or Peter. So, if the correct answer is achieved via Roger (cheating), then it's excluded.\n\nWait, but how do we model this. Let's think of it as the correct answer is achieved, and the method isn't cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not via Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the formula is:\n\nP( (A \u222a P) ) * P(R incorrect) + P(R) * P( (A \u222a P) incorrect )\n\nWait, no, that might complicate. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is P( (A \u222a P) and not R ) + P( A and R and not P ) + P( P and R and not A ) ?\n\nNo, I'm getting more confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved, and it's due to Alan or Peter, not Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved via either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not. But if Roger is correct, then the method is cheating, so we don't count that scenario.\n\nWait, no. Because if the correct answer is achieved by both Alan and Roger, the correct answer is via cheating as well as guessing, but the problem is about the method. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved, and the method is not cheating, which is the case when the correct answer is due to Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the probability that the correct answer is achieved, and the method is not cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, and it's not via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger also got it right.\n\nBut wait, if the correct answer is achieved via both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer is via cheating, which we don't want. So, the correct scenario is that the correct answer is achieved, but it's not via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, and Roger is not the one who answered correctly.\n\nWait, I'm going in circles here. Let's try to model it mathematically.\n\nThe overall correct answer is achieved if at least one of Alan, Roger, or Peter answered correctly. The question is asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but it's not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, but not via Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't answer correctly.\n\nWait, no. Because if Roger answered correctly, the correct answer is achieved via cheating, which we don't want. So, the correct answer must be achieved via Alan or Peter, and Roger must not have answered correctly.\n\nSo, the formula is:\n\nP( (A \u222a P) and not R )\n\nWhich can be expanded as P(A \u222a P) * P(not R) because A, P, R are independent.\n\nWait, no, because A and P are independent of R, but A and P are not necessarily independent of each other. So, perhaps it's better to compute it as:\n\nP( (A \u222a P) ) * P(not R) = [P(A) + P(P) - P(A)P(P)] * (1 - P(R)).\n\nWe have:\n\nP(A) = 1/5, P(P) =5/6, P(R)=2/3.\n\nCompute P(A \u222a P):\n\n1/5 +5/6 - (1/5)(5/6) = (6/30 + 25/30) - (5/30) = (31/30) - (5/30) = 26/30 =13/15.\n\nThen, P(not R)=1-2/3=1/3.\n\nSo, the joint probability is (13/15) * (1/3) =13/45.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 13/45, which would be the answer. But let me double-check.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. The question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, but the method is not cheating. That is, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but in the calculation above, we have P(A \u222a P) * P(not R) = 13/15 * 1/3 =13/45. So, that's the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger did not.\n\nBut the question is about the correct answer being achieved, regardless of who got it right, but the method isn't cheating. So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but the method isn't cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but the events are independent. So, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it right.\n\nSo, the formula is (P(A) + P(P) - P(A)P(P)) * (1 - P(R)).\n\nWhich is (13/15) * (1/3) =13/45.\n\nSo, the answer would be 13/45, which is option E.\n\nBut wait, another approach: the probability that the question is correct and it's not via cheating is equal to the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the formula is P( (A correct and R incorrect) ) + P( (P correct and R incorrect) ) - P( (A and P correct and R incorrect) ).\n\nBecause if both Alan and Peter are correct, we don't want to double count.\n\nSo, let's compute that.\n\nP(A and not R) = (1/5) * (1/3) = 1/15.\n\nP(P and not R) = (5/6) * (1/3) =5/18.\n\nP(A and P and not R) = (1/5)(5/6)(1/3) = (1/5 *5/6) = 1/6 * 1/3 =1/18.\n\nSo, the total probability is (1/15 +5/18) -1/18.\n\nWait, wait. Let me compute it correctly.\n\nThe formula is P(A and not R) + P(P and not R) - P(A and P and not R).\n\nSo,\n\n1/15 +5/18 -1/18 =1/15 +4/18.\n\nSimplify 4/18 to 2/9.\n\nSo, 1/15 + 2/9 = find a common denominator, which is 45.\n\n1/15 is 3/45, 2/9 is 10/45. So, 3/45 +10/45 =13/45.\n\nSo, same result as before, 13/45.\n\nSo, the answer is E) 13/45.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability that the question is answered correctly, but the method used is not cheating. This means the correct answer must come from either Alan (who guesses) or Peter (who performs honest calculations), but not from Roger (who cheats). \n\n### Step 1: Define the probabilities\n- Alan answers correctly: \\( P(A) = \\frac{1}{5} \\)\n- Roger answers correctly: \\( P(R) = \\frac{2}{3} \\)\n- Peter answers correctly: \\( P(P) = \\frac{5}{6} \\)\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the probability that Alan or Peter answers correctly\nSince Alan and Peter's answers are independent, the probability that either Alan or Peter answers correctly is given by:\n\\[\nP(A \\cup P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A)P(P)\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\nP(A \\cup P) = \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{5}{6} - \\left(\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{5}{6}\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\nP(A \\cup P) = \\frac{6}{30} + \\frac{25}{30} - \\frac{5}{30} = \\frac{26}{30} = \\frac{13}{15}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the probability that Roger does not answer correctly\nThe probability that Roger does not answer correctly is:\n\\[\nP(\\text{not } R) = 1 - P(R) = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Combine the probabilities\nSince the events are independent, the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter and not by Roger is:\n\\[\nP((A \\cup P) \\text{ and not } R) = P(A \\cup P) \\cdot P(\\text{not } R)\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\nP((A \\cup P) \\text{ and not } R) = \\frac{13}{15} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{13}{45}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{13}{45}}\n\\]\n\nAnswer: E",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this probability problem here about three friends answering a question. The question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not through cheating. Hmm, I need to break this down.\n\nFirst, let me understand the scenario. There are three friends: Alan, Roger, and Peter. Each has a different way of answering and different probabilities of being correct.\n\nAlan is guessing randomly. So his probability of getting it right is 1/5. Roger is cheating by looking at someone else's paper, which gives him a 2/3 chance. Peter does the work and has a 5/6 probability of being correct.\n\nThe question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. Wait, does that mean only one of them answers correctly and it's not Roger? Or does it mean that the correct answer is achieved without Roger's cheating method?\n\nWait, perhaps the way to think about it is: the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, not Roger. Because if Roger answers correctly, that's via cheating. So we're to find the probability that either Alan or Peter got it right, but not Roger.\n\nWait no, perhaps the phrasing is that the question is answered correctly, but the method wasn't cheating. So we're looking for cases where the correct answer is from either Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't contribute. Or wait, perhaps all three could have answered, but we need to consider only the cases where the correct answer comes from non-cheating sources.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the scenario where the correct answer is obtained, but it wasn't due to cheating (i.e., Roger's method). So the correct answer could be from Alan or Peter, but not from Roger.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me read the question again: \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So it's the probability that the answer is correct, but it's not because of cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't answer correctly. Or perhaps, it's that the correct answer is achieved by at least one of them, but not through cheating. Hmm, maybe I should model all possible scenarios.\n\nWait, another approach: the question is answered correctly if at least one of them gets it right. But we want the cases where the correct answer is achieved, but it's not through cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved either by Alan or by Peter, but not by Roger. But wait, because multiple people could answer correctly. Or perhaps, the correct answer is achieved, and the method used (cheating) didn't lead to it. So, the correct answer is due to Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the events. Let me define the events:\n\nA: Alan answers correctly. P(A) = 1/5.\n\nR: Roger answers correctly. P(R) = 2/3.\n\nP: Peter answers correctly. P(P) =5/6.\n\nWe want the probability that the question is answered correctly (i.e., at least one of them got it right) but not via cheating. Wait, no, because the way the question is phrased, it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but not through cheating. So perhaps, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. Or perhaps, the correct answer is achieved, but the method wasn't cheating. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, the question might be considering that the correct answer is achieved, and the way it's achieved is not through cheating. So, it's achieved either by Alan or Peter, and not Roger. So we need to find the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. But wait, perhaps more accurately, the correct answer is given, but it's not because of Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering the case where the question is answered correctly, but the correct answer wasn't via cheating. So, the correct answer is from either Alan or Peter. So the way to compute this is to find the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, minus the cases where it's answered correctly by all three or something. Or perhaps, it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it right.\n\nWait, maybe I should model the events where the question is answered correctly (i.e., at least one of them is correct), but the correct answer is not due to cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not Roger who did it.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is to find the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, but Roger is not correct. Because if Roger is correct, then the answer was achieved via cheating. So, to have the correct answer without cheating, the answer must have been achieved by either Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it right.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right because if both Alan and Roger are correct, the answer was achieved via cheating (Roger's way). So, the correct answer could be from Roger, but we don't want that. So perhaps, the correct answer is achieved, but not via Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: the probability that the question is answered correctly (i.e., at least one of them got it right) and that Roger did not answer correctly. Because if Roger answered correctly, then the correct answer came through cheating. So, the scenario where the correct answer is achieved but not via cheating is when at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger did not.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is phrased, perhaps the question is answered correctly, and the method used wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer comes from Alan or Peter, but not Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but Roger didn't get it.\n\nSo, to compute this, we can find the probability that (Alan is correct OR Peter is correct) AND Roger is incorrect. Because if Roger is incorrect, then the correct answer must have come from Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but wait: the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not through cheating. So, the correct answer could have been achieved by either Alan or Peter. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved, and the method wasn't cheating, which implies that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's result. Wait, but that can't be, because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which we are to exclude.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. Alternatively, the correct answer is achieved without Roger's help.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer is via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nSo, the probability we're looking for is P(A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR. Because we want the correct answer to be achieved (so at least one of A, R, P is correct) but not via cheating (so R is incorrect).\n\nWait, no. Because if R is correct, then the correct answer came via cheating, which we don't want. So the correct answer must come from A or P, and R must not be correct. So the scenario is that the correct answer is achieved by A or P, and R is not correct.\n\nWait, but in that case, the correct answer is achieved via A or P, but R is not correct. So, the correct answer is achieved, but not via cheating, which is what we want.\n\nSo, the probability is the probability that (A \u2228 P) is correct, and R is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, it's the probability that the question is answered correctly (so at least one of A, R, P is correct) and that R is incorrect. Because if R is incorrect, then the correct answer must have come from A or P.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again: the correct answer could be achieved by A, P, or both, but R is not contributing. So the correct answer is achieved without R's cheating.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to compute the probability that at least one of A or P is correct, and R is incorrect.\n\nSo, mathematically, P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR )\n\nBut let me compute this.\n\nFirst, compute P(R is incorrect). Since R is correct with probability 2/3, incorrect is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nThen, compute the probability that either A or P is correct, given that R is incorrect.\n\nWait, no, because R's result is independent of A and P.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to compute P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P(\u00acR) * P(A \u2228 P | \u00acR)\n\nBut since A and P are independent of R, perhaps I can compute it as P(\u00acR) * [1 - P(\u00acA \u2227 \u00acP) ]\n\nWait, because P(A \u2228 P) = 1 - P(\u00acA) * P(\u00acP), since A and P are independent.\n\nSo, let me compute P(A \u2228 P) = 1 - (1 - 1/5) * (1 - 5/6) = 1 - (4/5)*(1/6) = 1 - (4/30) = 1 - 2/15 = 13/15.\n\nSo, the probability that A or P is correct is 13/15.\n\nNow, the probability that R is incorrect is 1/3.\n\nSo, the joint probability that R is incorrect AND (A or P is correct) is (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/45.\n\nWait, but wait. Is that correct? Because the events are independent, so P(A \u2228 P) is 13/15, and P(\u00acR) is 1/3, so the joint is 13/15 * 1/3 = 13/45. So that's option E, which is 13/45.\n\nBut wait, let me check. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either A or P, but not by R. So, the correct answer comes from A or P, and R is not correct.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is phrased is \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved, and it's not via cheating, which would mean that the correct answer came from A or P, and R is not correct.\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved by A or P, and R is not correct. So, the formula is P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR), since the events are independent.\n\nWait, but are A, P, and R independent? The problem doesn't state any dependence, so I'll assume they are independent.\n\nSo, P(A \u2228 P) is 13/15, as calculated earlier.\n\nP(\u00acR) is 1/3.\n\nSo, P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/45.\n\nSo the answer would be 13/45, which is option E.\n\nWait, but wait another thought: the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, and the method used is not cheating. So, it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved, and the correct answer wasn't via cheating.\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved (so at least one is correct), but the correct answer was not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by A or P, but not by R.\n\nBut wait, if R is correct, then the correct answer is via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by A or P, and R is incorrect.\n\nSo, the correct formula is P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR) = (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/45.\n\nSo the answer is E) 13/45.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. Because another approach could be to calculate the probability that the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating methods, which would be the sum of the probabilities that only Alan is correct, only Peter is correct, and both are correct, while Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, so that would be:\n\nP( (A \u2227 \u00acR \u2227 \u00acP) ) + P( (\u00acA \u2227 R \u2227 P) ) + P( (A \u2227 P \u2227 \u00acR) )\n\nWait, no, because we're only considering cases where the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating. Wait, no, the correct answer is achieved, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer could be via Alan, via Peter, or via both, but not via Roger.\n\nSo, the correct scenario is that the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't answer correctly.\n\nSo, perhaps the formula is P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR )\n\nWhich, as before, is (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/45.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not via Roger.\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved either by Alan, Peter, or both, but not via Roger.\n\nSo, the probability would be the probability that the question is answered correctly, but Roger is not the one who answered correctly.\n\nWait, but the question is about the method. So, perhaps it's better to model it as the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nSo, the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and Roger is not correct.\n\nWhich is the same as P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR) = (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/45.\n\nSo, that's option E.\n\nWait, but another approach: the probability that the question is answered correctly without cheating is the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger didn't. Because if Roger did, it's via cheating.\n\nSo, the calculation would be:\n\nP( (A \u2228 P) ) * P(\u00acR) = (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/45.\n\nWhich is option E.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is E) 13/45.\n",

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, the question might be considering that the correct answer is achieved, and the way it's achieved is not through cheating. So, it's achieved either by Alan or Peter, and not Roger. So we need to find the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. But wait, perhaps more accurately, the correct answer is given, but it's not because of Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering the case where the question is answered correctly, but the correct answer wasn't via cheating. So, the correct answer is from either Alan or Peter. So the way to compute this is to find the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, minus the cases where it's answered correctly by all three or something. Or perhaps, it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it right.\n\nWait, maybe I should model the events where the question is answered correctly (i.e., at least one of them is correct), but the correct answer is not due to cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not Roger who did it.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is to find the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, but Roger is not correct. Because if Roger is correct, then the answer was achieved via cheating. So, to have the correct answer without cheating, the answer must have been achieved by either Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it right.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right because if both Alan and Roger are correct, the answer was achieved via cheating (Roger's way). So, the correct answer could be from Roger, but we don't want that. So perhaps, the correct answer is achieved, but not via Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: the probability that the question is answered correctly (i.e., at least one of them got it right) and that Roger did not answer correctly. Because if Roger answered correctly, then the correct answer came through cheating. So, the scenario where the correct answer is achieved but not via cheating is when at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger did not.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is phrased, perhaps the question is answered correctly, and the method used wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer comes from Alan or Peter, but not Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but Roger didn't get it.\n\nSo, to compute this, we can find the probability that (Alan is correct OR Peter is correct) AND Roger is incorrect. Because if Roger is incorrect, then the correct answer must have come from Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but wait: the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not through cheating. So, the correct answer could have been achieved by either Alan or Peter. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved, and the method wasn't cheating, which implies that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's result. Wait, but that can't be, because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which we are to exclude.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. Alternatively, the correct answer is achieved without Roger's help.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer is via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nSo, the probability we're looking for is P(A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR. Because we want the correct answer to be achieved (so at least one of A, R, P is correct) but not via cheating (so R is incorrect).\n\nWait, no. Because if R is correct, then the correct answer came via cheating, which we don't want. So the correct answer must come from A or P, and R must not be correct. So the scenario is that the correct answer is achieved by A or P, and R is not correct.\n\nWait, but in that case, the correct answer is achieved via A or P, but R is not correct. So, the correct answer is achieved, but not via cheating, which is what we want.\n\nSo, the probability is the probability that (A \u2228 P) is correct, and R is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, it's the probability that the question is answered correctly (so at least one of A, R, P is correct) and that R is incorrect. Because if R is incorrect, then the correct answer must have come from A or P.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again: the correct answer could be achieved by A, P, or both, but R is not contributing. So the correct answer is achieved without R's cheating.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to compute the probability that at least one of A or P is correct, and R is incorrect.\n\nSo, mathematically, P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR )\n\nBut let me compute this.\n\nFirst, compute P(R is incorrect). Since R is correct with probability 2/3, incorrect is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nThen, compute the probability that either A or P is correct, given that R is incorrect.\n\nWait, no, because R's result is independent of A and P.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to compute P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P(\u00acR) * P(A \u2228 P | \u00acR)\n\nBut since A and P are independent of R, perhaps I can compute it as P(\u00acR) * [1 - P(\u00acA \u2227 \u00acP) ]\n\nWait, because P(A \u2228 P) = 1 - P(\u00acA) * P(\u00acP), since A and P are independent.\n\nSo, let me compute P(A \u2228 P) = 1 - (1 - 1/5) * (1 - 5/6) = 1 - (4/5)*(1/6) = 1 - (4/30) = 1 - 2/15 = 13/15.\n\nSo, the probability that A or P is correct is 13/15.\n\nNow, the probability that R is incorrect is 1/3.\n\nSo, the joint probability that R is incorrect AND (A or P is correct) is (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/45.\n\nWait, but wait. Is that correct? Because the events are independent, so P(A \u2228 P) is 13/15, and P(\u00acR) is 1/3, so the joint is 13/15 * 1/3 = 13/45. So that's option E, which is 13/45.\n\nBut wait, let me check. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either A or P, but not by R. So, the correct answer comes from A or P, and R is not correct.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is phrased is \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved, and it's not via cheating, which would mean that the correct answer came from A or P, and R is not correct.\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved by A or P, and R is not correct. So, the formula is P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR), since the events are independent.\n\nWait, but are A, P, and R independent? The problem doesn't state any dependence, so I'll assume they are independent.\n\nSo, P(A \u2228 P) is 13/15, as calculated earlier.\n\nP(\u00acR) is 1/3.\n\nSo, P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/45.\n\nSo the answer would be 13/45, which is option E.\n\nWait, but wait another thought: the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, and the method used is not cheating. So, it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved, and the correct answer wasn't via cheating.\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved (so at least one is correct), but the correct answer was not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by A or P, but not by R.\n\nBut wait, if R is correct, then the correct answer is via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by A or P, and R is incorrect.\n\nSo, the correct formula is P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR) = (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/45.\n\nSo the answer is E) 13/45.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. Because another approach could be to calculate the probability that the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating methods, which would be the sum of the probabilities that only Alan is correct, only Peter is correct, and both are correct, while Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, so that would be:\n\nP( (A \u2227 \u00acR \u2227 \u00acP) ) + P( (\u00acA \u2227 R \u2227 P) ) + P( (A \u2227 P \u2227 \u00acR) )\n\nWait, no, because we're only considering cases where the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating. Wait, no, the correct answer is achieved, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer could be via Alan, via Peter, or via both, but not via Roger.\n\nSo, the correct scenario is that the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't answer correctly.\n\nSo, perhaps the formula is P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR )\n\nWhich, as before, is (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/45.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not via Roger.\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved either by Alan, Peter, or both, but not via Roger.\n\nSo, the probability would be the probability that the question is answered correctly, but Roger is not the one who answered correctly.\n\nWait, but the question is about the method. So, perhaps it's better to model it as the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nSo, the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and Roger is not correct.\n\nWhich is the same as P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR) = (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/45.\n\nSo, that's option E.\n\nWait, but another approach: the probability that the question is answered correctly without cheating is the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger didn't. Because if Roger did, it's via cheating.\n\nSo, the calculation would be:\n\nP( (A \u2228 P) ) * P(\u00acR) = (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/45.\n\nWhich is option E.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is E) 13/45.\n\n\nTo determine the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating, we analyze the contributions of Alan, Roger, and Peter. The key is to calculate the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, while Roger does not answer correctly.\n\n### Step 1: Define probabilities\n- **Alan** answers correctly with probability \\( P(A) = \\frac{1}{5} \\).\n- **Roger** answers correctly with probability \\( P(R) = \\frac{2}{3} \\), and incorrectly with \\( P(\\neg R) = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n- **Peter** answers correctly with probability \\( P(P) = \\frac{5}{6} \\).\n\n### Step 2: Probability that Alan or Peter answers correctly\nThe probability that either Alan or Peter answers correctly is given by:\n\\[\nP(A \\cup P) = 1 - P(\\neg A) \\cdot P(\\neg P)\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\nP(A \\cup P) = 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{5}\\right) \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{5}{6}\\right) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\nP(A \\cup P) = 1 - \\frac{4}{30} = 1 - \\frac{2}{15} = \\frac{13}{15}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating\nWe need the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter **and** Roger does not answer correctly. Since the events are independent, this is:\n\\[\nP((A \\cup P) \\cap \\neg R) = P(A \\cup P) \\cdot P(\\neg R)\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\nP((A \\cup P) \\cap \\neg R) = \\frac{13}{15} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{13}{45}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating is \\( \\frac{13}{45} \\).\n\nAnswer: E",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.\n\nAlright, the setup is about three friends: Alan, Roger, and Peter. Each of them has a different way of answering a question on an exam, and each has their own probability of getting it right. The question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. Hmm, so I need to find the probability that at least one of them answers correctly, but not because of Roger's cheating. Or wait, maybe it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved without cheating. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question says, \"What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?\" Oh, wait, maybe it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not Roger. Because if Roger answers correctly, that's via cheating, and we don't want that. So, the correct answer is achieved, but not through Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the probability that exactly one of them answers correctly, and that it's either Alan or Peter. Wait, no, the wording isn't about exactly one, just that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, if either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of the others, but Roger's correctness isn't considered. Or maybe the correct answer is achieved, but not through cheating, so we're looking for the probability that someone other than Roger got it right.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem states that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved without cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer was given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether the others got it right or not.\n\nSo, how to model this. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, each person has their own probability of being correct:\n\n- Alan: 1/5\n- Roger: 2/3 (but he's cheating, so we don't want his correct answer)\n- Peter: 5/6\n\nWe need the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. That means the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter. But wait, what if both Alan and Peter answer correctly? Or perhaps the question is that the correct answer is achieved, regardless of how many people got it right, but it's not via cheating. So, in other words, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger does. So, the question is, what's the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter answers correctly, but Roger doesn't.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the question is that the correct answer is achieved by someone who isn't cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not necessarily excluding the possibility that Roger also got it right. Wait, no, because if Roger gets it right, that's via cheating, so the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, perhaps the event is that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger does. So, the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating methods.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the question is that the correct answer is achieved by someone, but it wasn't through cheating. So, we have to consider that the correct answer was achieved by either Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it through cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved without cheating, which would be if either Alan or Peter is correct, but Roger is not.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but the method used was not cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved via either Alan or Peter, and Roger's answer is incorrect.\n\nWait, but if the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, it could be that only Alan got it right, only Peter got it right, or both. But Roger must have gotten it wrong.\n\nSo, the event we are interested in is: (Alan correct OR Peter correct) AND Roger incorrect.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that the question is answered correctly. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by at least one of them, but not via cheating. So, if either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect, then the question was answered correctly via non-cheating methods.\n\nWait, but that's not entirely accurate. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating. So, the event that the question is correctly answered without cheating is the case where either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect. Because if Roger is correct, the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nSo, the event we want is (Alan correct OR Peter correct) AND Roger incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly via non-cheating methods, which would be the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it. Because if Roger got it, then that's via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nWait, but the way the question is phrased, it's the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved, and the correct answer was achieved by someone who isn't cheating. So, the event is that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, no. Let me think of it in terms of all possibilities.\n\nThe total possible scenarios are:\n\n1. All three answer correctly.\n2. Alan and Roger correct, Peter wrong.\n3. Alan and Peter correct, Roger wrong.\n4. Roger and Peter correct, Alan wrong.\n5. Only Alan correct.\n6. Only Roger correct.\n7. Only Peter correct.\n8. All wrong.\n\nWe are to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, in which of these scenarios is the correct answer achieved via non-cheating? That would be scenarios where the correct answer is achieved without Roger's cheating. So, any scenario where the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not? Or no, because if Roger is correct, that's via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is considered to be achieved via cheating if Roger is correct. So, the correct answer could be achieved via non-cheating even if Roger is correct, but that's not the case. Because if Roger is correct, that's via cheating, so the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which is what we don't want.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer was achieved via non-cheating if and only if the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter. But wait, the correct answer might be given by multiple people. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating if at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nWait, but that's not right. Because even if Roger is correct, the correct answer could also have been achieved by Alan or Peter, but the point is, we want the correct answer to have been achieved without cheating, which would be if the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger does. But no, because if Roger is correct, then that's via cheating, so the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nSo, perhaps the event is that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and not achieved by Roger. Because if Roger achieved it, that's via cheating, so we don't want that scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is that the correct answer is achieved, but not through Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not. But wait, that can't be because if Roger is correct, that's via cheating, so the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nSo, I think the correct way is that the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating if either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect. Because if Roger is correct, that's via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nWait, but if the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, that would mean that the correct answer was given by someone who isn't cheating, i.e., either Alan or Peter. But if Roger is correct, that's via cheating, so the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which we don't want. So, we need the correct answer to be achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger does. Wait, but that can't be, because if Roger is correct, the correct answer was achieved via cheating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by someone who didn't cheat, regardless of whether others cheated. So, the event is that the correct answer is achieved by at least one of Alan or Peter, and regardless of Roger. But no, because if Roger is correct, the correct answer was achieved via cheating, so the overall correct answer's method includes cheating, which we don't want.\n\nI think I'm getting stuck here. Let me approach it differently. Let's model the problem as: the correct answer is given by the correct method (non-cheating) if either Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger didn't answer correctly.\n\nWait, no, because the question is whether the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating if it's given by Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger does. But that's not correct, because if Roger's answer is correct, that's via cheating, so the correct answer is achieved via cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating if it's given by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct. Because the correct answer could be given by multiple people, but as long as at least one of them is Alan or Peter, and the correct answer is achieved without cheating. But that's not necessarily the case. Because if the correct answer was achieved by both Alan and Roger, then it was achieved via cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply that the correct answer is achieved by someone who is not cheating, regardless of whether others are cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not via Roger. So, the event is that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, no. Because the question is about the correct answer being achieved, but not via cheating. So, if the correct answer is achieved by any of them, but not through cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, but Roger is not. Because if Roger is correct, that's via cheating, so the correct answer is achieved via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nSo, the event we want is (Alan correct OR Peter correct) AND Roger incorrect.\n\nSo, to compute this probability, we can use the formula:\n\nP = P(A or P correct) * P(Roger incorrect)\n\nWait, no. Because Alan and Peter's correctness are independent events, and Roger's correctness is independent.\n\nSo, the event is (A correct OR P correct) AND R incorrect.\n\nWhich can be written as [1 - P(not A and not P)] * (1 - P(R correct)).\n\nWait, let's compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct is P(A correct OR P correct) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A and P).\n\nBecause A and P are independent, since their actions don't affect each other. So,\n\nP(A or P) = (1/5) + (5/6) - (1/5)(5/6) = (6/30 + 25/30) - (5/30) ) = (31/30) - (5/30) ) = 26/30 = 13/15.\n\nBut wait, that's the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of what Roger does.\n\nBut we also need to ensure that Roger is incorrect. Because if Roger is correct, the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nSo, the overall event is (A correct OR P correct) AND R incorrect.\n\nSince A, P, R are independent, we can compute this as:\n\nP(A or P) * P(R incorrect) = [13/15] * [1 - 2/3] = (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/45.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Because the event is that (A correct OR P correct) AND R incorrect. So, that's the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo, the calculation is (P(A correct OR P correct)) * P(R incorrect).\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in calculating P(A correct OR P correct). Let me re-calculate that.\n\nP(A correct) = 1/5 = 0.2\n\nP(P correct) = 5/6 \u2248 0.8333.\n\nSince A and P are independent, P(A and P) = (1/5)*(5/6) = 1/6.\n\nSo, P(A OR P) = 1/5 + 5/6 - 1/6 = (6/30 + 25/30 -5/30) = (26/30) = 13/15.\n\nSo, that part is correct.\n\nThen, P(R incorrect) = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nSo, the combined probability is (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/45.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 13/45. So, the answer would be E.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Because I'm not sure if the event is correctly modeled.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by someone else, either Alan or Peter. But if both Alan and Peter are correct, then the correct answer was achieved without cheating.\n\nSo, the probability that the question is answered correctly via non-cheating methods is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo, another way to compute it is:\n\nProbability = [1 - P(neither Alan nor Peter correct)] * P(Roger incorrect).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because the event is that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that either Alan is correct or Peter is correct, but Roger is incorrect.\n\nWhich is P(A correct OR P correct) * P(R incorrect).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because A and P's correctness are independent of R's. So, perhaps the correct way is to calculate:\n\nP( (A correct OR P correct) AND R incorrect )\n\nWhich is equal to P(A correct OR P correct) * P(R incorrect), since R is independent.\n\nWait, no, because A and P's correctness are independent of R's. So, yes, the events are independent.\n\nWait, no, that's not the case. Because the events A, P, and R are independent, so the joint probability is the product of individual probabilities.\n\nWait, let's think again. The correct way is to compute P( (A correct OR P correct) AND R incorrect ).\n\nWhich can be expanded as P(A correct OR P correct) * P(R incorrect) since R is independent of A and P.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because (A correct OR P correct) is not necessarily independent of R's correctness. Wait, no, because A, P, and R are all independent. So, the correctness of A and P doesn't affect R's correctness, and vice versa.\n\nSo, the probability of (A correct OR P correct) AND (R incorrect) is equal to [P(A correct OR P correct)] * [P(R incorrect)].\n\nSo, P(A correct OR P correct) is 13/15, as calculated earlier.\n\nP(R incorrect) is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nSo, 13/15 * 1/3 = 13/45. So, the probability is 13/45, which is option E.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because if Alan and Peter are correct, and Roger is incorrect, that contributes to the event. But what if both Alan and Peter are incorrect, but Roger is correct? That would be via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nWait, but the event we are interested in is the correct answer being achieved without cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not via Roger.\n\nSo, another approach: the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating if either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not. But wait, no, because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me model all possible cases where the correct answer is achieved without cheating.\n\nThe correct answer is achieved via non-cheating if either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo, the probability is:\n\nP = P(A correct OR P correct) * P(R incorrect)\n\nBut wait, no. Because (A correct OR P correct) and (R incorrect) are independent? Yes, because A, P, and R are independent.\n\nSo, the probability is [P(A correct) + P(P correct) - P(A correct)P(P correct)] * [1 - P(R correct)].\n\nWhich is [ (1/5) + (5/6) - (1/5)(5/6) ] * (1/3).\n\nCalculating the terms:\n\n1/5 = 6/30, 5/6 = 25/30.\n\nSo, 6/30 +25/30 =31/30.\n\nMinus (1/5)(5/6)= 5/30.\n\nSo, 31/30 -5/30=26/30=13/15.\n\nMultiply by 1/3: (13/15)(1/3) =13/45.\n\nSo, the answer is E)13/45.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.\n\nAlright, the setup is about three friends: Alan, Roger, and Peter. Each of them has a different way of answering a question on an exam, and each has their own probability of getting it right. The question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. Hmm, so I need to find the probability that at least one of them answers correctly, but not because of Roger's cheating. Or wait, maybe it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved without cheating. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question says, \"What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?\" Oh, wait, maybe it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not Roger. Because if Roger answers correctly, that's via cheating, and we don't want that. So, the correct answer is achieved, but not through Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the probability that exactly one of them answers correctly, and that it's either Alan or Peter. Wait, no, the wording isn't about exactly one, just that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, if either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of the others, but Roger's correctness isn't considered. Or maybe the correct answer is achieved, but not through cheating, so we're looking for the probability that someone other than Roger got it right.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem states that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved without cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer was given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether the others got it right or not.\n\nSo, how to model this. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, each person has their own probability of being correct:\n\n- Alan: 1/5\n- Roger: 2/3 (but he's cheating, so we don't want his correct answer)\n- Peter: 5/6\n\nWe need the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. That means the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter. But wait, what if both Alan and Peter answer correctly? Or perhaps the question is that the correct answer is achieved, regardless of how many people got it right, but it's not via cheating. So, in other words, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger does. So, the question is, what's the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter answers correctly, but Roger doesn't.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the question is that the correct answer is achieved by someone who isn't cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not necessarily excluding the possibility that Roger also got it right. Wait, no, because if Roger gets it right, that's via cheating, so the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, perhaps the event is that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger does. So, the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating methods.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the question is that the correct answer is achieved by someone, but it wasn't through cheating. So, we have to consider that the correct answer was achieved by either Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it through cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved without cheating, which would be if either Alan or Peter is correct, but Roger is not.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but the method used was not cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved via either Alan or Peter, and Roger's answer is incorrect.\n\nWait, but if the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, it could be that only Alan got it right, only Peter got it right, or both. But Roger must have gotten it wrong.\n\nSo, the event we are interested in is: (Alan correct OR Peter correct) AND Roger incorrect.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that the question is answered correctly. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by at least one of them, but not via cheating. So, if either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect, then the question was answered correctly via non-cheating methods.\n\nWait, but that's not entirely accurate. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating. So, the event that the question is correctly answered without cheating is the case where either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect. Because if Roger is correct, the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nSo, the event we want is (Alan correct OR Peter correct) AND Roger incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly via non-cheating methods, which would be the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it. Because if Roger got it, then that's via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nWait, but the way the question is phrased, it's the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved, and the correct answer was achieved by someone who isn't cheating. So, the event is that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, no. Let me think of it in terms of all possibilities.\n\nThe total possible scenarios are:\n\n1. All three answer correctly.\n2. Alan and Roger correct, Peter wrong.\n3. Alan and Peter correct, Roger wrong.\n4. Roger and Peter correct, Alan wrong.\n5. Only Alan correct.\n6. Only Roger correct.\n7. Only Peter correct.\n8. All wrong.\n\nWe are to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, in which of these scenarios is the correct answer achieved via non-cheating? That would be scenarios where the correct answer is achieved without Roger's cheating. So, any scenario where the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not? Or no, because if Roger is correct, that's via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is considered to be achieved via cheating if Roger is correct. So, the correct answer could be achieved via non-cheating even if Roger is correct, but that's not the case. Because if Roger is correct, that's via cheating, so the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which is what we don't want.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer was achieved via non-cheating if and only if the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter. But wait, the correct answer might be given by multiple people. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating if at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nWait, but that's not right. Because even if Roger is correct, the correct answer could also have been achieved by Alan or Peter, but the point is, we want the correct answer to have been achieved without cheating, which would be if the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger does. But no, because if Roger is correct, then that's via cheating, so the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nSo, perhaps the event is that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and not achieved by Roger. Because if Roger achieved it, that's via cheating, so we don't want that scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is that the correct answer is achieved, but not through Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not. But wait, that can't be because if Roger is correct, that's via cheating, so the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nSo, I think the correct way is that the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating if either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect. Because if Roger is correct, that's via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nWait, but if the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, that would mean that the correct answer was given by someone who isn't cheating, i.e., either Alan or Peter. But if Roger is correct, that's via cheating, so the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which we don't want. So, we need the correct answer to be achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger does. Wait, but that can't be, because if Roger is correct, the correct answer was achieved via cheating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by someone who didn't cheat, regardless of whether others cheated. So, the event is that the correct answer is achieved by at least one of Alan or Peter, and regardless of Roger. But no, because if Roger is correct, the correct answer was achieved via cheating, so the overall correct answer's method includes cheating, which we don't want.\n\nI think I'm getting stuck here. Let me approach it differently. Let's model the problem as: the correct answer is given by the correct method (non-cheating) if either Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger didn't answer correctly.\n\nWait, no, because the question is whether the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating if it's given by Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger does. But that's not correct, because if Roger's answer is correct, that's via cheating, so the correct answer is achieved via cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating if it's given by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct. Because the correct answer could be given by multiple people, but as long as at least one of them is Alan or Peter, and the correct answer is achieved without cheating. But that's not necessarily the case. Because if the correct answer was achieved by both Alan and Roger, then it was achieved via cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply that the correct answer is achieved by someone who is not cheating, regardless of whether others are cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not via Roger. So, the event is that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, no. Because the question is about the correct answer being achieved, but not via cheating. So, if the correct answer is achieved by any of them, but not through cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, but Roger is not. Because if Roger is correct, that's via cheating, so the correct answer is achieved via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nSo, the event we want is (Alan correct OR Peter correct) AND Roger incorrect.\n\nSo, to compute this probability, we can use the formula:\n\nP = P(A or P correct) * P(Roger incorrect)\n\nWait, no. Because Alan and Peter's correctness are independent events, and Roger's correctness is independent.\n\nSo, the event is (A correct OR P correct) AND R incorrect.\n\nWhich can be written as [1 - P(not A and not P)] * (1 - P(R correct)).\n\nWait, let's compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct is P(A correct OR P correct) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A and P).\n\nBecause A and P are independent, since their actions don't affect each other. So,\n\nP(A or P) = (1/5) + (5/6) - (1/5)(5/6) = (6/30 + 25/30) - (5/30) ) = (31/30) - (5/30) ) = 26/30 = 13/15.\n\nBut wait, that's the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of what Roger does.\n\nBut we also need to ensure that Roger is incorrect. Because if Roger is correct, the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nSo, the overall event is (A correct OR P correct) AND R incorrect.\n\nSince A, P, R are independent, we can compute this as:\n\nP(A or P) * P(R incorrect) = [13/15] * [1 - 2/3] = (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/45.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Because the event is that (A correct OR P correct) AND R incorrect. So, that's the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo, the calculation is (P(A correct OR P correct)) * P(R incorrect).\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in calculating P(A correct OR P correct). Let me re-calculate that.\n\nP(A correct) = 1/5 = 0.2\n\nP(P correct) = 5/6 \u2248 0.8333.\n\nSince A and P are independent, P(A and P) = (1/5)*(5/6) = 1/6.\n\nSo, P(A OR P) = 1/5 + 5/6 - 1/6 = (6/30 + 25/30 -5/30) = (26/30) = 13/15.\n\nSo, that part is correct.\n\nThen, P(R incorrect) = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nSo, the combined probability is (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/45.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 13/45. So, the answer would be E.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Because I'm not sure if the event is correctly modeled.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by someone else, either Alan or Peter. But if both Alan and Peter are correct, then the correct answer was achieved without cheating.\n\nSo, the probability that the question is answered correctly via non-cheating methods is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo, another way to compute it is:\n\nProbability = [1 - P(neither Alan nor Peter correct)] * P(Roger incorrect).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because the event is that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that either Alan is correct or Peter is correct, but Roger is incorrect.\n\nWhich is P(A correct OR P correct) * P(R incorrect).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because A and P's correctness are independent of R's. So, perhaps the correct way is to calculate:\n\nP( (A correct OR P correct) AND R incorrect )\n\nWhich is equal to P(A correct OR P correct) * P(R incorrect), since R is independent.\n\nWait, no, because A and P's correctness are independent of R's. So, yes, the events are independent.\n\nWait, no, that's not the case. Because the events A, P, and R are independent, so the joint probability is the product of individual probabilities.\n\nWait, let's think again. The correct way is to compute P( (A correct OR P correct) AND R incorrect ).\n\nWhich can be expanded as P(A correct OR P correct) * P(R incorrect) since R is independent of A and P.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because (A correct OR P correct) is not necessarily independent of R's correctness. Wait, no, because A, P, and R are all independent. So, the correctness of A and P doesn't affect R's correctness, and vice versa.\n\nSo, the probability of (A correct OR P correct) AND (R incorrect) is equal to [P(A correct OR P correct)] * [P(R incorrect)].\n\nSo, P(A correct OR P correct) is 13/15, as calculated earlier.\n\nP(R incorrect) is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nSo, 13/15 * 1/3 = 13/45. So, the probability is 13/45, which is option E.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because if Alan and Peter are correct, and Roger is incorrect, that contributes to the event. But what if both Alan and Peter are incorrect, but Roger is correct? That would be via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nWait, but the event we are interested in is the correct answer being achieved without cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not via Roger.\n\nSo, another approach: the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating if either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not. But wait, no, because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me model all possible cases where the correct answer is achieved without cheating.\n\nThe correct answer is achieved via non-cheating if either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo, the probability is:\n\nP = P(A correct OR P correct) * P(R incorrect)\n\nBut wait, no. Because (A correct OR P correct) and (R incorrect) are independent? Yes, because A, P, and R are independent.\n\nSo, the probability is [P(A correct) + P(P correct) - P(A correct)P(P correct)] * [1 - P(R correct)].\n\nWhich is [ (1/5) + (5/6) - (1/5)(5/6) ] * (1/3).\n\nCalculating the terms:\n\n1/5 = 6/30, 5/6 = 25/30.\n\nSo, 6/30 +25/30 =31/30.\n\nMinus (1/5)(5/6)= 5/30.\n\nSo, 31/30 -5/30=26/30=13/15.\n\nMultiply by 1/3: (13/15)(1/3) =13/45.\n\nSo, the answer is E)13/45.\n\n\nTo determine the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating, we analyze the given probabilities for each friend:\n\n- **Alan** has a probability of \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) of answering correctly.\n- **Roger** has a probability of \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) of answering correctly (via cheating).\n- **Peter** has a probability of \\( \\frac{5}{6} \\) of answering correctly.\n\nThe question specifies that the correct answer is achieved **not via cheating**, meaning we are interested in scenarios where the correct answer is provided by either Alan or Peter, but not Roger. This requires two conditions:\n1. At least one of Alan or Peter answers correctly.\n2. Roger does not answer correctly.\n\n### Step 1: Probability that at least one of Alan or Peter answers correctly\nThe probability that Alan answers correctly is \\( P(A) = \\frac{1}{5} \\), and the probability that Peter answers correctly is \\( P(P) = \\frac{5}{6} \\). Since their actions are independent, the probability that both answer incorrectly is:\n\\[\nP(\\text{neither Alan nor Peter correct}) = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{5}\\right) \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{5}{6}\\right) = \\frac{4}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{4}{30}.\n\\]\nThus, the probability that at least one of them answers correctly is:\n\\[\nP(A \\text{ or } P) = 1 - P(\\text{neither correct}) = 1 - \\frac{4}{30} = \\frac{26}{30} = \\frac{13}{15}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Probability that Roger does not answer correctly\nThe probability that Roger answers incorrectly is:\n\\[\nP(R \\text{ incorrect}) = 1 - P(R \\text{ correct}) = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Combined probability\nThe probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating is the product of the two probabilities above, since the events are independent:\n\\[\nP(\\text{correct but not via cheating}) = P(A \\text{ or } P) \\cdot P(R \\text{ incorrect}) = \\frac{13}{15} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{13}{45}.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating is \\( \\frac{13}{45} \\).\n\nAnswer: E",
