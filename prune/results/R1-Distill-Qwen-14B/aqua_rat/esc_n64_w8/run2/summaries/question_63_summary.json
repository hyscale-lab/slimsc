      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the maximum distance I can travel with $8.50 in a cab. The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and then 10 cents for each additional quarter mile. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how much money I have left after the initial charge. The total I have is $8.50, and the first quarter mile costs $3.50. So subtracting that, $8.50 minus $3.50 would be $5.00 left. Oh wait, right, because 3.50 plus 5 is 8.50. So that part makes sense.\n\nNow, the remaining $5 is going to be spent on each additional quarter mile, which costs 10 cents each. So I need to find out how many quarter miles I can get with $5. Let me think about that. Each quarter mile is $0.10, so the number of quarter miles would be $5 divided by $0.10 per quarter mile. Let me calculate that: 5 / 0.10 equals 50. So that's 50 quarter miles.\n\nWait, but wait a second. So the first quarter mile is included in the initial $3.50. Then, each additional quarter mile adds 10 cents. So the total distance would be the first quarter mile plus 50 more quarter miles. So how many total quarter miles is that? It's 1 plus 50, which is 51 quarter miles.\n\nBut wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The initial charge is for the first quarter mile, and each additional is 10 cents. So if I have 50 additional quarter miles, that's 50 * 0.25 miles. Plus the initial 0.25 miles. So the total would be (50 +1) * 0.25 miles.\n\nWait, no, no. Wait, the first quarter mile is 1, and each additional is 50. So total is 51 quarter miles. So 51 * 0.25 miles. Let me compute that. 0.25 times 51. Well, 0.25 is a quarter, so 50 * 0.25 is 12.5, and 1 *0.25 is 0.25. So 12.5 + 0.25 is 12.75 miles. So that's 12.75 miles total.\n\nWait, but let me check the options. Option B is 12.75. So that should be the answer, right?\n\nWait, but wait again. Let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. So initial fare: $3.50. That covers the first 0.25 miles. Remaining money: $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00. Each additional quarter mile is $0.10. So how many can I get with $5? $5 / $0.10 = 50. So that's 50 quarter miles. So total quarter miles is 1 +50=51. 51 * 0.25 = 12.75 miles.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the answer should be B)12.75 miles.\n",

Adding the initial quarter mile, the total number of quarter miles is 1 + 50 = 51 quarter miles. Converting to miles, the total distance is 51 * 0.25 = 12.75 miles.\n\nThus, the maximum distance you can travel is **12.75 miles**, which corresponds to option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the maximum distance I can travel with $8.50 in a cab. The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and then 10 cents for each additional quarter mile. Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nWait, first I need to figure out how much money I have and how it's being spent. I have $8.50. The initial charge is $3.50 for the first quarter mile. So, that leaves me with 8.50 minus 3.50, which is 5.00 dollars left. Right, so $5.00 for the additional distance.\n\nEach additional quarter mile costs 10 cents. Oh wait, 10 cents is $0.10. So I need to find out how many quarter miles I can get with $5.00. Let me think about that. So, $5.00 divided by $0.10 per quarter mile equals how many?\n\nLet me calculate that: 5.00 / 0.10 = 50. So that's 50 quarter miles. Wait, each quarter mile is 0.25 miles. So 50 times 0.25 miles is 12.5 miles. Oh, but wait, that's just the additional distance after the first quarter mile. \n\nSo the first part is 0.25 miles, and then 50 times 0.25 is 12.5 miles. So total distance is 0.25 + 12.5 = 12.75 miles. Let me check the options. Option B is 12.75, so that's probably the answer.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I consider all the charges correctly? The initial charge is $3.50 for the first quarter mile. Then each additional quarter mile is 10 cents. So each extra 0.25 miles adds $0.10. So with $5 left, I can get 50 of these. 50 * 0.25 is 12.5. Adding the initial 0.25 gives 12.75. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nSo the maximum distance is 12.75 miles. Looking at the options again, option B is 12.75. So the answer should be B.\n\n\nTo calculate the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50, start by subtracting the initial charge of $3.50 for the first quarter mile.

But wait, $5 is in dollars and the charge is in cents, so maybe I should convert dollars to cents to avoid confusion. $5.00 is 500 cents. Each quarter-mile is 10 cents, so dividing 500 by 10 gives me 50. That means I can go 50 additional quarter-miles.\n\nWait, so the first part is 1 quarter-mile, and then 50 more. So the total number of quarter-miles is 1 + 50 = 51. To get the total distance, I multiply the number of quarter-miles by 0.25. So 51 * 0.25 equals... 12.75 miles. \n\nWait, let me check that math again. 51 times 0.25. Oh right, because each quarter is 0.25 miles. So 50 * 0.25 is 12.5, and adding the first quarter gives 12.75. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is 12.75 miles. So the answer should be B. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Did I account for all the money correctly? The initial $3.50 is spent, and then each 10 cents is for a quarter-mile. $5 gives 50 quarter-miles, so 50 * 0.25 is 12.5, plus the initial 0.25 makes 12.75. Yep, that seems right.\n\n\nTo determine the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 in a cab that charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter-mile, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Subtract the initial charge**: The first quarter-mile costs $3.50. Subtracting this from the total amount gives:  \n   \\[\n   \\$8.50 - \\$3.50 = \\$5.00\n   \\]  \n   This leaves $5.00 for additional distance.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of additional quarter-miles**: Each additional quarter-mile costs 10 cents. Convert $5.00 to cents:  \n   \\[\n   \\$5.00 = 500 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]  \n   Divide by the cost per quarter-mile:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{500 \\text{ cents}}{10 \\text{ cents/quarter-mile}} = 50 \\text{ quarter-miles}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the total distance**: The total number of quarter-miles is the initial quarter-mile plus the additional 50 quarter-miles:  \n   \\[\n   1 + 50 = 51 \\text{ quarter-miles}\n   \\]  \n   Convert quarter-miles to miles:  \n   \\[\n   51 \\times 0.25 = 12.75 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the maximum distance you can travel is **12.75 miles**, which corresponds to option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",
