      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this marble problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again.\n\nSo, the setup is: there's a bag with only white marbles initially. Then, 20 marbles are pulled out, painted black, and put back into the bag. After that, another 20 marbles are pulled out, and among those, 1 was black. Then they're all returned to the bag. The question is, if the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles are in the bag currently (Q)?\n\nHmm, okay. So, let's break it down. Let's think about what's happening step by step.\n\nFirst, the bag has only white marbles. Let's say the total number of marbles in the bag is Q. Then, 20 white marbles are taken out, painted black, and returned. So now, the bag has Q marbles, 20 of which are black, and the rest are white. So after the first step, the bag has 20 black marbles and (Q - 20) white marbles.\n\nThen, in the second step, 20 marbles are drawn again. Out of these 20, 1 is black. So the proportion of black marbles in the second draw is 1/20, which is 5%. The problem states that this percentage represents their percentage in the bag. So the percentage of black marbles in the bag should be 5%.\n\nWait, so the percentage of black marbles is 5% after the second draw. But wait, after the first draw, the bag has 20 black marbles. So the total number of marbles in the bag is still Q, right? Because we added the 20 black marbles back in. So after the first step, the composition is 20 black and (Q) total marbles, which is 20/Q as the fraction of black marbles.\n\nThen, the second draw: 20 marbles are pulled out, and 1 is black. So the proportion of black marbles in the bag is such that when you take out 20 marbles, 1 is black. So the proportion of black marbles in the bag is 1/20, which is 5%. So 5% of the total marbles in the bag are black.\n\nWait, but the number of black marbles in the bag is 20, right? Because we only painted 20 white marbles black and put them back. So if 20 is 5% of the total, then we can find the total Q.\n\nSo 20 is 5% of Q. So 5% is the same as 0.05. So 0.05 * Q = 20. So Q = 20 / 0.05. Let me calculate that: 20 divided by 0.05 is 400. So Q would be 400 marbles.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Because when you pull out 20 marbles, the probability of getting a black marble is based on the proportion in the bag. So the proportion is 20/Q, right? So when you draw 20 marbles, the expected number of black marbles would be 20*(20/Q) = 400/Q *20. Wait, no, wait: the expected number is (number of black marbles in the bag) multiplied by (number drawn) divided by total marbles.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. The expected number is (proportion of black marbles) multiplied by the number drawn. So proportion is 20/Q. So the expected number of black marbles in the sample of 20 is (20/Q) *20.\n\nBut in the problem, when they drew 20 marbles, they found 1 black marble. So that's 1 out of 20, which is 5%. The problem says this represents the percentage in the bag. So the percentage in the bag is 5%, so 20/Q = 0.05. So solving for Q: Q = 20 / 0.05 = 400. So the total number of marbles in the bag is 400.\n\nSo looking at the options, option D is 400. So the answer should be D)400.\n\nWait, but let me check if I got that right. Because sometimes when you replace marbles, the total can change, but in this case, after each draw, the marbles are returned. So the total number of marbles in the bag remains the same throughout.\n\nAnother way: after adding 20 black marbles, the bag has 20 black marbles. The second draw of 20 marbles yielded 1 black. So the proportion is 1/20, which is 5%. So 5% of the total marbles are black. So 5% of Q is 20. Because the 20 black marbles are 5% of the total. So 0.05 * Q = 20. So Q=20/0.05=400.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the answer is D)400.\n",

So the total number of marbles in the bag is the same as before and after. Wait, no\u2014wait, actually, the problem doesn't specify the initial total. Oh, right, because when they pulled out 20, painted them, and put them back, the total number of marbles would have increased by 20? Or wait, no\u2014because if you take 20 out, paint them, and put them back, the total number of marbles remains the same as before. Oh wait, no.

So the percentage of black marbles in the bag is equal to 5% because in the sample, 5% were black. So the actual percentage of black marbles is 5%. \n\nSo, the number of black marbles is 5% of Q. But wait, how many black marbles are there in the bag? We added 20 black marbles after the first step. So the total number of black marbles is 20. So 20 marbles is 5% of the total Q. \n\nWait, that's the key equation. Because 20 is 5% of Q. So, 20 = 0.05 * Q.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about marbles, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nSo, the setup is: There's a bag of white marbles. 20 marbles are pulled out, painted black, and then put back into the bag. Then, another 20 marbles are pulled out, and 1 of them is black. They return all to the bag. The question says that the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag. We need to find the total number of marbles Q in the bag.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, initially, the bag has only white marbles. Let's denote the total number of marbles in the bag as Q. So initially, all Q marbles are white.\n\nThen, 20 marbles are taken out, painted black, and returned. So now, the bag has Q marbles again, but 20 of them are black, and the rest (Q - 20) are white.\n\nNext, another 20 marbles are pulled out. Out of these, 1 is black. The problem states that the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag. So, the ratio of black marbles in the sample pulled out (which is 1 out of 20) should be equal to the ratio of black marbles in the entire bag.\n\nWait, so the percentage of black marbles in the bag after the first step is (20/Q) * 100%, right? Because there are 20 black marbles out of Q total.\n\nWhen they pulled out 20 marbles the second time, 1 was black. So the proportion of black marbles in that sample is 1/20. The problem says this is equal to the proportion in the bag. So,\n\n(1/20) = (20/Q)\n\nSo, I can set up that equation. Let me write that:\n\n1/20 = 20/Q\n\nHmm, solving for Q. Cross-multiplying gives:\n\n1 * Q = 20 * 20\nQ = 400\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I set that up correctly? So, the proportion in the sample is 1/20, which equals the proportion in the bag, which is 20/Q. So yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, solving that equation, Q would be 400. Looking at the options, D is 400. So the answer should be D.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Because sometimes when you're dealing with these proportions, the way you calculate it can be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think in terms of expected number of black marbles in the second draw. So, the probability of drawing a black marble the second time is equal to the proportion of black marbles in the bag. So, when we drew 20 marbles, the expected number of black marbles is 20 * (20/Q). And in reality, we observed 1 black marble.\n\nSo, 20 * (20/Q) = 1\n\nWhich again gives 400/Q = 1/20, wait no, wait let's calculate:\n\n20 * (20/Q) = 1\n\n=> (400)/Q = 1\n\n=> Q = 400.\n\nSame result. So that confirms it.\n\nWait another thing: The total number after putting back the 20 black marbles is the same as before, right? So the initial Q is the same as after adding the 20 black marbles. Because you took 20 out, painted them, then put them back. So the total remains Q.\n\nThen, when you draw the second 20, the total is still Q. So the proportion is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 400 marbles. So the correct option is D.\n",

In the second draw, the proportion of black marbles in the sample is \\( \\frac{1}{20} \\). Since these proportions are equal, we set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{20} = \\frac{20}{Q}.\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\n\\[\nQ = 20 \\times 20 = 400.\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of marbles in the bag is \\( Q = 400 \\).\n\nAnswer: D",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about marbles, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nSo, the setup is: There's a bag of white marbles. 20 marbles are pulled out, painted black, and then put back into the bag. Then, another 20 marbles are pulled out, and 1 of them is black. They return all to the bag. The question says that the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag. We need to find the total number of marbles Q in the bag.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, initially, the bag has only white marbles. Let's denote the total number of marbles in the bag as Q. So initially, all Q marbles are white.\n\nThen, 20 marbles are taken out, painted black, and returned. So now, the bag has Q marbles again, but 20 of them are black, and the rest (Q - 20) are white.\n\nNext, another 20 marbles are pulled out. Out of these, 1 is black. The problem states that the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag. So, the ratio of black marbles in the sample pulled out (which is 1 out of 20) should be equal to the ratio of black marbles in the entire bag.\n\nWait, so the percentage of black marbles in the bag after the first step is (20/Q) * 100%, right? Because there are 20 black marbles out of Q total.\n\nWhen they pulled out 20 marbles the second time, 1 was black. So the proportion of black marbles in that sample is 1/20. The problem says this is equal to the proportion in the bag. So,\n\n(1/20) = (20/Q)\n\nSo, I can set up that equation. Let me write that:\n\n1/20 = 20/Q\n\nHmm, solving for Q. Cross-multiplying gives:\n\n1 * Q = 20 * 20\nQ = 400\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I set that up correctly? So, the proportion in the sample is 1/20, which equals the proportion in the bag, which is 20/Q. So yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, solving that equation, Q would be 400. Looking at the options, D is 400. So the answer should be D.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Because sometimes when you're dealing with these proportions, the way you calculate it can be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think in terms of expected number of black marbles in the second draw. So, the probability of drawing a black marble the second time is equal to the proportion of black marbles in the bag. So, when we drew 20 marbles, the expected number of black marbles is 20 * (20/Q). And in reality, we observed 1 black marble.\n\nSo, 20 * (20/Q) = 1\n\nWhich again gives 400/Q = 1/20, wait no, wait let's calculate:\n\n20 * (20/Q) = 1\n\n=> (400)/Q = 1\n\n=> Q = 400.\n\nSame result. So that confirms it.\n\nWait another thing: The total number after putting back the 20 black marbles is the same as before, right? So the initial Q is the same as after adding the 20 black marbles. Because you took 20 out, painted them, then put them back. So the total remains Q.\n\nThen, when you draw the second 20, the total is still Q. So the proportion is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 400 marbles. So the correct option is D.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the total number of marbles, \\( Q \\), in a bag after two steps. Initially, the bag contains only white marbles. In the first step, 20 white marbles are pulled out, painted black, and returned to the bag, making 20 black marbles in the bag. In the second step, 20 marbles are drawn again, and 1 of them is black. The problem states that the percentage of black marbles pulled out in the second draw represents their percentage in the bag.\n\nThe proportion of black marbles in the bag after the first step is \\( \\frac{20}{Q} \\). In the second draw, the proportion of black marbles in the sample is \\( \\frac{1}{20} \\). Since these proportions are equal, we set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{20} = \\frac{20}{Q}.\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\n\\[\nQ = 20 \\times 20 = 400.\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of marbles in the bag is \\( Q = 400 \\).\n\nAnswer: D",

The clue given is that the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag. So, the percentage of black marbles in the bag is the same as the percentage in the second draw.\n\nWait, let me think again. So after the first step, the bag has a certain number of marbles. Let's call the total number of marbles Q. Initially, all are white. Then, 20 are taken out, painted black, and put back.

So, the proportion of black marbles in the bag is 20/Q. Because we added 20 black marbles, right?\n\nIn the second draw, we pulled 20 marbles, and 1 was black. So the proportion of black marbles in that draw is 1/20 = 5%. So, the percentage of black marbles in the bag is 5%.\n\nWait, no. Because the percentage in the bag would be (20/Q) * 100. And the percentage in the second draw is (1/20)*100 = 5%. So setting them equal:\n\n(20/Q) * 100 = 5\n\nSo solving for Q:\n\n2000 / Q = 5 \u2192 Q = 2000 /5 \u2192 Q=400.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.

No, because after the first step, the total remains Q, and all marbles are returned after the second draw.

The proportion in the second draw is 1/20. So, 20/Q = 1/20.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Because the percentage in the draw (1/20) equals the percentage in the bag (20/Q).

That makes sense because if the draw is representative, the proportion in the sample should match the proportion in the entire bag.\n\nLet me think about the setup. Initially, all marbles are white. Then 20 are painted black and returned. So the total number of marbles in the bag after the first step is still the same as before, unless the initial number is given. Wait, the initial number isn't given directly. Hmm, maybe I can call the initial total number of marbles as T. Then after adding 20 black marbles, the total is still T because we took 20 out, painted, and put them back. Wait no, wait. Wait, no. The initial step is that 20 are taken out, painted, and put back.

Because we added 20 black marbles. Oh wait, no. Because when you take marbles out, paint them, and put them back, the total number of marbles remains the same, but the number of black marbles increases by 20. Wait, no: the initial bag had only white marbles. So, after the first step, the bag has 20 black marbles and the rest white. So the total number of marbles is still Q, which is the same as before because we took 20 out and put them back. So Q is the same as the initial number.\n\nWait, but no. Let me think again. Suppose the bag initially had N marbles. Then, 20 were taken out, painted, and put back. So now, the bag has N marbles, 20 of which are black. Then, in the second draw, 20 marbles are taken out, and 1 is black. So the proportion of black marbles in the bag is 20/N. \n\nBut according to the problem, the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time (which is 1/20, or 5%) is equal to the actual percentage in the bag. So 20/N = 1/20. Because 20 is the number of black marbles, and N is the total.\n\nWait, wait. Let me be precise. The percentage in the bag is (number of black marbles) / (total marbles) * 100%. The percentage pulled in the second draw is (number of black pulled) / (total pulled) *100%. \n\nSo, according to the problem, (number of black pulled in second draw) / (20) = (number of black marbles in bag) / (total marbles in bag). \n\nIn the second draw, 1 black was pulled out of 20. So 1/20 equals the proportion of black marbles in the bag. \n\nBut the number of black marbles in the bag is 20 (since we added 20). So 20 / N = 1/20, where N is the total marbles. \n\nSolving for N: 20 / N = 1/20 => N = 20 * 20 = 400. So the total marbles in the bag is 400. \n\nWait, but let me check. If the bag has 400 marbles, 20 are black. So the proportion is 20/400 = 1/20, which is 5%. When you take 20 marbles, the expected number of black marbles is 5% of 20, which is 1. So yes, the percentage pulled in the second draw matches the actual percentage.\n\nSo the answer should be 400 marbles. Looking at the options, D is 400.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about marbles in a bag, and I need to figure out the total number of marbles in the bag after some operations. Hmm, let me read it again and break it down step by step.\n\nSo, the process is: first, 20 marbles are pulled out from a bag that originally has only white marbles. These 20 are painted black and then put back into the bag. So now, the bag has 20 black marbles and the rest white. \n\nThen, another 20 marbles are pulled out. Out of these, 1 is black. After this second draw, all the marbles are returned to the bag. The question says that the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag. I need to find the total number of marbles in the bag, which they're calling Q.\n\nWait, so the percentage of black marbles in the second draw reflects their actual percentage in the bag. That makes sense because if the draw is representative, the proportion in the sample should match the proportion in the entire bag.\n\nLet me think about the setup. Initially, all marbles are white. Then 20 are painted black and returned. So the total number of marbles in the bag after the first step is still the same as before, unless the initial number is given. Wait, the initial number isn't given directly. Hmm, maybe I can call the initial total number of marbles as T. Then after adding 20 black marbles, the total is still T because we took 20 out, painted, and put them back. Wait no, wait. Wait, no. The initial step is that 20 are taken out, painted, and put back. So the initial number of marbles in the bag is Q, because the question is asking for Q. Wait, no. Let me re-express:\n\nWait, the problem says \"the bag currently holds.\" So the initial state is the bag has some marbles, all white. Then, 20 are pulled out, painted black, and put back. So the bag now has 20 black marbles and the rest white. Then, in the second draw, 20 marbles are pulled, and 1 is black. So the proportion of black marbles in the second draw is 1/20, which is 5%. \n\nThe problem states that this percentage represents the actual percentage of black marbles in the bag. So the percentage of black marbles in the bag is 5%. Therefore, the number of black marbles in the bag is 5% of the total Q.\n\nBut wait, the number of black marbles is 20, right? Because we added 20 black marbles. Oh wait, no. Because when you take marbles out, paint them, and put them back, the total number of marbles remains the same, but the number of black marbles increases by 20. Wait, no: the initial bag had only white marbles. So, after the first step, the bag has 20 black marbles and the rest white. So the total number of marbles is still Q, which is the same as before because we took 20 out and put them back. So Q is the same as the initial number.\n\nWait, but no. Let me think again. Suppose the bag initially had N marbles. Then, 20 were taken out, painted, and put back. So now, the bag has N marbles, 20 of which are black. Then, in the second draw, 20 marbles are taken out, and 1 is black. So the proportion of black marbles in the bag is 20/N. \n\nBut according to the problem, the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time (which is 1/20, or 5%) is equal to the actual percentage in the bag. So 20/N = 1/20. Because 20 is the number of black marbles, and N is the total.\n\nWait, wait. Let me be precise. The percentage in the bag is (number of black marbles) / (total marbles) * 100%. The percentage pulled in the second draw is (number of black pulled) / (total pulled) *100%. \n\nSo, according to the problem, (number of black pulled in second draw) / (20) = (number of black marbles in bag) / (total marbles in bag). \n\nIn the second draw, 1 black was pulled out of 20. So 1/20 equals the proportion of black marbles in the bag. \n\nBut the number of black marbles in the bag is 20 (since we added 20). So 20 / N = 1/20, where N is the total marbles. \n\nSolving for N: 20 / N = 1/20 => N = 20 * 20 = 400. So the total marbles in the bag is 400. \n\nWait, but let me check. If the bag has 400 marbles, 20 are black. So the proportion is 20/400 = 1/20, which is 5%. When you take 20 marbles, the expected number of black marbles is 5% of 20, which is 1. So yes, the percentage pulled in the second draw matches the actual percentage.\n\nSo the answer should be 400 marbles.

I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it slow.\n\nSo, the problem says that there's a bag with only white marbles initially. Then, 20 marbles are taken out, painted black, and put back into the bag. So after this first step, the bag has some black marbles. Wait, but how many? Because they took out 20 white marbles, painted them black, and returned them. So the total number of marbles in the bag must be the same as before, right? Because they took out 20 and put them back. But wait, maybe the initial count was different? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nWait, the problem doesn't say the initial number of marbles. Oh wait, the question is about finding the total marbles Q in the bag after all this. So, the initial count isn't given, but we'll have to figure it out using the data provided.\n\nSo, after the first step, there are 20 black marbles in the bag. Because 20 white ones were painted black and returned.\n\nThen, the second step: another 20 marbles are pulled out. Of those, 1 is black. So, they pulled out 20 marbles, 1 black, 19 white. Then, they returned all of them to the bag.\n\nNow, the problem states that the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag. Hmm. So the proportion of black marbles in the sample pulled out (which is 1 out of 20) should be equal to the proportion in the entire bag.\n\nWait, so when they pulled out 20 marbles the second time, 1 was black. So the proportion is 1/20, which is 5%. So that must be equal to the proportion of black marbles in the entire bag.\n\nSo, the proportion of black marbles in the bag is 5%. But how many marbles are in the bag?\n\nWait, after the first step, the bag has 20 black marbles. Let me denote the total number of marbles in the bag as Q.\n\nSo, the proportion of black marbles is 20 / Q. Because there are 20 black marbles out of Q total.\n\nBut from the second pull, the proportion is 1/20, which equals 5%. So 1/20 is 0.05, or 5%. So 20 / Q must equal 0.05.\n\nWait, yes. Because the proportion in the bag is 20 / Q, which is equal to 1/20. So 20/Q = 1/20.\n\nLet me solve that equation. Multiply both sides by Q: 20 = Q/20. Then multiply both sides by 20: Q = 20 * 20 = 400.\n\nWait, so the total number of marbles in the bag is 400. So the answer should be D)400.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.

Then, 20 were painted black and returned, so the total is the same as before. So the initial total was Q, then after adding the 20 black marbles, it's still Q. Because they were taken out and put back.\n\nWait, no. Wait, initially, the bag had some number of marbles. Let's say the initial number was N. Then, they took 20 white marbles, painted them black, and put them back. So the number of marbles in the bag is N + 20? Or no, because they took out 20 white marbles and returned them as black. So the total remains N. Because you take out 20, paint them, and put them back. So the total count doesn't change.\n\nAh, wait, no. Because when you take out 20 marbles, you have N marbles in the bag. Then you remove 20, so N-20. Then you add 20 black marbles. So the total is (N-20) + 20 = N. So yes, the total remains N.\n\nSo after the first step, the bag has N marbles, of which 20 are black. Then, in the second step, 20 marbles are pulled out, and 1 is black. So the proportion of black marbles is 1/20, which is 5%, and this equals the proportion in the bag (20 / N).\n\nSo 20 / N = 1/20 \u2192 N = 400. So the total marbles in the bag is 400, which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me see. The second time, 20 marbles are pulled, 1 is black. So the proportion is 5% in the sample. So the bag must have 5% black marbles.\n\nIn the bag, there are 20 black marbles. So 20 is 5% of the total marbles. So 5% of Q is 20.

Let's see, the problem goes like this: There's a bag of only white marbles. Then, 20 marbles are pulled out, painted black, and put back in. After that, another 20 marbles are pulled out, and among those, 1 was black. The question is about finding the total number of marbles in the bag, which they're calling Q.\n\nWait, the key point here is that the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag. Oh right, so the proportion of black marbles in the sample pulled the second time should be the same as the proportion in the entire bag.\n\nLet me break it down step by step. Initially, all marbles are white. Then, 20 are painted black and returned. So after the first step, the bag has some black marbles and the rest white. Let me think about how many total marbles there are. Oh, wait, the problem doesn't state the initial number. Hmm, but after adding 20 black marbles, the total would be Q = initial number plus 20. Wait, but wait, the initial number could be anything, but perhaps the process is such that the number doesn't matter because we're dealing with proportions.\n\nWait, maybe the initial number is Q, and then we add 20, making the new total Q + 20? Or wait, wait. No, because when you pull out 20 marbles, paint them, and put them back, the total number of marbles remains the same. Oh wait, no, because you're pulling out 20, painting them, and putting them back. So the total number of marbles doesn't change. Wait, no, because you're just repainting them, so the total remains the same as before. So if the initial number was Q, after painting and returning, it's still Q marbles in the bag.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Let's say the bag initially has Q marbles, all white. Then, 20 are pulled out, painted black, and put back. So now, those 20 are black marbles. So the bag now has (Q - 20) white marbles and 20 black marbles. Wait, no, because you pulled out 20 white marbles, painted them black, and put them back. So the total number is still Q marbles. So the composition is Q marbles: (Q - 20) white marbles and 20 black marbles. Because you took out 20 white, made them black, and returned them.\n\nThen, the second time, 20 marbles are pulled out, and 1 is black. So the proportion of black marbles in that sample is 1/20, which is 5%.\n\nThe problem states that this percentage represents their percentage in the bag. So the percentage of black marbles in the bag is 5%. So 5% of the total marbles in the bag are black.\n\nWait, but how many black marbles are there in the bag after the first step? 20, right? Because we painted 20 white marbles black and put them back.\n\nWait no, because the initial number was Q marbles, all white. So when you take out 20 white marbles, paint them black, and put them back, you have Q marbles again, but now 20 are black and (Q - 20) are white.\n\nWait, no, because the 20 you took out were white. So you painted them black and returned them. So the total number of marbles is Q, but now 20 are black, and the rest are white. So the proportion of black marbles in the bag is 20/Q.\n\nBut when we took the second sample of 20 marbles, 1 was black. So the proportion in the sample is 1/20 = 5%. The problem says that this represents the proportion in the bag. So 20/Q = 5% or 0.05.\n\nWait, wait, 20 is the number of black marbles in the bag. So the proportion is 20/Q = 0.05.\n\nSo solving for Q: 20 = 0.05 * Q \u2192 Q = 20 / 0.05 = 400.\n\nSo the total number of marbles in the bag is 400. Looking at the options, D is 400. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So the process: Initially, Q marbles, all white. 20 pulled, painted black, so now 20 black marbles. The total marbles remain Q. So the proportion of black marbles is 20/Q. When we take 20 marbles out, the expected number of black marbles is (20/Q) * 20 = (400)/Q. Wait, no, the proportion is (20/Q) so in a sample of 20, the expected number is 20*(20/Q) = 400/Q. But in the problem, it's given that exactly 1 was black. So 400/Q = 1 \u2192 Q = 400.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the total number is 400 marbles.\n",

Let's see, the problem goes like this: There's a bag of only white marbles. Then, 20 marbles are pulled out, painted black, and put back in. After that, another 20 marbles are pulled out, and among those, 1 was black. The question is about finding the total number of marbles in the bag, which they're calling Q.\n\nWait, the key point here is that the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag. Oh right, so the proportion of black marbles in the sample pulled the second time should be the same as the proportion in the entire bag.\n\nLet me break it down step by step. Initially, all marbles are white. Then, 20 are painted black and returned. So after the first step, the bag has some black marbles and the rest white. Let me think about how many total marbles there are. Oh, wait, the problem doesn't state the initial number. Hmm, but after adding 20 black marbles, the total would be Q = initial number plus 20. Wait, but wait, the initial number could be anything, but perhaps the process is such that the number doesn't matter because we're dealing with proportions.\n\nWait, maybe the initial number is Q, and then we add 20, making the new total Q + 20? Or wait, wait. No, because when you pull out 20 marbles, paint them, and put them back, the total number of marbles remains the same. Oh wait, no, because you're pulling out 20, painting them, and putting them back. So the total number of marbles doesn't change. Wait, no, because you're just repainting them, so the total remains the same as before. So if the initial number was Q, after painting and returning, it's still Q marbles in the bag.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Let's say the bag initially has Q marbles, all white. Then, 20 are pulled out, painted black, and put back. So now, those 20 are black marbles. So the bag now has (Q - 20) white marbles and 20 black marbles. Wait, no, because you pulled out 20 white marbles, painted them black, and put them back. So the total number is still Q marbles. So the composition is Q marbles: (Q - 20) white marbles and 20 black marbles. Because you took out 20 white, made them black, and returned them.\n\nThen, the second time, 20 marbles are pulled out, and 1 is black. So the proportion of black marbles in that sample is 1/20, which is 5%.\n\nThe problem states that this percentage represents their percentage in the bag. So the percentage of black marbles in the bag is 5%. So 5% of the total marbles in the bag are black.\n\nWait, but how many black marbles are there in the bag after the first step? 20, right? Because we painted 20 white marbles black and put them back.\n\nWait no, because the initial number was Q marbles, all white. So when you take out 20 white marbles, paint them black, and put them back, you have Q marbles again, but now 20 are black and (Q - 20) are white.\n\nWait, no, because the 20 you took out were white. So you painted them black and returned them. So the total number of marbles is Q, but now 20 are black, and the rest are white. So the proportion of black marbles in the bag is 20/Q.\n\nBut when we took the second sample of 20 marbles, 1 was black. So the proportion in the sample is 1/20 = 5%. The problem says that this represents the proportion in the bag. So 20/Q = 5% or 0.05.\n\nWait, wait, 20 is the number of black marbles in the bag. So the proportion is 20/Q = 0.05.\n\nSo solving for Q: 20 = 0.05 * Q \u2192 Q = 20 / 0.05 = 400.\n\nSo the total number of marbles in the bag is 400. Looking at the options, D is 400. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So the process: Initially, Q marbles, all white. 20 pulled, painted black, so now 20 black marbles. The total marbles remain Q. So the proportion of black marbles is 20/Q. When we take 20 marbles out, the expected number of black marbles is (20/Q) * 20 = (400)/Q. Wait, no, the proportion is (20/Q) so in a sample of 20, the expected number is 20*(20/Q) = 400/Q. But in the problem, it's given that exactly 1 was black. So 400/Q = 1 \u2192 Q = 400.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the total number is 400 marbles.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the total number of marbles, \\( Q \\), in a bag after a series of steps. Initially, all marbles are white. Then, 20 marbles are pulled out, painted black, and returned to the bag. At this point, the bag contains 20 black marbles and \\( Q - 20 \\) white marbles, for a total of \\( Q \\) marbles. \n\nNext, another 20 marbles are pulled out, and 1 of them is black. The problem states that the percentage of black marbles in this second sample represents their percentage in the entire bag. This means the proportion of black marbles in the bag is equal to the proportion of black marbles in the second sample.\n\nThe proportion of black marbles in the bag is given by \\( \\frac{20}{Q} \\), since there are 20 black marbles out of \\( Q \\) total marbles. The proportion of black marbles in the second sample is \\( \\frac{1}{20} = 0.05 \\) (or 5%). Setting these equal:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{20}{Q} = 0.05\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( Q \\):\n\n\\[\nQ = \\frac{20}{0.05} = 400\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of marbles in the bag is \\( Q = 400 \\). Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: D",
