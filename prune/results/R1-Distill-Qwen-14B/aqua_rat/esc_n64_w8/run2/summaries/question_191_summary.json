      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars. Let me see how I can approach this.\n\nThe problem says that one soda and two energy bars cost 150 cents. Then, two sodas and three energy bars cost 300 cents. Hmm, wait, that seems a bit odd. Because if I just double the first option, one soda and two bars would be 150, so two sodas and four bars would be 300. But the second option is two sodas and three bars for 300. So that's actually cheaper than the doubled first option. That suggests that maybe the price isn't linear, or perhaps there's a discount. But wait, the problem states that the costs do not change, so I think I can set up a system of equations to solve for the individual prices of a soda and an energy bar.\n\nLet me denote the cost of one soda as S cents and one energy bar as B cents. So, the first statement gives me the equation: S + 2B = 150. The second statement gives me 2S + 3B = 300.\n\nNow I have two equations:\n\n1. S + 2B = 150\n2. 2S + 3B = 300\n\nI need to solve these two equations to find S and B. Let me see the best way to do that. Maybe substitution or elimination. Let's try elimination.\n\nIf I multiply the first equation by 2, it becomes 2S + 4B = 300. Now, I can subtract the second equation from this new equation. So:\n\n(2S +4B) - (2S +3B) = 300 - 300\nWhich simplifies to:\n2S +4B -2S -3B = 0\nSo that leaves B = 0.\n\nWait, B equals zero? That can't be right. Energy bars are free? That doesn't make sense. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nLet me double-check. The first equation multiplied by 2 is 2S +4B = 300. The second equation is 2S +3B = 300. Subtracting them: (2S+4B)-(2S+3B) = 300 - 300. That gives 0S + B = 0. So B=0. Hmm, that's what I got. But that would imply that energy bars are free, which is strange. But perhaps that's the case according to the given prices.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I plug B=0 into the first equation, S + 0 = 150. So S would be 150. Then, checking the second equation: 2*150 + 3*0 = 300. Which is correct. So according to the given data, energy bars are free and sodas cost 150 cents each.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the costs of the items do not change.\" So, if I have to compute the cost of six sodas and seven bars, then each soda is 150, and each bar is 0. So six sodas would be 6*150 = 900 cents. Seven bars would be 7*0 = 0. So total is 900 + 0 = 900 cents. So the answer would be E) 900.\n\nBut wait, that seems odd. Let me make sure I'm not missing something. Let me re-examine the equations.\n\nEquation 1: S + 2B = 150\nEquation 2: 2S + 3B = 300\n\nIf I subtract equation 1 multiplied by 2 from equation 2:\n\nEquation 2: 2S +3B =300\nEquation1 *2: 2S +4B=300\nSubtract: (2S+3B) - (2S+4B) = 300-300 \u2192 -B =0 \u2192 B=0.\n\nSo yeah, that's correct. So the energy bars are free. So the cost for six sodas is 6 * 150 =900, and seven bars are free. So total is 900.\n\nLooking back at the options, option E is 900. So the answer should be E.\n",

The question says that you can buy one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300 cents. Wait, that's interesting because the second option is double the first, but not exactly. Let me break it down.\n\nSo, let me assign variables to make this easier. Let's say the cost of one soda is S cents and one energy bar is B cents. Then, from the first option, I can write the equation S + 2B = 150. Got that.

Hmm, the problem gives me two different purchase options, and I need to find the individual prices of a soda and an energy bar first, I think. Then I can calculate the total cost for six sodas and seven bars.\n\nSo the first option is: one soda and two energy bars cost 150 cents. Let me write that as an equation. Let\u2019s say the cost of a soda is S cents and an energy bar is E cents. So, the first equation would be S + 2E = 150. Got that.\n\nThe second option is two sodas and three energy bars for 300 cents. So that would be 2S + 3E = 300. Alright, so now I have two equations:\n\n1. S + 2E = 150\n2. 2S + 3E = 300\n\nI need to solve this system of equations to find S and E. Let me think about how to do that. Maybe substitution or elimination. Let me try elimination.\n\nIf I multiply the first equation by 2, I get 2S + 4E = 300. Then I can subtract the second equation from this. Let's see:\n\nEquation 1 multiplied by 2: 2S +4E = 300\nEquation 2: 2S +3E = 300\nSubtract equation 2 from equation 1 multiplied by 2:\n\n(2S +4E) - (2S +3E) = 300 - 300\n2S +4E -2S -3E = 0\nWhich simplifies to E = 0?\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because if E is zero, then the first equation S + 0 = 150, so S would be 150. Then the second equation would be 2*150 + 3*0 = 300, which is correct. But energy bars can't be free, right? Or maybe they are, but that seems odd. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in subtraction. Let's recalculate.\n\nEquation 1 multiplied by 2: 2S +4E = 300\nEquation 2: 2S +3E = 300\nSubtract equation 2 from the first: (2S - 2S) + (4E -3E) = 300 -300\nSo that's 0 + E = 0. So E=0. Hmm. So E is zero, and S is 150. But then, in the second equation, 2*150 +3*0 = 300, which works. But in the first equation, 150 + 2*0 =150, which also works. So according to this, E=0 and S=150.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit strange. Energy bars are free? But maybe that's the case. Let me think if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use substitution. From equation 1: S = 150 - 2E. Then substitute that into equation 2.\n\nSo equation 2 becomes: 2*(150 -2E) +3E =300\nCalculate that: 300 -4E +3E =300\nWhich simplifies to 300 - E =300\nSubtract 300 from both sides: -E =0 \u2192 E=0.\n\nSo same result. So E is zero, and S is 150.\n\nBut that seems a bit odd because why would someone sell energy bars for free? Maybe the problem is designed that way, though.\n\nWait, the question asks for the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars. If each soda is 150 cents, then six would be 6 *150 = 900 cents. And seven energy bars are 7 *0 =0. So total is 900 cents. Looking at the options, option E is 900. So the answer would be E.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Because if E is zero, then the second option is two sodas (2*150=300) and three bars (0), which sums to 300. Which matches the given data.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about figuring out the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the problem gives me two different purchase options, and I need to find the individual prices of a soda and an energy bar first, I think. Then I can calculate the total cost for six sodas and seven bars.\n\nSo the first option is: one soda and two energy bars cost 150 cents. Let me write that as an equation. Let\u2019s say the cost of a soda is S cents and an energy bar is E cents. So, the first equation would be S + 2E = 150. Got that.\n\nThe second option is two sodas and three energy bars for 300 cents. So that would be 2S + 3E = 300. Alright, so now I have two equations:\n\n1. S + 2E = 150\n2. 2S + 3E = 300\n\nI need to solve this system of equations to find S and E. Let me think about how to do that. Maybe substitution or elimination. Let me try elimination.\n\nIf I multiply the first equation by 2, I get 2S + 4E = 300. Then I can subtract the second equation from this. Let's see:\n\nEquation 1 multiplied by 2: 2S +4E = 300\nEquation 2: 2S +3E = 300\nSubtract equation 2 from equation 1 multiplied by 2:\n\n(2S +4E) - (2S +3E) = 300 - 300\n2S +4E -2S -3E = 0\nWhich simplifies to E = 0?\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because if E is zero, then the first equation S + 0 = 150, so S would be 150. Then the second equation would be 2*150 + 3*0 = 300, which is correct. But energy bars can't be free, right? Or maybe they are, but that seems odd. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in subtraction. Let's recalculate.\n\nEquation 1 multiplied by 2: 2S +4E = 300\nEquation 2: 2S +3E = 300\nSubtract equation 2 from the first: (2S - 2S) + (4E -3E) = 300 -300\nSo that's 0 + E = 0. So E=0. Hmm. So E is zero, and S is 150. But then, in the second equation, 2*150 +3*0 = 300, which works. But in the first equation, 150 + 2*0 =150, which also works. So according to this, E=0 and S=150.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit strange. Energy bars are free? But maybe that's the case. Let me think if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use substitution. From equation 1: S = 150 - 2E. Then substitute that into equation 2.\n\nSo equation 2 becomes: 2*(150 -2E) +3E =300\nCalculate that: 300 -4E +3E =300\nWhich simplifies to 300 - E =300\nSubtract 300 from both sides: -E =0 \u2192 E=0.\n\nSo same result. So E is zero, and S is 150.\n\nBut that seems a bit odd because why would someone sell energy bars for free? Maybe the problem is designed that way, though.\n\nWait, the question asks for the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars. If each soda is 150 cents, then six would be 6 *150 = 900 cents. And seven energy bars are 7 *0 =0. So total is 900 cents. Looking at the options, option E is 900. So the answer would be E.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Because if E is zero, then the second option is two sodas (2*150=300) and three bars (0), which sums to 300. Which matches the given data. So the calculations are correct.\n\nSo, the answer must be 900 cents. So option E.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars based on the given purchase options. Let the cost of one soda be \\( S \\) cents and one energy bar be \\( E \\) cents. The problem provides two equations:\n\n1. \\( S + 2E = 150 \\)  \n2. \\( 2S + 3E = 300 \\)\n\nTo solve for \\( S \\) and \\( E \\), we use the elimination method. First, multiply the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of \\( S \\):  \n\\[\n2S + 4E = 300\n\\]  \nSubtract the second equation from this result:  \n\\[\n(2S + 4E) - (2S + 3E) = 300 - 300\n\\]  \nSimplifying gives:  \n\\[\nE = 0\n\\]  \nSubstituting \\( E = 0 \\) back into the first equation:  \n\\[\nS + 2(0) = 150 \\implies S = 150\n\\]  \n\nThus, the cost of one soda is 150 cents, and the cost of one energy bar is 0 cents. Now, calculate the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars:  \n\\[\n6S + 7E = 6(150) + 7(0) = 900 + 0 = 900\n\\]  \n\nTherefore, the total cost is 900 cents. Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:  \n**E) 900**\n\nAnswer: E",

So perhaps I made a mistake in the equations.\n\nWait, no, I think the equations are correct. So according to that, E=0. Then let's see what S would be.\n\nFrom equation 1: S + 2(0) =150 \u2192 S=150. So each soda would cost 150 cents. Let me check equation 2: 2S +3E =300 \u2192 2(150) + 3(0)=300 \u2192 300=300.

So the answer would be 900 cents, which is option E.\n\nBut wait, that seems a bit strange. Let me think again.

Wait, so there are two different combinations, and I need to find out how much each soda and each energy bar costs individually. Once I have their prices, I can compute the total for six sodas and seven bars.\n\nLet me break this down. Let's assign variables to the unknowns. Let me call the cost of one soda 's' cents and the cost of one energy bar 'e' cents. So, the first equation I can write is based on the first purchase: s + 2e = 150. That's because one soda and two bars cost 150 cents.\n\nThe second purchase is two sodas and three energy bars for 300 cents. So that translates to 2s + 3e = 300.

So total is 900+0=900.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 900. So the answer would be E)900.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is there another way to solve this? Maybe I can use substitution.

Maybe I can multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of 's' the same in both equations.\n\nMultiplying equation 1 by 2: 2s + 4e = 300. Now, the second equation is 2s + 3e = 300. Wait, so now I can subtract the second equation from the modified first equation. Let me write that down:\n\n(2s + 4e) - (2s + 3e) = 300 - 300\nSimplifying that: 2s +4e -2s -3e = 0 \u2192 (0)s + e = 0 \u2192 e = 0? That can't be right. Wait, wait, I must have made a mistake in the subtraction.\n\nWait, 300 - 300 is 0. So 2s +4e -2s -3e = 0 \u2192 (2s-2s) is 0, (4e-3e) is e. So e = 0? That can't be possible because then the first equation would be s + 0 = 150 \u2192 s=150. But then, looking at the second equation, 2*150 +0=300, which fits. Wait, but if e is zero, that would mean energy bars are free, which might be the case in this problem, but let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations. Let me double-check the setup. The first purchase is 1 soda and 2 bars = 150 cents. Second is 2 sodas and 3 bars =300 cents. So the equations are correct.\n\nWait, if e is zero, then one soda is 150, two would be 300, which fits. But then the cost of seven bars would be zero. So six sodas would be 6 *150=900, seven bars would be 0. So total is 900 +0=900. But looking at the options, E is 900. But that seems a bit high, but maybe that's the case.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did the elimination right. Another approach: Let's subtract the first equation multiplied by 1 from the second equation.\n\nWait, equation 2 is 2s +3e=300.\n\nEquation 1 is s +2e=150. Let me multiply equation 1 by 2: 2s +4e=300. Now subtract equation 2 from this: (2s+4e) - (2s+3e) = 300-300 \u2192 e=0. So e is zero. Hmm.\n\nSo s + 2e=150 \u2192 s=150. So each soda is 150 cents, each bar is 0.\n\nWait, that's a bit strange, but mathematically, it's correct. So then, the cost for six sodas is 6*150=900 cents, and seven bars is 7*0=0. So total is 900+0=900.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 900. So the answer would be E)900.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is there another way to solve this? Maybe I can use substitution. From equation 1: s=150-2e. Substitute into equation 2: 2*(150-2e) +3e=300. Let's compute that.\n\n2*(150) is 300, 2*(-2e) is -4e. So 300 -4e +3e =300 \u2192 300 -e =300 \u2192 -e =0 \u2192 e=0. So same result as before.\n\nSo yes, e=0, s=150.\n\nSo the cost of six sodas is 6*150=900, seven bars 0. So total is 900 cents. So the correct answer is E)900.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by defining the cost of one soda as \\( s \\) cents and the cost of one energy bar as \\( e \\) cents. The problem provides two equations based on the given purchase combinations:\n\n1. \\( s + 2e = 150 \\) (one soda and two energy bars cost 150 cents).\n2. \\( 2s + 3e = 300 \\) (two sodas and three energy bars cost 300 cents).\n\nTo find the values of \\( s \\) and \\( e \\), we use the elimination method. First, multiply the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of \\( s \\):\n\n\\[\n2s + 4e = 300\n\\]\n\nSubtract the second equation \\( 2s + 3e = 300 \\) from this result:\n\n\\[\n(2s + 4e) - (2s + 3e) = 300 - 300\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\ne = 0\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( e = 0 \\) back into the first equation:\n\n\\[\ns + 2(0) = 150 \\implies s = 150\n\\]\n\nThus, the cost of one soda is 150 cents, and the cost of one energy bar is 0 cents.\n\nTo find the total cost of six sodas and seven energy bars:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 6s + 7e = 6(150) + 7(0) = 900 + 0 = 900 \\, \\text{cents}.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost is 900 cents.\n\nAnswer: E",

Let me subtract the equations in a different way.\n\nEquation 1: S +2E=150\nEquation 2: 2S +3E=300\n\nLet me subtract equation 1 multiplied by 2 from equation 2. \n\nEquation 2: 2S +3E=300\nEquation 1 *2: 2S +4E=300\nSubtract equation 1*2 from equation 2:\n\n(2S +3E) - (2S +4E) = 300 - 300\n2S -2S +3E -4E = 0\n\u2192 -E =0 \u2192 E=0.\n\nSame result. So that's correct. So E is zero. So each bar is free, each soda is 150 cents.\n\nSo six sodas would be 6 *150 =900. Seven bars would be 0. So total is 900 cents. \n\nSo the answer is E)900.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we define \\( S \\) as the cost of one soda in cents and \\( E \\) as the cost of one energy bar in cents. The problem provides two equations based on the given purchase options:\n\n1. \\( S + 2E = 150 \\)  \n2. \\( 2S + 3E = 300 \\)\n\nTo solve for \\( S \\) and \\( E \\), we use the elimination method. First, multiply Equation 1 by 2:\n\n\\[\n2S + 4E = 300 \\quad \\text{(Equation 3)}\n\\]\n\nNext, subtract Equation 2 from Equation 3:\n\n\\[\n(2S + 4E) - (2S + 3E) = 300 - 300\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n2S - 2S + 4E - 3E = 0 \\implies E = 0\n\\]\n\nThis result indicates that energy bars are free (\\( E = 0 \\)). Substituting \\( E = 0 \\) into Equation 1:\n\n\\[\nS + 2(0) = 150 \\implies S = 150\n\\]\n\nThus, the cost of one soda is 150 cents, and energy bars are free.\n\nTo find the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars:\n\n\\[\n6S + 7E = 6(150) + 7(0) = 900 + 0 = 900 \\, \\text{cents}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost is 900 cents.\n\nAnswer: E",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out how much six sodas and seven energy bars would cost. Hmm, let's see. The problem gives me two different purchase options, and I think I can set up some equations based on that.\n\nSo, the first option is buying one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents. Let me write that down. Let\u2019s say the cost of one soda is 's' cents and one energy bar is 'b' cents. So the first equation would be: s + 2b = 150.\n\nThe second option is buying two sodas and three energy bars for 300 cents. That gives me the second equation: 2s + 3b = 300.\n\nNow, I need to solve these two equations to find the values of 's' and 'b'. Once I have those, I can calculate the cost for six sodas and seven bars, which would be 6s +7b.\n\nLet me think about how to solve these equations. I can use either substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination would work better here.\n\nLooking at the two equations:\n\n1) s + 2b = 150\n2) 2s + 3b = 300\n\nI can try to eliminate one of the variables. Let's try to eliminate 's'. If I multiply the first equation by 2, then I can subtract the equations.\n\nMultiplying equation 1 by 2 gives:\n2s + 4b = 300.\n\nNow, subtract equation 2 from this new equation.\n\n(2s +4b) - (2s +3b) = 300 - 300.\n\nSo that's 2s +4b -2s -3b = 0.\n\nWhich simplifies to (0s) + b = 0. So, b = 0? Wait, that can't be right. Because if b is zero, then the first equation would be s = 150. Let me check my steps again.\n\nWait, wait. Let me redo that. When I subtract equation 2 from the multiplied equation:\n\nEquation after multiplying: 2s +4b =300\nEquation 2: 2s +3b =300\nSubtracting: (2s +4b) - (2s +3b) = 300-300.\n\nSo 2s -2s =0, 4b-3b =b. So 0 +b =0. So b=0? That can't be possible because if the energy bars are free, then the second equation would imply that 2s =300, so s=150. But let's plug these back into the original equations to see if they work.\n\nIf s=150 and b=0:\n\nFirst equation: 150 + 2*0 =150 \u2192 yes, that's correct.\n\nSecond equation: 2*150 +3*0=300 \u2192 yes, correct.\n\nHmm, but that seems a bit odd because why would energy bars be free? But maybe it's a special promotion or something. So according to the equations, that's the solution.\n\nWait, but that would make the cost of six sodas and seven bars: 6*150 +7*0 =900 +0=900 cents. Which is 9 dollars. But looking at the options, E is 900. But let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should double-check the equations. Let me write them again.\n\nEquation 1: s +2b=150.\n\nEquation 2: 2s +3b=300.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Maybe I can express s from the first equation.\n\nFrom equation 1: s = 150 - 2b.\n\nNow substitute this into equation 2.\n\n2*(150 -2b) +3b =300.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n300 -4b +3b =300.\n\nSo 300 -b =300.\n\nSubtract 300 from both sides: -b =0 \u2192 b=0.\n\nSame result. So the energy bars are free. So, each soda is 150 cents, each bar is 0.\n\nSo six sodas would be 6 *150=900, seven bars are 7*0=0. Total is 900 cents. So the answer is E)900.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, E is 900. So that would be the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the first option is 1 soda and 2 bars for 150 cents. So s + 2b=150. The second is 2s and 3b=300. So 2s +3b=300.\n\nLet me try another approach, perhaps using elimination again but differently. Multiply equation 1 by 3 and equation 2 by 2.\n\nEquation1 *3: 3s +6b =450.\n\nEquation2 *2:4s +6b=600.\n\nNow subtract the first new equation from the second.\n\n(4s +6b) - (3s +6b) =600-450.\n\nWhich gives s=150.\n\nSo s=150. Then substituting back into equation1: 150 + 2b=150 \u2192 2b=0 \u2192 b=0.\n\nSame result again. So it seems consistent. So the cost for six sodas and seven bars is 6*150 +7*0=900. So E is the answer.\n",
