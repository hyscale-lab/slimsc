      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. The problem says that the sum of k consecutive integers is 51, and the least integer is -50. I need to find k. The options are A)40, B)62, C)82, D)92, E)102.\n\nHmm, right. So, consecutive integers. That means numbers that come one after another without gaps. Like if the first is n, then the next is n+1, then n+2, etc. So the series would be -50, -49, -48, ..., up to some number. And the sum of all these numbers is 51. Interesting because the sum is positive, but the starting number is negative.\n\nI remember that the sum of consecutive integers can be found using the formula for an arithmetic series. Oh wait, yes, because consecutive integers form an arithmetic sequence where the common difference is 1.\n\nThe formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is S = n/2 * (first term + last term), where n is the number of terms. So in this case, the sum S is 51, the first term a1 is -50, and the number of terms is k. The last term, which I'll call ak, is the last number in the sequence.\n\nSo, substituting into the formula: 51 = (k/2) * (-50 + ak). But I don't know ak yet. Oh wait, but since they're consecutive integers, the last term can be expressed in terms of the first term and the number of terms. The nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by a_n = a1 + (n-1)*d. Here, d is 1, so ak = a1 + (k-1)*1 = -50 + (k-1) = k - 51.\n\nSo substituting that into the sum equation: 51 = (k/2) * (-50 + (k -51)). Let me compute that. Simplify the terms inside the parentheses first.\n\n-50 + k -51 = k - 101. So the equation becomes 51 = (k/2) * (k - 101). Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator: 102 = k*(k - 101).\n\nSo that's a quadratic equation: k^2 - 101k - 102 = 0. Wait, no, because 102 = k(k-101) \u2192 k\u00b2 -101k -102 =0? Wait, wait, let me recheck. Oh no, wait: 102 = k*(k-101) \u2192 k\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0? Wait, that doesn't look right. Wait, 102 = k\u00b2 -101k \u2192 k\u00b2 -101k -102 =0. Hmm, that might be correct.\n\nWait, let me double-check the steps. So, the sum S is 51 = (k/2)(a1 + ak). a1 is -50, ak is -50 + (k-1)*1 = k-51. So a1 + ak is (-50) + (k-51) = k - 101. So 51 = (k/2)(k -101). Multiply both sides by 2: 102 = k(k -101). So k\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0.\n\nWait, but that would give me a quadratic equation. Let me try to solve that. Using the quadratic formula, k = [101 \u00b1 sqrt(101\u00b2 +4*102)] / 2. Because the equation is k\u00b2 -101k -102 =0, so a=1, b=-101, c=-102.\n\nWait, the discriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac = (-101)^2 -4*(1)*(-102) = 10201 + 408 = 10609. What's the square root of 10609? Hmm, let me think. 100^2 is 10000, so sqrt(10609) is about 103 because 103^2 is 10609. Yes, because 103 *103 is 10609. So sqrt(10609) is 103.\n\nSo, k = [101 \u00b1 103 ] / 2.\n\nSo two possibilities: (101 +103)/2 = 204/2=102, and (101-103)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1.\n\nBut k can't be negative because it's the number of terms, so k=102. But wait, looking at the options, E is 102. Hmm, but wait, let's think again.\n\nWait, wait, the sum of 102 consecutive integers starting at -50. That's a lot of terms. Let me check if this makes sense. The sum would be (number of terms) * (average of first and last term). The first term is -50, the last term is (-50 + 101) = 51. So the average is (-50 +51)/2 = (1)/2 = 0.5. So the sum is 102 * 0.5 = 51. Oh, that's correct. So k=102, which is option E.\n\nBut wait, the options don't include 102 as E. Wait, looking back at the options: A)40, B)62, C)82, D)92, E)102. Yes, E is 102. So why is the answer E? But wait, why are the other options so much smaller?\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again. Suppose the sum is 51, and the first term is -50. So the sum is 51, which is a positive number, but the average of the terms would be 51/k. Since the series starts at -50 and ends at (k-51), the average of the series is (-50 + (k-51))/2 = (k - 101)/2. So the sum is k * (k-101)/2 = 51. So k*(k-101) = 102.\n\nWait, wait, that's the same equation as before. So 102 = k^2 -101k \u2192 k\u00b2-101k -102=0. So solving this gives k=102 as the positive solution. So that's correct.\n\nBut the options include E)102. So why isn't that the correct answer? Oh, but wait, the problem is the number of terms. Wait, if I start at -50 and have k terms, the last term is -50 + (k-1)*1 = k-51. So the series is from -50 to k-51.\n\nBut wait, what if k is 102? Then the last term is 102-51=51. So the series is from -50 to 51, which is 102 terms. But the sum of that series is indeed (102/2)*(-50 +51) = 51*(1) =51. So yes, that works.\n\nBut looking at the options, E is 102, which seems correct. But wait, I thought the answer would be one of the other options. Did I miss something?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the arithmetic. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the equation was 51 = (k/2)*(-50 + (k-51)). Let me recompute that.\n\nSo, (-50) + (k-51) = k - 101. So 51 = (k/2)*(k-101). Multiply both sides by 2: 102 = k(k-101). So 102 = k\u00b2 -101k \u2192 k\u00b2 -101k -102 =0.\n\nQuadratic formula: k = [101 \u00b1 sqrt(101\u00b2 +4*102)] / 2. 101 squared is 10201, 4*102 is 408. So sqrt(10201 +408)= sqrt(10609)=103. So k=(101 +103)/2=204/2=102, and the other solution is (101-103)/2=-1. So k=102.\n\nSo the correct answer is E)102. But wait, in the options, E is 102. But I'm a bit confused because the other options are much smaller. Is there a possibility that I made a mistake in the setup?\n\nWait, another approach: the sum of consecutive integers can be thought of as the average multiplied by the number of terms. The average is (first + last)/2. So if the sum is 51, then 51 = k * average.\n\nThe average is (-50 + last)/2. The last term is (-50) + (k-1)*1 = k -51. So average is ( (-50) + (k-51) ) /2 = (k -101)/2.\n\nSo, 51 = k * (k-101)/2 \u2192 102 = k(k-101). So same equation as before. So k\u00b2 -101k -102=0. Which leads to k=102.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the sum is 51, but I'm getting 102 as the number of terms. So the answer is E)102.\n\nBut wait, the options include E)102. So why is that not the correct answer? Oh, but the options also include D)92, which is close to 100. Did I make a miscalculation in the quadratic?\n\nLet me re-calculate the quadratic solution.\n\nThe equation is k\u00b2 -101k -102=0. Using quadratic formula:\n\nk = [101 \u00b1 sqrt(101^2 + 4 *1*102)] / 2.\n\n101^2 is 10201. 4*1*102=408. So sqrt(10201+408) = sqrt(10609) =103.\n\nSo k = (101 +103)/2 = 204/2=102. And the other root is (101-103)/2= (-2)/2= -1.\n\nSo k must be 102. So the correct answer is E)102.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here. Let me read it again. The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. The least integer is -50. I need to find k. Hmm, okay.\n\nSo, I remember that the sum of consecutive integers can be calculated using the formula for an arithmetic series. Since these are consecutive integers, the common difference is 1. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is S = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference.\n\nWait, another way I remember is that the sum can also be expressed as the average of the first and last term multiplied by the number of terms. So, sum = n * (a1 + an)/2. Since the integers are consecutive, the last term is a1 + (n-1)*1, which is a1 + n -1.\n\nLet me plug in the values I have. The sum S is 51. The first term a1 is -50. The number of terms is k, which is what I'm trying to find. The last term an would be -50 + (k-1)*1 = -50 + k -1 = k -51.\n\nSo using the sum formula, 51 = k * (-50 + (k -51)) / 2. Let me write that out:\n\n51 = [k (-50 + k -51)] / 2\n\nSimplify the numerator inside the brackets: -50 -51 is -101, so it's (-101 +k).\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n51 = k (k -101) / 2\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n102 = k (k -101)\n\nExpanding that:\n\n102 = k\u00b2 - 101k\n\nBring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:\n\nk\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0\n\nHmm, now I need to solve for k. Quadratic equation, ax\u00b2 + bx + c =0, so here a=1, b=-101, c=-102.\n\nThe quadratic formula is k = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nb\u00b2 is (-101)^2 = 10201. 4ac is 4*1*(-102) = -408.\n\nSo discriminant is 10201 - (4*1*(-102)) = 10201 + 408 = 10609.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, the formula is b\u00b2 -4ac. So 10201 -4*(1)*(-102) = 10201 + 408 = 10609.\n\nWhat's the square root of 10609? Let me think. 100 squared is 10000. 103 squared is 10609, because 100+3=103. 103*103= (100)^2 + 2*100*3 +3^2 = 10000 + 600 +9= 10609. Yep, so sqrt(10609) is 103.\n\nSo the solutions are:\n\nk = [101 \u00b1 103]/(2*1)\n\nSo two possible solutions:\n\nFirst solution: (101 +103)/2 = 204/2 = 102.\n\nSecond solution: (101 -103)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1.\n\nBut k is the number of terms, which can't be negative. So k=102. Wait, but 102 is one of the options. Option E is 102.\n\nBut wait, let me check the options again. The options are A)40, B)62, C)82, D)92, E)102. So E is 102.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations. Because 102 seems quite a large number of terms. Let me think about the sequence.\n\nThe first term is -50, and the number of terms is 102. So the last term would be -50 + 101 = 51. So the series goes from -50 to 51, inclusive.\n\nWait, how many terms is that? From -50 to 51, let's see. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a +1. So 51 - (-50) +1 = 51 +50 +1= 102. That matches. So the sum of these numbers is 51.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The sum of integers from -50 to 51. Let me think about that. The sum from -n to n is zero. Because each negative cancels its positive counterpart. So from -50 to 50, the sum is zero. Then we have the terms 51, which is +51. So the total sum is 51. Oh, that's correct.\n\nSo the sum is indeed 51, and k is 102. So the answer is E.\n\nWait, but why is the option E 102? That's the correct value. So the answer should be E.\n\nBut wait, the initial calculation gave me 102, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the quadratic equation.\n\nSo the quadratic was k\u00b2 -101k -102=0.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, discriminant is 101\u00b2 +4*102. Because a=1, c=-102, so -4ac is +408.\n\n101\u00b2 is 10201. 10201 + 408 = 10609. Square root is 103. So 101 +103 is 204, divided by 2 is 102. Correct.\n\nSo the answer is E, 102. But wait, looking back at the options, option E is 102. So the correct answer should be E.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here. Let me read it again. The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. The least integer is -50. I need to find k. Hmm, okay.\n\nSo, I remember that the sum of consecutive integers can be calculated using the formula for an arithmetic series. Since these are consecutive integers, the common difference is 1. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is S = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference.\n\nWait, another way I remember is that the sum can also be expressed as the average of the first and last term multiplied by the number of terms. So, sum = n * (a1 + an)/2. Since the integers are consecutive, the last term is a1 + (n-1)*1, which is a1 + n -1.\n\nLet me plug in the values I have. The sum S is 51. The first term a1 is -50. The number of terms is k, which is what I'm trying to find. The last term an would be -50 + (k-1)*1 = -50 + k -1 = k -51.\n\nSo using the sum formula, 51 = k * (-50 + (k -51)) / 2.

Wait, the formula is b\u00b2 -4ac. So 10201 -4*(1)*(-102) = 10201 + 408 = 10609.\n\nWhat's the square root of 10609? Let me think. 100 squared is 10000. 103 squared is 10609, because 100+3=103. 103*103= (100)^2 + 2*100*3 +3^2 = 10000 + 600 +9= 10609.

But I don't know the last term yet. Wait, but I can express the last term in terms of k.\n\nSince the integers are consecutive, the difference between each term is 1. So the nth term (an) can be found using the formula: an = a1 + (n-1)*d, where d is the common difference. Here, d is 1, so an = a1 + (k-1)*1 = -50 + (k-1) = k - 51.\n\nSo substituting back into the sum formula: 51 = (k/2) * (a1 + an) = (k/2) * (-50 + (k - 51)).\n\nLet me compute that. Simplify inside the parentheses first: -50 + k -51 = k -101. So the equation becomes 51 = (k/2)*(k - 101).\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator: 102 = k*(k - 101).\n\nExpanding the right side: 102 = k\u00b2 - 101k.\n\nBring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation: k\u00b2 - 101k - 102 = 0.\n\nHmm, solving this quadratic equation.

Wait, since the product is negative, one must be positive and the other negative.\n\nLooking for a pair where one is 102 and the other is -1, because 102 * (-1) = -102 and 102 + (-1) = 101. But wait, our middle term is -101k, so perhaps the factors are 102 and -1. So, the equation factors as (k - 102)(k + 1) = 0.\n\nWait, let me check: (k - 102)(k +1) = k\u00b2 +k -102k -102 = k\u00b2 -101k -102. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the solutions are k=102 and k=-1.

Let me substitute k=102 back into the sum formula.\n\nFirst term is -50, last term is k-51 = 102-51=51. Sum is (102/2)*(-50 +51) = 51 * (1) =51.

So it's possible that the series includes a lot of negative numbers and then some positives that add up to 51.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me try another approach.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using the average. The sum is 51, which is k times the average. The average of consecutive numbers is the average of the first and last term. So 51 = k * ( (first + last)/2 ). So 51 = k*( (-50 + last)/2 ). So, 102 = k*( last -50 ). Last term is first + (k-1)*1 = -50 +k-1 =k-51. So substituting, last = k-51.\n\nSo 102 =k*( (k-51) -50 )=k*(k-101). Which leads to k\u00b2 -101k -102 =0. Which is the same quadratic as before. So same result, k=102.\n\nWait, but perhaps the quadratic has another solution. Let me compute the discriminant. Discriminant D = (101)^2 +4*102 = 10201 +408=10609. Square root of 10609 is 103, because 103*103=10609. So solutions are [101 \u00b1103]/2. So (101+103)/2=204/2=102. (101-103)/2= (-2)/2=-1.

Square root of 10609 is 103, because 103*103=10609. So solutions are [101 \u00b1103]/2. So (101+103)/2=204/2=102. (101-103)/2= (-2)/2=-1. So again, k=102 is the only valid solution.\n\nSo the answer must be E)102.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:  \n\\[\nS = \\frac{n}{2} \\cdot (a_1 + a_n)\n\\]  \nwhere \\( S \\) is the sum, \\( n \\) is the number of terms, \\( a_1 \\) is the first term, and \\( a_n \\) is the last term. Here, \\( S = 51 \\), \\( a_1 = -50 \\), and \\( n = k \\). The last term \\( a_n \\) can be expressed as \\( a_n = a_1 + (k-1) \\), which simplifies to \\( a_n = k - 51 \\).\n\nSubstituting into the sum formula:  \n\\[\n51 = \\frac{k}{2} \\cdot (-50 + (k - 51))\n\\]  \nSimplify inside the parentheses:  \n\\[\n51 = \\frac{k}{2} \\cdot (k - 101)\n\\]  \nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:  \n\\[\n102 = k \\cdot (k - 101)\n\\]  \nExpand and rearrange to form a quadratic equation:  \n\\[\nk^2 - 101k - 102 = 0\n\\]  \nSolve the quadratic equation by factoring or using the quadratic formula. Factoring gives:  \n\\[\n(k - 102)(k + 1) = 0\n\\]  \nThus, \\( k = 102 \\) or \\( k = -1 \\). Since \\( k \\) represents the number of terms, it cannot be negative, so \\( k = 102 \\).\n\nTo verify, substitute \\( k = 102 \\) back into the sum formula. The first term is \\( -50 \\), and the last term is \\( k - 51 = 102 - 51 = 51 \\). The sum is:  \n\\[\n\\frac{102}{2} \\cdot (-50 + 51) = 51 \\cdot 1 = 51\n\\]  \nThis confirms that \\( k = 102 \\) is correct. Among the given options, the correct answer is **E) 102**.\n\nAnswer: E",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe question says: The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. The least integer is -50. Then k equals which option? The options are A)40, B)62, C)82, D)92, E)102.\n\nHmm. So, I'm looking for the number of consecutive integers starting from -50 that add up to 51. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nI remember that the sum of consecutive integers can be calculated using the formula for an arithmetic series. Since these are consecutive integers, the common difference is 1. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is S = n/2 * (a1 + an), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.\n\nWait, but I don't know the last term. I only know the first term is -50, and the sum is 51. Maybe I can express the last term in terms of k, the number of terms.\n\nAlternatively, another approach could be to use the formula for the sum of consecutive integers. The sum of k consecutive integers starting from a is given by the formula: sum = k*(2a + (k-1))/2. Let me make sure I remember this correctly.\n\nWait, another way: the sum can also be thought of as the average multiplied by the number of terms. The average of consecutive integers is the average of the first and last term. So sum = k*(first + last)/2.\n\nRight, so since the first term is -50, and the last term would be (-50) + (k -1)*1, because each consecutive number is one more than the previous. So last term is (-50 + k - 1) = k -51.\n\nSo the sum is k*( (-50) + (k -51) ) / 2. And this sum is given as 51.\n\nSo let me set up the equation:\n\n51 = [k*( (-50) + (k -51) ) ] / 2\n\nLet me simplify the numerator inside the brackets:\n\n(-50) + (k -51) = k - 50 -51 = k -101.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n51 = [k*(k -101)] / 2\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n102 = k*(k -101)\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nk\u00b2 - 101k -102 = 0\n\nWait, no, because 51 * 2 is 102. So the equation is k\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0.\n\nWait, wait. Let me check that again. \n\nWait, 51 = [k*(k-101)]/2. Multiply both sides by 2: 102 = k(k -101). So expanding the right side:\n\nk\u00b2 -101k = 102.\n\nBring 102 to the left: k\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0.\n\nYes, that's correct. So now I have a quadratic equation: k\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0.\n\nI need to solve for k. Let's see if this quadratic can be factored. Or maybe I'll use the quadratic formula.\n\nQuadratic formula is: k = [101 \u00b1 sqrt(101\u00b2 + 4*102)] / 2.\n\nWait, because the standard quadratic equation is ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, so the solution is (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2-4ac)) / 2a. In this case, a=1, b=-101, c=-102.\n\nSo substituting into the formula:\n\nk = [101 \u00b1 sqrt( (-101)^2 - 4*1*(-102) ) ] / 2*1.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me get the signs right. The equation is k\u00b2 -101k -102=0, so a=1, b=-101, c=-102.\n\nSo the discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac = (-101)^2 -4*(1)*(-102) = 10201 + 408 = 10609.\n\nWait, 101 squared is 10201. 4*1*102 is 408. Since c is -102, the term becomes -4ac = -4*1*(-102) = +408. So yes, discriminant is 10201 +408 = 10609.\n\nWhat's the square root of 10609? Let me think. Hmm, 100 squared is 10000, 103 squared is 10609 because 100^2=10000, 101^2=10201, 102^2=10404, 103^2=10609. Yes, because 103 * 103 is 10609.\n\nSo sqrt(10609) = 103.\n\nSo now, the solutions are [101 \u00b1 103]/2.\n\nSo two possible solutions:\n\n(101 + 103)/2 = 204/2 = 102.\n\n(101 -103)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1.\n\nBut k is the number of terms, so it can't be negative. So k=102.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. Because if I have 102 terms starting at -50, that would go up to -50 + 101 = 51. Let me check the sum of these numbers.\n\nWait, the sum from -50 to 51 inclusive. Let me think. The sum from -n to n is zero. So from -50 to 50, sum is zero. Then the remaining terms are 51. So the sum from -50 to 51 is 51. Wait, that's exactly what the problem says.\n\nBut let me make sure. The number of terms from -50 to 51 is 50 + 51 +1 (since both ends are included). Wait, no. Wait, the number of terms from a to b inclusive is b - a +1. So from -50 to 51, it's 51 - (-50) +1 = 51 +50 +1 =102. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the sum is 51, which matches the problem statement. So k is 102, which is option E.\n\nWait, but the options given are A)40, B)62, C)82, D)92, E)102. So the correct answer is E.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because 102 seems like a lot of terms, but the math checks out. Let me think about another approach to confirm.\n\nAnother way: the sum of consecutive integers from a to b is (b -a +1)(a +b)/2.\n\nHere, a is -50, and the number of terms is k. The last term is b = a + (k-1)*1 = -50 +k-1 =k-51.\n\nSo sum S = k*(-50 + (k-51))/2 = k*(k-101)/2.\n\nSet S=51: k(k-101)/2 =51 \u2192 k(k-101)=102 \u2192k\u00b2 -101k -102=0.\n\nSame equation as before. So same solution, k=102.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer is E)102.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question says that the sum of k consecutive integers is 51, and the least integer is -50. I need to find k from the given options.\n\nHmm, consecutive integers. Right, so they follow one after another without gaps. Like, if the first is n, then the next is n+1, then n+2, and so on. So in this case, the first integer is -50, right? So the sequence would be -50, -49, -48, ..., up to some number.\n\nWait, but how many terms are there? That's what we're trying to find, k. And the sum of all these terms is 51. So I need to find k such that when I add k consecutive numbers starting from -50, the total is 51.\n\nI remember that the sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: Sum = (number of terms)/2 * (first term + last term). Oh right, because the average of the first and last term multiplied by the number of terms gives the sum.\n\nSo in this case, the sum S is 51, the number of terms is k, the first term a1 is -50, and the last term ak is (-50) + (k-1)*1, since they're consecutive integers. So ak is -50 + k - 1, which simplifies to k - 51.\n\nWait, let me make sure. Because if the first term is a1 = -50, then the second term is a2 = -49, which is a1 +1. So the nth term is a1 + (n-1)*1. So the last term, ak, is a1 + (k-1)*1 = -50 + k -1 = k-51.\n\nSo substituting into the sum formula: Sum = (k/2) * (a1 + ak) = 51. Plugging in the values, that becomes (k/2) * (-50 + (k-51)) = 51.\n\nLet me compute the inside part first. -50 + (k -51) equals (k - 51) -50, which is k - 101. So now the equation is (k/2) * (k - 101) = 51.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator: k*(k - 101) = 102.\n\nExpanding the left side: k\u00b2 - 101k = 102. Bring 102 to the left to set the equation to zero: k\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0.\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation: k\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0. I need to solve for k. Quadratic equations can be solved using the quadratic formula, which is k = [101 \u00b1 sqrt( (101)^2 +4*102 )]/2.\n\nLet me calculate the discriminant first. D = (101)^2 + 4*1*102. 101 squared is 10201, and 4*102 is 408. Adding them gives 10201 +408 = 10609.\n\nWhat's the square root of 10609? Hmm, I think 103 squared is 10609 because 100^2 is 10000, 103^2 is (100+3)^2 = 10000 + 600 +9 = 10609. So sqrt(10609) is 103.\n\nSo, the solutions are [101 \u00b1 103]/2.\n\nCalculating both possibilities:\n\n1. (101 + 103)/2 = 204/2 = 102.\n2. (101 - 103)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1.\n\nBut k can't be negative because it's the number of terms. So k must be 102.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 102. So that's one of the options. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because I feel like 102 terms adding up to 51 with a starting point of -50 seems a bit large, but maybe that's correct.\n\nWait, let me think again. The sum is 51. So adding a lot of negative and positive numbers. Starting at -50, so the first few terms are negative, then they become positive. So maybe the sum of these 102 numbers is 51. But let me check the formula again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the quadratic setup. Let me go through it again.\n\nSum = (k/2)(first + last) = 51. First is -50, last is (-50 + k -1) = k -51. So sum is (k/2)(-50 + (k-51)).\n\nWait, that's (k/2)(k-101) =51.\n\nSo yeah, that's correct. So when I multiplied both sides by 2, I got k(k-101)=102.\n\nWhich becomes k\u00b2 -101k -102=0.\n\nQuadratic formula: [101 \u00b1 sqrt( (101)^2 +4*102 ) ]/(2). Which is [101 \u00b1 103]/2.\n\nWait, but the discriminant is (101)^2 +4*102? Wait, the equation is k\u00b2 -101k -102 =0, so a=1, b=-101, c=-102.\n\nSo the discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac = (-101)^2 -4*(1)*(-102) = 10201 +408=10609, which is correct. So sqrt(10609)=103.\n\nSo solutions are (101 +103)/2=204/2=102 and (101-103)/2= -2/2=-1. So only k=102 is valid.\n\nBut wait, the options include E) 102. So that's the answer. But wait, I'm a bit surprised because 102 terms is a lot, but let's see.\n\nLet me think about the series. Starting at -50, and adding 102 terms. The last term is -50 + 101 =51. So the terms go from -50 to 51, inclusive? Wait, wait, wait. No, wait: the number of terms is 102. So starting at -50, the next term is -49, and so on until the 102nd term is (-50) + (102-1) = -50 + 101=51. So the sequence is from -50 to 51, but how many numbers is that?\n\nWait, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is (b -a) +1. So from -50 to 51, the count is (51 - (-50)) +1 = 101 +1=102. So that's correct.\n\nSo the sum is the average of the first and last term multiplied by the number of terms. The first term is -50, the last is 51. The average is ( (-50) +51 )/2 = (1)/2=0.5. Multiply by 102 terms: 0.5 *102=51. That's exactly the sum we have. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo k must be 102, which is option E.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question says that the sum of k consecutive integers is 51, and the least integer is -50. I need to find k from the given options.\n\nHmm, consecutive integers. Right, so they follow one after another without gaps. Like, if the first is n, then the next is n+1, then n+2, and so on. So in this case, the first integer is -50, right? So the sequence would be -50, -49, -48, ..., up to some number.\n\nWait, but how many terms are there? That's what we're trying to find, k. And the sum of all these terms is 51. So I need to find k such that when I add k consecutive numbers starting from -50, the total is 51.\n\nI remember that the sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: Sum = (number of terms)/2 * (first term + last term). Oh right, because the average of the first and last term multiplied by the number of terms gives the sum.\n\nSo in this case, the sum S is 51, the number of terms is k, the first term a1 is -50, and the last term ak is (-50) + (k-1)*1, since they're consecutive integers. So ak is -50 + k - 1, which simplifies to k - 51.\n\nWait, let me make sure. Because if the first term is a1 = -50, then the second term is a2 = -49, which is a1 +1. So the nth term is a1 + (n-1)*1. So the last term, ak, is a1 + (k-1)*1 = -50 + k -1 = k-51.\n\nSo substituting into the sum formula: Sum = (k/2) * (a1 + ak) = 51. Plugging in the values, that becomes (k/2) * (-50 + (k-51)) = 51.\n\nLet me compute the inside part first. -50 + (k -51) equals (k - 51) -50, which is k - 101. So now the equation is (k/2) * (k - 101) = 51.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator: k*(k - 101) = 102.\n\nExpanding the left side: k\u00b2 - 101k = 102. Bring 102 to the left to set the equation to zero: k\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0.\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation: k\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0. I need to solve for k. Quadratic equations can be solved using the quadratic formula, which is k = [101 \u00b1 sqrt( (101)^2 +4*102 )]/2.\n\nLet me calculate the discriminant first. D = (101)^2 + 4*1*102. 101 squared is 10201, and 4*102 is 408. Adding them gives 10201 +408 = 10609.\n\nWhat's the square root of 10609? Hmm, I think 103 squared is 10609 because 100^2 is 10000, 103^2 is (100+3)^2 = 10000 + 600 +9 = 10609.

(101 - 103)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1.\n\nBut k can't be negative because it's the number of terms. So k must be 102.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 102. So that's one of the options.

Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the sum of consecutive integers can be found using the formula for an arithmetic series. Since these are consecutive integers, the common difference is 1. So the series starts at -50 and each next term increases by 1.\n\nThe formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is S = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference. In this case, S is 51, a is -50, and d is 1. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Wait, the formula can also be written as S = n * (a1 + an)/2, where a1 is the first term and an is the last term. Since the numbers are consecutive, the last term would be a1 + (k-1)*1, which is a1 + k -1.\n\nSo maybe it's easier to use the formula S = k/2 * [2a + (k-1)*d]. Plugging in the values I have: 51 = k/2 * [2*(-50) + (k-1)*1]. Let me calculate that.\n\nSimplify the equation step by step. 51 equals (k/2) times [ -100 + (k -1) ]. So that becomes (k/2) * (k - 101). So, 51 = (k (k - 101)) / 2. Multiply both sides by 2: 102 = k^2 - 101k. Then, bringing all terms to one side: k^2 -101k -102 =0.\n\nHmm, solving this quadratic equation. The quadratic formula is k = [101 \u00b1 sqrt(101^2 + 4*102)] / 2. Let's compute the discriminant: 101^2 is 10201, and 4*102 is 408. So discriminant is 10201 + 408 = 10609.\n\nWhat's the square root of 10609? Let me think. 100 squared is 10000, 103 squared is 10609 because 103*103 is (100+3)^2 = 10000 + 600 +9 = 10609. So sqrt(10609) is 103.\n\nSo k = [101 \u00b1103]/2. That gives two possibilities: (101 +103)/2 = 204/2=102, and (101-103)/2= (-2)/2= -1.\n\nBut k can't be negative, so k must be 102. Wait, but wait a minute, the options don't have 102 as the first choice. Let me check the options again. The options are A)40, B)62, C)82, D)92, E)102. Oh, E is 102. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check. Because sometimes when dealing with negative numbers, the sum might have a different behavior. Let me calculate the sum manually for k=102.\n\nThe series starts at -50 and has 102 terms. The last term would be -50 +101 =51, since the terms are consecutive. So the sum is (number of terms) * (first + last)/2. So 102 * (-50 +51)/2 = 102*(1/2)=51. Oh, that's correct. So k=102, which is option E.\n\nBut wait, another approach: the sum of consecutive integers can also be considered as the average of the first and last term multiplied by the number of terms. So if the sum is 51, and the average is (first + last)/2, then 51 = k * ( (-50 + last)/2 ). The last term is (-50) + (k-1)*1, so last = (-50) +k-1 = k-51.\n\nSo substituting, 51 = k*( ( (-50) + (k-51) ) /2 ). Simplify inside the parentheses: (-50 +k-51) =k -101. So 51= k*(k-101)/2. Which brings us back to the same equation: 102 =k^2 -101k, so same quadratic as before. So same solution, k=102.\n\nSo why is the answer E)102? Because all the steps lead to that.

The last term is (-50) + (k-1)*1, so last = (-50) +k-1 = k-51.\n\nSo substituting, 51 = k*( ( (-50) + (k-51) ) /2 ). Simplify inside the parentheses: (-50 +k-51) =k -101. So 51= k*(k-101)/2. Which brings us back to the same equation: 102 =k^2 -101k, so same quadratic as before. So same solution, k=102.\n\nSo why is the answer E)102? Because all the steps lead to that. So the correct answer is E.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The sum \\( S \\) of \\( k \\) consecutive integers starting from \\( a \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{k}{2} \\cdot [2a + (k-1)d]\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( S = 51 \\), \\( a = -50 \\), and \\( d = 1 \\) (since the integers are consecutive). Substituting these values:\n\n\\[\n51 = \\frac{k}{2} \\cdot [2(-50) + (k-1)(1)]\n\\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\\[\n51 = \\frac{k}{2} \\cdot [-100 + k - 1]\n\\]\n\n\\[\n51 = \\frac{k}{2} \\cdot (k - 101)\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n\\[\n102 = k(k - 101)\n\\]\n\nExpand and rearrange:\n\n\\[\nk^2 - 101k - 102 = 0\n\\]\n\nSolve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -101 \\), and \\( c = -102 \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here: the sum of k consecutive integers is 51, and the least integer is -50. I need to find k. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nAlright, so the problem is about consecutive integers. I remember that when dealing with the sum of consecutive numbers, there are some formulas I can use. Let me try to recall them. Oh right, the sum of an arithmetic series. Since these are consecutive integers, they form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1.\n\nThe formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is S = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference. In this case, d is 1 because they're consecutive integers. So the formula simplifies to S = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)*1) \u2192 S = n/2 * (2a + n -1).\n\nWait, but the problem says the sum is 51. So S = 51. And the least integer is -50, which is the first term a. So a = -50.\n\nPutting it into the formula: 51 = (k/2) * [2*(-50) + (k -1)*1].\n\nLet me calculate that step by step. Let's compute the terms inside the brackets first.\n\n2*(-50) is -100. Then, (k-1)*1 is just (k-1). So adding those together gives (-100 + k -1) which simplifies to (k - 101). So the equation becomes:\n\n51 = (k/2) * (k - 101)\n\nHmm, so multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n102 = k * (k - 101)\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n102 = k\u00b2 - 101k\n\nNow, rearranging to form a quadratic equation:\n\nk\u00b2 - 101k - 102 = 0\n\nWait, that's a quadratic equation in the form of ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0. Let me write it down:\n\nk\u00b2 - 101k - 102 = 0\n\nI need to solve for k. Since it's a quadratic, I can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is k = [ -b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 4ac) ] / (2a). Here, a is 1, b is -101, and c is -102.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nk = [101 \u00b1 sqrt( (-101)^2 - 4*1*(-102) ) ] / (2*1)\n\nCalculating the discriminant first: D = (101)^2 - 4*1*(-102) = 10201 + 408 = 10609.\n\nWhat's the square root of 10609? Hmm, let me think. 100 squared is 10000. 103 squared is 10609 because 100^2=10000, 103^2= (100+3)^2 = 10000 + 600 +9 = 10609. Oh right, so sqrt(10609) is 103.\n\nSo now, substituting back:\n\nk = [101 \u00b1 103] / 2\n\nThis gives two possible solutions:\n\nk = (101 + 103)/2 = 204/2 = 102\nk = (101 - 103)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1\n\nWait, but k represents the number of terms, which can't be negative. So k must be 102. But let me double-check because sometimes when solving quadratics, especially with context, the positive solution might not make sense in the problem's context.\n\nWait, let's think again. If k is 102, then the sequence starts at -50 and has 102 terms. Let me see if the sum makes sense. Let me compute the average of the first and last term and multiply by the number of terms.\n\nThe first term is -50, and the last term would be (-50 + 101) because the difference is (k-1)*1. So 102 terms would have the last term as -50 + 101 = 51. So the average is (-50 +51)/2 = (1)/2 = 0.5. Then the sum is 0.5 * 102 = 51. That's correct.\n\nWait, but another thing to check: the number of terms is 102, which is one of the options, option E. But looking at the options, the choices are A)40, B)62, C)82, D)92, E)102. So option E is 102. So that's the answer.\n\nBut wait a second, let me think again. If k is 102, that's a lot of terms. Let me see if I made any mistakes in the formula.\n\nLet me re-express the sum formula. The sum of k consecutive integers starting from a is equal to k*(a + (k-1)/2). Wait, or wait, the formula is sum = k*(a + (a + k -1))/2. Which is same as k*(2a + k -1)/2. So yes, the formula I used earlier was correct.\n\nAnother approach: The sum of consecutive integers can also be thought of as the average multiplied by the number of terms. The average of the sequence is the midpoint between the first and last term.\n\nSo, the first term is -50, last term is (-50 + k -1) = (k -51). The average is [ -50 + (k -51) ] / 2. So the average is (k - 101)/2.\n\nSum = average * k \u2192 51 = (k -101)/2 * k.\n\nWhich again leads to the same equation as before: 51 = k(k-101)/2 \u2192 102 = k(k-101) \u2192 same quadratic. So that's correct.\n\nSo the solution is k=102, which is option E.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Let me think about the terms. If I have 102 terms starting at -50, the last term is -50 + 101 = 51. So the sum is the sum from -50 to 51 inclusive. Let me see how many numbers that is.\n\nWait, how many integers are from -50 to 51? Let's compute it. The count is (51 - (-50)) +1 = 101 +1 = 102. So yes, that's correct. The sum is 51, so that's right.\n\nBut wait, what's the sum from -50 to 51? Let me calculate that quickly. The sum from -50 to 50 is zero because they cancel out. Then adding 51 gives 51. So yes, the sum is 51. That makes sense.\n\nSo the correct answer is E) 102.\n",

Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nI remember that the sum of consecutive integers can be calculated using the formula for an arithmetic series. Since they're consecutive, the common difference is 1. Oh right, the formula is Sum = (number of terms) \u00d7 (first term + last term) / 2. So, Sum = k * (a1 + ak) / 2.\n\nIn this case, the sum is 51, and the first term a1 is -50. I need to find k. But wait, I don't know the last term, which I'll call ak. So maybe I can express ak in terms of k.\n\nSince the numbers are consecutive, the nth term is a1 + (n-1)*d. Here, d is 1, so ak = a1 + (k-1)*1. So ak = -50 + (k-1) = k -51.\n\nNow, substituting into the sum formula:\n51 = k * (a1 + ak) / 2\nBut a1 is -50, and ak is k-51. So:\n51 = k * (-50 + (k -51)) / 2\n\nLet me simplify the numerator inside the parentheses:\n-50 + k -51 = k - 101\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n51 = k*(k - 101) / 2\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the denominator:\n102 = k(k -101)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\nk^2 -101k -102 = 0\n\nNow I have a quadratic equation: k^2 -101k -102 = 0.\n\nI need to solve for k. Let's try using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is k = [101 \u00b1 sqrt(101^2 + 4*102)] / 2.\n\nWait, wait, let me calculate the discriminant correctly. The discriminant D is b\u00b2 -4ac. Here, a=1, b=-101, c=-102.\n\nSo D = (-101)^2 -4*(1)*(-102) = 10201 + 408 = 10609.\n\nWhat's the square root of 10609? Let me think. 100 squared is 10000, 103 squared is 10609. Oh yes, because 103*103 is 10609. So sqrt(10609)=103.\n\nSo the solutions are:\nk = [101 \u00b1103]/2\n\nThat gives two possibilities:\nk = (101 +103)/2 = 204/2 =102\nk = (101 -103)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1\n\nBut k can't be negative because it's the number of terms. So k=102.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check this because 102 is one of the options, option E. But I remember sometimes when you have a series that includes negative numbers, maybe the number of terms could be different.\n\nWait, let me think again. If the first term is -50 and the series has 102 terms, the last term would be -50 +101 =51. So the series runs from -50 to 51, inclusive. Let me calculate the sum to see if it's correct.\n\nThe number of terms is 102. The first term is -50, the last term is 51. Sum is (102)*(-50 +51)/2 = 102*(1)/2 = 102*(0.5)=51. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, 102 is an option, but let me see if any of the other options make sense. For example, option B is 62. Let me see what would happen if k was 62.\n\nIf k=62, then the last term would be -50 +61=11. Sum would be 62*(-50+11)/2 =62*(-39)/2 =62*(-19.5) = -1215, which is not 51. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic equation. Let me recheck the steps.\n\nThe sum is 51 = [k*(-50 + (k-51))]/2. So:\n\n51 = k*(k-101)/2\nMultiply both sides by 2: 102 =k(k-101)\nWhich is k\u00b2 -101k -102 =0.\n\nYes, that's correct. Quadratic is correct.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where the sum of k consecutive integers is 51. The least integer is -50, and I need to find k. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nI remember that the sum of consecutive integers can be calculated using the formula for an arithmetic series. Since they're consecutive, the common difference is 1. Oh right, the formula is Sum = (number of terms) \u00d7 (first term + last term) / 2. So, Sum = k * (a1 + ak) / 2.\n\nIn this case, the sum is 51, and the first term a1 is -50. I need to find k. But wait, I don't know the last term, which I'll call ak. So maybe I can express ak in terms of k.\n\nSince the numbers are consecutive, the nth term is a1 + (n-1)*d. Here, d is 1, so ak = a1 + (k-1)*1. So ak = -50 + (k-1) = k -51.\n\nNow, substituting into the sum formula:\n51 = k * (a1 + ak) / 2\nBut a1 is -50, and ak is k-51. So:\n51 = k * (-50 + (k -51)) / 2\n\nLet me simplify the numerator inside the parentheses:\n-50 + k -51 = k - 101\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n51 = k*(k - 101) / 2\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the denominator:\n102 = k(k -101)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\nk^2 -101k -102 = 0\n\nNow I have a quadratic equation: k^2 -101k -102 = 0.\n\nI need to solve for k. Let's try using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is k = [101 \u00b1 sqrt(101^2 + 4*102)] / 2.\n\nWait, wait, let me calculate the discriminant correctly. The discriminant D is b\u00b2 -4ac. Here, a=1, b=-101, c=-102.\n\nSo D = (-101)^2 -4*(1)*(-102) = 10201 + 408 = 10609.\n\nWhat's the square root of 10609? Let me think. 100 squared is 10000, 103 squared is 10609. Oh yes, because 103*103 is 10609. So sqrt(10609)=103.\n\nSo the solutions are:\nk = [101 \u00b1103]/2\n\nThat gives two possibilities:\nk = (101 +103)/2 = 204/2 =102\nk = (101 -103)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1\n\nBut k can't be negative because it's the number of terms. So k=102.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check this because 102 is one of the options, option E. But I remember sometimes when you have a series that includes negative numbers, maybe the number of terms could be different.\n\nWait, let me think again. If the first term is -50 and the series has 102 terms, the last term would be -50 +101 =51. So the series runs from -50 to 51, inclusive. Let me calculate the sum to see if it's correct.\n\nThe number of terms is 102. The first term is -50, the last term is 51. Sum is (102)*(-50 +51)/2 = 102*(1)/2 = 102*(0.5)=51. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, 102 is an option, but let me see if any of the other options make sense. For example, option B is 62. Let me see what would happen if k was 62.\n\nIf k=62, then the last term would be -50 +61=11. Sum would be 62*(-50+11)/2 =62*(-39)/2 =62*(-19.5) = -1215, which is not 51. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic equation. Let me recheck the steps.\n\nThe sum is 51 = [k*(-50 + (k-51))]/2. So:\n\n51 = k*(k-101)/2\nMultiply both sides by 2: 102 =k(k-101)\nWhich is k\u00b2 -101k -102 =0.\n\nYes, that's correct. Quadratic is correct. So the only positive solution is 102.\n\nSo the answer should be E)102.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
