      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Sam's hard drive with 250 files, all infected by either a virus or a worm or both. Hmm, I need to figure out how many files were not infected by a worm. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with sets and their overlaps, a Venn diagram approach might work. So, let's consider two sets: V for virus-infected files and W for worm-infected files. The problem states that all 250 files are infected by either virus or worm or both, so the total is the union of V and W, which is V \u222a W = 250.\n\nThe problem also says that the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both. Let me denote the number of files infected by both as B. So, the only worm-infected files would be 2.5B.\n\nWait, right, because only worm is W without the overlap. So, W_only = 2.5B.\n\nAlso, the problem states that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. Since there are 250 files, 50% is 125 files. So, the number of files not infected by a virus is 125. That means the number of files infected by a virus is 250 - 125 = 125. So, V = 125.\n\nWait, but V is the total number of files infected by a virus, which includes those that are only virus and those that are both. So, V = V_only + B. We know V is 125, so V_only + B = 125.\n\nSimilarly, W is the total worm-infected files, which includes W_only + B. So, W = W_only + B. But W_only is 2.5B, so W = 2.5B + B = 3.5B.\n\nNow, the total number of files is the union of V and W, which is V + W - B = 250. Because when you add V and W, the overlap B is counted twice, so you subtract it once.\n\nSo, substituting in the values we have:\n\nV + W - B = 250\n125 + (3.5B) - B = 250\nSimplify that: 125 + 2.5B = 250\nSubtract 125 from both sides: 2.5B = 125\nDivide both sides by 2.5: B = 50.\n\nSo, the number of files infected by both is 50. \n\nNow, let's find out W, which is 3.5B. So, 3.5 *50 = 175. So, W is 175.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking how many files were NOT infected by a worm. The total files are 250. So, not infected by a worm would be 250 - W. Because W is the number of files infected by a worm (including both only worm and both).\n\nSo, 250 - 175 = 75. So, the answer should be 75, which is option C.\n\nLet me double-check my steps. I calculated V as 125, which is correct because 50% of 250 is 125 not infected by virus, so 125 are. Then, W is 3.5B, and with B=50, that gives W=175. So, 250 -175 is 75. Yes, that makes sense.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by defining the total number of files as 250. Let \\( V \\) represent the number of files infected by a virus, and \\( W \\) represent the number of files infected by a worm.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about Sam's hard drive with 250 files, all infected by either a virus or a worm or both. I need to find how many files were not infected by a worm. Hmm, let's think.\n\nAlright, the question says all 250 are infected by either virus or worm or both. So, no files are outside these categories. But wait, the options are about not being infected by a worm. Oh, right, because some could be only virus, some both, and some only worm.\n\nWait, the problem states that the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number infected by both. Let me write that down. Let me denote:\n\nLet B be the number of files infected by both virus and worm. So, only worm would be 2.5 * B, right?\n\nThen, the total infected by virus would be the sum of those only virus plus both. But wait, how do I find that?\n\nOh, the problem also says that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. So, 50% of 250 is 125. That means 125 files are not infected by a virus. So, the remaining 125 are infected by a virus, either only virus or both.\n\nSo, the total virus-infected files are 125. Which is equal to (only virus) + (both virus and worm). Let's denote only virus as V. So, V + B = 125.\n\nWe also have that only worm is 2.5 * B, which I'll call W. So, W = 2.5 B.\n\nNow, the total number of files is all the files, which is 250. So, V (only virus) + W (only worm) + B (both) = 250.\n\nWait, no. Because the total is V + W + B. Because each file is in one of these three categories: only virus, only worm, both. So, V + W + B = 250.\n\nWait, no. Because all 250 are infected by either virus or worm or both. So, no files are outside that. So, the sum should be 250. Let me write that equation.\n\nSo, V + W + B = 250.\n\nBut wait, I think I made a mistake. Because the files are either only virus, only worm, or both. So, the total is V + W + B. But wait, no, that's not correct. Because V is only virus, W is only worm, and B is both. So, the sum is V + W + B = total. But wait, that's the same as (V + B) + (W) = (Virus) + (Worm only) = 250.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.\n\nLet me rephrase the variables:\n\n- Let B = number of files infected by both virus and worm.\n- Then, the number of files only infected by worm is W = 2.5 * B.\n- The number of files infected by virus is V = only virus + both, which is V = (Virus only) + B.\n\nBut wait, the problem says 50% of the files are not infected by a virus. So, 50% of 250 is 125. So, the number of files not infected by virus is 125. Which means the number of files that are infected by virus is 250 - 125 = 125.\n\nSo, the total virus-infected files (both only virus and both) is 125. So, V + B = 125. Where V is only virus.\n\nBut we also know that W = 2.5 B. And the total number of files is V + W + B. Because all files are either only virus, only worm, or both.\n\nSo, V + W + B = 250.\n\nSubstituting V = 125 - B and W = 2.5 B.\n\nSo, (125 - B) + (2.5 B) + B = 250.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n125 - B + 2.5 B + B = 250.\n\nCombine like terms: 125 + ( -B + 2.5B + B ) = 250.\n\nThe coefficients for B: (-1 + 2.5 + 1) = 2.5.\n\nSo, 125 + 2.5 B = 250.\n\nSubtract 125 from both sides: 2.5 B = 125.\n\nSo, B = 125 / 2.5 = 50.\n\nSo, B is 50.\n\nThen, W = 2.5 * 50 = 125.\n\nAnd V = 125 (virus total) - B (50) = 75.\n\nSo, V is 75, W is 125, B is 50.\n\nWait, let me check the total: 75 (only virus) + 125 (only worm) +50 (both) = 250. Yes, that adds up.\n\nBut the question asks: how many files were NOT infected by a worm.\n\nHmm, not infected by a worm would be files that are only virus, right? Because if a file is only virus, it's not a worm. And if it's both, it's infected by a worm. So, the files not infected by a worm are V, which is 75.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. Because if a file is only virus, it's not worm. If it's both, it's worm. If it's only worm, it's worm. So, the number of files not infected by worm is only V, which is 75.\n\nSo, looking at the options, the answer should be 75, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the setup. Another way to approach is using set theory.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nTotal = V \u222a W = 250.\n\nWe know that all are in V or W or both, so V \u222a W = 250.\n\nNumber of files only in W is 2.5 times the number in both. So, W_only = 2.5 * B.\n\nAlso, the number of files not in V is 125. So, the number in V is 125.\n\nWhich is, V = V_only + B.\n\nSo, V_only = 125 - B.\n\nAnd total files:\n\nV_only + W_only + B = 250.\n\nWhich is (125 - B) + (2.5 B) + B = 250.\n\nWhich simplifies to 125 + 2.5 B = 250.\n\nSo, 2.5 B = 125 \u2192 B =50.\n\nSo, W_only is 2.5 *50 = 125.\n\nV_only is 125 -50=75.\n\nSo, the number of files not infected by worm is V_only =75.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about Sam's hard drive with 250 files, all infected by either a virus or a worm or both. Hmm, I need to figure out how many files are not infected by a worm. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the problem says that all 250 files are infected by either a virus, a worm, or both. So there are no files outside these two categories. That makes sense.\n\nThe next part says the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number infected by both. So let's denote some variables. Let me think, maybe let\u2019s say:\n\nLet\u2019s let B be the number of files infected by both virus and worm. Then, the number of files infected only by worm would be 2.5 times B, so that's 2.5B.\n\nWait, right, because only worm is 2.5 times the both category. So that's W_only = 2.5B.\n\nNow, what about the files infected only by virus? Let me think. The total number of files is 250, and all are infected by at least one. So the total is:\n\nVirus_only + Worm_only + Both = 250.\n\nI can write that as V + W + B = 250, but wait, no, V is the only virus, W is only worm. So V_only = total virus - both, and W_only is worm only.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The total number infected by virus OR worm is equal to those infected by virus plus those by worm minus those by both. So:\n\nTotal = V + W - B.\n\nBut since all files are infected by either, total is 250. So 250 = V + W - B.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the easiest way. Maybe let me think about the given info again.\n\nThe problem says that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. So 50% of 250 is 125. That means 125 files are not infected by a virus. So these 125 must be infected by a worm, but not a virus, right? Wait, no. Because if a file isn't infected by a virus, it could be either not infected at all or only by a worm. But the problem says all 250 are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. So the 125 files not infected by a virus must be the ones infected only by the worm. Oh, because if they're not infected by a virus, they must be infected by a worm, since all are infected by at least one.\n\nSo the number of files only infected by worm (W_only) is 125. Wait, but wait, earlier I thought W_only is 2.5 times B. So 125 = 2.5 * B. Let me solve for B.\n\nSo B = 125 / 2.5. Let me compute that. 125 divided by 2.5 is 50. So B is 50. So 50 files are infected by both virus and worm.\n\nNow, what's the question again? How many files were not infected by a worm. So files not infected by a worm would be those infected only by the virus, plus those not infected by either. Wait, but the problem says all files are infected by at least one, so no files are not infected by either. So the only files not infected by a worm are those infected only by the virus.\n\nSo how many are only infected by virus? Let's compute that.\n\nFrom the inclusion-exclusion, total = virus_only + worm_only + both. So virus_only is V = total_virus_infected - both.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. The total number of files infected by a virus is V_total = virus_only + both. Similarly, the total worm is W_total = worm_only + both.\n\nWe know that worm_only is 125, and both is 50. So W_total = 125 + 50 = 175.\n\nBut how does that help? Wait, the 50% not infected by virus is 125, which are worm only. So the other 125 must be infected by virus. But wait, no. Because the 125 not infected by virus are worm only, so the remaining 125 are virus only plus both. Because total is 250.\n\nWait, let me think again. The number of files not infected by virus is 125, which are the worm only. So the number of files infected by virus is 250 - 125 = 125. So V_total = 125.\n\nBut V_total is virus_only + both. So virus_only = V_total - both = 125 - 50 = 75.\n\nSo the number of files infected only by virus is 75. Since all other files are worm only or both, which are 125 +50 =175. 75 +175=250. That makes sense.\n\nSo the files not infected by a worm are the virus only, which is 75. So the answer would be 75. Looking at the options, option C is 75.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The number of files not infected by a worm is the same as the number of files only infected by virus, which is 75. Yes, because any file not infected by a worm can't be worm only or both. So yes, 75.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Sam's hard drive and some infected files. Hmm, let's see. I need to figure out how many files were not infected by a worm. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nThe problem says that all 250 files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. So, every single file has at least one of them. That means the total number of files is the union of virus-infected and worm-infected files. No files are outside this union.\n\nLet me think about the variables involved. Let me denote:\n\n- Let V be the number of files infected by a virus.\n- Let W be the number of files infected by a worm.\n- Let B be the number of files infected by both virus and worm.\n\nWait, but the problem states that all 250 files are infected by either or both, so V \u222a W = 250. The formula for the union is V + W - B = 250. That's one equation I can use.\n\nNext, the problem says that the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both. So, only worm is W - B, right? Because W includes those with both, so subtracting B gives only worm.\n\nSo, W - B = 2.5 * B. Let me write that down: W - B = 2.5B. That can be rearranged to W = 3.5B. Hmm, okay.\n\nThen, the problem states that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. Wait, 50% of 250 is 125 files. So, 125 files are not infected by a virus. That means those 125 are only worm or neither? But wait, the problem says all files are infected by at least one. So, the 125 are only worm. Because if they weren't infected by a virus, they must be infected by a worm, since all are infected by either or both.\n\nWait, is that correct? Because if a file isn't infected by a virus, it must be infected by a worm, since all are either virus, worm, or both. So, the number of files not infected by a virus is the number of files infected only by worm. Because if they are infected by both, they are counted in virus as well. So, the only ones not in virus are those only in worm. So, W_only = 125.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier we have W_only = W - B = 2.5B. So, 2.5B equals 125? Let me check that.\n\nWait, according to the problem: 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. So, 50% of 250 is 125. So, 125 files are not in V. Since all files are either in V or W or both, these 125 must be in W only. So, W_only = 125. But from the problem statement, W_only is 2.5 times the both category. So, W_only = 2.5 * B.\n\nSo, 2.5 * B = 125. Let me solve for B.\n\nB = 125 / 2.5. Let's compute that. 125 divided by 2.5. Hmm, 2.5 times 50 is 125, so B = 50. So, 50 files are infected by both virus and worm.\n\nThen, since W_only is 125, W = W_only + B = 125 + 50 = 175. So, W is 175.\n\nNow, what about V? Because V includes files infected only by virus and those infected by both. We can find V from the union formula.\n\nThe union is V + W - B = 250. So, V + 175 - 50 = 250. So, V + 125 = 250. Therefore, V = 125.\n\nWait, so V is 125. But wait, V includes files that are only virus plus those that are both. So, V_only = V - B = 125 - 50 =75. So, 75 files are only virus.\n\nBut the question is asking for the number of files not infected by a worm. So, how many files are not in W?\n\nSince all 250 files are in V or W or both, the files not in W must be only those in V. Because if a file is in V, it could be only V or both. But those in both are in W as well. So, the only files not in W are the ones only in V.\n\nSo, number of files not in W is V_only =75. So, the answer should be 75, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recap the steps.\n\n1. Total files: 250.\n\n2. All files are in V or W or both. So, V \u222a W =250.\n\n3. 50% not infected by virus \u2192 125 not in V \u2192 these must be in W only. So, W_only =125.\n\n4. Given that W_only =2.5 * B \u2192 125=2.5B \u2192 B=50.\n\n5. So, W = W_only + B =125+50=175.\n\n6. Using union formula: V + W - B =250 \u2192 V +175 -50=250 \u2192 V=125.\n\n7. V_only = V - B =125-50=75.\n\n8.

The number of files infected only by a worm (\\( W \\)) is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both (\\( B \\)):  \n   \\[\n   W = 2.5B\n   \\]  \n3. 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. Since all files are infected by either a virus or a worm, the files not infected by a virus are those infected only by a worm (\\( W \\)). Thus:  \n   \\[\n   W = 0.5 \\times 250 = 125\n   \\]  \n\nUsing \\( W = 2.5B \\), substitute \\( W = 125 \\):  \n\\[\n125 = 2.5B \\implies B = \\frac{125}{2.5} = 50\n\\]  \n\nNow, substitute \\( W = 125 \\) and \\( B = 50 \\) into \\( V + W + B = 250 \\):  \n\\[\nV + 125 + 50 = 250 \\implies V = 250 - 175 = 75\n\\]  \n\nThe number of files not infected by a worm is the number of files infected only by a virus (\\( V \\)), which is 75.  \n\nThus, the answer is **C) 75**.  \n\nAnswer: C",

Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nAlright, so there are 250 files in total. All of them are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. So, no file is completely clean, which means the total number of infected files is 250. \n\nThe problem states that the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let me write that down. Let's say the number of files infected by both is B. Then the number of files only by worm would be 2.5 * B. \n\nWait, right. So the only worm-infected files are 2.5B. And the only virus files would be something else. Oh wait, I'm getting confused. Wait, the total files are 250, and all are infected by either one or both. So the total is the sum of only virus, only worm, and both.\n\nWait, the other part says that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. Oh, that's an important point. So 50% of 250 is 125 files. These are the files not infected by a virus. Which means those files must be only worm-infected or not infected by anything. But wait, the problem says all files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. So the 125 files not infected by a virus must be infected only by the worm. Because if they weren't infected by a virus, they must have been infected by the worm. So the only worm-infected files are 125.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point. So the number of files only infected by a worm is 125. But earlier, the problem says that the only worm-infected files are 2.5 times the number of files infected by both. So if only worm is 125, then 125 = 2.5 * B, where B is the both.\n\nSolving for B: B = 125 / 2.5 = 50. So 50 files are infected by both virus and worm.\n\nNow, let's think about the virus part. The total number of virus-infected files (including those that have both) is the number of only virus plus B. But how do I find that? Oh, wait, the 50% not infected by a virus means that 50% were infected by the worm. Wait, no, wait. Let me recheck. \n\nWait, the problem states that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus.

So if a file isn't infected by a virus, it's infected by a worm only.\n\nSo from earlier, we found that the only worm files are 125, which is 2.5 times the both. So B is 50. \n\nNow, the total files can be broken down into:\n\nOnly virus (V) + Only worm (W) + Both (B) = 250.\n\nWe know W = 125, B =50. So V + 125 +50 =250. So V = 75. \n\nSo the number of files only infected by virus is 75. \n\nBut the question is asking how many files were NOT infected by a worm. So those are the files that are only virus.

Let me calculate that: 50% of 250 is 125. So V = 125.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, 50% were not infected by a virus. So the number of files not infected by a virus is 50% of 250, which is 125.

So those 125 files are infected by worm only. Wait, but wait a second, the problem also says that the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both. So let me define some variables.\n\nLet me let B be the number of files infected by both virus and worm. So, the number of files infected only by worm is 2.5 * B.\n\nSo, let's think about the total number of files. The total is the sum of:\n\n- Only virus: V_only = V - B (since V includes both only virus and both)\n- Only worm: W_only = 2.5 * B\n- Both: B\n\nAnd the total is 250.

So the number of files not infected by virus is 125. Since all files are infected by either virus or worm or both, these 125 files must be those infected only by worm. Because if a file is not infected by virus, it can't be in the virus set, so it must be in the worm set, but not in both.

So B is 50.\n\nNow, since W_only is 125, and B is 50, then the total number of files infected by worm is W = W_only + B = 125 + 50 = 175.\n\nBut wait, I can also compute V. V is the number of files infected by virus, which is 125. Because 50% of 250 is 125. So V = 125.\n\nWait, but using inclusion-exclusion, T = V + W - B.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: 250 = 125 + 175 - B.\n\nWait, let me compute 125 + 175: that's 300. So 250 = 300 - B \u2192 B = 300 - 250 = 50. Which matches what we found earlier.\n\nSo now, the question is asking how many files were NOT infected by a worm. Wait, no. Wait, the question is, how many were NOT infected by a worm. But wait, all files are infected by either virus or worm or both.
