      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about Shweta riding her bike. Let me see, she rides at 10 km per hour. But wait, every time she covers 15 km, she stops for 10 minutes to rest. And the question is asking how many hours she'll take to cover 100 km. Hmm, I need to calculate the total time including her rest periods.\n\nLet me break this down. First, her speed is 10 km/h. So normally, without any stops, the time taken would be total distance divided by speed. For 100 km, that's 100 /10 = 10 hours. But wait, she takes rests every 15 km. So I need to figure out how many rest stops she makes during this 100 km journey.\n\nSo, how many 15 km segments are there in 100 km? Let's see, 100 divided by 15 is about 6.666. But wait, she rests after every 15 km, so the number of stops depends on how many times she completes that 15 km. So after each 15 km, she stops. Except maybe the last one, because if she completes the 100 km exactly, she doesn't need to stop after.\n\nLet me think. If she goes 15 km, stops. Then another 15, stops. How many times does she do this? Let's see: 15 *6 =90 km. So after 6 segments of 15 km, she's at 90 km. Then she has another 10 km to go to reach 100. So she would have made 6 stops, because each 15 km after that first one would trigger a stop.\n\nWait, no. Because after the first 15 km, she stops. Then another 15, another stop, and so on. So for 6 times she does 15 km, she would have 6 stops, right? Because the first 15 km leads to a stop, the next leads to another, and so on.\n\nWait, no. Let's think again. Suppose she starts, goes 15 km, stops. Then another 15, stops again. So each 15 km after the initial one is a stop. So the number of stops is equal to the number of 15 km segments she completes before the last segment.\n\nSo the total distance is 100 km. Each segment is 15 km. So the number of full 15 km segments is 6 (since 6*15=90). Then she has 10 km left. So she would have taken a rest after each of the first 6 segments, but not after the last 10 km, because she doesn't reach another 15 km.\n\nSo number of stops is 6. Each stop is 10 minutes, so total rest time is 6 * 10 =60 minutes, which is 1 hour.\n\nNow, the time she spends riding. Each 15 km takes how long? At 10 km/h, time is distance/speed. So 15/10 =1.5 hours per segment. For 6 segments, that's 6 *1.5 =9 hours.\n\nThen the last 10 km: time is 10/10=1 hour.\n\nSo total riding time is 9 +1=10 hours. Plus the rest time of 1 hour. So total time is 11 hours.\n\nWait, but let me check. So 6 segments of 15 km each: 6 *15=90 km. Then 10 km more. So 6 stops after each 15 km, but not after the last 10 km.\n\nSo riding time: 6 segments of 15 km take 6*1.5 =9 hours. Then 10 km takes 1 hour. So riding is 10 hours. Plus 6 stops, each 10 minutes, so 6*10=60 minutes=1 hour. So total is 10+1=11 hours. That would be option C.\n\nWait, but another way to calculate. Let me see: total distance is 100 km. She rides 15 km, stops, so for each 15 km, she spends 1.5 hours riding, and 10 minutes resting. So per 15 km, it's 1.5 + 0.166666... hours? Wait, 10 minutes is 1/6 of an hour, which is approximately 0.1667 hours.\n\nSo per 15 km, time is 1.5 + 1/6 hours. Let me compute that: 1.5 is 3/2, which is 9/6. So 9/6 +1/6 =10/6 =5/3 hours per 15 km.\n\nHow many such segments? For 100 km, as before, 6 full segments (90 km) and 10 km left.\n\nSo 6 segments: 6*(5/3) =10 hours. Then the last 10 km: 1 hour. So total time is 10+1=11 hours. That's the same as before.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me think about the 6 segments. Each 15 km is a segment, and each has a stop. So 6 segments: 6 stops. Each stop is 10 minutes. So 6 *10=60 mins=1 hour. The riding time for 6*15=90 km is 90/10=9 hours. Then the last 10 km: 1 hour. So total riding time 10 hours, plus rest 1 hour: total 11.\n\nSo the correct answer is C)11 hours.\n",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, her riding speed is 10 km per hour. Without any stops, the time she would take is just the total distance divided by her speed. But wait, she's stopping every 15 km for 10 minutes. So I can't just do 100 divided by 10 because the stops add extra time.\n\nHmm, how many rest stops will she make? Let's see. She stops after every 15 km. So the first 15 km, then another 15, and so on. But wait, when she reaches exactly 100 km, does she stop again? Or does she stop only when she completes a 15 km segment before reaching the destination?\n\nLet me think. She's stopping at the end of every 15 km. So for 100 km, how many 15 km segments are there? Let's divide 100 by 15. 15 times 6 is 90, and 15*7 is 105 which is over 100. So she completes 6 full 15 km segments, which brings her to 90 km. Then she has 10 km left to go. So after the 6th segment (90 km), she would take a rest. Then she rides the last 10 km without stopping again because she's already reached her destination.\n\nWait, no. Wait, she stops at the end of each 15 km. So after every 15 km, she stops. So after 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 km, she stops. So after 90 km, she's done her 6th stop. Then she rides the next 10 km to reach 100, so she doesn't stop after that.\n\nSo how many stops? Each 15 km segment leads to a stop, except the last one if it doesn't reach another 15 km. So for 100 km, the number of stops is 6. Because she stops after 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90. That's six stops. Each stop is 10 minutes, which is 1/6 of an hour.\n\nWait, no. Let's count. From 0 to 15: she stops once. Then 15 to 30: another stop. So for 90 km, that's 6 stops, because 15*6=90. Then she doesn't stop after 90, because she's about to go 10 more km. So yes, 6 stops.\n\nEach stop is 10 minutes. So total rest time is 6 * 10 minutes = 60 minutes, which is 1 hour.\n\nNow, the time she spends riding. Let's calculate the riding time. She covers 100 km at 10 km/h. So without stops, that would be 100 / 10 = 10 hours. But we have to add the rest time.\n\nWait, no. Wait, because she doesn't ride continuously. She rides in segments of 15 km, then stops. So each 15 km takes how long?\n\nHer speed is 10 km/h. Time = distance/speed. So 15 km / 10 km/h = 1.5 hours per segment. So each 15 km takes 1.5 hours, and then a 10-minute stop.\n\nBut wait, she only stops after completing each 15 km. So for each 15 km, the time is 1.5 hours plus 10 minutes. But wait, no. The time for the ride is 1.5 hours, then she stops for 10 minutes. So for each 15 km, the total time is 1.5 h + 10 min. But the last segment (10 km) doesn't have a stop.\n\nSo let's structure this:\n\nNumber of 15 km segments: 6. Because 6*15=90, then 10 km left.\n\nEach of those 6 segments: ride time 1.5 h, stop 10 min.\n\nThen the last 10 km: ride time is 10/10 = 1 hour, no stop.\n\nSo total riding time: 6*(1.5 h) + 1 h = 9 +1 = 10 h.\n\nTotal stop time: 6*(10 min) = 60 min = 1 h.\n\nSo total time is 10 h + 1 h = 11 h.\n\nWait, but let me check. Let me compute each segment's time including the stop, except the last ride.\n\nEach of the first 6 segments: 15 km ride + 10 min stop. So 6 segments would be 6*(1.5 h + 1/6 h) ?\n\nWait, no, because the stop comes after the ride. So each segment (except the last one) takes 1.5 h riding plus 10 min stop.\n\nSo for the first 6 segments (90 km), the time per segment is 1.5 h ride + 10 min stop. Then the last 10 km is 1 h ride, no stop.\n\nSo total time for 6 segments: 6*(1.5 + 1/6) hours.\n\nWait, 10 minutes is 1/6 of an hour (since 60 min = 1 h). So 1.5 h is 3/2 h. Let me compute 6*(3/2 + 1/6) = 6*( (9/6)+(1/6) ) = 6*(10/6) = 6*(5/3) )= 10 h.\n\nThen add the last 10 km ride time of 1 h.\n\nSo total time is 10 h + 1 h = 11 h.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So the total time is 11 hours.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 11 hours.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine how long Shweta will take to cover 100 km, we need to account for both her riding time and her rest stops. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Riding Speed and Rest Stops**:  \n   Shweta rides at a speed of 10 km/h and stops for 10 minutes (1/6 of an hour) after every 15 km.\n\n2. **Number of Rest Stops**:  \n   For 100 km, Shweta completes 6 full segments of 15 km each (15 \u00d7 6 = 90 km). After each of these segments, she takes a 10-minute break. Thus, she makes 6 rest stops.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out how long Shweta will take to cover 100 km, considering her speed and rest stops. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, her riding speed is 10 km per hour. Without any stops, the time she would take is just the total distance divided by her speed. But wait, she's stopping every 15 km for 10 minutes. So I can't just do 100 divided by 10 because the stops add extra time.\n\nHmm, how many rest stops will she make? Let's see. She stops after every 15 km. So the first 15 km, then another 15, and so on. But wait, when she reaches exactly 100 km, does she stop again? Or does she stop only when she completes a 15 km segment before reaching the destination?\n\nLet me think. She's stopping at the end of every 15 km. So for 100 km, how many 15 km segments are there? Let's divide 100 by 15. 15 times 6 is 90, and 15*7 is 105 which is over 100. So she completes 6 full 15 km segments, which brings her to 90 km. Then she has 10 km left to go. So after the 6th segment (90 km), she would take a rest. Then she rides the last 10 km without stopping again because she's already reached her destination.\n\nWait, no. Wait, she stops at the end of each 15 km. So after every 15 km, she stops. So after 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 km, she stops. So after 90 km, she's done her 6th stop. Then she rides the next 10 km to reach 100, so she doesn't stop after that.\n\nSo how many stops? Each 15 km segment leads to a stop, except the last one if it doesn't reach another 15 km. So for 100 km, the number of stops is 6. Because she stops after 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90. That's six stops. Each stop is 10 minutes, which is 1/6 of an hour.\n\nWait, no. Let's count. From 0 to 15: she stops once. Then 15 to 30: another stop. So for 90 km, that's 6 stops, because 15*6=90. Then she doesn't stop after 90, because she's about to go 10 more km. So yes, 6 stops.\n\nEach stop is 10 minutes. So total rest time is 6 * 10 minutes = 60 minutes, which is 1 hour.\n\nNow, the time she spends riding. Let's calculate the riding time. She covers 100 km at 10 km/h. So without stops, that would be 100 / 10 = 10 hours. But we have to add the rest time.\n\nWait, no. Wait, because she doesn't ride continuously. She rides in segments of 15 km, then stops. So each 15 km takes how long?\n\nHer speed is 10 km/h. Time = distance/speed. So 15 km / 10 km/h = 1.5 hours per segment. So each 15 km takes 1.5 hours, and then a 10-minute stop.\n\nBut wait, she only stops after completing each 15 km. So for each 15 km, the time is 1.5 hours plus 10 minutes. But wait, no. The time for the ride is 1.5 hours, then she stops for 10 minutes. So for each 15 km, the total time is 1.5 h + 10 min. But the last segment (10 km) doesn't have a stop.\n\nSo let's structure this:\n\nNumber of 15 km segments: 6. Because 6*15=90, then 10 km left.\n\nEach of those 6 segments: ride time 1.5 h, stop 10 min.\n\nThen the last 10 km: ride time is 10/10 = 1 hour, no stop.\n\nSo total riding time: 6*(1.5 h) + 1 h = 9 +1 = 10 h.\n\nTotal stop time: 6*(10 min) = 60 min = 1 h.\n\nSo total time is 10 h + 1 h = 11 h.\n\nWait, but let me check. Let me compute each segment's time including the stop, except the last ride.\n\nEach of the first 6 segments: 15 km ride + 10 min stop. So 6 segments would be 6*(1.5 h + 1/6 h) ?\n\nWait, no, because the stop comes after the ride. So each segment (except the last one) takes 1.5 h riding plus 10 min stop.\n\nSo for the first 6 segments (90 km), the time per segment is 1.5 h ride + 10 min stop. Then the last 10 km is 1 h ride, no stop.\n\nSo total time for 6 segments: 6*(1.5 + 1/6) hours.\n\nWait, 10 minutes is 1/6 of an hour (since 60 min = 1 h). So 1.5 h is 3/2 h. Let me compute 6*(3/2 + 1/6) = 6*( (9/6)+(1/6) ) = 6*(10/6) = 6*(5/3) )= 10 h.\n\nThen add the last 10 km ride time of 1 h.\n\nSo total time is 10 h + 1 h = 11 h.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So the total time is 11 hours.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 11 hours.\n\n\nTo determine how long Shweta will take to cover 100 km, we need to account for both her riding time and her rest stops. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Riding Speed and Rest Stops**:  \n   Shweta rides at a speed of 10 km/h and stops for 10 minutes (1/6 of an hour) after every 15 km.\n\n2. **Number of Rest Stops**:  \n   For 100 km, Shweta completes 6 full segments of 15 km each (15 \u00d7 6 = 90 km). After each of these segments, she takes a 10-minute break. Thus, she makes 6 rest stops. After the 90 km mark, she rides the remaining 10 km without stopping.\n\n3. **Total Rest Time**:  \n   Each rest stop is 10 minutes, so the total rest time is:  \n   \\[\n   6 \\times 10 \\, \\text{minutes} = 60 \\, \\text{minutes} = 1 \\, \\text{hour}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Riding Time**:  \n   - For the first 90 km (6 segments of 15 km each), the riding time per segment is:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{15 \\, \\text{km}}{10 \\, \\text{km/h}} = 1.5 \\, \\text{hours}.\n     \\]  \n     Total riding time for 90 km:  \n     \\[\n     6 \\times 1.5 \\, \\text{hours} = 9 \\, \\text{hours}.\n     \\]  \n   - For the final 10 km, the riding time is:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{10 \\, \\text{km}}{10 \\, \\text{km/h}} = 1 \\, \\text{hour}.\n     \\]  \n     Total riding time:  \n     \\[\n     9 \\, \\text{hours} + 1 \\, \\text{hour} = 10 \\, \\text{hours}.\n     \\]\n\n5. **Total Time**:  \n   Adding the riding time and rest time:  \n   \\[\n   10 \\, \\text{hours} + 1 \\, \\text{hour} = 11 \\, \\text{hours}.\n   \\]\n\nThus, Shweta will take a total of **11 hours** to cover 100 km. \n\nAnswer: C",

The key details are her speed and her rest stops. I need to figure out how long it'll take her to cover 100 km. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, her speed is 10 km per hour. That's straightforward. But she stops for 10 minutes every time she covers 15 km. Hmm, so after every 15 km, she rests for 10 minutes. I need to calculate the total time, including these rest periods.\n\nWait, let's think about how many times she'll stop. If she's going 100 km, how many 15 km segments are there? Let me calculate 100 divided by 15. 15 times 6 is 90, so 6 segments would cover 90 km. Then the next segment would be 10 km. So she would have completed 6 full 15 km parts, and then a remaining 10 km. But wait, does she stop after the last segment? Because she's done the full 100 km. So after the 6th segment (90 km), she stops once, and then she goes the remaining 10 km without stopping because she's reached her destination.\n\nWait, no. Wait. Let me think again. The problem says she stops at the end of every 15 km. So each time she completes 15 km, she stops. So for 100 km, how many 15 km segments are there?\n\nLet me compute 100 divided by 15. 15*6=90, 15*7=105 which is over 100. So she will have 6 full segments of 15 km each, totaling 90 km, and then a remaining 10 km. So she will stop after each of the first 6 segments, and then after the 10 km, she's done, so no stop.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no. Because the 10 km is the 7th segment, but it's only 10 km, so she doesn't complete a full 15 km. So she doesn't stop after that. So the number of stops is 6.\n\nEach stop is 10 minutes, so 6 stops * 10 minutes = 60 minutes, which is 1 hour.\n\nNow, the time she spends riding. Let's calculate the total riding time without stops. She travels 100 km at 10 km/h. Time = distance / speed. So 100 / 10 = 10 hours.\n\nWait, but that's without considering the stops. So the total time is riding time plus stop time. So 10 hours riding plus 1 hour stopping = 11 hours.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's think of it step by step.\n\nEach 15 km segment takes her 15/10 = 1.5 hours. Then she stops for 10 minutes, which is 1/6 of an hour. So for each 15 km, it's 1.5 hours riding plus 1/6 hour rest. But wait, the last segment doesn't require a rest because she's done.\n\nSo for 6 segments, each 15 km, she has 6*(1.5 + 1/6) hours. Wait, no. Because she stops after each 15 km, including the 6th. So after the 6th, she stops, then rides the 10 km. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to model each segment:\n\nSegment 1: 15 km. Time: 1.5 hours. Then rest 10 minutes.\nSegment 2: 15 km. Time: 1.5. Rest.\n... up to segment 6: 15 km. Time:1.5. Rest.\nThen, segment 7: 10 km. Time: 1 hour. No rest.\n\nSo total riding time is 6*(1.5) + 1.0 = 9 + 1 = 10 hours.\n\nTotal rest time is 6*(10 minutes) = 60 minutes = 1 hour.\n\nSo total time is 10 + 1 = 11 hours.\n\nSo the answer should be 11 hours, which is option C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the total distance and the number of stops differently.\n\nWait another approach: The total distance is 100 km. The number of 15 km intervals is 6 full ones (90 km), with 10 km left. Each 15 km requires a stop, so 6 stops. Each stop is 10 minutes.\n\nSo time riding: 100 km / 10 km/h = 10 hours.\n\nTime resting: 6 * 10 minutes = 60 minutes = 1 hour.\n\nTotal: 11 hours. So option C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Shweta riding her bike. Hmm, let's read it carefully. She rides at 10 km per hour, but every 15 km she stops for 10 minutes to rest. I need to figure out how long it'll take her to cover 100 km. The options are from 9 to 13 hours, so I'll have to calculate step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should break down the journey into segments where she rides and then rests. She stops after every 15 km. So, how many such segments are in 100 km? Let me see: 100 divided by 15. That's about 6.666... So she'll have 6 full segments of 15 km each, and then a remaining part. Wait, wait. Let me think again. Because after 6 segments, she's done 90 km, right? Then the last 10 km she doesn't need to stop because she's reached the target. So she only stops after every 15 km except the last part.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. How many times does she stop? Let me think: for each 15 km, she stops once. But when she reaches 100 km, she doesn't stop. So how many 15 km intervals are there in 100 km? Let's calculate 100 divided by 15. That's approximately 6.666, which means she completes 6 full intervals (each 15 km) and then a partial interval of 10 km. So she stops after each of those 6 intervals, right? So she has 6 rest stops.\n\nWait, let me make sure. Let's say she starts riding, goes 15 km, stops. Then another 15, stops. Repeats this 6 times, covering 90 km, then goes the remaining 10 km. So she only stops 6 times, each time taking 10 minutes. So that's 6 * 10 minutes of rest.\n\nNow, the time she spends riding. For each 15 km, she rides at 10 km/h. Time is distance over speed, so 15 km / 10 km/h = 1.5 hours per segment. She has 6 such segments, so 6 * 1.5 hours. Let's calculate that: 6 * 1.5 = 9 hours. Then she has the last 10 km to ride. Time for that is 10 km / 10 km/h = 1 hour. So total riding time is 9 + 1 = 10 hours.\n\nThen add the rest time: 6 stops * 10 minutes each. 6 * 10 = 60 minutes. Which is 1 hour. So total time is 10 hours riding + 1 hour resting = 11 hours. So the answer would be 11 hours, which is option C.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something. Does she stop after the last 15 km before the final 10 km? So after 90 km, she stops for 10 minutes, then rides the remaining 10 km. So yes, she stops 6 times. So 6 times 10 minutes is 60 minutes, which is 1 hour. So riding time is 6*1.5 +1 =10 hours. Total time 11.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach: calculate the time taken for each 15 km including rest, except the last part. So for each 15 km, she spends 1.5 hours riding plus 10 minutes resting. So each 15 km takes 1.75 hours. How many such intervals? 6. So 6 *1.75 = 10.5 hours. Then the last 10 km takes 1 hour. So total 11.5 hours. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous calculation.\n\nWait, wait, no. Because the last 10 km is part of the seventh segment, but she doesn't stop after it. So maybe the approach is wrong.\n\nLet me think again. Let's model each segment step by step.\n\nShe starts at 0 km. Rides 15 km in 1.5 hours. Then rests 10 minutes. So after first segment: 15 km, time 1.5 + 0.166666... (10 minutes) = 1.666666... hours.\n\nSecond segment: another 15 km, 1.5 hours, then rest. So after two segments: 30 km, time 3.3333... hours.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model each interval step by step.\n\nNumber of complete 15 km segments: 6, which cover 90 km.\n\nEach of these 6 segments includes riding and resting, except perhaps the last one. Wait, no. She rests after each 15 km. So after 15 km, she rests. After 30 km, she rests. So for 6 segments, 6 rests. So for each 15 km, 1.5 hours riding, plus 10 minutes rest. So 6*(1.5 + 1/6) hours.\n\nWait, 10 minutes is 1/6 of an hour. So each 15 km takes 1.5 + 1/6 = 1.666666... hours.\n\nSo 6 segments: 6 * 1.666666 = 10 hours. Then she has 10 km left, which takes 1 hour. So total time is 10 +1 = 11 hours. So the answer is 11, option C.\n\nAnother way: total distance is 100 km.\n\nNumber of rest stops: she stops after every 15 km except the last segment. So how many times does she reach a multiple of 15 km? Let's see: 15, 30, 45, 60,75,90. So 6 stops. So 6 rests, each 10 minutes. So 6*10=60 minutes=1 hour.\n\nNow, calculate the riding time. She rides 100 km at 10 km/h. So 100/10 =10 hours. But wait, that can't be right because she stops, so the total time is more.\n\nWait, no. Wait, she doesn't ride 100 km non-stop. She rides in segments, each 15 km, then stops. Except the last segment, which is 10 km.\n\nSo the riding time is: 6 segments of 15 km (90 km) and 1 segment of 10 km.\n\nEach 15 km takes 1.5 hours, so 6 *1.5 =9 hours.\n\nThe last 10 km takes 1 hour. So riding time is 10 hours.\n\nThen, rest time is 6 *10 =60 minutes =1 hour.\n\nTotal time: 10 +1=11 hours.\n\nYes, so the correct answer is C) 11 hours.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Shweta riding her bike. Hmm, let's read it carefully. She rides at 10 km per hour, but every 15 km she stops for 10 minutes to rest. I need to figure out how long it'll take her to cover 100 km. The options are from 9 to 13 hours, so I'll have to calculate step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should break down the journey into segments where she rides and then rests. She stops after every 15 km. So, how many such segments are in 100 km? Let me see: 100 divided by 15. That's about 6.666... So she'll have 6 full segments of 15 km each, and then a remaining part. Wait, wait. Let me think again. Because after 6 segments, she's done 90 km, right? Then the last 10 km she doesn't need to stop because she's reached the target. So she only stops after every 15 km except the last part.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. How many times does she stop? Let me think: for each 15 km, she stops once. But when she reaches 100 km, she doesn't stop. So how many 15 km intervals are there in 100 km? Let's calculate 100 divided by 15. That's approximately 6.666, which means she completes 6 full intervals (each 15 km) and then a partial interval of 10 km. So she stops after each of those 6 intervals, right? So she has 6 rest stops.\n\nWait, let me make sure. Let's say she starts riding, goes 15 km, stops. Then another 15, stops. Repeats this 6 times, covering 90 km, then goes the remaining 10 km. So she only stops 6 times, each time taking 10 minutes. So that's 6 * 10 minutes of rest.\n\nNow, the time she spends riding. For each 15 km, she rides at 10 km/h. Time is distance over speed, so 15 km / 10 km/h = 1.5 hours per segment. She has 6 such segments, so 6 * 1.5 hours. Let's calculate that: 6 * 1.5 = 9 hours. Then she has the last 10 km to ride. Time for that is 10 km / 10 km/h = 1 hour. So total riding time is 9 + 1 = 10 hours.\n\nThen add the rest time: 6 stops * 10 minutes each. 6 * 10 = 60 minutes. Which is 1 hour. So total time is 10 hours riding + 1 hour resting = 11 hours. So the answer would be 11 hours, which is option C.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something. Does she stop after the last 15 km before the final 10 km? So after 90 km, she stops for 10 minutes, then rides the remaining 10 km. So yes, she stops 6 times. So 6 times 10 minutes is 60 minutes, which is 1 hour. So riding time is 6*1.5 +1 =10 hours. Total time 11.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach: calculate the time taken for each 15 km including rest, except the last part. So for each 15 km, she spends 1.5 hours riding plus 10 minutes resting. So each 15 km takes 1.75 hours. How many such intervals? 6. So 6 *1.75 = 10.5 hours. Then the last 10 km takes 1 hour. So total 11.5 hours. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous calculation.\n\nWait, wait, no. Because the last 10 km is part of the seventh segment, but she doesn't stop after it. So maybe the approach is wrong.\n\nLet me think again. Let's model each segment step by step.\n\nShe starts at 0 km. Rides 15 km in 1.5 hours. Then rests 10 minutes. So after first segment: 15 km, time 1.5 + 0.166666... (10 minutes) = 1.666666... hours.\n\nSecond segment: another 15 km, 1.5 hours, then rest. So after two segments: 30 km, time 3.3333... hours.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model each interval step by step.\n\nNumber of complete 15 km segments: 6, which cover 90 km.\n\nEach of these 6 segments includes riding and resting, except perhaps the last one. Wait, no. She rests after each 15 km. So after 15 km, she rests. After 30 km, she rests. So for 6 segments, 6 rests. So for each 15 km, 1.5 hours riding, plus 10 minutes rest. So 6*(1.5 + 1/6) hours.\n\nWait, 10 minutes is 1/6 of an hour. So each 15 km takes 1.5 + 1/6 = 1.666666... hours.\n\nSo 6 segments: 6 * 1.666666 = 10 hours. Then she has 10 km left, which takes 1 hour. So total time is 10 +1 = 11 hours. So the answer is 11, option C.\n\nAnother way: total distance is 100 km.\n\nNumber of rest stops: she stops after every 15 km except the last segment. So how many times does she reach a multiple of 15 km? Let's see: 15, 30, 45, 60,75,90. So 6 stops. So 6 rests, each 10 minutes. So 6*10=60 minutes=1 hour.\n\nNow, calculate the riding time. She rides 100 km at 10 km/h. So 100/10 =10 hours. But wait, that can't be right because she stops, so the total time is more.\n\nWait, no. Wait, she doesn't ride 100 km non-stop. She rides in segments, each 15 km, then stops. Except the last segment, which is 10 km.\n\nSo the riding time is: 6 segments of 15 km (90 km) and 1 segment of 10 km.\n\nEach 15 km takes 1.5 hours, so 6 *1.5 =9 hours.\n\nThe last 10 km takes 1 hour. So riding time is 10 hours.\n\nThen, rest time is 6 *10 =60 minutes =1 hour.\n\nTotal time: 10 +1=11 hours.\n\nYes, so the correct answer is C) 11 hours.\n\n\nTo determine how long Shweta will take to cover 100 km, we break her journey into segments of 15 km each, with a 10-minute rest after every 15 km. \n\n1. **Number of Rest Stops**:  \n   Shweta stops after every 15 km, but she does not stop after the final 10 km. Since she completes 6 segments of 15 km (covering 90 km), she rests 6 times. Each rest stop is 10 minutes, so total rest time is:  \n   \\[\n   6 \\times 10 \\, \\text{minutes} = 60 \\, \\text{minutes} = 1 \\, \\text{hour}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Riding Time**:  \n   - For each 15 km segment, the time taken is:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{15 \\, \\text{km}}{10 \\, \\text{km/h}} = 1.5 \\, \\text{hours}.\n     \\]  \n     For 6 such segments (90 km):  \n     \\[\n     6 \\times 1.5 \\, \\text{hours} = 9 \\, \\text{hours}.\n     \\]  \n   - For the final 10 km segment:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{10 \\, \\text{km}}{10 \\, \\text{km/h}} = 1 \\, \\text{hour}.\n     \\]  \n     Total riding time is:  \n     \\[\n     9 \\, \\text{hours} + 1 \\, \\text{hour} = 10 \\, \\text{hours}.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Total Time**:  \n   Adding the riding time and rest time:  \n   \\[\n   10 \\, \\text{hours} + 1 \\, \\text{hour} = 11 \\, \\text{hours}.\n   \\]\n\nThus, Shweta will take **11 hours** to cover 100 km. \n\nAnswer: C",

But wait, after the last segment, does she need to rest again? Let's think. If she's done with the 100 km, she doesn't need to rest anymore. So she rests after each 15 km except the last one.

So if she has 6 full 15 km parts, she would rest after each, but when she's done the 6th 15 km, she has only 10 km left. So she rides that 10 km without resting after it. So the number of rest stops is 6, right? Because after each 15 km (including the 6th), she rests, but the 7th segment is only 10 km and doesn't require a rest after.\n\nSo each rest is 10 minutes.

Hmm, she rides at 10 km per hour, but every 15 km, she stops for 10 minutes to rest. I need to find out how long it takes her to cover 100 km.\n\nAlright, first, I'll think about her riding time and the rest stops. So she goes 15 km, then rests for 10 minutes. But wait, after every 15 km she stops. So I need to figure out how many such 15 km segments there are in 100 km. Let me do the division: 100 divided by 15. That's approximately 6.666... So that means she completes 6 full 15 km segments and then a partial segment for the remaining distance.\n\nWait, but each time she completes a 15 km segment, she takes a 10-minute break. So if she does 6 full segments, how many breaks does she take? Well, after each segment except maybe the last one, she takes a break. Because after the last segment, she doesn't need to rest anymore since she's reached her destination. So for 6 segments, she would have 5 breaks. Or wait, no. Let me think again. She starts riding, goes 15 km, rests for 10 mins. Then another 15, rests, and so on. So for each 15 km except the last, she rests. So the number of rest stops is equal to the number of times she completes 15 km minus one. Because after the last 15 km, she doesn't rest.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: let's calculate how many 15 km segments she has in 100 km. 100 divided by 15 is 6 with a remainder. 6*15=90, so she has 90 km covered in 6 segments, each followed by a rest, except maybe the last one. Wait, no, because 6 segments would be 90 km. Then she has 10 km left. So she rides the 10 km without taking a break after that. So she has 6 segments of 15 km, each followed by a rest except the last one. Wait, no: the first 6 segments would be 6*15=90 km. Then she does another 10 km, which is part of a 7th segment but not a full 15. So she doesn't rest after that 10 km.\n\nWait, maybe I should model it as: every time she completes a 15 km, she rests. So for the 100 km, she has:\n\nFirst 15 km: time taken is (15/10) hours = 1.5 hours. Then she rests for 10 mins (which is 1/6 hours). Then the next 15 km, same thing. But how many times does she do this?\n\nWait, let's calculate how many times she completes 15 km. 100 /15 = 6.666..., so 6 full 15 km segments, and then 10 km. So the first 6 segments each have a rest, but the 7th segment (which is only 10 km) doesn't have a rest.\n\nWait, no. Because each 15 km she completes, she rests. So after the 1st 15 km, rest. After the 2nd 15, rest. Up to the 6th 15, she rests. Then she does the 7th (10 km), and no rest after. So the number of rest periods is 6.\n\nWait, no, wait. If she does 6 full 15 km segments, that's 90 km, and then 10 km. So she took a rest after each of the first 6 segments. So 6 rest periods. Because after each 15 km, she rests, including after the 6th, but then she goes for the 10 km, which doesn't require a rest.\n\nSo total riding time is the time for each 15 km segment plus the time for the last 10 km.\n\nEach 15 km takes 15/10 = 1.5 hours. She does 6 of these, so 6 * 1.5 = 9 hours. Then the last 10 km takes 10/10=1 hour. So total riding time is 9 + 1 = 10 hours.\n\nThe rest periods: 6 rests, each 10 minutes. 6 * 10 = 60 minutes, which is 1 hour.\n\nSo total time is riding time + rest time: 10 +1 =11 hours. Wait, but wait, let me make sure.\n\nWait, let me recheck. She rides 15 km: 1.5 hours, rests 10 min. So for each 15 km segment except the last, she rests. Wait, no. She rests after each 15 km, but the 10 km is not a 15 km segment, so she doesn't rest after that.\n\nWait, the 6 segments of 15 km: after each, she rests. So that's 6 rests. Because after 1st, 2nd,..., 6th 15 km, she rests. Then she does the 10 km, no rest.\n\nSo 6 rests.\n\nSo total time:\n\nRiding time: 6*(15/10) + (10/10) = 6*1.5 +1 = 9+1=10 hours.\n\nRest time: 6*(10 min) = 60 min = 1 hour.\n\nTotal time: 11 hours. So the answer should be C) 11 hours.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let's model it step by step:\n\nSegment 1: 15 km, time=1.5h, rest=0.1667h (10min). So after 1.5h, rest 10 min.\n\nSegment 2: another 1.5h, rest 10 min.\n\nThis repeats for 6 segments:\n\nSo 6 segments: 6 * (1.5h + 0.1667h) )= 6*(1.6667) = 10 hours? Wait, no. Wait, no, the 6 segments each have a ride time and a rest. Except the last segment doesn't have a rest if it's the last. Wait, no, she does 6 segments of 15 km, each followed by a rest. But wait, 6 segments of 15 km make 90 km, so after that, she has 10 km left. So she rides 15 km, rests, then another 15, rests, etc., until she's done 6 times, then she has 10 km left, which she rides without resting.\n\nSo the total time is:\n\nFor each of the 6 segments: ride 1.5h, rest 0.1667h.\n\nThen ride 10 km: 1h.\n\nSo 6*(1.5 + 0.1667) +1.\n\nCompute 1.5 + 0.1667 = 1.6667 hours.\n\n6 * 1.6667 = 10 hours.\n\nThen add the last 1h: 10 +1=11h.\n\nYes, that's correct. So total time is 11 hours, option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Shweta riding her bike. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, she rides at 10 km per hour, but every 15 km, she stops for 10 minutes to rest. I need to find out how long it takes her to cover 100 km.\n\nAlright, first, I'll think about her riding time and the rest stops. So she goes 15 km, then rests for 10 minutes. But wait, after every 15 km she stops. So I need to figure out how many such 15 km segments there are in 100 km. Let me do the division: 100 divided by 15. That's approximately 6.666... So that means she completes 6 full 15 km segments and then a partial segment for the remaining distance.\n\nWait, but each time she completes a 15 km segment, she takes a 10-minute break. So if she does 6 full segments, how many breaks does she take? Well, after each segment except maybe the last one, she takes a break. Because after the last segment, she doesn't need to rest anymore since she's reached her destination. So for 6 segments, she would have 5 breaks. Or wait, no. Let me think again. She starts riding, goes 15 km, rests for 10 mins. Then another 15, rests, and so on. So for each 15 km except the last, she rests. So the number of rest stops is equal to the number of times she completes 15 km minus one. Because after the last 15 km, she doesn't rest.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: let's calculate how many 15 km segments she has in 100 km. 100 divided by 15 is 6 with a remainder. 6*15=90, so she has 90 km covered in 6 segments, each followed by a rest, except maybe the last one. Wait, no, because 6 segments would be 90 km. Then she has 10 km left. So she rides the 10 km without taking a break after that. So she has 6 segments of 15 km, each followed by a rest except the last one. Wait, no: the first 6 segments would be 6*15=90 km. Then she does another 10 km, which is part of a 7th segment but not a full 15. So she doesn't rest after that 10 km.\n\nWait, maybe I should model it as: every time she completes a 15 km, she rests. So for the 100 km, she has:\n\nFirst 15 km: time taken is (15/10) hours = 1.5 hours. Then she rests for 10 mins (which is 1/6 hours). Then the next 15 km, same thing. But how many times does she do this?\n\nWait, let's calculate how many times she completes 15 km. 100 /15 = 6.666..., so 6 full 15 km segments, and then 10 km. So the first 6 segments each have a rest, but the 7th segment (which is only 10 km) doesn't have a rest.\n\nWait, no. Because each 15 km she completes, she rests. So after the 1st 15 km, rest. After the 2nd 15, rest. Up to the 6th 15, she rests. Then she does the 7th (10 km), and no rest after. So the number of rest periods is 6.\n\nWait, no, wait. If she does 6 full 15 km segments, that's 90 km, and then 10 km. So she took a rest after each of the first 6 segments. So 6 rest periods. Because after each 15 km, she rests, including after the 6th, but then she goes for the 10 km, which doesn't require a rest.\n\nSo total riding time is the time for each 15 km segment plus the time for the last 10 km.\n\nEach 15 km takes 15/10 = 1.5 hours. She does 6 of these, so 6 * 1.5 = 9 hours. Then the last 10 km takes 10/10=1 hour. So total riding time is 9 + 1 = 10 hours.\n\nThe rest periods: 6 rests, each 10 minutes. 6 * 10 = 60 minutes, which is 1 hour.\n\nSo total time is riding time + rest time: 10 +1 =11 hours. Wait, but wait, let me make sure.\n\nWait, let me recheck. She rides 15 km: 1.5 hours, rests 10 min. So for each 15 km segment except the last, she rests. Wait, no. She rests after each 15 km, but the 10 km is not a 15 km segment, so she doesn't rest after that.\n\nWait, the 6 segments of 15 km: after each, she rests. So that's 6 rests. Because after 1st, 2nd,..., 6th 15 km, she rests. Then she does the 10 km, no rest.\n\nSo 6 rests.\n\nSo total time:\n\nRiding time: 6*(15/10) + (10/10) = 6*1.5 +1 = 9+1=10 hours.\n\nRest time: 6*(10 min) = 60 min = 1 hour.\n\nTotal time: 11 hours. So the answer should be C) 11 hours.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let's model it step by step:\n\nSegment 1: 15 km, time=1.5h, rest=0.1667h (10min). So after 1.5h, rest 10 min.\n\nSegment 2: another 1.5h, rest 10 min.\n\nThis repeats for 6 segments:\n\nSo 6 segments: 6 * (1.5h + 0.1667h) )= 6*(1.6667) = 10 hours? Wait, no. Wait, no, the 6 segments each have a ride time and a rest. Except the last segment doesn't have a rest if it's the last. Wait, no, she does 6 segments of 15 km, each followed by a rest. But wait, 6 segments of 15 km make 90 km, so after that, she has 10 km left. So she rides 15 km, rests, then another 15, rests, etc., until she's done 6 times, then she has 10 km left, which she rides without resting.\n\nSo the total time is:\n\nFor each of the 6 segments: ride 1.5h, rest 0.1667h.\n\nThen ride 10 km: 1h.\n\nSo 6*(1.5 + 0.1667) +1.\n\nCompute 1.5 + 0.1667 = 1.6667 hours.\n\n6 * 1.6667 = 10 hours.\n\nThen add the last 1h: 10 +1=11h.\n\nYes, that's correct. So total time is 11 hours, option C.\n\n\nTo determine how long Shweta takes to cover 100 km, we analyze her riding and resting pattern. Shweta rides at 10 km/h and stops for 10 minutes (1/6 hours) after every 15 km. \n\n1. **Number of 15 km segments in 100 km**:  \n   Dividing 100 by 15 gives approximately 6.666.

The question is asking how long she'll take to cover 100 km, considering she takes a rest every 15 km. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nSo, Shweta rides at 10 km per hour. That means in one hour, she covers 10 km. But every time she completes 15 km, she stops for 10 minutes. I need to figure out how many rest stops she'll make and then calculate the total time, including those rests.\n\nWait, first, I should probably figure out how many 15 km segments are there in 100 km. Let me divide 100 by 15. 15 times 6 is 90, and 15 times 7 is 105, which is more than 100. So that means she'll have 6 full segments of 15 km each, which adds up to 90 km. Then, she has 10 km left after that.\n\nBut wait, does she take a rest after every 15 km, including the last one? Because if she's done 90 km, which is 6 segments, does she rest again before the final 10 km? Or does she only rest after completing each 15 km, meaning after the 6th segment she doesn't rest anymore because she's about to do the last part?\n\nHmm, the problem says she stops for rest at the end of every 15 km. So after every 15 km, she stops. So after 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 km, she stops. So that's 6 stops. Wait, but when she starts, does she not have a rest at the beginning? No, because she's starting fresh. So she rests 6 times after each 15 km segment, right?\n\nWait, 100 km is more than 6*15, which is 90. So she'll have 6 rests after each 15 km, and then she has 10 km to go after that. So let me structure this.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time she spends riding. She rides 15 km at 10 km/h each time. The time for each 15 km is 15/10 = 1.5 hours. So for each segment, 1.5 hours of riding. Then she rests for 10 minutes, which is 1/6 of an hour.\n\nBut wait, she has 6 such segments before the last 10 km. So the riding time for 6 segments is 6 * 1.5 hours. Let me compute that: 6 * 1.5 is 9 hours. Then the rest time is 6 * 10 minutes, which is 60 minutes, or 1 hour. So total time before the last part is 9 + 1 = 10 hours. Then she has 10 km left. At 10 km/h, that takes 1 hour. So total time is 10 + 1 = 11 hours.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let's think about the number of rest stops. If she completes 15 km, she rests. So after 15 km: 1 rest. After 30 km: 2 rests. So after 90 km, which is 6 segments, she rests 6 times. Then she goes from 90 to 100, which is 10 km. So she doesn't need to rest again after that. So the total riding time is 6*1.5 hours + 1 hour (for the last 10 km). That's 9 + 1 = 10 hours riding. Plus 6 rests, each 10 minutes: 6*(10/60) = 1 hour. So total time is 10 +1=11 hours.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me outline the entire journey:\n\nSegment 1: 15 km \u2192 1.5 hours \u2192 then rest 10 min.\nSegment 2: 15 km \u2192 1.5 \u2192 rest.\n... and so on until segment 6: 15 km \u2192 1.5 hours \u2192 rest 10 min.\nThen, she has 10 km left.\n\nSo for each of the first 6 segments, she rides 1.5 hours and rests 10 min. So total riding time for 6 segments: 6*1.5=9 hours. Rests: 6*10=60 min =1 hour.\n\nThen the last 10 km: 1 hour.\n\nSo total time: 9 +1 +1=11 hours.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 11 hours.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. What if she doesn't take a rest after the last 15 km? Because after the 6th segment, she rests, then she has 10 km to go. So that 10 km is after the rest. So the calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the number of rests. Let's see:\n\nTotal distance: 100 km.\n\nNumber of 15 km segments before 100: 6. Because 6*15=90. So she has 6 rests, each after 15, 30, ...,90 km.\n\nSo 6 rests, 6*10 min =1h.\n\nRiding time: (6*15 +10) = 100 km.\n\nTime for riding: (15*6)/10 + 10/10 = (90/10) + 10/10 =9+1=10h.\n\nTotal time: 10h +1h =11h.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n",
