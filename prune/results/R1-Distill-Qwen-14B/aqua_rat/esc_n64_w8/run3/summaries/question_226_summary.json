So the denominator becomes 10! * 1. So the numerator is 10! and denominator is 10! * 1. So they cancel out, leaving 1.\n\nSo there's only one way to choose all 10 friends.

So the team is 11 people in total, but the question is about the number of choices he has for forming his team. But wait, the problem states that he has 10 friends who would like to participate. So he's looking to choose 10 people from his 10 friends. Because each friend wants to participate, so each is available.\n\nSo the question is, how many ways can Peter choose 10 people out of his 10 friends. Oh, wait, because if he needs 10 people and he has exactly 10 friends, how many combinations can he make? Because he can't choose more than 10 since that's all he has.\n\nSo in combinatorics, the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n is given by the combination formula, which is n choose k, or C(n, k) = n! / (k! (n-k)!).\n\nIn this case, n is 10 friends, and k is 10, since he needs 10 more people. So it's C(10, 10).\n\nCalculating that: 10! / (10! * (10-10)! ) \u2192 10! / (10! * 0! ). Wait, 0! is 1, right? So the denominator becomes 10! * 1. So the numerator is 10! and denominator is 10! * 1. So they cancel out, leaving 1.\n\nSo there's only one way to choose all 10 friends. Because he has to pick all of them. He can't leave any out since he needs exactly 10 people, and that's all he has available.\n\nSo looking back at the options, the choices are A)0, B)1, C)2, D)3, E)4.\n\nSo the correct answer must be B)1.\n\n\nPeter needs to form a scavenger hunt team by selecting 10 additional people from his 10 friends. Since he must choose all 10 friends to form a team of 10, there is only one way to do this. Using the combination formula, the number of ways to choose 10 people from 10 is:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 10) = \\frac{10!}{10! \\cdot (10-10)!} = \\frac{10!}{10! \\cdot 1} = 1\n\\]\n\nThus, there is only one way for Peter to form his team.\n\nAnswer: B",

Or is it that he already has 10 friends who want to participate, and he wants to choose 10 more? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nWait, the question says Peter wants to find 10 additional people. So he's the one starting the team, and he needs 10 more.

The exact wording is: \"Peter wants to find 10 additional people to form a scavenger hunt team with him.

But wait, the friends available are 10. So he needs 10 more, but he only has 10 friends. So he needs to choose all 10 of his friends.

So the team size is 10, perhaps? Or is the team size 10 people including himself, making it 10 in total, but he's looking for 10 more?\n\nWait, this is a bit confusing. Let's try to parse it again. The first sentence: Peter wants to find 10 additional people to form a scavenger hunt team with him. So, he is part of the team, and he's adding 10 more. So the team will have 11 people: Peter plus 10 others. But he has 10 friends who are willing to join. So he needs 10 more people, but he only has 10 friends available. So he can choose all 10 of his friends, but that would only give him 10 people, but he needs 10 more. Wait, that doesn't add up. Because if he has 10 friends, and he needs 10 additional, he can take all 10, so the team would be 11 people (Peter + 10 friends). But then the question is, how many choices does he have for forming his team?\n\nWait, perhaps the team is just 10 people, and he's one of them. So he needs to choose 9 more. But the problem says he has 10 friends who would like to participate. So perhaps he can choose 9 of them, but the question is, how many ways can he form the team?\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck on the exact team size. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem says: \"Peter wants to find 10 additional people to form a scavenger hunt team with him.\" So Peter is part of the team, and he needs 10 more.

Then he needs to choose 9 more from his 10 friends. So the number of ways would be the combination of 10 friends taken 9 at a time, which is 10 choose 9 = 10.
