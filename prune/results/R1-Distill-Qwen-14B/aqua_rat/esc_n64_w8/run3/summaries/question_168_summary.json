      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about two ants moving towards each other. Hmm, let me think. Ant A is moving at 9 cm per hour and Ant B at 6 cm per hour. The distance between their farms is 75 cm. I need to find out how far Ant A travels before they meet.\n\nWait, right. When two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. So, Ant A's speed is 9 cm/h and Ant B's is 6 cm/h. So together, they're approaching each other at 9 + 6 = 15 cm/h. \n\nBut wait, how does that help me find the distance each travels? Oh right, because the time it takes for them to meet is the same for both. So I can find the time first. The total distance is 75 cm, and since they're moving towards each other, the time until they meet is total distance divided by their combined speed.\n\nSo time = 75 cm / 15 cm/h = 5 hours. Oh, wait, 5 hours? That seems a bit long for ants, but maybe they're really slow or something. Anyway, the problem says the speeds, so that's okay.\n\nOnce I have the time, I can find how far each ant has traveled. For Ant A, distance = speed \u00d7 time. So that's 9 cm/h \u00d7 5 h = 45 cm. So Ant A travels 45 cm. \n\nLooking at the options, option A is 45. So that should be the answer. \n\nWait, just double-checking.

I need to find the distance Ant A travels until they meet.\n\nWait, so they start moving towards each other at the same time, right? So the total distance between them is 75 cm.

Since they start at the same time and meet at the same point, the distance each covers is proportional to their speeds.\n\nSo, the ratio of ant A's speed to ant B's speed is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. The total parts are 3+2=5 parts. The total distance is 75 cm, so each part is 75/5=15 cm. So ant A would cover 3 parts, which is 3*15=45 cm. Same answer, so that confirms it.\n\nSo the correct answer should be A)45.\n\n\nTo determine the distance ant A travels before meeting ant B, we start by calculating their combined speed. Since ant A moves at 9 cm/h and ant B at 6 cm/h, their combined speed is:\n\n\\[\n9 \\, \\text{cm/h} + 6 \\, \\text{cm/h} = 15 \\, \\text{cm/h}.\n\\]\n\nThe total distance between their farms is 75 cm. The time it takes for them to meet is given by dividing the total distance by their combined speed:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Combined Speed}} = \\frac{75 \\, \\text{cm}}{15 \\, \\text{cm/h}} = 5 \\, \\text{hours}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the distance ant A travels in this time. Since ant A's speed is 9 cm/h, the distance it travels is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance of Ant A} = \\text{Speed of Ant A} \\times \\text{Time} = 9 \\, \\text{cm/h} \\times 5 \\, \\text{hours} = 45 \\, \\text{cm}.\n\\]\n\nTo confirm, we can also use the ratio of their speeds. The ratio of ant A's speed to ant B's speed is \\( 9:6 = 3:2 \\). The total parts are \\( 3 + 2 = 5 \\), and each part represents:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{75 \\, \\text{cm}}{5} = 15 \\, \\text{cm}.\n\\]\n\nAnt A covers 3 parts, so the distance it travels is:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 15 \\, \\text{cm} = 45 \\, \\text{cm}.\n\\]\n\nBoth methods confirm that ant A travels 45 cm before meeting ant B. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: A**",

I need to find out how far Ant A travels before they meet.\n\nWait, right. So, when two objects move towards each other, their speeds add up because they're closing the distance between them.
