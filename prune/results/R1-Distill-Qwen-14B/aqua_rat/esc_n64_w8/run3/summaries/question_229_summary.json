      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Q is a positive integer with 5 factors. I need to figure out which of the statements I, II, or III must be true. The options are A to E, each combining some of these statements.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Oh right, if a number Q has a prime factorization of the form p1^a * p2^b * ... pn^k, then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)...(k+1). \n\nSo, since Q has 5 factors, which is a prime number (5 is prime), the product of these (exponents +1) terms must be 5. That means the exponents in the prime factors must multiply to give 5. Since 5 is prime, the only way is for there to be a single term of 5, so the number must be of the form p^4, because 4 +1 is 5. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Let me think again. If the number of factors is 5, which is 5 = 5 \u00d7 1. So the exponents plus one multiply to 5. So the exponents themselves must be 4, because 4+1=5. Or wait, is that right? Or could there be multiple primes?\n\nWait, another approach. If Q has exactly 5 factors, it must be a square of a prime. Because, for example, take a prime p. Its square is p^2, and the factors are 1, p, p^2. Wait, that's 3 factors. Hmm, wait, that can't be right. Wait no, wait, wait. Let me correct that. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, if Q is p^4, then the factors are p^0, p^1, p^2, p^3, p^4. So that's 5 factors. Alternatively, if Q is p^2, then the factors are p^0, p^1, p^2: 3 factors. So that's not enough.\n\nWait, but wait, another possibility. What if the number is the product of two different primes? Like p*q. Then the number of factors is (1+1)(1+1)=4. So that's 4 factors, which is less than 5. So that's not the case. So to get 5 factors, it has to be a single prime raised to the 4th power. Because 4+1=5.\n\nSo, that would mean that statement I is true because Q is the square of a prime number? Wait, no. Wait, statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Wait, if Q is p^4, then it's the square of p^2. Hmm, wait, that's not a prime. Wait, p^4 is (p^2)^2, but p is prime. So Q is the square of p^2, which is a square of a composite number. Wait, no, wait: p is prime, so p^2 is composite, but when you square that, it's p^4. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. But in this case, Q is the square of p^2, which is not a prime. So statement I would be false, but wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the number of factors wrong. Let's double-check. The formula is correct: number of factors is product of (exponents +1). So for Q=p^4, the exponents are 4, so number of factors is 5. That's correct. So Q is the fourth power of a prime number. So statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime number. So II is true. \n\nWhat about statement I? Statement I says Q is the square of a prime number. Well, if Q is p^4, then it's (p^2)^2, which is the square of p^2. But p^2 is not a prime unless p^2 is prime. But p is prime, so p^2 is composite unless p=2? No, 2 squared is 4, which is composite. So p^2 is always composite when p is prime (since p>=2, p^2 >=4). So statement I would be false, because Q is the square of a composite number, not a prime.\n\nWhat about statement III? It says Q is the product of two primes. But Q is p^4, which is p*p*p*p. So that's not the product of two primes. It's the product of four primes, all the same. So statement III is also false.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Another way to get 5 factors? Because 5 is a prime number, the only way the product (a+1)(b+1)... equals 5 is if one of the terms is 5 and the rest are 1. So the only possibility is a single exponent of 4, as I thought before. So Q must be p^4, which is the fourth power of a prime. So statement II is true.\n\nSo looking at the options, which options include only II? Let's check the options.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) I only \u2192 No, because II is correct.\n\nB) III only \u2192 No, because III is incorrect.\n\nC) II only \u2192 Yes, because only II is correct.\n\nD) I and II only \u2192 No, because I is incorrect.\n\nE) I and III only \u2192 No, both I and III are incorrect.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check. I thought that statement I says Q is the square of a prime. But wait, in this case, Q is p^4. So, is p^4 the square of a prime? Well, p is a prime, so p^4 is (p^2)^2, but p^2 is not a prime. So Q is the square of a composite number. So statement I is false. So only II is correct. So the correct answer is option C.\n",

The question is: If Q is a positive integer that has 5 factors, which of the statements I, II, III must be true about Q?\n\nThe options are about whether Q is the square of a prime, the fourth power, or the product of two primes. Hmm, I remember something about the number of factors a number has being related to its prime factorization. Let me try to recall.\n\nWait, right! The formula for the number of factors is based on the exponents in the prime factorization. If a number N can be written as p1^a * p2^b * p3^c..., then the number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc. So, for example, if N is p squared, then it's p^2, so the number of factors is (2+1)=3, which makes sense because the factors are 1, p, p^2.\n\nIn this problem, Q has 5 factors. So (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... =5. Now, 5 is a prime number, so the only way to write 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5*1. So the exponents plus one must multiply to 5. That means there's only one term, because 5 is prime. So the exponents plus one must be 5, meaning the exponent is 4? Wait, wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no. If (a+1)(b+1)...=5, and 5 is prime, the only possible way is that one of the (exponent+1) is 5, and the others are 1. Because if you have more than one term, like 5=5*1, but if you have two primes, for example, then each (exponent+1) would have to be factors of 5. But since 5 is prime, the only possibilities are 5 and 1. So, the only way is that one prime has an exponent of 4 (since 4+1=5), and all other primes (if any) have exponents of 0, meaning they don't appear.\n\nWait, so if Q has a prime factorization with only one prime raised to the 4th power, then the number of factors is 5. So Q is p^4. Or is there another possibility?\n\nWait, no, because 5 can't be broken down into more factors except 5*1, but if there were two primes, then each (exponent+1) would have to be 5 and 1, but that's not possible because exponents can't be negative. So, for two primes, exponents would be 4 and 0, but 0 means the prime isn't present. So, it's impossible to have two primes because that would require exponents of 4 and 0, but then the number is actually just p^4, not a product of two primes.\n\nWait, but let's think again. What if Q is the product of two primes, p and q, each to the first power? Then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1)=4, which is 4 factors, not 5. So that's not enough. So statement III says Q is the product of two primes, which would imply that the number of factors is 4. So III is not correct because Q has 5 factors, not 4.\n\nWait, but then statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Wait, if Q is p squared, then the number of factors is 3 (1, p, p\u00b2). But Q has 5 factors, so that's not possible. So statement I can't be correct either. Hmm, that's conflicting with what I thought earlier.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I made a mistake earlier.

So the exponents are 4, and all others zero. So Q must be p^4. So that's the case.\n\nSo, Q is the fourth power of a prime, right? So statement II is correct, because II says Q is the fourth power of a prime. Then, what about I and III? Statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Well, if Q is p^4, that's (p\u00b2)^2, so it's the square of p squared, but it's also the square of a square. But wait, is it the square of a prime? No. Because p^4 is (p\u00b2)^2, but p is a prime. So p squared is not a prime unless p is 2, but wait, p squared is 4, which is not prime. So statement I is not correct because Q is p^4, which is the square of p squared, but p squared is not a prime. So statement I is false.\n\nStatement III says Q is the product of two primes.

The number of factors of a positive integer is determined by its prime factorization. If \\( Q \\) has a prime factorization of the form \\( p_1^{a} p_2^{b} p_3^{c} \\dots \\), the total number of factors is given by \\( (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)\\dots \\). \n\nSince \\( Q \\) has 5 factors and 5 is a prime number, the only way to express 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is \\( 5 = 5 \\times 1 \\). This implies that \\( Q \\) must be the fourth power of a single prime number (\\( p^4 \\)), as the exponent plus one must equal 5 (\\( 4 + 1 = 5 \\)).\n\nNow, we evaluate the statements:\n\n1. **Statement I: \\( Q \\) is the square of a prime number.**  \n   If \\( Q \\) were the square of a prime number (\\( p^2 \\)), it would have \\( 2 + 1 = 3 \\) factors (1, \\( p \\), \\( p^2 \\)). However, \\( Q \\) has 5 factors, so this statement is false.\n\n2. **Statement II: \\( Q \\) is the fourth power of a prime number.**  \n   As shown earlier, \\( Q \\) must be of the form \\( p^4 \\) to have exactly 5 factors. This statement is true.\n\n3. **Statement III: \\( Q \\) is the product of two prime numbers.**  \n   If \\( Q \\) were the product of two distinct primes (\\( p \\times q \\)), it would have \\( (1+1)(1+1) = 4 \\) factors. Since \\( Q \\) has 5 factors, this statement is false.\n\nThus, only Statement II is correct. The correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: C**",

The question is about a positive integer Q that has exactly 5 factors. I need to figure out which of the statements I, II, or III must be true about Q. The options are A to E, each combining these statements.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Oh right! If a number Q can be expressed as a product of primes raised to their respective exponents, like Q = p1^a * p2^b * p3^c..., then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... and so on for each prime.\n\nSo, in this case, Q has exactly 5 factors. Let me think about what exponents would lead to that. Since 5 is a prime number, the only way to write it as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5*1. So that means the formula (a+1)(b+1)... must equal 5. \n\nLooking at the possible forms, the exponents plus one multiply to 5. So the exponents could be 4 and 0, but wait, exponents can't be negative. Alternatively, maybe only one exponent is present, like 4, because 4+1=5. So that would mean Q is a prime raised to the 4th power.\n\nWait, another possibility: what if it's a product of two primes? Let's see. If Q were the product of two distinct primes, say p and q, then the exponents would be 1 and 1. So the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1) = 4. But 4 is less than 5, so that can't be. Or if one exponent is 4 and the other is 0? But exponents can't be zero in that case because that would mean that prime isn't present.\n\nWait, no, exponents can't be zero because then it's not part of the factorization. So the only way is that Q is a single prime raised to the 4th power. Because if there's more than one prime factor, the product would have more factors. Like, for example, if Q = p^4, then the number of factors is 4+1=5. That makes sense.\n\nSo statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Wait, square is exponent 2. But we have exponent 4. So I is p squared. So statement I is not correct because Q is p^4, which is (p squared)^2. So statement I is false.\n\nStatement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime number. That aligns with what I just thought. So II is true.\n\nStatement III says Q is the product of two prime numbers. Wait, product of two primes would be like p*q, which would have (1+1)(1+1)=4 factors. But Q has 5, so III is false.\n\nSo looking at the statements: only II is true. But wait, the options don't have an option where only II is correct.

So the correct answer should be C.\n\nWait, but wait a second. What if I made a mistake in considering the exponents? Let me re-examine. The number of factors is 5, which is prime. So the only way to write it as a product is 5*1. So the exponents plus one must be 5 and 1. But 1 would imply that the exponent is zero, which isn't allowed because you can't have a prime raised to zero in the factorization. So the only possibility is a single prime raised to the 4th power.

So the exponents must be such that when each is increased by one, their product is 5.\n\nWait, since 5 is prime, the only possible way is if the number has a single prime factor with exponent 4, because 4+1=5.

So let's look at the options.\n\nStatement I: Q is the square of a prime number. Wait, if Q is p^4, then is that the square of a prime? Well, the square would be p^2. So p^4 is (p\u00b2)\u00b2.

Since 5 is prime, the only way to express it as a product is 5*1. So that means the exponents plus one must be 5 and 1.\n\nWhich implies that the number can be written as p^4, because (4+1) =5. Alternatively, could it have more than one prime factor? Let's see. Suppose it's p^a * q^b. Then (a+1)(b+1)=5. Since 5 is prime, one of them must be 5 and the other 1. So either a+1=5 and b+1=1, which means a=4, b=0. Or the other way around, but since exponents can't be negative, the only possibility is that it's a single prime raised to the 4th power.

Wait, no, p^4 is the fourth power of p, which is a prime. So statement I is incorrect because the square of a prime (p^2) has 3 factors, not 5.

The problem is asking which must be true.\n\nSo let's look at the statements again.\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime: p^2 has 3 factors. So if Q has 5 factors, I is false.\n\nII.

So, if a number Q has a prime factorization of the form p^a * q^b * r^c... then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc.\n\nSo Q has 5 factors. 5 is a prime number, so the product of (exponents + 1) must equal 5. Since 5 is prime, the only way to express it as a product is 5*1. So that means the exponents plus one must be 5 and 1.\n\nWhich implies that the number can be written as p^4, because (4+1) =5. Alternatively, could it have more than one prime factor? Let's see. Suppose it's p^a * q^b. Then (a+1)(b+1)=5. Since 5 is prime, one of them must be 5 and the other 1. So either a+1=5 and b+1=1, which means a=4, b=0. Or the other way around, but since exponents can't be negative, the only possibility is that it's a single prime raised to the 4th power. Because if it had two primes, one would have exponent 4 and the other 0. But if the exponent is 0, that prime isn't actually present, so it's just p^4.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. So if Q has exactly 5 factors, it must be the fourth power of a prime. Because the number of factors is (4+1)=5. So that would make statement II correct.\n\nBut wait, statement I says it's the square of a prime. The square of a prime would be p^2, which has (2+1)=3 factors. So that's not 5. So I is incorrect.\n\nWait, no! Wait, hold on. Let me clarify. Because earlier I thought that if the number of factors is 5, it must be p^4. So statement II is correct, and I is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, statement I says Q is the square of a prime. If Q is p^4, then that's (p^2)^2. So p^4 is the square of p^2, which is a prime squared. Wait, no, p^4 is the fourth power of p, which is a prime. So statement I is incorrect because the square of a prime (p^2) has 3 factors, not 5. So II is correct, I is incorrect.\n\nWhat about statement III? It says Q is the product of two primes. The product of two distinct primes, p and q, would have (1+1)(1+1)=4 factors. So that's 4, not 5. Alternatively, if it's the same prime squared, which is p^2, which has 3 factors. So III can't be correct either.\n\nWait, but wait a second. What if the number is p^4. That's a single prime, so it's not a product of two primes. So statement III is incorrect.\n\nWait, but the initial thought was that statement II is correct. Let me re-examine the options. The problem is asking which must be true.\n\nSo let's look at the statements again.\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime: p^2 has 3 factors. So if Q has 5 factors, I is false.\n\nII. Q is the fourth power of a prime: p^4 has 5 factors. So II is true.\n\nIII. Q is the product of two primes: p*q has 4 factors. So III is false.\n\nSo the only correct statement is II. So the answer should be option C) II only.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because earlier I thought that the number of factors is given by (exponent +1) for each prime. So for a number to have exactly 5 factors, it must be a single prime raised to the 4th power.\n\nSo the correct answer is II only, which is option C.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, option C is II only. So that should be the correct answer.\n\n\nTo determine which statements about \\( Q \\) must be true, we analyze the number of factors \\( Q \\) has. The number of factors of a positive integer is determined by its prime factorization. If \\( Q \\) has a prime factorization of the form \\( p^a \\cdot q^b \\cdot r^c \\cdot \\dots \\), the total number of factors is given by \\( (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)\\dots \\). Since \\( Q \\) has exactly 5 factors and 5 is a prime number, the only way to express 5 as a product is \\( 5 \\times 1 \\). This implies that \\( Q \\) must be of the form \\( p^4 \\), where \\( p \\) is a prime number.\n\n### Analysis of the Statements:\n1. **Statement I: \\( Q \\) is the square of a prime number.**  \n   If \\( Q \\) were the square of a prime number, it would be \\( p^2 \\). The number of factors of \\( p^2 \\) is \\( 2+1 = 3 \\), which is not equal to 5. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **Statement II: \\( Q \\) is the fourth power of a prime number.**  \n   If \\( Q \\) is the fourth power of a prime number, it would be \\( p^4 \\). The number of factors of \\( p^4 \\) is \\( 4+1 = 5 \\), which matches the given condition. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n3. **Statement III: \\( Q \\) is the product of two prime numbers.**  \n   If \\( Q \\) were the product of two prime numbers, it would be \\( p \\cdot q \\). The number of factors of \\( p \\cdot q \\) is \\( (1+1)(1+1) = 4 \\), which is not equal to 5. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true is **II**. \n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out which of the statements I, II, or III must be true about Q. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking.\n\nThe question states that Q is a positive integer with exactly 5 factors. I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. So, I should probably think about how the number of factors is determined.\n\nWait, right. The formula for the number of factors is based on the exponents in the prime factorization. For example, if a number N can be expressed as p^a * q^b, where p and q are primes, then the number of factors is (a+1)(b+1). Oh, right, so each exponent is increased by one and then multiplied together.\n\nNow, Q has 5 factors. Hmm, 5 is a prime number, so the only way to express 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 itself. So the number of factors formula must result in 5. That means (a+1)(b+1) = 5.\n\nSince 5 is prime, the only possibility is that one of the exponents is 4, and the others are 0, but wait, no, because each term in the product has to be at least 1. So, actually, the only way is that there's only one prime factor, and its exponent is 4. Because (4+1) =5, so if Q is p^4, where p is prime, then it has 5 factors.\n\nAlternatively, wait, could there be two primes where one exponent is 4 and the other is 0? No, because if another prime is present, its exponent would have to be at least 1, making the product of (exponents+1) more than 5. So, no, only one prime with exponent 4.\n\nSo that means Q is the fourth power of a prime number. Let me check that.\n\nIf Q = p^4, then the factors are 1, p, p\u00b2, p\u00b3, p^4. That's five factors. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's look at the options given:\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime number.\nII. Q is the fourth power of a prime number.\nIII. Q is the product of two prime numbers.\n\nSo, from what I figured out, Q must be p^4. So statement II is true.\n\nWhat about I? The square of a prime would be p\u00b2. How many factors does that have? Let's see: (2+1)=3 factors. So Q being a square of a prime would have 3 factors. But Q has 5, so statement I is false. So I is not necessarily true. Wait, but wait: if Q is p^4, then is it also the square of a prime squared? Because p^4 is (p\u00b2)\u00b2. So yes, Q is the square of p\u00b2, which is a prime. Wait, no, p\u00b2 is not a prime number. Oh, right, p is prime, but p\u00b2 is not prime. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So if Q is p^4, then Q is (p\u00b2)^2, but p\u00b2 is not prime. So statement I isn't true. So I is false.\n\nStatement III says Q is the product of two primes. The product of two primes would be p * q, each to the first power. Then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1)=4. So 4 factors. But Q has 5, so statement III is false. So III isn't true.\n\nSo, only statement II is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Are there any other possibilities for Q having exactly 5 factors?\n\nWait, no, because 5 is prime, so the only way is a single prime raised to the 4th power. So I think I'm right.\n\nSo, the options are:\n\nA) I only \u2192 Incorrect, because II is correct, not I.\nB) III only \u2192 Incorrect.\nC) II only \u2192 Correct.\nD) I and II only \u2192 Incorrect, since I is wrong.\nE) I and III only \u2192 Also incorrect.\n\nSo the answer should be option C.\n",

Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe question is: If Q, a positive integer, has 5 factors, which of the following must be true about Q? The options are I, II, III, and the possible answers are combinations of these. \n\nHmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Oh right, the formula for finding the number of factors is to take the exponents in the prime factorization, add one to each, and multiply them together. So, for example, if a number N has a prime factorization of N = p^a * q^b, then the number of factors is (a+1)(b+1).\n\nIn this case, Q has exactly 5 factors. So I need to find what form Q must take. Let me think about the factors of 5. Since 5 is a prime number, the only way to express 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5*1. So that means the formula (a+1)(b+1) must equal 5. \n\nWait, but 5 can also be written as 5*1 or 1*5. So that implies that the exponents in the prime factorization of Q must be such that when each is increased by one, their product is 5. \n\nSo let's break that down. Let's say Q is of the form p^a * q^b * r^c... etc., where p, q, r are primes. Then the number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... So since 5 is prime, the only way to get 5 as a product is to have a single term of 5 and the rest as 1. \n\nWait, no. Because 5 is 5 * 1. So that would mean that only one of the exponents plus one is 5, and the others are 1. But wait, if there are other primes, their exponents would have to be zero, meaning they're not actually present. So that suggests that Q can only have one prime factor, because if there were two primes, then the exponents would be at least 1, so (a+1) would be at least 2, and (b+1) would be at least 2, making the product at least 4, which is less than 5. Wait, no, 2*2=4, but if one of them is 5 and the other is 1, that would mean exponents 4 and 0. But zero exponent would mean the prime isn't there. So Q can't have two primes because that would require (a+1)(b+1) =5, which is possible if one exponent is 4 and the other is 0. But wait, if the other exponent is 0, then that prime isn't actually a factor of Q. So Q can only have one prime factor. \n\nSo that would mean Q is of the form p^4, because (4 +1) =5, so 5 factors. Or wait, another possibility: if Q is p^4, then the exponents are 4, and the number of factors is 5. Alternatively, could it be p^2? Wait, no, because if Q is p^2, then the number of factors is 3 (1, p, p^2). So that's only 3 factors. So that's not enough. So for 5 factors, the exponent must be 4. So Q must be p^4, where p is a prime number. \n\nWait, wait a second. No, because another thought: 5 is a prime number, so the number of factors is 5. So the exponents plus one must multiply to 5. So the exponents plus one can only be 5 and 1. So the exponents themselves are 4 and 0. So the only possibility is that Q has one prime factor raised to the 4th power. So that would mean Q is the square of a prime squared? Wait, no. Wait, 4 is 2 squared. So Q = p^4, which is (p^2)^2. So Q is the square of p squared, but p is prime. Alternatively, it's the fourth power of p. \n\nWait, let me think again. If Q = p^4, then the factors are p^0, p^1, p^2, p^3, p^4. So that's 5 factors. So yes, that's correct. So Q must be the fourth power of a prime. So looking back at the options:\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime number. So p^2 would have 3 factors. But Q is p^4, which is (p^2)^2. So I is not correct because Q is p^4, not p^2. Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again. So if Q is p^4, is that the square of a prime? No, because the square of a prime is p^2. So I is saying Q is the square of a prime. That would only have 3 factors. So I is false. \n\nII. Q is the fourth power of a prime number. That's exactly what we have here, so II is correct. \n\nIII. Q is the product of two prime numbers. Well, if Q were the product of two primes, say p and q, then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1)=4. But we have 5 factors, so III is incorrect. \n\nSo which of the options are correct? Only II. So the options are:\n\nOptions are:\nA) I only \u2192 Incorrect because II is correct.\nB) III only \u2192 No, because III is incorrect.\nC) II only \u2192 Yes, this would be correct.\nD) I and II only \u2192 No, because I is incorrect.\nE) I and III only \u2192 No.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C, II only. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. What if Q had two primes, each with exponents that when added by one multiply to 5? Wait, no, because 5 is prime, so (a+1)(b+1) =5 would require one of them to be 5 and the other to be 1. So one exponent is 4, the other is 0. So that's not possible because the other prime wouldn't be present. So Q can't have two primes. So the only possibility is that Q is a single prime raised to the 4th power. \n\nTherefore, the correct statements are II only. So the answer is option C.\n",

But wait, if the other exponent is 0, then that prime isn't actually a factor of Q. So Q can only have one prime factor. \n\nSo that would mean Q is of the form p^4, because (4 +1) =5, so 5 factors. Or wait, another possibility: if Q is p^4, then the exponents are 4, and the number of factors is 5. Alternatively, could it be p^2? Wait, no, because if Q is p^2, then the number of factors is 3 (1, p, p^2). So that's only 3 factors. So that's not enough. So for 5 factors, the exponent must be 4. So Q must be p^4, where p is a prime number. \n\nWait, wait a second. No, because another thought: 5 is a prime number, so the number of factors is 5. So the exponents plus one must multiply to 5. So the exponents plus one can only be 5 and 1. So the exponents themselves are 4 and 0. So the only possibility is that Q has one prime factor raised to the 4th power. So that would mean Q is the square of a prime squared? Wait, no. Wait, 4 is 2 squared. So Q = p^4, which is (p^2)^2. So Q is the square of p squared, but p is prime. Alternatively, it's the fourth power of p. \n\nWait, let me think again. If Q = p^4, then the factors are p^0, p^1, p^2, p^3, p^4. So that's 5 factors. So yes, that's correct. So Q must be the fourth power of a prime. So looking back at the options:\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime number. So p^2 would have 3 factors. But Q is p^4, which is (p^2)^2. So I is not correct because Q is p^4, not p^2. Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again. So if Q is p^4, is that the square of a prime? No, because the square of a prime is p^2. So I is saying Q is the square of a prime. That would only have 3 factors. So I is false. \n\nII. Q is the fourth power of a prime number. That's exactly what we have here, so II is correct. \n\nIII. Q is the product of two prime numbers. Well, if Q were the product of two primes, say p and q, then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1)=4. But we have 5 factors, so III is incorrect. \n\nSo which of the options are correct? Only II. So the options are:\n\nOptions are:\nA) I only \u2192 Incorrect because II is correct.\nB) III only \u2192 No, because III is incorrect.\nC) II only \u2192 Yes, this would be correct.\nD) I and II only \u2192 No, because I is incorrect.\nE) I and III only \u2192 No.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C, II only. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. What if Q had two primes, each with exponents that when added by one multiply to 5? Wait, no, because 5 is prime, so (a+1)(b+1) =5 would require one of them to be 5 and the other to be 1. So one exponent is 4, the other is 0. So that's not possible because the other prime wouldn't be present. So Q can't have two primes. So the only possibility is that Q is a single prime raised to the 4th power. \n\nTherefore, the correct statements are II only. So the answer is option C.\n\n\nTo determine which statements about \\( Q \\) must be true, we analyze the number of factors \\( Q \\) has. The number of factors of a positive integer is determined by its prime factorization. If \\( Q \\) has the prime factorization \\( Q = p^a \\cdot q^b \\cdot r^c \\cdot \\dots \\), the total number of factors is given by \\( (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)\\dots \\). \n\nSince \\( Q \\) has exactly 5 factors and 5 is a prime number, the only way to express 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is \\( 5 \\times 1 \\). This implies that \\( Q \\) must have a prime factorization of the form \\( p^4 \\), where \\( p \\) is a prime number. This is because \\( (4+1) = 5 \\), and any additional prime factors would require their exponents to be 0, meaning they do not contribute to the factorization.\n\nNow, we evaluate the given statements:\n\n1. **Statement I: \\( Q \\) is the square of a prime number.**  \n   If \\( Q \\) were the square of a prime number, its prime factorization would be \\( p^2 \\), which has \\( (2+1) = 3 \\) factors. Since \\( Q \\) has 5 factors, this statement is false.\n\n2. **Statement II: \\( Q \\) is the fourth power of a prime number.**  \n   As shown earlier, \\( Q \\) must be of the form \\( p^4 \\), which has \\( (4+1) = 5 \\) factors. This statement is true.\n\n3. **Statement III: \\( Q \\) is the product of two prime numbers.**  \n   If \\( Q \\) were the product of two prime numbers, its prime factorization would be \\( p \\cdot q \\), and the number of factors would be \\( (1+1)(1+1) = 4 \\). Since \\( Q \\) has 5 factors, this statement is false.\n\nThus, only Statement II is true. The correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: C**",

I need to figure out which of the statements I, II, or III must be true about Q.\n\nWait, I remember something about the number of factors a number has. Oh right, the number of factors is related to the exponents in the prime factorization. Like, if a number N has a prime factorization of N = p^a * q^b * r^c..., then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... and so on for each prime.\n\nSo Q has 5 factors. 5 is a prime number, so the only way to express 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 itself. That means the formula for the number of factors must be 5 = 5*1. So that would imply that the exponents plus one multiply to 5. Since 5 is prime, only one of the terms can be 5 and the rest must be 1. \n\nSo the prime factorization of Q must have only one prime factor with an exponent of 4. Because 4+1=5. So Q would be p^4, where p is prime. \n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. Because 5 can also be written as 5*1, meaning that the number has only one prime factor raised to the 4th power. Because if you had two primes, like p and q, then the number of factors would be (a+1)(b+1). For that to equal 5, one of them would have to be 5 and the other 1. But exponents can't be zero because that would mean the prime isn't present. So wait, exponents start at 1? No, wait. The exponent can be zero, which would mean that prime isn't a factor. But if a prime isn't a factor, it's not part of the factorization. So, for example, if you have (a+1)(b+1) = 5, then one of them has to be 5 and the other 1. So either a+1=5 and b+1=1. If b+1=1, then b=0, which means q isn't a factor. So that's not possible because if you have two primes, both would have exponents at least 1. So, that can't happen. So the only possibility is that Q is the fourth power of a prime, because that gives (4+1)=5 factors.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. If Q is the square of a prime, like p^2, then the number of factors is 2+1=3. So that's only 3 factors, right? So if Q is p^4, it has 5 factors. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime, which would be p^2, which would have 3 factors. That doesn't fit. So statement I is not true because Q has 5 factors, not 3. So statement I is false.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, I thought the number of factors for p^4 is 5, so statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So that's p^2, which has 3 factors. So if Q is p^4, it's not the square of a prime, unless p^4 is (p^2)^2. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: Q is the square of a prime would mean Q = p\u00b2. But if Q is p^4, that's (p\u00b2) squared. So, wait, no, p^4 is the fourth power, not the square. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime, which would give 3 factors. So in our case, Q has 5 factors, so statement I is false.\n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me double-check. The number of factors when Q is p^4 is 5. So Q is p^4, which is the fourth power of a prime. So statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime, which would be correct. So statement II is true.\n\nWhat about statement III: Q is the product of two primes. Well, the product of two primes would be p*q, which has (1+1)(1+1)=4 factors. But Q has 5 factors, so statement III is false because that would give 4 factors. So statement III is not true.\n\nSo now, looking at the options:\n\nI. False\nII. True\nIII. False\n\nSo which options include only II? Looking at the options:\n\nA) I only \u2192 False\nB) III only \u2192 False\nC) II only \u2192 True\nD) I and II only \u2192 I is false, so D is false\nE) I and III only \u2192 both false, so E is false.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C: II only.\n\nWait, but wait. Did I make a mistake earlier? Because I thought that the number of factors for p^4 is 5, so II is correct. But what if Q is the product of a prime squared and another prime? Let me think: (p^2)*q. Then the number of factors is (2+1)(1+1) = 3*2=6. That's more than 5, so that's not possible. So the only way to have 5 factors is when it's p^4.\n\nSo yes, statement II is correct, others are not.

So statement I is not correct. Wait, but wait a second. Or did I make a mistake earlier?\n\nWait, let me double-check. If Q is p^4, then the number of factors is 4+1=5. So that fits. So Q must be a fourth power of a prime. So statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime. So that would be true.\n\nWait, but what about statement I? Statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Well, the square of a prime would be p^2, which gives 3 factors. So if Q is p^4, then it's not the square but the fourth power. So statement I is not correct.\n\nWait, but I thought I read that a number with exactly 3 factors is the square of a prime. So statement I is about 3 factors, not 5. So in our case, statement I is not necessarily true because Q has 5 factors, which comes from p^4.\n\nWait, so statement II is correct. What about statement III? Statement III says Q is the product of two primes. So like p * q. Then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1)=4. But our case has 5 factors, so statement III is not correct either.\n\nWait, so let me recap. For a number to have exactly 5 factors, it must be the fourth power of a prime. So only statement II is correct. So looking at the options, option C says II only. So the answer should be option C.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Let me think again. Are there any other possibilities? Like, could there be a case where Q has more than one prime factor and still has 5 factors? Let's see. Let's say Q has two primes, p and q. Then the number of factors would be (a+1)(b+1)=5. Since 5 is prime, one of the terms must be 5 and the other 1. So (a+1)=5 and (b+1)=1, but b can't be zero because that would mean q^0=1, so Q would be p^4 * 1 = p^4, which is the same as the single prime case. So no, there's no way to have two primes and have 5 factors. So the only way is a single prime raised to the 4th power. So statement II is correct, statements I and III are incorrect.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C.\n\n\nTo determine which statements about \\( Q \\) must be true, we analyze the number of factors \\( Q \\) has. The number of factors of a positive integer is determined by its prime factorization. If \\( Q \\) has the prime factorization \\( Q = p_1^{a} p_2^{b} \\dots \\), the total number of factors is given by \\( (a+1)(b+1)\\dots \\). Since \\( Q \\) has exactly 5 factors, and 5 is a prime number, the only way to express 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is \\( 5 \\times 1 \\). This implies that \\( Q \\) must be the fourth power of a single prime number, \\( Q = p^4 \\), because \\( (4+1) = 5 \\).\n\nNow, let us evaluate the statements:\n\n1. **Statement I: \\( Q \\) is the square of a prime number.**  \n   If \\( Q \\) were the square of a prime number, \\( Q = p^2 \\), it would have \\( (2+1) = 3 \\) factors. However, \\( Q \\) has 5 factors, so this statement is false.\n\n2. **Statement II: \\( Q \\) is the fourth power of a prime number.**  \n   As shown above, \\( Q = p^4 \\) has \\( (4+1) = 5 \\) factors, which matches the given condition. Thus, this statement is true.\n\n3. **Statement III: \\( Q \\) is the product of two prime numbers.**  \n   If \\( Q \\) were the product of two primes, \\( Q = p \\cdot q \\), it would have \\( (1+1)(1+1) = 4 \\) factors. However, \\( Q \\) has 5 factors, so this statement is false.\n\nFrom this analysis, only Statement II is true. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question is about a positive integer Q that has 5 factors. I need to determine which of the statements I, II, or III must be true about Q.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Oh right, if a number is expressed as a product of primes raised to exponents, like Q = p\u2081^a * p\u2082^b * ... then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)... etc. So each exponent is increased by one and multiplied together.\n\nIn this case, Q has 5 factors. Wait, 5 is a prime number, so the only way to express it as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5*1. So that means the exponents plus one must multiply to 5. Since 5 is prime, the only possibility is that there's one prime factor with an exponent of 4, because 4+1=5. Or wait, could it be multiple exponents? Let me think. No, because if there were two primes, each exponent plus one would have to multiply to 5. So one would have to be 5 and the other 1. But exponents can't be zero because that would mean no prime factor. So the only possible way is a single prime raised to the 4th power.\n\nWait, no, wait. Another thought. Wait, 5 factors could also come from a single prime raised to the 4th power. Because (4+1) =5. So Q would be p^4, where p is prime. That would give factors 1, p, p\u00b2, p\u00b3, p\u2074. That's five factors.\n\nWait, but wait, could there be another case? Let me think. Suppose Q has two different prime factors. Then the number of factors would be (a+1)(b+1). For this product to be 5, since 5 is prime, one of (a+1) or (b+1) would have to be 5, and the other 1. But exponents can't be zero because that would imply that the prime isn't present. So the other exponent would have to be zero, which is not allowed. So no, it's not possible for Q to have two different prime factors because that would require one exponent to be zero, which isn't allowed. So Q must be a single prime raised to the 4th power.\n\nSo that means statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Wait, square is p\u00b2. But Q is p\u2074. So statement I would be false because it's the fourth power, not the square. Wait, wait, no. Wait, p squared is p\u00b2, but p\u2074 is (p\u00b2)^2. So statement I says it's the square of a prime. Well, p\u2074 is indeed the square of p\u00b2, but p\u00b2 isn't a prime unless p is 1, which it's not because primes are greater than 1. So statement I is not necessarily true. Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because Q is p\u2074, which is (p\u00b2)^2. But p\u00b2 is not a prime unless p is 2, which makes p\u00b2=4, which isn't a prime. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. But p is a prime, and p\u00b2 is not. So statement I would be false. Hmm, but wait, I thought earlier that Q is p\u2074. So then, statement I is not true. So statement I is incorrect.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me get back. The number of factors is 5. So the formula gives (4+1) =5, so Q must be p\u2074, where p is prime. So statement I is Q is the square of a prime. That would be p\u00b2. So if Q is p\u2074, that's p squared squared. So Q is (p\u00b2)^2, which is a square of p\u00b2. But p\u00b2 is not a prime, it's a composite. So statement I is incorrect. So statement I is false. Hmm, but I thought maybe I was wrong earlier.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. Another way: the number of factors is 5. So 5 is prime, so the only possible exponent is 4. So Q = p\u2074. So statement I says it's the square of a prime. So that would mean Q = (q)^2, where q is a prime. So if Q is p\u2074, can we write that as (q)^2? Yes, if q is p squared. But p is a prime, so p squared is not a prime. So statement I is not necessarily true. So statement I is false.\n\nWait, but wait. No, statement I is saying that Q is the square of a prime. So if Q is p^4, then it's the square of p^2. But p^2 is not a prime, so statement I is not correct. So statement I is false.\n\nSo statement I is not true. Then what about statement II? Statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime. Yes, because Q is p\u2074, so II is correct. So statement II is true.\n\nStatement III says Q is the product of two primes. Well, product of two primes would be p*q, which would have (1+1)(1+1) =4 factors. But Q has 5 factors, so statement III is false. So III is incorrect.\n\nWait, but wait. If Q is the product of two primes, like p * q, then the number of factors is (1+1)(1+1) =4, which is different from 5. So statement III is false.\n\nSo now, looking back at the options:\n\nI: false\n\nII: true\n\nIII: false\n\nSo which options have only II? Looking at the options:\n\nOptions:\n\nA) I only \u2192 no, since II is correct.\n\nB) III only \u2192 no.\n\nC) II only \u2192 yes, that's option C.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, let me double-check. So if Q is p\u2074, then statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So Q is (p\u00b2)^2. But p\u00b2 is not a prime, so statement I is not true. So only statement II is correct. So the correct answer should be option C.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. I'm a bit confused because I thought sometimes the square of a prime is considered in factors. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial approach. Let me consider the number of factors again. Let me take an example. Let's say p is 2. Then Q would be 2^4=16. What are the factors of 16? 1, 2,4,8,16. That's 5 factors. So Q=16. Is 16 the square of a prime? Well, 16 is 4 squared, but 4 is not a prime. So statement I is false. Is it the fourth power of a prime? Yes, because 2^4=16. So statement II is true. Statement III says it's the product of two primes. 16 is 2*2*2*2, which is not a product of two distinct primes. So III is false.\n\nSo in this case, only statement II is correct. So the answer should be option C: II only.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a positive integer Q that has exactly 5 factors. Then, there are three statements, I, II, III, and I need to determine which of them must be true about Q. The options are various combinations of these statements.\n\nHmm, right. I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. So, the formula for the number of factors is that if a number N can be expressed as the product of primes raised to exponents, like N = p1^a * p2^b * p3^c ..., then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... and so on for each prime.\n\nSo in this case, Q has 5 factors. 5 is a prime number, so the only way to write 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 itself. That means the formula (a+1)(b+1)... must equal 5. Since 5 is prime, the only possible way is for one of the exponents to be 4 (because 4+1=5), and all others would have to be zero, meaning there's only one prime factor.\n\nWait, because if you have more than one prime factor, then the product would have more than one term. For example, if there were two primes, their exponents would contribute factors like (a+1)(b+1) which would multiply to 5. But 5 is prime, so the only way is if one of them is 5 and the other is 1. But since exponents can't be negative, the exponents would have to be 4 and 0. But exponents can't be zero in that case because that would mean the prime isn't present. So, that can't happen. Therefore, the number must have exactly one prime factor, and its exponent must be 4. So, the number is p^4, where p is a prime number.\n\nSo that would make Q the fourth power of a prime. So looking at the statements:\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime number. Well, p^4 is (p^2)^2, which is a square. So yes, it is the square of a prime. Wait, but wait a second, if Q is p^4, then its square root is p^2, which is not necessarily a prime, but in any case, Q is the square of p squared. But statement I says it's the square of a prime. So p^4 is (p^2)^2, but p^2 is not a prime unless p is 2. Wait, no, p is a prime, so p^2 is a square of a prime, but it's not a prime itself. So, is Q the square of a prime? Let me think. Wait, no. Because Q is p^4. So, for example, if p is 2, then Q is 16. Is 16 the square of a prime? Well, 16 is 4 squared, but 4 isn't a prime. So, no, 16 is not the square of a prime. So statement I is not necessarily true. Hmm, that's conflicting with my earlier thought.\n\nWait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again. If Q is p^4, then the square of Q would be p^8, but that's not relevant. Wait, no, statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So, is Q = (prime)^2? For example, if p is 3, then Q is 81. Is 81 the square of a prime? 81 is 9 squared, but 9 is not a prime. So, no, 81 is not the square of a prime. So statement I is not necessarily true. So maybe statement I is false.\n\nWait, but another approach: the number of factors is 5. So, possible forms of Q are p^4, where p is prime. So, for example, 2^4 =16, which has 5 factors (1,2,4,8,16). So, is 16 the square of a prime? 16 is 4^2, but 4 isn't a prime. So, statement I would be false in this case.\n\nSo statement I is not necessarily true. So I is not correct. Hmm, so that's a point.\n\nStatement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime. Well, yes, because as we concluded, Q must be p^4. So statement II must be true.\n\nStatement III says Q is the product of two prime numbers. So, Q = p * q, where p and q are primes. Then, the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1) = 4. But wait, in our case, the number of factors is 5, which is odd. So, if Q is the product of two distinct primes, it would have 4 factors. If it's the square of a prime, then it would have 3 factors. So, no, Q cannot be the product of two primes because that would give 4 factors, not 5. So statement III is false.\n\nSo, looking back at the options, the correct statements are only II. Let me check the options. The options are:\n\nA) I only\nB) III only\nC) II only\nD) I and II only\nE) I and III only\n\nSo, option C is II only. Therefore, the answer should be C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a positive integer Q that has exactly 5 factors. Then, there are three statements, I, II, III, and I need to determine which of them must be true about Q. The options are various combinations of these statements.\n\nHmm, right. I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. So, the formula for the number of factors is that if a number N can be expressed as the product of primes raised to exponents, like N = p1^a * p2^b * p3^c ..., then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... and so on for each prime.\n\nSo in this case, Q has 5 factors. 5 is a prime number, so the only way to write 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 itself. That means the formula (a+1)(b+1)... must equal 5. Since 5 is prime, the only possible way is for one of the exponents to be 4 (because 4+1=5), and all others would have to be zero, meaning there's only one prime factor.\n\nWait, because if you have more than one prime factor, then the product would have more than one term. For example, if there were two primes, their exponents would contribute factors like (a+1)(b+1) which would multiply to 5. But 5 is prime, so the only way is if one of them is 5 and the other is 1. But since exponents can't be negative, the exponents would have to be 4 and 0. But exponents can't be zero in that case because that would mean the prime isn't present. So, that can't happen. Therefore, the number must have exactly one prime factor, and its exponent must be 4. So, the number is p^4, where p is a prime number.\n\nSo that would make Q the fourth power of a prime. So looking at the statements:\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime number. Well, p^4 is (p^2)^2, which is a square. So yes, it is the square of a prime. Wait, but wait a second, if Q is p^4, then its square root is p^2, which is not necessarily a prime, but in any case, Q is the square of p squared. But statement I says it's the square of a prime. So p^4 is (p^2)^2, but p^2 is not a prime unless p is 2. Wait, no, p is a prime, so p^2 is a square of a prime, but it's not a prime itself. So, is Q the square of a prime? Let me think. Wait, no. Because Q is p^4. So, for example, if p is 2, then Q is 16. Is 16 the square of a prime? Well, 16 is 4 squared, but 4 isn't a prime. So, no, 16 is not the square of a prime. So statement I is not necessarily true. Hmm, that's conflicting with my earlier thought.\n\nWait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again. If Q is p^4, then the square of Q would be p^8, but that's not relevant. Wait, no, statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So, is Q = (prime)^2? For example, if p is 3, then Q is 81. Is 81 the square of a prime? 81 is 9 squared, but 9 is not a prime. So, no, 81 is not the square of a prime. So statement I is not necessarily true. So maybe statement I is false.\n\nWait, but another approach: the number of factors is 5. So, possible forms of Q are p^4, where p is prime. So, for example, 2^4 =16, which has 5 factors (1,2,4,8,16). So, is 16 the square of a prime? 16 is 4^2, but 4 isn't a prime. So, statement I would be false in this case.\n\nSo statement I is not necessarily true. So I is not correct. Hmm, so that's a point.\n\nStatement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime. Well, yes, because as we concluded, Q must be p^4. So statement II must be true.\n\nStatement III says Q is the product of two prime numbers. So, Q = p * q, where p and q are primes. Then, the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1) = 4. But wait, in our case, the number of factors is 5, which is odd. So, if Q is the product of two distinct primes, it would have 4 factors. If it's the square of a prime, then it would have 3 factors. So, no, Q cannot be the product of two primes because that would give 4 factors, not 5. So statement III is false.\n\nSo, looking back at the options, the correct statements are only II. Let me check the options. The options are:\n\nA) I only\nB) III only\nC) II only\nD) I and II only\nE) I and III only\n\nSo, option C is II only. Therefore, the answer should be C.\n\n\nTo determine which statements about \\( Q \\) must be true, we analyze the given information that \\( Q \\), a positive integer, has exactly 5 factors. The number of factors of a positive integer is determined by its prime factorization. If \\( Q \\) has a prime factorization of the form \\( Q = p_1^{a} p_2^{b} p_3^{c} \\dots \\), the total number of factors is given by \\( (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)\\dots \\). \n\nSince \\( Q \\) has exactly 5 factors, and 5 is a prime number, the only way to express 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is \\( 5 = 5 \\). This means \\( Q \\) must be of the form \\( p^4 \\), where \\( p \\) is a prime number. This is because \\( (4+1) = 5 \\), and all other exponents must be zero (i.e., there is only one prime factor).\n\nNow, we evaluate the statements:\n\n1. **Statement I: \\( Q \\) is the square of a prime number.**  \n   If \\( Q = p^4 \\), then \\( Q \\) is indeed a square (since \\( p^4 = (p^2)^2 \\)).

The options are I, II, III, and combinations of them. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Oh right! If a number Q can be expressed as the product of primes raised to their respective exponents, like Q = p\u2081^a * p\u2082^b * ... p\u2099^k, then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)...(k+1). \n\nWait, the question says Q has exactly 5 factors. So, the product of (exponents + 1) should equal 5. What's 5 as a product of integers? Well, 5 is a prime number, so the only way to write it as a product is 5 \u00d7 1. That means that the exponents plus one must multiply to 5. \n\nSo, the exponents in the prime factorization must be such that when each is increased by one, their product is 5. Since 5 is prime, the only way is if there's a single exponent plus one equals 5, and all others are 1. Wait, no, because if there's more than one prime factor, their exponents plus one would multiply. So, let's think. For example, if Q has two distinct prime factors, then the exponents would be a and b, and (a+1)(b+1) =5. But 5 can't be broken into two integers greater than 1, except 5\u00d71. So, one exponent would be 4, and the other would be 0. But wait, exponent can't be zero because that would mean that prime isn't a factor. So, actually, the only way is that Q is the power of a single prime.\n\nWait, because if you have two primes, like p^4 * q^0, but q^0 is 1, so Q is p^4. So, that's the only possibility. Because if you have more than one prime, you can't get the product to be 5, since 5 is prime. So, Q must be of the form p^4, where p is a prime.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Let me think again. Suppose Q is p^4. Then the number of factors is 4 + 1 =5. That's correct. So Q is the square of a prime number? No, wait. Wait, p^4 is the fourth power, not the square. Oh wait, wait. Let me check. If Q is p^2, then the number of factors is 2+1=3, which is 3 factors. But we need 5. So Q is p^4, which gives 5 factors. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime, which would be p^2, but that's incorrect because p^2 would have 3 factors. So statement I is incorrect? Wait, that can't be right.\n\nWait, wait. Let me recheck. Let me think about the number of factors for p^4. So, the exponents are 4. So 4+1=5 factors. So yes, Q is p^4. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime, which would be p\u00b2. So that's not correct. Statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime, which would be p^4. So statement II is correct. Statement III says Q is the product of two primes. Well, if Q were p*q, then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1)=4, which is 4, not 5. So statement III is not correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. So the options are I, II, III.\n\nI: Q is the square of a prime. So p\u00b2. Number of factors:3. So no, because Q has 5.\n\nII: Q is the fourth power of a prime. So p^4. Number of factors:5. So yes, II is correct.\n\nIII: Product of two primes. p*q. Number of factors:4. So no, so III is wrong.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Are there any other possibilities for the form of Q? Because I thought the only way to get 5 factors is p^4. But what about if Q is a cube of a square, like p^2 squared is p^4. So no, that's same as before. Alternatively, is there any other way to get 5 factors? Let's think about another approach.\n\nSuppose Q is a product of two primes, p and q. Then number of factors is (1+1)(1+1)=4. So that's 4, not 5. So no. If it's a cube, like p^3, then number of factors is 3+1=4. So again, not 5. So the only way is p^4.\n\nSo, the correct statements are II only. So looking at the options, option C is II only. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure. So the statements are:\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime. So p\u00b2: 3 factors. So no.\n\nII. Q is the fourth power of a prime. So p^4:5 factors. So yes.\n\nIII. Q is the product of two primes. So p*q:4 factors. So no.\n\nSo the only correct statement is II.

Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe question is about a positive integer Q that has exactly 5 factors. I have to determine which of the statements I, II, or III must be true about Q. The options are given as A to E, each combining different statements.\n\nHmm, I remember something about the number of factors a number has. Oh right! The number of factors of a number is determined by its prime factorization. If a number N has a prime factorization of, say, p1^a * p2^b * p3^c..., then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc. So each exponent is increased by one and then multiplied together.\n\nIn this case, Q has 5 factors. So I need to find what exponents would lead to 5 when each is increased by one and multiplied. Let's think about the possible combinations.\n\n5 is a prime number, right? So the only way to write 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 * 1. So the exponents plus one must multiply to 5. That would mean that there's only one term in the product, which is 5. So, one exponent plus one equals 5, which means that exponent is 4.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait a second. Let me think again. If the total number of factors is 5, then the exponents plus one multiply to 5. Since 5 is prime, the only way is 5 = 5 * 1. So that means that Q must have a single prime factor raised to the 4th power. Because the exponent is 4, because 4+1=5.\n\nWait, but wait, is that the only possibility? Let me double-check. Let's see, could it be two primes each with exponents such that (a+1)(b+1)=5? Well, 5 is a prime, so the only factors are 1 and 5. So the exponents could be (4,0) or (0,4), but since exponents can't be negative, the only possibility is one prime with exponent 4, and the rest with exponent 0, which just means they're not present.\n\nWait, but another thought: If Q is a square of a prime, then its prime factorization is p^2. So the number of factors would be 2+1=3 factors. But wait, the question says 5 factors. So that's not right. Wait, so if a number has a prime squared, like p^2, the factors are 1, p, p^2. That's three factors, right. So if Q is p^4, then the factors would be 1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4. That's five factors, which matches the question.\n\nSo, the number must be of the form p^4, where p is a prime. So Q is the fourth power of a prime. So let's look at the statements:\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime number. Well, if Q is p^4, then it's the square of p^2. So, the square of a prime squared. But wait, p^2 is a prime? No, wait. p is a prime, p squared is not a prime. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So if Q is p^4, then Q is (p\u00b2)^2, which is a square, but p\u00b2 isn't a prime. So statement I would only be true if p^4 is the square of a prime. But wait, that's only true if p is the square root of Q? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So if Q is p^4, then p^4 is (p^2)^2. So p^2 would have to be a prime. But p is a prime, so p^2 is not a prime. So statement I would be false. Because Q is p^4, which is the square of p\u00b2, which is not a prime. So statement I is not true.\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right. Because if Q is p^4, then it's the fourth power of a prime. So statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime, which would be true. So statement II is correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that Q must be p^4. So let me go back. The number of factors is 5, so the exponents plus one must multiply to 5. Since 5 is prime, it can only be written as 5=5*1. So the only possibility is that there's one prime factor with exponent 4, and any other primes would have exponent 0, which means they don't exist. So yes, Q must be p^4, where p is prime.\n\nSo that means statement II is correct. What about statement I? Statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So if Q is p^4, then it's (p\u00b2)^2. So p\u00b2 is a number, but not necessarily a prime. So for example, if p is 2, then Q is 16. 16 is 4 squared, where 4 is not a prime. So statement I is not necessarily true. So statement I is false.\n\nWhat about statement III? Statement III says Q is the product of two primes. So if Q is p^4, then it's p multiplied four times. So it's not the product of two primes, it's the product of p multiplied by itself four times. So statement III would be false because it's p^4, not p*q where p and q are primes.\n\nWait, but wait, could Q be the product of two primes? Let me think. Suppose Q = p * q, where p and q are primes. Then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1) =4 factors. So that would give 4 factors, not 5. So that's not the case. So statement III is not correct.\n\nSo, let's recap:\n\n- Statement I: Q is the square of a prime. If Q is p^4, then it's the square of p^2, which is not a prime. So I is false.\n\n- Statement II: Q is the fourth power of a prime. Correct, since Q is p^4.\n\n- Statement III: Q is the product of two primes. No, because that would give four factors, not five. So III is false.\n\nSo which of the statements must be true? Only statement II is correct. So the answer would be option C, which is II only.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, option C is II only. But wait, the options are:\n\nA) I only\n\nB) III only\n\nC) II only\n\nD) I and II only\n\nE) I and III only\n\nWait, but wait, I thought statement I was incorrect. So the correct statements would only be II. So the answer is C.\n\nWait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me recheck.\n\nIf Q is p^4, then it's the fourth power of a prime, which makes statement II correct. So II is true.\n\nWhat about statement I? Statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Well, Q is p^4, which is (p^2)^2. So the square of p^2. But p^2 is not a prime unless p=2, but even then, p^2 is 4, which isn't prime.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe question is about a positive integer Q that has exactly 5 factors. I have to determine which of the statements I, II, or III must be true about Q. The options are given as A to E, each combining different statements.\n\nHmm, I remember something about the number of factors a number has. Oh right! The number of factors of a number is determined by its prime factorization. If a number N has a prime factorization of, say, p1^a * p2^b * p3^c..., then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc. So each exponent is increased by one and then multiplied together.\n\nIn this case, Q has 5 factors. So I need to find what exponents would lead to 5 when each is increased by one and multiplied. Let's think about the possible combinations.\n\n5 is a prime number, right? So the only way to write 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 * 1. So the exponents plus one must multiply to 5. That would mean that there's only one term in the product, which is 5. So, one exponent plus one equals 5, which means that exponent is 4.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait a second. Let me think again. If the total number of factors is 5, then the exponents plus one multiply to 5. Since 5 is prime, the only way is 5 = 5 * 1. So that means that Q must have a single prime factor raised to the 4th power. Because the exponent is 4, because 4+1=5.\n\nWait, but wait, is that the only possibility? Let me double-check. Let's see, could it be two primes each with exponents such that (a+1)(b+1)=5? Well, 5 is a prime, so the only factors are 1 and 5. So the exponents could be (4,0) or (0,4), but since exponents can't be negative, the only possibility is one prime with exponent 4, and the rest with exponent 0, which just means they're not present.\n\nWait, but another thought: If Q is a square of a prime, then its prime factorization is p^2. So the number of factors would be 2+1=3 factors. But wait, the question says 5 factors. So that's not right. Wait, so if a number has a prime squared, like p^2, the factors are 1, p, p^2. That's three factors, right. So if Q is p^4, then the factors would be 1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4. That's five factors, which matches the question.\n\nSo, the number must be of the form p^4, where p is a prime. So Q is the fourth power of a prime. So let's look at the statements:\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime number. Well, if Q is p^4, then it's the square of p^2. So, the square of a prime squared. But wait, p^2 is a prime? No, wait. p is a prime, p squared is not a prime. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So if Q is p^4, then Q is (p\u00b2)^2, which is a square, but p\u00b2 isn't a prime. So statement I would only be true if p^4 is the square of a prime. But wait, that's only true if p is the square root of Q? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So if Q is p^4, then p^4 is (p^2)^2. So p^2 would have to be a prime. But p is a prime, so p^2 is not a prime. So statement I would be false. Because Q is p^4, which is the square of p\u00b2, which is not a prime. So statement I is not true.\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right. Because if Q is p^4, then it's the fourth power of a prime. So statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime, which would be true. So statement II is correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that Q must be p^4. So let me go back. The number of factors is 5, so the exponents plus one must multiply to 5. Since 5 is prime, it can only be written as 5=5*1. So the only possibility is that there's one prime factor with exponent 4, and any other primes would have exponent 0, which means they don't exist. So yes, Q must be p^4, where p is prime.\n\nSo that means statement II is correct. What about statement I? Statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So if Q is p^4, then it's (p\u00b2)^2. So p\u00b2 is a number, but not necessarily a prime. So for example, if p is 2, then Q is 16. 16 is 4 squared, where 4 is not a prime. So statement I is not necessarily true. So statement I is false.\n\nWhat about statement III? Statement III says Q is the product of two primes. So if Q is p^4, then it's p multiplied four times. So it's not the product of two primes, it's the product of p multiplied by itself four times. So statement III would be false because it's p^4, not p*q where p and q are primes.\n\nWait, but wait, could Q be the product of two primes? Let me think. Suppose Q = p * q, where p and q are primes. Then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1) =4 factors. So that would give 4 factors, not 5. So that's not the case. So statement III is not correct.\n\nSo, let's recap:\n\n- Statement I: Q is the square of a prime. If Q is p^4, then it's the square of p^2, which is not a prime. So I is false.\n\n- Statement II: Q is the fourth power of a prime. Correct, since Q is p^4.\n\n- Statement III: Q is the product of two primes. No, because that would give four factors, not five. So III is false.\n\nSo which of the statements must be true? Only statement II is correct. So the answer would be option C, which is II only.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, option C is II only. But wait, the options are:\n\nA) I only\n\nB) III only\n\nC) II only\n\nD) I and II only\n\nE) I and III only\n\nWait, but wait, I thought statement I was incorrect. So the correct statements would only be II. So the answer is C.\n\nWait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me recheck.\n\nIf Q is p^4, then it's the fourth power of a prime, which makes statement II correct. So II is true.\n\nWhat about statement I? Statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Well, Q is p^4, which is (p^2)^2. So the square of p^2. But p^2 is not a prime unless p=2, but even then, p^2 is 4, which isn't prime. So in general, p^4 is the square of a composite number, not a prime. So statement I is false.\n\nSo only statement II is correct.

Then, I have to determine which of the statements I, II, III must be true about Q. The options are A to E, each combining different statements.\n\nHmm, factors. Right, the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. I remember that if a number N has a prime factorization of, say, p^a * q^b, then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... for each prime. Oh right, because each exponent can range from 0 up to its maximum in the prime factors.\n\nSo Q has 5 factors. Wait, 5 is a prime number. So the number of factors equation would be 5 = 5*1, since 5 can't be broken down into smaller integers greater than 1. So that would mean that the exponents plus one multiply to 5. So, the only way is that one prime has an exponent of 4, because 4+1=5, and the others (if any) would have exponents of 0, which means they don't contribute. Or wait, could it be multiple primes with exponents such that their (exponent +1) multiply to 5? No, because 5 is prime, so only one term can be 5, and the rest would have to be 1. So that means that Q must be of the form p^4, where p is a prime number. Because 4+1=5 factors.\n\nWait, let me think again. If Q is p^4, then the factors are p^0, p^1, p^2, p^3, p^4. So yes, 5 factors. So that would make statement I: Q is the square of a prime. Wait, the square is p^2. But Q is p^4. So I is saying Q is a square, but that's not necessarily the case. Because p^4 is a square (since (p^2)^2 = p^4). Oh wait, yes, p^4 is a square of p^2, which is a square of a prime. So Q is the square of a prime. So statement I is true.\n\nStatement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime. Which would also be true because Q is p^4. So II is also true. Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. So if Q is p^4, then yes, it's a fourth power. So II is true.\n\nStatement III: Q is the product of two primes. So product of two primes would be like p*q, where p and q are primes. The number of factors for p*q would be (1+1)(1+1)=4. Because exponents are 1 and 1. So 4 factors, not 5. So III is not true because Q has 5 factors, which would require a different structure.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. If Q is the product of two primes, like p^1 * q^1, then the number of factors is (1+1)(1+1)=4. So that's four, not five. So that's not possible. So statement III is false.\n\nSo going back to the statements: I is true because Q is p^4, which is a square of p^2, and p is prime. II is true because it's p^4. III is false.\n\nWait, but let me look at the options again. The options are:\n\nA) I only\nB) III only\nC) II only\nD) I and II only\nE) I and III only\n\nSo in this case, both I and II are true.

Like, if there's a case where Q is a product of more primes, but that would require exponents that result in (a+1)(b+1)...=5. Since 5 is prime, the only way is one exponent is 4 and the rest are 0. So it's p^4, no other possibilities. So I and II must be true.\n\nSo the answer should be D.\n",

The question is about finding which statements must be true about a positive integer Q that has exactly 5 factors. There are three statements given, I, II, III, and I need to check which ones are correct.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Oh right! If a number Q has a prime factorization of the form Q = p\u2081^a * p\u2082^b * p\u2083^c..., then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc. So each exponent is increased by one and multiplied together.\n\nSince Q has exactly 5 factors, and 5 is a prime number, the only way to write 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 = 5 * 1. So that means the exponents in the prime factorization must be such that when each is increased by one and multiplied, it gives 5. \n\nWait, so the exponents plus one multiply to 5. Since 5 is prime, the only possible way is that there's only one prime factor, and its exponent plus one is 5. Because if there were two primes, say, then (a+1)(b+1)=5, but 5 can't be broken into two factors except 5 and 1. So one of the exponents would have to be 4, and the other 0. But an exponent of 0 means that prime isn't present. So effectively, it's just a single prime raised to the 4th power.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. If there's only one prime factor, then the number of factors is (a+1) =5. So a must be 4. So Q is p^4. So in that case, Q would be the fourth power of a prime. That would make statement II correct. But wait, the first statement says Q is the square of a prime. So that would be p^2, but that would have (2+1)=3 factors, right? No, wait, 3 factors would be p\u00b2, which is correct for 3 factors. But in our case, Q has 5 factors, so a must be 4. So Q is p^4, which would mean statement II is correct, and I is wrong.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check. If a number has exactly 5 factors, what must it be? Because 5 is prime, the number of factors is 5, which comes from exponents plus one. So yes, the only possibility is a single prime raised to the 4th power. So that would make statement I incorrect and II correct.\n\nBut wait, wait. Another thought: Oh! Wait, wait, wait. No, I think I made a mistake. Because sometimes, when you have a number like p^4, the factors are 1, p, p\u00b2, p\u00b3, p^4. That's five factors. So Q is the fourth power of a prime. So statement II is correct, but statement I says it's the square of a prime. The square of a prime is p\u00b2, which would have 3 factors (1, p, p\u00b2). So statement I would be wrong in this case because Q is p^4, not p^2. So statement I is false.\n\nBut wait, what about statement III? Statement III says Q is the product of two primes. So that would be if Q had two distinct prime factors, each to the first power. For example, p*q. Then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1) =4. So 4 factors. But our Q has 5 factors, so statement III is false as well. So only statement II is correct.\n\nWait, but looking back, let me make sure I'm not confusing anything. Let me list the possibilities for the number of factors:\n\n- If a number is p^4, then factors are 1, p, p\u00b2, p\u00b3, p^4 \u2192 5 factors. So yes, this fits.\n\n- If a number is p^2, factors are 1, p, p\u00b2 \u2192 3 factors.\n\n- If a number is p*q (two distinct primes), factors are 1, p, q, pq \u2192 4 factors.\n\nSo in our case, Q must be p^4, so statement II is correct. So looking at the options:\n\nOptions are:\n\nA) I only \u2192 only statement I is true. But in our case, statement II is true, so A is wrong.\n\nB) III only \u2192 statement III is wrong, so B is wrong.\n\nC) II only \u2192 correct, because only II is true.\n\nD) I and II only \u2192 No, because I is not true.\n\nE) I and III only \u2192 Both are wrong.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Another possibility: What if Q is the product of a prime squared and another prime? Like p\u00b2 * q. Then the number of factors would be (2+1)(1+1) = 3*2=6 factors. But we need exactly 5, so that doesn't fit. So that's not possible.\n\nSo yes, the only way to get exactly five factors is to have a single prime raised to the fourth power. So statements I and III are incorrect, only II is correct. So the answer is C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding which statements must be true about a positive integer Q that has exactly 5 factors. There are three statements given, I, II, III, and I need to check which ones are correct.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Oh right! If a number Q has a prime factorization of the form Q = p\u2081^a * p\u2082^b * p\u2083^c..., then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc. So each exponent is increased by one and multiplied together.\n\nSince Q has exactly 5 factors, and 5 is a prime number, the only way to write 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 = 5 * 1. So that means the exponents in the prime factorization must be such that when each is increased by one and multiplied, it gives 5. \n\nWait, so the exponents plus one multiply to 5. Since 5 is prime, the only possible way is that there's only one prime factor, and its exponent plus one is 5. Because if there were two primes, say, then (a+1)(b+1)=5, but 5 can't be broken into two factors except 5 and 1. So one of the exponents would have to be 4, and the other 0. But an exponent of 0 means that prime isn't present. So effectively, it's just a single prime raised to the 4th power.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. If there's only one prime factor, then the number of factors is (a+1) =5. So a must be 4. So Q is p^4. So in that case, Q would be the fourth power of a prime. That would make statement II correct. But wait, the first statement says Q is the square of a prime. So that would be p^2, but that would have (2+1)=3 factors, right? No, wait, 3 factors would be p\u00b2, which is correct for 3 factors. But in our case, Q has 5 factors, so a must be 4. So Q is p^4, which would mean statement II is correct, and I is wrong.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check. If a number has exactly 5 factors, what must it be? Because 5 is prime, the number of factors is 5, which comes from exponents plus one. So yes, the only possibility is a single prime raised to the 4th power. So that would make statement I incorrect and II correct.\n\nBut wait, wait. Another thought: Oh! Wait, wait, wait. No, I think I made a mistake. Because sometimes, when you have a number like p^4, the factors are 1, p, p\u00b2, p\u00b3, p^4. That's five factors. So Q is the fourth power of a prime. So statement II is correct, but statement I says it's the square of a prime. The square of a prime is p\u00b2, which would have 3 factors (1, p, p\u00b2). So statement I would be wrong in this case because Q is p^4, not p^2. So statement I is false.\n\nBut wait, what about statement III? Statement III says Q is the product of two primes. So that would be if Q had two distinct prime factors, each to the first power. For example, p*q. Then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1) =4. So 4 factors. But our Q has 5 factors, so statement III is false as well. So only statement II is correct.\n\nWait, but looking back, let me make sure I'm not confusing anything. Let me list the possibilities for the number of factors:\n\n- If a number is p^4, then factors are 1, p, p\u00b2, p\u00b3, p^4 \u2192 5 factors. So yes, this fits.\n\n- If a number is p^2, factors are 1, p, p\u00b2 \u2192 3 factors.\n\n- If a number is p*q (two distinct primes), factors are 1, p, q, pq \u2192 4 factors.\n\nSo in our case, Q must be p^4, so statement II is correct. So looking at the options:\n\nOptions are:\n\nA) I only \u2192 only statement I is true. But in our case, statement II is true, so A is wrong.\n\nB) III only \u2192 statement III is wrong, so B is wrong.\n\nC) II only \u2192 correct, because only II is true.\n\nD) I and II only \u2192 No, because I is not true.\n\nE) I and III only \u2192 Both are wrong.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Another possibility: What if Q is the product of a prime squared and another prime? Like p\u00b2 * q. Then the number of factors would be (2+1)(1+1) = 3*2=6 factors. But we need exactly 5, so that doesn't fit. So that's not possible.\n\nSo yes, the only way to get exactly five factors is to have a single prime raised to the fourth power. So statements I and III are incorrect, only II is correct. So the answer is C.\n\n\nTo determine which statements about \\( Q \\) must be true, we analyze the number of factors \\( Q \\) has. The number of factors of a positive integer is determined by its prime factorization. If \\( Q \\) has a prime factorization of the form \\( Q = p_1^{a} p_2^{b} p_3^{c} \\dots \\), the total number of factors is given by \\( (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)\\dots \\).

Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nThe question says that Q is a positive integer with exactly 5 factors. I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Right, the formula for the number of factors is based on the exponents in the prime factors. \n\nSo, if a number N can be expressed as N = p1^a * p2^b * p3^c ..., then the number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc. Each exponent is increased by one and then multiplied together.\n\nIn this case, Q has 5 factors. Hmm, 5 is a prime number, so the only way to write 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 = 5 * 1. So that means that in the formula for the number of factors, there must be only one term because all the others would be 1. So the exponents plus one multiplied together must equal 5. That implies that Q must be of the form p^4, where p is a prime number. Because 4+1=5, so (4) exponent.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. Because 5 could also be 5*1, but if there were more than one prime factor, each with their exponents, then the product would have to be 5. But 5 is prime, so the only possible way is one exponent plus one is 5, and others are 1. So that means Q must be p^4, where p is prime. Because if it were p^a * q^b, then (a+1)(b+1)=5. Since 5 is prime, one of them must be 5, and the other must be 1. So either a+1=5 and b+1=1, which means a=4 and b=0, or vice versa. But since exponents can't be negative, the other exponents would be zero, meaning that prime doesn't exist in the factorization. So that implies Q is just a single prime raised to the 4th power.\n\nSo that would mean Q is the fourth power of a prime number. So statement II says that, right? Let me check the statements.\n\nStatement I: Q is the square of a prime number. Well, if Q is p^4, then it's also (p^2)^2, which is a square. But wait, is that correct? Because p^4 is indeed a square of p squared. But wait, the square of a prime is p^2. So p^4 is the square of p squared, which is a square, but not the square of a prime. Because p squared is a composite number (if p is prime, then p squared is not prime). Wait, but the statement says \"the square of a prime number.\" So, if Q is p^4, is it the square of a prime? Let's see, p is prime, so p^2 is not prime. So the square would be p^2, but that's not prime. So Q being p^4 is (p^2)^2, but p^2 isn't prime. So statement I would be false in this case.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify. Statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So if Q is p^4, then is that equal to (prime)^2? No, because p^4 is (p^2)^2. So unless p^2 is a prime, which it isn't (since p is a prime, p^2 is composite), then Q is not the square of a prime. So statement I would be false. But wait, no, wait. Wait, if Q is p^4, then the square root of Q is p^2, which is not a prime. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So that would be false. So statement I is false.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the number of factors is 5 only when Q is p^4. So in that case, statement II is true. So statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime, which is correct. So statement II is true.\n\nWhat about statement III? It says Q is the product of two prime numbers. So Q = p * q, where p and q are primes. But if Q is p^4, then it's not a product of two primes, because it's a single prime raised to the fourth. So statement III is false.\n\nSo which of the statements are correct? Only statement II is correct.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me think again about the number of factors.\n\nSo for a number to have exactly 5 factors, the number of factors formula must yield 5. The formula is (e1 +1)(e2 +1)... for each prime exponent in the factorization.\n\nSince 5 is a prime, the only way to write it as a product is 5 * 1. So that means that the exponents must be 4 and 0 for the primes. But 0 exponents mean that prime is not present. So the only prime is to the 4th power. So Q must be p^4. So that makes statement II correct, and statement I incorrect because p^4 is not the square of a prime (it's the square of p^2, which isn't prime), and statement III is incorrect because it's a single prime power, not a product of two primes.\n\nWait, but wait again. What if there's another way to get 5 factors? Let's see. Suppose Q is the product of two distinct primes, p and q. Then the number of factors is (1+1)(1+1)=4. So that's four factors. So that's not 5. So if Q is the product of two primes, it has four factors. So statement III is wrong because it would lead to four factors, not five.\n\nAnother possibility: What if Q is p^2? Then the number of factors is 2+1=3. So that's three factors. So that's not 5.\n\nSo the only way to get 5 factors is when Q is p^4. So statement II is correct.\n\nSo the statements:\n\nI.

It says, if Q is a positive integer with 5 factors, which of the statements I, II, or III must be true about Q?\n\nThe options are A to E, each combining different statements. I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. So I should probably start by recalling how that works.\n\nWait, right! If a number Q has a prime factorization of Q = p1^a * p2^b * p3^c... then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc. So each exponent is increased by one and multiplied together.\n\nIn this case, Q has exactly 5 factors. Hmm, 5 is a prime number. So the product of (a+1)(b+1)... must equal 5. Since 5 is prime, the only way this can happen is if there's only one term in the product, right? Because if there were two terms, like (a+1)(b+1) = 5, then 5 is prime so one of them would have to be 1 and the other 5. Wait, but if a+1 is 1, then a=0, meaning that prime isn't actually in the factorization. So that leaves only one possible term.\n\nSo the prime factorization must be of the form p^4. Because if Q is p^4, then the number of factors is 4+1=5. That makes sense. So Q is the fourth power of a prime number.\n\nWait, but let me check the options. The statements are I: Q is the square of a prime. II: Q is the fourth power of a prime. III: Q is the product of two primes.\n\nSo from my analysis, Q must be p^4, which would make statement II true. So II is true. What about the others?\n\nStatement I says Q is the square of a prime. Well, p^4 is (p^2)^2, so it's a square of p squared, which is itself a prime. But wait, no\u2014p is a prime, p squared is a composite number, so Q would be the square of a composite. So statement I is not necessarily true because Q is p^4, which is (p^2)^2, but p^2 is composite. So I is not true because statement I specifies that it's the square of a prime, not a square of any number.\n\nWait, no, I'm getting confused. Wait, statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So Q = (prime)^2. But in our case, Q is (prime)^4. So unless the prime is squared again, that's not the case. So statement I is not necessarily true. Wait, wait, no\u2014wait, if p is a prime, then p^4 is (p^2)^2. But p^2 is not a prime; it's composite. So statement I is not correct because Q is p^4, which is a square of a composite, not a prime. So statement I is false.\n\nStatement III says Q is the product of two primes. So like Q = p * q, where p and q are primes. But the number of factors for that would be (1+1)(1+1) = 4. So 4 factors, which is not our case. So if Q is product of two primes, it has four factors, but our case is five. So statement III is false.\n\nSo looking at the statements: only statement II is true. So the correct answer is option C, which says II only.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Are there any other possibilities? Because I remember that the number of factors is determined by the exponents in the prime factorization. Since 5 is prime, the only way to write 5 as a product is 5\u00d71. So the exponents plus one must be 5 and 1. That means the number has only one prime factor with exponent 4, and no others.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me read it again. It says, if Q is a positive integer with 5 factors, which of the statements I, II, or III must be true about Q?\n\nThe options are A to E, each combining different statements. I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. So I should probably start by recalling how that works.\n\nWait, right! If a number Q has a prime factorization of Q = p1^a * p2^b * p3^c... then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc. So each exponent is increased by one and multiplied together.\n\nIn this case, Q has exactly 5 factors. Hmm, 5 is a prime number. So the product of (a+1)(b+1)... must equal 5. Since 5 is prime, the only way this can happen is if there's only one term in the product, right? Because if there were two terms, like (a+1)(b+1) = 5, then 5 is prime so one of them would have to be 1 and the other 5. Wait, but if a+1 is 1, then a=0, meaning that prime isn't actually in the factorization. So that leaves only one possible term.\n\nSo the prime factorization must be of the form p^4. Because if Q is p^4, then the number of factors is 4+1=5. That makes sense. So Q is the fourth power of a prime number.\n\nWait, but let me check the options. The statements are I: Q is the square of a prime. II: Q is the fourth power of a prime. III: Q is the product of two primes.\n\nSo from my analysis, Q must be p^4, which would make statement II true. So II is true. What about the others?\n\nStatement I says Q is the square of a prime. Well, p^4 is (p^2)^2, so it's a square of p squared, which is itself a prime. But wait, no\u2014p is a prime, p squared is a composite number, so Q would be the square of a composite. So statement I is not necessarily true because Q is p^4, which is (p^2)^2, but p^2 is composite. So I is not true because statement I specifies that it's the square of a prime, not a square of any number.\n\nWait, no, I'm getting confused. Wait, statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So Q = (prime)^2. But in our case, Q is (prime)^4. So unless the prime is squared again, that's not the case. So statement I is not necessarily true. Wait, wait, no\u2014wait, if p is a prime, then p^4 is (p^2)^2. But p^2 is not a prime; it's composite. So statement I is not correct because Q is p^4, which is a square of a composite, not a prime. So statement I is false.\n\nStatement III says Q is the product of two primes. So like Q = p * q, where p and q are primes. But the number of factors for that would be (1+1)(1+1) = 4. So 4 factors, which is not our case. So if Q is product of two primes, it has four factors, but our case is five. So statement III is false.\n\nSo looking at the statements: only statement II is true. So the correct answer is option C, which says II only.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Are there any other possibilities? Because I remember that the number of factors is determined by the exponents in the prime factorization. Since 5 is prime, the only way to write 5 as a product is 5\u00d71. So the exponents plus one must be 5 and 1. That means the number has only one prime factor with exponent 4, and no others. So yeah, Q must be p^4. So only statement II is correct.\n\nSo the options are A) I only, B) III only, C) II only, etc. So the answer should be C.\n\n\nIf \\( Q \\) is a positive integer with exactly 5 factors, we analyze the number of factors formula. For a number \\( Q \\) with prime factorization \\( Q = p_1^{a} p_2^{b} p_3^{c} \\dots \\), the total number of factors is given by \\( (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)\\dots \\).

This implies that \\( Q \\) must have a single prime factor with an exponent of 4, i.e., \\( Q = p^4 \\), where \\( p \\) is a prime number.\n\nNow, we evaluate the statements:\n\n1. **Statement I**: \\( Q \\) is the square of a prime number.  \n   \\( Q = p^4 \\) is not the square of a prime number because \\( p^4 = (p^2)^2 \\), and \\( p^2 \\) is composite.

I need to determine which of the statements I, II, or III must be true about Q.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Oh right, the formula for the number of factors! So, if a number N has a prime factorization of N = p1^a * p2^b * ... pn^k, then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)...(k+1). Right, so each exponent is increased by one and multiplied together.\n\nIn this case, Q has 5 factors. So, the product of (exponents + 1) equals 5. Now, 5 is a prime number, so the only way to write it as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 itself. So, that would mean that the exponents in the prime factorization must satisfy (a+1) =5, and all other exponents must be zero, right? Because if there were more than one prime factor, the product would have more than one term, leading to a number greater than 5.\n\nWait, so that would imply that Q is a prime raised to the 4th power, because a+1=5 means a=4. So, Q = p^4, where p is a prime. Let me think, because if it's p^4, then the factors are 1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4. That's 5 factors. So, statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Wait, if Q is p squared, then the number of factors would be (2+1) = 3, right? So that's only three factors. But we need five. So statement I would be false, unless I'm missing something.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, if Q is the square of a prime, that's p^2, which has three factors. So I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me go back. Oh no, wait, wait, the number of factors is (exponent +1) for each prime. So if Q is p^4, then the number of factors is 4+1=5. So that's correct. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime, which would be p^2, which gives 3 factors. So statement I is not necessarily true? Or wait, statement I says Q is the square of a prime. But if Q is p^4, then it's not the square of a prime. Wait, wait, no. Wait, p^4 is (p^2)^2. So is that considered the square of a prime? No, because p^2 is not a prime. So statement I is incorrect.\n\nWait, so statement I is wrong. Then statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime. That seems correct because Q = p^4 would fit. So statement II is true.\n\nWhat about statement III? III says Q is the product of two primes. So, if Q is the product of two distinct primes, say p and q, then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1)=4. But we need 5 factors. So that can't be the case. Alternatively, if Q is p^4, then it's a single prime raised to the fourth power, not a product of two primes. So statement III is not true either.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. So, the number of factors is 5. So the only way is that Q has a single prime factor with exponent 4. So, it's p^4. Therefore, statement II is correct, statement I is incorrect because p^4 is not the square of a prime, and statement III is incorrect because it's not a product of two primes.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me check. Let's take some examples. Suppose Q is 16, which is 2^4. The factors are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16. Five factors. So Q=16 fits. So 16 is the fourth power of a prime (2). So statement II is correct. Is 16 the square of a prime? The square of a prime would be (2^2)=4, but 4 is 2 squared, which has three factors. Wait, no, 16 is (2^2)^2, which is 2^4. So 16 is the square of 4, but 4 is not a prime. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So 16 is not the square of a prime; it's the square of a composite number. So statement I is false.\n\nAnother example: Let me think of another number with five factors. Like 81, which is 3^4. Its factors are 1,3,9,27,81. Five factors. So again, Q is p^4, so statement II holds.\n\nWait, but what about Q being p^2 * q^2? No, that would have (2+1)(2+1)=9 factors, which is more than 5. So that's not the case.\n\nSo, looking back at the options, I is incorrect, II is correct, and III is incorrect.

But the original options are:\n\nA) I only\nB) III only\nC) II only\nD) I and II only\nE) I and III only\n\nSo the answer should be option C.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that statement I is incorrect.

The options are A to E, each combining different statements.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. So, if a number has a prime factorization of, say, p^a * q^b, then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1). Wait, right. Because each exponent can range from 0 up to the exponent in the prime factorization.\n\nSo, in this case, Q has 5 factors. I need to find out what the structure of Q must be. Since 5 is a prime number, the only way to write it as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 itself. So that means that (a+1)(b+1) must equal 5. But since 5 is prime, the only possibility is that one of the terms is 5 and the others are 1. So that implies that Q is of the form p^4, because a+1=5 implies a=4. Alternatively, if Q had two different primes, like p^1 * q^1, then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1)=4, which is less than 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. So, if Q has exactly 5 factors, it can only be written as p^4, because 5 is a prime number. So the exponents plus one must multiply to 5, and since 5 is prime, it's only possible if there's a single prime factor with exponent 4. So that would make the number of factors (4+1)=5.\n\nSo, that means Q must be the fourth power of a prime. So looking at the statements:\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime number. Well, if Q is p^4, then the square of a prime would be p^2. So p^4 is (p^2)^2, which is a square. So I think statement I is true because p^4 is a square. Because any number to an even power is a square. So yes, I is true.\n\nII. Q is the fourth power of a prime number. Well, that's exactly what we concluded. So II is definitely true.\n\nIII. Q is the product of two prime numbers. Wait, if Q is p^4, then it's p multiplied by itself four times, but that's not a product of two different primes. It's the same prime. So the product of two primes would be p * q, which would have (1+1)(1+1)=4 factors, which is less than 5. So III is not true because Q is not a product of two primes; it's a single prime raised to the fourth power.\n\nWait, but wait. What if Q was the product of two primes? Then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1)=4. So since Q has 5 factors, that's not possible.

Well, if Q is p^4, then that's (p^2)^2, which is a square. So yes, I is true. So both I and II are correct, so the answer must be D.\n\nBut wait, the options are A to E. Let me look again. The options are:\n\nA) I only\nB) III only\nC) II only\nD) I and II only\nE) I and III only\n\nSo D says both I and II are true. So the correct answer is D. But wait, the original problem statement says \"must be true about Q.\" So both I and II must be true.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: The number of divisors is 5, which is a prime, so the number must be of the form p^4, because the formula for the number of divisors is (e1 +1)(e2 +1)... etc. So since 5 is prime, it's only possible if there's a single exponent of 4, and others are zero.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe question is about a positive integer Q that has exactly 5 factors. Then it asks which of the statements I, II, or III must be true about Q. The options are A to E, each combining different statements.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. So, if a number has a prime factorization of, say, p^a * q^b, then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1). Wait, right. Because each exponent can range from 0 up to the exponent in the prime factorization.\n\nSo, in this case, Q has 5 factors. I need to find out what the structure of Q must be. Since 5 is a prime number, the only way to write it as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 itself. So that means that (a+1)(b+1) must equal 5. But since 5 is prime, the only possibility is that one of the terms is 5 and the others are 1. So that implies that Q is of the form p^4, because a+1=5 implies a=4. Alternatively, if Q had two different primes, like p^1 * q^1, then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1)=4, which is less than 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. So, if Q has exactly 5 factors, it can only be written as p^4, because 5 is a prime number. So the exponents plus one must multiply to 5, and since 5 is prime, it's only possible if there's a single prime factor with exponent 4. So that would make the number of factors (4+1)=5.\n\nSo, that means Q must be the fourth power of a prime. So looking at the statements:\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime number. Well, if Q is p^4, then the square of a prime would be p^2. So p^4 is (p^2)^2, which is a square. So I think statement I is true because p^4 is a square. Because any number to an even power is a square. So yes, I is true.\n\nII. Q is the fourth power of a prime number. Well, that's exactly what we concluded. So II is definitely true.\n\nIII. Q is the product of two prime numbers. Wait, if Q is p^4, then it's p multiplied by itself four times, but that's not a product of two different primes. It's the same prime. So the product of two primes would be p * q, which would have (1+1)(1+1)=4 factors, which is less than 5. So III is not true because Q is not a product of two primes; it's a single prime raised to the fourth power.\n\nWait, but wait. What if Q was the product of two primes? Then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1)=4. So since Q has 5 factors, that's not possible. So III is definitely false.\n\nSo looking at the statements:\n\nI: True\nII: True\nIII: False\n\nNow, the options are:\n\nA) I only \u2192 So II is true, so A is wrong.\nB) III only \u2192 Both I and II are true, so B is wrong.\nC) II only \u2192 I is also true, so C is wrong.\nD) I and II only \u2192 Both are true. So D would be correct.\nE) I and III only \u2192 III is false, so E is wrong.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check statement I. It says Q is the square of a prime. Well, if Q is p^4, then that's (p^2)^2, which is a square. So yes, I is true. So both I and II are correct, so the answer must be D.\n\nBut wait, the options are A to E. Let me look again. The options are:\n\nA) I only\nB) III only\nC) II only\nD) I and II only\nE) I and III only\n\nSo D says both I and II are true. So the correct answer is D. But wait, the original problem statement says \"must be true about Q.\" So both I and II must be true.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: The number of divisors is 5, which is a prime, so the number must be of the form p^4, because the formula for the number of divisors is (e1 +1)(e2 +1)... etc. So since 5 is prime, it's only possible if there's a single exponent of 4, and others are zero. So yes, Q must be p^4.\n\nSo, I: Q is the square of a prime. p^4 is (p^2)^2, so yes, it's a square of a prime. So I is true.\n\nII: Q is the fourth power of a prime. Yes, because Q is p^4. So II is true.\n\nIII: Product of two primes. No, because that would have (1+1)(1+1)=4 factors. So III is false.\n\nSo the correct statements are I and II, which is option D.\n\n\nTo determine which statements about \\( Q \\) must be true, we analyze the given condition: \\( Q \\) is a positive integer with exactly 5 factors. The number of factors of a positive integer is determined by its prime factorization. If \\( Q \\) has a prime factorization of \\( p^a \\cdot q^b \\), the total number of factors is \\( (a+1)(b+1) \\). Since \\( Q \\) has exactly 5 factors, and 5 is a prime number, the only way to express 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is \\( 5 \\times 1 \\). This implies that \\( Q \\) must be of the form \\( p^4 \\), where \\( p \\) is a prime number.\n\n### Analysis of the Statements:\n1. **Statement I**: \\( Q \\) is the square of a prime number.  \n   Since \\( Q = p^4 \\), it can be written as \\( (p^2)^2 \\), which is indeed the square of a prime number. Therefore, **I is true**.\n\n2. **Statement II**: \\( Q \\) is the fourth power of a prime number.  \n   By definition, \\( Q = p^4 \\), so \\( Q \\) is the fourth power of a prime number. Therefore, **II is true**.\n\n3. **Statement III**: \\( Q \\) is the product of two prime numbers.  \n   If \\( Q \\) were the product of two distinct primes, say \\( p \\cdot q \\), the number of factors would be \\( (1+1)(1+1) = 4 \\), which is less than 5.

Let me read it again: \"If Q, a positive integer, has 5 factors, which of the following must be true about Q?\" Then there are three statements, I, II, III, and the options are combinations of these.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Oh right, if a number Q can be expressed as a product of primes raised to exponents, like Q = p1^a * p2^b * p3^c..., then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc. So each exponent is increased by one and multiplied together.\n\nSo the problem says Q has 5 factors. 5 is a prime number, right? So the product of (exponents +1) must be 5. Since 5 is prime, the only way to write it as a product is 5*1. So the exponents plus one must multiply to 5. That means that in the prime factorization of Q, there's only one prime with an exponent, and the rest (if any) have exponents of 0, which would mean they aren't actually present. So that implies Q is a single prime raised to the 4th power because (4+1)=5. So Q = p^4, where p is prime.\n\nWait, let me think again. Because 5 is prime, the number of factors must come from a single term. So for example, if there was only one prime factor, then the exponent would be 4, because 4+1=5. So Q is the square of a prime squared? Wait, no, wait. p^4 is the square of p squared, but in any case, it's a prime to the fourth power.\n\nSo let's look at the statements.\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime number. Well, the square of a prime is p^2. That would give (2+1)=3 factors, right? So if Q were p^2, it would have 3 factors, not 5. So statement I can't be correct. Wait wait, wait a minute. No, wait. Because I'm getting confused here. Because if Q is p^4, then the number of factors is 5, but p^2 would have 3. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. But p^4 is (p^2)^2, so is that the square of a prime? Wait, no. Because the square of a prime is p^2. So statement I would be correct only if Q is p^2, but in this case, Q is p^4. So statement I is not correct. Wait, but maybe I'm mixing up the terms.\n\nWait, let's clarify. Statement I: Q is the square of a prime. So if Q is p^2, then the number of factors is 3, not 5. So if Q has 5 factors, it's p^4, not p^2. Therefore, statement I is not correct. Hmm, but wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no. Because p^4 is (p^2)^2. So is p^4 considered the square of a prime squared? Or is it considered the fourth power of a prime? Because the square of a prime is p^2, so statement I is not true because Q is p^4, not p^2. So statement I is false.\n\nWait, but wait again. Maybe I'm wrong. Let me think about the exponents. So the number of factors is (e1+1)(e2+1)... For Q to have 5 factors, which is a prime number, the exponents must be such that only one of them is non-zero. Because 5 can't be broken down into other factors except 5*1. So that would mean that Q is p^4, as (4+1)=5.\n\nSo then statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So the square of a prime is p^2. So if Q is p^4, is that the square of a prime? Because p^4 is (p^2)^2, which is the square of p squared. But wait, the square of a prime is p^2. So (p^2) is a prime squared, but p^4 is the square of p^2, which is a composite number, not a prime. So statement I is saying Q is the square of a prime. But p^4 is not the square of a prime; it's the square of a square of a prime. So statement I is false.\n\nWait, but wait another second. Let me think. If I have a prime number p, then p^2 is the square of a prime. So statement I says Q is p^2, but in our case, Q is p^4. So statement I is not correct. So statement I is false.\n\nStatement II: Q is the fourth power of a prime number. Well, that's exactly what we have. Because Q is p^4, so statement II is correct.\n\nStatement III: Q is the product of two prime numbers. The product of two primes would be p*q, where p and q are primes. The number of factors for p*q is (1+1)(1+1)=4. So that gives 4 factors, not 5. So statement III is incorrect.\n\nSo now, looking back at the options. The options are A) I only, B) III only, C) II only, D) I and II only, E) I and III only.\n\nWait, but according to our analysis, statement II is correct, and I and III are incorrect. So the correct answer would be option C) II only.\n\nWait, but wait a moment. Did I make a mistake earlier about statement I? Let me double-check. Statement I says Q is the square of a prime. But if Q is p^4, that's p squared squared. So p squared is a prime squared, but p^4 is (p^2)^2. So is p^4 considered the square of a prime? Because p is a prime, so p^4 is (p^2)^2, which is the square of p squared. So is that the same as being the square of a prime? No, because p squared is not a prime; it's a composite number. So statement I is saying that Q is the square of a prime, which would mean Q is p^2, but our case is p^4, so statement I is false.\n\nSo the only correct statement is II, which is option C.\n",

It says that Q has 5 factors, and we need to determine which of the statements I, II, or III must be true.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has relates to its prime factorization. Let me think. Oh right, if a number is expressed as a product of primes raised to exponents, like Q = p1^a * p2^b * p3^c..., then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc. So for example, if Q is p^2, then the number of factors is (2+1) = 3, right? Because the exponents would be 2, so 2+1 is 3.\n\nIn this problem, Q has 5 factors. So, we need to find what kind of number would result in 5 factors when using the formula. Let me think: 5 is a prime number, so the only way to write 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 itself. So that means the formula (a+1)(b+1)... must equal 5. Since 5 is prime, the only possible way is that there's only one term in the product, which is 5. So that would mean that (a+1) =5, implying that a=4. So Q must be of the form p^4, where p is a prime number.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, because if Q has multiple prime factors, then the number of factors would be the product of each exponent plus one. So for example, if Q was p^a * q^b, then the number of factors is (a+1)(b+1). So if (a+1)(b+1) =5, then since 5 is prime, one of the terms has to be 5, and the others have to be 1. But exponents can't be negative, so the only possible way is that one exponent is 4 (because a+1=5 implies a=4) and the others are zero. But zero exponents would mean that prime isn't actually a factor. So that's not possible. So Q can't have more than one prime factor. So Q must be the power of a single prime number.\n\nSo, the exponents plus one multiply to 5. Since 5 is prime, only one term in the product, meaning Q is p^4. So the number of factors is 5. So Q is the fourth power of a prime.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Because if I have Q as p^4, then the number of factors is 4+1=5. That's correct. So that's statement II: Q is the fourth power of a prime number. So II must be true.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about statement I: Q is the square of a prime. If Q is p squared, then the number of factors is 3. Because (2+1)=3. So that's 3 factors, not 5. So statement I can't be true because it would give 3 factors, not 5. So statement I is false.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. If Q is the square of a prime, that would be p^2, which gives 3 factors. So for Q to have 5 factors, it must be p^4. So statement I is incorrect, statement II is correct.\n\nWhat about statement III: Q is the product of two prime numbers. So if Q is p*q, where p and q are primes, then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1)=4. Because each exponent is 1, so (1+1)*(1+1)=4. So 4 factors. But the problem says Q has 5 factors, which is not 4. So statement III is incorrect. So only statement II is correct.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused here. Let me double-check. Let me list the options again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime number. So p\u00b2, which has 3 factors. So for 5 factors, this is not possible. So I is false.\n\nII. Q is the fourth power of a prime. So p\u2074, which has 5 factors. So II is correct.\n\nIII. Q is the product of two primes. So p*q, which has 4 factors. So III is incorrect.\n\nSo the correct statements are only II. So looking at the options, option C is II only. Option A is I only, which is wrong. Option E is I and III, which is wrong because both I and III are incorrect.\n\nWait, but wait, I'm getting conflicting information. Because I thought that the number of factors formula applies to the exponents. So let me think again.\n\nIf Q has 5 factors, which is 5, a prime number. So the only way to write 5 as a product is 5=5\u00d71. So the exponents plus one must be 5 and 1. But exponents can't be zero for primes that are part of the factorization. So the only possibility is that there's one prime factor with exponent 4. So Q must be p^4. So only II is correct.\n\nSo the statements are:\n\nI. False\n\nII. True\n\nIII. False\n\nSo the only correct statement is II. So the answer should be option C) II only.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is I only, which is wrong. Option C is II only, which is correct.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused because in some resources I've read, the number of factors for p^4 is 5, which is correct.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it again and try to figure it out step by step. The question is about the number of factors a positive integer Q has. It says that Q has 5 factors, and we need to determine which of the statements I, II, or III must be true.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has relates to its prime factorization. Let me think. Oh right, if a number is expressed as a product of primes raised to exponents, like Q = p1^a * p2^b * p3^c..., then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc. So for example, if Q is p^2, then the number of factors is (2+1) = 3, right? Because the exponents would be 2, so 2+1 is 3.\n\nIn this problem, Q has 5 factors. So, we need to find what kind of number would result in 5 factors when using the formula. Let me think: 5 is a prime number, so the only way to write 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 itself. So that means the formula (a+1)(b+1)... must equal 5. Since 5 is prime, the only possible way is that there's only one term in the product, which is 5. So that would mean that (a+1) =5, implying that a=4. So Q must be of the form p^4, where p is a prime number.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, because if Q has multiple prime factors, then the number of factors would be the product of each exponent plus one. So for example, if Q was p^a * q^b, then the number of factors is (a+1)(b+1). So if (a+1)(b+1) =5, then since 5 is prime, one of the terms has to be 5, and the others have to be 1. But exponents can't be negative, so the only possible way is that one exponent is 4 (because a+1=5 implies a=4) and the others are zero. But zero exponents would mean that prime isn't actually a factor. So that's not possible. So Q can't have more than one prime factor. So Q must be the power of a single prime number.\n\nSo, the exponents plus one multiply to 5. Since 5 is prime, only one term in the product, meaning Q is p^4. So the number of factors is 5. So Q is the fourth power of a prime.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Because if I have Q as p^4, then the number of factors is 4+1=5. That's correct. So that's statement II: Q is the fourth power of a prime number. So II must be true.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about statement I: Q is the square of a prime. If Q is p squared, then the number of factors is 3. Because (2+1)=3. So that's 3 factors, not 5. So statement I can't be true because it would give 3 factors, not 5. So statement I is false.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. If Q is the square of a prime, that would be p^2, which gives 3 factors. So for Q to have 5 factors, it must be p^4. So statement I is incorrect, statement II is correct.\n\nWhat about statement III: Q is the product of two prime numbers. So if Q is p*q, where p and q are primes, then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1)=4. Because each exponent is 1, so (1+1)*(1+1)=4. So 4 factors. But the problem says Q has 5 factors, which is not 4. So statement III is incorrect. So only statement II is correct.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused here. Let me double-check. Let me list the options again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime number. So p\u00b2, which has 3 factors. So for 5 factors, this is not possible. So I is false.\n\nII. Q is the fourth power of a prime. So p\u2074, which has 5 factors. So II is correct.\n\nIII. Q is the product of two primes. So p*q, which has 4 factors. So III is incorrect.\n\nSo the correct statements are only II. So looking at the options, option C is II only. Option A is I only, which is wrong. Option E is I and III, which is wrong because both I and III are incorrect.\n\nWait, but wait, I'm getting conflicting information. Because I thought that the number of factors formula applies to the exponents. So let me think again.\n\nIf Q has 5 factors, which is 5, a prime number. So the only way to write 5 as a product is 5=5\u00d71. So the exponents plus one must be 5 and 1. But exponents can't be zero for primes that are part of the factorization. So the only possibility is that there's one prime factor with exponent 4. So Q must be p^4. So only II is correct.\n\nSo the statements are:\n\nI. False\n\nII. True\n\nIII. False\n\nSo the only correct statement is II. So the answer should be option C) II only.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is I only, which is wrong. Option C is II only, which is correct.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused because in some resources I've read, the number of factors for p^4 is 5, which is correct. So yes, Q must be the fourth power of a prime.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C.\n\n\nTo determine which statements about \\( Q \\) must be true, we analyze the number of factors \\( Q \\) has. The number of factors of a positive integer is determined by its prime factorization. If \\( Q = p_1^{a} p_2^{b} p_3^{c} \\dots \\), the total number of factors is given by \\( (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)\\dots \\).

Oh right, if a number Q can be expressed as a product of primes raised to exponents, like Q = p1^a * p2^b * p3^c ..., then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc. So each exponent is increased by one and multiplied together.\n\nIn this case, Q has exactly 5 factors. Hmm, 5 is a prime number, so the only way to express 5 as a product is 5 = 5 * 1. That means the exponents plus one must multiply to 5. So the possible exponents for the prime factors would be 4 (since 4+1=5) and 0 for others, because if there were more primes, their exponents would add to the product, which would make the total number of factors more than 5.\n\nWait, let me make sure. So if Q has only one prime factor, then the exponent of that prime would be 4 because 4+1=5. So Q would be p^4, right? Or wait, no, if the number of factors is 5, then the exponents plus one multiply to 5. Since 5 is prime, the only way is one exponent of 4, and others zero. So Q must be the fourth power of a prime. But wait, I thought that the square of a prime has 3 factors. Let me check that.\n\nYes, the square of a prime, say p^2, has factors 1, p, and p^2. So that's 3 factors. So if Q had 3 factors, it would be p squared. But in this case, Q has 5 factors, so that's p to the fourth power. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. That's p^2, which gives 3 factors, not 5. So statement I is not correct? Or am I mixing something up?\n\nWait, no, I think I got it. Because if Q is the square of a prime, it would have 3 factors. But for 5 factors, it needs to be the fourth power. So statement I is wrong. So statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime, which would be correct. So II is true.\n\nWait, but what about statement III? Statement III says Q is the product of two primes. So if Q were, say, p * q, where p and q are primes, then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1) =4, right? Because each exponent is 1, so (1+1)(1+1)=4. So 4 factors. But Q has 5, which is more than 4. So III would not be correct. So III is false.\n\nWait, but what if Q is the product of two primes, but one of them is squared? Like p^2 * q. Then the number of factors would be (2+1)(1+1)=3*2=6. So that's 6 factors. So that's more than 5. So if Q has 5 factors, it can't be the product of two primes, whether they are distinct or not. So III is false.\n\nSo putting it all together: Only statement II is correct. So looking at the options, option C is II only. Wait, but let me check the statements again.\n\nWait, statement I: Q is the square of a prime. That would give 3 factors, which doesn't match. So I is incorrect. Statement II: Q is the fourth power of a prime. So Q = p^4, which would have 5 factors (1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4). So II is correct. Statement III: product of two primes. Which gives 4 factors, which is incorrect. So only II is correct.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option C is II only, which would be correct. But wait, the options are:\n\nA) I only\n\nB) III only\n\nC) II only\n\nD) I and II only\n\nE) I and III only\n\nSo the correct answer would be option C. But wait, another thought: is there another way for a number to have 5 factors?\n\nWait, 5 is a prime number, so the only way for the product of (exponents+1) to be 5 is if there's only one exponent of 4, because 5 can't be broken down into smaller factors except 5 and 1. So Q must have exactly one prime factor with exponent 4, and no others. So yes, Q must be p^4, which is the fourth power of a prime.\n\nSo among the options, only II is correct.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let's read it again carefully. It says, \"If Q, a positive integer, has 5 factors, which of the following must be true about Q?\" Then it gives three statements: I, II, and III. The options are A to E, each combining these statements in different ways.\n\nHmm. So I need to figure out what Q must be like if it has exactly 5 factors. I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Right, the formula for the number of factors is based on the exponents in the prime factors. \n\nWait, how does that work again? Oh right, if a number N can be expressed as N = p\u2081^a * p\u2082^b * p\u2083^c ... , where p's are primes, then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc. Because each exponent can range from 0 up to its maximum in the factors.\n\nSo in this case, Q has 5 factors. Let me think, 5 is a prime number. So the product (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... must equal 5. Since 5 is prime, the only way to write it as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 \u00d7 1. So that means that the exponents plus one must multiply to 5. So there's only one way: one of the exponents is 4 (because 4+1=5), and the others, if any, are zero. Because if there were more than one prime factor, like two primes, then each exponent would have to be at least 1, and (a+1)(b+1) would have to be 5, but 5 can't be broken into a product of two numbers both greater than 1, except 5\u00d71. But wait, for two primes, the exponents would be a and b, and (a+1)(b+1)=5. Let's see, possible options: a=4, b=0. But if b is zero, that would mean the second prime isn't present, so the number would just be a single prime raised to the 4th power.\n\nWait, no, if the number has two primes, like p and q, then their exponents would be a and b. So (a+1)(b+1) =5. The possibilities would be a+1=5 and b+1=1, meaning a=4, b=0. But that would mean that the second prime's exponent is zero, which would imply that it's not present. So in reality, the number can't have more than one prime factor because that would require another exponent beyond zero, which would mean the product would have more than one term. So, the only way is that Q is the power of a single prime. \n\nSo the exponents plus one multiply to 5, which is prime, so only one exponent plus one equals 5, and the rest are 1. So that exponent is 4. So Q must be p^4, where p is a prime number. \n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime number. Hmm. If Q is p^4, then the square of a prime would be p\u00b2. So is p^4 equal to the square of a prime? Let me think. Wait, the square of a prime is p\u00b2, but p^4 is (p\u00b2)\u00b2, which is the square of p\u00b2, which is a square number, but not just the square of a prime. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. If Q is p^4, then it's the fourth power of a prime, but not the square. Wait, no. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Suppose p is 3, then p^4 is 81. Is 81 the square of a prime? 81 is 9\u00b2, and 9 is not a prime (since it's 3\u00b2). So Q would be the square of a composite number, not a prime. So statement I is not necessarily true. Because if Q is p^4, then it's the fourth power, not the square. So statement I is false.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. What if p is a prime, then p^4 is (p\u00b2)^2. So p\u00b2 is a square of a prime, so Q is the square of p\u00b2. But p\u00b2 isn't a prime, it's a square of a prime. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So in that case, if Q is p^4, then it's the square of p\u00b2, which is not a prime. So statement I is false.\n\nSo I is false. So any options that include I being true are incorrect. So options A, D, E are out.\n\nWait, but let's make sure. Maybe I made a mistake. Let's consider an example. Let's take Q=16. 16 has factors 1, 2,4,8,16. So 5 factors. So Q=16=2^4. Is 16 the square of a prime? The square of a prime would be, say, 3^2=9. 16 is 4^2, but 4 is not a prime. So no, 16 is not the square of a prime. So statement I is false in this case.\n\nSo statement I is not true.\n\nWhat about statement II: Q is the fourth power of a prime number. Well, from our earlier analysis, Q must be p^4. So yes, statement II is true.\n\nStatement III: Q is the product of two primes. Well, the product of two primes would be p*q, where p and q are primes. The number of factors for p*q is (1+1)(1+1)=4, because exponents are 1 and 1. So number of factors is 4. But Q has 5 factors, so statement III is false. So Q cannot be the product of two primes because that would give four factors. So statement III is false.\n\nSo looking back at the options:\n\nI. False.\n\nII. True.\n\nIII. False.\n\nSo which option has only II as true? Looking at the options:\n\nA) I only \u2192 incorrect.\n\nB) III only \u2192 incorrect.\n\nC) II only \u2192 correct.\n\nD) I and II \u2192 incorrect.\n\nE) I and III \u2192 incorrect.\n\nSo the correct answer must be option C, which states only II is true.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Let me make sure. What if Q is p^4, then it's the fourth power of a prime. So II is correct. But could there be other possibilities?\n\nAnother example: Let's take Q=81. 81=3^4. Its factors are 1,3,9,27,81 \u2192 5 factors. So yes, II is correct. Also, another example: 16=2^4, which is correct. So II is always true.\n\nWhat about statement I: Q is the square of a prime. Well, as in the examples, Q is p^4, which is not a square of a prime (because the square of a prime is p^2, not p^4). So I is false. So the only correct statement is II. So the correct option is C.\n",

Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: C**",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let's read it again carefully. It says, \"If Q, a positive integer, has 5 factors, which of the following must be true about Q?\" Then it gives three statements: I, II, and III. The options are A to E, each combining these statements in different ways.\n\nHmm. So I need to figure out what Q must be like if it has exactly 5 factors. I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Right, the formula for the number of factors is based on the exponents in the prime factors. \n\nWait, how does that work again? Oh right, if a number N can be expressed as N = p\u2081^a * p\u2082^b * p\u2083^c ... , where p's are primes, then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc. Because each exponent can range from 0 up to its maximum in the factors.\n\nSo in this case, Q has 5 factors. Let me think, 5 is a prime number. So the product (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... must equal 5. Since 5 is prime, the only way to write it as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 \u00d7 1. So that means that the exponents plus one must multiply to 5. So there's only one way: one of the exponents is 4 (because 4+1=5), and the others, if any, are zero. Because if there were more than one prime factor, like two primes, then each exponent would have to be at least 1, and (a+1)(b+1) would have to be 5, but 5 can't be broken into a product of two numbers both greater than 1, except 5\u00d71. But wait, for two primes, the exponents would be a and b, and (a+1)(b+1)=5. Let's see, possible options: a=4, b=0. But if b is zero, that would mean the second prime isn't present, so the number would just be a single prime raised to the 4th power.\n\nWait, no, if the number has two primes, like p and q, then their exponents would be a and b. So (a+1)(b+1) =5. The possibilities would be a+1=5 and b+1=1, meaning a=4, b=0. But that would mean that the second prime's exponent is zero, which would imply that it's not present. So in reality, the number can't have more than one prime factor because that would require another exponent beyond zero, which would mean the product would have more than one term. So, the only way is that Q is the power of a single prime. \n\nSo the exponents plus one multiply to 5, which is prime, so only one exponent plus one equals 5, and the rest are 1. So that exponent is 4. So Q must be p^4, where p is a prime number. \n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime number. Hmm. If Q is p^4, then the square of a prime would be p\u00b2. So is p^4 equal to the square of a prime? Let me think. Wait, the square of a prime is p\u00b2, but p^4 is (p\u00b2)\u00b2, which is the square of p\u00b2, which is a square number, but not just the square of a prime. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. If Q is p^4, then it's the fourth power of a prime, but not the square. Wait, no. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Suppose p is 3, then p^4 is 81. Is 81 the square of a prime? 81 is 9\u00b2, and 9 is not a prime (since it's 3\u00b2). So Q would be the square of a composite number, not a prime. So statement I is not necessarily true. Because if Q is p^4, then it's the fourth power, not the square. So statement I is false.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. What if p is a prime, then p^4 is (p\u00b2)^2. So p\u00b2 is a square of a prime, so Q is the square of p\u00b2. But p\u00b2 isn't a prime, it's a square of a prime. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So in that case, if Q is p^4, then it's the square of p\u00b2, which is not a prime. So statement I is false.\n\nSo I is false. So any options that include I being true are incorrect. So options A, D, E are out.\n\nWait, but let's make sure. Maybe I made a mistake. Let's consider an example. Let's take Q=16. 16 has factors 1, 2,4,8,16. So 5 factors. So Q=16=2^4. Is 16 the square of a prime? The square of a prime would be, say, 3^2=9. 16 is 4^2, but 4 is not a prime. So no, 16 is not the square of a prime. So statement I is false in this case.\n\nSo statement I is not true.\n\nWhat about statement II: Q is the fourth power of a prime number. Well, from our earlier analysis, Q must be p^4. So yes, statement II is true.\n\nStatement III: Q is the product of two primes. Well, the product of two primes would be p*q, where p and q are primes. The number of factors for p*q is (1+1)(1+1)=4, because exponents are 1 and 1. So number of factors is 4. But Q has 5 factors, so statement III is false. So Q cannot be the product of two primes because that would give four factors. So statement III is false.\n\nSo looking back at the options:\n\nI. False.\n\nII. True.\n\nIII. False.\n\nSo which option has only II as true? Looking at the options:\n\nA) I only \u2192 incorrect.\n\nB) III only \u2192 incorrect.\n\nC) II only \u2192 correct.\n\nD) I and II \u2192 incorrect.\n\nE) I and III \u2192 incorrect.\n\nSo the correct answer must be option C, which states only II is true.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Let me make sure. What if Q is p^4, then it's the fourth power of a prime. So II is correct. But could there be other possibilities?\n\nAnother example: Let's take Q=81. 81=3^4. Its factors are 1,3,9,27,81 \u2192 5 factors. So yes, II is correct. Also, another example: 16=2^4, which is correct. So II is always true.\n\nWhat about statement I: Q is the square of a prime. Well, as in the examples, Q is p^4, which is not a square of a prime (because the square of a prime is p^2, not p^4). So I is false. So the only correct statement is II. So the correct option is C.\n\n\nIf a positive integer \\( Q \\) has exactly 5 factors, we can determine its structure based on the formula for the number of factors. The number of factors of \\( Q \\), expressed as \\( Q = p_1^{a} p_2^{b} p_3^{c} \\dots \\), is given by \\( (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)\\dots \\).

It says Q has 5 factors, and I need to determine which of the statements I, II, or III must be true about Q. The options are A to E, each combining different statements.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Oh right! The formula for the number of divisors (factors) of a number is based on its prime exponents. Like, if a number N has a prime factorization of N = p1^a * p2^b * p3^c..., then the number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... and so on for each prime factor.\n\nSo, in this case, Q has exactly 5 factors. 5 is a prime number, so the product of the (exponents +1) must equal 5. Let me think about the possible ways to get 5 as a product. Well, 5 is prime, so the only way is 5 = 5 * 1. So, the exponents plus one must multiply to 5.\n\nThat means, for Q's prime factors, the exponents can be arranged such that one of them is 4 (since 4+1=5) and the others are 0 (since 0+1=1, but exponents can't be zero in the prime factorization, right? Wait, no, because if a prime doesn't appear, its exponent is zero. So, in terms of the formula, any prime not present contributes a (0+1)=1 factor. So, the overall product only considers the primes that are present.\n\nWait, no. If a prime isn't present, it doesn't contribute to the product because it's not part of the factorization. So, for example, if Q is p^4, then the number of factors is (4+1) =5. Alternatively, if Q is p^4 * q^0, but that's the same as p^4, since q^0 is 1. So, the only way for the product of (a+1)(b+1)... to be 5 is that there's exactly one prime factor with exponent 4, and no others. Because if there were more than one, like p^2 * q^2, that would give (2+1)(2+1)=9 factors, which is more than 5.\n\nSo, that means Q must be the fourth power of a single prime number. Because if you have more than one prime factor, the number of factors would be higher than 5. For example, if Q is p^4 * q, then the number of factors would be (4+1)(1+1) =5*2=10, which is more than 5. So that can't be.\n\nWait, let me think again. So the exponents plus one multiply to 5. The only possibilities are that there's a single prime raised to the 4th power. Because 5 is prime, so no other combinations. So, that would make statement I: Q is the square of a prime number. Wait, is that correct? Because 4 is even, but square is 2, not 4. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. If Q is p^4, then it's the fourth power, not the square. So statement I would be false, right? Because the square would be p^2, which has (2+1)=3 factors. So if Q is p^4, then it's not the square, but the fourth power.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about specific examples. Let's take p=2. Then p^2 is 4, which has factors 1,2,4. That's 3 factors. So p^2 has 3 factors. p^4 is 16. Factors of 16 are 1,2,4,8,16. That's 5 factors. So yes, Q being p^4 gives 5 factors. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Well, p^4 is (p^2)^2, but it's the fourth power, not the square. So statement I is saying Q is p^2, which would have 3 factors, not 5. So statement I is incorrect.\n\nWait, but wait! I'm getting a bit confused. Let's re-express this. If Q is the square of a prime, like p^2, the number of factors is 3. But the problem states that Q has 5 factors, so statement I can't be true. Therefore, statement I is false.\n\nWait, but the options have statement I as a possibility. So maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the formula is correct. Number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)... So for Q to have 5 factors, the exponents plus one must multiply to 5. Since 5 is prime, the only way is one exponent is 4, others are 0. So Q must be p^4, where p is a prime. So statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime. So that's true.\n\nWait, statement II is correct, but what about statement I? Statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Well, p^4 is not the square; it's the fourth power. So statement I is false. So that would mean that only statement II is correct.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I'm misreading statement I. Let me check. Statement I: Q is the square of a prime number. So if Q is p^4, then it's p squared squared, so it's the square of p squared. So it's the square of a prime squared, but that's not the same as the square of a prime. Hmm, no, because p squared is a different number. So statement I is incorrect. So the correct statement is II.\n\nBut looking at the options, option C is II only, so that would be option C.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again. Are there any other possibilities where Q could have 5 factors without being a fourth power? For example, could it be a product of two primes in some way? Let's see. If Q is the product of two distinct primes, like p*q, then the number of factors is (1+1)(1+1)=4, which is less than 5. So that's not enough. If Q is p^3, then number of factors is (3+1)=4, which is again not 5. So no, the only way is p^4.\n\nSo statement I: Q is the square of a prime. That's p^2, which has 3 factors, so statement I is false. Statement II: Q is the fourth power of a prime. That's correct. Statement III: Q is the product of two primes. That would be p*q, which gives 4 factors, so statement III is false.\n\nSo the correct answer is II only, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA) I only\n\nB) III only\n\nC) II only\n\nD) I and II only\n\nE) I and III only\n\nSo yes, the correct answer is C.\n",

So that implies that Q has a prime factorization with only one prime raised to the 4th power. Because, let's see, (4+1)=5. So Q must be p^4, where p is a prime number.\n\nWait, but wait a second. What if there's another way? Suppose the exponents are such that (a+1)=5 and all other exponents are zero, meaning only one prime factor. So yeah, that makes sense. So Q is the fourth power of a prime. So looking at the statements:\n\nStatement I: Q is the square of a prime number. Well, if Q is p^4, then that's (p^2)^2, so it's a square. So statement I would be true. Because p^4 is indeed (p\u00b2) squared. So statement I is correct.\n\nStatement II: Q is the fourth power of a prime number. Oh yeah, that's exactly what we just said. So statement II is true.\n\nStatement III: Q is the product of two prime numbers. Wait, if Q is p^4, then it's just one prime multiplied four times. So it's not the product of two different primes. So statement III is false. For example, take 16, which is 2^4. It has factors 1, 2, 4, 8, 16. So five factors. But 16 isn't a product of two primes. It's just one prime squared twice.\n\nSo now, let's look at the options. The options are:\n\nA) I only\nB) III only\nC) II only\nD) I and II only\nE) I and III only\n\nWait, according to our analysis, statements I and II are true. So the correct answer would be the option that says both I and II are correct. So looking at the options, option D says I and II only. But wait, wait a minute. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if Q is p^4, then it's the fourth power of a prime, which makes statement II true. And since p^4 is also (p\u00b2) squared, statement I is also true. So both I and II are correct. So option D is correct.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Let me think again. Is statement I correct? Because Q is the square of a prime. Well, p^4 is indeed (p\u00b2)^2, so it's the square of a prime squared. So yes, statement I is correct.\n\nSo statements I and II are both true. So the answer is D.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, I see that option D is \"I and II only.\" So that's the case. So the correct answer should be D.\n\nWait, but wait, another way to think about this: are there other possibilities where a number has exactly five factors? Let's see. Suppose a number has two different primes. Then the number of factors would be (a+1)(b+1). So if (a+1)(b+1)=5, then since 5 is prime, one of them must be 5 and the other 1. So that would mean one exponent is 4 and the other is 0. But a prime exponent can't be zero because that would mean that prime isn't present. So in that case, it's only one prime factor with exponent 4. So no, there's no case where two primes are involved because that would require exponents a and b such that (a+1)(b+1)=5. But 5 is prime, so one of a+1 or b+1 would have to be 5 and the other 1. So a=4, b=0. But b=0 would mean no second prime. So only one prime factor. So Q can't be the product of two primes; that would require two primes each with exponent 1, which would make the number of factors (1+1)(1+1)=4, which is less than 5. So yeah, statement III is false.\n\nSo, back to the statements: I and II are true. So the answer is D.\n",

The question says, \"If Q, a positive integer, has 5 factors, which of the following must be true about Q?\" Then there are three statements: I, II, III. The options are A to E, each combining these statements.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization.

So for example, if Q = p^a * q^b, then the number of factors is (a+1)(b+1).\n\nRight, so in this case, Q has 5 factors. Wait, 5 is a prime number, so the product of (a+1)(b+1) must equal 5. Since 5 is prime, the only way to write it as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5*1. So that means one of the exponents plus one is 5, and the other is 1. Because if there are two primes, like p and q, then (a+1)(b+1) would have to be 5*1, which would mean one exponent is 4 and the other is 0. But wait, if the exponent is 0, that means that prime isn't actually present in the factorization. So, that can't be right.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. If Q has exactly 5 factors, then the number of factors formula must give 5. So, 5 can be expressed as 5*1, but also, could it be 1*5? Either way, it's the same. So that means that the prime factorization must have one exponent plus one equal to 5, and the others equal to 1. But if there are multiple primes, say two primes, then their exponents plus one would multiply to 5. But 5 can't be broken down into more factors unless we go into fractions, which we can't because exponents are integers.\n\nSo the only way is that the number Q is a single prime raised to the 4th power.

I need to determine which of the given statements (I, II, III) must be true about Q. The options are A to E, each combining different statements.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Oh right, if a number is expressed as a product of primes raised to exponents, like Q = p1^a * p2^b * ... , then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)... etc. So for example, if Q is p squared, where p is prime, then the number of factors is (2+1) = 3. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.\n\nWait, if a number is a square of a prime, like p^2, then the exponents are 2, so the number of factors is (2+1) = 3. So that's 3 factors. But in the question, Q has 5 factors. So 5 is a prime number, which would mean that the product of (a+1)(b+1)... has to be 5. Since 5 is prime, the only way is one of the terms is 5 and the rest are 1. So that would mean that the number has a single prime factor raised to the 4th power because (4+1)=5. Wait, wait. Because exponents plus one multiply to 5.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Suppose Q has prime factors p1, p2, etc. Each with exponents a1, a2, etc. So the total number of factors is (a1+1)(a2+1)... Now, since 5 is a prime, the product must be 5. So the only way is to have one term as 5 and the rest as 1. Because if you have more than one term, like (a+1)(b+1)=5, but since 5 is prime, it's 5*1, so one exponent is 4 (since 4+1=5) and the others are 0. Wait, but exponents can't be negative. So the only possibility is that Q is the fourth power of a single prime. So Q = p^4. Then, the number of factors is (4+1)=5. That makes sense.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Wait, if Q is the square of a prime, like p^2, that gives 3 factors: 1, p, p^2. So that's not enough. For 5 factors, it's p^4. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime, which would give 3 factors, which is wrong. So statement I is not necessarily true. Wait, no, wait. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, no, no, no. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. If the number of factors is 5, which is 5 = 5 * 1. So that would imply that the number is of the form p^4, where p is prime. So in that case, Q would be p^4. So that's statement II: Q is the fourth power of a prime. So statement II is correct.\n\nWait, but statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Which would be p^2. Which gives 3 factors. So if Q has 5 factors, statement I is not correct. So statement I is false.\n\nBut wait, what about statement III: Q is the product of two primes. So if Q = p * q, where p and q are primes, then the number of factors is (1+1)(1+1)=4. So that's 4 factors. But we have 5, so that's not possible. So statement III is also false.\n\nWait, but then the options are I only, III only, II only, I and II, etc. So if Q must be p^4, then statement II is true. So the correct answer would be option C: II only.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check if there's any other way to get 5 factors. Could it be that Q is a product of three primes? Like p * q * r, each to the first power. Then the number of factors would be (1+1)^3=8. Which is more than 5. So no, that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, could Q have another form? Like p^2 * q^1. Then the number of factors is (2+1)(1+1)=6. That's more than 5. So no. So the only way is p^4.\n\nSo statement II is correct. Statements I and III are incorrect. So the answer is option C, II only.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Wait, I thought that the number of factors is (e1+1)(e2+1)... So for 5 factors, it's (4+1) or (1+1)(something else that gives 5). But 5 is a prime number, so the only possible way is one exponent being 4, and the rest being zero. Because 5 can't be expressed as a product of smaller integers except 5 and 1. So yes, only one prime factor, and exponent 4.\n\nSo in that case, statement I is wrong because statement I says it's the square of a prime, which would be exponent 2, giving 3 factors. Statement II is correct. Statement III is wrong because product of two primes would give 4 factors.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C: II only.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about a positive integer Q that has exactly 5 factors. I need to determine which of the given statements (I, II, III) must be true about Q. The options are A to E, each combining different statements.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Oh right, if a number is expressed as a product of primes raised to exponents, like Q = p1^a * p2^b * ... , then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)... etc. So for example, if Q is p squared, where p is prime, then the number of factors is (2+1) = 3. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.\n\nWait, if a number is a square of a prime, like p^2, then the exponents are 2, so the number of factors is (2+1) = 3. So that's 3 factors. But in the question, Q has 5 factors. So 5 is a prime number, which would mean that the product of (a+1)(b+1)... has to be 5. Since 5 is prime, the only way is one of the terms is 5 and the rest are 1. So that would mean that the number has a single prime factor raised to the 4th power because (4+1)=5. Wait, wait. Because exponents plus one multiply to 5.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Suppose Q has prime factors p1, p2, etc. Each with exponents a1, a2, etc. So the total number of factors is (a1+1)(a2+1)... Now, since 5 is a prime, the product must be 5. So the only way is to have one term as 5 and the rest as 1. Because if you have more than one term, like (a+1)(b+1)=5, but since 5 is prime, it's 5*1, so one exponent is 4 (since 4+1=5) and the others are 0. Wait, but exponents can't be negative. So the only possibility is that Q is the fourth power of a single prime. So Q = p^4. Then, the number of factors is (4+1)=5. That makes sense.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Wait, if Q is the square of a prime, like p^2, that gives 3 factors: 1, p, p^2. So that's not enough. For 5 factors, it's p^4. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime, which would give 3 factors, which is wrong. So statement I is not necessarily true. Wait, no, wait. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, no, no, no. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. If the number of factors is 5, which is 5 = 5 * 1. So that would imply that the number is of the form p^4, where p is prime. So in that case, Q would be p^4. So that's statement II: Q is the fourth power of a prime. So statement II is correct.\n\nWait, but statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Which would be p^2. Which gives 3 factors. So if Q has 5 factors, statement I is not correct. So statement I is false.\n\nBut wait, what about statement III: Q is the product of two primes. So if Q = p * q, where p and q are primes, then the number of factors is (1+1)(1+1)=4. So that's 4 factors. But we have 5, so that's not possible. So statement III is also false.\n\nWait, but then the options are I only, III only, II only, I and II, etc. So if Q must be p^4, then statement II is true. So the correct answer would be option C: II only.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check if there's any other way to get 5 factors. Could it be that Q is a product of three primes? Like p * q * r, each to the first power. Then the number of factors would be (1+1)^3=8. Which is more than 5. So no, that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, could Q have another form? Like p^2 * q^1. Then the number of factors is (2+1)(1+1)=6. That's more than 5. So no. So the only way is p^4.\n\nSo statement II is correct. Statements I and III are incorrect. So the answer is option C, II only.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Wait, I thought that the number of factors is (e1+1)(e2+1)... So for 5 factors, it's (4+1) or (1+1)(something else that gives 5). But 5 is a prime number, so the only possible way is one exponent being 4, and the rest being zero. Because 5 can't be expressed as a product of smaller integers except 5 and 1. So yes, only one prime factor, and exponent 4.\n\nSo in that case, statement I is wrong because statement I says it's the square of a prime, which would be exponent 2, giving 3 factors. Statement II is correct. Statement III is wrong because product of two primes would give 4 factors.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C: II only.\n\n\nTo determine which statements about \\( Q \\) must be true, we analyze the given condition: \\( Q \\) is a positive integer with exactly 5 factors. The number of factors of a number is determined by its prime factorization. If \\( Q = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\dots p_n^{a_n} \\), the total number of factors is given by \\( (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \\dots (a_n + 1) \\). Since \\( Q \\) has exactly 5 factors, and 5 is a prime number, the only way to express 5 as a product of integers is \\( 5 = 5 \\times 1 \\). This implies that \\( Q \\) must be of the form \\( p^4 \\), where \\( p \\) is a prime number. \n\n### Analysis of the Statements:\n1. **Statement I: \\( Q \\) is the square of a prime number.**  \n   If \\( Q = p^2 \\), the number of factors would be \\( (2 + 1) = 3 \\), which is less than 5.

Thus, this statement is true.\n\n3. **Statement III: \\( Q \\) is the product of two prime numbers.**  \n   If \\( Q = p \\times q \\), where \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are distinct primes, the number of factors is \\( (1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4 \\), which is less than 5.

I think the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Oh right, if a number has a prime factorization of, say, p^a * q^b, then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1). Wait, yeah, that's the formula. So if I have exponents a and b, each plus one multiplied together gives the total factors.\n\nIn this case, Q has 5 factors. So I need to find a number whose number of factors is 5. Let me think about how 5 can be expressed as a product of integers. Well, 5 is a prime number, right? So the only way to express 5 as a product is 5*1. So that means that in the formula (a+1)(b+1), one of the terms must be 5 and the other 1.\n\nSo that would imply that the number Q must be of the form p^4 * q^0, because (4+1)=5 and (0+1)=1.

So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Wait, the square would be p^2. But if Q is p^4, that's the fourth power, not the square. So statement I would be wrong because p^4 is (p^2)^2, but that's not just the square of a prime; it's the square of the square.

So yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but wait, is there any other way for a number to have exactly 5 factors? Because I thought 5 is a prime, so the only way is a single prime raised to the 4th power. So any number with 5 factors must be p^4.\n\nSo then statement II is correct. So the correct answer would be option C, which is II only.\n\nWait, but looking back at the initial options, option C is II only, so that's the correct choice.\n\nSo the answer is option C.\n\n\nTo determine which statements about \\( Q \\) must be true, we analyze the given condition: \\( Q \\) is a positive integer with exactly 5 factors. The number of factors of a number \\( Q \\), expressed in its prime factorization as \\( Q = p_1^{a} p_2^{b} p_3^{c} \\dots \\), is given by \\( (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)\\dots \\). Since \\( Q \\) has exactly 5 factors, and 5 is a prime number, the only way to express 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is \\( 5 = 5 \\times 1 \\). This implies that \\( Q \\) must be the fourth power of a single prime number, i.e., \\( Q = p^4 \\), where \\( p \\) is prime. \n\n### Analysis of the Statements:\n1. **Statement I: \\( Q \\) is the square of a prime number.**  \n   If \\( Q \\) were the square of a prime (\\( p^2 \\)), it would have \\( (2+1) = 3 \\) factors, not 5. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **Statement II: \\( Q \\) is the fourth power of a prime number.**  \n   Since \\( Q \\) must be \\( p^4 \\) to have exactly 5 factors, this statement is true.\n\n3. **Statement III: \\( Q \\) is the product of two prime numbers.**  \n   If \\( Q \\) were the product of two distinct primes (\\( p \\times q \\)), it would have \\( (1+1)(1+1) = 4 \\) factors, not 5. Additionally, \\( Q = p^4 \\) is not a product of two primes but a single prime raised to the fourth power. Thus, this statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nOnly Statement II is true. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: C**",

Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe question is about a positive integer Q that has exactly 5 factors. Then, there are three statements (I, II, III), and I need to determine which must be true about Q. The options are combinations of these statements.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Right, the formula for the number of factors is based on the exponents in the prime factorization. So, if a number Q can be expressed as Q = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pn^an, then the total number of factors is (a1+1)(a2+1)...(an+1). \n\nWait, so if Q has 5 factors, which is a prime number. Since 5 is prime, the only way to express it as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5=5*1. That means that the number of exponents plus one must multiply to 5. So, the exponents can only be arranged such that one of them is 4 and the others are zero, or wait, maybe only one prime factor? Because if you have multiple primes, the product would require each (ai +1) to multiply to 5, but since 5 is prime, only one term can be 5 and the others 1.\n\nSo, for the number of factors to be 5, the prime factorization of Q must be a single prime raised to the 4th power. Because (4 +1) =5. So Q would be p^4, where p is a prime number.\n\nWait, let me think again. If Q is p^4, then the factors are 1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4. That's 5 factors, correct.\n\nSo, looking back at the statements:\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime number. So that would mean Q = p^2. But wait, p squared would have factors (2+1)=3 factors. 1, p, p\u00b2. So that's 3 factors, not 5. So statement I says Q is a square of a prime, but in our case, Q is p^4. So statement I would not be true. Because p^4 is the square of p\u00b2, but that's not the same as being the square of a prime. Oh wait, wait! Wait, p^4 is (p\u00b2)^2, so is that considered the square of a prime? No, because p squared isn't a prime unless p is 2, but even then, p squared is 4, which isn't a prime. So, statement I is incorrect. So Q is not the square of a prime. So I is false.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. If Q is p^4, then can we say it's the square of p squared? So, p squared is another number, let's say p=2, then p squared is 4, which is not prime. So, in that case, statement I would be incorrect. So statement I is false.\n\nII. Q is the fourth power of a prime number. Yes, because Q = p^4. So statement II is true.\n\nIII. Q is the product of two prime numbers. The product of two primes would be p * q, where p and q are primes. The number of factors in that case would be (1+1)(1+1) =4. So, that's 4 factors. But Q has 5 factors, so statement III is false.\n\nSo, looking at the options, the only statement that is true is II.\n\nWait, but the options are:\n\nA) I only\nB) III only\nC) II only\nD) I and II only\nE) I and III only\n\nSo the correct answer must be C, II only.\n\nWait, but wait, I thought earlier that statement I is not true, because Q is p^4, which is (p\u00b2)^2.

I need to figure out which of the statements I, II, III must be true about Q. The options are given as A to E, each combining different statements.\n\nHmm, I remember something about the number of factors a number has. Oh right, the number of factors is related to the exponents in the prime factorization of the number. Like, if a number N can be written as p^a * q^b, where p and q are primes, then the number of factors is (a+1)(b+1). Oh wait, right, because each exponent can range from 0 up to a for p and 0 up to b for q.\n\nSo, Q has 5 factors. Let me think about what that implies. 5 is a prime number, so the only way to express 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 * 1. So, the formula (a+1)(b+1) must equal 5. That means either (a+1)=5 and (b+1)=1, or vice versa. But since exponents can't be negative, the other case would mean one of the exponents is zero, which implies that the number has only one prime factor.\n\nWait, because if (a+1)=5, then a=4, and (b+1)=1 implies b=0. But b=0 would mean that the second prime isn't actually part of the factorization. So Q must be of the form p^4, where p is a prime. Because if there were two primes, the exponents would have to be such that (a+1)(b+1) equals 5, but that's not possible unless one exponent is 4 and the other is 0.\n\nSo, Q is the fourth power of a prime number. That would make statement II correct. But wait, statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Hmm. If Q is p^4, then it's (p^2)^2, so it's also a square of a prime squared. Wait, no, p is a prime, so p^2 is a square of a prime. So Q would be the square of p squared, but that's not the same as being the square of a prime. Wait, no, p^4 is (p^2)^2, but p is a prime. So p^2 is a square of a prime, but p^4 is the square of p squared. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime, which would be p^2. But if Q is p^4, then it's not the square of a prime, unless p^4 is considered as (p^2)^2, but p^2 is itself a square of a prime. Wait, no, p is prime, so p^2 is a square, but Q is p^4, which is the square of p^2, which is a square of a square. Hmm, but does that make Q the square of a prime? No, because p^2 is not a prime; it's a composite number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think again. If Q is p^4, then its prime factors are only p, and the exponents add up in a way that gives 5 factors. So in terms of the number of factors, yes, it's p^4. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Well, p^4 is (p^2)^2. So p^2 is a square of a prime. So Q is the square of p^2, but p^2 is a composite number, not a prime. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So if p is a prime, then p^2 is a square of a prime, but Q is p^4, which is (p^2)^2. So Q is the square of a composite number, not a prime. So statement I would be false in this case.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me clarify. Statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So if Q is p^4, then that's (p^2)^2, but p^2 is a square of a prime. But does that mean Q is the square of a prime? No, because p^2 is not a prime. So statement I would be incorrect. So then, statement II is correct because Q is the fourth power of a prime. Statement III says Q is the product of two primes. Well, if Q is p^4, then it's p multiplied four times, which is a single prime raised to a power, not a product of two different primes. So statement III is incorrect.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. What if there are two primes, like p and q, and Q is p^1 * q^3. Then the number of factors would be (1+1)(3+1) = 2*4=8 factors, which is more than 5. So that doesn't fit. So the only way to get exactly 5 factors is for Q to be the fourth power of a single prime. Because 5 is a prime, so the exponents must be 4 and 0, but 0 implies the other primes aren't present. So the only possible form is p^4.\n\nSo, looking back at the statements:\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime. No, because Q is p^4, which is the square of p^2 (a composite). So I is false.\n\nII. Q is the fourth power of a prime. Yes, that's correct. So II is true.\n\nIII. Q is the product of two primes. No, because Q is a single prime raised to the fourth power, not two different primes multiplied. So III is false.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, the options are A to E. Let me look again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA) I only\n\nB) III only\n\nC) II only\n\nD) I and II only\n\nE) I and III only\n\nWait, but according to this, only II is correct. So the correct option is C) II only.\n\nBut wait, I'm confused again. Let me think again. Because the initial formula was (a+1)(b+1)=5. Since 5 is prime, the only way is 5=5*1. So either a+1=5 and b+1=1, or vice versa. But since exponents can't be negative, b+1=1 implies b=0, which means that the other prime isn't present. So the number must be of the form p^4, where p is a prime. So statement II is correct.\n\nSo statement I: Q is the square of a prime. Well, p^4 is (p^2)^2, which is the square of p squared. So is p squared a prime? No. So Q is the square of a composite. So I is incorrect.\n\nStatement III: product of two primes. If it's p^4, then it's a single prime, so III is incorrect.\n\nWait, but wait another scenario. What if the number is p^4, and another prime? No, because that would add more factors. For example, if Q is p^4 * q^0, which is just p^4. So no, only p^4.\n\nSo the correct statements are only II. So the answer should be C) II only.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option C is II only, yes.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me think about whether Q could be the square of a prime. Suppose Q is p^2. Then the number of factors would be 2+1=3. So that's 3 factors. But the question says Q has 5 factors, so p^2 would have 3, not 5. So Q can't be p^2; it must be p^4.\n\nSo statement I is wrong. So only statement II is correct.\n",

So the correct option is C) II only.\n\nBut wait, I'm confused again. Let me think again. Because the initial formula was (a+1)(b+1)=5. Since 5 is prime, the only way is 5=5*1. So either a+1=5 and b+1=1, or vice versa. But since exponents can't be negative, b+1=1 implies b=0, which means that the other prime isn't present. So the number must be of the form p^4, where p is a prime. So statement II is correct.\n\nSo statement I: Q is the square of a prime. Well, p^4 is (p^2)^2, which is the square of p squared. So is p squared a prime? No. So Q is the square of a composite. So I is incorrect.\n\nStatement III: product of two primes. If it's p^4, then it's a single prime, so III is incorrect.\n\nWait, but wait another scenario. What if the number is p^4, and another prime? No, because that would add more factors. For example, if Q is p^4 * q^0, which is just p^4. So no, only p^4.\n\nSo the correct statements are only II. So the answer should be C) II only.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option C is II only, yes.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me think about whether Q could be the square of a prime. Suppose Q is p^2. Then the number of factors would be 2+1=3. So that's 3 factors. But the question says Q has 5 factors, so p^2 would have 3, not 5. So Q can't be p^2; it must be p^4.\n\nSo statement I is wrong. So only statement II is correct.\n\n\nTo determine which statements about \\( Q \\) must be true, we analyze the number of factors \\( Q \\) has. The number of factors of a positive integer is determined by its prime factorization. If \\( Q \\) can be expressed as \\( p^a \\cdot q^b \\), where \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are prime numbers, the total number of factors is given by \\( (a+1)(b+1) \\). Since \\( Q \\) has exactly 5 factors, and 5 is a prime number, the only way to express 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is \\( 5 \\times 1 \\). This implies that \\( (a+1) = 5 \\) and \\( (b+1) = 1 \\), or vice versa. \n\nFrom \\( (a+1) = 5 \\), we find \\( a = 4 \\), and from \\( (b+1) = 1 \\), we find \\( b = 0 \\). This means \\( Q \\) must be of the form \\( p^4 \\), where \\( p \\) is a prime number. The presence of \\( b = 0 \\) indicates that \\( Q \\) has only one prime factor, \\( p \\), and no other prime factors.\n\nNow, we evaluate the statements:\n\n1. **Statement I: \\( Q \\) is the square of a prime number.**  \n   If \\( Q = p^4 \\), it can be written as \\( (p^2)^2 \\). However, \\( p^2 \\) is not a prime number; it is a composite number. Therefore, \\( Q \\) is not the square of a prime number. **Statement I is false.**\n\n2. **Statement II: \\( Q \\) is the fourth power of a prime number.**  \n   Since \\( Q = p^4 \\), where \\( p \\) is a prime number, this statement is true. **Statement II is true.**\n\n3. **Statement III: \\( Q \\) is the product of two prime numbers.**  \n   If \\( Q = p^4 \\), it is a single prime number raised to the fourth power, not a product of two distinct prime numbers. **Statement III is false.**\n\nThus, only Statement II is true. The correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: C**",

The options are given as A to E, each combining different statements.\n\nHmm, I remember something about the number of factors a number has. Oh right, the number of factors relates to the exponents in the prime factorization of the number. The formula is that if a number N has a prime factorization of the form N = p1^a * p2^b * ... * pn^k, then the number of factors is (a+1)*(b+1)*...*(k+1). So each exponent is increased by one and multiplied together.\n\nIn this case, Q has 5 factors. Since 5 is a prime number, the only way to write it as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 itself. So the formula (a+1)*(b+1)... must equal 5. That can only happen if there's just one term in the product, meaning Q is of the form p^4, where p is a prime number. Because if a=4, then a+1=5, which gives exactly 5 factors.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If Q is p^4, then the factors are 1, p, p\u00b2, p\u00b3, p\u2074. That's five factors. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Wait, square is p\u00b2, which would have 3 factors: 1, p, p\u00b2. So that's not 5 factors. Oh, I must have mixed that up. So statement I is wrong because the square of a prime has 3 factors, not 5. So statement I is false.\n\nWhat about statement II: Q is the fourth power of a prime. Oh right, as I just worked out, that's correct. So statement II must be true.\n\nStatement III says Q is the product of two primes. If Q is the product of two distinct primes, like p*q, then the number of factors is (1+1)(1+1) =4. So that's four factors, not five. But if it's the same prime squared, like p\u00b2, that's three factors, as before. So statement III can't be correct because Q must be the fourth power of a single prime, not a product of two primes. So statement III is false.\n\nSo looking at the options, only statement II is true. Let's check the options:\n\nOption A: I only. No, because I is false.\nOption B: III only. No, III is false.\nOption C: II only. Yes, that's correct.\nOption D: I and II only. No, because I is false.\nOption E: I and III only. Also no.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C.\n",

Since 5 is a prime number, the only way to write it as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5*1. So the exponents plus one must multiply to 5.

So p^2 is a square of a prime, but p^4 is the square of p^2, which is a square of a composite number. So is p^4 the square of a prime? No, because p^4 is (p^2)^2, and p^2 is composite unless p=2, but even then p^2 is 4, which is composite. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So if Q is p^4, then Q is (p^2)^2.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. If Q is p^4, then Q is the square of p^2. So p^2 is a square of a prime. So is p^4 the square of a prime? No, because p^4 is (p^2)^2, but p^2 is not a prime. So statement I is not necessarily true. So statement I is saying Q is the square of a prime.

The number of factors is (e1 +1)(e2 +1)... So since 5 is prime, the only way is to have one exponent plus one equal to 5, and others be zero? No, because exponents are at least 1 if a prime is present. Wait, no. Let's clarify. The number of factors formula applies to the prime factorization. So if Q has only one prime factor, then its exponent plus one is 5, so exponent is 4. So Q is p^4. So that's the only case where the number of factors is 5.

I need to determine which of the statements I, II, or III must be true about Q. The options are given, and I have to pick the correct one.\n\nHmm, I remember something about the number of factors a number has. I think it's related to the exponents in its prime factorization. Oh right, if a number has a prime factorization like p^a * q^b, then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... for each prime. So for example, if a number is p^2, then it has (2+1) = 3 factors: 1, p, and p\u00b2.\n\nWait, the question says Q has 5 factors. So 5 is the total number. Since 5 is a prime number, the only way to write it as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 \u00d7 1. So that would mean that the exponents in the prime factorization of Q must satisfy (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... =5. So the only possibility is that one of the exponents is 4 (because 4+1=5) and all others are 0, meaning no other primes are present. Because if you have more than one prime factor, the product would be more than 1 in each (a+1) term, which would make the total number of factors more than 5.\n\nSo that means Q must be of the form p^4, where p is a prime. Because if you have p^4, the number of factors is (4+1) =5. So that's the case.\n\nNow, let's look at the statements:\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime number. So p\u00b2. But wait, if Q is p^4, then it's p squared squared. So that's not the square of a prime, unless p is a prime. Wait, wait, no. Because p is a prime. So p^4 is (p\u00b2)^2. So Q is the square of (p squared), which is a composite number, but Q is the square of a prime squared. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. So, is p^4 equal to (p\u00b2)^2? Yes. So, is Q the square of a prime? No, because (p\u00b2) is not a prime, it's a square of a prime. So statement I would be true only if Q is p\u00b2, which would have 3 factors. But in our case, Q is p^4, which has 5 factors. So statement I is not necessarily true. Wait, but wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So if Q is p\u00b2, then yes, but in our case, Q is p^4. So statement I is false because Q isn't p\u00b2, but p^4. So statement I is not true.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up. Let me think again. If Q is p^4, then it's (p\u00b2)^2. So it's the square of p\u00b2, which is a composite number. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So that would be false because p\u00b2 is not a prime. So statement I is false.\n\nWait, but another thought: If p is a prime, then p^2 is a square of a prime, right? So Q is p^4, which is (p\u00b2)^2. So that would make Q the square of p\u00b2, which is a composite number. So statement I is saying Q is the square of a prime, which would require p^4 = (q)^2 where q is a prime. That would imply that q must be p squared, but p squared is not a prime, unless p is 2, but then q would be 4, which isn't a prime. So no, statement I is false.\n\nSo statement I is not true. So that means option A (which says I only) is incorrect. Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me think about the number of factors. Q has 5 factors. So, as I said, it must be of the form p^4, because 5 is a prime, so the exponents plus one multiply to 5, which only allows one exponent of 4, and all others zero. So Q is p^4.\n\nNow, statement I: Q is the square of a prime. So p^4 is (p^2)^2. So that's the square of p squared. But p squared is not a prime. So statement I is not correct. So statement I is false.\n\nStatement II: Q is the fourth power of a prime. Yes, because Q is p^4, which is the fourth power of a prime. So statement II is true.\n\nStatement III: Q is the product of two prime numbers. Wait, the product of two primes would be like p*q. The number of factors for p*q is (1+1)(1+1) =4, which would be four factors. But our Q has five factors, so statement III is false.\n\nSo which statements are true? Only statement II is true. So the options are looking at the choices. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA) I only \u2192 false because only II is true.\n\nB) III only \u2192 false.\n\nC) II only \u2192 yes, that's correct.\n\nD) I and II only \u2192 II is true, I is false, so D is incorrect.\n\nE) I and III only \u2192 both are false.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C, II only.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this math problem. Let me read it again. The question is about a positive integer Q that has 5 factors. I need to determine which of the statements I, II, or III must be true about Q. The options are given, and I have to pick the correct one.\n\nHmm, I remember something about the number of factors a number has. I think it's related to the exponents in its prime factorization. Oh right, if a number has a prime factorization like p^a * q^b, then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... for each prime. So for example, if a number is p^2, then it has (2+1) = 3 factors: 1, p, and p\u00b2.\n\nWait, the question says Q has 5 factors. So 5 is the total number. Since 5 is a prime number, the only way to write it as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 \u00d7 1. So that would mean that the exponents in the prime factorization of Q must satisfy (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... =5. So the only possibility is that one of the exponents is 4 (because 4+1=5) and all others are 0, meaning no other primes are present. Because if you have more than one prime factor, the product would be more than 1 in each (a+1) term, which would make the total number of factors more than 5.\n\nSo that means Q must be of the form p^4, where p is a prime. Because if you have p^4, the number of factors is (4+1) =5. So that's the case.\n\nNow, let's look at the statements:\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime number. So p\u00b2. But wait, if Q is p^4, then it's p squared squared. So that's not the square of a prime, unless p is a prime. Wait, wait, no. Because p is a prime. So p^4 is (p\u00b2)^2. So Q is the square of (p squared), which is a composite number, but Q is the square of a prime squared. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. So, is p^4 equal to (p\u00b2)^2? Yes. So, is Q the square of a prime? No, because (p\u00b2) is not a prime, it's a square of a prime. So statement I would be true only if Q is p\u00b2, which would have 3 factors. But in our case, Q is p^4, which has 5 factors. So statement I is not necessarily true. Wait, but wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, statement I says Q is the square of a prime.

So that would be false because p\u00b2 is not a prime. So statement I is false.\n\nWait, but another thought: If p is a prime, then p^2 is a square of a prime, right?

Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. The formula for the number of factors is to take the exponents in the prime factorization, add one to each, and then multiply them together. So if a number N has a prime factorization of N = p1^a * p2^b * p3^c..., then the number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc.\n\nIn this problem, Q has 5 factors. Hmm, 5 is a prime number. So the product of (exponents +1) must equal 5. Since 5 is prime, the only way to get it is 5*1. So that means the number of exponents plus one in the prime factorization must be 5 and the rest 1. Wait, no, actually, 5 can be written as 5*1, which suggests that the exponents plus one are 4 and 0? Wait, no, because exponents can't be negative. So maybe the only way is that there's only one prime factor, and its exponent is 4. Because (4+1) =5. So that would mean Q is p^4, where p is a prime.\n\nAlternatively, could there be more than one prime factor? Let's think. Suppose there are two primes, then (a+1)(b+1)=5. Since 5 is prime, the only way is one of them is 5 and the other is 1. So one exponent is 4, the other is 0. But wait, exponents can't be zero because that would mean that prime isn't present. So that would mean that there's only one prime factor, right? Because if you have two primes, one would have exponent 4, and the other exponent 0. But exponent 0 would mean that prime isn't in the factorization. So actually, that case isn't possible because the other prime isn't present. So the only possibility is that Q is a single prime raised to the 4th power.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. What if it's a square of a prime? Then the number of factors would be (2+1)=3, which is not 5. So that's not possible. So if Q is p^4, then it has 5 factors. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. But p squared would be p^2, which has 3 factors, not 5. So statement I is incorrect. Wait, wait, no\u2014no, statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So if Q is p^2, number of factors is 3. But in our case, number of factors is 5, so Q can't be p squared. So statement I is false.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that Q is p^4, which would make statement II correct. Because statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime. So that would be correct.\n\nStatement III says Q is the product of two primes. Let me think. If Q is the product of two primes, say p*q, then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1)=4. Because exponents are 1 each. So that gives 4 factors, which is less than 5. So statement III is incorrect. So only statement II is correct.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Are there any other possibilities? Because sometimes when I think about exponents, I might have missed something. Let's see. The number of factors is 5, which is prime, so the only way is (4+1)=5. So the prime factorization can only have one prime with exponent 4. So Q must be a prime raised to the fourth power. So I think statement II is correct, and the others are not.\n\nSo looking at the options:\n\nI. Q is square of prime. No, because that gives 3 factors.\n\nII. Q is fourth power of prime. Yes.\n\nIII.

I need to determine which of the statements I, II, or III must be true about Q. The options are A to E, each combining these statements.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Like, if a number has a prime factorization of the form p^a * q^b, then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1), right? Oh wait, yeah, that's the formula. So for example, if a number is p squared, then it has (2+1)=3 factors: 1, p, p\u00b2.\n\nSo in this case, Q has 5 factors. 5 is a prime number, so the only way to write 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5=5*1. So that means that in the prime factorization of Q, there must be only one term with exponent 4 because (4+1)=5. Oh wait, right, because (4+1) is 5, so the number of factors is 5. So that would mean Q is p^4, where p is a prime number. \n\nWait, but wait another thought. Let me think again. If Q is p^4, then the factors are 1, p, p\u00b2, p\u00b3, p\u2074. That's five factors. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Wait, the square would be p\u00b2, which has 3 factors. So statement I is saying Q is p\u00b2, but if Q is p^4, then statement I isn't true. Hmm, so maybe I was wrong earlier.\n\nWait no, wait. Let me re-express. The number of factors is 5, which is a prime. So the number must be of the form p^(5-1) = p^4, because the formula for the number of factors is (exponent + 1) for each prime factor. So if the total is 5, which is prime, the exponents must all be 4, and there's only one prime factor. So Q is the fourth power of a prime.\n\nSo statement I says Q is the square of a prime. That would be p\u00b2, which has 3 factors, not 5. So statement I is not correct. Statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime, which would mean Q = p^4, which has 5 factors. So statement II is correct. Statement III says Q is the product of two primes, which would be p*q, where p and q are primes. The number of factors in that case would be (1+1)(1+1) = 4, so 4 factors, not 5. So statement III is incorrect.\n\nWait, but wait, another thought: could there be any other form? Like, what if Q is p^4 * q^0, meaning it's just a single prime raised to the fourth power. Yeah, that's the only way to get 5 factors, since any more primes would require multiplying exponents, leading to more factors.\n\nSo, looking back at the options. Statement I is wrong because it's the square, not the fourth power. Statement II is correct. Statement III is wrong because the product of two primes would give 4 factors. So only statement II is correct.\n\nLooking at the options, option C says II only. So the answer should be C. Let me check the options again. Option C is II only. So the correct answer is C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem in front of me. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question is about a positive integer Q that has exactly 5 factors. I need to determine which of the statements I, II, or III must be true about Q. The options are A to E, each combining these statements.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Like, if a number has a prime factorization of the form p^a * q^b, then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1), right? Oh wait, yeah, that's the formula. So for example, if a number is p squared, then it has (2+1)=3 factors: 1, p, p\u00b2.\n\nSo in this case, Q has 5 factors. 5 is a prime number, so the only way to write 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5=5*1. So that means that in the prime factorization of Q, there must be only one term with exponent 4 because (4+1)=5. Oh wait, right, because (4+1) is 5, so the number of factors is 5. So that would mean Q is p^4, where p is a prime number. \n\nWait, but wait another thought. Let me think again. If Q is p^4, then the factors are 1, p, p\u00b2, p\u00b3, p\u2074. That's five factors. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Wait, the square would be p\u00b2, which has 3 factors. So statement I is saying Q is p\u00b2, but if Q is p^4, then statement I isn't true. Hmm, so maybe I was wrong earlier.\n\nWait no, wait. Let me re-express. The number of factors is 5, which is a prime. So the number must be of the form p^(5-1) = p^4, because the formula for the number of factors is (exponent + 1) for each prime factor. So if the total is 5, which is prime, the exponents must all be 4, and there's only one prime factor. So Q is the fourth power of a prime.\n\nSo statement I says Q is the square of a prime. That would be p\u00b2, which has 3 factors, not 5. So statement I is not correct. Statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime, which would mean Q = p^4, which has 5 factors. So statement II is correct. Statement III says Q is the product of two primes, which would be p*q, where p and q are primes. The number of factors in that case would be (1+1)(1+1) = 4, so 4 factors, not 5. So statement III is incorrect.\n\nWait, but wait, another thought: could there be any other form? Like, what if Q is p^4 * q^0, meaning it's just a single prime raised to the fourth power. Yeah, that's the only way to get 5 factors, since any more primes would require multiplying exponents, leading to more factors.\n\nSo, looking back at the options. Statement I is wrong because it's the square, not the fourth power. Statement II is correct. Statement III is wrong because the product of two primes would give 4 factors. So only statement II is correct.\n\nLooking at the options, option C says II only. So the answer should be C. Let me check the options again. Option C is II only. So the correct answer is C.\n\n\nTo determine which statements about \\( Q \\) must be true, we analyze the number of factors \\( Q \\) has. The number of factors of a positive integer is determined by its prime factorization. If \\( Q \\) has exactly 5 factors, we use the formula for the number of factors: if \\( Q = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\dots p_n^{a_n} \\), then the number of factors is \\( (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \\dots (a_n + 1) \\). \n\nSince 5 is a prime number, the only way to write 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is \\( 5 = 5 \\times 1 \\). This means \\( Q \\) must have a prime factorization of the form \\( p^4 \\), where \\( p \\) is a prime number. This ensures that \\( Q \\) has exactly \\( 4 + 1 = 5 \\) factors.\n\nNow, we evaluate the statements:\n\n1. **Statement I**: \\( Q \\) is the square of a prime number.  \n   If \\( Q \\) were \\( p^2 \\), it would have \\( 2 + 1 = 3 \\) factors, not 5. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **Statement II**: \\( Q \\) is the fourth power of a prime number.  \n   If \\( Q = p^4 \\), it has \\( 4 + 1 = 5 \\) factors, which matches the given condition. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n3. **Statement III**: \\( Q \\) is the product of two prime numbers.  \n   If \\( Q \\) were \\( p \\times q \\), where \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are distinct primes, it would have \\( (1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4 \\) factors, not 5. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nFrom this analysis, only Statement II is correct. Thus, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: C**",

Let me read it again.\n\nThe question is about a positive integer Q that has exactly 5 factors. Then there are three statements, I, II, III, and I have to determine which of them must be true about Q.\n\nThe options are A to E, each combining these statements. So my task is to figure out which statements are necessarily true when Q has 5 factors.\n\nHmm. I remember that the number of factors a number has relates to its prime factorization. Let me think about that. Oh right, if a number is expressed as a product of primes, like Q = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... pn^an, then the total number of factors is (a1+1)*(a2+1)*...*(an+1).\n\nSo for Q to have exactly 5 factors, the product of (exponents +1) should be 5. Wait, 5 is a prime number, so the only way to write it as a product is 5 * 1. That means the exponents plus one must multiply to 5, so the exponents themselves are such that each is one less.\n\nSo the exponents in the prime factorization can only be 4, because 4+1=5. Or wait, could there be more than one prime? Because if there were two primes, each with exponents, then (a+1)(b+1)=5. But 5 is prime, so one of them would have to be 5 and the other 1. But 1 as (a+1) would mean a=0, which isn't allowed because that prime wouldn't be present. So that's not possible. So the only way is a single prime raised to the 4th power, right?\n\nWait, no. Wait, 5 is the product of (a+1). So if Q is p^4, then the number of factors is 4+1=5. That's one possibility.\n\nAlternatively, could it be the square of a prime? Because the square of a prime has (2+1)=3 factors. Wait, 3 is not 5. So that's not it.\n\nWait, what if there are two primes, each with exponents such that (a+1)(b+1)=5. But since 5 is prime, the only way is 5*1. So one exponent is 4, the other is 0. But that would mean only one prime is present because the other would have exponent 0 (i.e., it's not present). So that brings us back to the same case as before: a single prime raised to the 4th power.\n\nSo the only way is that Q is p^4, where p is prime.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. I think I might be mixing up. Let me think again. Because 5 is a prime number, the exponents plus 1 can only be 5 and 1. So for Q, the prime factorization must be a single prime raised to the 4th power. Because if there were two primes, their exponents plus 1 would have to multiply to 5, but since 5 can't be factored into two numbers greater than 1, except 5 and 1, but 1 would imply an exponent of 0, meaning the prime isn't actually a factor. So yeah, only one prime.\n\nSo that would mean that Q is the fourth power of a prime. So statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime. So II is true.\n\nWait, but what about statement I? Statement I says Q is the square of a prime. But if Q is p^4, that's (p^2)^2, which is the square of a square of a prime. But a square of a prime is p^2, which has 3 factors. So if Q is p^4, then it's not the square of a prime; it's the fourth power. So statement I is false.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no. Let's clarify. Statement I: Q is the square of a prime. So if Q is p^4, can that be written as (p^2)^2, which is the square of a prime squared. So Q is the square of p^2. But p^2 is not a prime; it's a composite. So the square of a prime is p^2, but Q is p^4, which is (p^2)^2, so the square of a composite number. Therefore, statement I is not true because Q is the fourth power, not the square of a prime.\n\nSo statement I is false. So statement II is true, statement I is false.\n\nWhat about statement III: Q is the product of two primes. So the product of two primes would be p*q. The number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1)=4. But Q has 5 factors, which is more than 4. So statement III is false. Because if Q is the product of two distinct primes, it has 4 factors, which is less than 5. So statement III is false.\n\nSo now, looking at the options:\n\nI. False\nII. True\nIII. False\n\nSo which options match this?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) I only \u2192 False\nB) III only \u2192 False\nC) II only \u2192 True\nD) I and II only \u2192 I is false, so D is wrong\nE) I and III only \u2192 Both are false, so E is wrong\n\nSo the correct option is C) II only.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake earlier? Because another way to think about it: the number of factors is 5, which is prime. So the formula for the number of factors is (exponents + 1) multiplied. So only possible when one exponent is 4, others are zero. So Q must be p^4, so statement II is true. So the correct statements are only II. So the answer is option C.\n",

So for example, if a number is p squared, then the number of factors is (2+1)=3.\n\nWait, the problem says Q has 5 factors. So I need to find the possible forms of Q that would result in exactly 5 factors. Let me think about 5. 5 is a prime number, so the only way to write it as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5*1. So that would mean that in the prime factorization of Q, there's only one exponent plus one equals 5, and the rest are 1. So the exponents would be 4 for that prime, and other primes would have exponent 0, meaning they don't exist.\n\nWait, so that would imply that Q must be the fourth power of a prime number. Because if Q is p^4, then the number of factors is 4+1=5. So statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime. So II would be true.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check. Another possibility is if there are more than one primes involved. Let's see, 5 can also be written as 5*1, but if we have two primes, say p and q, then the exponents would have to satisfy (a+1)(b+1)=5. Since 5 is prime, the only way is a=4 and b=0, or a=0 and b=4. So that would mean Q is p^4 * q^0, which is just p^4, or q^4. So regardless, it's the fourth power of a single prime. So II is correct.\n\nBut wait, what about statement I: Q is the square of a prime. Let's see. If Q is p squared, then the number of factors is 3 (1, p, p\u00b2). So that gives 3 factors, not 5. So statement I can't be correct, right? Because p squared would give 3 factors, not 5. So I must be false.\n\nWait, wait a second. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. So, the number of factors is given by multiplying (exponent + 1) for each prime. So to get 5 factors, which is prime, the only way is to have a single exponent plus one equal to 5. So the exponent is 4, so Q is p^4.\n\nSo statement II is correct, but statement I is incorrect because p squared would give 3 factors, not 5. So statement I is false.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, the options include I and II only as option D. Wait, but I thought I was false. So maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me go through it again. If Q is the square of a prime, it's p\u00b2, which has 3 factors. So I is false because the question says Q has 5 factors. So statement I is false.\n\nThen statement II is correct because Q is p^4, which gives 5 factors. So II is true.\n\nWhat about statement III: Q is the product of two primes. So if Q is p * q, where p and q are primes, then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1) = 4. So that gives 4 factors, not 5. So statement III is false. So III can't be correct.\n\nWait, so that leaves only statement II as true.

But wait, let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are:\nA) I only\nB) III only\nC) II only\nD) I and II only\nE) I and III only\n\nSo according to my reasoning, only statement II is correct. So the answer should be option C.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Wait, could Q be a product of two primes in a different way? Like if one of the exponents is higher. Wait, no, because if you have two primes, p and q, and exponents a and b, then (a+1)(b+1)=5. Since 5 is prime, either a=4 and b=0, or a=0 and b=4. So that would make Q=p^4 * q^0 = p^4, which is just a single prime raised to the 4th power. So that's the same as statement II. So if Q is a product of two primes, but one of them is raised to the 4th power, and the other is to the 0 power (so not present), then it's still the fourth power of a single prime. So that doesn't make it a product of two primes. So statement III is incorrect.\n\nWait, unless I'm misunderstanding statement III. Statement III says Q is the product of two primes, like p * q, without any exponents. Then the number of factors is (1+1)(1+1)=4, which is not 5. So statement III is definitely false.\n\nSo to recap: Q must be p^4, so statement II is correct, I and III are incorrect. So the correct answer is option C, II only.\n",

Let's see, 5 can also be written as 5*1, but if we have two primes, say p and q, then the exponents would have to satisfy (a+1)(b+1)=5. Since 5 is prime, the only way is a=4 and b=0, or a=0 and b=4. So that would mean Q is p^4 * q^0, which is just p^4, or q^4. So regardless, it's the fourth power of a single prime. So II is correct.\n\nBut wait, what about statement I: Q is the square of a prime. Let's see. If Q is p squared, then the number of factors is 3 (1, p, p\u00b2). So that gives 3 factors, not 5. So statement I can't be correct, right? Because p squared would give 3 factors, not 5. So I must be false.\n\nWait, wait a second. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. So, the number of factors is given by multiplying (exponent + 1) for each prime. So to get 5 factors, which is prime, the only way is to have a single exponent plus one equal to 5. So the exponent is 4, so Q is p^4.\n\nSo statement II is correct, but statement I is incorrect because p squared would give 3 factors, not 5. So statement I is false.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, the options include I and II only as option D. Wait, but I thought I was false. So maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me go through it again. If Q is the square of a prime, it's p\u00b2, which has 3 factors. So I is false because the question says Q has 5 factors. So statement I is false.\n\nThen statement II is correct because Q is p^4, which gives 5 factors. So II is true.\n\nWhat about statement III: Q is the product of two primes. So if Q is p * q, where p and q are primes, then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1) = 4. So that gives 4 factors, not 5. So statement III is false. So III can't be correct.\n\nWait, so that leaves only statement II as true. So looking at the options, option C is II only, which would be the answer. But wait, let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are:\nA) I only\nB) III only\nC) II only\nD) I and II only\nE) I and III only\n\nSo according to my reasoning, only statement II is correct. So the answer should be option C.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Wait, could Q be a product of two primes in a different way? Like if one of the exponents is higher. Wait, no, because if you have two primes, p and q, and exponents a and b, then (a+1)(b+1)=5. Since 5 is prime, either a=4 and b=0, or a=0 and b=4. So that would make Q=p^4 * q^0 = p^4, which is just a single prime raised to the 4th power. So that's the same as statement II. So if Q is a product of two primes, but one of them is raised to the 4th power, and the other is to the 0 power (so not present), then it's still the fourth power of a single prime. So that doesn't make it a product of two primes. So statement III is incorrect.\n\nWait, unless I'm misunderstanding statement III. Statement III says Q is the product of two primes, like p * q, without any exponents. Then the number of factors is (1+1)(1+1)=4, which is not 5. So statement III is definitely false.\n\nSo to recap: Q must be p^4, so statement II is correct, I and III are incorrect. So the correct answer is option C, II only.\n\n\nTo determine which statements about \\( Q \\) must be true, we analyze the number of factors \\( Q \\) has. The number of factors of a positive integer is determined by its prime factorization. If \\( Q \\) has a prime factorization of the form \\( p_1^{a} \\cdot p_2^{b} \\cdot \\ldots \\), the total number of factors is given by \\( (a+1)(b+1)\\ldots \\). Since \\( Q \\) has exactly 5 factors, and 5 is a prime number, the only way to express 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is \\( 5 \\times 1 \\). This implies that \\( Q \\) must be of the form \\( p^4 \\), where \\( p \\) is a prime number.\n\n### Analysis of the Statements:\n1. **Statement I: \\( Q \\) is the square of a prime number.**  \n   If \\( Q \\) were the square of a prime number, it would have the form \\( p^2 \\). The number of factors of \\( p^2 \\) is \\( 2+1 = 3 \\), which is not 5. Therefore, statement I is false.\n\n2. **Statement II: \\( Q \\) is the fourth power of a prime number.**  \n   If \\( Q \\) is the fourth power of a prime number, it would have the form \\( p^4 \\). The number of factors of \\( p^4 \\) is \\( 4+1 = 5 \\), which matches the given condition. Therefore, statement II is true.\n\n3. **Statement III: \\( Q \\) is the product of two prime numbers.**  \n   If \\( Q \\) were the product of two prime numbers, it would have the form \\( p \\cdot q \\), where \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are distinct primes. The number of factors of \\( p \\cdot q \\) is \\( (1+1)(1+1) = 4 \\), which is not 5. Therefore, statement III is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nOnly statement II is true.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is about a positive integer Q that has exactly 5 factors. I need to determine which of the statements I, II, or III must be true about Q. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.\n\nHmm, right, factors. I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Oh wait, yes! The formula for the number of factors is based on the exponents in the prime factorization. Like, if a number N can be expressed as N = p1^a * p2^b * p3^c..., then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... and so on for each prime.\n\nSo, since Q has 5 factors, I need to think about how 5 can be expressed as a product of integers greater than 1, because each (exponent +1) term contributes to the total number of factors. \n\nWait, 5 is a prime number. So the only way to express 5 as a product is 5 * 1. That means that the exponents plus one must multiply to 5. So, the exponents would be 4 and 0 for other primes, but wait, exponents can't be negative. So, probably, the prime factorization of Q is such that it has only one prime factor with an exponent of 4, because (4+1)=5. Or maybe two primes, but no, wait, 5 is prime, so maybe only one term.\n\nWait, let me think again. If Q has a prime factorization with two primes, then the number of factors would be (a+1)(b+1). So, for this product to be 5, 5 can only be written as 5*1. So, that would mean one of the exponents is 4 and the other is 0. But wait, exponents can't be zero because that would mean that prime isn't actually a factor. So that's not possible. So, the only possibility is that Q is the power of a single prime number. Because if it's the product of two different primes, then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1)=4, which is less than 5. So that's not the case.\n\nSo, for the number of factors to be 5, Q must be of the form p^4, where p is a prime. Because (4+1)=5 factors. Alternatively, could it be p^2*q^0? Well, yeah, but that's the same as p^4.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Let's say Q is p^4, then the factors would be 1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4. That's 5 factors. Alternatively, if Q is p^2, then the number of factors would be (2+1)=3, which is less than 5. So, that's not it. So, the exponent must be 4.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify. The formula is that for each prime, you take the exponent, add 1, and multiply them all together. So for Q to have 5 factors, 5 must be the product of these (exponent+1) terms. Since 5 is prime, the only way is to have one term of 5 and the rest 1s. So, that would mean that there's exactly one prime factor, and its exponent is 4.\n\nSo, Q must be p^4 where p is prime. Now, looking at the options:\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime number. Wait, p^4 is (p^2)^2, so that's the square of p squared. Alternatively, the square of a prime would be p^2, which has 3 factors. So I is saying Q is p^2. But our case is Q is p^4, which is different. So statement I is not necessarily true. Or wait, wait, p^4 is (p^2)^2, which is the square of p^2. But p is a prime, so p^2 is a composite number. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime, which would be p^2. But Q is p^4, which is the square of p^2, not a prime. So I is false.\n\nII. Q is the fourth power of a prime number. That would be p^4. Oh, wait, that's exactly what we have. So statement II is true.\n\nIII. Q is the product of two prime numbers. That would imply that Q is p * q, where p and q are primes. Then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1) = 4, which is less than 5. So III is not true.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, if Q is the product of two primes, then the number of factors is 4. So statement III is false.\n\nSo, looking back at the options, only statement II is correct.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me think again about statement I. Statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So if Q is p^4, can it be written as the square of a prime? Let me see. Let's say p is a prime, so p^2 is the square of p. Then (p^2)^2 is p^4, which is Q. So, is Q the square of a prime? Well, wait, p^2 is a composite number, not a prime. So the square is of a composite number. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime, which would be (prime)^2. But Q is (prime^2)^2, which is (prime^2) squared, which is a composite number squared. So statement I is not correct.\n\nSo, the only statement that must be true is statement II.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake. So, what if Q is p^4, then is that the square of a prime? Because p^4 is (p^2)^2, and p is prime. So p^2 is a square, but p is a prime. So the square of a prime is p^2, but p^4 is the square of p^2, which is a composite number. So statement I is saying Q is the square of a prime, which would be p^2. So in this case, Q is p^4, which is not the square of a prime. So statement I is incorrect.\n\nSo, the correct answer would be statement II only.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is II only. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me check all the options again. The options are:\n\nA) I only\nB) III only\nC) II only\nD) I and II only\nE) I and III only.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C.\n",

Hmm, let me think about how the number of factors works.\n\nWait, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Like, if a number N can be written as a product of primes raised to exponents, such as N = p\u2081^a * p\u2082^b * ... then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)... and so on for each prime.\n\nSo, Q has 5 factors. 5 is a prime number, right? So the only way to express 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 \u00d7 1. That means the exponents plus one multiply to 5. So for the exponents, we must have a situation where one exponent is 4 (since 4+1=5) and the others are 0. Because any other combination would require more than one exponent contributing, but 5 is prime.\n\nWait, but can we have multiple primes? Let me think. Suppose Q is the product of two primes, like p and q. Then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1) = 4. That's four factors, which is less than 5. So that can't be. If it's three primes, it would be (1+1)(1+1)(1+1)=8, which is more. So that's not it either.\n\nWhat if it's a single prime raised to a power? Let's say p^4. Then the number of factors is 4+1=5. That fits. So Q must be the square of a prime? Wait, no. Wait, p squared would be p^2, which has 3 factors. Wait, p^4 is p squared squared, so p^4 has exponents 4, so (4+1)=5 factors. So yes, if Q is a prime raised to the 4th power, it would have 5 factors.\n\nWait, but wait, another thought. Are there any other possibilities? Because sometimes numbers can have exponents in different primes, but in this case, since 5 is prime, the only way is for a single prime to the 4th power. So, for example, 16 is 2^4 and has 5 factors: 1, 2,4,8,16.\n\nSo, looking back at the options:\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime number. Wait, no. Wait, the square of a prime would be p^2, which has 3 factors. So I is not correct. Wait, but wait, the square of a prime is p^2, which has 3 factors, but our Q is p^4, which is the fourth power. So statement I is saying it's the square, which would have 3 factors, but Q has 5, so I is incorrect. Wait, so I is false?\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me clarify. The square of a prime is p\u00b2, which has 3 factors. So if Q is p^4, then it's the fourth power, not the square. So statement I says Q is the square, which would be incorrect. So statement I is false.\n\nHmm, but wait, another possibility: What if Q is p^4, which is the square of p squared. Because p^4 = (p\u00b2)^2. So, is that considered the square of a prime squared? Or does the statement I mean that Q is the square of a single prime, regardless of the exponent? So, statement I says Q is the square of a prime number. So p^4 is (p\u00b2)^2, but p squared is a composite number (unless p is 2, but still, the square is 4, which is composite). So statement I is incorrect because Q is the fourth power, not the square.\n\nSo statement I is false. So that would mean that the correct answer doesn't include I. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me think again. Wait, I think I messed up. The statement I says \"Q is the square of a prime number.\" So, for example, if Q is 16, which is 2^4, then 16 is (2^2)^2, which is (4)^2. So 16 is the square of 4, which is not a prime. So Q is the square of a composite number in that case. So statement I would be false because the square is of a composite number, not a prime. So statement I is false.\n\nWait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe I'm thinking about this wrong. Let's consider Q as the square of a prime. If Q is p\u00b2, then number of factors is (2+1)=3. So that's not 5. So for Q to have 5 factors, it's p^4, which is the fourth power, not the square. So statement I is incorrect. So statement I is false.\n\nThen statement II: Q is the fourth power of a prime. That would be correct because p^4 would give exactly 5 factors. So statement II is true.\n\nStatement III: Q is the product of two primes. Well, if Q is the product of two distinct primes, like p * q, then number of factors is (1+1)(1+1)=4. So that's 4, not 5. So statement III is incorrect.\n\nWait, but wait. What if the two primes are the same, like p*p = p\u00b2. Then it's p squared, which has 3 factors. So that's not 5. So in any case, statement III is incorrect.\n\nSo the only correct statement is II.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is II only. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, the number of factors is 5. Since 5 is prime, the only way to write 5 as a product is 5\u00d71, which implies that the exponents plus one are 5 and 1. So, the exponents are 4 and 0. So, the number must be of the form p^4, where p is a prime. So statement II is correct.\n\nStatement I: is Q the square of a prime? The square of a prime is p\u00b2, which has 3 factors. So if Q is p^4, it's not the square of a prime, because p^4 is (p\u00b2)^2, and p\u00b2 is a composite number unless p is 2, but regardless, it's not a prime. So statement I is wrong.\n\nStatement III: product of two primes. If two primes are multiplied, like p * q, the number of factors is 4, which is less than 5. So statement III is wrong.\n\nSo only statement II is correct. So the answer is C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding which statements are true about a positive integer Q that has exactly 5 factors. Hmm, let me think about how the number of factors works.\n\nWait, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Like, if a number N can be written as a product of primes raised to exponents, such as N = p\u2081^a * p\u2082^b * ... then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)... and so on for each prime.\n\nSo, Q has 5 factors. 5 is a prime number, right? So the only way to express 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 \u00d7 1. That means the exponents plus one multiply to 5. So for the exponents, we must have a situation where one exponent is 4 (since 4+1=5) and the others are 0. Because any other combination would require more than one exponent contributing, but 5 is prime.\n\nWait, but can we have multiple primes? Let me think. Suppose Q is the product of two primes, like p and q. Then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1) = 4. That's four factors, which is less than 5. So that can't be. If it's three primes, it would be (1+1)(1+1)(1+1)=8, which is more. So that's not it either.\n\nWhat if it's a single prime raised to a power? Let's say p^4. Then the number of factors is 4+1=5. That fits. So Q must be the square of a prime? Wait, no. Wait, p squared would be p^2, which has 3 factors. Wait, p^4 is p squared squared, so p^4 has exponents 4, so (4+1)=5 factors. So yes, if Q is a prime raised to the 4th power, it would have 5 factors.\n\nWait, but wait, another thought. Are there any other possibilities? Because sometimes numbers can have exponents in different primes, but in this case, since 5 is prime, the only way is for a single prime to the 4th power. So, for example, 16 is 2^4 and has 5 factors: 1, 2,4,8,16.\n\nSo, looking back at the options:\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime number. Wait, no. Wait, the square of a prime would be p^2, which has 3 factors. So I is not correct. Wait, but wait, the square of a prime is p^2, which has 3 factors, but our Q is p^4, which is the fourth power. So statement I is saying it's the square, which would have 3 factors, but Q has 5, so I is incorrect. Wait, so I is false?\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me clarify. The square of a prime is p\u00b2, which has 3 factors. So if Q is p^4, then it's the fourth power, not the square. So statement I says Q is the square, which would be incorrect. So statement I is false.\n\nHmm, but wait, another possibility: What if Q is p^4, which is the square of p squared. Because p^4 = (p\u00b2)^2. So, is that considered the square of a prime squared? Or does the statement I mean that Q is the square of a single prime, regardless of the exponent? So, statement I says Q is the square of a prime number. So p^4 is (p\u00b2)^2, but p squared is a composite number (unless p is 2, but still, the square is 4, which is composite). So statement I is incorrect because Q is the fourth power, not the square.\n\nSo statement I is false. So that would mean that the correct answer doesn't include I. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me think again. Wait, I think I messed up. The statement I says \"Q is the square of a prime number.\" So, for example, if Q is 16, which is 2^4, then 16 is (2^2)^2, which is (4)^2. So 16 is the square of 4, which is not a prime. So Q is the square of a composite number in that case. So statement I would be false because the square is of a composite number, not a prime. So statement I is false.\n\nWait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe I'm thinking about this wrong. Let's consider Q as the square of a prime. If Q is p\u00b2, then number of factors is (2+1)=3. So that's not 5. So for Q to have 5 factors, it's p^4, which is the fourth power, not the square. So statement I is incorrect. So statement I is false.\n\nThen statement II: Q is the fourth power of a prime. That would be correct because p^4 would give exactly 5 factors. So statement II is true.\n\nStatement III: Q is the product of two primes. Well, if Q is the product of two distinct primes, like p * q, then number of factors is (1+1)(1+1)=4. So that's 4, not 5. So statement III is incorrect.\n\nWait, but wait. What if the two primes are the same, like p*p = p\u00b2. Then it's p squared, which has 3 factors. So that's not 5. So in any case, statement III is incorrect.\n\nSo the only correct statement is II.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is II only. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, the number of factors is 5. Since 5 is prime, the only way to write 5 as a product is 5\u00d71, which implies that the exponents plus one are 5 and 1. So, the exponents are 4 and 0. So, the number must be of the form p^4, where p is a prime. So statement II is correct.\n\nStatement I: is Q the square of a prime? The square of a prime is p\u00b2, which has 3 factors. So if Q is p^4, it's not the square of a prime, because p^4 is (p\u00b2)^2, and p\u00b2 is a composite number unless p is 2, but regardless, it's not a prime. So statement I is wrong.\n\nStatement III: product of two primes. If two primes are multiplied, like p * q, the number of factors is 4, which is less than 5. So statement III is wrong.\n\nSo only statement II is correct. So the answer is C.\n\n\nTo determine which statements about \\( Q \\) are true, we analyze the number of factors \\( Q \\) has. The number of factors of a positive integer is determined by its prime factorization. If \\( Q \\) has exactly 5 factors, and since 5 is a prime number, the only way to express 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is \\( 5 \\times 1 \\). This implies that \\( Q \\) must be of the form \\( p^4 \\), where \\( p \\) is a prime number. This is because the number of factors of \\( Q = p^4 \\) is \\( (4+1) = 5 \\).\n\n### Analysis of Each Statement:\n1. **Statement I: \\( Q \\) is the square of a prime number.**  \n   If \\( Q \\) were the square of a prime number, it would be \\( p^2 \\), which has \\( (2+1) = 3 \\) factors.
