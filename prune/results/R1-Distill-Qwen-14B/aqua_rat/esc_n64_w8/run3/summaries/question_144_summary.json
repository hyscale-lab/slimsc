      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says that events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6. Also, the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. I need to find the probability that event B occurs. The options are A) 0.5, B) 0.6, C) 0.7, D) 0.8, E) 0.9.\n\nHmm, okay. Since A and B are independent, that means the occurrence of one doesn't affect the other. So, I remember that for independent events, the probability of both occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. So P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B).\n\nNow, the problem gives me P(A) = 0.6. So I know that P(A) is 0.6. I'm looking for P(B).\n\nThe other piece of information is that P(A or B) is 0.96. Wait, P(A or B) is the probability that either A happens, or B happens, or both. I remember the formula for the probability of A or B occurring when they're not mutually exclusive.\n\nThe formula is P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Since they're independent, P(A and B) is P(A)*P(B). So substituting that, the formula becomes P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)*P(B).\n\nLet me plug in the known values. I know P(A or B) is 0.96, and P(A) is 0.6. So substituting these in:\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B)).\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6 P(B).\n\nHmm, simplifying the right side. Let's see, P(B) minus 0.6 P(B) is 0.4 P(B). So,\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4 P(B).\n\nNow, I can subtract 0.6 from both sides to solve for P(B). Let's do that:\n\n0.96 - 0.6 = 0.4 P(B).\n\n0.36 = 0.4 P(B).\n\nWait, because 0.96 minus 0.6 is 0.36, right? So, 0.36 equals 0.4 multiplied by P(B). To find P(B), I can divide both sides by 0.4.\n\nSo, P(B) = 0.36 / 0.4.\n\nCalculating that, 0.36 divided by 0.4. Let me think: 0.4 goes into 0.36 how many times? Wait, 0.4 times 0.9 is 0.36, because 0.4 * 0.9 = 0.36. So P(B) is 0.9?\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 0.9. So that's an option. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because 0.9 seems a bit high.\n\nWait, let me go through the steps again.\n\nWe have P(A or B) = 0.96.\n\nP(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B).\n\nSo, 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B)).\n\nWhich is 0.96 = 0.6 + (1 - 0.6) P(B).\n\nBecause P(B) minus 0.6 P(B) is 0.4 P(B), which is (1 - 0.6) P(B).\n\nSo, 0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4 P(B).\n\nSubtract 0.6: 0.36 = 0.4 P(B).\n\nDivide both sides by 0.4: 0.36 / 0.4 = 0.9.\n\nSo yes, P(B) is 0.9. That's option E.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. Let me think about this again. If P(B) is 0.9, then P(A and B) would be 0.6 * 0.9 = 0.54.\n\nThen, P(A or B) would be 0.6 + 0.9 - 0.54 = 0.96. That adds up correctly. So yes, that seems right.\n\nBut let me think, is there another way to approach this? Another formula or approach that might confirm this?\n\nAnother approach: the probability that neither A nor B occurs is 1 - P(A or B) = 1 - 0.96 = 0.04.\n\nSince A and B are independent, the probability that neither occurs is (1 - P(A)) * (1 - P(B)).\n\nSo, (1 - 0.6) * (1 - P(B)) = 0.4 * (1 - P(B)).\n\nAnd this equals 0.04.\n\nSo, 0.4*(1 - P(B)) = 0.04.\n\nDivide both sides by 0.4: 1 - P(B) = 0.1.\n\nSo, P(B) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9.\n\nSame result. So that confirms it.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E) 0.9.\n",

So,\n\nP(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)*P(B) because independence.\n\nSo, 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B))\n\nLet me simplify the right side. Let me factor out P(B):\n\n0.6 + P(B) * (1 - 0.6) = 0.6 + 0.4 * P(B)\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4 * P(B)\n\nSubtracting 0.6 from both sides:\n\n0.96 - 0.6 = 0.4 * P(B)\n0.36 = 0.4 * P(B)\n\nWait, 0.96 minus 0.6 is 0.36?

Let me compute that. 0.36 divided by 0.4 is the same as 36/40, which is 0.9. Oh wait, no, 36/40 is 0.9? Wait, 40 times 0.9 is 36, yes. So P(B) is 0.9?\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option E is 0.9. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes I make mistakes in calculations.\n\nSo,\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6 P(B)\n0.96 = 0.6 + P(B)(1 - 0.6)\n0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4 P(B)\n0.96 - 0.6 = 0.4 P(B)\n0.36 = 0.4 P(B)\nP(B) = 0.36 / 0.4 = 0.9.\n\nYes, that seems correct.

But wait, the problem isn't directly asking about both events; it's about at least one of them happening.\n\nRight, the probability of at least one event occurring, P(A or B), is given as 0.96. I think the formula for this is P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) is P(A)*P(B).

The options are A) 0.5, B) 0.6, C) 0.7, D) 0.8, E) 0.9.\n\nHmm, right. Since A and B are independent, their probabilities multiply when considering both happening. But wait, I'm not directly dealing with both happening, but rather the probability of at least one happening. Oh right, the formula for the probability of at least one of two events is P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B). Because if I just add P(A) and P(B), I'm double-counting the overlap where both occur, so I subtract that overlap.\n\nSo, given that, the formula is P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B). I know P(A) is 0.6, and P(A \u222a B) is 0.96. I need to find P(B).\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. Let me denote P(B) as x for now. So,\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + x - (0.6 * x)\n\nWait, because P(A) and P(B) are independent, so P(A \u2229 B) is P(A)*P(B) which is 0.6x.\n\nSo expanding the equation:\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + x - 0.6x\n\nLet me combine like terms. x minus 0.6x is 0.4x. So:\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4x\n\nNow, subtract 0.6 from both sides:\n\n0.96 - 0.6 = 0.4x\n\nWhich is 0.36 = 0.4x\n\nThen, solving for x: x = 0.36 / 0.4\n\n0.36 divided by 0.4 is the same as 36 divided by 40, which is 0.9. Wait, no, wait. 0.4 times 0.9 is 0.36. So x is 0.9?\n\nBut wait, wait a minute. Let me double-check my math. 0.4x = 0.36. So x = 0.36 / 0.4.\n\nHmm, 0.36 divided by 0.4. Let's compute that: 0.36 \u00f7 0.4. Well, 0.4 is the same as 2/5. So 0.36 divided by (2/5) equals 0.36 * (5/2) = (0.36 *5)/2 = 1.8 /2 = 0.9. Oh right, so x is 0.9. So the probability that event B occurs is 0.9, which is option E.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me think again. If event A has a 60% chance, and B has a 90% chance, are they independent? Let me check the probability of both A and B happening. 0.6 * 0.9 is 0.54. Then, the probability of at least one happening is 0.6 + 0.9 - 0.54 = 1.5 - 0.54 = 0.96, which matches the given value.

Oh right, the formula for the probability of at least one of two events is P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B). Because if I just add P(A) and P(B), I'm double-counting the overlap where both occur, so I subtract that overlap.\n\nSo, given that, the formula is P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B). I know P(A) is 0.6, and P(A \u222a B) is 0.96. I need to find P(B).\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. Let me denote P(B) as x for now. So,\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + x - (0.6 * x)\n\nWait, because P(A) and P(B) are independent, so P(A \u2229 B) is P(A)*P(B) which is 0.6x.\n\nSo expanding the equation:\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + x - 0.6x\n\nLet me combine like terms. x minus 0.6x is 0.4x. So:\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4x\n\nNow, subtract 0.6 from both sides:\n\n0.96 - 0.6 = 0.4x\n\nWhich is 0.36 = 0.4x\n\nThen, solving for x: x = 0.36 / 0.4\n\n0.36 divided by 0.4 is the same as 36 divided by 40, which is 0.9. Wait, no, wait. 0.4 times 0.9 is 0.36. So x is 0.9?\n\nBut wait, wait a minute. Let me double-check my math. 0.4x = 0.36. So x = 0.36 / 0.4.\n\nHmm, 0.36 divided by 0.4. Let's compute that: 0.36 \u00f7 0.4. Well, 0.4 is the same as 2/5. So 0.36 divided by (2/5) equals 0.36 * (5/2) = (0.36 *5)/2 = 1.8 /2 = 0.9. Oh right, so x is 0.9. So the probability that event B occurs is 0.9, which is option E.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me think again. If event A has a 60% chance, and B has a 90% chance, are they independent? Let me check the probability of both A and B happening. 0.6 * 0.9 is 0.54. Then, the probability of at least one happening is 0.6 + 0.9 - 0.54 = 1.5 - 0.54 = 0.96, which matches the given value. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer must be E) 0.9.\n\n\nThe problem involves two independent events, A and B. The probability that event A occurs is given as \\( P(A) = 0.6 \\), and the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is \\( P(A \\cup B) = 0.96 \\). To find \\( P(B) \\), we use the formula for the probability of at least one of two independent events occurring:\n\n\\[\nP(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B)\n\\]\n\nLet \\( P(B) = x \\). Substituting the known values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n0.96 = 0.6 + x - (0.6x)\n\\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\\[\n0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4x\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\( 0.6 \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n0.36 = 0.4x\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{0.36}{0.4} = 0.9\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that event B occurs is \\( 0.9 \\). Verifying, if \\( P(A) = 0.6 \\) and \\( P(B) = 0.9 \\), the probability of both events occurring is \\( 0.6 \\times 0.9 = 0.54 \\). Substituting back into the formula:\n\n\\[\nP(A \\cup B) = 0.6 + 0.9 - 0.54 = 0.96\n\\]\n\nThis matches the given value, confirming the solution is correct. Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is:\n\n**Answer: E**",

Let me compute that: 0.6 + 0.9 is 1.5. 0.6 * 0.9 is 0.54. So 1.5 - 0.54 is 0.96. Yep, that's correct. So the calculation seems right.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 0.9.

The formula for the probability of at least one event occurring is:\n\n\\[\nP(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\n0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 \\cdot P(B))\n\\]\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n\\[\n0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4 \\cdot P(B)\n\\]\n\nSubtract 0.6 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n0.36 = 0.4 \\cdot P(B)\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 0.4:\n\n\\[\nP(B) = \\frac{0.36}{0.4} = 0.9\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that event B occurs is \\( P(B) = 0.9 \\).\n\nTo verify, the formula can also be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nP(A \\cup B) = 1 - P(\\text{neither } A \\text{ nor } B)\n\\]\n\nSince \\( P(\\text{neither } A \\text{ nor } B) = (1 - P(A)) \\cdot (1 - P(B)) \\), substituting the values:\n\n\\[\n0.96 = 1 - (0.4 \\cdot (1 - P(B)))\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n0.96 = 1 - 0.4 + 0.4 \\cdot P(B)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4 \\cdot P(B)\n\\]\n\nThis confirms the earlier calculation, leading to \\( P(B) = 0.9 \\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n**Answer: E**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says that events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6. Also, the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. I need to find the probability that event B occurs, and choose the correct option from A to E.\n\nHmm, I remember that when events are independent, the probability of both happening is the product of their individual probabilities. So, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). But wait, the question is about at least one of them occurring, which is P(A or B). Oh right, the formula for that is P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B), because if I just add them, I'm double-counting the overlap.\n\nSo, since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.6 * P(B). Let me denote P(B) as x for simplicity. So, x is what I need to find.\n\nThe formula for P(A or B) is then 0.6 + x - (0.6 * x) = 0.96.\n\nWait, let me write that out:\n\nP(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B)\nSo, substituting the known values:\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + x - (0.6 * x)\n\nHmm, let's compute this equation. Let me simplify the right-hand side.\n\n0.6 + x - 0.6x = 0.6 + x(1 - 0.6) = 0.6 + 0.4x.\n\nSo, 0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4x.\n\nSubtract 0.6 from both sides:\n\n0.96 - 0.6 = 0.4x\n0.36 = 0.4x\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx = 0.36 / 0.4\nx = 0.9\n\nWait, so P(B) is 0.9? That's option E.\n\nBut wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes I get mixed up with decimals.\n\nSo, 0.36 divided by 0.4: 0.4 goes into 0.36 how many times? 0.4 times 0.9 is 0.36, so yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 0.36 divided by 0.4 is the same as 36/40, which is 9/10, so 0.9. Yep, that's right.\n\nSo the probability of event B occurring is 0.9, which is option E.\n",
