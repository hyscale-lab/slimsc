      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this algebra problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again: the problem says that 6x minus y equals 24, and y is equal to 3x. I need to find the value of x, and the options are A)8, B)9, C)10, D)11, E)12.\n\nHmm, so I remember from class that when you have a system of equations, you can substitute one equation into the other to solve for a variable. Since y is given as 3x, that should make things easier. Let me write down the equations again to visualize it better.\n\nThe first equation is 6x - y = 24. The second equation is y = 3x. So, I can substitute y in the first equation with 3x because they're equal. That way, I'll have an equation with only x, which I can solve.\n\nSubstituting y with 3x in the first equation gives me 6x - 3x = 24. Let me do that calculation step by step. 6x minus 3x is 3x. So now the equation is 3x = 24.\n\nTo find x, I need to divide both sides of the equation by 3. So, 3x divided by 3 is x, and 24 divided by 3 is 8. So x equals 8. Wait, but let me double-check that. If x is 8, then y should be 3 times 8, which is 24. Plugging those back into the first equation: 6 times 8 is 48, and 48 minus 24 is 24. Yep, that checks out because 24 equals 24. So x is indeed 8.\n\nLooking back at the options, A is 8, so that's the correct answer. But wait, did I do everything right? Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in substitution. Oh no, wait, the first equation is 6x minus y, and substituting y gives 6x - 3x, which is 3x. So 3x equals 24, x is 8. Yep, that's right. I think I got it right the first time.\n",

The options are A)8, B)9, C)10, D)11, E)12. Alright, I think I can figure this out.\n\nWait, I remember that when you have two equations with two variables, you can substitute one into the other. So here, we have two equations. The first one is 6x - y = 24, and the second is y = 3x. That makes sense because y is expressed in terms of x in the second equation. So I can substitute y in the first equation with 3x. Let me write that down.\n\nSo substituting, the first equation becomes 6x - (3x) = 24. Because wherever y is, I replace it with 3x. Oh wait, right, that's substitution. Now I can simplify this equation to solve for x.\n\nLet me compute 6x minus 3x. 6x - 3x is 3x. So now the equation is 3x = 24. To find x, I just need to divide both sides by 3. So 3x divided by 3 is x, and 24 divided by 3 is 8. So x equals 8. That's one of the options, right? Let me check the options again. Option A is 8, so that should be the answer.\n\nWait, did I do everything correctly? Let me double-check. Substitute y with 3x: 6x - 3x = 24. 6x minus 3x is 3x, so 3x=24. Divide both sides by 3: x=8.
