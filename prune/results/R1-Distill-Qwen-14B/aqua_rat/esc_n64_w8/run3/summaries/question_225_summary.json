      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question is about a rectangular parking space. They painted three of its sides. The unpainted side has a length of 9 feet. The sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet. I need to find the area of the parking space.\n\nHmm, rectangles have opposite sides equal. So, if it's a rectangle, let's think about the sides. Normally, a rectangle has two lengths and two widths. So, if three sides are painted, then one side is not painted.\n\nWait, but which side isn't painted? Could be either a length or a width. Oh right, but the problem says the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet. So that's either the length or the width.\n\nLet me think. So, if it's a rectangle, imagine looking at it from a corner. Let's say the three painted sides are two widths and one length, leaving the other length unpainted. Or the opposite: three sides painted could be two lengths and one width, leaving the other width unpainted.\n\nWait, the problem says the unpainted side is 9 feet. So, if the unpainted side is a length, then the other length is 9. Or if it's a width, then the other width is 9.\n\nI think I need to set up some variables. Let me let the length be L and the width be W.\n\nCase 1: Suppose the unpainted side is the length. So, the unpainted side is L = 9. Then the three painted sides would be the other length (which is also 9) and the two widths. So the painted sides would be 9 + W + W. The sum is 37.\n\nSo equation: 9 + 2W = 37. Let's solve for W.\n\n2W = 37 -9 = 28. So W=14.\n\nThen area would be L * W = 9 *14 = 126. So that's option C.\n\nCase 2: Suppose the unpainted side is the width. Then W=9. The three painted sides would be the two lengths and one width. So the painted sum is L + L + W.\n\nSo equation: 2L +9 =37. 2L=28, so L=14.\n\nThen area is L * W =14 *9=126. Same as before.\n\nWait, so whether the unpainted side is length or width, the area ends up being 126. So the answer should be 126.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 126. So the answer must be C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes the setup could vary, but in this case, regardless of which side is unpainted, the area is the same because multiplication is commutative. So whether it's length or width, the product L*W is the same as W*L.\n\nSo yes, the area is 126. So the correct option is C.\n",

Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe problem says that three of the sides are painted, and the fourth side is unpainted. The length of the unpainted side is 9 feet. Also, the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet. I need to find the area of the parking space.\n\nHmm. Since it's a rectangle, it has two lengths and two widths, right? Let me visualize this. Let's say the rectangle has length L and width W. If they painted three sides, one of them must be the unpainted side. Wait, no, the unpainted side is just one, so the other three are painted.\n\nWait, maybe the rectangle is longer in one direction. So, perhaps two sides are lengths and one is a width, or two widths and one length. Because in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So if three sides are painted, the unpainted side must be the one opposite to one of the painted sides. Let me think.\n\nLet me try to define variables. Let me assume that the length is L and the width is W. The sides are painted on three sides, so maybe two lengths and one width are painted. Alternatively, two widths and one length. The unpainted side would then be the remaining width or length.\n\nWait, but the problem says the unpainted side is 9 feet. So if the unpainted side is a length, then L is 9. Or if it's a width, then W is 9.\n\nSo let's consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: The unpainted side is the length (L=9). Then the painted sides would be two widths (each W) and one length. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, because if the unpainted side is a length, then the other three sides would consist of two widths and one length. So the sum of painted sides would be W + W + L = 2W + L.\n\nBut wait, the sum of the painted sides is given as 37. So if L=9, then 2W +9=37. So 2W=28, so W=14. Then the area would be L * W = 9 *14=126. So that's one possibility.\n\nCase 2: The unpainted side is the width (W=9). Then the painted sides would be two lengths (each L) and one width. So the sum is L + L + W = 2L +9=37. So 2L=28, L=14. Then the area is L*W=14*9=126. Same as before.\n\nWait, so in both cases, the area is the same. That makes sense because whether the unpainted side is length or width, the product remains the same.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me double-check. Because in the first case, when unpainted is length (L=9), painted sides are two widths and one length. So sum is 2W + L = 37. Then 2W +9=37 \u2192 W=14. So area is 9*14=126.\n\nIn the second case, unpainted is width (W=9), painted sides are two lengths and one width. So sum is 2L +9=37 \u2192 2L=28 \u2192 L=14. Area is 14*9=126.\n\nSo in either case, the area is 126. So the correct answer would be option C, which is 126.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me re-calculate.\n\nCase 1: L=9 (unpainted), so painted sides are 2W + L.\n\nSum of painted = 2W +9 =37 \u2192 2W=28 \u2192 W=14. Area is 9*14=126.\n\nCase 2: W=9 (unpainted), painted sides are 2L + W=2L +9=37 \u2192 2L=28 \u2192 L=14. Area is 14*9=126.\n\nYes, same result.

So yeah, either case leads to the same area calculation.\n\nSo the correct answer should be 126, which is option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Unpainted Side**: The length of the unpainted side is 9 feet. This could either be the length (L) or the width (W) of the rectangle.\n2. **Painted Sides**: The sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet. Since three sides are painted, the painted sides could be:\n   - Two widths and one length (2W + L = 37), if the unpainted side is a length (L = 9).\n   - Two lengths and one width (2L + W = 37), if the unpainted side is a width (W = 9).\n\n3. **Case 1**: If the unpainted side is the length (L = 9), then the painted sides are 2W + L = 37. Substituting L = 9:\n   \\[\n   2W + 9 = 37 \\implies 2W = 28 \\implies W = 14\n   \\]\n   The area of the rectangle is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = L \\times W = 9 \\times 14 = 126 \\, \\text{square feet}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Case 2**: If the unpainted side is the width (W = 9), then the painted sides are 2L + W = 37. Substituting W = 9:\n   \\[\n   2L + 9 = 37 \\implies 2L = 28 \\implies L = 14\n   \\]\n   The area of the rectangle is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = L \\times W = 14 \\times 9 = 126 \\, \\text{square feet}.\n   \\]\n\nIn both cases, the area of the parking space is 126 square feet. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: C**",

Three sides are painted, and the sum of the painted sides is 37 feet. The unpainted side is 9 feet long. We analyze two cases based on whether the unpainted side is a length or a width.\n\n### Case 1: Unpainted side is a length (\\( l = 9 \\))\nThe painted sides consist of the other length and both widths. The equation becomes:\n\\[\nl + 2w = 37\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( l = 9 \\):\n\\[\n9 + 2w = 37\n\\]\n\\[\n2w = 28 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad w = 14\n\\]\nThe area is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = l \\times w = 9 \\times 14 = 126 \\, \\text{square feet}.\n\\]\n\n### Case 2: Unpainted side is a width (\\( w = 9 \\))\nThe painted sides consist of two lengths and the other width. The equation becomes:\n\\[\n2l + w = 37\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( w = 9 \\):\n\\[\n2l + 9 = 37\n\\]\n\\[\n2l = 28 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad l = 14\n\\]\nThe area is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = l \\times w = 14 \\times 9 = 126 \\, \\text{square feet}.\n\\]\n\nIn both cases, the area of the parking space is \\( 126 \\, \\text{square feet} \\).

Hmm. So, wait, a rectangle has four sides. If they painted three, that means one side is left unpainted. But which side is that? It could be either the length or the width, depending on how they set it up.\n\nThe problem gives me two pieces of information: the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet. And the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet. I need to find the area of the parking space, which would be length times width, right?\n\nLet me break this down. Let's call the length of the rectangle 'L' and the width 'W'. Now, I'm not sure whether the unpainted side is a length or a width. So I have to consider both possibilities.\n\nWait, wait. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So if three sides are painted, the fourth is not. So, perhaps two sides of one dimension and one of the other are painted. For example, maybe two widths and one length are painted, leaving the other length unpainted. Or it could be the other way around.\n\nLet me think. Let's suppose that the unpainted side is the length. So, in that case, the painted sides would be two widths and one length. So, the sum of the painted sides would be 2W + L = 37. And the unpainted length is L = 9. So substituting L as 9 into the equation, 2W + 9 =37. Subtract 9: 2W=28, so W=14. Then area would be L*W =9*14=126. Hmm, that's one of the options, option C.\n\nBut wait, what if the unpainted side is the width? Let's check that scenario. So, if the unpainted side is the width, then the painted sides would be two lengths and one width. So, the sum of painted sides is 2L + W =37. And the unpainted width is W=9. So substituting W=9, the equation becomes 2L +9 =37. Subtract 9: 2L=28 \u2192 L=14. Then area is L*W=14*9=126 again. Oh, same answer.\n\nWait a second, so regardless of whether the unpainted side is length or width, the area comes out the same. So the area is 126, which is option C.\n\nBut let me double-check my reasoning to make sure I didn't miss anything. So, if the unpainted side is the length, the painted sides are two widths and one length. So 2W + L =37. L=9. So 2W=37-9=28 \u2192 W=14. Area is 9*14=126.\n\nIf unpainted is width, then painted sides are two lengths and one width. 2L + W=37. W=9. So 2L=28 \u2192 L=14. Area 14*9=126.\n\nSo in both cases, the area is the same.
