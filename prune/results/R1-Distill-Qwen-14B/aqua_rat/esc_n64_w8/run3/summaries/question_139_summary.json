      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about two cars and their speeds. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work it out step by step. Let me read the question again.\n\nCar X covers 320 kilometers in 8 hours. Car Y covers 415 kilometers in 5 hours. I need to find the difference in their speeds. Hmm, right. Speed is distance divided by time, right? So I think I should calculate the speed of each car first.\n\nStarting with Car X. The distance is 320 km and time is 8 hours. So speed is distance over time. That would be 320 divided by 8. Let me do that calculation. 320 divided by 8 equals 40. So Car X's speed is 40 km/h.\n\nNow Car Y. Distance is 415 km, time is 5 hours. So 415 divided by 5. Let's see, 5 times 80 is 400, so 415 minus 400 is 15. 15 divided by 5 is 3. So 80 plus 3 is 83. So Car Y's speed is 83 km/h.\n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check that division. 5 times 83 is 415? 5 times 80 is 400, and 5 times 3 is 15, so yes, 400 +15=415. Yep, that's right.\n\nSo now I have both speeds: Car X is 40 km/h, Car Y is 83 km/h. The question asks for the difference in speed. So I subtract the two speeds. Which one is faster? Oh, Car Y is faster, so I subtract Car X's speed from Y's.\n\n83 minus 40 is 43. So the difference is 43 km/h. Looking at the options, option C is 43 km/h. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the cars. Oh, the question says difference, so it doesn't matter which is which as long as I subtract correctly. Because 40 from 83 is 43, same as 83 minus 40. So yeah, correct.\n\nI think that's it. So the correct answer is C.\n",
