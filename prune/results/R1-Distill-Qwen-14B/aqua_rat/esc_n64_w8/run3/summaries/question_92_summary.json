      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about telephone bills where the cost is partly fixed and partly varies with the number of calls. Hmm, I think I remember from math class that this is a linear cost model, maybe something like y = mx + b, where y is the total cost, m is the variable cost per unit, x is the number of units, and b is the fixed cost.\n\nLet me read the problem again. In the first month, 540 calls cost Rs.1800. Another month, 620 calls cost Rs.2040. And now we need to find the bill when 500 calls are made. The options are given as A to E.\n\nSo, I think I can set up two equations based on the given data. Let's denote the fixed cost as F and the variable cost per call as V. Then:\n\nFor the first month: F + 540V = 1800\nFor the second month: F + 620V = 2040\n\nNow I have two equations with two variables. I can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate F. Let me do that:\n\n(F + 620V) - (F + 540V) = 2040 - 1800\nSimplify the left side: F - F + (620V -540V) = 240\nSo that's 80V = 240. Oh, right, so V = 240 /80 = 3. So each call costs Rs.3.\n\nNow that I know V is 3, I can plug it back into one of the equations to find F. Let's take the first equation:\n\nF + 540*3 = 1800\nCalculate 540 *3: 540 *3 is 1620. So F + 1620 = 1800.\nSubtract 1620 from both sides: F = 1800 -1620 = 180. So the fixed cost is Rs.180.\n\nNow the problem asks for the bill when 500 calls are made. So plug into the equation:\n\nTotal bill = F + 500V\n= 180 + 500*3\n500 *3 is 1500. So 180 +1500 = 1680.\n\nLooking at the options, B is 1680. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake. Let's re-calculate F.\n\nUsing the first scenario: 540 calls, 1800 total.\n\n540 *3 =1620. 1800 -1620 =180. That seems right.\n\nSecond scenario: 620 calls. 620 *3=1860. Fixed cost is 180, so 1860 +180=2040. Which matches the given data. So the calculations are correct.\n\nTherefore, when 500 calls are made: 500*3=1500 +180=1680. So yes, B is the right choice.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a telephone bill that's partly fixed and partly varies with the number of calls. Hmm, I think this is a linear cost model where the total bill is a fixed cost plus a variable cost per call. Let me try to break it down.\n\nThe problem says that in a certain month, 540 calls resulted in a bill of Rs.1800. Another month had 620 calls and a bill of Rs.2040. I need to find out the bill for 500 calls. The options are given, so I should probably figure out the fixed and variable costs first.\n\nLet me denote the fixed cost as F and the variable cost per call as V. So, the total bill can be represented by the equation:\n\nTotal Bill = F + V * Number of Calls.\n\nSo for the first scenario:\n1800 = F + 540V.\n\nAnd for the second scenario:\n2040 = F + 620V.\n\nHmm, I can set up these two equations and solve for F and V. Let me subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate F.\n\n2040 - 1800 = (F + 620V) - (F + 540V)\n240 = 80V.\n\nSo, 80V = 240. Dividing both sides by 80 gives V = 3. So each call costs Rs.3.\n\nNow that I have V, I can plug it back into one of the original equations to find F. Let's use the first one:\n\n1800 = F + 540*3.\nCalculating 540 *3: 540 *3 is 1620.\n\nSo, 1800 = F + 1620. Subtract 1620 from both sides: F = 180.\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right. Because 180 + 540*3 = 180 + 1620 = 1800. Yes, that's correct. So fixed cost is Rs.180, variable cost per call is Rs.3.\n\nWait a second, but let me double-check. For the second scenario, F + 620*3 = 180 + 1860 = 2040. Yes, that matches. So F is indeed 180, V is 3.\n\nNow the question is, what's the bill when 500 calls are made? So total bill = 180 + 500*3.\n\nCalculating 500 *3 is 1500. Adding fixed cost: 180 + 1500 = 1680.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 1680. So the answer should be B.\n\nBut wait, did I make any mistakes in my calculations? Let me check again. \n\nF was found as 180 because 1800 - (540 *3) = 1800 - 1620 = 180.

So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, m is 3, correct because 240 divided by 80 is 3. Then, b is 180, yes because 3*540 is 1620, and 1800 -1620 is 180. Then for 500 calls: 3*500 is 1500, plus 180 is 1680. Yep, that seems right.\n\n\nThe telephone bill is modeled as a linear equation:  \n\\[\n\\text{Total Cost} = m \\cdot \\text{Number of Calls} + b\n\\]  \nwhere \\(m\\) is the variable cost per call, and \\(b\\) is the fixed cost. Using the given data:  \n\n1. For 540 calls, the bill is Rs. 1800:  \n\\[\n1800 = m \\cdot 540 + b\n\\]  \n\n2. For 620 calls, the bill is Rs. 2040:  \n\\[\n2040 = m \\cdot 620 + b\n\\]  \n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second to eliminate \\(b\\):  \n\\[\n2040 - 1800 = m \\cdot (620 - 540)\n\\]  \n\\[\n240 = m \\cdot 80\n\\]  \n\\[\nm = \\frac{240}{80} = 3\n\\]  \n\nNow, substitute \\(m = 3\\) into the first equation to find \\(b\\):  \n\\[\n1800 = 3 \\cdot 540 + b\n\\]  \n\\[\n1800 = 1620 + b\n\\]  \n\\[\nb = 1800 - 1620 = 180\n\\]  \n\nThus, the total cost equation is:  \n\\[\n\\text{Total Cost} = 3 \\cdot \\text{Number of Calls} + 180\n\\]  \n\nFor 500 calls:  \n\\[\n\\text{Total Cost} = 3 \\cdot 500 + 180 = 1500 + 180 = 1680\n\\]  \n\nThe bill for 500 calls is Rs. 1680.  \n\nAnswer: B",

Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nSo, the problem says the bill is partly fixed and partly varies with the number of calls. That means there's a base cost every month plus a variable cost that depends on how many calls are made. Hmm, I remember this is similar to a linear equation where the total cost is a function of the number of calls.\n\nLet's see the data given. In the first month, there were 540 calls, and the bill was Rs.1800. In another month, 620 calls cost Rs.2040. And the question is, what would the bill be when 500 calls are made?\n\nWait, so I think I can model this with an equation. Let me denote the fixed cost as F and the variable cost per call as V. So the total bill would be F + V * number of calls.\n\nSo, for the first scenario: 540 calls cost 1800. That gives me equation 1: F + 540V = 1800.\n\nThe second scenario: 620 calls cost 2040. That's equation 2: F + 620V = 2040.\n\nNow, I can subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate F. Let's do that:\n\n(F + 620V) - (F + 540V) = 2040 - 1800\nF - F + 620V - 540V = 240\n80V = 240\nSo, V = 240 / 80 = 3.\n\nOh, so each call costs Rs.3. Now, I can plug this back into either equation to find F. Let's use equation 1.\n\nF + 540*3 = 1800.\nCalculating 540 *3: 540 *3 is 1620. So,\n\nF + 1620 = 1800 \u2192 F = 1800 - 1620 = 180.\n\nSo the fixed cost is Rs.180, and each call is Rs.3.\n\nNow, the question asks for the bill when 500 calls are made. So total bill = F + V * 500.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: 180 + 3*500 = 180 + 1500 = 1680.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 1680. So the answer should be B.\n",
