      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, so the question is about a retailer selling an appliance. I need to find the selling price based on the information given.\n\nAlright, the problem says the retailer sold the appliance for 40 percent above cost, which is a gross profit of $20.00. Wait, so the profit is $20, and that's 40% above the cost. I think I need to find the cost price first, then add the profit to get the selling price.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's denote the cost price as C. The selling price (S) is 40% more than the cost, so S = C + 0.40*C = 1.40*C. Oh wait, but the profit is the difference between selling price and cost, right? So profit is S - C. \n\nGiven that the profit is $20, so S - C = $20. But since S is 1.40*C, substituting that in: 1.40*C - C = 0.40*C = $20. So 0.40*C = 20. To find C, I can divide both sides by 0.40. So C = 20 / 0.40. Let me calculate that. 20 divided by 0.4 is 50. So the cost is $50.\n\nNow, the selling price is 1.40 times the cost. So S = 1.40 * 50. Let's compute that: 50 * 1.4 is 70. So the selling price should be $70.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is $70.00. So that should be the correct answer.\n",

The question says the retailer sold it for 40 percent above cost, and that represented a gross profit of $20.00. I need to find out what the selling price was.\n\nWait, so what's the cost here? Oh right, cost is the price the retailer paid for the appliance. Let me denote the cost as 'C'. Then the selling price must be 40% more than C. So the selling price would be C plus 40% of C, which is the same as 1.4 times C, right?\n\nAnd the gross profit is the selling price minus the cost. The problem says the gross profit is $20.00. So, selling price minus cost equals $20. But wait, the selling price is 1.4C, so 1.4C minus C should be $20. Let me write that down:\n\nGross Profit = Selling Price - Cost\n$20 = (1.4C) - C\n\nSimplifying that, 1.4C minus C is 0.4C. So 0.4C = $20. To find C, I can divide both sides by 0.4. Let me calculate that: 20 divided by 0.4. Hmm, 0.4 times 50 is 20, so C is $50. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 0.4 times 50 is 20? Let me check: 0.4 *50=20? 0.4 is 40 cents, so 40 *50 is 2000 cents, which is $20. Yes, so C is $50.\n\nNow, the selling price is 1.4 times the cost. So 1.4 * 50. Let's see, 50 *1 is 50, 50 *0.4 is 20. So 50 +20=70. So the selling price is $70.\n\nLooking at the options, D is $70.00. So that's the answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything.

So, the cost is what the retailer paid for the appliance, and then they sold it 40% above that. That 40% increase is their profit, and that profit is $20. So, the 40% must be equal to $20.\n\nLet me think about percentages. If 40% of the cost is $20, then I can find the cost by calculating 100% of it. So, 40% is $20. So, the cost (let's call it C) times 40% equals $20. So, 0.4 * C = 20.\n\nTo find C, I can divide both sides by 0.4. So, C = 20 / 0.4. Let me compute that. 20 divided by 0.4 is the same as 20 divided by 2/5, which is 20 * (5/2) = 50. So, the cost is $50.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait a minute. Is the 40% calculated on the cost or the selling price? Oh, right, the problem says the selling price is 40% above cost. So the 40% is based on the cost, not the selling price.\n\nSo, the selling price is cost plus 40% of cost, which is 140% of cost. So, the selling price (S) is C + 0.4C = 1.4C.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a retailer selling an appliance. Let me try to break it down. The question says the retailer sold it for 40 percent above cost, and that represents a gross profit of $20.00. I need to find out the selling price. Hmm, right.\n\nWait, wait. Let me get this straight. So, the cost is the amount the retailer paid for the appliance. They sold it 40% above that cost. And the difference between the selling price and the cost is $20, which is the gross profit. So, I think I can model this with some equations.\n\nLet me define the cost as 'C'. The selling price (S) is 40% more than the cost. So, S = C + 40% of C. That's the same as S = C * (1 + 0.40) = 1.4 * C. Got it.\n\nNow, the profit is the selling price minus the cost. So, profit = S - C. They say the profit is $20. So, substituting S, that's (1.4C) - C = 0.4C. And 0.4C equals $20.\n\nSo, 0.4C = 20. To find C, I can divide both sides by 0.4. Let me calculate that: 20 / 0.4 is 50. So, the cost is $50.\n\nWait, but wait. The question is asking for the selling price, right? Oh right, because the options are in the 20s, 50s, etc. So, the selling price is 1.4 times the cost. Since C is $50, S = 1.4 * 50 = 70. So, the selling price is $70.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is $70. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait a second, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recheck the calculations.\n\nCost is $50. 40% of 50 is 20. So the selling price is 50 + 20 = $70. That gives a profit of $20. Yes, that's correct. So yeah, D is the right choice.\n",

I need to find out the selling price. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that gross profit is calculated as the selling price minus the cost price. Oh wait, right, that's correct. So if I denote the cost price as C, then the selling price (S) is C plus 40% of C. Or another way to put it, S is 140% of C because it's 40% above the cost.\n\nWait, let me get this straight. The problem says the selling price is 40% above cost. So that means S = C + 0.40*C.

Oh, so 0.4 times the cost equals 20. That makes sense because the profit is 40% of the cost.\n\nSo if 0.4*C = 20, then to find C, I can divide both sides by 0.4.

So, the selling price is 40% more than the cost. And the profit from that is $20. Profit is usually selling price minus cost, right? Or is it something else? Oh yeah, because profit is calculated on cost sometimes, but I'm a bit confused here. Let me think.\n\nSo, let me denote the cost price as C. The selling price (S) is 40% above cost.
