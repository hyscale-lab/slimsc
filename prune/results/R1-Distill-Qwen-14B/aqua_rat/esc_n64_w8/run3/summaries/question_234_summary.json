      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about simple interest, and I need to figure out the annual rate of interest. Hmm, let's break it down. I remember that simple interest is calculated using the formula I = P * R * T, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest per annum, and T is the time in years.\n\nThe problem says that the professors borrowed Rs. 5000, which is the principal. After 3 years, the interest earned is Rs. 300. So I can plug these values into the formula to find R.\n\nWait, let me make sure I get the formula right. Yes, I think it's I = P*R*T. So I know I is 300, P is 5000, T is 3. I need to solve for R.\n\nSo substituting the values, 300 = 5000 * R * 3. Let me write that out. 300 equals 5000 multiplied by R multiplied by 3. To solve for R, I can rearrange the equation. Dividing both sides by (5000 * 3) should give me R.\n\nCalculating the denominator first: 5000 times 3 is 15,000. So R equals 300 divided by 15,000. Let me do that division. 300 divided by 15,000 is the same as 3 divided by 150, which is 0.02. Oh wait, because 3 divided by 150 is 0.02. Because 150 times 0.02 is 3. So R is 0.02, which is 2%.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Is that right? Because 2% of 5000 over three years should give 300. Let me check that. 5000 * 2% is 100 per year. Over 3 years, that's 300. Oh yeah, that's correct. So the rate is 2% per annum.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 2%. So the answer should be A. But wait, let me check the options again. The options are A)2%, B)8%, C)5%, D)10%, E)None of these. So yes, A is the correct option. So the answer is A.\n",

Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait a second, maybe I flipped the equation. Let me check again. The formula is I = P * R * T. So 300 equals 5000 * R * 3. That's correct. So 5000 * 3 is 15,000. So 300 = 15,000 R. So R is 300 / 15,000, which is 0.02. Oh wait, wait a minute! Because 300 divided by 15,000 is 0.02, which is 2%. Oh, because 15,000 times 0.02 is 300. Right, so R is 2% per annum. That's option A.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Sometimes, I mix up the formula. Let me think again. Another way: The interest is principal times rate times time. So 5000 * R * 3 = 300. So R = 300 / (5000 *3) = 300/(15000) = 0.02. Yeah, 2% is correct. So the answer should be option A) 2%.\n\n\nTo determine the rate of interest per annum, we use the formula for simple interest:  \n\\[\nI = P \\cdot R \\cdot T\n\\]  \nwhere \\(I\\) is the interest, \\(P\\) is the principal amount, \\(R\\) is the rate of interest, and \\(T\\) is the time in years.  \n\nGiven:  \n- \\(P = 5000\\),  \n- \\(I = 300\\),  \n- \\(T = 3\\),  \n\nSubstitute these values into the formula:  \n\\[\n300 = 5000 \\cdot R \\cdot 3\n\\]  \nSimplify:  \n\\[\n300 = 15000 \\cdot R\n\\]  \nSolve for \\(R\\):  \n\\[\nR = \\frac{300}{15000} = 0.02\n\\]  \nConvert to percentage:  \n\\[\nR = 2\\%\n\\]  \n\nThus, the rate of interest per annum is **2%**, which corresponds to option A.  \n\nAnswer: A",
