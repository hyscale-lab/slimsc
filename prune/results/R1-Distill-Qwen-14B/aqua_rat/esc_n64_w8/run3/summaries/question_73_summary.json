      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the perimeter of a rectangle. Hmm, let me think. I remember that perimeter is the total distance around the shape. Oh right, for a rectangle, the formula is something like adding up all the sides. Wait, rectangles have two pairs of equal sides. So the length and width each appear twice.\n\nThe problem says the length is 8 centimeters and the width is 3 centimeters. Oh wait, right, so the perimeter would be 2 times the length plus 2 times the width. Or maybe 2*(length + width), I think that's the same thing. Let me write that down to be clear.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers: 2*(8 cm + 3 cm) = 2*(11 cm) = 22 cm. Wait, but wait, looking at the options, option A is 18 cm. Hmm, did I do that right? No, wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, 8 plus 3 is 11, multiplied by 2 gives 22. That seems right.

The width is 3 cm, so 2 times that is 6 cm. Then I add them together: 16 + 6 equals 22 cm. Oh wait, wait a second. Or wait, maybe I should think of it as adding the length and width first and then multiplying by 2. So, 8 +3 is 11, multiplied by 2 gives 22 cm. Either way, same result.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 22 cm. So that's the answer. The other options are higher or lower than that. Let me double-check. No, wait, no, 8 times 2 is 16, 3 times 2 is 6. 16+6 is 22. Yep, that's right.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the perimeter of a rectangle. Hmm, I remember that the perimeter is the total distance around the shape. Let me think about how to calculate that.\n\nThe rectangle has a length of 8 centimeters and a width of 3 centimeters. Wait, right, a rectangle has opposite sides that are equal. So there are two lengths and two widths. Oh wait, no, wait. No, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is something like 2 times the length plus 2 times the width. Or maybe it's 2*(length + width). Yeah, that makes sense because each pair of sides contributes length and width.\n\nSo, let me plug in the numbers. The length is 8 cm, so 2 times that is 16 cm. The width is 3 cm, so 2 times that is 6 cm. Then I add them together: 16 + 6 equals 22 cm. Oh wait, wait a second.
