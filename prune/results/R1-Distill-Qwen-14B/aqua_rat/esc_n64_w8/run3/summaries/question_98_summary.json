      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of problems. But let's try to break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says a man divides Rs 8600 among his 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews. Each daughter gets four times as much as each nephew, and each son gets five times as much as each nephew. I need to find out how much each daughter receives.\n\nHmm, so first, let's think about the variables. Let's say each nephew gets X rupees. Then, each daughter would get 4X, and each son would get 5X. That makes sense because the problem says each daughter gets four times as much as a nephew, and sons get five times.\n\nSo, let's list out how much each group gets:\n\n- Each nephew: X\n- Each daughter: 4X\n- Each son: 5X\n\nNow, the total number of people and their shares:\n\n- Number of sons =5, so total for sons is 5 * 5X =25X\n- Number of daughters=4, so total for daughters=4 *4X=16X\n- Number of nephews=2, so total for nephews=2 *X=2X\n\nSo adding all these together should equal the total amount, which is 8600.\n\nSo the equation would be:\n\n25X (sons) + 16X (daughters) + 2X (nephews) = 8600\n\nLet me add those up: 25+16 is 41, plus 2 is 43. So 43X = 8600.\n\nWait, 43X =8600. To find X, I divide both sides by 43.\n\nX=8600 /43. Hmm, what's 8600 divided by 43? Let me think. 43 times 200 is 8600 because 43*200 is 8600. Oh right, so X=200.\n\nSo each nephew gets 200 rupees.\n\nBut the question is about each daughter. Each daughter gets 4X. So 4*200 is 800.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 800. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nSo, 5 sons each get 5X. 5*5=25, times X (200) is 5000.\n\n4 daughters each get 4X. 4*4=16, times 200 is 3200.\n\n2 nephews each get X, so 2*200=400.\n\nAdding these: 5000 +3200 is 8200, plus 400 is 8600. Yep, that matches the total. So the calculation seems correct.\n\nSo each daughter gets Rs 800. So the correct option is E.\n",

I need to find out how much each daughter receives.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. I think I should assign variables to the amounts each group receives. Let's say each nephew gets X rupees. Then, each daughter would get 4X, right? Because the problem states each daughter gets four times as much as a nephew. And each son gets five times as much as a nephew, so each son gets 5X.\n\nWait, so the total amount each son gets is 5X, each daughter 4X, and each nephew X. Now, how many sons, daughters, and nephews are there?\n\nThe man has 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews. So, the total amount given to the sons would be 5 multiplied by each son's share. Similarly for daughters and nephews.\n\nLet me write this out:\n\nTotal given to sons = 5 * 5X = 25X\n\nTotal given to daughters = 4 * 4X = 16X\n\nTotal given to nephews = 2 * X = 2X\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait a second. Let me correct that. Each son gets 5X, so 5 sons would be 5 * 5X, which is 25X. Each daughter gets 4X, so 4 daughters would be 4 *4X=16X. Each nephew gets X, so 2 nephews would be 2*X=2X.\n\nSo the sum of all these should equal 8600. So adding them up: 25X + 16X + 2X = 8600.\n\nLet me add those numbers: 25X +16X is 41X, plus 2X is 43X.

That's 2x.\n\nFor the daughters, there are four of them, each getting 4x. So that's 4 * 4x = 16x.\n\nFor the sons, five of them each get 5x. So that's 5 *5x =25x.\n\nNow, adding all these up should equal the total amount, which is 8600. So the equation would be:\n\n2x (nephews) + 16x (daughters) +25x (sons) = 8600.\n\nLet me add those terms together. 2x +16x is 18x, plus 25x is 43x. So 43x = 8600.\n\nTo find x, I'll divide both sides by 43. So x = 8600 /43. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 43 times 200 is 8600 because 43*200 is 8600. So x is 200.\n\nWait, so each nephew gets 200 rupees. Then each daughter gets four times that, which is 4 * 200 = 800. So each daughter gets 800 rupees. Let me check the options. Option E is 800, so that must be the answer.\n\nWait a second, but wait, I should double-check my math. Let me make sure I added the coefficients correctly. 2x (nephews) + 4 daughters each getting 4x is 16x, and 5 sons each getting 5x is 25x. So 2+16+25 is 43, which is correct. 43x=8600, so x=200. That makes each daughter 800. Yep, that seems right. So the correct option is E.\n\n\nLet the amount each nephew receives be Rs. \\( x \\). Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives \\( 4x \\). Each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so each son receives \\( 5x \\).\n\nThe total amount distributed is Rs. 8600, and it is divided among:\n- 2 nephews: \\( 2x \\),\n- 4 daughters: \\( 4 \\times 4x = 16x \\),\n- 5 sons: \\( 5 \\times 5x = 25x \\).\n\nAdding these together gives:\n\\[\n2x + 16x + 25x = 43x\n\\]\nSince the total amount is Rs. 8600:\n\\[\n43x = 8600\n\\]\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{8600}{43} = 200\n\\]\n\nEach daughter receives \\( 4x = 4 \\times 200 = 800 \\) rupees. Thus, the amount each daughter receives is Rs. 800.\n\nAnswer: E",

The conditions are that each daughter gets four times as much as each nephew, and each son gets five times as much as each nephew. We need to find out how much each daughter receives.\n\nHmm, let's break it down. First, I think I should assign a variable to the amount each nephew gets. Let's say each nephew gets x rupees. Then, according to the problem, each daughter gets four times that, so each daughter would get 4x. Similarly, each son gets five times as much as each nephew, so each son gets 5x.\n\nNow, the man is dividing the total amount among all these people. So, the total money is the sum of what all the sons, daughters, and nephews receive.\n\nLet's calculate each group's total:\n\n- The 5 sons: each gets 5x, so 5 * 5x = 25x.\n- The 4 daughters: each gets 4x, so 4 * 4x = 16x.\n- The 2 nephews: each gets x, so 2 * x = 2x.\n\nAdding all these up should give the total amount, which is Rs 8600.\n\nSo, 25x + 16x + 2x = 8600.\n\nWait, let me add those numbers: 25 + 16 is 41, plus 2 is 43.

According to the problem:\n\n- Each daughter receives \\( 4x \\).\n- Each son receives \\( 5x \\).\n\nThe total amount distributed is Rs 8600. Calculating the total for each group:\n\n- Sons: \\( 5 \\times 5x = 25x \\).\n- Daughters: \\( 4 \\times 4x = 16x \\).\n- Nephews: \\( 2 \\times x = 2x \\).\n\nAdding these together:\n\n\\[\n25x + 16x + 2x = 43x\n\\]\n\nSince \\( 43x = 8600 \\), solving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{8600}{43} = 200\n\\]\n\nEach daughter receives \\( 4x = 4 \\times 200 = 800 \\) rupees. Verifying the total:\n\n- Sons: \\( 5 \\times 5x = 5000 \\),\n- Daughters: \\( 4 \\times 4x = 3200 \\),\n- Nephews: \\( 2 \\times x = 400 \\).\n\nAdding these: \\( 5000 + 3200 + 400 = 8600 \\), which matches the total amount.\n\nThus, each daughter receives Rs 800.\n\nAnswer: E",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where a man is dividing Rs 8600 among his 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews. The question is asking how much each daughter receives. Hmm, let's see. I need to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out the relationships between the amounts each group is getting. The problem says each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew. And each son gets five times as much as each nephew. So, I think I should assign a variable to the nephew's share and then express the others in terms of that.\n\nLet me denote the amount each nephew gets as 'x'. Then, each daughter would get 4x, and each son would get 5x. That makes sense.\n\nNow, how many people are getting each amount? There are 2 nephews, so their total would be 2 times x. The 4 daughters would each get 4x, so that's 4 * 4x = 16x. The 5 sons each get 5x, which is 5 * 5x = 25x.\n\nWait, let me make sure I get that right. For the sons: 5 sons * 5x each = 25x. Daughters: 4 *4x each =16x. Nephews:2 *x each =2x.\n\nSo the total amount is the sum of all these. So total = 25x (sons) + 16x (daughters) + 2x (nephews) = 43x.\n\nAnd the total money is Rs 8600. So 43x =8600.\n\nTo find x, I'll divide 8600 by 43. Let me calculate that. 43 times 200 is 8600, right? Because 43 * 200 is 8600. So x=200.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 43 times 200: 43 * 2 is 86, so 86 * 100 is 8600. Yes, that's correct. So x is 200.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for each daughter's share. Each daughter gets 4x, right? So 4 times 200 is 800.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 800. So that's the answer. But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSo, each nephew gets 200, each daughter gets 4*200=800, each son gets 5*200=1000.\n\nNow, the total would be:\n\nSons: 5 *1000 =5000\n\nDaughters:4 *800=3200\n\nNephews:2*200=400\n\nAdding them up: 5000+3200=8200; 8200+400=8600. Yes, that matches the total. So each daughter gets 800 Rs.\n\nSo the correct option is E) Rs 800.\n",
