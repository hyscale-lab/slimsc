      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about two balls rotating on a circular track. Hmm, I need to figure out when they'll both be back at the starting point again. Let me see.\n\nAlright, the problem says Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. And Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes. They start at the same point, and I need to find out when they'll both be back there again. \n\nWait, this sounds like a problem involving the least common multiple or something like that. Because I'm looking for a time when both of their rotations complete an integer number of times, bringing them back to the start.\n\nSo first, I think I should find the time each ball takes to complete one full rotation. That way, I can find their periods. \n\nFor Ball A: It does 2 rotations in 26 minutes. So one rotation would take 26 divided by 2, which is 13 minutes. Oh wait, 26 / 2 is 13. So Ball A's period is 13 minutes per rotation.\n\nFor Ball B: It does 5 rotations in 35 minutes. So one rotation would be 35 /5, which is 7 minutes. So Ball B's period is 7 minutes per rotation.\n\nNow, I need to find the time when both have completed an integer number of rotations. That would be the least common multiple (LCM) of their periods. Because LCM gives the smallest time that is a multiple of both periods.\n\nSo I need to calculate the LCM of 13 and 7. Hmm, 13 and 7 are both prime numbers. So their LCM would be 13 multiplied by 7, which is 91. So 91 minutes is the time when both balls are back at the starting point.\n\nWait, but the options are in hours and minutes. Let me convert 91 minutes into hours. 60 minutes is 1 hour, so 91-60=31. So that's 1 hour and 31 minutes. Looking at the options, option A is 1 hour 31 minutes. So that's the answer, right?\n\nWait a second, maybe I should double-check. Because sometimes when dealing with rotations, you have to consider if they're moving in the same direction or opposite, but the problem doesn't specify, so I think it's safe to assume they're moving in the same direction, so the LCM approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about their rotation speeds. Ball A's speed is 2 rotations /26 minutes. Ball B's speed is 5/35 = 1/7 rotations per minute. Oh wait, wait, let me compute their periods again. Wait no, their periods are 13 and 7 minutes respectively, so their speeds are 1/13 and 1/7 rotations per minute.\n\nBut regardless, the time when both return to the start is when each has completed an integer number of rotations. So the LCM of 13 and 7 is 91 minutes. So yes, 91 minutes is 1 hour and 31 minutes. So the answer should be option A.\n",

Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes. So I think I need to find the time when both have completed an integer number of rotations so they return to the starting point simultaneously.\n\nWait, right, this sounds like a least common multiple (LCM) problem. Because LCM gives the smallest time when both events coincide. But wait, wait. Let me think again. So each ball has a period\u2014the time it takes to complete one rotation. So I should find the periods of each ball first.\n\nFor Ball A: It makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes. So the time per rotation is 26/2 minutes. Let me calculate that. 26 divided by 2 is 13. So Ball A takes 13 minutes for one full rotation. So its period is 13 minutes.\n\nBall B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes. So its period is 35 divided by 5. That's 7 minutes per rotation.

Well, 60 minutes is an hour. So 90 minutes is one hour and 30 minutes. So 91 is one hour and 31 minutes. Let me check: 60 minutes is 1 hour. 91-60=31, so 1h 31m. So looking at the options, option A is 1h31m. But wait, wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, another way: Ball A completes a rotation every 13 minutes. So after t minutes, it would have done t/13 rotations. For it to be back at the start, t must be a multiple of 13. Similarly, Ball B is back at start when t is a multiple of 7. So the first t that is a multiple of both 13 and 7 is indeed their LCM, which is 91.\n\nSo the time is 91 minutes, which is 1 hour and 31 minutes.

Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes, and Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes. I need to figure out when they'll both be back at the starting point at the same time again. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I think I need to find out how long it takes each ball to complete one full rotation. Because if I know their individual periods, I can find the least common multiple (LCM) of those periods, which will tell me when they both align again.\n\nSo for Ball A: it makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes. That means one rotation takes 26 divided by 2, which is 13 minutes. So the period of Ball A is 13 minutes per rotation.\n\nFor Ball B: it makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes. So one rotation is 35 divided by 5, which is 7 minutes. So Ball B's period is 7 minutes.\n\nWait, wait. Oh, but wait, the periods are 13 and 7 minutes. Now, I need to find the LCM of 13 and 7. Because the LCM will be the smallest time when both balls have completed an integer number of rotations and are back at the starting point.\n\nSo, 13 and 7 are both prime numbers. Oh right, so their LCM is just 13 multiplied by 7, which is 91. So the LCM is 91 minutes.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me make sure. Because sometimes when dealing with rotation problems, the periods are the time for one full circle. So if Ball A takes 13 minutes per rotation, after 13 minutes, it's back. Ball B every 7 minutes.\n\nSo after 91 minutes, which is 13*7, Ball A would have done 7 rotations (91 /13=7), and Ball B would have done 13 rotations (91/7=13). So yeah, both are back at the starting point.\n\nBut wait, the options are in hours and minutes. So 91 minutes is how much? Let me calculate. 60 minutes is 1 hour. So 91 -60 =31, so that's 1 hour and 31 minutes. Looking at the options, option A is 1 hour 31, so that's the answer?\n\nWait, but wait. I think I might have made a mistake. Because the LCM approach is correct when they start together and we're looking for the next time they meet. But wait, another way to think about it: their rotation speeds.\n\nWait, another approach. The time they take to meet again is the LCM of their periods. So that part's correct.\n\nBut perhaps I should double-check the periods.\n\nBall A: 2 rotations in 26 minutes. So rotation time is 26/2=13 min. Correct.\n\nBall B:5 rotations in 35 minutes. So 35/5=7. Correct.\n\nSo LCM(13,7)=91. 91 minutes is 1h31m. So the answer should be option A.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 1h31. So the correct answer is A.\n",

Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes, and Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes. I need to figure out when they'll both be back at the starting point at the same time again. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I think I need to find out how long it takes each ball to complete one full rotation. Because if I know their individual periods, I can find the least common multiple (LCM) of those periods, which will tell me when they both align again.\n\nSo for Ball A: it makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes. That means one rotation takes 26 divided by 2, which is 13 minutes. So the period of Ball A is 13 minutes per rotation.\n\nFor Ball B: it makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes. So one rotation is 35 divided by 5, which is 7 minutes. So Ball B's period is 7 minutes.\n\nWait, wait. Oh, but wait, the periods are 13 and 7 minutes. Now, I need to find the LCM of 13 and 7.

Ball B every 7 minutes.\n\nSo after 91 minutes, which is 13*7, Ball A would have done 7 rotations (91 /13=7), and Ball B would have done 13 rotations (91/7=13).

Hmm, right, this sounds like a problem involving least common multiples or something like that.\n\nLet me read the problem again. Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. So, wait, that means in 26 minutes, it completes 2 rotations. So I guess each rotation takes 26/2 minutes, which is 13 minutes per rotation. Oh, wait no, that's not right.

So Ball A's period is 13 minutes per rotation.\n\nBall B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes. So similarly, that's 35 minutes for 5 rotations. So each rotation is 35 /5 =7 minutes. So Ball B's period is 7 minutes per rotation.\n\nWait, but the question is when will they be at the same starting point again. So that's when both have completed an integer number of rotations.

What's the LCM of 13 and 7? Well, 13 and 7 are both primes. So their LCM is 13*7=91 minutes.

Hmm, I remember something about least common multiples from math class, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think through this.\n\nAlright, the problem says Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. So, how long does it take Ball A to make one rotation? Well, if 2 rotations take 26 minutes, then one rotation would be 26 divided by 2. Let me calculate that. 26 divided by 2 is 13. So, Ball A takes 13 minutes per rotation.\n\nNow, Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes. So, how long does Ball B take per rotation? 35 minutes for 5 rotations means each rotation is 35 divided by 5. 35 divided by 5 is 7. So Ball B takes 7 minutes per rotation.\n\nWait, but I'm trying to find when both are back at the starting point. So that means I need to find a time when both have completed an integer number of rotations. Oh right, that's where LCM comes in. The least common multiple of their rotation times will give the next time they're both back at the starting point.\n\nSo, the rotation periods are 13 minutes and 7 minutes. I need to find the LCM of 13 and 7. Hmm, since 13 and 7 are both prime numbers, their LCM is just 13 multiplied by 7. Let me do that: 13 *7 is 91. So the LCM is 91 minutes.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Is that the time when both are back? Because each has to complete an integer number of rotations. So after 91 minutes, Ball A would have done 91 /13 = 7 rotations. And Ball B would have done 91 /7 =13 rotations. So yes, both are integers, so they are back at the starting point.\n\nBut wait, the options given are in hours and minutes. Let me convert 91 minutes into hours. 60 minutes is 1 hour, so 91 minus 60 is 31. So that's 1 hour and 31 minutes. Looking at the options, option A is 1 hour 31, option B is 2h31, etc.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me double-check. Because sometimes when you have the time for each rotation, you might need to think about their periods in terms of how often they complete a rotation. So, for Ball A, it takes 13 minutes per rotation. So the period is 13 minutes. For Ball B, it's 7 minutes. So the periods are 13 and 7.\n\nWait, the LCM of their periods is indeed 91 minutes. So 91 minutes is 1 hour and 31 minutes. So the answer should be option A.\n\nWait, but wait. Another approach: the number of rotations each makes is 2 in 26 minutes for A, which is 2/26 per minute. Or maybe I should think in terms of their rotation rates. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for when two events synchronize. The time when they meet again is the LCM of their periods. So, as I did before, the periods are 13 and 7, so LCM is 91 minutes. So 91 minutes is 1h31m, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again: the options start at A)1h31m. So that's the earliest time they meet again. So the correct answer is A.\n\nWait, but wait. Did I make a mistake in the LCM calculation? Let me recheck. 13 and 7 are primes, so LCM is 13*7=91. Yes, correct. So the answer is 91 minutes, which is 1h31m. So option A is correct.\n",

I need to find the LCM of 13 and 7. Hmm, since 13 and 7 are both prime numbers, their LCM is just 13 multiplied by 7. Let me do that: 13 *7 is 91. So the LCM is 91 minutes.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Is that the time when both are back? Because each has to complete an integer number of rotations. So after 91 minutes, Ball A would have done 91 /13 = 7 rotations. And Ball B would have done 91 /7 =13 rotations. So yes, both are integers, so they are back at the starting point.\n\nBut wait, the options given are in hours and minutes. Let me convert 91 minutes into hours. 60 minutes is 1 hour, so 91 minus 60 is 31. So that's 1 hour and 31 minutes. Looking at the options, option A is 1 hour 31, option B is 2h31, etc.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me double-check. Because sometimes when you have the time for each rotation, you might need to think about their periods in terms of how often they complete a rotation. So, for Ball A, it takes 13 minutes per rotation. So the period is 13 minutes. For Ball B, it's 7 minutes. So the periods are 13 and 7.\n\nWait, the LCM of their periods is indeed 91 minutes. So 91 minutes is 1 hour and 31 minutes. So the answer should be option A.\n\nWait, but wait. Another approach: the number of rotations each makes is 2 in 26 minutes for A, which is 2/26 per minute. Or maybe I should think in terms of their rotation rates. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for when two events synchronize. The time when they meet again is the LCM of their periods. So, as I did before, the periods are 13 and 7, so LCM is 91 minutes. So 91 minutes is 1h31m, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again: the options start at A)1h31m. So that's the earliest time they meet again. So the correct answer is A.\n\nWait, but wait. Did I make a mistake in the LCM calculation? Let me recheck. 13 and 7 are primes, so LCM is 13*7=91. Yes, correct. So the answer is 91 minutes, which is 1h31m. So option A is correct.\n\n\nTo determine when both balls A and B will be at their starting point again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their rotation periods.\n\n1. **Calculate the rotation period for each ball:**\n   - Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes, so its rotation period is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Period of A} = \\frac{26}{2} = 13 \\, \\text{minutes}.\n     \\]\n   - Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes, so its rotation period is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Period of B} = \\frac{35}{5} = 7 \\, \\text{minutes}.\n     \\]\n\n2. **Find the LCM of the rotation periods:**\n   - The rotation periods are 13 minutes and 7 minutes. Since 13 and 7 are prime numbers, their LCM is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{LCM}(13, 7) = 13 \\times 7 = 91 \\, \\text{minutes}.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Convert the LCM to hours and minutes:**\n   - 91 minutes is equivalent to:\n     \\[\n     91 \\, \\text{minutes} = 1 \\, \\text{hour} \\, \\text{and} \\, 31 \\, \\text{minutes}.\n     \\]\n\nThus, the two balls will be at the same starting point again after 1 hour and 31 minutes. The correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: A**",

The options are given, ranging from 1 to 5 hours and 31 minutes.\n\nWait, this sounds like a problem about finding when two events happen simultaneously again. Oh right, it's probably related to the least common multiple (LCM) of their rotation periods. Because LCM gives the smallest time when both events align.\n\nBut wait, I need to think about how to model their rotations. Each ball has a certain time it takes to complete one full rotation. So maybe I should find the time each takes for one rotation, then find the LCM of those times.\n\nBall A: 2 rotations in 26 minutes. So the time per rotation is 26/2 = 13 minutes per rotation.\n\nBall B: 5 rotations in 35 minutes.

Let me calculate. 60 minutes is 1 hour, so 91-60=31. So 1 hour and 31 minutes.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 1h31m. So that's the first option. But wait, is that correct? Because I thought the LCM of 13 and 7 is 91, which is 1h31m.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: maybe I should compute when the number of rotations for both is an integer. So perhaps the time t should be such that t is a multiple of 13 and 7. So LCM(13,7)=91 minutes.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check.

So LCM of 13 and 7 is 91. So t=91 minutes. Which is 1h31m. So yes, that's option A.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me think if there's any other way this could be approached.
