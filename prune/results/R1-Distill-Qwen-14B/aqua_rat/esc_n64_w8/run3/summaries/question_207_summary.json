      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because word problems can sometimes trip me up. Let me take it step by step.\n\nThe problem says: If 10 is subtracted from two-thirds of a number, the result is equal to the sum of 40 and one-third of the number. I need to find the number. The options are A)100, B)160, C)150, D)210, E)220.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. Let's call the number we're looking for \"x.\" So, the problem is about setting up an equation based on the description.\n\nFirst part: \"10 is subtracted from two-thirds of a number.\" That translates to (2/3)x minus 10. So, that's (2/3)x - 10.\n\nThe second part: \"the result is equal to the sum of 40 and one-third of the number.\" The sum would be 40 plus (1/3)x. So, that's 40 + (1/3)x.\n\nPutting it all together, the equation is: (2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x.\n\nNow I need to solve for x. Let's write that out.\n\n(2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x.\n\nI think the first step is to get all the x terms on one side and the constants on the other. So, subtract (1/3)x from both sides to eliminate it from the right.\n\n(2/3)x - (1/3)x -10 = 40.\n\nThat simplifies to (1/3)x -10 = 40.\n\nWait, because (2/3 minus 1/3) is 1/3. Right.\n\nNow, I'll add 10 to both sides to isolate the term with x.\n\n(1/3)x = 40 +10 \u2192 (1/3)x =50.\n\nTo solve for x, multiply both sides by 3.\n\nx =50 *3 \u2192 x=150.\n\nSo the number is 150, which is option C.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to mix up fractions sometimes.\n\nLet me plug 150 back into the original problem.\n\nFirst, two-thirds of 150 is (2/3)*150 = 100. Subtract 10, so 100 -10 =90.\n\nNow, the other side: sum of 40 and one-third of 150. One-third is 50, so 40 +50=90.\n\nYes, both sides are 90, so it checks out. So the correct answer is C)150.\n",

Let me translate each part.\n\nFirst part: \"10 is subtracted from two-thirds of a number.\" So that would be (2/3)x minus 10. Because two-thirds of x is (2/3)x, and then we subtract 10.\n\nThe result of that is equal to the sum of 40 and one-third of the number. So the sum is 40 plus (1/3)x. So putting it together, the equation is:\n\n(2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x.\n\nWait, okay, let me make sure I got that right. So the left side is 2/3 x minus 10, and the right side is 40 plus 1/3 x. That makes sense.\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. Let's see. Maybe I can get all the x terms on one side and the constants on the other.\n\nFirst, let's subtract (1/3)x from both sides to get rid of it on the right. So:\n\n(2/3)x - (1/3)x -10 = 40.\n\nWait, what's (2/3)x minus (1/3)x? That's (1/3)x. So now the equation is (1/3)x -10 = 40.\n\nThen, I can add 10 to both sides to isolate the x term. So:\n\n(1/3)x = 40 +10 \u2192 (1/3)x = 50.\n\nTo find x, I multiply both sides by 3. So x = 50 *3 = 150.\n\nWait, that's one of the options. Let me check the options again. Option C is 150.

The question says, \"If 10 is subtracted from 2/3 of a number, the result is equal to the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number. Find the number.\"\n\nHmm, okay. Let me break this down. So, there's a number we're trying to find. Let's call it 'x' for now. The problem gives an equation based on the description.\n\nFirst part: 10 is subtracted from 2/3 of the number. So that would be (2/3)x minus 10. Right? Because 2/3 of x is (2/3)x, and then subtract 10.\n\nThe second part says that this result equals the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number. So that's 40 plus (1/3)x.\n\nPutting it together, the equation is:\n\n(2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x\n\nWait, okay. Now I need to solve for x. Let's rearrange this equation.\n\nI think I should get all the x terms on one side and the constants on the other. So, let's subtract (1/3)x from both sides to get rid of it on the right.\n\n(2/3)x - (1/3)x - 10 = 40\n\nHmm, (2/3 - 1/3) is (1/3)x.

Maybe I made a mistake in the signs or the fractions.\n\nSo, the original equation:\n\n(2/3)x -10 = 40 + (1/3)x\n\nSubtract (1/3)x from both sides:\n\n(2/3 x - 1/3 x) -10 = 40\n\nWhich is (1/3 x) -10 =40.\n\nAdding 10 to both sides: (1/3 x) =50.\n\nMultiply by 3: x=150.\n\nSo the number is 150.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe problem says: If 10 is subtracted from two-thirds of a number, the result is equal to the sum of 40 and one-third of the number. I need to find the number. The options are A)100, B)160, C)150, D)210, E)220.\n\nHmm, right. So let me break this down. I'll probably need to set up an equation based on the description.\n\nLet me denote the number as x. So, two-thirds of the number would be (2/3)x. Then, 10 is subtracted from that, so that's (2/3)x - 10.\n\nOn the other side of the equation, the result is equal to the sum of 40 and one-third of the number. So that would be 40 + (1/3)x.\n\nSo putting it together, the equation is: (2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x.\n\nWait, that's correct? Let me make sure. Yeah, because 10 is subtracted from two-thirds of the number. So that's (2/3)x minus 10. On the other side, it's 40 plus one-third of the number, so 40 + (1/3)x.\n\nNow I need to solve for x. Let me write this equation again:\n\n(2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x.\n\nI think the next step is to get all the x terms on one side and the constants on the other. So maybe subtract (1/3)x from both sides to get rid of it on the right.\n\nSubtracting (1/3)x from both sides:\n\n(2/3)x - (1/3)x - 10 = 40.\n\nWait, that's (2/3 - 1/3)x -10 =40. Because when you subtract (1/3)x from (2/3)x, you get (1/3)x.\n\nSo now the equation is:\n\n(1/3)x - 10 = 40.\n\nNow I can add 10 to both sides to isolate the x term.\n\n(1/3)x = 40 +10 =50.\n\nSo (1/3)x =50.\n\nTo solve for x, I multiply both sides by 3.\n\nx=50*3=150.\n\nWait, so x is 150.

So 40 +50=90.\n\nYes, both sides equal 90, so x=150 is correct.\n\n\nLet the number be \\( x \\).
