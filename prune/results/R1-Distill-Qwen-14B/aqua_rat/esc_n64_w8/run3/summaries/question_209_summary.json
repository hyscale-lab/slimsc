Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer.\n\nWait, I remember something about the order of operations in math. Oh right, it's PEMDAS\u2014Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and then Addition and Subtraction. So I should handle the multiplication before the addition here.\n\nLet me break it down. The problem is 900 + 5 \u00d7 12. So first, I need to calculate 5 multiplied by 12. Let me do that. 5 times 12 is... 60, right? Yeah, because 5 times 10 is 50, and 5 times 2 is 10, so 50 plus 10 is 60.\n\nNow that I have that result, I can add it to 900. So 900 plus 60 equals... 960. That seems straightforward.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 960. So that must be the correct answer. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 5 times 12 is 60, yes. 900 plus 60 is definitely 960. \n\nI don't think I missed anything here.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here: 900 plus 5 times 12 equals what? Hmm, I think I should start by remembering the order of operations. Oh right, it's PEMDAS\u2014Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction. So in this case, there's no parentheses or exponents, but there is a multiplication part. \n\nLet me break it down. The problem is 900 + 5 \u00d7 12. Oh wait, so I should do the multiplication before adding. So first, I'll calculate 5 times 12. Hmm, 5 times 12 is 60, right? Because 5 times 10 is 50 and 5 times 2 is 10, so 50 +10=60. \n\nNow that I have that, I add that result to 900. So 900 plus 60. Let me do that addition. 900 plus 60 is 960. Wait, but wait, looking at the options, option E is 960. So that should be the answer. \n\nBut wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check. 5 multiplied by 12 is definitely 60. Then adding to 900: 900 +60 is 960. Yep, that's correct. \n\nWait, maybe I should look at the options again. Oh, option E is 960, so that's the one. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So the correct answer should be E.\n\n\nTo solve the equation \\( 900 + 5 \\times 12 \\), we follow the order of operations (PEMDAS). First, we perform the multiplication: \\( 5 \\times 12 = 60 \\).
