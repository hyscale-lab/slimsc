      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a hollow cube, and I'm supposed to figure out how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted after the outer surface is painted. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the cube is hollow and made of smaller 1cm\u00b3 cubes. The overall size is 5cm, but wait, does that mean each edge is 5cm long? I think so. So the cube is 5 cm on each side, but it's hollow, with a thickness of 1 cm. Oh right, because the thickness is 1 cm, that means the walls of the hollow part are 1 cm thick. So the inner part must be a smaller cube inside.\n\nWait, let me visualize this. The big cube is 5x5x5 cm. Since the thickness is 1 cm, the inner empty space would be a cube of (5-2*1) cm on each side. Because on each side, the thickness is 1 cm, so you subtract 2 cm from the total length. So 5-2=3, so the inner cube is 3x3x3 cm. But wait, the cube is hollow, so the material is only the outer 1 cm layer on each face.\n\nNow, the big cube is made up of 1 cm\u00b3 smaller cubes. So the total number of small cubes in the big cube is 5*5*5 = 125 small cubes. But since it's hollow, the inner 3x3x3 cube is empty. So the number of small cubes that are part of the structure is 125 - 27 = 98? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, because the hollow part is empty, so the material is the outer layer. So the small cubes used are the ones on the surface. So the total small cubes are 5^3=125. The hollow part is 3^3=27, so the material is 125-27=98 small cubes. So there are 98 small cubes in the structure.\n\nWait, but each small cube is 1 cm, so the total structure is 5x5x5, but the hollow part is 3x3x3. So that leaves a 1 cm thick shell.\n\nNow, the problem is about painting the outer surfaces. So the outer surfaces are painted, and we need to find how many faces of the small cubes remain unpainted.\n\nEach small cube can have up to three faces exposed, depending on its position in the structure. But when the outer surfaces are painted, some of their faces are painted, and others may not be.\n\nWait, but the question is about the total number of faces that remain unpainted across all small cubes.\n\nWait, each small cube in the structure can contribute up to three faces to the outside. The ones on the edges and corners will have more faces exposed. But when painted, those faces become painted. The question is about the total number of faces that are not painted.\n\nWait, but the cube is hollow. So, for each small cube, how many of its faces are on the outside, and how many are internal or on the hollow part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about all the small cubes and count their total faces, then subtract the painted ones.\n\nEach small cube has 6 faces. So for 98 small cubes, the total number of faces is 98 *6 = 588.\n\nBut some of these faces are on the outside and get painted, and others are internal.\n\nWait, but the hollow cube has only the outer surfaces painted. The inner surfaces (the hollow part) are not painted, so any small cubes that are on the inner surfaces would have those faces unpainted, but the problem says the outer surfaces are painted. So, the inner surfaces are not painted, so their faces are unpainted.\n\nWait, but in the hollow cube, the small cubes are only in the outer layer. So each small cube is part of the shell, so their inner faces are adjacent to the hollow space, which is not painted. So for each small cube, the faces that are on the inside (toward the hollow) are unpainted, and the faces on the outside may be painted.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's think about each face of the big cube.\n\nThe big cube has 6 faces, each of 5x5 cm, so each face has 25 small cube faces. So the total painted area is 6 *25 =150 small cube faces. But wait, each small cube on the edge or corner is shared between multiple faces, but the painting is on the outside, so each small cube face on the exterior is painted once.\n\nSo the total number of painted small cube faces is 6*(5*5) = 150.\n\nBut wait, no, because the small cubes on the edges are counted on multiple faces. But the painted faces are the ones on the surface. So each of the 6 faces of the big cube has 5x5=25 small faces. So total painted is 6*25=150.\n\nSo the total number of painted small cube faces is 150.\n\nEach small cube in the structure contributes some of its faces to the exterior, which are painted, and the others may be internal or adjacent to other small cubes.\n\nWait, but I'm trying to find the total number of unpainted faces across all small cubes.\n\nThe total number of small cube faces is 98*6=588.\n\nThe number of painted faces is 150.\n\nSo the unpainted faces would be 588-150=438.\n\nWait, that would be 438. But wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Because some of the small cube's faces are not on the exterior, but also not part of the hollow. Because the cube is hollow, the inner surfaces (those facing the hollow) are also unpainted. So each small cube in the shell has one face (the inner face) that is unpainted because it's adjacent to the hollow space. But wait, not all small cubes in the shell have an inner face.\n\nWait, no. The small cubes in the corners and edges would have more than one face on the exterior. Let me think again.\n\nWait, each small cube in the shell is part of the outer 1 cm layer. So for each small cube, the number of faces that are on the exterior is variable.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the number of small cube faces that are on the exterior (which is 150), and the number of small cube faces that are on the interior (the hollow part). Then, the total unpainted faces would be the interior faces plus any internal faces between small cubes.\n\nWait, but each small cube can have up to 3 exterior faces, but also, each has up to 3 interior faces (toward the hollow). No, that's not right. Because the hollow is the center, each small cube in the shell has one face adjacent to the hollow, except for those on the corners and edges.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as the shell. The shell is a 5x5x5 cube minus a 3x3x3 cube. So the shell is 1 cm thick on all sides.\n\nEach small cube in the shell has some number of faces on the exterior and some on the interior (hollow) and some adjacent to other small cubes.\n\nWait, but the hollow is the inner 3x3x3, so any small cube in the shell (the 1 cm layer) must be adjacent to the hollow on one face. So each small cube in the shell has exactly one face adjacent to the hollow, except for those on the edges where perhaps more than one face is adjacent? No, wait, no. Each small cube in the shell is in a single position, so it can have at most one face adjacent to the hollow. Because the hollow is the inner 3x3x3 cube. So each small cube in the shell is touching the hollow on exactly one face. Because they are in the outer layer.\n\nSo for each small cube in the shell, one face is adjacent to the hollow (unpainted), and the other five faces are either on the exterior (painted) or adjacent to other small cubes (unpainted).\n\nWait, no. Wait, each small cube is in a 3D grid. So each cube can have up to 6 adjacent neighbors. But in this case, the shell is 5x5x5, and the inner 3x3x3 is hollow.\n\nSo for a small cube in the shell, it's on the outer layer. So, for example, a cube at position (1,y,z) is on the left face, so one of its faces is on the exterior (left face), and another face (x=2,y,z) is adjacent to another small cube. But also, the face at x=1 is on the exterior, and the face at x=0 would be the hollow, but wait, no, because the hollow is in the center. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each small cube in the shell has exactly one face adjacent to the hollow, except for those on the edges. No, perhaps not. Because the hollow is in the center, so each cube in the shell is adjacent to the hollow on exactly one face. Because the shell is 1 cm thick, so each cube in the shell is just outside the hollow.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. For example, consider a cube on the top face of the big cube. Its position is (x,5,y). The face at z=5 is on the exterior. But its face at z=4 would be adjacent to the hollow if it's in the shell. Wait, no. Because the hollow is the inner 3x3x3 cube. So for the shell, any cube with x, y, z in 1 to 5, but excluding the inner 3x3x3. So for example, a cube at (1,2,3) is part of the shell. The face at x=1 is on the exterior. The face at x=2 is adjacent to the hollow (if the hollow is from x=2 to x=4, etc.)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model each small cube's position.\n\nEach small cube in the shell is on the outer layer, so their position is such that at least one of their x, y, or z coordinates is either 1 or 5 (assuming the cube is from 1 to 5 in each dimension). The inner hollow is from 2 to 4 in each dimension.\n\nSo, for each small cube in the shell, how many faces are adjacent to the hollow.\n\nTake a cube at (1,2,3). Its x=1 is on the exterior, so the face at x=1 is painted. The face at x=2 is adjacent to the hollow, so that face is unpainted. The other faces (y-1, y+1, z-1, z+1) are adjacent to other small cubes or to the hollow.\n\nWait, no. Let's think: the cube at (1,2,3) is on the x=1 face. The face at x=0 doesn't exist; the face at x=2 is adjacent to the hollow (since the hollow starts at x=2). So the face at x=2 is adjacent to the hollow and is unpainted. Similarly, any cube on the shell has one face adjacent to the hollow, except perhaps those on the edges or corners.\n\nWait, but a corner cube, like (1,1,1), is on the exterior. Its x=1, y=1, z=1 faces are on the exterior, so they're painted. The face at x=2 is adjacent to the hollow, but wait, the cube at (1,1,1) is in the shell, so its x=2 face would be adjacent to the cube at (2,1,1), which is part of the shell as well. Wait, no, because the hollow is from x=2 to x=4, so the cube at (2,1,1) is part of the shell. So the face of (1,1,1) at x=2 is adjacent to another small cube, not the hollow. So in this case, the face at x=2 is adjacent to another cube, so it's an internal face (unpainted, but not adjacent to the hollow). Hmm, this complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach of counting all the small cube faces in the shell and then subtracting the painted ones is better.\n\nEach small cube in the shell contributes 6 faces. Total small cubes:98, so 98 *6=588.\n\nThe painted faces are the ones on the exterior. The exterior has 6 faces, each 5x5=25. So 6*25=150 painted faces.\n\nSo the total unpainted faces would be 588-150=438.\n\nWait, but that's only considering the exterior. What about the faces that are adjacent to the hollow? Because those are also unpainted. Oh wait, because in the calculation above, the painted faces are 150, and the rest (588-150=438) include all the other faces, both the ones adjacent to the hollow and the ones adjacent to other small cubes.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the hollow's inner surfaces are not painted, so their adjacent faces are unpainted as well. So perhaps the initial approach is correct, but I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me think differently. The total number of small cube faces is 98*6=588.\n\nOf these, 150 are painted (on the outside).\n\nThe remaining 588-150=438 are unpainted.\n\nBut some of these unpainted faces are adjacent to the hollow, and others are adjacent to other small cubes.\n\nSo the answer is 438.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 438. So the answer would be A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Because in the shell, each small cube has some faces adjacent to other small cubes (unpainted) and some adjacent to the hollow (unpainted). So the 438 includes both.\n\nBut perhaps I should double-check.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nEach small cube in the shell has 6 faces. Some are on the exterior (painted), some are internal (unpainted), and some are adjacent to the hollow (unpainted).\n\nBut the total painted is 150. So the unpainted is 588-150=438.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a hollow cube, and I'm trying to figure out how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted after the outer surface is painted. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the cube is 5 cm in size, but it's hollow with a thickness of 1 cm. Oh wait, so the outer part is 5 cm on each side, but the inside is empty except for the walls. And each small cube is 1 cm in size. So the cube is made up of 5x5x5 small cubes, right? Let me calculate that: 5 cubed is 125. So there are 125 small cubes in total.\n\nBut wait, since the cube is hollow, the inner part is empty. So how many small cubes are actually present? The outer layer is 1 cm thick, so the inner dimensions would be (5-2) cm on each side, right? Because you subtract 1 cm from both sides. So inner cube is 3x3x3, which is 27 small cubes. So the hollow part is 27 cubes, meaning the total number of small cubes used is 125 - 27 = 98. Wait, is that correct? Because the hollow cube is 5 cm size, with 1 cm thickness, so the inner dimensions are 3x3x3. So yes, 98 small cubes are part of the hollow structure.\n\nBut wait, the question isn't about how many small cubes are there. It's about how many faces of the small cubes remain unpainted. The outer surface is painted, so any small cube on the surface will have some of its faces painted. The ones inside the hollow part won't have any painted faces, but wait, no, because the inner part is hollow\u2014so the inner surfaces aren't painted. But wait, the problem says the outer surface is painted, so only the outer faces are painted.\n\nWait, but the cube is hollow, so the small cubes on the inner surfaces are part of the structure. So their faces that are adjacent to the hollow (empty) space would not be painted. Because the paint is only on the outer surface.\n\nHmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me break it down.\n\nThe cube is 5x5x5, but it's hollow with 1 cm thickness. So the inner dimensions are 3x3x3, as I thought. So the outer layer is 5^3 = 125, inner is 3^3=27. So the hollow part is 27, so the number of small cubes in the structure is 125-27=98. So 98 small cubes are part of the cube's structure.\n\nEach of these small cubes can have 0 to 3 painted faces, depending on their position. The ones on the corners have 3 painted faces, edges (non-corner) have 2, and the faces (non-edge) have 1. The inner cubes (but wait, in this case, there are no inner cubes except the hollow part. The hollow is empty, so the cubes are only on the outer layer. So all the 98 cubes are on the outer layer, but some are on the edges or corners, etc.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if the cube is hollow, the inner 3x3x3 is empty. So the structure is the outer 1 cm layer. So each face of the cube is a 5x5 square of small cubes, but the inner part of each face is a 3x3. So the outer layer's face has (5x5) - (3x3) = 25-9=16 small cubes. But wait, that's for each face. Wait, no, because each face is 5x5, but the hollow is 3x3, so the number of small cubes on each face that are part of the structure is 5x5 - (5-2)x(5-2) = 25 -9=16. So each face has 16 cubes, but each cube is part of the structure, but some are on edges or corners.\n\nBut wait, the problem is about how many faces of the small cubes are unpainted. The outer surfaces are painted, so any face of a small cube that's on the outside is painted. The inner faces (those adjacent to the hollow) are not painted because the hollow is empty. So each small cube in the structure has some faces painted and some not.\n\nLet me think of each small cube's possible positions. Each cube can be on a corner, on an edge, on a face, or in the inner layer (but wait, the inner layer is hollow, so all the cubes are on the outer layer).\n\nWait, all the small cubes are on the outer layer because the inner part is empty. So each of the 98 small cubes is part of the outer structure.\n\nEach cube can be on a corner, edge, or face. Let's calculate how many have 3, 2, 1, or 0 painted faces.\n\nWait, no. The outer cubes: the ones on the corners have three painted faces, the ones on the edges (but not corners) have two painted faces, and the ones on the faces (but not edges) have one painted face. The ones inside the outer layer (but not on the outermost layer) would have zero painted faces on the outside, but wait, in our case, since the cube is hollow, these inner cubes of the outer layer are adjacent to the hollow. So their faces facing the hollow are not painted. But the outer faces of these inner cubes are part of the cube's outer surface and thus painted.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of each small cube's painted and unpainted faces.\n\nWait, the cube is hollow. So each small cube is on the outer layer (since the inner is empty). So each small cube is part of the structure, but may have some of their faces painted and some not.\n\nLet me think: Each small cube in the structure is on the outer face of the hollow cube. The cube is hollow, so the small cubes are arranged in a shell. Each small cube in this shell can have up to three painted faces (if it's a corner), or two (if on an edge), or one (if on a face), or maybe even no painted faces if it's on the inside of the shell.\n\nWait, wait, no. Because the shell is 1 cm thick. So the outer face is painted, but the inner face (the one next to the hollow) is not painted. So for each small cube in the shell, some of their faces are on the outside (painted), and some are on the inside (unpainted). But how many?\n\nWait, let's think of a single small cube in the structure. For example, a corner cube: it's at a corner of the larger cube. So it's part of three faces of the larger cube. So three of its faces are painted. The other three faces (the ones facing the hollow) are not painted. So each corner cube has three painted and three unpainted faces.\n\nAn edge cube (not a corner) is on an edge of the larger cube. It's part of two faces of the larger cube. So two of its faces are painted. The other four faces: wait, no. Each cube has six faces. Two are on the outside (the two faces of the larger cube), and the other four are internal. But in the case of the hollow cube, each small cube is in the shell. So for an edge cube, four of its faces are adjacent to other small cubes (the shell's structure), and two are on the outside. So the two outside faces are painted, the four inside are not. Wait, no, no, because in the shell, each cube is surrounded by other cubes except on the outside. So each cube's faces that are on the outside are painted. The ones facing into the structure or the hollow are not.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to think about each small cube in the shell and count the number of painted and unpainted faces.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to calculate the total number of small cube faces in the entire structure, then subtract the number of painted faces.\n\nWait, each small cube has 6 faces. The total number of small cube faces is 98 *6 = 588.\n\nBut some of these faces are internal (between cubes) and some are external (painted or facing the hollow).\n\nThe total number of painted faces is the surface area of the cube. The cube is 5x5x5, so surface area is 6*(5x5) = 150. But wait, each face is 5x5 squares, each square being a 1x1 cm face. So each face has 25 small cube faces. So 6 faces *25 =150 painted faces.\n\nWait, but the cube is hollow. So the inner surfaces (the hollow) are not painted. So the total painted faces are 150, as the outer surfaces are painted.\n\nNow, the total number of small cube faces is 588. Of these, 150 are painted. The remaining are either unpainted or internal.\n\nBut wait, the internal faces are those between small cubes. So each internal face is shared between two small cubes. So the number of internal faces is (total faces - painted faces)/2. Because each internal face is counted twice (once for each cube it's attached to).\n\nWait, let's think again. Each internal face is between two small cubes. So if there are N internal faces, each contributes 2 to the total face count (once for each cube). So the total number of internal faces is (588 - 150) / 2 = (438)/2 =219.\n\nBut the question is about the number of faces that remain unpainted. So the unpainted faces are the ones that are not painted and not internal. Wait, no. The unpainted faces are the ones that are not painted. So that includes both the internal faces (facing other cubes) and the faces that are on the inner side, facing the hollow.\n\nWait, no. The inner side of the hollow isn't part of the structure's cubes. So each cube in the shell has some faces on the outside (painted) and some on the inside (unpainted). Because the hollow is empty, the small cubes' faces that are adjacent to the hollow are not painted.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to count for each small cube, how many of their faces are unpainted. Then sum all those.\n\nSo for each small cube in the structure, the number of unpainted faces is equal to the number of their faces that are not on the outside (so not painted) and not adjacent to another small cube.\n\nWait, no. Because for a hollow cube, each small cube in the shell has some faces on the outside (painted) and some faces that are adjacent to the hollow (unpainted), and others adjacent to other small cubes (so internal, but not painted either because they're internal, but the adjacent cube's face is internal as well).\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think of each small cube as having some faces on the outside (painted), some faces on the inside (facing the hollow, unpainted), and some faces adjacent to other small cubes (also unpainted, but those are internal).\n\nSo for each small cube in the shell, the number of unpainted faces is:\n\nTotal faces (6) minus the number of painted faces (which depends on position) minus the number of faces adjacent to other cubes (which is variable).\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternative approach: Each small cube can contribute to the painted and unpainted faces.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute the total number of unpainted faces by considering the structure.\n\nWait, the hollow cube's structure is the outer 1 cm layer. Each small cube in this layer has some number of painted faces (on the outside) and some number of unpainted faces.\n\nEach unpainted face is either on the inner side (facing the hollow) or on the inner part of the shell (facing another cube in the shell). So each unpainted face is either internal (facing another cube) or facing the hollow.\n\nBut how do we calculate the total number of unpainted faces?\n\nWait, the total number of small cube faces is 98 *6 = 588.\n\nThe number of painted faces is 5x5x6 = 150.\n\nSo the number of unpainted faces is 588 -150 = 438. But wait, that would be the total unpainted faces, including both the inner faces of the shell and the faces adjacent to the hollow.\n\nBut wait, no, because the faces adjacent to the hollow are also unpainted. So in the hollow cube, the small cubes have some of their faces on the hollow side (unpainted), and others on the outside (painted). Also, each cube has faces that are adjacent to other cubes in the shell (so those are internal and unpainted).\n\nSo the total unpainted faces would be 588-150=438. But is that the case?\n\nWait, let me think again. The 150 painted faces are the outer surfaces. The other 588-150=438 are the unpainted ones. But are all of these 438 unpainted? Because the faces adjacent to the hollow are also unpainted, as well as the internal faces between cubes in the shell.\n\nBut wait, in a solid cube (without hollow), the internal faces would be the ones between cubes. But in a hollow cube, the internal faces are either between cubes in the shell or facing the hollow.\n\nSo, in a hollow cube, each small cube has:\n\n- Some faces on the outside (painted).\n- Some faces on the inside (facing hollow, unpainted).\n- Some faces adjacent to other small cubes in the shell (unpainted).\n\nSo the total number of unpainted faces is indeed 438, but the question is about how many of the small cube's faces are unpainted. So the answer would be 438.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 438, which would be the answer. But wait, another approach: each small cube in the shell has some number of unpainted faces.\n\nWait, for each cube in the shell, the number of unpainted faces is 6 minus the number of painted faces. The painted faces vary depending on whether the cube is on a corner, edge, or face.\n\nSo let's calculate the number of cubes in each category and the number of unpainted faces each contributes.\n\nTotal small cubes:98.\n\nCubes can be in four categories:\n\n1. Corner cubes: each has 3 painted faces.\n\nHow many? A cube has 8 corners. Each corner cube is part of the structure, so 8 cubes.\n\nEach contributes 6-3=3 unpainted faces.\n\nSo 8 *3=24.\n\n2. Edge cubes (excluding corners): each has 2 painted faces.\n\nEach edge of the cube is 5 cm, so the number of small cubes along an edge is 5. But since the cube is hollow, the inner 3 cm is hollow, so the edge has 5-2=3 cubes on each edge, but two are corners. So for each edge, the non-corner cubes are 3-2=1? Wait, wait, perhaps I should think differently.\n\nWait, the outer layer is 1 cm thick. So each edge has 5 small cubes (since each edge is 5 cm). But the two at the ends are corners. So the number of edge cubes (excluding corners) per edge is 5-2=3. But wait, no: the 5 cm edge is made of 5 small cubes each 1 cm. So the two end cubes are corners, and the remaining three are edge cubes. But wait, wait, 5 cubes in a row: positions 1,2,3,4,5. Positions 1 and 5 are corners. So positions 2,3,4 are edge cubes (non-corner). So each edge has 3 such cubes.\n\nThere are 12 edges in a cube. So 12 edges * 3 cubes per edge=36 edge cubes.\n\nEach edge cube has 2 painted faces.\n\nSo each contributes 6-2=4 unpainted faces.\n\nSo 36 *4=144.\n\n3. Face cubes (excluding edges): these are the cubes on each face but not on the edges.\n\nEach face is 5x5=25 cubes. Subtract the outermost layer (edges) to get the face center cubes.\n\nEach face has a 3x3=9 cubes in the center that are not on the edges. Because the outermost layer (edges) includes the perimeter: the first and fifth rows and columns.\n\nSo each face has 25 - (perimeter) =25 - (4*(5-1)) =25-16=9. Wait, 5x5 is 25. The perimeter is 4*(5-1) =16. So 25-16=9. So each face has 9 face center cubes.\n\nBut wait, in the hollow cube, these face center cubes are part of the structure.\n\nWait, no. Because the cube is hollow, the inner 3x3x3 is empty. So each face has a 5x5 grid, but the inner 3x3 is empty. So the face center cubes are the ones that are on the outer face but not on the edges.\n\nSo each face has (5-2)*(5-2)=3x3=9 face center cubes.\n\nBut wait, each face of the cube is 5x5, but the structure's face is 5x5, minus the inner 3x3. So the face structure is 5x5 -3x3=25-9=16 cubes per face.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nEach face of the hollow cube has 5x5=25 small cubes. But the inner part (3x3) is empty. So the number of small cubes on each face is 5x5 -3x3=16. These 16 cubes are arranged in a frame. So the 16 cubes include the perimeter.\n\nWait, no, 5x5 grid, inner 3x3 is hollow. So the cubes on each face are 16, which form a frame around the hollow.\n\nSo for each face, the 16 cubes are arranged as the perimeter of a 5x5 square. So how many of them are on the edges of the face (i.e., the outer edges of the cube) and how many are internal?\n\nWait, the perimeter of a 5x5 square has 4*(5-1) =16 cubes. So each face has 16 perimeter cubes, which are the ones on the edges of the face.\n\nWait, but the face is 5x5, and the inner 3x3 is hollow. So the 16 cubes on each face are all on the edges of the face, meaning that they are on the edges of the larger cube as well.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe an alternative approach is better.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the number of face, edge, and corner cubes in the entire structure.\n\nThe structure is a hollow cube, 5x5x5, with 1 cm thickness. So the structure is a shell of 1 cm thickness.\n\nIn a cube, the number of corner cubes is 8 (as usual).\n\nEach edge of the cube has length 5, but the hollow is 3x3x3. So the outer layer is 1 cm thick. So each edge has 5 small cubes, but the two at each end are corners. The remaining three are edge cubes (excluding corners). So 12 edges * (5-2) =36 edge cubes (non-corner).\n\nThen, the face centers: each face has (5-2)*(5-2) =3x3=9 cubes that are on the face but not on the edges. So 6 faces *9=54 face center cubes.\n\nSo total cubes: 8 (corners) +36 (edges) +54 (face centers) =98. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nNow, each corner cube has 3 painted faces.\n\nEach edge cube (non-corner) has 2 painted faces.\n\nEach face center cube has 1 painted face.\n\nSo the number of unpainted faces for each type:\n\n- Corner cubes: each has 3 painted faces. So 6-3=3 unpainted. 8 *3=24.\n\n- Edge cubes: 2 painted, 6-2=4 unpainted. 36 *4=144.\n\n- Face centers: 1 painted, 6-1=5 unpainted. 54 *5=270.\n\nTotal unpainted faces: 24 +144 +270= 438.\n\nSo the answer is 438, which is option A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the hollow cube of size 5 cm (outer dimensions) and thickness 1 cm.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about a hollow cube, and I'm trying to figure out how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted after the outer surface is painted. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the cube is 5 cm in size, but it's hollow with a thickness of 1 cm. Oh wait, so the outer part is 5 cm on each side, but the inside is empty except for the walls. And each small cube is 1 cm in size. So the cube is made up of 5x5x5 small cubes, right? Let me calculate that: 5 cubed is 125. So there are 125 small cubes in total.\n\nBut wait, since the cube is hollow, the inner part is empty. So how many small cubes are actually present? The outer layer is 1 cm thick, so the inner dimensions would be (5-2) cm on each side, right? Because you subtract 1 cm from both sides. So inner cube is 3x3x3, which is 27 small cubes. So the hollow part is 27 cubes, meaning the total number of small cubes used is 125 - 27 = 98. Wait, is that correct? Because the hollow cube is 5 cm size, with 1 cm thickness, so the inner dimensions are 3x3x3. So yes, 98 small cubes are part of the hollow structure.\n\nBut wait, the question isn't about how many small cubes are there. It's about how many faces of the small cubes remain unpainted. The outer surface is painted, so any small cube on the surface will have some of its faces painted. The ones inside the hollow part won't have any painted faces, but wait, no, because the inner part is hollow\u2014so the inner surfaces aren't painted. But wait, the problem says the outer surface is painted, so only the outer faces are painted.\n\nWait, but the cube is hollow, so the small cubes on the inner surfaces are part of the structure. So their faces that are adjacent to the hollow (empty) space would not be painted. Because the paint is only on the outer surface.\n\nHmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me break it down.\n\nThe cube is 5x5x5, but it's hollow with 1 cm thickness. So the inner dimensions are 3x3x3, as I thought. So the outer layer is 5^3 = 125, inner is 3^3=27. So the hollow part is 27, so the number of small cubes in the structure is 125-27=98. So 98 small cubes are part of the cube's structure.\n\nEach of these small cubes can have 0 to 3 painted faces, depending on their position. The ones on the corners have 3 painted faces, edges (non-corner) have 2, and the faces (non-edge) have 1. The inner cubes (but wait, in this case, there are no inner cubes except the hollow part. The hollow is empty, so the cubes are only on the outer layer. So all the 98 cubes are on the outer layer, but some are on the edges or corners, etc.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if the cube is hollow, the inner 3x3x3 is empty. So the structure is the outer 1 cm layer. So each face of the cube is a 5x5 square of small cubes, but the inner part of each face is a 3x3. So the outer layer's face has (5x5) - (3x3) = 25-9=16 small cubes. But wait, that's for each face. Wait, no, because each face is 5x5, but the hollow is 3x3, so the number of small cubes on each face that are part of the structure is 5x5 - (5-2)x(5-2) = 25 -9=16. So each face has 16 cubes, but each cube is part of the structure, but some are on edges or corners.\n\nBut wait, the problem is about how many faces of the small cubes are unpainted. The outer surfaces are painted, so any face of a small cube that's on the outside is painted. The inner faces (those adjacent to the hollow) are not painted because the hollow is empty. So each small cube in the structure has some faces painted and some not.\n\nLet me think of each small cube's possible positions. Each cube can be on a corner, on an edge, on a face, or in the inner layer (but wait, the inner layer is hollow, so all the cubes are on the outer layer).\n\nWait, all the small cubes are on the outer layer because the inner part is empty. So each of the 98 small cubes is part of the outer structure.\n\nEach cube can be on a corner, edge, or face. Let's calculate how many have 3, 2, 1, or 0 painted faces.\n\nWait, no. The outer cubes: the ones on the corners have three painted faces, the ones on the edges (but not corners) have two painted faces, and the ones on the faces (but not edges) have one painted face. The ones inside the outer layer (but not on the outermost layer) would have zero painted faces on the outside, but wait, in our case, since the cube is hollow, these inner cubes of the outer layer are adjacent to the hollow. So their faces facing the hollow are not painted. But the outer faces of these inner cubes are part of the cube's outer surface and thus painted.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of each small cube's painted and unpainted faces.\n\nWait, the cube is hollow. So each small cube is on the outer layer (since the inner is empty). So each small cube is part of the structure, but may have some of their faces painted and some not.\n\nLet me think: Each small cube in the structure is on the outer face of the hollow cube. The cube is hollow, so the small cubes are arranged in a shell. Each small cube in this shell can have up to three painted faces (if it's a corner), or two (if on an edge), or one (if on a face), or maybe even no painted faces if it's on the inside of the shell.\n\nWait, wait, no. Because the shell is 1 cm thick. So the outer face is painted, but the inner face (the one next to the hollow) is not painted. So for each small cube in the shell, some of their faces are on the outside (painted), and some are on the inside (unpainted). But how many?\n\nWait, let's think of a single small cube in the structure. For example, a corner cube: it's at a corner of the larger cube. So it's part of three faces of the larger cube. So three of its faces are painted. The other three faces (the ones facing the hollow) are not painted. So each corner cube has three painted and three unpainted faces.\n\nAn edge cube (not a corner) is on an edge of the larger cube. It's part of two faces of the larger cube. So two of its faces are painted. The other four faces: wait, no. Each cube has six faces. Two are on the outside (the two faces of the larger cube), and the other four are internal. But in the case of the hollow cube, each small cube is in the shell. So for an edge cube, four of its faces are adjacent to other small cubes (the shell's structure), and two are on the outside. So the two outside faces are painted, the four inside are not. Wait, no, no, because in the shell, each cube is surrounded by other cubes except on the outside. So each cube's faces that are on the outside are painted. The ones facing into the structure or the hollow are not.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to think about each small cube in the shell and count the number of painted and unpainted faces.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to calculate the total number of small cube faces in the entire structure, then subtract the number of painted faces.\n\nWait, each small cube has 6 faces. The total number of small cube faces is 98 *6 = 588.\n\nBut some of these faces are internal (between cubes) and some are external (painted or facing the hollow).\n\nThe total number of painted faces is the surface area of the cube. The cube is 5x5x5, so surface area is 6*(5x5) = 150. But wait, each face is 5x5 squares, each square being a 1x1 cm face. So each face has 25 small cube faces. So 6 faces *25 =150 painted faces.\n\nWait, but the cube is hollow. So the inner surfaces (the hollow) are not painted. So the total painted faces are 150, as the outer surfaces are painted.\n\nNow, the total number of small cube faces is 588. Of these, 150 are painted. The remaining are either unpainted or internal.\n\nBut wait, the internal faces are those between small cubes. So each internal face is shared between two small cubes. So the number of internal faces is (total faces - painted faces)/2. Because each internal face is counted twice (once for each cube it's attached to).\n\nWait, let's think again. Each internal face is between two small cubes. So if there are N internal faces, each contributes 2 to the total face count (once for each cube). So the total number of internal faces is (588 - 150) / 2 = (438)/2 =219.\n\nBut the question is about the number of faces that remain unpainted. So the unpainted faces are the ones that are not painted and not internal. Wait, no. The unpainted faces are the ones that are not painted. So that includes both the internal faces (facing other cubes) and the faces that are on the inner side, facing the hollow.\n\nWait, no. The inner side of the hollow isn't part of the structure's cubes. So each cube in the shell has some faces on the outside (painted) and some on the inside (unpainted). Because the hollow is empty, the small cubes' faces that are adjacent to the hollow are not painted.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to count for each small cube, how many of their faces are unpainted. Then sum all those.\n\nSo for each small cube in the structure, the number of unpainted faces is equal to the number of their faces that are not on the outside (so not painted) and not adjacent to another small cube.\n\nWait, no. Because for a hollow cube, each small cube in the shell has some faces on the outside (painted) and some faces that are adjacent to the hollow (unpainted), and others adjacent to other small cubes (so internal, but not painted either because they're internal, but the adjacent cube's face is internal as well).\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think of each small cube as having some faces on the outside (painted), some faces on the inside (facing the hollow, unpainted), and some faces adjacent to other small cubes (also unpainted, but those are internal).\n\nSo for each small cube in the shell, the number of unpainted faces is:\n\nTotal faces (6) minus the number of painted faces (which depends on position) minus the number of faces adjacent to other cubes (which is variable).\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternative approach: Each small cube can contribute to the painted and unpainted faces.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute the total number of unpainted faces by considering the structure.\n\nWait, the hollow cube's structure is the outer 1 cm layer. Each small cube in this layer has some number of painted faces (on the outside) and some number of unpainted faces.\n\nEach unpainted face is either on the inner side (facing the hollow) or on the inner part of the shell (facing another cube in the shell). So each unpainted face is either internal (facing another cube) or facing the hollow.\n\nBut how do we calculate the total number of unpainted faces?\n\nWait, the total number of small cube faces is 98 *6 = 588.\n\nThe number of painted faces is 5x5x6 = 150.\n\nSo the number of unpainted faces is 588 -150 = 438. But wait, that would be the total unpainted faces, including both the inner faces of the shell and the faces adjacent to the hollow.\n\nBut wait, no, because the faces adjacent to the hollow are also unpainted. So in the hollow cube, the small cubes have some of their faces on the hollow side (unpainted), and others on the outside (painted). Also, each cube has faces that are adjacent to other cubes in the shell (so those are internal and unpainted).\n\nSo the total unpainted faces would be 588-150=438. But is that the case?\n\nWait, let me think again. The 150 painted faces are the outer surfaces. The other 588-150=438 are the unpainted ones. But are all of these 438 unpainted? Because the faces adjacent to the hollow are also unpainted, as well as the internal faces between cubes in the shell.\n\nBut wait, in a solid cube (without hollow), the internal faces would be the ones between cubes. But in a hollow cube, the internal faces are either between cubes in the shell or facing the hollow.\n\nSo, in a hollow cube, each small cube has:\n\n- Some faces on the outside (painted).\n- Some faces on the inside (facing hollow, unpainted).\n- Some faces adjacent to other small cubes in the shell (unpainted).\n\nSo the total number of unpainted faces is indeed 438, but the question is about how many of the small cube's faces are unpainted. So the answer would be 438.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 438, which would be the answer. But wait, another approach: each small cube in the shell has some number of unpainted faces.\n\nWait, for each cube in the shell, the number of unpainted faces is 6 minus the number of painted faces. The painted faces vary depending on whether the cube is on a corner, edge, or face.\n\nSo let's calculate the number of cubes in each category and the number of unpainted faces each contributes.\n\nTotal small cubes:98.\n\nCubes can be in four categories:\n\n1. Corner cubes: each has 3 painted faces.\n\nHow many? A cube has 8 corners. Each corner cube is part of the structure, so 8 cubes.\n\nEach contributes 6-3=3 unpainted faces.\n\nSo 8 *3=24.\n\n2. Edge cubes (excluding corners): each has 2 painted faces.\n\nEach edge of the cube is 5 cm, so the number of small cubes along an edge is 5. But since the cube is hollow, the inner 3 cm is hollow, so the edge has 5-2=3 cubes on each edge, but two are corners. So for each edge, the non-corner cubes are 3-2=1? Wait, wait, perhaps I should think differently.\n\nWait, the outer layer is 1 cm thick. So each edge has 5 small cubes (since each edge is 5 cm). But the two at the ends are corners. So the number of edge cubes (excluding corners) per edge is 5-2=3. But wait, no: the 5 cm edge is made of 5 small cubes each 1 cm. So the two end cubes are corners, and the remaining three are edge cubes. But wait, wait, 5 cubes in a row: positions 1,2,3,4,5. Positions 1 and 5 are corners. So positions 2,3,4 are edge cubes (non-corner). So each edge has 3 such cubes.\n\nThere are 12 edges in a cube. So 12 edges * 3 cubes per edge=36 edge cubes.\n\nEach edge cube has 2 painted faces.\n\nSo each contributes 6-2=4 unpainted faces.\n\nSo 36 *4=144.\n\n3. Face cubes (excluding edges): these are the cubes on each face but not on the edges.\n\nEach face is 5x5=25 cubes. Subtract the outermost layer (edges) to get the face center cubes.\n\nEach face has a 3x3=9 cubes in the center that are not on the edges. Because the outermost layer (edges) includes the perimeter: the first and fifth rows and columns.\n\nSo each face has 25 - (perimeter) =25 - (4*(5-1)) =25-16=9. Wait, 5x5 is 25. The perimeter is 4*(5-1) =16. So 25-16=9. So each face has 9 face center cubes.\n\nBut wait, in the hollow cube, these face center cubes are part of the structure.\n\nWait, no. Because the cube is hollow, the inner 3x3x3 is empty. So each face has a 5x5 grid, but the inner 3x3 is empty. So the face center cubes are the ones that are on the outer face but not on the edges.\n\nSo each face has (5-2)*(5-2)=3x3=9 face center cubes.\n\nBut wait, each face of the cube is 5x5, but the structure's face is 5x5, minus the inner 3x3. So the face structure is 5x5 -3x3=25-9=16 cubes per face.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nEach face of the hollow cube has 5x5=25 small cubes. But the inner part (3x3) is empty. So the number of small cubes on each face is 5x5 -3x3=16. These 16 cubes are arranged in a frame. So the 16 cubes include the perimeter.\n\nWait, no, 5x5 grid, inner 3x3 is hollow. So the cubes on each face are 16, which form a frame around the hollow.\n\nSo for each face, the 16 cubes are arranged as the perimeter of a 5x5 square. So how many of them are on the edges of the face (i.e., the outer edges of the cube) and how many are internal?\n\nWait, the perimeter of a 5x5 square has 4*(5-1) =16 cubes. So each face has 16 perimeter cubes, which are the ones on the edges of the face.\n\nWait, but the face is 5x5, and the inner 3x3 is hollow. So the 16 cubes on each face are all on the edges of the face, meaning that they are on the edges of the larger cube as well.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe an alternative approach is better.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the number of face, edge, and corner cubes in the entire structure.\n\nThe structure is a hollow cube, 5x5x5, with 1 cm thickness. So the structure is a shell of 1 cm thickness.\n\nIn a cube, the number of corner cubes is 8 (as usual).\n\nEach edge of the cube has length 5, but the hollow is 3x3x3. So the outer layer is 1 cm thick. So each edge has 5 small cubes, but the two at each end are corners. The remaining three are edge cubes (excluding corners). So 12 edges * (5-2) =36 edge cubes (non-corner).\n\nThen, the face centers: each face has (5-2)*(5-2) =3x3=9 cubes that are on the face but not on the edges. So 6 faces *9=54 face center cubes.\n\nSo total cubes: 8 (corners) +36 (edges) +54 (face centers) =98. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nNow, each corner cube has 3 painted faces.\n\nEach edge cube (non-corner) has 2 painted faces.\n\nEach face center cube has 1 painted face.\n\nSo the number of unpainted faces for each type:\n\n- Corner cubes: each has 3 painted faces. So 6-3=3 unpainted. 8 *3=24.\n\n- Edge cubes: 2 painted, 6-2=4 unpainted. 36 *4=144.\n\n- Face centers: 1 painted, 6-1=5 unpainted. 54 *5=270.\n\nTotal unpainted faces: 24 +144 +270= 438.\n\nSo the answer is 438, which is option A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the hollow cube of size 5 cm (outer dimensions) and thickness 1 cm. The cube is made of 1 cm\u00b3 smaller cubes, and the outer surface is painted. The goal is to determine how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n\n1. **Total Small Cubes in the Hollow Cube**:\n   - The outer dimensions of the cube are 5 cm on each side, so the total number of small cubes is \\( 5^3 = 125 \\).\n   - The inner dimensions are reduced by 2 cm on each side (due to the 1 cm thickness), giving inner dimensions of \\( 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\), which contains \\( 3^3 = 27 \\) small cubes.\n   - The hollow part is empty, so the number of small cubes in the structure is \\( 125 - 27 = 98 \\).\n\n2. **Categories of Small Cubes in the Structure**:\n   - **Corner Cubes**: A cube has 8 corners. Each corner cube has 3 painted faces (on the outside) and 3 unpainted faces (facing the hollow or adjacent to other cubes).\n     - Contribution to unpainted faces: \\( 8 \\times 3 = 24 \\).\n   - **Edge Cubes (Non-Corner)**: Each edge of the cube has 5 small cubes, but the 2 at the ends are corners. Thus, there are \\( 5 - 2 = 3 \\) non-corner edge cubes per edge. With 12 edges, there are \\( 12 \\times 3 = 36 \\) edge cubes.\n     - Each edge cube has 2 painted faces and 4 unpainted faces.\n     - Contribution to unpainted faces: \\( 36 \\times 4 = 144 \\).\n   - **Face Center Cubes**: Each face of the cube has \\( 5 \\times 5 = 25 \\) small cubes. Excluding the edges, the center of each face has \\( (5 - 2) \\times (5 - 2) = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\) small cubes.\n     - With 6 faces, there are \\( 6 \\times 9 = 54 \\) face center cubes.\n     - Each face center cube has 1 painted face and 5 unpainted faces.\n     - Contribution to unpainted faces: \\( 54 \\times 5 = 270 \\).\n\n3. **Total Unpainted Faces**:\n   - Adding the contributions from all categories:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total unpainted faces} = 24 + 144 + 270 = 438\n     \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe total number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is **438**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a hollow cube, and I need to figure out how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted after the outer surface is painted. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, the cube is 5 cm in size, but the thickness is 1 cm. So wait, I think that means each edge is 5 cm long, but the walls of the cube are 1 cm thick. So it's like a box made of smaller cubes. Each small cube is 1 cm in size, right? So the entire cube is made up of these 1 cm\u00b3 smaller cubes.\n\nWait, the cube is hollow, so only the outer layer is there, and the inside is empty. So the total number of small cubes used to make the hollow cube would be the total number of cubes in a 5x5x5 cube minus the inner part that's hollow. Since the thickness is 1 cm, the hollow part would be a 3x3x3 cube inside. Because 5 minus 2*1 (the two walls) equals 3. So 5^3 is 125, and 3^3 is 27. So the total small cubes are 125 -27=98 cubes. But wait, that's the total number of small cubes in the hollow cube.\n\nWait, but the question is about the faces that remain unpainted. The outer surface is painted, so any small cube on the surface will have some painted faces, and the ones inside won't be painted at all. But wait, no, because the cube is hollow, so the inner part is empty. So the only small cubes are on the outer layer, but the inside is just air.\n\nWait, wait, no, the cube is made of smaller cubes, but it's hollow, meaning that the inside isn't filled with cubes. So the structure is just the outer shell, made of 1 cm thick walls. So each face of the cube is a 5x5 square, but only the outermost layer is part of the cube.\n\nSo, each face of the big cube has (5)^2 =25 small cubes. But wait, since the cube is hollow, the inner part is empty. So for each face, the outer layer is part of the structure, but the inner part (like the 3x3 in the center of each face) is actually empty. So each face of the big cube is made up of 5x5=25 small cubes, but only the outermost layer on that face is part of the structure. Wait, no. Because the cube is 5 cm on each edge, but the thickness is 1 cm. So each face of the big cube is 5x5 cm, but the actual structure is 1 cm thick. So each face of the big cube is a 5x5 grid of small cubes, but only the ones on the outer layer of the big cube are present. So for each face, the small cubes are arranged as a 5x5 grid, but the inner 3x3 is empty. So each face has (5^2 -3^2)=25-9=16 small cubes. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the thickness is 1 cm, each face's structure is a 5x5 grid, but only the perimeter is present. So for each face, the outermost layer is 5x5, but how many cubes are on each face? Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the hollow cube as a 5x5x5 cube where only the outer layer is present. So the number of small cubes is 5^3 - (5-2*1)^3 = 125 - 3^3 = 125 -27=98. So there are 98 small cubes in the hollow structure.\n\nEach of these small cubes is on the surface of the big cube, so each has some faces exposed. When the outer surface is painted, any face that's on the exterior of the big cube gets painted. The question is, how many faces of all the small cubes remain unpainted.\n\nWait, no. Each small cube can have multiple faces exposed. For example, a corner cube would have three faces exposed. An edge cube (not a corner) would have two faces exposed. A face cube (not on an edge) would have one face exposed. And the ones inside the hollow part have zero faces exposed, but since the cube is hollow, there are no such cubes. So all the small cubes in the hollow cube are on the exterior, each with at least one face exposed.\n\nSo the total number of small cube faces is each cube's faces, but each cube has 6 faces. However, the ones on the exterior have some of their faces painted. The problem is to find the total number of faces that are not painted, i.e., the sum of all the unpainted faces of all the small cubes.\n\nWait, that's a bit tricky. Because each small cube has some faces that are on the outside (so they're painted) and some that are on the inside (unpainted, but since it's hollow, maybe some of them are adjacent to the hollow interior, which is air. So those faces wouldn't be painted either.\n\nWait, no. The cube is hollow, so the inner surfaces are not exposed to the outside. So when you paint only the outer surfaces, the inner surfaces (the ones facing the hollow) remain unpainted.\n\nSo each small cube on the exterior has some of their faces painted (the ones on the outside) and the others are either adjacent to another cube or to the hollow interior.\n\nWait, but in a hollow cube, the inner surfaces of the walls are the ones that face the hollow. So each small cube in the wall has some faces on the outside (painted) and some on the inside (unpainted). Plus, they might be adjacent to other cubes, but those would be on the same face, so those would not be painted either.\n\nHmm, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the total number of faces of all the small cubes, and subtract the number of painted faces. Because the painted faces are only the outer surfaces of the big cube.\n\nWait, let me think about this. Each small cube has 6 faces. The total number of small cubes is 98. So the total number of small cube faces is 98 * 6 = 588.\n\nNow, the number of painted faces is the number of outer faces of the big cube. Each face of the big cube is 5x5=25 small cube faces. The cube has 6 faces, so the total painted faces are 6 *25 =150.\n\nSo the unpainted faces would be total faces minus painted faces: 588 -150=438. Hmm, but wait, I'm not sure. Because each small cube in the hollow may have inner faces that are adjacent to the hollow. But wait, the hollow is empty, so those inner faces are not painted. So all the small cube's faces that are not on the outer surface are unpainted. So in this approach, all the unpainted faces are the inner ones plus any internal faces where two small cubes are adjacent.\n\nWait, but when two small cubes are adjacent, their touching faces are not part of the exterior. So those faces are also unpainted.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to compute the total number of faces of all small cubes (588), subtract the number of painted faces (150). Because the unpainted faces include both the internal faces (where two small cubes meet) and the faces that are on the inner side of the hollow (facing the empty space).\n\nWait, but the inner side of the hollow: each small cube in the hollow's wall has some faces that are part of the hollow's inner surface. So each such face is not painted because it's not on the outer surface.\n\nSo let me think: the total number of small cube faces is 588. The painted ones are 150. So the unpainted would be 588 -150=438. So the answer would be 438, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe there's another approach. Another way to think is to calculate for each small cube, how many of its faces are unpainted.\n\nEach small cube is part of the hollow cube, so it's on the exterior. Let's consider the position of each cube:\n\n1. Corner cubes: Each has 3 faces on the exterior, painted. The other 3 faces are either adjacent to other cubes or the hollow. So unpainted faces: 3.\n\nWait, no, if a corner cube is part of the hollow, then on the other side of each face, it could be either another cube or the hollow.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the hollow cube as a shell. The shell has an outer surface and an inner surface, but since it's hollow, the inner surface is the inner faces of the shell's cubes.\n\nEach small cube in the shell has some outer faces (painted) and some inner faces (unpainted). Also, each cube may have some adjacent cubes on other faces, which would have their faces adjacent to each other, so those are also unpainted.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the number of unpainted faces as follows:\n\nThe total number of small cube faces is 98 *6 =588.\n\nThe number of painted faces is the area of the outer surface: 6 faces, each 5x5=25. So 6*25=150.\n\nThe unpainted faces are 588-150=438.\n\nSo the answer is 438, which is option A.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought about the inner faces and the adjacent faces. But according to this calculation, the unpainted is 438, which matches option A.\n\nBut let me think again. Another approach: each small cube in the shell has 6 faces. For each cube, the number of painted faces is the number of faces on the exterior. The number of unpainted faces is 6 minus the number of painted faces.\n\nSo for each cube, the number of unpainted faces is 6 - (number of exterior faces it has).\n\nSo the total unpainted faces would be sum over all cubes of (6 - painted_faces).\n\nSo sum of all painted_faces is 150, as before. The sum of 6 for each cube is 98*6=588.\n\nSo total unpainted = 588 -150=438.\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nSo the correct answer is A)438.\n",

So the entire cube is made up of these 1 cm\u00b3 smaller cubes.\n\nWait, the cube is hollow, so only the outer layer is there, and the inside is empty. So the total number of small cubes used to make the hollow cube would be the total number of cubes in a 5x5x5 cube minus the inner part that's hollow. Since the thickness is 1 cm, the hollow part would be a 3x3x3 cube inside. Because 5 minus 2*1 (the two walls) equals 3. So 5^3 is 125, and 3^3 is 27. So the total small cubes are 125 -27=98 cubes. But wait, that's the total number of small cubes in the hollow cube.\n\nWait, but the question is about the faces that remain unpainted.

But wait, since the cube is hollow, the inner part is empty.

Because the cube is 5 cm on each edge, but the thickness is 1 cm. So each face of the big cube is 5x5 cm, but the actual structure is 1 cm thick. So each face of the big cube is a 5x5 grid of small cubes, but only the ones on the outer layer of the big cube are present. So for each face, the small cubes are arranged as a 5x5 grid, but the inner 3x3 is empty. So each face has (5^2 -3^2)=25-9=16 small cubes. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the thickness is 1 cm, each face's structure is a 5x5 grid, but only the perimeter is present. So for each face, the outermost layer is 5x5, but how many cubes are on each face? Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the hollow cube as a 5x5x5 cube where only the outer layer is present. So the number of small cubes is 5^3 - (5-2*1)^3 = 125 - 3^3 = 125 -27=98.

So those faces wouldn't be painted either.\n\nWait, no. The cube is hollow, so the inner surfaces are not exposed to the outside. So when you paint only the outer surfaces, the inner surfaces (the ones facing the hollow) remain unpainted.\n\nSo each small cube on the exterior has some of their faces painted (the ones on the outside) and the others are either adjacent to another cube or to the hollow interior.\n\nWait, but in a hollow cube, the inner surfaces of the walls are the ones that face the hollow. So each small cube in the wall has some faces on the outside (painted) and some on the inside (unpainted). Plus, they might be adjacent to other cubes, but those would be on the same face, so those would not be painted either.\n\nHmm, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the total number of faces of all the small cubes, and subtract the number of painted faces. Because the painted faces are only the outer surfaces of the big cube.\n\nWait, let me think about this. Each small cube has 6 faces. The total number of small cubes is 98. So the total number of small cube faces is 98 * 6 = 588.\n\nNow, the number of painted faces is the number of outer faces of the big cube. Each face of the big cube is 5x5=25 small cube faces. The cube has 6 faces, so the total painted faces are 6 *25 =150.\n\nSo the unpainted faces would be total faces minus painted faces: 588 -150=438. Hmm, but wait, I'm not sure. Because each small cube in the hollow may have inner faces that are adjacent to the hollow. But wait, the hollow is empty, so those inner faces are not painted. So all the small cube's faces that are not on the outer surface are unpainted. So in this approach, all the unpainted faces are the inner ones plus any internal faces where two small cubes are adjacent.\n\nWait, but when two small cubes are adjacent, their touching faces are not part of the exterior. So those faces are also unpainted.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to compute the total number of faces of all small cubes (588), subtract the number of painted faces (150). Because the unpainted faces include both the internal faces (where two small cubes meet) and the faces that are on the inner side of the hollow (facing the empty space).\n\nWait, but the inner side of the hollow: each small cube in the hollow's wall has some faces that are part of the hollow's inner surface. So each such face is not painted because it's not on the outer surface.\n\nSo let me think: the total number of small cube faces is 588. The painted ones are 150. So the unpainted would be 588 -150=438. So the answer would be 438, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe there's another approach. Another way to think is to calculate for each small cube, how many of its faces are unpainted.\n\nEach small cube is part of the hollow cube, so it's on the exterior. Let's consider the position of each cube:\n\n1. Corner cubes: Each has 3 faces on the exterior, painted. The other 3 faces are either adjacent to other cubes or the hollow. So unpainted faces: 3.\n\nWait, no, if a corner cube is part of the hollow, then on the other side of each face, it could be either another cube or the hollow.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the hollow cube as a shell. The shell has an outer surface and an inner surface, but since it's hollow, the inner surface is the inner faces of the shell's cubes.\n\nEach small cube in the shell has some outer faces (painted) and some inner faces (unpainted). Also, each cube may have some adjacent cubes on other faces, which would have their faces adjacent to each other, so those are also unpainted.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the number of unpainted faces as follows:\n\nThe total number of small cube faces is 98 *6 =588.\n\nThe number of painted faces is the area of the outer surface: 6 faces, each 5x5=25. So 6*25=150.\n\nThe unpainted faces are 588-150=438.\n\nSo the answer is 438, which is option A.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought about the inner faces and the adjacent faces. But according to this calculation, the unpainted is 438, which matches option A.\n\nBut let me think again. Another approach: each small cube in the shell has 6 faces. For each cube, the number of painted faces is the number of faces on the exterior. The number of unpainted faces is 6 minus the number of painted faces.\n\nSo for each cube, the number of unpainted faces is 6 - (number of exterior faces it has).\n\nSo the total unpainted faces would be sum over all cubes of (6 - painted_faces).\n\nSo sum of all painted_faces is 150, as before. The sum of 6 for each cube is 98*6=588.\n\nSo total unpainted = 588 -150=438.\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nSo the correct answer is A)438.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the hollow cube structure. The cube has dimensions 5 cm \u00d7 5 cm \u00d7 5 cm, with a thickness of 1 cm. It is composed of smaller cubes of size 1 cm \u00d7 1 cm \u00d7 1 cm. Since the cube is hollow, the inner part is empty, and only the outer layer of small cubes forms the structure. \n\n### Step 1: Total number of small cubes\nThe total number of small cubes in a 5 cm \u00d7 5 cm \u00d7 5 cm cube is:\n\n\\[\n5^3 = 125\n\\]\n\nThe hollow interior has dimensions 3 cm \u00d7 3 cm \u00d7 3 cm (since the thickness is 1 cm on each side), so the number of small cubes in the hollow interior is:\n\n\\[\n3^3 = 27\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of small cubes in the hollow cube is:\n\n\\[\n125 - 27 = 98\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Total number of faces of all small cubes\nEach small cube has 6 faces. Therefore, the total number of faces for all 98 small cubes is:\n\n\\[\n98 \\times 6 = 588\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Number of painted faces\nThe outer surface of the hollow cube is painted. Each face of the hollow cube is a 5 cm \u00d7 5 cm square, which corresponds to a 5 \u00d7 5 grid of small cubes. Each face of the hollow cube has:\n\n\\[\n5 \\times 5 = 25 \\, \\text{small cube faces}\n\\]\n\nSince the hollow cube has 6 faces, the total number of painted faces is:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 25 = 150\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Number of unpainted faces\nThe total number of faces of all small cubes is 588, and the number of painted faces is 150. Therefore, the number of unpainted faces is:\n\n\\[\n588 - 150 = 438\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is:\n\n**Answer: A**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a hollow cube. Hmm, let me try to visualize it. The cube is 5 cm in size, but the thickness is 1 cm. Oh right, so it's made up of smaller 1 cm cubes. So each edge of the big cube is 5 cm, meaning there are 5 smaller cubes along each edge. But since it's hollow, only the outer layer is there\u2014like a cube shell.\n\nThe question is asking how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted. Oh wait, the outer surface is painted, so the inner surfaces (the hollow part) aren't painted. So the unpainted faces would be those that are inside the cube, not exposed on the outside.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many small cubes are there in total. Since the big cube is 5x5x5, that's 125 small cubes. But wait, it's hollow, so we subtract the inner part. The inner part would be a cube of size 3 cm because the thickness is 1 cm on each side. So the inner cube is 3x3x3, which is 27 small cubes. So the total number of small cubes in the hollow cube is 125 - 27 = 98 small cubes.\n\nBut wait, no, wait a second. Let me think again. No, wait, the hollow cube has a thickness of 1 cm. So the outer layer is 1 cm thick. So the inner dimensions would be 5 - 2*(1 cm) = 3 cm on each side. So the inner cube is indeed 3x3x3, 27 small cubes. So the total number of small cubes is 5^3 -3^3 = 125 -27 = 98. So 98 small cubes are in the hollow part.\n\nNow, each small cube has 6 faces. So the total number of faces is 98 *6 = 588. But some of these faces are on the inside (unpainted) and some are on the outside (painted). Wait, but the problem is about the faces of the small cubes that remain unpainted. So I need to find how many of those 588 faces are not painted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to think about the total number of painted faces and subtract that from the total to get the unpainted ones. Or perhaps calculate the unpainted directly.\n\nWait, each small cube in the hollow structure can have some of their faces on the exterior (painted) and some on the interior (unpainted). So the unpainted faces are those that are inside the cube, not exposed.\n\nBut wait, in a hollow cube, the inner surfaces aren't painted because they're inside. So each small cube that's part of the structure contributes to some unpainted faces.\n\nLet me think: for each face of the big cube, the outer layer is painted. The inner surfaces (the hollow part) are not painted. So the unpainted faces are the ones that are inside, i.e., the faces that are adjacent to other small cubes or to the hollow space.\n\nWait, but each small cube can have multiple faces. Some of their faces are on the outside (painted), others are adjacent to other cubes or the hollow (unpainted).\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to calculate the total number of faces in all small cubes and subtract the painted ones.\n\nTotal faces in all small cubes: 98 *6 = 588.\n\nNow, how many of these are painted? The painted faces are the ones on the outer surfaces of the big cube.\n\nThe big cube has 6 faces, each of 5x5 =25 small cube faces. So 6 *25 = 150 painted faces. But wait, each small cube on the surface contributes 1 or more painted faces. But wait, no, each face of the big cube is made up of 25 small cube faces. So the total painted faces would be 6 *25 =150. But wait, is that correct? Because each small cube on the corner is counted in multiple faces. Oh, but in terms of the number of painted small cube faces, it's just 6 *25 =150. So total painted small cube faces are 150.\n\nWait, but in the hollow cube, the outer surface is painted. So all the outer small cube faces are painted. So the painted faces are 6*(5^2) = 150. So the total painted is 150.\n\nTherefore, the unpainted faces are total faces (588) minus painted (150) equals 438.\n\nWait, but that's one of the options. Option A is 438. So the answer should be A.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I'm making a mistake in the way I'm calculating.\n\nWait another approach: Each small cube in the hollow structure has some of its faces on the exterior (painted) and some on the interior (unpainted). The number of unpainted faces per small cube depends on its position.\n\nFor example, a corner small cube in the hollow structure would have 3 faces exposed (painted) and 3 faces inside (unpainted). An edge cube (but not corner) would have 2 faces painted, etc.\n\nWait, but maybe calculating per cube is complicated. Alternatively, the total number of unpainted faces is the same as the total number of internal faces in the structure.\n\nWait, each internal face is shared between two small cubes. So the number of internal faces would be the number of adjacent small cubes multiplied by 2 (but I'm not sure). Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the entire cube.\n\nWait, the hollow cube has an outer layer of 1 cm. So the inner dimensions are 3x3x3.\n\nEach face of the hollow cube has an inner face of 3x3 =9 small cube faces. Since the hollow is 3x3x3, each face of the inner cube is 3x3. So the inner surfaces (unpainted) are 6*(3^2) =54. But wait, no, because each inner face is adjacent to the hollow space, not another small cube. Wait, no, because in the hollow cube, the inner walls are the unpainted faces of the small cubes that make up the structure.\n\nWait, no, the inner surfaces are the faces of the small cubes that are on the inside of the hollow cube. So each of these inner surfaces is a face of a small cube that is not painted.\n\nSo for each face of the hollow cube, the inner face has (5-2) x (5-2) =3x3=9 small cube faces. So the total inner faces are 6 *9 =54. But wait, that's the number of inner faces of the structure. But each inner face is a face of a small cube, so the total unpainted faces are 54.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right because when I subtract 150 from 588, I get 438, which is much larger than 54.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing something here. Let me think again.\n\nEach small cube in the hollow structure has some faces on the exterior (painted) and some on the interior (unpainted). The unpainted faces are those that are either adjacent to the hollow space or to another small cube.\n\nWait, but the hollow cube's interior is empty, so any face of a small cube that is adjacent to the hollow is unpainted. But each of these is a single face per small cube, but each such face is part of the inner surface.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the number of unpainted faces as the sum of the inner surfaces of the hollow cube.\n\nEach face of the hollow cube is 5x5=25, but the outer surface is painted, so the inner surface is 3x3=9. Each of these inner surfaces is made up of small cube faces. So the inner surfaces of the hollow cube contribute 6*(3*3)=54 unpainted faces.\n\nBut wait, each inner face is a face of a small cube. So that's 54 unpainted faces.\n\nBut that doesn't match with the earlier approach of 588-150=438.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the small cubes in the structure have internal faces between them that are also unpainted.\n\nWait, in the hollow cube, the small cubes are arranged in a 5x5x5 shell, with a 3x3x3 hollow inside. So the small cubes in the shell have some faces that are on the outside (painted) and some that are internal, either adjacent to the hollow or to other small cubes.\n\nSo the total unpainted faces would be the sum of all the internal faces of the small cubes.\n\nEach internal face is either between two small cubes or between a small cube and the hollow.\n\nSo for each small cube in the structure, count the number of its faces that are not on the exterior.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of internal faces is the same as the number of adjacent small cubes multiplied by 2 (each adjacency contributes to two faces), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: The entire hollow cube has a total surface area (painted) of 6*(5^2) =150 small cube faces. The total number of small cube faces in all the small cubes is 98 *6=588. So the unpainted faces would be 588 - 150 =438. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut earlier I thought that the inner surfaces (unpainted) are 54, which is much less than 438. So why the discrepancy?\n\nAh, because I think I made a mistake in considering only the inner surfaces. But the problem is not just the inner surfaces. Each small cube can have other faces that are adjacent to other small cubes in the structure. These adjacent faces are also unpainted, because they're inside the structure.\n\nWait, but in reality, the painted faces are only those on the exterior. The rest\u2014faces between small cubes and faces adjacent to the hollow\u2014are all unpainted.\n\nSo the total unpainted faces would be the sum of all faces of all small cubes minus the painted ones.\n\nSo 98 small cubes, each with 6 faces: 98*6=588.\n\nPainted faces: 6*(5^2)=150.\n\nUnpainted:588-150=438.\n\nSo the answer should be 438, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, another way: Each small cube can have some of its faces painted and others not. The number of painted faces per small cube depends on its position.\n\nFor example, a corner cube has 3 painted faces, an edge cube (non-corner) has 2, a face cube (non-edge) has 1, and the inner cubes have 0 painted faces. But in this case, the inner cubes are the 3x3x3, which are not part of the hollow structure.\n\nWait, no, the hollow structure's small cubes are arranged in a 5x5x5 shell. So each small cube is part of this shell, and their positions determine how many painted faces they have.\n\nBut this seems complicated, but perhaps we can compute the number of painted faces by calculating for each position type.\n\nNumber of corner cubes:8. Each has 3 painted faces. So 8 *3=24.\n\nNumber of edge cubes (excluding corners): Each edge of the cube has 5 cubes, but subtracting the 2 corners, we have 3 per edge. There are 12 edges. So 12 *3=36. Each edge cube has 2 painted faces. So 36 *2=72.\n\nNumber of face cubes (excluding edges and corners): Each face has (5-2)*(5-2) =3x3=9. But wait, each face has 5x5=25, subtract the edges and corners. So 25- (4 edges of 5 each, but subtracting overlaps). Alternatively, each face has (5-2)*(5-2)=9 cubes that are on the face but not on edges. So 6 faces, each with 9 such cubes. So 6*9=54. Each has 1 painted face. So 54 *1=54.\n\nWait, but 8 corners +36 edge +54 face = 98, which matches the total number of small cubes (5^3 -3^3=125-27=98).\n\nSo total painted faces: 24 (corners) +72 (edges) +54 (face centers) = 150. Which matches the earlier calculation of 6*25=150.\n\nSo the total painted is 150. So unpainted is 588-150=438.\n\nSo the answer is A)438.\n",

These adjacent faces are also unpainted, because they're inside the structure.\n\nWait, but in reality, the painted faces are only those on the exterior. The rest\u2014faces between small cubes and faces adjacent to the hollow\u2014are all unpainted.\n\nSo the total unpainted faces would be the sum of all faces of all small cubes minus the painted ones.\n\nSo 98 small cubes, each with 6 faces: 98*6=588.\n\nPainted faces: 6*(5^2)=150.\n\nUnpainted:588-150=438.\n\nSo the answer should be 438, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, another way: Each small cube can have some of its faces painted and others not. The number of painted faces per small cube depends on its position.\n\nFor example, a corner cube has 3 painted faces, an edge cube (non-corner) has 2, a face cube (non-edge) has 1, and the inner cubes have 0 painted faces. But in this case, the inner cubes are the 3x3x3, which are not part of the hollow structure.\n\nWait, no, the hollow structure's small cubes are arranged in a 5x5x5 shell. So each small cube is part of this shell, and their positions determine how many painted faces they have.\n\nBut this seems complicated, but perhaps we can compute the number of painted faces by calculating for each position type.\n\nNumber of corner cubes:8. Each has 3 painted faces. So 8 *3=24.\n\nNumber of edge cubes (excluding corners): Each edge of the cube has 5 cubes, but subtracting the 2 corners, we have 3 per edge. There are 12 edges. So 12 *3=36. Each edge cube has 2 painted faces. So 36 *2=72.\n\nNumber of face cubes (excluding edges and corners): Each face has (5-2)*(5-2) =3x3=9. But wait, each face has 5x5=25, subtract the edges and corners. So 25- (4 edges of 5 each, but subtracting overlaps). Alternatively, each face has (5-2)*(5-2)=9 cubes that are on the face but not on edges. So 6 faces, each with 9 such cubes. So 6*9=54. Each has 1 painted face. So 54 *1=54.\n\nWait, but 8 corners +36 edge +54 face = 98, which matches the total number of small cubes (5^3 -3^3=125-27=98).\n\nSo total painted faces: 24 (corners) +72 (edges) +54 (face centers) = 150. Which matches the earlier calculation of 6*25=150.\n\nSo the total painted is 150. So unpainted is 588-150=438.\n\nSo the answer is A)438.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the hollow cube of size 5 cm (outer dimensions) with a thickness of 1 cm. The cube is made of smaller 1 cm cubes. The total number of small cubes in the hollow cube is calculated as follows:\n\n1. **Total small cubes in the outer cube**:  \n   The outer cube is \\(5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 125\\) small cubes.\n\n2. **Inner hollow cube**:  \n   The hollow part is a smaller cube with thickness 1 cm, so its dimensions are \\(3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27\\) small cubes.\n\n3. **Total small cubes in the hollow structure**:  \n   Subtract the inner hollow cube from the outer cube:  \n   \\[\n   125 - 27 = 98 \\text{ small cubes}.\n   \\]\n\nEach small cube has 6 faces, so the total number of faces across all small cubes is:  \n\\[\n98 \\times 6 = 588 \\text{ faces}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of painted faces. The outer surface of the cube is painted, and each face of the outer cube is a \\(5 \\times 5\\) grid of small cube faces. The total number of painted faces is:  \n\\[\n6 \\times (5 \\times 5) = 6 \\times 25 = 150 \\text{ painted faces}.\n\\]\n\nThe number of unpainted faces is the total faces minus the painted faces:  \n\\[\n588 - 150 = 438 \\text{ unpainted faces}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is **438**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a hollow cube, and I need to figure out how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe cube is 5cm in size, and it's hollow with a thickness of 1cm. So, it's like a cube shell, right? And it's made up of smaller cubes that are 1cm each. So, the big cube must be constructed from these smaller cubes. Since the cube is 5cm on each edge, each edge has 5 small cubes.\n\nWait, but the cube is hollow, so the inner part is empty. That means the outer layer is 1cm thick. So, the inner dimensions would be 3cm on each side because 5 - 2*1 = 3. So, the inner part is a 3x3x3 cube, but it's empty, so those small cubes aren't there.\n\nNow, the question is about the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted. The outer surface is painted, so the small cubes on the surface will have some faces painted. The inner cubes, which aren't there, don't have any faces painted because they're not part of the structure.\n\nWait, but each small cube can have up to three faces painted if it's at a corner, two if it's on an edge but not a corner, one if it's on a face but not an edge, and none if it's inside. But in this case, since the cube is hollow, the inner part is empty, so only the outer layer's small cubes are present.\n\nSo, the first thing I need to do is figure out how many small cubes are there in total. The big cube is 5x5x5, which is 125 small cubes. But since it's hollow with thickness 1cm, the inner part is 3x3x3, which is 27 small cubes. So, the number of small cubes used is 125 - 27 = 98? Wait, no, wait. No, that's not right. Because the hollow part is the inner 3x3x3, but the outer layer is 5x5x5 minus the inner part. So, the number of small cubes is indeed 5^3 - 3^3 = 125-27=98.\n\nWait, but each of these small cubes is part of the outer structure. Now, the painting is done on the outer surface. So, the small cubes on the outer surface have some faces painted. But the question is about the faces of the small cubes that remain unpainted. So, each small cube can contribute 0 to 3 unpainted faces, depending on its position.\n\nWait, no. Wait, each face of a small cube is either painted or not. So, for each small cube, each of its faces is part of the outer surface, or internal. So, the ones on the edges, corners, etc., have some faces painted, and others not.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the total number of faces of all the small cubes that remain unpainted. So, each small cube contributes some number of unpainted faces. I need to sum all those.\n\nSo, the approach is: for each small cube in the hollow cube structure, calculate how many of its faces are unpainted, and sum all these numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to find the total number of faces for all the small cubes, and then subtract the number of painted faces.\n\nLet me think: each small cube has 6 faces. The total number of small cubes is 98. So, total faces = 98 * 6 = 588.\n\nNow, how many of these faces are painted? Because the outer surface is painted. The painted faces are the ones on the exterior of the big cube.\n\nThe big cube has 6 faces, each of size 5x5 cm. So each face has 25 small cube faces. So, total painted faces would be 6 * 25 = 150. But wait, no. Because each small cube on the edge or corner is counted multiple times.\n\nWait, no, that's not the right approach. Because when you paint the outer surface, each face of the big cube has 25 small cube faces painted. But each small cube can contribute to multiple painted faces. For example, a corner cube contributes 3 painted faces, each on a different face of the big cube.\n\nSo, the total painted faces are indeed 6 * 25 = 150. So, the total painted small cube faces are 150.\n\nSo, the total unpainted faces would be the total faces minus painted: 588 - 150 = 438.\n\nWait, but that's not right. Because in a hollow cube, the inner surfaces are also part of the small cubes. Wait, no. Because the inner part is empty, the small cubes are only on the outer layer. So, the inner surfaces (the ones that would be adjacent to the empty space) are not painted, but they are part of the small cubes.\n\nWait, no, the inner surfaces of the hollow cube are not painted, but those are the faces of the small cubes that are on the inner side of the shell. So, for example, each small cube on the outer layer has some faces on the outside (painted) and some on the inside (unpainted). So, the total painted faces are the ones on the outside of the big cube, which is 6 * 5^2 = 150. But the inner faces of the hollow cube's walls would also be unpainted. Wait, no, the small cubes are only on the outer shell. So, their inner faces are adjacent to empty space, but they are still part of the small cubes. So, each small cube in the outer shell has some of their faces exposed to the outside (painted) and some adjacent to the inner empty space (unpainted). So, each small cube in the outer shell has their internal faces as unpainted.\n\nWait, but wait: the small cubes in the outer shell form the 5x5x5 cube minus the inner 3x3x3. So, each small cube is on the surface of the big cube. So, for each small cube, how many of its faces are unpainted? That would be the number of faces that are on the inner side of the hollow part.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let's approach this differently.\n\nEach small cube on the outer shell (the hollow part) can have 0, 1, 2, or 3 painted faces, depending on whether it's on a corner, edge, face, or not. But all the other faces (not on the outer surface) are internal, so they are not painted. So, for each small cube, the number of unpainted faces is 6 minus the number of painted faces.\n\nSo, the total unpainted faces would be the sum over all small cubes of (6 - number of painted faces per cube).\n\nBut calculating this directly might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of faces of all small cubes is 98 * 6 = 588.\n\nThe number of painted faces is 6*(5^2) = 150, because each face of the big cube has 5x5 =25 small cube faces, and 6 faces.\n\nBut wait, that's not correct because each small cube on an edge is shared between multiple big cube faces. So, the count of 6*25 = 150 is correct because each small cube face is part of only one big cube face.\n\nWait, no, each small cube on a corner is part of three big cube faces, but each of those big cube faces counts each of the small cube's faces. So, for a corner cube, each of its three painted faces is counted in three different big cube faces. So, the total painted small cube faces are 6*25=150.\n\nSo, the painted faces are 150. So, unpainted faces are 588 - 150 = 438.\n\nSo, the answer would be 438, which is option A.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Because in the hollow cube, each small cube is part of the outer shell. But for the inner faces, the small cubes have faces that are adjacent to the empty space. So, are those faces considered unpainted? Yes, because the painting was done on the outer surfaces of the big cube.\n\nSo, the total number of unpainted faces includes both the internal faces (facing the hollow) and any other faces that are not on the outer surface.\n\nWait, but if the small cube is on the edge of the hollow, like in the outer shell, then each of its faces is either on the big cube's outer surface (painted) or on the inner surface (unpainted). But wait, no. Because each small cube is in the outer shell, so each has some faces on the outside (painted) and others inside (unpainted). So, for example, a small cube on the top face but not on an edge would have one face painted (the top), and the other five faces (front, back, left, right, bottom) are adjacent to other small cubes except for the bottom, which is part of the hollow. Wait, no, because in the hollow cube, the bottom is part of the big cube's outer surface, so that would be painted. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the calculation of 588 - 150 is correct. Let me think again.\n\nTotal small cubes: 5^3 - 3^3 = 125 - 27 = 98.\n\nEach small cube has 6 faces: 98 *6 = 588.\n\nThe outer surface of the big cube has 6 faces, each of 5x5=25 small cube faces. So, 6*25=150 painted small cube faces.\n\nSo, the unpainted small cube faces are 588 - 150 = 438.\n\nSo, the answer should be A)438.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.\n\nThe problem says there's a hollow cube, size 5 cm, with a thickness of 1 cm. It's made up of smaller cubes that are 1 cm each. The outer surface is painted, and we need to find out how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted. The options are given as A to E.\n\nHmm. So, first, I need to visualize this cube. A hollow cube, size 5 cm. Wait, size 5 cm\u2014does that mean each edge is 5 cm long? Because cubes have all sides equal. So the cube is 5 cm on each edge, but it's hollow, meaning the inside is empty. The thickness is 1 cm, so the walls of the cube are 1 cm thick. That makes sense because the thickness would be the distance from the outer surface to the inner hollow part.\n\nThe cube is made of smaller cubes of size 1 cm. So each small cube is 1x1x1 cm. Since the big cube is 5 cm on each edge, the total number of small cubes in the big cube would normally be 5^3, which is 125. But wait, it's hollow. So the hollow part is the inner cube. Let me think: the outer layer is 1 cm thick, so the inner hollow part would be a cube of size (5-2*1) cm on each edge. Because we subtract 1 cm from both ends of each edge. So 5 - 2 = 3 cm. So the inner cube is 3x3x3 cm, which is 27 small cubes. But wait, the problem says the cube is hollow, so the total number of small cubes used is the outer layer only. So the total number of small cubes is 5^3 - 3^3 = 125 - 27 = 98? Hmm, wait, but that can't be right because the options don't have 98 as an answer. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nWait, the problem states that the cube is hollow with a thickness of 1 cm. It's made of smaller cubes of size 1 cm. So perhaps the cube's outer dimensions are 5 cm, and the inner hollow part is 3 cm on each side, leaving a 1 cm thick shell. So the cube is a shell, and the total number of small cubes is 5x5x5 minus 3x3x3, which is 125 - 27 = 98 small cubes. So that's the total number of small cubes in the structure.\n\nBut the question isn't about the number of small cubes, but about the faces of the small cubes that remain unpainted. The outer surface is painted, so any face on the outer surface of the big cube will have its corresponding small cube face painted. The inner faces, those that are part of the hollow, are not exposed and thus their faces aren't painted either. So we need to count all the faces of all small cubes that are not on the outer surface.\n\nWait, but each small cube can have up to 6 faces. For each small cube, some of its faces are on the exterior (so painted), and others are either adjacent to another small cube or to the hollow inside (so not painted). But the problem is asking for how many faces of the small cubes are unpainted. So perhaps we need to calculate all the faces of all the small cubes and subtract the painted ones.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the total number of unpainted faces across all small cubes. Each small cube in the structure can contribute some unpainted faces. Let's think about each small cube's position in the big cube.\n\nThe big cube is 5x5x5. The hollow part is 3x3x3. So the structure is a 5x5x5 cube with a 3x3x3 cube removed from the center, leaving a 1 cm thick shell. But wait, actually, no\u2014because a hollow cube of thickness 1 cm would have the inner dimensions of 3x3x3. So the shell is the outer layer of 1 cm.\n\nEach small cube in this shell can be on the corner, edge, face, or perhaps in the interior of the shell. Wait, but the shell is only 1 cm thick, so any small cube in the shell is either on the corner, on an edge, or on a face.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to calculate the total number of small cubes, then for each, count the number of unpainted faces, and sum them all.\n\nWait, but each small cube can have multiple faces. So perhaps for each small cube, the number of unpainted faces is 6 minus the number of painted faces.\n\nEach small cube on the exterior has some of its faces painted. Let's think about each small cube's position:\n\n- Corner small cubes: each corner cube is part of three faces of the big cube. So each of these has 3 painted faces. So the number of unpainted faces per corner cube is 3.\n\n- Edge small cubes (not corners): each edge has small cubes that are on the edge but not at the corners. Each such cube is part of two faces of the big cube. So 2 painted faces, 4 unpainted.\n\n- Face small cubes (not edges or corners): each face has small cubes that are in the center of a face. Each such cube is part of one face, so 1 painted face, 5 unpainted.\n\n- But wait, in a 5x5x5 cube, the shell is 1 cm thick. So the inner part is 3x3x3. So the shell consists of all small cubes that are on the surface. Wait, perhaps another approach: each face of the big cube is a 5x5 square. So each face has 25 small cube faces painted. Since the cube has 6 faces, the total number of painted small cube faces is 6 * 25 = 150.\n\nWait, but each small cube can contribute to multiple painted faces if it's on an edge or corner. So the initial calculation of 150 painted faces is correct because each of the 6 big cube's faces has 25 small cube faces painted, totaling 150.\n\nBut each small cube in the shell contributes to one or more of these painted faces. Now, the total number of small cubes in the shell is 5^3 - 3^3 = 125 - 27 = 98, as I thought earlier.\n\nEach small cube in the shell has some number of painted faces. Let's calculate the total number of painted small cube faces.\n\nWait, the total painted faces are 6 * 25 = 150. So each of the 150 is a face of a small cube on the surface.\n\nBut each small cube in the shell can have 1, 2, or 3 painted faces. So the total number of painted small cube faces is 150. Therefore, the total number of unpainted faces is the sum over all small cubes of their unpainted faces.\n\nEach small cube has 6 faces. So for all 98 small cubes, the total number of faces is 98 * 6 = 588.\n\nOf these, 150 are painted. So the unpainted ones are 588 - 150 = 438. So the answer would be 438, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Because each small cube's face that's on the outside contributes to the painted count. But what about the inner faces of the shell? For example, the inner face of the shell (the hollow part) is 3x3x3, so each face of the hollow is 3x3=9 small cube faces. So the inner faces of the shell would have 6 * 9 = 54 small cube faces. But these are not painted because they're on the inside, right? So the problem is asking for unpainted faces, which includes both the inner faces and any other faces that aren't on the exterior.\n\nWait, no, because the problem says the outer surface is painted. So the outer surfaces are painted, but the inner surfaces (the hollow part) are not painted. So each face of the small cubes that is on the hollow's inner surfaces is also unpainted.\n\nWait, but in the earlier approach, I calculated the total number of painted faces as 150, and the total number of small cube faces as 98 *6=588. So the unpainted would be 588-150=438. But wait, that approach doesn't account for the inner faces. Because each small cube in the shell has some faces that are adjacent to the hollow, which are not painted. So those inner faces are also unpainted.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Because when I calculated 98 small cubes, each has 6 faces, but some of those faces are adjacent to the hollow, so they are not painted. So the total number of painted faces is 150, as before, but the number of unpainted faces would be the sum of all faces of all small cubes minus the painted ones, which includes both the outer and inner faces.\n\nWait, but that's what I did earlier. Because each small cube's face that's on the outside is painted, and those on the inside are not. So the total number of painted small cube faces is 150. So the total number of small cube faces is 98 *6=588. So 588 - 150=438 is the number of unpainted faces.\n\nBut wait, another approach: each small cube in the shell has a certain number of painted faces. Let's compute the number of small cubes with 3, 2, and 1 painted faces, then sum the unpainted faces.\n\nIn a cube, the corners have 3 painted faces. There are 8 corners, each contributing 3 painted faces, so 8*3=24.\n\nThen, the edges (excluding corners): each edge of the big cube has 5 small cubes, but the two at the ends are corners. So each edge has 5-2=3 small cubes that are on the edge but not corners. Each of these has 2 painted faces. There are 12 edges, so 12 *3=36 small cubes, each contributing 2 painted faces. So 36 *2=72.\n\nThen, the face centers: each face has a 5x5 grid. The corners are already counted, and the edges are counted. The remaining are the face centers. Each face has (5-2)*(5-2)=3x3=9 small cubes that are in the center of the face. Each of these has 1 painted face. So 6 faces *9=54 small cubes, each contributing 1 painted face. So 54 *1=54.\n\nSo total painted faces: 24 (corners) +72 (edges) +54 (face centers) = 150. Which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nNow, the number of small cubes in the shell is 8 (corners) +36 (edges) +54 (face centers) + (the inner shell) wait, no. Wait, the total small cubes in the shell are 98. Let me check the sum so far: 8 +36 +54 = 98? 8+36=44, 44+54=98. Oh, right. So that accounts for all 98 small cubes.\n\nEach small cube's painted faces: corners have 3, edges have 2, face centers have 1.\n\nSo the number of painted faces is 8*3 +36*2 +54*1=24 +72 +54=150.\n\nSo the total number of small cube faces is 98*6=588. So the unpainted faces are 588-150=438.\n\nSo the answer should be 438, which is option A.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. The problem is about the hollow cube. So the inner part is hollow, so the small cubes in the shell have some faces adjacent to the hollow, which are unpainted. But in the earlier approach, we considered all the unpainted faces, including those adjacent to the hollow. So that should be correct.\n\nBut let me think again. Each small cube in the shell has 6 faces. Some are on the exterior (painted), others are adjacent to other small cubes in the shell (so those faces are not painted), and others are adjacent to the hollow (unpainted as well). So, for example, a small cube on an edge of the shell has two painted faces (on the two adjacent big cube faces), and the other four faces are either adjacent to other small cubes or the hollow. So all those other faces are unpainted.\n\nWait, but in the earlier calculation, the total number of unpainted faces is 438, which includes both the inner faces (adjacent to the hollow) and the faces adjacent to other small cubes.\n\nBut the question is, how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted? So yes, that's correct because those inner faces are also unpainted.\n\nSo the correct answer should be 438, which is option A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the hollow cube structure and calculate the number of unpainted faces of the smaller cubes. The hollow cube has an outer dimension of 5 cm on each edge and a thickness of 1 cm, making the inner hollow part a 3 cm cube (removed from the center). The total number of small cubes in the structure is:\n\n\\[\n5^3 - 3^3 = 125 - 27 = 98\n\\]\n\nEach small cube has 6 faces, so the total number of faces across all small cubes is:\n\n\\[\n98 \\times 6 = 588\n\\]\n\nThe outer surface of the cube is painted.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.\n\nThe problem says there's a hollow cube, size 5 cm, with a thickness of 1 cm. It's made up of smaller cubes that are 1 cm each. The outer surface is painted, and we need to find out how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted. The options are given as A to E.\n\nHmm. So, first, I need to visualize this cube. A hollow cube, size 5 cm. Wait, size 5 cm\u2014does that mean each edge is 5 cm long? Because cubes have all sides equal. So the cube is 5 cm on each edge, but it's hollow, meaning the inside is empty. The thickness is 1 cm, so the walls of the cube are 1 cm thick. That makes sense because the thickness would be the distance from the outer surface to the inner hollow part.\n\nThe cube is made of smaller cubes of size 1 cm. So each small cube is 1x1x1 cm. Since the big cube is 5 cm on each edge, the total number of small cubes in the big cube would normally be 5^3, which is 125. But wait, it's hollow. So the hollow part is the inner cube. Let me think: the outer layer is 1 cm thick, so the inner hollow part would be a cube of size (5-2*1) cm on each edge. Because we subtract 1 cm from both ends of each edge. So 5 - 2 = 3 cm. So the inner cube is 3x3x3 cm, which is 27 small cubes. But wait, the problem says the cube is hollow, so the total number of small cubes used is the outer layer only. So the total number of small cubes is 5^3 - 3^3 = 125 - 27 = 98? Hmm, wait, but that can't be right because the options don't have 98 as an answer. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nWait, the problem states that the cube is hollow with a thickness of 1 cm. It's made of smaller cubes of size 1 cm. So perhaps the cube's outer dimensions are 5 cm, and the inner hollow part is 3 cm on each side, leaving a 1 cm thick shell. So the cube is a shell, and the total number of small cubes is 5x5x5 minus 3x3x3, which is 125 - 27 = 98 small cubes. So that's the total number of small cubes in the structure.\n\nBut the question isn't about the number of small cubes, but about the faces of the small cubes that remain unpainted. The outer surface is painted, so any face on the outer surface of the big cube will have its corresponding small cube face painted. The inner faces, those that are part of the hollow, are not exposed and thus their faces aren't painted either. So we need to count all the faces of all small cubes that are not on the outer surface.\n\nWait, but each small cube can have up to 6 faces. For each small cube, some of its faces are on the exterior (so painted), and others are either adjacent to another small cube or to the hollow inside (so not painted). But the problem is asking for how many faces of the small cubes are unpainted. So perhaps we need to calculate all the faces of all the small cubes and subtract the painted ones.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the total number of unpainted faces across all small cubes. Each small cube in the structure can contribute some unpainted faces. Let's think about each small cube's position in the big cube.\n\nThe big cube is 5x5x5. The hollow part is 3x3x3. So the structure is a 5x5x5 cube with a 3x3x3 cube removed from the center, leaving a 1 cm thick shell. But wait, actually, no\u2014because a hollow cube of thickness 1 cm would have the inner dimensions of 3x3x3. So the shell is the outer layer of 1 cm.\n\nEach small cube in this shell can be on the corner, edge, face, or perhaps in the interior of the shell. Wait, but the shell is only 1 cm thick, so any small cube in the shell is either on the corner, on an edge, or on a face.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to calculate the total number of small cubes, then for each, count the number of unpainted faces, and sum them all.\n\nWait, but each small cube can have multiple faces. So perhaps for each small cube, the number of unpainted faces is 6 minus the number of painted faces.\n\nEach small cube on the exterior has some of its faces painted. Let's think about each small cube's position:\n\n- Corner small cubes: each corner cube is part of three faces of the big cube. So each of these has 3 painted faces. So the number of unpainted faces per corner cube is 3.\n\n- Edge small cubes (not corners): each edge has small cubes that are on the edge but not at the corners. Each such cube is part of two faces of the big cube. So 2 painted faces, 4 unpainted.\n\n- Face small cubes (not edges or corners): each face has small cubes that are in the center of a face. Each such cube is part of one face, so 1 painted face, 5 unpainted.\n\n- But wait, in a 5x5x5 cube, the shell is 1 cm thick. So the inner part is 3x3x3. So the shell consists of all small cubes that are on the surface. Wait, perhaps another approach: each face of the big cube is a 5x5 square. So each face has 25 small cube faces painted. Since the cube has 6 faces, the total number of painted small cube faces is 6 * 25 = 150.\n\nWait, but each small cube can contribute to multiple painted faces if it's on an edge or corner. So the initial calculation of 150 painted faces is correct because each of the 6 big cube's faces has 25 small cube faces painted, totaling 150.\n\nBut each small cube in the shell contributes to one or more of these painted faces. Now, the total number of small cubes in the shell is 5^3 - 3^3 = 125 - 27 = 98, as I thought earlier.\n\nEach small cube in the shell has some number of painted faces. Let's calculate the total number of painted small cube faces.\n\nWait, the total painted faces are 6 * 25 = 150. So each of the 150 is a face of a small cube on the surface.\n\nBut each small cube in the shell can have 1, 2, or 3 painted faces. So the total number of painted small cube faces is 150. Therefore, the total number of unpainted faces is the sum over all small cubes of their unpainted faces.\n\nEach small cube has 6 faces. So for all 98 small cubes, the total number of faces is 98 * 6 = 588.\n\nOf these, 150 are painted. So the unpainted ones are 588 - 150 = 438. So the answer would be 438, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Because each small cube's face that's on the outside contributes to the painted count. But what about the inner faces of the shell? For example, the inner face of the shell (the hollow part) is 3x3x3, so each face of the hollow is 3x3=9 small cube faces. So the inner faces of the shell would have 6 * 9 = 54 small cube faces. But these are not painted because they're on the inside, right? So the problem is asking for unpainted faces, which includes both the inner faces and any other faces that aren't on the exterior.\n\nWait, no, because the problem says the outer surface is painted. So the outer surfaces are painted, but the inner surfaces (the hollow part) are not painted. So each face of the small cubes that is on the hollow's inner surfaces is also unpainted.\n\nWait, but in the earlier approach, I calculated the total number of painted faces as 150, and the total number of small cube faces as 98 *6=588. So the unpainted would be 588-150=438. But wait, that approach doesn't account for the inner faces. Because each small cube in the shell has some faces that are adjacent to the hollow, which are not painted. So those inner faces are also unpainted.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Because when I calculated 98 small cubes, each has 6 faces, but some of those faces are adjacent to the hollow, so they are not painted. So the total number of painted faces is 150, as before, but the number of unpainted faces would be the sum of all faces of all small cubes minus the painted ones, which includes both the outer and inner faces.\n\nWait, but that's what I did earlier. Because each small cube's face that's on the outside is painted, and those on the inside are not. So the total number of painted small cube faces is 150. So the total number of small cube faces is 98 *6=588. So 588 - 150=438 is the number of unpainted faces.\n\nBut wait, another approach: each small cube in the shell has a certain number of painted faces. Let's compute the number of small cubes with 3, 2, and 1 painted faces, then sum the unpainted faces.\n\nIn a cube, the corners have 3 painted faces. There are 8 corners, each contributing 3 painted faces, so 8*3=24.\n\nThen, the edges (excluding corners): each edge of the big cube has 5 small cubes, but the two at the ends are corners. So each edge has 5-2=3 small cubes that are on the edge but not corners. Each of these has 2 painted faces. There are 12 edges, so 12 *3=36 small cubes, each contributing 2 painted faces. So 36 *2=72.\n\nThen, the face centers: each face has a 5x5 grid. The corners are already counted, and the edges are counted. The remaining are the face centers. Each face has (5-2)*(5-2)=3x3=9 small cubes that are in the center of the face. Each of these has 1 painted face. So 6 faces *9=54 small cubes, each contributing 1 painted face. So 54 *1=54.\n\nSo total painted faces: 24 (corners) +72 (edges) +54 (face centers) = 150. Which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nNow, the number of small cubes in the shell is 8 (corners) +36 (edges) +54 (face centers) + (the inner shell) wait, no. Wait, the total small cubes in the shell are 98. Let me check the sum so far: 8 +36 +54 = 98? 8+36=44, 44+54=98. Oh, right. So that accounts for all 98 small cubes.\n\nEach small cube's painted faces: corners have 3, edges have 2, face centers have 1.\n\nSo the number of painted faces is 8*3 +36*2 +54*1=24 +72 +54=150.\n\nSo the total number of small cube faces is 98*6=588. So the unpainted faces are 588-150=438.\n\nSo the answer should be 438, which is option A.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. The problem is about the hollow cube. So the inner part is hollow, so the small cubes in the shell have some faces adjacent to the hollow, which are unpainted.

Each small cube in the shell has 6 faces. Some are on the exterior (painted), others are adjacent to other small cubes in the shell (so those faces are not painted), and others are adjacent to the hollow (unpainted as well). So, for example, a small cube on an edge of the shell has two painted faces (on the two adjacent big cube faces), and the other four faces are either adjacent to other small cubes or the hollow. So all those other faces are unpainted.\n\nWait, but in the earlier calculation, the total number of unpainted faces is 438, which includes both the inner faces (adjacent to the hollow) and the faces adjacent to other small cubes.\n\nBut the question is, how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted? So yes, that's correct because those inner faces are also unpainted.\n\nSo the correct answer should be 438, which is option A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the hollow cube structure and calculate the number of unpainted faces of the smaller cubes. The hollow cube has an outer dimension of 5 cm on each edge and a thickness of 1 cm, making the inner hollow part a 3 cm cube (removed from the center). The total number of small cubes in the structure is:\n\n\\[\n5^3 - 3^3 = 125 - 27 = 98\n\\]\n\nEach small cube has 6 faces, so the total number of faces across all small cubes is:\n\n\\[\n98 \\times 6 = 588\n\\]\n\nThe outer surface of the cube is painted.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about a hollow cube. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe cube is hollow, with a size of 5 cm, but the thickness is 1 cm. It's made up of smaller cubes, each 1 cm in size. The outer surface is painted, and we need to find out how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted.\n\nHmm, wait. So the cube is 5 cm on each side, but it's hollow and the walls are 1 cm thick. So the inside is empty space, I guess. And the entire outer surface is painted, so the outside faces of the small cubes on the surfaces will be painted.\n\nBut the question is about the faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted. Each small cube can have up to 6 faces, but if any are on the exterior, those faces get painted. So we need to count all the faces of all the small cubes that are not on the exterior.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the cube is hollow, so the inner surfaces are also exposed, right? Because it's hollow. So the inner surfaces would be the inner faces of the small cubes that form the walls. But since the cube is hollow, those inner faces are not painted because the paint is only on the outer surfaces.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the paint is only on the outer surfaces, so the inner surfaces of the walls (the thickness being 1 cm) are not painted. So the small cubes that make up the walls have their outer faces painted, but their inner faces are just part of the hollow space and thus not painted.\n\nWait, but each small cube can have multiple faces. So for each small cube, any face that's on the outside is painted, any face that's on the inside (if it's a wall cube) is not painted, and any face that's adjacent to another cube (inside the hollow) isn't painted either.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the structure.\n\nThe cube is 5 cm on each edge, but the thickness is 1 cm. So each face of the cube is a 5x5 cm square. The thickness being 1 cm means that the hollow part is 5 - 2*(1) = 3 cm on each side. So the inner dimensions are 3x3x3 cm? Or wait, no. Wait, the cube is 5 cm in size, but the thickness is 1 cm. So the hollow part inside would be a cube of 3x3x3 cm, because each side is reduced by 2 cm (1 cm on each side). So the structure is like a shell, 1 cm thick, surrounding a 3 cm cube.\n\nSo the total number of small cubes in the hollow cube is the outer volume minus the hollow part. The outer volume is 5x5x5 = 125 small cubes. The hollow part is 3x3x3 = 27 small cubes. So the number of small cubes in the shell is 125 - 27 = 98. Wait, that can't be right because 98 is less than 125. Wait, 5^3 is 125, 3^3 is 27, so 125-27=98. So there are 98 small cubes in the shell.\n\nBut each small cube is 1 cm, so the shell is made of 98 cubes. Now, each of these 98 cubes is on the surface of the larger cube.\n\nWait, but each cube on the surface can have some painted faces. The question is about how many faces of the small cubes are unpainted. Wait, no: the question says, how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted.\n\nWait, so each small cube can have 0 to 3 painted faces, depending on their position. But we're counting all the individual faces of all the small cubes that are not painted.\n\nSo the total number of faces is (number of small cubes) * 6. Then, subtract the number of painted faces.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the total number of painted faces and then subtract from the total possible faces to get the unpainted ones.\n\nWait, but each face of the larger cube is a 5x5 grid of small cube faces. So each face has 25 small faces painted. There are 6 faces on the cube, so 6*25 = 150 painted small cube faces.\n\nBut wait, that's only the outer surfaces. Each small cube's face that's on the outside is painted. So the total painted faces are 150. So the total unpainted faces would be total faces minus 150.\n\nWait, but how many small cubes are there? Each small cube has 6 faces, and there are 125 small cubes (since the outer cube is 5x5x5). So total small cube faces are 125 * 6 = 750.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the hollow cube only has 98 small cubes (since 5x5x5 is 125, minus 3x3x3=27, 98). Wait, wait, no. Wait, the problem says the cube is made of smaller cubes of size 1 cm, but it's hollow. So the hollow part is empty. So the actual number of small cubes is 125 - 27 = 98. So the total number of small cube faces is 98 *6 = 588.\n\nWait, but wait. The total number of small cubes is 98, each with 6 faces, so 588 total faces. But wait, no. Because the hollow cube has 98 small cubes, but each small cube can have up to 3 painted faces. So the painted faces are 150, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo unpainted faces would be 588 - 150 = 438.\n\nWait, but wait, 588 is the total number of faces for the 98 small cubes. But the initial approach may be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think differently. Each face of the larger cube has 5x5 =25 small cube faces. So 6 faces \u00d725 =150 painted faces. So the number of painted small cube faces is 150.\n\nBut each small cube can have multiple painted faces. For example, a corner cube has 3 painted faces, an edge cube (non-corner) has 2, and a face cube (non-edge) has 1.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to just compute the total painted faces as 6*25=150.\n\nBut wait, that's not correct because some small cube faces are painted on multiple sides. No, wait, each face of the large cube is a 2D grid, so each face contributes 25 painted small cube faces, and since there are 6 such faces, the total is 150.\n\nSo the total painted small cube faces are 150. Therefore, the total unpainted faces would be the total small cube faces minus 150.\n\nWait, but how many small cube faces are there in total?\n\nEach small cube has 6 faces. The number of small cubes is 98. So 98 \u00d76 = 588. So 588 -150=438.\n\nBut wait, wait. The 98 small cubes are all in the shell. So the total number of small cube faces is 98 \u00d76 = 588. So subtracting the 150 painted faces gives 588 -150=438 unpainted faces.\n\nSo the answer would be 438, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Another approach: each small cube in the shell contributes some number of painted faces. For the 98 small cubes, each is on the surface, so each has at least one face painted. But for the unpainted faces, perhaps it's easier to compute per cube.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of small cube faces is 588. The painted ones are 150, so unpainted is 438.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n",

The cube is made up of smaller cubes of size 1 cm.\n\n### Step 1: Total number of small cubes\nThe total number of small cubes in the outer volume is \\( 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 125 \\).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about a hollow cube. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe cube is hollow, with a size of 5 cm, but the thickness is 1 cm. It's made up of smaller cubes, each 1 cm in size. The outer surface is painted, and we need to find out how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted.\n\nHmm, wait. So the cube is 5 cm on each side, but it's hollow and the walls are 1 cm thick. So the inside is empty space, I guess. And the entire outer surface is painted, so the outside faces of the small cubes on the surfaces will be painted.\n\nBut the question is about the faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted. Each small cube can have up to 6 faces, but if any are on the exterior, those faces get painted. So we need to count all the faces of all the small cubes that are not on the exterior.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the cube is hollow, so the inner surfaces are also exposed, right? Because it's hollow. So the inner surfaces would be the inner faces of the small cubes that form the walls. But since the cube is hollow, those inner faces are not painted because the paint is only on the outer surfaces.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the paint is only on the outer surfaces, so the inner surfaces of the walls (the thickness being 1 cm) are not painted. So the small cubes that make up the walls have their outer faces painted, but their inner faces are just part of the hollow space and thus not painted.\n\nWait, but each small cube can have multiple faces. So for each small cube, any face that's on the outside is painted, any face that's on the inside (if it's a wall cube) is not painted, and any face that's adjacent to another cube (inside the hollow) isn't painted either.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the structure.\n\nThe cube is 5 cm on each edge, but the thickness is 1 cm. So each face of the cube is a 5x5 cm square. The thickness being 1 cm means that the hollow part is 5 - 2*(1) = 3 cm on each side. So the inner dimensions are 3x3x3 cm? Or wait, no. Wait, the cube is 5 cm in size, but the thickness is 1 cm. So the hollow part inside would be a cube of 3x3x3 cm, because each side is reduced by 2 cm (1 cm on each side). So the structure is like a shell, 1 cm thick, surrounding a 3 cm cube.\n\nSo the total number of small cubes in the hollow cube is the outer volume minus the hollow part. The outer volume is 5x5x5 = 125 small cubes. The hollow part is 3x3x3 = 27 small cubes. So the number of small cubes in the shell is 125 - 27 = 98. Wait, that can't be right because 98 is less than 125. Wait, 5^3 is 125, 3^3 is 27, so 125-27=98. So there are 98 small cubes in the shell.\n\nBut each small cube is 1 cm, so the shell is made of 98 cubes. Now, each of these 98 cubes is on the surface of the larger cube.\n\nWait, but each cube on the surface can have some painted faces. The question is about how many faces of the small cubes are unpainted. Wait, no: the question says, how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted.\n\nWait, so each small cube can have 0 to 3 painted faces, depending on their position. But we're counting all the individual faces of all the small cubes that are not painted.\n\nSo the total number of faces is (number of small cubes) * 6. Then, subtract the number of painted faces.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the total number of painted faces and then subtract from the total possible faces to get the unpainted ones.\n\nWait, but each face of the larger cube is a 5x5 grid of small cube faces. So each face has 25 small faces painted. There are 6 faces on the cube, so 6*25 = 150 painted small cube faces.\n\nBut wait, that's only the outer surfaces. Each small cube's face that's on the outside is painted. So the total painted faces are 150. So the total unpainted faces would be total faces minus 150.\n\nWait, but how many small cubes are there? Each small cube has 6 faces, and there are 125 small cubes (since the outer cube is 5x5x5). So total small cube faces are 125 * 6 = 750.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the hollow cube only has 98 small cubes (since 5x5x5 is 125, minus 3x3x3=27, 98). Wait, wait, no. Wait, the problem says the cube is made of smaller cubes of size 1 cm, but it's hollow. So the hollow part is empty. So the actual number of small cubes is 125 - 27 = 98. So the total number of small cube faces is 98 *6 = 588.\n\nWait, but wait. The total number of small cubes is 98, each with 6 faces, so 588 total faces. But wait, no. Because the hollow cube has 98 small cubes, but each small cube can have up to 3 painted faces. So the painted faces are 150, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo unpainted faces would be 588 - 150 = 438.\n\nWait, but wait, 588 is the total number of faces for the 98 small cubes. But the initial approach may be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think differently. Each face of the larger cube has 5x5 =25 small cube faces. So 6 faces \u00d725 =150 painted faces. So the number of painted small cube faces is 150.\n\nBut each small cube can have multiple painted faces. For example, a corner cube has 3 painted faces, an edge cube (non-corner) has 2, and a face cube (non-edge) has 1.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to just compute the total painted faces as 6*25=150.\n\nBut wait, that's not correct because some small cube faces are painted on multiple sides. No, wait, each face of the large cube is a 2D grid, so each face contributes 25 painted small cube faces, and since there are 6 such faces, the total is 150.\n\nSo the total painted small cube faces are 150. Therefore, the total unpainted faces would be the total small cube faces minus 150.\n\nWait, but how many small cube faces are there in total?\n\nEach small cube has 6 faces. The number of small cubes is 98. So 98 \u00d76 = 588. So 588 -150=438.\n\nBut wait, wait. The 98 small cubes are all in the shell. So the total number of small cube faces is 98 \u00d76 = 588. So subtracting the 150 painted faces gives 588 -150=438 unpainted faces.\n\nSo the answer would be 438, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Another approach: each small cube in the shell contributes some number of painted faces. For the 98 small cubes, each is on the surface, so each has at least one face painted. But for the unpainted faces, perhaps it's easier to compute per cube.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of small cube faces is 588. The painted ones are 150, so unpainted is 438.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the hollow cube structure. The cube has an outer size of 5 cm on each edge and a thickness of 1 cm, making it a hollow shell. The inner dimensions of the hollow part are 3 cm on each side (since the thickness reduces each dimension by 2 cm). The cube is made up of smaller cubes of size 1 cm.\n\n### Step 1: Total number of small cubes\nThe total number of small cubes in the outer volume is \\( 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 125 \\). The hollow inner part has dimensions \\( 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27 \\). Therefore, the number of small cubes in the shell (the hollow part subtracted from the outer volume) is:\n\n\\[\n125 - 27 = 98\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Total number of faces of the small cubes\nEach small cube has 6 faces.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a hollow cube, and I'm supposed to find out how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted after painting the outer surface. Let's see, I'll try to think it through step by step.\n\nAlright, the cube is hollow and has a size of 5 cm. I think that means each edge is 5 cm long. The thickness is 1 cm, so that suggests that the cube isn't solid\u2014it's like a box with walls that are 1 cm thick. So the inside must be empty space.\n\nIt's made up of smaller cubes, each of size 1 cm. Oh right, that makes sense because 5 cm divided by 1 cm gives 5 small cubes along each edge. So the entire structure is a 5x5x5 cube, but with the inside hollowed out, leaving only a 1 cm thick shell.\n\nNow, the question is about the outer surface being painted. So all the outer faces of the big cube are painted. I need to find how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted. Hmm. So each small cube can have up to 3 faces painted if it's on a corner, but the ones in the middle of faces or edges will have fewer. But wait, since the cube is hollow, some of the inner small cubes won't have any paint at all. But wait, the question is about the faces of the small cubes, not the cubes themselves. So I think I need to calculate all the small cube faces that are not on the outer surface.\n\nLet me try to visualize the cube. The big cube is 5x5x5, so each face is 5x5 = 25 small squares. Since it's hollow, the inner part is a 3x3x3 cube, right? Because 5-2*1=3. So the hollow part is 3x3x3.\n\nSo, the total number of small cubes in the big cube is 5^3 = 125. But the hollow part is 3^3=27, so the number of small cubes in the shell is 125-27=98. Wait, no, wait a second. Oh no, wait, no\u2014the hollow part is the interior, but since the thickness is 1 cm, the inner dimensions are 3 cm on each side. So each dimension reduces by 2 (1 cm from each side). So 5-2=3.\n\nWait, but the big cube is hollow, so the actual structure is just the outer layer of 1 cm. So the number of small cubes in the shell is 5^3 - (5-2)^3 = 125 -27=98. But wait, I'm not sure if that's necessary for this problem.\n\nThe question is about the number of faces that are unpainted. So the outer surfaces are painted. Each face of the big cube is painted, so each of the 6 faces has 25 small faces painted. But wait, each small cube's face is painted once if it's on the surface. But the problem is about the small cubes' faces, so each small cube's face that's on the exterior is painted. The ones inside are not painted.\n\nWait, but the cube is hollow, so the inner surfaces of the shell aren't painted. So for each small cube in the shell, some of its faces are on the outer surface (painted), and some are on the inner surface (unpainted). But wait, wait. The big cube's outer surfaces are painted, but the inner surfaces (like the hollow part) are not. So the small cubes in the shell have some faces on the outside (painted) and some on the inside (unpainted, because the hollow's inner surfaces aren't painted). Or are they? Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem states that the outer surface is painted. So only the outside faces of the big cube are painted. The inner surfaces of the shell (the hollow part) are not painted. So each small cube in the shell will have some faces on the exterior (painted) and some on the interior (unpainted). Additionally, the small cubes on the edges or corners will have more painted faces, but the inner cubes (of the shell) might have only one or two painted faces.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the number of faces that are unpainted. So for each small cube, the number of unpainted faces is the total faces (which is 6) minus the number of painted faces.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the total number of small cube faces in the entire structure and subtract the number of painted faces.\n\nWait, the total number of small cube faces in the entire structure is 125 small cubes, each with 6 faces: 125*6=750. But wait, this counts all the internal faces as well. But the problem is, some of these faces are glued together and aren't exposed, so we can't count them. So perhaps I should find the total number of exposed small cube faces, both on the outside and the inside of the shell, and then subtract that from the total to find the unpainted.\n\nWait, no. Because the outer surfaces are painted, but the inner surfaces of the shell are not. So the outer surfaces contribute painted small faces, and the inner surfaces contribute unpainted small faces.\n\nWait, maybe the approach should be: count all the small cube faces on the outer surface (painted) and on the inner surface (unpainted). Then, the total number of small cube faces that are on the outer or inner surfaces is the sum of these, and the rest (the internal, glued together) are not exposed and hence not painted.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to find the total number of small cube faces that are on the outer surfaces and the inner surfaces, then subtract the painted ones to find the unpainted.\n\nWait, but the outer surfaces are painted. The inner surfaces (the hollow part) are not. So each small cube in the shell has some faces on the outside (painted) and some on the inside (unpainted). The question is about how many of the small cube faces are unpainted, which includes both the inner faces of the shell and any other faces not on the outer surface.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: the total number of small cube faces that are on the outside (painted) is equal to the surface area of the big cube. Each face of the big cube is 5x5=25 small faces, and there are 6 faces. So 25*6=150 small faces painted.\n\nBut wait, that's only the outer surfaces. What about the inner surfaces of the hollow part? The inner surfaces of the hollow cube are also made up of small cube faces. Each inner face is part of the hollow's surfaces. Since the hollow is 3x3x3, each face of the hollow is 3x3=9 small faces. There are 6 faces on the hollow, so 9*6=54 small faces on the inner surfaces. These are not painted.\n\nSo the total number of small cube faces that are either painted or unpainted but exposed is 150 (painted) +54 (unpainted inner) = 204.\n\nBut wait, the small cubes in the shell have their faces on both the outer and inner surfaces. Each small cube in the shell contributes some faces to the outer and inner surfaces. The rest of their faces are glued to adjacent small cubes, so those are not exposed.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the total number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted. So that would be the sum of all the small cube's faces that are not painted. Which includes:\n\n1. The inner surfaces of the hollow (54 small faces) because they're not painted.\n2. The faces of the small cubes that are glued to adjacent cubes in the shell (these are internal, not on the outer or inner surfaces, so they're not painted either).\n\nWait, no. Because the question is about all the small cubes. Each small cube's face is either painted (if on the outside), unpainted but on the inner surface of the hollow, or not on any surface (glued to another cube), so it's unpainted as well.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the faces of the smaller cubes. Each small cube has 6 faces. Some are on the outside (painted), some are on the inside of the hollow (unpainted), and the rest are internal (also unpainted, because they're not part of any surface).\n\nSo the total unpainted faces would be all the small cube faces minus the painted ones.\n\nSo the total number of small cube faces is 125 *6 =750.\n\nThe number of painted small cube faces is 6 faces of the big cube, each 5x5=25. So 6*25=150.\n\nSo the number of unpainted small cube faces is 750 -150=600. But wait, that can't be right because the options don't have 600.\n\nWait, but wait. The hollow has inner surfaces as well. But the problem says that only the outer surfaces are painted. So the inner surfaces are not painted. So the small cubes on the inner surfaces have their faces unpainted. So the 150 is the painted faces, but the inner surfaces are also part of the small cubes' faces. So in this approach, we're only subtracting the painted faces, but we also have the inner surfaces contributing to the unpainted.\n\nWait, but in the initial approach, the total unpainted would be 750-150=600, but this includes both the inner surfaces and the internal glued faces. But the question is specifically about the small cubes, so perhaps this is correct.\n\nBut looking at the options, 600 is not an option. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. The cube is hollow, meaning that the interior is empty. So the small cubes are only on the shell, which is 1 cm thick. So the number of small cubes is 5^3 -3^3=125-27=98. So each of these 98 small cubes has some faces on the outside (painted) and some on the inside (unpainted, as the hollow is empty and not painted). The small cubes on the corners would have three painted faces, those on edges two, and those on faces one.\n\nWait, but the problem is about all the small cubes' faces, including those that are in the hollow's inner surfaces.\n\nWait, but perhaps the small cubes in the shell have some of their faces on the outer surface (painted) and some on the inner surface (unpainted). So for each small cube in the shell, the number of unpainted faces is (6 - number of painted faces). So the total unpainted is the sum over all small cubes in the shell of (6 - painted faces per cube).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute for each small cube in the shell:\n\n- For each cube, count how many of its faces are on the outside (painted), and then 6 minus that is the number of unpainted faces.\n\nBut that might be a bit tedious, but perhaps manageable.\n\nSo first, let's find out how many small cubes are on each type:\n\nIn a cube, the small cubes can be categorized as:\n\n1. Corner cubes: 8 in total. Each has 3 painted faces.\n2. Edge cubes (not corners): Each edge has (5-2) =3 small cubes. There are 12 edges. So 12 *3=36. Each has 2 painted faces.\n3. Face cubes (not edges or corners): Each face has (5-2)*(5-2)=3*3=9 small cubes. There are 6 faces, so 6*9=54. Each has 1 painted face.\n4. The inner cubes: 3x3x3=27, but these are not part of the shell.\n\nWait, but in this case, the shell is 1 cm thick, so the inner cubes are the 3x3x3, which are not part of the shell. So the shell consists of the 8 corners, 36 edges, 54 face centers, and 24? Wait, wait, perhaps I should recount.\n\nWait, the shell consists of all cubes that are on the outer layer. So the count is 5^3 -3^3=125-27=98.\n\nSo in the shell, the small cubes are:\n\n- 8 corners, each with 3 painted faces.\n- Each edge has (5-2)=3 cubes, but subtract the corners. So 12 edges, each with (5-2 -2)=1 cube? No, wait, each edge has 5 small cubes. The two ends are corners, so the remaining 3 are edge cubes (but wait, 5-2=3, so 3 per edge). So 12 edges *3=36 edge cubes, each with 2 painted faces.\n- Each face has (5-2)*(5-2)=3x3=9 face centers, each with 1 painted face. So 6 faces *9=54 face center cubes.\n\nSo 8 +36 +54=98, which matches the shell count.\n\nNow, for each category, calculate the number of unpainted faces.\n\n- Corner cubes (8): each has 3 painted faces. So each has 6-3=3 unpainted faces. So 8 *3=24 unpainted faces.\n- Edge cubes (36): each has 2 painted faces. So 6-2=4 unpainted per cube. 36*4=144.\n- Face center cubes (54): each has 1 painted face. So 6-1=5 unpainted per cube. 54*5=270.\n\nTotal unpainted faces: 24 +144 +270= 438.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. What about the inner surfaces of the shell? The hollow part is 3x3x3, so each inner face is 3x3=9. There are 6 inner faces, so 54 inner faces. These are part of the small cubes in the shell. Each inner face is an unpainted face of the small cube. So in the previous calculation, we considered each small cube's unpainted faces, which includes both the outer unpainted (like the inner surfaces) and the internal glued faces.\n\nWait no, in the earlier calculation, each small cube in the shell has some faces on the outside (painted) and some on the inside (unpainted). The 6- painted count already includes all the faces of the small cube, including the inner ones. So perhaps the calculation is correct, and the total is 438.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 438, option E is 498, D is 450, etc. So the answer should be A)438.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the initial approach I thought of was 600, but that's not an option. So maybe the correct approach is to calculate it per small cube in the shell, which gives 438 as the answer.\n",

So all the outer faces of the big cube are painted. I need to find how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted. Hmm. So each small cube can have up to 3 faces painted if it's on a corner, but the ones in the middle of faces or edges will have fewer. But wait, since the cube is hollow, some of the inner small cubes won't have any paint at all. But wait, the question is about the faces of the small cubes, not the cubes themselves. So I think I need to calculate all the small cube faces that are not on the outer surface.\n\nLet me try to visualize the cube. The big cube is 5x5x5, so each face is 5x5 = 25 small squares. Since it's hollow, the inner part is a 3x3x3 cube, right? Because 5-2*1=3. So the hollow part is 3x3x3.\n\nSo, the total number of small cubes in the big cube is 5^3 = 125. But the hollow part is 3^3=27, so the number of small cubes in the shell is 125-27=98. Wait, no, wait a second. Oh no, wait, no\u2014the hollow part is the interior, but since the thickness is 1 cm, the inner dimensions are 3 cm on each side. So each dimension reduces by 2 (1 cm from each side). So 5-2=3.\n\nWait, but the big cube is hollow, so the actual structure is just the outer layer of 1 cm. So the number of small cubes in the shell is 5^3 - (5-2)^3 = 125 -27=98. But wait, I'm not sure if that's necessary for this problem.\n\nThe question is about the number of faces that are unpainted. So the outer surfaces are painted. Each face of the big cube is painted, so each of the 6 faces has 25 small faces painted. But wait, each small cube's face is painted once if it's on the surface. But the problem is about the small cubes' faces, so each small cube's face that's on the exterior is painted. The ones inside are not painted.\n\nWait, but the cube is hollow, so the inner surfaces of the shell aren't painted. So for each small cube in the shell, some of its faces are on the outer surface (painted), and some are on the inner surface (unpainted). But wait, wait. The big cube's outer surfaces are painted, but the inner surfaces (like the hollow part) are not. So the small cubes in the shell have some faces on the outside (painted) and some on the inside (unpainted, because the hollow's inner surfaces aren't painted). Or are they? Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem states that the outer surface is painted. So only the outside faces of the big cube are painted. The inner surfaces of the shell (the hollow part) are not painted. So each small cube in the shell will have some faces on the exterior (painted) and some on the interior (unpainted). Additionally, the small cubes on the edges or corners will have more painted faces, but the inner cubes (of the shell) might have only one or two painted faces.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the number of faces that are unpainted. So for each small cube, the number of unpainted faces is the total faces (which is 6) minus the number of painted faces.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the total number of small cube faces in the entire structure and subtract the number of painted faces.\n\nWait, the total number of small cube faces in the entire structure is 125 small cubes, each with 6 faces: 125*6=750. But wait, this counts all the internal faces as well. But the problem is, some of these faces are glued together and aren't exposed, so we can't count them. So perhaps I should find the total number of exposed small cube faces, both on the outside and the inside of the shell, and then subtract that from the total to find the unpainted.\n\nWait, no. Because the outer surfaces are painted, but the inner surfaces of the shell are not. So the outer surfaces contribute painted small faces, and the inner surfaces contribute unpainted small faces.\n\nWait, maybe the approach should be: count all the small cube faces on the outer surface (painted) and on the inner surface (unpainted). Then, the total number of small cube faces that are on the outer or inner surfaces is the sum of these, and the rest (the internal, glued together) are not exposed and hence not painted.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to find the total number of small cube faces that are on the outer surfaces and the inner surfaces, then subtract the painted ones to find the unpainted.\n\nWait, but the outer surfaces are painted. The inner surfaces (the hollow part) are not. So each small cube in the shell has some faces on the outside (painted) and some on the inside (unpainted). The question is about how many of the small cube faces are unpainted, which includes both the inner faces of the shell and any other faces not on the outer surface.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: the total number of small cube faces that are on the outside (painted) is equal to the surface area of the big cube. Each face of the big cube is 5x5=25 small faces, and there are 6 faces. So 25*6=150 small faces painted.\n\nBut wait, that's only the outer surfaces. What about the inner surfaces of the hollow part? The inner surfaces of the hollow cube are also made up of small cube faces. Each inner face is part of the hollow's surfaces. Since the hollow is 3x3x3, each face of the hollow is 3x3=9 small faces. There are 6 faces on the hollow, so 9*6=54 small faces on the inner surfaces. These are not painted.\n\nSo the total number of small cube faces that are either painted or unpainted but exposed is 150 (painted) +54 (unpainted inner) = 204.\n\nBut wait, the small cubes in the shell have their faces on both the outer and inner surfaces. Each small cube in the shell contributes some faces to the outer and inner surfaces. The rest of their faces are glued to adjacent small cubes, so those are not exposed.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the total number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted. So that would be the sum of all the small cube's faces that are not painted. Which includes:\n\n1. The inner surfaces of the hollow (54 small faces) because they're not painted.\n2. The faces of the small cubes that are glued to adjacent cubes in the shell (these are internal, not on the outer or inner surfaces, so they're not painted either).\n\nWait, no. Because the question is about all the small cubes. Each small cube's face is either painted (if on the outside), unpainted but on the inner surface of the hollow, or not on any surface (glued to another cube), so it's unpainted as well.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the faces of the smaller cubes. Each small cube has 6 faces. Some are on the outside (painted), some are on the inside of the hollow (unpainted), and the rest are internal (also unpainted, because they're not part of any surface).\n\nSo the total unpainted faces would be all the small cube faces minus the painted ones.\n\nSo the total number of small cube faces is 125 *6 =750.\n\nThe number of painted small cube faces is 6 faces of the big cube, each 5x5=25. So 6*25=150.\n\nSo the number of unpainted small cube faces is 750 -150=600. But wait, that can't be right because the options don't have 600.\n\nWait, but wait. The hollow has inner surfaces as well. But the problem says that only the outer surfaces are painted. So the inner surfaces are not painted. So the small cubes on the inner surfaces have their faces unpainted. So the 150 is the painted faces, but the inner surfaces are also part of the small cubes' faces. So in this approach, we're only subtracting the painted faces, but we also have the inner surfaces contributing to the unpainted.\n\nWait, but in the initial approach, the total unpainted would be 750-150=600, but this includes both the inner surfaces and the internal glued faces. But the question is specifically about the small cubes, so perhaps this is correct.\n\nBut looking at the options, 600 is not an option. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. The cube is hollow, meaning that the interior is empty. So the small cubes are only on the shell, which is 1 cm thick. So the number of small cubes is 5^3 -3^3=125-27=98. So each of these 98 small cubes has some faces on the outside (painted) and some on the inside (unpainted, as the hollow is empty and not painted). The small cubes on the corners would have three painted faces, those on edges two, and those on faces one.\n\nWait, but the problem is about all the small cubes' faces, including those that are in the hollow's inner surfaces.\n\nWait, but perhaps the small cubes in the shell have some of their faces on the outer surface (painted) and some on the inner surface (unpainted). So for each small cube in the shell, the number of unpainted faces is (6 - number of painted faces). So the total unpainted is the sum over all small cubes in the shell of (6 - painted faces per cube).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute for each small cube in the shell:\n\n- For each cube, count how many of its faces are on the outside (painted), and then 6 minus that is the number of unpainted faces.\n\nBut that might be a bit tedious, but perhaps manageable.\n\nSo first, let's find out how many small cubes are on each type:\n\nIn a cube, the small cubes can be categorized as:\n\n1. Corner cubes: 8 in total. Each has 3 painted faces.\n2. Edge cubes (not corners): Each edge has (5-2) =3 small cubes. There are 12 edges. So 12 *3=36. Each has 2 painted faces.\n3. Face cubes (not edges or corners): Each face has (5-2)*(5-2)=3*3=9 small cubes. There are 6 faces, so 6*9=54. Each has 1 painted face.\n4. The inner cubes: 3x3x3=27, but these are not part of the shell.\n\nWait, but in this case, the shell is 1 cm thick, so the inner cubes are the 3x3x3, which are not part of the shell. So the shell consists of the 8 corners, 36 edges, 54 face centers, and 24? Wait, wait, perhaps I should recount.\n\nWait, the shell consists of all cubes that are on the outer layer. So the count is 5^3 -3^3=125-27=98.\n\nSo in the shell, the small cubes are:\n\n- 8 corners, each with 3 painted faces.\n- Each edge has (5-2)=3 cubes, but subtract the corners. So 12 edges, each with (5-2 -2)=1 cube? No, wait, each edge has 5 small cubes. The two ends are corners, so the remaining 3 are edge cubes (but wait, 5-2=3, so 3 per edge). So 12 edges *3=36 edge cubes, each with 2 painted faces.\n- Each face has (5-2)*(5-2)=3x3=9 face centers, each with 1 painted face. So 6 faces *9=54 face center cubes.\n\nSo 8 +36 +54=98, which matches the shell count.\n\nNow, for each category, calculate the number of unpainted faces.\n\n- Corner cubes (8): each has 3 painted faces. So each has 6-3=3 unpainted faces. So 8 *3=24 unpainted faces.\n- Edge cubes (36): each has 2 painted faces. So 6-2=4 unpainted per cube. 36*4=144.\n- Face center cubes (54): each has 1 painted face. So 6-1=5 unpainted per cube. 54*5=270.\n\nTotal unpainted faces: 24 +144 +270= 438.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. What about the inner surfaces of the shell? The hollow part is 3x3x3, so each inner face is 3x3=9. There are 6 inner faces, so 54 inner faces. These are part of the small cubes in the shell. Each inner face is an unpainted face of the small cube. So in the previous calculation, we considered each small cube's unpainted faces, which includes both the outer unpainted (like the inner surfaces) and the internal glued faces.\n\nWait no, in the earlier calculation, each small cube in the shell has some faces on the outside (painted) and some on the inside (unpainted). The 6- painted count already includes all the faces of the small cube, including the inner ones. So perhaps the calculation is correct, and the total is 438.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 438, option E is 498, D is 450, etc. So the answer should be A)438.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the initial approach I thought of was 600, but that's not an option. So maybe the correct approach is to calculate it per small cube in the shell, which gives 438 as the answer.\n\n\nThe problem involves a hollow cube of size 5 cm (each edge is 5 cm) with a thickness of 1 cm, made up of smaller cubes of size 1 cm. The outer surface of the cube is painted, and the task is to determine how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Structure of the Cube**:  \n   - The cube is hollow, with an outer shell of thickness 1 cm.  \n   - The total number of small cubes in the 5x5x5 structure is \\(5^3 = 125\\).  \n   - The hollow interior is a 3x3x3 cube, containing \\(3^3 = 27\\) small cubes.  \n   - The number of small cubes in the shell (outer layer) is \\(125 - 27 = 98\\).\n\n2. **Categories of Small Cubes in the Shell**:  \n   - **Corner Cubes**: There are 8 corner cubes, each with 3 painted faces.  \n   - **Edge Cubes**: Each edge of the cube has \\(5 - 2 = 3\\) small cubes (excluding corners). With 12 edges, there are \\(12 \\times 3 = 36\\) edge cubes, each with 2 painted faces.  \n   - **Face Center Cubes**: Each face has \\((5 - 2) \\times (5 - 2) = 3 \\times 3 = 9\\) small cubes (excluding edges). With 6 faces, there are \\(6 \\times 9 = 54\\) face center cubes, each with 1 painted face.  \n\n3. **Unpainted Faces Calculation**:  \n   - For each small cube, the number of unpainted faces is \\(6 - \\text{number of painted faces}\\).  \n   - **Corner Cubes**: Each corner cube has \\(3\\) painted faces, so \\(6 - 3 = 3\\) unpainted faces. Total unpainted faces for 8 corner cubes: \\(8 \\times 3 = 24\\).  \n   - **Edge Cubes**: Each edge cube has \\(2\\) painted faces, so \\(6 - 2 = 4\\) unpainted faces. Total unpainted faces for 36 edge cubes: \\(36 \\times 4 = 144\\).  \n   - **Face Center Cubes**: Each face center cube has \\(1\\) painted face, so \\(6 - 1 = 5\\) unpainted faces. Total unpainted faces for 54 face center cubes: \\(54 \\times 5 = 270\\).  \n\n4. **Total Unpainted Faces**:  \n   - Adding the unpainted faces from all categories:  \n     \\[\n     24 + 144 + 270 = 438\n     \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe total number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is **438**.  \n\nANSWER: A",
