      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quadratic equation problem here, and I need to find the largest integer value of 'k' that makes the equation have two real and distinct roots. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nThe equation given is x\u00b2 -5x + k = 0. I remember that for a quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, the discriminant determines the nature of the roots. The discriminant is b\u00b2 - 4ac. Oh right, if the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots. If it's zero, the roots are equal, and if it's negative, the roots are complex.\n\nSo, in this equation, a is 1, b is -5, and c is k. Let me calculate the discriminant. \n\nDiscriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac. Plugging in the values: (-5)\u00b2 - 4*(1)*(k) = 25 - 4k. \n\nFor two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be greater than zero. So, 25 -4k > 0. \n\nLet me solve this inequality. Subtract 25 from both sides? Wait, no, wait. Let me rearrange it. 25 -4k > 0 \u2192 -4k > -25. Now, when I divide both sides by a negative number (like -4), the inequality sign flips. So, dividing both sides by -4 gives k < 25/4. \n\nWait, 25 divided by 4 is 6.25. So k must be less than 6.25. But the question asks for the largest integral value of k. So the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. Wait, but wait, looking at the options, I don't see 6 as an option. Let me check the options again.\n\nThe options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Hmm, none of these are 6. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check my calculations. The discriminant is 25 -4k. For two real roots, 25-4k >0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k <25/4 \u2192 which is 6.25. So the maximum integer k can be is 6. But the options don't have 6. Did I misread the question?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs. Let me recheck. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant is (-5)^2 -4*1*k =25-4k. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the condition is 25-4k >0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192 k <25/4 \u2192 6.25. So the largest integer k is 6. But the options don't have 6. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look at the options again.\n\nWait, the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. So the highest option lower than 6.25 is 3. Wait, no, because 3 is way lower. Wait, maybe I messed up the inequality.\n\nWait another thought: if k is less than 6.25, then the largest integer possible is 6. But perhaps the options are wrong or perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that perhaps the question is about the integral values, so the maximum integer less than 6.25 is 6, but since 6 isn't an option, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong problem.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong equation. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant. Let me recalculate.\n\nDiscriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac. So (-5)^2 is 25, and 4ac is 4*1*k =4k. So D=25-4k. Correct.\n\nSo for D>0, 25-4k>0 \u2192 4k<25 \u2192 k < 6.25. So k can be 6, 5, etc. But none of the options are 6. So perhaps I've made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm supposed to have the equation in a different form. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the quadratic is written as x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. Maybe I should consider the quadratic formula. The roots are [5 \u00b1 sqrt(25-4k)] / 2. For the roots to be real and distinct, sqrt(25-4k) must be a real number, so the argument must be positive.\n\nSo 25-4k>0 \u2192 same as before. So k must be less than 6.25. So the largest integer is 6. But the options don't have 6. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are misprinted or I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant.\n\nWait another approach: Let me test each option to see if it gives a positive discriminant.\n\nLet's try option A: k=9. D=25-4*9=25-36= -11. That's negative, so no real roots. So A is invalid.\n\nOption B: k=7. D=25-28= -3. Negative again. So B is invalid.\n\nOption C: k=3. D=25-12=13. Positive. So two real roots. So C is valid, but it's not the largest.\n\nOption D: k=8. D=25-32= -7. Negative. So no real roots.\n\nOption E: k=12. D=25-48= -23. Negative.\n\nWait, so the only valid option among the given choices is C)3. Because when k=3, D is 13>0.\n\nWait, but that's the smallest option, not the largest. So perhaps I made a mistake in my initial approach. Because according to my calculation, the largest possible integer is 6, but none of the options are 6. So perhaps the correct answer is 6, but since it's not an option, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the maximum integer where the equation has real roots, regardless of being distinct. No, the question specifies two real and distinct roots, so the discriminant must be positive.\n\nWait, but according to the options given, the only valid k is 3. Because all higher options (7,8,9,12) give D negative. So perhaps the correct answer is C)3.\n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive because 3 is much lower than 6.25. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait another thought: maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the discriminant. Let me double-check. For k=7: D=25-4*7=25-28= -3. So D is negative, so no real roots. So 7 is invalid.\n\nk=6 would have D=25-24=1>0. So 6 works, but 6 is not an option. So the next lower integer is 5, which would be 25-20=5>0. So 5 works too, but again not an option.\n\nWait, but the options don't include 6 or 5. So perhaps the correct answer is C)3, but that seems incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the equation. Let me check the equation again. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So D=25-4k.\n\nWait, so when k=3, D=25-12=13>0 \u2192 valid.\n\nk=7: 25-28=-3 \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo among the options, only 3 and perhaps lower numbers are valid. So the largest among the options is 3.\n\nWait, but why is the correct answer not among the options? Because according to my calculation, the largest possible integer is 6, but it's not listed. So perhaps the question was written incorrectly, or I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate my approach.\n\nWait, maybe the quadratic is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. No, the question says x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So I think I'm correct.\n\nSo, given the options, the correct choice is C)3. Because it's the only one that satisfies the condition.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quadratic equation question here, and I need to find the largest integer value of k for which the equation has two real and distinct roots. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that for a quadratic equation of the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, the discriminant determines the nature of the roots. The discriminant is b\u00b2 - 4ac. Right, so if the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots. If it's zero, the roots are equal, and if it's negative, the roots are complex or imaginary.\n\nIn this case, the equation is x\u00b2 -5x + k = 0. Comparing to the general form, a is 1, b is -5, and c is k. So the discriminant D would be (-5)\u00b2 - 4*(1)*(k). Let me calculate that: (-5)^2 is 25, minus 4*1*k is 4k. So D = 25 -4k.\n\nFor two distinct real roots, D must be greater than zero. So 25 -4k > 0. Let me solve this inequality for k. Subtract 25 from both sides? Wait, no, better to rearrange. 25 >4k \u2192 25/4 >k. 25 divided by 4 is 6.25. So k must be less than 6.25.\n\nWait, the question asks for the largest integral value of k. So the integer less than 6.25 is 6, but wait, wait a second. Let me check again. Wait, 6.25 is 6 and a quarter. So the largest integer less than that is 6. But wait, let me look at the options again. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 6 isn't even an option. Did I make a mistake somewhere? Oh no, maybe I messed up the discriminant calculation. Let me go through it again.\n\nThe equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k.\n\nDiscriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac = (-5)^2 -4*(1)*k = 25 -4k. So yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo D must be positive: 25 -4k >0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k < 25/4 \u2192 which is 6.25. So k has to be less than 6.25. So the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. But looking at the options, none of them is 6. So I must have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the options. Let me check again. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Hmm, none of these are 6. So perhaps I made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait a minute, wait. Wait, perhaps the question is to find the largest integer k where the equation has two real and distinct roots. So k must be less than 6.25. So the largest integer is 6, but 6 isn't an option. So maybe I messed up the initial discriminant?\n\nWait, no, the equation is correct. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the discriminant. Let me think again: x\u00b2 -5x +k, so b is -5, so b\u00b2 is 25, 4ac is 4*1*k=4k. So D=25-4k. That's correct.\n\nWait, maybe the question was x\u00b2 -5x + k =0. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me think: the quadratic equation is ax\u00b2 + bx + c =0, so in this case, a=1, b=-5, c=k. So yes, discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac, which is (-5)^2 -4*1*k =25 -4k.\n\nSo the condition is 25 -4k >0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192k <6.25. So the largest integer is 6. But none of the options have 6. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k =0? Because then b would be 5, but the equation is given as x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So that's correct.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, the largest value less than 6.25 is 6, but it's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about the quadratic equation x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, and I'm looking for the largest integer k where there are two real and distinct roots. So k must be less than 6.25, so the maximum integer is 6. But in the options, the highest is 12, which is way larger. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the discriminant. Let me try another approach. The quadratic equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. The discriminant D is (5)^2 -4*1*k because perhaps I forgot the sign of b. Wait, no, because b is -5, but when squared, it's positive 25 regardless. So D=25 -4k. So for two distinct real roots, D must be positive: 25 -4k >0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k <6.25.\n\nSo k can be 6, but the options don't have 6. Hmm, perhaps the options are wrong or perhaps I made a mistake in the question.\n\nWait, maybe the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Let me recalculate that scenario. Then, a=1, b=5, c=k. D=5\u00b2 -4*1*k=25-4k. So same as before. So k must be less than 6.25.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equation is x\u00b2 -5x -k =0. Then c is -k. So D would be 25 -4*(1)*(-k)=25 +4k. So D=25+4k. For D>0, 25+4k>0 \u2192 4k> -25 \u2192k> -6.25. So any k greater than that would work. But in this case, the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, so c is positive k. So that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the options again. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nHmm, perhaps I misread the question. Wait, the question says 'the quadratic equation x\u00b2 -5x +k =0 will have two real and distinct roots'. So according to my earlier reasoning, k must be less than 6.25. So the maximum integer is 6, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate.\n\nD = b\u00b2 -4ac = (-5)^2 -4*(1)*(k) =25 -4k. For two distinct roots, D>0 \u2192 25 -4k>0 \u2192 4k<25 \u2192k <6.25.\n\nSo the maximum integer k is 6. But the options don't include 6. So perhaps the problem is different. Wait, maybe the quadratic equation is written differently. Oh wait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x + k =0, and I'm to find the largest integer k for which it has real and distinct roots. So perhaps I should check the options again. Wait, the options are 9,7,3,8,12.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think: perhaps I confused the inequality. Because 25 -4k>0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192k <6.25. So the largest integer is 6. So if the options don't have 6, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But that can't be, so perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.\n\nWait, maybe the equation is written as x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Let me check that. So a=1, b=5, c=k. D=25 -4k. So same as before. So k<6.25.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question is to find the largest k where the equation has two real roots, but I'm looking for the maximum k, so 6.25 is the limit, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the options are incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I should set up the equation with two real roots. Let me find the maximum k. So for the equation x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, the roots are real and distinct when D>0, which is when k<6.25. So the maximum integer is 6. But that's not an option, so maybe the options are wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is written differently. Oh wait, perhaps I read the equation incorrectly. Let me recheck the equation. The question says x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the options have a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that maybe I'm supposed to find the maximum k where the equation has real roots, including when D=0. But in that case, D=0 when k=6.25, but then the roots are equal. The question specifies two real and distinct roots, so D must be positive.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are correct, and I'm missing something. Let me try plugging in the options to see which is the largest k where D>0.\n\nSo option A is 9. Let's check D when k=9: D=25 -4*9=25-36= -11. That's negative, so no real roots.\n\nOption B is 7: D=25-4*7=25-28= -3. Also negative.\n\nOption C is 3: D=25-12=13>0. So yes, real roots.\n\nOption D is 8: D=25-32= -7. Negative.\n\nOption E is 12: D=25-48= -23. Negative.\n\nWait, so only option C (k=3) gives a positive discriminant. So why is the question asking for the largest integral value? Because all options except C give negative D, so only 3 is valid. So the largest possible k among the options is 3.\n\nBut that seems contradictory because earlier I thought the maximum k is 6.25, but the options don't include 6. So perhaps the correct answer is 3, which is option C.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because if I take k=6, which is less than 6.25, D=25-24=1>0. So the equation would have real roots. But 6 isn't an option, and the options only have 3 as the valid one.\n\nSo in the given options, the largest k where the equation has two distinct real roots is 3.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quadratic equation question here, and I need to find the largest integer value of k for which the equation has two real and distinct roots. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that for a quadratic equation of the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, the discriminant determines the nature of the roots. The discriminant is b\u00b2 - 4ac. Right, so if the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots. If it's zero, the roots are equal, and if it's negative, the roots are complex or imaginary.\n\nIn this case, the equation is x\u00b2 -5x + k = 0. Comparing to the general form, a is 1, b is -5, and c is k. So the discriminant D would be (-5)\u00b2 - 4*(1)*(k). Let me calculate that: (-5)^2 is 25, minus 4*1*k is 4k. So D = 25 -4k.\n\nFor two distinct real roots, D must be greater than zero. So 25 -4k > 0. Let me solve this inequality for k. Subtract 25 from both sides? Wait, no, better to rearrange. 25 >4k \u2192 25/4 >k. 25 divided by 4 is 6.25. So k must be less than 6.25.\n\nWait, the question asks for the largest integral value of k. So the integer less than 6.25 is 6, but wait, wait a second. Let me check again. Wait, 6.25 is 6 and a quarter. So the largest integer less than that is 6. But wait, let me look at the options again. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 6 isn't even an option. Did I make a mistake somewhere? Oh no, maybe I messed up the discriminant calculation. Let me go through it again.\n\nThe equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k.\n\nDiscriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac = (-5)^2 -4*(1)*k = 25 -4k. So yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo D must be positive: 25 -4k >0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k < 25/4 \u2192 which is 6.25. So k has to be less than 6.25. So the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. But looking at the options, none of them is 6. So I must have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the options. Let me check again. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Hmm, none of these are 6. So perhaps I made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait a minute, wait. Wait, perhaps the question is to find the largest integer k where the equation has two real and distinct roots. So k must be less than 6.25. So the largest integer is 6, but 6 isn't an option. So maybe I messed up the initial discriminant?\n\nWait, no, the equation is correct. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the discriminant. Let me think again: x\u00b2 -5x +k, so b is -5, so b\u00b2 is 25, 4ac is 4*1*k=4k. So D=25-4k. That's correct.\n\nWait, maybe the question was x\u00b2 -5x + k =0. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me think: the quadratic equation is ax\u00b2 + bx + c =0, so in this case, a=1, b=-5, c=k. So yes, discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac, which is (-5)^2 -4*1*k =25 -4k.\n\nSo the condition is 25 -4k >0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192k <6.25. So the largest integer is 6. But none of the options have 6. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k =0? Because then b would be 5, but the equation is given as x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So that's correct.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, the largest value less than 6.25 is 6, but it's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about the quadratic equation x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, and I'm looking for the largest integer k where there are two real and distinct roots. So k must be less than 6.25, so the maximum integer is 6. But in the options, the highest is 12, which is way larger. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the discriminant. Let me try another approach. The quadratic equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. The discriminant D is (5)^2 -4*1*k because perhaps I forgot the sign of b. Wait, no, because b is -5, but when squared, it's positive 25 regardless. So D=25 -4k. So for two distinct real roots, D must be positive: 25 -4k >0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k <6.25.\n\nSo k can be 6, but the options don't have 6. Hmm, perhaps the options are wrong or perhaps I made a mistake in the question.\n\nWait, maybe the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Let me recalculate that scenario. Then, a=1, b=5, c=k. D=5\u00b2 -4*1*k=25-4k. So same as before. So k must be less than 6.25.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equation is x\u00b2 -5x -k =0. Then c is -k. So D would be 25 -4*(1)*(-k)=25 +4k. So D=25+4k. For D>0, 25+4k>0 \u2192 4k> -25 \u2192k> -6.25. So any k greater than that would work. But in this case, the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, so c is positive k.

The discriminant is b\u00b2 - 4ac. Right, so if the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots. If it's zero, the roots are equal, and if it's negative, the roots are complex or imaginary.\n\nSo in this problem, the equation is x\u00b2 -5x + k = 0. Comparing to the standard form, a is 1, b is -5, and c is k.\n\nLet me write down the discriminant. Discriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac. Substituting the values, D = (-5)\u00b2 -4*(1)*k. So that's 25 -4k.\n\nFor two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be greater than zero. So 25 -4k > 0. Hmm, solving for k. Let's see, 25 >4k. Dividing both sides by 4, we get 25/4 >k. 25 divided by 4 is 6.25. So k must be less than 6.25.\n\nWait, the question asks for the largest integral value of k. So k has to be an integer less than 6.25. The largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. But wait, looking at the options, I don't see 6 as an option. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake? Let me double-check my calculation.\n\nWait, no. Let me go back. The discriminant is 25 -4k. For two real and distinct roots, D must be positive. So 25 -4k > 0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192 k < 25/4 \u2192 which is 6.25. So k must be less than 6.25. So the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. But none of the options are 6. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I substituted the values wrong. Let me check again. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So D = (-5)^2 -4*(1)*(k) = 25 -4k. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I confused the formula? Oh no, wait, no, the discriminant is correct. So then why are the options not including 6?\n\nWait, looking at the options again: the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Hmm, all these options are larger than 6.25. That can't be possible because if k is larger than 6.25, the discriminant becomes negative, leading to no real roots. So none of the options would work. But that can't be the case because the question is asking for the largest integer, implying that the correct option is among the given choices.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I inverted the inequality. Let me re-examine. 25 -4k >0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k <25/4=6.25. So yes, k must be less than 6.25.\n\nBut the options don't have 6. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, the question says \"the quadratic equation will have two real and distinct roots.\" So it's correct that k must be less than 6.25. So the maximum integer is 6, which is not an option here. But the options given are all higher than 6.25, which would make the discriminant negative. That would imply no real roots. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the discriminant. Let me recheck. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So D is b\u00b2-4ac = (-5)^2 -4*(1)*(k) =25-4k. Correct.\n\nWait, but maybe the equation is written differently? Like maybe it's x\u00b2 +5x +k=0, but no, the question says x\u00b2 -5x +k=0.\n\nHmm, so maybe the options are incorrect or I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the maximum k for which the equation has real roots, but the roots are not necessarily distinct. Wait, but the question specifically says two real and distinct roots, so D must be positive.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are wrong, but since that's not possible, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, perhaps it's a different quadratic. Let me reread the question.\n\nThe quadratic equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So my earlier approach is correct. So the maximum integer k is 6, but it's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nWait, the options given are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me compute 25-4k for each option and see if it's positive.\n\nOption A: k=9. D=25-4*9=25-36= -11. Negative. So two complex roots. So not acceptable.\n\nOption B: k=7. D=25-28= -3. Negative.

Negative.\n\nWait, so only option C gives a positive discriminant, which is 13. So the equation x\u00b2 -5x +3=0 has two real and distinct roots. So the largest integer k among the options is 3 (option C). But wait, the question is asking for the largest integral value of k. So 3 is the only one that works. But earlier I thought k could be up to 6.25, but the options don't have 6, but the highest possible k in the options that works is 3.\n\nWait, but that seems contradictory because 3 is much lower than 6.25. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is looking for the maximum k where the equation has real roots, but I thought that's only possible if k is less than 6.25. But in the options, 3 is the only one that works. So the answer would be 3, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, why are the other options not working? Because for k=7, D is negative, so no real roots. Same for higher k's. Only k=3 gives D=13, which is positive.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C, which is 3.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quadratic equation problem here, and I need to find the largest integer value of 'k' such that the equation has two real and distinct roots. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nWait, I remember that for a quadratic equation of the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, the discriminant determines the nature of the roots. The discriminant is b\u00b2 - 4ac. Right, so if the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots. If it's zero, the roots are equal, and if it's negative, the roots are complex or imaginary.\n\nSo in this problem, the equation is x\u00b2 -5x + k = 0. Comparing to the standard form, a is 1, b is -5, and c is k.\n\nLet me write down the discriminant. Discriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac. Substituting the values, D = (-5)\u00b2 -4*(1)*k. So that's 25 -4k.\n\nFor two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be greater than zero. So 25 -4k > 0. Hmm, solving for k. Let's see, 25 >4k. Dividing both sides by 4, we get 25/4 >k. 25 divided by 4 is 6.25. So k must be less than 6.25.\n\nWait, the question asks for the largest integral value of k. So k has to be an integer less than 6.25. The largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. But wait, looking at the options, I don't see 6 as an option. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake? Let me double-check my calculation.\n\nWait, no. Let me go back. The discriminant is 25 -4k. For two real and distinct roots, D must be positive. So 25 -4k > 0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192 k < 25/4 \u2192 which is 6.25. So k must be less than 6.25. So the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. But none of the options are 6. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I substituted the values wrong. Let me check again. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So D = (-5)^2 -4*(1)*(k) = 25 -4k. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I confused the formula? Oh no, wait, no, the discriminant is correct. So then why are the options not including 6?\n\nWait, looking at the options again: the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Hmm, all these options are larger than 6.25. That can't be possible because if k is larger than 6.25, the discriminant becomes negative, leading to no real roots. So none of the options would work. But that can't be the case because the question is asking for the largest integer, implying that the correct option is among the given choices.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I inverted the inequality. Let me re-examine. 25 -4k >0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k <25/4=6.25. So yes, k must be less than 6.25.\n\nBut the options don't have 6. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, the question says \"the quadratic equation will have two real and distinct roots.\" So it's correct that k must be less than 6.25. So the maximum integer is 6, which is not an option here. But the options given are all higher than 6.25, which would make the discriminant negative. That would imply no real roots. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the discriminant. Let me recheck. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So D is b\u00b2-4ac = (-5)^2 -4*(1)*(k) =25-4k. Correct.\n\nWait, but maybe the equation is written differently? Like maybe it's x\u00b2 +5x +k=0, but no, the question says x\u00b2 -5x +k=0.\n\nHmm, so maybe the options are incorrect or I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the maximum k for which the equation has real roots, but the roots are not necessarily distinct. Wait, but the question specifically says two real and distinct roots, so D must be positive.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are wrong, but since that's not possible, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, perhaps it's a different quadratic. Let me reread the question.\n\nThe quadratic equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So my earlier approach is correct. So the maximum integer k is 6, but it's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nWait, the options given are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me compute 25-4k for each option and see if it's positive.\n\nOption A: k=9. D=25-4*9=25-36= -11. Negative. So two complex roots. So not acceptable.\n\nOption B: k=7. D=25-28= -3. Negative. Not acceptable.\n\nOption C: k=3. D=25-12=13. Positive. So two distinct real roots. So acceptable.\n\nOption D: k=8. D=25-32= -7. Negative.\n\nOption E: k=12. D=25-48= -23. Negative.\n\nWait, so only option C gives a positive discriminant, which is 13. So the equation x\u00b2 -5x +3=0 has two real and distinct roots. So the largest integer k among the options is 3 (option C). But wait, the question is asking for the largest integral value of k. So 3 is the only one that works. But earlier I thought k could be up to 6.25, but the options don't have 6, but the highest possible k in the options that works is 3.\n\nWait, but that seems contradictory because 3 is much lower than 6.25. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is looking for the maximum k where the equation has real roots, but I thought that's only possible if k is less than 6.25. But in the options, 3 is the only one that works. So the answer would be 3, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, why are the other options not working? Because for k=7, D is negative, so no real roots. Same for higher k's. Only k=3 gives D=13, which is positive.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C, which is 3.\n\n\nTo determine the largest integral value of \\( k \\) for which the quadratic equation \\( x^2 - 5x + k = 0 \\) has two real and distinct roots, we analyze the discriminant of the quadratic equation. For a general quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the discriminant is given by \\( D = b^2 - 4ac \\). If \\( D > 0 \\), the equation has two real and distinct roots.\n\nFor the given equation \\( x^2 - 5x + k = 0 \\), the coefficients are \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -5 \\), and \\( c = k \\). Substituting these values into the discriminant formula:\n\n\\[\nD = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(k) = 25 - 4k\n\\]\n\nFor the equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must satisfy \\( D > 0 \\):\n\n\\[\n25 - 4k > 0 \\implies 4k < 25 \\implies k < \\frac{25}{4} = 6.25\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( k \\) must be less than \\( 6.25 \\). Since the question asks for the largest integral value of \\( k \\), the maximum integer less than \\( 6.25 \\) is \\( 6 \\). However, none of the provided options include \\( 6 \\).\n\nTo verify, we evaluate the discriminant for each option:\n\n- **Option A (\\( k = 9 \\))**: \\( D = 25 - 4(9) = 25 - 36 = -11 \\) (negative, no real roots).\n- **Option B (\\( k = 7 \\))**: \\( D = 25 - 4(7) = 25 - 28 = -3 \\) (negative, no real roots).\n- **Option C (\\( k = 3 \\))**: \\( D = 25 - 4(3) = 25 - 12 = 13 \\) (positive, two real and distinct roots).\n- **Option D (\\( k = 8 \\))**: \\( D = 25 - 4(8) = 25 - 32 = -7 \\) (negative, no real roots).\n- **Option E (\\( k = 12 \\))**: \\( D = 25 - 4(12) = 25 - 48 = -23 \\) (negative, no real roots).\n\nAmong the options, only \\( k = 3 \\) (Option C) satisfies the condition \\( D > 0 \\), making it the correct answer.\n\nAnswer: C",

Maybe the question is x\u00b2 -5k x + something else. Wait, no, the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0.\n\nSo I'm confused because none of the options fit the condition. Unless I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I should try each option to see which gives a positive discriminant. Let's do that.\n\nOption A: k=9.\n\nDiscriminant: 25-4*9=25-36= -11 \u2192 negative. So no.\n\nOption B: k=7. D=25-28= -3 \u2192 negative. No.\n\nOption C: k=3. D=25-12=13>0 \u2192 yes.\n\nOption D: k=8. D=25-32= -7 \u2192 negative. No.\n\nOption E: k=12. D=25-48= -23 \u2192 negative. No.\n\nSo the only option that works is C)3. But the question asks for the largest possible k. So the largest among the options is C)3. But wait, that's the only one that works. So perhaps the correct answer is C)3.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because 3 is the smallest option. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Oh wait, perhaps the question is about the equation having two real roots, but not necessarily distinct. Then, discriminant >=0, so k<=6.25. So the maximum integer is 6, which is not an option. But the options don't have 6.\n\nWait, but maybe the question is phrased differently. Let me read it again. It says two real and distinct roots, so discriminant must be positive. So the only valid option is 3.\n\nSo the answer must be C)3. But that seems counterintuitive because 3 is a small number. But according to the options, it's the only one that works.\n\n\nTo determine the largest integral value of \\( k \\) for which the quadratic equation \\( x^2 - 5x + k = 0 \\) has two real and distinct roots, we analyze the discriminant of the quadratic equation. For a general quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the discriminant is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\n\\]\n\nFor the given equation \\( x^2 - 5x + k = 0 \\), the coefficients are \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -5 \\), and \\( c = k \\). Substituting these into the discriminant formula:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(k) = 25 - 4k\n\\]\n\nFor the equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be positive:\n\n\\[\n25 - 4k > 0\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( k \\):\n\n\\[\n25 - 4k > 0 \\implies 4k < 25 \\implies k < \\frac{25}{4} = 6.25\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( k \\) must be less than \\( 6.25 \\). The largest integer value of \\( k \\) that satisfies this condition is \\( 6 \\). However, \\( 6 \\) is not among the provided options. To verify, we check each option to see if it satisfies \\( k < 6.25 \\):\n\n- **Option A (\\( k = 9 \\))**: \\( 9 > 6.25 \\), so the discriminant is negative, and the roots are not real.\n- **Option B (\\( k = 7 \\))**: \\( 7 > 6.25 \\), so the discriminant is negative, and the roots are not real.\n- **Option C (\\( k = 3 \\))**: \\( 3 < 6.25 \\), so the discriminant is positive, and the roots are real and distinct.\n- **Option D (\\( k = 8 \\))**: \\( 8 > 6.25 \\), so the discriminant is negative, and the roots are not real.\n- **Option E (\\( k = 12 \\))**: \\( 12 > 6.25 \\), so the discriminant is negative, and the roots are not real.\n\nAmong the options, only \\( k = 3 \\) satisfies the condition for two real and distinct roots. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: C**",

The question is asking for the largest integral value of 'k' such that the equation x\u00b2 -5x +k = 0 has two real and distinct roots. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nHmm, I remember from algebra that for a quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, the discriminant determines the nature of the roots. The discriminant is b\u00b2 - 4ac. If the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots. If it's zero, there's exactly one real root, and if it's negative, the roots are complex.\n\nSo in this problem, I need the discriminant to be positive. Let me write down the equation again: x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. Comparing to the standard form, a is 1, b is -5, and c is k.\n\nCalculating the discriminant: D = b\u00b2 -4ac. Plugging in the values, D = (-5)\u00b2 -4*(1)*k = 25 -4k.\n\nWait, so for the equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be greater than zero. So 25 -4k > 0.\n\nLet me solve that inequality. 25 -4k >0 \u2192 -4k > -25. Hmm, when I divide both sides by a negative number, the inequality sign flips. So dividing both sides by -4, I get k < 25/4.\n\nWhat's 25 divided by 4? That's 6.25. So k has to be less than 6.25.\n\nBut the question is asking for the largest integral value of k. So the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 6. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Oh, none of these is 6.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake? Let me double-check the calculations. So D = (-5)^2 -4*1*k \u2192 25 -4k. That's correct. The condition is D>0 \u2192 25-4k>0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k <25/4. 25 divided by 4 is 6.25. So k must be less than 6.25.\n\nSo the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6, but it's not an option. Oh wait, maybe I misread the options. Let me look again.\n\nThe options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Hmm, so the closest lower than 6.25 is 6, but that's not available. So maybe I made a mistake in the discriminant.\n\nWait, wait. Let me check the equation again. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac \u2192 (-5)^2 =25, 4ac is 4*1*k=4k. So 25-4k>0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192k <6.25. So yes, that's correct.\n\nBut the options don't include 6. So perhaps the problem is asking for the largest integer value for which the equation has real roots, but maybe I'm missing something else. Or perhaps the options have a typo. Wait, maybe I read the equation wrong. Let me check the original question again.\n\nThe question says: x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. No, that's correct. So what's wrong here? Because according to this, the maximum k is 6.25, so the largest integer is 6. But none of the options is 6. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the equation is written differently. Let me think: Did I write down the equation correctly? The user wrote x2 -5x +k =0. So x squared minus 5x plus k equals zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k =0? No, that's not what the user wrote. So maybe I miscalculated the discriminant.\n\nWait, let me recalculate. a is 1, b is -5, c is k. So D = b\u00b2 -4ac = (-5)^2 -4*(1)*k \u2192 25 -4k. Yep, that's right.\n\nSo the condition is 25 -4k >0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192k <6.25.\n\nSo the largest integer k can be is 6. But the options don't have 6. So looking at the options, the next possible lower is 3, but that's option C. But 3 is much lower than 6. So perhaps the question is about the maximum integer where it's still possible, but maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about this differently. The quadratic equation will have two real and distinct roots when the discriminant is positive. So, as k increases, the discriminant decreases. So the maximum k before discriminant becomes zero is 6.25.\n\nSo the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6, but that's not an option. So perhaps the options have a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation.\n\nWait, perhaps the original equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, but maybe it's written as x\u00b2 +5x +k =0. Let me check again. The user wrote x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So no, that's correct.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Hmm. So perhaps the user intended to write a different equation. Alternatively, perhaps I need to re-express the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant sign. Let me recheck. The discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. So, for x\u00b2 -5x +k, a=1, b=-5, c=k.\n\nSo D = (-5)^2 -4*(1)*(k) =25 -4k. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo if k has to be less than 6.25, the maximum integer is 6. But it's not among the options. So perhaps the problem is looking for the maximum k such that the roots are real and distinct, but perhaps the options have a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the equation. Let me think again. Oh wait! Maybe the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, but perhaps I have the signs wrong. Let me write it again: x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So a is positive 1, b is negative 5, c is positive k.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the quadratic formula. The roots are [5 \u00b1 sqrt(25 -4k)]/2.\n\nSo for real and distinct roots, sqrt(25-4k) must be real, so 25-4k>0 \u2192 same as before.\n\nSo the maximum k is 6.25, so the largest integer is 6, but it's not an option. So perhaps the options have a typo. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the quadratic equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k = 0, and the question is about the maximum integer k where the equation has two real and distinct roots. So the options are given, but none is 6. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the quadratic equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k =0. Let me see what happens then. Then a=1, b=5, c=k. So D = 25 -4k. Wait, same as before. So same conclusion. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is 5x\u00b2 -x +k=0. Let me check that. Then a=5, b=-1, c=k. Then D = (-1)^2 -4*5*k =1 -20k. For D>0, 1-20k>0 \u219220k <1 \u2192k <1/20. That's even worse; the maximum k would be 0, which is not an option either.\n\nSo that's not the case. So the original equation must be correct. So perhaps the problem is that I'm miscalculating the discriminant.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the equation differently. Let me re-express the equation: x\u00b2 -5x +k =0.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is about integer roots, but the question says two real and distinct roots, not necessarily integer roots. So the discriminant approach is correct.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the options are wrong, but that's not likely. Alternatively, maybe I misread the question. Oh wait! The question says the largest integral value of 'k' for which the equation will have two real and distinct roots. So perhaps the options are correct, but I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is written as x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, but the quadratic is written in terms of x\u00b2 + bx +c, so perhaps I should double-check.\n\nWait, no. The quadratic is x squared minus 5x plus k. So discriminant is 25-4k. So k must be less than 6.25. So the largest integer is 6. But 6 is not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the maximum possible k given the options. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. So 6 is not an option, so the next possible is 3, but that's lower. Alternatively, perhaps I should check each option to see which is the maximum where the discriminant is positive.\n\nWait, that's a good approach. Let me test each option:\n\nOption E: 12. So k=12. D=25-4*12=25-48= -23. Negative, so no real roots. So E is invalid.\n\nOption A: 9. D=25-4*9=25-36= -11. Negative. So A is invalid.\n\nOption B:7. D=25-28= -3. Negative. So B is invalid.\n\nOption D:8. D=25-32= -7. Negative. So D is invalid.\n\nOption C:3. D=25-12=13. Positive. So roots are real and distinct.\n\nSo the only valid option is C)3. But that's the smallest option, not the largest. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Because according to the discriminant, only when k is less than 6.25, which is 6.25, so the largest integer is 6. But none of the options is 6. So the largest possible k among the options is 3, which is option C. But that's the smallest option given. So perhaps the problem is written incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the maximum k such that the equation has real roots, and perhaps I should pick the maximum k among the options where D is positive.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, only option C gives D positive. So the correct answer would be C)3, but that's the smallest option. That can't be right.\n\nWait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the discriminant.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-calculate the discriminant for each option.\n\nLet me list the options and compute D for each:\n\nOption A: k=9 \u2192 D=25 -4*9=25-36= -11 \u2192 negative.\n\nOption B: k=7 \u2192 D=25-28= -3 \u2192 negative.\n\nOption C: k=3 \u2192 D=25-12=13 \u2192 positive.\n\nOption D: k=8 \u2192 D=25-32= -7 \u2192 negative.\n\nOption E: k=12 \u2192 D=25-48= -23 \u2192 negative.\n\nSo only option C gives a positive discriminant. So the only possible value is C)3. So the question is asking for the largest integral value of k where the equation has two real and distinct roots. But according to the options, the only valid k is 3, which is the smallest option.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Because according to my earlier calculation, any k less than 6.25 is valid. So if the options are correct, then perhaps the correct answer is C)3, but that's the smallest. That can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant calculation.\n\nWait, wait a second. I think I know where I went wrong. Oh no! Wait, perhaps I swapped a and c in the discriminant formula. Wait, no. The discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. In this equation, a is 1, b is -5, c is k. So 4ac is 4*1*k=4k. So 25-4k.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about this differently. Let me think about what happens when k is 6. Then D=25-24=1>0. So that's valid. When k=6.25, D=0. So for k=6, it's valid, but the options don't have 6. So perhaps the options are wrong. But looking back, the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly. Maybe the quadratic is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Let me check that. Then a=1, b=5, c=k. D=25-4k. Same as before. So same conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the quadratic is written as x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, and the question is looking for the largest integer k such that the equation has real roots, which would be 6, but that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Let me check that. Then D=25-4k. So same as before.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe the problem is asking for the maximum k such that the equation has two real roots, which are both integers. But the problem doesn't say that; it just says real and distinct. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the correct answer is 6, but it's not an option. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, or perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, but the question is about the maximum k for which the equation has two real roots. So the maximum k is 6, but not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but among the given options, the largest that satisfies the condition is 3. But that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the discriminant. Let me check again. For option D: k=8. D=25-4*8=25-32=-7 \u2192 negative. So invalid. Option B:7 \u2192 D=25-28= -3 \u2192 negative. So only option C is valid.\n\nSo the correct answer is C)3, but that's the smallest option. That's strange. So perhaps the problem's options are wrong, or perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x -k =0. Let me check that. Then c would be -k. So discriminant is 25 -4*(1)*(-k) =25 +4k. So D=25+4k. So for D>0, 25+4k>0 \u2192 4k> -25 \u2192k> -6.25. So in that case, any k greater than -6.25 would work. But the question is about the largest integral value, which would be unbounded. So that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Then D=25-4k. So same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the sum or product of roots, but I don't think so. Because the sum is 5, product is k.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. According to the options, the only valid k is 3. But that's the smallest option. So perhaps the correct answer is C)3. But that feels wrong because I thought k could be up to 6.25.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is written as x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, but the options are for the value of k where the equation has two equal roots, which would require D=0. But the question clearly states two real and distinct roots, so D must be positive.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the problem statement. It says, \"the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x\u00b2 -5x +k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots.\"\n\nSo according to my calculations, the maximum k is 6.25, so 6 is the largest integer. But 6 is not among the options. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but since the options are given, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Let me check that again. Then D=25-4k. So same as before. So same conclusion.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the equation is written as x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, and the problem is to find the maximum k such that the equation has two real roots, regardless of them being distinct. Wait, but the question says \"two real and distinct roots,\" so D must be positive.\n\nHmm. So given that, perhaps the problem's options are wrong. But in the given options, only option C)3 is valid. So the answer would be C)3.\n\nBut that seems odd. Let me think again: perhaps the problem is written correctly, and I'm just making a mistake in the discriminant.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute D for each option again.\n\nOption A: k=9 \u2192 D=25-36= -11 \u2192 negative. So no.\n\nOption B: k=7 \u2192 D=25-28= -3 \u2192 negative. No.\n\nOption C: k=3 \u2192 D=25-12=13 \u2192 positive. So yes.\n\nOption D: k=8 \u2192 D=25-32= -7 \u2192 negative. No.\n\nOption E: k=12 \u2192 D=25-48= -23 \u2192 negative. No.\n\nSo the only option where the equation has two real and distinct roots is C)3. So the largest integral value of k among the options is 3. So the answer is C.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because 3 is the smallest option. So perhaps the problem is written incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the smallest value, but that's not what it says.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should conclude that the correct answer is C)3, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant calculation.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, and I'm to find the maximum k where the equation has two real roots. So, perhaps I should think in terms of the quadratic graph. The parabola opens upwards (since a=1>0). The minimum point is at x = -b/(2a) =5/(2) =2.5. The minimum value is f(2.5) = (2.5)^2 -5*(2.5) +k =6.25 -12.5 +k =k -6.25. For the quadratic to have two real roots, the minimum value must be below zero. So k -6.25 <0 \u2192k<6.25. So same conclusion as before.\n\nSo again, the maximum integer k is 6, but it's not an option. So the next is 3.\n\nBut perhaps the options are wrong, but since I have to choose from the given options, the correct answer is C)3.\n",

Let me double-check the calculations. So D = (-5)^2 -4*1*k \u2192 25 -4k. That's correct. The condition is D>0 \u2192 25-4k>0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k <25/4. 25 divided by 4 is 6.25. So k must be less than 6.25.\n\nSo the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6, but it's not an option. Oh wait, maybe I misread the options. Let me look again.\n\nThe options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Hmm, so the closest lower than 6.25 is 6, but that's not available. So maybe I made a mistake in the discriminant.\n\nWait, wait. Let me check the equation again. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac \u2192 (-5)^2 =25, 4ac is 4*1*k=4k. So 25-4k>0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192k <6.25. So yes, that's correct.\n\nBut the options don't include 6. So perhaps the problem is asking for the largest integer value for which the equation has real roots, but maybe I'm missing something else. Or perhaps the options have a typo. Wait, maybe I read the equation wrong. Let me check the original question again.\n\nThe question says: x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. No, that's correct. So what's wrong here? Because according to this, the maximum k is 6.25, so the largest integer is 6. But none of the options is 6. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the equation is written differently. Let me think: Did I write down the equation correctly? The user wrote x2 -5x +k =0. So x squared minus 5x plus k equals zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k =0? No, that's not what the user wrote. So maybe I miscalculated the discriminant.\n\nWait, let me recalculate. a is 1, b is -5, c is k. So D = b\u00b2 -4ac = (-5)^2 -4*(1)*k \u2192 25 -4k. Yep, that's right.\n\nSo the condition is 25 -4k >0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192k <6.25.\n\nSo the largest integer k can be is 6. But the options don't have 6. So looking at the options, the next possible lower is 3, but that's option C. But 3 is much lower than 6. So perhaps the question is about the maximum integer where it's still possible, but maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about this differently. The quadratic equation will have two real and distinct roots when the discriminant is positive. So, as k increases, the discriminant decreases. So the maximum k before discriminant becomes zero is 6.25.\n\nSo the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6, but that's not an option. So perhaps the options have a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation.\n\nWait, perhaps the original equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, but maybe it's written as x\u00b2 +5x +k =0. Let me check again. The user wrote x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So no, that's correct.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Hmm. So perhaps the user intended to write a different equation. Alternatively, perhaps I need to re-express the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant sign. Let me recheck. The discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. So, for x\u00b2 -5x +k, a=1, b=-5, c=k.\n\nSo D = (-5)^2 -4*(1)*(k) =25 -4k. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo if k has to be less than 6.25, the maximum integer is 6. But it's not among the options. So perhaps the problem is looking for the maximum k such that the roots are real and distinct, but perhaps the options have a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the equation. Let me think again. Oh wait! Maybe the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, but perhaps I have the signs wrong. Let me write it again: x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So a is positive 1, b is negative 5, c is positive k.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the quadratic formula. The roots are [5 \u00b1 sqrt(25 -4k)]/2.\n\nSo for real and distinct roots, sqrt(25-4k) must be real, so 25-4k>0 \u2192 same as before.\n\nSo the maximum k is 6.25, so the largest integer is 6, but it's not an option. So perhaps the options have a typo. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the quadratic equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k = 0, and the question is about the maximum integer k where the equation has two real and distinct roots. So the options are given, but none is 6. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the quadratic equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k =0. Let me see what happens then. Then a=1, b=5, c=k. So D = 25 -4k. Wait, same as before. So same conclusion. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is 5x\u00b2 -x +k=0. Let me check that. Then a=5, b=-1, c=k. Then D = (-1)^2 -4*5*k =1 -20k. For D>0, 1-20k>0 \u219220k <1 \u2192k <1/20. That's even worse; the maximum k would be 0, which is not an option either.\n\nSo that's not the case. So the original equation must be correct. So perhaps the problem is that I'm miscalculating the discriminant.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the equation differently. Let me re-express the equation: x\u00b2 -5x +k =0.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is about integer roots, but the question says two real and distinct roots, not necessarily integer roots. So the discriminant approach is correct.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the options are wrong, but that's not likely. Alternatively, maybe I misread the question. Oh wait! The question says the largest integral value of 'k' for which the equation will have two real and distinct roots. So perhaps the options are correct, but I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is written as x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, but the quadratic is written in terms of x\u00b2 + bx +c, so perhaps I should double-check.\n\nWait, no. The quadratic is x squared minus 5x plus k. So discriminant is 25-4k. So k must be less than 6.25. So the largest integer is 6. But 6 is not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the maximum possible k given the options. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. So 6 is not an option, so the next possible is 3, but that's lower. Alternatively, perhaps I should check each option to see which is the maximum where the discriminant is positive.\n\nWait, that's a good approach. Let me test each option:\n\nOption E: 12. So k=12. D=25-4*12=25-48= -23. Negative, so no real roots. So E is invalid.\n\nOption A: 9. D=25-4*9=25-36= -11. Negative. So A is invalid.\n\nOption B:7. D=25-28= -3. Negative. So B is invalid.\n\nOption D:8. D=25-32= -7. Negative. So D is invalid.\n\nOption C:3. D=25-12=13. Positive. So roots are real and distinct.\n\nSo the only valid option is C)3. But that's the smallest option, not the largest. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Because according to the discriminant, only when k is less than 6.25, which is 6.25, so the largest integer is 6. But none of the options is 6. So the largest possible k among the options is 3, which is option C. But that's the smallest option given. So perhaps the problem is written incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the maximum k such that the equation has real roots, and perhaps I should pick the maximum k among the options where D is positive.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, only option C gives D positive. So the correct answer would be C)3, but that's the smallest option. That can't be right.\n\nWait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the discriminant.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-calculate the discriminant for each option.\n\nLet me list the options and compute D for each:\n\nOption A: k=9 \u2192 D=25 -4*9=25-36= -11 \u2192 negative.\n\nOption B: k=7 \u2192 D=25-28= -3 \u2192 negative.\n\nOption C: k=3 \u2192 D=25-12=13 \u2192 positive.\n\nOption D: k=8 \u2192 D=25-32= -7 \u2192 negative.\n\nOption E: k=12 \u2192 D=25-48= -23 \u2192 negative.\n\nSo only option C gives a positive discriminant. So the only possible value is C)3. So the question is asking for the largest integral value of k where the equation has two real and distinct roots. But according to the options, the only valid k is 3, which is the smallest option.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Because according to my earlier calculation, any k less than 6.25 is valid. So if the options are correct, then perhaps the correct answer is C)3, but that's the smallest. That can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant calculation.\n\nWait, wait a second. I think I know where I went wrong. Oh no! Wait, perhaps I swapped a and c in the discriminant formula. Wait, no. The discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. In this equation, a is 1, b is -5, c is k. So 4ac is 4*1*k=4k. So 25-4k.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about this differently. Let me think about what happens when k is 6. Then D=25-24=1>0. So that's valid. When k=6.25, D=0. So for k=6, it's valid, but the options don't have 6. So perhaps the options are wrong. But looking back, the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly. Maybe the quadratic is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Let me check that. Then a=1, b=5, c=k. D=25-4k. Same as before. So same conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the quadratic is written as x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, and the question is looking for the largest integer k such that the equation has real roots, which would be 6, but that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Let me check that. Then D=25-4k. So same as before.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe the problem is asking for the maximum k such that the equation has two real roots, which are both integers. But the problem doesn't say that; it just says real and distinct. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the correct answer is 6, but it's not an option. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, or perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, but the question is about the maximum k for which the equation has two real roots. So the maximum k is 6, but not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but among the given options, the largest that satisfies the condition is 3. But that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the discriminant. Let me check again. For option D: k=8. D=25-4*8=25-32=-7 \u2192 negative. So invalid. Option B:7 \u2192 D=25-28= -3 \u2192 negative. So only option C is valid.\n\nSo the correct answer is C)3, but that's the smallest option. That's strange. So perhaps the problem's options are wrong, or perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x -k =0. Let me check that. Then c would be -k. So discriminant is 25 -4*(1)*(-k) =25 +4k. So D=25+4k. So for D>0, 25+4k>0 \u2192 4k> -25 \u2192k> -6.25. So in that case, any k greater than -6.25 would work. But the question is about the largest integral value, which would be unbounded. So that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Then D=25-4k. So same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the sum or product of roots, but I don't think so. Because the sum is 5, product is k.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. According to the options, the only valid k is 3. But that's the smallest option. So perhaps the correct answer is C)3. But that feels wrong because I thought k could be up to 6.25.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is written as x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, but the options are for the value of k where the equation has two equal roots, which would require D=0. But the question clearly states two real and distinct roots, so D must be positive.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the problem statement. It says, \"the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x\u00b2 -5x +k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots.\"\n\nSo according to my calculations, the maximum k is 6.25, so 6 is the largest integer. But 6 is not among the options. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but since the options are given, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Let me check that again. Then D=25-4k. So same as before. So same conclusion.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the equation is written as x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, and the problem is to find the maximum k such that the equation has two real roots, regardless of them being distinct. Wait, but the question says \"two real and distinct roots,\" so D must be positive.\n\nHmm. So given that, perhaps the problem's options are wrong. But in the given options, only option C)3 is valid. So the answer would be C)3.\n\nBut that seems odd. Let me think again: perhaps the problem is written correctly, and I'm just making a mistake in the discriminant.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute D for each option again.\n\nOption A: k=9 \u2192 D=25-36= -11 \u2192 negative. So no.\n\nOption B: k=7 \u2192 D=25-28= -3 \u2192 negative. No.\n\nOption C: k=3 \u2192 D=25-12=13 \u2192 positive. So yes.\n\nOption D: k=8 \u2192 D=25-32= -7 \u2192 negative. No.\n\nOption E: k=12 \u2192 D=25-48= -23 \u2192 negative. No.\n\nSo the only option where the equation has two real and distinct roots is C)3. So the largest integral value of k among the options is 3. So the answer is C.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because 3 is the smallest option. So perhaps the problem is written incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the smallest value, but that's not what it says.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should conclude that the correct answer is C)3, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant calculation.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, and I'm to find the maximum k where the equation has two real roots. So, perhaps I should think in terms of the quadratic graph. The parabola opens upwards (since a=1>0). The minimum point is at x = -b/(2a) =5/(2) =2.5. The minimum value is f(2.5) = (2.5)^2 -5*(2.5) +k =6.25 -12.5 +k =k -6.25. For the quadratic to have two real roots, the minimum value must be below zero. So k -6.25 <0 \u2192k<6.25. So same conclusion as before.\n\nSo again, the maximum integer k is 6, but it's not an option. So the next is 3.\n\nBut perhaps the options are wrong, but since I have to choose from the given options, the correct answer is C)3.\n\n\nTo determine the largest integral value of \\( k \\) for which the quadratic equation \\( x^2 - 5x + k = 0 \\) has two real and distinct roots, we use the discriminant condition. For a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the discriminant is given by \\( D = b^2 - 4ac \\). If \\( D > 0 \\), the equation has two real and distinct roots.\n\n### Step 1: Identify coefficients\nFor the given equation \\( x^2 - 5x + k = 0 \\), the coefficients are:\n- \\( a = 1 \\)\n- \\( b = -5 \\)\n- \\( c = k \\)\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the discriminant\nThe discriminant is:\n\\[\nD = b^2 - 4ac = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(k) = 25 - 4k\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Set the discriminant condition\nFor two real and distinct roots, \\( D > 0 \\):\n\\[\n25 - 4k > 0\n\\]\n\\[\n4k < 25\n\\]\n\\[\nk < \\frac{25}{4} = 6.25\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Determine the largest integer \\( k \\)\nThe largest integer less than \\( 6.25 \\) is \\( 6 \\). However, \\( 6 \\) is not among the provided options. Therefore, we must test the given options to find the largest \\( k \\) that satisfies \\( D > 0 \\).\n\n### Step 5: Test each option\n- **Option A (\\( k = 9 \\)):**\n  \\[\n  D = 25 - 4(9) = 25 - 36 = -11 \\quad (\\text{Negative, invalid})\n  \\]\n- **Option B (\\( k = 7 \\)):**\n  \\[\n  D = 25 - 4(7) = 25 - 28 = -3 \\quad (\\text{Negative, invalid})\n  \\]\n- **Option C (\\( k = 3 \\)):**\n  \\[\n  D = 25 - 4(3) = 25 - 12 = 13 \\quad (\\text{Positive, valid})\n  \\]\n- **Option D (\\( k = 8 \\)):**\n  \\[\n  D = 25 - 4(8) = 25 - 32 = -7 \\quad (\\text{Negative, invalid})\n  \\]\n- **Option E (\\( k = 12 \\)):**\n  \\[\n  D = 25 - 4(12) = 25 - 48 = -23 \\quad (\\text{Negative, invalid})\n  \\]\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nAmong the given options, only \\( k = 3 \\) (Option C) results in a positive discriminant, ensuring two real and distinct roots.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this quadratic equation problem here. The question is asking for the largest integer value of 'k' such that the equation x\u00b2 -5x +k = 0 has two real and distinct roots. Hmm, I remember that for a quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, the discriminant plays a key role in determining the nature of the roots.\n\nWait, the discriminant formula is D = b\u00b2 - 4ac. Right. And for the equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be greater than zero. So D > 0.\n\nLet me plug in the values from the given equation. Here, a is 1, b is -5, and c is k. So substituting these into the discriminant formula: D = (-5)\u00b2 - 4*(1)*(k). That simplifies to 25 - 4k.\n\nSo for the roots to be real and distinct, 25 - 4k > 0. Let me solve this inequality. 25 -4k >0. Subtract 25 from both sides, wait no, better to rearrange: -4k > -25. Hmm, but when I divide both sides by a negative number, the inequality sign flips. So dividing both sides by -4, I get k < 25/4.\n\nWait, 25 divided by 4 is 6.25. So k must be less than 6.25. But the question asks for the largest integral value of k. So the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. But wait, looking at the options, I don't see 6 as an option. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Oh, none of these are 6. Hmm, did I make a mistake? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, wait. Did I get the equation right? The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant D = (-5)^2 -4*1*k =25 -4k. So the condition is 25-4k >0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k < 25/4 \u2192 6.25. So the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6.\n\nBut the options don't have 6. So maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nWait, the question says \"integral value of k\". So the possible choices are integers. The options given are 9,7,3,8,12. All of these are larger than 6.25 except perhaps 3, which is less. Wait, but 7 is larger than 6.25. So if I pick k=7, then D=25 -4*7=25-28= -3. Which is negative, so no real roots. So k=7 is too big.\n\nSimilarly, k=8: D=25-32= -7, which is also negative.\n\nk=9: 25-36=-11, negative.\n\nk=3: 25-12=13, positive. So that's okay. So the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6, but it's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the discriminant formula. Let me recheck. The quadratic is x\u00b2 -5x +k. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac = (-5)^2 -4(1)(k) =25-4k. That's correct.\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the largest integral k where the equation has real and distinct roots. So k must be less than 6.25. So the largest integer less than that is 6. But 6 isn't an option. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nHmm, none of these are 6. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, could the quadratic be written differently? Like maybe it's x\u00b2 +5x +k, but no, the question says x\u00b2-5x +k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the equation has two real roots, which could be equal or distinct. But the question specifies distinct, so discriminant must be positive.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the options. The options given are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. So the correct value is 6, which is not in the options. That suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, could the quadratic be x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, and I need to find the maximum integer k such that the equation has two real roots. So, the maximum k where D >0 is k <6.25, so k=6 is the maximum integer. But since 6 isn't an option, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the discriminant. Let me compute 25-4k for each option and see which is the largest k where 25-4k is positive.\n\nLet's test each option:\n\nOption A: k=9 \u2192 D=25-36= -11 \u2192 negative. So no real roots.\n\nOption B: k=7 \u2192 D=25-28= -3 \u2192 negative.\n\nOption C: k=3 \u2192 D=25-12=13 \u2192 positive. So two real roots.\n\nOption D: k=8 \u2192 D=25-32= -7 \u2192 negative.\n\nOption E: k=12 \u2192 D=25-48= -23 \u2192 negative.\n\nSo only option C (k=3) gives a positive discriminant. But wait, the question is asking for the largest integral value of k. So in the options, the largest possible k that still gives D>0 is 3. Because the next higher option is 7, which gives D negative. So in the given options, the maximum is 3.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"largest integral value of k\", so the maximum possible k is 6.25, but since 6 isn't an option, the next possible is 6, but that's not there. So perhaps the answer is 6, but since it's not an option, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I read the question wrong. Let me read again. The question is asking for the largest integral value of k for which the equation has two real and distinct roots. So the possible options are the given choices.\n\nIn the options, the only k that works is 3, because 7,8,9,12 all give D negative, and 3 gives D positive. So the largest among the options is 3. So the correct answer is C)3.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The problem says \"the largest integral value of 'k'\", which is possible. But among the options, 3 is the only one that works. So the answer must be option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this quadratic equation problem here. The question is asking for the largest integer value of 'k' such that the equation x\u00b2 -5x +k = 0 has two real and distinct roots. Hmm, I remember that for a quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, the discriminant plays a key role in determining the nature of the roots.\n\nWait, the discriminant formula is D = b\u00b2 - 4ac. Right. And for the equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be greater than zero. So D > 0.\n\nLet me plug in the values from the given equation. Here, a is 1, b is -5, and c is k. So substituting these into the discriminant formula: D = (-5)\u00b2 - 4*(1)*(k). That simplifies to 25 - 4k.\n\nSo for the roots to be real and distinct, 25 - 4k > 0. Let me solve this inequality. 25 -4k >0. Subtract 25 from both sides, wait no, better to rearrange: -4k > -25. Hmm, but when I divide both sides by a negative number, the inequality sign flips. So dividing both sides by -4, I get k < 25/4.\n\nWait, 25 divided by 4 is 6.25. So k must be less than 6.25. But the question asks for the largest integral value of k. So the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. But wait, looking at the options, I don't see 6 as an option. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Oh, none of these are 6. Hmm, did I make a mistake? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, wait. Did I get the equation right? The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant D = (-5)^2 -4*1*k =25 -4k. So the condition is 25-4k >0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k < 25/4 \u2192 6.25. So the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6.\n\nBut the options don't have 6. So maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nWait, the question says \"integral value of k\". So the possible choices are integers. The options given are 9,7,3,8,12. All of these are larger than 6.25 except perhaps 3, which is less. Wait, but 7 is larger than 6.25. So if I pick k=7, then D=25 -4*7=25-28= -3. Which is negative, so no real roots. So k=7 is too big.\n\nSimilarly, k=8: D=25-32= -7, which is also negative.\n\nk=9: 25-36=-11, negative.\n\nk=3: 25-12=13, positive. So that's okay. So the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6, but it's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the discriminant formula. Let me recheck. The quadratic is x\u00b2 -5x +k. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac = (-5)^2 -4(1)(k) =25-4k. That's correct.\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the largest integral k where the equation has real and distinct roots. So k must be less than 6.25. So the largest integer less than that is 6. But 6 isn't an option. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nHmm, none of these are 6. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, could the quadratic be written differently? Like maybe it's x\u00b2 +5x +k, but no, the question says x\u00b2-5x +k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the equation has two real roots, which could be equal or distinct. But the question specifies distinct, so discriminant must be positive.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the options. The options given are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. So the correct value is 6, which is not in the options. That suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, could the quadratic be x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, and I need to find the maximum integer k such that the equation has two real roots. So, the maximum k where D >0 is k <6.25, so k=6 is the maximum integer. But since 6 isn't an option, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the discriminant. Let me compute 25-4k for each option and see which is the largest k where 25-4k is positive.\n\nLet's test each option:\n\nOption A: k=9 \u2192 D=25-36= -11 \u2192 negative. So no real roots.\n\nOption B: k=7 \u2192 D=25-28= -3 \u2192 negative.\n\nOption C: k=3 \u2192 D=25-12=13 \u2192 positive. So two real roots.\n\nOption D: k=8 \u2192 D=25-32= -7 \u2192 negative.\n\nOption E: k=12 \u2192 D=25-48= -23 \u2192 negative.\n\nSo only option C (k=3) gives a positive discriminant. But wait, the question is asking for the largest integral value of k. So in the options, the largest possible k that still gives D>0 is 3. Because the next higher option is 7, which gives D negative. So in the given options, the maximum is 3.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"largest integral value of k\", so the maximum possible k is 6.25, but since 6 isn't an option, the next possible is 6, but that's not there. So perhaps the answer is 6, but since it's not an option, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I read the question wrong. Let me read again. The question is asking for the largest integral value of k for which the equation has two real and distinct roots. So the possible options are the given choices.\n\nIn the options, the only k that works is 3, because 7,8,9,12 all give D negative, and 3 gives D positive. So the largest among the options is 3. So the correct answer is C)3.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The problem says \"the largest integral value of 'k'\", which is possible. But among the options, 3 is the only one that works. So the answer must be option C.\n\n\nTo determine the largest integral value of \\( k \\) for which the quadratic equation \\( x^2 - 5x + k = 0 \\) has two real and distinct roots, we analyze the discriminant of the quadratic equation. For a general quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the discriminant is given by:\n\n\\[\nD = b^2 - 4ac\n\\]\n\nFor the equation \\( x^2 - 5x + k = 0 \\), the coefficients are \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -5 \\), and \\( c = k \\). Substituting these into the discriminant formula:\n\n\\[\nD = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(k) = 25 - 4k\n\\]\n\nFor the equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must satisfy \\( D > 0 \\). Thus:\n\n\\[\n25 - 4k > 0\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( k \\):\n\n\\[\n25 - 4k > 0 \\implies 4k < 25 \\implies k < \\frac{25}{4} = 6.25\n\\]\n\nThe largest integer less than \\( 6.25 \\) is \\( 6 \\). However, \\( 6 \\) is not among the given options. To verify, we test the given options to determine which is the largest value of \\( k \\) that satisfies \\( D > 0 \\):\n\n- **Option A (\\( k = 9 \\))**: \\( D = 25 - 4(9) = 25 - 36 = -11 \\) (negative, no real roots).\n- **Option B (\\( k = 7 \\))**: \\( D = 25 - 4(7) = 25 - 28 = -3 \\) (negative, no real roots).\n- **Option C (\\( k = 3 \\))**: \\( D = 25 - 4(3) = 25 - 12 = 13 \\) (positive, two real roots).\n- **Option D (\\( k = 8 \\))**: \\( D = 25 - 4(8) = 25 - 32 = -7 \\) (negative, no real roots).\n- **Option E (\\( k = 12 \\))**: \\( D = 25 - 4(12) = 25 - 48 = -23 \\) (negative, no real roots).\n\nAmong the options, only \\( k = 3 \\) satisfies \\( D > 0 \\).

The question is asking for the largest integer value of 'k' such that the equation x\u00b2 -5x +k =0 has two real and distinct roots. Hmm, I remember that for a quadratic equation ax\u00b2 +bx +c =0, the discriminant determines the nature of the roots. The discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. Oh right, if the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots. If it's zero, one real root, and if negative, complex roots.\n\nSo, in this equation, a is 1, b is -5, and c is k. Let me plug these into the discriminant formula. So discriminant D = (-5)\u00b2 -4*1*k. That's 25 minus 4k. \n\nWait, the problem says two real and distinct roots, which means the discriminant has to be greater than zero. So 25 -4k >0. Let's solve this inequality for k. \n\n25 -4k >0 \u2192 -4k > -25. Hmm, when I divide both sides by a negative number, I remember that the inequality sign flips. So dividing both sides by -4 gives k < 25/4. What's 25 divided by 4? That's 6.25. Oh, so k must be less than 6.25.\n\nBut the question is asking for the largest integral value of k. So the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. But wait, looking at the options, I don't see 6 as an option. Let me check the options again. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Oh, wait, none of these is 6. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, maybe I misread the equation. Let me double-check. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. Oh, wait, no, that's correct. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant is 25-4k. So 25-4k>0 \u2192 k <6.25. So the largest integer is 6. But 6 isn't an option. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the sign when solving the inequality. Let me recheck. 25-4k>0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k<25/4, which is 6.25. So yes, that's correct.\n\nLooking at the options again, the options are 3,7,8,9,12. All are higher than 6.25 except maybe none. So none of the options are correct? But that can't be. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I got the equation wrong. Let me make sure. The equation is x squared minus 5x plus k equals zero. So a is 1, b is -5, c is k. So discriminant is (-5)^2 -4*(1)*(k) \u2192 25-4k. Right.\n\nSo if k has to be less than 6.25, the largest integer is 6. But the options don't have 6. Did I misread the question? Let me read again: largest integral value of k. So perhaps the options have a typo or I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking at the options, the largest possible k less than 6.25 is 6, but since that's not an option, perhaps I should reevaluate. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the discriminant.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the equation is written differently. Wait, is it x squared minus 5x plus k equals zero? Yes, that's correct. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So D is 25-4k.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if the options are correct. Because none of the options are less than 6.25 except for 3. Wait, 3 is an option (option C), but that's not the largest possible. Wait, perhaps I should check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the question. Maybe the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. Wait, no, that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the question is to find the maximum value of k for which the equation has real roots, which is correct as 6.25. So the maximum integer less than that is 6. But 6 isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I should recompute. 25-4k>0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k <6.25. So k can be 6.24 or anything less. So the largest integer is 6.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are wrong, or I'm looking at the wrong problem. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me try plugging in the options to see if any of them satisfy D>0.\n\nLet's check each option:\n\nOption A: k=9. D=25-4*9=25-36= -11. Negative, so no real roots.\n\nOption B: k=7. D=25-28= -3. Still negative.\n\nOption C: k=3. D=25-12=13>0. So yes, two real roots.\n\nOption D: k=8. D=25-32= -7. Negative.\n\nOption E: k=12. D=25-48= -23. Negative.\n\nSo only option C (k=3) gives a positive discriminant. So the equation would have two real roots only when k is less than 6.25. So the largest integer k is 6. But since 6 isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer is 6, but that's not available. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the equation. Let me double-check. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So D is b\u00b2-4ac=25-4k.\n\nSo D>0 \u2192 25-4k>0 \u2192 4k<25 \u2192k<6.25. So maximum integer k is 6.\n\nBut since 6 isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options. But that's not possible because the options are given. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So perhaps I should recheck.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Then discriminant would be 25-4k. But that's not the case here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me see: b is -5, so b squared is 25. 4ac is 4*1*k=4k. So D=25-4k.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, looking back at the options, only option C (k=3) gives D=13>0, which is acceptable. But the question is asking for the largest possible integer k. So if 6 is not an option, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the equation as x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So let's check for k=6: D=25-24=1>0. So yes, two real roots. For k=7: D=25-28= -3<0. So no.\n\nBut the options don't have 6. So maybe the intended answer is 6, but it's not in the options. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the question.\n\nWait, the question says \"integral value of k\". So perhaps the options are incorrect, but in the given options, the largest k that works is 3. But that's not the largest. Wait, but in the options, only 3 works. So perhaps the correct answer is 3, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, 3 is much smaller than 6.25. So why would the largest possible k be 3 when 6 is possible? So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equation is written differently. Let me read the problem again: \"quadratic equation x\u00b2 -5x +k=0\". So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So D=25-4k.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the smallest k, not the largest. But no, the question says the largest integral value.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should consider that the options are correct and I made a mistake. Let me see. If the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the discriminant. Let me try again.\n\nD = b\u00b2 -4ac. Here, a=1, b=-5, c=k. So D= (-5)^2 -4*(1)*(k) \u2192 25 -4k. So D must be >0.\n\nSo 25-4k>0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k<6.25.\n\nSo the maximum integer k is 6. But none of the options are 6. So perhaps the problem was written incorrectly, or I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Then D=25-4k. Same as before. So same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x -k=0. Then D=25 +4k. Then 25+4k>0 \u2192 4k> -25 \u2192 k> -6.25. So any positive k would work, but the question would be different.\n\nBut in the problem, the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0.\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but in the options given, option C (k=3) is the only one that satisfies D>0. So that's the only correct option.\n\nWait, but that can't be. Because if the options are given, perhaps the intended answer is 6, but it's not present. So maybe I made a mistake in the discriminant.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think again. Maybe the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. D=25-4k.\n\nSo for D>0, k<6.25. So the largest integer is 6. But the options don't have 6. So perhaps the correct answer is 6, but it's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the largest k such that the equation has real and equal roots. In that case, D=0 \u2192 25-4k=0 \u2192 k=25/4=6.25. But the question specifies two real and distinct roots, so D>0.\n\nSo given that, and the options, perhaps the answer is 6, but it's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, 3, but that's not the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should check the options again.\n\nWait, the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nOnly option C (3) gives a positive discriminant. So perhaps the correct answer is 3. But that can't be because 6 is larger and works. But since 6 is not an option, maybe the correct answer is 3. But that would be wrong because 3 is smaller than 6.25, but the question asks for the largest possible k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is to find the minimum k for which the equation has two real roots. Then 3 would be correct, but that's not what the question is asking.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to reevaluate.\n\nThe correct maximum k is 6, but the options don't have 6. So perhaps the problem has a typo. But in the given options, the only one that works is 3. So perhaps the correct answer is 3. But that doesn't make sense because 6 is larger and works.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are wrong. But I have to choose from the given options. So looking back, the only option that gives a positive discriminant is C)3. So the answer must be option C.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me compute D for k=6: D=25-24=1>0. So yes. For k=7: D=25-28=-3 <0. So 7 doesn't work. So the largest k in the options that works is 3. But that's not correct because 6 isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is reversed. Maybe it's asking for the smallest k. But no, the question says largest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation. Maybe the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. Oh wait, that's what I thought. So I think the correct answer is 6, but it's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is not provided. But since the options are given, perhaps the intended answer is 3. But that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should recheck the discriminant formula. D = b\u00b2 -4ac. So for equation x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, D=25 -4k. Correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is to find the maximum k for which the equation has real roots, which would be 6.25. But since k must be integral, the maximum is 6. So perhaps the correct answer isn't in the options. But the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reevaluate the problem. Maybe I'm missing something else. Wait, perhaps the question is about the product of roots, but no, the question is about real and distinct roots.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is written as x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Then D=25-4k. So same as before. So same conclusion.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the equation is written as x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, but with a different a, b, or c. No, that's correct.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the largest integer k is 6, but it's not among the options. The only option that works is 3, but that's not the largest possible. So perhaps the intended answer is 3, but I think that's incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just look at the options and see which is the largest value less than 6.25. The options are 3,7,8,9,12. None are less than 6.25 except 3. So the only possible correct option is C)3.\n\nBut that's not the largest possible. So perhaps the answer is 3, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the question has a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, but maybe I should check for k=6.25. But that's not integral. So the largest integer is 6.\n\nSince 6 isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But since I have to choose from the options, perhaps the answer is 3. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are correct, and I'm wrong. Let me try to compute for each option:\n\nOption A: k=9 \u2192 D=25-36= -11 <0 \u2192 no real roots.\n\nOption B: k=7 \u2192 D=25-28= -3 <0 \u2192 no.\n\nOption C: k=3 \u2192 D=25-12=13>0 \u2192 yes.\n\nOption D: k=8 \u2192 D=25-32= -7 <0 \u2192 no.\n\nOption E: k=12 \u2192 D=25-48= -23 <0 \u2192 no.\n\nSo only option C gives a positive discriminant. So the equation has two real roots only when k=3. But the question is asking for the largest possible k, which would be 6. But since 6 isn't an option, the only correct option is C)3.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Because the problem is asking for the largest k, and among the options, 3 is the only one that works. So the answer must be C)3.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this quadratic equation problem here. The question is asking for the largest integer value of 'k' such that the equation x\u00b2 -5x +k =0 has two real and distinct roots. Hmm, I remember that for a quadratic equation ax\u00b2 +bx +c =0, the discriminant determines the nature of the roots. The discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. Oh right, if the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots. If it's zero, one real root, and if negative, complex roots.\n\nSo, in this equation, a is 1, b is -5, and c is k. Let me plug these into the discriminant formula. So discriminant D = (-5)\u00b2 -4*1*k. That's 25 minus 4k. \n\nWait, the problem says two real and distinct roots, which means the discriminant has to be greater than zero. So 25 -4k >0. Let's solve this inequality for k. \n\n25 -4k >0 \u2192 -4k > -25. Hmm, when I divide both sides by a negative number, I remember that the inequality sign flips. So dividing both sides by -4 gives k < 25/4. What's 25 divided by 4? That's 6.25. Oh, so k must be less than 6.25.\n\nBut the question is asking for the largest integral value of k. So the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. But wait, looking at the options, I don't see 6 as an option. Let me check the options again. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Oh, wait, none of these is 6. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, maybe I misread the equation. Let me double-check. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. Oh, wait, no, that's correct. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant is 25-4k. So 25-4k>0 \u2192 k <6.25. So the largest integer is 6. But 6 isn't an option. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the sign when solving the inequality. Let me recheck. 25-4k>0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k<25/4, which is 6.25. So yes, that's correct.\n\nLooking at the options again, the options are 3,7,8,9,12. All are higher than 6.25 except maybe none. So none of the options are correct? But that can't be. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I got the equation wrong. Let me make sure. The equation is x squared minus 5x plus k equals zero. So a is 1, b is -5, c is k. So discriminant is (-5)^2 -4*(1)*(k) \u2192 25-4k. Right.\n\nSo if k has to be less than 6.25, the largest integer is 6. But the options don't have 6. Did I misread the question? Let me read again: largest integral value of k. So perhaps the options have a typo or I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking at the options, the largest possible k less than 6.25 is 6, but since that's not an option, perhaps I should reevaluate. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the discriminant.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the equation is written differently. Wait, is it x squared minus 5x plus k equals zero? Yes, that's correct. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So D is 25-4k.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if the options are correct. Because none of the options are less than 6.25 except for 3. Wait, 3 is an option (option C), but that's not the largest possible. Wait, perhaps I should check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the question. Maybe the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. Wait, no, that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the question is to find the maximum value of k for which the equation has real roots, which is correct as 6.25. So the maximum integer less than that is 6. But 6 isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I should recompute. 25-4k>0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k <6.25. So k can be 6.24 or anything less. So the largest integer is 6.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are wrong, or I'm looking at the wrong problem. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me try plugging in the options to see if any of them satisfy D>0.\n\nLet's check each option:\n\nOption A: k=9. D=25-4*9=25-36= -11. Negative, so no real roots.\n\nOption B: k=7. D=25-28= -3. Still negative.\n\nOption C: k=3. D=25-12=13>0. So yes, two real roots.\n\nOption D: k=8. D=25-32= -7. Negative.\n\nOption E: k=12. D=25-48= -23. Negative.\n\nSo only option C (k=3) gives a positive discriminant. So the equation would have two real roots only when k is less than 6.25. So the largest integer k is 6. But since 6 isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer is 6, but that's not available. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the equation. Let me double-check. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So D is b\u00b2-4ac=25-4k.\n\nSo D>0 \u2192 25-4k>0 \u2192 4k<25 \u2192k<6.25. So maximum integer k is 6.\n\nBut since 6 isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options. But that's not possible because the options are given. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So perhaps I should recheck.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Then discriminant would be 25-4k. But that's not the case here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me see: b is -5, so b squared is 25. 4ac is 4*1*k=4k. So D=25-4k.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, looking back at the options, only option C (k=3) gives D=13>0, which is acceptable. But the question is asking for the largest possible integer k. So if 6 is not an option, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the equation as x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So let's check for k=6: D=25-24=1>0. So yes, two real roots. For k=7: D=25-28= -3<0. So no.\n\nBut the options don't have 6. So maybe the intended answer is 6, but it's not in the options. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the question.\n\nWait, the question says \"integral value of k\". So perhaps the options are incorrect, but in the given options, the largest k that works is 3. But that's not the largest. Wait, but in the options, only 3 works. So perhaps the correct answer is 3, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, 3 is much smaller than 6.25. So why would the largest possible k be 3 when 6 is possible? So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equation is written differently. Let me read the problem again: \"quadratic equation x\u00b2 -5x +k=0\". So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So D=25-4k.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the smallest k, not the largest. But no, the question says the largest integral value.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should consider that the options are correct and I made a mistake. Let me see. If the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the discriminant. Let me try again.\n\nD = b\u00b2 -4ac. Here, a=1, b=-5, c=k. So D= (-5)^2 -4*(1)*(k) \u2192 25 -4k. So D must be >0.\n\nSo 25-4k>0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k<6.25.\n\nSo the maximum integer k is 6. But none of the options are 6. So perhaps the problem was written incorrectly, or I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Then D=25-4k. Same as before. So same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x -k=0. Then D=25 +4k. Then 25+4k>0 \u2192 4k> -25 \u2192 k> -6.25. So any positive k would work, but the question would be different.\n\nBut in the problem, the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0.\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but in the options given, option C (k=3) is the only one that satisfies D>0. So that's the only correct option.\n\nWait, but that can't be. Because if the options are given, perhaps the intended answer is 6, but it's not present. So maybe I made a mistake in the discriminant.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think again. Maybe the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. D=25-4k.\n\nSo for D>0, k<6.25. So the largest integer is 6. But the options don't have 6. So perhaps the correct answer is 6, but it's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the largest k such that the equation has real and equal roots. In that case, D=0 \u2192 25-4k=0 \u2192 k=25/4=6.25. But the question specifies two real and distinct roots, so D>0.\n\nSo given that, and the options, perhaps the answer is 6, but it's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, 3, but that's not the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should check the options again.\n\nWait, the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nOnly option C (3) gives a positive discriminant. So perhaps the correct answer is 3. But that can't be because 6 is larger and works. But since 6 is not an option, maybe the correct answer is 3. But that would be wrong because 3 is smaller than 6.25, but the question asks for the largest possible k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is to find the minimum k for which the equation has two real roots. Then 3 would be correct, but that's not what the question is asking.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to reevaluate.\n\nThe correct maximum k is 6, but the options don't have 6. So perhaps the problem has a typo. But in the given options, the only one that works is 3. So perhaps the correct answer is 3. But that doesn't make sense because 6 is larger and works.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are wrong. But I have to choose from the given options. So looking back, the only option that gives a positive discriminant is C)3. So the answer must be option C.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me compute D for k=6: D=25-24=1>0. So yes. For k=7: D=25-28=-3 <0. So 7 doesn't work. So the largest k in the options that works is 3. But that's not correct because 6 isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is reversed. Maybe it's asking for the smallest k. But no, the question says largest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation. Maybe the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. Oh wait, that's what I thought. So I think the correct answer is 6, but it's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is not provided. But since the options are given, perhaps the intended answer is 3. But that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should recheck the discriminant formula. D = b\u00b2 -4ac. So for equation x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, D=25 -4k. Correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is to find the maximum k for which the equation has real roots, which would be 6.25. But since k must be integral, the maximum is 6. So perhaps the correct answer isn't in the options. But the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reevaluate the problem. Maybe I'm missing something else. Wait, perhaps the question is about the product of roots, but no, the question is about real and distinct roots.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is written as x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Then D=25-4k. So same as before. So same conclusion.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the equation is written as x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, but with a different a, b, or c. No, that's correct.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the largest integer k is 6, but it's not among the options. The only option that works is 3, but that's not the largest possible. So perhaps the intended answer is 3, but I think that's incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just look at the options and see which is the largest value less than 6.25. The options are 3,7,8,9,12. None are less than 6.25 except 3. So the only possible correct option is C)3.\n\nBut that's not the largest possible. So perhaps the answer is 3, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the question has a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, but maybe I should check for k=6.25. But that's not integral. So the largest integer is 6.\n\nSince 6 isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But since I have to choose from the options, perhaps the answer is 3. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are correct, and I'm wrong. Let me try to compute for each option:\n\nOption A: k=9 \u2192 D=25-36= -11 <0 \u2192 no real roots.\n\nOption B: k=7 \u2192 D=25-28= -3 <0 \u2192 no.\n\nOption C: k=3 \u2192 D=25-12=13>0 \u2192 yes.\n\nOption D: k=8 \u2192 D=25-32= -7 <0 \u2192 no.\n\nOption E: k=12 \u2192 D=25-48= -23 <0 \u2192 no.\n\nSo only option C gives a positive discriminant. So the equation has two real roots only when k=3. But the question is asking for the largest possible k, which would be 6. But since 6 isn't an option, the only correct option is C)3.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Because the problem is asking for the largest k, and among the options, 3 is the only one that works. So the answer must be C)3.\n\n\nTo determine the largest integral value of \\( k \\) for which the quadratic equation \\( x^2 - 5x + k = 0 \\) has two real and distinct roots, we analyze the discriminant of the quadratic equation. For a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the discriminant is given by \\( D = b^2 - 4ac \\). If \\( D > 0 \\), the equation has two real and distinct roots.\n\n### Step 1: Identify coefficients and compute the discriminant\nFor the given equation \\( x^2 - 5x + k = 0 \\):\n- \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -5 \\), and \\( c = k \\).\n- The discriminant is:\n  \\[\n  D = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(k) = 25 - 4k.\n  \\]\n\n### Step 2: Set the discriminant greater than zero\nFor two real and distinct roots, \\( D > 0 \\):\n\\[\n25 - 4k > 0.\n\\]\nSolving for \\( k \\):\n\\[\n4k < 25 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad k < \\frac{25}{4} = 6.25.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Determine the largest integral value of \\( k \\)\nThe largest integer less than \\( 6.25 \\) is \\( 6 \\). However, \\( 6 \\) is not among the provided options. Therefore, we must evaluate the given options to find the largest value of \\( k \\) that satisfies \\( D > 0 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate each option\n- **Option A (\\( k = 9 \\))**: \n  \\[\n  D = 25 - 4(9) = 25 - 36 = -11 \\quad (\\text{Negative, no real roots}).\n  \\]\n- **Option B (\\( k = 7 \\))**: \n  \\[\n  D = 25 - 4(7) = 25 - 28 = -3 \\quad (\\text{Negative, no real roots}).\n  \\]\n- **Option C (\\( k = 3 \\))**: \n  \\[\n  D = 25 - 4(3) = 25 - 12 = 13 \\quad (\\text{Positive, two real roots}).\n  \\]\n- **Option D (\\( k = 8 \\))**: \n  \\[\n  D = 25 - 4(8) = 25 - 32 = -7 \\quad (\\text{Negative, no real roots}).\n  \\]\n- **Option E (\\( k = 12 \\))**: \n  \\[\n  D = 25 - 4(12) = 25 - 48 = -23 \\quad (\\text{Negative, no real roots}).\n  \\]\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nAmong the given options, only \\( k = 3 \\) (Option C) results in a positive discriminant, ensuring two real and distinct roots.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quadratic equation question here. Let me read it again. The question is asking for the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x\u00b2 -5x +k =0 will have two real and distinct roots. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nHmm, I remember that for a quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c =0, the discriminant determines the nature of the roots. The discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. Right, so if the discriminant is positive, the equation has two distinct real roots. If it's zero, the roots are equal, and if it's negative, the roots are complex or imaginary.\n\nSo in this case, the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. Comparing it to the standard form, a is 1, b is -5, and c is k.\n\nLet me write down the discriminant: D = b\u00b2 -4ac. Plugging in the values, that would be (-5)\u00b2 -4*(1)*k. So that's 25 -4k.\n\nWait, for two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be greater than zero. So 25 -4k > 0. Let me solve that inequality.\n\n25 -4k >0\n=> -4k > -25\nHmm, when I divide both sides by a negative number, I have to reverse the inequality sign. So dividing both sides by -4, I get:\nk < 25/4.\n\nWait, 25 divided by 4 is 6.25. So k must be less than 6.25. But the question is asking for the largest integral value of k. So the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6, right? Because 6.25 is equal to 6 and a quarter, so the next integer below is 6.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options given, the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Oh wait, none of these is 6. Did I do something wrong?\n\nWait, let me double-check. The discriminant is 25 -4k. So 25-4k >0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k <25/4. 25/4 is 6.25, correct. So the maximum integer k is 6. But in the options, the highest number below 6.25 would be 6, but it's not an option here.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the discriminant. Wait, a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant is (-5)^2 -4*(1)*k =25 -4k. Right. So 25-4k>0 \u2192 4k<25 \u2192 k<6.25. So maximum integer is 6. But the options don't have 6.\n\nLooking at the options, the next lower integer is 5, but again, it's not an option. Wait, the options are 3,7,8,9,12. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I have to find k such that the quadratic equation has two real roots, but perhaps I missed something. Let me think again.\n\nWait, wait, no. The discriminant is correct. So, 25-4k >0. So k must be less than 6.25. So the maximum integer is 6. But none of the options is 6. So perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, the options given are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. So the highest of these that is less than 6.25 would be 3, 7 is higher than 6.25, so 3 is the next but wait, 3 is way lower. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong condition. Let me think. Wait, the question says 'two real and distinct roots'. So the discriminant must be positive. So k must be less than 6.25. So the largest integer k is 6, which is not in the options. So maybe the options are incorrect or I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated something. Let me check again.\n\nWait, discriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac. So for the equation x\u00b2 -5x +k, a=1, b=-5, c=k. So D = (-5)^2 -4*(1)*(k) =25-4k. So yes, 25-4k>0 \u2192 k<6.25.\n\nSo the maximum integer k is 6. But none of the options is 6. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But that can't be, so maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about the integral value of k, but perhaps I have to see which option is the largest possible and less than 6.25. Looking at the options, the numbers are 3,7,8,9,12. All of these are larger than 6.25 except 3. So the only option less than 6.25 is 3. But 3 is option C. But 3 is not the largest. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, wait, the question says 'the largest integral value of k' such that the equation has two real and distinct roots. So if k must be less than 6.25, the largest integer is 6. But since 6 isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe I got the inequality wrong. Let me re-calculate the discriminant condition.\n\nSo, D =25 -4k >0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k<6.25. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the quadratic equation. Let me check the equation again. Oh, the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So the discriminant is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find the maximum integer k for which D is positive. So 6 is the maximum. But in the options, the largest number less than 6.25 is 6, but it's not present. So perhaps the options are incorrect, or perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again, option C is 3, which is less than 6.25, but 3 is not the largest possible. So perhaps the correct answer is not in the options. But that can't be the case because it's a multiple-choice question.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant. Let me compute D again. So for equation x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, a=1, b=-5, c=k. So D = (-5)^2 -4*(1)*(k) = 25 -4k. So that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the question was written differently. Oh, wait! Wait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, so maybe I read it wrong. No, that's what I thought.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused because none of the options match. Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the question again. The question is, what's the largest integral value of k for two real and distinct roots.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the possible options. Let's take each option and compute the discriminant to see if it's positive.\n\nOption A: k=9 \u2192 D=25-4*9=25-36= -11. Negative, so roots are complex. So not acceptable.\n\nOption B: k=7 \u2192 D=25-28= -3. Also negative. So no.\n\nOption C: k=3 \u2192 D=25-12=13>0. So yes, acceptable.\n\nOption D: k=8 \u2192 D=25-32= -7. Negative. Not acceptable.\n\nOption E: k=12 \u2192 D=25-48= -23. Negative.\n\nSo the only option that gives a positive discriminant is C)3. So the largest k among the options that makes D positive is 3.\n\nBut wait, according to my earlier calculation, the maximum k is 6.25, so any k less than that would work. So 3 is acceptable, but so are 4,5,6. But since the options don't have 6, the next lower is 5, but that's also not in the options. So the highest possible option that's less than 6.25 is 3. So the correct answer is C)3.\n\nBut wait, that seems a bit odd because 3 is the only option that works. So the answer must be C)3.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quadratic equation question here. Let me read it again. The question is asking for the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x\u00b2 -5x +k =0 will have two real and distinct roots. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nHmm, I remember that for a quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c =0, the discriminant determines the nature of the roots. The discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. Right, so if the discriminant is positive, the equation has two distinct real roots. If it's zero, the roots are equal, and if it's negative, the roots are complex or imaginary.\n\nSo in this case, the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. Comparing it to the standard form, a is 1, b is -5, and c is k.\n\nLet me write down the discriminant: D = b\u00b2 -4ac. Plugging in the values, that would be (-5)\u00b2 -4*(1)*k. So that's 25 -4k.\n\nWait, for two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be greater than zero. So 25 -4k > 0. Let me solve that inequality.\n\n25 -4k >0\n=> -4k > -25\nHmm, when I divide both sides by a negative number, I have to reverse the inequality sign. So dividing both sides by -4, I get:\nk < 25/4.\n\nWait, 25 divided by 4 is 6.25. So k must be less than 6.25. But the question is asking for the largest integral value of k. So the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6, right? Because 6.25 is equal to 6 and a quarter, so the next integer below is 6.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options given, the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Oh wait, none of these is 6. Did I do something wrong?\n\nWait, let me double-check. The discriminant is 25 -4k. So 25-4k >0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k <25/4. 25/4 is 6.25, correct. So the maximum integer k is 6. But in the options, the highest number below 6.25 would be 6, but it's not an option here.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the discriminant. Wait, a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant is (-5)^2 -4*(1)*k =25 -4k. Right. So 25-4k>0 \u2192 4k<25 \u2192 k<6.25. So maximum integer is 6. But the options don't have 6.\n\nLooking at the options, the next lower integer is 5, but again, it's not an option. Wait, the options are 3,7,8,9,12. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I have to find k such that the quadratic equation has two real roots, but perhaps I missed something. Let me think again.\n\nWait, wait, no. The discriminant is correct. So, 25-4k >0. So k must be less than 6.25. So the maximum integer is 6. But none of the options is 6. So perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, the options given are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. So the highest of these that is less than 6.25 would be 3, 7 is higher than 6.25, so 3 is the next but wait, 3 is way lower. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong condition. Let me think. Wait, the question says 'two real and distinct roots'. So the discriminant must be positive. So k must be less than 6.25. So the largest integer k is 6, which is not in the options. So maybe the options are incorrect or I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated something. Let me check again.\n\nWait, discriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac. So for the equation x\u00b2 -5x +k, a=1, b=-5, c=k. So D = (-5)^2 -4*(1)*(k) =25-4k. So yes, 25-4k>0 \u2192 k<6.25.\n\nSo the maximum integer k is 6. But none of the options is 6. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But that can't be, so maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about the integral value of k, but perhaps I have to see which option is the largest possible and less than 6.25. Looking at the options, the numbers are 3,7,8,9,12. All of these are larger than 6.25 except 3. So the only option less than 6.25 is 3. But 3 is option C. But 3 is not the largest. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, wait, the question says 'the largest integral value of k' such that the equation has two real and distinct roots. So if k must be less than 6.25, the largest integer is 6. But since 6 isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe I got the inequality wrong. Let me re-calculate the discriminant condition.\n\nSo, D =25 -4k >0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k<6.25. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the quadratic equation. Let me check the equation again. Oh, the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So the discriminant is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find the maximum integer k for which D is positive. So 6 is the maximum. But in the options, the largest number less than 6.25 is 6, but it's not present. So perhaps the options are incorrect, or perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again, option C is 3, which is less than 6.25, but 3 is not the largest possible. So perhaps the correct answer is not in the options. But that can't be the case because it's a multiple-choice question.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant. Let me compute D again. So for equation x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, a=1, b=-5, c=k. So D = (-5)^2 -4*(1)*(k) = 25 -4k. So that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the question was written differently. Oh, wait! Wait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, so maybe I read it wrong. No, that's what I thought.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused because none of the options match. Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the question again. The question is, what's the largest integral value of k for two real and distinct roots.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the possible options. Let's take each option and compute the discriminant to see if it's positive.\n\nOption A: k=9 \u2192 D=25-4*9=25-36= -11. Negative, so roots are complex. So not acceptable.\n\nOption B: k=7 \u2192 D=25-28= -3. Also negative. So no.\n\nOption C: k=3 \u2192 D=25-12=13>0. So yes, acceptable.\n\nOption D: k=8 \u2192 D=25-32= -7. Negative. Not acceptable.\n\nOption E: k=12 \u2192 D=25-48= -23. Negative.\n\nSo the only option that gives a positive discriminant is C)3. So the largest k among the options that makes D positive is 3.\n\nBut wait, according to my earlier calculation, the maximum k is 6.25, so any k less than that would work. So 3 is acceptable, but so are 4,5,6. But since the options don't have 6, the next lower is 5, but that's also not in the options. So the highest possible option that's less than 6.25 is 3.
