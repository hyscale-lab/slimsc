      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. \n\nThe question is about M men agreeing to purchase a gift for Rs. D. Then, if 3 men drop out, how much more will each have to contribute. Hmm, right. So initially, there are M men sharing the cost D. Then, 3 leave, so there are M-3 left. I need to find out how much more each of the remaining men has to pay compared to before.\n\nWait, so the first step is to figure out the initial contribution per person and then the new contribution after some drop out. The difference between the two will be how much more each has to pay.\n\nLet me break it down. Initially, each man contributes D divided by M. So that's D/M per person. \n\nNow, when 3 men drop out, the number of men becomes M-3. So the new contribution per person is D divided by (M-3), which is D/(M-3).\n\nSo each person's new share is D/(M-3). The question is asking how much more each has to contribute. So I subtract the original amount from this new amount.\n\nSo the additional amount per person is [D/(M-3)] - [D/M]. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, find a common denominator. The denominators are (M-3) and M. So common denominator is M*(M-3).\n\nSo [D/(M-3)] = [D*M]/[M*(M-3)] and [D/M] = [D*(M-3)]/[M*(M-3)].\n\nSubtracting these: [D*M - D*(M-3)] / [M(M-3)].\n\nSimplify the numerator: D*M - D*M + 3D = 3D.\n\nSo the numerator is 3D and denominator is M(M-3).\n\nSo the additional amount each has to pay is 3D / [M(M-3)].\n\nWait, looking at the options, let's see. \n\nOption A is D/(M-3). That's the new contribution, but the question asks how much more, so that's not the answer. \n\nOption B: MD/3. That doesn't seem right. \n\nOption C: M/(D-3). Hmm, that's a different structure. Doesn't fit. \n\nOption D: 3D/(M\u00b2-3M). Wait, M squared minus 3M is M(M-3), right? Because M\u00b2-3M = M(M-3). So 3D/(M(M-3)) is the same as option D's expression. Because D/(M-3) is the new share, but the difference is 3D/(M(M-3)).\n\nSo option D is 3D/(M\u00b2-3M), which is same as 3D/(M(M-3)). \n\nSo the correct answer would be option D.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The initial per person was D/M. After 3 drop out, it's D/(M-3). The difference is D/(M-3) - D/M.\n\nCompute that:\n\nD/(M-3) - D/M = D [1/(M-3) - 1/M] = D [ (M - (M-3)) / [M(M-3)] ) ] = D [ (3) / (M(M-3)) ) ] = 3D/(M(M-3)).\n\nWhich is the same as 3D/(M\u00b2 -3M), since M\u00b2 -3M = M(M-3).\n\nSo yes, option D is correct.\n",

So that's D/M per person.\n\nAfter 3 men drop out, the number of men becomes M-3. So the new contribution per person would be D divided by (M-3). So that's D/(M-3).\n\nNow, the question is asking how much more each has to contribute. So I need to find the difference between the new contribution and the original one.\n\nThe original contribution is D/M. The new one is D/(M-3). The increase is D/(M-3) minus D/M.\n\nLet me compute that difference. Let's write it out:\n\nDifference = D/(M-3) - D/M.\n\nTo subtract these two fractions, I'll find a common denominator, which would be M*(M-3).\n\nSo, D/(M-3) is equal to D*M / [M(M-3)], and D/M is D*(M-3) / [M(M-3)].\n\nSubtracting them: [D*M - D*(M-3)] / [M(M-3)].\n\nSimplify the numerator: D*M - D*M + 3D = 3D.\n\nSo the difference is 3D / [M(M-3)].\n\nWait, but looking at the options, none of them seem to match this exactly.

How much more each has to contribute. So the difference is 3D/(M(M-3)).\n\nSo if the option D is 3D/(M\u00b2-3M), which is the same as 3D/(M(M-3)), then option D is correct.\n\nWait, but I thought the answer is D. But wait, let me think if I made any mistake in the setup.\n\nAnother approach: Let's take M=5 and D=15 as an example.\n\nOriginal contribution: 15/5 =3 each.\n\nAfter 3 drop out, M=2. Each pays 15/2=7.5.\n\nDifference is 7.5-3=4.5.\n\nNow, compute the options.\n\nOption D: 3*15/(5^2 -3*5) =45/(25-15)=45/10=4.5.

Let's see what it says.\n\nThe problem is about M men agreeing to purchase a gift for Rs. D. Then, if 3 men drop out, how much more will each have to contribute. Hmm, so I think I need to find the difference in what each person has to pay before and after the dropouts.\n\nFirst, let me understand the initial situation. There are M men, and together they're buying a gift that costs D rupees. So each man is supposed to contribute an equal amount. So the initial contribution per man would be D divided by M, right? So that's D/M.\n\nNow, the scenario changes when 3 men drop out. That means the number of men becomes M minus 3. So now, the number of contributors is M-3. The total amount they need to pay is still D, right? Because the gift's cost doesn't change. So each remaining man now has to pay D divided by (M-3). So the new contribution per man is D/(M-3).\n\nThe question is asking how much more each will have to contribute.

Let's see what it says.\n\nThe problem is about M men agreeing to purchase a gift for Rs. D. Then, if 3 men drop out, how much more will each have to contribute. Hmm, so I think I need to find the difference in what each person has to pay before and after the dropouts.\n\nFirst, let me understand the initial situation. There are M men, and together they're buying a gift that costs D rupees. So each man is supposed to contribute an equal amount. So the initial contribution per man would be D divided by M, right? So that's D/M.\n\nNow, the scenario changes when 3 men drop out. That means the number of men becomes M minus 3. So now, the number of contributors is M-3.

Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the original contribution each man was supposed to make. If there are M men and the total cost is D, then each man's share initially is D divided by M. So that's D/M per person.\n\nNow, when 3 men drop out, the number of men becomes M minus 3.

So the increase per person is [D/(M-3)] minus [D/M].\n\nLet me compute that difference.

That's the new contribution, but the question is about how much more each has to pay, so this isn't the increase. So A is not the answer.\n\nOption B: MD/3.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here where M men agree to buy a gift for Rs. D. Then, 3 men drop out, and I need to find out how much more each remaining man has to contribute. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the original contribution each man was supposed to make. If there are M men and the total cost is D, then each man's share initially is D divided by M. So that's D/M per person.\n\nNow, when 3 men drop out, the number of men becomes M minus 3. So the new number is M-3. The total cost of the gift doesn't change, right? It's still D. So the new contribution each man has to make is D divided by (M-3). So the new share is D/(M-3).\n\nThe question asks how much more each man has to contribute now. That means I need to find the difference between the new share and the original share. So the increase per person is [D/(M-3)] minus [D/M].\n\nLet me compute that difference. Let's write it out:\n\nIncrease = (D/(M-3)) - (D/M).\n\nTo subtract these fractions, I'll find a common denominator, which would be M*(M-3). So rewriting both terms:\n\n= [D*M - D*(M-3)] / [M*(M-3)].\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\nD*M - D*M + 3D = 3D.\n\nSo the increase becomes 3D divided by [M*(M-3)].
