      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's see, the question is about finding the likelihood that exactly four out of five randomly chosen registered voters in Burghtown voted in the last election. They say there's a 90% chance that any given registered voter voted. \n\nHmm, right, this sounds like a binomial probability problem. I remember that the binomial distribution is used when there are a fixed number of independent trials, each with two possible outcomes, like success or failure. In this case, each voter is a trial, and success would be if they voted (probability 0.9), and failure if they didn't (probability 0.1).\n\nThe formula for the binomial probability is P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k), where n is the number of trials, k is the number of successes. So here, n is 5 and k is 4.\n\nLet me break it down step by step. First, I need to calculate C(5,4), which is the combination of 5 things taken 4 at a time. I think the combination formula is n! / (k!(n-k)! ). So 5! is 5\u00d74\u00d73\u00d72\u00d71=120. Then, 4! is 24, and (5-4)! is 1. So C(5,4) = 120/(24*1) = 5.\n\nNext, I need to calculate p^k. Since p is 0.9 and k is 4, that's 0.9^4. Let me compute that: 0.9 * 0.9 is 0.81, then 0.81 * 0.9 is 0.729, and 0.729 * 0.9 is 0.6561. So 0.9^4 is 0.6561.\n\nThen, (1-p) raised to the (n-k) power. So 1-p is 0.1, and n-k is 5-4=1. So 0.1^1 is 0.1.\n\nNow, multiply all these together: C(5,4) * (0.9)^4 * (0.1)^1. That's 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1. Let's compute that step by step. First, 5 multiplied by 0.6561. 5 * 0.6 is 3, 5*0.0561 is 0.2805, so adding them together gives 3.2805. Then, multiply by 0.1: 3.2805 * 0.1 = 0.32805.\n\nWait, so that's about 0.32805, which is 32.805%. Looking at the options, option B is 32.8%, which seems to match. \n\nI should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's recompute 0.9^4. 0.9 squared is 0.81, then 0.81 * 0.9 is 0.729, and 0.729 *0.9 is 0.6561. Correct. Then 5 * 0.6561 is 3.2805, and multiplied by 0.1 is 0.32805. Yep, that's right.\n\nSo the answer should be option B, 32.8%. Let me just glance at the other options to make sure. Option A is lower, which would be if maybe I had a lower exponent, but I don't think so. Option C is higher, but that would be for maybe two successes or something else. No, I think I did it right.\n",

So here, n=5, k=4, p=0.9.\n\nLet me break it down. First, calculate C(5,4). That's the number of ways to choose 4 successes out of 5 trials. C(5,4) is 5, because there are five different ways: each time leaving out one of the five voters.\n\nNext, p^k is 0.9^4. I'll need to calculate that. And (1-p)^(n-k) is 0.1^(5-4)=0.1^1=0.1.\n\nSo putting it all together: P(4) = 5 * (0.9^4) * (0.1^1).\n\nLet me compute each part. 0.9^4. Let's see, 0.9 squared is 0.81. Then squared again, 0.81 * 0.81 is... wait, 0.81*0.8 is 0.648, plus 0.81*0.01 is 0.0081, so total 0.6561. So 0.9^4 is 0.6561.\n\nThen 0.1 is 0.1.

Now, they're asking me to find the approximate likelihood that exactly four out of five randomly chosen registered voters voted in the last election.\n\nHmm, okay. So each voter is an independent event, I think. Each has a 90% chance of voting, which means a 10% chance of not voting. Since we're dealing with a fixed number of trials (five voters) and looking for a specific number of successes (four voters), this sounds like a binomial probability situation.\n\nRight, the binomial probability formula is P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k). Where:\n- C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial.\n- n is the number of trials.\n- k is the number of successes.\n\nSo in this case, n is 5, k is 4, p is 0.9.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate C(5,4). The combination formula is n!/(k! (n-k)!)). So 5! is 120, 4! is 24, and (5-4)! is 1. So 120/(24*1) = 5. So C(5,4)=5.\n\nNext, p^k is 0.9^4. Let me compute that. 0.9^4 is 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9. Let's see, 0.9 squared is 0.81, so 0.81 squared is 0.6561. So 0.6561.\n\nThen (1-p)^(n-k) is (0.1)^(5-4) = 0.1^1 = 0.1.\n\nNow, multiplying all the parts together: 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1.\n\nLet me calculate that step by step. 0.6561 * 0.1 is 0.06561.

Yep, that's correct.\n\nAnd the combination was 5, correct because there are five ways to choose four successes out of five trials.\n\nSo yes, 5 * 0.6561 *0.1 = 0.32805, which is about 32.8%.\n",

The combination formula is n!/(k! (n-k)!)). So 5! is 120, 4! is 24, and (5-4)! is 1. So 120/(24*1) = 5. So C(5,4)=5.\n\nNext, p^k is 0.9^4. Let me compute that. 0.9^4 is 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9. Let's see, 0.9 squared is 0.81, so 0.81 squared is 0.6561. So 0.6561.\n\nThen (1-p)^(n-k) is (0.1)^(5-4) = 0.1^1 = 0.1.\n\nNow, multiplying all the parts together: 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1.\n\nLet me calculate that step by step. 0.6561 * 0.1 is 0.06561. Then multiply by 5: 5 * 0.06561 = 0.32805.\n\nSo the probability is approximately 0.32805, which is 32.805%. Looking at the options, option B is 32.8%, which matches that.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. So 0.9^4 is definitely 0.6561? Let me check:\n\n0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81. 0.81 * 0.9 = 0.729, and 0.729 *0.9 = 0.6561. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAnd the combination was 5, correct because there are five ways to choose four successes out of five trials.\n\nSo yes, 5 * 0.6561 *0.1 = 0.32805, which is about 32.8%.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we recognize it as a binomial probability scenario. The binomial probability formula is:\n\n\\[\nP(k) = C(n, k) \\cdot p^k \\cdot (1-p)^{n-k}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(n = 5\\) (number of trials),\n- \\(k = 4\\) (number of successes),\n- \\(p = 0.9\\) (probability of success on a single trial).\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the combination \\(C(5, 4)\\)\nThe combination formula is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k! \\cdot (n-k)!}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(n = 5\\) and \\(k = 4\\):\n\n\\[\nC(5, 4) = \\frac{5!}{4! \\cdot (5-4)!} = \\frac{120}{24 \\cdot 1} = 5\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate \\(p^k\\)\n\\[\np^k = 0.9^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating step-by-step:\n\\[\n0.9^2 = 0.81, \\quad 0.81^2 = 0.6561\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\n0.9^4 = 0.6561\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate \\((1-p)^{n-k}\\)\n\\[\n(1-p)^{n-k} = 0.1^{5-4} = 0.1^1 = 0.1\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Combine the results\nSubstitute all values into the binomial formula:\n\n\\[\nP(4) = C(5, 4) \\cdot 0.9^4 \\cdot 0.1 = 5 \\cdot 0.6561 \\cdot 0.1\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\(0.6561 \\cdot 0.1\\):\n\\[\n0.6561 \\cdot 0.1 = 0.06561\n\\]\n\nThen multiply by 5:\n\\[\n5 \\cdot 0.06561 = 0.32805\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Convert to percentage\n\\[\n0.32805 \\approx 32.8\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, the approximate likelihood that exactly four of the five voters voted in the last election is **32.8%**, which corresponds to option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says that there's a 90% chance that a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election. Then, if five registered voters are chosen at random, what's the approximate likelihood that exactly four of them voted in the last election? The options are A to E, with some percentages.\n\nHmm, I remember that when dealing with probabilities of successes in independent trials, the binomial distribution is the way to go. So each voter is a trial, right? Each has two outcomes: voted (success) or didn't vote (failure). The probability of success is 0.9 for each.\n\nSo the problem is asking for exactly four successes out of five trials. That sounds like a binomial probability problem. The formula for that is:\n\nP(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere:\n- n is the number of trials (5)\n- k is the number of successes (4)\n- p is the probability of success (0.9)\n- C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.\n\nSo let's plug in the numbers. First, calculate the combination C(5,4). That's the number of ways to choose 4 successes out of 5 trials. C(5,4) is 5, because there are five different ways to choose which four voters voted.\n\nNext, p^k is 0.9^4. Let me calculate that. 0.9 squared is 0.81, so 0.9^4 is 0.81 * 0.81. Wait, 0.81 * 0.81 is 0.6561. So 0.9^4 is 0.6561.\n\nThen (1-p)^(n-k) is (0.1)^(5-4) which is 0.1^1 = 0.1.\n\nPutting it all together: 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1. Let's compute that.\n\nFirst multiply 0.6561 * 0.1. That gives 0.06561. Then multiply by 5: 5 * 0.06561. Let me see, 0.06561 *5 is 0.32805. So that's approximately 0.32805, or 32.805%.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 32.8%. That seems to match. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, did I do that right? Let me double-check the combination part. C(5,4) is definitely 5, since choosing 4 out of 5 is the same as leaving out one, and there are 5 choices for which one to leave out.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this probability question here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says that there's a 90% chance that a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election. Then, if five registered voters are chosen at random, what's the approximate likelihood that exactly four of them voted in the last election? The options are A to E, with some percentages.\n\nHmm, I remember that when dealing with probabilities of successes in independent trials, the binomial distribution is the way to go. So each voter is a trial, right? Each has two outcomes: voted (success) or didn't vote (failure). The probability of success is 0.9 for each.\n\nSo the problem is asking for exactly four successes out of five trials. That sounds like a binomial probability problem. The formula for that is:\n\nP(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere:\n- n is the number of trials (5)\n- k is the number of successes (4)\n- p is the probability of success (0.9)\n- C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.\n\nSo let's plug in the numbers. First, calculate the combination C(5,4). That's the number of ways to choose 4 successes out of 5 trials. C(5,4) is 5, because there are five different ways to choose which four voters voted.\n\nNext, p^k is 0.9^4. Let me calculate that. 0.9 squared is 0.81, so 0.9^4 is 0.81 * 0.81. Wait, 0.81 * 0.81 is 0.6561. So 0.9^4 is 0.6561.\n\nThen (1-p)^(n-k) is (0.1)^(5-4) which is 0.1^1 = 0.1.\n\nPutting it all together: 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1. Let's compute that.\n\nFirst multiply 0.6561 * 0.1. That gives 0.06561. Then multiply by 5: 5 * 0.06561. Let me see, 0.06561 *5 is 0.32805. So that's approximately 0.32805, or 32.805%.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 32.8%. That seems to match. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, did I do that right? Let me double-check the combination part. C(5,4) is definitely 5, since choosing 4 out of 5 is the same as leaving out one, and there are 5 choices for which one to leave out. So that's correct.\n\nAnd the exponents: 4 for p, 1 for (1-p). Yep.\n\nCalculations again: 5 * 0.6561 = 3.2805, then multiplied by 0.1 gives 0.32805, which is 32.805%.

Because each voter is an independent event with two possible outcomes: voted or didn't vote. The probability of success is 0.9, and we're looking for exactly 4 successes out of 5 trials.\n\nSo the formula for binomial probability is P = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k).

So that's 0.1.\n\nPutting it all together: 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1. Let's multiply these. 5 * 0.6561 is 3.2805, then multiplied by 0.1 gives 0.32805.\n\nSo that's approximately 32.8% likelihood.

Yeah, because 0.9*0.9 is 0.81, then 0.81^2 is 0.6561. Right. Then 0.1 to the first power is 0.1. Multiply all together: 5 * 0.6561=3.2805, times 0.1 is 0.32805, which is 32.805%.
