Then, find the number?\" Hmm, the options are A)84, B)66, C)28, D)19, E)11.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. I think I can solve it by setting up an equation. Let me denote the unknown number as x.\n\nThe problem says one third of 3/4 of x is 21. So, translating that into math, it should be (1/3) multiplied by (3/4 of x) equals 21. Let me write that out:\n\n(1/3) * (3/4 * x) = 21.\n\nHmm, let's compute that. I can rearrange this equation to solve for x. First, I'll simplify the left side. Multiplying 1/3 and 3/4 together. Let me compute 1/3 * 3/4. The 3s should cancel out. So, 1/3 times 3 is 1, and then 1 times 1/4 is 1/4. So, the equation simplifies to (1/4) * x = 21.\n\nWait, so (1/4)x = 21. To find x, I can multiply both sides by 4. So, x equals 21 *4. Let me calculate that. 21 times 4 is 84. So, x is 84. Looking at the options, option A is 84. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait a second, did I do that correctly? Let me double-check. Let's take 3/4 of 84. 84 divided by 4 is 21, so 3/4 is 3 times 21, which is 63. Then, one third of 63 is 21, right? Because 63 divided by 3 is 21. Yep, that checks out. So, the number is indeed 84. So, the correct answer is A.\n",

So I think the way to approach this is to translate the words into a mathematical equation. Let me break it down. The number we're trying to find is, let's call it 'x' for now.\n\nThe problem states that one third of 3/4 of this number is 21. So, let's parse that. One third of something is the same as (1/3) multiplied by that something. And that something is 3/4 of the number. So putting it together, it's (1/3) multiplied by (3/4 of x), and that equals 21.\n\nLet me write that as an equation. So, (1/3) * (3/4 * x) = 21. Now, I can simplify this equation to solve for x.\n\nWait, let me think about the math here. Multiplying 1/3 by 3/4. Hmm, 1/3 times 3/4. The 3 in the numerator and the 3 in the denominator will cancel each other out. So, 1/3 * 3/4 is (1*3)/(3*4) which simplifies to (3)/(12) or 1/4. Because 3 divided by 3 is 1, and 1 times 1 is 1, so yeah, that reduces to 1/4.\n\nSo now the equation becomes (1/4) * x = 21. To solve for x, I need to get rid of the 1/4 that's multiplied by x. The way to do that is to multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 1/4, which is 4/1 or just 4.\n\nSo, multiplying both sides by 4: 4 * (1/4 x) = 4 * 21.

Because if (1/4)x is 21, then x is 21 * 4. Let me do that multiplication. 21 times 4 is 84. So x is 84.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my steps. So, starting again: One third of 3/4 of x is 21. So, (1/3) * (3/4 x) = 21. Multiply the fractions: (1*3)/(3*4) is 3/12, which is 1/4. So 1/4 x =21. Multiply both sides by 4: x=84. Yep, that seems right.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 84. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, did I consider all the steps correctly? Let me visualize it another way. Let's say the number is 84. Then 3/4 of 84 is 63 (because 84 divided by 4 is 21, multiplied by 3 is 63). Then one third of 63 is 21 (since 63 divided by 3 is 21). Yep, that matches the problem statement. So 84 is the correct answer.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let the unknown number be \\( x \\). The problem states that one third of 3/4 of \\( x \\) is 21. This can be translated into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{4} \\times x = 21\n\\]\n\nSimplify the fractions:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} \\times x = 21\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), multiply both sides of the equation by 4:\n\n\\[\nx = 21 \\times 4 = 84\n\\]\n\nTo verify, calculate 3/4 of 84:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} \\times 84 = 63\n\\]\n\nThen, calculate one third of 63:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 63 = 21\n\\]\n\nThis matches the problem statement, confirming that the number is 84.

So the problem is saying that one third of 3/4 of x equals 21.\n\nBreaking it down, first, 3/4 of x would be (3/4) * x. Then, one third of that would be (1/3) multiplied by (3/4)x. So putting it together, (1/3) * (3/4)x = 21.\n\nWait, let me write that down to make it clearer. So the equation is (1/3) * (3/4)x = 21. Hmm, maybe I can simplify this before solving for x.\n\nLooking at the fractions, 1/3 multiplied by 3/4. Let me calculate that. 1 times 3 is 3, and 3 times 4 is 12. So that's 3/12, which simplifies to 1/4. Oh right, because 3 divided by 3 is 1 and 12 divided by 3 is 4. So 3/12 is 1/4.\n\nSo now the equation becomes (1/4)x = 21.

So I'll multiply both sides of the equation by 4.\n\nThat gives me x = 21 * 4. Let me calculate that. 21 times 4 is... 84. So x is 84.\n\nNow, looking at the options, option A is 84.

Multiplying the fractions: 1*3 is 3, and 3*4 is 12, so 3/12 is 1/4. So (1/4)x = 21. Multiply both sides by 4, x=84. Yep, that seems right.\n\nI don't think I made any calculation errors here.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it says. The question is: If one third of 3/4 of a number is 21. Then, find the number? And there are five options provided.\n\nHmm, I remember that when dealing with fractions of a number, I can represent the number as a variable. Let's say the number is 'x'. So the problem is saying that one third of 3/4 of x equals 21.\n\nBreaking it down, first, 3/4 of x would be (3/4) * x. Then, one third of that would be (1/3) multiplied by (3/4)x. So putting it together, (1/3) * (3/4)x = 21.\n\nWait, let me write that down to make it clearer. So the equation is (1/3) * (3/4)x = 21. Hmm, maybe I can simplify this before solving for x.\n\nLooking at the fractions, 1/3 multiplied by 3/4. Let me calculate that. 1 times 3 is 3, and 3 times 4 is 12. So that's 3/12, which simplifies to 1/4. Oh right, because 3 divided by 3 is 1 and 12 divided by 3 is 4. So 3/12 is 1/4.\n\nSo now the equation becomes (1/4)x = 21. To find x, I need to get rid of the 1/4 that's multiplied by x. The opposite of multiplying by 1/4 is multiplying by 4, right? So I'll multiply both sides of the equation by 4.\n\nThat gives me x = 21 * 4. Let me calculate that. 21 times 4 is... 84. So x is 84.\n\nNow, looking at the options, option A is 84. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, starting with (1/3) of (3/4)x is 21. That's the same as (1/3)*(3/4)x. Multiplying the fractions: 1*3 is 3, and 3*4 is 12, so 3/12 is 1/4. So (1/4)x = 21. Multiply both sides by 4, x=84. Yep, that seems right.\n\nI don't think I made any calculation errors here. So the number must be 84, which is option A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let the unknown number be \\( x \\). The problem states that one third of 3/4 of \\( x \\) is 21. This can be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{4} \\times x = 21\n\\]\n\nSimplify the fractions:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} \\times x = 21\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), multiply both sides by 4:\n\n\\[\nx = 21 \\times 4 = 84\n\\]\n\nThus, the number is 84, which corresponds to option A.\n\nAnswer: A",
