      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to solve this problem. So, the question is about calculating the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 in a cab. The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and then 10 cents for each additional quarter mile. Hmm, okay, so I need to figure out how much distance that money can cover.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the costs. The initial charge is $3.50 for the first quarter mile. Then, each additional quarter mile costs $0.10. So, the total amount I can spend is $8.50.\n\nWait, so after paying the initial $3.50, how much money is left? Let's subtract. $8.50 minus $3.50 is $5.00. So, I have $5 left for the additional distance.\n\nEach additional quarter mile is $0.10. So, how many quarter miles can I get with $5.00? I'll divide $5 by $0.10. 5 divided by 0.1 is 50. So, 50 quarter miles.\n\nWait, but the first quarter is already included in the initial charge. So the additional distance is 50 quarter miles. But each quarter mile is 0.25 miles, right? So I need to calculate the total distance.\n\nSo, the total distance is the initial quarter mile plus 50 quarter miles. Wait, no, wait. The initial quarter mile is one, and then each additional is 0.25. So 1 (from the initial) + 50 * 0.25 miles. Let me compute that.\n\nWait, no. Wait, wait. The initial is one quarter mile, which is 0.25 miles. Then, each additional quarter mile is 0.25 miles. So, the additional 50 quarter miles would be 50 * 0.25 = 12.5 miles. Wait, no, 50 * 0.25 is 12.5? Wait, 50 * 0.25 is 12.5? Wait, 0.25 times 40 is 10, 0.25 times 50 is 12.5. Yeah, that's right.\n\nSo the initial is 0.25 miles, plus 12.5 miles. So total is 0.25 + 12.5 = 12.75 miles. So that's 12.75 miles total.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the math. Because sometimes when you do quick calculations, you might make a mistake.\n\nSo, initial cost: $3.50 for 0.25 miles. Remaining money: 8.50 - 3.50 = $5.00. Each additional 0.25 miles is $0.10. So, how many 0.25 miles can you buy with $5?\n\nNumber of additional quarter miles = 5 / 0.1 = 50. So 50 times 0.25 is 12.5 miles. So total distance is 0.25 + 12.5 = 12.75 miles. That's 12.75 miles, which is option B.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there any possibility that the initial charge is for the first quarter mile and each additional is beyond that? Like, does the first quarter include the initial charge and then each additional is after that? So, the first 0.25 is $3.50, then each 0.25 after that is $0.10. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, with $5, you can get 50 quarter miles, which is 12.5. Add the initial 0.25, total is 12.75. So the answer is option B, 12.75 miles.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it: the initial $3.50 covers 0.25 miles. The rest of the money is for 0.10 per 0.25 miles. So, $8.50 total.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: the total cost is 3.50 + 0.10 * x, where x is the number of quarter miles beyond the first. So, 3.50 + 0.10x \u22648.50.\n\nSo, 0.10x \u22645.00 \u2192 x \u226450. So x is 50. So the total distance is 1 (from the initial) + x * 0.25 miles? Wait, no. Wait, initial is 0.25 miles. Each x is another 0.25. So total distance is 0.25 + (x * 0.25) = 0.25*(1 +x). So when x is 50, it's 0.25*(51) = 12.75. So same result.\n\nSo yes, the maximum distance is 12.75 miles. So option B is correct.\n",

So, how many 0.25 miles can you buy with $5?\n\nNumber of additional quarter miles = 5 / 0.1 = 50. So 50 times 0.25 is 12.5 miles. So total distance is 0.25 + 12.5 = 12.75 miles. That's 12.75 miles, which is option B.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there any possibility that the initial charge is for the first quarter mile and each additional is beyond that?

So the answer is option B, 12.75 miles.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it: the initial $3.50 covers 0.25 miles. The rest of the money is for 0.10 per 0.25 miles. So, $8.50 total.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: the total cost is 3.50 + 0.10 * x, where x is the number of quarter miles beyond the first. So, 3.50 + 0.10x \u22648.50.\n\nSo, 0.10x \u22645.00 \u2192 x \u226450. So x is 50. So the total distance is 1 (from the initial) + x * 0.25 miles? Wait, no. Wait, initial is 0.25 miles. Each x is another 0.25. So total distance is 0.25 + (x * 0.25) = 0.25*(1 +x). So when x is 50, it's 0.25*(51) = 12.75. So same result.\n\nSo yes, the maximum distance is 12.75 miles.

The initial charge is $3.50 for the first quarter-mile. Then, each additional quarter-mile after that costs $0.10. So the total cost will be the initial fee plus the cost of all the extra quarter-miles.\n\nThe total money available is $8.50. So I need to subtract the initial charge from this amount to find out how much is left for the additional distance. Let me calculate that.\n\nTotal money: $8.50\nInitial charge: $3.50\nRemaining money: 8.50 - 3.50 = $5.00\n\nSo, I have $5.00 left to spend on the additional quarter-miles.

I'll divide the remaining money by the cost per additional quarter-mile.\n\nNumber of additional quarter-miles = 5.00 / 0.10 = 50.\n\nSo that's 50 additional quarter-miles.

So the total distance is the first 0.25 miles plus 50 times 0.25 miles.\n\nCalculating the total distance:\n\nTotal distance = 0.25 + (50 * 0.25)\n\nLet me compute 50 * 0.25. 50 times 0.25 is 12.5 miles.

Subtract the initial charge:  \n   \\[\n   \\$8.50 - \\$3.50 = \\$5.00\n   \\]  \n   This leaves \\$5.00 for additional distance.\n\n2. Calculate the number of additional quarter miles you can travel with \\$5.00:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\$5.00}{\\$0.10 \\text{ per quarter mile}} = 50 \\text{ quarter miles}\n   \\]\n\n3. Convert the additional quarter miles to miles:  \n   \\[\n   50 \\times 0.25 = 12.5 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n4. Add the initial quarter mile:  \n   \\[\n   0.25 \\text{ miles} + 12.5 \\text{ miles} = 12.75 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the maximum distance you can travel is **12.75 miles**, which corresponds to option B.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the problem is about calculating the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 in a cab. The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and then 10 cents for each additional quarter mile. Hmm, I need to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me note down the given information. The total money available is $8.50. The initial charge is $3.50 for the first quarter-mile. After that, each extra quarter-mile costs $0.10. So I guess I'll need to subtract the initial charge from the total to find out how much money is left for the additional distances.\n\nSo, total money is $8.50. Subtract the first charge: 8.50 - 3.50 equals... let me do that math. 8.50 minus 3.50 is $5.00 left. Right, that's the amount we can spend on the extra quarter miles.\n\nEach extra quarter-mile is $0.10. So, I need to find out how many quarter-miles I can buy with $5.00. Since each is 10 cents, dividing 5 by 0.10 should give the number of quarter-miles. Let me compute that: 5 divided by 0.10 is 50. So, that's 50 quarter-miles.\n\nWait, wait. Wait a second. Let me make sure I got that right. $0.10 per quarter-mile. So with $5.00, how many times can I add that 10 cents? 5 / 0.10 is indeed 50. So that's 50 times a quarter-mile.\n\nNow, each of those 50 is a quarter-mile. So total additional distance is 50 * 0.25 miles. Let me calculate that. 50 * 0.25 is 12.5 miles. Because 0.25 is a quarter, so 50 quarters make 12 and a half miles.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's not forget the initial quarter-mile. The first part was 0.25 miles, and then the 50 quarter-miles are added. So the total distance is 0.25 + (50 * 0.25) miles.\n\nSo, 50 * 0.25 is 12.5, plus 0.25 makes 12.75 miles. Oh wait, that's one of the options. Looking back, option B is 12.75 miles.\n\nWait, but wait again. Let me double-check my steps. Because sometimes when I'm doing math quickly, I might mix up something.\n\nSo total money is $8.50. Minus $3.50 gives $5.00. Each quarter mile after that is $0.10, so 5 / 0.10 is 50. So 50 quarter-miles. 50 * 0.25 is 12.5 miles. Then add the initial 0.25 miles. 12.5 + 0.25 is 12.75. Yes, that seems right.\n\nWait, but the options also have other numbers. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. For example, maybe the first part is included in the 50 quarter-miles? No, because the first quarter is a flat fee. So the additional are beyond that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of total quarters. Wait, no, the first is 3.50, and the rest are 0.10 each for each quarter after.\n\nSo, the total distance is 0.25 + (50 * 0.25) = 0.25 + 12.5 = 12.75 miles. So that's option B.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is 14.75. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps I forgot something. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about how much each additional quarter mile costs. So $0.10 per quarter mile. So how many can you buy with $5.00? 5 / 0.1 is 50, which is 50 quarter-miles. So that's 50 * 0.25 = 12.5 miles. Plus the initial 0.25, making 12.75. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial quarter is included in the count. Wait, no. The initial quarter is a flat fee, so the 50 is in addition. So I think I'm correct.\n\nWait, but another approach: the total cost equation. Let me model it.\n\nTotal cost = initial charge + (number of additional quarter-miles) * 0.10.\n\nLet me denote x as the number of additional quarter-miles.\n\nSo 3.50 + 0.10x \u2264 8.50.\n\nSo 0.10x \u2264 5.00 \u2192 x \u2264 50.\n\nSo x is 50. So total miles is 0.25 + (50 * 0.25) = 0.25 + 12.5 = 12.75 miles. So that's option B.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the maximum distance I can travel with $8.50 in a cab. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of problems, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nAlright, the cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile. Then, after that, it's 10 cents for each additional quarter-mile. Oh wait, so the first part is a fixed cost, and then each extra quarter-mile adds a little more. I need to figure out how many of those quarter-miles I can get with the remaining money after the initial charge.\n\nSo, the total money I have is $8.50. Let's subtract the initial charge first. That would be 8.50 minus 3.50, right? Let me do that calculation. 8.50 minus 3.50 is 5.00. So I have $5 left after the first quarter-mile.\n\nNow, each additional quarter-mile costs 10 cents. Wait, 10 cents is $0.10. I need to see how many times $0.10 goes into $5.00. So, I'll divide 5.00 by 0.10. Let me compute that. 5 divided by 0.1 is 50. Oh, so that's 50 times. So each time is a quarter-mile, so 50 quarter-miles.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The first quarter is included in the initial $3.50, so the additional 50 quarter-miles are added on top of that. So the total number of quarter-miles is 1 (the first) plus 50 (the additional), making it 51 quarter-miles.\n\nBut wait, I need to convert that into miles. Each quarter-mile is 0.25 miles, right? So 51 times 0.25. Let me calculate that. 50 times 0.25 is 12.5, and then adding the 1 quarter-mile (0.25) gives 12.75 miles total.\n\nHmm, looking at the options, option B is 12.75 miles. So that must be the answer. But wait, let me double-check my math to be sure.\n\nWait, initial cost: $3.50. Then, $5.00 left. Each 10 cents is a quarter-mile. So $5.00 is 50 * $0.10, which is 50 quarter-miles. So 50 * 0.25 = 12.5 miles. Plus the initial 0.25 miles. So 12.5 + 0.25 = 12.75. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the maximum distance is 12.75 miles, which is option B. I think that's right. I don't think I missed anything. The initial charge covers the first quarter, then each 10 cents adds another quarter. So yes, 50 times 0.25 is 12.5, plus 0.25 is 12.75.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo calculate the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 in a cab, start by subtracting the initial charge of $3.50 for the first quarter-mile. This leaves $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00 for additional travel. Each additional quarter-mile costs $0.10, so the number of additional quarter-miles you can afford is $5.00 / $0.10 = 50 quarter-miles. \n\nThe total distance is the sum of the initial quarter-mile and the 50 additional quarter-miles:  \n\\[\n1 \\times 0.25 \\, \\text{miles} + 50 \\times 0.25 \\, \\text{miles} = 0.25 + 12.5 = 12.75 \\, \\text{miles}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the maximum distance you can travel is **12.75 miles**, which corresponds to option B.\n\nAnswer: B",

I'm a bit rusty on word problems, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nThe cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile. Then, each additional quarter-mile is 10 cents. Wait, so the initial charge covers the first quarter, and anything beyond that is charged per quarter-mile. Oh right, that makes sense.\n\nSo the total money I have is $8.50. Let me figure out how much of that is left after the initial charge. Subtracting $3.50 from $8.50 gives me $5.00 left. Because 8.50 minus 3.50 is 5.00. That seems right.\n\nNow, each additional quarter-mile costs 10 cents. Wait, 10 cents is $0.10. So with $5.00, how many quarter-miles can I get? I think I'll divide 5 by 0.10 to find out how many quarter-miles. So 5 divided by 0.10 is 50. So that's 50 quarter-miles after the initial one.\n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check that math. 5 divided by 0.1 is indeed 50, because 0.1 times 50 is 5. So yeah, 50 quarter-miles.\n\nSo the initial quarter-mile plus 50 more quarter-miles. Let me add them up. 1 + 50 = 51 quarter-miles total.\n\nWait, no, wait. Oh wait, no. The initial is one quarter-mile, and each additional is a quarter-mile. So the total distance is 1 (initial) + 50 (additional) = 51 quarter-miles.\n\nBut wait, wait again. So each additional quarter after the first is charged 10 cents. So the first is 3.50, then each 0.25 miles costs 0.10. So the number of additional quarter-miles is 50, so total distance is 51 * 0.25 miles.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, no.

Hmm. 50 * 0.25 is 12.5, and 1 * 0.25 is 0.25. So adding those gives 12.75 miles. So the total distance is 12.75 miles.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 12.75. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recalculate the money part. So initial $3.50. Then, each 10 cents is a quarter-mile. So with $5 left, how many 10 cents are in that? $5 is 500 cents. Each quarter-mile is 10 cents, so 500 /10 = 50. So 50 quarter-miles. So 50 * 0.25 =12.5 miles. Plus the first 0.25 is 12.75.
