I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of problems, but I think I can work through it step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says that if Arun gives $30 to Sajal, then Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. Wait, wait, wait\u2014wait, the names are Arjun and Sajal, but the problem says Arun gives money? Oh, maybe that's a typo. I think it's supposed to be Arjun. Because Arjun is one of the friends. So I'll proceed with that assumption.\n\nSo, first scenario: Arjun gives $30 to Sajal. After that, Sajal's money will be twice what Arjun has left. Let me write that down.\n\nLet me assign variables. Let's say Arjun has A dollars and Sajal has S dollars initially.\n\nIn the first case, Arjun gives $30 to Sajal. So Arjun's new amount is A - 30, and Sajal's new amount is S + 30. According to the problem, Sajal now has twice as much as Arjun. So the equation is:\n\nS + 30 = 2 * (A - 30)\n\nThat's equation one.\n\nNow the second scenario: Sajal gives $10 to Arjun. So Sajal's new amount is S - 10, and Arjun's new amount is A + 10. The problem states that Arjun will then have thrice as much as Sajal. So the equation is:\n\nA + 10 = 3 * (S - 10)\n\nThat's equation two.\n\nNow I have two equations:\n\n1) S + 30 = 2(A - 30)\n2) A + 10 = 3(S - 10)\n\nI need to solve these two equations to find A and S.\n\nLet me expand both equations.\n\nEquation 1:\nS + 30 = 2A - 60\nBring all terms to left:\nS + 30 - 2A + 60 = 0 \u2192 S - 2A + 90 = 0 \u2192 Let's rearrange it as 2A = S + 90.\n\nEquation 2:\nA + 10 = 3S - 30\nBring all terms to left:\nA +10 -3S +30 = 0 \u2192 A -3S +40 = 0 \u2192 Rearranged as A = 3S -40.\n\nSo now, from equation 2, I have A expressed in terms of S: A = 3S -40.\n\nLet me substitute this into equation 1.\n\nEquation 1 after substitution:\n2*(3S -40) = S +90\n\nLet me compute that:\n6S -80 = S +90\n\nSubtract S from both sides:\n5S -80 =90\n\nAdd 80 to both sides:\n5S = 170\n\nDivide by 5:\nS = 34.\n\nSo Sajal has $34 initially. Now plug this back into equation 2 to find A.\n\nA = 3S -40 \u2192 A = 3*34 -40 \u2192 102 -40 =62.\n\nSo Arjun has $62, Sajal has $34.\n\nWait, let me check the options. The options are:\n\nA)62, 35 \u2192 S is 35, no.\n\nB)62,34 \u2192 Yes, that's 62 and 34. So option B.\n\nWait, but let me make sure by plugging the values back into the original scenarios.\n\nFirst scenario: Arjun gives $30 to Sajal.\n\nArjun has 62-30=32, Sajal has 34+30=64. 64 is twice 32. That works.\n\nSecond scenario: Sajal gives $10 to Arjun.\n\nArjun has 62+10=72, Sajal has 34-10=24. 72 is thrice 24. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be option B: 62, 34.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, option C is 34,62. That's reversed. So no, option B is correct.\n",

So, let's denote their initial amounts. Let me say Arjun has A dollars and Sajal has S dollars. \n\nThe first scenario: Arjun gives $30 to Sajal. So after that, Arjun's money becomes A - 30, and Sajal's becomes S + 30. According to the problem, at this point, Sajal has twice as much as Arjun. So the equation here would be S + 30 = 2*(A - 30).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Arjun and Sajal and their money. Hmm, I think I need to figure out how much each of them has. Let's see, the problem gives two scenarios, and I need to set up equations based on those.\n\nFirst, let me parse the problem again. The first condition says, if Arun gives $30 to Sajal, then Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. Wait, Arun? Oh, wait, the problem says Arjun and Sajal are friends. So maybe it's a typo and they meant Arjun. Because otherwise, if it's Arun, that's another person, but that's not the case here.\n\nSo, first condition: Arjun gives $30 to Sajal. After that, Sajal's money is twice what Arjun has left. So let's let A be Arjun's initial amount and S be Sajal's initial amount.\n\nAfter giving $30, Arjun will have A - 30. Sajal will have S + 30. And according to the first condition, S + 30 = 2 * (A - 30). That's equation one.\n\nSecond condition: If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as Sajal is left with. So after Sajal gives $10, Sajal has S -10, and Arjun has A +10. The condition says A +10 = 3*(S -10). That's equation two.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1) S + 30 = 2*(A - 30)\n2) A + 10 = 3*(S -10)\n\nLet me write them down more clearly.\n\nEquation 1:\nS + 30 = 2A - 60\nLet me rearrange that:\nS = 2A -60 -30\nS = 2A -90\n\nEquation 2:\nA +10 = 3S -30\nRearranged:\nA = 3S -30 -10\nA = 3S -40\n\nWait, that's equation two. So now I can substitute equation 1 into equation 2.\n\nFrom equation 1: S = 2A -90.\n\nSubstitute S into equation 2: A = 3*(2A -90) -40\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nA = 6A -270 -40\nA = 6A -310\n\nHmm, subtract 6A from both sides:\n\nA -6A = -310\n-5A = -310\nDivide both sides by -5:\nA = (-310)/(-5) = 62\n\nSo Arjun has $62. Now, plug this back into equation 1 to find S.\n\nS = 2A -90 = 2*62 -90 = 124 -90 = 34.\n\nSo Arjun has 62, Sajal has 34. Let me check the options.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 62 and 34. Option C is 34 and 62. So the correct answer is B, right?\n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me plug these values back into the original conditions.\n\nFirst condition: Arjun gives $30 to Sajal.\n\nArjun after: 62 -30 = 32. Sajal after: 34 +30 = 64. Is 64 equal to twice 32? Yes, 2*32 is 64. So first condition holds.\n\nSecond condition: Sajal gives $10 to Arjun.\n\nSajal after: 34 -10 =24. Arjun after: 62 +10=72. Is 72 equal to thrice 24? 3*24 is 72.

Let's let Arjun's money be A dollars and Sajal's be S dollars.\n\nFirst scenario: Arjun gives $30 to Sajal.\n\nAfter giving, Arjun has A - 30. Sajal has S + 30. The problem says that Sajal will have twice as much as Arjun. So, the equation should be:\n\nS + 30 = 2*(A - 30)\n\nThat's equation one.\n\nSecond scenario: Sajal gives $10 to Arjun.\n\nAfter this, Sajal has S - 10. Arjun has A + 10. The problem states that Arjun will have thrice as much as Sajal. So the equation is:\n\nA + 10 = 3*(S - 10)\n\nThat's equation two.\n\nNow I have two equations:\n\n1. S + 30 = 2(A - 30)\n2. A + 10 = 3(S - 10)\n\nI need to solve these two equations to find A and S.\n\nLet me expand both equations.\n\nEquation 1: S +30 = 2A -60. Let's rearrange terms. Subtract 2A from both sides and subtract 30 from both sides:\n\nS = 2A -60 -30\nS = 2A -90\n\nWait, no, let me do it correctly. Let's expand equation 1:\n\nS + 30 = 2A - 60\n\nSo, S = 2A -60 -30? Wait, no. Wait, the original equation is S + 30 = 2*(A -30) which is 2A -60. So moving 30 to the right:\n\nS = 2A -60 -30. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me subtract 30 from both sides.\n\nWait, no. Let's solve for S:\n\nS + 30 = 2A -60\n\nSubtract 30 from both sides:\n\nS = 2A -60 -30 \u2192 S = 2A -90.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nEquation 2: A +10 =3(S -10) \u2192 A +10 = 3S -30.\n\nBring all terms to one side: A = 3S -30 -10 \u2192 A =3S -40.\n\nSo now I have:\n\nFrom equation 1: S = 2A -90\nFrom equation 2: A =3S -40\n\nHmm. Let's substitute equation 2 into equation 1. So, substitute A in terms of S into S's equation.\n\nSo equation 1 becomes: S = 2*(3S -40) -90\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nS = 6S -80 -90 \u2192 S =6S -170\n\nNow, subtract 6S from both sides:\n\nS -6S = -170 \u2192 -5S = -170 \u2192 5S=170 \u2192 S=34.\n\nSo Sajal has $34.\n\nNow, substitute S=34 into equation 2: A=3*34 -40.\n\n34 *3 is 102. 102-40=62. So Arjun has $62.\n\nSo Arjun has $62, Sajal has $34. Let's check the options.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)62,35 \u2192 Sajal is 35, but we got 34. So no.\n\nB)62,34 \u2192 Arjun 62, Sajal 34. That's what I got. So option B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the scenarios to make sure.\n\nFirst scenario: Arjun gives $30 to Sajal.\n\nArjun now has 62-30=32. Sajal has 34+30=64. Is 64 twice 32? Yes, 2*32=64. So that works.\n\nSecond scenario: Sajal gives $10 to Arjun.\n\nArjun has 62+10=72. Sajal has 34-10=24. Is 72 thrice 24? 3*24=72. Yes, that works too.\n\nSo the correct answer is option B)62,34.\n",

So equation 2 is:\n\nA +10 = 3*(S -10)\n\nNow I have two equations:\n\n1) S +30 = 2(A -30)\n2) A +10 = 3(S -10)\n\nI can solve these equations step by step.\n\nLet me expand both equations.\n\nEquation 1: S +30 = 2A -60\nRearranging: 2A - S = 90\n\nEquation 2: A +10 = 3S -30\nRearranging: A -3S = -40\n\nSo now I have:\n\nEquation 1: 2A - S = 90\nEquation 2: A -3S = -40\n\nHmm, I can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let me use elimination.\n\nLet me multiply equation 2 by 2 so that I can eliminate A.\n\nEquation 2 multiplied by 2: 2A -6S = -80\n\nNow, subtract equation 1 from this new equation.\n\nEquation 1: 2A - S = 90\nEquation 2*2: 2A -6S = -80\nSubtracting: (2A -6S) - (2A -S) ) = -80 -90\nSimplify: 2A -6S -2A + S = -170\nWhich becomes: -5S = -170\nSo, S = (-170)/(-5) = 34.\n\nSo Sajal has 34 dollars. Now, plug S=34 into equation 1 or 2 to find A.\n\nLet me use equation 1: 2A -34 =90 \u2192 2A = 124 \u2192 A=62.\n\nSo Arjun has 62 dollars, Sajal has 34.\n\nWait, looking at the options, option B is (62,34) which is Arjun first, Sajal second.
