      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about simple interest and compound interest. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that the difference between simple interest and compound interest on Rs.5000 for 2 years is Rs.72. I need to find the rate of interest. The options are A)10%, B)12%, C)6%, D)8%, E)4%.\n\nWait, I remember that simple interest is calculated as principal times rate times time. So for SI, it's P * R * T. And compound interest, for two years, it's P*(1 + R)^T minus the principal. Oh wait, but sometimes people calculate it as SI plus interest on the interest for the second year.\n\nRight, so the formula for SI is P * R * T. For CI, it's P*( (1 + R)^T - 1 ). So for two years, CI is P*( (1 + R)^2 - 1 ). The difference between CI and SI is given as Rs.72.\n\nSo the equation would be: CI - SI = 72.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nP * ( (1 + R)^2 - 1 ) - (P * R * T) = 72.\n\nWait, substituting the values: P is 5000, T is 2, so:\n\n5000 * ( (1 + R/100)^2 - 1 ) - 5000 * R/100 * 2 = 72.\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it.\n\nLet me factor out 5000 from both terms:\n\n5000 [ ( (1 + R/100)^2 - 1 ) - ( R/100 * 2 ) ] =72.\n\nWait, let's compute the inside of the brackets. Let me expand (1 + R/100)^2: that's 1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2.\n\nSo the first term becomes 1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2 - 1 = 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2.\n\nSo substituting that into the equation:\n\n5000 [ ( 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2 ) - ( 2*(R/100) ) ] =72.\n\nWait, wait a second. Because the second term is R/100 multiplied by 2, so when we subtract that, let me see:\n\nThe inside becomes [ (2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2 ) - (2*(R/100)) ].\n\nSo the 2*(R/100) terms cancel out. What's left is (R/100)^2.\n\nSo the equation simplifies to:\n\n5000 * (R/100)^2 =72.\n\nNow, let's compute that. So (R^2)/(10000) *5000 =72.\n\nWait, 5000 * (R^2 / 10000) equals 72.\n\nThat's the same as (5000 * R^2 ) / 10000 =72.\n\nSimplify the fractions: 5000/10000 is 1/2. So (R^2)/2 =72.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: R^2 = 144.\n\nTake the square root: R=12. Because rate can't be negative.\n\nSo the rate is 12%, which is option B.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Let me compute SI and CI with R=12% for 2 years on 5000.\n\nSI: 5000 * 12% * 2 = 5000 * 0.12 *2 = 5000 * 0.24=1200.\n\nCI: 5000*(1.12)^2. Let's compute 1.12 squared: 1.2544. So 5000 *1.2544=6272. So CI is 6272-5000=1272.\n\nDifference is 1272 - 1200=72. Which matches the given condition. So yes, the rate is 12%, so option B.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the rate of interest. The question says that the difference between simple interest and compound interest on Rs.5000 for 2 years is Rs.72. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that simple interest is calculated as Principal \u00d7 Rate \u00d7 Time, right? So the formula for SI is P \u00d7 R \u00d7 T. And compound interest, for two years, I think it's P \u00d7 (1 + R/100)^T minus the principal. Because CI is calculated on the amount, which includes the interest from the previous periods.\n\nSo let's write down the formulas:\n\nSimple Interest (SI) = (P \u00d7 R \u00d7 T) / 100\nCompound Interest (CI) = P \u00d7 (1 + R/100)^T - P\n\nWait, for two years, the CI would be P*(1 + R/100)^2 - P. Right, because it's compounded once each year, so each year's interest is added to the principal.\n\nThe difference between CI and SI for two years is given as Rs.72. So:\n\nCI - SI = 72\n\nSubstituting the formulas:\n\n[P*(1 + R/100)^2 - P] - [P*R*T / 100] = 72\n\nGiven that P is 5000, T is 2 years. Let's plug those values in.\n\nSo:\n\n5000 * [(1 + R/100)^2 - 1] - 5000*(R*2/100) = 72\n\nLet me factor out 5000:\n\n5000 [ ( (1 + R/100)^2 - 1 ) - (2R/100) ] = 72\n\nWait, maybe it's better to simplify each part separately. Let's compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate CI:\n\nCI = 5000*(1 + R/100)^2 - 5000\n\nWhich is 5000 [ (1 + R/100)^2 - 1 ]\n\nAnd SI is 5000*(R*2)/100 = 5000*(2R)/100 = 100R.\n\nSo the difference CI - SI is 72:\n\n5000 [ (1 + R/100)^2 - 1 ] - 100R = 72\n\nLet me expand (1 + R/100)^2:\n\n(1 + R/100)^2 = 1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2\n\nSo substituting back:\n\n5000 [ (1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2 - 1 ) ] -100 R =72\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n1 and -1 cancel out, so:\n\n5000 [ 2*(R/100) + (R^2)/(100)^2 ) ] -100 R =72\n\nLet me factor R from the terms inside:\n\n5000 [ (2R/100) + (R^2)/(10000) ) ] -100 R =72\n\nHmm, let me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term inside the brackets: 2R/100 = R/50.\n\nSecond term: R\u00b2/(100)^2 = R\u00b2/10000.\n\nSo:\n\n5000 [ R/50 + R\u00b2/10000 ] -100 R =72\n\nLet me compute 5000 multiplied by each term.\n\n5000*(R/50) = 5000R/50 = 100 R.\n\n5000*(R\u00b2/10000) = (5000 R\u00b2)/10000 = R\u00b2 / 20.\n\nSo now, substituting back:\n\n100 R + (R\u00b2 /20 ) - 100 R =72\n\nWait, the 100R and -100R cancel each other out. So:\n\n(R\u00b2)/20 =72\n\nMultiply both sides by 20:\n\nR\u00b2 = 72 *20 = 1440\n\nSo R = sqrt(1440). Let's calculate that.\n\nWait, 1440 is 144 *10. So sqrt(144*10) = 12 * sqrt(10). Hmm, sqrt(10) is about 3.162, so 12*3.162 is around 37.94. That can't be right because the options are 4,6,8,10,12. So I must have made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nWait, wait, let's retrace. Did I make a mistake in expanding the terms?\n\nWait, let me go back to the difference equation.\n\nCI - SI =72\n\nSo CI = 5000*(1 + R/100)^2 -5000\n\nSI = 5000*(R*2)/100 = 100 R\n\nSo difference is:\n\n5000*( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 ) -100 R =72\n\nLet me compute (1 + R/100)^2 -1:\n\n= 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2\n\nSo the first part is 5000*( 2R/100 + R\u00b2/(100)^2 )\n\n=5000*( 2R/100 ) +5000*( R\u00b2/(100)^2 )\n\n=5000*(R/50) +5000*(R\u00b2)/10000\n\n=100 R + (5000 R\u00b2)/10000\n\n=100 R + (R\u00b2)/20\n\nThen subtract 100 R:\n\nSo 100 R + (R\u00b2)/20 - 100 R = (R\u00b2)/20 =72\n\nSo R\u00b2=72*20=1440, R= sqrt(1440) \u2248 37.946%\n\nWait, that's not possible because the options are much lower. So I must have messed up somewhere.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the formula for CI. Let me check.\n\nWait, for two years, CI is P*(1 + R/100)^2 - P. That's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the subtraction. The difference is CI - SI. Let me recheck.\n\nCI = 5000*(1 + R/100)^2 -5000\n\nSI = 5000*R*2/100 = 100 R\n\nSo CI - SI = 5000*( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 ) -100 R\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nWait, but when I expand (1 + R/100)^2 -1, I get 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2.\n\nSo, 5000*(2R/100) = 5000*(R/50) = 100 R.\n\n5000*( (R/100)^2 ) =5000*(R\u00b2/10000) = (5000 R\u00b2)/10000 = R\u00b2 /20.\n\nSo the difference is 100 R + (R\u00b2/20) -100 R = R\u00b2/20 =72.\n\nSo R\u00b2 = 72 *20 =1440. So R = sqrt(1440) \u2248 37.946%.\n\nBut that's way higher than any of the options. The options are 4,6,8,10,12. So I must have made a mistake in my setup.\n\nWait, wait a minute. Maybe I messed up the formula for the difference. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should have considered the difference between CI and SI for two years. Let me recall that for two years, the difference between CI and SI is P*(R/100)^2.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think.\n\nFor two years, the SI is P*R*T/100 = P*R*2/100.\n\nCI is P*(1+R/100)^2 - P = P [ (1 + 2R/100 + (R/100)^2 ) -1 ] = P*(2R/100 + R\u00b2/(100)^2 )\n\nSo CI = P*(2R/100 + R\u00b2/(100)^2 )\n\nThen, CI - SI = P*(2R/100 + R\u00b2/(100)^2 ) - P*(2R/100 )\n\n= P*(R\u00b2/(100)^2 )\n\nSo, the difference is (P*R\u00b2)/(100)^2 = 72\n\nSo P is 5000, so:\n\n5000 * R\u00b2 / (10000) ) =72\n\nSimplify:\n\n(5000 R\u00b2 ) / 10000 = 72\n\nWhich is R\u00b2 * 5000 / 10000 = R\u00b2 * 0.5 =72\n\nSo R\u00b2 = 72 * 2 = 144\n\nR = sqrt(144) =12.\n\nAh! That makes sense. So R is 12%, which is option B.\n\nWait, so why did I get a different result earlier? Oh, because I messed up the difference equation. Initially, I thought the difference was R\u00b2/20=72, but actually, the correct difference formula is (P R\u00b2 )/(100^2) =72.\n\nSo let me re-calculate it correctly.\n\nSo, difference = (5000 * R\u00b2 )/(100^2) =72\n\nSo 5000 R\u00b2 /10000 =72\n\nSimplify 5000/10000 =0.5\n\nSo 0.5 R\u00b2 =72 \u2192 R\u00b2=144 \u2192 R=12%\n\nSo the rate is 12%, which is option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the rate of interest. The question says that the difference between simple interest and compound interest on Rs.5000 for 2 years is Rs.72. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that simple interest is calculated as Principal \u00d7 Rate \u00d7 Time, right? So the formula for SI is P \u00d7 R \u00d7 T. And compound interest, for two years, I think it's P \u00d7 (1 + R/100)^T minus the principal. Because CI is calculated on the amount, which includes the interest from the previous periods.\n\nSo let's write down the formulas:\n\nSimple Interest (SI) = (P \u00d7 R \u00d7 T) / 100\nCompound Interest (CI) = P \u00d7 (1 + R/100)^T - P\n\nWait, for two years, the CI would be P*(1 + R/100)^2 - P. Right, because it's compounded once each year, so each year's interest is added to the principal.\n\nThe difference between CI and SI for two years is given as Rs.72. So:\n\nCI - SI = 72\n\nSubstituting the formulas:\n\n[P*(1 + R/100)^2 - P] - [P*R*T / 100] = 72\n\nGiven that P is 5000, T is 2 years. Let's plug those values in.\n\nSo:\n\n5000 * [(1 + R/100)^2 - 1] - 5000*(R*2/100) = 72\n\nLet me factor out 5000:\n\n5000 [ ( (1 + R/100)^2 - 1 ) - (2R/100) ] = 72\n\nWait, maybe it's better to simplify each part separately. Let's compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate CI:\n\nCI = 5000*(1 + R/100)^2 - 5000\n\nWhich is 5000 [ (1 + R/100)^2 - 1 ]\n\nAnd SI is 5000*(R*2)/100 = 5000*(2R)/100 = 100R.\n\nSo the difference CI - SI is 72:\n\n5000 [ (1 + R/100)^2 - 1 ] - 100R = 72\n\nLet me expand (1 + R/100)^2:\n\n(1 + R/100)^2 = 1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2\n\nSo substituting back:\n\n5000 [ (1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2 - 1 ) ] -100 R =72\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n1 and -1 cancel out, so:\n\n5000 [ 2*(R/100) + (R^2)/(100)^2 ) ] -100 R =72\n\nLet me factor R from the terms inside:\n\n5000 [ (2R/100) + (R^2)/(10000) ) ] -100 R =72\n\nHmm, let me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term inside the brackets: 2R/100 = R/50.\n\nSecond term: R\u00b2/(100)^2 = R\u00b2/10000.\n\nSo:\n\n5000 [ R/50 + R\u00b2/10000 ] -100 R =72\n\nLet me compute 5000 multiplied by each term.\n\n5000*(R/50) = 5000R/50 = 100 R.\n\n5000*(R\u00b2/10000) = (5000 R\u00b2)/10000 = R\u00b2 / 20.\n\nSo now, substituting back:\n\n100 R + (R\u00b2 /20 ) - 100 R =72\n\nWait, the 100R and -100R cancel each other out. So:\n\n(R\u00b2)/20 =72\n\nMultiply both sides by 20:\n\nR\u00b2 = 72 *20 = 1440\n\nSo R = sqrt(1440). Let's calculate that.\n\nWait, 1440 is 144 *10. So sqrt(144*10) = 12 * sqrt(10). Hmm, sqrt(10) is about 3.162, so 12*3.162 is around 37.94. That can't be right because the options are 4,6,8,10,12. So I must have made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nWait, wait, let's retrace. Did I make a mistake in expanding the terms?\n\nWait, let me go back to the difference equation.\n\nCI - SI =72\n\nSo CI = 5000*(1 + R/100)^2 -5000\n\nSI = 5000*(R*2)/100 = 100 R\n\nSo difference is:\n\n5000*( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 ) -100 R =72\n\nLet me compute (1 + R/100)^2 -1:\n\n= 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2\n\nSo the first part is 5000*( 2R/100 + R\u00b2/(100)^2 )\n\n=5000*( 2R/100 ) +5000*( R\u00b2/(100)^2 )\n\n=5000*(R/50) +5000*(R\u00b2)/10000\n\n=100 R + (5000 R\u00b2)/10000\n\n=100 R + (R\u00b2)/20\n\nThen subtract 100 R:\n\nSo 100 R + (R\u00b2)/20 - 100 R = (R\u00b2)/20 =72\n\nSo R\u00b2=72*20=1440, R= sqrt(1440) \u2248 37.946%\n\nWait, that's not possible because the options are much lower. So I must have messed up somewhere.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the formula for CI. Let me check.\n\nWait, for two years, CI is P*(1 + R/100)^2 - P. That's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the subtraction. The difference is CI - SI. Let me recheck.\n\nCI = 5000*(1 + R/100)^2 -5000\n\nSI = 5000*R*2/100 = 100 R\n\nSo CI - SI = 5000*( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 ) -100 R\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nWait, but when I expand (1 + R/100)^2 -1, I get 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2.\n\nSo, 5000*(2R/100) = 5000*(R/50) = 100 R.\n\n5000*( (R/100)^2 ) =5000*(R\u00b2/10000) = (5000 R\u00b2)/10000 = R\u00b2 /20.\n\nSo the difference is 100 R + (R\u00b2/20) -100 R = R\u00b2/20 =72.\n\nSo R\u00b2 = 72 *20 =1440. So R = sqrt(1440) \u2248 37.946%.\n\nBut that's way higher than any of the options. The options are 4,6,8,10,12. So I must have made a mistake in my setup.\n\nWait, wait a minute. Maybe I messed up the formula for the difference. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should have considered the difference between CI and SI for two years. Let me recall that for two years, the difference between CI and SI is P*(R/100)^2.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think.\n\nFor two years, the SI is P*R*T/100 = P*R*2/100.\n\nCI is P*(1+R/100)^2 - P = P [ (1 + 2R/100 + (R/100)^2 ) -1 ] = P*(2R/100 + R\u00b2/(100)^2 )\n\nSo CI = P*(2R/100 + R\u00b2/(100)^2 )\n\nThen, CI - SI = P*(2R/100 + R\u00b2/(100)^2 ) - P*(2R/100 )\n\n= P*(R\u00b2/(100)^2 )\n\nSo, the difference is (P*R\u00b2)/(100)^2 = 72\n\nSo P is 5000, so:\n\n5000 * R\u00b2 / (10000) ) =72\n\nSimplify:\n\n(5000 R\u00b2 ) / 10000 = 72\n\nWhich is R\u00b2 * 5000 / 10000 = R\u00b2 * 0.5 =72\n\nSo R\u00b2 = 72 * 2 = 144\n\nR = sqrt(144) =12.\n\nAh! That makes sense. So R is 12%, which is option B.\n\nWait, so why did I get a different result earlier? Oh, because I messed up the difference equation. Initially, I thought the difference was R\u00b2/20=72, but actually, the correct difference formula is (P R\u00b2 )/(100^2) =72.\n\nSo let me re-calculate it correctly.\n\nSo, difference = (5000 * R\u00b2 )/(100^2) =72\n\nSo 5000 R\u00b2 /10000 =72\n\nSimplify 5000/10000 =0.5\n\nSo 0.5 R\u00b2 =72 \u2192 R\u00b2=144 \u2192 R=12%\n\nSo the rate is 12%, which is option B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the rate of interest \\( R \\) such that the difference between compound interest (CI) and simple interest (SI) on Rs. 5000 for 2 years is Rs. 72.\n\n### Step 1: Formulas for SI and CI\n- **Simple Interest (SI):**\n  \\[\n  SI = \\frac{P \\cdot R \\cdot T}{100}\n  \\]\n  For \\( P = 5000 \\), \\( T = 2 \\), and \\( R \\) as the rate:\n  \\[\n  SI = \\frac{5000 \\cdot R \\cdot 2}{100} = 100R\n  \\]\n\n- **Compound Interest (CI):**\n  \\[\n  CI = P \\cdot \\left(1 + \\frac{R}{100}\\right)^T - P\n  \\]\n  For \\( P = 5000 \\) and \\( T = 2 \\):\n  \\[\n  CI = 5000 \\cdot \\left(1 + \\frac{R}{100}\\right)^2 - 5000\n  \\]\n\n### Step 2: Difference Between CI and SI\nThe difference between CI and SI is given as Rs. 72:\n\\[\nCI - SI = 72\n\\]\nSubstitute the expressions for \\( CI \\) and \\( SI \\):\n\\[\n5000 \\cdot \\left(1 + \\frac{R}{100}\\right)^2 - 5000 - 100R = 72\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Simplify the Equation\nExpand \\( \\left(1 + \\frac{R}{100}\\right)^2 \\):\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\frac{R}{100}\\right)^2 = 1 + 2\\frac{R}{100} + \\left(\\frac{R}{100}\\right)^2\n\\]\nSubstitute back into the equation:\n\\[\n5000 \\cdot \\left(1 + 2\\frac{R}{100} + \\left(\\frac{R}{100}\\right)^2 - 1\\right) - 100R = 72\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\\[\n5000 \\cdot \\left(2\\frac{R}{100} + \\left(\\frac{R}{100}\\right)^2\\right) - 100R = 72\n\\]\n\\[\n5000 \\cdot \\frac{2R}{100} + 5000 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{R}{100}\\right)^2 - 100R = 72\n\\]\n\\[\n100R + \\frac{R^2}{20} - 100R = 72\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{R^2}{20} = 72\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Solve for \\( R \\)\nMultiply both sides by 20:\n\\[\nR^2 = 72 \\cdot 20 = 1440\n\\]\nTake the square root:\n\\[\nR = \\sqrt{1440} \\approx 37.946\\%\n\\]\n\nThis result is inconsistent with the given options (4%, 6%, 8%, 10%, 12%).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about simple interest and compound interest. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The question says that the difference between simple interest (S.I.) and compound interest (C.I.) for Rs.5000 over 2 years is Rs.72. I need to find the rate of interest.\n\nWait, I remember that the formula for simple interest is S.I. = P * R * T, where P is principal, R is rate, and T is time in years. And for compound interest, especially when it's compounded annually, the formula is C.I. = P * (1 + R/100)^T - P. Oh right, because you earn interest on the interest in the second year.\n\nSo the problem states that the difference between C.I. and S.I. is 72 rupees. So, C.I. minus S.I. equals 72.\n\nLet me write down the formulas:\n\nS.I. = (5000 * R * 2) / 100. Wait, because the formula is (P * R * T) / 100. So that's (5000 * R * 2) / 100. Simplify that: 5000 is 50 * 100, so 5000/100 is 50. So 50 * R * 2 = 100 R. So S.I. = 100 R.\n\nFor C.I., the formula is 5000*(1 + R/100)^2 - 5000. So let me expand that. 5000*( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 ). Expanding the square: (1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2) -1 = 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2. So C.I. = 5000 * [2*(R/100) + (R^2)/(10000) ].\n\nWait, let me compute that. 5000 * 2*(R/100) is 5000 * 2R /100 = (5000/100)*2R = 50 *2R = 100 R. Then, 5000 * (R\u00b2)/(10000) is (5000 * R\u00b2)/10000 = (5000/10000)*R\u00b2 = (0.5)*R\u00b2.\n\nSo C.I. = 100 R + 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nNow, the difference between C.I. and S.I. is 72. So:\n\nC.I. - S.I. = (100 R + 0.5 R\u00b2) - 100 R = 0.5 R\u00b2 = 72.\n\nSo 0.5 R\u00b2 =72. Multiply both sides by 2: R\u00b2 = 144. So R is sqrt(144) =12.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that.\n\nSo, 0.5 R\u00b2 =72 \u2192 R\u00b2=144 \u2192 R=12. So the rate is 12% per annum. Looking at the options, option B is 12%.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Because sometimes when you have two years, the difference comes from the second year's interest. Oh, right, because in the first year, both S.I. and C.I. are the same. But in the second year, C.I. gains interest on the first year's interest.\n\nSo another way to think about it: The difference comes from the interest on the first year's interest. The first year's interest for C.I. is same as S.I., which is 5000*R*1/100 = 50 R. In the second year, C.I. adds interest on this 50 R, so it's 50 R * R/100 = 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nSo the difference between C.I. and S.I. for two years is 0.5 R\u00b2. So setting that equal to 72: 0.5 R\u00b2 =72 \u2192 R\u00b2=144 \u2192 R=12.\n\nYes, that confirms it. So the rate is 12%, which is option B.\n",

In the second year, C.I. adds interest on this 50 R, so it's 50 R * R/100 = 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nSo the difference between C.I. and S.I. for two years is 0.5 R\u00b2. So setting that equal to 72: 0.5 R\u00b2 =72 \u2192 R\u00b2=144 \u2192 R=12.\n\nYes, that confirms it. So the rate is 12%, which is option B.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the rate of interest (R) where the difference between compound interest (C.I.) and simple interest (S.I.) for Rs. 5000 over 2 years is Rs. 72. \n\n### Key Formulas:\n1. **Simple Interest (S.I.)**:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{S.I.} = \\frac{P \\cdot R \\cdot T}{100} = \\frac{5000 \\cdot R \\cdot 2}{100} = 100R\n   \\]\n\n2. **Compound Interest (C.I.)**:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{C.I.} = P \\cdot \\left(1 + \\frac{R}{100}\\right)^T - P\n   \\]\n   Expanding for \\(T = 2\\):  \n   \\[\n   \\text{C.I.} = 5000 \\cdot \\left(1 + \\frac{R}{100}\\right)^2 - 5000\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{C.I.} = 5000 \\cdot \\left(2 \\cdot \\frac{R}{100} + \\left(\\frac{R}{100}\\right)^2\\right) = 100R + 0.5R^2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Difference Between C.I. and S.I.**:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{C.I.} - \\text{S.I.} = (100R + 0.5R^2) - 100R = 0.5R^2\n   \\]\n   Given that this difference is Rs. 72:  \n   \\[\n   0.5R^2 = 72\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\(R\\):  \n   \\[\n   R^2 = 144 \\implies R = \\sqrt{144} = 12\\%\n   \\]\n\nThus, the rate of interest is **12%**, which corresponds to option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the rate of interest. The question says that the difference between simple interest and compound interest on Rs.5000 for 2 years is Rs.72. Hmm, I remember that simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount, while compound interest is calculated on the principal plus any accumulated interest. \n\nLet me jot down what I know. The principal (P) is 5000 rupees, the time (t) is 2 years. The difference between CI and SI is 72 rupees. I need to find the rate (r).\n\nWait, right. The formula for simple interest is SI = (P * r * t)/100. And compound interest for 2 years would be CI = P*(1 + r/100)^2 - P. The difference between CI and SI is given as 72, so CI - SI =72.\n\nLet me write the equations out. \n\nSI = (5000 * r * 2)/100 = (10000r)/100 = 100r.\n\nCI is calculated as P*(1 + r/100)^2 minus P. So for 5000, it's 5000*( (1 + r/100)^2 -1 ). Let me expand that: 5000*(1 + 2*(r/100) + (r/100)^2 -1 ) = 5000*(2r/100 + r\u00b2/(100)^2 ) = 5000*( (200r + r\u00b2)/10000 ) = (5000 * (200r + r\u00b2)) / 10000. Simplifying that: (5000 / 10000) * (200r + r\u00b2) = 0.5*(200r + r\u00b2) = 100r + 0.5r\u00b2.\n\nSo CI is 100r + 0.5r\u00b2, and SI is 100r. The difference is CI - SI = (100r + 0.5r\u00b2) -100r = 0.5r\u00b2.\n\nWait, according to the problem, the difference is 72. So 0.5r\u00b2 =72. Solving for r: r\u00b2 = 72 *2 =144. So r is sqrt(144)=12. So the rate is 12%? Let me check the options. Option B is 12%. \n\nBut wait, did I do that correctly? Let me re-calculate. Let me think: \n\nThe formula for the difference between CI and SI for 2 years is (P*(r)^2)/(100)^2. Wait, is that right? Because I remember that for two years, the difference is (P*(r^2))/ (100)^2. Let me see: \n\nCI = P*(1 + r/100)^2 - P = P*( (1 + 2r/100 + r\u00b2/10000) -1 ) = P*(2r/100 + r\u00b2/10000) = P*(200r + r\u00b2)/10000.\n\nSI is P*r*t/100 = 5000*r*2/100 = 100r.\n\nSo the difference is CI - SI = (5000*(200r + r\u00b2))/10000 - 100r. Let's compute this:\n\n5000*(200r + r\u00b2) = 5000*200r = 1,000,000 r; 5000*r\u00b2 is 5000 r\u00b2. Divided by 10000: (1,000,000r +5000r\u00b2)/10000 = 100r + 0.5r\u00b2.\n\nSubtracting SI (100r), the difference is 0.5r\u00b2. So 0.5r\u00b2=72 => r\u00b2=144 => r=12%. \n\nSo the rate is 12%, which is option B.\n",

The options are A to E, with rates like 10%, 12%, etc.\n\nWait, I remember that simple interest is calculated each year on the principal amount, while compound interest is calculated on the principal plus any accumulated interest from previous periods.

So, the equation should be CI - SI = 72. Let me plug in the values. The principal P is 5000, T is 2 years.\n\nLet me compute SI first. SI = (5000 * R * 2)/100. That simplifies to (5000 * 2R)/100 = 100R.\n\nNow, for CI: CI = 5000*(1 + R/100)^2 - 5000. Let's expand that. 5000*(1 + 2R/100 + (R^2)/(10000)) - 5000.

So R is 12%, which is option B.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the rate of interest \\( R \\) where the difference between compound interest (CI) and simple interest (SI) for Rs. 5000 over 2 years is Rs. 72. \n\n### Key Equations:\n1. **Simple Interest (SI):**  \n   \\[\n   SI = \\frac{P \\cdot R \\cdot T}{100} = \\frac{5000 \\cdot R \\cdot 2}{100} = 100R\n   \\]\n\n2. **Compound Interest (CI):**  \n   \\[\n   CI = P \\cdot \\left(1 + \\frac{R}{100}\\right)^T - P = 5000 \\cdot \\left(1 + \\frac{R}{100}\\right)^2 - 5000\n   \\]\n   Expanding the compound interest formula:\n   \\[\n   CI = 5000 \\cdot \\left(1 + \\frac{2R}{100} + \\frac{R^2}{10000}\\right) - 5000 = 100R + 0.5R^2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Difference Between CI and SI:**  \n   \\[\n   CI - SI = (100R + 0.5R^2) - 100R = 0.5R^2\n   \\]\n   Given that \\( CI - SI = 72 \\):\n   \\[\n   0.5R^2 = 72 \\implies R^2 = 144 \\implies R = \\sqrt{144} = 12\\%\n   \\]\n\n### Verification:\n- **SI:**  \n  \\[\n  SI = 100R = 100 \\cdot 12 = 1200\n  \\]\n- **CI:**  \n  \\[\n  CI = 100R + 0.5R^2 = 100 \\cdot 12 + 0.5 \\cdot 12^2 = 1200 + 72 = 1272\n  \\]\n- **Difference:**  \n  \\[\n  CI - SI = 1272 - 1200 = 72\n  \\]\n\nThe calculations confirm that \\( R = 12\\% \\) satisfies the condition.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about simple interest and compound interest. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question says that the difference between simple interest (S.I.) and compound interest (C.I.) on Rs.5000 for 2 years is Rs.72. I need to find the rate of interest. The options are given, so maybe I can plug them in or use formulas to find the rate.\n\nFirst, I remember the formulas for both interests. Simple interest is straightforward: S.I. = P * R * T, where P is principal, R is rate, and T is time. For compound interest, since it's compounded annually (I think that's the default unless stated otherwise), the formula is A = P*(1 + R/100)^T. But wait, compound interest is calculated on the principal and the accumulated interest. So the interest for each year is calculated on the new amount.\n\nWait, but when the problem refers to the difference between S.I. and C.I., I think it's the difference in the interests themselves, not the total amounts. So the difference would be C.I. minus S.I., which equals Rs.72.\n\nSo let me write down the equations. Let's denote R as the rate in percentage.\n\nS.I. for 2 years: S.I. = 5000 * R * 2 / 100. Simplifying, that's (5000 * 2R)/100 = 100 R.\n\nC.I. for 2 years: The amount after 2 years is 5000*(1 + R/100)^2. But the compound interest is the amount minus principal, so C.I. = 5000*( (1 + R/100)^2 - 1 ). Let me compute that.\n\nThe difference is C.I. - S.I. = 72. So:\n\n5000 * [ (1 + R/100)^2 - 1 ] - (5000 * R * 2 / 100) = 72.\n\nHmm, let's simplify this equation.\n\nFirst, expand (1 + R/100)^2. That's 1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2.\n\nSo the C.I. becomes 5000 * [ 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2 ].\n\nPutting that back into the equation:\n\n5000 * [ 2R/100 + (R^2)/(100^2) ] - (5000 * 2R / 100 ) =72.\n\nLet me compute each term. The first term is 5000*(2R/100) which is 5000*2R /100 = 100R. The second term is 5000*(R^2)/(10000) which is (5000 R^2)/10000 = (50 R^2)/100 = 0.05 R^2. So the C.I. is 100R + 0.05 R^2.\n\nThe S.I. is 100 R. So the difference is (100R +0.05 R^2) - 100R = 0.05 R^2.\n\nWait, but that's equal to 72. So 0.05 R^2 =72.\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. So solving for R^2: R^2 = 72 / 0.05 = 1440. Then R would be sqrt(1440). Wait, sqrt(1440) is sqrt(144*10) =12*sqrt(10) which is about 37.95%. But that's way higher than any of the options given. Hmm, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the expansion. Let me double-check. The C.I. formula is 5000*( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 ). Expanding (1 + R/100)^2 gives 1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2. Subtract 1, so it's 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2. Multiply by 5000: 5000*(2R/100) + 5000*(R^2)/(100^2). That's 100 R + (5000 R^2)/(10000). 5000/10000 is 0.5, so it's 100 R + 0.5 R^2.\n\nAh, wait! I think I made a mistake earlier. 5000 * (R^2)/(100^2) is 5000 R^2 / 10000 = (5000/10000) R^2 = 0.5 R^2. So the C.I. is 100R + 0.5 R^2.\n\nThe S.I. is 100 R. So the difference is (100R +0.5 R^2) -100 R = 0.5 R^2. So 0.5 R^2 =72.\n\nSo R^2 =72 * 2 =144. So R is sqrt(144)=12. So R=12%.\n\nLooking at the options, B is 12%. So the answer should be B)12%.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let's plug R=12% into the original equations.\n\nS.I. for 2 years: 5000 *12 *2 /100 = 5000*24/100= 5000*0.24=1200.\n\nC.I. for 2 years: amount is 5000*(1.12)^2. 1.12 squared is 1.2544. So 5000 *1.2544 =6272. The interest is 6272-5000=1272.\n\nDifference is 1272 -1200=72. Which matches the given difference. So yes, 12% is correct. So the answer is B.\n",
