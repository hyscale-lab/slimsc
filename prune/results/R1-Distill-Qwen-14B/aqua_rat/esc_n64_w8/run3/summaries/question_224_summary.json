      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about discounts on tyres, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me see. The manufacturer is giving a 20% discount, and the retailer is also offering an additional 20%. Hmm, wait, how do discounts stack up? I remember that when you have multiple discounts, you can't just add them up because the second discount is applied after the first. So it's not 40% off, that's for sure.\n\nWait, so let's think in terms of percentages. Let's say the original price of the tyre is $100. That makes the math easier. So the manufacturer gives 20% off first. 20% of 100 is 20, so the price becomes $80 after the first discount.\n\nNow the retailer gives another 20% off. But wait, is this 20% off the original price or the discounted price? I think it's the discounted price. Because usually, when they offer an additional discount, it's on top of the existing discount. So 20% of $80 is 16. So subtracting that, the new price is $80 - $16 = $64.\n\nSo the total discount is the original $100 minus the final price of $64. That's a $36 discount. Wait, so 36% of the original price? Because 36 is 36% of 100. Oh, wait, no. Wait, the total discount is 36 dollars off of 100, so the discount is 36%. So the total discount available is 36%, right?\n\nLooking at the options, E is 36%. So the answer should be E. But wait, let me double-check. Another way to calculate it: when you apply two successive discounts of 20% each, the overall discount is not 40%. Let's compute it using multiplication. The first discount is 20%, so the remaining is 80% (which is 0.8). The second discount is another 20%, so the remaining is again 80%. So overall, it's 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64, which is 64% of the original price. So the total discount is 100% - 64% = 36%. Yeah, that's correct. So the answer is E.\n",

Hmm, the manufacturer is giving a 20% discount, and then a retailer is offering another 20% off. I need to find the total discount available at that retailer.\n\nWait, wait, wait. So the manufacturer's discount is 20%, right? So if the original price is, say, $100, then the manufacturer's discount would bring it down to $80.

I think it's the latter because the retailer is giving an extra discount on top of the manufacturer's. So the 20% is on the $80, not the $100.\n\nCalculating that: 20% of $80 is 16. So the retailer's discount brings the price down by $16. So the new price is $80 minus $16, which is $64.\n\nSo, the total discount from the original price is $36. Because $100 minus $64 is $36.

Then, some retailers are adding their own discounts. The question is, if a retailer gives an additional 20% discount, what's the total discount available? Hmm.\n\nWait, so the manufacturer's discount is first applied, right? Then the retailer's discount is applied on top of that. But I think the way discounts stack matters here. Let me think about how percentages work when applied successively.\n\nLet's say the original price of the tyre is $100. That makes the math easier. So, the manufacturer's discount is 20%, which would be $20 off. So the price after the manufacturer's discount is $80.\n\nNow, the retailer is giving an additional 20% discount. But wait, is this 20% on the original price or on the already discounted price? I think it's on the discounted price because the manufacturer's discount has already been applied. So 20% of $80 is $16. So the retailer's discount would bring the price down by $16, making the total price $64.\n\nWait, but what's the total discount from the original price? The original was $100, and now it's $64. So the total discount is $36. To find the percentage, I calculate (36/100)*100% which is 36%. So the total discount is 36%, right?\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it: the discounts are applied one after the other. So the first discount is 20%, which brings the price to 80% of the original. The second discount is another 20%, so that's 80% of the already discounted price. So mathematically, the combined effect is 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64, which is 64% of the original price. So the discount is 100% - 64% = 36%. \n\nLooking at the options, E is 36%. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but sometimes people get confused when combining discounts. Like, adding 20% and 20% would make 40%, but that's not how it works because the second discount is on a reduced price. So 20% off followed by another 20% off isn't 40% off.

This reduces the price to 80% of $80, which is $64.\n\n3. **Total Discount**: The final price after both discounts is $64. The total discount from the original price is $100 - $64 = $36. To express this as a percentage of the original price:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Discount} = \\frac{36}{100} \\times 100\\% = 36\\%.\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total discount available at the retailer is **36%**.\n\nAnswer: E",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about discounts on tyres. Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nThe manufacturer is giving a 20% discount on tubeless tyres. Then, some retailers are adding their own discounts. The question is, if a retailer gives an additional 20% discount, what's the total discount available? Hmm.\n\nWait, so the manufacturer's discount is first applied, right? Then the retailer's discount is applied on top of that. But I think the way discounts stack matters here. Let me think about how percentages work when applied successively.\n\nLet's say the original price of the tyre is $100. That makes the math easier. So, the manufacturer's discount is 20%, which would be $20 off. So the price after the manufacturer's discount is $80.\n\nNow, the retailer is giving an additional 20% discount. But wait, is this 20% on the original price or on the already discounted price? I think it's on the discounted price because the manufacturer's discount has already been applied. So 20% of $80 is $16. So the retailer's discount would bring the price down by $16, making the total price $64.\n\nWait, but what's the total discount from the original price? The original was $100, and now it's $64. So the total discount is $36. To find the percentage, I calculate (36/100)*100% which is 36%. So the total discount is 36%, right?\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it: the discounts are applied one after the other. So the first discount is 20%, which brings the price to 80% of the original. The second discount is another 20%, so that's 80% of the already discounted price. So mathematically, the combined effect is 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64, which is 64% of the original price. So the discount is 100% - 64% = 36%. \n\nLooking at the options, E is 36%. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but sometimes people get confused when combining discounts. Like, adding 20% and 20% would make 40%, but that's not how it works because the second discount is on a reduced price. So 20% off followed by another 20% off isn't 40% off. It's less than that, which is why the correct answer is 36%.\n\n\nTo determine the total discount when a manufacturer offers a 20% discount followed by an additional 20% discount from a retailer, we calculate the combined effect of the two discounts.\n\n1. **Manufacturer's Discount**: The manufacturer applies a 20% discount, reducing the price to 80% of the original price. For example, if the original price is $100, the price after the manufacturer's discount is $80.\n\n2. **Retailer's Discount**: The retailer then applies an additional 20% discount, which is calculated on the already discounted price of $80. This reduces the price to 80% of $80, which is $64.\n\n3. **Total Discount**: The final price after both discounts is $64. The total discount from the original price is $100 - $64 = $36. To express this as a percentage of the original price:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Discount} = \\frac{36}{100} \\times 100\\% = 36\\%.\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total discount available at the retailer is **36%**.\n\nAnswer: E",
