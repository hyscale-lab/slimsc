      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where a man borrows Rs.360 and pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50 each. I need to find the interest rate. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nFirst, let me understand the situation. He's taking a loan of 360 rupees and repaying it over 12 months with each installment being 31.50. So the total amount he's paying back is 12 multiplied by 31.50. Let me calculate that. 12 times 30 is 360, and 12 times 1.5 is 18, so adding those together gives 378. So the total repayment is 378 rupees.\n\nWait, that means the total interest paid is 378 minus 360, which is 18 rupees. So he's paying 18 rupees as interest over the 12 months. Now, I need to find the interest rate. But wait, what kind of interest rate is this? Is it simple interest or compound interest? I'm not sure. The problem doesn't specify, but I think in such cases, especially when dealing with installments, it's often simple interest unless stated otherwise.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you have equal monthly installments, the calculation can get a bit more involved because each installment reduces the principal. Hmm, maybe it's better to model this as an annuity or use the concept of present value of an ordinary annuity. Because each installment is a payment at the end of each period, so that's an ordinary annuity.\n\nThe formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is:\n\nPV = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]\n\nWhere:\nPV = present value (the amount borrowed, 360)\nPMT = monthly payment (31.50)\nr = monthly interest rate (which we need to find)\nn = number of payments (12)\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n360 = 31.50 * [(1 - (1 + r)^-12 ) / r ]\n\nHmm, solving for r here might be tricky because it's in the exponent and also in the denominator. I don't think there's a straightforward algebraic solution, so maybe I can try plugging in the options to see which one fits.\n\nWait, but the options are given as annual interest rates. Oh right, because the answer options are in percentage per annum. So I need to find the monthly rate first, then multiply by 12 to get the annual rate.\n\nLet me list the options:\n\nA)1.5% \u2192 annual rate is 1.5%, so monthly rate is 0.00125 (1.5% /12)\nB)4.5% \u2192 0.00375\nC)10% \u2192 0.008333...\nD)5% \u2192 0.004166...\nE)12% \u2192 0.01\n\nWait, but let me think. For each option, calculate the PV using the PMT and the given r, and see which one equals approximately 360.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can estimate. Let me try option D first because the total interest is 18 over 360, so the simple interest rate would be (18/360)*100 = 5% per annum. But wait, that's under simple interest, but since he's paying installments, it's not simple interest. So the actual rate must be higher than 5%, because in simple interest, you pay the same interest each month, but here, as he pays each installment, the principal reduces. So the interest each month would be less than the simple interest calculation.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. In simple interest, the interest is calculated on the original principal for the entire period. So for 12 months, the interest would be 360 * (r/100) * 1. So if the total interest is 18, then r would be (18/(360*1)) *100 = 5%. So the simple interest rate is 5%. But since he's paying installments, which reduces the principal over time, the effective interest rate should be lower than 5% because the principal is being paid down each month, so the interest is calculated on a smaller amount each month. Wait, that would make the total interest paid less than 18, but in this case, it's exactly 18. So that's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about whether the interest is calculated based on the reducing balance. Hmm, perhaps this is a case of simple interest but with monthly installments. Let me model that.\n\nIn a reducing balance, each installment reduces the principal. So the first payment of 31.50 would include interest for the first month, and the rest would be principal.\n\nWait, let me try to calculate the interest for each month.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the interest using the reducing balance method. Let me outline the steps.\n\nPrincipal at start: 360.\n\nEach month, he pays 31.50. Let's assume that each payment consists of interest for the month plus a part of the principal.\n\nSo, let me denote the monthly interest rate as r.\n\nAt the first month, interest is 360 * r. So the principal paid is 31.50 - 360*r. The remaining principal is 360 - (31.50 - 360*r).\n\nBut wait, that seems complicated. Maybe it's better to model it as an equation using the present value of the payments.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for installment loans, where the present value is the sum of each payment discounted by the monthly rate.\n\nSo, the present value PV is 360. Each PMT is 31.50, and n=12. So,\n\n360 = 31.50 * [1/(1+r) + 1/(1+r)^2 + ... + 1/(1+r)^12 ]\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\n360 = 31.50 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-12 ) / r ]\n\nSo, we can rearrange this equation to solve for r.\n\nLet me compute the factor [ (1 - (1 + r)^-12 ) / r ].\n\nWe can call this factor F. So,\n\nF = (1 - (1 + r)^-12 ) / r\n\nThen, 360 = 31.50 * F \u2192 F = 360 / 31.50 = 11.428571...\n\nSo F \u2248 11.42857.\n\nNow, I need to find r such that (1 - (1 + r)^-12 ) / r \u2248 11.42857.\n\nHmm, but I think trial and error might be easier here.\n\nLet me try option D first, which is 5% annual rate. So the monthly rate is 5% /12 \u2248 0.0041667.\n\nCompute F for r=0.0041667:\n\nCompute (1 + r)^12: (1.0041667)^12.\n\nLet me compute that. The formula for (1 + r)^n, where r=0.0041667 and n=12.\n\nUsing the approximation, but maybe I can compute it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula (1 + r)^n \u2248 1 + n*r + n(n-1)*r\u00b2/2. But for small r, perhaps this is manageable.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to compute (1.0041667)^12.\n\nI can compute it as:\n\n1.0041667^12 \u2248 e^(12 * ln(1.0041667)).\n\nCompute ln(1.0041667):\n\nln(1.0041667) \u2248 0.004158.\n\nMultiply by 12: 0.049896.\n\ne^0.049896 \u2248 1.05128.\n\nSo (1.0041667)^12 \u2248 1.05128.\n\nSo, (1 + r)^-12 = 1 / 1.05128 \u2248 0.95123.\n\nThen, 1 - 0.95123 = 0.04877.\n\nDivide by r: 0.04877 / 0.0041667 \u2248 11.7.\n\nWait, our F is supposed to be 11.42857. So 11.7 is a bit higher than 11.42857. So the actual r is a bit higher than 0.0041667 (5% annual rate). Because when r increases, the denominator (r) increases, making F decrease. Wait, wait, because when r increases, (1 + r)^-12 decreases, so 1 - (1 + r)^-12 increases. So the numerator increases, but denominator also increases. So the effect on F is not straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try a higher rate. Let me try option E, which is 12% annual. So monthly rate is 0.01.\n\nCompute F for r=0.01.\n\n(1.01)^12 \u2248 1.126825.\n\n(1 + 0.01)^-12 \u2248 1 / 1.126825 \u2248 0.887449.\n\n1 - 0.887449 = 0.112551.\n\nDivide by 0.01: 11.2551.\n\nWhich is less than 11.42857. So F is 11.2551, which is lower than required 11.42857.\n\nSo at 12% annual, F is 11.2551. But we need F=11.42857. So the correct r is between 0.0041667 (5%) and 0.01 (12%).\n\nWait, that can't be right because 12% is higher than 5% and F was 11.2551 which is lower than required. So perhaps the correct rate is lower than 12% but higher than 5%.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try option B, which is 4.5% annual. So monthly rate is 0.00375.\n\nCompute (1 + 0.00375)^12.\n\nLet me compute this: 1.00375^12.\n\nI can compute this using the formula:\n\n(1 + r)^n \u2248 1 + nr + n(n-1)r\u00b2/2.\n\nr = 0.00375, n=12.\n\nSo,\n\n1 + 12*(0.00375) + (12*11)*(0.00375)^2 / 2.\n\n12 * 0.00375 = 0.045.\n\n(12*11)=132; 0.00375^2=0.0000140625.\n\n132 * 0.0000140625 = 0.001857.\n\nDivide by 2: 0.0009285.\n\nSo total approximation: 1 + 0.045 + 0.0009285 \u2248 1.0459285.\n\nSo (1.00375)^12 \u2248 1.04593.\n\nSo (1 + r)^-12 \u2248 1/1.04593 \u2248 0.9560.\n\n1 - 0.9560 = 0.044.\n\nDivide by r (0.00375): 0.044 / 0.00375 = 11.666667.\n\nHmm, F is 11.6667 when r=0.00375 (4.5% annual). The required F is 11.42857, which is lower than 11.6667. So to get F=11.42857, the r must be higher than 0.00375.\n\nWait, but wait: when r increases, the denominator in F increases, and the numerator (1 - (1 + r)^-12) also increases, but perhaps not as much as the denominator. So maybe F decreases as r increases.\n\nWait, let me think again: when r increases, (1 + r)^-12 decreases, so 1 - (1 + r)^-12 increases. So the numerator increases, but denominator (r) also increases. So the effect on F is not clear-cut. Let me test with a higher r.\n\nLet me try r=0.004 (which is 0.4% monthly, 4.8% annual).\n\nCompute (1.004)^12.\n\nAgain, using the approximation:\n\n1 + 12*0.004 + (12*11)*(0.004)^2 /2.\n\n12*0.004 = 0.048.\n\n(12*11)=132; (0.004)^2=0.000016.\n\n132 * 0.000016=0.002112. Divided by 2: 0.001056.\n\nTotal \u2248 1 + 0.048 + 0.001056 = 1.049056.\n\n(1.004)^12 \u2248 1.049056.\n\nSo (1.004)^-12 \u2248 1/1.049056 \u2248 0.9531.\n\n1 - 0.9531 = 0.0469.\n\nDivide by r=0.004: 0.0469/0.004 = 11.725.\n\nSo F=11.725, which is higher than required 11.42857. So we need a higher r to reduce F.\n\nWait, because F is higher than needed, perhaps I need to increase r. So let's try a higher r, say r=0.0045 (which is 5.4% annual).\n\nCompute (1.0045)^12.\n\nUsing the same approximation:\n\n12 * 0.0045 = 0.054.\n\n(12*11) =132; (0.0045)^2=0.00002025.\n\n132 * 0.00002025 = 0.002673. Divided by 2: 0.0013365.\n\nSo total approx: 1 + 0.054 + 0.0013365 \u2248 1.0553365.\n\nSo (1.0045)^12 \u2248 1.0553365.\n\n(1.0045)^-12 \u2248 1/1.0553365 \u2248 0.9477.\n\n1 - 0.9477 = 0.0523.\n\nDivide by r=0.0045: 0.0523 / 0.0045 \u2248 11.622.\n\nStill higher than 11.42857. So I need a higher r.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try r=0.005 (6% annual).\n\n(1.005)^12.\n\nApproximate:\n\n12 * 0.005 = 0.06.\n\n(12*11)=132; (0.005)^2=0.000025.\n\n132 * 0.000025 = 0.0033.\n\nDivide by 2: 0.00165.\n\nSo total approx: 1 + 0.06 + 0.00165 = 1.06165.\n\n(1.005)^12 \u2248 1.06165.\n\nSo (1.005)^-12 \u2248 1/1.06165 \u2248 0.9419.\n\n1 - 0.9419 = 0.0581.\n\nDivide by r=0.005: 0.0581 / 0.005 = 11.62.\n\nHmm, same as before, but perhaps this isn't the right approach. Maybe I should use a better approximation method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can set up the equation and use trial and error.\n\nWait, let me consider that for each option, the calculated PV may be close to 360. Let's try each option's monthly rate and see which one makes the present value close to 360.\n\nOption A: 1.5% annual \u2192 r=0.00125.\n\nCompute F for r=0.00125.\n\n(1.00125)^12 \u2248 1 + 12*(0.00125) + (12*11)*(0.00125)^2 /2.\n\n12*0.00125=0.015.\n\n(12*11)=132; (0.00125)^2=0.0000015625.\n\n132 * 0.0000015625=0.00020625.\n\nDivide by 2: 0.000103125.\n\nTotal approx: 1 + 0.015 + 0.000103125 \u2248 1.015103.\n\nSo (1.00125)^12 \u2248 1.015103.\n\n(1.00125)^-12 \u2248 1/1.015103 \u2248 0.985.\n\n1 - 0.985 = 0.015.\n\nDivide by r=0.00125: 0.015 / 0.00125 = 12.\n\nSo F=12. So PV = 31.50 *12=378. But the PV is 360, so this is higher. So this can't be the right r.\n\nWait, because when F is 12, the PV would be 31.50 *12=378, which is higher than 360. So the required F is 11.42857, which is less than 12. So r must be higher than 0.00125.\n\nOption B: 4.5% annual \u2192 r=0.00375.\n\nEarlier calculation gave F\u224811.6667, which would give PV=31.50 * 11.6667\u2248367.5. But the PV is 360, so this is still higher than 360.\n\nHmm, but 367.5 is higher than 360, meaning the required F is lower. So we need a higher r to reduce F.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the Newton-Raphson method to find r more accurately. Let me set up the equation F(r) = (1 - (1 + r)^-12 ) / r = 11.42857.\n\nLet me define F(r) = [1 - (1 + r)^-12 ] / r - 11.42857 = 0.\n\nWe can use the Newton-Raphson method to find the root of this function.\n\nBut perhaps for the sake of time, I can approximate. Let me try a few more r values.\n\nLet's try r=0.0045 (4.5% monthly would be 54% annually, which is not the case. Wait, no, 0.0045 is 0.45% monthly, which is 5.4% annual. Earlier, I think I made a mistake in the calculation, perhaps I should try a better approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should instead compute the present value for each option and see which one is closest to 360.\n\nLet me compute for each option:\n\nOption D: 5% annual \u2192 r=0.0041667.\n\nCompute F = [1 - (1.0041667)^-12 ] / 0.0041667.\n\nEarlier, I estimated (1.0041667)^12 \u2248 1.05128 \u2192 (1 + r)^-12 \u2248 0.95123.\n\nSo F \u2248 (1 - 0.95123) / 0.0041667 \u2192 0.04877 / 0.0041667 \u2248 11.7.\n\nSo PV = 31.50 * 11.7 \u2248 368.55.\n\nBut the actual PV is 360. So 368.55 is higher than 360. So to get a PV of 360, the F needs to be lower than 11.7. Which would require a higher r.\n\nLet me try option E: 12% annual \u2192 r=0.01.\n\nF = [1 - (1.01)^-12 ] / 0.01.\n\n(1.01)^12 \u2248 1.126825 \u2192 (1.01)^-12 \u2248 0.887449.\n\n1 - 0.887449 = 0.112551.\n\nDivide by 0.01 \u2192 F=11.2551.\n\nSo PV = 31.50 *11.2551 \u2248 355.05.\n\nBut 355.05 is lower than 360. So the correct r is between 5% and 12% annual.\n\nBecause at 5%, PV is 368.55, which is higher than 360; at 12%, PV is 355.05, lower than 360.\n\nWait, but wait, no, because when r increases, F decreases, which makes PV decrease. So to reach PV=360, which is between 355 and 368, the r must be between 12% and 5%? No, wait: because when r increases, PV decreases. So the correct r is between 5% and 12%, but we need PV=360, which is between the PVs of 5% and 12%.\n\nWait, no, when r=5%, PV=368.55, which is higher than 360. When r=12%, PV=355.05, which is lower than 360. So the correct r is between 5% and 12%.\n\nWait, but 360 is between 355.05 and 368.55, so the correct r is between 5% and 12% annual.\n\nWait, but the options given include 5% (option D), 10% (option C), 12% (option E).\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer is 10% (option C). Let me check.\n\nOption C: 10% annual \u2192 r=0.008333 per month.\n\nCompute F for r=0.008333.\n\n(1.008333)^12 \u2248 ?\n\nLet me compute this accurately. Using the formula:\n\nln(1.008333) \u2248 0.008293.\n\n12 * ln(1.008333) \u2248 0.09952.\n\ne^0.09952 \u2248 1.10469.\n\nSo (1.008333)^12 \u2248 1.10469.\n\nThus, (1.008333)^-12 \u2248 1/1.10469 \u2248 0.9053.\n\n1 - 0.9053 = 0.0947.\n\nDivide by r=0.008333: 0.0947 / 0.008333 \u2248 11.31.\n\nSo F=11.31.\n\nPV=31.50 *11.31 \u2248 356.0.\n\nHmm, 356 is still lower than 360. So we need a slightly lower r than 10% to get PV=360.\n\nWait, perhaps 9.5% annual? Let me try that.\n\nr=0.095/12=0.0079167.\n\nCompute (1.0079167)^12.\n\nln(1.0079167)=approx 0.00788.\n\n12*0.00788=0.09456.\n\ne^0.09456\u22481.100.\n\n(1.0079167)^12\u22481.100.\n\nSo (1.0079167)^-12\u22481/1.100\u22480.9091.\n\n1 - 0.9091=0.0909.\n\nDivide by r=0.0079167: 0.0909/0.0079167\u224811.48.\n\nSo F\u224811.48.\n\nThen PV=31.50 *11.48 \u2248 361.14.\n\nThat's very close to 360. So perhaps the correct rate is around 9.5% annual, but none of the options are 9.5%. So perhaps the closest option is 10% (option C), which gives PV\u2248356, which is a bit lower than 360.\n\nWait, but in the options, option D is 5% which gives PV=368.55, which is higher than 360. So perhaps the correct answer is not in the options, but I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. Another approach is to calculate the total interest as 18 and the simple interest rate as 5% per annum. But since the installments reduce the principal, the effective interest rate would be higher than 5%. So the correct rate is higher than 5%. But looking at the options, options D is 5%, E is 12%, C is10%, B is4.5%, and A is1.5%.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using simple interest, which would give 5% (option D), but that doesn't account for the reducing principal. So perhaps the intended answer is 5%, but according to the annuity calculation, the correct rate is higher than 5%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a simple interest problem where the interest is calculated on the initial principal for each month, and each payment includes a fixed interest and principal.\n\nWait, let's model it that way.\n\nTotal amount repaid is 12 *31.50=378.\n\nTotal interest is 378-360=18.\n\nSimple interest rate per annum is (18/360)*100=5%. So the answer would be D)5%.\n\nBut wait, this is under simple interest, but the installments would imply that the principal is being paid down each month, so the interest each month is calculated on a reducing balance. So the total interest would be less than 18 in that case. But in this problem, the total interest is 18, which suggests that the simple interest method is being used.\n\nSo perhaps the question assumes simple interest, leading to an answer of 5% (option D).\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because earlier calculations using the annuity formula suggested that the rate is higher than 5%.\n\nBut given that the options include 5% and the problem might be expecting the simple interest approach, perhaps the intended answer is D)5%.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here where a man borrows Rs.360 and pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50 each. I need to find the interest rate. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nFirst, let me understand the situation. He's taking a loan of 360 rupees and repaying it over 12 months with each installment being 31.50. So the total amount he's paying back is 12 multiplied by 31.50. Let me calculate that. 12 times 30 is 360, and 12 times 1.5 is 18, so adding those together gives 378. So the total repayment is 378 rupees.\n\nWait, that means the total interest paid is 378 minus 360, which is 18 rupees. So he's paying 18 rupees as interest over the 12 months. Now, I need to find the interest rate. But wait, what kind of interest rate is this? Is it simple interest or compound interest? I'm not sure. The problem doesn't specify, but I think in such cases, especially when dealing with installments, it's often simple interest unless stated otherwise.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you have equal monthly installments, the calculation can get a bit more involved because each installment reduces the principal. Hmm, maybe it's better to model this as an annuity or use the concept of present value of an ordinary annuity. Because each installment is a payment at the end of each period, so that's an ordinary annuity.\n\nThe formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is:\n\nPV = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]\n\nWhere:\nPV = present value (the amount borrowed, 360)\nPMT = monthly payment (31.50)\nr = monthly interest rate (which we need to find)\nn = number of payments (12)\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n360 = 31.50 * [(1 - (1 + r)^-12 ) / r ]\n\nHmm, solving for r here might be tricky because it's in the exponent and also in the denominator. I don't think there's a straightforward algebraic solution, so maybe I can try plugging in the options to see which one fits.\n\nWait, but the options are given as annual interest rates. Oh right, because the answer options are in percentage per annum. So I need to find the monthly rate first, then multiply by 12 to get the annual rate.\n\nLet me list the options:\n\nA)1.5% \u2192 annual rate is 1.5%, so monthly rate is 0.00125 (1.5% /12)\nB)4.5% \u2192 0.00375\nC)10% \u2192 0.008333...\nD)5% \u2192 0.004166...\nE)12% \u2192 0.01\n\nWait, but let me think. For each option, calculate the PV using the PMT and the given r, and see which one equals approximately 360.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can estimate. Let me try option D first because the total interest is 18 over 360, so the simple interest rate would be (18/360)*100 = 5% per annum. But wait, that's under simple interest, but since he's paying installments, it's not simple interest. So the actual rate must be higher than 5%, because in simple interest, you pay the same interest each month, but here, as he pays each installment, the principal reduces. So the interest each month would be less than the simple interest calculation.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. In simple interest, the interest is calculated on the original principal for the entire period. So for 12 months, the interest would be 360 * (r/100) * 1. So if the total interest is 18, then r would be (18/(360*1)) *100 = 5%. So the simple interest rate is 5%. But since he's paying installments, which reduces the principal over time, the effective interest rate should be lower than 5% because the principal is being paid down each month, so the interest is calculated on a smaller amount each month. Wait, that would make the total interest paid less than 18, but in this case, it's exactly 18. So that's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about whether the interest is calculated based on the reducing balance. Hmm, perhaps this is a case of simple interest but with monthly installments. Let me model that.\n\nIn a reducing balance, each installment reduces the principal. So the first payment of 31.50 would include interest for the first month, and the rest would be principal.\n\nWait, let me try to calculate the interest for each month.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the interest using the reducing balance method. Let me outline the steps.\n\nPrincipal at start: 360.\n\nEach month, he pays 31.50. Let's assume that each payment consists of interest for the month plus a part of the principal.\n\nSo, let me denote the monthly interest rate as r.\n\nAt the first month, interest is 360 * r. So the principal paid is 31.50 - 360*r. The remaining principal is 360 - (31.50 - 360*r).\n\nBut wait, that seems complicated. Maybe it's better to model it as an equation using the present value of the payments.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for installment loans, where the present value is the sum of each payment discounted by the monthly rate.\n\nSo, the present value PV is 360. Each PMT is 31.50, and n=12. So,\n\n360 = 31.50 * [1/(1+r) + 1/(1+r)^2 + ... + 1/(1+r)^12 ]\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\n360 = 31.50 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-12 ) / r ]\n\nSo, we can rearrange this equation to solve for r.\n\nLet me compute the factor [ (1 - (1 + r)^-12 ) / r ].\n\nWe can call this factor F. So,\n\nF = (1 - (1 + r)^-12 ) / r\n\nThen, 360 = 31.50 * F \u2192 F = 360 / 31.50 = 11.428571...\n\nSo F \u2248 11.42857.\n\nNow, I need to find r such that (1 - (1 + r)^-12 ) / r \u2248 11.42857.\n\nHmm, but I think trial and error might be easier here.\n\nLet me try option D first, which is 5% annual rate. So the monthly rate is 5% /12 \u2248 0.0041667.\n\nCompute F for r=0.0041667:\n\nCompute (1 + r)^12: (1.0041667)^12.\n\nLet me compute that. The formula for (1 + r)^n, where r=0.0041667 and n=12.\n\nUsing the approximation, but maybe I can compute it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula (1 + r)^n \u2248 1 + n*r + n(n-1)*r\u00b2/2. But for small r, perhaps this is manageable.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to compute (1.0041667)^12.\n\nI can compute it as:\n\n1.0041667^12 \u2248 e^(12 * ln(1.0041667)).\n\nCompute ln(1.0041667):\n\nln(1.0041667) \u2248 0.004158.\n\nMultiply by 12: 0.049896.\n\ne^0.049896 \u2248 1.05128.\n\nSo (1.0041667)^12 \u2248 1.05128.\n\nSo, (1 + r)^-12 = 1 / 1.05128 \u2248 0.95123.\n\nThen, 1 - 0.95123 = 0.04877.\n\nDivide by r: 0.04877 / 0.0041667 \u2248 11.7.\n\nWait, our F is supposed to be 11.42857. So 11.7 is a bit higher than 11.42857. So the actual r is a bit higher than 0.0041667 (5% annual rate). Because when r increases, the denominator (r) increases, making F decrease. Wait, wait, because when r increases, (1 + r)^-12 decreases, so 1 - (1 + r)^-12 increases. So the numerator increases, but denominator also increases. So the effect on F is not straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try a higher rate. Let me try option E, which is 12% annual. So monthly rate is 0.01.\n\nCompute F for r=0.01.\n\n(1.01)^12 \u2248 1.126825.\n\n(1 + 0.01)^-12 \u2248 1 / 1.126825 \u2248 0.887449.\n\n1 - 0.887449 = 0.112551.\n\nDivide by 0.01: 11.2551.\n\nWhich is less than 11.42857. So F is 11.2551, which is lower than required 11.42857.\n\nSo at 12% annual, F is 11.2551. But we need F=11.42857. So the correct r is between 0.0041667 (5%) and 0.01 (12%).\n\nWait, that can't be right because 12% is higher than 5% and F was 11.2551 which is lower than required. So perhaps the correct rate is lower than 12% but higher than 5%.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try option B, which is 4.5% annual. So monthly rate is 0.00375.\n\nCompute (1 + 0.00375)^12.\n\nLet me compute this: 1.00375^12.\n\nI can compute this using the formula:\n\n(1 + r)^n \u2248 1 + nr + n(n-1)r\u00b2/2.\n\nr = 0.00375, n=12.\n\nSo,\n\n1 + 12*(0.00375) + (12*11)*(0.00375)^2 / 2.\n\n12 * 0.00375 = 0.045.\n\n(12*11)=132; 0.00375^2=0.0000140625.\n\n132 * 0.0000140625 = 0.001857.\n\nDivide by 2: 0.0009285.\n\nSo total approximation: 1 + 0.045 + 0.0009285 \u2248 1.0459285.\n\nSo (1.00375)^12 \u2248 1.04593.\n\nSo (1 + r)^-12 \u2248 1/1.04593 \u2248 0.9560.\n\n1 - 0.9560 = 0.044.\n\nDivide by r (0.00375): 0.044 / 0.00375 = 11.666667.\n\nHmm, F is 11.6667 when r=0.00375 (4.5% annual). The required F is 11.42857, which is lower than 11.6667. So to get F=11.42857, the r must be higher than 0.00375.\n\nWait, but wait: when r increases, the denominator in F increases, and the numerator (1 - (1 + r)^-12) also increases, but perhaps not as much as the denominator. So maybe F decreases as r increases.\n\nWait, let me think again: when r increases, (1 + r)^-12 decreases, so 1 - (1 + r)^-12 increases. So the numerator increases, but denominator (r) also increases. So the effect on F is not clear-cut. Let me test with a higher r.\n\nLet me try r=0.004 (which is 0.4% monthly, 4.8% annual).\n\nCompute (1.004)^12.\n\nAgain, using the approximation:\n\n1 + 12*0.004 + (12*11)*(0.004)^2 /2.\n\n12*0.004 = 0.048.\n\n(12*11)=132; (0.004)^2=0.000016.\n\n132 * 0.000016=0.002112. Divided by 2: 0.001056.\n\nTotal \u2248 1 + 0.048 + 0.001056 = 1.049056.\n\n(1.004)^12 \u2248 1.049056.\n\nSo (1.004)^-12 \u2248 1/1.049056 \u2248 0.9531.\n\n1 - 0.9531 = 0.0469.\n\nDivide by r=0.004: 0.0469/0.004 = 11.725.\n\nSo F=11.725, which is higher than required 11.42857. So we need a higher r to reduce F.\n\nWait, because F is higher than needed, perhaps I need to increase r. So let's try a higher r, say r=0.0045 (which is 5.4% annual).\n\nCompute (1.0045)^12.\n\nUsing the same approximation:\n\n12 * 0.0045 = 0.054.\n\n(12*11) =132; (0.0045)^2=0.00002025.\n\n132 * 0.00002025 = 0.002673. Divided by 2: 0.0013365.\n\nSo total approx: 1 + 0.054 + 0.0013365 \u2248 1.0553365.\n\nSo (1.0045)^12 \u2248 1.0553365.\n\n(1.0045)^-12 \u2248 1/1.0553365 \u2248 0.9477.\n\n1 - 0.9477 = 0.0523.\n\nDivide by r=0.0045: 0.0523 / 0.0045 \u2248 11.622.\n\nStill higher than 11.42857. So I need a higher r.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try r=0.005 (6% annual).\n\n(1.005)^12.\n\nApproximate:\n\n12 * 0.005 = 0.06.\n\n(12*11)=132; (0.005)^2=0.000025.\n\n132 * 0.000025 = 0.0033.\n\nDivide by 2: 0.00165.\n\nSo total approx: 1 + 0.06 + 0.00165 = 1.06165.\n\n(1.005)^12 \u2248 1.06165.\n\nSo (1.005)^-12 \u2248 1/1.06165 \u2248 0.9419.\n\n1 - 0.9419 = 0.0581.\n\nDivide by r=0.005: 0.0581 / 0.005 = 11.62.\n\nHmm, same as before, but perhaps this isn't the right approach. Maybe I should use a better approximation method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can set up the equation and use trial and error.\n\nWait, let me consider that for each option, the calculated PV may be close to 360. Let's try each option's monthly rate and see which one makes the present value close to 360.\n\nOption A: 1.5% annual \u2192 r=0.00125.\n\nCompute F for r=0.00125.\n\n(1.00125)^12 \u2248 1 + 12*(0.00125) + (12*11)*(0.00125)^2 /2.\n\n12*0.00125=0.015.\n\n(12*11)=132; (0.00125)^2=0.0000015625.\n\n132 * 0.0000015625=0.00020625.\n\nDivide by 2: 0.000103125.\n\nTotal approx: 1 + 0.015 + 0.000103125 \u2248 1.015103.\n\nSo (1.00125)^12 \u2248 1.015103.\n\n(1.00125)^-12 \u2248 1/1.015103 \u2248 0.985.\n\n1 - 0.985 = 0.015.\n\nDivide by r=0.00125: 0.015 / 0.00125 = 12.\n\nSo F=12. So PV = 31.50 *12=378. But the PV is 360, so this is higher. So this can't be the right r.\n\nWait, because when F is 12, the PV would be 31.50 *12=378, which is higher than 360. So the required F is 11.42857, which is less than 12. So r must be higher than 0.00125.\n\nOption B: 4.5% annual \u2192 r=0.00375.\n\nEarlier calculation gave F\u224811.6667, which would give PV=31.50 * 11.6667\u2248367.5. But the PV is 360, so this is still higher than 360.\n\nHmm, but 367.5 is higher than 360, meaning the required F is lower. So we need a higher r to reduce F.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the Newton-Raphson method to find r more accurately. Let me set up the equation F(r) = (1 - (1 + r)^-12 ) / r = 11.42857.\n\nLet me define F(r) = [1 - (1 + r)^-12 ] / r - 11.42857 = 0.\n\nWe can use the Newton-Raphson method to find the root of this function.\n\nBut perhaps for the sake of time, I can approximate. Let me try a few more r values.\n\nLet's try r=0.0045 (4.5% monthly would be 54% annually, which is not the case. Wait, no, 0.0045 is 0.45% monthly, which is 5.4% annual. Earlier, I think I made a mistake in the calculation, perhaps I should try a better approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should instead compute the present value for each option and see which one is closest to 360.\n\nLet me compute for each option:\n\nOption D: 5% annual \u2192 r=0.0041667.\n\nCompute F = [1 - (1.0041667)^-12 ] / 0.0041667.\n\nEarlier, I estimated (1.0041667)^12 \u2248 1.05128 \u2192 (1 + r)^-12 \u2248 0.95123.\n\nSo F \u2248 (1 - 0.95123) / 0.0041667 \u2192 0.04877 / 0.0041667 \u2248 11.7.\n\nSo PV = 31.50 * 11.7 \u2248 368.55.\n\nBut the actual PV is 360. So 368.55 is higher than 360. So to get a PV of 360, the F needs to be lower than 11.7. Which would require a higher r.\n\nLet me try option E: 12% annual \u2192 r=0.01.\n\nF = [1 - (1.01)^-12 ] / 0.01.\n\n(1.01)^12 \u2248 1.126825 \u2192 (1.01)^-12 \u2248 0.887449.\n\n1 - 0.887449 = 0.112551.\n\nDivide by 0.01 \u2192 F=11.2551.\n\nSo PV = 31.50 *11.2551 \u2248 355.05.\n\nBut 355.05 is lower than 360. So the correct r is between 5% and 12% annual.\n\nBecause at 5%, PV is 368.55, which is higher than 360; at 12%, PV is 355.05, lower than 360.\n\nWait, but wait, no, because when r increases, F decreases, which makes PV decrease. So to reach PV=360, which is between 355 and 368, the r must be between 12% and 5%? No, wait: because when r increases, PV decreases. So the correct r is between 5% and 12%, but we need PV=360, which is between the PVs of 5% and 12%.\n\nWait, no, when r=5%, PV=368.55, which is higher than 360. When r=12%, PV=355.05, which is lower than 360. So the correct r is between 5% and 12%.\n\nWait, but 360 is between 355.05 and 368.55, so the correct r is between 5% and 12% annual.\n\nWait, but the options given include 5% (option D), 10% (option C), 12% (option E).\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer is 10% (option C). Let me check.\n\nOption C: 10% annual \u2192 r=0.008333 per month.\n\nCompute F for r=0.008333.\n\n(1.008333)^12 \u2248 ?\n\nLet me compute this accurately. Using the formula:\n\nln(1.008333) \u2248 0.008293.\n\n12 * ln(1.008333) \u2248 0.09952.\n\ne^0.09952 \u2248 1.10469.\n\nSo (1.008333)^12 \u2248 1.10469.\n\nThus, (1.008333)^-12 \u2248 1/1.10469 \u2248 0.9053.\n\n1 - 0.9053 = 0.0947.\n\nDivide by r=0.008333: 0.0947 / 0.008333 \u2248 11.31.\n\nSo F=11.31.\n\nPV=31.50 *11.31 \u2248 356.0.\n\nHmm, 356 is still lower than 360. So we need a slightly lower r than 10% to get PV=360.\n\nWait, perhaps 9.5% annual? Let me try that.\n\nr=0.095/12=0.0079167.\n\nCompute (1.0079167)^12.\n\nln(1.0079167)=approx 0.00788.\n\n12*0.00788=0.09456.\n\ne^0.09456\u22481.100.\n\n(1.0079167)^12\u22481.100.\n\nSo (1.0079167)^-12\u22481/1.100\u22480.9091.\n\n1 - 0.9091=0.0909.\n\nDivide by r=0.0079167: 0.0909/0.0079167\u224811.48.\n\nSo F\u224811.48.\n\nThen PV=31.50 *11.48 \u2248 361.14.\n\nThat's very close to 360. So perhaps the correct rate is around 9.5% annual, but none of the options are 9.5%. So perhaps the closest option is 10% (option C), which gives PV\u2248356, which is a bit lower than 360.\n\nWait, but in the options, option D is 5% which gives PV=368.55, which is higher than 360. So perhaps the correct answer is not in the options, but I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. Another approach is to calculate the total interest as 18 and the simple interest rate as 5% per annum. But since the installments reduce the principal, the effective interest rate would be higher than 5%. So the correct rate is higher than 5%. But looking at the options, options D is 5%, E is 12%, C is10%, B is4.5%, and A is1.5%.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using simple interest, which would give 5% (option D), but that doesn't account for the reducing principal. So perhaps the intended answer is 5%, but according to the annuity calculation, the correct rate is higher than 5%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a simple interest problem where the interest is calculated on the initial principal for each month, and each payment includes a fixed interest and principal.\n\nWait, let's model it that way.\n\nTotal amount repaid is 12 *31.50=378.\n\nTotal interest is 378-360=18.\n\nSimple interest rate per annum is (18/360)*100=5%. So the answer would be D)5%.\n\nBut wait, this is under simple interest, but the installments would imply that the principal is being paid down each month, so the interest each month is calculated on a reducing balance. So the total interest would be less than 18 in that case. But in this problem, the total interest is 18, which suggests that the simple interest method is being used.\n\nSo perhaps the question assumes simple interest, leading to an answer of 5% (option D).\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because earlier calculations using the annuity formula suggested that the rate is higher than 5%.\n\nBut given that the options include 5% and the problem might be expecting the simple interest approach, perhaps the intended answer is D)5%.\n\n\nTo determine the interest rate, we analyze the loan details: the man borrows Rs. 360 and repays it in 12 monthly installments of Rs. 31.50 each. The total repayment amount is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total repayment} = 12 \\times 31.50 = 378 \\, \\text{Rs}.\n\\]\n\nThe total interest paid is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total interest} = 378 - 360 = 18 \\, \\text{Rs}.\n\\]\n\n### Simple Interest Approach\nUnder the simple interest formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Interest} = \\text{Principal} \\times \\text{Rate} \\times \\text{Time}.\n\\]\n\nHere, the principal is Rs. 360, the total interest is Rs. 18, and the time is 1 year (12 months). Rearranging for the annual interest rate (\\(r\\)):\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{\\text{Interest}}{\\text{Principal} \\times \\text{Time}} \\times 100 = \\frac{18}{360 \\times 1} \\times 100 = 5\\%.\n\\]\n\nThis suggests a simple interest rate of 5% per annum.\n\n### Annuity Approach\nFor installment loans, the present value of the payments can be modeled using the present value of an ordinary annuity formula:\n\n\\[\nPV = PMT \\times \\frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r},\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(PV = 360 \\, \\text{Rs}\\) (the loan amount),\n- \\(PMT = 31.50 \\, \\text{Rs}\\) (monthly installment),\n- \\(n = 12\\) (number of payments),\n- \\(r\\) is the monthly interest rate.\n\nRearranging for \\(r\\) requires solving:\n\n\\[\n360 = 31.50 \\times \\frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-12}}{r}.\n\\]\n\nDividing through by 31.50:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-12}}{r} = \\frac{360}{31.50} \\approx 11.4286.\n\\]\n\nThis equation is solved iteratively or numerically. Testing the given options:\n\n1. **Option A (1.5% annual, \\(r = 0.00125\\)):**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1 - (1 + 0.00125)^{-12}}{0.00125} \\approx 12.0.\n   \\]\n   This overestimates the present value, as \\(31.50 \\times 12.0 = 378\\), which is higher than 360.\n\n2. **Option B (4.5% annual, \\(r = 0.00375\\)):**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1 - (1 + 0.00375)^{-12}}{0.00375} \\approx 11.6667.\n   \\]\n   This also overestimates the present value, as \\(31.50 \\times 11.6667 \\approx 367.5\\), which is higher than 360.\n\n3. **Option C (10% annual, \\(r = 0.008333\\)):**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1 - (1 + 0.008333)^{-12}}{0.008333} \\approx 11.31.\n   \\]\n   This underestimates the present value, as \\(31.50 \\times 11.31 \\approx 356.0\\), which is lower than 360.\n\n4. **Option D (5% annual, \\(r = 0.0041667\\)):**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1 - (1 + 0.0041667)^{-12}}{0.0041667} \\approx 11.7.\n   \\]\n   This overestimates the present value, as \\(31.50 \\times 11.7 \\approx 368.55\\), which is higher than 360.\n\n5. **Option E (12% annual, \\(r = 0.01\\)):**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1 - (1 + 0.01)^{-12}}{0.01} \\approx 11.2551.\n   \\]\n   This underestimates the present value, as \\(31.50 \\times 11.2551 \\approx 355.05\\), which is lower than 360.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe annuity approach suggests the correct interest rate lies between 5% and 12%. However, the problem likely assumes simple interest, as the total interest aligns with a 5% annual rate under this method. Thus, the most reasonable answer is:\n\n**Answer: D**",

I need to find out the interest rate. The options are A)1.5%, B)4.5%, C)10%, D)5%, E)12%.\n\nHmm, right. So, he's borrowing 360 rupees and paying back 31.50 each month for a year. Wait, so total he's paying back 12 times 31.50. Let me calculate that. 12 * 31.50. Let's see, 31.50 *10 is 315, and 31.50*2 is 63, so total is 378. So he pays back 378 rupees in total.\n\nSo the total amount he repays is 378, and he borrowed 360. So the extra amount is 378-360 = 18 rupees. That's the interest over the year. So the interest is 18 rupees on 360.\n\nWait, but what's the interest rate? Since it's over a year, but paid monthly, I guess it's an annual rate. So the interest rate would be (Interest / Principal) * 100. So 18 / 360 = 0.05. 0.05 *100 is 5%. So that's 5%, which is option D.\n\nWait, but is it that straightforward? Because sometimes when you have installments, especially if the interest is being compounded monthly, the calculation might be a bit different. Oh wait, but in this case, the installments are equal, so maybe it's simple interest or perhaps it's using the concept of installment loans.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it as the effective interest rate. Let me think. The simple way is that he pays 378 in total, so the total interest is 18. So 18 is the interest over 360. So 18/360 is 5%. So that would make D the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider it as the rate per month and then convert it to an annual rate. Let me see. So if the installments are monthly, maybe the interest is calculated monthly. Wait, but the question is asking for the interest rate, which is probably annual.\n\nWait, so perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for installment loans. The formula for the monthly installment when the interest is simple is:\n\nE = P * (r*(1+r)^n) / ((1+r)^n - 1)\n\nWhere E is the monthly installment, P is the principal, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of months.\n\nSo in this case, E is 31.50, P is 360, n=12.\n\nSo plugging in the values:\n\n31.50 = 360 * (r*(1+r)^12) / ((1+r)^12 - 1)\n\nHmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can solve for r.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approximate. Let's see, the total interest is 18, which is 5% of 360. But wait, if it's simple interest, then the annual interest rate would be 5%, which matches our initial calculation.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the interest is calculated differently. Like, maybe each installment includes both principal and interest, and the interest is calculated on the remaining principal each month. That would be more like reducing balance, which is more complex.\n\nWait, but if it's reducing balance, the calculation becomes more involved. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes simple interest, so the initial approach is correct.\n\nWait, but let's see. If the total interest is 18 over 360, that's 5% per annum. So that would be D.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should calculate the effective interest rate considering the time value of money. Because he's paying installments, each payment reduces the principal over time.\n\nWait, another approach. Let's say the total amount paid is 378, which includes the principal plus interest. The principal is 360, so 18 is the interest. But when you're paying installments, the interest is effectively on the average amount owed.\n\nAlternatively, the average amount he owes is (360 + (360 - 12*31.50 )) / 2. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let's think: each month he pays 31.50, so the first payment would be part principal and part interest. The exact split depends on the interest rate.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the question is expecting the simple interest approach, which gives 5% as the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check if 5% is one of the options. Yes, D is 5%.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is D)5%.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where a man borrows Rs. 360 and pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs. 31.50 each. The question is asking what the interest rate is. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you pay back a loan in installments, especially when the installments are the same each month, it's usually an amortized loan. That means each payment covers the interest for the period and reduces the principal. But wait, the interest rate here is probably simple interest because the problem is pretty straightforward, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think about both possibilities.\n\nWait, the options given are 1.5%, 4.5%, 10%, 5%, and 12%. So the interest rate is likely simple interest because that's more common in such problems unless stated otherwise.\n\nLet me outline what I know. The principal amount (P) is Rs. 360. The total amount he pays back is 12 installments of Rs.31.50 each. So the total amount paid (A) is 12 * 31.50. Let me calculate that.\n\n12 * 31.50 = 378. So he pays back a total of Rs. 378. That means the total interest (I) is A - P = 378 - 360 = 18. So the interest is Rs.18 over the 12 months.\n\nNow, if this is simple interest, the formula is I = P * R * T, where R is the annual interest rate, and T is the time in years. Here, the time is 1 year because 12 months is a year. So plugging in the numbers:\n\n18 = 360 * R * 1\n\nSo R = 18 / 360 = 0.05, which is 5%. Oh wait, but wait a second. That would make the interest rate 5% per annum. Let me check the options. Option D is 5%, which would seem to be the answer.\n\nBut wait, another thought. What if the installments are reducing the principal each month, and the interest is calculated on the remaining principal each month? Then it might not be simple interest. That's more complicated, and perhaps it's compound interest, but on a monthly reducing basis. Hmm.\n\nIn that case, the calculation would be different. Let me think about how that would work. Each month, the man pays Rs.31.50, part of which goes towards the principal and part towards the interest. The interest each month is calculated on the outstanding principal.\n\nWait, but without knowing the interest rate, how can I compute that? Because this would involve setting up an equation where each installment reduces the principal and the interest, and the sum of the present values of all installments equals the principal.\n\nThe formula for the monthly installment (E) in such a case is E = P * (r(1+r)^n) / ((1+r)^n - 1), where r is the monthly interest rate and n is the number of installments.\n\nWait, so if I can rearrange this equation to solve for r, I can find the monthly rate, then multiply by 12 to get the annual rate.\n\nBut solving for r is tricky because it's in the exponent. Maybe I can plug in the options to see which one works.\n\nLet me try option D first, which is 5% per annum. So the monthly rate would be 5% /12 \u2248 0.0041667.\n\nSo plugging into the formula:\n\nE = 360 * (0.0041667*(1+0.0041667)^12) / ((1+0.0041667)^12 -1 )\n\nLet me compute (1 + 0.0041667)^12. Let me calculate it step by step.\n\nFirst, 0.0041667 is 5/1200. So 1 + 5/1200 = 1205/1200 = approx 1.0041667.\n\nCalculating (1.0041667)^12. Let me think, I know that (1 + r)^n can be approximated using the formula for compound interest. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the rule of 72 or something, but maybe I should compute it numerically.\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps I can compute the denominator and numerator step by step.\n\nBut maybe an easier approach is to compute the monthly installment E and see if it comes to 31.50.\n\nLet me compute (1.0041667)^12.\n\nWe can compute this as e^(12 * ln(1.0041667)). Let me approximate ln(1.0041667) \u2248 0.004158 (since ln(1+x) \u2248 x - x\u00b2/2 + ... for small x).\n\nSo 12 * 0.004158 \u2248 0.0499.\n\ne^0.0499 \u2248 1.05127.\n\nSo the denominator is 1.05127 - 1 = 0.05127.\n\nThe numerator is 0.0041667 * 1.05127 \u2248 0.004383.\n\nSo E = 360 * (0.004383) / 0.05127.\n\nCompute numerator: 0.004383 / 0.05127 \u2248 0.08546.\n\nMultiply by 360: 360 * 0.08546 \u2248 30.765.\n\nBut the actual installment is 31.50, which is higher. So 5% per annum gives an installment of about 30.76, which is less than 31.50. So the actual interest rate must be higher than 5% because a higher rate would require higher monthly payments.\n\nSo let's try option E, which is 12%. So the monthly rate is 12% /12 = 1% per month.\n\nSo r = 0.01.\n\nNow compute E:\n\nE = 360 * (0.01*(1.01)^12) / ((1.01)^12 -1 )\n\nCompute (1.01)^12. 1.01^12 is approximately 1.126825.\n\nSo denominator: 1.126825 -1 = 0.126825.\n\nNumerator: 0.01 * 1.126825 = 0.01126825.\n\nE = 360 * (0.01126825) / 0.126825.\n\nCompute 0.01126825 / 0.126825 \u2248 0.0889.\n\nMultiply by 360: 360 * 0.0889 \u2248 32.004.\n\nBut the required E is 31.50, which is less than 32. So 12% is too high. Hmm, so the correct rate is between 5% and 12%.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the simple interest calculation, I got 5%. But when I checked using the installment formula, 5% gives E \u224830.765, which is less than 31.50. So perhaps the interest is calculated as simple, but maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be simple interest, and the correct answer is 5%. Let me think again.\n\nIn the simple interest scenario, the total interest is 18 over 12 months, which is 1 year. So the annual rate is 18/360 = 0.05 =5%, which is option D. So that's straightforward.\n\nBut why does the installment method give a different result? Because in that case, the calculation assumes compound interest, and the rate comes out higher than 5% to meet the higher payment.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is intended to be simple interest. Let me think: when a person pays in equal monthly installments, the interest is usually calculated on the reducing balance, which would be compound interest. But perhaps the problem is simplifying things and treating it as simple interest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using simple interest, so the answer is 5%, which is D.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because when I applied the installment formula with 5%, the payment was lower than 31.50. So the actual rate must be higher than 5% if it's compound interest.\n\nBut the options don't include a rate higher than 12%. So perhaps the question expects us to compute using simple interest, leading to 5%.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation for 5% in the installment method. Let me double-check that.\n\nUsing 5% per annum, so monthly rate is 0.0041667.\n\n(1 + r)^n = (1.0041667)^12.\n\nLet me compute that more accurately.\n\nI can compute (1.0041667)^12 step by step.\n\n1.0041667^1 =1.0041667\n\n^2 = (1.0041667)^2 \u22481.008354\n\n^3 =1.008354 *1.0041667 \u22481.01256\n\n^4 =1.01256 *1.0041667 \u22481.01683\n\n^5 \u22481.01683 *1.0041667 \u22481.02113\n\n^6\u22481.02113 *1.0041667\u22481.02547\n\n^7\u22481.02547 *1.0041667\u22481.02986\n\n^8\u22481.02986 *1.0041667\u22481.03431\n\n^9\u22481.03431 *1.0041667\u22481.03882\n\n^10\u22481.03882 *1.0041667\u22481.04338\n\n^11\u22481.04338 *1.0041667\u22481.04799\n\n^12\u22481.04799 *1.0041667\u22481.052605.\n\nSo (1.0041667)^12 \u22481.052605.\n\nSo denominator is 1.052605 -1 =0.052605.\n\nNumerator is 0.0041667 *1.052605 \u22480.004393.\n\nSo E=360*(0.004393)/(0.052605) =360*(0.0836).\n\n360 *0.0836 =30.096. Which is about 30.10, which is less than 31.50.\n\nSo that's way off. So using simple interest, the total interest is 18, which is 5% per annum.\n\nBut in the installment method, the payment would be higher if the interest is compounded monthly.\n\nBut the problem says he pays back in 12 installments.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where a man borrows Rs. 360 and pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs. 31.50 each. The question is asking what the interest rate is. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you pay back a loan in installments, especially when the installments are the same each month, it's usually an amortized loan. That means each payment covers the interest for the period and reduces the principal. But wait, the interest rate here is probably simple interest because the problem is pretty straightforward, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think about both possibilities.\n\nWait, the options given are 1.5%, 4.5%, 10%, 5%, and 12%. So the interest rate is likely simple interest because that's more common in such problems unless stated otherwise.\n\nLet me outline what I know. The principal amount (P) is Rs. 360. The total amount he pays back is 12 installments of Rs.31.50 each. So the total amount paid (A) is 12 * 31.50. Let me calculate that.\n\n12 * 31.50 = 378. So he pays back a total of Rs. 378. That means the total interest (I) is A - P = 378 - 360 = 18. So the interest is Rs.18 over the 12 months.\n\nNow, if this is simple interest, the formula is I = P * R * T, where R is the annual interest rate, and T is the time in years. Here, the time is 1 year because 12 months is a year. So plugging in the numbers:\n\n18 = 360 * R * 1\n\nSo R = 18 / 360 = 0.05, which is 5%. Oh wait, but wait a second. That would make the interest rate 5% per annum. Let me check the options. Option D is 5%, which would seem to be the answer.\n\nBut wait, another thought. What if the installments are reducing the principal each month, and the interest is calculated on the remaining principal each month? Then it might not be simple interest. That's more complicated, and perhaps it's compound interest, but on a monthly reducing basis. Hmm.\n\nIn that case, the calculation would be different. Let me think about how that would work. Each month, the man pays Rs.31.50, part of which goes towards the principal and part towards the interest. The interest each month is calculated on the outstanding principal.\n\nWait, but without knowing the interest rate, how can I compute that? Because this would involve setting up an equation where each installment reduces the principal and the interest, and the sum of the present values of all installments equals the principal.\n\nThe formula for the monthly installment (E) in such a case is E = P * (r(1+r)^n) / ((1+r)^n - 1), where r is the monthly interest rate and n is the number of installments.\n\nWait, so if I can rearrange this equation to solve for r, I can find the monthly rate, then multiply by 12 to get the annual rate.\n\nBut solving for r is tricky because it's in the exponent. Maybe I can plug in the options to see which one works.\n\nLet me try option D first, which is 5% per annum. So the monthly rate would be 5% /12 \u2248 0.0041667.\n\nSo plugging into the formula:\n\nE = 360 * (0.0041667*(1+0.0041667)^12) / ((1+0.0041667)^12 -1 )\n\nLet me compute (1 + 0.0041667)^12. Let me calculate it step by step.\n\nFirst, 0.0041667 is 5/1200. So 1 + 5/1200 = 1205/1200 = approx 1.0041667.\n\nCalculating (1.0041667)^12. Let me think, I know that (1 + r)^n can be approximated using the formula for compound interest. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the rule of 72 or something, but maybe I should compute it numerically.\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps I can compute the denominator and numerator step by step.\n\nBut maybe an easier approach is to compute the monthly installment E and see if it comes to 31.50.\n\nLet me compute (1.0041667)^12.\n\nWe can compute this as e^(12 * ln(1.0041667)). Let me approximate ln(1.0041667) \u2248 0.004158 (since ln(1+x) \u2248 x - x\u00b2/2 + ... for small x).\n\nSo 12 * 0.004158 \u2248 0.0499.\n\ne^0.0499 \u2248 1.05127.\n\nSo the denominator is 1.05127 - 1 = 0.05127.\n\nThe numerator is 0.0041667 * 1.05127 \u2248 0.004383.\n\nSo E = 360 * (0.004383) / 0.05127.\n\nCompute numerator: 0.004383 / 0.05127 \u2248 0.08546.\n\nMultiply by 360: 360 * 0.08546 \u2248 30.765.\n\nBut the actual installment is 31.50, which is higher. So 5% per annum gives an installment of about 30.76, which is less than 31.50. So the actual interest rate must be higher than 5% because a higher rate would require higher monthly payments.\n\nSo let's try option E, which is 12%. So the monthly rate is 12% /12 = 1% per month.\n\nSo r = 0.01.\n\nNow compute E:\n\nE = 360 * (0.01*(1.01)^12) / ((1.01)^12 -1 )\n\nCompute (1.01)^12. 1.01^12 is approximately 1.126825.\n\nSo denominator: 1.126825 -1 = 0.126825.\n\nNumerator: 0.01 * 1.126825 = 0.01126825.\n\nE = 360 * (0.01126825) / 0.126825.\n\nCompute 0.01126825 / 0.126825 \u2248 0.0889.\n\nMultiply by 360: 360 * 0.0889 \u2248 32.004.\n\nBut the required E is 31.50, which is less than 32. So 12% is too high. Hmm, so the correct rate is between 5% and 12%.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the simple interest calculation, I got 5%. But when I checked using the installment formula, 5% gives E \u224830.765, which is less than 31.50.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a man borrowing money and paying it back with installments. I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of calculations, but I'll try to think it through step by step.\n\nThe question says he borrows Rs.360 and pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50 each. I need to find the interest rate. Hmm, so he's paying back a total of 12 times 31.50, right? Let me calculate that. 12 multiplied by 31.50. Let me see, 31.50 * 10 is 315, and 31.50 *2 is 63, so 315 +63= 378. So he's paying back 378 in total.\n\nWait, so he borrowed 360 and paid back 378. The difference is 378 - 360 = 18. So the total interest paid is 18 rupees over 12 months. That means the interest per month is 18 divided by 12, which is 1.5 rupees per month. \n\nWait, but how does that translate to an interest rate? Oh right, interest rates are usually annual rates, so I think I need to calculate the annual interest based on the monthly interest. But wait, wait. Let me make sure I'm approaching this correctly.\n\nAnother approach is to think about this as a simple interest problem. Simple interest is calculated as Principal \u00d7 Rate \u00d7 Time. But wait, in this case, the installments are each month, so the time isn't just one year but spread out over 12 months. Hmm.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The problem here is that the person is paying back in installments, so it's not simple interest; it's probably more like an annuity or installment loan calculation. Because in a simple interest scenario, you pay the same amount each period, but the time each portion of the principal is borrowed for varies.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to model this as a flat interest rate. The total interest is 18 over the principal of 360. So the rate would be (18 / 360) \u00d7 100. Let me calculate that. 18 divided by 360 is 0.05, so 5%. Oh wait, but that's the total interest over the period of the loan. Since the period is 12 months, is this an annual rate?\n\nWait, let me think. If the total interest is 5% of the principal over a year, then the annual interest rate would be 5%, right? Because 5% of 360 is 18, which is exactly the total interest paid.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. Because when you pay in installments, each installment includes part principal and part interest. So the interest isn't just simple interest on the initial amount. Instead, each month, you're paying off part of the principal, which reduces the amount of interest for the following months.\n\nHmm, so maybe I should calculate the effective interest rate using the concept of present value of annuities. Because each installment is a payment, and the total present value (the loan amount) is 360.\n\nThe formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is:\nPV = PMT \u00d7 [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r]\n\nWhere:\nPV = present value (360)\nPMT = monthly payment (31.50)\nr = monthly interest rate\nn = number of periods (12)\n\nI need to solve for r. Once I find the monthly rate, I can multiply by 12 to get the annual rate, or perhaps the question is asking for the annual rate, so I need to clarify that.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about the formula direction. Let me rearrange it. So 360 = 31.50 \u00d7 [(1 - (1 + r)^-12) / r]\n\nI can rearrange this equation to solve for r, but that's not straightforward algebraically. Maybe I can approximate or use trial and error with the options given.\n\nThe options for the interest rate are A)1.5%, B)4.5%, C)10%, D)5%, E)12%. So the options are given as annual rates, I think.\n\nWait, but wait. If the options are annual rates, then the monthly rate would be the annual rate divided by 12. So let me try each option as the annual rate and see which one gives a PV close to 360 when calculating the present value of the 12 installments.\n\nLet me start with option D: 5% annual rate. So the monthly rate is 5% / 12 \u2248 0.0041667.\n\nPlugging into the PV formula:\n\nPV = 31.50 \u00d7 [ (1 - (1 + 0.0041667)^-12 ) / 0.0041667 ]\n\nLet me compute (1 + 0.0041667)^12 first. Using the approximation (1 + r)^n \u2248 e^(rn) for small r, but maybe I'll just compute it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute (1 + 0.0041667) = 1.0041667.\n\nRaise this to the 12th power:\n\nLet me compute 1.0041667^12. Hmm. Let me think, since 0.0041667 is 1/240, but 12 months so perhaps it's better to compute step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for compound interest: (1 + r)^n.\n\nBut maybe I can approximate this. Let me compute 1.0041667^12.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate it as follows:\n\nWe know that (1 + r)^n \u2248 1 + nr + (n(n-1)/2) r^2 + ... for small r. But perhaps it's easier to compute step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps using a calculator approach:\n\nCompute 1.0041667^12:\n\nLet me compute the value step by step.\n\nLet me compute each month:\n\nAfter 1st month: 1.0041667\nAfter 2nd month: (1.0041667)^2 \u2248 1.008354167\nAfter 3rd month: 1.0125375 (approx)\nWait, perhaps this is getting too time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for (1 + r)^n = e^(n ln(1 + r)).\n\nBut perhaps it's better to use an approximate method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the present value factor for an ordinary annuity.\n\nAt 5% annual rate, the monthly rate is 0.4166667%. Let's compute the present value factor:\n\n[(1 - (1 + r)^-12) / r] where r is 0.0041667.\n\nCompute (1 + r)^-12 = 1 / (1.0041667)^12. Let me compute 1.0041667^12.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation for small r: (1 + r)^n \u2248 1 + nr + (n^2 r^2)/2.\n\nBut for more accuracy, perhaps I can compute it more accurately.\n\nLet me compute (1.0041667)^12:\n\n1.0041667^1 = 1.0041667\n^2 = (1.0041667)^2 = approximately 1.008354167\n^3 \u2248 1.0125375 (1.008354167 * 1.0041667)\n^4 \u2248 1.016711 (approx)\nWait, but this is getting tedious. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for an approximate value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute this using logarithms.\n\nln(1.0041667) \u2248 0.004158.\n\nMultiply by 12: 0.049896.\n\ne^0.049896 \u2248 1.05127.\n\nSo (1.0041667)^12 \u2248 1.05127.\n\nThus, (1.0041667)^-12 \u2248 1/1.05127 \u2248 0.95117.\n\nSo 1 - 0.95117 = 0.04883.\n\nDivide by r (0.0041667):\n\n0.04883 / 0.0041667 \u2248 11.71.\n\nSo the present value factor is approximately 11.71.\n\nSo the present value PV = 31.50 * 11.71 \u2248 31.5 * 11.71.\n\nLet me compute that: 30 * 11.71 = 351.3, 1.5 * 11.71 = 17.565. So total approx 351.3 +17.565=368.865.\n\nWait, but the present value is supposed to be 360. So with a 5% rate, the PV is around 368.87, which is higher than 360. That suggests that the actual rate is higher than 5% because a higher rate would reduce the present value.\n\nWait, but this doesn't make sense because if the rate increases, the present value factor decreases, so the PV would be lower. Hmm, but in our case, the calculated PV is higher than the loan amount (360), which suggests that the rate is lower than 5%, because at a lower rate, the present value would be higher.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. The formula is PV = PMT \u00d7 [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]\n\nIf the present value is 360, and the PMT is 31.50, and n=12, then for a given r, the present value will be 31.50 multiplied by the annuity factor.\n\nIf I plug r=0.0041667 (5% annual rate), I get a PV of about 368.87, which is higher than 360. So that suggests that the actual rate is higher than 5%, because at a higher rate, the annuity factor (the denominator) would be lower, so the PV would be lower.\n\nWait, because when r increases, the denominator increases, but (1 - (1 + r)^-n) decreases as r increases. Let me see, maybe it's better to do an iterative approach.\n\nWait, but maybe I should try another option, perhaps option E is 12%, which would be a much higher rate.\n\nBut maybe let's try option B: 4.5% annual rate.\n\nSo r would be 4.5% /12 = 0.00375 per month.\n\nCompute the annuity factor: (1 - (1.00375)^-12 ) / 0.00375.\n\nCompute (1.00375)^12.\n\nAgain, perhaps using the same approximation method.\n\nln(1.00375) \u2248 0.003743.\n\nMultiply by 12: 0.044916.\n\ne^0.044916 \u2248 1.04613.\n\nSo (1.00375)^12 \u2248 1.04613, so (1.00375)^-12 \u2248 1/1.04613 \u2248 0.9558.\n\nSo 1 - 0.9558 = 0.0442.\n\nDivide by 0.00375: 0.0442 / 0.00375 \u2248 11.7867.\n\nSo PV = 31.50 * 11.7867 \u2248 31.5 * 11.7867 \u2248 Let's compute 30 *11.7867 = 353.601, 1.5 *11.7867=17.68, total \u2248 353.6 +17.68=371.28.\n\nBut the PV is supposed to be 360. So 371.28 is higher than 360. So with 4.5% annual rate, the PV is 371.28, which is higher than 360. So the required rate must be higher than 4.5% because a higher rate would lower the PV.\n\nWait, but when I tried 5%, the PV was 368.87, which is closer to 360 than 371.28. So perhaps the correct rate is a bit higher than 5%? But 5% is one of the options (option D). Hmm.\n\nWait, but let's try option E, which is 12% annual rate. Then the monthly rate is 1% (12/12).\n\nSo r=0.01.\n\nCompute (1.01)^12. Let me compute that. 1.01^12 is approximately 1.126825.\n\nSo (1.01)^-12 \u2248 1/1.126825 \u2248 0.888.\n\nSo 1 - 0.888 = 0.112.\n\nDivide by 0.01: 0.112 /0.01=11.2.\n\nSo PV =31.50 * 11.2 = 352.8.\n\nWhich is lower than 360. So the PV is 352.8, which is less than 360. So at 12% annual rate, PV is 352.8.\n\nWait, but we need PV=360. So the correct rate is somewhere between 5% and 12%. But 5% gives PV=368.87, 12% gives PV=352.8. We need PV=360, which is between 352.8 and 368.87, so the rate would be between 5% and 12%.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, the options are A)1.5%, B)4.5%, C)10%, D)5%, E)12%.\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer is option D, 5%, but according to my previous calculation, the PV at 5% is 368.87, which is higher than 360. So perhaps the correct rate is higher than 5%. Let me think.\n\nWait, maybe I should try option C, which is 10% annual rate. So monthly rate is 10/120 = 0.0083333.\n\nCompute (1.0083333)^12.\n\nAgain, using the same method. ln(1.0083333) \u2248 0.008299.\n\nMultiply by 12: 0.09959.\n\ne^0.09959 \u2248 1.1045.\n\nSo (1.0083333)^12 \u2248 1.1045, so (1.0083333)^-12 \u2248 1/1.1045 \u2248 0.905.\n\nSo 1 - 0.905 = 0.095.\n\nDivide by 0.0083333: 0.095 / 0.0083333 \u2248 11.4.\n\nSo PV =31.50 *11.4 = 358.1.\n\nThat's close to 360. So at 10% annual rate, the PV is approximately 358.1, which is very close to 360. So the actual rate must be slightly higher than 10%. But 10% is one of the options (option C).\n\nWait, but the options don't have a rate between 10% and 12%, except for E, which is 12%. But in our calculation, at 10%, PV is 358.1, which is just 1.9 less than 360. So perhaps the correct rate is approximately 10%.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should refine this calculation. Let me try a rate of 9.5% annual, which would be 0.0079167 per month.\n\nCompute (1.0079167)^12.\n\nln(1.0079167) \u2248 0.00788.\n\nMultiply by 12: 0.09456.\n\ne^0.09456 \u2248 1.0987.\n\nSo (1.0079167)^12 \u2248 1.0987, so (1.0079167)^-12 \u2248 1/1.0987 \u2248 0.910.\n\n1 - 0.910 = 0.09.\n\nDivide by 0.0079167: 0.09 / 0.0079167 \u2248 11.37.\n\nSo PV =31.5 * 11.37 \u2248 31.5 *11 =346.5, 31.5 *0.37\u224811.655. Total\u2248358.155.\n\nHmm, that's similar to what I had at 10%. So perhaps I need to find the exact rate where PV equals 360.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and the question is intended to be solved using simple interest.\n\nWait, in the simple interest approach, the total interest is 378 - 360 = 18.\n\nSo total interest is 18 over 360, which is 5% per annum. Because 18 is 5% of 360. So the rate would be 5% (option D). \n\nBut wait, in reality, when you pay back in installments, the interest isn't simple. It's more accurate to use the present value of annuity method. But perhaps the question expects the simple interest approach.\n\nSo perhaps the answer is D)5%.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. If it's a simple interest calculation, then the interest is calculated on the initial principal for the entire period.\n\nSo simple interest formula: I = P \u00d7 r \u00d7 t.\n\nHere, I is 18, P is 360, t is 1 year.\n\nSo r = I/(P*t) = 18/(360*1) = 0.05 or 5%.\n\nSo that would make the answer D)5%.\n\nBut earlier, using the present value approach, I found that the rate needed to be around 10% to get a PV of 360, but that's probably because the present value approach accounts for the fact that the borrower is paying back the loan in installments, reducing the principal each month, thus effectively reducing the interest over time.\n\nSo why the discrepancy? Because depending on how the interest is calculated, the rate can vary. If it's simple interest, the rate is 5%, but if it's based on present value ( installment plan), the rate is higher, around 10%.\n\nBut looking at the options, option C is 10%, which is the rate we approached with the present value method.\n\nWait, but the problem says the man pays back in 12 monthly installments. So this is an installment loan, which implies that the interest is calculated using the annuity method. So the correct approach is the present value one, and the interest rate would be around 10%, which is option C.\n\nBut why does the simple interest approach give a different answer?\n\nBecause in the simple interest approach, the interest is calculated only on the initial principal for the entire period, which isn't how installment loans typically work. Installment loans usually involve reducing the principal each period, which affects the interest calculation.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is the present value method, leading to an interest rate of approximately 10%, which is option C.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried 10% annual rate, the PV came to about 358, which is very close to 360. So that suggests the correct rate is around 10%, making option C the answer.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because the simple interest approach gives 5%, which is option D. So I'm not sure which method the question expects.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not considering the time value of money and is simply expecting the simple interest calculation. That would make the answer 5%, option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is assuming flat interest rate, where the total interest is 18, so 18/360=5% per annum.\n\nSo in that case, the answer would be D)5%.\n\nBut I'm a bit torn because the correct way to calculate the interest rate for installments is the present value method, which suggests a higher rate. But perhaps the question is intended to be solved using simple interest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the present value calculation. Let me recheck the 10% calculation.\n\nAt 10% annual rate, the monthly rate is 0.0083333.\n\nCompute (1.0083333)^12.\n\nLet me compute this more accurately.\n\nWe can compute (1.0083333)^12:\n\n1.0083333^1 = 1.0083333\n^2 = 1.0083333 * 1.0083333 \u2248 1.0167361\n^3 \u2248 1.0167361 *1.0083333 \u2248 1.0250417\n^4 \u2248 1.0250417 *1.0083333 \u2248 1.033403\n^5 \u2248 1.033403 *1.0083333 \u2248 1.041832\n^6 \u2248 1.041832 *1.0083333 \u2248 1.050362\n^7 \u2248 1.050362 *1.0083333 \u2248 1.059006\n^8 \u2248 1.059006 *1.0083333 \u2248 1.067787\n^9 \u2248 1.067787 *1.0083333 \u2248 1.076726\n^10\u22481.076726 *1.0083333\u22481.085827\n^11\u22481.085827 *1.0083333\u22481.095098\n^12\u22481.095098 *1.0083333\u22481.104389\n\nSo (1.0083333)^12 \u2248 1.104389.\n\nSo (1.0083333)^-12 = 1/1.104389 \u2248 0.9054.\n\nSo 1 - 0.9054 = 0.0946.\n\nDivide by 0.0083333: 0.0946 /0.0083333 \u2248 11.30.\n\nSo PV =31.50 * 11.30 = 31.5 *11 =346.5 + 31.5 *0.3=9.45 \u2192 total 355.95.\n\nHmm, but that's less than 360. So perhaps the actual rate is a bit lower than 10%, maybe around 9.5% as I tried before.\n\nWait, but with 10% giving a PV of about 355.95, which is lower than 360, I'm getting a bit stuck. Earlier, at 5%, the PV was 368.87, which is higher than 360. So the rate must be between 5% and 10%.\n\nWait, perhaps I should set up the equation and solve for r numerically.\n\nWe have 360 = 31.50 \u00d7 [ (1 - (1 + r)^-12 ) / r ]\n\nWe can rearrange this as 360 /31.50 = [ (1 - (1 + r)^-12 ) / r ]\n\n360 divided by 31.50 is 11.42857.\n\nSo,\n\n(1 - (1 + r)^-12 ) / r = 11.42857.\n\nWe can try r =0.005 (which is 5% annual rate, 0.416667% monthly).\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, r is the monthly rate. So let me correct.\n\nWait, the equation uses r as the monthly rate. So if the annual rate is 5%, the monthly rate is 5/12% \u2248 0.0041667.\n\nSo let's plug r=0.0041667 into the equation.\n\n(1 - (1.0041667)^-12 ) / 0.0041667 \u2248 (1 - 0.95117) / 0.0041667 \u2248 0.04883 / 0.0041667 \u2248 11.71.\n\nWhich is higher than 11.42857, which suggests that the required r is higher than 0.0041667 (5% annual rate), because as r increases, the denominator increases, and (1 + r)^-12 decreases, so the numerator increases. Wait, no, actually, let me think again.\n\nWait, as the monthly rate r increases, (1 + r)^-12 decreases, so 1 - (1 + r)^-12 increases. So the numerator increases, and the denominator also increases. So the overall effect depends on which increases more.\n\nIn any case, at r=0.0041667 (5% annual), the factor is 11.71, which is higher than 11.42857. So we need a higher r to get a lower factor. Wait, no. Because if the factor is 11.71, which is higher than 11.42857, that would mean that for a higher r, the factor could be lower. So perhaps I need to find a higher r to get a lower factor.\n\nWait, let's try r=0.005 (which is 0.5% monthly, 6% annual rate).\n\nCompute (1.005)^12.\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\n1.005^1 =1.005\n^2=1.010025\n^3=1.015075\n^4=1.020150\n^5=1.02525\n^6=1.030378\n^7=1.035516\n^8=1.040708\n^9=1.045936\n^10=1.051209\n^11=1.056537\n^12=1.061894.\n\nSo (1.005)^12\u22481.061894. So (1.005)^-12 \u2248 1/1.061894\u22480.9417.\n\nSo 1 - 0.9417 = 0.0583.\n\nDivide by 0.005: 0.0583 /0.005=11.66.\n\nWhich is still higher than 11.42857. So the factor is 11.66 at r=0.005, which is higher than our target of 11.42857.\n\nSo we need a higher r to bring the factor down.\n\nLet me try r=0.006 (6% annual rate).\n\n(1.006)^12.\n\n1.006^12: Let's compute.\n\n1.006^1=1.006\n^2=1.012036\n^3=1.018117\n^4=1.024204\n^5=1.030324\n^6=1.036483\n^7=1.042680\n^8=1.048924\n^9=1.055220\n^10=1.061563\n^11=1.068007\n^12=1.074551.\n\nSo (1.006)^12\u22481.074551. Thus, (1.006)^-12\u22481/1.074551\u22480.9307.\n\nSo 1 - 0.9307=0.0693.\n\nDivide by 0.006: 0.0693 /0.006=11.55.\n\nStill higher than 11.42857.\n\nHmm, so at r=0.006, factor is 11.55.\n\nWe need factor=11.42857.\n\nSo let's try r=0.0065 (7.8% annual rate).\n\nCompute (1.0065)^12.\n\nApproximating:\n\nWe can use logarithms.\n\nln(1.0065)=approx 0.00648.\n\nMultiply by 12: 0.07776.\n\ne^0.07776\u22481.0808.\n\nSo (1.0065)^12\u22481.0808, so (1.0065)^-12\u22480.9253.\n\n1 - 0.9253=0.0747.\n\nDivide by 0.0065: 0.0747/0.0065\u224811.49.\n\nHmm, that's very close to 11.42857.\n\nWait, our target is 11.42857, and at r=0.0065, the factor is 11.49. That's close. So perhaps the exact r is around 0.0066 or so.\n\nBut perhaps for the purposes of this problem, the closest option is 10% annual rate, which gives a factor of approximately 11.30, which is lower than 11.42857.\n\nWait, but wait, 11.42857 is the target. So 11.49 is higher, so the required r would be a bit higher than 0.0065.\n\nBut perhaps the intended approach is the simple interest, giving 5% (option D), which is the total interest over the year.\n\nSo I'm a bit torn here. But given the options, and considering that the present value approach would give a rate around 7.8% (which isn't one of the options), but the simple interest approach gives 5%, which is an option, perhaps the intended answer is D)5%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the present value calculation earlier, and the correct approach is to use simple interest.\n\nWait, another way to look at it: the total amount paid is 378, so the interest is 18, which is 5% of 360. So perhaps the question expects the simple interest approach, making the answer D)5%.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Another thought: perhaps the installments are structured such that each installment's interest is calculated on the remaining principal. But that would make it more complex than simple interest.\n\nHmm. Considering the options and the time I've spent, I think the intended answer is D)5%, using the simple interest method.\n",

The annual interest rate (\\( r \\)) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{\\text{Total Interest}}{\\text{Principal}} \\times 100 = \\frac{18}{360} \\times 100 = 5\\%.\n\\]\n\nThis suggests an annual interest rate of **5%**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Present Value of Annuities Approach**:\nFor installment loans, the interest rate can also be calculated using the present value of an ordinary annuity formula:\n\n\\[\nPV = PMT \\times \\left[ \\frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r} \\right],\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( PV = 360 \\) (present value),\n- \\( PMT = 31.50 \\) (monthly payment),\n- \\( n = 12 \\) (number of periods),\n- \\( r \\) = monthly interest rate.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for \\( r \\) is complex algebraically, so we test the given options for \\( r \\) (annual rates) and calculate the present value factor:\n\n#### Testing Option D (5% Annual Rate):\n- Monthly rate: \\( r = \\frac{5}{12} \\approx 0.0041667 \\),\n- \\( (1 + r)^{-12} \\approx 0.95117 \\),\n- \\( 1 - (1 + r)^{-12} \\approx 0.04883 \\),\n- \\( \\frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-12}}{r} \\approx \\frac{0.04883}{0.0041667} \\approx 11.71 \\),\n- \\( PV = 31.50 \\times 11.71 \\approx 368.87 \\).\n\nThe calculated \\( PV \\) (368.87) is higher than the loan amount (360), indicating the rate is slightly lower than 5%.\n\n#### Testing Option C (10% Annual Rate):\n- Monthly rate: \\( r = \\frac{10}{12} \\approx 0.0083333 \\),\n- \\( (1 + r)^{-12} \\approx 0.905 \\),\n- \\( 1 - (1 + r)^{-12} \\approx 0.095 \\),\n- \\( \\frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-12}}{r} \\approx \\frac{0.095}{0.0083333} \\approx 11.4 \\),\n- \\( PV = 31.50 \\times 11.4 \\approx 358.1 \\).\n\nThe calculated \\( PV \\) (358.1) is lower than the loan amount (360), indicating the rate is slightly higher than 10%.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe present value approach suggests the interest rate is between 5% and 10%. However, the simple interest method directly gives a rate of **5%**, which aligns with the total interest paid (Rs. 18) being 5% of the principal (Rs. 360). Given the options and the problem's context, the intended answer is likely **5%**, as it simplifies the calculation and matches the total interest paid.\n\n**Answer: D**",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a man borrowing money and paying it back with installments. I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of calculations, but I'll try to think it through step by step.\n\nThe question says he borrows Rs.360 and pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50 each. I need to find the interest rate. Hmm, so he's paying back a total of 12 times 31.50, right? Let me calculate that. 12 multiplied by 31.50. Let me see, 31.50 * 10 is 315, and 31.50 *2 is 63, so 315 +63= 378. So he's paying back 378 in total.\n\nWait, so he borrowed 360 and paid back 378. The difference is 378 - 360 = 18. So the total interest paid is 18 rupees over 12 months. That means the interest per month is 18 divided by 12, which is 1.5 rupees per month. \n\nWait, but how does that translate to an interest rate? Oh right, interest rates are usually annual rates, so I think I need to calculate the annual interest based on the monthly interest. But wait, wait. Let me make sure I'm approaching this correctly.\n\nAnother approach is to think about this as a simple interest problem. Simple interest is calculated as Principal \u00d7 Rate \u00d7 Time. But wait, in this case, the installments are each month, so the time isn't just one year but spread out over 12 months. Hmm.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The problem here is that the person is paying back in installments, so it's not simple interest; it's probably more like an annuity or installment loan calculation. Because in a simple interest scenario, you pay the same amount each period, but the time each portion of the principal is borrowed for varies.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to model this as a flat interest rate. The total interest is 18 over the principal of 360. So the rate would be (18 / 360) \u00d7 100. Let me calculate that. 18 divided by 360 is 0.05, so 5%. Oh wait, but that's the total interest over the period of the loan. Since the period is 12 months, is this an annual rate?\n\nWait, let me think. If the total interest is 5% of the principal over a year, then the annual interest rate would be 5%, right? Because 5% of 360 is 18, which is exactly the total interest paid.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. Because when you pay in installments, each installment includes part principal and part interest. So the interest isn't just simple interest on the initial amount. Instead, each month, you're paying off part of the principal, which reduces the amount of interest for the following months.\n\nHmm, so maybe I should calculate the effective interest rate using the concept of present value of annuities. Because each installment is a payment, and the total present value (the loan amount) is 360.\n\nThe formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is:\nPV = PMT \u00d7 [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r]\n\nWhere:\nPV = present value (360)\nPMT = monthly payment (31.50)\nr = monthly interest rate\nn = number of periods (12)\n\nI need to solve for r. Once I find the monthly rate, I can multiply by 12 to get the annual rate, or perhaps the question is asking for the annual rate, so I need to clarify that.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about the formula direction. Let me rearrange it. So 360 = 31.50 \u00d7 [(1 - (1 + r)^-12) / r]\n\nI can rearrange this equation to solve for r, but that's not straightforward algebraically. Maybe I can approximate or use trial and error with the options given.\n\nThe options for the interest rate are A)1.5%, B)4.5%, C)10%, D)5%, E)12%. So the options are given as annual rates, I think.\n\nWait, but wait. If the options are annual rates, then the monthly rate would be the annual rate divided by 12. So let me try each option as the annual rate and see which one gives a PV close to 360 when calculating the present value of the 12 installments.\n\nLet me start with option D: 5% annual rate. So the monthly rate is 5% / 12 \u2248 0.0041667.\n\nPlugging into the PV formula:\n\nPV = 31.50 \u00d7 [ (1 - (1 + 0.0041667)^-12 ) / 0.0041667 ]\n\nLet me compute (1 + 0.0041667)^12 first. Using the approximation (1 + r)^n \u2248 e^(rn) for small r, but maybe I'll just compute it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute (1 + 0.0041667) = 1.0041667.\n\nRaise this to the 12th power:\n\nLet me compute 1.0041667^12. Hmm. Let me think, since 0.0041667 is 1/240, but 12 months so perhaps it's better to compute step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for compound interest: (1 + r)^n.\n\nBut maybe I can approximate this. Let me compute 1.0041667^12.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate it as follows:\n\nWe know that (1 + r)^n \u2248 1 + nr + (n(n-1)/2) r^2 + ... for small r. But perhaps it's easier to compute step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps using a calculator approach:\n\nCompute 1.0041667^12:\n\nLet me compute the value step by step.\n\nLet me compute each month:\n\nAfter 1st month: 1.0041667\nAfter 2nd month: (1.0041667)^2 \u2248 1.008354167\nAfter 3rd month: 1.0125375 (approx)\nWait, perhaps this is getting too time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for (1 + r)^n = e^(n ln(1 + r)).\n\nBut perhaps it's better to use an approximate method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the present value factor for an ordinary annuity.\n\nAt 5% annual rate, the monthly rate is 0.4166667%. Let's compute the present value factor:\n\n[(1 - (1 + r)^-12) / r] where r is 0.0041667.\n\nCompute (1 + r)^-12 = 1 / (1.0041667)^12. Let me compute 1.0041667^12.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation for small r: (1 + r)^n \u2248 1 + nr + (n^2 r^2)/2.\n\nBut for more accuracy, perhaps I can compute it more accurately.\n\nLet me compute (1.0041667)^12:\n\n1.0041667^1 = 1.0041667\n^2 = (1.0041667)^2 = approximately 1.008354167\n^3 \u2248 1.0125375 (1.008354167 * 1.0041667)\n^4 \u2248 1.016711 (approx)\nWait, but this is getting tedious. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for an approximate value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute this using logarithms.\n\nln(1.0041667) \u2248 0.004158.\n\nMultiply by 12: 0.049896.\n\ne^0.049896 \u2248 1.05127.\n\nSo (1.0041667)^12 \u2248 1.05127.\n\nThus, (1.0041667)^-12 \u2248 1/1.05127 \u2248 0.95117.\n\nSo 1 - 0.95117 = 0.04883.\n\nDivide by r (0.0041667):\n\n0.04883 / 0.0041667 \u2248 11.71.\n\nSo the present value factor is approximately 11.71.\n\nSo the present value PV = 31.50 * 11.71 \u2248 31.5 * 11.71.\n\nLet me compute that: 30 * 11.71 = 351.3, 1.5 * 11.71 = 17.565. So total approx 351.3 +17.565=368.865.\n\nWait, but the present value is supposed to be 360. So with a 5% rate, the PV is around 368.87, which is higher than 360. That suggests that the actual rate is higher than 5% because a higher rate would reduce the present value.\n\nWait, but this doesn't make sense because if the rate increases, the present value factor decreases, so the PV would be lower. Hmm, but in our case, the calculated PV is higher than the loan amount (360), which suggests that the rate is lower than 5%, because at a lower rate, the present value would be higher.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. The formula is PV = PMT \u00d7 [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]\n\nIf the present value is 360, and the PMT is 31.50, and n=12, then for a given r, the present value will be 31.50 multiplied by the annuity factor.\n\nIf I plug r=0.0041667 (5% annual rate), I get a PV of about 368.87, which is higher than 360. So that suggests that the actual rate is higher than 5%, because at a higher rate, the annuity factor (the denominator) would be lower, so the PV would be lower.\n\nWait, because when r increases, the denominator increases, but (1 - (1 + r)^-n) decreases as r increases. Let me see, maybe it's better to do an iterative approach.\n\nWait, but maybe I should try another option, perhaps option E is 12%, which would be a much higher rate.\n\nBut maybe let's try option B: 4.5% annual rate.\n\nSo r would be 4.5% /12 = 0.00375 per month.\n\nCompute the annuity factor: (1 - (1.00375)^-12 ) / 0.00375.\n\nCompute (1.00375)^12.\n\nAgain, perhaps using the same approximation method.\n\nln(1.00375) \u2248 0.003743.\n\nMultiply by 12: 0.044916.\n\ne^0.044916 \u2248 1.04613.\n\nSo (1.00375)^12 \u2248 1.04613, so (1.00375)^-12 \u2248 1/1.04613 \u2248 0.9558.\n\nSo 1 - 0.9558 = 0.0442.\n\nDivide by 0.00375: 0.0442 / 0.00375 \u2248 11.7867.\n\nSo PV = 31.50 * 11.7867 \u2248 31.5 * 11.7867 \u2248 Let's compute 30 *11.7867 = 353.601, 1.5 *11.7867=17.68, total \u2248 353.6 +17.68=371.28.\n\nBut the PV is supposed to be 360. So 371.28 is higher than 360. So with 4.5% annual rate, the PV is 371.28, which is higher than 360. So the required rate must be higher than 4.5% because a higher rate would lower the PV.\n\nWait, but when I tried 5%, the PV was 368.87, which is closer to 360 than 371.28. So perhaps the correct rate is a bit higher than 5%? But 5% is one of the options (option D). Hmm.\n\nWait, but let's try option E, which is 12% annual rate. Then the monthly rate is 1% (12/12).\n\nSo r=0.01.\n\nCompute (1.01)^12. Let me compute that. 1.01^12 is approximately 1.126825.\n\nSo (1.01)^-12 \u2248 1/1.126825 \u2248 0.888.\n\nSo 1 - 0.888 = 0.112.\n\nDivide by 0.01: 0.112 /0.01=11.2.\n\nSo PV =31.50 * 11.2 = 352.8.\n\nWhich is lower than 360. So the PV is 352.8, which is less than 360. So at 12% annual rate, PV is 352.8.\n\nWait, but we need PV=360. So the correct rate is somewhere between 5% and 12%. But 5% gives PV=368.87, 12% gives PV=352.8. We need PV=360, which is between 352.8 and 368.87, so the rate would be between 5% and 12%.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, the options are A)1.5%, B)4.5%, C)10%, D)5%, E)12%.\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer is option D, 5%, but according to my previous calculation, the PV at 5% is 368.87, which is higher than 360. So perhaps the correct rate is higher than 5%. Let me think.\n\nWait, maybe I should try option C, which is 10% annual rate. So monthly rate is 10/120 = 0.0083333.\n\nCompute (1.0083333)^12.\n\nAgain, using the same method. ln(1.0083333) \u2248 0.008299.\n\nMultiply by 12: 0.09959.\n\ne^0.09959 \u2248 1.1045.\n\nSo (1.0083333)^12 \u2248 1.1045, so (1.0083333)^-12 \u2248 1/1.1045 \u2248 0.905.\n\nSo 1 - 0.905 = 0.095.\n\nDivide by 0.0083333: 0.095 / 0.0083333 \u2248 11.4.\n\nSo PV =31.50 *11.4 = 358.1.\n\nThat's close to 360. So at 10% annual rate, the PV is approximately 358.1, which is very close to 360. So the actual rate must be slightly higher than 10%. But 10% is one of the options (option C).\n\nWait, but the options don't have a rate between 10% and 12%, except for E, which is 12%. But in our calculation, at 10%, PV is 358.1, which is just 1.9 less than 360. So perhaps the correct rate is approximately 10%.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should refine this calculation. Let me try a rate of 9.5% annual, which would be 0.0079167 per month.\n\nCompute (1.0079167)^12.\n\nln(1.0079167) \u2248 0.00788.\n\nMultiply by 12: 0.09456.\n\ne^0.09456 \u2248 1.0987.\n\nSo (1.0079167)^12 \u2248 1.0987, so (1.0079167)^-12 \u2248 1/1.0987 \u2248 0.910.\n\n1 - 0.910 = 0.09.\n\nDivide by 0.0079167: 0.09 / 0.0079167 \u2248 11.37.\n\nSo PV =31.5 * 11.37 \u2248 31.5 *11 =346.5, 31.5 *0.37\u224811.655. Total\u2248358.155.\n\nHmm, that's similar to what I had at 10%. So perhaps I need to find the exact rate where PV equals 360.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and the question is intended to be solved using simple interest.\n\nWait, in the simple interest approach, the total interest is 378 - 360 = 18.\n\nSo total interest is 18 over 360, which is 5% per annum. Because 18 is 5% of 360. So the rate would be 5% (option D). \n\nBut wait, in reality, when you pay back in installments, the interest isn't simple. It's more accurate to use the present value of annuity method. But perhaps the question expects the simple interest approach.\n\nSo perhaps the answer is D)5%.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. If it's a simple interest calculation, then the interest is calculated on the initial principal for the entire period.\n\nSo simple interest formula: I = P \u00d7 r \u00d7 t.\n\nHere, I is 18, P is 360, t is 1 year.\n\nSo r = I/(P*t) = 18/(360*1) = 0.05 or 5%.\n\nSo that would make the answer D)5%.\n\nBut earlier, using the present value approach, I found that the rate needed to be around 10% to get a PV of 360, but that's probably because the present value approach accounts for the fact that the borrower is paying back the loan in installments, reducing the principal each month, thus effectively reducing the interest over time.\n\nSo why the discrepancy? Because depending on how the interest is calculated, the rate can vary. If it's simple interest, the rate is 5%, but if it's based on present value ( installment plan), the rate is higher, around 10%.\n\nBut looking at the options, option C is 10%, which is the rate we approached with the present value method.\n\nWait, but the problem says the man pays back in 12 monthly installments. So this is an installment loan, which implies that the interest is calculated using the annuity method. So the correct approach is the present value one, and the interest rate would be around 10%, which is option C.\n\nBut why does the simple interest approach give a different answer?\n\nBecause in the simple interest approach, the interest is calculated only on the initial principal for the entire period, which isn't how installment loans typically work. Installment loans usually involve reducing the principal each period, which affects the interest calculation.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is the present value method, leading to an interest rate of approximately 10%, which is option C.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried 10% annual rate, the PV came to about 358, which is very close to 360. So that suggests the correct rate is around 10%, making option C the answer.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because the simple interest approach gives 5%, which is option D. So I'm not sure which method the question expects.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not considering the time value of money and is simply expecting the simple interest calculation. That would make the answer 5%, option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is assuming flat interest rate, where the total interest is 18, so 18/360=5% per annum.\n\nSo in that case, the answer would be D)5%.\n\nBut I'm a bit torn because the correct way to calculate the interest rate for installments is the present value method, which suggests a higher rate. But perhaps the question is intended to be solved using simple interest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the present value calculation. Let me recheck the 10% calculation.\n\nAt 10% annual rate, the monthly rate is 0.0083333.\n\nCompute (1.0083333)^12.\n\nLet me compute this more accurately.\n\nWe can compute (1.0083333)^12:\n\n1.0083333^1 = 1.0083333\n^2 = 1.0083333 * 1.0083333 \u2248 1.0167361\n^3 \u2248 1.0167361 *1.0083333 \u2248 1.0250417\n^4 \u2248 1.0250417 *1.0083333 \u2248 1.033403\n^5 \u2248 1.033403 *1.0083333 \u2248 1.041832\n^6 \u2248 1.041832 *1.0083333 \u2248 1.050362\n^7 \u2248 1.050362 *1.0083333 \u2248 1.059006\n^8 \u2248 1.059006 *1.0083333 \u2248 1.067787\n^9 \u2248 1.067787 *1.0083333 \u2248 1.076726\n^10\u22481.076726 *1.0083333\u22481.085827\n^11\u22481.085827 *1.0083333\u22481.095098\n^12\u22481.095098 *1.0083333\u22481.104389\n\nSo (1.0083333)^12 \u2248 1.104389.\n\nSo (1.0083333)^-12 = 1/1.104389 \u2248 0.9054.\n\nSo 1 - 0.9054 = 0.0946.\n\nDivide by 0.0083333: 0.0946 /0.0083333 \u2248 11.30.\n\nSo PV =31.50 * 11.30 = 31.5 *11 =346.5 + 31.5 *0.3=9.45 \u2192 total 355.95.\n\nHmm, but that's less than 360. So perhaps the actual rate is a bit lower than 10%, maybe around 9.5% as I tried before.\n\nWait, but with 10% giving a PV of about 355.95, which is lower than 360, I'm getting a bit stuck. Earlier, at 5%, the PV was 368.87, which is higher than 360. So the rate must be between 5% and 10%.\n\nWait, perhaps I should set up the equation and solve for r numerically.\n\nWe have 360 = 31.50 \u00d7 [ (1 - (1 + r)^-12 ) / r ]\n\nWe can rearrange this as 360 /31.50 = [ (1 - (1 + r)^-12 ) / r ]\n\n360 divided by 31.50 is 11.42857.\n\nSo,\n\n(1 - (1 + r)^-12 ) / r = 11.42857.\n\nWe can try r =0.005 (which is 5% annual rate, 0.416667% monthly).\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, r is the monthly rate. So let me correct.\n\nWait, the equation uses r as the monthly rate. So if the annual rate is 5%, the monthly rate is 5/12% \u2248 0.0041667.\n\nSo let's plug r=0.0041667 into the equation.\n\n(1 - (1.0041667)^-12 ) / 0.0041667 \u2248 (1 - 0.95117) / 0.0041667 \u2248 0.04883 / 0.0041667 \u2248 11.71.\n\nWhich is higher than 11.42857, which suggests that the required r is higher than 0.0041667 (5% annual rate), because as r increases, the denominator increases, and (1 + r)^-12 decreases, so the numerator increases. Wait, no, actually, let me think again.\n\nWait, as the monthly rate r increases, (1 + r)^-12 decreases, so 1 - (1 + r)^-12 increases. So the numerator increases, and the denominator also increases. So the overall effect depends on which increases more.\n\nIn any case, at r=0.0041667 (5% annual), the factor is 11.71, which is higher than 11.42857. So we need a higher r to get a lower factor. Wait, no. Because if the factor is 11.71, which is higher than 11.42857, that would mean that for a higher r, the factor could be lower. So perhaps I need to find a higher r to get a lower factor.\n\nWait, let's try r=0.005 (which is 0.5% monthly, 6% annual rate).\n\nCompute (1.005)^12.\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\n1.005^1 =1.005\n^2=1.010025\n^3=1.015075\n^4=1.020150\n^5=1.02525\n^6=1.030378\n^7=1.035516\n^8=1.040708\n^9=1.045936\n^10=1.051209\n^11=1.056537\n^12=1.061894.\n\nSo (1.005)^12\u22481.061894. So (1.005)^-12 \u2248 1/1.061894\u22480.9417.\n\nSo 1 - 0.9417 = 0.0583.\n\nDivide by 0.005: 0.0583 /0.005=11.66.\n\nWhich is still higher than 11.42857. So the factor is 11.66 at r=0.005, which is higher than our target of 11.42857.\n\nSo we need a higher r to bring the factor down.\n\nLet me try r=0.006 (6% annual rate).\n\n(1.006)^12.\n\n1.006^12: Let's compute.\n\n1.006^1=1.006\n^2=1.012036\n^3=1.018117\n^4=1.024204\n^5=1.030324\n^6=1.036483\n^7=1.042680\n^8=1.048924\n^9=1.055220\n^10=1.061563\n^11=1.068007\n^12=1.074551.\n\nSo (1.006)^12\u22481.074551. Thus, (1.006)^-12\u22481/1.074551\u22480.9307.\n\nSo 1 - 0.9307=0.0693.\n\nDivide by 0.006: 0.0693 /0.006=11.55.\n\nStill higher than 11.42857.\n\nHmm, so at r=0.006, factor is 11.55.\n\nWe need factor=11.42857.\n\nSo let's try r=0.0065 (7.8% annual rate).\n\nCompute (1.0065)^12.\n\nApproximating:\n\nWe can use logarithms.\n\nln(1.0065)=approx 0.00648.\n\nMultiply by 12: 0.07776.\n\ne^0.07776\u22481.0808.\n\nSo (1.0065)^12\u22481.0808, so (1.0065)^-12\u22480.9253.\n\n1 - 0.9253=0.0747.\n\nDivide by 0.0065: 0.0747/0.0065\u224811.49.\n\nHmm, that's very close to 11.42857.\n\nWait, our target is 11.42857, and at r=0.0065, the factor is 11.49. That's close. So perhaps the exact r is around 0.0066 or so.\n\nBut perhaps for the purposes of this problem, the closest option is 10% annual rate, which gives a factor of approximately 11.30, which is lower than 11.42857.\n\nWait, but wait, 11.42857 is the target. So 11.49 is higher, so the required r would be a bit higher than 0.0065.\n\nBut perhaps the intended approach is the simple interest, giving 5% (option D), which is the total interest over the year.\n\nSo I'm a bit torn here. But given the options, and considering that the present value approach would give a rate around 7.8% (which isn't one of the options), but the simple interest approach gives 5%, which is an option, perhaps the intended answer is D)5%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the present value calculation earlier, and the correct approach is to use simple interest.\n\nWait, another way to look at it: the total amount paid is 378, so the interest is 18, which is 5% of 360. So perhaps the question expects the simple interest approach, making the answer D)5%.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Another thought: perhaps the installments are structured such that each installment's interest is calculated on the remaining principal. But that would make it more complex than simple interest.\n\nHmm. Considering the options and the time I've spent, I think the intended answer is D)5%, using the simple interest method.\n\n\nTo determine the interest rate, we analyze the problem using two approaches: the simple interest method and the present value of annuities method.\n\n### Key Information:\n- Borrowed amount (Principal, \\( P \\)) = Rs. 360  \n- Number of monthly installments (\\( n \\)) = 12  \n- Monthly installment amount (\\( PMT \\)) = Rs. 31.50  \n- Total amount paid back = \\( 12 \\times 31.50 = 378 \\)  \n- Total interest paid = \\( 378 - 360 = 18 \\).\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Simple Interest Approach**:\nThe total interest paid is Rs. 18 over the principal of Rs. 360. The annual interest rate (\\( r \\)) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{\\text{Total Interest}}{\\text{Principal}} \\times 100 = \\frac{18}{360} \\times 100 = 5\\%.\n\\]\n\nThis suggests an annual interest rate of **5%**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Present Value of Annuities Approach**:\nFor installment loans, the interest rate can also be calculated using the present value of an ordinary annuity formula:\n\n\\[\nPV = PMT \\times \\left[ \\frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r} \\right],\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( PV = 360 \\) (present value),\n- \\( PMT = 31.50 \\) (monthly payment),\n- \\( n = 12 \\) (number of periods),\n- \\( r \\) = monthly interest rate.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for \\( r \\) is complex algebraically, so we test the given options for \\( r \\) (annual rates) and calculate the present value factor:\n\n#### Testing Option D (5% Annual Rate):\n- Monthly rate: \\( r = \\frac{5}{12} \\approx 0.0041667 \\),\n- \\( (1 + r)^{-12} \\approx 0.95117 \\),\n- \\( 1 - (1 + r)^{-12} \\approx 0.04883 \\),\n- \\( \\frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-12}}{r} \\approx \\frac{0.04883}{0.0041667} \\approx 11.71 \\),\n- \\( PV = 31.50 \\times 11.71 \\approx 368.87 \\).\n\nThe calculated \\( PV \\) (368.87) is higher than the loan amount (360), indicating the rate is slightly lower than 5%.\n\n#### Testing Option C (10% Annual Rate):\n- Monthly rate: \\( r = \\frac{10}{12} \\approx 0.0083333 \\),\n- \\( (1 + r)^{-12} \\approx 0.905 \\),\n- \\( 1 - (1 + r)^{-12} \\approx 0.095 \\),\n- \\( \\frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-12}}{r} \\approx \\frac{0.095}{0.0083333} \\approx 11.4 \\),\n- \\( PV = 31.50 \\times 11.4 \\approx 358.1 \\).\n\nThe calculated \\( PV \\) (358.1) is lower than the loan amount (360), indicating the rate is slightly higher than 10%.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe present value approach suggests the interest rate is between 5% and 10%. However, the simple interest method directly gives a rate of **5%**, which aligns with the total interest paid (Rs. 18) being 5% of the principal (Rs. 360). Given the options and the problem's context, the intended answer is likely **5%**, as it simplifies the calculation and matches the total interest paid.\n\n**Answer: D**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where a man borrows Rs.360 and pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50 each. I need to find the interest rate. Hmm, I remember that when you pay back a loan in installments, it's not just simple interest. Probably, it's something like an annuity or installment loan calculation.\n\nWait, let me think. The total amount he's paying back is 12 times 31.50. Let me calculate that: 12 * 31.50 = 378. So he's paying back a total of Rs.378. The principal was 360, so the total interest is 378 - 360 = 18. So he's paying Rs.18 as interest over the year.\n\nBut wait, interest rates are usually calculated based on the principal. So if it's simple interest, the formula is I = P * R * T. Here, I is 18, P is 360, T is 1 year. So plugging in: 18 = 360 * R * 1. Solving for R: R = 18 / 360 = 0.05, which is 5%. That would make the answer D)5%. But wait, wait a second. Is it that straightforward?\n\nBecause in reality, when you pay installments, each payment covers part of the principal and part of the interest. So maybe it's not simple interest. Maybe it's compound interest or something else. Oh right, for installment loans, the effective interest rate is calculated differently. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the interest is calculated on the reducing balance each month. So each month, he pays Rs.31.50, part of which goes to the principal and part to the interest. Let me try that approach.\n\nWait, another approach is to think of it as an annuity due or ordinary annuity. The formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is P = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n)/r], where P is the principal, PMT is the monthly payment, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of periods.\n\nSo in this case, P is 360, PMT is 31.50, n is 12. Let's plug those into the formula:\n\n360 = 31.50 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-12 ) / r ]\n\nHmm, this equation looks a bit complex because it's not linear in r. I might need to solve for r numerically, but since this is a multiple-choice question, maybe I can approximate or test the options.\n\nWait, the options are 1.5%, 4.5%, 10%, 5%, 12%. So the interest rate is likely one of these annual rates. But wait, in the annuity formula, r is the monthly rate. So if the annual rate is, say, 5%, the monthly rate would be 5% /12 = ~0.0041667.\n\nLet me test this. Let's compute the right-hand side with r=0.0041667.\n\nCompute (1 - (1 + 0.0041667)^-12 ) / 0.0041667.\n\nFirst, 1 + 0.0041667 = 1.0041667. Raising that to the -12th power: let's compute 1.0041667^12. Hmm, I know that (1 + x)^n \u2248 e^(n x) when x is small. So x = 0.0041667, n=12. So 12 * 0.0041667 \u2248 0.05. e^0.05 \u2248 1.05127. So 1/(e^0.05) \u2248 0.95123. So 1 - 0.95123 = 0.04877.\n\nDivide by 0.0041667: 0.04877 / 0.0041667 \u2248 11.7.\n\nThen, PMT * factor is 31.50 * 11.7 \u2248 368.55. But our P is 360, so this is a bit higher. So the calculated present value would be higher than 360, which suggests that the interest rate is a bit higher than 5% because when r is higher, the present value would be lower.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Let's see, if the present value is lower when the interest rate is higher. Because higher r makes the denominator in the formula larger, making the entire fraction smaller. So if the present value calculated is higher than the actual P (360), that would mean that the r we're testing is lower than the actual rate. Because with a lower r, the present value would be higher.\n\nWait, in our test, we assumed r=5% annual, which is 0.0041667 per month. The present value calculation gave us about 368.55, which is higher than 360. So the actual rate must be higher than 5% because a higher rate would bring down the present value.\n\nWait, but 5% gave a present value higher than 360. So to get a lower present value, the rate should be higher. So perhaps the correct rate is higher than 5%? Let's try 6%. So the monthly rate would be 0.005.\n\nCompute (1 - (1.005)^-12 ) / 0.005.\n\n(1.005)^12 is approximately 1.0616778. So 1/(1.0616778) \u2248 0.94193. So 1 - 0.94193 = 0.05807.\n\nDivide by 0.005: 0.05807 / 0.005 = 11.614.\n\nMultiply by PMT=31.50: 31.50 * 11.614 \u2248 366.12. Still higher than 360. So the present value is still higher than 360. So r needs to be higher.\n\nLet's try 7% annual. So monthly rate is 7/12% \u2248 0.0058333.\n\nCompute (1 - (1.0058333)^-12 ) / 0.0058333.\n\n1.0058333^12 is approximately let's compute: (1.0058333)^12. Let me think, 0.0058333 * 12 = 0.07. So e^0.07 is about 1.0725. So 1/(1.0725) \u2248 0.9326. So 1 - 0.9326 = 0.0674.\n\nDivide by 0.0058333: 0.0674 / 0.0058333 \u2248 11.55.\n\n31.50 * 11.55 \u2248 364.725. Still higher than 360. So r needs to be even higher.\n\nWait, perhaps the rate is 10%? Let me check that.\n\n10% annual is 0.0083333 per month.\n\nCompute (1 - (1.0083333)^-12 ) / 0.0083333.\n\n1.0083333^12: Let me compute, 1.0083333^12. 0.0083333 *12 = 0.1, so e^0.1 \u2248 1.10517. So 1/1.10517 \u2248 0.90483. 1 - 0.90483 = 0.09517.\n\nDivide by 0.0083333: 0.09517 / 0.0083333 \u2248 11.22.\n\n31.50 * 11.22 \u2248 353.73. Oh, that's lower than 360. So with a 10% annual rate, the present value is 353.73, which is less than 360. So the correct rate must be between 7% and 10%.\n\nWait, but this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should try to compute this differently. Alternatively, perhaps the interest rate is simple interest, which would give 5%, which is one of the options. But earlier I thought it's not that simple because the installments reduce the principal each month.\n\nWait, another approach: if he's paying 31.50 per month for 12 months, the total amount he pays is 378, as calculated earlier. The principal is 360, so the interest is 18. Now, simple interest is calculated as (P * R * T)/100.\n\nSo here, I = 18, P=360, T=1. So 18 = (360 * R * 1)/100 \u2192 R = (18 *100)/(360*1) = 5%. So that would be 5%, which is option D. But wait, that's simple interest. But in reality, when paying installments, it's usually reducing the principal each month, so the interest component is less each month.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify whether it's simple or compound interest. Hmm. Maybe the question is intended to be solved using simple interest, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated on the initial amount, and the installments are structured so that each installment is the same, but that would make it an annuity.\n\nWait, another thought: the total interest is 18 over a year, so 18 is the interest for 360. So the rate is 18/360 *100 =5%. So it's 5% simple interest. But is that the correct approach?\n\nWait, but in reality, when you pay installments, you don't pay simple interest on the initial amount because each payment reduces the principal. So the interest each month is calculated on the remaining principal. Thus, the total interest would be less than 5% using simple interest calculation.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the total interest is 18, which is 5% of 360. So perhaps the question is considering simple interest. So the answer would be 5%, which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting the simple interest calculation, even though it's an installment loan. So perhaps the answer is 5%.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the interest rate, we analyze the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Total Repayment and Interest**:  \n   The man borrows Rs. 360 and repays it in 12 monthly installments of Rs. 31.50 each.

The formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is P = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n)/r], where P is the principal, PMT is the monthly payment, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of periods.\n\nSo in this case, P is 360, PMT is 31.50, n is 12. Let's plug those into the formula:\n\n360 = 31.50 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-12 ) / r ]\n\nHmm, this equation looks a bit complex because it's not linear in r. I might need to solve for r numerically, but since this is a multiple-choice question, maybe I can approximate or test the options.\n\nWait, the options are 1.5%, 4.5%, 10%, 5%, 12%. So the interest rate is likely one of these annual rates. But wait, in the annuity formula, r is the monthly rate. So if the annual rate is, say, 5%, the monthly rate would be 5% /12 = ~0.0041667.\n\nLet me test this. Let's compute the right-hand side with r=0.0041667.\n\nCompute (1 - (1 + 0.0041667)^-12 ) / 0.0041667.\n\nFirst, 1 + 0.0041667 = 1.0041667. Raising that to the -12th power: let's compute 1.0041667^12. Hmm, I know that (1 + x)^n \u2248 e^(n x) when x is small. So x = 0.0041667, n=12. So 12 * 0.0041667 \u2248 0.05. e^0.05 \u2248 1.05127. So 1/(e^0.05) \u2248 0.95123. So 1 - 0.95123 = 0.04877.\n\nDivide by 0.0041667: 0.04877 / 0.0041667 \u2248 11.7.\n\nThen, PMT * factor is 31.50 * 11.7 \u2248 368.55. But our P is 360, so this is a bit higher. So the calculated present value would be higher than 360, which suggests that the interest rate is a bit higher than 5% because when r is higher, the present value would be lower.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Let's see, if the present value is lower when the interest rate is higher. Because higher r makes the denominator in the formula larger, making the entire fraction smaller. So if the present value calculated is higher than the actual P (360), that would mean that the r we're testing is lower than the actual rate. Because with a lower r, the present value would be higher.\n\nWait, in our test, we assumed r=5% annual, which is 0.0041667 per month. The present value calculation gave us about 368.55, which is higher than 360. So the actual rate must be higher than 5% because a higher rate would bring down the present value.\n\nWait, but 5% gave a present value higher than 360. So to get a lower present value, the rate should be higher. So perhaps the correct rate is higher than 5%? Let's try 6%. So the monthly rate would be 0.005.\n\nCompute (1 - (1.005)^-12 ) / 0.005.\n\n(1.005)^12 is approximately 1.0616778. So 1/(1.0616778) \u2248 0.94193. So 1 - 0.94193 = 0.05807.\n\nDivide by 0.005: 0.05807 / 0.005 = 11.614.\n\nMultiply by PMT=31.50: 31.50 * 11.614 \u2248 366.12. Still higher than 360. So the present value is still higher than 360. So r needs to be higher.\n\nLet's try 7% annual. So monthly rate is 7/12% \u2248 0.0058333.\n\nCompute (1 - (1.0058333)^-12 ) / 0.0058333.\n\n1.0058333^12 is approximately let's compute: (1.0058333)^12. Let me think, 0.0058333 * 12 = 0.07. So e^0.07 is about 1.0725. So 1/(1.0725) \u2248 0.9326. So 1 - 0.9326 = 0.0674.\n\nDivide by 0.0058333: 0.0674 / 0.0058333 \u2248 11.55.\n\n31.50 * 11.55 \u2248 364.725. Still higher than 360. So r needs to be even higher.\n\nWait, perhaps the rate is 10%? Let me check that.\n\n10% annual is 0.0083333 per month.\n\nCompute (1 - (1.0083333)^-12 ) / 0.0083333.\n\n1.0083333^12: Let me compute, 1.0083333^12. 0.0083333 *12 = 0.1, so e^0.1 \u2248 1.10517. So 1/1.10517 \u2248 0.90483. 1 - 0.90483 = 0.09517.\n\nDivide by 0.0083333: 0.09517 / 0.0083333 \u2248 11.22.\n\n31.50 * 11.22 \u2248 353.73. Oh, that's lower than 360. So with a 10% annual rate, the present value is 353.73, which is less than 360. So the correct rate must be between 7% and 10%.\n\nWait, but this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should try to compute this differently. Alternatively, perhaps the interest rate is simple interest, which would give 5%, which is one of the options. But earlier I thought it's not that simple because the installments reduce the principal each month.\n\nWait, another approach: if he's paying 31.50 per month for 12 months, the total amount he pays is 378, as calculated earlier. The principal is 360, so the interest is 18. Now, simple interest is calculated as (P * R * T)/100.\n\nSo here, I = 18, P=360, T=1. So 18 = (360 * R * 1)/100 \u2192 R = (18 *100)/(360*1) = 5%. So that would be 5%, which is option D. But wait, that's simple interest. But in reality, when paying installments, it's usually reducing the principal each month, so the interest component is less each month.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify whether it's simple or compound interest. Hmm. Maybe the question is intended to be solved using simple interest, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated on the initial amount, and the installments are structured so that each installment is the same, but that would make it an annuity.\n\nWait, another thought: the total interest is 18 over a year, so 18 is the interest for 360. So the rate is 18/360 *100 =5%. So it's 5% simple interest. But is that the correct approach?\n\nWait, but in reality, when you pay installments, you don't pay simple interest on the initial amount because each payment reduces the principal. So the interest each month is calculated on the remaining principal. Thus, the total interest would be less than 5% using simple interest calculation.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the total interest is 18, which is 5% of 360. So perhaps the question is considering simple interest. So the answer would be 5%, which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting the simple interest calculation, even though it's an installment loan. So perhaps the answer is 5%.\n\n\nTo determine the interest rate, we analyze the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Total Repayment and Interest**:  \n   The man borrows Rs. 360 and repays it in 12 monthly installments of Rs. 31.50 each. The total repayment amount is:  \n   \\[\n   12 \\times 31.50 = 378 \\, \\text{Rs}.\n   \\]  \n   The total interest paid is the difference between the total repayment and the principal:  \n   \\[\n   378 - 360 = 18 \\, \\text{Rs}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Simple Interest Calculation**:  \n   Simple interest is calculated using the formula:  \n   \\[\n   I = P \\times R \\times T,\n   \\]  \n   where \\(I\\) is the interest, \\(P\\) is the principal, \\(R\\) is the annual interest rate, and \\(T\\) is the time in years. Here, \\(I = 18\\), \\(P = 360\\), and \\(T = 1\\). Substituting these values:  \n   \\[\n   18 = 360 \\times R \\times 1.\n   \\]  \n   Solving for \\(R\\):  \n   \\[\n   R = \\frac{18}{360} = 0.05 = 5\\%.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Installment Loan Consideration**:  \n   For installment loans, interest is typically calculated on the reducing balance. However, the problem does not explicitly state whether compound or simple interest is used. Given the total interest of Rs. 18 and the principal of Rs. 360, the calculation aligns with simple interest, yielding an annual interest rate of 5%.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:  \n   Based on the given data and the assumption of simple interest, the annual interest rate is 5%.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where a man borrows Rs.360 and pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50 each. I need to find out what the interest rate is. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nWait, I remember something about installments and interest rates. I think this has to do with simple interest or maybe compound interest. But wait, the installments are paid monthly, so maybe it's simple interest over the period.\n\nLet me think. The total amount he's paying back is 12 times 31.50. Let me calculate that. 12 * 31.50 is... 378. So he's paying back 378 in total, which means the interest is 378 - 360 = 18. So the total interest is Rs.18 over the year.\n\nWait, but is this simple interest? Because in simple interest, the interest is calculated each period on the principal. But in this case, he's paying installments, so maybe it's not the same as just simple interest over the year.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about this differently. If he's paying each month, perhaps the interest is calculated on the reducing balance. Or maybe it's an annuity calculation. Annuity is when you have equal payments made at regular intervals. So this is an annuity problem.\n\nAnnuity formulas can be a bit tricky. The present value of an ordinary annuity is given by PV = PMT * [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r, where PMT is the monthly payment, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of periods.\n\nIn this case, PV is 360, PMT is 31.50, and n is 12. So I can set up the equation:\n\n360 = 31.50 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-12 ) / r ]\n\nHmm, I need to solve for r here. But this equation isn't straightforward algebraically because r is in the denominator and also in the exponent. Maybe I can try plugging in the options to see which one fits.\n\nThe options are A)1.5%, B)4.5%, C)10%, D)5%, E)12%. Wait, these are annual rates, I think. So I'll need to convert them to monthly rates.\n\nLet me try option D, 5%. So the monthly rate would be 5% / 12 \u2248 0.4167% per month.\n\nLet me plug that into the equation. Let's compute the factor [1 - (1 + 0.004167)^-12 ] / 0.004167.\n\nFirst, compute (1.004167)^12. Let me approximate that. Using the formula (1 + r)^n \u2248 1 + nr + (n(n-1)/2) r\u00b2 for small r, but maybe just calculating step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute (1.004167)^12. Let me calculate it step by step. 1.004167^1 is about 1.004167.\n\n1.004167^2 \u2248 1.00835.\n\n1.004167^3 \u2248 1.01254.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to compute 1.004167^12. Let me think, perhaps using logarithms or another approximation. Alternatively, I remember that (1 + 0.004167)^12 is approximately e^(0.05) since 0.004167 *12 \u2248 0.05. But wait, e^0.05 is about 1.05127. So 1.05127.\n\nSo 1/(1.05127) \u2248 0.95123.\n\nSo 1 - 0.95123 = 0.04877.\n\nNow, divide that by 0.004167: 0.04877 / 0.004167 \u2248 11.7.\n\nSo the factor is approximately 11.7.\n\nNow, PMT is 31.50. So 31.50 * 11.7 = 368.55. But the PV is 360, which is less than 368.55. So this suggests that with a 5% rate, the present value is higher than 360, which is not what we want. Because we have PV=360, so if the rate is higher, the present value would be lower.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated. Alternatively, maybe I should try a higher interest rate to get a lower present value.\n\nWait, let me try option B: 4.5% annual rate. So the monthly rate is 4.5/12 = 0.375% per month.\n\nCompute the factor: [1 - (1 + 0.00375)^-12 ] / 0.00375.\n\nCalculate (1.00375)^12. Again, maybe approximate.\n\n(1.00375)^12: Let's compute it step by step. Let's compute ln(1.00375) \u2248 0.003744. Multiply by 12: 0.04493. Then exponentiate: e^0.04493 \u2248 1.0461.\n\nSo 1/(1.0461) \u2248 0.9559.\n\n1 - 0.9559 = 0.0441.\n\nDivide by 0.00375: 0.0441 / 0.00375 \u2248 11.76.\n\nSo the factor is approximately 11.76.\n\nSo 31.50 * 11.76 = let's compute 31.5 * 11.76.\n\n31.5 *10=315, 31.5 *1.76= approx 31.5 *1.7=53.55, 31.5 *0.06=1.89 \u2192 total 53.55 +1.89=55.44. So 315 +55.44=370.44. So PV would be 370.44, which is higher than 360. So the present value is higher, which suggests that the interest rate is higher than 4.5%, because a higher rate would lower the PV.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Because if the rate is higher, the present value of the installments would be lower. Because each payment is worth less in present value when the discount rate is higher.\n\nSo if at 4.5%, the present value is higher than 360, but we need the present value to be 360, that suggests that the rate is higher than 4.5%, because a higher rate would make the present value lower.\n\nWait, but when I tried 5%, the PV came out higher than 360, which isn't correct. Wait, wait, perhaps I did the calculation wrong.\n\nWait, let me recheck the 5% calculation. Monthly rate is 5/12% which is approx 0.416667% per month.\n\nSo 1.004167^12: Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nCompute each step:\n\n1.004167^1 = 1.004167\n\n^2: 1.004167 *1.004167 \u2248 1.00835.\n\n^3: 1.00835 *1.004167 \u2248 1.01254.\n\n^4: 1.01254 *1.004167 \u2248 1.0167.\n\n^5: 1.0167 *1.004167 \u2248 1.0209.\n\n^6: 1.0209 *1.004167 \u2248 1.0252.\n\n^7: 1.0252 *1.004167 \u2248 1.0295.\n\n^8: 1.0295 *1.004167 \u2248 1.0338.\n\n^9: 1.0338 *1.004167 \u2248 1.0382.\n\n^10: 1.0382 *1.004167 \u2248 1.0426.\n\n^11: 1.0426 *1.004167 \u2248 1.0471.\n\n^12: 1.0471 *1.004167 \u2248 1.0517.\n\nSo (1.004167)^12 \u2248 1.0517.\n\nSo 1/(1.0517) \u2248 0.951.\n\n1 - 0.951 = 0.049.\n\nDivide by 0.004167: 0.049 /0.004167 \u2248 11.76.\n\nSo the factor is 11.76.\n\nSo 31.5 *11.76 = ?\n\n31.5 *10=315, 31.5 *1.76=55.44 \u2192 total 370.44.\n\nSo with 5% rate, the present value is 370.44, which is higher than 360. So the actual rate should be higher than 5%, because a higher rate would lower the present value.\n\nWait, but looking back, the options don't have anything higher than 5% except E)12%. That can't be right because 12% would be way too high.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe it's simple interest. Because if the installments are being paid every month, perhaps it's simple interest on the principal for each month.\n\nWait, simple interest is calculated as principal * rate * time. But with installments, each payment reduces the principal.\n\nWait, let's think. Maybe the interest is calculated each month on the remaining principal. So perhaps the first installment is principal plus interest for one month, the second is on the new principal, etc.\n\nWait, that's a bit complicated. Let me try to model it.\n\nHe borrows 360. He pays back 31.50 each month for 12 months.\n\nEach month, he pays some amount towards principal and some towards interest.\n\nWait, but the interest rate is the same each month, right? So it's like a reducing balance loan.\n\nLet me model each payment.\n\nLet r be the monthly interest rate.\n\nThe first payment is 31.50. Let's say x is the principal part and y is the interest part. So x + y = 31.50.\n\nThe interest for the first month is 360 * r. So y = 360 * r.\n\nSo x = 31.50 - 360 r.\n\nAfter first payment, the principal becomes 360 - x = 360 - (31.50 - 360 r) = 360 -31.50 + 360 r = 328.50 + 360 r.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Maybe I should think of it as the remaining principal after each payment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each payment is applied first to the interest, then to the principal.\n\nSo for each month, the interest is calculated on the current principal, then subtracted, and the rest goes to principal.\n\nSo:\n\nLet P0 = 360.\n\nAfter first month:\n\nInterest = P0 * r.\n\nPayment is 31.50, so principal paid is 31.50 - interest.\n\nSo P1 = P0 - (31.50 - P0 r).\n\nSimilarly, for each subsequent month.\n\nThis seems like a better approach.\n\nSo let's compute each month step by step.\n\nLet me try to model this with r as the monthly interest rate.\n\nP0 = 360.\n\nInterest for month 1: 360 * r.\n\nPrincipal paid in month 1: 31.50 - 360 r.\n\nP1 = 360 - (31.50 - 360 r) = 360 -31.50 +360 r = 328.50 + 360 r.\n\nWait, that's a bit messy, but perhaps I can write a general formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula for the remaining principal after n payments is:\n\nPn = P0 * (1 + r)^n - PMT * [( (1 + r)^n -1 ) / r ]\n\nWait, I think that's the formula for the outstanding balance on a loan with monthly payments.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to just try plugging in the options to see which one makes P12 = 0.\n\nBecause after 12 payments, the principal should be zero.\n\nSo let's try option D, 5% annual rate. So monthly rate r = 5% /12 \u2248 0.0041667.\n\nSo let's compute P12 using the formula:\n\nP12 = 360*(1 + r)^12 - 31.50 * [ ( (1 + r)^12 - 1 ) / r ]\n\nIf P12 is zero, then that's our correct r.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should compute this. Let me compute each part.\n\n(1 + r)^12 = (1 + 0.0041667)^12 \u2248 1.0511619.\n\nSo 360 * 1.0511619 \u2248 360 * 1.0511619 \u2248 378.418.\n\nNow, compute the second term: 31.50 * [ (1.0511619 - 1 ) / 0.0041667 ]\n\n(1.0511619 -1) = 0.0511619.\n\nDivide by 0.0041667: 0.0511619 / 0.0041667 \u2248 12.288.\n\nSo 31.50 * 12.288 \u2248 386.928.\n\nSo P12 = 378.418 - 386.928 = -8.51.\n\nWait, that's negative. So that means after 12 payments, the principal is still not zero. Hmm, but that can't be. Maybe I messed up the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is Pn = P0*(1 + r)^n - PMT * [ ( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) / r ]\n\nSo if P12 is zero, then 360*(1+r)^12 = 31.50 * [ ( (1 + r)^12 -1 ) / r ]\n\nSo let me compute both sides for r=0.0041667.\n\nLeft side: 360 * 1.0511619 \u2248 378.418.\n\nRight side: 31.50 * [ (0.0511619) / 0.0041667 ] = 31.50 * 12.288 \u2248 386.928.\n\nSo 378.418 \u2260 386.928, so P12 is negative. That means that the loan is paid off before 12 months, which isn't the case here.\n\nWait, but the installments are for 12 months, so perhaps the rate is lower than 5%.\n\nWait, but when I tried r=5% per annum, the present value was 370.44, which is higher than 360, so that suggests that a higher rate would be needed.\n\nWait, maybe I should try a higher rate. Let's try option B, 4.5% annual rate.\n\nSo r = 4.5/12 = 0.00375.\n\nCompute (1 + 0.00375)^12. Let's compute this accurately.\n\n(1.00375)^12. Let me compute step by step:\n\n1.00375^1 = 1.00375\n\n^2: 1.00375 * 1.00375 = 1.007515625.\n\n^3: 1.007515625 * 1.00375 \u2248 1.01128418.\n\n^4: 1.01128418 * 1.00375 \u2248 1.015078.\n\n^5: 1.015078 * 1.00375 \u2248 1.018902.\n\n^6: 1.018902 * 1.00375 \u2248 1.022757.\n\n^7: 1.022757 * 1.00375 \u2248 1.026654.\n\n^8: 1.026654 * 1.00375 \u2248 1.030583.\n\n^9: 1.030583 * 1.00375 \u2248 1.034555.\n\n^10: 1.034555 * 1.00375 \u2248 1.038570.\n\n^11: 1.038570 * 1.00375 \u2248 1.042630.\n\n^12: 1.042630 * 1.00375 \u2248 1.046748.\n\nSo (1.00375)^12 \u2248 1.046748.\n\nNow, compute the present value factor:\n\n[1 - (1.00375)^-12 ] / 0.00375.\n\nFirst, compute (1.00375)^12 \u22481.046748. So (1.00375)^-12 \u2248 1/1.046748 \u2248 0.9558.\n\nSo 1 - 0.9558 = 0.0442.\n\nDivide by 0.00375: 0.0442 / 0.00375 \u2248 11.7867.\n\nSo PV = 31.50 * 11.7867 \u2248 31.5 *11.7867 \u2248 371.49.\n\nBut the PV is 360, so 371.49 is higher than 360. So the present value is too high, meaning the rate is lower than 4.5%? Wait, no, because a higher rate would lower the present value. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this backwards.\n\nWait, when the rate increases, the present value factor decreases because each payment is discounted more heavily. So if at 4.5%, the present value is higher than 360, and we need the present value to be 360, the actual rate must be higher than 4.5% because a higher rate would reduce the present value.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried 5%, the present value was 370.44, which is still higher than 360. Hmm, that's confusing. Because 5% is higher than 4.5%, but the PV is even higher. That suggests I'm making a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of simple interest. The total interest paid is 378 -360 = 18. So total interest is 18 over 12 months, which is one year. So the simple interest rate would be (18/360)*100% = 5%. So that's option D.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried the annuity approach, the 5% didn't seem to fit. But perhaps the question is expecting the simple interest calculation.\n\nIn simple interest, the interest is calculated on the initial principal. So interest = P * r * t.\n\nHere, P=360, t=1 year, and interest is 18. So 18 = 360 * r * 1 \u2192 r=18/360 = 0.05 \u2192 5% per annum.\n\nSo the answer would be D)5%.\n\nBut wait, why did the annuity approach suggest that 5% leads to a higher present value than 360? Because in that case, the present value using 5% is 370.44, which is higher than 360, which would suggest that the rate is higher than 5% to lower the present value to 360. But according to simple interest, it's 5%.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question is assuming simple interest rather than an annuity. Because in an annuity, the installments reduce the principal each month, so the interest is calculated on a reducing balance, which would be a bit more complex.\n\nWait, but the simple interest calculation gives 5%, which is one of the options. So perhaps the answer is D)5%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is intended to be a simple interest problem, and the installments are structured such that the total interest is 18, leading to 5% simple interest.\n\nSo putting it all together, the correct answer is D)5%.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where a man borrows Rs.360 and pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50 each. I need to find out what the interest rate is. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nWait, I remember something about installments and interest rates. I think this has to do with simple interest or maybe compound interest. But wait, the installments are paid monthly, so maybe it's simple interest over the period.\n\nLet me think. The total amount he's paying back is 12 times 31.50. Let me calculate that. 12 * 31.50 is... 378. So he's paying back 378 in total, which means the interest is 378 - 360 = 18. So the total interest is Rs.18 over the year.\n\nWait, but is this simple interest? Because in simple interest, the interest is calculated each period on the principal. But in this case, he's paying installments, so maybe it's not the same as just simple interest over the year.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about this differently. If he's paying each month, perhaps the interest is calculated on the reducing balance. Or maybe it's an annuity calculation. Annuity is when you have equal payments made at regular intervals. So this is an annuity problem.\n\nAnnuity formulas can be a bit tricky. The present value of an ordinary annuity is given by PV = PMT * [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r, where PMT is the monthly payment, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of periods.\n\nIn this case, PV is 360, PMT is 31.50, and n is 12. So I can set up the equation:\n\n360 = 31.50 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-12 ) / r ]\n\nHmm, I need to solve for r here. But this equation isn't straightforward algebraically because r is in the denominator and also in the exponent. Maybe I can try plugging in the options to see which one fits.\n\nThe options are A)1.5%, B)4.5%, C)10%, D)5%, E)12%. Wait, these are annual rates, I think. So I'll need to convert them to monthly rates.\n\nLet me try option D, 5%. So the monthly rate would be 5% / 12 \u2248 0.4167% per month.\n\nLet me plug that into the equation. Let's compute the factor [1 - (1 + 0.004167)^-12 ] / 0.004167.\n\nFirst, compute (1.004167)^12. Let me approximate that. Using the formula (1 + r)^n \u2248 1 + nr + (n(n-1)/2) r\u00b2 for small r, but maybe just calculating step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute (1.004167)^12. Let me calculate it step by step. 1.004167^1 is about 1.004167.\n\n1.004167^2 \u2248 1.00835.\n\n1.004167^3 \u2248 1.01254.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to compute 1.004167^12. Let me think, perhaps using logarithms or another approximation. Alternatively, I remember that (1 + 0.004167)^12 is approximately e^(0.05) since 0.004167 *12 \u2248 0.05. But wait, e^0.05 is about 1.05127. So 1.05127.\n\nSo 1/(1.05127) \u2248 0.95123.\n\nSo 1 - 0.95123 = 0.04877.\n\nNow, divide that by 0.004167: 0.04877 / 0.004167 \u2248 11.7.\n\nSo the factor is approximately 11.7.\n\nNow, PMT is 31.50. So 31.50 * 11.7 = 368.55. But the PV is 360, which is less than 368.55. So this suggests that with a 5% rate, the present value is higher than 360, which is not what we want. Because we have PV=360, so if the rate is higher, the present value would be lower.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated. Alternatively, maybe I should try a higher interest rate to get a lower present value.\n\nWait, let me try option B: 4.5% annual rate. So the monthly rate is 4.5/12 = 0.375% per month.\n\nCompute the factor: [1 - (1 + 0.00375)^-12 ] / 0.00375.\n\nCalculate (1.00375)^12. Again, maybe approximate.\n\n(1.00375)^12: Let's compute it step by step. Let's compute ln(1.00375) \u2248 0.003744. Multiply by 12: 0.04493. Then exponentiate: e^0.04493 \u2248 1.0461.\n\nSo 1/(1.0461) \u2248 0.9559.\n\n1 - 0.9559 = 0.0441.\n\nDivide by 0.00375: 0.0441 / 0.00375 \u2248 11.76.\n\nSo the factor is approximately 11.76.\n\nSo 31.50 * 11.76 = let's compute 31.5 * 11.76.\n\n31.5 *10=315, 31.5 *1.76= approx 31.5 *1.7=53.55, 31.5 *0.06=1.89 \u2192 total 53.55 +1.89=55.44. So 315 +55.44=370.44. So PV would be 370.44, which is higher than 360. So the present value is higher, which suggests that the interest rate is higher than 4.5%, because a higher rate would lower the PV.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Because if the rate is higher, the present value of the installments would be lower. Because each payment is worth less in present value when the discount rate is higher.\n\nSo if at 4.5%, the present value is higher than 360, but we need the present value to be 360, that suggests that the rate is higher than 4.5%, because a higher rate would make the present value lower.\n\nWait, but when I tried 5%, the PV came out higher than 360, which isn't correct. Wait, wait, perhaps I did the calculation wrong.\n\nWait, let me recheck the 5% calculation. Monthly rate is 5/12% which is approx 0.416667% per month.\n\nSo 1.004167^12: Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nCompute each step:\n\n1.004167^1 = 1.004167\n\n^2: 1.004167 *1.004167 \u2248 1.00835.\n\n^3: 1.00835 *1.004167 \u2248 1.01254.\n\n^4: 1.01254 *1.004167 \u2248 1.0167.\n\n^5: 1.0167 *1.004167 \u2248 1.0209.\n\n^6: 1.0209 *1.004167 \u2248 1.0252.\n\n^7: 1.0252 *1.004167 \u2248 1.0295.\n\n^8: 1.0295 *1.004167 \u2248 1.0338.\n\n^9: 1.0338 *1.004167 \u2248 1.0382.\n\n^10: 1.0382 *1.004167 \u2248 1.0426.\n\n^11: 1.0426 *1.004167 \u2248 1.0471.\n\n^12: 1.0471 *1.004167 \u2248 1.0517.\n\nSo (1.004167)^12 \u2248 1.0517.\n\nSo 1/(1.0517) \u2248 0.951.\n\n1 - 0.951 = 0.049.\n\nDivide by 0.004167: 0.049 /0.004167 \u2248 11.76.\n\nSo the factor is 11.76.\n\nSo 31.5 *11.76 = ?\n\n31.5 *10=315, 31.5 *1.76=55.44 \u2192 total 370.44.\n\nSo with 5% rate, the present value is 370.44, which is higher than 360. So the actual rate should be higher than 5%, because a higher rate would lower the present value.\n\nWait, but looking back, the options don't have anything higher than 5% except E)12%. That can't be right because 12% would be way too high.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe it's simple interest. Because if the installments are being paid every month, perhaps it's simple interest on the principal for each month.\n\nWait, simple interest is calculated as principal * rate * time. But with installments, each payment reduces the principal.\n\nWait, let's think. Maybe the interest is calculated each month on the remaining principal. So perhaps the first installment is principal plus interest for one month, the second is on the new principal, etc.\n\nWait, that's a bit complicated. Let me try to model it.\n\nHe borrows 360. He pays back 31.50 each month for 12 months.\n\nEach month, he pays some amount towards principal and some towards interest.\n\nWait, but the interest rate is the same each month, right? So it's like a reducing balance loan.\n\nLet me model each payment.\n\nLet r be the monthly interest rate.\n\nThe first payment is 31.50. Let's say x is the principal part and y is the interest part. So x + y = 31.50.\n\nThe interest for the first month is 360 * r. So y = 360 * r.\n\nSo x = 31.50 - 360 r.\n\nAfter first payment, the principal becomes 360 - x = 360 - (31.50 - 360 r) = 360 -31.50 + 360 r = 328.50 + 360 r.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Maybe I should think of it as the remaining principal after each payment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each payment is applied first to the interest, then to the principal.\n\nSo for each month, the interest is calculated on the current principal, then subtracted, and the rest goes to principal.\n\nSo:\n\nLet P0 = 360.\n\nAfter first month:\n\nInterest = P0 * r.\n\nPayment is 31.50, so principal paid is 31.50 - interest.\n\nSo P1 = P0 - (31.50 - P0 r).\n\nSimilarly, for each subsequent month.\n\nThis seems like a better approach.\n\nSo let's compute each month step by step.\n\nLet me try to model this with r as the monthly interest rate.\n\nP0 = 360.\n\nInterest for month 1: 360 * r.\n\nPrincipal paid in month 1: 31.50 - 360 r.\n\nP1 = 360 - (31.50 - 360 r) = 360 -31.50 +360 r = 328.50 + 360 r.\n\nWait, that's a bit messy, but perhaps I can write a general formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula for the remaining principal after n payments is:\n\nPn = P0 * (1 + r)^n - PMT * [( (1 + r)^n -1 ) / r ]\n\nWait, I think that's the formula for the outstanding balance on a loan with monthly payments.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to just try plugging in the options to see which one makes P12 = 0.\n\nBecause after 12 payments, the principal should be zero.\n\nSo let's try option D, 5% annual rate. So monthly rate r = 5% /12 \u2248 0.0041667.\n\nSo let's compute P12 using the formula:\n\nP12 = 360*(1 + r)^12 - 31.50 * [ ( (1 + r)^12 - 1 ) / r ]\n\nIf P12 is zero, then that's our correct r.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should compute this. Let me compute each part.\n\n(1 + r)^12 = (1 + 0.0041667)^12 \u2248 1.0511619.\n\nSo 360 * 1.0511619 \u2248 360 * 1.0511619 \u2248 378.418.\n\nNow, compute the second term: 31.50 * [ (1.0511619 - 1 ) / 0.0041667 ]\n\n(1.0511619 -1) = 0.0511619.\n\nDivide by 0.0041667: 0.0511619 / 0.0041667 \u2248 12.288.\n\nSo 31.50 * 12.288 \u2248 386.928.\n\nSo P12 = 378.418 - 386.928 = -8.51.\n\nWait, that's negative. So that means after 12 payments, the principal is still not zero. Hmm, but that can't be. Maybe I messed up the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is Pn = P0*(1 + r)^n - PMT * [ ( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) / r ]\n\nSo if P12 is zero, then 360*(1+r)^12 = 31.50 * [ ( (1 + r)^12 -1 ) / r ]\n\nSo let me compute both sides for r=0.0041667.\n\nLeft side: 360 * 1.0511619 \u2248 378.418.\n\nRight side: 31.50 * [ (0.0511619) / 0.0041667 ] = 31.50 * 12.288 \u2248 386.928.\n\nSo 378.418 \u2260 386.928, so P12 is negative. That means that the loan is paid off before 12 months, which isn't the case here.\n\nWait, but the installments are for 12 months, so perhaps the rate is lower than 5%.\n\nWait, but when I tried r=5% per annum, the present value was 370.44, which is higher than 360, so that suggests that a higher rate would be needed.\n\nWait, maybe I should try a higher rate. Let's try option B, 4.5% annual rate.\n\nSo r = 4.5/12 = 0.00375.\n\nCompute (1 + 0.00375)^12. Let's compute this accurately.\n\n(1.00375)^12. Let me compute step by step:\n\n1.00375^1 = 1.00375\n\n^2: 1.00375 * 1.00375 = 1.007515625.\n\n^3: 1.007515625 * 1.00375 \u2248 1.01128418.\n\n^4: 1.01128418 * 1.00375 \u2248 1.015078.\n\n^5: 1.015078 * 1.00375 \u2248 1.018902.\n\n^6: 1.018902 * 1.00375 \u2248 1.022757.\n\n^7: 1.022757 * 1.00375 \u2248 1.026654.\n\n^8: 1.026654 * 1.00375 \u2248 1.030583.\n\n^9: 1.030583 * 1.00375 \u2248 1.034555.\n\n^10: 1.034555 * 1.00375 \u2248 1.038570.\n\n^11: 1.038570 * 1.00375 \u2248 1.042630.\n\n^12: 1.042630 * 1.00375 \u2248 1.046748.\n\nSo (1.00375)^12 \u2248 1.046748.\n\nNow, compute the present value factor:\n\n[1 - (1.00375)^-12 ] / 0.00375.\n\nFirst, compute (1.00375)^12 \u22481.046748. So (1.00375)^-12 \u2248 1/1.046748 \u2248 0.9558.\n\nSo 1 - 0.9558 = 0.0442.\n\nDivide by 0.00375: 0.0442 / 0.00375 \u2248 11.7867.\n\nSo PV = 31.50 * 11.7867 \u2248 31.5 *11.7867 \u2248 371.49.\n\nBut the PV is 360, so 371.49 is higher than 360. So the present value is too high, meaning the rate is lower than 4.5%? Wait, no, because a higher rate would lower the present value. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this backwards.\n\nWait, when the rate increases, the present value factor decreases because each payment is discounted more heavily. So if at 4.5%, the present value is higher than 360, and we need the present value to be 360, the actual rate must be higher than 4.5% because a higher rate would reduce the present value.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried 5%, the present value was 370.44, which is still higher than 360. Hmm, that's confusing. Because 5% is higher than 4.5%, but the PV is even higher. That suggests I'm making a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of simple interest. The total interest paid is 378 -360 = 18. So total interest is 18 over 12 months, which is one year. So the simple interest rate would be (18/360)*100% = 5%. So that's option D.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried the annuity approach, the 5% didn't seem to fit. But perhaps the question is expecting the simple interest calculation.\n\nIn simple interest, the interest is calculated on the initial principal. So interest = P * r * t.\n\nHere, P=360, t=1 year, and interest is 18. So 18 = 360 * r * 1 \u2192 r=18/360 = 0.05 \u2192 5% per annum.\n\nSo the answer would be D)5%.\n\nBut wait, why did the annuity approach suggest that 5% leads to a higher present value than 360? Because in that case, the present value using 5% is 370.44, which is higher than 360, which would suggest that the rate is higher than 5% to lower the present value to 360. But according to simple interest, it's 5%.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question is assuming simple interest rather than an annuity. Because in an annuity, the installments reduce the principal each month, so the interest is calculated on a reducing balance, which would be a bit more complex.\n\nWait, but the simple interest calculation gives 5%, which is one of the options. So perhaps the answer is D)5%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is intended to be a simple interest problem, and the installments are structured such that the total interest is 18, leading to 5% simple interest.\n\nSo putting it all together, the correct answer is D)5%.\n\n\nTo determine the interest rate, we analyze the problem as follows:\n\nThe man borrows **Rs. 360** and repays it in **12 monthly installments of Rs. 31.50 each**. The total amount repaid over 12 months is:\n\n\\[\n12 \\times 31.50 = 378 \\, \\text{Rs}.\n\\]\n\nThe total interest paid is the difference between the total repayment and the principal amount:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Interest} = 378 - 360 = 18 \\, \\text{Rs}.\n\\]\n\n### Simple Interest Approach\nIn simple interest, the interest is calculated on the principal amount for the entire period. The formula for simple interest is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Interest} = P \\times r \\times t,\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( P = 360 \\, \\text{Rs} \\) (principal),\n- \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate (to be determined),\n- \\( t = 1 \\, \\text{year} \\).\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\n18 = 360 \\times r \\times 1 \\implies r = \\frac{18}{360} = 0.05 = 5\\%.\n\\]\n\nThus, the annual interest rate is **5%**.\n\n### Verification with Annuity Formula\nThe annuity formula for the present value of equal monthly payments is:\n\n\\[\nPV = PMT \\times \\frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r},\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( PV = 360 \\, \\text{Rs} \\),\n- \\( PMT = 31.50 \\, \\text{Rs} \\),\n- \\( n = 12 \\) (number of months),\n- \\( r \\) is the monthly interest rate.\n\nUsing \\( r = \\frac{5\\%}{12} \\approx 0.004167 \\), we compute:\n\n\\[\n(1 + r)^{12} \\approx (1 + 0.004167)^{12} \\approx 1.05116,\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-12}}{r} \\approx \\frac{1 - 1.05116^{-1}}{0.004167} \\approx 11.76.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting into the formula:\n\n\\[\nPV = 31.50 \\times 11.76 \\approx 370.44 \\, \\text{Rs}.\n\\]\n\nThis result is slightly higher than the principal (\\( 360 \\, \\text{Rs} \\)), indicating that the actual interest rate is slightly higher than \\( 5\\% \\). However, since \\( 5\\% \\) is one of the options and aligns with the simple interest calculation, it is reasonable to conclude that the intended answer is **5%**.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe interest rate is **5% per annum**.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where a man borrows Rs. 360 and pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50 each. The question is asking what his interest rate is. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on interest calculations, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nFirst, I remember that when someone takes a loan and pays it back in installments, it's usually an example of simple interest or maybe something else like reducing balance. But I'm not sure. Let's see.\n\nSo the man borrows 360 Rs. and pays back 31.50 each month for 12 months. Let me calculate the total amount he's paying back. 31.50 multiplied by 12. Let me do that: 31.5 * 12. Hmm, 30*12 is 360, and 1.5*12 is 18, so total is 378 Rs. So he's paying back 378 Rs. in total.\n\nWait, so he borrowed 360 and paid back 378. That means the total interest is 378 minus 360, which is 18 Rs. So the interest over the year is 18 Rs.\n\nNow, to find the interest rate, I think we use the simple interest formula. Simple interest is calculated as I = P * R * T, where I is interest, P principal, R rate, T time. We need to find R.\n\nWe have I as 18 Rs., P as 360, T as 1 year (since it's 12 monthly installments). So plugging into the formula:\n\n18 = 360 * R * 1\n\nSo R would be 18 / 360 = 0.05.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where a man borrows Rs. 360 and pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50 each. The question is asking what his interest rate is. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on interest calculations, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nFirst, I remember that when someone takes a loan and pays it back in installments, it's usually an example of simple interest or maybe something else like reducing balance. But I'm not sure. Let's see.\n\nSo the man borrows 360 Rs. and pays back 31.50 each month for 12 months. Let me calculate the total amount he's paying back. 31.50 multiplied by 12. Let me do that: 31.5 * 12. Hmm, 30*12 is 360, and 1.5*12 is 18, so total is 378 Rs. So he's paying back 378 Rs. in total.\n\nWait, so he borrowed 360 and paid back 378. That means the total interest is 378 minus 360, which is 18 Rs. So the interest over the year is 18 Rs.\n\nNow, to find the interest rate, I think we use the simple interest formula. Simple interest is calculated as I = P * R * T, where I is interest, P principal, R rate, T time. We need to find R.\n\nWe have I as 18 Rs., P as 360, T as 1 year (since it's 12 monthly installments). So plugging into the formula:\n\n18 = 360 * R * 1\n\nSo R would be 18 / 360 = 0.05.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where a man borrows Rs. 360 and pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50 each. The question is asking what the interest rate is. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on interest calculations, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nFirst, I remember that when someone takes a loan and pays it back in installments, the total amount paid back is more than the principal. The extra is the interest. So, in this case, the principal is 360 Rs, and each installment is 31.50 Rs for 12 months. Let me calculate the total amount he pays back.\n\nTotal repayment would be 12 installments multiplied by 31.50. Let me do that: 12 * 31.50. Hmm, 12 times 30 is 360, and 12 times 1.50 is 18, so total is 360 + 18 = 378 Rs. So he pays back 378 Rs in total.\n\nThe interest paid is the total repayment minus the principal. That would be 378 - 360 = 18 Rs. So the interest is 18 Rs over the period of 12 months.\n\nNow, to find the interest rate. Wait, what's the formula for the interest rate when it's an installment loan? I think it's simple interest, but I'm not entirely sure. Or maybe it's something else because the installments are monthly. Oh wait, the problem doesn't specify whether it's simple or compound interest. Hmm, but since it's installments, perhaps it's simple interest.\n\nWait, but when you pay installments, the interest is calculated on the principal for each period. Or is it the average balance? I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Each month, he pays back part of the principal and some interest. So the interest each month would be based on the remaining principal.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. The total interest is 18 Rs over the principal of 360. So the rate would be (Interest / Principal) * 100. But wait, that would be the annual rate. Because the time period is a year.\n\nSo the rate R would be (18 / 360) * 100. Let me compute that. 18 divided by 360 is 0.05. Multiply by 100 gives 5%. So the rate is 5% per annum. Looking at the options, D is 5%.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Is that correct? Because when you pay installments, the interest is applied on a reducing balance. So maybe the calculation is a bit different. Hmm, but in this case, the total interest is 18. So maybe the simple interest approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes when installments are made, the interest is calculated on the average balance. Let me think about that. The average balance would be (360 + 0)/2 = 180 Rs. So the interest is 18 Rs on an average balance of 180. Then the rate would be (18 / 180) * 100 = 10%. Oh, so that's 10%, which is option C.\n\nWait, but which approach is correct? I'm a bit confused now. The problem doesn't specify whether it's simple interest or some other method. But in personal loans, usually, it's simple interest on the initial principal. Or maybe it's compound interest, but that's more complicated.\n\nWait, another thought: the installments are monthly, so perhaps the interest is calculated monthly. Let's see. Suppose the interest is simple, so the rate per month would be R/12. But then the total interest would be principal * rate * time. Time is 1 year, but if calculated per month, maybe each installment has a part of the interest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct method is to calculate the effective interest rate using the present value of the installments. That might be more accurate because each installment reduces the principal over time.\n\nLet me try that approach. The present value of the installments is 360 Rs. Each installment is 31.50, and there are 12 of them. So the present value of an ordinary annuity formula is: PV = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r], where PMT is the monthly payment, n is the number of periods, and r is the monthly interest rate.\n\nSo, 360 = 31.50 * [(1 - (1 + r)^-12) / r ]\n\nHmm, but solving for r here might be a bit tricky. I don't remember the exact formula, but maybe I can approximate or see if one of the options fits.\n\nWait, but let's try plugging in the options to see which one fits. The options are 1.5%, 4.5%, 10%, 5%, 12%. These are annual rates, but perhaps we're to find the monthly rate. Wait, no, because the installments are monthly, so the rate is likely a monthly rate, but the options are annual.\n\nWait, maybe the options are annual rates, so perhaps the monthly rate is the annual rate divided by 12. Let me think.\n\nLet me consider each option as the annual rate, then compute the monthly rate and see if the PV equals 360.\n\nOption D is 5% annual rate. So the monthly rate would be 5% /12 \u2248 0.4167% per month.\n\nLet me compute the PV with r=0.4167% per month.\n\nPV = 31.50 * [ (1 - (1 + 0.004167)^-12 ) / 0.004167 ]\n\nCalculating (1.004167)^-12. Let me compute 1.004167^12. Approximately, since 0.4167% is 1/24, 1.004167^12 is roughly (1 + 0.004167*12) = 1.05? Because (1 + r)^n \u2248 e^(rn) for small r, but that's an approximation. Alternatively, since 12 * 0.4167 is 5% approximately. So (1.004167)^12 \u2248 1.05.\n\nSo 1/(1.004167)^12 \u2248 1/1.05 \u2248 0.9524.\n\nSo (1 - 0.9524) = 0.0476.\n\nDivide that by 0.004167: 0.0476 / 0.004167 \u2248 11.428.\n\nThen PV \u2248 31.50 * 11.428 \u2248 31.50 * 11.428.\n\nCalculating 31.5 *11 is 346.5, 31.5 * 0.428\u224813.5, so total \u2248 360. So that's exactly 360. So that fits.\n\nSo the monthly rate is 0.4167%, which is 5% annual. So the correct rate is 5%, option D.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about simple interest, I got 5% as well. So that aligns.\n\nWait, but the other approach where I considered average balance gave 10%, but perhaps that's incorrect because it's not the correct method for installment loans.\n\nSo the correct answer is D)5%.\n",
