      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a pen company. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the company produces pens, and on average, 10% are defective and rejected. So they don't pack those. They deliver 7200 pens to the wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. The company estimates a profit of 25% on all the manufactured pens. I need to find the manufactured cost of each pen.\n\nWait, so the problem is about cost, profit, and figuring out the cost per pen. Let me think about what each part means.\n\nFirst, the company produces some number of pens, but 10% are defective. So only 90% are good and are delivered. They delivered 7200 pens, which is 90% of what they produced. So I can find the total number produced by figuring out 7200 is 90% of it.\n\nLet me do that calculation. If 7200 is 90%, then total produced pens would be 7200 / 0.9. Let me calculate that. 7200 divided by 0.9 is 8000. So they produced 8000 pens in total.\n\nNow, the company sells each pen for Rs. 10, and they delivered 7200 pens. So the revenue from this sale is 7200 * 10 = Rs. 72,000. But wait, the company's profit is on all the manufactured pens, which is 25%. So the profit is calculated on the total cost of manufacturing all the pens, including the defective ones.\n\nWait, so the cost includes all the pens they made, which is 8000 pens. Let me denote the cost per pen as 'C'. So the total manufacturing cost is 8000 * C.\n\nThe profit is 25% on the total cost. So the profit amount is 25% of the total cost, which is 0.25 * (8000 * C).\n\nSo the selling price or revenue is equal to total cost plus profit. So revenue = total cost + profit. Revenue is 72,000, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo putting that into an equation: 72,000 = (8000 * C) + (0.25 * 8000 * C). Let me simplify that.\n\nThe total cost is 8000C, and the profit is 2000C (since 0.25 * 8000 is 2000). So 8000C + 2000C = 10,000C.\n\nSo 72,000 = 10,000C. Then, solving for C, we get C = 72,000 / 10,000. 72 divided by 10 is 7.2. So C is 7.2 Rs per pen.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check if I got the profit part right. The company's overall profit is 25% on all the manufactured pens. So profit is 25% of the total manufacturing cost. So total selling price should be cost plus 25% of cost.\n\nAlternatively, selling price is cost multiplied by 1.25. So 72,000 = 8000 * C * 1.25.\n\nLet me compute that. 8000 * C * 1.25 = 72,000. 8000 * 1.25 is 10,000. So 10,000C =72,000. So C is 7.2 again.\n\nSo the cost per pen is Rs.7.2. Looking at the options, option B is 7.2. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but I should double-check my reasoning. Did I account for all the costs correctly? The company sells 7200 pens, but they made 8000, with 10% defective. So the cost is for all 8000 pens, and the revenue is from 7200 pens. The profit is on the total cost of all 8000 pens. So yeah, the calculation seems right.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe company produces pens, with 10% defective, meaning only 90% of the total produced pens are delivered.

So their cost is for all the pens they make, and the profit is calculated on that total cost. \n\nLet me think about this. Profit is calculated as (Selling Price - Cost Price) / Cost Price * 100%, right? So the company's profit is 25% on the total cost. \n\nBut wait, the company sells only the good pens. So first, I should figure out how many pens they actually made. Because 10% are defective, so 90% are good. Let's let M be the total number of pens manufactured. Then 90% of M is equal to 7200, because that's how many they deliver. \n\nSo, 0.9 * M = 7200. To find M, divide both sides by 0.9. So M = 7200 / 0.9. Let me compute that. 7200 divided by 0.9 is the same as 7200 * (10/9) which is 8000. So they made 8000 pens in total. \n\nSo the total manufacturing cost is for 8000 pens. Let's denote the cost per pen as C. So total cost is 8000 * C. \n\nThe revenue from sales is 72,000 Rs, as calculated before. Now, profit is 25% on the total cost. So profit is 0.25 * (8000*C). \n\nBut wait, profit is also equal to total revenue minus total cost. So:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Total Cost\n0.25 * (8000 * C) = 72000 - (8000 * C)\n\nLet me write that equation out:\n\n0.25 * 8000 C = 72000 - 8000 C\n\nCalculating 0.25 *8000: 0.25 *8000 is 2000. So:\n\n2000 C = 72000 - 8000 C\n\nNow, bring the 8000C to the left side by adding 8000C to both sides:\n\n2000 C + 8000 C = 72000\n\nThat's 10000 C = 72000\n\nSo C = 72000 / 10000 = 7.2\n\nWait, that would make the cost per pen Rs.7.2. Let me check the options. Option B is 7.2, so that would be the answer.\n\nBut wait a second, let me double-check. Because sometimes profit calculations can be tricky. The company sells 7200 pens, which is 90% of production. The total cost is 8000 pens multiplied by 7.2 per pen, which is 8000 *7.2 = 57,600. \n\nThe revenue is 7200 *10=72,000. So profit is 72,000 -57,600=14,400. \n\nWhat's the profit percentage? Profit is 14,400 over the total cost of 57,600. 14,400 /57,600 = 0.25, which is 25%. Yep, that matches the given profit percentage. So yes, the cost per pen is 7.2. \n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a pen company. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit confused at first, but I'll take it slow.\n\nAlright, the company produces pens, and on average, 10% are defective and rejected before packing. So that means for every 100 pens they make, 10 are thrown away, leaving 90 that are good. Got it.\n\nThey have to deliver 7200 pens to a wholesaler. Each pen is sold at Rs. 10. So the total revenue from selling 7200 pens would be 7200 multiplied by 10. Let me calculate that: 7200 * 10 = 72,000 Rs.\n\nThe company estimates an overall profit of 25% on all the manufactured pens. Hmm, profit is calculated on the cost, right? So profit is 25% of the cost. Wait, but what exactly is the cost here? I think it's the cost to produce each pen, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nWait, the question is asking for the manufactured cost of each pen. So each pen costs them some amount, let's call it 'C' Rs. But since 10% are defective, they have to make more pens than they actually sell to account for the defective ones.\n\nSo, for every 90 good pens, they make 100 pens. So the number of pens they actually produce (let's call it N) is higher than the 7200 they deliver. Because 10% are defective, the number of good pens is 90% of the total produced. So, if they deliver 7200 good pens, how many did they make in total?\n\nLet me think. If 90% of N is 7200, then N = 7200 / 0.9. Let me calculate that. 7200 divided by 0.9 is 8000. So they made 8000 pens in total. Because 10% are defective, 10% of 8000 is 800, so 8000 - 800 = 7200, which matches the delivery.\n\nNow, the total cost of manufacturing all those 8000 pens is 8000 * C. Right? Because each pen costs C.\n\nThe total revenue is 7200 pens * Rs.10 each = 72,000 Rs, as I calculated earlier.\n\nThe profit is 25% on all the manufactured pens. So the profit is 25% of the total cost. So profit = 0.25 * (8000*C).\n\nWait, but profit is calculated as revenue minus cost. So:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\n0.25 * Cost = Revenue - Cost\nWait, no. Wait, the profit is 25% of the cost. So Profit = 0.25 * Cost.\n\nAlternatively, the profit margin is 25%, so Profit = 25% of Cost. So:\n\nRevenue = Cost + Profit\nRevenue = Cost + 0.25 * Cost\nRevenue = 1.25 * Cost\n\nSo 72,000 = 1.25 * (8000 * C)\n\nLet me write that equation:\n\n72,000 = 1.25 * (8000 * C)\n\nSolving for C:\n\nFirst, compute 8000 * C. Let's call that (8000C).\n\nThen, 1.25 * (8000C) = 72,000.\n\nSo, 1.25 * 8000C = 72,000.\n\nCompute 1.25 * 8000: 1.25 * 8000 = 10,000.\n\nSo, 10,000 * C = 72,000.\n\nThen, C = 72,000 / 10,000 = 7.2.\n\nWait, so the cost per pen is Rs.7.2? But wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait, let me go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nTotal good pens delivered: 7200. Each sold for 10, so revenue 72000.\n\nTotal produced pens: 7200 / 0.9 = 8000.\n\nTotal cost: 8000 * C.\n\nProfit is 25% of the cost. So, Profit = 0.25 * (8000*C).\n\nRevenue is cost plus profit: 8000C + 0.25*8000C = 1.25*(8000C) = 72,000.\n\nSo 1.25 * 8000C = 72,000.\n\n1.25 * 8000 = 10,000. So 10,000 C =72,000. So C=7.2.\n\nSo each pen's manufacturing cost is 7.2 Rs.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 7.2.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again about the profit calculation. Another way to think is that the selling price is 10, which includes a 25% profit on the cost. So the cost plus 25% of cost is the selling price.\n\nSo SP = C + 0.25C = 1.25C.\n\nSo, 10 = 1.25C \u2192 C = 10 / 1.25 = 8. But wait, that's a different approach. Hmm, that gives a different answer. Which is correct?\n\nWait, no. Because in this approach, we're considering each pen's cost. But wait, because they have to produce more pens due to the defective rate, the per pen cost calculation might be different.\n\nWait, perhaps the profit is calculated on the total cost, not on each pen. So in the first approach, it's correct.\n\nLet me think: the company's overall profit is 25% on all the manufactured pens. So, the total profit is 25% of the total cost.\n\nSo, total cost is 8000 * C.\n\nProfit is 0.25 * (8000*C) = 2000 C.\n\nRevenue is 72000, which is equal to total cost plus profit: 8000C + 2000C = 10000 C.\n\nSo 10000 C = 72000 \u2192 C=7.2.\n\nYes, that's correct. So each pen's manufacturing cost is 7.2 Rs.\n\nSo the answer should be option B) Rs.7.2.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a pen company. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit confused at first, but I'll take it slow.\n\nAlright, the company produces pens, and on average, 10% are defective and rejected before packing. So that means for every 100 pens they make, 10 are thrown away, leaving 90 that are good. Got it.\n\nThey have to deliver 7200 pens to a wholesaler. Each pen is sold at Rs. 10. So the total revenue from selling 7200 pens would be 7200 multiplied by 10. Let me calculate that: 7200 * 10 = 72,000 Rs.\n\nThe company estimates an overall profit of 25% on all the manufactured pens. Hmm, profit is calculated on the cost, right? So profit is 25% of the cost. Wait, but what exactly is the cost here? I think it's the cost to produce each pen, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nWait, the question is asking for the manufactured cost of each pen. So each pen costs them some amount, let's call it 'C' Rs. But since 10% are defective, they have to make more pens than they actually sell to account for the defective ones.\n\nSo, for every 90 good pens, they make 100 pens. So the number of pens they actually produce (let's call it N) is higher than the 7200 they deliver. Because 10% are defective, the number of good pens is 90% of the total produced. So, if they deliver 7200 good pens, how many did they make in total?\n\nLet me think. If 90% of N is 7200, then N = 7200 / 0.9. Let me calculate that. 7200 divided by 0.9 is 8000. So they made 8000 pens in total. Because 10% are defective, 10% of 8000 is 800, so 8000 - 800 = 7200, which matches the delivery.\n\nNow, the total cost of manufacturing all those 8000 pens is 8000 * C. Right? Because each pen costs C.\n\nThe total revenue is 7200 pens * Rs.10 each = 72,000 Rs, as I calculated earlier.\n\nThe profit is 25% on all the manufactured pens. So the profit is 25% of the total cost. So profit = 0.25 * (8000*C).\n\nWait, but profit is calculated as revenue minus cost. So:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\n0.25 * Cost = Revenue - Cost\nWait, no. Wait, the profit is 25% of the cost. So Profit = 0.25 * Cost.\n\nAlternatively, the profit margin is 25%, so Profit = 25% of Cost. So:\n\nRevenue = Cost + Profit\nRevenue = Cost + 0.25 * Cost\nRevenue = 1.25 * Cost\n\nSo 72,000 = 1.25 * (8000 * C)\n\nLet me write that equation:\n\n72,000 = 1.25 * (8000 * C)\n\nSolving for C:\n\nFirst, compute 8000 * C. Let's call that (8000C).\n\nThen, 1.25 * (8000C) = 72,000.\n\nSo, 1.25 * 8000C = 72,000.\n\nCompute 1.25 * 8000: 1.25 * 8000 = 10,000.\n\nSo, 10,000 * C = 72,000.\n\nThen, C = 72,000 / 10,000 = 7.2.\n\nWait, so the cost per pen is Rs.7.2? But wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait, let me go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nTotal good pens delivered: 7200. Each sold for 10, so revenue 72000.\n\nTotal produced pens: 7200 / 0.9 = 8000.\n\nTotal cost: 8000 * C.\n\nProfit is 25% of the cost. So, Profit = 0.25 * (8000*C).\n\nRevenue is cost plus profit: 8000C + 0.25*8000C = 1.25*(8000C) = 72,000.\n\nSo 1.25 * 8000C = 72,000.\n\n1.25 * 8000 = 10,000. So 10,000 C =72,000. So C=7.2.\n\nSo each pen's manufacturing cost is 7.2 Rs.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 7.2.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again about the profit calculation. Another way to think is that the selling price is 10, which includes a 25% profit on the cost. So the cost plus 25% of cost is the selling price.\n\nSo SP = C + 0.25C = 1.25C.\n\nSo, 10 = 1.25C \u2192 C = 10 / 1.25 = 8. But wait, that's a different approach. Hmm, that gives a different answer.

So if the total cost is C, then profit is 0.25 * C. And revenue is cost plus profit.\n\nSo revenue = C + 0.25 C = 1.25 C.\n\nBut wait, the revenue is 72,000, so 1.25 C = 72,000. Therefore, C = 72,000 / 1.25. Let me calculate that.\n\n72,000 divided by 1.25. Hmm, 72,000 / 1.25. Well, 1.25 is 5/4, so dividing by 5/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/5. So 72,000 * 4 = 288,000; then divide by 5: 288,000 /5 = 57,600. So the total cost is 57,600 Rs.\n\nBut wait, this total cost is the cost for all the pens they manufactured, right?

Wait, the 7200 pens are the ones delivered, but since 10% are defective, that means the company must have produced more than 7200 pens. Because 10% are rejected, only 90% are good and sold.\n\nRight, so let's calculate how many pens were actually produced. If 90% of the produced pens are 7200, then the total produced is 7200 divided by 0.9. Let me compute that: 7200 / 0.9 equals 8000 pens. So the company made 8000 pens, but 10% (800 pens) are defective and rejected.\n\nNow, the company sells the 7200 pens at Rs. 10 each. So the revenue from sales is 7200 * 10.

Let's add 8000C to both sides:\n\n2000C + 8000C = 72000\n\nThat gives 10000C = 72000.\n\nSo, C = 72000 / 10000 = 7.2.\n\nWait, so the cost per pen is Rs. 7.2? But let me double-check because that's one of the options.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is Rs. 7.2. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I account for all the costs correctly? The 8000 pens are the total produced, and the cost is per pen. So yes, each pen costs Rs.7.2 to make.\n\nWait another thing: The profit is on the manufactured pens, so it's 25% on the total manufacturing cost. So the selling price includes the cost plus 25% profit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is to find the selling price per pen in terms of cost, but in this case, they're selling 7200 pens at Rs.10 each, which brings in 72,000.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: Let's think about the total cost, total revenue, and profit.\n\nTotal cost (TC) = number of pens produced * cost per pen = 8000 * C.\n\nTotal revenue (TR) = 7200 * 10 = 72,000.\n\nProfit is TR - TC. The company's profit is 25% of TC. So,\n\nTR - TC = 0.25 * TC.\n\nSo,\n\nTR = TC + 0.25 TC = 1.25 TC.\n\nWhich means 72,000 = 1.25 * (8000 * C).\n\nLet me compute 8000 * C: that's 8000C.\n\nSo 72,000 = 1.25 * 8000C.\n\nCalculate 1.25 *8000 = 10,000.\n\nSo 72,000 = 10,000 C \u2192 C = 7.2.\n\nSame result as before. So the cost per pen is 7.2, which is option B.\n\nWait, but wait another thought: The 25% profit is on the manufacturing cost. So if the total cost is 8000 *7.2=57,600. Then profit is 25% of 57,600, which is 14,400. So total revenue should be 57,600 +14,400 =72,000, which matches the 7200 *10=72,000.\n\nSo yes, the calculations are correct.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe company produces pens, with 10% defective and rejected, meaning only 90% of the produced pens are sold.

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nSo, the company makes pens, and on average 10% are defective and rejected. They're delivering 7200 pens to the wholesaler, each sold at Rs. 10. The company expects a 25% overall profit on all the pens they manufacture. I need to find the manufacturing cost per pen.\n\nHmm. Wait, the 7200 pens are the ones delivered, but since 10% are defective, that means the company must have produced more than 7200 pens. Because 10% are rejected, only 90% are good and sold.\n\nRight, so let's calculate how many pens were actually produced. If 90% of the produced pens are 7200, then the total produced is 7200 divided by 0.9. Let me compute that: 7200 / 0.9 equals 8000 pens. So the company made 8000 pens, but 10% (800 pens) are defective and rejected.\n\nNow, the company sells the 7200 pens at Rs. 10 each. So the revenue from sales is 7200 * 10. Let's see: 7200 * 10 is 72,000 Rs.\n\nThe company has a profit of 25% on all manufactured pens. So their cost is the manufacturing cost, and the profit is 25% of that cost. Let me denote the manufacturing cost per pen as C. So the total manufacturing cost would be 8000 * C.\n\nProfit is calculated on the cost, right? So profit is 25% of the total cost. So, profit = 0.25 * (8000 * C).\n\nWait, but profit is also equal to revenue minus cost. So, profit = revenue - total manufacturing cost.\n\nPutting it together: 0.25*(8000*C) = 72,000 - (8000*C).\n\nLet me write that equation:\n\n0.25 * (8000*C) = 72000 - 8000*C\n\nSimplify the left side: 0.25 * 8000 is 2000, so 2000*C.\n\nSo equation becomes: 2000C = 72000 - 8000C.\n\nNow, I'll move all terms to one side. Let's add 8000C to both sides:\n\n2000C + 8000C = 72000\n\nThat gives 10000C = 72000.\n\nSo, C = 72000 / 10000 = 7.2.\n\nWait, so the cost per pen is Rs. 7.2? But let me double-check because that's one of the options.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is Rs. 7.2. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again.

The company's profit is 25% of TC. So,\n\nTR - TC = 0.25 * TC.\n\nSo,\n\nTR = TC + 0.25 TC = 1.25 TC.\n\nWhich means 72,000 = 1.25 * (8000 * C).\n\nLet me compute 8000 * C: that's 8000C.\n\nSo 72,000 = 1.25 * 8000C.\n\nCalculate 1.25 *8000 = 10,000.\n\nSo 72,000 = 10,000 C \u2192 C = 7.2.\n\nSame result as before.

So total revenue should be 57,600 +14,400 =72,000, which matches the 7200 *10=72,000.\n\nSo yes, the calculations are correct.\n\n\nThe company produces pens, with 10% defective and rejected, meaning only 90% of the produced pens are sold.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about a pen company and their costs and profits. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on these types of problems, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nAlright, so the company produces pens, and on average 10% of them are defective and rejected. That means out of every 100 pens, 10 are defective, leaving 90 that are good. So, when they talk about delivering pens to the wholesaler, they have to account for the defective ones not being counted as part of the sale.\n\nThe company promises to deliver 7200 pens to the wholesaler. Each pen is sold for Rs. 10. So first, let's calculate the total revenue from this sale. That should be 7200 pens multiplied by Rs. 10 each. Let me do that: 7200 * 10 equals Rs. 72,000. So their total revenue is Rs. 72,000.\n\nNow, the company estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. Wait, profit on all the manufactured pens? So, the profit is based on the total number of pens they make, not just the good ones that are sold. Because they have to account for the defective ones as part of their manufacturing cost.\n\nLet me think about what the terms mean here. Profit is calculated as (Revenue - Cost) / Cost, right? Or wait, profit percentage is usually (Profit / Cost) * 100. So, if the overall profit is 25%, that means Profit = 25% of Cost. So, Profit = 0.25 * Cost.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the profit is on the overall manufactured pens. So, their revenue is Rs. 72,000, and that comes from selling 7200 pens. But the total number of pens they make must be more because 10% are defective. So, if they delivered 7200 good pens, the total produced must be higher.\n\nLet me calculate that. If 10% are defective, then 90% are good. Let me denote the total produced pens as X. So, 90% of X is equal to 7200. So, 0.9 * X = 7200. To find X, I can divide 7200 by 0.9. Let me do that: 7200 divided by 0.9 is 8000. So they made 8000 pens in total.\n\nNow, the cost is for all 8000 pens. The revenue is from selling 7200 pens. So, the revenue is Rs. 72,000. The cost is the manufacturing cost for all 8000 pens.\n\nThe company's profit is 25% on all the manufactured pens. So, Profit = 25% of the total cost. Let me denote the total cost as C. So, Profit = 0.25 * C.\n\nBut Profit is also equal to Revenue minus Cost. So,\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\n0.25 C = 72,000 - C\n\nHmm, let me solve this equation. Bring the C terms together:\n\n0.25 C + C = 72,000\n1.25 C = 72,000\nSo, C = 72,000 / 1.25\n\nCalculating that: 72,000 divided by 1.25. Let's see, 72,000 / 1.25. Well, 72,000 divided by 5 is 14,400, and since 1.25 is 5/4, dividing by 1.25 is the same as multiplying by 4/5. So, 72,000 * 4 = 288,000, then divided by 5 is 57,600. Wait, that's not right. Wait, no, wait. Let me try again.\n\nWait, 1.25 is 5/4. So, 72,000 divided by 5/4 is 72,000 multiplied by 4/5. 72,000 * 4 is 288,000. Divided by 5 is 57,600. So, C is 57,600.\n\nWait, that can't be right because if the cost is 57,600 and revenue is 72,000, then the profit is 14,400. 14,400 / 57,600 is 0.25, which is 25%, so that checks out. So, the total cost is 57,600.\n\nWait, but wait, the question is asking for the manufactured cost of each pen. Oh, right, because the total cost is for all 8000 pens. So, each pen's cost is total cost divided by total pens. So, 57,600 divided by 8000.\n\nLet me calculate that: 57,600 / 8000. Hmm, 8000 goes into 57,600 how many times? 8000 * 7 = 56,000. 57,600 - 56,000 = 1,600. 8000 * 0.2 is 1,600. So, 7.2 times. So, 7.2 Rs per pen.\n\nWait, so each pen costs Rs. 7.2 to manufacture. Looking at the options, option B is 7.2. So the answer should be B.\n\nLet me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. 10% defective, so 90% good. 7200 good pens mean 7200 = 0.9 * X \u2192 X=8000. Correct.\n2. Total cost is for 8000 pens. Let C be the total cost. Profit is 25% of C.\n3. Revenue is 7200 * 10 = 72,000.\n4. Profit = Revenue - Cost \u2192 0.25 C = 72,000 - C.\n5. Solving: 1.25 C =72,000 \u2192 C=57,600. Correct.\n6. Per pen cost: 57,600 /8000 =7.2. Correct.\n",

So, C is 57,600.\n\nWait, that can't be right because if the cost is 57,600 and revenue is 72,000, then the profit is 14,400. 14,400 / 57,600 is 0.25, which is 25%, so that checks out. So, the total cost is 57,600.\n\nWait, but wait, the question is asking for the manufactured cost of each pen. Oh, right, because the total cost is for all 8000 pens. So, each pen's cost is total cost divided by total pens. So, 57,600 divided by 8000.\n\nLet me calculate that: 57,600 / 8000. Hmm, 8000 goes into 57,600 how many times? 8000 * 7 = 56,000. 57,600 - 56,000 = 1,600. 8000 * 0.2 is 1,600. So, 7.2 times. So, 7.2 Rs per pen.\n\nWait, so each pen costs Rs. 7.2 to manufacture.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about the pen company's manufacturing cost. Let me read it again and think through each part.\n\nThe company produces pens, and on average, 10% are defective and rejected. So that means only 90% of the pens make it through to being sold. They have a deal to deliver 7200 pens to a wholesaler, and each pen is sold for Rs. 10. The company expects a 25% overall profit on all the pens they make. I need to find the manufacturing cost of each pen.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how many pens the company actually produces, not just the ones that are sold. Since 10% are defective, they reject those. So if they end up selling 7200 pens, those are the good ones. Let me represent the total number of pens produced as N. Out of N, 10% are defective, so 90% are good. So 0.9 * N = 7200 pens. \n\nWait, wait, yes. So N = 7200 / 0.9. Let me calculate that. 7200 divided by 0.9 is 8000. So the company produces 8000 pens in total.\n\nNow, the company sells 7200 pens at Rs. 10 each. So the total revenue from sales is 7200 * 10. Let me compute that: 7200 * 10 = 72,000 Rs.\n\nThe company's profit is 25% on all the manufactured pens. Wait, so profit is calculated on the cost of manufacturing all the pens, including the defective ones. Because the 25% profit is overall, based on all production.\n\nSo, the profit is 25% of the total manufacturing cost. Let me denote the manufacturing cost per pen as C. So the total manufacturing cost for all N pens is N * C, which is 8000 * C.\n\nProfit is 25% of that cost, so Profit = 0.25 * (8000 * C).\n\nBut profit is also equal to the revenue minus the total manufacturing cost. So:\n\nRevenue - Total Cost = Profit\n72,000 - (8000 * C) = 0.25 * (8000 * C)\n\nLet me write this equation again:\n\n72,000 = (8000 * C) + 0.25 * (8000 * C)\n\nWait, no, Profit is Revenue minus Cost, which equals 25% of Cost. So:\n\nRevenue = Cost + Profit\n72,000 = (8000 * C) + 0.25*(8000 * C)\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because Profit is 25% of the Cost, so the total revenue is 125% of the Cost.\n\nSo 72,000 = 1.25 * (8000 * C)\n\nLet me compute 8000 * C first. Let's denote that as Total Cost.\n\nSo 72,000 = 1.25 * (Total Cost)\nWhich means Total Cost = 72,000 / 1.25.\n\nCalculating that: 72,000 divided by 1.25. Hmm, 72,000 / 1.25. Let's see, 1.25 is 5/4, so dividing by 5/4 is multiplying by 4/5. So 72,000 * 4 = 288,000; 288,000 /5 = 57,600. So the total cost is 57,600 Rs.\n\nWait, but the total cost is 8000 pens * C. So 8000 * C = 57,600.\n\nSo C = 57,600 / 8000.\n\nLet me compute that. 57,600 divided by 8000.\n\nWell, 8000 * 7 = 56,000. So 57,600 -56,000 = 1,600. 1,600 /8000 = 0.2. So 7 + 0.2 = 7.2.\n\nWait, so C is 7.2 Rs per pen.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations. Because sometimes when dealing with profits, it's easy to get confused.\n\nSo, the company's total cost is 8000 * 7.2 = 57,600.\n\nProfit is 25% of 57,600 = 0.25 *57,600=14,400.\n\nSo Revenue is Cost + Profit = 57,600 +14,400 =72,000. Which matches the given revenue (7200 *10 =72,000). So that checks out.\n\nSo the manufacturing cost per pen is Rs.7.2, which is option B.\n\nWait, but let me look at the options. Option B is 7.2, which is what I got. So that should be the correct answer.\n",

They have a deal to deliver 7200 pens to a wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. Their estimated overall profit is 25%. We need to find the manufactured cost of each pen.\n\nWait, so the company sells 7200 pens, but they have a 10% defect rate. That means they have to produce more than 7200 pens to account for the defective ones. Because 10% are rejected, so 90% are good. So, the number of pens they actually produce should be higher than 7200.\n\nLet me think about that. If 10% are defective, then 90% are acceptable. So, the number of pens they need to produce (let's call it N) times 90% equals 7200. So, N * 0.9 = 7200. Solving for N, I divide both sides by 0.9. So N = 7200 / 0.9.
