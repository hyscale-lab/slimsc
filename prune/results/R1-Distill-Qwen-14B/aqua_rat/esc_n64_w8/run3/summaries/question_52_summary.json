      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. Let me read it again. The question is about a man who spends Rs. 3500 each month and saves 12 and a half percent of his income. I need to find his monthly income. The options are given as A to E, with E being none of these.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. The man spends a certain amount, and he saves a percentage of his income. So his income is the total, right? He uses part of it for spending and saves the rest. Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of his savings first.\n\nWait, the problem says he saves 12.5% of his income. So, if his income is, say, X, then he saves 12.5% of X. And the rest is what he spends, which is 3500.\n\nWait no, wait a second. Let me clarify. If he saves 12.5% of his income, then the amount he spends is the remaining percentage. Because his total income is spent plus saved.\n\nSo, 12.5% is saved. So that leaves 100% minus 12.5%, which is 87.5% spent. Because 100 -12.5 =87.5. So the amount he spends is 87.5% of his income.\n\nWait, wait. Or is it that he saves 12.5% of his income, and the rest is his expenditure. So, his expenditure is 100% minus 12.5% = 87.5% of his income. So, if his expenditure is 3500, that's 87.5% of his income.\n\nSo, the equation would be: 87.5% of X = 3500, where X is his income.\n\nAlternatively, we can write this as (87.5/100)*X = 3500.\n\nSo, to find X, I can rearrange that.\n\nX = 3500 * (100/87.5)\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nWait, what's 87.5 in terms of a fraction? 87.5 is 7/8 of 100. Because 7 divided by 8 is 0.875. So 87.5% is 7/8.\n\nSo, 87.5% is 7/8. So, 3500 is 7/8 of X. So to find X, multiply 3500 by 8/7.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n3500 * (8/7) = ?\n\n3500 divided by 7 is 500. 500 multiplied by 8 is 4000. So X is 4000.\n\nWait, that's one of the options. Let me check the options. Option C is Rs.4000.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my reasoning. Because sometimes I might get confused between the percentage saved and the percentage spent.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's say his income is X. He saves 12.5% of X, which is 0.125X. So he spends the rest, which is X - 0.125X = 0.875X. And that's equal to 3500.\n\nSo, 0.875X =3500 \u2192 X=3500 /0.875.\n\nLet me compute that. 3500 divided by 0.875.\n\nHmm, 0.875 is the same as 7/8. So 3500 divided by (7/8) is 3500 * (8/7).\n\nWhich is the same as before. 3500 *8=28000, divided by 7 is 4000. So, yes, X is 4000. So the correct answer is C, Rs.4000.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me check: if his income is 4000, then 12.5% is 500. So he saves 500, spends 3500. That adds up. 3500 +500=4000. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the answer should be option C.\n",

Then:\n\n\\[\n0.875X = 3500\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( X \\), divide both sides by 0.875:\n\n\\[\nX = \\frac{3500}{0.875}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( 0.875 = \\frac{7}{8} \\), this becomes:\n\n\\[\nX = 3500 \\times \\frac{8}{7}\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\nX = 3500 \\times \\frac{8}{7} = 500 \\times 8 = 4000\n\\]\n\nThus, the man's monthly income is Rs. 4000, which corresponds to option C.

So the spending plus the saving should equal the income.\n\nWait, let me think. His saving is 12.5%, so the amount he spends must be 100% minus 12.5%, which is 87.5% of his income.

So if his income is, let's say, x, then the amount he saves is 12.5% of x, and the amount he spends is x minus that saving.\n\nSo the equation would be: spending = income - savings.\n\nSavings are 12.5% of income, so 0.125 * x.\n\nSo, spending = x - 0.125x = 0.875x.\n\nBut we know he spends 3500. So 0.875x = 3500.\n\nTo find x, I can divide both sides by 0.875.\n\nLet me calculate 3500 divided by 0.875.\n\nHmm, 0.875 is the same as 7/8, right? Because 0.875 = 7/8. So dividing by 7/8 is the same as multiplying by 8/7.\n\nSo 3500 * (8/7) equals what?\n\nWait, 3500 divided by 7 is 500. Then 500 multiplied by 8 is 4000. So x is 4000.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 4000. So that must be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If his income is 4000, 12.5% is 500. He saves 500, so he spends 4000 - 500 = 3500. Yep, that matches the given information. So the correct answer should be C) Rs. 4000.\n\n\nThe man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12.5% of his income. Let his monthly income be \\( x \\). Since he saves 12.5% (or \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\)) of his income, the amount he spends is \\( x - \\frac{1}{8}x = \\frac{7}{8}x \\). Given that he spends Rs. 3500, we set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7}{8}x = 3500\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), multiply both sides by \\( \\frac{8}{7} \\):\n\n\\[\nx = 3500 \\times \\frac{8}{7} = 4000\n\\]\n\nThus, the man's monthly income is Rs. 4000. Verifying, 12.5% of 4000 is 500, so he spends \\( 4000 - 500 = 3500 \\), which matches the given information. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: C",

So if I can find out what his savings are, then I can figure out his total income because his income is the sum of his spending and his savings.\n\nLet me write down what I know. He spends Rs. 3500. Let's call his income 'I'. He saves 12.5% of I, which is 0.125 * I. So his savings plus his spending should equal his income. So the equation would be:\n\nSavings + Spending = Income\n0.125I + 3500 = I\n\nHmm, maybe I can rearrange this equation. Let me subtract 0.125I from both sides.

So 3500 divided by (7/8) is 3500 multiplied by (8/7). Let me compute that.\n\n3500 * 8 = 28000. Then 28000 divided by 7 is 4000. So I = 4000.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If his income is 4000, then 12.5% of that is 500. So his savings are 500, and his spending is 3500. 500 + 3500 = 4000, which matches the income. So that makes sense.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is Rs. 4000. So that must be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

The options are A) Rs. 4400, B) Rs. 4270, C) Rs. 4000, D) Rs. 3937.50, and E) None of these.\n\nHmm, alright. So, I need to find his monthly income based on his spending and savings.

So, his savings plus his spending should equal his total income.\n\nWait, or is it that the amount he saves is 12.5% of his income, and the rest is his spending? Yes, that's right.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out the man's monthly income. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says a man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 and a half percent of his income. I need to find his monthly income from the given options.\n\nHmm, so he spends a certain amount and saves a percentage of his income. Wait, saving is a percentage of his income, right? So his total income must be the sum of what he spends and what he saves.\n\nLet me think about the formula. If saving is a percentage of income, then:\n\nSavings = (Savings Percentage) * Income\nSo, Savings = (12.5/100) * Income.\n\nAnd since his total income is the sum of his expenditure and savings, I can write:\n\nIncome = Expenditure + Savings.\n\nBut wait, Savings is 12.5% of his income. So substituting that in:\n\nIncome = 3500 + (0.125 * Income).\n\nLet me write that as an equation:\n\nI = 3500 + 0.125I.\n\nI need to solve for I. So, subtract 0.125I from both sides.\n\nI - 0.125I = 3500.\n\nThat simplifies to 0.875I = 3500.\n\nSo, I = 3500 / 0.875.\n\nLet me calculate that. 3500 divided by 0.875. Hmm, what's 0.875 as a fraction? Oh right, 0.875 is 7/8. So dividing by 7/8 is the same as multiplying by 8/7.\n\nSo, 3500 * (8/7) = ?\n\n3500 divided by 7 is 500, right? Because 7*500 is 3500. Then 500 multiplied by 8 is 4000.\n\nSo, I = 4000. So his monthly income is Rs. 4000. Looking at the options, option C is 4000, so that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If his income is 4000, he saves 12.5% of that. 12.5% is 1/8. 4000 divided by 8 is 500. So he saves 500. He spends 3500, which is 4000 - 500 = 3500. Yep, that adds up. So the correct answer is C.\n",

To find his monthly income, we use the relationship:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Income} = \\text{Expenditure} + \\text{Savings}\n\\]\n\nSince savings are 12.5% of the income, we can write:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Income} = 3500 + 0.125 \\times \\text{Income}\n\\]\n\nRearranging and solving for income:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Income} - 0.125 \\times \\text{Income} = 3500\n\\]\n\\[\n0.875 \\times \\text{Income} = 3500\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Income} = \\frac{3500}{0.875} = 4000\n\\]\n\nThus, the man's monthly income is Rs. 4000. Verifying, 12.5% of 4000 is 500, and 4000 - 500 = 3500, which matches the expenditure. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: C",
