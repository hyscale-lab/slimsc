      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm. The question says, \"30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to its one third. What is the value of 50% of that number?\" And then there are options from A to E.\n\nAlright, let me break this down. I need to find 50% of the number, but first, I need to figure out what the number itself is. Let me call the number something, maybe 'x' for simplicity. So the problem says that when 30 is subtracted from x, it becomes one third of the original number. \n\nSo translating that into an equation: x minus 30 equals one third of x. Wait, no, actually, when you subtract 30 from x, the result is x's one third. So that's x - 30 = (1/3)x. Hmm, that makes sense. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I got the wording right. \"It is reduced to its one third.\" Oh, right, so the number after subtracting 30 is one third of what it was before. So yeah, that equation should be correct.\n\nNow, let's solve for x. So, x - 30 = (1/3)x. To get x by itself, I'll subtract (1/3)x from both sides. So, x - (1/3)x - 30 = 0. \n\nCalculating x - (1/3)x: that's the same as (2/3)x. So, (2/3)x - 30 = 0. Adding 30 to both sides gives (2/3)x = 30. \n\nTo solve for x, I'll multiply both sides by 3/2. So, x = 30 * (3/2). Let me compute that. 30 divided by 2 is 15, multiplied by 3 is 45. So, x is 45. \n\nWait, but the question asks for 50% of that number. 50% is the same as half. So, 45 divided by 2 is 22.5. Hmm, looking at the options, A is 22.5. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because 45 seems right, but maybe I made a mistake in the equation.\n\nWait, let me go through the equation again. x - 30 = (1/3)x. Subtract (1/3)x from both sides: (2/3)x - 30 = 0. So, (2/3)x = 30. Multiply both sides by 3/2: x = (30 * 3)/2 = 90/2 = 45. Yeah, that's correct. So 50% of 45 is 22.5, which is option A.\n\nWait, but wait another second. Let me think if I interpreted the question correctly. The problem says that subtracting 30 reduces the number to one third. So the original number is x, subtract 30, and you get x/3. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is saying that after subtracting 30, the number becomes one third of what it was before, so x -30 = x/3. Yeah, that's how I set it up, so the calculations should be correct. \n\nSo, 50% of 45 is 22.5. Looking at the options, option A is 22.5. So the answer should be A. But wait, let me check the options again. Oh, the options are A)22.5, B)84, C)21, D)24, E)25. So yes, A is 22.5. \n\nWait, but another thought: sometimes when I read problems quickly, I might mix up the wording. Like, maybe the problem says that 30 is subtracted from a number, making it a third of something else. But no, the way it's phrased is that the number is reduced to one third when 30 is subtracted. So yes, x-30 = x/3.\n\nAlternatively, could it be that 30 is subtracted from one third of the number? That would be a different equation. But the wording says, \"30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to its one third.\" So the number is x, subtract 30, becomes x/3. So my original approach was correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: if x is 45, subtract 30 gives 15. Is 15 equal to a third of 45? Yes, because 45 divided by 3 is 15. So that's correct.\n\nSo then, 50% of 45 is 22.5, which is option A. So the answer is A.\n",

What is the value of 50% of that number?\" Hmm, I think I get what it's asking, but let me break it down.\n\nAlright, let's see. There's a number, let's call it 'x'. When you subtract 30 from this number, it becomes one third of the original number. So, mathematically, that would be x minus 30 equals (1/3) of x. Oh wait, I should write that down to make it clearer.\n\nSo, the equation is: x - 30 = (1/3)x. Right. Now, I need to solve for x. Once I find x, the question is asking for 50% of that number, which is the same as half of x, so (1/2)x. But first, let's solve for x.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation. I'll subtract (1/3)x from both sides to get all the x terms on one side. So, x - (1/3)x - 30 = 0. Hmm, wait, maybe a better approach is to get all the x terms on one side first. Let me subtract (1/3)x from both sides. \n\nWait, maybe I should subtract x - (1/3)x. Let's see: x - (1/3)x is the same as (2/3)x. So, the equation becomes (2/3)x - 30 = 0. Oh, wait, no. Wait, the original equation is x - 30 = (1/3)x. So, to get x terms on one side, I can subtract (1/3)x from both sides. \n\nSo, x - (1/3)x -30 = 0. Let's compute x - (1/3)x.

To solve for x, I need to multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 2/3, which is 3/2. So, x = 30 * (3/2). Let me calculate that. 30 times 3 is 90, divided by 2 is 45. So, x is 45.\n\nWait, that can't be right because if I subtract 30 from 45, I get 15. Is 15 equal to one third of 45? Oh, yes, because 45 divided by 3 is 15. So that checks out.

Multiply both sides by 3/2 to get x by itself. So, x = 30 * (3/2). Let's calculate that. 30 times 3 is 90, divided by 2 is 45. So x is 45.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me check. If the number is 45, subtract 30 gives 15. And 15 is indeed a third of 45. Yep, that works.\n\nNow the question is asking for 50% of that number. So 50% is the same as half. So 45 divided by 2 is 22.5. Hmm, that would be option A)22.5.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Sometimes I might make a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through each step again.\n\nStarting with x - 30 = (1/3)x.\n\nSubtract (1/3)x from both sides: (2/3)x =30.\n\nMultiply both sides by 3/2: x= 30*(3/2)=45. Correct.\n\n50% of 45 is 22.5. So the answer should be A.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, B is 84. Did I miscalculate somewhere? Let me think again.\n\nWait, 45 is the original number. 50% is 22.5, which is option A. So that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: The number is 45. So, 50% is 22.5. So yes, option A is correct.\n\nI think that's right. So the answer should be A.\n\n\nThe problem states that when 30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to one third of itself. Let the number be \\( x \\). The equation can be written as:\n\n\\[\nx - 30 = \\frac{1}{3}x\n\\]\n\nRearranging the equation:\n\n\\[\nx - \\frac{1}{3}x = 30 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{2}{3}x = 30\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = 30 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 45\n\\]\n\nThe problem asks for 50% of this number. Since 50% is equivalent to half, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{50}{100} \\times 45 = \\frac{45}{2} = 22.5\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of 50% of the number is **22.5**, which corresponds to option A.\n\nAnswer: A",

Wait, no, maybe it's better to rearrange the equation first.\n\nAlternatively, I can bring the (1/3)x to the left and the 30 to the right. Wait, no, perhaps I should subtract (1/3)x from both sides. Let me do that.\n\nSo, x - (1/3)x = 30. Hmm, combining like terms on the left. x is the same as (3/3)x, so (3/3)x minus (1/3)x is (2/3)x. So, (2/3)x equals 30.\n\nTo find x, I can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of (2/3), which is (3/2). So, x = 30 * (3/2). Let me calculate that. 30 times 3 is 90, divided by 2 is 45. So x is 45.\n\nWait, so the number is 45. The question then asks for 50% of that number. 50% is the same as half. So half of 45 is 22.5. Let me check the options. Option A is 22.5, so that's one of the choices.\n\nWait a minute, did I do that correctly? Let me double-check my steps. \n\nStarting with the equation: x -30 = (1/3)x. Subtract (1/3)x from both sides: (2/3)x =30. Multiply both sides by 3/2: x=45. Yep, that's right. 50% of 45 is indeed 22.5. So the answer should be option A.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options again, option B is 84, which is a higher number. Did I make a mistake in my calculation? Hmm. Let me see. No, the steps seem correct. Wait, perhaps the problem says when 30 is subtracted, it's reduced to one third of the original. So, x -30 is (1/3)x. That's correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: if x is the original number, then (x -30) = x/3. So, x - x/3 =30. Which is (2x/3)=30. So 2x=90, x=45. Same result. So 50% is 22.5, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, I just noticed that option B is 84. Hmm, perhaps I've misread the question. Let me check again. It says, 30 is subtracted from the number, it's reduced to its one third. So, the result after subtraction is one third of the original number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the wording. Could it mean that 30 is subtracted, and the result is one third of the new number? No, that wouldn't make sense because then the equation would be different. But the way it's phrased, \"it is reduced to its one third,\" the 'it' refers to the number after subtraction. So, yes, it's one third of the original number.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me try plugging in the options to see which one works. Let's say the number is 45, as I found earlier. Subtracting 30 gives 15, which is indeed 45's one third. So that works.\n\nBut let's consider option B, which is 84. If the number is 84, subtracting 30 gives 54. Is 54 equal to 84's one third? 84 divided by 3 is 28. So 54 is not 28, so that's wrong. So B is incorrect.\n\nSo, I think I did it right. The correct answer is 22.5, which is option A.\n",

When we subtract 30 from this number, it becomes one third of the original number. So, mathematically, I think that translates to x - 30 = (1/3) * x.\n\nWait, does that make sense?
