      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem about the shop assistant's salary. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it. \n\nThe question says that the monthly salary S is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. We need to find out what the monthly sales should be so that her salary reaches $1500. \n\nHmm, okay. So, let's break it down. The total salary S is made up of two parts: a fixed part and a variable part based on sales. The fixed part is $500, and then she gets 5% of the sales. So mathematically, I think the formula would be S = 500 + 0.05 * sales. \n\nWait, the sales are the amount she makes from sales, right? So if her sales are X dollars, then she gets 5% of X as a commission. \n\nThe target is to find when S equals $1500. So I need to set up the equation and solve for X. Let me write that out.\n\nSo, equation: 1500 = 500 + 0.05 * X.\n\nI can subtract 500 from both sides to isolate the variable part. So 1500 - 500 is 1000. So 1000 = 0.05 * X.\n\nNow, to find X, I need to divide both sides by 0.05. Let me calculate that. 1000 divided by 0.05. Hmm, 0.05 is the same as 5 hundredths. So dividing by 0.05 is the same as multiplying by 20, because 1 divided by 0.05 is 20. So 1000 * 20 is 20,000. \n\nSo X would be $20,000. Looking at the options, option D is $20,000. So that should be the answer. \n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to be sure. Maybe I made a mistake with the division. \n\nSo 0.05 times what gives 1000? Let's think: 0.05 is 5%, which is 1/20. So 1/20 of X is 1000. Therefore, X must be 1000 * 20, which is 20,000. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the correct answer should be D) $20,000.\n",

The goal is to find out what the monthly sales need to be so that her salary reaches $1500.

Let me denote the monthly sales as 'x'. So the equation would be S = 500 + 0.05x. Right?\n\nWait, yes, because 5% is the same as 0.05 in decimal.

So, substituting S with 1500, the equation becomes: 1500 = 500 + 0.05X. \n\nNow, I need to solve for X. Let me subtract 500 from both sides first. So, 1500 minus 500 is 1000. That gives me 1000 = 0.05X. \n\nWait, so 0.05 times X equals 1000. To find X, I should divide both sides by 0.05. Let me do that. 1000 divided by 0.05... Hmm, 0.05 is the same as 5 hundredths, so dividing by 0.05 is the same as multiplying by 20. Because 1 divided by 0.05 is 20. So, 1000 * 20 is 20,000. \n\nSo, X would be 20,000. That's the monthly sales needed. Let me check the options. Option D is 20,000. So, that should be the correct answer. \n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations. Let's plug X back into the original equation. So, 0.05 times 20,000 is 1000. Adding the fixed 500, that's 1500. Yep, that adds up correctly. So, yes, D is the right choice.\n\n\nTo determine the monthly sales required for the shop assistant's salary to reach $1500, we start with the given formula for her salary:\n\n\\[\nS = 500 + 0.05 \\times \\text{sales}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( S \\) is the total salary, and \"sales\" is the variable representing monthly sales. We want \\( S \\) to equal $1500, so we substitute \\( S \\) with 1500:\n\n\\[\n1500 = 500 + 0.05 \\times \\text{sales}\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 500 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n1000 = 0.05 \\times \\text{sales}\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \"sales,\" divide both sides by 0.05:\n\n\\[\n\\text{sales} = \\frac{1000}{0.05} = 20,000\n\\]\n\nThus, the monthly sales must be $20,000. Verifying this by plugging it back into the original equation confirms that the calculations are correct. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: D",

They want to find out what her monthly sales need to be so that her total salary is $1500.\n\nWait, right, so I think I need to set up an equation here. The total salary is the fixed $500 plus 5% of the sales. Let me denote the sales as 'x'. So the equation would be:\n\nS = 500 + 0.05 * x\n\nAnd we know that S needs to be $1500.

Let's break it down. \n\nSo her salary S is equal to 500 plus 5% of her sales. Let's denote her sales as 'x'. So the equation would be S = 500 + 0.05x. And we know that S needs to be 1500. So I can plug that into the equation and solve for x.\n\nWait, let me write that out. 1500 equals 500 plus 5% of x. So 1500 = 500 + 0.05x. \n\nNow I'll subtract 500 from both sides to get the 0.05x by itself. So 1500 minus 500 is 1000. So 1000 = 0.05x. \n\nTo find x, I need to divide both sides by 0.05. So x equals 1000 divided by 0.05. Let me do that calculation. 1000 divided by 0.05 is the same as 1000 multiplied by 20, because 1/0.05 is 20. So 1000 *20 is 20,000. \n\nSo x is 20,000. That means her sales need to be $20,000 for her salary to be $1500. \n\nLooking at the options, option D is $20,000. So the answer should be D. \n\nWait, but let me double-check my math. So 5% of 20,000 is 1000. Then adding the fixed 500 gives 1500. Yep, that adds up correctly. So I think D is correct.\n\n\nTo determine the monthly sales required for the shop assistant's salary to reach $1500, we start with the given salary formula:\n\n\\[\nS = 500 + 0.05x\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( S \\) is the total salary, and \\( x \\) is the monthly sales. We know \\( S = 1500 \\), so we substitute this into the equation:\n\n\\[\n1500 = 500 + 0.05x\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 500 from both sides gives:\n\n\\[\n1000 = 0.05x\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), divide both sides by 0.05:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{1000}{0.05} = 20,000\n\\]\n\nThus, the monthly sales need to be $20,000 for the salary to reach $1500. Checking the options, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: D",
