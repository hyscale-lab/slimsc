      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The question is about a box containing balls numbered from 1 to n. We need to find the value of n such that there are 45 different ways to select two balls without picking the ball numbered 3.\n\nHmm, so the key point here is that when selecting two balls, the ball numbered 3 is excluded. So, I think that means we're only choosing from the balls that aren't number 3.\n\nWait, right. So the total number of balls is n. If we can't pick ball 3, then the number of available balls is n-1. Because we're excluding one ball (number 3), so we're left with n-1 balls to choose from.\n\nNow, the problem says that the number of ways to choose two balls from these (n-1) balls is 45. So, I need to calculate the combination of (n-1) balls taken two at a time, and set that equal to 45.\n\nThe formula for combinations is C(k, 2) = k*(k-1)/2. So in this case, C(n-1, 2) = 45.\n\nLet me write that down: (n-1)(n-2)/2 = 45.\n\nSo I can set up the equation (n-1)(n-2) = 90. Because 45 times 2 is 90.\n\nNow I need to find n such that (n-1)(n-2) equals 90. Let me think about possible integer values of n.\n\nAlternatively, I can expand this equation. Let me do that.\n\nExpanding (n-1)(n-2) = n\u00b2 -3n +2 =90.\n\nSo, n\u00b2 -3n +2 -90 =0 \u2192 n\u00b2 -3n -88=0.\n\nNow, I can solve this quadratic equation. The quadratic formula is n = [3 \u00b1 sqrt(9 + 352)] / 2, because the equation is n\u00b2 -3n -88 =0. So a=1, b=-3, c=-88.\n\nCalculating the discriminant: sqrt( (\u22123)^2 \u22124*1*(\u221288) ) \u2192 sqrt(9 + 352) = sqrt(361) = 19.\n\nSo n = [3 +19]/2 =22/2=11, or n=[3-19]/2 = (-16)/2 = -8.\n\nBut n can't be negative, so n=11.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Because n=11 would mean the box has balls 1 to 11, so excluding 3, we have 10 balls. So the number of ways to choose 2 from 10 is C(10,2)=45. Yep, that's correct because 10*9/2=45.\n\nSo n must be 11. Looking at the options, option A is 11.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The options include 10, 11, etc. So if the total number of balls is 11, then the number of ways without the 3 is C(10,2)=45, which matches the problem statement.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the correct answer should be 11, which is option A.\n",

Hmm, so I remember that the number of ways to choose two items from a set is given by combinations. The formula for combinations is n choose 2, which is n(n-1)/2.

So the number of ways to choose two balls without including 3 would be C(n-1,2).\n\nWait, let me make sure. If there are n balls and one is excluded, then the remaining is (n-1) balls.

So plugging that in:\n\n(n-1)(n-2)/2 = 45.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 gives:\n\n(n-1)(n-2) = 90.\n\nNow I need to solve for n. Let's expand the left side:\n\nn\u00b2 -3n +2 =90.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me compute (n-1)(n-2). It's n\u00b2 -3n + 2. So:\n\nn\u00b2 -3n +2 =90.\n\nSubtract 90 from both sides:\n\nn\u00b2 -3n -88 =0.\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation: n\u00b2 -3n -88 =0. I can try to factor this, or use the quadratic formula.\n\nLet me see if it factors. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -88 and add up to -3. Hmm. Let's think: factors of 88 are 8 and 11. So 8 and 11. Wait, 8 * (-11) is -88, and 8 + (-11) is -3. Oh right, so yes. So the equation factors as:\n\n(n +8)(n -11)=0.\n\nSo the solutions are n = -8 or n=11. Since n can't be negative, n=11.\n\nSo the answer should be option A)11.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If n is 11, then the number of balls without 3 is 10. So C(10, 2) is 45. Let me compute that: 10*9/2=45. Yes, that's correct. So the answer is 11, which is option A.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the value of \\( n \\) such that there are 45 ways to select two balls from a box containing \\( n \\) balls, with the condition that the ball numbered 3 is not selected. \n\nTo solve this, we recognize that the number of ways to select two balls without including ball 3 is equivalent to choosing two balls from the remaining \\( n-1 \\) balls. The number of such combinations is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nC(n-1, 2) = \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}.\n\\]\n\nAccording to the problem, this equals 45:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} = 45.\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2:\n\n\\[\n(n-1)(n-2) = 90.\n\\]\n\nExpanding and rearranging:\n\n\\[\nn^2 - 3n - 88 = 0.\n\\]\n\nFactoring the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\n(n + 8)(n - 11) = 0.\n\\]\n\nSince \\( n \\) cannot be negative, the solution is \\( n = 11 \\). Verifying, if \\( n = 11 \\), the number of ways to select two balls from the remaining 10 balls is:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 2) = \\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} = 45,\n\\]\n\nwhich matches the given condition. Therefore, the value of \\( n \\) is 11.\n\nAnswer: A",

We need to find n such that there are 45 different ways to select two balls without selecting the ball numbered 3. Hmm.\n\nWait, so the total number of ways to choose two balls without considering any restrictions is C(n,2), right? But here, we're excluding the case where ball 3 is selected. So maybe I should think about how many total pairs there are and subtract the ones that include ball 3.\n\nLet me break it down. The total number of ways to choose two balls is n choose 2, which is n(n-1)/2. But since we can't pick ball 3, the number of valid pairs is the total without any restrictions minus the number of pairs that include ball 3.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem states that the number of ways where ball 3 is not selected is 45. So that's the same as the number of ways to choose two balls from the remaining balls, excluding ball 3. Oh right, because if you can't pick ball 3, you're only selecting from the other (n-1) balls.\n\nSo the formula would be C(n-1,2) = 45. Because we're choosing two balls from n-1 (since ball 3 is excluded).\n\nLet me compute that. C(n-1,2) is (n-1)(n-2)/2 = 45.\n\nSo (n-1)(n-2) = 90. Because 45 * 2 is 90.\n\nNow I need to find n such that (n-1)(n-2) = 90.\n\nLet me think about factors of 90. Let's see:\n\n90 = 9 * 10. Hmm, so if (n-1)=10 and (n-2)=9, then n-1 is 10, so n=11.\n\nWait, let me check: 10 *9 is 90. So yes, (n-1)=10, n=11.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure that I'm not making a mistake here. Because sometimes when you set up the equation, you might have the wrong approach.\n\nAlternative approach: The total number of possible pairs without any restrictions is C(n,2). The number of pairs that include ball 3 is C(n-1,1), because you have to choose one more ball from the remaining (n-1) balls. So the number of pairs without ball 3 is C(n,2) - (n-1).\n\nAnd according to the problem, this equals 45. So the equation is [n(n-1)/2] - (n-1) =45.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nn(n-1)/2 - (n-1) =45.\n\nFactor out (n-1):\n\n(n-1)(n/2 -1) )=45.\n\nHmm, maybe it's easier to compute the first approach. Let me go back. Because in the first approach, I considered that when you exclude ball 3, you're left with (n-1) balls, and choosing two from them is 45. So that gives (n-1)(n-2)/2 =45.\n\nWait, so in this case, (n-1)(n-2) =90. So n-1 and n-2 are consecutive integers whose product is 90. Let's see, 9 and 10.

I need to find the total number of balls, n.\n\nHmm, right. So, the total number of ways to choose two balls from n is given by the combination formula C(n,2), which is n*(n-1)/2. But wait, the problem says that the ball with number 3 isn't selected. So, we need to exclude any selections that include the 3.\n\nWait, but maybe another approach: if the ball 3 isn't selected, then we're choosing two balls from the remaining (n-1) balls. Because the total number of balls is n, and we're excluding one (number 3), so that leaves n-1 balls to choose from.\n\nSo the number of ways to choose two balls without selecting 3 is C(n-1, 2). And this equals 45.\n\nSo the equation is C(n-1, 2) = 45.\n\nLet me write that down. C(n-1, 2) = (n-1)(n-2)/2 = 45.\n\nSo I need to solve for n in that equation.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: (n-1)(n-2) = 90.\n\nExpanding that: n\u00b2 -3n +2 =90.\n\nWait, n squared minus 3n plus 2 equals 90. So moving 90 to the left: n\u00b2 -3n -88 =0.\n\nNow, solving this quadratic equation. The quadratic formula is n = [3 \u00b1 sqrt(9 + 352)] / 2. Because sqrt(b\u00b2-4ac) where a=1, b=-3, c=-88. So discriminant is 9 + 352 = 361. Square root of 361 is 19.\n\nSo n = [3 +19]/2 = 22/2=11, or [3-19]/2= -16/2= -8.\n\nBut n can't be negative, so n=11.\n\nWait, let me check that.

      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. So, the problem is about selecting two balls from a box, but we can't select the one marked with 3. And there are 45 different ways to do this. I need to find the total number of balls, n.\n\nHmm, right. So, the total number of ways to choose two balls from n is given by the combination formula C(n,2), which is n*(n-1)/2. But wait, the problem says that the ball with number 3 isn't selected. So, we need to exclude any selections that include the 3.\n\nWait, but maybe another approach: if the ball 3 isn't selected, then we're choosing two balls from the remaining (n-1) balls. Because the total number of balls is n, and we're excluding one (number 3), so that leaves n-1 balls to choose from.\n\nSo the number of ways to choose two balls without selecting 3 is C(n-1, 2). And this equals 45.\n\nSo the equation is C(n-1, 2) = 45.\n\nLet me write that down. C(n-1, 2) = (n-1)(n-2)/2 = 45.\n\nSo I need to solve for n in that equation.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: (n-1)(n-2) = 90.\n\nExpanding that: n\u00b2 -3n +2 =90.\n\nWait, n squared minus 3n plus 2 equals 90. So moving 90 to the left: n\u00b2 -3n -88 =0.\n\nNow, solving this quadratic equation. The quadratic formula is n = [3 \u00b1 sqrt(9 + 352)] / 2. Because sqrt(b\u00b2-4ac) where a=1, b=-3, c=-88. So discriminant is 9 + 352 = 361. Square root of 361 is 19.\n\nSo n = [3 +19]/2 = 22/2=11, or [3-19]/2= -16/2= -8.\n\nBut n can't be negative, so n=11.\n\nWait, let me check that. So if n is 11, then n-1 is 10. C(10,2) is 10*9/2 =45.

I can't pick the ball with number 3. So the number of balls available for selection is n-1, right?
