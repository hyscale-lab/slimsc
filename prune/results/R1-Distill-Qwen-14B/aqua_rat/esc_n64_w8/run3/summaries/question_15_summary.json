      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about rearranging the letters of the word \"PROBLEM\" to make 7-letter words without any repeating letters. The options are A through E, with factorials from 2! up to 9!. Hmm, let me think about this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem. The word given is \"PROBLEM\". Wait, let me count the letters. P, R, O, B, L, E, M. That's seven letters, right? So it's a 7-letter word. The question is asking how many ways we can rearrange these letters to form 7-letter words where none of the letters repeat. Oh, wait, but since all letters are unique in \"PROBLEM\", any rearrangement would naturally have no repeats, right?\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me make sure. \"PROBLEM\" has P, R, O, B, L, E, M. Are any of these letters repeating? No, each appears once. So the word is made up of seven distinct letters. So when we rearrange them, each arrangement will also be a permutation of these seven unique letters.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the number of permutations of 7 distinct items. The formula for that is 7 factorial, which is 7! So 7! equals 7\u00d76\u00d75\u00d74\u00d73\u00d72\u00d71. Let me compute that quickly. 7\u00d76 is 42, times 5 is 210, times 4 is 840, times 3 is 2520, times 2 is 5040. So 7! is 5040.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is 7! So that should be the correct answer. Let me check the options again: A is 2!, which is 2, way too small. B is 3!, which is 6, still way off. C is 7! as I thought. D is 8! which is 40320, that's way bigger than needed because the word is only 7 letters. E is 9!, which is even larger, so that's definitely wrong.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I read the word correctly? The question says \"PROBLEC\". Oh, wait, the original word in the question is \"PROBLEM\"? Or is it \"PROBLEC\"? Let me check. The user wrote \"PROBLEM\" in the first line. Wait, no, the question says \"the letters of the word 'PROBLEC'\". Oh! Wait, wait, wait. Oh no, I think I made a mistake earlier. The word is \"PROBLEC\", not \"PROBLEM\".\n\nWait, so let me count the letters in \"PROBLEC\". P, R, O, B, L, E, C. That's seven letters again, and each is unique. So the same reasoning applies. So the number of permutations is 7! again. So option C is correct.\n\nWait, but why did I think about \"PROBLEM\" earlier? Oh, maybe I misread the question. The word is definitely \"PROBLEC\". So yeah, 7 letters, each unique. So the number of rearrangements is 7! which is 5040, so option C.\n",
