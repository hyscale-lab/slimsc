      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about tires and costs. Let me try to understand it step by step. Hmm, the question is about calculating the average cost per year for new tires versus repairing the current ones and then finding out what percent greater the new tires are compared to the repair option.\n\nAlright, so when you buy new tires, each costs $180. They last for four years. So, if I buy four tires, the total cost would be 4 times 180, which is $720. But wait, maybe I should think per tire. Oh, wait, no, the problem says the cost is $180 per tire. So, each tire is $180 and lasts four years. So per tire, the cost is $180 over four years.\n\nAlternatively, the customer can repair their current tires for $40 each. Repairing makes the current tires last one more year. So, if the tires were already in use, and they can be repaired once for $40 each, adding one more year. But wait, how long do the tires last originally? The problem says when purchased new, they last for four years. So, the current tires are probably already a few years old. Wait, no, the problem doesn't specify how old they are, but the repair adds one year. So, the original lifespan is four years. So, if the customer repairs, they get an extra year. So, the repaired tires would last five years? Or is it that each repair gives an extra year, but the cost is per tire?\n\nWait, let me read it again. The customer can have his current tires repaired at $40 per tire, which will make them last one additional year. So, perhaps the current tires are already old, and without repair, they wouldn't last much longer. Repairing adds one more year. So, if the customer chooses to repair, each tire is $40, and the lifespan increases by one year.\n\nWait, but the original tires were new for four years. So, if the customer has used them for some time, but I'm not sure. Maybe the problem is considering that the current tires are about to wear out, and without repair, they would last a certain amount of time, but with repair, it's one more year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the customer's current tires are still in use, and without repair, they would last for one more year. So, the repair adds an extra year. So, without repair, the tires last one more year, and with repair, two more years. Or perhaps the repair makes them last for an additional year beyond their original lifespan.\n\nWait, the problem states, \"when purchased new, last for four years.\" So, the new tires last four years. The current tires, which are being repaired, must have been purchased and are now older. So, perhaps the customer's tires are, say, three years old, so they have one year left, and repairing them would add another year, making them last two more years. Or maybe the repair adds one year to their current lifespan.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the current tires are already in use, and without repair, they would last for one more year. So, their remaining lifespan is one year. Repairing them for $40 each would make them last one additional year, so two years total from now.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the problem differently. The problem is about the average cost per year for each option.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Each tire costs $180 and lasts four years. So, the cost per year per tire is 180 divided by 4, which is $45 per year.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires. Each repair costs $40 and extends their life by one year. So, if the tires are already, say, three years old, they have one year left. Repairing adds one more year, making the total lifespan five years? Or perhaps the repair is a one-time cost that adds one more year to the existing lifespan. Wait, the problem says the repair makes them last for one additional year. So, the current tires, without repair, would last for how much longer? I think the problem doesn't specify, but perhaps the current tires are about to fail, so without repair, they have zero years left. Or maybe the current tires have some remaining life.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires have been used for some time, and the customer is deciding whether to repair or replace. But the problem says that the new tires last four years when purchased new. So, the current tires have already been used for some time, but their remaining lifespan without repair is not specified. Hmm, maybe I should consider the average cost per year for each option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Let me think about it as two options:\n\nOption A: Buy new tires. Each tire costs $180 and lasts four years. So, per tire, the cost per year is 180/4 = $45.\n\nOption B: Repair the current tires. Each repair costs $40 per tire and adds one year to their lifespan. So, perhaps the current tires are about to last for one more year without repair. So, by repairing, they last two years. So, the cost per year would be 40 per year for two years. Wait, but the problem says that the repair makes them last for one additional year. So, perhaps the current tires have X years left without repair, and with repair, X+1 years.\n\nBut since the problem says that the new tires last four years, and the current tires are being repaired, perhaps the current tires have already been used for four years and are now at the end of their life. So, without repair, they wouldn't last any longer. But the repair adds one year. So, the total lifespan would be five years? No, that doesn't make sense because the new tires last four years when new.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires have been used for three years, and without repair, they would last one more year. So, with repair, they last two more years. But the problem states that the repair makes them last for one additional year. So, perhaps the current tires, without repair, would have a lifespan of L years, and with repair, it becomes L+1.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the customer can choose to repair each tire once, adding one year to their lifespan. So, if the current tires have been used for, say, three years, they would last one more year without repair. Repairing would make them last two more years. So, the cost of repair is $40 per tire, and the lifespan is extended by one year.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify how many years the current tires have already been used. So, perhaps the problem is considering that the customer's current tires are about to last for one more year without repair. So, the repair adds an extra year, making it two years. So, the cost per tire is $40 for two years, so $20 per year.\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't specify the remaining lifespan, so maybe I should assume that the current tires are about to be replaced, and without repair, they have zero years left, and repair gives them one year. That can't be right because then the average cost would be $40 per year, but let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the current tires are already in use, and without repair, they can be used for one more year. So, the customer's options are:\n\n1. Buy new tires: $180 per tire, lasts four years. So, average cost per year is 180/4 = $45.\n\n2. Repair current tires: $40 per tire, which adds one year. So, the total lifespan becomes one year (without repair) plus one year (with repair) = two years? Or is the repair adding one more year on top of whatever they have left?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the current tires can be used for another year without repair. So, if you repair them, they last for two years. So, for two years, the cost is $40 per tire. So, the average cost per year would be 40 / 2 = $20 per year.\n\nSo, the new tires cost $45 per year, and the repair option costs $20 per year. Now, the question is, the average cost of new tires is what percent greater than the repair option.\n\nSo, the increase is 45 - 20 = $25.\n\nTo find the percentage increase: (25 / 20) * 100% = 125%. But wait, that's not one of the options. Hmm, the options are 8%, 10%, 12.5%, 16.7%, 25%. Wait, 125% is way higher. So, I must have made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nWait, let me reevaluate. Maybe I messed up the average cost per year for the repair option. Let's think again.\n\nIf the customer chooses to repair the current tires, each tire is $40, and the lifespan increases by one year. So, the customer can choose to repair each tire once, adding one year.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer has four tires, each of which can be repaired for $40, adding one year each. So, for each tire, the cost is $40, and the lifespan is increased by one year.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the tires are for a customer, so perhaps the customer has four tires, each of which can be repaired for $40, adding one year to each tire's lifespan.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is considering the cost per tire. Let me try to model this correctly.\n\nOption 1: Buy four new tires. Each costs $180, so total cost is 4 * 180 = $720. Each tire lasts four years. So, total lifespan is four years.\n\nAverage cost per year: 720 / 4 = $180 per year total? Wait, no, because each tire's cost is $180, but perhaps the average cost per tire per year is 180/4 = $45 per tire per year. Or maybe the question is about the total cost per year, but I think the question is per tire.\n\nWait, the question says, \"the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\" So, it's about per tire average cost per year.\n\nSo, for new tires: each tire costs $180 and lasts four years. So, cost per year per tire is 180 / 4 = $45.\n\nFor repair: each tire is repaired for $40, and the lifespan is extended by one year. So, what is the average cost per year for the repair option?\n\nWait, if the current tires have been used for some time, and without repair, they have one year left. So, the customer can choose to repair each tire for $40, which adds one more year, making the total lifespan two years for each tire.\n\nSo, the total cost for the repair option is $40 per tire for two years of use. So, the average cost per year per tire is 40 / 2 = $20.\n\nSo, the new tire's average cost is $45 per year, repair is $20 per year.\n\nThe question is, how much greater is 45 than 20 in percentage terms.\n\nSo, the increase is 45 - 20 = 25.\n\nTo find the percentage: (25 / 20) * 100% = 125%.\n\nBut wait, 125% isn't one of the options. The options are A)8%, B)10%, C)12.5%, D)16.7%, E)25%.\n\nHmm, so I must have made a mistake in my assumptions.\n\nLet me think again. Maybe the current tires are already being used, and the customer is considering whether to replace all four tires now or repair them. But the problem says \"current tires\" and the repair cost is per tire. So, perhaps the customer has four tires, each of which can be repaired for $40, adding one year to each. So, the total cost for repairing all four tires is 4 * 40 = $160, and the lifespan becomes one additional year. So, the original lifespan was four years, but wait, no. Wait, the original tires when new last four years. So, if the current tires are, say, three years old, they have one year left. Repairing them for $40 each adds one more year, so now they last two more years (total of four years from purchase, but the customer is now at year three, and the repair extends to year four and five? I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires have been used for some time, and the customer is deciding whether to repair each tire once, adding one year to each tire's lifespan. So, each tire's cost is $40, and the lifespan is increased by one year.\n\nBut perhaps the average cost per year is calculated as the total cost divided by the total lifespan.\n\nLet me try this approach.\n\nFor the new tires option: total cost is 4 tires * $180 = $720. Lifespan is four years. So, average cost per year is 720 / 4 = $180 per year.\n\nFor the repair option: the customer repairs each of the four tires for $40 each, so total repair cost is 4 * 40 = $160. The repair adds one year to each tire's lifespan. So, what's the total lifespan now?\n\nWait, the original tires when new last four years. If the customer is choosing to repair, perhaps the tires are already older. But without knowing how long they've been used, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the current tires are about to last for one more year without repair. So, by repairing, they get an additional year, making it two years.\n\nSo, total lifespan after repair is 1 + 1 = 2 years. So, the total cost for repair is $160, and the lifespan is 2 years. So, average cost per year is 160 / 2 = $80 per year.\n\nWait, but then the new tires are $180 per year average, and repair is $80 per year. So, the difference is $100. The percentage is (100 / 80) * 100% = 125% again. Which isn't an option.\n\nHmm, maybe I should model this differently. Perhaps the average cost per tire per year is being considered.\n\nSo, for the new tire: $180 for four years. So, 180 /4 = 45 per year.\n\nFor the repair option: Each tire is repaired for $40, adding one year to its lifespan. So, if the original tire would have lasted, say, X years, now it lasts X + 1. But without knowing X, perhaps the problem assumes that the current tires are at the end of their useful life, so without repair, they have zero years left. But that doesn't make sense because you can't get a negative lifespan.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires have been used for three years, and without repair, they have one more year left. So, with repair, they last four years (original four years when new, but already used for three, so one left, but repair adds another year, making it two more years). Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is simpler. Let me think of each option in terms of per tire.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tire. Cost: $180. Lifespan: 4 years. So, cost per year: 180/4 = $45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tire. Cost: $40. Lifespan: 1 additional year. So, if the tire was going to last one more year without repair, now it will last two years. So, cost per year is 40 / (1 + 1) = 20. Or, if the tire is about to fail, and repair gives it one more year, then cost per year is 40 /1 = 40.\n\nBut in that case, the average cost per year for repair would be $40, and new is $45. So, the difference is 5, which is 12.5% increase (5/40 = 0.125, 12.5%).\n\nWait, that's one of the options. Option C is 12.5%.\n\nWait, but this depends on how the lifespan is calculated. If the repair gives the tire an additional year beyond its current lifespan, then the total lifespan for the repair option is 1 year (without repair) plus 1 (with repair) = 2 years. So, cost per year is 40/2 = 20.\n\nBut then, the new tire is 45 per year, repair is 20. 45 is 25 more than 20. 25/20 = 1.25, which is 125%. But that's not an option. So, perhaps the original tire's lifespan without repair is zero, meaning that without repair, the tire is about to fail, and repair gives it one year. So, cost per year would be 40 /1 = 40.\n\nIn that case, new is 45, repair is 40. The difference is 5, which is 5/40 = 0.125, 12.5% increase. That would match option C.\n\nBut why would the original tire's lifespan without repair be zero? That seems odd. It would imply the tire is about to fail, and repair gives it one more year. That's a possible scenario, but the problem states that when purchased new, they last four years. So, perhaps the current tires have been used for three years and have one year left. So, without repair, they last one more year. With repair, they last two more years. So, the cost per year would be 40/2 = 20.\n\nSo, new is 45, repair is 20. 45 is 25 more than 20. 25/20 is 1.25, so 125% increase. But that's not an option. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair cost is per tire, and the customer can choose to repair each of the four tires, thereby extending their lifespan by one year each. So, the customer currently has four tires, each of which can be repaired for $40, adding one year to each tire's lifespan.\n\nBut what is the current lifespan left? Without repair, each tire would last one more year. So, with repair, each tire lasts two more years.\n\nSo, the total cost for repair is 4 * 40 = $160. The total lifespan added is four years (one per tire, but wait, no, each tire's lifespan is extended by one year, so the total lifespan for all four tires is increased by four years? Or perhaps per tire, the lifespan is extended by one year.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this for one tire. Let's say the customer has one tire. Without repair, it will last one more year. Repairing it for $40 makes it last two years. So, the cost per year is 40 / 2 = 20.\n\nSo, for one tire, the new option is $180 for four years (cost per year 45). The repair option is $40 for two years (cost per year 20). So, 45 vs 20. 45 is 25 more than 20. 25/20 is 1.25, so 125% increase. But the options don't have that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer is considering replacing all four tires at once, and the repair option is to repair all four tires for $40 each, adding one year to each. So, the total repair cost is 4 * 40 = 160. The total lifespan for each tire is increased by one year, making each tire last five years? Or perhaps the original tires were four years old, and without repair, they would last one more year. So, with repair, they last five years.\n\nWait, no. The problem states that when purchased new, the tires last four years. So, if the current tires are, say, three years old, without repair, they have one year left. Repairing them would add one more year, making them last two years beyond their current age. So, total lifespan of four years (original) plus one year (repair) = five years? No, that doesn't make sense. Because when purchased, they last four years. So, if they're three years old, they have one year left. Repairing adds one more year, making two years left.\n\nSo, the total lifespan would be four years (from purchase) plus one year (repair) = five years? Or is the repair adding to the remaining lifespan.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the customer's tires are about to fail, so without repair, they have zero years left. Repairing gives them one year. So, the cost per year is 40 /1 =40.\n\nIn that case, the new tire is 45, repair is 40. The increase is 5, which is 12.5% of 40. So, the answer would be C)12.5%.\n\nBut earlier I thought that perhaps the current tires have one year left, and repair adds another year, making two. So, cost per year is 20. Then, new is 45, which is 125% higher. But that's not an option. So, perhaps the correct assumption is that the current tires have zero years left, and repair gives one year.\n\nBut the problem states that when purchased new, they last four years. So, the current tires are not new, but perhaps they are old enough that without repair, they have one year left.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the customer is considering replacing the tires now or repairing them for one more year. So, for the repair option, the customer can extend the current tires' life by one year, at a cost of $40 per tire.\n\nSo, for each tire, the cost is $40, and the lifespan is increased by one year. So, the average cost per year would be 40 divided by (current remaining lifespan + 1). But without knowing the current remaining lifespan, perhaps the problem is making a different assumption.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering that the customer will have to replace the tires after four years, but by repairing, they can delay that. So, perhaps the average cost per year is calculated over the four years.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer is considering whether to buy new tires now or repair them for an extra year. So, let's model the two options:\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires now. Cost: $180 per tire. Lifespan: four years. So, average cost per year: 180 /4 = $45.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires for $40 each, which adds one year to their lifespan. So, the customer can choose to repair each tire once, adding one year. So, the total cost for repair is 40 per tire. The lifespan becomes (current lifespan +1). But without knowing the current lifespan, perhaps the problem assumes that the current tires have been used for three years and have one year left. So, repairing adds one year, making the total lifespan four years (from the repair), but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the customer has four tires, each of which can be repaired once for $40, adding one year to their lifespan. So, the total cost is 4 *40 = $160. The total lifespan for all tires becomes (4 years + 4 years) ? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the cost per tire per year for each option.\n\nSo, for new tires: 180/4 = 45 per year.\n\nFor repair: 40 per tire, which adds one year. So, the cost per year is 40 /1 = 40, assuming the repair gives one year of use.\n\nWait, that would make the new tires 45, repair 40. So, the difference is 5. 5/40 = 0.125, which is 12.5% increase. So, the answer is C)12.5%.\n\nBut why would the repair add only one year? Because the problem says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So, without repair, they would last a certain amount of time, but with repair, it's that plus one.\n\nBut without knowing their current lifespan, perhaps the problem is considering that the repair adds one year beyond the original four, making it five years. But that doesn't make sense because the original is four years when new. So, perhaps the current tires are used, and repair adds one more year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the customer is considering the cost for the next four years. If they buy new tires now, they have four years. If they repair, they get one more year, but then have to replace after that. So, the repair option might involve more costs in the future.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the average cost over the four years, and the repair option is an alternative.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer has tires that are about to fail (zero years left). So, repair gives one year. So, the repair cost is $40 for one year of use. The new tire is $180 for four years.\n\nSo, the average cost per year for repair is 40/1 =40. For new, 180/4=45. So, 45 is 5 more than 40. 5/40=0.125=12.5%. So, the answer is C)12.5%.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if this is the correct interpretation. Another way to think about it: when purchasing new, they last four years. If you repair, you can extend their life by one year. So, the repair adds one year to the original four, making it five years. So, the cost per tire would be 180/5=36 per year. But that's not the case because the repair is a separate cost. Wait, no. The new tire is a separate option. The repair is for the current tires, which are not new.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the customer has four tires that are about to wear out. So, they can either buy four new tires at 180 each, which will last four years, or repair each of the four tires for 40 each, making each last one more year (so, total of five years? Or one more year beyond their current lifespan).\n\nBut this is getting too confusing. I think the correct approach is to assume that the repair adds one year to the current tires' lifespan, and the average cost per year is calculated accordingly.\n\nSo, if the current tires without repair would last for one more year, then the repair adds one year, making it two years. So, the cost per year is 40 /2 =20. New tires are 45 per year. The difference is 25, which is 125% of 20. Not an option.\n\nAlternatively, if the repair adds one year beyond the original four, making it five years. So, the cost per year would be 180 /5 =36. But then the repair cost is 40, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the current tires have been used for three years, and without repair, they would last one more year. Repairing adds one more year, making the total lifespan four years (from purchase). So, the average cost per year would be 40 / (1+1) =20. So, new is 45, repair is 20. 45 is 25 more, which is 125% higher. Not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires have been used for three years, so they have one year left. Repairing adds one more year, making it two years beyond the current usage. So, the total lifespan is four years (from purchase) plus one year (repair) = five years. Wait, but the original tires were supposed to last four years when new. So, if they've been used for three, they have one left. Repairing adds one, making it two. So, the total lifespan is four years (original) plus one year (repair) = five years? Or perhaps the repair adds one year to the remaining lifespan.\n\nSo, the cost for repair is $40, and the lifespan is two years. So, cost per year is 40/2=20.\n\nNew tires are 45 per year. 45 is 25 more than 20, which is 125% increase. Not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair cost is per tire, and the customer can choose to repair each tire, adding one year to each, but the customer has four tires. So, the total repair cost is 4*40=160, and the total lifespan is increased by four years (one per tire). So, the new total lifespan is four (original) + four (repair) = eight years. So, average cost per year is 160 /8=20. New tires cost 720 (4*180) over four years, so 180 per year. 180 vs 20. 180 is 160 more, which is 800% increase, which isn't an option.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about the cost per year for each option when considering the same period. For example, considering a four-year period.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Cost: 4*180=720. Lifespan: four years. So, average cost per year: 720/4=180.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires. Each repair is $40, adding one year. So, to cover four years, how many repairs are needed?\n\nWait, if the customer repairs the tires each year, adding one year each time, but that would be a different scenario. Alternatively, perhaps the customer can repair the tires once, adding one year, so the total lifespan is five years. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer can choose to repair the tires once, making them last one additional year beyond their original four, so five years. So, the cost for repair is 4*40=160, and the lifespan is five years. So, average cost per year is 160/5=32. New tires are 180 per year. So, 180 vs 32. 180 is 148 higher. 148/32=4.625, which is 462.5% increase. Not an option.\n\nThis isn't working. Maybe I should look for the correct approach.\n\nAnother approach: Let's compute the average cost per year for each option.\n\nNew tires:\n\nEach tire costs $180 and lasts four years. So, cost per year is 180/4 = $45.\n\nRepair option:\n\nEach repair costs $40 and adds one year to the tire's lifespan. So, if the current tire has been used for t years, it has (4 - t) years left without repair. With repair, it has (4 - t +1) years.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify how old the tires are, perhaps the repair is intended to be done once, adding one year to the tire's lifespan. So, the total lifespan becomes (current age +1). But without knowing the current age, perhaps the problem is assuming that the current tires are about to fail, so without repair, they have zero years left. Repairing gives them one year. So, cost per year is 40/1=40.\n\nSo, new tires are 45, repair is 40. The percentage increase is (45-40)/40 *100% = 12.5%. So, the answer is C.\n\nBut wait, why would the current tires have zero years left? Because they were purchased four years ago, so they are at the end of their lifespan. So, without repair, they would last zero more years. Repairing them gives one more year.\n\nSo, that makes sense. So, the repair option gives one year of use for $40 per tire. So, the average cost per year is 40/1=40. New tires are 45. So, 45 is 12.5% higher than 40.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C)12.5%.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about tires and costs. Let me try to understand it step by step. Hmm, the question is about calculating the average cost per year for new tires versus repairing the current ones and then finding out what percent greater the new tires are compared to the repair option.\n\nAlright, so when you buy new tires, each costs $180. They last for four years. So, if I buy four tires, the total cost would be 4 times 180, which is $720. But wait, maybe I should think per tire. Oh, wait, no, the problem says the cost is $180 per tire. So, each tire is $180 and lasts four years. So per tire, the cost is $180 over four years.\n\nAlternatively, the customer can repair their current tires for $40 each. Repairing makes the current tires last one more year. So, if the tires were already in use, and they can be repaired once for $40 each, adding one more year. But wait, how long do the tires last originally? The problem says when purchased new, they last for four years. So, the current tires are probably already a few years old. Wait, no, the problem doesn't specify how old they are, but the repair adds one year. So, the original lifespan is four years. So, if the customer repairs, they get an extra year. So, the repaired tires would last five years? Or is it that each repair gives an extra year, but the cost is per tire?\n\nWait, let me read it again. The customer can have his current tires repaired at $40 per tire, which will make them last one additional year. So, perhaps the current tires are already old, and without repair, they wouldn't last much longer. Repairing adds one more year. So, if the customer chooses to repair, each tire is $40, and the lifespan increases by one year.\n\nWait, but the original tires were new for four years. So, if the customer has used them for some time, but I'm not sure. Maybe the problem is considering that the current tires are about to wear out, and without repair, they would last a certain amount of time, but with repair, it's one more year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the customer's current tires are still in use, and without repair, they would last for one more year. So, the repair adds an extra year. So, without repair, the tires last one more year, and with repair, two more years. Or perhaps the repair makes them last for an additional year beyond their original lifespan.\n\nWait, the problem states, \"when purchased new, last for four years.\" So, the new tires last four years. The current tires, which are being repaired, must have been purchased and are now older. So, perhaps the customer's tires are, say, three years old, so they have one year left, and repairing them would add another year, making them last two more years. Or maybe the repair adds one year to their current lifespan.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the current tires are already in use, and without repair, they would last for one more year. So, their remaining lifespan is one year. Repairing them for $40 each would make them last one additional year, so two years total from now.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the problem differently. The problem is about the average cost per year for each option.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Each tire costs $180 and lasts four years. So, the cost per year per tire is 180 divided by 4, which is $45 per year.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires. Each repair costs $40 and extends their life by one year. So, if the tires are already, say, three years old, they have one year left. Repairing adds one more year, making the total lifespan five years? Or perhaps the repair is a one-time cost that adds one more year to the existing lifespan. Wait, the problem says the repair makes them last for one additional year. So, the current tires, without repair, would last for how much longer? I think the problem doesn't specify, but perhaps the current tires are about to fail, so without repair, they have zero years left. Or maybe the current tires have some remaining life.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires have been used for some time, and the customer is deciding whether to repair or replace. But the problem says that the new tires last four years when purchased new. So, the current tires have already been used for some time, but their remaining lifespan without repair is not specified. Hmm, maybe I should consider the average cost per year for each option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Let me think about it as two options:\n\nOption A: Buy new tires. Each tire costs $180 and lasts four years. So, per tire, the cost per year is 180/4 = $45.\n\nOption B: Repair the current tires. Each repair costs $40 per tire and adds one year to their lifespan. So, perhaps the current tires are about to last for one more year without repair. So, by repairing, they last two years. So, the cost per year would be 40 per year for two years. Wait, but the problem says that the repair makes them last for one additional year. So, perhaps the current tires have X years left without repair, and with repair, X+1 years.\n\nBut since the problem says that the new tires last four years, and the current tires are being repaired, perhaps the current tires have already been used for four years and are now at the end of their life. So, without repair, they wouldn't last any longer. But the repair adds one year. So, the total lifespan would be five years? No, that doesn't make sense because the new tires last four years when new.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires have been used for three years, and without repair, they would last one more year. So, with repair, they last two more years. But the problem states that the repair makes them last for one additional year. So, perhaps the current tires, without repair, would have a lifespan of L years, and with repair, it becomes L+1.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the customer can choose to repair each tire once, adding one year to their lifespan. So, if the current tires have been used for, say, three years, they would last one more year without repair. Repairing would make them last two more years. So, the cost of repair is $40 per tire, and the lifespan is extended by one year.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify how many years the current tires have already been used. So, perhaps the problem is considering that the customer's current tires are about to last for one more year without repair. So, the repair adds an extra year, making it two years. So, the cost per tire is $40 for two years, so $20 per year.\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't specify the remaining lifespan, so maybe I should assume that the current tires are about to be replaced, and without repair, they have zero years left, and repair gives them one year. That can't be right because then the average cost would be $40 per year, but let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the current tires are already in use, and without repair, they can be used for one more year. So, the customer's options are:\n\n1. Buy new tires: $180 per tire, lasts four years. So, average cost per year is 180/4 = $45.\n\n2. Repair current tires: $40 per tire, which adds one year. So, the total lifespan becomes one year (without repair) plus one year (with repair) = two years? Or is the repair adding one more year on top of whatever they have left?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the current tires can be used for another year without repair. So, if you repair them, they last for two years. So, for two years, the cost is $40 per tire. So, the average cost per year would be 40 / 2 = $20 per year.\n\nSo, the new tires cost $45 per year, and the repair option costs $20 per year. Now, the question is, the average cost of new tires is what percent greater than the repair option.\n\nSo, the increase is 45 - 20 = $25.\n\nTo find the percentage increase: (25 / 20) * 100% = 125%. But wait, that's not one of the options. Hmm, the options are 8%, 10%, 12.5%, 16.7%, 25%. Wait, 125% is way higher. So, I must have made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nWait, let me reevaluate. Maybe I messed up the average cost per year for the repair option. Let's think again.\n\nIf the customer chooses to repair the current tires, each tire is $40, and the lifespan increases by one year. So, the customer can choose to repair each tire once, adding one year.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer has four tires, each of which can be repaired for $40, adding one year each. So, for each tire, the cost is $40, and the lifespan is increased by one year.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the tires are for a customer, so perhaps the customer has four tires, each of which can be repaired for $40, adding one year to each tire's lifespan.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is considering the cost per tire. Let me try to model this correctly.\n\nOption 1: Buy four new tires. Each costs $180, so total cost is 4 * 180 = $720. Each tire lasts four years. So, total lifespan is four years.\n\nAverage cost per year: 720 / 4 = $180 per year total? Wait, no, because each tire's cost is $180, but perhaps the average cost per tire per year is 180/4 = $45 per tire per year. Or maybe the question is about the total cost per year, but I think the question is per tire.\n\nWait, the question says, \"the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\" So, it's about per tire average cost per year.\n\nSo, for new tires: each tire costs $180 and lasts four years. So, cost per year per tire is 180 / 4 = $45.\n\nFor repair: each tire is repaired for $40, and the lifespan is extended by one year. So, what is the average cost per year for the repair option?\n\nWait, if the current tires have been used for some time, and without repair, they have one year left. So, the customer can choose to repair each tire for $40, which adds one more year, making the total lifespan two years for each tire.\n\nSo, the total cost for the repair option is $40 per tire for two years of use. So, the average cost per year per tire is 40 / 2 = $20.\n\nSo, the new tire's average cost is $45 per year, repair is $20 per year.\n\nThe question is, how much greater is 45 than 20 in percentage terms.\n\nSo, the increase is 45 - 20 = 25.\n\nTo find the percentage: (25 / 20) * 100% = 125%.\n\nBut wait, 125% isn't one of the options. The options are A)8%, B)10%, C)12.5%, D)16.7%, E)25%.\n\nHmm, so I must have made a mistake in my assumptions.\n\nLet me think again. Maybe the current tires are already being used, and the customer is considering whether to replace all four tires now or repair them. But the problem says \"current tires\" and the repair cost is per tire. So, perhaps the customer has four tires, each of which can be repaired for $40, adding one year to each. So, the total cost for repairing all four tires is 4 * 40 = $160, and the lifespan becomes one additional year. So, the original lifespan was four years, but wait, no. Wait, the original tires when new last four years. So, if the current tires are, say, three years old, they have one year left. Repairing them for $40 each adds one more year, so now they last two more years (total of four years from purchase, but the customer is now at year three, and the repair extends to year four and five? I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires have been used for some time, and the customer is deciding whether to repair each tire once, adding one year to each tire's lifespan. So, each tire's cost is $40, and the lifespan is increased by one year.\n\nBut perhaps the average cost per year is calculated as the total cost divided by the total lifespan.\n\nLet me try this approach.\n\nFor the new tires option: total cost is 4 tires * $180 = $720. Lifespan is four years. So, average cost per year is 720 / 4 = $180 per year.\n\nFor the repair option: the customer repairs each of the four tires for $40 each, so total repair cost is 4 * 40 = $160. The repair adds one year to each tire's lifespan. So, what's the total lifespan now?\n\nWait, the original tires when new last four years. If the customer is choosing to repair, perhaps the tires are already older. But without knowing how long they've been used, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the current tires are about to last for one more year without repair. So, by repairing, they get an additional year, making it two years.\n\nSo, total lifespan after repair is 1 + 1 = 2 years. So, the total cost for repair is $160, and the lifespan is 2 years. So, average cost per year is 160 / 2 = $80 per year.\n\nWait, but then the new tires are $180 per year average, and repair is $80 per year. So, the difference is $100. The percentage is (100 / 80) * 100% = 125% again. Which isn't an option.\n\nHmm, maybe I should model this differently. Perhaps the average cost per tire per year is being considered.\n\nSo, for the new tire: $180 for four years. So, 180 /4 = 45 per year.\n\nFor the repair option: Each tire is repaired for $40, adding one year to its lifespan. So, if the original tire would have lasted, say, X years, now it lasts X + 1. But without knowing X, perhaps the problem assumes that the current tires are at the end of their useful life, so without repair, they have zero years left. But that doesn't make sense because you can't get a negative lifespan.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires have been used for three years, and without repair, they have one more year left. So, with repair, they last four years (original four years when new, but already used for three, so one left, but repair adds another year, making it two more years). Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is simpler. Let me think of each option in terms of per tire.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tire. Cost: $180. Lifespan: 4 years. So, cost per year: 180/4 = $45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tire. Cost: $40. Lifespan: 1 additional year. So, if the tire was going to last one more year without repair, now it will last two years. So, cost per year is 40 / (1 + 1) = 20. Or, if the tire is about to fail, and repair gives it one more year, then cost per year is 40 /1 = 40.\n\nBut in that case, the average cost per year for repair would be $40, and new is $45. So, the difference is 5, which is 12.5% increase (5/40 = 0.125, 12.5%).\n\nWait, that's one of the options. Option C is 12.5%.\n\nWait, but this depends on how the lifespan is calculated. If the repair gives the tire an additional year beyond its current lifespan, then the total lifespan for the repair option is 1 year (without repair) plus 1 (with repair) = 2 years. So, cost per year is 40/2 = 20.\n\nBut then, the new tire is 45 per year, repair is 20. 45 is 25 more than 20. 25/20 = 1.25, which is 125%. But that's not an option. So, perhaps the original tire's lifespan without repair is zero, meaning that without repair, the tire is about to fail, and repair gives it one year. So, cost per year would be 40 /1 = 40.\n\nIn that case, new is 45, repair is 40. The difference is 5, which is 5/40 = 0.125, 12.5% increase. That would match option C.\n\nBut why would the original tire's lifespan without repair be zero? That seems odd. It would imply the tire is about to fail, and repair gives it one more year. That's a possible scenario, but the problem states that when purchased new, they last four years. So, perhaps the current tires have been used for three years and have one year left. So, without repair, they last one more year. With repair, they last two more years. So, the cost per year would be 40/2 = 20.\n\nSo, new is 45, repair is 20. 45 is 25 more than 20. 25/20 is 1.25, so 125% increase. But that's not an option. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair cost is per tire, and the customer can choose to repair each of the four tires, thereby extending their lifespan by one year each. So, the customer currently has four tires, each of which can be repaired for $40, adding one year to each tire's lifespan.\n\nBut what is the current lifespan left? Without repair, each tire would last one more year. So, with repair, each tire lasts two more years.\n\nSo, the total cost for repair is 4 * 40 = $160. The total lifespan added is four years (one per tire, but wait, no, each tire's lifespan is extended by one year, so the total lifespan for all four tires is increased by four years? Or perhaps per tire, the lifespan is extended by one year.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this for one tire. Let's say the customer has one tire. Without repair, it will last one more year. Repairing it for $40 makes it last two years. So, the cost per year is 40 / 2 = 20.\n\nSo, for one tire, the new option is $180 for four years (cost per year 45). The repair option is $40 for two years (cost per year 20). So, 45 vs 20. 45 is 25 more than 20. 25/20 is 1.25, so 125% increase. But the options don't have that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer is considering replacing all four tires at once, and the repair option is to repair all four tires for $40 each, adding one year to each. So, the total repair cost is 4 * 40 = 160. The total lifespan for each tire is increased by one year, making each tire last five years? Or perhaps the original tires were four years old, and without repair, they would last one more year. So, with repair, they last five years.\n\nWait, no. The problem states that when purchased new, the tires last four years. So, if the current tires are, say, three years old, without repair, they have one year left. Repairing them would add one more year, making them last two years beyond their current age. So, total lifespan of four years (original) plus one year (repair) = five years? No, that doesn't make sense. Because when purchased, they last four years. So, if they're three years old, they have one year left. Repairing adds one more year, making two years left.\n\nSo, the total lifespan would be four years (from purchase) plus one year (repair) = five years? Or is the repair adding to the remaining lifespan.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the customer's tires are about to fail, so without repair, they have zero years left. Repairing gives them one year. So, the cost per year is 40 /1 =40.\n\nIn that case, the new tire is 45, repair is 40. The increase is 5, which is 12.5% of 40. So, the answer would be C)12.5%.\n\nBut earlier I thought that perhaps the current tires have one year left, and repair adds another year, making two. So, cost per year is 20. Then, new is 45, which is 125% higher. But that's not an option. So, perhaps the correct assumption is that the current tires have zero years left, and repair gives one year.\n\nBut the problem states that when purchased new, they last four years. So, the current tires are not new, but perhaps they are old enough that without repair, they have one year left.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the customer is considering replacing the tires now or repairing them for one more year. So, for the repair option, the customer can extend the current tires' life by one year, at a cost of $40 per tire.\n\nSo, for each tire, the cost is $40, and the lifespan is increased by one year. So, the average cost per year would be 40 divided by (current remaining lifespan + 1). But without knowing the current remaining lifespan, perhaps the problem is making a different assumption.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering that the customer will have to replace the tires after four years, but by repairing, they can delay that. So, perhaps the average cost per year is calculated over the four years.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer is considering whether to buy new tires now or repair them for an extra year. So, let's model the two options:\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires now. Cost: $180 per tire. Lifespan: four years. So, average cost per year: 180 /4 = $45.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires for $40 each, which adds one year to their lifespan. So, the customer can choose to repair each tire once, adding one year. So, the total cost for repair is 40 per tire. The lifespan becomes (current lifespan +1). But without knowing the current lifespan, perhaps the problem assumes that the current tires have been used for three years and have one year left. So, repairing adds one year, making the total lifespan four years (from the repair), but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the customer has four tires, each of which can be repaired once for $40, adding one year to their lifespan. So, the total cost is 4 *40 = $160. The total lifespan for all tires becomes (4 years + 4 years) ? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the cost per tire per year for each option.\n\nSo, for new tires: 180/4 = 45 per year.\n\nFor repair: 40 per tire, which adds one year. So, the cost per year is 40 /1 = 40, assuming the repair gives one year of use.\n\nWait, that would make the new tires 45, repair 40. So, the difference is 5. 5/40 = 0.125, which is 12.5% increase. So, the answer is C)12.5%.\n\nBut why would the repair add only one year? Because the problem says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So, without repair, they would last a certain amount of time, but with repair, it's that plus one.\n\nBut without knowing their current lifespan, perhaps the problem is considering that the repair adds one year beyond the original four, making it five years. But that doesn't make sense because the original is four years when new. So, perhaps the current tires are used, and repair adds one more year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the customer is considering the cost for the next four years. If they buy new tires now, they have four years. If they repair, they get one more year, but then have to replace after that. So, the repair option might involve more costs in the future.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the average cost over the four years, and the repair option is an alternative.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer has tires that are about to fail (zero years left). So, repair gives one year. So, the repair cost is $40 for one year of use. The new tire is $180 for four years.\n\nSo, the average cost per year for repair is 40/1 =40. For new, 180/4=45. So, 45 is 5 more than 40. 5/40=0.125=12.5%. So, the answer is C)12.5%.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if this is the correct interpretation. Another way to think about it: when purchasing new, they last four years. If you repair, you can extend their life by one year. So, the repair adds one year to the original four, making it five years. So, the cost per tire would be 180/5=36 per year. But that's not the case because the repair is a separate cost. Wait, no. The new tire is a separate option. The repair is for the current tires, which are not new.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the customer has four tires that are about to wear out. So, they can either buy four new tires at 180 each, which will last four years, or repair each of the four tires for 40 each, making each last one more year (so, total of five years? Or one more year beyond their current lifespan).\n\nBut this is getting too confusing. I think the correct approach is to assume that the repair adds one year to the current tires' lifespan, and the average cost per year is calculated accordingly.\n\nSo, if the current tires without repair would last for one more year, then the repair adds one year, making it two years. So, the cost per year is 40 /2 =20. New tires are 45 per year. The difference is 25, which is 125% of 20. Not an option.\n\nAlternatively, if the repair adds one year beyond the original four, making it five years. So, the cost per year would be 180 /5 =36. But then the repair cost is 40, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the current tires have been used for three years, and without repair, they would last one more year. Repairing adds one more year, making the total lifespan four years (from purchase). So, the average cost per year would be 40 / (1+1) =20. So, new is 45, repair is 20. 45 is 25 more, which is 125% higher. Not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires have been used for three years, so they have one year left. Repairing adds one more year, making it two years beyond the current usage. So, the total lifespan is four years (from purchase) plus one year (repair) = five years. Wait, but the original tires were supposed to last four years when new. So, if they've been used for three, they have one left. Repairing adds one, making it two. So, the total lifespan is four years (original) plus one year (repair) = five years? Or perhaps the repair adds one year to the remaining lifespan.\n\nSo, the cost for repair is $40, and the lifespan is two years. So, cost per year is 40/2=20.\n\nNew tires are 45 per year. 45 is 25 more than 20, which is 125% increase. Not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair cost is per tire, and the customer can choose to repair each tire, adding one year to each, but the customer has four tires. So, the total repair cost is 4*40=160, and the total lifespan is increased by four years (one per tire). So, the new total lifespan is four (original) + four (repair) = eight years. So, average cost per year is 160 /8=20. New tires cost 720 (4*180) over four years, so 180 per year. 180 vs 20. 180 is 160 more, which is 800% increase, which isn't an option.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about the cost per year for each option when considering the same period. For example, considering a four-year period.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Cost: 4*180=720. Lifespan: four years. So, average cost per year: 720/4=180.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires. Each repair is $40, adding one year. So, to cover four years, how many repairs are needed?\n\nWait, if the customer repairs the tires each year, adding one year each time, but that would be a different scenario. Alternatively, perhaps the customer can repair the tires once, adding one year, so the total lifespan is five years. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer can choose to repair the tires once, making them last one additional year beyond their original four, so five years. So, the cost for repair is 4*40=160, and the lifespan is five years. So, average cost per year is 160/5=32. New tires are 180 per year. So, 180 vs 32. 180 is 148 higher. 148/32=4.625, which is 462.5% increase. Not an option.\n\nThis isn't working. Maybe I should look for the correct approach.\n\nAnother approach: Let's compute the average cost per year for each option.\n\nNew tires:\n\nEach tire costs $180 and lasts four years. So, cost per year is 180/4 = $45.\n\nRepair option:\n\nEach repair costs $40 and adds one year to the tire's lifespan. So, if the current tire has been used for t years, it has (4 - t) years left without repair. With repair, it has (4 - t +1) years.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify how old the tires are, perhaps the repair is intended to be done once, adding one year to the tire's lifespan. So, the total lifespan becomes (current age +1). But without knowing the current age, perhaps the problem is assuming that the current tires are about to fail, so without repair, they have zero years left. Repairing gives them one year. So, cost per year is 40/1=40.\n\nSo, new tires are 45, repair is 40. The percentage increase is (45-40)/40 *100% = 12.5%. So, the answer is C.\n\nBut wait, why would the current tires have zero years left? Because they were purchased four years ago, so they are at the end of their lifespan. So, without repair, they would last zero more years. Repairing them gives one more year.\n\nSo, that makes sense. So, the repair option gives one year of use for $40 per tire. So, the average cost per year is 40/1=40. New tires are 45. So, 45 is 12.5% higher than 40.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C)12.5%.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage by which the average cost per year of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires, we analyze both options:\n\n### Option 1: New Tires\n- **Cost per tire**: $180  \n- **Lifespan**: 4 years  \n- **Average cost per year per tire**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{180}{4} = 45 \\, \\text{dollars/year}\n  \\]\n\n### Option 2: Repairing Current Tires\n- **Cost per tire**: $40  \n- **Additional lifespan**: 1 year  \n- **Assumption**: The current tires are at the end of their useful life (no remaining lifespan without repair). Repairing them gives them 1 additional year of use.  \n- **Average cost per year per tire**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{40}{1} = 40 \\, \\text{dollars/year}\n  \\]\n\n### Percentage Increase\nThe question asks for the percentage by which the average cost of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires. The difference in cost per year is:  \n\\[\n45 - 40 = 5 \\, \\text{dollars}\n\\]  \nThe percentage increase is calculated as:  \n\\[\n\\frac{5}{40} \\times 100\\% = 12.5\\%\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe average cost per year of new tires is **12.5% greater** than the cost of repairing the current tires.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about comparing the average cost per year for new tires versus repairing the current ones. Hmm.\n\nAlright, let me read it again. The tires, when new, last for four years and cost $180 each. The customer can either buy new tires for $180 each or repair the current ones for $40 each, which extends their life by one year. So the repair makes the current tires last for one more year. \n\nWait, so the current tires are already in use, and if you repair them, they'll last an extra year. So if they were going to last four years when new, maybe the current ones have been used for some time? Or does the repair just add one year regardless of their current condition? Hmm, the question says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So whether they've been used for a month or three years, the repair adds one more year.\n\nSo, let's break it down. For each tire, there are two options:\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires for $180. They last four years. So the total cost is $180, and they give four years of use.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires for $40. This extends their life by one year. So if the tires were going to last, say, X years, now they last X+1 years. Wait, but wait, the original problem says when purchased new, they last four years. So perhaps the current tires have already been in use for a certain period, but the question doesn't specify how long. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the customer currently has tires that are, say, three years old. If they repair them, they get one more year (so total four years from when they were new). Or perhaps the current tires have been used for a year, and repairing them adds one more year, making them last two years total? I'm not sure. Wait, the question doesn't specify how long the current tires have been in use. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me reread the problem.\n\nThe problem says: tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years. So that's the lifespan of the new tires. The customer can choose between purchasing new tires at $180 each or repairing their current tires for $40 each, which makes the current tires last one additional year. So the repair adds one year to the current tires' lifespan.\n\nWait, but how much life do the current tires have left? The problem doesn't specify. Hmm, maybe the customer is considering whether to repair their current tires or replace them. But without knowing how much life the current tires have left, how can we compare?\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are about to fail or are at a point where repair is needed. Maybe the customer is facing a choice: repair now for $40 and get one more year, or replace now for $180 and get four years.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Let's assume that the current tires have already been used for three years. So, without repair, they would last one more year (total four years). But if the customer repairs them, they add one more year, making them last five years? Wait, that doesn't fit the question. The question says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So perhaps the current tires, without repair, would last for three years, and repair makes them last four. Or maybe the current tires have been used for some time, but the repair adds one more year, regardless of how much time they have left.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires are about to need replacement, so they have zero life left. So the repair makes them last one year. Hmm, but that seems odd.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is structured so that the current tires have a remaining life. For example, if the customer chooses to repair, they pay $40, and the tires last one more year. So, if the tires were going to last two more years, the repair would make it three. But without knowing their current remaining life, I'm stuck.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the customer's current tires are already one year old. So when new, they last four years. So after one year, they have three years left. If the customer repairs them for $40, they add one more year, making them last four years from the current time, which would be five years from when they were new. Hmm, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair adds one year to the current tires, regardless of how old they are. So, if the customer has a tire that's two years old, and they repair it, it will last for three more years (since two years have passed, plus one more year from repair). Or maybe the repair doesn't depend on the current age, just adds one year.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the repair adds one more year of life to the current tires, regardless of how much life they have left. So the total lifespan becomes current life +1.\n\nBut since the question is about average cost per year, perhaps we can model it as:\n\nFor the new tires: $180 cost, 4-year lifespan. So the average cost per year is 180 /4.\n\nFor the repair: $40 cost, which extends the current tires by one year. So, the current tires' lifespan is, say, x years, and with repair, it's x+1. But without knowing x, how do we compute the average cost per year?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the current tires have already been used for a certain period, say, y years, and the repair adds one more year. So the total lifespan is y+1 years, and the cost is $40.\n\nBut the problem doesn't give the current age of the tires. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to be that the customer is considering whether to repair the current tires or buy new ones, and the current tires have already been in use for three years. So without repair, they would last one more year (total four), and with repair, they would last two more years (total five). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the customer is choosing between buying new tires now, which will last four years, or repairing the current tires for $40, which will make them last one more year (so the current tires would last one year longer than they otherwise would). So, the average cost per year for each option can be calculated.\n\nWait, let's think about the average cost per year.\n\nFor the new tires: cost is $180, lifespan is 4 years. So average cost per year is 180/4 = $45 per year.\n\nFor the repair: cost is $40, and lifespan is increased by 1 year. But how much total lifespan do the current tires have?\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires have been in use for some time. Let me think: perhaps the current tires have already been used for three years, so without repair, they would last one more year (total four). If repaired, they last two more years (total five). So the total lifespan with repair is 3 + 2 = 5 years? Or is it 4 + 1 = 5 years? Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the current tires are in their fourth year, and without repair, they would last one more year, making four years total. If repaired, they'll last one additional year beyond that, so five years total.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the current tires have been used for some time, but the problem isn't clear. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is structured such that the current tires are about to fail (so no remaining life), and repairing them adds one year. So the cost is $40 for one year of use. But that can't be right because that would make the average cost per year $40, which is higher than the new tires' $45, but the question asks which is higher.\n\nWait, but the question says the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing. So the new tires have higher cost per year, and we're to find the percentage increase.\n\nWait, but in the options, the highest percentage is 25%, so perhaps the average cost per year for new tires is 45, and for repair it's 40, but that would make the new tires only 12.5% higher. Because (45-40)/40 = 12.5%.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because that would mean the repair option is cheaper per year. But the question is about the average cost per year of the new tires being higher than the repair. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the problem.\n\nThe customer can choose between:\n\n1. New tires: $180 per tire, last four years. So average cost per year is 180/4 = $45.\n\n2. Repair current tires: $40 per tire, which makes them last one additional year.\n\nWait, but how many years will the current tires last after repair? Let's assume that the current tires have already been in use for some time, say, x years, and without repair, they would last y more years. But the problem doesn't give x or y.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires, without repair, would last one year. So repairing them adds another year, making their total lifespan two years.\n\nWait, that would make the average cost per year for repair: 40/2 = $20. Then new tires are $45, which is 45/20 = 2.25 times, which is 125% higher. But that's not an option. The options are 8,10,12.5,16.7,25%.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the repair option is considered as a one-time cost of $40 for one additional year, so the average cost per year for the repair is $40 per year (since it's a one-year extension). But that can't be right because that would make the new tires at 45 per year, which is 12.5% higher than 40. So the answer would be 12.5%, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, that would be the case if the repair only gives one year of use. So the customer pays $40 for one year of use. Alternatively, the current tires might have some remaining lifespan.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires have a certain remaining lifespan. Let me think of it as the customer is considering whether to repair the tires now or buy new ones.\n\nSuppose the customer has tires that have been used for three years. So without repair, they'll last one more year (total four). If repaired, they'll last two more years (total five).\n\nSo the cost for repair is $40 for two additional years. So average cost per year is 40/2 = $20 per year. Whereas the new tires cost $180 for four years, which is $45 per year.\n\nSo the new tires' cost is 45, the repair option is 20. So the new tires are 45/20 = 2.25 times more expensive, which is 125% higher. But that's not one of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires have been used for one year, so without repair, they'll last three more years. Repairing adds one more year, making it four years. So the repair cost is $40 for four years. So average cost per year is 40/4 = $10.\n\nNew tires are 45 per year, which is 45/10 = 4.5 times, which is 350% higher. Not an option.\n\nHmm, this approach isn't working because without knowing the current lifespan, it's impossible to calculate the average cost per year for the repair option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to model that the repair adds one year, so the total lifespan is current lifespan +1. But the problem says that the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So perhaps the current tires, without repair, would have lasted, say, x years, and with repair, they last x+1 years.\n\nBut without knowing x, how can we compute the average cost per year?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair adds one year to the original four-year lifespan. So the current tires, when new, last four years. If the customer repairs them, they can last five years. So the cost is $40, and lifespan is five years. So average cost per year is 40/5 = $8.\n\nNew tires: 180/4 =45.\n\nSo the new tires cost 45 per year, the repair is 8 per year. So 45 is higher than 8. The question is asking by what percentage the new tires' average cost is higher than the repair.\n\nSo (45-8)/8 = 37/8 = 4.625, which is 462.5% higher. But that's not an option either.\n\nHmm, I must be misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer's current tires have already been used for some time, and the repair only adds one year. So the total lifespan of the current tires after repair is, say, four years. But that's the same as the new tires. So why would someone repair?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer is considering whether to repair their current tires, which are about to fail, adding one year, or buy new tires for four years.\n\nSo, if the current tires are about to fail, then without repair, they have zero years left. Repairing gives one more year. So the repair cost is $40 for one year. The new tires cost $180 for four years.\n\nAverage cost per year:\n\nNew tires: 180 /4 =45.\n\nRepair:40 /1=40.\n\nSo the new tires are 45, repair is 40.\n\nThe percentage increase is (45-40)/40 =5/40=0.125=12.5%.\n\nWhich is option C.\n\nBut wait, the question says the customer can choose to purchase new tires or have his current tires repaired. So perhaps the current tires have some remaining life. For example, the customer is thinking about whether to repair the current tires (which would give them one more year) or buy new tires (which last four years). So the average cost per year for each option would be:\n\nIf he repairs, he pays $40 for one additional year. So the average cost is 40 per year.\n\nIf he buys new, 180 over four years: 45 per year.\n\nSo 45 is what percent higher than 40? (45-40)/40 =12.5%.\n\nSo the answer is 12.5%, option C.\n\nWait, but the question says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So perhaps the current tires have some remaining lifespan. For example, they have been used for three years, and without repair, they'll last one more (total four). Repairing adds one more, making five years.\n\nSo the average cost per year for repair is 40 /5 =8.\n\nNew tires are 45. So 45 is 45/8=5.625 times higher, which is 462.5% increase. Not an option.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the current tires have been used for two years. Without repair, they'll last two more years (total four). Repairing adds one more, making three more years (total five). So the average cost is 40/3 \u224813.33 per year.\n\nNew tires:45 per year.\n\nSo 45 /13.33\u22483.375, which is 237.5% increase. Not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the repair adds one year to the current tires, but the current tires are already at a point where they can't be repaired further. So the customer's current tires have, say, one year of life left. Repairing them adds one more, making two years. So the average cost is 40/2=20. New tires are 45. So 45 is 225% higher than 20. Not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer's current tires have zero life left. Repairing adds one year, making it one year. So average cost is 40 per year. New tires are 45, which is 12.5% higher.\n\nIn this case, the correct answer would be 12.5%, option C.\n\nBut how can the current tires have zero life left? That would mean they're about to fail, so the customer needs to repair or replace.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps the intended assumption is that the current tires have zero remaining life, and repairing them gives one more year. Therefore, the average cost per year for the repair is 40, and for new, it's 45. The percentage is (45-40)/40=12.5%.\n\nSo the answer should be C)12.5%.\n",

So repairing them adds another year, making their total lifespan two years.\n\nWait, that would make the average cost per year for repair: 40/2 = $20. Then new tires are $45, which is 45/20 = 2.25 times, which is 125% higher. But that's not an option. The options are 8,10,12.5,16.7,25%.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the repair option is considered as a one-time cost of $40 for one additional year, so the average cost per year for the repair is $40 per year (since it's a one-year extension). But that can't be right because that would make the new tires at 45 per year, which is 12.5% higher than 40. So the answer would be 12.5%, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, that would be the case if the repair only gives one year of use. So the customer pays $40 for one year of use. Alternatively, the current tires might have some remaining lifespan.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires have a certain remaining lifespan. Let me think of it as the customer is considering whether to repair the tires now or buy new ones.\n\nSuppose the customer has tires that have been used for three years. So without repair, they'll last one more year (total four). If repaired, they'll last two more years (total five).\n\nSo the cost for repair is $40 for two additional years. So average cost per year is 40/2 = $20 per year. Whereas the new tires cost $180 for four years, which is $45 per year.\n\nSo the new tires' cost is 45, the repair option is 20. So the new tires are 45/20 = 2.25 times more expensive, which is 125% higher. But that's not one of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires have been used for one year, so without repair, they'll last three more years. Repairing adds one more year, making it four years. So the repair cost is $40 for four years. So average cost per year is 40/4 = $10.\n\nNew tires are 45 per year, which is 45/10 = 4.5 times, which is 350% higher. Not an option.\n\nHmm, this approach isn't working because without knowing the current lifespan, it's impossible to calculate the average cost per year for the repair option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to model that the repair adds one year, so the total lifespan is current lifespan +1. But the problem says that the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So perhaps the current tires, without repair, would have lasted, say, x years, and with repair, they last x+1 years.\n\nBut without knowing x, how can we compute the average cost per year?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair adds one year to the original four-year lifespan. So the current tires, when new, last four years. If the customer repairs them, they can last five years. So the cost is $40, and lifespan is five years. So average cost per year is 40/5 = $8.\n\nNew tires: 180/4 =45.\n\nSo the new tires cost 45 per year, the repair is 8 per year. So 45 is higher than 8. The question is asking by what percentage the new tires' average cost is higher than the repair.\n\nSo (45-8)/8 = 37/8 = 4.625, which is 462.5% higher. But that's not an option either.\n\nHmm, I must be misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer's current tires have already been used for some time, and the repair only adds one year. So the total lifespan of the current tires after repair is, say, four years. But that's the same as the new tires. So why would someone repair?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer is considering whether to repair their current tires, which are about to fail, adding one year, or buy new tires for four years.\n\nSo, if the current tires are about to fail, then without repair, they have zero years left. Repairing gives one more year. So the repair cost is $40 for one year. The new tires cost $180 for four years.\n\nAverage cost per year:\n\nNew tires: 180 /4 =45.\n\nRepair:40 /1=40.\n\nSo the new tires are 45, repair is 40.\n\nThe percentage increase is (45-40)/40 =5/40=0.125=12.5%.\n\nWhich is option C.\n\nBut wait, the question says the customer can choose to purchase new tires or have his current tires repaired. So perhaps the current tires have some remaining life. For example, the customer is thinking about whether to repair the current tires (which would give them one more year) or buy new tires (which last four years). So the average cost per year for each option would be:\n\nIf he repairs, he pays $40 for one additional year. So the average cost is 40 per year.\n\nIf he buys new, 180 over four years: 45 per year.\n\nSo 45 is what percent higher than 40? (45-40)/40 =12.5%.\n\nSo the answer is 12.5%, option C.\n\nWait, but the question says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So perhaps the current tires have some remaining lifespan. For example, they have been used for three years, and without repair, they'll last one more (total four). Repairing adds one more, making five years.\n\nSo the average cost per year for repair is 40 /5 =8.\n\nNew tires are 45. So 45 is 45/8=5.625 times higher, which is 462.5% increase. Not an option.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the current tires have been used for two years. Without repair, they'll last two more years (total four). Repairing adds one more, making three more years (total five). So the average cost is 40/3 \u224813.33 per year.\n\nNew tires:45 per year.\n\nSo 45 /13.33\u22483.375, which is 237.5% increase. Not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the repair adds one year to the current tires, but the current tires are already at a point where they can't be repaired further. So the customer's current tires have, say, one year of life left. Repairing them adds one more, making two years. So the average cost is 40/2=20. New tires are 45. So 45 is 225% higher than 20. Not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer's current tires have zero life left. Repairing adds one year, making it one year. So average cost is 40 per year. New tires are 45, which is 12.5% higher.\n\nIn this case, the correct answer would be 12.5%, option C.\n\nBut how can the current tires have zero life left? That would mean they're about to fail, so the customer needs to repair or replace.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps the intended assumption is that the current tires have zero remaining life, and repairing them gives one more year. Therefore, the average cost per year for the repair is 40, and for new, it's 45. The percentage is (45-40)/40=12.5%.\n\nSo the answer should be C)12.5%.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage by which the average cost per year of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires, we analyze the two options provided:\n\n1. **New Tires**:  \n   - Cost: $180 per tire.  \n   - Lifespan: 4 years.  \n   - Average cost per year:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{180}{4} = 45 \\, \\text{\\$/year}.\n     \\]\n\n2. **Repairing Current Tires**:  \n   - Cost: $40 per tire.  \n   - Lifespan: 1 additional year.  \n   - Average cost per year:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{40}{1} = 40 \\, \\text{\\$/year}.\n     \\]\n\nTo find the percentage by which the average cost per year of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires, we use the formula:  \n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{New Cost} - \\text{Repair Cost}}{\\text{Repair Cost}} \\right) \\times 100.\n\\]  \nSubstituting the values:  \n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{45 - 40}{40} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{5}{40} \\right) \\times 100 = 12.5\\%.\n\\]\n\nThus, the average cost per year of new tires is **12.5%** greater than the cost of repairing the current tires.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about tires and their costs over time. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of percentage problems, but I'll take it slow.\n\nAlright, the question says that new tires from a certain brand last for four years when purchased. The customer has two options: buy new tires at $180 each or repair their current tires for $40 each, which extends their life by one more year. The question is asking about the average cost per year of the new tires compared to repairing, and how much greater it is in percentage terms.\n\nWait, so I need to find the average cost per year for each option and then calculate what percentage the new tires' cost is higher than the repaired ones.\n\nLet me think. For the new tires, each tire costs $180 and lasts four years. So the average cost per year would be total cost divided by the number of years. That would be $180 divided by 4. Let me do that math: 180 / 4 equals 45. So the new tires cost $45 per year on average.\n\nNow, the other option is repairing the current tires. Each repair costs $40 and adds one year of life. Wait, but how many years are we considering here? The original tire life is four years. If I repair it once, does that make it last five years total? Because the new tires are for four years, but the existing tires are being repaired. Let me clarify: the problem says the tires last for four years when purchased new. So the current tires are already in use and have been for some time, but the customer is considering whether to replace them or repair them.\n\nWait, actually, the problem says when purchased, they last four years. So the customer is currently using some tires, perhaps past their four-year mark? Or maybe the question is about the first four years and then an additional year if repaired.\n\nWait, perhaps the scenario is that the customer is looking to replace the tires. If they buy new ones, each lasts four years. Alternatively, they can repair their current tires, which would make them last one more year. So the current tires have been around for some years, and the repair gives them an extra year. But wait, how many years have the current tires already been in use?\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the problem again. The customer can either buy new tires that last four years, or repair the current tires for $40 each, which extends their life by one additional year. So perhaps the current tires are already in their fourth year, and the repair would make them last for one more year (so five years in total), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the customer is considering whether to buy new tires (cost $180 each, lasts four years) or repair their current tires for $40 each, making them last one more year beyond their current lifespan.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial state is that the customer is looking to replace the tires. So the current tires have been used for four years and are now being considered for repair or replacement. If they repair, the tire can last one more year. So the cost would be $40 for one additional year of use.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me rephrase. The problem says when purchased new, the tires last four years. The customer can choose between buying new tires for $180 each or repairing current tires for $40 each, which makes them last one additional year.\n\nSo, perhaps the current tires are already in use, and the customer is deciding whether to repair them for an extra year or buy new ones. So, if they repair, they get one more year of use, and if they buy new, they get four years. But the question is about the average cost per year. So for each option, I need to calculate the cost per year.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the new tires last four years when purchased. So if the customer buys new tires now, each will last four years, meaning each tire will be used for four years. So the cost is $180 for four years. The average cost per year is 180/4 = $45 per year, as I calculated earlier.\n\nFor the repair option, each tire can be repaired for $40, which extends its life by one year. So, how many years does each tire last with repair? Well, the original four years plus one more year, making five years. So the total cost for each tire would be $40 for five years of use. Wait, but is the $40 the cost for each repair? Or is it that each repair adds a year, and the customer can repair multiple times?\n\nWait, the problem states: \"a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\" So each repair adds one year. So if a tire is already four years old, and you repair it once, it can last one more year (total five). But the question is about the average cost per year for each option. So for the repair option, each tire is being used for five years, right? Because the repair adds one year to their original four.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Suppose the customer is currently using tires that are four years old. They can either replace them now (buy new, which will last four more years, making total five years from when they were new), or repair them, which adds one more year to their current four-year lifespan. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, the customer's current tires have been in use for some time, but perhaps they're at year 4, and the repair would make them last one more year. So the total lifespan for the current tire with repair is five years.\n\nBut perhaps the question isn't about the current tires' original lifespan but about the cost per year when considering the options. Let me approach this differently.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Each tire costs $180 and lasts four years. So the average cost per year is 180/4 = 45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires. Each repair costs $40 and adds one year. So, for each tire, the cost is $40 and it lasts one more year. But wait, how many times can you repair? Or is this a one-time repair? The problem doesn't specify, but perhaps the customer is considering whether to repair their current tires once, giving them an extra year. So, perhaps the repair adds one year, making the tire last five years in total (since the new tires last four, but perhaps the current ones are already four years old and can be extended to five with a repair).\n\nWait, no, the problem says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So the current tires, without repair, would have been good for four years. With repair, they last one more year, so five years total.\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't specify whether the current tires are in their fourth year or if they're just any tires. Hmm, perhaps the customer is considering whether to buy new tires now or to repair the current ones, which would last an extra year.\n\nWait, maybe the current tires have been used for some time, but their remaining life is zero. So without repair, they can't last any more years. But that doesn't make sense because the problem says the repair makes them last for one additional year. So perhaps the current tires have been in use for four years, and if you repair them, they can last one more year. So, each tire with repair would last five years. Or perhaps the current tires are being used, and the repair will make them last one more year, making it five years in total.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way to model this is:\n\nIf the customer buys new tires now, each tire will last four years. So for four years, the customer uses the new tires, paying $180 each. The average cost per year is 180 / 4 = 45.\n\nAlternatively, the customer can repair their current tires for $40 each, which makes each tire last one more year. So, the current tires would last one more year beyond their original four. Wait, but if the customer's current tires have already been in use for four years, then a repair would give them an additional year, making it five years. So for each tire, the cost is 40, and it's used for one year.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the average cost per year would be 40 over one year, which is 40 per year. But that seems too high compared to the 45 of new tires. Alternatively, perhaps the current tires are about to end their four-year lifespan, and repairing them would make them last one more year, so the total lifespan becomes five years.\n\nWait, but perhaps the customer is comparing the two options: buy new tires now, or repair the current ones once, which would let them use the current tires for an additional year. But that's not the same as the new tires which last four years. So perhaps the repair is an alternative to buying new, but the question is about the average cost per year of each option.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is comparing the two options on a per-year basis, but I'm not getting it right. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem is asking for the average cost per year of the new tires compared to the cost of repairing. So, for each option, what's the average cost per year, and then find what percentage greater the new tire cost is compared to the repair cost.\n\nSo, new tires: $180 for four years. So average per year is 180 /4 = 45.\n\nRepairing: $40 for one additional year. So the tire is used for one year, costing 40. So average per year is 40 / 1 =40.\n\nWait, but that would make the new tires cost 45 per year, and the repair option 40 per year. So the question is, 45 is what percent greater than 40.\n\nSo the percentage increase is calculated as ((45 -40)/40)*100% = (5/40)*100% = 12.5%.\n\nWait, but that would make the answer 12.5%, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Because when you repair, you pay $40 for one year. So the average cost per year is 40. So the new tires are 45, which is 5 more than 40. 5/40 is 0.125, which is 12.5% higher.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the customer can repair multiple times. For example, if they repair every year, each time paying $40 for an additional year. So each tire would last n years, with each repair adding a year. But that's probably not the case because the problem states that the repair adds one additional year, implying a single repair. Or maybe it's a one-time repair, giving an extra year beyond the original four.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer's current tires are four years old, and without repair, they would last four years, but with repair, they last five years. So for the repair option, the cost is $40 for five years of use. So the average cost per year would be 40/5 = 8.\n\nWait, that would change things. Let me recalculate. So if the repair adds one year, making the tire last five years, then the average cost per year is 40 /5 = 8. Then, the new tire's average is 45. So the question is, 45 is what percent higher than 8.\n\nSo, (45-8)/8 = 37/8 = 4.625, which is 462.5%. That's not one of the options, so that can't be right. So perhaps my initial approach was correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I misread the problem. Let me read it again.\n\n\"A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\"\n\nAh, so the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So if the current tires were going to last four years, the repair makes them last five. Or perhaps the current tires have been in use for four years and would otherwise not last any longer, and the repair gives one more year.\n\nWait, no, the way it's phrased is that the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So the current tires, without repair, might last some time, and the repair adds one year. But the problem says when purchased new, they last four years. So perhaps the current tires have been used for four years and are about to wear out. So the repair adds one more year, making their total lifespan five years. So the cost is $40 for five years of use.\n\nWait, but that's not matching. Because if the customer buys new tires now, each tire will last four years, so the average cost is 180/4=45 per year. If the customer repairs their current tires, each repair costs 40, and the tire lasts one additional year beyond its original four. So the total lifespan is five years, with the repair cost being 40.\n\nWait, but that would make the average cost per year 40/5=8.\n\nSo comparing 45 (new) to 8 (repair), the new tires are 45/8 = 5.625 times more expensive. So the percentage increase is (45-8)/8 *100 = (37/8)*100 = 462.5%, which is way higher than the options given. So that can't be right. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is done each year, so the customer can choose to repair each year, adding a year each time. But that seems unlikely. The problem states it's a single repair that adds one year. So perhaps the customer has the option to repair once, giving them one more year, but the new tires are a one-time purchase for four years.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer is considering whether to buy new tires now, which will last four years, or repair their current tires once, which will make them last one more year. So the customer is comparing two scenarios:\n\n1. Buy new tires: cost $180, lasts four years. Average cost: 180/4=45/year.\n\n2. Repair current tires: cost $40, lasts one more year. So the tire is used for one year, cost 40. Average cost: 40/1=40/year.\n\nIn this case, the new tires are 45, the repair is 40. So the percentage increase is (45-40)/40 *100 = 12.5%. So the answer would be C) 12.5%.\n\nBut why would the customer repair the current tires? Because perhaps the current tires are already in use for some time, but the problem doesn't specify. Alternatively, perhaps the repair is an alternative to buying new tires, but it's not clear. \n\nWait, perhaps the customer is considering whether to buy new tires or repair their current tires, which would make them last one more year. So the customer is choosing between using their current tires for one more year after repair, or buying new tires that last four years.\n\nWait, that can't be right because if the customer buys new tires, they have four years of use. If they repair, they get one more year. So the question is, what is the average cost per year for each option.\n\nWait, maybe I should model it differently. Let's think about the cost per year for each option over the same time frame. But that's unclear. Let's say the customer is deciding whether to buy new tires now or repair their current tires to get an extra year. So, for the next four years, they can have new tires, costing 180 each. Or, for the next year, they can repair their current tires for 40 each. So the average cost per year for the new option is 45, as before. For the repair option, the cost is 40 for one year, so 40 per year. So 45 is 12.5% higher than 40.\n\nBut that seems a bit odd because the repair option only covers one year. But maybe the question is considering the average cost over the period each option covers. So, the new tires are over four years, the repair is over one year. So the average cost per year for each option is 45 and 40, respectively. So 45 is 12.5% higher than 40.\n\nSo the correct answer would be 12.5%, which is option C.\n",

So if a tire is already four years old, and you repair it once, it can last one more year (total five). But the question is about the average cost per year for each option. So for the repair option, each tire is being used for five years, right? Because the repair adds one year to their original four.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Suppose the customer is currently using tires that are four years old. They can either replace them now (buy new, which will last four more years, making total five years from when they were new), or repair them, which adds one more year to their current four-year lifespan. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, the customer's current tires have been in use for some time, but perhaps they're at year 4, and the repair would make them last one more year. So the total lifespan for the current tire with repair is five years.\n\nBut perhaps the question isn't about the current tires' original lifespan but about the cost per year when considering the options. Let me approach this differently.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Each tire costs $180 and lasts four years. So the average cost per year is 180/4 = 45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires. Each repair costs $40 and adds one year. So, for each tire, the cost is $40 and it lasts one more year. But wait, how many times can you repair? Or is this a one-time repair? The problem doesn't specify, but perhaps the customer is considering whether to repair their current tires once, giving them an extra year. So, perhaps the repair adds one year, making the tire last five years in total (since the new tires last four, but perhaps the current ones are already four years old and can be extended to five with a repair).\n\nWait, no, the problem says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So the current tires, without repair, would have been good for four years. With repair, they last one more year, so five years total.\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't specify whether the current tires are in their fourth year or if they're just any tires. Hmm, perhaps the customer is considering whether to buy new tires now or to repair the current ones, which would last an extra year.\n\nWait, maybe the current tires have been used for some time, but their remaining life is zero. So without repair, they can't last any more years. But that doesn't make sense because the problem says the repair makes them last for one additional year. So perhaps the current tires have been in use for four years, and if you repair them, they can last one more year. So, each tire with repair would last five years. Or perhaps the current tires are being used, and the repair will make them last one more year, making it five years in total.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way to model this is:\n\nIf the customer buys new tires now, each tire will last four years. So for four years, the customer uses the new tires, paying $180 each. The average cost per year is 180 / 4 = 45.\n\nAlternatively, the customer can repair their current tires for $40 each, which makes each tire last one more year. So, the current tires would last one more year beyond their original four. Wait, but if the customer's current tires have already been in use for four years, then a repair would give them an additional year, making it five years. So for each tire, the cost is 40, and it's used for one year.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the average cost per year would be 40 over one year, which is 40 per year. But that seems too high compared to the 45 of new tires. Alternatively, perhaps the current tires are about to end their four-year lifespan, and repairing them would make them last one more year, so the total lifespan becomes five years.\n\nWait, but perhaps the customer is comparing the two options: buy new tires now, or repair the current ones once, which would let them use the current tires for an additional year. But that's not the same as the new tires which last four years. So perhaps the repair is an alternative to buying new, but the question is about the average cost per year of each option.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is comparing the two options on a per-year basis, but I'm not getting it right. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem is asking for the average cost per year of the new tires compared to the cost of repairing. So, for each option, what's the average cost per year, and then find what percentage greater the new tire cost is compared to the repair cost.\n\nSo, new tires: $180 for four years. So average per year is 180 /4 = 45.\n\nRepairing: $40 for one additional year. So the tire is used for one year, costing 40. So average per year is 40 / 1 =40.\n\nWait, but that would make the new tires cost 45 per year, and the repair option 40 per year. So the question is, 45 is what percent greater than 40.\n\nSo the percentage increase is calculated as ((45 -40)/40)*100% = (5/40)*100% = 12.5%.\n\nWait, but that would make the answer 12.5%, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Because when you repair, you pay $40 for one year. So the average cost per year is 40. So the new tires are 45, which is 5 more than 40. 5/40 is 0.125, which is 12.5% higher.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the customer can repair multiple times. For example, if they repair every year, each time paying $40 for an additional year. So each tire would last n years, with each repair adding a year. But that's probably not the case because the problem states that the repair adds one additional year, implying a single repair. Or maybe it's a one-time repair, giving an extra year beyond the original four.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer's current tires are four years old, and without repair, they would last four years, but with repair, they last five years. So for the repair option, the cost is $40 for five years of use. So the average cost per year would be 40/5 = 8.\n\nWait, that would change things. Let me recalculate. So if the repair adds one year, making the tire last five years, then the average cost per year is 40 /5 = 8. Then, the new tire's average is 45. So the question is, 45 is what percent higher than 8.\n\nSo, (45-8)/8 = 37/8 = 4.625, which is 462.5%. That's not one of the options, so that can't be right. So perhaps my initial approach was correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I misread the problem. Let me read it again.\n\n\"A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\"\n\nAh, so the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So if the current tires were going to last four years, the repair makes them last five. Or perhaps the current tires have been in use for four years and would otherwise not last any longer, and the repair gives one more year.\n\nWait, no, the way it's phrased is that the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So the current tires, without repair, might last some time, and the repair adds one year. But the problem says when purchased new, they last four years. So perhaps the current tires have been used for four years and are about to wear out. So the repair adds one more year, making their total lifespan five years. So the cost is $40 for five years of use.\n\nWait, but that's not matching. Because if the customer buys new tires now, each tire will last four years, so the average cost is 180/4=45 per year. If the customer repairs their current tires, each repair costs 40, and the tire lasts one additional year beyond its original four. So the total lifespan is five years, with the repair cost being 40.\n\nWait, but that would make the average cost per year 40/5=8.\n\nSo comparing 45 (new) to 8 (repair), the new tires are 45/8 = 5.625 times more expensive. So the percentage increase is (45-8)/8 *100 = (37/8)*100 = 462.5%, which is way higher than the options given. So that can't be right. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is done each year, so the customer can choose to repair each year, adding a year each time. But that seems unlikely. The problem states it's a single repair that adds one year. So perhaps the customer has the option to repair once, giving them one more year, but the new tires are a one-time purchase for four years.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer is considering whether to buy new tires now, which will last four years, or repair their current tires once, which will make them last one more year. So the customer is comparing two scenarios:\n\n1. Buy new tires: cost $180, lasts four years. Average cost: 180/4=45/year.\n\n2. Repair current tires: cost $40, lasts one more year. So the tire is used for one year, cost 40. Average cost: 40/1=40/year.\n\nIn this case, the new tires are 45, the repair is 40. So the percentage increase is (45-40)/40 *100 = 12.5%. So the answer would be C) 12.5%.\n\nBut why would the customer repair the current tires? Because perhaps the current tires are already in use for some time, but the problem doesn't specify. Alternatively, perhaps the repair is an alternative to buying new tires, but it's not clear. \n\nWait, perhaps the customer is considering whether to buy new tires or repair their current tires, which would make them last one more year. So the customer is choosing between using their current tires for one more year after repair, or buying new tires that last four years.\n\nWait, that can't be right because if the customer buys new tires, they have four years of use. If they repair, they get one more year. So the question is, what is the average cost per year for each option.\n\nWait, maybe I should model it differently. Let's think about the cost per year for each option over the same time frame. But that's unclear. Let's say the customer is deciding whether to buy new tires now or repair their current tires to get an extra year. So, for the next four years, they can have new tires, costing 180 each. Or, for the next year, they can repair their current tires for 40 each. So the average cost per year for the new option is 45, as before. For the repair option, the cost is 40 for one year, so 40 per year. So 45 is 12.5% higher than 40.\n\nBut that seems a bit odd because the repair option only covers one year. But maybe the question is considering the average cost over the period each option covers. So, the new tires are over four years, the repair is over one year. So the average cost per year for each option is 45 and 40, respectively. So 45 is 12.5% higher than 40.\n\nSo the correct answer would be 12.5%, which is option C.\n\n\nTo determine the average cost per year of the new tires compared to repairing the current tires, we analyze both options:\n\n### Option 1: New Tires\n- **Cost per tire**: $180  \n- **Lifespan**: 4 years  \n- **Average cost per year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{180}{4} = 45 \\, \\text{\\$/year}\n  \\]\n\n### Option 2: Repairing Current Tires\n- **Cost per repair**: $40  \n- **Additional lifespan**: 1 year  \n- **Average cost per year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{40}{1} = 40 \\, \\text{\\$/year}\n  \\]\n\n### Percentage Increase\nTo find how much greater the average cost of new tires is compared to repairing, we calculate the percentage increase:  \n\\[\n\\text{Percentage increase} = \\left( \\frac{45 - 40}{40} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{5}{40} \\right) \\times 100 = 12.5\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, the average cost per year of new tires is **12.5% greater** than the cost of repairing the current tires.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about tire costs, and I need to figure out the percentage difference in the average cost per year between buying new tires and repairing the current ones. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nAlright, first, the problem says that new tires last for four years and cost $180 each. On the other hand, repairing the current tires costs $40 each and extends their life by one year. So, I guess the current tires would last for five years with the repair? Or wait, no, wait. Let me read that again. Oh, wait, the repair makes them last one additional year. So if the original tires were, say, after purchase, they last four years, but when you repair them, they get an extra year, making it five years total? Or maybe the original tires are already used and the repair gives them an extra year beyond their initial lifespan? Hmm, the problem says \"when purchased new, last for four years.\" So the customer already has tires, and they can either buy new ones for $180 each, which last four years, or repair their current tires for $40 each, which adds one more year to their life.\n\nWait, but the question is about the average cost per year for each option. So I need to calculate the average cost per year for both buying new and repairing, then find the percentage increase from the repair cost to the new cost.\n\nLet me think. For the new tires: each tire costs $180 and lasts four years. So the average cost per year would be 180 divided by 4. Let me compute that: 180 /4 = 45. So $45 per year per tire.\n\nNow for the repair option: the customer can repair the current tires for $40 each, and that gives them one additional year. Wait, but how long do the tires last after repair? If the original tires were already, say, four years old, and then you repair them for another year, that makes them last five years total? Or do they last for four years plus one, so five? Or maybe the repair is done on the current tires, which have already been used for some time. Hmm, the problem says the customer can choose to repair the current tires, which will make them last for one additional year. So I think that the current tires, without repair, have some life left. But how much? The problem doesn't specify. Oh wait, perhaps the repair is an alternative to buying new ones, so maybe the current tires have already been used for a certain time, but the problem doesn't state that. Hmm, maybe I need to assume that the current tires would last for three years without repair, making the repair add one year to make it four? Wait, no, that's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps the repair just adds one year to the current lifespan. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simpler. Maybe the current tires have already been used for some time, but the problem doesn't say. Alternatively, perhaps the repair is done on tires that are already in use, and the repair adds one year to their lifespan. But without knowing their current lifespan, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the repair is an alternative to buying new. So, if you buy new, they last four years. If you repair, you keep the current tires for one more year. But how long have the current tires already been in use?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the problem again: \"A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\" So, the repair adds one year to the current tires' life. So, if the current tires have, say, X years of life left, the repair extends that to X+1 years. But the problem doesn't specify how much life they have left now. Hmm, that complicates things. Because without knowing X, I can't calculate the average cost per year for the repair option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem implies that the current tires are already nearing the end of their lifespan, so the repair gives them one more year beyond their original four years. Or maybe the repair is just adding one year regardless of their current state. Alternatively, maybe the repair is done on the current tires which are already four years old, making them last five years. But the problem doesn't specify how old the current tires are. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the current tires have four years of life left, and the repair adds another year, making them last five years. But that doesn't make much sense because if the customer is considering buying new tires, which last four years, why would they repair their current ones which are already four years old? Alternatively, perhaps the current tires are already two years old, and the repair adds one year, making them last three years. Hmm, but without that info, I can't proceed.\n\nWait, maybe the question is intended to consider the repair as an option that adds one year to the current tires, regardless of their current state. So, perhaps the customer can choose between replacing now or repairing for an extra year. But without knowing how long the current tires have left, perhaps we can assume that the repair is an alternative that adds one year beyond the current lifespan. Alternatively, perhaps the current tires are already four years old, so the repair makes them last five years. Hmm, but that's an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the repair is an option that gives the tires an extra year, regardless of their current condition. So the cost per year for the repair option would be $40 spread over one year, since the repair adds only one year. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the customer would have already used the tires for some time before the repair. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is meant to be read as: If the customer buys new tires, they cost $180 and last four years. If they repair the current tires, it's $40, which extends their life by one year. So, the current tires would have, after repair, a total lifespan of (original lifespan +1). But the original lifespan isn't given. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm supposed to assume that the current tires are four years old, and the repair would make them last one more year (so five years total). But that would mean the customer has had the tires for four years, and the repair would add one more. But then, the average cost per year for the repair would be $40 over one year, which is $40 per year. But that seems high, but let's see.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe the current tires can be repaired for $40, which makes them last for one additional year. So regardless of their current state, the repair gives them one more year. So, if the customer chooses to repair, the tires will last for one more year, so the total lifespan is increased by one year. But without knowing their initial remaining lifespan, it's unclear. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm supposed to compare the two options based on the cost per year over the same period. For example, the new tires cost $180 for four years, so $45 per year. The repair is $40 for one additional year, so the repair cost is $40 for one year, which is $40 per year. But that can't be, because if the customer is considering whether to repair or buy new, perhaps the repair is a one-time cost, but the new tires are an upfront cost.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about the average cost per year over the same period. For example, if the customer buys new tires, they get four years of use for $180, so average is $45 per year. If they repair, they can extend the life of their current tires by one year, so perhaps their total lifespan becomes five years, with a total cost of $40. So the average cost would be 40 / 5 = $8 per year. Wait, that can't be right because that would make the new tires cost way higher. But wait, let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is for the current tires, which are already one year old. So the repair adds one year, making them last two years. Hmm, but again, without knowing the current state, it's hard.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is intended to have the current tires last for four years with repair, so without repair, they last three years. So the repair adds one year, making it four. Then the average cost per year for the repair would be $40 over four years, which is $10 per year. Then, comparing to the new tires, which are $45 per year. So the percentage increase would be ((45 - 10)/10) *100 = 350% increase. But that's not one of the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me reread the problem.\n\nThe problem states: When purchased new, the tires last four years. The customer can either buy new at $180 each, or repair current at $40 each, which makes the current tires last one additional year. The question is about the average cost per year of new tires versus repair.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair is done on the current tires, which are already four years old. So without repair, they would last four years, but with repair, they last five years. So the repair cost is $40 for an extra year. So the average cost for the repair option would be $40 spread over one year, which is $40 per year. While the new tires are $180 for four years, which is $45 per year.\n\nWait, but that can't be because the repair is adding one year, not replacing four. So for the repair, the customer pays $40 for an extra year. So the cost per year for that extra year is $40.\n\nWait, but the new tires are a one-time cost of $180 for four years, so the average is $45 per year. The repair is a one-time $40 for an extra year, so the average is $40 per year. So the new tires cost $45 per year, repair is $40. So the question is, what's the percentage increase from the repair to the new tires.\n\nSo the formula would be: (new cost - repair cost)/repair cost * 100.\n\nSo (45 -40)/40 *100 = (5)/40 *100 = 12.5%.\n\nSo the average cost per year of new tires is 12.5% higher than repairing.\n\nLooking at the options, C is 12.5%, so the answer would be C.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the percentage increase in the average cost per year of new tires compared to repairing the current tires, we analyze both options:\n\n1. **New Tires**:  \n   - Cost per tire: $180  \n   - Lifespan: 4 years  \n   - Average cost per year:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{180}{4} = 45 \\, \\text{dollars per year}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Repairing Current Tires**:  \n   - Cost per tire: $40  \n   - Additional lifespan: 1 year  \n   - Total lifespan after repair: 1 year (since the repair only extends the tire's life by one year).  \n   - Average cost per year:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{40}{1} = 40 \\, \\text{dollars per year}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Percentage Increase**:  \n   The average cost per year of new tires is compared to the cost of repairing the current tires.

So, if the customer chooses to repair, the tires will last for one more year, so the total lifespan is increased by one year. But without knowing their initial remaining lifespan, it's unclear. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm supposed to compare the two options based on the cost per year over the same period. For example, the new tires cost $180 for four years, so $45 per year. The repair is $40 for one additional year, so the repair cost is $40 for one year, which is $40 per year. But that can't be, because if the customer is considering whether to repair or buy new, perhaps the repair is a one-time cost, but the new tires are an upfront cost.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about the average cost per year over the same period. For example, if the customer buys new tires, they get four years of use for $180, so average is $45 per year. If they repair, they can extend the life of their current tires by one year, so perhaps their total lifespan becomes five years, with a total cost of $40. So the average cost would be 40 / 5 = $8 per year. Wait, that can't be right because that would make the new tires cost way higher. But wait, let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is for the current tires, which are already one year old. So the repair adds one year, making them last two years. Hmm, but again, without knowing the current state, it's hard.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is intended to have the current tires last for four years with repair, so without repair, they last three years. So the repair adds one year, making it four. Then the average cost per year for the repair would be $40 over four years, which is $10 per year. Then, comparing to the new tires, which are $45 per year. So the percentage increase would be ((45 - 10)/10) *100 = 350% increase. But that's not one of the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me reread the problem.\n\nThe problem states: When purchased new, the tires last four years. The customer can either buy new at $180 each, or repair current at $40 each, which makes the current tires last one additional year. The question is about the average cost per year of new tires versus repair.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair is done on the current tires, which are already four years old. So without repair, they would last four years, but with repair, they last five years. So the repair cost is $40 for an extra year. So the average cost for the repair option would be $40 spread over one year, which is $40 per year. While the new tires are $180 for four years, which is $45 per year.\n\nWait, but that can't be because the repair is adding one year, not replacing four. So for the repair, the customer pays $40 for an extra year. So the cost per year for that extra year is $40.\n\nWait, but the new tires are a one-time cost of $180 for four years, so the average is $45 per year. The repair is a one-time $40 for an extra year, so the average is $40 per year. So the new tires cost $45 per year, repair is $40. So the question is, what's the percentage increase from the repair to the new tires.\n\nSo the formula would be: (new cost - repair cost)/repair cost * 100.\n\nSo (45 -40)/40 *100 = (5)/40 *100 = 12.5%.\n\nSo the average cost per year of new tires is 12.5% higher than repairing.\n\nLooking at the options, C is 12.5%, so the answer would be C.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage increase in the average cost per year of new tires compared to repairing the current tires, we analyze both options:\n\n1. **New Tires**:  \n   - Cost per tire: $180  \n   - Lifespan: 4 years  \n   - Average cost per year:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{180}{4} = 45 \\, \\text{dollars per year}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Repairing Current Tires**:  \n   - Cost per tire: $40  \n   - Additional lifespan: 1 year  \n   - Total lifespan after repair: 1 year (since the repair only extends the tire's life by one year).  \n   - Average cost per year:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{40}{1} = 40 \\, \\text{dollars per year}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Percentage Increase**:  \n   The average cost per year of new tires is compared to the cost of repairing the current tires. The formula for percentage increase is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{New Cost} - \\text{Repair Cost}}{\\text{Repair Cost}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]  \n   Substituting the values:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{45 - 40}{40} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{5}{40} \\right) \\times 100 = 12.5\\%\n   \\]\n\nThus, the average cost per year of new tires is **12.5% greater** than the cost of repairing the current tires.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about tires and their costs. Let me try to wrap my head around it. \n\nAlright, the question is about comparing the average cost per year for new tires versus repairing the current ones. Hmm, I need to find out by what percentage the average cost of new tires is greater than the repair option. \n\nLet me read the problem again. So, when new, the tires last for four years and cost $180 each. Alternatively, you can repair them for $40 each, which extends their life by one more year. So, the repaired tires would last five years instead of four.\n\nWait, the problem says the customer can choose between buying new tires at $180 each or repairing current ones at $40 each for an extra year. So, I think I need to calculate the average cost per year for each option and then find the percentage increase from repair to new.\n\nLet me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, for the new tires. Each tire costs $180 and lasts four years. So the average cost per year would be the total cost divided by the number of years. So that's 180 divided by 4. Let me compute that. 180 /4 is 45. So, the average cost per year for new tires is $45.\n\nNext, the repair option. Each repair is $40 and adds one more year to the tire's life. Wait, so the original life is four years, and repair makes it five. So, the total cost for the repair option is $40 per tire. But wait, wait\u2014does the customer have to pay $40 each time they repair, or is it a one-time repair? Hmm, the wording says \"can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\" So, I think it's a one-time repair cost of $40, which adds one year to the existing four. So, the tires last for five years, costing $40 in total for the repair. But wait, wait\u2014wait, the original tires are already being used. So, the customer is choosing between replacing them now or repairing them once. \n\nWait, no, I think the scenario is that the customer currently has tires that are perhaps four years old, so they need to decide whether to buy new ones or repair the old ones. Or maybe the question is about whether to replace them every four years or repair once to get an extra year. Hmm, perhaps the customer is looking to extend the life of the tires beyond four years, either by replacing or repairing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer is considering whether to buy new tires now or repair their current tires. So, if they buy new, each tire is $180 and lasts four years. If they repair, each tire costs $40 and lasts one more year, making it five years total.\n\nWait, no, I think the customer is looking at their current tires, which are perhaps already in use. So, the customer can either replace them now, paying $180 each for new tires that will last four years, or repair them for $40 each, making the current tires last one more year (so five years total from the repair). So, the total cost for each tire would be either $180 for four years or $40 for five years.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the original tires have already been used for some time. Or perhaps the problem is that when you buy new tires, they last four years, but if you repair, you can get one more year. So, perhaps the question is about the average cost per year over the life of the tires.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as two options: \n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Each tire costs $180 and lasts 4 years. So, the average cost per year is 180 /4 = $45 per year.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires. Each repair is $40, and it adds one year to their life. So, the tires now last 5 years. The total cost is $40, so average per year is 40 /5 = $8 per year.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because if the repair is $40 and the tires last for an additional year, the total life is five years. So, the total cost is $40 for five years. So, average cost per year is 40 /5 = 8.\n\nSo, now, the average cost per year for new tires is $45, and for repair it's $8. Wait, that seems too low. Did I get that right?\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the repair option. Maybe the customer has the option to repair the current tires, which would cost $40 per tire, and this repair will make the current tires last one additional year. So, the current tires, without repair, have some remaining life. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer's current tires are about to need replacement (i.e., after four years). So, the customer can either buy new tires now for $180 each, which will last four years, or repair the current tires for $40 each, which would make them last one more year (so total of five years from when the repair is done).\n\nBut wait, when you repair, you're adding an extra year to the current tires. So, if the current tires have already been used for, say, four years, then a repair would give them one more year. But that would make the life five years in total, but the cost is $40 for that extra year.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the customer is considering whether to repair their current tires, which are still in use, to get an extra year, rather than buying new ones. So, the new tires are a replacement, and the repair is an alternative.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the customer can choose to buy new tires now, which cost $180 each and last four years, or repair their current tires for $40 each, which will extend their life by one year, making the total life five years from the time of repair.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer's current tires are already four years old. So, if they repair them, they'll last one more year. So, the total life would be five years from now. Alternatively, buying new tires now, they'll last four years, so they would need to be replaced again in four years.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is about average cost over the tire's life. So, for new tires, it's $180 for four years. For the repair, it's $40 for an additional year of life. But wait, maybe the repair is in addition to the original cost of the tires. Hmm, but the problem doesn't mention the original cost of the current tires. So, perhaps the problem is assuming that the customer is at the point where their current tires are about to need replacement, and they can either replace them now or repair them.\n\nSo, perhaps the customer is choosing between two options for their current tires:\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires now for $180 each, which will last four years.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires for $40 each, which will make them last one more year (so, five years in total, from the time of purchase of the new tires).\n\nWait, no, because the problem states that the new tires last four years, while the repair makes the current tires last one additional year. So, perhaps the current tires have already been used for some time, and a repair will extend their life by one more year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Let me try to approach it mathematically.\n\nFor the new tires:\n\nTotal cost per tire: $180.\n\nLifetime: 4 years.\n\nAverage cost per year: 180 /4 = $45.\n\nFor the repair option:\n\nTotal cost per tire: $40.\n\nLifetime: 1 additional year, so if the tire is already four years old, it'll last one more year (total of five years). But wait, the problem doesn't specify how old the current tires are. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the repair adds one year to the current tires, making the total lifetime five years from when the repair is done.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the current tires are about to be four years old. So, if you repair them, they'll last for one more year (total of five years). So, the total cost for repair is $40, and they last five years. So, the average cost per year is 40 /5 = $8.\n\nSo, the average cost for new tires is $45 per year, and for repair it's $8 per year. Now, the question is: the average cost of new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing.\n\nWait, that can't be right because $45 is way more than $8. But looking at the options, the choices are 8%, 10%, etc., so perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not considering the correct time frames. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the average cost per year over the tire's life.\n\nWhen you buy new tires, they cost $180 and last four years. So, the average is 180/4 = 45 per year.\n\nWhen you repair, you pay $40 for an additional year, so the total cost is $40 for one extra year. So, perhaps the repair is an alternative to buying new tires, but it's a one-time cost for one more year. So, perhaps the repair is an option that allows the tire to last five years instead of four. So, the total cost would be $40 for five years, which averages to 40/5 = 8 per year.\n\nWait, but that would mean the new tires cost 45 per year, and the repair option averages 8 per year. So, the new tires are more expensive, but the question is asking by what percentage the new tires' average cost is greater than the repair option.\n\nWait, that would mean 45 is how much percent greater than 8. So, the formula is ((45 - 8)/8) * 100%.\n\n45 -8 is 37. 37 /8 is 4.625. 4.625 *100 is 462.5%. But that's not one of the options. So, that can't be right. So, I must have made a mistake in calculating the average cost for the repair option.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not accounting for the fact that the repair is an option for the current tires. So, perhaps the customer is considering whether to replace the current tires now or to repair them once to get an extra year. Let's think of it as two options:\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires now for $180, which will last four years.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires for $40, which will make them last one more year (so, the total life is five years from the current time).\n\nBut wait, the problem states that when purchased new, the tires last four years. So, perhaps the current tires have already been used for four years, and repairing them for $40 would make them last one more year (total of five years). So, the total cost for the repair option is $40, and they last one more year. So, the average cost per year would be 40 /1 = $40 per year for that additional year.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the original tires were already in use. Perhaps I'm complicating it too much. Let me try to restate the problem.\n\nThe problem is: A customer can choose between buying new tires at $180 each, which last four years, or repairing current tires at $40 each, which adds one more year to their life. So, the repair extends the life by one year.\n\nSo, the question is: What is the average cost per year of the new tires compared to the repair option, and by what percentage is it greater.\n\nI think the key is to calculate the average cost per year for each option.\n\nFor new tires: $180 for four years \u2192 average is 180/4 = $45 per year.\n\nFor repair: $40 for one additional year. So, the repair gives an extra year beyond the current state. So, perhaps the current tires are already four years old, and a repair will make them last one more year. So, the total cost for that extra year is $40, making the average cost per year for that one year $40. So, the average cost for the repair option is $40 per year for the extra year.\n\nWait, but if the customer chooses to repair, they're getting an extra year of use. So, perhaps the average cost per year for the repair option is $40 per year over that one year. So, the new tires are $45 per year over four years, and the repair is $40 per year over one year. But wait, that seems like comparing apples to oranges because the time periods are different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the average cost over the entire life of the tire in each scenario. For the new tires, the average is $45 per year over four years. For the repair, the tire's life is extended by one year, so the total life is five years. So, the average cost would be total cost divided by total years.\n\nWait, but when you repair, the tire's life becomes five years, right? So, if you pay $40, how many years does that cover? One year. So, perhaps the total cost for the tire with repair is $40, but it's only for one year, so the average cost is $40 per year for that one year.\n\nBut that doesn't align with the other option. Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the repair is an option to extend the life of the tire beyond four years. So, for the new tire, the average is 45 per year over four years. For the repair, the customer is considering whether to repair instead of buying new. So, perhaps the repair is an alternative to buying new, but let's think in terms of cost per year over the same period.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer is deciding whether to buy new tires now or to repair their current tires, which are about to need replacement. So, if they repair, they can get one more year, but then they would still have to buy new tires after that. So, perhaps the total cost over time is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Let's compute the average cost per year for each option.\n\nNew tires: 180 per tire, 4 years \u2192 180/4 = 45 per year.\n\nRepair: 40 per tire, 1 additional year \u2192 40/1 = 40 per year.\n\nSo, the average cost for new tires is $45, repair is $40. So, the question is, how much greater is 45 than 40 in percentage terms.\n\nWait, no, the question says, \"the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\"\n\nWait, so 45 is what percent greater than 40.\n\nWait, that's a different calculation. So, the increase is 5 (45-40=5). The percentage is (5/40)*100% = 12.5%.\n\nWait, that's one of the options, option C) 12.5%.\n\nBut wait, I'm getting confused again because perhaps the repair is not just for one year but for the entire life.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the repair option. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe repair costs $40 per tire and will make the current tires last for one additional year. So, if the current tires are about to fail (like after four years), repairing them for $40 makes them last one more year, so total five years. So, the total cost for the tire with repair is $40, and it lasts for five years.\n\nWait, but that would mean the average cost per year for the repair option is 40/5 = 8 per year. Then, new tires average 45 per year. So, the increase is (45-8)/8 = 37/8 = 4.625 \u2192 462.5% increase. But that's not one of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is done once, adding one year, so the total life is five years. So, the total cost for the repair option is $40 for five years, which averages to 8 per year.\n\nThen, the new tires cost 45 per year, which is 45/8 = 5.625 times higher. But 45 is 462.5% higher than 8, which isn't an option. So, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair is not adding to the existing life but is an alternative to buying new. So, the customer can choose between:\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires for $180, which last four years. So, average cost 45 per year.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires for $40, which makes them last one more year (so, five years). So, the average cost is 40 /5 = 8 per year.\n\nWait, but that would make the new tires much more expensive. So, 45 compared to 8, which is a 462.5% increase, but the options don't have that. So, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer's current tires are four years old and need to be replaced. The repair is a one-time cost of $40 per tire, which allows the tire to last one more year. So, the total life of the tire after repair is five years. So, the average cost per year would be 40 /5 = 8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is done each year, but that doesn't make sense. The problem says \"a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\"\n\nSo, the repair is a one-time cost of $40, which adds one more year to the tire's life. So, the total life is five years, and the total cost is $40. So, average per year is 8.\n\nSo, new tires average 45 per year, repair option averages 8 per year. So, the question is, 45 is what percent greater than 8?\n\nWait, but the options don't include 462.5%. So, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm considering the wrong time frame. Let me think about the problem again.\n\nThe problem says that when purchased new, the tires last four years. So, if you buy new, you have four years of use for $180. Alternatively, you can repair the current tires for $40, which adds one more year. So, the total life becomes five years for $40.\n\nWait, but that would mean the cost for five years is $40, so average per year is 8.\n\nBut then, the new tires' average is 45 per year for four years. So, the new tires are more expensive, but by how much?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is comparing the average cost per year of the new tires to the average cost per year of the repair option.\n\nSo, 45 (new) vs 8 (repair). So, the new tires are 45, which is (45-8)/8 = 37/8 = 4.625, so 462.5% higher. But that's not an option. So, perhaps I'm not considering the correct setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer is considering the cost for each tire over the same period. For example, if the customer buys new tires, they last four years. If they repair, they get one more year. So, perhaps the customer is comparing the cost for each tire over four years and then the cost for the repair plus one more year.\n\nWait, maybe I should model it as:\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires for $180, which last four years. So, for four years, cost is $180.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires for $40, which makes them last five years. So, for five years, cost is $40.\n\nBut that would mean the average cost per year for option 1 is 45, and for option 2, it's 8. So, the new tires are 45, which is 462.5% higher than 8. But again, not matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the repair is done once, making the tire last one more year. So, the customer would have to buy new tires after that extra year. So, perhaps the total cost for the repair option is $40 plus the cost of new tires after that extra year. But that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the average cost per year only for the period during which the tire is in use. So, for new tires, it's $180 for four years \u2192 45 per year. For the repair, it's $40 for one year \u2192 40 per year. So, the new tires are 45, which is 12.5% higher than 40. Because (45-40)/40 = 5/40 = 0.125 \u2192 12.5%.\n\nWait, that's one of the options, option C)12.5%.\n\nSo, perhaps that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, but why would the repair option be considered only for one year? Because the repair adds one more year. So, the repair is done once, and the tire lasts that extra year. So, the total cost is $40 for that one year.\n\nSo, the average cost per year for the repair option is $40, and for new tires, it's $45. So, the new tires are 45, which is 12.5% more than 40.\n\nSo, that would make the answer 12.5%, which is option C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the intended approach is to compare the two average costs as 45 and 40, leading to a 12.5% increase.\n\nSo, the answer would be C) 12.5%.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the percentage by which the average cost per year of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires, we analyze the two options:\n\n### Option 1: New Tires\n- **Cost per tire**: $180  \n- **Lifetime**: 4 years  \n- **Average cost per year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{180}{4} = 45 \\, \\text{\\$/year}\n  \\]\n\n### Option 2: Repair Current Tires\n- **Repair cost per tire**: $40  \n- **Additional lifetime**: 1 year  \n- **Total lifetime after repair**: 5 years (assuming the tires were already 4 years old before repair)  \n- **Average cost per year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{40}{5} = 8 \\, \\text{\\$/year}\n  \\]\n\n### Comparison\nThe question asks by what percentage the average cost per year of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about tires and their costs. Let me try to wrap my head around it. \n\nAlright, the question is about comparing the average cost per year for new tires versus repairing the current ones. Hmm, I need to find out by what percentage the average cost of new tires is greater than the repair option. \n\nLet me read the problem again. So, when new, the tires last for four years and cost $180 each. Alternatively, you can repair them for $40 each, which extends their life by one more year. So, the repaired tires would last five years instead of four.\n\nWait, the problem says the customer can choose between buying new tires at $180 each or repairing current ones at $40 each for an extra year. So, I think I need to calculate the average cost per year for each option and then find the percentage increase from repair to new.\n\nLet me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, for the new tires. Each tire costs $180 and lasts four years. So the average cost per year would be the total cost divided by the number of years. So that's 180 divided by 4. Let me compute that. 180 /4 is 45. So, the average cost per year for new tires is $45.\n\nNext, the repair option. Each repair is $40 and adds one more year to the tire's life. Wait, so the original life is four years, and repair makes it five. So, the total cost for the repair option is $40 per tire. But wait, wait\u2014does the customer have to pay $40 each time they repair, or is it a one-time repair? Hmm, the wording says \"can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\" So, I think it's a one-time repair cost of $40, which adds one year to the existing four. So, the tires last for five years, costing $40 in total for the repair. But wait, wait\u2014wait, the original tires are already being used. So, the customer is choosing between replacing them now or repairing them once. \n\nWait, no, I think the scenario is that the customer currently has tires that are perhaps four years old, so they need to decide whether to buy new ones or repair the old ones. Or maybe the question is about whether to replace them every four years or repair once to get an extra year. Hmm, perhaps the customer is looking to extend the life of the tires beyond four years, either by replacing or repairing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer is considering whether to buy new tires now or repair their current tires. So, if they buy new, each tire is $180 and lasts four years. If they repair, each tire costs $40 and lasts one more year, making it five years total.\n\nWait, no, I think the customer is looking at their current tires, which are perhaps already in use. So, the customer can either replace them now, paying $180 each for new tires that will last four years, or repair them for $40 each, making the current tires last one more year (so five years total from the repair). So, the total cost for each tire would be either $180 for four years or $40 for five years.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the original tires have already been used for some time. Or perhaps the problem is that when you buy new tires, they last four years, but if you repair, you can get one more year. So, perhaps the question is about the average cost per year over the life of the tires.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as two options: \n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Each tire costs $180 and lasts 4 years. So, the average cost per year is 180 /4 = $45 per year.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires. Each repair is $40, and it adds one year to their life. So, the tires now last 5 years. The total cost is $40, so average per year is 40 /5 = $8 per year.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because if the repair is $40 and the tires last for an additional year, the total life is five years. So, the total cost is $40 for five years. So, average cost per year is 40 /5 = 8.\n\nSo, now, the average cost per year for new tires is $45, and for repair it's $8. Wait, that seems too low. Did I get that right?\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the repair option. Maybe the customer has the option to repair the current tires, which would cost $40 per tire, and this repair will make the current tires last one additional year. So, the current tires, without repair, have some remaining life. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer's current tires are about to need replacement (i.e., after four years). So, the customer can either buy new tires now for $180 each, which will last four years, or repair the current tires for $40 each, which would make them last one more year (so total of five years from when the repair is done).\n\nBut wait, when you repair, you're adding an extra year to the current tires. So, if the current tires have already been used for, say, four years, then a repair would give them one more year. But that would make the life five years in total, but the cost is $40 for that extra year.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the customer is considering whether to repair their current tires, which are still in use, to get an extra year, rather than buying new ones. So, the new tires are a replacement, and the repair is an alternative.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the customer can choose to buy new tires now, which cost $180 each and last four years, or repair their current tires for $40 each, which will extend their life by one year, making the total life five years from the time of repair.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer's current tires are already four years old. So, if they repair them, they'll last one more year. So, the total life would be five years from now. Alternatively, buying new tires now, they'll last four years, so they would need to be replaced again in four years.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is about average cost over the tire's life. So, for new tires, it's $180 for four years. For the repair, it's $40 for an additional year of life. But wait, maybe the repair is in addition to the original cost of the tires. Hmm, but the problem doesn't mention the original cost of the current tires. So, perhaps the problem is assuming that the customer is at the point where their current tires are about to need replacement, and they can either replace them now or repair them.\n\nSo, perhaps the customer is choosing between two options for their current tires:\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires now for $180 each, which will last four years.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires for $40 each, which will make them last one more year (so, five years in total, from the time of purchase of the new tires).\n\nWait, no, because the problem states that the new tires last four years, while the repair makes the current tires last one additional year. So, perhaps the current tires have already been used for some time, and a repair will extend their life by one more year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Let me try to approach it mathematically.\n\nFor the new tires:\n\nTotal cost per tire: $180.\n\nLifetime: 4 years.\n\nAverage cost per year: 180 /4 = $45.\n\nFor the repair option:\n\nTotal cost per tire: $40.\n\nLifetime: 1 additional year, so if the tire is already four years old, it'll last one more year (total of five years). But wait, the problem doesn't specify how old the current tires are. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the repair adds one year to the current tires, making the total lifetime five years from when the repair is done.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the current tires are about to be four years old. So, if you repair them, they'll last for one more year (total of five years). So, the total cost for repair is $40, and they last five years. So, the average cost per year is 40 /5 = $8.\n\nSo, the average cost for new tires is $45 per year, and for repair it's $8 per year. Now, the question is: the average cost of new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing.\n\nWait, that can't be right because $45 is way more than $8. But looking at the options, the choices are 8%, 10%, etc., so perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not considering the correct time frames. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the average cost per year over the tire's life.\n\nWhen you buy new tires, they cost $180 and last four years. So, the average is 180/4 = 45 per year.\n\nWhen you repair, you pay $40 for an additional year, so the total cost is $40 for one extra year. So, perhaps the repair is an alternative to buying new tires, but it's a one-time cost for one more year. So, perhaps the repair is an option that allows the tire to last five years instead of four. So, the total cost would be $40 for five years, which averages to 40/5 = 8 per year.\n\nWait, but that would mean the new tires cost 45 per year, and the repair option averages 8 per year. So, the new tires are more expensive, but the question is asking by what percentage the new tires' average cost is greater than the repair option.\n\nWait, that would mean 45 is how much percent greater than 8. So, the formula is ((45 - 8)/8) * 100%.\n\n45 -8 is 37. 37 /8 is 4.625. 4.625 *100 is 462.5%. But that's not one of the options. So, that can't be right. So, I must have made a mistake in calculating the average cost for the repair option.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not accounting for the fact that the repair is an option for the current tires. So, perhaps the customer is considering whether to replace the current tires now or to repair them once to get an extra year. Let's think of it as two options:\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires now for $180, which will last four years.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires for $40, which will make them last one more year (so, the total life is five years from the current time).\n\nBut wait, the problem states that when purchased new, the tires last four years. So, perhaps the current tires have already been used for four years, and repairing them for $40 would make them last one more year (total of five years). So, the total cost for the repair option is $40, and they last one more year. So, the average cost per year would be 40 /1 = $40 per year for that additional year.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the original tires were already in use. Perhaps I'm complicating it too much. Let me try to restate the problem.\n\nThe problem is: A customer can choose between buying new tires at $180 each, which last four years, or repairing current tires at $40 each, which adds one more year to their life. So, the repair extends the life by one year.\n\nSo, the question is: What is the average cost per year of the new tires compared to the repair option, and by what percentage is it greater.\n\nI think the key is to calculate the average cost per year for each option.\n\nFor new tires: $180 for four years \u2192 average is 180/4 = $45 per year.\n\nFor repair: $40 for one additional year. So, the repair gives an extra year beyond the current state. So, perhaps the current tires are already four years old, and a repair will make them last one more year. So, the total cost for that extra year is $40, making the average cost per year for that one year $40. So, the average cost for the repair option is $40 per year for the extra year.\n\nWait, but if the customer chooses to repair, they're getting an extra year of use. So, perhaps the average cost per year for the repair option is $40 per year over that one year. So, the new tires are $45 per year over four years, and the repair is $40 per year over one year. But wait, that seems like comparing apples to oranges because the time periods are different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the average cost over the entire life of the tire in each scenario. For the new tires, the average is $45 per year over four years. For the repair, the tire's life is extended by one year, so the total life is five years. So, the average cost would be total cost divided by total years.\n\nWait, but when you repair, the tire's life becomes five years, right? So, if you pay $40, how many years does that cover? One year. So, perhaps the total cost for the tire with repair is $40, but it's only for one year, so the average cost is $40 per year for that one year.\n\nBut that doesn't align with the other option. Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the repair is an option to extend the life of the tire beyond four years. So, for the new tire, the average is 45 per year over four years. For the repair, the customer is considering whether to repair instead of buying new. So, perhaps the repair is an alternative to buying new, but let's think in terms of cost per year over the same period.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer is deciding whether to buy new tires now or to repair their current tires, which are about to need replacement. So, if they repair, they can get one more year, but then they would still have to buy new tires after that. So, perhaps the total cost over time is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Let's compute the average cost per year for each option.\n\nNew tires: 180 per tire, 4 years \u2192 180/4 = 45 per year.\n\nRepair: 40 per tire, 1 additional year \u2192 40/1 = 40 per year.\n\nSo, the average cost for new tires is $45, repair is $40. So, the question is, how much greater is 45 than 40 in percentage terms.\n\nWait, no, the question says, \"the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\"\n\nWait, so 45 is what percent greater than 40.\n\nWait, that's a different calculation. So, the increase is 5 (45-40=5). The percentage is (5/40)*100% = 12.5%.\n\nWait, that's one of the options, option C) 12.5%.\n\nBut wait, I'm getting confused again because perhaps the repair is not just for one year but for the entire life.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the repair option. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe repair costs $40 per tire and will make the current tires last for one additional year. So, if the current tires are about to fail (like after four years), repairing them for $40 makes them last one more year, so total five years. So, the total cost for the tire with repair is $40, and it lasts for five years.\n\nWait, but that would mean the average cost per year for the repair option is 40/5 = 8 per year. Then, new tires average 45 per year. So, the increase is (45-8)/8 = 37/8 = 4.625 \u2192 462.5% increase. But that's not one of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is done once, adding one year, so the total life is five years. So, the total cost for the repair option is $40 for five years, which averages to 8 per year.\n\nThen, the new tires cost 45 per year, which is 45/8 = 5.625 times higher. But 45 is 462.5% higher than 8, which isn't an option. So, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair is not adding to the existing life but is an alternative to buying new. So, the customer can choose between:\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires for $180, which last four years. So, average cost 45 per year.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires for $40, which makes them last one more year (so, five years). So, the average cost is 40 /5 = 8 per year.\n\nWait, but that would make the new tires much more expensive. So, 45 compared to 8, which is a 462.5% increase, but the options don't have that. So, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer's current tires are four years old and need to be replaced. The repair is a one-time cost of $40 per tire, which allows the tire to last one more year. So, the total life of the tire after repair is five years. So, the average cost per year would be 40 /5 = 8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is done each year, but that doesn't make sense. The problem says \"a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\"\n\nSo, the repair is a one-time cost of $40, which adds one more year to the tire's life. So, the total life is five years, and the total cost is $40. So, average per year is 8.\n\nSo, new tires average 45 per year, repair option averages 8 per year. So, the question is, 45 is what percent greater than 8?\n\nWait, but the options don't include 462.5%. So, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm considering the wrong time frame. Let me think about the problem again.\n\nThe problem says that when purchased new, the tires last four years. So, if you buy new, you have four years of use for $180. Alternatively, you can repair the current tires for $40, which adds one more year. So, the total life becomes five years for $40.\n\nWait, but that would mean the cost for five years is $40, so average per year is 8.\n\nBut then, the new tires' average is 45 per year for four years. So, the new tires are more expensive, but by how much?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is comparing the average cost per year of the new tires to the average cost per year of the repair option.\n\nSo, 45 (new) vs 8 (repair). So, the new tires are 45, which is (45-8)/8 = 37/8 = 4.625, so 462.5% higher. But that's not an option. So, perhaps I'm not considering the correct setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer is considering the cost for each tire over the same period. For example, if the customer buys new tires, they last four years. If they repair, they get one more year. So, perhaps the customer is comparing the cost for each tire over four years and then the cost for the repair plus one more year.\n\nWait, maybe I should model it as:\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires for $180, which last four years. So, for four years, cost is $180.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires for $40, which makes them last five years. So, for five years, cost is $40.\n\nBut that would mean the average cost per year for option 1 is 45, and for option 2, it's 8. So, the new tires are 45, which is 462.5% higher than 8. But again, not matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the repair is done once, making the tire last one more year. So, the customer would have to buy new tires after that extra year. So, perhaps the total cost for the repair option is $40 plus the cost of new tires after that extra year. But that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the average cost per year only for the period during which the tire is in use. So, for new tires, it's $180 for four years \u2192 45 per year. For the repair, it's $40 for one year \u2192 40 per year. So, the new tires are 45, which is 12.5% higher than 40. Because (45-40)/40 = 5/40 = 0.125 \u2192 12.5%.\n\nWait, that's one of the options, option C)12.5%.\n\nSo, perhaps that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, but why would the repair option be considered only for one year? Because the repair adds one more year. So, the repair is done once, and the tire lasts that extra year. So, the total cost is $40 for that one year.\n\nSo, the average cost per year for the repair option is $40, and for new tires, it's $45. So, the new tires are 45, which is 12.5% more than 40.\n\nSo, that would make the answer 12.5%, which is option C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the intended approach is to compare the two average costs as 45 and 40, leading to a 12.5% increase.\n\nSo, the answer would be C) 12.5%.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage by which the average cost per year of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires, we analyze the two options:\n\n### Option 1: New Tires\n- **Cost per tire**: $180  \n- **Lifetime**: 4 years  \n- **Average cost per year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{180}{4} = 45 \\, \\text{\\$/year}\n  \\]\n\n### Option 2: Repair Current Tires\n- **Repair cost per tire**: $40  \n- **Additional lifetime**: 1 year  \n- **Total lifetime after repair**: 5 years (assuming the tires were already 4 years old before repair)  \n- **Average cost per year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{40}{5} = 8 \\, \\text{\\$/year}\n  \\]\n\n### Comparison\nThe question asks by what percentage the average cost per year of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires. This is calculated as:  \n\\[\n\\text{Percentage increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{New tires average} - \\text{Repair average}}{\\text{Repair average}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:  \n\\[\n\\text{Percentage increase} = \\left( \\frac{45 - 8}{8} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{37}{8} \\right) \\times 100 = 462.5\\%\n\\]\n\nHowever, this result does not match the provided answer choices. Reconsidering the problem, it is likely that the repair option is only for one additional year, making the average cost per year for the repair option:  \n\\[\n\\frac{40}{1} = 40 \\, \\text{\\$/year}\n\\]\n\nNow, recalculate the percentage increase:  \n\\[\n\\text{Percentage increase} = \\left( \\frac{45 - 40}{40} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{5}{40} \\right) \\times 100 = 12.5\\%\n\\]\n\nThis matches one of the provided answer choices. Therefore, the average cost per year of new tires is **12.5% greater** than the cost of repairing the current tires.\n\n**Answer: C**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about tires and costs, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe question says that new tires of a certain brand last for four years when purchased. A customer has two options: buy new tires at $180 each or repair the current tires for $40 each. The repair makes the current tires last one extra year. The question is asking, what's the percentage increase in average cost per year if the customer chooses the new tires compared to repairing?\n\nHmm, so I need to calculate the average cost per year for both options and then find out what percent greater the new tire cost is compared to the repaired one.\n\nLet me break it down.\n\nFirst, for the new tires: each tire costs $180 and lasts four years. So the average cost per year would be total cost divided by the number of years. That's 180 divided by 4. Let me calculate that: 180 / 4 is 45. So the average cost per year is $45.\n\nNow for the repair option. The customer can repair their current tires for $40 each, and this makes the tires last one more year. Wait, so originally, the tires last four years, but with repair, they last five years? Or is it that the repair adds one year, making the total lifespan five years? The question says the repair makes them last for one additional year, so yes, 4 +1 =5 years.\n\nSo the cost for repair is $40 per tire, but since they're repairing their current tires, I'm assuming they only pay $40 once per tire, right? So each tire, when repaired, costs $40 and lasts for five years.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The original tires were already purchased, but now they are being repaired. So the total cost for each tire when repaired is the initial purchase cost plus the repair cost? Or is the repair an alternative to buying new?\n\nWait, the question says the customer can choose to purchase new tires at $180 each or have their current tires repaired at $40 each. So perhaps the current tires are old, and the repair is an alternative to buying new. So perhaps the current tires have already been bought, and the repair is an additional cost. Or maybe the customer is considering whether to buy new or repair, so the initial cost is either 180 or 40.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as two separate options: either buy new tires now, which will last four years, or repair the current tires, which will make them last an extra year (so 5 years total). But I'm not sure about the initial cost of the current tires. Hmm, the problem states that when purchased new, they last four years. But when repaired, the current tires can last an additional year. So the customer's current tires have already been bought, perhaps, and now they need to decide whether to repair them or buy new ones.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it as two scenarios: \n\nOption 1: Buy new tires for $180 each. They last four years.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires for $40 each, making them last one more year (so 5 years).\n\nWe need to find the average cost per year for each option.\n\nFor option 1, the average cost per year is 180 /4 = 45, as I calculated before.\n\nFor option 2, the cost is 40 per tire, and the lifespan is 5 years. So average cost per year is 40 /5 =8.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Because the repair is an additional cost, but maybe the current tires were already purchased. So if the customer already bought the tires, the initial cost is already spent. But the problem is phrased as a choice: purchase new or repair. So perhaps the customer is considering whether to spend $180 now for new tires that will last four years, or spend $40 now to repair the current tires, which will last one more year (so total five years from when they were new? Or four plus one? Hmm, maybe the current tires have already been used for some time, but the problem isn't clear on that.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are already four years old, and the customer is deciding whether to repair them for another year. Because if they buy new tires, they'll last four years. So in that case, the total lifespan with repair would be five years, but the repair is only an extra year beyond the original four.\n\nWait, maybe I should model it as:\n\nIf the customer buys new tires now, they will last four years, so the total lifespan is four years, with a cost of $180.\n\nIf the customer repairs the current tires, they can use them for one more year (so total of five years, perhaps?), but the repair cost is $40.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the current tires can be repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\" So, if the current tires have already been in use for some time, perhaps the remaining lifespan without repair is less than four years. But the problem doesn't specify how old the current tires are. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the original tires have already been purchased and are now four years old. So without repair, they would last four years, but with repair, they last one more year, making it five years. So the repair adds one year to the current lifespan.\n\nBut if the current tires are already four years old, and the repair makes them last for one more year, then the total lifespan is five years. So the cost is $40 per tire for that extra year.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the customer is considering whether to buy new tires (which would last four years) or repair the existing ones for $40 each, which would make them last one more year beyond their current lifespan. But the problem states that the original tires, when purchased new, last four years. So perhaps the current tires are already four years old, and without repair, they would last four years. But if you repair them, they last one additional year, so five years total.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's ignore the current state of the tires and just think about the two options.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Each tire costs $180, lasts four years. So average cost per year is 180 /4 =45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires for $40 each, making them last one additional year. So if the current tires are about to fail, perhaps the repair extends their life by one year, so they last five years total (assuming they were going to last four without repair).\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify the initial lifespan of the current tires. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the current tires have already been in use for some time. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's model it as the repair giving the current tires an additional year beyond what they would have had.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to model the average cost per year for each option, regardless of the prior use.\n\nWait, the problem says, the customer can choose to buy new tires at $180 each, which last four years. Or repair the current tires for $40 each, which makes them last one additional year. So perhaps the current tires are already in use, and the repair allows them to last an extra year beyond their original lifespan.\n\nWait, maybe the current tires were purchased and have already been in use for, say, four years, and without repair, they would last another year, but with repair, they can last another year. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires are already in use for some time, but the problem doesn't specify. So maybe the repair adds one year to the current lifespan.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is implying that the current tires have a certain remaining life, and the repair extends that by one year. But since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps I should assume that the current tires are new. But that can't be, because if they're new, you wouldn't repair them unless they had a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply comparing two options without considering the prior use of the tires. Let me try to see.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Cost: $180, lifespan: 4 years. So average cost per year: 180/4=45.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires. Cost: $40, lifespan: 1 additional year. Wait, does that mean the lifespan becomes 4 +1 =5 years? Or does it mean the lifespan is 1 year? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, the question says, \"a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\" So if the current tires were going to last, say, x years without repair, the repair makes them last x +1 years. But without knowing x, perhaps the original lifespan is four years, so the repair adds one year, making it five.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires have been in use for four years, and without repair, they would last one more year. But the repair makes them last two more years? No, the question says one additional year.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the current tires have been used for four years and are now being considered for repair. Without repair, they would last one more year, but with repair, they last two more years? That might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires are not yet four years old, and the repair extends their lifespan by one year beyond what they would have had. But without knowing the current age, it's hard to model.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach it another way. The question is about the average cost per year. So for each option, I need to calculate the cost per year.\n\nOption 1: New tires cost $180, last four years. So average cost is 180/4 = 45 per year.\n\nOption 2: Repairing current tires costs $40, and the lifespan is increased by one year. So if the current tires were to last, say, t years, they now last t+1 years. But the problem says when purchased new, the tires last four years. So perhaps the current tires are new, and the repair extends their life beyond four years. But that doesn't make sense because new tires are already four-year lifespan.\n\nWait, maybe the repair is an alternative to buying new. So, if I buy new, I get four years for 180. If I repair, I pay 40 and get one more year beyond the current lifespan. But what's the current lifespan? If the current tires are already four years old, then perhaps the repair allows them to last one more year, making the total lifespan five years. But then the average cost per year would be 40 /1 =40 per year, but that's not correct because the total lifespan is five years, but the cost is 40.\n\nWait, let me think. Suppose the current tires are about to fail after four years. Without repair, they last four years. With repair, they last one more year, so five years.\n\nSo the cost for repair is 40, and lifespan is five years. So average cost per year is 40 /5 =8.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the initial cost of the current tires isn't considered. Because if the current tires were already bought, their cost is a sunk cost. So the repair is an additional cost of 40 for an extra year.\n\nBut the problem says the customer can choose to buy new tires at 180 or have current tires repaired at 40. So perhaps the customer is deciding between buying new tires (cost 180, lifespan 4 years) or repairing the current tires (cost 40, lifespan 1 year? Or 5 years? Hmm.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting stuck on the initial lifespan of the current tires. Let me try to model it as if the customer is at a point where they need to decide between two options, and the current tires are in a state where they can be repaired or replaced.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Cost: 180. Lifespan: 4 years. So average cost per year: 180/4=45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires. Cost:40. Lifespan: 1 additional year. So perhaps the current tires have already been used for some time, but the problem doesn't specify. Alternatively, the repair extends the lifespan by one year beyond their original four years, making it five.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are already four years old, and without repair, they would last one more year. But with repair, they last two more years. Or perhaps the repair gives them an additional year beyond their original four, making it five.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair makes them last one year in total. That can't be, because if the tires are new, they wouldn't need repair.\n\nI think the confusion comes from whether the repair extends the current lifespan by one year or makes them last one more year beyond what they would have without repair.\n\nWait, the question says, \"a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\" So the repair adds one year to their current lifespan.\n\nSo if the current tires are about to fail, and without repair they would last zero more years, then the repair makes them last one year. But that's not a realistic scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires are already in use, and the repair extends their lifespan by one year beyond what they would have had.\n\nWait, perhaps the best way is to model the average cost per year for each option, regardless of the current state.\n\nOption 1: New tires. Cost 180, last 4 years. So average cost is 45/year.\n\nOption 2: Repair. Cost 40, and the lifespan is 1 year? No, that can't be. Because why repair for 40 if it only lasts a year? Or perhaps the repair makes the current tires last one additional year beyond their previous lifespan.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair extends the lifespan by one year, making the total lifespan five years (if the current tires were new and would have lasted four, but that doesn't make sense because new tires don't need repair.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is intended to model the repair as giving one additional year beyond the original four, so the total lifespan is five years. So the average cost per year for repair is 40 /5 =8.\n\nIf that's the case, then the average cost per year for new tires is 45, and for repair is 8.\n\nWait, but 45 is the cost for new, and 8 is the cost for repair. So the question is, what's the percentage increase from repair to new.\n\nWait, the question says, \"the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\" So it's (new - repair) / repair *100.\n\nSo (45 -8)/8 *100 = (37)/8 *100 =4.625 *100=462.5%. That can't be right because the options don't include that.\n\nWait, that can't be correct. There's a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the average cost for the repair option. Let me think again.\n\nIf the customer repairs the current tires for $40, and this repair makes the tires last one additional year. So perhaps the current tires are already in use, and without repair, they would last, say, x years. With repair, they last x+1 years. But the problem says when purchased new, they last four years. So perhaps the current tires are four years old, and without repair, they would last one more year. So with repair, they last two more years. Or maybe the repair adds one year beyond their original four, making them last five years.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair adds one year to the current lifespan, which is four years, making it five years.\n\nSo the cost is 40 for five years. So average cost per year is 40 /5 =8.\n\nWait, but if the current tires are four years old and without repair, they would last one more year, then the lifespan with repair is five years. So the cost is 40 for five years. So 40/5=8.\n\nSo option 1: 45/year.\n\nOption 2:8/year.\n\nSo the new tires are more expensive. The question is, by what percentage is the new tire's average cost per year greater than the repair cost.\n\nSo the formula is [(new - repair)/repair] *100.\n\nSo (45-8)/8 = 37/8=4.625. Multiply by 100 gives 462.5%.\n\nBut none of the options are that high. The options are 8%, 10%, 12.5%, etc. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the average cost for the repair option. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair isn't adding to the lifespan but making it last for an additional year beyond what it would have been without repair. For example, the current tires are about to fail, and without repair, they would last zero more years. With repair, they last one year. So the cost is 40 for one year. Then the average cost per year is 40, which is higher than 45, which can't be because the options suggest the new is more expensive.\n\nNo, that can't be right because then the repair would be more expensive per year, but the options suggest the new is more expensive.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think of each option's total cost and lifespan.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Cost: $180, lifespan:4 years. So for four years, you pay 180. So average cost per year is 45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires. Cost: $40, lifespan:1 additional year. So if the current tires were going to last, say, x years, they now last x+1 years. But without knowing x, perhaps the original lifespan is four years, so with repair, they last five. So the cost is 40, and lifespan is five.\n\nSo average cost per year is 40/5=8.\n\nSo new tires have an average cost of 45, repair has 8. So the new is more expensive by (45-8)=37.\n\nSo the percentage increase is (37/8)*100=462.5%. But none of the options are that high. So I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair cost is per tire, and the lifespan is one additional year beyond the original four. So if you have four tires, each repair is 40, making each last five years.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it per tire. Let's say you have four tires. If you buy new, each costs 180, lasts four years. So for four years, you have four tires. The average cost per year per tire is 180/4=45.\n\nIf you repair the current tires, each repair is 40, and each tire lasts one more year. So each tire now lasts five years. So the average cost per year per tire is 40/5=8.\n\nSo the new tires are 45, repair is 8. So the increase is (45-8)/8=37/8=4.625, which is 462.5% higher.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the customer has the option to either buy new tires (which last four years) or repair their current tires, which would make the current tires last one more year. So the repair is an option when the tires are about to fail. So the repair cost is 40, and the lifespan is one more year. So the average cost per year for repair is 40/1=40.\n\nBut then the new tires have an average of 45, repair has 40. So the new is 5 higher than repair. So (5/40)*100=12.5%. That's option C.\n\nHmm, but that makes sense. Because if the repair only gives one more year, then the average cost for repair is 40 per year for that one year. So for the same period, the new tires have an average of 45. So the difference is 5, which is 12.5% of 40.\n\nBut wait, why would the repair only last one year? The problem says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So perhaps the current tires were about to last one year without repair, and with repair, they last two years. Or perhaps the repair makes them last one year beyond their current lifespan.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires have already been in use for four years, and without repair, they would last one more year. So the repair makes them last two more years. So the total lifespan is five years, but the cost is 40. So average cost per year is 40/5=8. Then new is 45, which is much higher.\n\nBut the options don't have 462.5%, so maybe I'm wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair makes the current tires last for an additional year beyond their original four years, making them last five years. So the repair cost is 40, and the lifespan is five years. So average is 8 per year.\n\nBut that leads to the same problem as before.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the cost in terms of the time period. Let's say the customer is looking to cover a certain period, say four years.\n\nIf they buy new tires, they pay 180, and the tires last four years. So cost per year is 45.\n\nIf they repair, they pay 40, and the tires last one more year. So to cover four years, they would need to repair four times? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair extends the current tires' life by one year, so if the customer needs tires for five years, they can repair once. But the problem isn't clear on the timeline.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is done once, and the tires last one additional year. So if the customer buys the repair, they can get one more year of use. So the cost is 40 for one year. So the average cost per year is 40.\n\nWait, but then the new tires are 45, which is a 12.5% increase over 40. So the answer would be C)12.5%.\n\nBut that would be the case only if the repair gives one year of use for 40, making the average cost 40/year. Then new is 45, which is 5 more. 5/40=0.125, which is 12.5%.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Because the problem says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year, which implies the lifespan is extended by one year beyond what it would have been.\n\nSo if the current tires are about to last one more year without repair, the repair makes them last two years. So the average cost per year for repair is 40/2=20.\n\nWait, that would make the new tires' average 45 vs repair's 20. Then the increase is (25/20)=1.25=125%.\n\nBut that's not an option either.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair makes the tires last one additional year beyond their original four, so five years. So average cost per year is 40/5=8.\n\nNew is 45. So (45-8)/8=4.625=462.5% increase. But that's not an option.\n\nHmm. I'm getting stuck. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem says when purchased new, tires last four years. So the new tires' average is 45/year.\n\nThe repair option is to repair the current tires for 40, which makes them last one additional year. So perhaps the current tires have already been in use for some time, and the repair extends their lifespan by one year.\n\nIf the current tires were about to last, say, three years without repair, then with repair, they last four years. So the cost is 40, and lifespan is four years. So average is 10 per year.\n\nThen new is 45, repair is 10. So the increase is (35/10)=3.5=350%. Not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires have been in use for four years, and the repair makes them last one more year, so five years. So average is 8 per year.\n\nNew is 45, so (45-8)/8=4.625=462.5% increase.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So I must have made a mistake in interpreting the repair's effect.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair doesn't add to the lifespan but makes the tires last for one additional year beyond what they would have had without repair. So if the current tires are new, and without repair, they would last four years, but with repair, they last five years. So the repair cost is 40 for five years. So average is 8.\n\nThen new is 45, repair is 8. So the increase is (37/8)=4.625=462.5%.\n\nBut again, the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair is done each year. Like, every year you pay 40 to extend the tire's life by one year. So for four years, you pay 40 each year, totaling 160. So average cost per year is 160/4=40.\n\nBut new tires cost 180 for four years, average 45. So the new is 12.5% more than 40.\n\nThat would make sense. Because 45 is 12.5% higher than 40.\n\nSo the answer would be 12.5%, option C.\n\nBut why would the repair be done every year? The question says \"a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\" So it's a one-time repair that adds one year.\n\nSo perhaps the repair is done once, adding one year. So the customer can choose to buy new (45/year) or repair once (cost 40, lifespan increased by one year).\n\nWait, but if the customer chooses to repair, how many years of use do they get?\n\nIf the customer's tires are about to fail, and they repair them for 40, making them last one more year, then the total lifespan is one year. So the average cost is 40.\n\nSo new is 45, which is 5 more. 5/40=12.5% increase.\n\nSo the answer is C)12.5%.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Another way: perhaps the repair is done each year, extending each year's lifespan. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is done once, giving an additional year beyond the original four. So the total lifespan is five years, average cost 40/5=8.\n\nBut then the new tires are 45, which is much higher.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct interpretation is that the repair is done once, giving one additional year, making the total lifespan one year, so average cost is 40.\n\nSo the new tires' average is 45, which is 12.5% higher than 40.\n\nSo the answer is C.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the percentage increase in the average cost per year of new tires compared to repairing the current tires, we analyze the two options:\n\n### Option 1: New Tires\n- **Cost**: $180 per tire  \n- **Lifespan**: 4 years  \n- **Average Cost per Year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{180}{4} = 45 \\, \\text{\\$/year}\n  \\]\n\n### Option 2: Repairing Current Tires\n- **Cost**: $40 per tire  \n- **Additional Lifespan**: 1 year  \n- **Interpretation**: The repair extends the current tires' lifespan by 1 year.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about tires and costs, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe question says that new tires of a certain brand last for four years when purchased. A customer has two options: buy new tires at $180 each or repair the current tires for $40 each. The repair makes the current tires last one extra year. The question is asking, what's the percentage increase in average cost per year if the customer chooses the new tires compared to repairing?\n\nHmm, so I need to calculate the average cost per year for both options and then find out what percent greater the new tire cost is compared to the repaired one.\n\nLet me break it down.\n\nFirst, for the new tires: each tire costs $180 and lasts four years. So the average cost per year would be total cost divided by the number of years. That's 180 divided by 4. Let me calculate that: 180 / 4 is 45. So the average cost per year is $45.\n\nNow for the repair option. The customer can repair their current tires for $40 each, and this makes the tires last one more year. Wait, so originally, the tires last four years, but with repair, they last five years? Or is it that the repair adds one year, making the total lifespan five years? The question says the repair makes them last for one additional year, so yes, 4 +1 =5 years.\n\nSo the cost for repair is $40 per tire, but since they're repairing their current tires, I'm assuming they only pay $40 once per tire, right? So each tire, when repaired, costs $40 and lasts for five years.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The original tires were already purchased, but now they are being repaired. So the total cost for each tire when repaired is the initial purchase cost plus the repair cost? Or is the repair an alternative to buying new?\n\nWait, the question says the customer can choose to purchase new tires at $180 each or have their current tires repaired at $40 each. So perhaps the current tires are old, and the repair is an alternative to buying new. So perhaps the current tires have already been bought, and the repair is an additional cost. Or maybe the customer is considering whether to buy new or repair, so the initial cost is either 180 or 40.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as two separate options: either buy new tires now, which will last four years, or repair the current tires, which will make them last an extra year (so 5 years total). But I'm not sure about the initial cost of the current tires. Hmm, the problem states that when purchased new, they last four years. But when repaired, the current tires can last an additional year. So the customer's current tires have already been bought, perhaps, and now they need to decide whether to repair them or buy new ones.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it as two scenarios: \n\nOption 1: Buy new tires for $180 each. They last four years.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires for $40 each, making them last one more year (so 5 years).\n\nWe need to find the average cost per year for each option.\n\nFor option 1, the average cost per year is 180 /4 = 45, as I calculated before.\n\nFor option 2, the cost is 40 per tire, and the lifespan is 5 years. So average cost per year is 40 /5 =8.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Because the repair is an additional cost, but maybe the current tires were already purchased. So if the customer already bought the tires, the initial cost is already spent. But the problem is phrased as a choice: purchase new or repair. So perhaps the customer is considering whether to spend $180 now for new tires that will last four years, or spend $40 now to repair the current tires, which will last one more year (so total five years from when they were new? Or four plus one? Hmm, maybe the current tires have already been used for some time, but the problem isn't clear on that.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are already four years old, and the customer is deciding whether to repair them for another year. Because if they buy new tires, they'll last four years. So in that case, the total lifespan with repair would be five years, but the repair is only an extra year beyond the original four.\n\nWait, maybe I should model it as:\n\nIf the customer buys new tires now, they will last four years, so the total lifespan is four years, with a cost of $180.\n\nIf the customer repairs the current tires, they can use them for one more year (so total of five years, perhaps?), but the repair cost is $40.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the current tires can be repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\" So, if the current tires have already been in use for some time, perhaps the remaining lifespan without repair is less than four years. But the problem doesn't specify how old the current tires are. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the original tires have already been purchased and are now four years old. So without repair, they would last four years, but with repair, they last one more year, making it five years. So the repair adds one year to the current lifespan.\n\nBut if the current tires are already four years old, and the repair makes them last for one more year, then the total lifespan is five years. So the cost is $40 per tire for that extra year.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the customer is considering whether to buy new tires (which would last four years) or repair the existing ones for $40 each, which would make them last one more year beyond their current lifespan. But the problem states that the original tires, when purchased new, last four years. So perhaps the current tires are already four years old, and without repair, they would last four years. But if you repair them, they last one additional year, so five years total.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's ignore the current state of the tires and just think about the two options.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Each tire costs $180, lasts four years. So average cost per year is 180 /4 =45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires for $40 each, making them last one additional year. So if the current tires are about to fail, perhaps the repair extends their life by one year, so they last five years total (assuming they were going to last four without repair).\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify the initial lifespan of the current tires. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the current tires have already been in use for some time. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's model it as the repair giving the current tires an additional year beyond what they would have had.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to model the average cost per year for each option, regardless of the prior use.\n\nWait, the problem says, the customer can choose to buy new tires at $180 each, which last four years. Or repair the current tires for $40 each, which makes them last one additional year. So perhaps the current tires are already in use, and the repair allows them to last an extra year beyond their original lifespan.\n\nWait, maybe the current tires were purchased and have already been in use for, say, four years, and without repair, they would last another year, but with repair, they can last another year. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires are already in use for some time, but the problem doesn't specify. So maybe the repair adds one year to the current lifespan.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is implying that the current tires have a certain remaining life, and the repair extends that by one year. But since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps I should assume that the current tires are new. But that can't be, because if they're new, you wouldn't repair them unless they had a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply comparing two options without considering the prior use of the tires. Let me try to see.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Cost: $180, lifespan: 4 years. So average cost per year: 180/4=45.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires. Cost: $40, lifespan: 1 additional year. Wait, does that mean the lifespan becomes 4 +1 =5 years? Or does it mean the lifespan is 1 year? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, the question says, \"a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\" So if the current tires were going to last, say, x years without repair, the repair makes them last x +1 years. But without knowing x, perhaps the original lifespan is four years, so the repair adds one year, making it five.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires have been in use for four years, and without repair, they would last one more year. But the repair makes them last two more years? No, the question says one additional year.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the current tires have been used for four years and are now being considered for repair. Without repair, they would last one more year, but with repair, they last two more years? That might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires are not yet four years old, and the repair extends their lifespan by one year beyond what they would have had. But without knowing the current age, it's hard to model.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach it another way. The question is about the average cost per year. So for each option, I need to calculate the cost per year.\n\nOption 1: New tires cost $180, last four years. So average cost is 180/4 = 45 per year.\n\nOption 2: Repairing current tires costs $40, and the lifespan is increased by one year. So if the current tires were to last, say, t years, they now last t+1 years. But the problem says when purchased new, the tires last four years. So perhaps the current tires are new, and the repair extends their life beyond four years. But that doesn't make sense because new tires are already four-year lifespan.\n\nWait, maybe the repair is an alternative to buying new. So, if I buy new, I get four years for 180. If I repair, I pay 40 and get one more year beyond the current lifespan. But what's the current lifespan? If the current tires are already four years old, then perhaps the repair allows them to last one more year, making the total lifespan five years. But then the average cost per year would be 40 /1 =40 per year, but that's not correct because the total lifespan is five years, but the cost is 40.\n\nWait, let me think. Suppose the current tires are about to fail after four years. Without repair, they last four years. With repair, they last one more year, so five years.\n\nSo the cost for repair is 40, and lifespan is five years. So average cost per year is 40 /5 =8.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the initial cost of the current tires isn't considered. Because if the current tires were already bought, their cost is a sunk cost. So the repair is an additional cost of 40 for an extra year.\n\nBut the problem says the customer can choose to buy new tires at 180 or have current tires repaired at 40. So perhaps the customer is deciding between buying new tires (cost 180, lifespan 4 years) or repairing the current tires (cost 40, lifespan 1 year? Or 5 years? Hmm.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting stuck on the initial lifespan of the current tires. Let me try to model it as if the customer is at a point where they need to decide between two options, and the current tires are in a state where they can be repaired or replaced.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Cost: 180. Lifespan: 4 years. So average cost per year: 180/4=45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires. Cost:40. Lifespan: 1 additional year. So perhaps the current tires have already been used for some time, but the problem doesn't specify. Alternatively, the repair extends the lifespan by one year beyond their original four years, making it five.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are already four years old, and without repair, they would last one more year. But with repair, they last two more years. Or perhaps the repair gives them an additional year beyond their original four, making it five.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair makes them last one year in total. That can't be, because if the tires are new, they wouldn't need repair.\n\nI think the confusion comes from whether the repair extends the current lifespan by one year or makes them last one more year beyond what they would have without repair.\n\nWait, the question says, \"a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\" So the repair adds one year to their current lifespan.\n\nSo if the current tires are about to fail, and without repair they would last zero more years, then the repair makes them last one year. But that's not a realistic scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires are already in use, and the repair extends their lifespan by one year beyond what they would have had.\n\nWait, perhaps the best way is to model the average cost per year for each option, regardless of the current state.\n\nOption 1: New tires. Cost 180, last 4 years. So average cost is 45/year.\n\nOption 2: Repair. Cost 40, and the lifespan is 1 year? No, that can't be. Because why repair for 40 if it only lasts a year? Or perhaps the repair makes the current tires last one additional year beyond their previous lifespan.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair extends the lifespan by one year, making the total lifespan five years (if the current tires were new and would have lasted four, but that doesn't make sense because new tires don't need repair.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is intended to model the repair as giving one additional year beyond the original four, so the total lifespan is five years. So the average cost per year for repair is 40 /5 =8.\n\nIf that's the case, then the average cost per year for new tires is 45, and for repair is 8.\n\nWait, but 45 is the cost for new, and 8 is the cost for repair. So the question is, what's the percentage increase from repair to new.\n\nWait, the question says, \"the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\" So it's (new - repair) / repair *100.\n\nSo (45 -8)/8 *100 = (37)/8 *100 =4.625 *100=462.5%. That can't be right because the options don't include that.\n\nWait, that can't be correct. There's a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the average cost for the repair option. Let me think again.\n\nIf the customer repairs the current tires for $40, and this repair makes the tires last one additional year. So perhaps the current tires are already in use, and without repair, they would last, say, x years. With repair, they last x+1 years. But the problem says when purchased new, they last four years. So perhaps the current tires are four years old, and without repair, they would last one more year. So with repair, they last two more years. Or maybe the repair adds one year beyond their original four, making them last five years.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair adds one year to the current lifespan, which is four years, making it five years.\n\nSo the cost is 40 for five years. So average cost per year is 40 /5 =8.\n\nWait, but if the current tires are four years old and without repair, they would last one more year, then the lifespan with repair is five years. So the cost is 40 for five years. So 40/5=8.\n\nSo option 1: 45/year.\n\nOption 2:8/year.\n\nSo the new tires are more expensive. The question is, by what percentage is the new tire's average cost per year greater than the repair cost.\n\nSo the formula is [(new - repair)/repair] *100.\n\nSo (45-8)/8 = 37/8=4.625. Multiply by 100 gives 462.5%.\n\nBut none of the options are that high. The options are 8%, 10%, 12.5%, etc. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the average cost for the repair option. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair isn't adding to the lifespan but making it last for an additional year beyond what it would have been without repair. For example, the current tires are about to fail, and without repair, they would last zero more years. With repair, they last one year. So the cost is 40 for one year. Then the average cost per year is 40, which is higher than 45, which can't be because the options suggest the new is more expensive.\n\nNo, that can't be right because then the repair would be more expensive per year, but the options suggest the new is more expensive.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think of each option's total cost and lifespan.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Cost: $180, lifespan:4 years. So for four years, you pay 180. So average cost per year is 45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires. Cost: $40, lifespan:1 additional year. So if the current tires were going to last, say, x years, they now last x+1 years. But without knowing x, perhaps the original lifespan is four years, so with repair, they last five. So the cost is 40, and lifespan is five.\n\nSo average cost per year is 40/5=8.\n\nSo new tires have an average cost of 45, repair has 8. So the new is more expensive by (45-8)=37.\n\nSo the percentage increase is (37/8)*100=462.5%. But none of the options are that high. So I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair cost is per tire, and the lifespan is one additional year beyond the original four. So if you have four tires, each repair is 40, making each last five years.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it per tire. Let's say you have four tires. If you buy new, each costs 180, lasts four years. So for four years, you have four tires. The average cost per year per tire is 180/4=45.\n\nIf you repair the current tires, each repair is 40, and each tire lasts one more year. So each tire now lasts five years. So the average cost per year per tire is 40/5=8.\n\nSo the new tires are 45, repair is 8. So the increase is (45-8)/8=37/8=4.625, which is 462.5% higher.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the customer has the option to either buy new tires (which last four years) or repair their current tires, which would make the current tires last one more year. So the repair is an option when the tires are about to fail. So the repair cost is 40, and the lifespan is one more year. So the average cost per year for repair is 40/1=40.\n\nBut then the new tires have an average of 45, repair has 40. So the new is 5 higher than repair. So (5/40)*100=12.5%. That's option C.\n\nHmm, but that makes sense. Because if the repair only gives one more year, then the average cost for repair is 40 per year for that one year. So for the same period, the new tires have an average of 45. So the difference is 5, which is 12.5% of 40.\n\nBut wait, why would the repair only last one year? The problem says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So perhaps the current tires were about to last one year without repair, and with repair, they last two years. Or perhaps the repair makes them last one year beyond their current lifespan.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires have already been in use for four years, and without repair, they would last one more year. So the repair makes them last two more years. So the total lifespan is five years, but the cost is 40. So average cost per year is 40/5=8. Then new is 45, which is much higher.\n\nBut the options don't have 462.5%, so maybe I'm wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair makes the current tires last for an additional year beyond their original four years, making them last five years. So the repair cost is 40, and the lifespan is five years. So average is 8 per year.\n\nBut that leads to the same problem as before.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the cost in terms of the time period. Let's say the customer is looking to cover a certain period, say four years.\n\nIf they buy new tires, they pay 180, and the tires last four years. So cost per year is 45.\n\nIf they repair, they pay 40, and the tires last one more year. So to cover four years, they would need to repair four times? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair extends the current tires' life by one year, so if the customer needs tires for five years, they can repair once. But the problem isn't clear on the timeline.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is done once, and the tires last one additional year. So if the customer buys the repair, they can get one more year of use. So the cost is 40 for one year. So the average cost per year is 40.\n\nWait, but then the new tires are 45, which is a 12.5% increase over 40. So the answer would be C)12.5%.\n\nBut that would be the case only if the repair gives one year of use for 40, making the average cost 40/year. Then new is 45, which is 5 more. 5/40=0.125, which is 12.5%.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Because the problem says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year, which implies the lifespan is extended by one year beyond what it would have been.\n\nSo if the current tires are about to last one more year without repair, the repair makes them last two years. So the average cost per year for repair is 40/2=20.\n\nWait, that would make the new tires' average 45 vs repair's 20. Then the increase is (25/20)=1.25=125%.\n\nBut that's not an option either.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair makes the tires last one additional year beyond their original four, so five years. So average cost per year is 40/5=8.\n\nNew is 45. So (45-8)/8=4.625=462.5% increase. But that's not an option.\n\nHmm. I'm getting stuck. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem says when purchased new, tires last four years. So the new tires' average is 45/year.\n\nThe repair option is to repair the current tires for 40, which makes them last one additional year. So perhaps the current tires have already been in use for some time, and the repair extends their lifespan by one year.\n\nIf the current tires were about to last, say, three years without repair, then with repair, they last four years. So the cost is 40, and lifespan is four years. So average is 10 per year.\n\nThen new is 45, repair is 10. So the increase is (35/10)=3.5=350%. Not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires have been in use for four years, and the repair makes them last one more year, so five years. So average is 8 per year.\n\nNew is 45, so (45-8)/8=4.625=462.5% increase.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So I must have made a mistake in interpreting the repair's effect.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair doesn't add to the lifespan but makes the tires last for one additional year beyond what they would have had without repair. So if the current tires are new, and without repair, they would last four years, but with repair, they last five years. So the repair cost is 40 for five years. So average is 8.\n\nThen new is 45, repair is 8. So the increase is (37/8)=4.625=462.5%.\n\nBut again, the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair is done each year. Like, every year you pay 40 to extend the tire's life by one year. So for four years, you pay 40 each year, totaling 160. So average cost per year is 160/4=40.\n\nBut new tires cost 180 for four years, average 45. So the new is 12.5% more than 40.\n\nThat would make sense. Because 45 is 12.5% higher than 40.\n\nSo the answer would be 12.5%, option C.\n\nBut why would the repair be done every year? The question says \"a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\" So it's a one-time repair that adds one year.\n\nSo perhaps the repair is done once, adding one year. So the customer can choose to buy new (45/year) or repair once (cost 40, lifespan increased by one year).\n\nWait, but if the customer chooses to repair, how many years of use do they get?\n\nIf the customer's tires are about to fail, and they repair them for 40, making them last one more year, then the total lifespan is one year. So the average cost is 40.\n\nSo new is 45, which is 5 more. 5/40=12.5% increase.\n\nSo the answer is C)12.5%.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Another way: perhaps the repair is done each year, extending each year's lifespan. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is done once, giving an additional year beyond the original four. So the total lifespan is five years, average cost 40/5=8.\n\nBut then the new tires are 45, which is much higher.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct interpretation is that the repair is done once, giving one additional year, making the total lifespan one year, so average cost is 40.\n\nSo the new tires' average is 45, which is 12.5% higher than 40.\n\nSo the answer is C.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage increase in the average cost per year of new tires compared to repairing the current tires, we analyze the two options:\n\n### Option 1: New Tires\n- **Cost**: $180 per tire  \n- **Lifespan**: 4 years  \n- **Average Cost per Year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{180}{4} = 45 \\, \\text{\\$/year}\n  \\]\n\n### Option 2: Repairing Current Tires\n- **Cost**: $40 per tire  \n- **Additional Lifespan**: 1 year  \n- **Interpretation**: The repair extends the current tires' lifespan by 1 year. If the tires are about to fail, the repair allows them to last for **1 additional year**.  \n- **Average Cost per Year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{40}{1} = 40 \\, \\text{\\$/year}\n  \\]\n\n### Percentage Increase in Cost\nThe question asks for the percentage increase in the average cost per year of new tires compared to repairing the current tires. Using the formula:  \n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{New Cost} - \\text{Repair Cost}}{\\text{Repair Cost}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:  \n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{45 - 40}{40} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{5}{40} \\right) \\times 100 = 12.5\\%\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe average cost per year of new tires is **12.5% greater** than the cost of repairing the current tires.  \n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about tires and their costs over time. Hmm, let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question says that new tires of a certain brand last for four years. A customer can either buy new tires at $180 each or repair their current tires for $40 each, which extends their life by one additional year. The question is asking about the average cost per year for the new tires compared to the repaired ones, and specifically, by what percentage the new tires' average cost is greater.\n\nWait, I need to find the percentage increase from the repaired tires' cost to the new tires' cost on an annual basis.\n\nLet me break this down. First, I should calculate the average cost per year for both options.\n\nStarting with the new tires: each tire costs $180 and lasts four years. So the average cost per year would be the total cost divided by the number of years. That would be 180 divided by 4. Let me compute that: 180 /4 is 45. So each year, the new tire costs $45 on average.\n\nNow for the repaired tires: the customer can repair each tire for $40, which adds one more year to its life. Wait, but how long does the tire last before repair? The problem says when purchased new, they last four years. So if someone repairs them, I'm assuming they're using their current tires, which are already a few years old, but I think the problem might be simplifying it. Let me read again. Oh, the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So if the tires were going to last, say, three years without repair, then the repair adds one more, making it four years. Or wait, perhaps the initial lifetime is four years, and the repair extends that by one, making it five? Or maybe the customer is choosing between buying new (four years) or repairing current ones, which would last one more year beyond their current lifespan. Hmm, perhaps I should think of the initial state.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer is considering whether to replace or repair. Let's think of the current tires: if they repair them, they get one more year. So, how long do the current tires last without repair? Well, when you buy new, they last four years. So perhaps the customer has used them for a few years already, but I think the problem is more straightforward. Let me consider that the current tires have been used for a certain time, but when repaired, they last one more year. Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the customer can either buy new tires (cost $180 each, last four years) or repair the current ones (cost $40 each, adding one more year of life).\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires have already been used for some time. For example, if a customer has tires that are three years old and can be repaired to last one more year, making their total lifespan four years. Or maybe the repair adds one year regardless of their current state.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer is considering replacing the tires now. So, the question is about whether to buy new tires (which last four years) or repair the existing ones (which would make them last one more year). But how long have the existing tires been in use already? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify. Wait, the problem says that the tires, when purchased new, last four years. So perhaps the current tires have been in use for three years, and the repair will make them last one more year, so four years in total.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the customer has current tires that are going to last one more year without repair. So, if they repair them, they get an extra year. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me re-read the problem.\n\nThe problem states: when purchased new, the tires last four years. The customer can purchase new tires at $180 each, or repair current tires at $40 each, which makes the current tires last for one additional year.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer is considering whether to buy new tires or repair their current ones. Let me model it.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires now. Cost: $180 per tire. They last four years. So, the customer will have these tires for four years.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires for $40 each. This repair makes the current tires last one additional year. So, how long will they last after the repair? If the current tires were going to last, say, x years without repair, the repair makes them last x+1 years.\n\nWait, but the problem states that when purchased new, they last four years. So perhaps the current tires are already new, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the customer is considering replacing new tires now, and the current tires have been in use for some time.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of the current tires as already being in use. Suppose the customer has tires that are, say, three years old. If they repair them, they get one more year, making the total lifespan four years. But without repair, would they last only three years? Or would they last four years in total, but the repair adds one more year beyond that?\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that the current tires, when new, last four years. So if the customer buys new tires, they last four years. If the customer chooses to repair, he pays $40 per tire and extends their current tires' life by one year. So, for example, if the customer's current tires are two years old, repairing them would make them last three more years, for a total of five years from the original purchase. But I think I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is that the repair adds one year to the current tires' life, regardless of how long they've been used. So, the current tires would last, say, x years without repair, and x+1 years with repair.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Let me try another approach. Let's think about the cost per year for each option.\n\nFor new tires: cost is $180, last 4 years. So average cost per year is 180 /4 = $45.\n\nFor repaired tires: the customer pays $40 to repair, and the tires last one additional year. So, how long do they last in total? Let me think: if the customer repairs, the tires last one more year than they would have otherwise. So, if the customer didn't repair, how long would they last? Well, the problem says that new tires last four years, so perhaps the current tires are new but have already been used for some time. Wait, no, perhaps the current tires are already being used, and the repair gives them one more year. So, without repair, they might have lasted, say, three years. Or maybe, perhaps the problem is that when the customer buys new tires, they last four years, and when they repair, they get one more year. So, for the same tire, the repair extends its life by one year beyond the original four.\n\nWait, no, that can't be. Because the problem states that when purchased new, they last four years. So, if the customer buys new tires, they last four years. But if the customer repairs his current tires, which are presumably not new, the repair adds one more year. So, perhaps the current tires have been used for, say, three years, and the repair will make them last one more year, for a total of four years of use.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is that the customer can either buy new tires (cost $180, last four years) or repair his current tires (cost $40, which makes them last one more year than they would have otherwise). So, for the current tires, without repair, they would last, perhaps, three years, and with repair, they last four years.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is more abstract. Let me model it mathematically.\n\nOption 1: New tires. Cost: $180. Life: 4 years. Average cost per year: 180 /4 = $45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires. Cost: $40. Life extension: 1 year. So, the current tires, without repair, would last for x years. With repair, they last x+1 years. But what is x?\n\nWait, the problem says that when purchased new, the tires last four years. So, perhaps the current tires were purchased new, and without repair, they would last four years. If the customer repairs them, they last one more year, so five years in total.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the customer's current tires are four years old, and he can repair them for $40 each to make them last one more year, so five years total.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the customer's current tires are already in use, and without repair, they would last, say, three years, but with repair, they last four years.\n\nHmm, this is getting confusing. Let me think again. The problem says: the customer can have his current tires repaired at $40 per tire, which will make them last for one additional year. So, if the customer chooses to repair, he extends their life by one year. So, the total lifespan becomes whatever it was before plus one.\n\nBut how long would the current tires last without repair? The problem says when purchased new, they last four years. So, if the customer's current tires are new, without repair, they last four years. But that doesn't make sense because if you buy new tires, you wouldn't repair them yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires have been in use for some time, and without repair, they have one year left. So, repairing them would make them last two years longer.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the customer is considering whether to repair his current tires (which are three years old) so that they last one more year, making a total of four years. Or perhaps the current tires have already been in use for three years and without repair would last one more year. So, repairing would make them last two more years.\n\nBut I think I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply that the current tires, when repaired, last one additional year. So, the cost per year for the repair option is $40 per tire for an extra year of life.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer is comparing the cost of buying new tires versus repairing his current ones. Let's model this as two scenarios.\n\nScenario 1: Buy new tires now. Cost per tire: $180. Lifespan: 4 years.\n\nScenario 2: Repair current tires. Cost per tire: $40. Lifespan: current lifespan plus one year. So, how long is the current lifespan?\n\nAh, perhaps the current tires are about to fail, so without repair, they would last zero years beyond now. But that doesn't make sense because the problem says that when purchased new, they last four years. So maybe the current tires have been in use for three years and would last one more year without repair. So, with repair, they last two more years.\n\nWait, that seems plausible. Let me think: if the current tires have been in use for three years, then without repair, they would last one more year, making a total of four years. So, with repair, they last one more year, making it five years total? Or perhaps, the repair adds one year beyond their current lifespan.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the customer's current tires are at the end of their useful life. If he doesn't repair, they would last one more year (total four years), and if he repairs, they would last two more years (total five years). So, the lifespan after repair is one additional year beyond their current state.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. Let's compute the average cost per year for each option, assuming that the customer's tires are at a certain point.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the customer's current tires have been in use for three years. Without repair, they would last one more year (total four years). If he repairs them, they last two more years (total five years). So, the cost for repair is $40 per tire, leading to a total lifespan of five years.\n\nSo, the average cost per year for the repair option would be $40 / 2 years (since the repair gives two more years?), but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no. Let's think: if the customer repairs the tires, he pays $40, and the tires last one additional year. So, the lifespan becomes one more year than they would have without repair.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires have been in use for three years, and without repair, they would last one more year, making four years. So, the customer is considering whether to repair them for $40, which would make them last five years in total. So, the lifespan is five years, and the cost is $40.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires, when repaired, last one additional year beyond their original lifespan. So, if the original lifespan is four years, the repaired tires would last five years. So, the cost is $40, and lifespan is five years.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to approach it differently.\n\nThe question is about average cost per year for each option. So, for the new tires: it's $180 for four years, so $45 per year.\n\nFor the repair option: $40 for an additional year. Wait, but how many years do the tires last with the repair? If the original tires would have lasted four years, and the repair adds one more, making five years. So, the cost is $40, lifespan five years. So average cost per year is 40 /5 = $8.\n\nWait, that's possible. So, new tires average $45 per year, repaired tires average $8 per year. Then, the question is asking by what percentage is the new tires' average cost greater than the repaired ones.\n\nWait, but that would be a huge percentage increase. Let me compute that.\n\nPercentage increase = (New - Repair) / Repair * 100.\n\nSo, (45 -8)/8 *100 = (37/8)*100 = 4.625 *100 = 462.5%. But that's not one of the options. The options are 8%, 10%, 12.5%, 16.7%, 25%.\n\nHmm, that suggests that I'm making a mistake in the calculation. So, perhaps I'm miscalculating the average cost for the repair option.\n\nWait, maybe I'm not considering the correct number of years for the repair option. Let's think again. The customer can repair his current tires for $40 per tire, and this makes the current tires last for one additional year.\n\nSo, perhaps the current tires, without repair, would have lasted, say, x years. With repair, they last x+1 years. But the problem doesn't specify x. However, the problem says that when purchased new, the tires last four years. So, perhaps the current tires are new, and the customer is deciding whether to keep them as new (buy new) or repair them. No, that doesn't make sense because if they're new, why repair them?\n\nWait, perhaps the customer has already used his current tires for a certain period, and the repair extends their lifespan. For example, if the current tires are two years old, and without repair, they would last two more years (total four), but with repair, they last three more years (total five). So, the cost of repair is $40 for an extra year.\n\nBut I'm not getting enough information. Let's try another approach. Let's assume that the repair adds one year to the current tires' lifespan, regardless of how long they've been in use.\n\nSo, if the customer buys new tires, they cost $180 and last four years. So average cost per year is 180/4 = $45.\n\nIf the customer repairs the current tires, paying $40, they get an additional year of use. So, the total lifespan becomes (original lifespan) +1. But what is the original lifespan?\n\nWait, perhaps the original lifespan is four years, as when purchased new. So, the customer's current tires, when purchased, had a four-year lifespan. Without repair, how much time do they have left? That's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the customer is considering whether to buy new tires now or repair his current ones, which are about to fail. So, without repair, they would last one more year, and with repair, they last two more years.\n\nSo, in that scenario: without repair, lifespan is 1 year; with repair, 2 years. So, the repair cost is $40, and lifespan is 2 years. So, average cost per year is 40 / 2 = $20.\n\nWait, but then the average cost per year for new tires is $45, and for repair it's $20. The percentage increase would be (45-20)/20 *100 = 25/20 *100 = 125%. But that's not an option either.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the repair allows the current tires to last for one additional year beyond their original lifespan. So, if the original lifespan is four years, the repair makes them last five years. So, the cost is $40, and lifespan is five years. So, average cost is 40 /5 = $8 per year.\n\nSo, new tires: $45 per year. Repaired: $8 per year. The question is, how much greater is the new tire's average cost than the repair option.\n\nSo, (45 -8)/8 *100 = (37/8)*100 = 4.625 *100 = 462.5% increase. But that's not an option.\n\nWait, but perhaps the current tires are already in use, and the repair adds one year to their current lifespan. So, perhaps the current tires have been in use for three years, and without repair, they would last one more year (total four). Repairing adds one year, making them last two more years beyond their current state (so total of five years). So, the cost is $40 for two additional years of use. So, average cost per year is 40 /2 = $20.\n\nThen, new tires are $45 per year. So, the increase is (45-20)/20 = 25/20 = 1.25, which is 125% increase. But the options don't have that.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the customer can repair the tires to last one additional year beyond the new tire's lifespan. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer's current tires are about to fail, so without repair, they would last zero more years. Repairing makes them last one year. So, the cost is $40 for one year of use. So, average cost per year is $40.\n\nThen, new tires are $45 per year. So, the percentage increase is (45-40)/40 *100 = (5/40)*100=12.5%. Oh, that's option C.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Let me check again.\n\nIf the current tires are about to fail (zero years left), and repairing them for $40 makes them last one year. So, average cost is 40 per year.\n\nNew tires: 180/4=45 per year.\n\nDifference: 45-40=5.\n\nPercentage increase: (5/40)*100 = 12.5%.\n\nSo, the correct answer would be C)12.5%.\n\nThat makes sense. So, the average cost per year for new tires is 12.5% greater than the repair option.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about tires and their costs over time. Hmm, let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question says that new tires of a certain brand last for four years. A customer can either buy new tires at $180 each or repair their current tires for $40 each, which extends their life by one additional year. The question is asking about the average cost per year for the new tires compared to the repaired ones, and specifically, by what percentage the new tires' average cost is greater.\n\nWait, I need to find the percentage increase from the repaired tires' cost to the new tires' cost on an annual basis.\n\nLet me break this down. First, I should calculate the average cost per year for both options.\n\nStarting with the new tires: each tire costs $180 and lasts four years. So the average cost per year would be the total cost divided by the number of years. That would be 180 divided by 4. Let me compute that: 180 /4 is 45. So each year, the new tire costs $45 on average.\n\nNow for the repaired tires: the customer can repair each tire for $40, which adds one more year to its life. Wait, but how long does the tire last before repair? The problem says when purchased new, they last four years. So if someone repairs them, I'm assuming they're using their current tires, which are already a few years old, but I think the problem might be simplifying it. Let me read again. Oh, the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So if the tires were going to last, say, three years without repair, then the repair adds one more, making it four years. Or wait, perhaps the initial lifetime is four years, and the repair extends that by one, making it five? Or maybe the customer is choosing between buying new (four years) or repairing current ones, which would last one more year beyond their current lifespan. Hmm, perhaps I should think of the initial state.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer is considering whether to replace or repair. Let's think of the current tires: if they repair them, they get one more year. So, how long do the current tires last without repair? Well, when you buy new, they last four years. So perhaps the customer has used them for a few years already, but I think the problem is more straightforward. Let me consider that the current tires have been used for a certain time, but when repaired, they last one more year. Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the customer can either buy new tires (cost $180 each, last four years) or repair the current ones (cost $40 each, adding one more year of life).\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires have already been used for some time. For example, if a customer has tires that are three years old and can be repaired to last one more year, making their total lifespan four years. Or maybe the repair adds one year regardless of their current state.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer is considering replacing the tires now. So, the question is about whether to buy new tires (which last four years) or repair the existing ones (which would make them last one more year). But how long have the existing tires been in use already? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify. Wait, the problem says that the tires, when purchased new, last four years. So perhaps the current tires have been in use for three years, and the repair will make them last one more year, so four years in total.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the customer has current tires that are going to last one more year without repair. So, if they repair them, they get an extra year. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me re-read the problem.\n\nThe problem states: when purchased new, the tires last four years. The customer can purchase new tires at $180 each, or repair current tires at $40 each, which makes the current tires last for one additional year.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer is considering whether to buy new tires or repair their current ones. Let me model it.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires now. Cost: $180 per tire. They last four years. So, the customer will have these tires for four years.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires for $40 each. This repair makes the current tires last one additional year. So, how long will they last after the repair? If the current tires were going to last, say, x years without repair, the repair makes them last x+1 years.\n\nWait, but the problem states that when purchased new, they last four years. So perhaps the current tires are already new, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the customer is considering replacing new tires now, and the current tires have been in use for some time.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of the current tires as already being in use. Suppose the customer has tires that are, say, three years old. If they repair them, they get one more year, making the total lifespan four years. But without repair, would they last only three years? Or would they last four years in total, but the repair adds one more year beyond that?\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that the current tires, when new, last four years. So if the customer buys new tires, they last four years. If the customer chooses to repair, he pays $40 per tire and extends their current tires' life by one year. So, for example, if the customer's current tires are two years old, repairing them would make them last three more years, for a total of five years from the original purchase. But I think I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is that the repair adds one year to the current tires' life, regardless of how long they've been used. So, the current tires would last, say, x years without repair, and x+1 years with repair.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Let me try another approach. Let's think about the cost per year for each option.\n\nFor new tires: cost is $180, last 4 years. So average cost per year is 180 /4 = $45.\n\nFor repaired tires: the customer pays $40 to repair, and the tires last one additional year. So, how long do they last in total? Let me think: if the customer repairs, the tires last one more year than they would have otherwise. So, if the customer didn't repair, how long would they last? Well, the problem says that new tires last four years, so perhaps the current tires are new but have already been used for some time. Wait, no, perhaps the current tires are already being used, and the repair gives them one more year. So, without repair, they might have lasted, say, three years. Or maybe, perhaps the problem is that when the customer buys new tires, they last four years, and when they repair, they get one more year. So, for the same tire, the repair extends its life by one year beyond the original four.\n\nWait, no, that can't be. Because the problem states that when purchased new, they last four years. So, if the customer buys new tires, they last four years. But if the customer repairs his current tires, which are presumably not new, the repair adds one more year. So, perhaps the current tires have been used for, say, three years, and the repair will make them last one more year, for a total of four years of use.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is that the customer can either buy new tires (cost $180, last four years) or repair his current tires (cost $40, which makes them last one more year than they would have otherwise). So, for the current tires, without repair, they would last, perhaps, three years, and with repair, they last four years.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is more abstract. Let me model it mathematically.\n\nOption 1: New tires. Cost: $180. Life: 4 years. Average cost per year: 180 /4 = $45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires. Cost: $40. Life extension: 1 year. So, the current tires, without repair, would last for x years. With repair, they last x+1 years. But what is x?\n\nWait, the problem says that when purchased new, the tires last four years. So, perhaps the current tires were purchased new, and without repair, they would last four years. If the customer repairs them, they last one more year, so five years in total.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the customer's current tires are four years old, and he can repair them for $40 each to make them last one more year, so five years total.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the customer's current tires are already in use, and without repair, they would last, say, three years, but with repair, they last four years.\n\nHmm, this is getting confusing. Let me think again. The problem says: the customer can have his current tires repaired at $40 per tire, which will make them last for one additional year. So, if the customer chooses to repair, he extends their life by one year. So, the total lifespan becomes whatever it was before plus one.\n\nBut how long would the current tires last without repair? The problem says when purchased new, they last four years. So, if the customer's current tires are new, without repair, they last four years. But that doesn't make sense because if you buy new tires, you wouldn't repair them yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires have been in use for some time, and without repair, they have one year left. So, repairing them would make them last two years longer.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the customer is considering whether to repair his current tires (which are three years old) so that they last one more year, making a total of four years. Or perhaps the current tires have already been in use for three years and without repair would last one more year. So, repairing would make them last two more years.\n\nBut I think I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply that the current tires, when repaired, last one additional year. So, the cost per year for the repair option is $40 per tire for an extra year of life.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer is comparing the cost of buying new tires versus repairing his current ones. Let's model this as two scenarios.\n\nScenario 1: Buy new tires now. Cost per tire: $180. Lifespan: 4 years.\n\nScenario 2: Repair current tires. Cost per tire: $40. Lifespan: current lifespan plus one year. So, how long is the current lifespan?\n\nAh, perhaps the current tires are about to fail, so without repair, they would last zero years beyond now. But that doesn't make sense because the problem says that when purchased new, they last four years. So maybe the current tires have been in use for three years and would last one more year without repair. So, with repair, they last two more years.\n\nWait, that seems plausible. Let me think: if the current tires have been in use for three years, then without repair, they would last one more year, making a total of four years. So, with repair, they last one more year, making it five years total? Or perhaps, the repair adds one year beyond their current lifespan.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the customer's current tires are at the end of their useful life. If he doesn't repair, they would last one more year (total four years), and if he repairs, they would last two more years (total five years). So, the lifespan after repair is one additional year beyond their current state.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. Let's compute the average cost per year for each option, assuming that the customer's tires are at a certain point.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the customer's current tires have been in use for three years. Without repair, they would last one more year (total four years). If he repairs them, they last two more years (total five years). So, the cost for repair is $40 per tire, leading to a total lifespan of five years.\n\nSo, the average cost per year for the repair option would be $40 / 2 years (since the repair gives two more years?), but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no. Let's think: if the customer repairs the tires, he pays $40, and the tires last one additional year. So, the lifespan becomes one more year than they would have without repair.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires have been in use for three years, and without repair, they would last one more year, making four years. So, the customer is considering whether to repair them for $40, which would make them last five years in total. So, the lifespan is five years, and the cost is $40.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires, when repaired, last one additional year beyond their original lifespan. So, if the original lifespan is four years, the repaired tires would last five years. So, the cost is $40, and lifespan is five years.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to approach it differently.\n\nThe question is about average cost per year for each option. So, for the new tires: it's $180 for four years, so $45 per year.\n\nFor the repair option: $40 for an additional year. Wait, but how many years do the tires last with the repair? If the original tires would have lasted four years, and the repair adds one more, making five years. So, the cost is $40, lifespan five years. So average cost per year is 40 /5 = $8.\n\nWait, that's possible. So, new tires average $45 per year, repaired tires average $8 per year. Then, the question is asking by what percentage is the new tires' average cost greater than the repaired ones.\n\nWait, but that would be a huge percentage increase. Let me compute that.\n\nPercentage increase = (New - Repair) / Repair * 100.\n\nSo, (45 -8)/8 *100 = (37/8)*100 = 4.625 *100 = 462.5%. But that's not one of the options. The options are 8%, 10%, 12.5%, 16.7%, 25%.\n\nHmm, that suggests that I'm making a mistake in the calculation. So, perhaps I'm miscalculating the average cost for the repair option.\n\nWait, maybe I'm not considering the correct number of years for the repair option. Let's think again. The customer can repair his current tires for $40 per tire, and this makes the current tires last for one additional year.\n\nSo, perhaps the current tires, without repair, would have lasted, say, x years. With repair, they last x+1 years. But the problem doesn't specify x. However, the problem says that when purchased new, the tires last four years. So, perhaps the current tires are new, and the customer is deciding whether to keep them as new (buy new) or repair them. No, that doesn't make sense because if they're new, why repair them?\n\nWait, perhaps the customer has already used his current tires for a certain period, and the repair extends their lifespan. For example, if the current tires are two years old, and without repair, they would last two more years (total four), but with repair, they last three more years (total five). So, the cost of repair is $40 for an extra year.\n\nBut I'm not getting enough information. Let's try another approach. Let's assume that the repair adds one year to the current tires' lifespan, regardless of how long they've been in use.\n\nSo, if the customer buys new tires, they cost $180 and last four years. So average cost per year is 180/4 = $45.\n\nIf the customer repairs the current tires, paying $40, they get an additional year of use. So, the total lifespan becomes (original lifespan) +1. But what is the original lifespan?\n\nWait, perhaps the original lifespan is four years, as when purchased new. So, the customer's current tires, when purchased, had a four-year lifespan. Without repair, how much time do they have left? That's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the customer is considering whether to buy new tires now or repair his current ones, which are about to fail. So, without repair, they would last one more year, and with repair, they last two more years.\n\nSo, in that scenario: without repair, lifespan is 1 year; with repair, 2 years. So, the repair cost is $40, and lifespan is 2 years. So, average cost per year is 40 / 2 = $20.\n\nWait, but then the average cost per year for new tires is $45, and for repair it's $20. The percentage increase would be (45-20)/20 *100 = 25/20 *100 = 125%. But that's not an option either.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the repair allows the current tires to last for one additional year beyond their original lifespan. So, if the original lifespan is four years, the repair makes them last five years. So, the cost is $40, and lifespan is five years. So, average cost is 40 /5 = $8 per year.\n\nSo, new tires: $45 per year. Repaired: $8 per year. The question is, how much greater is the new tire's average cost than the repair option.\n\nSo, (45 -8)/8 *100 = (37/8)*100 = 4.625 *100 = 462.5% increase. But that's not an option.\n\nWait, but perhaps the current tires are already in use, and the repair adds one year to their current lifespan. So, perhaps the current tires have been in use for three years, and without repair, they would last one more year (total four). Repairing adds one year, making them last two more years beyond their current state (so total of five years). So, the cost is $40 for two additional years of use. So, average cost per year is 40 /2 = $20.\n\nThen, new tires are $45 per year. So, the increase is (45-20)/20 = 25/20 = 1.25, which is 125% increase. But the options don't have that.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the customer can repair the tires to last one additional year beyond the new tire's lifespan. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer's current tires are about to fail, so without repair, they would last zero more years. Repairing makes them last one year. So, the cost is $40 for one year of use. So, average cost per year is $40.\n\nThen, new tires are $45 per year. So, the percentage increase is (45-40)/40 *100 = (5/40)*100=12.5%. Oh, that's option C.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Let me check again.\n\nIf the current tires are about to fail (zero years left), and repairing them for $40 makes them last one year. So, average cost is 40 per year.\n\nNew tires: 180/4=45 per year.\n\nDifference: 45-40=5.\n\nPercentage increase: (5/40)*100 = 12.5%.\n\nSo, the correct answer would be C)12.5%.\n\nThat makes sense. So, the average cost per year for new tires is 12.5% greater than the repair option.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage by which the average cost per year of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires, we calculate the average cost per year for both options.\n\n### New Tires:\n- **Cost per tire**: $180  \n- **Lifespan**: 4 years  \n- **Average cost per year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{180}{4} = 45 \\, \\text{\\$ per year}\n  \\]\n\n### Repaired Tires:\n- **Cost per tire**: $40  \n- **Additional lifespan**: 1 year  \n- **Assumption**: The current tires are about to fail (0 years left without repair), and repairing them makes them last for 1 additional year.  \n- **Average cost per year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{40}{1} = 40 \\, \\text{\\$ per year}\n  \\]\n\n### Percentage Increase:\nThe percentage by which the average cost of new tires is greater than the cost of repaired tires is calculated as:  \n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{New Cost} - \\text{Repair Cost}}{\\text{Repair Cost}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{45 - 40}{40} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{5}{40} \\right) \\times 100 = 12.5\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, the average cost per year of new tires is **12.5% greater** than the cost of repairing the current tires.\n\n**Answer: C**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about tires and costs. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I get all the details right.\n\nAlright, the question is about comparing the average cost per year for new tires versus repairing the current ones. Let's break it down.\n\nSo, new tires cost $180 each and last for four years. The customer's current tires can be repaired for $40 each, which adds one more year to their life. I guess the current tires are already on the car, so without repair, they might last for three years? Or maybe they were about to wear out, and the repair gives them an extra year? I'm a bit confused about that. Wait, the problem says when purchased new, they last for four years. So perhaps the current tires have already been used for some time and are about to need replacement. So the repair extends their life by a year.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of total life. Let me clarify: The new tires are purchased and last four years. The current tires can be repaired once for $40, making them last one more year than they would have otherwise. But I'm not sure how long the current tires have been used already. Oh wait, maybe the customer is deciding between buying new tires (which will last four years) or repairing the current ones (which will last one more year). Or is it that the current tires can be repaired once to add a year to their lifespan, but perhaps they were already on the car for some time?\n\nWait, the problem says, when purchased new, last for four years. So perhaps the current tires are already one, two, or three years old. But the problem doesn't specify how long the current tires have been in use. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe customer can choose to buy new tires at $180 each, which last four years. Or repair current tires at $40 each, which makes them last one additional year. So, the repair adds a year. So, the current tires without repair would last, say, X years. With repair, they last X+1 years. But the problem says, when purchased new, they last four years. So perhaps the current tires are new and have been used for some time. Wait, no, the customer is considering purchasing new or repairing current. So the current tires are not new anymore.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are already used, and the customer is considering whether to replace them or repair them. Let me think: if they buy new tires, they pay $180 and get four years of use. If they repair the current tires, they pay $40 and get one more year of use. But how many years have the current tires already lasted? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify. Oh wait, perhaps the current tires are about to wear out, so without repair, they would only last one more year, and with repair, they last two years. Or maybe the current tires are in their third year, so without repair, they'd last one more year (total four), and with repair, they last five? Hmm, I'm getting stuck.\n\nWait, maybe it's simpler. The problem is comparing the average cost per year of the new tires versus the average cost per year of repairing the current tires.\n\nSo, for the new tires: cost is $180, lifespan is four years. So average cost per year is 180/4 = $45 per year.\n\nFor the repair option: the cost is $40, and it adds one more year. Wait, but how long were the tires going to last before? Let me see. The problem says that when purchased new, they last four years. So perhaps the current tires are about to fail after, say, three years. So if you repair them, they last for four years. Or wait, maybe the current tires were purchased new and have been used for X years, and without repair, they have Y years left. But the problem doesn't specify how long the current tires have been in use. Hmm, maybe the current tires are about to fail, so without repair, they'd last one more year, making the total lifespan four years? Or maybe the current tires have been used for three years and without repair, they'll last one more (total four), and with repair, they'll last five? But the problem says the repair makes them last one additional year. So maybe the current tires without repair would last, say, three years, and with repair, four years. Or perhaps the repair adds one year to whatever their remaining lifespan is.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the current tires have been used for three years, and without repair, they would last one more year (total four). So the repair adds one more year beyond that, making them last five years. Hmm, but the problem says when purchased new, they last four years. So perhaps the current tires are new, but that's confusing. Wait, no, the customer is considering purchasing new tires or repairing current tires. So the current tires are not new anymore.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is this: The new tires cost $180 and last four years. The current tires can be repaired for $40, which adds one year to their lifespan. So the current tires without repair would have a lifespan of, say, three years, and with repair, four years. So the total lifespan after repair is four years. So the average cost per year for the repair option would be 40 divided by four years, which is $10 per year.\n\nWait, but wait, the initial lifespan without repair is unclear. Let's think again. The problem says that when purchased new, the tires last four years. So, the customer's current tires were purchased new, but they're now at some point in their lifespan. So the customer is considering whether to buy new tires (cost $180, four years) or repair the current ones (cost $40, adding one year). So, let's model the two options:\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Cost is $180, lifespan is four years. So average cost per year is 180 /4 = $45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires. Cost is $40, which adds one year. So how long will the tires last after repair? The problem says that when purchased new, they last four years. So perhaps the current tires are about to last one more year without repair, so with repair, they last two more years? Or maybe the repair adds one year beyond what they would have had. Hmm, the wording is tricky.\n\nWait, the problem says that when purchased new, the tires last four years. So, the customer's current tires were purchased new and have been used for a certain time. Let's say the current tires have been used for 'n' years. Without repair, they would last for (4 - n) years. But the problem doesn't specify 'n'. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the repair adds one year to their lifespan, regardless of how much time they've already been used. So if the customer repairs them, they get one more year beyond whatever they would have had. But without knowing how much they've been used, this approach may not work.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simpler. Maybe the current tires are already in their last year, so without repair, they'll only last one more year. If you repair them, they'll last two more years. So the total lifespan after repair is two years. But the problem says the repair adds one additional year. So the original lifespan without repair is one year, and with repair, two years. So the cost per year would be 40 /2 = $20 per year. But then the new tires are 180 /4=45, which is higher, but the question is, how much greater is the new tire cost compared to repair.\n\nWait, that would make the repair option cheaper per year, but the question is about the average cost per year of new tires compared to the repair.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are about to last three years without repair, and with repair, they last four years. So the repair adds one year beyond three, making four. So the cost per year for repair would be 40 /4= $10 per year.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So perhaps without repair, the current tires would last, say, three years, and with repair, four years. So the cost per year for repair is 40/4 =10.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify how long the current tires would last without repair. Hmm. Wait, the problem says when purchased new, the tires last four years. So perhaps the current tires have been used for three years, and without repair, they would last one more year (total four). If you repair them, they last one more year, making five years. So the cost per year would be 40 /5 =8.\n\nWait, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe the current tires are about to fail, so without repair, they would last one more year. With repair, they last two years. So the average cost per year for repair is 40/2=20.\n\nBut then the new tire's average cost is 45, which is 2.25 times the repair cost, which is 20. But that doesn't match any of the options given.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Let's assume that the customer is choosing between two options:\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires now. Cost: $180. Lifespan: 4 years. So annual cost is 180/4 = $45 per year.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires. Cost: $40. This repair adds one year to their lifespan. So how long do they last now? Let's say the current tires, without repair, would last 'x' years. After repair, they last x+1 years. But without knowing 'x', how can we compute the cost per year?\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are already in their third year, so without repair, they would last one more year (total four). So x=1. With repair, they last two more years, making x+1=2. So the total lifespan after repair is 3 + 2 =5? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the current tires are in their third year of use, so without repair, they would last one more year (total four). So, if the customer chooses to repair, the tires last one more year than that, making five years. But this is getting too speculative.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering that the current tires are about to last one more year without repair, and the repair adds another year. So the lifespan becomes two years. So the repair cost is $40 for two years. So annual cost is 40/2= $20 per year.\n\nSo, comparing new tires at 45 per year versus repair at 20 per year.\n\nThe question is asking: The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\n\nSo, we need to find (45 - 20)/20 *100% = (25/20)*100% = 125%. Wait, that's 125% greater, but that's not one of the options. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires without repair would last four years, but that doesn't make sense because the problem says the new tires last four years. Wait, no, the customer is considering repair, so the current tires are not new.\n\nWait, maybe the current tires are already in their third year, so without repair, they have one year left (total four). So with repair, they last two more years, making five years. So the repair cost is $40, and they last two years. So annual cost is 40/2 = $20.\n\nThen, new tires are 180/4 =45.\n\nSo, the question is, what's the percentage increase from the repair cost (20) to the new tire cost (45).\n\nSo, the increase is 45-20=25.\n\nSo, 25 is what percent of 20? (25/20)*100 =125%. So 125% greater. But that's not an option either.\n\nWait, the options are 8%,10%,12.5%,16.7%,25%.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair extends the lifespan by one year, not adding to the remaining lifespan. So, the current tires are already three years old, and without repair, they would last one more year (total four). With repair, they last one additional year beyond that, making five years. So the repair cost is $40, and they last two years (since they're already three years old, and the repair gives them two more years? No, wait, that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires have been used for three years, so they have one year left without repair. Repairing adds one more year, making them last two years after repair. So the total lifespan after repair is four years. So the cost is $40, and they last two years. So the average cost per year is 40/2=20.\n\nNew tires: 180/4=45.\n\nSo the increase is 45-20=25. So percentage increase is (25/20)*100=125%. Again, that's not an option. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me see the options again. Oh, option C is 12.5%, which is 1/8. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the repair adds one year, so the lifespan is four years. So the cost is $40 for four years. So average cost per year is 40/4=10.\n\nNew tires: 180/4=45.\n\nSo the difference is 45-10=35. So percentage increase is (35/10)*100=350%. But that's not an option either.\n\nWait, maybe the current tires without repair would last three years, and with repair, four. So the cost per year is 40/4=10.\n\nNew tires:45.\n\nDifference:45-10=35. 35/10=3.5, which is 350% increase. Not matching the options.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think of the two options' average costs.\n\nOption1: new tires: $180 for 4 years \u2192 $45/year.\n\nOption2: repair: $40 for 1 additional year \u2192 so lifespan becomes 4 years? Because when new, they last four years. So if you repair, they last four years as well.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are about to last three years without repair. Repairing makes them last four years.\n\nSo the cost per year for repair is 40 /4 =10.\n\nThen, the new tires are 45 per year. So the question is, 45 is what percent higher than 10.\n\n(45-10)/10 =3.5 \u2192 350% increase. But that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the repair's effect. Maybe the repair adds one more year beyond whatever their current lifespan is. So, for example, if the current tires have been used for x years, the repair makes them last x+1 years. But without knowing x, this is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires are about to fail, so without repair, they last one more year. With repair, they last two years. So the cost per year is 40/2=20.\n\nSo new tires are 45 per year.\n\n45 is how much greater than 20?\n\n(45-20)/20 =25/20=1.25 \u2192 125% increase. Not an option.\n\nWait, but the options have 12.5%, which is 1/8. Maybe I'm miscalculating the average cost.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires, when repaired, last one additional year. So if the customer repairs, the tires will last for four years in total. So the repair cost is $40 for four years. So average per year is 40/4=10.\n\nNew tires: 180/4=45.\n\nSo 45 is 45/10 =4.5 times higher, which is 350% increase. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is done once, and the tires last one more year than their original lifespan. So, if the original lifespan is four years, with repair, they last five. So cost is $40 for five years. 40/5=8 per year.\n\nNew tires:45 per year.\n\nDifference is 45-8=37. 37/8=4.625, 462.5% increase. No.\n\nWait, maybe the repair allows the current tires to last one more year beyond their original lifespan. So the original lifespan is four years. With repair, five years. So cost is 40/5=8 per year.\n\nSo the new tires are 45 per year. The difference is 45-8=37. 37/8=4.625, which is 462.5% higher. Not an option.\n\nI must be missing something here. Let me try another approach.\n\nPerhaps the problem is considering that the current tires have been in use for three years and without repair, they will only last one more year (total four). Repairing them makes them last two more years (total five). So the repair cost is $40, and the lifespan is two years. So average cost per year is 40/2=20.\n\nNew tires:45 per year.\n\nSo the increase is (45-20)/20=25/20=1.25=125% increase. But that's not an option. So perhaps the correct way is different.\n\nWait, maybe the repair adds one year to the current tires' lifespan, regardless of how much they've been used. So the current tires have a certain remaining lifespan, say, 'r' years, and after repair, it's 'r+1' years. But without knowing 'r', perhaps the problem assumes that the repair makes the tires last four years in total. So perhaps the current tires, without repair, would last three years, and with repair, four years. So the average cost per year for repair is 40/4=10.\n\nThen, new tires are 45 per year. So the increase is 45-10=35. 35/10=3.5=350% increase. Not matching options.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: when purchased new, last for four years. A customer can purchase new tires for $180 each, or have current tires repaired for $40 each, which makes them last for one additional year.\n\nSo, the repair adds one year to their lifespan. So, the customer's current tires have been used for some time, and the repair adds one more year to their lifespan. But how much longer will they last without the repair? The problem doesn't specify, but perhaps it's irrelevant because the cost per year for the repair is 40 divided by the number of years they will last after repair.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer's current tires have been used for three years. So without repair, they would last one more year (total four). With repair, they last two more years (total five). So the repair cost is $40, and the lifespan is two years. So average cost per year is 40/2=20.\n\nNew tires: 180/4=45.\n\nSo, the new tires cost 45 per year, repair is 20 per year.\n\nSo, the percentage increase is (45-20)/20 =25/20=1.25 \u2192 125% increase. But the options don't have 125%. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires, when repaired, last four years in total. So the repair adds one year to their lifespan, making it four years. So the cost per year is 40/4=10.\n\nNew tires:45.\n\nSo, 45 is how much more than 10? 35. 35 is 3.5 times 10, which is 350% increase. Still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the cost per year as the cost per year of the tire's life, not considering how many years they have left. So, for the new tires, it's 4 years for $180. For the repair, it's one year for $40. So the average cost per year is 180/4=45 for new, and 40/1=40 for repair.\n\nWait, that would make the repair option 40 per year, and new tires 45. So the new tires are 5 more per year. 5/40=0.125=12.5% increase. So that would match option C)12.5%.\n\nBut wait, that seems to ignore the fact that the repair adds an additional year. So, the repair makes the current tires last one more year. So if the customer repairs, they get one more year of use from the current tires. So, the repair cost is $40, and the lifespan is increased by one year.\n\nBut then, how many years would the tires last after repair? For example, if the current tires had two years of life left, repair would make them last three. But without knowing their current age, it's hard to compute the average cost per year.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is considering that the repair allows the tires to last for four years, regardless of their current state. So, the customer is deciding between buying new tires (four years, $180) or repairing the current ones (four years, $40). But that can't be right because the repair adds one year, not making them last four years.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way I'm calculating the average cost.\n\nAnother approach: For each option, find the average cost per year, then compute the percentage increase.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires.\n\nCost: $180.\n\nLifespan:4 years.\n\nAverage cost per year: 180 /4 =45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires.\n\nCost: $40.\n\nLifespan: the repair adds one year. So if the current tires were going to last 'x' years without repair, they'll last 'x+1' years with repair.\n\nBut without knowing 'x', I can't compute the average cost. So perhaps the problem assumes that the current tires are about to last one year without repair, so with repair, they last two years. So average cost per year is 40 /2=20.\n\nThen, new tires are 45, which is 25 more than 20. 25/20=1.25=125% increase. But that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, if the current tires without repair would last three years, so with repair, four. So average cost is 40/4=10. New tires are 45, which is 35 more. 35/10=3.5=350% increase. Again, not matching options.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering that the repair cost is $40, and it gives the tires one more year beyond their original lifespan of four years. So the lifespan becomes five years. So average cost per year is 40/5=8.\n\nNew tires are 45 per year. So the increase is (45-8)/8 =37/8=4.625=462.5% increase. Not an option.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Let me think of another approach.\n\nWait, maybe the question is comparing the cost per year for the new tires versus the cost per year for the repair. So for the repair, the cost is $40 for one additional year. So the average cost per year for the repair is 40 per year for that one year. So 40/1=40.\n\nNew tires are 45 per year. So the new tires are 5 more per year. 5/40=0.125=12.5% increase. That would be option C.\n\nWait, but that doesn't account for the fact that the repair extends the tire's life by a year. So, for example, if the current tires have two years left, the repair makes them last three, so the average cost per year would be 40/3\u224813.33. But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe it's considering the repair as adding one year, and the cost per year is 40 for that one year. So 40/1=40.\n\nSo, in that case, new tires are 45, repair is 40. So 45 is 5 more than 40, which is 12.5% increase.\n\nSo the answer would be 12.5%, which is option C.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the percentage by which the average cost per year of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires, we analyze the two options:\n\n### Option 1: New Tires\n- **Cost**: $180 per tire  \n- **Lifespan**: 4 years  \n- **Average Cost per Year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{180}{4} = 45 \\, \\text{\\$/year}\n  \\]\n\n### Option 2: Repair Current Tires\n- **Cost**: $40 per tire  \n- **Additional Lifespan**: 1 year  \n- **Assumption**: The repair extends the lifespan of the current tires by 1 year.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about tires and costs. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I get all the details right.\n\nAlright, the question is about comparing the average cost per year for new tires versus repairing the current ones. Let's break it down.\n\nSo, new tires cost $180 each and last for four years. The customer's current tires can be repaired for $40 each, which adds one more year to their life. I guess the current tires are already on the car, so without repair, they might last for three years? Or maybe they were about to wear out, and the repair gives them an extra year? I'm a bit confused about that. Wait, the problem says when purchased new, they last for four years. So perhaps the current tires have already been used for some time and are about to need replacement. So the repair extends their life by a year.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of total life. Let me clarify: The new tires are purchased and last four years. The current tires can be repaired once for $40, making them last one more year than they would have otherwise. But I'm not sure how long the current tires have been used already. Oh wait, maybe the customer is deciding between buying new tires (which will last four years) or repairing the current ones (which will last one more year). Or is it that the current tires can be repaired once to add a year to their lifespan, but perhaps they were already on the car for some time?\n\nWait, the problem says, when purchased new, last for four years. So perhaps the current tires are already one, two, or three years old. But the problem doesn't specify how long the current tires have been in use. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe customer can choose to buy new tires at $180 each, which last four years. Or repair current tires at $40 each, which makes them last one additional year. So, the repair adds a year. So, the current tires without repair would last, say, X years. With repair, they last X+1 years. But the problem says, when purchased new, they last four years. So perhaps the current tires are new and have been used for some time. Wait, no, the customer is considering purchasing new or repairing current. So the current tires are not new anymore.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are already used, and the customer is considering whether to replace them or repair them. Let me think: if they buy new tires, they pay $180 and get four years of use. If they repair the current tires, they pay $40 and get one more year of use. But how many years have the current tires already lasted? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify. Oh wait, perhaps the current tires are about to wear out, so without repair, they would only last one more year, and with repair, they last two years. Or maybe the current tires are in their third year, so without repair, they'd last one more year (total four), and with repair, they last five? Hmm, I'm getting stuck.\n\nWait, maybe it's simpler. The problem is comparing the average cost per year of the new tires versus the average cost per year of repairing the current tires.\n\nSo, for the new tires: cost is $180, lifespan is four years. So average cost per year is 180/4 = $45 per year.\n\nFor the repair option: the cost is $40, and it adds one more year. Wait, but how long were the tires going to last before? Let me see. The problem says that when purchased new, they last four years. So perhaps the current tires are about to fail after, say, three years. So if you repair them, they last for four years. Or wait, maybe the current tires were purchased new and have been used for X years, and without repair, they have Y years left. But the problem doesn't specify how long the current tires have been in use. Hmm, maybe the current tires are about to fail, so without repair, they'd last one more year, making the total lifespan four years? Or maybe the current tires have been used for three years and without repair, they'll last one more (total four), and with repair, they'll last five? But the problem says the repair makes them last one additional year. So maybe the current tires without repair would last, say, three years, and with repair, four years. Or perhaps the repair adds one year to whatever their remaining lifespan is.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the current tires have been used for three years, and without repair, they would last one more year (total four). So the repair adds one more year beyond that, making them last five years. Hmm, but the problem says when purchased new, they last four years. So perhaps the current tires are new, but that's confusing. Wait, no, the customer is considering purchasing new tires or repairing current tires. So the current tires are not new anymore.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is this: The new tires cost $180 and last four years. The current tires can be repaired for $40, which adds one year to their lifespan. So the current tires without repair would have a lifespan of, say, three years, and with repair, four years. So the total lifespan after repair is four years. So the average cost per year for the repair option would be 40 divided by four years, which is $10 per year.\n\nWait, but wait, the initial lifespan without repair is unclear. Let's think again. The problem says that when purchased new, the tires last four years. So, the customer's current tires were purchased new, but they're now at some point in their lifespan. So the customer is considering whether to buy new tires (cost $180, four years) or repair the current ones (cost $40, adding one year). So, let's model the two options:\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Cost is $180, lifespan is four years. So average cost per year is 180 /4 = $45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires. Cost is $40, which adds one year. So how long will the tires last after repair? The problem says that when purchased new, they last four years. So perhaps the current tires are about to last one more year without repair, so with repair, they last two more years? Or maybe the repair adds one year beyond what they would have had. Hmm, the wording is tricky.\n\nWait, the problem says that when purchased new, the tires last four years. So, the customer's current tires were purchased new and have been used for a certain time. Let's say the current tires have been used for 'n' years. Without repair, they would last for (4 - n) years. But the problem doesn't specify 'n'. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the repair adds one year to their lifespan, regardless of how much time they've already been used. So if the customer repairs them, they get one more year beyond whatever they would have had. But without knowing how much they've been used, this approach may not work.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simpler. Maybe the current tires are already in their last year, so without repair, they'll only last one more year. If you repair them, they'll last two more years. So the total lifespan after repair is two years. But the problem says the repair adds one additional year. So the original lifespan without repair is one year, and with repair, two years. So the cost per year would be 40 /2 = $20 per year. But then the new tires are 180 /4=45, which is higher, but the question is, how much greater is the new tire cost compared to repair.\n\nWait, that would make the repair option cheaper per year, but the question is about the average cost per year of new tires compared to the repair.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are about to last three years without repair, and with repair, they last four years. So the repair adds one year beyond three, making four. So the cost per year for repair would be 40 /4= $10 per year.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So perhaps without repair, the current tires would last, say, three years, and with repair, four years. So the cost per year for repair is 40/4 =10.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify how long the current tires would last without repair. Hmm. Wait, the problem says when purchased new, the tires last four years. So perhaps the current tires have been used for three years, and without repair, they would last one more year (total four). If you repair them, they last one more year, making five years. So the cost per year would be 40 /5 =8.\n\nWait, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe the current tires are about to fail, so without repair, they would last one more year. With repair, they last two years. So the average cost per year for repair is 40/2=20.\n\nBut then the new tire's average cost is 45, which is 2.25 times the repair cost, which is 20. But that doesn't match any of the options given.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Let's assume that the customer is choosing between two options:\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires now. Cost: $180. Lifespan: 4 years. So annual cost is 180/4 = $45 per year.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires. Cost: $40. This repair adds one year to their lifespan. So how long do they last now? Let's say the current tires, without repair, would last 'x' years. After repair, they last x+1 years. But without knowing 'x', how can we compute the cost per year?\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are already in their third year, so without repair, they would last one more year (total four). So x=1. With repair, they last two more years, making x+1=2. So the total lifespan after repair is 3 + 2 =5? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the current tires are in their third year of use, so without repair, they would last one more year (total four). So, if the customer chooses to repair, the tires last one more year than that, making five years. But this is getting too speculative.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering that the current tires are about to last one more year without repair, and the repair adds another year. So the lifespan becomes two years. So the repair cost is $40 for two years. So annual cost is 40/2= $20 per year.\n\nSo, comparing new tires at 45 per year versus repair at 20 per year.\n\nThe question is asking: The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\n\nSo, we need to find (45 - 20)/20 *100% = (25/20)*100% = 125%. Wait, that's 125% greater, but that's not one of the options. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires without repair would last four years, but that doesn't make sense because the problem says the new tires last four years. Wait, no, the customer is considering repair, so the current tires are not new.\n\nWait, maybe the current tires are already in their third year, so without repair, they have one year left (total four). So with repair, they last two more years, making five years. So the repair cost is $40, and they last two years. So annual cost is 40/2 = $20.\n\nThen, new tires are 180/4 =45.\n\nSo, the question is, what's the percentage increase from the repair cost (20) to the new tire cost (45).\n\nSo, the increase is 45-20=25.\n\nSo, 25 is what percent of 20? (25/20)*100 =125%. So 125% greater. But that's not an option either.\n\nWait, the options are 8%,10%,12.5%,16.7%,25%.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair extends the lifespan by one year, not adding to the remaining lifespan. So, the current tires are already three years old, and without repair, they would last one more year (total four). With repair, they last one additional year beyond that, making five years. So the repair cost is $40, and they last two years (since they're already three years old, and the repair gives them two more years? No, wait, that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires have been used for three years, so they have one year left without repair. Repairing adds one more year, making them last two years after repair. So the total lifespan after repair is four years. So the cost is $40, and they last two years. So the average cost per year is 40/2=20.\n\nNew tires: 180/4=45.\n\nSo the increase is 45-20=25. So percentage increase is (25/20)*100=125%. Again, that's not an option. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me see the options again. Oh, option C is 12.5%, which is 1/8. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the repair adds one year, so the lifespan is four years. So the cost is $40 for four years. So average cost per year is 40/4=10.\n\nNew tires: 180/4=45.\n\nSo the difference is 45-10=35. So percentage increase is (35/10)*100=350%. But that's not an option either.\n\nWait, maybe the current tires without repair would last three years, and with repair, four. So the cost per year is 40/4=10.\n\nNew tires:45.\n\nDifference:45-10=35. 35/10=3.5, which is 350% increase. Not matching the options.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think of the two options' average costs.\n\nOption1: new tires: $180 for 4 years \u2192 $45/year.\n\nOption2: repair: $40 for 1 additional year \u2192 so lifespan becomes 4 years? Because when new, they last four years. So if you repair, they last four years as well.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are about to last three years without repair. Repairing makes them last four years.\n\nSo the cost per year for repair is 40 /4 =10.\n\nThen, the new tires are 45 per year. So the question is, 45 is what percent higher than 10.\n\n(45-10)/10 =3.5 \u2192 350% increase. But that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the repair's effect. Maybe the repair adds one more year beyond whatever their current lifespan is. So, for example, if the current tires have been used for x years, the repair makes them last x+1 years. But without knowing x, this is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires are about to fail, so without repair, they last one more year. With repair, they last two years. So the cost per year is 40/2=20.\n\nSo new tires are 45 per year.\n\n45 is how much greater than 20?\n\n(45-20)/20 =25/20=1.25 \u2192 125% increase. Not an option.\n\nWait, but the options have 12.5%, which is 1/8. Maybe I'm miscalculating the average cost.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires, when repaired, last one additional year. So if the customer repairs, the tires will last for four years in total. So the repair cost is $40 for four years. So average per year is 40/4=10.\n\nNew tires: 180/4=45.\n\nSo 45 is 45/10 =4.5 times higher, which is 350% increase. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is done once, and the tires last one more year than their original lifespan. So, if the original lifespan is four years, with repair, they last five. So cost is $40 for five years. 40/5=8 per year.\n\nNew tires:45 per year.\n\nDifference is 45-8=37. 37/8=4.625, 462.5% increase. No.\n\nWait, maybe the repair allows the current tires to last one more year beyond their original lifespan. So the original lifespan is four years. With repair, five years. So cost is 40/5=8 per year.\n\nSo the new tires are 45 per year. The difference is 45-8=37. 37/8=4.625, which is 462.5% higher. Not an option.\n\nI must be missing something here. Let me try another approach.\n\nPerhaps the problem is considering that the current tires have been in use for three years and without repair, they will only last one more year (total four). Repairing them makes them last two more years (total five). So the repair cost is $40, and the lifespan is two years. So average cost per year is 40/2=20.\n\nNew tires:45 per year.\n\nSo the increase is (45-20)/20=25/20=1.25=125% increase. But that's not an option. So perhaps the correct way is different.\n\nWait, maybe the repair adds one year to the current tires' lifespan, regardless of how much they've been used. So the current tires have a certain remaining lifespan, say, 'r' years, and after repair, it's 'r+1' years. But without knowing 'r', perhaps the problem assumes that the repair makes the tires last four years in total. So perhaps the current tires, without repair, would last three years, and with repair, four years. So the average cost per year for repair is 40/4=10.\n\nThen, new tires are 45 per year. So the increase is 45-10=35. 35/10=3.5=350% increase. Not matching options.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: when purchased new, last for four years. A customer can purchase new tires for $180 each, or have current tires repaired for $40 each, which makes them last for one additional year.\n\nSo, the repair adds one year to their lifespan. So, the customer's current tires have been used for some time, and the repair adds one more year to their lifespan. But how much longer will they last without the repair? The problem doesn't specify, but perhaps it's irrelevant because the cost per year for the repair is 40 divided by the number of years they will last after repair.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer's current tires have been used for three years. So without repair, they would last one more year (total four). With repair, they last two more years (total five). So the repair cost is $40, and the lifespan is two years. So average cost per year is 40/2=20.\n\nNew tires: 180/4=45.\n\nSo, the new tires cost 45 per year, repair is 20 per year.\n\nSo, the percentage increase is (45-20)/20 =25/20=1.25 \u2192 125% increase. But the options don't have 125%. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires, when repaired, last four years in total. So the repair adds one year to their lifespan, making it four years. So the cost per year is 40/4=10.\n\nNew tires:45.\n\nSo, 45 is how much more than 10? 35. 35 is 3.5 times 10, which is 350% increase. Still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the cost per year as the cost per year of the tire's life, not considering how many years they have left. So, for the new tires, it's 4 years for $180. For the repair, it's one year for $40. So the average cost per year is 180/4=45 for new, and 40/1=40 for repair.\n\nWait, that would make the repair option 40 per year, and new tires 45. So the new tires are 5 more per year. 5/40=0.125=12.5% increase. So that would match option C)12.5%.\n\nBut wait, that seems to ignore the fact that the repair adds an additional year. So, the repair makes the current tires last one more year. So if the customer repairs, they get one more year of use from the current tires. So, the repair cost is $40, and the lifespan is increased by one year.\n\nBut then, how many years would the tires last after repair? For example, if the current tires had two years of life left, repair would make them last three. But without knowing their current age, it's hard to compute the average cost per year.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is considering that the repair allows the tires to last for four years, regardless of their current state. So, the customer is deciding between buying new tires (four years, $180) or repairing the current ones (four years, $40). But that can't be right because the repair adds one year, not making them last four years.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way I'm calculating the average cost.\n\nAnother approach: For each option, find the average cost per year, then compute the percentage increase.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires.\n\nCost: $180.\n\nLifespan:4 years.\n\nAverage cost per year: 180 /4 =45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires.\n\nCost: $40.\n\nLifespan: the repair adds one year. So if the current tires were going to last 'x' years without repair, they'll last 'x+1' years with repair.\n\nBut without knowing 'x', I can't compute the average cost. So perhaps the problem assumes that the current tires are about to last one year without repair, so with repair, they last two years. So average cost per year is 40 /2=20.\n\nThen, new tires are 45, which is 25 more than 20. 25/20=1.25=125% increase. But that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, if the current tires without repair would last three years, so with repair, four. So average cost is 40/4=10. New tires are 45, which is 35 more. 35/10=3.5=350% increase. Again, not matching options.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering that the repair cost is $40, and it gives the tires one more year beyond their original lifespan of four years. So the lifespan becomes five years. So average cost per year is 40/5=8.\n\nNew tires are 45 per year. So the increase is (45-8)/8 =37/8=4.625=462.5% increase. Not an option.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Let me think of another approach.\n\nWait, maybe the question is comparing the cost per year for the new tires versus the cost per year for the repair. So for the repair, the cost is $40 for one additional year. So the average cost per year for the repair is 40 per year for that one year. So 40/1=40.\n\nNew tires are 45 per year. So the new tires are 5 more per year. 5/40=0.125=12.5% increase. That would be option C.\n\nWait, but that doesn't account for the fact that the repair extends the tire's life by a year. So, for example, if the current tires have two years left, the repair makes them last three, so the average cost per year would be 40/3\u224813.33. But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe it's considering the repair as adding one year, and the cost per year is 40 for that one year. So 40/1=40.\n\nSo, in that case, new tires are 45, repair is 40. So 45 is 5 more than 40, which is 12.5% increase.\n\nSo the answer would be 12.5%, which is option C.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage by which the average cost per year of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires, we analyze the two options:\n\n### Option 1: New Tires\n- **Cost**: $180 per tire  \n- **Lifespan**: 4 years  \n- **Average Cost per Year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{180}{4} = 45 \\, \\text{\\$/year}\n  \\]\n\n### Option 2: Repair Current Tires\n- **Cost**: $40 per tire  \n- **Additional Lifespan**: 1 year  \n- **Assumption**: The repair extends the lifespan of the current tires by 1 year. Since the problem does not specify the remaining lifespan of the current tires, we assume the repair provides 1 additional year of use.  \n- **Average Cost per Year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{40}{1} = 40 \\, \\text{\\$/year}\n  \\]\n\n### Percentage Increase\nTo find the percentage by which the average cost per year of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires, we use the formula:  \n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Difference in Costs}}{\\text{Cost of Repair}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n- **Difference in Costs**:  \n  \\[\n  45 - 40 = 5 \\, \\text{\\$}\n  \\]\n- **Percentage Increase**:  \n  \\[\n  \\left( \\frac{5}{40} \\right) \\times 100 = 12.5\\%\n  \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe average cost per year of new tires is **12.5% greater** than the cost of repairing the current tires.\n\n**Answer: C**",
