      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where a rectangular solid with dimensions 3 x 4 x 15 is inscribed in a sphere. All eight of its vertices are on the sphere, and I need to find the diameter of the sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on geometry, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nWait, when a solid is inscribed in a sphere like that, the sphere's diameter should be the same as the solid's space diagonal, right? Because the space diagonal would stretch from one corner of the solid to the opposite corner, passing through the center of the sphere. So the diameter of the sphere is equal to the length of this space diagonal.\n\nOh right, the formula for the space diagonal (d) of a rectangular solid with length l, width w, and height h is d = sqrt(l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2). Yeah, I remember that from earlier. So I just need to plug in the given dimensions into this formula.\n\nLet me calculate each part step by step. The dimensions are 3, 4, and 15. So l=3, w=4, h=15.\n\nFirst, I'll square each dimension. So 3 squared is 9, 4 squared is 16, and 15 squared is 225. Then I add them all together: 9 + 16 is 25, plus 225 gives me 250. So the sum inside the square root is 250.\n\nNow I take the square root of 250. Let me see, sqrt(250) is the same as sqrt(25 * 10), which is 5*sqrt(10). Wait, what's sqrt(10) approximately? Oh right, sqrt(10) is about 3.1623. So 5 * 3.1623 equals approximately 15.8115.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the diameter, which is the space diagonal. So the diameter is 15.8115. Looking at the options, option B is 15.8113. That must be the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recalculate the squares: 3\u00b2 is 9, 4\u00b2 is 16, 15\u00b2 is 225. Adding them: 9 +16 =25, plus 225 is 250. Square root of 250 is indeed sqrt(250) = approx 15.8113.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a rectangular solid inscribed in a sphere. Hmm, I remember that when a solid is inscribed in a sphere, all its vertices lie on the sphere's surface. So the sphere's diameter should be related to the solid's dimensions. \n\nThe solid is 3 x 4 x 15. Wait, I think the key here is to find the space diagonal of the rectangular solid because that diagonal would be the diameter of the sphere. Oh right, the sphere's diameter is the same as the solid's space diagonal. \n\nHow do I find the space diagonal of a rectangular solid? Oh right, it's using the formula derived from the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions. The formula is d = sqrt(l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2), where l, w, h are the length, width, and height.\n\nSo plugging in the values, l is 3, w is 4, h is 15. Let me calculate each squared: \n\n3 squared is 9, 4 squared is 16, and 15 squared is 225. Adding those together: 9 + 16 is 25, plus 225 gives 250. So the square of the diagonal is 250. Taking the square root of 250... Hmm, what's sqrt(250)?\n\nWait, 250 is 25 times 10, so sqrt(25*10) is 5*sqrt(10). Because sqrt(25) is 5 and sqrt(10) is about 3.1623. So 5 * 3.1623 is 15.8115. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is 15.8113, which is very close. So the diameter should be approximately 15.8113. \n\nWait a second, but wait.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a rectangular solid inscribed in a sphere. Hmm, I remember that when a solid is inscribed in a sphere, all its vertices lie on the sphere's surface. The sphere's diameter should be the same as the solid's space diagonal. Right, because the space diagonal stretches from one vertex to the opposite, passing through the center of the sphere, so that would be the diameter.\n\nWait, the solid is 3 x 4 x 15. So the dimensions are length, width, height. The space diagonal formula for a rectangular prism is sqrt(l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2). Oh right, because it's like applying the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions.\n\nLet me compute that. So l is 3, w is 4, h is 15. So the squares would be 3\u00b2=9, 4\u00b2=16, 15\u00b2=225. Adding them up: 9 +16 is 25, plus 225 is 250. So the space diagonal is sqrt(250). Hmm, sqrt(250) can be simplified. Let me think, 250 is 25 times 10, so sqrt(25*10) is 5*sqrt(10). Oh wait, what's the numerical value of that?\n\nI remember that sqrt(10) is approximately 3.1623. So 5 times that would be 15.8115. Looking at the options, option B is 15.8113. That must be the answer. Because the space diagonal is the diameter of the sphere, so that's the diameter.\n\nWait, did I get all that right? Let me double-check. The space diagonal formula is correct? Yes, for a box, it's sqrt(l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2). The calculations: 3 squared is 9, 4 is 16, 15 is 225. Sum is 250. Square root of 250 is indeed 5*sqrt(10), which is about 15.8113. So option B is the correct one. I think that's it.\n",
