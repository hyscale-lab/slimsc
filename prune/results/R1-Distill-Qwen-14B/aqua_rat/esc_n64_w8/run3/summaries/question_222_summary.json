      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. Hmm, so the question is about ages of Ajay, Rahul, and Denis. I'll need to figure out Ajay's current age based on the given conditions.\n\nFirst, let me read the problem again to understand the details. \n\nSo, the first part says: If 6 years are subtracted from the present age of Ajay and the remainder is divided by 18, then the present age of Rahul is obtained. \n\nWait, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me break it down. So, Ajay's current age minus 6 years, and then divide that result by 18. The result of that calculation is Rahul's current age. \n\nSo, mathematically, I can write that as:\nRahul's age = (Ajay's age - 6) / 18.\n\nLet me note that down. So, Rahul = (A - 6)/18, where A is Ajay's age.\n\nThe second part says: Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis. Oh, and Denis's age is given as 5 years. Wait, no, wait. Let me read that again. \"If Rahul is 2 yrs younger to Denis whose age is 5 yrs...\" Oh, no, wait. Wait, does Denis's age being 5 years mean that Denis is 5 years old? Because the way it's phrased is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, the exact wording is: \"Denis whose age is 5 yrs.\" So, that's saying that Denis is 5 years old. So, Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, who is 5. So, Rahul's age is 5 - 2 = 3 years old. Wait, that can't be right because if Rahul is 3, then Ajay's age would be (3 * 18) + 6 = 60. Hmm, okay, but let me make sure.\n\nSo, Denis is 5 years old. Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, which would make Rahul 5 - 2 = 3. So Rahul is 3 years old.\n\nWait, but that seems quite young. Let me double-check. The problem says Rahul is 2 years younger to Denis whose age is 5. So yes, 5 - 2 is 3. So Rahul is 3.\n\nSo now, using the first equation: Rahul = (A - 6)/18. So 3 = (A -6)/18. To find A, multiply both sides by 18: 3 *18 = A -6. 54 = A -6. So, A = 54 +6 = 60. So Ajay's age is 60.\n\nWait, but let me check the options. The options are A)40, B)60, C)70, D)80, E)90. So 60 is option B.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused about the wording again. The part about Denis's age. Let me read it again: \"If Rahul is 2 yrs younger to Denis whose age is 5 yrs, then...\" Oh wait, wait! Wait a second, maybe I misread that. Let me parse that sentence again.\n\nDenis's age is 5 years, and Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis. So Rahul's age is 5 -2 =3. That's correct.\n\nSo, substituting back, Ajay's age is 60. So option B is 60.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit surprised because 60 seems a bit high for someone whose age minus 6 divided by 18 gives Rahul's age as 3. Let me see: (60-6)=54; 54/18=3. Yep, that works.\n\nSo the answer should be B)60.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by analyzing the relationships between the ages of Ajay, Rahul, and Denis.\n\n1. **Rahul's Age**: The problem states that if 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's age and the remainder is divided by 18, the result is Rahul's age. This can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Rahul's age} = \\frac{\\text{Ajay's age} - 6}{18}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Denis's Age**: The problem also states that Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, and Denis's age is 5 years.

This can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ru} = \\frac{\\text{Aj} - 6}{18}\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\text{Ru} \\) is Rahul's age and \\( \\text{Aj} \\) is Ajay's age.\n\n2. **Second condition**: Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, and Denis's age is 5 years. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ru} = 5 - 2 = 3\n   \\]\n\n3. **Substitute Rahul's age into the first equation**:\n   \\[\n   3 = \\frac{\\text{Aj} - 6}{18}\n   \\]\n   Multiply both sides by 18:\n   \\[\n   54 = \\text{Aj} - 6\n   \\]\n   Add 6 to both sides:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Aj} = 60\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verification**: Subtracting 6 from Ajay's age (60 - 6 = 54) and dividing by 18 (54 / 18 = 3) gives Rahul's age as 3, which matches the second condition. Thus, the solution is consistent.\n\nThe present age of Ajay is **60 years**.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to break it down.\n\nThe problem says: If 6 years are subtracted from the present age of Ajay, and the remainder is divided by 18, then the present age of Rahul is obtained. Also, Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, whose age is 5 years. The question is asking for Ajay's present age, and the options are A)40, B)60, C)70, D)80, E)90.\n\nHmm, let's start by identifying the information given. First, let's note down the ages of the people involved.\n\nDenis's age is given as 5 years. Since Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, Rahul's age must be Denis's age minus 2. So Rahul is 5 - 2 = 3 years old. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, wait. Wait, if Denis is 5, Rahul is 2 years younger, so Rahul is 5 - 2 = 3? That's correct. So Rahul is 3 years old.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The problem says Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, and Denis is 5. So yes, Rahul is 3.\n\nNow, the first part of the problem says that if we subtract 6 years from Ajay's current age and then divide the remainder by 18, we get Rahul's present age. So mathematically, that can be written as:\n\n(Ajay's age - 6) / 18 = Rahul's age.\n\nWe already found Rahul's age is 3. So plugging that in:\n\n(Ajay's age - 6) / 18 = 3.\n\nNow, let's solve for Ajay's age. Let me denote Ajay's age as A. So,\n\n(A - 6) / 18 = 3.\n\nMultiply both sides by 18 to get rid of the denominator:\n\nA - 6 = 3 * 18.\n\n3 times 18 is 54, so:\n\nA -6 = 54.\n\nAdd 6 to both sides:\n\nA = 54 + 6 = 60.\n\nSo Ajay's age is 60. Looking at the options, option B is 60. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through each step again.\n\nDenis is 5 years old. Rahul is 2 years younger, so 5-2=3. Correct.\n\nAjay's age minus 6, divided by 18 equals Rahul's age. So (A-6)/18 = 3. Multiply both sides by 18: A-6=54. Add 6: A=60. That seems right.\n\nHmm, but wait, is there any possibility I misread the problem? Let me read the first part again. \"If 6 yrs are subtracted from the present age of Ajay and the remainder is divided by 18, then the present age of Rahul is obtained.\" So yes, that's (A-6)/18 = Rahul's age. Which is 3. So the math checks out.\n\nSo yeah, Ajay is 60 years old. The answer is B.\n",
