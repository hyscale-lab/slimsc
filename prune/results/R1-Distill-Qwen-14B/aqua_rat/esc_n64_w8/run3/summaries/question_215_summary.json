      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about mixing soft drinks. Let's see, the question is asking how many additional gallons of orange juice I need to mix to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink. Hmm, I need to think this through step by step.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding the current situation. The soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water. So, for one gallon of this drink, how much orange juice is there? Well, 40% of one gallon is 0.4 gallons of orange juice. The rest, 0.6 gallons, is water. Got that.\n\nNow, the goal is to have orange juice make up 60% of the soft drink. So, I'm adding more orange juice to this mixture. But wait, when I add more orange juice, the total volume of the soft drink will increase, right? Because I'm adding only orange juice, the water remains the same.\n\nLet me denote the amount of orange juice I need to add as x gallons. So, after adding x gallons, the total orange juice becomes 0.4 + x gallons. The total volume of the soft drink becomes 1 + x gallons because I added x gallons to the original one gallon.\n\nWait, but the water stays the same. Oh wait no, because when I add more orange juice, the total volume increases. So the water was 0.6 gallons initially, and it's still 0.6 gallons after adding x gallons of orange juice. Because I'm not adding any water.\n\nThe concentration of orange juice after adding x gallons should be 60%, which is 0.6 in decimal. So the equation would be: (0.4 + x) / (1 + x) = 0.6.\n\nLet me write that down. So, (0.4 + x) divided by (1 + x) equals 0.6. Now I can solve for x.\n\nMultiplying both sides by (1 + x) gives 0.4 + x = 0.6*(1 + x). Expanding the right side: 0.6*1 is 0.6, and 0.6*x is 0.6x. So equation becomes 0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x.\n\nNow, I'll get all the x terms on one side. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4 + x -0.6x = 0.6. Simplify that to 0.4 + 0.4x = 0.6.\n\nNext, subtract 0.4 from both sides: 0.4x = 0.6 - 0.4. That's 0.4x = 0.2.\n\nDivide both sides by 0.4: x = 0.2 / 0.4. Which is 0.5. So x is 0.5 gallons.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check that because sometimes when you add, the total might change differently. So if I add 0.5 gallons of orange juice, the total orange juice becomes 0.4 + 0.5 = 0.9 gallons. The total volume is 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 gallons. So 0.9 / 1.5 is 0.6, which is 60%. That checks out.\n\nSo the answer should be 0.5 gallons. Looking at the options, option A is 0.5. So the correct answer is A.\n",

Hmm, the question says that one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water. Wait, no, wait\u2014actually, wait a second. Wait, no, one gallon is made of 40% orange juice, so that's 0.4 gallons of OJ and 0.6 gallons of water. Right?\n\nAnd the question is, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink. So, we're adding more OJ to the existing mixture to increase its percentage.\n\nLet me think about this. So initially, there's 0.4 gallons of OJ in 1 gallon total. Let's call the amount of OJ we need to add as x gallons. Because when we add x gallons of OJ, the total OJ becomes 0.4 + x, and the total volume of the drink becomes 1 + x gallons. Because we're adding x gallons to the initial 1 gallon.\n\nWe want the orange juice to be 60% of the soft drink.

So we need to add half a gallon of OJ. Looking at the options, option A is 0.5. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's plug x=0.5 back into the original equation.\n\nLeft side: (0.4 + 0.5) / (1 + 0.5) = (0.9) / (1.5) = 0.6. Which is 60%, so that works.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of ratios. Initially, the ratio is 40% OJ. Adding OJ will increase the OJ content. The final concentration is 60%. So the question is about dilution, but here we're adding the pure substance, so it's more of a concentration problem.\n\nAnother approach: the amount of OJ is 0.4 gallons. Let\u2019s say we add x gallons of OJ. Then total OJ is 0.4 + x, and total volume is 1 + x. The concentration is (0.4 + x)/(1 + x) = 0.6.

We need to find out how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink. The options are A to E, with numbers like 0.5, 1, 1.25, etc.\n\nAlright, so I think this is a mixture problem where we're changing the concentration by adding more of one component. Let me think about how to model this. \n\nRight now, in the original soft drink, there's 40% orange juice. So, in one gallon, that's 0.4 gallons of orange juice and 0.6 gallons of water. Now, we're adding some amount of orange juice. Let's call that amount x gallons. \n\nWhen we add x gallons of orange juice, the total amount of orange juice becomes (0.4 + x) gallons. But wait, the total volume of the soft drink also increases because we're adding more liquid. The initial volume is one gallon, and we're adding x gallons of orange juice, so the new total volume is (1 + x) gallons.\n\nWe want the orange juice to be 60% of the new mixture. So, the concentration after adding should be 60%, or 0.6 in decimal. So, the equation would be:\n\n(0.4 + x) = 0.6 * (1 + x)\n\nLet me write that down. So,\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6 (1 + x)\n\nExpanding the right side: 0.6 * 1 is 0.6, and 0.6 * x is 0.6x. So,\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x\n\nHmm, now I need to solve for x. Let me subtract 0.6x from both sides to get all x terms on one side.\n\n0.4 + x - 0.6x = 0.6\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n0.4 + 0.4x = 0.6\n\nWait, is that right? Because x - 0.6x is 0.4x. So yes.

So adding 0.5 gallons of orange juice would make the concentration 60%.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. The problem says \"how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in.\" So the answer is 0.5 gallons, which is option A.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the ratio. Initially, the ratio is 40% OJ, 60% water. After adding x gallons of OJ, the OJ becomes 60%, and water is 40%. But wait, the amount of water hasn't changed. Initially, there was 0.6 gallons of water.

So,\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6 (1 + x)\n\nExpanding the right side: 0.6 * 1 is 0.6, and 0.6 * x is 0.6x. So,\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x\n\nHmm, now I need to solve for x. Let me subtract 0.6x from both sides to get all x terms on one side.\n\n0.4 + x - 0.6x = 0.6\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n0.4 + 0.4x = 0.6\n\nWait, is that right? Because x - 0.6x is 0.4x. So yes. Now, subtract 0.4 from both sides to isolate the term with x.\n\n0.4x = 0.6 - 0.4\n0.4x = 0.2\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.4:\n\nx = 0.2 / 0.4\nx = 0.5\n\nWait, so x is 0.5 gallons. That's option A. But wait, let me double-check my math because sometimes I might have mixed up the steps.\n\nLet me plug x = 0.5 back into the original equation to see if it works.\n\nLeft side: 0.4 + 0.5 = 0.9\nRight side: 0.6*(1 + 0.5) = 0.6 * 1.5 = 0.9\n\nYes, both sides are equal, so that works. So adding 0.5 gallons of orange juice would make the concentration 60%.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. The problem says \"how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in.\" So the answer is 0.5 gallons, which is option A.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the ratio. Initially, the ratio is 40% OJ, 60% water. After adding x gallons of OJ, the OJ becomes 60%, and water is 40%. But wait, the amount of water hasn't changed. Initially, there was 0.6 gallons of water. After adding OJ, the total volume is 1 + x, so the water is 0.6 gallons, which is 40% of the total.\n\nSo 0.6 = 0.4*(1 + x)\n\nLet me solve this equation. \n\n0.6 / 0.4 = 1 + x\n1.5 = 1 + x\nx = 0.5\n\nSame result. So that's correct. So the answer should be A) 0.5.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that the soft drink initially contains 40% orange juice (OJ) and 60% water. In one gallon of the soft drink, there are 0.4 gallons of OJ and 0.6 gallons of water. Let \\( x \\) represent the additional gallons of OJ to be added. After adding \\( x \\) gallons of OJ, the total volume of the soft drink becomes \\( 1 + x \\) gallons, and the total amount of OJ becomes \\( 0.4 + x \\) gallons.\n\nWe want the OJ to make up 60% of the new mixture. This gives the equation:\n\n\\[\n0.4 + x = 0.6 \\cdot (1 + x)\n\\]\n\nExpanding the right-hand side:\n\n\\[\n0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x\n\\]\n\nSubtracting \\( 0.6x \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n0.4 + 0.4x = 0.6\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 0.4 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n0.4x = 0.2\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 0.4:\n\n\\[\nx = 0.5\n\\]\n\nThus, 0.5 gallons of additional orange juice must be added to achieve the desired concentration. Verifying this result by substituting \\( x = 0.5 \\) back into the original equation confirms that both sides are equal, confirming the solution is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **A) 0.5**.\n\nAnswer: A",

The question is about figuring out how much additional orange juice needs to be added to a gallon of soft drink to make the orange juice content 60% instead of 40%. Hmm, I think I need to set up some kind of equation for this.\n\nWait, the initial mixture is one gallon, right? And it's 40% orange juice and 60% water. So, the amount of orange juice in that gallon is 0.4 gallons, and water is 0.6 gallons. Got it. Now, the goal is to add more orange juice so that orange juice makes up 60% of the total mixture.\n\nLet me think about variables. Let's say we add x gallons of orange juice. Then, the total amount of orange juice becomes (0.4 + x) gallons. But wait, the total volume of the soft drink will also increase because we're adding more liquid. So the total volume becomes (1 + x) gallons.\n\nWe want the orange juice to be 60% of the total mixture. So, the equation should be (0.4 + x) = 0.6 * (1 + x). Does that make sense? Let me write that out.\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6 (1 + x)\n\nExpanding the right side: 0.6 * 1 is 0.6, and 0.6 * x is 0.6x. So the equation becomes:\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x\n\nHmm, now I need to solve for x. Let's subtract 0.6x from both sides:\n\n0.4 + x - 0.6x = 0.6\n\nSimplify the left side: x - 0.6x is 0.4x, so:\n\n0.4 + 0.4x = 0.6\n\nSubtract 0.4 from both sides:\n\n0.4x = 0.2\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.4:\n\nx = 0.2 / 0.4 = 0.5\n\nSo, x is 0.5 gallons. That means we need to add half a gallon of orange juice.\n\nWait, but the initial problem says 'additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in'. So the answer would be 0.5 gallons. Looking at the options, option A is 0.5. So the answer should be A.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

We need to find out how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink. The options are A through E, with E being 2.\n\nHmm, so initially, we have 1 gallon of soft drink. 40% is orange juice, so that's 0.4 gallons of OJ, and 0.6 gallons of water. Now, we're adding more orange juice. Let's call the amount we need to add 'x' gallons. The goal is to have orange juice make up 60% of the new mixture.\n\nWait, when you add x gallons of OJ, the total volume of the soft drink increases, right? Because you're adding more liquid. So the total volume after adding will be 1 + x gallons. Because you started with 1 gallon and added x.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the initial soft drink is 1 gallon, and you're adding x gallons of OJ. So the total becomes 1 + x gallons. But the amount of OJ in the new mixture will be the original 0.4 plus x, because you added x gallons of OJ. The water remains the same, 0.6 gallons, because you're only adding OJ.\n\nSo we want the OJ to be 60% of the total. So the equation should be:\n\n(0.4 + x) = 0.6 * (1 + x)\n\nBecause the OJ is 0.4 + x, and the total is 1 + x. And we want OJ to be 60% of the total, so 0.6*(1+x).\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6*(1 + x)\n\nLet me expand the right side: 0.6 *1 is 0.6, 0.6 *x is 0.6x. So the equation becomes:\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x\n\nNow, let's get all the x terms on one side. Subtract 0.6x from both sides:\n\n0.4 + x - 0.6x = 0.6\n\nSimplify x terms: x - 0.6x is 0.4x.\n\nSo 0.4 + 0.4x = 0.6\n\nNow, subtract 0.4 from both sides:\n\n0.4x = 0.6 - 0.4\n0.4x = 0.2\n\nDivide both sides by 0.4:\n\nx = 0.2 / 0.4\nx = 0.5\n\nSo x is 0.5 gallons. So you need to add 0.5 gallons of orange juice. Looking at the options, option A is 0.5. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If I add 0.5 gallons, the total becomes 1.5 gallons. The OJ is 0.4 + 0.5 = 0.9 gallons. 0.9 / 1.5 is 0.6, which is 60%. That makes sense. So yeah, 0.5 is correct.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about mixing soft drinks. Let me read it again. The question says that one gallon of soft drink is made up of 40% orange juice and 60% water. We need to find out how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink. The options are A through E, with E being 2.\n\nHmm, so initially, we have 1 gallon of soft drink. 40% is orange juice, so that's 0.4 gallons of OJ, and 0.6 gallons of water. Now, we're adding more orange juice. Let's call the amount we need to add 'x' gallons. The goal is to have orange juice make up 60% of the new mixture.\n\nWait, when you add x gallons of OJ, the total volume of the soft drink increases, right? Because you're adding more liquid. So the total volume after adding will be 1 + x gallons. Because you started with 1 gallon and added x.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the initial soft drink is 1 gallon, and you're adding x gallons of OJ. So the total becomes 1 + x gallons. But the amount of OJ in the new mixture will be the original 0.4 plus x, because you added x gallons of OJ. The water remains the same, 0.6 gallons, because you're only adding OJ.\n\nSo we want the OJ to be 60% of the total. So the equation should be:\n\n(0.4 + x) = 0.6 * (1 + x)\n\nBecause the OJ is 0.4 + x, and the total is 1 + x. And we want OJ to be 60% of the total, so 0.6*(1+x).\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6*(1 + x)\n\nLet me expand the right side: 0.6 *1 is 0.6, 0.6 *x is 0.6x. So the equation becomes:\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x\n\nNow, let's get all the x terms on one side. Subtract 0.6x from both sides:\n\n0.4 + x - 0.6x = 0.6\n\nSimplify x terms: x - 0.6x is 0.4x.\n\nSo 0.4 + 0.4x = 0.6\n\nNow, subtract 0.4 from both sides:\n\n0.4x = 0.6 - 0.4\n0.4x = 0.2\n\nDivide both sides by 0.4:\n\nx = 0.2 / 0.4\nx = 0.5\n\nSo x is 0.5 gallons. So you need to add 0.5 gallons of orange juice. Looking at the options, option A is 0.5. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If I add 0.5 gallons, the total becomes 1.5 gallons. The OJ is 0.4 + 0.5 = 0.9 gallons. 0.9 / 1.5 is 0.6, which is 60%. That makes sense. So yeah, 0.5 is correct.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start with 1 gallon of soft drink, where 40% is orange juice (0.4 gallons) and 60% is water (0.6 gallons). Let \\( x \\) represent the additional gallons of orange juice to be added. After adding \\( x \\) gallons of orange juice, the total volume of the soft drink becomes \\( 1 + x \\) gallons. The total amount of orange juice in the mixture becomes \\( 0.4 + x \\) gallons. We want the orange juice to make up 60% of the total mixture, so we set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n0.4 + x = 0.6 \\cdot (1 + x)\n\\]\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n\\[\n0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x\n\\]\n\nSubtracting \\( 0.6x \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n0.4 + 0.4x = 0.6\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 0.4 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n0.4x = 0.2\n\\]\n\nDividing through by 0.4:\n\n\\[\nx = 0.5\n\\]\n\nThus, 0.5 gallons of orange juice need to be added to achieve the desired concentration. Verifying, the total volume becomes \\( 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 \\) gallons, and the orange juice content is \\( 0.4 + 0.5 = 0.9 \\) gallons. The fraction of orange juice is \\( 0.9 / 1.5 = 0.6 \\), or 60%, confirming the solution is correct.\n\nAnswer: A",

So initially, we have one gallon of soft drink. 40% is orange juice, which is 0.4 gallons, and the rest 0.6 gallons is water. I think that's right because 40% of 1 gallon is 0.4.\n\nNow, the problem is asking how much more orange juice we need to add so that the orange juice makes up 60% of the new mixture. Oh right, because adding more orange juice will increase the total percentage of orange juice in the drink.\n\nLet me think about this. Let's denote the additional orange juice we need to add as x gallons. So when we add x gallons of orange juice to the existing mixture, the total volume of the soft drink becomes 1 + x gallons. Because we're adding x gallons to the original one gallon.\n\nIn the new mixture, the amount of orange juice is the original 0.4 gallons plus x gallons. So total orange juice is (0.4 + x) gallons.\n\nWe want this orange juice to be 60% of the total mixture. So the equation should be:\n\n(0.4 + x) = 0.6 * (1 + x)\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because 60% of the total volume should be the orange juice.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6 * (1 + x)\n\nNow, I'll solve for x. Let's expand the right side:\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6 * 1 + 0.6 * x\n0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x\n\nNow, I'll get all the x terms on one side and constants on the other. Subtract 0.6x from both sides:\n\n0.4 + x - 0.6x = 0.6\n0.4 + 0.4x = 0.6\n\nThen, subtract 0.4 from both sides:\n\n0.4x = 0.6 - 0.4\n0.4x = 0.2\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.4:\n\nx = 0.2 / 0.4\nx = 0.5\n\nSo x is 0.5 gallons. Hmm, let me check if that makes sense. \n\nIf I add 0.5 gallons of orange juice to the original 1 gallon, the total becomes 1.5 gallons. The amount of orange juice is 0.4 + 0.5 = 0.9 gallons. \n\nWhat's 0.9 divided by 1.5? Let me calculate that. 0.9 / 1.5 is 0.6, which is 60%. So yes, that works.\n\nWait, the options are A)0.5, B)1, etc. So the answer should be A)0.5.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. So the answer is 0.5 gallons of additional orange juice.\n",
