Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe question says: \"A number is as much greater than 36 as it is less than 86. Find the number.\" Hmm, that's a bit tricky, but let me break it down.\n\nWait, so the number is greater than 36 by a certain amount, and less than 86 by the same amount. So the difference between the number and 36 is the same as the difference between 86 and the number. Oh right, because it's as much greater as it's less. That makes sense.\n\nLet me think about how to represent this. Let's call the number x. So x is greater than 36 by some value, say, d. So x = 36 + d. Similarly, x is less than 86 by the same d. So x = 86 - d. Oh wait, so both expressions equal x. So I can set them equal to each other.\n\nSo 36 + d = 86 - d. Hmm, solving for d. Let's bring like terms together. I'll add d to both sides: 36 + d + d = 86. That's 36 + 2d = 86.\n\nSubtract 36 from both sides: 2d = 86 - 36. 86 minus 36 is 50, right? So 2d = 50. Divide both sides by 2, so d = 25.\n\nWait, so the number x is 36 + 25, which is 61. Alternatively, 86 - 25 is 61. Either way, x is 61. Let me check the options. Option D is 61, so that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Another way to think about it: The number is exactly in the middle between 36 and 86. Because the difference on both sides is the same. So the midpoint would be (36 + 86)/2. Let's calculate that: 36 plus 86 is 122. Divided by 2 is 61. Yep, same result. So that's correct.

Let's call the number x. So, if x is greater than 36 by a certain amount, that amount would be (x - 36). And since it's also less than 86 by the same amount, that would be (86 - x).

Then, I divide both sides by 2 to find x. 122 divided by 2 is 61. So x equals 61.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If x is 61, then 61 -36 is 25. And 86 -61 is also 25. Yeah, that makes sense. So the number is 61. Now looking at the options, option D is 61. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Let me go through the steps again. The equation was x -36 =86 -x. Adding x to both sides: 2x -36 =86. Adding 36: 2x =122. Divide by 2: x=61. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the number is exactly halfway between 36 and 86. Because the distance from 36 to x is the same as from x to 86. So the midpoint would be (36 +86)/2. Let me compute that: 36+86 is 122, divided by 2 is 61. So that's another way to see it. That makes sense. So the number is 61, which is option D.\n\n\nThe problem states that a number \\( x \\) is as much greater than 36 as it is less than 86. This means the difference between \\( x \\) and 36 is equal to the difference between 86 and \\( x \\). This can be written as:\n\n\\[\nx - 36 = 86 - x\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), add \\( x \\) to both sides:\n\n\\[\n2x - 36 = 86\n\\]\n\nNext, add 36 to both sides:\n\n\\[\n2x = 122\n\\]\n\nFinally, divide by 2:\n\n\\[\nx = 61\n\\]\n\nTo verify, \\( 61 - 36 = 25 \\) and \\( 86 - 61 = 25 \\), confirming the solution is correct. Additionally, \\( x \\) is the midpoint between 36 and 86, calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{36 + 86}{2} = 61\n\\]\n\nThus, the number is 61, which corresponds to option D.\n\nAnswer: D",

The number is greater than 36 by a certain amount, and at the same time, it's less than 86 by the same amount.

Find the number.\" Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I think I can figure it out.\n\nWait, let me break it down. So, there's a number. Let's call it 'x'. The problem states that x is greater than 36 by a certain amount, and it's also less than 86 by the same amount. Oh, right, so the difference between x and 36 is the same as the difference between 86 and x. Because it's 'as much greater' and 'as much less'\u2014so the two differences must be equal.\n\nSo mathematically, I can write that as x - 36 = 86 - x. Because the amount by which x exceeds 36 is the same as the amount by which x is less than 86.\n\nWait, let me write that down: x - 36 = 86 - x. Now, I can solve this equation for x. Let's add x to both sides to get rid of the negative x on the right. So, adding x to both sides gives me x + x -36 = 86. That simplifies to 2x -36 =86.\n\nNext, I'll add 36 to both sides to isolate the term with x. So, 2x = 86 + 36. Let's do that addition: 86 +36 is 122. So now I have 2x = 122.\n\nTo find x, I'll divide both sides by 2. So, x = 122 / 2. Doing the division, 122 divided by 2 is 61. So x is 61.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If the number is 61, how much is it greater than 36? 61 minus 36 is 25. And how much less is it than 86? 86 minus 61 is 25. Yep, that's the same. So the number is 61.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 61. So that's the correct answer.\n\nI think I got it right. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me recount the steps:\n\n1. Let x be the number.\n2. x - 36 = 86 - x.\n3. Add x to both sides: 2x -36 =86.\n4. Add 36: 2x =122.\n5. Divide by 2: x=61.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer is D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question says, \"A number is as much greater than 36 as it is less than 86. Find the number.\" Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I think I can figure it out.\n\nWait, let me break it down. So, there's a number. Let's call it 'x'. The problem states that x is greater than 36 by a certain amount, and it's also less than 86 by the same amount. Oh, right, so the difference between x and 36 is the same as the difference between 86 and x. Because it's 'as much greater' and 'as much less'\u2014so the two differences must be equal.\n\nSo mathematically, I can write that as x - 36 = 86 - x. Because the amount by which x exceeds 36 is the same as the amount by which x is less than 86.\n\nWait, let me write that down: x - 36 = 86 - x. Now, I can solve this equation for x. Let's add x to both sides to get rid of the negative x on the right. So, adding x to both sides gives me x + x -36 = 86. That simplifies to 2x -36 =86.\n\nNext, I'll add 36 to both sides to isolate the term with x. So, 2x = 86 + 36. Let's do that addition: 86 +36 is 122. So now I have 2x = 122.\n\nTo find x, I'll divide both sides by 2. So, x = 122 / 2. Doing the division, 122 divided by 2 is 61. So x is 61.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If the number is 61, how much is it greater than 36? 61 minus 36 is 25. And how much less is it than 86? 86 minus 61 is 25. Yep, that's the same. So the number is 61.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 61. So that's the correct answer.\n\nI think I got it right. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes.
