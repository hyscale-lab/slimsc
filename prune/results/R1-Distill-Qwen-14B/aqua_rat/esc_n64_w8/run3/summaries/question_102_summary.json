      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a club where the ages of the members form an arithmetic progression (A.P.), with a common difference of 3 months. The youngest member is 7 years old, and the sum of all their ages is 250. I need to find the number of members in the club.\n\nHmm, arithmetic progression, right. So, in an A.P., each term after the first is obtained by adding a common difference. Here, the common difference is 3 months. Wait, but the ages are given in years, right? The youngest is 7 years. Oh wait, wait, the common difference is 3 months, which is a quarter of a year. So I should probably convert everything into the same units to make calculations easier. Maybe work in months or in years as fractions.\n\nWait, let's think: 3 months is 0.25 years. So the common difference, d, is 0.25 years. The first term, a1, is 7 years. So the ages would be 7, 7.25, 7.5, 7.75, 8, and so on, right?\n\nThe sum of the ages is 250. The formula for the sum of an A.P. is S = n/2 * (2a1 + (n-1)d), where n is the number of terms. Or another version is S = n*(a1 + an)/2, where an is the last term. Either formula should work, but I think the first one might be more straightforward here because I don't know the last term yet.\n\nSo, I can set up the equation:\n\n250 = (n/2) * [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]\n\nSimplify that. Let's compute 2*7 first, which is 14. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n250 = (n/2) * [14 + 0.25(n-1)]\n\nLet me compute that step by step. Let's distribute the 0.25:\n\n14 + 0.25n - 0.25 = 13.75 + 0.25n\n\nSo now the equation is:\n\n250 = (n/2) * (13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the denominator:\n\n500 = n*(13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n500 = 13.75n + 0.25n\u00b2\n\nLet me rearrange this into a standard quadratic equation form. So,\n\n0.25n\u00b2 + 13.75n - 500 = 0\n\nHmm, dealing with decimals can be a bit messy. Maybe multiply every term by 4 to eliminate the decimal. Let's try that:\n\n4 * 0.25n\u00b2 = n\u00b2\n\n4 *13.75n = 55n\n\n4*(-500) = -2000\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nn\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0\n\nNow, this is a quadratic equation in the form an\u00b2 + bn + c =0, where a=1, b=55, c=-2000.\n\nI can solve this using the quadratic formula: n = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a)\n\nPlugging the values in:\n\nb\u00b2 = 55^2 = 3025\n\n4ac =4*1*(-2000) = -8000\n\nSo discriminant D = 3025 -4*1*(-2000) = 3025 +8000 = 11025\n\nWhat's the square root of 11025? Let me think. 105^2 is 11025 because 100^2 is 10000, 105^2 is 10000 + 2*100*5 +5^2 = 10000+1000+25=11025. So sqrt(11025)=105.\n\nSo,\n\nn = [ -55 \u00b1 105 ] / 2\n\nWe have two solutions:\n\nn = (-55 +105)/2 = (50)/2 =25\n\nn= (-55 -105)/2= (-160)/2= -80\n\nBut the number of members can't be negative, so n=25 is the solution.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option C is 25. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check my steps because sometimes I might have made a mistake in calculations.\n\nLet me recheck the quadratic equation. The sum was 250, and the equation was:\n\n250 = (n/2) [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]\n\nSo, 2*7 is 14, correct.\n\nThen, [14 + 0.25(n-1)] = 14 + 0.25n -0.25 =13.75 +0.25n. That's correct.\n\nMultiply by n/2: 250 = n/2 * (13.75 +0.25n)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: 500 = n*(13.75 +0.25n) \u2192 500 = 13.75n +0.25n\u00b2.\n\nMultiply by 4: 2000=55n +n\u00b2 \u2192 n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0. Correct.\n\nSolving that, discriminant is 55^2 +4*2000 = 3025 +8000=11025. sqrt(11025)=105.\n\nSo n=( -55 +105 )/2=50/2=25. So yes, 25 is the solution. That's option C.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let's make sure that the sum actually adds up to 250 when n is 25.\n\nLet me calculate the sum with n=25.\n\na1=7, d=0.25, n=25.\n\nSum S = n/2 [2a1 + (n-1)d]\n\nSo,\n\nS=25/2 [14 +24*0.25]\n\n24 *0.25 is 6.\n\nSo 14 +6 =20.\n\n25/2 *20 = (25 *20)/2 = (500)/2=250. Yes, correct.\n\nSo the answer is 25, option C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a club where the members' ages form an arithmetic progression. Hmm, arithmetic progression, right. The common difference is 3 months. Oh wait, but the youngest is 7 years old, and the sum of all their ages is 250. I need to find how many members are in the club. The options are A)18, B)20, C)25, D)26, E)27.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. I remember that in an arithmetic progression (AP), the sum of the terms can be found using the formula S = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference. Alternatively, another version is S = n*(a1 + an)/2, where a1 is the first term and an is the last term.\n\nWait, but here, the ages are in AP with a common difference of 3 months. But the youngest is 7 years old. So I need to make sure all the units are consistent. Since the common difference is in months and the ages are in years, maybe I should convert everything into months to avoid confusion. Let me think.\n\nThe youngest is 7 years old, which is 7 * 12 = 84 months. The common difference d is 3 months. So each subsequent member is 3 months older than the previous.\n\nLet me denote the number of members as n. The sum of all their ages (in months) would be the sum of the AP in months. Let's compute that.\n\nSum S in months is equal to n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d], where a is the first term (84 months), d is 3 months.\n\nSo S = n/2 * [2*84 + (n-1)*3] = n/2 * [168 + 3(n-1)].\n\nSimplify that: 168 + 3n -3 = 165 + 3n.\n\nSo S = n/2 * (165 + 3n) = (n*(165 + 3n))/2.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the sum of the ages is 250. Wait, is that in years or months? Oh, the problem states the sum is 250, but the units aren't specified. Wait, the initial ages are given in years and months. Hmm. Wait, the sum of the ages is 250. Wait, wait, the question says, \"sum of the ages of all the members is 250\". But the units aren't specified. Wait, the problem says the youngest is 7 years old, and the common difference is 3 months. So the sum is 250, but I'm not sure if it's in years or months. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the sum is in years? Because 250 years would be a huge number for a club. Alternatively, if it's 250 years, that can't be right because 250 years is way too long for a club. So perhaps it's 250 months. Or maybe the sum is 250 years. Hmm, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the sum is in years, but let's think in terms of months.\n\nWait, 250 is the sum in what? Let's assume it's in years. So 250 years. That's a lot for the sum of members' ages. Maybe that's correct. Let's see.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because if each member is, say, 7 years old, and there are 20 members, the sum would be 140 years. If the sum is 250, then 250 years divided by, say, 20 members would be 12.5 years on average. But the members would be varying from 7 upwards. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum is in years, and I should convert all calculations to years. Let me try that.\n\nWait, the common difference is 3 months, which is 0.25 years (since 3/12=0.25). The youngest is 7 years old. So the ages in years are 7, 7.25, 7.5, etc., each increasing by 0.25 years.\n\nThen, the sum S is 250 years. The formula for the sum is S = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d], where a=7, d=0.25.\n\nSo S = n/2 [14 + 0.25(n-1)] = 250.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: n [14 + 0.25(n-1)] = 500.\n\nExpanding: 14n + 0.25n(n-1) = 500.\n\nLet me write that as 0.25n\u00b2 +14n -0.25n =500.\n\nWait, 0.25(n\u00b2 -n) +14n =500.\n\nSimplify: 0.25n\u00b2 -0.25n +14n =500.\n\nCombine like terms: 0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n =500.\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the decimal: n\u00b2 +55n =2000.\n\nSo n\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0.\n\nNow, solving the quadratic equation: n = [-55 \u00b1 sqrt(55\u00b2 +4*2000)] / 2.\n\nCompute discriminant: 55^2 is 3025. 4*2000=8000. So sqrt(3025+8000)=sqrt(11025). What's the square root of 11025? Let's see, 105^2 is 11025 (because 100^2=10000, 105^2=11025). So sqrt is 105.\n\nSo n = [-55 \u00b1105]/2. Since n can't be negative, take positive solution: (50)/2=25.\n\nSo n=25. That's option C.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculations again. Let me see.\n\nWait, the quadratic equation was n\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0.\n\nn = [-55 + sqrt(55\u00b2 +4*2000)] /2.\n\n55\u00b2 is 3025. 4*2000=8000. So 3025+8000=11025. sqrt(11025)=105.\n\nSo [ -55 +105 ] /2 =50/2=25.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, if I had converted everything into months, let's see.\n\nSum S is 250 years. 250 years is 250*12=3000 months.\n\nEach member's age is in months: a=84, d=3.\n\nSum S = n/2 [2*84 + (n-1)*3 ] =n/2 [168 +3n-3] =n/2 (165 +3n) = (n(3n +165))/2.\n\nSet this equal to 3000:\n\n(3n\u00b2 +165n)/2 =3000.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: 3n\u00b2 +165n =6000.\n\nDivide both sides by 3: n\u00b2 +55n =2000.\n\nn\u00b2 +55n -2000=0.\n\nSame equation as before.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about a club where the members' ages form an arithmetic progression. Hmm, arithmetic progression, right. The common difference is 3 months. Oh wait, but the youngest is 7 years old, and the sum of all their ages is 250. I need to find how many members are in the club. The options are A)18, B)20, C)25, D)26, E)27.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. I remember that in an arithmetic progression (AP), the sum of the terms can be found using the formula S = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference. Alternatively, another version is S = n*(a1 + an)/2, where a1 is the first term and an is the last term.\n\nWait, but here, the ages are in AP with a common difference of 3 months. But the youngest is 7 years old. So I need to make sure all the units are consistent. Since the common difference is in months and the ages are in years, maybe I should convert everything into months to avoid confusion. Let me think.\n\nThe youngest is 7 years old, which is 7 * 12 = 84 months. The common difference d is 3 months. So each subsequent member is 3 months older than the previous.\n\nLet me denote the number of members as n. The sum of all their ages (in months) would be the sum of the AP in months. Let's compute that.\n\nSum S in months is equal to n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d], where a is the first term (84 months), d is 3 months.\n\nSo S = n/2 * [2*84 + (n-1)*3] = n/2 * [168 + 3(n-1)].\n\nSimplify that: 168 + 3n -3 = 165 + 3n.\n\nSo S = n/2 * (165 + 3n) = (n*(165 + 3n))/2.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the sum of the ages is 250. Wait, is that in years or months? Oh, the problem states the sum is 250, but the units aren't specified. Wait, the initial ages are given in years and months. Hmm. Wait, the sum of the ages is 250. Wait, wait, the question says, \"sum of the ages of all the members is 250\". But the units aren't specified. Wait, the problem says the youngest is 7 years old, and the common difference is 3 months. So the sum is 250, but I'm not sure if it's in years or months. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the sum is in years? Because 250 years would be a huge number for a club. Alternatively, if it's 250 years, that can't be right because 250 years is way too long for a club. So perhaps it's 250 months. Or maybe the sum is 250 years. Hmm, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the sum is in years, but let's think in terms of months.\n\nWait, 250 is the sum in what? Let's assume it's in years. So 250 years. That's a lot for the sum of members' ages. Maybe that's correct. Let's see.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because if each member is, say, 7 years old, and there are 20 members, the sum would be 140 years. If the sum is 250, then 250 years divided by, say, 20 members would be 12.5 years on average. But the members would be varying from 7 upwards. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum is in years, and I should convert all calculations to years. Let me try that.\n\nWait, the common difference is 3 months, which is 0.25 years (since 3/12=0.25). The youngest is 7 years old. So the ages in years are 7, 7.25, 7.5, etc., each increasing by 0.25 years.\n\nThen, the sum S is 250 years. The formula for the sum is S = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d], where a=7, d=0.25.\n\nSo S = n/2 [14 + 0.25(n-1)] = 250.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: n [14 + 0.25(n-1)] = 500.\n\nExpanding: 14n + 0.25n(n-1) = 500.\n\nLet me write that as 0.25n\u00b2 +14n -0.25n =500.\n\nWait, 0.25(n\u00b2 -n) +14n =500.\n\nSimplify: 0.25n\u00b2 -0.25n +14n =500.\n\nCombine like terms: 0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n =500.\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the decimal: n\u00b2 +55n =2000.\n\nSo n\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0.\n\nNow, solving the quadratic equation: n = [-55 \u00b1 sqrt(55\u00b2 +4*2000)] / 2.\n\nCompute discriminant: 55^2 is 3025. 4*2000=8000. So sqrt(3025+8000)=sqrt(11025). What's the square root of 11025? Let's see, 105^2 is 11025 (because 100^2=10000, 105^2=11025). So sqrt is 105.\n\nSo n = [-55 \u00b1105]/2. Since n can't be negative, take positive solution: (50)/2=25.\n\nSo n=25. That's option C.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculations again. Let me see.\n\nWait, the quadratic equation was n\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0.\n\nn = [-55 + sqrt(55\u00b2 +4*2000)] /2.\n\n55\u00b2 is 3025. 4*2000=8000. So 3025+8000=11025. sqrt(11025)=105.\n\nSo [ -55 +105 ] /2 =50/2=25.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, if I had converted everything into months, let's see.\n\nSum S is 250 years. 250 years is 250*12=3000 months.\n\nEach member's age is in months: a=84, d=3.\n\nSum S = n/2 [2*84 + (n-1)*3 ] =n/2 [168 +3n-3] =n/2 (165 +3n) = (n(3n +165))/2.\n\nSet this equal to 3000:\n\n(3n\u00b2 +165n)/2 =3000.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: 3n\u00b2 +165n =6000.\n\nDivide both sides by 3: n\u00b2 +55n =2000.\n\nn\u00b2 +55n -2000=0.\n\nSame equation as before. So same solution, n=25. So the answer is C)25.\n\nWait, but let me check if 25 members would sum up correctly.\n\nThe first term a=7, last term l= a + (n-1)d =7 +24*(0.25)=7 +6=13 years.\n\nSum is n*(a + l)/2 =25*(7 +13)/2 =25*(20/2)=25*10=250. Exactly the sum given.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the number of members is 25, option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we note that the ages of the club members form an arithmetic progression (AP) with a common difference of 3 months and the youngest member being 7 years old.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a club where the ages of the members are in an arithmetic progression (AP). The common difference is 3 months. The youngest member is 7 years old, and the sum of all their ages is 250. I need to find the number of members. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that an arithmetic progression is a sequence where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference. Here, the difference is 3 months, which is a quarter of a year. So, the common difference d is 0.25 years.\n\nThe youngest member is 7 years old, so that's the first term, a = 7. Let's denote the number of members as n. Since the ages are in AP, the ages would be 7, 7.25, 7.5, ..., up to the nth term.\n\nThe sum of an AP is given by the formula S = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d]. Here, S is 250, a is 7, d is 0.25, and n is what we're looking for.\n\nWait, let me plug in the values I have into the formula. So:\n\n250 = (n/2) * [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]\n\nSimplify inside the brackets first. 2*7 is 14. Then, (n-1)*0.25 is 0.25n - 0.25. So adding those together gives 14 + 0.25n - 0.25. Let me compute that: 14 - 0.25 is 13.75. So the bracket becomes 13.75 + 0.25n.\n\nSo the equation now is 250 = (n/2) * (13.75 + 0.25n). Let's write that out:\n\n250 = (n/2) * (13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nHmm, let's multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the denominator. That gives:\n\n500 = n * (13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nExpanding the right side: 13.75n + 0.25n\u00b2. So the equation becomes:\n\n0.25n\u00b2 + 13.75n - 500 = 0\n\nHmm, dealing with decimals can be a bit messy. Let me multiply the entire equation by 4 to eliminate the decimals. 0.25 *4 is 1, 13.75 *4 is 55, and 500 *4 is 2000. So the equation becomes:\n\nn\u00b2 + 55n - 2000 = 0\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation: n\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0. To solve for n, I can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is n = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a). Here, a=1, b=55, c=-2000.\n\nCalculating the discriminant first: D = b\u00b2 -4ac = 55\u00b2 -4*1*(-2000) = 3025 + 8000 = 11025.\n\nThe square root of 11025 is... let me think. 105 squared is 11025 because 100\u00b2 is 10000, and 105\u00b2 is 10000 + 2*100*5 + 5\u00b2 = 10000 + 1000 +25 = 11025. So sqrt(11025)=105.\n\nSo, n = [-55 \u00b1 105]/2. Let's compute both possibilities.\n\nFirst, (-55 +105)/2 = (50)/2=25. Second, (-55 -105)/2= (-160)/2 = -80. But the number of members can't be negative, so n=25 is the only valid solution.\n\nWait, but the options are A)18, B)20, C)25, D)26, E)27. So option C is 25. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in the arithmetic somewhere.\n\nLet me retrace. The sum formula: S = n/2 [2a + (n-1)d]. Yes, that's correct. So 250 = n/2 [14 + (n-1)*0.25]. That's correct.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: 500 = n [14 + 0.25n - 0.25] \u2192 14-0.25 is 13.75. So 500 =n (13.75 +0.25n). Correct.\n\nMultiply by 4: 2000 =4n(13.75 +0.25n) \u2192 2000 = 55n +n\u00b2. So equation is n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0.\n\nQuadratic formula: n = [-55 \u00b1 sqrt(55\u00b2 +4*2000)] /2. Wait, wait, wait, 55\u00b2 is 3025, 4ac is 4*1*2000=8000. So 3025 +8000=11025, sqrt is 105. So yes, n=( -55 +105)/2=50/2=25.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So 25 members. So the correct option is C.\n",

Yes, that's correct. So 250 = n/2 [14 + (n-1)*0.25]. That's correct.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: 500 = n [14 + 0.25n - 0.25] \u2192 14-0.25 is 13.75. So 500 =n (13.75 +0.25n). Correct.\n\nMultiply by 4: 2000 =4n(13.75 +0.25n) \u2192 2000 = 55n +n\u00b2. So equation is n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0.\n\nQuadratic formula: n = [-55 \u00b1 sqrt(55\u00b2 +4*2000)] /2. Wait, wait, wait, 55\u00b2 is 3025, 4ac is 4*1*2000=8000. So 3025 +8000=11025, sqrt is 105. So yes, n=( -55 +105)/2=50/2=25.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So 25 members. So the correct option is C.\n\n\nThe problem involves a club where the ages of the members are in an arithmetic progression (AP) with a common difference of 3 months (0.25 years). The youngest member is 7 years old, and the sum of all ages is 250. The goal is to find the number of members, \\( n \\).\n\nThe sum of an AP is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{n}{2} \\left[ 2a + (n-1)d \\right]\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( S = 250 \\), \\( a = 7 \\), and \\( d = 0.25 \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says: A club consists of members whose ages are in an arithmetic progression (A.P.), and the common difference is 3 months. The youngest member is 7 years old, and the sum of all their ages is 250. We need to find the number of members in the club. The options are A)18, B)20, C)25, D)26, E)27.\n\nHmm, right. So, arithmetic progression, common difference of 3 months. Let's think about the details. The youngest is 7 years old, so that's the first term. The ages go up by 3 months each time. So each next member is 3 months older than the previous one.\n\nWait, but the sum of all ages is 250. So we need to find the number of terms, n, in this A.P. such that the sum is 250.\n\nFirst, let's make sure all the units are consistent. The common difference is in months, but the ages are given in years. So perhaps I should convert everything to the same unit. Let's convert the ages to months to make it easier, or maybe keep everything in years but adjust the common difference.\n\nWait, 3 months is a quarter of a year. So 3 months = 0.25 years. So the common difference is 0.25 years. The youngest is 7 years old, so the first term a1 is 7.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic progression is given by the formula S_n = n/2 * (2a1 + (n-1)d). Alternatively, it can also be written as S_n = n*(a1 + an)/2, where an is the nth term.\n\nSo let's plug in the numbers we have. The sum S is 250, a1 is 7, d is 0.25 years.\n\nSo, S_n = (n/2) * [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25] = 250.\n\nSimplify this equation:\n\nn/2 * [14 + 0.25(n-1)] = 250\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\nn * [14 + 0.25(n-1)] = 500\n\nLet me compute what's inside the brackets. 14 is a constant, and 0.25*(n-1) is 0.25n - 0.25.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nn * (14 + 0.25n - 0.25) = 500\n\nSimplify 14 - 0.25 = 13.75, so:\n\nn*(13.75 + 0.25n) = 500\n\nMultiply through:\n\nn*0.25n + 13.75n = 500\n\nWhich is:\n\n0.25n\u00b2 + 13.75n - 500 = 0\n\nHmm, that's a quadratic equation. Let's write it as:\n\n0.25n\u00b2 + 13.75n - 500 = 0\n\nIt might be easier to multiply all terms by 4 to eliminate the decimal:\n\n4*(0.25n\u00b2) = n\u00b2\n\n4*(13.75n) = 55n\n\n4*(-500) = -2000\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nn\u00b2 + 55n - 2000 = 0\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, 4 * 0.25 is 1, so 0.25n\u00b2 *4 is n\u00b2. 13.75 *4 is 55. 500*4 is 2000. So yes, n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the original equation after multiplying by 4 is:\n\nn\u00b2 +55n -2000=0.\n\nWait, let me check the steps again. Because earlier, when I multiplied the equation by 4, the 0.25n\u00b2 becomes n\u00b2, 13.75n becomes 55n, and 500 becomes 2000. So the equation is:\n\nn\u00b2 +55n -2000=0.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The initial equation after moving everything to one side was 0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n -500=0. Multiply by 4: 4*(0.25n\u00b2) = n\u00b2, 4*(13.75n)=55n, 4*(-500)=-2000. So yes, n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0.\n\nNow, solving this quadratic equation for n.\n\nThe quadratic formula is n = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a)\n\nHere, a=1, b=55, c=-2000.\n\nCompute the discriminant:\n\nb\u00b2 -4ac = 55\u00b2 -4*(1)*(-2000) = 3025 + 8000 = 11025.\n\nThe square root of 11025. Hmm, what is 105\u00b2? 105*105=11025. Yes, because 100\u00b2 is 10000, 105\u00b2 is 11025.\n\nSo sqrt(11025) = 105.\n\nThus, n = [ -55 \u00b1 105 ] / 2.\n\nWe have two solutions:\n\nn = (-55 + 105)/2 = (50)/2 = 25\n\nn = (-55 -105)/2 = (-160)/2 = -80\n\nSince the number of members can't be negative, we take n=25.\n\nSo the number of members is 25, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me compute the sum with n=25.\n\nFirst term a1=7, d=0.25, n=25.\n\nSum S = (25/2) [2*7 + (25-1)*0.25]\n\nCalculate inside the brackets: 14 + 24 * 0.25.\n\n24 * 0.25 is 6, so 14 +6=20.\n\nSo S = (25/2)*20 = 25 *10 = 250. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be 25, option C.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me check the options again. The options are A)18, B)20, C)25, D)26, E)27.\n\nSo C is 25, which matches our calculation.\n\nHmm, but another thought: Did I convert the common difference correctly into years?\n\nWait, 3 months is 0.25 years, yes. So the calculations are correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the common difference is 3 months, so in terms of months, the difference is 3, and the first term is 7 years, which is 84 months.\n\nWait, maybe another approach is to convert everything to months to avoid dealing with decimals.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nAges are in A.P. with d=3 months. Youngest is 7 years = 7*12=84 months.\n\nSum of all ages in months is 250 years. Wait, wait, 250 years? No, the sum is 250, but in what unit? The problem says the sum is 250. Oh wait, the question says the sum is 250. But the ages are in years, but if I convert to months, the sum would be 250 years? No, wait, wait.\n\nWait, the question says the sum of the ages is 250. So, I think the sum is 250 years in total. So, if I convert each age to months, the sum would be 250 *12= 3000 months.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a better way. Let me try that.\n\nEach age is in years, but let's express them in months.\n\na1 = 7 years = 84 months.\n\nd = 3 months.\n\nSum in months would be 250 years = 250 *12 = 3000 months.\n\nSo, sum S_n (in months) is 3000.\n\nThe formula for sum in months would be:\n\nS_n = n/2 [2a1 + (n-1)d] where a1 is in months and d is in months.\n\nSo,\n\n3000 = (n/2) [2*84 + (n-1)*3]\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n2*84 = 168.\n\n(n-1)*3 = 3n -3.\n\nSo,\n\n3000 = (n/2) [168 + 3n -3] = (n/2)(165 +3n )\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n6000 = n(3n +165)\n\nWhich gives:\n\n3n\u00b2 +165n -6000 =0\n\nDivide all terms by 3 to simplify:\n\nn\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0\n\nWhich is the same quadratic equation as before. So n=25 is the solution. So same result.\n\nSo yes, the number of members is 25. So the correct option is C.\n",

The sum S is 250, a1 is 7, d is 0.25 years.\n\nSo, S_n = (n/2) * [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25] = 250.\n\nSimplify this equation:\n\nn/2 * [14 + 0.25(n-1)] = 250\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\nn * [14 + 0.25(n-1)] = 500\n\nLet me compute what's inside the brackets. 14 is a constant, and 0.25*(n-1) is 0.25n - 0.25.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nn * (14 + 0.25n - 0.25) = 500\n\nSimplify 14 - 0.25 = 13.75, so:\n\nn*(13.75 + 0.25n) = 500\n\nMultiply through:\n\nn*0.25n + 13.75n = 500\n\nWhich is:\n\n0.25n\u00b2 + 13.75n - 500 = 0\n\nHmm, that's a quadratic equation.

The sum of ages is 250 years.\n\n2. **Sum Formula**: The sum of an A.P. is given by:\n   \\[\n   S_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\left[ 2a_1 + (n-1)d \\right]\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(a_1 = 7\\), \\(d = 0.25\\), and \\(S_n = 250\\):\n   \\[\n   250 = \\frac{n}{2} \\left[ 14 + 0.25(n-1) \\right]\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify**: Multiply through by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n   \\[\n   n \\left[ 14 + 0.25(n-1) \\right] = 500\n   \\]\n   Expand and simplify:\n   \\[\n   n \\left[ 13.75 + 0.25n \\right] = 500\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   0.25n^2 + 13.75n - 500 = 0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Quadratic Equation**: Multiply through by 4 to eliminate decimals:\n   \\[\n   n^2 + 55n - 2000 = 0\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\(n\\)**: Use the quadratic formula \\(n = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 55\\), and \\(c = -2000\\):\n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{-55 \\pm \\sqrt{55^2 - 4(1)(-2000)}}{2(1)}\n   \\]\n   Compute the discriminant:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{3025 + 8000} = \\sqrt{11025} = 105\n   \\]\n   Thus:\n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{-55 + 105}{2} = 25 \\quad \\text{(since \\(n\\) cannot be negative)}.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Verification**: Check the sum with \\(n = 25\\):\n   \\[\n   S_{25} = \\frac{25}{2} \\left[ 2(7) + (25-1)(0.25) \\right] = \\frac{25}{2} \\left[ 14 + 6 \\right] = \\frac{25}{2} \\cdot 20 = 250\n   \\]\n   The calculation confirms \\(n = 25\\).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe number of members in the club is **25**, which corresponds to option **C**.\n\nAnswer: C",

Hmm, the question is about a club where the ages of the members form an arithmetic progression, or A.P., right? And the common difference is 3 months. Oh wait, and the youngest member is just 7 years old. The sum of all their ages is 250. I need to find the number of members in the club.\n\nWait, so the ages are in A.P., with a common difference of 3 months. That means each subsequent member is 3 months older than the previous one. So, if the first term (youngest) is 7 years, then the next is 7 years and 3 months, then 7 years and 6 months, and so on.\n\nBut wait, how are the ages represented? Because 7 years is 7, but 3 months would be 0.25 years. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to convert everything into months to avoid dealing with decimals. Let me think: 7 years is 7 * 12 = 84 months. The common difference is 3 months. So each term increases by 3 months.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should work in years. 3 months is 0.25 years. So, the common difference d is 0.25 years. The first term a1 is 7 years. So the ages are 7, 7.25, 7.5, 7.75, 8, etc.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic progression is given by the formula S = n/2 * [2a1 + (n-1)*d], where n is the number of terms.

Let me multiply every term by 4 to eliminate the decimal:\n\n4 * 0.25n\u00b2 = n\u00b2\n4 *13.75n = 55n\n4*(-500) = -2000\n\nSo now the equation is:\n\nn\u00b2 + 55n - 2000 = 0\n\nWait, wait, let me double-check that multiplication. 13.75 *4 is 55, right? 13 *4 is 52, 0.75 *4 is 3, so 52+3=55. Yep. And 500*4 is 2000, but it was -500, so becomes -2000.\n\nNow, solving the quadratic equation n\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, n = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a). Here, a=1, b=55, c=-2000.\n\nDiscriminant D = 55\u00b2 -4*1*(-2000) = 3025 +8000= 11025.\n\nThe square root of 11025 is... Let's see. 105 squared is 11025 because 100^2=10000, 105^2=11025. Yep.\n\nSo, sqrt(11025)=105.\n\nSo, n = [ -55 \u00b1105 ] / 2.\n\nWe can discard the negative solution because number of members can't be negative.\n\nSo, n = ( -55 + 105 ) /2 = (50)/2=25.\n\nAlternatively, ( -55 -105 )/2= -160/2= -80, which is negative, so we ignore that.\n\nSo, n=25. Let me check the options. Option C is 25. So, the answer should be C)25.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let me plug n=25 back into the sum formula to see if it gives 250.\n\nSum S = n/2 [2a1 + (n-1)d]\n\nn=25, a1=7, d=0.25.\n\nSo,\n\nS = 25/2 [2*7 +24 *0.25]\n\nCompute 2*7=14. 24 *0.25 is 6.

So, first, the ages are in A.P. with a common difference of 3 months. That means each subsequent member is 3 months older than the previous one.\n\nThe first term of the A.P., which is the youngest member, is 7 years.

Hmm, but the ages are in years. Wait, no, because the youngest is 7 years, and the common difference is 3 months. So perhaps I should keep everything in years, but the common difference is 3/12 years, which is 0.25 years.\n\nWait, that's a better approach. Let me re-calculate everything in years.\n\nSo, the first term a1 = 7 years.\n\nCommon difference d = 3 months = 3/12 = 0.25 years.\n\nNumber of terms n is what we need to find.\n\nSum of the ages S_n = 250 years.\n\nThe formula for the sum of an A.P. is S_n = n/2 * [2a1 + (n-1)d].\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n250 = (n/2) * [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n2*7 is 14, and (n-1)*0.25 is 0.25(n-1).\n\nSo, 250 = (n/2) * [14 + 0.25(n-1)]\n\nLet me compute 0.25(n-1): that's 0.25n - 0.25.\n\nSo the bracket becomes 14 + 0.25n - 0.25 = (14 - 0.25) + 0.25n = 13.75 + 0.25n.\n\nSo,\n\n250 = (n/2) * (13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n500 = n*(13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n500 = 13.75n + 0.25n\u00b2\n\nLet me rearrange this equation to form a quadratic equation:\n\n0.25n\u00b2 + 13.75n - 500 = 0\n\nHmm, dealing with decimals can be tricky.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe club has members whose ages form an arithmetic progression (A.P.), with a common difference of 3 months. The youngest member is 7 years old, and the sum of all their ages is 250. I need to find the number of members.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. So, first, the ages are in A.P. with a common difference of 3 months. That means each subsequent member is 3 months older than the previous one.\n\nThe first term of the A.P., which is the youngest member, is 7 years. But wait, since the common difference is in months, I should probably convert everything into the same units to avoid confusion. Let me think\u2014should I convert everything to months or keep it in years? Maybe months would be better because the common difference is in months.\n\nWait, 3 months is a quarter of a year. So 7 years is 7 * 12 = 84 months. The common difference d is 3 months.\n\nSo, the first term a1 is 84 months. The common difference is 3 months.\n\nThe sum of the ages is 250. But wait, the sum is given in years? Wait, the problem says the sum of the ages is 250. Oh, wait, the question doesn't specify the units for the sum. Wait, the problem says the sum is 250. Hmm, but the ages are in years. Wait, no, because the youngest is 7 years, and the common difference is 3 months. So perhaps I should keep everything in years, but the common difference is 3/12 years, which is 0.25 years.\n\nWait, that's a better approach. Let me re-calculate everything in years.\n\nSo, the first term a1 = 7 years.\n\nCommon difference d = 3 months = 3/12 = 0.25 years.\n\nNumber of terms n is what we need to find.\n\nSum of the ages S_n = 250 years.\n\nThe formula for the sum of an A.P. is S_n = n/2 * [2a1 + (n-1)d].\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n250 = (n/2) * [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n2*7 is 14, and (n-1)*0.25 is 0.25(n-1).\n\nSo, 250 = (n/2) * [14 + 0.25(n-1)]\n\nLet me compute 0.25(n-1): that's 0.25n - 0.25.\n\nSo the bracket becomes 14 + 0.25n - 0.25 = (14 - 0.25) + 0.25n = 13.75 + 0.25n.\n\nSo,\n\n250 = (n/2) * (13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n500 = n*(13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n500 = 13.75n + 0.25n\u00b2\n\nLet me rearrange this equation to form a quadratic equation:\n\n0.25n\u00b2 + 13.75n - 500 = 0\n\nHmm, dealing with decimals can be tricky. Maybe I can eliminate them by multiplying the entire equation by 4 to make the coefficients integers.\n\n0.25 *4 =1, 13.75 *4=55, 500*4=2000.\n\nSo,\n\nn\u00b2 + 55n - 2000 = 0\n\nWait, wait. Let me check:\n\n0.25n\u00b2 *4 = n\u00b2\n\n13.75n *4 = 55n\n\n500 *4 = 2000. But since it's 0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n -500 =0, when multiplied by 4, it becomes n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\nn\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0\n\nNow, I can solve this quadratic equation for n.\n\nThe quadratic formula is n = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a)\n\nHere, a=1, b=55, c=-2000.\n\nCalculating discriminant D:\n\nD = 55\u00b2 -4*1*(-2000)\n\n55^2 is 3025.\n\n4*1*2000 = 8000.\n\nSo D=3025 +8000=11025.\n\nWhat's the square root of 11025? Let me think. 105^2 is 11025 because 100^2 is 10000, 105^2 is 11025 (since 100+5)^2=10000 + 1000 +25= 11025.\n\nSo sqrt(11025)=105.\n\nThus,\n\nn = [ -55 \u00b1105 ] / (2*1)\n\nWe have two solutions:\n\nn = (-55 +105)/2 = (50)/2=25\n\nn = (-55 -105)/2 = (-160)/2= -80\n\nSince the number of members can't be negative, n=25.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, C is 25.

The youngest member is 7 years old, and the total sum of all their ages is 250. I need to find how many members are in the club.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. First, I remember that in an A.P., each term increases by a common difference. Here, the difference is 3 months, which is a quarter of a year. So if I convert all ages into months, maybe calculations will be easier. Or wait, maybe it's better to keep everything in years but convert the common difference to a fraction. Let me think.\n\nThe youngest is 7 years old. Let's say there are n members. So the ages would be 7, 7 + 0.25, 7 + 0.5, 7 + 0.75, and so on, right? Because each step is 3 months, which is 0.25 years.\n\nThe formula for the sum of an A.P. is S = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d], where a is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms.\n\nWait, let's write down what we know:\n- a = 7 years\n- d = 0.25 years (since 3 months is a quarter of a year)\n- S = 250 years\n- n = ?\n\nSo plugging into the sum formula: 250 = (n/2) * [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]\n\nSimplify that equation. Let's compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 2*7: that's 14.\n\nThen, (n-1)*0.25. Let's keep it as is for now.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n250 = (n/2) * [14 + 0.25(n - 1)]\n\nLet me multiply it out. Let's expand the terms inside the brackets first.\n\n14 + 0.25n - 0.25 = (14 - 0.25) + 0.25n = 13.75 + 0.25n.\n\nSo now the equation is:\n\n250 = (n/2) * (13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nLet me distribute the (n/2):\n\n250 = (n/2)*13.75 + (n/2)*0.25n\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n(n/2)*13.75 = 13.75n/2 = 6.875n\n\n(n/2)*0.25n = 0.25n\u00b2 / 2 = 0.125n\u00b2\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n250 = 6.875n + 0.125n\u00b2\n\nLet me rewrite this as:\n\n0.125n\u00b2 + 6.875n - 250 = 0\n\nHmm, quadratic equation in n. Let's make it easier by multiplying both sides by 8 to eliminate the decimals. Wait, 0.125 is 1/8, so if I multiply each term by 8:\n\n8*(0.125n\u00b2) = n\u00b2\n8*(6.875n) = 55n (because 6.875 * 8 = 55)\n8*(-250) = -2000\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nn\u00b2 + 55n - 2000 = 0\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication. 6.875 *8 is indeed 55 because 6*8=48, 0.875*8=7, so 48+7=55. And 0.125*8=1, so yes, the coefficients are correct.\n\nNow, solving the quadratic equation: n\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0\n\nWe can use the quadratic formula: n = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a), where a=1, b=55, c=-2000.\n\nCalculate the discriminant first:\n\nDiscriminant D = 55\u00b2 -4*1*(-2000) = 3025 + 8000 = 11025.\n\nWhat's sqrt(11025)? Let's see. 105 squared is 11025 because 100\u00b2 is 10000, 105\u00b2 is 10000 + 2*100*5 +5\u00b2= 10000+1000+25=11025. So sqrt(11025)=105.\n\nSo the solutions are:\n\nn = [-55 \u00b1 105]/2\n\nWe have two possible solutions:\n\nn = (-55 +105)/2 = 50/2 =25\n\nn = (-55 -105)/2 = (-160)/2 = -80\n\nBut n can't be negative, so n=25 is the solution.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations because the options given include 25 as option C.\n\nBut wait, let me re-examine the steps for any possible errors.\n\nWait, when I converted 3 months into years, I used 0.25 years. That's correct.\n\nThen, the sum formula is correct. Plugging into the sum equation, 250 = (n/2)[2*7 + (n-1)*0.25], which is correct.\n\nSo the equation setup is correct.\n\nBut when I multiplied 250 = (n/2)(14 +0.25(n-1)), I expanded it correctly. Let me recheck that step.\n\n14 +0.25(n-1) =14 +0.25n -0.25 =13.75 +0.25n. Correct.\n\nSo 250 = (n/2)(13.75 +0.25n)\n\nThen, 250 = (n/2)*13.75 + (n/2)*0.25n \u2192 6.875n +0.125n\u00b2. Correct.\n\nThen multiplying by 8: 0.125n\u00b2 *8 =n\u00b2, 6.875n *8=55n, 250*8=2000 \u2192 so equation becomes n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0. Correct.\n\nQuadratic solution: correct.\n\nSo n=25 is the solution. Looking back at the options, option C is 25. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure that 25 members actually sum up to 250.\n\nLet me compute the sum with n=25.\n\nThe first term a=7, common difference d=0.25, n=25.\n\nSum S = (25/2)[2*7 + (25-1)*0.25] = (25/2)[14 + 24*0.25]\n\n24 * 0.25 is 6. So 14+6=20.\n\nSo S= (25/2)*20 =25 *10=250. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the number of members is 25, which is option C.\n",

Let's compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 2*7: that's 14.\n\nThen, (n-1)*0.25. Let's keep it as is for now.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n250 = (n/2) * [14 + 0.25(n - 1)]\n\nLet me multiply it out. Let's expand the terms inside the brackets first.\n\n14 + 0.25n - 0.25 = (14 - 0.25) + 0.25n = 13.75 + 0.25n.\n\nSo now the equation is:\n\n250 = (n/2) * (13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nLet me distribute the (n/2):\n\n250 = (n/2)*13.75 + (n/2)*0.25n\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n(n/2)*13.75 = 13.75n/2 = 6.875n\n\n(n/2)*0.25n = 0.25n\u00b2 / 2 = 0.125n\u00b2\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n250 = 6.875n + 0.125n\u00b2\n\nLet me rewrite this as:\n\n0.125n\u00b2 + 6.875n - 250 = 0\n\nHmm, quadratic equation in n. Let's make it easier by multiplying both sides by 8 to eliminate the decimals. Wait, 0.125 is 1/8, so if I multiply each term by 8:\n\n8*(0.125n\u00b2) = n\u00b2\n8*(6.875n) = 55n (because 6.875 * 8 = 55)\n8*(-250) = -2000\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nn\u00b2 + 55n - 2000 = 0\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication. 6.875 *8 is indeed 55 because 6*8=48, 0.875*8=7, so 48+7=55. And 0.125*8=1, so yes, the coefficients are correct.\n\nNow, solving the quadratic equation: n\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0\n\nWe can use the quadratic formula: n = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a), where a=1, b=55, c=-2000.\n\nCalculate the discriminant first:\n\nDiscriminant D = 55\u00b2 -4*1*(-2000) = 3025 + 8000 = 11025.\n\nWhat's sqrt(11025)? Let's see. 105 squared is 11025 because 100\u00b2 is 10000, 105\u00b2 is 10000 + 2*100*5 +5\u00b2= 10000+1000+25=11025. So sqrt(11025)=105.\n\nSo the solutions are:\n\nn = [-55 \u00b1 105]/2\n\nWe have two possible solutions:\n\nn = (-55 +105)/2 = 50/2 =25\n\nn = (-55 -105)/2 = (-160)/2 = -80\n\nBut n can't be negative, so n=25 is the solution.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations because the options given include 25 as option C.\n\nBut wait, let me re-examine the steps for any possible errors.\n\nWait, when I converted 3 months into years, I used 0.25 years. That's correct.\n\nThen, the sum formula is correct. Plugging into the sum equation, 250 = (n/2)[2*7 + (n-1)*0.25], which is correct.\n\nSo the equation setup is correct.\n\nBut when I multiplied 250 = (n/2)(14 +0.25(n-1)), I expanded it correctly. Let me recheck that step.\n\n14 +0.25(n-1) =14 +0.25n -0.25 =13.75 +0.25n. Correct.\n\nSo 250 = (n/2)(13.75 +0.25n)\n\nThen, 250 = (n/2)*13.75 + (n/2)*0.25n \u2192 6.875n +0.125n\u00b2. Correct.\n\nThen multiplying by 8: 0.125n\u00b2 *8 =n\u00b2, 6.875n *8=55n, 250*8=2000 \u2192 so equation becomes n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0. Correct.\n\nQuadratic solution: correct.\n\nSo n=25 is the solution. Looking back at the options, option C is 25. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure that 25 members actually sum up to 250.\n\nLet me compute the sum with n=25.\n\nThe first term a=7, common difference d=0.25, n=25.\n\nSum S = (25/2)[2*7 + (25-1)*0.25] = (25/2)[14 + 24*0.25]\n\n24 * 0.25 is 6. So 14+6=20.\n\nSo S= (25/2)*20 =25 *10=250. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the number of members is 25, which is option C.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the number of members in a club where their ages form an arithmetic progression (A.P.) with a common difference of 3 months (0.25 years). The youngest member is 7 years old, and the total sum of all ages is 250 years. Using the formula for the sum of an A.P., \\( S = \\frac{n}{2} \\cdot [2a + (n-1)d] \\), where \\( a = 7 \\), \\( d = 0.25 \\), and \\( S = 250 \\), the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n250 = \\frac{n}{2} \\cdot [14 + 0.25(n-1)]\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n250 = \\frac{n}{2} \\cdot (13.75 + 0.25n)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n250 = 6.875n + 0.125n^2\n\\]\n\nMultiplying through by 8 to eliminate decimals:\n\n\\[\nn^2 + 55n - 2000 = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, \\( n = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\), with \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 55 \\), and \\( c = -2000 \\), gives:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-55 \\pm \\sqrt{55^2 - 4(1)(-2000)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-55 \\pm 105}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis yields two solutions: \\( n = 25 \\) and \\( n = -80 \\). Since \\( n \\) cannot be negative, \\( n = 25 \\).\n\nVerifying with \\( n = 25 \\), the sum of ages is:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{25}{2} \\cdot [2(7) + (25-1)(0.25)] = \\frac{25}{2} \\cdot 20 = 250\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of members is 25, which corresponds to option C.\n\nAnswer: C",

So the common difference is 3 months. The youngest member is 7 years old, and the sum of all their ages is 250. I need to find the number of members.\n\nWait, let's break it down. So the ages are in AP, with a common difference of 3 months. The first term is the youngest member's age, which is 7 years. But wait, 7 years is 84 months, right? Because 7 multiplied by 12 is 84. So maybe I should convert everything into months to avoid dealing with fractions when adding.\n\nSo the first term, a1, is 84 months. The common difference, d, is 3 months. So each subsequent member is 3 months older than the previous.\n\nThe sum of the ages is 250 years. Wait, but 250 years is a lot. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the sum is given as 250. But the units here are a bit ambiguous. Wait, the problem says the sum is 250. But the ages are in years, so the sum is 250 years? That doesn't make much sense for a club because that would mean each member's age is part of a sum that's 250 years. But let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum is 250 years? Or is it 250 months? Or maybe it's in years. Hmm, the problem statement says the sum of the ages of all the members is 250. So 250 years? That seems extremely high for a club. Wait, unless the members are all over a very long period. But that seems unlikely. Maybe I made a mistake in the unit conversion.\n\nWait, perhaps it's 250 years. So the sum of all the members' ages is 250 years. So let's proceed with that.\n\nBut wait, let's think again. Let me make sure. The youngest is 7 years, the next would be 7.25 years (since 3 months is a quarter of a year), then 7.5, and so on. So the ages are 7, 7.25, 7.5, etc.\n\nSo the sum of an arithmetic progression is given by the formula: S = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d], where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the sum is 250, which is in years. So let me stick with years.\n\nWait, but if I use years, the common difference is 3 months, which is 0.25 years. So d = 0.25.\n\nSo the sum S is 250 = n/2 [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25].\n\nLet me write that equation down.\n\n250 = (n/2) [14 + 0.25(n-1)].\n\nSimplify the inside: 14 + 0.25n - 0.25 = 13.75 + 0.25n.\n\nSo the equation becomes 250 = (n/2) (13.75 + 0.25n).\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: 500 = n (13.75 + 0.25n).\n\nSo 500 = 13.75n + 0.25n\u00b2.\n\nLet me rewrite this as 0.25n\u00b2 + 13.75n - 500 = 0.\n\nHmm, solving a quadratic equation. Maybe I can multiply all terms by 4 to eliminate the decimal.\n\n4 * 0.25n\u00b2 = n\u00b2, 4 *13.75n = 55n, 4*(-500) = -2000.\n\nSo the equation becomes n\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0.\n\nNow, I can use the quadratic formula: n = [-55 \u00b1 sqrt(55\u00b2 + 4*2000)] /2.\n\nWait, 55 squared is 3025. 4*2000 is 8000. So sqrt(3025 +8000)=sqrt(11025).\n\nWhat's sqrt(11025)? Let me think. 100 squared is 10,000. 105 squared is 11,025. Oh, right! Because 105 *105 = 11025.\n\nSo sqrt(11025) is 105.\n\nSo n = [-55 \u00b1105 ] / 2.\n\nWe can ignore the negative solution because number of members can't be negative. So ( -55 +105 )=50. 50/2=25.\n\nSo n=25. So option C is 25, which would be the number of members.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Let me plug n=25 into the sum formula.\n\nSum = (25/2)[2*7 + (25-1)*0.25].\n\nCompute inside the brackets: 14 + 24*0.25. 24 *0.25 is 6. So 14+6=20.\n\nSo sum is 25/2 *20 = (25)(10)=250.
