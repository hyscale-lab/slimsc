      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out how many files on Sam's hard drive aren't infected by a worm. Hmm, let's see. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says that all 250 files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. So that means every file has at least one of the two infections. No file is completely clean. Got it.\n\nThe next part says that the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. Oh, okay, so let's denote some variables here. Let me think. Let's let B be the number of files infected by both. Then, the files only infected by the worm would be 2.5 times B, right? So that's 2.5B.\n\nWait, but how about the files infected only by the virus? I don't have a direct ratio for that yet. Hmm.\n\nThe problem also states that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. So 50% of 250 is 125 files. Oh wait, no, wait. If 50% were not infected by a virus, that means 50% are infected by the virus. Because all files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 50% were NOT infected by a virus. So 50% of 250 is 125. So 125 files are not infected by a virus. Which means those 125 are only infected by a worm, right? Because if they aren't infected by a virus, their only infection must be the worm.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Because some files could be infected by both. So the 125 that aren't infected by a virus are only infected by the worm. Because if they were infected by both, they would be part of the virus-infected group. So the files not infected by a virus are the ones only with the worm.\n\nSo the number of files only with the worm is 125. Hmm, but earlier I thought that the number of files only with the worm is 2.5 times the number of files with both. So 2.5B equals 125?\n\nLet me write that down.\n\nOnly worm = 2.5 * Both.\n\nBut Only worm is also equal to 125 because 50% of 250 is 125, and those are the ones not infected by the virus.\n\nSo 2.5B = 125.\n\nHmm, solving for B: B = 125 / 2.5 = 50. So the number of files infected by both is 50.\n\nNow, what about the files infected only by the virus? Let me think. The total number of files is 250. The files are divided into three categories:\n\n1. Only virus (V)\n2. Only worm (W)\n3. Both (B)\n\nSo the total is V + W + B = 250.\n\nWe know W is 125, B is 50. So V + 125 + 50 = 250 \u2192 V = 250 - 175 = 75.\n\nSo the number of files only with the virus is 75.\n\nBut the question is asking how many files were NOT infected by a worm. So those would be the files only infected by the virus, right? Because if a file isn't infected by a worm, it's only got the virus.\n\nSo the number is 75. Let me check the options. The options are A)50, B)70, C)75, D)100, E)125. So the answer should be C)75.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nSo:\n\nTotal files: 250.\n\n50% not infected by virus \u2192 125 files. These are only worm. So W =125.\n\nW = 2.5B \u2192 125 =2.5B \u2192 B=50.\n\nSo files with both:50.\n\nOnly virus: V = 250 - (W + B) = 250 - (125 +50) =75.\n\nSo files not infected by worm are only virus \u219275.\n\nSo the answer is C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about Sam's hard drive with 250 files, all of which are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. I need to find out how many files were not infected by a worm. Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let's list the given information. The total number of files is 250. All of them are infected by either a virus (V), a worm (W), or both. So, there's no file that's completely clean. \n\nThe problem says the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both. Let me write that down. Let me denote the number of files infected by both as B. So, the number of files only with a worm would be 2.5 * B. \n\nWait, but wait. So, the files can be categorized into three groups: only virus (V), only worm (W), and both (B). Because all files are infected by at least one, the total is V + W + B = 250. But wait, no, because V is only virus, W is only worm, and B is both. So V + W + B = 250. Correct.\n\nNext, the problem states that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Wait, if 50% were not infected by a virus, that means 50% are infected by a worm only or both. Because if a file isn't infected by a virus, it must be only worm or both. Let me think.\n\nWait, 50% of 250 is 125. So, 125 files are not infected by a virus. That means these 125 are either only worm or both worm and virus. So, W + B = 125. Because those are the files without a virus. \n\nWait, but earlier I had W (only worm) as 2.5 times B (both). So, W = 2.5 B. So substituting into W + B =125, we get 2.5 B + B =125 \u2192 3.5 B =125. Let me calculate B.\n\n3.5 B = 125 \u2192 B = 125 / 3.5. Hmm, 3.5 is 7/2, so 125 * 2/7 = 250/7 \u2248 35.714. Wait, but can B be a fraction? Well, in the context of files, the numbers should be whole, but maybe the problem allows it? Or perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, 3.5 is 7/2, so 125 divided by 3.5 is the same as 125 * 2/7 = 250/7, which is approximately 35.714. Hmm, but the number of files should be an integer. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this using set theory. Let me think again.\n\nTotal files = 250.\n\nLet V be the number of files with virus, W be the number with worm. So, the number with both is V \u2229 W, which is B.\n\nWe know that the number of files with only worm is W - B, and only virus is V - B. \n\nGiven that 50% are not infected by virus. So, the number of files not infected by virus is 125. These are the files that are only worm or both worm and virus. So, (W - B) + B = W = 125. Wait, wait, no. Because W is the total number of files with worm, which includes those with only worm and those with both. So, the number of files not infected by virus is W, because if they don't have virus, they must have worm. So, W = 125.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So W =125. That's the total number of files with worm, including those with both. So, the number of files only with worm is W_only = W - B.\n\nWait, but the problem says the number of files infected only by worm is 2.5 times the number infected by both. So, W_only = 2.5 * B. But W_only is W - B, so:\n\nW - B = 2.5 B \u2192 W = 3.5 B.\n\nSince W is 125, substituting:\n\n125 = 3.5 B \u2192 B = 125 / 3.5 \u2192 35.714. Hmm, same result as before. Still a fraction. But this can't be right because B must be an integer. So, perhaps I made a wrong assumption.\n\nWait, maybe the 50% not infected by virus refers to the files that are neither. But wait, the problem says all 250 are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. So, no files are clean. So, the 50% not infected by virus must be the ones infected only by worm. Because if a file isn't infected by a virus, it must have a worm. So, the number of files not infected by virus is equal to the number of files infected only by worm plus those infected by both. Because if a file has both, it's still not not having a virus? Wait, no, because if a file has a virus, it's counted as infected by virus. So, the files not infected by virus are those that have only worm or both. But wait, no, because if a file has both, it's infected by a virus. So, the files not infected by virus are only those that have only worm. Because if a file has a worm and a virus, it is infected by a virus, so it wouldn't be in the group not infected by virus. \n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. If a file is infected by both, it's considered to have a virus. So, the group of files not infected by a virus would only be those that have worm but no virus. So, the number is only W_only. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem says 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. So, 125 files are not infected by virus. So, these 125 have only worm, because if they had both, they would have a virus. So, W_only =125. \n\nBut the problem states that the number of files only with worm is 2.5 times the number of files with both. So, W_only = 2.5 * B. \n\nIf W_only is 125, then 125 = 2.5 * B \u2192 B = 125 / 2.5 = 50. \n\nSo, B is 50. \n\nThen, the total number of files with worm is W = W_only + B = 125 +50=175. \n\nWait, but that can't be right because the total files are 250. Because the number of files infected by a virus would be V = V_only + B. \n\nWait, V is the total number of files with virus, which includes those with only virus and those with both. So, V = V_only + B. \n\nWe know that all files are infected by either virus or worm or both. So, the total is V + W_only = 250? No, because some are in both. Wait, the total is V + W - B = 250. Because V includes B, and W includes B, so when you add V and W, you've counted B twice, so you subtract it once to get the correct total.\n\nSo, V + W - B = 250.\n\nWe have V = V_only + B. So, V = (V_only) + B.\n\nBut V_only is the number of files infected only by virus. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, since the total is 250, and all are infected by at least one, the union of V and W is 250.\n\nSo, V \u222a W = 250. \n\nThe formula is |V \u222a W| = |V| + |W| - |V \u2229 W|.\n\nSo, 250 = |V| + |W| - B.\n\nBut we know |W| = W_only + B =125 +50=175.\n\nWait, earlier I thought W_only is 125, but according to the problem, W_only is 2.5 * B. So, if B is 50, then W_only is 125. Which matches. So, W is 175.\n\nSo, 250 = |V| + 175 -50 \u2192 250 = |V| + 125 \u2192 |V| = 125.\n\nSo, |V|=125, which is the number of files infected by virus, including those with both.\n\nSo, V = 125. Which means the number of files only infected by virus is V_only = V - B =125 -50=75.\n\nNow, the question is asking how many files were NOT infected by a worm. \n\nSo, the files not infected by a worm are those that are only virus. Because if a file is not infected by a worm, it must have only virus. Because all files are infected by either virus or worm or both. So, the number is V_only, which is 75.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nTotal files:250.\n\nOnly virus:75.\n\nOnly worm:125.\n\nBoth:50.\n\nAdding 75+125+50=250. Correct.\n\nSo, the number not infected by a worm is only virus, which is 75.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 75.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by categorizing the files based on their infection status:\n\n1. **Total files**: 250. All files are infected by either a virus (V), a worm (W), or both.\n2. **Files not infected by a virus**: 50% of 250 = 125. These files are either only infected by a worm (W_only) or both (B). Thus, W_only + B = 125.\n3. **Relationship between W_only and B**: The problem states that the number of files only infected by a worm (W_only) is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both (B). Therefore, W_only = 2.5B.\n4. **Substitute W_only in the equation W_only + B = 125**:  \n   \\[\n   2.5B + B = 125 \\implies 3.5B = 125 \\implies B = \\frac{125}{3.5} = 35.714\n   \\]  \n   Since the number of files must be an integer, this suggests a potential inconsistency in the problem setup or assumptions. However, we proceed with the given relationships.\n\n5. **Total files infected by a worm (W)**:  \n   \\[\n   W = \\text{W_only} + B = 2.5B + B = 3.5B\n   \\]  \n   Substituting \\( B = 35.714 \\):  \n   \\[\n   W = 3.5 \\times 35.714 \\approx 125\n   \\]  \n   Thus, W = 125.\n\n6. **Total files infected by a virus (V)**: Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:  \n   \\[\n   |V \\cup W| = |V| + |W| - |V \\cap W|\n   \\]  \n   Since all 250 files are infected by at least one, \\( |V \\cup W| = 250 \\). Substituting \\( |W| = 125 \\) and \\( |V \\cap W| = B = 35.714 \\):  \n   \\[\n   250 = |V| + 125 - 35.714 \\implies |V| = 250 - 125 + 35.714 = 160.286\n   \\]  \n   Thus, \\( |V| \\approx 160.286 \\).\n\n7. **Files only infected by a virus (V_only)**:  \n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{only}} = |V| - B = 160.286 - 35.714 = 124.572\n   \\]  \n   Since the number of files must be an integer, we approximate \\( V_{\\text{only}} \\approx 125 \\).\n\n8. **Files not infected by a worm**: These are the files only infected by a virus (\\( V_{\\text{only}} \\)). From the calculations, \\( V_{\\text{only}} \\approx 125 \\).\n\nThus, the number of files not infected by a worm is approximately **125**.\n\nAnswer: E",

But W_only is W - B, so:\n\nW - B = 2.5 B \u2192 W = 3.5 B.\n\nSince W is 125, substituting:\n\n125 = 3.5 B \u2192 B = 125 / 3.5 \u2192 35.714. Hmm, same result as before. Still a fraction. But this can't be right because B must be an integer. So, perhaps I made a wrong assumption.\n\nWait, maybe the 50% not infected by virus refers to the files that are neither. But wait, the problem says all 250 are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. So, no files are clean. So, the 50% not infected by virus must be the ones infected only by worm. Because if a file isn't infected by a virus, it must have a worm. So, the number of files not infected by virus is equal to the number of files infected only by worm plus those infected by both. Because if a file has both, it's still not not having a virus? Wait, no, because if a file has a virus, it's counted as infected by virus. So, the files not infected by virus are those that have only worm or both. But wait, no, because if a file has both, it's infected by a virus. So, the files not infected by virus are only those that have only worm. Because if a file has a worm and a virus, it is infected by a virus, so it wouldn't be in the group not infected by virus. \n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. If a file is infected by both, it's considered to have a virus. So, the group of files not infected by a virus would only be those that have worm but no virus. So, the number is only W_only. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem says 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. So, 125 files are not infected by virus. So, these 125 have only worm, because if they had both, they would have a virus. So, W_only =125. \n\nBut the problem states that the number of files only with worm is 2.5 times the number of files with both. So, W_only = 2.5 * B. \n\nIf W_only is 125, then 125 = 2.5 * B \u2192 B = 125 / 2.5 = 50. \n\nSo, B is 50. \n\nThen, the total number of files with worm is W = W_only + B = 125 +50=175. \n\nWait, but that can't be right because the total files are 250. Because the number of files infected by a virus would be V = V_only + B. \n\nWait, V is the total number of files with virus, which includes those with only virus and those with both. So, V = V_only + B. \n\nWe know that all files are infected by either virus or worm or both. So, the total is V + W_only = 250? No, because some are in both. Wait, the total is V + W - B = 250. Because V includes B, and W includes B, so when you add V and W, you've counted B twice, so you subtract it once to get the correct total.\n\nSo, V + W - B = 250.\n\nWe have V = V_only + B. So, V = (V_only) + B.\n\nBut V_only is the number of files infected only by virus. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, since the total is 250, and all are infected by at least one, the union of V and W is 250.\n\nSo, V \u222a W = 250. \n\nThe formula is |V \u222a W| = |V| + |W| - |V \u2229 W|.\n\nSo, 250 = |V| + |W| - B.\n\nBut we know |W| = W_only + B =125 +50=175.\n\nWait, earlier I thought W_only is 125, but according to the problem, W_only is 2.5 * B. So, if B is 50, then W_only is 125. Which matches. So, W is 175.\n\nSo, 250 = |V| + 175 -50 \u2192 250 = |V| + 125 \u2192 |V| = 125.\n\nSo, |V|=125, which is the number of files infected by virus, including those with both.\n\nSo, V = 125. Which means the number of files only infected by virus is V_only = V - B =125 -50=75.\n\nNow, the question is asking how many files were NOT infected by a worm. \n\nSo, the files not infected by a worm are those that are only virus. Because if a file is not infected by a worm, it must have only virus. Because all files are infected by either virus or worm or both. So, the number is V_only, which is 75.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nTotal files:250.\n\nOnly virus:75.\n\nOnly worm:125.\n\nBoth:50.\n\nAdding 75+125+50=250. Correct.\n\nSo, the number not infected by a worm is only virus, which is 75.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 75.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by categorizing the files based on their infection status:\n\n1. **Total files**: 250. All files are infected by either a virus (V), a worm (W), or both.\n2. **Files not infected by a virus**: 50% of 250 = 125. These files are either only infected by a worm (W_only) or both (B). Thus, W_only + B = 125.\n3. **Relationship between W_only and B**: The problem states that the number of files only infected by a worm (W_only) is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both (B). Therefore, W_only = 2.5B.\n4. **Substitute W_only in the equation W_only + B = 125**:  \n   \\[\n   2.5B + B = 125 \\implies 3.5B = 125 \\implies B = \\frac{125}{3.5} = 35.714\n   \\]  \n   Since the number of files must be an integer, this suggests a potential inconsistency in the problem setup or assumptions. However, we proceed with the given relationships.\n\n5. **Total files infected by a worm (W)**:  \n   \\[\n   W = \\text{W_only} + B = 2.5B + B = 3.5B\n   \\]  \n   Substituting \\( B = 35.714 \\):  \n   \\[\n   W = 3.5 \\times 35.714 \\approx 125\n   \\]  \n   Thus, W = 125.\n\n6. **Total files infected by a virus (V)**: Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:  \n   \\[\n   |V \\cup W| = |V| + |W| - |V \\cap W|\n   \\]  \n   Since all 250 files are infected by at least one, \\( |V \\cup W| = 250 \\). Substituting \\( |W| = 125 \\) and \\( |V \\cap W| = B = 35.714 \\):  \n   \\[\n   250 = |V| + 125 - 35.714 \\implies |V| = 250 - 125 + 35.714 = 160.286\n   \\]  \n   Thus, \\( |V| \\approx 160.286 \\).\n\n7. **Files only infected by a virus (V_only)**:  \n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{only}} = |V| - B = 160.286 - 35.714 = 124.572\n   \\]  \n   Since the number of files must be an integer, we approximate \\( V_{\\text{only}} \\approx 125 \\).\n\n8. **Files not infected by a worm**: These are the files only infected by a virus (\\( V_{\\text{only}} \\)). From the calculations, \\( V_{\\text{only}} \\approx 125 \\).\n\nThus, the number of files not infected by a worm is approximately **125**.\n\nAnswer: E",

So V = 125.\n\nNow, we have V = 125.\n\nFrom the earlier equation, V = 125, and W = 3.5B.\n\nWe also know that the total number of files is V + W - B = 250.\n\nSubstituting V and W into the equation:\n\n125 + 3.5B - B = 250.\n\nWait, that simplifies to 125 + 2.5B = 250.\n\nSubtract 125 from both sides: 2.5B = 125.\n\nSo B = 125 / 2.5 = 50.\n\nWait, 2.5 times 50 is 125. Yeah, correct.\n\nSo B is 50.\n\nThen, W = 3.5B = 3.5 * 50 = 175.\n\nSo W is 175.\n\nNow, the question is asking how many files were NOT infected by a worm.\n\nWait, the files not infected by a worm would be the files only infected by virus plus the uninfected files. But wait, the problem states that all 250 files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. So there are no files uninfected by both. So the files not infected by a worm are those that are infected only by virus.\n\nSo, number of files not infected by worm is V_only = V - B = 125 - 50 = 75.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check. Because if all files are either virus, worm, or both, then the files not infected by worm are those infected only by virus. So, yes, 75.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 75.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by defining the variables:\n\n- Let \\( V \\) be the number of files infected by a virus.\n- Let \\( W \\) be the number of files infected by a worm.\n- Let \\( B \\) be the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.\n- Let \\( W_{\\text{only}} \\) be the number of files infected only by a worm.\n\nFrom the problem, we know the following:\n\n1. The total number of files is 250, and all files are infected by either a virus, a worm, or both. This gives the equation:\n   \\[\n   V + W - B = 250\n   \\]\n\n2. The number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm:\n   \\[\n   W_{\\text{only}} = 2.5B\n   \\]\n   Since \\( W_{\\text{only}} = W - B \\), substituting gives:\n   \\[\n   W - B = 2.5B \\implies W = 3.5B\n   \\]\n\n3. The problem states that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. This means 50% of the files were infected by a virus:\n   \\[\n   V = 0.5 \\times 250 = 125\n   \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( V = 125 \\) and \\( W = 3.5B \\) into the total equation:\n\\[\n125 + 3.5B - B = 250\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\\[\n125 + 2.5B = 250\n\\]\nSubtract 125 from both sides:\n\\[\n2.5B = 125\n\\]\nSolve for \\( B \\):\n\\[\nB = \\frac{125}{2.5} = 50\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate \\( W \\):\n\\[\nW = 3.5B = 3.5 \\times 50 = 175\n\\]\n\nThe number of files not infected by a worm is the number of files infected only by a virus:\n\\[\nV_{\\text{only}} = V - B = 125 - 50 = 75\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of files not infected by a worm is **75**.\n\nAnswer: C",

So, 50% of 250 is 125 files not infected by a virus. That means those 125 files are only infected by a worm, right? Because if a file isn't infected by a virus, it must be infected by a worm (since all files are infected by at least one). So, W_only = 125.\n\nWait, wait a minute.

Since all files are infected by at least one, these are the files infected only by a virus. So, that's V_only = V - B.\n\nWait, but we can also think about the number of files not infected by a virus. That's 125, which are only worm-infected. So, the number of files not infected by a worm would be the number of files not in W.

So, V + 175 -50 = 250 \u2192 V + 125 = 250 \u2192 V=125. So, the number of files infected by a virus is 125. But how many of these are only virus? That's V_only = V - B = 125 -50=75.\n\nSo, the number of files not infected by a worm is 75. Let me check the options. Option C is 75.\n\nWait, but let me verify all steps again.\n\n1.

Only worm is 125, which makes sense because 175 -50=125.\n\nNow, the question is asking how many files were NOT infected by a worm.\n\nWait, not infected by a worm means they are in the group that has only virus or neither. But wait, all files are infected by at least one. So, files not infected by a worm must be those infected only by the virus.\n\nBecause if a file isn't infected by a worm, it must be infected by a virus (since all are infected by at least one). So the number is the only virus files.\n\nOnly virus files are V - B = 125 - 50 =75.\n\nSo 75 files are not infected by a worm.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 75. So the answer should be C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use set theory and the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let:\n\n- \\( B \\) = number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.\n- \\( W \\) = total number of files infected by a worm.\n- \\( V \\) = total number of files infected by a virus.\n\n### Key Information:\n1. All 250 files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. Thus, the total number of files is 250.\n2. The number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both. This gives:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Only worm} = 2.5B \\quad \\text{and} \\quad W - B = 2.5B \\implies W = 3.5B.\n   \\]\n3. 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. Since there are 250 files, the number of files not infected by a virus is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{50}{100} \\times 250 = 125.\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the number of files infected by a virus is:\n   \\[\n   V = 250 - 125 = 125.\n   \\]\n\n### Applying Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:\nThe total number of files is given by:\n\\[\nV + W - B = 250.\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( V = 125 \\) and \\( W = 3.5B \\):\n\\[\n125 + 3.5B - B = 250.\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\\[\n125 + 2.5B = 250.\n\\]\nSubtract 125 from both sides:\n\\[\n2.5B = 125.\n\\]\nSolve for \\( B \\):\n\\[\nB = \\frac{125}{2.5} = 50.\n\\]\n\n### Calculating the Number of Files Not Infected by a Worm:\nFiles not infected by a worm are those infected only by a virus. The number of files infected only by a virus is:\n\\[\nV - B = 125 - 50 = 75.\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of files not infected by a worm is **75**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Sam's files being infected by viruses or worms or both. Hmm, I need to figure out how many files weren't infected by a worm. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll note the given information. There are 250 files in total. All of them are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. So, no files are uninfected by both. That's important.\n\nThe problem says the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. Let me write that as an equation. Let's denote the number of files infected by both as B. So, the files only infected by a worm would be 2.5 * B.\n\nNext, the problem states that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. So, half of 250 is 125 files. These are the files that don't have a virus. But wait, since all files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both, these 125 files must be infected only by a worm. Because if they weren't infected by a virus, they must have been infected by a worm, right?\n\nWait, no, wait. Because some files could be infected by both. Hmm. Wait, no. Because if a file is not infected by a virus, it can't be in the both category. Because the both category would mean it has both, which implies it has a virus. So, the 125 files not infected by a virus must be only infected by worms. So, the number of files only worm-infected is 125.\n\nBut earlier, the problem says that the number of files only worm-infected is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both. So, 125 = 2.5 * B. Let me solve for B.\n\nDividing both sides by 2.5: B = 125 / 2.5. Let me calculate that. 2.5 times 50 is 125, so B is 50. So, 50 files are infected by both.\n\nNow, I need to find how many files were NOT infected by a worm. Wait, no. The question is, how many files were NOT infected by a worm. So, these would be files that are only infected by a virus.\n\nBecause all files are either virus-only, worm-only, or both. So, the files not infected by a worm are those only with a virus.\n\nSo, total files = virus-only + worm-only + both.\n\nWait, no. Because the way it's usually calculated, the total is (virus only) + (worm only) + (both) = total. But wait, no, that's not correct. Because the standard formula is:\n\nTotal = virus + worm - both.\n\nBut in this case, since all files are infected by at least one, the total is virus + worm - both = 250.\n\nWait, but let's get back. I have the number of worm-only files as 125, both as 50. So, how many are virus-only?\n\nWait, another approach. Let's denote:\n\n- V = number of files infected by virus (could be only virus or both)\n- W = number of files infected by worm (could be only worm or both)\n- B = both =50.\n\nBut the problem says 50% (125 files) are not infected by a virus. So, that implies that the number of files infected by a virus is 250 - 125 = 125. Because 125 are not, so 125 are. So, V = 125.\n\nBut V includes both files infected only by virus and those infected by both. So, V = virus-only + B.\n\nWe know V is 125, and B is 50. So, virus-only = V - B = 125 -50=75.\n\nSo, the number of files only infected by virus is 75.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking how many files were NOT infected by a worm. So, files not infected by a worm are those that are only virus. Because worm infection includes both worm-only and both.\n\nSo, the number of files not infected by worm is 75.

All files are infected by at least one, so the total is 250. The problem mentions two types of infections: virus (V) and worm (W). Some files might have both.\n\nThe first piece of information is that the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both. Let me note that down.

But wait, the problem says all files are infected, so those 125 must be only worm-infected. Because if they weren't infected by a virus, but all files are infected, they must be by worm only. So, the only worm-infected files are 125?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The 50% not infected by virus means that 50% are infected by virus. So, 125 are not infected by virus, meaning they are either only worm or neither. But since all 250 are infected by either or both, the 125 must be only worm. So, the number of files only with worm is 125.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the only worm-infected is 2.5B. So, 2.5B = 125? Let me see. So, solving for B, 2.5B = 125 \u2192 B = 125 / 2.5 = 50. So, B is 50. That means 50 files are infected by both virus and worm.\n\nNow, I need to find how many files are not infected by a worm. That would be the number of files not having worm at all. Since all files are infected by either virus or worm or both, the files not infected by worm are those that are only virus-infected.\n\nLet me think about the total. The total number of files is 250. Let's break it down:\n\n- Only virus: V\n- Only worm: W\n- Both: B =50\n- Neither: 0 (since all are infected)\n\nSo, V + W + B =250. But wait, V is only virus, W is only worm. So, V = total virus-infected minus both. Hmm, but perhaps another approach.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of virus-infected files is (V + B). The total number of worm-infected is (W + B). We know W is 125, from earlier? Wait, no, because earlier I thought that the 125 not infected by virus are the only worm-infected. So W is 125, B is 50.\n\nSo, the number of virus-infected is V + B. But how much is V? Let's see. The total is V + W + B =250. Since W is 125, and B is 50, then V + 125 +50 =250 \u2192 V = 75. So, V is 75. That's the number of files only infected by virus.\n\nSo, the number of files not infected by worm is V, which is 75. Because worm is only present in W and B. So, the only files without worm are those with only virus, which is 75.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The files not infected by worm would be those that have neither worm nor both. Since all files are infected, they can't have neither. So, only files with only virus would not have worm. So, that's 75.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 75. So the answer should be C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about Sam's hard drive with 250 files, all infected by either a virus or a worm or both. I need to find how many files were not infected by a worm. Hmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the given information. All files are infected by at least one, so the total is 250. The problem mentions two types of infections: virus (V) and worm (W). Some files might have both.\n\nThe first piece of information is that the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both. Let me note that down. So, if I let the number of files infected by both be B, then the number of files only by worm is 2.5B.\n\nNext, the problem states that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. Wait, 50% of 250 is 125. So, 125 files are not infected by a virus. That means these 125 files are only infected by a worm or neither. But wait, the problem says all files are infected, so those 125 must be only worm-infected. Because if they weren't infected by a virus, but all files are infected, they must be by worm only. So, the only worm-infected files are 125?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The 50% not infected by virus means that 50% are infected by virus. So, 125 are not infected by virus, meaning they are either only worm or neither. But since all 250 are infected by either or both, the 125 must be only worm. So, the number of files only with worm is 125.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the only worm-infected is 2.5B. So, 2.5B = 125? Let me see. So, solving for B, 2.5B = 125 \u2192 B = 125 / 2.5 = 50. So, B is 50. That means 50 files are infected by both virus and worm.\n\nNow, I need to find how many files are not infected by a worm. That would be the number of files not having worm at all. Since all files are infected by either virus or worm or both, the files not infected by worm are those that are only virus-infected.\n\nLet me think about the total. The total number of files is 250. Let's break it down:\n\n- Only virus: V\n- Only worm: W\n- Both: B =50\n- Neither: 0 (since all are infected)\n\nSo, V + W + B =250. But wait, V is only virus, W is only worm. So, V = total virus-infected minus both. Hmm, but perhaps another approach.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of virus-infected files is (V + B). The total number of worm-infected is (W + B). We know W is 125, from earlier? Wait, no, because earlier I thought that the 125 not infected by virus are the only worm-infected. So W is 125, B is 50.\n\nSo, the number of virus-infected is V + B. But how much is V? Let's see. The total is V + W + B =250. Since W is 125, and B is 50, then V + 125 +50 =250 \u2192 V = 75. So, V is 75. That's the number of files only infected by virus.\n\nSo, the number of files not infected by worm is V, which is 75. Because worm is only present in W and B. So, the only files without worm are those with only virus, which is 75.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The files not infected by worm would be those that have neither worm nor both. Since all files are infected, they can't have neither. So, only files with only virus would not have worm. So, that's 75.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 75. So the answer should be C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let's break down the given information and use set theory to find the number of files not infected by a worm.\n\n1. **Total files**: 250, all infected by either a virus (V), a worm (W), or both.\n\n2. **Files not infected by a virus**: 50% of 250 = 125. Since all files are infected, these 125 files must be infected only by a worm.\n\n3. **Relationship between worm-only and both infections**: The number of files infected only by a worm (W) is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm (B). Thus, \\( W = 2.5B \\).\n\n4. **Substitute \\( W \\) into the total**: The total number of files can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   V + W + B = 250\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( V \\) is the number of files infected only by a virus, \\( W \\) is the number of files infected only by a worm, and \\( B \\) is the number of files infected by both.\n\n5. **Substitute \\( W = 125 \\) and solve for \\( B \\)**:\n   \\[\n   V + 125 + B = 250\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   V + B = 125\n   \\]\n\n6. **Use the relationship \\( W = 2.5B \\)**:\n   \\[\n   125 = 2.5B\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   B = \\frac{125}{2.5} = 50\n   \\]\n\n7. **Find \\( V \\)**:\n   From \\( V + B = 125 \\), substitute \\( B = 50 \\):\n   \\[\n   V + 50 = 125\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   V = 75\n   \\]\n\n8. **Determine the number of files not infected by a worm**: Files not infected by a worm are those infected only by a virus, which is \\( V = 75 \\).\n\nThus, the number of files not infected by a worm is **75**.\n\nAnswer: C",

That means there are no files outside of these two categories. The total number is 250, so the union of virus and worm infections is 250.\n\nThe problem says the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number infected by both. Let's denote the number of files infected by both as B. Then, the number infected only by a worm would be 2.5B.\n\nI think I need to set up some equations here. Let's define:\n- V as the number of files infected by a virus (including those also infected by a worm).\n- W as the number of files infected by a worm (including those also infected by a virus).\n- B as the number of files infected by both.\n- V_only as the number infected only by virus, so V_only = V - B.\n- W_only as the number infected only by worm, which is given as 2.5B.\n\nWait, the problem also says that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. Since there are 250 files, 50% of them is 125 files not infected by a virus. So, the number of files not infected by a virus is 125. That means the number of files infected by a virus (V) is the total minus this, so V = 250 - 125 = 125. So, V = 125.\n\nBut wait, V includes both the virus-only and the both cases. So, V = V_only + B. But V_only is V - B, as I thought before.\n\nNow, the total number of files is the sum of V_only, W_only, and B. Wait no, because the union is V + W - B. But since all files are infected by at least one, the union is 250. So, V + W - B = 250.\n\nAlternatively, since V = V_only + B and W = W_only + B, and the total is V_only + W_only + B = 250? Wait, no, because V_only + W_only + B = (V - B) + (W - B) + B = V + W - B. So yes, that's 250.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to approach it with the given information.\n\nWe know that W_only = 2.5B.

V = 125 (since 50% are not infected by virus, so 50% are, which is 125)\n2. W = W_only + B\n3. W_only = 2.5B\n4. Total infected = V + W - B = 250\n\nSo substituting equation 3 into equation 2, W = 2.5B + B = 3.5B.\n\nNow, equation 4 becomes:\n\nV + W - B = 250 \u2192 125 + 3.5B - B = 250 \u2192 125 + 2.5B = 250.\n\nSubtract 125 from both sides: 2.5B = 125 \u2192 B = 125 / 2.5 \u2192 B = 50.\n\nSo B is 50. Then W_only is 2.5 * 50 = 125.\n\nNow, the question asks how many files were NOT infected by a worm. So the number not infected by a worm is the total minus the number infected by a worm.\n\nThe number infected by a worm is W, which is 3.5B = 3.5*50 = 175.\n\nSo files not infected by worm = 250 - 175 = 75.\n\nWait, but wait another way: the number not infected by a worm would be the number not in W. Since all files are either virus, worm, or both. So the complement of W is the files that are only virus. Because W includes both the worm-only and both cases.\n\nWait, no. The files not infected by a worm would be those that are only virus. Because if a file is not infected by a worm, it can't have the worm. So, only the virus-only files.

Hmm, okay, let's see. \n\nThe problem says all 250 files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. So that means every file has at least one of them, no files are uninfected by both. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question at the end is about files not infected by a worm. So maybe I should think in terms of sets.\n\nLet me try to outline what's given. \n\nTotal files: 250.\n\nAll files are infected by either virus (V) or worm (W) or both. So the union of V and W is 250. \n\nThe number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number infected by both. So, if I let the number of both be x, then the only worm is 2.5x.\n\nAlso, 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. Wait, 50% not infected by a virus means 50% are infected by a virus.

So 125 files are not infected by V. Which means these 125 are only W or both? No, wait, no. Wait, no, because all files are infected by either V or W or both. So if a file isn't infected by V, it must be infected by W. Because all files are in V \u222a W.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the 125 files not infected by V are all in W. So the number of files only W plus the number of files in both is 125.\n\nWait, so the number of files only in W is 2.5x, and the number of files in both is x. So 2.5x + x = 125. That would give 3.5x = 125. So x would be 125 / 3.5. Let me calculate that. 125 divided by 3.5. Hmm, 3.5 is 7/2, so 125 * 2/7 is 250/7, which is approximately 35.714. Wait, but x has to be an integer because you can't have a fraction of a file. Hmm, maybe the numbers are such that it works out. Let me check 35.714. 3.5 * 35.714 is 125, yeah. So x is 35.714, but that's awkward. Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this using set formulas. Let's think in terms of V and W.\n\nWe know that:\n\nTotal (V \u222a W) = 250.\n\nNumber of files only in W = 2.5 * (both). Let me denote:\n\nLet both = x.\n\nOnly W = 2.5x.\n\nThen, the number of files only in V would be V_only.\n\nSo, the total is:\n\nV_only + W_only + both = 250.\n\nSo V_only + 2.5x + x = 250 \u2192 V_only + 3.5x = 250.\n\nAlso, the number of files not infected by V is 125. Those are the files in W only and both. So:\n\nW_only + both = 125 \u2192 2.5x + x = 125 \u2192 3.5x = 125 \u2192 x = 125 / 3.5.\n\nWait, same as before. So x is 125 / 3.5. Let me compute that: 125 divided by 3.5 is equal to (125 * 2) / 7 = 250/7 \u224835.714. But that's a fractional number. Hmm, perhaps I should keep it as a fraction for now.\n\nSo x = 250/7 \u224835.714.\n\nNow, V_only is 250 - 3.5x.\n\nSo substituting x:\n\nV_only = 250 - 3.5*(250/7).\n\nWait, 3.5 is 7/2. So 3.5 * (250/7) = (7/2)*(250/7) = (250/2) = 125.\n\nSo V_only = 250 - 125 = 125.\n\nWait, so V_only is 125. That's the number of files only in V.\n\nBut wait, the total number of files in V (both only V and both) is V_only + both = 125 + x.\n\nSo total V is 125 + x.\n\nBut wait, 50% of the files are not infected by V. That means 50% are infected by V. Wait, no, 50% are not, so 50% are. So the number of files infected by V is 125.\n\nBecause 50% of 250 is 125.\n\nSo, V_only + both = 125.\n\nBut earlier, V_only is 125, and both is x.\n\nSo 125 + x = 125 \u2192 x = 0.\n\nWait, that can't be right. That would mean x is zero, which would mean no files are infected by both. But earlier, x was 250/7, which is about 35.714. So there's a contradiction here.\n\nHmm, so where did I go wrong?\n\nLet me try to re-express the problem.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nV = set of files infected by virus.\n\nW = set of files infected by worm.\n\nTotal files: V \u222a W =250.\n\nGiven:\n\nOnly W = 2.5 * Both.\n\nAlso, 50% of the files are not in V. So, the number not in V is 125.\n\nSo, the number in V is 250 - 125 = 125.\n\nBut the number in V is V_only + Both.\n\nSo, V_only + Both = 125.\n\nAlso, the number in W is W_only + Both.\n\nBut W_only is 2.5 * Both.\n\nSo, W_only = 2.5 Both \u2192 W_only = 2.5x (let x=Both).\n\nSo, W = 2.5x + x = 3.5x.\n\nBut the number in W is W = W_only + Both = 3.5x.\n\nBut the total number of files is V + W - Both = 250.\n\nWait, V is 125, W is 3.5x, and Both is x.\n\nSo, 125 + 3.5x - x = 250.\n\n125 + 2.5x =250 \u2192 2.5x=125 \u2192 x=50.\n\nAh! So x is 50. That makes sense. So Both is 50.\n\nThen, W_only is 2.5 *50=125.\n\nSo W is 125 (only W) +50 (both) =175.\n\nV is 125 (only V) +50 (both)=175.\n\nWait, but V is 125? Because V_only is 125 - Both is 50. Wait, no, no. Wait, V is V_only + Both =125.\n\nSo V_only = 125 - Both =125-50=75.\n\nAh, okay.\n\nSo, V_only is 75.\n\nSo, the number of files not infected by a worm would be the number of files not in W. Since W is 175, the number not in W is 250-175=75.\n\nWait, but wait. Because all files are in V or W or both, so the files not in W must be in V only.\n\nSo the number not in W is V_only=75.\n\nSo the answer is 75, which is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about Sam's files being infected by viruses or worms. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, okay, let's see. \n\nThe problem says all 250 files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. So that means every file has at least one of them, no files are uninfected by both. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question at the end is about files not infected by a worm. So maybe I should think in terms of sets.\n\nLet me try to outline what's given. \n\nTotal files: 250.\n\nAll files are infected by either virus (V) or worm (W) or both. So the union of V and W is 250. \n\nThe number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number infected by both. So, if I let the number of both be x, then the only worm is 2.5x.\n\nAlso, 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. Wait, 50% not infected by a virus means 50% are infected by a virus. Wait, no. Wait, 50% were not infected by a virus. So that means 50% are uninfected by V. So the number of files not infected by V is 50% of 250. \n\nWait, 250 files. 50% is 125. So 125 files are not infected by V. Which means these 125 are only W or both? No, wait, no. Wait, no, because all files are infected by either V or W or both. So if a file isn't infected by V, it must be infected by W. Because all files are in V \u222a W.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the 125 files not infected by V are all in W. So the number of files only W plus the number of files in both is 125.\n\nWait, so the number of files only in W is 2.5x, and the number of files in both is x. So 2.5x + x = 125. That would give 3.5x = 125. So x would be 125 / 3.5. Let me calculate that. 125 divided by 3.5. Hmm, 3.5 is 7/2, so 125 * 2/7 is 250/7, which is approximately 35.714. Wait, but x has to be an integer because you can't have a fraction of a file. Hmm, maybe the numbers are such that it works out. Let me check 35.714. 3.5 * 35.714 is 125, yeah. So x is 35.714, but that's awkward. Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this using set formulas. Let's think in terms of V and W.\n\nWe know that:\n\nTotal (V \u222a W) = 250.\n\nNumber of files only in W = 2.5 * (both). Let me denote:\n\nLet both = x.\n\nOnly W = 2.5x.\n\nThen, the number of files only in V would be V_only.\n\nSo, the total is:\n\nV_only + W_only + both = 250.\n\nSo V_only + 2.5x + x = 250 \u2192 V_only + 3.5x = 250.\n\nAlso, the number of files not infected by V is 125. Those are the files in W only and both. So:\n\nW_only + both = 125 \u2192 2.5x + x = 125 \u2192 3.5x = 125 \u2192 x = 125 / 3.5.\n\nWait, same as before. So x is 125 / 3.5. Let me compute that: 125 divided by 3.5 is equal to (125 * 2) / 7 = 250/7 \u224835.714. But that's a fractional number. Hmm, perhaps I should keep it as a fraction for now.\n\nSo x = 250/7 \u224835.714.\n\nNow, V_only is 250 - 3.5x.\n\nSo substituting x:\n\nV_only = 250 - 3.5*(250/7).\n\nWait, 3.5 is 7/2. So 3.5 * (250/7) = (7/2)*(250/7) = (250/2) = 125.\n\nSo V_only = 250 - 125 = 125.\n\nWait, so V_only is 125. That's the number of files only in V.\n\nBut wait, the total number of files in V (both only V and both) is V_only + both = 125 + x.\n\nSo total V is 125 + x.\n\nBut wait, 50% of the files are not infected by V. That means 50% are infected by V. Wait, no, 50% are not, so 50% are. So the number of files infected by V is 125.\n\nBecause 50% of 250 is 125.\n\nSo, V_only + both = 125.\n\nBut earlier, V_only is 125, and both is x.\n\nSo 125 + x = 125 \u2192 x = 0.\n\nWait, that can't be right.

So that means every file is at least infected by one of them. No files are uninfected, right?\n\nThe problem gives me a couple of relationships. First, the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. So let me think about how to represent that.\n\nLet me denote the number of files infected only by a worm as W. And the number of files infected by both virus and worm as B. So according to the problem, W = 2.5 * B.\n\nAnother piece of information is that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. Wait, not infected by a virus? So 50% of 250 is 125 files. Those 125 files are not infected by a virus. But since all files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both, those 125 must be infected only by a worm. Because if a file isn't infected by a virus, it must be infected by a worm.\n\nSo that means the number of files infected only by a worm is 125. Oh, wait, because all the files are either virus, worm, or both. So, if 50% are not virus, they must be only worm. So W = 125.\n\nWait, but earlier I had W = 2.5 * B. So substituting, 125 = 2.5 * B. Let me solve for B. So B = 125 / 2.5. Let me calculate that: 125 divided by 2.5 is 50. So B is 50.\n\nSo the number of files infected by both is 50.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the number of files NOT infected by a worm. Wait, but all files are infected by either virus or worm or both. So if a file is not infected by a worm, it must be infected only by a virus.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The files can be in three categories: only virus (V), only worm (W), and both (B). So all 250 are V + W + B.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no. Because if a file is in both, it's counted in both V and W. So the total is V + W + B? Or is it V_only + W_only + B? Because in the case of both, the file is infected by both, so it's part of both categories.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: the total number of files is the number of files infected by virus (V) plus the number infected by worm (W) minus those infected by both (B), because B is counted in both V and W. So the formula is V + W - B = 250.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, all files are infected by either virus or worm or both. So that's the same as the union of V and W is 250.\n\nBut I'm trying to find the number of files not infected by a worm. So those would be the files that are only infected by a virus. Because if a file is not infected by a worm, it can't be in the worm category at all. So it must be only virus.\n\nSo the number of files not infected by a worm is V_only. Which is equal to V minus B, since V includes both only virus and both.\n\nWait, no. Wait, V is the total number of files infected by virus (including those that are also worm). So V = V_only + B.\n\nSo V_only = V - B.\n\nBut how do I find V?\n\nI know that the number of files not infected by a virus is 125, which as we determined earlier is equal to W_only (125). So that's the 125 files only worm.\n\nWait, that's correct because if 50% (125) are not infected by virus, they must be worm-only.\n\nSo let me summarize the variables:\n\n- Total files = 250.\n- W_only = 125 (because 50% not virus, so only worm).\n- W_only = 2.5 * B \u2192 125 = 2.5 B \u2192 B = 50.\n- So B is 50.\n\nNow, the total number of worm-infected files is W = W_only + B = 125 +50=175.\n\nBut I need the number of files not infected by a worm. That's the number of files only virus.\n\nBecause if a file is not infected by a worm, it's only virus. So how many files are only virus?\n\nWell, the total number of files is 250. So the files are V_only + W_only + B. But wait, no, because V_only and W_only are exclusive. So the total is V_only + W_only + B? No, that's not correct because B is the overlap.\n\nWait, the correct way to calculate the total is V + W - B = 250.\n\nBecause V is all virus (V_only + B), W is all worm (W_only + B). So V + W counts B twice, so subtract B once to get the correct total.\n\nSo V + W - B = 250.\n\nWe know W is W_only + B = 125 +50=175. So W=175.\n\nSo V + 175 -50 =250 \u2192 V +125=250 \u2192 V=125.\n\nSo V is 125, which is the total number of files infected by virus (including both V_only and B).\n\nSo V_only = V - B = 125 -50=75.\n\nSo the number of files not infected by a worm is 75.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 75.\n",

Wait, but all files are infected by either virus or worm or both. So if a file is not infected by a worm, it must be infected only by a virus.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The files can be in three categories: only virus (V), only worm (W), and both (B). So all 250 are V + W + B.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no. Because if a file is in both, it's counted in both V and W. So the total is V + W + B? Or is it V_only + W_only + B? Because in the case of both, the file is infected by both, so it's part of both categories.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: the total number of files is the number of files infected by virus (V) plus the number infected by worm (W) minus those infected by both (B), because B is counted in both V and W. So the formula is V + W - B = 250.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, all files are infected by either virus or worm or both. So that's the same as the union of V and W is 250.\n\nBut I'm trying to find the number of files not infected by a worm. So those would be the files that are only infected by a virus. Because if a file is not infected by a worm, it can't be in the worm category at all. So it must be only virus.\n\nSo the number of files not infected by a worm is V_only. Which is equal to V minus B, since V includes both only virus and both.\n\nWait, no. Wait, V is the total number of files infected by virus (including those that are also worm). So V = V_only + B.\n\nSo V_only = V - B.\n\nBut how do I find V?\n\nI know that the number of files not infected by a virus is 125, which as we determined earlier is equal to W_only (125). So that's the 125 files only worm.\n\nWait, that's correct because if 50% (125) are not infected by virus, they must be worm-only.\n\nSo let me summarize the variables:\n\n- Total files = 250.\n- W_only = 125 (because 50% not virus, so only worm).\n- W_only = 2.5 * B \u2192 125 = 2.5 B \u2192 B = 50.\n- So B is 50.\n\nNow, the total number of worm-infected files is W = W_only + B = 125 +50=175.\n\nBut I need the number of files not infected by a worm. That's the number of files only virus.\n\nBecause if a file is not infected by a worm, it's only virus. So how many files are only virus?\n\nWell, the total number of files is 250. So the files are V_only + W_only + B. But wait, no, because V_only and W_only are exclusive. So the total is V_only + W_only + B? No, that's not correct because B is the overlap.\n\nWait, the correct way to calculate the total is V + W - B = 250.\n\nBecause V is all virus (V_only + B), W is all worm (W_only + B). So V + W counts B twice, so subtract B once to get the correct total.\n\nSo V + W - B = 250.\n\nWe know W is W_only + B = 125 +50=175. So W=175.\n\nSo V + 175 -50 =250 \u2192 V +125=250 \u2192 V=125.\n\nSo V is 125, which is the total number of files infected by virus (including both V_only and B).\n\nSo V_only = V - B = 125 -50=75.\n\nSo the number of files not infected by a worm is 75.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 75.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the given information and define the following variables:\n\n- Total files: 250.\n- Files infected only by a worm: \\( W_{\\text{only}} \\).\n- Files infected by both virus and worm: \\( B \\).\n- Files infected only by a virus: \\( V_{\\text{only}} \\).\n\n### Step 1: Interpret the relationships\n1. The number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both:\n   \\[\n   W_{\\text{only}} = 2.5 \\cdot B\n   \\]\n2. 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, meaning these files are infected only by a worm:\n   \\[\n   W_{\\text{only}} = 0.5 \\cdot 250 = 125\n   \\]\n3.

Hmm, I think I need to use some set theory here, maybe the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let me try to break it down.\n\nThe problem states a few things. First, all 250 files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. So that means there's no file that's uninfected by both. Then, it says the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both. Oh, right, so if I let the number of files infected by both be, say, B, then the number of files only infected by the worm would be 2.5B. \n\nWait, the question also mentions that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. So 50% of 250 is 125 files. Those 125 files aren't infected by the virus, which means they must be only infected by the worm or maybe both? Wait, no. Because if a file is infected by both, it's infected by the virus. So those 125 files can't be infected by the virus at all. So they must be only worm-infected. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the number of files only infected by the worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both. So if the only worm-infected files are 125, that should equal 2.5 times B. Let me write that down.\n\nLet me denote:\n- Let B be the number of files infected by both virus and worm.\n- Then, the number of files only infected by the worm is 2.5B.\n- The number of files only infected by the virus would be V, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nWait, the total files are 250, and all are infected by at least one. So the total is only virus + only worm + both = 250.\n\nBut I also know that the number of files not infected by the virus is 125. Since not infected by the virus means they can't be in the only virus group or the both group. So they must be only in the only worm group. So that means the only worm-infected files are 125. \n\nBut earlier, we said that only worm is 2.5B. So 2.5B = 125. Let me solve for B.\n\n2.5B = 125 \u2192 B = 125 / 2.5. Let's calculate that: 125 divided by 2.5. 2.5 times 50 is 125, so B is 50. \n\nSo B is 50. That means 50 files are infected by both virus and worm.\n\nNow, the number of files only infected by the worm is 2.5 * 50 = 125, which matches the earlier point because that's how we got B in the first place.\n\nNow, the next part is to find how many files were NOT infected by a worm. Wait, not infected by a worm would mean they're only in the virus group, right? Because if they were in both, they are infected by the worm.\n\nSo the number of files not infected by a worm is the number of files only infected by the virus. Let's call that V_only.\n\nThe total files are 250. So, V_only + W_only + Both = 250. Wait, no, V_only + W_only + Both = 250. But W_only is 125, Both is 50. So V_only = 250 - 125 -50 = 75. \n\nWait, 250 minus 125 is 125, minus 50 is 75. So V_only is 75. \n\nSo the number of files not infected by a worm is 75. Looking at the options, option C is 75.

Option C is 75.\n\nWait, but let me double-check everything because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nSo, let's recap:\n\n- Total files: 250.\n\n- V = 125 (since 50% are not infected by virus, so 50% are, which is 125).\n\n- W = 3.5 B.\n\n- From the total: 250 = V + W - B \u2192 250 = 125 + 3.5B - B \u2192 250 = 125 + 2.5 B \u2192 125=2.5B \u2192 B=50.\n\nSo W = 3.5 *50=175.\n\nFiles not infected by worm: 250 - W = 250-175=75.\n\nSo answer is 75, which is option C.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: the number of files not infected by a worm is the same as the number of files not in W. So, yes, 250 - W.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by defining the variables:\n- Let \\( V \\) be the number of files infected by a virus.\n- Let \\( W \\) be the number of files infected by a worm.\n- Let \\( B \\) be the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.\n\nFrom the problem:\n1. The number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. This gives the equation:\n   \\[\n   W - B = 2.5B \\implies W = 3.5B\n   \\]\n\n2. It is stated that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. Since there are 250 files in total, the number of files infected by a virus is:\n   \\[\n   V = 250 - 0.5 \\times 250 = 125\n   \\]\n\n3. The total number of files can also be expressed using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n   \\[\n   V + W - B = 250\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( V = 125 \\) and \\( W = 3.5B \\) into the equation:\n   \\[\n   125 + 3.5B - B = 250\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   125 + 2.5B = 250 \\implies 2.5B = 125 \\implies B = 50\n   \\]\n\n4. Using \\( W = 3.5B \\), we calculate:\n   \\[\n   W = 3.5 \\times 50 = 175\n   \\]\n\n5. The number of files not infected by a worm is:\n   \\[\n   250 - W = 250 - 175 = 75\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of files not infected by a worm is **75**, which corresponds to option **C**.\n\nAnswer: C",

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. Wait, that means half of 250 are not virus-infected. Let me calculate that. 250 * 0.5 is 125. So, 125 files are not infected by a virus. But wait, since all files are either virus or worm or both, these 125 must be infected only by a worm. Or maybe some are both? No, wait. Because if a file is not infected by a virus, it can't be both. Because if it's both, then it has the virus. Oh, right, so those 125 are only worm-infected.\n\nWait, the problem also says that the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number infected by both. Let me denote the number of files infected by both as B. So, the only worm files are 2.5 * B.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the 125 files are only worm. So 2.5 B = 125? Because the only worm files are 2.5 times the both. Let me write that down.\n\nSo, 2.5 B = 125. Let me solve for B. 125 divided by 2.5 is 50. So B is 50. So 50 files are infected by both virus and worm.\n\nWait, but if that's the case, then how many are only virus? Because the total number of virus-infected files would be those only virus plus those that are both. But wait, wait. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the total number of files is 250. All are infected by virus or worm or both. So, using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the total is (only virus) + (only worm) + (both) = 250.\n\nBut wait, the only virus would be total virus minus both. Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of sets.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- V: total virus-infected files (including those also with worm)\n- W: total worm-infected files (including those also with virus)\n- B: both virus and worm.\n\nSo, V = only virus + B\nW = only worm + B\nTotal files = V + W - B = 250.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. So, 50% of 250 is 125, which are not virus. That means these 125 are only worm-infected, because if they were both, they'd have the virus. So, only worm = 125.\n\nBut wait, the problem also says that the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both. So, only worm = 2.5 * B. So 125 = 2.5 * B. That gives B = 50.\n\nSo, B is 50. That means both virus and worm in 50 files.\n\nNow, the total worm-infected files, W, is only worm plus B. So W = 125 + 50 = 175.\n\nWait, but what about the total virus-infected files, V? Because the 50% not infected by virus is 125, so the virus-infected are 250 - 125 = 125. So V is 125.\n\nBut V is also equal to only virus plus B. So only virus = V - B = 125 -50 =75.\n\nSo, let me check: only virus is 75, only worm is 125, both is 50. Sum them up: 75 +125 +50 = 250. That adds up, so that's correct.\n\nThe question is asking how many files were NOT infected by a worm. So, those are files not in W. Since W is 175, the not W is 250 -175 =75.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no. Because all files are either virus or worm or both. So if a file is not infected by a worm, it can't have a worm. But since all files have either virus or worm or both, a file not infected by a worm must have the virus only. Because if it didn't have the worm, but it's in the set, it must have the virus.\n\nWait, but wait. If a file is not infected by a worm, it could have the virus only. Because being in the set, it's either virus or worm or both. So the number not infected by a worm is the number that have only virus.\n\nEarlier, I found that only virus is 75. So the answer is 75.

Then:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Only worm} = 2.5B\n   \\]\n   Substituting the value of only worm infections:\n   \\[\n   125 = 2.5B \\implies B = \\frac{125}{2.5} = 50\n   \\]\n\n4. **Number of files infected only by a virus**: Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the total number of files is the sum of files infected only by a virus, only by a worm, and by both:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total files} = \\text{Only virus} + \\text{Only worm} + \\text{Both}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the known values:\n   \\[\n   250 = \\text{Only virus} + 125 + 50 \\implies \\text{Only virus} = 250 - 175 = 75\n   \\]\n\n5. **Files not infected by a worm**: Files not infected by a worm are those infected only by a virus. From the calculation above, this number is 75.\n\nThus, the number of files not infected by a worm is **75**, which corresponds to option **C**.\n\nAnswer: C",
