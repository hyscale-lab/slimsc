      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Bill riding his bicycle. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that on a normal day, Bill averages about 15 mph. But on a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. I need to find out how far he can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes. And the options are given, so I'll have to calculate and see which one it matches.\n\nWait, right, speed is distance over time. Oh, right, the formula is distance = speed \u00d7 time. But wait, the time here is given in minutes, so I need to convert that to hours because the speed is in miles per hour.\n\nSo, first, let's find Bill's speed on a windy day. His normal speed is 15 mph, and it's reduced by 4 mph. So 15 minus 4 is 11 mph. Got it, so his speed on a windy day is 11 mph.\n\nNow, the time he's traveling is 21 minutes. I need to convert that into hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 21 divided by 60. Let me calculate that. 21 \u00f7 60 equals... let's see, 0.35 hours. Because 60 times 0.35 is 21. Yep, that's right.\n\nSo now, I can plug these into the distance formula. Distance equals speed multiplied by time. So 11 mph multiplied by 0.35 hours. Let me do the math. 11 times 0.35. Hmm, 10 times 0.35 is 3.5, and 1 times 0.35 is 0.35, so adding them together gives 3.85 miles. Oh wait, but wait, that's exactly one of the options. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking back, the options are A) 2, B) 2.25, C)3.25, D)3.85, E)2.85. So option D is 3.85. That's what I got. But wait, the question says to round to the nearest hundredth. Did I do that correctly?\n\nWait, 11 times 0.35. Let me calculate that again to be precise. 0.35 is 35/100, which is 7/20. So 11 * 7 = 77, and 77 divided by 20 is 3.85. So yes, exactly 3.85. So no rounding needed. Therefore, the answer should be D) 3.85 miles.\n\nWait, but another thought\u2014does 21 minutes make sense? Because sometimes in these problems, people might make a mistake with the time conversion. Let me double-check that. 21 minutes is indeed 21/60 hours, which is 0.35. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about how far he goes per minute. His speed is 11 mph, which is 11 miles per 60 minutes. So per minute, he goes 11/60 miles. So 21 minutes would be 21*(11/60) miles. Let me calculate that: 21*11 is 231, divided by 60 is 3.85. Same result. Yep, definitely correct.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine how far Bill can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes, we start by calculating his speed on a windy day.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my math, but I think I can handle this.\n\nAlright, the question says Bill usually averages about 15 mph on a normal day. But on a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. So first, I need to find out his speed on a windy day. That should be straightforward subtraction, right? So 15 mph minus 4 mph equals 11 mph. Got that down.\n\nNow, the question is asking how far he can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes. Wait, time is in minutes and speed is in hours. I remember that to find distance, I need to use the formula: distance equals speed multiplied by time. But since the units don't match, I need to convert the time from minutes to hours.\n\nLet me think, 21 minutes is what fraction of an hour? Well, there are 60 minutes in an hour, so 21 divided by 60. Let me calculate that. 21 \u00f7 60 is 0.35 hours. Oh right, because 20 minutes would be 1/3, which is about 0.333, so 21 is a bit more, like 0.35 exactly.\n\nSo now, his speed is 11 mph and the time is 0.35 hours. Multiplying those together gives the distance. Let me do the multiplication: 11 * 0.35. Hmm, 11 times 0.3 is 3.3, and 11 times 0.05 is 0.55. Adding those together, 3.3 + 0.55 equals 3.85.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSo, 15 mph minus 4 is definitely 11 mph. 21 minutes is 21/60 hours, which is 0.35. 11 multiplied by 0.35: another way is to think 11 * 35 is 385, then divide by 100, which gives 3.85.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Bill and his bicycle. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. \n\nBill usually averages about 15 mph on a normal day. But on a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. The question is, how far can he travel on a windy day in 21 minutes? And I have to round to the nearest hundredth. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.\n\nHmm, alright. Let's break this down. First, I need to find Bill's speed on a windy day. His normal speed is 15 mph, but it's reduced by 4 mph when it's windy. So I subtract 4 from 15. Let me do that: 15 minus 4 is 11. So his speed on a windy day is 11 mph. Got that.\n\nNext, I need to calculate how far he can go in 21 minutes at that speed. Wait, but speed is in hours, right? So the time given is in minutes. I think I need to convert minutes to hours because speed is miles per hour. \n\nSo, 21 minutes is what in hours? Well, an hour is 60 minutes, so 21 divided by 60 should give me the hours. Let me compute that. 21 divided by 60 is... 0.35 hours. Because 60 times 0.35 is 21. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nNow, distance is calculated by multiplying speed by time. So the formula is distance = speed \u00d7 time. Plugging in the numbers: 11 mph multiplied by 0.35 hours. Let me do that multiplication. \n\n11 times 0.35. Hmm, 10 times 0.35 is 3.5, and 1 times 0.35 is 0.35. So adding them together, 3.5 plus 0.35 equals 3.85 miles. Wait, but the options don't have 3.85 as the first choice. Let me check the options again. Oh, option D is 3.85, so that's an option.\n\nWait a second, but let me make sure I didn't make a calculation mistake. 11 times 0.35. Let me compute it another way. 0.35 is 35/100, so 11 * 35 = 385, then divided by 100 is 3.85. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the distance he can travel is 3.85 miles. Looking at the options, that's option D. So the correct answer should be D) 3.85 miles.\n\nI think that's right. Let me double-check all the steps. Calculated the reduced speed correctly (15-4=11), converted time correctly (21/60=0.35), multiplied correctly (11*0.35=3.85), and the option matches. So I'm confident the answer is D.\n",

Hmm, the question is asking how far Bill can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes. I remember that distance equals speed multiplied by time, right?\n\nAlright, let's break it down. Bill's usual speed is 15 mph. But on a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. So I need to subtract 4 from 15. Let me calculate that: 15 minus 4 equals 11. So his speed on a windy day is 11 mph.
