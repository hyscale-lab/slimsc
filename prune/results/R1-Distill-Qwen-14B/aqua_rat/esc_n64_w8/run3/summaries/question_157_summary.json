      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe question says: In a survey of students, each student selected from a list of 10 songs the 2 songs that the student liked best. If each song was selected 5 times, how many students were surveyed?\n\nHmm, so each student picks two favorite songs from 10. And each song was chosen a total of 5 times. We need to find the number of students.\n\nLet me break this down. Each student selects 2 songs, so each student contributes 2 selections. So if there are N students, the total number of selections made by all students is 2*N.\n\nNow, the problem states that each song was selected 5 times. There are 10 songs, so the total number of selections across all songs is 10 * 5 = 50.\n\nWait, because each song was picked 5 times, so 10 songs multiplied by 5 each gives 50 total selections.\n\nBut earlier I thought that the total selections are 2*N. So 2*N = 50.\n\nTo find N, I can rearrange that equation. N = 50 / 2 = 25.\n\nWait, so that would mean the number of students is 25. Looking at the options, option D is 25. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If each of the 10 songs was selected 5 times, that's 50 total selections. Each student makes 2, so 50 divided by 2 is 25 students. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nSo the answer should be D)25.\n",

So the total number of selections across all songs is 10 * 5 = 50.\n\nBecause each song contributes 5 to the total count.\n\nWait, so if each of the 10 songs is picked 5 times, the total number of song selections is 10 * 5 = 50. And each student contributes exactly 2 song selections. So the number of students must be the total selections divided by 2.\n\nSo 50 / 2 = 25 students.\n\nLooking at the options, D is 25. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Suppose there are 25 students. Each picks 2 songs, so 25*2=50 song selections. Each of the 10 songs is picked 5 times (10*5=50). That matches. So yes, 25 students. That makes sense.\n",

Alright, the problem says that in a survey of students, each student selected from a list of 10 songs the 2 songs they liked best. And each song was selected 5 times. The question is, how many students were surveyed?\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. Each student picks 2 songs. So for each student, two songs are chosen. Now, each song was selected 5 times. Wait, does that mean each song was chosen by 5 different students? Or does it mean each song was selected a total of 5 times across all students? I think it's the latter. Because if each song was selected 5 times, regardless of how many students, that's the total number of times each song was picked.\n\nSo, let's think about the total number of song selections. There are 10 songs, each selected 5 times. So the total number of song selections is 10 * 5 = 50.\n\nBut each student selects 2 songs. So the total number of song selections is equal to the number of students multiplied by 2. So if the total is 50, then the number of students is 50 divided by 2, which is 25.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let's think about it another way. Suppose each student picks two songs, so each contributes two selections. Each song being picked 5 times means that the sum of all selections is 10 * 5 =50.
