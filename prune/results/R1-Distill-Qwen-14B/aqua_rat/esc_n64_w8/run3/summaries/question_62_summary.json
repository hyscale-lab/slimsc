      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says: Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. The sum of R and T's ages is 50 years. And the question is asking for the definite difference between R and Q's age.\n\nHmm. So, first, I think I should try to translate the given information into equations. Let's denote their ages with variables. Let me assign variables:\n\nLet Q's age be Q,\nR's age be R,\nT's age be T.\n\nThe first statement: Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So, the difference between R and Q is the same as the difference between Q and T. But wait, since Q is younger than R, R is older than Q by some amount, and Q is older than T by the same amount. So, R is older than Q by the same amount that Q is older than T.\n\nSo, mathematically, that would mean R - Q = Q - T. Because the difference between R and Q is equal to the difference between Q and T. So, R - Q = Q - T.\n\nLet me write that down as equation (1):\nR - Q = Q - T.\n\nThen, the second piece of information is that the sum of R and T's ages is 50. So, R + T = 50. That's equation (2).\n\nSo now, I have two equations:\n\n1) R - Q = Q - T\n2) R + T = 50\n\nI need to find the difference between R and Q's age, which is R - Q. So, the question is asking for R - Q, and whether it's definitely a certain value.\n\nLet me try to solve these equations. Let's rearrange equation (1):\n\nR - Q = Q - T\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nR - Q - Q + T = 0\nR + T - 2Q = 0\n\nBut from equation (2), R + T = 50. So substituting that into the above equation:\n\n50 - 2Q = 0\n\nBecause R + T is 50, so 50 - 2Q = 0.\n\nSo, 50 = 2Q \u2192 Q = 25.\n\nWait, so Q is 25? That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, knowing that Q is 25, can I find R and T?\n\nFrom equation (2): R + T = 50.\n\nFrom equation (1): R - Q = Q - T.\n\nWe can write this as R - 25 = 25 - T. So, R + T = 50. Oh wait, that's equation (2) again. So, I'm not getting any new information. So, I can't find exact values for R and T individually, but maybe I can find R - Q.\n\nWait, since R - Q = Q - T, and Q is 25, then R - 25 = 25 - T.\n\nBut R + T =50. Let's think: Let me express T in terms of R.\n\nFrom equation (2), T = 50 - R.\n\nSubstitute T into R -25 = 25 - T:\n\nR -25 = 25 - (50 - R)\nSimplify the right side:\n\n25 - (50 - R) = 25 -50 + R = -25 + R.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nR -25 = (-25 + R)\n\nHmm, wait a second. Let me write that again:\n\nR -25 = (25 - T) \u2192 R -25 = 25 - (50 - R) \u2192 R -25 = 25 -50 + R \u2192 R -25 = R -25.\n\nWait, that's an identity. So, it's always true, which means that the equations are dependent. So, I can't get unique values for R and T. But wait, the question is asking for R - Q. Since Q is 25, R - Q is R -25.\n\nBut from equation (1), R -25 = 25 - T. And since T =50 - R, substituting:\n\nR -25 =25 - (50 - R)\nR -25 =25 -50 + R \u2192 R -25 = R -25.\n\nAgain, this doesn't give any new info. So, I can't find R individually. But wait, does R - Q equal to Q - T, which is 25 - T. But T is 50 - R. So, 25 - T = 25 - (50 - R) = R -25. So R - Q = R -25. Which is the same as saying R -25 = R -25. So, this is a tautology, meaning the initial equations are dependent and don't allow us to find exact values for R and T beyond what's given.\n\nWait, but maybe I can express R - Q in terms of known quantities. Wait, from equation (1), R - Q = Q - T. So, R - Q = Q - T. And since Q is 25, that's R -25 =25 - T.\n\nBut from equation (2), R + T =50 \u2192 T =50 - R.\n\nSubstituting T into R -25 =25 - T:\n\nR -25 =25 - (50 - R) \u2192 R -25 =25 -50 + R \u2192 R -25 = R -25. Which again, is an identity. So, it doesn't help.\n\nSo, what can we conclude? We can find Q's age as 25, but R and T can vary as long as their sum is 50 and the difference between R and Q is equal to the difference between Q and T.\n\nWait, for example, if R is 35, then T would be 15. Because 35 +15 =50. Then, R -Q =35 -25=10, and Q-T=25-15=10. So yes, that works.\n\nAlternatively, if R is 30, then T would be 20. R-Q=5, Q-T=5. So that also works.\n\nWait, but in both cases, R - Q is the same as Q - T. But the value of R-Q varies depending on R and T. Wait, wait no, wait. Because in the first case R-Q was 10, and in the second case 5. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous thought.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, let me see. Because if R is 35, then T is 15. So R-Q=10, Q-T=10. So R-Q=10.\n\nIf R is 30, T is 20. R-Q=5, Q-T=5. So R-Q=5. So the difference varies. So that would mean that the difference R - Q can be any value, as long as R + T is 50 and R-Q= Q-T.\n\nWait, but earlier when I solved the equations, I found that Q must be 25. So Q is fixed, but R and T can vary as long as R + T=50 and R-Q = Q-T.\n\nSo, the difference R - Q is equal to Q - T. But since Q is 25, then R -25 =25 - T.\n\nBut since R + T=50 \u2192 T=50 - R.\n\nSo substituting into R -25 =25 - T \u2192 R -25=25 - (50 - R) \u2192 R -25=25-50 + R \u2192 R-25= R -25.\n\nWhich is always true, so R can be any value, as long as T=50 - R.\n\nBut wait, that would mean that R can be any value, but R must be greater than Q=25 because R is older than Q. Because the problem says Q is younger than R. So R must be greater than Q, which is 25. So R>25.\n\nWait, but T must be younger than Q because Q is older than T. Because Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So T must be less than Q=25. So T <25.\n\nSo R must be >25, and T must be <25, and R + T=50.\n\nSo, for example, R could be 30, T=20. R could be 35, T=15. R could be 26, T=24. Wait, no, because T has to be less than Q=25. So T must be less than 25. So, R would be greater than 25, because R=50-T, and T is less than 25, so R would be greater than 25.\n\nWait, but when T is less than 25, R would be 50-T. So if T is 24, R is 26. But wait, then R is 26, which is greater than Q=25, so that's okay. So R can be 26, T=24. Then R-Q=1, Q-T=1. So R-Q is 1.\n\nAlternatively, R could be 40, T=10. Then R-Q=15, Q-T=15. So in this case, R-Q is 15.\n\nSo, the difference R-Q can be any value, as long as R + T=50 and R-Q=Q-T. But from our earlier equations, we found that Q must be 25.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought through the equations, I found that Q must be 25. Because from equation (1), R + T -2Q=0, and equation (2) says R+T=50. So 50 -2Q=0 \u2192 Q=25.\n\nSo Q is fixed at 25. But R can vary, as long as T=50-R, and R>25, T<25.\n\nSo R-Q can be any positive number, but it's determined by the value of R.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the question is asking for the definitely the difference between R and Q's age. So the options are given, but perhaps the answer is that it can't be determined because R and T can vary as long as their sum is 50 and the differences are equal.\n\nWait, no, because from earlier, when I substituted, I found that Q is 25. So R -25 =25 - T. But since T=50-R, substituting gives R-25=25-(50-R) \u2192 R-25=25-50 + R \u2192 R-25= R-25 \u2192 0=0. So, that's always true.\n\nWhich means that R can be any value greater than 25, as long as T=50-R is less than 25.\n\nSo, the difference R-Q is R-25. But R can vary. So, the difference R-Q can be any positive number, depending on R.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the problem is giving multiple-choice options, and one of them is 'Cannot be determined'. So, perhaps the answer is that it cannot be determined because R and T can vary as long as R+T=50 and the differences are equal, so R-Q could be any value, but in reality, R-Q is R-25, which can vary.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Let me try to find R-Q in terms of known quantities.\n\nWait, from equation (1), R - Q = Q - T \u2192 R - Q =25 - T.\n\nBut from equation (2), T=50 - R.\n\nSubstituting into R -25=25 - T:\n\nR -25 =25 - (50 - R)\nSimplify the right side: 25 -50 + R = R -25.\n\nSo R -25 = R -25. So this is an identity, meaning that the equations don't give any new information beyond Q=25. So, R can be any value, as long as R>25 and T=50-R <25.\n\nSo, R-Q can be any value greater than 0, but the problem is asking for the definite difference. So, it's impossible to determine a specific value for R-Q. It depends on R and T's specific ages, which are not given.\n\nSo the answer would be D) Cannot be determined.\n\nWait, but looking back at the problem statement, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations. Let me double-check.\n\nThe first statement: Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So, the difference R-Q = Q-T. So, R-Q=Q-T \u2192 R = 2Q - T.\n\nEquation (2): R + T =50.\n\nSo, substituting R=2Q-T into equation (2):\n\n(2Q - T) + T =50 \u2192 2Q =50 \u2192 Q=25.\n\nSo yes, Q must be 25. So that's fixed.\n\nSo, R=2Q-T \u2192 R=50 - T (from equation 2, R=50-T). So substituting into R=2Q-T:\n\n50 - T =2*25 - T \u2192 50 -T=50 - T \u2192 0=0. Again, an identity.\n\nSo, Q=25, and R=50-T.\n\nSo, R-Q= (50-T)-25=25-T.\n\nBut since T must be less than Q=25, because Q is older than T. So T <25.\n\nSo, R-Q=25-T. Since T can be any value less than 25, R-Q can be any value greater than zero up to 25 (since T can be as low as 0, but realistically, ages can't be negative, so T must be >=0, making R=50-T <=50. So when T approaches 0, R approaches 50, so R-Q approaches 25. So R-Q can be any positive number up to 25.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the options are A)22, B)27, C)29, D)Cannot be determined, E)None of the above.\n\nSo, since R-Q can be any value between 0 and 25, but the options don't include any of those, except perhaps E) None of the above. But wait, the question is asking for the definite difference. So, perhaps the answer is that it's not possible to determine a specific value, so the answer is D) Cannot be determined.\n\nWait, but another way to look at it: perhaps the difference is fixed.\n\nWait, wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations earlier.\n\nWait, from equation (1): R - Q = Q - T \u2192 R + T = 2Q.\n\nBut equation (2) says R + T =50. So, 2Q=50 \u2192 Q=25.\n\nSo, R + T=50 and R-T =2Q - 2T? No, wait, no, R-T would be (R-Q)+(Q-T) \u2192 but wait, that's not necessarily correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that R - Q = Q - T \u2192 R + T =2Q. So, R + T=50, so 2Q=50 \u2192 Q=25.\n\nSo, the difference R - Q is equal to Q - T, which is (25 - T). But from equation (2), T=50 - R.\n\nSo, substituting into R -25=25 - (50 - R):\n\nR -25=25 -50 + R \u2192 R-25= R-25. Again, an identity.\n\nSo, the only definite thing is that Q=25, but R and T can vary as long as R + T=50 and R>25, T<25.\n\nSo, R-Q can be any value between 0 and 25, but the problem is asking for the difference between R and Q's age. So, the difference can't be uniquely determined because it depends on R and T's ages. So, the correct answer is D) Cannot be determined.\n",

So the options are given, but perhaps the answer is that it can't be determined because R and T can vary as long as their sum is 50 and the differences are equal.\n\nWait, no, because from earlier, when I substituted, I found that Q is 25. So R -25 =25 - T. But since T=50-R, substituting gives R-25=25-(50-R) \u2192 R-25=25-50 + R \u2192 R-25= R-25 \u2192 0=0. So, that's always true.\n\nWhich means that R can be any value greater than 25, as long as T=50-R is less than 25.\n\nSo, the difference R-Q is R-25. But R can vary. So, the difference R-Q can be any positive number, depending on R.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the problem is giving multiple-choice options, and one of them is 'Cannot be determined'. So, perhaps the answer is that it cannot be determined because R and T can vary as long as R+T=50 and the differences are equal, so R-Q could be any value, but in reality, R-Q is R-25, which can vary.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Let me try to find R-Q in terms of known quantities.\n\nWait, from equation (1), R - Q = Q - T \u2192 R - Q =25 - T.\n\nBut from equation (2), T=50 - R.\n\nSubstituting into R -25=25 - T:\n\nR -25 =25 - (50 - R)\nSimplify the right side: 25 -50 + R = R -25.\n\nSo R -25 = R -25. So this is an identity, meaning that the equations don't give any new information beyond Q=25. So, R can be any value, as long as R>25 and T=50-R <25.\n\nSo, R-Q can be any value greater than 0, but the problem is asking for the definite difference. So, it's impossible to determine a specific value for R-Q. It depends on R and T's specific ages, which are not given.\n\nSo the answer would be D) Cannot be determined.\n\nWait, but looking back at the problem statement, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations. Let me double-check.\n\nThe first statement: Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So, the difference R-Q = Q-T. So, R-Q=Q-T \u2192 R = 2Q - T.\n\nEquation (2): R + T =50.\n\nSo, substituting R=2Q-T into equation (2):\n\n(2Q - T) + T =50 \u2192 2Q =50 \u2192 Q=25.\n\nSo yes, Q must be 25. So that's fixed.\n\nSo, R=2Q-T \u2192 R=50 - T (from equation 2, R=50-T). So substituting into R=2Q-T:\n\n50 - T =2*25 - T \u2192 50 -T=50 - T \u2192 0=0. Again, an identity.\n\nSo, Q=25, and R=50-T.\n\nSo, R-Q= (50-T)-25=25-T.\n\nBut since T must be less than Q=25, because Q is older than T. So T <25.\n\nSo, R-Q=25-T. Since T can be any value less than 25, R-Q can be any value greater than zero up to 25 (since T can be as low as 0, but realistically, ages can't be negative, so T must be >=0, making R=50-T <=50. So when T approaches 0, R approaches 50, so R-Q approaches 25. So R-Q can be any positive number up to 25.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the options are A)22, B)27, C)29, D)Cannot be determined, E)None of the above.\n\nSo, since R-Q can be any value between 0 and 25, but the options don't include any of those, except perhaps E) None of the above. But wait, the question is asking for the definite difference. So, perhaps the answer is that it's not possible to determine a specific value, so the answer is D) Cannot be determined.\n\nWait, but another way to look at it: perhaps the difference is fixed.\n\nWait, wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations earlier.\n\nWait, from equation (1): R - Q = Q - T \u2192 R + T = 2Q.\n\nBut equation (2) says R + T =50. So, 2Q=50 \u2192 Q=25.\n\nSo, R + T=50 and R-T =2Q - 2T? No, wait, no, R-T would be (R-Q)+(Q-T) \u2192 but wait, that's not necessarily correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that R - Q = Q - T \u2192 R + T =2Q. So, R + T=50, so 2Q=50 \u2192 Q=25.\n\nSo, the difference R - Q is equal to Q - T, which is (25 - T). But from equation (2), T=50 - R.\n\nSo, substituting into R -25=25 - (50 - R):\n\nR -25=25 -50 + R \u2192 R-25= R-25. Again, an identity.\n\nSo, the only definite thing is that Q=25, but R and T can vary as long as R + T=50 and R>25, T<25.\n\nSo, R-Q can be any value between 0 and 25, but the problem is asking for the difference between R and Q's age. So, the difference can't be uniquely determined because it depends on R and T's ages. So, the correct answer is D) Cannot be determined.\n\n\nThe problem states that Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T, and the sum of R and T's ages is 50. We are tasked with finding the definite difference between R and Q's age.\n\n### Step 1: Translate the problem into equations\nLet the ages of Q, R, and T be denoted as \\( Q \\), \\( R \\), and \\( T \\), respectively.\n\n1. The first statement, \"Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T,\" implies that the difference between R and Q is the same as the difference between Q and T:\n   \\[\n   R - Q = Q - T \\tag{1}\n   \\]\n\n2. The second statement gives the sum of R and T's ages:\n   \\[\n   R + T = 50 \\tag{2}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 2: Solve the equations\nFrom equation (1):\n\\[\nR - Q = Q - T \\implies R + T = 2Q\n\\]\n\nFrom equation (2):\n\\[\nR + T = 50\n\\]\n\nEquating the two expressions for \\( R + T \\):\n\\[\n2Q = 50 \\implies Q = 25\n\\]\n\nThus, Q's age is fixed at 25 years.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the difference \\( R - Q \\)\nFrom equation (1):\n\\[\nR - Q = Q - T\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( Q = 25 \\):\n\\[\nR - 25 = 25 - T\n\\]\n\nFrom equation (2):\n\\[\nT = 50 - R\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( T = 50 - R \\) into \\( R - 25 = 25 - T \\):\n\\[\nR - 25 = 25 - (50 - R) \\implies R - 25 = R - 25\n\\]\n\nThis is an identity, meaning the equations are dependent and do not provide additional constraints on \\( R \\) or \\( T \\). Therefore, \\( R \\) and \\( T \\) can vary as long as:\n- \\( R + T = 50 \\)\n- \\( R > Q = 25 \\) (since Q is younger than R)\n- \\( T < Q = 25 \\) (since Q is older than T)\n\n### Step 4: Determine the difference \\( R - Q \\)\nThe difference \\( R - Q \\) is \\( R - 25 \\). Since \\( R \\) can vary as long as \\( R > 25 \\) and \\( T = 50 - R < 25 \\), \\( R - Q \\) can take any positive value up to 25. However, the problem asks for the **definite difference**, which cannot be uniquely determined because \\( R \\) and \\( T \\) are not uniquely constrained.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe difference between \\( R \\) and \\( Q \\)'s age cannot be determined definitively based on the given information.\n\n**Answer: D**",

From the equation r - q = q - t, since we know q is 25, let's see what else we can find.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't give individual ages for R or T, only their sum. So, we can't find their exact ages. So, can we find R - Q in terms of the given information?\n\nWe have r + t =50 and r - q = q - t.\n\nLet me think again. Since r - q = q - t, let's express this as (r - q) = (q - t).

So, the difference between R and Q is the same as the difference between Q and T. So, if I denote the difference as d, then R = Q + d and T = Q - d. Because Q is younger than R by d, and older than T by d.\n\nSo, R = 25 + d and T =25 - d. Then, R + T = (25 + d) + (25 - d) =50. Which matches the given sum of R and T being 50.\n\nSo, that doesn't give me any new information because it's always 50. So, the differences could be any value, as long as R is older than Q by d and T is younger than Q by d. \n\nBut the question is asking for the definite difference between R and Q's age.

Similarly, since Q is older than T by the same 'x' years, T must be Q - x years old.\n\nWait, no. Let me get that right. If Q is younger than R by x, that means R is older than Q by x. So R = Q + x. On the other hand, Q is older than T by x, so T = Q - x.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. If Q is older than T by x years, then T is Q minus x. So T = Q - x.

Because when I add R and T, the x's cancel out, leaving me with Q*2=50, so Q=25.\n\nSo, x could be any value, right? Because the problem doesn't provide enough information about x.

Therefore, Q = 25.\n\nWait, but I'm trying to find the difference between R and Q's age. R is Q + x, so R = 25 + x. So R - Q = x.\n\nBut wait, what's x? From the earlier equations, x is the difference between Q and T. Because T is Q - x, so x is the amount Q is older than T.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the difference between R and Q. Which is x. But from R + T =50, we found that Q is 25. But what about x?\n\nHmm, from R + T =50, substituting R = Q +x and T = Q -x, we get 2Q=50. So Q is 25. But x isn't determined by this equation. Because when I add R and T, the x's cancel out, leaving me with Q*2=50, so Q=25.\n\nSo, x could be any value, right? Because the problem doesn't provide enough information about x. So R is 25 + x, and T is 25 - x.\n\nWait, but the sum of R and T is 50, which is satisfied regardless of x. So x could be any number, meaning the difference between R and Q (which is x) could be any number. Therefore, the difference between R and Q's age is x, but we don't have enough data to find the value of x.\n\nSo the question is asking, what is definitely the difference between R and Q's age? But since x isn't determined, the answer can't be determined from the given information.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Let me try plugging in some numbers to see.\n\nSuppose Q is 25, as we found. Let's say x is 5. Then R would be 30, T would be 20. R + T =50. That works. The difference between R and Q is 5.\n\nAlternatively, x could be 10. R is 35, T is 15. Sum is 50. Difference between R and Q is 10.\n\nSo in different scenarios, the difference (x) can vary. So without more information, we can't find a specific value for x.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the difference cannot be determined from the given data.\n\nLooking at the options, D says \"Cannot be determined\". So the answer should be D.\n\n\nThe problem states: \"Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T,\" which translates to the difference between R and Q being the same as the difference between Q and T. Let this common difference be \\( x \\). Thus, \\( R = Q + x \\) and \\( T = Q - x \\).\n\nThe second part of the problem states that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. Substituting the expressions for \\( R \\) and \\( T \\) into this equation gives:\n\n\\[\nR + T = 50 \\implies (Q + x) + (Q - x) = 50.\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this:\n\n\\[\n2Q = 50 \\implies Q = 25.\n\\]\n\nNow, the problem asks for the difference between \\( R \\) and \\( Q \\)'s age, which is \\( x \\). However, the equations do not provide any additional constraints to determine the value of \\( x \\). For example:\n\n- If \\( x = 5 \\), then \\( R = 30 \\) and \\( T = 20 \\), with \\( R + T = 50 \\).\n- If \\( x = 10 \\), then \\( R = 35 \\) and \\( T = 15 \\), with \\( R + T = 50 \\).\n\nIn both cases, the sum \\( R + T = 50 \\) is satisfied, but the value of \\( x \\) (and thus the difference between \\( R \\) and \\( Q \\)) varies. Since \\( x \\) cannot be uniquely determined from the given information, the difference between \\( R \\) and \\( Q \\)'s age cannot be definitively calculated.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: D**",

Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe question says: Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. Hmm, that's a bit of a tricky wording. So, I think it means that the difference between Q's age and R's age is the same as the difference between Q's age and T's age, but in the opposite direction. Like, Q is younger than R by a certain number of years, and older than T by the same number of years.\n\nSo if I let the differences be 'x' years, then R is x years older than Q, and Q is x years older than T. So R = Q + x, and T = Q - x. Alternatively, maybe it's better to represent it mathematically.\n\nLet me assign variables to each person's age. Let Q be q years old, R be r years old, and T be t years old.\n\nThe statement \"Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T\" can be translated into an equation. The difference between R and Q is the same as the difference between Q and T. So, R - Q = Q - T.

Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says, \"Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T.\" Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let me break it down. So Q's age difference with R is the same as his age difference with T. Wait, but R is older than Q, right? Because Q is younger than R. And T is younger than Q, since Q is older than T. So the difference between R and Q is the same as the difference between Q and T.\n\nLet me think of variables. Let's say Q's age is q, R's age is r, and T's age is t. The first part says Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So the difference between R and Q is the same as the difference between Q and T. That would mean r - q = q - t. Because R is older, so r - q is positive. T is younger, so q - t is positive. So both differences are the same.\n\nThe second part of the question says that the sum of R and T's ages is 50. So r + t = 50.\n\nI need to find the difference between R and Q's age, which is r - q. But I don't know the individual ages yet. Maybe I can express everything in terms of one variable.\n\nFrom the first equation: r - q = q - t. Let's rearrange that. r - q = q - t \u2192 r + t = 2q. Oh wait, because if I add q and t to both sides, I get r = 2q - t. Hmm, but I also know that r + t =50. So substituting r from the first equation into the second.\n\nWait, from r + t =50, if I have r = 2q - t (from rearranging the first equation), then substituting into r + t gives (2q - t) + t = 50 \u2192 2q =50 \u2192 q=25.\n\nOh, so Q's age is 25? That's interesting. So if q is 25, then from the first equation, r -25 =25 - t. So r + t = 50, which we already knew. But wait, how does that help me find r - q?\n\nWait, r - q is the same as 25 - t, right? Because from the first equation, r - q = q - t \u2192 r - q = 25 - t. But I also know that r + t =50.\n\nLet me think about it again. If q is 25, then what about r and t?\n\nFrom r -25 =25 - t \u2192 r + t =50. Which is exactly what the problem says. So that doesn't give me new information. Hmm, so maybe I can express r in terms of t or vice versa.\n\nLet me take the equation r -25 =25 -t \u2192 r = 25 + (25 - t) \u2192 r =50 -t. Oh, because r + t =50, so r =50 -t. So substituting back, r =50 -t.\n\nSo if r =50 -t, then r - q is (50 -t) -25 =25 -t. But wait, from the first equation, r - q = q - t, which is 25 -t. So that's the same as the difference between r and q.\n\nBut I need the value of r - q. Wait, but I don't have t's value. Because all I know is that r + t =50. So let's say t is x. Then r would be 50 - x. And from the equation r - q =25 -x. But q is 25, so r -25 =25 -x \u2192 r=50 -x.\n\nWait, but r=50 -x, which is correct because r +x =50. So that's consistent.\n\nBut then, the difference r - q is 25 -x, but since x is t's age, and I don't have a specific value for x, I can't find a numerical value for r - q. So that suggests that the difference could vary depending on t's age. But wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, no. Because when I substituted, I found that q is 25. So regardless of what t is, q is 25. And the difference between r and q is 25 -t. But since t can be any value as long as r + t =50, the difference could vary.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the difference between R and Q's age. So that's r - q. Let's see, if q is 25, and r is 50 - t, then r - q is (50 - t) -25 =25 - t.\n\nBut without knowing t's exact age, we can't find a specific value for r - q. Because t could be anything, like 20, making r 30, so r - q is 5. Or t could be 30, making r 20, but wait, no, that wouldn't make sense because then Q is 25, and T would be 30, which is older than Q, which contradicts the original statement that Q is older than T.\n\nWait, wait a second. Because the first statement says Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So Q is older than T, meaning T is younger than Q. So t must be less than q, which is 25. So t <25, which means that r =50 - t must be greater than 25, because if t is less than 25, 50 -t is more than 25. So r is greater than 25, as expected because R is older than Q.\n\nSo t must be less than 25. So t can be 20, then r is 30. Then r - q is 5. Or t can be 24, then r is 26, and r - q is 1. So the difference between R and Q can vary. So the difference isn't fixed; it depends on t's age.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the difference between R and Q's age. So the question is, what is definitely the difference? Because the problem gives only the sum of R and T's ages, and the relation between Q, R, and T.\n\nWait, but from earlier, when I substituted, I found that q is 25. So regardless of t, q is 25. And since r is 50 -t, then r - q is (50 -t) -25 =25 -t. But t can vary as long as it's less than 25.\n\nSo the difference r - q is 25 - t, which depends on t. Since t isn't given, we can't find a specific value. So the answer would be that the difference cannot be determined from the information given.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is \"Cannot be determined\". So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me go through the equations again.\n\nWe have:\n\n1) r - q = q - t \u2192 r + t = 2q.\n\n2) r + t =50.\n\nFrom 1 and 2, 2q=50 \u2192 q=25.\n\nSo, Q is 25. Then, from equation 1, r -25 =25 -t \u2192 r + t =50.\n\nSo from this, we can't find r - q as a fixed number because t can vary. For example:\n\nCase 1: If t=20, then r=30. So r - q=5.\n\nCase 2: If t=24, then r=26. So r - q=1.\n\nCase 3: If t=10, then r=40. So r - q=15.\n\nIn each case, the sum r +t is 50, and Q is 25, but the difference between R and Q varies.\n\nSo the difference R and Q can't be determined uniquely; it depends on t's age.\n\nSo the correct answer is D) Cannot be determined.\n",

So that doesn't give me new information. Hmm, so maybe I can express r in terms of t or vice versa.\n\nLet me take the equation r -25 =25 -t \u2192 r = 25 + (25 - t) \u2192 r =50 -t. Oh, because r + t =50, so r =50 -t. So substituting back, r =50 -t.\n\nSo if r =50 -t, then r - q is (50 -t) -25 =25 -t. But wait, from the first equation, r - q = q - t, which is 25 -t. So that's the same as the difference between r and q.\n\nBut I need the value of r - q. Wait, but I don't have t's value. Because all I know is that r + t =50. So let's say t is x. Then r would be 50 - x. And from the equation r - q =25 -x. But q is 25, so r -25 =25 -x \u2192 r=50 -x.\n\nWait, but r=50 -x, which is correct because r +x =50. So that's consistent.\n\nBut then, the difference r - q is 25 -x, but since x is t's age, and I don't have a specific value for x, I can't find a numerical value for r - q. So that suggests that the difference could vary depending on t's age. But wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, no. Because when I substituted, I found that q is 25. So regardless of what t is, q is 25. And the difference between r and q is 25 -t. But since t can be any value as long as r + t =50, the difference could vary.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the difference between R and Q's age. So that's r - q. Let's see, if q is 25, and r is 50 - t, then r - q is (50 - t) -25 =25 - t.\n\nBut without knowing t's exact age, we can't find a specific value for r - q. Because t could be anything, like 20, making r 30, so r - q is 5. Or t could be 30, making r 20, but wait, no, that wouldn't make sense because then Q is 25, and T would be 30, which is older than Q, which contradicts the original statement that Q is older than T.\n\nWait, wait a second. Because the first statement says Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So Q is older than T, meaning T is younger than Q. So t must be less than q, which is 25. So t <25, which means that r =50 - t must be greater than 25, because if t is less than 25, 50 -t is more than 25. So r is greater than 25, as expected because R is older than Q.\n\nSo t must be less than 25. So t can be 20, then r is 30. Then r - q is 5. Or t can be 24, then r is 26, and r - q is 1. So the difference between R and Q can vary. So the difference isn't fixed; it depends on t's age.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the difference between R and Q's age. So the question is, what is definitely the difference? Because the problem gives only the sum of R and T's ages, and the relation between Q, R, and T.\n\nWait, but from earlier, when I substituted, I found that q is 25. So regardless of t, q is 25. And since r is 50 -t, then r - q is (50 -t) -25 =25 -t. But t can vary as long as it's less than 25.\n\nSo the difference r - q is 25 - t, which depends on t. Since t isn't given, we can't find a specific value. So the answer would be that the difference cannot be determined from the information given.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is \"Cannot be determined\". So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me go through the equations again.\n\nWe have:\n\n1) r - q = q - t \u2192 r + t = 2q.\n\n2) r + t =50.\n\nFrom 1 and 2, 2q=50 \u2192 q=25.\n\nSo, Q is 25. Then, from equation 1, r -25 =25 -t \u2192 r + t =50.\n\nSo from this, we can't find r - q as a fixed number because t can vary. For example:\n\nCase 1: If t=20, then r=30. So r - q=5.\n\nCase 2: If t=24, then r=26. So r - q=1.\n\nCase 3: If t=10, then r=40. So r - q=15.\n\nIn each case, the sum r +t is 50, and Q is 25, but the difference between R and Q varies.\n\nSo the difference R and Q can't be determined uniquely; it depends on t's age.\n\nSo the correct answer is D) Cannot be determined.\n\n\nThe problem states that \"Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T,\" which translates to the equation \\( r - q = q - t \\). Rearranging this gives \\( r + t = 2q \\). Additionally, the problem provides that the sum of R and T's ages is 50, i.e., \\( r + t = 50 \\). \n\nFrom the first equation, substituting \\( r + t = 50 \\) into \\( r + t = 2q \\), we find \\( 2q = 50 \\), so \\( q = 25 \\). Thus, Q's age is fixed at 25. Substituting \\( q = 25 \\) back into \\( r - q = q - t \\), we get \\( r - 25 = 25 - t \\), which simplifies to \\( r + t = 50 \\), consistent with the given information.\n\nTo find the difference \\( r - q \\), we note that \\( r = 50 - t \\). Therefore, \\( r - q = (50 - t) - 25 = 25 - t \\). However, since \\( t \\) is not specified, it can vary as long as \\( t < 25 \\) (because Q is older than T). This means the difference \\( r - q \\) depends on \\( t \\), and without additional information, it cannot be uniquely determined.\n\nThus, the difference between R and Q's age cannot be definitively calculated from the given data.\n\nAnswer: D",

Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, let's parse the statement. The phrase \"Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T.\" So, what does that mean? I think it means the difference between R and Q is the same as the difference between Q and T. So, if Q is younger than R by a certain number of years, he is older than T by the same number. Like, R is older than Q by x years, and Q is older than T by x years. So, R = Q + x and Q = T + x. Therefore, R = T + 2x. Wait, that makes sense because the difference between R and T would be twice the difference between Q and either R or T.\n\nThe problem also states that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. So, R + T = 50.\n\nWait, but from earlier, I had R = T + 2x. Let me substitute that into the sum equation. So, (T + 2x) + T = 50. That simplifies to 2T + 2x = 50.

Let's assign variables more clearly.\n\nLet me let Q's age be q. Then, since Q is younger than R by x years, R's age is q + x.

So, R =25 +x, T=25 -x.\n\nBut the question is asking for the difference between R and Q's age. R is 25 +x, Q is 25. So, R - Q = x. But how can we find x?\n\nWait, do we have any other equations? Let me see. The problem statement doesn't give any more info. So, all we know is R + T =50 and R = Q + x and T = Q -x. From that, we found Q=25, but x is still unknown.\n\nSo, the difference between R and Q is x, but x can be any value as long as T =25 -x is positive. Because age can't be negative.

I need to find the definite difference between R and Q's age. The options are A to E, with E being none of the above.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I think I'll start by assigning variables to each person's age. Let me denote Q's age as Q, R's as R, and T's as T. \n\nThe first part says, \"Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T.\" So, Q is younger than R by a certain amount, and he is older than T by the same amount.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this age-related problem. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe problem says: Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. So I need to parse that sentence. Let me break it down. \n\nSo, Q's difference in age from R is the same as the difference between Q and T. But wait, Q is younger than R, so the difference would be R minus Q. And Q is older than T, so the difference is Q minus T. So these two differences are equal.\n\nMathematically, I can write this as R - Q = Q - T. Because the amount Q is younger than R is the same as how much older Q is than T.\n\nGot it. So R - Q = Q - T.\n\nThen the problem states that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. So R + T = 50.\n\nWe're supposed to find the definite difference between R and Q's age, which is R - Q. Or maybe Q - R, but since R is older, it'll be R - Q.\n\nLet me write down the equations again:\n\n1) R - Q = Q - T\n2) R + T = 50\n\nHmm, maybe I can express R and T in terms of Q or something. Let me see.\n\nFrom equation 1: R - Q = Q - T. Let me rearrange this. Let's add Q to both sides and add T to both sides. So R + T = 2Q. Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, let's do it step by step. Equation 1:\n\nR - Q = Q - T\n\nLet me add Q to both sides:\n\nR = 2Q - T\n\nAlternatively, I can add T to both sides:\n\nR + T = 2Q\n\nWait, that's the same as equation 2. Because equation 2 is R + T =50. So from equation 1, R + T = 2Q. So 2Q equals 50, so Q is 25.\n\nWait, that's a big step. Let me check.\n\nIf equation 1 leads to R + T = 2Q, and equation 2 says R + T =50, then 2Q=50, so Q=25.\n\nOh, that's interesting. So Q is 25 years old.\n\nNow, we need to find R - Q. Because the problem asks for the difference between R and Q's age. Since R is older than Q, R - Q is the difference.\n\nBut wait, how? I don't know R or T's individual ages, only their sum. So maybe I can find R in terms of Q or something else.\n\nWait, from equation 1: R - Q = Q - T. We can rearrange this to find R in terms of Q and T, but since R + T is 50, perhaps we can find R in terms of Q.\n\nWait, since R = 2Q - T from equation 1, but R + T =50, substituting R gives 2Q - T + T =50 \u2192 2Q=50 \u2192 Q=25. So that's correct.\n\nSo Q is 25. Now, R + T =50, and R - Q = Q - T.\n\nLet me think about R and T's ages. Let me call the difference between Q and T as D. So D = Q - T.\n\nSince Q is 25, D=25 - T. But R - Q is also D, so R = Q + D =25 + D.\n\nBut R + T =50. Substituting R gives (25 + D) + T =50 \u2192 T =50 -25 - D =25 - D.\n\nBut since D =25 - T, substituting T gives D=25 - (25 - D) \u2192 D=25 -25 + D \u2192 D= D. Hmm, that's just an identity, so it doesn't give new info.\n\nWait, maybe I can express R in terms of Q and T. Since R =25 + D and T=25 - D. So R + T = (25 + D) + (25 - D) =50. Which checks out.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for R - Q. Since R =25 + D and Q=25, R - Q = D. But what is D?\n\nFrom equation 1, D = R - Q = Q - T. So D is the same as the difference between Q and T.\n\nBut we don't have specific values for R and T beyond their sum. So all we know is that R and T add up to 50, and their average is 25. So R is 25 + D, T is 25 - D. \n\nBut without more information, D could be any positive number, as long as R is older than Q and Q is older than T. So, for example, if D is 10, R would be 35 and T would be 15. Then R is 35, Q is 25, T is 15. R - Q =10, Q - T=10. That works.\n\nBut if D is 5, R=30, T=20. Then R - Q=5, Q - T=5. Also works.\n\nSo in all these cases, R - Q is equal to D, but D can vary as long as R and T are positive and sum to 50.\n\nWait, but the question is, what is definitely the difference between R and Q's age? Because D could be any value, as long as R and T are positive. So R could be 30, T=20, D=5. Or R=35, T=15, D=10. Or R=40, T=10, D=15, etc.\n\nIn all these cases, R - Q is D, which varies. So the difference between R and Q could be any number, but the problem is asking for what is definitely the difference.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. From equation 1, R - Q = Q - T. So R - Q = Q - T \u2192 R + T = 2Q. Which we already found Q=25.\n\nSo R - Q = Q - T \u2192 R -25 =25 - T.\n\nBut R + T=50 \u2192 R =50 - T.\n\nSubstituting into R -25 =25 - T \u2192 (50 - T) -25 =25 - T \u2192 25 - T =25 - T. So it's an identity again.\n\nSo no, it's not giving any new information. So the difference between R and Q (R - Q) can't be determined uniquely because it depends on the values of R and T, which aren't fixed beyond their sum.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that from R + T=50 and R - Q=Q - T, we found Q=25. But the difference R - Q is D, which varies. So the difference between R and Q is D, but D isn't fixed.\n\nSo the difference can be any value as long as R and T are positive and add up to 50. For example, if R is 40, T is 10, then R-Q=15, Q-T=15. So D=15. But if R is 30, T is 20, D=5.\n\nWait, but wait, when D is 15, R is 40, which is fine. T is 10, which is fine. So D can vary from 0 up to 25, I suppose. Because if D is 25, then R would be 50, and T would be 0, which is impossible (assuming T is a person, so age can't be zero if Q is 25 and T is younger than Q). So T must be less than 25.\n\nWait, no. Let's think again. T must be less than Q because Q is older than T. So T <25. So R must be greater than Q, which is 25. So R can be from just over 25 to 50 - T, but T is less than 25.\n\nWait, but R is 25 + D, and T is 25 - D. So for T to be positive, 25 - D >0 \u2192 D <25.\n\nSo D can be any positive number less than 25. So R - Q can be any value from just above 0 to just below 25.\n\nSo the difference between R and Q can't be determined to a specific number because there are multiple possible values. Therefore, the answer should be that it cannot be determined, so option D.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, D is 'Cannot be determined'.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me re-examine the problem. The question is, what is definitely the difference between R and Q's age? So the options are numbers, but also an option D says it cannot be determined.\n\nSo the correct answer would be D) Cannot be determined.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me go through it again.\n\nGiven:\n\n1. R - Q = Q - T \u2192 R + T = 2Q \u2192 2Q = R + T \u2192 2Q=50 \u2192 Q=25.\n\n2. So Q is 25. Now, R and T must satisfy R + T=50 and R -25=25 - T.\n\nSo R=50 - T.\n\nSubstituting into R -25=25 - T:\n\n(50 - T) -25 =25 - T \u219225 - T =25 - T \u21920=0.\n\nSo no new information. So R can be any value as long as T is 50 - R, and R is greater than Q=25, and T is less than 25.\n\nSo the difference R - Q can be anything from just over 0 to 24.999..., so any value less than 25.\n\nSo the difference is not fixed; it could be any value. Therefore, the difference can't be determined, so the correct answer is D.\n",
