      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where Charles invested some money a year ago, and now he got $54,080 back, which includes both the interest and the principal. The investment gives an annual interest rate of 8 percent, but it's compounded semi-annually. I need to find out how much he originally invested. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that compound interest means the interest is calculated more than once a year and each time it's added to the principal, so the next period's interest is calculated on the new amount. Since it's compounded semi-annually, that's twice a year. So the formula for compound interest should be something like A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt), right? Where A is the amount after time t, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times it's compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n\nIn this case, the time t is 1 year, the rate r is 8% which is 0.08 as a decimal, and it's compounded semi-annually, so n is 2. So the formula would be A = P (1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1). Simplifying that, 0.08 divided by 2 is 0.04, and 2 times 1 is 2. So the equation becomes A = P * (1.04)^2.\n\nWait, but we know that A is $54,080. So I can plug that into the equation. 54,080 equals P multiplied by (1.04 squared). Let me calculate 1.04 squared. 1.04 * 1.04. Let's see, 1 times 1 is 1, 1 times 0.04 is 0.04, 0.04 times 1 is 0.04, and 0.04 times 0.04 is 0.0016. Adding them up, 1 + 0.04 + 0.04 + 0.0016 = 1.0816. So 1.04 squared is 1.0816.\n\nSo the equation is 54,080 = P * 1.0816. To find P, I need to divide both sides by 1.0816. So P = 54,080 / 1.0816. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 54,080 divided by 1.0816.\n\nWait, let me see. Alternatively, maybe I can think about this as moving the decimal. Let me compute 54,080 \u00f7 1.0816. Maybe I can approximate or see if it comes to one of the options.\n\nWait, let's compute 54,080 / 1.0816. Let me do this division step by step. Alternatively, perhaps I can simplify the denominator. 1.0816 is the same as 10816/10000, so dividing by that is the same as multiplying by 10000/10816.\n\nSo, 54,080 * (10000/10816) = (54,080 * 10000) / 10816. Hmm, that's a big number. Let me compute this.\n\nWait, 54,080 * 10000 is 540,800,000. Now divide that by 10816. Let me see, what's 540,800,000 divided by 10816. Let me do this division.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can factor numerator and denominator. Let me see if 10816 divides into 540,800,000. Hmm, perhaps I can find a common factor. Let me think, 10816 is 100^2 + 8^2, but maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 540800000 / 10816.\n\nWait, perhaps I can simplify the numbers by dividing numerator and denominator by 16. Let's see: 10816 \u00f716= 676. Because 16*676=10816. And 540,800,000 \u00f716 is 33,800,000. So now the division is 33,800,000 / 676.\n\nHmm, that's easier. Now, let's compute 33,800,000 divided by 676. Let me see how many times 676 fits into 33,800,000.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute 33,800,000 \u00f7 676. Let me try dividing both by 4: 676 \u00f74 =169, 33,800,000 \u00f74=8,450,000. So now it's 8,450,000 \u00f7169.\n\nHmm, 169 times 50,000 is 8,450,000 because 169 * 50,000 = 8,450,000. So 8,450,000 \u00f7169 = 50,000. So that means 33,800,000 \u00f7676 is 50,000. Therefore, 54,080 /1.0816 is 50,000.\n\nSo the original investment P is $50,000. Looking at the options, that's option B.\n\nLet me double-check. If I invest $50,000 at 8% annual interest, compounded semi-annually, then after 6 months, the amount would be 50,000 *1.04=52,000. Then in the next 6 months, 52,000 *1.04=54,080. Yep, that adds up correctly. So the correct answer is B) $50,000.\n",

So I can plug that into the equation. 54,080 equals P multiplied by (1.04 squared). Let me calculate 1.04 squared. 1.04 * 1.04. Let's see, 1 times 1 is 1, 1 times 0.04 is 0.04, 0.04 times 1 is 0.04, and 0.04 times 0.04 is 0.0016. Adding them up, 1 + 0.04 + 0.04 + 0.0016 = 1.0816.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Charles investing money, and I need to find out how much he originally invested. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nAlright, the question says that after one year, Charles received $54,080, which includes both the principal and the interest. The investment has an annual interest rate of 8 percent, but it's compounded semi-annually. Hmm, I remember that compound interest means the interest is calculated and added to the principal more than once a year. Since it's semi-annual, that's twice a year.\n\nWait, right, the formula for compound interest is A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt), where:\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nIn this case, the time t is 1 year, the rate r is 8%, so that's 0.08 as a decimal. The compounding is semi-annual, so n would be 2. And the amount A is $54,080. I need to find P.\n\nSo plugging the numbers into the formula: 54080 = P * (1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1). Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate 0.08 divided by 2. Oh right, 0.08 /2 is 0.04. So each compounding period gives 4% interest. Then, the exponent is 2 times 1, which is 2. So the formula simplifies to 54080 = P * (1.04)^2.\n\nWhat's (1.04)^2? Let me calculate that. 1.04 multiplied by 1.04. Hmm, 1 times 1 is 1. 1 times 0.04 is 0.04. 0.04 times 1 is another 0.04, and 0.04 times 0.04 is 0.0016. Wait, maybe a quicker way is 1.04 squared. 1.04 * 1.04. Let me do it as (1 + 0.04)^2. Which is 1 + 2*(0.04) + (0.04)^2. So that's 1 + 0.08 + 0.0016 = 1.0816.\n\nSo now the equation is 54080 = P * 1.0816. To find P, I need to divide both sides by 1.0816. So P = 54080 / 1.0816.\n\nLet me calculate that. Hmm, 54080 divided by 1.0816. I'm not great at doing this in my head, so maybe I can approximate or find a way to compute it.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as 54080 divided by (1.0816). Let me see. Let's try dividing 54080 by 1.0816.\n\nWait, maybe I can write it as (54080 * 10000) / (10816) to eliminate decimals. Because 1.0816 is the same as 10816/10000.\n\nSo, 54080 * 10000 = 540,800,000. Divided by 10816.\n\nHmm, doing that division. Let me see how many times 10816 fits into 540800000.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find what 54080 / 1.0816 equals.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let's see: 1.0816 is approximately 1.08, so 54080 divided by 1.08 is about 50,000. Because 1.08 * 50,000 = 54,000. But 54,000 is less than 54,080. So the actual P should be a bit more than 50,000.\n\nWait, let's compute 50,000 * 1.0816 = 50,000 *1.0816. Let me calculate that. 50,000 *1 is 50,000. 50,000 *0.08 is 4,000. 50,000 *0.0016 is 80. So adding them up: 50,000 +4,000 is 54,000, plus 80 is 54,080. Oh wait, that's exactly the amount given! So 50,000 * 1.0816 equals 54,080. So P is 50,000. That's option B.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If P is 50,000, then after 8% semi-annual compounding for a year, it's two periods. Each period is 4%. So 50k becomes 50k *1.04 = 52k after 6 months, then 52k *1.04 = 54,080 after a year. Yep, that matches. So the initial investment is $50,000, which is option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Charles investing money, and I need to find out how much he originally invested. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nAlright, the question says that after one year, Charles received $54,080, which includes both the principal and the interest. The investment has an annual interest rate of 8 percent, but it's compounded semi-annually. Hmm, I remember that compound interest means the interest is calculated and added to the principal more than once a year. Since it's semi-annual, that's twice a year.\n\nWait, right, the formula for compound interest is A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt), where:\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nIn this case, the time t is 1 year, the rate r is 8%, so that's 0.08 as a decimal. The compounding is semi-annual, so n would be 2. And the amount A is $54,080. I need to find P.\n\nSo plugging the numbers into the formula: 54080 = P * (1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Charles's investment. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details. \n\nAlright, Charles invested some money for a year, and at the end, he received $54,080. This includes both the principal and the interest. The investment pays an annual interest rate of 8 percent, but it's compounded semi-annually. I need to find out how much he originally invested. The options are A) $45,000, B) $50,000, C) $54,000, D) $59,000, E) $62,000.\n\nHmm, okay. So, compound interest, right? I remember that compound interest means that the interest is calculated multiple times over the investment period, and each time it's calculated, it's added to the principal. Since it's compounded semi-annually, the interest is added twice a year.\n\nThe formula for compound interest is A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt), where:\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nIn this problem, the interest rate is 8%, so r would be 0.08. It's compounded semi-annually, so n is 2. The time t is 1 year. And A is $54,080.\n\nWait, but we're looking for P here. So I need to rearrange the formula to solve for P. Let me write that out. \n\nP = A / ( (1 + r/n)^(nt) )\n\nPlugging in the numbers: \nr is 0.08, n is 2, t is 1.\n\nSo first, calculate r/n: 0.08 divided by 2 is 0.04. Then, nt is 2 times 1, which is 2. So the denominator becomes (1 + 0.04)^2.\n\nLet me compute that. 1 + 0.04 is 1.04. Squared, that's 1.04 * 1.04. Hmm, what's 1.04 squared? Let me think. 1.04 times 1.04: 1*1 is 1, 1*0.04 is 0.04, 0.04*1 is another 0.04, and 0.04*0.04 is 0.0016. Adding them up: 1 + 0.04 + 0.04 + 0.0016 = 1.0816. So the denominator is 1.0816.\n\nSo P is 54,080 divided by 1.0816. Let me calculate that.\n\nHmm, 54,080 divided by 1.0816. I can do this division step by step.

Let's see: 50,000 * 1.0816 is 54,080. Oh, wait! That's exactly the amount he received. So P must be 50,000 because 50,000 multiplied by 1.0816 gives 54,080.\n\nWait, let me verify that. 50,000 * 1.0816. 50,000 times 1 is 50,000. 50,000 times 0.08 is 4,000, so 54,000. Then 50,000 times 0.0016 is 80. So 50,000 * 1.0816 = 50,000 + (50,000 *0.08) + (50,000 *0.0016) = 50,000 +4,000 +80=54,080. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the principal P is $50,000, which is option B. Let me just check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A is 45,000. Let's see what that would give: 45,000 * 1.0816. 45,000 * 1 is 45,000. 45,000 *0.08 is 3,600. 45,000 *0.0016 is 72. So total is 45,000 +3,600 +72=48,672. That's less than 54,080, so not the right answer.\n\nOption C is 54,000. That would be 54,000 *1.0816=58,382.4, which is more than 54,080. So that's not the answer.\n\nOption D is 59,000. 59,000 *1.0816 is way higher, around 63,838.4. No. Option E is 62,000, which would be even higher. So no, the correct answer must be option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Charles's investment. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details. \n\nAlright, Charles invested some money for a year, and at the end, he received $54,080. This includes both the principal and the interest. The investment pays an annual interest rate of 8 percent, but it's compounded semi-annually. I need to find out how much he originally invested. The options are A) $45,000, B) $50,000, C) $54,000, D) $59,000, E) $62,000.\n\nHmm, okay. So, compound interest, right? I remember that compound interest means that the interest is calculated multiple times over the investment period, and each time it's calculated, it's added to the principal. Since it's compounded semi-annually, the interest is added twice a year.\n\nThe formula for compound interest is A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt), where:\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nIn this problem, the interest rate is 8%, so r would be 0.08. It's compounded semi-annually, so n is 2. The time t is 1 year. And A is $54,080.\n\nWait, but we're looking for P here. So I need to rearrange the formula to solve for P. Let me write that out. \n\nP = A / ( (1 + r/n)^(nt) )\n\nPlugging in the numbers: \nr is 0.08, n is 2, t is 1.\n\nSo first, calculate r/n: 0.08 divided by 2 is 0.04. Then, nt is 2 times 1, which is 2. So the denominator becomes (1 + 0.04)^2.\n\nLet me compute that. 1 + 0.04 is 1.04. Squared, that's 1.04 * 1.04. Hmm, what's 1.04 squared? Let me think. 1.04 times 1.04: 1*1 is 1, 1*0.04 is 0.04, 0.04*1 is another 0.04, and 0.04*0.04 is 0.0016. Adding them up: 1 + 0.04 + 0.04 + 0.0016 = 1.0816. So the denominator is 1.0816.\n\nSo P is 54,080 divided by 1.0816. Let me calculate that.\n\nHmm, 54,080 divided by 1.0816. I can do this division step by step.

The investment had an annual interest rate of 8 percent, but it's compounded semi-annually. I need to find out how much he originally invested.\n\nWait, I remember that compound interest formulas are a bit different from simple interest. Oh right, the formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount after time t, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n\nSo, in this case, the annual rate is 8%, so r is 0.08.

Let me write it out as 54080 / 1.0816. Maybe I can simplify this. Let's see: 1.0816 is 10816/10000, so 54080 divided by (10816/10000) is the same as 54080 * (10000/10816).

Hmm, so Charles invested some money a year ago, and now at the end of the year, he received $54,080 which includes both the principal and the interest. The investment has an annual interest rate of 8%, but it's compounded semi-annually. Oh right, compounded semi-annually means that the interest is calculated and added twice a year, right?\n\nWait, so the formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nIn this case, the time t is 1 year. The rate r is 8%, so that's 0.08. Since it's compounded semi-annually, n would be 2. So the formula becomes A = P*(1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1). Simplifying that, 0.08 divided by 2 is 0.04, so it's (1.04)^2. Let me calculate that: 1.04 squared is 1.0816.\n\nSo the amount A after one year would be P multiplied by 1.0816. But we know that A is $54,080. So we can set up the equation 54,080 = P * 1.0816. To find P, we need to divide both sides by 1.0816.\n\nLet me compute that. 54,080 divided by 1.0816. Hmm, let's see. Maybe I can calculate this step by step. Alternatively, I can rearrange the formula as P = A / (1 + r/n)^(nt). Plugging in the numbers, P = 54,080 / (1.04)^2. Since (1.04)^2 is 1.0816, so 54,080 / 1.0816.\n\nLet me do this division. Hmm, 54,080 divided by 1.0816. Let me approximate this. 1.0816 is approximately 1.08, so 54,080 / 1.08 is about 50,074.07. But wait, let me check with the exact numbers. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as 54,080 divided by 1.0816. Let me compute this. Let's see: 54,080 \u00f7 1.0816. Let me set it up as a division problem.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute 54,080 / 1.0816 by rearranging. Let me multiply numerator and denominator by 10,000 to eliminate decimals. So that would be 54,080 * 10,000 / (1.0816 * 10,000) = 540,800,000 / 10,816. Now, let's compute that division.\n\nHmm, 10,816 * 50,000 would be 10,816 *5*10,000=54,080*10,000=540,800,000. Wait, wait a minute, that's exactly the numerator. So 540,800,000 divided by 10,816 equals 50,000. Oh wait, that can't be right because 10,816 *50,000 is 540,800,000. So that makes sense. So the principal P is $50,000.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is $50,000. So that's the answer. \n\nWait, let me double-check.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Charles and his investment. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, so Charles invested some money a year ago, and now at the end of the year, he received $54,080 which includes both the principal and the interest. The investment has an annual interest rate of 8%, but it's compounded semi-annually. Oh right, compounded semi-annually means that the interest is calculated and added twice a year, right?\n\nWait, so the formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nIn this case, the time t is 1 year. The rate r is 8%, so that's 0.08. Since it's compounded semi-annually, n would be 2. So the formula becomes A = P*(1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1). Simplifying that, 0.08 divided by 2 is 0.04, so it's (1.04)^2. Let me calculate that: 1.04 squared is 1.0816.\n\nSo the amount A after one year would be P multiplied by 1.0816. But we know that A is $54,080. So we can set up the equation 54,080 = P * 1.0816. To find P, we need to divide both sides by 1.0816.\n\nLet me compute that. 54,080 divided by 1.0816. Hmm, let's see. Maybe I can calculate this step by step. Alternatively, I can rearrange the formula as P = A / (1 + r/n)^(nt). Plugging in the numbers, P = 54,080 / (1.04)^2. Since (1.04)^2 is 1.0816, so 54,080 / 1.0816.\n\nLet me do this division. Hmm, 54,080 divided by 1.0816. Let me approximate this. 1.0816 is approximately 1.08, so 54,080 / 1.08 is about 50,074.07. But wait, let me check with the exact numbers. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as 54,080 divided by 1.0816. Let me compute this. Let's see: 54,080 \u00f7 1.0816. Let me set it up as a division problem.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute 54,080 / 1.0816 by rearranging. Let me multiply numerator and denominator by 10,000 to eliminate decimals. So that would be 54,080 * 10,000 / (1.0816 * 10,000) = 540,800,000 / 10,816. Now, let's compute that division.\n\nHmm, 10,816 * 50,000 would be 10,816 *5*10,000=54,080*10,000=540,800,000. Wait, wait a minute, that's exactly the numerator. So 540,800,000 divided by 10,816 equals 50,000. Oh wait, that can't be right because 10,816 *50,000 is 540,800,000. So that makes sense. So the principal P is $50,000.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is $50,000. So that's the answer. \n\nWait, let me double-check. If he invested $50,000 at 8% compounded semi-annually for a year, the interest would be calculated twice. Each period would be 4% interest. \n\nFirst six months: 50,000 * 0.04 = 2,000. So the amount after six months is 52,000. Second six months: 52,000 * 0.04 = 2,080. So total after a year is 54,080. Which matches the given amount. So yes, the original investment was $50,000.\n\n\nTo determine the original investment amount, we use the compound interest formula:\n\n\\[\nA = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(A = 54,080\\) (the total amount after one year),\n- \\(r = 0.08\\) (annual interest rate),\n- \\(n = 2\\) (compounded semi-annually),\n- \\(t = 1\\) (time in years),\n- \\(P\\) is the principal amount (the original investment).\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for \\(P\\):\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{A}{\\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{54,080}{\\left(1 + \\frac{0.08}{2}\\right)^{2 \\cdot 1}}\n\\]\n\nSimplify \\(\\frac{0.08}{2} = 0.04\\), so:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{54,080}{(1.04)^2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\((1.04)^2 = 1.0816\\), the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{54,080}{1.0816}\n\\]\n\nPerforming the division:\n\n\\[\nP = 50,000\n\\]\n\nTo verify, if Charles invested $50,000 at 8% compounded semi-annually:\n- After the first 6 months: \\(50,000 \\times 1.04 = 52,000\\),\n- After the second 6 months: \\(52,000 \\times 1.04 = 54,080\\).\n\nThis matches the given total amount, confirming that the original investment was $50,000.\n\nAnswer: B",

Let me think through this step by step.\n\nThe question says that Charles received $54,080 after one year, which includes both the principal and the interest. The investment has an annual interest rate of 8 percent, but it's compounded semi-annually. Hmm, right, compound interest. I remember the formula for compound interest is something like A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount after time t, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times it's compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n\nSo in this case, the rate is 8%, which is 0.08 as a decimal. It's compounded semi-annually, so n is 2. The time is 1 year, so t=1. The amount A is $54,080, and I need to find P, the principal.\n\nPlugging the numbers into the formula: 54080 = P*(1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1). Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 0.08 divided by 2 is 0.04. So each compounding period gives 4% interest. Then, 2*1 is 2, so the exponent is 2. So the equation becomes 54080 = P*(1.04)^2.\n\nWhat's 1.04 squared? Let me calculate. 1.04 * 1.04 equals... 1.0816. So 1.04 squared is 1.0816.\n\nSo now the equation is 54080 = P * 1.0816. To find P, I need to divide both sides by 1.0816.\n\nP = 54080 / 1.0816. Let me compute that. Hmm, doing this division... Well, 54080 divided by 1.0816.\n\nWait, maybe I can compute this step by step. Let me see, 54080 divided by 1.0816. Let me think about how this can be done.\n\nAlternatively, I can approximate this. I know that 1.0816 is approximately 1.08, but maybe it's better to do it more accurately.\n\nWait, maybe I can factor this.

Let me compute 1/1.0816.\n\nWait, 1.0816 is 108.16% of the principal. So the reciprocal is 1/1.0816. Let me compute that.\n\nHmm, 1 divided by 1.0816. Let me calculate:\n\n1.0816 * 0.925 = let's see. 1.0816 * 0.9 is 0.97344, and 1.0816 * 0.025 is about 0.02704. Adding them gives about 0.97344 + 0.02704 = 1.00048. Oh, that's close to 1. So 1.0816 * 0.925 \u2248 1. So 1/1.0816 \u2248 0.925.\n\nSo P \u2248 54080 * 0.925. Let's compute that.\n\n54080 * 0.925. Breaking it down: 54080 * 0.9 is 48672. 54080 * 0.025 is 1352. So 48672 + 1352 = 499, 48672 +1352 is 499, wait, 48672 + 1352 is 499, no wait, 48672 + 1352 is 499, but 48672 +1352 is 499, but wait:\n\nWait, 48672 + 1352: 48672 + 1000 =49672, plus 352 is 49672 + 352 = 50024. So that would make P approximately $50,024.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is $50,000. That's pretty close. Hmm, but maybe I should compute it more accurately.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute 54080 / 1.0816 without approximations.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet me set up the division: 54080 \u00f7 1.0816.\n\nFirst, I can write both numbers multiplied by 10,000 to eliminate the decimal. So 54080 * 10,000 is 540800000, and 1.0816 * 10,000 is 10816. So the division becomes 540800000 \u00f7 10816.\n\nHmm, that's still a big number. Maybe I can simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 16.\n\n540800000 \u00f716 is 33,800,000. 10816 \u00f716 is 676.\n\nSo now it's 33,800,000 \u00f7 676.\n\nLet me see what 676 \u00d7 50,000 is. 676 * 50,000 = 33,800,000. Oh, wait! So 676 * 50,000 = 33,800,000. So that means 50,000 is the answer.\n\nSo P is exactly $50,000. So the correct option is B.\n",
