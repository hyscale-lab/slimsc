      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says: A two-digit number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. Also, the digit in the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place. I need to find what the number is, and the options are A)12, B)24, C)42, D)48, E)49.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. First, I'll represent the two-digit number. Since it's a two-digit number, I can write it as 10*a + b, where 'a' is the digit in the ten's place and 'b' is the digit in the unit's place. So, for example, if the number is 34, a is 3 and b is 4, making it 10*3 +4 =34.\n\nNow, the problem states two conditions. Let's list them out.\n\n1. The number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. So, the number (which is 10a + b) minus the sum of its digits (a + b) equals 18. That gives me the equation: (10a + b) - (a + b) = 18.\n\n2. The unit's digit (b) is double the ten's digit (a). So, b = 2a.\n\nOkay, let's tackle the first condition. I'll write out the equation:\n\n(10a + b) - (a + b) = 18.\n\nSimplify that. Let's do the subtraction. 10a + b -a -b = 9a. So, 9a = 18. Dividing both sides by 9, I get a = 2.\n\nSo the ten's digit a is 2. Now, using the second condition, b is double a. So b = 2*2 =4. So the number should be 10a +b =10*2 +4=24.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the options. Option B is 24. But wait, let me check if this fits the first condition.\n\nThe number is 24. Sum of digits is 2+4=6. 24 exceeds 6 by 18? 24-6=18. Yes, that's correct. So 24 fits both conditions.\n\nBut wait, let me check the other options just to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Maybe I missed something.\n\nOption A is 12. Let's see. a=1, b=2. Sum is 3. 12-3=9. Not 18. So no.\n\nOption C is 42. a=4, b=2. Wait, but according to condition 2, b should be double a. So 2=2*4? No, 4*2 is 8. So b can't be 2. So C doesn't fit condition 2.\n\nOption D is 48. a=4, b=8. Does b=2a? 8=2*4 \u2192 yes. Now check condition 1. Number is 48, sum is 4+8=12. 48-12=36. Which is not 18. So condition 1 fails. So D is out.\n\nOption E is 49. a=4, b=9. b=2a \u2192 9=8? No, so condition 2 fails.\n\nSo the only number that satisfies both conditions is 24, which is option B.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated, I thought the answer was 24, but let me double-check. Because sometimes these problems can have multiple numbers fitting, but in this case, I think 24 is the only one.\n\nWait, another thought: when I solved 9a=18, a=2. So a is 2, b=4. So the number is 24. That's correct.\n\nBut wait, the options also include 42, which is option C. Let me see why that's an option. Because 42 has a=4 and b=2, but according to condition 2, b should be double a. So 2 would have to be double of 4, which is 8. No, that's not possible. So C doesn't fit.\n\nSo I think 24 is the correct answer. But let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.\n\nWait, another approach: let me list all the possible two-digit numbers where the unit digit is double the ten's digit.\n\nPossible two-digit numbers where b=2a.\n\na can be from 1 to 4, because if a is 5, b=10, which isn't a single digit. So possible a's are 1,2,3,4.\n\nSo possible numbers:\n\na=1 \u2192 b=2 \u2192 12.\n\na=2 \u2192 b=4 \u219224.\n\na=3\u2192b=6\u219236.\n\na=4\u2192b=8\u219248.\n\nSo the possible numbers are 12,24,36,48.\n\nNow, check which of these numbers exceeds the sum of its digits by 18.\n\nLet's check each:\n\n12: sum is 1+2=3. 12-3=9 \u2192 not 18. So no.\n\n24: sum is 6. 24-6=18 \u2192 yes.\n\n36: sum is 3+6=9. 36-9=27 \u2192 no.\n\n48: sum is 4+8=12. 48-12=36 \u2192 no.\n\nSo only 24 meets both conditions. So the answer is option B.\n",

First, the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. So, if the number is N, and the sum of its digits is S, then N = S +18. Got that. Second condition: the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place. So, if the tens digit is x, the units digit must be 2x.\n\nLet me break this down. Let's denote the tens digit as x and the units digit as y. From the second condition, y = 2x. So the number itself would be 10x + y, which is 10x + 2x =12x. \n\nNow, the sum of the digits is x + y, which is x + 2x = 3x. According to the first condition, the number exceeds this sum by 18.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve. Let me read it again and think through it step by step. The problem is about a two-digit number that has two specific properties: it's 18 more than the sum of its digits, and the unit's digit is double the ten's digit. I need to find which option fits both conditions.\n\nAlright, let me break it down. First, I'll consider what a two-digit number represents. A two-digit number can be expressed as 10*a + b, where 'a' is the digit in the ten's place and 'b' is the digit in the unit's place. So, the number itself is 10a + b.\n\nThe first condition says the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. So, the sum of the digits is a + b. The number (10a + b) is 18 more than this sum. That gives me an equation: 10a + b = (a + b) + 18.\n\nLet me write that down: 10a + b = a + b + 18.\n\nHmm, simplifying this equation. Subtract (a + b) from both sides. That would be 10a + b - a - b = 18. So, 9a = 18. Then, dividing both sides by 9 gives a = 2. So, the ten's digit is 2.\n\nThe second condition says the unit's digit is double the ten's digit. So, b = 2 * a. Since I found a is 2, then b = 4.\n\nSo putting it together, the number is 10a + b = 10*2 +4 = 24.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve. Let me read it again and think through it step by step. The problem is about a two-digit number that has two specific properties: it's 18 more than the sum of its digits, and the unit's digit is double the ten's digit. I need to find which option fits both conditions.\n\nAlright, let me break it down. First, I'll consider what a two-digit number represents. A two-digit number can be expressed as 10*a + b, where 'a' is the digit in the ten's place and 'b' is the digit in the unit's place. So, the number itself is 10a + b.\n\nThe first condition says the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. So, the sum of the digits is a + b. The number (10a + b) is 18 more than this sum. That gives me an equation: 10a + b = (a + b) + 18.\n\nLet me write that down: 10a + b = a + b + 18.\n\nHmm, simplifying this equation. Subtract (a + b) from both sides. That would be 10a + b - a - b = 18. So, 9a = 18. Then, dividing both sides by 9 gives a = 2. So, the ten's digit is 2.\n\nThe second condition says the unit's digit is double the ten's digit. So, b = 2 * a. Since I found a is 2, then b = 4.\n\nSo putting it together, the number is 10a + b = 10*2 +4 = 24. So, the number is 24, which is option B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the options. The options are A)12, B)24, C)42, D)48, E)49.\n\nWait, but let's verify if 24 meets both conditions.

Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: A two-digit number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. Also, the digit in the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place. I need to find the number from the given options.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. I think I should start by representing the two-digit number in terms of its digits. So, any two-digit number can be written as 10 times the ten's digit plus the unit's digit. Let's denote the ten's digit as 'x' and the unit's digit as 'y'. So the number is 10x + y.\n\nNow, the problem states that the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. The sum of the digits is x + y. So the number is equal to (x + y) + 18. Wait, no. Let me think again. It says the number exceeds the sum by 18, which means the number is 18 more than the sum. So mathematically, that would be:\n\n10x + y = (x + y) + 18.\n\nSimplifying that equation: 10x + y = x + y + 18. If I subtract x and y from both sides, I get 9x = 18. So x = 2. Oh, so the ten's digit is 2.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Subtract x and y from both sides: 10x + y - x - y = 18 \u2192 9x = 18 \u2192 x=2. Yes, that's right.\n\nThe next condition is that the unit's digit is double the ten's digit. So y = 2x. Since x is 2, y would be 4. So the number should be 10*2 +4=24. Let me check the options. Option B is 24. So is that the answer? Wait, but wait, let me make sure.\n\nWait, let's verify the first condition. The number is 24. Sum of digits is 2+4=6. The number exceeds this sum by 18? 24 -6=18. Yes, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because another option is 48. Let me think: If the ten's digit is 4, then the unit's digit would be 8 (since 8=2*4). The number would be 48. Sum of digits is 12. 48 -12=36, which is not 18. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but wait, in my initial calculation, I found x=2, so the number is 24. But why is option C 42 also an option? Let me see. If the number were 42, the sum is 4+2=6. 42-6=36, which is not 18. So 42 doesn't fit.\n\nWait another thought: Did I make a mistake in setting up the equation? Let me double-check. The number is 10x + y. Sum of digits is x + y. The number exceeds the sum by 18: 10x + y = (x + y) + 18. That's correct.\n\nSo 9x=18 \u2192 x=2. So the ten's digit is 2, unit's digit is 4. So number is 24, which is option B. But wait, the options include 48 and 42. Let me see if I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another approach. Let's list all two-digit numbers where the unit digit is double the ten's digit. Let's see:\n\nx can be from 1 to 9 (since it's a two-digit number), and y = 2x. But y can't exceed 9, so x can be up to 4 because 2*5=10 which is not a single digit. So possible x values are 1,2,3,4.\n\nSo possible numbers are:\n\nx=1 \u2192 y=2 \u2192 12\n\nx=2 \u2192 y=4 \u219224\n\nx=3 \u2192 y=6 \u219236\n\nx=4 \u2192 y=8 \u219248\n\nSo these are the possible numbers: 12,24,36,48.\n\nNow, let's check each of these against the first condition: number = sum of digits +18.\n\n12: sum is 1+2=3. 12-3=9. Not 18.\n\n24: sum is 6. 24-6=18. Yes.\n\n36: sum is 9. 36-9=27. Not 18.\n\n48: sum is 12. 48-12=36. Not 18.\n\nSo only 24 fits.

So, the equation would be:\n\n(10x + y) - (x + y) = 18\n\nLet me simplify that. 10x + y - x - y = 18. The y terms cancel out, so 9x = 18. Then, x equals 18 divided by 9, which is 2.

So, the equation would be:\n\n(10x + y) - (x + y) = 18\n\nLet me simplify that. 10x + y - x - y = 18. The y terms cancel out, so 9x = 18. Then, x equals 18 divided by 9, which is 2. So x is 2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the tens digit is 2. That's one condition done. Now, the second condition says the unit's digit is double the ten's digit. So y = 2x. Since x is 2, y would be 4.\n\nSo putting it together, the number is 10x + y = 10*2 +4 = 24. So the number is 24. Looking at the options, B is 24. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's verify both conditions.\n\nFirst condition: The number is 24, sum of digits is 2+4=6. 24 -6=18. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSecond condition: Unit's digit is 4, ten's digit is 2. 4 is double of 2. Also correct.\n\nSo yes, 24 is the right answer. But wait, let me check the other options just in case.\n\nOption C is 42. Let's see. Sum is 4+2=6. 42-6=36, which is way more than 18. So that doesn't fit.\n\nOption D is 48. Sum is 4+8=12. 48-12=36, again not 18. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption E is 49. Sum is 4+9=13. 49-13=36. Also not 18.\n\nOption A is 12. Sum is 1+2=3. 12-3=9, which is less than 18. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo yes, only option B fits both conditions. So the answer must be B)24.\n\n\nLet the two-digit number be represented as \\(10x + y\\), where \\(x\\) is the tens digit and \\(y\\) is the units digit. The problem states two conditions:\n\n1. The number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18:\n   \\[\n   (10x + y) - (x + y) = 18\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   9x = 18 \\implies x = 2\n   \\]\n\n2. The units digit is double the tens digit:\n   \\[\n   y = 2x\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(x = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   y = 4\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number is \\(10x + y = 10(2) + 4 = 24\\).\n\nVerifying the conditions:\n- Sum of digits: \\(2 + 4 = 6\\). The number minus the sum: \\(24 - 6 = 18\\), which satisfies the first condition.\n- Units digit: \\(4 = 2 \\times 2\\), which satisfies the second condition.\n\nChecking the other options confirms they do not satisfy both conditions. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: B",

Let me write that as an equation.\n\nNumber = 10a + b\nSum of digits = a + b\nSo, 10a + b = (a + b) + 18.\n\nWait, that makes sense because the number is 18 more than the sum of its digits.

But wait, let me make sure I did that correctly. Let's see: 10a + b - (a + b) = 18 \u2192 9a = 18 \u2192 a=2. Yep, that's correct.\n\nThe second condition is that the digit in the unit's place (b) is double the digit in the ten's place (a). So, b = 2*a.\n\nSince a is 2, then b must be 4. Because 2 * 2 is 4.\n\nSo the number is 10a + b = 10*2 +4 = 24. Hmm, but wait, looking at the options, B is 24, but I see another option, C is 42.

But according to the second condition, b should be double a. 2 is not double of 4. So that's not possible. So 42 can't be the answer.\n\nWait, but why is 42 an option? Maybe I made a mistake in the way I set up the problem. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the problem says the digit at the unit's place is double the ten's place. So, if a is the ten's digit, then b=2a.\n\nIn the first condition, 10a + b = (a + b) +18.\n\nSo, substituting b=2a into the first equation:\n\n10a + 2a = (a + 2a) +18 \u2192 12a = 3a +18 \u2192 12a -3a =18 \u2192 9a=18 \u2192 a=2.

But wait, could I have mixed up a and b?\n\nWait, another way: perhaps the problem is written as the digit in the unit's place is double the ten's place. So if the number is 42, then unit's digit is 2, which would have to be double the ten's digit 4. But 2 is not double of 4. So 42 doesn't satisfy the condition. So 24 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. Let me see the options: 24 is option B. So why is 42 an option? Maybe the problem is in the way the conditions are set up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation. Let me go back.\n\nThe first condition: the number exceeds the sum by 18. So number = sum +18.\n\nSo, 10a + b = (a + b) +18 \u2192 10a +b -a -b =18 \u2192 9a=18 \u2192 a=2. Correct.\n\nThen, since b=2a, that's 4.

Did I misinterpret the condition?\n\nThe problem says the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place. So unit's digit = 2 * ten's digit. So for 24, 4=2*2, correct.\n\nIn 42, 2 is the unit's digit, ten's is 4. 2 is not 2*4. So 42 doesn't fit.\n\nSo why is option C 42 there? Maybe a trick?

The number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18.  \n2. The digit in the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place.  \n\nLet the two-digit number be represented as \\(10a + b\\), where \\(a\\) is the ten's digit and \\(b\\) is the unit's digit.  \n\n### Step 1: Translate the conditions into equations  \n- From the first condition:  \n  \\[\n  10a + b = (a + b) + 18 \\implies 9a = 18 \\implies a = 2.\n  \\]  \n- From the second condition:  \n  \\[\n  b = 2a.\n  \\]  \n\n### Step 2: Solve for \\(b\\)  \nSubstituting \\(a = 2\\) into \\(b = 2a\\):  \n\\[\nb = 2 \\times 2 = 4.\n\\]  \n\nThus, the number is \\(10a + b = 10 \\times 2 + 4 = 24\\).  \n\n### Step 3: Verify the answer  \n- For \\(24\\):  \n  - Sum of digits: \\(2 + 4 = 6\\).  \n  - \\(24 - 6 = 18\\), which satisfies the first condition.  \n  - Unit's digit (\\(4\\)) is double the ten's digit (\\(2\\)), which satisfies the second condition.  \n\n### Step 4: Check other options  \n- **Option A (12):** Sum of digits is \\(1 + 2 = 3\\), and \\(12 - 3 = 9 \\neq 18\\).  \n- **Option C (42):** Sum of digits is \\(4 + 2 = 6\\), and \\(42 - 6 = 36 \\neq 18\\).  \n- **Option D (48):** Sum of digits is \\(4 + 8 = 12\\), and \\(48 - 12 = 36 \\neq 18\\).  \n- **Option E (49):** Sum of digits is \\(4 + 9 = 13\\), and \\(49 - 13 = 36 \\neq 18\\).  \n\nNone of the other options satisfy both conditions.  \n\n### Final Answer  \nThe number is \\(24\\), which corresponds to **Option B**.  \n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says it's a two-digit number. Hmm, two-digit numbers are from 10 to 99, right?\n\nThe problem states two main things. First, the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. Wait, that means if the number is, say, AB (where A is the tens digit and B is the units digit), then the number itself is 10*A + B. The sum of its digits is A + B. So the condition is that 10*A + B = (A + B) + 18. Oh, because the number is 18 more than the sum of the digits.\n\nLet me write that equation down. 10A + B = (A + B) + 18. Simplify that: 10A + B - A - B = 18 \u2192 9A = 18 \u2192 A = 2. Oh, so the tens digit is 2. That's interesting.\n\nWait, but there's another condition. The digit in the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place. So B = 2*A. Since we found A is 2, then B would be 4. So the number is 24, right? Wait, let me check the options. Option B is 24. So that's one possibility.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through the steps again. The number is 24. Sum of digits is 2 + 4 =6. The number itself is 24. Does 24 exceed 6 by 18? 6 + 18 is 24, yes. So that fits.\n\nBut wait, I have another thought. What if the tens digit A isn't 2? Let me think again. The equation was 9A =18, which gives A=2. So that's the only possibility for A. So the only possible number is 24. But wait, looking at the options, option D is 48. Let me check that. Let's see: 48. Sum of digits is 4+8=12. 48 -12 =36. But the problem says the number exceeds the sum by 18, not 36. So 48 wouldn't fit. So 24 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another option just to be thorough. Let's try option C, which is 42. Sum of digits is 4+2=6. 42-6=36. No, that's not 18. So no. Option A is 12: sum is 3. 12-3=9, not 18. Option E is 49: sum is 13. 49-13=36. Not 18. So only option B fits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me read it again. The number exceeds the sum by 18. So number = sum +18. So 10A + B = (A + B) + 18 \u2192 9A =18 \u2192 A=2. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the number is 24, which is option B.\n",
