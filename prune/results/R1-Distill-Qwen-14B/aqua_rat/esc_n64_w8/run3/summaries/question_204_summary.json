      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out what 60% of 30% of 1400 grams is. Hmm, percentages can be a bit tricky, but let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that \"of\" in math problems usually means multiplication. So, 30% of 1400 grams would be 30% multiplied by 1400. Then, I take 60% of that result. So it's like two steps: first find 30% of 1400, then find 60% of that number.\n\nLet me start with the first part. 30% is the same as 0.3 in decimal form. So I multiply 0.3 by 1400 grams. Let's see, 0.3 times 1400. Hmm, 1400 divided by 10 is 140, so 0.1 times 1400 is 140. So 0.3 is three times that, which would be 420 grams. Wait, is that right? Because 0.3 * 1400 is 420 grams. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nNow the second part: 60% of that 420 grams. So again, 60% is 0.6. Multiply 0.6 by 420. Let me calculate that. 420 times 0.6. Hmm, 420 times 0.6 is the same as 420 * (3/5) because 0.6 is 3/5. So 420 divided by 5 is 84. Then, 84 multiplied by 3 is 252. So 0.6 times 420 is 252 grams.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Alternatively, I can do 420 * 0.6. 400 *0.6 is 240, and 20*0.6 is 12, so 240+12=252. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo putting it all together: 60% of 30% of 1400 grams is 252 grams. Now looking at the options, option C is 252 grams. So the answer should be C.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me go through each step again.\n\n30% of 1400: 0.3 * 1400 = 420. Correct. Then 60% of 420: 0.6 * 420 = 252. Correct. So yes, 252 grams is the right answer.\n\nSo the answer is option C.\n",

That makes sense because it's like taking a percentage of a percentage.\n\nWait, wait. So the first part is 30% of 1400 grams. How do I calculate that? Oh right, percentage means per hundred. So 30% is the same as 30 per hundred, or 0.3 in decimal form. So I multiply 1400 by 0.3. Let me do that calculation.\n\n1400 multiplied by 0.3. Let's see, 1400 times 0.1 is 140, so 0.3 is three times that. 140 times 3 is 420. So 30% of 1400 grams is 420 grams. Okay, got that down.\n\nNow, the next step is to find 60% of that 420 grams.

Hmm, percentages can sometimes be a bit tricky, but I think I can handle this.\n\nFirst, I remember that to find a percentage of a number, you convert the percentage to a decimal and then multiply it by the number. So, let me break it down. The problem has two percentages: 30% and 60%. I think I need to calculate each step one after the other.\n\nSo, starting with 30% of 1400 grams. How do I calculate that? Oh right, 30% is the same as 0.30 in decimal form. So I multiply 1400 by 0.30. Let me do that calculation: 1400 * 0.30. Wait, 1400 times 0.3 is 420. So 30% of 1400 grams is 420 grams.\n\nNow, the next part is finding 60% of that 420 grams. Again, converting 60% to a decimal gives me 0.60. So I multiply 420 by 0.60. Let me compute that. 420 times 0.6 is... 252. Because 400 *0.6 is 240, and 20*0.6 is 12, so adding them gives 252. So 60% of 420 grams is 252 grams.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 30% of 1400: 1400 * 0.3 is indeed 420. Then 60% of 420: 420 *0.6 equals 252. Yep, that seems right.\n\nNow looking at the options provided:\n\nA) 450 gms\nB) 100 gms\nC) 252 gms\nD) 240 gms\nE) None of these\n\nSo the correct answer should be C) 252 gms. Let me check the options again. Yes, option C is 252. So that's the one.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, first calculate 30% of 1400 grams. Converting 30% to a decimal gives 0.30, so:\n\n\\[\n1400 \\times 0.30 = 420 \\, \\text{grams}.\n\\]\n\nNext, calculate 60% of 420 grams. Converting 60% to a decimal gives 0.60, so:\n\n\\[\n420 \\times 0.60 = 252 \\, \\text{grams}.\n\\]\n\nThus, 60% of 30% of 1400 grams is 252 grams. Among the options, the correct answer is:\n\nC) 252 gms.\n\nAnswer: C",

Hmm, percentages can sometimes get a bit tricky, but I think I can handle this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break it down. The question is asking for 60% of 30% of 1400 grams. I think the way to approach this is to calculate each percentage one after the other. So, I'll start by finding 30% of 1400 grams because that's the inner part of the problem.\n\nWait, how do you calculate a percentage of a number again? Oh right, you convert the percentage to its decimal form and multiply. So 30% is 0.3 in decimal. So I'll multiply 1400 grams by 0.3 to get the first part.\n\nLet me do that calculation. 1400 * 0.3. Hmm, 1400 times 0.3. Well, 1400 times 0.1 is 140, so 0.3 would be three times that. 140 * 3 is 420. So 30% of 1400 grams is 420 grams. Okay, got that down.\n\nNow, the next part is finding 60% of that 420 grams. So again, I'll convert 60% to a decimal, which is 0.6, and multiply it by 420.\n\nLet me calculate 420 * 0.6. Hmm, 400 * 0.6 is 240, and 20 * 0.6 is 12. So 240 + 12 is 252. So 60% of 420 grams is 252 grams.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the order. The question says 60% of 30% of 1400. So yeah, I did 30% first, then took 60% of that result. That seems right.\n\nSo putting it all together: 30% of 1400 is 420, then 60% of 420 is 252 grams. So the answer should be 252 grams.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 252 grams. So that's the one I think is correct. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to be sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nWait another thought: Alternatively, I can calculate both percentages together.

Oh, same result. So that confirms it. So yeah, 252 grams is definitely the right answer.\n\nSo looking back at the options, option C is 252 grams. So that's the correct choice.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again: \"What is 60% of 30% of 1400 grams?\" Hmm, percentages can sometimes be tricky, but I think I can handle it.\n\nWait, percentages... right. So percentages are just parts per hundred. So 30% means 30 per 100, or 0.3 in decimal form. And 60% is 0.6. Oh, right, because you move the decimal two places to the left.\n\nSo the question is asking for 60% of (30% of 1400 grams). Let me break it down step by step. First, I should find out what 30% of 1400 grams is. Then, take 60% of that result.\n\nAlright, starting with 30% of 1400 grams. To calculate that, I can multiply 1400 by 0.3. Let me do that: 1400 * 0.3. Hmm, 1400 times 0.3 is... well, 1400 divided by 10 is 140, so 140 times 3 is 420. So 30% of 1400 is 420 grams.\n\nNow, the next step is to find 60% of that 420 grams. So again, I'll convert 60% to a decimal, which is 0.6. Multiply 420 by 0.6. Let me calculate that. 420 * 0.6 is the same as 420 multiplied by 6/10, which is 420 * 6 = 2520, then divided by 10, which gives 252. So 60% of 420 is 252 grams.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is 252 grams. So that should be the correct answer. But wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it all in one go. The problem is 60% of 30% of 1400. So mathematically, that's 0.6 * 0.3 * 1400. Let me compute that: 0.6 * 0.3 is 0.18. Then, 0.18 multiplied by 1400. Let's see, 1400 * 0.18. Hmm, 1400 * 0.1 is 140, and 1400 * 0.08 is 112. Adding those together: 140 + 112 = 252. Yep, same result. So that's correct.\n\nI think I've got it right. So the answer should be option C, 252 grams. But wait, looking at the options, option D is 240. Did I maybe miscalculate somewhere? Let me check again.\n\nWait, another approach: 30% of 1400 is 420. Then 60% of 420. Let me compute 420 * 0.6 again. 420 times 0.6 is 252. No, that's correct. So the answer is definitely 252 grams, which is option C.\n",
