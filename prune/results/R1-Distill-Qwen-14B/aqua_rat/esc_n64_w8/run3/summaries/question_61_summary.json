      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the total number of students in a class based on the percentages interested in different games and the number not interested in any.\n\nHmm, the problem says that 8% are interested in Football. Then, 4/5 (which is 80%) are interested in Cricket. 10% are into Basketball. And the remaining 20 students aren't interested in any. So, I think I need to add up all these percentages and subtract from 100% to find what percentage corresponds to the 20 students.\n\nWait, let me list out the given data:\n\n- Football: 8%\n- Cricket: 4/5 \u2192 which is 80%\n- Basketball: 10%\n- Not interested in any: 20 students.\n\nSo, let's add up the percentages: 8% + 80% +10% = 98%. That leaves 2% of the students not interested in any of the games. Oh wait, but the problem says 20 students are not interested. So, 2% of the total students equals 20.\n\nSo, mathematically, 2% of total = 20. Let me write that as an equation: 0.02 * T = 20, where T is total students. Solving for T, I can divide both sides by 0.02. 20 / 0.02 is 1000. So T would be 1000.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check the percentages. 8% football, 80% cricket, 10% basketball. So 8 + 80 is 88, plus 10 is 98. So 2% is the remaining. So yes, 2% corresponds to 20 students.\n\nSo T is 1000. Looking at the options, option E is 1000. So the answer should be E.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Are there any overlaps between the interests? Like, could some students be interested in more than one game? The problem doesn't specify, but I think in these kinds of problems, unless stated otherwise, we assume that the interests are mutually exclusive. Or wait, no, maybe not. Wait, actually, wait. If the interests are not mutually exclusive, then the percentages could overlap, which would complicate things. But the problem doesn't mention anything about overlaps, so I think the question is assuming that each student's interest is counted in each category without considering overlaps. Hmm, but wait, that can't be right because adding up the percentages would then exceed 100% in that case, but in this case, 98% plus 2% makes 100%, so maybe each student is counted only once in their interested category. So perhaps the 8%, 80%, and 10% are for different groups. Or maybe some students are interested in more than one but the percentages are of the total each. Hmm, but in the question, the way it's phrased is \"interested in Football\", \"interested in Cricket\", etc. So if a student is interested in both, they would be counted in both percentages. So the total number of students interested in at least one game would be less than or equal to the sum of the individual percentages. But in this problem, the way the question is set up, the 20 students are not interested in any. So the rest (98%) are interested in at least one game. But wait, the sum of the percentages is 98%, but if some are interested in more than one, the actual number of students interested in at least one could be less than 98% of T. But wait, the problem says 8% are interested in Football, 4/5 (80%) in Cricket, 10% in Basketball, and 2% (20 students) in none. So if the 8% and 80% and 10% all include overlaps, then the actual number of students interested in at least one would be less than 98% of T. But since the problem says the remaining 20 are not interested in any, implying that the 98% are all interested in at least one. Wait, that doesn't add up because 98% + 2% = 100%, but if the 98% includes overlaps, then the number of students in at least one could be less. But perhaps in the problem's setup, the percentages are of the total, but the 20 students are outside all of them.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem states that the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. So the total number of students interested in at least one game is T - 20. The sum of the percentages is 8% + 80% + 10% = 98%, which is 98% of T. So T -20 = 0.98 T \u2192 T - 0.98 T = 20 \u2192 0.02 T =20 \u2192 T=1000. So regardless of overlaps, the equation holds because the sum of the percentages is 98% of T, which equals the number of students interested in at least one game. So T=1000. So the answer is E.\n",

And the remaining 20 students aren't interested in any of these games. Hmm, I need to find the total number of students.\n\nWait, so I'm given percentages and fractions for some sports, and a fixed number for those who aren't interested. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nLet's denote the total number of students as T. That might make it easier to write equations. So, T is what we're trying to find.\n\nFor Football, 8% of T are interested. So that's 0.08 * T.\n\nCricket is 4/5 of T. 4/5 is the same as 0.8, so that's 0.8 * T.\n\nBasketball is 10% of T, which is 0.10 * T.\n\nAnd the rest, 20 students, are not interested in any. So, the sum of all the interested students plus these 20 should equal the total T.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Are there any overlaps? Like, are some students interested in more than one sport? The problem doesn't specify, so I think I can assume that each student's interests are separate. But wait, no, that might not be the case. Because the sum of the percentages might add up to more than 100%, implying some overlap. But since the problem doesn't mention overlaps, maybe I should consider that each student can be interested in multiple sports, but the problem is just giving the total numbers for each sport regardless of overlap. Hmm, but I think the problem is considering each sport's interested students, so the 20 students are those not interested in any, and the rest are interested in at least one. Wait, but maybe the sum of the percentages is more than 100%, which would complicate things. Let's check.\n\nLet me add up the percentages: 8% + 4/5 + 10%. Wait, 4/5 is 80%, right? So 8% + 80% is 88%, plus 10% is 98%. So 98% are interested in at least one sport, and 2% are not. But wait, the problem says the remaining 20 students are not interested in any. So 2% of T equals 20.\n\nWait, that would make sense. So 2% of T is 20. So 0.02 * T = 20. Then T would be 20 / 0.02 = 1000. So is the answer 1000? Let me check the options.\n\nOption E is 1000. So that would be the answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nWait, another way to look at it: the sum of the students interested in each sport is 8% + 80% + 10% = 98%. So 98% of T are interested in at least one sport, and the remaining 2% are not, which is 20 students. So 2% of T is 20. So T is 20 / 0.02 = 1000. Yep, that seems right.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm wrong in assuming that the percentages add up to 98%. Because in reality, some students might be interested in more than one sport, so the sum of the percentages would be higher than the actual percentage of students interested in at least one sport. But in this problem, since the question says \"interested in Football\", \"interested in Cricket\", and \"interested in Basketball\", without any mention of overlaps, maybe the way to approach it is that the sum of these is the number of students interested in any of them, but that's not necessarily correct because a student could be in multiple categories.\n\nWait, but the problem says the remaining 20 are not interested in any. So the sum of the interested in any of the sports would be T -20. So if I add up the students interested in each sport, that would be the sum of F + C + B = T -20. But if some students are interested in more than one sport, then F + C + B would be greater than T -20. But the problem doesn't give us any information about overlaps, so I can't account for that. So perhaps the intended approach is to assume that each student is only interested in one sport, or that the given percentages sum to T-20, which would imply 98% of T is T-20, leading to T=1000.\n\nWait, that's what I thought earlier. Let me do the math again. Let me write the equation:\n\nTotal students = students interested in Football + students interested in Cricket + students interested in Basketball + students not interested in any.\n\nWait no, that can't be right because some students might be in more than one sport, so that equation would overcount. Alternatively, the correct way is that:\n\nstudents interested in at least one sport = F + C + B - (students in F and C) - (students in F and B) - (students in C and B) + (students in all three).\n\nBut since the problem doesn't provide any information about overlaps, it's impossible to calculate it accurately.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about figuring out the total number of students in a class based on their interests in different sports. Hmm, let's see. I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says that 8% of the total students are interested in Football. Then, 4/5 are interested in Cricket. Oh wait, wait. Wait, 4/5 is a fraction, so that's like 80% because 4 divided by 5 is 0.8. Right, so 80% of the class likes Cricket. Then, 10% are into Basketball. Oh, and the remaining 20 students don't like any games. So I need to find the total number of students.\n\nLet me jot down the given data:\n\n- Football: 8%\n- Cricket: 4/5 \u2192 80%\n- Basketball: 10%\n- Not interested in any: 20 students\n\nSo, if I add up the percentages for Football, Cricket, and Basketball, that's 8 + 80 + 10, which equals 98%. Oh, so the remaining 2% must be the ones not interested in any games. Wait, because 100% - 98% = 2%. And that 2% equals 20 students. Oh, right! So I can set up an equation where 2% of the total students equals 20.\n\nLet me define the total number of students as T. So, 2% of T is 20. In math terms, that's 0.02 * T = 20. To find T, I can divide both sides by 0.02. So T = 20 / 0.02. Let me calculate that. 20 divided by 0.02 is the same as 20 multiplied by 50, because 1/0.02 is 50. So 20 * 50 is 1000. Wait, that would make T equal to 1000 students. But wait, looking at the options, E is 1000. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, let me double-check. So 2% of T is 20. So 0.02 T = 20. Yes. So T is 20 / 0.02, which is 1000. So the total number of students would be 1000. So the answer should be E.\n\nBut wait, let me go through the percentages again to be thorough. Football is 8%, Cricket is 80%, Basketball is 10%. 8 + 80 is 88, plus 10 is 98. So 98% are into at least one sport, and 2% are not. So 2% is 20 students. So 20 is 2% of the class. So 20 is 2% \u2192 1% is 10, so 100% is 1000. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but the options include 800, 900, etc. So why is 1000 an option? Because according to the calculation, it's correct. Maybe I should check the problem again. Let me read it again.\n\n\"In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games.\"\n\nWait, 4/5 is 80%, right.

I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says that 8% of the total students are interested in Football. Then, 4/5 are interested in Cricket. Oh wait, wait. Wait, 4/5 is a fraction, so that's like 80% because 4 divided by 5 is 0.8. Right, so 80% of the class likes Cricket. Then, 10% are into Basketball. Oh, and the remaining 20 students don't like any games.

Oh, so the remaining 2% must be the ones not interested in any games. Wait, because 100% - 98% = 2%. And that 2% equals 20 students. Oh, right! So I can set up an equation where 2% of the total students equals 20.\n\nLet me define the total number of students as T. So, 2% of T is 20. In math terms, that's 0.02 * T = 20.

Hmm, so the question is about finding the total number of students in a class based on their interests in different games and the number of students not interested in any.\n\nAlright, let's break down the information given. We've got four categories: Football, Cricket, Basketball, and none. The last one is 20 students not interested in any games.\n\nSo, the first step is to figure out what percentage of the class is accounted for by the students interested in each sport. Let's list them:\n\n- Football: 8% of total students.\n- Cricket: 4/5 of total students. Wait, 4/5 is the same as 80%, right? Because 4 divided by 5 is 0.8, which is 80%.\n- Basketball: 10% of total students.\n- None: 20 students, which is the remaining percentage.\n\nWait, wait. Let me make sure. The sum of all these percentages plus the 20 students should equal 100%, right? Because every student is either interested in one of the games or none.\n\nSo, let's add up the percentages of Football, Cricket, and Basketball.\n\nFootball is 8%, Cricket is 80%, Basketball is 10%. So adding those together: 8 + 80 = 88, plus 10 is 98%. Oh, so that leaves 2% unaccounted for. But wait, the problem says the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. So that 20 students must make up that 2%, right?\n\nWait, no. Wait, no. Let me think again. Because if 8% + 80% +10% = 98%, then the remaining 2% would be the students not interested in any. But the problem says that the remaining 20 students are not interested. So 2% equals 20 students. So that's the key.\n\nSo, if 2% equals 20 students, we can find the total number of students. Let's let the total number be 'x'. So 2% of x is 20.\n\nIn equation terms, that's 0.02 * x = 20. To find x, we can divide both sides by 0.02.\n\nSo x = 20 / 0.02. Let's compute that. 20 divided by 0.02. Well, 0.02 is 2 hundredths, so 20 divided by 0.02 is the same as 20 multiplied by 50, because 1/0.02 is 50. So 20 *50 is 1000. So x would be 1000 students.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the math. 0.02 * 1000 = 20, yes. That's correct.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 1000. So the answer should be E) 1000.\n\nWait a second, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in adding the percentages. So 8% (Football) + 80% (Cricket) +10% (Basketball) = 98%. So the remaining 2% is the 20 students. So 2% is 20, so 100% is 1000. That all adds up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think in terms of fractions. 4/5 is 80%, correct. Then 8% is football, 10% basketball. So 8 + 80 +10 = 98%. So yes, 2% is 20 students, so total is 1000.\n",

Let me add those up. 8 + 80 is 88, plus 10 makes 98. Oh, so the total percentage of students interested in at least one sport is 98%. That leaves 2% uninterested. Because 100 - 98 is 2.

Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details right.\n\nThe question is about finding the total number of students in a class based on their interests in different games and the number who aren't interested in any. Hmm, okay. Let's break it down.\n\nSo, the problem says that 8% of the total students are interested in Football. Then, 4/5 of the total are interested in Cricket. Oh wait, 4/5 is like 80%, right? Because 4 divided by 5 is 0.8, which is 80%. So 80% interested in cricket.\n\nNext, 10% of the total students are interested in Basketball. And then, there's a group of 20 students who aren't interested in any games. The question is, how many students are there in total?\n\nLet me think. So, the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, Basketball, plus the ones not interested in any should add up to 100% of the class, right?\n\nWait, but wait. The way it's phrased, each of these percentages is of the total students. So 8% for Football, 80% for Cricket, 10% for Basketball. But I should check if these are all separate or if some students might be interested in more than one game. The problem doesn't specify, but I think for this problem, we can assume that each percentage is independent, meaning that each student's interest is counted in each category. So, perhaps, the total percentage would be the sum of these, but if there's an overlap, that complicates things. However, since the problem doesn't mention overlapping, maybe it's safe to assume that these are separate groups. But wait, no, that's not the case because each student can be interested in multiple sports. So, in reality, the sum of these percentages might be more than 100%, but the problem doesn't give us that info. Hmm, this is a bit tricky.\n\nWait, but the problem says that 20 students are not interested in any games. So, the rest of the students are interested in at least one game. So, the sum of the percentages interested in Football, Cricket, Basketball plus the 20 students not interested equals 100% of the total.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. Let me denote the total number of students as T. Then, 8% of T is interested in Football, 80% in Cricket, 10% in Basketball. But the problem is, some students might be interested in more than one sport. So, the total number interested in at least one sport is not simply 8% + 80% + 10% because that would count students interested in multiple sports multiple times.\n\nBut the problem doesn't give any information about overlaps. So, perhaps the problem is assuming that these are distinct groups, meaning that each student is only interested in one sport. But that doesn't make sense because 8% + 80% + 10% is 98%, so 2% are not interested in any, but the problem says 20 students are not interested. So, maybe I can model it as the sum of these percentages equals 80% (Cricket) + 8% (Football) + 10% (Basketball) = 98%. So, the remaining 2% of T would be the ones not interested in any. But wait, the problem says 20 students are not interested, so 2% of T is 20. Let me check that.\n\nSo, 2% of T equals 20. So, T = 20 / 0.02. Let me calculate that. 20 divided by 0.02 is the same as 20 * 50, which is 1000. So T would be 1000. But wait, that's assuming that the 8% + 80% + 10% = 98%, and the remaining 2% are the 20 students. So, 2% is 20, so 1% is 10, so 100% is 1000. That would make T=1000.\n\nBut looking at the options, option E is 1000. So, that would be the answer, right?\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me see if that adds up. So, 8% of 1000 is 80 students interested in Football. 80% of 1000 is 800 in Cricket. 10% is 100 in Basketball. So, adding these up: 80 + 800 + 100 = 980 students interested in at least one sport. But wait, 1000 total students, 20 are not interested. So 980 are interested in at least one sport. But wait, that's 98% of the total, which matches the percentages given. So, the 2% is 20 students, which is correct.\n\nSo, the total number of students is 1000. So, the answer would be E) 1000.\n\nBut wait, another thought: perhaps the way the problem is phrased, each of the percentages is of the total, but some students are counted in more than one sport. For example, a student interested in both Football and Cricket would be counted in both percentages. So, the total number of students interested in at least one sport would be less than the sum of the percentages. But without knowing the overlaps, how can I compute this?\n\nHmm, that complicates things. Because if some students are counted in multiple sports, the sum of the percentages might be more than 100%, but the actual number of students interested in at least one sport would be less. But the problem says that 20 students are not interested in any, which implies that 100% - (sum of percentages) is the 20 students.\n\nWait, but that's only true if all the percentages are non-overlapping. Otherwise, the sum would be an overcount. So, maybe my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the percentages are independent and non-overlapping, which is a common assumption in such problems unless stated otherwise. So, perhaps the 8% for Football, 80% for Cricket, and 10% for Basketball are all separate, with no overlaps. But that can't be, because 8% + 80% +10% =98%, which leaves 2% as 20 students, which would make the total 1000.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is phrased such that the percentages are of the total, but without considering overlaps. But since the problem doesn't provide any info about overlaps, the most straightforward approach is to add the percentages and subtract any overlaps. But without knowing the overlaps, that's impossible. So, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by adding the percentages and considering that the rest are the 20 students.\n\nWait, but if I add 8% + 80% +10% =98%, then the remaining 2% is 20 students. So, 2% =20, so 1% =10, 100% is 1000. So, that makes sense. So, the answer is 1000, option E.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the 20 students are the remaining after all the sports. So, if 8% are Football, 4/5 (which is 80%) are Cricket, 10% are Basketball, then the sum of these percentages is 8% +80% +10% =98%, so 2% are left, which is 20 students. So, 2% =20, so 1% =10, 100% =1000.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer should be E) 1000.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details right.\n\nThe question is about finding the total number of students in a class based on their interests in different games and the number who aren't interested in any. Hmm, okay. Let's break it down.\n\nSo, the problem says that 8% of the total students are interested in Football. Then, 4/5 of the total are interested in Cricket. Oh wait, 4/5 is like 80%, right? Because 4 divided by 5 is 0.8, which is 80%. So 80% interested in cricket.\n\nNext, 10% of the total students are interested in Basketball. And then, there's a group of 20 students who aren't interested in any games. The question is, how many students are there in total?\n\nLet me think. So, the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, Basketball, plus the ones not interested in any should add up to 100% of the class, right?\n\nWait, but wait. The way it's phrased, each of these percentages is of the total students. So 8% for Football, 80% for Cricket, 10% for Basketball. But I should check if these are all separate or if some students might be interested in more than one game. The problem doesn't specify, but I think for this problem, we can assume that each percentage is independent, meaning that each student's interest is counted in each category. So, perhaps, the total percentage would be the sum of these, but if there's an overlap, that complicates things. However, since the problem doesn't mention overlapping, maybe it's safe to assume that these are separate groups. But wait, no, that's not the case because each student can be interested in multiple sports.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with percentages and fractions yet. But I'll try to think it through step by step.\n\nThe problem says: In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball, and the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class?\n\nHmm, let me try to break this down. So, I need to find the total number of students. Let's call that number N, maybe. Then, the problem gives me different percentages and fractions of N, and the rest are 20 students.\n\nWait, so let me list out what each part means:\n\n- Football: 8% of N \u2192 0.08N\n- Cricket: 4/5 of N \u2192 which is 0.8N because 4 divided by 5 is 0.8\n- Basketball: 10% of N \u2192 0.10N\n- Remaining: 20 students \u2192 so this is the part that's left after adding up all the others.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. Are these the only interests, or are the students possibly interested in more than one sport? The way the question is worded, it says \"interested in Football,\" \"interested in Cricket,\" etc. It doesn't specify whether a student could be interested in multiple sports or if these are mutually exclusive. But I think in these types of problems, unless stated otherwise, we assume that the percentages are separate, so a student might be counted in more than one category. But wait, that complicates things because then the sum of the percentages could be more than 100%, but in this case, let's see.\n\nWait, no, wait a second. Wait, the problem says that 20 students are not interested in any. So the sum of all the interested students plus 20 should equal N.\n\nSo, the total number of students is equal to the sum of students interested in Football, Cricket, Basketball, plus those not interested in any.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. If a student is interested in more than one sport, they would be counted in each category. So, for example, a student who likes both Football and Cricket would be included in both the Football and Cricket percentages. So when we add them up, that student would be counted twice. But in reality, we can't just add them up because that would overcount.\n\nHmm, but wait, the problem doesn't provide any information about overlaps. It just gives percentages for each sport. Without knowing how much overlap there is, it's impossible to calculate the exact number of students interested in at least one sport. Because if there's a lot of overlap, the total number of interested students could be less than the sum of the percentages.\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't mention anything about overlaps, so perhaps it's intended that we assume that the interested students are mutually exclusive. Or maybe that the percentages are of the total, and the 20 are the remainder.\n\nWait, but looking at the numbers given, let's see:\n\nLet me add up the percentages:\n\n8% (Football) + 4/5 (80%) (Cricket) +10% (Basketball) = 8 +80 +10 = 98%.\n\nWait, 8+80 is 88, plus 10 is 98. So 98% are interested in at least one sport, and 2% are not, which is 20 students. So the 2% equals 20 students.\n\nSo if 2% of N is 20, then N is 20 / 0.02.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because 2% is 20 students, so N is 20 divided by 0.02.\n\nLet me calculate that. 20 divided by 0.02 is the same as 20 * 50, which is 1000. So N would be 1000.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option E is 1000. So that's probably the answer.\n\nWait, but wait. I thought earlier that the sum of the percentages was 98%, so 2% are not interested, which is 20. That seems correct. So N is 1000.\n\nBut let me double-check. Let's compute each part:\n\nN=1000.\n\nFootball: 8% \u2192 80 students.\n\nCricket: 4/5 \u2192 0.8*1000=800.\n\nBasketball:10%\u2192100.\n\nNow, 80 +800 is 880, plus 100 is 980. So 980 students are interested in at least one sport.\n\nThe remaining is 1000 -980 =20, which matches the problem statement. So yes, that works.\n\nBut wait, I think I made an assumption that the 20 students are outside the other percentages, which is correct. So the answer is E)1000.\n\nWait, but why is the option B) 800 in the options? Let me think again. Did I make a mistake in adding the percentages?\n\nWait, 8% +80% is 88%, plus 10% is 98%. So 2% is 20 students, which gives N=1000. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem counts students interested in any of the sports as the sum of each, but that would be wrong because some students are in more than one. But the problem doesn't provide data on overlaps, so perhaps the initial approach is correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is intended to have the sum of the percentages as the interested students, regardless of overlap. So in that case, the sum is 98%, and the remaining 2% is 20, so N=1000.\n\nSo the correct answer is E)1000.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the total number of students in the class, let the total number of students be \\( N \\).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with percentages and fractions yet. But I'll try to think it through step by step.\n\nThe problem says: In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball, and the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class?\n\nHmm, let me try to break this down. So, I need to find the total number of students. Let's call that number N, maybe. Then, the problem gives me different percentages and fractions of N, and the rest are 20 students.\n\nWait, so let me list out what each part means:\n\n- Football: 8% of N \u2192 0.08N\n- Cricket: 4/5 of N \u2192 which is 0.8N because 4 divided by 5 is 0.8\n- Basketball: 10% of N \u2192 0.10N\n- Remaining: 20 students \u2192 so this is the part that's left after adding up all the others.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. Are these the only interests, or are the students possibly interested in more than one sport? The way the question is worded, it says \"interested in Football,\" \"interested in Cricket,\" etc. It doesn't specify whether a student could be interested in multiple sports or if these are mutually exclusive. But I think in these types of problems, unless stated otherwise, we assume that the percentages are separate, so a student might be counted in more than one category. But wait, that complicates things because then the sum of the percentages could be more than 100%, but in this case, let's see.\n\nWait, no, wait a second. Wait, the problem says that 20 students are not interested in any. So the sum of all the interested students plus 20 should equal N.\n\nSo, the total number of students is equal to the sum of students interested in Football, Cricket, Basketball, plus those not interested in any.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. If a student is interested in more than one sport, they would be counted in each category. So, for example, a student who likes both Football and Cricket would be included in both the Football and Cricket percentages. So when we add them up, that student would be counted twice. But in reality, we can't just add them up because that would overcount.\n\nHmm, but wait, the problem doesn't provide any information about overlaps. It just gives percentages for each sport. Without knowing how much overlap there is, it's impossible to calculate the exact number of students interested in at least one sport. Because if there's a lot of overlap, the total number of interested students could be less than the sum of the percentages.\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't mention anything about overlaps, so perhaps it's intended that we assume that the interested students are mutually exclusive. Or maybe that the percentages are of the total, and the 20 are the remainder.\n\nWait, but looking at the numbers given, let's see:\n\nLet me add up the percentages:\n\n8% (Football) + 4/5 (80%) (Cricket) +10% (Basketball) = 8 +80 +10 = 98%.\n\nWait, 8+80 is 88, plus 10 is 98. So 98% are interested in at least one sport, and 2% are not, which is 20 students. So the 2% equals 20 students.\n\nSo if 2% of N is 20, then N is 20 / 0.02.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because 2% is 20 students, so N is 20 divided by 0.02.\n\nLet me calculate that. 20 divided by 0.02 is the same as 20 * 50, which is 1000. So N would be 1000.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option E is 1000. So that's probably the answer.\n\nWait, but wait. I thought earlier that the sum of the percentages was 98%, so 2% are not interested, which is 20. That seems correct. So N is 1000.\n\nBut let me double-check. Let's compute each part:\n\nN=1000.\n\nFootball: 8% \u2192 80 students.\n\nCricket: 4/5 \u2192 0.8*1000=800.\n\nBasketball:10%\u2192100.\n\nNow, 80 +800 is 880, plus 100 is 980. So 980 students are interested in at least one sport.\n\nThe remaining is 1000 -980 =20, which matches the problem statement. So yes, that works.\n\nBut wait, I think I made an assumption that the 20 students are outside the other percentages, which is correct. So the answer is E)1000.\n\nWait, but why is the option B) 800 in the options? Let me think again. Did I make a mistake in adding the percentages?\n\nWait, 8% +80% is 88%, plus 10% is 98%. So 2% is 20 students, which gives N=1000. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem counts students interested in any of the sports as the sum of each, but that would be wrong because some students are in more than one. But the problem doesn't provide data on overlaps, so perhaps the initial approach is correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is intended to have the sum of the percentages as the interested students, regardless of overlap. So in that case, the sum is 98%, and the remaining 2% is 20, so N=1000.\n\nSo the correct answer is E)1000.\n\n\nTo determine the total number of students in the class, let the total number of students be \\( N \\). The problem provides the following information:\n\n- **Football**: 8% of \\( N \\), which is \\( 0.08N \\).\n- **Cricket**: \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\) of \\( N \\), which is \\( 0.8N \\).\n- **Basketball**: 10% of \\( N \\), which is \\( 0.10N \\).\n- **Remaining students**: 20 students who are not interested in any of the games.\n\nThe total number of students can be expressed as the sum of students interested in Football, Cricket, Basketball, and those not interested in any games:\n\n\\[\nN = 0.08N + 0.8N + 0.10N + 20\n\\]\n\nCombine the terms involving \\( N \\):\n\n\\[\nN = (0.08 + 0.8 + 0.10)N + 20\n\\]\n\n\\[\nN = 0.98N + 20\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\( 0.98N \\) from both sides to isolate \\( N \\):\n\n\\[\nN - 0.98N = 20\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0.02N = 20\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\( N \\) by dividing both sides by 0.02:\n\n\\[\nN = \\frac{20}{0.02} = 1000\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of students in the class is \\( 1000 \\).

The remaining \\( 1000 - 980 = 20 \\) students are not interested in any games, which matches the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the total number of students is **1000**.\n\nAnswer: E",
