      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about two cars starting from the same point and going in the same direction. Both started at the same time, but they're going different speeds. The first car is going 55 mph, and the second is going 52 mph. The question is asking how much time will pass before they're 15 miles apart.\n\nHmm, I remember that when two objects move in the same direction, the relative speed between them is the difference in their speeds. So, the faster car is catching up, but since both are moving forward, the distance between them increases at the rate of their speed difference.\n\nWait, let me think. Oh right! If the first car is faster, the distance between them will increase at (55 - 52) mph. So that's 3 mph. Because every hour, the first car is moving 3 miles more than the second.\n\nSo, the problem is about how long it takes for that distance to reach 15 miles. Since the relative speed is 3 mph, time is distance divided by speed. So time = 15 miles / 3 mph. That's 5 hours. Oh, but wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait, the initial position is the same, so at t=0, both are at the same spot. As time passes, the first car moves ahead. So the distance between them is indeed the difference in their distances traveled. So distance by first car is 55t, second is 52t. The difference is 3t. So 3t =15 miles. Solving for t gives t=5 hours. So the answer should be 5 hours, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me plug the numbers in. After 5 hours, first car goes 55 *5 = 275 miles. Second goes 52 *5=260 miles. The difference is 275-260=15 miles. Yep, that checks out. So the correct answer is B)5 hours.\n",

Yeah, when two objects are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the subtraction of their speeds. So 55 minus 52 equals 3 mph. That means the distance between them increases by 3 miles every hour.\n\nNow, the question is asking how long it takes for them to be 15 miles apart. Since the relative speed is 3 mph, time is distance divided by speed. So time equals 15 miles divided by 3 mph. Let me calculate that. 15 divided by 3 is 5. So the time should be 5 hours.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 5 hours. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Both cars start at the same point, so initially, the distance is zero. As time passes, the faster car moves ahead. The distance between them increases at 3 mph. So yeah, to get 15 miles, it's 15/3=5 hours. That makes sense.\n\n\nThe two cars start from the same point and travel in the same direction. The first car moves at 55 mph, while the second car moves at 52 mph. To determine how long it takes for them to be 15 miles apart, we calculate the relative speed between them. Since they are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference in their speeds: \n\n\\[\n\\text{Relative speed} = 55 \\, \\text{mph} - 52 \\, \\text{mph} = 3 \\, \\text{mph}.\n\\]\n\nThis means the distance between the two cars increases by 3 miles every hour. To find the time it takes for the distance between them to reach 15 miles, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Relative speed}} = \\frac{15 \\, \\text{miles}}{3 \\, \\text{mph}} = 5 \\, \\text{hours}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the time it takes for the cars to be 15 miles apart is 5 hours. \n\nAnswer: B",

They both left at the same time, but the first car is going faster than the second. The question is asking how much time will pass before they are 15 miles apart. Hmm, I think I can figure this out by calculating their relative speed.\n\nWait, so the first car is going 55 mph, and the second is going 52 mph. Since they're moving in the same direction, the distance between them depends on how much faster the first car is than the second. Oh right, relative speed is the key here. The relative speed is the difference between their speeds because they're moving in the same direction.\n\nSo the relative speed would be 55 minus 52, which is 3 mph. That means every hour, the first car is getting 3 miles ahead of the second car. Now, the problem is asking when they'll be 15 miles apart. So I guess I need to find the time it takes for the distance between them to reach 15 miles.\n\nLet me think, if the first car is moving away at 3 mph, then the time (t) multiplied by 3 mph should equal 15 miles. So the formula would be time = distance divided by speed. The distance here is 15 miles, and the speed is 3 mph. So t = 15 / 3. That's 5 hours.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Because both cars started at the same time from the same point, the first car is indeed pulling away at 3 mph. So in each hour, the gap increases by 3 miles. So after one hour, 3 miles apart. Two hours, 6 miles. Three hours, 9. Four hours, 12. Five hours, 15. Yeah, that makes sense. So the time is 5 hours.
