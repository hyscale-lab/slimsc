      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where Ram and Krishna start from points A and B respectively, and they're moving towards each other. Their speeds are given as 20 m/s for Ram and 40 m/s for Krishna. They meet after 10 seconds, and I need to find the total distance between A and B. The options are A)700 meters, B)1000 meters, C)700 kilometers, D)555 meters, E)600 meters.\n\nHmm, let me think. So, when two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. Oh wait, right, because they're moving in opposite directions. So the combined speed would be 20 + 40 = 60 m/s.\n\nThey meet after 10 seconds. So the distance they cover together in that time should be the distance between A and B. Because when they meet, the sum of the distances they've traveled equals the total distance between A and B.\n\nSo the formula I can use is distance = speed \u00d7 time. So total distance D = (20 + 40) m/s * 10 s.\n\nLet me calculate that. 20+40 is 60. 60 multiplied by 10 is 600. So D should be 600 meters.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Ram's speed is 20 m/s, so in 10 seconds he covers 20*10=200 meters. Krishna at 40 m/s covers 40*10=400 meters. Together, 200+400=600 meters. Yep, that makes sense.

So, the question is about Ram and Krishna starting from points A and B respectively, and moving towards each other. They meet at point C after 10 seconds.

Wait, both are moving towards each other, so their speeds would add up when calculating the relative speed.\n\nOh right, when two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. So Ram's speed is 20 m/s, Krishna's is 40 m/s, so together it's 60 m/s. \n\nThey meet after 10 seconds.

Yep, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, could I have made a mistake in units? No, the speeds are in meters per second and time in seconds, so the units should be meters. So 600 meters is correct.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where Ram and Krishna start from points A and B, respectively, and they're moving towards each other. Their speeds are 20 m/s and 40 m/s. They meet at point C after 10 seconds, and I need to find the total distance between A and B. Hmm.\n\nWait, I think I remember that when two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. So in this case, Ram is going at 20 m/s and Krishna at 40 m/s. So adding those together, their relative speed is 60 m/s. Oh right, because they're moving towards each other, so their speeds add up.\n\nThey meet after 10 seconds. So the distance each covers in those 10 seconds would add up to the total distance between A and B. Right. Because until they meet, the sum of the distances they've covered equals the initial distance between A and B.\n\nSo for Ram, in 10 seconds, he would have covered distance = speed \u00d7 time. His speed is 20 m/s, so 20 * 10 = 200 meters. Similarly, Krishna's speed is 40 m/s, so 40 *10 = 400 meters. \n\nAdding those together, 200 + 400 = 600 meters. So the total distance between A and B should be 600 meters. \n\nLooking at the options, option E is 600 meters. So I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Oh yeah, because they start at the same time and meet after 10 seconds, the sum of the distances they've each traveled is the initial distance between A and B. Yep, that makes sense. So the total distance is 20*10 +40*10=600 meters. So the answer should be E.\n\n\nWhen Ram and Krishna start moving towards each other from points A and B, their speeds are 20 m/s and 40 m/s, respectively.
