      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about chocolates in a store, and I'm supposed to figure out what percentage of them are both vanilla flavored and not squashed. Hmm, let's see. I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says that all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored. So, no other flavors are possible. That means the total percentage of vanilla and cocoa must add up to 100%. Got it.\n\nNext, it says that 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored. Oh, so that leaves the rest as vanilla. Let me calculate that. If 10% are cocoa, then 100% minus 10% is 90% vanilla. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, no. Wait, wait. Because it says all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa. So yes, 10% cocoa, 90% vanilla. Right.\n\nBut then, the problem continues. 90% of the rest are squashed. Wait, the rest refers to what's left after the cocoa? Or the rest of something else? Let me read it again: \"90% of the rest are squashed.\" Oh, the rest after what? Oh, after the 10% cocoa, so the rest would be the vanilla ones. So the 90% vanilla are the rest.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The problem says 10% are cocoa, 90% of the rest are squashed. So perhaps \"the rest\" is the rest after taking out the cocoa. So the rest would be 90% (because 100% -10% =90%). Then, 90% of that rest are squashed. So squashed chocolates are 90% of 90% of the total.\n\nWait, but wait. The \"rest\" might not refer to the vanilla. Let me make sure. The way it's worded: 10% are cocoa, then 90% of the rest are squashed. So \"rest\" is after the 10% cocoa. So the rest is 90% of the total chocolates. Then, 90% of that rest are squashed. So squashed is 90% of 90% which is 81% of the total.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Are all squashed chocolates vanilla? Or could some be cocoa? No, because the squashed chocolates are 90% of the rest, which is the vanilla 90%. So all the squashed ones are vanilla. So the squashed are 81% of the total.\n\nBut the question is about vanilla and not squashed. So how much is that?\n\nWe have 90% vanilla. Out of those, 90% are squashed. So the remaining 10% of vanilla are not squashed. So 10% of 90% is 9% of the total.\n\nWait, so the percentage of vanilla and not squashed is 9%? Let me check that again.\n\nTotal chocolates: 100%.\n\nCocoa: 10%.\n\nSo vanilla: 90%.\n\nOf the vanilla, 90% are squashed. So 90% of 90% is 81% squashed (and vanilla). Then the remaining 10% of vanilla are not squashed. So 10% of 90% is 9%.\n\nSo the answer should be 9%, which is option D.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through the steps again.\n\nTotal = 100%.\n\nCocoa = 10% \u2192 Vanilla = 90%.\n\nOf the vanilla, 90% are squashed. So squashed vanilla is 90% of 90% = 81% of total.\n\nVanilla not squashed is 90% - 81% = 9% of total.\n\nSo yes, the answer is 9%, which is option D.\n",

Since 81 are squashed, the rest of the vanilla must be un-squashed. So 90 total vanilla minus 81 squashed equals 9 not squashed.\n\nWait, 9 out of 100 total chocolates. So 9% of the chocolates are vanilla and not squashed. Let me check the options. Option D is 9%, so that should be the answer.\n\nWait, wait, let me double-check. Total is 100. 10% cocoa (10), so 90 vanilla. 90% of the vanilla are squashed, which is 81. So the non-squashed vanilla is 90 -81=9. 9 out of 100 is 9%. So yes, D is correct.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Total Chocolates**: Assume there are 100 chocolates for simplicity.\n2. **Cocoa Flavored**: 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, so there are 10 cocoa-flavored chocolates.\n3. **Vanilla Flavored**: Since all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa, the remaining 90 chocolates are vanilla flavored.\n4. **Squashed Chocolates**: 90% of the vanilla chocolates are squashed. Thus, 90% of 90 is \\( 0.9 \\times 90 = 81 \\) squashed vanilla chocolates.\n5. **Unsquashed Vanilla Chocolates**: The number of vanilla chocolates that are not squashed is \\( 90 - 81 = 9 \\).\n6. **Percentage Calculation**: Out of 100 chocolates, 9 are vanilla and not squashed. Therefore, the percentage is \\( \\frac{9}{100} \\times 100 = 9\\% \\).\n\nThus, the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is **9%**.\n\nAnswer: D",

Wait, what's \"the rest\" referring to here? Let me think. Oh, I think \"the rest\" is the vanilla ones because the first part was about cocoa. So after taking out the 10% cocoa, the rest are vanilla, which is 90%.\n\nSo 90% of these vanilla chocolates are squashed. Wait, wait. Wait, 90% of the vanilla are squashed? So how many are not squashed?\n\nLet me do the math. So, 90% of the vanilla are squashed, meaning 10% of the vanilla are not squashed. Because 100% - 90% =10%. So the not squashed vanilla chocolates would be 10% of 90, which is 9 chocolates. Because 10% of 90 is 9. \n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. The problem says 90% of the rest are squashed. The rest after cocoa is vanilla, so 90% of vanilla are squashed. So squashed vanilla is 90% of 90, which is 81. So the not squashed would be 10% of 90, which is 9. \n\nSo the question is asking for the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla and not squashed. So that's 9 out of the total 100. So that's 9%, right?\n\nLooking at the options, D is 9%. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, wait another moment. Let me double-check. The total chocolates: 100. 10% cocoa (10), 90% vanilla (90). 90% of vanilla are squashed, so 90% of 90 is 81 squashed vanilla. So 10% of 90 is 9 not squashed vanilla. So 9 out of 100 total, which is 9%.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Total Chocolates**: Assume there are 100 chocolates for simplicity.  \n2. **Cocoa Flavored**: 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, which equals 10 chocolates.  \n3. **Vanilla Flavored**: Since all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa, the remaining 90 chocolates are vanilla.  \n4. **Squashed Chocolates**: 90% of the vanilla chocolates are squashed.  \n   - 90% of 90 vanilla chocolates = \\( 0.9 \\times 90 = 81 \\) squashed vanilla chocolates.  \n   - Therefore, 10% of the vanilla chocolates are not squashed:  \n     \\( 10\\% \\times 90 = 9 \\) not squashed vanilla chocolates.  \n5. **Final Calculation**: The number of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is 9 out of 100, which is 9%.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **9%**, corresponding to option D.\n\nAnswer: D",
