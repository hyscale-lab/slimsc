      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question says, if 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, how much will B bottles cost in dollars? Hmm, okay, I think I can handle this.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. First, I need to find out the cost per bottle. If 27 bottles cost A cents, then each bottle should cost A divided by 27 cents. So the cost per bottle is A/27 cents. Right, because if you multiply 27 by that, you get A cents.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the cost of B bottles. So I should multiply the cost per bottle by B. That would be (A/27) * B cents. But wait, the question wants the answer in dollars, not cents. Oh right, because 1 dollar is 100 cents. So I need to convert that into dollars.\n\nLet me think. So if the total cost in cents is (A*B)/27, then to get dollars, I divide by 100. So dollars = (A*B)/(27*100) which simplifies to AB/(2700). Hmm, looking at the options, option A is AB/2700. So that would be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me think of it another way. Let's say 27 bottles cost A cents. So the price per bottle is A/27 cents. So B bottles would be (A/27) * B cents. To convert to dollars, since 1 dollar is 100 cents, I divide by 100. So (AB/27) / 100 = AB/(27*100) = AB/2700. Yeah, that's the same as before.\n\nLooking at the options again: A) AB/2700, B) 27/AB, C) AB/270, D) 2700/AB, E) 100AB/27. So the correct one is A.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: Let's say A is 2700 cents, which is 27 dollars. So 27 bottles cost 27 dollars, so each bottle is 1 dollar. Then B bottles would cost B dollars. Plugging into option A, AB/2700 = (2700 * B)/2700 = B. That makes sense. So yes, option A gives the right answer in this scenario.\n\nAlternatively, if A is 100 cents (so a dollar), then 27 bottles cost $1, each is 100/27 cents. Then B bottles would cost B*(100/27)/100 = B/27 dollars. Plugging into option A: AB/2700 = (100 * B)/2700 = B/27. Which matches. So yeah, that's correct.\n\nI think I'm confident that option A is the right choice.\n",

So, the cost per bottle would be A divided by 27. Because if 27 bottles are A cents, then each is A/27 cents. Yeah, that sounds right.\n\nSo, cost per bottle is A/27 cents. Now, for B bottles, the total cost in cents would be (A/27) multiplied by B. Let me write that: (A/27)*B = AB/27 cents.\n\nBut wait, the answer needs to be in dollars. Oh right, because 1 dollar is 100 cents. So I need to convert cents to dollars. So, I'll divide the total cents by 100. So, (AB/27) cents is equal to (AB/27)/100 dollars. Simplifying that, it's AB/(27*100) = AB/2700 dollars.\n\nWait, let me check that again. So, if I have AB/27 cents, converting to dollars is dividing by 100. So, (AB/27) / 100 = AB/(27*100) = AB/2700. So, the total cost is AB divided by 2700 dollars.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is AB/2700. So, that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Another approach: Let me think in terms of unit conversion. \n\n27 bottles = A cents. So, 1 bottle = A/27 cents. So, B bottles would be B * (A/27) cents. To convert to dollars, divide by 100. So, (AB/27)/100 = AB/(27*100) = AB/2700. Yep, that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it: The cost per bottle in dollars is (A cents) / 27 bottles = (A/100 dollars) / 27. So, per bottle is A/(27*100) dollars. Then, for B bottles, it's B * (A/(27*100)) = AB/(2700) dollars. Same result.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up any steps. Sometimes when I'm in a hurry, I might confuse the steps. Let me go through it again.\n\n1. 27 bottles cost A cents.\n2. So, 1 bottle costs A/27 cents.\n3. B bottles would cost B*(A/27) cents.\n4. To convert cents to dollars: total cents / 100.\n5.

Then 2700/(27*27) = 2700/729 \u22483.7037, which is way more than the correct 0.27. So D is wrong.\n\nOption E is 100AB/27. Let's plug in A=27, B=27. 100*27*27 /27 = 100*27 = 2700. Which is way more than the correct 0.27. So E is wrong.\n\nSo the only correct option is A, which is AB/2700.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by determining the cost per bottle in cents. Since 27 bottles cost \\( A \\) cents, the cost per bottle is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost per bottle} = \\frac{A}{27} \\, \\text{cents}.\n\\]\n\nFor \\( B \\) bottles, the total cost in cents is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost in cents} = \\frac{A \\cdot B}{27}.\n\\]\n\nTo convert this to dollars, we divide by 100 (since 100 cents = 1 dollar):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost in dollars} = \\frac{A \\cdot B}{27 \\cdot 100} = \\frac{A \\cdot B}{2700}.\n\\]\n\nNow, we compare this result with the given options:\n\n- **Option A**: \\( \\frac{AB}{2700} \\) matches the derived formula.\n- **Option B**: \\( \\frac{27}{AB} \\) is incorrect as it flips the numerator and denominator.\n- **Option C**: \\( \\frac{AB}{270} \\) is incorrect because it is 10 times larger than the correct value.\n- **Option D**: \\( \\frac{2700}{AB} \\) is incorrect as it inverts the relationship.\n- **Option E**: \\( \\frac{100AB}{27} \\) is incorrect as it overestimates the cost by a factor of 100.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: A**",
