      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. A rope that's 20 meters long is cut into two pieces. One piece is 3 meters shorter than the other. I need to find the length of the longer piece.\n\nHmm, right. So, let's think. Let me visualize it. There's a rope, 20 meters in total. When you cut it into two pieces, the sum of their lengths should be 20. Oh wait, that's correct because the whole is the sum of its parts.\n\nSo, let's call the lengths of the two pieces. Maybe I should assign variables to them. Let me say that one piece is x meters long. Then the other piece would be x plus 3 meters, because it's 3 meters longer. Wait, wait, the problem says one is 3 meters shorter than the other. So if one is shorter by 3, the longer one is 3 meters longer.\n\nWait, no. Let me get that straight. If piece A is shorter than piece B by 3 meters, then A = B -3. Or, alternatively, B = A +3. Either way. So perhaps I should set up the variables correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can let the longer piece be L meters, and the shorter one would then be L -3. Because the shorter is 3 meters less than the longer. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the sum of the two pieces is 20 meters. So, L + (L -3) = 20. Let me write that down:\n\nL + (L - 3) = 20.\n\nSimplify that equation. Combine like terms.\n\n2L -3 = 20.\n\nThen, add 3 to both sides to get rid of the -3.\n\n2L = 23.\n\nDivide both sides by 2.\n\nL = 23/2.\n\n23 divided by 2 is 11.5. So, L is 11.5 meters. So the longer piece is 11.5 meters long.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If the longer is 11.5, then the shorter is 11.5 -3 = 8.5. Adding those together: 11.5 + 8.5 = 20. Yep, that adds up correctly.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 11.5. So the answer should be D.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me think again. Did I set up the equations correctly? Because sometimes when you're setting up variables, it's easy to mix up which one is which.\n\nWait, the problem says one piece is 3 meters shorter than the other. So, if I let the longer one be L, then the shorter is L-3. So yes, that's correct. So the setup was right.\n\nAnother approach: Let me think about it as two variables. Let the two pieces be x and y, where y is longer than x by 3 meters.\n\nSo, x + y =20.\n\nAnd y = x +3.\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first:\n\nx + (x +3) =20.\n\n2x +3 =20.\n\n2x=17.\n\nx=8.5.\n\nThen y = 8.5 +3 =11.5. So same result. So that's correct.\n\nSo the longer piece is 11.5 meters, which is option D.\n",

When it's cut into two pieces, the sum of the lengths of those two pieces should add up to 20. Right. Let me denote the lengths. Let's say the longer piece is L meters, and the shorter one is S meters. The problem says that one is 3 meters shorter than the other.

Oh right, that also works. So yeah, the answer should be D, 11.5 meters.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let the length of the longer piece of rope be \\( x \\) meters. Since the shorter piece is 3 meters shorter, its length is \\( x - 3 \\) meters. The total length of the rope is 20 meters, so we set up the equation:\n\n\\[\nx + (x - 3) = 20\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n2x - 3 = 20\n\\]\n\nAdd 3 to both sides:\n\n\\[\n2x = 23\n\\]\n\nDivide by 2:\n\n\\[\nx = 11.5\n\\]\n\nThus, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters.
