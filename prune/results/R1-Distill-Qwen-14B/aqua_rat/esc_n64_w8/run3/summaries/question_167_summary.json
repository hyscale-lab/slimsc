      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about two printers, Printer A and Printer B. Both can print half a page per second. The question is asking how long it'll take them to print 100 pages together. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, first, I remember that when you have two things working together, their rates add up. Like, if one can do something at a certain rate and the other can do it at another rate, you add the rates to find the combined rate. So each printer is doing 1/2 page per second. \n\nLet me write that down. Printer A's rate is 0.5 pages per second, and Printer B's is also 0.5 pages per second. So together, their combined rate is 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 page per second. Oh, that makes sense because each is contributing half a page each second, so together they make a full page per second.\n\nWait, so if they work together, every second they produce one page. So to print 100 pages, how long does that take? If it's 1 page per second, then 100 pages would take 100 seconds. Because 100 pages divided by 1 page per second equals 100 seconds. \n\nLet me make sure I'm not missing anything. The question says each can print 1/2 page per second. So yes, adding those gives 1 page per second. So the time is 100 seconds. Looking at the options, option C is 100 seconds. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I get the units right? Let me double-check. Pages per second. So Printer A: 0.5 pages/s. Printer B: 0.5 pages/s. Together, 1 page/s. So for 100 pages, time is 100 / 1 = 100 seconds. Yep, that's right.\n\nSo the correct option is C. 100 seconds.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about two printers working together. Let me try to think it through step by step. I'm a bit rusty on work rate problems, but I remember some basics.\n\nThe question says Printer A and Printer B can each print 1/2 page per second. Hmm, wait, that's a rate. So each printer is working at a certain speed, and I need to find out how long it takes them together to print 100 pages.\n\nFirst, I think I should find out the combined printing rate of both printers. Since they work together, their rates add up. Printer A is 1/2 page per second, and Printer B is also 1/2 page per second. So together, their combined rate is 1/2 + 1/2 = 1 page per second. Oh, that makes sense. So together, they can print 1 page every second.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait a second. If each printer is 1/2 page per second, then together they can print 1 page per second. So, for 1 page, it takes 1 second. So for 100 pages, how long would that take?\n\nLet me think. If the rate is 1 page per second, then the time required would be total pages divided by rate. So time = 100 pages / 1 page per second = 100 seconds. Hmm, that would be option C.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check my math. Each printer is 0.5 pages per second. So together, it's 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 page per second. Yes, that's correct. So for 100 pages, 100 / 1 = 100 seconds. So the answer should be C) 100 seconds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think in terms of work rates. The formula I remember is Work = Rate \u00d7 Time. So, when two entities work together, their rates add. So the combined rate R = R_A + R_B.\n\nR_A is 0.5 pages/sec, R_B is 0.5 pages/sec. So R = 1 page/sec.\n\nThe work here is 100 pages. So Time = Work / Rate = 100 / 1 = 100 seconds. Yeah, that's the same as before.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Did I read the problem correctly? Each printer can print 1/2 page per second. So yes, each one is 0.5. So together, they add to 1.0. So 100 pages at 1 per second is 100 seconds. So the correct answer must be C.\n\nLooking back at the options: A)25, B)50, C)100, D)200, E)400.
