      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the reduction percentage when 120 is reduced to 96. Hmm, I remember percentage reduction involves figuring out how much has been reduced relative to the original amount. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should find out how much the value has been reduced. The original number is 120, and it's now 96. So the reduction is 120 minus 96. Let me calculate that: 120 - 96 equals 24. So the amount reduced is 24.\n\nNext, I need to find what percentage 24 is of the original number, which was 120. I think the formula for percentage reduction is (reduction amount / original amount) multiplied by 100. So plugging in the numbers, that's (24 / 120) * 100.\n\nLet me compute 24 divided by 120. Hmm, 24 \u00f7 120. Well, 120 goes into 24 0.2 times because 120 times 0.2 is 24. So that's 0.2. Now, multiplying by 100 to get the percentage: 0.2 * 100 equals 20%. So the reduction is 20%.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 20% of 120 is 24 because 120 * 0.2 is 24. Yes, that makes sense. So when you reduce 120 by 20%, you subtract 24, which brings it down to 96. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 20%, so that must be the correct answer.\n",

So, the formula for percentage decrease is [(Original Value - New Value)/Original Value] * 100.

Right, so the reduction is 24.\n\nNow, to find the percentage reduction, I think I take that amount reduced (24) and divide it by the original number (120), then multiply by 100 to get the percentage. So the formula would be (24 / 120) * 100.\n\nLet me calculate that. 24 divided by 120. Well, 120 goes into 24 a fifth, because 120 times 0.2 is 24. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 120 * 0.2 is 24? Let me check. 120 times 0.2 is indeed 24 because 100 *0.2 is 20, and 20 *0.2 is 4, so 20+4=24. So 24 divided by 120 is 0.2.\n\nThen, 0.2 multiplied by 100 gives 20%. So the reduction is 20%. Let me double-check the options given. The options are A)30%, B)40%, C)20%, D)10%, E)5%. So the correct answer should be C)20%.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So 20% of 120 is 24 because 120 * 0.2 =24. So subtracting 24 from 120 gives 96, which matches the problem. Yep, that makes sense. So the percentage reduction is 20%.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage reduction when 120 is reduced to 96, we first calculate the amount of reduction by subtracting the final value from the original value:  \n\\[\n120 - 96 = 24\n\\]  \nNext, we find the percentage reduction by dividing the amount reduced by the original value and multiplying by 100:  \n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Reduction} = \\left(\\frac{24}{120}\\right) \\times 100 = 0.2 \\times 100 = 20\\%\n\\]  \nThis matches option C.  \n\nAnswer: C",

The options are A)30%, B)40%, C)20%, D)10%, E)5%. Hmm, I need to find out the percentage decrease from 120 to 96.\n\nWait, I remember that percentage reduction is calculated by finding how much the original number has been decreased, then dividing that by the original number, and multiplying by 100 to get the percentage. So the formula should be something like: (Original - Reduced) / Original * 100.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. Original is 120, reduced is 96. So the decrease is 120 minus 96. Let me do that subtraction: 120 - 96 equals 24. So the amount reduced is 24.\n\nNow, I take that 24 and divide by the original number, which is 120. So 24 divided by 120. Hmm, what's 24/120? Well, 120 divided by 24 is 5, so 24 is 1/5 of 120. So 24/120 is 0.2. Then, to get the percentage, I multiply by 100, so 0.2 * 100 is 20%. So the reduction is 20%, right?\n\nWait, let me double-check. 20% of 120 is 24, because 10% is 12, so 20% is 24. Adding that to 96 gives 120. Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer should be option C)20%.\n\nI think that's it. So the options are A is 30%, which would be a bigger decrease than what we have. B is 40%, that's even more.
