I need to find out how many different ways he can do this. Hmm, I think this is a combinatorics problem, maybe something to do with permutations or combinations.\n\nWait, I remember something about this being a Fibonacci sequence problem. Like, each step can be reached by either taking a single step from the previous one or a double step from two before. So the number of ways to get to step n is the sum of the ways to get to step n-1 and step n-2.\n\nLet me think about it. For example, when n is 1, there's only one way: take a single step. So f(1) = 1.\n\nWhen n is 2, he can either take two single steps or one double step. So that's 2 ways. So f(2) = 2.\n\nThen for n=3, the ways would be the sum of f(2) and f(1), which is 2+1=3.\n\nSimilarly, for n=4, it's f(3)+f(2)=3+2=5.\n\nWait, so the pattern is 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and so on.

So the number of ways to reach step n depends on the ways to reach the previous steps.\n\nLet me think about smaller numbers first. Maybe that'll help me find a pattern.\n\nFor example, if there's just 1 step, he can only take one step. So that's 1 way.\n\nIf there are 2 steps, he can take two single steps (1+1) or one double step (2). That's 2 ways.\n\nWait, for 3 steps: he could take a single step and then the number of ways to get to step 2, which is 2, or a double step and then the number of ways to get to step 1, which is 1. So 2 + 1 = 3 ways.\n\nSo it seems like each step's number of ways is the sum of the two previous steps. That's exactly how the Fibonacci sequence works! So the number of ways for n steps is the (n+1)th Fibonacci number. Or wait, maybe I'm getting the indices wrong.\n\nLet me list it out for n steps:\n\nn=1 \u2192 1 way\nn=2 \u2192 2 ways\nn=3 \u2192 3 ways\nn=4 \u2192 5 ways\nn=5 \u2192 8 ways\nn=6 \u2192 13 ways\nn=7 \u2192 21 ways\nn=8 \u2192 34 ways\nn=9 \u2192 55 ways\nn=10 \u2192 89 ways?\n\nWait, so for n=10, the number is 89. Let me count that.\n\nLet me write down the Fibonacci sequence up to the 11th term because I think the way the indices work is a bit different.\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence usually starts with F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, etc.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the number of ways for n steps is equal to the (n+1)th Fibonacci number. Or maybe I'm mixing it up.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor n=1, ways=1 \u2192 which is F(2)=1 in the standard Fibonacci sequence where F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, etc. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the number of ways for step n is F(n+1), where F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2.\n\nWait, let me make a table:\n\nn | ways | Fibonacci F(n+1)\n1 | 1    | F(2)=1\n2 | 2    | F(3)=2\n3 | 3    | F(4)=3\n4 | 5    | F(5)=5\n5 | 8    | F(6)=8\n6 | 13   | F(7)=13\n7 | 21   | F(8)=21\n8 | 34   | F(9)=34\n9 | 55   | F(10)=55\n10| 89   | F(11)=89\n\nOh right, so the number of ways for 10 steps is the 11th Fibonacci number, which is 89. So the answer should be B)89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Another way to think about it is recursively. Let f(n) be the number of ways to get to step n. Then f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2), since the last step could have been one step from n-1 or two steps from n-2.\n\nBase cases: f(0)=1 (there's one way to stand at the ground without taking any steps), f(1)=1, f(2)=2.\n\nWait, so f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 2+1=3. Yep, same as before.\n\nSo f(10) is the 11th term in this series, starting from f(0). Let's compute:\n\nf(0)=1\n\nf(1)=1\n\nf(2)=f(1)+f(0)=1+1=2\n\nf(3)=f(2)+f(1)=2+1=3\n\nf(4)=f(3)+f(2)=3+2=5\n\nf(5)=5+3=8\n\nf(6)=8+5=13\n\nf(7)=13+8=21\n\nf(8)=21+13=34\n\nf(9)=34+21=55\n\nf(10)=55+34=89\n\nYes, that's correct.

That's 2 ways.\n\nWait, for 3 steps: he could take a single step and then the number of ways to get to step 2, which is 2, or a double step and then the number of ways to get to step 1, which is 1. So 2 + 1 = 3 ways.\n\nSo it seems like each step's number of ways is the sum of the two previous steps. That's exactly how the Fibonacci sequence works! So the number of ways for n steps is the (n+1)th Fibonacci number. Or wait, maybe I'm getting the indices wrong.\n\nLet me list it out for n steps:\n\nn=1 \u2192 1 way\nn=2 \u2192 2 ways\nn=3 \u2192 3 ways\nn=4 \u2192 5 ways\nn=5 \u2192 8 ways\nn=6 \u2192 13 ways\nn=7 \u2192 21 ways\nn=8 \u2192 34 ways\nn=9 \u2192 55 ways\nn=10 \u2192 89 ways?\n\nWait, so for n=10, the number is 89. Let me count that.\n\nLet me write down the Fibonacci sequence up to the 11th term because I think the way the indices work is a bit different.\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence usually starts with F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, etc.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the number of ways for n steps is equal to the (n+1)th Fibonacci number. Or maybe I'm mixing it up.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor n=1, ways=1 \u2192 which is F(2)=1 in the standard Fibonacci sequence where F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, etc. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the number of ways for step n is F(n+1), where F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2.\n\nWait, let me make a table:\n\nn | ways | Fibonacci F(n+1)\n1 | 1    | F(2)=1\n2 | 2    | F(3)=2\n3 | 3    | F(4)=3\n4 | 5    | F(5)=5\n5 | 8    | F(6)=8\n6 | 13   | F(7)=13\n7 | 21   | F(8)=21\n8 | 34   | F(9)=34\n9 | 55   | F(10)=55\n10| 89   | F(11)=89\n\nOh right, so the number of ways for 10 steps is the 11th Fibonacci number, which is 89. So the answer should be B)89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Another way to think about it is recursively. Let f(n) be the number of ways to get to step n. Then f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2), since the last step could have been one step from n-1 or two steps from n-2.\n\nBase cases: f(0)=1 (there's one way to stand at the ground without taking any steps), f(1)=1, f(2)=2.\n\nWait, so f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 2+1=3. Yep, same as before.\n\nSo f(10) is the 11th term in this series, starting from f(0). Let's compute:\n\nf(0)=1\n\nf(1)=1\n\nf(2)=f(1)+f(0)=1+1=2\n\nf(3)=f(2)+f(1)=2+1=3\n\nf(4)=f(3)+f(2)=3+2=5\n\nf(5)=5+3=8\n\nf(6)=8+5=13\n\nf(7)=13+8=21\n\nf(8)=21+13=34\n\nf(9)=34+21=55\n\nf(10)=55+34=89\n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer is B)89.\n\n\nTo determine the number of ways the boy can reach the top of a staircase with 10 steps, where he can take either one or two steps at a time, we recognize that this problem follows the Fibonacci sequence. The number of ways to reach step \\( n \\) is the sum of the ways to reach step \\( n-1 \\) and step \\( n-2 \\), as the last step could have been a single step from \\( n-1 \\) or a double step from \\( n-2 \\).\n\nThe base cases are:\n- \\( f(0) = 1 \\) (one way to stand at the ground without taking any steps),\n- \\( f(1) = 1 \\) (one way to reach step 1 with a single step).\n\nUsing the recursive formula \\( f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) \\), we compute the number of ways for each step up to \\( n = 10 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nf(0) &= 1, \\\\\nf(1) &= 1, \\\\\nf(2) &= f(1) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2, \\\\\nf(3) &= f(2) + f(1) = 2 + 1 = 3, \\\\\nf(4) &= f(3) + f(2) = 3 + 2 = 5, \\\\\nf(5) &= f(4) + f(3) = 5 + 3 = 8, \\\\\nf(6) &= f(5) + f(4) = 8 + 5 = 13, \\\\\nf(7) &= f(6) + f(5) = 13 + 8 = 21, \\\\\nf(8) &= f(7) + f(6) = 21 + 13 = 34, \\\\\nf(9) &= f(8) + f(7) = 34 + 21 = 55, \\\\\nf(10) &= f(9) + f(8) = 55 + 34 = 89.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of ways to reach the top of the staircase with 10 steps is \\( f(10) = 89 \\).

The question is asking how many different ways he can reach the top. Hmm, I think this is a classic combinatorial problem, maybe something to do with Fibonacci numbers?\n\nWait, let me think. So, for each step, he has two choices: take one step or two steps. But the total number of ways depends on the number of steps he takes. Like, for a smaller number of steps, I can probably figure it out manually.\n\nLet me start by considering smaller numbers of steps and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nIf there's just 1 step, there's only one way: take a single step. So for n=1, ways=1.\n\nWhat about n=2? He can take two single steps or one double step. That's two ways. So n=2, ways=2.\n\nNow n=3. How does he get there? He could take a single step first and then have 2 steps left, which we know has 2 ways. Or he could take a double step first and then have 1 step left, which has 1 way. So total ways for n=3 would be 2+1=3.\n\nSimilarly, for n=4, he could take a single step to reach 3 steps (which has 3 ways) or a double step to reach 2 steps (which has 2 ways). So 3+2=5 ways.\n\nWait a second, this looks like the Fibonacci sequence! Because each term is the sum of the two previous terms. So the number of ways to reach step n is equal to the (n+1)th Fibonacci number or something like that?\n\nWait, let's see. Let me list the number of ways for each n:\n\nn=1 \u2192 1 way\nn=2 \u2192 2 ways\nn=3 \u2192 3 ways\nn=4 \u2192 5 ways\nn=5 \u2192 8 ways\nn=6 \u2192 13\nn=7 \u219221\nn=8 \u219234\nn=9 \u219255\nn=10 \u219289\n\nWait, wait. So for n=10, the number of ways is 89. Let me check that again.\n\nBecause, for each step n, the number of ways is ways(n) = ways(n-1) + ways(n-2).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where a boy wants to climb a staircase with 10 steps. He can take either one or two steps at a time. The question is asking how many different ways he can reach the top. Hmm, I think this is a classic combinatorial problem, maybe something to do with Fibonacci numbers?\n\nWait, let me think. So, for each step, he has two choices: take one step or two steps. But the total number of ways depends on the number of steps he takes. Like, for a smaller number of steps, I can probably figure it out manually.\n\nLet me start by considering smaller numbers of steps and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nIf there's just 1 step, there's only one way: take a single step. So for n=1, ways=1.\n\nWhat about n=2? He can take two single steps or one double step. That's two ways. So n=2, ways=2.\n\nNow n=3. How does he get there? He could take a single step first and then have 2 steps left, which we know has 2 ways. Or he could take a double step first and then have 1 step left, which has 1 way. So total ways for n=3 would be 2+1=3.\n\nSimilarly, for n=4, he could take a single step to reach 3 steps (which has 3 ways) or a double step to reach 2 steps (which has 2 ways). So 3+2=5 ways.\n\nWait a second, this looks like the Fibonacci sequence! Because each term is the sum of the two previous terms. So the number of ways to reach step n is equal to the (n+1)th Fibonacci number or something like that?\n\nWait, let's see. Let me list the number of ways for each n:\n\nn=1 \u2192 1 way\nn=2 \u2192 2 ways\nn=3 \u2192 3 ways\nn=4 \u2192 5 ways\nn=5 \u2192 8 ways\nn=6 \u2192 13\nn=7 \u219221\nn=8 \u219234\nn=9 \u219255\nn=10 \u219289\n\nWait, wait. So for n=10, the number of ways is 89. Let me check that again.\n\nBecause, for each step n, the number of ways is ways(n) = ways(n-1) + ways(n-2). That's the Fibonacci recurrence.\n\nAnd the base cases are ways(1)=1 and ways(2)=2. So let's see:\n\nways(3) = 1+2=3\nways(4)=2+3=5\nways(5)=3+5=8\nways(6)=5+8=13\nways(7)=8+13=21\nways(8)=13+21=34\nways(9)=21+34=55\nways(10)=34+55=89\n\nYes, that adds up. So the correct answer is 89, which is option B.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the number of ways a boy can climb a staircase with 10 steps, where he can take either one or two steps at a time.
