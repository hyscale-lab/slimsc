      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here about Mr. Jain betting on horses. Let me read it again. The question says there are five horses in a race, and Mr. Jain selects two of them at random to bet on. We need to find the probability that he selected the winning horse. The options are A)1/5, B)2/5, C)3/5, D)4/5, E)6/5.\n\nHmm, wait, wait. So, the race has five horses. One of them is the winner. Mr. Jain is picking two horses randomly. We need to find the probability that at least one of his two choices is the winning horse. Or wait, maybe it's the probability that he correctly selected the winning horse. Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me look again.\n\nThe question says, \"the probability that he selected the winning horse.\" So does that mean he picked the winner? Because he's selecting two horses. So if either of his two is the winner, he's selected the winning horse. Wait, but in the options, I see B is 2/5, which is 0.4, and that's one of the choices. So perhaps the probability is that one of his two selections is the winner.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's model the problem. There are 5 horses, say, labeled 1 to 5. Let's assume horse 1 is the winner. Mr. Jain picks any two of them. What's the probability that horse 1 is among his choices.\n\nAlternatively, the probability that the winning horse is among the two he chose. Because he's betting on two, and if the winner is one of them, he wins.\n\nSo the question is, when he selects two horses randomly, what's the chance that the winning horse is one of them.\n\nHow to calculate that. Well, the total number of ways he can choose two horses from five is the combination of 5 choose 2, which is 10. Because order doesn't matter when selecting.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways he can pick two horses where at least one is the winner. Alternatively, it's easier to calculate the number of ways that the winning horse is included.\n\nWait, the number of ways to choose two horses that include the winner is: since one is the winner, the other must be one of the remaining four. So for each of the four other horses, he can pair the winner with any of them. So that's 4 possible pairs.\n\nAlternatively, the number of favorable pairs is 4. Because if the winner is in the pair, the other horse can be any of the 4 others.\n\nSo the probability would be number of favorable outcomes over total outcomes. So 4/10, which simplifies to 2/5. That's option B.\n\nWait, but wait another way: Alternatively, the probability that the first horse he picks is the winner is 1/5. Then, given that he didn't pick the winner first, the probability that the second pick is the winner is (4/4)*(1/4) = 1/5 as well. Wait, no, that's not right.\n\nWait, perhaps using probability theory. The probability that he picks the winner in either of the two selections.\n\nBut since he picks two horses, the probability that the winning horse is among them is 1 minus the probability that neither of his choices is the winner.\n\nSo the probability that he didn't pick the winner in the first selection is 4/5. Then, given that, the probability that the second selection also isn't the winner is 3/4. So the probability that neither is the winner is (4/5)*(3/4) = 3/5. So the probability that he picked the winner in either selection is 1 - 3/5 = 2/5. Which again gives 2/5, option B.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you have two selections without replacement, the chance that at least one is the winner is 2/5.\n\nSo the correct answer should be B) 2/5.\n",

The probability that he selected the winning horse is... and then there are five options given.\n\nHmm, wait, so Mr. Jain is betting on two horses, right? And we're supposed to find the probability that he picked the winning horse. I think I need to clarify: does this mean that one of the horses he selected is the winner, or that both are the winners? Or perhaps that he's selected the correct horse that wins? I might be overcomplicating it. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the question is a bit ambiguous, but I think it's more likely that the race has one winning horse, and Mr. Jain bets on two horses. So the probability that at least one of his two horses is the winning horse. Or wait, maybe the question is phrased such that he's betting on two horses, and the probability that he selected the winning horse (meaning at least one of his two is the winner). But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is that the winning horse is among the two he selected. Either way, I need to approach it.\n\nLet me break it down. There are 5 horses, and one is the winner. Mr. Jain picks two horses at random. What's the probability that the winning horse is among those two?\n\nRight, so the problem is about selecting two horses from five, and finding the probability that one specific horse (the winner) is among those selected.\n\nSo, the total number of possible ways Mr. Jain can select two horses is the combination of 5 taken 2 at a time. The formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n!/(k!(n-k)!).\n\nSo 5 choose 2 is 5!/(2!3!) = (5\u00d74\u00d73!)/(2\u00d71\u00d73!) )= (20)/2 = 10. So there are 10 possible pairs he could choose.\n\nNow, how many of these pairs include the winning horse? Well, if one horse is the winner, then the other horse in the pair has to be one of the remaining four. So the number of favorable outcomes is 4, because the winning horse can be paired with any of the other four.\n\nWait, no. Wait, wait. Let me think. The number of favorable pairs is the number of ways to choose one more horse along with the winning horse. So, since the winning horse is fixed, the other horse can be any of the remaining 4. So the number of favorable pairs is 4.\n\nSo the probability is favorable over total, which is 4/10, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 2/5. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it another way. The probability that the winning horse is among the two selected is the same as 1 minus the probability that neither of the two selected is the winner.\n\nSo, the probability that the first horse he picks is not the winner is 4/5. Then, given that the first wasn't the winner, the probability that the second isn't either is 3/4. So the probability of not selecting the winner in either pick is (4/5) * (3/4) = 3/5. Therefore, the probability of selecting the winner in at least one of the two is 1 - 3/5 = 2/5. Same answer as before.\n\nSo both methods lead me to 2/5, which is option B.\n",

Mr. Jain selects two of the horses at random and bets on them. The probability that he selected the winning horse is... and then there are five options.\n\nHmm, I think I need to find the probability that among the two horses he picks, at least one is the winning horse. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the wording says he selects two and bets on them. So, does that mean he's betting that both of them will win, or at least one? Hmm, no, the way the question is phrased, the probability that he selected the winning horse. Oh, wait, perhaps the race has a single winning horse, and he picks two. So the chance that the winning horse is among his two choices.\n\nOh, I think that's the right way to look at it. Because if he selects two, he's hoping that at least one is the winner. So the question is, what's the probability that the winning horse is among the two he chose.\n\nSo let's think about it. There are 5 horses. Let's say one is the winner. Mr. Jain picks two horses randomly. What's the probability that the winning horse is in those two.\n\nAnother approach: what's the probability that he selects the winning horse in his two picks. So, the number of ways to choose two horses from five is combination of 5 choose 2. That's 10 possible pairs.\n\nNow, how many of those pairs include the winning horse? Well, the winning horse is one specific horse. So, how many pairs include that one. Well, once you've selected the winner, you need to choose one more horse from the remaining four. So that's 4 possible pairs.\n\nSo the number of favorable outcomes is 4, and the total possible is 10. So the probability is 4/10, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it: the probability that the winning horse is among the two he picks is the same as 1 minus the probability that neither of the two is the winner.\n\nSo, the probability that the first horse he picks is not the winner is 4/5. Then, the probability that the second horse he picks is not the winner, given that the first wasn't, is 3/4. So multiplying those gives (4/5)*(3/4) = 12/20 = 3/5. Then, 1 - 3/5 is 2/5. So that's the same answer as before.\n\nSo the probability is 2/5, which is option B.\n\nWait, but wait another second. Let me think about the initial approach. Oh, because when you choose two horses, the order doesn't matter. So combinations are correct.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of probability for each selection. The chance that the first horse he picks is the winner is 1/5. The chance the second is the winner is also 1/5. But wait, if he picks two, the chance that either one is the winner. Wait, but that approach might not be correct because the two events are not mutually exclusive. So you can't just add them because there's an overlap where both are the winner, which isn't possible. So that approach would give 2/5, which is correct, but perhaps it's a more convoluted way.\n\nWait no, let me think again. The probability that the first horse is the winner is 1/5, and the probability that the second horse is the winner is 1/5, but these are two different horses. Wait, but no, because the first horse is selected, then the second is selected from the remaining four. So the probability that either the first or the second is the winner. Let me model it.\n\nThe probability that the first horse is the winner is 1/5. If the first isn't, then the probability that the second is the winner is 1/4. So, the total probability is (1/5) + (4/5)*(1/4) )= 1/5 + 1/5 = 2/5.\n\nYes, that also gives 2/5. So that's consistent with the earlier methods.\n\nSo all methods point to 2/5 being the correct answer, which is option B.\n",

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the wording says he selects two and bets on them. So, does that mean he's betting that both of them will win, or at least one? Hmm, no, the way the question is phrased, the probability that he selected the winning horse. Oh, wait, perhaps the race has a single winning horse, and he picks two. So the chance that the winning horse is among his two choices.\n\nOh, I think that's the right way to look at it. Because if he selects two, he's hoping that at least one is the winner. So the question is, what's the probability that the winning horse is among the two he chose.\n\nSo let's think about it. There are 5 horses. Let's say one is the winner. Mr. Jain picks two horses randomly. What's the probability that the winning horse is in those two.\n\nAnother approach: what's the probability that he selects the winning horse in his two picks. So, the number of ways to choose two horses from five is combination of 5 choose 2. That's 10 possible pairs.\n\nNow, how many of those pairs include the winning horse? Well, the winning horse is one specific horse. So, how many pairs include that one. Well, once you've selected the winner, you need to choose one more horse from the remaining four. So that's 4 possible pairs.\n\nSo the number of favorable outcomes is 4, and the total possible is 10. So the probability is 4/10, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it: the probability that the winning horse is among the two he picks is the same as 1 minus the probability that neither of the two is the winner.\n\nSo, the probability that the first horse he picks is not the winner is 4/5. Then, the probability that the second horse he picks is not the winner, given that the first wasn't, is 3/4. So multiplying those gives (4/5)*(3/4) = 12/20 = 3/5. Then, 1 - 3/5 is 2/5. So that's the same answer as before.\n\nSo the probability is 2/5, which is option B.\n\nWait, but wait another second. Let me think about the initial approach. Oh, because when you choose two horses, the order doesn't matter. So combinations are correct.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of probability for each selection. The chance that the first horse he picks is the winner is 1/5. The chance the second is the winner is also 1/5. But wait, if he picks two, the chance that either one is the winner. Wait, but that approach might not be correct because the two events are not mutually exclusive. So you can't just add them because there's an overlap where both are the winner, which isn't possible. So that approach would give 2/5, which is correct, but perhaps it's a more convoluted way.\n\nWait no, let me think again. The probability that the first horse is the winner is 1/5, and the probability that the second horse is the winner is 1/5, but these are two different horses. Wait, but no, because the first horse is selected, then the second is selected from the remaining four. So the probability that either the first or the second is the winner. Let me model it.\n\nThe probability that the first horse is the winner is 1/5. If the first isn't, then the probability that the second is the winner is 1/4. So, the total probability is (1/5) + (4/5)*(1/4) )= 1/5 + 1/5 = 2/5.\n\nYes, that also gives 2/5. So that's consistent with the earlier methods.\n\nSo all methods point to 2/5 being the correct answer, which is option B.\n\n\nTo determine the probability that Mr. Jain selected the winning horse among his two choices, we analyze the problem as follows:\n\nThere are 5 horses in total, and Mr. Jain selects 2 horses at random. The winning horse is one specific horse, and we need to calculate the probability that this winning horse is among the two selected.\n\n### Approach 1: Counting Favorable Outcomes\nThe total number of ways to choose 2 horses out of 5 is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{5}{2} = 10\n\\]\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes (i.e., pairs that include the winning horse) is the number of ways to choose 1 more horse from the remaining 4 horses:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{1} = 4\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\n\n### Approach 2: Complementary Probability\nThe probability that the winning horse is **not** among the two selected can be calculated as:\n\n1. The probability that the first horse selected is not the winner: \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\).\n2. Given the first horse is not the winner, the probability that the second horse selected is also not the winner: \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\).\n\nThus, the probability that neither horse is the winner is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{5} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{12}{20} = \\frac{3}{5}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that the winning horse is among the two selected is:\n\n\\[\n1 - \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\n\n### Approach 3: Probability of Selecting the Winner\nThe probability that the winning horse is the first horse selected is \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\). If the first horse is not the winner, the probability that the second horse is the winner is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\). Adding these probabilities:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{5} + \\left(\\frac{4}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nAll approaches consistently yield the same result: the probability that Mr. Jain selected the winning horse is \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\).\n\nAnswer: B",

Mr. Jain selects two of them at random and bets on them. I need to find the probability that he selected the winning horse. The options are A to E, with fractions and one that's over 1, which seems a bit odd.\n\nHmm, wait. So, the race has five horses, right? And each horse has a chance to win, I assume. But the problem doesn't specify any particular probabilities for each horse winning, like if they're equally likely or not. Oh, wait, I think in these types of problems, unless stated otherwise, we can assume each horse has an equal chance of winning. So each horse has a 1/5 chance of winning.\n\nBut wait, Mr. Jain is selecting two horses, and we want the probability that at least one of them is the winning horse. Or wait, no, does it mean he's betting on both of them to win? Or does it mean he's betting that either of them wins?\n\nWait, the question says he bets on them. So I think the scenario is that he selects two horses, and the race happens. The question is the probability that he selected the winning horse. So the winning horse is the one that actually wins the race. So Mr. Jain's selection includes the winner.\n\nWait, but how? Because the race has a single winner. So if he picks two horses, one of them could be the winner, or neither. The question is the probability that at least one of his two selected horses is the winning horse.\n\nWait, no, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read: \"The probability that he selected the winning horse.\" So, the winning horse is the actual winner of the race. So, did he pick it? Because he's selecting two, so the chance that the winning horse is among his two choices.\n\nOh, okay, so the problem is about the probability that the winning horse is among the two he selected. So, what's the chance that when he picks two out of five, the winning one is in his selection.\n\nSo, the way to approach this is to think about the total number of possible ways he can select two horses, and how many of those selections include the winning horse.\n\nSo, the total number of possible pairs he can choose is the combination of 5 horses taken 2 at a time. The formula for combinations is n choose k = n!/(k! (n-k)!).\n\nSo, 5 choose 2 is 5!/(2! * 3!) = (5*4)/(2*1) = 10. So there are 10 possible pairs.\n\nNow, how many of those pairs include the winning horse? Well, the winning horse is one specific horse. So, if Mr. Jain must include this horse, then he's choosing 1 more horse from the remaining 4. So the number of favorable pairs is 4 choose 1, which is 4.\n\nWait, wait. Let me clarify. If the winning horse is Horse A, for example, then the pairs that include Horse A are: A paired with B, A paired with C, A paired with D, A paired with E. That's four pairs. So yes, 4 favorable pairs.\n\nSo the probability is the number of favorable over total. So 4/10, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 2/5. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: the probability that the winning horse is in the two selected. So, the probability that the first horse he picks is the winner is 1/5. Then, if he didn't pick the winner on the first try, the second pick has a 1/4 chance (since there are four left, and one is the winner).

Let me compute that. 5! is 120, 2! is 2, and (5-2)! is 3! which is 6. So 120 divided by (2 *6) is 120/12 = 10.

Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe question is about a race with 5 horses. Mr. Jain selects two horses at random and bets on them. We need to find the probability that he selected the winning horse. The options are A) 1/5, B) 2/5, C) 3/5, D) 4/5, E) 6/5.\n\nHmm, wait, so there's only one winning horse in the race, right? Because usually, in a race, only one horse wins. So the problem is about the probability that at least one of the two horses he picked is the winner. Or wait, no. Wait, the question says \"the probability that he selected the winning horse.\" Wait, that might be a bit ambiguous. Does it mean that at least one of the two he chose is the winner? Or does it mean both horses are the winning ones? That doesn't make sense because there's only one winner. So I think it's the probability that at least one of the two horses he selects is the winning horse.\n\nWait, but another way to interpret it is that the winning horse is among the two he selected. So he's betting on two, and the winning horse is one specific horse, so the question is, what's the chance that the winning horse is one of the two he picked.\n\nSo let's model this. There are 5 horses. He picks two. We need to find the probability that the winning horse is among those two.\n\nThe total number of ways he can select two horses from five is the combination of 5 choose 2. The formula for combinations is n!/(k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number, and k is the selection. So 5C2 is 5!/(2!3!) = (5*4)/(2*1) = 10 possible ways to choose two horses.\n\nNow, how many of these combinations include the winning horse? Well, if the winning horse is one specific horse, then the other horse he picks can be any of the remaining 4. So the number of favorable outcomes is 4. Because he has to pick the winning horse and one of the other four. So 4 possible favorable pairs.\n\nWait, let me think again. If the winning horse is, say, horse A, then the pairs that include A are (A, B), (A, C), (A, D), (A, E). So that's four pairs. So yes, 4 favorable cases.\n\nSo the probability is the number of favorable divided by total, which is 4/10. Which simplifies to 2/5. So the answer should be option B, 2/5.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the probability that the winning horse is selected in the two is the same as 1 minus the probability that neither of the two horses is the winner.\n\nSo, the probability that the first horse he picks is not the winner is 4/5. Then, given that, the probability that the second horse he picks is also not the winner is 3/4 (since there are 4 left, and one is the winner, so 3 non-winners). So the probability that neither is the winner is (4/5) * (3/4) = 3/5. So the probability that at least one is the winner is 1 - 3/5 = 2/5. Which again gives the same answer, 2/5. So option B.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: the probability that the winning horse is in the two he picked. Since he's selecting two, the chance that the winning horse is the first one he picks is 2/5 (since there are two picks and five horses, each pick has a 2/5 chance of including the winner). Or wait, no. Let me think again. The probability that the winning horse is selected in either of the two picks. So the chance is 2/5 because he's choosing two out of five.\n\nWait, that might not be accurate. Because when selecting two, the winning horse can be either the first or the second. But the way combinations work, each horse is equally likely to be in the selected pair. So each horse has a certain probability of being selected. For any individual horse, the probability that it's selected is the number of ways to choose it divided by the total number of possible pairs.\n\nSo the probability that a specific horse (say, the winner) is selected in the two is the number of pairs that include it, which is 4, as earlier, over the total 10. So 4/10 = 2/5.\n\nSo yeah, all approaches lead to the same answer, 2/5. So the correct option is B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this probability problem, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think carefully. Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe question is about a race with 5 horses. Mr. Jain selects two horses at random and bets on them. We need to find the probability that he selected the winning horse. The options are A) 1/5, B) 2/5, C) 3/5, D) 4/5, E) 6/5.\n\nHmm, wait, so there's only one winning horse in the race, right? Because usually, in a race, only one horse wins. So the problem is about the probability that at least one of the two horses he picked is the winner. Or wait, no. Wait, the question says \"the probability that he selected the winning horse.\" Wait, that might be a bit ambiguous. Does it mean that at least one of the two he chose is the winner? Or does it mean both horses are the winning ones? That doesn't make sense because there's only one winner. So I think it's the probability that at least one of the two horses he selects is the winning horse.\n\nWait, but another way to interpret it is that the winning horse is among the two he selected. So he's betting on two, and the winning horse is one specific horse, so the question is, what's the chance that the winning horse is one of the two he picked.\n\nSo let's model this. There are 5 horses. He picks two. We need to find the probability that the winning horse is among those two.\n\nThe total number of ways he can select two horses from five is the combination of 5 choose 2. The formula for combinations is n!/(k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number, and k is the selection. So 5C2 is 5!/(2!3!) = (5*4)/(2*1) = 10 possible ways to choose two horses.\n\nNow, how many of these combinations include the winning horse? Well, if the winning horse is one specific horse, then the other horse he picks can be any of the remaining 4. So the number of favorable outcomes is 4. Because he has to pick the winning horse and one of the other four. So 4 possible favorable pairs.\n\nWait, let me think again. If the winning horse is, say, horse A, then the pairs that include A are (A, B), (A, C), (A, D), (A, E). So that's four pairs. So yes, 4 favorable cases.\n\nSo the probability is the number of favorable divided by total, which is 4/10. Which simplifies to 2/5. So the answer should be option B, 2/5.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the probability that the winning horse is selected in the two is the same as 1 minus the probability that neither of the two horses is the winner.\n\nSo, the probability that the first horse he picks is not the winner is 4/5. Then, given that, the probability that the second horse he picks is also not the winner is 3/4 (since there are 4 left, and one is the winner, so 3 non-winners). So the probability that neither is the winner is (4/5) * (3/4) = 3/5. So the probability that at least one is the winner is 1 - 3/5 = 2/5. Which again gives the same answer, 2/5. So option B.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: the probability that the winning horse is in the two he picked. Since he's selecting two, the chance that the winning horse is the first one he picks is 2/5 (since there are two picks and five horses, each pick has a 2/5 chance of including the winner).

So the chance is 2/5 because he's choosing two out of five.\n\nWait, that might not be accurate. Because when selecting two, the winning horse can be either the first or the second. But the way combinations work, each horse is equally likely to be in the selected pair. So each horse has a certain probability of being selected. For any individual horse, the probability that it's selected is the number of ways to choose it divided by the total number of possible pairs.\n\nSo the probability that a specific horse (say, the winner) is selected in the two is the number of pairs that include it, which is 4, as earlier, over the total 10. So 4/10 = 2/5.\n\nSo yeah, all approaches lead to the same answer, 2/5.

We need to find the probability that he selected the winning horse. The options are A) 1/5, B) 2/5, C) 3/5, D)4/5, E)6/5.\n\nHmm, wait a minute. So the setup is that there are five horses, and only one of them is the winning horse, I assume. Because in a race, typically only one horse wins. So the problem is about selecting two horses, and wanting to know the probability that one of those two is the winner.\n\nWait, but the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again. It says, \"the probability that he selected the winning horse.\" Does that mean he wants at least one of his two bets to be the winner? Because if he selects two, either one of them could be the winner. Or does it mean he needs both to be the winning horse? But that doesn't make much sense because there's only one winning horse. So I think the question is asking for the probability that at least one of the two horses he picks is the winning one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's asking if he selected the winning horse (i.e., one of the two is the winner). So I think the correct interpretation is that at least one of the two is the winner.\n\nSo, how to approach this. Probability problems can be tricky, but thinking about the total possibilities and favorable outcomes is a good approach.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the total number of ways Mr. Jain can select two horses out of five. Since the order doesn't matter here (selecting horse A and B is the same as B and A), we can use combinations.\n\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! (n - k)!), where n is the total number and k is the number chosen.\n\nSo C(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * 3!) = (5*4*3!)/(2*1 * 3!) = (5*4)/(2) = 10. So there are 10 possible pairs of horses he could choose.\n\nNow, how many of these pairs include the winning horse? Let's think. The winning horse is one specific horse, let's say horse W. How many ways can Mr. Jain pick two horses that include W?\n\nHe has to choose W and one other horse. There are four other horses, so the number of favorable pairs is 4. Because W can be paired with each of the other four.\n\nSo the number of favorable outcomes is 4, and the total possible is 10. So the probability is 4/10, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nWait, but wait another way. Alternatively, the probability that the winning horse is among the two he selects. Another approach is to think about the probability that he selects the winner and any other horse.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as the probability of selecting the winning horse in his two picks. So, the chance of selecting the winner is the number of favorable selections divided by total selections.\n\nWait, another approach: the probability that he selects the winning horse is the same as the probability that at least one of his two choices is the winner. Alternatively, it's easier to calculate the probability that he doesn't select the winner and subtract that from 1.\n\nSo, the probability that neither of his two choices is the winner. Since there are four non-winning horses, the number of ways to choose two horses without the winner is C(4,2) = 6.\n\nSo the probability of not selecting the winner is 6/10 = 3/5. Therefore, the probability of selecting the winner is 1 - 3/5 = 2/5.\n\nWait, that's the same answer as before. So that's consistent. So the probability is 2/5, which is option B.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Another way to think about it: what's the chance that the winning horse is among his two picks?\n\nHe has two picks, and there are five horses. So the probability that the first pick is the winner is 1/5. If he didn't pick the winner first, the probability that the second pick is the winner is (4/4) [since one non-winning horse was already picked], wait no, wait.\n\nWait, no, that approach might not be correct because the selections are done without replacement, but since he's selecting two at random, perhaps it's better to model it as hypergeometric distribution.\n\nWait, another approach: the probability that one of the two is the winner.\n\nSo, the number of winning combinations is 4 (as each pair includes the winner and one other). So 4 favorable out of 10 possible, so 2/5.\n\nAlternatively, considering that when he picks two, the probability that the winning horse is in those two is the same as the probability that a single randomly chosen horse (the winner) is among the two selected.\n\nWait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps think about the probability for each horse.\n\nBut perhaps the first approach is the most straightforward. So, the probability is 2/5, which is option B.\n",

Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe question is about a race with five horses. Mr. Jain is selecting two horses at random and betting on them. We need to find the probability that he selected the winning horse. The options are A) 1/5, B) 2/5, C) 3/5, D)4/5, E)6/5.\n\nHmm, wait. So, I think the problem is that among the five horses, one is the winner. Mr. Jain picks two horses, and we need the probability that at least one of them is the winner. Because if he picks the winner, he wins, right? Or is the question about the probability that both horses he picks are the winning ones? No, wait, the question says \"the probability that he selected the winning horse.\" So maybe it's that he has the winning horse in his two choices. So, the probability that the winning horse is among his two selected.\n\nSo, the problem is: what's the probability that in a random selection of two horses from five, one of them is the winner.\n\nI remember that in probability, sometimes it's easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event and then subtract from 1. The complementary event here would be that neither of the two selected horses is the winner. So, if I find the probability that both are not winners, then subtract that from 1, I'll get the desired probability.\n\nLet me think about this. There are five horses, one is the winner. So when Mr. Jain selects two, the total number of possible ways to choose two horses is combination of 5 taken 2 at a time. The formula for combinations is nCr = n!/(r! (n-r)!)). So 5C2 is 10. So there are 10 possible pairs.\n\nNow, how many of these pairs include the winning horse? Alternatively, how many pairs do not include the winning horse. The winning horse is one specific horse, so the other four are non-winners. If Mr. Jain picks two horses, and none of them is the winner, then both must be from the four non-winners. So the number of ways to choose two non-winners is 4C2, which is 6.\n\nSo the number of pairs without the winner is 6. So the probability that he didn't pick the winner is 6/10, which simplifies to 3/5.\n\nTherefore, the probability that he did pick the winner is 1 minus 3/5, which is 2/5. Wait, so that would be 2/5. Looking at the options, that's option B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the number of favorable outcomes directly.\n\nThe number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to pick two horses where at least one is the winner. So, the winning horse can be in the first position, and the second horse can be any of the other four. But wait, no, that would be considering order, which isn't the case here because combinations are unordered.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach: the number of pairs that include the winning horse is equal to the number of ways to choose one more horse from the remaining four. So that's 4C1, which is 4. So there are four favorable pairs: each pair consists of the winner and one of the other four horses.\n\nWait, but wait a second. So the number of favorable pairs is 4, and the total is 10. So 4/10 is 2/5. That's the same as before. So yes, the probability is 2/5, which is option B.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the probability that the first horse he picks is the winner is 1/5. Then, the probability that the second horse is the winner given that the first wasn't. But wait, since he's selecting two horses without order, perhaps this approach is more complicated. Let me see.\n\nThe probability that at least one of the two is the winner can be calculated as 1 - probability that neither is the winner. So, the probability that the first horse is not the winner is 4/5. Then, given that, the probability that the second horse is also not the winner is 3/4. Because after picking one non-winner, there are three non-winners left out of four remaining horses.\n\nSo the probability that neither is the winner is (4/5) * (3/4) = (12/20) = 3/5.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe question is about a race with five horses. Mr. Jain is selecting two horses at random and betting on them. We need to find the probability that he selected the winning horse. The options are A) 1/5, B) 2/5, C) 3/5, D)4/5, E)6/5.\n\nHmm, wait. So, I think the problem is that among the five horses, one is the winner. Mr. Jain picks two horses, and we need the probability that at least one of them is the winner. Because if he picks the winner, he wins, right? Or is the question about the probability that both horses he picks are the winning ones? No, wait, the question says \"the probability that he selected the winning horse.\" So maybe it's that he has the winning horse in his two choices. So, the probability that the winning horse is among his two selected.\n\nSo, the problem is: what's the probability that in a random selection of two horses from five, one of them is the winner.\n\nI remember that in probability, sometimes it's easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event and then subtract from 1. The complementary event here would be that neither of the two selected horses is the winner. So, if I find the probability that both are not winners, then subtract that from 1, I'll get the desired probability.\n\nLet me think about this. There are five horses, one is the winner. So when Mr. Jain selects two, the total number of possible ways to choose two horses is combination of 5 taken 2 at a time. The formula for combinations is nCr = n!/(r! (n-r)!)). So 5C2 is 10. So there are 10 possible pairs.\n\nNow, how many of these pairs include the winning horse? Alternatively, how many pairs do not include the winning horse. The winning horse is one specific horse, so the other four are non-winners. If Mr. Jain picks two horses, and none of them is the winner, then both must be from the four non-winners. So the number of ways to choose two non-winners is 4C2, which is 6.\n\nSo the number of pairs without the winner is 6. So the probability that he didn't pick the winner is 6/10, which simplifies to 3/5.\n\nTherefore, the probability that he did pick the winner is 1 minus 3/5, which is 2/5. Wait, so that would be 2/5. Looking at the options, that's option B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the number of favorable outcomes directly.\n\nThe number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to pick two horses where at least one is the winner. So, the winning horse can be in the first position, and the second horse can be any of the other four. But wait, no, that would be considering order, which isn't the case here because combinations are unordered.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach: the number of pairs that include the winning horse is equal to the number of ways to choose one more horse from the remaining four. So that's 4C1, which is 4. So there are four favorable pairs: each pair consists of the winner and one of the other four horses.\n\nWait, but wait a second. So the number of favorable pairs is 4, and the total is 10. So 4/10 is 2/5. That's the same as before. So yes, the probability is 2/5, which is option B.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the probability that the first horse he picks is the winner is 1/5. Then, the probability that the second horse is the winner given that the first wasn't. But wait, since he's selecting two horses without order, perhaps this approach is more complicated. Let me see.\n\nThe probability that at least one of the two is the winner can be calculated as 1 - probability that neither is the winner. So, the probability that the first horse is not the winner is 4/5. Then, given that, the probability that the second horse is also not the winner is 3/4. Because after picking one non-winner, there are three non-winners left out of four remaining horses.\n\nSo the probability that neither is the winner is (4/5) * (3/4) = (12/20) = 3/5. So again, 1 - 3/5 is 2/5. So same result.\n\nSo all the approaches lead to 2/5, which is option B.\n\n\nTo determine the probability that Mr. Jain selects the winning horse when he bets on two horses out of five, we can approach the problem in two ways:\n\n### Approach 1: Direct Counting\nThe total number of ways to select two horses out of five is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = 10\n\\]\n\nThe number of favorable outcomes (pairs that include the winning horse) is equal to the number of ways to choose one more horse from the remaining four non-winning horses:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{1} = 4\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability of selecting the winning horse is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\n\n### Approach 2: Complementary Probability\nThe complementary event is that neither of the two selected horses is the winning horse.
