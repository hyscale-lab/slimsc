      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a discount during a sale, and I need to find the actual selling price. Hmm, let me think. The question says that Vinit bought an article for Rs.4578 after a 20% discount. Wait, wait\u2014wait, no, wait. Wait, let me read the question again. Oh, wait, no, the question is asking for the actual selling price. Wait, no, no. Wait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the problem says: In a sale, a discount of 20% was available on all articles. Vinit purchased an article for Rs.4578 in the sale. What was the actual selling price of the article? Wait, wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if he bought it during the sale, that would be the discounted price, right? So the Rs.4578 is the price after the discount, and we need to find the original price before the discount, which is the actual selling price before the sale started. Or wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's clarify the terms. The \"selling price\" can be a bit ambiguous. If the article was sold during the sale, then the price he paid (Rs.4578) is the selling price after the discount. So the original price (the marked price) would be higher. But the question is asking for the actual selling price. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is phrased differently. Let me read it again. Oh, perhaps the actual selling price is the original price before the discount. So Vinit paid 20% less than the actual selling price. So he bought it for 80% of the original price.\n\nSo the formula would be: Selling Price (after discount) = Original Price * (100 - discount)/100. So in this case, 4578 = Original Price * 80%, so Original Price = 4578 / 0.8.\n\nLet me calculate that. 4578 divided by 0.8. Let me do the division. 4578 \u00f7 0.8. Well, 0.8 is 4/5, so dividing by 4/5 is same as multiplying by 5/4. So 4578 * 5 /4.\n\nLet me compute 4578 *5 first. 4578 *5 is 22890. Then divide by 4: 22890 \u00f74. Let's see: 4 \u00d75722 is 22888, so 5722.5, because 22890 -22888=2, so 2/4=0.5. So 5722.5. Wait, but the options don't have a decimal. Let me check the options again. The options are all integers: 5050, 5723, 5040, 4950, 4870. Hmm. So 5722.5 isn't an option. So maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute 4578 /0.8 more accurately. Let's do that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of it as finding the original price when the discounted price is 80% of it.\n\nWait, another approach: 20% discount means the customer pays 80% of the original price. So the original price is the selling price before discount. So the original selling price is what they're asking for. So, 4578 is 80% of the original. So original SP = 4578 * (100/80) = 4578 * 1.25.\n\nLet me compute that. 4578 * 1.25. Well, 1.25 is 5/4. So 4578 *5=22890, divided by 4 is 5722.5. Hmm, same as before. But the options don't have a 5722.5. The closest option is B) 5723. Wait, but 5722.5 would round to 5723. So option B is 5723.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is 5723, which is 5722.5 rounded up. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I have the question right. The question says, \"What was the actual selling price of the article?\" So if the article was sold during the sale, the actual selling price would be the discounted price, right? Wait, no. Wait, maybe I'm mixing terms. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"actual selling price\" refers to the price after discount. Because when you buy something on sale, the price you pay is the discounted price. So the actual selling price would be the discounted price. But the question says Vinit bought it for Rs.4578, which is the discounted price. So the question is asking for the original price, which would be the actual selling price before discount.\n\nWait, but that's not making sense. Wait, perhaps the term \"actual selling price\" refers to the price after discount, which is what was actually paid. So in that case, the answer would be 4578. But that's not one of the options. Wait, but the options don't include 4578. So that can't be.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.\n\nQuestion: \"What was the actual selling price of the article?\" So maybe 'actual' refers to the original price. Because when it's on sale, the discounted price is the current selling price, and the actual (original) selling price would be the higher one.\n\nSo, in that case, the Rs.4578 is the discounted price, so the original price (actual selling price) is higher.\n\nSo, using the calculation: original price = 4578 / 0.8 = 5722.5. Which is approximately 5723, option B.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a sale where there's a 20% discount on all articles. Vinit bought an article for Rs.4578, and I need to find out the actual selling price before the discount. Hmm, wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Let me read the question again. Oh, right! The question says Vinit purchased it for Rs.4578 after the discount. So the Rs.4578 is the price after the discount. I need to find the original selling price, the price before the discount was applied. \n\nSo, how do discounts work? Well, a discount is a percentage reduction off the original price. So if something has a 20% discount, you pay 80% of the original price. Because 100% minus 20% is 80%. So the selling price after discount is 80% of the original.\n\nWait, so the formula would be: Selling Price (after discount) = Original Price \u00d7 (1 - discount rate). The discount rate here is 20%, which is 0.2 in decimal. So that's 1 - 0.2 = 0.8. So the equation is SP = OP \u00d7 0.8.\n\nBut in this case, we know the SP is Rs.4578, and we need to find OP. So we can rearrange the formula. OP = SP / 0.8.\n\nLet me compute that. So OP = 4578 divided by 0.8. Hmm, let me do that division. \n\nWait, 4578 divided by 0.8. Alternatively, 4578 multiplied by 10/8 because dividing by 0.8 is the same as multiplying by 10/8. Or, maybe it's easier to think of 0.8 as 4/5. Oh, right, because 0.8 is 4/5. So dividing by 4/5 is the same as multiplying by 5/4.\n\nSo OP = 4578 \u00d7 (5/4). Let me compute that. \n\nLet me break it down. 4578 divided by 4 is first. 4578 \u00f7 4. Well, 4 into 4 is 1, 4 into 5 is 1 with 1 remainder, 4 into 17 is 4 with 1 remainder, 4 into 18 is 4 with 2 remainder, and 4 into 28 is 7. Wait, maybe I should do it step by step.\n\nWait, 4 \u00d7 1000 is 4000. So 4578 - 4000 is 578. So 4 \u00d7 1447 is 5788, no wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me just do the division:\n\n4578 \u00f7 4.\n\n4 into 4 is 1. So 1.\nBring down the 5. 4 into 5 is 1 (since 4\u00d71=4). Remainder 1.\nBring down the 7, making 17. 4 into 17 is 4 (4\u00d74=16). Remainder 1.\nBring down the 8, making 18. 4 into 18 is 4 (4\u00d74=16). Remainder 2.\n\nSo that gives us 1144.5? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 4 \u00d7 1144 is 4576. So 4578 is 4576 + 2. So 4578 \u00f74 is 1144.5. Because 4 \u00d7 1144 = 4576, plus 2 is 4578, so 2/4 is 0.5. So 1144.5.\n\nSo OP is 1144.5 \u00d7 5. Because 5/4 is 1.25, but I'm multiplying by 5 and then dividing by 4, but I think I did the division already. So wait, OP = 4578 \u00d7 (5/4) = (4578 \u00d75)/4. Wait, no, 4578 \u00d75 is 22890, then divided by 4. Alternatively, 4578 \u00d75 = 22890, then 22890 \u00f74. Let me compute that.\n\n22890 \u00f74. 4 \u00d7 5000 is 20,000. So 22890-20000=2890. 4\u00d7700 is 2800. 2890-2800=90. 4\u00d722 is 88. So 5000 + 700 = 5700, +22=5722. So 5722.5? Wait, wait, 22890 divided by 4 is 5722.5. Because 4 \u00d7 5722 = 22888, then 22890-22888=2, so 2/4=0.5. So 5722.5. \n\nSo OP is 5722.5. But the options are all whole numbers. Looking at the options, option B is 5723, which is close to 5722.5. So that must be the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check. 5722.5 \u00d7 0.8 = 4578? Let me compute 5722 \u00d7 0.8. 5722 \u00d7 0.8 is 4577.6. 0.5 \u00d7 0.8 is 0.4, so total is 4577.6 + 0.4=4578. Yes, that matches. So the original price was 5722.5, which rounds to 5723 when considering whole rupees. But wait, in the options, option B is 5723, and option C is 5040. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach. Let's compute 4578 \u00f7 0.8. 0.8 is 4/5, so 4578 multiplied by 5/4.\n\nAlternatively, 4578 *5 = 22890, then divided by 4. 22890 /4 is 5722.5, as before. So the original price is 5722.5, which would be 5723 when rounded to the nearest whole number.

Remainder 1.\nBring down the 8, making 18. 4 into 18 is 4 (4\u00d74=16). Remainder 2.\n\nSo that gives us 1144.5? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 4 \u00d7 1144 is 4576. So 4578 is 4576 + 2. So 4578 \u00f74 is 1144.5. Because 4 \u00d7 1144 = 4576, plus 2 is 4578, so 2/4 is 0.5. So 1144.5.\n\nSo OP is 1144.5 \u00d7 5.

Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach. Let's compute 4578 \u00f7 0.8. 0.8 is 4/5, so 4578 multiplied by 5/4.\n\nAlternatively, 4578 *5 = 22890, then divided by 4. 22890 /4 is 5722.5, as before. So the original price is 5722.5, which would be 5723 when rounded to the nearest whole number. So the correct option is B) 5723.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is s.5723, which matches. So the answer should be option B.\n\n\nTo determine the original selling price (OP) of the article before the 20% discount, we use the relationship between the selling price after discount (SP) and the original price. A 20% discount means the selling price is 80% of the original price, or:\n\n\\[\n\\text{SP} = \\text{OP} \\times 0.8\n\\]\n\nRearranging to solve for OP:\n\n\\[\n\\text{OP} = \\frac{\\text{SP}}{0.8}\n\\]\n\nGiven that the selling price after the discount is Rs. 4578, we substitute:\n\n\\[\n\\text{OP} = \\frac{4578}{0.8}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(0.8 = \\frac{4}{5}\\), dividing by 0.8 is equivalent to multiplying by \\(\\frac{5}{4}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{OP} = 4578 \\times \\frac{5}{4}\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\(4578 \\times 5\\):\n\n\\[\n4578 \\times 5 = 22890\n\\]\n\nThen divide by 4:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{22890}{4} = 5722.5\n\\]\n\nSince the original price is typically expressed in whole rupees, we round 5722.5 to the nearest whole number, which is 5723. Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:\n\n**B) 5723**\n\nAnswer: B",

The question says that there's a 20% discount on all articles, and Vinit bought one for Rs.4578. They're asking what the actual selling price was. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because if the article was on sale with a 20% discount, Vinit paid 20% less than the original price. So the Rs.4578 he paid is the discounted price. Oh, right, so the actual selling price before the discount would be higher.\n\nSo the problem is to find the original price, which is the actual selling price before the discount. Because the discount was 20%, so the customer pays 80% of the original price.\n\nLet me think about the math. Let's denote the original price as SP. So the selling price after discount is 80% of SP. And that's equal to Rs.4578. So the equation is 0.8 * SP = 4578. To find SP, I need to divide 4578 by 0.8.\n\nLet me do that calculation. 4578 divided by 0.8. Hmm, 0.8 is the same as 4/5. So dividing by 4/5 is the same as multiplying by 5/4. So 4578 multiplied by 5 is 22890, then divided by 4.\n\nWait, 22890 divided by 4. Let me calculate that. 4 into 22 is 5, 5*4=20, remainder 2. Bring down the 8, 28 divided by 4 is 7, 7*4=28. Next digit 9, 9 divided by 4 is 2 with remainder 1. Bring down the 0: 10 divided by 4 is 2 with remainder 2. So wait, that's 5722.5?\n\nWait, wait, maybe I should compute it another way. Alternatively, 4578 divided by 0.8 is the same as 4578 multiplied by 1.25, because 1/0.8 is 1.25.\n\nSo 4578 * 1.25. Let's compute that. Let's break it down: 4578 * 1 = 4578, 4578 * 0.25 = 1144.5. So adding them together: 4578 + 1144.5 = 5722.5.

Oh, option B is 5723, which is very close to 5722.5. So that must be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculation because sometimes when I do math in my head, I might make a mistake. So, 4578 divided by 0.8. Let's compute it step by step.\n\n0.8 times what is 4578. Let me think in terms of fractions. 4/5 * SP = 4578. So SP = 4578 * 5 /4.\n\nCompute 4578 *5 first. 4578 *5: 4000 *5=20000, 500*5=2500, 70*5=350, 8*5=40. So 20000 +2500 is 22500, plus 350 is 22850, plus 40 is 22890. Now divide by 4.\n\n22890 divided by 4. Let's compute:\n\n4 into 2 is 0, 22 divided by 4 is 5, 5*4=20. 22-20=2, bring down 8: 28. 4 into 28 is 7, 7*4=28. 28-28=0. Bring down 9: 9. 4 into 9 is 2, 2*4=8, 9-8=1. Bring down 0: 10. 4 into 10 is 2, 2*4=8. 10-8=2. So we have 5722.50, which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nSo the original selling price is 5722.50, which isn't one of the options exactly, but the closest is option B, 5723.

The question says there's a 20% discount on all articles, and Vinit bought one for Rs.4578. They're asking for the actual selling price. Wait, that part is a bit confusing. Oh, wait, maybe I got that wrong. Because if Vinit bought it for Rs.4578 with a 20% discount, then Rs.4578 must be the discounted price. So the actual selling price before the discount was higher, right? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing terms. Let me clarify the terms.\n\nWait, the actual selling price is the price after the discount, I think. Because sometimes people refer to the original price as the marked price. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's read the question again.\n\nThe problem says a discount of 20% was available on all articles. Vinit purchased an article for Rs.4578 in the sale. So that Rs.4578 must be the price he paid after the discount was applied. So the original price (let's call it MRP or marked price) was higher, and after a 20% discount, he paid 4578.\n\nSo the question is asking for the actual selling price. Wait, no. Wait, I think the actual selling price is the price after the discount. Because the sale price is the discounted price. So maybe the question is actually asking for the original price before the discount. Because otherwise, if he bought it for 4578, that's the price after 20% off.\n\nWait, the way the question is phrased: \"What was the actual selling price of the article?\" Hmm. Wait, the actual selling price would be the price the article was sold for, which is the discounted price. But then why is the question being asked? Because he paid 4578, which is the discounted price. So maybe the options are incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is phrased in a way that the actual selling price is the original price, and the discounted price is what Vinit paid. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.\n\nWait, when an article is sold at a 20% discount, the selling price is 80% of the original price. So the formula would be: Selling Price = Original Price \u00d7 (1 - Discount). So if the discount is 20%, then the selling price is 80% of the original price.\n\nSo, in this case, Vinit paid Rs.4578, which is the selling price (after discount). So the original price is higher than that. So the question is asking for the original price. Because the actual selling price is the price after discount, which is already 4578. So perhaps the options are wrong, but maybe I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. The question says, \"What was the actual selling price of the article?\" Wait, maybe the actual selling price refers to the original price, which is the price without discount. Because the article's actual price is what it's supposed to cost, and the discounted price is the sale price.\n\nSo in that case, if the selling price after discount is 4578, then the original selling price (actual) would be higher.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is phrased in a confusing way. Let me try to rephrase.\n\nOriginal Price (OP) is the price before discount. The selling price during the sale is OP minus 20% discount. So the selling price is OP \u00d7 0.8.\n\nVinit bought it for 4578, which is the discounted price. So 4578 = OP \u00d7 0.8. So OP = 4578 / 0.8.\n\nLet me compute that. 4578 divided by 0.8. Let me do the calculation.\n\n0.8 is the same as 4/5. So dividing by 0.8 is the same as multiplying by 5/4.\n\nSo 4578 * 5 = let's compute that.\n\n4578 \u00d7 5:\n\n4000 \u00d75 = 20,000\n\n500 \u00d75=2500 \u2192 20,000 +2500=22,500\n\n78 \u00d75=390 \u2192 22,500 +390 =22,890.\n\nSo 4578 \u00d75 =22,890.\n\nNow divide by 4: 22,890 \u00f74.\n\n22,890 divided by 4.\n\nWell, 22,890 /4 = ?\n\nWell, 22,890 \u00f74:\n\n4 \u00d7 5723 = 22,892, which is a bit over. Wait, wait, maybe I should compute it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, 22,890 divided by 4 is 5722.5.\n\nWait, 4 \u00d75722 = 22,888.\n\n22,888 +2 =22,890. So 5722 + 0.5 is 5722.5.\n\nWait, but 4 \u00d75722.5 = 22,890, correct.\n\nSo OP is 5722.5. But the options are all in whole numbers, so 5722.5 is not an option. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the options: A)5050, B)5723, C)5040, D)4950, E)4870.\n\nWait, option B is 5723, which is very close to 5722.5. So perhaps that's the intended answer. So the original price was 5722.5, but since you can't have half a rupee in this context, it's rounded to 5723. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me check my calculation again. Maybe I made an error in the multiplication.\n\nWait, 4578 \u00d75: 4578 \u00d75.\n\n4000\u00d75=20,000.\n\n500\u00d75=2,500. 20,000 +2,500=22,500.\n\n70 \u00d75=350. 22,500 +350=22,850.\n\n8 \u00d75=40. 22,850 +40=22,890. So that's correct.\n\nDivide 22,890 by 4: 22,890 \u00f74.\n\n4 \u00d75722 = 22,888.\n\n22,888 +2 =22,890. So 5722 + (2/4)=5722.5.\n\nSo the original price is Rs.5722.5. But the options don't have this. The closest is option B, 5723.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the selling price, which would be the discounted price, but that's given as 4578, which isn't one of the options. Wait, the options don't have 4578, so that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the question is asking for the selling price after the discount, but the options don't include 4578. So that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question.\n\nWait, another way: perhaps the 20% discount is on the selling price, not on the original price. No, that wouldn't make sense. The discount is applied to the original price.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the discount is 20%, so the selling price is 80% of the original price. So the formula is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the selling price, which is 4578, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is actually asking for the original price, which would be OP, which is 5722.5, which is approximately 5723, option B.\n\nSo looking back at the options, option B is 5723. So that would be the correct answer.\n\nAnother way to check: 20% discount on 5723 would be 0.2\u00d75723=1144.6. So selling price would be 5723 -1144.6=4578.4, which is approximately 4578. So that makes sense.\n\nSo the original price is 5723, and after 20% discount, it's 4578. So the question is asking for the original price, which is 5723, option B.\n",

Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the options: A)5050, B)5723, C)5040, D)4950, E)4870.\n\nWait, option B is 5723, which is very close to 5722.5. So perhaps that's the intended answer. So the original price was 5722.5, but since you can't have half a rupee in this context, it's rounded to 5723. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me check my calculation again. Maybe I made an error in the multiplication.\n\nWait, 4578 \u00d75: 4578 \u00d75.\n\n4000\u00d75=20,000.\n\n500\u00d75=2,500. 20,000 +2,500=22,500.\n\n70 \u00d75=350. 22,500 +350=22,850.\n\n8 \u00d75=40. 22,850 +40=22,890. So that's correct.\n\nDivide 22,890 by 4: 22,890 \u00f74.\n\n4 \u00d75722 = 22,888.\n\n22,888 +2 =22,890. So 5722 + (2/4)=5722.5.\n\nSo the original price is Rs.5722.5. But the options don't have this. The closest is option B, 5723.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the selling price, which would be the discounted price, but that's given as 4578, which isn't one of the options. Wait, the options don't have 4578, so that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the question is asking for the selling price after the discount, but the options don't include 4578. So that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question.\n\nWait, another way: perhaps the 20% discount is on the selling price, not on the original price. No, that wouldn't make sense. The discount is applied to the original price.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the discount is 20%, so the selling price is 80% of the original price. So the formula is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the selling price, which is 4578, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is actually asking for the original price, which would be OP, which is 5722.5, which is approximately 5723, option B.\n\nSo looking back at the options, option B is 5723. So that would be the correct answer.\n\nAnother way to check: 20% discount on 5723 would be 0.2\u00d75723=1144.6. So selling price would be 5723 -1144.6=4578.4, which is approximately 4578. So that makes sense.\n\nSo the original price is 5723, and after 20% discount, it's 4578. So the question is asking for the original price, which is 5723, option B.\n\n\nTo determine the original price of the article before the discount, we start by noting that Vinit purchased the article for Rs. 4,578 after a 20% discount. This means that Rs. 4,578 represents 80% of the original price (since 100% - 20% = 80%). \n\nThe relationship between the selling price (after discount) and the original price can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Selling Price} = \\text{Original Price} \\times (1 - \\text{Discount})\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\n4578 = \\text{Original Price} \\times 0.8\n\\]\n\nTo find the original price, we rearrange the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Original Price} = \\frac{4578}{0.8}\n\\]\n\nPerforming the calculation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Original Price} = \\frac{4578}{0.8} = 5722.5\n\\]\n\nSince the options provided are in whole numbers, the closest value to 5722.5 is **5723**, which corresponds to option B. To verify, applying a 20% discount to 5723 gives:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Discount Amount} = 0.2 \\times 5723 = 1144.6\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Selling Price} = 5723 - 1144.6 = 4578.4\n\\]\n\nThis matches the given selling price of Rs. 4,578, confirming that the original price is approximately Rs. 5,723.\n\nAnswer: B",

Let's see what the question says. \n\nThe question is about a sale where a discount of 20% is given on all articles. Vinit bought an article for Rs.4578 during the sale. The question is asking what the actual selling price of the article was. Hmm, wait, I'm a bit confused here. Oh, right, the selling price after the discount is Rs.4578, and they want to know the original price before the discount was applied. Because the discount was 20%, that means the customer paid 80% of the original price. \n\nWait, let me get this straight. So if the discount is 20%, then the selling price is 100% minus 20%, which is 80% of the original price. So the Rs.4578 is 80% of the original price. So I need to find the original price, which is 100% or the actual selling price before the discount. \n\nThe formula I remember for this is: \n\nSelling Price = Original Price \u00d7 (100% - Discount %)\n\nIn this case, the Selling Price (SP) is Rs.4578, and the discount is 20%, so:\n\n4578 = Original Price \u00d7 (80/100)\n\nWhich simplifies to 4578 = Original Price \u00d7 0.8\n\nSo to find the Original Price, I need to divide 4578 by 0.8. Let me calculate that. \n\nHmm, 4578 divided by 0.8. Wait, dividing by 0.8 is the same as multiplying by 5/4 because 0.8 is 4/5. So 4578 multiplied by 5/4. Let me compute that. \n\nLet me do 4578 \u00d7 5 first. 4578 times 5: 4000\u00d75 is 20000, 500\u00d75 is 2500, 70\u00d75 is 350, 8\u00d75 is 40. Adding them up: 20000 + 2500 is 22500, plus 350 is 22850, plus 40 is 22890. Now, divide that by 4. 22890 divided by 4. \n\n22890 /4: 4 into 22 is 5, remainder 2. 4 into 28 (with the 2 carried over) is 7, 4 into 9 is 2 with remainder 1. 4 into 10 (with the 1 carried over) is 2, remainder 2. Hmm, maybe I should do this step by step. \n\nWait, 4 into 22 is 5, 5\u00d74=20, subtract 20, 22-20=2. Bring down the 8: 28. 4 into 28 is 7, 7\u00d74=28, subtract, no remainder. Bring down the 9. 4 into 9 is 2, 2\u00d74=8, subtract, remainder 1. Bring down the 0. 10. 4 into 10 is 2, 2\u00d74=8, remainder 2. Bring down the next 0 (since we can add a decimal point and zeros). 20. 4 into 20 is 5, 5\u00d74=20, no remainder. So putting it together: 5722.5. \n\nWait, but wait, the original calculation was 4578 \u00d7 5 = 22890, then divided by 4 is 5722.5. But looking at the options, I don't see 5722.5 as an option. Let me check the options again. \n\nThe options are A) 5050, B)5723, C)5040, D)4950, E)4870. Oh, option B is 5723. That's very close to 5722.5. So maybe the answer is B. But let me think again. Did I do the math correctly?\n\nWait, another approach: 20% discount means the customer pays 80%, so the original price is higher than Rs.4578. So the original price must be higher than 4578. The options given are A)5050, which is higher; B)5723, higher; C)5040, higher; D)4950, higher; E)4870, higher. So all options are higher than 4578, which makes sense.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculation. 4578 divided by 0.8. Let me compute 4578 / 0.8. \n\n0.8 \u00d7 5722 = 4577.6, which is close to 4578. So 0.8 \u00d7 5722.5 = 4578. So the original price is 5722.5, but since the options are in whole numbers, the closest would be 5723. So option B is the correct one.\n\nWait, but wait, let me calculate it more accurately. Let's do 4578 divided by 0.8.\n\n4578 \u00f7 0.8: \n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 10 to eliminate the decimal: 45780 \u00f7 8.\n\nNow, 8 \u00d7 5722 = 45776. Because 5722 \u00d78: 5000\u00d78=40000, 700\u00d78=5600, 22\u00d78=176. So 40000+5600=45600 +176=45776. \n\nSubtracting 45776 from 45780 gives 4. So 45780 \u00f78 is 5722 with a remainder of 4, which is 4/8 = 0.5. So 5722.5. So yes, the exact value is 5722.5.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a sale discount, and I need to figure out the actual selling price. Hmm, let me see. The problem says that there's a 20% discount on all articles, and Vinit bought one for Rs.4578. Wait, wait, no, wait a second. Wait, no, wait, the question is asking for the actual selling price. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the way the question is phrased might be a bit tricky. Let me read it again.\n\n\"In a sale, a discount of 20% was available on all the articles. If Vinit purchased an article for Rs.4578 in the sale. What was the actual selling price of the article?\"\n\nWait, so the discount is 20%, which means the customer pays 80% of the original price, right? Because 100% minus 20% is 80%. So if the article was sold for Rs.4578 after a 20% discount, then Rs.4578 is 80% of the actual selling price before the discount. Or wait, wait. No, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me clarify. So, the original selling price (let's call it SP) is the price before the discount. Then, the discounted price is what Vinit paid. So, the discounted price is 80% of the original SP. Because the discount is 20%, so 20% off means you pay 80% of the original.\n\nSo, the formula would be: Discounted Price = Original SP * (100% - Discount%). So in this case, 4578 = Original SP * 0.8.\n\nSo, to find the original SP, I need to divide 4578 by 0.8. Let me calculate that.\n\nWait, 4578 divided by 0.8. Let me think. 0.8 is the same as 4/5, right? So dividing by 4/5 is the same as multiplying by 5/4.\n\nSo, 4578 * (5/4). Let me compute that.\n\nLet me calculate 4578 * 5 first. 4578 *5: 4000*5 is 20000, 500*5=2500, 70*5=350, 8*5=40. So 20000+2500=22500, +350=22850, +40=22890.\n\nThen, 22890 divided by 4. Let me do that division. 22890 /4. 4 goes into 22 five times (5*4=20), remainder 2. Bring down 8: 28. 4 into 28 is 7, remainder 0. Bring down 9: 9/4 is 2 with remainder 1. Bring down 0: 10. 4 into 10 is 2, remainder 2. So the result is 5722.5? Wait, but 4578 *5 is 22890, and 22890 /4 is 5722.5. Hmm, but the options are all in whole numbers. Let me check the options.\n\nOptions are A) 5050, B)5723, C)5040, D)4950, E)4870.\n\nWait, 5722.5 is close to option B which is 5723. So that must be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nSo, 4578 divided by 0.8. Let's do it another way.\n\n4578 / 0.8 = (4578 * 10)/8 = 45780 /8.\n\nLet me compute 45780 divided by 8.\n\n8 into 45 is 5 (5*8=40), remainder 5. Bring down 7: 57. 8 into 57 is 7 (7*8=56), remainder 1. Bring down 8: 18. 8 into 18 is 2 (16), remainder 2. Bring down 0: 20. 8 into 20 is 2 (16), remainder 4. So the result is 5722.5. So yes, same as before.\n\nSo the original selling price is 5722.5, which isn't an option, but option B is 5723, which is the closest. Wait, but the options might be in whole numbers. So perhaps the calculation is correct, and the correct answer is option B.\n\nWait, but the question says, \"What was the actual selling price of the article?\" Wait, wait. Wait a second, no. Wait, the problem says that the discounted price is Rs.4578. So the actual selling price is the original, which is 5722.5. But the options don't have that. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me read the question again. Oh wait, perhaps I got it wrong. Maybe the question is asking for the selling price after discount, but that's what's given. No, the problem says that the article was purchased for Rs.4578 in the sale. So that's the discounted price. So the original price was higher, and the discounted price is 4578.\n\nSo the original selling price is 5722.5. But that's not one of the options. So maybe I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nThe discount is 20%, so the customer pays 80% of the original price. So, the selling price after discount is 80% of the original. So, 4578 = 0.8 * Original Price.\n\nSo, Original Price = 4578 /0.8 = 5722.5.\n\nBut looking at the options, option B is 5723, which is 5722.5 rounded up. So perhaps the correct answer is option B.\n\nWait, but another thought: maybe the question is phrased as the actual selling price. Wait, perhaps the actual selling price is the price after discount, which is 4578. But that can't be, because the options don't have 4578. So I'm confident that the correct approach is to compute the original price as 5722.5, which is option B when rounded.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me check all the options to see if any of them when multiplied by 0.8 gives 4578.\n\nOption A: 5050 *0.8=4040. That's not 4578.\n\nOption B:5723 *0.8= 4578.4. Hmm, that's close to 4578.4, which is a bit higher than 4578. So perhaps that's intended.\n\nOption C:5040 *0.8=4032, nope.\n\nOption D:4950 *0.8=3960. No.\n\nOption E:4870 *0.8=3896. No.\n\nSo only option B when multiplied by 0.8 gives a number close to 4578. So that must be the correct answer.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a sale discount, and I need to figure out the actual selling price. Hmm, let me see. The problem says that there's a 20% discount on all articles, and Vinit bought one for Rs.4578. Wait, wait, no, wait a second. Wait, no, wait, the question is asking for the actual selling price. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the way the question is phrased might be a bit tricky. Let me read it again.\n\n\"In a sale, a discount of 20% was available on all the articles. If Vinit purchased an article for Rs.4578 in the sale. What was the actual selling price of the article?\"\n\nWait, so the discount is 20%, which means the customer pays 80% of the original price, right? Because 100% minus 20% is 80%. So if the article was sold for Rs.4578 after a 20% discount, then Rs.4578 is 80% of the actual selling price before the discount. Or wait, wait. No, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me clarify. So, the original selling price (let's call it SP) is the price before the discount. Then, the discounted price is what Vinit paid. So, the discounted price is 80% of the original SP. Because the discount is 20%, so 20% off means you pay 80% of the original.\n\nSo, the formula would be: Discounted Price = Original SP * (100% - Discount%). So in this case, 4578 = Original SP * 0.8.\n\nSo, to find the original SP, I need to divide 4578 by 0.8. Let me calculate that.\n\nWait, 4578 divided by 0.8. Let me think. 0.8 is the same as 4/5, right? So dividing by 4/5 is the same as multiplying by 5/4.\n\nSo, 4578 * (5/4). Let me compute that.\n\nLet me calculate 4578 * 5 first. 4578 *5: 4000*5 is 20000, 500*5=2500, 70*5=350, 8*5=40. So 20000+2500=22500, +350=22850, +40=22890.\n\nThen, 22890 divided by 4. Let me do that division. 22890 /4. 4 goes into 22 five times (5*4=20), remainder 2. Bring down 8: 28. 4 into 28 is 7, remainder 0. Bring down 9: 9/4 is 2 with remainder 1. Bring down 0: 10. 4 into 10 is 2, remainder 2. So the result is 5722.5? Wait, but 4578 *5 is 22890, and 22890 /4 is 5722.5. Hmm, but the options are all in whole numbers. Let me check the options.\n\nOptions are A) 5050, B)5723, C)5040, D)4950, E)4870.\n\nWait, 5722.5 is close to option B which is 5723. So that must be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nSo, 4578 divided by 0.8. Let's do it another way.\n\n4578 / 0.8 = (4578 * 10)/8 = 45780 /8.\n\nLet me compute 45780 divided by 8.\n\n8 into 45 is 5 (5*8=40), remainder 5. Bring down 7: 57. 8 into 57 is 7 (7*8=56), remainder 1. Bring down 8: 18. 8 into 18 is 2 (16), remainder 2. Bring down 0: 20. 8 into 20 is 2 (16), remainder 4. So the result is 5722.5. So yes, same as before.\n\nSo the original selling price is 5722.5, which isn't an option, but option B is 5723, which is the closest. Wait, but the options might be in whole numbers. So perhaps the calculation is correct, and the correct answer is option B.\n\nWait, but the question says, \"What was the actual selling price of the article?\" Wait, wait. Wait a second, no. Wait, the problem says that the discounted price is Rs.4578. So the actual selling price is the original, which is 5722.5. But the options don't have that. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me read the question again. Oh wait, perhaps I got it wrong. Maybe the question is asking for the selling price after discount, but that's what's given. No, the problem says that the article was purchased for Rs.4578 in the sale. So that's the discounted price. So the original price was higher, and the discounted price is 4578.\n\nSo the original selling price is 5722.5. But that's not one of the options. So maybe I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nThe discount is 20%, so the customer pays 80% of the original price. So, the selling price after discount is 80% of the original. So, 4578 = 0.8 * Original Price.\n\nSo, Original Price = 4578 /0.8 = 5722.5.\n\nBut looking at the options, option B is 5723, which is 5722.5 rounded up. So perhaps the correct answer is option B.\n\nWait, but another thought: maybe the question is phrased as the actual selling price. Wait, perhaps the actual selling price is the price after discount, which is 4578. But that can't be, because the options don't have 4578. So I'm confident that the correct approach is to compute the original price as 5722.5, which is option B when rounded.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me check all the options to see if any of them when multiplied by 0.8 gives 4578.\n\nOption A: 5050 *0.8=4040. That's not 4578.\n\nOption B:5723 *0.8= 4578.4. Hmm, that's close to 4578.4, which is a bit higher than 4578. So perhaps that's intended.\n\nOption C:5040 *0.8=4032, nope.\n\nOption D:4950 *0.8=3960. No.\n\nOption E:4870 *0.8=3896. No.\n\nSo only option B when multiplied by 0.8 gives a number close to 4578. So that must be the correct answer.\n\n\nTo determine the actual selling price of the article before the discount, we start by noting that the discount is 20%, meaning the customer pays 80% of the original selling price. The discounted price paid by Vinit is Rs. 4578, which represents 80% of the original selling price. \n\nLet the original selling price be \\( SP \\). The relationship between the discounted price and the original selling price is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Discounted Price} = SP \\times 0.8\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given discounted price:\n\n\\[\n4578 = SP \\times 0.8\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( SP \\), we divide both sides by 0.8:\n\n\\[\nSP = \\frac{4578}{0.8}\n\\]\n\nPerforming the division:\n\n\\[\nSP = 4578 \\times \\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{4578 \\times 5}{4} = \\frac{22890}{4} = 5722.5\n\\]\n\nSince the options are in whole numbers, we round \\( 5722.5 \\) to the nearest whole number, which is \\( 5723 \\). To verify, we check if \\( 5723 \\times 0.8 \\) equals \\( 4578 \\):\n\n\\[\n5723 \\times 0.8 = 4578.4\n\\]\n\nThis is very close to \\( 4578 \\), confirming that the correct answer is \\( 5723 \\). Checking the other options, none of them satisfy the condition that \\( \\text{Option} \\times 0.8 = 4578 \\). Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: B",

Wait, the question says he purchased it for Rs.4578 after the discount. So that's the price he paid, which is the discounted price. I need to find the original selling price before the discount, right?\n\nOh right, because the discount is 20%, so the Rs.4578 is 80% of the original price. Because 100% minus 20% is 80%, so the discounted price is 80% of the original. So I can set up an equation where 80% of the original price equals 4578.\n\nLet me think about how to represent this mathematically. Let the actual selling price (the original, before discount) be x. Then 20% discount means he paid 80% of x. So:\n\n0.8 * x = 4578\n\nI need to solve for x. So x equals 4578 divided by 0.8. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 4578 divided by 0.8. Let me do this step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of 0.8 as 4/5. So dividing by 4/5 is the same as multiplying by 5/4. So 4578 * (5/4) = ?\n\nWait, 4578 multiplied by 5 is 22890, right? Let me check: 4578 *5. 4000*5 is 20,000. 500*5 is 2500, so 20,000+2500=22500. Then 78*5=390. So 22500+390=22890. Now, divide that by 4.\n\n22890 divided by 4. Let's see, 22890 /4. 4*5000 is 20,000. 22890-20000=2890. 2890/4 is 722.5. So total is 5000 + 722.5 = 5722.5. Hmm, but the options are all whole numbers.

So 4578 \u00f7 (4/5) = 4578 * (5/4) = (4578 *5)/4. So 4578 *5 is 22890. Divided by 4. Let me compute 22890 /4.\n\n4 into 22 is 5, 5*4=20, remainder 2. Bring down 8: 28. 4 into 28 is 7, 7*4=28, no remainder. Bring down 9: 9. 4 into 9 is 2, remainder 1. Bring down 0: 10. 4 into 10 is 2, remainder 2. So the division gives 5722.5.

The options are A)5050, B)5723, C)5040, D)4950, E)4870.\n\nWait, 5722.5 is approximately 5723. So option B is 5723, which would be the closest. So that must be the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me compute 4578 /0.8 again. Let's think in terms of percentages.\n\nIf 80% is 4578, then 10% would be 4578 /8 = 572.25. So 100% is 10 times that, which is 5722.5. Yep, same result.

The question is about a sale where there's a 20% discount on all articles. Vinit bought an article for Rs.4578, and I need to find out what the actual selling price was before the discount. Hmm, wait, actually, no, wait a second. Wait, the way the question is phrased, I think I might be getting confused. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Vinit purchased an article for Rs.4578 in the sale.\" Oh, right, because it's on sale with a 20% discount. So the Rs.4578 he paid is the discounted price. The question is asking for the actual selling price before the discount, right? Or wait, is it the original price? Or is it the marked price? Because sometimes these terms can be a bit tricky.\n\nWait, no, the actual selling price is what the customer paid, but here, the customer paid the discounted price. So maybe I'm getting the terms wrong. Let me clarify.\n\nIn a sale, when they say a discount is given, the actual selling price is the price after discount. But in this question, Vinit bought it for Rs.4578, which is the discounted price. So the original price was higher, and the discounted price is lower. So the question is asking, what was the original price before the discount?\n\nWait, wait. The options are A) 5050, B)5723, C)5040, D)4950, E)4870. So all these are higher than 4578, which makes sense because the selling price after discount would be lower than the original price.\n\nSo the formula I should use is: the discounted price is equal to the original price minus 20% of the original price. So mathematically, that would be:\n\nDiscounted Price = Original Price \u00d7 (1 - Discount Rate)\n\nHere, the discount rate is 20%, which is 0.20 as a decimal. So:\n\n4578 = Original Price \u00d7 (1 - 0.20)\n4578 = Original Price \u00d7 0.80\n\nTo find the original price, I can rearrange the formula:\n\nOriginal Price = 4578 / 0.80\n\nLet me compute that. So 4578 divided by 0.8. Hmm, 0.8 is the same as 4/5. So dividing by 4/5 is the same as multiplying by 5/4. So 4578 * (5/4) = ?\n\nLet me compute that step by step. 4578 divided by 4. Let's see: 4 into 4578. 4 into 4 is 1, 4 into 5 is 1 with remainder 1, 4 into 17 (after bringing down the 7) is 4*4=16, so 4 with remainder 1. Then bring down 8, 4 into 18 is 4, remainder 2. Wait, maybe I should just do it as 4578 *5 divided by 4.\n\nAlternatively, 4578 *5 is 22890. Then divide by 4. 22890 \u00f7 4.\n\n4 into 22 is 5, remainder 2. 4 into 28 is 7, remainder 0. 4 into 9 is 2, remainder 1. 4 into 10 is 2, remainder 2. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, let's do it properly. 22890 divided by 4.\n\nStart from the left: 4 into 2 is 0, but 4 into 22 is 5. 5 *4=20, subtract 22-20=2. Bring down 8: 28. 4 into 28 is 7. 7*4=28. Subtract, 0. Bring down 9: 09. 4 into 9 is 2, 2*4=8, subtract, 1. Bring down 0: 10. 4 into 10 is 2, 2*4=8, subtract, 2. So the number is 5722.5. Wait, that can't be right because 4578 is exact, so the original price should be a whole number.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation. Let me try again.\n\n4578 divided by 0.8 is equal to 4578 * (10/8) because 0.8 is 8/10, so dividing by 8/10 is multiplying by 10/8, which simplifies to 5/4. So 4578 *5/4.\n\n4578 multiplied by 5: let's compute that.\n\n4578 *5:\n\n8*5=40, write down 0, carryover 4.\n\n7*5=35, plus 4 is 39. Write down 9, carryover 3.\n\n5*5=25, plus 3 is 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n4*5=20, plus 2 is 22. Write down 22.\n\nSo 4578 *5 = 22890.\n\nNow divide 22890 by 4.\n\n22890 \u00f74: \n\n4 into 2 is 0, but let's take 22. 4*5=20, so 5. 22-20=2. Bring down 8: 28.\n\n4 into 28 is 7. 7*4=28. Subtract, 0. Bring down 9: 09.\n\n4 into 9 is 2, 2*4=8. Subtract 9-8=1. Bring down 0: 10.\n\n4 into 10 is 2, 2*4=8. 10-8=2. So the result is 5722 with a remainder of 2, which is 5722.5. Wait, but that's a fraction, and the options are all integers. So something's wrong here. Oh wait, perhaps I did the calculation wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the math another way.\n\nWait, perhaps the original price is 4578 divided by 0.8. Let's compute that.\n\n0.8 \u00d7 5000 = 4000. So 5000 would give a discounted price of 4000. But Vinit paid 4578, which is higher than 4000, so the original price must be higher than 5000. Hmm, but looking at the options, the highest is B)5723, which is about 5723.\n\nWait, 4578 divided by 0.8 is equal to 5722.5. Wait, that's 5722.5. But the options don't have that. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions are A)5050, B)5723, C)5040, D)4950, E)4870.\n\nHmm, option B is 5723, which is very close to 5722.5. So perhaps the correct answer is option B)5723.\n\nWait, but why is it 5723? Because 4578 divided by 0.8 is exactly 5722.5, but perhaps the options have rounded it up to the nearest rupee. So 5722.5 would round to 5723. So the correct answer would be B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me compute 4578 / 0.8.\n\n0.8 \u00d7 5722.5 = 4578? Let's check.\n\nCompute 5722.5 \u00d7 0.8.\n\n5722 \u00d7 0.8 is 4577.6.\n\n0.5 \u00d70.8 is 0.4.\n\nSo total is 4577.6 +0.4=4578. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the original price is 5722.5, but since prices are in whole rupees, perhaps they rounded it up to 5723.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B is 5723.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. The question is about a sale where there's a 20% discount on all articles. Vinit bought an article for Rs.4578, and I need to find out what the actual selling price was before the discount. Hmm, wait, actually, no, wait a second. Wait, the way the question is phrased, I think I might be getting confused. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Vinit purchased an article for Rs.4578 in the sale.\" Oh, right, because it's on sale with a 20% discount. So the Rs.4578 he paid is the discounted price. The question is asking for the actual selling price before the discount, right? Or wait, is it the original price? Or is it the marked price? Because sometimes these terms can be a bit tricky.\n\nWait, no, the actual selling price is what the customer paid, but here, the customer paid the discounted price. So maybe I'm getting the terms wrong. Let me clarify.\n\nIn a sale, when they say a discount is given, the actual selling price is the price after discount. But in this question, Vinit bought it for Rs.4578, which is the discounted price. So the original price was higher, and the discounted price is lower. So the question is asking, what was the original price before the discount?\n\nWait, wait. The options are A) 5050, B)5723, C)5040, D)4950, E)4870. So all these are higher than 4578, which makes sense because the selling price after discount would be lower than the original price.\n\nSo the formula I should use is: the discounted price is equal to the original price minus 20% of the original price. So mathematically, that would be:\n\nDiscounted Price = Original Price \u00d7 (1 - Discount Rate)\n\nHere, the discount rate is 20%, which is 0.20 as a decimal. So:\n\n4578 = Original Price \u00d7 (1 - 0.20)\n4578 = Original Price \u00d7 0.80\n\nTo find the original price, I can rearrange the formula:\n\nOriginal Price = 4578 / 0.80\n\nLet me compute that. So 4578 divided by 0.8. Hmm, 0.8 is the same as 4/5. So dividing by 4/5 is the same as multiplying by 5/4. So 4578 * (5/4) = ?\n\nLet me compute that step by step. 4578 divided by 4. Let's see: 4 into 4578. 4 into 4 is 1, 4 into 5 is 1 with remainder 1, 4 into 17 (after bringing down the 7) is 4*4=16, so 4 with remainder 1. Then bring down 8, 4 into 18 is 4, remainder 2. Wait, maybe I should just do it as 4578 *5 divided by 4.\n\nAlternatively, 4578 *5 is 22890. Then divide by 4. 22890 \u00f7 4.\n\n4 into 22 is 5, remainder 2. 4 into 28 is 7, remainder 0. 4 into 9 is 2, remainder 1. 4 into 10 is 2, remainder 2. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, let's do it properly. 22890 divided by 4.\n\nStart from the left: 4 into 2 is 0, but 4 into 22 is 5. 5 *4=20, subtract 22-20=2. Bring down 8: 28. 4 into 28 is 7. 7*4=28. Subtract, 0. Bring down 9: 09. 4 into 9 is 2, 2*4=8, subtract, 1. Bring down 0: 10. 4 into 10 is 2, 2*4=8, subtract, 2. So the number is 5722.5. Wait, that can't be right because 4578 is exact, so the original price should be a whole number.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation. Let me try again.\n\n4578 divided by 0.8 is equal to 4578 * (10/8) because 0.8 is 8/10, so dividing by 8/10 is multiplying by 10/8, which simplifies to 5/4. So 4578 *5/4.\n\n4578 multiplied by 5: let's compute that.\n\n4578 *5:\n\n8*5=40, write down 0, carryover 4.\n\n7*5=35, plus 4 is 39. Write down 9, carryover 3.\n\n5*5=25, plus 3 is 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n4*5=20, plus 2 is 22. Write down 22.\n\nSo 4578 *5 = 22890.\n\nNow divide 22890 by 4.\n\n22890 \u00f74: \n\n4 into 2 is 0, but let's take 22. 4*5=20, so 5. 22-20=2. Bring down 8: 28.\n\n4 into 28 is 7. 7*4=28. Subtract, 0. Bring down 9: 09.\n\n4 into 9 is 2, 2*4=8. Subtract 9-8=1. Bring down 0: 10.\n\n4 into 10 is 2, 2*4=8. 10-8=2. So the result is 5722 with a remainder of 2, which is 5722.5. Wait, but that's a fraction, and the options are all integers. So something's wrong here. Oh wait, perhaps I did the calculation wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the math another way.\n\nWait, perhaps the original price is 4578 divided by 0.8. Let's compute that.\n\n0.8 \u00d7 5000 = 4000. So 5000 would give a discounted price of 4000. But Vinit paid 4578, which is higher than 4000, so the original price must be higher than 5000. Hmm, but looking at the options, the highest is B)5723, which is about 5723.\n\nWait, 4578 divided by 0.8 is equal to 5722.5. Wait, that's 5722.5. But the options don't have that. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions are A)5050, B)5723, C)5040, D)4950, E)4870.\n\nHmm, option B is 5723, which is very close to 5722.5. So perhaps the correct answer is option B)5723.\n\nWait, but why is it 5723? Because 4578 divided by 0.8 is exactly 5722.5, but perhaps the options have rounded it up to the nearest rupee. So 5722.5 would round to 5723. So the correct answer would be B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me compute 4578 / 0.8.\n\n0.8 \u00d7 5722.5 = 4578? Let's check.\n\nCompute 5722.5 \u00d7 0.8.\n\n5722 \u00d7 0.8 is 4577.6.\n\n0.5 \u00d70.8 is 0.4.\n\nSo total is 4577.6 +0.4=4578. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the original price is 5722.5, but since prices are in whole rupees, perhaps they rounded it up to 5723.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B is 5723. So that must be the correct answer.\n\n\nTo determine the original price of the article before the 20% discount, we use the relationship between the discounted price and the original price.
