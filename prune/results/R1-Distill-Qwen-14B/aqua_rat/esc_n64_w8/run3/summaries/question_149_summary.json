      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where a merchant bought 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450 and sold them all at Rs. 7.50 per kg. I need to find the percentage gain. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my profit and loss calculations, but let me think through this.\n\nFirst, I remember that profit percentage is calculated based on the cost price. So, I need to find out the selling price and then figure out the profit, and then find what percentage that profit is of the cost.\n\nThe merchant bought 90 kg for Rs. 450. So the cost price per kg would be 450 divided by 90. Let me calculate that: 450 \u00f7 90 equals 5. So each kg cost him Rs. 5.\n\nHe sold each kg at Rs. 7.50. So the selling price per kg is 7.50. To find the total selling price, I multiply that by the number of kg, which is 90. Let me do that: 7.50 * 90. Hmm, 7.5 times 90. Well, 7 times 90 is 630, and 0.5 times 90 is 45, so adding those gives 630 + 45 = 675. So total selling price is Rs. 675.\n\nWait, so the cost was Rs. 450 and the selling price is Rs. 675. So the profit is selling price minus cost price. That's 675 - 450. Let me subtract: 675 minus 450 is 225. So he made a profit of Rs. 225.\n\nNow, to find the profit percentage. The formula is (Profit / Cost Price) * 100. So that's (225 / 450) * 100. Let me compute that. 225 divided by 450 is 0.5, and 0.5 times 100 is 50%. So the profit percentage is 50%.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 50%. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Cost per kg is 450/90=5, correct. Selling per kg is 7.5. So 7.5*90=675, correct. Profit is 675-450=225, correct. 225/450=0.5, which is 50%. Yep, that's right. So the correct answer is A) 50%.\n",

So I think that means the total cost is 450 rupees. Then he sold the whole lot at Rs. 7.50 per kg. I need to find out the percentage gain he made. \n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how much money he made from selling the oranges. Since he sold all 90 kg at 7.50 per kg, I'll multiply those two numbers together. Let me do that: 90 kg multiplied by 7.50 Rs/kg. \n\nWait, 90 times 7.5...

So first, I think I need to find out how much he spent per kilogram. Oh right, because that's the cost price per kg. So cost price per kg would be total cost divided by the quantity.

So he made a profit of Rs. 225.\n\nWait, let me make sure I did that right. 450 plus 225 is 675, which matches the selling price. Okay, that makes sense.\n\nSo the profit is 225, and the cost price is 450. Now, to find the percentage gain, I use the formula. So (225 / 450) * 100. Let's compute that. 225 divided by 450 is 0.5. Multiply by 100 gives 50%.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 50%. So that must be the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check everything. Cost price per kg is 5, sold at 7.5. So per kg profit is 2.5. For 90 kg, total profit is 2.5 *90=225. Yep, that's correct. So profit percentage is (225 /450)*100=50%. Yep, that's definitely right. So the answer should be A)50%.\n\n\nThe merchant purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450, making the cost price per kg Rs. 5. The oranges were sold at Rs. 7.50 per kg, so the total selling price for 90 kg is \\( 90 \\times 7.50 = 675 \\). The profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price: \\( 675 - 450 = 225 \\). The percentage gain is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Gain} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Profit}}{\\text{Cost Price}} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{225}{450} \\right) \\times 100 = 50\\%.\n\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is **A) 50%**.\n\nAnswer: A",

I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of problems, but I'll take it slow.\n\nAlright, the merchant bought 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450. So first, I think I need to find out how much he spent per kilogram. Wait, no, maybe not. Let's see, he bought 90 kg for 450 total. So his cost per kg would be 450 divided by 90, right? Let me calculate that. 450 divided by 90 is 5. So he bought each kg for Rs. 5.\n\nNow, he sold the whole lot at Rs. 7.50 per kg. So he sold each kg for 7.50. Hmm, so I need to find the profit he made and then calculate the percentage gain based on his cost.\n\nWait, the total cost was 450 Rs. And the selling price would be the number of kg multiplied by the selling price per kg. So that's 90 kg multiplied by 7.50 Rs/kg. Let me compute that. 90 times 7 is 630, and 90 times 0.5 is 45. So 630 plus 45 is 675. So he sold all the oranges for 675 Rs.\n\nSo the total cost is 450, total selling price is 675. The profit would be the selling price minus the cost price. So 675 minus 450 equals 225. So he made a profit of 225 Rs.\n\nNow, to find the percentage gain, I think the formula is (Profit / Cost Price) multiplied by 100. So that's (225 / 450) * 100. Let's calculate that. 225 divided by 450 is 0.5. Multiply by 100, that's 50%. So the percentage gain is 50%.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So he bought for 450, sold for 675.
