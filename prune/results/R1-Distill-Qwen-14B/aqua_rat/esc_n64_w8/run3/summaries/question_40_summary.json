      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about an aeroplane flying around a square field. The plane flies each side at different speeds: 200, 400, 600, and 800 km/hr. I need to find the average speed for the entire trip around the field. Hmm, average speed can be a bit tricky, but I remember it's total distance divided by total time, right?\n\nWait, the field is a square, so all four sides are equal in length. Let me denote each side as 's' kilometers. So the total distance the plane travels is 4 times s, or 4s.\n\nNow, I need to find the time taken for each side. Time is distance divided by speed. So for each side:\n\n- First side: time1 = s / 200\n- Second side: time2 = s / 400\n- Third side: time3 = s / 600\n- Fourth side: time4 = s / 800\n\nThe total time is the sum of these four times. Let me add them up.\n\nTotal time = (s/200) + (s/400) + (s/600) + (s/800)\n\nHmm, I can factor out s, so it's s multiplied by (1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800). Let me compute the sum inside the parentheses.\n\nTo add these fractions, I'll find a common denominator. The denominators are 200, 400, 600, 800. Let me see, 800 is the largest. Wait, 200 divides into 800 four times, 400 divides into 800 twice, 600 doesn't divide evenly into 800. Wait, maybe 2400 is a common multiple. Let's check: 2400/200 = 12, 2400/400=6, 2400/600=4, 2400/800=3. So yes, 2400 is a common denominator.\n\nSo converting each term:\n1/200 = 12/2400\n1/400 = 6/2400\n1/600 = 4/2400\n1/800 = 3/2400\n\nAdding them together: 12 +6 is 18, +4 is 22, +3 is 25. So total is 25/2400.\n\nSo the total time is s * (25/2400) = (25s) / 2400.\n\nWait, simplifying that, 25/2400 is 5/480, which is 1/96. So 25s/2400 is s/96? Wait, 25/2400 is 1/96. Because 2400 divided by 25 is 96. So yes, total time is s/96.\n\nWait, wait a second, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me double-check that calculation. Because 25 divided by 2400 is 0.0104166667. Hmm, but I think it's correct because each term adds up correctly.\n\nSo, the total time is (25s)/2400, which simplifies to s/96, since 25 * 96 = 2400.\n\nWait, no, wait: 25 times 96 is 2400. So 25/2400 is 1/96. So yes, total time is s/96.\n\nWait, no, wait: 2400 divided by 25 is 96, so 25/2400 is 1/96. So total time is s * (25/2400) = s/96.\n\nWait, but that seems off because the speeds are different, but maybe it's correct. Let's proceed.\n\nThe total distance is 4s. So average speed is total distance divided by total time.\n\nAverage speed = (4s) / (s/96) )\n\nWait, s cancels out. So 4s divided by (s/96) is 4 * (96) = 384 km/hr.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because the average speed is 384, which is option A. But wait, I'm a bit confused because when you have varying speeds, the average speed isn't just the arithmetic mean. Oh right, it's the harmonic mean when the distances are equal.\n\nWait, another approach: since each side is equal distance, the average speed is the harmonic mean of the four speeds. But harmonic mean for four speeds is 4/(1/v1 + 1/v2 + 1/v3 + 1/v4). Wait, no, wait. Actually, for equal distances, the average speed is the harmonic mean. But wait, the formula for average speed when each segment has the same distance is the harmonic mean of the speeds, but the way to compute it is total distance divided by total time, which is what I did earlier.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me re-calculate the sum inside the parentheses.\n\n1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800.\n\nLet me compute each term as decimals to see:\n\n1/200 = 0.005\n\n1/400 = 0.0025\n\n1/600 \u2248 0.0016666667\n\n1/800 = 0.00125\n\nAdding them: 0.005 + 0.0025 = 0.0075; plus 0.0016666667 is about 0.0091666667; plus 0.00125 is 0.0104166667.\n\nSo 0.0104166667. That's the sum of reciprocals.\n\nSo total time is s multiplied by 0.0104166667, which is s * 0.0104166667 = s * (1/96) because 1/96 \u2248 0.0104166667. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo total time is s/96. Total distance is 4s.\n\nSo average speed is (4s) / (s/96) ) = 4 * 96 = 384 km/h. So the answer is option A, 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when the speeds are in a sequence like 200, 400, 600, 800, the average speed isn't just the arithmetic mean. So maybe 384 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of it as the harmonic mean. The harmonic mean of four speeds is given by 4/(1/v1 + 1/v2 + 1/v3 + 1/v4).\n\nWait, but I think in this case, the average speed is (4 * s) / (s/96) ) = 4 * 96 = 384. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be A) 384.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an airplane flying around a square field. The question is asking for the average speed. Hmm, average speed can be tricky because it's not just the average of the speeds; it's total distance divided by total time. Right, I remember that from my studies.\n\nSo, the airplane flies along the four sides of a square, which means each side is equal in length. Let's denote the length of each side as 's' kilometers. Since it's a square, the total distance around the field would be 4 times s, so 4s km.\n\nNow, the plane flies each side at different speeds: 200, 400, 600, and 800 km/hr. Wait, so each side is a different speed? So, the time taken for each side will vary. I need to calculate the time taken for each side and then sum them up to get the total time.\n\nTime is calculated as distance divided by speed. So for each side, time t1 = s/200, t2 = s/400, t3 = s/600, and t4 = s/800. Let me write that down.\n\nSo total time T = t1 + t2 + t3 + t4 = s/200 + s/400 + s/600 + s/800. I can factor out s since it's common. So T = s (1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800).\n\nI need to compute that sum inside the parentheses. Let's calculate each term:\n\n1/200 is 0.005,\n1/400 is 0.0025,\n1/600 is approximately 0.0016667,\n1/800 is 0.00125.\n\nAdding them up: 0.005 + 0.0025 is 0.0075. Then 0.0075 + 0.0016667 is about 0.0091667. Adding 0.00125 gives 0.0104167.\n\nWait, maybe I should find a common denominator to add them exactly. Let's see. The denominators are 200, 400, 600, 800. Let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. 200 factors into 2^3 * 5^2. 400 is 2^4 *5^2. 600 is 2^3 *3 *5^2. 800 is 2^5 *5^2. So the LCM would be 2^5 *3 *5^2 = 32 *3 *25 = 32*75=2400.\n\nSo converting each fraction:\n\n1/200 = 12/2400,\n\n1/400 = 6/2400,\n\n1/600 = 4/2400,\n\n1/800 = 3/2400.\n\nAdding them: 12 +6 is 18, plus 4 is 22, plus 3 is 25. So total is 25/2400. So 25/2400 is the sum of the times.\n\nSo T = s * (25/2400) = (25s) / 2400.\n\nWait, but 25/2400 can be simplified. 25 and 2400, both divided by 5: 5/480. So 5/(480) = s/(96s) ? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Because T = s * (25/2400) = (25 s) / 2400. Alternatively, that's s multiplied by 25/2400, which is s*(5/480) = s/(96). Wait, 5/480 is 1/96, because 480/5 is 96. So yes, 25/2400 = 5/480 = 1/96. So T = s * (1/96) = s/96.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me recheck the fractions:\n\nWait, 200 is 200, 400 is 400, etc. So 1/200 is 12/2400, yes, because 2400 /200=12. 400 is 2400/400=6, so 1/400 is 6/2400. 600: 2400/600=4, so 4/2400. 800: 2400/800=3, so 3/2400. So 12+6+4+3=25. So sum is 25/2400. So T = s*(25/2400) = (25 s)/(2400). Simplify 25 and 2400: both divided by 25 gives 1 and 96. So (25 s)/(2400) = s/(96). So T = s/96.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit odd. Because 200 is the slowest speed, so the time for that side would be the largest. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, 1/200 = 0.005, 1/400=0.0025, 1/600\u22480.0016667, 1/800=0.00125.\n\nAdding them: 0.005 + 0.0025 = 0.0075; plus 0.0016667 gives ~0.0091667; plus 0.00125 gives ~0.0104167. So 0.0104167 is the sum. Let me compute 25/2400 as a decimal: 25 divided by 2400. 2400 \u00f725 is 96, so 25/2400 is 1/96 \u22480.0104167. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo T = s / 96. So the total time is s/96 hours.\n\nThe total distance is 4s. So average speed is total distance divided by total time.\n\nAverage speed V_avg = (4s) / (s/96) ) = 4s * (96/s) )= 4 *96 = 384 km/hr.\n\nWait, that's option A)384.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The problem says \"around the field,\" so it's a closed path, so the average speed is total distance over total time. So yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit surprised because the average isn't just the arithmetic mean of the speeds. Instead, because the time spent at each speed varies, it's a harmonic mean situation. But for multiple speeds and equal distances, the average speed is the harmonic mean of the speeds.\n\nWait, the formula for average speed when equal distances are covered at different speeds is the harmonic mean. For n speeds, it's n divided by the sum of reciprocals. But in this case, since each side is the same distance, the average speed is the harmonic mean of the four speeds.\n\nWait, harmonic mean formula for four speeds v1, v2, v3, v4 is 4/(1/v1 + 1/v2 + 1/v3 +1/v4).\n\nWait, but in our calculation, we found that the total time is s*(1/200 +1/400 +1/600 +1/800). So the average speed is (4s) / [s(1/200 +1/400 +1/600 +1/800)} ].\n\nThe s cancels, so it becomes 4 / (1/200 +1/400 +1/600 +1/800) = 4/(25/2400) )=4*(2400/25) )=4*(96) )= 384 km/h. So that matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo the correct answer is 384, which is option A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an airplane flying around a square field. The question is asking for the average speed. Hmm, average speed can be tricky because it's not just the average of the speeds; it's total distance divided by total time. Right, I remember that from my studies.\n\nSo, the airplane flies along the four sides of a square, which means each side is equal in length. Let's denote the length of each side as 's' kilometers. Since it's a square, the total distance around the field would be 4 times s, so 4s km.\n\nNow, the plane flies each side at different speeds: 200, 400, 600, and 800 km/hr. Wait, so each side is a different speed? So, the time taken for each side will vary. I need to calculate the time taken for each side and then sum them up to get the total time.\n\nTime is calculated as distance divided by speed. So for each side, time t1 = s/200, t2 = s/400, t3 = s/600, and t4 = s/800. Let me write that down.\n\nSo total time T = t1 + t2 + t3 + t4 = s/200 + s/400 + s/600 + s/800. I can factor out s since it's common. So T = s (1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800).\n\nI need to compute that sum inside the parentheses. Let's calculate each term:\n\n1/200 is 0.005,\n1/400 is 0.0025,\n1/600 is approximately 0.0016667,\n1/800 is 0.00125.\n\nAdding them up: 0.005 + 0.0025 is 0.0075. Then 0.0075 + 0.0016667 is about 0.0091667. Adding 0.00125 gives 0.0104167.\n\nWait, maybe I should find a common denominator to add them exactly. Let's see. The denominators are 200, 400, 600, 800. Let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. 200 factors into 2^3 * 5^2. 400 is 2^4 *5^2. 600 is 2^3 *3 *5^2. 800 is 2^5 *5^2. So the LCM would be 2^5 *3 *5^2 = 32 *3 *25 = 32*75=2400.\n\nSo converting each fraction:\n\n1/200 = 12/2400,\n\n1/400 = 6/2400,\n\n1/600 = 4/2400,\n\n1/800 = 3/2400.\n\nAdding them: 12 +6 is 18, plus 4 is 22, plus 3 is 25. So total is 25/2400. So 25/2400 is the sum of the times.\n\nSo T = s * (25/2400) = (25s) / 2400.\n\nWait, but 25/2400 can be simplified. 25 and 2400, both divided by 5: 5/480. So 5/(480) = s/(96s) ? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Because T = s * (25/2400) = (25 s) / 2400. Alternatively, that's s multiplied by 25/2400, which is s*(5/480) = s/(96). Wait, 5/480 is 1/96, because 480/5 is 96. So yes, 25/2400 = 5/480 = 1/96. So T = s * (1/96) = s/96.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me recheck the fractions:\n\nWait, 200 is 200, 400 is 400, etc. So 1/200 is 12/2400, yes, because 2400 /200=12. 400 is 2400/400=6, so 1/400 is 6/2400. 600: 2400/600=4, so 4/2400. 800: 2400/800=3, so 3/2400. So 12+6+4+3=25. So sum is 25/2400. So T = s*(25/2400) = (25 s)/(2400). Simplify 25 and 2400: both divided by 25 gives 1 and 96. So (25 s)/(2400) = s/(96). So T = s/96.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit odd. Because 200 is the slowest speed, so the time for that side would be the largest. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, 1/200 = 0.005, 1/400=0.0025, 1/600\u22480.0016667, 1/800=0.00125.\n\nAdding them: 0.005 + 0.0025 = 0.0075; plus 0.0016667 gives ~0.0091667; plus 0.00125 gives ~0.0104167. So 0.0104167 is the sum. Let me compute 25/2400 as a decimal: 25 divided by 2400. 2400 \u00f725 is 96, so 25/2400 is 1/96 \u22480.0104167. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo T = s / 96. So the total time is s/96 hours.\n\nThe total distance is 4s. So average speed is total distance divided by total time.\n\nAverage speed V_avg = (4s) / (s/96) ) = 4s * (96/s) )= 4 *96 = 384 km/hr.\n\nWait, that's option A)384.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The problem says \"around the field,\" so it's a closed path, so the average speed is total distance over total time. So yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit surprised because the average isn't just the arithmetic mean of the speeds. Instead, because the time spent at each speed varies, it's a harmonic mean situation. But for multiple speeds and equal distances, the average speed is the harmonic mean of the speeds.\n\nWait, the formula for average speed when equal distances are covered at different speeds is the harmonic mean. For n speeds, it's n divided by the sum of reciprocals. But in this case, since each side is the same distance, the average speed is the harmonic mean of the four speeds.\n\nWait, harmonic mean formula for four speeds v1, v2, v3, v4 is 4/(1/v1 + 1/v2 + 1/v3 +1/v4).\n\nWait, but in our calculation, we found that the total time is s*(1/200 +1/400 +1/600 +1/800). So the average speed is (4s) / [s(1/200 +1/400 +1/600 +1/800)} ].\n\nThe s cancels, so it becomes 4 / (1/200 +1/400 +1/600 +1/800) = 4/(25/2400) )=4*(2400/25) )=4*(96) )= 384 km/h. So that matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo the correct answer is 384, which is option A.\n\n\nTo determine the average speed of the airplane flying around the square field, we use the formula for average speed, which is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.\n\n### Step 1: Total Distance\nThe airplane flies along the four sides of a square, so each side has the same length.

The speeds on each side are different: 200, 400, 600, and 800 km/hr. And I need to find the average speed for the entire trip around the field. Oh wait, average speed, not average velocity. Because it's a square, the displacement would be zero if it ends where it starts, but average speed is total distance over total time. Yeah, I remember that.\n\nSo, first, I should probably figure out the total distance the plane travels. Since it's a square, each side is the same length. Let me call each side 's'. So the perimeter is 4s. But since I don't know the actual length of each side, maybe I don't need to know 's' because it might cancel out. Let's think about that.\n\nThe plane goes around the square, so it covers each side once. The time taken for each side would be distance divided by speed. So for each side, the time is s divided by the speed for that side. Then, the total time would be the sum of the times for each side.\n\nWait, but all sides are equal in length since it's a square. So each side is length 's', so the total distance is 4s. But the total time would be s/200 + s/400 + s/600 + s/800. Oh right, because each side is at a different speed.\n\nSo, the average speed is total distance divided by total time. Let's write that down:\n\nAverage speed = (4s) / [ (s/200) + (s/400) + (s/600) + (s/800) ) ]\n\nHmm, I can factor out 's' from the denominator. Let's see:\n\nDenominator becomes s [ (1/200) + (1/400) + (1/600) + (1/800) ) ]\n\nSo the 's' in numerator and denominator will cancel out.

Thus, the total time is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total time} = \\frac{s}{200} + \\frac{s}{400} + \\frac{s}{600} + \\frac{s}{800}\n\\]\n\nFactoring out \\( s \\) from the denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total time} = s \\left( \\frac{1}{200} + \\frac{1}{400} + \\frac{1}{600} + \\frac{1}{800} \\right)\n\\]\n\nThe average speed becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average speed} = \\frac{4s}{s \\left( \\frac{1}{200} + \\frac{1}{400} + \\frac{1}{600} + \\frac{1}{800} \\right)} = \\frac{4}{\\left( \\frac{1}{200} + \\frac{1}{400} + \\frac{1}{600} + \\frac{1}{800} \\right)}\n\\]\n\nNext, calculate the sum in the denominator. To add the fractions, find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 200, 400, 600, and 800 is 2400. Converting each term:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{200} = \\frac{12}{2400}, \\quad \\frac{1}{400} = \\frac{6}{2400}, \\quad \\frac{1}{600} = \\frac{4}{2400}, \\quad \\frac{1}{800} = \\frac{3}{2400}\n\\]\n\nAdding these:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{2400} + \\frac{6}{2400} + \\frac{4}{2400} + \\frac{3}{2400} = \\frac{25}{2400}\n\\]\n\nThus, the denominator is \\( \\frac{25}{2400} \\).

I need to find the average speed around the field. Hmm, average speed can be a bit tricky because it's not just the average of the speeds; it's total distance divided by total time. Right.\n\nWait, let's think. The plane is going around a square, so each side is the same length, right? Let's say the length of each side is 's' kilometers. So the total distance the plane travels is 4s.\n\nBut the speeds are different for each side. So the time taken for each side would vary. To find the total time, I need to calculate the time for each leg and add them up.\n\nTime is distance divided by speed. So for each side, the time would be s/200, s/400, s/600, and s/800. Let me write that down:\n\nTime1 = s/200\nTime2 = s/400\nTime3 = s/600\nTime4 = s/800\n\nTotal time T = (s/200) + (s/400) + (s/600) + (s/800)\n\nI can factor out s from each term, so T = s*(1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800)\n\nLet me compute the sum inside the parentheses.

Alternatively, the least common multiple (LCM) of 200, 400, 600, 800.\n\nWait, 200 factors into 2^3 * 5^2. 400 is 2^4 *5^2. 600 is 2^3*3*5^2. 800 is 2^5 *5^2. So the LCM would take the highest exponents from each. So 2^5, 3^1, and 5^2. So LCM is 32 *3 *25 = 32 *75 = 2400.\n\nSo converting each fraction to have denominator 2400:\n\n1/200 = 12/2400\n1/400 = 6/2400\n1/600 = 4/2400\n1/800 = 3/2400\n\nAdding them up: 12 +6 +4 +3 =25.

Yeah, that's correct.\n\nNow, the average speed is total distance divided by total time. Total distance is 4s, total time is (25s)/(2400).\n\nSo average speed V_avg = (4s) / (25s/2400) )\n\nThe s cancels out, so V_avg = 4 * (2400/25) )\n\nCalculate that: 4 * (2400/25) = (4*2400)/25 = 9600 /25.\n\nHmm, what's 9600 divided by 25? Let me compute.\n\n25 * 384 = 9600 (because 25*400=10000, which is 400 more than 9600. So 25*(400-384)=25*16=400, so 25*384=9600).\n\nSo V_avg = 384 km/hr.\n\nWait, but let me check again. 25/2400 is the sum. So the time is (s * 25)/2400. The distance is 4s. So average speed is 4s / ( (25s)/2400 ) ) = 4s * (2400)/(25s) )= (4*2400)/(25) )= 9600/25 = 384. So yes.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 384. So the answer should be A.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the average speed of an aeroplane that's flying around the four sides of a square. Hmm, the speeds given are 200, 400, 600, and 800 km/hr. I remember that average speed is total distance divided by total time, right? So I can't just take the average of the speeds; I need to calculate the total distance the plane travels and the total time it takes.\n\nWait, the plane is flying along the four sides of a square. So each side is the same length. Let me denote the length of each side as 's'. That means the total distance around the square is 4s. But I don't know the actual value of 's', but maybe it'll cancel out in the calculations.\n\nSo, for each side, the plane is moving at a different speed. Let's break it down:\n\n1. First side: speed = 200 km/hr, distance = s\n2. Second side: speed = 400 km/hr, distance = s\n3. Third side: speed = 600 km/hr, distance = s\n4. Fourth side: speed = 800 km/hr, distance = s\n\nWait a second, but the problem says the plane is flying along the four sides. Oh, wait, does that mean it's going around the square once, so four sides? So total distance is 4s.\n\nNow, I need to find the time taken for each side and sum them up. Time is distance divided by speed. So for each side:\n\nTime1 = s / 200\nTime2 = s / 400\nTime3 = s / 600\nTime4 = s / 800\n\nTotal time is the sum of these four. Let me write that as:\n\nTotal time = (s/200) + (s/400) + (s/600) + (s/800)\n\nI can factor out 's' from each term:\n\nTotal time = s * [1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800]\n\nNow, to compute the sum inside the brackets. Let me find a common denominator. The denominators are 200, 400, 600, 800. Let me see, the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. Let's think:\n\n200 factors into 2^3 *5^2.\n400 is 2^4 *5^2.\n600 is 2^3 *3*5^2.\n800 is 2^5 *5^2.\n\nThe LCM would take the highest exponents: 2^5 and 5^2. So LCM is 32 * 25 = 800.\n\nSo converting each fraction to have 800 as the denominator:\n\n1/200 = 4/800\n1/400 = 2/800\n1/600 = (800/600)=1.333... \u2192 wait, 600 is 600, so 800 /600 = 4/3. So 1/600 = (4/3)/800 \u2192 wait, maybe it's easier to compute each term as:\n\n1/200 = 4/800\n1/400 = 2/800\n1/600 = (800/600)=1.333 \u2192 no, wait, 600 goes into 800 how many times? 800 \u00f7 600 is 4/3. So 1/600 is (4/3)/800. Wait, maybe I should compute each fraction as over 800:\n\n1/200 = 4/800\n1/400 = 2/800\n1/600 = (800/600) = 4/3 * (1/800) \u2192 wait, no, 1/600 = (800 \u00f7 600) \u2192 4/3 * (1/800) \u2192 wait, no, that's not right. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, 1/600 = (800/600) * (1/800) \u2192 but that would be (4/3) * (1/800) = 4/(3*800) = 4/2400 = 1/600. Wait, maybe I'm complicating this.\n\nLet me compute each term's numerator when denominator is 800:\n\n1/200 = 4/800 (because 200 *4=800)\n1/400 = 2/800\n1/600 = (800/600) \u2192 800/600 is 4/3. So 1/600 = (4/3)/800? Wait, no, because 1/600 = x/800 \u2192 x = 800/600 = 4/3. So 1/600 = (4/3)/800.\n\nWait, but that might not help. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute each fraction and sum them:\n\n1/200 = 0.005\n1/400 = 0.0025\n1/600 \u2248 0.0016667\n1/800 = 0.00125\n\nAdding these together: 0.005 + 0.0025 = 0.0075; plus 0.0016667 gives 0.0091667; plus 0.00125 gives 0.0104167.\n\nSo the sum is approximately 0.0104167.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute it as fractions. Let me try that.\n\n1/200 + 1/400 = (2 + 1)/400 = 3/400.\n\n3/400 + 1/600: Let's find a common denominator for 400 and 600. 400 = 2^4 *5^2, 600=2^3 *3 *5^2. LCM is 2^4 *3 *5^2 = 16 *3 *25 = 1200.\n\nSo 3/400 = 9/1200; 1/600 = 2/1200. Sum is 11/1200.\n\nNow, 11/1200 + 1/800: Let's find LCM of 1200 and 800.\n\n1200 = 2^4 *3 *5^2\n800 = 2^5 *5^2\nLCM is 2^5 *3 *5^2 = 32 *3 *25 = 2400.\n\nSo 11/1200 = 22/2400, and 1/800 = 3/2400. Sum is 25/2400 = 5/480 = 1/96.\n\nSo the total time is s * (1/96). Wait, that can't be right because the sum of the reciprocals is 1/96. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, 1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 +1/800 = ?\n\nLet me compute each as fractions with denominator 2400.\n\n1/200 = 12/2400\n1/400 = 6/2400\n1/600 =4/2400\n1/800=3/2400\n\nAdding them: 12 +6 +4 +3 =25 \u2192 25/2400 = 5/480 = 1/96.\n\nOh, right. So total time is s*(1/96) \u2192 s/96 hours.\n\nWait, but wait, that's the sum of (1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800) equals 1/96. So total time is s*(1/96) = s/96.\n\nWait, but the total distance is 4s. So average speed is total distance divided by total time.\n\nAverage speed = (4s) / (s/96) )\n\nSimplify: 4s * (96/s) ) \u2192 4 *96 = 384.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 4 times 96 is 384.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the average speed of an aeroplane that's flying around the four sides of a square. Hmm, the speeds given are 200, 400, 600, and 800 km/hr. I remember that average speed is total distance divided by total time, right? So I can't just take the average of the speeds; I need to calculate the total distance the plane travels and the total time it takes.\n\nWait, the plane is flying along the four sides of a square. So each side is the same length. Let me denote the length of each side as 's'. That means the total distance around the square is 4s. But I don't know the actual value of 's', but maybe it'll cancel out in the calculations.\n\nSo, for each side, the plane is moving at a different speed. Let's break it down:\n\n1. First side: speed = 200 km/hr, distance = s\n2. Second side: speed = 400 km/hr, distance = s\n3. Third side: speed = 600 km/hr, distance = s\n4. Fourth side: speed = 800 km/hr, distance = s\n\nWait a second, but the problem says the plane is flying along the four sides. Oh, wait, does that mean it's going around the square once, so four sides? So total distance is 4s.\n\nNow, I need to find the time taken for each side and sum them up. Time is distance divided by speed. So for each side:\n\nTime1 = s / 200\nTime2 = s / 400\nTime3 = s / 600\nTime4 = s / 800\n\nTotal time is the sum of these four. Let me write that as:\n\nTotal time = (s/200) + (s/400) + (s/600) + (s/800)\n\nI can factor out 's' from each term:\n\nTotal time = s * [1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800]\n\nNow, to compute the sum inside the brackets. Let me find a common denominator. The denominators are 200, 400, 600, 800. Let me see, the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. Let's think:\n\n200 factors into 2^3 *5^2.\n400 is 2^4 *5^2.\n600 is 2^3 *3*5^2.\n800 is 2^5 *5^2.\n\nThe LCM would take the highest exponents: 2^5 and 5^2. So LCM is 32 * 25 = 800.\n\nSo converting each fraction to have 800 as the denominator:\n\n1/200 = 4/800\n1/400 = 2/800\n1/600 = (800/600)=1.333... \u2192 wait, 600 is 600, so 800 /600 = 4/3. So 1/600 = (4/3)/800 \u2192 wait, maybe it's easier to compute each term as:\n\n1/200 = 4/800\n1/400 = 2/800\n1/600 = (800/600)=1.333 \u2192 no, wait, 600 goes into 800 how many times? 800 \u00f7 600 is 4/3. So 1/600 is (4/3)/800. Wait, maybe I should compute each fraction as over 800:\n\n1/200 = 4/800\n1/400 = 2/800\n1/600 = (800/600) = 4/3 * (1/800) \u2192 wait, no, 1/600 = (800 \u00f7 600) \u2192 4/3 * (1/800) \u2192 wait, no, that's not right. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, 1/600 = (800/600) * (1/800) \u2192 but that would be (4/3) * (1/800) = 4/(3*800) = 4/2400 = 1/600. Wait, maybe I'm complicating this.\n\nLet me compute each term's numerator when denominator is 800:\n\n1/200 = 4/800 (because 200 *4=800)\n1/400 = 2/800\n1/600 = (800/600) \u2192 800/600 is 4/3. So 1/600 = (4/3)/800? Wait, no, because 1/600 = x/800 \u2192 x = 800/600 = 4/3. So 1/600 = (4/3)/800.\n\nWait, but that might not help. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute each fraction and sum them:\n\n1/200 = 0.005\n1/400 = 0.0025\n1/600 \u2248 0.0016667\n1/800 = 0.00125\n\nAdding these together: 0.005 + 0.0025 = 0.0075; plus 0.0016667 gives 0.0091667; plus 0.00125 gives 0.0104167.\n\nSo the sum is approximately 0.0104167.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute it as fractions. Let me try that.\n\n1/200 + 1/400 = (2 + 1)/400 = 3/400.\n\n3/400 + 1/600: Let's find a common denominator for 400 and 600. 400 = 2^4 *5^2, 600=2^3 *3 *5^2. LCM is 2^4 *3 *5^2 = 16 *3 *25 = 1200.\n\nSo 3/400 = 9/1200; 1/600 = 2/1200. Sum is 11/1200.\n\nNow, 11/1200 + 1/800: Let's find LCM of 1200 and 800.\n\n1200 = 2^4 *3 *5^2\n800 = 2^5 *5^2\nLCM is 2^5 *3 *5^2 = 32 *3 *25 = 2400.\n\nSo 11/1200 = 22/2400, and 1/800 = 3/2400. Sum is 25/2400 = 5/480 = 1/96.\n\nSo the total time is s * (1/96). Wait, that can't be right because the sum of the reciprocals is 1/96. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, 1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 +1/800 = ?\n\nLet me compute each as fractions with denominator 2400.\n\n1/200 = 12/2400\n1/400 = 6/2400\n1/600 =4/2400\n1/800=3/2400\n\nAdding them: 12 +6 +4 +3 =25 \u2192 25/2400 = 5/480 = 1/96.\n\nOh, right. So total time is s*(1/96) \u2192 s/96 hours.\n\nWait, but wait, that's the sum of (1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800) equals 1/96. So total time is s*(1/96) = s/96.\n\nWait, but the total distance is 4s. So average speed is total distance divided by total time.\n\nAverage speed = (4s) / (s/96) )\n\nSimplify: 4s * (96/s) ) \u2192 4 *96 = 384.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 4 times 96 is 384. So the average speed is 384 km/h.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A is 384. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes when dealing with reciprocals, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nWait, the sum of the reciprocals:\n\n1/200 = 0.005\n1/400 = 0.0025\n1/600 \u2248 0.001666667\n1/800 = 0.00125\n\nAdding them: 0.005 + 0.0025 = 0.0075; + 0.001666667 = 0.009166667; + 0.00125 = 0.010416667.\n\nSo sum is approximately 0.010416667.\n\nSo total time = s * 0.010416667.\n\nTotal distance is 4s.\n\nAverage speed = 4s / (s * 0.010416667) = 4 / 0.010416667.\n\nCalculating that: 4 / 0.010416667 \u2248 ?\n\nWell, 0.010416667 is approximately 1/96. Because 96 * 0.010416667 \u2248 1.\n\nSo 4 / (1/96) ) = 4 *96 = 384.

Hmm, I remember that average speed is total distance divided by total time, right?\n\nThe problem says the plane flies along the four sides of a square. So, each side must be the same length because it's a square. Let me think, if the sides are all equal, then the total distance would be four times the length of one side. But wait, I don't know the actual length of the side. Oh, but maybe I don't need it because it will cancel out in the average speed calculation. That makes sense because average speed is about the total distance over total time, and if the sides are equal, the actual length might not matter as long as I consider all four.\n\nThe speeds given are 200, 400, 600, and 800 km/hr for each side. So each side is covered at a different speed. Since the sides are equal in length, let's call the length of each side 's'. Then the total distance the plane travels is 4s.\n\nNow, I need to find the time taken for each side. Time is distance divided by speed. So for each side, the time would be s divided by the respective speed. Let me write that down:\n\nTime for first side: s / 200\nTime for second side: s / 400\nTime for third side: s / 600\nTime for fourth side: s / 800\n\nSo the total time is (s/200) + (s/400) + (s/600) + (s/800). I can factor out the 's' since it's common to all terms. So total time = s * (1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800).\n\nNow, average speed is total distance divided by total time. The total distance is 4s. So putting it together:\n\nAverage speed = (4s) / [s*(1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800)].\n\nOh, I see that the 's' cancels out. So now I just need to compute the denominator sum.\n\nLet me calculate the sum inside the brackets. Let's compute each term:\n\n1/200 = 0.005\n1/400 = 0.0025\n1/600 \u2248 0.0016667\n1/800 = 0.00125\n\nAdding them up: 0.005 + 0.0025 = 0.0075; 0.0075 + 0.0016667 \u2248 0.0091667; plus 0.00125 gives about 0.0104167.\n\nSo the denominator sum is approximately 0.0104167.\n\nNow, the average speed is 4 divided by 0.0104167. Let me compute that.\n\n4 / 0.0104167 \u2248 let's see. 0.0104167 is the same as 10.4167e-3. So 4 divided by 0.0104167 is the same as 4 * (1/0.0104167). Let me calculate 1/0.0104167.\n\nWait, 0.0104167 is approximately 1/96. So 1/(1/96) is 96. So 4 * 96 = 384. So the average speed is 384 km/h.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a miscalculation. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nCalculating the sum: 1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800.\n\nLet's find a common denominator. The denominators are 200, 400, 600, 800. Let's see, the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. 200 factors into 2^3 *5^2. 400 is 2^4 *5^2. 600 is 2^3 *3 *5^2. 800 is 2^5 *5^2. So the LCM would be 2^5 * 3 *5^2 = 32 *3 *25 = 32*75=2400.\n\nSo converting each term to denominator 2400:\n\n1/200 = 12/2400\n1/400 = 6/2400\n1/600 = 4/2400\n1/800 = 3/2400\n\nAdding them together: 12 +6 +4 +3 =25. So 25/2400.\n\nSo the sum is 25/2400.\n\nSo the average speed is 4 / (25/2400) )= 4 * (2400/25) = (4*2400)/25.\n\n2400 divided by 25 is 96. So 4*96=384.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the average speed is 384 km/hr.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 384. So the correct answer should be A.\n",

Let's compute each term:\n\n1/200 = 0.005\n1/400 = 0.0025\n1/600 \u2248 0.0016667\n1/800 = 0.00125\n\nAdding them up: 0.005 + 0.0025 = 0.0075; 0.0075 + 0.0016667 \u2248 0.0091667; plus 0.00125 gives about 0.0104167.\n\nSo the denominator sum is approximately 0.0104167.\n\nNow, the average speed is 4 divided by 0.0104167. Let me compute that.\n\n4 / 0.0104167 \u2248 let's see. 0.0104167 is the same as 10.4167e-3. So 4 divided by 0.0104167 is the same as 4 * (1/0.0104167). Let me calculate 1/0.0104167.\n\nWait, 0.0104167 is approximately 1/96. So 1/(1/96) is 96. So 4 * 96 = 384. So the average speed is 384 km/h.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a miscalculation. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nCalculating the sum: 1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800.\n\nLet's find a common denominator. The denominators are 200, 400, 600, 800. Let's see, the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. 200 factors into 2^3 *5^2. 400 is 2^4 *5^2. 600 is 2^3 *3 *5^2. 800 is 2^5 *5^2. So the LCM would be 2^5 * 3 *5^2 = 32 *3 *25 = 32*75=2400.\n\nSo converting each term to denominator 2400:\n\n1/200 = 12/2400\n1/400 = 6/2400\n1/600 = 4/2400\n1/800 = 3/2400\n\nAdding them together: 12 +6 +4 +3 =25. So 25/2400.\n\nSo the sum is 25/2400.\n\nSo the average speed is 4 / (25/2400) )= 4 * (2400/25) = (4*2400)/25.\n\n2400 divided by 25 is 96. So 4*96=384.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the average speed is 384 km/hr.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 384. So the correct answer should be A.\n\n\nTo determine the average speed of the aeroplane flying around the square field, we use the formula for average speed:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}}\n\\]\n\nSince the field is a square, all four sides are equal in length. Let the length of each side be \\( s \\). The total distance traveled by the aeroplane is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Distance} = 4s\n\\]\n\nThe time taken to travel each side is given by \\( \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} \\). The speeds for the four sides are 200 km/hr, 400 km/hr, 600 km/hr, and 800 km/hr. Thus, the time for each side is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time for first side} = \\frac{s}{200}, \\quad \\text{Time for second side} = \\frac{s}{400}, \\quad \\text{Time for third side} = \\frac{s}{600}, \\quad \\text{Time for fourth side} = \\frac{s}{800}\n\\]\n\nThe total time is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Time} = \\frac{s}{200} + \\frac{s}{400} + \\frac{s}{600} + \\frac{s}{800}\n\\]\n\nFactoring out \\( s \\), we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Time} = s \\left( \\frac{1}{200} + \\frac{1}{400} + \\frac{1}{600} + \\frac{1}{800} \\right)\n\\]\n\nTo simplify the sum inside the parentheses, we find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 200, 400, 600, and 800 is 2400. Converting each term to this common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{200} = \\frac{12}{2400}, \\quad \\frac{1}{400} = \\frac{6}{2400}, \\quad \\frac{1}{600} = \\frac{4}{2400}, \\quad \\frac{1}{800} = \\frac{3}{2400}\n\\]\n\nAdding these fractions:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{200} + \\frac{1}{400} + \\frac{1}{600} + \\frac{1}{800} = \\frac{12 + 6 + 4 + 3}{2400} = \\frac{25}{2400}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total time becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Time} = s \\cdot \\frac{25}{2400}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting into the formula for average speed:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{4s}{s \\cdot \\frac{25}{2400}} = \\frac{4}{\\frac{25}{2400}} = 4 \\cdot \\frac{2400}{25} = 4 \\cdot 96 = 384 \\, \\text{km/hr}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the average speed of the aeroplane is **384 km/hr**, which corresponds to option **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",

The plane flies each side of the square at different speeds: 200, 400, 600, and 800 km/hr. The question is asking for the average speed around the field.\n\nWait, average speed can be a bit tricky sometimes. I remember that average speed isn't just the average of the speeds; instead, it's total distance divided by total time.

Since it's a square, all four sides are equal in length. Let me denote the length of each side as 's'. So the total distance would be 4s.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the time taken for each side. Time is distance divided by speed. So for each side, the time taken would be s divided by the respective speed.\n\nLet me write this out. The times for each side are:\n- First side: s/200\n- Second side: s/400\n- Third side: s/600\n- Fourth side: s/800\n\nWait, that's correct. So the total time is the sum of these four times.

Let's find a common denominator. The denominators are 200,400,600,800. Let's see, 800 is the largest, but maybe 2400? Because 200 * 12 is 2400, 400 *6=2400, 600*4=2400, 800*3=2400.

So 25/2400 = 1/96.\n\nSo T = s * (1/96) hours. Wait, no, wait: 25/2400 is 1/96, so T = s * (1/96). Hmm, wait, s is the length of each side, so s is in km, right?\n\nSo the total time is s/96 hours.

I remember that average speed is total distance divided by total time. Right, so I need to calculate the total distance the plane travels and the total time it takes.\n\nThe square has four sides, so the plane flies along each side once. Let's say each side has a length 's'. So the total distance would be 4 times s, right? So 4s.\n\nNow, the plane flies each side at different speeds. The speeds given are 200, 400, 600, and 800 km/hr. Wait, does each side have a different speed? Oh, yes, the problem says so. So each side is covered at each speed once.\n\nI think the next step is to find out how long it takes to travel each side. Since speed is distance over time, time is distance over speed. So for each side, the time taken would be s divided by the speed for that side.\n\nSo for the first side, time t1 = s / 200. Second side, t2 = s / 400. Third, t3 = s / 600. Fourth, t4 = s / 800.\n\nAdding all these times together gives the total time. Let's compute that:\n\nTotal time = t1 + t2 + t3 + t4 = s/200 + s/400 + s/600 + s/800.\n\nHmm, to add these fractions, I need a common denominator. Let me find the least common multiple of 200, 400, 600, and 800. Well, 200 is 2^3 *5^2, 400 is 2^4 *5^2, 600 is 2^3 *3 *5^2, 800 is 2^5 *5^2. So the LCM would be 2^5 *3 *5^2, which is 32 *3 *25 = 2400.\n\nSo each term can be expressed with denominator 2400.\n\ns/200 = (12s)/2400 because 200 *12=2400.\n\ns/400 = (6s)/2400.\n\ns/600 = (4s)/2400.\n\ns/800 = (3s)/2400.\n\nAdding them up: 12s +6s +4s +3s =25s.

I remember that average speed is total distance divided by total time. Right, so I need to calculate the total distance the plane travels and the total time it takes.\n\nThe square has four sides, so the plane flies along each side once. Let's say each side has a length 's'. So the total distance would be 4 times s, right? So 4s.\n\nNow, the plane flies each side at different speeds. The speeds given are 200, 400, 600, and 800 km/hr. Wait, does each side have a different speed? Oh, yes, the problem says so. So each side is covered at each speed once.\n\nI think the next step is to find out how long it takes to travel each side. Since speed is distance over time, time is distance over speed. So for each side, the time taken would be s divided by the speed for that side.\n\nSo for the first side, time t1 = s / 200. Second side, t2 = s / 400. Third, t3 = s / 600. Fourth, t4 = s / 800.\n\nAdding all these times together gives the total time. Let's compute that:\n\nTotal time = t1 + t2 + t3 + t4 = s/200 + s/400 + s/600 + s/800.\n\nHmm, to add these fractions, I need a common denominator. Let me find the least common multiple of 200, 400, 600, and 800. Well, 200 is 2^3 *5^2, 400 is 2^4 *5^2, 600 is 2^3 *3 *5^2, 800 is 2^5 *5^2. So the LCM would be 2^5 *3 *5^2, which is 32 *3 *25 = 2400.\n\nSo each term can be expressed with denominator 2400.\n\ns/200 = (12s)/2400 because 200 *12=2400.\n\ns/400 = (6s)/2400.\n\ns/600 = (4s)/2400.\n\ns/800 = (3s)/2400.\n\nAdding them up: 12s +6s +4s +3s =25s. So total time = 25s /2400 = s*(25/2400) = s*(5/480) = s/(96/5) ) Wait, maybe I should just keep it as 25s/2400 for now.\n\nSo total time is 25s/2400.\n\nNow, average speed is total distance over total time. Total distance is 4s.\n\nSo average speed V_avg = 4s / (25s/2400) ).\n\nWait, let's compute that. The s cancels out.\n\nV_avg =4 / (25/2400) )= 4 * (2400/25) = (4 * 2400) /25.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n2400 divided by 25 is 96. 4 times 96 is 384.\n\nSo the average speed is 384 km/hr.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 384. So the correct answer should be A.\n\n\nTo find the average speed of the aeroplane flying around the square field, we use the formula for average speed: \n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}}\n\\]\n\nThe aeroplane flies along four sides of a square, each of length \\( s \\). Therefore, the total distance is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Distance} = 4s\n\\]\n\nThe speeds for the four sides are given as 200 km/hr, 400 km/hr, 600 km/hr, and 800 km/hr. The time taken to travel each side is calculated as:\n\n\\[\nt_1 = \\frac{s}{200}, \\quad t_2 = \\frac{s}{400}, \\quad t_3 = \\frac{s}{600}, \\quad t_4 = \\frac{s}{800}\n\\]\n\nThe total time is the sum of these times:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Time} = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 + t_4 = \\frac{s}{200} + \\frac{s}{400} + \\frac{s}{600} + \\frac{s}{800}\n\\]\n\nTo add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 2400:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{s}{200} = \\frac{12s}{2400}, \\quad \\frac{s}{400} = \\frac{6s}{2400}, \\quad \\frac{s}{600} = \\frac{4s}{2400}, \\quad \\frac{s}{800} = \\frac{3s}{2400}\n\\]\n\nAdding these:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Time} = \\frac{12s + 6s + 4s + 3s}{2400} = \\frac{25s}{2400}\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute into the formula for average speed:\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}} = \\frac{4s}{\\frac{25s}{2400}}\n\\]\n\nThe \\( s \\) cancels out:\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{4}{\\frac{25}{2400}} = 4 \\times \\frac{2400}{25} = \\frac{9600}{25} = 384 \\, \\text{km/hr}\n\\]\n\nThus, the average speed of the aeroplane is **384 km/hr**, which corresponds to option **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",
