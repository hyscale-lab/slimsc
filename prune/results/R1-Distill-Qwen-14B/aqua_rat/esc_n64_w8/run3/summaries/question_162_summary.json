      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: 10 kg of a mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay. We need to find out how much of the mixture should be removed and replaced with pure sand so that the mixture ends up having equal quantities of clay and sand.\n\nHmm, so initially, the mixture has more clay than sand. The goal is to make them equal. I think I remember something about these kinds of problems involving some kind of equation, maybe using the concept of concentration or something.\n\nLet me break it down. The initial mixture is 10 kg. 30% sand means 0.3 * 10 kg = 3 kg of sand. And 70% clay would be 0.7 * 10 kg = 7 kg of clay. So we have 3 kg sand and 7 kg clay.\n\nWe want to make the amounts of sand and clay equal. So the final mixture should have 5 kg each of sand and clay, because 5+5=10 kg. Wait, but wait a second. If we remove some mixture and add sand, the total mixture remains the same, right? Or do we remove and replace, so the total is still 10 kg? Yeah, I think that's right. So the total mass after replacement is still 10 kg.\n\nSo let's say we remove x kg of the mixture. Since the mixture is 30% sand and 70% clay, when we remove x kg, we're removing 0.3x kg of sand and 0.7x kg of clay. Then we add x kg of pure sand. So the new amounts of sand and clay will be:\n\nSand: initial 3 kg minus 0.3x, plus x (because we add x kg of pure sand). So that's 3 - 0.3x + x = 3 + 0.7x.\n\nClay: initial 7 kg minus 0.7x (because we removed 0.7x kg of clay), and we didn't add any clay. So that's 7 - 0.7x.\n\nWe want sand and clay to be equal, so set them equal:\n\n3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x.\n\nLet me solve that equation. Bring the 0.7x from the right to the left:\n\n3 + 0.7x + 0.7x = 7.\n\nSo 3 + 1.4x =7.\n\nSubtract 3 from both sides: 1.4x =4.\n\nSo x =4 /1.4.\n\nWait, 4 divided by 1.4. Let me compute that. 1.4 is 14/10, so 4 divided by (14/10) is 4 * (10/14) = 40/14 = 20/7. Hmm, 20/7 is approximately 2.857 kg.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check my reasoning again. Because when we remove x kg, we're removing both sand and clay, right? So the sand after removal is 3 -0.3x, and then adding x kg of sand gives 3 -0.3x +x =3 +0.7x. Clay is 7 -0.7x. So setting equal, 3+0.7x =7-0.7x. So 1.4x=4, x=4/1.4 = 20/7. That's about 2.857 kg.\n\nSo the amount to be removed is 20/7 kg. Looking at the options, option B is 20/7. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. When you remove x kg of the mixture and replace it with x kg of pure sand, the total mass remains 10 kg. So yes, that's correct. The initial mass is 10 kg, and after removal and adding, it's still 10 kg.\n\nAnother way to approach this is using the concept of alligation or maybe using the formula for mixture replacement problems. The formula I remember is something like the final concentration equals initial concentration minus (replacement)*(concentration difference). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe using the concept of mass balance.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about the clay. After replacement, the clay should be 5 kg because sand and clay are equal. The initial clay is 7 kg, and we remove some clay. So the remaining clay is 7 -0.7x =5 kg.\n\nSo 7 -0.7x =5 \u2192 0.7x=2 \u2192 x=2/0.7=20/7. Which matches the previous result. So that's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be B)20/7.\n",

The question says that there's a 10kg mixture containing 30% sand and 70% clay. We need to make the mixture have equal parts clay and sand by removing some of the mixture and replacing it with pure sand. I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let me understand the current composition. The mixture is 10kg total. 30% is sand, so that's 0.3 * 10 = 3kg of sand. The rest, which is 70%, is clay, so that's 7kg of clay. So we have 3kg sand and 7kg clay.\n\nThe goal is to have equal amounts of sand and clay. So each should be 5kg in the mixture. Wait, wait. Because if the total is still 10kg, then each would be 5kg. Right, because 5 +5 =10. So I need to end up with 5kg of sand and 5kg of clay.\n\nBut how do I get there by removing some of the mixture and adding sand? Let me think. When we remove a portion of the mixture, the proportion of sand and clay removed will be the same as the current mixture. So if I remove x kg of the mixture, the amount of sand removed will be 0.3x and the clay removed will be 0.7x. Then, I replace that x kg with pure sand, which is 100% sand. So the added sand is x kg.\n\nLet me write that down as equations. Let x be the amount of mixture removed and replaced with sand.\n\nAfter removal:\nSand becomes: original sand - removed sand + added sand\nWhich is 3 - 0.3x + x = 3 + 0.7x.\n\nClay becomes: original clay - removed clay =7 -0.7x.\n\nWe want sand and clay to be equal, so:\n\n3 + 0.7x =7 - 0.7x.\n\nLet me solve for x.\n\n3 + 0.7x =7 -0.7x\nBring the 0.7x to the right and 3 to the left: 0.7x +0.7x =7-3\nSo 1.4x =4\nx=4/1.4\nSimplify that, 4 divided by 1.4. Hmm, 1.4 is 14/10, so 4/(14/10) =4*(10/14) =40/14 =20/7. Oh, so x is 20/7 kg. Wait, but that's more than 2kg. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, 20/7 is approximately 2.857kg. So removing about 2.857kg of the mixture, which is 30% sand and 70% clay. So the sand removed is 0.3*(20/7) =6/7 kg. Clay removed is 0.7*(20/7)=2 kg. So after removal, sand is 3 -6/7 = (21-6)/7=15/7 kg, and clay is 7 -2=5 kg. Then we add 20/7 kg of pure sand, so total sand becomes 15/7 +20/7=35/7=5 kg. Clay is 5 kg. So yes, that works. So x is 20/7 kg, which is option B.\n\nWait, let me double-check the equations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The initial sand is 3kg. After removing x kg, the sand is 3 - 0.3x. Then we add x kg of sand, so 3 -0.3x +x =3 +0.7x. The clay is 7 -0.7x. Setting them equal: 3+0.7x=7-0.7x. Yes, that's correct. 1.4x=4, x=4/(1.4) =20/7.\n\nSo the correct answer is B)20/7.\n",

So removing about 2.857kg of the mixture, which is 30% sand and 70% clay. So the sand removed is 0.3*(20/7) =6/7 kg. Clay removed is 0.7*(20/7)=2 kg. So after removal, sand is 3 -6/7 = (21-6)/7=15/7 kg, and clay is 7 -2=5 kg. Then we add 20/7 kg of pure sand, so total sand becomes 15/7 +20/7=35/7=5 kg. Clay is 5 kg. So yes, that works.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a mixture of sand and clay. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of mixture problems, but I think I can figure it out.\n\nThe problem says: 10kg of a mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay. We need to find out how much of this mixture should be removed and replaced with pure sand so that the final mixture has equal parts clay and sand. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.\n\nHmm, let me start by figuring out the initial amounts of sand and clay. The total mass is 10kg. 30% is sand, so that's 0.3 *10 = 3kg of sand. The rest is clay, which is 70% of 10kg, so 7kg of clay. So initially, we have 3kg sand and 7kg clay.\n\nOur goal is to make the mixture have equal amounts of clay and sand. That means in the end, we need 5kg each of sand and clay because 5+5=10kg. Wait, but if we're replacing some of the mixture with pure sand, the total mass might stay the same? Or does it change? Let me think.\n\nWait, the question says \"removed and replaced\". So I think the total mass remains 10kg because whatever we remove is replaced with the same amount of sand. So the total will still be 10kg after replacement.\n\nSo the final mixture must have 5kg sand and 5kg clay. Let's see how much clay we have initially, which is 7kg. To reach 5kg clay, we need to remove 2kg of clay. Because 7kg - 2kg =5kg.\n\nBut wait, when you remove a portion of the mixture, you're removing both sand and clay in the ratio they are present. So if I remove x kg of the mixture, how much sand and clay is that?\n\nThe initial mixture is 30% sand and 70% clay. So in x kg removed, the amount of sand removed is 0.3x, and clay removed is 0.7x.\n\nAfter removal, the remaining sand is 3 - 0.3x, and remaining clay is 7 -0.7x. Then, we add pure sand, which is x kg (because we removed x kg and replaced it with x kg of sand). So the new amount of sand is (3 - 0.3x) + x = 3 +0.7x.\n\nThe clay remains at 7 -0.7x.\n\nWe need the final amounts to be equal: 3 +0.7x = 7 -0.7x.\n\nLet me solve that equation.\n\n3 +0.7x =7 -0.7x\n\nAdding 0.7x to both sides: 3 +1.4x =7\n\nSubtract 3: 1.4x =4\n\nSo x=4 /1.4 = (4 *10)/(14) =40/14=20/7.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a mixture of sand and clay. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of mixture problems, but I think I can figure it out.\n\nThe problem says: 10kg of a mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay. We need to find out how much of this mixture should be removed and replaced with pure sand so that the final mixture has equal parts clay and sand. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.\n\nHmm, let me start by figuring out the initial amounts of sand and clay. The total mass is 10kg. 30% is sand, so that's 0.3 *10 = 3kg of sand. The rest is clay, which is 70% of 10kg, so 7kg of clay. So initially, we have 3kg sand and 7kg clay.\n\nOur goal is to make the mixture have equal amounts of clay and sand. That means in the end, we need 5kg each of sand and clay because 5+5=10kg. Wait, but if we're replacing some of the mixture with pure sand, the total mass might stay the same? Or does it change? Let me think.\n\nWait, the question says \"removed and replaced\". So I think the total mass remains 10kg because whatever we remove is replaced with the same amount of sand. So the total will still be 10kg after replacement.\n\nSo the final mixture must have 5kg sand and 5kg clay. Let's see how much clay we have initially, which is 7kg. To reach 5kg clay, we need to remove 2kg of clay. Because 7kg - 2kg =5kg.\n\nBut wait, when you remove a portion of the mixture, you're removing both sand and clay in the ratio they are present. So if I remove x kg of the mixture, how much sand and clay is that?\n\nThe initial mixture is 30% sand and 70% clay. So in x kg removed, the amount of sand removed is 0.3x, and clay removed is 0.7x.\n\nAfter removal, the remaining sand is 3 - 0.3x, and remaining clay is 7 -0.7x. Then, we add pure sand, which is x kg (because we removed x kg and replaced it with x kg of sand). So the new amount of sand is (3 - 0.3x) + x = 3 +0.7x.\n\nThe clay remains at 7 -0.7x.\n\nWe need the final amounts to be equal: 3 +0.7x = 7 -0.7x.\n\nLet me solve that equation.\n\n3 +0.7x =7 -0.7x\n\nAdding 0.7x to both sides: 3 +1.4x =7\n\nSubtract 3: 1.4x =4\n\nSo x=4 /1.4 = (4 *10)/(14) =40/14=20/7. Wait, 40/14 simplifies to 20/7, which is approximately 2.857kg.\n\nSo x is 20/7 kg. That's the amount to remove and replace. Let me check.\n\nSo, the steps were:\n\n1. Initial amounts: 3kg sand, 7kg clay.\n2. Let x be the kg of mixture removed and replaced with sand.\n3. After removal, sand becomes 3 -0.3x, clay becomes 7 -0.7x.\n4. After adding x kg sand: sand is 3-0.3x +x =3+0.7x.\n5. Set 3+0.7x =7 -0.7x \u2192 solve for x.\n6. x=20/7 kg.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 20/7. So the answer should be B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by determining the initial amounts of sand and clay in the mixture. The total mass is 10 kg, with 30% sand and 70% clay. This gives:\n\n- Sand: \\( 0.3 \\times 10 = 3 \\, \\text{kg} \\)\n- Clay: \\( 0.7 \\times 10 = 7 \\, \\text{kg} \\)\n\nThe goal is to make the mixture contain equal amounts of sand and clay, which means the final mixture should have 5 kg of sand and 5 kg of clay. To achieve this, we need to remove some of the mixture and replace it with pure sand.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the mass of the mixture removed. Since the mixture is 30% sand and 70% clay, removing \\( x \\, \\text{kg} \\) of the mixture removes \\( 0.3x \\, \\text{kg} \\) of sand and \\( 0.7x \\, \\text{kg} \\) of clay. After removal, the remaining amounts of sand and clay are:\n\n- Sand: \\( 3 - 0.3x \\)\n- Clay: \\( 7 - 0.7x \\)\n\nWhen \\( x \\, \\text{kg} \\) of pure sand is added, the new amount of sand becomes:\n\n\\[\n(3 - 0.3x) + x = 3 + 0.7x\n\\]\n\nThe clay remains at \\( 7 - 0.7x \\).

The idea is to remove some of the mixture and replace it with pure sand. So when we remove a portion of the mixture, we're taking away both sand and clay in the same proportion as they exist in the mixture. Then, adding pure sand will increase the sand content.\n\nLet me denote the amount of mixture to be removed as x kg. So, when we remove x kg of the mixture, we're removing 30% sand and 70% clay from it. That means we're removing 0.3x kg of sand and 0.7x kg of clay.\n\nAfter removal, the remaining mixture is 10 - x kg. The remaining sand would be 3 - 0.3x kg, and the remaining clay would be 7 - 0.7x kg. Then, we add x kg of pure sand, which is 100% sand. So the new amount of sand becomes (3 - 0.3x) + x = 3 + 0.7x kg. The clay remains at 7 - 0.7x kg.\n\nNow, the final mixture should have equal amounts of sand and clay. So set them equal:\n\n3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x\n\nLet me solve this equation for x.\n\nCombine like terms: 0.7x + 0.7x = 7 -3\n1.4x =4\nx =4 /1.4\n\nHmm, 4 divided by 1.4.

Let me read it again.\n\nSo, the problem says we have 10 kg of a mixture that's 30% sand and 70% clay. The goal is to make the mixture have equal parts clay and sand. To do this, we're supposed to remove some of the mixture and replace it with pure sand. The question is asking how much of the mixture we need to remove and replace. The options are given as fractions, so I think the answer might not be a whole number.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I remember that when dealing with mixtures, sometimes setting up equations based on the amounts can help. Let me jot down the initial quantities.\n\nInitially, the mixture is 10 kg. 30% is sand, so that's 0.3 * 10 = 3 kg of sand. The rest is clay, so 7 kg. Got that.\n\nOur goal is to have equal amounts of sand and clay. So each should be 5 kg, because 10 kg total divided by 2 is 5. So we need to end up with 5 kg sand and 5 kg clay.\n\nWait, but we're adding pure sand. So when we remove some mixture and replace it with pure sand, we're increasing the sand content. But the clay content will decrease because we're taking out some of the mixture which has both sand and clay, and replacing it with sand.\n\nLet me think about this in terms of variables. Let's say we remove x kg of the mixture. The mixture has 30% sand and 70% clay, so when we remove x kg, we're removing 0.3x sand and 0.7x clay.\n\nAfter removal, the remaining mixture is (10 - x) kg. The sand left would be 3 - 0.3x, and clay would be 7 - 0.7x.\n\nThen, we add x kg of pure sand. So the total sand becomes (3 - 0.3x) + x = 3 + 0.7x. The clay remains at 7 - 0.7x because we only added sand.\n\nNow, we want the sand and clay to be equal. So:\n\n3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x\n\nLet me solve this equation.\n\nAdding 0.7x to both sides:\n\n3 + 1.4x = 7\n\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n\n1.4x = 4\n\nDivide both sides by 1.4:\n\nx = 4 / 1.4\n\nHmm, 4 divided by 1.4. Let me compute that. 1.4 is the same as 14/10, so 4 divided by (14/10) is 4 * (10/14) = 40/14 = 20/7. Oh, wait, that's one of the options. Option B is 20/7.\n\nWait a second, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the setup. So the equation is correct because after adding x kg of sand, the sand increases by x, and the removed part reduces both sand and clay.\n\nSo yeah, the calculation seems right. So the amount to remove is 20/7 kg, which is approximately 2.857 kg.\n\nWait, but let me check. Because when you remove 20/7 kg, which is about 2.857 kg, the remaining mixture is 10 - 20/7 = (70/7 -20/7) =50/7 kg. Then adding 20/7 kg of sand gives 50/7 +20/7=70/7=10 kg, which makes sense.\n\nThe sand after replacement is 3 kg minus 0.3*(20/7) +20/7. Let me compute that.\n\n0.3 * (20/7) = (3/10)*(20/7) = (60/70) = 6/7. So initial sand is 3 kg, which is 21/7. Subtract 6/7, so 15/7. Then add 20/7 kg. So total sand is 15/7 +20/7=35/7=5 kg. And clay is initial 7 kg minus 0.7*(20/7). 0.7 is 7/10, so 7/10 *20/7= 20/10=2 kg. So 7 kg -2 kg=5 kg. That works. So yes, the answer is 20/7, which is option B.\n",

But the clay content will decrease because we're taking out some of the mixture which has both sand and clay, and replacing it with sand.\n\nLet me think about this in terms of variables. Let's say we remove x kg of the mixture. The mixture has 30% sand and 70% clay, so when we remove x kg, we're removing 0.3x sand and 0.7x clay.\n\nAfter removal, the remaining mixture is (10 - x) kg. The sand left would be 3 - 0.3x, and clay would be 7 - 0.7x.\n\nThen, we add x kg of pure sand. So the total sand becomes (3 - 0.3x) + x = 3 + 0.7x. The clay remains at 7 - 0.7x because we only added sand.\n\nNow, we want the sand and clay to be equal. So:\n\n3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x\n\nLet me solve this equation.\n\nAdding 0.7x to both sides:\n\n3 + 1.4x = 7\n\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n\n1.4x = 4\n\nDivide both sides by 1.4:\n\nx = 4 / 1.4\n\nHmm, 4 divided by 1.4. Let me compute that. 1.4 is the same as 14/10, so 4 divided by (14/10) is 4 * (10/14) = 40/14 = 20/7. Oh, wait, that's one of the options. Option B is 20/7.\n\nWait a second, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the setup. So the equation is correct because after adding x kg of sand, the sand increases by x, and the removed part reduces both sand and clay.\n\nSo yeah, the calculation seems right. So the amount to remove is 20/7 kg, which is approximately 2.857 kg.\n\nWait, but let me check. Because when you remove 20/7 kg, which is about 2.857 kg, the remaining mixture is 10 - 20/7 = (70/7 -20/7) =50/7 kg. Then adding 20/7 kg of sand gives 50/7 +20/7=70/7=10 kg, which makes sense.\n\nThe sand after replacement is 3 kg minus 0.3*(20/7) +20/7. Let me compute that.\n\n0.3 * (20/7) = (3/10)*(20/7) = (60/70) = 6/7. So initial sand is 3 kg, which is 21/7. Subtract 6/7, so 15/7. Then add 20/7 kg. So total sand is 15/7 +20/7=35/7=5 kg. And clay is initial 7 kg minus 0.7*(20/7). 0.7 is 7/10, so 7/10 *20/7= 20/10=2 kg. So 7 kg -2 kg=5 kg. That works. So yes, the answer is 20/7, which is option B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by analyzing the initial mixture. The mixture is 10 kg, with 30% sand and 70% clay. This means the initial amounts of sand and clay are:\n\n- Sand: \\( 0.3 \\times 10 = 3 \\, \\text{kg} \\)\n- Clay: \\( 0.7 \\times 10 = 7 \\, \\text{kg} \\)\n\nThe goal is to make the mixture contain equal quantities of sand and clay, i.e., 5 kg each. To achieve this, we need to remove \\( x \\, \\text{kg} \\) of the mixture and replace it with pure sand.\n\nWhen \\( x \\, \\text{kg} \\) of the mixture is removed, the amounts of sand and clay removed are:\n\n- Sand removed: \\( 0.3x \\, \\text{kg} \\)\n- Clay removed: \\( 0.7x \\, \\text{kg} \\)\n\nAfter removal, the remaining amounts of sand and clay in the mixture are:\n\n- Sand: \\( 3 - 0.3x \\, \\text{kg} \\)\n- Clay: \\( 7 - 0.7x \\, \\text{kg} \\)\n\nAdding \\( x \\, \\text{kg} \\) of pure sand increases the total sand to:\n\n\\[\n(3 - 0.3x) + x = 3 + 0.7x \\, \\text{kg}\n\\]\n\nThe clay remains at \\( 7 - 0.7x \\, \\text{kg} \\). To make the amounts of sand and clay equal, we set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n3 + 0.7x + 0.7x = 7\n\\]\n\\[\n3 + 1.4x = 7\n\\]\n\\[\n1.4x = 4\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4}{1.4} = \\frac{20}{7} \\, \\text{kg}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( \\frac{20}{7} \\, \\text{kg} \\) of the mixture needs to be removed and replaced with pure sand to achieve equal quantities of sand and clay. Verifying the result confirms that the final amounts of sand and clay are both 5 kg, so the solution is correct.\n\nAnswer: B",

The question is asking how much of the mixture needs to be removed.\n\nHmm. So initially, the mixture is 10kg. 30% is sand, so that's 3 kg of sand. 70% is clay, which is 7 kg of clay. We want to end up with equal amounts, so each should be 5 kg each, because 10kg total divided by two is 5 kg. So the clay needs to decrease from 7kg to 5kg, and sand increase from 3kg to 5kg.\n\nWait, but when we remove some mixture, we're taking away both sand and clay. Then we add pure sand. So the key is to find out how much mixture to remove so that after adding sand, the proportions become equal.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Let's say we remove x kg of the mixture. Since the mixture is 30% sand, when we remove x kg, we take away 0.3x kg of sand and 0.7x kg of clay. So after removal, the remaining sand would be 3 - 0.3x, and clay would be 7 - 0.7x. Then we add x kg of pure sand, which is 100% sand. So the new amount of sand becomes (3 - 0.3x) + x = 3 + 0.7x. The clay remains at 7 - 0.7x.\n\nWe want the amounts of sand and clay to be equal. So set them equal:\n\n3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x\n\nLet me solve this equation. Adding 0.7x to both sides gives 3 + 1.4x =7. Subtract 3 from both sides: 1.4x=4. Then x=4/(1.4). Hmm, 1.4 is the same as 14/10, so 4 divided by 14/10 is 4 * 10/14 = 40/14 = 20/7. Wait, 20/7 is approximately 2.857 kg. Let me check the options. Option B is 20/7.

So when we set 3 +0.7x =7 -0.7x, solving gives 1.4x=4, so x=4/(1.4)= 20/7. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using the concept of alligation.

To make the quantities of sand and clay equal, we set these two expressions equal:\n\n\\[\n3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n0.7x + 0.7x = 7 - 3\n\\]\n\\[\n1.4x = 4\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4}{1.4} = \\frac{20}{7} \\, \\text{kg}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( \\frac{20}{7} \\, \\text{kg} \\) of the mixture must be removed and replaced with pure sand to achieve equal quantities of sand and clay. Verifying the result:\n\n- New sand: \\( 3 + 0.7 \\times \\frac{20}{7} = 3 + 2 = 5 \\, \\text{kg} \\)\n- New clay: \\( 7 - 0.7 \\times \\frac{20}{7} = 7 - 2 = 5 \\, \\text{kg} \\)\n\nBoth quantities are indeed equal, confirming the solution is correct.\n\n**Answer: B**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about mixing sand and clay. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says that there's a 10kg mixture which is 30% sand and 70% clay. And the goal is to make the mixture have equal amounts of clay and sand by removing some of the mixture and replacing it with pure sand. I need to find out how much of the mixture should be removed and replaced.\n\nWait, so the initial mixture is 10kg. 30% is sand, so that's 3kg of sand and 7kg of clay. Because 10kg times 0.3 is 3, and 0.7 is 7. Got that part.\n\nNow, the aim is to have equal quantities of clay and sand. That means each should be 5kg in the mixture, right? Because 10kg total, so 5 each. So I need to figure out how much of the original mixture to remove and replace with pure sand to get from 3kg sand and 7kg clay to 5kg each.\n\nWait, but when you remove some mixture, you're removing both sand and clay in the ratio of the mixture. So the removed portion will have 30% sand and 70% clay. So if I remove x kg of the mixture, I'm taking away 0.3x kg of sand and 0.7x kg of clay.\n\nAfter removing x kg, the remaining sand would be 3 - 0.3x kg, and the remaining clay would be 7 - 0.7x kg.\n\nThen, I add back x kg of pure sand. So the sand becomes (3 - 0.3x) + x = 3 + 0.7x kg. The clay remains at 7 - 0.7x kg.\n\nNow, we want the sand and clay to be equal. So set them equal:\n\n3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x\n\nHmm, solving for x. Let's move the 0.7x terms to one side.\n\n3 + 0.7x + 0.7x = 7\n\n3 + 1.4x = 7\n\n1.4x = 7 -3 =4\n\nx=4 / 1.4\n\nWait, 4 divided by 1.4. Let me compute that. 1.4 is the same as 14/10, so 4 divided by (14/10) is 4 * (10/14) = 40/14 = 20/7. Oh, so x is 20/7 kg.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. So, 20/7 is approximately 2.857 kg. Let's see if that makes sense.\n\nOriginal sand:3kg, clay:7kg.\n\nRemoving 20/7 kg of mixture: sand removed is 0.3*(20/7) = 6/7 kg. Clay removed is 0.7*(20/7)= 20/10=2 kg.\n\nSo remaining sand is 3 -6/7 = (21-6)/7=15/7 kg. Remaining clay is 7 - 2=5 kg.\n\nThen, adding 20/7 kg of sand: total sand is 15/7 +20/7=35/7=5 kg. Clay is 5 kg. Yes, that works. So x is 20/7 kg, which is option B.\n\nSo the answer is B) 20/7.\n",
