      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the value of k, which is the number of consecutive integers that add up to 51. The smallest integer in this sequence is -50. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. I remember that the sum of consecutive integers can be found using the formula for an arithmetic series. Since they're consecutive, the difference between each term is 1. So, it's an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1.\n\nThe formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is S = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference. In this case, S is 51, a is -50, and d is 1. So I can plug those values into the formula.\n\nWait, let me write that out. So, 51 = k/2 * [2*(-50) + (k-1)*1]. Simplify that a bit. 2*(-50) is -100, and (k-1)*1 is just (k-1). So the equation becomes 51 = (k/2) * (-100 + k -1). Let me compute -100 + k -1. That's k - 101. So now the equation is 51 = (k/2) * (k - 101).\n\nHmm, I can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the denominator. That gives me 102 = k*(k - 101). Let's rearrange that into a standard quadratic equation. So 102 = k^2 - 101k. Bringing everything to one side, it becomes k^2 - 101k - 102 = 0.\n\nWait, wait a minute. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, starting from the sum formula:\n\nSum = (number of terms)/2 * [2a + (n-1)d]\n\nWhich is correct. Plugging in a=-50, d=1, sum=51:\n\n51 = (k/2) * [2*(-50) + (k-1)*1]\n\nWhich simplifies to 51 = (k/2) * (-100 +k -1) \u2192 51 = (k/2)(k-101). Yes, that's right.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: 102 = k(k -101) \u2192 k\u00b2 -101k -102 =0.\n\nNow I need to solve this quadratic equation. Let's see if I can factor it. Hmm, looking for two numbers that multiply to -102 and add up to -101. Let me think... 102 is 2*3*17. So factors could be 1 and 102, 2 and 51, 3 and 34, 6 and 17.\n\nLooking for a pair where one is positive and the other negative such that their product is -102 and sum is -101. Let's see: 102 and -1. 102*(-1) = -102, and 102 + (-1) = 101. Oh wait, but in our equation, the middle term is -101k. So the factors would be 102 and -1, but that would give us (k -1)(k +102) = 0 \u2192 k=1 or k=-102. But that can't be right because when I plug back, it would give k=1, but let's see.\n\nWait, wait. Let me re-express the quadratic equation correctly. The equation is k\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0. So the product is -102, and the sum is -101. Wait, no, because when I factor it as (k - a)(k - b) = 0, the sum is a + b, and the product is a*b. So in this case, a and b should satisfy a + b = 101 (because the middle term is -101k, so it's -(a + b)k) and a * b = -102.\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think again. The standard form is k\u00b2 + (sum)k + product. Wait no, in the equation k\u00b2 - (sum)k + product, but when the middle term is negative. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the quadratic formula to solve for k. The quadratic equation is k\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0. So using the quadratic formula: k = [101 \u00b1 sqrt( (101)^2 + 4*1*102 ) ] / 2.\n\nLet me compute the discriminant. (101)^2 is 10201. 4*1*102 is 408. So discriminant D = 10201 + 408 = 10609. What's the square root of 10609? Let me think. 100^2 is 10000, 103^2 is 10609. Oh right, because 103 * 103 is 10609. So sqrt(10609) is 103.\n\nSo, k = [101 \u00b1 103]/2. Let's compute both possibilities.\n\nFirst, 101 + 103 = 204. Divided by 2 is 102. Second, 101 -103 = -2. Divided by 2 is -1.\n\nSo, the possible solutions are k=102 and k=-1. Since k can't be negative (it's the number of terms), k=102.\n\nWait, but let's check if this makes sense. If we have 102 consecutive integers starting at -50, what's the sum? Let me see. The last term would be a + (k-1)*d = -50 + 101*1 = 51. So the numbers are from -50 to 51, inclusive.\n\nWait, how many numbers is that? From -50 to 51: the number of terms is 51 - (-50) +1. Because when you count inclusive, you add 1. So 51 +50 = 101, plus 1 is 102. Oh right, that's correct.\n\nWait, let me compute the sum again. The average of the series is (first + last)/2 = (-50 +51)/2 = (1)/2 = 0.5. Multiply by the number of terms: 0.5 *102=51. Yes, that's correct. So the sum is indeed 51.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, one of the choices is E) 102. So that's the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's another possible solution. The quadratic gave us k=102 and k=-1. Since k can't be negative, 102 is the only valid solution. So the answer should be E) 102.\n\nBut wait, the options given are A)40, B)62, C)82, D)92, E)102. So E is the correct choice.\n",

So plugging these into the formula:\n\n51 = k/2 * [2*(-50) + (k-1)*1]\n\nLet me compute that step by step. \n\nFirst, 2*(-50) is -100. Then, (k-1)*1 is just (k-1). Adding those together gives (-100 + k -1) = (k - 101). \n\nSo the equation becomes:\n51 = (k/2) * (k - 101)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n102 = k*(k - 101)\n\nExpanding the right side:\n102 = k\u00b2 - 101k\n\nBring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:\nk\u00b2 - 101k - 102 = 0\n\nHmm, I need to solve for k here. Let's try to factor this quadratic. Alternatively, I can use the quadratic formula. Let me see if it's factorable.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -102 and add up to -101. Wait, that's tricky. Let's see: factors of 102 are 1 and 102, 2 and 51, 3 and 34, 6 and 17. Hmm. Since the product is negative, one number is positive and the other is negative.\n\nWait, 102 is positive, but the product is -102. So maybe 102 and -1: 102 * (-1) = -102, and 102 + (-1) = 101. But our middle term is -101k, so when we factor, the signs would be opposite. Let me set up the factors.\n\nLooking for (k - a)(k + b) = 0, where a and b are positive numbers. Expanding gives k\u00b2 + (b -a)k -ab. We need ab = 102 and (b -a) = -101.\n\nWait, but (b -a) is -101, which would mean that a - b = 101. So a = b + 101. Then, ab = 102.\n\nSubstituting a = b +101 into ab=102:\n\n(b + 101)*b = 102\n\nb\u00b2 + 101b - 102 = 0\n\nHmm, that's another quadratic. Let me compute the discriminant: D = 101\u00b2 + 4*102 = 10201 + 408 = 10609. The square root of 10609 is... let me think. 103\u00b2 is 10609 because 100\u00b2=10000, 101\u00b2=10201, 102\u00b2=10404, 103\u00b2=10609. So sqrt(10609)=103.\n\nSo b = [-101 \u00b1103]/2.\n\nTaking the positive root because b must be positive: ( -101 +103 ) / 2 = 2/2 =1. So b=1, and a=1+101=102.\n\nSo the factors are (k -102)(k +1)=0. So k=102 or k=-1. But k can't be negative because it's the number of terms. So k=102.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me check that. If k is 102, then the series starts at -50 and has 102 terms. The last term would be a + (k-1)*d = -50 +101*1 =51. So the numbers go from -50 up to 51, inclusive. Let me compute the sum.\n\nThe average of the first and last term is (-50 +51)/2 = 0.5. Multiply by the number of terms (102) gives 0.5 *102=51. That's correct. So the sum is indeed 51.\n\nBut wait, I have to make sure that all the numbers are integers and consecutive. Yes, they are.\n\nSo the answer should be E) 102.\n\nBut wait, the options include E as 102. But let me check the options again.\n\nOptions: A)40, B)62, C)82, D)92, E)102.\n\nSo E is correct.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me think if I made any mistake in the quadratic solution. Let me retrace.\n\nThe quadratic equation was k\u00b2 -101k -102=0. Using the quadratic formula, k = [101 \u00b1 sqrt(101\u00b2 +4*102)] /2.\n\n101\u00b2 is 10201. 4*102 is 408. So sqrt(10201+408)=sqrt(10609)=103.\n\nSo k = [101 +103]/2 = 204/2=102, or [101-103]/2= (-2)/2=-1. So yes, k=102.\n\nSo the answer is E) 102.\n",

So, it's an arithmetic sequence with a common difference d=1.\n\nThe formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is S = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference.\n\nIn this case, the sum S is 51, the first term a is -50, and d is 1. So plugging these into the formula:\n\n51 = k/2 * [2*(-50) + (k-1)*1]\n\nLet me compute that step by step. \n\nFirst, 2*(-50) is -100. Then, (k-1)*1 is just (k-1). Adding those together gives (-100 + k -1) = (k - 101). \n\nSo the equation becomes:\n51 = (k/2) * (k - 101)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n102 = k*(k - 101)\n\nExpanding the right side:\n102 = k\u00b2 - 101k\n\nBring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:\nk\u00b2 - 101k - 102 = 0\n\nHmm, I need to solve for k here. Let's try to factor this quadratic. Alternatively, I can use the quadratic formula. Let me see if it's factorable.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -102 and add up to -101. Wait, that's tricky. Let's see: factors of 102 are 1 and 102, 2 and 51, 3 and 34, 6 and 17. Hmm. Since the product is negative, one number is positive and the other is negative.\n\nWait, 102 is positive, but the product is -102. So maybe 102 and -1: 102 * (-1) = -102, and 102 + (-1) = 101. But our middle term is -101k, so when we factor, the signs would be opposite. Let me set up the factors.\n\nLooking for (k - a)(k + b) = 0, where a and b are positive numbers. Expanding gives k\u00b2 + (b -a)k -ab. We need ab = 102 and (b -a) = -101.\n\nWait, but (b -a) is -101, which would mean that a - b = 101. So a = b + 101. Then, ab = 102.\n\nSubstituting a = b +101 into ab=102:\n\n(b + 101)*b = 102\n\nb\u00b2 + 101b - 102 = 0\n\nHmm, that's another quadratic. Let me compute the discriminant: D = 101\u00b2 + 4*102 = 10201 + 408 = 10609. The square root of 10609 is... let me think. 103\u00b2 is 10609 because 100\u00b2=10000, 101\u00b2=10201, 102\u00b2=10404, 103\u00b2=10609. So sqrt(10609)=103.\n\nSo b = [-101 \u00b1103]/2.\n\nTaking the positive root because b must be positive: ( -101 +103 ) / 2 = 2/2 =1. So b=1, and a=1+101=102.\n\nSo the factors are (k -102)(k +1)=0. So k=102 or k=-1. But k can't be negative because it's the number of terms. So k=102.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me check that. If k is 102, then the series starts at -50 and has 102 terms. The last term would be a + (k-1)*d = -50 +101*1 =51. So the numbers go from -50 up to 51, inclusive. Let me compute the sum.\n\nThe average of the first and last term is (-50 +51)/2 = 0.5. Multiply by the number of terms (102) gives 0.5 *102=51. That's correct. So the sum is indeed 51.\n\nBut wait, I have to make sure that all the numbers are integers and consecutive. Yes, they are.\n\nSo the answer should be E) 102.\n\nBut wait, the options include E as 102. But let me check the options again.\n\nOptions: A)40, B)62, C)82, D)92, E)102.\n\nSo E is correct.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me think if I made any mistake in the quadratic solution. Let me retrace.\n\nThe quadratic equation was k\u00b2 -101k -102=0. Using the quadratic formula, k = [101 \u00b1 sqrt(101\u00b2 +4*102)] /2.\n\n101\u00b2 is 10201. 4*102 is 408. So sqrt(10201+408)=sqrt(10609)=103.\n\nSo k = [101 +103]/2 = 204/2=102, or [101-103]/2= (-2)/2=-1. So yes, k=102.\n\nSo the answer is E) 102.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the number of consecutive integers, \\( k \\), whose sum is 51, with the least integer being -50. Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, \\( S = \\frac{n}{2} \\cdot [2a + (n-1)d] \\), where \\( S = 51 \\), \\( a = -50 \\), and \\( d = 1 \\), the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n51 = \\frac{k}{2} \\cdot [2(-50) + (k-1)(1)]\n\\]\n\nSimplifying further:\n\n\\[\n51 = \\frac{k}{2} \\cdot (-100 + k - 1)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n51 = \\frac{k}{2} \\cdot (k - 101)\n\\]\n\nMultiplying through by 2:\n\n\\[\n102 = k(k - 101)\n\\]\n\nExpanding and rearranging:\n\n\\[\nk^2 - 101k - 102 = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, \\( k = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -101 \\), and \\( c = -102 \\), gives:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{101 \\pm \\sqrt{101^2 + 4 \\cdot 102}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{101 \\pm \\sqrt{10201 + 408}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{101 \\pm \\sqrt{10609}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{101 \\pm 103}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis yields two solutions: \\( k = \\frac{101 + 103}{2} = 102 \\) and \\( k = \\frac{101 - 103}{2} = -1 \\). Since \\( k \\) must be positive, \\( k = 102 \\).\n\nVerifying, the series starts at -50 and ends at 51, with 102 terms. The sum is consistent with the formula, confirming \\( k = 102 \\).\n\nAnswer: E",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. The least integer is -50, and I need to find k. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nWait, I remember that when you have consecutive integers, especially a sequence, the average multiplied by the number of terms gives the sum. Oh right, because the average of a set of consecutive numbers is the same as the middle term, or the average of the first and last term.\n\nSo the sum is 51, which is the product of the average and k. Let me write that down. Sum = average * k.\n\nThe average can also be calculated as (first term + last term)/2. Since the first term is -50, I need to find the last term. Let's denote the last term as L.\n\nSo, average = (-50 + L)/2. Then, the sum is average * k = [(-50 + L)/2] * k = 51.\n\nBut wait, I don't know L or k yet. I need another equation or way to relate these. Oh, right! The numbers are consecutive integers, so the difference between each term is 1. The number of terms, k, is equal to the difference between the last term and the first term plus 1. Because if you have, say, 3 terms: a, a+1, a+2. The last term is a+2, which is a + (3-1)*1. So, the formula is L = first term + (k -1)*1.\n\nSo, substituting that into the average equation: average = (-50 + (-50 + (k-1)))/2.\n\nWait, let me correct that. The first term is -50, and the last term is -50 + (k-1). Because each step adds 1, so after k-1 steps, you reach the last term.\n\nSo, average = [ (-50) + (-50 + (k-1)) ] / 2.\n\nSimplify that: (-50 -50 + k -1)/2 = (k - 101)/2.\n\nSo the average is (k-101)/2.\n\nThen, the sum is average * k = [(k-101)/2] * k =51.\n\nSo, (k(k-101))/2 =51.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: k(k-101) = 102.\n\nSo expanding that: k^2 -101k -102 =0.\n\nWait, wait, that would be k squared minus 101k equals 102, right? Because when you expand, it's k^2 -101k =102.\n\nSo the quadratic equation is k^2 -101k -102 =0.\n\nHmm, I need to solve for k. Let's try to factor this or use the quadratic formula.\n\nLet me think if this factors. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -102 and add to -101.\n\nWait, factors of 102 are 1 and 102, 2 and 51, 3 and 34, 6 and 17. Hmm.\n\nWait, because the product is -102, so one is positive and the other negative.\n\nLooking for two numbers that add to -101. So, let's see: 102 and 1. If I take 102 and -1: 102 * (-1) = -102. 102 + (-1) =101, but I need -101. So maybe 102 and -1, but the sum is 101, which is positive, so that's not it. Alternatively, perhaps the numbers are 101 and -1? Wait, 101 * (-1) = -101, but that's not -102. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use the quadratic formula here. The quadratic is k^2 -101k -102 =0.\n\nQuadratic formula: k = [101 \u00b1 sqrt(101^2 +4*102)] /2.\n\nCalculating the discriminant: 101^2 is 10201. 4*102 is 408. So sqrt(10201 +408) = sqrt(10609).\n\nWait, what's the square root of 10609? Let me think. 100 squared is 10000, 103 squared is 10609. Because 100^2=10000, 101^2=10201, 102^2=10404, 103^2=10609. Yes, because 103 *103: 100*100=10000, 100*3=300, 3*100=300, 3*3=9. So 10000 +300+300+9=10609.\n\nSo sqrt(10609)=103.\n\nSo, k = [101 \u00b1103]/2.\n\nSo two possibilities: (101 +103)/2 = 204/2=102, and (101-103)/2= (-2)/2= -1.\n\nBut k can't be negative, since it's the number of terms. So k=102.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 102. So is that the answer?\n\nWait a second, let me double-check. If k is 102, then the last term is -50 + (102-1) = -50 +101=51. So the sequence goes from -50 to 51, inclusive.\n\nWait, let me compute the sum. The average is (-50 +51)/2= 1/2=0.5. So sum is 0.5 *102=51. Yep, that checks out.\n\nSo the answer is E)102.\n\nWait, but wait another thought: the options include 102 as E. So that's the correct answer. But let me think again.\n\nWait, the sum of numbers from -50 to 51. How many numbers is that?\n\nWait, the number of integers from -50 to 51 inclusive is 51 - (-50) +1 =51+50+1=102. So yes, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, the sum is 51. Let me compute that sum another way. The sum from -50 to 50 is zero, because each positive and negative cancels out. Then the sum from 51 is 51. So total sum is 51. So that's correct. So k is 102.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to figure this problem out. So, the question is about finding the value of k, which is the number of consecutive integers that add up to 51. The smallest integer in this sequence is -50. Hmm, I remember that the sum of consecutive integers can be calculated using the formula for an arithmetic series. \n\nWait, right, the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence is S = n/2 * (a1 + an), where n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term. But in this case, we don't know the last term or the number of terms. Oh, but we do know the sum is 51 and the first term is -50. \n\nSo, maybe I can express the last term in terms of k. Since the integers are consecutive, each term increases by 1. So the sequence would be -50, -49, -48, ..., up to some number. Let me think, the nth term of an arithmetic sequence can be found using a_n = a_1 + (n-1)*d, where d is the common difference. Here, d is 1 because they're consecutive integers. So the last term, a_k, is -50 + (k-1)*1, which simplifies to a_k = -50 + k -1 = k -51.\n\nNow, the sum S is 51, so plugging into the sum formula: S = k/2 * (a1 + a_k). Substituting the values, 51 = (k/2) * (-50 + (k-51)). Let me compute that inside the parentheses. -50 + k -51 is k - 101. So now the equation is 51 = (k/2) * (k - 101).\n\nLet me write that out: 51 = (k (k - 101)) / 2. Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the denominator: 102 = k(k - 101). That gives me a quadratic equation: k^2 - 101k - 102 = 0.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me make sure I did that correctly. Oh yeah, because 51 multiplied by 2 is 102. So 102 equals k(k-101). Expanding that, it's k squared minus 101k, right. So the quadratic is k^2 -101k -102 = 0. Hmm, solving this quadratic equation for k.\n\nI can try using the quadratic formula. The quadratic equation is ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, so a=1, b=-101, c=-102. The formula is k = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)] / (2a). Plugging in the values: \n\nb squared is (-101)^2 = 10201. 4ac is 4*1*(-102) = -408. So the discriminant is 10201 - (-408)*1? Wait, no. Wait, the discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. So that's 10201 - (4 * 1 * (-102)) = 10201 + 408 = 10609. What's the square root of 10609? Hmm, I think 103 squared is 10609 because 100^2 is 10000, 101 is 10201, 102 is 10404, 103 is 10609. Oh, yes, 103^2 is 10609.\n\nSo sqrt(10609)=103. Now, the solutions are [101 \u00b1103]/2. Let's compute both possibilities.\n\nFirst, [101 + 103]/2 = 204/2=102. Second, [101-103]/2 = (-2)/2 = -1.\n\nBut k represents the number of terms, so it can't be negative. So k=102. Looking at the options, E is 102. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me check. Let me make sure that the sum of 102 terms starting from -50 adds up to 51. Because 102 is a big number, maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nThe first term is -50, the last term is a_102 = -50 + 101 = 51. So the sum is (102/2) * (-50 +51) = 51 * 1 =51. Oh, that's correct. So yes, k is 102. So the correct answer is E.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's try to figure this problem out. So, the question is about finding the value of k, which is the number of consecutive integers that add up to 51. The smallest integer in this sequence is -50. Hmm, I remember that the sum of consecutive integers can be calculated using the formula for an arithmetic series. \n\nWait, right, the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence is S = n/2 * (a1 + an), where n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term. But in this case, we don't know the last term or the number of terms. Oh, but we do know the sum is 51 and the first term is -50. \n\nSo, maybe I can express the last term in terms of k. Since the integers are consecutive, each term increases by 1. So the sequence would be -50, -49, -48, ..., up to some number. Let me think, the nth term of an arithmetic sequence can be found using a_n = a_1 + (n-1)*d, where d is the common difference. Here, d is 1 because they're consecutive integers. So the last term, a_k, is -50 + (k-1)*1, which simplifies to a_k = -50 + k -1 = k -51.\n\nNow, the sum S is 51, so plugging into the sum formula: S = k/2 * (a1 + a_k). Substituting the values, 51 = (k/2) * (-50 + (k-51)). Let me compute that inside the parentheses. -50 + k -51 is k - 101. So now the equation is 51 = (k/2) * (k - 101).\n\nLet me write that out: 51 = (k (k - 101)) / 2. Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the denominator: 102 = k(k - 101). That gives me a quadratic equation: k^2 - 101k - 102 = 0.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me make sure I did that correctly. Oh yeah, because 51 multiplied by 2 is 102. So 102 equals k(k-101). Expanding that, it's k squared minus 101k, right. So the quadratic is k^2 -101k -102 = 0. Hmm, solving this quadratic equation for k.\n\nI can try using the quadratic formula.

Plugging in the values: \n\nb squared is (-101)^2 = 10201. 4ac is 4*1*(-102) = -408. So the discriminant is 10201 - (-408)*1? Wait, no. Wait, the discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. So that's 10201 - (4 * 1 * (-102)) = 10201 + 408 = 10609. What's the square root of 10609? Hmm, I think 103 squared is 10609 because 100^2 is 10000, 101 is 10201, 102 is 10404, 103 is 10609. Oh, yes, 103^2 is 10609.\n\nSo sqrt(10609)=103. Now, the solutions are [101 \u00b1103]/2. Let's compute both possibilities.\n\nFirst, [101 + 103]/2 = 204/2=102.

The least integer is -50. We need to find k from the options given.\n\nHmm, okay. So, I remember that the sum of consecutive integers can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. Since these are consecutive integers, the common difference is 1. So, the formula should be applicable here.\n\nWait, what's the formula again? Oh right, the sum S of n terms with the first term a1 and last term an is S = n*(a1 + an)/2. Alternatively, since the terms are consecutive, the last term can be expressed as a1 + (n-1)*d, where d is the common difference, which is 1 here.\n\nSo, in this problem, the sum S is 51. The first term a1 is -50. And we need to find n, which is k here. Let me write down the variables:\n\nS = 51\na1 = -50\nd = 1\nn = k\nan = a1 + (n-1)*d = -50 + (k-1)*1 = -50 +k -1 = k -51\n\nSo the last term is k-51.\n\nNow, plug into the sum formula:\n\n51 = k * (a1 + an)/2\n51 = k * (-50 + (k -51)) / 2\n\nLet me simplify the numerator inside the parentheses:\n\n-50 + (k -51) = k -51 -50 = k -101\n\nSo now the equation becomes:\n\n51 = k*(k -101)/2\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n102 = k*(k -101)\n\nSo, expanding the right side:\n\n102 = k\u00b2 -101k\n\nBring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:\n\nk\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0\n\nWait, wait. Let me check that. Because 102 is on the left, so when moving to the right, it becomes negative.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-do the step:\n\nStarting from 102 = k\u00b2 -101k\n\nSubtract 102 from both sides:\n\nk\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation for k. Quadratic equation is of the form ax\u00b2 +bx +c =0, so a=1, b=-101, c=-102.\n\nThe quadratic formula is k = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nb\u00b2 is (101)^2 = 10201\n4ac is 4*1*(-102) = -408\nSo discriminant D = 10201 -4*1*(-102) = 10201 + 408 = 10609\n\nWhat's the square root of 10609? Let me think. Hmm, 100 squared is 10000, 103 squared is 10609 because 100^2 is 10000, 103^2 is (100+3)^2 = 10000 + 600 +9 = 10609. So sqrt(10609) is 103.\n\nSo, k = [101 \u00b1103]/2\n\nSo two possibilities:\n\nk = (101 +103)/2 = 204/2 = 102\n\nk = (101 -103)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1\n\nBut k is the number of terms, so it can't be negative. So k must be 102.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 102. So that's one of the choices. But wait, I should double-check my calculations because sometimes when I think I've got it, I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let's re-express the sum formula correctly. Another way to compute the sum is using the formula:\n\nSum = (number of terms) * (first term + last term) / 2\n\nBut I also remember another formula for the sum of consecutive integers starting from a: Sum = n*(2a + (n-1)d)/2. Since d=1, it becomes n*(2a +n-1)/2.\n\nWait, let me try that approach.\n\nSum = n*(2a1 + (n-1)*d)/2\n\nGiven a1 = -50, d=1, sum is 51.\n\nSo,\n\n51 = n*(2*(-50) + (n-1)*1)/2\n\nSimplify:\n\n51 = n*(-100 + n -1)/2\n\n51 = n*(n-101)/2\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n102 = n(n-101)\n\nWhich is the same as n\u00b2 -101n -102 =0, same as before.\n\nSo the quadratic is correct, leading to n=102 or -1. So the answer should be 102.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Wait, when we have a series starting at a negative number and adding positive numbers, the sum could be achieved with a larger number of terms. But I'm getting 102 terms. Let me see if that makes sense.\n\nLet me calculate the sum of 102 terms starting at -50. The last term would be a1 + (k-1)*d = -50 +101 = 51.\n\nWait, so the sum is from -50 to 51 inclusive. How many terms is that?\n\nWait, wait. The number of terms from -50 to 51: let's compute. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a +1. So 51 - (-50) +1 = 51 +50 +1=102. So yes, 102 terms.\n\nWhat's the sum of these numbers? Let's see. The sum is (number of terms) * (first + last)/2. So 102 * (-50 +51)/2 =102*(1)/2=51. Which matches the given sum. So yes, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, the options given are A)40, B)62, C)82, D)92, E)102.\n\nSo E is 102, which is the answer.\n\nWait, but why is there an option B)62? Could I have messed up the calculation somewhere? Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: the sum is 51. Starting from -50. Let's think about how many terms would be needed to reach a sum of 51.\n\nWait, the sequence starts at -50, which is negative, and each next term is +1. So the sequence is -50, -49, -48,..., 0, 1, 2,..., up to some number.\n\nThe sum of consecutive integers from -n to n is zero, because the negatives and positives cancel out. So in this case, from -50 to 50, the sum is zero. So to get a sum of 51, we need to go beyond 50 by enough terms.\n\nSo, from -50 to 50, sum is zero. Then, adding 51, 52,... up to m, so that the sum of 51 to m is 51.\n\nWait, wait. No, because the sum of all terms from -50 to m must be 51. Let me model this.\n\nWait, the sum from -50 to m is the sum from 1 to m plus the sum from -50 to 0.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute the sum from a to b as (b(b+1)/2) - ((a-1)a)/2, but that's for positive numbers. Alternatively, the sum from -50 to m is sum from -50 to m = sum from 1 to m + sum from -50 to 0.\n\nSum from -50 to 0 is the same as sum from 0 to -50, which is the same as negative of sum from 1 to 49, because 0 doesn't contribute. Wait, no: the sum from -50 to 0 is (-50) + (-49) + ... + (-1) +0. So that's the same as -(50 +49 +...+1). The sum 1+2+...+n is n(n+1)/2. So 50*51/2=1275. So sum from -50 to 0 is -1275.\n\nThen, the sum from -50 to m is sum from -50 to 0 plus sum from 1 to m.\n\nSo, sum = (-1275) + (m(m+1)/2)\n\nWe know that this sum should be 51.\n\nSo,\n\n-1275 + [m(m+1)/2] = 51\n\nAdding 1275 to both sides:\n\nm(m+1)/2 = 51 +1275 = 1326\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\nm(m+1) = 2652\n\nNow, we need to find m such that m(m+1) =2652.\n\nHmm, let's approximate. Let's take square root of 2652. What is 51^2=2601, 52^2=2704. So m is between 51 and 52. Let's try m=51: 51*52=2652. Yes, exactly.\n\nSo m=51.\n\nSo the sequence runs from -50 to 51, inclusive. The number of terms is 51 - (-50) +1 =51 +50 +1=102.\n\nSo k=102, which is option E.\n\nSo I think that's correct. So the answer should be E)102.\n",

Let me think. Hmm, 100 squared is 10000, 103 squared is 10609 because 100^2 is 10000, 103^2 is (100+3)^2 = 10000 + 600 +9 = 10609. So sqrt(10609) is 103.\n\nSo, k = [101 \u00b1103]/2\n\nSo two possibilities:\n\nk = (101 +103)/2 = 204/2 = 102\n\nk = (101 -103)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1\n\nBut k is the number of terms, so it can't be negative. So k must be 102.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 102. So that's one of the choices. But wait, I should double-check my calculations because sometimes when I think I've got it, I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let's re-express the sum formula correctly. Another way to compute the sum is using the formula:\n\nSum = (number of terms) * (first term + last term) / 2\n\nBut I also remember another formula for the sum of consecutive integers starting from a: Sum = n*(2a + (n-1)d)/2. Since d=1, it becomes n*(2a +n-1)/2.\n\nWait, let me try that approach.\n\nSum = n*(2a1 + (n-1)*d)/2\n\nGiven a1 = -50, d=1, sum is 51.\n\nSo,\n\n51 = n*(2*(-50) + (n-1)*1)/2\n\nSimplify:\n\n51 = n*(-100 + n -1)/2\n\n51 = n*(n-101)/2\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n102 = n(n-101)\n\nWhich is the same as n\u00b2 -101n -102 =0, same as before.\n\nSo the quadratic is correct, leading to n=102 or -1. So the answer should be 102.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Wait, when we have a series starting at a negative number and adding positive numbers, the sum could be achieved with a larger number of terms. But I'm getting 102 terms. Let me see if that makes sense.\n\nLet me calculate the sum of 102 terms starting at -50. The last term would be a1 + (k-1)*d = -50 +101 = 51.\n\nWait, so the sum is from -50 to 51 inclusive. How many terms is that?\n\nWait, wait. The number of terms from -50 to 51: let's compute. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a +1. So 51 - (-50) +1 = 51 +50 +1=102. So yes, 102 terms.\n\nWhat's the sum of these numbers? Let's see. The sum is (number of terms) * (first + last)/2. So 102 * (-50 +51)/2 =102*(1)/2=51. Which matches the given sum. So yes, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, the options given are A)40, B)62, C)82, D)92, E)102.\n\nSo E is 102, which is the answer.\n\nWait, but why is there an option B)62? Could I have messed up the calculation somewhere? Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: the sum is 51. Starting from -50. Let's think about how many terms would be needed to reach a sum of 51.\n\nWait, the sequence starts at -50, which is negative, and each next term is +1. So the sequence is -50, -49, -48,..., 0, 1, 2,..., up to some number.\n\nThe sum of consecutive integers from -n to n is zero, because the negatives and positives cancel out. So in this case, from -50 to 50, the sum is zero. So to get a sum of 51, we need to go beyond 50 by enough terms.\n\nSo, from -50 to 50, sum is zero. Then, adding 51, 52,... up to m, so that the sum of 51 to m is 51.\n\nWait, wait. No, because the sum of all terms from -50 to m must be 51. Let me model this.\n\nWait, the sum from -50 to m is the sum from 1 to m plus the sum from -50 to 0.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute the sum from a to b as (b(b+1)/2) - ((a-1)a)/2, but that's for positive numbers. Alternatively, the sum from -50 to m is sum from -50 to m = sum from 1 to m + sum from -50 to 0.\n\nSum from -50 to 0 is the same as sum from 0 to -50, which is the same as negative of sum from 1 to 49, because 0 doesn't contribute. Wait, no: the sum from -50 to 0 is (-50) + (-49) + ... + (-1) +0. So that's the same as -(50 +49 +...+1). The sum 1+2+...+n is n(n+1)/2. So 50*51/2=1275. So sum from -50 to 0 is -1275.\n\nThen, the sum from -50 to m is sum from -50 to 0 plus sum from 1 to m.\n\nSo, sum = (-1275) + (m(m+1)/2)\n\nWe know that this sum should be 51.\n\nSo,\n\n-1275 + [m(m+1)/2] = 51\n\nAdding 1275 to both sides:\n\nm(m+1)/2 = 51 +1275 = 1326\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\nm(m+1) = 2652\n\nNow, we need to find m such that m(m+1) =2652.\n\nHmm, let's approximate. Let's take square root of 2652. What is 51^2=2601, 52^2=2704. So m is between 51 and 52. Let's try m=51: 51*52=2652. Yes, exactly.\n\nSo m=51.\n\nSo the sequence runs from -50 to 51, inclusive. The number of terms is 51 - (-50) +1 =51 +50 +1=102.\n\nSo k=102, which is option E.\n\nSo I think that's correct. So the answer should be E)102.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we calculate the sum of \\( k \\) consecutive integers starting from \\(-50\\) and set it equal to 51. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{n}{2} \\cdot (a_1 + a_n)\n\\]\n\nHere:\n- \\( S = 51 \\) (the sum),\n- \\( a_1 = -50 \\) (the first term),\n- \\( a_n = a_1 + (k-1)d \\), where \\( d = 1 \\) (common difference),\n- \\( a_n = -50 + (k-1) = k - 51 \\).\n\nSubstituting into the sum formula:\n\n\\[\n51 = \\frac{k}{2} \\cdot (-50 + (k - 51))\n\\]\n\nSimplify the expression inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[\n-50 + (k - 51) = k - 101\n\\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n51 = \\frac{k}{2} \\cdot (k - 101)\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n102 = k \\cdot (k - 101)\n\\]\n\nExpanding and rearranging terms:\n\n\\[\nk^2 - 101k - 102 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -101 \\), and \\( c = -102 \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where the sum of k consecutive integers is 51, and the least integer is -50. I need to find what k is. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nAlright, I remember that the sum of consecutive integers can be calculated using the formula for an arithmetic series. Since they are consecutive, the common difference is 1. So, the formula for the sum S of n terms where the first term is a and the last term is l is S = n/2 * (a + l). \n\nIn this problem, the sum S is 51, the first term a is -50, and the number of terms is k. The last term would be the (k)th term, which can be expressed as a + (k-1)*d. Since d is 1 (because they are consecutive integers), the last term l is -50 + (k-1)*1 = -50 + k -1 = k -51.\n\nSo, putting these into the sum formula: 51 = k/2 * [(-50) + (k -51)]. Let me write that down:\n\n51 = (k/2) * (-50 + k -51)\nSimplify the terms inside the brackets: -50 -51 is -101, so it's (k - 101).\n\nSo the equation becomes 51 = (k/2)(k - 101). Let's multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n102 = k(k - 101)\nExpanding the right side: 102 = k\u00b2 -101k.\n\nNow, rearranging to form a quadratic equation: k\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0.\n\nWait, that's a quadratic equation in terms of k. Let me see if I can factor this. Alternatively, I can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic is k\u00b2 -101k -102 =0.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, k = [101 \u00b1 sqrt( (101)^2 + 4*1*102 ) ] / 2.\n\nCalculating the discriminant: 101\u00b2 is 10201, and 4*1*102 is 408. So discriminant is 10201 +408 = 10609.\n\nWhat's the square root of 10609? Hmm, let me think. 100\u00b2 is 10000, 103\u00b2 is 10609 because 103*103 is 10609. Oh right, so sqrt(10609)=103.\n\nSo, k = [101 \u00b1103 ] /2.\n\nSo two possible solutions: (101 +103)/2 = 204/2=102, and (101-103)/2= (-2)/2= -1.\n\nBut k can't be negative because it's the number of terms. So k=102. Wait, but looking at the options, E is 102.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Did I make a mistake in the calculations? Let me go through again.\n\nWait, the sum is 51, the first term is -50, and k terms. The last term is (-50 + (k-1)*1) = k-51.\n\nSo sum is (k/2)*(-50 + (k-51)) = (k/2)*(k-101). So 51= (k)(k-101)/2.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: 102 =k(k-101), which is k\u00b2 -101k -102=0.\n\nQuadratic formula: [101 \u00b1 sqrt( (101)^2 +4*102 ) ] / 2.\n\nWait wait, wait a minute. 4*102 is 408, and 101^2 is 10201. So the discriminant is 10201 +408=10609. Square root is 103.\n\nSo k= [101 +103]/2= 204/2=102, and [101-103]/2= (-2)/2= -1. So yeah, k=102.\n\nBut wait, let me check if that makes sense. So if k=102, the series starts at -50 and ends at -50 +101=51. Because the last term is a + (k-1)*d. So that's -50 +101 =51. So the sum is (102/2)*(-50 +51) =51*(1)=51. That matches. So yes, k=102.\n\nBut wait, let me think about the options. The options are A)40, B)62, C)82, D)92, E)102. So E is correct. But wait, the problem says \"the least integer is -50\", which would be the first term. So starting at -50 and ending at 51, that's 102 numbers.\n\nHmm, but wait, let me think again. If k=102, the last term is 51, and the sum is 51. So that's correct. So the answer should be E)102.\n\nWait, but why are the other options even there? Let me see if perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nAlternative approach: The sum can be calculated as the average multiplied by the number of terms. The average of an arithmetic sequence is (first + last)/2. So sum is average * k.\n\nSo sum = 51 = k*( (-50 + (last term)) ) / 2.\n\nWait, last term is -50 + (k-1)*1= k-51.\n\nSo sum is k*( (-50 + k -51 ) ) /2 = k*(k -101)/2.\n\nSo 51 = [k(k-101)]/2.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: 102 = k(k-101). So k^2 -101k -102=0.\n\nSame as before. So same result.\n\nSo why are the other options like 40,62, etc. present? Maybe I should check if I miscalculated the last term.\n\nWait, let me think: the first term is -50, and k consecutive terms. So the terms are -50, -49, ..., up to (-50 + (k-1)).\n\nSo last term is (-50 +k -1) =k-51.\n\nSo the sum is (k/2)(-50 + (k-51)) = (k/2)(k-101).\n\nYes, that's correct. So 51= (k(k-101))/2.\n\nSo I think my approach is correct. So the answer must be E)102.\n\nWait a second, but 102 seems like a lot of terms. Let me think about what the sum would be. Starting at -50, adding 102 terms: each term increases by 1. So the sum is the same as the average of the first and last term multiplied by the number of terms.\n\nThe first term is -50, last is 51. So average is ( -50 +51 )/2 = 1/2 = 0.5. Multiply by 102 terms: 0.5*102=51. Exactly the sum given. So that's correct.\n\nSo I think I didn't make a mistake. So the answer is E)102.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. The least integer is -50. I need to find k. Hmm. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nAlright, I remember that the sum of consecutive integers can be found using the formula for an arithmetic series. Since these are consecutive integers, the common difference is 1. So the series is like -50, -49, -48, ..., up to some number.\n\nWait, the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is S = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference. Alternatively, I've also heard it as S = n * (a1 + an)/2, where a1 is the first term and an is the last term.\n\nIn this problem, the sum S is 51, the first term a is -50, and d is 1. So I can set up the equation using one of these formulas.\n\nLet me try using the first formula: S = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d]. Plugging in the known values:\n\n51 = k/2 * [2*(-50) + (k-1)*1]\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n2*(-50) is -100, and (k-1)*1 is k-1. So the equation becomes:\n\n51 = (k/2) * (-100 + k -1)\n51 = (k/2) * (k - 101)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n102 = k*(k - 101)\n\nSo that gives a quadratic equation: k^2 -101k -102 = 0.\n\nWait, wait. Let me check that. Expanding k*(k-101) gives k\u00b2 -101k. So 102 = k\u00b2 -101k. Rearranging: k\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0.\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation for k. Let me see if I can factor it or if I need to use the quadratic formula.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -102 and add up to -101. Hmm, factors of 102 are 1 & 102, 2 &51, 3 &34, 6 &17. Since the product is negative, one number is positive and the other is negative.\n\nLet me think: 102 is 102*1, so perhaps 102 and -1: 102*(-1) = -102, and 102 + (-1) = 101. Wait, but in the equation, the middle term is -101k, so maybe the numbers are 102 and -1. So the equation would factor as (k -102)(k +1) = 0.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\n(k -102)(k +1) = k\u00b2 +k -102k -102 = k\u00b2 -101k -102. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the solutions are k=102 or k=-1. But since k is the number of terms, it can't be negative. So k=102.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. If the first term is -50 and there are 102 terms, the last term would be -50 + (102-1)*1 = -50 + 101 = 51. So the series goes from -50 to 51.\n\nWait, the sum would be the average of the first and last term multiplied by the number of terms. So average is (-50 +51)/2 = 0.5. Sum is 102 * 0.5 = 51. That's correct. So k is 102.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 102. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The options given are A)40, B)62, C)82, D)92, E)102. So E is an option. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the quadratic equation.\n\nWait, when I set up the equation, I had 51 = (k/2)(k - 101). Let me confirm the expansion again.\n\nWait, 2a is 2*(-50) = -100. Then (k-1)*1 is k-1. So 2a + (k-1)d = -100 + (k-1) = k -101. So yes, the equation is correct.\n\nSo k^2 -101k -102=0. Factored as (k - 102)(k +1) =0. So k=102 or k=-1. Only 102 is valid.\n\nSo the answer is E)102.\n",

So that's the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about this is by using the formula for the sum of consecutive numbers. Let me see if that gives the same result.\n\nAlternatively, the sum can be expressed as (number of terms) multiplied by the average of the first and last term. So same as before.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think about it numerically. If k is 102, the first term is -50, the last term is -50 + 101 = 51. Because each term increases by 1, so 102 terms would go from -50 to (-50 +101) =51.\n\nThen the sum is 102 * ( (-50 +51)/2 ) = 102*(1/2) )= 102*(0.5) =51. Which matches the given sum. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer is E)102.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The sum \\( S \\) of \\( k \\) consecutive integers is given by:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{k}{2} \\cdot (a_1 + a_k)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( a_1 \\) is the first term and \\( a_k \\) is the last term. Here, \\( S = 51 \\), \\( a_1 = -50 \\), and \\( a_k = a_1 + (k-1) \\cdot 1 = -50 + k - 1 = k - 51 \\). Substituting these into the formula:\n\n\\[\n51 = \\frac{k}{2} \\cdot (-50 + (k - 51))\n\\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\\[\n51 = \\frac{k}{2} \\cdot (k - 101)\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n102 = k(k - 101)\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\nk^2 - 101k - 102 = 0\n\\]\n\nFactoring the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\n(k + 1)(k - 102) = 0\n\\]\n\nThe solutions are \\( k = -1 \\) or \\( k = 102 \\). Since \\( k \\) represents the number of terms, it cannot be negative. Thus, \\( k = 102 \\).\n\nTo verify, if \\( k = 102 \\), the sequence starts at \\( -50 \\) and ends at \\( 51 \\) (since \\( -50 + 101 = 51 \\)). The sum is:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{102}{2} \\cdot (-50 + 51) = 51 \\cdot 1 = 51\n\\]\n\nThis matches the given sum. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: E**",
