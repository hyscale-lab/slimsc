      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question says there are 10 oranges in a basket, and we need to find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from the basket. The options are given as A)45, B)90, C)120, D)150, E)180.\n\nHmm, I remember that when the order doesn't matter in selection, it's a combination problem. Oh right, combinations are used when the order doesn't matter, unlike permutations where the order does matter. So, choosing 2 oranges out of 10 where the order doesn't matter would be a combination.\n\nThe formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n! divided by (k! times (n-k)!)). So in this case, n is 10 and k is 2.\n\nLet me compute that. 10 choose 2. So, 10! / (2! * (10-2)! ). Wait, 10-2 is 8, so that becomes 10! / (2! * 8! ).\n\nBut wait, 10! is 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8! So when I write it out, 10! = 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8! and 8! cancels out with the denominator's 8!. So that leaves us with (10 \u00d7 9) / (2 \u00d7 1). Because 2! is 2\u00d71.\n\nSo, (10 \u00d79) is 90, divided by 2 is 45. So 45 ways. So the answer should be option A)45.\n\nWait, let me think again. Does that make sense? If I have 10 oranges, the number of ways to pick 2 should be 45. Yeah, because for each orange, you pair it with the next ones. Like the first orange can pair with 9 others, the second with 8, but wait no, that approach would overcount. Because choosing orange 1 and 2 is the same as 2 and 1. So that's why we use combinations, to avoid that.\n\nAlternatively, the formula gives us 45, which is the correct number. So yeah, the answer should be A)45.\n",

Find the number of ways in which 2 oranges are chosen from the basket? The options are A)45, B)90, C)120, D)150, E)180.\n\nHmm, I think this is a combinatorics problem. So, when you're choosing items from a group without considering the order, it's a combination problem.

And k is 2 since we're choosing two.\n\nLet me plug the numbers into the formula. So, 10 choose 2 would be 10! divided by (2! times (10-2)! ).

Because choosing orange A and then orange B is the same as choosing B and then A when you're just selecting two.\n\nSo the formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n! divided by (k! times (n-k)!). Right, that's the formula. Here, n is 10 because there are 10 oranges, and k is 2 since we're choosing two.\n\nLet me plug the numbers in. So 10 choose 2 would be 10! divided by (2! times (10-2)! ). Wait, 10-2 is 8, so that's 8!. Let me compute this step by step.\n\nBut wait, calculating factorials can get big, but maybe I can simplify it. 10! is 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8! and the denominator has 2! times 8!. Oh right, so the 8! cancels out from numerator and denominator. So it's (10 \u00d79 \u00d78! ) / (2! \u00d7 8! ) \u2192 which simplifies to (10 \u00d79 ) / 2! \n\nAnd 2! is 2 \u00d71, which is 2. So now it's (90)/2, which is 45. So the number of ways is 45.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 45. So that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't mix up anything. Oh wait, sometimes people confuse combinations with permutations. Permutations would be if the order mattered, but in this case, whether I pick orange 1 first or orange 2 first doesn't matter. So combinations are correct here.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the first orange can be any of the 10, and the second any of the remaining 9. So 10 \u00d79 =90. But since each pair is counted twice (once as AB and once as BA), I need to divide by 2. So 90/2=45 again. Yep, same result. So definitely, the answer is A.\n",
