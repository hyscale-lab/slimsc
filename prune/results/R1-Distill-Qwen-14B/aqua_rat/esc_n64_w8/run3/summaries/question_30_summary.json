The question says, \"When I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age. Now I am 60 years old, how old is my brother?\" And there are five options to choose from.\n\nHmm. Let me think. So, the key here is to determine the age difference between me and my brother. Because once I know the age difference, I can figure out his current age based on my current age.\n\nAlright, so when I was 2, my brother was half my age. That means when I was 2, he was 1 year old. Wait, because half of 2 is 1. So at that time, I was older than him by 1 year. Because 2 minus 1 is 1. So the age difference between us is 1 year, right?\n\nWait, but age differences stay constant over time. So if I'm older by 1 year, that difference remains the same as I grow older. So if I'm now 60, he must be 60 minus 1, which is 59. So his age would be 59 years old.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 59. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me double-check. So when I was 2, he was 1. So the difference is 1 year. So as I get older, that difference remains. So when I'm 60, he's 60 minus 1, which is 59. That makes sense. So yes, option A is correct.\n",

Because age differences usually stay the same over time, right? So the key is to figure out how much older my brother is than me, or vice versa.\n\nWait, let's break it down. When I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age. So at that time, my age was 2, and his age was 2 divided by 2, which is 1. So when I was 2, he was 1.\n\nSo the age difference between me and my brother is 2 - 1 = 1 year. That means I'm 1 year older than him, right?

Since age differences remain constant over time, the brother is always 1 year younger than you. Now that you are 60 years old, your brother's age is 60 - 1 = 59 years old.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question says, \"When I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age. Now I am 60 years old, how old is my brother?\" The options are A)59, B)69, C)79, D)89, E)99.\n\nHmm, I think I need to find the age difference between me and my brother. Because age differences usually stay the same over time, right? So the key is to figure out how much older my brother is than me, or vice versa.\n\nWait, let's break it down. When I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age. So at that time, my age was 2, and his age was 2 divided by 2, which is 1. So when I was 2, he was 1.\n\nSo the age difference between me and my brother is 2 - 1 = 1 year. That means I'm 1 year older than him, right? Because when I was 2, he was 1, so he was younger by one year.\n\nNow, I'm 60 years old. Since the age difference remains the same, my brother should be 60 minus 1, which is 59. So his age now would be 59.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't mix it up. If I'm older, then subtracting the difference gives his age. So 60 (my current age) minus 1 (the difference) equals 59. That makes sense.\n\nSo looking at the options, option A is 59. So the correct answer should be A.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Because sometimes people get confused about who is older. Let me visualize the timeline. \n\nAt time T1: I was 2, brother was 1. So I'm older. The difference is +1 year for me.\n\nAt current time T2: I'm 60. So brother is 60 - 1 =59. So yes, 59 is correct.\n\n\nThe age difference between you and your brother is determined by the information provided. When you were 2 years old, your brother was half your age, which means he was 1 year old at that time. This establishes an age difference of 1 year, with you being older. Since age differences remain constant over time, the brother is always 1 year younger than you. Now that you are 60 years old, your brother's age is 60 - 1 = 59 years old.
