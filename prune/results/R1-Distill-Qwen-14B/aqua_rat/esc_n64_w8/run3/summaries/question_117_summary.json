      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a business partnership, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nSo, A starts a business with Rs.40,000. Two months later, B joins with Rs.60,000. Then, C joins them after some more time with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. I need to find out how many months after B joined did C join the business.\n\nHmm, okay. So this is a problem about profit sharing in a business based on the time each person has invested and the capital they've contributed. I remember that when partners invest different amounts and for different durations, their profits are divided in the ratio of their investments multiplied by the time they were invested.\n\nLet me break it down. First, I should figure out the time each person has been in the business. The total time is a year, which is 12 months.\n\nA started first. So A's investment is for the entire year, right? Because the problem says \"at the end of the year.\" So A's time is 12 months.\n\nB joined after 2 months. So B's investment is there for the remaining months of the year. Wait, how many months is that? If A started and B joined after 2 months, then from the start of the year, B is in for 10 months (since 12-2=10). So B's time is 10 months.\n\nC joined after some more time after B. Let's denote the number of months after B joined that C joined as x. So, from the start, C joined at 2 + x months. But wait, how much time did C have in the business? Since the year ends after 12 months, C's time is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months.\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that. If B joined after 2 months, and C joined after some time after B. So the time between B joining and C joining is x months. So C's time in the business would be (12 - (2 + x)) months. Because from the start, B is at month 2, C is at month 2 + x. So the time C is in is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months.\n\nWait, but if C joined x months after B, then from the start, C's time is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months. So yes.\n\nSo each person's investment is multiplied by their time. So the profit ratio is (A's investment * A's time) : (B's investment * B's time) : (C's investment * C's time).\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12\nB: 60,000 * (10)  [because 12 - 2 =10]\nC: 120,000 * (10 -x)\n\nWait, let me make sure. A is in for 12 months, correct. B is in for 10 months. C is in for (12 - (2 + x)) = 10 - x months. So yes.\n\nSo the ratio of their contributions is:\n\nA : B : C = (40,000 *12) : (60,000 *10) : (120,000 *(10 -x))\n\nWe can simplify this ratio by dividing each term by 10,000 to make it easier.\n\nSo,\n\nA : B : C = (4*12) : (6*10) : (12*(10 -x))\nWhich is 48 : 60 : 12*(10 -x)\n\nSimplify further by dividing each term by 12:\n\nA : B : C = 4 : 5 : (10 -x)\n\nWait, 48 /12 =4, 60/12=5, 12*(10-x)/12 = (10 -x). So yes.\n\nNow, the total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. So we can find out the proportion of C's share in the total profit.\n\nThe total profit is divided according to the ratio. So the sum of the ratios is 4 +5 + (10 -x) = 19 -x.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me compute the sum correctly.\n\nWait, 4 +5 + (10 -x) = 4 +5 is 9, plus 10 is 19, minus x. So sum is 19 -x.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the sum is 4 +5 + (10 -x) = 4+5=9, plus 10 is 19, minus x. So 19 -x.\n\nHmm, but wait, the sum of the ratios is 4 +5 + (10 -x) = 19 -x.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the total profit is divided into 19 -x parts. C's share is (10 -x)/(19 -x) * total profit.\n\nWait, the total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000.\n\nSo,\n\nC's share = [ (10 -x) / (19 -x) ] * 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nLet me write this equation:\n\n(10 - x)/(19 -x) * 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nDivide both sides by 375,000:\n\n(10 - x)/(19 -x) = 150,000 / 375,000.\n\nSimplify the right side: 150,000 / 375,000 = 2/5.\n\nSo,\n\n(10 - x)/(19 -x) = 2/5.\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n5*(10 -x) = 2*(19 -x)\n\nCompute each side:\n\n50 -5x = 38 -2x.\n\nBring variables to one side and constants to the other:\n\n50 -38 =5x -2x.\n\n12 =3x.\n\nSo x=4.\n\nSo x is 4 months. But wait, what does x represent?\n\nWait, x is the number of months after B joined that C joined. So if x is 4, then C joined 4 months after B.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations.\n\nSo, equation:\n\n(10 -x)/(19 -x) = 2/5\n\nCross multiply: 5*(10 -x) = 2*(19 -x)\n\n50 -5x =38 -2x\n\n50-38 =5x -2x \u2192 12=3x \u2192 x=4. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo x is 4 months. So C joined 4 months after B.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4 months. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mess up with the time calculations.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's compute the exact time each person has invested.\n\nA is in for 12 months.\n\nB is in for 10 months (since he joined after 2 months).\n\nC joined after B, so let's say after (2 + x) months, so his time is (12 - (2 +x)) =10 -x months.\n\nWait, but x is the number of months after B joined. So if B joined at month 2, and C joined at (2 + x), then C's time in the business is 12 - (2 + x) =10 -x.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the ratio is 40,000*12 :60,000*10 :120,000*(10 -x).\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n40k *12 = 480,000\n\n60k *10 =600,000\n\n120k*(10 -x) =120k*(10 -4)=120k *6=720,000.\n\nWait, if x=4, then 10 -x=6.\n\nSo the ratios are 480k :600k :720k.\n\nDivide all by 100,000: 4.8 :6 :7.2.\n\nWait, but that's not the same as the previous ratio. Wait, wait, let me think. Wait, when I simplified earlier, I divided by 12, but maybe I should have approached it differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the actual contributions.\n\nA's contribution: 40,000 for 12 months \u2192 40,000 *12 =480,000.\n\nB's contribution:60,000 *10 =600,000.\n\nC's contribution:120,000 * (10 -x) =120,000*(6) =720,000.\n\nSo the total contribution is 480,000 +600,000 +720,000 =1,800,000.\n\nThe total profit is 375,000.\n\nSo each part of the ratio is 375,000 /1,800,000 = (375/1800)= 25/120 =5/24.\n\nWait, no. Wait, each part is 375,000 divided by the sum of the ratios. Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum of the ratios as (480,000 +600,000 +720,000)=1,800,000.\n\nSo each unit of the ratio corresponds to 375,000 /1,800,000.\n\nWait, 375,000 /1,800,000 = (375/1800)= 5/24? Let me compute: 375/1800 = (375 \u00f7 75)/(1800 \u00f775)=5/24. Yes.\n\nSo each part is 5/24 of the total profit.\n\nSo C's share is (720,000 /1,800,000) *375,000.\n\nWait, 720,000 is C's contribution, so 720,000 /1,800,000 = 0.4 \u2192 40% of total.\n\nSo 40% of 375,000 is 150,000, which matches the given data. So yes, this makes sense.\n\nSo the calculations are correct, x=4. So C joined 4 months after B.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4 months. So the answer is B.\n",

Let me read it again carefully.\n\nSo, A starts a business with Rs.40,000. Two months later, B joins with Rs.60,000. Then, C joins them after some more time with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. I need to find out how many months after B joined did C join the business.\n\nHmm, okay. So this is a problem about profit sharing in a business based on the time each person has invested and the capital they've contributed.

Because the problem says \"at the end of the year.\" So A's time is 12 months.\n\nB joined after 2 months. So B's investment is there for the remaining months of the year. Wait, how many months is that? If A started and B joined after 2 months, then from the start of the year, B is in for 10 months (since 12-2=10). So B's time is 10 months.\n\nC joined after some more time after B. Let's denote the number of months after B joined that C joined as x. So, from the start, C joined at 2 + x months. But wait, how much time did C have in the business? Since the year ends after 12 months, C's time is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months.\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that. If B joined after 2 months, and C joined after some time after B. So the time between B joining and C joining is x months. So C's time in the business would be (12 - (2 + x)) months. Because from the start, B is at month 2, C is at month 2 + x. So the time C is in is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months.\n\nWait, but if C joined x months after B, then from the start, C's time is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months. So yes.\n\nSo each person's investment is multiplied by their time.

A is in for 12 months, correct. B is in for 10 months. C is in for (12 - (2 + x)) = 10 - x months. So yes.\n\nSo the ratio of their contributions is:\n\nA : B : C = (40,000 *12) : (60,000 *10) : (120,000 *(10 -x))\n\nWe can simplify this ratio by dividing each term by 10,000 to make it easier.\n\nSo,\n\nA : B : C = (4*12) : (6*10) : (12*(10 -x))\nWhich is 48 : 60 : 12*(10 -x)\n\nSimplify further by dividing each term by 12:\n\nA : B : C = 4 : 5 : (10 -x)\n\nWait, 48 /12 =4, 60/12=5, 12*(10-x)/12 = (10 -x). So yes.\n\nNow, the total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. So we can find out the proportion of C's share in the total profit.\n\nThe total profit is divided according to the ratio. So the sum of the ratios is 4 +5 + (10 -x) = 19 -x.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me compute the sum correctly.\n\nWait, 4 +5 + (10 -x) = 4 +5 is 9, plus 10 is 19, minus x. So sum is 19 -x.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the sum is 4 +5 + (10 -x) = 4+5=9, plus 10 is 19, minus x.

I need to find out how many months after B joined did C join the business.\n\nHmm, right. This is a partnership problem where each partner contributes capital for a certain period, and their profits are divided based on their capital multiplied by the time they've invested. So, the profit sharing ratio is directly proportional to the product of the capital and the time each partner has been in the business.\n\nLet me outline the periods each person was involved:\n\n- A is in the business for the entire year. Since the year is 12 months, and A started first, he's there for 12 months.\n\n- B joins after 2 months. So, B's time in the business is 12 - 2 = 10 months.\n\n- C joins some time after B. Let me denote the time after B joined as 'x' months. So, C's time in the business is x months.\n\nWait, wait. But the total time for the business is a year, right? So, let's think about the timeline.\n\nA starts in month 0. B joins at month 2. C joins at month (2 + x). The total time until the end of the year (12 months) is when the profit is calculated.\n\nSo, how many months was C in the business? It's 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months. Wait, that can't be right. Because if C joins after x months after B, and B joined at 2 months, then C joined at 2 + x months. The time until the end is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months. But wait, that would mean that x can't be more than 10, because otherwise, C would be joining after the business ends, which doesn't make sense. So x is less than 10. But wait, the options given include 24 months, which is more than 10. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that. The business runs for a year, 12 months. A starts at month 0. B joins at month 2. C joins after x months from B's joining, which is month 2 + x. So, the time C is in the business is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months. So, the time each person is in the business is:\n\nA: 12 months\nB: 10 months (since he joined at month 2)\nC: 10 - x months.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because if x is 8, then C is in for 2 months, which would make sense if x is 8. But looking at the options, option A is 2 months, which would make C's time 10 - 2 = 8 months. But the options for x are the months after B joined, so if x is 2, C joined 2 months after B, so at month 4.\n\nWait, maybe I should model this with their time in the business and their capital to find the profit ratio.\n\nThe profit is divided based on their capital multiplied by the time. So the ratio is (Capital * Time) for each partner.\n\nLet me denote the time C was in the business as Tc, which is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. If C joined x months after B, then the time C is in the business is (12 - (2 + x)) = 10 - x months. But wait, that would mean if x is 8, then 10 -8=2 months. So, for example, if C joined 8 months after B, that would be at month 2 + 8 =10, and the business ends at month 12, so C is in for 2 months. That makes sense.\n\nBut let's get back to the problem.\n\nThe total profit is 375,000, and C gets 150,000. So, C's share is (120,000 * Tc) / Total investment-time, multiplied by total profit.\n\nWait, actually, the profit is divided proportionally to their capital multiplied by time. So the ratio of their shares is (A's capital * A's time) : (B's capital * B's time) : (C's capital * C's time).\n\nSo, the ratio is (40000 * 12) : (60000 * 10) : (120000 * (10 - x)).\n\nWait, let me confirm. Because A is in for 12 months, B for 10 months, and C for (10 - x) months. So their ratios are:\n\nA: 40000 * 12 = 480000\nB: 60000 * 10 = 600000\nC: 120000 * (10 - x) = 1200000 - 120000x\n\nNow, the total profit is 375000, and C's share is 150000. So, C's ratio compared to the total ratio equals 150000 / 375000 = 1/2.5, which is 0.4.\n\nSo, the ratio of C's share to the total is (120000*(10 -x)) / [ (40000*12) + (60000*10) + (120000*(10 -x)) ] = 150000 / 375000.\n\nSimplify:\n\n120000*(10 -x) / [480000 + 600000 + 120000*(10 -x)] = 1/2.5\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n480000 + 600000 = 1,080,000.\n\nSo, denominator is 1,080,000 + 120000*(10 -x).\n\nSo,\n\n120000*(10 -x) / (1,080,000 + 120000*(10 -x)) ) = 1/2.5.\n\nLet me compute 1/2.5. 1/2.5 is 0.4, which is 2/5.\n\nSo,\n\n[120000*(10 -x)] / [1,080,000 + 120000*(10 -x)] = 2/5.\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n5 * 120000*(10 -x) = 2 * [1,080,000 + 120000*(10 -x)]\n\nCalculate both sides.\n\nLeft side: 5 * 120000*(10 -x) = 600000*(10 -x) = 6,000,000 - 600,000x.\n\nRight side: 2 * [1,080,000 + 120000*(10 -x)].\n\nLet me compute the term inside the brackets first:\n\n1,080,000 + 120000*(10 -x) = 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 - 120000x = 2,280,000 - 120000x.\n\nMultiply by 2: 4,560,000 - 240,000x.\n\nSo, now the equation is:\n\n6,000,000 - 600,000x = 4,560,000 - 240,000x.\n\nLet me bring all terms to the left side.\n\n6,000,000 - 600,000x -4,560,000 + 240,000x = 0.\n\nCompute 6,000,000 -4,560,000 = 1,440,000.\n\nCompute (-600,000x +240,000x) = -360,000x.\n\nSo, 1,440,000 - 360,000x = 0.\n\n1,440,000 = 360,000x.\n\nDivide both sides by 360,000:\n\nx = 1,440,000 / 360,000 = 4.\n\nSo x is 4 months. That means C joined 4 months after B joined. Since B joined after 2 months, C joined at 2 +4=6 months from the start, and was in the business for 12 -6=6 months. Wait, wait, no. Let me recheck. Because C joined x months after B, so if x=4, C joined 4 months after B. B joined at 2 months, so C joined at 2+4=6 months. So C was in the business for 12-6=6 months. Let's see if that makes sense.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought C's time was 10 -x months, but that was when I thought x was the time after B joined. Let me re-examine the earlier steps.\n\nWait, when I set up C's time as 10 -x, that was based on the idea that B was in for 10 months, and C joined x months after B, so C was in for 10 -x months. But that might be incorrect because the total time is 12 months.\n\nWait, let's model it again. A is in for 12 months. B joins at month 2, so B is in for 10 months. C joins x months after B, which is at month 2 +x. So, the time C is in is 12 - (2 +x) = 10 -x months.\n\nWait, so when x=4, C is in for 10-4=6 months. Which is correct because C joined at month 6, and the business ends at 12, so 6 months.\n\nSo, putting this back, x is 4 months, which is option B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nSo, the ratio:\n\nA: 40000 * 12 = 480,000\n\nB: 60000 * 10 = 600,000\n\nC: 120000 * (10 - x) = 120000*(6) = 720,000 when x=4.\n\nSo the total is 480k + 600k +720k = 1,800,000.\n\nC's share is 720,000 / 1,800,000 = 0.4, which is 40%. So 375,000 * 0.4 = 150,000. Which matches the given data.\n\nSo yes, x is 4 months. So the answer is option B)4 months.\n",

Because A is in for 12 months, B for 10 months, and C for (10 - x) months. So their ratios are:\n\nA: 40000 * 12 = 480000\nB: 60000 * 10 = 600000\nC: 120000 * (10 - x) = 1200000 - 120000x\n\nNow, the total profit is 375000, and C's share is 150000. So, C's ratio compared to the total ratio equals 150000 / 375000 = 1/2.5, which is 0.4.\n\nSo, the ratio of C's share to the total is (120000*(10 -x)) / [ (40000*12) + (60000*10) + (120000*(10 -x)) ] = 150000 / 375000.\n\nSimplify:\n\n120000*(10 -x) / [480000 + 600000 + 120000*(10 -x)] = 1/2.5\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n480000 + 600000 = 1,080,000.\n\nSo, denominator is 1,080,000 + 120000*(10 -x).\n\nSo,\n\n120000*(10 -x) / (1,080,000 + 120000*(10 -x)) ) = 1/2.5.\n\nLet me compute 1/2.5. 1/2.5 is 0.4, which is 2/5.\n\nSo,\n\n[120000*(10 -x)] / [1,080,000 + 120000*(10 -x)] = 2/5.\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n5 * 120000*(10 -x) = 2 * [1,080,000 + 120000*(10 -x)]\n\nCalculate both sides.\n\nLeft side: 5 * 120000*(10 -x) = 600000*(10 -x) = 6,000,000 - 600,000x.\n\nRight side: 2 * [1,080,000 + 120000*(10 -x)].\n\nLet me compute the term inside the brackets first:\n\n1,080,000 + 120000*(10 -x) = 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 - 120000x = 2,280,000 - 120000x.\n\nMultiply by 2: 4,560,000 - 240,000x.\n\nSo, now the equation is:\n\n6,000,000 - 600,000x = 4,560,000 - 240,000x.\n\nLet me bring all terms to the left side.\n\n6,000,000 - 600,000x -4,560,000 + 240,000x = 0.\n\nCompute 6,000,000 -4,560,000 = 1,440,000.\n\nCompute (-600,000x +240,000x) = -360,000x.\n\nSo, 1,440,000 - 360,000x = 0.\n\n1,440,000 = 360,000x.\n\nDivide both sides by 360,000:\n\nx = 1,440,000 / 360,000 = 4.\n\nSo x is 4 months. That means C joined 4 months after B joined. Since B joined after 2 months, C joined at 2 +4=6 months from the start, and was in the business for 12 -6=6 months. Wait, wait, no. Let me recheck. Because C joined x months after B, so if x=4, C joined 4 months after B. B joined at 2 months, so C joined at 2+4=6 months. So C was in the business for 12-6=6 months. Let's see if that makes sense.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought C's time was 10 -x months, but that was when I thought x was the time after B joined. Let me re-examine the earlier steps.\n\nWait, when I set up C's time as 10 -x, that was based on the idea that B was in for 10 months, and C joined x months after B, so C was in for 10 -x months. But that might be incorrect because the total time is 12 months.\n\nWait, let's model it again. A is in for 12 months. B joins at month 2, so B is in for 10 months. C joins x months after B, which is at month 2 +x. So, the time C is in is 12 - (2 +x) = 10 -x months.\n\nWait, so when x=4, C is in for 10-4=6 months. Which is correct because C joined at month 6, and the business ends at 12, so 6 months.\n\nSo, putting this back, x is 4 months, which is option B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nSo, the ratio:\n\nA: 40000 * 12 = 480,000\n\nB: 60000 * 10 = 600,000\n\nC: 120000 * (10 - x) = 120000*(6) = 720,000 when x=4.\n\nSo the total is 480k + 600k +720k = 1,800,000.\n\nC's share is 720,000 / 1,800,000 = 0.4, which is 40%. So 375,000 * 0.4 = 150,000. Which matches the given data.\n\nSo yes, x is 4 months.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about three people starting a business and figuring out when the third person joined. Hmm, let's try to break this down. \n\nAlright, the problem says A starts with Rs.40,000. Then after 2 months, B joins with Rs.60,000. Then C comes in some time later with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000. I need to find out how many months after B joined did C join. So the options are given, and I have to choose between them.\n\nWait, let me think about how partnerships work. Profit is usually divided based on the capital invested and the time for which it's invested. So each partner's share is (capital \u00d7 time) divided by the total time. So the profit ratio is based on their investments multiplied by the time each was invested.\n\nSo, let's denote the time each person's money was in the business. The total time is a year, which is 12 months.\n\nA started first. He invested Rs.40,000. So his investment was for 12 months. Because he started at the beginning.\n\nB joined after 2 months. So B's investment was for 12 - 2 = 10 months. Because he started in the third month and the business ended after 12 months.\n\nC joined some time after B. Let me call the number of months after B joined when C joined as x. So C joined 2 + x months after A started. Because A started at month 0, B at month 2, and C at month 2 + x. So the time C's money was in the business would be 12 - (2 + x) months. Wait, no. Wait, the business runs for a year, so from when C joins until the end is 12 - (2 + x) months? Wait, no, wait. Let's see: if C joins after x months since B joined, then the total time since A started is 2 + x. So the time C was in is 12 - (2 + x) months? Because 12 is the total time. So C's time is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months. Hmm, but that can't be right if x is more than 10. But let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should model the time each person's investment was active.\n\nWait, A is in for the entire 12 months. B is in for 10 months (since he started after 2 months). C is in for (12 - t) months, where t is the time he started after A. But t = 2 + x, where x is the time after B. So C is in for 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months.\n\nWait, but if x is the number of months after B joined, then t = 2 + x, so C's time is 12 - t = 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x. So C's time is (10 - x) months. Hmm.\n\nWait, but if x is the time after B joined, then the time from when C joined to the end is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x. So yes, C is in for (10 - x) months.\n\nWait, but if x is the time after B joined, then for example, if x is 0, C joins right when B does, so C's time would be 10 months. If x is 1, C joins one month after B, so C's time is 9 months, etc.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Let me make a timeline.\n\n- Month 0: A starts with Rs40k.\n- Month 2: B joins with Rs60k.\n- Month 2 + x: C joins with Rs120k.\n\nSo the time each person's investment is in the business is:\n\n- A: from month 0 to 12 \u2192 12 months.\n- B: from month 2 to 12 \u2192 10 months.\n- C: from month (2 + x) to 12 \u2192 (12 - (2 + x)) = 10 - x months.\n\nWait, but 10 - x must be positive, so x must be less than 10. Because if x were 10, then C would join at month 12, which is the end, so he wouldn't have any time in the business. So x must be less than 10. So the maximum x is 9, but let's see.\n\nNow, the profit is divided based on each person's capital multiplied by the time they were in. So their profit shares are proportional to (capital \u00d7 time).\n\nTotal profit is 375,000, and C gets 150,000. So C's share is 150,000, which is 150,000 / 375,000 = 1/2.5, or 40% of the total profit.\n\nWait, 150k is 1/2.5 of 375k? Let me calculate: 375,000 * (1/2.5) = 150,000. So yes, C's share is 40% of the profit.\n\nSo the profit ratio is A:B:C = (40000 \u00d7 12) : (60000 \u00d7 10) : (120000 \u00d7 (10 - x)).\n\nWait, wait. Let me compute each person's capital \u00d7 time.\n\nA: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000.\n\nB:60,000 * 10 = 600,000.\n\nC:120,000 * (10 - x) = 120,000*(10 -x).\n\nSo the total profit ratio is (480,000) : (600,000) : (120,000*(10 - x)).\n\nBut the actual profit shares are based on their ratios. So the sum of these three is the total profit.\n\nWait, but the total profit is 375,000. Hmm, but the way the profit is divided is according to their individual (capital \u00d7 time), so the sum of all parts should equal the total profit.\n\nWait, wait. Wait a minute, no. The total profit is 375,000. The profit is divided in the ratio of their individual (capital \u00d7 time). So C's share is 150,000. So, the ratio of C's share to the total is 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4, which is 40%. So the ratio of C's part to the total is 40%.\n\nSo, let's compute the ratio of each person's (capital \u00d7 time) to the total (sum of all three parts).\n\nC's part is 120,000*(10 - x) = 120000*(10 - x). The total sum would be 480000 + 600000 + 120000*(10 - x) = 1,080,000 + 1,200,000*(10 -x) \u2192 Wait no. Let's compute it correctly.\n\nWait, 480,000 (A) + 600,000 (B) + 120,000*(10 -x) (C). \n\nSo total = 480,000 + 600,000 + 1,200,000*(10 - x) \u2192 Wait no, 120,000 * (10 - x) = 1,200,000*(10 -x)/10. No, wait, 120,000*(10 -x) is just 1,200,000*(10 -x)/10? Hmm, no, that's not right. Wait, 120,000 is 1.2e5, so 1.2e5*(10-x) = 1,200,000*(10 -x)/10? No, wait, no, 120,000 * (10 - x) is simply 1,200,000*(10 -x)/10? Wait, no, 120,000 is 12*10,000. So 120,000*(10 -x) = 1,200,000 - 120,000x. \n\nSo the total sum is 480,000 + 600,000 + 1,200,000 -120,000x \u2192 480,000 + 600,000 is 1,080,000. Plus 1,200,000 is 2,280,000. Minus 120,000x. So total is 2,280,000 -120,000x.\n\nBut the total profit is 375,000. Hmm, wait, but that can't be right because 2,280,000 is way more than 375,000. So I think I'm getting this wrong. Oh wait, no. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the ratio with the actual profit. Because the ratio of their (capital \u00d7 time) determines how the profit is split, but the sum of the ratios equals the total profit.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The profit is divided in proportion to their (capital \u00d7 time). So if A has (40,000 \u00d7 12), B has (60,000 \u00d710), and C has (120,000 \u00d7 (10 -x)), then the profit share of each is (their product) / (sum of all products) \u00d7 total profit.\n\nSo C's share is [120,000 \u00d7 (10 -x)] / [480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000(10 -x)] \u00d7 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nSo let's set up the equation:\n\n(120,000 \u00d7 (10 - x)) / [480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000 (10 - x)] \u00d7 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nLet me compute the denominator first. 480,000 + 600,000 is 1,080,000. Plus 120,000*(10 -x) is 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 -120,000x. So denominator is 2,280,000 -120,000x.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n[120,000*(10 -x) / (2,280,000 -120,000x)] \u00d7 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nLet me simplify this.\n\nFirst, divide both sides by 375,000:\n\n[120,000*(10 -x) / (2,280,000 -120,000x)] = 150,000 / 375,000.\n\n150,000 / 375,000 is 0.4.\n\nSo:\n\n[120,000*(10 -x)] / (2,280,000 -120,000x) ) = 0.4.\n\nLet me multiply both sides by denominator:\n\n120,000*(10 -x) = 0.4*(2,280,000 -120,000x).\n\nCompute RHS: 0.4 * 2,280,000 is 912,000. 0.4 * (-120,000x) is -48,000x.\n\nSo:\n\n120,000*(10 -x) = 912,000 -48,000x.\n\nExpand left side: 1,200,000 -120,000x.\n\nSo:\n\n1,200,000 -120,000x = 912,000 -48,000x.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n1,200,000 -912,000 = 120,000x -48,000x.\n\n288,000 = 72,000x.\n\nDivide both sides by 72,000:\n\n288,000 /72,000 = x.\n\n288,000 \u00f7 72,000 = 4.\n\nSo x =4.\n\nWait, so x is 4 months. That means C joined 4 months after B joined.\n\nWait, so the question is how many months after B joined did C join? So the answer is 4 months, which is option B.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations.\n\nSo, A's investment time: 12, B's:10, C's:10 -4=6 months.\n\nSo their (capital \u00d7 time):\n\nA:40,000 \u00d712 =480,000.\n\nB:60,000 \u00d710=600,000.\n\nC:120,000 \u00d76=720,000.\n\nTotal:480,000 +600,000=1,080,000 +720,000=1,800,000.\n\nWait, but earlier I had the denominator as 2,280,000 -120,000x. With x=4, denominator becomes 2,280,000 - 480,000 = 1,800,000. Which matches.\n\nSo C's share is 720,000 / 1,800,000 = 0.4, which is 40% of 375,000 \u2192 0.4 *375,000=150,000. Which matches the given data.\n\nSo yes, x=4 months. So the answer is option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about three people starting a business and figuring out when the third person joined. Hmm, let's try to break this down. \n\nAlright, the problem says A starts with Rs.40,000. Then after 2 months, B joins with Rs.60,000. Then C comes in some time later with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000. I need to find out how many months after B joined did C join. So the options are given, and I have to choose between them.\n\nWait, let me think about how partnerships work. Profit is usually divided based on the capital invested and the time for which it's invested. So each partner's share is (capital \u00d7 time) divided by the total time. So the profit ratio is based on their investments multiplied by the time each was invested.\n\nSo, let's denote the time each person's money was in the business. The total time is a year, which is 12 months.\n\nA started first. He invested Rs.40,000. So his investment was for 12 months. Because he started at the beginning.\n\nB joined after 2 months. So B's investment was for 12 - 2 = 10 months. Because he started in the third month and the business ended after 12 months.\n\nC joined some time after B. Let me call the number of months after B joined when C joined as x. So C joined 2 + x months after A started. Because A started at month 0, B at month 2, and C at month 2 + x. So the time C's money was in the business would be 12 - (2 + x) months. Wait, no. Wait, the business runs for a year, so from when C joins until the end is 12 - (2 + x) months? Wait, no, wait. Let's see: if C joins after x months since B joined, then the total time since A started is 2 + x. So the time C was in is 12 - (2 + x) months? Because 12 is the total time. So C's time is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months. Hmm, but that can't be right if x is more than 10. But let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should model the time each person's investment was active.\n\nWait, A is in for the entire 12 months. B is in for 10 months (since he started after 2 months). C is in for (12 - t) months, where t is the time he started after A. But t = 2 + x, where x is the time after B. So C is in for 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months.\n\nWait, but if x is the number of months after B joined, then t = 2 + x, so C's time is 12 - t = 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x. So C's time is (10 - x) months. Hmm.\n\nWait, but if x is the time after B joined, then the time from when C joined to the end is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x. So yes, C is in for (10 - x) months.\n\nWait, but if x is the time after B joined, then for example, if x is 0, C joins right when B does, so C's time would be 10 months. If x is 1, C joins one month after B, so C's time is 9 months, etc.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Let me make a timeline.\n\n- Month 0: A starts with Rs40k.\n- Month 2: B joins with Rs60k.\n- Month 2 + x: C joins with Rs120k.\n\nSo the time each person's investment is in the business is:\n\n- A: from month 0 to 12 \u2192 12 months.\n- B: from month 2 to 12 \u2192 10 months.\n- C: from month (2 + x) to 12 \u2192 (12 - (2 + x)) = 10 - x months.\n\nWait, but 10 - x must be positive, so x must be less than 10. Because if x were 10, then C would join at month 12, which is the end, so he wouldn't have any time in the business. So x must be less than 10. So the maximum x is 9, but let's see.\n\nNow, the profit is divided based on each person's capital multiplied by the time they were in. So their profit shares are proportional to (capital \u00d7 time).\n\nTotal profit is 375,000, and C gets 150,000. So C's share is 150,000, which is 150,000 / 375,000 = 1/2.5, or 40% of the total profit.\n\nWait, 150k is 1/2.5 of 375k? Let me calculate: 375,000 * (1/2.5) = 150,000. So yes, C's share is 40% of the profit.\n\nSo the profit ratio is A:B:C = (40000 \u00d7 12) : (60000 \u00d7 10) : (120000 \u00d7 (10 - x)).\n\nWait, wait. Let me compute each person's capital \u00d7 time.\n\nA: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000.\n\nB:60,000 * 10 = 600,000.\n\nC:120,000 * (10 - x) = 120,000*(10 -x).\n\nSo the total profit ratio is (480,000) : (600,000) : (120,000*(10 - x)).\n\nBut the actual profit shares are based on their ratios. So the sum of these three is the total profit.\n\nWait, but the total profit is 375,000. Hmm, but the way the profit is divided is according to their individual (capital \u00d7 time), so the sum of all parts should equal the total profit.\n\nWait, wait. Wait a minute, no. The total profit is 375,000. The profit is divided in the ratio of their individual (capital \u00d7 time). So C's share is 150,000. So, the ratio of C's share to the total is 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4, which is 40%. So the ratio of C's part to the total is 40%.\n\nSo, let's compute the ratio of each person's (capital \u00d7 time) to the total (sum of all three parts).\n\nC's part is 120,000*(10 - x) = 120000*(10 - x). The total sum would be 480000 + 600000 + 120000*(10 - x) = 1,080,000 + 1,200,000*(10 -x) \u2192 Wait no. Let's compute it correctly.\n\nWait, 480,000 (A) + 600,000 (B) + 120,000*(10 -x) (C). \n\nSo total = 480,000 + 600,000 + 1,200,000*(10 - x) \u2192 Wait no, 120,000 * (10 - x) = 1,200,000*(10 -x)/10. No, wait, 120,000*(10 -x) is just 1,200,000*(10 -x)/10? Hmm, no, that's not right. Wait, 120,000 is 1.2e5, so 1.2e5*(10-x) = 1,200,000*(10 -x)/10? No, wait, no, 120,000 * (10 - x) is simply 1,200,000*(10 -x)/10? Wait, no, 120,000 is 12*10,000. So 120,000*(10 -x) = 1,200,000 - 120,000x. \n\nSo the total sum is 480,000 + 600,000 + 1,200,000 -120,000x \u2192 480,000 + 600,000 is 1,080,000. Plus 1,200,000 is 2,280,000. Minus 120,000x. So total is 2,280,000 -120,000x.\n\nBut the total profit is 375,000. Hmm, wait, but that can't be right because 2,280,000 is way more than 375,000. So I think I'm getting this wrong. Oh wait, no. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the ratio with the actual profit. Because the ratio of their (capital \u00d7 time) determines how the profit is split, but the sum of the ratios equals the total profit.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The profit is divided in proportion to their (capital \u00d7 time). So if A has (40,000 \u00d7 12), B has (60,000 \u00d710), and C has (120,000 \u00d7 (10 -x)), then the profit share of each is (their product) / (sum of all products) \u00d7 total profit.\n\nSo C's share is [120,000 \u00d7 (10 -x)] / [480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000(10 -x)] \u00d7 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nSo let's set up the equation:\n\n(120,000 \u00d7 (10 - x)) / [480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000 (10 - x)] \u00d7 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nLet me compute the denominator first. 480,000 + 600,000 is 1,080,000. Plus 120,000*(10 -x) is 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 -120,000x. So denominator is 2,280,000 -120,000x.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n[120,000*(10 -x) / (2,280,000 -120,000x)] \u00d7 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nLet me simplify this.\n\nFirst, divide both sides by 375,000:\n\n[120,000*(10 -x) / (2,280,000 -120,000x)] = 150,000 / 375,000.\n\n150,000 / 375,000 is 0.4.\n\nSo:\n\n[120,000*(10 -x)] / (2,280,000 -120,000x) ) = 0.4.\n\nLet me multiply both sides by denominator:\n\n120,000*(10 -x) = 0.4*(2,280,000 -120,000x).\n\nCompute RHS: 0.4 * 2,280,000 is 912,000. 0.4 * (-120,000x) is -48,000x.\n\nSo:\n\n120,000*(10 -x) = 912,000 -48,000x.\n\nExpand left side: 1,200,000 -120,000x.\n\nSo:\n\n1,200,000 -120,000x = 912,000 -48,000x.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n1,200,000 -912,000 = 120,000x -48,000x.\n\n288,000 = 72,000x.\n\nDivide both sides by 72,000:\n\n288,000 /72,000 = x.\n\n288,000 \u00f7 72,000 = 4.\n\nSo x =4.\n\nWait, so x is 4 months. That means C joined 4 months after B joined.\n\nWait, so the question is how many months after B joined did C join? So the answer is 4 months, which is option B.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations.\n\nSo, A's investment time: 12, B's:10, C's:10 -4=6 months.\n\nSo their (capital \u00d7 time):\n\nA:40,000 \u00d712 =480,000.\n\nB:60,000 \u00d710=600,000.\n\nC:120,000 \u00d76=720,000.\n\nTotal:480,000 +600,000=1,080,000 +720,000=1,800,000.\n\nWait, but earlier I had the denominator as 2,280,000 -120,000x. With x=4, denominator becomes 2,280,000 - 480,000 = 1,800,000. Which matches.\n\nSo C's share is 720,000 / 1,800,000 = 0.4, which is 40% of 375,000 \u2192 0.4 *375,000=150,000. Which matches the given data.\n\nSo yes, x=4 months. So the answer is option B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the business partnership based on the capital invested and the time each partner's investment was active. The profit is divided proportionally to the product of capital and time for each partner.\n\n### Key Information:\n1. **A's Investment**: Rs. 40,000 for 12 months (since A started the business at the beginning).\n2. **B's Investment**: Rs. 60,000 for 10 months (B joined after 2 months, so the business ran for 12 - 2 = 10 months).\n3. **C's Investment**: Rs. 120,000 for \\(10 - x\\) months, where \\(x\\) is the number of months after B joined when C joined.\n4. **Total Profit**: Rs. 375,000.\n5. **C's Share**: Rs. 150,000, which is 40% of the total profit.\n\n### Profit Ratio:\nThe profit is divided based on the product of capital and time. The profit ratio for A, B, and C is:\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = (40,000 \\times 12) : (60,000 \\times 10) : (120,000 \\times (10 - x))\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = 480,000 : 600,000 : 1,200,000(10 - x)\n\\]\n\n### Total Profit and C's Share:\nThe total profit is Rs. 375,000, and C's share is Rs. 150,000. The fraction of the profit that C receives is:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{C's Share}}{\\text{Total Profit}} = \\frac{150,000}{375,000} = 0.4\n\\]\nThis means C's share of the profit ratio is 40% of the total profit ratio. Let the total profit ratio be:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Profit Ratio} = 480,000 + 600,000 + 1,200,000(10 - x)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total Profit Ratio} = 1,080,000 + 1,200,000(10 - x)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total Profit Ratio} = 2,280,000 - 120,000x\n\\]\n\nThe fraction of the profit ratio that C contributes is:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{C's Contribution}}{\\text{Total Profit Ratio}} = \\frac{1,200,000(10 - x)}{2,280,000 - 120,000x}\n\\]\nSince this fraction equals 0.4 (C's share of the profit):\n\\[\n\\frac{1,200,000(10 - x)}{2,280,000 - 120,000x} = 0.4\n\\]\n\n### Solving for \\(x\\):\nMultiply both sides by the denominator:\n\\[\n1,200,000(10 - x) = 0.4(2,280,000 - 120,000x)\n\\]\nExpand both sides:\n\\[\n1,200,000(10 - x) = 912,000 - 48,000x\n\\]\n\\[\n1,200,000 - 1,200,000x = 912,000 - 48,000x\n\\]\nRearrange terms:\n\\[\n1,200,000 - 912,000 = 1,200,000x - 48,000x\n\\]\n\\[\n288,000 = 1,152,000x\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{288,000}{1,152,000} = 4\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nC joined the business 4 months after B joined. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: B**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about three people starting a business and sharing profits. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on partnership problems, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nAlright, the setup is: A starts with Rs.40,000. After 2 months, B joins with Rs.60,000. Then, some time later, C joins with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000. We need to find out how many months after B joined did C join.\n\nWait, the question says \"after some more time\" so the order is A first, then B after 2 months, then C after some more time. The time each person has their investment in the business matters for profit sharing because it's based on capital multiplied by time.\n\nSo, let me try to structure this.\n\nFirst, the timeline:\n\n- A starts the business at month 0 with Rs.40,000.\n- B joins after 2 months (month 2) with Rs.60,000.\n- C joins some time after B. Let's say C joins after x months from when B joined. So from the start, that's 2 + x months.\n\nWait, but the business runs for a year, which is 12 months. So the total period is 12 months. So each person's investment is in the business for a certain number of months.\n\nA's investment is for the entire year, 12 months.\n\nB joined after 2 months, so B's investment is for (12 - 2) = 10 months.\n\nC joined at 2 + x months from the start, so C's investment is for (12 - (2 + x)) months. Because the business ends at 12 months. So C's time is (10 - x) months.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let's think again. The time each person's money is in the business is the period from when they joined until the end of the year.\n\nSo:\n\nA is there from month 0 to month 12: 12 months.\n\nB joins at month 2, so from month 2 to 12: that's 10 months.\n\nC joins at month (2 + x), so from (2 + x) to 12: that's (12 - (2 + x)) = (10 - x) months.\n\nBut wait, the problem says C joined \"after some more time\" after B. So x is the number of months after B joined that C came in. So from the start, C joined at 2 + x months. So his time is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months.\n\nSo each person's capital multiplied by their time in the business gives their contribution.\n\nThe profit is divided based on the ratio of these contributions. So the profit share ratio is (A's capital * A's time) : (B's * B's time) : (C's * C's time).\n\nGiven that, the total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nA's contribution: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000.\n\nB's contribution: 60,000 * 10 = 600,000.\n\nC's contribution: 120,000 * (10 - x) = 120,000*(10 - x).\n\nSo the ratio of their contributions is 480,000 : 600,000 : [120,000*(10 - x)].\n\nWe can simplify these numbers to make the ratios easier. Let's divide each by 1000 to make them smaller:\n\n480 : 600 : 120*(10 - x).\n\nSimplify further by dividing by 60: 8 : 10 : 2*(10 - x).\n\nWait, 480/60=8, 600/60=10, 120/60=2. So 8 : 10 : 2*(10 - x).\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to express the ratio as A:B:C = 40*12 : 60*10 : 120*(10 - x) \u2192 480 : 600 : 120*(10 - x).\n\nWe can factor this:\n\n480 = 16*30, 600=20*30, 120*(10 -x) = 4*30*(10 -x). So the ratio is 16:20:4*(10 -x).\n\nBut perhaps another approach is better. Since the profit is divided in the ratio of their contributions, the share of each person is (their contribution)/(total contributions) multiplied by total profit.\n\nSo C's share is (120,000*(10 - x)) / (480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(10 -x)) ) * 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nSo let's set up the equation:\n\n[120,000*(10 - x)] / [480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(10 -x)] * 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nHmm, let's compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, simplify the numerator and denominator.\n\nNumerator: 120,000*(10 - x).\n\nDenominator: 480,000 + 600,000 = 1,080,000. Plus 120,000*(10 - x) \u2192 1,080,000 + 120,000*(10 - x).\n\nSo the fraction becomes [120,000*(10 -x)] / [1,080,000 + 120,000*(10 -x)].\n\nLet me factor out 120,000 from the denominator:\n\nDenominator = 120,000*(9) + 120,000*(10 -x) \u2192 120,000 [9 + (10 -x)] = 120,000*(19 -x).\n\nWait, wait. 1,080,000 is 120,000 *9, because 120k *9=1,080k.\n\nSo denominator = 120,000 *9 + 120,000*(10 -x) = 120,000 [9 + (10 -x)] = 120,000*(19 -x).\n\nSo the fraction is [120,000*(10 -x)] / [120,000*(19 -x)] = (10 -x)/(19 -x).\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n(10 -x)/(19 -x) * 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n(10 -x)/(19 -x) = 150,000 / 375,000.\n\nSimplify 150,000 / 375,000 \u2192 150 / 375 = 2/5.\n\nSo (10 -x)/(19 -x) = 2/5.\n\nCross multiply:\n\n5*(10 -x) = 2*(19 -x).\n\nCompute each side:\n\n50 -5x = 38 -2x.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n50 -5x -38 +2x = 0 \u2192 12 -3x =0 \u2192 3x=12 \u2192 x=4.\n\nWait, so x is 4 months. So C joined 4 months after B. Since B joined after 2 months, C joined 2 + 4 = 6 months after the start. But the question asks how many months after B joined did C join. So x=4.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4 months. So the answer is B.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSo the equation after simplifying:\n\n(10 - x)/(19 -x) = 2/5.\n\nCross multiply: 5(10 -x) = 2(19 -x).\n\n50 -5x = 38 -2x.\n\n50-38 =5x -2x \u2192 12=3x \u2192 x=4. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer is 4 months after B joined, which is option B.\n",

Because the business ends at 12 months. So C's time is (10 - x) months.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let's think again. The time each person's money is in the business is the period from when they joined until the end of the year.\n\nSo:\n\nA is there from month 0 to month 12: 12 months.\n\nB joins at month 2, so from month 2 to 12: that's 10 months.\n\nC joins at month (2 + x), so from (2 + x) to 12: that's (12 - (2 + x)) = (10 - x) months.\n\nBut wait, the problem says C joined \"after some more time\" after B. So x is the number of months after B joined that C came in. So from the start, C joined at 2 + x months. So his time is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months.\n\nSo each person's capital multiplied by their time in the business gives their contribution.\n\nThe profit is divided based on the ratio of these contributions. So the profit share ratio is (A's capital * A's time) : (B's * B's time) : (C's * C's time).\n\nGiven that, the total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nA's contribution: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000.\n\nB's contribution: 60,000 * 10 = 600,000.\n\nC's contribution: 120,000 * (10 - x) = 120,000*(10 - x).\n\nSo the ratio of their contributions is 480,000 : 600,000 : [120,000*(10 - x)].\n\nWe can simplify these numbers to make the ratios easier.

So 8 : 10 : 2*(10 - x).\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to express the ratio as A:B:C = 40*12 : 60*10 : 120*(10 - x) \u2192 480 : 600 : 120*(10 - x).\n\nWe can factor this:\n\n480 = 16*30, 600=20*30, 120*(10 -x) = 4*30*(10 -x). So the ratio is 16:20:4*(10 -x).\n\nBut perhaps another approach is better. Since the profit is divided in the ratio of their contributions, the share of each person is (their contribution)/(total contributions) multiplied by total profit.\n\nSo C's share is (120,000*(10 - x)) / (480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(10 -x)) ) * 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nSo let's set up the equation:\n\n[120,000*(10 - x)] / [480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(10 -x)] * 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nHmm, let's compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, simplify the numerator and denominator.\n\nNumerator: 120,000*(10 - x).\n\nDenominator: 480,000 + 600,000 = 1,080,000. Plus 120,000*(10 - x) \u2192 1,080,000 + 120,000*(10 - x).\n\nSo the fraction becomes [120,000*(10 -x)] / [1,080,000 + 120,000*(10 -x)].\n\nLet me factor out 120,000 from the denominator:\n\nDenominator = 120,000*(9) + 120,000*(10 -x) \u2192 120,000 [9 + (10 -x)] = 120,000*(19 -x).\n\nWait, wait. 1,080,000 is 120,000 *9, because 120k *9=1,080k.\n\nSo denominator = 120,000 *9 + 120,000*(10 -x) = 120,000 [9 + (10 -x)] = 120,000*(19 -x).\n\nSo the fraction is [120,000*(10 -x)] / [120,000*(19 -x)] = (10 -x)/(19 -x).\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n(10 -x)/(19 -x) * 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n(10 -x)/(19 -x) = 150,000 / 375,000.\n\nSimplify 150,000 / 375,000 \u2192 150 / 375 = 2/5.\n\nSo (10 -x)/(19 -x) = 2/5.\n\nCross multiply:\n\n5*(10 -x) = 2*(19 -x).\n\nCompute each side:\n\n50 -5x = 38 -2x.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n50 -5x -38 +2x = 0 \u2192 12 -3x =0 \u2192 3x=12 \u2192 x=4.\n\nWait, so x is 4 months. So C joined 4 months after B. Since B joined after 2 months, C joined 2 + 4 = 6 months after the start. But the question asks how many months after B joined did C join. So x=4.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4 months. So the answer is B.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSo the equation after simplifying:\n\n(10 - x)/(19 -x) = 2/5.\n\nCross multiply: 5(10 -x) = 2(19 -x).\n\n50 -5x = 38 -2x.\n\n50-38 =5x -2x \u2192 12=3x \u2192 x=4. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer is 4 months after B joined, which is option B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the timeline and contributions of each partner:\n\n1. **Timeline and Contributions**:\n   - A starts the business with Rs.40,000 and stays for the entire year (12 months).\n   - B joins after 2 months with Rs.60,000 and stays for 10 months (from month 2 to 12).\n   - C joins after \\(x\\) months from when B joined (i.e., at month \\(2 + x\\)) and stays for \\(10 - x\\) months (from month \\(2 + x\\) to 12).\n\n2. **Profit Sharing Ratio**:\n   The profit is divided based on the ratio of each partner's contribution, which is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Contribution} = \\text{Capital} \\times \\text{Time}.\n   \\]\n   - A's contribution: \\(40,000 \\times 12 = 480,000\\).\n   - B's contribution: \\(60,000 \\times 10 = 600,000\\).\n   - C's contribution: \\(120,000 \\times (10 - x)\\).\n\n   The profit-sharing ratio is therefore:\n   \\[\n   480,000 : 600,000 : 120,000 \\times (10 - x).\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplifying the Ratio**:\n   Divide all terms by 1000 to simplify:\n   \\[\n   480 : 600 : 120 \\times (10 - x).\n   \\]\n   Further simplification by dividing by 60 gives:\n   \\[\n   8 : 10 : 2 \\times (10 - x).\n   \\]\n\n4. **Profit Distribution**:\n   The total profit is Rs.375,000, and C's share is Rs.150,000. Using the profit-sharing ratio:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{C's Contribution}}{\\text{Total Contribution}} \\times 375,000 = 150,000.\n   \\]\n   Substituting C's contribution:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{120,000 \\times (10 - x)}{480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000 \\times (10 - x)} \\times 375,000 = 150,000.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solving for \\(x\\)**:\n   Simplify the denominator:\n   \\[\n   480,000 + 600,000 = 1,080,000.\n   \\]\n   Denominator becomes:\n   \\[\n   1,080,000 + 120,000 \\times (10 - x) = 120,000 \\times (9 + 10 - x) = 120,000 \\times (19 - x).\n   \\]\n   The fraction simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{120,000 \\times (10 - x)}{120,000 \\times (19 - x)} = \\frac{10 - x}{19 - x}.\n   \\]\n   Substituting into the profit equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10 - x}{19 - x} \\times 375,000 = 150,000.\n   \\]\n   Divide both sides by 375,000:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10 - x}{19 - x} = \\frac{150,000}{375,000} = \\frac{2}{5}.\n   \\]\n   Cross-multiplying:\n   \\[\n   5(10 - x) = 2(19 - x).\n   \\]\n   Expanding:\n   \\[\n   50 - 5x = 38 - 2x.\n   \\]\n   Rearranging:\n   \\[\n   50 - 38 = 5x - 2x \\implies 12 = 3x \\implies x = 4.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   C joined 4 months after B. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: B**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this business partnership problem. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nSo, the setup is that A starts a business with Rs.40,000. Then, after 2 months, B joins him with Rs.60,000. Some time later, C joins with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. The question is asking how many months after B joined did C join the business.\n\nHmm. Right, so the key here is to figure out the time each person's investment was in the business because profit is divided based on the capital multiplied by the time each person was invested. So this is a problem about calculating profit shares based on the time and capital invested.\n\nLet me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the timeline:\n\n- A starts the business with Rs.40,000. So A's investment is for the entire year, right? Because he started at the beginning.\n\nWait, wait. The year is 12 months. So A is invested for 12 months.\n\nThen, B joins after 2 months. So B's investment is for (12 - 2) = 10 months? Wait no, because the total time is a year. So if B joins after 2 months, he's in for 10 months.\n\nWait, wait. Let's think. The business runs for a year. A starts at month 0. B joins at month 2, so B is in from month 2 to month 12, which is 10 months. Correct.\n\nThen, C joins after some more time after B. So C's joining time is after month 2 plus some months. Let's call the number of months after B joined as 'x' months. So C joins at month (2 + x), and since the business ends after 12 months, C's investment is for (12 - (2 + x)) = (10 - x) months. Wait, no. Because if C joins after x months after B, that's adding to B's 2 months. So the time C is in is (12 - (2 + x)) = 10 - x months. But wait, that can't be right because if x is 0, C would be in for 10 months. But if x is 8, then C would be in for 2 months. That makes sense.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Let me denote the time each person is in the business.\n\nA is in for 12 months.\n\nB is in for (12 - 2) = 10 months.\n\nC is in for (12 - (2 + x)) = 10 - x months.\n\nWait, but x is the number of months after B joined. So if x is 4, C joined 4 months after B, which is at month 6, and is in for 12 -6 =6 months.\n\nSo, the formula for profit sharing is based on the product of capital and time. So each person's share is proportional to (capital \u00d7 time).\n\nSo, total profit is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000.\n\nSo, C's share is (C's capital \u00d7 C's time) / (sum of all (capital \u00d7 time)) multiplied by total profit.\n\nLet me write that as:\n\nC's share = (120000 \u00d7 (10 - x)) / (40000\u00d712 + 60000\u00d710 + 120000\u00d7(10 -x)) ) \u00d7 375000 = 150000.\n\nHmm, okay. Let's set up the equation.\n\nFirst, compute each person's capital \u00d7 time.\n\nA: 40,000 \u00d7 12 = 480,000\n\nB: 60,000 \u00d7 10 = 600,000\n\nC: 120,000 \u00d7 (10 - x) = 120,000*(10 -x)\n\nSo the total capital \u00d7 time is 480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(10 - x) = 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000x = 2,280,000 - 120,000x.\n\nWait, wait. Let me compute that again:\n\n40,000 *12 = 480,000.\n\n60,000 *10 = 600,000.\n\n120,000 * (10 - x) = 1,200,000 -120,000x.\n\nAdding all together: 480,000 + 600,000 = 1,080,000. Then plus 1,200,000 gives 2,280,000. Minus 120,000 x. So total is 2,280,000 - 120,000 x.\n\nNow, C's share is (120,000*(10 -x )) / (2,280,000 -120,000x) ) * 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nSo, let's write that equation.\n\n(120,000*(10 -x )) / (2,280,000 -120,000x) ) * 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nLet me simplify this.\n\nFirst, let me divide both sides by 375,000.\n\n(120,000*(10 -x )) / (2,280,000 -120,000x) ) = 150,000 / 375,000.\n\n150,000 / 375,000 is 0.4.\n\nSo,\n\n(120,000*(10 -x )) / (2,280,000 -120,000x) ) = 0.4.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n(120,000*(10 - x)) = 0.4 * (2,280,000 -120,000 x).\n\nCompute the right side:\n\n0.4 * 2,280,000 = 912,000.\n\n0.4 * (-120,000 x) = -48,000 x.\n\nSo,\n\n120,000*(10 -x) = 912,000 -48,000x.\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\n120,000 *10 = 1,200,000.\n\n120,000*(-x) = -120,000 x.\n\nSo,\n\n1,200,000 -120,000 x = 912,000 -48,000 x.\n\nNow, bring all terms to one side.\n\nLet's subtract 912,000 from both sides:\n\n1,200,000 -912,000 -120,000 x +48,000 x = 0.\n\nCompute 1,200,000 -912,000 = 288,000.\n\n-120,000x +48,000x = (-72,000)x.\n\nSo,\n\n288,000 -72,000 x = 0.\n\nBring 72,000x to the other side:\n\n288,000 =72,000 x.\n\nDivide both sides by 72,000:\n\nx = 288,000 /72,000 = 4.\n\nSo x is 4 months.\n\nWait, but x is the number of months after B joined. So C joined 4 months after B.\n\nSo the correct answer is 4 months, which is option B.\n",

Let the total capital-time be:\n\\[\n\\text{Total} = (40,000 \\times 12) + (60,000 \\times 10) + (120,000 \\times (10 - x)).\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total} = 480,000 + 600,000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000x = 2,280,000 - 120,000x.\n\\]\n\nC's share is:\n\\[\n\\frac{120,000 \\times (10 - x)}{2,280,000 - 120,000x} \\times 375,000 = 150,000.\n\\]\n\n### Solving for \\(x\\):\nSimplify the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{120,000 \\times (10 - x)}{2,280,000 - 120,000x} = 0.4.\n\\]\n\\[\n120,000 \\times (10 - x) = 0.4 \\times (2,280,000 - 120,000x).\n\\]\n\\[\n1,200,000 - 120,000x = 912,000 - 48,000x.\n\\]\n\\[\n288,000 = 72,000x.\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{288,000}{72,000} = 4.\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(x = 4\\), meaning C joined the business **4 months after B**.\n\n### Final Answer:\nC joined the business **4 months after B joined**.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this business problem here. Let me read it again and try to figure it out step by step.\n\nA starts a business with Rs.40,000. Then after 2 months, B joins with Rs.60,000. Then, some time later, C joins with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000. I need to find out how many months after B joined did C join.\n\nHmm, right. So this is a partnership problem where each partner contributes capital for a certain period. The profit is divided based on their capital multiplied by the time they've been in the business, right?\n\nLet me break it down. The time each person is in the business matters because profit is calculated on the basis of their investment and the duration they've invested for.\n\nA starts first. He invests Rs.40,000. Let's assume the time he's in the business is the entire year, which is 12 months. But wait, B joins after 2 months, so A is in for 12 months. Then B joins, but for how long? Let's see.\n\nB joins after 2 months, so his investment period is from month 2 to the end of the year. That's 10 months. Wait, no, the entire year is 12 months, so if B joins at month 2, he stays for 12-2=10 months? Wait, no, that's not right. Because if you join at the start of month 2, then you're in for 12-2 +1 months? Or is it 10 months? Wait, I think it's 10 months because from month 2 to month 12 is 11 months? No, wait, let's think numerically.\n\nWait, let's say the business runs for 12 months. A starts at month 0. B joins at month 2. So B's investment is for 12 - 2 = 10 months? No, wait, because if the business ends at the end of month 12, then B's investment is from month 2 to month 12, which is 11 months. Because from month 2 to 12 inclusive is 11 months. Because 12-2+1=11.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think in terms of months each person is present.\n\nA: 12 months.\n\nB: joins after 2 months, so for 10 months? Because 12-2=10. Hmm, maybe. Or 11 months? Wait, if he joins at the start of month 3, then until the end of month 12, that's 10 months. Because from month 2 to month 12, but since he starts in month 2, that's 11 months? Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the exact time each person is in the business. Let's say the total time is 12 months. A is in for all 12 months. B joins after 2 months, so his duration is 12 - 2 = 10 months. Wait, but when you join after 2 months, you start at the beginning of the third month, right? So from month 3 to month 12 is 10 months. So B's duration is 10 months.\n\nThen C joins after some more time. Let's call the time C joins as x months after B joined. So how long is C in the business? The total business time is 12 months. So if B joined at 2 months, and C joined x months later, then C's time in the business is 12 - (2 + x) months.\n\nWait, but the question is how many months after B joined did C join. So if B joined at month 2, and C joined y months after that, then C's time is 12 - (2 + y) months. Hmm, but y is the time after B joined, so the total time C is in is 12 - (2 + y) = 10 - y months.\n\nWait, but maybe I should model the duration each person is in the business.\n\nLet me model each person's investment:\n\nA: 40,000 for 12 months.\n\nB: 60,000 for (12 - 2) = 10 months. Because he starts at month 2, so from month 2 to 12, which is 11 months? Or 10 months? Wait, maybe I should count the months as periods. For example, if someone starts in month 2, how many full months are left?\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to model the time each person is in the business as the number of months multiplied by their investment.\n\nSo, the profit is divided in the ratio of (capital \u00d7 time).\n\nSo, the total profit is 375,000, and C gets 150,000.\n\nSo, C's share is (120,000 \u00d7 t_C) / (total ratio) = 150,000.\n\nWhere t_C is the time C was in the business.\n\nWait, let's compute the ratios.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nA's investment: 40,000 \u00d7 12 = 480,000.\n\nB's investment: 60,000 \u00d7 (12 - 2) = 60,000 \u00d710=600,000.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Wait, if B joined after 2 months, he's in for 10 months (since 12-2=10). So 60,000 \u00d710=600,000.\n\nC's investment: 120,000 \u00d7 t, where t is the time C was in the business. We need to find t.\n\nWait, but the problem is that C joined after some time after B. So if B joined after 2 months, let's say C joined y months after B. So, since B is in for 10 months, then C is in for (10 - y) months. Because the total business is 12 months. So if B is in for 10 months (from month 2 to month 12), and C joins y months after B, then C is in for (10 - y) months.\n\nWait, no. Because the business runs for 12 months. So if B joined at month 2, then the time left after that is 10 months. If C joins y months after B, then C's time in the business is (10 - y) months. Because he starts at (2 + y) months, so the time left is 12 - (2 + y) = 10 - y months.\n\nSo, C's investment is 120,000 \u00d7 (10 - y).\n\nNow, the profit is divided based on the product of capital and time.\n\nSo the total ratio is A's + B's + C's.\n\nSo, the ratio is:\n\n40,000 * 12 + 60,000 * 10 + 120,000 * (10 - y) = 480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(10 - y) = 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000 y = 2,280,000 - 120,000 y.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the profit share. Since the total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000.\n\nSo, the ratio of C's share to the total is 150,000 / 375,000 = 1/2.5 = 0.4, which is 40%.\n\nSo, C's investment multiplied by time divided by total ratio equals 0.4.\n\nSo, (120,000 * (10 - y)) / (40,000*12 + 60,000*10 + 120,000*(10 - y)) = 150,000 / 375,000.\n\nWait, but I can compute this equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think of the profit shares as the product of capital and time. So, the ratio of their profits would be:\n\nA : B : C = (40,000 * 12) : (60,000 * 10) : (120,000 * t_C)\n\nWhere t_C is C's time in the business.\n\nThe total profit is 375,000, and C gets 150,000. So, the ratio of C's share to the total is 150,000 / 375,000 = 1/2.5 = 2/5.\n\nWait, no, 150,000 is 150/375 = 2/5 of the total. So, C's share is 2/5 of the total. Wait, 150,000 is 40% of 375,000. Because 375,000 * 0.4 = 150,000.\n\nSo, the ratio of C's contribution to the total contributions is 0.4.\n\nSo, (120,000 * t_C) / (40,000 *12 + 60,000 *10 + 120,000 * t_C) ) = 0.4.\n\nLet me compute the numerator and denominator.\n\nNumerator: 120,000 * t_C.\n\nDenominator: 40,000 *12 = 480,000.\n\n60,000 *10 = 600,000.\n\nSo, 480,000 + 600,000 = 1,080,000.\n\nPlus 120,000 * t_C.\n\nSo denominator is 1,080,000 + 120,000 t_C.\n\nSo,\n\n(120,000 t_C) / (1,080,000 + 120,000 t_C) = 0.4.\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\n120,000 t_C = 0.4 (1,080,000 + 120,000 t_C )\n\nExpand RHS: 0.4 * 1,080,000 = 432,000, 0.4 * 120,000 t_C = 48,000 t_C.\n\nSo,\n\n120,000 t_C = 432,000 + 48,000 t_C.\n\nSubtract 48,000 t_C from both sides:\n\n72,000 t_C = 432,000.\n\nt_C = 432,000 / 72,000.\n\n72,000 times 6 is 432,000.\n\nSo, t_C = 6 months.\n\nWait, so C was in the business for 6 months.\n\nBut wait, how does that fit into the timeline? Because the business runs for 12 months.\n\nIf C was in for 6 months, when did he join?\n\nBecause B joined at month 2, and the business ends at month 12.\n\nSo, C's investment period is 6 months.\n\nSo, if the business is 12 months, and C's investment is for 6 months, then he must have joined at month 12 - 6 + 1? Wait, no, let me think differently.\n\nWait, the time C is in the business is 6 months. So, if he joined at month x, then the time from x to 12 is 6 months. So, x to 12 is 6 months, so x is 12 -6 = 6. So, he joined at month 6.\n\nWait, but B joined at month 2. So, after B joined, how many months passed before C joined?\n\nFrom month 2 to month 6 is 4 months. Because months 2,3,4,5,6: but the time between joining is 4 months.\n\nWait, wait, if B joined at the start of month 2, and C joined at the start of month 6, then the time between is 4 months.\n\nBecause from month 2 to 3 is 1 month, 3 to 4 another, 4 to 5 another, 5 to 6 another. So four months after B joined.\n\nSo, the answer should be 4 months. So option B.\n\nLet me check.\n\nSo, A is in for 12 months, B for 10 months (since he joined at month 2), and C for 6 months (joined at month 6).\n\nCompute their contributions:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000.\n\nB: 60,000 *10 = 600,000.\n\nC: 120,000 *6 = 720,000.\n\nTotal = 480,000 +600,000= 1,080,000 +720,000= 1,800,000.\n\nBut wait, the total profit is 375,000, but the sum here is 1.8 million. That can't be right.\n\nWait, but wait, the profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. So, the ratio of C's contribution to total should be 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4. So, 40%.\n\nLet me compute C's share:\n\nC's contribution is 720,000.\n\nTotal contributions: 480,000 (A) +600,000 (B) +720,000 (C) = 1,800,000.\n\nSo, 720,000 / 1,800,000 = 0.4. Which is 40%, so 150,000 is correct.\n\nSo, the calculations are correct.\n\nBut the question is, how many months after B joined did C join?\n\nB joined at month 2. C joined at month 6. So, the time between is 4 months. So, the correct answer is B) 4 months.\n",

Because 375,000 * 0.4 = 150,000.\n\nSo, the ratio of C's contribution to the total contributions is 0.4.\n\nSo, (120,000 * t_C) / (40,000 *12 + 60,000 *10 + 120,000 * t_C) ) = 0.4.\n\nLet me compute the numerator and denominator.\n\nNumerator: 120,000 * t_C.\n\nDenominator: 40,000 *12 = 480,000.\n\n60,000 *10 = 600,000.\n\nSo, 480,000 + 600,000 = 1,080,000.\n\nPlus 120,000 * t_C.\n\nSo denominator is 1,080,000 + 120,000 t_C.\n\nSo,\n\n(120,000 t_C) / (1,080,000 + 120,000 t_C) = 0.4.\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\n120,000 t_C = 0.4 (1,080,000 + 120,000 t_C )\n\nExpand RHS: 0.4 * 1,080,000 = 432,000, 0.4 * 120,000 t_C = 48,000 t_C.\n\nSo,\n\n120,000 t_C = 432,000 + 48,000 t_C.\n\nSubtract 48,000 t_C from both sides:\n\n72,000 t_C = 432,000.\n\nt_C = 432,000 / 72,000.\n\n72,000 times 6 is 432,000.\n\nSo, t_C = 6 months.\n\nWait, so C was in the business for 6 months.\n\nBut wait, how does that fit into the timeline? Because the business runs for 12 months.\n\nIf C was in for 6 months, when did he join?\n\nBecause B joined at month 2, and the business ends at month 12.\n\nSo, C's investment period is 6 months.\n\nSo, if the business is 12 months, and C's investment is for 6 months, then he must have joined at month 12 - 6 + 1? Wait, no, let me think differently.\n\nWait, the time C is in the business is 6 months. So, if he joined at month x, then the time from x to 12 is 6 months. So, x to 12 is 6 months, so x is 12 -6 = 6. So, he joined at month 6.\n\nWait, but B joined at month 2. So, after B joined, how many months passed before C joined?\n\nFrom month 2 to month 6 is 4 months. Because months 2,3,4,5,6: but the time between joining is 4 months.\n\nWait, wait, if B joined at the start of month 2, and C joined at the start of month 6, then the time between is 4 months.\n\nBecause from month 2 to 3 is 1 month, 3 to 4 another, 4 to 5 another, 5 to 6 another. So four months after B joined.\n\nSo, the answer should be 4 months. So option B.\n\nLet me check.\n\nSo, A is in for 12 months, B for 10 months (since he joined at month 2), and C for 6 months (joined at month 6).\n\nCompute their contributions:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000.\n\nB: 60,000 *10 = 600,000.\n\nC: 120,000 *6 = 720,000.\n\nTotal = 480,000 +600,000= 1,080,000 +720,000= 1,800,000.\n\nBut wait, the total profit is 375,000, but the sum here is 1.8 million. That can't be right.\n\nWait, but wait, the profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. So, the ratio of C's contribution to total should be 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4. So, 40%.\n\nLet me compute C's share:\n\nC's contribution is 720,000.\n\nTotal contributions: 480,000 (A) +600,000 (B) +720,000 (C) = 1,800,000.\n\nSo, 720,000 / 1,800,000 = 0.4. Which is 40%, so 150,000 is correct.\n\nSo, the calculations are correct.\n\nBut the question is, how many months after B joined did C join?\n\nB joined at month 2. C joined at month 6. So, the time between is 4 months. So, the correct answer is B) 4 months.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the timeline and contributions of each partner:\n\n1. **A's Contribution**:  \n   A starts the business with Rs.40,000 and remains in the business for the entire year (12 months).  \n   Contribution = \\( 40,000 \\times 12 = 480,000 \\).\n\n2. **B's Contribution**:  \n   B joins after 2 months with Rs.60,000. Since the business runs for 12 months, B's investment period is \\( 12 - 2 = 10 \\) months.  \n   Contribution = \\( 60,000 \\times 10 = 600,000 \\).\n\n3. **C's Contribution**:  \n   C joins after some time with Rs.120,000. Let \\( t_C \\) be the time C is in the business. C's contribution is \\( 120,000 \\times t_C \\).\n\n4. **Profit Distribution**:  \n   The total profit is Rs.375,000, and C receives Rs.150,000. The profit is distributed based on the ratio of their contributions.  \n   C's share fraction = \\( \\frac{150,000}{375,000} = 0.4 \\).  \n   This means C's contribution divided by the total contributions equals 0.4:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{120,000 \\times t_C}{480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000 \\times t_C} = 0.4\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( t_C \\)**:  \n   Multiply through by the denominator:  \n   \\[\n   120,000 \\times t_C = 0.4 \\times (1,080,000 + 120,000 \\times t_C)\n   \\]  \n   Expand and simplify:  \n   \\[\n   120,000 \\times t_C = 432,000 + 48,000 \\times t_C\n   \\]  \n   Subtract \\( 48,000 \\times t_C \\) from both sides:  \n   \\[\n   72,000 \\times t_C = 432,000\n   \\]  \n   Solve for \\( t_C \\):  \n   \\[\n   t_C = \\frac{432,000}{72,000} = 6 \\, \\text{months}.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Determine When C Joined**:  \n   Since the business runs for 12 months and C is in for 6 months, C must have joined at month \\( 12 - 6 = 6 \\).  \n   B joined at month 2, so the time between B joining and C joining is \\( 6 - 2 = 4 \\) months.\n\nThus, C joined the business 4 months after B.\n\n**Answer: B**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about three people starting a business and figuring out when the third person joined. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says that A starts a business with Rs.40,000. Then, B joins after 2 months with Rs.60,000. After some more time, C joins with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000. I need to find out how many months after B joined did C join.\n\nHmm, so I think this is a problem about partnership and profit sharing based on the time each person has invested their capital. The key here is to calculate each person's share of the profit based on their investment and the time they were in the business.\n\nLet me outline what I know:\n\n- A invested Rs.40,000 for the entire year, I think. Because the problem says A starts the business, so he's there from the beginning. Unless someone else joins later, but A's duration is probably the whole 12 months.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, no. Let me read again. Oh, wait, the question says \"at the end of the year.\" So the business runs for a year, 12 months.\n\nSo A started the business with Rs.40,000. So his investment period is 12 months.\n\nThen, B joins after 2 months with Rs.60,000. So B's investment is for (12 - 2) = 10 months. Wait no, because if the business runs for 12 months, and B joins after 2 months, then B's investment is for 10 months, right?\n\nWait, no. Let's think in terms of when they joined:\n\n- A: from month 0 to month 12 \u2192 12 months.\n\n- B: joined after 2 months, so from month 2 to month 12 \u2192 10 months.\n\n- C: joined after some more time after B. So C's joining is after B's 2 months. Let's say C joined x months after B. So since B joined at month 2, C joined at month (2 + x). So C's investment time is (12 - (2 + x)) months.\n\nWait, wait. Let me clarify. Let me assign variables:\n\nLet me let t be the number of months after B joined that C joined. So B joined at month 2, C joined at month (2 + t). So C's investment period is (12 - (2 + t)) = (10 - t) months.\n\nWait, but wait, that can't be right. Because if t is the time after B joined, then the time C is in the business is (12 - (2 + t)) = 10 - t months. So if t is 2, C would have been in for 8 months. If t is 4, 6 months, etc.\n\nBut wait, the problem says C joined after some more time after B. So t has to be positive, but when C joins, it can't be beyond 12 months. So 2 + t must be <= 12. So t can be up to 10 months.\n\nBut let me think about the profit sharing. The profit is divided based on the product of capital and time. So each partner's share is (capital * time) proportion.\n\nSo the total profit is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000. So C's share is 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4, which is 40% of the profit.\n\nSo the ratio of their shares should be the ratio of (capital * time) each has.\n\nSo let me compute the capital-time for each:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000\n\nB: 60,000 * (10) = 600,000\n\nC: 120,000 * (10 - t) = 120,000 * (10 - t)\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me make sure about B's time. Because the business is for 12 months, B joined after 2 months, so B's time is 12 - 2 = 10 months. Yes.\n\nC's time is (12 - (2 + t)) = 10 - t months.\n\nSo the total capital-time is:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000\n\nB: 60,000 *10 = 600,000\n\nC: 120,000 * (10 - t) = 1,200,000 - 120,000 t\n\nThe sum of these will give the total investment, but I think for profit sharing, each person's share is proportional to their capital multiplied by time.\n\nSo the ratio of A : B : C is 480,000 : 600,000 : (1,200,000 - 120,000 t)\n\nWhich can be written as 480 : 600 : (1200 - 120 t) when we divide each by 1000.\n\nSimplify these:\n\nA: 480\n\nB: 600\n\nC: 1200 - 120t\n\nWe can factor these numbers. Let's see:\n\n480 = 48 * 10\n\n600 = 60 * 10\n\n1200 = 120 *10, so 1200 -120 t = 120(10 - t)\n\nHmm, maybe it's easier to express the ratios as fractions.\n\nThe total parts are 480 + 600 + (1200 -120t) = 480 + 600 = 1080; 1080 + 1200 -120t = 2280 - 120t.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is better. Since C's share is 150,000 and the total is 375,000, which is 40%. So C's ratio is 40% of the total.\n\nSo the ratio of C's capital-time to the total capital-time is 0.4.\n\nSo let's compute C's capital-time divided by the total capital-time equals 0.4.\n\nSo:\n\nC / (A + B + C) = 0.4\n\nSo,\n\n(120,000 * (10 - t)) / (40,000*12 + 60,000*10 + 120,000*(10 -t)) = 0.4\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\n40,000 *12 = 480,000\n\n60,000 *10 = 600,000\n\nSo denominator is 480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(10 - t)\n\nWhich is 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000 t = 2,280,000 - 120,000 t\n\nC's capital-time is 120,000*(10 -t) = 1,200,000 -120,000 t.\n\nSo,\n\n(1,200,000 -120,000 t) / (2,280,000 -120,000 t) = 0.4\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\n1,200,000 - 120,000 t = 0.4 * (2,280,000 -120,000 t)\n\nLet me compute the right side:\n\n0.4 *2,280,000 = 912,000\n\n0.4 * (-120,000 t) = -48,000 t\n\nSo,\n\n1,200,000 -120,000 t = 912,000 -48,000 t\n\nLet me bring all terms to left:\n\n1,200,000 -120,000 t -912,000 +48,000 t = 0\n\nCompute:\n\n1,200,000 - 912,000 = 288,000\n\n-120,000 t +48,000 t = -72,000 t\n\nSo,\n\n288,000 -72,000 t = 0\n\nRearranged:\n\n72,000 t = 288,000\n\nt = 288,000 / 72,000 = 4.\n\nSo t is 4 months.\n\nWait, that would mean that C joined 4 months after B. Since B joined after 2 months, C joined 2 +4 =6 months after the start. So in terms of the business, C was there for 12 -6 =6 months.\n\nLet me check the math again to make sure.\n\nLet me plug t=4 into the equation.\n\nC's capital-time: 120,000 * (10 -4) = 120,000 *6=720,000.\n\nA's:480,000\n\nB's:600,000\n\nTotal: 480,000 +600,000 +720,000 = 1,800,000.\n\nC's share: 720,000 /1,800,000 = 0.4 \u2192 40%, which matches the given 150,000/375,000 = 0.4.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the answer should be 4 months after B joined. So the correct option is B)4 months.\n",

So his investment period is 12 months.\n\nThen, B joins after 2 months with Rs.60,000. So B's investment is for (12 - 2) = 10 months.

So C's ratio is 40% of the total.\n\nSo the ratio of C's capital-time to the total capital-time is 0.4.\n\nSo let's compute C's capital-time divided by the total capital-time equals 0.4.\n\nSo:\n\nC / (A + B + C) = 0.4\n\nSo,\n\n(120,000 * (10 - t)) / (40,000*12 + 60,000*10 + 120,000*(10 -t)) = 0.4\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\n40,000 *12 = 480,000\n\n60,000 *10 = 600,000\n\nSo denominator is 480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(10 - t)\n\nWhich is 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000 t = 2,280,000 - 120,000 t\n\nC's capital-time is 120,000*(10 -t) = 1,200,000 -120,000 t.\n\nSo,\n\n(1,200,000 -120,000 t) / (2,280,000 -120,000 t) = 0.4\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\n1,200,000 - 120,000 t = 0.4 * (2,280,000 -120,000 t)\n\nLet me compute the right side:\n\n0.4 *2,280,000 = 912,000\n\n0.4 * (-120,000 t) = -48,000 t\n\nSo,\n\n1,200,000 -120,000 t = 912,000 -48,000 t\n\nLet me bring all terms to left:\n\n1,200,000 -120,000 t -912,000 +48,000 t = 0\n\nCompute:\n\n1,200,000 - 912,000 = 288,000\n\n-120,000 t +48,000 t = -72,000 t\n\nSo,\n\n288,000 -72,000 t = 0\n\nRearranged:\n\n72,000 t = 288,000\n\nt = 288,000 / 72,000 = 4.\n\nSo t is 4 months.\n\nWait, that would mean that C joined 4 months after B. Since B joined after 2 months, C joined 2 +4 =6 months after the start. So in terms of the business, C was there for 12 -6 =6 months.\n\nLet me check the math again to make sure.\n\nLet me plug t=4 into the equation.\n\nC's capital-time: 120,000 * (10 -4) = 120,000 *6=720,000.\n\nA's:480,000\n\nB's:600,000\n\nTotal: 480,000 +600,000 +720,000 = 1,800,000.\n\nC's share: 720,000 /1,800,000 = 0.4 \u2192 40%, which matches the given 150,000/375,000 = 0.4.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the answer should be 4 months after B joined. So the correct option is B)4 months.\n\n\nTo determine how many months after B joined the business that C joined, we analyze the profit-sharing ratio based on the capital and time each partner contributed.\n\n### Key Information:\n1. **A's Contribution**: A invested Rs. 40,000 for the entire year (12 months).\n2. **B's Contribution**: B joined after 2 months with Rs. 60,000 and stayed for 10 months (12 - 2).\n3. **C's Contribution**: C joined after some time with Rs. 120,000 and stayed for \\(10 - t\\) months, where \\(t\\) is the number of months after B joined that C joined.\n4. **Total Profit**: Rs. 375,000, with C receiving Rs. 150,000, which is 40% of the total profit.\n\n### Profit-Sharing Ratio:\nThe profit is distributed based on the product of capital and time for each partner. Let:\n- \\(A_{\\text{capital-time}} = 40,000 \\times 12 = 480,000\\),\n- \\(B_{\\text{capital-time}} = 60,000 \\times 10 = 600,000\\),\n- \\(C_{\\text{capital-time}} = 120,000 \\times (10 - t)\\).\n\nThe total capital-time is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total} = 480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000 \\times (10 - t) = 2,280,000 - 120,000t.\n\\]\n\nC's share of the profit is 40%, so:\n\\[\n\\frac{C_{\\text{capital-time}}}{\\text{Total}} = 0.4.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(C_{\\text{capital-time}} = 120,000 \\times (10 - t)\\) and solving:\n\\[\n\\frac{120,000 \\times (10 - t)}{2,280,000 - 120,000t} = 0.4.\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\\[\n1,200,000 - 120,000t = 0.4 \\times (2,280,000 - 120,000t),\n\\]\n\\[\n1,200,000 - 120,000t = 912,000 - 48,000t.\n\\]\n\nRearrange:\n\\[\n288,000 - 72,000t = 0,\n\\]\n\\[\nt = \\frac{288,000}{72,000} = 4.\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(t = 4\\), meaning C joined 4 months after B.\n\n### Final Answer:\nC joined 4 months after B joined the business.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this business partnership problem. Let me read it carefully.\n\nSo, A starts a business with Rs.40,000. Two months later, B joins with Rs.60,000. Then, C joins after some more time with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000. I need to find out how many months after B joined did C join.\n\nHmm, I think I remember that in partnership problems, the profit is divided based on the time each person's investment was in the business and the amount they invested. So it's like calculating their individual contributions multiplied by the time they were in the business, and then the profit is divided according to that ratio.\n\nLet me outline the details:\n\n- A invests Rs.40,000 for the entire year. But wait, when did B and C join? Because A started first, then B joined after 2 months, and C after some more time.\n\nWait, the time each person's money was in the business is important. So A started with 40,000, and was there for the entire duration. Let's think about the timeline.\n\nThe business runs for a total of 12 months. Let me break down the periods each person's investment was active.\n\nA started at month 0. So A's investment is for 12 months.\n\nB joined after 2 months, so B's investment was from month 2 to month 12. So that's 12 - 2 = 10 months.\n\nC joined after some time after B. Let's say C joined x months after B. Since B joined at month 2, C joined at month (2 + x). But how long was C in the business? The total time is 12 months, so C's investment was for (12 - (2 + x)) months. Wait, that would be 10 - x months. Wait, but x is the time after B joined, so the total time C is in is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months? Hmm, wait, no, because if C joined at (2 + x) months, then the time until the end of the year is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months. So C's time is 10 - x months.\n\nWait, but that can't be right if x is the time after B. Let me think again. Suppose B joined at month 2, and C joined x months later. So C joined at month (2 + x). Then the time C was in is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months. So C's time is 10 - x months.\n\nWait, but wait, if x is the number of months after B joined, then for example, if x is 0, C would join at month 2, same as B, and stay for 10 months. If x is 4, then C joins at month 6 and stays for 6 months. So the formula seems correct.\n\nNow, the profit is divided in the ratio of their investments multiplied by the time they were in. So each person's share is (capital * time) and the total profit is divided based on the sum of these.\n\nSo the profit is 375,000, and C gets 150,000. So C's share is 150,000. Let's find the ratio of their shares.\n\nThe ratio of A : B : C is (A's capital * A's time) : (B's capital * B's time) : (C's capital * C's time).\n\nSo A's capital is 40,000 for 12 months \u2192 40,000 * 12 = 480,000.\n\nB's capital is 60,000 for 10 months \u2192 60,000 *10 = 600,000.\n\nC's capital is 120,000 for (10 - x) months \u2192 120,000*(10 -x) = 1,200,000 - 120,000x.\n\nThe total of all these is 480,000 + 600,000 + (1,200,000 - 120,000x) = 480,000 + 600,000 is 1,080,000 plus 1,200,000 is 2,280,000 minus 120,000x. So total = 2,280,000 - 120,000x.\n\nWait, but the profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. So the ratio of C's share to the total is 150,000 / 375,000 = 1/2.5, which is 0.4, or 40%. So C's share is 40% of the total profit.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of all the (capital * time) is the total, and each person's share is proportional to their part.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of (A's, B's, C's) contributions is 480,000 + 600,000 + (1,200,000 -120,000x) = 2,280,000 -120,000x.\n\nWait, but how is the profit distributed? Because profit is divided based on the ratio of their contributions. So each person's share is (their contribution) / (total contribution) * total profit.\n\nSo C's share is (1,200,000 - 120,000x) / (2,280,000 -120,000x) = 150,000 / 375,000.\n\nSimplify 150,000 / 375,000 \u2192 1/2.5 \u2192 0.4.\n\nSo (1,200,000 -120,000x) / (2,280,000 -120,000x) = 0.4.\n\nLet me write that equation:\n\n(1,200,000 - 120,000x) / (2,280,000 - 120,000x) = 0.4.\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\n1,200,000 -120,000x = 0.4*(2,280,000 -120,000x).\n\nLet me compute 0.4 * 2,280,000 \u2192 0.4 * 2,280,000 = 912,000.\n\n0.4 * (-120,000x) = -48,000x.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n1,200,000 - 120,000x = 912,000 -48,000x.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n1,200,000 -912,000 = 120,000x -48,000x.\n\nCompute 1,200,000 -912,000 \u2192 288,000.\n\n120,000x -48,000x =72,000x.\n\nSo 288,000 =72,000x.\n\nDivide both sides by 72,000:\n\nx=288,000 /72,000 =4.\n\nWait, x is 4. So C joined 4 months after B.\n\nWait, but the question is how many months after B joined did C join? So x=4 months.\n\nSo the answer should be option B)4 months.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nIf x=4, then C joined 4 months after B. Since B joined at month 2, C joined at month 6.\n\nSo C's time in the business is 12 -6=6 months.\n\nSo C's contribution is 120,000 *6=720,000.\n\nA's contribution is 40,000 *12=480,000.\n\nB's contribution is 60,000 *10=600,000.\n\nTotal contribution:480,000 +600,000 +720,000=1,800,000.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the total was 2,280,000 -120,000x. Let me plug x=4:\n\n2,280,000 -120,000*4=2,280,000-480,000=1,800,000. Correct.\n\nC's share is 720,000/1,800,000=0.4. So 0.4 *375,000=150,000. Which matches.\n\nSo yes, x=4 is correct.\n",

The profit is distributed proportionally to the product of capital and time for each partner.\n\n### Details:\n- **A** invests **Rs. 40,000** for the entire **12 months**, so A's contribution is:\n  \\[\n  40,000 \\times 12 = 480,000\n  \\]\n- **B** joins after **2 months** and invests **Rs. 60,000** for **10 months** (from month 2 to month 12), so B's contribution is:\n  \\[\n  60,000 \\times 10 = 600,000\n  \\]\n- **C** joins **x months after B** (i.e., at month \\(2 + x\\)) and invests **Rs. 120,000** for \\(12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x\\) months, so C's contribution is:\n  \\[\n  120,000 \\times (10 - x) = 1,200,000 - 120,000x\n  \\]\n\nThe total contribution is:\n\\[\n480,000 + 600,000 + (1,200,000 - 120,000x) = 2,280,000 - 120,000x\n\\]\n\nC's share of the profit is given as **Rs. 150,000**, and the total profit is **Rs. 375,000**. Therefore, the ratio of C's contribution to the total contribution is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1,200,000 - 120,000x}{2,280,000 - 120,000x} = \\frac{150,000}{375,000} = 0.4\n\\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\\[\n1,200,000 - 120,000x = 0.4 \\times (2,280,000 - 120,000x)\n\\]\n\\[\n1,200,000 - 120,000x = 912,000 - 48,000x\n\\]\n\\[\n1,200,000 - 912,000 = 120,000x - 48,000x\n\\]\n\\[\n288,000 = 72,000x\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{288,000}{72,000} = 4\n\\]\n\nThus, C joined **4 months after B**.\n\nAnswer: B",
