      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about population growth, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question says that the population increases by 5% annually, and we need to find out what the population will be in two years if it's currently 78,000.\n\nWait, I remember that percentage increase can be calculated using multiplication. So each year, the population is multiplied by 1 plus the percentage as a decimal. Since it's a 5% increase, that would be 1.05, right?\n\nSo the formula for compound growth is probably the right approach here. Because the population grows each year based on the previous year's population, it's not just a simple addition of 5% twice. Let me think: for two years, it's 78,000 multiplied by 1.05 for the first year, then that result multiplied by 1.05 again for the second year.\n\nLet me break it down. First year's population would be 78,000 * 1.05. Let me calculate that. 78,000 times 1.05. Hmm, 78,000 * 1 is 78,000. 78,000 * 0.05 is 3,900. So adding those together, that's 81,900. So after the first year, the population is 81,900.\n\nNow, the second year. We take that 81,900 and multiply by 1.05 again. Let's see, 81,900 * 1.05. Breaking it down: 81,900 * 1 is 81,900. 81,900 * 0.05 is... 5% of 80,000 is 4,000, and 5% of 1,900 is 95. So 4,000 +95 is 4,095. So adding that to 81,900, we get 81,900 + 4,095 = 85,995.\n\nWait, let me double-check that math. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 81,900 * 1.05 directly. 81,900 multiplied by 1.05. Hmm, another way to compute is 81,900 + (81,900 * 0.05). So 81,900 * 0.05 is 4,095. So adding that gives 81,900 + 4,095 = 85,995.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 85,995. Option C is 85,800, which is close but a bit lower. So I think B is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but wait another second. Could I have made a mistake in my multiplication? Let me try calculating 81,900 * 1.05 another way. Maybe breaking it down into 80,000 and 1,900.\n\n80,000 *1.05 is 84,000. 1,900 *1.05 is 1,995. Adding them together gives 84,000 + 1,995 = 85,995. Yep, same result. So that seems correct.\n\nSo the population after two years should be 85,995, which is option B. But let me check the options again. Oh, wait, option E is \"None of these.\" Could it be that the correct answer isn't among the options?\n\nLooking back, the options are A)81900, B)85995, C)85800, D)90000, E)None.\n\nSince B is 85995, which is what I calculated, then the correct answer should be B. So E isn't needed here. So the answer is B.\n",

The options are given, and I have to pick the correct one.\n\nHmm, I remember that percentage increase can be calculated using the formula for compound growth. Because each year's population depends on the previous year's population increasing by 5%. So it's not just adding 5% once, but twice, each time on the new amount.\n\nLet me think about the formula. I think it's something like P = P0 * (1 + r)^t, where P0 is the initial population, r is the rate, and t is time. So in this case, P0 is 78,000, r is 5% which is 0.05, and t is 2 years.\n\nWait, but maybe I should calculate it year by year to make sure I don't make a mistake. Let me try that approach first.\n\nSo, first year: 78,000 plus 5% of that. Let me calculate 5% of 78,000. 5% is the same as 0.05, so 78,000 * 0.05 = 3,900. Adding that to 78,000 gives 81,900. That's the population after the first year.\n\nThen, the second year, the population increases by another 5%. So I take 81,900 and add 5% of it. Let me compute 81,900 * 0.05. Hmm, 80,000 * 0.05 is 4,000, and 1,900 *0.05 is 95. So 4,000 +95=4,095. So adding that to 81,900 gives 81,900 +4,095 = 85,995.\n\nWait, looking at the options, option B is 85,995. So that's one possibility.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula: 78,000 * (1.05)^2. Let me compute that. 1.05 squared is 1.1025. So 78,000 *1.1025. Let's calculate that.\n\n78,000 *1.1025. Maybe I can break it down. 78,000 *1.1 is 85,800, and then 78,000 *0.0025 is 195. So adding those together, 85,800 +195=85,995. Yep, same result as before.\n\nLooking at the options again: option B is 85,995, which matches. So the correct answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other option. Option C is 85,800, which is exactly the 5% increase once, but that's only after one year. So that's not the case here. Option A is 81,900, which is the first year's population. So no, that's not after two years. Option D is 90,000, which seems too high. So the only correct option is B.\n",

The options are A to E, with E being none of these. \n\nHmm, I remember that percentage increases can be calculated by multiplying the current amount by (1 plus the percentage as a decimal). So 5% would be 0.05, so 1 + 0.05 is 1.05. \n\nWait, but since it's increasing annually, I think I need to apply the 5% increase each year, for two years. Oh right, because the increase is compounded annually. So each year's population becomes the base for the next year's increase.\n\nLet me break it down. The first year: current population is 78,000. After a 5% increase, the population will be 78,000 * 1.05. Let me calculate that. \n\n78,000 multiplied by 1.05. Hmm, 78,000 * 1 is 78,000, and 78,000 * 0.05 is 3,900. So adding those together gives 78,000 + 3,900 = 81,900. So after the first year, it's 81,900.\n\nNow, for the second year, we take that 81,900 and increase it by another 5%. So again, multiply by 1.05. Let me calculate 81,900 * 1.05. \n\nBreaking that down, 81,900 * 1 is 81,900. 81,900 * 0.05 is 4,095. Adding those together: 81,900 + 4,095. Let me do that addition. 81,900 plus 4,000 is 85,900, and then plus 95 makes 85,995. So after two years, the population should be 85,995.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 85,995. So that should be the correct answer. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake with the numbers. \n\nFirst year: 78,000 * 1.05. 78,000 * 0.05 is 3,900. So 78,000 + 3,900 = 81,900. That's correct. \n\nSecond year: 81,900 * 0.05. Let's compute 81,900 * 5% again. 81,900 divided by 20 is 4,095 (since 5% is 1/20). So yes, 4,095 added to 81,900 gives 85,995. \n\nSo the correct answer must be B. But wait, what about the option C, which is 85,800. Did I miscalculate somewhere?\n\nWait, another way to compute the two-year growth is to use the formula for compound interest: P = P0 * (1 + r)^t. Here, P0 is 78,000, r is 0.05, t is 2. So P = 78000 * (1.05)^2.\n\nCalculating (1.05)^2: 1.05 * 1.05 = 1.1025. So 78,000 * 1.1025.\n\nLet me compute that. 78,000 * 1.1025.\n\nWell, 78,000 * 1 is 78,000. 78,000 * 0.10 is 7,800. 78,000 * 0.0025 is 195. So adding those together: 78,000 + 7,800 = 85,800. Then 85,800 + 195 = 85,995. Oh wait, so that's the same as before. So option B is correct.\n\nBut why is option C there? Let me see what 78,000 * 1.05^2 is. Wait, another way: 78,000 * 1.05 is 81,900. Then 81,900 *1.05 is 85,995. So yes, same as before.\n\nSo the correct answer should be B, 85,995. Looking at the options, that's option B.

Let me do that addition. 81,900 plus 4,000 is 85,900, and then plus 95 makes 85,995. So after two years, the population should be 85,995.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 85,995. So that should be the correct answer. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake with the numbers. \n\nFirst year: 78,000 * 1.05. 78,000 * 0.05 is 3,900. So 78,000 + 3,900 = 81,900. That's correct. \n\nSecond year: 81,900 * 0.05. Let's compute 81,900 * 5% again. 81,900 divided by 20 is 4,095 (since 5% is 1/20). So yes, 4,095 added to 81,900 gives 85,995. \n\nSo the correct answer must be B. But wait, what about the option C, which is 85,800. Did I miscalculate somewhere?\n\nWait, another way to compute the two-year growth is to use the formula for compound interest: P = P0 * (1 + r)^t. Here, P0 is 78,000, r is 0.05, t is 2. So P = 78000 * (1.05)^2.\n\nCalculating (1.05)^2: 1.05 * 1.05 = 1.1025. So 78,000 * 1.1025.\n\nLet me compute that. 78,000 * 1.1025.\n\nWell, 78,000 * 1 is 78,000. 78,000 * 0.10 is 7,800. 78,000 * 0.0025 is 195. So adding those together: 78,000 + 7,800 = 85,800. Then 85,800 + 195 = 85,995. Oh wait, so that's the same as before. So option B is correct.\n\nBut why is option C there? Let me see what 78,000 * 1.05^2 is. Wait, another way: 78,000 * 1.05 is 81,900. Then 81,900 *1.05 is 85,995. So yes, same as before.\n\nSo the correct answer should be B, 85,995. Looking at the options, that's option B. So the answer is B.\n\n\nTo determine the population of the city in 2 years, we use the formula for compound growth: \n\n\\[\nP = P_0 \\times (1 + r)^t\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(P_0 = 78,000\\) (current population),\n- \\(r = 0.05\\) (annual growth rate),\n- \\(t = 2\\) (number of years).\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the population after the first year\nThe population after the first year is:\n\\[\nP_1 = P_0 \\times (1 + r) = 78,000 \\times 1.05 = 81,900\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the population after the second year\nThe population after the second year is:\n\\[\nP_2 = P_1 \\times (1 + r) = 81,900 \\times 1.05 = 85,995\n\\]\n\n### Verification Using the Compound Growth Formula\nUsing the formula directly:\n\\[\nP = 78,000 \\times (1.05)^2 = 78,000 \\times 1.1025 = 85,995\n\\]\n\nBoth methods confirm that the population after 2 years is **85,995**.\n\n### Analysis of Options\n- **A) 81,900**: This is the population after the first year, not the second year.\n- **B) 85,995**: This matches the calculated population after 2 years.\n- **C) 85,800**: This is incorrect and does not match the calculation.\n- **D) 90,000**: This is far too high and incorrect.\n- **E) None of these**: This is unnecessary since the correct answer is listed.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **B) 85,995**.\n\nAnswer: B",

Let me do that step by step. 78,000 times 0.05 is 3,900. Adding that to 78,000 gives 81,900. So after the first year, the population is 81,900.

Maybe I should double-check my calculations. Let me recalculate 78,000 * 1.05 squared.\n\n1.05^2 is 1.1025.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about population growth, and I'm supposed to figure out the population after two years. Hmm, let's see. The current population is 78,000, and it increases by 5% each year. I need to find out what it'll be in two years.\n\nWait, I remember that percentage increases can be calculated by multiplying the current amount by (1 + the percentage in decimal form). So for 5%, that's 0.05. Oh right, because 5% is the same as 5 per hundred, so 0.05.\n\nSo the formula for compound growth, like each year's population is the previous year's population multiplied by 1.05, right? Because 5% increase each year.\n\nLet me break it down step by step. First, calculate the population after the first year. So 78,000 times 1.05. Let me do that math. 78,000 multiplied by 1.05.\n\nWait, 78,000 times 1 is 78,000, and 78,000 times 0.05 is 3,900. So adding those together gives 78,000 + 3,900 = 81,900. So after the first year, the population is 81,900.\n\nNow, the second year. I take that 81,900 and multiply by 1.05 again. Let's see, 81,900 * 1.05. Hmm, maybe I can compute it step by step. 81,900 * 1 is 81,900. 81,900 * 0.05 is... let's see, 80,000 * 0.05 is 4,000, and 1,900 *0.05 is 95. So 4,000 + 95 = 4,095. So adding that to 81,900 gives 81,900 + 4,095 = 85,995.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is 85,995. So that's one of the choices.\n\nBut wait, another approach: maybe using the formula for compound interest, which is P = P0*(1 + r)^t. Here, P0 is 78,000, r is 0.05, t is 2.\n\nSo P = 78,000 * (1.05)^2. Let me compute 1.05 squared. 1.05 * 1.05 is 1.1025. So 78,000 * 1.1025.\n\nLet me calculate that. 78,000 * 1 = 78,000. 78,000 * 0.10 is 7,800. 78,000 * 0.0025 is... hmm, 0.0025 is a quarter of a percent. So 78,000 * 0.0025 = 195. So adding those together: 78,000 +7,800 is 85,800, plus 195 makes 85,995. So same as before.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 85,995. So that's the correct answer. But wait, let me double-check the options. Option C is 85,800, which is what I get before adding the 195, right? So maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, wait, let me recalculate 78,000 *1.1025. Let's break it down more accurately.\n\nFirst, 78,000 * 1 = 78,000.\n\n78,000 * 0.10 = 7,800.\n\n78,000 * 0.0025: 78,000 * 0.002 is 156, and 78,000 *0.0005 is 39. So 156 +39=195.\n\nAdding all together: 78,000 +7,800 = 85,800. 85,800 +195 = 85,995. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about population growth, and I'm supposed to figure out the population after two years. Hmm, let's see. The current population is 78,000, and it increases by 5% each year. I need to find out what it'll be in two years.\n\nWait, I remember that percentage increases can be calculated by multiplying the current amount by (1 + the percentage in decimal form). So for 5%, that's 0.05. Oh right, because 5% is the same as 5 per hundred, so 0.05.\n\nSo the formula for compound growth, like each year's population is the previous year's population multiplied by 1.05, right? Because 5% increase each year.\n\nLet me break it down step by step. First, calculate the population after the first year. So 78,000 times 1.05. Let me do that math. 78,000 multiplied by 1.05.\n\nWait, 78,000 times 1 is 78,000, and 78,000 times 0.05 is 3,900. So adding those together gives 78,000 + 3,900 = 81,900. So after the first year, the population is 81,900.\n\nNow, the second year. I take that 81,900 and multiply by 1.05 again. Let's see, 81,900 * 1.05. Hmm, maybe I can compute it step by step. 81,900 * 1 is 81,900. 81,900 * 0.05 is... let's see, 80,000 * 0.05 is 4,000, and 1,900 *0.05 is 95. So 4,000 + 95 = 4,095. So adding that to 81,900 gives 81,900 + 4,095 = 85,995.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is 85,995. So that's one of the choices.\n\nBut wait, another approach: maybe using the formula for compound interest, which is P = P0*(1 + r)^t. Here, P0 is 78,000, r is 0.05, t is 2.\n\nSo P = 78,000 * (1.05)^2. Let me compute 1.05 squared. 1.05 * 1.05 is 1.1025. So 78,000 * 1.1025.\n\nLet me calculate that. 78,000 * 1 = 78,000. 78,000 * 0.10 is 7,800. 78,000 * 0.0025 is... hmm, 0.0025 is a quarter of a percent. So 78,000 * 0.0025 = 195. So adding those together: 78,000 +7,800 is 85,800, plus 195 makes 85,995. So same as before.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 85,995. So that's the correct answer. But wait, let me double-check the options. Option C is 85,800, which is what I get before adding the 195, right? So maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, wait, let me recalculate 78,000 *1.1025. Let's break it down more accurately.\n\nFirst, 78,000 * 1 = 78,000.\n\n78,000 * 0.10 = 7,800.\n\n78,000 * 0.0025: 78,000 * 0.002 is 156, and 78,000 *0.0005 is 39. So 156 +39=195.\n\nAdding all together: 78,000 +7,800 = 85,800. 85,800 +195 = 85,995. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B. But looking at the options, option C is 85,800, which is the population after one year if you added 5% once, but no, wait, after the first year it's 81,900, then the second year brings it to 85,995.

So the correct way is to apply the 5% each year on the new population.\n\nSo the answer should be 85,995, which is option B.\n\n\nTo determine the population of the city after 2 years with an annual growth rate of 5%, we use the formula for compound growth:\n\n\\[\nP = P_0 \\times (1 + r)^t\n\\]\n\nHere:\n- \\( P_0 = 78,000 \\) (current population),\n- \\( r = 0.05 \\) (5% growth rate),\n- \\( t = 2 \\) (number of years).\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the population after the first year\n\\[\nP_1 = P_0 \\times (1 + r) = 78,000 \\times 1.05 = 81,900\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the population after the second year\n\\[\nP_2 = P_1 \\times (1 + r) = 81,900 \\times 1.05\n\\]\nBreaking this down:\n\\[\n81,900 \\times 1.05 = 81,900 + (81,900 \\times 0.05) = 81,900 + 4,095 = 85,995\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Verify using the compound growth formula\n\\[\nP = 78,000 \\times (1.05)^2 = 78,000 \\times 1.1025\n\\]\nBreaking this down:\n\\[\n78,000 \\times 1.1025 = 78,000 + (78,000 \\times 0.10) + (78,000 \\times 0.0025) = 78,000 + 7,800 + 195 = 85,995\n\\]\n\nThus, the population after 2 years is **85,995**, which corresponds to option **B**. \n\n### Analysis of Options:\n- **A) 81,900**: This is the population after the first year, not the second year.\n- **B) 85,995**: Correct, as calculated above.\n- **C) 85,800**: Incorrect, this would result from adding 5% of the original population twice, which is simple interest, not compound growth.\n- **D) 90,000**: Incorrect, as it overestimates the growth.\n- **E) None of these**: Incorrect, as option **B** is correct.\n\nAnswer: B",

Like, first for the first year and then on the new amount for the second year. Yeah, that makes sense because each year's increase is based on the previous year's population.\n\nLet me write down the formula. For the first year, the population will be 78,000 multiplied by 1.05. Let me calculate that. 78,000 * 1.05. Hmm, 78,000 times 1 is 78,000, and 78,000 times 0.05 is 3,900. So adding those together gives 81,900.

Yep, same result.\n\nSo the correct answer is B)85,995.\n\n\nTo calculate the population of the city after 2 years with an annual growth rate of 5%, we use the formula for compound growth:\n\n\\[\nP = P_0 \\times (1 + r)^t\n\\]\n\nHere:\n- \\( P_0 = 78,000 \\) (initial population),\n- \\( r = 0.05 \\) (5% annual growth rate),\n- \\( t = 2 \\) (number of years).\n\nFirst, calculate \\( (1 + r)^t \\):\n\\[\n(1.05)^2 = 1.1025\n\\]\n\nNext, multiply this by the initial population:\n\\[\nP = 78,000 \\times 1.1025 = 85,995\n\\]\n\nThus, the population after 2 years will be **85,995**. Among the options provided:\n- Option A corresponds to the population after 1 year (81,900),\n- Option B matches the calculated value (85,995),\n- Option C is slightly lower (85,800),\n- Option D is higher (90,000),\n- Option E is incorrect since the correct value is listed.\n\nThe correct answer is **B) 85,995**.\n\nAnswer: B",
