      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about a wire shaped into a rectangle, and then it's rebent into a square. I need to find the length of each side of the square. \n\nWait, right, when you bend a wire into a shape, the total length of the wire remains the same. Oh, right, because the wire isn't being stretched or shrunk; it's just changing shape. So the perimeter of the rectangle must be equal to the perimeter of the square. Got it.\n\nThe rectangle has a length and a breadth. The length is 27 cm, and the breadth is 17 cm. So the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as 2*(length + breadth). Let me compute that. \n\nSo 2 times (27 plus 17). Let's see, 27 plus 17 is 44. Then multiply by 2, that's 88 cm. So the perimeter of the rectangle is 88 cm. \n\nNow, when the wire is rebent into a square, the perimeter remains the same, 88 cm. The perimeter of a square is 4 times the length of one side. So if I let 's' be the length of a side of the square, then 4s equals 88. \n\nTo find 's', I can divide both sides by 4. So 88 divided by 4 is... 22. So each side of the square is 22 cm long. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 22. So that should be the correct answer.\n",

I need to find the length of each side of the square. Hmm, right.\n\nWait, I remember that when you bend a wire into different shapes, the total length of the wire stays the same. Oh right, because you're just changing the shape, not adding or removing any material. So the perimeter of the rectangle must equal the perimeter of the square after it's bent.\n\nLet me think. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as 2 times (length plus breadth). So for this rectangle, the length is 27 cm and the breadth is 17 cm. So the perimeter would be 2*(27 + 17). Let me compute that. 27 plus 17 is 44. Multiply by 2 gives 88 cm. So the perimeter is 88 cm.\n\nNow, when this wire is bent into a square, the perimeter remains 88 cm. A square has four sides of equal length. So the perimeter of the square is 4 times the length of one side. Let me denote the side as 's'. So 4*s = 88 cm. To find 's', I divide both sides by 4. 88 divided by 4 is 22. So each side is 22 cm.\n\nWait, looking at the options: A is 9, B 11, C 22, D 25, E 31. So 22 is option C. That must be the correct answer.\n\nJust making sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me recalculate. 27 plus 17 is 44. Multiply by 2: 88 cm perimeter. Square's perimeter is 4s=88, so s=22.

Wait, let me just double-check my calculations.\n\nOriginal perimeter: 2*(27+17) = 2*44 = 88. Square perimeter: 4s=88 \u2192 s=22. Yep, that looks right. So the answer should be C.\n\n\nThe wire is initially bent into a rectangle with length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm. The perimeter of the rectangle is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter of rectangle} = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{breadth}) = 2 \\times (27 + 17) = 2 \\times 44 = 88 \\, \\text{cm}.\n\\]\n\nWhen the wire is rebent into a square, the perimeter of the square remains the same at 88 cm. The perimeter of a square is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter of square} = 4 \\times \\text{side length}.\n\\]\n\nLet \\( s \\) be the side length of the square. Then:\n\n\\[\n4s = 88 \\implies s = \\frac{88}{4} = 22 \\, \\text{cm}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the measure of each side of the square is **22 cm**, which corresponds to option C.\n\nAnswer: C",

Hmm, I remember that when you reshape a wire, the total length remains the same because you're just bending it, not adding or removing any material. So the perimeter should stay constant.\n\nThe original shape is a rectangle. The length is 27 cm and the breadth is 17 cm. I think the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as 2*(length + breadth). Let me plug in the numbers. So that would be 2*(27 + 17). Wait, 27 plus 17 is 44, and then multiplied by 2 gives 88 cm. So the perimeter is 88 cm.\n\nNow, the wire is rebent into a square. The perimeter of a square is 4 times the length of one side. So if I let 's' be the length of each side, the perimeter would be 4s. Since the perimeter doesn't change, I can set up the equation 4s = 88 cm. To find 's', I just divide both sides by 4. Let me do that: 88 divided by 4 is 22.
