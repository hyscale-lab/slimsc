      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question says that a certain liquid passes through a drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. Then, they're asking how many minutes it will take y gallons to pass through the drain at that rate. The options are given, and I need to pick the right one.\n\nHmm, I think I should start by understanding the rate. The rate is given as w/25 gallons per x seconds. So, that's like saying every x seconds, w/25 gallons go through. But I need to find the time in minutes, so maybe I should convert the rate into gallons per minute or something like that.\n\nWait, right. The rate is in gallons per second, but I need the time in minutes. So perhaps I should find the rate in gallons per minute first.\n\nLet me write down the given rate: (w/25) gallons every x seconds. To find the rate per second, I can divide that by x, right? So rate per second is (w/25) / x, which is w/(25x) gallons per second.\n\nBut wait, I need to find the time when y gallons have passed. So, time is equal to amount divided by rate. So time in seconds would be y divided by (w/(25x)).\n\nLet me compute that. Time in seconds = y / (w/(25x)) = y * (25x/w) = (25xy)/w seconds.\n\nBut the question asks for the time in minutes. So I need to convert seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so I divide by 60.\n\nSo time in minutes = (25xy)/(w * 60) = (25xy)/(60w). Let me simplify that fraction. Both 25 and 60 are divisible by 5. 25 divided by 5 is 5, 60 divided by 5 is 12. So that becomes (5xy)/(12w). \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 5xy/(12w). So that must be the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\n1. Rate is w/25 gallons per x seconds. So rate per second is (w/25)/x = w/(25x) g/s.\n2. Time to pass y gallons is y / (w/(25x)) = y * 25x/w = (25xy)/w seconds.\n3. Convert to minutes: (25xy/w) / 60 = (25xy)/(60w) = (5xy)/(12w) after simplifying.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the answer should be option C.\n",

Wait, so in x seconds, it's w/25 gallons. I think I can find the rate per second first. Like, the rate would be (w/25) divided by x, right?

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so I think I can find the rate per minute by multiplying by 60.\n\nLet me calculate that. Rate per minute would be (w/(25x)) * 60 = (60w)/(25x). Simplify that, 60 divided by 25 is like 2.4, but maybe I can write it as fractions. 60/25 is 12/5, so 12w/(5x) gallons per minute.

So y / (60w/(25x)) = y * (25x)/(60w) = (25xy)/(60w). Simplify 25/60: divide numerator and denominator by 5, becomes 5/12. So (5xy)/(12w), which matches option C. Okay, I'm confident now.\n",

Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the rate is given as w/25 gallons every x seconds. Wait, so that's the amount of liquid passing per x seconds. So, to find the rate in gallons per second, I can think of it as (w/25) gallons divided by x seconds. So the rate R is R = (w/25) / x gallons per second.

The question says the liquid flows at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. And we need to find out how many minutes it takes for y gallons to pass through.\n\nAlright, so the first thing I should do is figure out the rate at which the liquid is flowing. Rate is usually measured in gallons per second or something like that. Right now, the rate is given as w/25 gallons every x seconds. So, the rate in gallons per second would be (w/25) divided by x. Let me write that down: rate = (w/25) / x. Which simplifies to w/(25x) gallons per second.\n\nWait, no, wait. No, wait. Wait, if it's w/25 gallons in x seconds, then the rate is (w/25) divided by x, which is (w)/(25x) gallons per second. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nBut we need to find the time it takes for y gallons to flow. So, time is equal to amount divided by rate. So, time in seconds would be y divided by (w/(25x)). Let me compute that: y / (w/(25x)) = y * (25x/w) = (25x y)/w seconds.\n\nBut the question asks for the time in minutes. So I need to convert seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so I divide the time in seconds by 60. So time in minutes is (25xy/w) /60. Let me calculate that: (25xy) / (60w) = (5xy)/(12w) minutes. Because 25 divided by 60 is 5/12, right? Because 25*5 is 125, wait wait, no. Wait, 25 divided by 60 is 5/12? Let me check: 25 divided by 60 equals 5/12. Because 5 times 5 is 25, and 12 times 5 is 60.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a liquid passing through a drain. Hmm, let me try to understand what's being asked. The question says the liquid flows at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. And we need to find out how many minutes it takes for y gallons to pass through.\n\nAlright, so the first thing I should do is figure out the rate at which the liquid is flowing. Rate is usually measured in gallons per second or something like that. Right now, the rate is given as w/25 gallons every x seconds. So, the rate in gallons per second would be (w/25) divided by x. Let me write that down: rate = (w/25) / x. Which simplifies to w/(25x) gallons per second.\n\nWait, no, wait. No, wait. Wait, if it's w/25 gallons in x seconds, then the rate is (w/25) divided by x, which is (w)/(25x) gallons per second. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nBut we need to find the time it takes for y gallons to flow. So, time is equal to amount divided by rate. So, time in seconds would be y divided by (w/(25x)). Let me compute that: y / (w/(25x)) = y * (25x/w) = (25x y)/w seconds.\n\nBut the question asks for the time in minutes. So I need to convert seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so I divide the time in seconds by 60. So time in minutes is (25xy/w) /60. Let me calculate that: (25xy) / (60w) = (5xy)/(12w) minutes. Because 25 divided by 60 is 5/12, right? Because 25*5 is 125, wait wait, no. Wait, 25 divided by 60 is 5/12? Let me check: 25 divided by 60 equals 5/12. Because 5 times 5 is 25, and 12 times 5 is 60. Yes, correct.\n\nSo the time is (5xy)/(12w) minutes. Now looking at the options, option C is 5xy/(12w). So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\n1. Rate is (w/25) gallons per x seconds. So rate R = (w/25)/x = w/(25x) g/s.\n\n2. Time in seconds to get y gallons: T = y / R = y / (w/(25x)) = y * (25x/w) = (25xy)/w seconds.\n\n3. Convert to minutes: T = (25xy/w) /60 = (25xy)/(60w) = (5xy)/(12w).\n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer is option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by determining the flow rate of the liquid. The liquid passes through the drain at a rate of \\( \\frac{w}{25} \\) gallons every \\( x \\) seconds.

So, the question is about a liquid passing through a drain at a certain rate, and we need to find out how long it takes for a specific amount of liquid to pass through.

The options are given, so I'll have to calculate the time and see which option matches.\n\nWait, okay, let's break it down. First, the rate is given as w/25 gallons per x seconds. So, the rate (I think) is (w/25) / x gallons per second. Because rate is amount over time. So, R = (w/25) / x. That's the same as w/(25x) gallons per second.\n\nBut we need to find the time in minutes, not seconds. Oh right, so maybe I should convert the rate into gallons per minute. Since 1 minute is 60 seconds, I can multiply the rate by 60 to get gallons per minute.\n\nSo, rate in gallons per minute would be (w/(25x)) * 60. Let me compute that. 60 divided by 25 is 2.4, so it's (2.4 * w)/x gallons per minute. Alternatively, 60/25 is 12/5, so 12w/(5x) gallons per minute. Wait, 60 divided by 25 is 2.4, yes, which is 12/5.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me compute it correctly. 60 divided by 25 is (60/25) = 12/5. So yes, the rate in gallons per minute is (w/(25x)) * 60 = (60w)/(25x) = (12w)/(5x) gallons per minute.\n\nBut wait, actually, rate is amount per time, so the initial rate is (w/25) gallons every x seconds. So, in terms of per second, it's (w/25) / x = w/(25x) gallons per second.

Because 1 minute is 60 seconds, so if I multiply the rate per second by 60, I get gallons per minute.\n\nSo, rate per minute would be (w)/(25x) * 60. Let me calculate that: 60 divided by (25x) times w. 60/25 is 2.4, so 2.4w/(x). Hmm, wait, 60/25 is 12*5, so 60/25 = 12* (5/25)=12*(1/5)=12/5=2.4. So yeah, 2.4w/x gallons per minute.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to write it as (60w)/(25x) which simplifies to (12w)/(5x) gallons per minute. Alternatively, 12w/(5x) is the same as 2.4w/x.\n\nSo the rate is 12w/(5x) gallons per minute. Got it.\n\nNow, the question is how long does it take to pass y gallons? So time is equal to amount divided by rate. So time = y / (rate) in minutes.\n\nSo substituting the rate, time = y / (12w/(5x)). Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so that becomes y * (5x)/(12w).\n\nSo time = (5xy)/(12w) minutes. Wait, let me double-check that. Let me write it out: y divided by (12w/(5x)) equals y multiplied by (5x)/(12w). So yes, that's 5xy/(12w).\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 5xy/(12w). So that's the one.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through the steps again.\n\nThe initial rate is w/25 gallons per x seconds. So per second, it's (w/25)/x = w/(25x) gallons per second. To get per minute, multiply by 60: 60 * w/(25x) = (60w)/(25x). Simplify 60/25 to 12/5, so 12w/(5x) gallons per minute.\n\nTime = amount / rate = y / (12w/(5x)) = y * (5x)/(12w) = (5xy)/(12w). Yep, that's correct.\n\n\nTo determine how many minutes it takes for \\( y \\) gallons to pass through the drain, we start with the given rate: the liquid flows at \\( \\frac{w}{25} \\) gallons every \\( x \\) seconds. First, convert this rate to gallons per second:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Rate per second} = \\frac{\\frac{w}{25}}{x} = \\frac{w}{25x}.\n\\]\n\nNext, convert this rate to gallons per minute by multiplying by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Rate per minute} = \\frac{w}{25x} \\times 60 = \\frac{60w}{25x}.\n\\]\n\nSimplify \\( \\frac{60}{25} \\) to \\( \\frac{12}{5} \\), so the rate becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Rate per minute} = \\frac{12w}{5x}.\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate the time required for \\( y \\) gallons to pass through the drain. Time is equal to the amount divided by the rate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time (minutes)} = \\frac{y}{\\frac{12w}{5x}}.\n\\]\n\nDividing by a fraction is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time (minutes)} = y \\times \\frac{5x}{12w} = \\frac{5xy}{12w}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the time it takes for \\( y \\) gallons to pass through the drain is \\( \\frac{5xy}{12w} \\) minutes. Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:\n\n**C) \\( \\frac{5xy}{12w} \\)**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a liquid passing through a drain. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking how many minutes it takes for y gallons to pass through the drain at a given rate. The rate is w/25 gallons every x seconds. I'm a bit confused, but I think I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the rate at which the liquid is flowing. The rate is given as w/25 gallons per x seconds. So, I guess that's the flow rate. Flow rate is usually volume over time. So the rate (let's call it R) is (w/25) gallons per x seconds. Wait, so R = (w/25) / x? Or is it (w/25) per x seconds? Oh right, because it's w/25 gallons every x seconds. So R = (w/25) / x, which simplifies to w/(25x) gallons per second.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I should think of it as R = (w/25) gallons per x seconds. So to get gallons per second, I divide by x. So R = (w/25) / x = w/(25x) gallons per second. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the time in minutes when y gallons have passed. So I need to find time t in minutes such that the volume y is equal to the rate multiplied by time, but I need to make sure the units are consistent.\n\nSo, the formula is volume = rate \u00d7 time. So y = R \u00d7 t. But wait, R is in gallons per second, and I need t in minutes. So maybe it's better to convert the rate to gallons per minute first.\n\nLet me think. Since 1 minute is 60 seconds, R in gallons per minute would be R = (w/(25x)) * 60. Because to convert per second to per minute, I multiply by 60. So R = (60w)/(25x) = (12w)/(5x) gallons per minute.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me double-check. If I have a rate of w/(25x) gallons per second, then in one minute (60 seconds), the volume is w/(25x) * 60. So yeah, that's (60w)/(25x) = (12w)/(5x) gallons per minute. So the rate is 12w/(5x) gallons per minute.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this using unit conversions. Let me try that.\n\nThe rate is (w/25) gallons every x seconds. So to find how many gallons per minute, I can set up a proportion. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so how many x-second intervals are there in a minute? It's 60/x intervals. Each interval contributes w/25 gallons. So the total per minute is (w/25) * (60/x) = (60w)/(25x) = (12w)/(5x) gallons per minute. Yep, same as before.\n\nSo now, I have the flow rate as 12w/(5x) gallons per minute. I need to find the time t (in minutes) when y gallons have passed. So the equation is y = (12w/(5x)) * t.\n\nI need to solve for t. So t = y / (12w/(5x)) ). Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so t = y * (5x)/(12w) = (5xy)/(12w) minutes.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 5xy/(12w), which matches. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the unit conversions. So, the initial rate is w/25 gallons every x seconds. So in x seconds, it's w/25 gallons. So per second, that's (w/25)/x = w/(25x) gallons/sec.\n\nTo get gallons per minute, multiply by 60: (w/(25x)) *60 = 60w/(25x) = (12w)/(5x) gallons per minute. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo then, time t = y / (12w/(5x)) ) = y * (5x)/(12w) )= (5xy)/(12w). So yes, option C is correct.\n",
