      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem about the shopkeeper and the servant's salary. Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nThe problem says a shopkeeper employed a servant with a monthly salary of 1500 rupees. Additionally, the shopkeeper agreed to pay the servant a commission of 15% on the monthly sales. The question is, how much sale in rupees should the servant make so that his monthly income is 6000 rupees? The options are given, and I need to pick the right one.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. The servant's total income has two parts: his fixed salary and the commission from sales. His fixed salary is 1500, and he gets 15% of the sales as commission. He wants his total income to be 6000.\n\nSo, the equation would be:\n\nTotal Income = Fixed Salary + Commission\n\nThe commission is 15% of the sales, so if I let S be the sales, then commission is 0.15 * S.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n6000 = 1500 + 0.15 * S\n\nI can rearrange this to solve for S. Subtract 1500 from both sides:\n\n6000 - 1500 = 0.15 * S\n\nThat's 4500 = 0.15 * S\n\nNow, to find S, I divide both sides by 0.15.\n\nSo, S = 4500 / 0.15\n\nLet me calculate that. 4500 divided by 0.15. Hmm, 0.15 is the same as 15/100. So dividing by 15/100 is the same as multiplying by 100/15.\n\nSo 4500 * (100/15) = ?\n\nWait, 4500 divided by 15 is 300. Because 15 times 300 is 4500. Then, 300 times 100 is 30,000. So S equals 30,000?\n\nWait, but let me double-check that division. 0.15 times 30,000 equals 4500. Yes, because 30,000 * 0.15 is 4500. Then adding the 1500 salary gives 6000. That makes sense.\n\nSo the required sales are 30,000 rupees. Looking at the options, option A is 30000. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Because sometimes when you're dealing with percentages, it's easy to mix up the numbers.\n\nSo, 15% of S is 0.15S. Adding the fixed 1500 gives 6000. So 0.15S = 4500. Then S = 4500 / 0.15.\n\nCalculating 4500 divided by 0.15: 4500 / 0.15 is the same as (4500 * 100) / 15. Let's compute that. 4500 times 100 is 450000. Divided by 15, 450000 /15 is 30,000. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the correct answer is 30,000, which is option A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe servant's total monthly income is the sum of a fixed salary and a commission based on sales. The fixed salary is \u20b91,500, and the commission is 15% of the sales (denoted as \\( S \\)). The total income is given as \u20b96,000.

Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the servant's total income is the sum of his salary and the commission. So, 6000 = salary + commission. The salary is fixed at 1500, so the commission must make up the rest. Let me subtract the salary from the total desired income: 6000 - 1500 equals 4500.

We need to find out how much sale he needs to make to achieve that.\n\nHmm, so I think the total income is the sum of the fixed salary and the commission from sales. The commission is 15% of the sales. So, if I let the sales amount be 'S', then the commission would be 15% of S, which is 0.15 * S.\n\nThe total income is 1500 (salary) plus 0.15*S (commission).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe shopkeeper employs a servant with a monthly salary of 1500 rupees. Plus, there's a commission of 15% on the monthly sales. The servant wants his monthly income to be 6000 rupees. I need to find out what the sale amount should be for that to happen. The options are given, but I'll try to solve it first.\n\nHmm, so the servant's total income is made up of two parts: his fixed salary and the commission from sales. The fixed part is 1500, and the commission is 15% of the sales. He wants the total to be 6000. So I think I can set up an equation for that.\n\nLet me denote the sale amount as S. Then, the commission would be 15% of S, which is 0.15 * S. His total income is 1500 plus 0.15S. And that should equal 6000.\n\nSo the equation is:\n1500 + 0.15S = 6000\n\nI can solve for S. Subtract 1500 from both sides to get the commission part by itself.\n\n0.15S = 6000 - 1500\n0.15S = 4500\n\nNow, to find S, I divide both sides by 0.15.\n\nS = 4500 / 0.15\n\nLet me calculate that. Hmm, 4500 divided by 0.15. Well, 0.15 is the same as 15/100, so dividing by 0.15 is the same as multiplying by 100/15. Let's see:\n\n4500 * (100/15) = ?\n\nWait, 4500 divided by 15 is 300. Because 15 times 300 is 4500. Then, multiply by 100, so that's 300 * 100 = 30,000. So S is 30,000 rupees.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 30000, so that's the answer.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe shopkeeper employs a servant with a monthly salary of 1500 rupees. Plus, there's a commission of 15% on the monthly sales. The servant wants his monthly income to be 6000 rupees. I need to find out what the sale amount should be for that to happen. The options are given, but I'll try to solve it first.\n\nHmm, so the servant's total income is made up of two parts: his fixed salary and the commission from sales. The fixed part is 1500, and the commission is 15% of the sales. He wants the total to be 6000. So I think I can set up an equation for that.\n\nLet me denote the sale amount as S. Then, the commission would be 15% of S, which is 0.15 * S. His total income is 1500 plus 0.15S. And that should equal 6000.\n\nSo the equation is:\n1500 + 0.15S = 6000\n\nI can solve for S. Subtract 1500 from both sides to get the commission part by itself.\n\n0.15S = 6000 - 1500\n0.15S = 4500\n\nNow, to find S, I divide both sides by 0.15.\n\nS = 4500 / 0.15\n\nLet me calculate that. Hmm, 4500 divided by 0.15. Well, 0.15 is the same as 15/100, so dividing by 0.15 is the same as multiplying by 100/15. Let's see:\n\n4500 * (100/15) = ?\n\nWait, 4500 divided by 15 is 300. Because 15 times 300 is 4500. Then, multiply by 100, so that's 300 * 100 = 30,000. So S is 30,000 rupees.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 30000, so that's the answer. But wait, let me check the options again. Oh, option C is 31500. Hmm, did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me try again. 4500 divided by 0.15. So 0.15 times 30,000 is 4500. That's correct. So 30,000 is the right sale amount. So the correct option is A.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. If the sale is 30,000, the commission is 15% of that, which is 4500.

The servant wants his monthly income to be 6000 rupees. The question is, how much sale in rupees does the servant need to make to achieve that?\n\nHmm, okay. So the servant has a fixed salary and a variable commission based on sales. His total desired income is 6000. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the fixed salary is 1500. So that's part of his income. The rest must come from the commission. So the commission he earns must be 6000 minus 1500, right? Let me calculate that.\n\n6000 minus 1500 is 4500. So the commission needs to be 4500.\n\nWait, the commission is 15% of the sales. So 15% of the sales equals 4500. Hmm, I think I can set up an equation for that.\n\nLet me denote the sales amount as S. So 15% of S is 0.15 * S. And that equals 4500.\n\nSo 0.15 * S = 4500. To find S, I can divide both sides by 0.15.\n\nS = 4500 / 0.15. Let me do that calculation. 4500 divided by 0.15. Hmm, 0.15 is the same as 15/100, so dividing by 0.15 is the same as multiplying by 100/15.\n\nSo 4500 * (100/15) = ?\n\nWait, 4500 divided by 15 is 300. Because 15 * 300 is 4500. Then 300 multiplied by 100 is 30,000. So S is 30,000.\n\nWait, wait. So the sales need to be 30,000 rupees for the commission to be 4500, which when added to the 1500 salary gives 6000.

Let me write the equation again.\n\nTotal Income = Fixed Salary + Commission\n6000 = 1500 + 0.15 * S\n\nSubtract 1500 from both sides: 4500 = 0.15 S\nDivide both sides by 0.15: S = 4500 / 0.15\nWhich is indeed 30000.\n\nSo the correct option is A) 30000. But wait, looking at the options, option C is 31500. Could I have made a mistake in the calculation?\n\nWait, no, 4500 divided by 0.15 is definitely 30,000. Because 0.15 times 30,000 is 4500.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe problem says: A shopkeeper employed a servant with a monthly salary of 1500 rupees. Additionally, the shopkeeper agreed to pay him a commission of 15% on the monthly sales. The question is, how much sale in rupees should the servant do to have a monthly income of 6000 rupees? The options are A)30000, B)415000, C)31500, D)50000, E)None of these.\n\nHmm. So the servant's total income comes from two parts: his fixed salary and the commission from sales. The fixed part is 1500 rupees, and the commission is 15% of the sales. The total desired income is 6000. So I need to find the sales amount that, when 15% is added to the salary, equals 6000.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's denote the sales as S. The commission would be 15% of S, which is 0.15 * S. The total income is then 1500 (salary) + 0.15 * S (commission) = 6000.\n\nSo the equation is: 1500 + 0.15S = 6000.\n\nI need to solve for S. Let's subtract 1500 from both sides to isolate the commission part.\n\n0.15S = 6000 - 1500.\n\n6000 minus 1500 is 4500. So 0.15S = 4500.\n\nNow, to find S, I'll divide both sides by 0.15.\n\nS = 4500 / 0.15.\n\nLet me calculate that. 4500 divided by 0.15. Hmm, 0.15 times 30,000 is 4500 because 0.15 * 30,000 = 4500. So S must be 30,000.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because 0.15 * 30,000 is indeed 4500. Adding that to the salary of 1500 gives 6000. So the sales should be 30,000 rupees.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 30,000. So the correct answer should be A.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Another way to think about it: The servant needs 6000. He already gets 1500, so he needs an additional 4500 from commission. Since the commission is 15%, 4500 is 15% of sales. So 15% equals 4500, so 100% is (4500 * 100)/15 = 30,000. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer is A)30000.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe servant's total monthly income is composed of a fixed salary of 1500 rupees and a 15% commission on sales. To achieve a total income of 6000 rupees, the commission required is 6000 - 1500 = 4500 rupees.
