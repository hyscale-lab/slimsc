      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about some friends going on a picnic. Let me read it carefully. The problem says that a group of friends planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. But then, four of them didn't show up. Because of that, the ones who did attend had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each. I need to find out how many attended the picnic. The options are A)8, B)12, C)16, D)24, E)25.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. So, originally, let's say the number of friends was N. They were each supposed to contribute a certain amount, right? So the total expense is 96 rupees. If all N friends were present, each would pay 96 divided by N.\n\nBut four didn't come, so the number of attendees became N - 4. Now, each of these remaining friends had to pay Rs.4 more than originally planned. So, the new amount each pays is (96 / N) + 4. But wait, the total expense is still 96, right? Because the total money they have is fixed. So the total after four didn't come would be (N - 4) multiplied by the new per-person amount, which equals 96.\n\nWait, maybe another way to think about it. Let me set up an equation. The original contribution per person is 96/N. After four didn't come, each contributes 4 more, so (96/N) +4. But the number of people is now N-4, so:\n\n(N -4) * [(96/N) +4] =96\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to think about the extra amount collected. Since each of the remaining people paid 4 more, the total extra is 4*(N-4) because each contributes 4 more. But wait, where did that extra go? Because the total expense is the same, 96. So the extra per person must compensate for the absence of the four friends.\n\nWait, maybe that's not the right approach. Let me think again. Initially, each person was supposed to pay 96/N. When four didn't come, the remaining N-4 have to cover the same 96, so each has to pay more. So the new per-person payment is 96/(N-4). And this new amount is Rs.4 more than the original per-person amount. So:\n\n96/(N-4) = (96/N) +4\n\nYes, that makes sense. So I can set up the equation like that. Let's write that down:\n\n96/(N-4) = (96/N) +4\n\nNow, I need to solve for N. Let's rearrange this equation.\n\nFirst, subtract (96/N) from both sides:\n\n96/(N-4) - 96/N =4\n\nFactor out 96:\n\n96 [1/(N-4) - 1/N] =4\n\nCompute the expression inside the brackets:\n\n1/(N-4) -1/N = [N - (N-4)] / [N(N-4)] = [4] / [N(N-4)]\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\n96 * [4 / (N(N-4))] =4\n\nSimplify:\n\n(96 *4)/(N(N-4)) )=4\n\nMultiply both sides by (N(N-4)):\n\n96*4 =4*N(N-4)\n\nSimplify 96*4: that's 384.\n\nSo,\n\n384 =4N(N-4)\n\nDivide both sides by4:\n\n96 =N(N-4)\n\nSo now, we have a quadratic equation:\n\nN^2 -4N -96=0\n\nLet me solve this quadratic equation. The standard form is ax\u00b2 +bx +c=0. So a=1, b=-4, c=-96.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nN = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 384)] /2\n\nBecause sqrt(16 +384) = sqrt(400) =20.\n\nSo,\n\nN = [4 +20]/2 =24/2=12\n\nOr N = [4-20]/2= (-16)/2= -8\n\nBut the number of people can't be negative, so N=12.\n\nSo the original number of friends was 12. But the question is asking for the number who attended. Since four didn't come, the attendees are 12-4=8. Wait, that's option A)8.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If N=12, the original per-person payment was 96/12=8. When four didn't come, attendees were 8, so each paid 96/8=12. Which is indeed 4 more than the original 8. So that makes sense.\n\nSo the number of attendees is 8, which is option A.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about some friends going on a picnic. Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nSo, the problem says that a number of friends planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. But then, four of them didn't turn up. Because of that, the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each. I need to find out how many attended the picnic.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. Let's say the original number of friends was N. They were supposed to split the Rs. 96 equally. So each would pay 96/N.\n\nBut four didn't come, so the number of attendees is N-4. Now, each of these N-4 friends has to pay more. How much more? Rs. 4 each. So the new amount each pays is (96/N) + 4.\n\nWait, no, maybe I should think about it differently. The total cost is still Rs. 96, but now there are fewer people to split it. So each person ends up paying more. Let's set up an equation.\n\nLet me denote the number of people who attended as x. So x = N - 4. Because four didn't come.\n\nOriginally, each was supposed to pay 96/N. Now, each pays 96/x. The difference between these two is 4. So:\n\n96/x - 96/N = 4.\n\nBut since x is N-4, I can write:\n\n96/(N-4) - 96/N = 4.\n\nHmm, that's a bit complicated. Maybe I can simplify it. Let's compute 96/(N-4) - 96/N.\n\nLet me find a common denominator. The common denominator would be N*(N-4). So:\n\n[96*N - 96*(N-4)] / [N*(N-4)] = 4.\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n96N - 96N + 96*4 = 96*4.\n\nSo the numerator is 384. So:\n\n384 / [N*(N-4)] = 4.\n\nMultiply both sides by N*(N-4):\n\n384 = 4 * N*(N-4).\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n96 = N*(N-4).\n\nSo, N\u00b2 -4N -96 = 0.\n\nWait, that's a quadratic equation. Let's solve for N.\n\nThe quadratic is N\u00b2 -4N -96 = 0.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, N = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 384)] / 2.\n\nBecause sqrt(16 + 384) = sqrt(400) = 20.\n\nSo, N = [4 +20]/2 = 24/2=12, or N= [4-20]/2= -16/2=-8.\n\nSince N can't be negative, N=12.\n\nSo the original number of friends was 12. But four didn't come, so the number who attended is 12-4=8.\n\nWait, but let me check the options. The options are A)8, B)12, etc. So the number of attendees is 8, which is option A.\n\nWait, wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up N and x. Because in the problem, the question is asking for the number of those who attended. So if N was 12, and four didn't come, attendees are 8. So the answer is 8, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my equations. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nAnother approach: Let the number of attendees be x. The original number was x +4.\n\nEach was supposed to pay 96/(x+4). Now, each pays 96/x.\n\nThe difference is 4, so:\n\n96/x - 96/(x+4) =4.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n96/x -96/(x+4) =4.\n\nFactor 96:\n\n96 [1/x -1/(x+4)] =4.\n\nSo,\n\n96 [ (x+4 -x ) / (x(x+4)) ) ] =4.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n96 [4 / (x\u00b2 +4x) ] =4.\n\nMultiply 96 and 4:\n\n384 / (x\u00b2 +4x) =4.\n\nMultiply both sides by (x\u00b2 +4x):\n\n384 =4(x\u00b2 +4x).\n\nDivide both sides by4:\n\n96 =x\u00b2 +4x.\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2 +4x -96=0.\n\nWait, this is a different quadratic. Let's solve it.\n\nx\u00b2 +4x -96 =0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\nx = [-4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 384)] / 2.\n\nsqrt(400)=20.\n\nSo,\n\nx= (-4+20)/2=16/2=8, or x=(-4-20)/2=-24/2=-12.\n\nBut x can't be negative, so x=8.\n\nSo, the number of attendees is 8, which is option A.\n\nYes, that's consistent.

The options are A)8, B)12, etc. So the number of attendees is 8, which is option A.\n\nWait, wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up N and x. Because in the problem, the question is asking for the number of those who attended. So if N was 12, and four didn't come, attendees are 8. So the answer is 8, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my equations. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nAnother approach: Let the number of attendees be x. The original number was x +4.\n\nEach was supposed to pay 96/(x+4). Now, each pays 96/x.\n\nThe difference is 4, so:\n\n96/x - 96/(x+4) =4.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n96/x -96/(x+4) =4.\n\nFactor 96:\n\n96 [1/x -1/(x+4)] =4.\n\nSo,\n\n96 [ (x+4 -x ) / (x(x+4)) ) ] =4.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n96 [4 / (x\u00b2 +4x) ] =4.\n\nMultiply 96 and 4:\n\n384 / (x\u00b2 +4x) =4.\n\nMultiply both sides by (x\u00b2 +4x):\n\n384 =4(x\u00b2 +4x).\n\nDivide both sides by4:\n\n96 =x\u00b2 +4x.\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2 +4x -96=0.\n\nWait, this is a different quadratic. Let's solve it.\n\nx\u00b2 +4x -96 =0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\nx = [-4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 384)] / 2.\n\nsqrt(400)=20.\n\nSo,\n\nx= (-4+20)/2=16/2=8, or x=(-4-20)/2=-24/2=-12.\n\nBut x can't be negative, so x=8.\n\nSo, the number of attendees is 8, which is option A.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So the correct answer is A)8.\n\n\nLet the original number of friends be \\( N \\). They planned to split Rs. 96 equally, so each was supposed to pay \\( \\frac{96}{N} \\). However, four friends did not attend, leaving \\( N - 4 \\) attendees. As a result, each attendee had to pay \\( \\frac{96}{N - 4} \\), which was Rs. 4 more than the original share. This gives the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{96}{N - 4} - \\frac{96}{N} = 4.\n\\]\n\nSimplify the equation by finding a common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{96N - 96(N - 4)}{N(N - 4)} = 4.\n\\]\n\nThe numerator simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n96N - 96N + 384 = 384.\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{384}{N(N - 4)} = 4.\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( N(N - 4) \\):\n\n\\[\n384 = 4N(N - 4).\n\\]\n\nDivide by 4:\n\n\\[\n96 = N(N - 4).\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\nN^2 - 4N - 96 = 0.\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\( N \\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nN = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 384}}{2} = \\frac{-4 \\pm 20}{2}.\n\\]\n\nThe positive root is:\n\n\\[\nN = \\frac{16}{2} = 12.\n\\]\n\nThus, the original number of friends was 12. Since four did not attend, the number of attendees is:\n\n\\[\nN - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8.\n\\]\n\nTo confirm, let the number of attendees be \\( x \\). The original number of friends is \\( x + 4 \\). Each attendee pays \\( \\frac{96}{x} \\), which is Rs. 4 more than the original share \\( \\frac{96}{x + 4} \\). This gives:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{96}{x} - \\frac{96}{x + 4} = 4.\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n96 \\left( \\frac{1}{x} - \\frac{1}{x + 4} \\right) = 4.\n\\]\n\nThe numerator becomes:\n\n\\[\n96 \\left( \\frac{4}{x(x + 4)} \\right) = 4.\n\\]\n\nMultiply through:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{384}{x^2 + 4x} = 4.\n\\]\n\nMultiply by \\( x^2 + 4x \\):\n\n\\[\n384 = 4(x^2 + 4x).\n\\]\n\nDivide by 4:\n\n\\[\n96 = x^2 + 4x.\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 4x - 96 = 0.\n\\]\n\nSolve using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 384}}{2} = \\frac{-4 \\pm 20}{2}.\n\\]\n\nThe positive root is:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{16}{2} = 8.\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of attendees is 8, which corresponds to option **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",

They initially planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. But then, four of them didn't turn up. Because of that, the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each. The question is asking how many of them attended the picnic.\n\nHmm, so I think I need to find the number of friends who actually went. The options are A)8, B)12, C)16, D)24, E)25.\n\nLet me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, let's denote the number of friends who attended as x.

So the original number of friends is x + 4? No, wait, perhaps I should think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the original number of friends is N, and N -4 attended. Because four didn't turn up. So the number of attendees is N -4. But I don't know N, so maybe I should express it in terms of variables.\n\nLet me try to model this.\n\nLet's say the original number of friends planning to attend is N. But four didn't come, so the number of attendees is N -4.\n\nThe total cost is Rs. 96. So, initially, each person was supposed to contribute 96/N. But since four didn't come, each of the remaining (N-4) had to pay extra Rs.4.\n\nSo, the new contribution per person is (96/N) +4.\n\nBut wait, no.

Each was to contribute 96/12=8 Rs.\n\nBut four didn't come, so 8 people attended. Each had to contribute 96/8=12 Rs.\n\nSo each paid 4 Rs extra (12-8=4). That matches the problem statement.

So the new amount each pays is (96/N) + 4.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that the total amount is still 96, but now it's being split among N-4 people. So each person's share is 96/(N-4). And this amount is 4 rupees more than the original share. So the original share was 96/N, and now it's 96/(N-4) = (96/N) + 4.\n\nSo I can set up the equation: 96/(N-4) = (96/N) +4.\n\nHmm, okay, let me write that equation down properly.\n\n96/(N -4) = 96/N +4\n\nI need to solve for N. Let's see. Maybe I can subtract 96/N from both sides to get:\n\n96/(N-4) - 96/N =4\n\nFactor out 96:\n\n96 [1/(N-4) - 1/N ] =4\n\nCompute the difference in the brackets: 1/(N-4) - 1/N = [N - (N-4)] / [N(N-4)] = [4] / [N(N-4)]\n\nSo substituting back:\n\n96 * [4/(N(N-4))] =4\n\nSo 96*4 / [N(N-4)] =4\n\nMultiply both sides by [N(N-4)]:\n\n96*4 =4 * N(N-4)\n\nSimplify both sides. Divide both sides by 4:\n\n96 = N(N-4)\n\nSo N^2 -4N -96 =0\n\nWait, that's a quadratic equation. Let me solve for N.\n\nThe equation is N^2 -4N -96 =0.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula: N = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 384)] /2\n\nBecause sqrt(16 + 384) = sqrt(400) =20.\n\nSo N = [4 +20]/2 =24/2=12, or [4-20]/2= -16/2=-8.\n\nSince the number of people can't be negative, N=12.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the number of those who attended. Oh right, because four didn't come. So attendees are N-4 =12-4=8.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 8, option B is 12. So the answer should be 8, which is option A.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nOriginal equation: 96/(N-4) =96/N +4.\n\nAfter moving terms, I got 96/(N-4) -96/N =4.\n\nFactored 96 out and found the difference in fractions, which led to 4/(N(N-4)).\n\nSo 96*(4/(N(N-4))) =4 \u2192 384/(N(N-4))=4 \u2192 384=4N(N-4) \u2192 96= N(N-4). That's correct.\n\nSo N^2 -4N -96=0 \u2192 discriminant 16 + 384=400 \u2192 sqrt(400)=20 \u2192 N=(4+20)/2=12. So original number was 12, attendees 8. So the answer is 8, which is option A.\n\n\nThe total amount planned for the picnic was Rs. 96. Let the original number of friends be \\( N \\). If all \\( N \\) attended, each would contribute \\( \\frac{96}{N} \\) rupees. However, four friends did not attend, leaving \\( N - 4 \\) friends to share the cost. As a result, each of the remaining friends paid Rs. 4 extra, making their contribution \\( \\frac{96}{N} + 4 \\).\n\nThe total cost can also be expressed as \\( \\frac{96}{N - 4} \\) since it is now being shared among \\( N - 4 \\) friends. Equating the two expressions for the contribution per person:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{96}{N - 4} = \\frac{96}{N} + 4\n\\]\n\nSubtracting \\( \\frac{96}{N} \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{96}{N - 4} - \\frac{96}{N} = 4\n\\]\n\nFactoring out 96:\n\n\\[\n96 \\left( \\frac{1}{N - 4} - \\frac{1}{N} \\right) = 4\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the difference in fractions:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{N - 4} - \\frac{1}{N} = \\frac{N - (N - 4)}{N(N - 4)} = \\frac{4}{N(N - 4)}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting back:\n\n\\[\n96 \\cdot \\frac{4}{N(N - 4)} = 4\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{384}{N(N - 4)} = 4\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\( N(N - 4) \\):\n\n\\[\n384 = 4N(N - 4)\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 4:\n\n\\[\n96 = N(N - 4)\n\\]\n\nExpanding and rearranging:\n\n\\[\nN^2 - 4N - 96 = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving the quadratic equation \\( N^2 - 4N - 96 = 0 \\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nN = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), and \\( c = -96 \\).

Hmm, let's see what the question says.\n\nSo, a group of friends planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables for their picnic. But then, four of them didn't show up. Because of that, the remaining friends each had to contribute Rs. 4 more than they originally planned. The question is asking how many of them actually attended the picnic. The options are A)8, B)12, C)16, D)24, E)25.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I think I'll need to set up some variables to model the situation. Let's say the original number of friends who were going to attend the picnic is N. So, the total amount they planned to spend is Rs. 96. Each person was supposed to contribute an equal share. So, the original share per person would be 96 divided by N, right? So, original share = 96/N.\n\nBut then, four people didn't come. So, the number of people who actually attended is N - 4. Now, because four people are missing, the remaining N - 4 people have to cover the entire Rs. 96 themselves. So, the new share per person becomes 96 divided by (N - 4). \n\nWait, the problem states that because of the four not coming, each of the remaining had to contribute Rs. 4 extra. So, the new share is Rs. 4 more than the original share. That gives me an equation. \n\nSo, the new share is original share plus 4. Let me write that down as an equation:\n\n96/(N - 4) = (96/N) + 4.\n\nHmm, that looks right. Now, I need to solve this equation for N. Let's see. I can rearrange this equation to find N.\n\nFirst, let's subtract (96/N) from both sides:\n\n96/(N - 4) - 96/N = 4.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor out 96 to make it easier. Let's factor 96:\n\n96 [ 1/(N -4) - 1/N ] = 4.\n\nSimplify the terms inside the brackets. The common denominator for (N -4) and N is N(N-4). So, let's compute 1/(N-4) minus 1/N:\n\n[ N - (N -4) ] / [N(N-4)] = [N - N +4]/[N(N-4)] = 4/[N(N-4)].\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n96 * [4/(N(N-4)))] = 4.\n\nMultiply that out:\n\n(96 * 4) / [N(N-4)] = 4.\n\n96 times 4 is 384. So,\n\n384 / [N(N-4)] = 4.\n\nNow, multiply both sides by [N(N-4)]:\n\n384 = 4 * N(N-4).\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n96 = N(N-4).\n\nSo, expanding that, we get:\n\nN\u00b2 -4N -96 = 0.\n\nNow, this is a quadratic equation. Let's try to solve it. The quadratic is N\u00b2 -4N -96 = 0.\n\nThe quadratic formula is N = [4 \u00b1 sqrt( ( -4 )\u00b2 -4*1*(-96) ) ]/(2*1).\n\nCompute the discriminant first:\n\n(-4)^2 is 16. 4*1*96 is 384. Since it's -4*1*(-96), it's +384. So, discriminant is 16 + 384 = 400.\n\nSo, sqrt(400) is 20.\n\nSo, N = [4 \u00b120]/2.\n\nWe have two solutions:\n\n(4 +20)/2 = 24/2 =12.\n\n(4-20)/2 = (-16)/2 = -8.\n\nBut since the number of friends can't be negative, we take N=12.\n\nWait, wait. Wait a second. So N was the original number of friends, right? But the question is asking how many attended. Because four didn't show up, the number who attended is N -4.\n\nSo, if N is 12, the number who attended is 12 -4=8.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, 8 is option A. So that's the answer? But wait, let me double-check because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in the setup.\n\nLet me test it. Let's say N=12. The original share would be 96/12=8 Rs per person. But four didn't come, so 8 people attended. The new share is 96/8=12 Rs. So each person now pays 12 Rs, which is 4 Rs more than the original 8 Rs. That matches the problem statement. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the number of attendees is 8, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, let me check the options again. The options are A)8, B)12, C)16, D)24, E)25. So 8 is the number of attendees, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up N and the attendees. Because in the problem, the number of people who attended is N-4. So if N is 12, the attendees are 8. So the answer is 8, which is option A.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But another way to approach this could be to test each option to see which fits.\n\nLet's try each option as the number of attendees (let's call it A), and see if it satisfies the condition.\n\nThe original number of people would be A +4, because four didn't come. The original share per person was 96/(A+4). The new share is 96/A. The difference should be 4 Rs.\n\nSo, let's test option A)8:\n\nOriginal number N = 8 +4 =12.\n\nOriginal share: 96/12=8.\n\nNew share: 96/8=12.\n\nDifference is 12-8=4. Yes, that works.\n\nSo option A is correct.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again carefully.\n\nThe problem says that a group of friends planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables for their picnic. But then, four of them didn't show up. Because of that, the remaining friends had to each contribute Rs. 4 extra. I need to find out how many attended the picnic.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. Let me denote the number of friends who attended as 'x'. Originally, the total number of friends was x + 4 because four didn't come.\n\nThe initial plan was that each person would contribute equally to the Rs. 96. So, the original contribution per person would be 96 divided by the total number of friends, which is 96/(x+4).\n\nBut when four didn't come, the number of attendees became x. So now, each person has to pay more. The new contribution per person is 96 divided by x, right? Because the total cost remains the same, but fewer people are sharing it.\n\nThe problem says that each person now pays Rs. 4 extra. So, the new contribution minus the original contribution equals 4. \n\nLet me write that as an equation:\n\n(96 / x) - (96 / (x + 4)) = 4\n\nOkay, now I need to solve this equation for x. Let's see how to do that.\n\nFirst, let's find a common denominator for the two fractions on the left. The denominators are x and x+4, so the common denominator is x(x+4). So, I'll rewrite both fractions:\n\n[96(x+4) - 96x] / [x(x+4)] = 4\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n96x + 384 -96x = 384\n\nSo now the equation is:\n\n384 / [x(x+4)] = 4\n\nMultiply both sides by x(x+4) to eliminate the denominator:\n\n384 = 4x(x + 4)\n\nDivide both sides by 4 to simplify:\n\n96 = x(x + 4)\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n96 = x\u00b2 + 4x\n\nNow, bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:\n\nx\u00b2 +4x -96 =0\n\nWait, I think I should double-check that. Wait, no, the equation was 384/(x(x+4))=4, which becomes 384 =4x(x+4). Dividing both sides by 4 gives 96 = x\u00b2 +4x. So, moving everything to left:\n\nx\u00b2 +4x -96 =0\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation. Let's see, perhaps using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is ax\u00b2 +bx +c =0. Here, a=1, b=4, c= -96.\n\nThe quadratic formula is x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nb\u00b2 is 16. 4ac is 4*1*(-96)= -384. So, the discriminant is 16 - (4*1*(-96)) = 16 + 384 = 400.\n\nSo sqrt(400)=20.\n\nThus,\n\nx = [-4 \u00b120 ]/(2*1)\n\nSo two possible solutions:\n\nx = (-4 +20)/2 = 16/2=8\n\nx = (-4 -20)/2 =-24/2=-12\n\nBut x can't be negative, so x=8.\n\nSo the number of attendees is 8. Looking at the options, option A is 8.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let's plug x=8 back into the original problem.\n\nOriginally, total friends were 8+4=12.\n\nEach was supposed to pay 96/12=8 Rs.\n\nBut when four didn't come, 8 people paid 96/8=12 Rs each.\n\nSo the difference is 12-8=4 Rs, which matches the condition. So yes, x=8 is correct. So the answer is A)8.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again carefully.\n\nThe problem says that a group of friends planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables for their picnic. But then, four of them didn't show up. Because of that, the remaining friends had to each contribute Rs. 4 extra. I need to find out how many attended the picnic.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. Let me denote the number of friends who attended as 'x'. Originally, the total number of friends was x + 4 because four didn't come.\n\nThe initial plan was that each person would contribute equally to the Rs. 96. So, the original contribution per person would be 96 divided by the total number of friends, which is 96/(x+4).\n\nBut when four didn't come, the number of attendees became x. So now, each person has to pay more. The new contribution per person is 96 divided by x, right? Because the total cost remains the same, but fewer people are sharing it.\n\nThe problem says that each person now pays Rs. 4 extra. So, the new contribution minus the original contribution equals 4. \n\nLet me write that as an equation:\n\n(96 / x) - (96 / (x + 4)) = 4\n\nOkay, now I need to solve this equation for x. Let's see how to do that.\n\nFirst, let's find a common denominator for the two fractions on the left. The denominators are x and x+4, so the common denominator is x(x+4). So, I'll rewrite both fractions:\n\n[96(x+4) - 96x] / [x(x+4)] = 4\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n96x + 384 -96x = 384\n\nSo now the equation is:\n\n384 / [x(x+4)] = 4\n\nMultiply both sides by x(x+4) to eliminate the denominator:\n\n384 = 4x(x + 4)\n\nDivide both sides by 4 to simplify:\n\n96 = x(x + 4)\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n96 = x\u00b2 + 4x\n\nNow, bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:\n\nx\u00b2 +4x -96 =0\n\nWait, I think I should double-check that. Wait, no, the equation was 384/(x(x+4))=4, which becomes 384 =4x(x+4). Dividing both sides by 4 gives 96 = x\u00b2 +4x.

Because of that, the remaining friends had to each contribute Rs. 4 extra. We need to find out how many friends attended the picnic.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me try to break this down. So, originally, they all intended to split the Rs. 96 equally. But when four people didn't come, the number of people sharing the cost decreased. That means each person now has to pay more\u2014specifically, Rs. 4 more than they originally planned.\n\nWait, so let me denote the number of friends who attended as x. But wait, actually, the original number of friends would be x plus 4, right? Because four didn't come. So, original number is x +4, and the number who attended is x.\n\nSo, the initial plan was for (x +4) people to split Rs. 96. So the cost per person originally would be 96 divided by (x +4). But because four people didn't come, the new number of people is x, and each person now has to pay 4 rupees more. So the new cost per person is (96/x), which is equal to the original cost per person plus 4.\n\nWait, let me write that as an equation. The original cost per person is 96/(x +4). The new cost is 96/x. And according to the problem, the new cost is 4 rupees more than the original. So:\n\n96/x = 96/(x +4) + 4\n\nHmm, okay, that makes sense. So now I need to solve for x.

Let me see if I can find two numbers that multiply to -96 and add to 4.\n\nHmm, factors of 96: 1 &96, 2&48, 3&32, 4&24, 6&16, 8&12.\n\nLooking for a pair that when one is positive and the other negative, their product is -96 and sum is 4.\n\nLet me see: 12 and -8. 12 * (-8) = -96, and 12 + (-8) =4.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says that a group of friends planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables for their picnic. But then, four of them didn't show up. Because of this, the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each. The question is asking how many people attended the picnic. The options are A)8, B)12, C)16, D)24, E)25.\n\nHmm, okay. So I think I need to set up some equations here. Let's think about the variables involved. Let's say the original number of friends planning to attend was N. Each was supposed to contribute a certain amount, right?\n\nSo the total cost is Rs. 96. So if all N friends were coming, each would pay 96 divided by N. So the original contribution per person is 96/N.\n\nBut then, four didn't come. So the number of people who actually attended is N - 4. Now, because four people didn't come, the remaining ones have to cover the same total cost, but with fewer people. So each of the remaining (N-4) people has to pay more. According to the problem, each ended up contributing Rs. 4 extra than they originally planned.\n\nSo the new contribution per person is the original amount plus 4. So that's (96/N) + 4.\n\nBut wait, that new contribution per person multiplied by the number of attendees (N-4) should equal the total cost, which is 96. So the equation would be:\n\n[(96/N) + 4] * (N - 4) = 96\n\nHmm, that makes sense. Let me write that equation out:\n\n( (96/N) + 4 ) * (N - 4) = 96\n\nI can try expanding this equation to solve for N.\n\nFirst, expand the left side:\n\n(96/N)(N - 4) + 4*(N -4) = 96\n\nLet's compute each part. The first term is 96/N multiplied by (N-4), which would be 96 - (384/N). Because (96/N)*N is 96, and (96/N)*(-4) is -384/N.\n\nThe second term is 4*(N-4) which is 4N -16.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n96 - (384/N) + 4N -16 = 96\n\nSimplify this equation:\n\nCombine the constants: 96 -16 = 80.\n\nSo now it's:\n\n80 - (384/N) +4N =96\n\nWait, subtract 96 from both sides:\n\n80 - (384/N) +4N -96 =0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-16 - (384/N) +4N =0\n\nLet me rearrange the terms:\n\n4N - (384/N) -16 =0\n\nHmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can multiply both sides by N to eliminate the denominator. Let's try that.\n\nMultiply every term by N:\n\n4N^2 - 384 -16N =0\n\nSo that's:\n\n4N^2 -16N -384 =0\n\nI can factor out a 4 from all terms:\n\n4(N^2 -4N -96) =0\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\nN^2 -4N -96 =0\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation: N^2 -4N -96 =0\n\nI can try to factor this. Let's look for two numbers that multiply to -96 and add to -4.\n\nHmm, factors of 96 are 1 &96, 2&48, 3&32, 4&24, 6&16, 8&12.\n\nLooking for a pair where one is positive and the other negative, such that their product is -96 and sum is -4.\n\nLet me see: 12 and -8? 12 * (-8) = -96, and 12 + (-8) =4. Oh wait, but the equation is N^2 -4N -96=0. So the middle term is -4N. So I think the factors would be (N -12)(N +8) =0 because:\n\n(N-12)(N+8) = N^2 +8N -12N -96 = N^2 -4N -96.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the solutions are N =12 or N= -8.\n\nSince the number of people can't be negative, N=12.\n\nSo originally, there were 12 friends. But four didn't come, so the number of attendees was 12-4=8.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the number of those who attended, so the answer would be 8, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me check if that makes sense.\n\nOriginal number of friends:12.\n\nEach was to pay 96/12 =8 Rs.\n\nFour didn't come, so 8 people attended.\n\nEach now pays 96/8=12 Rs.\n\nWhich is 4 Rs more than before.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says that a group of friends planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables for their picnic. But then, four of them didn't show up. Because of this, the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each. The question is asking how many people attended the picnic. The options are A)8, B)12, C)16, D)24, E)25.\n\nHmm, okay. So I think I need to set up some equations here. Let's think about the variables involved. Let's say the original number of friends planning to attend was N. Each was supposed to contribute a certain amount, right?\n\nSo the total cost is Rs. 96. So if all N friends were coming, each would pay 96 divided by N. So the original contribution per person is 96/N.\n\nBut then, four didn't come. So the number of people who actually attended is N - 4. Now, because four people didn't come, the remaining ones have to cover the same total cost, but with fewer people. So each of the remaining (N-4) people has to pay more. According to the problem, each ended up contributing Rs. 4 extra than they originally planned.\n\nSo the new contribution per person is the original amount plus 4. So that's (96/N) + 4.\n\nBut wait, that new contribution per person multiplied by the number of attendees (N-4) should equal the total cost, which is 96. So the equation would be:\n\n[(96/N) + 4] * (N - 4) = 96\n\nHmm, that makes sense. Let me write that equation out:\n\n( (96/N) + 4 ) * (N - 4) = 96\n\nI can try expanding this equation to solve for N.\n\nFirst, expand the left side:\n\n(96/N)(N - 4) + 4*(N -4) = 96\n\nLet's compute each part. The first term is 96/N multiplied by (N-4), which would be 96 - (384/N). Because (96/N)*N is 96, and (96/N)*(-4) is -384/N.\n\nThe second term is 4*(N-4) which is 4N -16.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n96 - (384/N) + 4N -16 = 96\n\nSimplify this equation:\n\nCombine the constants: 96 -16 = 80.\n\nSo now it's:\n\n80 - (384/N) +4N =96\n\nWait, subtract 96 from both sides:\n\n80 - (384/N) +4N -96 =0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-16 - (384/N) +4N =0\n\nLet me rearrange the terms:\n\n4N - (384/N) -16 =0\n\nHmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can multiply both sides by N to eliminate the denominator. Let's try that.\n\nMultiply every term by N:\n\n4N^2 - 384 -16N =0\n\nSo that's:\n\n4N^2 -16N -384 =0\n\nI can factor out a 4 from all terms:\n\n4(N^2 -4N -96) =0\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\nN^2 -4N -96 =0\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation: N^2 -4N -96 =0\n\nI can try to factor this. Let's look for two numbers that multiply to -96 and add to -4.\n\nHmm, factors of 96 are 1 &96, 2&48, 3&32, 4&24, 6&16, 8&12.\n\nLooking for a pair where one is positive and the other negative, such that their product is -96 and sum is -4.\n\nLet me see: 12 and -8? 12 * (-8) = -96, and 12 + (-8) =4. Oh wait, but the equation is N^2 -4N -96=0. So the middle term is -4N. So I think the factors would be (N -12)(N +8) =0 because:\n\n(N-12)(N+8) = N^2 +8N -12N -96 = N^2 -4N -96.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the solutions are N =12 or N= -8.\n\nSince the number of people can't be negative, N=12.\n\nSo originally, there were 12 friends. But four didn't come, so the number of attendees was 12-4=8.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the number of those who attended, so the answer would be 8, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me check if that makes sense.\n\nOriginal number of friends:12.\n\nEach was to pay 96/12 =8 Rs.\n\nFour didn't come, so 8 people attended.\n\nEach now pays 96/8=12 Rs.\n\nWhich is 4 Rs more than before. So yes, that matches the condition.\n\nSo the number of attendees is 8, which is option A.\n\nAlternatively, I could have set it up differently. Let me think: Let x be the number of attendees. Then, originally, the number of people was x +4.\n\nThe original contribution per person would be 96/(x+4). The new contribution is 96/x.\n\nAccording to the problem, the new contribution is 4 more than original.\n\nSo: 96/x = 96/(x+4) +4.\n\nLet me solve this equation.\n\nMultiply both sides by x(x+4) to eliminate denominators.\n\n96(x+4) =96x +4x(x+4)\n\nExpand:\n\n96x + 384 =96x +4x\u00b2 +16x\n\nSubtract 96x from both sides:\n\n384 =4x\u00b2 +16x\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n4x\u00b2 +16x -384=0\n\nDivide by 4:\n\nx\u00b2 +4x -96=0\n\nAgain, factor: looking for two numbers that multiply to -96 and add to +4.\n\n12 and -8: 12 * (-8)=-96, 12 + (-8)=4.

So I can set up the equation: 96/(n-4) = (96/n) + 4.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n96/(n - 4) = (96/n) + 4.\n\nHmm, I need to solve for n here. Let me rearrange this equation. First, I'll subtract 96/n from both sides to get:\n\n96/(n - 4) - 96/n = 4.\n\nTo combine the left side, I can factor out 96 and find a common denominator. The common denominator for (n-4) and n is n(n-4). So let's rewrite each term:\n\n96 * n / [n(n-4)] - 96*(n-4)/[n(n-4)] = 4.\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n[96n - 96(n -4)] / [n(n-4)] =4.\n\nExpanding the numerator:\n\n96n -96n + 384 = 384.\n\nSo the numerator is 384. So the equation becomes:\n\n384 / [n(n-4)] =4.\n\nMultiply both sides by [n(n-4)]:\n\n384 =4 * n(n-4).\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n96 =n(n-4).\n\nSo now we have the quadratic equation:\n\nn^2 -4n -96 =0.\n\nLet me solve this quadratic. The quadratic formula is n = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 384)] / 2. Because the equation is n\u00b2 -4n -96=0, so a=1, b=-4, c=-96.\n\nDiscriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac = (16) -4*(1)*(-96) =16 + 384 =400.\n\nSo sqrt(D)=20.\n\nThus, n = [4 \u00b120]/2.\n\nWe have two solutions: (4+20)/2=24/2=12, and (4-20)/2=-16/2=-8. Since the number of people can't be negative, we take n=12.\n\nSo the original number of friends was 12. But four didn't attend, so the number who attended is 12 -4=8.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, 8 is option A. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me check the calculations again. When n=12, each was supposed to pay 96/12=8. But four didn't come, so attendees are 8. Each now pays 96/8=12. So the extra per person is 12-8=4. Which matches the problem statement. So yes, the number who attended is 8, which is option A.\n\nWait, but wait another thing.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about friends going on a picnic and some money calculations. Hmm, let's see. The question says that a group of friends planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. But four of them didn't show up, so the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each. I need to find out how many attended the picnic. The options are A)8, B)12, C)16, D)24, E)25.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Let me think about what variables are involved here. There's the original number of friends who planned to go, and then four didn't come. So the number of attendees is the original number minus four. But I don't know the original number. Wait, maybe I can represent it with a variable.\n\nLet me denote the original number of friends as 'n'. So each friend was supposed to contribute a certain amount. The total expense is Rs.96, so each person's share would be 96 divided by n. So the original share per person is 96/n.\n\nBut since four friends didn't come, the number of attendees is n-4. Now, because of this, each of the remaining friends had to pay Rs.4 extra. So the new share per person is (96/n) + 4.\n\nBut wait, the new share can also be calculated based on the new number of attendees.

The quadratic formula is n = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 384)] / 2.

Let's see what it's about.\n\nThe problem says that a group of friends planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables for their picnic. But then, four of them didn't show up. Because of that, the remaining friends each had to contribute Rs. 4 extra. The question is asking how many people attended the picnic. The options are A)8, B)12, C)16, D)24, E)25.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. So originally, they were all going to split Rs.96 equally. But when four people didn't come, the cost per person went up by Rs.4 for each remaining person. I need to find out how many came.\n\nLet me denote the number of friends who attended as x. Then, the original number of friends must have been x + 4, because four didn't show up. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the original number is the total that planned, and four didn't come. So the original number is x + 4? Or is it that the original number is x, and four didn't come, so x-4 attended? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, the problem says \"four of them did not turn up.\" So the total number of friends who planned to go was x + 4, because x is the number who actually came, and four didn't. So the original number was x +4.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me set variables correctly. Let's say the original number of friends planning to go was N. Four didn't come, so the number who attended was N -4.\n\nWait, that's correct. So N is the total, and N-4 attended.\n\nThe initial plan was to spend Rs.96, so each was supposed to contribute 96/N. But because four didn't come, the remaining N-4 had to contribute more. The new contribution per person is 96/(N-4). And according to the problem, this new amount is Rs.4 more than the original per person share.\n\nSo the equation would be:\n\n96/(N-4) = (96/N) + 4\n\nHmm, that makes sense. Now I need to solve for N.\n\nLet me write that equation again:\n\n96/(N -4) = (96/N) + 4\n\nI can rearrange this to solve for N. Let's subtract 96/N from both sides:\n\n96/(N -4) - 96/N = 4\n\nFactor out 96:\n\n96 [1/(N-4) - 1/N] =4\n\nCompute the difference in the brackets:\n\n1/(N-4) -1/N = [N - (N-4)] / [N(N-4)] = [N - N +4] / [N(N-4)] = 4/[N(N-4)]\n\nSo substituting back:\n\n96 * [4/(N(N-4))] =4\n\nMultiply both sides by N(N-4):\n\n96 *4 =4 * N(N-4)\n\nSimplify 96*4: that's 384.\n\nSo 384 =4 N(N-4)\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n96 = N(N-4)\n\nSo N^2 -4N -96=0\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation. Let's compute the discriminant: b^2-4ac. Here, a=1, b=-4, c=-96.\n\nDiscriminant D = (-4)^2 -4*1*(-96) = 16 +384=400.\n\nSquare root of 400 is 20.\n\nSo N = [4 \u00b120]/2\n\nWe can discard the negative solution because N can't be negative. So:\n\n(4 +20)/2=24/2=12\n\nSo N=12. That's the original number of friends. But the question is asking for the number of those who attended, which is N-4=12-4=8.\n\nWait, so the number of attendees is 8? Looking at the options, option A is 8.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me plug N=12 into the original scenario.\n\nOriginal plan: 12 people, total 96. Each pays 96/12=8 Rs.\n\nBut four didn't come, so 8 people. Each pays 96/8=12 Rs.\n\nThe difference is 12-8=4 Rs per person, which matches the problem statement.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem. Let's read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nA group of friends planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables for their picnic. But four of them didn't show up. Because of that, the remaining friends had to each pay Rs. 4 more than originally planned. I need to find out how many attended the picnic.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. Let's assume the number of friends who were supposed to come is N. So the original plan was for N people to split Rs.96. Each person was going to pay 96/N rupees.\n\nBut four didn't come, so the number of attendees is N -4. Now, each of these N-4 people has to pay more. The extra amount per person is Rs.4. So the new share per person is (96/N) +4.\n\nWait, no, actually, the total cost remains the same, right? The Rs.96 is fixed. So when four people didn't come, the remaining had to cover the same amount. So the original plan was each pays 96/N. After four didn't come, each pays 96/(N-4). And the new amount is Rs.4 more than the original.\n\nSo, mathematically, 96/(N-4) = (96/N) +4.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Let me write that equation down.\n\n96/(N-4) = (96/N) +4.\n\nNow I need to solve this equation for N. Let's do that step by step.\n\nFirst, I can subtract 96/N from both sides to get:\n\n96/(N-4) - 96/N =4.\n\nLet me combine the two fractions on the left. To subtract them, I'll find a common denominator, which is N(N-4).\n\nSo, [96*N - 96*(N-4)] / [N(N-4)] =4.\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n96N - 96N + 384 = 384.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n384 / [N(N-4)] =4.\n\nMultiply both sides by N(N-4):\n\n384 =4*N(N-4).\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n96 = N(N-4).\n\nSo now I have the quadratic equation:\n\nN\u00b2 -4N -96=0.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 4*N(N-4)=4N\u00b2-16N. So 384=4N\u00b2-16N. Then dividing by 4 gives 96 =N\u00b2-4N \u2192 N\u00b2-4N-96=0.\n\nNow I need to solve for N. Let's use the quadratic formula. The equation is N\u00b2 -4N -96=0.\n\nThe quadratic formula is N = [4 \u00b1 sqrt( (4)^2 +4*96 ) ] /2.\n\nCompute the discriminant: 16 + 384 =400.\n\nSo sqrt(400)=20.\n\nSo N = [4 \u00b120]/2.\n\nWe have two solutions: (4+20)/2=24/2=12, and (4-20)/2=-16/2=-8.\n\nSince the number of people can't be negative, N=12.\n\nWait, so the original number of friends was 12. But the question asks for the number who attended. Four didn't come, so attendees are 12-4=8.\n\nSo the answer is 8, which is option A.\n\nLet me quickly check this. If 8 people attended, each pays 96/8=12. Originally, each was supposed to pay 96/12=8. So 12 is 4 more than 8. Yes, that matches the problem statement.\n",

I need to find out how many attended the picnic.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. Let's say the total number of friends who were supposed to go is N. But four didn't come, so the number of attendees is N-4. \n\nOriginally, each person was supposed to contribute some amount, right? So the total cost is 96, so each person's share would be 96 divided by N.

Let's see, maybe I can rearrange this equation. Let's subtract 96/N from both sides to get:\n\n96/(N-4) - 96/N = 4.\n\nFactor out 96, so 96 [1/(N-4) - 1/N] = 4.\n\nSimplify the terms inside the brackets. 1/(N-4) - 1/N equals [N - (N-4)] / [N(N-4)] which is [4]/[N(N-4)].\n\nSo now the equation becomes 96 * [4/(N(N-4))] =4.\n\nSo 96*4/(N(N-4)) =4.

Because of that, the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each. I need to find out how many attended the picnic.\n\nWait, let me break it down.

Because the total cost remains the same, but the number of people changed. So the new amount each has to pay is 96 divided by (N-4), right? So 96/(N-4). And this amount is Rs. 4 more than the original share.\n\nSo putting this together, the original share per person was 96/N. The new share is 96/(N-4).

Let's see, 12 and 8: 12-8=4. But since the middle term is -4, maybe 12 and -8?\n\nSo (N - 12)(N +8) = 0. Because (N-12)(N+8) = N\u00b2 -12N +8N -96 = N\u00b2 -4N -96. Yes, that works.\n\nSo the roots are N=12 and N=-8. Since the number of people can't be negative, N=12.\n\nWait, but wait. The original number was N=12. So the number of attendees is N-4=8.

So, each person's share would be 96 divided by n, right? So, each was supposed to pay 96/n rupees.\n\nBut then four friends didn't come. So the number of people who actually went is n - 4. Now, because four people didn't come, the remaining ones have to cover the same total amount, Rs. 96, but with fewer people. So each now has to pay more. The problem says each had to contribute Rs. 4 extra.\n\nSo, the new amount each person has to pay is (96/n) + 4. But wait, that's not quite right. Let me think again. Oh, wait, no. Because the original share per person is 96/n, and after four didn't come, the new share is 96/(n-4). And the difference between the new share and the original share is 4 rupees. So the equation should be:\n\n96/(n - 4) = 96/n + 4\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the new share per person is equal to the original share plus 4.\n\nNow I need to solve for n. Let's write the equation again:\n\n96/(n - 4) = (96/n) + 4\n\nHmm, solving this equation. Maybe I can rearrange it. Let's subtract 96/n from both sides:\n\n96/(n-4) - 96/n = 4\n\nFactor out 96 from the left side:\n\n96 [1/(n-4) - 1/n] = 4\n\nCompute the difference inside the brackets. Let's find a common denominator, which would be n(n-4). So:\n\n1/(n-4) - 1/n = [n - (n-4)] / [n(n-4)] = (n - n +4)/[n(n-4)] = 4/[n(n-4)]\n\nSo substituting back:\n\n96 * [4/(n(n-4))] = 4\n\nSimplify left side: 96 *4 = 384, so:\n\n384 / [n(n-4)] =4\n\nMultiply both sides by [n(n-4)]:\n\n384 =4 * n(n-4)\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n96 = n(n-4)\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nn\u00b2 -4n -96 =0\n\nNow I need to solve this quadratic equation. Let's see if I can factor it.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -96 and add to -4. Let's think: 12 and -8? Because 12 * (-8) = -96, and 12 + (-8) =4. Wait, but the equation is n\u00b2 -4n -96. So the middle term is -4n.\n\nWait, let me write it as n\u00b2 -4n -96 = 0. So factors would be (n - a)(n + b) = 0, where a*b=96 and a - b=4. Hmm, let's see:\n\nLooking for factors of 96 where a - b=4. Let's list factors of 96:\n\n1 and 96 \u2192 difference 95 no.\n\n2 and 48 \u2192 46 no.\n\n3 and 32 \u2192 29 no.\n\n4 and 24 \u2192 20 no.\n\n6 and 16 \u2192 10 no.\n\n8 and 12 \u2192 difference 4! Yes, that's it.\n\nSo a=12 and b=8. So the factors would be (n - 12)(n +8) =0. So n=12 or n=-8.\n\nBut n can't be negative, so n=12.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check if that's correct. So n=12. So originally, there were 12 friends. But four didn't come, so 8 attended.\n\nLet me check the original share: 96/12=8 rupees each.\n\nAfter four didn't come, the new share is 96/8=12 rupees each. The difference is 12-8=4, which matches the problem statement. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the number of those who attended is 8, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, A is 8, which is what I got. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the equation setup.\n\nAlternative approach: Let me denote the number of attendees as x. Then the original number would have been x +4.\n\nOriginal share per person: 96/(x+4)\n\nNew share: 96/x\n\nAccording to the problem, the new share is 4 rupees more. So:\n\n96/x = 96/(x+4) +4\n\nWhich is the same equation as before, but let's solve it this way.\n\nMultiply both sides by x(x+4):\n\n96(x+4) =96x +4x(x+4)\n\nExpand both sides:\n\n96x + 384 =96x +4x\u00b2 +16x\n\nSimplify:\n\nLeft: 96x +384\n\nRight: (96x +16x) +4x\u00b2 \u2192 112x +4x\u00b2\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n96x +384 -112x -4x\u00b2 =0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-16x +384 -4x\u00b2=0\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 to make it positive:\n\n4x\u00b2 +16x -384=0\n\nDivide all terms by 4:\n\nx\u00b2 +4x -96=0\n\nSo same equation as before. Solve using quadratic formula:\n\nx = [-4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 384)] / 2 \u2192 sqrt(400)=20.\n\nSo x=(-4 +20)/2=16/2=8, or x=(-4-20)/2=-12, which is negative. So x=8.\n\nSo the number of attendees is 8, which is option A.\n",
