      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let's see what it's about. I have a money pouch with Rs. 700, and there are equal numbers of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins, and one rupee coins. I need to find out how many of each coin there are. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nWait, the coins are 25 p, 50 p, and 1 rupee. Oh, right, 1 rupee is 100 paise. And all three types have the same number of coins. So, let's say the number of each coin is 'n'. So, n coins of 25 p, n of 50 p, and n of 100 p.\n\nSo, the total amount would be the sum of each type multiplied by their value. Let's calculate each part.\n\nFor 25 p coins: each is 0.25 rupees. So n * 0.25.\n\nFor 50 p coins: each is 0.50 rupees. So n * 0.50.\n\nFor 1 rupee coins: each is 1.00 rupees. So n * 1.00.\n\nAdding all these together gives the total amount, which is 700 rupees.\n\nSo the equation would be:\n\n0.25n + 0.50n + 1.00n = 700\n\nLet me add those up. 0.25 + 0.50 is 0.75, plus 1 is 1.75. So 1.75n = 700.\n\nTo find n, I can divide both sides by 1.75.\n\nn = 700 / 1.75\n\nHmm, what's 700 divided by 1.75? Let's calculate that. 1.75 times 400 is 700, because 1.75 * 400 = 700. Because 1.75 * 100 is 175, so times 4 is 700.\n\nWait, wait. No, wait. Let me think again. 1.75 multiplied by 400 is 700? Because 1.75 * 400 is (1 *400) + (0.75*400) = 400 + 300 = 700. Yes, that's correct. So n is 400.\n\nSo each type has 400 coins. So the number of each is 400, right?\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 400. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's double-check.\n\n25 p coins: 400 * 0.25 = 100 rupees.\n\n50 p coins: 400 * 0.50 = 200 rupees.\n\n1 rupee coins: 400 * 1 = 400 rupees.\n\nAdding them up: 100 + 200 + 400 = 700. Yep, that matches the total. So yeah, 400 of each. So the answer is C.\n",

Inside are 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins, and one rupee coins. The important thing is that the number of each type of coin is equal. I need to find out how many of each coin there are.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. First, I should probably convert everything into the same unit to make it easier. Since the coins are in paise and rupees, maybe converting everything to paise would help because 1 rupee is 100 paise. So, Rs. 700 is equal to 700 * 100 = 70,000 paise. That makes the total amount 70,000 paise.\n\nNow, the number of each coin is the same. Let's say the number of 25 paise coins is x, the same as the number of 50 paise and 1 rupee coins. Wait, but the 1 rupee coins are 100 paise each. So each type has x coins.\n\nSo, the total amount contributed by each type would be:\n\n- 25 paise coins: 25 * x paise\n- 50 paise coins: 50 * x paise\n- 1 rupee coins: 100 * x paise\n\nAdding all these together should give the total amount, which is 70,000 paise.

So:\n\n175x = 70,000\n\nTo find x, I divide both sides by 175.\n\nx = 70,000 / 175\n\nHmm, calculating that. Let me see, 70,000 divided by 175. Let me think about how to do this division.\n\nAlternatively, I can simplify the fraction. 70,000 divided by 175. Let's see, 175 times 400 is 70,000 because 175*400 is 70,000. Wait, because 175 * 100 is 17,500, so 175 * 400 is 17,500 *4, which is 70,000. So x is 400.\n\nSo each type has 400 coins.

The options are given as A to E, and I have to pick the right one.\n\nWait, wait. Let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The total amount is 700 rupees. There are three types of coins: 25 paise, 50 paise, and 1 rupee. And the number of each type is the same. So, if there are 'x' coins of 25 paise, there are also 'x' of 50 paise and 'x' of 1 rupee. Got it.\n\nSo, let's break this down. Each 25 paise coin is worth 0.25 rupees. Each 50 paise is 0.50 rupees, and each one rupee coin is obviously 1 rupee. Since there are equal numbers of each, the total amount contributed by each type would be x multiplied by their respective values.\n\nSo the total amount would be the sum of all these.

So the equation becomes:\n\nx * 1.75 = 700.\n\nSo, to find x, I can divide 700 by 1.75.\n\nHmm, let me do that calculation. 700 divided by 1.75.

So 700 * (4/7) = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 700 divided by 7 is 100, right? Because 7 times 100 is 700. Then, 100 multiplied by 4 is 400. So x equals 400.\n\nWait, so each type of coin has 400 coins?

So, the correct option is C.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the number of each type of coin in a money pouch containing Rs. 700, where the number of 25 paise, 50 paise, and one-rupee coins is equal. \n\nFirst, convert the total amount to paise:  \n\\[\n700 \\, \\text{rupees} = 700 \\times 100 = 70,000 \\, \\text{paise}.\n\\]\n\nLet \\( n \\) represent the number of each type of coin. The total contribution of each coin type to the total amount is:  \n\\[\n25n \\, \\text{(from 25 paise coins)}, \\quad 50n \\, \\text{(from 50 paise coins)}, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 100n \\, \\text{(from one-rupee coins)}.\n\\]\n\nThe sum of these contributions equals the total amount:  \n\\[\n25n + 50n + 100n = 70,000.\n\\]\n\nSimplify the equation:  \n\\[\n175n = 70,000.\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\( n \\):  \n\\[\nn = \\frac{70,000}{175} = 400.\n\\]\n\nThus, there are 400 coins of each type. Verifying the calculation:  \n\\[\n25 \\times 400 = 10,000 \\, \\text{paise}, \\quad 50 \\times 400 = 20,000 \\, \\text{paise}, \\quad 100 \\times 400 = 40,000 \\, \\text{paise}.\n\\]\nAdding these gives \\( 10,000 + 20,000 + 40,000 = 70,000 \\, \\text{paise}, \\) confirming the solution is correct.\n\nThe correct answer is **C) 400**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a money pouch with Rs. 700. The coins inside are 25 paise, 50 paise, and one rupee coins. And the thing is, there are equal numbers of each type of coin. I need to find out how many of each coin there are. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I should probably convert all the money into the same unit to make it easier. Since the coins are in paise, maybe converting the total amount into paise would work. Oh right, because 1 rupee is 100 paise. So Rs. 700 is 700 * 100 = 70,000 paise. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the problem says there are equal numbers of each coin. Let's say the number of each coin is 'n'. So, there are n coins of 25 paise, n of 50 paise, and n of 100 paise (since one rupee is 100 paise). \n\nWait, no, wait a second. Wait, no. The coins are 25, 50, and 100 paise. So each coin contributes a certain amount. Let me write down the equation.\n\nThe total amount contributed by each type would be:\n- 25 paise coins: 25 * n\n- 50 paise coins: 50 * n\n- 100 paise coins: 100 * n\n\nAdding all these together should give the total amount, which is 70,000 paise. So the equation is:\n\n25n + 50n + 100n = 70000\n\nLet me add those up. 25 + 50 is 75, plus 100 is 175. So 175n = 70000.\n\nTo find n, I'll divide both sides by 175. Let me calculate that.\n\n70000 divided by 175. Hmm, I can simplify this. Let's see, 175 times 400 is 70,000 because 175*4 is 700, so 175*400 is 70,000. So n must be 400.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option C is 400. But wait, the options are a bit confusing. The options are A)453, B)651, C)400, D)487, E)286. Oh, so the number of each coin is 400, right? So each type has 400 coins. That would be the answer.\n\nLet me double-check. 400 coins of 25 p is 400*25=10,000 p. 400 coins of 50 p is 20,000 p. 400 coins of 100 p is 40,000 p. Adding those: 10k + 20k is 30k, plus 40k is 70k. Yep, that's 70,000 paise, which is 700 rupees. That matches.\n\nSo the correct answer should be 400 for each coin. So the option C is the right one.\n",
