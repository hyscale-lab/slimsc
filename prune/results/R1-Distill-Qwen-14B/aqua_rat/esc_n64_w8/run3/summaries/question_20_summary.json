      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me see if I can figure it out step by step. The question is:\n\n[5 + ? \u00d7 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 \u00d7 13 - 156] = 6\n\nAnd the options are A)4, B)4.5, C)5, D)5.5, E)6.5.\n\nHmm, I think I'll start by simplifying both the numerator and the denominator. Let's tackle the denominator first because it looks straightforward.\n\nDenominator: 13 \u00d7 13 minus 156. Let me calculate that. 13 times 13 is 169. Then subtract 156. So 169 - 156 equals 13. Oh, that's nice, the denominator is 13.\n\nNow the equation becomes [5 + ? \u00d719 -15 -7] / 13 = 6.\n\nWait, so the whole numerator divided by 13 equals 6. To find the numerator, I can multiply both sides by 13. Let me write that down:\n\nNumerator = 6 \u00d7 13.\n\n6 times 13 is 78.

So:\n\n? \u00d719 = 95.\n\nTo find ?, I divide both sides by 19. So 95 divided by 19 is... let's see, 19 times 5 is 95. Oh right, so ? is 5.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is 5.

Let me read it again.\n\nThe equation is [5 + ? \u00d7 19 - 15 - 7] divided by [13 \u00d7 13 - 156] equals 6. And there are options given, from A to E. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should simplify both the numerator and the denominator separately. That might make it easier to handle. Let's start with the denominator because it looks a bit simpler.\n\nThe denominator is 13 multiplied by 13 minus 156. Let me compute that. 13 times 13 is... 169, right? Because 10 times 10 is 100, 3 times 10 is 30, 10 times 3 is another 30, and 3 times 3 is 9. So 100 + 30 +30 +9 = 169. Then subtract 156 from that. So 169 minus 156 is... 13, I think. Because 156 plus 13 is 169. Yeah, so the denominator simplifies to 13.\n\nNow, the entire equation becomes [5 + ? \u00d719 -15 -7] divided by 13 equals 6. Let me write that as:\n\n(5 + x*19 -15 -7) / 13 = 6, where x is the missing number.\n\nWait, maybe I should rearrange the numerator. Let's compute the constants first. 5 minus 15 minus 7. Let's see, 5 minus 15 is -10, then minus 7 is -17. So the numerator simplifies to (-17 + 19x). So the equation is (-17 + 19x)/13 = 6.\n\nHmm, I can rewrite this equation to solve for x. Multiply both sides by 13 to get rid of the denominator. So:\n\n-17 + 19x = 6 * 13\n\n6 times 13 is 78. So now the equation is:\n\n-17 + 19x = 78\n\nI need to solve for x. Let's add 17 to both sides. 78 plus 17 is... 95, because 70+17=87, plus 8 is 95? Wait, wait, 78 +10 is 88, +7 is 95. Yeah.\n\nSo 19x = 95.\n\nThen x is 95 divided by 19. Let me compute that. 19 times 5 is 95, right? Because 20 times 5 is 100, minus 5 is 95. So x is 5.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes I mix up signs or calculations.\n\nSo starting again, the denominator: 13\u00d713 is 169. 169 minus 156 is indeed 13. That's correct.\n\nNumerator: 5 + x*19 -15 -7. Let's compute the constants: 5-15 is -10, minus 7 is -17. So it's -17 +19x. Correct.\n\nSo equation: (-17 +19x)/13 =6.\n\nMultiply both sides by 13: -17 +19x=78. Correct.\n\nAdd 17: 19x=78+17=95.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably simplify both the numerator and the denominator as much as I can, then solve for the unknown. Let's start with the denominator because it looks like it's just numbers, no variables. The denominator is 13 multiplied by 13 minus 156. \n\nSo, 13 times 13 is 169. Then subtract 156 from that.

Calculating \\(13 \\times 13 = 169\\) and then subtracting \\(156\\), we find the denominator is \\(169 - 156 = 13\\).\n\nNext, we simplify the numerator. Let the unknown number be \\(x\\). The numerator becomes:\n\n\\[\n5 + x \\times 19 - 15 - 7\n\\]\n\nCombining constants: \\(5 - 15 = -10\\) and \\(-10 - 7 = -17\\). Thus, the numerator simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n-17 + 19x\n\\]\n\nThe equation now is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-17 + 19x}{13} = 6\n\\]\n\nTo isolate \\(x\\), multiply both sides by \\(13\\):\n\n\\[\n-17 + 19x = 6 \\times 13 = 78\n\\]\n\nAdd \\(17\\) to both sides:\n\n\\[\n19x = 78 + 17 = 95\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by \\(19\\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{95}{19} = 5\n\\]\n\nFinally, verify by substituting \\(x = 5\\) back into the original equation. The numerator becomes:\n\n\\[\n5 + 5 \\times 19 - 15 - 7 = 5 + 95 - 15 - 7 = 78\n\\]\n\nThe denominator is \\(13\\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{78}{13} = 6\n\\]\n\nThis confirms the solution is correct. The missing number is \\(5\\).\n\nAnswer: C",

The equation is [5 + ? \u00d7 19 - 15 - 7] divided by [13 \u00d7 13 - 156] equals 6. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the denominator because that might be easier to compute. The denominator is 13 multiplied by 13 minus 156. Let me calculate that. 13 times 13 is 169. Then, subtracting 156 from that gives me 169 - 156 = 13. Oh, that's nice, the denominator simplifies to 13.\n\nNow, the equation simplifies to [5 + ? \u00d7 19 - 15 - 7] divided by 13 equals 6. To make it easier, I'll rewrite the equation as:\n\n(5 + (unknown) \u00d7 19 - 15 -7) / 13 = 6\n\nI think I should first handle the numerator. Let's compute the constants in the numerator without the unknown. So, 5 minus 15 minus 7. Let me add those up: 5 -15 is -10, and -10 minus 7 is -17. So the numerator becomes (-17) + (unknown \u00d7 19).\n\nSo the numerator is (19 \u00d7 unknown) -17. And the whole fraction equals 6. So putting it together:\n\n(19 \u00d7 unknown - 17) / 13 = 6\n\nTo solve for the unknown, I'll multiply both sides by 13. That gives:\n\n19 \u00d7 unknown -17 = 6 \u00d7 13\n\nCalculating 6 times 13, that's 78. So the equation becomes:\n\n19 \u00d7 unknown - 17 = 78\n\nNow, I'll add 17 to both sides to isolate the term with the unknown. Adding 17 to 78 gives me 95. So:\n\n19 \u00d7 unknown = 95\n\nTo find the unknown, I'll divide both sides by 19. So:\n\nunknown = 95 / 19\n\nWhat's 95 divided by 19? Well, 19 times 5 is 95 because 19\u00d75=95.
