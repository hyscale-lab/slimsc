      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a shopkeeper who gave a 20% discount on all items for a day, and now he needs to bring the prices back to the original. The question is asking by what percentage he must increase the discounted price to get back to the original. Hmm, I remember this has something to do with percentage increase, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact calculation. Let me think this through step by step.\n\nAlright, let's say the original price of an item is $100. I pick 100 because percentages are easier to work with that way. So, with a 20% discount, the price drops by 20% of 100. That would be 20, right? So the discounted price is 100 minus 20, which is $80.\n\nNow, the next day, the shopkeeper wants to sell the item again at the original price of $100. But the current price is $80. So he needs to increase $80 to $100. The question is, what percentage increase from $80 will bring it back to $100?\n\nI think the formula for percentage increase is ((New Price - Original Price)/Original Price) * 100%. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the original in this case is the discounted price, right? Because he's increasing from the discounted value back to the original. So the formula should be ((Desired Price - Current Price)/Current Price) * 100%.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers: Desired is 100, current is 80. So (100 - 80) is 20. Then 20 divided by 80 is 0.25. Multiply by 100% gives 25%. So the increase needed is 25%.\n\nLet me double-check. If I take 80 and increase it by 25%, what do I get? 25% of 80 is 20. Adding that to 80 gives 100. Yep, that works.\n\nWait, but sometimes when dealing with percentages, people get confused about which value to use as the base. Like, if the original price was 100, and it went down 20% to 80, then to get back up, you can't just use the same 20% because the base has changed. So the percentage increase has to be calculated relative to the lower amount, which is 80. So 25% is the correct answer.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 25%. So that should be the right choice.\n",

Suppose the original price of an item is, say, $100. That makes calculations easier. On the first day, he gives a 20% discount. So 20% of 100 is $20. So the discounted price is $80. Now, the next day, he wants to sell it at the original $100 again. But he's currently selling it at $80. So he needs to increase $80 to $100. How much is that increase in percentage?\n\nI remember that percentage increase is calculated by (Increase / Original) * 100. In this case, the original is $80 because that's the price he's currently selling at before the increase. The increase needed is $20 (from 80 to 100). So the calculation would be (20 / 80) * 100.

The question is asking by what percentage he must increase the discounted price to get back to the original price. The options are A to E, and I have to pick the correct one.\n\nHmm, right. So let me think about how percentages work in discounts and then figuring out the required increase. I remember that when you have a discount, the new price is a certain percentage of the original. Then, to find the increase needed to get back to the original, you can't just add the same percentage because percentages are relative to different bases.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's say the original price of an item is $100. That makes the math easier because percentages will be straightforward.\n\nSo, if the original price is $100, and there's a 20% discount, what's the discounted price? Well, 20% of 100 is 20, so the discounted price is 100 - 20 = $80.\n\nNow, the next day, the shopkeeper wants to sell it back to the original price, which is $100. But the discounted price was $80, so he needs to increase it from $80 to $100. The question is, what's the percentage increase needed?\n\nWait, percentage increase is calculated based on the original amount you're increasing from. So, in this case, the original is the discounted price, which is $80. The increase needed is $20 because 100 -80 =20.\n\nSo, the formula for percentage increase is (Increase / Original) * 100%. Here, the increase is $20, and the original is $80. So it's (20 /80) *100.\n\nLet me compute that. 20 divided by 80 is 0.25. Multiply by 100, that's 25%.

Sometimes, these problems can trick you by making you think it's a 20% decrease, so you might think the increase is 20%, but that's not correct because the base changes.\n\nYes, the initial discount is 20% off the original price. So the discounted price is 80% of the original. Then, when you're increasing from the discounted price (80) to 100, the increase is 25% of 80. So yes, 25% is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: Let me denote the original price as P. After a 20% discount, the price becomes P*(1 - 0.20) = 0.80P. Now, to find the percentage increase (let's call it x) needed to go from 0.80P to P.\n\nSo, the equation is 0.80P * (1 + x) = P.\n\nDivide both sides by 0.80P: (1 + x) = 1 / 0.80.\n\nWhat's 1 divided by 0.80? Well, 0.80 is 4/5, so 1/(4/5) is 5/4, which is 1.25.\n\nSo, 1 + x = 1.25 \u2192 x = 0.25 \u2192 25%.\n\nYep, same result. So definitely, the answer is 25%, which is option C.\n",

Let's read it again.\n\nThe problem is about a shopkeeper who gave a 20% discount on all items for one day. Now, the next day, he wants to sell them at the original price again. The question is, by what percentage must he increase the discounted price to get back to the original price? The options are A)21%, B)20%, C)25%, D)33%, E)18%.\n\nHmm, right. So I need to calculate the percentage increase required from the discounted price to reach the original price. Let me think about how percentages work here.\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose the original price of an item is $100. Because percentages are easier to visualize with 100. So, if the original price is $100, a 20% discount would make the price $80. Because 20% of 100 is 20, subtract that and you get 80.\n\nNow, the next day, the shopkeeper wants to bring the price back up to $100 from $80. So the question is, what percentage increase from $80 gets us back to $100?\n\nI remember that percentage increase is calculated based on the original value, which in this case is the discounted price ($80). So the formula is:\n\nPercentage Increase = [(New Price - Discounted Price) / Discounted Price] * 100%\n\nPlugging in the numbers: New Price is $100, Discounted Price is $80.\n\nSo it's (100 - 80)/80 * 100% = (20)/80 * 100% = 0.25 * 100% = 25%.\n\nWait, so the percentage increase needed is 25%. So looking back at the options, option C is 25%.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Because sometimes with percentage problems, it's easy to confuse which value is the base.\n\nLet me try another approach without assuming the original price. Let the original price be P. The discounted price is P minus 20% of P, which is 0.8P.\n\nNow, to find the percentage increase needed to go from 0.8P back to P. So the increase needed is P - 0.8P = 0.2P.\n\nThe percentage increase is (0.2P) / (0.8P) * 100% = (0.2 / 0.8) * 100% = 0.25 * 100% = 25%. Yep, same result.\n\nSo the correct answer should be C)25%.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it again.\n\nThe problem is about a shopkeeper who gave a 20% discount on all items for one day. Now, the next day, he wants to sell them at the original price again. The question is, by what percentage must he increase the discounted price to get back to the original price? The options are A)21%, B)20%, C)25%, D)33%, E)18%.\n\nHmm, right. So I need to calculate the percentage increase required from the discounted price to reach the original price. Let me think about how percentages work here.\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose the original price of an item is $100. Because percentages are easier to visualize with 100. So, if the original price is $100, a 20% discount would make the price $80. Because 20% of 100 is 20, subtract that and you get 80.\n\nNow, the next day, the shopkeeper wants to bring the price back up to $100 from $80. So the question is, what percentage increase from $80 gets us back to $100?\n\nI remember that percentage increase is calculated based on the original value, which in this case is the discounted price ($80). So the formula is:\n\nPercentage Increase = [(New Price - Discounted Price) / Discounted Price] * 100%\n\nPlugging in the numbers: New Price is $100, Discounted Price is $80.\n\nSo it's (100 - 80)/80 * 100% = (20)/80 * 100% = 0.25 * 100% = 25%.\n\nWait, so the percentage increase needed is 25%. So looking back at the options, option C is 25%.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Because sometimes with percentage problems, it's easy to confuse which value is the base.\n\nLet me try another approach without assuming the original price. Let the original price be P. The discounted price is P minus 20% of P, which is 0.8P.\n\nNow, to find the percentage increase needed to go from 0.8P back to P. So the increase needed is P - 0.8P = 0.2P.\n\nThe percentage increase is (0.2P) / (0.8P) * 100% = (0.2 / 0.8) * 100% = 0.25 * 100% = 25%. Yep, same result.\n\nSo the correct answer should be C)25%.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage increase needed to return the discounted price to the original price, let the original price be \\( P \\). After a 20% discount, the price becomes \\( 0.8P \\). To find the percentage increase required to go from \\( 0.8P \\) back to \\( P \\), use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\frac{P - 0.8P}{0.8P} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{0.2P}{0.8P} \\times 100\\% = 0.25 \\times 100\\% = 25\\%.\n\\]\n\nThus, the shopkeeper must increase the discounted price by **25%** to return to the original price.\n\nAnswer: C",

I need to figure out by what percentage he must increase the discounted price to get back to the original. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, so let's say the original price of an item is, I don't know, maybe $100. I pick 100 because percentages are easy with that. So if the original price is $100, and he gives a 20% discount, what does the discounted price become?\n\n20% of 100 is 20, right? So the discounted price is 100 minus 20, which is $80. Now, the next day, he wants to sell it back at the original price of $100. So he needs to increase the $80 to $100.\n\nThe question is, what percentage increase from $80 to $100 is needed? I remember that percentage increase is calculated based on the original value before the increase, which in this case is the discounted price, $80.\n\nSo the formula for percentage increase is: (New Price - Old Price) / Old Price * 100%. Plugging in the numbers, that's (100 - 80) / 80 * 100%. Let me compute that.\n\n100 minus 80 is 20. So 20 divided by 80 is 0.25. Multiply by 100% gives 25%. So he needs to increase the price by 25% to get back to the original.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I choose a different original price, would that change anything? Let's try with $200 as the original price. 20% discount would be 40, so the discounted price is 160. To get back to 200, the increase needed is 40. So (40/160)*100 is 25% again. Yep, same result.\n\nAnother way to look at it: the discount reduces the price to 80% of the original (since 100% -20% =80%). So to get back to 100%, you need to find what percentage increase from 80% brings you back to 100%.\n\nSo, let me denote the required percentage as x. So 80% * (1 + x) = 100%. Solving for x: 1 + x = 100/80 \u2192 1 + x = 1.25 \u2192 x=0.25 or 25%. \n\nOh wait, another approach: the increase needed is the difference between the original and the discounted price. So the increase is 20, as before. The base for the percentage is the discounted price, 80. So 20/80 is 0.25, which is 25%.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the correct answer is 25%, which is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a shopkeeper who gave a 20% discount and now wants to bring the prices back to the original. I need to figure out by what percentage he must increase the discounted price to get back to the original. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, so let's say the original price of an item is, I don't know, maybe $100. I pick 100 because percentages are easy with that. So if the original price is $100, and he gives a 20% discount, what does the discounted price become?\n\n20% of 100 is 20, right? So the discounted price is 100 minus 20, which is $80. Now, the next day, he wants to sell it back at the original price of $100. So he needs to increase the $80 to $100.\n\nThe question is, what percentage increase from $80 to $100 is needed? I remember that percentage increase is calculated based on the original value before the increase, which in this case is the discounted price, $80.\n\nSo the formula for percentage increase is: (New Price - Old Price) / Old Price * 100%. Plugging in the numbers, that's (100 - 80) / 80 * 100%. Let me compute that.\n\n100 minus 80 is 20. So 20 divided by 80 is 0.25. Multiply by 100% gives 25%. So he needs to increase the price by 25% to get back to the original.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I choose a different original price, would that change anything? Let's try with $200 as the original price. 20% discount would be 40, so the discounted price is 160. To get back to 200, the increase needed is 40. So (40/160)*100 is 25% again. Yep, same result.\n\nAnother way to look at it: the discount reduces the price to 80% of the original (since 100% -20% =80%). So to get back to 100%, you need to find what percentage increase from 80% brings you back to 100%.\n\nSo, let me denote the required percentage as x. So 80% * (1 + x) = 100%. Solving for x: 1 + x = 100/80 \u2192 1 + x = 1.25 \u2192 x=0.25 or 25%. \n\nOh wait, another approach: the increase needed is the difference between the original and the discounted price. So the increase is 20, as before. The base for the percentage is the discounted price, 80. So 20/80 is 0.25, which is 25%.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the correct answer is 25%, which is option C.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage increase needed to return the discounted price to the original price, let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Original Price and Discount**: Assume the original price of an item is \\( P \\). After a 20% discount, the new price becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Discounted Price} = P - 0.20P = 0.80P\n   \\]\n\n2. **Desired Price**: The shopkeeper wants to return the price to the original price \\( P \\).
