      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe problem says: x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days. Then the question is, how much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days? The options are given as A to E.\n\nHmm, this seems like a work-rate problem. I remember that work problems usually involve figuring out how much work someone can do based on the number of workers, time, and rates. Let me think about the basic formula. I think it's something like Work equals Men multiplied by Time multiplied by Rate, or W = M * T * R. So each factor contributes to the total work done.\n\nWait, in this case, the problem is giving me a scenario where all three variables (number of men, hours per day, days) are the same, x. So initially, x men, x hours/day, x days, resulting in x units of work.\n\nI think I can set up an equation based on this. Let's denote the rate at which each man works as r units per hour. So each man contributes r units every hour.\n\nSo the initial work done would be x (men) multiplied by x (hours per day) multiplied by x (days) multiplied by r (rate). But wait, that might not be right. Let me think again. Oh, no, wait: each man works x hours a day for x days. So the total man-hours is x * x * x, which is x^3. Then the work done is x units. So the work is x units, and the man-hours are x^3. So the rate per man-hour would be Work divided by (Men * Hours * Days), which is x / x^3 = 1/x^2. So each man-hour contributes 1/x\u00b2 units of work.\n\nWait, that might make sense. So each man-hour is 1/x\u00b2 units.\n\nNow the question is, how much work can y men do in y days, working y hours per day? So the total man-hours in this case would be y * y * y, which is y\u00b3. And since each man-hour gives 1/x\u00b2 units, the total work would be y\u00b3 * (1/x\u00b2) = y\u00b3 / x\u00b2.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is y\u00b3/x\u00b2. So that would be the answer. But let me double-check my reasoning.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to find the work rate. Let's consider the initial scenario: x men, x hours/day, x days, x units. So the total man-hours are x * x * x = x\u00b3. The work done is x units, so the rate is x / x\u00b3 = 1/x\u00b2 per man-hour.\n\nIn the second scenario, the total man-hours are y * y * y = y\u00b3. So the work done would be rate * man-hours, which is (1/x\u00b2) * y\u00b3 = y\u00b3 / x\u00b2. So that's the same as before.\n\nWait, so option B is y\u00b3/x\u00b2, which matches. So the answer should be option B.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't mix up any variables. Let me think of an example. Suppose x is 2. So 2 men, 2 hours/day, for 2 days. They complete 2 units of work.\n\nSo total man-hours: 2 * 2 * 2 =8. Work done is 2 units. So each man-hour contributes 2/8 = 0.25 units, which is 1/(2^2) = 1/4, which matches. So if I set x=2, then the rate per man-hour is 1/(x\u00b2) = 1/4.\n\nNow, if y is 4, then y^3 =64, and x\u00b2 is 4. So 64/4=16 units. Let's see, with 4 men, 4 hours/day, 4 days. Man-hours:4*4*4=64. Each contributes 0.25 units, so 64 *0.25=16 units. Which is correct. So yes, the formula works in this case.\n\nSo the answer should be B: y\u00b3/x\u00b2 units.\n",

Let me read the question again.\n\nThe problem says: x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days. How much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days?\n\nHmm, okay. I remember that work problems usually involve the concept of man-hours or something like that. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the initial scenario. We have x men, each working x hours a day, for x days, and they complete x units of work. So, I think I can figure out how much work one man can do in one hour.\n\nWait, let me think. Work is usually calculated as the number of workers multiplied by time (hours or days). So maybe I should find the total man-hours and then see how much work that corresponds to.\n\nSo, for the first part: x men * x hours/day * x days. That would give me the total man-hours. Let me calculate that: x * x * x = x^3 man-hours. And this amount of work produces x units of work. So, the work done is x units.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because if x^3 man-hours result in x units, then each unit requires (x^3)/x = x^2 man-hours. So each unit is x\u00b2 man-hours. Hmm, maybe that's the key here.\n\nAlternatively, the rate at which work is done is important. Let me think in terms of man-hour per unit. So, total work is x units, done in x^3 man-hours. So per unit, it's x^3 / x = x\u00b2 man-hours per unit. So each unit takes x\u00b2 man-hours.\n\nNow, the second part is y men, y hours per day, for y days. So, the total man-hours here would be y * y * y = y^3. Because each day they work y hours, and there are y days, so per day it's y men * y hours, and over y days, it's y^3 man-hours.\n\nSo, if each unit takes x\u00b2 man-hours, then the number of units they can complete is total man-hours divided by man-hours per unit. That would be y^3 / x\u00b2. So the work done is y\u00b3 / x\u00b2 units.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me try plugging in numbers to test. Let's say x=2. So 2 men, 2 hours per day, for 2 days. They do 2 units. So, the total man-hours are 2 * 2 * 2 =8. That gives 2 units, so each unit is 4 man-hours. So per unit is x\u00b2=4, which matches.\n\nNow, let's take y=4. So 4 men, 4 hours a day, for 4 days. Total man-hours is 4*4*4=64. Each unit is 4 man-hours, so 64 /4=16 units. So according to the formula y\u00b3/x\u00b2, that would be 64/(2^2) =64/4=16. That matches. So that's correct.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is y\u00b3/x\u00b2. So the answer should be B.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I have this problem about work, men, hours, and days. Hmm. So, the question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nAlright, the initial statement says: x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days. I need to find out how much work y men working y hours per day can do in y days.\n\nWait, so the initial scenario is all x's. Let me think about how work is calculated. I remember that work is usually calculated as the number of workers multiplied by the time they spend working. But time itself is in days, so maybe I should convert that into hours?\n\nOh right, because the hours per day are given. So the formula for work should be something like:\n\nWork = Number of Men \u00d7 Number of Hours per Day \u00d7 Number of Days.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. The basic work formula is Work = Men \u00d7 Time. But Time here is in days, so each day they work a certain number of hours. So the total time would be the number of days multiplied by the number of hours per day. So maybe the formula is:\n\nWork = Men \u00d7 (Hours per Day \u00d7 Days)\n\nWhich can also be written as Work = Men \u00d7 Hours \u00d7 Days.\n\nSo in the initial case, the work done is x units. So:\n\nx units = x men \u00d7 x hours/day \u00d7 x days.\n\nWait, let me plug in the numbers. x = x * x * x? That would be x^3. But that's not matching because x units equals x^3? Hmm, that can't be right. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the problem says x men working x hours a day can do x units in x days. So the initial work is x units. Let me compute the work done using the formula:\n\nWork = Men \u00d7 Hours per day \u00d7 Days.\n\nSo initial work = x = x * x * x. So x = x^3? That would imply x^3 = x, which only holds if x is 0 or 1. But that doesn't make sense for a real-world problem. Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I need to find the rate at which work is done. Like, how much work one man can do in one hour. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me define the work rate as the amount of work one man can do in one hour. So, if x men working x hours a day for x days produce x units, then the total man-hours is x * x * x = x^3. So the work done is x units. So the work per man-hour is x units / x^3 man-hours. That simplifies to 1/x^2 units per man-hour.\n\nWait, no. Wait, x units of work were done with x^3 man-hours. So the work per man-hour is x / x^3 = 1/x\u00b2. So each man-hour contributes 1/x\u00b2 units of work.\n\nNow, the question is, how much work can y men do in y days, working y hours per day? So the total man-hours for this scenario is y men * y hours/day * y days. That's y^3 man-hours.\n\nEach man-hour gives 1/x\u00b2 units of work. So total work done is y^3 * (1/x\u00b2) = y\u00b3 / x\u00b2.\n\nSo the work done is y\u00b3 divided by x squared.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is y\u00b3/x\u00b2. So the answer should be option B.\n\nWait, let me double-check. So initial setup: x men, x hours, x days give x units. So work done is x.\n\nWork = men * hours/day * days * (work rate per man-hour).\n\nSo, x = x * x * x * (work rate). So work rate is x / (x^3) = 1/x\u00b2.\n\nThen, for the new scenario: y men, y hours, y days. So man-hours are y*y*y = y^3. So work done is y^3 * (1/x\u00b2) = y\u00b3 / x\u00b2. Which is option B.

      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. I have this problem about work, men, hours, and days. Hmm. So, the question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nAlright, the initial statement says: x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days. I need to find out how much work y men working y hours per day can do in y days.\n\nWait, so the initial scenario is all x's. Let me think about how work is calculated. I remember that work is usually calculated as the number of workers multiplied by the time they spend working. But time itself is in days, so maybe I should convert that into hours?\n\nOh right, because the hours per day are given. So the formula for work should be something like:\n\nWork = Number of Men \u00d7 Number of Hours per Day \u00d7 Number of Days.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. The basic work formula is Work = Men \u00d7 Time. But Time here is in days, so each day they work a certain number of hours. So the total time would be the number of days multiplied by the number of hours per day. So maybe the formula is:\n\nWork = Men \u00d7 (Hours per Day \u00d7 Days)\n\nWhich can also be written as Work = Men \u00d7 Hours \u00d7 Days.\n\nSo in the initial case, the work done is x units. So:\n\nx units = x men \u00d7 x hours/day \u00d7 x days.\n\nWait, let me plug in the numbers. x = x * x * x? That would be x^3. But that's not matching because x units equals x^3? Hmm, that can't be right. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the problem says x men working x hours a day can do x units in x days. So the initial work is x units. Let me compute the work done using the formula:\n\nWork = Men \u00d7 Hours per day \u00d7 Days.\n\nSo initial work = x = x * x * x. So x = x^3? That would imply x^3 = x, which only holds if x is 0 or 1. But that doesn't make sense for a real-world problem. Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I need to find the rate at which work is done. Like, how much work one man can do in one hour. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me define the work rate as the amount of work one man can do in one hour. So, if x men working x hours a day for x days produce x units, then the total man-hours is x * x * x = x^3. So the work done is x units. So the work per man-hour is x units / x^3 man-hours. That simplifies to 1/x^2 units per man-hour.\n\nWait, no. Wait, x units of work were done with x^3 man-hours. So the work per man-hour is x / x^3 = 1/x\u00b2. So each man-hour contributes 1/x\u00b2 units of work.\n\nNow, the question is, how much work can y men do in y days, working y hours per day? So the total man-hours for this scenario is y men * y hours/day * y days. That's y^3 man-hours.\n\nEach man-hour gives 1/x\u00b2 units of work. So total work done is y^3 * (1/x\u00b2) = y\u00b3 / x\u00b2.\n\nSo the work done is y\u00b3 divided by x squared.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is y\u00b3/x\u00b2. So the answer should be option B.\n\nWait, let me double-check. So initial setup: x men, x hours, x days give x units. So work done is x.\n\nWork = men * hours/day * days * (work rate per man-hour).\n\nSo, x = x * x * x * (work rate). So work rate is x / (x^3) = 1/x\u00b2.\n\nThen, for the new scenario: y men, y hours, y days. So man-hours are y*y*y = y^3. So work done is y^3 * (1/x\u00b2) = y\u00b3 / x\u00b2. Which is option B. Yep, that makes sense.\n\n\nThe problem involves calculating the amount of work completed by y men working y hours per day in y days, given that x men working x hours per day can complete x units of work in x days. \n\nTo solve this, we first determine the work rate. The total man-hours in the initial scenario is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total man-hours} = x \\, \\text{men} \\times x \\, \\text{hours/day} \\times x \\, \\text{days} = x^3 \\, \\text{man-hours}.\n\\]\n\nThe work done in this scenario is x units, so the work rate per man-hour is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Work rate} = \\frac{\\text{Work done}}{\\text{Total man-hours}} = \\frac{x}{x^3} = \\frac{1}{x^2} \\, \\text{units/man-hour}.\n\\]\n\nFor the new scenario, the total man-hours is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total man-hours} = y \\, \\text{men} \\times y \\, \\text{hours/day} \\times y \\, \\text{days} = y^3 \\, \\text{man-hours}.\n\\]\n\nUsing the work rate calculated earlier, the total work completed in the new scenario is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Work done} = \\text{Total man-hours} \\times \\text{Work rate} = y^3 \\times \\frac{1}{x^2} = \\frac{y^3}{x^2}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the amount of work completed is \\( \\frac{y^3}{x^2} \\), which corresponds to option B.\n\nAnswer: B",

So the total man-hours would be x * x * x = x^3 man-hours. And this results in x units of work.\n\nSo the amount of work per man-hour would be x units / x^3 man-hours.

So total man-hours here would be y * y * y = y\u00b3.\n\nSince each man-hour is 1/x\u00b2 units, the total work done in this case would be (y\u00b3) * (1/x\u00b2) units.

And the question is, how much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days? The options are given as A to E.\n\nWait, so I need to find the work done when all these variables change.

But in this problem, I don't know if the efficiency changes. Oh wait, probably the efficiency per man per hour is constant, so we can treat it as a proportionality.\n\nLet me start by figuring out the work rate. Let's denote the work done as W. So W is proportional to the number of men (M), multiplied by the number of hours per day (H), multiplied by the number of days (D). So W = M * H * D * k, where k is a constant of proportionality.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the initial condition is x men, x hours, x days, producing x units of work. So plugging in, x = x * x * x * k. That simplifies to x = x\u00b3 * k. So solving for k, we get k = x / x\u00b3 = 1/x\u00b2.\n\nSo the general formula for work W would be W = M * H * D * (1/x\u00b2). Because k is 1/x\u00b2.\n\nNow, the second scenario is y men, y hours per day, y days. So substituting into the formula, W = y * y * y * (1/x\u00b2) = y\u00b3 / x\u00b2.\n\nWait, so the work done would be y\u00b3 divided by x squared. Let me check the options.

Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days. Then it asks how much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days. The options are given as A to E.\n\nHmm, I remember that these types of problems involve work, time, and the number of workers. So probably, it's a problem involving man-hours or something similar. Let me think about the basics.\n\nFirst, I'll try to break down the given information. So initially, we have x men working x hours a day for x days to complete x units of work. I need to find the work done when the numbers change to y in each category.\n\nLet me write down the initial scenario:\n\nMen = x\nHours per day = x\nDays = x\nWork done = x units\n\nI think the formula that relates these variables is the concept of man-days or man-hours. The total work can be thought of as the number of workers multiplied by the number of hours they work each day multiplied by the number of days they work. So the formula is:\n\nTotal Work = Men \u00d7 Hours per day \u00d7 Days\n\nBut wait, wait. Because in the problem, the work done is given as x units. So according to this, the total work in man-hours (or whatever unit) would be x \u00d7 x \u00d7 x, which is x^3.\n\nSo, x^3 = x units of work. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the units here might not be directly additive. Maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should find the rate at which work is done. Let's think in terms of how much work one man can do in one hour. That might be a better approach.\n\nSo, the initial setup is x men working x hours a day for x days to complete x units of work. Let me find the work done per man per hour.\n\nThe total man-hours in the initial scenario is x (men) multiplied by x (hours/day) multiplied by x (days) = x^3 man-hours. And this produces x units of work.\n\nSo, the work per man-hour is x units / x^3 man-hours. That simplifies to 1/(x\u00b2) units per man-hour.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So each man-hour contributes 1/x\u00b2 units of work.\n\nNow, the second scenario is y men working y hours per day for y days. The total man-hours here would be y \u00d7 y \u00d7 y = y^3.\n\nSince each man-hour gives 1/x\u00b2 units, the total work done in this scenario would be (y^3) \u00d7 (1/x\u00b2) = y\u00b3 / x\u00b2 units.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is y\u00b3 / x\u00b2. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Let me go through the reasoning again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSo, initial work: x units.\n\nInitial man-hours: x * x * x = x\u00b3.\n\nSo work per man-hour = x / x\u00b3 = 1/x\u00b2.\n\nSecond case: man-hours = y * y * y = y\u00b3.\n\nTotal work = y\u00b3 * (1/x\u00b2) = y\u00b3 / x\u00b2. Which is option B.\n\nHmm, but I just thought of another way to approach this using proportions. Let me try that.\n\nWork is directly proportional to the number of men, the number of hours they work each day, and the number of days they work. So, if all these factors change, the work done will change accordingly.\n\nSo, the initial work is x units with x men, x hours/day, x days.\n\nThe new work W can be found by:\n\nW = x * (y/x) * (y/x) * (y/x)\n\nWait, because each of the three variables (men, hours, days) is changing from x to y. So each term is multiplied by (y/x).\n\nWait, that would give W = x * (y/x) * (y/x) * (y/x) = x * (y^3)/(x^3) )= (y^3)/(x^2) * x. Wait, no. Wait, that would be x * (y^3)/(x^3) ) = y^3/(x^2) * x/(x) ? No, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me think again. The formula for work is Work = Men \u00d7 Hours/Day \u00d7 Days \u00d7 (original work). Or maybe it's proportional. Let me think in terms of ratios.\n\nThe original work is x units, done by x men, x hours/day, x days.\n\nThe new work W is done by y men, y hours/day, y days.\n\nSo, the ratio of the new work to the original work is:\n\nW/x = (y/x) * (y/x) * (y/x) = (y^3)/(x^3)\n\nWait, that's because each factor (men, hours, days) is scaled by y/x. So the new work is (y^3 / x^3) * x units, since the original was x.\n\nSo W = x * (y^3)/(x^3) ) = y^3 / x^2.\n\nYes, that matches what I got earlier. So the answer is B.\n",

Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe problem states: x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days. We need to find out how much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days.\n\nHmm, I remember that work problems often involve the concept of man-hours or something like that. So maybe I should break it down into those terms.\n\nWait, man-hours. Right, man-hours is the amount of work one person can do in an hour. So if you have more men or more hours, you can do more work.\n\nLet me start by figuring out the total work done in the first scenario. So, we have x men working x hours a day for x days. The total man-hours would be x (men) multiplied by x (hours per day) multiplied by x (days). So that's x * x * x = x\u00b3 man-hours. And this amount of work produces x units of work. Wait, no, wait. The problem says they do x units of work. So, x\u00b3 man-hours equals x units of work.\n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Oh, wait, no. The total work done is x units, so x\u00b3 man-hours equals x units. So to find how much work a single man-hour contributes, I can divide x units by x\u00b3 man-hours. That would give me x / x\u00b3 = 1/x\u00b2 units per man-hour. So each man-hour contributes 1/x\u00b2 units of work.\n\nNow, the second scenario: y men working y hours a day for y days. Let me calculate the total man-hours here. It's y * y * y = y\u00b3 man-hours.\n\nSince each man-hour gives 1/x\u00b2 units, the total work done in the second case would be y\u00b3 * (1/x\u00b2) units. Which is y\u00b3 / x\u00b2, or y\u00b3 divided by x squared.\n\nWait, looking at the options, option B is y\u00b3/x\u00b2. So that's probably the answer. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait another way: Maybe I should think in terms of proportions. Let's see.\n\nThe original work is x units done by x men in x days working x hours daily. So the rate is work per man per hour per day? Or maybe I should find the work rate per man.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula: Work = Men \u00d7 Time \u00d7 Rate.\n\nWait, the formula I remember is Work = Number of workers \u00d7 Time \u00d7 Rate. But the time here is in days, and hours per day. So perhaps the time needs to be in hours.\n\nSo the first scenario: Work = x \u00d7 (x hours/day \u00d7 x days) \u00d7 rate per man per hour.\n\nWait, let's see. Work is x units. Men is x. Time per day is x hours, over x days. So total time is x * x = x\u00b2 hours.\n\nSo x units = x (men) * x\u00b2 (hours) * rate. So rate = x / (x * x\u00b2) = x / x\u00b3 = 1/x\u00b2 units per man-hour. That's the same as before.\n\nThen, for the second scenario: Men = y, time per day = y hours, days = y. So total hours = y * y = y\u00b2.\n\nWork done = y (men) * y\u00b2 (hours) * (1/x\u00b2) (rate) = y\u00b3 / x\u00b2 units. So yeah, that's option B.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is y\u00b3/x\u00b2. So that's correct. So the answer should be B.\n\nBut wait, let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA) x\u00b2/y\u00b2\nB) y\u00b3/x\u00b2\nC) x\u00b3/y\u00b2\nD) y\u00b2/x\u00b2\nE) None of these.\n\nSo yes, B is y\u00b3/x\u00b2, which matches our calculation.

Let me calculate the total man-hours here. It's y * y * y = y\u00b3 man-hours.\n\nSince each man-hour gives 1/x\u00b2 units, the total work done in the second case would be y\u00b3 * (1/x\u00b2) units.

So perhaps the time needs to be in hours.\n\nSo the first scenario: Work = x \u00d7 (x hours/day \u00d7 x days) \u00d7 rate per man per hour.\n\nWait, let's see. Work is x units. Men is x. Time per day is x hours, over x days. So total time is x * x = x\u00b2 hours.\n\nSo x units = x (men) * x\u00b2 (hours) * rate.

How much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days?\n\nHmm, that's a bit repetitive with all the x's and y's, but I think it's a work-rate problem. I remember that work problems usually involve finding how much work is done based on the number of workers, time, and rates.\n\nSo, the standard formula I remember is Work = Rate \u00d7 Time \u00d7 Number of Workers. Or maybe it's Work = Men \u00d7 Hours \u00d7 Days, but I think the rate matters too. Wait, another formula is Work = Men \u00d7 Time \u00d7 Rate. Or perhaps it's better to think in terms of man-hours or something.\n\nWait, let me think. The basic idea is that the amount of work done is proportional to the number of men, the number of hours they work each day, and the number of days they work. So if you increase any of these, the work increases, and vice versa.\n\nLet me parse the given information. We have x men working x hours a day, completing x units in x days. So, Work = x units when Men = x, Hours per day = x, Days = x.\n\nWait, so Work = Men \u00d7 Hours/day \u00d7 Days. So substituting the given values: x units = x \u00d7 x \u00d7 x? That would mean x = x^3, which is only true if x is 1 or 0. But that's not helpful. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the work is x units, but the way it's phrased might be different. Maybe it's x units of work, so the work done is x units when the other variables are x. So the formula is Work = (Men \u00d7 Hours per day \u00d7 Days) \u00d7 rate per man-hour? Or perhaps Work = (Men \u00d7 Hours \u00d7 Days) \u00d7 (rate).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rate is such that each man works at a certain rate. Let's think about it. Let's denote the work rate as r units per man-hour. So, the total work done is (number of men) \u00d7 (hours per day) \u00d7 (number of days) \u00d7 r.\n\nSo, given that, in the first case, the work is x units. So x = x * x * x * r. Wait, that can't be right because that would imply r = x / (x^3) = 1/x\u00b2. Hmm, that seems possible.\n\nWait, let me write this out more carefully. Let's denote:\n\nWork (W) = Number of Men (M) \u00d7 Number of Hours per Day (H) \u00d7 Number of Days (D) \u00d7 Rate per man-hour (r).\n\nSo, in the first scenario:\n\nW1 = x units = M1 * H1 * D1 * r.\n\nWhere M1 = x, H1 = x, D1 = x.\n\nSo,\n\nx = x * x * x * r \u2192 x = x\u00b3 r \u2192 r = x / x\u00b3 = 1/x\u00b2.\n\nSo the rate r is 1/x\u00b2 units per man-hour.\n\nNow, the question is, what's the work W2 done when M2 = y, H2 = y, D2 = y.\n\nSo W2 = M2 * H2 * D2 * r.\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\nW2 = y * y * y * (1/x\u00b2) = y\u00b3 / x\u00b2.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is y\u00b3/x\u00b2, which matches.\n\nSo the answer should be option B.\n",
