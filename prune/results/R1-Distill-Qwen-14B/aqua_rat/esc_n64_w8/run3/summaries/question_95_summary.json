      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it says.\n\nThe question is about a newspaper cost and a hotel ordering. Hmm, right. The newspaper costs $4 on Sundays and $1 the rest of the days. The hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday compared to the other days. And the total they pay per week is $210. The question is asking how many newspapers they buy on Monday.\n\nAlright, so let's break it down. First, I need to figure out how many newspapers are bought each day, and then calculate the cost accordingly.\n\nLet me think. Let's say the hotel buys 'x' newspapers on each of the non-Sunday days. Since Sunday is twice as much, that would be 2x on Sunday.\n\nWait, how many days are non-Sundays? There are 6 other days (Monday to Saturday). So each of those 6 days has x newspapers, and Sunday has 2x.\n\nNow, the cost per day varies. On Sunday, each paper is $4, so the cost for Sunday would be 2x * $4. For the other days, each paper is $1, so each day's cost is x * $1. Since there are 6 other days, the total cost for those days is 6 * (x * 1).\n\nSo the total weekly cost would be the sum of Sunday's cost and the rest of the days' cost. Let me write that as an equation.\n\nTotal cost = (Sunday cost) + (other days cost)\n$210 = (2x * 4) + (6 * x * 1)\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nSunday cost: 2x *4 = 8x\nOther days cost: 6 *x *1 =6x\nSo total is 8x +6x =14x\n\nSo 14x =210\n\nWait, solving for x: x = 210 /14 =15.\n\nSo x is 15. That means on each of the other days, the hotel buys 15 newspapers. So Monday is one of those days, right?\n\nSo the answer should be 15 newspapers on Monday. Looking at the options, option A is 15.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my math. Because sometimes when I do quick calculations, I might make a mistake.\n\nSo, 2x on Sunday. Each Sunday paper is $4, so 2x *4=8x. The other 6 days, x each, each at $1. So 6x. Total is 8x +6x=14x. 14x=210. So x=210/14=15. Yep, that's correct. So Monday's papers are 15. So the answer is A)15.\n",

Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says the newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days. The hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as on the other days. They pay a total of $210 per week. I need to find out how many newspapers they buy on Monday.\n\nHmm, wait. So the days are Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. So Sunday is one day, and the rest are six days. But the problem says the hotel orders twice as many on Sunday as on the other days. Wait, does that mean twice as many as each of the other days, or twice the total of the other days?\n\nLet me read that again. \"Twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" Oh, so Sunday's order is twice the number they order on any other day. So if on Monday they buy x papers, Sunday they buy 2x. Because each of the other days is x, Sunday is 2x.\n\nWait no, maybe not. Let me clarify. The way it's phrased: the hotel orders twice as many on Sunday as it does the rest of the days. So perhaps \"the rest of the days\" refers to the total for all the other days combined. Or maybe each day. Hmm, that could change the problem.\n\nWait, if the rest of the days are six days, and the hotel buys the same number each day, then Sunday is twice that. Or perhaps each day is same, and Sunday is twice as any one of them. Or maybe each of the other days is the same, and Sunday is twice that.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the hotel buys twice as many on Sunday as it does on each of the other days. So if on Monday, Tuesday, etc., it's x each, then Sunday is 2x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the hotel buys twice as many on Sunday compared to all the other days combined. So if the other days sum to y, then Sunday is 2y. But that's a different scenario.\n\nI think the wording is \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" So the rest of the days would be the other six days, but perhaps \"rest of the days\" is interpreted as each of the other days.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem says: \"the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" So \"the rest of the days\" would be Monday to Saturday, which are six days. So does that mean that Sunday's order is twice the total of Monday to Saturday, or twice the number per day?\n\nHmm, this is a bit ambiguous. But let me try to parse the grammar. \"Twice as many as it does the rest of the days.\" So, the way it's phrased, it's comparing Sunday's order to the rest of the days. So perhaps it's twice the number per day. Or maybe the rest of the days are considered as a group.\n\nWait, another approach: if the hotel buys the same number each day on the other days, then Sunday is twice that. Let's model this.\n\nLet me define variables. Let me let x be the number of newspapers bought on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. So each of these days, the hotel buys x newspapers. Then, on Sunday, they buy twice that, so 2x newspapers.\n\nNow, the cost. Each day except Sunday, each paper costs $1, so the cost per day is x * $1 = $x. On Sunday, each paper is $4, so the cost is 2x * $4 = $8x.\n\nNow, how many days? Sunday is one day, and the other days are six days. So the total cost is:\n\n6 days * $x + 1 day * $8x = 6x + 8x = 14x.\n\nWait, no. Wait, wait. Let me correct that. Each day from Monday to Saturday is x newspapers, so the cost for each of those days is x * $1. So for six days, it's 6 * x * $1 = $6x. On Sunday, it's 2x newspapers at $4 each, so 2x *4 = $8x. So the total cost per week is 6x + 8x = 14x.\n\nBut the problem says the total cost is $210. So 14x = 210. Solving for x: x = 210 /14 = 15. So x is 15. So each of the other days, they buy 15 newspapers. So on Monday, they buy 15 newspapers. So the answer would be option A)15.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the setup. Because I'm assuming that the other days each have x newspapers, and Sunday has 2x. But perhaps the problem is that the hotel buys twice as many on Sunday as on all the other days combined.\n\nWait, if that's the case, then the other six days total y newspapers. Then Sunday is 2y. Then the cost would be:\n\nThe cost for the other six days is y * $1 each, so y *1 *6? Wait, no. Wait, each newspaper on other days is $1, so the cost for the other six days is y * $1. Wait, no, wait. If the other days have y newspapers in total, then cost is y * $1.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. If the hotel buys a total of y newspapers on the other six days, then each newspaper is $1, so the cost is y * $1 = $y.\n\nOn Sunday, they buy 2y newspapers at $4 each, so cost is 2y *4 = $8y.\n\nTotal cost is y +8y =9y. The total cost is $210, so 9y =210 \u2192 y=210/9=23.333... That can't be right because newspapers are in whole numbers. So this suggests that the initial interpretation is wrong.\n\nSo perhaps the first approach is correct, where each of the other days is x, Sunday is 2x, and the cost per day is $1 except Sunday which is $4.\n\nSo, with that, I think the first approach is correct, leading to x=15. So the answer is 15, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" So, if the rest of the days are 6 days, and the hotel buys x each day, then the rest of the days total 6x. So Sunday would be 2*(6x) =12x. So that would be a different setup.\n\nWait, that's a different scenario. So in this case, the rest of the days (Monday to Saturday) sum up to 6x, and Sunday is twice that, 12x.\n\nSo then, the cost for the other days: each is x newspapers, each $1, so 6x * $1 = $6x. Sunday: 12x newspapers at $4 each: 12x *4=48x. So total cost is 6x +48x=54x. Given that total is $210, 54x=210 \u2192 x=210/54 \u22483.888. That's not a whole number either, which is a problem because you can't buy a fraction of a newspaper.\n\nHmm, that suggests that this interpretation might not be correct. So perhaps my initial approach is the right one, where Sunday is twice the number of each of the other days, not twice the sum.\n\nSo, in that case, each of the other days is x, Sunday is 2x. So the total newspapers on other days: 6x. Sunday: 2x. So the cost for other days: 6x * $1 = $6x. Sunday: 2x * $4 = $8x. Total cost: 6x +8x=14x=210 \u2192 x=15. So that works, and x is 15.\n\nSo on Monday, they buy x=15 newspapers. So the answer is A)15.\n",

Then, on Sunday, it's twice that, so 2*(6x) = 12x?\n\nWait, no, wait. Alternatively, maybe the hotel buys twice as many on Sunday as on a single non-Sunday day. So, if on each of the other days, they buy x, then on Sunday they buy 2x. So, total for the week would be: 6 days of x each, plus one day of 2x. So total papers would be 6x + 2x = 8x. But the cost would be different because Sunday's papers are more expensive.\n\nLet me rephrase the problem with variables. Let me denote:\n\nLet x = number of newspapers bought on a non-Sunday day (so each day, x papers).\n\nThen, on Sunday, they buy twice as many as the rest of the days. Wait, \"twice as many as the rest of the days\"\u2014does that mean Sunday is twice the total of the rest, or twice each day?\n\nWait, the wording is a bit unclear. Let me think again. The problem says, \"the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" So, \"rest of the days\" could be interpreted as the total for all the other days.\n\nSo, if the hotel buys x papers on each of the 6 days, the total for the week would be 6x. Then, on Sunday, they buy twice that total, which would be 2*(6x) = 12x. So, Sunday's papers are 12x.\n\nBut wait, that would make Sunday's count 12x, and the other days 6x. So total newspapers per week would be 12x + 6x = 18x. But let's think about the cost.\n\nEach Sunday paper is $4, so cost for Sunday is 12x * $4 = $48x.\n\nEach other day's paper is $1, so cost for other days is 6x * $1 = $6x.\n\nTotal weekly cost is $48x + $6x = $54x.\n\nBut the hotel pays $210 per week. So, 54x = 210. Then x would be 210 / 54. Let me compute that.\n\n210 divided by 54. Hmm, 54 times 3 is 162, 54 times 3.888... is 210. Let me compute 210/54. 54 * 3 = 162, 210-162=48. So 48/54 is 8/9. So x is 3 and 8/9, which is about 3.888. But that can't be, since the number of newspapers should be whole numbers. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the interpretation is different. Maybe \"twice as many on Sunday as on each of the other days.\" So, each non-Sunday day is x, Sunday is 2x. So, Sunday is twice as much as a single day.\n\nIn this case, the number of newspapers bought on Sunday is 2x. The other days are 6 days, each x. So total newspapers per week are 6x + 2x = 8x.\n\nNow, cost calculation:\n\nSunday: 2x papers * $4 = $8x.\n\nOther days: 6x papers * $1 = $6x.\n\nTotal cost: 8x + 6x = $14x.\n\nBut the total cost is $210, so 14x = 210 \u2192 x = 15.\n\nSo, x is 15. That would mean on each non-Sunday day, the hotel buys 15 newspapers. So on Monday, they buy 15 newspapers. Looking at the options, option A is 15.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check. So, Sunday is 2x, which is 30 newspapers. Each other day is 15. So, Sunday: 30, Monday:15, etc. \n\nTotal cost: 30 *4 = $120 for Sunday.\n\nOther days: 6 days *15 =90 newspapers. 90 *1=90.\n\nTotal cost: 120 +90 = 210. Perfect, that adds up.\n\nSo the correct answer is 15, which is option A.\n",

That means on each non-Sunday day, the hotel buys 15 newspapers.\n\nSo the question is, how many newspapers on Monday? That's x, which is 15. So the answer would be option A)15.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my reasoning. Because sometimes I might mix up the number of days.\n\nWait, let me recalculate. Let me write out the equation again.\n\nLet x = number of newspapers on each non-Sunday day.\n\nSunday: 2x newspapers.\n\nCost Sunday: 2x *4 =8x.\n\nCost non-Sundays: 6 days * x *1 =6x.\n\nTotal cost: 8x +6x=14x=210.\n\nSo 14x=210 \u2192 x=15.\n\nYes, so Monday is x=15. So the answer is 15, which is option A.\n\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of newspapers the hotel buys on each non-Sunday day. On Sunday, the hotel buys twice as many newspapers, so it buys \\( 2x \\) newspapers on Sunday.\n\nThe cost of newspapers on non-Sunday days is \\( x \\times \\$1 = \\$x \\) per day. Since there are 6 non-Sunday days (Monday to Saturday), the total cost for non-Sunday newspapers is \\( 6 \\times x \\times \\$1 = 6x \\).\n\nOn Sunday, the cost of newspapers is \\( 2x \\times \\$4 = \\$8x \\). Therefore, the total weekly cost for newspapers is:\n\n\\[\n6x + 8x = 14x\n\\]\n\nThe problem states that the total weekly cost is \\$210. Thus:\n\n\\[\n14x = 210\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{210}{14} = 15\n\\]\n\nSince \\( x \\) represents the number of newspapers bought on each non-Sunday day, the hotel buys 15 newspapers on Monday.\n\n**Answer: A**",

I need to find out how many newspapers they buy on Monday.\n\nWait, so the newspaper price varies by day. Sunday is $4, and Monday to Saturday (I guess) are $1 each. The hotel orders more on Sunday. Let me think about variables to represent the quantities.\n\nLet me denote the number of newspapers bought on a non-Sunday day as 'x'. Since Sunday they buy twice as many, that would be '2x'.
