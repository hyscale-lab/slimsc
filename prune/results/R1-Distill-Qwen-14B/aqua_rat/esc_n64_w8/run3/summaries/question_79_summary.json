      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about averages and a heavy duty truck. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on averages, but I'll take it slow.\n\nThe question says the average weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. Then, when a new truck is added, the average increases by 2.6 tons. I need to find the weight of that truck.\n\nHmm, averages. Right, the average is the total divided by the number. So initially, the average is 12.2 tons for 10 vehicles. That means the total weight of those 10 vehicles is average multiplied by the number. Let me write that down.\n\nTotal initial weight = average * number = 12.2 * 10. Let me calculate that. 12.2 times 10 is 122 tons. So the initial total is 122 tons.\n\nThen, a new truck is added. So now there are 11 vehicles. The average increases by 2.6 tons. So the new average is 12.2 + 2.6. Let me add those: 12.2 plus 2.6 is... 14.8 tons. So the new average is 14.8 tons for 11 vehicles.\n\nThe total weight after adding the truck would be new average multiplied by 11. Let me compute that. 14.8 * 11. Hmm, 14 times 11 is 154, and 0.8 times 11 is 8.8. So 154 + 8.8 = 162.8 tons. Wait, wait, no, I think I did that wrong. Oh wait, 14.8 * 11 is the same as (14 + 0.8) * 11 = (14*11) + (0.8*11) = 154 + 8.8 = 162.8. Yeah, that's right.\n\nSo the total after adding the truck is 162.8 tons. The initial total was 122 tons. So the weight of the truck must be the difference between these two totals.\n\nTruck weight = new total - old total = 162.8 - 122. Let me subtract. 162.8 minus 122. Well, 162 minus 122 is 40, and 0.8 remains. So 40.8 tons. So the truck is 40.8 tons.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 40.8. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nInitial average: 12.2, 10 vehicles. So 12.2 *10=122. Correct.\n\nAfter adding a truck, 11 vehicles. New average is 12.2 +2.6=14.8. Correct.\n\n14.8 *11: Let me calculate that again. 14 *11 is 154, 0.8 *11 is 8.8, so 154 +8.8 is 162.8. So total is 162.8. Correct.\n\nTruck weight: 162.8 - 122 =40.8. Yes, that's correct. So the answer is A.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about averages and trucks. Hmm, let me see. Let's try to break it down.\n\nAlright, the problem says that the average weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. So, I remember that the average is the total divided by the number. So, to find the total weight of these 10 vehicles, I can multiply the average by the number of vehicles. Let me calculate that. 12.2 tons multiplied by 10. Oh right, 12.2 *10 is 122 tons. So the total weight before adding the truck is 122 tons.\n\nThen, a new heavy duty truck is added, and the average increases by 2.6 tons. Wait, so the new average is 12.2 + 2.6. Let me add those: 12.2 plus 2.6 is 14.8 tons. So now the average is 14.8 tons.\n\nBut now there are 11 vehicles because we added one more. So the total weight for these 11 vehicles is the new average multiplied by 11. Let me compute that. 14.8 times 11... Hmm, 14 times 11 is 154, and 0.8 times 11 is 8.8, so adding them gives 154 +8.8 = 162.8 tons. So the new total is 162.8 tons.\n\nWait, but the original total was 122 tons, right? So the weight of the new truck must be the difference between the new total and the old total. So 162.8 minus 122. Let me do that subtraction. 162.8 minus 122 is 40.8 tons. Hmm, so the truck is 40.8 tons.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 40.8. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I make mistakes in arithmetic.\n\nSo original average: 12.2 tons for 10 vehicles. 12.2 *10 = 122. That's correct. Then new average is 12.2 +2.6 =14.8. 14.8 *11: Let's compute that again. 14 *11 is 154, 0.8 *11 is 8.8, total 162.8. So yes, new total is 162.8. Subtracting 122 gives 40.8. So the truck is 40.8 tons, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Did I account for all the numbers correctly? Another way to approach this might be to consider how much the total increased. The average went up by 2.6 tons for 11 vehicles. So the total increase in weight would be 2.6 tons *11 vehicles, which is 28.6 tons. Because each of the 11 vehicles contributes an extra 2.6 tons to the average. So the new truck must have added enough weight to not only cover that increase but also add to the previous total. Alternatively, the total increase is the new truck's weight minus the average of the new group. Wait, no, maybe I should think of it another way.\n\nWait, the initial total is 122. After adding the truck, the total is 162.8, so the truck is 162.8-122=40.8. So yeah, that seems right. So the answer should be A)40.8. But wait, looking at the options, B is 41.6. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me compute 14.8 multiplied by 11 again. Let me do it step by step. 14 *11 is 154, and 0.8 *11 is 8.8. 154 +8.8 is 162.8. So that's correct. 122 +40.8 =162.8. So the truck is 40.8, which is option A. So why is option B 41.6? Maybe I messed up somewhere.\n\nWait another approach: the increase in total weight is the new truck's weight minus the average of the new group. Because when you add a new element, the change in total is equal to the new element minus the original average times the number of new elements. Hmm, no, maybe not exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as:\n\nLet T be the total before adding the truck: T = 10 *12.2 =122.\n\nAfter adding the truck, the new total is T + W, where W is the truck's weight. The new average is (T + W)/(10 +1) = (122 + W)/11.\n\nThis new average is 12.2 + 2.6 =14.8. So,\n\n(122 + W)/11 =14.8\n\nMultiply both sides by 11:\n\n122 + W = 14.8 *11\n\n14.8 *11: let me compute that again. 14*11=154, 0.8*11=8.8, so 154 +8.8=162.8.\n\nSo 122 + W =162.8.\n\nSo W=162.8 -122=40.8. So yeah, 40.8 is correct, which is option A.\n\nSo why is option B 41.6? Maybe I made a mistake in the initial average calculation. Wait, 12.2 is the average for 10 vehicles. 12.2*10=122. That's correct.\n\nAnother way: the increase in average is 2.6 tons. So each of the 11 vehicles now has an average that's 2.6 higher. So the total increase is 11*2.6=28.6. So the truck must have added 28.6 more than the previous average of 12.2. So the truck's weight is 12.2 +28.6=40.8. That's the same answer.\n\nSo the correct answer is A)40.8.\n",

Hmm, let me compute that again. 14.8 times 10 is 148, and 14.8 times 1 is 14.8. So 148 +14.8= 162.8. Yes, that's correct. So 162.8 minus 122 is 40.8 tons. So the truck is 40.8 tons. But wait, looking at the options, option A is 40.8. So that's the answer? Or did I make a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait another thought: When I added 12.2 + 2.6, I got 14.8, correct. But wait, the average increased by 2.6, so the new average is 12.2 + 2.6 =14.8, which I think is right. So the total after adding is 14.8 *11=162.8. Subtract original total 122, so 40.8. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option A is 40.8. So that's the answer.\n\n\nThe average weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons, so the total weight of the vehicles is:\n\n\\[\n10 \\times 12.2 = 122 \\, \\text{tons}.\n\\]\n\nWhen a new heavy-duty truck is added, the average weight increases by 2.6 tons, making the new average:\n\n\\[\n12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 \\, \\text{tons}.\n\\]\n\nWith 11 vehicles, the total weight is now:\n\n\\[\n11 \\times 14.8 = 162.8 \\, \\text{tons}.\n\\]\n\nThe weight of the truck is the difference between the new total and the original total:\n\n\\[\n162.8 - 122 = 40.8 \\, \\text{tons}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the weight of the heavy-duty truck is **40.8 tons**, which corresponds to option A.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about averages and adding a new truck. Hmm, let's see. I'll try to work through it step by step.\n\nThe problem says that the average weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. So, average is total divided by the number, right? So to find the total weight of these 10 vehicles, I can multiply the average by the number of vehicles.\n\nLet me write that down. Total weight = average \u00d7 number. So that's 12.2 tons \u00d7 10 vehicles. Let me calculate that. 12.2 *10 is 122 tons. Okay, so the total weight of the 10 vehicles is 122 tons.\n\nNow, when a new heavy duty truck is added, the average increases by 2.6 tons. So the new average is 12.2 + 2.6. Let me add that up. 12.2 plus 2.6 is 14.8 tons. So the new average is 14.8 tons.\n\nWait, how many vehicles are there now? Initially, there were 10, and we added one more. So now there are 11 vehicles. So the new total weight is the new average multiplied by 11. Let me compute that. 14.8 * 11. Hmm, 14.8 * 10 is 148, and 14.8 *1 is 14.8, so 148 +14.8= 162.8 tons. So the total after adding the truck is 162.8 tons.\n\nBut wait, the total before adding the truck was 122 tons. So the weight of the new truck must be the difference between the new total and the old total. So 162.8 - 122 = ?\n\nLet me subtract that. 162.8 minus 122. Hmm, 122 is 120 +2. 162.8 minus 120 is 42.8, then minus 2 is 40.8. Oh wait, wait, no, wait: 162.8 minus 122. Let me do it properly.\n\n122.000\n-162.800\nWait no, wait, wait, the initial total was 122, new is 162.8. So 162.8 -122 = 40.8? Wait, no, wait, 122 + 40.8 = 162.8? Let me check: 122 +40 is 162, plus 0.8 is 162.8. Oh, right. So the truck's weight is 40.8 tons. \n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option A is 40.8. So that's one of the choices. Hmm. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when I'm doing this in my head, I might mix up the numbers.\n\nWait, initial average: 12.2, 10 vehicles, total 122. After adding a truck, average becomes 14.8 for 11 vehicles. So 14.8 *11 is 162.8. So the truck's weight is 162.8 -122 = 40.8. So that's correct. So the answer should be A)40.8.\n\nWait, but the options are:\n\nA)40.8\nB)41.6\nC)42.2\nD)43.5\nE)44.8\n\nSo the correct answer is A. Hmm. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes when adding a number that's above the average, the increase in average is based on the number of items. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. The increase in average is 2.6 tons, and this is for 11 vehicles. So the total increase is 2.6 tons multiplied by 11, which is 28.6 tons. So the new truck added must not only make up for that increase but also contribute its own weight. Wait, no, wait.\n\nWait, another way to think: The new truck added causes the average to increase. So the total increase in the sum is the increase in average multiplied by the new number of items. So the new truck's weight is equal to the original total plus this increase. So let's see:\n\nOriginal total: 122. The new total is 122 + truck's weight. The new average is 14.8, which is 12.2 +2.6.\n\nAlternatively, the total can be computed as 14.8 * 11 = 162.8. So the truck's weight is 162.8 -122 = 40.8. So yeah, same result as before.\n\nHmm, so I think the answer is A)40.8. So why am I second-guessing myself? Maybe because 40.8 seems a bit low for a heavy duty truck? But maybe in the context of the problem, it's okay.\n\nWait, another way: Let me model it using algebra. Let T be the weight of the truck. The original average is 12.2 for 10 vehicles, so total is 122. After adding T, the average becomes (122 + T)/11 = 12.2 +2.6.\n\nSo equation: (122 + T)/11 = 14.8.\n\nMultiply both sides by 11: 122 + T = 162.8.\n\nSubtract 122: T = 40.8. Yep, same as before.\n\nSo I think the correct answer is A)40.8. So why are the other options there? Let me see. Maybe if someone makes a mistake in the number of vehicles or in the average.\n\nWait, perhaps someone might think the new average is 12.2 +2.6 =14.8, but then forget to multiply by 11, and instead multiply by 10, getting 148. Then subtract 122 to get 26, but that's not one of the options. Or maybe if someone adds 2.6 to the average of 12.2, getting 14.8, and then multiplies by 10 vehicles (wrongly), 14.8 *10=148, subtract 122 gives 26. So 26 isn't an option, so that's not an issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps someone might forget that the new average is per 11 vehicles and compute T as 2.6 *11, which is 28.6, but that's not the case. Because the truck's weight is more than the increase in total, as the increase in average is spread over all vehicles.\n\nWait, no, the total increase is 2.6 *11=28.6. But the truck's weight is the sum of the previous total plus 28.6. Because when you add the truck, the total increases by T, which is the truck's weight, and that T must equal the previous total plus the increase in average times the new number of vehicles. Or wait, no, the increase in total is 28.6, so T is 28.6 plus the previous total? No, no.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The new total is 122 + T. The new average is (122 + T)/11 = 14.8. So 122 + T = 162.8. So T=40.8. So the truck adds 40.8 tons, which is 162.8 -122.\n\nWait, but the increase in the average is 2.6, so the total increase is 2.6 *11=28.6. So that 28.6 is the amount by which the total increased. So T must be equal to the previous total plus 28.6. Wait, no. Because the new total is 122 + T. But the new total is also 122 + 28.6 =150.6. Wait, that can't be right because 122 +28.6 is 150.6, but according to earlier calculation, the new total is 162.8. So where did I go wrong here?\n\nOh wait, no, that approach is wrong. Because when you add the truck, the total increases by T, not by the increase in average. The increase in average comes from that T. So the correct way is to compute the new total as 14.8*11=162.8, so T is 162.8-122=40.8.\n\nSo I think I'm confident that the correct answer is A)40.8.\n",
