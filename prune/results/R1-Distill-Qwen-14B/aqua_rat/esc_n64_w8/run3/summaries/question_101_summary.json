      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about red and green sweets in a bag. The ratio of red to green is 3:4. They told me there are 120 green sweets, and I need to find out how many red ones there are. Hmm, ratios can sometimes trip me up, but let's take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that ratios compare quantities. So 3:4 for red:green means that for every 3 red sweets, there are 4 green ones. But I need to find the number of red sweets when there are 120 green. \n\nWait, ratios can also be thought of in terms of fractions. So the ratio of red to green is 3/4. That means red is 3 parts and green is 4 parts. Or wait, no, the ratio is red:green, so 3 parts red to 4 parts green. So the total parts would be 3 +4 =7 parts. But wait, maybe I don't need the total parts here because I'm given the actual number of green sweets.\n\nLet me think. If the ratio is 3:4, then the number of red sweets is (3/4) times the number of green sweets. Because for every 4 green, there are 3 red. So if there are 120 green, then red should be (3/4)*120.\n\nWait, let me calculate that. 3 divided by 4 is 0.75. Multiply by 120: 0.75 * 120. Let's see, 100 *0.75 is 75, 20*0.75 is 15. So 75 +15 is 90. So that would make 90 red sweets.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 90. So that's the answer. But wait, maybe I should double-check. Another way to think about it: since the ratio is 3:4, the number of green sweets is 4 parts. If 4 parts equal 120, then each part is 120/4 =30. So each part is 30. Then red sweets are 3 parts, so 3*30=90. Yep, same answer. So I'm confident it's A)90.\n",

I need to find out how many red sweets there are. Hmm, ratios can sometimes trip me up, but let's see.\n\nWait, the ratio is 3 red to 4 green. So for every 3 red sweets, there are 4 green ones. That makes sense. So if I think of it as parts, red is 3 parts and green is 4 parts. \n\nThe problem states there are 120 green sweets. So the number of green sweets is part of the ratio. So the green part is 4 parts, and that equals 120 sweets. I think I can set up a proportion here. \n\nLet me write this down. If 4 parts correspond to 120 sweets, then one part would be 120 divided by 4. Let me calculate that. 120 \u00f7 4 is 30. So each part is 30 sweets. \n\nNow, since red sweets are 3 parts, I multiply 30 by 3. That would give me 90. So the number of red sweets should be 90. \n\nLooking at the options, option A is 90. So that must be the correct answer. But wait, let me double-check. If red is 3 parts and each part is 30, then 3 *30 is 90. And green is 4 *30, which is 120, which matches the given. Yeah, that seems right.\n",

I need to find out how many red sweets there are.\n\nWait, ratios can sometimes trip me up, but I think I can handle this. Ratios are like fractions, right? So 3:4 means for every 3 red sweets, there are 4 green ones.\n\nSo the ratio of red to green is 3 parts to 4 parts. If I think of parts, maybe each part has the same number of sweets. Let me denote each part as 'x'. So red would be 3x and green would be 4x.\n\nThe problem says there are 120 green sweets. So green is 4x, which equals 120. I can set up the equation 4x = 120.\n\nTo find x, I divide both sides by 4. So x = 120 /4. Let me calculate that. 120 divided by 4 is 30.
