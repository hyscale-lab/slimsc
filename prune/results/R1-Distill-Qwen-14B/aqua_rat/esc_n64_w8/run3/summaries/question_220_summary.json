That means the total wages for the fortnight would be 15 times 90, right? Let me calculate that. 15 multiplied by 90 is 1350 dollars total.\n\nNow, the problem says that during the first 7 days, his average wage was $87 per day. So, for those 7 days, he earned 7 times 87.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a worker's average wages over a fortnight, which is 15 days. Let me try to break this down step by step. Hmm, the question is asking for his wage on the 8th day. I remember that when dealing with averages, I probably need to calculate totals and then find the missing piece.\n\nAlright, so the average wage for the entire 15 days is $90 per day. To find the total wages for the fortnight, I can multiply the average by the number of days. That would be 15 days multiplied by $90. Let me calculate that: 15 * 90 is 1350. So the total wages are $1350 for the 15 days.\n\nNow, the problem says that during the first 7 days, his average wage was $87. So the total for those 7 days would be 7 * 87. Let me compute that. 7 times 80 is 560, and 7 times 7 is 49, so 560 + 49 is 609. So the first 7 days he earned $609.\n\nSimilarly, the last 7 days have an average of $92. So the total for those 7 days is 7 * 92. Let me do that math: 7 times 90 is 630, and 7 times 2 is 14, so 630 +14=644. So the last 7 days amount to $644.\n\nWait a second, the fortnight is 15 days, which is 7 days + 1 day (the 8th day) + 7 days. So the total of the first 7 and last 7 days plus the 8th day's wage should add up to the total 15-day amount of $1350.\n\nSo, adding the first 7 and last 7 days: 609 + 644 = 1253. Then, adding the 8th day's wage (let's call it x) would make the total 1253 + x. And this should equal 1350.\n\nSo, 1253 + x = 1350. To find x, I subtract 1253 from both sides. Let's see: 1350 - 1253. Hmm, 1350 - 1250 is 100, and then minus another 3 gives 97. So x is 97.\n\nWait, wait, but looking at the options, D is 97. So that should be the answer. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst 7 days: 7 *87=609. Last 7 days:7 *92=644. Sum of these is 609+644=1253. Total for 15 days is 1350, so 1350-1253=97. Yep, that looks right. So the 8th day's wage is $97, which is option D.\n",

Correct. 609+644=1253. 15 days total is 1350. 1350 -1253=97. Yep, that seems right.\n\nSo the answer should be D) $97.\n\n\nTo determine the wage on the 8th day, we start by calculating the total wages for the fortnight. The average wage per day is $90 over 15 days, so the total wages are:\n\n\\[\n15 \\times 90 = 1350 \\, \\text{\\$}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total wages for the first 7 days, where the average wage is $87:\n\n\\[\n7 \\times 87 = 609 \\, \\text{\\$}.\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, for the last 7 days, where the average wage is $92:\n\n\\[\n7 \\times 92 = 644 \\, \\text{\\$}.\n\\]\n\nAdding the wages for the first 7 days and the last 7 days gives:\n\n\\[\n609 + 644 = 1253 \\, \\text{\\$}.\n\\]\n\nThe remaining wage, which corresponds to the 8th day, is the total wages minus the wages for the first 14 days:\n\n\\[\n1350 - 1253 = 97 \\, \\text{\\$}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the wage on the 8th day is **$97**.\n\nAnswer: D",
