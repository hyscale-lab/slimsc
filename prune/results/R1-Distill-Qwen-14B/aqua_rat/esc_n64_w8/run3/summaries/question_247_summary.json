      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Alice putting up fencing around her yard. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says she's fencing three sides of her rectangular yard and leaving one side of 10 meters unfenced. The area is 240 square meters. I need to find out how much fencing she needs.\n\nAlright, so first, the yard is rectangular, which means opposite sides are equal. But since one side is left unfenced, I'm guessing that side is either the length or the width. Wait, the problem says she's leaving one side of 10 meters unfenced. So that must be one of the sides.\n\nLet me sketch this out mentally. If the yard is a rectangle, there are two possibilities: either the unfenced side is the length or the width. But wait, the problem says she's putting fencing on three sides. So maybe it's like she's fencing the opposite side of the unfenced one, and the two adjacent sides. Hmm, I think I should define the sides.\n\nLet me assign variables. Let's say the sides of the yard are length L and width W. The area is L multiplied by W, so L * W = 240.\n\nNow, one side is 10 meters and it's unfenced. So either L is 10 or W is 10. I'm not sure yet. Let me think about both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: Suppose the unfenced side is the length. So L = 10 meters. Then the area equation becomes 10 * W = 240. Solving for W, that gives W = 24 meters. So the yard is 10m by 24m.\n\nIn this case, the fencing would be along the other length and the two widths. Wait, no. Wait, she's leaving one length side unfenced, so the fencing would be on the opposite length (which is also 10m) and both widths (each 24m). So total fencing would be 10 + 24 + 24 = 58 meters. Wait, that's option A. But I should check the other case to make sure.\n\nCase 2: Suppose the unfenced side is the width. So W = 10 meters. Then area is L * 10 = 240 \u2192 L = 24 meters. So the yard is 24m by 10m.\n\nIn this case, she's leaving one width side (10m) unfenced. So the fencing would be on the opposite width (10m) and the two lengths (each 24m). Wait, wait, that's 10 + 24 + 24 = 58 again. Wait, same as before. So either way, the total fencing is 58 meters? But wait, that can't be right because the options include 58 as A, and the options go up to 74.\n\nWait a second, maybe I'm making a mistake in which sides are being fenced. Let me clarify. Let's think of the yard as having a front, back, left, and right. She's leaving one side unfenced. Let's say the front is the unfenced side. Then she needs fencing for the back, left, and right sides.\n\nIn case 1: if the front is the length (10m), then the back is also 10m, and the left and right are each 24m. So fencing is 10 + 24 + 24 = 58. \n\nIn case 2: if the front is the width (10m), then the back is 10m, and the left and right are each 24m. Wait, but that's the same as case 1. So both cases lead to 58 meters. But wait, that can't be right because the problem says the area is 240, and 10*24=240, so both cases are the same, just rotated. So the fencing required is 58 meters. So the answer would be option A.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. What if the unfenced side is the width, but the fencing is on the two lengths and the other width? No, wait, the fencing is on three sides. So if she leaves a width (10m) unfenced, she must fence the other width and both lengths. So that's 10 + 24 +24 =58. Same as before.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 58. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Is the unfenced side the length or the width? The problem says she's leaving one side of 10m unfenced, but she could be leaving either the length or the width. So if she leaves a length of 10m, then the width is 24m, so fencing is 10 +24 +24=58. If she leaves a width of 10m, then the length is 24m, fencing is 24 +10 +24=58 again. So either way, same fencing. So answer is 58, option A.\n\nWait, but wait, the problem says she's putting fencing around three sides, which would be either two widths and one length or two lengths and one width. So, in both cases, the total fencing is 58 meters. So the answer should be A)58.\n",

The area is 240 square meters. I need to find out how much fencing she needs. \n\nWait, the yard is rectangular, so opposite sides are equal. Let me visualize it: if one side is 10 meters and not fenced, then the fencing goes around the other three sides. But wait, which side is the 10 meters? Is it one of the lengths or the widths?\n\nHmm, maybe I should denote the sides. Let's say the length is L and the width is W. But wait, the problem says one side is 10 meters. So, either L or W is 10 meters. But wait, in a rectangle, there are two lengths and two widths. If she's leaving one side of 10m unfenced, that could be either a length or a width. But then, the fencing would be on the other three sides.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if it's a length or a width. Let me think. Maybe the 10m is the length. So, the fencing would be on both widths and one length. Or, maybe the 10m is a width, so fencing covers two lengths and one width. But without knowing which, I might have to figure it out.\n\nWait, but the area is 240. So, if the unfenced side is 10 meters, that's either L or W. Let's try both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: Suppose the 10m is the length (L=10). Then the area is L*W = 240. So 10 * W =240 \u2192 W=24 meters.\n\nIn this case, the fencing would be for the other two widths and one length.

So in both cases, the fencing needed is 58 meters.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because in the first case, the fencing is W + W + L, and in the second case, it's L + L + W.

But wait, why are the options including higher numbers? Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, let me double-check. Maybe the unfenced side is not necessarily the same as either L or W? No, that can't be. The yard is rectangular, so all four sides are either L or W, with two each. So if one side is 10m, it's either L or W.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in considering which sides are being fenced. Let's think again: the three sides being fenced.\n\nIf the yard is a rectangle, and the unfenced side is 10m, then the fencing is on the other three. So, suppose the unfenced side is one of the widths. Then, the fencing would be the other width and the two lengths.\n\nWait, no. Let me imagine the rectangle. Let's say the rectangle has two lengths (top and bottom) and two widths (left and right). Suppose the right side (a width) is unfenced. Then the fencing would be left width, top length, and bottom length. So total fencing is W + L + L. So in this case, if the unfenced side is a width (W=10), then the fencing is 10 (left W) + L + L. Wait, but in this scenario, the unfenced side is a W, so W=10.\n\nWait, no, the area is L * W =240. So if W is 10, L would be 24. Then fencing is W + L + L =10 +24 +24=58.\n\nAlternatively, if the unfenced side is a length (L=10), then W=24. Fencing is L (other length) + W + W. So 10 +24 +24=58 again.\n\nWait, so in both cases, the fencing is 58 meters. So the correct answer is 58, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option A is 58. So that should be the answer. But I'm a bit confused because the options go up to 74, but maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding which sides are being fenced. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nIf the yard is a rectangle, and one side is 10m and unfenced, then the fencing is around the other three sides. So if the 10m is a width, then the fencing would consist of two lengths and one width.\n\nWait, no. Let's get this straight. Suppose the yard is a rectangle with length L and width W. If the side that's unfenced is a length, then the fencing would be two widths and one length.\n\nWait, no. Let me think in terms of the rectangle. Let's say the rectangle has two lengths (front and back) and two widths (left and right). If the front length is unfenced, then the fencing would be the two widths (left and right) and the back length. So fencing is W + L + W = 2W + L.\n\nBut if the unfenced side is a width (e.g., the right width is unfenced), then fencing would be the front length, the back length, and the left width. So L + L + W = 2L + W.\n\nSo in either case, the fencing is either 2W + L or 2L + W, depending on which side is unfenced.\n\nBut the area is L*W=240.\n\nSo we have two scenarios:\n\n1. Unfenced side is a length (L=10)\n   Then area is L*W=10*W=240 \u2192 W=24.\n   Fencing needed: 2W + L = 2*24 +10=48+10=58.\n\n2.

Unfenced side is a length (L=10)\n   Then area is L*W=10*W=240 \u2192 W=24.\n   Fencing needed: 2W + L = 2*24 +10=48+10=58.\n\n2. Unfenced side is a width (W=10)\n   Area is L*10=240 \u2192 L=24.\n   Fencing needed: 2L + W =2*24 +10=48+10=58.\n\nSo in either case, the fencing is 58 meters. So the correct answer is option A)58.\n\n\nAlice wants to fence three sides of her rectangular yard, leaving one side of 10 meters unfenced. The yard has an area of 240 square meters. To determine how much fencing she needs, we analyze the problem as follows:\n\nLet the length and width of the yard be \\( L \\) and \\( W \\), respectively. The area of the yard is given by \\( L \\times W = 240 \\). Since one side of 10 meters is unfenced, this side could either be \\( L \\) or \\( W \\). We consider both cases:\n\n1. **Case 1: The unfenced side is a length (\\( L = 10 \\))**  \n   Using the area formula:  \n   \\[\n   L \\times W = 240 \\implies 10 \\times W = 240 \\implies W = 24 \\, \\text{meters}.\n   \\]  \n   The fencing required covers the other three sides: two widths and one length. Thus, the total fencing is:  \n   \\[\n   2W + L = 2 \\times 24 + 10 = 48 + 10 = 58 \\, \\text{meters}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Case 2: The unfenced side is a width (\\( W = 10 \\))**  \n   Using the area formula:  \n   \\[\n   L \\times W = 240 \\implies L \\times 10 = 240 \\implies L = 24 \\, \\text{meters}.\n   \\]  \n   The fencing required covers the other three sides: two lengths and one width. Thus, the total fencing is:  \n   \\[\n   2L + W = 2 \\times 24 + 10 = 48 + 10 = 58 \\, \\text{meters}.\n   \\]\n\nIn both cases, the total fencing required is 58 meters.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nAlice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. The yard has an area of 240 square meters. The question is, how many meters of fencing does she need? The options are A)58, B)62, C)66, D)70, E)74.\n\nHmm, alright, let's break this down. So the yard is rectangular, meaning it has two pairs of equal sides. Let's say the length and the width. One side is unfenced, which is 10 meters. So that's one of the sides she's not fencing. But wait, which side is it? Is it the length or the width?\n\nWait, the problem says three sides are fenced, leaving one side of 10 meters unfenced. So the unfenced side could be either the length or the width. But without knowing, maybe I can figure it out based on the area.\n\nLet me think: the area of a rectangle is length multiplied by width. So if one side is 10 meters, and the area is 240, then the other side must be 240 divided by 10, which is 24 meters. So the sides are 10 and 24 meters.\n\nBut wait, which one is which? If the unfenced side is 10 meters, then the fencing would cover the other two sides of 10 meters each and the two sides of 24 meters each. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, she's only fencing three sides. So if the unfenced side is 10 meters, then the fencing would be two sides of 24 meters and one side of 10 meters. Or if the unfenced side is 24 meters, then the fencing would be two sides of 10 meters and one side of 24.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The problem says she leaves one side of 10 meters unfenced. So the 10 meters is the length of one side. So that side is not fenced. So the other three sides are fenced. So the fencing would include the two widths and one length, or the two lengths and one width, depending on which side is unfenced.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I should define variables. Let me denote the sides. Let's say the yard has length L and width W. The unfenced side is 10 meters. So either L =10 or W=10.\n\nCase 1: Suppose the unfenced side is the length, L=10. Then the area is L*W = 10*W =240. So W=24 m. Then, the fencing is for the other three sides: two widths (each 24m) and one length (10m). So total fencing would be 2*24 +10 =48+10=58 meters. Hmm, that's option A.\n\nCase 2: Alternatively, if the unfenced side is the width, W=10. Then area is L*10=240, so L=24 m. The fencing would be two lengths (24 each) and one width (10). So 2*24 +10=58 meters again.\n\nWait, so both cases give the same total fencing? That's interesting. Because in both cases, the total fencing is 58 meters. So the answer would be A)58.\n\nWait, but wait, wait a minute. No, wait. Because the problem states she's putting up fencing around three sides. So if the unfenced side is 10 meters, and the area is 240, then regardless of whether the 10 is length or width, the fencing is 2*(other side) +10.\n\nWait, but in the first case, if the unfenced is length, then the fencing is 2*width + length. Wait, no, wait. If the yard is a rectangle, the three sides she fences would be two of the widths and one length, if the unfenced is the length. Or two lengths and one width, if the unfenced is the width.\n\nWait, let me draw this in my mind. Imagine the rectangle. If the unfenced side is the length, then the other three sides are two widths and one length. So fencing is 2W + L.\n\nIf the unfenced side is the width, then the other three sides are two lengths and one width, so fencing is 2L + W.\n\nIn either case, since either L or W is 10, and the other is 24.\n\nSo in case 1: L=10, W=24. Fencing = 2*24 +10=58.\n\nCase 2: W=10, L=24. Fencing=2*24 +10=58.\n\nSo either way, it's 58 meters. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Wait, no. Because when the unfenced side is a length, then the fencing is 2W + L, which is 2*24 +10=58.\n\nIf the unfenced side is a width, then the fencing is 2L + W=2*24 +10=58. So same result.\n\nSo yeah, the answer is A)58.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, 58 is option A. So the correct answer is A.\n",

Because sometimes in such problems, you might have to check whether the unfenced side is a length or a width, but perhaps the problem specifies which side is left open. Wait, the problem says \"one side of 10 meters unfenced\"\u2014it doesn't specify which, but maybe the side is a length or a width, but perhaps the fencing is two widths and one length, or two lengths and one width.\n\nWait, but in both cases, the calculation ends up as 58. So the answer must be 58, which is option A.\n\nWait, but why are the options so spread out? Let me check my calculations again.\n\nIn case 1: L=10, so W=24. Fencing is L + 2W=10+48=58.\n\nIn case 2: W=10, L=24. Fencing is 2L + W=48+10=58.\n\nYes, same result. So the answer is 58, option A.\n\n\nTo determine how much fencing Alice needs, we analyze the problem as follows:\n\nAlice is fencing three sides of a rectangular yard, leaving one side of 10 meters unfenced. The yard has an area of 240 square meters. Let the length and width of the yard be \\( L \\) and \\( W \\), respectively. The area is given by:\n\n\\[\nL \\times W = 240\n\\]\n\nThe unfenced side is 10 meters. This could either be a length (\\( L = 10 \\)) or a width (\\( W = 10 \\)). We analyze both cases:\n\n### Case 1: Unfenced side is a length (\\( L = 10 \\))\nIf \\( L = 10 \\), then the width \\( W \\) can be calculated using the area formula:\n\\[\nW = \\frac{240}{L} = \\frac{240}{10} = 24 \\, \\text{meters}.\n\\]\nThe fencing required is for the other length and both widths:\n\\[\n\\text{Fencing} = L + 2W = 10 + 2(24) = 10 + 48 = 58 \\, \\text{meters}.\n\\]\n\n### Case 2: Unfenced side is a width (\\( W = 10 \\))\nIf \\( W = 10 \\), then the length \\( L \\) can be calculated using the area formula:\n\\[\nL = \\frac{240}{W} = \\frac{240}{10} = 24 \\, \\text{meters}.\n\\]\nThe fencing required is for both lengths and the other width:\n\\[\n\\text{Fencing} = 2L + W = 2(24) + 10 = 48 + 10 = 58 \\, \\text{meters}.\n\\]\n\nIn both cases, the total fencing required is **58 meters**.

She's leaving one side of 10 meters unfenced. I think that means either the length or the width is 10 meters. Wait, but which one?

The area of the yard is 240 square meters. I need to figure out how many meters of fencing she needs.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. The yard is rectangular, so it has two pairs of equal sides. Let me visualize it. If one of the longer sides is left unfenced, then the fencing would be along the other long side and both of the shorter sides. Or wait, maybe the 10 meters is one of the shorter sides. I'm not sure yet, so I should probably define some variables.\n\nLet me call the length of the side that's unfenced as, say, L. So L is 10 meters. The other three sides that need fencing would be the other length (same as L) and the two widths. Wait, no, that can't be right because if the unfenced side is a length, then the fencing would be for the opposite length and the two widths. But wait, maybe the 10 meters is a width. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should denote the sides properly. Let's say the yard is a rectangle with length 'l' and width 'w'. The area is l multiplied by w, so l * w = 240.\n\nNow, one side is left unfenced. The problem says one side of 10 meters is unfenced. So either the length or the width is 10 meters. I think I need to figure out which one it is based on the fencing setup.\n\nWait, the problem says she's putting fencing around three sides. So the three sides she's fencing could be two widths and one length, or two lengths and one width, depending on which side is left unfenced.\n\nBut the problem states that the unfenced side is 10 meters. So the unfenced side could be a length or a width. Let's consider both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: Unfenced side is a length (l) = 10 m. Then the fencing would cover the other length (l) and the two widths (w each). So the total fencing needed would be l + 2w.\n\nBut wait, wait.

But since l is 10, then fencing is 10 + 2w.\n\nBut wait, the area is l * w = 240. So if l is 10, then w = 240 / 10 = 24 meters. So then the fencing would be 10 + 2*24 = 10 +48=58 meters. Hmm, that's one of the options, option A.\n\nCase 2: Unfenced side is a width (w) =10 m. Then the fencing would be the opposite width and the two lengths. So fencing is 2l + w. Since w is 10, fencing is 2l +10.\n\nThe area equation is l *w=240, so l=240/w. Since w is 10, l=24 meters. So fencing is 2*24 +10=48+10=58 meters. Wait, that's the same as case 1. That can't be right, because in one case the unfenced side is length, in the other it's width, but the fencing comes out the same.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm making a mistake.

That's strange because the options have 58 as option A, which would be the answer in both cases. But wait, that can't be right because the fencing depends on which side is unfenced.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I'm mixing up the sides. Let me think again.\n\nIf the yard is a rectangle, and the unfenced side is one of the lengths, then the other three sides (one length and two widths) are fenced. But if the unfenced side is a width, then the fencing is two lengths and one width. But in both cases, if l and w are determined correctly, perhaps the fencing comes out the same.\n\nWait, but let's re-examine the area. If the unfenced side is a length (10 m), then the area is 10 * w = 240 => w=24. So fencing is 10 (other length) + 2*24 (two widths) = 10+48=58.\n\nIf the unfenced side is a width (10 m), then area is l *10=240 => l=24. Fencing is 2*24 (two lengths) +10 (other width) =48 +10=58.\n\nSo in both cases, fencing is 58 meters. So the answer is option A.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 58, which would be correct. So why are there other options? Maybe I'm missing something. Oh wait, perhaps I got the sides wrong. Because in a rectangle, there are two lengths and two widths. So if she's leaving one length unfenced, she's fencing the other length and both widths.

The area of the yard is 240 square meters. I need to find out how much fencing she needs in total. Hmm, let me think through this.\n\nFirst, I should probably visualize the problem. Imagine a rectangle. One of the longer sides is left unfenced, so fencing goes around the other three sides. Wait, but wait\u2014does the unfenced side have to be a length or a width? The problem says one side of 10 meters is unfenced. So that's either the length or the width. But which one?\n\nWait, the rectangle has two lengths and two widths. So if one of them is 10 meters, then the other dimension can be found using the area. Because area is length multiplied by width. So if one side is 10 meters, the other side must be 240 divided by 10, which is 24 meters. So the sides are 10 and 24 meters.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if the unfenced side is the length or the width. Because depending on that, the fencing required might change. Let me think: If the unfenced side is 10 meters, then the fencing would cover the other length and both widths. Alternatively, if the unfenced side is 24 meters, then the fencing covers the other three sides, which would be two lengths of 24 and one width of 10. Wait no, no, wait\u2014wait, no, because if the unfenced side is 24, then the other three sides are two 10-meter sides and one 24-meter side. But wait, that might not make sense because the area is 10 * 24.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this step by step. Let me assign variables.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the length as L and the width as W. The area is L * W = 240.\n\nOne side is 10 meters. So either L=10 or W=10.\n\nCase 1: L =10 meters.\n\nThen W would be 240 /10 =24 meters. So the sides are 10 and 24.\n\nNow, fencing is needed for three sides. Which three? If the unfenced side is the length (10m), then the fencing would be along the two widths and one length. Wait no\u2014no, if the unfenced side is the length, then the other three sides are two widths and the other length. Wait, the rectangle has two lengths and two widths. So if one length is unfenced, the other length is fenced, and both widths are fenced. So fencing would be: length (10m) + 2 * width (24m each). Wait no, no\u2014wait, if the unfenced side is a length, then the fencing would be the other length plus both widths. So fencing total would be (10 + 24 + 24) meters. So 10 + 24*2=10+48=58 meters.\n\nCase 2: W =10 meters.\n\nThen L =240 /10 =24 meters. So the sides are 24 and 10.\n\nIn this case, if the unfenced side is a width (10m), then the fencing would cover the two lengths and one width. So fencing total is (24 +24 +10) =58 meters again.\n\nWait, so both cases give the same fencing length? Hmm, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I messed up the case.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me make sure.\n\nIf the unfenced side is the length (10m), then the fencing is the other length and two widths. So fencing would be L + 2W. Wait, but in this case, if L is 10, then fencing is 10 + 2*24 =58 meters.\n\nIf the unfenced side is the width (10m), then the fencing is 2*L + W. So 2*24 +10=48+10=58 meters. Oh, same result. So regardless of which side is unfenced, the fencing needed is 58 meters.\n\nWait, but the options are A)58, B)62, etc. So the answer should be 58, which is option A.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check. Because sometimes I might mix up which sides are which.\n\nWait, the problem says she leaves one side of 10 meters unfenced. So the side that's 10 meters is either the length or the width. But in both cases, the fencing comes to 58 meters.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem states three sides are fenced, and one is not. So in both cases, the fencing is the same. So the answer should be 58, option A.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 58. So that must be the answer.\n",

The area of the yard is 240 square meters. I need to find out how much fencing she needs in total. Hmm, let me think through this.\n\nFirst, I should probably visualize the problem. Imagine a rectangle. One of the longer sides is left unfenced, so fencing goes around the other three sides. Wait, but wait\u2014does the unfenced side have to be a length or a width? The problem says one side of 10 meters is unfenced. So that's either the length or the width. But which one?\n\nWait, the rectangle has two lengths and two widths. So if one of them is 10 meters, then the other dimension can be found using the area. Because area is length multiplied by width. So if one side is 10 meters, the other side must be 240 divided by 10, which is 24 meters. So the sides are 10 and 24 meters.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if the unfenced side is the length or the width. Because depending on that, the fencing required might change. Let me think: If the unfenced side is 10 meters, then the fencing would cover the other length and both widths. Alternatively, if the unfenced side is 24 meters, then the fencing covers the other three sides, which would be two lengths of 24 and one width of 10.

So the sides are 24 and 10.\n\nIn this case, if the unfenced side is a width (10m), then the fencing would cover the two lengths and one width.

Wait, the fencing would be for two widths and one length? Or wait, no. If the yard is a rectangle, the sides are arranged as two lengths and two widths.
