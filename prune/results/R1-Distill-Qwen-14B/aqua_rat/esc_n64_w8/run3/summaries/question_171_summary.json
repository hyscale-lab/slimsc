      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about magazine subscriptions, and I need to find the cover price per issue. Hmm, let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says that a subscription for 15 issues costs $42.00, and this represents a saving of 25 percent off the cover price. So, the $42 is what you pay when you subscribe, and you're saving 25% compared to buying each issue at the cover price.\n\nWait, I think I get it. So normally, if you bought each issue at the cover price, you'd pay more because the subscription is cheaper. The subscription gives a 25% discount. So the $42 is 75% of the total cover price for 15 issues.\n\nRight, because 100% minus 25% saving is 75%. So, the total cover price for 15 issues would be higher than $42. Let me write down the math.\n\nLet me call the total cover price for 15 issues as T. The subscription price is $42, which is 75% of T. So, 42 = 0.75 * T. To find T, I can rearrange that: T = 42 / 0.75.\n\nCalculating that, 42 divided by 0.75. Let me think, 0.75 is the same as 3/4, so dividing by 3/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/3. So 42 * (4/3) = 56. Because 42 divided by 3 is 14, multiplied by 4 is 56.\n\nSo the total cover price for 15 issues is $56. Now, to find the cover price per issue, I divide this by 15.\n\n56 divided by 15. Hmm, let me calculate that. 15 times 3 is 45, 15 times 3.73 is... Wait, wait, 15 times 3 is 45, 15 times 3.73 is 55.95, which is close to 56. So 3.73 would give me 56. So each issue's cover price is approximately $3.73?\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is $3.73. But let me double-check the math because sometimes I make mistakes.\n\nWait, wait. Let's do 56 divided by 15 precisely. 15 goes into 56 three times (3*15=45). Subtract 45 from 56, that leaves 11. Bring down a zero; 110. 15 goes into 110 seven times (7*15=105). Subtract 105, leaves 5. Bring down another zero: 50. 15 goes into 50 three times (3*15=45), leaves 5 again. So it's 3.7333... So approximately $3.73. So the cover price per issue is $3.73, which is option E.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because the problem says the subscription represents a saving of 25% of the cover prices. So the subscription is 25% off, which means the subscription is 75% of the total cover price. So yes, the total cover price is 42 / 0.75 = 56. Then 56/15 is about 3.73. So option E.\n\nBut wait, let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)7.73\nB)6.73\nC)5.73\nD)4.73\nE)3.73\n\nSo E is the correct option. But wait, another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the saving is 25% per issue? No, the problem says the subscription for 15 issues represents a saving of 25% of the cover prices. So the 25% saving is on the total cover price for 15 issues, not per issue.\n\nSo that approach was correct. So the answer should be E.\n",

So, the question says that a subscription for 15 issues costs $42.00, and this represents a 25% saving compared to buying each issue individually at the cover price. I need to find out what the cover price per issue is.\n\nHmm, right. So, the subscription is cheaper because you're getting a discount. The $42 is 25% off the total cover price for all 15 issues. Wait, how does that work? Let me think. If the subscription is a saving of 25%, that means the subscription price is 75% of the total cover price. Because 100% minus 25% saving is 75%. Oh, right! So, the $42 is 75% of what the total would be if you bought each issue at the cover price.\n\nSo, I can model this as an equation. Let me call the total cover price for 15 issues as T. Then, 75% of T equals $42. So mathematically, that's 0.75 * T = 42. To find T, I can divide 42 by 0.75.\n\nLet me compute that. 42 divided by 0.75. Well, 0.75 is the same as 3/4. So dividing by 3/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/3. So 42 * (4/3) = ?\n\nCalculating 42 * 4 = 168, then divided by 3 is 56. So T is $56. So the total cover price for 15 issues is $56. Now, to find the cover price per issue, I divide this total by 15.\n\nSo 56 divided by 15. Let me do that division. 15 goes into 56 three times (15*3=45) with a remainder of 11. 11/15 is approximately 0.7333... So 56/15 \u2248 3.7333.

So 11 divided by 15 is 0.7333. So 3.7333. So approximately $3.73 per issue. Looking at the options, option E is $3.73.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. The 25% saving is on the total cover price. So the subscription is 25% cheaper than buying each issue. So the subscription is 75% of the total cover price, yes. So T = 42 / 0.75 = 56. Then each issue is 56 /15 \u2248 3.733. So about $3.73, which is option E.\n\nBut looking at the options, E is $3.73.

Maybe I should check the math again.\n\nSo, 0.75 * T =42 \u2192 T=42 / 0.75. Let me compute 42 divided by 0.75. Let's see, 0.75 times 56 is 42? Because 0.75 * 50 is 37.5, and 0.75 *6 is 4.5, so 37.5+4.5=42. Yes, so T is 56. Then 56 divided by 15 is 3.733... So, yes, about 3.73.

The options are A)7.73, B)6.73, C)5.73, D)4.73, E)3.73.\n\nSo the closest is E) $3.73. But wait, wait a minute, 56/15 is exactly 3.733333..., so approximately $3.73. So option E is correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps.\n\nSo the initial step: the subscription is 25% off the cover price. So the subscription is 75% of the total cover price.\n\nYes, because if you take the total cover price and subtract 25%, you get 75% of it, which is the subscription price.\n\nSo 42 is 75% of the total. So 42 = 0.75 * total. So total is 42 / 0.75 = 56. Correct.\n\nThen 56 divided by 15 is 3.7333... which is approximately 3.73.\n\nSo the cover price per issue is about $3.73, which is option E.\n\n\nTo determine the cover price per issue, we start by noting that the subscription price of $42 represents a 25% saving compared to the total cover price. This means the subscription price is 75% of the total cover price for 15 issues. \n\nUsing the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Subscription price} = \\text{Total cover price} \\times (1 - \\text{discount rate})\n\\]\n\nwe substitute the known values:\n\n\\[\n42 = \\text{Total cover price} \\times 0.75\n\\]\n\nSolving for the total cover price:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cover price} = \\frac{42}{0.75} = 56\n\\]\n\nThe total cover price for 15 issues is $56. To find the cover price per issue, divide the total cover price by the number of issues:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cover price per issue} = \\frac{56}{15} \\approx 3.73\n\\]\n\nThus, the cover price per issue is approximately $3.73, which corresponds to option E.\n\nAnswer: E",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about magazine subscriptions, and I need to figure out the cover price per issue. Let me think through this step by step. \n\nAlright, the problem says that a subscription for 15 issues costs $42.00 and represents a 25% saving compared to buying each issue at the cover price. So, the subscription is cheaper because it's a bulk purchase, right? \n\nWait, the saving is 25%, which means the subscription price is 25% less than the total cover price. Or wait, no, maybe I should clarify that. If the subscription gives a 25% saving, that implies that the subscription price is 75% of the total cover price. Because 100% minus 25% saving is 75%, so the subscription is 75% of the total cost when buying individually.\n\nLet me write that down. Let me denote the total cover price for 15 issues as T. The subscription price is 42, which is 75% of T. So mathematically, 42 = 0.75 * T. \n\nTo find T, I can rearrange that equation. T = 42 / 0.75. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 42 divided by 0.75. Well, 0.75 is the same as 3/4, so dividing by 3/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/3. So 42 * (4/3) is... Let's see, 42 divided by 3 is 14, then multiplied by 4 is 56. So T is $56.\n\nWait, so the total cover price for 15 issues is $56. Now, to find the cover price per issue, I just divide that by 15. So 56 divided by 15. Let me do that division. 15 goes into 56 three times because 15*3 is 45. Subtract 45 from 56, you get 11. Bring down a zero: 110. 15 goes into 110 seven times (15*7=105). Subtract, get 5. Bring down another zero: 50. 15 goes into 50 three times (15*3=45), remainder 5. Hmm, this is starting to repeat. So 56 divided by 15 is 3.733... So approximately $3.733 per issue.\n\nWait, looking at the options, option E is $3.73. But wait, let me check my math again because that seems lower than some of the other options. Let me double-check the initial steps.\n\nThe subscription is 25% off the cover price. So the subscription price is 75% of the total cover price. So 42 is 75% of T. So T = 42 / 0.75 = 56. That part seems right. \n\nThen 56 divided by 15 issues. Let me compute it precisely. 15 times 3 is 45, as before. 56-45=11. 11/15 is 0.733333... So 3.733333, which is approximately 3.73. So the cover price per issue is $3.73. \n\nWait, but the options include E) $3.73. So that's the answer? But looking at the options, I see that option E is $3.73, which matches. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says that the subscription represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices. So another way to look at it is that the subscription price is the total cover price minus 25% of that. So, Subscription = Cover price - 0.25 * Cover price. Which simplifies to Subscription = 0.75 * Cover price. That's the same as before. So T = 42 / 0.75 = 56, and 56 /15 is indeed about 3.73. \n\nHmm, but wait, let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA) $7.73\nB) $6.73\nC) $5.73\nD) $4.73\nE) $3.73\n\nSo E is the correct option. Wait, but I thought maybe I made a mistake because 3.73 seems low, but maybe it's correct.

Or wait, maybe it's that the subscription price is 25% of the cover price total. No, that doesn't make sense because if it's 25%, the saving would be more than half. Wait, let me think.\n\nSo, if the subscription cost is $42, which is a 25% saving, then the original total cover price would be higher than $42. The subscription is 25% off, so the $42 is 75% of the total cover price. Because if you save 25%, you're paying 75% of the original price.\n\nLet me write that down. Let the total cover price be T. Then, the subscription cost is T minus 25% of T, which is 0.75*T. So, 0.75*T equals $42. So, to find T, I can divide 42 by 0.75.\n\nWait, yeah, that makes sense. So T = 42 / 0.75.

Let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nAlright, the problem says that a subscription for 15 issues costs $42.00, and this subscription represents a 25% saving compared to buying each issue at the cover price. So, I need to find out what the cover price per issue is.\n\nHmm, I think the key here is understanding what the 25% saving means. So, the subscription is cheaper than buying each issue separately. The saving is 25%, which I believe means that the subscription price is 25% less than the total cover price of all 15 issues. \n\nWait, let me think. If the subscription is a saving of 25%, that would imply that the subscription price is 75% of the total cover price. Because 100% minus 25% saving equals 75% of the original cost. So, the $42 is 75% of what the total would be if bought individually.\n\nSo, mathematically, I can represent this as:\nSubscription Price = (100% - 25%) * Total Cover Price\nWhich is:\n42 = 0.75 * Total Cover Price\n\nSo, to find the total cover price for all 15 issues, I can rearrange this equation. I need to solve for the total cover price. \n\nLet me write it out: Total Cover Price = 42 / 0.75.\n\nCalculating that, 42 divided by 0.75. Hmm, 0.75 is the same as 3/4, so dividing by 3/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/3. So, 42 * (4/3) = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 42 divided by 3 is 14. Then 14 multiplied by 4 is 56. So the total cover price for all 15 issues is $56.\n\nWait, so each issue would then cost 56 divided by 15. Let me do that division. 56 \u00f7 15.\n\nHmm, 15 goes into 56 three times (because 15*3=45), with a remainder of 11. So, 3 and 11/15. As a decimal, 11 divided by 15 is approximately 0.7333. So, adding that to 3 gives 3.7333... So, about $3.73 per issue.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option E is $3.73. But wait, I'm not sure if I did the steps correctly. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, another way to approach this: The subscription saves 25%, so the total cover price is higher than the subscription price by 25% of the cover price. So, maybe I should set it up differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the subscription price is 75% of the cover price. So, 42 is 75% of the total cover price. So, same as before: 42 = 0.75 * T. So, T=56. So, each issue is 56/15 \u22483.7333.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me compute 15 times 3.73. 15 * 3 is 45, 15 * 0.73 is 10.95. So 45 +10.95 is 55.95, which is roughly 56. So that checks out.\n\nBut wait, the options given are A)7.73, B)6.73, C)5.73, D)4.73, E)3.73.\n\nSo according to this, the answer should be E) $3.73.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because 3.73 seems low. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says the subscription is 25% saving. So, if the subscription is cheaper by 25%, that implies that the subscription price is 75% of the total cover price. So yes, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the total cover price minus 25% equals the subscription price. So, Cover price * (1 - 0.25) = 42. So Cover price = 42 / 0.75 =56. So each issue is 56/15 \u22483.73. So, E is the answer.\n\nBut wait, another thought: Maybe the saving is per issue. No, the question says the subscription represents a 25% saving, so it's a 25% discount on the total cover price.\n\nSo, I think my earlier calculation is correct, and the answer should be E.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about magazine subscriptions, and I'm supposed to find the cover price per issue. Let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nAlright, the problem says that a subscription for 15 issues costs $42.00, and this subscription represents a 25% saving compared to buying each issue at the cover price. So, I need to find out what the cover price per issue is.\n\nHmm, I think the key here is understanding what the 25% saving means. So, the subscription is cheaper than buying each issue separately. The saving is 25%, which I believe means that the subscription price is 25% less than the total cover price of all 15 issues. \n\nWait, let me think. If the subscription is a saving of 25%, that would imply that the subscription price is 75% of the total cover price. Because 100% minus 25% saving equals 75% of the original cost. So, the $42 is 75% of what the total would be if bought individually.\n\nSo, mathematically, I can represent this as:\nSubscription Price = (100% - 25%) * Total Cover Price\nWhich is:\n42 = 0.75 * Total Cover Price\n\nSo, to find the total cover price for all 15 issues, I can rearrange this equation. I need to solve for the total cover price. \n\nLet me write it out: Total Cover Price = 42 / 0.75.\n\nCalculating that, 42 divided by 0.75. Hmm, 0.75 is the same as 3/4, so dividing by 3/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/3. So, 42 * (4/3) = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 42 divided by 3 is 14. Then 14 multiplied by 4 is 56. So the total cover price for all 15 issues is $56.\n\nWait, so each issue would then cost 56 divided by 15. Let me do that division. 56 \u00f7 15.\n\nHmm, 15 goes into 56 three times (because 15*3=45), with a remainder of 11. So, 3 and 11/15. As a decimal, 11 divided by 15 is approximately 0.7333. So, adding that to 3 gives 3.7333... So, about $3.73 per issue.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option E is $3.73. But wait, I'm not sure if I did the steps correctly. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, another way to approach this: The subscription saves 25%, so the total cover price is higher than the subscription price by 25% of the cover price. So, maybe I should set it up differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the subscription price is 75% of the cover price. So, 42 is 75% of the total cover price. So, same as before: 42 = 0.75 * T. So, T=56. So, each issue is 56/15 \u22483.7333.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me compute 15 times 3.73. 15 * 3 is 45, 15 * 0.73 is 10.95. So 45 +10.95 is 55.95, which is roughly 56. So that checks out.\n\nBut wait, the options given are A)7.73, B)6.73, C)5.73, D)4.73, E)3.73.\n\nSo according to this, the answer should be E) $3.73.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because 3.73 seems low. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says the subscription is 25% saving. So, if the subscription is cheaper by 25%, that implies that the subscription price is 75% of the total cover price. So yes, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the total cover price minus 25% equals the subscription price. So, Cover price * (1 - 0.25) = 42. So Cover price = 42 / 0.75 =56. So each issue is 56/15 \u22483.73. So, E is the answer.\n\nBut wait, another thought: Maybe the saving is per issue. No, the question says the subscription represents a 25% saving, so it's a 25% discount on the total cover price.\n\nSo, I think my earlier calculation is correct, and the answer should be E.\n\n\nThe problem states that a subscription for 15 issues of a magazine costs $42.00 and represents a 25% saving compared to buying each issue at the cover price. To find the cover price per issue, we first recognize that the subscription price ($42) is 75% of the total cover price for all 15 issues. This is because a 25% saving means the subscription price is 100% - 25% = 75% of the total cover price.\n\nUsing the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Subscription Price} = 0.75 \\times \\text{Total Cover Price}\n\\]\n\nwe can solve for the total cover price:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Cover Price} = \\frac{\\text{Subscription Price}}{0.75} = \\frac{42}{0.75} = 56\n\\]\n\nThe total cover price for all 15 issues is $56. To find the cover price per issue, we divide the total cover price by the number of issues:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cover Price per Issue} = \\frac{\\text{Total Cover Price}}{15} = \\frac{56}{15} \\approx 3.73\n\\]\n\nThus, the cover price per issue is approximately $3.73, which corresponds to option E.\n\nAnswer: E",

I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of problems, but I think I can work through it step by step.\n\nAlright, first, I remember that when something is sold at a discount, the amount you save is a percentage of the original price. So here, the subscription is cheaper than buying each issue at the cover price. The saving is 25%, which I think means that the subscription price is 25% less than the total cover price for all 15 issues.\n\nWait, maybe I should define some variables to make it clearer. Let me let C be the cover price per issue. So, the total cover price for 15 issues would be 15 times C, right? So that's 15C.\n\nThe subscription price is $42, and that's after a 25% saving. So the subscription price is 75% of the total cover price because 100% minus 25% is 75%. Oh, right, because 25% off means you're paying 75% of the original.\n\nSo putting that together, the subscription price ($42) is equal to 75% of the total cover price. So mathematically, that's 42 = 0.75 * (15C). \n\nWait, let me write that down to make it clear. So:\n\n42 = 0.75 * (15C)\n\nHmm, I can solve for C here. Let me compute 15C first. 15 times C is 15C, but I can compute 0.75 * 15 first. Let's see, 0.75 times 15. Well, 15 * 0.75 is the same as 15 * 3/4, which is (15 /4)*3. 15 divided by 4 is 3.75, multiplied by 3 is 11.25. So 0.75 * 15 = 11.25. \n\nSo the equation now is 42 = 11.25 * C. To find C, I can divide both sides by 11.25. \n\nSo C = 42 / 11.25. Let me calculate that. \n\nDividing 42 by 11.25. Hmm, 11.25 goes into 42 how many times? Let's see, 11.25 * 3 = 33.75, because 11 *3 is 33, 0.25*3 is 0.75, so 33.75. Subtract that from 42: 42 - 33.75 = 8.25. Now, 11.25 goes into 8.25 how many times? 0.75 times because 11.25 * 0.75 is 8.4375? Wait, no, wait: 11.25 * 0.7 is 7.875, and 0.05 more would be 0.5625, so 7.875 +0.5625=8.4375. Wait, but we have 8.25 left, which is less than 8.4375. Hmm, maybe I should think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to convert 42 divided by 11.25 into fractions. Let's see, 42 is 42/1, and 11.25 is 45/4 because 11.25 is 45 divided by 4. So, 42 divided by (45/4) is the same as 42 * (4/45) = (42 *4)/45 = 168/45.\n\nSimplify 168/45: both are divisible by 3. 168 \u00f73 is 56, 45 \u00f73 is 15. So 56/15. Let me compute that as a decimal. 56 divided by 15. 15*3=45, so 3.733... So approximately 3.733, which is about $3.73.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is $3.73. But wait, let me double-check my math because sometimes I might have messed up somewhere.\n\nWait, another approach: The subscription is 42, which is 75% of the total cover price. So the total cover price is 42 divided by 0.75. Let's compute that. 42 \u00f7 0.75. Well, 0.75 is 3/4, so dividing by 3/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/3. So 42 *4 =168, divided by 3 is 56. So the total cover price for 15 issues is $56. Then, per issue, that's 56 divided by 15.\n\nWait, 56 \u00f715. Let me compute that. 15 *3 is 45, 15*3.7 is 55.5 (because 15*0.7 is 10.5, 45+10.5=55.5). 56 -55.5 is 0.5, so that's 3.7 plus 0.5/15. 0.5 divided by 15 is 0.0333... So approximately 3.7333... So about $3.73 per issue. So that's option E.\n\nWait, but let me check: 15 issues at $3.73 each is 15 * 3.73. Let's compute that. 3.73 *15. 3 *15=45, 0.73*15=10.95. So total is 45 +10.95=55.95. Hmm, but the total cover price is supposed to be $56. So 55.95 is very close, considering rounding. So that seems correct.\n\nSo the answer should be E, $3.73. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Hmm, another way: 42 is 75% of the total. So total is 42 * (100/75) = 42 * (4/3) = 56. That's correct. 56 divided by 15 is indeed approximately 3.73. So yes, the cover price per issue is about $3.73.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about magazine subscriptions, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.\n\nThe question says: A subscription for 15 issues of a magazine costs $42.00 and represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices. What is the cover price per issue? The options are A to E, with different amounts.\n\nHmm, I need to find the cover price per issue. So, the subscription price is $42 for 15 issues, which is cheaper than buying each issue at the cover price. The saving is 25%, which I think means that the subscription price is 25% less than the total cover price of all 15 issues.\n\nWait, let me think about this. If I save 25%, that means the subscription price is 75% of the total cover price. Because 100% minus 25% saving equals 75%. So, the $42 is 75% of what the total would be if bought individually.\n\nRight, so let's denote the total cover price as T. Then, 75% of T is $42. So mathematically, that's 0.75 * T = 42. To find T, I can divide 42 by 0.75.\n\nLet me calculate that. 42 divided by 0.75. Hmm, 0.75 is the same as 3/4, so dividing by 3/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/3. So 42 * (4/3) is equal to... Well, 42 divided by 3 is 14, and 14 times 4 is 56. So T is $56.\n\nSo the total cover price for 15 issues is $56. Now, the cover price per issue would be that total divided by 15. So 56 divided by 15. Let me compute that.\n\n56 divided by 15. Let's see: 15 times 3 is 45, so 3. So 3 times 15 is 45, subtract that from 56, gives 11. Bring down a zero (since we're dealing with decimals), so 110 divided by 15 is about 7 (15*7=105), with a remainder of 5. So 56/15 is 3.7333... So approximately $3.73 per issue.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is $3.73. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me double-check. Because the saving is 25%, so the subscription is 75% of the cover price. So yes, T = 42 / 0.75 = 56. Then, per issue is 56 /15.\n\nLet me compute 56 divided by 15 accurately. 15 \u00d7 3 is 45, so 56 minus 45 is 11. Bring down a zero: 110. 15 \u00d77 is 105. So 7. So 3.7333... So approximately $3.73 per issue. That would be option E.\n\nBut wait, the options are A)7.73, B)6.73, C)5.73, D)4.73, E)3.73.\n\nSo according to this, the answer is E.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Did I correctly interpret the 25% saving? Because sometimes people confuse whether the percentage is on the cover price or the subscription. Let me rephrase.\n\nThe subscription price is $42, which is a 25% saving compared to buying each issue. So, the saving is 25% of the cover price. So the subscription is 75% of the total cover price. So yes, that's correct. So T is 42 / 0.75 = 56.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it: if buying 15 issues at cover price is T, and the subscription is 25% cheaper, so the subscription is T - 0.25 T = 0.75 T =42. So T=56.\n\nSo each issue's cover price is 56 /15. Let me compute that more accurately.\n\n15 \u00d73=45, as before. 56-45=11. 11 divided by 15 is 0.7333..., so 3.7333 per issue. So about $3.73, which is option E.\n\nWait, but why are the other options higher? Let me check if I interpreted the problem correctly. Could it be that the subscription is 25% of the cover price, but that would make the subscription way too low. No, the subscription is a saving of 25% off the cover price, so the subscription is 75% of the cover price total.\n\nWait, another way: maybe the saving is 25% per issue? No, the problem says the subscription represents a saving of 25% of the cover prices. So the total saving is 25% of the total cover price.\n\nSo, total cover price is T. Subscription is T - 0.25 T = 0.75 T =42. So T=56.\n\nSo, per issue, 56/15 \u22483.73. So the answer is E.\n\nI think that's correct.\n",

What is the cover price per issue? The options are A to E, with different amounts.\n\nHmm, I need to find the cover price per issue. So, the subscription price is $42 for 15 issues, which is cheaper than buying each issue at the cover price. The saving is 25%, which I think means that the subscription price is 25% less than the total cover price of all 15 issues.\n\nWait, let me think about this. If I save 25%, that means the subscription price is 75% of the total cover price. Because 100% minus 25% saving equals 75%. So, the $42 is 75% of what the total would be if bought individually.\n\nRight, so let's denote the total cover price as T. Then, 75% of T is $42. So mathematically, that's 0.75 * T = 42. To find T, I can divide 42 by 0.75.\n\nLet me calculate that. 42 divided by 0.75. Hmm, 0.75 is the same as 3/4, so dividing by 3/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/3. So 42 * (4/3) is equal to... Well, 42 divided by 3 is 14, and 14 times 4 is 56. So T is $56.\n\nSo the total cover price for 15 issues is $56. Now, the cover price per issue would be that total divided by 15. So 56 divided by 15. Let me compute that.\n\n56 divided by 15. Let's see: 15 times 3 is 45, so 3. So 3 times 15 is 45, subtract that from 56, gives 11. Bring down a zero (since we're dealing with decimals), so 110 divided by 15 is about 7 (15*7=105), with a remainder of 5. So 56/15 is 3.7333... So approximately $3.73 per issue.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is $3.73. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me double-check. Because the saving is 25%, so the subscription is 75% of the cover price. So yes, T = 42 / 0.75 = 56. Then, per issue is 56 /15.\n\nLet me compute 56 divided by 15 accurately. 15 \u00d7 3 is 45, so 56 minus 45 is 11. Bring down a zero: 110. 15 \u00d77 is 105. So 7. So 3.7333... So approximately $3.73 per issue. That would be option E.\n\nBut wait, the options are A)7.73, B)6.73, C)5.73, D)4.73, E)3.73.\n\nSo according to this, the answer is E.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Did I correctly interpret the 25% saving? Because sometimes people confuse whether the percentage is on the cover price or the subscription. Let me rephrase.\n\nThe subscription price is $42, which is a 25% saving compared to buying each issue. So, the saving is 25% of the cover price. So the subscription is 75% of the total cover price. So yes, that's correct. So T is 42 / 0.75 = 56.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it: if buying 15 issues at cover price is T, and the subscription is 25% cheaper, so the subscription is T - 0.25 T = 0.75 T =42. So T=56.\n\nSo each issue's cover price is 56 /15. Let me compute that more accurately.\n\n15 \u00d73=45, as before. 56-45=11. 11 divided by 15 is 0.7333..., so 3.7333 per issue. So about $3.73, which is option E.\n\nWait, but why are the other options higher? Let me check if I interpreted the problem correctly. Could it be that the subscription is 25% of the cover price, but that would make the subscription way too low. No, the subscription is a saving of 25% off the cover price, so the subscription is 75% of the cover price total.\n\nWait, another way: maybe the saving is 25% per issue? No, the problem says the subscription represents a saving of 25% of the cover prices. So the total saving is 25% of the total cover price.\n\nSo, total cover price is T. Subscription is T - 0.25 T = 0.75 T =42. So T=56.\n\nSo, per issue, 56/15 \u22483.73. So the answer is E.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n\nTo determine the cover price per issue, we start by noting that the subscription cost of $42.00 represents a 25% saving compared to the total cover price of all 15 issues. This means the subscription price is 75% of the total cover price. Let the total cover price be denoted as \\( T \\). \n\nMathematically, this relationship is expressed as:\n\\[\n0.75 \\times T = 42\n\\]\nSolving for \\( T \\), we divide both sides by 0.75:\n\\[\nT = \\frac{42}{0.75} = 56\n\\]\nThus, the total cover price for 15 issues is $56. To find the cover price per issue, we divide the total cover price by the number of issues:\n\\[\n\\text{Cover price per issue} = \\frac{56}{15} \\approx 3.73\n\\]\nTherefore, the cover price per issue is approximately $3.73, which corresponds to option E.\n\nAnswer: E",
