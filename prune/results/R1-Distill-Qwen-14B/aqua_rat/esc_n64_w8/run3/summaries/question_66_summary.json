      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the solution. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a rectangular piece of land with an area of 150 square meters. The length is said to be 1 meter more than four times the breadth. I need to find the perimeter of this rectangle. Hmm, right, I remember that the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all the sides, so it's 2 times length plus 2 times breadth. But first, I need to find the actual length and breadth.\n\nWait, the problem says the area is 150 sq m. Area of a rectangle is length multiplied by breadth. Oh, right. So I'll probably need to set up an equation using that. Let me think about how to represent this.\n\nLet me assign variables to the breadth and length. Let's say the breadth is 'b' meters. Then, the length is 1m more than four times the breadth. So, length would be 4b + 1. Does that make sense? Yeah, because if the breadth is b, four times that is 4b, and adding 1 gives the length. Got it.\n\nSo the area is length multiplied by breadth, which is (4b + 1) * b = 150. Let me write that down as an equation: (4b + 1) * b = 150. Expanding that, I get 4b\u00b2 + b = 150. Hmm, but I should rearrange it into a standard quadratic equation. So subtract 150 from both sides: 4b\u00b2 + b - 150 = 0.\n\nNow, I need to solve for 'b'. This is a quadratic equation of the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0. Here, a is 4, b is 1, and c is -150. Wait, no, the coefficients are a=4, b=1, c=-150. But wait, in the equation 4b\u00b2 + b - 150 = 0, the variable is 'b', so the coefficients are for b\u00b2, b, and the constant term. So when I apply the quadratic formula, it'll be x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 4ac)]/(2a). Oh wait, but in this case, the variable is 'b', so I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should use a different variable name to avoid confusion. Let me think again. Let's let x = breadth. Then length is 4x + 1. So area is x*(4x+1) = 150. Which gives 4x\u00b2 +x -150 =0. That's better. So now, the equation is 4x\u00b2 +x -150=0.\n\nSo, applying the quadratic formula: x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 4ac)]/(2a). Here, a=4, b=1, c=-150. So let's compute the discriminant first. Discriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac = (1)^2 -4*(4)*(-150) = 1 + 4*4*150. Let me compute that: 4*4 is 16, 16 *150 is 2400. So D = 1 + 2400 = 2401. The square root of 2401 is 49 because 49*49 is 2401. So, sqrt(D) is 49.\n\nNow, plugging back into the formula: x = [ -1 \u00b1 49 ] / (2*4) = [ -1 \u00b149 ] /8. So two possible solutions: (-1 +49)/8 = 48/8 =6, and (-1 -49)/8 = -50/8 = -6.25. But since breadth can't be negative, we discard the negative solution. So x=6 meters is the breadth. So the breadth is 6 meters.\n\nThen the length is 4x +1 =4*6 +1 =24+1=25 meters. So length is 25m, breadth is 6m.\n\nNow, the perimeter is 2*(length + breadth) = 2*(25+6)=2*31=62 meters. Wait, that's one of the options. Let me check the options again. The options are A)60, B)61, C)62, D)63, E)64. So C is 62.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nArea: 25 *6 =150. Yes, that's correct. Length is 4*6 +1=25, correct. Perimeter: 2*(25+6)=2*31=62. Yes, that's right.\n\nSo the answer should be option C)62 m.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a rectangular piece of land. Let's see, the area is 150 square meters. The length is 1 meter more than four times the breadth. I need to find the perimeter. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length and breadth. So, Area = length \u00d7 breadth. The problem says the area is 150, so that's my equation. Now, the length is 1m more than four times the breadth. Oh right, so if I let the breadth be 'b', then the length would be 4 times b plus 1. So, length = 4b + 1.\n\nLet me write that down. So, length = 4b + 1. The area is 150, so substituting into the area formula: (4b + 1) \u00d7 b = 150. That gives me a quadratic equation. Let's expand that: 4b\u00b2 + b = 150. Oh wait, to solve for b, I should rearrange this into standard quadratic form. So subtract 150 from both sides: 4b\u00b2 + b - 150 = 0.\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation. Quadratic equations can be solved with the quadratic formula: b = [-B \u00b1 sqrt(B\u00b2 - 4AC)] / (2A), where A=4, B=1, C=-150. Let me compute the discriminant first: B\u00b2 -4AC = (1)^2 -4*4*(-150) = 1 + 2400 = 2401. The square root of 2401 is 49, since 49*49=2401.\n\nSo, plugging back into the formula: b = [-1 \u00b149]/(2*4). Let's compute both possibilities. First, the positive one: (-1 +49) = 48. 48 divided by 8 is 6. The other solution is (-1 -49)= -50, divided by 8 is -6.25. But breadth can't be negative, so we take the positive value. So, b = 6 meters.\n\nNow that I have the breadth, the length is 4b +1 =4*6 +1=24+1=25 meters. So length is 25 m, breadth is 6 m.\n\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + breadth).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a rectangular piece of land. Let's see, the area is 150 square meters. The length is 1 meter more than four times the breadth. I need to find the perimeter. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length and breadth. So, Area = length \u00d7 breadth. The problem says the area is 150, so that's my equation. Now, the length is 1m more than four times the breadth. Oh right, so if I let the breadth be 'b', then the length would be 4 times b plus 1. So, length = 4b + 1.\n\nLet me write that down. So, length = 4b + 1. The area is 150, so substituting into the area formula: (4b + 1) \u00d7 b = 150. That gives me a quadratic equation. Let's expand that: 4b\u00b2 + b = 150. Oh wait, to solve for b, I should rearrange this into standard quadratic form. So subtract 150 from both sides: 4b\u00b2 + b - 150 = 0.\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation. Quadratic equations can be solved with the quadratic formula: b = [-B \u00b1 sqrt(B\u00b2 - 4AC)] / (2A), where A=4, B=1, C=-150. Let me compute the discriminant first: B\u00b2 -4AC = (1)^2 -4*4*(-150) = 1 + 2400 = 2401. The square root of 2401 is 49, since 49*49=2401.\n\nSo, plugging back into the formula: b = [-1 \u00b149]/(2*4). Let's compute both possibilities. First, the positive one: (-1 +49) = 48. 48 divided by 8 is 6. The other solution is (-1 -49)= -50, divided by 8 is -6.25. But breadth can't be negative, so we take the positive value. So, b = 6 meters.\n\nNow that I have the breadth, the length is 4b +1 =4*6 +1=24+1=25 meters. So length is 25 m, breadth is 6 m.\n\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + breadth). Plugging the values in: 2*(25 +6)=2*31=62 meters. Wait, looking at the options, option C is 62. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, if length is 25 and breadth is 6, area is 25*6=150, which matches. Then perimeter is 2*(25+6) = 62. Yep, that's correct. So the answer is option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let the breadth of the rectangle be \\( b \\) meters. The length is given as \\( 4b + 1 \\) meters. The area of the rectangle is \\( 150 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\), so using the formula for the area of a rectangle:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{breadth}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[\n(4b + 1) \\times b = 150\n\\]\n\nExpanding and rearranging into standard quadratic form:\n\n\\[\n4b^2 + b - 150 = 0\n\\]\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, use the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( A = 4 \\), \\( B = 1 \\), and \\( C = -150 \\).

The length is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{length} = 4b + 1 = 4(6) + 1 = 25 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{breadth})\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (25 + 6) = 2 \\times 31 = 62 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nThus, the perimeter of the piece is **62 meters**, corresponding to option **C**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a rectangular piece of land. Let's see what it's asking. The area is 150 square meters. Hmm, right, area of a rectangle is length multiplied by breadth. Oh wait, and the length is 1 meter more than four times the breadth. Okay, that's the key information.\n\nSo, I need to find the perimeter. But first, I probably have to find the length and breadth. Let's break it down. Let me assign some variables. Let's let the breadth be 'b' meters. Then, the length must be 4 times that plus 1. So length, l = 4b + 1.\n\nSince area is length times breadth, that gives me l * b = 150. Substituting the expression for l, that becomes (4b + 1) * b = 150. Let's expand that: 4b\u00b2 + b = 150.\n\nWait, that's a quadratic equation. So I can write it as 4b\u00b2 + b - 150 = 0. Hmm, solving for b. I think I can use the quadratic formula here. The quadratic is ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, so a=4, b=1, c=-150. Wait no, wait, in the quadratic formula, it's ax\u00b2 + bx + c, but in this case, the coefficients are a=4, b=1, and c=-150.\n\nSo the quadratic formula is x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / (2a). Plugging in the numbers: b is 1, so it's [-1 \u00b1 sqrt(1^2 - 4*4*(-150))]/(2*4).\n\nCalculating the discriminant first: 1 + (4*4*150). Wait, because when you have -4ac, it's -4*(4)*(-150) which is positive. So 1 + (4*4*150) = 1 + (16*150). Let's compute that. 16 * 150 is 2400, so 2400 +1 is 2401. Oh, that's a perfect square, right? Because 49^2 is 2401. So sqrt(2401) is 49.\n\nSo the solutions are [-1 \u00b1 49]/8. So two possibilities:\n\nFirst, (-1 +49)/8 = 48/8=6. Second, (-1-49)/8 =-50/8= -6.25. But breadth can't be negative, so we take the positive solution. So b=6 meters.\n\nNow, the length l is 4b+1. So 4*6=24, plus 1 is 25. So length is 25 meters.\n\nNow, the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + breadth). So 2*(25 +6)=2*31=62 meters. Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 62 m. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, did I do that right? Let me double-check. Area is 25 *6=150, which matches. The length is 4*6+1=25. Yep, that's correct. Perimeter is 2*(25+6)=62.

The options are from A to E, with numbers 60 to 64 meters.\n\nHmm, right. So, let's think about what I know. A rectangle has length and breadth (which is the same as width). The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying length by breadth, right? And the perimeter is calculated as 2 times the sum of length and breadth.\n\nSo, let me write down what I know. Let me assign variables to the unknowns. Let's say the breadth is 'b' meters. Then the length would be four times that plus one, so length is 4b + 1.\n\nThe area is given as 150, which is length multiplied by breadth. So, equation-wise, that would be:\n\nArea = length \u00d7 breadth\n150 = (4b + 1) \u00d7 b\n\nLet me expand that equation. So, 150 = 4b\u00b2 + b.\n\nWait, that's a quadratic equation. To solve for 'b', I can rearrange it into standard quadratic form. Let's subtract 150 from both sides:\n\n4b\u00b2 + b - 150 = 0.\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation for 'b'. Quadratic equations can be solved using the quadratic formula, completing the square, or factoring if possible. Let me see if this factors neatly.\n\nI'll look for two numbers that multiply to (4 * -150) = -600 and add up to 1 (the coefficient of the middle term, which is +1). Hmm, factors of 600... Let's think. 25 and 24? Because 25 *24=600. But wait, I need them to add to 1. Hmm, 25 and 24: 25 -24 =1. Oh, because one is positive and the other is negative.\n\nSo, let's split the middle term using these. The equation is 4b\u00b2 + b -150 =0.\n\nSo, I can rewrite the equation as:\n\n4b\u00b2 +25b -24b -150 =0.\n\nWait, because 25b -24b is +b, which matches the original equation. Now, let's group terms:\n\n(4b\u00b2 +25b) - (24b +150) =0.\n\nFactor each group:\n\nb(4b +25) -6(4b +25) =0.\n\nAh, so both terms have (4b +25) as a factor. So, factor that out:\n\n(4b +25)(b -6) =0.\n\nSo, either 4b +25=0 or b-6=0.\n\n4b +25=0 \u2192 4b = -25 \u2192 b = -25/4.

Let me see if this factors neatly.\n\nI'll look for two numbers that multiply to (4 * -150) = -600 and add up to 1 (the coefficient of the middle term, which is +1). Hmm, factors of 600... Let's think. 25 and 24? Because 25 *24=600. But wait, I need them to add to 1. Hmm, 25 and 24: 25 -24 =1. Oh, because one is positive and the other is negative.\n\nSo, let's split the middle term using these. The equation is 4b\u00b2 + b -150 =0.\n\nSo, I can rewrite the equation as:\n\n4b\u00b2 +25b -24b -150 =0.\n\nWait, because 25b -24b is +b, which matches the original equation. Now, let's group terms:\n\n(4b\u00b2 +25b) - (24b +150) =0.\n\nFactor each group:\n\nb(4b +25) -6(4b +25) =0.\n\nAh, so both terms have (4b +25) as a factor. So, factor that out:\n\n(4b +25)(b -6) =0.\n\nSo, either 4b +25=0 or b-6=0.\n\n4b +25=0 \u2192 4b = -25 \u2192 b = -25/4. But breadth can't be negative, so discard this solution.\n\nThe other option: b-6=0 \u2192 b=6.\n\nSo, the breadth is 6 meters. Then, the length is 4 times that plus 1. So:\n\nLength =4*6 +1=24 +1=25 meters.\n\nNow, let's find the perimeter. Perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + breadth). So:\n\nPerimeter = 2*(25 +6) =2*(31) =62 meters.\n\nWait, looking at the options, C is 62 m. So the answer should be C.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I make mistakes.\n\nSo, if breadth is 6, length is 25. Area is 6*25=150, which matches the given area. So that's correct.\n\nPerimeter is 2*(25+6)=2*31=62 m. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer is C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let the breadth of the rectangle be \\( b \\) meters. The length is given as \\( 4b + 1 \\) meters. The area of the rectangle is \\( 150 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\), so the equation for the area is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{breadth}\n\\]\n\\[\n150 = (4b + 1) \\times b\n\\]\n\nExpanding and rearranging into standard quadratic form:\n\n\\[\n4b^2 + b - 150 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis quadratic equation can be solved by factoring. Looking for two numbers that multiply to \\( 4 \\times (-150) = -600 \\) and add to \\( 1 \\), the numbers \\( 25 \\) and \\( -24 \\) satisfy these conditions. Thus, the equation can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[\n4b^2 + 25b - 24b - 150 = 0\n\\]\n\nGrouping terms:\n\n\\[\n(4b^2 + 25b) - (24b + 150) = 0\n\\]\n\nFactoring each group:\n\n\\[\nb(4b + 25) - 6(4b + 25) = 0\n\\]\n\nFactoring out \\( (4b + 25) \\):\n\n\\[\n(4b + 25)(b - 6) = 0\n\\]\n\nSetting each factor to zero:\n\n1. \\( 4b + 25 = 0 \\) \u2192 \\( b = -\\frac{25}{4} \\) (not possible since breadth cannot be negative).\n2. \\( b - 6 = 0 \\) \u2192 \\( b = 6 \\).\n\nThus, the breadth is \\( 6 \\, \\text{m} \\), and the length is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Length} = 4b + 1 = 4(6) + 1 = 25 \\, \\text{m}.\n\\]\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{breadth}) = 2 \\times (25 + 6) = 2 \\times 31 = 62 \\, \\text{m}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the perimeter is \\( 62 \\, \\text{m} \\), and the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: C**",
