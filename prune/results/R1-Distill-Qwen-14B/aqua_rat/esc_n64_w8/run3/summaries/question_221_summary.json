      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about two numbers being in a certain ratio. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on ratios, but I think I can handle this.\n\nAlright, the problem says two numbers are in the ratio 3:5. Hmm, that means if I call the numbers something like 3x and 5x, right? Because ratios can be represented by multiplying a common factor. So, let's say the first number is 3x and the second is 5x. That makes sense because 3x/5x simplifies to 3/5.\n\nNow, the next part says if 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23. So, subtracting 9 from both numbers gives (3x - 9) and (5x - 9). And the ratio of these two new numbers is 12:23. \n\nSo, I can set up an equation here. The ratio (3x - 9)/(5x - 9) should equal 12/23. Let me write that down:\n\n(3x - 9)/(5x - 9) = 12/23.\n\nTo solve for x, I can cross-multiply. That would give me 23*(3x -9) = 12*(5x -9).\n\nLet me compute both sides. On the left side: 23*3x is 69x, and 23*(-9) is -207. On the right side: 12*5x is 60x, and 12*(-9) is -108. So putting it together:\n\n69x - 207 = 60x - 108.\n\nNow, I need to get all the x terms on one side and constants on the other. Subtract 60x from both sides:\n\n69x -60x -207 = -108 \u2192 9x -207 = -108.\n\nThen, add 207 to both sides:\n\n9x = -108 + 207.\n\nWait, what's 207 minus 108? Let me calculate. 207 - 108 is 99. So 9x = 99.\n\nDivide both sides by 9: x = 99/9 \u2192 x = 11. Oh, so x is 11.\n\nNow, the original numbers were 3x and 5x. So the smaller number is 3x. Plugging in x=11: 3*11=33. \n\nWait, let me double-check. So the original numbers are 33 and 55. Subtracting 9 gives 24 and 46. Are those in the ratio 12:23?\n\nLet me see: 24 divided by 12 is 2, and 46 divided by 23 is 2. So 24:46 is indeed 12:23. That checks out.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B is 33. So the smaller number is 33.\n",

So, if the ratio is 3:5, I can let the two numbers be 3x and 5x, where x is a common multiplier. That makes sense because 3x divided by 5x is 3/5, which is the given ratio.\n\nSo the two numbers are 3x and 5x. Now, according to the problem, if we subtract 9 from each, their new ratio becomes 12:23. Let me write that down as an equation.\n\nAfter subtracting 9, the numbers become (3x - 9) and (5x - 9).

So that's 60x - 108.\n\nSo now, the equation is 69x - 207 = 60x - 108.\n\nI need to get all the x terms on one side and constants on the other. Let's subtract 60x from both sides: 69x -60x is 9x, so 9x -207 = -108.\n\nNow, add 207 to both sides to isolate the term with x. So, 9x = -108 + 207. Let me calculate that: 207 minus 108 is 99.

That makes sense.\n\nNow, the problem says if 9 is subtracted from each, the new ratio becomes 12:23. So after subtracting 9, the numbers are (3x - 9) and (5x - 9), and their ratio is 12:23. \n\nI think I should set up an equation based on this. So, (3x - 9)/(5x - 9) = 12/23. Let me write that down.\n\nCross-multiplying to solve for x. So 23*(3x -9) = 12*(5x -9). Let me compute both sides.\n\nLeft side: 23*3x is 69x, and 23*(-9) is -207. So left side is 69x -207.\n\nRight side: 12*5x is 60x, and 12*(-9) is -108. So right side is 60x -108.\n\nSo the equation is 69x -207 = 60x -108. Let me bring like terms together. Subtract 60x from both sides: 9x -207 = -108. Then add 207 to both sides: 9x = 99. So x is 99/9 = 11.\n\nWait, x is 11? Let me check that again. 9x = 99, yes, so x=11. Okay, that makes sense.\n\nNow, the original numbers were 3x and 5x. So 3x is 3*11=33, and 5x is 5*11=55. So the smaller number is 33. Hmm, that's option B. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nWait, but let's verify the subtraction part. Subtract 9 from each: 33-9=24, and 55-9=46. What's the ratio of 24:46? Let's see, both are divisible by 2: 12:23. Oh, exactly the ratio given in the problem. So that checks out.\n\nSo the smaller number is 33, which is option B. But wait, looking at the options, B is 33, yes. So that's correct.\n\nWait a second, another way to approach this. Did I set up the ratio correctly? The original numbers are 3:5, so 3x and 5x. Subtracting 9 from each gives (3x-9)/(5x-9)=12/23. I think that's correct. Let me just re-calculate the cross-multiplication.\n\n23*(3x-9) = 69x - 207. 12*(5x-9) = 60x -108. So 69x -207 =60x -108. Subtract 60x: 9x -207 = -108. Add 207: 9x =99, x=11. Yep, same result.\n\nSo I'm confident the answer is B)33.\n",

Then, if 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23. I need to find the smaller number. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, ratios. Ratios can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that if two numbers are in a ratio, you can represent them as multiples of some variable. So, if the ratio is 3:5, I can think of the numbers as 3k and 5k, where k is a common multiplier. That makes sense because 3k divided by 5k is 3/5.\n\nSo, let me assign variables. Let the two numbers be 3k and 5k. Now, the problem says that when 9 is subtracted from each, the new ratio becomes 12:23. So, subtracting 9 from both, the new numbers are (3k - 9) and (5k - 9). And the ratio of these two is 12:23.\n\nSo, I can set up a proportion here. (3k - 9)/(5k - 9) = 12/23. Now, I need to solve for k.\n\nCross-multiplying to get rid of the fractions. So, 23*(3k -9) = 12*(5k -9). Let me compute each side.\n\nLeft side: 23 * 3k is 69k. 23 * (-9) is -207. So, 69k - 207.\n\nRight side: 12 *5k is 60k. 12*(-9) is -108. So, 60k -108.\n\nSo, the equation becomes 69k - 207 = 60k -108.\n\nNow, I'll bring like terms together. Subtract 60k from both sides: 69k -60k -207 = -108. So, 9k -207 = -108.\n\nThen, add 207 to both sides: 9k = -108 +207. Let me calculate that. 207 minus 108 is 99, so 9k = 99.\n\nDivide both sides by 9: k = 99/9. 99 divided by 9 is 11.

Both numbers are even, so divide numerator and denominator by 2: 12:23. Yes, that's exactly the ratio given in the problem. So it checks out.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, option B is 33. So that's the smaller number.\n\nBut wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes.

Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the smaller number is 33, which is option B.\n\n\nThe problem involves two numbers in the ratio 3:5, which can be represented as \\(3x\\) and \\(5x\\). When 9 is subtracted from each number, the new ratio becomes 12:23. Setting up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3x - 9}{5x - 9} = \\frac{12}{23}.\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\n\\[\n23(3x - 9) = 12(5x - 9).\n\\]\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\n\\[\n69x - 207 = 60x - 108.\n\\]\n\nSubtracting \\(60x\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n9x - 207 = -108.\n\\]\n\nAdding 207 to both sides:\n\n\\[\n9x = 99.\n\\]\n\nDividing by 9:\n\n\\[\nx = 11.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(x = 11\\) into the original numbers, the smaller number is:\n\n\\[\n3x = 3 \\times 11 = 33.\n\\]\n\nVerifying, subtracting 9 from both numbers gives 24 and 46, which simplifies to the ratio \\(12:23\\). Thus, the smaller number is \\(33\\), corresponding to option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

If 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23. We need to find the smaller number, and there are five options given.\n\nHmm, ratios can sometimes be tricky, but I think I can handle this. Let me think about how to approach it. Ratios often involve setting up some variables based on a common multiple. Since the original ratio is 3:5, maybe I can represent the two numbers as 3k and 5k, where k is some constant. That makes sense because 3k:5k simplifies to 3:5.\n\nSo, let's say the two numbers are 3k and 5k. Now, the problem states that when 9 is subtracted from each, their new ratio becomes 12:23. So subtracting 9 from both, we get (3k -9) and (5k -9), and their ratio is 12:23. \n\nI can set up a proportion here. So, (3k -9)/(5k -9) = 12/23. Now, I need to solve for k. Cross-multiplying should help. That would give me (3k -9) *23 = (5k -9)*12.\n\nLet me compute both sides. On the left side: 23*(3k) is 69k, and 23*(-9) is -207. So the left side is 69k -207. On the right side: 12*(5k) is 60k, and 12*(-9) is -108. So the right side is 60k -108.\n\nNow, putting it together: 69k -207 = 60k -108. I'll subtract 60k from both sides to get 9k -207 = -108. Then, add 207 to both sides: 9k = 99. Dividing both sides by 9 gives k = 11. \n\nWait, wait, let me double-check that math. 69k minus 60k is 9k. 207 minus 108 is 99. So yeah, 9k = 99, so k is 11. \n\nNow, the original numbers were 3k and 5k. So substituting k=11, the numbers are 3*11=33 and 5*11=55. So the smaller number is 33. Let me check the options. Option B is 33. \n\nBut wait, let me verify if subtracting 9 from each changes the ratio correctly. So 33-9=24 and 55-9=46. What's the ratio of 24:46? Let me simplify that. Both numbers are divisible by 2, so dividing by 2 gives 12:23. Yep, that's exactly what the problem states. So that's correct.\n\nSo the smaller number is 33, which is option B.\n",
