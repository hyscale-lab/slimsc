      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where a trader sold an article and made a 20% profit, and the selling price is Rs. 360. I need to find the cost price. Hmm, I remember that profit is calculated based on the cost price. Let me think about the formula.\n\nSo, profit percentage is (Profit / Cost Price) * 100. Oh wait, right, because profit is the amount gained over the cost. So if the selling price is cost plus profit, and the profit is 20% of the cost, then:\n\nSelling Price = Cost Price + 20% of Cost Price.\n\nWhich can be written as:\nSelling Price = Cost Price * (1 + 20/100)\nSelling Price = Cost Price * 1.2\n\nWait, yeah, because 20% is 0.2 in decimal. So the selling price is 120% of the cost price. So to find the cost price, I can rearrange the formula.\n\nSo, Cost Price = Selling Price / 1.2.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. Selling Price is 360.\n\nSo, Cost Price = 360 / 1.2. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 360 divided by 1.2. I can think of this as 360 divided by 6/5, which is same as 360 multiplied by 5/6.\n\nSo 360 * 5 = 1800, divided by 6 is 300. Oh, that makes sense. So the cost price is 300. Let me check the options. Option B is 300, so that should be the answer.\n\nWait, let me think again. Another way: if 20% profit on cost gives selling price 360, then 20% of cost is profit, and 120% is selling price. So 120% equals 360. Then 1% is 3, so 100% is 300. Yep, that matches. So definitely, the cost price is 300. So the correct option is B.\n",

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my profit and loss calculations, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nAlright, profit percentage is usually calculated on the cost price, right? So if the selling price is higher than the cost price, the profit is based on how much the cost was. Let me recall the formula. Profit percent equals (Profit / Cost Price) multiplied by 100. So, profit is Selling Price minus Cost Price.\n\nWait, the problem says a 20% profit. So I think the selling price is 120% of the cost price. Because 100% would be the cost, and 20% profit adds up to 120%. Oh right, that makes sense. So if I let the cost price be CP, then Selling Price (SP) is CP plus 20% of CP, which is 1.2 * CP.\n\nThe selling price here is given as Rs. 360. So I can set up the equation: 360 = 1.2 * CP. To find CP, I need to divide both sides by 1.2. Let me calculate that. 360 divided by 1.2. Hmm, 360 divided by 1.2 is the same as 360 * (10/12), because 1.2 is 12/10. Wait, no, 1.2 is 6/5, so dividing by 6/5 is the same as multiplying by 5/6. Let's see: 360 * (5/6) equals... 360 divided by 6 is 60, multiplied by 5 is 300. Oh, so the cost price is 300.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 300. That should be the correct answer. I think that's right. Let me double-check. If the cost price is 300, a 20% profit would be 60, so 300 +60=360, which matches the selling price given. Yep, that makes sense.\n",

So, the selling price is the cost price plus 20% of it. Oh right, the formula for profit is Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price.

Or another way, SP = CP + (20/100)*CP.\n\nAlternatively, I think the formula is SP = CP * (1 + Profit%). Since the profit is 20%, that would be 1.2 times the CP. So 360 equals 1.2 multiplied by CP.\n\nSo to find CP, I can rearrange that equation: CP = 360 / 1.2.\n\nLet me do the division. 360 divided by 1.2. Hmm, 1.2 times 300 is 360 because 1.2 * 300 = 360. So the cost price is Rs. 300.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 300. So the correct answer should be B.\n\n\nTo find the cost price (CP) of the article, we use the relationship between selling price (SP), cost price, and profit percentage. The selling price is given as Rs. 360, and the profit is 20%. The formula for selling price when a profit is made is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{SP} = \\text{CP} \\times (1 + \\text{Profit%})\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[\n360 = \\text{CP} \\times (1 + 0.20)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n360 = \\text{CP} \\times 1.20\n\\]\n\nSolving for CP:\n\n\\[\n\\text{CP} = \\frac{360}{1.20} = 300\n\\]\n\nThus, the cost price of the article is Rs. 300.\n\nAnswer: B",

I remember that profit is calculated based on the cost price. So the selling price is the cost plus 20% of the cost. \n\nWait, right. The formula I think is Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit. And the profit is 20% of the cost price. So maybe I can write it as:\n\nSelling Price = Cost Price \u00d7 (1 + Profit Percentage)\n\nOh wait, Profit Percentage is usually in decimal form. So 20% is 0.2. So the formula becomes Selling Price = Cost \u00d7 1.2.\n\nThey gave the Selling Price as Rs. 360. So I can plug that in. Let me write it down:\n\n360 = Cost \u00d7 1.2\n\nSo to find the Cost Price, I need to divide 360 by 1.2. Let me calculate that. 360 divided by 1.2. Hmm, 1.2 times 300 is 360, right?
