      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. The question is asking which of the given options is a multiple of X, but X has to be a number that's divisible by both 9 and 12. Hmm, wait, no, wait. Let me read that again. Oh right, it's asking which value is the multiple of X, and X itself must be divisible by 9 and 12. Or wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Let me rephrase the question.\n\nThe question says, \"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\" Wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Wait, perhaps it's that the value has to be a multiple of X, and X is a number that is itself divisible by 9 and 12. Or is it that the value is divisible by both 9 and 12, and is a multiple of X? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, let me parse the question again. It says, \"which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\" Oh, so the value (the options given) is a multiple of X, and that value is divisible by both 9 and 12. So the options are the values, and we need to find which one is a multiple of X, but the value (the option) must be divisible by 9 and 12. Oh, wait, that's not making sense because the options are numbers like 36, 15, etc. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the question is phrased differently. Let me think again. The question says, \"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12.\" So, the value is a multiple of X, and the value is divisible by 9 and 12. So, the value is a multiple of both X and (the LCM of 9 and 12). Or maybe X is the LCM of 9 and 12, and the value is a multiple of X. Wait, that makes more sense. Because the question is asking which option is a multiple of X, and X is a number that's divisible by 9 and 12. But wait, X must be the least common multiple of 9 and 12, right? Because if X is divisible by both, then the smallest X is LCM(9,12).\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"if it is divisible by 9 and 12.\" So perhaps the value (the option) is the multiple of X, and the value is also divisible by 9 and 12. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe X is a number such that X is divisible by both 9 and 12, and the value is a multiple of X. So X must be a common multiple of 9 and 12. Wait, but any common multiple would be a multiple of their LCM. The LCM of 9 and 12 is 36. So X could be 36, 72, etc. But the options given are 36, 15, 17, 5, 7. So looking for which option is a multiple of X. Wait, no, the options are the possible values of the multiple.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, the question says that X is a number that's divisible by 9 and 12. So X must be a common multiple of 9 and 12. The least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12 is 36. So X could be 36, 72, 108, etc.\n\nNow, the question is which of the options is a multiple of X. So the options are the possible multiples. Wait, but the options are single numbers like 36, 15, etc. So, if X is 36, then the options must be multiples of 36. Looking at the options, option A is 36, which is a multiple of 36. But wait, 36 is a multiple of itself, so that's correct. But let's check the other options.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"if it is divisible by 9 and 12\". So the value (the option) must be a multiple of X, which is itself a multiple of both 9 and 12. So the value must be a multiple of X, and X is a multiple of 9 and 12.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the value is a multiple of X, and the value is also divisible by 9 and 12. So the value must be a multiple of both X and the LCM of 9 and 12. But that seems a bit more complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.\n\nThe question is: Which value is a multiple of X, where X is divisible by 9 and 12. So X is a number that's a multiple of 9 and 12, so X is a common multiple of 9 and 12. So the smallest X is 36. Now, the options given are 36, 15, etc. So which of these options is a multiple of X (36, 72, etc.)?\n\nSo, looking at the options:\n\nA)36 \u2192 36 is a multiple of 36 (X=36), so yes.\n\nB)15 \u2192 15 is not a multiple of 36.\n\nC)17 \u2192 No.\n\nD)5 \u2192 No.\n\nE)7 \u2192 No.\n\nSo the only option that is a multiple of X (which is at least 36) is option A, 36.\n\nWait, but what if X is a larger multiple, like 72? Then 36 wouldn't be a multiple of 72. So if X is 72, then 36 is not a multiple of it. But the question is asking which of the options is a multiple of X. So if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple. But if X is 72, then none of the options would be a multiple of X because the options are 36, 15, etc. So the only possible X that allows any option to be a multiple is X=36.\n\nWait, but perhaps the question is phrased such that X is any number that is divisible by 9 and 12, and we need to find which option is a multiple of X. But if X can be 36, 72, etc., then only 36 (option A) is a multiple of 36. 15 is not a multiple of 36. So the correct answer would be A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is that the value is a multiple of X, and the value is itself divisible by 9 and 12. So the value is a multiple of X, and the value must be divisible by 9 and 12. So the value must be a common multiple of X and the LCM of 9 and 12 (which is 36). But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the options and see which of them are divisible by both 9 and 12. Because the question says that the value (the option) is divisible by 9 and 12. So the correct option must be a number that is divisible by both 9 and 12, making it a multiple of their LCM, which is 36. So let's check each option:\n\nOption A: 36. 36 \u00f7 9 =4, yes. 36 \u00f712=3, yes. So 36 is divisible by both.\n\nOption B:15. 15 \u00f79 is 1.666..., no. So not divisible by 9.\n\nOption C:17. Not divisible by 9 or 12.\n\nOption D:5. No.\n\nOption E:7. No.\n\nSo the only option that's divisible by both 9 and 12 is option A, 36. So if the value is 36, and it's a multiple of X, then X must be a divisor of 36. But wait, the question says X is divisible by 9 and 12. So X must be a multiple of 36 (since LCM of 9 and 12 is 36). So if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X (since 36 \u00d71=36). If X is 72, then 36 is not a multiple of 72. But since the options are fixed, the only possible X that allows the option to be a multiple is X=36.\n\nSo the correct answer is A)36.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine which of the given options is a multiple of X, where X is a number divisible by both 9 and 12. \n\n### Step 1: Determine the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12\nThe smallest number divisible by both 9 and 12 is their LCM. The prime factorization of 9 is \\(3^2\\), and the prime factorization of 12 is \\(2^2 \\times 3\\). The LCM is obtained by taking the highest powers of all prime factors:  \n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(9, 12) = 2^2 \\times 3^2 = 36\n\\]  \nThus, X must be a multiple of 36 (e.g., 36, 72, 108, etc.).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the options\nWe need to check which of the given options is a multiple of X. Since X is at least 36, the only option that satisfies this condition is 36 itself, as it is a multiple of 36 (specifically, \\(36 \\times 1 = 36\\)). The other options (15, 17, 5, 7) are not multiples of 36.\n\n### Step 3: Verify divisibility by 9 and 12\nAdditionally, the value must be divisible by both 9 and 12. Checking the options:\n- **Option A (36):**  \n  \\(36 \\div 9 = 4\\) (integer) and \\(36 \\div 12 = 3\\) (integer), so 36 is divisible by both 9 and 12.  \n- **Option B (15):**  \n  \\(15 \\div 9 = 1.666...\\) (not an integer), so 15 is not divisible by 9.  \n- **Option C (17):**  \n  \\(17 \\div 9 \\approx 1.888...\\) (not an integer), so 17 is not divisible by 9.  \n- **Option D (5):**  \n  \\(5 \\div 9 \\approx 0.555...\\) (not an integer), so 5 is not divisible by 9.  \n- **Option E (7):**  \n  \\(7 \\div 9 \\approx 0.777...\\) (not an integer), so 7 is not divisible by 9.\n\nOnly Option A (36) satisfies all conditions.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe correct answer is **A) 36**.  \nAnswer: A",

Let's consider that the value in the options is a multiple of X, and that same value is also divisible by 9 and 12. So, the value in the options must be a multiple of both X, 9, and 12. Or wait, no. The value must be a multiple of X, and also be divisible by 9 and 12. So, the value is a multiple of X and is also a multiple of 9 and 12.

So, the value must be a common multiple of X, 9, and 12.\n\nBut that's a bit abstract. Let me think of it another way. Let's say the value is Y, which is one of the options. Y is a multiple of X, and Y is divisible by 9 and 12. So, Y must be a multiple of the LCM of 9 and 12, which is 36. So, Y must be a multiple of 36.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question is: Find out which of the following values is a multiple of X, if it's divisible by 9 and 12. The options are A)36, B)15, C)17, D)5, E)7.\n\nHmm, wait, that wording is a bit confusing. So, the question is asking which value is a multiple of X, but X is the number that is divisible by both 9 and 12. So, X must be a common multiple of 9 and 12. Oh wait, no, actually, wait. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the question says, \"if it is divisible by 9 and 12.\" So, the value in the options is the multiple of X, and that value must be divisible by 9 and 12. Or is it the other way around? Hmm. Let me parse this again.\n\nThe question is: Which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\n\nSo, the value (the option) is a multiple of X, and that same value is divisible by 9 and 12. So, the options are the possible values, each of which must be a multiple of X, and each must also be divisible by 9 and 12. Or wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Let me try to rephrase.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking which of the options is a multiple of X, where X is a number that is divisible by both 9 and 12. So, X is a number that is a common multiple of 9 and 12. But then, the options are possible multiples of X. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's consider that the value in the options is a multiple of X, and that same value is also divisible by 9 and 12. So, the value in the options must be a multiple of both X, 9, and 12. Or wait, no. The value must be a multiple of X, and also be divisible by 9 and 12. So, the value is a multiple of X and is also a multiple of 9 and 12. So, X must be a factor of the value, and the value must be a common multiple of 9 and 12.\n\nWait, maybe the question is phrased as: Find the value (from the options) that is a multiple of X, given that X is divisible by 9 and 12. So, X is a number that is divisible by both 9 and 12. So X is a common multiple of 9 and 12. But wait, actually, if X is divisible by both 9 and 12, then X must be a common multiple. But the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12 is 36. Because 9 factors into 3^2 and 12 factors into 2^2 *3, so LCM is 2^2 *3^2=36. So X must be a multiple of 36.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if X is divisible by 9 and 12, then X is a multiple of the LCM of 9 and 12, which is 36. So X could be 36, 72, 108, etc. But the question is about the options given. The options are A)36, B)15, C)17, D)5, E)7. So the options are the possible values of X, perhaps? Or wait, no. Wait, the question says, which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12.\n\nWait, perhaps I got it wrong. Let me read it again: \"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\"\n\nSo, the value (from options) is a multiple of X, and that value is divisible by 9 and 12. So, the value must be a multiple of X and also a multiple of 9 and 12. So, X must be a factor of the value, and the value must be a common multiple of 9 and 12.\n\nSo, the value is a common multiple of 9 and 12, and also a multiple of X. So, X could be any factor of that value. But the question is to find which option is a multiple of X, given that the value is divisible by 9 and 12.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Maybe it's saying that the value is a multiple of X, and that value is also divisible by 9 and 12. So, the value is a multiple of both X and 9 and 12. So, the value must be a common multiple of X, 9, and 12.\n\nBut that's a bit abstract. Let me think of it another way. Let's say the value is Y, which is one of the options. Y is a multiple of X, and Y is divisible by 9 and 12. So, Y must be a multiple of the LCM of 9 and 12, which is 36. So, Y must be a multiple of 36. So, looking at the options, which one is a multiple of 36?\n\nThe options are 36,15,17,5,7.\n\nSo, 36 is a multiple of 36 (36*1=36), and 15,17,5,7 are not multiples of 36. So, the only option that is a multiple of 36 is option A)36. So, the correct answer must be A)36.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the question correctly. Because the question is asking which value is a multiple of X, given that it is divisible by 9 and 12. So, if the value is divisible by 9 and 12, then it must be a multiple of their LCM, which is 36. So, the value must be a multiple of 36. So, the options must be checked to see if any of them are multiples of 36. Only option A is 36, which is a multiple of 36. So, that must be the answer.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A)36.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine which value among the options is a multiple of \\( X \\), given that \\( X \\) is divisible by both 9 and 12. \n\n1. **Understanding the relationship**: If \\( X \\) is divisible by 9 and 12, then \\( X \\) must be a common multiple of these two numbers. The least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12 is calculated as follows:\n   - Prime factorization of 9: \\( 3^2 \\)\n   - Prime factorization of 12: \\( 2^2 \\times 3 \\)\n   - LCM of 9 and 12: \\( 2^2 \\times 3^2 = 36 \\)\n   Therefore, \\( X \\) must be a multiple of 36.\n\n2. **Analyzing the options**: The question asks which value is a multiple of \\( X \\). Since \\( X \\) is a multiple of 36, the value in question must also be a multiple of 36.

But wait, the question says that X is divisible by both 9 and 12. Hmm, I'm a bit confused because the problem statement is a bit unclear. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question is: Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12? The options are A)36, B)15, C)17, D)5, E)7.\n\nWait, so X is a number that is divisible by both 9 and 12. So X must be a common multiple of 9 and 12. Oh, wait no, actually, if a number is divisible by both 9 and 12, then X must be a multiple of their least common multiple (LCM). Because if X is divisible by both, then X is a common multiple.\n\nSo first, I need to find the LCM of 9 and 12. Let me think about that. The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both. To find the LCM of 9 and 12, I can break them down into their prime factors.\n\n9 is 3 squared, so 3^2. 12 is 2 squared times 3, which is 2^2 * 3^1. The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes present. So for 2, the highest power is 2^2, and for 3 it's 3^2. So LCM is 2^2 * 3^2 = 4 * 9 = 36. So the LCM of 9 and 12 is 36. That means X must be a multiple of 36. So X could be 36, 72, 108, etc.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of the options is a multiple of X. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Wait, the question says \"which of the following values is the multiple of X.\" So X is a multiple of 36, meaning X is 36 times some integer. So the options given are 36, 15, 17, 5, 7. So which of these is a multiple of X?\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because X is a multiple of 36, which is larger than all the options except maybe 36 itself. So if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X only if X is 36, because 36 is 1 times 36. But if X is a larger multiple, say 72, then none of the options are multiples of X because all options are less than 72 except 36, which is half of 72. So 36 is a multiple of X only if X is 36.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased a bit differently. Let me read it again: \"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\" Hmm, perhaps I misread the question. Maybe it's asking which of the options is a multiple of X, given that X is divisible by 9 and 12. So X is a multiple of 36, as before. So which of the options is a multiple of X?\n\nWait, but the options are 36,15,17,5,7. If X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X (36=1*36). If X is 72, then 36 is a divisor of X, not a multiple. So none of the options would be a multiple of X if X is greater than 36, except if X is exactly 36. Because 36 is a multiple of itself.\n\nSo the only way any of the options can be a multiple of X is if X is 36. Because then 36 is a multiple (36=1*36). But if X is larger than 36, like 72, then 36 isn't a multiple of 72. So the only possible option is 36 itself. So the correct answer would be A)36.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The problem says X is divisible by 9 and 12, so X must be a multiple of their LCM, which is 36. So X could be 36,72,108, etc. Now, the question is which of the options is a multiple of X. So for each option, we need to see if it is a multiple of X. Since X is at least 36, the only option that's >=36 is A)36. So 36 can be a multiple of X only if X is 36. Because if X is 72, then 36 is a factor, not a multiple. So the only possibility is when X is 36, and then 36 is a multiple.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A)36.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is asking which of the given options is a multiple of X, given that X is divisible by both 9 and 12. Hmm, I think I remember something about factors and multiples. Let me try to break this down.\n\nWait, wait. So X is divisible by 9 and 12. That means X must be a common multiple of 9 and 12. Oh right, the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both. So I should probably find the LCM of 9 and 12 first to figure out what X could be.\n\nLet me calculate the LCM of 9 and 12. I think the way to do that is by breaking them down into their prime factors. 9 is 3 squared, so 3^2. 12 can be broken down into 2^2 * 3^1. The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes present. So for 2, the highest power is 2^2, and for 3, it's 3^2. So 2^2 is 4, 3^2 is 9. Multiplying them together: 4 * 9 = 36. So the LCM is 36. That means X must be a multiple of 36. So X could be 36, 72, 108, etc.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking which option is a multiple of X. Oh, right! So the options given are possible values, and we need to see which one is a multiple of X. Wait, but X is a multiple of 36. So the options must be factors of X? Or maybe I'm getting it backwards.\n\nWait, no. The way the question is phrased: \"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\" Oh, so X is a number that is divisible by 9 and 12. So X must be a multiple of 36, as we found. The options are numbers that could be multiples of X. So each option is a value, and we have to see if any of them is a multiple of X.\n\nBut wait, if X is 36, then the options could be multiples of 36. Let's look at the options: A)36, B)15, C)17, D)5, E)7.\n\nWait, but if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X? No, wait. Because 36 is exactly X. So 36 is a multiple of X (since X is 36, 36 is 1 times X). So option A is 36, which would be a multiple of X. But what about the other options? Are any of them multiples of X?\n\nWait, but what if X is a larger multiple, like 72? Then, the options would need to be multiples of 72. Let's see: 36 is not a multiple of 72, because 36 is smaller than 72. 15 is way smaller, 17, 5, 7\u2014all are smaller than 36, so they can't be multiples of 72. So in that case, none of the options would be a multiple of X. But the question is asking which one is a multiple of X, so maybe there's only one possible option.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. X is a number divisible by both 9 and 12, so X must be a multiple of 36. The question is asking which of the options is a multiple of X. So the options are possible multiples of X. So for example, if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple (36*1), 72 is another (36*2), etc. But looking at the options, only 36 is in the options. So if X is 36, option A is a multiple. If X is 72, then none of the options are multiples of X because all options are smaller than 72. So the only possible option is A.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the question is that X is a number that is a multiple of both 9 and 12, which means X is a common multiple, but the options are possible X values. Wait, no, the question says \"which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\" So perhaps the options are possible X values, and we need to find which of them is a multiple of X. That doesn't make sense because if X is one of the options, like 36, then 36 is a multiple of itself.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me read the question again. \"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\"\n\nSo, the correct interpretation is: X is a number that is divisible by both 9 and 12. So X is a multiple of 36. Then, the question is which of the given options is a multiple of X. So, which option is a multiple of X, where X is a multiple of 36.\n\nSo, the options are A)36, B)15, C)17, D)5, E)7.\n\nSo, for each option, is it a multiple of X?\n\nBut since X is a multiple of 36, X could be 36, 72, 108, etc.\n\nIf X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X (since 36*1=36). So option A is correct.\n\nIf X is 72, then none of the options are multiples of 72 because all options are smaller than 72. So in that case, none of the options are correct. But the question gives options, so perhaps the only possible correct answer is A, because 36 is a multiple of X when X is 36. But if X is higher than 36, then none of the options are multiples. So how can the question have an answer?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the question is that X is a number that is a multiple of both 9 and 12, which means X is a multiple of 36. The options are numbers, and we need to find which is a multiple of X. So, which of the options is a multiple of X, where X is a multiple of 36.\n\nWait, that would mean the options must be multiples of X, which is a multiple of 36. So the options must be multiples of X. So the options must be multiples of X, which is itself a multiple of 36.\n\nWait, that can't be. Because if X is 36, then the options must be multiples of 36. Only option A is 36, which is a multiple of 36. The others are not.\n\nIf X is 72, then the options would have to be multiples of 72, but none are. So in that case, none are correct. But the problem is asking which of the options is a multiple of X, given that X is a multiple of 9 and 12.\n\nSo the only possible correct option is A, because when X is 36, 36 is a multiple. But what if X is 72? Then, none of the options are multiples of X, so the answer would be none of them. But since the options include A, which is 36, perhaps the intended answer is A.\n\nWait, but perhaps the question is phrased differently. Maybe the options are possible X values, and we have to find which is a multiple of X given that X is divisible by 9 and 12. Oh wait, that's a different interpretation. Let me re-read.\n\nThe question says, \"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\"\n\nSo the 'it' refers to X. So X is divisible by 9 and 12. So X is a multiple of 36. The options are possible X values. So, which of the options is a multiple of X, given that X is divisible by 9 and 12.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If X is a multiple of 36, then the options would be X's possible values, and which of them is a multiple of X. Wait, that can't be. Because if X is one of the options, like 36, then X is a multiple of itself. So 36 is a multiple of X=36. So option A would be correct.\n\nWait, but if X is 36, then the question is which of the options is a multiple of X. So if X is 36, then the options are 36, 15, 17, 5, 7. So which of these is a multiple of 36? Only 36 is a multiple of itself. So the correct answer would be A.\n\nBut let me think again. Suppose X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X. If X were 72, which is also a multiple of 36, then the options would have to be multiples of 72. But none of the options are 72, so in that case, none of the options would be multiples. But the options only include 36 as a possible multiple of X when X is 36.\n\nSo in any case, the only possible option that is a multiple of X is when X is 36, and the option is 36.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is asking which of the given options is a multiple of X, given that X is divisible by both 9 and 12. Hmm, I think I remember something about factors and multiples. Let me try to break this down.\n\nWait, wait. So X is divisible by 9 and 12. That means X must be a common multiple of 9 and 12. Oh right, the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both. So I should probably find the LCM of 9 and 12 first to figure out what X could be.\n\nLet me calculate the LCM of 9 and 12. I think the way to do that is by breaking them down into their prime factors. 9 is 3 squared, so 3^2. 12 can be broken down into 2^2 * 3^1. The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes present. So for 2, the highest power is 2^2, and for 3, it's 3^2. So 2^2 is 4, 3^2 is 9. Multiplying them together: 4 * 9 = 36. So the LCM is 36. That means X must be a multiple of 36. So X could be 36, 72, 108, etc.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking which option is a multiple of X. Oh, right! So the options given are possible values, and we need to see which one is a multiple of X. Wait, but X is a multiple of 36. So the options must be factors of X? Or maybe I'm getting it backwards.\n\nWait, no. The way the question is phrased: \"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\" Oh, so X is a number that is divisible by 9 and 12. So X must be a multiple of 36, as we found. The options are numbers that could be multiples of X. So each option is a value, and we have to see if any of them is a multiple of X.\n\nBut wait, if X is 36, then the options could be multiples of 36. Let's look at the options: A)36, B)15, C)17, D)5, E)7.\n\nWait, but if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X? No, wait. Because 36 is exactly X. So 36 is a multiple of X (since X is 36, 36 is 1 times X). So option A is 36, which would be a multiple of X. But what about the other options? Are any of them multiples of X?\n\nWait, but what if X is a larger multiple, like 72? Then, the options would need to be multiples of 72. Let's see: 36 is not a multiple of 72, because 36 is smaller than 72. 15 is way smaller, 17, 5, 7\u2014all are smaller than 36, so they can't be multiples of 72. So in that case, none of the options would be a multiple of X. But the question is asking which one is a multiple of X, so maybe there's only one possible option.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. X is a number divisible by both 9 and 12, so X must be a multiple of 36. The question is asking which of the options is a multiple of X. So the options are possible multiples of X. So for example, if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple (36*1), 72 is another (36*2), etc. But looking at the options, only 36 is in the options. So if X is 36, option A is a multiple. If X is 72, then none of the options are multiples of X because all options are smaller than 72. So the only possible option is A.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the question is that X is a number that is a multiple of both 9 and 12, which means X is a common multiple, but the options are possible X values. Wait, no, the question says \"which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\" So perhaps the options are possible X values, and we need to find which of them is a multiple of X. That doesn't make sense because if X is one of the options, like 36, then 36 is a multiple of itself.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me read the question again. \"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\"\n\nSo, the correct interpretation is: X is a number that is divisible by both 9 and 12. So X is a multiple of 36. Then, the question is which of the given options is a multiple of X. So, which option is a multiple of X, where X is a multiple of 36.\n\nSo, the options are A)36, B)15, C)17, D)5, E)7.\n\nSo, for each option, is it a multiple of X?\n\nBut since X is a multiple of 36, X could be 36, 72, 108, etc.\n\nIf X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X (since 36*1=36). So option A is correct.\n\nIf X is 72, then none of the options are multiples of 72 because all options are smaller than 72. So in that case, none of the options are correct. But the question gives options, so perhaps the only possible correct answer is A, because 36 is a multiple of X when X is 36. But if X is higher than 36, then none of the options are multiples. So how can the question have an answer?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the question is that X is a number that is a multiple of both 9 and 12, which means X is a multiple of 36. The options are numbers, and we need to find which is a multiple of X. So, which of the options is a multiple of X, where X is a multiple of 36.\n\nWait, that would mean the options must be multiples of X, which is a multiple of 36. So the options must be multiples of X. So the options must be multiples of X, which is itself a multiple of 36.\n\nWait, that can't be. Because if X is 36, then the options must be multiples of 36. Only option A is 36, which is a multiple of 36. The others are not.\n\nIf X is 72, then the options would have to be multiples of 72, but none are. So in that case, none are correct. But the problem is asking which of the options is a multiple of X, given that X is a multiple of 9 and 12.\n\nSo the only possible correct option is A, because when X is 36, 36 is a multiple. But what if X is 72? Then, none of the options are multiples of X, so the answer would be none of them. But since the options include A, which is 36, perhaps the intended answer is A.\n\nWait, but perhaps the question is phrased differently. Maybe the options are possible X values, and we have to find which is a multiple of X given that X is divisible by 9 and 12. Oh wait, that's a different interpretation. Let me re-read.\n\nThe question says, \"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\"\n\nSo the 'it' refers to X. So X is divisible by 9 and 12. So X is a multiple of 36. The options are possible X values. So, which of the options is a multiple of X, given that X is divisible by 9 and 12.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If X is a multiple of 36, then the options would be X's possible values, and which of them is a multiple of X. Wait, that can't be. Because if X is one of the options, like 36, then X is a multiple of itself. So 36 is a multiple of X=36. So option A would be correct.\n\nWait, but if X is 36, then the question is which of the options is a multiple of X. So if X is 36, then the options are 36, 15, 17, 5, 7. So which of these is a multiple of 36? Only 36 is a multiple of itself. So the correct answer would be A.\n\nBut let me think again. Suppose X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X. If X were 72, which is also a multiple of 36, then the options would have to be multiples of 72. But none of the options are 72, so in that case, none of the options would be multiples. But the options only include 36 as a possible multiple of X when X is 36.\n\nSo in any case, the only possible option that is a multiple of X is when X is 36, and the option is 36. So the answer should be A.\n\n\nTo determine which of the given options is a multiple of \\( X \\), we first note that \\( X \\) is divisible by both 9 and 12.

Let me break it down.\n\nWait, so X is a number that's divisible by 9 and 12. Oh right, if a number is divisible by multiple numbers, it's a common multiple of those.

Let me read it again.\n\nThe question is: Which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\n\nHmm, wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh right, the question is asking which of the options is a multiple of X, where X is a number that is divisible by both 9 and 12. So X has to be a common multiple of 9 and 12, but I think they mean the least common multiple (LCM) because otherwise, X could be any multiple of the LCM. Wait, no, the question says X is divisible by 9 and 12, so X must be a common multiple of both. But the question is about which option is a multiple of X. So each option is a number, and we need to see if it's a multiple of X.\n\nWait, no, maybe I got that reversed. Let me think again. The problem states: \"if it is divisible by 9 and 12.\" Oh wait, perhaps the 'it' refers to the value in the options. Or wait, maybe the problem is phrased differently. Let me parse the question again.\n\nWait, the question is: \"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\" So the value in the options is a multiple of X, and that same value is divisible by 9 and 12. Or wait, perhaps the value is a multiple of X, and X is a number that is divisible by 9 and 12. So X must be a common multiple of 9 and 12, but since we're looking for the multiple of X, the options must be multiples of X.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, find X. X is divisible by both 9 and 12. So X must be a common multiple of 9 and 12. But wait, the smallest such number is the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12. So let's calculate that.\n\nThe LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both. To find LCM of 9 and 12, I can factor them into primes.\n\n9 factors into 3^2.\n12 factors into 2^2 * 3^1.\n\nThe LCM takes the highest power of each prime present. So for 2, it's 2^2 (from 12), and for 3, it's 3^2 (from 9). So LCM = 2^2 *3^2 = 4 *9 = 36.\n\nSo the LCM of 9 and 12 is 36. Therefore, X must be a multiple of 36. Because any number divisible by both 9 and 12 must be a multiple of 36.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as X being a number that is divisible by 9 and 12. So X could be 36, 72, 108, etc. But the options given are 36, 15, 17, 5, 7. So the options are the possible values that are multiples of X.\n\nWait, no, the options are the possible values that are multiples of X. Because the question says, \"which of the following values is the multiple of X.\" So each option is a candidate for being a multiple of X. So X is a number that is itself divisible by 9 and 12. So X is a multiple of 36. Then, the options must be multiples of X.\n\nWait, but the options are A)36, B)15, C)17, D)5, E)7.\n\nSo let's think: if X is a multiple of 36, then any multiple of X must be a multiple of 36.

Let me think again. If X is 36, then a multiple of X would be 36, 72, 108, etc. So the options given must be one of these. Only A is 36, which is X itself. So it's a multiple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that X is a multiple of 36, and the options are the numbers that are multiples of X. So the options are the candidates, and we have to pick which one is a multiple of X.\n\nWait, but if X is a multiple of 36, say X=72, then 36 is not a multiple of 72. Because 72 is larger than 36. So 36 would not be a multiple of X=72. So if X is a higher multiple of 36, like 72, then which options are multiples of 72?\n\nLooking at the options, 36 is 36, which is less than 72. So 36 is not a multiple of 72. 15, 17, 5,7 are all smaller than 72 and not multiples.\n\nWait, so this is confusing.

So, for example, if X is 36, then option A)36 is a multiple of X (since 36 = 36*1). If X is 72, then none of the options are multiples of 72, because all options are smaller than 72.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"if it is divisible by 9 and 12\", which implies that the value (the option) is the one that must be divisible by 9 and 12.

Let's think: for a value (the option) to be a multiple of X, and the value itself is divisible by 9 and 12, then X must be a divisor of that value.\n\nBut since X is also divisible by 9 and 12, the value must be a common multiple of X, 9, and 12. Hmm, maybe this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking: among the options, which number is a multiple of X, where X is a number that is itself a multiple of both 9 and 12.\n\nSo, X must be a multiple of 36. So the options must be multiples of X. But the options are 36,15,17,5,7.\n\nIf X is 36, then the options must be multiples of 36. The only one is 36 (option A). If X is 72, then none of the options are multiples of 72. If X is 108, same thing.\n\nSo the only possible option is A)36, because if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is that X is a number that is divisible by 9 and 12, and the options are numbers that are multiples of X. So which of the options is a multiple of X.\n\nBut the problem is that X could be any multiple of 36, so the options must be multiples of X. But the options are fixed, so the only way for an option to be a multiple of X is if X is a divisor of that option.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So for each option, we can check if X is a divisor of that option. But since X must be a multiple of 36, the option must be a multiple of 36, because X is at least 36.\n\nSo which of the options is a multiple of 36? Only option A)36 is 36*1. The others are 15 (which is less than 36 and not a multiple), 17 (same), 5, and 7.\n\nSo the correct answer must be A)36.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. If the options are possible multiples of X, and X is a multiple of 36, then the option must be a multiple of X. But X could be any multiple of 36. For example, if X is 36, the options are 36,15,17,5,7. Only 36 is a multiple of X=36. If X is 72, then none of the options are multiples of 72, because all are less than 72 except 36, which is 36=72*(0.5), which is not an integer multiple. So 36 is not a multiple of 72.\n\nSo the only case where an option is a multiple of X is when X is 36, and the option is 36. Therefore, the correct answer is A)36.\n",

Because 9 is 3^2, 12 is 2^2 *3^1. So LCM is 2^2 *3^2 = 36. So any multiple of 36 will be divisible by both 9 and 12. So X must be 36, 72, 108, etc. So the options are 36,15,17,5,7.\n\nSo the question is, which of these is a multiple of X, where X is a multiple of 36.

So 36 is a multiple of X=36. So option A is 36, which is a multiple of X=36. So the answer would be A.\n\nWait, but the options are the values that are multiples of X, not X itself. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me read the question again: \"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\"\n\nWait, perhaps the question is: Which of the options is a multiple of X, and that option is also divisible by 9 and 12. So X is a number, and the option is a multiple of X, and that option is also divisible by 9 and 12. So the option must be a common multiple of X, 9, and 12.\n\nBut without knowing X, how can we proceed? That can't be. So perhaps the question is phrased differently. Oh wait, maybe the question is: Which of the following values is a multiple of X, given that X is divisible by both 9 and 12.\n\nWait, so X is a number that is divisible by both 9 and 12, so X is a common multiple of 9 and 12, like 36, 72, etc. The options are possible values, and we need to find which option is a multiple of X. So, for example, if X is 36, then the options must be multiples of 36. So looking at the options, 36 is option A. 36 is 36 * 1, so yes. So 36 is a multiple of X=36. The other options are 15, which is less than 36 and not a multiple. So if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X. So A is the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the question is that X is a number that is a multiple of both 9 and 12, and the options are possible X's. So which of the options is a multiple of both 9 and 12. Then the correct answer would be 36 (option A), because 36 is the LCM of 9 and 12. So 36 is divisible by both 9 and 12, and the other options are not. So the correct answer is A.\n\nWait, but the way the question is phrased is a bit confusing. Let me try to parse it again: \"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\" So perhaps the \"it\" refers to X. So X is a multiple of 9 and 12, and the options are possible multiples of X. So the options are numbers that are multiples of X, which is a multiple of 9 and 12. So the options must be multiples of a number that's already a multiple of 36. So the options must be multiples of 36. So among the options, only 36 is a multiple of 36 (since 36*1=36). The other options are 15, which is less than 36, so not a multiple of 36. So the answer is A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is the other way around: X is a number that is a multiple of the given options, and X is divisible by 9 and 12. So which of the options can be a divisor of X, where X is divisible by 9 and 12. But that would be a different question. Let me think: X is divisible by both 9 and 12, so X is a multiple of 36. So the options are possible divisors of X. So which of the options is a divisor of 36? Because X could be 36, 72, etc.\n\nLooking at the options: 36 (divides 36), 15 (does 15 divide 36? 36 \u00f715 = 2.4, no. 17? 36 \u00f717 is about 2.117, no. 5? 36/5=7.2, no. 7? 36/7\u22485.14, no. So only option A)36 is a divisor of X=36. So the answer is A.\n\nSo whether the question is asking which option is a multiple of X (where X is a multiple of 36) or which option is a divisor of X (where X is a multiple of 36), the correct answer is A)36.\n\nWait, but in the first scenario, the option must be a multiple of X. So if X is 36, the options are 36 (yes), 15 (no), etc. So A is correct. If X is 72, then 36 is a multiple of X (72)? No, because 36 is less than 72, so 36 can't be a multiple of 72. So if X is 72, then none of the options are multiples of X except maybe none. But wait, the options are given, so perhaps X must be the smallest possible, which is 36. So the only possible option that is a multiple of X is 36 itself. So answer is A.\n",

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking which of the options is a multiple of X, where X itself is a number divisible by 9 and 12. So, X must be a common multiple of 9 and 12. Or wait, perhaps X is a number that is divisible by 9 and 12, meaning X is a multiple of both. So, X must be a common multiple of 9 and 12.\n\nWait, but the options are the possible X values, and the question is which of them is a multiple of X. No, wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Let me read it again.\n\nWait, the question says, \"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\" So, perhaps it's phrased as, X is a number that is divisible by 9 and 12. Then, among the options, which one is a multiple of X. So, the options are numbers, and we need to see which is a multiple of X, where X is a number divisible by both 9 and 12.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because if X is, say, 36, then which option is a multiple of 36? Let me see the options: A)36, B)15, C)17, D)5, E)7. So, if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X (since 36 \u00d71=36), so A would be a multiple of X. But that seems circular. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the question is, given that a certain number is a multiple of X, and that X is divisible by 9 and 12, which of the options is that number?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is: Find which of the options is a multiple of X, where X is a number that is divisible by both 9 and 12. So, the options are the possible multiples of X. So, which of the options is a multiple of X, given that X is a common multiple of 9 and 12. Hmm, but that might not be the right way to think about it. Alternatively, perhaps X is the least common multiple of 9 and 12, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me think about what it means for X to be divisible by both 9 and 12. So, X must be a common multiple of 9 and 12. The least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12 is 36. So, X could be 36, 72, 108, etc. Now, the options given are 36, 15, 17, 5, 7. So, which of these is a multiple of X. But wait, if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X (since 36 \u00d71=36). So, if the options are possible multiples of X, then 36 would be a multiple. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking, which of the options is a multiple of both 9 and 12. Because if X is a number that is divisible by 9 and 12, then any multiple of X would also be divisible by 9 and 12. So, the options are the numbers, and we need to find which is divisible by both 9 and 12. So, for each option, check if it's divisible by both 9 and 12.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if the question is, which of the following values is a multiple of X, where X is divisible by 9 and 12. But then, perhaps the options are the multiples of X, and X itself is the LCM of 9 and 12. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct interpretation is that X is a number that is divisible by both 9 and 12, so X must be a common multiple of 9 and 12. The smallest such X is 36. So, if X is 36, then the options are possible multiples of X. So, which option is a multiple of 36? Looking at the options: 36 is 36 \u00d71, which is a multiple. 15 is not a multiple of 36. 17 is not. 5 is not. 7 is not. So, the only option that is a multiple of 36 is option A)36.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased such that X is a number, and the options are possible values of X, which must be divisible by both 9 and 12. So, in that case, which of the options is divisible by both 9 and 12. Let me check each option.\n\nOption A)36: 36 divided by 9 is 4, so yes. 36 divided by 12 is 3, yes. So 36 is divisible by both.\n\nOption B)15: 15 divided by 9 is 1.666..., so no. So it's not divisible by 9, so not X.\n\nOption C)17: 17 divided by 9 is about 1.888..., no. So not.\n\nOption D)5: 5 divided by 9 is less than 1, so no.\n\nOption E)7: same as D, no.\n\nSo, only option A)36 is divisible by both 9 and 12. So, if the question is asking which of the options is a value of X that is divisible by 9 and 12, then the answer is A)36.\n\nWait, but the original question says, \"which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\" So, perhaps the wording is tricky. So, X is a number that is divisible by 9 and 12, so X could be 36, 72, etc. Then, the question is which of the options is a multiple of X. So, if X is 36, then a multiple of X would be 36, 72, 108, etc. Among the options, 36 is an option (A), so the answer would be A.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is asking for the value of X that is a multiple of both 9 and 12, then the answer is 36.\n\nWait, but perhaps the correct approach is that X is a number that is divisible by 9 and 12, which means X must be a common multiple of 9 and 12. So, the least such X is 36. Then, the question is which of the options is a multiple of X. So, the options are possible multiples of X. But if X is 36, then which of the options is a multiple of 36? Only 36 itself is in the options. So, the answer is A.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to rephrase the problem.\n\nThe problem is: Which of the following values is a multiple of X, if X is divisible by 9 and 12.\n\nSo, X is divisible by both 9 and 12. Therefore, X must be a common multiple of 9 and 12, so the smallest is 36. Then, the question is, which of the options is a multiple of X. So, the options are possible multiples of X. So, 36 is a multiple of X (36 \u00d71 = 36), but if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X. So, option A is a multiple of X.\n\nBut wait, this seems a bit circular. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is phrased as: which of the options is a multiple of X, given that X is divisible by 9 and 12. So, if X is a common multiple of 9 and 12, then any multiple of X would also be a multiple of both 9 and 12. So, the options are numbers, and we need to find which is a multiple of both 9 and 12.\n\nSo, if the options are 36,15,17,5,7, then which of these is a multiple of both 9 and 12?\n\nWell, 36 is 36, which is 9\u00d74 and 12\u00d73. So yes, 36 is divisible by both 9 and 12.\n\n15: 15 \u00f79 is 1.666..., not an integer. So no.\n\n17: same, not divisible by 9 or 12.\n\n5 and 7: same.\n\nSo, only 36 is divisible by both 9 and 12. So, the answer would be A)36.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased as \"which of the following is a multiple of X, where X is divisible by 9 and 12.\" So, X could be 36, 72, etc. So, the options are the multiples of X, so 36 is a multiple of X when X is 36. So, 36 is a multiple of X, which is 36. So, the answer is A.\n\nWait, but if X is 72, then 36 is not a multiple of X (since 36 is less than 72), so 36 wouldn't be a multiple of 72. So, perhaps X must be the least common multiple, which is 36, so the only option that's a multiple of X is 36 itself.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the correct answer is A)36.\n\n\nTo determine which of the given options is a multiple of \\( X \\), where \\( X \\) is divisible by both 9 and 12, we first recognize that \\( X \\) must be a common multiple of 9 and 12. The least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12 is 36. Therefore, \\( X \\) could be 36, 72, 108, etc.\n\nThe question then asks which of the options is a multiple of \\( X \\). Among the given options:\n\n- **A) 36**: This is exactly equal to 36, which is a multiple of \\( X \\) (since \\( 36 \\times 1 = 36 \\)).\n- **B) 15**: 15 is not a multiple of 36.\n- **C) 17**: 17 is not a multiple of 36.\n- **D) 5**: 5 is not a multiple of 36.\n- **E) 7**: 7 is not a multiple of 36.\n\nThus, the only option that is a multiple of \\( X \\) (where \\( X \\) is divisible by both 9 and 12) is **36**.\n\nAnswer: A",
