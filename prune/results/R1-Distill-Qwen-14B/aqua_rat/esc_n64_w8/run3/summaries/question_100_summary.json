      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so Roy has a problem with severe headaches, and he goes to the doctor. The doctor gives him five tablets and tells him to take one every fifteen minutes. Now, the question is asking how much time it will take Roy to consume all five tablets. Hmm, let me think about this.\n\nWait, when the doctor says to take one every fifteen minutes, that probably means he takes the first one right away and then the next ones every 15 minutes after that. So let's break it down. The first tablet is taken at time zero, right? Then the next one at 15 minutes, then another at 30, 45, and 60 minutes. Wait, wait, wait. Because if he takes the first tablet now, the second is in 15, third in 30, fourth in 45, and fifth in 60. So the last tablet is taken at 60 minutes. So the total time from when he starts the first tablet to finishing the fifth is 60 minutes. \n\nBut wait, another way to think: if he takes one every 15 minutes, how many intervals are there between the first and the last tablet? Let's see, for five tablets, the number of intervals is four. Because first tablet at 0, then four more at 15, 30, 45, 60. Oh right, so the intervals are four times 15 minutes. 4 *15=60 minutes. So the time taken is 60 minutes. \n\nLooking at the options, option E is 60 minutes. So the answer should be E. \n\nWait, but sometimes people might think it's 5 times 15, which is 75 minutes. Oh, but that would be the case if the first tablet is taken at the end of the first 15 minutes. No, no, because if you take the first tablet immediately, the next ones follow every 15 minutes. So the first one is at 0, the second at 15, third at 30, fourth at 45, fifth at 60. So the last one is at 60, which means the total time from the start is 60 minutes.

The question is, how much time will it take Roy to consume all five tablets? Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nLet me think. So, he has five tablets. He takes one every 15 minutes. Wait, but when does he start taking them? Like, does he take the first tablet immediately, then the next after 15 minutes, and so on? Or does the timing start after the first one?\n\nWait, if he takes the first tablet right away, then the next one after 15 minutes, the third after another 15, and so on. So, let's count the intervals. For five tablets, how many intervals are there between them?\n\nOh right, because the first tablet doesn't require waiting. So, between tablet 1 and 2 is 15 minutes. Tablet 2 to 3 is another 15, and so on. So for five tablets, the number of intervals is 5 minus 1, which is 4. Each interval is 15 minutes, so 4 times 15 is 60 minutes. So total time is 60 minutes.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Let me make sure. Suppose he takes the first tablet at time zero. Then the next at 15, then 30, 45, and 60. Wait, that's five tablets. So the times would be 0, 15, 30, 45, 60. So the last tablet is at 60 minutes. But the question is, how much time will it take him to consume all five? So the total time from the first to the last is 60 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, some might think that each tablet takes 15 minutes apart, so five tablets would be 5 * 15 =75 minutes. But that's not correct because the first one is taken at time zero, and the subsequent ones follow. So the time from the first to the last is four intervals, each 15 minutes, totaling 60 minutes.\n\nSo looking at the options, option E is 60 minutes. Option A is 45, which is too short.

The question is, how much time will it take Roy to consume all five tablets? Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nLet me think. So, he has five tablets. He takes one every 15 minutes. Wait, but when does he start taking them? Like, does he take the first tablet immediately, then the next after 15 minutes, and so on? Or does the timing start after the first one?\n\nWait, if he takes the first tablet right away, then the next one after 15 minutes, the third after another 15, and so on. So, let's count the intervals. For five tablets, how many intervals are there between them?\n\nOh right, because the first tablet doesn't require waiting. So, between tablet 1 and 2 is 15 minutes. Tablet 2 to 3 is another 15, and so on. So for five tablets, the number of intervals is 5 minus 1, which is 4. Each interval is 15 minutes, so 4 times 15 is 60 minutes. So total time is 60 minutes.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Let me make sure. Suppose he takes the first tablet at time zero. Then the next at 15, then 30, 45, and 60. Wait, that's five tablets. So the times would be 0, 15, 30, 45, 60. So the last tablet is at 60 minutes. But the question is, how much time will it take him to consume all five? So the total time from the first to the last is 60 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, some might think that each tablet takes 15 minutes apart, so five tablets would be 5 * 15 =75 minutes. But that's not correct because the first one is taken at time zero, and the subsequent ones follow. So the time from the first to the last is four intervals, each 15 minutes, totaling 60 minutes.\n\nSo looking at the options, option E is 60 minutes. Option A is 45, which is too short.

I need to figure out how long it will take him to consume all five. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the situation. He has five tablets to take. He takes them one after another, each 15 minutes apart. Wait, but when exactly does he take the first one? Let's say he starts at time zero. So the first tablet is taken immediately, right?\n\nSo the first tablet is at time 0 minutes. Then the second one after 15 minutes, which would be at 15 minutes. Third one would be 15 minutes after that, so at 30 minutes. Fourth at 45 minutes, and the fifth at 60 minutes. Wait, so the last tablet is taken at 60 minutes. But how much time does it take in total from start to finish?\n\nWait, but the question is asking how much time it will take Roy to consume all the tablets. So the total time is from the first tablet to the last one. So the first is at 0, and the fifth at 60. So the duration is 60 minutes. But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.\n\nAnother way to think about it: how many intervals are there between the tablets. Since he takes five tablets, the number of intervals between them is four. Each interval is 15 minutes, so 4 * 15 = 60 minutes. That makes sense. So the total time from the first to the last dose is 60 minutes. Therefore, the answer should be 60 minutes, which is option E.\n\nBut wait, another thought: does the time start after the first tablet? Like, maybe the first tablet is taken at time zero, then the next at 15, then 30, 45, and 60. So the total time taken is 60 minutes. Because the first one is at time zero, so the last one is at 60. So the total duration is 60 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, if someone thinks that the first tablet takes 15 minutes to take, but that doesn't make sense because taking a tablet is an instantaneous action, not a time-consuming process. So the time between doses is 15 minutes, not the time taken to consume each tablet.\n\nSo the correct answer is 60 minutes. Looking at the options, option E is 60 min. So the answer should be E.\n",
