      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says an organization wants to raise Rs. 6 lakh by collecting equal contributions from each employee. If each employee had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the total would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. We need to find out how many employees there are.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. So, the first scenario is the initial contribution where each employee gives a certain amount, and the total is 6 lakh. The second scenario is each employee giving 60 rupees more, leading to a total of 6.24 lakh. \n\nI think I can set up some equations here. Let's say the number of employees is N, and the contribution each person initially makes is x rupees. So, in the first case, the total contribution is N multiplied by x, which equals 6 lakh. So the equation would be N * x = 6,00,000. \n\nIn the second case, each person contributes 60 rupees more, so each contributes (x + 60). The total then becomes N * (x + 60) = 6,24,000. \n\nSo now I have two equations:\n1) N * x = 6,00,000\n2) N * (x + 60) = 6,24,000\n\nHmm, I can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate N, maybe. Let's see.\n\nEquation 2 minus Equation 1 gives:\nN*(x +60) - N*x = 6,24,000 - 6,00,000\nSimplify left side: N*(x +60 -x) = N*60\nRight side: 24,000\n\nSo N * 60 = 24,000\nThen N = 24,000 / 60\nLet me calculate that. 24,000 divided by 60. 60 goes into 240 four times, so 24,000 is 240*100. So 4*100 =400. Wait, no, wait. 60 times 400 is 24,000. Because 60 * 400 is 24,000. So N is 400.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So the number of employees is 400. Let me check the options. Option C is 400. So that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me plug the numbers back in.\n\nIf N is 400, then in the first case, each contributes x = 6,00,000 /400 = 1,500 rupees. Because 400 * 1500 is 600,000. \n\nIn the second case, each contributes 1500 +60 = 1560. So total is 400 * 1560. Let me calculate that. 1560 * 400 = 6,24,000. Which matches the given second total. So yes, that checks out.\n\nSo the answer is option C, 400 employees.\n",

Let me read it again.\n\nThe organization wants to raise Rs. 6 lakh by getting equal contributions from each employee. Oh right, 1 lakh is 100,000, so 6 lakh is 600,000. Then, it says if each employee had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the total would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. So 6.24 lakh is 624,000. The question is, how many employees are there?\n\nHmm. So I think I need to set up an equation here. Let me denote the number of employees as 'n'. And the original contribution per employee as 'x'. \n\nSo the first scenario: total contribution is 6 lakh. So n multiplied by x equals 600,000. So equation one is n * x = 600,000.\n\nIn the second scenario, each contributes Rs.60 extra, so each contributes (x +60). The total then becomes 624,000. So equation two is n*(x +60) = 624,000.\n\nNow, I can subtract equation one from equation two to eliminate the total amount.

Then n = 24,000 /60. Let's calculate that. 24,000 divided by 60. 60 goes into 24000 how many times? Well, 60 *400 is 24,000 because 60*4 is 240, so 60*400=24,000. So n is 400.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If n is 400, then the original contribution per person is 600,000 /400 = 1500. Then, each contributes 60 extra, so 1500+60=1560. Multiply by 400: 400 *1560. Let me compute that. 400 *1500 is 600,000, and 400 *60 is 24,000. So 600k +24k =624k, which matches the given value. So yes, 400 employees.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about an organization raising money through employee contributions. Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nSo the problem says the organization wants to raise Rs. 6 lakh. That's 600,000 rupees, right? They're collecting equal contributions from each employee. Let's call the number of employees 'n' and the amount each contributes 'x'. So the total contribution would be n multiplied by x, and that equals 6 lakh. So my first equation is n * x = 600,000.\n\nThen, the problem adds another condition. If each employee had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the total contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. Wait, 6.24 lakh is 624,000. So in this case, each employee gives x + 60 rupees. The new total is n multiplied by (x + 60), which equals 624,000. So my second equation is n*(x +60) = 624,000.\n\nHmm, so I have two equations:\n\n1. n * x = 600,000\n2. n * (x + 60) = 624,000\n\nI can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate n. Let's see:\n\nn*(x +60) - n*x = 624,000 - 600,000\nThat simplifies to n*60 = 24,000.\n\nOh, because when you subtract, the x terms cancel out, leaving 60n = 24,000. So solving for n, I divide both sides by 60.\n\nn = 24,000 / 60. Let me compute that. 24,000 divided by 60. Well, 60 times 400 is 24,000, because 60*400=24,000. So n equals 400.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If there are 400 employees, each contributing x. So 400x = 600,000. Solving for x, x = 600,000 /400. Let's see, 600,000 divided by 400. 400 goes into 600,000 how many times? Well, 400 * 1500 = 600,000 because 400*1000=400,000, 400*500=200,000. So 1000+500=1500. So x is 1500.\n\nNow, if each contributes 60 more, that's 1560. 400 employees times 1560 is 400 * 1560. Let me calculate that. 400 * 1500 is 600,000, and 400 *60 is 24,000.

Then, it mentions that if each employee had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the total contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. The question is asking how many employees are in the organization, with the options given.\n\nHmm, okay, so let's break this down. I think I'll start by defining some variables to represent the unknowns. Let's say the number of employees is N, and each employee contributes X rupees. \n\nSo, according to the first part of the problem, the total contribution is Rs. 6 lakh. Since each employee contributes X, the total is N multiplied by X. So that equation would be:\n\nN * X = 600,000 (since 6 lakh is 600,000 rupees)\n\nThen, the second scenario says that if each employee contributed Rs. 60 more, the total would be Rs. 6.24 lakh. So in this case, each employee's contribution becomes X + 60, and the new total is 624,000 rupees. So the second equation would be:\n\nN * (X + 60) = 624,000\n\nNow I have two equations with two variables. I can solve these simultaneously to find N.\n\nLet me write them again:\n\n1) N * X = 600,000\n2) N * (X + 60) = 624,000\n\nI can subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate N*X. Let's see:\n\nEquation 2 minus equation 1:\nN*(X + 60) - N*X = 624,000 - 600,000\nN*(X + 60 - X) = 24,000\nN*60 = 24,000\n\nOh, that's nice because the X terms cancel out. So N * 60 equals 24,000.

So N is 400.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Because sometimes I might make a mistake in division. So 60 goes into 24,000 how many times? Well, 60 times 400 is 24,000, yes.

Since N is 400, X = 600,000 / 400. Let me compute that: 600,000 divided by 400. Well, 400 goes into 600 once with 200 left over. So 400 * 1500 = 600,000. Wait, no, wait: 400 * 1500 would be 600,000? Let me compute 400 * 1500. 400 * 1000 is 400,000, and 400 * 500 is 200,000. So 400,000 + 200,000 is 600,000. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, 400 times 1500 is 600,000. So X is 1500 rupees per employee.\n\nWait, that seems high, but maybe it's correct. So each employee contributes Rs. 1500. If each contributes 60 more, that's 1560.

So, if each employee contributes the same amount, the total would be 6 lakh. Then, the problem says that if each employee had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the total contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. The question is asking how many employees are in the organization.\n\nHmm. So, I think I can model this with some algebra. Let me think about what variables I need. Let's say the number of employees is N. And the original contribution each employee made is, let's say, C rupees.\n\nSo, from the first part, the total contribution is N multiplied by C, which equals 6 lakh. So that's equation one: N * C = 6,00,000.\n\nThen, in the second scenario, each employee contributes Rs. 60 more. So each contributes C + 60.

So, if each employee contributes the same amount, the total would be 6 lakh. Then, the problem says that if each employee had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the total contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. The question is asking how many employees are in the organization.\n\nHmm. So, I think I can model this with some algebra. Let me think about what variables I need. Let's say the number of employees is N. And the original contribution each employee made is, let's say, C rupees.\n\nSo, from the first part, the total contribution is N multiplied by C, which equals 6 lakh. So that's equation one: N * C = 6,00,000.\n\nThen, in the second scenario, each employee contributes Rs. 60 more. So each contributes C + 60. The total then becomes N*(C + 60) = 6,24,000.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1) N * C = 600,000\n2) N * (C + 60) = 624,000\n\nHmm, I can subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to find out the difference. Let's see:\n\nEquation 2 minus equation 1:\nN*(C + 60) - N*C = 624,000 - 600,000\nN*C + 60N - N*C = 24,000\n60N = 24,000\n\nOh, okay, so 60 multiplied by N equals 24,000. To find N, I can divide both sides by 60.\n\nSo N = 24,000 / 60. Let me calculate that. 24,000 divided by 60. Well, 60 times 400 is 24,000 because 60*400 is 24,000. So N is 400.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's plug N=400 back into the original equations to make sure.\n\nFirst equation: 400 * C = 600,000 \u2192 C = 600,000 / 400 = 1500. So each employee contributed 1500 rupees originally.\n\nIn the second scenario, each contributes 1500 + 60 = 1560. So 400 * 1560 = ?\n\nLet me calculate that. 400 * 1500 is 600,000. 400 * 60 is 24,000. So adding them gives 624,000, which matches the second condition. So that seems correct.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 400. So the answer should be C.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the number of employees in an organization based on their contributions. Let the number of employees be \\( N \\) and the original contribution per employee be \\( C \\). \n\nFrom the first condition, the total contribution is \\( N \\times C = 600,000 \\). From the second condition, if each employee contributes Rs. 60 extra, the total contribution becomes \\( N \\times (C + 60) = 624,000 \\).\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second gives:\n\\[\nN \\times (C + 60) - N \\times C = 624,000 - 600,000\n\\]\n\\[\n60N = 24,000\n\\]\n\\[\nN = \\frac{24,000}{60} = 400\n\\]\n\nVerifying, if \\( N = 400 \\), then \\( C = \\frac{600,000}{400} = 1500 \\). With an extra Rs. 60 per employee, the total contribution becomes \\( 400 \\times (1500 + 60) = 624,000 \\), which matches the second condition. Thus, the number of employees is 400.\n\nAnswer: C",
