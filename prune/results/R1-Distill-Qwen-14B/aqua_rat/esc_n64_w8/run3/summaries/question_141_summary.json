      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a sporting goods store that sells only yellow and white golf balls. Let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nSo the store starts with 600 golf balls. By the end of the day, they've sold 80% of their inventory. Hmm, wait, 80% of 600 is how much? Let me calculate that. 80% is 0.8, so 0.8 * 600 = 480. So they sold 480 golf balls in total.\n\nNow, the problem says they sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls. Oh, and they sold all of their white golf balls. So if the number of white balls sold is equal to the number of yellow balls sold, that means each color contributed half of the total sold. Wait, no, because they sold all the white ones. So let me think again.\n\nWait, the total sold is 480. And the number of white and yellow sold are equal. So if W is the number of white balls sold, and Y is the number of yellow balls sold, then W = Y. And W + Y = 480. So substituting, W + W = 480 \u2192 2W = 480 \u2192 W = 240. So they sold 240 white and 240 yellow, adding up to 480.\n\nBut wait, the store sold all of its white golf balls. So the initial stock of white balls must have been 240. Because they started with some white balls, and sold all of them. So initial white balls = 240.\n\nThe initial total stock was 600. So the initial yellow balls must be 600 minus the initial white balls. So 600 - 240 = 360. So the store had 360 yellow balls at the beginning.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix anything up. Let me recheck the numbers. Total sold is 480. Half are white, half are yellow, so 240 each. Since all white balls were sold, the initial white stock was 240. So initial yellow was 600 - 240 = 360. So the answer should be 360, which is option E.\n\nAlternatively, let me think if there's another way. Maybe I misread the part about selling 80% of the inventory. Wait, does it mean they sold 80% of each color? No, the problem says they sold 80% of the total inventory, not each color. So the total sold is 480, regardless of color.\n\nWait, but since they sold all the white balls, the initial white count must equal the number sold of white. And since the number sold of white and yellow are equal, the initial white count is 240. So initial yellow is 360. So the answer is E, 360.\n",

Wait, because they sold an equal number of each color. So if they sold, say, X white and X yellow, the total sold is 2X. Oh wait, but the total sold was 480, so 2X equals 480. So X is 240.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a sporting goods store and their golf balls. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nAlright, the store only sells yellow and white golf balls. At the start of the day, they had 600 golf balls in stock. By the end of the day, they sold 80% of their inventory. So that means they sold 80% of 600, and they have 20% left. Let me calculate that real quick.\n\n80% of 600 is 0.8 * 600. Let me see, 0.8 times 600 is 480. So they sold 480 golf balls in total, and 600 - 480 = 120 left. But wait, the problem doesn't specify how many are left, just that they sold 80%.\n\nNow, the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls. So the number of yellow balls sold equals the number of white balls sold. Also, importantly, in doing so, they sold all of their white golf balls. That means the white balls they had at the beginning must have been exactly equal to the number sold, which is half of the total sold because yellow and white are equal in number sold.\n\nWait, let's break that down. Let me think. They sold equal numbers of yellow and white. Let's say they sold Y yellow and W white. But the problem states that Y = W. Also, they sold all their white balls, which means the number of white balls they had at the beginning was exactly W.\n\nSo, the initial stock is 600, which is Y_initial + W_initial. And during the day, they sold Y_sold = W_sold = some number, let's call it x.\n\nWait, but since they sold all the white balls, W_initial = x. Because they started with W_initial white balls and sold all of them, so x = W_initial.\n\nSimilarly, the number of yellow balls sold is x, so Y_sold = x.\n\nNow, the total number of balls sold is Y_sold + W_sold = x + x = 2x. And earlier, we found that the total sold was 480. So 2x = 480 \u2192 x = 240. So each color sold 240.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the store sold 240 white and 240 yellow balls. So the initial white count was 240, because they sold all of them. And the initial yellow count would be the initial total minus initial white.\n\nWait, initial total is 600. So initial yellow is 600 - W_initial. W_initial is 240, so initial yellow is 600 - 240 = 360. So the answer would be 360, which is option E.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check that again. Because if they started with 360 yellow and 240 white, total is 600. Then they sold 240 yellow and 240 white. So after selling, the remaining would be 360 - 240 = 120 yellow and 240 - 240 = 0 white. So total left is 120, which matches the 20% of 600, which is 120. So that makes sense.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, E is 360, which is the initial number of yellow balls. So the correct answer is E.\n\nBut wait, another thought. Did I misinterpret anything? Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nThe store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls. So the number sold of each is equal. So if they sold 240 yellow and 240 white, that's correct. And since they sold all white balls, their initial white count was 240. So initial yellow was 600-240=360.\n\nYes, that all lines up. So the answer is E) 360.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe store initially had 600 golf balls, with an equal number of yellow and white balls sold during the day.

Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nAlright, the store only sells yellow and white golf balls. At the start of the day, they had 600 golf balls in stock. By the end of the day, they sold 80% of their inventory. So that means they sold 80% of 600, and they have 20% left. Let me calculate that real quick.\n\n80% of 600 is 0.8 * 600. Let me see, 0.8 times 600 is 480. So they sold 480 golf balls in total, and 600 - 480 = 120 left. But wait, the problem doesn't specify how many are left, just that they sold 80%.\n\nNow, the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls. So the number of yellow balls sold equals the number of white balls sold. Also, importantly, in doing so, they sold all of their white golf balls. That means the white balls they had at the beginning must have been exactly equal to the number sold, which is half of the total sold because yellow and white are equal in number sold.\n\nWait, let's break that down. Let me think. They sold equal numbers of yellow and white. Let's say they sold Y yellow and W white. But the problem states that Y = W. Also, they sold all their white balls, which means the number of white balls they had at the beginning was exactly W.\n\nSo, the initial stock is 600, which is Y_initial + W_initial. And during the day, they sold Y_sold = W_sold = some number, let's call it x.\n\nWait, but since they sold all the white balls, W_initial = x. Because they started with W_initial white balls and sold all of them, so x = W_initial.\n\nSimilarly, the number of yellow balls sold is x, so Y_sold = x.\n\nNow, the total number of balls sold is Y_sold + W_sold = x + x = 2x. And earlier, we found that the total sold was 480. So 2x = 480 \u2192 x = 240. So each color sold 240.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the store sold 240 white and 240 yellow balls. So the initial white count was 240, because they sold all of them. And the initial yellow count would be the initial total minus initial white.\n\nWait, initial total is 600. So initial yellow is 600 - W_initial. W_initial is 240, so initial yellow is 600 - 240 = 360. So the answer would be 360, which is option E.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check that again. Because if they started with 360 yellow and 240 white, total is 600. Then they sold 240 yellow and 240 white. So after selling, the remaining would be 360 - 240 = 120 yellow and 240 - 240 = 0 white. So total left is 120, which matches the 20% of 600, which is 120. So that makes sense.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, E is 360, which is the initial number of yellow balls. So the correct answer is E.\n\nBut wait, another thought. Did I misinterpret anything? Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nThe store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls. So the number sold of each is equal. So if they sold 240 yellow and 240 white, that's correct. And since they sold all white balls, their initial white count was 240. So initial yellow was 600-240=360.\n\nYes, that all lines up. So the answer is E) 360.\n\n\nThe store initially had 600 golf balls, with an equal number of yellow and white balls sold during the day. Since 80% of the inventory was sold, the total number of golf balls sold is:\n\n\\[\n0.8 \\times 600 = 480\n\\]\n\nThe store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, so let the number of yellow balls sold be \\( x \\) and the number of white balls sold also be \\( x \\). The total number of balls sold is:\n\n\\[\nx + x = 2x = 480 \\implies x = 240\n\\]\n\nThis means the store sold 240 yellow balls and 240 white balls. Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, the initial number of white golf balls was 240. The initial number of yellow golf balls is the total initial inventory minus the initial number of white golf balls:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Initial yellow balls} = 600 - 240 = 360\n\\]\n\nThus, the store had 360 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day.\n\nAnswer: E",

So they sold 480 golf balls in total.\n\nWait, and the problem says they sold an equal number of yellow and white balls. Oh, so half of the sold balls are yellow and half are white. Since they sold 480 in total, that means 240 yellow and 240 white were sold. Because 480 divided by 2 is 240 each.\n\nBut wait, the problem also says that in doing so, they sold all of their white golf balls. So that means the number of white balls they had at the beginning was exactly 240, because they sold all of them. Because they started with some white balls, sold all of them, which were 240.\n\nSo if the total initial stock was 600, and the white balls were 240, then the yellow balls must have been the rest.

They sold all white balls, which were 240, and half of the sold balls were yellow, so 240 yellow sold. So how many yellow did they have initially? Well, they had some yellow, sold 240, and had the rest left.\n\nWait, but wait, the problem doesn't say they sold all of the yellow balls. They only sold all of the white ones.

Therefore, the total number of golf balls sold is:\n\n\\[\nW + W = 2W = 480.\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( W \\):\n\n\\[\nW = \\frac{480}{2} = 240.\n\\]\n\nThis means the store initially had 240 white golf balls. Since the total initial inventory was 600 golf balls, the initial number of yellow golf balls is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Yellow balls} = 600 - 240 = 360.\n\\]\n\nThus, the store had 360 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day. The correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: E**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a sporting goods store that sells golf balls. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the store only has yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning, they had 600 in stock. By the end of the day, they sold 80% of their inventory. Oh, right, so 80% sold means they have 20% left, but maybe I don't need that part right now.\n\nWait, the question says that the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls. Oh, so the number of yellow balls sold equals the number of white balls sold. But wait, it also says that by selling those, they sold all of their white golf balls. Oh! So they sold all their white balls, and the same number of yellow balls. So whatever they had in white balls was completely sold, and the same number of yellows were sold.\n\nLet me try to break it down. Let's say the store had Y yellow balls and W white balls at the start. So Y + W = 600.\n\nThey sold 80% of their total stock. So total sold is 80% of 600. Let me calculate that: 0.8 * 600 = 480 golf balls sold in total.\n\nSince they sold equal numbers of yellow and white, and all white balls were sold. So the number of white balls they had initially is equal to the number sold, which is half of the total sold. Because if yellow and white each contributed half of the total sold. So W = (480)/2 = 240. Because for every white ball sold, a yellow one was sold, so the total is 240 white + 240 yellow sold, which adds up to 480.\n\nWait, so W is 240. Because they sold all their white balls, which were 240. So the initial number of white balls was 240. Then the initial number of yellow balls must have been Y = 600 - W = 600 - 240 = 360.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check. Because the store sold 80% of the total, which is 480. And since they sold the same number of yellow and white, and all white were sold. So the number of white balls was equal to the number of white sold, which is half of 480. So yes, W=240, Y=360.\n\nSo the question is asking how many yellow golf balls the store had to begin with. So that would be 360. Looking at the options, E is 360. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So initial total is 600. They sold 80% of 600, which is 480. Those 480 are split equally between yellow and white, so 240 each. So white balls in stock were 240, so they all sold. So the initial white was 240, so initial yellow was 600-240=360. That makes sense. So the answer is E) 360.\n",
