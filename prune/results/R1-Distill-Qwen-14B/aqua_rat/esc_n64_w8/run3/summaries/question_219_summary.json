      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about averages and percentages. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, let's see what the question says.\n\nSo, the passing students had an average of 83, and the failing ones had an average of 55. The overall class average was 76. I need to find what percent of the class passed. The options are given, but I'll try to figure it out without guessing.\n\nWait, I remember something about weighted averages. Since the overall average is between 83 and 55, the percentage of passers and failers will determine where that 76 falls. So, I think I should set up an equation where the total points from passers and failers contribute to the overall average.\n\nLet me denote the percentage of passers as p, and the percentage of failers as (100-p), but maybe it's easier to use fractions. Alternatively, I can assume a certain number of students to make the calculation easier. Oh, maybe using variables for the number of students in each group.\n\nLet's say the number of passing students is x, and the number of failing students is y. The total number of students is x + y.\n\nThe total marks for passers would be 83x, and for failers 55y. The overall average is (83x + 55y)/(x + y) = 76.\n\nSo I can set up the equation: 83x + 55y = 76(x + y).\n\nLet me expand that: 83x +55y =76x +76y.\n\nHmm, subtract 76x and 55y from both sides to get:\n\n83x -76x =76y -55y\n7x =21y\n\nOh, so 7x =21y. Simplifying, x = 3y. That means the number of passers is three times the number of failers.\n\nWait, so the ratio of passers to failers is 3:1. Because x is 3y, so for every 1 failing student, there are 3 passing.\n\nBut the question asks for the percentage of the class that passed. So the class is made up of x + y students, which is 3y + y =4y.\n\nThe percentage of passers is (x / (x + y)) *100. Substituting x=3y, it's (3y)/(4y) *100. The y's cancel out, so 3/4 is 75%. Wait, but 3/4 is 75%, which would be option E.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Wait, if the ratio is 3:1, then in a class of 4, 3 passed and 1 failed. So the percentage passed is 75%, which is option E. But let me check the options again.\n\nThe options are A)44%, B)66%, C)68%, D)72%, E)75%. So E is an option.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me go through the calculations again.\n\nThe equation: 83x +55y =76(x + y)\n\n83x +55y =76x +76y\n\nSubtract 76x and 55y:\n\n83x -76x =76y -55y \u21927x=21y \u2192 x=3y.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the ratio is 3:1. So the percentage is 3/(3+1) = 3/4 =75% passed.\n\nWait, but wait a second. I thought the overall average being closer to 55 would mean more failers, but 75% passed and only 25% failed. Let me think: 75% passed with 83 and 25% failed with 55.\n\nLet me compute the overall average again to verify.\n\nSo, if 75% passed and 25% failed:\n\nOverall average = (0.75 *83) + (0.25 *55) \n\nCalculating:\n\n0.75 *83 = 62.25\n\n0.25 *55 =13.75\n\nTotal average =62.25 +13.75=76. Which matches the given average. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 75% as the correct answer? Let me check the options again.\n\nWait, the options are A)44%, B)66%, C)68%, D)72%, E)75%.\n\nSo E is 75%, which is what I calculated. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes the way the problem is set up could be different. Did I make any wrong assumptions?\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe using alligation.\n\nThe difference between passing average (83) and overall (76) is 7. The difference between overall (76) and failing average (55) is 21.\n\nWait, the ratio would be inversely proportional. So the ratio of failers to passers is 7:21, which simplifies to 1:3. So the ratio is 1:3, meaning for every 1 failure, there are 3 passes. So the percentage of passers is 3/(3+1) *100=75%, same as before. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but I thought the answer was 75%, which is option E. So the correct answer should be E.\n\nBut wait, the options given are A-E with E being 75%. So the answer is E.\n\nWait, but the original question says \"what percent of the class passed?\" So if 75% passed, that's option E. But I thought earlier that the correct answer is 75%, but I have a feeling I might have missed something because sometimes the way the question is worded can trip me up. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's say the number of students is 100. Suppose p% passed and (100-p)% failed.\n\nThe total points would be 83*p +55*(100-p) =76*100.\n\nSo 83p +55(100 -p) =7600\n\nExpanding: 83p +5500 -55p =7600\n\nCombine terms: (83p -55p) +5500=7600 \u2192 28p +5500=7600 \u219228p=2100 \u2192p=2100/28=75.\n\nSo p=75%, so the answer is E. That's correct.\n",

Let's see what the problem says.\n\nThe question is about test scores. Passing students have an average of 83, failing students have an average of 55. The overall class average is 76. I need to find what percent of the class passed. The options are A to E, with some percentages given.\n\nHmm, I remember that when dealing with averages, especially weighted averages, you can think in terms of the ratio of students in each group. So, let's say the number of passing students is P and the number of failing students is F. The total class is P + F.\n\nThe total sum of all the scores would be (83 * P) + (55 * F). The overall average is the total sum divided by the total number of students, which is (83P +55F)/(P+F) = 76.\n\nSo I can set up that equation: (83P +55F)/(P + F) =76.\n\nI think I can rearrange this equation to find the ratio of P to F. Let me multiply both sides by (P + F) to get rid of the denominator:\n\n83P +55F =76(P + F).\n\nExpanding the right side: 76P +76F.\n\nNow, subtract 76P and 76F from both sides to bring like terms together:\n\n83P -76P +55F -76F =0.\n\nWhich simplifies to 7P -21F =0.\n\nWait, 83P minus 76P is 7P, and 55F minus76F is -21F. So equation becomes 7P =21F.\n\nDivide both sides by 7: P =3F.\n\nOh, so the number of passing students is three times the number of failing students. That means for every failing student, there are three passing ones. So the ratio of P to F is 3:1.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the percentage of the class that passed. So the total number of students is P + F. Since P=3F, total is 3F + F =4F.\n\nSo the fraction that passed is P/(P + F) =3F/(4F) =3/4 =0.75. Wait, 0.75 is 75%.

Using the formula for the average:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{83P + 55F}{P + F} = 76\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\( P + F \\) to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n83P + 55F = 76(P + F)\n\\]\n\nExpanding the right-hand side:\n\n\\[\n83P + 55F = 76P + 76F\n\\]\n\nRearranging terms to group like terms together:\n\n\\[\n83P - 76P = 76F - 55F\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n7P = 21F\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 7:\n\n\\[\nP = 3F\n\\]\n\nThis means the ratio of passing students to failing students is \\( P:F = 3:1 \\). The total number of students is \\( P + F = 3F + F = 4F \\). The fraction of the class that passed is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{P}{P + F} = \\frac{3F}{4F} = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75\n\\]\n\nConverting this to a percentage:\n\n\\[\n0.75 \\times 100 = 75\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, 75% of the class passed. Verifying with an example, if there are 4 students in total (3 passers and 1 failer), the total score is \\( 3 \\times 83 + 1 \\times 55 = 304 \\), and the average is \\( 304 / 4 = 76 \\), which matches the given average. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: E",

The options are A) 44%, B) 66%, C) 68%, D)72%, E)75%.\n\nAlright, I remember that averages can be tricky because they depend on the number of students in each group. So, the idea is probably to set up some kind of weighted average equation.

The overall class average is 76. I need to find what percent of the class passed.\n\nWait, so I remember that averages can be combined using weighted averages. So, the overall average is somewhere between 55 and 83. Since 76 is closer to 55 than to 83, that suggests that there might be more failing students than passing ones. Or maybe not? Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. Wait, the overall average is 76. Let me see: 76 is 21 points above 55 and 7 points below 83. Hmm, that might relate to the weights.\n\nSo, perhaps I can set this up as a weighted average problem. Let me denote the proportion of passing students as p, and failing as f. Since it's a class, p + f = 1, right? Because all students are either passing or failing.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the percentage, so I can let p be the fraction (or percentage) of students who passed, and (1 - p) be those who failed.\n\nThe overall average is then the weighted sum of the two averages.

Let me think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, let's read the problem again. The passing students averaged 83, the failing ones averaged 55. The overall class average was 76. I need to find the percentage that passed.\n\nHmm, I remember that average is total points divided by the number of students. So maybe I can set up some equations here.\n\nLet's say the number of passing students is P and the number of failing students is F. So the total number of students is P + F.\n\nThe total points for the passers would be 83 * P, and for the failers, it's 55 * F. The overall average is 76, which would be the total points divided by total students. So the equation is (83P + 55F) / (P + F) = 76.\n\nI can rearrange this equation to solve for the ratio of P to F. Let's do that.\n\nMultiply both sides by (P + F):\n83P + 55F = 76(P + F)\n\nExpanding the right side:\n83P + 55F = 76P + 76F\n\nNow, let's get all the P terms on one side and F on the other. Subtract 76P from both sides:\n83P - 76P +55F = 76F\nWhich is 7P +55F =76F.\n\nThen subtract 55F from both sides:\n7P = 21F.\n\nWait, 76F minus 55F is 21F. So 7P =21F. That simplifies to P =3F.\n\nSo the ratio of P to F is 3:1. Because if P is 3F, then F is P/3. So for every 3 passers, there's 1 failure.\n\nSo the total number of students is P + F =3F + F=4F. So the fraction of students who passed is P/(P+F)=3F/(4F)=3/4, which is 75%. Oh wait, but looking at the options, E is 75%? Let me check the options again.\n\nWait, the options are A)44%, B)66%, C)68%, D)72%, E)75%. So E is 75%, which would mean 75% passed. But wait, that seems high because the overall average is 76, which is closer to 55 than 83. So maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let's double-check the calculations. Let me go through the algebra again.\n\nWe had 83P +55F =76(P + F)\n\nExpanding the right side: 76P +76F.\n\nSubtract 76P and 55F from both sides:\n83P -76P =76F -55F\n7P =21F\nDivide both sides by 7:\nP =3F.\n\nSo yes, P is 3 times F. So the ratio is 3:1. So the total is 4 parts, 3 passed, 1 failed. So 3/4 is 75%.\n\nBut wait, the overall average is 76, which is closer to 55, so maybe more students failed than passed? Hmm, but according to the calculation, more passed. That seems conflicting.\n\nWait, let's think about it another way. Suppose there are more failing students. Their average is lower, so if more failed, the overall average would be lower. So if the overall is 76, which is closer to 55 (the fail average) than 83, that suggests more students failed, right?\n\nWait, but according to my calculation, the ratio is 3:1 in favor of passers. So that would mean 75% passed, which would make the average closer to 83, but the given average is 76, which is closer to 55. So that's conflicting. So perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra.\n\nWait, let me recheck the steps.\n\n83P +55F =76(P + F)\n\nExpanding: 83P +55F =76P +76F\n\nSubtract 76P and 55F:\n\n83P -76P = 76F -55F\n\n7P =21F\n\nSo 7P =21F \u2192 P=3F.\n\nSo P is three times F. So for every 1 failing student, there are 3 passing. So 3/4 of the class passed, which is 75%. But that would make the average closer to 83 than to 55. Because 75% is a lot of passers.\n\nWait, maybe I should plug in some numbers. Let's say F=100 students. Then P=300. So total students is 400.\n\nTotal points for passers: 300 *83 =24,900.\n\nFailing students:100 *55=5,500.\n\nTotal points:24,900 +5,500=30,400.\n\nAverage: 30,400 /400=76. Exactly as given. So the calculation is correct. So 300/400 is 75%. So the answer should be E)75%.\n\nWait, but then why does the average sit closer to the failing average? Because 75% passed, 25% failed. So 3/4 of the students are high scorers, so their average would pull the overall average higher.\n\nWait, but 83 is much higher than 76. Let me see: the difference between 83 and 76 is 7 points. The difference between 76 and 55 is 21 points. So perhaps the ratio is based on the inverses of these differences.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's use the concept of weighted averages. The distance between the two group averages and the overall average.\n\nThe average of the passers is 83, and the failing is 55. The overall is 76.\n\nThe distance from passing average to overall: 83-76=7.\n\nThe distance from failing average to overall:76-55=21.\n\nSo the ratio of failing to passing students is 7:21, which simplifies to 1:3. So the number of failing students is 1 part, and passing is 3 parts. So total is 4 parts, 3 passed, 1 failed. So 75% passed.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the distance from the lower group (fail) is larger, so there are more students in the higher group (pass) to bring the average up.\n\nWait, yes, so the ratio is inverse to the distances. So the ratio of F:P is 7:21 \u2192 1:3. So 25% failed, 75% passed.\n\nSo the answer is E)75%.\n",

Let me think through this step by step. \n\nAlright, the problem says that passing students averaged 83, and failing students averaged 55. The overall class average was 76. I need to find what percent of the class passed. \n\nWait, how do I approach this? I remember something about weighted averages. Like, the overall average is somewhere between the two group averages, weighted by the number of students in each group. So, maybe I can set up an equation where the total points from passers and the total from non-passers add up to the overall average.\n\nLet me denote the percentage of passers as p, and the percentage of failers as (1-p), assuming p is a fraction, like 0.6 for 60%. But wait, the options are in percentages, so maybe I'll just keep it as p for the time being.\n\nSo, the total average can be thought of as the sum of the average of passers multiplied by their proportion plus the average of failers multiplied by their proportion. So, the equation would be:\n\n83 * p + 55 * (1 - p) = 76\n\nLet me check that. Because if p is the proportion of passers, then 1-p is the proportion of failers. Multiplying each group's average by their proportion gives their contribution to the total average. Adding them gives the overall average. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, let's solve for p. \n\n83p + 55(1 - p) = 76\n\nExpanding that, 83p +55 -55p =76.\n\nCombine like terms: (83p -55p) = 28p. So,\n\n28p +55 =76\n\nSubtract 55 from both sides: 28p = 76 -55 =21\n\nSo, 28p =21 \u2192 p =21/28 = 3/4 =0.75.\n\nWait, so p is 0.75, which is 75%. So, 75% of the class passed. Looking at the options, E is 75%. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again. So, the overall average is 76. The passers are higher than that, so the failers must be pulling it down. So, the number of passers should be less than the number of failers if the average is closer to 55 than 83. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 76 is closer to 83 than to 55. Let me see: 83 -76 is 7, and 76-55 is 21. So, the average is closer to 55 than to 83. Wait, that can't be right because 76 is closer to 83 by 7 points, but 21 points away from 55. Oh wait, no, 76 is 76-55=21 above 55, and 83-76=7 below 83. So, the average is closer to 55, which would imply that more students failed than passed. But according to the calculation, p is 75% passed. That can't be right because if more passed, the average should be closer to 83. Wait, that contradicts.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the setup. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me reevaluate. Because 76 is closer to 55 than to 83. So, that suggests that more students are failing, meaning that the proportion of passers is less than 50%. But according to my calculation, p is 75%, which is a majority. That doesn't make sense. So, perhaps I set up the equation incorrectly.\n\nWait, maybe I got the equation backwards. Let me think again. Let me denote p as the fraction of passers, so (1-p) is the fraction of failers. The total average is the sum of each group's average times their fraction.\n\nSo, 83p +55(1-p) =76.\n\nWait, plugging p=0.75 into this: 83*(0.75)=62.25, 55*(0.25)=13.75. Sum is 62.25+13.75=76. That works. So mathematically, it's correct. But then why does it seem like the average is closer to 55?\n\nAh, because 0.75 is more than half, so more passers would pull the average closer to 83. But in this case, the average is 76, which is closer to 55 than to 83. So, that suggests that my calculation must be wrong.\n\nWait, wait. 76 is 21 units above 55 and 7 units below 83. So the distance from 55 is larger than the distance from 83. So the average is closer to 55, which would imply that more students are failing, so the proportion of passers is less than 50%. But according to the math, p=75% is the solution. That's a contradiction. So where did I go wrong?\n\nHmm. Let me re-examine the equation. Oh wait, wait. No, wait: 76 is closer to 55. So, if the average is closer to 55, then the majority must be failing. So the proportion of passers should be less than 50%, right? But according to my solution, p=75% which is 75% passers, which would make the average closer to 83. So this suggests that my equation setup is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I inverted the equation. Maybe I should have the failing average multiplied by p and passing average multiplied by (1-p). Let me try that.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Let me think of it as, the overall average is the weighted average of the two groups. So, if more students are failing, their average would have a larger weight. So, the equation should have the failing average multiplied by (1-p) and the passing by p.\n\nWait, no, no. If p is the proportion of passers, then 1-p is the proportion of failers. So the equation is correct as before.\n\nWait, but according to the equation, p=75% leads to the correct average. But according to the average's position, that would imply that the majority are passers, which would make the average closer to 83. But in this case, the average is 76, which is closer to 55 than 83. So, there's a contradiction here.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.\n\nSo the equation is 83p +55(1-p) =76.\n\nExpanding: 83p +55 -55p =76.\n\nSo, 83p-55p =28p. 28p +55=76.\n\n28p=76-55=21.\n\np=21/28=3/4=0.75, which is 75%. So that's correct.\n\nBut that contradicts with the intuition that the average is closer to 55. So, perhaps my intuition was wrong. Let me do the math again. Let's see, 83 and 55. The difference between them is 28 points.\n\nThe overall average is 76. So, how far is 76 from each? 76-55=21, and 83-76=7.\n\nSo, the distance from 55 is 21, and from 83 is 7. So, the ratio of distances is 3:1 (21/7=3). So, the weights should be in the inverse ratio. So, the proportion of passers is 1/(1+3)=25%, and the proportion of failers is 3/(4)=75%.\n\nWait, wait, that's opposite to what I calculated earlier. So, perhaps the proportion of passers is 25%? That would explain why the average is closer to 55. So, where did I go wrong in my initial setup?\n\nAh, I think I see the mistake. The weighted average formula should have the proportion of passers multiplied by their average plus the proportion of failers multiplied by their average. So, perhaps I confused which proportion is which.\n\nWait, no, the initial equation was correct. So, why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the ratio of the number of students. Let me think about it differently. Let's let the number of passers be x, and the number of failers be y. The total number is x + y.\n\nThe total points from passers is 83x, and from failers is 55y. The overall average is (83x +55y)/(x + y) =76.\n\nSo, 83x +55y =76(x + y) \u2192 83x +55y=76x +76y \u2192 83x -76x =76y -55y \u21927x=21y \u2192 x/y=21/7=3. So, x/y=3/1 \u2192 x=3y.\n\nSo, the number of passers is 3 times the number of failers. So, the proportion of passers is x/(x + y) = 3y/(3y + y)=3y/4y=3/4=75%. So, that's 75% passers.\n\nBut that brings us back to the same conclusion as before. So, why is the average closer to 55 if the majority are passers? Wait, perhaps the way I'm perceiving the average's position is wrong. Let me think numerically. \n\nIf 75% of the students passed with 83, and 25% failed with 55, what's the average? Let's say 3 students passed and 1 failed. \n\nTotal points: 3*83=249, 1*55=55. Sum=249+55=304. Total students=4. Average=304/4=76. Exactly as given.\n\nBut the average is 76, which is 76-55=21 above 55, and 83-76=7 below 83. So, the average is closer to 55. But the majority are passers. So, that's possible because the passers' average is much higher, but the failers' average is much lower, so the difference in averages compensates for the numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps it's because the passers' average is much higher. Let me think: The distance between 83 and 55 is 28 points. The average is 76, which is 21 above 55 and 7 below 83. So, the ratio is 3:1. So, the number of failers should be 3 times the number of passers. Wait, that can't be right because when I set x=3y, the passers are 3y, which is more than the failers. Wait, no. If x=3y, then x is 3 times y, so the number of passers is three times the number of failers. So, failers are 25%, passers 75%.\n\nWait, but according to the ratio I just thought, the distance is 3:1, so the proportion should be in the inverse ratio. So, the proportion of failers is 3/(3+1) =75%, and passers is 25%. But according to the math, it's the opposite. So, perhaps I'm getting the ratio reversed.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is the other way around. Let me think again. The ratio of distances is 21:7=3:1. So, the weights should be in the ratio of 1:3. So, the proportion of passers is 1/(1+3)=25%, and failers is 75%. But according to the equation, the proportion of passers is 75%. So, that suggests that perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, no. Let's go back to the equation. From the equation, x=3y. So, the number of passers is 3y, and the number of failers is y. So, the ratio is 3:1 (passers to failers). So, passers are 3 parts, failers 1 part. So, the proportion of passers is 3/(3+1)=75%, which matches the earlier result.\n\nSo, how does that reconcile with the average being closer to 55? Because the number of failers is smaller, but their average is much lower. So, perhaps the effect is that even with fewer failers, their lower average pulls the overall average towards 55.\n\nWait, but in the example I did earlier, with 3 passers and 1 failer, the average is 76. So, 76 is closer to 55 (21 away) than to 83 (7 away). So, the majority are passers, but the average is closer to the failing average. That's because the failing average is much lower, so even a small number of failers can pull the average more than a larger number of passers. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is how much each group contributes. Let me think about the weighted average. The distance from 55 to 76 is 21, and from 76 to 83 is 7. So, the ratio is 21:7=3:1. So, the weight for 55 is 1, and for 83 is 3. Or wait, no, in weighted averages, the weights are inversely proportional to the distances. So, the weight for 55 is 3, and for 83 is 1. So, the proportion of passers is 1/(3+1)=25%, and failers 75%. But that's conflicting with the math.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach. Let's think of the difference between the two group averages and the overall average.\n\nThe passing group is 83, which is 7 above the overall average of 76. The failing group is 55, which is 21 below the overall average.\n\nIn such cases, the ratio of the sizes of the groups is inversely proportional to these differences. So, the ratio of passers to failers is 21:7, which simplifies to 3:1. So, for every 3 passers, there is 1 failer. So, the proportion of passers is 3/(3+1)=75%, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, that makes sense. Because the failing group is farther from the overall average, their proportion is larger. Wait, no. Wait, the ratio is inversely proportional. So, the group that's further away has a smaller proportion. Wait, no, wait. If the passing group is closer to the overall average (only 7 points away), and the failing group is further (21 points away), then the passing group would have a larger proportion because their average is closer. \n\nWait, I'm getting myself mixed up. Let me think: the group that contributes more to the average being where it is will have a larger proportion. So, if the passing group's average is closer to the overall average, they must have a larger proportion. So, in this case, since 76 is closer to 83 than to 55, the passers must be a larger proportion. Which is what the math says: 75% passers.\n\nSo, the confusion was because I thought the average being closer to 55 would imply more failers, but that's not the case. The average being closer to the passing average (83) implies more passers. So, the initial calculation was correct, and the answer is 75%, which is option E.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, E is 75%. So that's the correct answer.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the concept of weighted averages.

However, this does not imply that more students failed. Instead, the weighted average reflects the fact that the failing students' average is much lower, pulling the overall average closer to 55 despite fewer failing students.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: E**",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about averages and figuring out what percentage of the class passed. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step. \n\nAlright, the problem says that passing students averaged 83, and failing students averaged 55. The overall class average was 76. I need to find what percent of the class passed. \n\nWait, how do I approach this? I remember something about weighted averages. Like, the overall average is somewhere between the two group averages, weighted by the number of students in each group. So, maybe I can set up an equation where the total points from passers and the total from non-passers add up to the overall average.\n\nLet me denote the percentage of passers as p, and the percentage of failers as (1-p), assuming p is a fraction, like 0.6 for 60%. But wait, the options are in percentages, so maybe I'll just keep it as p for the time being.\n\nSo, the total average can be thought of as the sum of the average of passers multiplied by their proportion plus the average of failers multiplied by their proportion. So, the equation would be:\n\n83 * p + 55 * (1 - p) = 76\n\nLet me check that. Because if p is the proportion of passers, then 1-p is the proportion of failers. Multiplying each group's average by their proportion gives their contribution to the total average. Adding them gives the overall average. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, let's solve for p. \n\n83p + 55(1 - p) = 76\n\nExpanding that, 83p +55 -55p =76.\n\nCombine like terms: (83p -55p) = 28p. So,\n\n28p +55 =76\n\nSubtract 55 from both sides: 28p = 76 -55 =21\n\nSo, 28p =21 \u2192 p =21/28 = 3/4 =0.75.\n\nWait, so p is 0.75, which is 75%. So, 75% of the class passed. Looking at the options, E is 75%. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again. So, the overall average is 76. The passers are higher than that, so the failers must be pulling it down. So, the number of passers should be less than the number of failers if the average is closer to 55 than 83. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 76 is closer to 83 than to 55. Let me see: 83 -76 is 7, and 76-55 is 21. So, the average is closer to 55 than to 83. Wait, that can't be right because 76 is closer to 83 by 7 points, but 21 points away from 55. Oh wait, no, 76 is 76-55=21 above 55, and 83-76=7 below 83. So, the average is closer to 55, which would imply that more students failed than passed. But according to the calculation, p is 75% passed. That can't be right because if more passed, the average should be closer to 83. Wait, that contradicts.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the setup. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me reevaluate. Because 76 is closer to 55 than to 83. So, that suggests that more students are failing, meaning that the proportion of passers is less than 50%.

So, the proportion of passers is 1/(1+3)=25%, and the proportion of failers is 3/(4)=75%.\n\nWait, wait, that's opposite to what I calculated earlier. So, perhaps the proportion of passers is 25%? That would explain why the average is closer to 55. So, where did I go wrong in my initial setup?\n\nAh, I think I see the mistake. The weighted average formula should have the proportion of passers multiplied by their average plus the proportion of failers multiplied by their average.

So, x/y=3/1 \u2192 x=3y.\n\nSo, the number of passers is 3 times the number of failers. So, the proportion of passers is x/(x + y) = 3y/(3y + y)=3y/4y=3/4=75%. So, that's 75% passers.\n\nBut that brings us back to the same conclusion as before. So, why is the average closer to 55 if the majority are passers? Wait, perhaps the way I'm perceiving the average's position is wrong. Let me think numerically. \n\nIf 75% of the students passed with 83, and 25% failed with 55, what's the average?

If x=3y, then x is 3 times y, so the number of passers is three times the number of failers. So, failers are 25%, passers 75%.\n\nWait, but according to the ratio I just thought, the distance is 3:1, so the proportion should be in the inverse ratio. So, the proportion of failers is 3/(3+1) =75%, and passers is 25%. But according to the math, it's the opposite. So, perhaps I'm getting the ratio reversed.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is the other way around. Let me think again. The ratio of distances is 21:7=3:1. So, the weights should be in the ratio of 1:3. So, the proportion of passers is 1/(1+3)=25%, and failers is 75%. But according to the equation, the proportion of passers is 75%. So, that suggests that perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, no.

Let me think about the weighted average. The distance from 55 to 76 is 21, and from 76 to 83 is 7. So, the ratio is 21:7=3:1. So, the weight for 55 is 1, and for 83 is 3. Or wait, no, in weighted averages, the weights are inversely proportional to the distances. So, the weight for 55 is 3, and for 83 is 1. So, the proportion of passers is 1/(3+1)=25%, and failers 75%. But that's conflicting with the math.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach. Let's think of the difference between the two group averages and the overall average.\n\nThe passing group is 83, which is 7 above the overall average of 76. The failing group is 55, which is 21 below the overall average.\n\nIn such cases, the ratio of the sizes of the groups is inversely proportional to these differences.

Because the failing group is farther from the overall average, their proportion is larger. Wait, no. Wait, the ratio is inversely proportional. So, the group that's further away has a smaller proportion. Wait, no, wait. If the passing group is closer to the overall average (only 7 points away), and the failing group is further (21 points away), then the passing group would have a larger proportion because their average is closer. \n\nWait, I'm getting myself mixed up. Let me think: the group that contributes more to the average being where it is will have a larger proportion.

The average being closer to the passing average (83) implies more passers. So, the initial calculation was correct, and the answer is 75%, which is option E.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, E is 75%. So that's the correct answer.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the concept of weighted averages. Let \\( p \\) represent the proportion of students who passed, and \\( 1-p \\) represent the proportion of students who failed. The overall class average is given as 76, which is a weighted average of the passing and failing students' averages:\n\n\\[\n83p + 55(1-p) = 76\n\\]\n\nExpanding and simplifying the equation:\n\n\\[\n83p + 55 - 55p = 76\n\\]\n\n\\[\n28p + 55 = 76\n\\]\n\n\\[\n28p = 76 - 55\n\\]\n\n\\[\n28p = 21\n\\]\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{21}{28} = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( p = 0.75 \\), meaning 75% of the class passed.\n\nTo verify, consider the total points contributed by passers and failers. If 75% of the students passed, their total contribution would be \\( 83 \\times 0.75 = 62.25 \\), and the remaining 25% of students who failed would contribute \\( 55 \\times 0.25 = 13.75 \\). Adding these gives:\n\n\\[\n62.25 + 13.75 = 76\n\\]\n\nThis matches the overall class average of 76, confirming the calculation is correct.\n\nThe confusion arises because the average of 76 is closer to 55 (the failing average) than to 83 (the passing average). However, this does not imply that more students failed. Instead, the weighted average reflects the fact that the failing students' average is much lower, pulling the overall average closer to 55 despite fewer failing students.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: E**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about averages and passing percentages. Let me see if I can figure it out step by step.\n\nHmm, the problem says that passing students had an average of 83, and failing students had an average of 55. The overall class average was 76. I need to find what percent of the class passed.\n\nWait, right. So, averages. I remember that averages are total points divided by the number of students. So maybe I can use that to set up some equations.\n\nLet me denote the number of passing students as P and the number of failing students as F. Then the total number of students is P + F.\n\nThe total points for passing students would be 83 * P, and for failing students it's 55 * F. The overall average is 76, so the total points for the whole class would be 76 * (P + F).\n\nPutting that into an equation: 83P + 55F = 76(P + F). That makes sense because the sum of passing and failing points equals the total points based on the overall average.\n\nLet me expand the right side: 76P + 76F. So subtract that from both sides or rearrange terms.\n\n83P + 55F = 76P +76F\n\nSubtract 76P and 55F from both sides:\n\n83P -76P = 76F -55F\n\nSo 7P = 21F.\n\nSimplify that: 7P =21F. Dividing both sides by 7 gives P =3F.\n\nWait, so the number of passing students is three times the number of failing students? So P is three times F.\n\nBut I need the percentage of the class that passed. So the total class is P + F. Since P is 3F, the total is 3F + F =4F.\n\nSo the percentage of passers is (P / total) *100. Which is (3F /4F)*100. The F cancels out, so (3/4)*100 = 75%.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 75%. So that's the answer. But wait, let me double-check my math because sometimes I might make a mistake.\n\nWait, 83P +55F =76(P + F). Let me plug in P=3F and see if it works.\n\n83*(3F) +55F =76*(3F + F) \u2192 249F +55F =76*(4F) \u2192 304F =304F. Yep, that works. So the percentage is 75%.\n\nBut wait, the options include 75% as E. So the answer should be E. But wait, looking back at the options, the choices are A)44%, B)66%, C)68%, D)72%, E)75%. So E is correct.\n",
