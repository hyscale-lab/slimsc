      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about exam scores and averages. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe average of the highest and lowest scores is x. The overall class average is y, and there are z students. I need to find the average when we exclude the highest and lowest scorers.\n\nWait, so the question is asking for the average of all the students except the top and bottom scorers. Right. So, I should think about how averages work.\n\nI remember that average is total divided by the number of items. So, the total sum of all the scores is average multiplied by the number of students. So for the entire class, the total sum is y multiplied by z, which is y*z.\n\nNow, the average of the highest and lowest is x. So, (highest + lowest)/2 = x. That means the sum of the highest and lowest is 2x. So, highest + lowest = 2x.\n\nSo, if I subtract those two scores from the total sum, I get the sum of the remaining students' scores. That would be y*z - (highest + lowest) = y*z - 2x.\n\nHow many students are left after removing the highest and lowest? Well, originally there are z students, so after removing two, there are z-2 students left. So, the average of these remaining students would be (sum of their scores) divided by (z-2). \n\nSo, putting that together, the average is (y*z - 2x) divided by (z-2). Let me write that as a formula: (zy - 2x)/(z-2).\n\nLooking at the options, option D is (zy - 2x)/(z-2), which matches what I derived. So the answer should be D.\n",

Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nThe question says that the average of the highest and lowest scores is x. So, if I think about it, the average of two numbers is their sum divided by two. That means the sum of the highest and lowest scores must be 2x. Let me write that down: highest + lowest = 2x.\n\nThen, the average score for the entire class is y.

The new number of students will be z - 2. The new average will be the total sum minus the highest and lowest scores, divided by (z - 2).\n\nWait, so the new total would be (y*z) minus (highest + lowest). Since highest + lowest is 2x, the new total is y*z - 2x. Then, the average is (y*z - 2x) divided by (z-2). So that's (zy - 2x)/(z-2).\n\nLooking at the options, option D is (zy - 2x)/(z-2).

Therefore, the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average (excluding H and L)} = \\frac{y \\cdot z - 2x}{z - 2}\n\\]\n\nNow, comparing this result with the options:\n\n- **Option A:** \\(\\frac{zy - 2x}{z}\\) is incorrect because it divides by the original number of students \\( z \\), not \\( z - 2 \\).\n- **Option B:** \\(\\frac{zy - 2}{z}\\) is incorrect because it does not include \\( x \\) in the numerator.\n- **Option C:** \\(\\frac{zx - y}{z - 2}\\) is incorrect because the numerator does not match the derived expression.\n- **Option D:** \\(\\frac{zy - 2x}{z - 2}\\) matches the derived expression and is correct.\n- **Option E:** \\(\\frac{zy - x}{z + 2}\\) is incorrect because the denominator is \\( z + 2 \\), not \\( z - 2 \\).\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: D**",

Hmm, let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says that the average of the highest and lowest score is equal to x. The overall average for the entire class is y, and there are z students in the class, with z being greater than 5. I need to find the average score when we exclude the highest and lowest scorers, and express it in terms of x, y, and z.\n\nAlright, let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that the average is the sum of all the scores divided by the number of students. So, for the entire class, the average y would be equal to the total sum of all scores divided by z. That means the total sum of all scores is y multiplied by z. Let me write that as Total = y * z.\n\nNext, the average of the highest and lowest score is x. So, if I let H be the highest score and L be the lowest, then (H + L)/2 = x. Which means H + L equals 2x. So H + L = 2x.\n\nNow, the question is about the average when we exclude the highest and lowest. So the number of students we're considering now is z minus 2, because we're taking out two people. The sum of the remaining students' scores would be the total sum minus H and minus L. So sum_excluding = Total - H - L.\n\nSubstituting what I have: sum_excluding = (y*z) - (H + L). But since H + L is 2x, this becomes sum_excluding = y*z - 2x.\n\nSo the average for these z-2 students would be sum_excluding divided by (z-2). So average = (y*z - 2x)/(z-2). \n\nLooking at the options, I see option D is (zy \u2013 2x)/(z -2), which matches what I derived. Let me quickly check the other options to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nOption A is (zy \u2013 2x)/z. That would be if we subtracted the sum of H and L and divided by the original z, which isn't the case here. We're excluding two students, so the denominator is z-2, so A is not right.\n\nOption B is (zy \u20132)/z. That seems off because it's subtracting 2, not 2x. So probably not correct.\n\nOption C is (zx \u2013 y)/(z\u20132). That would imply some rearrangement, but I don't think it's the right numerator. My numerator is yz -2x, which isn't the same as zx - y.\n\nOption E is (zy \u2013x)/(z +2).

Which would be (zy - 2x)/(z-2). \n\nLooking at the options, let's see. Option D is (zy \u2013 2x)/(z-2). So that's the one. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't mix up any steps. So total sum is zy. Subtract the highest and lowest (which is 2x), then divide by z-2. Yep, that looks right.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting the given information:\n\n1. The average of the highest score \\( H \\) and the lowest score \\( L \\) is \\( x \\), so \\( \\frac{H + L}{2} = x \\), which implies \\( H + L = 2x \\).\n2. The average score for the entire class of \\( z \\) students is \\( y \\), so the total sum of all scores is \\( z \\cdot y \\).\n\nWe are tasked with finding the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers. To do this:\n\n1. Subtract \\( H \\) and \\( L \\) from the total sum of scores:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of scores excluding } H \\text{ and } L = zy - (H + L)\n   \\]\n2. Since \\( H + L = 2x \\), substitute this into the equation:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of scores excluding } H \\text{ and } L = zy - 2x\n   \\]\n3. Divide this sum by the number of remaining students, \\( z - 2 \\), to find the average:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Average score excluding } H \\text{ and } L = \\frac{zy - 2x}{z - 2}\n   \\]\n\nComparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: D**",
