      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out at what price Karan should mark up his sewing machine. The cost is Rs. 1200, and he wants to make a 20% profit even after giving a 20% discount. Hmm, let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you offer a discount, the selling price becomes a certain percentage of the marked price. So, if the discount is 20%, the customer pays 80% of the marked price.\n\nBut wait, Karan wants a 20% profit on his cost. His cost is 1200, so 20% profit would be 1200 plus 20% of that. Let me calculate that. 20% of 1200 is 240, so the selling price should be 1440. Right, because 1200 * 1.2 = 1440.\n\nNow, the selling price after discount is 1440. Since the selling price is 80% of the marked price, I can set up the equation: 80% of Marked Price = 1440. \n\nTo find the Marked Price (MP), I can rearrange that. MP = 1440 / 0.8. Let me calculate that. 1440 divided by 0.8 is... let's see, 1440 / 8 = 180, so 180 *10=1800. Oh wait, 0.8 is 8/10, so 1440 *10/8 = 1800. So MP is 1800.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 1800. But let me double-check because sometimes profit calculations can be tricky. So, if the marked price is 1800, and he gives 20% discount, the selling price is 80% of 1800, which is 1440. His cost is 1200, so 1440 - 1200 = 240, which is 20% of 1200. So yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but why are the other options there? Let me look again. The options are A)1,879, B)1,875, C)1,876, D)1,872, E)1,800. So E is 1800, which is what I got.\n\nHmm, but wait another thought. Sometimes, profit is calculated on selling price, not on cost. Oh wait, no, in this case, the problem says he makes 20% profit on his cost. Because the question says \"make 20% profit\", which usually refers to profit on cost. So I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nSo the marked price should be Rs. 1800, which is option E.\n",

Hmm, the cost price is Rs. 1200, and he wants to make a 20% profit even after giving a 20% discount. Wait, I'm a bit confused, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I think I need to understand what the desired profit is. He wants a 20% profit on the cost price. So his selling price after discount should be 1200 plus 20% of 1200. Let me calculate that. 20% of 1200 is 240, so the selling price after discount should be 1440. Right?\n\nWait, no. Wait, wait. Because the 20% is the profit, so the selling price (after discount) should be cost plus 20% of cost. So yes, 1200 * 1.2 = 1440. So he needs to sell it for 1440 after the discount.\n\nBut the discount is 20%, which means the selling price is 80% of the marked price. Because if the marked price is M, and he gives 20% off, then the selling price is M*(100-20)/100 = 0.8*M.\n\nSo, the equation would be: 0.8*M = 1440. Because that's the selling price he needs after discount.\n\nSo solving for M: M = 1440 / 0.8. Let me calculate that. 1440 divided by 0.8. Hmm, 0.8 is the same as 4/5, so dividing by 4/5 is the same as multiplying by 5/4. 1440 *5 is 7200, divided by 4 is 1800. So M should be 1800.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 1800. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Sometimes it's easy to get confused between profit percentage and markup.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's say he marks it up by x%, so the marked price is 1200 * (1 + x). Then, after giving 20% discount, the selling price is 80% of that, which is 1200*(1 + x)*0.8. He wants this to be equal to cost plus 20% profit, which is 1200 * 1.2.\n\nSo the equation is: 1200*(1 + x)*0.8 = 1200*1.2. Dividing both sides by 1200: (1 + x)*0.8 = 1.2. Then, (1 + x) = 1.2 / 0.8 = 1.5. So 1 + x = 1.5 \u2192 x = 0.5, which is 50% markup. So the marked price is 1200 * 1.5 = 1800. Yep, same as before. So option E is correct.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, Karan has a sewing machine that costs him Rs. 1200. He wants to set a price such that even after giving a 20% discount, he still makes a 20% profit. Hmm, I need to find out what price he should mark.\n\nWait, so let's break it down. First, I think I should find out what his selling price needs to be after the discount to make a 20% profit. Because profit is based on the cost price, right?\n\nHis cost is Rs. 1200. A 20% profit on that would be 20% of 1200. Let me calculate that. 20% is 0.2 in decimal. So 0.2 * 1200 = 240. So his selling price should be 1200 + 240 = 1440. Oh wait, no, that's not right. Wait, wait. Because the profit is on cost, so selling price is cost plus profit. So yeah, 1200 + 240 is 1440. So the selling price after discount should be 1440.\n\nBut that's after giving a 20% discount. So the marked price is the original price before discount. Let me think: if the selling price after 20% discount is 1440, what was the marked price?\n\nBecause when you give a discount, the selling price is (100% - discount%) of the marked price. So 20% discount means selling price is 80% of the marked price. So 80% of the marked price equals 1440.\n\nLet me write that as an equation. Let M be the marked price. So 0.8 * M = 1440. To find M, I divide both sides by 0.8.\n\nSo M = 1440 / 0.8. Let me calculate that. 1440 divided by 0.8. Hmm, 0.8 is 4/5, so dividing by 4/5 is same as multiplying by 5/4. So 1440 * 5 = 7200, divided by 4 is 1800. So M is 1800.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 1800. But wait, let me double-check my calculations. Because sometimes when I think I'm right, I might have made a mistake.\n\nSo, another way: If the marked price is 1800, and he gives 20% discount, the discount amount is 20% of 1800. 20% of 1800 is 360. So selling price is 1800 - 360 = 1440. Then, cost is 1200. Profit is 1440 - 1200 = 240. 240 is 20% of 1200, so yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again, option E is 1800.

      "full_content": "Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, Karan has a sewing machine that costs him Rs. 1200. He wants to set a price such that even after giving a 20% discount, he still makes a 20% profit. Hmm, I need to find out what price he should mark.\n\nWait, so let's break it down. First, I think I should find out what his selling price needs to be after the discount to make a 20% profit. Because profit is based on the cost price, right?\n\nHis cost is Rs. 1200. A 20% profit on that would be 20% of 1200. Let me calculate that. 20% is 0.2 in decimal. So 0.2 * 1200 = 240. So his selling price should be 1200 + 240 = 1440. Oh wait, no, that's not right. Wait, wait. Because the profit is on cost, so selling price is cost plus profit. So yeah, 1200 + 240 is 1440. So the selling price after discount should be 1440.\n\nBut that's after giving a 20% discount. So the marked price is the original price before discount. Let me think: if the selling price after 20% discount is 1440, what was the marked price?\n\nBecause when you give a discount, the selling price is (100% - discount%) of the marked price. So 20% discount means selling price is 80% of the marked price. So 80% of the marked price equals 1440.\n\nLet me write that as an equation. Let M be the marked price. So 0.8 * M = 1440. To find M, I divide both sides by 0.8.\n\nSo M = 1440 / 0.8. Let me calculate that. 1440 divided by 0.8. Hmm, 0.8 is 4/5, so dividing by 4/5 is same as multiplying by 5/4. So 1440 * 5 = 7200, divided by 4 is 1800. So M is 1800.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 1800. But wait, let me double-check my calculations. Because sometimes when I think I'm right, I might have made a mistake.\n\nSo, another way: If the marked price is 1800, and he gives 20% discount, the discount amount is 20% of 1800. 20% of 1800 is 360. So selling price is 1800 - 360 = 1440. Then, cost is 1200. Profit is 1440 - 1200 = 240. 240 is 20% of 1200, so yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again, option E is 1800. But wait, the options are A)1879, B)1875, C)1876, D)1872, E)1800. So E is 1800, which is what I got. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Sometimes profit is calculated on selling price, but I don't think so here. The question says he makes 20% profit, which is on cost. So yes, my initial approach is correct.\n\nSo the correct marked price is Rs. 1800, which is option E.\n\n\nTo determine the marked price Karan should set for the sewing machine, we start by calculating the selling price required to achieve a 20% profit on the cost price of Rs. 1200. A 20% profit on the cost price is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Profit} = 0.2 \\times 1200 = 240\n\\]\n\nThus, the selling price after the discount should be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Selling Price} = \\text{Cost Price} + \\text{Profit} = 1200 + 240 = 1440\n\\]\n\nSince Karan offers a 20% discount, the selling price is 80% of the marked price. Let \\( M \\) be the marked price. Then:\n\n\\[\n0.8 \\times M = 1440\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( M \\):\n\n\\[\nM = \\frac{1440}{0.8} = 1800\n\\]\n\nThus, the marked price should be Rs. 1800.

Let's see what the question is asking. \n\nThe problem is about Karan who wants to mark up the price of a sewing machine. The cost price for him is Rs. 1200. He plans to offer a 20% discount on the marked price, but even after that discount, he still wants to make a 20% profit. So, the question is, what should be the marked price?\n\nHmm. I remember that when you want to calculate the selling price after a discount, you have to consider the desired profit. Let me think about the steps involved here.\n\nFirst, I think the key is to find out what the selling price needs to be so that after giving a 20% discount, he still makes a 20% profit on his cost. So, his cost is Rs. 1200. He wants a 20% profit on this, which would be 20% of 1200. \n\nCalculating that profit: 20% of 1200 is (20/100)*1200 = 240. So, his selling price after the discount needs to be 1200 + 240 = Rs. 1440. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the selling price after discount is when you take the marked price and subtract 20% of it. So, the selling price is 80% of the marked price.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this step by step. Let me write down what I know.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- Cost price (CP) = Rs. 1200\n- Desired profit = 20% of CP\n- Discount offered = 20%\n- Marked price = M (this is what we need to find)\n- Selling price (SP) = M - (20% of M) = 0.8 * M\n\nHe wants the selling price to give him a 20% profit. So, the selling price should be equal to the cost plus 20% of the cost. \n\nSo, SP = CP + 20% of CP = 1200 + (0.2 * 1200) = 1200 + 240 = 1440.\n\nSo, SP is Rs. 1440. But SP is also equal to 0.8 * M. So, 0.8 * M = 1440.\n\nTo find M, we can rearrange that: M = 1440 / 0.8.\n\nLet me calculate that. 1440 divided by 0.8. Hmm, 0.8 is 4/5, so dividing by 4/5 is the same as multiplying by 5/4. So, 1440 * (5/4) = ?\n\nLet me compute 1440 divided by 4 first. 1440 /4 is 360. Then, 360 multiplied by 5 is 1800. So, M is 1800.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 1800. So that's the answer? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSo, the cost is 1200. 20% profit is 240, so selling price is 1440. Marked price is such that 80% of it is 1440. So, M = 1440 / 0.8 = 1800. Yep, that seems right.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 1800 as the first choice. Let me look again. Oh, option E is 1800. So, the correct answer should be E.\n\nBut wait, why are the other options there? Let me think. Maybe I made a mistake in the profit calculation. Oh, no, 20% of 1200 is 240. So, 1200 plus 240 is 1440. That's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about it in terms of the desired profit after the discount. Let me try another approach.\n\nThe selling price after discount needs to give a 20% profit on cost. So, selling price is 1200 * 1.2 = 1440. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the marked price is M, which when reduced by 20% gives 1440. So, M * 0.8 = 1440. M = 1440 / 0.8 = 1800.

Hmm, the cost price is Rs. 1200, and he wants to make a 20% profit even after giving a 20% discount. So I need to find the marked price that allows him to do that.\n\nWait, I think I should break this down. First, what's the selling price after the discount? Oh right, because the discount is on the marked price. So if he offers a 20% discount, the selling price would be 80% of the marked price. Because 100% minus 20% is 80%.\n\nBut he wants a 20% profit on the cost price. His cost is 1200, so 20% of that is 240. So the selling price should be 1200 + 240 = 1440. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, 20% profit on cost, so selling price is cost plus 20% of cost. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo the equation I think is: Selling Price = Marked Price * (100 - discount percentage)/100. So in this case, 80% of the marked price is the selling price.\n\nBut we know the selling price needs to be Rs. 1440. So,\n\n1440 = Marked Price * 0.8\n\nTo find the Marked Price, I should rearrange this. So Marked Price = 1440 / 0.8.\n\nLet me calculate that. 1440 divided by 0.8. Hmm, 0.8 times 1800 is 1440 because 1800 * 0.8 is 1440. Oh, wait, because 1800 * 0.8 = 1440. So the marked price is 1800.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option E is 1800. So that's the answer, right? Or am I making a mistake here?\n\nWait, let me double-check. So if the marked price is 1800, and he gives a 20% discount, the selling price is 1800 - (20% of 1800). 20% of 1800 is 360, so 1800 - 360 = 1440. Yes, that matches the required selling price which gives a 20% profit on 1200.\n\nSo yes, the correct marked price should be 1800. So the answer is E.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Karan marking up the price of a sewing machine. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the cost price is Rs. 1200, and he wants to make a 20% profit even after giving a 20% discount. So I need to find the marked price that allows him to do that.\n\nWait, I think I should break this down. First, what's the selling price after the discount? Oh right, because the discount is on the marked price. So if he offers a 20% discount, the selling price would be 80% of the marked price. Because 100% minus 20% is 80%.\n\nBut he wants a 20% profit on the cost price. His cost is 1200, so 20% of that is 240. So the selling price should be 1200 + 240 = 1440. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, 20% profit on cost, so selling price is cost plus 20% of cost. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo the equation I think is: Selling Price = Marked Price * (100 - discount percentage)/100. So in this case, 80% of the marked price is the selling price.\n\nBut we know the selling price needs to be Rs. 1440. So,\n\n1440 = Marked Price * 0.8\n\nTo find the Marked Price, I should rearrange this. So Marked Price = 1440 / 0.8.\n\nLet me calculate that. 1440 divided by 0.8.

He buys it for Rs. 1200, and he wants to set a price such that even after giving a 20% discount, he still makes a 20% profit. I need to find out what the marked price should be.\n\nWait, let me break it down. First, what's the cost price for Karan? That's Rs. 1200. He wants a 20% profit on that. So the selling price after the discount should give him 20% more than his cost. \n\nSo, the desired selling price is cost plus 20% of cost. Let me calculate that. 20% of 1200 is (20/100)*1200 = 240. So, the selling price needs to be 1200 + 240 = 1440 Rs. \n\nBut wait, that's the price after the discount. Because he's offering a 20% discount on the marked price. So, the selling price is 80% of the marked price. Oh right, because if you give a 20% discount, you're selling it for 80% of the original price. \n\nSo, let me denote the marked price as M. Then, after a 20% discount, the selling price S is 0.8 * M. And we know that S has to be 1440. So, 0.8 * M = 1440. \n\nTo find M, I can rearrange that equation. M = 1440 / 0.8. Let me compute that. 1440 divided by 0.8. Hmm, 1440 / 0.8 is the same as 1440 multiplied by 1.25. Because 1/0.8 is 1.25. \n\nSo, 1440 * 1.25. Let me calculate that step by step. 1440 * 1 is 1440. 1440 * 0.25 is 360. So adding them together, 1440 + 360 = 1800. \n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 1800. But wait, let me double-check because sometimes these problems can trick you. \n\nWait, Karan's cost is 1200. He wants a 20% profit on that. So, 20% of 1200 is 240, so selling price is 1440. Then, the discount is 20% on the marked price. So the equation is correct. M * 0.8 = 1440. So M is 1800. \n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 1800. But why are the other options like 1872 or 1875? Did I make a mistake? Let me go through the steps again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated 1440 / 0.8. Let me compute it again. 1440 divided by 0.8. 0.8 goes into 1440 how many times?\n\nAlternatively, 0.8 is 4/5, so dividing by 4/5 is the same as multiplying by 5/4. So 1440 * 5 = 7200, divided by 4 is 1800. Yes, same result. So M is 1800.\n\nSo the correct answer should be E) 1800. But wait, the options given are A)1879, B)1875, C)1876, D)1872, E)1800.
