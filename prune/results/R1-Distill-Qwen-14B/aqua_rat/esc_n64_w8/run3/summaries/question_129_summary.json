      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here. The question says that the difference between the squares of two numbers is 256,000 and their sum is 1000. I need to find which pair of numbers fits these conditions. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.\n\nHmm, let me think. I remember that when dealing with the difference of squares, there's a formula that can be helpful. Oh right, the difference of squares formula: a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a - b)(a + b). Oh wait, that's right! So in this case, the difference is 256,000, which is equal to (a - b)(a + b). And the sum a + b is given as 1000.\n\nSo substituting the values, I can set up the equation. Let me write this down:\n\na\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a - b)(a + b) = 256000\nBut a + b is 1000, so plugging that in:\n\n(a - b) * 1000 = 256000\n\nSo to find (a - b), I can divide both sides by 1000:\n\na - b = 256000 / 1000 = 256.\n\nWait, 256000 divided by 1000 is 256. So now I have two equations:\n\n1. a + b = 1000\n2. a - b = 256\n\nNow I can solve these two equations simultaneously. Let's add them together.\n\nAdding equation 1 and equation 2:\n\n(a + b) + (a - b) = 1000 + 256\n2a = 1256\n\nSo a = 1256 / 2 = 628.\n\nThen, substituting a back into equation 1:\n\n628 + b = 1000\nb = 1000 - 628 = 372.\n\nSo the two numbers are 628 and 372. Let me check the options. Option B is 628 and 372. So that should be the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's compute a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 with these numbers.\n\na = 628, b = 372.\n\nCompute a\u00b2: 628 squared. Let's calculate that. 600\u00b2 is 360,000. 28\u00b2 is 784. Then, 2*(600)(28) = 33,600. So 628\u00b2 = (600 + 28)^2 = 600\u00b2 + 2*600*28 + 28\u00b2 = 360,000 + 33,600 + 784 = 360,000 + 33,600 is 393,600, plus 784 is 394,384.\n\nb\u00b2 is 372 squared. Let me compute that. 370\u00b2 is 136,900. 2\u00b2 is 4. Then 2*(370)(2) is 1,480. So (370 + 2)^2 = 370\u00b2 + 2*370*2 + 2\u00b2 = 136,900 + 1,480 +4 = 138,384.\n\nNow subtract b\u00b2 from a\u00b2: 394,384 - 138,384 = 256,000. Oh, that's exactly the value given. So yes, this pair works.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B is 628 and 372, so that's correct. The other options: option C is 640 and 360. Let me quickly check their squares.\n\n640\u00b2 is 409,600. 360\u00b2 is 129,600. The difference would be 409,600 - 129,600 = 280,000. Which is higher than 256,000. So option C is out.\n\nOption A is 600 and 400. Their squares: 600\u00b2 is 360,000. 400\u00b2 is 160,000. Difference is 200,000. Not 256,000. So A is wrong.\n\nSo the correct answer is B.\n",

Also, x + y = 1,000.\n\nUsing the difference of squares formula: x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = (x - y)(x + y). We know x + y is 1,000, so substituting that in, we get (x - y)(1000) = 256,000. So, x - y must be 256,000 divided by 1,000. Let me calculate that: 256,000 / 1,000 is 256. So, x - y = 256.\n\nNow I have two equations:\n1. x + y = 1000\n2. x - y = 256\n\nI can solve these two equations together. Let's add them. Adding equation 1 and 2:\n\n(x + y) + (x - y) = 1000 + 256\n2x = 1256\nSo x = 1256 / 2 = 628.\n\nWait, that's 628. Then y would be 1000 - x, so 1000 - 628 is 372. So the two numbers are 628 and 372.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 628 and 372. So that should be the correct answer. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me verify the difference of their squares. Let's compute 628\u00b2 and 372\u00b2.\n\nCalculating 628 squared: 628 * 628. Hmm, maybe I can break it down. 600\u00b2 is 360,000. Then, (600 +28)\u00b2 = 600\u00b2 + 2*600*28 + 28\u00b2. So 360,000 + 33,600 + 784 = 360,000 + 33,600 is 393,600, plus 784 is 394,384.\n\nNow 372 squared: (370 + 2)\u00b2 = 370\u00b2 + 2*370*2 + 2\u00b2. 370\u00b2 is 136,900. 2*370*2 is 1,480. 2\u00b2 is 4. So 136,900 + 1,480 = 138,380, plus 4 is 138,384.\n\nNow the difference between 394,384 and 138,384 is 256,000. Yes, that's correct. So the numbers are indeed 628 and 372. So the answer is option B.\n\nWait, but let me make sure none of the other options could also satisfy the condition. For example, option C is 640 and 360. Let me check their squares.\n\n640 squared is 409,600. 360 squared is 129,600. The difference is 409,600 - 129,600 = 280,000. Which is more than 256,000. So that's not it.\n\nOption A: 600 and 400. 600 squared is 360,000. 400 squared is 160,000. The difference is 200,000. Not enough.\n\nOption D is none of these, but since option B works, D is incorrect. E is that it can't be determined, but we found the exact numbers, so E is wrong.\n\nSo yeah, I'm confident that B is the correct answer.\n",

Hmm, 370 squared is 136900. 2 squared is 4, and the cross term is 2*370*2=1480. So 372\u00b2 = (370+2)^2 = 370\u00b2 + 2*370*2 +2\u00b2 = 136900 +1480 +4 = 138384.\n\nNow subtracting the squares: 394384 - 138384 = 256000. Yep, that's correct. So the difference is 256000, and their sum is 628 + 372 = 1000. So it all checks out.\n\nLooking at the options, B is the one with 628 and 372. So the answer should be option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find two numbers. The difference between their squares is 256000, and their sum is 1000. Hmm, let's see how I can approach this.\n\nWait, I remember from algebra that there's a formula for the difference of squares. Oh right, a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 equals (a - b)(a + b). Oh yeah, that's the one. So maybe I can use that here.\n\nThe problem says a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 256000, and a + b = 1000. So according to the formula, (a - b)(a + b) = 256000. But since a + b is 1000, I can substitute that in. So it becomes (a - b) * 1000 = 256000.\n\nWait, so if I divide both sides by 1000, I'll get a - b equals 256. Oh right, because 256000 divided by 1000 is 256. So now I have two equations: a + b = 1000 and a - b = 256.\n\nNow I can solve these two equations together. Let me add them. If I add a + b and a - b, the b terms cancel. So (a + b) + (a - b) = 1000 + 256. That gives me 2a = 1256. So a is 1256 / 2, which is 628. Oh, so a is 628.\n\nThen I can find b by substituting back into a + b = 1000. So 628 + b = 1000. Subtracting 628 from both sides, b is 372.\n\nLet me check the options. Option B is 628 and 372.

Hmm, 370 squared is 136900. 2 squared is 4, and the cross term is 2*370*2=1480. So 372\u00b2 = (370+2)^2 = 370\u00b2 + 2*370*2 +2\u00b2 = 136900 +1480 +4 = 138384.\n\nNow subtracting the squares: 394384 - 138384 = 256000. Yep, that's correct.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000, and the sum of the numbers is 1000. I need to find the two numbers from the given options.\n\nWait, I remember that there's a formula for the difference of squares. Oh right, a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a - b)(a + b). Oh, that's useful because the problem gives both the difference of squares and the sum of the numbers. \n\nSo, the problem states that a + b = 1000. And a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 256000. Using the formula, a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 is (a - b)(a + b). Since a + b is 1000, that part is known. So substituting, (a - b)*1000 = 256000. \n\nLet me solve for (a - b). So, 256000 divided by 1000 is 256. So, a - b = 256. Now I have two equations: a + b = 1000 and a - b = 256. \n\nI can solve these two equations together. Adding them: (a + b) + (a - b) = 1000 + 256 \u2192 2a = 1256 \u2192 a = 628. Then, substituting back, 628 + b = 1000 \u2192 b = 372. \n\nWait, let me check the options. Option B is 628 and 372. So that's the pair. Let me verify with the given conditions. \n\nFirst, sum: 628 + 372 is 1000, that's correct. Now the squares: 628 squared and 372 squared. Hmm, 628 squared. Let's see, 600 squared is 360000. 28 squared is 784. Then, (600+28)^2 = 600\u00b2 + 2*600*28 + 28\u00b2 \u2192 360000 + 33600 + 784 = 360000 +33600 is 393600, plus 784 is 394384. \n\n372 squared: 370\u00b2 is 136900, 2\u00b2 is 4. So, (370+2)^2 = 370\u00b2 + 2*370*2 + 2\u00b2 \u2192 136900 + 1480 +4 = 136900+1480=138380, plus 4 is 138384. \n\nNow the difference: 394384 minus 138384. Let me subtract. 394384 - 138384 = 256000. Yes, that matches the given condition. \n\nSo the correct answer should be option B. Let me check the other options just in case. \n\nOption A: 600 and 400. Sum is 1000, that's good. Squares: 600\u00b2 is 360000, 400\u00b2 is 160000. Difference is 360000-160000=200000. But the problem says 256000, so A is wrong.\n\nOption C: 640 and 360. Sum is 1000. 640\u00b2 is 409600, 360\u00b2 is 129600. Difference is 409600-129600=280000. But we needed 256000, so C is also wrong.\n\nSo yes, option B is the correct one.\n\n\nThe problem states that the difference between the squares of two numbers is 256,000, and their sum is 1000. Using the difference of squares formula, \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\\), and substituting \\(a + b = 1000\\), we find \\(a - b = 256\\). Solving the system of equations:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\na + b = 1000 \\\\\na - b = 256\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nAdding the two equations gives \\(2a = 1256\\), so \\(a = 628\\). Substituting \\(a = 628\\) into \\(a + b = 1000\\) gives \\(b = 372\\). Thus, the two numbers are 628 and 372.\n\nTo verify, the sum of 628 and 372 is 1000, and their squares are \\(628^2 = 394,384\\) and \\(372^2 = 138,384\\). The difference \\(394,384 - 138,384 = 256,000\\), which matches the given condition.\n\nChecking the other options:\n- **Option A (600, 400):** Sum is 1000, but the difference of squares is \\(600^2 - 400^2 = 200,000\\), which does not match 256,000.\n- **Option C (640, 360):** Sum is 1000, but the difference of squares is \\(640^2 - 360^2 = 280,000\\), which also does not match 256,000.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **Option B (628, 372)**.\n\nAnswer: B",

I need to find which pair of numbers fits these conditions. The options are A to E, with E being \"Cannot be determined\" or something like that. \n\nHmm, let me think. I remember that when dealing with the difference of squares, there's a formula: a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a - b)(a + b). Oh wait, right! So if I have two numbers, say x and y, their squares' difference is (x - y)(x + y) = 256000. And I also know that x + y is 1000. That seems useful.\n\nSo, let me set up the variables. Let me call the two numbers x and y, where x is bigger than y. So, x + y = 1000, and x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 256000. Using the difference of squares, x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 is (x - y)(x + y). Substituting the known sum, that becomes (x - y)*1000 = 256000. \n\nSo I can solve for (x - y) by dividing both sides by 1000. That gives x - y = 256. Oh, that's right. So now I have two equations:\n\n1. x + y = 1000\n2. x - y = 256\n\nI can solve these two equations together. Let's add them. Adding equation 1 and 2: (x + y) + (x - y) = 1000 + 256. That simplifies to 2x = 1256. So x = 1256 / 2 = 628. \n\nThen, to find y, I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1. So (x + y) - (x - y) = 1000 - 256. That becomes 2y = 744. So y = 744 / 2 = 372. \n\nSo the two numbers are 628 and 372. Let me check the options. Option B is 628 and 372, so that's looking correct. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a calculation mistake. Let's verify both conditions. \n\nFirst, the sum: 628 + 372 = 1000. That's correct. Now, the difference of squares: 628\u00b2 minus 372\u00b2. Let me compute that. \n\nWait, I can compute it using the formula again. 628\u00b2 - 372\u00b2 = (628 - 372)(628 + 372) = (256)(1000) = 256000. Yep, that's exactly what the problem states. So that's correct. \n\nLet me just quickly check the other options to see if any of them might also fit, but I don't think so. Let's take option C: 640 and 360. Their sum is 1000, correct. Now, the difference of squares: 640\u00b2 - 360\u00b2. Let me compute that. \n\nAgain, using the formula: (640-360)(640+360) = 280 * 1000 = 280000. But the problem says 256000, so that's wrong. So option C is out. \n\nOption A: 600 and 400. Sum is 1000. Their squares' difference: 600\u00b2 -400\u00b2 = (200)(1000) = 200000, which is less than 256000.
