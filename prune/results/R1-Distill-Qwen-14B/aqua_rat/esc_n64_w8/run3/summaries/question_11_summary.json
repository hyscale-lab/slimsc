      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a company producing computer components. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The company makes 420 units each month, and each unit costs them $110 to produce. They sell all of them every month. The question is asking for the minimum selling price per component that will ensure their yearly profit is at least $626,400.\n\nHmm, profit is calculated as revenue minus costs. So I think I need to calculate the total revenue and total costs for a year and then set up an inequality to solve for the price.\n\nFirst, let me figure out how many months are in a year. Oh yeah, 12 months. So the total number of units produced in a year would be 420 units/month * 12 months. Let me calculate that. 420 * 12 is 5040 units per year.\n\nThe production cost per unit is $110, so the total production cost for the year is 5040 units * $110. Let me do that multiplication. 5040 * 110. Hmm, 5040*100 is 504,000, and 5040*10 is 50,400. So adding those together, 504,000 +50,400= 554,400. So the total cost is $554,400 per year.\n\nThe desired profit is $626,400. So the total revenue needed would be total cost plus desired profit. So that's $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800.\n\nRevenue is calculated as selling price per unit multiplied by the number of units sold. So revenue = price per unit * 5040 units. Let me write that as an equation: Revenue = p * 5040, where p is the price per unit.\n\nWe need the revenue to be at least $1,180,800. So:\n\np * 5040 \u2265 1,180,800\n\nTo find the minimum p, I'll solve for p by dividing both sides by 5040.\n\np \u2265 1,180,800 / 5040\n\nLet me compute that. Let's see, 1,180,800 divided by 5040. Hmm, perhaps simplifying the division.\n\nFirst, both numerator and denominator can be divided by 10: 118,080 / 504.\n\nHmm, 504 * 230 is what? Let me check. 504 * 200 is 100,800. 504*30 is 15,120. So 100,800 +15,120 = 115,920. That's 504 *230=115,920. But 118,080 is larger than that. Let me see how much more.\n\n118,080 - 115,920 = 2,160.\n\nNow, 504 *4 = 2,016. So 230 +4=234 gives 504*234=115,920 + 2,016=117,936. Hmm, but 118,080 is 117,936 + 144. 504 goes into 144 how many times? 144 /504 = 0.2857... So maybe 234.2857... So approximately 234.29.\n\nWait, but wait, that's 118,080 /504 \u2248 234.29. So p must be at least approximately $234.29 per unit.\n\nLooking at the options, the choices are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nWait, 234.29 is between 230 and 240. But the question asks for the minimum price that guarantees the profit. So the price needs to be at least 234.29, but the options don't have that. So the next higher option is C)240.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate the division: 1,180,800 /5040.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can break it down more simply.\n\n1,180,800 divided by 5040.\n\nLet me divide numerator and denominator by 10: 118,080 /504.\n\nWait, 504 * 200 is 100,800. Subtract that from 118,080: 118,080 -100,800=17,280.\n\nNow, 504 * 34 is 504*30=15,120 plus 504*4=2,016. So 15,120+2,016=17,136. So 34 *504=17,136.\n\nSubtract that from 17,280: 17,280 -17,136=144.\n\nNow, 144 is 504 * (144/504)= 0.2857... So total is 200 +34 +0.2857=234.2857.\n\nSo p must be at least approximately 234.29. Since the options don't have this, the next higher option is C)240. But wait, is 240 the minimum? Or is there a lower option that still meets or exceeds the required price?\n\nWait, the options are 226, 230, 240, etc. So 234 is between 230 and 240. So if the price is 230, what's the revenue?\n\nLet me calculate 230 *5040. 230 *5000 is 1,150,000. 230 *40=9,200. So total is 1,159,200. The required revenue is 1,180,800. So 1,159,200 is less than that. So 230 won't be enough.\n\nWhat about 240? 240 *5040 = ?\n\nLet me compute 240 *5000=1,200,000. 240 *40=9,600. So total is 1,209,600. Which is more than 1,180,800. So 240 is sufficient.\n\nBut wait, is 234.29 the exact value, so 234.29 would be the minimum. But since the options don't have that, the next higher option is 240, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options, option B is 230, which is lower than 234.29, so it's insufficient. So the minimum price is 234.29, but since 234 isn't an option, the next possible is 240. So the answer should be option C)240.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me go through it again.\n\nWait, the profit is revenue minus cost. So the profit per month is (price - cost per unit) * number of units per month.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it on a monthly basis instead of annual.\n\nWait, the question asks for the minimum price per component to guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps calculating the required profit per month, then the required per unit.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a simpler approach. Let's try that.\n\nTotal desired annual profit is $626,400. So per month, that's 626,400 /12=52,200 per month.\n\nEach month, the company sells 420 units. The cost per unit is $110, so cost per month is 420 *110=46,200.\n\nSo, the profit per month is (price per unit -110)*420. This should be \u226552,200.\n\nSo:\n\n( p -110 ) *420 \u226552,200\n\nDivide both sides by 420:\n\np -110 \u226552,200 /420\n\nWhat's 52,200 divided by 420?\n\nHmm, 420 *124=52,080. Because 420*100=42,000; 420*24=10,080. 42,000+10,080=52,080. So 52,200-52,080=120. 120/420= 0.2857.\n\nSo 52,200 /420= 124.2857.\n\nSo p -110 \u2265124.2857 \u2192 p \u2265 110 +124.2857 \u2192 p \u2265234.2857.\n\nAgain, same as before. So the minimum price is approximately $234.29.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest higher value is 240, which is option C. So the minimum price is 240.\n\nWait, but wait, another way to think: let me compute the exact division.\n\n52,200 \u00f7 420.\n\nLet me compute 52,200 \u00f7420. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 10: 5,220 \u00f742.\n\nHmm, 42 * 124 = 5,208. Because 42 *120=5,040 and 42*4=168 \u2192 5,040+168=5,208. 5,220-5,208=12.\n\nSo 42 into 5,220 is 124 with a remainder of 12. So 12/42=2/7\u22480.2857. So 124.2857.\n\nSo p must be \u2265110 +124.2857=234.2857.\n\nSo the minimum price is $234.29. Since the options don't have that, the next higher option is 240, which is option C.\n\nSo the answer should be C)240.\n",

Hmm, so first I should figure out how many they make in a year. Well, 12 months, right? So 420 times 12. Let me calculate that. 420 times 10 is 4200, and 420 times 2 is 840, so adding those together gives 5040 units per year. Got that.\n\nEach component costs them $110 to produce. So the total production cost per year would be 5040 units multiplied by $110. Wait, let me compute that. 5040 * 100 is 504,000, and 5040 *10 is 50,400. Adding those gives 554,400. So their yearly production cost is $554,400.\n\nThey want a yearly profit of at least $626,400. Profit is revenue minus costs, right? So the revenue needs to cover both the production cost and the desired profit. So total revenue required is 554,400 (cost) + 626,400 (profit) = 1,180,800 dollars.\n\nNow, revenue is the number of units sold multiplied by the selling price per unit. Since they sell all components each month, the total revenue for the year is 5040 units multiplied by the selling price (let's call it 'p').\n\nSo, 5040 * p = 1,180,800. To find p, I'll divide both sides by 5040.\n\nLet me compute 1,180,800 divided by 5040. Hmm, perhaps I can simplify this. Both numbers can be divided by 10, so 118,080 / 504.\n\nWait, maybe I can factor it more. Let's see: 5040 is 504 * 10. So 5040 = 504 * 10. Let me try to divide 1,180,800 by 5040.\n\nAnother approach: 5040 goes into 1,180,800 how many times? Let's see:\n\n5040 * 200 = 1,008,000. Because 5040*200=1,008,000. Then, 1,180,800 minus 1,008,000 is 172,800. Now, how many times does 5040 go into 172,800?\n\nLet's calculate 5040 * 34 = 5040 *30=151,200 and 5040*4=20,160. So 151,200+20,160=171,360. Hmm, 172,800 -171,360=1,440. 5040 * 0.2857 is about 1,440, because 5040 * 0.2857 = 5040*(2/7) = 1440. So 34.2857 times.\n\nWait, maybe I should just do the division properly. 1,180,800 \u00f7 5040.\n\nLet me write this as (1,180,800 \u00f7 5040) = ?\n\nAlternatively, 5040 = 504 *10. So 1,180,800 \u00f7 5040 = (1,180,800 \u00f7 10) \u00f7504 = 118,080 \u00f7 504.\n\nHmm, let's divide 118,080 by 504.\n\n504 * 234 = 504*(200 + 34) = 504*200=100,800 and 504*34=17,136. So 100,800 +17,136=117,936. Now, 118,080 -117,936=144. So 234 with a remainder of 144.\n\nSo 144/504 = 0.2857 approximately. So total is 234.2857.\n\nWait, but I'm trying to find the minimum price per component. So p must be at least 234.2857 dollars. But looking at the options, I see options A is 226, B is 230, C is 240, D is 260, E is 280.\n\nWait, so 234.2857 is approximately $234.29. But none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I should recheck the initial steps.\n\nWait, the problem says the company sells all components each month. So the total units per year are 420 *12=5040. That's correct.\n\nProduction cost is 110 per component. So yearly cost is 5040 *110 = 554,400. Correct.\n\nDesired profit is 626,400. So total revenue needed is 554,400 +626,400=1,180,800. Correct.\n\nRevenue is 5040 * p = 1,180,800. So p=1,180,800 /5040.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute 1,180,800 divided by 5040 more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 5040 \u00d7 234 = ?\n\n5040 \u00d7 200 = 1,008,000.\n\n5040 \u00d7 34: 5040 \u00d7 30=151,200; 5040 \u00d74=20,160. So 151,200 +20,160=171,360.\n\nTotal 1,008,000 +171,360=1,179,360.\n\nSubtracting from 1,180,800: 1,180,800 -1,179,360=1,440.\n\nSo 1,440 /5040 = 0.2857.\n\nSo p is 234.2857, so approximately $234.29.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest higher option is 240 (Option C). Because 234.29 is lower than 240 but higher than 230. But wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, the question asks for the minimum selling price per component to guarantee the profit. So p must be at least 234.29. So any price equal to or higher than that would work.\n\nBut the options are in whole numbers. So the smallest option that is higher or equal to 234.29 is 240. Because 230 is lower than 234.29, which would not be enough. So the minimum price is 234.29, but since the options are given, the next higher option is 240.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me compute 5040 \u00d7 234 = 5040*(200+34) = 5040*200=1,008,000 and 5040*34.\n\nWait, 5040 \u00d730 is 151,200 and 5040 \u00d74=20,160. So 151,200+20,160=171,360. So 1,008,000 +171,360=1,179,360. So 5040 \u00d7234=1,179,360. Then 5040 \u00d7234.2857=1,180,800.\n\nSo the exact price is 234.2857.\n\nLooking at the options, the only higher options are 230, 240, etc. So 230 is less than 234.2857, so it's insufficient. The next higher option is 240, which is higher, so that would ensure the profit.\n\nWait, but what if 230 is the option? Let's see, if p is 230, then revenue is 5040 \u00d7230 = ?\n\n5040 \u00d7200 = 1,008,000.\n\n5040 \u00d730=151,200.\n\nTotal is 1,008,000 +151,200=1,159,200.\n\nSubtracting cost: 1,159,200 -554,400 = 604,800 profit. Which is less than the desired 626,400. So 230 is insufficient.\n\nIf p is 240: 5040 \u00d7240 = ?\n\n5040 \u00d7200=1,008,000.\n\n5040 \u00d740=201,600.\n\nTotal is 1,008,000 +201,600=1,209,600.\n\nProfit is 1,209,600 -554,400=655,200, which is above 626,400. So 240 would work.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the minimum is 234.29, but the options don't have that. So the correct choice is the smallest option that is equal or higher than 234.29, which is 240. So the answer would be option C, 240.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is 230, which is lower than 234.29, so not enough. So 240 is the next possible choice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me recheck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact minimum price, then see which option is the smallest that is not less than that.\n\nWait, let me compute 1,180,800 divided by 5040.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: 118,080 /504.\n\nLet me see, 504 \u00d7 234 = ?\n\n504 \u00d7 200 = 100,800.\n\n504 \u00d734 = 17,136. So 100,800 +17,136=117,936.\n\n118,080 -117,936=144.\n\nSo 504 \u00d7 x = 144. So x=144/504 = 12/42 = 2/7 \u2248 0.2857.\n\nSo 234 + 0.2857 = 234.2857.\n\nSo p must be at least $234.29 per component.\n\nLooking at the options again, the possible options are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nSo the smallest option that is \u2265234.29 is 240 (option C). So the correct answer is C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a company producing computer components. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Hmm, the company makes 420 units each month. So, for a year, that's 12 months, right? So 420 multiplied by 12. Let me calculate that. 420 times 12 is... 420*10 is 4200, and 420*2 is 840, so adding them gives 5040 units per year. Got that down.\n\nEach component costs them $110 to produce. So the total production cost per year would be the number of units times the cost per unit. So 5040 units times $110. Let me compute that. 5040 * 100 is 504,000, and 5040*10 is 50,400. Adding those together gives 554,400. So their total cost is $554,400 per year.\n\nNow, the company wants a yearly profit of at least $626,400. Profit is revenue minus costs, right? So profit equals revenue minus cost. They want profit to be >= $626,400. So revenue needs to be at least cost plus profit. That would be $554,400 + $626,400. Let me add those: 554,400 + 626,400. Hmm, 500k + 600k is 1.1 million, and 54,400 + 26,400 is 80,800. So total revenue needs to be at least $1,180,800.\n\nRevenue is the number of units sold times the selling price per unit. They sell all 5040 units each year. So revenue is 5040 * price. We need 5040 * price >= 1,180,800. To find the minimum price, we can rearrange that. Price >= 1,180,800 / 5040.\n\nLet me compute that division. Let me see, 5040 goes into 1,180,800 how many times. Hmm, 5040 * 200 is 1,008,000. Because 5040 * 200 = 1,008,000. Subtract that from 1,180,800: 1,180,800 - 1,008,000 = 172,800. Now, how many times does 5040 go into 172,800? Let's see, 5040 * 34 is 5040*30=151,200 and 5040*4=20,160. So 151,200 +20,160=171,360. That's 34 times. So 172,800 minus 171,360 is 1,440 left. Then 5040 goes into 1,440 0.286 times (since 5040 * 0.286 \u2248 1440). Wait, but maybe I should compute it more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to divide 1,180,800 by 5040. Let me try that. Let's see, 5040 * 234 = ? Wait, maybe I can factor it. 5040 is 504*10. Let me see, 1,180,800 divided by 5040 equals (1,180,800 / 10) divided by 504. So 118,080 / 504. Let's compute that. \n\nDividing 118,080 by 504. Let's see, 504 * 200 is 100,800. Subtract that from 118,080: 118,080 - 100,800 = 17,280. Now, 504 * 34 is 504*(30+4)=15,120 + 2,016=17,136. So 17,280 -17,136=144. So 504 * 0.2857 is about 144. So total is 200 +34 +0.2857\u2248234.2857. So 234.2857. So the price needs to be at least approximately $234.29. But since you can't have a fraction of a dollar in this context, we'd need to round up to the next whole dollar, which is $235. But wait, looking at the options, the options are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280. Hmm, none of these is 235. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, let me double-check my math. Maybe I messed up the numbers somewhere. Let's recalculate the total revenue needed.\n\nTotal cost per year: 420 units/month * 12 months = 5040 units. 5040 * $110 = $554,400. Profit desired is $626,400. So revenue needed is 554,400 + 626,400 = 1,180,800.\n\nSo revenue = units * price. So price = 1,180,800 / 5040.\n\nLet me compute 1,180,800 divided by 5040.\n\nWait, 5040 * 200 = 1,008,000. That leaves 1,180,800 -1,008,000 = 172,800.\n\nNow, 5040 * 34 = 171,360. So 172,800 - 171,360 = 1,440.\n\nNow, 5040 * 0.2857 is 1,440 because 5040 * 0.2857 \u2248 1440. So 200 +34 +0.2857=234.2857. So the price per unit needs to be at least approximately $234.29. Since the options don't have that, the next higher option is C)240. But wait, maybe I should check again if I did the division correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute 5040 into 1,180,800.\n\nLet me think of 5040 as 504 * 10.\n\nSo 1,180,800 / 5040 = (1,180,800 / 10) /504 = 118,080 /504.\n\nNow, 504 * 234 = ?\n\nLet me compute 504 * 234.\n\nBreak it down: 504*(200 +30 +4) = 504*200 = 100,800; 504*30=15,120; 504*4=2,016. So adding them: 100,800 +15,120 =115,920; +2,016 =117,936. So 504*234=117,936.\n\nBut 118,080 is 118,080 -117,936 = 144 higher. So 234 + (144/504) = 234 + 0.2857 = 234.2857. So same result.\n\nSo the price per component needs to be $234.2857. Since the price must be in whole dollars, the company needs to set the price at $235 to cover that. But none of the options are 235. The closest higher option is C)240. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nWait, let me check another approach. Maybe the problem is asking for the minimum selling price, but perhaps I should calculate monthly profit and then multiply by 12, but that's probably the same. Let me think: No, the question is about the yearly profit, so I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the total cost. Let me recheck that. The company produces 420 units a month at $110 each. So monthly cost is 420 *110 = $46,200. So yearly cost is 46,200 *12. Let's compute that: 46,200 *10=462,000; 46,200*2=92,400. So 462,000 +92,400 =554,400. That's correct.\n\nSo total cost is correct. Profit needed is 626,400. So revenue must be 554,400 +626,400 =1,180,800.\n\nNow, revenue is 5040 * price. So price is 1,180,800 /5040.\n\nLet me compute this division again. Maybe I can simplify the numbers. Let's see, 1,180,800 \u00f75040.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: 118,080 \u00f7504.\n\nHmm, 504 x 200 is 100,800. Subtract that from 118,080: 17,280 left.\n\n504 x34 is 17,136. So 17,280 -17,136=144.\n\nSo 504 x 0.2857 is 144. So 200+34=234, plus 0.2857. So 234.2857, same as before.\n\nSo the minimum price is approximately $234.29. Since the options are in whole dollars, and the next higher option is 240, but let's see if 234.29 is in the options. The options are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280. So 230 is lower than 234, which would give a lower revenue. So 230 would not be enough. Let's check what revenue 230 would generate: 5040 *230=?\n\n5040 *200=1,008,000; 5040 *30=151,200. So total 1,159,200. Then subtract cost 554,400: profit is 1,159,200-554,400=604,800. But they need 626,400, which is higher. So 230 isn't enough. What about 235? 5040 *235=?\n\nWell, 5040 *234=1,177, (wait, 5040*234=1,177,920). Adding 5040: 1,177,920 +5040=1,182,960. So revenue would be 1,182,960. Profit would be 1,182,960 -554,400=628,560, which is above 626,400. So 235 would work. But since 235 isn't an option, the next higher option is 240.\n\nWait, but let me check what 240 gives. 5040 *240=1,209,600. Profit is 1,209,600 -554,400=655,200, which is more than enough. But is there a lower price in the options that would still meet the required profit?\n\nLooking at the options, the next lower option is B)230, which as I calculated earlier, gives a profit of only 604,800, which is less than required. So the next possible option is C)240.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The problem says \"the minimum selling price per component.\" So if the calculation comes to approximately 234.29, the next whole number is 235, but since 235 isn't an option, we have to choose the next available option which is higher than 234.29. The options are B)230, which is lower than 234.29, so it's insufficient. The next option is C)240, which is higher than 234.29, so that would be sufficient. So the correct answer must be C)240.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me think again. Maybe I should compute 5040 * price >=1,180,800.\n\nSo, price >= 1,180,800 /5040.\n\nLet me compute that using a calculator approach. 5040 \u00d7 234 = 5040 *200=1,008,000; 5040*34=171,360. So 1,008,000 +171,360=1,179,360. Hmm, that's 1,179,360. Which is less than 1,180,800. So 234 would give revenue of 1,179,360, which is 1,180,800 minus 1,179,360=1,440 short. So 234 is insufficient. So the price needs to be 235 to cover that. So, since 235 isn't an option, the next higher is 240. So the correct answer is C)240.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a company producing computer components. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Hmm, the company makes 420 units each month. So, for a year, that's 12 months, right? So 420 multiplied by 12. Let me calculate that. 420 times 12 is... 420*10 is 4200, and 420*2 is 840, so adding them gives 5040 units per year. Got that down.\n\nEach component costs them $110 to produce. So the total production cost per year would be the number of units times the cost per unit. So 5040 units times $110. Let me compute that. 5040 * 100 is 504,000, and 5040*10 is 50,400. Adding those together gives 554,400. So their total cost is $554,400 per year.\n\nNow, the company wants a yearly profit of at least $626,400. Profit is revenue minus costs, right? So profit equals revenue minus cost. They want profit to be >= $626,400. So revenue needs to be at least cost plus profit. That would be $554,400 + $626,400. Let me add those: 554,400 + 626,400. Hmm, 500k + 600k is 1.1 million, and 54,400 + 26,400 is 80,800. So total revenue needs to be at least $1,180,800.\n\nRevenue is the number of units sold times the selling price per unit.

Price >= 1,180,800 / 5040.\n\nLet me compute that division. Let me see, 5040 goes into 1,180,800 how many times. Hmm, 5040 * 200 is 1,008,000. Because 5040 * 200 = 1,008,000. Subtract that from 1,180,800: 1,180,800 - 1,008,000 = 172,800. Now, how many times does 5040 go into 172,800? Let's see, 5040 * 34 is 5040*30=151,200 and 5040*4=20,160. So 151,200 +20,160=171,360. That's 34 times. So 172,800 minus 171,360 is 1,440 left. Then 5040 goes into 1,440 0.286 times (since 5040 * 0.286 \u2248 1440). Wait, but maybe I should compute it more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to divide 1,180,800 by 5040. Let me try that. Let's see, 5040 * 234 = ?

Let's see, 504 * 200 is 100,800. Subtract that from 118,080: 118,080 - 100,800 = 17,280. Now, 504 * 34 is 504*(30+4)=15,120 + 2,016=17,136. So 17,280 -17,136=144. So 504 * 0.2857 is about 144.

So total 1,159,200. Then subtract cost 554,400: profit is 1,159,200-554,400=604,800. But they need 626,400, which is higher. So 230 isn't enough. What about 235? 5040 *235=?\n\nWell, 5040 *234=1,177, (wait, 5040*234=1,177,920). Adding 5040: 1,177,920 +5040=1,182,960. So revenue would be 1,182,960. Profit would be 1,182,960 -554,400=628,560, which is above 626,400. So 235 would work. But since 235 isn't an option, the next higher option is 240.\n\nWait, but let me check what 240 gives. 5040 *240=1,209,600. Profit is 1,209,600 -554,400=655,200, which is more than enough. But is there a lower price in the options that would still meet the required profit?\n\nLooking at the options, the next lower option is B)230, which as I calculated earlier, gives a profit of only 604,800, which is less than required. So the next possible option is C)240.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The problem says \"the minimum selling price per component.\" So if the calculation comes to approximately 234.29, the next whole number is 235, but since 235 isn't an option, we have to choose the next available option which is higher than 234.29. The options are B)230, which is lower than 234.29, so it's insufficient. The next option is C)240, which is higher than 234.29, so that would be sufficient. So the correct answer must be C)240.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me think again. Maybe I should compute 5040 * price >=1,180,800.\n\nSo, price >= 1,180,800 /5040.\n\nLet me compute that using a calculator approach. 5040 \u00d7 234 = 5040 *200=1,008,000; 5040*34=171,360. So 1,008,000 +171,360=1,179,360. Hmm, that's 1,179,360. Which is less than 1,180,800. So 234 would give revenue of 1,179,360, which is 1,180,800 minus 1,179,360=1,440 short. So 234 is insufficient. So the price needs to be 235 to cover that. So, since 235 isn't an option, the next higher is 240. So the correct answer is C)240.\n\n\nTo determine the minimum selling price per component that guarantees a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we start by calculating the total number of components produced annually. The company produces 420 units per month, so over 12 months, it produces:\n\n\\[\n420 \\times 12 = 5040 \\, \\text{units/year}.\n\\]\n\nThe production cost per unit is $110, so the total annual production cost is:\n\n\\[\n5040 \\times 110 = 554,400 \\, \\text{dollars}.\n\\]\n\nThe company aims for a yearly profit of at least $626,400. Profit is defined as revenue minus costs, so the required revenue is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Revenue} = \\text{Cost} + \\text{Profit} = 554,400 + 626,400 = 1,180,800 \\, \\text{dollars}.\n\\]\n\nRevenue is also calculated as the number of units sold multiplied by the selling price per unit. Let \\( p \\) represent the selling price per unit. Then:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Revenue} = 5040 \\times p \\geq 1,180,800.\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( p \\):\n\n\\[\np \\geq \\frac{1,180,800}{5040} \\approx 234.29.\n\\]\n\nSince the selling price must be a whole number, the minimum price per unit is $235. However, none of the provided options include $235. The next higher option is $240. To verify, if the selling price is $240, the annual revenue would be:\n\n\\[\n5040 \\times 240 = 1,209,600 \\, \\text{dollars}.\n\\]\n\nThe profit would then be:\n\n\\[\n1,209,600 - 554,400 = 655,200 \\, \\text{dollars},\n\\]\n\nwhich exceeds the required profit of $626,400. Checking the next lower option, $230, the annual revenue would be:\n\n\\[\n5040 \\times 230 = 1,159,200 \\, \\text{dollars}.\n\\]\n\nThe profit would be:\n\n\\[\n1,159,200 - 554,400 = 604,800 \\, \\text{dollars},\n\\]\n\nwhich is less than the required profit. Therefore, $230 is insufficient, and the minimum selling price must be $240.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the company produces 420 units each month, and each costs $110 to produce. They sell all of them every month. We need to find the minimum selling price per component that ensures their yearly profit is at least $626,400. Hmm.\n\nWait, profit is calculated as revenue minus costs. Right. So first, maybe I should calculate the total production cost per month and then per year. Let me think.\n\nEach month, they produce 420 units, each costing $110. So the monthly production cost is 420 multiplied by 110. Let me calculate that: 420 * 110. Hmm, 400*110 is 44,000, and 20*110 is 2,200. So 44k + 2.2k = 46,200 dollars per month. \n\nSo for the year, that's 12 times that amount. Let's see, 46,200 * 12. Let me compute that. 46,200 * 10 is 462,000, and 46,200 *2 is 92,400. So 462k +92.4k = 554,400 dollars per year in production costs.\n\nNow, the revenue is the number of units sold each month multiplied by the selling price. They sell all 420 each month, so monthly revenue is 420 * price per unit. Let's call the price 'p'. So monthly revenue is 420p, and yearly revenue is 12 * 420p = 5040p.\n\nWait, no, 420 per month times 12 months is 5040 units per year. So revenue is 5040p.\n\nProfit is revenue minus costs. So, yearly profit = 5040p - 554,400. We want this profit to be at least $626,400. \n\nSo the inequality is: 5040p - 554400 >= 626400.\n\nLet me solve for p.\n\nFirst, add 554,400 to both sides: 5040p >= 626400 + 554400.\n\nWait, 626,400 plus 554,400. Let me add those. 626,400 + 554,400. Let's see, 600k +500k is 1.1 million. 26,400 +54,400 is 80,800. So total is 1,180,800. So 5040p >= 1,180,800.\n\nNow, divide both sides by 5040 to get p. Let's compute 1,180,800 /5040.\n\nHmm, let's see. Maybe simplify the division. Both numbers can be divided by 100 first? No, 5040 is 5040, 1,180,800 is 1,180,800.\n\nAlternatively, let's break it down. 5040 is 504 *10. So 1,180,800 divided by 5040 is same as (1,180,800 /10)/504 = 118,080 /504.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can divide numerator and denominator by 24? Let's see: 118,080 \u00f724 is 4920, 504 \u00f724 is 21. So now it's 4920 /21.\n\nWait, 21 times 234 is 4914 (since 200*21=4200, 34*21=714; 4200+714=4914). 4914 is 21*234. So 4920 is 4914+6, which is 21*234 +6. So 4920/21 = 234 +6/21 = 234 + 2/7 \u2248234.2857.\n\nWait, that's p \u2248234.2857. But we can't sell at a fraction of a dollar, I guess, or maybe the options are in whole numbers. So p has to be at least approximately 234.2857. But looking at the options, the choices are 226, 230, 240, etc. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, let me recompute 5040p >= 1,180,800.\n\nCompute 1,180,800 /5040.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's divide both numerator and denominator by 10: 118080 /504.\n\nHmm, 504 \u00d7 234 = let's compute 504 \u00d7200=100,800; 504\u00d734= 504\u00d730=15,120 and 504\u00d74=2,016. So 15,120 +2,016=17,136. So 100,800 +17,136=117,936. \n\nSo 504 \u00d7234 = 117,936. But our numerator is 118,080. So 118,080 -117,936 =144. So 118,080 =504 \u00d7234 +144. \n\nNow, 144 is 504 \u00d7 (144/504) = 504 \u00d7 (12/42) = 504 \u00d7 (2/7) \u2248 144/504= 0.2857. So 144 is 504 \u00d7 0.2857.\n\nSo 118080 /504 =234 + 0.2857 \u2248234.2857.\n\nSo p must be at least approximately 234.2857. Since you can't sell at a fraction, you'd need to round up to the next whole dollar, which is 235. But none of the options are 235. Wait, the options are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nHmm. So 234.2857 is between 230 and 240. So the next possible option higher than 234 is 240. So the minimum price would be 240, which is option C.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Let me check if 230 is sufficient. Let me compute the profit if p=230.\n\nCompute revenue: 5040 *230 = ?\n\n5040 *200=1,008,000. 5040*30=151,200. So total 1,008,000 +151,200 = 1,159,200.\n\nProfit =1,159,200 -554,400= 604,800.\n\nBut we needed at least 626,400. 604,800 is less than 626,400. So 230 is not enough. What about 240?\n\nRevenue:5040 *240. 5040 *200=1,008,000. 5040 *40=201,600. Total 1,209,600.\n\nProfit:1,209,600 -554,400=655,200. That's more than 626,400. So 240 is sufficient. But maybe there's a lower price that's an option and still meets the requirement. The options don't have 235, but the next higher option is 240, so that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. What about 234.2857? The exact value is about 234.2857, so any price above that is acceptable. But since the options don't have 235, the next higher is 240. So the correct option is C)240.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe company produces 420 units of a computer component every month. Each component costs them $110 to produce. They sell all the components by the end of each month. The question is asking for the minimum selling price per component that will ensure the yearly profit is at least $626,400. Profit is defined as revenue from sales minus production costs. The options are A to E, with various prices.\n\nAlright, so first, I think I need to figure out the total production cost for a year. Then, calculate the required revenue to reach the desired profit. Once I have that, I can find out the total revenue needed and then determine the price per unit.\n\nLet me start breaking it down.\n\nThe company makes 420 units each month. So, for a year, which I assume is 12 months, the total number of units produced would be 420 multiplied by 12. Let me compute that: 420 *12. Hmm, 400*12 is 4800, and 20*12 is 240, so total is 5040 units per year.\n\nEach unit costs $110 to produce. So the total production cost per year is 5040 units multiplied by $110. Let's calculate that. 5040 *110. Let me think: 5040 *100 is 504,000, and 5040 *10 is 50,400. Adding those together gives 554,400. So the total cost is $554,400 per year.\n\nThey want a yearly profit of at least $626,400. Profit is revenue minus cost. So, revenue needs to be cost plus profit. So, revenue = 554,400 + 626,400. Let me add those numbers. 554,400 + 626,400. Hmm, 554,400 + 600,000 is 1,154,400, plus 26,400 gives 1,180,800. So the revenue needs to be at least $1,180,800 per year.\n\nNow, the revenue is the selling price per unit multiplied by the number of units sold. Since they sell all 420 units every month, over a year that's 5040 units. So, revenue = price per unit * 5040.\n\nWe need to find the minimum price (let's call it P) such that P *5040 >= 1,180,800.\n\nSo, rearranging that, P >= 1,180,800 /5040.\n\nLet me compute that division. Hmm, 1,180,800 divided by 5040.\n\nI think I can simplify this. Let's see, 5040 is the denominator.\n\nLet me divide both numerator and denominator by 10 first. 1,180,800 becomes 118,080 and 5040 becomes 504.\n\nNow, 118,080 \u00f7 504. Let me see if I can break this down further.\n\nI know that 504 * 200 is 100,800. Because 500 *200 is 100,000, and 4*200 is 800, so total 100,800. Subtracting that from 118,080 gives 17,280 left.\n\nNow, 504 * 34 is let's see: 504 *30 is 15,120, 504 *4 is 2,016. So 15,120 + 2,016 is 17,136. Hmm, close to 17,280. The difference is 17,280 -17,136=144. 504 * 0.2857 is about 144, because 504 * (1/7) is 72, so 504 * (2/7) is 144. So that would be 34.2857 approximately.\n\nSo, 200 +34.2857 is 234.2857. So approximately 234.29 per unit.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the division to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute 1,180,800 /5040.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's compute 5040 * 234.\n\n5040 *200 =1,008,000.\n\n5040 *34: let's compute 5040 *30=151,200; 5040*4=20,160. So 151,200 +20,160=171,360.\n\nSo, 200+34=234: 1,008,000 +171,360=1,179,360.\n\nBut our required revenue is 1,180,800. So 1,179,360 is 1,440 less than needed. So 1,180,800 -1,179,360=1,440.\n\nSo, 5040 * x =1,440. x=1,440/5040. Simplify that: both divided by 720, 1,440/720=2, 5040/720=7. So 2/7. So x= 2/7 \u22480.2857.\n\nSo total P=234 + 0.2857\u2248234.2857.\n\nSo the price per unit needs to be at least approximately $234.29.\n\nLooking at the options, the choices are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nSo the closest higher value is C)240, since 234.29 is between 230 and 240. But wait, the options don't have 234, so the minimum price must be the next higher option provided. So 230 is 230, which is below 234.29, so that won't be enough. So the next is 240, which is higher than 234.29, so that would suffice.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Let me compute the revenue if the price is $230. Let's see, 230 *5040= ?\n\n230 *5000=1,150,000. 230*40=9,200. So total is 1,159,200. But the required revenue is 1,180,800. So 1,159,200 is less than needed. So 230 is too low.\n\nWhat about 240? 240 *5040= ?\n\n240 *5000=1,200,000. 240 *40=9,600. So total 1,209,600. Which is higher than 1,180,800. So 240 is sufficient. But is there a lower option than 240 that would also work? Let's check option B)230, which we saw doesn't work. So the next is option C)240.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the division earlier. Let me compute 1,180,800 \u00f75040 again more accurately.\n\nCompute 1,180,800 \u00f75040.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: 118,080 \u00f7504.\n\nLet me compute 504 \u00d7 234: 504*(200+34)=504*200=100,800; 504*34=17,136. So 100,800 +17,136=117,936.\n\nSo 234 gives 117,936. The target is 118,080. The difference is 144. So 144/504 = 0.2857... So 234.2857.\n\nSo the price needs to be at least 234.2857. So the options given are 226,230,240, etc. So the minimum price is 240.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check the exact calculation. Let me compute 234.2857 *5040 to see if it's exactly 1,180,800.\n\n234.2857 *5040 = ?\n\nWell, 234 *5040=1,179,360. 0.2857*5040=1440 (because 0.2857 is approx 2/7, and 5040*(2/7)=1440). So 1,179,360 +1,440=1,180,800. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the minimum price is just over 234.2857. But since the options don't have that, the next possible option is 240.\n\nWait, but maybe I should think about whether 230 is close enough. Let me compute the revenue with 230. 230 *5040=230 *5040.\n\n230 *5040: Let me compute 200*5040=1,008,000. 30*5040=151,200. So total is 1,159,200.\n\nWhich is 1,159,200. The required is 1,180,800. So 1,180,800 -1,159,200=21,600 less. So 230 is insufficient.\n\nWhat about 235? Let's see. 235 *5040=?\n\n235 *5000=1,175,000. 235 *40=9,400. So total 1,184,400. Which is more than 1,180,800. So 235 is sufficient. But the options don't have 235. So the next higher option is 240.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check if 234.29 is an option. It's not; the options are 226,230,240, etc. So 240 is the first option that's higher than 234.29.\n\nSo the correct answer must be option C)240.\n",

Thus:  \n   \\[\n   P \\times 5040 \\geq 1,180,800.\n   \\]  \n   Solving for \\(P\\):  \n   \\[\n   P \\geq \\frac{1,180,800}{5040} \\approx 234.29 \\, \\text{dollars}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Selecting the Minimum Selling Price from Options**:  \n   Among the given options (A) 226, (B) 230, (C) 240, (D) 260, (E) 280), the smallest value greater than or equal to 234.29 is **240**.  \n\n5. **Verification**:  \n   - At \\(P = 230\\), the total revenue would be:  \n     \\[\n     230 \\times 5040 = 1,159,200 \\, \\text{dollars},\n     \\]  \n     which is less than the required revenue of $1,180,800.  \n   - At \\(P = 240\\), the total revenue would be:  \n     \\[\n     240 \\times 5040 = 1,209,600 \\, \\text{dollars},\n     \\]  \n     which is sufficient to meet the required revenue.\n\nThus, the minimum selling price per component that guarantees the desired profit is **240 dollars**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. Let me read it again and understand what's being asked.\n\nThe company produces 420 units of a computer component each month. Each unit costs them $110 to produce. They sell all of them by the end of each month. The question is about finding the minimum selling price per component to ensure that the yearly profit is at least $626,400. The options are A to E.\n\nHmm, profit is calculated as revenue minus costs. So I need to figure out the total revenue needed for the year, subtract the total costs, and set that to be at least $626,400.\n\nLet me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's find the monthly cost. They make 420 units each month at $110 each. So the monthly cost is 420 multiplied by 110. Let me calculate that.\n\n420 * 110. Let's see, 400*110 is 44,000, and 20*110 is 2,200. So 44,000 + 2,200 = 46,200. So each month they spend $46,200 on production.\n\nNow, the yearly production cost would be 12 times that. 46,200 *12. Let me calculate that. 46,200 *10 is 462,000, 46,200*2 is 92,400. So adding them gives 462,000 +92,400 = 554,400. So the total cost per year is $554,400.\n\nWait, but the profit needs to be at least $626,400. So the total revenue should be total cost plus desired profit. So revenue = cost + profit.\n\nWait, no, profit is revenue minus cost. So profit >= 626,400.\n\nSo, revenue - cost >= 626,400.\n\nSo, revenue >= 626,400 + cost.\n\nBut the cost is 554,400. So revenue needs to be at least 626,400 + 554,400.\n\nAdding those: 626,400 + 554,400. Let's see, 600,000 + 500,000 is 1.1 million. Then 26,400 + 54,400 is 80,800. So total is 1,180,800. So revenue needs to be at least $1,180,800 per year.\n\nBut the company sells all components each month. So revenue per month is price per unit multiplied by 420 units. Let me call the selling price 'p'. So monthly revenue is 420 * p.\n\nYearly revenue would be 12 * (420 * p) = 5040 * p.\n\nWe need 5040 * p >= 1,180,800.\n\nSo p >= 1,180,800 / 5040.\n\nLet me calculate that division.\n\nFirst, let me see if I can simplify the numbers. Let's see, 5040 is the denominator, 1,180,800 is numerator.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: 118,080 / 504.\n\nHmm, 504 * 234 = let me see. 504*200=100,800. 504*34=17,136. So 100,800 +17,136 =117,936. That's close to 118,080. So 234 gives 117,936, which is 48 less than 118,080. So 234 + (48/504) = 234 + (4/42) = 234 + (2/21) \u2248 234.095.\n\nSo p is approximately $234.095 per unit.\n\nLooking at the options, the choices are 226,230,240,260,280. So 234 is not an option, but 240 is the next higher option. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me recheck the initial steps.\n\nThe company's monthly cost is 420 * 110 = $46,200. That's correct.\n\nYearly cost is 46,200 *12 = $554,400. Correct.\n\nDesired profit is $626,400, so total revenue needs to be 554,400 +626,400 = $1,180,800. Correct.\n\nTotal units produced per year: 420/month *12 months = 5040 units. Correct.\n\nSo revenue is 5040 * p >=1,180,800.\n\nSo p >= 1,180,800 /5040.\n\nLet me compute that division again.\n\n5040 * 234 = 1,178, 160? Wait, 5040 *200=1,008,000. 5040*34= 171,360. 1,008,000+171,360=1,179,360. So 5040*234=1,179,360.\n\nBut we need 1,180,800, which is 1,180,800 -1,179,360 =1,440 more.\n\nSo 1,440 /5040 = 0.2857 approximately. So p=234 +0.2857\u2248234.2857.\n\nSo p must be at least approximately $234.29 per unit.\n\nLooking at the options, the next higher integer is 235, but the options don't have that. The options are 226,230,240, etc. So the next available option is 240. So the minimum price is 240.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me make sure that 230 is not enough. Let's compute what the profit would be if the price is 230.\n\nIf p=230, then monthly revenue is 420 *230 = let's calculate that.\n\n420 * 200 = 84,000.\n\n420 *30 =12,600.\n\nTotal =84,000 +12,600 =96,600 per month.\n\nYearly revenue: 96,600 *12 = 1,159,200.\n\nYearly cost is 554,400.\n\nProfit: 1,159,200 -554,400 = 604,800.\n\nBut 604,800 is less than the required 626,400. So 230 isn't enough.\n\nWhat about 240?\n\np=240.\n\nMonthly revenue:420 *240.\n\n420*200=84,000; 420*40=16,800. Total 100,800.\n\nYearly revenue:100,800 *12= 1,209,600.\n\nProfit:1,209,600 -554,400 =655,200.\n\nWhich is more than 626,400. So 240 is sufficient.\n\nBut wait, is there a lower price than 240 that meets the requirement?\n\nLooking at the options, 230 is too low. Next higher is 240. So the minimum price is 240.\n\nWait, but wait. The options don't include 234, so 240 is the next higher.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.\n\nWait, let me recheck the division.\n\n1,180,800 divided by 5040.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n5040 \u00d7 234 = 5040*(200 +34)=5040*200=1,008,000; 5040*34.\n\nCompute 5040 *30=151,200.\n\n5040*4=20,160.\n\nSo 151,200 +20,160=171,360.\n\nAdding to 1,008,000 gives 1,179,360.\n\nNow 1,180,800 -1,179,360 =1,440.\n\nSo 1,440 /5040 = 0.2857, as before. So 234.2857.\n\nSo to reach the exact amount, the price must be at least $234.29.\n\nBut the options don't have 234. The next available is 240, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the total revenue calculation.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me compute the required profit per unit.\n\nYearly desired profit is 626,400.\n\nTotal units per year:5040.\n\nSo profit per unit needed: 626,400 /5040.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n5040 \u00d7 124 = ?\n\nWait, perhaps 626,400 \u00f7 5040.\n\nCompute 5040 \u00d7 124 = 5040*(100+24)=504000 +120,960=624,960.\n\nWait, 5040 *124=624,960.\n\nBut 626,400 is 1,440 more than that. So 1,440 /5040 =0.2857.\n\nSo 124.2857 per unit. So total profit per unit is 124.2857.\n\nBut wait, no, wait. Profit per unit is selling price minus cost per unit.\n\nSo the cost per unit is 110, so selling price p must be 110 + (626,400 /5040).\n\nWait, that's a better approach.\n\nWait, profit per unit is (p - 110).\n\nTotal profit is (p -110) *5040 >=626,400.\n\nSo (p-110) >=626,400 /5040.\n\nCompute 626,400 \u00f75040.\n\nAgain, 5040 *124 = 624,960. 626,400 -624,960=1,440. So 1,440 /5040=0.2857.\n\nSo 626,400/5040=124.2857.\n\nSo p -110 >=124.2857.\n\nThus p >=110 +124.2857=234.2857.\n\nSo p must be at least $234.2857, which is approximately $234.29.\n\nLooking at the options, the next higher is 240. So the minimum price is 240, which is option C.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 234.29, but 240 is the first option higher than that. So the correct answer would be C)240.\n",

So 1,440 /5040 =0.2857.\n\nSo 124.2857 per unit. So total profit per unit is 124.2857.\n\nBut wait, no, wait. Profit per unit is selling price minus cost per unit.\n\nSo the cost per unit is 110, so selling price p must be 110 + (626,400 /5040).\n\nWait, that's a better approach.\n\nWait, profit per unit is (p - 110).\n\nTotal profit is (p -110) *5040 >=626,400.\n\nSo (p-110) >=626,400 /5040.\n\nCompute 626,400 \u00f75040.\n\nAgain, 5040 *124 = 624,960. 626,400 -624,960=1,440. So 1,440 /5040=0.2857.\n\nSo 626,400/5040=124.2857.\n\nSo p -110 >=124.2857.\n\nThus p >=110 +124.2857=234.2857.\n\nSo p must be at least $234.2857, which is approximately $234.29.\n\nLooking at the options, the next higher is 240. So the minimum price is 240, which is option C.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 234.29, but 240 is the first option higher than that. So the correct answer would be C)240.\n\n\nTo determine the minimum selling price per component that guarantees a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we start by calculating the total costs, revenue, and profit.\n\n1. **Monthly Cost**:  \n   The company produces 420 units per month at a cost of $110 per unit.  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Monthly Cost} = 420 \\times 110 = 46,200 \\, \\text{\\$}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Yearly Cost**:  \n   The yearly production cost is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Yearly Cost} = 46,200 \\times 12 = 554,400 \\, \\text{\\$}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Desired Yearly Profit**:  \n   The company aims for a profit of at least $626,400. Therefore, the total revenue must cover both the yearly cost and the desired profit:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Revenue} = \\text{Yearly Cost} + \\text{Desired Profit} = 554,400 + 626,400 = 1,180,800 \\, \\text{\\$}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Units Produced Yearly**:  \n   The company produces 420 units per month, so the total number of units produced in a year is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Units} = 420 \\times 12 = 5040 \\, \\text{units}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Minimum Selling Price per Unit**:  \n   Let \\( p \\) be the selling price per unit. The total revenue is given by:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Revenue} = 5040 \\times p\n   \\]  \n   To achieve the required revenue:  \n   \\[\n   5040 \\times p \\geq 1,180,800\n   \\]  \n   Solving for \\( p \\):  \n   \\[\n   p \\geq \\frac{1,180,800}{5040} \\approx 234.29 \\, \\text{\\$}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Checking the Options**:  \n   The calculated minimum price is approximately $234.29. Among the given options, the next higher price is $240. Testing $240:  \n   - Monthly Revenue:  \n     \\[\n     420 \\times 240 = 100,800 \\, \\text{\\$}\n     \\]  \n   - Yearly Revenue:  \n     \\[\n     100,800 \\times 12 = 1,209,600 \\, \\text{\\$}\n     \\]  \n   - Yearly Profit:  \n     \\[\n     1,209,600 - 554,400 = 655,200 \\, \\text{\\$}\n     \\]  \n     This exceeds the desired profit of $626,400.  \n\n   Testing $230:  \n   - Monthly Revenue:  \n     \\[\n     420 \\times 230 = 96,600 \\, \\text{\\$}\n     \\]  \n   - Yearly Revenue:  \n     \\[\n     96,600 \\times 12 = 1,159,200 \\, \\text{\\$}\n     \\]  \n   - Yearly Profit:  \n     \\[\n     1,159,200 - 554,400 = 604,800 \\, \\text{\\$}\n     \\]  \n     This is less than the desired profit, so $230 is insufficient.  \n\nThus, the minimum selling price per component to guarantee the desired profit is **$240**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out this problem about the company's selling price. Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nThe company produces 420 units every month. The cost per component is $110. They sell all of them by the end of each month. We need to find the minimum selling price per component that ensures their yearly profit is at least $626,400. \n\nHmm, so profit is revenue minus costs. Right. So first, I think I should calculate the total production cost per month and then per year. Then, the revenue they need each year to reach the desired profit. From there, I can find the required selling price per unit.\n\nLet me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the company makes 420 units each month. So per year, that's 420 multiplied by 12 months. Let me calculate that: 420 * 12. Hmm, 420 times 10 is 4200, and 420 times 2 is 840, so 4200 + 840 = 5040 units per year.\n\nThe production cost per component is $110. So the total production cost per year is 5040 units multiplied by $110. Let me compute that. 5040 * 110. Hmm, 5000*110 is 550,000, and 40*110 is 4,400. So 550,000 + 4,400 = 554,400. So the total cost each year is $554,400.\n\nThe desired profit is $626,400. So the total revenue they need is total cost plus profit. Wait, no, profit is revenue minus cost. So Revenue = Cost + Profit. So Revenue = 554,400 + 626,400 = let's add those. 554,400 + 626,400. Let me do that. 500,000 + 600,000 is 1,100,000. Then 54,400 + 26,400 is 80,800. So total is 1,180,800. So they need a revenue of $1,180,800 per year.\n\nNow, since they sell 420 units each month, which is 5040 units per year, the revenue per unit would be total revenue divided by number of units. So 1,180,800 divided by 5040. Let me compute that.\n\nWait, 5040 units. So 1,180,800 \u00f7 5040. Let me think about how to do this division. Maybe I can simplify it. Let's see, both numbers are divisible by 10, so 118,080 \u00f7 504.\n\nHmm, 504 times 200 is 100,800. Subtract that from 118,080: 118,080 - 100,800 = 17,280. Now, 504 * 34 is 504*30=15,120 and 504*4=2,016. So 15,120 + 2,016 = 17,136. That's close. So 34 is 17,136. The remainder is 17,280 - 17,136 = 144. 504 goes into 144 about 0.285 times (since 504*0.285 is about 144). So adding that, 200 + 34 = 234, and 0.285 gives 234.285. Wait, that's approximately 234.2857.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I can compute it more accurately. Let me try dividing 118080 by 504.\n\nAlternatively, let's see:\n\n5040 units per year.\n\n1,180,800 \u00f7 5040 = ?\n\nLet me see: 5040 * 234 = ?\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to note that 5040 = 504 * 10, so 1,180,800 \u00f7 5040 = (1,180,800 \u00f7 504) \u00f7 10.\n\nLet me compute 1,180,800 \u00f7 504 first.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 100: 11808 \u00f7 5.04. Hmm, maybe not helpful. Let me think of 504 as 504 = 56 * 9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 504 * 2340 equals 1,180,800? Let me check:\n\n504 * 2340 = ?\n\nWait, 504 * 2000 = 1,008,000.\n\n504 * 340 = ?\n\n504 * 300 = 151,200.\n\n504 *40 = 20,160.\n\nSo 151,200 +20,160= 171,360.\n\nSo 2000 +340=2340, so 1,008,000 + 171,360 = 1,179,360. Hmm, but we have 1,180,800. So the difference is 1,180,800 - 1,179,360 = 1,440.\n\nSo 504 * 2 = 1,008, so 1,440 /504 = 2.857 approx. So total is 2340 + 2.857 = 2342.857.\n\nWait, that's 2342.857, but wait, that can't be right because 5040 is 504*10, so maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try a different approach. Let me compute 1,180,800 divided by 5040.\n\n1,180,800 \u00f7 5040 = ?\n\nLet me simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 10: 118,080 \u00f7 504.\n\nNow, let's divide both by 24 to make it smaller. 118,080 \u00f724 = 4,920. 504 \u00f724=21.\n\nSo now it's 4,920 \u00f721. Hmm, 21 * 234 = 4,914. So 234 with a remainder of 6. So 234 + 6/21 = 234.2857.\n\nSo approximately $234.2857 per unit. But the options are all whole numbers, so the minimum price must be the next whole number above this, which is 235, but wait, looking at the options, the options are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280. Wait, none of these are 234 or 235. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nWait, let me go back and check my steps again.\n\nWait, the total production cost is 420 units/month * 12 months = 5040 units. Each unit costs $110, so 5040 *110 = 554,400. That seems right.\n\nDesired profit is $626,400. So revenue must be cost + profit: 554,400 +626,400= 1,180,800. Correct.\n\nThen, revenue per unit is 1,180,800 /5040. Let me compute that precisely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute 1,180,800 \u00f7 5040.\n\nLet me compute 5040 * 234 = ?\n\nAs before, 5040 * 200 = 1,008,000.\n\n5040 * 34 = let's compute 5040 *30 = 151,200 and 5040*4=20,160. So 151,200 +20,160=171,360. So 5040*234=1,008,000 +171,360=1,179,360.\n\nSo 1,180,800 -1,179,360=1,440. So 5040 * (234 + x) = 1,180,800.\n\nSo 5040*x = 1,440.\n\nSo x=1,440 /5040 = 0.2857. So 234.2857.\n\nSo approximately $234.29 per component. But the options don't have 234 or 235. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me check the initial numbers again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the desired revenue. Let me recheck that.\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost.\n\nWe need Profit >=626,400.\n\nSo Revenue = Cost + Profit.\n\nCost is 554,400. So Revenue = 554,400 +626,400 = 1,180,800. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute per month. Let me think: maybe the question is about monthly profit, but no, it says yearly profit. So I think my approach is correct.\n\nWait, but the options given are all higher than 234, which is the calculated value. The options are A)226, B)230, C)240, etc. So none of these are around 234. Hmm, but that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the total cost.\n\nWait, wait, 420 units per month at $110 each. So each month's cost is 420 *110. Let me compute that. 420 *110: 400*110=44,000, 20*110=2,200. So 44,000+2,200=46,200 per month. So per year, 46,200 *12 = 554,400. Correct.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum price, but perhaps I should consider that the price needs to be at least enough to cover the cost and make the desired profit. So the minimum price would be the calculated value, but since the options don't include it, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let me compute the required selling price per unit as (Total Cost + Desired Profit) / Number of Units.\n\nSo (554,400 +626,400) = 1,180,800. Divided by 5040 units.\n\nSo 1,180,800 /5040 = ?\n\nWait, 5040 goes into 1,180,800 how many times? Let me compute 5040 * 234 =1,179,360 as before. The difference is 1,180,800 -1,179,360=1,440. So 5040 * 0.2857=1,440. So 234.2857. So approximately $234.29 per unit. But the options don't have that. So maybe I did something wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about the price per unit, but perhaps the profit is per unit. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the total units. Let me recheck that. 420 per month *12 months is indeed 5040 units. So that's correct.\n\nWait, looking at the options, the closest higher number is C)240, which is higher than 234.29. So perhaps the correct answer is C)240. But wait, why is there a discrepancy? Did I miscalculate something?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should re-examine the initial problem statement. The problem says \"minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit [...] will be at least $626,400.\" So the revenue must be at least $626,400 plus the cost. Wait, no: profit is revenue minus cost. So if the profit is 626,400, then revenue is 554,400 + 626,400 =1,180,800. So that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the division again. Let me compute 1,180,800 \u00f75040.\n\nAnother way: 5040 = 504 *10. So 1,180,800 \u00f75040 = (1,180,800 \u00f7504) \u00f710.\n\nCompute 1,180,800 \u00f7504.\n\nLet me compute 504 * 2340 = 504 *2000=1,008,000; 504*340= 504*(300+40) = 151,200 +20,160=171,360. So 1,008,000 +171,360=1,179,360. Now, 1,180,800 -1,179,360=1,440.\n\nSo 504*2340 =1,179,360. 1,440 \u00f7504 = 2.857. So 2340 +2.857= 2342.857. Then, 2342.857 \u00f710 = 234.2857.\n\nSo that's correct. So the selling price needs to be at least approximately $234.29 per component. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the total revenue.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me re-express the problem. Maybe the profit is per unit. No, the question says total profit, so my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the required price per unit based on per month. Let me try that.\n\nTotal desired annual profit is $626,400. So per month, that's 626,400 \u00f712= 52,200 per month.\n\nEach month, the company sells 420 units. Their cost per month is 420 *110 =46,200.\n\nSo monthly profit is revenue (420 * price) - cost (46,200) >=52,200.\n\nSo 420 * price -46,200 >=52,200.\n\nSo 420 * price >= 52,200 +46,200 =98,400.\n\nSo price >=98,400 /420.\n\nCompute 98,400 \u00f7420.\n\nWell, 420 *234=98,280. 98,400-98,280=120. 120/420= 0.2857. So 234 +0.2857=234.2857. So same as before. So per unit price must be at least approximately $234.29. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I need to pick the next higher option. But the options are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nWait, but 234 is between 230 and 240. So the minimum price that guarantees the profit is 234.29, so the next higher whole dollar is 235. But since 235 is not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I should check if I miscalculated the required revenue.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute it again. Let's see: 420 units per month. So per month, revenue is 420 * price.\n\nProfit per month is revenue - cost per month. Cost per month is 420 *110 =46,200.\n\nSo for the profit to be at least 626,400 per year, which is 52,200 per month.\n\nSo 420 * price -46,200 >=52,200.\n\nSo 420 * price >= 98,400.\n\nSo price >= 98,400 /420.\n\nCompute 98,400 divided by 420.\n\nLet me compute 420 * 234 = 98,280.\n\n98,400 -98,280=120.\n\n120/420= 0.2857.\n\nSo 234.2857, which is approximately 234.29.\n\nBut the options don't have this, so perhaps I made a mistake in the question. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C)240, which is the next higher option. But wait, that would make the revenue higher than needed, but perhaps the question requires the minimum price. Wait, but 234.29 is the exact required price. So the minimum selling price would be 234.29, but since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct option is B)230, but wait, 230 is less than 234, which would not be enough. So that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the total profit calculation. Let me recheck:\n\nTotal cost per year: 420 *12 *110 =5040 *110=554,400.\n\nDesired profit: 626,400.\n\nSo total revenue needed:554,400 +626,400=1,180,800.\n\nDivide by 5040 units: 1,180,800 /5040=234.2857.\n\nSo that's correct. So the options don't include this value. But looking at the options, the closest higher is C)240. But why is that?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me re-read it.\n\nThe company sells all components by the end of each month. So, correct, so the calculation is correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the options are wrong, but that's not likely. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's not possible because it's a multiple-choice question.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the total units. Let me recheck: 420 per month *12=5040. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the profit is per unit, but that doesn't make sense. No, the question says yearly profit, so it's total.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the price as (Total cost + desired profit) / units. Which I did.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if 234.29 is indeed the correct value, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm calculating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C)240, which would be the next integer above 234.29, but that's not in the options. Wait, no, the options have B)230 and C)240. So 230 is lower than 234, so that wouldn't be enough. So the correct price must be higher than 234.29. So the next possible option is C)240. But 240 is higher than needed, but since it's the only higher option, perhaps that's the intended answer.\n\nWait, but wait, let's compute the profit if the price is 240 per unit.\n\nRevenue per year would be 5040 *240 = 1,209,600.\n\nTotal cost is 554,400. So profit is 1,209,600 -554,400 =655,200. Which is more than the desired 626,400. So yes, 240 would work. But is it the minimum? Because 234.29 would give exactly 626,400. But since 234.29 isn't an option, perhaps the next higher option is 240. But wait, the options include 230, which is lower than 234.29, so that can't be the correct answer. So perhaps the correct option is C)240, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me compute the price per unit again. 1,180,800 \u00f75040.\n\nWait, 5040 is 5040. So perhaps I can compute 1,180,800 \u00f75040 as follows.\n\nLet me write it as (1,180,800 \u00f7 10) \u00f7504 =118,080 \u00f7504.\n\nNow, 504 *234= 504*(200+34)=504*200=100,800; 504*34=17,136. So 100,800+17,136=117,936.\n\nSubtract that from 118,080: 118,080 -117,936=144.\n\nSo 144 \u00f7504= 0.2857. So total is 234.2857.\n\nSo 234.29, as before.\n\nHmm, so the options don't have this, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the price to be at least the cost plus desired profit per unit, but that doesn't make sense because the per-unit profit would vary based on the price.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is about gross profit, not net profit. But the question says profit is revenue minus production costs, which is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the question expects the price to be computed without considering that the company sells all components every month. But that's already accounted for.\n\nWait, perhaps the profit is per unit, but that's not what the question says. It says the profit is the total from sales minus costs.\n\nHmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me look at the options again. The options are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nSince 234.29 is the correct value, but it's not present, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B)230, but that would give a lower profit. Let me check.\n\nIf the price is 230, then annual revenue is 5040 *230=5040*200=1,008,000, plus 5040*30=151,200. So total is 1,008,000 +151,200=1,159,200.\n\nTotal cost is 554,400. So profit is 1,159,200 -554,400=604,800. But the desired profit is 626,400, so 230 is insufficient. So the correct price must be higher than 234.29.\n\nThe next option is C)240. Let me compute that.\n\n5040 *240 =1,209,600.\n\nProfit is 1,209,600 -554,400=655,200, which is more than 626,400. So 240 would work, but perhaps there's a lower option that's not listed. But since 234.29 isn't an option, the next possible is 240. So perhaps the correct answer is C)240.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me compute 5040 *234.2857=5040 *234 +5040*0.2857.\n\n5040*234=1,179,360.\n\n5040*0.2857\u22485040*(2/7)= approximately 5040*(0.2857)= approximately 1440. So 1,179,360 +1440=1,180,800. Correct.\n\nSo the correct price is approximately $234.29. Since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is C)240, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the total units. Let me recheck that. 420 units per month times 12 months is 5040 units. That's correct.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit stuck. But looking at the options, the only one that ensures the required profit is C)240. Because 230 gives insufficient profit, and 240 gives enough. So perhaps the correct answer is C)240.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the minimum selling price per component that guarantees a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we start by calculating the total production cost and the required revenue.\n\n### Step 1: Total Production Cost\nThe company produces 420 units per month at a cost of $110 per unit. Over 12 months, the total production cost is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Cost} = 420 \\, \\text{units/month} \\times 12 \\, \\text{months} \\times 110 \\, \\text{\\$/unit} = 5040 \\times 110 = 554,400 \\, \\text{\\$}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Total Revenue Required\nThe desired yearly profit is $626,400. Since profit is defined as revenue minus cost, the total revenue required is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Revenue} = \\text{Cost} + \\text{Profit} = 554,400 + 626,400 = 1,180,800 \\, \\text{\\$}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Selling Price per Unit\nThe company sells 420 units per month, which translates to:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Units per Year} = 420 \\, \\text{units/month} \\times 12 \\, \\text{months} = 5040 \\, \\text{units}.\n\\]\n\nTo find the minimum selling price per unit, divide the total revenue by the total number of units:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Price per Unit} = \\frac{\\text{Revenue}}{\\text{Total Units}} = \\frac{1,180,800}{5040} \\approx 234.29 \\, \\text{\\$}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Options\nThe calculated minimum price of $234.29 is not listed among the options. The options are:\n\n- **A) 226**\n- **B) 230**\n- **C) 240**\n- **D) 260**\n- **E) 280**\n\nTo ensure the desired profit, the selling price must be at least $234.29. Among the options, **240** is the smallest value that exceeds this amount. Checking the profit at $240 per unit:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Revenue} = 5040 \\times 240 = 1,209,600 \\, \\text{\\$}.\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Profit} = \\text{Revenue} - \\text{Cost} = 1,209,600 - 554,400 = 655,200 \\, \\text{\\$}.\n\\]\n\nThis profit exceeds the desired $626,400. Lower options, such as **230**, would result in insufficient profit:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Revenue at 230} = 5040 \\times 230 = 1,159,200 \\, \\text{\\$}.\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Profit at 230} = 1,159,200 - 554,400 = 604,800 \\, \\text{\\$}.\n\\]\n\nSince $604,800 is less than $626,400, **230** is insufficient. Therefore, the minimum selling price from the given options is **240**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**C) 240**",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out this problem about the company's selling price. Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nThe company produces 420 units every month. The cost per component is $110. They sell all of them by the end of each month. We need to find the minimum selling price per component that ensures their yearly profit is at least $626,400. \n\nHmm, so profit is revenue minus costs. Right. So first, I think I should calculate the total production cost per month and then per year. Then, the revenue they need each year to reach the desired profit. From there, I can find the required selling price per unit.\n\nLet me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the company makes 420 units each month. So per year, that's 420 multiplied by 12 months. Let me calculate that: 420 * 12. Hmm, 420 times 10 is 4200, and 420 times 2 is 840, so 4200 + 840 = 5040 units per year.\n\nThe production cost per component is $110. So the total production cost per year is 5040 units multiplied by $110. Let me compute that. 5040 * 110. Hmm, 5000*110 is 550,000, and 40*110 is 4,400. So 550,000 + 4,400 = 554,400. So the total cost each year is $554,400.\n\nThe desired profit is $626,400. So the total revenue they need is total cost plus profit. Wait, no, profit is revenue minus cost. So Revenue = Cost + Profit. So Revenue = 554,400 + 626,400 = let's add those. 554,400 + 626,400. Let me do that. 500,000 + 600,000 is 1,100,000. Then 54,400 + 26,400 is 80,800. So total is 1,180,800. So they need a revenue of $1,180,800 per year.\n\nNow, since they sell 420 units each month, which is 5040 units per year, the revenue per unit would be total revenue divided by number of units. So 1,180,800 divided by 5040. Let me compute that.\n\nWait, 5040 units. So 1,180,800 \u00f7 5040. Let me think about how to do this division. Maybe I can simplify it. Let's see, both numbers are divisible by 10, so 118,080 \u00f7 504.\n\nHmm, 504 times 200 is 100,800. Subtract that from 118,080: 118,080 - 100,800 = 17,280. Now, 504 * 34 is 504*30=15,120 and 504*4=2,016. So 15,120 + 2,016 = 17,136. That's close. So 34 is 17,136. The remainder is 17,280 - 17,136 = 144. 504 goes into 144 about 0.285 times (since 504*0.285 is about 144). So adding that, 200 + 34 = 234, and 0.285 gives 234.285. Wait, that's approximately 234.2857.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I can compute it more accurately. Let me try dividing 118080 by 504.\n\nAlternatively, let's see:\n\n5040 units per year.\n\n1,180,800 \u00f7 5040 = ?\n\nLet me see: 5040 * 234 = ?\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to note that 5040 = 504 * 10, so 1,180,800 \u00f7 5040 = (1,180,800 \u00f7 504) \u00f7 10.\n\nLet me compute 1,180,800 \u00f7 504 first.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 100: 11808 \u00f7 5.04. Hmm, maybe not helpful. Let me think of 504 as 504 = 56 * 9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 504 * 2340 equals 1,180,800? Let me check:\n\n504 * 2340 = ?\n\nWait, 504 * 2000 = 1,008,000.\n\n504 * 340 = ?\n\n504 * 300 = 151,200.\n\n504 *40 = 20,160.\n\nSo 151,200 +20,160= 171,360.\n\nSo 2000 +340=2340, so 1,008,000 + 171,360 = 1,179,360. Hmm, but we have 1,180,800. So the difference is 1,180,800 - 1,179,360 = 1,440.\n\nSo 504 * 2 = 1,008, so 1,440 /504 = 2.857 approx. So total is 2340 + 2.857 = 2342.857.\n\nWait, that's 2342.857, but wait, that can't be right because 5040 is 504*10, so maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try a different approach. Let me compute 1,180,800 divided by 5040.\n\n1,180,800 \u00f7 5040 = ?\n\nLet me simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 10: 118,080 \u00f7 504.\n\nNow, let's divide both by 24 to make it smaller. 118,080 \u00f724 = 4,920. 504 \u00f724=21.\n\nSo now it's 4,920 \u00f721. Hmm, 21 * 234 = 4,914. So 234 with a remainder of 6. So 234 + 6/21 = 234.2857.\n\nSo approximately $234.2857 per unit. But the options are all whole numbers, so the minimum price must be the next whole number above this, which is 235, but wait, looking at the options, the options are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280. Wait, none of these are 234 or 235. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nWait, let me go back and check my steps again.\n\nWait, the total production cost is 420 units/month * 12 months = 5040 units. Each unit costs $110, so 5040 *110 = 554,400. That seems right.\n\nDesired profit is $626,400. So revenue must be cost + profit: 554,400 +626,400= 1,180,800. Correct.\n\nThen, revenue per unit is 1,180,800 /5040. Let me compute that precisely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute 1,180,800 \u00f7 5040.\n\nLet me compute 5040 * 234 = ?\n\nAs before, 5040 * 200 = 1,008,000.\n\n5040 * 34 = let's compute 5040 *30 = 151,200 and 5040*4=20,160. So 151,200 +20,160=171,360. So 5040*234=1,008,000 +171,360=1,179,360.\n\nSo 1,180,800 -1,179,360=1,440. So 5040 * (234 + x) = 1,180,800.\n\nSo 5040*x = 1,440.\n\nSo x=1,440 /5040 = 0.2857. So 234.2857.\n\nSo approximately $234.29 per component. But the options don't have 234 or 235. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me check the initial numbers again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the desired revenue. Let me recheck that.\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost.\n\nWe need Profit >=626,400.\n\nSo Revenue = Cost + Profit.\n\nCost is 554,400. So Revenue = 554,400 +626,400 = 1,180,800. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute per month. Let me think: maybe the question is about monthly profit, but no, it says yearly profit. So I think my approach is correct.\n\nWait, but the options given are all higher than 234, which is the calculated value. The options are A)226, B)230, C)240, etc. So none of these are around 234. Hmm, but that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the total cost.\n\nWait, wait, 420 units per month at $110 each. So each month's cost is 420 *110. Let me compute that. 420 *110: 400*110=44,000, 20*110=2,200. So 44,000+2,200=46,200 per month. So per year, 46,200 *12 = 554,400. Correct.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum price, but perhaps I should consider that the price needs to be at least enough to cover the cost and make the desired profit. So the minimum price would be the calculated value, but since the options don't include it, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let me compute the required selling price per unit as (Total Cost + Desired Profit) / Number of Units.\n\nSo (554,400 +626,400) = 1,180,800. Divided by 5040 units.\n\nSo 1,180,800 /5040 = ?\n\nWait, 5040 goes into 1,180,800 how many times? Let me compute 5040 * 234 =1,179,360 as before. The difference is 1,180,800 -1,179,360=1,440. So 5040 * 0.2857=1,440. So 234.2857. So approximately $234.29 per unit. But the options don't have that. So maybe I did something wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about the price per unit, but perhaps the profit is per unit. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the total units. Let me recheck that. 420 per month *12 months is indeed 5040 units. So that's correct.\n\nWait, looking at the options, the closest higher number is C)240, which is higher than 234.29. So perhaps the correct answer is C)240. But wait, why is there a discrepancy? Did I miscalculate something?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should re-examine the initial problem statement. The problem says \"minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit [...] will be at least $626,400.\" So the revenue must be at least $626,400 plus the cost. Wait, no: profit is revenue minus cost. So if the profit is 626,400, then revenue is 554,400 + 626,400 =1,180,800. So that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the division again. Let me compute 1,180,800 \u00f75040.\n\nAnother way: 5040 = 504 *10. So 1,180,800 \u00f75040 = (1,180,800 \u00f7504) \u00f710.\n\nCompute 1,180,800 \u00f7504.\n\nLet me compute 504 * 2340 = 504 *2000=1,008,000; 504*340= 504*(300+40) = 151,200 +20,160=171,360. So 1,008,000 +171,360=1,179,360. Now, 1,180,800 -1,179,360=1,440.\n\nSo 504*2340 =1,179,360. 1,440 \u00f7504 = 2.857. So 2340 +2.857= 2342.857. Then, 2342.857 \u00f710 = 234.2857.\n\nSo that's correct. So the selling price needs to be at least approximately $234.29 per component. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the total revenue.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me re-express the problem. Maybe the profit is per unit. No, the question says total profit, so my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the required price per unit based on per month. Let me try that.\n\nTotal desired annual profit is $626,400. So per month, that's 626,400 \u00f712= 52,200 per month.\n\nEach month, the company sells 420 units. Their cost per month is 420 *110 =46,200.\n\nSo monthly profit is revenue (420 * price) - cost (46,200) >=52,200.\n\nSo 420 * price -46,200 >=52,200.\n\nSo 420 * price >= 52,200 +46,200 =98,400.\n\nSo price >=98,400 /420.\n\nCompute 98,400 \u00f7420.\n\nWell, 420 *234=98,280. 98,400-98,280=120. 120/420= 0.2857. So 234 +0.2857=234.2857. So same as before. So per unit price must be at least approximately $234.29. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I need to pick the next higher option. But the options are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nWait, but 234 is between 230 and 240. So the minimum price that guarantees the profit is 234.29, so the next higher whole dollar is 235. But since 235 is not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I should check if I miscalculated the required revenue.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute it again. Let's see: 420 units per month. So per month, revenue is 420 * price.\n\nProfit per month is revenue - cost per month. Cost per month is 420 *110 =46,200.\n\nSo for the profit to be at least 626,400 per year, which is 52,200 per month.\n\nSo 420 * price -46,200 >=52,200.\n\nSo 420 * price >= 98,400.\n\nSo price >= 98,400 /420.\n\nCompute 98,400 divided by 420.\n\nLet me compute 420 * 234 = 98,280.\n\n98,400 -98,280=120.\n\n120/420= 0.2857.\n\nSo 234.2857, which is approximately 234.29.\n\nBut the options don't have this, so perhaps I made a mistake in the question. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C)240, which is the next higher option. But wait, that would make the revenue higher than needed, but perhaps the question requires the minimum price. Wait, but 234.29 is the exact required price. So the minimum selling price would be 234.29, but since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct option is B)230, but wait, 230 is less than 234, which would not be enough. So that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the total profit calculation. Let me recheck:\n\nTotal cost per year: 420 *12 *110 =5040 *110=554,400.\n\nDesired profit: 626,400.\n\nSo total revenue needed:554,400 +626,400=1,180,800.\n\nDivide by 5040 units: 1,180,800 /5040=234.2857.\n\nSo that's correct. So the options don't include this value. But looking at the options, the closest higher is C)240. But why is that?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me re-read it.\n\nThe company sells all components by the end of each month. So, correct, so the calculation is correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the options are wrong, but that's not likely. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's not possible because it's a multiple-choice question.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the total units. Let me recheck: 420 per month *12=5040. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the profit is per unit, but that doesn't make sense. No, the question says yearly profit, so it's total.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the price as (Total cost + desired profit) / units. Which I did.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if 234.29 is indeed the correct value, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm calculating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C)240, which would be the next integer above 234.29, but that's not in the options. Wait, no, the options have B)230 and C)240. So 230 is lower than 234, so that wouldn't be enough. So the correct price must be higher than 234.29. So the next possible option is C)240. But 240 is higher than needed, but since it's the only higher option, perhaps that's the intended answer.\n\nWait, but wait, let's compute the profit if the price is 240 per unit.\n\nRevenue per year would be 5040 *240 = 1,209,600.\n\nTotal cost is 554,400. So profit is 1,209,600 -554,400 =655,200. Which is more than the desired 626,400. So yes, 240 would work. But is it the minimum? Because 234.29 would give exactly 626,400. But since 234.29 isn't an option, perhaps the next higher option is 240. But wait, the options include 230, which is lower than 234.29, so that can't be the correct answer. So perhaps the correct option is C)240, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me compute the price per unit again. 1,180,800 \u00f75040.\n\nWait, 5040 is 5040. So perhaps I can compute 1,180,800 \u00f75040 as follows.\n\nLet me write it as (1,180,800 \u00f7 10) \u00f7504 =118,080 \u00f7504.\n\nNow, 504 *234= 504*(200+34)=504*200=100,800; 504*34=17,136. So 100,800+17,136=117,936.\n\nSubtract that from 118,080: 118,080 -117,936=144.\n\nSo 144 \u00f7504= 0.2857. So total is 234.2857.\n\nSo 234.29, as before.\n\nHmm, so the options don't have this, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the price to be at least the cost plus desired profit per unit, but that doesn't make sense because the per-unit profit would vary based on the price.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is about gross profit, not net profit. But the question says profit is revenue minus production costs, which is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the question expects the price to be computed without considering that the company sells all components every month. But that's already accounted for.\n\nWait, perhaps the profit is per unit, but that's not what the question says. It says the profit is the total from sales minus costs.\n\nHmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me look at the options again. The options are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nSince 234.29 is the correct value, but it's not present, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B)230, but that would give a lower profit. Let me check.\n\nIf the price is 230, then annual revenue is 5040 *230=5040*200=1,008,000, plus 5040*30=151,200. So total is 1,008,000 +151,200=1,159,200.\n\nTotal cost is 554,400. So profit is 1,159,200 -554,400=604,800. But the desired profit is 626,400, so 230 is insufficient. So the correct price must be higher than 234.29.\n\nThe next option is C)240. Let me compute that.\n\n5040 *240 =1,209,600.\n\nProfit is 1,209,600 -554,400=655,200, which is more than 626,400. So 240 would work, but perhaps there's a lower option that's not listed. But since 234.29 isn't an option, the next possible is 240. So perhaps the correct answer is C)240.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me compute 5040 *234.2857=5040 *234 +5040*0.2857.\n\n5040*234=1,179,360.\n\n5040*0.2857\u22485040*(2/7)= approximately 5040*(0.2857)= approximately 1440. So 1,179,360 +1440=1,180,800. Correct.\n\nSo the correct price is approximately $234.29. Since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is C)240, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the total units. Let me recheck that. 420 units per month times 12 months is 5040 units. That's correct.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit stuck. But looking at the options, the only one that ensures the required profit is C)240. Because 230 gives insufficient profit, and 240 gives enough. So perhaps the correct answer is C)240.\n\n\nTo determine the minimum selling price per component that guarantees a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we start by calculating the total production cost and the required revenue.\n\n### Step 1: Total Production Cost\nThe company produces 420 units per month at a cost of $110 per unit. Over 12 months, the total production cost is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Cost} = 420 \\, \\text{units/month} \\times 12 \\, \\text{months} \\times 110 \\, \\text{\\$/unit} = 5040 \\times 110 = 554,400 \\, \\text{\\$}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Total Revenue Required\nThe desired yearly profit is $626,400. Since profit is defined as revenue minus cost, the total revenue required is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Revenue} = \\text{Cost} + \\text{Profit} = 554,400 + 626,400 = 1,180,800 \\, \\text{\\$}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Selling Price per Unit\nThe company sells 420 units per month, which translates to:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Units per Year} = 420 \\, \\text{units/month} \\times 12 \\, \\text{months} = 5040 \\, \\text{units}.\n\\]\n\nTo find the minimum selling price per unit, divide the total revenue by the total number of units:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Price per Unit} = \\frac{\\text{Revenue}}{\\text{Total Units}} = \\frac{1,180,800}{5040} \\approx 234.29 \\, \\text{\\$}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Options\nThe calculated minimum price of $234.29 is not listed among the options. The options are:\n\n- **A) 226**\n- **B) 230**\n- **C) 240**\n- **D) 260**\n- **E) 280**\n\nTo ensure the desired profit, the selling price must be at least $234.29. Among the options, **240** is the smallest value that exceeds this amount. Checking the profit at $240 per unit:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Revenue} = 5040 \\times 240 = 1,209,600 \\, \\text{\\$}.\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Profit} = \\text{Revenue} - \\text{Cost} = 1,209,600 - 554,400 = 655,200 \\, \\text{\\$}.\n\\]\n\nThis profit exceeds the desired $626,400. Lower options, such as **230**, would result in insufficient profit:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Revenue at 230} = 5040 \\times 230 = 1,159,200 \\, \\text{\\$}.\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Profit at 230} = 1,159,200 - 554,400 = 604,800 \\, \\text{\\$}.\n\\]\n\nSince $604,800 is less than $626,400, **230** is insufficient. Therefore, the minimum selling price from the given options is **240**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**C) 240**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a company producing computer components. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is asking for the minimum selling price per component to guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400. \n\nAlright, let's break down what I know. The company produces 420 units every month. So, in a year, that's 12 months multiplied by 420 units. Let me calculate that. 12 times 420... 420*10 is 4200, 420*2 is 840, so 4200+840=5040 units per year. Right, 5040 units total.\n\nEach component costs them $110 to produce. So the total production cost per year would be 5040 units multiplied by $110. Let me compute that. 5040 * 110. Hmm, 5040 * 100 is 504,000, and 5040 *10 is 50,400. Adding those together gives 554,400. So the total cost is $554,400 per year.\n\nThe company wants a yearly profit of at least $626,400. Profit is calculated as revenue minus costs. So, the revenue needed is profit plus costs. So, $626,400 (desired profit) plus $554,400 (costs) equals $1,180,800. That's the total revenue they need to make in a year.\n\nRevenue is the selling price per unit multiplied by the number of units sold. So, the formula is Revenue = Price * Quantity. We can rearrange that to find the required price: Price = Revenue / Quantity. \n\nPlugging in the numbers, the required price per unit is $1,180,800 divided by 5040 units. Let me compute that. Hmm, 5040 into 1,180,800. \n\nWait, maybe it's easier to divide step by step. Let's see: 5040 goes into 1,180,800 how many times? Let me think. 5040 * 200 is 1,008,000. Subtract that from 1,180,800: 1,180,800 - 1,008,000 = 172,800. Now, how much is 5040 into 172,800? Let's see, 5040 * 30 is 151,200. Subtract that: 172,800 -151,200 = 21,600. 5040 *4 is 20,160. Wait, 5040 *4.5 is 22,680, which is more than 21,600. Wait, maybe 4 times. So 21,600 divided by 5040: 5040 *4 is 20,160. So 21,600 - 20,160 = 1,440. So that's 4.2857... Hmm, maybe I should just do the division properly.\n\nWait, 5040 * 234 is what? Let me calculate 5040 * 200 = 1,008,000. 5040 *30=151,200. 5040*4=20,160. So adding those: 200+30=230, 230+4=234. 1,008,000 +151,200=1,159,200. +20,160 = 1,179,360. Hmm, but that's 5040 *234=1,179,360. Our target is 1,180,800. The difference is 1,180,800 -1,179,360 = 1,440. So 1,440 is how much more we need. 1,440 divided by 5040 is 1,440 /5040 = 0.2857. So the total price is 234 + 0.2857 \u2248 234.2857 dollars per unit.\n\nWait, but that's approximately $234.29. But looking at the options, the closest higher option would be B)230, which is lower than that. Wait, wait, no. Wait the options are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280. Wait, 234.29 is between 230 and 240. So the minimum price that guarantees the profit would be the next higher value above 234.29. So the options are B is 230, which is lower than 234.29, so it's insufficient. The next higher option is C)240. So the minimum price per component is $240.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I compute that correctly? Because maybe I messed up the division. Let me try another approach. Let me compute 1,180,800 divided by 5040. \n\nAlternatively, let's divide both numerator and denominator by 1000 to make it easier. 1,180,800 /5040 = (1180.8)/(5.04). Let me compute that. Hmm, 5.04 times 234 is about 1179.36. So 5.04 *234 = 1179.36. The difference is 1180.8 -1179.36=1.44. So 1.44 divided by 5.04 is 0.2857. So again, 234.2857. So about $234.29.\n\nBut the options are in whole numbers. So the price must be at least $234.29 per unit. Since the options don't include 234 or 235, the next higher option is C)240. So the minimum price is 240 to meet or exceed the required profit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should double-check my calculations. Let me compute the required revenue again. Profit is 626,400. Costs are 110 per unit, 420 per month, 12 months. So 420 *110=46,200 per month. 46,200 *12 = 554,400. Profit is 626,400, so revenue is 554,400 + 626,400 = 1,180,800. That's correct.\n\nRevenue is price times 5040. So price is 1,180,800 /5040. Let me compute 5040 * 234: 5040 *200=1,008,000. 5040*30=151,200. 5040*4=20,160. So 200+30+4=234. 1,008,000+151,200=1,159,200 +20,160=1,179,360. So 5040*234=1,179,360. The target is 1,180,800. So 1,180,800 -1,179,360=1,440. So how many more units? 1,440 divided by 5040 per unit is 1,440/5040 = 0.2857. So the price per unit is 234 +0.2857 \u2248234.2857.\n\nSo the price must be at least about $234.29. The options are 226, 230, 240, etc. So 230 is lower than 234.29, which would give insufficient revenue. So to meet the required revenue, the price must be at least $234.29, so the next possible option is 240. So the correct answer is C)240.\n",
