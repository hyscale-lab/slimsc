      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Sachin's batting average in the IPL season. Hmm, I need to find out how many matches he played in total. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, let me start by recalling what a batting average means. Batting average is calculated by dividing the total runs scored by the number of times the batsman has been dismissed, right? Or wait, no, wait. Actually, the batting average is total runs divided by the number of innings they've batted. Oh wait, no, wait again. Because in cricket, a dismissal is a 'wicket', but batting average is runs per dismissal. Or is it runs per innings? I'm a bit confused. Wait, no, I think it's runs per dismissal. Because if a batsman hasn't been dismissed yet, that's not counted as an innings. So for example, if he's not out, it's not counted as an innings for the purpose of average. So the batting average is total runs divided by the number of times he's been dismissed (out). So if he's not out, it doesn't count towards his average.\n\nWait, but in some cases, like in Test cricket, a player can have not out innings, but for the average, only the times he was out are considered. So, the batting average formula is: (Total Runs)/(Number of Dismissals).\n\nBut wait, I'm not 100% sure. Another thought: sometimes, the batting average is calculated as total runs divided by the number of innings, regardless of whether they were dismissed or not. So if the batsman hasn't been dismissed, it's still considered an inning. Hmm, which one is correct here? Because that changes the problem entirely.\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement: \"In IPL season, Sachin current batting average is 51.\" So he's played some number of matches, and his average is 51. Then in the finals, he scores 78 runs, and his average goes up to 54. So I think the problem is assuming that a match is an inning, regardless of whether he was out or not. Because otherwise, if the average is based on dismissals, and he was not out in the finals, then his dismissals wouldn't have increased, but his runs would have. So let's clarify this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each match he plays counts as an inning, regardless of whether he was dismissed or not. So the average is total runs divided by the number of innings. That makes sense because, for example, if a batsman has 100 runs in 10 innings, the average is 10. So I think that's the right approach here.\n\nSo let me proceed under the assumption that batting average is (total runs)/(number of innings played). So each match he plays is an inning, whether he's out or not.\n\nSo, let me set up the variables.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet x be the number of innings (matches) he played before the finals.\n\nHis average before the finals is 51. So total runs before finals would be 51 * x.\n\nIn the finals, he plays one more inning (so x + 1 innings total) and scores 78 runs. His new average is 54.\n\nSo the total runs after finals is 51x + 78.\n\nThe new average is (51x +78) / (x +1) =54.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n(51x +78)/(x+1) =54\n\nLet me solve this equation for x.\n\nMultiply both sides by (x+1):\n\n51x +78 =54(x+1)\n\nExpand the right side:\n\n51x +78 =54x +54\n\nNow, bring like terms together. Let's subtract 51x from both sides:\n\n78 =3x +54\n\nSubtract 54 from both sides:\n\n24=3x\n\nSo x=8.\n\nSo before the finals, he played 8 innings. After the finals, it's 9 innings.\n\nSo the total number of matches is 9.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 9. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to be sure.\n\n51x +78 =54x +54\n\nSubtract 51x from both sides:\n\n78=3x +54\n\nSubtract 54:\n\n24=3x \u2192 x=8.\n\nYes, so x is 8, and total matches are 8 +1=9. So option C is correct.\n",

Oh right, it's the total runs scored divided by the number of matches, or maybe the number of innings? Wait, in cricket, a batting average is usually total runs divided by the number of times you've batted (i.e., the number of innings).

Or perhaps each innings is a half-match? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, but in IPL, each match is a full match where each team bats once. So if Sachin is batting, he has an innings per match.

So his total runs become 51n + 78.\n\nThe number of matches now is n + 1.\n\nHis new average is 54. So the total runs divided by (n + 1) equals 54.\n\nSo the equation would be:\n\n(51n + 78) / (n + 1) = 54\n\nLet me solve this equation.\n\nMultiply both sides by (n+1):\n\n51n + 78 = 54(n + 1)\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n51n +78 = 54n +54\n\nNow, subtract 51n from both sides:\n\n78 = 3n +54\n\nSubtract 54 from both sides:\n\n24 = 3n\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\nn =8\n\nWait, so n is 8. That means before the finals, he played 8 matches. Then he played one more in the finals, so total matches are 8 + 1=9.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 9. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to be sure.\n\nSo initial average 51, n=8: total runs 51*8=408.\n\nAfter finals, runs are 408 +78=486.\n\nNumber of matches is 9.\n\n486 /9=54, which matches the new average. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the total number of matches is 9.\n\n\nTo determine the total number of matches Sachin played in the IPL season, let's define the variables and set up the equation based on the given information:\n\n1. Let the number of matches played before the finals be \\( n \\).\n2. Sachin's batting average before the finals is 51, so his total runs scored in these matches is \\( 51n \\).\n3. In the finals, he scores 78 runs, so his total runs after the finals is \\( 51n + 78 \\).\n4. After the finals, the total number of matches played is \\( n + 1 \\), and his new batting average is 54.\n\nUsing the formula for batting average:\n\\[\n\\text{Batting Average} = \\frac{\\text{Total Runs}}{\\text{Number of Matches}}\n\\]\nwe set up the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{51n + 78}{n + 1} = 54\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( n \\):\n\\[\n51n + 78 = 54(n + 1)\n\\]\n\\[\n51n + 78 = 54n + 54\n\\]\n\\[\n78 - 54 = 54n - 51n\n\\]\n\\[\n24 = 3n\n\\]\n\\[\nn = 8\n\\]\n\nThis means Sachin played 8 matches before the finals. Adding the 1 match in the finals, the total number of matches played is \\( 8 + 1 = 9 \\).\n\nFinally, verifying the calculation:\n- Total runs before finals: \\( 51 \\times 8 = 408 \\)\n- Total runs after finals: \\( 408 + 78 = 486 \\)\n- Total matches after finals: \\( 9 \\)\n- New batting average: \\( \\frac{486}{9} = 54 \\), which matches the given information.\n\nThus, the total number of matches played by Sachin in the season is **9**.\n\nAnswer: C",

Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nAlright, the problem says that Sachin's current batting average is 51. Then in the finals, he scores 78 runs, and his average goes up to 54. I need to find out how many matches he played in total this season. The options are from 6 to 11, so not too many possibilities, but I need to calculate it properly.\n\nWait, batting average is calculated as total runs divided by the number of matches, right? So, average = total runs / number of matches. \n\nLet me denote the number of matches he played before the finals as 'n'. So, his total runs before the finals would be 51 multiplied by n, because average is 51. \n\nThen, in the finals, he scores 78 runs. So, his new total runs become (51n + 78). And the number of matches now is n + 1, since he played one more match. \n\nThe new average is given as 54. So, I can set up an equation:\n\n(51n + 78) / (n + 1) = 54\n\nOkay, now I need to solve this equation for n. Let's rearrange it.\n\nMultiply both sides by (n + 1) to get rid of the denominator:\n51n + 78 = 54(n + 1)\n\nExpanding the right side:\n51n + 78 = 54n + 54\n\nNow, let's bring like terms together. Subtract 51n from both sides:\n78 = 3n + 54\n\nThen, subtract 54 from both sides:\n24 = 3n\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\nn = 8\n\nWait, so n is 8. But wait, n is the number of matches before the finals. So the total matches after adding the finals is n + 1 = 9. \n\nSo, the total number of matches he played is 9. Looking at the options, option C is 9. \n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nOriginal average: 51, so runs = 51*8 = 408. After scoring 78, total runs are 486. Number of matches is 9. 486 divided by 9 is 54. Yep, that's correct. \n\nSo the answer should be option C, 9.\n",
