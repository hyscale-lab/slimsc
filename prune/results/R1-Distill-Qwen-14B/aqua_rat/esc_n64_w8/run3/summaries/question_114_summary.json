      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a fan blade. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.\n\nThe question says: A point on the edge of a fan blade is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center. I need to find the distance traveled by this point after 30 seconds when the fan runs at 300 revolutions per minute. The options are A to E, and I have to choose the correct one.\n\nWait, okay, so the point is moving in a circular path. So the distance traveled would be the circumference of the circle multiplied by the number of revolutions, right? Because each revolution moves the point along the circumference once.\n\nFirst, let's get the details straight. The radius is 10 cm. So the circumference is 2 * pi * r. Plugging in 10 cm, that's 2 * pi * 10 = 20 pi cm per revolution. Got that.\n\nNext, the fan's speed is 300 revolutions per minute. But the time given is 30 seconds. Oh wait, I need to convert the time into minutes because the rate is per minute. So 30 seconds is half a minute, right? So 30 / 60 = 0.5 minutes.\n\nSo the number of revolutions in 30 seconds would be 300 rev/min * 0.5 min = 150 revolutions. Wait, wait. Let me double-check that. 300 times 0.5 is indeed 150. So 150 full turns.\n\nEach revolution is 20 pi cm, so the total distance is 150 * 20 pi. Let me calculate that: 150 times 20 is 3000. So 3000 pi centimeters. Hmm, looking at the options, option D is 3000 pi. So that would be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Did I convert the time correctly? Yes, 30 seconds is 0.5 minutes. The rate is 300 per minute, so 300 * 0.5 is 150 revs. Each rev is 20 pi cm, so 150 * 20 pi = 3000 pi cm. Yep, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the total distance another way. Like, angular velocity and time. Oh, but maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, I could find the linear speed and multiply by time.\n\nLinear speed v is equal to the radius multiplied by the angular speed in radians per second. Wait, the angular speed is 300 revs per minute, which is 300/60 = 5 revs per second. Each revolution is 2 pi radians, so 5 * 2 pi = 10 pi radians per second. So angular speed omega is 10 pi rad/s.\n\nThen linear speed v = r * omega. r is 10 cm, so v = 10 cm * 10 pi rad/s = 100 pi cm/s.\n\nThen distance is speed multiplied by time, so 100 pi * 30 seconds. 100 *30 is 3000, so 3000 pi cm. Yep, same answer. So that confirms it.\n\nSo the correct answer is D) 3000 pi.\n",

The setup is that the fan is 10 centimeters from the center, and I need to find out the distance traveled by that point after 30 seconds when the fan is running at 300 revolutions per minute. The options are all multiples of pi, so I think the answer involves circles and circumference.\n\nWait, right, when something rotates, each point on the edge travels along a circular path. The circumference of that circle is 2 * pi * r, where r is the radius. Oh, right, here the radius is 10 cm because it's on the edge. So the circumference would be 2 * pi * 10 cm, which is 20 pi cm. That's how far the point travels in one full revolution.\n\nBut the fan isn't just making one revolution; it's spinning at 300 revolutions per minute. So I need to find out how many revolutions happen in 30 seconds. Oh wait, 300 revs per minute is the same as 300 revs in 60 seconds. So in 30 seconds, it's half of that time, right? So 300 divided by 2 is 150. So there are 150 revolutions in 30 seconds.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me think again. 300 revolutions per minute means in one minute (60 seconds), it does 300 revs. So in 30 seconds, which is half a minute, it does 300 / 2 = 150 revs. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo each revolution is 20 pi cm, so total distance is 150 revs multiplied by 20 pi cm per rev. Let's calculate that. 150 * 20 is 3000, so 3000 pi cm. Hmm, looking at the options, option D is 3000 pi. So that's the answer, right?\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I miss any step? Let me go through it again. The point is moving in a circle with radius 10 cm. Circumference is 2 pi r, so 20 pi cm. The fan's speed is 300 RPM. Time is 30 seconds. So time per minute is 60 seconds, so 30 seconds is 0.5 minutes. So the number of revolutions is 300 * 0.5 = 150 revs. Multiply by the circumference: 150 * 20 pi = 3000 pi cm. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of angular velocity. Angular velocity omega is 300 rev per minute. To get it into rev per second, that's 300/60 = 5 rev per second. Then, in 30 seconds, it's 5 * 30 = 150 revs again. Same as before.\n\nSo the total distance is number of revs times circumference. So 150 * 20 pi = 3000 pi. So the answer should be D) 3000pi.\n",

The options are given in terms of pi, so I think the answer will involve some circular motion calculations.\n\nHmm, right. So the key here is to find the distance the point travels. I remember that the distance traveled by a point moving in a circular path is related to the circumference of the circle and the number of revolutions it makes. Oh wait, right, the formula is probably something like distance equals number of revolutions multiplied by the circumference of the circle.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how many revolutions the fan makes in 30 seconds. Oh wait, the fan's speed is given in revolutions per minute, but the time is in seconds. So I need to convert the time to minutes or adjust the revolutions per minute accordingly.\n\nLet me think. 30 seconds is half a minute because a minute is 60 seconds. So 30 seconds is 0.5 minutes. Now, if the fan runs at 300 revolutions per minute, then in 0.5 minutes, it would complete 300 * 0.5 revolutions. Let me calculate that: 300 * 0.5 is 150 revolutions. So the point on the edge makes 150 full circles in 30 seconds.\n\nNext, each revolution would have the point travel a distance equal to the circumference of the circle it's moving along. The radius of the circle is given as 10 centimeters. The formula for circumference is 2 * pi * radius. So plugging in the radius, that's 2 * pi * 10 cm. Which is 20 pi cm per revolution.\n\nNow, to find the total distance, I multiply the number of revolutions by the circumference. So 150 revolutions times 20 pi cm per revolution. Let me compute that: 150 * 20 is 3000, so 3000 pi cm.\n\nWait a second, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check the steps. \n\n1. Convert 30 seconds to minutes: 30/60 = 0.5 minutes.\n2. Calculate revolutions in 0.5 minutes: 300 * 0.5 = 150 revs.\n3. Circumference: 2 * pi * 10 = 20 pi cm.\n4. Total distance: 150 * 20 pi = 3000 pi cm.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3000 pi. So that's the answer. \n\nWait, but wait another thing. Did I mix up any units? Let me check again. The time was 30 seconds, which is 0.5 minutes. Correct. The fan's speed is 300 rev per minute. So 300 * 0.5 is 150 revs. Correct. The radius is 10 cm, so circumference is 20 pi. Multiply 150 by 20 pi gives 3000 pi cm. Yep, that looks right. So the correct option is D.\n",

So that's the radius, right? The fan runs at 300 revolutions per minute. Oh wait, but the time given is 30 seconds, which is half a minute. So I need to find how much distance the point travels in that time.\n\nWait, distance traveled. Oh, that's the circumference times the number of revolutions, right? Because each revolution, the point moves along the circumference. So yeah, distance is like the arc length for each revolution multiplied by the number of revolutions.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the number of revolutions the fan makes in 30 seconds. The fan's speed is 300 revolutions per minute. Since 30 seconds is half a minute, the number of revolutions would be 300 * (30/60). Let me do that math. 30 divided by 60 is 0.5, so 300 * 0.5 is 150 revolutions in 30 seconds.\n\nNow, each revolution, the point moves a distance equal to the circumference of the circle. The circumference is 2 * pi * radius. The radius here is 10 cm.

Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: find the angular velocity in radians per second. 300 rev per minute is 300 * 2 pi radians per minute. So 600 pi rad/min. Which is 600 pi / 60 = 10 pi rad/s. Angular velocity is 10 pi rad/s.\n\nThe time is 30 seconds, so total angle is 10 pi * 30 = 300 pi radians. The distance is radius times angle (in radians), so 10 cm * 300 pi = 3000 pi cm. Oh, same answer. So yeah, definitely option D.\n",

Since the time given is 30 seconds, we convert this to minutes:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time in minutes} = \\frac{30}{60} = 0.5 \\, \\text{minutes}.\n\\]\n\nThe total number of revolutions in 30 seconds is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Revolutions} = 300 \\, \\text{rev/min} \\times 0.5 \\, \\text{min} = 150 \\, \\text{rev}.\n\\]\n\nThe total distance traveled by the point is the number of revolutions multiplied by the circumference of the circle:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = 150 \\, \\text{rev} \\times 20 \\pi \\, \\text{cm/rev} = 3000 \\pi \\, \\text{cm}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the distance traveled by the point after 30 seconds is \\( 3000 \\pi \\, \\text{cm} \\). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:\n\n**D) 3000\\pi**\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a fan blade and calculating how far a point on the edge travels. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when something moves in a circular path, the distance it travels depends on the circumference and the number of revolutions. \n\nSo the question says the point is on the edge of the fan blade, which means it's moving in a circle with radius 10 cm. Oh right, the circumference is 2\u03c0r, so that would be 2 * \u03c0 * 10 cm. Let me calculate that. 2 times 10 is 20, so the circumference is 20\u03c0 cm. Got that.\n\nNext, the fan runs at 300 revolutions per minute. Wait, but the time given is 30 seconds. Oh, I need to convert the revolutions per minute to revolutions per second or vice versa. Let me think. Since 300 revolutions happen in 60 seconds, that's 300/60 = 5 revolutions per second. Or wait, maybe I should find out how many revolutions happen in 30 seconds. Hmm, either way works.\n\nSo in 30 seconds, how many revolutions? Well, if it's 300 per minute, then per second it's 5. Multiply that by 30 seconds: 5 * 30 = 150 revolutions. Oh yeah, that's right. So 150 revolutions in 30 seconds.\n\nEach revolution is one full circumference, so the distance is number of revolutions multiplied by circumference. So 150 * 20\u03c0 cm. Let me compute that. 150 times 20 is 3000, so 3000\u03c0 cm. Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 3000pi. So that would be the answer, right?\n\nWait a second, let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the angular speed in radians per second and then multiply by time and radius. Hmm. Angular speed \u03c9 is 300 rev per minute. Since one revolution is 2\u03c0 radians, that's 300 * 2\u03c0 radians per minute. Oh wait, but 300 rev/min is 300 * 2\u03c0 rad/min. Then, convert to radians per second: 300 * 2\u03c0 / 60 = 10\u03c0 rad/s. So \u03c9 = 10\u03c0 rad/s.\n\nThe formula for linear speed is v = r\u03c9. Here, r is 10 cm, so v = 10 cm * 10\u03c0 rad/s = 100\u03c0 cm/s. Then, distance is speed multiplied by time: 100\u03c0 cm/s * 30 s = 3000\u03c0 cm. Yep, same answer. So the correct option is D.\n",
