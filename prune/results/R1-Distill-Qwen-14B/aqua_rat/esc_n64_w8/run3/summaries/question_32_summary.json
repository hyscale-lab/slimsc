      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a map scale, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that on a map, the road from Town F to Town G is 20 inches long. The scale is 1/4 inch representing 10 miles. I need to find the actual distance in miles. Hmm, scales can be a bit tricky, but I think I remember that it's about converting the map distance to real distance using the given ratio.\n\nWait, so the scale is 1/4 inch equals 10 miles. So that means for every quarter inch on the map, it's 10 miles in real life. I guess I should find out how many miles one inch on the map corresponds to. Let me think. If 1/4 inch is 10 miles, then one inch would be four times that, right? Because 1 divided by 1/4 is 4. So 10 miles times 4 is 40 miles per inch. Oh, okay, so each inch equals 40 miles.\n\nNow, the distance between the towns is 20 inches on the map. So I multiply 20 inches by the scale to get the actual distance. That would be 20 times 40 miles per inch. Let me calculate that. 20 * 40 is 800. So that's 800 miles.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because sometimes these problems can be tricky. Another way to approach it is to set up a proportion. The scale is 1/4 inch to 10 miles. So for x miles, 20 inches would correspond. So (1/4)/10 = 20/x. Wait, no, maybe I should set it up as (1/4 inch) / (10 miles) = (20 inches) / (x miles). Hmm, cross-multiplying gives (1/4)*x = 10 * 20. So x = (10 * 20) / (1/4) )? Wait, let me see. Alternatively, the scale is 10 miles per 1/4 inch, so the conversion factor is 10 miles per 0.25 inches. To find the actual distance, multiply the map distance by (10 / 0.25). \n\nSo 20 inches * (10 miles / 0.25 inches). Let me compute that. 10 divided by 0.25 is 40, so 20 * 40 = 800 miles. Yep, same answer. So the actual distance should be 800 miles.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 800, so that should be the correct answer. The other options are way bigger or smaller, so I think I'm confident that A is right.\n",

Oh wait, and the scale is given as 1/4 inch representing 10 miles. Hmm, I need to find the actual distance between the towns in miles.\n\nWait, let me think.

Then, it tells me that 1/4 inch on this map represents an actual distance of 10 miles. I need to find the actual distance in miles between the two towns.\n\nHmm, right. So this is a scale conversion problem. Maps usually have a scale that tells you how real distances are represented on the map. The scale here is 1/4 inch equals 10 miles.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a map scale, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe problem states that on a map, the distance from Town F to Town G is measured as 20 inches. Then, it tells me that 1/4 inch on this map represents an actual distance of 10 miles. I need to find the actual distance in miles between the two towns.\n\nHmm, right. So this is a scale conversion problem. Maps usually have a scale that tells you how real distances are represented on the map. The scale here is 1/4 inch equals 10 miles. So for every 1/4 inch on the map, it's 10 miles in real life.\n\nWait, so if 1/4 inch is 10 miles, I can find out how many miles one inch represents, and then multiply that by the number of inches (20) to get the actual distance. That makes sense.\n\nLet me break it down. First, find out how many miles one inch equals. Since 1/4 inch is 10 miles, then one inch would be 10 miles multiplied by 4, right? Because 1 divided by 1/4 is 4. So 10 miles *4 =40 miles per inch.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait a second, if 1/4 inch is 10 miles, then 1 inch is 4 times that. So 10 *4 =40 miles per inch. Yeah, that's right.\n\nSo each inch on the map stands for 40 miles in real life. Got it. Now, the distance on the map is 20 inches. So to find the actual distance, I multiply 20 inches by 40 miles per inch. Let me compute that.\n\n20 * 40 = 800. So 800 miles. That seems like a long distance, but maybe it's a big map or a long road.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 800, so that should be the answer. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the scale.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: how many 1/4 inches are in 20 inches? Let's see, 1/4 inch is 0.25 inches. So 20 divided by 0.25 equals 80. So there are 80 segments of 1/4 inch in 20 inches. Each of those segments is 10 miles, so 80 *10 = 800 miles. Yep, same answer.\n\nSo both methods give me 800 miles. So the correct answer should be A)800.\n\n\nTo determine the actual distance between Town F and Town G, we start by understanding the map scale.

I need to find the actual distance between the towns.\n\nWait, so the map scale is 1/4 inch equals 10 miles. That means for every quarter inch on the map, it's 10 miles in reality.
