      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out when buying a membership becomes worth it compared to renting without one. Let me break this down. \n\nWithout the membership, each DVD costs $4.00. If I buy the membership, I pay a flat fee of $7.00 per month, and each DVD then costs $2.00. I guess the question is asking how many DVDs I need to rent so that the total cost with the membership is less than or equal to the cost without.\n\nHmm, let's think about the costs. Without the membership, the cost for renting 'x' DVDs is 4x dollars. With the membership, it's 7 + 2x dollars because I have to pay the $7.00 membership fee plus $2.00 per DVD.\n\nI need to find the smallest 'x' where 7 + 2x is less than or equal to 4x. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, because the membership is worth it if the total cost is lower. So I need to find when 7 + 2x < 4x.\n\nLet me write that equation: 7 + 2x < 4x.\n\nSubtracting 2x from both sides gives 7 < 2x. Then dividing both sides by 2, I get 7/2 < x, which is 3.5 < x. Since you can't rent half a DVD, x has to be at least 4. So the minimum number of DVDs is 4. Let me double-check.\n\nIf I rent 3 DVDs without membership: 3*4=12 dollars. With membership: 7 + 3*2 = 13. So that's more expensive. Not worth it. \n\nRenting 4 without: 16 dollars. With membership: 7 + 4*2=15. 15 is less than 16, so it's worth it at 4.\n\nSo the answer should be D)4.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem about renting DVDs and memberships. Hmm, let's read it again carefully. The question is asking me to find the minimum number of DVDs I need to rent so that buying a membership is worth it. \n\nSo, the options without a membership: each DVD is $4.00. If I buy a membership for $7.00 a month, each rental only costs $2.00. I guess the idea is to compare the total cost with and without the membership and find when the membership becomes more economical.\n\nLet me think. Without the membership, for each DVD I rent, it's $4. So if I rent 'x' number of DVDs, the total cost would be 4x dollars.\n\nWith the membership, I pay a flat fee of $7 plus $2 per DVD. So the total cost would be 7 + 2x.\n\nI need to find the smallest 'x' where the membership option is cheaper or equal. So, I should set up an inequality where 4x is greater than or equal to 7 + 2x. Because that's when buying the membership becomes worth it\u2014when the cost without membership is at least as much as the cost with.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me rephrase that. I want to find when the membership option is cheaper. So when 4x > 7 + 2x. Because if 4x is more than the other option, then the membership is better.\n\nSo, let's solve that inequality.\n\n4x > 7 + 2x\n\nSubtract 2x from both sides:\n\n2x > 7\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nx > 3.5\n\nHmm, x has to be more than 3.5. But x is the number of DVDs, which has to be a whole number. So the next integer after 3.5 is 4. So you'd need to rent at least 4 DVDs for the membership to be worth it.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's calculate the total costs for 3 and 4 rentals.\n\nWithout membership:\n3 DVDs: 3 *4 = $12\nWith membership: 7 + 3*2 = 7+6=13. So without is cheaper. So 3 is not enough.\n\n4 DVDs:\nWithout: 4*4=16\nWith:7 + 4*2=7+8=15. So 15 is less than 16, so membership is better. So at 4, it's worth it.\n\nSo the minimum number is 4. So looking at the options, D is 4.\n\n\nTo determine the minimum number of DVDs needed to make purchasing a membership worth it, we compare the total costs of renting without and with a membership. \n\nWithout a membership, each DVD costs $4.00, so the total cost for renting \\( x \\) DVDs is \\( 4x \\). With a membership, the cost is a flat fee of $7.00 per month plus $2.00 per DVD, giving a total cost of \\( 7 + 2x \\). We need to find the smallest \\( x \\) where the membership option is cheaper, i.e., \\( 4x > 7 + 2x \\).\n\nSolving the inequality:\n\\[\n4x > 7 + 2x\n\\]\nSubtract \\( 2x \\) from both sides:\n\\[\n2x > 7\n\\]\nDivide by 2:\n\\[\nx > 3.5\n\\]\nSince \\( x \\) must be an integer, the smallest value of \\( x \\) is 4. \n\nTo verify:\n- For \\( x = 3 \\): Without membership, the cost is \\( 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\). With membership, the cost is \\( 7 + 3 \\times 2 = 13 \\). Membership is not cheaper.\n- For \\( x = 4 \\): Without membership, the cost is \\( 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\). With membership, the cost is \\( 7 + 4 \\times 2 = 15 \\). Membership is cheaper.\n\nThus, the minimum number of DVDs needed is 4.\n\nAnswer: D",

Without a membership, each DVD costs $4.00. But if I buy a membership for $7.00 a month, each rental drops to $2.00. I need to find out when the total cost with the membership becomes less than or equal to not having the membership. \n\nWait, no, actually, I think I should find when the total cost with membership is cheaper than paying without. So the point where the total cost of paying for the membership plus the per DVD cost is less than paying without the membership for the same number of DVDs.\n\nLet me write this out. Let's say I rent 'x' number of DVDs. \n\nWithout membership: total cost = 4x dollars.\nWith membership: total cost = 7 + 2x dollars.\n\nWe need to find the smallest x where 7 + 2x < 4x.\n\nHmm, solving for x.

So x needs to be at least 4. Because 3.5 isn't possible, so the next whole number is 4. \n\nWait, let me check. If x is 3, what happens? Without membership, 3*4=12. With membership, 7+3*2=7+6=13. So 13 is more than 12, so not worth it. \n\nIf x is 4: Without, 4*4=16. With, 7+4*2=7+8=15. 15 is less than 16. So yes, at 4 rentals, membership is better. \n\nSo the minimum number is 4.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about renting DVDs and deciding whether to get a membership or not. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nHmm, the question says that without a membership, each DVD costs $4.00. But if I buy a membership for $7.00 a month, each rental only costs $2.00. I need to find out the minimum number of DVDs I have to rent each month to make the membership worth it.\n\nWait, right. So the idea is to figure out when the total cost without the membership becomes more than the cost with the membership. So I should set up an equation where the cost without membership is greater than the cost with membership.\n\nLet me denote the number of DVDs as x. So without membership, the cost is 4x dollars. With membership, it's 7 dollars for the membership plus 2x dollars for each rental. So the total with membership is 7 + 2x.\n\nI need to find the smallest x where 4x > 7 + 2x. Because that's when buying the membership becomes more economical.\n\nSo let me write that inequality: 4x > 7 + 2x.\n\nTo solve for x, I can subtract 2x from both sides. That gives 2x > 7.\n\nThen, divide both sides by 2: x > 3.5.\n\nBut x has to be a whole number because you can't rent half a DVD. So the smallest integer greater than 3.5 is 4. So you'd need to rent at least 4 DVDs for the membership to be worth it.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If x is 4, the cost without membership is 4*4=16. With membership, it's 7 + (4*2)=7+8=15. So 16>15, which means buying membership is better. But wait, the question is asking when it's worth it to purchase the membership. So when is the membership cheaper?\n\nWait, the wording says \"make it worth it to purchase the membership.\" So when is the total cost with membership less than without.\n\nSo the inequality should be 4x > 7 + 2x. Because if 4x is greater than the other option, then the other option (membership) is cheaper.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. If without membership, the cost is higher, then the membership is worth it. So when 4x > 7 + 2x, then 7+2x is cheaper. So the condition is 4x > 7 + 2x.\n\nWhich gives x>3.5, so x=4.\n\nSo the minimum number is 4. Looking at the options, D is 4. So the answer should be D.\n",
