The question is asking for P(A/B), which I think is the probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred. Or wait, sometimes notation can be tricky. Oh right, P(A/B) is read as \"probability of A given B,\" right?\n\nSo the problem states that A and B are independent events. Oh, right, independent events mean that the occurrence of one doesn't affect the probability of the other.

Because for independent events, the joint probability is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nSo let me plug in the numbers. P(A and B) = 0.2 * 0.8 = 0.16.
