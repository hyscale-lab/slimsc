      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to figure out what the units digit of 9^3 minus 7 is. Hmm, units digit... right, that's the last digit of the number. So I don't need to calculate the whole thing, just focus on the last digit of each part.\n\nFirst, let's compute 9^3. 9 multiplied by itself three times. Wait, 9 times 9 is 81, right? Then 81 multiplied by 9. Let me do that step by step. 80 times 9 is 720, and 1 times 9 is 9, so 720 +9 is 729. So 9^3 is 729. The units digit here is 9 because 729 ends with a 9.\n\nNow, subtract 7 from 729. So 729 minus 7. Let's see, 729 minus 1 is 728, minus another 6 would be 722. Wait, no, wait a second. 729 minus 7 is 722? Let me check that again. 729 minus 7: the 9 minus 7 is 2, so the units digit is 2. So the units digit of 729 -7 is 2.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a quicker way. I remember that for units digits, sometimes you can just look at the units digits of each number involved. So 9^3 has a units digit of 9, as I found earlier. Then subtracting 7: 9 minus 7 is 2. So the units digit is 2. So the answer should be 2, which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should double-check the calculations. Let me recalculate 9^3. 9*9=81, 81*9: 80*9=720, 1*9=9, so 720+9=729. Yes, that's correct. So 729-7 is 722. The last digit is 2.\n\nAnother approach: when dealing with exponents, the units digit of powers often cycles in a pattern. For 9, the units digit cycles every 2 exponents. 9^1 is 9, 9^2 is 81 (units digit 1), 9^3 would be 9 again (since 1*9=9). So 9^3 has units digit 9. Subtract 7, so 9-7=2. Yep, same result.\n\nSo the options are A)1, B)3, C)5, D)2, E)4. So the correct answer is D)2.\n",

Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find the units digit of 9 cubed. I remember that when calculating units digits, especially for exponents, there's a pattern that repeats. For 9, the powers cycle in a certain way. Let me try to calculate 9 to the power of 3.\n\n9^1 is 9, so the units digit is 9. 9^2 is 81, so the units digit is 1. Then 9^3 would be 9 multiplied by 9^2, which is 81. So 9 * 81. Wait, what's 9 times 81? Let me do that multiplication. 9 * 80 is 720, and 9 * 1 is 9. So 720 + 9 is 729. So 9^3 is 729. Therefore, the units digit is 9, right? Because 729 ends with a 9.\n\nNow, the problem is 9^3 minus 7. So that's 729 minus 7. Let me subtract that. 729 minus 7 is 722. So the units digit of 722 is 2.
