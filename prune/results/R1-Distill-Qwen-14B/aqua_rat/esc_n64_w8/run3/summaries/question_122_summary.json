      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a cyclist traveling at a certain speed, and I need to figure out how long it takes to go a specific distance. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nThe question says the cyclist is going at 12 miles per hour. I need to find out how many minutes it takes to travel 48 miles. Hmm, right. So I remember that time is equal to distance divided by speed. Yeah, the formula is time = distance / speed.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. The distance is 48 miles, and the speed is 12 mph. So time in hours would be 48 divided by 12. Let me calculate that. 48 divided by 12 is 4. So that's four hours. But wait, the question asks for the time in minutes, not hours. Oh right, I need to convert hours to minutes.\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so I multiply 4 hours by 60 minutes per hour. 4 times 60 is 240 minutes. Okay, so that's 240 minutes. Let me check the options to see which one matches.\n\nLooking at the options: A)1, B)240, C)30, D)60, E)120. So option B is 240. That must be the correct answer.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me double-check the calculation. 12 mph means every hour covers 12 miles. So in four hours, 12*4=48 miles. Yep, that's correct. And converting four hours to minutes, 4*60=240. Yeah, that all adds up. So I'm confident the answer is B)240.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a cyclist traveling at a certain speed, and I need to figure out how many minutes it takes to go 48 miles. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says the cyclist's speed is 12 miles per hour. I remember that speed is distance divided by time, right? So the formula is speed = distance / time. I think I can rearrange this formula to solve for time. So time equals distance divided by speed.\n\nWait, yeah, that makes sense. So time = distance / speed. The distance here is 48 miles, and the speed is 12 mph. So plugging in the numbers, time equals 48 divided by 12. Let me calculate that: 48 \u00f7 12 is 4. Oh, so that gives me 4 hours. But wait, the question asks for the time in minutes, not hours. Right, I need to convert hours to minutes.\n\nI know that 1 hour is 60 minutes, so if the time is 4 hours, that's 4 times 60. Let me do that multiplication: 4 * 60 equals 240 minutes. So the answer should be 240 minutes.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 240. So I think that's the correct choice. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Did I correctly convert hours to minutes? Yes, 4 hours times 60 is 240 minutes. And the initial calculation was right: 48 divided by 12 is definitely 4. So yeah, I'm confident that B is the right answer.\n\n\nThe cyclist's speed is 12 miles per hour. To find the time it takes to travel 48 miles, use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time (hours)} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{48 \\, \\text{miles}}{12 \\, \\text{mph}} = 4 \\, \\text{hours}.\n\\]\n\nConvert hours to minutes by multiplying by 60:\n\n\\[\n4 \\, \\text{hours} \\times 60 \\, \\text{minutes/hour} = 240 \\, \\text{minutes}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is **B) 240**.\n\nAnswer: B",
