      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where Silu and Meenu are talking, and I need to figure out Meenu's weight based on what she said. Let me try to break it down.\n\nSo, Silu says she weighs 51 kg, but that's probably just extra information because the question is about Meenu. Meenu doesn't want to say her weight directly but gives a clue: \"I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight.\" Hmm, that sounds a bit confusing. Let me parse that.\n\nWait, so Meenu is saying her weight equals 29 kg plus half of her weight. Oh wait, that can't be right because if her weight is X, then X = 29 + (X/2). So that's an equation I can solve.\n\nLet me write that down: X = 29 + (X/2). I need to solve for X. How do I do that? Well, subtract (X/2) from both sides to get all X terms on one side. So, X - (X/2) = 29. That simplifies to (X/2) = 29 because X is the same as 2X/2, so 2X/2 - X/2 is X/2.\n\nSo if X/2 equals 29, then X is 29 multiplied by 2. So X = 58. That would make Meenu's weight 58 kg. Wait, but looking at the options, D is 58. So is that the answer?\n\nWait a second, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake. So if Meenu's weight is 58 kg, then half of that is 29. Adding 29 (from the problem) gives 58. Oh wait, that's right. Because 29 + (58/2) equals 29 +29 which is 58. So yes, that adds up.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't misread the problem. Meenu says, \"I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight.\" So, she's not saying she weighs 29 plus half of Silu's weight, but half of her own. So yeah, that's why I set up the equation as X = 29 + X/2.\n\nSo solving that gives X=58. So the answer should be D)58.\n",

Instead, she said, \"I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight.\" Hmm, that's a bit tricky, but I think I can work through it.\n\nLet me break this down. Meenu is saying her weight equals 29 kg plus half of her own weight. So, maybe I can set up an equation here. Let's let Meenu's weight be represented by W. So according to her statement, W equals 29 plus half of W. So the equation would be W = 29 + (1/2)W.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Now, I need to solve for W. Let me rearrange this equation. If I subtract (1/2)W from both sides, I get W - (1/2)W = 29. Simplifying the left side, W minus half W is the same as half W. So, (1/2)W = 29.\n\nTo find W, I can multiply both sides by 2.

Oh, that adds up correctly. So she's saying her weight is 29 plus half of her weight, which is 29. So 29 + 29 is 58. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but the options are A)12, B)28, C)27, D)58, E)91.
