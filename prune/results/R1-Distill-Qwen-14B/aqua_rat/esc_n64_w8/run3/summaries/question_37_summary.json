      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about the shopkeeper selling a watch and discounts affecting his profit. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.\n\nThe problem says that when the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, he makes a certain profit. But when he gives a 7% discount, his profit is Rs. 15 less. I need to find the marked price of the watch. The options are given, so maybe I can work through it step by step.\n\nWait, I remember that marked price is the original price before any discount. So when the shopkeeper gives a discount, the selling price becomes less than the marked price. The difference in profit when the discount changes is Rs. 15.\n\nLet me think about the variables involved. Let\u2019s denote the marked price as M. The cost price for the shopkeeper is probably constant, right? Because regardless of the discount, his cost remains the same. So the profit depends on the selling price, which is affected by the discount.\n\nWhen the discount is 5%, the selling price (SP1) is M minus 5% of M, which is M*(1 - 0.05) = 0.95M.\n\nSimilarly, when the discount is 7%, the selling price (SP2) is M*(1 - 0.07) = 0.93M.\n\nThe profit in the first case is SP1 minus cost price (C). In the second case, the profit is SP2 minus C. The difference between these two profits is Rs. 15, and since he earns less when the discount is higher, SP2 is lower, so profit is lower by 15.\n\nSo, (SP1 - C) - (SP2 - C) = 15.\n\nSimplify that: SP1 - SP2 = 15.\n\nBecause the C cancels out. So substituting the SP values:\n\n0.95M - 0.93M = 15.\n\nThat's 0.02M = 15.\n\nSo, M = 15 / 0.02.\n\nHmm, 15 divided by 0.02 is the same as 15 * 50, which is 750. So M is 750.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, D is 750. So that must be the answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps. So marked price is M. The two selling prices are 0.95M and 0.93M. The difference is 0.02M, which is 15. So 0.02M=15 \u2192 M=750. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me think again: The problem says when he gives a 7% discount, he earns Rs.15 less as profit. So the profit difference is SP1 - SP2 = 15, because profit is SP minus cost. So yeah, the equation is correct.\n\nSo the marked price is 750, which is option D.\n",

But if he gives a 7% discount instead, his profit is Rs. 15 less. And I need to find the marked price of the watch.\n\nWait, what do I remember about discounts and profit? Oh right, the selling price after discount affects the profit. Profit is usually calculated based on the cost price, but the marked price is the original price before any discount.\n\nSo, the marked price is the price before any discount is applied. Let's denote the marked price as M. \n\nWhen the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, the selling price becomes 95% of M. So that's 0.95*M. Similarly, a 7% discount would make the selling price 93% of M, which is 0.93*M.\n\nThe difference between these two selling prices is Rs. 15. Because when he gives a bigger discount (7%), he makes Rs. 15 less profit. So, the difference between the two selling prices is 0.95M minus 0.93M, which equals 0.02M. And that's equal to 15.\n\nSo I can set up the equation: 0.02M = 15. Solving for M would give me M = 15 / 0.02. Let me calculate that. 15 divided by 0.02 is the same as 15 * 50, which is 750. So M is Rs. 750.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because profit depends on the cost price, right? Oh wait, maybe I'm missing something. Because the profit would be selling price minus cost price. So when the discount is 5%, profit is S1 - C, and when discount is 7%, it's S2 - C. The difference between S1 and S2 is 15, so S1 - S2 = 15.\n\nWhich is what I did earlier, right? Because S1 is 0.95M, S2 is 0.93M. So S1 - S2 = 0.02M =15. So M=750. So the marked price is 750. Looking at the options, option D is 750.\n\nWait, but another approach: Maybe the cost price is fixed. Let me think. Suppose the cost price is C. Then when he sells at 5% discount, his selling price is 0.95M, which gives a profit of 0.95M - C. When he sells at 7% discount, profit is 0.93M - C. The difference between these two profits is 15.\n\nSo (0.95M - C) - (0.93M - C) = 15. Simplifying, 0.95M - C -0.93M + C = 15 \u2192 0.02M =15. So same result. So M is 750. So the answer is D.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is 750, which matches. So that should be correct.\n",

The problem says that when the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, he makes a certain profit. But if he gives a 7% discount, his profit is Rs. 15 less. I need to find the marked price of the watch.\n\nWait, marked price is the price tag on the product, right? So the selling price when he gives a discount is lower than the marked price. Let me think about the variables involved here.\n\nLet me denote the marked price as M. So when the discount is 5%, the selling price would be M minus 5% of M, which is M*(1 - 0.05) = 0.95M. Similarly, a 7% discount would make the selling price 0.93M.\n\nNow, the problem says that with a 7% discount, the profit is Rs.15 less. So, profit is usually calculated as selling price minus cost price. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention the cost price. Oh, maybe the profit difference is due to the difference in selling prices. Because when he gives a larger discount, his selling price is lower, so profit is lower by Rs.15.\n\nWait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me rephrase. Let's assume that the cost price is fixed, regardless of the discount. So when he sells at 5% discount, his selling price is higher than when he sells at 7% discount. The difference in selling prices is Rs.15, which is the difference in profit. Because the cost price doesn't change, the difference in selling price directly translates to the difference in profit.\n\nSo, the difference between 5% discount selling price and 7% discount selling price is Rs.15. So, 0.95M - 0.93M = 0.02M. And that equals Rs.15.\n\nSo, 0.02M = 15. Then M = 15 / 0.02. Let's calculate that. 15 divided by 0.02 is the same as 15 multiplied by 50, which is 750. So M is 750.\n\nWait, looking at the options, option D is Rs.750. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If M is 750, then 5% discount is 37.5, so selling price is 712.5. 7% discount is 52.5, so selling price is 697.5. The difference between 712.5 and 697.5 is indeed 15. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the marked price is 750, which is option D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a shopkeeper selling a watch. Hmm, let's read it carefully. The problem says that when the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, he makes a certain profit. But if he gives a 7% discount, his profit is Rs. 15 less. I need to find the marked price of the watch.\n\nWait, marked price is the price tag on the product, right? So the selling price when he gives a discount is lower than the marked price. Let me think about the variables involved here.\n\nLet me denote the marked price as M. So when the discount is 5%, the selling price would be M minus 5% of M, which is M*(1 - 0.05) = 0.95M. Similarly, a 7% discount would make the selling price 0.93M.\n\nNow, the problem says that with a 7% discount, the profit is Rs.15 less. So, profit is usually calculated as selling price minus cost price. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention the cost price. Oh, maybe the profit difference is due to the difference in selling prices. Because when he gives a larger discount, his selling price is lower, so profit is lower by Rs.15.\n\nWait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me rephrase. Let's assume that the cost price is fixed, regardless of the discount. So when he sells at 5% discount, his selling price is higher than when he sells at 7% discount. The difference in selling prices is Rs.15, which is the difference in profit. Because the cost price doesn't change, the difference in selling price directly translates to the difference in profit.\n\nSo, the difference between 5% discount selling price and 7% discount selling price is Rs.15. So, 0.95M - 0.93M = 0.02M. And that equals Rs.15.\n\nSo, 0.02M = 15. Then M = 15 / 0.02. Let's calculate that. 15 divided by 0.02 is the same as 15 multiplied by 50, which is 750. So M is 750.\n\nWait, looking at the options, option D is Rs.750. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If M is 750, then 5% discount is 37.5, so selling price is 712.5. 7% discount is 52.5, so selling price is 697.5. The difference between 712.5 and 697.5 is indeed 15. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the marked price is 750, which is option D.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let the marked price of the watch be \\( M \\). When the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, the selling price is \\( 0.95M \\). When the discount is increased to 7%, the selling price becomes \\( 0.93M \\). The difference in selling prices due to the increased discount is Rs. 15. Therefore:\n\n\\[\n0.95M - 0.93M = 0.02M\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\( 0.02M = 15 \\), solving for \\( M \\):\n\n\\[\nM = \\frac{15}{0.02} = 750\n\\]\n\nThus, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 750. Verifying, if \\( M = 750 \\), the selling prices are \\( 0.95 \\times 750 = 712.5 \\) (for a 5% discount) and \\( 0.93 \\times 750 = 697.5 \\) (for a 7% discount). The difference is \\( 712.5 - 697.5 = 15 \\), which matches the problem's condition.\n\nAnswer: D",

The question says that when the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, he makes a certain profit. But if he gives a 7% discount instead, his profit is Rs. 15 less than before. We need to find the marked price of the watch.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. So, the marked price is the original price, right? And the shopkeeper is giving discounts on that marked price. So when he gives a 5% discount, the selling price is 95% of the marked price. And when he gives a 7% discount, it's 93% of the marked price.\n\nBut how does this affect his profit? Profit is calculated based on the cost price, I think. Oh, right, profit is selling price minus cost price. So if the profit when giving a 5% discount is higher than when giving 7%, the difference is Rs. 15. Because giving a bigger discount (7%) reduces the profit by Rs. 15 compared to the 5% discount case.\n\nLet me try to structure this. Let\u2019s denote the marked price as MP. The cost price is probably constant in both scenarios, so let's say the cost price is CP.\n\nWhen the discount is 5%, the selling price (SP1) is MP - 5% of MP, which is 0.95 * MP. The profit in this case would be SP1 - CP.\n\nWhen the discount is 7%, the selling price (SP2) is 0.93 * MP. The profit here is SP2 - CP.\n\nAccording to the problem, the profit when giving a 7% discount is Rs. 15 less than when giving 5% discount. So, the difference between the two profits is 15. So:\n\nProfit at 5% discount - Profit at 7% discount = 15.\n\nWhich translates to:\n\n(0.95*MP - CP) - (0.93*MP - CP) = 15.\n\nWait, the CP terms will cancel out. Let me compute that.\n\n0.95 MP - CP - 0.93 MP + CP = 15.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(0.95 - 0.93) * MP = 15.\n\n0.02 * MP = 15.\n\nSo, MP = 15 / 0.02.\n\n15 divided by 0.02 is 750. So the marked price is Rs. 750.\n\nLooking at the options, D is Rs. 750. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps. Did I miss anything? The cost price is the same in both cases, so when I subtract the two profits, the CP does indeed cancel out. So the difference between the two selling prices is 0.02 * MP, which equals 15.

Hmm, the problem says that when the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, he makes a certain profit. But if he gives a 7% discount, his profit is Rs. 15 less. I need to find the marked price of the watch.\n\nWait, right, the marked price is the original price before any discounts. So let's denote that as M. The cost price for the shopkeeper is probably something else, but I'm not sure yet. Oh wait, I think profit is calculated based on the cost price. So maybe I can relate the two scenarios where the discounts are different.\n\nLet me think. When he gives a 5% discount, the selling price is 95% of M, which is 0.95 * M. Similarly, a 7% discount would make the selling price 93% of M, so 0.93 * M.\n\nThe difference in profit between these two scenarios is Rs.15. So, the profit when he sells at 5% discount minus the profit when he sells at 7% discount equals 15. But wait, actually, I think it's the other way around because a higher discount would lead to lower profit. So when he gives a higher discount (7%), his profit is Rs.15 less than when he gave 5%. So Profit at 5% discount minus Profit at 7% discount = 15.\n\nBut how do I express profit? Profit is Selling Price minus Cost Price. So I need to know the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as C. \n\nSo, Profit1 (5% discount) = 0.95M - C.\n\nProfit2 (7% discount) = 0.93M - C.\n\nThe difference Profit1 - Profit2 = 15.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n(0.95M - C) - (0.93M - C) = 15.\n\nWait, let me compute that. The C terms would cancel out. 0.95M - C -0.93M + C = 15. So (0.95M - 0.93M) =15. That simplifies to 0.02M =15.\n\nOh, so 0.02 times M equals 15. So M is 15 divided by 0.02. Let me calculate that. 15 / 0.02 is the same as 15 * 50, because 0.02 is 1/50. So 15 *50=750. So M is 750.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So the difference in selling prices is 0.95M -0.93M =0.02M. And this difference is equal to the difference in profit, which is 15. So 0.02M=15, M=750. So the marked price is Rs.750. Looking at the options, option D is 750. So that's the answer.\n\nWait a second, but let me think again. Because profit is based on cost price. So if the selling price is higher when discount is 5%, profit is higher. But in both cases, the cost price remains the same, right? So the difference in profit is indeed the difference in selling price. So yes, 0.02M=15, M=750. So option D.\n",

The cost price for the shopkeeper is probably something else, but I'm not sure yet. Oh wait, I think profit is calculated based on the cost price. So maybe I can relate the two scenarios where the discounts are different.\n\nLet me think. When he gives a 5% discount, the selling price is 95% of M, which is 0.95 * M. Similarly, a 7% discount would make the selling price 93% of M, so 0.93 * M.\n\nThe difference in profit between these two scenarios is Rs.15. So, the profit when he sells at 5% discount minus the profit when he sells at 7% discount equals 15. But wait, actually, I think it's the other way around because a higher discount would lead to lower profit. So when he gives a higher discount (7%), his profit is Rs.15 less than when he gave 5%. So Profit at 5% discount minus Profit at 7% discount = 15.\n\nBut how do I express profit? Profit is Selling Price minus Cost Price. So I need to know the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as C. \n\nSo, Profit1 (5% discount) = 0.95M - C.\n\nProfit2 (7% discount) = 0.93M - C.\n\nThe difference Profit1 - Profit2 = 15.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n(0.95M - C) - (0.93M - C) = 15.\n\nWait, let me compute that. The C terms would cancel out. 0.95M - C -0.93M + C = 15. So (0.95M - 0.93M) =15. That simplifies to 0.02M =15.\n\nOh, so 0.02 times M equals 15. So M is 15 divided by 0.02. Let me calculate that. 15 / 0.02 is the same as 15 * 50, because 0.02 is 1/50. So 15 *50=750. So M is 750.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So the difference in selling prices is 0.95M -0.93M =0.02M. And this difference is equal to the difference in profit, which is 15. So 0.02M=15, M=750. So the marked price is Rs.750. Looking at the options, option D is 750. So that's the answer.\n\nWait a second, but let me think again. Because profit is based on cost price. So if the selling price is higher when discount is 5%, profit is higher. But in both cases, the cost price remains the same, right? So the difference in profit is indeed the difference in selling price. So yes, 0.02M=15, M=750. So option D.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the marked price of a watch, denoted as \\( M \\), given that a 5% discount yields a certain profit, while a 7% discount reduces the profit by Rs. 15. \n\nLet the cost price be \\( C \\). When a 5% discount is applied, the selling price is \\( 0.95M \\), and the profit is \\( 0.95M - C \\). Similarly, with a 7% discount, the selling price is \\( 0.93M \\), and the profit is \\( 0.93M - C \\). The difference in profit between the two scenarios is given as Rs. 15. \n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n(0.95M - C) - (0.93M - C) = 15\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n0.95M - 0.93M = 15 \\implies 0.02M = 15\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( M \\):\n\n\\[\nM = \\frac{15}{0.02} = 750\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 750. Among the options provided, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: D**",

The difference in his profit between these two scenarios is Rs. 15.\n\nBut wait, how does the profit come into play here? Profit is calculated based on the cost price, right? Oh, right, but we don't know the cost price. Hmm, that might complicate things. Wait, maybe the problem is assuming that the cost price is the same in both cases, which it should be because it's the same watch. So the cost price is fixed, and the selling price affects the profit.\n\nLet me think. Let's denote the marked price as M. Then, when he sells it at a 5% discount, the selling price is 0.95*M. When he sells it at 7% discount, it's 0.93*M. The difference between these two selling prices is 0.95M - 0.93M = 0.02M. And this difference is equal to Rs. 15 less profit, so the profit drops by 15.\n\nWait, so the difference in selling prices is Rs. 15. Because when he sells at a higher discount (7%), his selling price is lower, so profit is lower. The difference in selling prices would directly affect the profit. So 0.02M = 15. Then M would be 15 / 0.02, which is 750. So the marked price is Rs. 750. Looking at the options, option D is 750.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because the profit is calculated as selling price minus cost price. Let me think: Let's say cost price is C. Then, profit at 5% discount is 0.95M - C. At 7% discount, profit is 0.93M - C. The difference in profit is (0.95M - C) - (0.93M - C) = 0.02M. And this is given as 15. So 0.02M =15 \u2192 M=750. Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be D, Rs. 750.\n",
