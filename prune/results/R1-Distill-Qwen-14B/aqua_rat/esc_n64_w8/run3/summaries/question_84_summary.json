      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangle. Then this rectangle is cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. The question is asking for the perimeter of the original square cloth.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. So first, it's a square. Let's say the original square has sides of length 's' feet. So each side is 's', and the area is s squared.\n\nThen, they trim 4 feet off one edge. Wait, which edge? Oh, wait, it just says one edge, so I think it's one side that's trimmed by 4 feet. So, if the original square was s by s, trimming one edge by 4 feet would make the rectangle s by (s-4), right? Because one side is reduced by 4.\n\nSo the rectangle's dimensions are s feet by (s - 4) feet. Then this rectangle is cut diagonally in half, making two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. So, the area of the rectangle must be twice that, which is 140 square feet.\n\nWait, right. Because each triangle is half of the rectangle. So the area of the rectangle is 70 * 2 = 140. So I can set up an equation: s * (s -4) = 140.\n\nLet me write that equation out: s(s -4) = 140.\n\nExpanding that, it becomes s\u00b2 -4s = 140. Bringing 140 to the left side: s\u00b2 -4s -140 = 0.\n\nNow I need to solve this quadratic equation for s. Hmm, quadratic formula is the way to go. The quadratic equation is ax\u00b2 + bx + c =0, so here a=1, b=-4, c=-140.\n\nThe quadratic formula says s = [ -b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac) ] / (2a).\n\nPlugging in the values: b squared is (-4)^2 = 16. 4ac is 4*1*(-140) = -560. So the discriminant (b\u00b2 -4ac) is 16 - (-560) = 16 + 560 = 576. The square root of 576 is 24.\n\nSo s = [4 \u00b1 24]/2. Because -b is 4, so it's 4 plus or minus 24 divided by 2.\n\nSo two possible solutions: (4 +24)/2 = 28/2 =14. And (4 -24)/2 = (-20)/2 = -10. Since length can't be negative, s must be 14 feet.\n\nSo the original square had sides of 14 feet. So the perimeter of a square is 4 times the side. 4 *14 =56 feet.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 56. So the answer should be A)56.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Original square: side s, area s\u00b2.\n2. Trim 4 feet on one edge: new dimensions s and s-4.\n3. Rectangle area: s*(s-4) =140 (since each triangle is 70, rectangle is 140).\n4. Equation: s\u00b2 -4s -140=0.\n5. Using quadratic formula: s = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 +560)] /2 \u2192 sqrt(576)=24 \u2192 s= (28)/2=14 or -10.\n6. s=14, perimeter 4*14=56.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the answer should be A)56.\n",

Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. The question is asking for the perimeter of the original square cloth.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. So first, it's a square. Let's say the original square has sides of length 's' feet. So each side is 's', and the area is s squared.\n\nThen, they trim 4 feet off one edge. Wait, which edge? Oh, wait, it just says one edge, so I think it's one side that's trimmed by 4 feet. So, if the original square was s by s, trimming one edge by 4 feet would make the rectangle s by (s-4), right? Because one side is reduced by 4.\n\nSo the rectangle's dimensions are s feet by (s - 4) feet. Then this rectangle is cut diagonally in half, making two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. So, the area of the rectangle must be twice that, which is 140 square feet.\n\nWait, right. Because each triangle is half of the rectangle. So the area of the rectangle is 70 * 2 = 140. So I can set up an equation: s * (s -4) = 140.\n\nLet me write that equation out: s(s -4) = 140.\n\nExpanding that, it becomes s\u00b2 -4s = 140. Bringing 140 to the left side: s\u00b2 -4s -140 = 0.\n\nNow I need to solve this quadratic equation for s. Hmm, quadratic formula is the way to go. The quadratic equation is ax\u00b2 + bx + c =0, so here a=1, b=-4, c=-140.\n\nThe quadratic formula says s = [ -b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac) ] / (2a).\n\nPlugging in the values: b squared is (-4)^2 = 16. 4ac is 4*1*(-140) = -560. So the discriminant (b\u00b2 -4ac) is 16 - (-560) = 16 + 560 = 576. The square root of 576 is 24.\n\nSo s = [4 \u00b1 24]/2. Because -b is 4, so it's 4 plus or minus 24 divided by 2.\n\nSo two possible solutions: (4 +24)/2 = 28/2 =14. And (4 -24)/2 = (-20)/2 = -10. Since length can't be negative, s must be 14 feet.\n\nSo the original square had sides of 14 feet. So the perimeter of a square is 4 times the side. 4 *14 =56 feet.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 56. So the answer should be A)56.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Original square: side s, area s\u00b2.\n2. Trim 4 feet on one edge: new dimensions s and s-4.\n3. Rectangle area: s*(s-4) =140 (since each triangle is 70, rectangle is 140).\n4. Equation: s\u00b2 -4s -140=0.\n5.

After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the dimensions of the resulting rectangle become \\( s \\) and \\( s - 4 \\). The area of the rectangle is \\( s(s - 4) \\), and since the rectangle is cut diagonally into two triangles each with an area of 70 square feet, the total area of the rectangle is \\( 2 \\times 70 = 140 \\) square feet. This gives the equation:\n\n\\[\ns(s - 4) = 140\n\\]\n\nExpanding and rearranging:\n\n\\[\ns^2 - 4s - 140 = 0\n\\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula \\( s = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) with \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), and \\( c = -140 \\), the discriminant is:\n\n\\[\nb^2 - 4ac = (-4)^2 - 4(1)(-140) = 16 + 560 = 576\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root of the discriminant:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{576} = 24\n\\]\n\nSubstituting back into the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm 24}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm 24}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis gives two solutions:\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{4 + 24}{2} = 14 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad s = \\frac{4 - 24}{2} = -10\n\\]\n\nSince the side length cannot be negative, \\( s = 14 \\) feet.

Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's going on.\n\nSo, the problem says: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece. Then, this rectangle is cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. We need to find the perimeter of the original square cloth.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. The original shape is a square. Let's say the side length of the square is 's' feet. So, the area of the square would be s\u00b2.\n\nThen, the cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge. Wait, does that mean one edge is reduced by 4 feet, making it a rectangle? Because if you trim one edge, you're shortening one side. So, the original square has sides of length 's'. After trimming one edge by 4 feet, the new rectangle would have sides of (s - 4) and s. Because if you trim one edge, that edge becomes shorter by 4, but the other edges remain the same. So, the rectangle's dimensions are (s - 4) by s.\n\nWait, no. Wait a second. If it's a square, all edges are the same. So, if you trim 4 feet on one edge, perhaps you're making a rectangle where one side is s and the other is (s - 4). So, the rectangle would be s by (s -4). Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nThen, this rectangle is cut diagonally in half, making two triangles. Each triangle's area is 70 square feet. So, the area of the rectangle must be twice that, which is 140 square feet.\n\nWait, because each triangle is half of the rectangle, right? Because cutting a rectangle diagonally divides it into two congruent triangles. So, each triangle has half the area of the rectangle. So, if each triangle is 70, the rectangle must be 140.\n\nSo, the area of the rectangle is s*(s-4) = 140.\n\nSo, we can write that equation: s*(s-4) = 140.\n\nLet me write that down: s\u00b2 -4s =140. So, s\u00b2 -4s -140 = 0.\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation for s. Using the quadratic formula: s = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 560)] / 2.\n\nWait, because the equation is s\u00b2 -4s -140=0, so a=1, b=-4, c=-140.\n\nSo, discriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac = (-4)^2 -4*1*(-140) = 16 +560=576.\n\nSquare root of 576 is 24. So, s = [4 \u00b124]/2.\n\nWe can disregard the negative solution because length can't be negative. So, s = (4 +24)/2 = 28/2=14. Or s=(4-24)/2=-20/2=-10. But negative length doesn't make sense, so s=14.\n\nSo, the original square had sides of 14 feet each. Therefore, the perimeter of the square is 4*s =4*14=56 feet.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 56. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes I make mistakes.\n\nWait, the rectangle after trimming is (s) by (s-4). So, area is s*(s-4)=140. So, s\u00b2-4s=140. Which leads to s\u00b2-4s-140=0. Then quadratic formula gives s= [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 +560)]/2. sqrt(576)=24, so (4+24)/2=14. Correct.\n\nSo, original square's perimeter is 4*14=56. So, the correct answer is A)56.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because when you cut the rectangle diagonally, you get two triangles. Each triangle's area is 70, so rectangle is 140. The rectangle's area is s*(s-4)=140. So, s=14. That's correct.\n\nYes, I think I'm confident that the answer is A)56.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a square piece of cloth. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the problem says that the square is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge, turning it into a rectangle. Then this rectangle is cut diagonally into two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. I need to find the perimeter of the original square.\n\nWait, let's start from the beginning. The original shape is a square. So all sides are equal. Let's say the side length is 's' feet. So the original area would be s squared.\n\nThen, it's trimmed by 4 feet on one edge. Oh wait, does that mean one side is reduced by 4 feet, making it a rectangle? So if it's a square, trimming one edge by 4 would make one side s and the other s-4. So the new rectangle has dimensions s and s-4.\n\nAfter that, this rectangle is cut diagonally in half, making two triangles. Each triangle's area is 70. So the area of each triangle is half the area of the rectangle. Because when you cut a shape diagonally, each triangle has half the area of the original.\n\nSo the area of the rectangle is 2 times 70, which is 140. So the rectangle's area is 140 square feet.\n\nSo, the area of the rectangle is length times width. The rectangle's sides are s and s-4. So:\n\ns * (s - 4) = 140\n\nLet me write that equation: s(s-4) = 140\n\nExpanding that: s\u00b2 -4s = 140\n\nBring 140 to the left: s\u00b2 -4s -140 = 0\n\nNow I have a quadratic equation. Let me try to solve for s.\n\nThe quadratic formula is s = [4 \u00b1 sqrt( (\u22124)^2 -4*1*(-140) ) ] / (2*1)\n\nCalculating the discriminant: 16 + 560 = 576. Square root of 576 is 24.\n\nSo s = [4 \u00b124 ] / 2\n\nPossible solutions: (4 +24)/2 = 28/2 =14, and (4-24)/2= -20/2= -10.\n\nSince length can't be negative, s=14 feet.\n\nSo the original square was 14 feet on each side. The perimeter of a square is 4 times the side. So 4*14=56 feet.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 56. So that would be the answer.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me double-check my steps. I think I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, the rectangle after trimming is s by (s-4). So area s*(s-4)=140. Correct.\n\nSo s\u00b2 -4s -140=0. Quadratic equation. Using quadratic formula, yes, s=14.\n\nSo the original square has side 14, perimeter 56. So the answer should be A)56.\n\nBut wait, why is 56 the first option and the others are higher? Let me think again. Maybe I messed up the rectangle's dimensions.\n\nWait, the square is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge. So if it's a square, all sides are same. Trimming 4 feet on one edge would mean one side is now s-4, but the other side remains s? Or wait, maybe I misunderstood the trimming.\n\nWait, the problem says \"trimmed by 4 feet on one edge\". So imagine the square has four edges. If you trim one edge, perhaps you're reducing the length of one side. So the original square is s, after trimming, one side is s-4, the other remains s? No, that can't be right because that would make a rectangle with sides s and s-4. But then, cutting that rectangle diagonally would create two triangles each with area 70.\n\nWait, but the area of the rectangle is s*(s-4)=140. So with s=14, the rectangle is 14 by 10. So area 140. Each triangle would have 70, correct. So that's right.\n\nSo the perimeter of the original square is 4*s=56. So option A is correct.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a square piece of cloth. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the problem says that the square is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge, turning it into a rectangle. Then this rectangle is cut diagonally into two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. I need to find the perimeter of the original square.\n\nWait, let's start from the beginning. The original shape is a square. So all sides are equal. Let's say the side length is 's' feet. So the original area would be s squared.\n\nThen, it's trimmed by 4 feet on one edge. Oh wait, does that mean one side is reduced by 4 feet, making it a rectangle? So if it's a square, trimming one edge by 4 would make one side s and the other s-4. So the new rectangle has dimensions s and s-4.\n\nAfter that, this rectangle is cut diagonally in half, making two triangles. Each triangle's area is 70. So the area of each triangle is half the area of the rectangle. Because when you cut a shape diagonally, each triangle has half the area of the original.\n\nSo the area of the rectangle is 2 times 70, which is 140. So the rectangle's area is 140 square feet.\n\nSo, the area of the rectangle is length times width. The rectangle's sides are s and s-4. So:\n\ns * (s - 4) = 140\n\nLet me write that equation: s(s-4) = 140\n\nExpanding that: s\u00b2 -4s = 140\n\nBring 140 to the left: s\u00b2 -4s -140 = 0\n\nNow I have a quadratic equation. Let me try to solve for s.\n\nThe quadratic formula is s = [4 \u00b1 sqrt( (\u22124)^2 -4*1*(-140) ) ] / (2*1)\n\nCalculating the discriminant: 16 + 560 = 576. Square root of 576 is 24.\n\nSo s = [4 \u00b124 ] / 2\n\nPossible solutions: (4 +24)/2 = 28/2 =14, and (4-24)/2= -20/2= -10.\n\nSince length can't be negative, s=14 feet.\n\nSo the original square was 14 feet on each side. The perimeter of a square is 4 times the side. So 4*14=56 feet.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 56. So that would be the answer.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me double-check my steps. I think I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, the rectangle after trimming is s by (s-4). So area s*(s-4)=140. Correct.\n\nSo s\u00b2 -4s -140=0. Quadratic equation. Using quadratic formula, yes, s=14.\n\nSo the original square has side 14, perimeter 56. So the answer should be A)56.\n\nBut wait, why is 56 the first option and the others are higher? Let me think again. Maybe I messed up the rectangle's dimensions.\n\nWait, the square is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge. So if it's a square, all sides are same. Trimming 4 feet on one edge would mean one side is now s-4, but the other side remains s? Or wait, maybe I misunderstood the trimming.\n\nWait, the problem says \"trimmed by 4 feet on one edge\".

No, that can't be right because that would make a rectangle with sides s and s-4. But then, cutting that rectangle diagonally would create two triangles each with area 70.\n\nWait, but the area of the rectangle is s*(s-4)=140. So with s=14, the rectangle is 14 by 10. So area 140. Each triangle would have 70, correct. So that's right.\n\nSo the perimeter of the original square is 4*s=56. So option A is correct.

Then this rectangle is cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. We need to find the perimeter of the original square cloth.\n\nHmm, so let's break this down. The original shape is a square. Let's call the length of each side of the square 's' feet. That makes sense because all sides are equal in a square.\n\nThen, the cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge. Wait, does that mean one edge is reduced by 4 feet? Like, if you trim one edge, the square becomes a rectangle. So, for example, if the original square has sides of length 's', trimming 4 feet from one edge would make one side 's' and the other side 's - 4'. So the rectangle's dimensions are s feet by (s - 4) feet.\n\nWait, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's trimmed on one of the edges, so perhaps it's s by (s - 4), but which edge? Oh, since it's a square, trimming 4 feet from one edge would make one side s and the adjacent side s-4, so the rectangle is s by (s-4). That makes sense.\n\nThen, this rectangle is cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. So each triangle's area is 70, and there are two, so the area of the rectangle must be 140 square feet. Because 70 * 2 is 140.\n\nSo the area of the rectangle is s*(s-4) = 140. Let me write that equation down.\n\ns*(s - 4) = 140\n\nExpanding that, we get:\n\ns\u00b2 -4s = 140\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\ns\u00b2 -4s -140 = 0\n\nHmm, okay, solving this quadratic equation. Let's use the quadratic formula. The quadratic is s\u00b2 -4s -140 = 0.\n\nThe quadratic formula is s = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 560)] / 2. Because the discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac, which is (\u22124)^2 \u22124(1)(\u2212140) = 16 + 560 = 576.\n\nSo sqrt(576) is 24. So s = [4 \u00b1 24]/2.\n\nWe have two possible solutions: (4 + 24)/2 = 28/2 =14, and (4-24)/2= -20/2= -10.\n\nSince the length can't be negative, s=14 feet. So the original square has sides of 14 feet each.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Because the area of the rectangle is s*(s-4)=140, so s\u00b2-4s=140. That leads to s\u00b2-4s-140=0, which is what I had. So yes, the solution is 14 feet.\n\nSo the original square is 14x14. Therefore, the perimeter is 4*14=56 feet. Oh, but wait, the options given are A)56, B)58, etc. So option A is 56.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me think again. Because when you cut the rectangle diagonally, the area of each triangle is half of the rectangle.

The area of the rectangle is s*(s-4)=14*10=140. Yes, that's correct. Then each triangle is half of that, 70, which matches the problem statement.\n\nSo the original square's perimeter is 4*s =4*14=56 feet.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a square piece of cloth. Let's see what's going on. The question says that the cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangle. Then, this rectangle is cut diagonally in half, creating two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. I need to find the perimeter of the original square cloth.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. The original is a square, so all sides are equal. Let's call the side length of the square 's' feet. So, the area of the square is s squared, which is s^2.\n\nNow, the cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge. So, if the original square had sides of length 's', trimming 4 feet from one edge would make that side (s - 4) feet. Wait, but the other edges remain the same, right? So the resulting shape is a rectangle with sides of length (s) and (s - 4). Or wait, no, wait a second. If you trim one edge, does that mean you trim one pair of edges? Like, if it's a square, all four sides are the same. So trimming 4 feet on one edge\u2014does that mean you're cutting off 4 feet from one of the sides, making that side shorter by 4, but the opposite side remains the same? Or do you trim both the length and the width? Hmm, the question says it's trimmed by 4 feet on one edge, so I think it's just one side that's reduced by 4 feet. So the resulting rectangle would have dimensions s and (s - 4), right?\n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. Imagine a square cloth. If you trim 4 feet on one edge, that edge becomes s - 4, but the opposite edge is still s. So the other two edges remain s. So the rectangle would have sides of length s and (s - 4). So the area of the rectangle is s multiplied by (s - 4), which is s*(s-4).\n\nThen, this rectangle is cut diagonally in half, creating two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. So the area of the rectangle must be twice that, which is 140 square feet. Because each triangle is half the area of the rectangle.\n\nSo, the area of the rectangle is 140. Which means s*(s - 4) = 140.\n\nLet me write that equation down:\n\ns*(s - 4) = 140\n\nExpanding that gives:\n\ns\u00b2 -4s = 140\n\nBringing 140 to the left side:\n\ns\u00b2 -4s -140 = 0\n\nNow, I can solve this quadratic equation for s. Let's try using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is ax\u00b2 +bx +c =0, so a=1, b=-4, c=-140.\n\nThe quadratic formula is s = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\ns = [4 \u00b1 sqrt( (-4)^2 -4*1*(-140) ) ]/(2*1)\ns = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 560) ]/2\ns = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(576) ]/2\nsqrt(576) is 24.\n\nSo,\n\ns = [4 \u00b124 ] / 2\n\nWe have two possible solutions:\n\ns = (4 +24)/2 =28/2=14\n\ns = (4-24)/2= (-20)/2= -10\n\nBut since the side length can't be negative, s must be 14 feet.\n\nSo the original square had sides of 14 feet each. Therefore, the perimeter is 4 times 14, which is 56 feet.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So the rectangle after trimming has sides 14 and 10 (since 14-4=10). Area is 14*10=140. Then the rectangle is cut diagonally into two triangles, each with area 70, which makes sense.\n\nSo the perimeter of the original square is 4*14=56 feet. Looking at the options, option A is 56.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the problem, the options are:\n\nA)56\n\nB)58\n\nC)60\n\nD)62\n\nE)64\n\nSo the answer should be A)56.\n\nWait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the trimming part. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: A square piece is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangle. So, if the original is a square of side s, trimming 4 feet on one edge would make that edge (s-4), but the opposite edge remains s? Or wait, no.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a square piece of cloth. Let's see what's going on. The question says that the cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangle. Then, this rectangle is cut diagonally in half, creating two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. I need to find the perimeter of the original square cloth.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. The original is a square, so all sides are equal. Let's call the side length of the square 's' feet. So, the area of the square is s squared, which is s^2.\n\nNow, the cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge. So, if the original square had sides of length 's', trimming 4 feet from one edge would make that side (s - 4) feet. Wait, but the other edges remain the same, right? So the resulting shape is a rectangle with sides of length (s) and (s - 4). Or wait, no, wait a second. If you trim one edge, does that mean you trim one pair of edges? Like, if it's a square, all four sides are the same. So trimming 4 feet on one edge\u2014does that mean you're cutting off 4 feet from one of the sides, making that side shorter by 4, but the opposite side remains the same? Or do you trim both the length and the width? Hmm, the question says it's trimmed by 4 feet on one edge, so I think it's just one side that's reduced by 4 feet. So the resulting rectangle would have dimensions s and (s - 4), right?\n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. Imagine a square cloth. If you trim 4 feet on one edge, that edge becomes s - 4, but the opposite edge is still s. So the other two edges remain s. So the rectangle would have sides of length s and (s - 4). So the area of the rectangle is s multiplied by (s - 4), which is s*(s-4).\n\nThen, this rectangle is cut diagonally in half, creating two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. So the area of the rectangle must be twice that, which is 140 square feet. Because each triangle is half the area of the rectangle.\n\nSo, the area of the rectangle is 140. Which means s*(s - 4) = 140.\n\nLet me write that equation down:\n\ns*(s - 4) = 140\n\nExpanding that gives:\n\ns\u00b2 -4s = 140\n\nBringing 140 to the left side:\n\ns\u00b2 -4s -140 = 0\n\nNow, I can solve this quadratic equation for s. Let's try using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is ax\u00b2 +bx +c =0, so a=1, b=-4, c=-140.\n\nThe quadratic formula is s = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\ns = [4 \u00b1 sqrt( (-4)^2 -4*1*(-140) ) ]/(2*1)\ns = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 560) ]/2\ns = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(576) ]/2\nsqrt(576) is 24.\n\nSo,\n\ns = [4 \u00b124 ] / 2\n\nWe have two possible solutions:\n\ns = (4 +24)/2 =28/2=14\n\ns = (4-24)/2= (-20)/2= -10\n\nBut since the side length can't be negative, s must be 14 feet.\n\nSo the original square had sides of 14 feet each. Therefore, the perimeter is 4 times 14, which is 56 feet.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So the rectangle after trimming has sides 14 and 10 (since 14-4=10). Area is 14*10=140. Then the rectangle is cut diagonally into two triangles, each with area 70, which makes sense.\n\nSo the perimeter of the original square is 4*14=56 feet. Looking at the options, option A is 56.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the problem, the options are:\n\nA)56\n\nB)58\n\nC)60\n\nD)62\n\nE)64\n\nSo the answer should be A)56.\n\nWait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the trimming part. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: A square piece is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangle. So, if the original is a square of side s, trimming 4 feet on one edge would make that edge (s-4), but the opposite edge remains s? Or wait, no. Wait, when you trim a square on one edge, you're probably trimming one side by 4, so the adjacent sides remain s, but the opposite side is also s. So the rectangle would have sides of s and (s-4).\n\nWait, but that makes the rectangle s by (s-4). So that's correct.\n\nSo with s=14, the rectangle is 14 by 10, area 140. Each triangle is 70, which fits.\n\nSo the perimeter is 4*14=56, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the quadratic solution. s\u00b2-4s-140=0.\n\nLet me compute s again:\n\nDiscriminant D = 16 + 560 =576. sqrt(576)=24.\n\ns=(4 +24)/2=28/2=14. Correct.\n\nSo everything seems to check out. The answer should be A)56.\n\n\nThe original piece of cloth is a square with side length \\( s \\).

So a=1, b=-4, c=-140.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula: s = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)] / (2a).\n\nPlugging in the values: b\u00b2 is (-4)^2=16. 4ac is 4*1*(-140)= -560. So the discriminant is 16 - (4*1*(-140)) which is 16 +560 = 576. Square root of 576 is 24.\n\nSo s = [4 \u00b124]/2. Wait, because -b is 4.

Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. We need to find the perimeter of the original square cloth.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. First, the original cloth is a square. Let's call the length of each side of the square 'x' feet. So the original area is x squared.\n\nThen, it's trimmed by 4 feet on one edge. Wait, does that mean one edge is reduced by 4 feet, making it a rectangle? So if the original square had sides of x, after trimming one edge by 4 feet, one side becomes x-4, and the other remains x. So the rectangle's dimensions are x by (x-4).\n\nNext, this rectangle is cut diagonally in half, resulting in two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. So the area of the rectangle must be twice that, which is 140 square feet.\n\nWait, so the area of the rectangle is x*(x-4) = 140.\n\nLet me write that as an equation: x(x - 4) = 140.\n\nExpanding that, it becomes x\u00b2 -4x =140. Then moving 140 to the left side: x\u00b2 -4x -140 = 0.\n\nNow I need to solve this quadratic equation for x. Let me see, using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, so a=1, b=-4, c=-140.\n\nThe quadratic formula is x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a). Plugging in the values: x = [4 \u00b1 sqrt( (\u22124)^2 \u22124*1*(\u2212140) ) ]/(2*1).\n\nCalculating under the square root: 16 + 560 = 576. Because 4*1*140 is 560, and since c is -140, it's minus a negative, which becomes plus. So sqrt(576) is 24.\n\nSo x = [4 \u00b124]/2. Since length can't be negative, we take the positive solution: (4 +24)/2 = 28/2 =14. So x=14.\n\nWait, that would make the original square's side 14 feet. So the perimeter would be 4 times that, which is 56 feet. Hmm, looking at the options, A is 56. So that would be the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Because sometimes when you trim a square, you might trim both edges? Or does trimming on one edge only affect one side? The problem says trimmed by 4 feet on one edge. So I think only one edge is reduced by 4, so the other remains x. So the rectangle is x by (x-4). That makes sense.\n\nSo the area is x(x-4) =140. So yes, x=14. Then the original square was 14x14, perimeter 56. So the answer should be option A)56.\n\nWait, but another thought: when you cut the rectangle diagonally, each triangle's area is half of the rectangle's area. So each triangle is 70, so rectangle is 140. So my calculation was correct.\n\nLet me make sure that when x=14, the rectangle is 14 by 10 (14-4=10). 14*10=140, correct.

Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. We need to find the perimeter of the original square cloth.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. First, the original cloth is a square. Let's call the length of each side of the square 'x' feet. So the original area is x squared.\n\nThen, it's trimmed by 4 feet on one edge. Wait, does that mean one edge is reduced by 4 feet, making it a rectangle? So if the original square had sides of x, after trimming one edge by 4 feet, one side becomes x-4, and the other remains x. So the rectangle's dimensions are x by (x-4).\n\nNext, this rectangle is cut diagonally in half, resulting in two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. So the area of the rectangle must be twice that, which is 140 square feet.\n\nWait, so the area of the rectangle is x*(x-4) = 140.\n\nLet me write that as an equation: x(x - 4) = 140.\n\nExpanding that, it becomes x\u00b2 -4x =140. Then moving 140 to the left side: x\u00b2 -4x -140 = 0.\n\nNow I need to solve this quadratic equation for x. Let me see, using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, so a=1, b=-4, c=-140.\n\nThe quadratic formula is x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a). Plugging in the values: x = [4 \u00b1 sqrt( (\u22124)^2 \u22124*1*(\u2212140) ) ]/(2*1).\n\nCalculating under the square root: 16 + 560 = 576. Because 4*1*140 is 560, and since c is -140, it's minus a negative, which becomes plus. So sqrt(576) is 24.\n\nSo x = [4 \u00b124]/2. Since length can't be negative, we take the positive solution: (4 +24)/2 = 28/2 =14. So x=14.\n\nWait, that would make the original square's side 14 feet. So the perimeter would be 4 times that, which is 56 feet. Hmm, looking at the options, A is 56. So that would be the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Because sometimes when you trim a square, you might trim both edges? Or does trimming on one edge only affect one side? The problem says trimmed by 4 feet on one edge. So I think only one edge is reduced by 4, so the other remains x. So the rectangle is x by (x-4). That makes sense.\n\nSo the area is x(x-4) =140. So yes, x=14. Then the original square was 14x14, perimeter 56. So the answer should be option A)56.\n\nWait, but another thought: when you cut the rectangle diagonally, each triangle's area is half of the rectangle's area. So each triangle is 70, so rectangle is 140. So my calculation was correct.\n\nLet me make sure that when x=14, the rectangle is 14 by 10 (14-4=10). 14*10=140, correct. So the area of each triangle is 70. That all adds up.\n\nSo the original square has side 14, perimeter 4*14=56. So the answer is A)56.\n\n\nThe original cloth is a square with side length \\( x \\). After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the dimensions of the resulting rectangle are \\( x \\) and \\( x - 4 \\). The area of the rectangle is therefore \\( x(x - 4) \\). Since the rectangle is cut diagonally into two triangles, each triangle has an area of 70 square feet, making the total area of the rectangle \\( 140 \\, \\text{square feet} \\). Thus, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\nx(x - 4) = 140\n\\]\n\nExpanding and rearranging:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x - 140 = 0\n\\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula \\( x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) with \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), and \\( c = -140 \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 560}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{576}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm 24}{2}\n\\]\n\nTaking the positive root:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4 + 24}{2} = 14\n\\]\n\nThus, the original square has a side length of \\( 14 \\, \\text{feet} \\). The perimeter of the square is:\n\n\\[\n4 \\times 14 = 56 \\, \\text{feet}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the original square cloth is **56 feet**.\n\nAnswer: A",

Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. I need to find the perimeter of the original square cloth.\n\nHmm, alright. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the original shape is a square. So all sides are equal. Let's call the length of each side 's' feet. So the original area is s squared, s\u00b2.\n\nThen, the cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge. Wait, so trimming one edge would reduce the length of that side by 4 feet, right? Because trimming a square on one edge, like cutting off 4 feet from one side, would make it a rectangle. So the original square becomes a rectangle with sides (s) and (s-4), since one side is reduced by 4 feet.\n\nWait, but which edge is trimmed? Oh, it says one edge, so I think one side is reduced by 4. So the new rectangle has dimensions s by (s-4). Because the original square has sides of length s, so one dimension remains s, and the other becomes s-4 after trimming.\n\nWait, but wait a second. No, wait. If the cloth is a square, then all sides are equal. When you trim 4 feet on one edge, does that mean you trim it from one side, making that side shorter by 4? Or does it mean you trim from both ends of that edge, making it 4 feet shorter overall?\n\nOh, right, I think it's the latter. Like, if you have a square, say, 10x10, and you trim 4 feet on one edge, you're cutting 4 feet off the length, making it 6 feet in that dimension. So the rectangle would be 10 by 6. So yes, the new dimensions are s and (s-4).\n\nSo the area of the rectangle is s*(s-4) = s\u00b2 -4s.\n\nThen, this rectangle is cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. So the area of each triangle is half the area of the rectangle. So the area of the rectangle must be 2 * 70 = 140 square feet.\n\nSo, the equation is s*(s-4) = 140.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\ns(s -4) = 140\n\nExpanding that: s\u00b2 -4s =140.\n\nBring 140 to the left: s\u00b2 -4s -140 =0.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation. To solve for s, I can use the quadratic formula.\n\nQuadratic equation: ax\u00b2 + bx + c =0. So here, a=1, b= -4, c= -140.\n\nThe quadratic formula is s = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\ns = [4 \u00b1 sqrt( (-4)^2 -4*1*(-140) )]/(2*1)\ns = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 560)]/2\ns = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(576)]/2\nsqrt(576) is 24.\n\nSo s = [4 \u00b124]/2\n\nWe can ignore the negative solution because length can't be negative.\n\nSo s = (4 +24)/2 =28/2=14.\n\nSo the original square had sides of 14 feet each.\n\nWait, let me check that. If s=14, then after trimming 4 feet, the rectangle is 14 x (14-4)=14x10. The area is 140, which when cut diagonally gives two triangles each of area 70. That makes sense.\n\nSo the original square's perimeter is 4*s =4*14=56 feet.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 56. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check. Did I make any mistake in the setup?\n\nThe area of each triangle is 70, so the rectangle's area is 140. The rectangle is s by (s-4), so s(s-4)=140. Solving gives s=14. Perimeter is 4*14=56. That's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be option A, 56.\n",
