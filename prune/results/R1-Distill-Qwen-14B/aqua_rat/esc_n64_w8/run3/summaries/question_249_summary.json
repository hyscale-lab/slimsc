      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So the question is asking for the sum of three consecutive integers. Hmm, wait, no, actually, the product of three consecutive integers equals 727 plus 728 plus 729. Then, we need to find the sum of those three consecutive integers. The options given are A to E, with the answer being one of them.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have three consecutive integers. Let's call them n, n+1, and n+2. Their product is equal to the sum of 727, 728, and 729. Then, we're supposed to find the sum of these three integers, which would be n + (n+1) + (n+2) = 3n + 3. So the sum is 3(n+1). Alternatively, since they're consecutive, the sum is three times the middle number.\n\nWait, but the question is about the product of three consecutive integers. Let me compute the sum 727 + 728 + 729 first. Let's see, 727 + 728 is 1455, and adding 729 gives 2184. So the product of the three consecutive integers is 2184.\n\nSo, now I need to find three consecutive integers whose product is 2184. Let me denote the integers as n, n+1, n+2. So n*(n+1)*(n+2) = 2184.\n\nI think I should solve for n here. Let me try to find n such that the product equals 2184. Maybe I can approximate the cube root of 2184 to get an idea of where n might be.\n\nCalculating cube root of 2184: Well, 12^3 is 1728, 13^3 is 2197. Oh, wait! 13^3 is 2197, which is very close to 2184. Hmm, but 2197 is 13*13*13. So 2184 is 2197 minus 13, which is 13*(13^2 - 1) = 13*(169-1)=13*168=2184.\n\nWait, but that's 13*12*14? Let me check: 12*13*14. Let's compute that. 12*13 is 156, then 156*14. 156 *10 is 1560, 156*4 is 624, so 1560+624=2184. Oh, so 12*13*14 equals 2184. That means the three consecutive integers are 12,13,14. Because 12,13,14 are consecutive. So their sum is 12+13+14.\n\nLet me add those: 12+13 is 25, plus 14 is 39. So the sum is 39. Looking at the options, E is 39. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait a second, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me verify the product again. 12*13 is 156, then 156 *14. Let me compute 156*14: 150*14=2100, 6*14=84, so 2100+84=2184. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the three numbers are 12,13,14, sum is 39. So the correct option is E.\n",

So first, I should calculate what that sum is.\n\nCalculating that: 727 + 728 is 1455, and adding 729 gives 1455 + 729 = 2184.

Let me write that down: (n-1)*n*(n+1) = 2184.\n\nBut wait, n-1, n, n+1 are three consecutive integers. Their product is n(n\u00b2 -1) = n\u00b3 -n. So n\u00b3 -n = 2184.\n\nSo I need to find an integer n such that n\u00b3 -n = 2184. Hmm. Let's see, maybe I can approximate this.\n\nLet me compute n^3 for some numbers. Let's see:\n\n12^3 is 1728. 13^3 is 2197. Oh, wait, 13^3 is 2197, which is just a bit more than 2184.\n\nSo 13^3 is 2197. So 13^3 minus 13 is 2197 -13 = 2184. Oh! So that's exactly the product. So n is 13.\n\nSo the three consecutive integers are 12, 13, 14.\n\nWait, because (13-1)=12, 13, and 14.

Then their product is (n-1)*n*(n+1) = n(n\u00b2-1) = n\u00b3 - n. And this equals 2184.\n\nSo we have n\u00b3 - n = 2184. Let me write that equation: n\u00b3 - n = 2184.\n\nHmm, solving for n. Since n is an integer, perhaps we can find n by trial and error. Let's think about possible n values.\n\nLet me try n=12: 12\u00b3 is 1728. 1728 -12 = 1716. That's less than 2184.\n\nn=13: 13\u00b3 is 2197. 2197 -13 = 2184. Oh, exactly the number we're looking for. So n=13.\n\nSo the three consecutive integers are 12,13,14. Their sum is 12+13+14 = 39.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me compute 12*13*14. 12*13 is 156, then 156*14: 156*10 is 1560, 156*4 is 624, total 2184. Yep, correct.\n\nSo their sum is 12+13+14=39. Looking at the options, E is 39. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if I interpreted the question correctly. The question says \"three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727+728+729.\" So yes, their product is 2184, and the sum is 39, which is option E.\n\n\nThe problem asks for the sum of three consecutive integers whose product equals the sum of 727, 728, and 729. First, calculate the sum of these three numbers:\n\n\\[\n727 + 728 + 729 = 2184\n\\]\n\nThus, the product of the three consecutive integers is 2184. Let the three consecutive integers be \\(n-1\\), \\(n\\), and \\(n+1\\). Their product is:\n\n\\[\n(n-1) \\cdot n \\cdot (n+1) = n(n^2 - 1) = n^3 - n\n\\]\n\nSet this equal to 2184:\n\n\\[\nn^3 - n = 2184\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\(n\\), test integer values. For \\(n = 12\\):\n\n\\[\n12^3 - 12 = 1728 - 12 = 1716 \\quad (\\text{too small})\n\\]\n\nFor \\(n = 13\\):\n\n\\[\n13^3 - 13 = 2197 - 13 = 2184 \\quad (\\text{correct})\n\\]\n\nThus, the three consecutive integers are \\(12\\), \\(13\\), and \\(14\\). Their sum is:\n\n\\[\n12 + 13 + 14 = 39\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**Answer: E**",

Let me break this down. First, I need to find three consecutive integers. Let's call them x, x+1, and x+2 because they're consecutive. Their product is x*(x+1)*(x+2). The problem says that this product is equal to 727 + 728 + 729. So, I need to calculate that sum first.\n\nCalculating 727 + 728 + 729. Let me add them up. 727 plus 728 is 1455, and adding 729 gives 1455 + 729. Let me compute that. 1455 + 700 is 2155, then plus 29 is 2184. So the product of the three consecutive integers is 2184.\n\nSo now the equation is x*(x+1)*(x+2) = 2184. I need to find x such that this product equals 2184, then find the sum x + (x+1) + (x+2) which is 3x +3. But first, I need to find x.\n\nWait, but maybe I can find x by estimating. Let's see, 2184 is the product. Let me think about the cube root of 2184 because the product of three consecutive numbers around x would be roughly x^3. The cube root of 2184 is... let me think. 12^3 is 1728, 13^3 is 2197. Oh, wait, 13^3 is 2197, which is just a bit more than 2184. So x is probably 12 or 13. Let me check.\n\nLet me try x=12. 12*13*14. 12*13 is 156, then 156*14. Let's compute that. 156 *10 is 1560, 156*4 is 624, so total is 1560+624=2184. Oh, that's exactly the number we need.

But let me make sure I didn't miscalculate anything.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me compute 727 +728 +729 again. 727+728 is 1455, adding 729 gives 1455+729. 729 is 700+29. 1455+700=2155, plus 29 is 2184. Correct.\n\nSo the product is 2184, which comes from 12*13*14. So the three numbers are 12,13,14. Sum is 12+13=25, +14=39. So the sum is 39, which is option E.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 39. So the answer should be E. But wait, wait, another thought: Are the three consecutive integers perhaps negative numbers? Because the product is positive, so either all three are positive or two are negative and one is positive. But let's see.\n\nIf x were negative, say x=-14, then x+1=-13, x+2=-12. Their product would be (-14)*(-13)*(-12). Let me compute that. 14*13 is 182, 182*12 is 2184, but since there are three negative numbers, the product is negative. So 2184 is positive, so that can't be. So x must be positive. So 12,13,14 is correct.\n\nSo the sum is 39, which is option E. But wait, looking back at the options, E is 39.

Let me estimate n. 2184 is approximately 2000, so cube root of 2000 is about 12.6. So let's try n=12: 12^3 is 1728. 1728 -12 is 1716, which is much less than 2184.\n\nn=13: 13^3=2197. 2197-13=2184. Oh! That's exactly the number we're looking for. So n is 13.\n\nSo the three consecutive integers are 12,13,14. Their product is 12*13*14 = 2184, which matches.\n\nNow, the sum of these three integers is 12 +13 +14 = 39. So the answer should be 39. Looking at the options, option E is 39.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check. The product is 12*13*14: 12*13 is 156, 156*14 is 2184. Yep. And the sum is 12+13+14=39. So the correct answer is E)39.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the question. Let me check again. The product is 727+728+729. That's 2184.

The question says: What is the sum of three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727 + 728 + 729.\n\nHmm, wait a minute. Let me break that down. First, I think I need to figure out what 727 + 728 + 729 equals. Because the product of the three consecutive integers is that sum. Once I find that sum, I can then find three consecutive integers whose product equals that sum and then find their sum.\n\nSo let me calculate 727 + 728 + 729.

Their sum is:\n\n\\[\n12 + 13 + 14 = 39\n\\]\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n**Answer: E**",
