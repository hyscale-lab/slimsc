      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about two cars starting from opposite ends of a 50-mile highway. They begin at the same time, and each is going a different speed. I need to find out how long it takes for them to meet. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the scenario. The highway is 50 miles long. Car A starts from one end, say the west end, going east at 12 mph. Car B starts from the east end, going west at 13 mph. They're moving towards each other, right? So their speeds will add up when calculating the time until they meet.\n\nWait, I remember that when two objects are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. So in this case, the combined speed is 12 + 13, which is 25 mph. That makes sense because they're closing the distance between them at 25 miles every hour.\n\nNow, the total distance they need to cover before meeting is 50 miles. Since they're moving towards each other, the time it takes for them to meet can be found by dividing the total distance by their combined speed. So the formula should be time = distance / speed.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: time = 50 miles / 25 mph. Let me do the division. 50 divided by 25 is 2. Wait, that can't be right. Because 25 mph times 2 hours would be 50 miles. Oh, wait, but wait, that would mean each car has traveled for 2 hours. Let me double-check that.\n\nWait, no, that's correct. Because in 2 hours, Car A would have gone 12 mph * 2 h = 24 miles. Car B would have gone 13 mph * 2 h = 26 miles. Adding those together, 24 + 26 equals 50 miles, which is exactly the length of the highway. So they meet after 2 hours. So the time is 2 hours.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial approach. Sometimes when I'm tired, I might mix up the concepts. Oh right, relative speed is the key here. Since they're moving towards each other, their speeds add. So yeah, 12 +13 =25 mph. So 50 miles divided by 25 mph is 2 hours. That seems right.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, the answer options are A)1, B)1.25, C)1.50, D)1.75, E)2. So E is 2, which matches my calculation. So the correct answer should be E.\n\nWait, but did I miscalculate anything? Let me check another way. Suppose they meet after t hours. Then Car A would have gone 12t miles, and Car B 13t miles. The sum of these distances should be 50 miles.\n\nSo 12t + 13t = 50\n(12+13) t =50\n25t=50\nt=50/25=2. So yeah, t is 2. So E is correct.\n\nI think I'm confident now. So the answer is E) 2.\n",

Oh right, when two objects are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. So in this case, the first car is moving at 12 mph, and the second at 13 mph.

So in one hour, the first car would cover 12 miles, the second 13. Together, they cover 25 miles in an hour. So to cover 50 miles, it would take 2 hours. Because 25 times 2 is 50. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. Let me think about another approach. Let's say after time t, they meet. So the distance covered by the first car is 12t, and the second is 13t.

So E is 2 hours. So why am I confused? Did I do something wrong?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in adding the speeds. Let me check again. 12 plus 13 is 25, right. So the combined speed is 25 mph. So 50 miles divided by 25 mph is indeed 2 hours. So the answer should be E) 2.\n\nWait, but the options have other numbers. Could I have misread the question? Let me see. Oh, the highway is 50 miles long. So the distance between them is 50 miles. So yeah, the calculation should be correct. So the time is 2 hours. So option E is correct.\n\n\nThe two cars start from opposite ends of a 50-mile highway and move towards each other. The first car travels at 12 mph, and the second car travels at 13 mph. Since they are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds:  \n\\[\n12 \\, \\text{mph} + 13 \\, \\text{mph} = 25 \\, \\text{mph}.\n\\]\n\nThe total distance between them is 50 miles. To find the time it takes for them to meet, use the formula:  \n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:  \n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{50 \\, \\text{miles}}{25 \\, \\text{mph}} = 2 \\, \\text{hours}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the cars will meet after 2 hours. The correct answer is:  \n**Answer: E**",
