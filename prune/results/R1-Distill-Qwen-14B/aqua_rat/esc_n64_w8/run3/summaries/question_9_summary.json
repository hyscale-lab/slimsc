      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about 200 students in a school. The question is about figuring out the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session. Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nAlright, the problem says that at least 45% attended the prom. So 45% of 200 is 90 students. That means the number of prom attendees is at least 90. Similarly, at least 35% took part in the debating session. 35% of 200 is 70, so at least 70 students were in the debate.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the maximum number of students who did neither. To maximize that, I think we need to minimize the number of students who attended either event or both. Because if more students went to either, fewer would be left out.\n\nSo, the idea is to find the minimum number of students who went to prom, debate, or both. Then subtract that from the total to get those who did neither.\n\nLet me remember the principle here. Oh right, it's the inclusion-exclusion principle. The total number who attended either event is at least the sum of each event minus their overlap. So, the minimum number attending either is Prom + Debate - Both.\n\nBut since we're trying to minimize the number attending either, we want to maximize the overlap (students who went to both). Because the more overlap, the fewer total unique students attended either event.\n\nWait, so to find the minimum number of students who attended at least one event, we can calculate it as Prom + Debate - Both. But Both can't exceed the smaller of Prom or Debate. Since Prom is at least 90 and Debate at least 70, the maximum Both can be is 70 (since that's the smaller number).\n\nSo the minimum number attending either is 90 + 70 - Both. To minimize that, we set Both as high as possible, which is 70. So 90 +70 -70 =90. So the minimum number of students who attended either is 90.\n\nWait, wait a second. No, wait. Because the minimum number attending either is when their overlap is maximum. So if both events have maximum possible overlap, then the total unique attendees are minimized.\n\nWait, let me think again. The maximum possible overlap is the smaller of the two numbers. So if 90 went to prom and 70 to debate, the maximum overlap is 70. So 90 +70 -70 =90. So 90 students attended either event.\n\nSo the number of students who attended at least one event is at least 90. Therefore, the maximum number of students who didn't attend either would be 200 -90 =110.\n\nWait, but wait, the options have 110 as option E. But wait, let me check the math again.\n\nWait, the problem says at least 45% attended prom, which is 90, and at least 35% debated, which is 70. So the minimum attendees for prom is 90, minimum for debate is 70. To find the minimum number who attended either, it's 90 +70 - maximum possible overlap.\n\nThe maximum possible overlap can't be more than 70 because you can't have more people in both than the number in the smaller group. So 90 +70 -70=90. So 90 is the minimum number attending either. So 200-90=110 is the maximum who didn't attend either.\n\nSo the answer should be E) 110.\n\nBut wait, wait another thing. Wait, the problem is asking for the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom nor the debate. So to maximize that, we need to minimize the number of students who attended at least one of the two events. \n\nYes, because if fewer students went to either, then more could be left out.\n\nSo the way to get the minimum number attending at least one is to have as much overlap as possible between the two groups. So if all 70 debate attendees were also prom attendees, then the total unique attendees are 90 (prom) +0 (since debate adds nothing new beyond the 70 already counted in prom). Wait, no. Wait, the prom has 90 attendees, and if all 70 debate attendees are within that 90, then the total is 90. So 90 is the minimum possible number of students attending either event.\n\nSo 200 -90 =110 is the maximum number not attending either.\n\nSo the correct answer is E) 110.\n",

Again, it's at least 35%, so it could be more.\n\nWe're asked for the maximum number of students who neither attended the prom nor the debate. So, to maximize the number of students not in either, we need to minimize the number of students who attended at least one of the events. But wait, the problem says \"at least 45% attended the prom\" and \"at least 35% debated.\" So, the minimum number attending prom is 90, and the minimum for debate is 70. But the total number attending either could be as low as the sum, but wait, that's not possible because of overlap.\n\nWait, using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The maximum number who attended either event is the sum of those who attended prom and those who debated, minus the overlap. But since we're trying to find the maximum number of students who didn't attend either, we need the minimum number of students who attended at least one.\n\nWait, no, wait. To find the maximum number who neither attended, we need the minimal number who attended at least one. Because the more students attend at least one, the fewer are left who didn't attend either.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. To maximize the number of students who did neither, we need as few students as possible to have attended either event. But the constraints are that at least 90 attended prom, and at least 70 debated.\n\nSo, the minimum number that attended prom is 90, the minimum for debate is 70. But the total number attending either could be as low as 90 + 70 - overlap. But the overlap can't be more than 70 because you can't have more people in both events than the number in either.\n\nWait, but in order to find the minimal number of students who attended at least one event, we need to maximize the overlap. Because if the overlap is as large as possible, the total number attending either event is minimized. So, for example, if all 70 debaters also attended prom, then the total number attending either would be 90. Because 70 are in both, so 90 + 70 -70 =90.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the minimal number of students attending either event is 90. Because if all debaters are included in the prom attendees, then the total is just the prom attendees. So, the minimum number is 90.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Suppose 90 went to prom, and 70 debated. If all 70 debaters are part of the 90 who went to prom, then the total number who went to prom or debated is 90, because the 70 are already included. So, 90 is the minimum number of students who attended at least one event.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of students who neither attended prom nor debated is 200 - 90 = 110.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 110.

But wait, I thought the maximum number who could have neither would be 200 minus the minimum number attending either event.\n\nWait, but wait, another approach: the minimal number attending prom is 90, the minimal attending debate is 70. So, the minimal number attending either is 90 +70 - x, where x is the overlap. But since the maximum possible overlap is 70, because you can't have more people in both than the smaller group. So, the minimal number attending either is 90 +70 -70 =90. So, 200 -90=110.\n\nHmm, that would make the answer E)110.\n\nBut wait, another way to think: Let me imagine that exactly 90 attended prom, exactly 70 debated, and all 70 debaters were also prom attendees. Then, the number who attended either is 90, so neither is 200-90=110. So that's the maximum possible.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"at least 45% attended prom\" and \"at least 35% debated.\" So, can we have more than 90 attending prom? Let's say 100. Then, if the 70 debaters are all in that 100, the total attending either is 100. So, neither is 100. Which is less than 110. So, to maximize neither, we need the minimal total attending either, which is 90. So, 110 is the maximum.\n\nWait, but wait another point: the problem says \"at least 45% attended the prom night.\" So, the number attending prom could be 90 or more. But to minimize the number who attended either, you want the number attending prom to be as small as possible. Because if you have more, like 100, then even if all 70 are in that 100, the total is 100, which is higher than 90. So, to get the minimal, you take the minimal possible for each, which is 90 and 70. So, the minimal total is 90.\n\nSo, 200-90=110.\n\nSo, the answer should be E)110.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Suppose 90 went to prom, 70 debated, and all 70 were part of the 90.

Hmm, it's about figuring out the maximum number of students who didn't attend either the prom night or the debating session. The school has 200 students in total.\n\nAlright, so the problem says at least 45% attended the prom. Let me calculate that. 45% of 200 is 90 students. So, at least 90 went to prom.

So, at least 70 attended the debate.\n\nThe question is asking for the maximum number of students who could have neither gone to the prom nor the debate. To maximize this number, I think I need to minimize the number of students who went to at least one of the events.

Oh right, this is an inclusion-exclusion problem. The formula for the minimum number of students who attended either event is the sum of the students in each event minus the maximum possible overlap. But since we're trying to find the minimum number who attended either, I need the maximum overlap.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. The minimum number who attended at least one is equal to the sum of prom attendees plus debate attendees minus the maximum possible overlap. Because if the overlap is as big as possible, the total number of unique attendees would be as small as possible, which is what we want to maximize the neither group.\n\nSo the maximum overlap would be when as many students as possible went to both events. The maximum possible overlap can't be more than the smaller of the two percentages. So prom is 90, debate is 70. So the maximum possible overlap is 70. Because you can't have more students overlapping than the smaller group.\n\nSo, if 70 students went to both, then the number who went to prom only is 90 -70 =20, and debate only is 70-70=0. So total attendees would be 20 +70 =90. Wait, no. Wait, the total unique attendees would be prom attendees plus debate attendees minus overlap. So 90 +70 -70 =90.\n\nWait, that's right. So the minimum number of students who attended either event is 90. Because if all 70 debate attendees were also prom attendees, then total unique is 90.\n\nSo, the maximum number of students who didn't attend either is total students minus this number. So 200 -90=110. Wait, but wait, that's one of the options. Option E is 110.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Because I might have made a mistake in the logic. So the question says at least 45% went to prom, meaning 90 or more. Similarly, at least 35% (70) went to debate.\n\nTo maximize the number who didn't go to either, I need as few as possible to have gone to at least one. The minimum number attending at least one is the sum of prom and debate minus the maximum possible overlap. So 90 +70 =160.

So E is the answer.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because another way to think about it is, if I have 90 prom attendees and 70 debate attendees, the maximum possible number who attended both is 70.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about figuring out the maximum number of students who didn't attend either the prom night or the debating session. The school has 200 students in total.\n\nAlright, so the problem says at least 45% attended the prom. Let me calculate that. 45% of 200 is 90 students. So, at least 90 went to prom. Similarly, at least 35% took part in the debating session. 35% of 200 is 70 students. So, at least 70 attended the debate.\n\nThe question is asking for the maximum number of students who could have neither gone to the prom nor the debate. To maximize this number, I think I need to minimize the number of students who went to at least one of the events. Because the more students who went to either event, the fewer are left who didn't go to either.\n\nWait, but how do I find the minimum number of students who attended at least one of the two events? Oh right, this is an inclusion-exclusion problem. The formula for the minimum number of students who attended either event is the sum of the students in each event minus the maximum possible overlap. But since we're trying to find the minimum number who attended either, I need the maximum overlap.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. The minimum number who attended at least one is equal to the sum of prom attendees plus debate attendees minus the maximum possible overlap.

The maximum possible overlap can't be more than the smaller of the two percentages. So prom is 90, debate is 70. So the maximum possible overlap is 70. Because you can't have more students overlapping than the smaller group.\n\nSo, if 70 students went to both, then the number who went to prom only is 90 -70 =20, and debate only is 70-70=0. So total attendees would be 20 +70 =90. Wait, no. Wait, the total unique attendees would be prom attendees plus debate attendees minus overlap. So 90 +70 -70 =90.\n\nWait, that's right. So the minimum number of students who attended either event is 90.

I need to find the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom nor the debate. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I think I should calculate the minimum numbers for each event because the question says \"at least.\" So for prom night, 45% of 200 is... let's see, 45% of 200 is 0.45 * 200 = 90 students.

So, the maximum possible overlap is the smaller of the two numbers. Wait, the prom had 90 attendees, and debate had 70. So the maximum possible overlap is 70 students, because all debate attendees could have also gone to prom.\n\nSo the minimum number of students who attended at least one event would be 90 (prom) + 70 (debate) - 70 (overlap) = 90 + 70 -70 = 90.\n\nWait, that's 90. So the minimum number of students who attended either event is 90.

No, the maximum possible is the smaller of the two, which is 70. Because you can't have more people attending both than the size of the smaller group.

Because if more students went to at least one of the events, fewer would be left without attending either.\n\nWait, no. Wait, actually, to find the maximum number who did neither, we should minimize the number who attended either event. Because the total is fixed, so the more you have in either, the less you have in neither. But wait, the problem says 'at least' so the minimum number who attended prom is 45% of 200. Let me calculate that.\n\n45% of 200 is 0.45 * 200 = 90 students. So at least 90 went to prom. Similarly, at least 35% is 0.35 *200=70 students attended the debate.\n\nSo, the minimum number of students who attended prom is 90, and for debate it's 70.\n\nBut wait, if we want to find the maximum number who didn't attend either, we need to consider the overlap between prom and debate attendees. Because some students might have gone to both, so to maximize the number of students who did neither, we should assume as little overlap as possible. Or wait, no, maybe the other way around. Let me think.\n\nWait, the maximum number of students who neither attended prom nor debates would occur when the number of students who attended at least one of the events is as small as possible. Because if more students are in the 'attended at least one' category, that leaves fewer in the neither category.\n\nWait, but the problem says at least 45% attended prom and at least 35% attended debates. So the minimum number in prom is 90, the minimum in debates is 70. But if we add those together, 90 +70=160. But the total number of students is 200, so the maximum possible overlap (so that the total number of students who attended at least one is minimized) would be when the overlap is as large as possible. Because if a lot of students went to both, then the total number of students who attended at least one is 90+70 - overlap. So to minimize that sum, the overlap should be as large as possible.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try another approach. The maximum number of students who neither attended prom nor debates would be the total number of students minus the minimum number of students who attended at least one of the events.\n\nWait, no, because the minimum number of students who attended either would be when the two groups (prom and debate) have as much overlap as possible. Because if all the debate participants also went to prom, then the total number attending at least one would be just the number attending prom, which is 90. But that's not possible because the number attending debate is 70, which is less than 90, so all 70 could be part of the 90.\n\nWait, so the maximum overlap would be 70, since there are 70 debate attendees and 90 prom attendees. So the maximum possible overlap is 70. That would mean that the number of students who attended prom or debate is 90 (prom) +70 (debate) -70 (overlap) = 90. So the total number of students who attended at least one is 90. Therefore, the number who didn't attend either would be 200 -90 =110.\n\nWait, but that would mean the maximum number of students who neither attended is 110. But looking at the options, E is 110. But wait, wait, wait, that can't be right because that would imply that only 90 students attended either event, but the problem says that at least 45% attended prom (90) and at least 35% (70) attended debates.\n\nSo if 90 attended prom and 70 attended debates, but all 70 were part of the 90, then the total number of students attending either is 90. So 200-90=110 didn't attend either. So the maximum number who neither attended is 110. But wait, is that correct? Because if 70 are in both, that's allowed. So the maximum number would be 110.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again. If the number of students who attended prom is at least 90, and the number in debates is at least 70, but if all 70 debates are within the 90 prom attendees, then the total number attending at least one is 90. So the maximum number who didn't attend either is 110.\n\nBut wait, the options don't include 110 as the highest. Let me check the options again. Oh, option E is 110. So that would be the maximum number.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes these problems require you to calculate using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. So the minimum number attending either is (prom + debate - both). So to minimize the number attending either, we maximize 'both' as much as possible.\n\nSo the minimum number attending either is when the overlap is as big as possible. The maximum possible overlap is the smaller of the two, which is 70. Because you can't have more overlaps than the smaller set.\n\nSo, the minimum number attending either is 90 (prom) +70 (debate) -70 (max possible overlap) =90.\n\nThus, the maximum number who didn't attend either is 200-90=110. So the answer should be E)110.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. Let me think again. Because sometimes in these problems, the maximum number of students who neither attended is when the two sets have maximum possible overlap. So the minimum number of students attending either is 90 +70 -x, where x is the maximum possible. Wait, but x can't exceed 70 because the debate attendees can't be more than 70. So the minimum number of students in either is 90+70-70=90. So 200-90=110. So the maximum number of students who didn't attend either is 110.\n\nSo the answer is E)110.\n",

Because the total is fixed, so the more you have in either, the less you have in neither. But wait, the problem says 'at least' so the minimum number who attended prom is 45% of 200. Let me calculate that.\n\n45% of 200 is 0.45 * 200 = 90 students. So at least 90 went to prom. Similarly, at least 35% is 0.35 *200=70 students attended the debate.\n\nSo, the minimum number of students who attended prom is 90, and for debate it's 70.\n\nBut wait, if we want to find the maximum number who didn't attend either, we need to consider the overlap between prom and debate attendees. Because some students might have gone to both, so to maximize the number of students who did neither, we should assume as little overlap as possible. Or wait, no, maybe the other way around. Let me think.\n\nWait, the maximum number of students who neither attended prom nor debates would occur when the number of students who attended at least one of the events is as small as possible. Because if more students are in the 'attended at least one' category, that leaves fewer in the neither category.\n\nWait, but the problem says at least 45% attended prom and at least 35% attended debates. So the minimum number in prom is 90, the minimum in debates is 70. But if we add those together, 90 +70=160. But the total number of students is 200, so the maximum possible overlap (so that the total number of students who attended at least one is minimized) would be when the overlap is as large as possible. Because if a lot of students went to both, then the total number of students who attended at least one is 90+70 - overlap. So to minimize that sum, the overlap should be as large as possible.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try another approach. The maximum number of students who neither attended prom nor debates would be the total number of students minus the minimum number of students who attended at least one of the events.\n\nWait, no, because the minimum number of students who attended either would be when the two groups (prom and debate) have as much overlap as possible. Because if all the debate participants also went to prom, then the total number attending at least one would be just the number attending prom, which is 90. But that's not possible because the number attending debate is 70, which is less than 90, so all 70 could be part of the 90.\n\nWait, so the maximum overlap would be 70, since there are 70 debate attendees and 90 prom attendees. So the maximum possible overlap is 70. That would mean that the number of students who attended prom or debate is 90 (prom) +70 (debate) -70 (overlap) = 90. So the total number of students who attended at least one is 90. Therefore, the number who didn't attend either would be 200 -90 =110.\n\nWait, but that would mean the maximum number of students who neither attended is 110. But looking at the options, E is 110. But wait, wait, wait, that can't be right because that would imply that only 90 students attended either event, but the problem says that at least 45% attended prom (90) and at least 35% (70) attended debates.\n\nSo if 90 attended prom and 70 attended debates, but all 70 were part of the 90, then the total number of students attending either is 90. So 200-90=110 didn't attend either. So the maximum number who neither attended is 110. But wait, is that correct? Because if 70 are in both, that's allowed. So the maximum number would be 110.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again. If the number of students who attended prom is at least 90, and the number in debates is at least 70, but if all 70 debates are within the 90 prom attendees, then the total number attending at least one is 90. So the maximum number who didn't attend either is 110.\n\nBut wait, the options don't include 110 as the highest. Let me check the options again. Oh, option E is 110. So that would be the maximum number.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes these problems require you to calculate using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. So the minimum number attending either is (prom + debate - both). So to minimize the number attending either, we maximize 'both' as much as possible.\n\nSo the minimum number attending either is when the overlap is as big as possible. The maximum possible overlap is the smaller of the two, which is 70. Because you can't have more overlaps than the smaller set.\n\nSo, the minimum number attending either is 90 (prom) +70 (debate) -70 (max possible overlap) =90.\n\nThus, the maximum number who didn't attend either is 200-90=110. So the answer should be E)110.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. Let me think again. Because sometimes in these problems, the maximum number of students who neither attended is when the two sets have maximum possible overlap. So the minimum number of students attending either is 90 +70 -x, where x is the maximum possible. Wait, but x can't exceed 70 because the debate attendees can't be more than 70. So the minimum number of students in either is 90+70-70=90. So 200-90=110. So the maximum number of students who didn't attend either is 110.\n\nSo the answer is E)110.\n\n\nTo determine the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session, we start by analyzing the given data:\n\n1. **Total number of students**: 200.\n2. **Minimum number of students who attended the prom**: At least 45% of 200, which is \\( 0.45 \\times 200 = 90 \\).\n3. **Minimum number of students who attended the debating session**: At least 35% of 200, which is \\( 0.35 \\times 200 = 70 \\).\n\nTo maximize the number of students who neither attended the prom nor the debating session, we need to minimize the number of students who attended at least one of the events. This occurs when the overlap between the two groups (students who attended both the prom and the debating session) is as large as possible.\n\nThe maximum possible overlap is limited by the smaller of the two groups, which is 70 (the number of students who attended the debating session). If all 70 students who attended the debating session also attended the prom, the total number of students who attended at least one event is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total students who attended at least one event} = \\text{Prom attendees} + \\text{Debate attendees} - \\text{Overlap} = 90 + 70 - 70 = 90.\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of students who neither attended the prom nor the debating session is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Students who neither attended} = \\text{Total students} - \\text{Students who attended at least one event} = 200 - 90 = 110.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is **110**.\n\nAnswer: E",

At least 45% attended the prom night, and at least 35% took part in the debating session. We need to find the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session. The options are A)27, B)81, C)90, D)99, E)110.\n\nHmm. So, I think this is a problem about sets and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many students attended the prom and how many debated. The problem says at least 45% attended the prom. So, 45% of 200 is... let me calculate that. 45% is 0.45, so 0.45 * 200 = 90 students. So, at least 90 attended prom.\n\nSimilarly, at least 35% took part in the debating session. 35% of 200 is 0.35 * 200 = 70 students. So, at least 70 debated.\n\nNow, the question is about the maximum number of students who neither attended prom nor debated. That's the same as the number of students not in either set. So, to maximize this number, we need to minimize the number of students who are in the union of the two sets (prom attendees and debaters).\n\nWait, how does that work? Oh right, because the more students are in either set, the fewer are left out. So to maximize the number of students who are neither, we need to have as few as possible in the union. But how do we find that?\n\nI remember that the principle of inclusion-exclusion says that the number in the union is equal to the sum of the numbers in each set minus the number in their intersection. So, |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|.\n\nBut since we want to minimize the union, we need to maximize the overlap between A and B. That is, the intersection should be as large as possible because that reduces the total when subtracted.\n\nSo, the maximum possible intersection is the smaller of the two numbers. Wait, let me think. The maximum possible overlap can't exceed the size of either set. So, if set A has 90 and set B has 70, the maximum overlap is 70 because that's the smaller of the two. So, if all 70 debaters were also prom attendees, then the union would be 90 + (70-70) = 90.\n\nWait, no. If all 70 debaters were in the 90 prom attendees, then the union is just 90. So, the union size would be 90, because all debaters are already counted in the prom attendees.\n\nSo, if that's the case, the number of students in either prom or debate is 90. Then, the number of students who neither attended nor debated would be 200 - 90 = 110.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check that. Because the problem states \"at least\" 45% and \"at least\" 35%. So, the numbers could be higher than 90 and 70, respectively.\n\nBut wait, if the numbers are higher, that would mean more students are in either set, which would leave fewer students outside. So, to maximize the number of students who are neither, we want the numbers in each set to be as small as possible.\n\nAh, right! Because if the numbers are higher, the union can be larger, which reduces the number of students who are neither. So, to find the maximum number of students who are neither, we should take the minimum possible numbers for prom and debate attendees. So, exactly 90 attended prom, exactly 70 debated.\n\nSo, the union would be 90 +70 - (their overlap). To minimize the union, we maximize the overlap. The maximum possible overlap is 70, since there are only 70 debaters. So, the union is 90 +70 -70 =90.\n\nSo, the total number in the union is 90. Therefore, the number of students who neither attended prom nor debated is 200 -90=110.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 110 is one of the options (option E). But wait, the problem says \"at least 45%\" and \"at least 35%\". So, those numbers could be higher, but to maximize the number of neither, we need to minimize the number in the union. So, we take the minimum possible attendees for each event.\n\nWait, but another approach: the maximum number of students who could have neither is when as many as possible are excluded from both events. So, we need to minimize the number of students who attended prom, and the number who debated. So, 90 and 70 are the minimums.\n\nSo, the maximum number of students who are in either event is when the overlap is maximum. So, union is 90 +70 - overlap. The maximum overlap possible is 70. So, union is 90.\n\nSo, 200 -90=110. So, the maximum number is 110.\n\nWait, but I'm looking at the options, and option E is 110. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Are there any constraints I'm missing? The problem says \"at least\" 45% and 35%. So, if 45% is the minimum, then the number of prom attendees could be higher, but for our purpose of maximizing the neither group, we take the minimum possible, which is 90.\n\nSimilarly for debate, minimum is 70. So, with these numbers, the maximum overlap is 70, so union is 90. Thus, 200 -90=110.\n\nSo, the answer should be E)110.\n",

Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says that there are 200 students in a school. At least 45% attended the prom night, and at least 35% took part in the debating session. We need to find the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom nor the debate. The options are A)27, B)81, C)90, D)99, E)110.\n\nHmm. So, I think this is a problem about sets and maybe using some principles like the inclusion-exclusion principle. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, let me find out how many students attended the prom and how many participated in the debate. The problem states that at least 45% attended the prom. So, 45% of 200 is 90 students. So, the number of prom attendees is at least 90. Similarly, at least 35% took part in the debate. 35% of 200 is 70 students, so at least 70 attended the debate.\n\nNow, the question is about the maximum number of students who neither attended the prom nor the debate. To maximize this number, we need to minimize the number of students who attended at least one of the two events. Because the more students we have in either event, the fewer are left who didn't attend either.\n\nWait, but how do these two groups (prom and debate) overlap? To minimize the total number of students who went to at least one event, the overlap between the two groups should be as large as possible. Because if many students went to both, then the total unique students attending either event is minimized. That would leave more students who went to neither.\n\nSo, the formula for the union of two sets is: |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|. To minimize |A \u222a B|, we need to maximize |A \u2229 B|, the overlap.\n\nThe minimum possible value for |A \u222a B| is when the overlap is as big as possible. The maximum possible overlap can't exceed the smaller of the two individual sets. Here, |A| is at least 90, |B| at least 70. So the maximum possible overlap is 70, because you can't have more overlapping students than the smaller set. So, if 70 students went to both events, then the total number of students who went to either event is |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B| = 90 + 70 - 70 = 90.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. Because |A| is at least 90, and |B| is at least 70, the maximum possible overlap would be when all of B is included in A. So, if all 70 debate participants also went to the prom, then the total unique students attending either is 90 (since the 70 are already part of the 90 prom-goers). So the union is 90.\n\nBut wait, what if the prom attendees are more than 90? Like, maybe 100 or more. But the problem states \"at least\" 45%, so the minimum is 90, but the actual number could be higher. But since we're trying to find the maximum number of students who didn't attend either, we want to minimize the number who attended at least one. So, to minimize the union, we should take the minimum possible values for |A| and |B|. Because if |A| is larger than 90, that would require more students in the union, which isn't what we want.\n\nSo, taking |A|=90 and |B|=70, with maximum overlap of 70. Then, the union is 90 +70 -70=90.\n\nTherefore, the number of students who attended at least one event is 90. So, the number of students who didn't attend either is 200 - 90 = 110. Wait, but 110 is one of the options, option E. But wait, the options don't include 110 as the maximum? Let me check the options again. Oh, yes, option E is 110.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Because if 90 students went to prom and 70 to debate, and all 70 of the debate are in the 90 prom attendees, then the union is 90. So, 200-90=110 students neither went to prom nor debate. So the maximum possible is 110.\n\nBut wait, is that possible? Because if you have 90 in prom and 70 in debate, but all 70 are in the 90, then that's allowed. So the union is 90, so 110 neither. So the maximum possible number is 110, which is option E.\n\nBut wait, the options given are A)27, B)81, C)90, D)99, E)110.\n\nSo the answer should be E)110.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Did I make a mistake in considering the maximum overlap? Because if the prom attendees are more than 90, say 100, and the debate attendees are 70, then the maximum possible overlap would be 70, so the union would be 100+70-70=100. Then, the number of students who didn't attend either would be 200-100=100, which is less than 110. So that's worse.\n\nSo to maximize the number who didn't attend either, we want the union to be as small as possible. And that's achieved when the union is 90, as computed earlier.\n\nSo, 200-90=110. So, the maximum is 110, which is option E.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought 90 was the minimum number for the union. Let me confirm.\n\nThe formula is |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|. To minimize |A \u222a B|, you need to maximize |A \u2229 B|. The maximum possible |A \u2229 B| is the minimum of |A| and |B|. So if |A| is 90, |B| is 70, then the maximum overlap is 70. So |A \u222a B|=90+70-70=90. So yes, the union can't be smaller than 90, because if |A| is 90 and |B| is 70, and all 70 of B are in A, then the union is 90.\n\nSo the maximum number of students who could have neither is 200-90=110. So the correct answer is E)110.\n\nBut wait, the options have E as 110, so that's the choice. But I'm a bit surprised because I thought the answer might be 90. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe I'm making a mistake in assuming that |A| and |B| are exactly 90 and 70. Because the problem says \"at least\" 45% and \"at least\" 35%, which means |A| could be 90 or higher, and |B| could be 70 or higher.\n\nAh, that's a crucial point. So the minimums are 90 and 70, but the actual numbers could be larger. So, to maximize the number of students who didn't attend either event, we need to minimize the union. So, to minimize the union, we take the smallest possible |A| and |B|, and the maximum possible overlap.\n\nWait, yes. So, if |A|=90 and |B|=70, with maximum overlap of 70, union is 90. So, 200-90=110. If |A| were larger, say 100, and |B|=70, then union is 100 +70 -70=100, so 100. So, the number of students who didn't attend would be 100, which is less than 110. So, to maximize the number of students who didn't attend either, we have to take the minimum possible values for |A| and |B|.\n\nWait, but what if |A| is 90 and |B| is more than 70? Let's say |B|=80. Then, the maximum possible overlap is 90 (since |A|=90). So, |A \u222a B|=90+80-90=80. So, the union is 80, which is smaller than 90. Wait, that can't be right because the union can't be smaller than the size of the larger set. Wait, no, because if |A|=90 and |B|=80, and all 80 of B are in A, then the union is 90. So, in that case, the union is 90, same as before.\n\nWait, but if |B| is larger than |A|, then the maximum overlap is |A|. So, if |A|=90 and |B|=100, then maximum overlap is 90, so |A \u222a B|=90 +100 -90=100. Then, the union is 100, so 200-100=100 students didn't attend either.\n\nSo, in this case, taking |A|=90 and |B|=70 gives the minimal union of 90, leading to the maximum number of students who didn't attend either event.\n\nSo, yes, the maximum possible number is 110. So, option E is correct.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says that there are 200 students in a school. At least 45% attended the prom night, and at least 35% took part in the debating session. We need to find the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom nor the debate. The options are A)27, B)81, C)90, D)99, E)110.\n\nHmm. So, I think this is a problem about sets and maybe using some principles like the inclusion-exclusion principle. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, let me find out how many students attended the prom and how many participated in the debate. The problem states that at least 45% attended the prom. So, 45% of 200 is 90 students. So, the number of prom attendees is at least 90. Similarly, at least 35% took part in the debate. 35% of 200 is 70 students, so at least 70 attended the debate.\n\nNow, the question is about the maximum number of students who neither attended the prom nor the debate. To maximize this number, we need to minimize the number of students who attended at least one of the two events. Because the more students we have in either event, the fewer are left who didn't attend either.\n\nWait, but how do these two groups (prom and debate) overlap? To minimize the total number of students who went to at least one event, the overlap between the two groups should be as large as possible. Because if many students went to both, then the total unique students attending either event is minimized. That would leave more students who went to neither.\n\nSo, the formula for the union of two sets is: |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|. To minimize |A \u222a B|, we need to maximize |A \u2229 B|, the overlap.\n\nThe minimum possible value for |A \u222a B| is when the overlap is as big as possible. The maximum possible overlap can't exceed the smaller of the two individual sets. Here, |A| is at least 90, |B| at least 70. So the maximum possible overlap is 70, because you can't have more overlapping students than the smaller set. So, if 70 students went to both events, then the total number of students who went to either event is |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B| = 90 + 70 - 70 = 90.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. Because |A| is at least 90, and |B| is at least 70, the maximum possible overlap would be when all of B is included in A. So, if all 70 debate participants also went to the prom, then the total unique students attending either is 90 (since the 70 are already part of the 90 prom-goers). So the union is 90.\n\nBut wait, what if the prom attendees are more than 90? Like, maybe 100 or more. But the problem states \"at least\" 45%, so the minimum is 90, but the actual number could be higher. But since we're trying to find the maximum number of students who didn't attend either, we want to minimize the number who attended at least one. So, to minimize the union, we should take the minimum possible values for |A| and |B|. Because if |A| is larger than 90, that would require more students in the union, which isn't what we want.\n\nSo, taking |A|=90 and |B|=70, with maximum overlap of 70. Then, the union is 90 +70 -70=90.\n\nTherefore, the number of students who attended at least one event is 90. So, the number of students who didn't attend either is 200 - 90 = 110. Wait, but 110 is one of the options, option E. But wait, the options don't include 110 as the maximum? Let me check the options again. Oh, yes, option E is 110.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Because if 90 students went to prom and 70 to debate, and all 70 of the debate are in the 90 prom attendees, then the union is 90. So, 200-90=110 students neither went to prom nor debate. So the maximum possible is 110.\n\nBut wait, is that possible? Because if you have 90 in prom and 70 in debate, but all 70 are in the 90, then that's allowed. So the union is 90, so 110 neither. So the maximum possible number is 110, which is option E.\n\nBut wait, the options given are A)27, B)81, C)90, D)99, E)110.\n\nSo the answer should be E)110.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Did I make a mistake in considering the maximum overlap? Because if the prom attendees are more than 90, say 100, and the debate attendees are 70, then the maximum possible overlap would be 70, so the union would be 100+70-70=100. Then, the number of students who didn't attend either would be 200-100=100, which is less than 110. So that's worse.\n\nSo to maximize the number who didn't attend either, we want the union to be as small as possible. And that's achieved when the union is 90, as computed earlier.\n\nSo, 200-90=110. So, the maximum is 110, which is option E.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought 90 was the minimum number for the union. Let me confirm.\n\nThe formula is |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|. To minimize |A \u222a B|, you need to maximize |A \u2229 B|. The maximum possible |A \u2229 B| is the minimum of |A| and |B|. So if |A| is 90, |B| is 70, then the maximum overlap is 70. So |A \u222a B|=90+70-70=90. So yes, the union can't be smaller than 90, because if |A| is 90 and |B| is 70, and all 70 of B are in A, then the union is 90.\n\nSo the maximum number of students who could have neither is 200-90=110. So the correct answer is E)110.\n\nBut wait, the options have E as 110, so that's the choice. But I'm a bit surprised because I thought the answer might be 90. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe I'm making a mistake in assuming that |A| and |B| are exactly 90 and 70. Because the problem says \"at least\" 45% and \"at least\" 35%, which means |A| could be 90 or higher, and |B| could be 70 or higher.\n\nAh, that's a crucial point. So the minimums are 90 and 70, but the actual numbers could be larger. So, to maximize the number of students who didn't attend either event, we need to minimize the union.

So, 200-90=110. If |A| were larger, say 100, and |B|=70, then union is 100 +70 -70=100, so 100. So, the number of students who didn't attend would be 100, which is less than 110. So, to maximize the number of students who didn't attend either, we have to take the minimum possible values for |A| and |B|.\n\nWait, but what if |A| is 90 and |B| is more than 70? Let's say |B|=80. Then, the maximum possible overlap is 90 (since |A|=90). So, |A \u222a B|=90+80-90=80. So, the union is 80, which is smaller than 90. Wait, that can't be right because the union can't be smaller than the size of the larger set. Wait, no, because if |A|=90 and |B|=80, and all 80 of B are in A, then the union is 90. So, in that case, the union is 90, same as before.\n\nWait, but if |B| is larger than |A|, then the maximum overlap is |A|. So, if |A|=90 and |B|=100, then maximum overlap is 90, so |A \u222a B|=90 +100 -90=100. Then, the union is 100, so 200-100=100 students didn't attend either.\n\nSo, in this case, taking |A|=90 and |B|=70 gives the minimal union of 90, leading to the maximum number of students who didn't attend either event.\n\nSo, yes, the maximum possible number is 110. So, option E is correct.\n\n\nTo determine the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session, we analyze the given data:\n\n1. **Total students**: 200  \n2. **Prom night attendees**: At least 45% of 200, which is \\( 0.45 \\times 200 = 90 \\) students.  \n3. **Debating session attendees**: At least 35% of 200, which is \\( 0.35 \\times 200 = 70 \\) students.  \n\nTo maximize the number of students who neither attended the prom nor the debate, we need to minimize the number of students who attended at least one of the two events.
