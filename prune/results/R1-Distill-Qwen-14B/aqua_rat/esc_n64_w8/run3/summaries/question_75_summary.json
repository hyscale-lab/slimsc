      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here about a picket fence. Let me try to understand it step by step. The question is asking for the length of the fence in feet. Hmm, right, so I need to calculate the total length based on the number of pickets and the spaces between them.\n\nThe problem says the fence is straight and has x pickets. Each picket is 1/2 inch wide. Oh wait, and between each pair of pickets, there's 6 inches of space. I remember that when you have multiple items with spaces in between, the number of spaces is usually one less than the number of items. Like, if there are two pickets, there's one space between them.\n\nSo let me break it down. Each picket is 0.5 inches wide. So the total width of all the pickets is x multiplied by 0.5. That makes sense. So x * 0.5 inches.\n\nNow the spaces. Since there are x pickets, the number of spaces between them would be x minus one. Because, like, between each pair, so if x is 3, there are two spaces. So for each space, it's 6 inches. So the total space is (x - 1) * 6 inches.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. If there are x pickets, the number of gaps between them is (x-1). So yeah, that's correct. So the total space is 6*(x-1) inches.\n\nSo the total length of the fence in inches would be the sum of the picket widths and the spaces. So that's (x * 0.5) + (6*(x-1)). \n\nLet me compute that. Let's expand the terms: 0.5x + 6x - 6. Wait, no, wait. 6*(x-1) is 6x -6. So 0.5x plus 6x is 6.5x, right? Because 0.5 +6 is 6.5. So 6.5x minus 6 inches.\n\nWait, but wait again. Let me make sure I'm adding correctly. 0.5x +6x is 6.5x, correct. Then subtract 6. So total length in inches is 6.5x -6 inches.\n\nBut the question asks for the length in feet. Oh right, because 1 foot is 12 inches. So I need to convert inches to feet by dividing by 12.\n\nSo total length in feet is (6.5x -6)/12. Let me compute that. 6.5 is the same as 13/2. So 6.5x is (13/2)x. So substituting, it becomes ( (13/2)x -6 ) /12.\n\nHmm, let me write that as a fraction. So that's (13x/2 -6)/12. Which can be written as (13x/2 -6) multiplied by 1/12. So that's 13x/(2*12) - 6/12. Which simplifies to 13x/24 - 0.5 feet.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, I don't see 13x/24 - 1/2 as an option. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA)13x/2\nB)13x/2 -6\nC)13x/24\nD)(13x+1)/24\nE)(13x-12)/24\n\nWait, none of the options directly match what I have. Hmm. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, let me redo the calculation.\n\nTotal picket width: x * 0.5 inches = 0.5x inches.\n\nNumber of spaces: x-1. Each space 6 inches, so total space is 6(x-1) inches.\n\nTotal length in inches: 0.5x + 6(x-1) = 0.5x +6x -6 = 6.5x -6 inches.\n\nConvert to feet: (6.5x -6)/12 feet. Let's compute this.\n\n6.5 is 13/2, so 13/(2*12) = 13/(24) x. And 6/12 is 0.5. So the expression becomes (13x/24) - (6/12) = (13x/24) - 0.5.\n\nBut none of the options have a subtraction of 0.5. Wait, perhaps I should express everything in fractions with the same denominator.\n\nAlternatively, let's factor the numerator differently. So (6.5x -6) inches is equal to (13x/2 -6) inches. To convert to feet, divide by 12: (13x/2 -6)/12 = (13x -12)/24.\n\nWait, how? Let me see.\n\n(13x/2 -6) is the numerator in inches. To convert to feet, divide by 12.\n\nSo (13x/2 -6) /12 = (13x -12) / 24. Because:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 2 to eliminate the fraction in the numerator.\n\nWait, wait. Let me compute it step by step.\n\n(13x/2 -6) = (13x -12)/2. Because 6 is 12/2, so 13x/2 -12/2 = (13x-12)/2.\n\nSo now, ( (13x-12)/2 ) /12 = (13x-12)/(2*12) = (13x-12)/24.\n\nAh, that's right. So the total length is (13x-12)/24 feet.\n\nLooking back at the options, option E is (13x -12)/24. So the correct answer should be E.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I handle the units correctly? Let me make sure.\n\nEach picket is 0.5 inches, and there are x of them. So 0.5x inches.\n\nSpaces: 6 inches each, and x-1 of them. So 6*(x-1) inches.\n\nTotal length in inches: 0.5x +6(x-1) = 0.5x +6x -6 = 6.5x -6.\n\nConvert to feet: (6.5x -6)/12.\n\n6.5 is 13/2, so 13/(2*12) = 13/24. So 13x/24.\n\nThen the other term is -6/12 = -1/2. So 13x/24 - 1/2.\n\nBut wait, that's not matching any option. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should express 13x/24 - 1/2 as a single fraction.\n\n1/2 is 12/24. So 13x/24 -12/24 = (13x -12)/24.\n\nAh! So that's the same as option E: (13x-12)/24.\n\nSo the correct answer is E.\n",

Let me think about how to approach this. So, the fence is made up of pickets and spaces between them. Since it's a straight fence, each picket is adjacent to the next with a space in between. But wait, how many spaces are there if there are x pickets?\n\nOh right, if you have two pickets, there's one space between them. So for x pickets, the number of spaces should be (x-1). Because the first picket doesn't have a space before it, only between each pair.\n\nEach picket is 1/2 inch wide. So the total width of all the pickets is x multiplied by 1/2 inch.

So total inches = (x/2) + 6x -6.\n\nCombine like terms. Let me convert 6x to halves to add with x/2. 6x is 12x/2, so x/2 +12x/2 =13x/2. Then minus 6.

So total picket length: x*(1/2) = x/2 inches.\n\nNumber of spaces between pickets: x-1. Each space is 6 inches. So spaces total: 6*(x-1) inches.\n\nTotal length in inches: x/2 +6x -6 = (x/2 +6x) -6. 6x is 12x/2, so x/2 +12x/2 =13x/2. So 13x/2 -6 inches.\n\nConvert to feet: (13x/2 -6) /12 = (13x -12)/24. Yes, that's correct.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is (13x-12)/24. So the answer should be E.\n\n\nTo determine the total length of the fence in feet, we start by analyzing the components of the fence. The fence consists of **x pickets**, each 1/2 inch wide, and **6 inches of space between each pair of pickets**. \n\n### Step 1: Total width of the pickets\nEach picket is 1/2 inch wide, so the total width of all pickets is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total picket width} = x \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{x}{2} \\, \\text{inches}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Total width of the spaces\nThere are **(x-1)** spaces between the pickets, as the number of spaces is always one less than the number of pickets. Each space is 6 inches wide, so the total width of the spaces is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total space width} = 6 \\times (x-1) = 6x - 6 \\, \\text{inches}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Total length of the fence in inches\nThe total length of the fence in inches is the sum of the total picket width and the total space width:\n\\[\n\\text{Total length in inches} = \\frac{x}{2} + 6x - 6.\n\\]\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\\[\n\\text{Total length in inches} = \\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{12x}{2} - 6 = \\frac{13x}{2} - 6.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Convert to feet\nSince 1 foot = 12 inches, we divide the total length in inches by 12 to convert it to feet:\n\\[\n\\text{Total length in feet} = \\frac{\\frac{13x}{2} - 6}{12}.\n\\]\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\\[\n\\text{Total length in feet} = \\frac{13x - 12}{24}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Match with the options\nThe expression \\(\\frac{13x - 12}{24}\\) matches **Option E**.\n\nAnswer: E",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a picket fence, and I'm supposed to figure out the length of the fence in feet. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says the fence is straight and made up of x pickets. Each picket is 1/2 inch wide. Between each pair of pickets, there are 6 inches of space. Hmm, I think I need to calculate the total length of the fence based on the number of pickets and the spaces between them.\n\nWait, so each picket is 1/2 inch. If there are x pickets, the total width they take up is x multiplied by 1/2 inch. So that part is straightforward: x * (1/2) inches.\n\nBut then there's the spaces between the pickets. Oh right, the spaces are between each pair, so if there are x pickets, how many spaces are there? I think it's one less than the number of pickets. Like, if you have two pickets, there's one space between them. So for x pickets, it's (x - 1) spaces. Each space is 6 inches, so the total space length is (x - 1) * 6 inches.\n\nSo the total length of the fence in inches is the sum of the picket widths and the spaces. That would be (x * 1/2) + (x - 1) * 6 inches.\n\nLet me write that out as an equation: total inches = (x/2) + 6(x - 1).\n\nWait, let me calculate that. Let's expand 6(x -1) to 6x -6. So the equation becomes (x/2) + 6x -6.\n\nTo combine like terms, I should convert x/2 to a decimal or find a common denominator. Let's see, x/2 is the same as 0.5x, and 6x is 6x. Adding those together: 0.5x + 6x = 6.5x. So the equation is 6.5x -6 inches.\n\nWait, 6.5x minus 6 inches? Hmm, but the answer options are in fractions, so maybe I should keep it in fractions to make it easier to match the options. Let me try that again.\n\n6.5x is the same as 13x/2. Because 6.5 is 13/2. So 6.5x = (13/2)x. So the total inches is (13x/2) -6.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the length in feet. Oh right, because the answer options are in feet. So I need to convert inches to feet. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, I'll divide the total inches by 12.\n\nSo total feet = [(13x/2) -6 ] /12.\n\nLet me compute that. Let's write it as [(13x -12)/2 ] /12. Because I can write 6 as 12/2, so (13x/2 - 6) is (13x -12)/2.\n\nWait, no, actually, 6 is 6/1, so (13x/2 -6) is the same as (13x - 12)/2. Let me see: 13x/2 -6 = (13x -12)/2. Yes, because 6 is 12/2, so subtracting 12/2 from 13x/2 gives (13x -12)/2.\n\nThen, when I divide that by 12 to get feet, it becomes (13x -12)/(2*12) = (13x -12)/24.\n\nSo the total length in feet is (13x -12)/24. Let me check the options.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is (13x -12)/24. So that's the correct one.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of spaces. If there are x pickets, the number of spaces is x-1. So for 2 pickets, 1 space. For 3, 2 spaces. So the calculation for the spaces is correct. Then, the initial total in inches is correct.\n\nConverting to feet: yes, inches divided by 12. So (13x/2 -6) divided by 12. Which is (13x -12)/24.\n\nSo yeah, the answer should be option E.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a picket fence. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question says that there's a straight picket fence made up of x pickets. Each picket is 1/2 inch wide. Between each pair of pickets, there's 6 inches of space. I need to find the total length of the fence in feet. The options are given as A through E, and I have to pick the right one.\n\nHmm. Let's think about this step by step. So, each picket is 0.5 inches wide, right? And the spaces between them are 6 inches each. But wait, how many spaces are there in total?\n\nOh wait, if there are x pickets, the number of spaces between them would be x minus one. Because, like, if you have two pickets, there's one space between them. Three pickets have two spaces, and so on. So the number of spaces is (x-1).\n\nSo the total width taken up by the pickets themselves is x times the width of each picket. Each is 0.5 inches, so that's x * 0.5 inches.\n\nAnd the total space between the pickets is (x-1) spaces, each 6 inches. So that's (x-1) * 6 inches.\n\nSo the total length of the fence in inches would be the sum of the picket widths and the spaces. So that's (x * 0.5) + ( (x-1) * 6 )\n\nLet me write that down as an equation:\n\nTotal length in inches = 0.5x + 6(x - 1)\n\nSimplify that. Let's expand the 6 into the parentheses.\n\n0.5x + 6x -6 = (0.5 +6)x -6 = 6.5x -6 inches.\n\nWait, 6.5 is the same as 13/2. So 6.5x is 13x/2. So the equation becomes:\n\nTotal length = (13x/2) -6 inches.\n\nBut the question asks for the length in feet. Oh right, because 1 foot is 12 inches. So I need to convert inches to feet by dividing by 12.\n\nSo in feet, the total length is [(13x/2) -6 ] /12.\n\nHmm, let me compute that. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, write the numerator as (13x - 12)/2. Because 13x/2 minus 6 is the same as (13x -12)/2.\n\nSo then, [(13x -12)/2 ] divided by 12 is the same as (13x -12)/(2*12) = (13x -12)/24.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is (13x -12)/24. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Number of pickets: x. Each 0.5 inches. So total picket width: 0.5x.\n2. Number of spaces: x-1. Each 6 inches. So total space: 6(x-1).\n3. Total inches: 0.5x +6x -6 = 6.5x -6 inches.\n4. Convert to feet: (6.5x -6)/12 = (13x -12)/24.\n\nYes, that seems right.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a picket fence. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question says that there's a straight picket fence made up of x pickets. Each picket is 1/2 inch wide. Between each pair of pickets, there's 6 inches of space. I need to find the total length of the fence in feet. The options are given as A through E, and I have to pick the right one.\n\nHmm. Let's think about this step by step. So, each picket is 0.5 inches wide, right? And the spaces between them are 6 inches each. But wait, how many spaces are there in total?\n\nOh wait, if there are x pickets, the number of spaces between them would be x minus one. Because, like, if you have two pickets, there's one space between them. Three pickets have two spaces, and so on. So the number of spaces is (x-1).\n\nSo the total width taken up by the pickets themselves is x times the width of each picket. Each is 0.5 inches, so that's x * 0.5 inches.\n\nAnd the total space between the pickets is (x-1) spaces, each 6 inches. So that's (x-1) * 6 inches.\n\nSo the total length of the fence in inches would be the sum of the picket widths and the spaces. So that's (x * 0.5) + ( (x-1) * 6 )\n\nLet me write that down as an equation:\n\nTotal length in inches = 0.5x + 6(x - 1)\n\nSimplify that. Let's expand the 6 into the parentheses.\n\n0.5x + 6x -6 = (0.5 +6)x -6 = 6.5x -6 inches.\n\nWait, 6.5 is the same as 13/2. So 6.5x is 13x/2. So the equation becomes:\n\nTotal length = (13x/2) -6 inches.\n\nBut the question asks for the length in feet. Oh right, because 1 foot is 12 inches. So I need to convert inches to feet by dividing by 12.\n\nSo in feet, the total length is [(13x/2) -6 ] /12.\n\nHmm, let me compute that. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, write the numerator as (13x - 12)/2. Because 13x/2 minus 6 is the same as (13x -12)/2.\n\nSo then, [(13x -12)/2 ] divided by 12 is the same as (13x -12)/(2*12) = (13x -12)/24.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is (13x -12)/24. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Number of pickets: x. Each 0.5 inches. So total picket width: 0.5x.\n2. Number of spaces: x-1. Each 6 inches. So total space: 6(x-1).\n3. Total inches: 0.5x +6x -6 = 6.5x -6 inches.\n4. Convert to feet: (6.5x -6)/12 = (13x -12)/24.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the answer should be E.\n\n\nTo determine the length of the fence in feet, we start by analyzing the components of the fence. Each picket is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\, \\text{inch} \\) wide, and there are \\( x \\) pickets. The total width of the pickets is \\( \\frac{1}{2}x \\, \\text{inches} \\).\n\nBetween each pair of pickets, there is a space of 6 inches. Since there are \\( x \\) pickets, there are \\( x - 1 \\) spaces between them. The total width of the spaces is \\( 6(x - 1) \\, \\text{inches} \\).\n\nThe total length of the fence in inches is the sum of the widths of the pickets and the spaces:\n\\[\n\\text{Total length in inches} = \\frac{1}{2}x + 6(x - 1).\n\\]\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\\[\n\\text{Total length in inches} = \\frac{1}{2}x + 6x - 6 = \\frac{13x}{2} - 6.\n\\]\n\nTo convert the length to feet, divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):\n\\[\n\\text{Total length in feet} = \\frac{\\frac{13x}{2} - 6}{12}.\n\\]\nSimplify the expression:\n\\[\n\\text{Total length in feet} = \\frac{13x - 12}{24}.\n\\]\n\nComparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:\n**E) \\( \\frac{13x - 12}{24} \\).**\n\nAnswer: E",

And between each pair of pickets, there's 6 inches of space. The question is asking for the total length of the fence in feet.\n\nWait, right, the answer needs to be in feet, not inches. So I'll have to convert inches to feet at some point. I remember that 12 inches make a foot, so maybe I'll convert everything to feet or do the calculation in inches and then convert.\n\nLet me think about how the fence is structured. Each picket is 0.5 inches wide. And between each picket, there's a 6-inch space. So for x pickets, how many spaces are there? Oh, right, if there are x pickets, there are (x-1) spaces between them. Because the first picket doesn't have a space before it, only after, and so on until the last picket which doesn't have a space after.\n\nSo the total length contributed by the pickets themselves is the number of pickets times each picket's width. That's x * 0.5 inches.\n\nThen, the total space between pickets is (x-1) spaces multiplied by 6 inches each. So that's 6*(x-1) inches.\n\nAdding these two together gives the total length in inches. So total inches = 0.5x + 6(x-1). Let me compute that. Expanding the second term, 6(x-1) is 6x -6. So total inches = 0.5x +6x -6. Combining like terms: 0.5x +6x is 6.5x, so 6.5x -6 inches.\n\nBut wait, the options are in fractions. 6.5 is the same as 13/2. So 6.5x is 13x/2. So total inches = (13x/2) -6.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the length in feet. So I need to convert inches to feet by dividing by 12. So total feet = (13x/2 -6) /12.\n\nHmm, let me compute that. Dividing each term by 12: (13x/2)/12 is 13x/(2*12) = 13x/24. And 6/12 is 0.5. So the entire expression is (13x/24) - 0.5.\n\nBut wait, none of the options look like that. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOption A:13x/2 \u2192 that's inches, not feet, so probably not. It's too big.\n\nOption B:13x/2 -6 \u2192 that's in inches. Because 13x/2 is 6.5x, minus 6 inches. Then if converted to feet, it's (13x/2 -6)/12. So B is in inches, not feet.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for feet, so the correct answer must be in terms of feet, so the options should be expressions in feet.\n\nLet me re-express (13x/2 -6) inches into feet.\n\nSo (13x/2 -6) inches equals [(13x/2 -6)/12] feet.\n\nWhich is 13x/(2*12) - 6/12 \u2192 13x/24 - 0.5.\n\nHmm, none of the options match that directly. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption E is (13x-12)/24. Let's see: (13x-12)/24 = (13x/24) - (12/24) \u2192 13x/24 - 0.5. Which matches what I have.\n\nWait, so my expression is 13x/24 - 0.5, which is equal to (13x -12)/24 because 0.5 is 12/24. So that would be option E.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nNumber of pickets: x. Each 0.5 inches wide. So total picket length is 0.5x inches.\n\nNumber of spaces: x-1. Each 6 inches. So total space is 6*(x-1) =6x-6 inches.\n\nTotal length in inches: 0.5x +6x -6 =6.5x -6 inches.\n\nConvert to feet: (6.5x -6)/12 = (13x/2 -6)/12.\n\nWhich is equal to 13x/(24) - 6/12 \u2192 13x/24 - 0.5. So 13x/24 - 1/2.\n\nAlternatively, 13x/24 is the same as (13x)/24, and 0.5 is 12/24. So 13x/24 - 12/24 = (13x -12)/24.\n\nWhich is option E: (13x-12)/24.\n\nSo the correct answer should be E.\n",

But wait, how many spaces are there? Oh right, if there are x pickets, the number of spaces between them would be one less than the number of pickets. Like, if you have two pickets, there's one space between them. So for x pickets, it's (x-1) spaces.\n\nSo each picket is 1/2 inch, so the total picket width is x multiplied by 1/2. And each space is 6 inches, so the total space would be (x-1) multiplied by 6.\n\nSo the total length in inches would be (x * 1/2) + ((x -1) *6). Then I need to convert that to feet, since the question asks for feet. Because 1 foot is 12 inches.\n\nLet me calculate that. First, the picket part: x*(1/2) is (x/2) inches. The spaces: (x-1)*6 inches. So total inches is (x/2) + 6(x-1). Let me compute that.\n\nExpand the 6(x-1): 6x -6. So adding x/2 gives (6x + 0.5x) -6 = 6.5x -6 inches. Wait, 6x is 6x, plus x/2 is (12x/2 +x/2) = 13x/2. Oh wait, no. Wait, 6x is 12x/2, so 12x/2 + x/2 is 13x/2. So the total inches would be (13x/2) -6.\n\nBut wait, because 6(x-1) is 6x -6. So the total is (x/2) + (6x -6) = (x/2 +6x) -6. Let me compute x/2 +6x. 6x is 12/2 x. So 12/2 x +1/2 x =13/2 x. So total is (13x/2) -6 inches.\n\nNow, convert inches to feet. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, we divide by 12. So the total length in feet is (13x/2 -6) / 12.\n\nLet me simplify that. (13x/2 -6)/12. Let me write it as (13x -12)/24. Because 13x/2 divided by 12 is (13x)/(2*12) =13x/24. And 6 divided by 12 is 0.5, which is 12/24. So 6/12 is 0.5, which is 12/24. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Let me do it step by step.\n\nWait, (13x/2 -6) is the total in inches. To convert to feet, divide each term by 12.\n\nSo (13x/2) /12 = 13x/(24). And 6/12 is 0.5, which is 1/2, but wait, it's negative 6. So (13x/2 -6) /12 = (13x/2)/12 -6/12 = 13x/(24) - 1/2.\n\nWait, but none of the options seem to exactly match that.

Let me re-examine the initial calculation.\n\nWait, the total inches is (x * 1/2) + (x-1)*6. Which is x/2 +6x -6. So that's (x/2 +6x) is (x/2 + 12x/2) =13x/2. Minus 6. So total inches is (13x/2 -6). Then, converting to feet, divide by 12.\n\nSo (13x/2 -6)/12 = (13x -12)/24. Because 13x/2 divided by 12 is (13x)/(2*12) =13x/24. 6 divided by 12 is 0.5, which is 12/24. So (13x/2 -6) = (13x -12)/2 when you factor out 1/2. Wait, no. Let me compute:\n\n(13x/2 -6) = (13x -12)/2. Because 6 is 12/2.

Wait, 6x is 6x, plus x/2 is (12x/2 +x/2) = 13x/2. Oh wait, no. Wait, 6x is 12x/2, so 12x/2 + x/2 is 13x/2. So the total inches would be (13x/2) -6.\n\nBut wait, because 6(x-1) is 6x -6. So the total is (x/2) + (6x -6) = (x/2 +6x) -6. Let me compute x/2 +6x. 6x is 12/2 x. So 12/2 x +1/2 x =13/2 x. So total is (13x/2) -6 inches.\n\nNow, convert inches to feet. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, we divide by 12. So the total length in feet is (13x/2 -6) / 12.\n\nLet me simplify that. (13x/2 -6)/12. Let me write it as (13x -12)/24. Because 13x/2 divided by 12 is (13x)/(2*12) =13x/24. And 6 divided by 12 is 0.5, which is 12/24. So 6/12 is 0.5, which is 12/24. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Let me do it step by step.\n\nWait, (13x/2 -6) is the total in inches. To convert to feet, divide each term by 12.\n\nSo (13x/2) /12 = 13x/(24). And 6/12 is 0.5, which is 1/2, but wait, it's negative 6. So (13x/2 -6) /12 = (13x/2)/12 -6/12 = 13x/(24) - 1/2.\n\nWait, but none of the options seem to exactly match that. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption A: 13x/2 \u2192 which is the total in inches before subtracting the 6. So that's not it.\n\nOption B: 13x/2 -6 \u2192 that's the total in inches, not feet.\n\nOption C:13x/24 \u2192 that would be if I only converted the picket part, but not the spaces.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the initial calculation.\n\nWait, the total inches is (x * 1/2) + (x-1)*6. Which is x/2 +6x -6. So that's (x/2 +6x) is (x/2 + 12x/2) =13x/2. Minus 6. So total inches is (13x/2 -6). Then, converting to feet, divide by 12.\n\nSo (13x/2 -6)/12 = (13x -12)/24. Because 13x/2 divided by 12 is (13x)/(2*12) =13x/24. 6 divided by 12 is 0.5, which is 12/24. So (13x/2 -6) = (13x -12)/2 when you factor out 1/2. Wait, no. Let me compute:\n\n(13x/2 -6) = (13x -12)/2. Because 6 is 12/2. So 13x/2 -12/2 is (13x -12)/2.\n\nThen, divide by 12: [(13x -12)/2] /12 = (13x -12)/(24).\n\nLooking at the options, option E is (13x -12)/24.\n\nWait, but wait, the options are:\n\nA)13x/2 \u2192 that's inches, not feet.\n\nB)13x/2 -6 \u2192 inches.\n\nC)13x/24 \u2192 would be if only the pickets were converted, but no.\n\nD)(13x+1)/24 \u2192 doesn't match.\n\nE)(13x-12)/24 \u2192 which matches what I got.\n\nSo the answer should be option E.\n\n\nTo determine the length of the fence in feet, we start by calculating the total length in inches. Each picket is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\, \\text{inch} \\) wide, and there are \\( x \\) pickets, so the total width of the pickets is \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\, \\text{inches} \\). Between each pair of pickets, there is \\( 6 \\, \\text{inches} \\) of space. Since there are \\( x \\) pickets, there are \\( x - 1 \\) spaces between them. Thus, the total width of the spaces is \\( 6(x - 1) \\, \\text{inches} \\).\n\nThe total length of the fence in inches is the sum of the widths of the pickets and the spaces:\n\\[\n\\text{Total length in inches} = \\frac{x}{2} + 6(x - 1).\n\\]\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\\[\n\\text{Total length in inches} = \\frac{x}{2} + 6x - 6 = \\frac{13x}{2} - 6.\n\\]\n\nTo convert the total length to feet, divide by \\( 12 \\) (since \\( 1 \\, \\text{foot} = 12 \\, \\text{inches} \\)):\n\\[\n\\text{Total length in feet} = \\frac{\\frac{13x}{2} - 6}{12}.\n\\]\n\nSimplify further:\n\\[\n\\text{Total length in feet} = \\frac{13x - 12}{24}.\n\\]\n\nComparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:\n\\[\n\\text{E) } \\frac{13x - 12}{24}.\n\\]\n\nAnswer: E",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a picket fence. Hmm, I need to find the total length of the fence in feet. Let's see. The question says there are x pickets, each 1/2 inch wide. And between each pair of pickets, there are 6 inches of space. So, I guess I have to calculate the total length contributed by the pickets and the spaces.\n\nWait, let me think. If there are x pickets, how many spaces are there between them? Oh right, if you have x pickets, the number of spaces between them is x-1. Because, like, two pickets have one space between, three pickets have two spaces, etc. So the number of spaces is x-1.\n\nEach picket is 1/2 inch wide. So the total width of all pickets is x multiplied by 1/2 inch. That would be (x * 1/2) inches.\n\nEach space is 6 inches. So the total space is (x-1) multiplied by 6 inches. That's 6*(x-1) inches.\n\nSo the total length in inches is the sum of the picket widths and the spaces. So that's (x/2) + 6*(x-1). Let me write that down: total_length_inches = (x/2) + 6(x-1).\n\nWait, let me compute that. Let's expand the equation. So:\n\nx/2 + 6x - 6. Hmm, combining like terms. Let's convert 6x to halves to add with x/2. 6x is 12x/2. So:\n\nx/2 + 12x/2 = (13x)/2. Then subtract 6: (13x)/2 -6.\n\nWait, so total_length_inches = (13x)/2 -6.\n\nBut the question asks for the length in feet. Oh right, because 1 foot is 12 inches. So I need to convert inches to feet by dividing by 12.\n\nSo, total_length_feet = [(13x/2 -6)] /12.\n\nLet me write that as (13x/2 -6) /12. To combine these terms, I can write them as fractions with a common denominator. Alternatively, I can factor out the denominator.\n\nLet me compute that. Let's see, (13x/2) divided by 12 is (13x)/(2*12) = 13x/24. And 6 divided by 12 is 0.5, or 1/2.\n\nSo, [(13x/2 -6)] /12 = (13x/24) - (6/12) = (13x/24) - (1/2).\n\nWait, but looking at the options, I don't see that exact form. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption A is 13x/2. That's way too big because it's in inches, but the answer needs to be in feet. So A is inches, not feet. So A is not correct.\n\nOption B is 13x/2 -6. That's in inches, because 13x/2 is inches and 6 is inches. So again, not in feet. So B is not the answer.\n\nOption C is 13x/24. That's in feet, because 13x/2 inches would be 13x/(2*12) = 13x/24 feet. Hmm, but wait, our total is 13x/24 minus 6/12, which is 13x/24 - 0.5. None of the options have that.\n\nWait, let me go back. Let me re-calculate the initial step because perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the total length in inches is (x/2) + 6*(x-1). Let me compute that again.\n\nx/2 + 6x -6. Wait, 6x is 6 times x. So x/2 is 0.5x, 6x is 6x. Adding them: 0.5x +6x is 6.5x, which is 13x/2. Then subtract 6. So yes, 13x/2 -6 inches.\n\nNow converting to feet: (13x/2 -6) inches is equal to (13x/2 -6)/12 feet.\n\nLet me write that as (13x/2 -6) divided by 12. Let me split the numerator:\n\n= (13x/2) /12 - 6/12.\n\n= (13x)/(24) - (1/2).\n\nWait, but the options don't have this. Let me look again.\n\nOption E is (13x-12)/24. Let's compute that: (13x-12)/24 = (13x)/24 - 12/24 = (13x)/24 - 0.5. Oh wait, that's the same as what I have. Because my result is (13x/24) - (1/2). Which is same as (13x -12)/24, because 1/2 is 12/24.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me compute that:\n\n(13x/2 -6) /12 = (13x/2 -6) * (1/12) = (13x)/(2*12) -6/12 = 13x/24 - 0.5.\n\nBut 0.5 is 12/24. So 13x/24 - 12/24 = (13x -12)/24.\n\nWhich is exactly option E: (13x-12)/24.\n\nSo that would be the correct answer. Let me check the other options.\n\nOption D: (13x+1)/24. Doesn't match. Option C: 13x/24. That's just the picket part, not considering the spaces. So no. Option E is correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's take a small example. Suppose x=1. Then the fence is just one picket, 0.5 inches, no spaces. So total length is 0.5 inches. Let's plug x=1 into the options.\n\nOption E: (13*1 -12)/24 = (1)/24. That's about 0.0417 feet. 0.0417 *12 inches = ~0.5 inches. Correct.\n\nAnother example: x=2. So two pickets, each 0.5 inches, so 1 inch. One space of 6 inches. Total length is 7 inches, which is 7/12 feet \u22480.5833 ft.\n\nOption E: (13*2 -12)/24 = (26-12)/24 =14/24=7/12 ft. Correct.\n\nAnother example: x=3. 3 pickets: 3 *0.5=1.5 inches. 2 spaces: 2*6=12 inches. Total is 13.5 inches. 13.5 /12=1.125 ft.\n\nOption E: (13*3 -12)/24 = (39-12)/24=27/24=9/8=1.125 ft.
