      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a home appliance store selling microwaves. Hmm, I need to find the average number sold per month over a 22-month period. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says that last year, the store sold an average of 42 microwaves per month. Wait, wait, but I think I need to clarify the time frames here. So last year would be 12 months, right? Because a year has 12 months. So for last year, the average was 42 per month. So the total number sold last year would be 42 multiplied by 12. Let me calculate that: 42 * 12. Hmm, 40*12 is 480, and 2*12 is 24, so 480+24=504. So 504 microwaves sold last year.\n\nThen, this year, in the first 10 months, the average was 20 per month. So for those 10 months, the total sold would be 20 * 10. That's 200. Okay, got that.\n\nSo the total number of microwaves sold over the entire 22 months is the sum of last year and this year's first 10 months. So 504 + 200. Let's add those together. 504 + 200 is 704. So 704 microwaves in total over 22 months.\n\nWait, wait a second. The question is asking for the average per month over the entire 22 months. So I need to take the total number, 704, and divide it by 22 months. Let me do that division: 704 divided by 22.\n\nHmm, let me think. 22 times 30 is 660, right? Because 22 *30=660. Then 704 -660 is 44. 44 divided by 22 is 2. So 30 + 2 is 32. So 32.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check my math again. Because 22 *32 equals 704? Let me calculate 22*30=660, plus 22*2=44. 660+44=704. Yes, that's correct. So the average is 32 per month.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 32. So that's the answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. \n\nWait, another way to check: last year's total is 42*12=504, this year's first 10 months is 20*10=200. Total 704. 704 /22. Let me compute 704 \u00f7 22. 22 goes into 70 three times (22*3=66), remainder 4. Bring down the 4: 44. 22 goes into 44 twice. So 32. Yep, same as before.\n\nSo the average is 32, which is option D. So the correct answer should be D.\n",

Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nSo, last year, the store sold an average of 42 microwaves per month. That's the average for each month of last year. Then, in the first 10 months of this year, their average dropped to 20 per month. The question is asking what the average was over the entire 22-month period. So, that's last year (12 months) plus the first 10 months of this year, making 22 months total.\n\nWait, wait, I should double-check: 12 months last year plus 10 months this year is 22, right? Yeah, 12+10 is 22. So the total time period is 22 months.\n\nSo, to find the average, I think I need to calculate the total number of microwaves sold in those 22 months and then divide by 22.\n\nLet me break it down. Last year, the average was 42 per month. So the total for last year would be 42 multiplied by 12. Let me do that math: 42 *12. Hmm, 40*12 is 480, and 2*12 is 24, so 480+24=504. So 504 microwaves last year.\n\nThen, this year's first 10 months: average of 20 per month. So total is 20*10, which is 200. So 200 microwaves in the first 10 months of this year.\n\nNow, adding those together: 504 + 200 = 704. So total microwaves sold over 22 months is 704.\n\nWait, wait, is that right? Let me recalculate. 42 *12: 42*10 is 420, 42*2 is 84, so 420+84=504. Yep. And 20*10 is 200. So 504 +200 is indeed 704. \n\nSo the total is 704 microwaves over 22 months. The average per month is total divided by number of months. So 704 divided by 22.\n\nHmm, 22 times 30 is 660, because 22*30 is 660. 22*31 is 682, because 22*30=660, plus 22 more is 682. 22*32 would be 682+22=704. Oh! So 22*32 is exactly 704. That makes the average 32 per month.\n\nWait a second, that would mean the average is 32. Let me check: 22 *32= (20*32)+(2*32)= 640 +64=704. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the average is 32. Now, looking at the options, option D is 32. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in adding. 504 +200 is 704. And 704 divided by 22 is 32. Yep.

So, 504 + 200 = 704.\n\nNow, to find the average per month over 22 months, I need to take the total number of microwaves, 704, and divide it by 22. Let me compute that. So, 704 divided by 22.\n\nHmm, let's see. 22 times 30 is 660. Because 22*30=660. Then 704 minus 660 is 44. So, 22 goes into 44 twice. So that's 30 + 2 = 32. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 22 * 32 would be 704? Let me check: 22 * 30 is 660, 22 * 2 is 44. So 660 +44=704. Yes, so 22 *32 =704. So the average is 32.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 32. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Did I calculate everything correctly? Last year: 12 months *42=504. First 10 months: 10*20=200. Total 22 months: 504+200=704. 704 divided by 22 is 32. Yep, that's right. So the answer is D)32.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the average number of microwave ovens sold over a 22-month period. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says that last year, the store sold an average of 42 microwaves per month. So, I think that's for 12 months because a year has 12 months. So, the total number sold last year would be 42 multiplied by 12. Let me calculate that: 42 * 12. Hmm, 40*12 is 480, and 2*12 is 24, so total is 504. Yeah, 42*12=504. So, last year, they sold 504 microwaves.\n\nThen, in the first 10 months of this year, the average was 20 per month. So, the total for those 10 months is 20*10, which is 200. Okay, so 200 microwaves in the first 10 months of this year.\n\nWait, the question is about the entire 22-month period. So that would be last year's 12 months plus this year's 10 months, adding up to 22 months. So, the total microwaves sold in 22 months would be last year's total plus this year's first 10 months' total. So, 504 + 200 = 704.\n\nNow, to find the average per month over 22 months, I need to take the total number of microwaves, 704, and divide it by 22. Let me compute that. So, 704 divided by 22.\n\nHmm, let's see. 22 times 30 is 660. Because 22*30=660. Then 704 minus 660 is 44. So, 22 goes into 44 twice. So that's 30 + 2 = 32. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 22 * 32 would be 704? Let me check: 22 * 30 is 660, 22 * 2 is 44. So 660 +44=704. Yes, so 22 *32 =704. So the average is 32.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 32.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, last year they sold an average of 42 per month. But wait, how many months are we considering here? The problem says \"last year,\" which I assume is 12 months. So, the total number sold last year would be 42 multiplied by 12. Let me do that: 42 * 12. Oh right, 42 times 10 is 420, and 42 times 2 is 84, so adding those gives 504. So 504 microwaves sold last year.\n\nThen, this year, in the first 10 months, the average was 20 per month.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, last year they sold an average of 42 per month. But wait, how many months are we considering here? The problem says \"last year,\" which I assume is 12 months. So, the total number sold last year would be 42 multiplied by 12. Let me do that: 42 * 12. Oh right, 42 times 10 is 420, and 42 times 2 is 84, so adding those gives 504. So 504 microwaves sold last year.\n\nThen, this year, in the first 10 months, the average was 20 per month. So, the total for this period is 20 * 10, which is 200.\n\nWait, but the total period is 22 months. So, last year is 12 months, and this year so far is 10 months, adding up to 22. That makes sense. So the total number of microwaves sold in all 22 months is 504 plus 200. Let me calculate that: 504 + 200 is 704.\n\nNow, to find the average per month over the 22 months, I need to take the total number of microwaves, which is 704, and divide it by 22. Let's do that division: 704 divided by 22.\n\nHmm, I'm trying to figure this out. Let me see, 22 times 30 is 660. Subtract that from 704: 704 - 660 = 44. Then, 44 divided by 22 is 2. So, 30 plus 2 is 32. So, 704 /22 is 32.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check that because sometimes I make mistakes in division. Another way: 22 times 32. Let me calculate that. 20 times 32 is 640, and 2 times 32 is 64. Adding 640 and 64 gives 704. Yes, that's correct. So the average is 32.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 32. So the answer should be D.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the initial steps. Did I compute the totals correctly?\n\nLast year: 12 months * 42 = 504. That's correct because 12 * 40 is 480 and 12 *2 is 24, totaling 504.\n\nThis year's first 10 months: 10 *20 =200. Correct.\n\nTotal microwaves: 504 + 200 =704. Correct.\n\nTotal months: 12 +10=22. Correct.\n\n704 divided by 22: 32. Correct.\n\nSo yeah, the answer should be D)32.\n\n\nTo determine the average number of microwave ovens sold per month over the 22-month period, we calculate the total number of microwaves sold in each period and then find the overall average.\n\n1. **Last Year (12 months):**  \n   The store sold an average of 42 microwaves per month.  \n   Total microwaves sold = \\( 42 \\times 12 = 504 \\).\n\n2. **First 10 Months of This Year:**  \n   The store sold an average of 20 microwaves per month.  \n   Total microwaves sold = \\( 20 \\times 10 = 200 \\).\n\n3. **Total Microwaves Sold Over 22 Months:**  \n   \\( 504 + 200 = 704 \\).\n\n4. **Average Over 22 Months:**  \n   The average is calculated as the total number of microwaves sold divided by the total number of months:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Average} = \\frac{704}{22} = 32\n   \\]\n\nThus, the average number of microwaves sold per month over the 22-month period is **32**.\n\nAnswer: D",

Let me see how I can approach this.\n\nAlright, the problem says that last year, the store sold an average of 42 microwaves per month. Hmm, wait, so that's the average for 12 months, right? Because a year has 12 months. So the total number sold last year would be 42 multiplied by 12. Let me calculate that. 42 times 12... 40*12 is 480, and 2*12 is 24, so adding them gives 504. So they sold 504 microwaves last year.\n\nThen, this year, in the first 10 months, the average was 20 per month. So that's 10 months times 20, which is 200. So they sold 200 microwaves in the first 10 months of this year.\n\nWait, but the question is about the average over the entire 22 months. Oh right, because last year is 12 months plus 10 months this year makes 22. So I need to find the total number sold in all 22 months and then divide by 22.\n\nSo the total sold is 504 (from last year) plus 200 (from this year). Let me add those: 504 + 200 is 704. So total microwaves sold is 704 over 22 months.\n\nNow, to find the average per month, I divide 704 by 22. Hmm, what's 704 divided by 22? Let me think. 22 times 30 is 660. Because 22*30=660. So 704 minus 660 is 44. Then, 44 divided by 22 is 2. So 30 + 2 is 32. So 704/22 = 32. \n\nWait, wait, but that can't be right because 22*32 is 704? Let me check: 22*30=660, 22*2=44. 660+44=704. Yes, that's correct. So the average is 32 per month over the 22 months.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 32. So the answer should be D. But wait, let me double-check if I've considered all the periods correctly. Last year is 12 months, first 10 months this year, so 12+10=22. Yes. And the totals are 504 and 200. 504+200=704. Divided by 22 is 32. So yes, the correct answer is D.\n",

So they sold 200 microwaves in the first 10 months of this year.\n\nWait, but the question is about the average over the entire 22 months. Oh right, because last year is 12 months plus 10 months this year makes 22.
