      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about calculating the total bus fare for a group of people, specifically 4 adults and 3 children. \n\nFirst, I'll read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details. The bus fare for one adult from Ranchi to Patna is Rs. 140. For a child, the fare is half of the adult fare. So I need to find out the cost for 4 adults and 3 children.\n\nHmm, let's break it down. The adult fare is given as Rs. 140. So for one adult, it's straightforward. But since there are 4 adults, I'll multiply the adult fare by 4. That should give me the total for the adults.\n\nWait, calculating the children's fare comes next. Each child's fare is half of the adult's. So for one child, it's 140 divided by 2. Once I have the child fare per person, I'll multiply it by 3 because there are 3 children.\n\nLet me write this down. \n\nAdult fare per person: 140 Rs.\nNumber of adults: 4\nSo, 140 * 4 = 560 Rs. That's for the adults.\n\nChild fare per person: 140 / 2 = 70 Rs.\nNumber of children: 3\nSo, 70 * 3 = 210 Rs. That's for the children.\n\nNow, to find the total fare, I just add the adult fare total and the child fare total together. \n\n560 (adults) + 210 (children) = 770 Rs.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. \n\n140 *4: 140*2 is 280, so 280*2 is 560. That's correct. \n\n140/2 is 70. 70 *3 is 210. Correct.\n\nAdding 560 and 210: 560 + 200 is 760, plus 10 is 770. Yep, that adds up.\n\nNow, looking at the options provided:\nA) 666\nB) 670\nC)700\nD)570\nE)770\n\nSo, the total is 770, which is option E.\n",

Hmm, I remember that the bus fare for an adult is Rs. 140. And the child's fare is half of that, right? So first, I need to find out the child's fare.\n\nWait, let's break it down step by step. The adult fare is Rs. 140. So for a child, it's half of that. Half of 140 is... let me calculate. 140 divided by 2 is 70. Oh, so each child's fare is Rs. 70.\n\nNow, we have 4 adults and 3 children.

So yes, child is 70. 4 adults, 3 children.\n\nWait, could there be a mistake in adding 560 and 210? Let me add them again. 560 + 210. Let me break it down: 500 + 200 is 700, and 60 +10 is 70.

      "full_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So the question is about calculating the total bus fare for 4 adults and 3 children traveling from Ranchi to Patna. Hmm, I remember that the bus fare for an adult is Rs. 140. And the child's fare is half of that, right? So first, I need to find out the child's fare.\n\nWait, let's break it down step by step. The adult fare is Rs. 140. So for a child, it's half of that. Half of 140 is... let me calculate. 140 divided by 2 is 70. Oh, so each child's fare is Rs. 70.\n\nNow, we have 4 adults and 3 children. So I need to calculate the total fare for the adults first. That would be 4 multiplied by 140. Let me do that multiplication. 4 times 140 is 560. Okay, that's Rs. 560 for the adults.\n\nNext, the children's fare. There are 3 children, each paying Rs. 70. So 3 times 70. Hmm, 70 times 3 is 210. So that's Rs. 210 for the children.\n\nNow, to get the total bus fare, I need to add the adult fare and the child fare together. So 560 plus 210 equals... let's see, 560 plus 200 is 760, and then plus 10 is 770. Wait, no, wait, that's not right. Wait, 560 + 210. Let me recalculate. 560 plus 200 is 760, then plus 10 is 770. Oh, so the total is Rs. 770?\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option E is Rs.770. But wait, did I make a mistake? Because the options don't have 770 as the first choice. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nAdult fare: 4 * 140 = 560. Correct. Child fare: 3 * 70 = 210. Correct. 560 +210 is 770. So the total should be 770. But looking at the options, option E is 770. Hmm, but why is option E the last option? Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are A) 666, B)670, C)700, D)570, E)770. So E is the fifth option. So the correct answer should be E.\n\nWait a minute, but wait another thing. Did I read the question correctly? Oh, the bus fare of one adult is Rs. 140, and the child is half of that. So yes, child is 70. 4 adults, 3 children.\n\nWait, could there be a mistake in adding 560 and 210? Let me add them again. 560 + 210. Let me break it down: 500 + 200 is 700, and 60 +10 is 70. So 700 +70 is 770. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo the total bus fare is 770, which is option E. So the answer should be E.\n\n\nThe bus fare for one adult is Rs. 140, and the fare for a child is half of that, which is Rs. 70. To calculate the total fare for 4 adults and 3 children:\n\n1. **Adult fare**:  \n   \\( 4 \\times 140 = 560 \\, \\text{Rs} \\).\n\n2. **Child fare**:  \n   \\( 3 \\times 70 = 210 \\, \\text{Rs} \\).\n\n3. **Total fare**:  \n   \\( 560 + 210 = 770 \\, \\text{Rs} \\).\n\nThus, the total bus fare is Rs. 770, which corresponds to option E.\n\nAnswer: E",

The question is asking for the total fare for 4 adults and 3 children. \n\nAlright, I need to break this down. First, figure out the cost for one adult, which is given as 140.

Child fare would be 140 divided by 2. Let's do that calculation. 140 divided by 2 is 70. So each child pays Rs. 70.\n\nNow, how many adults are there? Four. So, 4 adults times 140 each. Let's calculate that: 4 * 140. Hmm, 4 times 100 is 400, 4 times 40 is 160, so 400+160 is 560. So the total for the adults is 560.\n\nNext, the children. There are 3 children, each paying 70.
