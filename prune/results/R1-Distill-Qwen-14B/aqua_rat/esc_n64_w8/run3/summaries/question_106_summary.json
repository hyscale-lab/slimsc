      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. So, the question is about Mark and John exchanging money, and based on their statements, we need to find out how much money John has. Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let's parse what each person is saying. Mark tells John, \"If you give me half your money, I will have Rs.75.\" So, Mark is saying that if John gives him half of John's current money, then Mark's total money will be 75 rupees. Then, John responds, \"If you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75.\" So, John is saying that if Mark gives him a third of Mark's money, then John's total will be 75 rupees.\n\nWait, so both are making statements about what would happen if they exchange some portion of their money. The goal is to find out how much John has.\n\nLet me denote variables for the amounts. Let's say M is the amount Mark has, and J is the amount John has.\n\nSo, from Mark's statement: If John gives half his money to Mark, Mark will have 75. So, the new amount Mark would have is M + (J/2), and this equals 75. So, equation one is M + (J/2) = 75.\n\nFrom John's statement: If Mark gives one third of his money to John, John will have 75. So, the new amount John would have is J + (M/3), and this equals 75. So, equation two is J + (M/3) = 75.\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n\n1. M + (J/2) = 75\n2. J + (M/3) = 75\n\nI need to solve these two equations to find J, which is John's original amount.\n\nLet me try to solve them. Maybe substitution would work. Let's solve equation 1 for M.\n\nFrom equation 1:\nM = 75 - (J/2)\n\nNow, substitute this into equation 2.\n\nEquation 2 becomes:\nJ + ( (75 - J/2 ) / 3 ) =75\n\nHmm, let's compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, expand the term (75 - J/2)/3. Let's compute that.\n\n(75 - (J/2)) divided by 3 is equal to (75/3) - (J/2)/3 = 25 - (J/6).\n\nSo, equation 2 becomes:\n\nJ + 25 - (J/6) =75\n\nCombine like terms. J minus (J/6) is (6J/6 - J/6) = (5J/6).\n\nSo, equation is now:\n\n25 + (5J/6) =75\n\nSubtract 25 from both sides:\n\n5J/6 = 50\n\nMultiply both sides by 6:\n\n5J = 300\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\nJ =60.\n\nWait, so John has 60 rupees? Let me check the options. Option B is 60. So that's one of the choices.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSo, using J=60, let's see what M is.\n\nFrom equation 1: M =75 - (60/2) =75-30=45. So Mark has 45.\n\nNow, check John's statement. If Mark gives John a third of his money, which is 45/3=15. So John would have 60+15=75. Which matches the condition.\n\nAnd for Mark's statement, if John gives half his money (60/2=30) to Mark, Mark's money becomes 45+30=75. Which also matches.\n\nSo both conditions are satisfied when J=60. Therefore, the correct answer must be B)60.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about.\n\nSo, the question is: Mark told John, \"If you give me half your money, I will have Rs.75.\" Then John says, \"If you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75.\" The question is asking how much money John had. The options are A)22, B)60, C)28, D)26, E)18.\n\nHmm, okay, so Mark and John are exchanging money in two different scenarios, and we need to figure out John's initial amount. Let's break it down.\n\nLet me assign some variables to make this clearer. Let's say Mark has M rupees and John has J rupees. We need to find J.\n\nFirst scenario: John gives half his money to Mark. So, John gives J/2 to Mark. After this transaction, Mark's money becomes M + J/2, and John's money becomes J - J/2 = J/2. According to Mark's statement, after this, Mark will have Rs.75. So, M + J/2 = 75. That's equation one.\n\nSecond scenario: Mark gives one third of his money to John. So, Mark gives M/3 to John. After this, Mark's money is M - M/3 = (2M)/3, and John's money is J + M/3. According to John's statement, after this, John will have Rs.75. So, J + M/3 = 75. That's equation two.\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n\n1) M + (J/2) = 75\n2) J + (M/3) = 75\n\nI need to solve these two equations to find J.\n\nLet me write them again:\n\nEquation 1: M + (J/2) = 75\nEquation 2: J + (M/3) = 75\n\nHmm, maybe I can solve one equation for one variable and substitute into the other. Let's try solving equation 1 for M.\n\nFrom equation 1: M = 75 - (J/2)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for M into equation 2.\n\nEquation 2 becomes:\nJ + ( (75 - (J/2)) / 3 ) = 75\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, expand the substitution:\n\nJ + [ (75 - (J/2) ) / 3 ] = 75\n\nLet me simplify the numerator first. 75 is 75, and J/2 is subtracted from it. So, (75 - J/2) divided by 3.\n\nSo, let's write it as:\n\nJ + (75/3) - (J/2)/3 = 75\n\nWait, 75/3 is 25, and (J/2)/3 is J/(6). So the equation becomes:\n\nJ + 25 - (J/6) = 75\n\nNow, combine like terms. Let's get all terms involving J on one side.\n\nJ - (J/6) = 75 -25\n\nSo, J - J/6 is equal to 50.\n\nLet me compute J - J/6. That's (6J - J)/6 = (5J)/6.\n\nSo, (5J)/6 = 50\n\nMultiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n5J = 300\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\nJ = 60\n\nWait, so J is 60? Let me check that against the options. Option B is 60. Hmm, that seems possible. But wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me plug J=60 back into equation 1 to find M.\n\nFrom equation 1: M = 75 - (60/2) = 75 - 30 = 45.\n\nSo Mark has 45 rupees, and John has 60.\n\nNow, let's test the second scenario. Mark gives John one third of his money.\n\nMark's money is 45, so one third is 15. So John would receive 15, making his total 60 +15 =75. That's correct, which matches John's statement.\n\nWait, but what about the first scenario? If John gives half his money (60/2=30) to Mark, then Mark would have 45+30=75, which is exactly what Mark said. So both scenarios check out.\n\nWait a minute, but the options also include 28, 26, etc. But according to my calculations, J is 60, which is option B. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes in such problems, the initial amount might be different. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equations. Let me re-examine.\n\nIn the first scenario, John gives half his money to Mark. So John's remaining money is J/2, and Mark's becomes M + J/2. According to Mark, his amount after this transaction is 75. So equation 1 is correct: M + J/2 =75.\n\nIn the second scenario, Mark gives one third of his money to John. So Mark's remaining is (2M)/3, and John's becomes J + M/3. John says this equals 75. So equation 2 is J + (M/3) =75. Correct.\n\nSo when I solved, I got J=60. Let me check the options again. Option B is 60. So that must be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but another thought: perhaps I swapped Mark and John's money in the equations. Let me see.\n\nWait, the first scenario: John gives half his money to Mark. So Mark's money becomes M + (J/2) =75. Correct.\n\nSecond scenario: Mark gives one third of his money to John. So John's money becomes J + (M/3) =75. Correct.\n\nSo the equations are right, and the solution is J=60, which is option B.\n",

So the equation becomes:\n\nJ + 25 - (J/6) = 75\n\nNow, combine like terms. Let's get all terms involving J on one side.\n\nJ - (J/6) = 75 -25\n\nSo, J - J/6 is equal to 50.\n\nLet me compute J - J/6.

Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nThe first part says Mark told John, \"If you give me half your money, I will have Rs.75.\" So let's think about that. Let's denote the amount of money John has as J, and Mark's money as M. \n\nSo, if John gives half his money to Mark, John will be left with J/2. Then Mark will have his original amount plus that J/2. So Mark's new amount would be M + (J/2). According to Mark, this new amount for him is Rs.75. So the first equation is:\n\nM + (J/2) = 75.  [Equation 1]\n\nThen John responds, \"If you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75.\" Wait, so now the roles are reversed. Mark is giving one third of his money to John. So Mark gives M/3 to John. So John will then have J + (M/3), and that equals 75. So the second equation is:\n\nJ + (M/3) = 75.  [Equation 2]\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables, M and J.

Hmm, let me read the problem again carefully.\n\nSo, Mark says to John, \"If you give me half your money, I will have Rs.75.\" And John responds, \"If you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75.\" The question is asking how much money John has. The options are A)22, B)60, C)28, D)26, E)18.\n\nWait, wait, I need to model this. Let me think about what each statement implies. Let's denote the variables. Let me call Mark's money as M and John's money as J. So, M is Mark's initial amount, J is John's initial amount.\n\nFirst, Mark says that if John gives him half of John's money, Mark will have Rs.75. So, half of John's money is J/2. If John gives that to Mark, then Mark's new amount is M + J/2, and John's new amount is J - J/2 = J/2. But Mark's statement is about what his own amount will be after that, so M + J/2 = 75. That's equation one.\n\nThen John says, if Mark gives him one third of Mark's money, John will have Rs.75. So, one third of Mark's money is M/3. If Mark gives that to John, then John's new amount is J + M/3, and Mark's new amount is M - M/3 = (2/3)M. But John's statement is about his own amount after that, so J + M/3 =75. That's equation two.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1) M + (J/2) =75  \n2) (J) + (M/3) =75  \n\nWait, no, wait. Let me make sure I got that right. For the second statement, when Mark gives John a third of his money, Mark's amount becomes M - (M/3) = (2M/3), and John's becomes J + (M/3). So the equation is J + (M/3) =75.\n\nSo the two equations are:\n\n1) M + J/2 =75  \n2) J + M/3 =75  \n\nI need to solve these two equations for M and J. Let me write them down again:\n\nEquation 1: M + (J/2) =75  \nEquation 2: J + (M/3) =75  \n\nI can rearrange both equations to express M and J in terms of each other. Let's try to express M from equation 1.\n\nFrom equation 1: M =75 - (J/2)  \nFrom equation 2: J =75 - (M/3)  \n\nHmm, substituting equation 1 into equation 2. Let's plug M from equation 1 into equation 2.\n\nSo, J =75 - [ (75 - J/2) / 3 ].\n\nLet me compute that. Let's compute the term (75 - J/2)/3:\n\n(75 - J/2) divided by 3 is equal to (75/3) - (J/2)/3 =25 - (J/6).\n\nSo J =75 - [25 - (J/6)]  \nSimplify that: J =75 -25 + J/6  \nWhich becomes J=50 + J/6.\n\nHmm, so subtract J/6 from both sides: J - J/6 =50.\n\nJ*(1 - 1/6) =50  \nWhich is J*(5/6) =50  \nMultiply both sides by 6/5: J=50*(6/5)=60.\n\nWait, so J=60. Let me check that.\n\nSo if John has 60, then from equation 1: M +60/2 =75 \u2192 M +30=75 \u2192 M=45.\n\nSo Mark has 45, John has 60.\n\nNow, let's check both conditions.\n\nFirst condition: If John gives half his money to Mark. John's half is 30. So John would have 30 left, and Mark would have 45+30=75. That's correct.\n\nSecond condition: If Mark gives John a third of his money. Mark's third is 15. So John would have 60+15=75. Correct.\n\nSo the calculations seem right. So John has 60, which is option B.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is 60. So the answer should be B.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the variables. Because sometimes when setting up equations, it's easy to swap M and J.\n\nWait, in the problem, Mark tells John that if John gives him half of John's money, Mark will have 75. So Mark's new amount is M + (J/2) =75. Correct.\n\nJohn tells Mark that if Mark gives him one third of Mark's money, John will have 75. So John's new amount is J + (M/3) =75. Correct.\n\nSo the equations are correct, and solving gives J=60, M=45. So John has 60, which is option B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, let's denote Mark's initial amount of money as \\( M \\) and John's initial amount as \\( J \\).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where Mark and John are talking about exchanging money, and I need to figure out how much money John has. Hmm, let me read the problem again carefully.\n\nSo, Mark says to John, \"If you give me half your money, I will have Rs.75.\" And John responds, \"If you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75.\" The question is asking how much money John has. The options are A)22, B)60, C)28, D)26, E)18.\n\nWait, wait, I need to model this. Let me think about what each statement implies. Let's denote the variables. Let me call Mark's money as M and John's money as J. So, M is Mark's initial amount, J is John's initial amount.\n\nFirst, Mark says that if John gives him half of John's money, Mark will have Rs.75. So, half of John's money is J/2. If John gives that to Mark, then Mark's new amount is M + J/2, and John's new amount is J - J/2 = J/2. But Mark's statement is about what his own amount will be after that, so M + J/2 = 75. That's equation one.\n\nThen John says, if Mark gives him one third of Mark's money, John will have Rs.75. So, one third of Mark's money is M/3. If Mark gives that to John, then John's new amount is J + M/3, and Mark's new amount is M - M/3 = (2/3)M. But John's statement is about his own amount after that, so J + M/3 =75. That's equation two.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1) M + (J/2) =75  \n2) (J) + (M/3) =75  \n\nWait, no, wait. Let me make sure I got that right. For the second statement, when Mark gives John a third of his money, Mark's amount becomes M - (M/3) = (2M/3), and John's becomes J + (M/3). So the equation is J + (M/3) =75.\n\nSo the two equations are:\n\n1) M + J/2 =75  \n2) J + M/3 =75  \n\nI need to solve these two equations for M and J. Let me write them down again:\n\nEquation 1: M + (J/2) =75  \nEquation 2: J + (M/3) =75  \n\nI can rearrange both equations to express M and J in terms of each other. Let's try to express M from equation 1.\n\nFrom equation 1: M =75 - (J/2)  \nFrom equation 2: J =75 - (M/3)  \n\nHmm, substituting equation 1 into equation 2. Let's plug M from equation 1 into equation 2.\n\nSo, J =75 - [ (75 - J/2) / 3 ].\n\nLet me compute that. Let's compute the term (75 - J/2)/3:\n\n(75 - J/2) divided by 3 is equal to (75/3) - (J/2)/3 =25 - (J/6).\n\nSo J =75 - [25 - (J/6)]  \nSimplify that: J =75 -25 + J/6  \nWhich becomes J=50 + J/6.\n\nHmm, so subtract J/6 from both sides: J - J/6 =50.\n\nJ*(1 - 1/6) =50  \nWhich is J*(5/6) =50  \nMultiply both sides by 6/5: J=50*(6/5)=60.\n\nWait, so J=60. Let me check that.\n\nSo if John has 60, then from equation 1: M +60/2 =75 \u2192 M +30=75 \u2192 M=45.\n\nSo Mark has 45, John has 60.\n\nNow, let's check both conditions.\n\nFirst condition: If John gives half his money to Mark. John's half is 30. So John would have 30 left, and Mark would have 45+30=75. That's correct.\n\nSecond condition: If Mark gives John a third of his money. Mark's third is 15. So John would have 60+15=75. Correct.\n\nSo the calculations seem right. So John has 60, which is option B.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is 60. So the answer should be B.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the variables. Because sometimes when setting up equations, it's easy to swap M and J.\n\nWait, in the problem, Mark tells John that if John gives him half of John's money, Mark will have 75. So Mark's new amount is M + (J/2) =75. Correct.\n\nJohn tells Mark that if Mark gives him one third of Mark's money, John will have 75. So John's new amount is J + (M/3) =75. Correct.\n\nSo the equations are correct, and solving gives J=60, M=45. So John has 60, which is option B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let's denote Mark's initial amount of money as \\( M \\) and John's initial amount as \\( J \\). The problem provides two conditions:\n\n1. **Mark's statement**: If John gives Mark half of his money, Mark will have Rs. 75.
