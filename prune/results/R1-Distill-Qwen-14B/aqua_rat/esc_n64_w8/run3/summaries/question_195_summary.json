Hmm, let's think about this.\n\nThe bells ring every 36 seconds, 40 seconds, and 48 seconds respectively. They all start ringing together at a certain time, and I need to find the next time they all ring together. Oh right, this sounds like a problem involving the least common multiple, or LCM. Because the LCM of their intervals would give the next time they all coincide.\n\nWait, but how do I calculate the LCM of three numbers? I remember that LCM of multiple numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of each of them. So I need to find the LCM of 36, 40, and 48.\n\nLet me break each number down into its prime factors to find the LCM. \n\nStarting with 36. 36 divided by 2 is 18, divided by 2 again is 9.

So 48 is 2^4 * 3^1.\n\nTo find the LCM, I take the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations. So for 2, the highest power is 2^4 from 48. For 3, it's 3^2 from 36. And for 5, it's 5^1 from 40.\n\nSo LCM = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5^1. Let's compute that.\n\n2^4 is 16, 3^2 is 9, and 5 is 5. So 16 * 9 is 144. Then 144 *5 is 720.

So the bells will ring together again after 12 minutes.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 12 minutes. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check.

So, I need to find the smallest time that is a multiple of all three. That makes sense because the bells will ring together again only when the time elapsed is a multiple of each of their intervals.\n\nRight, so the key is to find the LCM of 36, 40, and 48. How do I do that? I remember that LCM can be found by prime factorization. Let me break each number down into primes.\n\nStarting with 36: 36 divided by 2 is 18, divided by 2 again is 9. 9 is 3 squared. So, 36 is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3\u00b2.\n\nNext, 40: 40 divided by 2 is 20, again by 2 is 10, and again by 2 is 5.

So the answer should be B.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the LCM calculation. Another way to think about it is to list the multiples, but that might take longer.\n\nAlternative approach: Find LCM of 36 and 40 first, then take that result and find LCM with 48.\n\nLet me try that. \n\nWhat's the LCM of 36 and 40?\n\n36 factors: 2\u00b2 *3\u00b2\n40 factors: 2\u00b3 *5\nSo the LCM is max exponents: 2\u00b3, 3\u00b2,5. So 8 *9 *5= 360. Wait, 8*9 is 72, times 5 is 360. So LCM of 36 and 40 is 360.\n\nNow, find LCM of 360 and 48.\n\nFactorizing 360: 360 is 2\u00b3 * 3\u00b2 *5\u00b9.\n\nFactorizing 48: 2\u2074 *3\u00b9.\n\nSo the LCM is max exponents: 2\u2074, 3\u00b2,5\u00b9. Which is 16*9*5= 720. Yep, same as before.\n\nSo 720 seconds is 12 minutes. So option B is correct.\n\nWait, but what if I miscalculated the exponents? Let me check each number again.\n\n36: 2\u00b2*3\u00b2 (since 2*2=4, 3*3=9; 4*9=36)\n40: 2^3 *5 (2*2*2=8, 8*5=40)\n48: 2^4 *3 (2*2*2*2=16, 16*3=48)\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother way, maybe using the formula: LCM(a,b,c) = LCM(LCM(a,b),c). So we did that.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the multiples:\n\nLooking for the first time after 0 when all three coincide.\n\nBut that's tedious.

So 40 is 2^3 * 5^1.\n\n48 seconds: 48 divided by 2 is 24, then 12, then 6, then 3. So 48 is 2^4 * 3^1.\n\nNow, to find the LCM, I take the highest power of each prime number present in the factorizations.\n\nPrimes involved are 2, 3, and 5.\n\nFor 2: the highest exponent is 4 (from 48).\nFor 3: the highest exponent is 2 (from 36).\nFor 5: the highest exponent is 1 (from 40).\n\nSo LCM = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5^1.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n2^4 is 16.\n3^2 is 9.\n5^1 is 5.\n\nMultiply them together: 16 * 9 = 144, then 144 *5 = 720.\n\nSo the LCM is 720 seconds.\n\nWait, the question asks when they ring together again, so 720 seconds after the start. But the options are given in minutes. Let me convert 720 seconds to minutes.\n\nSince 1 minute is 60 seconds, 720 divided by 60 is 12. So 720 seconds is 12 minutes.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA) 6 minutes \u2192 360 seconds. No, that's less than 720.\nB)12 minutes \u2192 720. That's the one.\nC)18 \u2192 1080, too big.\nD)24 \u2192 way bigger.\nE) none. Well, since B is an option, E isn't needed.\n\nSo the correct answer should be B, after 12 minutes.\n\n\nTo determine when the three bells will ring together again, we calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of their intervals: 36 seconds, 40 seconds, and 48 seconds. \n\nFirst, we factorize each interval into its prime factors:\n- **36 seconds**: \\( 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\)\n- **40 seconds**: \\( 2^3 \\times 5^1 \\)\n- **48 seconds**: \\( 2^4 \\times 3^1 \\)\n\nThe LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime number present in the factorizations:\n- For \\( 2 \\): the highest power is \\( 2^4 \\) (from 48 seconds).\n- For \\( 3 \\): the highest power is \\( 3^2 \\) (from 36 seconds).\n- For \\( 5 \\): the highest power is \\( 5^1 \\) (from 40 seconds).\n\nThus, the LCM is:\n\\[\n\\text{LCM} = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1 = 16 \\times 9 \\times 5 = 720 \\text{ seconds}.\n\\]\n\nConverting 720 seconds to minutes:\n\\[\n720 \\div 60 = 12 \\text{ minutes}.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the bells will ring together again after **12 minutes**. Among the given options, the correct answer is:\n\n**B) After 12 minutes**\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem where three bells are ringing at different intervals: 36 seconds, 40 seconds, and 48 seconds. They all start ringing together at a certain time, and I need to find out after how long they'll ring together again. Hmm, I think this has something to do with finding a common multiple of their intervals. \n\nWait, right, when things happen at intervals, the next time they coincide is the least common multiple (LCM) of their intervals. So I need to calculate the LCM of 36, 40, and 48. \n\nLet me break it down. I remember that to find the LCM, it's helpful to factor each number into its prime factors. \n\nStarting with 36: 36 divided by 2 is 18, divided by 2 again is 9. 9 is 3 squared. So 36 is 2\u00b2 * 3\u00b2.\n\nNext, 40: 40 divided by 2 is 20, divided by 2 is 10, divided by 2 is 5, which is prime. So 40 is 2\u00b3 * 5\u00b9.\n\nThen, 48: 48 divided by 2 is 24, divided by 2 is 12, divided by 2 is 6, divided by 2 is 3. So that's 2\u2074 * 3\u00b9.\n\nNow, for LCM, I take the highest power of each prime number present. So for 2, the highest exponent is 4 (from 48). For 3, the highest is 2 (from 36). And for 5, it's 1 (from 40). \n\nSo the LCM is 2\u2074 * 3\u00b2 *5\u00b9. Let me calculate that. \n\n2\u2074 is 16. 3\u00b2 is 9. 5 is 5. Multiply them together: 16 * 9 = 144. Then 144 *5 is 720. So the LCM is 720 seconds.\n\nWait, but the options are given in minutes. I need to convert 720 seconds into minutes. Since 1 minute is 60 seconds, I'll divide 720 by 60. 720 /60 =12. So 12 minutes. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is 12 minutes.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem where three bells are ringing at different intervals: 36 seconds, 40 seconds, and 48 seconds. They all start ringing together at a certain time, and I need to find out after how long they'll ring together again. Hmm, I think this has something to do with finding a common multiple of their intervals. \n\nWait, right, when things happen at intervals, the next time they coincide is the least common multiple (LCM) of their intervals. So I need to calculate the LCM of 36, 40, and 48. \n\nLet me break it down. I remember that to find the LCM, it's helpful to factor each number into its prime factors. \n\nStarting with 36: 36 divided by 2 is 18, divided by 2 again is 9. 9 is 3 squared. So 36 is 2\u00b2 * 3\u00b2.\n\nNext, 40: 40 divided by 2 is 20, divided by 2 is 10, divided by 2 is 5, which is prime. So 40 is 2\u00b3 * 5\u00b9.\n\nThen, 48: 48 divided by 2 is 24, divided by 2 is 12, divided by 2 is 6, divided by 2 is 3. So that's 2\u2074 * 3\u00b9.\n\nNow, for LCM, I take the highest power of each prime number present. So for 2, the highest exponent is 4 (from 48). For 3, the highest is 2 (from 36). And for 5, it's 1 (from 40). \n\nSo the LCM is 2\u2074 * 3\u00b2 *5\u00b9. Let me calculate that. \n\n2\u2074 is 16. 3\u00b2 is 9. 5 is 5. Multiply them together: 16 * 9 = 144. Then 144 *5 is 720. So the LCM is 720 seconds.\n\nWait, but the options are given in minutes. I need to convert 720 seconds into minutes. Since 1 minute is 60 seconds, I'll divide 720 by 60. 720 /60 =12. So 12 minutes. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is 12 minutes. So the answer should be B. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. \n\nLet me recount the factors. 36 is 2\u00b2*3\u00b2, correct. 40 is 2\u00b3*5, yes. 48 is 2\u2074*3.
