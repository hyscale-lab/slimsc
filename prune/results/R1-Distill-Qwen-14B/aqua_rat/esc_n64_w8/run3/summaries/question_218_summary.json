      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem where when 2272 and 875 are divided by a three-digit number N, they leave the same remainder. I need to find the sum of the digits of N, and the options are given as A to E. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nWait, when two numbers are divided by the same divisor and leave the same remainder, that means the difference between those two numbers should be divisible by that divisor, right? Because the remainders are the same, so subtracting them would eliminate the remainder part, leaving a multiple of the divisor.\n\nSo, the difference between 2272 and 875 is 2272 - 875. Let me calculate that. 2272 minus 800 is 1472, then minus 75 is 1397. So, 1397. So N must be a divisor of 1397.\n\nBut wait, N is a three-digit number. So I need to find all the three-digit divisors of 1397 and see which one fits the conditions.\n\nFirst, I should factorize 1397 to find its divisors. Let's see, 1397 divided by small primes. Let me try dividing by 11: 11 * 127 is 1397? Wait, 11*127 is 1397? Let me check 127 * 10 is 1270, plus 127 is 1397, yes. So 1397 factors into 11 and 127. Are those primes?\n\nWait, 127 is a prime number, right? Yes, because it's not divisible by 2,3,5,7,11. Let's check: 127 divided by 7 is about 18.14, not an integer. So yes, 127 is prime. So the factors of 1397 are 1, 11, 127, and 1397.\n\nWait, but N is a three-digit number. So the possible N's are 11, 127, and 1397? Wait no, wait. Wait, 11 is a two-digit number, so it's not a three-digit. 127 is a three-digit number. 1397 is a four-digit number. So the only three-digit divisor is 127. So N must be 127?\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, wait a second. Let me make sure. Because 1397 is 11*127. So the possible divisors are 1, 11, 127, 1397. So N is a three-digit number, so the only possibility is 127. So N is 127.\n\nNow, the sum of the digits of N is 1 + 2 +7 = 10. Wait, but 10 is option A. But wait, wait, let me double-check if I did everything right.\n\nWait, the problem says when you divide 2272 and 875 by N, the same remainder is left. So let's verify that 127 is indeed the correct N.\n\nSo 2272 divided by 127. Let's compute 127 * 17 is 2159 (because 127*10=1270, 127*7=889, 1270+889=2159). 2272 minus 2159 is 113. So remainder is 113.\n\nNow, 875 divided by 127. Let's see: 127*6=762. 875-762=113. So the remainder is also 113. So yes, same remainder. So N is 127.\n\nSum of digits: 1 +2 +7=10. So the answer should be option A)10.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, the options are A)10, B)11, etc. So the correct answer is A.\n\nBut wait, wait a minute. Wait, did I miss any other possible three-digit divisors? Because 1397 is 11*127, so the only three-digit is 127. So no, that's the only one.\n\nSo the sum of digits is 1+2+7=10.

I need to find the sum of the digits of N, and the options are A)10, B)11, C)12, D)13, E)14.\n\nHmm, I remember that when two numbers leave the same remainder when divided by another number, there's a relationship between them. I think it's something like the difference between the two numbers is a multiple of the divisor. Let me think. Oh right, if a number A leaves a remainder R when divided by N, and another number B leaves the same remainder R when divided by N, then (A - B) should be divisible by N. So N must be a divisor of (A - B).\n\nSo in this case, A is 2272 and B is 875. Let me subtract them: 2272 - 875 equals... let's see, 2272 minus 800 is 1472, minus 75 more is 1397. So N must be a divisor of 1397.\n\nWait, but N is a 3-digit number. So I need to find all 3-digit divisors of 1397 and then find which one has the sum of digits matching one of the options.\n\nFirst, I should factorize 1397 to find all its divisors. Let me try dividing 1397 by small primes. Is it even? No, because it ends with 7. So not divisible by 2. Let's try 3: 1+3+9+7=20, which isn't divisible by 3. Next, 5: ends with 7, so no. Next, 7: Let me check. 7 times 199 is 1393. 1397 minus 1393 is 4, so 1397 divided by 7 is 199 with a remainder of 4. So 7 isn't a factor.\n\nHow about 11? Let's apply the divisibility rule for 11. Subtract the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the even positions. For 1397: (1 + 9) - (3 +7) = (10) - (10) = 0. Oh, since 0 is divisible by 11, 1397 is divisible by 11. So 1397 \u00f711.

Wait, no: 11 is a two-digit number, so that's too small. 127 is a 3-digit number, right? Wait, 127 is a three-digit number? No, wait, 127 is 1-2-7, which is three digits. Wait no, 127 is three digits? No, wait, 127 is three digits because it's 1 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 7 (units). So 127 is a 3-digit number.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I'm dividing two numbers, 2272 and 875, by a three-digit number N, and both give the same remainder. I need to find the sum of the digits of N. The options are from A to E, with the sums being 10, 11, 12, 13, or 14.\n\nHmm, let me think. I remember that when two numbers are divided by the same divisor and leave the same remainder, the difference between those two numbers should be divisible by that divisor. So, the key here is to subtract the two numbers and find their difference. That difference should be a multiple of N.\n\nLet me calculate the difference. 2272 minus 875. Let's see, 2272 minus 800 is 1472, then minus 75 more would be 1472 -75= 1397. Wait, wait, wait. Let me do it more accurately: 2272 - 875. 2272 - 800 is 1472, then subtract 75: 1472-75=1397. So the difference is 1397.\n\nSo N must be a divisor of 1397. But N is a three-digit number. So I need to find all the three-digit divisors of 1397.\n\nWait, but first, I should factorize 1397 to find its divisors. Let me try to find the prime factors of 1397.\n\nI'll start by checking small primes. Is 1397 even? No. Sum of digits is 1+3+9+7=20, which isn't divisible by 3. So 3 doesn't divide it. Next, 5? It ends with 7, so no. How about 7? Let me try 1397 divided by 7. 7 into 13 is 1, 7*1=7, 13-7=6. Bring down 9: 69. 7*9=63, remainder 6. Bring down 7: 67. 7*9=63 again, remainder 4. So 7 doesn't divide it.\n\nNext, 11. The rule for 11 is alternating sum. (1 + 9) - (3 +7) = (10) - (10) =0. Oh, so 1397 is divisible by 11. Let me check that. 11 times what is 1397.\n\n11 * 127 = 1397? Let's see: 11*120=1320, 11*7=77. 1320+77=1397. Yes! So 1397 = 11 * 127.\n\nWait, is 127 a prime? Let me think. 127 is a well-known prime number, I believe. So the factors of 1397 are 1, 11, 127, and 1397.\n\nSo the possible three-digit divisors of 1397 are 127 and 11*127=1397, but wait, 1397 is a four-digit number, so the only three-digit divisor is 127. Because 127 is a three-digit number? Wait, 127 is 1-2-7, which is three digits, yes. So N must be 127.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me make sure. Because N is a three-digit number, and the difference is 1397, which factors into 11 and 127. So the possible N's are 11 and 127, but 11 is a two-digit number, so only 127 is the three-digit divisor.\n\nSo N is 127. Now, the sum of its digits is 1 + 2 +7=10. But wait, the options have 10 as option A. But let me double-check because I might have made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the problem says that when 2272 and 875 are divided by N, they leave the same remainder. So, let me confirm that 2272 mod 127 is equal to 875 mod 127.\n\nLet me compute 2272 divided by 127. 127 * 17 = 2159 (because 127*10=1270, 127*7=889; 1270+889=2159). 2272 - 2159 = 113. So the remainder is 113.\n\nNow, 875 divided by 127. Let's see: 127*6=762. 875 - 762=113. So the remainder is 113. So yes, both give the same remainder.

I'm a bit confused because the sum is 10, which is option A. But let me think again about the divisors. Are there any other three-digit divisors of 1397? Because if 1397 is 11 * 127, and 11 is a prime, then 127 is another prime, so there are no other factors except 1, 11, 127, and 1397.\n\nSo 127 is the only three-digit divisor. So N must be 127.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. What if N is a three-digit number that doesn't divide 1397 exactly but leaves the same remainder when dividing both 2272 and 875? Because sometimes, when you subtract, you get a number that's a multiple of N, but perhaps N could be a divisor of the difference or something else.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. When two numbers a and b are divided by N, leaving the same remainder r, then (a - r) is divisible by N, and (b - r) is also divisible by N. So (a - b) is also divisible by N because (a - r) - (b - r) = a - b. So N must be a divisor of (a - b), which is 1397.\n\nSo N must be a three-digit divisor of 1397. As we saw, 1397's factors are 1, 11, 127, 1397. So only 127 is a three-digit number. So N is 127.\n\nSo the sum of the digits is 1+2+7=10. So the correct option is A)10.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where I'm dividing two numbers, 2272 and 875, by a three-digit number N, and both give the same remainder. I need to find the sum of the digits of N. The options are from A to E, with the sums being 10, 11, 12, 13, or 14.\n\nHmm, let me think. I remember that when two numbers are divided by the same divisor and leave the same remainder, the difference between those two numbers should be divisible by that divisor. So, the key here is to subtract the two numbers and find their difference. That difference should be a multiple of N.\n\nLet me calculate the difference. 2272 minus 875. Let's see, 2272 minus 800 is 1472, then minus 75 more would be 1472 -75= 1397. Wait, wait, wait. Let me do it more accurately: 2272 - 875. 2272 - 800 is 1472, then subtract 75: 1472-75=1397. So the difference is 1397.\n\nSo N must be a divisor of 1397. But N is a three-digit number. So I need to find all the three-digit divisors of 1397.\n\nWait, but first, I should factorize 1397 to find its divisors. Let me try to find the prime factors of 1397.\n\nI'll start by checking small primes. Is 1397 even? No. Sum of digits is 1+3+9+7=20, which isn't divisible by 3. So 3 doesn't divide it. Next, 5? It ends with 7, so no. How about 7? Let me try 1397 divided by 7. 7 into 13 is 1, 7*1=7, 13-7=6. Bring down 9: 69. 7*9=63, remainder 6. Bring down 7: 67. 7*9=63 again, remainder 4. So 7 doesn't divide it.\n\nNext, 11. The rule for 11 is alternating sum. (1 + 9) - (3 +7) = (10) - (10) =0. Oh, so 1397 is divisible by 11. Let me check that. 11 times what is 1397.\n\n11 * 127 = 1397? Let's see: 11*120=1320, 11*7=77. 1320+77=1397. Yes! So 1397 = 11 * 127.\n\nWait, is 127 a prime? Let me think. 127 is a well-known prime number, I believe. So the factors of 1397 are 1, 11, 127, and 1397.\n\nSo the possible three-digit divisors of 1397 are 127 and 11*127=1397, but wait, 1397 is a four-digit number, so the only three-digit divisor is 127. Because 127 is a three-digit number? Wait, 127 is 1-2-7, which is three digits, yes. So N must be 127.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me make sure. Because N is a three-digit number, and the difference is 1397, which factors into 11 and 127. So the possible N's are 11 and 127, but 11 is a two-digit number, so only 127 is the three-digit divisor.\n\nSo N is 127. Now, the sum of its digits is 1 + 2 +7=10. But wait, the options have 10 as option A. But let me double-check because I might have made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the problem says that when 2272 and 875 are divided by N, they leave the same remainder. So, let me confirm that 2272 mod 127 is equal to 875 mod 127.\n\nLet me compute 2272 divided by 127. 127 * 17 = 2159 (because 127*10=1270, 127*7=889; 1270+889=2159). 2272 - 2159 = 113. So the remainder is 113.\n\nNow, 875 divided by 127. Let's see: 127*6=762. 875 - 762=113. So the remainder is 113. So yes, both give the same remainder. So N is 127.\n\nSo the sum of the digits is 1+2+7=10. So the answer should be option A)10.\n\nWait, but the options given are:\n\nA)10\n\nB)11\n\nC)12\n\nD)13\n\nE)14\n\nSo the correct answer is A)10.\n\nWait, but wait a second. I'm a bit confused because the sum is 10, which is option A. But let me think again about the divisors. Are there any other three-digit divisors of 1397? Because if 1397 is 11 * 127, and 11 is a prime, then 127 is another prime, so there are no other factors except 1, 11, 127, and 1397.\n\nSo 127 is the only three-digit divisor. So N must be 127.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. What if N is a three-digit number that doesn't divide 1397 exactly but leaves the same remainder when dividing both 2272 and 875? Because sometimes, when you subtract, you get a number that's a multiple of N, but perhaps N could be a divisor of the difference or something else.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. When two numbers a and b are divided by N, leaving the same remainder r, then (a - r) is divisible by N, and (b - r) is also divisible by N. So (a - b) is also divisible by N because (a - r) - (b - r) = a - b. So N must be a divisor of (a - b), which is 1397.\n\nSo N must be a three-digit divisor of 1397. As we saw, 1397's factors are 1, 11, 127, 1397. So only 127 is a three-digit number. So N is 127.\n\nSo the sum of the digits is 1+2+7=10. So the correct option is A)10.\n\n\nWhen dividing 2272 and 875 by a three-digit number \\( N \\), both leave the same remainder. This implies that \\( N \\) must divide the difference of the two numbers, \\( 2272 - 875 = 1397 \\). \n\nTo find \\( N \\), factorize 1397.

Hmm, the question says that when 2272 and 875 are divided by a 3-digit number N, they leave the same remainder. I need to find the sum of the digits of N, and the options are from 10 to 14.\n\nWait, okay, so both divisions give the same remainder. That means when we subtract those two numbers, the difference should be a multiple of N. Because if two numbers leave the same remainder when divided by N, their difference is exactly divisible by N. Oh right, that's a thing I remember from math.\n\nSo, let me write this down. Let's say when 2272 is divided by N, the quotient is q1 and remainder r. Similarly, when 875 is divided by N, the quotient is q2 and same remainder r. So, 2272 = N*q1 + r and 875 = N*q2 + r. Subtracting these two equations gives 2272 - 875 = N*(q1 - q2). So, 2272 - 875 = 1397, right?\n\nWait, 2272 minus 875. Let me compute that. 2272 minus 800 is 1472, then minus 75 more is 1397. Yes. So 1397 must be divisible by N.

Then, among those, which one would satisfy the condition that when 2272 and 875 are divided by N, they leave the same remainder.\n\nWait, but 1397 divided by N is an integer. So N must be a factor of 1397. So I need to factorize 1397 to find its divisors.\n\nLet me try to factorize 1397. Hmm, 1397. Let's see if it's divisible by small primes. Divided by 2? No, it's odd. Divided by 3? Sum of digits is 1+3+9+7=20. 20 isn't divisible by 3, so no. Divided by 5? Ends with 7, so no. Next, 7. Let's check 7: 1397 divided by 7.\n\n7 * 199 is 1393, because 7*200=1400, so 1400-7=1393. 1397-1393=4, so remainder 4. So no, not divisible by 7.\n\nNext, 11. The rule for 11 is alternating sum: (1 +9) - (3 +7) = (10) - (10) =0. Oh, so 1397 is divisible by 11. Let me check: 11 * 127 = 1397? Let's compute 127 *11. 127*10=1270, plus 127 is 1397. Yes, so 1397=11 *127.\n\nSo the factors of 1397 are 1, 11, 127, and 1397. But N is a 3-digit number, so N must be either 127 or 11. Wait, 11 is a two-digit number, so the only 3-digit divisor is 127. Wait, but wait, 127 is a 3-digit number? 1, 2, 7\u2014 yes, three digits.\n\nWait, no. 127 is a three-digit number. 11 is two-digit, 127 is three-digit, and 1397 is four-digit, so N must be 127.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. Are there any other factors? Because 127 is a prime number, right? Let me confirm that. 127: is it a prime? Let's check divisibility by primes up to sqrt(127) which is around 11. So 2,3,5,7,11. 127 divided by 2 is 63.5, not integer. 3: 127/3 is 42.333, no. 5: ends with 7, so no. 7: 127/7 is around 18.14, not integer. 11: 127/11 is about 11.54, nope. So yes, 127 is prime. So the only 3-digit divisor is 127. So N must be 127.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure that when 2272 and 875 are divided by 127, they leave the same remainder. Because sometimes, the logic is correct, but perhaps there's an oversight.\n\nSo let me compute 2272 divided by 127. Let's find how many times 127 goes into 2272.\n\n127 * 17 is 2159 (since 127 *10=1270, 127*7=889; 1270+889=2159). 2272 -2159=113. So the remainder is 113.\n\nNow, 875 divided by 127: Let's see. 127*6=762. 875-762=113. So remainder is 113. So yes, both give same remainder. So N is 127.\n\nWait, but the question is about the sum of the digits of N. N is 127, so digits are 1, 2, 7. Sum is 1+2+7=10. So the answer would be 10.

Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that if two numbers leave the same remainder when divided by N, then their difference should be a multiple of N.

But N is a three-digit number, so I need to find all three-digit divisors of 1397 and see which one fits the conditions.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me confirm: 2272 mod N = remainder R, and 875 mod N = same R. So 2272 - 875 = 1397, which must be exactly divisible by N. So N is a divisor of 1397.\n\nSo first, I should factorize 1397 to find its divisors. Let's try to factor 1397. Hmm.\n\nI'll start by checking if it's even: 1397 is odd, so not divisible by 2. Next, sum of digits: 1+3+9+7 = 20, which isn't divisible by 3, so 3 isn't a factor. Let's try 5: ends with 7, so no. Next, 7. Let me do 1397 divided by 7.\n\n7*199 is 1393, which is 4 less than 1397. So 1397-1393 is 4, so 1397 is 7*199 +4, so not divisible by 7. Hmm.\n\nHow about 11? Let's test for 11. The rule is to subtract and add digits alternately. So 1 -3 +9 -7 = 1 -3 is -2, plus9 is 7, minus7 is 0. Oh, so it's divisible by 11. So 1397 divided by 11 is... let's compute that.\n\n11 times 127 is 1397? Wait, let's see: 11*120=1320, 11*7=77. 1320+77=1397. Yes! So 1397 = 11 * 127.\n\nWait, but 127 is a prime number, right? Because it's not divisible by 2,3,5,7,11. Let me check: 127 divided by 2? No, it's odd. 3: 1+2+7=10, not divisible by 3. 5: ends with 7, no. 7: 7*18 is 126, so 127-126=1, not divisible. 11: 11*11=121, 127-121=6, not divisible. So yes, 127 is prime.\n\nSo the prime factors of 1397 are 11 and 127. So the divisors are 1, 11, 127, and 1397. But N is a three-digit number, so possible N candidates are 127 and 11. Wait, 11 is two-digit, so only 127 is a three-digit divisor. But wait, 1397 is a four-digit number, so that's beyond three digits. So the only three-digit divisor is 127.\n\nWait, but 127 is a three-digit number, right? 1, 2, 7: yes, 127 is a three-digit number. So N must be 127.\n\nThen the sum of the digits of N is 1 + 2 + 7 = 10. Hmm, looking at the options, option A is 10. So the answer would be A.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Let me make sure that when 2272 and 875 are divided by 127, they indeed leave the same remainder.\n\nSo let's compute 2272 divided by 127.\n\n127*17 is 2159 (because 127*10=1270, 127*7=889; 1270+889=2159). 2272 - 2159 = 113. So the remainder is 113.\n\nWait, but 127*18 is 2286, which is higher than 2272. So 17*127=2159, so 2272-2159=113.\n\nNow, 875 divided by 127. Let's see: 127*6=762. 875-762=113. So yes, the remainder is 113 in both cases.\n\nSo N is 127, and the sum of its digits is 1+2+7=10. So option A)10 is correct.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, option A is 10. So the answer is A.\n",

I need to find the sum of the digits of N, and the options are given from A to E.\n\nHmm, right. So, when two numbers are divided by the same divisor and leave the same remainder, that means their difference is exactly divisible by that divisor. Oh wait, right! Because if two numbers a and b, when divided by N, leave the same remainder r, then a = q1*N + r and b = q2*N + r. Subtracting them gives a - b = (q1 - q2)*N. So N must be a divisor of (a - b).\n\nSo in this case, a is 2272 and b is 875. Let me compute the difference: 2272 minus 875. Let's do the math. 2272 minus 800 is 1472, then minus 75 is 1397.

Let's try 11: 1 -3 +9 -7 = (1+9) - (3+7) = 10 -10 =0. Oh, that's a multiple of 11. So 1397 \u00f711 is... let me compute. 11 \u00d7 127 is 1397? Wait, 11\u00d7120=1320, 11\u00d77=77, so 1320+77=1397. So yes, 1397 = 11 \u00d7 127. Wait, but is 127 a prime? Let me check.\n\n127: it's a well-known prime, I think. Let me see, square root is around 11.27. So testing primes up to 11. 127 \u00f72 no, \u00f73: 1+2+7=10, not divisible by 3. \u00f75 no. \u00f77: 7\u00d718=126, 127-126=1. Not divisible. \u00f711: 11\u00d711=121, 127-121=6. Not divisible. So yes, 127 is prime.\n\nSo the factors of 1397 are 1, 11, 127, and 1397. But wait, N is a three-digit number, so possible candidates are 11 and 127. Wait, 11 is two digits, so the only three-digit divisor is 127. Oh wait, wait. 127 is a three-digit number? No, 127 is a three-digit number. Wait, 127 is 1-2-7, yes, three digits. Wait, 127 is 127, which is a three-digit number.\n\nSo N could be 127. Are there any other three-digit divisors? Let me think. 1397 is 11 \u00d7127. So the other factors are 1, 11, 127, 1397. So only 127 is a three-digit number.\n\nWait, but wait a second. What about N=127. Let me check if 2272 and 875 when divided by 127 leave the same remainder.\n\nLet me compute 2272 \u00f7127. Let's see, 127 \u00d717 is 2159 (since 127\u00d710=1270, \u00d77=889; 1270+889=2159). 2272 -2159 = 113. So the remainder is 113.\n\nNow, 875 \u00f7127. Let's see, 127 \u00d76=762. 875 -762=113. So remainder is 113. Oh, same remainder. So N=127 is correct.\n\nSo the sum of the digits of N is 1 + 2 +7 =10. Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 10. But wait, wait. Let me double-check. 1+2+7 is indeed 10.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Are there any other three-digit numbers that divide 1397? Because I thought N has to be a three-digit divisor of 1397. But 1397 is 11 \u00d7127. So the only three-digit factor is 127. So N must be 127.\n\nSo the sum of its digits is 1+2+7=10. So the correct answer is A)10.\n\nWait, but wait the options are A)10, B)11, etc. So according to this, A is correct. But I'm a bit confused because in the options, 10 is option A, which is the correct sum.\n\nSo the answer should be A)10.\n",
