      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this probability problem to solve. Let me read it again and understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question is about two numbers being relatively prime, which means their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1. So, if I pick two numbers, they shouldn't share any common factors except 1. But wait, in this case, the set S contains numbers from 1 to 1,000 inclusive. The question is asking for the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000.\n\nWait, so I'm choosing just one number from S, and I need to find the probability that this number is relatively prime to 1,000. Right, because the question is about the probability for a single number.\n\nSo, the probability would be the number of integers between 1 and 1000 that are relatively prime to 1000, divided by the total number of integers in S, which is 1000.\n\nSo the first step is to find how many numbers in S are coprime with 1000.\n\nI remember that the count of numbers less than or equal to a number n that are coprime to n is given by Euler's Totient function, denoted as \u03c6(n). So \u03c6(1000) will give me the count I need.\n\nNow, I need to compute \u03c6(1000). To do that, I should factorize 1000 into its prime factors. Let me think. 1000 is 10 cubed, which is (2*5)^3. So 1000 = 2^3 * 5^3.\n\nEuler's Totient function for a number n = p1^k1 * p2^k2 * ... * pn^kn is calculated as n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pn).\n\nSo applying that to 1000, which is 2^3 *5^3, \u03c6(1000) = 1000 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/5) = 1000 * (1/2) * (4/5).\n\nLet me calculate that. 1000 * 1/2 is 500. Then 500 * 4/5 is (500 *4)/5 = 2000/5 = 400. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 500 * (4/5) is 400. So \u03c6(1000) is 400. So there are 400 numbers between 1 and 1000 that are coprime to 1000.\n\nSo the probability is 400 / 1000, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations. 1000 * (1/2) is 500. Then 500 * (4/5) is 500 * 0.8 = 400. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the probability is 400/1000, which simplifies by dividing numerator and denominator by 200, giving 2/5. So the probability is 2/5.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 2/5. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait a second, wait, let me think again. Did I calculate \u03c6(1000) correctly?\n\nAnother way to compute \u03c6(n) when n is the product of two primes is n*(1-1/p)*(1-1/q). Since 1000 is 2^3 *5^3, \u03c6(1000) = 1000*(1-1/2)*(1-1/5) = 1000 * (1/2) * (4/5) = 1000 * (2/5) * (4/5) ?\n\nWait, no, 1/2 *4/5 is (4/10)=2/5. So 1000 * 2/5 = 400. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the number of coprimes is 400. So 400/1000 is 2/5. So the probability is 2/5. So the correct option is D.\n",

The question says that two numbers are relatively prime if they share no common positive factors other than 1. Set S contains integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive. I need to find the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000. The options are A through E, with various fractions.\n\nWait, probability is the number of favorable outcomes over the total possible outcomes. So the total numbers here are 1000, since S includes all integers from 1 to 1000. So the denominator in the probability will be 1000. The numerator is the count of numbers in S that are relatively prime to 1000.\n\nBut how do I find how many numbers are relatively prime to 1000? Oh, right, I remember something called Euler's Totient Function, \u03c6(n), which gives the number of integers less than or equal to n that are coprime to n. So \u03c6(1000) should give me the count I need.\n\nWait, but how does the Totient Function work again? I think it's based on the prime factors of the number. Let me factorize 1000. 1000 is 10 cubed, which is (2*5)^3, so 2^3 *5^3. So the prime factors are 2 and 5.\n\nThe formula for Euler's Totient Function when the number is a product of prime powers is \u03c6(n) = n * product of (1 - 1/p) for each distinct prime p dividing n. So for 1000, which is 2^3 *5^3, the distinct primes are 2 and 5.\n\nSo \u03c6(1000) = 1000 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/5). Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 1 - 1/2 is 1/2, and 1 - 1/5 is 4/5.

Hmm, I remember that two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1. So the question is asking, out of all numbers from 1 to 1000, what's the chance that a randomly picked number shares no common factors with 1000 except 1.\n\nWait, right, probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by total possible outcomes. The total possible outcomes here are 1000 because the set S has numbers from 1 to 1000. So the denominator in my probability calculation will be 1000.\n\nNow, the numerator is the count of numbers in S that are coprime with 1000. How do I find that? Oh, right, this is where Euler's Totient Function comes into play. Euler's Totient Function, \u03c6(n), gives the number of integers less than or equal to n that are coprime to n.\n\nSo I need to compute \u03c6(1000). Let me think about how to calculate that. I remember that if the prime factorization of n is known, \u03c6(n) can be calculated using the formula: \u03c6(n) = n * product of (1 - 1/p) for each distinct prime p dividing n.\n\nFirst, I'll factorize 1000. 1000 is 10 cubed, which is (2 * 5)^3. So the prime factors are 2 and 5. Therefore, 1000 = 2^3 * 5^3.\n\nUsing the formula, \u03c6(1000) = 1000 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/5). Let me compute that step by step.\n\n1 - 1/2 is 1/2, and 1 - 1/5 is 4/5. Multiplying these together: (1/2) * (4/5) = 4/10 = 2/5. So \u03c6(1000) = 1000 * (2/5) = 400. Wait, wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, 1000 multiplied by 2/5 is 400. But wait, 1000 * 2/5 is 400? Let me check: 1000 divided by 5 is 200, multiplied by 2 is 400. Yes, that's correct. So \u03c6(1000) is 400.\n\nSo there are 400 numbers between 1 and 1000 that are relatively prime to 1000. Therefore, the probability is 400/1000. Simplifying that, I can divide numerator and denominator by 200, which gives 2/5. Wait, 400 divided by 1000 is 0.4, which is 2/5. So the probability is 2/5.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 2/5. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I compute \u03c6(1000) correctly? Let me double-check. 1000 is 2^3 * 5^3. So \u03c6(1000) = 1000 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/5) = 1000 * (1/2) * (4/5) = 1000 * (2/5) = 400. Yep, that's right. So the count is 400. So 400/1000 is 2/5, which is 0.4.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the numbers that are coprime to 1000 are those not divisible by 2 or 5.

But the probability of being divisible by both 2 and 5 (i.e., 10) is 1/10. So using inclusion-exclusion, the probability of being divisible by 2 or 5 is (1/2 + 1/5) - (1/10) = (5/10 + 2/10) - 1/10 = (7/10) - 1/10 = 6/10 = 3/5.\n\nSo the probability of not being divisible by 2 or 5 is 1 - 3/5 = 2/5.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the probability that a number chosen from the set S (which includes integers from 1 to 1000) is relatively prime to 1000. Hmm, I remember that two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1. So the question is asking, out of all numbers from 1 to 1000, what's the chance that a randomly picked number shares no common factors with 1000 except 1.\n\nWait, right, probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by total possible outcomes. The total possible outcomes here are 1000 because the set S has numbers from 1 to 1000. So the denominator in my probability calculation will be 1000.\n\nNow, the numerator is the count of numbers in S that are coprime with 1000. How do I find that? Oh, right, this is where Euler's Totient Function comes into play. Euler's Totient Function, \u03c6(n), gives the number of integers less than or equal to n that are coprime to n.\n\nSo I need to compute \u03c6(1000). Let me think about how to calculate that. I remember that if the prime factorization of n is known, \u03c6(n) can be calculated using the formula: \u03c6(n) = n * product of (1 - 1/p) for each distinct prime p dividing n.\n\nFirst, I'll factorize 1000. 1000 is 10 cubed, which is (2 * 5)^3. So the prime factors are 2 and 5. Therefore, 1000 = 2^3 * 5^3.\n\nUsing the formula, \u03c6(1000) = 1000 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/5). Let me compute that step by step.\n\n1 - 1/2 is 1/2, and 1 - 1/5 is 4/5. Multiplying these together: (1/2) * (4/5) = 4/10 = 2/5. So \u03c6(1000) = 1000 * (2/5) = 400. Wait, wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, 1000 multiplied by 2/5 is 400. But wait, 1000 * 2/5 is 400? Let me check: 1000 divided by 5 is 200, multiplied by 2 is 400. Yes, that's correct. So \u03c6(1000) is 400.\n\nSo there are 400 numbers between 1 and 1000 that are relatively prime to 1000. Therefore, the probability is 400/1000. Simplifying that, I can divide numerator and denominator by 200, which gives 2/5. Wait, 400 divided by 1000 is 0.4, which is 2/5.

So the probability is 1 minus the probability of being divisible by 2 or 5.\n\nBut inclusion-exclusion comes into play there. The probability of being divisible by 2 is 1/2, by 5 is 1/5.

The question says that two numbers are relatively prime if they share no common positive factors other than 1. So, I remember that the term \"relatively prime\" basically means their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1.\n\nThe set S contains integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive. So, there are 1,000 numbers in total. The question is asking for the probability that a randomly chosen number from S is relatively prime to 1,000. Probability is usually the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcomes are the numbers in S that are relatively prime to 1,000.

Once I have that count, I can divide it by 1000 to get the probability.\n\nI remember that the number of integers less than or equal to a number N that are coprime to N is given by Euler's Totient Function, often denoted as \u03c6(N). So, \u03c6(1000) will give me the count I need.\n\nNow, how do I compute \u03c6(1000)? I think it's related to the prime factors of 1000. Let me factorize 1000. 1000 is 10 cubed, which is (2 * 5)^3, so 2^3 * 5^3. So, the prime factors are 2 and 5.\n\nEuler's Totient Function formula for a number N = p1^k1 * p2^k2 * ... * pn^kn is N * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pn). So, applying that here.\n\nSo, \u03c6(1000) = 1000 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/5). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 1 - 1/2 is 1/2. Then, 1 - 1/5 is 4/5. Multiply those together: 1/2 * 4/5 = 4/10 = 2/5. So, 1000 * (2/5) = 400. Wait, wait, wait, 1000 * 2/5 is 400? Let me check that calculation again. 1000 * (1/2) is 500, then 500 * (4/5) is 400. Oh, right, that's correct.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about probability and relatively prime numbers. Hmm, let's try to break it down. The question says that two numbers are relatively prime if they share no common positive factors other than 1. So, I remember that the term \"relatively prime\" basically means their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1.\n\nThe set S contains integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive. So, there are 1,000 numbers in total. The question is asking for the probability that a randomly chosen number from S is relatively prime to 1,000. Probability is usually the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcomes are the numbers in S that are relatively prime to 1,000. The total outcomes are 1,000.\n\nWait, so I need to find how many numbers between 1 and 1000 are coprime with 1000. Once I have that count, I can divide it by 1000 to get the probability.\n\nI remember that the number of integers less than or equal to a number N that are coprime to N is given by Euler's Totient Function, often denoted as \u03c6(N). So, \u03c6(1000) will give me the count I need.\n\nNow, how do I compute \u03c6(1000)? I think it's related to the prime factors of 1000. Let me factorize 1000. 1000 is 10 cubed, which is (2 * 5)^3, so 2^3 * 5^3. So, the prime factors are 2 and 5.\n\nEuler's Totient Function formula for a number N = p1^k1 * p2^k2 * ... * pn^kn is N * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pn). So, applying that here.\n\nSo, \u03c6(1000) = 1000 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/5). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 1 - 1/2 is 1/2. Then, 1 - 1/5 is 4/5. Multiply those together: 1/2 * 4/5 = 4/10 = 2/5. So, 1000 * (2/5) = 400. Wait, wait, wait, 1000 * 2/5 is 400? Let me check that calculation again. 1000 * (1/2) is 500, then 500 * (4/5) is 400. Oh, right, that's correct. So \u03c6(1000) is 400.\n\nSo, there are 400 numbers between 1 and 1000 that are relatively prime to 1000. Therefore, the probability is 400 / 1000, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nWait, but the options are given, and option D is 2/5. So that should be the correct answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, wait, let me think again. Did I compute \u03c6(1000) correctly? 1000 is 2^3 * 5^3. So, yes, using the formula, (2^3 - 2^2) * (5^3 -5^2) ? Or is that another approach? No, the totient function for a number N with prime factors p and q is N*(1-1/p)*(1-1/q). So, yes, 1000 * (1/2) * (4/5) equals 400. So that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is inclusion-exclusion. The numbers not coprime with 1000 are those divisible by 2 or 5.

Alternatively, using inclusion-exclusion.\n\nAnother approach: the count of numbers from 1 to 1000 that are not divisible by 2 or 5.\n\nTotal numbers:1000.\n\nNumbers divisible by 2: 1000/2 =500.\n\nNumbers divisible by 5: 1000/5=200.\n\nNumbers divisible by both 2 and 5 (which is 10): 1000/10=100.\n\nSo using inclusion-exclusion, the numbers divisible by 2 or 5 are (500 +200 -100) =600.\n\nSo numbers not divisible by 2 or 5 would be 1000 -600 =400. Yep, same as before. So \u03c6(1000)=400.\n\nSo the probability is 400/1000 = 0.4. Which is 2/5. Wait, 400 divided by 1000 is 0.4, which is 2/5.\n\nWait, but wait. The options are given. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA)5/7\nB)3/5\nC)4/7\nD)2/5\nE)2/7\n\nSo 2/5 is option D.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Because the question is about numbers from 1 to 1000 inclusive, but \u03c6(n) counts numbers from 1 to n that are coprime with n. So in this case, yes, \u03c6(1000) is 400, so the probability is 400/1000 = 2/5. So the answer is D.\n\nBut let me think if there's any possibility I made a mistake. For example, sometimes, when the number is 1, it's coprime with every number, including 1000. So 1 is included in the count. But since 1000 is 2^3*5^3, any number not divisible by 2 or 5 is coprime. So the count is correct.\n\nWait another point: 1000 is included in the set S. Is 1000 coprime with itself? No, because 1000 shares factors 2 and 5 with itself. So 1000 is not included in the count of coprimes. So the count is 400, which includes numbers from 1 to 999 that are coprimes, but wait, wait. Wait, no, \u03c6(1000) counts numbers from 1 to 1000 inclusive that are coprimes. So 1000 is not coprime with itself, but the count is 400, which includes 1 to 1000.\n\nWait, wait, no. Euler's totient function \u03c6(n) counts the number of integers less than or equal to n that are coprime to n. So yes, 1 is included, but 1000 is not coprime with itself. So \u03c6(1000)=400 includes numbers from 1 to 999 that are coprime with 1000, plus 1000 if it's coprime, but since it's not, it's 400 numbers.\n\nSo the probability is 400/1000, which is 2/5. So the answer is D.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Another approach: using the formula for probability when selecting a number uniformly at random. The probability that a number is coprime to n is equal to the product over all distinct prime factors of (1 - 1/p). So for n=1000, which has prime factors 2 and 5.\n\nSo the probability is (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/5) = (1/2) * (4/5) = 4/10 = 2/5. So yes, 2/5.\n\nSo the correct option is D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nThe question is about finding the probability that a randomly chosen number from the set S (which includes integers from 1 to 1000) is relatively prime to 1000. Relatively prime means that the two numbers share no common positive factors other than 1. So, I need to find how many numbers in S are coprime with 1000 and then divide that by the total number of elements in S to get the probability.\n\nFirst, the total number of elements in set S is 1000, right? So that's straightforward.\n\nNow, the main task is to find how many numbers between 1 and 1000 are coprime with 1000. I remember that Euler's Totient Function, \u03c6(n), gives the number of integers less than or equal to n that are coprime with n. So \u03c6(1000) should give me the numerator I need.\n\nWait, but how do I compute \u03c6(1000)? I think it's done by prime factorization. Let me factorize 1000. 1000 is 10^3, which is (2 *5)^3. So 1000 = 2^3 * 5^3. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nEuler's Totient Function formula for a number n = p^a * q^b * r^c ... is n multiplied by (1 - 1/p) * (1 - 1/q) * (1 - 1/r) etc. So applying that here.\n\nSo \u03c6(1000) = 1000 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/5). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 1 - 1/2 is 1/2, and 1 - 1/5 is 4/5. So multiplying those together: 1/2 * 4/5 = 4/10 = 2/5. Then multiply by 1000: 1000 * (2/5) = 400. Wait, that can't be right because 1000 is 1000, and 2/5 of that is 400. So \u03c6(1000) is 400?\n\nWait, wait. Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check that. Oh, no, wait: 1000 * (1/2) is 500, and 500 * (4/5) is 400. Yep, that's correct. So \u03c6(1000) is 400.

Let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nThe question says that two numbers are relatively prime if they share no common positive factors other than 1. So, set S contains integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive. I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen number from S is relatively prime to 1,000.\n\nHmm, probability is usually the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. Here, the total possible outcomes are 1,000 since the set S includes every number from 1 to 1000.\n\nSo, the favorable outcomes are the numbers in S that are relatively prime to 1000. That means I need to count how many numbers between 1 and 1000 don't share any common factors with 1000 except 1.\n\nWait, 1000 is a specific number. Let me factorize 1000 to find its prime factors. 1000 is 10 cubed, which is (2*5)^3. So, 2^3 * 5^3. So, the prime factors are 2 and 5.\n\nTherefore, any number that doesn't have 2 or 5 as a factor will be relatively prime to 1000. So, I need to count how many numbers between 1 and 1000 are not divisible by 2 or 5.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of numbers that are divisible by 2 or 5 and subtract that from the total to find those that are coprime with 1000.\n\nWait, using the inclusion-exclusion principle might help here. The inclusion-exclusion principle says that the number of elements in the union of two sets is equal to the sum of the sizes of the sets minus the size of their intersection.\n\nSo, the count of numbers divisible by 2 or 5 is equal to (numbers divisible by 2) + (numbers divisible by 5) - (numbers divisible by both 2 and 5).\n\nLet me compute each part.\n\nNumbers divisible by 2 from 1-1000: That's every even number. So 1000 / 2 = 500 numbers.\n\nNumbers divisible by 5: 1000 /5 = 200.\n\nNumbers divisible by both 2 and 5: That's numbers divisible by their least common multiple, which is 10. So 1000 /10 = 100.\n\nSo, using inclusion-exclusion: 500 + 200 - 100 = 600.\n\nWait, so 600 numbers are divisible by 2 or 5. So, the numbers not divisible by either would be 1000 - 600 = 400.\n\nSo, there are 400 numbers between 1 and 1000 that are relatively prime to 1000.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 400 / 1000 = 0.4. Wait, 0.4 is equal to 2/5, right? Hmm, but wait, 400 is 40% of 1000, which is 0.4. So the probability is 400/1000 = 2/5.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 2/5. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I remember something about Euler's Totient Function. Oh right, Euler's totient function \u03c6(n) gives the count of numbers less than n that are coprime to n.\n\nSo, for n=1000, \u03c6(1000) should be equal to the number of integers from 1 to 1000 that are coprime with 1000. Let me compute \u03c6(1000).\n\nSince 1000 = 2^3 * 5^3, \u03c6(1000) = 1000 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/5) = 1000 * (1/2) * (4/5) = 1000 * (2/5) = 400.\n\nWait, that's the same as before.

So the correct answer is option D, which is 2/5.\n\nWait a minute, but looking back at the options, option B is 3/5. Did I make a mistake somewhere? Because 2/5 is 0.4, and 3/5 is 0.6. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me double-check the inclusion-exclusion. Numbers divisible by 2: 500. Numbers by 5: 200. Both: 100. So 500 + 200 = 700, minus 100 gives 600. So 600 numbers are divisible by 2 or 5. Therefore, 1000 - 600 = 400. So 400 is correct, so 400/1000 is 2/5. So option D.\n\nBut wait, another approach: the probability that a number is not divisible by 2 is 1/2, and not divisible by 5 is 4/5. But since these are independent events, the probability that a number is not divisible by 2 and not by 5 is (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/5) = 1/2 * 4/5 = 2/5.

Hmm.\n\nWait, let me double-check the inclusion-exclusion. Numbers divisible by 2: 500. Numbers by 5: 200. Both: 100. So 500 + 200 = 700, minus 100 gives 600. So 600 numbers are divisible by 2 or 5. Therefore, 1000 - 600 = 400. So 400 is correct, so 400/1000 is 2/5. So option D.\n\nBut wait, another approach: the probability that a number is not divisible by 2 is 1/2, and not divisible by 5 is 4/5. But since these are independent events, the probability that a number is not divisible by 2 and not by 5 is (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/5) = 1/2 * 4/5 = 2/5. Which is the same as before.\n\nSo yeah, the correct answer is 2/5, which is option D.\n\n\nTo determine the probability that a number chosen from the set \\( S = \\{1, 2, \\dots, 1000\\} \\) is relatively prime to 1000, we need to count how many numbers in \\( S \\) are coprime with 1000. Two numbers are relatively prime if they share no common positive factors other than 1. \n\nFirst, factorize 1000:  \n\\[\n1000 = 2^3 \\times 5^3\n\\]  \nThus, any number not divisible by 2 or 5 will be relatively prime to 1000. To find the count of such numbers, we use the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\n1. **Numbers divisible by 2**: There are \\( \\frac{1000}{2} = 500 \\) such numbers.  \n2. **Numbers divisible by 5**: There are \\( \\frac{1000}{5} = 200 \\) such numbers.  \n3. **Numbers divisible by both 2 and 5 (i.e., divisible by 10)**: There are \\( \\frac{1000}{10} = 100 \\) such numbers.  \n\nUsing inclusion-exclusion, the total number of numbers divisible by 2 or 5 is:  \n\\[\n500 + 200 - 100 = 600\n\\]  \nThus, the number of numbers not divisible by 2 or 5 (and hence relatively prime to 1000) is:  \n\\[\n1000 - 600 = 400\n\\]  \n\nThe probability is then the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes:  \n\\[\n\\frac{400}{1000} = \\frac{2}{5}\n\\]  \n\nThis result can also be confirmed using Euler's Totient Function, \\( \\phi(n) \\), which counts the numbers less than \\( n \\) that are coprime to \\( n \\). For \\( n = 1000 \\):  \n\\[\n\\phi(1000) = 1000 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{5}\\right) = 1000 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{5} = 400\n\\]  \nThus, the probability remains \\( \\frac{400}{1000} = \\frac{2}{5} \\).\n\nThe correct answer is **D) \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\)**.\n\nAnswer: D",
