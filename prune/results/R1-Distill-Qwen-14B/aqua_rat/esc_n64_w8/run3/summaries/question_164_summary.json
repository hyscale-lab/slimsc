      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about making identical bouquets with white and red tulips. Let's see what the question says. Oh right, we have 28 white and 98 red tulips. And we can't leave any flowers out. The goal is to find the greatest number of identical bouquets possible. Hmm.\n\nWait, so each bouquet has to have the same number of white and red tulips. Because if two bouquets are identical, they must have the same count for each color. So, the number of bouquets must be a divisor of both the number of white and red tulips. Oh right, because if I'm making, say, 4 bouquets, each would have 7 white (since 28 divided by 4 is 7) and 24.5 red? Wait, no, that can't be right. Oh wait, wait, 98 divided by 4 is 24.5. Oh that's a fraction, which isn't possible because you can't have half a tulip. So 4 bouquets wouldn't work because red tulips would be fractional. So that's why we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 28 and 98. Because the GCD will give the largest number that can divide both numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\nLet me think about the numbers. 28 and 98. Let's factor them. 28 factors are 1,2,4,7,14,28. And 98's factors are 1,2,7,14,49,98. So the common factors are 1,2,7,14. The greatest is 14. So that would mean 14 bouquets. Each bouquet would have 28/14=2 white tulips and 98/14=7 red ones. That makes sense, because 2 times 14 is 28, and 7 times 14 is 98. No leftovers, as required.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. What if I choose a higher number? Like 21. Oh, 28 divided by 21 is about 1.333, which is not a whole number. So that's impossible. Same with 10, 28 divided by 10 is 2.8, which is also not an integer. So the highest possible is indeed 14.

Since all bouquets must be identical, the number of white and red in each must be the same. So, I'm looking for a way to divide both the white and red tulips into equal parts, right?\n\nWait, maybe this is a problem about finding common divisors. Because to make identical bouquets without leftovers, the number of each type of tulip must be perfectly divisible by the number of bouquets.\n\nSo, the number of bouquets, let's call it 'n', has to be a divisor of both 28 and 98. Because each bouquet will take '28/n' white tulips and '98/n' red ones. But 'n' can't be more than the smaller number of the two, but wait, no, that's not necessarily true because it's the greatest common divisor (GCD) that matters.\n\nWait, right, I should find the greatest common divisor of 28 and 98. Because the maximum number of identical bouquets would be the GCD of the two quantities. Because the GCD is the largest number that divides both numbers exactly.\n\nLet me calculate the GCD of 28 and 98. Let's see: factors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28. Factors of 98 are 1, 2, 7, 14, 49, 98. The common factors are 1, 2, 7, 14. The greatest is 14. Oh wait, but wait a second.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"no flowers are to be left out.\" So, 'n' must divide both 28 and 98 exactly. So the GCD is the right approach.\n\nSo 28 and 98: the GCD is 14. So that's the maximum number of bouquets. So the answer should be D)14.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Let me think if there's any other constraint. For example, each bouquet has to have both red and white? Oh, but the problem doesn't say that. So even if a bouquet had all red or all white, it would still be considered, but that's probably not the case here because the total counts are 28 white and 98 red. But in this case, since each bouquet must have the same number of each, the GCD approach holds.\n\nSo, yeah, the greatest number is 14 bouquets, each with 2 white and 7 red tulips.

I need to figure out how to divide these into bouquets where each bouquet has the same number of white and red tulips. And importantly, I can't have any leftover flowers. That means whatever number I come up with, both the white and red tulips must be perfectly divisible by that number.\n\nWait, so I think this is a problem about finding the greatest common divisor (GCD). Because the GCD of the two numbers will tell me the largest number of bouquets I can make such that each bouquet has an integer number of each type of tulip.\n\nLet me think. The two quantities are 28 and 98. So I need to find the GCD of these two numbers.\n\nHmm, what's the GCD of 28 and 98? Let me list the factors of each.\n\n28: The factors are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28.\n\n98: Let's see, 1, 2, 7, 14, 49, 98.\n\nLooking at both, the common factors are 1, 2, 7, 14. The greatest among these is 14.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. If the GCD is 14, does that mean I can make 14 bouquets? Let me check.\n\nEach bouquet would then have 28/14 = 2 white tulips and 98/14 = 7 red tulips. That adds up to 2 white and 7 red per bouquet. That seems correct because 14 bouquets times 2 white each is 28, and 14 times 7 is 98. So yeah, that works.\n\nBut wait, the options don't have 14 as the first choice. Let me look again. The options are A)4, B)7, C)10, D)14, E)21.\n\nOh, D is 14. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but another way to think: Maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check the GCD. Let me compute it using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nSo, GCD(98, 28). \n\n98 divided by 28 is 3 with a remainder of 14. Because 28*3=84, 98-84=14.\n\nNow, compute GCD(28,14). 28 divided by 14 is 2 with remainder 0. So the GCD is 14. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the maximum number of bouquets is 14. So the answer must be D.\n\n\nTo determine the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made using 28 white and 98 red tulips without leaving any flowers out, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers. The GCD will indicate the largest number of bouquets that can be created such that each bouquet contains an integer number of white and red tulips.\n\nThe factors of 28 are:  \n1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28.\n\nThe factors of 98 are:  \n1, 2, 7, 14, 49, 98.\n\nThe common factors of 28 and 98 are: 1, 2, 7, 14. The greatest of these is 14. To verify, dividing 28 by 14 gives 2 white tulips per bouquet, and dividing 98 by 14 gives 7 red tulips per bouquet. This satisfies the condition of using all flowers without leftovers.\n\nThus, the maximum number of identical bouquets that can be made is **14**.\n\nAnswer: D",

Let's see. The factors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28. The factors of 98: 1, 2, 7, 14, 49, 98. The common factors are 1, 2, 7, 14. So the greatest common divisor is 14. Oh, so that would mean the maximum number of bouquets is 14. But wait, let me make sure.\n\nWait, no. Because each bouquet would have 28/14 = 2 white tulips, and 98/14 =7 red tulips. So each bouquet has 2 white and 7 red. That adds up correctly. So 14 bouquets each with 2 white and 7 red would use all the tulips without leftovers.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 14. So the answer should be D.\n\nBut wait, another thought: sometimes the problem might involve more than just the GCD, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Because each bouquet must have the same number of each color. So the number of bouquets must divide both 28 and 98. So yes, the maximum number is the GCD of 28 and 98.\n\nSo yeah, the GCD is 14. So the answer is D)14.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about making bouquets with white and red tulips. The question is asking for the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made without leaving any flowers. Hmm, I think I need to figure out how to divide the tulips equally into bouquets such that each bouquet has the same number of white and red tulips. And since no flowers can be left out, it has to use all 28 white and 98 red tulips.\n\nWait, so the key here is to find the maximum number of bouquets. Each bouquet will have some white and some red tulips. Let me think about how to model this. Oh right, this sounds like a problem involving factors and greatest common divisors (GCD). Because we want the maximum number of bouquets, which would be the largest number that divides both the white and red tulip counts.\n\nSo, let's break it down. The number of white tulips is 28, and red is 98. To find the maximum number of identical bouquets, I need the greatest common divisor of 28 and 98. Because each bouquet would take a certain number of white and red, such that when multiplied by the number of bouquets, we get exactly 28 white and 98 red.\n\nWait, how do I calculate the GCD of 28 and 98? Let's see. The factors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28. The factors of 98: 1, 2, 7, 14, 49, 98. The common factors are 1, 2, 7, 14. So the greatest common divisor is 14.
