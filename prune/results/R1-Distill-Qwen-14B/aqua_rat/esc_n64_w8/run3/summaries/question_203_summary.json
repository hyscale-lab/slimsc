      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where a father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan, who are 23 and 24 years old respectively. The division is such that when their shares are invested at 4% compound interest, they'll receive equal amounts when they turn 26. I need to find Mohan's share.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. So, both sons will be receiving their shares now, invest them, and when they're 26, the amounts they get from their investments should be equal. Wait, but wait, Sohan is already 24, so he'll reach 26 in two years. Mohan is 23, so he'll reach 26 in three years. So their investment periods are different.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, the father is dividing the amount now, so each son gets a certain amount, which they invest. Then, each will wait until they're 26 to withdraw the amount. So, Mohan is 23 now, so he'll have the money for 3 years. Sohan is 24 now, so he'll have it for 2 years. Because 26 minus 24 is 2, and 26 minus 23 is 3.\n\nSo the idea is that the amount each gets now, when compounded, will be equal at 26. So, the future value of Mohan's share after 3 years should equal the future value of Sohan's share after 2 years.\n\nLet me denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's as S. So, M + S = 5100. That's one equation.\n\nThe other condition is that after their respective periods, the amounts are equal. So,\n\nM*(1 + r)^3 = S*(1 + r)^2\n\nWhere r is the annual compound interest rate, which is 4% or 0.04.\n\nSo, substituting r=0.04,\n\nM*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2\n\nI can simplify this. Let's divide both sides by (1.04)^2. So,\n\nM*(1.04) = S\n\nSo, M = S / 1.04\n\nWait, that's M equals S divided by 1.04. Alternatively, S = M * 1.04.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1) M + S = 5100\n2) S = 1.04 M\n\nSubstituting equation 2 into equation 1:\n\nM + 1.04 M = 5100\n(1 + 1.04) M = 5100\n2.04 M = 5100\n\nSo, M = 5100 / 2.04\n\nWait, let's calculate that. 5100 divided by 2.04. Let's see.\n\nHmm, 2.04 times 2500 is 5100. Because 2.04 * 2500 = 2.04 * 25 * 100. 2.04 * 25 is 51, so 51 * 100 is 5100.\n\nSo, M is 2500, and S is 2600 (since S = 1.04 * 2500 = 2600).\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the math. 2.04 * 2500.\n\n2500 * 2 is 5000. 2500 * 0.04 is 100. So 5000 +100=5100. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, M is 2500, which is option B. But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up M and S.\n\nBecause the question asks for Mohan's share, which is M. So yes, 2500.\n\nWait, but let me think again. So, M is the amount for Mohan, which is invested for 3 years, and S is Sohan's, invested for 2 years. So, after 3 years, M grows to M*(1.04)^3, and after 2 years, S grows to S*(1.04)^2. These two should be equal.\n\nSo, M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2.\n\nDividing both sides by (1.04)^2:\n\nM*1.04 = S.\n\nSo, S = 1.04 M.\n\nSo, substituting into M + S = 5100, it's M + 1.04 M = 5100 \u2192 2.04 M = 5100 \u2192 M=2500.\n\nSo, yeah, that's correct. So the answer is 2500, which is option B.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out how much Mohan gets from the Rs. 5100 that the father is dividing between the two sons. The key here is that the shares are invested at compound interest, and when they reach 26, the amounts they receive will be equal.\n\nLet me start by understanding the problem step by step. The father is dividing Rs. 5100 between Mohan and Sohan. Mohan is 23, and Sohan is 24 years old now. So, in three years, both will be 26. The father wants their investments now to yield equal amounts when they turn 26. The interest rate is 4% per annum, compounded.\n\nSo, the main idea is that the amount each son gets now, when invested at 4%, should grow to the same amount after three years. That makes sense because when they turn 26, they'll receive the same amount, which I assume is the maturity value of their investments.\n\nI think the formula for compound interest is A = P*(1 + r)^t, where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the rate of interest, and t is the time in years.\n\nSo, let's denote Mohan's share as P1 and Sohan's share as P2. We know that P1 + P2 = 5100.\n\nIn three years, the amount for Mohan will be A1 = P1*(1 + 0.04)^3, and for Sohan, A2 = P2*(1 + 0.04)^3. The problem states that A1 = A2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that when they attain 26, the amount they receive will be equal. So, does that mean that the amount they receive is equal, which is A1 = A2? Because if both are invested at the same rate, their principals must be different to give the same amount. So, yes, A1 = A2.\n\nSo, setting up the equation: P1*(1.04)^3 = P2*(1.04)^3. Wait, but if I factor that, I can divide both sides by (1.04)^3, which would give P1 = P2. But that can't be right because the total is 5100, so each would get 2550, but that's not one of the options. Hmm, I must be missing something.\n\nWait, wait. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again. Oh! The shares are invested, and when they attain 26, the amount they receive is equal. So, the problem is that the two sons will have their own amounts, and those amounts (the returns) will be equal. So, yes, A1 = A2.\n\nBut according to that, P1 = P2, which would mean each gets half of 5100, which is 2550. But the options don't have 2550. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, maybe I'm not considering that the time each amount is invested is different. Let me think. Mohan is 23, so he has 3 years until 26. Sohan is 24, so he has 2 years until 26. Oh! Oh right! Because Sohan is older. So, the time periods are different for each son. That's a crucial point I missed.\n\nSo, the problem is that the shares are invested for different periods. So, Mohan's investment is for 3 years, Sohan's for 2 years. And the amounts they receive (after their respective investment periods) should be equal.\n\nSo, the equation should be:\n\nMohan's share * (1.04)^3 = Sohan's share * (1.04)^2\n\nBecause Mohan's investment grows for 3 years, Sohan's for 2.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nP1 * (1.04)^3 = P2 * (1.04)^2\n\nAnd P1 + P2 = 5100.\n\nSo, I have two equations.\n\nLet me write them:\n\nEquation 1: P1 + P2 = 5100\n\nEquation 2: P1 * (1.04)^3 = P2 * (1.04)^2\n\nI can solve these equations to find P1 and P2.\n\nFirst, let me compute the values of (1.04)^3 and (1.04)^2.\n\n(1.04)^2 = 1.0816\n\n(1.04)^3 = 1.124864\n\nSo, equation 2 becomes:\n\nP1 * 1.124864 = P2 * 1.0816\n\nI can rearrange this to express P2 in terms of P1.\n\nP2 = (P1 * 1.124864) / 1.0816\n\nLet me compute that division: 1.124864 / 1.0816.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n1.124864 / 1.0816 = ?\n\nLet me compute 1.124864 \u00f7 1.0816.\n\nWell, 1.0816 \u00d7 1.04 = 1.124864, because 1.04^3 is 1.124864, and 1.04^2 is 1.0816. So, 1.04^3 / 1.04^2 = 1.04. So, 1.124864 / 1.0816 = 1.04.\n\nSo, P2 = P1 * 1.04.\n\nSo, P2 = 1.04 * P1.\n\nNow, substituting into equation 1:\n\nP1 + 1.04 P1 = 5100\n\nWhich is P1 (1 + 1.04) = 5100\n\nWait, 1 + 1.04 is 2.04? No, wait, 1 + 1.04 = 2.04? No, wait, 1 + 1.04 is 2.04? No, wait, 1 is 1.0, adding 1.04, so 1 + 1.04 is 2.04? No, wait that's not right. Wait, 1 + 1.04 is 2.04? Oh, no! Wait, that can't be right because 1 + 1 is 2, but 1 + 1.04 is 2.04? No, wait, 1.04 is 104, so 1 + 1.04 is 2.04. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, P1 * 2.04 = 5100\n\nSo, P1 = 5100 / 2.04\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n5100 \u00f7 2.04.\n\nHmm, 2.04 \u00d7 2500 = 5100 because 2.04 * 2500 = (2 *2500) + (0.04 *2500) = 5000 + 100 = 5100. So, 5100 / 2.04 = 2500.\n\nSo, P1 = 2500. So, Mohan's share is 2500, which is option B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. I set P1 as Mohan's share, which is invested for 3 years.\n\n2. P2 is Sohan's share, invested for 2 years.\n\n3. The condition is that after their respective periods, the amounts are equal.\n\nSo, P1*(1.04)^3 = P2*(1.04)^2.\n\nWhich I rearranged to P2 = P1 * (1.04)^3 / (1.04)^2 = P1 * 1.04.\n\nThen, P1 + P2 = 5100 => P1 + 1.04 P1 = 5100 => 2.04 P1 =5100 => P1=2500.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, Mohan's share is 2500, which is option B.\n",

And the amounts they receive (after their respective investment periods) should be equal.\n\nSo, the equation should be:\n\nMohan's share * (1.04)^3 = Sohan's share * (1.04)^2\n\nBecause Mohan's investment grows for 3 years, Sohan's for 2.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nP1 * (1.04)^3 = P2 * (1.04)^2\n\nAnd P1 + P2 = 5100.\n\nSo, I have two equations.\n\nLet me write them:\n\nEquation 1: P1 + P2 = 5100\n\nEquation 2: P1 * (1.04)^3 = P2 * (1.04)^2\n\nI can solve these equations to find P1 and P2.\n\nFirst, let me compute the values of (1.04)^3 and (1.04)^2.\n\n(1.04)^2 = 1.0816\n\n(1.04)^3 = 1.124864\n\nSo, equation 2 becomes:\n\nP1 * 1.124864 = P2 * 1.0816\n\nI can rearrange this to express P2 in terms of P1.\n\nP2 = (P1 * 1.124864) / 1.0816\n\nLet me compute that division: 1.124864 / 1.0816.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n1.124864 / 1.0816 = ?\n\nLet me compute 1.124864 \u00f7 1.0816.\n\nWell, 1.0816 \u00d7 1.04 = 1.124864, because 1.04^3 is 1.124864, and 1.04^2 is 1.0816. So, 1.04^3 / 1.04^2 = 1.04. So, 1.124864 / 1.0816 = 1.04.\n\nSo, P2 = P1 * 1.04.\n\nSo, P2 = 1.04 * P1.\n\nNow, substituting into equation 1:\n\nP1 + 1.04 P1 = 5100\n\nWhich is P1 (1 + 1.04) = 5100\n\nWait, 1 + 1.04 is 2.04? No, wait, 1 + 1.04 = 2.04? No, wait, 1 + 1.04 is 2.04? No, wait, 1 is 1.0, adding 1.04, so 1 + 1.04 is 2.04? No, wait that's not right. Wait, 1 + 1.04 is 2.04? Oh, no! Wait, that can't be right because 1 + 1 is 2, but 1 + 1.04 is 2.04? No, wait, 1.04 is 104, so 1 + 1.04 is 2.04. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, P1 * 2.04 = 5100\n\nSo, P1 = 5100 / 2.04\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n5100 \u00f7 2.04.\n\nHmm, 2.04 \u00d7 2500 = 5100 because 2.04 * 2500 = (2 *2500) + (0.04 *2500) = 5000 + 100 = 5100. So, 5100 / 2.04 = 2500.\n\nSo, P1 = 2500. So, Mohan's share is 2500, which is option B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. I set P1 as Mohan's share, which is invested for 3 years.\n\n2. P2 is Sohan's share, invested for 2 years.\n\n3. The condition is that after their respective periods, the amounts are equal.\n\nSo, P1*(1.04)^3 = P2*(1.04)^2.\n\nWhich I rearranged to P2 = P1 * (1.04)^3 / (1.04)^2 = P1 * 1.04.\n\nThen, P1 + P2 = 5100 => P1 + 1.04 P1 = 5100 => 2.04 P1 =5100 => P1=2500.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, Mohan's share is 2500, which is option B.\n\n\nThe father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan, such that their shares, when invested at 4% compound interest, yield equal amounts when they reach 26 years old. Mohan is currently 23 (needs 3 years to reach 26), and Sohan is 24 (needs 2 years to reach 26). \n\nLet Mohan's share be \\( P_1 \\) and Sohan's share be \\( P_2 \\). The total amount is \\( P_1 + P_2 = 5100 \\). The condition for equal amounts at 26 years is given by:\n\n\\[\nP_1 \\cdot (1.04)^3 = P_2 \\cdot (1.04)^2\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( (1.04)^2 = 1.0816 \\) and \\( (1.04)^3 = 1.124864 \\). Substituting these values:\n\n\\[\nP_1 \\cdot 1.124864 = P_2 \\cdot 1.0816\n\\]\n\nRearranging for \\( P_2 \\):\n\n\\[\nP_2 = P_1 \\cdot \\frac{1.124864}{1.0816} = P_1 \\cdot 1.04\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( P_2 = 1.04 \\cdot P_1 \\) into the total amount equation:\n\n\\[\nP_1 + 1.04 \\cdot P_1 = 5100\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP_1 \\cdot (1 + 1.04) = 5100\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP_1 \\cdot 2.04 = 5100\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP_1 = \\frac{5100}{2.04} = 2500\n\\]\n\nThus, Mohan's share is Rs. 2500. This matches option B.\n\nAnswer: B",

The condition is that if their shares are invested at a compound interest rate of 4% per annum, the amounts they receive when they turn 26 will be equal. I need to find out how much Mohan gets.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. First, I should figure out how much each son's share will be worth when they reach 26. Since both are getting their shares invested, and the interest is compound, I'll need to calculate the future value for each.\n\nMohan is 23 now, so in 3 years, he'll be 26. Sohan is 24 now, so in 2 years, he'll be 26. That means each son's investment will compound for a different number of years. Oh wait, right, because Mohan's money will grow for 3 years, and Sohan's for 2 years.\n\nLet me denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's as S. Since the total is 5100, M + S = 5100.\n\nNow, the future value for each share when they turn 26 should be equal. So, the formula for compound interest is A = P*(1 + r)^n, where A is the amount, P principal, r rate, and n time in years.\n\nFor Mohan: A_m = M*(1 + 0.04)^3\nFor Sohan: A_s = S*(1 + 0.04)^2\n\nSince these are equal, A_m = A_s.\n\nSo, M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2.\n\nI can rearrange this equation to find the ratio of M to S.\n\nDividing both sides by (1.04)^2, I get:\n\nM*(1.04) = S.\n\nWait, let me compute that. Because (1.04)^3 is (1.04)^2 * 1.04, so when I divide both sides by (1.04)^2, I get M *1.04 = S.\n\nSo S = 1.04 * M.\n\nBut I also know that M + S = 5100. Substituting S from above, that becomes M + 1.04*M = 5100.\n\nSo, M*(1 + 1.04) = 5100. Wait, no, wait. 1 + 1.04 is 2.04? No, wait, M + 1.04*M = M*(1 +1.04) = M*2.04.\n\nSo M = 5100 / 2.04.\n\nLet me calculate that. 5100 divided by 2.04.\n\nHmm, 2.04 times 2500 is 5100. Because 2.04 * 2500 = 2500 * 2 + 2500 * 0.04 = 5000 + 100 = 5100. Oh, so M is 2500.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me double-check. So M is 2500, S is 2500 *1.04, which is 2600. So total is 2500 + 2600 = 5100. That adds up.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure about the future values. For M, 2500 at 4% for 3 years.\n\n2500*(1.04)^3. Let's compute that. 1.04 cubed is approximately 1.124864.\n\n2500 * 1.124864 = 2500 * 1.124864. Let me calculate that. 2500 *1 = 2500, 2500 *0.124864= 312.16. So total is 2812.16.\n\nFor Sohan, S is 2600, invested for 2 years. 2600*(1.04)^2. 1.04 squared is 1.0816. 2600 * 1.0816. Let's compute that.\n\n2600 *1 =2600, 2600 *0.0816 = 212.16. So total is 2600 +212.16= 2812.16.\n\nYes, both future amounts are equal. So that checks out.\n\nWait, but the question asks for Mohan's share. So according to this, it's 2500. Looking at the options, option B is 2500. So the answer should be B.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where a father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan. Their ages are 23 and 24 respectively. The goal is to split the money such that when each of their shares is invested at a 4% compound interest rate, they'll have equal amounts when they turn 26. I need to find out how much Mohan gets.\n\nHmm, let me think about how compound interest works. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), right? But since the interest is compounded annually and the time is in whole years, maybe it's simpler. Oh wait, because each son is getting a certain amount now, and when they reach 26, their investments will mature.\n\nWait, let me calculate the time each son will invest their money. Mohan is 23 now, so he has 3 years until he's 26. Sohan is 24, so he has 2 years until 26. So, their investment periods are 3 years and 2 years respectively.\n\nLet me denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's share as S. We know that M + S = 5100. So that's one equation.\n\nThe condition is that after their respective investment periods, their amounts are equal. So the amount Mohan gets will be M*(1 + 0.04)^3, and Sohan's will be S*(1 + 0.04)^2. These two should be equal.\n\nSo, M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2.\n\nI can rearrange this to find the ratio of M to S. Let's see: M/S = (1.04)^2 / (1.04)^3. Wait, that's (1.04)^(-1) = 1/1.04. So M/S = 1/1.04.\n\nAlternatively, M = S*(1/1.04). Or, M = S * (25/26), because 1/1.04 is approximately 25/26. Wait, no, 1.04 is 26/25, so 1/1.04 is 25/26. Right.\n\nSo, M = (25/26) * S.\n\nBut since M + S = 5100, I can substitute M in terms of S.\n\nSo, (25/26)S + S = 5100.\n\nLet me compute that: (25/26 + 1) S = 5100.\n\n25/26 plus 26/26 is 51/26. So (51/26) S = 5100.\n\nSolving for S: S = 5100 * (26/51).\n\nWait, 5100 divided by 51 is 100. Because 51 * 100 is 5100. So 5100 * (26/51) = 100 * 26 = 2600. So Sohan's share is 2600.\n\nThen M = 5100 - S = 5100 - 2600 = 2500.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations. Because if M is 2500, and Sohan is 2600, let's see if the amounts are equal after their respective periods.\n\nMohan's investment: 2500 * (1.04)^3.\n\nSohan's: 2600 * (1.04)^2.\n\nLet me compute both.\n\nFirst, (1.04)^2 is 1.0816. So Sohan's amount is 2600 * 1.0816. Let's compute that: 2600 * 1.0816. 2600 * 1 is 2600, 2600 * 0.08 is 208, 2600 * 0.0016 is 4.16. So adding up: 2600 + 208 = 2808, plus 4.16 is 2812.16.\n\nMohan's amount: (1.04)^3. Let's calculate that. 1.04 * 1.04 is 1.0816, times 1.04 again. 1.0816 * 1.04. Let's compute that:\n\n1.0816 * 1 = 1.0816\n\n1.0816 * 0.04 = 0.043264\n\nAdding together: 1.0816 + 0.043264 = 1.124864.\n\nSo 2500 * 1.124864 = ?\n\n2500 * 1 = 2500.\n\n2500 * 0.124864 = let's compute 2500 * 0.12 = 300, 2500 * 0.004864 = approx 2500 * 0.005 is 12.5, so a bit less. Let's calculate 0.004864 *2500= 12.16.\n\nSo 300 + 12.16 = 312.16. So total amount is 2500 + 312.16 = 2812.16.\n\nYes, both are equal. So my calculations are correct.\n\nSo the shares are M=2500, S=2600. But the question asks for Mohan's share. So the answer is 2500, which is option B.\n\nWait, looking at the options, option B is 2500. So the correct answer should be B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where a father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan. Their ages are 23 and 24 respectively. The goal is to split the money such that when each of their shares is invested at a 4% compound interest rate, they'll have equal amounts when they turn 26. I need to find out how much Mohan gets.\n\nHmm, let me think about how compound interest works. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), right? But since the interest is compounded annually and the time is in whole years, maybe it's simpler. Oh wait, because each son is getting a certain amount now, and when they reach 26, their investments will mature.\n\nWait, let me calculate the time each son will invest their money. Mohan is 23 now, so he has 3 years until he's 26. Sohan is 24, so he has 2 years until 26. So, their investment periods are 3 years and 2 years respectively.\n\nLet me denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's share as S. We know that M + S = 5100. So that's one equation.\n\nThe condition is that after their respective investment periods, their amounts are equal. So the amount Mohan gets will be M*(1 + 0.04)^3, and Sohan's will be S*(1 + 0.04)^2. These two should be equal.\n\nSo, M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2.\n\nI can rearrange this to find the ratio of M to S. Let's see: M/S = (1.04)^2 / (1.04)^3. Wait, that's (1.04)^(-1) = 1/1.04. So M/S = 1/1.04.\n\nAlternatively, M = S*(1/1.04). Or, M = S * (25/26), because 1/1.04 is approximately 25/26. Wait, no, 1.04 is 26/25, so 1/1.04 is 25/26. Right.\n\nSo, M = (25/26) * S.\n\nBut since M + S = 5100, I can substitute M in terms of S.\n\nSo, (25/26)S + S = 5100.\n\nLet me compute that: (25/26 + 1) S = 5100.\n\n25/26 plus 26/26 is 51/26. So (51/26) S = 5100.\n\nSolving for S: S = 5100 * (26/51).\n\nWait, 5100 divided by 51 is 100. Because 51 * 100 is 5100. So 5100 * (26/51) = 100 * 26 = 2600. So Sohan's share is 2600.\n\nThen M = 5100 - S = 5100 - 2600 = 2500.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations. Because if M is 2500, and Sohan is 2600, let's see if the amounts are equal after their respective periods.\n\nMohan's investment: 2500 * (1.04)^3.\n\nSohan's: 2600 * (1.04)^2.\n\nLet me compute both.\n\nFirst, (1.04)^2 is 1.0816. So Sohan's amount is 2600 * 1.0816. Let's compute that: 2600 * 1.0816. 2600 * 1 is 2600, 2600 * 0.08 is 208, 2600 * 0.0016 is 4.16. So adding up: 2600 + 208 = 2808, plus 4.16 is 2812.16.\n\nMohan's amount: (1.04)^3. Let's calculate that. 1.04 * 1.04 is 1.0816, times 1.04 again. 1.0816 * 1.04. Let's compute that:\n\n1.0816 * 1 = 1.0816\n\n1.0816 * 0.04 = 0.043264\n\nAdding together: 1.0816 + 0.043264 = 1.124864.\n\nSo 2500 * 1.124864 = ?\n\n2500 * 1 = 2500.\n\n2500 * 0.124864 = let's compute 2500 * 0.12 = 300, 2500 * 0.004864 = approx 2500 * 0.005 is 12.5, so a bit less. Let's calculate 0.004864 *2500= 12.16.\n\nSo 300 + 12.16 = 312.16. So total amount is 2500 + 312.16 = 2812.16.\n\nYes, both are equal. So my calculations are correct.\n\nSo the shares are M=2500, S=2600. But the question asks for Mohan's share. So the answer is 2500, which is option B.\n\nWait, looking at the options, option B is 2500. So the correct answer should be B.\n\n\nThe father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan (23 years old) and Sohan (24 years old), such that their shares, when invested at 4% compound interest, yield equal amounts when they turn 26. Let Mohan's share be \\( M \\) and Sohan's share be \\( S \\). The total amount is \\( M + S = 5100 \\).\n\nThe condition is that the future values of their investments must be equal. For Mohan, the investment period is 3 years, and for Sohan, it is 2 years. Using the compound interest formula, the future values are:\n\n\\[\nM \\cdot (1 + 0.04)^3 = S \\cdot (1 + 0.04)^2\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\nM \\cdot (1.04)^3 = S \\cdot (1.04)^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\nM = S \\cdot \\frac{(1.04)^2}{(1.04)^3} = S \\cdot \\frac{1}{1.04}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nM = S \\cdot \\frac{25}{26}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( M = \\frac{25}{26}S \\) into \\( M + S = 5100 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{25}{26}S + S = 5100\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{25}{26} + 1\\right)S = 5100\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{51}{26}S = 5100\n\\]\n\n\\[\nS = 5100 \\cdot \\frac{26}{51} = 2600\n\\]\n\nThus, Sohan's share is Rs. 2600. Mohan's share is:\n\n\\[\nM = 5100 - S = 5100 - 2600 = 2500\n\\]\n\nTo verify, the future values of both shares are calculated:\n\n- Mohan's future value: \\( 2500 \\cdot (1.04)^3 = 2500 \\cdot 1.124864 = 2812.16 \\)\n- Sohan's future value: \\( 2600 \\cdot (1.04)^2 = 2600 \\cdot 1.0816 = 2812.16 \\)\n\nBoth future values are equal, confirming the solution is correct. Mohan's share is Rs. 2500.\n\nAnswer: B",

I need to find out how much Mohan gets.\n\nHmm, let me think about this. So the key here is that the money each son gets now, when invested, should give them the same amount when they reach 26. Right, so the time each amount is invested depends on how old they are now.\n\nMohan is 23, so he'll be 26 in 3 years. Sohan is 24, so he'll be 26 in 2 years. Because their investment periods are different, the amounts they receive now must be different to end up equal after their respective investment periods.\n\nI remember that compound interest can be calculated with the formula A = P*(1 + r)^t, where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the interest rate, and t is the time in years. Since both investments are at 4% per annum, r is 0.04 for both.\n\nLet me denote Mohan's share as x and Sohan's share as y. So, x + y should equal 5100 because that's the total amount the father is dividing.\n\nNow, when each invests their share, the amount they get at 26 should be equal. So for Mohan, his investment grows for 3 years. So his amount will be x*(1.04)^3. For Sohan, his investment grows for 2 years, so his amount is y*(1.04)^2. And these two should be equal.\n\nSo I can write the equation: x*(1.04)^3 = y*(1.04)^2.\n\nWait, maybe I can rearrange this to find a relationship between x and y. Let's see, dividing both sides by (1.04)^2, I get x*(1.04) = y. So y equals x multiplied by 1.04.\n\nNow, since x + y = 5100, substituting y gives x + 1.04x = 5100. Combining like terms, that's 2.04x = 5100. So x is 5100 divided by 2.04.\n\nLet me calculate that. 5100 divided by 2.04. Hmm, let's see, 2.04 times 2500 is 5100 because 2.04 * 2500 = 5100. Oh wait, that's perfect. So x is 2500. That means Mohan gets 2500, and Sohan gets 2500 * 1.04, which is 2600. Because 2500 + 2600 is 5100.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check the math. 2500 *1.04 is 2500 + (2500 *0.04) which is 2500 + 100 = 2600. Yes, that adds up to 5100.\n\nSo Mohan's share is 2500, which would be option B. But wait, the options are A)2400, B)2500, C)2600, D)2700, E)None. So B is an option, so that's the answer.\n",

So the key here is that the future values of their investments are equal.\n\nMohan is 23 now, so he'll be 26 in 3 years. Sohan is 24, so he'll be 26 in 2 years. The compound interest formula is A = P(1 + r)^t, where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the rate, and t is time.\n\nLet me denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's as S. The total is 5100, so M + S = 5100.\n\nNow, the future value for Mohan's investment after 3 years should equal Sohan's after 2 years. So, M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2.\n\nI can write this equation as M/S = (1.04)^2 / (1.04)^3. Wait, wait, no, because M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2 \u2192 M/S = (1.04)^2 / (1.04)^3 \u2192 which simplifies to 1/(1.04) = 1/1.04. So M/S = 1/1.04.\n\nWait, let me compute that ratio again. So M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2 \u2192 dividing both sides by (1.04)^2, I get M*(1.04) = S. So M = S / 1.04.\n\nAlternatively, M = S * (1 / 1.04) \u2192 approximately 0.9615 S.\n\nBut maybe it's better to write M = S * (1.04)^(-1). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since M/S = (1.04)^(-1), that's the same as M = S / 1.04.\n\nBut I can also express S in terms of M. Let's see, from M + S = 5100, S = 5100 - M.\n\nSubstituting into the equation M*(1.04)^3 = (5100 - M)*(1.04)^2.\n\nLet me expand that. Let me compute (1.04)^2 and (1.04)^3.\n\n(1.04)^2 = 1.0816, and (1.04)^3 = 1.124864.\n\nSo, M*1.124864 = (5100 - M)*1.0816.\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side.\n\nM*1.124864 + M*1.0816 = 5100 *1.0816.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Let me do the algebra step by step.\n\nM*1.124864 = (5100 - M)*1.0816.\n\nExpanding the right side: 5100*1.0816 - M*1.0816.\n\nBring all M terms to the left:\n\nM*1.124864 + M*1.0816 = 5100 *1.0816.\n\nFactor M:\n\nM*(1.124864 + 1.0816) = 5100 *1.0816.\n\nCompute the sum inside the parentheses: 1.124864 + 1.0816 = 2.206464.\n\nSo, M = (5100 *1.0816) / 2.206464.\n\nLet me compute 5100 *1.0816.\n\n5100 * 1.0816: Let's compute 5100 * 1 = 5100. 5100 * 0.08 = 408, 5100 * 0.0016 = 8.16. So 5100 + 408 = 5508; 5508 +8.16= 5516.16.\n\nSo numerator is 5516.16.\n\nDenominator is 2.206464.\n\nSo M = 5516.16 / 2.206464.\n\nLet me compute that division.\n\nHmm, 2.206464 \u00d7 2500 is 5516.16, right? Because 2.206464 * 2500 = 2.206464 * (2.5 * 1000) = (5.51616) * 1000 = 5516.16.\n\nOh, so M is 2500.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 2.206464 * 2500 is 5516.16, which matches the numerator.\n\nSo M is 2500, and S is 5100 -2500 = 2600.\n\nWait, but let's check if that makes sense. Let me compute the future values.\n\nMohan's share is 2500, invested for 3 years at 4%: 2500 * (1.04)^3.\n\n(1.04)^3 is approximately 1.124864. So 2500 *1.124864 = 2812.16.\n\nSohan's share is 2600, invested for 2 years: 2600*(1.04)^2. (1.04)^2 is 1.0816. 2600 *1.0816 = 2812.16.\n\nYes, they are equal.

Because the problem says the father divides the amount in such a way that when they reach 26, the amounts are equal.\n\nSo the future value of Mohan's share is M*(1.04)^3, and Sohan's is S*(1.04)^2.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where a father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan, who are currently 23 and 24 years old. The division is such that if their shares are invested at a 4% compound interest rate, they'll receive equal amounts when they turn 26. I need to find out Mohan's share.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. Both sons will get some amount now, and when they're 26, the investments will be worth the same. So the key here is that the future values of their investments are equal.\n\nMohan is 23 now, so he'll be 26 in 3 years. Sohan is 24, so he'll be 26 in 2 years. The compound interest formula is A = P(1 + r)^t, where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the rate, and t is time.\n\nLet me denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's as S. The total is 5100, so M + S = 5100.\n\nNow, the future value for Mohan's investment after 3 years should equal Sohan's after 2 years. So, M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2.\n\nI can write this equation as M/S = (1.04)^2 / (1.04)^3. Wait, wait, no, because M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2 \u2192 M/S = (1.04)^2 / (1.04)^3 \u2192 which simplifies to 1/(1.04) = 1/1.04. So M/S = 1/1.04.\n\nWait, let me compute that ratio again. So M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2 \u2192 dividing both sides by (1.04)^2, I get M*(1.04) = S. So M = S / 1.04.\n\nAlternatively, M = S * (1 / 1.04) \u2192 approximately 0.9615 S.\n\nBut maybe it's better to write M = S * (1.04)^(-1). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since M/S = (1.04)^(-1), that's the same as M = S / 1.04.\n\nBut I can also express S in terms of M. Let's see, from M + S = 5100, S = 5100 - M.\n\nSubstituting into the equation M*(1.04)^3 = (5100 - M)*(1.04)^2.\n\nLet me expand that. Let me compute (1.04)^2 and (1.04)^3.\n\n(1.04)^2 = 1.0816, and (1.04)^3 = 1.124864.\n\nSo, M*1.124864 = (5100 - M)*1.0816.\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side.\n\nM*1.124864 + M*1.0816 = 5100 *1.0816.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Let me do the algebra step by step.\n\nM*1.124864 = (5100 - M)*1.0816.\n\nExpanding the right side: 5100*1.0816 - M*1.0816.\n\nBring all M terms to the left:\n\nM*1.124864 + M*1.0816 = 5100 *1.0816.\n\nFactor M:\n\nM*(1.124864 + 1.0816) = 5100 *1.0816.\n\nCompute the sum inside the parentheses: 1.124864 + 1.0816 = 2.206464.\n\nSo, M = (5100 *1.0816) / 2.206464.\n\nLet me compute 5100 *1.0816.\n\n5100 * 1.0816: Let's compute 5100 * 1 = 5100. 5100 * 0.08 = 408, 5100 * 0.0016 = 8.16. So 5100 + 408 = 5508; 5508 +8.16= 5516.16.\n\nSo numerator is 5516.16.\n\nDenominator is 2.206464.\n\nSo M = 5516.16 / 2.206464.\n\nLet me compute that division.\n\nHmm, 2.206464 \u00d7 2500 is 5516.16, right? Because 2.206464 * 2500 = 2.206464 * (2.5 * 1000) = (5.51616) * 1000 = 5516.16.\n\nOh, so M is 2500.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 2.206464 * 2500 is 5516.16, which matches the numerator.\n\nSo M is 2500, and S is 5100 -2500 = 2600.\n\nWait, but let's check if that makes sense. Let me compute the future values.\n\nMohan's share is 2500, invested for 3 years at 4%: 2500 * (1.04)^3.\n\n(1.04)^3 is approximately 1.124864. So 2500 *1.124864 = 2812.16.\n\nSohan's share is 2600, invested for 2 years: 2600*(1.04)^2. (1.04)^2 is 1.0816. 2600 *1.0816 = 2812.16.\n\nYes, they are equal. So the calculations are correct.\n\nBut wait, the options are:\n\nA)2400\n\nB)2500\n\nC)2600\n\nD)2700\n\nE)None of these.\n\nSo the answer should be B)2500.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me think again. Because the problem says the father divides the amount in such a way that when they reach 26, the amounts are equal.\n\nSo the future value of Mohan's share is M*(1.04)^3, and Sohan's is S*(1.04)^2. They are equal.\n\nSo M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as M = S*(1.04)^(-1), since dividing both sides by (1.04)^2 gives M*(1.04) = S \u2192 M = S/(1.04).\n\nAnd since M + S =5100, substituting, we have S/(1.04) + S =5100.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nS*(1/1.04 + 1) =5100.\n\nCompute 1/1.04: approximately 0.9615.\n\nSo 0.9615 +1 =1.9615.\n\nSo S=5100 /1.9615.\n\nWait, let me compute 5100 \u00f71.9615.\n\nWait, 1.9615 \u00d7 2500 =5100? Let's see, 1.9615 \u00d72500 = 4903.75. Hmm, that's less than 5100. So perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm getting confused here.

The division is such that when their shares are invested at 4% compound interest, they'll receive equal amounts when they turn 26. I need to find Mohan's share.\n\nHmm, so the key here is that both shares, when invested, should give the same amount at age 26. That means the present amounts (Mohan's and Sohan's shares) when compounded for the respective periods will be equal.\n\nWait, let's think about the time each son will invest. Mohan is 23 now, so he'll reach 26 in 3 years. Sohan is 24 now, so he'll reach 26 in 2 years. So the time periods are different. So their investment periods are 3 and 2 years respectively.\n\nLet me denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's as S. We know that M + S = 5100.\n\nThe condition is that when each amount is compounded annually at 4%, they'll be equal at the end of their respective periods.\n\nSo, the formula for compound interest is A = P*(1 + r)^t, where A is the amount, P principal, r rate, t time.\n\nSo for Mohan: A_m = M*(1.04)^3\n\nFor Sohan: A_s = S*(1.04)^2\n\nAnd A_m should equal A_s.\n\nSo, M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2.\n\nWait, I can write that equation as M/S = (1.04)^2 / (1.04)^3 = 1/(1.04). Because when I divide both sides by S and (1.04)^2, M/S = (1.04)^(3-2) )= 1.04^1? Wait no, wait. Let me do it again.\n\nM*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2\n\nDivide both sides by (1.04)^2:\n\nM*(1.04) = S\n\nSo M = S / 1.04\n\nAlternatively, S = M * 1.04\n\nWait, maybe I should express S in terms of M or vice versa.\n\nSince M + S = 5100, and S = M * 1.04, then substituting into the first equation:\n\nM + M * 1.04 = 5100\n\nM*(1 + 1.04) = 5100\n\nWait, 1 + 1.04 is 2.04? No, wait, 1 is 1, 1.04 is 1.04. So adding 1 + 1.04 gives 2.04. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 1 is M's coefficient, and 1.04 is the factor for S. So M + 1.04*M = 5100.\n\nWait, that's M*(1 + 1.04) = 5100? Wait no, wait, M + S = 5100, and S = M * 1.04. So M + 1.04 M = 5100.\n\nSo that's M*(1 + 1.04) = 5100.\n\nWait, 1 + 1.04 is 2.04? Wait, 1.04 is 104, so 1 is 100. 100 + 104 = 204, so yes, 2.04.\n\nSo M = 5100 / 2.04.\n\nWait, let me compute that. 5100 divided by 2.04.\n\nHmm, 2.04 is equal to 204/100, so 5100 / (204/100) = 5100 * (100/204) = (5100 * 100) / 204.\n\nLet me compute 5100 / 204 first. 204 * 25 is 5100, right? Because 200*25 is 5000, and 4*25 is 100, so 5100. So 5100/204 =25.\n\nSo then, 25 * 100 = 2500.\n\nSo M is 2500.\n\nWait, but wait a second, that would make S = M * 1.04 = 2500 *1.04 = 2600. So M + S is 2500 + 2600 = 5100, which matches.\n\nWait, but let me check if the condition holds. So for Mohan: 2500 * (1.04)^3. Sohan: 2600 * (1.04)^2.\n\nLet me compute both.\n\nFirst, (1.04)^2 is 1.0816.\n\nSo Sohan's amount: 2600 * 1.0816 = Let's see, 2600 * 1.08 is 2808, and 2600 * 0.0016 is 4.16, so total 2808 + 4.16 = 2812.16.\n\nMohan's amount: (1.04)^3 is 1.124864. So 2500 * 1.124864 = 2500 * 1.124864. Let's compute that.\n\n2500 *1 = 2500, 2500*0.124864= 2500*0.12 is 300, 2500*0.004864 is approximately 12.16. So total is 2500 + 300 + 12.16= 2812.16.\n\nYes, they are equal. So that works.\n\nSo Mohan's share is 2500, which is option B.\n\nWait, but wait the options are:\n\nA)2400\n\nB)2500\n\nC)2600\n\nD)2700\n\nE)None of these\n\nSo the answer is B)2500.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where a father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan. They're 23 and 24 years old now. The division is such that if each of their shares is invested at a compound interest rate of 4% per annum, they'll receive equal amounts when they turn 26. I need to find out how much Mohan gets. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that compound interest grows based on the principal and the rate over time. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P the principal, r the rate, n the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t the time in years. Since the problem says 'at 4% p.a.' but doesn't specify the compounding frequency, I think it's safe to assume it's annual compounding, so n=1. That simplifies the formula to A = P(1 + r)^t.\n\nSo both sons are getting their shares now, and the money will be invested until they're 26. Let me calculate how many years that is. Mohan is 23 now, so he'll be 26 in 3 years. Sohan is 24 now, so he'll be 26 in 2 years. Oh wait, that's an important point. So the time each amount is invested is different.\n\nLet me denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's share as S. We know that M + S = 5100 because the total amount is 5100. So that's one equation.\n\nThe other condition is that when their shares are invested, the amounts they receive at age 26 must be equal. So, for Mohan, the amount after 3 years would be M*(1 + 0.04)^3. For Sohan, it's S*(1 + 0.04)^2. These two should be equal.\n\nSo I can set up the equation: M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2.\n\nHmm, simplifying that, I can divide both sides by (1.04)^2. That gives M*(1.04) = S.\n\nWait, so S = M * 1.04. Because (1.04)^3 divided by (1.04)^2 is 1.04^1, which is 1.04.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1. M + S = 5100\n2. S = 1.04 * M\n\nI can substitute the second equation into the first. So M + 1.04*M = 5100.\n\nAdding those together: 1*M + 1.04*M = (1 + 1.04)M = 2.04*M = 5100.\n\nSo M = 5100 / 2.04. Let me calculate that.\n\nWait, 5100 divided by 2.04. Hmm. Let me compute that. 2.04 times 2500 is 5100 because 2 *2500=5000, 0.04*2500=100, so total is 5100. Oh, that's convenient. So M is 2500. So S is 1.04 * 2500, which is 2600. Because 2500 * 1.04 is 2600. Let me check: 2500 * 0.04 is 100, so 2500 + 100 is 2600. Yes.\n\nSo Mohan gets 2500, Sohan gets 2600. Let me make sure the amounts after 3 and 2 years are equal.\n\nMohan's amount after 3 years: 2500 * (1.04)^3. Let's calculate that. 1.04^3 is approximately 1.124864. So 2500 * 1.124864 is about 2812.16.\n\nSohan's amount after 2 years: 2600 * (1.04)^2. 1.04 squared is 1.0816. So 2600 * 1.0816 = 2812.16. Oh, exactly the same. So that checks out.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 2500, which is Mohan's share. So the answer should be B.\n",
