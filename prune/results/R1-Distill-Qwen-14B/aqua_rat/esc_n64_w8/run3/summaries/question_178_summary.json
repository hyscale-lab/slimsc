      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to solve this problem. So, the question is about Sachin and Ajay's ages. Hmm, I think I need to set up some equations based on the information given.\n\nFirst, the problem says that Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back. Let me break that down. So, 10 years ago, Sachin's age was two times Ajay's age at that time. I'll assign variables to their current ages to make it easier.\n\nLet me denote Sachin's current age as S and Ajay's current age as A. So, 10 years ago, Sachin was S-10 years old, and Ajay was A-10 years old. According to the problem, S-10 equals 2 times (A-10). So the equation would be:\n\nS - 10 = 2*(A - 10)\n\nThat's the first equation.\n\nThe second part says that Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years. So, in 10 years, Sachin's age will be S + 10, and that equals 40. So:\n\nS + 10 = 40\n\nWait, that's straightforward. I can solve for S here. Subtracting 10 from both sides gives S = 30. So, Sachin is currently 30 years old.\n\nNow that I know S is 30, I can plug that into the first equation to find A. Let's substitute S=30 into S -10 = 2*(A-10):\n\n30 - 10 = 2*(A -10)\n20 = 2*(A -10)\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n10 = A -10\n\nAdding 10 to both sides:\n\nA = 20\n\nSo Ajay is 20 years old today. Let me check the options. Option D is 20. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations. Sachin's current age is 30. So 10 years ago, he was 20. Ajay 10 years ago was half of that, so 10. So Ajay's current age is 10 +10 =20. Yep, that makes sense. So the answer is D.\n",

The options are A)18, B)25, C)15, D)20, E)21.\n\nHmm, okay, so I need to find Ajay's current age. Let's break down the information given.\n\nFirst, let's think about the future. The problem says Sachin will be 40 in 10 years. So if I add 10 years to Sachin's current age, it'll be 40. That means Sachin's current age is 40 minus 10, which is 30. Oh wait, wait! Wait a second. No, wait. Because if in 10 years he'll be 40, that means he's 30 now. Right, because 30 +10=40.\n\nSo, Sachin is 30 years old today.

So that means right now, he's 40 minus 10. Let me write that: \n\nSachin's current age = 40 - 10 = 30 years old.\n\nOkay, so Sachin is 30 now.

Sachin will be 40 in 10 years: S + 10 = 40 \u2192 S = 30. So that's correct.\n\n2. 10 years ago, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay. So, 10 years ago, Sachin was S-10, Ajay was A-10. So, S-10 = 2*(A-10).\n\nSubstituting S=30 into the equation:\n\n30 -10 = 2*(A-10)\n20 = 2*(A-10)\nDivide both sides by 2: 10 = A -10\nSo, A = 20.\n\nYep, that's consistent. So Ajay is 20 today. Looking at the options, D is 20. So the answer should be D.\n\nI don't think I missed anything here. The steps seem straightforward. So I'm confident the answer is D.\n\n\nLet \\( S \\) be Sachin's current age and \\( A \\) be Ajay's current age.\n\n1. The problem states that Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years. Therefore, Sachin's current age is:\n   \\[\n   S = 40 - 10 = 30\n   \\]\n\n2. The problem also states that 10 years ago, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay. Ten years ago, Sachin's age was \\( S - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20 \\), and Ajay's age was \\( A - 10 \\). According to the problem:\n   \\[\n   S - 10 = 2(A - 10)\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( S = 30 \\) into the equation:\n   \\[\n   20 = 2(A - 10)\n   \\]\n   Dividing both sides by 2:\n   \\[\n   10 = A - 10\n   \\]\n   Adding 10 to both sides:\n   \\[\n   A = 20\n   \\]\n\nThus, Ajay is 20 years old today. The correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: D",

The question is about the ages of Sachin and Ajay. \n\nAlright, the first part says, \"Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back.\" So, I need to translate that into an equation. Let me think about variables. Let's say Sachin's current age is S and Ajay's current age is A. \n\nSo, 10 years ago, Sachin's age would have been S - 10, and Ajay's age would have been A - 10. According to the problem, at that time, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay. So the equation would be: \n\nS - 10 = 2 * (A - 10)\n\nGot that down. Now, the second part of the question says, \"Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years.\" So, in 10 years, Sachin's age will be S + 10, and that equals 40. So I can write another equation:\n\nS + 10 = 40\n\nOh, right, that's simple. So from this equation, I can find S. Let's solve that first. \n\nSubtract 10 from both sides: S = 40 - 10 = 30. So Sachin is currently 30 years old. \n\nNow that I know S is 30, I can plug that into the first equation to find A. Let's substitute S with 30 in the first equation:\n\n30 - 10 = 2*(A - 10)\n\nSimplifying the left side: 20 = 2*(A - 10)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2 to get rid of the coefficient. So 20 / 2 = (A - 10), which is 10 = A - 10.\n\nThen, add 10 to both sides: 10 + 10 = A, so A = 20. \n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So Ajay is 20 years old today. Let me check the options. Option D is 20. \n\nHmm, but let me double-check the equations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nSo, first equation: 10 years ago, Sachin was twice Ajay's age.

Yes, 20 is twice 10, so that works. \n\nThe second part: In 10 years, Sachin will be 40, which matches because he's 30 now. So everything checks out. \n\nI think the answer is D)20.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about Sachin and Ajay's ages. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it slow.\n\nThe question says: Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back. How old is Ajay today if Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. First, I'll note down the important information.\n\nFirst part: 10 years ago, Sachin's age was twice Ajay's age. So, if I let their ages 10 years ago be something, I can write an equation for that.\n\nSecond part: Sachin will be 40 in 10 years. That gives me another equation because I can find out Sachin's current age.\n\nLet me think about the second part first because it seems straightforward. If Sachin will be 40 in 10 years, that means his current age is 40 minus 10. So, 40 - 10 equals 30. Oh wait, no, that's not right. Wait, wait. Wait, if in 10 years he will be 40, then now he must be 40 minus 10, which is 30. So Sachin is 30 years old today.\n\nWait, wait, let me double-check that. If someone is X years old now, in 10 years they'll be X +10. So, X +10 =40 \u2192 X=30. Yes, that's correct. So Sachin is 30 now.\n\nNow, 10 years ago, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay. So, 10 years ago, Sachin was 30 -10 =20 years old. Because he's 30 now.\n\nSo, 10 years ago, Sachin was 20. At that time, Ajay's age was half of that, right? Because Sachin was twice as old. So 20 divided by 2 is 10. So Ajay was 10 years old 10 years ago.\n\nBut the question is asking Ajay's current age. So, if 10 years ago Ajay was 10, now he is 10 +10 =20. So Ajay is 20 years old today.\n\nLet me check the options. The options are A)18, B)25, C)15, D)20, E)21. So D is 20, which matches my calculation.\n\nWait, did I make any mistakes here? Let me go through it again.\n\nSachin's age in 10 years: 40. So current age: 30. 10 years ago, Sachin was 20. So Ajay was 10 then. Now, 10 years later, Ajay is 20. Yep, that's correct.\n\nI think that's right. So the answer should be D)20.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nSachin's age in 10 years is given as 40, so his current age is \\( 40 - 10 = 30 \\). Ten years ago, Sachin was \\( 30 - 10 = 20 \\) years old. At that time, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay, so Ajay was \\( \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\) years old.
