      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where Jerry bought a bond, and I need to figure out how much interest it's accrued by the time it matures. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nThe bond is a 1-year, $5,000 bond with an annual interest rate of 12%, compounded every six months. Hmm, okay. I remember that compound interest means that the interest is calculated and added to the principal more than once per year. In this case, it's every six months, so twice a year.\n\nSo, the formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), right? Where:\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- P is the principal amount ($5,000 in this case).\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal form, so 12% would be 0.12).\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year. Since it's every six months, n is 2.\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years (here, it's 1 year).\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the interest accrued, not the total amount. So I'll need to calculate the total amount and then subtract the principal to get the interest.\n\nLet me plug the numbers into the formula.\n\nFirst, convert the annual rate to a periodic rate. Since it's compounded every six months, each period's rate is r/n = 0.12/2 = 0.06, or 6%.\n\nThe number of periods in a year is n*t = 2*1 = 2.\n\nSo, A = 5000 * (1 + 0.06)^2.\n\nCalculating (1.06)^2. Let's see, 1.06 multiplied by 1.06 is 1.1236. Wait, no, 1.06 * 1.06: 1*1 is 1, 1*0.06 is 0.06, 0.06*1 is 0.06, and 0.06*0.06 is 0.0036. Adding them up: 1 + 0.06 + 0.06 + 0.0036 = 1.1236. Right.\n\nSo, A = 5000 * 1.1236. Let's compute that. 5000 * 1 is 5000. 5000 * 0.1236 is... 5000 * 0.1 is 500, 5000 * 0.02 is 100, 5000 * 0.0036 is 18. So adding those: 500 + 100 = 600, plus 18 is 618. So 5000 + 618 = 5618. So A is $5,618.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the interest accrued. So subtract the principal: 5618 - 5000 = 618. So the interest is $618.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is $618. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a calculation mistake. Alternatively, maybe I can compute each compounding period manually.\n\nFirst six months: 5000 at 6% interest. So 5000 * 0.06 = 300. So after six months, it's 5000 + 300 = 5300.\n\nSecond six months: 5300 at 6% interest. 5300 * 0.06 is 318. So adding that, 5300 + 318 = 5618. Yep, same result. So the interest is 618.

I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember what I learned in my finance class.\n\nAlright, the problem says Jerry bought a 1-year $5,000 bond. The bond has an annual interest rate of 12%, but it's compounded every six months. I need to find out how much interest it's accrued at maturity. The options are A to E, with some numbers.\n\nWait, compounding every six months means it's semi-annual compounding, right? So the interest is added twice a year. That makes sense because compounding more frequently usually leads to a bit more interest earned.\n\nLet me recall the formula for compound interest. I think it's A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt), where:\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- P is the principal amount, which is $5,000 here.\n- r is the annual interest rate, which is 12%, so 0.12 as a decimal.\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year. Since it's every six months, n=2.\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years, which is 1 here.\n\nSo plugging the numbers in: P is 5000, r is 0.12, n is 2, t is 1.\n\nLet me calculate the value step by step. First, r/n would be 0.12 divided by 2, which is 0.06. Then, nt is 2 times 1, which is 2. So the formula becomes A = 5000*(1 + 0.06)^2.\n\nWait, 1 plus 0.06 is 1.06. Then, 1.06 squared. Let me compute that. 1.06 * 1.06 is... let's see. 1 times 1 is 1, 1 times 0.06 is 0.06, 0.06 times 1 is another 0.06, and 0.06 times 0.06 is 0.0036. Adding those up: 1 + 0.06 + 0.06 + 0.0036 = 1.1236.\n\nSo A = 5000 * 1.1236. Let me compute that. 5000 multiplied by 1.1236. 5000 * 1 is 5000. 5000 * 0.12 is 600. 5000 * 0.0036 is 18. So adding those: 5000 + 600 is 5600, plus 18 is 5618. So the total amount after one year is $5,618.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the interest accrued, not the total amount. So the interest is the total amount minus the principal. So 5618 minus 5000 is 618. Oh, that would be $618. Looking at the options, option B is 618. So that's the answer.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check. Did I apply the formula correctly? Yes. The rate is 12% annually, compounded semi-annually. So each period, 6% is applied. For two periods (since it's a year), the amount becomes 5000 * 1.06 * 1.06, which is indeed 5618. So the interest is 618. So option B is correct.\n",

The options are A to E, so I need to pick the right one.\n\nWait, I remember that compound interest means that the interest is calculated and added to the principal more than once per year. Since it's compounded every six months, that would be twice a year. So each compounding period is six months, and the interest rate for each period would be half of the annual rate, right?\n\nThe annual rate is 12%, so each six-month period would have a rate of 6%. Because 12 divided by 2 is 6. So each half-year, the bond earns 6% interest on the current amount.\n\nThe principal is $5,000. Let's see, the first compounding period is six months. The interest for that period would be 5,000 multiplied by 6% (which is 0.06 as a decimal). So 5,000 * 0.06 = $300. So after six months, the amount would be 5,000 + 300 = $5,300.\n\nThen, the second compounding period is another six months. Now, the principal for this period is $5,300 because the interest from the first period has been added. So the interest here would be 5,300 * 0.06. Let me calculate that. 5,300 * 0.06 is 318. So adding that to the previous amount gives 5,300 + 318 = $5,618.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the total interest accrued, not the final amount. So the total interest is the final amount minus the principal. The final amount is $5,618, so subtracting the principal of $5,000 gives 5,618 - 5,000 = $618.

The interest is 5618 - 5000 = 618, which matches what I calculated before.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n\n\nTo determine the interest accrued on the bond at maturity, we use the compound interest formula:\n\n\\[\nA = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(P = 5000\\) (principal amount),\n- \\(r = 0.12\\) (annual interest rate),\n- \\(n = 2\\) (compounded every six months),\n- \\(t = 1\\) (1 year).\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\nA = 5000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.12}{2}\\right)^{2 \\cdot 1}\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\nA = 5000 \\left(1 + 0.06\\right)^2 = 5000 \\cdot 1.1236 = 5618\n\\]\n\nThe total amount at maturity is $5,618. The interest accrued is the final amount minus the principal:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Interest} = 5618 - 5000 = 618\n\\]\n\nThus, the interest accrued at maturity is **$618**, which corresponds to option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

Let's see, the question says Jerry bought a 1-year $5,000 bond with an annual interest rate of 12%, compounded every six months. We need to find out how much interest it's accrued at maturity.\n\nHmm, right, compound interest. I remember the formula for compound interest is A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt), where P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times it's compounded per year, t is time in years. But wait, since the question is about the interest accrued, I should subtract the principal from the total amount to get just the interest.\n\nSo, the principal here is $5,000. The annual rate is 12%, so r is 0.12. It's compounded every six months, which means twice a year, so n is 2. The time is 1 year, so t is 1.\n\nLet me plug these numbers into the formula. A = 5000 * (1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1). Calculating the inside first: 0.12 divided by 2 is 0.06. So 1 + 0.06 is 1.06. Then, 2*1 is 2, so we raise 1.06 to the power of 2.\n\nWait, 1.06 squared is... 1.1236, right? Because 1.06 * 1.06 is 1.1236. So then, A is 5000 * 1.1236. Let me compute that. 5000 * 1.1236 equals... 5000 * 1 is 5000, 5000 * 0.1236 is 618. So 5000 + 618 is 5618. So the total amount at maturity is $5,618.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the interest accrued, not the total amount. So the interest is the total amount minus the principal. 5618 - 5000 is 618. So the interest is $618.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is $618. So I think that's the right answer.\n\nWait, did I do everything correctly? Let me double-check. The rate is 12% annually, compounded semi-annually. So each compounding period is 6 months, and the rate per period is 6%. So for one year, two periods. 5000 becomes 5000 * 1.06 after six months, which is 5300. Then, the next six months, 5300 * 1.06 is 5618. Yep, that's correct. So the interest is $618.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about Jerry buying a bond, and I need to figure out how much interest it has accrued by maturity. Hmm, let's see. The bond is a 1-year $5,000 bond with a 12% annual interest rate, compounded every six months. Wait, so it's compounded semi-annually. Right, I remember that compound interest is calculated more frequently than once a year, so in this case, every six months.\n\nWait, the formula for compound interest is A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt), right? Where P is the principal amount, r is the annual interest rate (decimal), n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years. So I think that's correct.\n\nLet me break down the variables here. The principal P is $5,000. The annual interest rate r is 12%, which is 0.12 in decimal. Since it's compounded every six months, n is 2. Time t is 1 year because it's a 1-year bond. So plugging those into the formula.\n\nSo A = 5000 * (1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1). Let me compute that step by step. 0.12 divided by 2 is 0.06, right? So that's 6% per compounding period. And 2*1 is 2, so we have two compounding periods here.\n\nSo (1 + 0.06) squared. 1.06 squared. Hmm, what's 1.06 squared? Let me calculate. 1.06 times 1.06. 1 times 1 is 1. 1 times 0.06 is 0.06. 0.06 times 1 is another 0.06, and 0.06 times 0.06 is 0.0036. Adding those up: 1 + 0.06 + 0.06 + 0.0036 = 1.1236. Oh wait, that's not right. Wait, no, wait. Let me do it properly. 1.06 * 1.06. Let me multiply 106 by 106. 106*100 is 10600, 106*6 is 636, so 10600 + 636 = 11236. So 1.06 squared is 1.1236.\n\nSo then A = 5000 * 1.1236. Let me compute that. 5000 multiplied by 1.1236. Well, 5000 * 1 is 5000. 5000 * 0.12 is 600, and 5000 * 0.0036 is 18. So adding those: 5000 + 600 is 5600, plus 18 is 5618. So A is $5618.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the interest accrued, not the total amount. So the interest would be A minus P. So 5618 - 5000 = $618. Hmm, so looking at the options, option B is $618. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Because sometimes when you're working quickly, it's easy to slip up.\n\nSo P is $5000, r is 0.12, n is 2, t is 1. So (1 + 0.12/2) is 1.06. To the power of 2, that's 1.1236. Multiply by 5000 gives 5618. Subtract 5000, that's 618. Yep, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could compute each compounding period. First six months: 5000 * 0.06 = 300 interest. So after six months, it's 5300. Then, the next six months, the 300 is added to the principal for the next calculation. So 5300 * 0.06 = 318. So total interest is 300 + 318 = 618. Yep, same result.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B, $618.\n",

Let me compute that step by step. 0.12 divided by 2 is 0.06, right? So that's 6% per compounding period. And 2*1 is 2, so we have two compounding periods here.\n\nSo (1 + 0.06) squared. 1.06 squared. Hmm, what's 1.06 squared? Let me calculate. 1.06 times 1.06. 1 times 1 is 1. 1 times 0.06 is 0.06. 0.06 times 1 is another 0.06, and 0.06 times 0.06 is 0.0036.

Let me multiply 106 by 106. 106*100 is 10600, 106*6 is 636, so 10600 + 636 = 11236. So 1.06 squared is 1.1236.\n\nSo then A = 5000 * 1.1236. Let me compute that. 5000 multiplied by 1.1236.

The options are A) $5102, B) $618, C) $216, D) $202, E) $200.\n\nHmm, wait. I remember that compound interest means that the interest is calculated more than once per year.

So each compounding period is six months, and the interest rate for each period would be half of the annual rate, right?\n\nThe formula for compound interest is A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt), where:\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- P is the principal amount ($5,000).\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal form, so 12% is 0.12).\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year (since it's every six months, n=2).\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years (1 year in this case).\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the interest accrued, not the total amount. So I should subtract the principal from A to get the interest.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers.\n\nP = 5000\nr = 0.12\nn = 2\nt = 1\n\nSo, A = 5000 * (1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1)\nCalculating the inside first: 0.12 divided by 2 is 0.06. So 1 + 0.06 is 1.06.\n\nThen, 2*1 is 2, so 1.06 squared. Let me compute that. 1.06 * 1.06 is... let's see, 1*1 is 1, 1*0.06 is 0.06, 0.06*1 is 0.06, and 0.06*0.06 is 0.0036. Adding them up: 1 + 0.06 + 0.06 + 0.0036 = 1.1236. So 5000 * 1.1236.\n\n5000 multiplied by 1.1236. Let me calculate that. 5000 * 1 is 5000, 5000 * 0.12 is 600, 5000 * 0.0036 is 18. So adding 600 and 18 to 5000 gives 5618. So A is $5618.\n\nWait, but that's the total amount, principal plus interest. The interest accrued is A minus P, which is 5618 - 5000 = 618.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is $618. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check because sometimes I might mix up the steps. So the bond is for 1 year, with 12% annual rate, compounded semi-annually. So each six months, 6% is added.\n\nFirst compounding after six months: 5000 * 0.06 = 300. So new amount is 5300.\n\nSecond compounding after another six months: 5300 * 0.06. Let's calculate that. 5300 * 0.06 is 318. So the amount after one year is 5300 + 318 = 5618. So interest is 5618 - 5000 = 618. Yep, that matches.\n\nSo the answer should be B) $618.\n\n\nTo determine the interest accrued on Jerry's bond at maturity, we use the compound interest formula:\n\n\\[\nA = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(P = 5000\\) (principal amount),\n- \\(r = 0.12\\) (annual interest rate),\n- \\(n = 2\\) (compounded every six months),\n- \\(t = 1\\) (time in years).\n\nFirst, calculate the interest for each compounding period. The semi-annual interest rate is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{r}{n} = \\frac{0.12}{2} = 0.06\n\\]\n\nThe total number of compounding periods is:\n\n\\[\nnt = 2 \\times 1 = 2\n\\]\n\nSubstitute these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\nA = 5000 \\left(1 + 0.06\\right)^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\nA = 5000 \\left(1.06\\right)^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\nA = 5000 \\times 1.1236 = 5618\n\\]\n\nThe total amount at maturity is $5618. To find the interest accrued, subtract the principal:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Interest} = A - P = 5618 - 5000 = 618\n\\]\n\nThus, the interest accrued at maturity is **$618**, which corresponds to option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

Let me think through it step by step.\n\nThe question says Jerry bought a 1-year $5,000 bond with a 12% annual interest rate, compounded every six months. They're asking how much interest it has accrued at maturity. The options are A to E, and I need to pick the correct one.\n\nHmm, I remember that compound interest means the interest is calculated and added to the principal more than once per year. Since it's compounded every six months, that's twice a year. So the interest gets added twice, right?\n\nWait, the formula for compound interest is A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt), where:\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- P is the principal amount ($5,000 in this case).\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal form, so 12% is 0.12).\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year (so 2 here because it's every six months).\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years (1 year here).\n\nSo plugging the numbers in: P = 5000, r=0.12, n=2, t=1.\n\nCalculating the amount A would give me the total amount after 1 year, including the interest. But the question is asking for the total interest accrued, which would be A minus P, the principal.\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute r/n: 0.12 divided by 2 is 0.06. So each compounding period, the interest rate is 6%.\n\nThen, nt is 2 times 1, which is 2. So we raise (1 + 0.06) to the power of 2.\n\n1.06 squared is... Let me calculate that. 1.06 * 1.06. 1*1 is 1, 1*0.06 is 0.06, 0.06*1 is 0.06, and 0.06*0.06 is 0.0036. Adding those up: 1 + 0.06 + 0.06 + 0.0036 = 1.1236.\n\nSo A = 5000 * 1.1236 = ?\n\nLet me compute 5000 * 1.1236. Breaking it down: 5000 * 1 is 5000. 5000 * 0.12 is 600, 5000 * 0.0036 is 18. So adding those: 5000 + 600 = 5600, plus 18 is 5618. So A is $5,618.\n\nBut wait, that's the total amount after one year. The interest accrued is A minus P. So 5618 - 5000 = 618. So the interest is $618.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 618. So the answer should be B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as simple interest for each period. Each six months, the interest is 6% of the principal. So first six months: 5000 * 0.06 = 300. Then the principal becomes 5300. The next six months: 5300 * 0.06 = 318. So total interest is 300 + 318 = 618. Yep, same result.\n\nSo yeah, the correct answer is B) $618.\n",
