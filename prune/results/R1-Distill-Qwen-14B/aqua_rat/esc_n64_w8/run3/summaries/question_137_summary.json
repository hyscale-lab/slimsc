      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a coin diver who gets paid for bringing up copper and brass coins. The question is asking for the minimum number of copper coins she must have brought up if she earned $3.40 after one dive. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, let's break down the information. She gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin. After one dive, her total is $3.40. I need to find the minimum number of copper coins. So, the variables involved are the number of copper coins (let's call that C) and the number of brass coins (let's call that B).\n\nSo the equation based on the pay would be: 20C + 25B = 340 cents. Because $3.40 is 340 cents. Hmm, working in cents might be easier to avoid dealing with decimals.\n\nNow, the goal is to find the smallest possible C. So, I need to find integer values of C and B such that 20C +25B =340, and C is as small as possible.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can express B in terms of C. Let's rearrange the equation.\n\n25B = 340 -20C  \nB = (340 -20C)/25  \n\nSince B has to be an integer (because you can't have a fraction of a coin), (340 -20C) must be divisible by 25. So, 340 -20C \u2261 0 mod 25.\n\nWait, let's compute 340 mod 25 first. 25 *13=325, so 340-325=15. So 340 mod25 is 15. So, 340 \u226115 mod25.\n\nSo, 340 -20C \u22610 mod25 \u2192 15 - (20C mod25) \u22610 mod25 \u2192 20C mod25 \u226115 mod25.\n\nWait, so 20C \u226115 mod25. Hmm, let's see. 20 and 25 have a greatest common divisor of 5. So for this equation to have a solution, 5 must divide 15, which it does. So there are solutions.\n\nSo, we can divide both sides by 5: 4C \u22613 mod5. Because 20/5=4, 15/5=3, 25/5=5.\n\nSo, 4C \u22613 mod5. Now, solving for C. Let's find C such that 4C mod5 is 3.\n\nLet me think about possible C values. Let's list the possible C modulo5.\n\nC mod5: 0 \u21924*0=0 \u21920 mod5 \u2192 no.\n1 \u21924*1=4 \u21924 mod5 \u2192 no.\n2 \u21928 mod5 is 3. Oh, that works! So when C \u22612 mod5, it satisfies 4C \u22613 mod5.\n\nSo, the solutions for C are numbers congruent to 2 mod5. That is, C can be 2,7,12, etc. But since we are looking for the minimum C, the smallest possible positive integer in this sequence is 2.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. Because C has to be a non-negative integer, and we need to find the minimal C such that B is also a non-negative integer.\n\nSo, if C=2, then B would be (340 -20*2)/25 = (340-40)/25 =300/25=12. So B=12. That's a valid integer, so that works.\n\nBut wait, is 2 the minimum? Let me check lower C values. What if C is 0? Let's see: 20*0 +25B=340 \u219225B=340 \u2192 B=340/25=13.6. Oh, that's not an integer. So C=0 isn't possible because B would have to be 13.6, which isn't possible. So the next possible C is 2.\n\nBut wait, I thought maybe I should check C=1. Let's see: C=1 \u219220*1=20. 340-20=320. 320/25=12.8. Not an integer. So B=12.8 is impossible. So C=1 is not a solution.\n\nSo the next possible C is 2, which works. So the minimal number is 2. But wait, the options include C=0, which would be possible if the equation allowed it. But in this case, it doesn't. So the minimal C is 2. Looking at the options, option C is 2.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any possible lower C. Let's try C=2:\n\nYes, as above, that gives B=12. So that's a valid solution. So the minimum number of copper coins is 2.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out the minimum number of copper coins the diver brought up. Let's see. Hmm, the problem says that for each copper coin, she gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin, she gets 25 cents. After one dive, she got a total of $3.40. Wait, $3.40 is the same as 340 cents, right? Because a dollar is 100 cents, so 3 times 100 is 300, plus 40 makes 340. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo the diver collected some number of copper coins and some number of brass coins. Let's call the number of copper coins 'c' and the number of brass coins 'b'. Each copper gives 20 cents, so total from copper is 20c. Each brass gives 25 cents, so total from brass is 25b. The sum of these should be 340 cents.\n\nSo the equation would be 20c + 25b = 340. I think that's right. Now, I need to find the possible values of c and b that satisfy this equation, and then find the minimum value of c.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the minimum number of copper coins. So I need to find the smallest possible c where c is a non-negative integer, and b is also a non-negative integer.\n\nHmm, maybe I can rearrange the equation to solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's try solving for b in terms of c. So, 25b = 340 - 20c. Then b = (340 - 20c)/25. But since b has to be an integer, (340 - 20c) must be divisible by 25.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can factor the equation a bit. Let's see: 20c + 25b =340. Both 20 and 25 are multiples of 5. So I can divide the entire equation by 5 to simplify. That gives 4c +5b =68. Oh, that's better.\n\nSo now the equation is 4c +5b =68. I need to find integers c and b \u22650 that satisfy this. And find the smallest possible c.\n\nI think I can approach this by trying different c values starting from 0 and see if (68 -4c) is divisible by 5 and the result is a non-negative integer.\n\nLet me start with c=0. Then 4(0) +5b=68 \u21925b=68. 68 divided by 5 is 13.6, which is not an integer. So b can't be 13.6. So c=0 is not possible.\n\nNext, c=1: 4(1)=4. 68-4=64. 64 divided by 5 is 12.8. Not an integer. So c=1 isn't valid either.\n\nc=2: 4*2=8. 68-8=60. 60/5=12. Oh, that's an integer. So b=12. So when c=2, b=12. That's a valid solution. So the total coins would be 2+12=14, but the question is about the minimum c.\n\nWait, but maybe c can be even smaller? Well, we tried c=0 and c=1 and they didn't work. So the next possible is c=2, which works. So the minimum number of copper coins is 2. So the answer should be option C.\n\nWait, but let me check higher c's just to be thorough. Maybe there's a smaller c. Oh, wait, no, c=0 and 1 don't work, so 2 is the smallest possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find another way. Let's see: 4c = 68 -5b. So 68-5b must be a multiple of 4. Let's see what 68 mod4 is. 4*17=68, so 68 mod4 is 0. 5b mod4: 5 is 1 mod4, so 5b mod4 is equal to (1*b) mod4. So 68-5b mod4 is 0 - (b mod4) \u2192 0 -b mod4. So 4c is equal to 68-5b, which implies that (68-5b) must be divisible by 4. So 68 is 0 mod4, 5b must be 0 mod4 as well. So 5b mod4 = (5 mod4)*(b mod4) =1*(b mod4). So 5b mod4 =b mod4. So for 5b to be 0 mod4, b mod4 must be 0. So b must be a multiple of 4.\n\nSo possible values of b are 0,4,8,12,16, etc. Let's plug these into 4c +5b=68.\n\nb=0: 4c=68 \u2192 c=17. So c=17, b=0. That's a valid solution, but c is 17, which is higher than 2.\n\nb=4: 5*4=20 \u2192 4c=68-20=48 \u2192 c=12.\n\nb=8: 5*8=40 \u2192 4c=28 \u2192 c=7.\n\nb=12: 5*12=60 \u21924c=8 \u2192c=2. Which is the solution we found earlier.\n\nb=16: 5*16=80, but 68-80 is -12, which would make c negative, which isn't allowed.\n\nSo the possible c values are 17,12,7,2. The smallest c is 2. So the minimum number of copper coins is 2, which is option C.\n",

Which is the solution we found earlier.\n\nb=16: 5*16=80, but 68-80 is -12, which would make c negative, which isn't allowed.\n\nSo the possible c values are 17,12,7,2. The smallest c is 2. So the minimum number of copper coins is 2, which is option C.\n\n\nTo determine the minimum number of copper coins the diver brought, we start by defining the variables: let \\( c \\) be the number of copper coins and \\( b \\) be the number of brass coins. Each copper coin earns 20 cents, and each brass coin earns 25 cents. The total earnings are $3.40, which is equivalent to 340 cents. This gives the equation:\n\n\\[\n20c + 25b = 340\n\\]\n\nTo simplify, divide the entire equation by 5:\n\n\\[\n4c + 5b = 68\n\\]\n\nWe need to find non-negative integer solutions for \\( c \\) and \\( b \\) and determine the smallest possible value of \\( c \\). Rearrange the equation to solve for \\( b \\):\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{68 - 4c}{5}\n\\]\n\nFor \\( b \\) to be an integer, \\( 68 - 4c \\) must be divisible by 5. This implies that \\( 68 - 4c \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 \\). Since \\( 68 \\equiv 3 \\mod 5 \\) and \\( 4c \\equiv (4 \\mod 5)c \\), we can rewrite the condition as:\n\n\\[\n3 - (4c \\mod 5) \\equiv 0 \\mod 5\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to \\( 4c \\equiv 3 \\mod 5 \\). Testing values of \\( c \\) modulo 5, we find that \\( c \\equiv 2 \\mod 5 \\). Thus, \\( c \\) can be 2, 7, 12, 17, etc. We now check these values to find the smallest \\( c \\) that satisfies the equation:\n\n1. **For \\( c = 2 \\):**\n   \\[\n   4(2) + 5b = 68 \\implies 8 + 5b = 68 \\implies 5b = 60 \\implies b = 12\n   \\]\n   This is valid, as \\( b = 12 \\) is a non-negative integer.\n\n2. **For \\( c = 7 \\):**\n   \\[\n   4(7) + 5b = 68 \\implies 28 + 5b = 68 \\implies 5b = 40 \\implies b = 8\n   \\]\n   This is also valid, but \\( c = 7 \\) is larger than \\( c = 2 \\).\n\n3. **For \\( c = 12 \\):**\n   \\[\n   4(12) + 5b = 68 \\implies 48 + 5b = 68 \\implies 5b = 20 \\implies b = 4\n   \\]\n   Again, valid, but \\( c = 12 \\) is larger than \\( c = 2 \\).\n\n4. **For \\( c = 17 \\):**\n   \\[\n   4(17) + 5b = 68 \\implies 68 + 5b = 68 \\implies 5b = 0 \\implies b = 0\n   \\]\n   This is valid, but \\( c = 17 \\) is the largest value.\n\nThe smallest value of \\( c \\) that satisfies the equation is \\( c = 2 \\). Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins the diver brought is **2**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a coin diver who gets paid for bringing up coins. The question is asking for the minimum number of copper coins she brought up, given that she earned $3.40 after one dive. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll restate the problem in my own words. Copper coins give her 20 cents each, and brass coins give her 25 cents each. After one dive, she has a total of $3.40. I need to find the smallest number of copper coins she could have brought up. The options are from A to E, with E being 0, so the answer might be zero if possible, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nHmm, so let's denote the number of copper coins as 'c' and the number of brass coins as 'b'. Each copper is 20 cents, which is $0.20, and each brass is 25 cents, which is $0.25. The total money she got is $3.40, which is 340 cents. Maybe working in cents will be easier, so I can avoid dealing with decimals.\n\nSo, the equation would be: 20c + 25b = 340.\n\nI need to find integer solutions for c and b where both are non-negative integers (since you can't have negative coins). And among all possible solutions, I need the one where c is as small as possible.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. One way is to express the equation in terms of one variable and see what constraints we have.\n\nLet me rewrite the equation:\n\n20c = 340 -25b\n\nDivide both sides by 5 to simplify:\n\n4c = 68 -5b\n\nSo, 4c = 68 -5b.\n\nHmm, I can rearrange this to solve for c:\n\nc = (68 -5b)/4\n\nSince c has to be an integer, (68 -5b) must be divisible by 4. So, 68 mod 4 is 0 because 68 divided by 4 is 17. So 5b mod 4 must also be 0 for the entire numerator to be divisible by 4.\n\nWait, 5 mod 4 is 1, so 5b mod 4 is the same as (1*b) mod 4. So 5b mod4 = b mod4. So, for (68-5b) to be divisible by 4, (b mod4) must be 0 because 68 mod4 is 0. So 68-5b mod4 = (0 - (b mod4)) mod4. So this must be 0. So (0 - (b mod4)) mod4 =0 \u2192 which implies that (b mod4) must be 0. So b must be a multiple of 4.\n\nSo, possible values of b are 0,4,8, etc., but we also need to ensure that 5b \u2264 340, since 25b can't exceed the total amount.\n\nWait, wait. Let's see: 25b \u2264340 \u2192 b \u2264340/25=13.6 \u2192 so b can be up to 13. But since b must be a multiple of 4, the possible values are 0,4,8,12. Let me check 16: 25*16=400, which is more than 340, so 12 is the max possible.\n\nSo possible b's: 0,4,8,12.\n\nNow, for each possible b, I can compute c and see if it's an integer.\n\nLet's go through each:\n\n1. b=0:\nc = (68-0)/4 = 68/4=17 \u2192 c=17. So 17 copper coins. That's a possible solution.\n\n2. b=4:\nc=(68 -5*4)/4 \u2192 (68-20)=48 \u219248/4=12 \u2192 c=12. So 12 copper, 4 brass. Another possible solution.\n\n3. b=8:\nc=(68-5*8)/4 \u219268-40=28 \u219228/4=7 \u2192c=7. So 7 copper, 8 brass.\n\n4. b=12:\nc=(68-5*12)/4 \u219268-60=8 \u21928/4=2 \u2192c=2. So 2 copper, 12 brass.\n\nSo the possible c values are 17,12,7,2. The question is asking for the minimum number of copper coins. So the smallest c is 2. But wait, let me check if there are any other possible b values beyond 12. Wait, next is b=16: but 25*16=400 >340, so that's not possible. So the maximum possible b is 12.\n\nSo the possible c values are 2,7,12,17. The smallest is 2. But wait, the options given are A)4, B)3, C)2, D)1, E)0.\n\nSo the options include 2 as option C. So is 2 the minimum? But wait, maybe I missed a possible b value that's not a multiple of 4 but somehow still makes c an integer. Because I thought b must be a multiple of 4 because (b mod4) must be 0. But let me double-check that logic.\n\nWait, the initial equation after simplifying was 4c =68 -5b.\n\nWe can write this as 4c +5b =68.\n\nI need both c and b to be non-negative integers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach this using the Diophantine equation method.\n\nThe equation is 4c +5b =68.\n\nWe can find all possible non-negative integer solutions for c and b.\n\nLet me solve for b:\n\n5b =68 -4c \u2192 b = (68 -4c)/5.\n\nFor b to be integer, (68-4c) must be divisible by 5.\n\nSo, 68-4c \u22610 mod5 \u2192 68 mod5 is 3 (since 5*13=65, 68-65=3). So 3 -4c \u22610 mod5 \u2192 -4c \u2261-3 mod5 \u2192 4c \u22613 mod5.\n\nMultiply both sides by the modular inverse of 4 mod5. Since 4*4=16\u22611 mod5, the inverse is 4.\n\nSo c \u22613*4 mod5 \u2192 c\u226112 mod5 \u2192 c\u22612 mod5.\n\nSo c can be written as 5k +2, where k is a non-negative integer.\n\nNow, substituting back into the equation:\n\nc=5k +2.\n\nThen, b=(68-4*(5k+2))/5 = (68-20k -8)/5 = (60-20k)/5 = 12-4k.\n\nSince b must be non-negative, 12-4k \u22650 \u2192 4k \u226412 \u2192k \u22643.\n\nAlso, since c must be non-negative, k can be 0,1,2,3.\n\nSo possible values:\n\nk=0:\nc=2, b=12.\n\nk=1:\nc=7, b=8.\n\nk=2:\nc=12, b=4.\n\nk=3:\nc=17, b=0.\n\nSo these are the possible (c,b) pairs.\n\nSo the possible c values are 2,7,12,17.\n\nSo the minimum c is 2. So the answer would be option C)2.\n\nWait, but let me check if any of the options is lower than 2. The options are A)4, B)3, C)2, D)1, E)0. So the smallest possible c is 2, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, wait! Let me make sure that for k=3, c=17, which is allowed. And for k=0, c=2. So the minimum is 2.\n\nSo the answer should be C)2. But wait, the question is about the minimum number of copper coins. So the minimum is 2. But why is E)0 an option? Because if she brought zero copper coins, then all the money comes from brass. Let's check if that's possible.\n\nIf c=0, then 25b=340 \u2192 b=340/25=13.6. Oh, that's not an integer. So b can't be 13.6. So c can't be zero.\n\nSo the next possible is c=2. So the minimum is 2.\n",

We need to find the minimum number of copper coins she could have brought.\n\nHmm, right. So, the goal is to find the smallest number of copper coins possible. That would mean she should have as few copper coins as possible, and the rest would be brass. But of course, the total has to add up to 340 cents.\n\nLet me denote the number of copper coins as 'c' and brass coins as 'b'. So, the equation would be 20c + 25b = 340. We need to find integer solutions for c and b, with c being as small as possible.\n\nWait, but c can't be negative, and neither can b. So, how do I approach this?\n\nMaybe I can rearrange the equation to express one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for b in terms of c. So, 25b = 340 - 20c. Then, b = (340 -20c)/25.\n\nBut since b has to be an integer, (340 -20c) must be divisible by 25. Let me think about the divisibility here. 20c must leave a remainder when subtracted from 340 that's a multiple of 25.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of modulo.

So when c=2, b=12. So that's a possible solution. But wait, maybe there's a c=0 case, but no, that didn't work. So is 2 the minimum?\n\nWait, but wait another second.

Let me try to break it down.\n\nThe problem says she gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin. After one dive, she earned $3.40. The question is asking for the minimum number of copper coins she could have brought up. The options are from 0 to 4, so I guess I need to figure out possible combinations of copper and brass coins that add up to 340 cents (since $3.40 is 340 cents).\n\nHmm, okay. So let's denote the number of copper coins as 'c' and the number of brass coins as 'b'. The total earnings equation would be: 20c + 25b = 340.\n\nI need to find the possible values of c and b that satisfy this equation, and then find the smallest possible c (since the question asks for the minimum number of copper coins).\n\nWait, but it's possible that she could have brought only brass coins, right? Let me check that first. If c is zero, then 25b = 340. So 340 divided by 25 is 13.6. Oh wait, that's not an integer, so b can't be a fraction. So c can't be zero because that would leave a non-integer number of brass coins. So option E is out.\n\nNext, let's try c=1. Then the equation becomes 20*1 +25b=340 \u2192 25b=320 \u2192 b=12.8. Hmm, again, not an integer. So c=1 is not possible either. So option D is out.\n\nMoving on to c=2. Then 20*2=40, so 25b=340-40=300. 300 divided by 25 is 12. So b=12. That's an integer! So c=2 and b=12 is a possible solution. So option C is a possibility, but let me check if there are smaller c's possible, like maybe c=3 or c=4.\n\nWait, wait, I already checked c=1, which didn't work. So the next possible is c=2. Let me see if there are other solutions with higher c but maybe lower than 2. No, because c can't be less than 2 in this case. Wait, no, because c=0 and c=1 didn't work, so c=2 is the next. But wait, let me check c=3 and c=4 as well to see if there's a solution with a smaller c.\n\nWait, no, because c=2 is lower than c=3 or 4. So maybe c=2 is the minimum.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me see all possible c's. So the equation is 20c +25b =340. Let's rearrange it: 25b =340-20c. So 340-20c must be divisible by 25. So 340-20c should be a multiple of 25.\n\nAlternatively, I can write 340 mod 25. Let me compute that. 25*13=325, 340-325=15. So 340 mod25 is 15. So 20c must be congruent to 15 mod25. Because 340-20c must be divisible by 25, so 20c \u2261340 mod25. 340 mod25 is 15, so 20c \u226115 mod25.\n\nHmm, 20c \u226115 mod25. Let me solve for c. Let's find c such that 20c mod25=15.\n\nI can write this as 20c = 25k +15, where k is some integer. Let me divide both sides by 5: 4c =5k +3.\n\nSo 4c \u22613 mod5. Because 5k is 0 mod5, so 4c \u22613 mod5.\n\nNow, 4c \u22613 mod5. Let's find c modulo5. Multiply both sides by the inverse of 4 mod5. The inverse of 4 mod5 is 4, since 4*4=16\u22611 mod5. So c \u22614*3 mod5 \u2192 c \u226112 mod5 \u2192 c\u22612 mod5.\n\nSo c can be written as c=5m +2, where m is an integer \u22650.\n\nSo possible c values are 2,7,12,... but since 20c can't be more than 340, let's see what's the maximum possible c. 340/20=17, so c can be up to 17.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. So, the question is about a coin diver who gets paid for bringing up coins from the bottom of a river. She gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin. After one dive, she earned $3.40. The question is asking for the minimum number of copper coins she could have brought up. The options are A)4, B)3, C)2, D)1, E)0.\n\nHmm, so I need to find the minimum number of copper coins. That probably means we want to maximize the number of brass coins because they give more money per coin. But wait, let's think about it step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably convert the total money she earned into cents because the payments are in cents. $3.40 is equal to 340 cents. So she made 340 cents in total.\n\nLet me define variables. Let's say C is the number of copper coins and B is the number of brass coins. Then, according to the problem, each copper gives 20c and each brass gives 25c. So the total would be 20C + 25B = 340 cents.\n\nWe need to find possible integer values of C and B that satisfy this equation. Since we're looking for the minimum number of copper coins, we can try to find the combination where C is as small as possible, but B is as large as possible without making the total exceed 340.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of it as trying to find the smallest C such that (340 - 20C) is divisible by 25, because 25B must equal 340 -20C. So, let me write that down:\n\n25B = 340 - 20C\nWhich implies B = (340 - 20C)/25\n\nSince B must be an integer (you can't have a fraction of a coin), the numerator (340 -20C) must be divisible by 25.\n\nLet me think about the divisibility by 25. A number is divisible by 25 if its last two digits are 00, 25, 50, or 75. So 340 is 40 cents, which is 340 cents. So 340 mod 25 is 340 /25 is 13.6, which is 13*25=325, remainder 15. So 340 mod25 is 15.\n\nWait, so 340 -20C must be a multiple of 25. So 340 -20C \u2261 0 mod25. Let me compute 340 mod25 first.\n\nWait, 25*13=325. 340-325=15. So 340 \u226115 mod25. So 340 -20C \u2261 15 -20C mod25. This must equal 0 mod25. So 15 -20C \u22610 mod25.\n\nSo 20C \u226115 mod25.\n\nHmm. Let me solve for C. 20C \u226115 mod25.\n\nI can simplify this congruence. Let me see. 20 and 25 have a GCD of 5. So for this equation to have a solution, 5 must divide 15, which it does. So there are solutions.\n\nLet me divide both sides by 5: 4C \u22613 mod5.\n\nSo 4C \u22613 mod5. Now, I need to find C such that 4C mod5 is 3.\n\nWhat's the inverse of 4 mod5? Since 4*4=16\u22611 mod5, so the inverse is 4. So multiply both sides by 4:\n\nC \u2261 (3 *4) mod5 \u2192 C \u226112 mod5 \u2192 C \u22612 mod5.\n\nSo C must be congruent to 2 modulo5. So possible C values are 2,7,12,... etc. But since we're looking for the minimum number of copper coins, we start with the smallest possible C, which is 2. But wait, let me check if that works.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. The equation 20C +25B =340.\n\nIf C is 2, then 20*2=40. 340-40=300. 300/25=12. So B=12. So that's a valid solution. So C=2, B=12. So that's possible.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the minimum number of copper coins. So the minimum possible is 0, but let's check if that's possible. If C=0, then 25B=340 \u2192 B=13.6. Which is not an integer. So C=0 is impossible.\n\nWait, but wait, 340 divided by 25 is 13.6, which is not an integer. So C can't be zero.\n\nNext, C=1: 20*1=20. 340-20=320. 320/25=12.8. Not an integer. So B would be 12.8, which isn't allowed. So C=1 is impossible.\n\nC=2: as before, 20*2=40. 340-40=300. 300/25=12. So B=12. So that works. So C=2 is possible.\n\nBut wait, earlier when I solved the congruence, I got that C must be \u22612 mod5, so C could be 2,7,12, etc. But since we're looking for the minimal C, 2 is the smallest possible.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The options include E)0, D)1, C)2, etc. So the answer would be C)2.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check for C=2: 20*2=40. 340-40=300. 300/25=12. So B=12. That's correct.\n\nBut wait, are there any smaller C? Like C=0 or 1, but as I saw earlier, they don't work. So 2 is the minimum.\n\nWait, but the options are A)4, B)3, C)2, D)1, E)0.\n\nSo the correct answer should be C)2.\n\nWait, but I should make sure there's no other possible C that's smaller than 2 but works. But from the earlier analysis, C must be 2 mod5, so 2 is the smallest possible positive integer in that sequence.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Let me try plugging in C=2 and see if that's the solution.\n\nSo, 20*2 +25*12 = 40 +300=340. Correct.\n\nIs there any C less than 2 that works? Let's see:\n\nC=0: 25B=340 \u2192 B=13.6 \u2192 Not integer.\n\nC=1: 20 +25B=340 \u219225B=320 \u2192 B=12.8 \u2192 Not integer.\n\nSo C=2 is the smallest possible. So the minimum number of copper coins is 2, which is option C.\n",

Hmm, the problem says that a coin diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin. After one dive, she got $3.40. I need to find the minimum number of copper coins she could have brought.\n\nWait, $3.40 is the total, which is 340 cents. Right, because a dollar is 100 cents. So, the total amount in cents is 340.\n\nLet me denote the number of copper coins as 'c' and brass coins as 'b'. So, each copper gives 20c, and each brass gives 25b. So the equation would be 20c + 25b = 340.\n\nI think I need to find all possible pairs (c, b) that satisfy this equation and then find the one with the smallest 'c' possible. But since we're looking for the minimum number of copper coins, I guess 'c' should be as small as possible, but it has to be a non-negative integer, right?\n\nWait, but the question is about the minimum number of copper coins. So, maybe I can find possible values of c and b that satisfy the equation, and among those, pick the smallest c.\n\nSo, let's write the equation again: 20c +25b = 340.\n\nHmm, maybe I can simplify this equation. Both 20 and 25 are divisible by 5, so let's divide the entire equation by 5.\n\nThat gives 4c +5b = 68.\n\nOkay, so 4c +5b =68. Now, I need to find non-negative integers c and b that satisfy this.\n\nI can rearrange the equation to express one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for b in terms of c.\n\n5b = 68 -4c\nSo, b = (68 -4c)/5\n\nSince b has to be an integer, (68 -4c) must be divisible by 5. So, 68 -4c \u22610 mod5.\n\nLet me compute 68 mod5. 5*13=65, 68-65=3. So 68 mod5 is 3. So, 3 -4c mod5 \u22610.\n\nWhich means (3 -4c) mod5=0. Let's write that as -4c mod5 = -3 mod5. Alternatively, 4c mod5=3 mod5.\n\nHmm, 4c \u22613 mod5. Let me find c such that when multiplied by 4 gives remainder 3 when divided by 5.\n\nLet me think of possible c values. Let's try c=2: 4*2=8, 8 mod5 is 3. Oh, that works. So c=2 is a solution.\n\nWait, wait. So 4c mod5=3 when c=2. So that's a solution. Are there other solutions? Because 4 and 5 are coprime, so the solutions for c are of the form c=2 +5k, where k is an integer.\n\nBut since c has to be non-negative, let's find all possible c values.\n\nSo, c can be 2, 7, 12, etc., but let's check if these values make b a non-negative integer.\n\nLet's plug c=2 into the equation for b.\n\nb=(68-4*2)/5 = (68-8)/5 =60/5=12. So b=12. That's valid.\n\nWhat about the next possible c? c=2+5=7.\n\nb=(68-4*7)/5= (68-28)/5=40/5=8. So b=8. Also valid.\n\nc=12: 4*12=48. 68-48=20. 20/5=4. So b=4.\n\nc=17: 4*17=68. 68-68=0. 0/5=0. So b=0. So, if she brings 17 copper coins, she gets 17*20=340 cents, which is $3.40. So that's possible.\n\nWait, but the question is about the minimum number of copper coins. So looking for the smallest c possible.\n\nSo the possible c values are 2,7,12,17,... but wait, wait. Wait a minute. Let me see if there are smaller c values.\n\nWait, because I found c=2 is the smallest, but maybe there's another way. Let's think again.\n\nThe equation is 4c +5b=68.\n\nWe can find all possible non-negative integer solutions for c and b.\n\nAnother approach: let's consider possible c values starting from 0 and see which ones make (68-4c) divisible by 5.\n\nc=0: 68-0=68. 68/5=13.6 \u2192 not integer.\n\nc=1: 68-4=64. 64/5=12.8 \u2192 no.\n\nc=2: 68-8=60 \u2192 60/5=12 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo c=2 is the smallest possible value. But wait, wait a minute. Let me check c=0: is that possible? Then all coins are brass.\n\nWait, 25*b=340 \u2192 b=340/25=13.6. Not integer. So c can't be 0. So the next possible is c=2.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check for c=1. 4*1=4. 68-4=64. 64/5=12.8, which isn't integer. So c=1 isn't allowed.\n\nSimilarly, c=3: 4*3=12. 68-12=56. 56/5=11.2 \u2192 no.\n\nc=4: 4*4=16. 68-16=52. 52/5=10.4 \u2192 nope.\n\nc=5: 4*5=20. 68-20=48. 48/5=9.6 \u2192 nope.\n\nc=6: 24. 68-24=44. 44/5=8.8 \u2192 no.\n\nc=7: 28. 68-28=40. 40/5=8 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo the possible c values are 2,7,12,17, etc., but wait, let me check higher c's.\n\nWait, for c=7: 7*20=140. 8*25=200. 140+200=340. Correct.\n\nc=12: 12*20=240. 4*25=100. 240+100=340. Correct.\n\nc=17: 17*20=340.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says that a coin diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin. After one dive, she got $3.40. I need to find the minimum number of copper coins she could have brought.\n\nWait, $3.40 is the total, which is 340 cents. Right, because a dollar is 100 cents. So, the total amount in cents is 340.\n\nLet me denote the number of copper coins as 'c' and brass coins as 'b'. So, each copper gives 20c, and each brass gives 25b. So the equation would be 20c + 25b = 340.\n\nI think I need to find all possible pairs (c, b) that satisfy this equation and then find the one with the smallest 'c' possible. But since we're looking for the minimum number of copper coins, I guess 'c' should be as small as possible, but it has to be a non-negative integer, right?\n\nWait, but the question is about the minimum number of copper coins. So, maybe I can find possible values of c and b that satisfy the equation, and among those, pick the smallest c.\n\nSo, let's write the equation again: 20c +25b = 340.\n\nHmm, maybe I can simplify this equation. Both 20 and 25 are divisible by 5, so let's divide the entire equation by 5.\n\nThat gives 4c +5b = 68.\n\nOkay, so 4c +5b =68. Now, I need to find non-negative integers c and b that satisfy this.\n\nI can rearrange the equation to express one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for b in terms of c.\n\n5b = 68 -4c\nSo, b = (68 -4c)/5\n\nSince b has to be an integer, (68 -4c) must be divisible by 5. So, 68 -4c \u22610 mod5.\n\nLet me compute 68 mod5. 5*13=65, 68-65=3. So 68 mod5 is 3. So, 3 -4c mod5 \u22610.\n\nWhich means (3 -4c) mod5=0. Let's write that as -4c mod5 = -3 mod5. Alternatively, 4c mod5=3 mod5.\n\nHmm, 4c \u22613 mod5. Let me find c such that when multiplied by 4 gives remainder 3 when divided by 5.\n\nLet me think of possible c values. Let's try c=2: 4*2=8, 8 mod5 is 3. Oh, that works. So c=2 is a solution.\n\nWait, wait. So 4c mod5=3 when c=2. So that's a solution. Are there other solutions? Because 4 and 5 are coprime, so the solutions for c are of the form c=2 +5k, where k is an integer.\n\nBut since c has to be non-negative, let's find all possible c values.\n\nSo, c can be 2, 7, 12, etc., but let's check if these values make b a non-negative integer.\n\nLet's plug c=2 into the equation for b.\n\nb=(68-4*2)/5 = (68-8)/5 =60/5=12. So b=12. That's valid.\n\nWhat about the next possible c? c=2+5=7.\n\nb=(68-4*7)/5= (68-28)/5=40/5=8. So b=8. Also valid.\n\nc=12: 4*12=48. 68-48=20. 20/5=4. So b=4.\n\nc=17: 4*17=68. 68-68=0. 0/5=0. So b=0. So, if she brings 17 copper coins, she gets 17*20=340 cents, which is $3.40. So that's possible.\n\nWait, but the question is about the minimum number of copper coins. So looking for the smallest c possible.\n\nSo the possible c values are 2,7,12,17,... but wait, wait. Wait a minute. Let me see if there are smaller c values.\n\nWait, because I found c=2 is the smallest, but maybe there's another way. Let's think again.\n\nThe equation is 4c +5b=68.\n\nWe can find all possible non-negative integer solutions for c and b.\n\nAnother approach: let's consider possible c values starting from 0 and see which ones make (68-4c) divisible by 5.\n\nc=0: 68-0=68. 68/5=13.6 \u2192 not integer.\n\nc=1: 68-4=64. 64/5=12.8 \u2192 no.\n\nc=2: 68-8=60 \u2192 60/5=12 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo c=2 is the smallest possible value. But wait, wait a minute. Let me check c=0: is that possible? Then all coins are brass.\n\nWait, 25*b=340 \u2192 b=340/25=13.6. Not integer. So c can't be 0. So the next possible is c=2.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check for c=1. 4*1=4. 68-4=64. 64/5=12.8, which isn't integer. So c=1 isn't allowed.\n\nSimilarly, c=3: 4*3=12. 68-12=56. 56/5=11.2 \u2192 no.\n\nc=4: 4*4=16. 68-16=52. 52/5=10.4 \u2192 nope.\n\nc=5: 4*5=20. 68-20=48. 48/5=9.6 \u2192 nope.\n\nc=6: 24. 68-24=44. 44/5=8.8 \u2192 no.\n\nc=7: 28. 68-28=40. 40/5=8 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo the possible c values are 2,7,12,17, etc., but wait, let me check higher c's.\n\nWait, for c=7: 7*20=140. 8*25=200. 140+200=340. Correct.\n\nc=12: 12*20=240. 4*25=100. 240+100=340. Correct.\n\nc=17: 17*20=340. So no brass coins needed.\n\nSo the possible c values are 2,7,12,17, etc. The minimum is 2.\n\nWait, but let's think again. The problem is asking for the minimum number of copper coins. So the smallest possible c is 2, which is option C.

The question is about finding the minimum number of copper coins she brought up, given that she earned $3.40 after one dive. Let me try to break this down.\n\nHmm, the problem says she gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin. So, each copper is 0.20 dollars and each brass is 0.25 dollars. The total she made is $3.40. I need to find the minimum number of copper coins she could have brought up. \n\nLet me think about variables. Let's say the number of copper coins is 'c' and the number of brass coins is 'b'. The total amount she earned would be 0.20c + 0.25b = 3.40. Right, that's the equation I need to work with.\n\nBut since we're dealing with coins, both 'c' and 'b' have to be non-negative integers. So, I'm looking for integer solutions to this equation where c and b are \u22650.\n\nWait, the question asks for the minimum number of copper coins. So I need to find the smallest possible value of 'c' such that when I subtract the amount from copper coins from the total, the remaining amount can be divided exactly by 0.25 (since each brass is 25 cents). \n\nLet me rearrange the equation. 0.20c = 3.40 - 0.25b. So, 3.40 - 0.25b must be divisible by 0.20. Alternatively, 340 cents minus 25b cents should be divisible by 20. \n\nWait, maybe working in cents would be easier. So, 20c + 25b = 340. Let me think about that. \n\nSo, 20c +25b =340. I can factor this equation a bit. Both 20 and 25 are divisible by 5, so divide the entire equation by 5: 4c +5b = 68. \n\nAh, that's simpler. So now, the equation is 4c +5b =68. I need to find integer values of c and b that satisfy this, and then find the smallest possible c.\n\nLet me think about solving for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for c: 4c =68 -5b \u2192 c=(68-5b)/4. Since c must be an integer, (68-5b) must be divisible by 4. \n\nSo, 68 mod 4 is 0, because 4*17=68. So, 5b must also give a remainder that, when subtracted from 68, leaves a multiple of 4. Wait, maybe another way: 5b mod4 must equal 0 because 68 mod4 is 0. \n\nWait, 5 mod4 is 1. So, 5b mod4 is equal to (1*b) mod4. So, (1*b) mod4 must equal 0. That means b must be a multiple of 4. So, b=4k, where k is an integer \u22650.\n\nWait, let's check that. Let me substitute b=4k into the equation 4c +5b=68.\n\nSo, 4c +5*(4k)=68 \u21924c +20k=68 \u21924c=68-20k \u2192c= (68-20k)/4 = 17 -5k.\n\nSo c=17-5k. Since c must be \u22650, 17-5k \u22650 \u21925k \u226417 \u2192k \u22643.4. Since k is integer, maximum k is 3.\n\nSo possible values of k are 0,1,2,3. Let's list them:\n\nk=0 \u2192b=0 \u2192c=17. So 17 copper coins.\n\nk=1 \u2192b=4 \u2192c=12.\n\nk=2 \u2192b=8 \u2192c=7.\n\nk=3 \u2192b=12 \u2192c=2.\n\nk=4 \u2192b=16 \u2192c=17-20= -3 \u2192 which is invalid since c can't be negative. So k can't be 4.\n\nSo the possible values for c are 17,12,7,2.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the minimum number of copper coins. So the smallest c is 2? But wait, I thought I had k=3 gives c=2, which is the smallest in the list. But let me check if k can be higher, but I think k can't be beyond 3 because c becomes negative.\n\nWait, but wait, I might have made a mistake here. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, when k=3, b=12, c=2. So that's a valid solution. Are there any other solutions where c is less than 2? Let's see.\n\nWait, what if b isn't a multiple of 4? Because I thought that because 5b mod4 has to be 0, but maybe I made a mistake in that part.\n\nLet me go back. The equation is 4c +5b =68. So 5b mod4 must be 0, because 4c is a multiple of 4, and 68 is a multiple of 4.\n\nWait, 5b mod4 is equal to (5 mod4)*(b mod4) \u2192 1*(b mod4) \u2192 so 5b mod4 = b mod4.\n\nSo 4c +5b =68 \u21925b mod4 = (68 -4c) mod4 \u2192 which is 0 mod4, because 4c is 0 mod4 and 68 is 0 mod4. So 5b mod4 must be 0 \u2192 which implies that b mod4=0.\n\nSo b must be a multiple of 4. Therefore, the possible values of b are 0,4,8,12,16,... but when I plug into c=17-5k, c can't be negative, so the maximum b is 12 (k=3).\n\nSo the possible c's are 17,12,7,2.\n\nSo the minimum c is 2.

Therefore, \\( b \\) must be a multiple of 4, i.e., \\( b = 4k \\), where \\( k \\) is a non-negative integer.\n\nSubstituting \\( b = 4k \\) into the equation \\( 4c + 5b = 68 \\), we get:\n\n\\[\n4c + 20k = 68 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad c = 17 - 5k\n\\]\n\nFor \\( c \\) to be non-negative (\\( c \\geq 0 \\)), \\( 17 - 5k \\geq 0 \\), which gives \\( k \\leq 3.4 \\). Since \\( k \\) is an integer, the possible values of \\( k \\) are 0, 1, 2, and 3. Substituting these values into \\( c = 17 - 5k \\), we find:\n\n- \\( k = 0 \\): \\( c = 17 \\)\n- \\( k = 1 \\): \\( c = 12 \\)\n- \\( k = 2 \\): \\( c = 7 \\)\n- \\( k = 3 \\): \\( c = 2 \\)\n\nThus, the possible values of \\( c \\) are 17, 12, 7, and 2. The minimum number of copper coins is \\( c = 2 \\).\n\nFinally, checking if \\( c = 0 \\) is possible: if \\( c = 0 \\), then \\( 5b = 68 \\), which gives \\( b = 13.6 \\), a non-integer. Therefore, \\( c = 0 \\) is invalid.\n\nThe minimum number of copper coins is **2**, corresponding to option **C**.\n\nAnswer: C",
