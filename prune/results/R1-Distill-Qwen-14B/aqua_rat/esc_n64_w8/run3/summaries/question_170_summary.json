      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where a man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. The trousers cost 70 rupees each and shirts are 30 rupees each. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I think I need to set up an equation because it's a problem involving total cost. Let's say the number of trousers he buys is T, and the number of shirts is S. So each trouser is 70, so the total cost for trousers is 70*T. Each shirt is 30, so shirts cost 30*S. The total expenditure is 810, so 70T + 30S = 810.\n\nBut wait, the question is about finding the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is bought. Oh right, so I need to maximize T. That means I should buy as many trousers as possible without exceeding the total amount, and then see how many shirts that leaves me with.\n\nSo how do I maximize T? Well, I can think that the remaining money after buying T trousers should be exactly enough to buy some shirts. Or wait, maybe it's possible that after buying T trousers, the leftover can be used to buy shirts. But since we want maximum T, I should find the maximum T such that 70*T is less than or equal to 810, and then see if the remaining amount is divisible by 30. Because shirts are 30 each, so the leftover must be a multiple of 30.\n\nLet me try to compute this. Let's see, 70*T \u2264 810. So T can be as high as possible without exceeding 810. Let's compute 810 divided by 70. 70 * 11 is 770, because 70*10 is 700, plus 70 is 770. 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So 11 is possible, but wait, 770 is 70*11. Then the remaining money is 810 - 770 = 40. But 40 isn't divisible by 30. Because 30*1 is 30, leaving 10, which isn't enough for another shirt. So that would mean with T=11, S would be 1 (using 30), but then the remaining 10 can't be used. But wait, the man can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So in that case, maybe T=11 is not possible because the remaining 40 can't be spent entirely on shirts. So maybe the maximum T is less than 11.\n\nLet me try T=10. 70*10 is 700. Remaining is 810-700=110. Now, 110 divided by 30 is 3 with a remainder of 20. So again, not a multiple. So S would have to be 3, but that leaves 20 unspent. Not possible.\n\nNext, T=9. 70*9=630. Remaining is 810-630=180. 180 divided by 30 is 6 exactly. So S=6. That works. So T=9 and S=6.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought T=11 might not work. Let me check that again. Because 70*11=770, and 810-770=40. 40 isn't a multiple of 30. So S would have to be 1, because 30*1=30, which leaves 10, but that's not allowed because you can't buy a fraction. So the maximum number of trousers he can buy is 9, which allows S=6.\n\nBut wait, another approach is to model this as a linear equation and find integer solutions. So 70T + 30S = 810. Let me simplify this equation. I can divide both sides by 10 to make it easier: 7T + 3S = 81.\n\nSo 7T + 3S =81. We need integer values of T and S \u22650.\n\nWe can express S in terms of T: 3S =81 -7T \u2192 S = (81 -7T)/3.\n\nSince S must be an integer, (81 -7T) must be divisible by 3. Let's see when that happens.\n\nSo 81 mod 3 is 0. 7T mod 3: 7 mod3 is 1, so 7T mod3 is T mod3. So 81 -7T mod3 \u2192 (0 - T mod3) mod3 \u2192 (-T mod3) \u2192 which must be 0. So T mod3 must be 0. So T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo possible values for T are 0,3,6,9,12. But since 70*T \u2264810, T can't be more than 11 as before.\n\nSo T can be 0,3,6,9. Let's check each:\n\nT=9: 70*9=630. Remaining 180 \u2192 S=6. So ratio is 9:6 \u2192 simplifies to 3:2.\n\nT=6: 70*6=420. 810-420=390. 390/30=13. So S=13. Ratio 6:13.\n\nT=3: 70*3=210. 810-210=600. 600/30=20. S=20. Ratio 3:20.\n\nT=0: all shirts. Not relevant as we want max T.\n\nSo among these, the maximum T is 9, which gives S=6. So the ratio is 9:6, which can be simplified to 3:2. But the question asks for the ratio of trousers to shirts when maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the ratio is 9:6, but in the options, the possible answers are the number of trousers. Wait, the options are A)9, B)8, etc. So looking back at the options, the correct number of trousers is 9, which is option A. So the answer is A.\n\nWait, but wait the options are A to E, each giving the number of trousers. The question asks for the ratio of trousers to shirts when maximum number is purchased. Wait, the options are just the number of trousers, not the ratio. Oh wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says, \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" Oh, so it's asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts, which would be T:S. So if T is 9, S is 6, the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the options given are A to E, each being a number of trousers (like 9,8, etc). Wait, that can't be right. Because the options are just numbers, not ratios.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again. The question says, \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So perhaps the options are giving the number of trousers, and the ratio is T:S, which we found to be 9:6, so the number of trousers is 9, which is option A. So the correct answer is A)9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are giving possible ratios, but no, the options are A)9 Trousers, etc. So the options are indicating the number of trousers, not the ratio. So the question is, when the maximum number of trousers is bought, what is the ratio of trousers to shirts. So the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2. But the options don't have that. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are not ratios but the number of trousers purchased. The question asks, when maximum number of trousers is purchased, what is the ratio of trousers to shirts. So the answer is the number of trousers, which is 9, so option A. Because the options are A)9, B)8 etc. So the correct answer is A.\n\nAnother way: the options are giving the number of trouser counts. So the maximum number of trousers is 9, so the answer is A.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. \n\nThe question says a man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. Trousers are 70 each, shirts are 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers possible. The options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11. Wait, actually, looking again, the options are labeled with the number of trousers, like A)9 Trousers, so the options are giving the count of trousers. Hmm, but the question is about the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number is purchased. So I think the options are giving the number of trousers, and we have to find the ratio based on that.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. The question is asking for the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So the options are probably indicating the number of trousers, and we have to find the corresponding number of shirts to get the ratio. Oh wait, but the options are single numbers, like 9,8, etc. So perhaps the options are giving the number of trousers, and we have to pick the correct one that allows the total to be 810, then find the ratio.\n\nSo the problem is to maximize the number of trousers he can buy with 810, given that each trouser is 70 and each shirt is 30. So he wants to buy as many trousers as possible, which would mean buying the maximum number of them without exceeding the total amount. Then, whatever money is left, he can buy shirts.\n\nLet me approach this step by step. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S. The total cost equation would be:\n\n70*T + 30*S = 810\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible integer value of T such that (810 -70*T) is non-negative and divisible by 30, because the remaining amount after buying T trousers must be exactly the cost for some number of shirts S.\n\nSo first, let's find the maximum T where 70*T \u2264810.\n\nCalculating 810 /70. Let's see, 70*11 is 770, because 70*10 is 700, plus 70 is 770. 70*12 would be 840, which is more than 810. So the maximum possible T is 11, but wait, let's check because 70*11=770, which leaves 810-770=40. But 40 divided by 30 is 1.333... which isn't an integer. So S would be 40/30=1.333, which isn't possible because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So T=11 is not possible because it leaves 40, which isn't divisible by 30.\n\nSo next, try T=10. 70*10=700. 810-700=110. Now, 110 divided by 30 is 3.666..., which is still not an integer. So T=10 also doesn't work.\n\nNext, T=9. 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180 divided by 30 is 6. So S=6. That works because 6 is an integer. So with T=9, he can buy 6 shirts, and the total cost is 70*9 +30*6 = 630 + 180 =810. So that works.\n\nWait, but let me check T=8. 70*8=560. 810-560=250. 250/30 is 8.333..., which isn't an integer. So no shirts possible here.\n\nT=7: 70*7=490. 810-490=320. 320/30 is 10.666... No.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I should check T=11 again. 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40 isn't divisible by 30, but maybe he can buy 1 shirt and have 10 rupees left? No, because 30*1=30, which leaves 10, but then 10 isn't enough for another shirt. So that's not possible. So the maximum T is 9.\n\nSo the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. Wait, but the options are the number of trousers, so in this case, the number of trousers is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as 'the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.' So the ratio is 9:6, which can be simplified by dividing both by 3, giving 3:2. But the options are giving the number of trousers, so the answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if there's a higher T possible.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. \n\nThe question says a man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. Trousers are 70 each, shirts are 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers possible. The options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11. Wait, actually, looking again, the options are labeled with the number of trousers, like A)9 Trousers, so the options are giving the count of trousers. Hmm, but the question is about the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number is purchased. So I think the options are giving the number of trousers, and we have to find the ratio based on that.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. The question is asking for the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So the options are probably indicating the number of trousers, and we have to find the corresponding number of shirts to get the ratio. Oh wait, but the options are single numbers, like 9,8, etc. So perhaps the options are giving the number of trousers, and we have to pick the correct one that allows the total to be 810, then find the ratio.\n\nSo the problem is to maximize the number of trousers he can buy with 810, given that each trouser is 70 and each shirt is 30. So he wants to buy as many trousers as possible, which would mean buying the maximum number of them without exceeding the total amount. Then, whatever money is left, he can buy shirts.\n\nLet me approach this step by step. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S. The total cost equation would be:\n\n70*T + 30*S = 810\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible integer value of T such that (810 -70*T) is non-negative and divisible by 30, because the remaining amount after buying T trousers must be exactly the cost for some number of shirts S.\n\nSo first, let's find the maximum T where 70*T \u2264810.\n\nCalculating 810 /70. Let's see, 70*11 is 770, because 70*10 is 700, plus 70 is 770. 70*12 would be 840, which is more than 810. So the maximum possible T is 11, but wait, let's check because 70*11=770, which leaves 810-770=40. But 40 divided by 30 is 1.333... which isn't an integer. So S would be 40/30=1.333, which isn't possible because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So T=11 is not possible because it leaves 40, which isn't divisible by 30.\n\nSo next, try T=10. 70*10=700. 810-700=110. Now, 110 divided by 30 is 3.666..., which is still not an integer. So T=10 also doesn't work.\n\nNext, T=9. 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180 divided by 30 is 6. So S=6. That works because 6 is an integer. So with T=9, he can buy 6 shirts, and the total cost is 70*9 +30*6 = 630 + 180 =810. So that works.\n\nWait, but let me check T=8. 70*8=560. 810-560=250. 250/30 is 8.333..., which isn't an integer. So no shirts possible here.\n\nT=7: 70*7=490. 810-490=320. 320/30 is 10.666... No.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I should check T=11 again. 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40 isn't divisible by 30, but maybe he can buy 1 shirt and have 10 rupees left? No, because 30*1=30, which leaves 10, but then 10 isn't enough for another shirt. So that's not possible. So the maximum T is 9.\n\nSo the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. Wait, but the options are the number of trousers, so in this case, the number of trousers is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as 'the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.' So the ratio is 9:6, which can be simplified by dividing both by 3, giving 3:2. But the options are giving the number of trousers, so the answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if there's a higher T possible. Let me try T=12: 70*12=840, which is over 810, so no. So the next possible is T=11, which doesn't work as shown before. So the maximum T is 9.\n\nWait another thought: maybe the money left after buying T=9 is 180, which is 6 shirts. So the ratio is 9:6, which reduces to 3:2.

Let's calculate how much that is. 810 divided by 70. Let me compute that.\n\n70 times 11 is 770. 70*11=770. 810-770=40. So, if he buys 11 trousers, that's 770, leaving 40. But shirts cost 30 each. So with 40, he can buy one shirt (30), and 10 would be left. But 10 isn't enough for another shirt. So he can buy 1 shirt. So total T=11, S=1. Ratio is 11:1.

So the correct answer is E) 11 Trousers.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check if 11 is possible. Because 11*70=770. 770 + 30=800. So that's 800, which is under 810. He has 10 left, but can't buy another shirt. So S is 1. So the ratio is 11:1.\n\nIs there any option for a higher number of T? No, because 12*70=840, which is more than 810.

I need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers possible. The options are A to E, each with a certain number of trousers.\n\nHmm, right. So the goal is to maximize the number of trousers. That means I should try to buy as many trousers as possible without exceeding the total amount of 810 rupees.\n\nLet me think about this step by step. So each trouser costs 70, and each shirt 30. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S. The total cost equation would be:\n\n70*T + 30*S = 810\n\nBut since we want to maximize T, I should find the largest possible integer T such that when multiplied by 70, the remaining money can be spent on shirts, which are 30 each.\n\nWait, so first, let's see how much money is spent on trousers. If I buy T trousers, that's 70*T. The rest would be 810 -70*T. This remaining amount must be divisible by 30 because each shirt is 30. So (810 -70*T) should be a multiple of 30.\n\nAlternatively, 70*T must be less than or equal to 810, and (810 -70*T) must be non-negative and divisible by 30.\n\nSo let's find the maximum T such that 70*T \u2264 810 and (810 -70*T) is divisible by 30.\n\nAlternatively, the equation can be written as 70T +30S =810. Let me try to solve for S in terms of T.\n\nS = (810 -70T)/30\n\nWe need S to be a non-negative integer, so (810 -70T) must be divisible by 30.\n\nWait, 70T must leave a remainder that, when subtracted from 810, is a multiple of 30. Let me see. 70 can be expressed as 70=7*10. 30 is 3*10. Hmm, maybe I can factor out 10.\n\nLet me rewrite the equation as 7T +3S =81 (because 70T +30S =810 \u2192 divide both sides by 10).\n\nSo 7T +3S =81.\n\nNow, we're looking for integer values of T and S where T is as large as possible, and S is non-negative.\n\nSo we can express S in terms of T:\n\n3S = 81 -7T \u2192 S = (81 -7T)/3\n\nS must be an integer \u22650.\n\nSo 81 -7T must be divisible by 3 and non-negative.\n\nSo let's find T such that 7T \u226481 and (81-7T) is divisible by 3.\n\nWait, 7T \u226481 \u2192 T \u226481/7. 81 divided by 7 is about 11.57, so the maximum possible T is 11. But wait, let me check if 81-7*11 is divisible by 3.\n\n7*11=77. 81-77=4. 4 is not divisible by 3. So T=11 is not possible.\n\nNext, try T=10. 7*10=70. 81-70=11. 11 divided by 3 is 3.666, which is not an integer. So S would be 3.666, which is not possible.\n\nNext, T=9. 7*9=63. 81-63=18. 18/3=6. So S=6. That's an integer. So T=9, S=6 is a solution.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's a higher T possible. Let's check T=8. 7*8=56. 81-56=25. 25/3 is about 8.333, which is not an integer. So no.\n\nT=7: 7*7=49. 81-49=32. 32/3 is not an integer.\n\nT=6: 42. 81-42=39. 39/3=13. So that's a solution, but T is 6, which is less than 9. So 9 is a higher T.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I missed higher T. Let me check T=12, but 7*12=84, which is more than 81. So T can't be 12.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9. So the ratio of T to S is 9:6. Simplifying, that's 3:2.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the options don't mention ratios; they just give the number of trousers. Wait, the options are A)9, B)8, etc. So the answer is option A, which is 9.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. When T=9, the cost is 9*70=630. Remaining money is 810-630=180. 180/30=6 shirts. So yes, that works.\n\nIs there a way to get more than 9 trousers? Let's see, for T=10: 70*10=700. Remaining is 110. 110/30 is 3.666, which isn't an integer. So no shirts can be bought with that. So T=10 isn't possible because S would not be an integer.\n\nSimilarly, T=11: 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40/30=1.333, which isn't an integer. So no.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again. A man spends 810 rupees buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. I need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers possible. The options are A to E, each with a certain number of trousers.\n\nHmm, right. So the goal is to maximize the number of trousers. That means I should try to buy as many trousers as possible without exceeding the total amount of 810 rupees.\n\nLet me think about this step by step. So each trouser costs 70, and each shirt 30. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S. The total cost equation would be:\n\n70*T + 30*S = 810\n\nBut since we want to maximize T, I should find the largest possible integer T such that when multiplied by 70, the remaining money can be spent on shirts, which are 30 each.\n\nWait, so first, let's see how much money is spent on trousers. If I buy T trousers, that's 70*T. The rest would be 810 -70*T. This remaining amount must be divisible by 30 because each shirt is 30. So (810 -70*T) should be a multiple of 30.\n\nAlternatively, 70*T must be less than or equal to 810, and (810 -70*T) must be non-negative and divisible by 30.\n\nSo let's find the maximum T such that 70*T \u2264 810 and (810 -70*T) is divisible by 30.\n\nAlternatively, the equation can be written as 70T +30S =810. Let me try to solve for S in terms of T.\n\nS = (810 -70T)/30\n\nWe need S to be a non-negative integer, so (810 -70T) must be divisible by 30.\n\nWait, 70T must leave a remainder that, when subtracted from 810, is a multiple of 30. Let me see. 70 can be expressed as 70=7*10. 30 is 3*10. Hmm, maybe I can factor out 10.\n\nLet me rewrite the equation as 7T +3S =81 (because 70T +30S =810 \u2192 divide both sides by 10).\n\nSo 7T +3S =81.\n\nNow, we're looking for integer values of T and S where T is as large as possible, and S is non-negative.\n\nSo we can express S in terms of T:\n\n3S = 81 -7T \u2192 S = (81 -7T)/3\n\nS must be an integer \u22650.\n\nSo 81 -7T must be divisible by 3 and non-negative.\n\nSo let's find T such that 7T \u226481 and (81-7T) is divisible by 3.\n\nWait, 7T \u226481 \u2192 T \u226481/7. 81 divided by 7 is about 11.57, so the maximum possible T is 11. But wait, let me check if 81-7*11 is divisible by 3.\n\n7*11=77. 81-77=4. 4 is not divisible by 3. So T=11 is not possible.\n\nNext, try T=10. 7*10=70. 81-70=11. 11 divided by 3 is 3.666, which is not an integer. So S would be 3.666, which is not possible.\n\nNext, T=9. 7*9=63. 81-63=18. 18/3=6. So S=6. That's an integer. So T=9, S=6 is a solution.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's a higher T possible. Let's check T=8. 7*8=56. 81-56=25. 25/3 is about 8.333, which is not an integer. So no.\n\nT=7: 7*7=49. 81-49=32. 32/3 is not an integer.\n\nT=6: 42. 81-42=39. 39/3=13. So that's a solution, but T is 6, which is less than 9. So 9 is a higher T.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I missed higher T. Let me check T=12, but 7*12=84, which is more than 81. So T can't be 12.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9. So the ratio of T to S is 9:6. Simplifying, that's 3:2.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the options don't mention ratios; they just give the number of trousers. Wait, the options are A)9, B)8, etc. So the answer is option A, which is 9.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. When T=9, the cost is 9*70=630. Remaining money is 810-630=180. 180/30=6 shirts. So yes, that works.\n\nIs there a way to get more than 9 trousers? Let's see, for T=10: 70*10=700. Remaining is 110. 110/30 is 3.666, which isn't an integer. So no shirts can be bought with that. So T=10 isn't possible because S would not be an integer.\n\nSimilarly, T=11: 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40/30=1.333, which isn't an integer. So no.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9. So the correct answer is option A, which is 9.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of trousers (T) that can be purchased with a total budget of 810 rupees, given that each trouser costs 70 rupees and each shirt costs 30 rupees. The total cost equation is:\n\n\\[\n70T + 30S = 810\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(T\\) is the number of trousers and \\(S\\) is the number of shirts. To maximize \\(T\\), we need to find the largest integer value of \\(T\\) such that the remaining amount \\((810 - 70T)\\) is divisible by 30 (since shirts cost 30 rupees each).\n\nRewriting the equation:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{810 - 70T}{30}\n\\]\n\nFor \\(S\\) to be an integer, \\((810 - 70T)\\) must be divisible by 30. Additionally, \\(70T \\leq 810\\), so \\(T \\leq \\frac{810}{70} \\approx 11.57\\). Thus, the maximum possible integer value for \\(T\\) is 11. However, checking \\(T = 11\\):\n\n\\[\n810 - 70 \\times 11 = 810 - 770 = 40\n\\]\n\nSince 40 is not divisible by 30, \\(T = 11\\) is not valid. Next, check \\(T = 10\\):\n\n\\[\n810 - 70 \\times 10 = 810 - 700 = 110\n\\]\n\n110 is not divisible by 30, so \\(T = 10\\) is also invalid. Now, check \\(T = 9\\):\n\n\\[\n810 - 70 \\times 9 = 810 - 630 = 180\n\\]\n\n180 is divisible by 30, giving \\(S = \\frac{180}{30} = 6\\). Thus, \\(T = 9\\) and \\(S = 6\\) is a valid solution. Checking higher values of \\(T\\) (e.g., \\(T = 8, 7, 6\\)) confirms that \\(T = 9\\) is indeed the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased while ensuring \\(S\\) is an integer.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased is 9.\n\nAnswer: A",

We want to maximize T, so we need to find the largest possible integer T such that when multiplied by 70, the remaining money can be spent on shirts at 30 each.\n\nSo the equation is 70T + 30S = 810. We can rearrange this to find S in terms of T. Let me do that.\n\n30S = 810 -70T  \nS = (810 -70T)/30  \nSimplify that:  \nS = (810/30) - (70T)/30  \n810 divided by 30 is 27, and 70/30 simplifies to 7/3. So,\n\nS = 27 - (7/3)T.\n\nBut since the number of shirts can't be negative, the expression (810 -70T) must be greater than or equal to zero. So:\n\n810 -70T >= 0  \n70T <=810  \nT <=810/70  \nLet me calculate that. 70*11=770, 70*12=840 which is over 810. So 810 divided by 70 is 11.571 approximately. But since T must be an integer, the maximum T can be 11. But wait, let me check. If T is 11, then the cost for trousers is 11*70=770. That leaves 810-770=40 for shirts. 40 divided by 30 is 1.333, which isn't an integer. So we can't have a fraction of a shirt. So T=11 is not possible because S would be 1.333, which isn't allowed.\n\nSo we need to try T=11 minus 1, which is T=10. Let's see. 10*70=700. Remaining is 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666. Still not an integer. So that's not possible either.\n\nHmm, moving on. Let's try T=9. 9*70=630. Remaining is 810-630=180. 180/30=6. Oh, that's an integer. So S=6. So when T=9, S=6. \n\nWait, but maybe I can find a higher T that also results in an integer S. Let me see. Let me go back. The equation is S=(27 - (7/3)T). For S to be integer, (7/3)T must be an integer subtracted from 27. So (7/3)T must be an integer. Let me denote that as (7/3)*T = k, where k is an integer. So T must be a multiple of 3. Because 7 and 3 are coprime, T must be divisible by 3. \n\nSo possible T's are 3,6,9,12,... but since T must be <=11, the possible T's are 3,6,9.\n\nWait, but earlier I tried T=11 and T=10, which are not multiples of 3. Let me check T=9 first.\n\nWait, I thought T=9 gives S=6, which is okay. Let's check T=6. Then 6*70=420, so remaining is 810-420=390. 390/30=13. So S=13. That's okay too, but we're trying to maximize T, so 9 is better than 6.\n\nWhat about T=12? 12*70=840, which is more than 810, so that's not possible.\n\nSo the next possible multiple of 3 after 9 is 12, which is too big. So the maximum possible T is 9, giving S=6.\n\nWait, but what about T=10? Let's see if it can give an integer S. 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110/30 is 3.666..., which isn't an integer. So T=10 isn't allowed.\n\nSimilarly, T=11 gives 770, leaving 40 for shirts, which isn't a multiple of 30. So that's no good.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9. So the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6. Wait, but the question asks for the ratio when maximum number of trousers is bought. So the ratio is 9:6, which can be simplified to 3:2. But the options given are in terms of the number of trousers, not the ratio. Wait, wait, looking back at the question. The options are options A) to E), each giving the number of trousers, not the ratio. Oh wait, the question says \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased\". So the ratio is T:S, which would be 9:6, simplifying to 3:2. But the options don't show the ratio; they show the number of trousers.

The options given are A to E, each giving a number of trousers, but wait, no, looking again, the options are A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. Wait, wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Oh, no, the options are the possible numbers of trousers he could buy. So each option is the number of trousers.

So I think the steps are: find how many trousers he can buy maximally, then see how many shirts he can buy with the remaining money, then find the ratio.\n\nSo first, let's figure out how many trousers he can buy with 810. Each trouser is 70. So maximum number is the largest integer less than or equal to 810 divided by 70.\n\nLet me calculate 70 times 11: 70*11=770. 70*12=840 which is more than 810. So 11 is too much. So maximum is 11? Wait, wait, 70*11=770, which is under 810. So 11 is possible. Wait, but 70*11=770, so he's spent 770 on trousers, leaving 810-770=40. Now, shirts are 30 each. Can he buy any shirts with 40? 40 divided by 30 is 1 with 10 remaining. So he can buy 1 shirt, but that's only 30, leaving 10 which isn't enough for another shirt. So the number of shirts is 1.\n\nSo the ratio of trousers to shirts is 11:1. Wait, but looking at the options, the options are A)9, B)8, etc. Wait, the options are the number of trousers, not the ratio. So the question is, what is the ratio, but the options give the number of trousers.

So the ratio is between the number of trousers and shirts. So if he buys 11 trousers, how many shirts can he buy? Let me recheck the math.\n\nTotal money: 810.\n\nIf he buys 11 trousers: 11 *70=770. So 810-770=40 left. Each shirt is 30, so 40/30 is 1.333. So he can buy 1 shirt, as he can't buy a fraction. So number of shirts is 1. So the ratio is 11:1. But wait, the options are A to E, each being a number of trousers. So I'm a bit confused. Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Oh wait, no, the options are for the ratio, but the way it's written, the options are the number of trousers, but the question is about the ratio. Hmm, maybe I misread the options.\n\nWait, looking at the options again: They are labeled A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. So each option is giving the number of trouser, but the question is asking for the ratio. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because the ratio is a comparison, like 11:1, but the options are numbers. So perhaps the question is, when he buys the maximum number of trousers, what is the number of shirts he buys? No, because the options are giving possible numbers of trousers, and the question is about the ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are giving the ratio. For example, option A is 9: something. But the way it's written, the options are just numbers followed by \"Trousers\". So perhaps the ratio is expressed as the number of trousers to shirts, and the options are possible numbers of trousers, but not the shirts. Wait, no, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The question is: What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\n\nSo the maximum number of trousers is 11, as that's the largest number he can buy without exceeding 810. Then, with 770 spent on 11 trousers, he has 40 left. He can buy 1 shirt (30), so the ratio is 11:1.\n\nBut the options are A)9, B)8, etc. So none of the options is 11:1. Wait, looking at the options again, perhaps I misread them. Let me check:\n\nOptions are:\n\nA)9 Trousers\n\nB)8 Trousers\n\nC)10 Trousers\n\nD)7 Trousers\n\nE)11 Trousers\n\nWait, no, each option is the number of trousers, but the question is about the ratio. Hmm. So perhaps the ratio is the number of trousers to shirts, and the options are giving possible numbers of trousers, but I'm supposed to find the ratio as a pair, but the options are only giving the number of trousers part of the ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, and the options are possible ratios. Or perhaps the question is asking for the number of trousers when the ratio is something. I'm getting a bit stuck.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the question is asking, when he buys as many trousers as possible, what is the number of shirts bought, and the ratio is that. But the options are about the number of trousers. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is to be expressed as a pair, like 11:1, but the options don't present that. So perhaps the problem is to find the number of shirts, given the maximum number of trousers, but the options are numbers of trousers. I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, maybe the options are giving the ratio, like option A is 9: something. But the way it's written, the options are just numbers with \"Trousers\", which doesn't make sense. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is to be calculated as the number of trousers to shirts, and the options are the possible numbers of trousers, so perhaps the correct answer is E)11, which is the maximum number of trousers, and the ratio is 11:1.\n\nWait, but the question is about the ratio, not the number of trousers. So perhaps the options are giving possible ratios, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Let me read the question again.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased as: What will be the ratio of trouser to shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased? So the ratio is (number of trousers) : (number of shirts). So the options are the number of trousers, but that would not give the ratio. Hmm, perhaps the options are for the number of shirts. No, the options are the number of trousers.\n\nI think I'm getting stuck because I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me try to approach it step by step.\n\nStep 1: Find the maximum number of trousers he can buy with 810. Each trouser costs 70.\n\nSo maximum number of trousers = 810 // 70.\n\nLet me compute that: 70 * 11 = 770, which is less than 810. 70*12=840, which is over. So maximum is 11. So he buys 11 trousers.\n\nStep 2: With the remaining money, buy shirts. Remaining money is 810 - 11*70 = 810-770=40.\n\nEach shirt is 30. So number of shirts = 40 //30 =1. So he can buy 1 shirt.\n\nSo the ratio of trousers to shirts is 11:1. So the ratio is 11:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, the options are:\n\nA)9 Trousers\n\nB)8 Trousers\n\nC)10 Trousers\n\nD)7 Trousers\n\nE)11 Trousers\n\nWait, these options are the number of trousers, not the ratio. So perhaps the question is asking for the number of shirts bought when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So in that case, the number of shirts is 1. But that's not one of the options. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the remaining money. Let me double-check.\n\n11 trousers cost 770. 810-770=40. Shirts are 30 each. 40 divided by 30 is 1.333, so 1 shirt. So that's correct.\n\nBut if the question is about the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts, which is 11:1. But the options are numbers of trousers, so perhaps the ratio is 11:1, but the options don't present that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the number of shirts, but that's 1, which isn't an option. So perhaps I've made a mistake.\n\nWait another approach: Maybe the maximum number of trousers is not 11. Let's see: 810 divided by 70. Let's compute it exactly.\n\n70 times 11 is 770. 70 *11.571 would be 810. But he can't buy a fraction. So maximum is 11.\n\nSo perhaps the ratio is 11:1, but the options are E)11 Trousers. So perhaps the question is asking for the maximum number of trousers, which is 11, and the ratio is 11:1, but the options are giving the number of trousers, so the correct option is E.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is phrased as, when purchasing the maximum number of trousers, what is the ratio, and the options are the number of trousers, so the correct answer is E)11. So the ratio is 11:1, but the options don't present the ratio. Hmm, perhaps the question is not about the ratio but about the number of shirts. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is: What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased? So the ratio is 11:1. But none of the options match this. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of shirts, which is 1, but that's not an option either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me try another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the man can buy more shirts by buying fewer trousers. But the question states that we need to find the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So that's 11, with 1 shirt.\n\nWait, but perhaps the question is asking for the ratio in terms of the number of items bought, not the ratio of their counts. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio is expressed as the number of shirts to trousers, but that's 1:11, which isn't any of the options.\n\nWait, maybe the options are giving the possible ratios, but written as the number of trousers. For example, if the ratio is 9: something, then the number of trousers is 9. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is misworded and the options are the number of shirts, but the options are all about the number of trousers. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to re-express the problem.\n\nTotal expenditure: 810 = 70*T +30*S, where T is number of trousers, S is number of shirts.\n\nWe need to maximize T. So find maximum T where 70*T \u2264810.\n\nAs earlier, T=11, then 810-770=40. So S=40//30=1. So S=1.\n\nSo the ratio T:S is 11:1.\n\nBut the options are numbers of T, so perhaps the correct option is E)11 Trousers. So the ratio is 11:1, but the options are about T, so E is the correct choice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are the ratios expressed as the number of trousers. But that doesn't make sense because the ratio requires two numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is phrased incorrectly. Maybe the options are the possible ratios, but presented as the number of trousers. For example, option A is 9:1, but written as 9 Trousers. But that's not how the options are presented.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio is T:S = 9:1, but T is 9. That would require that 9*70 +1*30=630+30=660, which is under 810. So that's possible, but that's not the maximum T.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not about the ratio but the number of shirts. But in that case, the correct answer is 1, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake in considering the maximum number of trousers. Let me check again.\n\nWhat's 810 divided by 70? Let's compute:\n\n70 * 10 = 700. 810-700=110. So with 110 left, can buy 3 shirts (3*30=90), leaving 20. So 10 trousers and 3 shirts: total cost 700+90=790, under 810. Alternatively, 11 trousers and 1 shirt: 770+30=800, under 810. Or 11 trousers and 1 shirt, plus 10 left, which isn't enough for another shirt. So 11 is the maximum.\n\nBut the problem is that the ratio is 11:1, but the options are about the number of trousers. So perhaps the correct answer is E)11 Trousers, which is the maximum number, and the ratio is 11:1, but since the options don't present the ratio, perhaps the question is intended to find the maximum number of trousers, which is E.\n\nWait, but the question is specifically about the ratio, not the number of trousers. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options. Maybe the options are the possible ratios, written as the number of trousers to shirts. But how would that work?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of shirts, but that's not the case. Hmm.\n\nWait, another approach: Perhaps the ratio is to be calculated as the total money spent on trousers to shirts. But that would be 70*T :30*S. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the ratio of trouser to shirt when maximum number is purchased. So the ratio is the count of trouser to shirt, which is 11:1. So the ratio is 11:1, but the options are only numbers. So perhaps the correct answer is E)11 Trousers, but the question is about the ratio. I'm getting a bit stuck here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the number of shirts when maximum trousers are bought, which is 1, but that's not an option. So perhaps the options are the possible ratios, but written as the number of trousers. For example, if the ratio is 9: something, then the number of trousers is 9. But in that case, the answer would be 9, but that's not the case here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the number of shirts, which would be 1, but the options don't include that. So perhaps the question is miswritten, and the options are the number of shirts. But that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me double-check.\n\nTotal money: 810.\n\nMaximum T = 11, because 11*70=770 \u2264810.\n\nRemaining: 810-770=40.\n\nNumber of shirts S =40//30=1. So S=1.\n\nSo the ratio is 11:1. So the ratio is 11 to 1.\n\nBut the options are the number of trousers. So perhaps the correct answer is E)11 Trousers, which is the maximum number. So the answer is E.\n\nWait, but the question is about the ratio, not the number. So perhaps the answer is E because that's when the maximum number of trousers is bought, and the ratio is 11:1, but the options only give the number of trousers. I think I'm overcomplicating. The correct approach is to find the maximum T, which is 11, and the ratio is 11:1. So the answer is E)11 Trousers.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The man spends a total of 810 rupees, with each trouser costing 70 rupees and each shirt costing 30 rupees.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the maximum number of trousers\nThe maximum number of trousers is the largest integer such that the total cost does not exceed 810 rupees. This is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Maximum number of trousers} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{810}{70} \\right\\rfloor = 11\n\\]\n\nThus, the man can buy **11 trousers**.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the remaining money after buying trousers\nThe cost of 11 trousers is:\n\n\\[\n11 \\times 70 = 770 \\, \\text{rupees}\n\\]\n\nThe remaining money is:\n\n\\[\n810 - 770 = 40 \\, \\text{rupees}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the number of shirts\nWith the remaining 40 rupees, the man can buy shirts at 30 rupees each. The number of shirts is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of shirts} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{30} \\right\\rfloor = 1\n\\]\n\nThus, the man can buy **1 shirt**.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the ratio of trousers to shirts\nThe ratio of trousers to shirts is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = 11 : 1\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Match the answer to the options\nThe question asks for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. However, the options only provide the number of trousers. Since the maximum number of trousers is **11**, the correct answer is:\n\n**E) 11 Trousers**\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe ratio of trousers to shirts is **11:1**, and the maximum number of trousers purchased is 11. Therefore, the correct option is:\n\n**Answer: E**",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it. A man spends 810 rupees buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options given are A to E, each giving a number of trousers, but wait, no, looking again, the options are A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. Wait, wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Oh, no, the options are the possible numbers of trousers he could buy. So each option is the number of trousers. So we're to find the maximum number of trousers he can buy with 810, and then find the ratio of trousers to shirts in that case.\n\nWait, but the problem says the ratio of trouser to shirt when maximum number of trouser is purchased. So I think the steps are: find how many trousers he can buy maximally, then see how many shirts he can buy with the remaining money, then find the ratio.\n\nSo first, let's figure out how many trousers he can buy with 810. Each trouser is 70. So maximum number is the largest integer less than or equal to 810 divided by 70.\n\nLet me calculate 70 times 11: 70*11=770. 70*12=840 which is more than 810. So 11 is too much. So maximum is 11? Wait, wait, 70*11=770, which is under 810. So 11 is possible. Wait, but 70*11=770, so he's spent 770 on trousers, leaving 810-770=40. Now, shirts are 30 each. Can he buy any shirts with 40? 40 divided by 30 is 1 with 10 remaining. So he can buy 1 shirt, but that's only 30, leaving 10 which isn't enough for another shirt. So the number of shirts is 1.\n\nSo the ratio of trousers to shirts is 11:1. Wait, but looking at the options, the options are A)9, B)8, etc. Wait, the options are the number of trousers, not the ratio. So the question is, what is the ratio, but the options give the number of trousers. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the question says: What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased? So the ratio is between the number of trousers and shirts. So if he buys 11 trousers, how many shirts can he buy? Let me recheck the math.\n\nTotal money: 810.\n\nIf he buys 11 trousers: 11 *70=770. So 810-770=40 left. Each shirt is 30, so 40/30 is 1.333. So he can buy 1 shirt, as he can't buy a fraction. So number of shirts is 1. So the ratio is 11:1. But wait, the options are A to E, each being a number of trousers. So I'm a bit confused. Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous.

Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the remaining money. Let me double-check.\n\n11 trousers cost 770. 810-770=40. Shirts are 30 each. 40 divided by 30 is 1.333, so 1 shirt. So that's correct.\n\nBut if the question is about the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts, which is 11:1. But the options are numbers of trousers, so perhaps the ratio is 11:1, but the options don't present that.

Let's compute it exactly.\n\n70 times 11 is 770. 70 *11.571 would be 810. But he can't buy a fraction. So maximum is 11.\n\nSo perhaps the ratio is 11:1, but the options are E)11 Trousers.

But that's not how the options are presented.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio is T:S = 9:1, but T is 9. That would require that 9*70 +1*30=630+30=660, which is under 810. So that's possible, but that's not the maximum T.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not about the ratio but the number of shirts. But in that case, the correct answer is 1, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake in considering the maximum number of trousers. Let me check again.\n\nWhat's 810 divided by 70? Let's compute:\n\n70 * 10 = 700. 810-700=110. So with 110 left, can buy 3 shirts (3*30=90), leaving 20. So 10 trousers and 3 shirts: total cost 700+90=790, under 810. Alternatively, 11 trousers and 1 shirt: 770+30=800, under 810. Or 11 trousers and 1 shirt, plus 10 left, which isn't enough for another shirt. So 11 is the maximum.\n\nBut the problem is that the ratio is 11:1, but the options are about the number of trousers. So perhaps the correct answer is E)11 Trousers, which is the maximum number, and the ratio is 11:1, but since the options don't present the ratio, perhaps the question is intended to find the maximum number of trousers, which is E.\n\nWait, but the question is specifically about the ratio, not the number of trousers.

But how would that work?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of shirts, but that's not the case. Hmm.\n\nWait, another approach: Perhaps the ratio is to be calculated as the total money spent on trousers to shirts. But that would be 70*T :30*S. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the ratio of trouser to shirt when maximum number is purchased. So the ratio is the count of trouser to shirt, which is 11:1.

But in that case, the answer would be 9, but that's not the case here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the number of shirts, which would be 1, but the options don't include that. So perhaps the question is miswritten, and the options are the number of shirts. But that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

So the ratio is 11 to 1.\n\nBut the options are the number of trousers. So perhaps the correct answer is E)11 Trousers, which is the maximum number. So the answer is E.\n\nWait, but the question is about the ratio, not the number. So perhaps the answer is E because that's when the maximum number of trousers is bought, and the ratio is 11:1, but the options only give the number of trousers. I think I'm overcomplicating. The correct approach is to find the maximum T, which is 11, and the ratio is 11:1. So the answer is E)11 Trousers.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The man spends a total of 810 rupees, with each trouser costing 70 rupees and each shirt costing 30 rupees.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the maximum number of trousers\nThe maximum number of trousers is the largest integer such that the total cost does not exceed 810 rupees. This is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Maximum number of trousers} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{810}{70} \\right\\rfloor = 11\n\\]\n\nThus, the man can buy **11 trousers**.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the remaining money after buying trousers\nThe cost of 11 trousers is:\n\n\\[\n11 \\times 70 = 770 \\, \\text{rupees}\n\\]\n\nThe remaining money is:\n\n\\[\n810 - 770 = 40 \\, \\text{rupees}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the number of shirts\nWith the remaining 40 rupees, the man can buy shirts at 30 rupees each. The number of shirts is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of shirts} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{30} \\right\\rfloor = 1\n\\]\n\nThus, the man can buy **1 shirt**.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the ratio of trousers to shirts\nThe ratio of trousers to shirts is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = 11 : 1\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Match the answer to the options\nThe question asks for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. However, the options only provide the number of trousers. Since the maximum number of trousers is **11**, the correct answer is:\n\n**E) 11 Trousers**\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe ratio of trousers to shirts is **11:1**, and the maximum number of trousers purchased is 11. Therefore, the correct option is:\n\n**Answer: E**",

So the correct option is E)11 Trousers. So the answer is E.\n\nBut wait, let me check another way. If he buys 11 trousers, that's 770, leaving 40. He can buy one shirt for 30, leaving 10, which isn't enough for another shirt. So yes, 11 trousers and 1 shirt.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another combination where he buys more shirts and fewer trousers but ends up with a higher x? No, because we're maximizing x, so we take the maximum possible x regardless of y.\n\nAnother approach: Let's check each option to see if the total cost is within 810.\n\nOption E: 11 trousers. 11*70=770. Then 810-770=40. So shirts can be 1, total cost 770+30=800. So that's correct.\n\nWhat about option C:10 trousers. 10*70=700. Remaining 110. 110/30=3.666, so 3 shirts. 3*30=90. Total 700+90=790, which is under 810. So that's possible. But since 11 is more than 10, the maximum is 11.\n\nWait, but could there be a higher x beyond 11? Let's see. 70*12=840, which is over 810, so no.\n\nSo the maximum x is 11, and the ratio is 11:1. So the answer is E.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of trousers the man can purchase with 810 rupees, given that each trouser costs 70 rupees and each shirt costs 30 rupees. The ratio of trousers to shirts is then calculated based on the maximum number of trousers and the corresponding number of shirts that can be bought with the remaining money.\n\n1. **Maximizing the number of trousers**:  \n   The cost of one trouser is 70 rupees. To find the maximum number of trousers, divide the total budget (810 rupees) by the cost of one trouser:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Maximum number of trousers} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{810}{70} \\right\\rfloor = 11\n   \\]  \n   This means the man can buy 11 trousers, which costs:  \n   \\[\n   11 \\times 70 = 770 \\, \\text{rupees}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculating the number of shirts**:  \n   After purchasing 11 trousers, the remaining budget is:  \n   \\[\n   810 - 770 = 40 \\, \\text{rupees}\n   \\]  \n   Each shirt costs 30 rupees, so the number of shirts that can be bought is:  \n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{30} \\right\\rfloor = 1 \\, \\text{shirt}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determining the ratio**:  \n   The ratio of trousers to shirts is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Ratio} = 11 : 1\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verifying the options**:  \n   The options only provide the number of trousers. Since the maximum number of trousers is 11, the correct answer is **E) 11 Trousers**.\n\nAnswer: E",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked. \n\nThe question says a man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. Each trouser costs 70 rupees and each shirt is 30 rupees. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers possible.\n\nHmm, wait. So the man wants to buy as many trousers as he can with 810 rupees. But he's also buying shirts, so I guess he's spending some amount on shirts as well. The total expenditure is 810.\n\nI think I should set this up with variables. Let's say the number of trousers he buys is T, and the number of shirts is S. Each trouser is 70, so the total cost for trousers is 70*T. Each shirt is 30, so shirts cost 30*S. The sum of these should be 810.\n\nSo the equation would be 70T + 30S = 810.\n\nOur goal is to maximize T, the number of trousers. That means we need to find the maximum integer value of T such that (810 - 70T) is divisible by 30, because S has to be an integer as well\u2014you can't buy a fraction of a shirt.\n\nWait, right. Because 30S must equal 810 minus 70T, so 810 -70T must be divisible by 30. Let me think about that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express S in terms of T. So, rearranging the equation:\n\n30S = 810 - 70T\n\nDivide both sides by 10 to simplify:\n\n3S = 81 -7T\n\nSo,\n\n3S = 81 -7T\n\nThen,\n\nS = (81 -7T)/3\n\nS must be an integer, so (81 -7T) must be divisible by 3. Let's think about the divisibility by 3.\n\nA number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. But 81 is already 9*9, so 81 is divisible by 3. So 81 divided by 3 is 27.\n\nSo 81 -7T must be a multiple of 3. Let's write that as:\n\n(81 -7T) mod 3 = 0.\n\nSince 81 mod 3 is 0, because 81 is 3^4. So:\n\n(0 -7T) mod 3 = 0 \u2192 (-7T) mod3 =0.\n\nWhich is the same as (7T) mod3 =0.\n\nBut 7 mod3 is 1 (since 7=3*2 +1). So:\n\n(1 * T) mod3 =0 \u2192 T mod3=0.\n\nSo T must be a multiple of 3. That's an important point.\n\nNow, since we're trying to maximize T, let's find the maximum T such that 70T is less than or equal to 810.\n\nSo maximum T without considering shirts would be 810 /70. Let's compute that.\n\n70*11 is 770, which is less than 810. 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So maximum possible T without considering shirts is 11. But wait, because buying shirts affects this.\n\nWait, but the total amount is fixed. So, when he buys more trousers, he has less money left for shirts. So the maximum T is the largest integer such that 70T \u2264810 and (810 -70T) is divisible by 30, because S must be integer.\n\nWait, earlier I thought about it in terms of 30S, but perhaps another approach is to see the possible T values that are multiples of 3, starting from the maximum possible and going down until (810 -70T) is non-negative and divisible by 30.\n\nWait, no. Wait, earlier conclusion was that T must be a multiple of 3. So T can be 3,6,9,12, but 12 is too high because 70*12=840>810.\n\nSo possible T values are 9, 6, etc.\n\nWait, but wait: 70*11 is 770, which is less than 810. So 11 is possible, but earlier I thought T has to be a multiple of 3. But 11 isn't a multiple of 3. So, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no. Let me go back. The equation was 3S =81 -7T. So 81 -7T must be divisible by 3. So, 7T must leave a remainder of 0 when subtracted from 81.\n\nWait, 7T mod3: since 7 mod3 is 1, so 7T mod3 is T mod3. So 81 mod3 is 0, so 7T must be congruent to 81 mod3, which is 0. So 7T mod3 =0 \u2192 T mod3=0. So T must be a multiple of 3. So T can be 3,6,9, etc.\n\nBut 70*9=630. Then 810-630=180. 180/30=6. So S=6. That works.\n\nIf T=12, 70*12=840>810, so not possible.\n\nWhat about T=11? Then 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40 divided by 30 is 1.333..., which isn't an integer. So S can't be 1.333. So T=11 is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, T=10: 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110/30=3.666..., not integer. So no.\n\nT=9: 70*9=630. 810-630=180 \u2192 180/30=6. So S=6. That's valid.\n\nWhat about T=12? No, as above.\n\nWait, but T must be a multiple of 3. So T could be 9,6,3.\n\nBut we need maximum T, so T=9 is the maximum possible that is a multiple of 3 and 70T \u2264810.\n\nWait, but wait: what about T=10? Let me check again. T=10 is not a multiple of 3, but let's see:\n\nIf T=10: 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666... which is not an integer. So S would not be an integer, which is impossible.\n\nSo T=9 is the maximum possible. So the number of trousers is 9, and shirts is 6.\n\nSo the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6, which can be simplified to 3:2.\n\nBut the question is asking for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the ratio is 9:6, but looking at the options, the options are only giving the number of trousers.\n\nWait, the options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11.\n\nSo the correct number of trousers is 9. So the answer would be option A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me try all possible T values that are multiples of 3 and see which one gives the maximum.\n\nT=9: 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6 shirts. So that's valid.\n\nT=12: 70*12=840>810 \u2192 no.\n\nT=15: 70*15=1050>810 \u2192 no.\n\nSo the next possible is T=9.\n\nWait, but what about T=10, which isn't a multiple of 3? Let me check again.\n\nT=10: 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3 with remainder 20. So no, can't have 3 shirts and 20 rupees left, which isn't possible.\n\nSo yes, T=9 is the maximum possible.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. The question says that a man spends 810 rupees buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are A to E, with each giving a number of trousers. \n\nHmm, wait, the question is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again. Oh, wait, the ratio of trousers and shirts when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So he's trying to buy as many trousers as possible within 810 rupees, and then find how many shirts he can buy with the remaining money. Then, the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts would be determined.\n\nSo, the approach is to maximize the number of trousers first. Each trouser costs 70, shirts are 30. Total money is 810.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. To maximize the number of trousers, he should buy as many as possible without exceeding 810. So, divide 810 by 70. Let's see: 70 times 11 is 770, which is under 810. 70*12 is 840, which is over. So maximum number of trousers he can buy is 11. Wait, but wait, let me check the options. The options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11. So option E is 11. But wait, let's not jump to conclusions. Let me do the math properly.\n\nSo, 70 * 11 = 770. 810 - 770 = 40. So he has 40 left. Now, each shirt is 30. So how many shirts can he buy with 40? 30*1=30, which leaves 10, which isn't enough for another shirt. So he can buy 1 shirt. So the number of trousers is 11, shirts is 1. So the ratio is 11:1. But wait, the question asks for the ratio of trousers to shirts. So 11:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, the options are giving only the number of trousers. Wait, no, wait, the options are A)9 Trousers, etc., but the question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when maximum number of trousers is purchased.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. The question says that a man spends 810 rupees buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are A to E, with each giving a number of trousers. \n\nHmm, wait, the question is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again. Oh, wait, the ratio of trousers and shirts when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So he's trying to buy as many trousers as possible within 810 rupees, and then find how many shirts he can buy with the remaining money. Then, the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts would be determined.\n\nSo, the approach is to maximize the number of trousers first. Each trouser costs 70, shirts are 30. Total money is 810.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. To maximize the number of trousers, he should buy as many as possible without exceeding 810. So, divide 810 by 70. Let's see: 70 times 11 is 770, which is under 810. 70*12 is 840, which is over. So maximum number of trousers he can buy is 11. Wait, but wait, let me check the options. The options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11. So option E is 11. But wait, let's not jump to conclusions. Let me do the math properly.\n\nSo, 70 * 11 = 770. 810 - 770 = 40. So he has 40 left. Now, each shirt is 30. So how many shirts can he buy with 40? 30*1=30, which leaves 10, which isn't enough for another shirt. So he can buy 1 shirt. So the number of trousers is 11, shirts is 1. So the ratio is 11:1. But wait, the question asks for the ratio of trousers to shirts. So 11:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, the options are giving only the number of trousers.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So the question is about a man who spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. Trousers are 70 each, shirts are 30 each. And the question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are A to E, each giving a certain number of trousers, which I think represents the possible maximum number.\n\nWait, no, the options are just the number of trousers, but the question is about the ratio. Hmm, wait, maybe the options are the possible maximum number of trousers, and I need to find which one is correct. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question says, \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So the ratio is the key here. But looking at the options, they are all single numbers, like 9, 8, etc., which might be the number of trousers. Hmm, perhaps the options are the maximum number of trousers he can buy, and from that, we can find the ratio.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's break it down. The man spends a total of 810 rupees. He buys some number of trousers and shirts. Each trouser costs 70, each shirt 30. We need to find the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum possible number of trousers.\n\nSo, the key here is to maximize the number of trousers. That would mean buying as many trousers as possible with 810, and then seeing how much is left for shirts.\n\nLet me think. Let's denote the number of trousers as t and shirts as s. So the total cost is 70t + 30s = 810.\n\nWe need to maximize t. So let's find the maximum integer t such that 70t is less than or equal to 810.\n\nCalculating 70t <=810 \u2192 t <= 810/70. Let me compute that. 70 times 11 is 770. 70*12=840, which is more than 810. So the maximum t is 11, but wait, 11*70=770. Then the remaining money is 810-770=40. Now, 40 divided by 30 is 1.333... So you can't buy a fraction of a shirt, so s would be 1. But wait, 30*1=30, which leaves 10 rupees, which isn't enough for another shirt. So in that case, t=11 and s=1. But wait, that's 770 + 30 =800, so 10 rupees are left unused. But the problem says he spends 810, so he must spend all the money. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the problem allows for some leftover money, but I'm not sure. Let's see. So if t=11, then the remaining is 40, which isn't enough for another shirt (since 30 is needed). So s would be 1, but 30*1=30. So 70*11=770, 30*1=30. Total is 800, which is less than 810. So that's not using all the money. So that can't be right.\n\nHmm, maybe I should look for t and s such that 70t +30s=810, and t is as large as possible.\n\nSo let me think about this. Let's solve for s in terms of t.\n\n70t +30s =810 \u2192 30s=810-70t \u2192 s=(810-70t)/30 \u2192 s=27 - (7t)/3.\n\nSince s must be an integer (can't buy a fraction of a shirt), (7t)/3 must be an integer. So 7t must be divisible by 3. Since 7 and 3 are coprime, t must be a multiple of 3. So t can be 3,6,9,12, etc., but considering t can't be more than 810/70=11.57, so maximum possible t is 11. So t must be a multiple of 3, up to 11. The multiples of 3 less than or equal to 11 are 3,6,9.\n\nWait, but 9 is 9. Let me check t=9.\n\nAt t=9, 70*9=630. Remaining money is 810-630=180. So 180/30=6 shirts. So s=6.\n\nSo t=9, s=6.\n\nThe ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nBut wait, are there higher t values that are multiples of 3? Let's see. Next multiple is 12, but 12*70=840 which is more than 810. So t can't be 12.\n\nSo the maximum t is 9.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried t=11, I got s=1, but that leaves 10 rupees, which isn't enough for another shirt. So that's not a valid solution because the total spent would be 770 +30=800, which is less than 810. So that's not acceptable. So t=11 isn't a valid solution because s would have to be 1, and the total is only 800, not 810.\n\nSo the next possible t is 9, which uses all 810.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me check again. If t=9, 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. So s=6. So total cost is 630+180=810. Perfect. So that's a valid solution.\n\nIs there a higher t than 9 that allows s to be an integer? Let me see. For t=10, let's compute s.\n\nt=10: 70*10=700. Remaining money is 810-700=110. 110/30=3.666..., which is not an integer. So s=3 would require 90, leaving 20, which isn't allowed. So s can't be 3.666, so t=10 isn't a valid solution.\n\nt=11: 70*11=770. Remaining 810-770=40. 40/30=1.333, so s=1, but that's 30, leaving 10, which is invalid. So t=11 isn't allowed.\n\nSo the maximum t is 9, with s=6.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. So the ratio is 3:2.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the options are the number of trousers. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA)9 Trousers\n\nB)8 Trousers\n\nC)10 Trousers\n\nD)7 Trousers\n\nE)11 Trousers\n\nWait, so the options are giving the number of trousers. So the correct number is 9, which is option A. Because when t=9, you can have s=6, and that uses the entire 810.\n\nBut wait, the problem is about the ratio of trousers to shirts. So the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2. But the question's options are giving the number of trousers, not the ratio. Hmm, the way the question is phrased is confusing. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question is: What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\n\nWait, maybe I misread the options. Let me look again.\n\nThe options are A)9 Trousers, etc. So the options are the number of trouser(s), not the ratio. So the question is asking, when you buy the maximum number of trousers possible, what is that number? Because the ratio part is confusing. Or maybe the question is about the ratio, but the options are giving the number of trousers, which I have to compute. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly. Let me re-express it. The man buys some number of trousers and shirts, spending 810. We need to find the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is bought.\n\nSo the ratio would be t:s.\n\nBut the options are giving t, the number of trousers. So perhaps the options are the possible t values, and the correct answer is the t that allows the maximum number, which is 9.\n\nSo the correct option is A)9 Trousers. Because when t=9, s=6, and the ratio is 9:6 (simplifies to 3:2). But the question is about the ratio, but the options are the number of trousers. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, maybe the options are giving the possible ratios, but the way it's written is unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the options are the possible t values, and the correct t is 9, which is option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased as, what is the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts when maximum number of trousers is bought, and the options are the possible ratios, but the options are presented as the number of trousers, which is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are in the form of \"9 Trousers\" meaning that the ratio is 9: something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased as, when the maximum number of trousers is bought, what is the ratio, but the options are the number of trousers, not the ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the problem statement. It says, \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So the ratio is t:s.\n\nBut the options are all single numbers, which don't represent a ratio. So perhaps the options are incorrect, or perhaps the question is phrased differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are giving the ratio in the form of the number of trousers, implying the number of shirts is 1, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.\n\nWe have to find the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So the maximum t is 9, and s is 6. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the options are giving the number of trousers, not the ratio. So perhaps the correct option is A)9 Trousers, because that's the maximum number of trousers possible, and the ratio would be 9:6, which is 3:2.\n\nWait, but the options are the number of trousers, not the ratio. So the correct answer is option A)9 Trousers, because that's the maximum number of trousers he can buy without exceeding the budget, and in that case, the ratio is 3:2.\n\nSo the answer should be A)9.\n",

So you can't buy a fraction of a shirt, so s would be 1. But wait, 30*1=30, which leaves 10 rupees, which isn't enough for another shirt. So in that case, t=11 and s=1. But wait, that's 770 + 30 =800, so 10 rupees are left unused. But the problem says he spends 810, so he must spend all the money. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the problem allows for some leftover money, but I'm not sure. Let's see. So if t=11, then the remaining is 40, which isn't enough for another shirt (since 30 is needed). So s would be 1, but 30*1=30. So 70*11=770, 30*1=30. Total is 800, which is less than 810. So that's not using all the money. So that can't be right.\n\nHmm, maybe I should look for t and s such that 70t +30s=810, and t is as large as possible.\n\nSo let me think about this.

So 7t must be divisible by 3. Since 7 and 3 are coprime, t must be a multiple of 3. So t can be 3,6,9,12, etc., but considering t can't be more than 810/70=11.57, so maximum possible t is 11. So t must be a multiple of 3, up to 11. The multiples of 3 less than or equal to 11 are 3,6,9.\n\nWait, but 9 is 9. Let me check t=9.\n\nAt t=9, 70*9=630. Remaining money is 810-630=180. So 180/30=6 shirts. So s=6.\n\nSo t=9, s=6.\n\nThe ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nBut wait, are there higher t values that are multiples of 3? Let's see. Next multiple is 12, but 12*70=840 which is more than 810. So t can't be 12.\n\nSo the maximum t is 9.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried t=11, I got s=1, but that leaves 10 rupees, which isn't enough for another shirt. So that's not a valid solution because the total spent would be 770 +30=800, which is less than 810. So that's not acceptable. So t=11 isn't a valid solution because s would have to be 1, and the total is only 800, not 810.\n\nSo the next possible t is 9, which uses all 810.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me check again. If t=9, 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. So s=6. So total cost is 630+180=810. Perfect. So that's a valid solution.\n\nIs there a higher t than 9 that allows s to be an integer? Let me see. For t=10, let's compute s.\n\nt=10: 70*10=700. Remaining money is 810-700=110. 110/30=3.666..., which is not an integer. So s=3 would require 90, leaving 20, which isn't allowed. So s can't be 3.666, so t=10 isn't a valid solution.\n\nt=11: 70*11=770. Remaining 810-770=40. 40/30=1.333, so s=1, but that's 30, leaving 10, which is invalid. So t=11 isn't allowed.\n\nSo the maximum t is 9, with s=6.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. So the ratio is 3:2.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the options are the number of trousers. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA)9 Trousers\n\nB)8 Trousers\n\nC)10 Trousers\n\nD)7 Trousers\n\nE)11 Trousers\n\nWait, so the options are giving the number of trousers. So the correct number is 9, which is option A. Because when t=9, you can have s=6, and that uses the entire 810.\n\nBut wait, the problem is about the ratio of trousers to shirts. So the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2. But the question's options are giving the number of trousers, not the ratio. Hmm, the way the question is phrased is confusing. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question is: What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\n\nWait, maybe I misread the options. Let me look again.\n\nThe options are A)9 Trousers, etc. So the options are the number of trouser(s), not the ratio. So the question is asking, when you buy the maximum number of trousers possible, what is that number? Because the ratio part is confusing. Or maybe the question is about the ratio, but the options are giving the number of trousers, which I have to compute. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly. Let me re-express it. The man buys some number of trousers and shirts, spending 810. We need to find the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is bought.\n\nSo the ratio would be t:s.\n\nBut the options are giving t, the number of trousers. So perhaps the options are the possible t values, and the correct answer is the t that allows the maximum number, which is 9.\n\nSo the correct option is A)9 Trousers. Because when t=9, s=6, and the ratio is 9:6 (simplifies to 3:2). But the question is about the ratio, but the options are the number of trousers. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, maybe the options are giving the possible ratios, but the way it's written is unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the options are the possible t values, and the correct t is 9, which is option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased as, what is the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts when maximum number of trousers is bought, and the options are the possible ratios, but the options are presented as the number of trousers, which is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are in the form of \"9 Trousers\" meaning that the ratio is 9: something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased as, when the maximum number of trousers is bought, what is the ratio, but the options are the number of trousers, not the ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the problem statement. It says, \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So the ratio is t:s.\n\nBut the options are all single numbers, which don't represent a ratio. So perhaps the options are incorrect, or perhaps the question is phrased differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are giving the ratio in the form of the number of trousers, implying the number of shirts is 1, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.\n\nWe have to find the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So the maximum t is 9, and s is 6. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the options are giving the number of trousers, not the ratio. So perhaps the correct option is A)9 Trousers, because that's the maximum number of trousers possible, and the ratio would be 9:6, which is 3:2.\n\nWait, but the options are the number of trousers, not the ratio. So the correct answer is option A)9 Trousers, because that's the maximum number of trousers he can buy without exceeding the budget, and in that case, the ratio is 3:2.\n\nSo the answer should be A)9.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The man spends a total of 810 rupees, with each trouser costing 70 rupees and each shirt costing 30 rupees. \n\nLet the number of trousers be \\( t \\) and the number of shirts be \\( s \\). The total cost equation is:\n\n\\[\n70t + 30s = 810\n\\]\n\nTo maximize \\( t \\), we solve for the largest integer \\( t \\) such that \\( 70t \\leq 810 \\). Dividing 810 by 70 gives:\n\n\\[\nt \\leq \\frac{810}{70} \\approx 11.57\n\\]\n\nThus, the maximum possible integer value for \\( t \\) is 11. However, substituting \\( t = 11 \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[\n70(11) = 770 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 810 - 770 = 40\n\\]\n\nThe remaining 40 rupees can only afford \\( s = 1 \\) shirt (since \\( 30 \\times 1 = 30 \\)), leaving 10 rupees unused. Since the problem implies that the total amount spent is 810 rupees, \\( t = 11 \\) is not valid.\n\nNext, we check \\( t = 9 \\):\n\n\\[\n70(9) = 630 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 810 - 630 = 180\n\\]\n\nThe remaining 180 rupees can afford \\( s = 6 \\) shirts (since \\( 30 \\times 6 = 180 \\)). This uses the entire budget, making \\( t = 9 \\) and \\( s = 6 \\) a valid solution. The ratio of trousers to shirts is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{t}{s} = \\frac{9}{6} = 3:2\n\\]\n\nThe question asks for the number of trousers when the maximum number is purchased. The maximum valid \\( t \\) is 9, which corresponds to option A.\n\nAnswer: A",

Let me calculate that.\n\n70 times 11 is 770 because 70*10=700 and 70*11=770. 70*12 is 840 which is more than 810. So he can't buy 12. So the maximum is 11? Wait, but 70*11 is 770. Then he has 810-770=40 left. Can he buy shirts with 40? Each shirt is 30. 40 divided by 30 is 1 with 10 remaining. So he can buy 1 shirt and have 10 rupees left, which isn't enough for another shirt. So the number of shirts is 1.\n\nWait, but 40 is the remaining money after buying 11 trousers. 30 per shirt. 40/30 is 1.333... So he can buy one shirt, leaving 10. So the number of shirts is 1.\n\nSo the ratio of trousers to shirts is 11:1.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 11 Trousers. So the ratio is 11:1. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, 11 trousers cost 70 *11 = 770. 810-770=40. 40 divided by 30 is 1.333. So he can buy 1 shirt, 30, leaving 10. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps buying one less trouser might allow for more shirts, but the question specifies the maximum number of trousers.

So total is 800, but he spent 810. So no, that's not right. Wait, no, 770+30=800, but he has 810, so he could maybe buy another shirt? No, because 800 +30 is 830 which is over 810. So 11 trousers and 1 shirt is 800. He's left with 10. So that's the maximum number of trousers.\n\nAlternatively, if he buys 10 trousers, that's 70*10=700. Remaining money is 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3 with 20 left. So he can buy 3 shirts. So ratio would be 10:3.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. \n\nThe question says a man spends 810 rupees buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers possible. The options are A to E, each giving a number of trousers, but I think the actual ratio might be more than just the number, but perhaps the ratio in terms of their quantities.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the question says, \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" Hmm, so maybe the ratio is the number of trousers to the number of shirts when he buys as many trousers as possible without exceeding 810 rupees. \n\nSo, the goal is to maximize the number of trousers. So, he should buy as many as he can with 810, and then see how much money is left, which would be spent on shirts. Then, the ratio is the number of trousers to shirts.\n\nLet me think. So, the cost of one trouser is 70, shirts are 30 each. He has 810 rupees.\n\nLet's denote the number of trousers as t and shirts as s. So, the total cost equation would be:\n\n70t + 30s = 810\n\nWe need to maximize t, which means we want as many t as possible without making the total exceed 810. \n\nSo, to maximize t, s should be as small as possible, ideally zero. But if 70t exceeds 810, then s can't be zero. So, let's see what's the maximum t such that 70t \u2264 810.\n\nCalculating 810 divided by 70. Let me do that: 70*11 is 770, because 70*10 is 700, plus 70 is 770. 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So the maximum t is 11, but wait, 70*11 is 770. Then the remaining money is 810 -770 =40. \n\nBut shirts are 30 each. So with 40 rupees, can he buy shirts? 30*1=30, which would leave 10, but that's not enough for another shirt. So he can buy 1 shirt, spending 30, and have 10 left, which isn't enough for anything else. \n\nWait, but the problem says he spends all 810 on both items. So he must buy some shirts. So, he can't buy 11 trousers and 0 shirts because that would be 770, leaving 40, but that's not allowed. He needs to spend exactly 810.\n\nSo, 70t +30s =810.\n\nWe can rearrange this as:\n\n30s =810 -70t\n\nSo, 810 -70t must be divisible by 30, because s has to be an integer.\n\nSo, let's see. Let me try t=11. Then 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40 divided by 30 is 1.333... which is not an integer. So s=1.333, which isn't possible. So t=11 is not possible because s would have to be fractional, which isn't allowed. So, we can't have t=11. \n\nSo, next, t=10. Let's see: 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110/30 is 3.666... Also not an integer. So s=3.666, which isn't possible.\n\nNext, t=9: 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. So s=6. That's an integer. So this works. So, t=9, s=6. \n\nWait, but can we go higher than t=9? Because t=10 didn't work, but maybe t=11 is impossible, so next is t=9. \n\nWait, but I thought t=11 gives s=1.333, which isn't allowed. So t=9 is the maximum possible where s is an integer. \n\nSo, the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6. Simplifying that, both divided by 3, it becomes 3:2. But the question is asking for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased, which is 9. So the ratio is 9:6, but perhaps the question expects the number of trousers, which is option A, 9.\n\nWait, but the options are given as A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. So the question is, when the maximum number of trousers is bought, what is the ratio of trousers to shirts. So the ratio is 9:6, but the question is asking for the ratio, but the options are numbers of trousers. Hmm, wait, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again.\n\nThe question says: What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is just the number of trousers to shirts, which is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the options don't present ratios; they present numbers of trousers. So perhaps the question is phrased a bit differently. Wait, perhaps the options are giving the number of trousers in the ratio, but I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is the number of trousers to the number of shirts. So in the case where t=9 and s=6, the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2. So, the ratio is 3:2. But the options don't have this. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of trousers when maximum is bought, which is 9, so the answer is option A.\n\nWait, but the question is about the ratio of trousers to shirts, not the number of trousers. So maybe the answer is 3:2, but that's not one of the options. The options are all about the number of trousers.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in my approach. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of trousers when the maximum is bought, regardless of the shirts. So the maximum number of trousers is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried t=11, the remaining money was 40, which isn't enough to buy another shirt, but he must spend all 810. So t=11 isn't possible because s would have to be 1.333, which isn't allowed. So t=9 is the maximum possible, with s=6.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2. But the options don't have this ratio.

Hmm, maybe I should read the question again.\n\nThe question says, \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\"\n\nSo, perhaps the ratio is the ratio between the number of trousers and shirts, which is 9:6, or 3:2. But the options don't list ratios; they list the number of trousers. So perhaps the question is asking for the number of trousers, which is 9, option A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is being misinterpreted. Perhaps the problem is asking for the ratio of money spent on trousers to shirts. So, if he buys 9 trousers and 6 shirts, the money spent is 9*70=630 on trousers, and 6*30=180 on shirts. The ratio is 630:180, which simplifies to 7:2. But that's not one of the options either.\n\nWait, but the options are all about the number of trousers.

Thus, \\( t = 10 \\) is not valid.\n\n- For \\( t = 9 \\):  \n  \\[\n  70 \\times 9 = 630 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 810 - 630 = 180\n  \\]  \n  With 180 rupees remaining, \\( s = \\frac{180}{30} = 6 \\), which is an integer.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. \n\nThe question says a man spends 810 rupees buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers possible. The options are A to E, each giving a number of trousers, but I think the actual ratio might be more than just the number, but perhaps the ratio in terms of their quantities.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the question says, \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" Hmm, so maybe the ratio is the number of trousers to the number of shirts when he buys as many trousers as possible without exceeding 810 rupees. \n\nSo, the goal is to maximize the number of trousers. So, he should buy as many as he can with 810, and then see how much money is left, which would be spent on shirts. Then, the ratio is the number of trousers to shirts.\n\nLet me think. So, the cost of one trouser is 70, shirts are 30 each. He has 810 rupees.\n\nLet's denote the number of trousers as t and shirts as s. So, the total cost equation would be:\n\n70t + 30s = 810\n\nWe need to maximize t, which means we want as many t as possible without making the total exceed 810. \n\nSo, to maximize t, s should be as small as possible, ideally zero. But if 70t exceeds 810, then s can't be zero. So, let's see what's the maximum t such that 70t \u2264 810.\n\nCalculating 810 divided by 70. Let me do that: 70*11 is 770, because 70*10 is 700, plus 70 is 770. 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So the maximum t is 11, but wait, 70*11 is 770. Then the remaining money is 810 -770 =40. \n\nBut shirts are 30 each. So with 40 rupees, can he buy shirts? 30*1=30, which would leave 10, but that's not enough for another shirt. So he can buy 1 shirt, spending 30, and have 10 left, which isn't enough for anything else. \n\nWait, but the problem says he spends all 810 on both items. So he must buy some shirts. So, he can't buy 11 trousers and 0 shirts because that would be 770, leaving 40, but that's not allowed. He needs to spend exactly 810.\n\nSo, 70t +30s =810.\n\nWe can rearrange this as:\n\n30s =810 -70t\n\nSo, 810 -70t must be divisible by 30, because s has to be an integer.\n\nSo, let's see. Let me try t=11. Then 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40 divided by 30 is 1.333... which is not an integer. So s=1.333, which isn't possible. So t=11 is not possible because s would have to be fractional, which isn't allowed. So, we can't have t=11. \n\nSo, next, t=10. Let's see: 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110/30 is 3.666... Also not an integer. So s=3.666, which isn't possible.\n\nNext, t=9: 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. So s=6. That's an integer. So this works. So, t=9, s=6. \n\nWait, but can we go higher than t=9? Because t=10 didn't work, but maybe t=11 is impossible, so next is t=9. \n\nWait, but I thought t=11 gives s=1.333, which isn't allowed. So t=9 is the maximum possible where s is an integer. \n\nSo, the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6. Simplifying that, both divided by 3, it becomes 3:2. But the question is asking for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased, which is 9. So the ratio is 9:6, but perhaps the question expects the number of trousers, which is option A, 9.\n\nWait, but the options are given as A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. So the question is, when the maximum number of trousers is bought, what is the ratio of trousers to shirts. So the ratio is 9:6, but the question is asking for the ratio, but the options are numbers of trousers. Hmm, wait, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again.\n\nThe question says: What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is just the number of trousers to shirts, which is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the options don't present ratios; they present numbers of trousers. So perhaps the question is phrased a bit differently. Wait, perhaps the options are giving the number of trousers in the ratio, but I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is the number of trousers to the number of shirts. So in the case where t=9 and s=6, the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2. So, the ratio is 3:2. But the options don't have this. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of trousers when maximum is bought, which is 9, so the answer is option A.\n\nWait, but the question is about the ratio of trousers to shirts, not the number of trousers. So maybe the answer is 3:2, but that's not one of the options. The options are all about the number of trousers.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in my approach. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of trousers when the maximum is bought, regardless of the shirts. So the maximum number of trousers is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried t=11, the remaining money was 40, which isn't enough to buy another shirt, but he must spend all 810. So t=11 isn't possible because s would have to be 1.333, which isn't allowed. So t=9 is the maximum possible, with s=6.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2. But the options don't have this ratio. So perhaps the answer is the number of trousers, which is 9, option A.\n\nWait, but the options are A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. So perhaps the question is just asking for the number of trousers when maximum is bought, which is 9, so answer A.\n\nBut the original question is about the ratio, not the number. Hmm, maybe I should read the question again.\n\nThe question says, \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\"\n\nSo, perhaps the ratio is the ratio between the number of trousers and shirts, which is 9:6, or 3:2. But the options don't list ratios; they list the number of trousers. So perhaps the question is asking for the number of trousers, which is 9, option A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is being misinterpreted. Perhaps the problem is asking for the ratio of money spent on trousers to shirts. So, if he buys 9 trousers and 6 shirts, the money spent is 9*70=630 on trousers, and 6*30=180 on shirts. The ratio is 630:180, which simplifies to 7:2. But that's not one of the options either.\n\nWait, but the options are all about the number of trousers. So perhaps the question is simply asking for the maximum number of trousers he can buy, which is 9, option A.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is A)9 Trousers.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased with 810 rupees, given that each trouser costs 70 rupees and each shirt costs 30 rupees. The total expenditure is represented by the equation:\n\n\\[\n70t + 30s = 810\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( t \\) is the number of trousers and \\( s \\) is the number of shirts. The goal is to maximize \\( t \\), which requires minimizing \\( s \\). \n\n### Step 1: Maximize \\( t \\)\nTo maximize \\( t \\), we start by checking the largest possible integer values for \\( t \\) such that \\( 70t \\leq 810 \\). \n\n- For \\( t = 11 \\):  \n  \\[\n  70 \\times 11 = 770 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 810 - 770 = 40\n  \\]  \n  With 40 rupees remaining, \\( s = \\frac{40}{30} = 1.333 \\), which is not an integer. Thus, \\( t = 11 \\) is not valid.\n\n- For \\( t = 10 \\):  \n  \\[\n  70 \\times 10 = 700 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 810 - 700 = 110\n  \\]  \n  With 110 rupees remaining, \\( s = \\frac{110}{30} = 3.666 \\), which is also not an integer. Thus, \\( t = 10 \\) is not valid.\n\n- For \\( t = 9 \\):  \n  \\[\n  70 \\times 9 = 630 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 810 - 630 = 180\n  \\]  \n  With 180 rupees remaining, \\( s = \\frac{180}{30} = 6 \\), which is an integer.

The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are labeled A to E, each giving a specific number of trousers. Hmm, I think I need to figure out how many of each he buys to maximize the number of trousers without exceeding his total budget.\n\nWait, let's break it down. The total amount is 810. Each trouser is 70, shirt is 30. Let me denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S. So the equation would be 70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nThe goal is to maximize T, right? So I need to find the maximum possible integer value of T such that the remaining money can be spent on shirts, which means 30 must divide the remaining amount.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation. Let's subtract 70*T from both sides: 30*S = 810 - 70*T. So S = (810 - 70*T)/30. Since S must be an integer, (810 -70T) must be divisible by 30.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it as 810 -70T must be a multiple of 30. Let me factor 70 into 30. 70 is 30*2 +10. Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to see what 70T must be less than or equal to 810, and when you subtract it from 810, the result is divisible by 30.\n\nSo, 70*T \u2264 810 \u2192 T \u2264 810/70. Let me calculate that. 70 * 11 is 770, 70*12 is 840. So 810 is between 70*11 and 70*12. So T can be at most 11, but wait, let me check if 70*11 leaves a remainder that's a multiple of 30.\n\n70 * 11 = 770. 810 -770 =40. 40 divided by 30 is 1.333... which is not an integer. So that's not possible. So T=11 doesn't work because S would have to be 40/30, which is 4/3, not an integer. So T=11 is not possible.\n\nNext, try T=10. 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666... no, that's not an integer either. So T=10 is out.\n\nWait, maybe I should check T=9. 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. That's an integer. So S=6. So T=9, S=6. That's one possibility.\n\nBut wait, could there be a higher T? Let's check T=8. 70*8=560. 810-560=250. 250/30 is 8.333... Not an integer. So no.\n\nT=7: 70*7=490. 810-490=320. 320/30 is about 10.666... Not integer.\n\nHmm, so T=9 works. Let me see if any higher T than 9 works. Wait, earlier I thought T=11 gives 40, which is not divisible by 30. T=10 gives 110, which is not either. So the next possible lower T is 9, which gives 180, which works.\n\nSo the maximum number of trousers is 9. Then the ratio is T:S =9:6. Which can be simplified to 3:2. But the question is about the ratio when maximum T is bought. So the options are about how many T, not the ratio. Wait, the options are A to E, each giving a number of trousers. The question says \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\"\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Oh, no, the options are giving the number of trousers as possible answers. So the correct answer is A)9 Trousers.\n\nWait, let me make sure. So T=9, S=6. So the ratio is 9:6, which reduces to 3:2.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe problem says a man spends 810 rupees buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are A to E, each giving a number of trousers, so I guess the ratio is based on that maximum number.\n\nHmm, wait, the question says the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So I think that means we need to maximize the number of trousers he can buy with 810 rupees. Because if he buys more trousers, the number of shirts will be less, and the ratio will be higher. So the idea is to buy as many trousers as possible without exceeding the total amount.\n\nLet me jot down what I know:\n\nTotal money spent: 810 Rs\nCost per trouser: 70 Rs\nCost per shirt: 30 Rs\n\nLet me denote the number of trousers as t and shirts as s. So the equation would be:\n\n70t + 30s = 810\n\nWe need to maximize t, so we have to find the maximum integer t such that 70t is less than or equal to 810. Wait, but also, the remaining money after buying t trousers must be divisible by 30, so that s is an integer.\n\nSo, first, find the maximum t where 70t \u2264 810.\n\nLet me compute 810 divided by 70. Let's see, 70*10=700, 70*11=770, 70*12=840. Wait, 840 is more than 810, so the maximum possible t can't be 12. Let's see, 11*70=770. Then 810-770=40. But 40 isn't a multiple of 30. Because 30*1=30, 30*2=60. 40 is in between, so s would be 40/30=1.333, which isn't an integer. So that's a problem. So t=11 isn't possible because it leaves 40, which isn't divisible by 30.\n\nSo next, let's try t=10. 10*70=700. 810-700=110. Now, 110 divided by 30 is 3.666... which is not an integer either. So t=10 isn't valid.\n\nNext, t=9. 9*70=630. 810-630=180. 180 divided by 30 is 6. That's an integer. So t=9, s=6. So the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question is about the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So in this case, t=9 is the maximum possible that allows s to be an integer.\n\nWait, but I thought t=11 gives 770, but 40 isn't divisible by 30. So t can't be 11. What about t=8? Let me check. 8*70=560. 810-560=250. 250 divided by 30 is about 8.333, which isn't an integer. So t=8 isn't valid either.\n\nHmm, so t=9 is the maximum. So the ratio is 9:6, which can be simplified. Let me check if there's a higher t that works. Let's see, what's 70*10=700, 810-700=110, which isn't divisible by 30. 70*11=770, 810-770=40, also not divisible by 30. 70*12=840, which is over 810, so no.\n\nSo t=9 is the maximum possible. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the options given are about the number of trousers, not the ratio. Wait, the options are A)9, B)8, etc., so the answer must be A)9.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number is purchased. So if t=9, then s=6, ratio is 9:6 or 3:2. But the options don't give the ratio, they just give the number of trousers, so the correct option is A)9, which is the number of trousers. So the answer is option A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe problem says a man spends 810 rupees buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are A to E, each giving a number of trousers, so I guess the ratio is based on that maximum number.\n\nHmm, wait, the question says the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So I think that means we need to maximize the number of trousers he can buy with 810 rupees. Because if he buys more trousers, the number of shirts will be less, and the ratio will be higher. So the idea is to buy as many trousers as possible without exceeding the total amount.\n\nLet me jot down what I know:\n\nTotal money spent: 810 Rs\nCost per trouser: 70 Rs\nCost per shirt: 30 Rs\n\nLet me denote the number of trousers as t and shirts as s. So the equation would be:\n\n70t + 30s = 810\n\nWe need to maximize t, so we have to find the maximum integer t such that 70t is less than or equal to 810. Wait, but also, the remaining money after buying t trousers must be divisible by 30, so that s is an integer.\n\nSo, first, find the maximum t where 70t \u2264 810.\n\nLet me compute 810 divided by 70. Let's see, 70*10=700, 70*11=770, 70*12=840. Wait, 840 is more than 810, so the maximum possible t can't be 12. Let's see, 11*70=770. Then 810-770=40. But 40 isn't a multiple of 30. Because 30*1=30, 30*2=60. 40 is in between, so s would be 40/30=1.333, which isn't an integer. So that's a problem. So t=11 isn't possible because it leaves 40, which isn't divisible by 30.\n\nSo next, let's try t=10. 10*70=700. 810-700=110. Now, 110 divided by 30 is 3.666... which is not an integer either. So t=10 isn't valid.\n\nNext, t=9. 9*70=630. 810-630=180. 180 divided by 30 is 6. That's an integer. So t=9, s=6. So the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question is about the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So in this case, t=9 is the maximum possible that allows s to be an integer.\n\nWait, but I thought t=11 gives 770, but 40 isn't divisible by 30. So t can't be 11. What about t=8? Let me check. 8*70=560. 810-560=250. 250 divided by 30 is about 8.333, which isn't an integer. So t=8 isn't valid either.\n\nHmm, so t=9 is the maximum. So the ratio is 9:6, which can be simplified.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where a man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. Trousers are 70 each and shirts are 30 each. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. Hmm, wait, no, actually, the options are giving different numbers of trousers. Oh right, the question is more about finding out how many of each he buys when he gets the maximum possible number of trousers within the 810 rupees.\n\nSo, let's think. He wants to buy as many trousers as possible. Since each trouser costs 70, I should figure out how many he can buy without exceeding 810. But also, the total spending is exactly 810, so the shirts will take up the remaining money.\n\nLet me denote the number of trousers as t and shirts as s. So the total cost equation is 70t + 30s = 810.\n\nHe wants to maximize t, so I need to find the maximum integer t such that (810 -70t) is divisible by 30, because the remaining money must buy a whole number of shirts. Alternatively, (810 -70t) must be >=0, and (810 -70t) must be a multiple of 30.\n\nWait, another approach: since 70t +30s =810, perhaps I can simplify this equation. Let's divide everything by 10 to make it easier: 7t +3s =81.\n\nSo, 7t +3s =81. I need to find integer values t and s such that this holds, and t is as large as possible.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation to solve for s: 3s =81 -7t => s=(81-7t)/3.\n\nSince s must be an integer, (81-7t) must be divisible by 3. Let's see what that implies about t.\n\nLet me think about the divisibility by 3. 81 is divisible by 3, so 7t must also leave a remainder that allows (81-7t) to be divisible by 3.\n\nBut 7 mod 3 is 1, since 7/3 is 2 with remainder 1. So 7t mod3 is equivalent to t mod3. So, (81 -7t) mod3 = (0 - t mod3) mod3. So for (81-7t) to be divisible by 3, t must be congruent to 0 mod3. Because 0 - (t mod3) should be 0 mod3, which implies t mod3 is 0.\n\nSo t has to be a multiple of 3. Let me note that t can be 0,3,6,9,... but t can't be more than 810/70. Let's calculate 810 divided by 70.\n\n70 * 11 is 770, 70*12 is 840 which is more than 810. So maximum possible t is 11, but let me check if 11 is a multiple of 3. 11 divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder of 2, so no. So the next lower multiple of 3 is 9.\n\nWait, but maybe I can check for t=11 first. Let's plug t=11 into the equation.\n\ns=(81 -7*11)/3 = (81 -77)/3 =4/3. That's not an integer, so t=11 is not possible.\n\nNext, t=10. Is 10 a multiple of 3? 10/3 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so no. So s=(81-70)/3 =11/3 \u2248 3.666, which isn't an integer. So t=10 also not possible.\n\nt=9: 9 is a multiple of 3. Let's see s=(81 -63)/3 =18/3=6. So s=6. That works. So with t=9, s=6, total cost is 70*9=630 +30*6=180, 630+180=810, which matches.\n\nBut wait, what about t=9, but maybe there's a higher t possible that also gives an integer s. Let me check t=12: but 70*12=840>810, so that's not possible. So the next lower is t=9.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me see: t=9 is possible, but what about t=8? Because sometimes, even if t isn't a multiple of 3, maybe s can still be an integer.\n\nLet me test t=8. s=(81-7*8)/3 = (81-56)/3 =25/3 \u22488.333. Not integer.\n\nt=7: s=(81-49)/3=32/3\u224810.666, not integer.\n\nt=6: s=(81-42)/3=39/3=13. So t=6, s=13. That's possible, but t=9 is higher.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Because I thought t has to be a multiple of 3 because of the earlier modulo. Let me double-check that.\n\nThe equation is 7t +3s=81.\n\nWe can write this as 7t =81 -3s.\n\nSo 7t must be equal to 81-3s.\n\nBut 81 is divisible by 3, so 3s is divisible by 3, so 7t must be divisible by 3.\n\nWait, 7t must be a multiple of 3. Since 7 and 3 are coprime, t must be a multiple of 3. So t must be 3k, where k is an integer.\n\nSo possible t's are 3,6,9,12,... but t can't be more than 11 (since 70*12=840>810).\n\nSo the maximum t is 9, which gives s=6 as we saw earlier.\n\nWait, but wait another thing: maybe when t is 9, the cost is 70*9=630, and 810-630=180, which buys 6 shirts at 30 each, so 6*30=180. That works.\n\nIs there a way to buy more than 9 trousers? Let's check t=10: 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666, which is not an integer. So no.\n\nt=11: 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40/30 is 1.333, not integer.\n\nSo the maximum t is 9. So the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question is asking for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is bought. Wait, no, the question is phrased a bit differently. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question is: What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\n\nWait, the ratio of trouser to shirt. So 9:6, which reduces to 3:2. But the options don't have that; they have options like 9 Trousers, etc. Wait, no, wait, the options are giving the number of trousers. Wait, looking back:\n\nOptions:\nA)9 Trousers\nB)8 Trousers\nC)10 Trousers\nD)7 Trousers\nE)11 Trousers\n\nWait, no, the options are the number of trousers, but the question is about the ratio. Oh wait, no, the question is phrased as \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So the ratio would be 9:6, but perhaps the question is actually asking for the number of trousers in that scenario, which is 9. So the correct option is A)9 Trousers.\n\nWait, but the question says, \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So the options are the number of trousers, but I think the correct answer is 9. So the answer is A.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. The options are giving numbers of trousers, not the ratio. Oh, maybe the question is phrased incorrectly, perhaps it's asking for the number of trousers. Because the options are all numbers with 'Trousers' as the unit.\n\nSo the correct answer is 9, which is option A.\n",

Oh wait, no, the question is phrased as \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So the ratio would be 9:6, but perhaps the question is actually asking for the number of trousers in that scenario, which is 9. So the correct option is A)9 Trousers.\n\nWait, but the question says, \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So the options are the number of trousers, but I think the correct answer is 9. So the answer is A.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. The options are giving numbers of trousers, not the ratio. Oh, maybe the question is phrased incorrectly, perhaps it's asking for the number of trousers. Because the options are all numbers with 'Trousers' as the unit.\n\nSo the correct answer is 9, which is option A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased within a total budget of 810 rupees, given that each trouser costs 70 rupees and each shirt costs 30 rupees. The total expenditure equation is:\n\n\\[\n70t + 30s = 810\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( t \\) is the number of trousers and \\( s \\) is the number of shirts. To maximize \\( t \\), we simplify the equation by dividing through by 10:\n\n\\[\n7t + 3s = 81\n\\]\n\nRearranging for \\( s \\):\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{81 - 7t}{3}\n\\]\n\nFor \\( s \\) to be an integer, \\( 81 - 7t \\) must be divisible by 3. Since 7 is congruent to 1 modulo 3, \\( t \\) must also be a multiple of 3 to satisfy the divisibility condition. Testing possible values of \\( t \\) (multiples of 3 up to the maximum possible value):\n\n- \\( t = 11 \\): \\( 70 \\times 11 = 770 \\), leaving \\( 810 - 770 = 40 \\), which is not divisible by 30.\n- \\( t = 10 \\): \\( 70 \\times 10 = 700 \\), leaving \\( 810 - 700 = 110 \\), which is not divisible by 30.\n- \\( t = 9 \\): \\( 70 \\times 9 = 630 \\), leaving \\( 810 - 630 = 180 \\), which is divisible by 30, giving \\( s = 6 \\).\n\nThus, the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased is \\( t = 9 \\), with \\( s = 6 \\). The ratio of trousers to shirts is \\( 9:6 \\), but the question asks for the number of trousers when the maximum is purchased. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: A**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says a man spends 810 rupees buying trousers and shirts. Trousers are 70 each, shirts are 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are given as A to E, each with a certain number of trousers.\n\nHmm, so the goal is to maximize the number of trousers he can buy without exceeding his total budget of 810. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, let me think about what variables are involved. Let's say the number of trousers is T and the number of shirts is S. Each trouser costs 70, so the total spent on trousers is 70*T. Each shirt is 30, so shirts cost 30*S. The sum of these should be equal to 810.\n\nSo the equation would be 70T + 30S = 810. I'm supposed to find T and S such that T is as large as possible, and then find the ratio T:S.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So the first step is to find the maximum possible T such that the total cost is 810.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Since the man wants as many trousers as possible, he'll spend as much as he can on them, and the rest on shirts. So I need to find the largest integer T where 70*T is less than or equal to 810. But wait, since the remaining money has to be spent on shirts, which cost 30 each, the remaining money must be divisible by 30. Otherwise, he can't buy a whole number of shirts.\n\nSo let's approach this step by step. Let's find the maximum T such that 70*T <=810 and (810 -70*T) is divisible by 30.\n\nLet me compute 70*T for T as high as possible. Let's see, 810 divided by 70 is approximately 11.57. So the maximum possible T without exceeding 810 is 11. But we need to check if 810 -70*11 is divisible by 30.\n\nCalculating 70*11: 70*10 is 700, plus 70 is 770. So 810-770 is 40. 40 divided by 30 is 1 and 1/3, which isn't a whole number. So T=11 is not possible because he can't buy a fraction of a shirt.\n\nSo we move to T=10. 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3 with a remainder of 20. Because 30*3=90, 110-90=20. So that's not divisible by 30 either. So T=10 isn't possible.\n\nNext, T=9. 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180 divided by 30 is 6. Exactly 6 shirts. So that works. So T=9 and S=6. So the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is bought. Wait, but wait, maybe there's a higher T possible?\n\nWait, earlier I thought T=11 gives 40, which isn't divisible by 30. What about T=8? Let's check. 70*8=560. 810-560=250. 250 divided by 30 is 8 and 10/30, which is 8 and 1/3. Not an integer. So no.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check T=9 is the maximum possible. But let me see if there are other possibilities beyond T=9 but less than 11 where 810-70T is divisible by 30.\n\nLet me try T=12. 70*12=840, which is more than 810, so no.\n\nT=11: 770, 810-770=40 \u2192 not divisible by 30.\n\nT=10:700, 810-700=110 \u2192 110/30=3.666\u2026 Not integer.\n\nT=9:630, 180 \u2192 6 shirts.\n\nT=8:560, 250 \u2192 250/30 is 8.333\u2026 Not integer.\n\nT=7:490, 320 \u2192 320/30=10.666\u2026 No.\n\nT=6:420, 390 \u2192 390/30=13. So that's possible. So T=6, S=13. But T=9 is higher than 6, so 9 is better.\n\nWait, but I thought T=9 was the maximum possible where the remaining is exactly divisible by 30. So the ratio when maximum T is bought would be 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But looking at the options, the options are all about the number of trousers, not the ratio. Wait, the question says, \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So perhaps the question is asking for the ratio, but the options are just the number of trousers, but wait the options are labeled with the number of trousers. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the options are A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. So perhaps the options are the number of trousers. But wait, the question says, \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So the answer would be the ratio, but the options are the number of trousers. That doesn't align. Wait, perhaps the options are the number of trousers, and the correct answer is 9. So in that case, the answer would be option A, 9.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me restate the problem.\n\nThe man spends 810 buying trousers and shirts. The price per trouser is 70, shirt is 30. Find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is bought.\n\nSo the maximum number of trousers is 9, as we found, because at T=9, the remaining 180 is exactly 6 shirts. So the ratio would be 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question is phrased as the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the ratio is 3:2, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the options are just the number of trousers. Because the question says, \"what will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" Wait, but the options are A)9 Trousers, etc. So maybe I'm misinterpreting. Wait, perhaps the options are giving the number of trousers, and the question is actually asking for the number of trousers. Because the way it's phrased is a bit confusing. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question is: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So the ratio is T:S. But the options are A)9 Trousers, etc., which suggests that the options are the number of trousers, not the ratio. That seems conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misread the question. Let me read it again.\n\n\"A man spends 810 in buying trouser at Rs 70 each and shirt at 30 each. What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\"\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers. So when he buys 9 trousers, he buys 6 shirts, so the ratio is 9:6 \u2192 3:2. But the options are not giving ratios, they're giving the number of trousers. So perhaps the question is actually asking for the number of trousers, but the way it's phrased is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are the number of shirts, but no, the options say \"9 Trousers\", etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are the possible number of trousers, and the correct answer is 9, so the answer is A. But I'm a bit confused because the question says \"ratio\", but the options are numbers. Maybe the question is phrased incorrectly, and it's actually asking for the number of trousers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me double-check.\n\nIf T=9, then cost is 70*9=630, remaining is 180. 180/30=6 shirts. So T=9, S=6. So the ratio is 9:6 \u2192 3:2.\n\nIf the question is asking for the ratio, the answer would be 3:2, but that's not in the options. So perhaps the options are the number of trousers, and the question is actually asking for that number.\n\nWait, perhaps the original question is phrased differently, like maybe \"What is the maximum number of trousers he can buy?\" which would be 9, option A. But the question as given says \"ratio of trouser and shirt\". So perhaps the options are incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio, but the options are presented as the number of trousers. That seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the equation.\n\nLet me write the equation again: 70T +30S=810.\n\nWe can factor out 10: 10*(7T +3S)=810 \u2192 7T +3S=81.\n\nWe're looking for integer solutions T and S such that 7T +3S=81, and T is as large as possible.\n\nWe can express this as 3S=81-7T \u2192 S=(81-7T)/3. For S to be integer, 81-7T must be divisible by 3.\n\n7T mod 3: since 7 mod3 is 1, so 7T mod3 is T mod3. So 81 mod3 is 0. So 81-7T mod3= (0 - T mod3) \u2192 so (81-7T) must be 0 mod3. So T must be 0 mod3. So T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo possible T values are 3,6,9,12. But 12*70=840 >810, so T can't be 12. So the maximum possible T is 9. \n\nSo T=9, S= (81-63)/3=18/3=6. So the ratio is 9:6 \u2192 3:2.\n\nBut again, the options don't present a ratio; they present the number of trousers. So perhaps the actual question is asking for the number of trousers, not the ratio. So the correct answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but the question says \"ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So perhaps the options are the number of trousers, and the correct answer is 9, so the answer is A.\n\nI think that's the case. So the correct option is A)9 Trousers.\n",

The total cost is given by:\n\\[\n70T + 30S = 810\n\\]\nWe aim to maximize \\( T \\) while ensuring \\( S \\) is an integer.\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the equation\nDivide the entire equation by 10:\n\\[\n7T + 3S = 81\n\\]\nRearranging for \\( S \\):\n\\[\nS = \\frac{81 - 7T}{3}\n\\]\nFor \\( S \\) to be an integer, \\( 81 - 7T \\) must be divisible by 3. Since \\( 7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\), \\( 7T \\equiv T \\pmod{3} \\). Thus, \\( 81 - 7T \\equiv 0 - T \\pmod{3} \\), meaning \\( T \\) must be a multiple of 3.\n\n### Step 3: Test possible values of \\( T \\)\nThe maximum possible \\( T \\) is determined by the budget constraint \\( 70T \\leq 810 \\). Dividing 810 by 70 gives approximately 11.57, so the maximum integer \\( T \\) is 11. Testing \\( T = 11 \\):\n\\[\n70 \\times 11 = 770, \\quad 810 - 770 = 40\n\\]\n\\[\nS = \\frac{40}{30} = \\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\nSince \\( S \\) is not an integer, \\( T = 11 \\) is not valid.\n\nNext, test \\( T = 10 \\):\n\\[\n70 \\times 10 = 700, \\quad 810 - 700 = 110\n\\]\n\\[\nS = \\frac{110}{30} = \\frac{11}{3}\n\\]\nAgain, \\( S \\) is not an integer, so \\( T = 10 \\) is invalid.\n\nNext, test \\( T = 9 \\):\n\\[\n70 \\times 9 = 630, \\quad 810 - 630 = 180\n\\]\n\\[\nS = \\frac{180}{30} = 6\n\\]\nHere, \\( S = 6 \\) is an integer, so \\( T = 9 \\) is valid.\n\n### Step 4: Verify higher values of \\( T \\)\nTesting \\( T = 8 \\):\n\\[\n70 \\times 8 = 560, \\quad 810 - 560 = 250\n\\]\n\\[\nS = \\frac{250}{30} = \\frac{25}{3}\n\\]\n\\( S \\) is not an integer, so \\( T = 8 \\) is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, lower values of \\( T \\) (e.g., \\( T = 7, 6, \\dots \\)) yield valid \\( S \\), but \\( T = 9 \\) is the maximum valid value.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the ratio\nWhen \\( T = 9 \\), \\( S = 6 \\). The ratio of trousers to shirts is:\n\\[\nT:S = 9:6 = 3:2\n\\]\nHowever, the question asks for the number of trousers when the maximum number is purchased. The correct answer is \\( T = 9 \\).\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe maximum number of trousers is **9**, corresponding to option **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully again. A man spends 810 rupees buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. I need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers possible. The options are A to E, each giving a number of trousers, which I think is the maximum number. So the question is, what's the maximum number of trousers he can buy without exceeding 810 rupees, and then find the ratio of trousers to shirts.\n\nHmm, so the main goal is to maximize the number of trousers. Each trouser is 70, each shirt is 30. The total amount he spends is 810.\n\nWait, but the problem says he buys some number of trousers and shirts. So let me denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S. The total cost would be 70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nWe need to maximize T, so we have to find the largest integer T such that 70*T is less than or equal to 810, and the remaining money can be spent on shirts, which are 30 each.\n\nSo, let me think. The maximum T would be when the remaining money is used to buy shirts. So, 70*T \u2264 810. Let's compute 810 divided by 70.\n\nCalculating 810 /70. 70*11 is 770. 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So the maximum T possible without exceeding 810 is 11, but wait, 70*11 is 770, which leaves 810-770=40. But each shirt is 30. 40 divided by 30 is 1.333, which is not an integer. So he can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So, the remaining 40 can't be used to buy another shirt. So that's a problem. So, 11 trousers would leave 40, which can't buy a shirt. So that's not allowed, because he must buy some shirts, or maybe not? Wait, the problem doesn't specify that he buys at least one shirt. Oh, wait, the question is about the ratio when he buys the maximum number of trousers. So perhaps he buys some shirts, but maybe zero shirts? But that would mean the ratio is undefined, which is not possible. So perhaps he must buy at least one shirt.\n\nWait, the problem states that he buys both trousers and shirts. Because the options are all about the number of trousers, but the problem says 'the maximum number of trouser is purchased.' So maybe he buys as many trousers as possible, and then with the remaining money, he buys shirts. If the remaining money can't buy a shirt, then he can't have that number of trousers.\n\nWait, that's the case. So, let's go back. Let me try T=11: 11*70=770. Remaining is 40, which can't buy a shirt. So that's not possible. So T=11 is invalid because he can't spend exactly 810. So he needs to spend all the money, or perhaps the problem allows for partial spending? Wait, no, he spends 810 in total.\n\nSo perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The maximum number of trousers he can buy is such that the remaining amount is divisible by 30, so that the shirts can be bought without any leftover money.\n\nSo, the approach is to find the largest T where (810 -70*T) is divisible by 30.\n\nSo, 810 -70*T must be divisible by 30. Let me write that as (810 -70T) mod 30 == 0.\n\nHmm, let's compute 70 mod 30. 70 divided by 30 is 2 with remainder 10. So 70 \u226110 mod 30.\n\nSo 70*T \u226110*T mod 30. So 810 mod 30: 810 divided by 30 is 27, so 810 \u22610 mod 30.\n\nSo, 0 - (10*T) \u22610 mod30 \u2192 -10T \u22610 mod30 \u2192 10T \u22610 mod30 \u2192 10T must be a multiple of 30. So T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nBecause 10T =30k \u2192 T=3k, where k is integer.\n\nSo T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo, we need to find the maximum T (multiple of 3) such that 70*T \u2264810.\n\nLet me compute the maximum T possible regardless of the condition. 810/70 is approx 11.57. So the integer part is 11. But since T must be a multiple of 3, the largest T possible is 9, because 9 is less than 11.57, and 9 is a multiple of 3 (3*3=9). Let me check 9*70=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6 shirts. So that works. So 9 trousers and 6 shirts. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question is about the ratio of trouser to shirt when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So the maximum T is 9, which would make the ratio 9:6, which is 3:2, but the options are the number of trousers, not the ratio. Wait, the options are A)9, B)8, etc. So the correct option is A)9.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check higher multiples of 3. Wait, 12 is a multiple of 3, but 12*70=840>810. So 12 is too big. So the next lower multiple is 9.\n\nWait, but what about 70*9=630. 810-630=180, which is 6 shirts. So that's correct.\n\nSo the maximum number of trousers is 9. So the ratio is 9:6, which reduces to 3:2, but the options only give the number of trousers, so the answer is 9, option A.\n\nWait, but wait another possibility: perhaps the man can buy other numbers of trousers that are not multiples of 3, but in such a way that the remaining money is a multiple of 30. For example, T=10: 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3 with a remainder of 20. So no, that's not divisible. So T=10 can't be.\n\nWhat about T=8? 70*8=560. 810-560=250. 250/30 is 8.333, which isn't integer. So no. T=7:70*7=490. 810-490=320. 320/30 is 10.666, no. So no. T=6:70*6=420. 810-420=390. 390/30=13. So that works, but 6 is less than 9, so 9 is better.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9, so option A is correct.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where a man spends 810 rupees buying trousers and shirts. Trousers cost 70 each and shirts are 30 each. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers possible. The options are given as A to E, each with a number of trousers.\n\nHmm, wait. So he wants to maximize the number of trousers he buys without exceeding 810 rupees. That makes sense. So I need to find how many trousers he can buy with 810, and then see how many shirts he can buy with the remaining money, right?\n\nWait, no. Wait, he's buying both, but he's trying to get as many trousers as possible. So I think the approach is to buy as many trousers as possible, and then with the leftover money, buy shirts. But the problem is about the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number is purchased. So maybe the ratio depends on how many shirts he can buy with the remaining money after buying the maximum possible trousers.\n\nBut wait, the options are the number of trousers, not the ratio. Oh wait, the options are the number of trousers, but the question is about the ratio. Wait, no, wait. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question is: What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased? Oh, wait, so the ratio is the number of trousers to the number of shirts. So, after finding the maximum number of trousers he can buy, we have to find how many shirts he can buy with the remaining money, then calculate the ratio.\n\nWait, but the problem states that he spends 810 in buying both. So the total cost is 70*T + 30*S = 810, where T is the number of trousers and S is the number of shirts. We need to maximize T, then find S, and then find the ratio T:S.\n\nSo the approach is to find the maximum integer T such that 70*T \u2264 810. Because if T is as large as possible without exceeding the total, then the remaining money can be used for shirts.\n\nSo first, let's calculate the maximum possible T. Let's divide 810 by 70.\n\n810 divided by 70. Let's see: 70 * 11 is 770. 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So the maximum T is 11, but wait, 70*11 is 770, which is within 810. Then the remaining money is 810-770=40. Now, shirts are 30 each. So with 40, can he buy any shirts? 30*1=30, which is within 40. So he can buy 1 shirt, using 30, leaving 10 which is not enough for another shirt. So S=1.\n\nWait, but let me check: 70*T + 30*S = 810. We need T as maximum possible. So if T=11, then 770, and 40 left. 40/30 is 1.333... So he can buy 1 shirt, and have 10 left. So S=1.\n\nWait, but 40 isn't enough for another shirt. So the ratio would be T:S = 11:1. But looking at the options, option E is 11 Trousers. So maybe the ratio is 11:1, but the options only give the number of trousers. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, the question is phrased a bit confusingly. Let me read it again: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" Oh wait, perhaps the ratio is T:S, and the options give possible numbers of T, but the correct option would have the ratio corresponding to the maximum T.\n\nWait, but the options are A)9 Trousers, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11. So the correct answer is E) 11 Trousers, but the ratio would be 11:1, which isn't given as an option, but the question is asking for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is bought, and the options are the number of trousers. So perhaps the correct option is E, which allows for the maximum number of trousers.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach this step by step.\n\nThe total amount is 810. Let T be the number of trousers, each 70, and S the number of shirts, each 30. So:\n\n70T + 30S = 810.\n\nWe need to maximize T. So T can be as large as possible where 70T \u2264810.\n\n70*11=770, which is less than 810. 70*12=840, which is more than 810. So maximum T is 11.\n\nSo 70*11=770. Remaining money is 810-770=40.\n\n40 can buy 1 shirt (30) and have 10 left, which isn't enough for another. So S=1.\n\nSo the ratio of T:S is 11:1. But looking at the options, the answer is E)11 Trousers. So perhaps the question is just asking for the maximum number of trousers, which is 11, so E is correct.\n\nWait, but the question says, what is the ratio of trouser to shirt when maximum number of trouser is purchased? So the answer would be 11:1, but that's not one of the options. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is to be expressed as a whole number, but the options only give the number of trousers. Oh, but the options are A)9 Trousers, which would imply that the ratio is 9:S, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the question is just asking for the maximum number of trousers, and the ratio is a distractor.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think again.\n\nThe question is asking for the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So the maximum number of trousers is 11, which uses 770, leaving 40 for shirts. 40/30 is 1 shirt, so 11:1.\n\nBut the options are all the number of trousers, so perhaps the correct answer is E, which is 11, but that's just the number of trousers, not the ratio. So perhaps the options are miswritten, but given that, the correct answer would be E.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about maximizing the number of items, not the number of trousers. Wait, but the question says 'maximum number of trouser' is purchased, so that's clear.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the ratio is to be in the form of T:S, so the ratio is 11:1, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, let's recalculate the maximum T.\n\n70*T \u2264 810 \u2192 T \u2264 810/70 \u2192 810 divided by 70 is 11.571, so T can be 11, as 11.571 is not an integer.\n\nSo 11 is correct.\n\nBut wait, what if after buying 11 trousers, the remaining money is 40. 40 is not enough to buy another shirt, so S=1. So the ratio is 11:1.\n\nBut the options don't have 11:1. So perhaps the question is actually about the maximum number of items, not the maximum number of trousers.\n\nWait, that's possible. If the question is to maximize the total number of items bought (trousers + shirts), then the approach changes. But the question says 'the maximum number of trouser is purchased', so that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio is to be expressed as the number of trousers to the number of shirts. So for each option, we can compute T and S, then find the ratio.\n\nWait, let's check each option.\n\nOption A: 9 Trousers. So 9*70=630. Remaining money: 810-630=180. Number of shirts: 180/30=6. So ratio is 9:6 \u2192 simplifies to 3:2.\n\nOption B: 8 Trousers. 8*70=560. 810-560=250. 250/30=8.333. So 8 shirts. 250-240=10 left. So ratio 8:8 \u2192 1:1.\n\nOption C: 10 Trousers. 10*70=700. Remaining 110. 110/30=3.666, so 3 shirts. So ratio 10:3.\n\nOption D:7 Trousers. 7*70=490. 810-490=320. 320/30=10.666. So 10 shirts. 320-300=20 left. Ratio 7:10.\n\nOption E:11 Trousers. 11*70=770. Remaining 40. 40/30=1.333. So 1 shirt. Ratio 11:1.\n\nThe question is asking for the ratio when maximum number of trousers is bought. So the maximum T is 11, giving a ratio of 11:1. But in the options, E is 11 Trousers. So the ratio is 11:1, but the options don't present it. So perhaps the question is not about the ratio but the number of trousers.

Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the maximum number of trousers. Let me check again.\n\nMaximum T is 11, which gives S=1. So the ratio is 11:1. But that's not one of the options.

Let me try a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the man buys both, but in such a way that the ratio is achieved. So maybe the ratio is given, and the question is to find the number of trousers when that ratio holds, but that's not the case here.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the total number of items (T + S) is maximum. So to maximize the number of items, the man buys more cheaper items. But the question says he buys maximum number of trousers, which are more expensive, so that's not the case.\n\nHmm. So back to the initial approach. The maximum number of trousers is 11, with 1 shirt. The ratio is 11:1, but the options don't include that ratio. So perhaps the answer is E)11 Trousers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the ratio in terms of the number of items, but I'm not sure.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where a man spends 810 rupees buying trousers and shirts. Trousers cost 70 each and shirts are 30 each. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers possible. The options are given as A to E, each with a number of trousers.\n\nHmm, wait. So he wants to maximize the number of trousers he buys without exceeding 810 rupees. That makes sense. So I need to find how many trousers he can buy with 810, and then see how many shirts he can buy with the remaining money, right?\n\nWait, no. Wait, he's buying both, but he's trying to get as many trousers as possible. So I think the approach is to buy as many trousers as possible, and then with the leftover money, buy shirts. But the problem is about the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number is purchased. So maybe the ratio depends on how many shirts he can buy with the remaining money after buying the maximum possible trousers.\n\nBut wait, the options are the number of trousers, not the ratio. Oh wait, the options are the number of trousers, but the question is about the ratio. Wait, no, wait. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question is: What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased? Oh, wait, so the ratio is the number of trousers to the number of shirts. So, after finding the maximum number of trousers he can buy, we have to find how many shirts he can buy with the remaining money, then calculate the ratio.\n\nWait, but the problem states that he spends 810 in buying both. So the total cost is 70*T + 30*S = 810, where T is the number of trousers and S is the number of shirts. We need to maximize T, then find S, and then find the ratio T:S.\n\nSo the approach is to find the maximum integer T such that 70*T \u2264 810. Because if T is as large as possible without exceeding the total, then the remaining money can be used for shirts.\n\nSo first, let's calculate the maximum possible T. Let's divide 810 by 70.\n\n810 divided by 70. Let's see: 70 * 11 is 770. 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So the maximum T is 11, but wait, 70*11 is 770, which is within 810. Then the remaining money is 810-770=40. Now, shirts are 30 each. So with 40, can he buy any shirts? 30*1=30, which is within 40. So he can buy 1 shirt, using 30, leaving 10 which is not enough for another shirt. So S=1.\n\nWait, but let me check: 70*T + 30*S = 810. We need T as maximum possible. So if T=11, then 770, and 40 left. 40/30 is 1.333... So he can buy 1 shirt, and have 10 left. So S=1.\n\nWait, but 40 isn't enough for another shirt. So the ratio would be T:S = 11:1. But looking at the options, option E is 11 Trousers. So maybe the ratio is 11:1, but the options only give the number of trousers. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, the question is phrased a bit confusingly. Let me read it again: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" Oh wait, perhaps the ratio is T:S, and the options give possible numbers of T, but the correct option would have the ratio corresponding to the maximum T.\n\nWait, but the options are A)9 Trousers, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11. So the correct answer is E) 11 Trousers, but the ratio would be 11:1, which isn't given as an option, but the question is asking for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is bought, and the options are the number of trousers. So perhaps the correct option is E, which allows for the maximum number of trousers.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach this step by step.\n\nThe total amount is 810. Let T be the number of trousers, each 70, and S the number of shirts, each 30. So:\n\n70T + 30S = 810.\n\nWe need to maximize T. So T can be as large as possible where 70T \u2264810.\n\n70*11=770, which is less than 810. 70*12=840, which is more than 810. So maximum T is 11.\n\nSo 70*11=770. Remaining money is 810-770=40.\n\n40 can buy 1 shirt (30) and have 10 left, which isn't enough for another. So S=1.\n\nSo the ratio of T:S is 11:1. But looking at the options, the answer is E)11 Trousers. So perhaps the question is just asking for the maximum number of trousers, which is 11, so E is correct.\n\nWait, but the question says, what is the ratio of trouser to shirt when maximum number of trouser is purchased? So the answer would be 11:1, but that's not one of the options. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is to be expressed as a whole number, but the options only give the number of trousers. Oh, but the options are A)9 Trousers, which would imply that the ratio is 9:S, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the question is just asking for the maximum number of trousers, and the ratio is a distractor.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think again.\n\nThe question is asking for the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So the maximum number of trousers is 11, which uses 770, leaving 40 for shirts. 40/30 is 1 shirt, so 11:1.\n\nBut the options are all the number of trousers, so perhaps the correct answer is E, which is 11, but that's just the number of trousers, not the ratio.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question says that a man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. The trousers cost 70 rupees each, and shirts are 30 rupees each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers possible. The options are given as A to E, each with a certain number of trousers.\n\nHmm, I think this is a problem involving maximizing the number of trousers he can buy within the total amount. So the goal is to buy as many trousers as possible, and then see how many shirts that leaves him with, and then find the ratio.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. The total cost is 70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible integer value of T such that 70*T is less than or equal to 810, and then see what S would be.\n\nWait, but since both T and S have to be whole numbers, we can't have fractions of a shirt or trouser. So we need to find the maximum T where 70*T is less than or equal to 810, and then see if the remaining money can be spent on shirts.\n\nLet me calculate the maximum possible T. So 810 divided by 70 is... let me compute that. 70*11 is 770, which is 770. 70*12 is 840, which is over 810. So 11 is too much. So the maximum T possible is 11-1=10? Wait, no, wait. Let me compute 70*11=770. 770 is less than 810. Then 70*12 is 840 which is more than 810. So the maximum T is 11, but wait, 70*11 is 770, which leaves 810-770=40 rupees. But shirts are 30 each. So with 40, he can buy 1 shirt (30) and have 10 left, but 10 isn't enough for another shirt. So the total shirts would be 1.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the maximum number of trousers. So maybe 11 is possible if the remaining money can cover the shirts, but wait, he can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So let's check: 70*T +30*S =810.\n\nLet me think of T as the maximum possible. So if T is 11, then 70*11=770. 810-770=40. So 40 must be equal to 30*S. So 30*S=40 \u2192 S=40/30=4/3 \u22481.333. But S has to be an integer. So S can't be 1.333, so that's not possible. So T=11 isn't possible because it would require buying a fraction of a shirt.\n\nSo the next possible T is 10. Let's check T=10: 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666... So S=3 would leave 110-90=20. That's not enough for another shirt. So S=3, total cost is 700+90=790, which leaves 20 unspent. But maybe that's acceptable because we can't buy a fraction.\n\nWait, but the question says he spends 810, so all the money must be spent. So in that case, T=10 and S= (810-700)/30 = 110/30 = 11/3 \u22483.666. That's not an integer. So that's not possible either.\n\nHmm, so maybe T=9. Let's calculate. 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180 divided by 30 is 6. So S=6. So that works because 630 + 6*30 = 630+180=810. Exactly. So T=9 and S=6.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought T=11, it didn't work because S wasn't an integer. So the next step is to try T=11, which is not possible, then T=10, which is also not possible because 110 isn't divisible by 30. So T=9 is the maximum possible that allows S to be an integer. Because with T=9, S=6, which is an integer.\n\nSo the ratio of T:S is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But wait, the question is about the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So in this case, the maximum T possible is 9, with 6 shirts. So the ratio is 9:6.\n\nLooking at the options, the options are A)9, B)8, etc. But the question asks for the ratio of trousers to shirts, not just the number of trousers. Wait, no, the options are labeled as 'Trousers' followed by a number, but I think the options are just giving the number of trousers, and the question is about the ratio. Wait, the question says, \"what will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So the ratio is T:S, which would be 9:6 or 3:2.\n\nBut the options are labeled as A)9 Trousers, etc., which suggests the options are giving the number of trousers, not the ratio. So perhaps the options are giving the possible maximum number of trousers, and the correct answer would be the maximum T possible. So in our case, the maximum T possible is 9. So the answer would be option A, 9 Trousers.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because when T=9, S=6, which adds up correctly. But earlier I thought T=10 might be possible but it's not because S becomes a fraction. So the maximum T possible is 9.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Let's try T=11: 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40/30=1.333, which isn't an integer. So no, can't buy 11 trousers.\n\nT=10: 700. 810-700=110. 110/30=3.666, which isn't an integer.\n\nT=9: 630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. So that's good.\n\nT=8: 70*8=560. 810-560=250. 250/30=8.333, which isn't integer.\n\nSo the next possible T is 9, which is the maximum possible.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6, which can be simplified to 3:2.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question says that a man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. The trousers cost 70 rupees each, and shirts are 30 rupees each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers possible. The options are given as A to E, each with a certain number of trousers.\n\nHmm, I think this is a problem involving maximizing the number of trousers he can buy within the total amount. So the goal is to buy as many trousers as possible, and then see how many shirts that leaves him with, and then find the ratio.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. The total cost is 70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible integer value of T such that 70*T is less than or equal to 810, and then see what S would be.\n\nWait, but since both T and S have to be whole numbers, we can't have fractions of a shirt or trouser. So we need to find the maximum T where 70*T is less than or equal to 810, and then see if the remaining money can be spent on shirts.\n\nLet me calculate the maximum possible T. So 810 divided by 70 is... let me compute that. 70*11 is 770, which is 770. 70*12 is 840, which is over 810. So 11 is too much. So the maximum T possible is 11-1=10? Wait, no, wait. Let me compute 70*11=770. 770 is less than 810. Then 70*12 is 840 which is more than 810. So the maximum T is 11, but wait, 70*11 is 770, which leaves 810-770=40 rupees. But shirts are 30 each. So with 40, he can buy 1 shirt (30) and have 10 left, but 10 isn't enough for another shirt. So the total shirts would be 1.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the maximum number of trousers. So maybe 11 is possible if the remaining money can cover the shirts, but wait, he can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So let's check: 70*T +30*S =810.\n\nLet me think of T as the maximum possible. So if T is 11, then 70*11=770. 810-770=40. So 40 must be equal to 30*S. So 30*S=40 \u2192 S=40/30=4/3 \u22481.333. But S has to be an integer. So S can't be 1.333, so that's not possible. So T=11 isn't possible because it would require buying a fraction of a shirt.\n\nSo the next possible T is 10. Let's check T=10: 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666... So S=3 would leave 110-90=20. That's not enough for another shirt. So S=3, total cost is 700+90=790, which leaves 20 unspent. But maybe that's acceptable because we can't buy a fraction.\n\nWait, but the question says he spends 810, so all the money must be spent. So in that case, T=10 and S= (810-700)/30 = 110/30 = 11/3 \u22483.666. That's not an integer. So that's not possible either.\n\nHmm, so maybe T=9. Let's calculate. 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180 divided by 30 is 6. So S=6. So that works because 630 + 6*30 = 630+180=810. Exactly. So T=9 and S=6.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought T=11, it didn't work because S wasn't an integer. So the next step is to try T=11, which is not possible, then T=10, which is also not possible because 110 isn't divisible by 30. So T=9 is the maximum possible that allows S to be an integer. Because with T=9, S=6, which is an integer.\n\nSo the ratio of T:S is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But wait, the question is about the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So in this case, the maximum T possible is 9, with 6 shirts. So the ratio is 9:6.\n\nLooking at the options, the options are A)9, B)8, etc. But the question asks for the ratio of trousers to shirts, not just the number of trousers. Wait, no, the options are labeled as 'Trousers' followed by a number, but I think the options are just giving the number of trousers, and the question is about the ratio. Wait, the question says, \"what will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So the ratio is T:S, which would be 9:6 or 3:2.\n\nBut the options are labeled as A)9 Trousers, etc., which suggests the options are giving the number of trousers, not the ratio. So perhaps the options are giving the possible maximum number of trousers, and the correct answer would be the maximum T possible. So in our case, the maximum T possible is 9. So the answer would be option A, 9 Trousers.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because when T=9, S=6, which adds up correctly. But earlier I thought T=10 might be possible but it's not because S becomes a fraction. So the maximum T possible is 9.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Let's try T=11: 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40/30=1.333, which isn't an integer. So no, can't buy 11 trousers.\n\nT=10: 700. 810-700=110. 110/30=3.666, which isn't an integer.\n\nT=9: 630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. So that's good.\n\nT=8: 70*8=560. 810-560=250. 250/30=8.333, which isn't integer.\n\nSo the next possible T is 9, which is the maximum possible.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6, which can be simplified to 3:2. But the options are giving the number of trousers, so the maximum number is 9.

We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers possible. The options are A to E, each giving a number of trousers.\n\nHmm, right. So the main goal is to maximize the number of trousers he can buy without exceeding 810 rupees. Once we find that maximum number, we can figure out how many shirts he bought alongside, and then determine the ratio.\n\nLet me think about the approach. I think this is a linear equation problem. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S. The total cost would be 70T + 30S = 810.\n\nWe want to maximize T, which means we need to find the largest possible integer T such that when multiplied by 70, the remaining money can buy some number of shirts, which should also be an integer.\n\nSo the equation is 70T + 30S = 810. Let's rearrange it to solve for S.\n\n30S = 810 -70T\nS = (810 -70T)/30\n\nSince S must be an integer, the numerator (810 -70T) must be divisible by 30. Let's see what that implies.\n\nWait, 70 can be written as 70 = 10*7, and 30 is 10*3. So perhaps we can factor out 10?\n\nLet me write it again. 70T +30S=810. Divide both sides by 10: 7T +3S =81.\n\nNow the equation is 7T +3S =81. We need both T and S to be integers, and T should be as large as possible.\n\nSo 7T =81 -3S. Since 7T must be a non-negative integer, 81-3S must be non-negative and divisible by 7.\n\nWait, 81-3S must be divisible by 7. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of 7T =81 -3S \u2192 7T =3*(27 -S). So 7 must divide 3*(27 - S). Since 7 is prime and doesn't divide 3, it must divide (27 - S). So (27 - S) must be a multiple of 7.\n\nSo 27 - S = 7k, where k is an integer. Then S=27 -7k.\n\nBut S can't be negative, so 27 -7k \u22650 \u2192 7k \u226427 \u2192 k \u226427/7 \u22483.857. So k can be 0,1,2,3.\n\nBut since T is to be maximized, let's find the largest possible T. Let's express T in terms of k.\n\nFrom 7T =3*(27 -S) \u2192 7T=3*(7k) \u2192 7T=21k \u2192 T=3k.\n\nSo T=3k. Since k can be 0,1,2,3, let's see what T is for each possible k.\n\nk=3: T=9. S=27-7*3=27-21=6. That works because 70*9=630, 30*6=180; 630+180=810. Yes, that adds up.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's check for k=3: T=9, S=6. So 9*70=630, 6*30=180. 630+180=810. Perfect.\n\nBut wait, could k be higher? No, because when k=4, S=27-28= -1, which is invalid. So the maximum possible k is 3, giving T=9.\n\nSo the maximum number of trousers is 9, and shirts are 6. So the ratio is T:S =9:6. Which simplifies to 3:2. But the question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when maximum number of trousers is bought.\n\nWait, the options are given as the number of trousers. The question is, what is the ratio when maximum number is bought. Wait, but the options are the number of trousers. So the maximum number of trousers is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking back, the options are labeled A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. So the correct answer is A)9 Trousers. So the ratio is 9:6 or 3:2, but the question isn't directly asking for the ratio but the number of trousers when the ratio is achieved. Wait, no, the question says, 'what will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?'\n\nWait, wait, the question wording is a bit confusing. Let me read it again. \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So the ratio is T:S. And the options are giving the number of trousers, but perhaps the ratio is one of the options, but looking at the options, they don't list ratios. Oh wait, the options are only the number of trousers. So perhaps the question is actually asking for the number of trousers, not the ratio.\n\nWait, wait, the original question says: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So the ratio is T:S. But the options are numbers of trousers, which is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are in terms of the number of trousers, but the question is about the ratio. So I'm a bit confused. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says the man spends 810 on trousers and shirts. He buys as many trousers as possible. What is the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts in this case.\n\nSo, when he buys maximum T, the ratio is T:S.\n\nFrom earlier, T=9, S=6. So the ratio is 9:6 \u2192 simplifies to 3:2. But looking at the options, the options are only numbers, not ratios. So perhaps the question is actually asking for the number of trousers, which is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but the question says, 'the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.' So the answer should be the ratio, like 3:2, but the options are numbers. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, maybe the options are not about the ratio but the number of trousers. Let me read the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA)9 Trousers\nB)8 Trousers\nC)10 Trousers\nD)7 Trousers\nE)11 Trousers\n\nSo the options are possible numbers of trousers. So the question is, which number of trousers is possible when he buys the maximum number, and the ratio is T:S.

The problem says: What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased? Oh, the ratio is T:S. But the options are all numbers, so perhaps the options are the number of trousers, and the correct one is 9.\n\nWait, but the options are given as A)9 Trousers, etc. So the question is, when he buys the maximum number of trousers, what is that number? So the answer is 9, option A.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if he buys 9 trousers, then the rest of the money goes to shirts. So 9*70=630, 810-630=180. 180/30=6 shirts. So the ratio is 9:6 \u2192 3:2. But the question is about the ratio, but the options don't list ratios. So perhaps the options are the number of trousers. So the correct option is A)9 Trousers.\n\nWait, but why is the question phrased as asking for the ratio? Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the question is a bit ambiguous, but the intended answer is the number of trousers, which is 9, so the answer is A.\n",

So the question is, which number of trousers is possible when he buys the maximum number, and the ratio is T:S. So the answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but why is the question phrased as 'what is the ratio when the maximum number is purchased'? Because the ratio would then be 9:6, which is 3:2. But the options are about the number of trousers, not the ratio. So perhaps the question is just asking for the number of trousers, not the ratio. Maybe I misread the question.\n\nLet me check again. The problem says: What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased? Oh, the ratio is T:S. But the options are all numbers, so perhaps the options are the number of trousers, and the correct one is 9.\n\nWait, but the options are given as A)9 Trousers, etc. So the question is, when he buys the maximum number of trousers, what is that number? So the answer is 9, option A.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if he buys 9 trousers, then the rest of the money goes to shirts. So 9*70=630, 810-630=180. 180/30=6 shirts. So the ratio is 9:6 \u2192 3:2. But the question is about the ratio, but the options don't list ratios. So perhaps the options are the number of trousers. So the correct option is A)9 Trousers.\n\nWait, but why is the question phrased as asking for the ratio? Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the question is a bit ambiguous, but the intended answer is the number of trousers, which is 9, so the answer is A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of trousers a man can purchase with 810 rupees, given that each trouser costs 70 rupees and each shirt costs 30 rupees. The total expenditure is represented by the equation:\n\n\\[\n70T + 30S = 810\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(T\\) is the number of trousers and \\(S\\) is the number of shirts. To maximize \\(T\\), we rearrange the equation:\n\n\\[\n30S = 810 - 70T \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad S = \\frac{810 - 70T}{30}\n\\]\n\nFor \\(S\\) to be an integer, the numerator \\(810 - 70T\\) must be divisible by 30. Simplifying the equation by dividing through by 10 gives:\n\n\\[\n7T + 3S = 81\n\\]\n\nRearranging for \\(S\\):\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{81 - 7T}{3}\n\\]\n\nFor \\(S\\) to be an integer, \\(81 - 7T\\) must be divisible by 3. Additionally, \\(T\\) must be as large as possible while ensuring \\(S \\geq 0\\). Testing possible values of \\(T\\), we find:\n\n- For \\(T = 9\\): \\(S = \\frac{81 - 7(9)}{3} = \\frac{81 - 63}{3} = \\frac{18}{3} = 6\\). This satisfies the conditions, as \\(S\\) is a non-negative integer.\n\nTesting higher values of \\(T\\) (e.g., \\(T = 10\\)) results in negative values for \\(S\\), which are invalid. Thus, the maximum number of trousers is \\(T = 9\\), with \\(S = 6\\). The ratio of trousers to shirts is therefore \\(9:6\\), which simplifies to \\(3:2\\). However, the question asks for the number of trousers when the maximum number is purchased, which is \\(9\\).\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: A**",

The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are given as A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11. Hmm, wait, the options are the number of trousers, but I think the question is more about finding the ratio, not just the number.\n\nWait, let me read the question again. It says, \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So the ratio is the number of trousers to shirts. So I need to find the maximum number of trousers he can buy without exceeding 810 rupees, and then see how many shirts he can buy with the remaining money, and then compute the ratio.\n\nSo the plan is: find the maximum number of trousers (let's call it T) such that 70*T is less than or equal to 810. Then, the remaining money is 810 -70*T, which will be used to buy shirts at 30 each. The number of shirts S will be (810-70*T)/30. But S must be an integer, right? Because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt.\n\nSo I need to find the largest T where 70*T \u2264 810, and (810-70*T) must be divisible by 30 because otherwise, you can't have a whole number of shirts. Hmm, so maybe I should approach this step by step.\n\nLet me calculate how much money is spent on trousers and shirts. The total amount is 810.\n\nSo, 70*T +30*S =810.\n\nI can simplify this equation. Let's divide everything by 10 to make it easier.\n\n7*T +3*S =81.\n\nSo, 7T +3S =81.\n\nWe need to find integer values T and S such that this equation holds, and T is as large as possible.\n\nSo, I can think of this as solving for S in terms of T: 3S =81-7T \u2192 S=(81-7T)/3.\n\nFor S to be an integer, 81-7T must be divisible by 3.\n\nWait, 7T mod 3 is equal to (7 mod 3)*T mod 3. 7 mod3 is 1, so 7T mod3 = T mod3.\n\nSo 81 is divisible by 3 (since 81/3=27), so 81 mod3 is 0. So 81-7T must be 0 mod3 \u2192 0 - (T mod3) =0 mod3 \u2192 T mod3=0. So T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo T can be 0,3,6,9,12,... but we need the maximum T such that 70*T \u2264810.\n\nWait, 70*T \u2264810 \u2192 T \u2264810/70 \u2192 810 divided by 70 is approximately 11.57. So T can be up to 11, but it must be a multiple of 3. Let's list possible T values.\n\nPossible T: 9, 12 is beyond 11, so the maximum T is 9.\n\nWait, let's check T=9: 70*9=630. Remaining money is 810-630=180. 180/30=6 shirts. So S=6. So ratio T:S is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but what about T=12? Wait, 70*12=840, which is more than 810, so T can't be 12.\n\nBut wait, are there any other T values higher than 9 but less than or equal to 11 that are multiples of 3? The next one after 9 is 12, which is too big. So the maximum T is 9.\n\nWait, but let's confirm. Let's test T=9 and T=10,11 to see if any higher T (but not necessarily multiples of 3) might work.\n\nWait, T=10: 70*10=700. Remaining is 110. 110/30=3.666... shirts. That's not an integer, so S isn't an integer. So this isn't acceptable.\n\nT=11: 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40/30=1.333... shirts. Not an integer. So S=1.333, which isn't allowed.\n\nSo the next possible T is 9, which gives S=6. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So the options give the number of trousers, so the maximum number is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check T=8. 70*8=560. Remaining is 250. 250/30=8.333... shirts. Not an integer. So S=8.333, which is not allowed.\n\nT=7: 70*7=490. Remaining 320. 320/30=10.666... shirts. Not integer.\n\nT=6: 420. Remaining 390. 390/30=13. So S=13. So T=6, S=13. Ratio 6:13.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is about a man who spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. Trousers cost 70 each and shirts cost 30 each. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased.\n\nHmm, I think the first thing I should do is understand what's being asked. The key here is that the man wants to buy as many trousers as possible. So, I guess I need to maximize the number of trousers while staying within the 810 rupees budget.\n\nLet me think about how to set this up. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. The total cost equation would then be 70*T + 30*S = 810. Right?\n\nSince the goal is to maximize T, I need to find the largest possible integer value for T such that 70*T is less than or equal to 810, and then see what S would be. But wait, the problem mentions a ratio, so maybe I need to find the number of shirts that allows T to be as large as possible without exceeding the budget.\n\nLet me approach this systematically. Let's find the maximum T possible. The maximum number of trousers would be when the remaining money is used to buy shirts. So, first, find how many trousers can be bought with 810 rupees.\n\nSo, T_max = 810 // 70. Let me calculate that. 70 times 11 is 770, which is under 810. 70 times 12 is 840, which is over. So T_max is 11, but wait, 11*70 is 770, leaving 810-770=40. But shirts cost 30 each. 40 divided by 30 is 1.333, which isn't an integer. So that's a problem because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So T=11 isn't possible because 40 isn't enough to buy another shirt, and the man is probably buying some shirts as well.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem allows for buying zero shirts. Wait, the question says he buys both, I think. Let me check the original question again. Oh, no, it just says he spends 810 on buying trousers and shirts. So he could buy zero shirts if needed. But in that case, the maximum T would be 810/70 = 11.57. So maximum integer T is 11. But then the remaining money is 40, which isn't enough for another shirt. So if he buys 11 trousers, that's 770, and the remaining 40 can't buy any shirts because each shirt is 30, but 40 >=30? Wait, 40 is more than 30. Wait, 40 can buy one shirt for 30, leaving 10. But 10 isn't enough for another shirt. So if he buys 11 trousers, he can buy 1 shirt, and have 10 left, which isn't enough. So that's possible.\n\nWait, but wait, 70*11 = 770. 30*1=30. Total is 800. 810-800=10. So that's correct. So the total is 800, but he has 10 rupees left. But the question says he spends 810, so maybe he can't have any leftover money. Oh, because he spends exactly 810. So he can't have 10 left. So 11 trousers and 1 shirt only sum to 800. So that's not 810. So that won't work. So that means T can't be 11, because that would leave him with 10 rupees, which isn't allowed.\n\nHmm, so maybe the maximum number of T that allows the total to be exactly 810. Let me think again. So, 70T +30S =810. Let's simplify this equation. I can divide both sides by 10 to make it easier: 7T +3S =81.\n\nNow, we're looking for integer solutions where T is as large as possible. Let's express S in terms of T: 3S=81-7T \u2192 S=(81-7T)/3. S has to be an integer \u22650.\n\nSo, 81-7T must be divisible by 3 and non-negative. So let's find T such that 81-7T \u22650 and (81-7T) mod 3 =0.\n\nSince 81 mod 3 is 0 (because 8+1=9, which is divisible by 3), and 7 mod 3 is 1. So 7T mod3 is (7 mod3)*T mod3 \u2192 1*T mod3. So 81-7T mod3 = 0 - T mod3. Which must be 0. So T mod3 must be 0. So T has to be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo T can be 0,3,6,9, etc., but we want the maximum possible T. Let's find the maximum T where 7T \u226481.\n\n7T \u226481 \u2192 T \u2264 81/7 \u224811.57. So maximum possible T is 11, but as we saw earlier, 11 is not a multiple of 3. Next lower multiple is 9.\n\nLet's check T=9.\n\n7*9=63. 81-63=18. 18/3=6. So S=6. So total cost is 9*70 +6*30 =630 +180=810. Perfect.\n\nSo the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6. Which simplifies to 3:2. But the question isn't asking for the ratio's simplified form; it's asking for the number of trousers when maximum is bought. So the maximum number is 9, so the ratio would be 9 trousers to 6 shirts. But looking at the options, the options are about the number of trousers. The options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought T=11 is possible, but then realized that the total would be 800, which leaves 10 unspent. So that's not allowed because he must spend exactly 810. So the next possible T is 9.\n\nWait, but let me check T=10. Because 10 is not a multiple of 3. So T=10, let's see if it works. Let's plug into 7T +3S =81.\n\n7*10=70. 81-70=11. 11/3 is not an integer. So S would be 3.666..., which isn't allowed. So T=10 is invalid.\n\nWhat about T=8? Let's check. 7*8=56. 81-56=25. 25/3 is about 8.333, which isn't an integer. So no.\n\nT=7: 7*7=49. 81-49=32. 32/3 \u224810.666. No.\n\nT=6: 7*6=42. 81-42=39. 39/3=13. So S=13. That's valid. So total cost is 6*70 +13*30=420+390=810. So yes. But T=9 is larger than 6.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation with T=9 gave S=6. So 9+6=15 items. So that's the maximum T possible under the condition that the total is exactly 810.\n\nSo the maximum number of trousers is 9. So the answer is option A)9 Trousers.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any higher T that is a multiple of 3 and within the limit. So after T=9, the next would be T=12, but 7*12=84, which is over 81, so that's not possible. So yes, T=9 is the maximum.\n",

To simplify, divide the entire equation by 10:\n\\[\n7T + 3S = 81\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Express \\(S\\) in terms of \\(T\\)\nRearranging the equation:\n\\[\n3S = 81 - 7T \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad S = \\frac{81 - 7T}{3}\n\\]\nFor \\(S\\) to be an integer, \\(81 - 7T\\) must be divisible by 3. Since \\(81 \\mod 3 = 0\\) and \\(7 \\mod 3 = 1\\), \\(T\\) must be a multiple of 3 to satisfy the divisibility condition.\n\n### Step 3: Find the maximum \\(T\\)\nThe maximum value of \\(T\\) is constrained by:\n\\[\n7T \\leq 81 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad T \\leq \\frac{81}{7} \\approx 11.57\n\\]\nThus, \\(T\\) can be at most 11. However, \\(T\\) must also be a multiple of 3. The largest multiple of 3 less than or equal to 11 is \\(T = 9\\).\n\n### Step 4: Verify \\(T = 9\\)\nSubstitute \\(T = 9\\) into the equation:\n\\[\n7(9) + 3S = 81 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 63 + 3S = 81 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 3S = 18 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad S = 6\n\\]\nThis gives a valid solution: \\(T = 9\\) and \\(S = 6\\). The total cost is:\n\\[\n9 \\times 70 + 6 \\times 30 = 630 + 180 = 810\n\\]\nThis satisfies the condition of spending exactly 810 rupees.\n\n### Step 5: Check other options\n- \\(T = 11\\): Substituting \\(T = 11\\) gives \\(S = 1\\), but the total cost is \\(11 \\times 70 + 1 \\times 30 = 770 + 30 = 800\\), leaving 10 rupees unspent, which is invalid.\n- \\(T = 10\\): Substituting \\(T = 10\\) gives \\(S = 3.666\\), which is not an integer, so this is invalid.\n- \\(T = 8\\): Substituting \\(T = 8\\) gives \\(S = 8.333\\), which is not an integer, so this is invalid.\n- \\(T = 7\\): Substituting \\(T = 7\\) gives \\(S = 10.666\\), which is not an integer, so this is invalid.\n\nThus, the maximum valid \\(T\\) is 9.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe maximum number of trousers that can be purchased is **9**, and the corresponding number of shirts is **6**. Therefore, the ratio of trousers to shirts is \\(9:6\\), but the question only asks for the number of trousers when the maximum is purchased.\n\nAnswer: A",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is about a man who spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. Trousers cost 70 each and shirts cost 30 each. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased.\n\nHmm, I think the first thing I should do is understand what's being asked. The key here is that the man wants to buy as many trousers as possible. So, I guess I need to maximize the number of trousers while staying within the 810 rupees budget.\n\nLet me think about how to set this up. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. The total cost equation would then be 70*T + 30*S = 810. Right?\n\nSince the goal is to maximize T, I need to find the largest possible integer value for T such that 70*T is less than or equal to 810, and then see what S would be. But wait, the problem mentions a ratio, so maybe I need to find the number of shirts that allows T to be as large as possible without exceeding the budget.\n\nLet me approach this systematically. Let's find the maximum T possible. The maximum number of trousers would be when the remaining money is used to buy shirts. So, first, find how many trousers can be bought with 810 rupees.\n\nSo, T_max = 810 // 70. Let me calculate that. 70 times 11 is 770, which is under 810. 70 times 12 is 840, which is over. So T_max is 11, but wait, 11*70 is 770, leaving 810-770=40. But shirts cost 30 each. 40 divided by 30 is 1.333, which isn't an integer. So that's a problem because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So T=11 isn't possible because 40 isn't enough to buy another shirt, and the man is probably buying some shirts as well.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem allows for buying zero shirts. Wait, the question says he buys both, I think. Let me check the original question again. Oh, no, it just says he spends 810 on buying trousers and shirts. So he could buy zero shirts if needed. But in that case, the maximum T would be 810/70 = 11.57. So maximum integer T is 11. But then the remaining money is 40, which isn't enough for another shirt. So if he buys 11 trousers, that's 770, and the remaining 40 can't buy any shirts because each shirt is 30, but 40 >=30? Wait, 40 is more than 30. Wait, 40 can buy one shirt for 30, leaving 10. But 10 isn't enough for another shirt. So if he buys 11 trousers, he can buy 1 shirt, and have 10 left, which isn't enough. So that's possible.\n\nWait, but wait, 70*11 = 770. 30*1=30. Total is 800. 810-800=10. So that's correct. So the total is 800, but he has 10 rupees left. But the question says he spends 810, so maybe he can't have any leftover money. Oh, because he spends exactly 810. So he can't have 10 left. So 11 trousers and 1 shirt only sum to 800. So that's not 810. So that won't work. So that means T can't be 11, because that would leave him with 10 rupees, which isn't allowed.\n\nHmm, so maybe the maximum number of T that allows the total to be exactly 810. Let me think again. So, 70T +30S =810. Let's simplify this equation. I can divide both sides by 10 to make it easier: 7T +3S =81.\n\nNow, we're looking for integer solutions where T is as large as possible. Let's express S in terms of T: 3S=81-7T \u2192 S=(81-7T)/3. S has to be an integer \u22650.\n\nSo, 81-7T must be divisible by 3 and non-negative. So let's find T such that 81-7T \u22650 and (81-7T) mod 3 =0.\n\nSince 81 mod 3 is 0 (because 8+1=9, which is divisible by 3), and 7 mod 3 is 1. So 7T mod3 is (7 mod3)*T mod3 \u2192 1*T mod3. So 81-7T mod3 = 0 - T mod3. Which must be 0. So T mod3 must be 0. So T has to be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo T can be 0,3,6,9, etc., but we want the maximum possible T. Let's find the maximum T where 7T \u226481.\n\n7T \u226481 \u2192 T \u2264 81/7 \u224811.57. So maximum possible T is 11, but as we saw earlier, 11 is not a multiple of 3. Next lower multiple is 9.\n\nLet's check T=9.\n\n7*9=63. 81-63=18. 18/3=6. So S=6. So total cost is 9*70 +6*30 =630 +180=810. Perfect.\n\nSo the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6. Which simplifies to 3:2. But the question isn't asking for the ratio's simplified form; it's asking for the number of trousers when maximum is bought. So the maximum number is 9, so the ratio would be 9 trousers to 6 shirts. But looking at the options, the options are about the number of trousers. The options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought T=11 is possible, but then realized that the total would be 800, which leaves 10 unspent. So that's not allowed because he must spend exactly 810. So the next possible T is 9.\n\nWait, but let me check T=10. Because 10 is not a multiple of 3. So T=10, let's see if it works. Let's plug into 7T +3S =81.\n\n7*10=70. 81-70=11. 11/3 is not an integer. So S would be 3.666..., which isn't allowed. So T=10 is invalid.\n\nWhat about T=8? Let's check. 7*8=56. 81-56=25. 25/3 is about 8.333, which isn't an integer. So no.\n\nT=7: 7*7=49. 81-49=32. 32/3 \u224810.666. No.\n\nT=6: 7*6=42. 81-42=39. 39/3=13. So S=13. That's valid. So total cost is 6*70 +13*30=420+390=810. So yes. But T=9 is larger than 6.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation with T=9 gave S=6. So 9+6=15 items. So that's the maximum T possible under the condition that the total is exactly 810.\n\nSo the maximum number of trousers is 9. So the answer is option A)9 Trousers.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any higher T that is a multiple of 3 and within the limit. So after T=9, the next would be T=12, but 7*12=84, which is over 81, so that's not possible. So yes, T=9 is the maximum.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased with 810 rupees, given that each trouser costs 70 rupees and each shirt costs 30 rupees. The total expenditure must equal 810 rupees, and the number of shirts must be an integer.\n\n### Step 1: Set up the equation\nThe total cost equation is:\n\\[\n70T + 30S = 810\n\\]\nwhere \\(T\\) is the number of trousers and \\(S\\) is the number of shirts.

Since \\(81 \\mod 3 = 0\\) and \\(7 \\mod 3 = 1\\), \\(T\\) must be a multiple of 3 to satisfy the divisibility condition.\n\n### Step 3: Find the maximum \\(T\\)\nThe maximum value of \\(T\\) is constrained by:\n\\[\n7T \\leq 81 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad T \\leq \\frac{81}{7} \\approx 11.57\n\\]\nThus, \\(T\\) can be at most 11.

The total cost is:\n\\[\n9 \\times 70 + 6 \\times 30 = 630 + 180 = 810\n\\]\nThis satisfies the condition of spending exactly 810 rupees.\n\n### Step 5: Check other options\n- \\(T = 11\\): Substituting \\(T = 11\\) gives \\(S = 1\\), but the total cost is \\(11 \\times 70 + 1 \\times 30 = 770 + 30 = 800\\), leaving 10 rupees unspent, which is invalid.\n- \\(T = 10\\): Substituting \\(T = 10\\) gives \\(S = 3.666\\), which is not an integer, so this is invalid.\n- \\(T = 8\\): Substituting \\(T = 8\\) gives \\(S = 8.333\\), which is not an integer, so this is invalid.\n- \\(T = 7\\): Substituting \\(T = 7\\) gives \\(S = 10.666\\), which is not an integer, so this is invalid.\n\nThus, the maximum valid \\(T\\) is 9.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe maximum number of trousers that can be purchased is **9**, and the corresponding number of shirts is **6**.

The trousers cost 70 each and shirts are 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers possible. The options given are various numbers of trousers, from 7 to 11, and I need to pick which one is correct.\n\nHmm, so the first thing I think is that this is a problem involving equations and maybe some optimization. Because he's trying to buy as many trousers as possible, so we're looking for the maximum number of trousers he can buy without exceeding his total budget of 810 rupees.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's say he buys 't' number of trousers and 's' number of shirts. Each trouser is 70, so the cost for trousers is 70t, and each shirt is 30, so shirts cost 30s. The total cost is 70t + 30s = 810.\n\nBut wait, he wants to maximize the number of trousers. So we need to find the maximum integer value of t such that 70t is less than or equal to 810, and the remaining money is used to buy shirts.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe he buys both trousers and shirts, but the maximum t possible. So perhaps we can think of the equation as 70t +30s=810, and we need to find integer solutions for t and s, with t as large as possible.\n\nSo first, let's find the maximum possible t. That would be when the money spent on shirts is zero. So 70t = 810 \u2192 t = 810 /70. Let me calculate that.\n\n810 divided by 70. 70 times 11 is 770. 770 is less than 810. 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So 11 would be too much because 11*70 is 770, which leaves 810-770=40 for shirts. But shirts are 30 each, so 40 divided by 30 is 1.333, which isn't an integer. So he can't buy a fraction of a shirt.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe if he buys 11 trousers, he can't buy any shirts because 11*70 is 770, leaving 40, which isn't enough for a shirt (since each shirt is 30). Wait, 40 is more than 30. So 40-30=10, but then he can't buy another shirt because he needs another 30. So he can buy one shirt with that 40. So 11 trousers and 1 shirt, but wait, 11*70=770 + 1*30=30 \u2192 total 800. That's under 810, so he has 10 rupees left, which isn't enough for another shirt. So that's possible. But is 11 the maximum?\n\nWait, but if he buys 11 trousers, the total cost is 770, leaving 40 for shirts. So 40 /30 is 1 and 10/30, so he can buy 1 shirt, spending 30, leaving 10. So total cost is 770 +30=800, which is within 810. So that's possible, but is 11 the maximum? Because 12 is too much.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum t is 11, but let's check other possibilities.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to have a higher t by adjusting the number of shirts to fit exactly into the budget. Let me think. Let's see: 70t +30s=810.\n\nWe can write this as 7t +3s = 81, because I can divide the entire equation by 10.\n\nSo 7t +3s =81.\n\nWe're looking for integer values of t and s where t is as large as possible.\n\nSo, for t to be as large as possible, let's try t=11: 7*11=77. 81-77=4. So 3s=4 \u2192 s=4/3, which is not an integer. So t=11 isn't possible because s would not be an integer.\n\nSo next, t=10: 7*10=70. 81-70=11. So 3s=11 \u2192 s=11/3 \u22483.666, which is not integer. So no.\n\nt=9: 7*9=63. 81-63=18. 3s=18 \u2192 s=6. So s=6. That works. So t=9 and s=6.\n\nSo the maximum t is 9. Because t=10 and t=11 don't give integer s.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought of t=11, the remaining 40 could buy one shirt, but that would leave 10, which isn't enough for another shirt. So perhaps the total would be 11 trousers and 1 shirt, but that's 770+30=800, which is under 810. But the problem is that the maximum number of trousers is when he uses all the money, or as much as possible.\n\nWait, but the problem says he spends 810 in total, so he must use exactly 810. So 70t +30s =810.\n\nSo, the t has to be such that 810 -70t is divisible by 30.\n\nSo, for t=9: 810-70*9 =810-630=180. 180/30=6. So s=6. That's correct.\n\nt=10: 810-700=110. 110/30 is 3.666... No.\n\nt=11: 810-770=40. 40/30=1.333... No.\n\nt=8: 810-560=250. 250/30=8.333... No.\n\nt=7: 810-490=320. 320/30=10.666... No.\n\nt=6: 810-420=390. 390/30=13. So s=13. So that's possible. But since t=9 is higher than t=6, t=9 is better.\n\nSo the maximum t is 9, with s=6.\n\nWait, but when t=9, the total cost is 70*9=630. 630 +30*6=630+180=810. Perfect.\n\nSo the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6. Simplify that: both are divisible by 3. 9/3=3, 6/3=2. So 3:2.\n\nBut the question asks for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the options are the number of trousers, not the ratio.\n\nWait, the options are A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. So the correct answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So maximum t is 9. So the answer is A.\n",

So 3s=4 \u2192 s=4/3, which is not an integer. So t=11 isn't possible because s would not be an integer.\n\nSo next, t=10: 7*10=70. 81-70=11. So 3s=11 \u2192 s=11/3 \u22483.666, which is not integer. So no.\n\nt=9: 7*9=63. 81-63=18. 3s=18 \u2192 s=6. So s=6. That works. So t=9 and s=6.\n\nSo the maximum t is 9. Because t=10 and t=11 don't give integer s.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought of t=11, the remaining 40 could buy one shirt, but that would leave 10, which isn't enough for another shirt. So perhaps the total would be 11 trousers and 1 shirt, but that's 770+30=800, which is under 810. But the problem is that the maximum number of trousers is when he uses all the money, or as much as possible.\n\nWait, but the problem says he spends 810 in total, so he must use exactly 810. So 70t +30s =810.\n\nSo, the t has to be such that 810 -70t is divisible by 30.\n\nSo, for t=9: 810-70*9 =810-630=180. 180/30=6. So s=6. That's correct.\n\nt=10: 810-700=110. 110/30 is 3.666... No.\n\nt=11: 810-770=40. 40/30=1.333... No.\n\nt=8: 810-560=250. 250/30=8.333... No.\n\nt=7: 810-490=320. 320/30=10.666... No.\n\nt=6: 810-420=390. 390/30=13. So s=13. So that's possible. But since t=9 is higher than t=6, t=9 is better.\n\nSo the maximum t is 9, with s=6.\n\nWait, but when t=9, the total cost is 70*9=630. 630 +30*6=630+180=810. Perfect.\n\nSo the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6. Simplify that: both are divisible by 3. 9/3=3, 6/3=2. So 3:2.\n\nBut the question asks for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the options are the number of trousers, not the ratio.\n\nWait, the options are A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. So the correct answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So maximum t is 9. So the answer is A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of trousers the man can purchase without exceeding his total budget of 810 rupees. Each trouser costs 70 rupees, and each shirt costs 30 rupees. The total cost equation is:\n\n\\[\n70t + 30s = 810\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( t \\) is the number of trousers and \\( s \\) is the number of shirts. The goal is to maximize \\( t \\) while ensuring \\( s \\) is an integer.\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the equation\nDivide the entire equation by 10 to simplify:\n\n\\[\n7t + 3s = 81\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Maximize \\( t \\)\nTo maximize \\( t \\), we test possible integer values of \\( t \\) starting from the highest possible value and check if \\( s \\) is an integer.\n\n- For \\( t = 11 \\):  \n  \\[\n  7(11) + 3s = 81 \\implies 77 + 3s = 81 \\implies 3s = 4 \\implies s = \\frac{4}{3}\n  \\]  \n  \\( s \\) is not an integer, so \\( t = 11 \\) is not valid.\n\n- For \\( t = 10 \\):  \n  \\[\n  7(10) + 3s = 81 \\implies 70 + 3s = 81 \\implies 3s = 11 \\implies s = \\frac{11}{3}\n  \\]  \n  \\( s \\) is not an integer, so \\( t = 10 \\) is not valid.\n\n- For \\( t = 9 \\):  \n  \\[\n  7(9) + 3s = 81 \\implies 63 + 3s = 81 \\implies 3s = 18 \\implies s = 6\n  \\]  \n  \\( s \\) is an integer, so \\( t = 9 \\) is valid.\n\n- For \\( t = 8 \\):  \n  \\[\n  7(8) + 3s = 81 \\implies 56 + 3s = 81 \\implies 3s = 25 \\implies s = \\frac{25}{3}\n  \\]  \n  \\( s \\) is not an integer, so \\( t = 8 \\) is not valid.\n\n- For \\( t = 7 \\):  \n  \\[\n  7(7) + 3s = 81 \\implies 49 + 3s = 81 \\implies 3s = 32 \\implies s = \\frac{32}{3}\n  \\]  \n  \\( s \\) is not an integer, so \\( t = 7 \\) is not valid.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\nThe maximum integer value of \\( t \\) that satisfies the equation is \\( t = 9 \\), with \\( s = 6 \\). Therefore, the man can purchase 9 trousers and 6 shirts, and the ratio of trousers to shirts is \\( 9:6 \\), which simplifies to \\( 3:2 \\). However, the question only asks for the number of trousers when the maximum number is purchased.\n\nThe correct answer is **9 trousers**, which corresponds to option A.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm a bit new to these kinds of questions, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe problem says a man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. Each trouser costs 70 rupees, and each shirt costs 30 rupees. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are given as A to E, each representing a number of trousers.\n\nHmm, wait, the options are labeled A to E, but each is just a number of trousers. So I think the question is asking for the maximum number of trousers he can buy without exceeding 810 rupees. Because if he buys the maximum number of trousers, then the remaining money would be spent on shirts. So the ratio would be based on that scenario.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. So, let's denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. The total cost is 70*T + 30*S = 810. We need to maximize T, which means we need to find the maximum integer value of T such that the total cost is less than or equal to 810. Then, with the remaining money, we can find S.\n\nSo first, find the maximum T where 70*T \u2264 810. Let's compute that. \n\nDivide 810 by 70. Let me do that: 70*11 is 770. Because 70*10=700, plus 70 is 770. 70*12 is 840, which is over 810. So 11 is too much because 770 is less than 810, but wait, 70*11=770. So 70*11=770, and 810-770=40. Wait, but 40 isn't enough to buy a shirt because each shirt is 30. So he can buy one shirt, spending 30, leaving 10. But that's not enough for another shirt. So in this case, if he buys 11 trousers, he can buy 1 shirt, but wait, 70*11 is 770, 30*1 is 30, total 800. That's under 810. So the remaining 10 can't buy anything else. Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to maximize T, which would mean buying as many as possible. So, 810 divided by 70 is approximately 11.57. So the maximum integer T is 11, but let's check if 11*70 is within 810.\n\n70*11=770. 770 is less than 810, so yes. Then, the remaining money is 810-770=40. With 40, how many shirts can he buy? Each shirt is 30, so 40/30 is 1.333. So he can buy 1 shirt, using 30, leaving 10. So the number of shirts is 1.\n\nWait, but maybe I can buy more shirts by reducing the number of trousers. Because if buying 11 trousers uses 770, then 40 remains. But if I buy 10 trousers, that's 700, leaving 110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666, so 3 shirts, spending 90, with 20 left. But that's more shirts than if I bought 11 trousers. But the question is about when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So he buys as many as possible, which is 11.\n\nSo the ratio of trousers to shirts would be 11 to 1. So the ratio is 11:1. But looking at the options, the options are just the number of trousers, but the question is about the ratio. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, the options are given as A)9, B)8, etc. So perhaps the options are the number of trousers, and the question is asking for that number when maximum is bought, but the question says \"what will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So perhaps the ratio is T:S, and the options are the possible T values, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again. \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So the ratio is T:S, and the maximum T is being bought. So in that scenario, the T is maximum, so S is the maximum possible given that T is maximum.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this systematically.\n\nWe need to maximize T, so T is as large as possible without exceeding the total amount.\n\nLet me compute T_max: 810 /70 = 11.571, so T_max is 11.\n\nSo 11 trousers cost 770. Remaining money: 810-770=40.\n\nWith 40, how many shirts can be bought? 40 /30 = 1.333, so 1 shirt.\n\nSo the ratio is T:S =11:1.\n\nBut the options are just numbers of trousers, not the ratios. Wait, the options are A)9, B)8, etc. So perhaps the question is asking for the number of trousers when maximum is purchased, but the options don't include 11. Wait, looking back: the options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11. Oh, option E is 11. So the answer would be E)11 Trousers. But wait, the question is about the ratio of trousers to shirts, not the number of trousers. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the problem. The question is about the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So after buying 11 trousers, he can buy 1 shirt. So the ratio is 11:1. But the options are just the number of trousers. So perhaps the question is actually asking for the maximum number of trousers, which is 11, so the answer is E.\n\nWait, but the question says \"what will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So the ratio would be 11:1, but the options don't have that. The options are E)11, which would be the number of trousers. So perhaps the question is simply asking for the number of trousers when maximum is bought, not the ratio. But the wording says 'ratio'. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that when maximum number of trousers is bought, the ratio is something else. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, or I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers, which is 11, and thus can buy 1 shirt. So the ratio is 11:1.\n\nBut the options don't include a ratio. They only include the number of trousers. So perhaps the question is asking for the number of trousers when the maximum is bought, which would be 11, so the answer is E.\n\nBut then why is the question about the ratio?

So the options are the possible T values, and the correct answer is E)11.\n\nSo the answer would be E)11 Trousers.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: A man spends 810 rupees buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. What will be the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased?\n\nWait, the options are all just numbers of trousers, like 9,8, etc. So maybe the question is actually asking what's the maximum number of trousers he can buy without exceeding the total amount, and then find out the ratio of trousers to shirts in that case.\n\nHmm, okay. So the man has 810 rupees. Trousers cost 70 each, shirts 30 each. We need to maximize the number of trousers, which makes sense because buying more of the cheaper item (shirt) would leave less for the more expensive trousers, but since we want max trousers, we should buy as many as possible with the money.\n\nSo let's model this. Let's say he buys x number of trousers and y number of shirts. The total cost is 70x +30y = 810. We need to find the maximum possible integer x such that 70x is less than or equal to 810, and the remaining money can buy some number of shirts (so that 30y is equal to the remaining money).\n\nWait, but maybe the remaining money doesn't have to be exactly used for shirts. Or does it? Because the problem says he spends all 810, so 70x +30y must equal exactly 810. So the total cost must add up to exactly 810.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says he \"spends 810 in buying\". So he could have some money left, but the way the question is phrased, I think he's spending exactly 810. Or maybe not? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me read the problem again.\n\n\"A man spend 810 in buying trouser at Rs 70 each and shirt at 30 each.\" So yes, he spends exactly 810. So 70x +30y = 810.\n\nWe need to maximize x (number of trousers). So, to find the maximum x possible, we can think that the remaining money after buying x trousers should be exactly divisible by 30, because y has to be an integer.\n\nSo, let's approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, find the maximum x such that 70x \u2264810.\n\nSo 810 divided by 70 is... let's calculate. 70 times 11 is 770, because 70*10=700, 70*11=770. 70*12=840, which is more than 810. So maximum possible x is 11. But wait, 11*70=770, leaving 810-770=40. But 40 isn't divisible by 30. Because shirts are 30 each. So 40 /30 is 1.333, which isn't an integer. So y can't be 1.333. So x=11 isn't possible because y would have to be a fraction, which isn't allowed.\n\nSo we need to find the largest x where 810 -70x is divisible by 30, and the result is a non-negative integer y.\n\nSo let's start checking x from the maximum possible downwards.\n\nMaximum x is 11, but 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40 divided by 30 is 1.333, not integer.

The equation governing the total cost is:\n\n\\[\n70x + 30y = 810\n\\]\n\nTo maximize \\( x \\), we start by finding the largest integer \\( x \\) such that \\( 70x \\leq 810 \\).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: A man spends 810 rupees buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. What will be the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased?\n\nWait, the options are all just numbers of trousers, like 9,8, etc. So maybe the question is actually asking what's the maximum number of trousers he can buy without exceeding the total amount, and then find out the ratio of trousers to shirts in that case.\n\nHmm, okay. So the man has 810 rupees. Trousers cost 70 each, shirts 30 each. We need to maximize the number of trousers, which makes sense because buying more of the cheaper item (shirt) would leave less for the more expensive trousers, but since we want max trousers, we should buy as many as possible with the money.\n\nSo let's model this. Let's say he buys x number of trousers and y number of shirts. The total cost is 70x +30y = 810. We need to find the maximum possible integer x such that 70x is less than or equal to 810, and the remaining money can buy some number of shirts (so that 30y is equal to the remaining money).\n\nWait, but maybe the remaining money doesn't have to be exactly used for shirts. Or does it? Because the problem says he spends all 810, so 70x +30y must equal exactly 810. So the total cost must add up to exactly 810.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says he \"spends 810 in buying\". So he could have some money left, but the way the question is phrased, I think he's spending exactly 810. Or maybe not? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me read the problem again.\n\n\"A man spend 810 in buying trouser at Rs 70 each and shirt at 30 each.\" So yes, he spends exactly 810. So 70x +30y = 810.\n\nWe need to maximize x (number of trousers). So, to find the maximum x possible, we can think that the remaining money after buying x trousers should be exactly divisible by 30, because y has to be an integer.\n\nSo, let's approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, find the maximum x such that 70x \u2264810.\n\nSo 810 divided by 70 is... let's calculate. 70 times 11 is 770, because 70*10=700, 70*11=770. 70*12=840, which is more than 810. So maximum possible x is 11. But wait, 11*70=770, leaving 810-770=40. But 40 isn't divisible by 30. Because shirts are 30 each. So 40 /30 is 1.333, which isn't an integer. So y can't be 1.333. So x=11 isn't possible because y would have to be a fraction, which isn't allowed.\n\nSo we need to find the largest x where 810 -70x is divisible by 30, and the result is a non-negative integer y.\n\nSo let's start checking x from the maximum possible downwards.\n\nMaximum x is 11, but 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40 divided by 30 is 1.333, not integer. So invalid.\n\nNext, x=10. 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666... Not integer. So no.\n\nx=9. 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. So y=6. That works. So x=9, y=6. So the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So the maximum number of trousers he can buy is 9, because 10 and 11 don't work because y isn't integer.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me check x=10 again. 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666. So that's not an integer. So y=3.666 is not possible. So x can't be 10.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. A man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. Each trouser costs 70 rupees and each shirt costs 30 rupees. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are labeled A to E, each giving a number of trousers.\n\nHmm, I think the first thing I need to do is set up some equations. Let me denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. So, the total cost is the cost of all the trousers plus the cost of all the shirts, right?\n\nSo the equation would be: 70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nAnd the goal is to maximize the number of trousers, T. So I need to find the maximum integer value of T such that S is also an integer because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt or trouser.\n\nWait, so how do I approach this? Maybe I can rearrange the equation to express S in terms of T. Let's try that.\n\nSo, 70T + 30S = 810.\n\nSubtract 70T from both sides: 30S = 810 -70T.\n\nThen, divide both sides by 30: S = (810 -70T)/30.\n\nSimplify that: 810 divided by 30 is 27. 70 divided by 30 is 7/3. So, S = 27 - (7/3)T.\n\nHmm, but S has to be an integer because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So 27 - (7/3)T must be an integer. Let me think about this. So (7/3)T must result in a number that, when subtracted from 27, gives an integer. \n\nWait, 7 and 3 are co-prime. So for (7/3)T to be an integer, T must be a multiple of 3. Because 7 is not divisible by 3, so T has to have 3 as a factor to make 7T/3 an integer. So T must be 3k, where k is some integer.\n\nSo let me let T = 3k. Then S would be 27 - (7/3)(3k) = 27 -7k.\n\nNow, S has to be greater than or equal to zero because you can't buy a negative number of shirts. So 27 -7k >= 0.\n\nSo 27 >=7k \u2192 k <= 27/7. 27 divided by 7 is approximately 3.857. Since k must be an integer, the maximum k is 3.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Wait, when I set T =3k, and k=3, T would be 9. Let me check if that's the maximum possible.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to have a higher T without S becoming negative. Let's think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that T must be such that 810 -70T is divisible by 30. Because 30S must be an integer.\n\nSo 810 -70T must be a multiple of 30. Let's see. 70 is 70, so 70T mod 30 must be equal to 810 mod 30. 810 divided by 30 is 27, so 810 mod 30 is 0. So 70T mod30 must be 0.\n\nWhat's 70 mod30? 70 divided by 30 is 2 with a remainder of 10. So 70 \u226110 mod30. So 70T \u226110T mod30.\n\nSo 10T must be congruent to 0 mod30. That is, 10T must be a multiple of 30.\n\nSo 10T =30m, where m is an integer.\n\nDivide both sides by 10: T=3m.\n\nSo T must be a multiple of 3. So possible T values are 3,6,9,12,... but since we have a total of 810, the maximum T can't be more than 810/70, which is approximately 11.57. So T can be up to 11, but it has to be a multiple of 3. So possible Ts are 3,6,9,12. Wait, wait 12*70=840 which is more than 810. So the maximum possible T is 11, but only if 11 is a multiple of 3, which it's not. So the next lower multiple is 9. So T=9 would give S=27 -7*(9/3) =27-21=6 shirts.\n\nWait, let me calculate that. T=9, so S=(810-70*9)/30. 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. So S=6. That's an integer, so that's valid.\n\nBut wait, what if T is 12? 70*12=840, which is more than 810. So that's not possible. So the maximum T is 9. So the ratio is T:S=9:6. Which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the options given are the number of trousers, so the answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's a higher T possible. Suppose T=10. Let's see: 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666..., which is not an integer. So S isn't an integer, so that's invalid.\n\nSimilarly, T=11: 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40/30 is 1.333..., which isn't integer. So invalid.\n\nT=8: 70*8=560. 810-560=250. 250/30 is about 8.333, not integer.\n\nT=7: 70*7=490. 810-490=320. 320/30=10.666..., not integer.\n\nT=6: 70*6=420. 810-420=390. 390/30=13. So S=13. But T=6 is less than 9, so 9 is better.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9, giving S=6. So the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2, but the question only asks for the number of trousers when the maximum is bought. So the correct answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, looking at the options, A is 9 Trousers. So the answer should be A.\n",

So I need to find the maximum integer value of T such that S is also an integer because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt or trouser.\n\nWait, so how do I approach this? Maybe I can rearrange the equation to express S in terms of T. Let's try that.\n\nSo, 70T + 30S = 810.\n\nSubtract 70T from both sides: 30S = 810 -70T.\n\nThen, divide both sides by 30: S = (810 -70T)/30.\n\nSimplify that: 810 divided by 30 is 27. 70 divided by 30 is 7/3. So, S = 27 - (7/3)T.\n\nHmm, but S has to be an integer because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So 27 - (7/3)T must be an integer. Let me think about this. So (7/3)T must result in a number that, when subtracted from 27, gives an integer. \n\nWait, 7 and 3 are co-prime. So for (7/3)T to be an integer, T must be a multiple of 3. Because 7 is not divisible by 3, so T has to have 3 as a factor to make 7T/3 an integer. So T must be 3k, where k is some integer.\n\nSo let me let T = 3k. Then S would be 27 - (7/3)(3k) = 27 -7k.\n\nNow, S has to be greater than or equal to zero because you can't buy a negative number of shirts. So 27 -7k >= 0.\n\nSo 27 >=7k \u2192 k <= 27/7. 27 divided by 7 is approximately 3.857. Since k must be an integer, the maximum k is 3.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Wait, when I set T =3k, and k=3, T would be 9. Let me check if that's the maximum possible.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to have a higher T without S becoming negative. Let's think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that T must be such that 810 -70T is divisible by 30. Because 30S must be an integer.\n\nSo 810 -70T must be a multiple of 30. Let's see. 70 is 70, so 70T mod 30 must be equal to 810 mod 30. 810 divided by 30 is 27, so 810 mod 30 is 0. So 70T mod30 must be 0.\n\nWhat's 70 mod30? 70 divided by 30 is 2 with a remainder of 10. So 70 \u226110 mod30. So 70T \u226110T mod30.\n\nSo 10T must be congruent to 0 mod30. That is, 10T must be a multiple of 30.\n\nSo 10T =30m, where m is an integer.\n\nDivide both sides by 10: T=3m.\n\nSo T must be a multiple of 3. So possible T values are 3,6,9,12,... but since we have a total of 810, the maximum T can't be more than 810/70, which is approximately 11.57. So T can be up to 11, but it has to be a multiple of 3. So possible Ts are 3,6,9,12. Wait, wait 12*70=840 which is more than 810. So the maximum possible T is 11, but only if 11 is a multiple of 3, which it's not. So the next lower multiple is 9. So T=9 would give S=27 -7*(9/3) =27-21=6 shirts.\n\nWait, let me calculate that. T=9, so S=(810-70*9)/30. 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. So S=6. That's an integer, so that's valid.\n\nBut wait, what if T is 12? 70*12=840, which is more than 810. So that's not possible. So the maximum T is 9. So the ratio is T:S=9:6. Which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the options given are the number of trousers, so the answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's a higher T possible. Suppose T=10. Let's see: 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666..., which is not an integer. So S isn't an integer, so that's invalid.\n\nSimilarly, T=11: 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40/30 is 1.333..., which isn't integer. So invalid.\n\nT=8: 70*8=560. 810-560=250. 250/30 is about 8.333, not integer.\n\nT=7: 70*7=490. 810-490=320. 320/30=10.666..., not integer.\n\nT=6: 70*6=420. 810-420=390. 390/30=13. So S=13. But T=6 is less than 9, so 9 is better.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9, giving S=6. So the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2, but the question only asks for the number of trousers when the maximum is bought. So the correct answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, looking at the options, A is 9 Trousers. So the answer should be A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by defining the number of trousers as \\( T \\) and the number of shirts as \\( S \\). The total cost equation is:\n\n\\[\n70T + 30S = 810\n\\]\n\nRearranging for \\( S \\):\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{810 - 70T}{30}\n\\]\n\nFor \\( S \\) to be an integer, \\( 810 - 70T \\) must be divisible by 30. Simplifying \\( 70 \\mod 30 = 10 \\), so \\( 10T \\) must be a multiple of 30. This implies \\( T \\) must be a multiple of 3. Let \\( T = 3k \\), where \\( k \\) is an integer. Substituting \\( T = 3k \\) into the equation for \\( S \\):\n\n\\[\nS = 27 - 7k\n\\]\n\nSince \\( S \\geq 0 \\), we have \\( 27 - 7k \\geq 0 \\), which gives \\( k \\leq \\frac{27}{7} \\approx 3.857 \\). Thus, \\( k \\) can be at most 3, making \\( T = 3k = 9 \\). \n\nTo verify, substituting \\( T = 9 \\) into the cost equation:\n\n\\[\n70(9) + 30S = 810 \\implies 630 + 30S = 810 \\implies 30S = 180 \\implies S = 6\n\\]\n\nThis is valid, as \\( S = 6 \\) is an integer. Checking higher values of \\( T \\) (e.g., \\( T = 10, 11 \\)) results in non-integer values of \\( S \\), making them invalid. Similarly, lower values of \\( T \\) (e.g., \\( T = 6, 7, 8 \\)) are valid but do not maximize \\( T \\).\n\nThus, the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased is 9, and the corresponding ratio of trousers to shirts is \\( 9:6 \\), which simplifies to \\( 3:2 \\). However, the question only asks for the number of trousers when the maximum is purchased.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about a man who spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. Trousers cost 70 each and shirts are 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers possible. The options are from A to E, each giving a number of trousers.\n\nWait, so the main goal is to maximize the number of trousers. That makes sense because the question says so. So I think I should start by setting up an equation where the total cost is 810. Let me denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S.\n\nSo, the equation would be 70*T + 30*S = 810. Right, because each trouser is 70 and each shirt 30.\n\nBut since we're trying to maximize T, we need to find the maximum integer value of T such that the remaining amount can be exactly divided by the shirt's price, which is 30. Because if the remaining amount after buying T trousers isn't a multiple of 30, he can't buy a whole number of shirts, right?\n\nSo let's rearrange the equation. Let's solve for S: 30*S = 810 - 70*T. So S = (810 -70*T)/30.\n\nHmm, I can simplify this. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 10 first. So S = (81 -7*T)/3.\n\nWait, because 810 divided by 10 is 81, and 70 divided by 10 is 7, and 30 divided by 10 is 3. So yeah, S = (81 -7T)/3.\n\nSince S has to be an integer (you can't buy a fraction of a shirt), the numerator (81 -7T) must be divisible by 3. So (81 -7T) mod 3 should be zero.\n\nLet me think about this. 81 is divisible by 3 because 8+1=9, which is divisible by 3. So 81 mod 3 is 0. What about 7T? 7 mod 3 is 1, because 7 divided by 3 is 2 with a remainder of 1. So 7T mod 3 is same as (1*T) mod 3, which is T mod 3.\n\nSo the condition is that (0 - (T mod 3)) must be 0 mod 3. Because 81 mod 3 is 0, and 7T mod 3 is T mod 3. So the equation is 0 - (T mod 3) \u2261 0 mod 3. Which implies that T mod 3 must be 0. So T has to be a multiple of 3.\n\nWait, but that's not the only condition. Because we're trying to maximize T, we need the largest possible T such that 70*T \u2264 810, and also that (810 -70*T) is divisible by 30.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is better. Let me calculate the maximum possible T without considering shirts. The maximum T would be when all the money is spent on trousers. So 810 divided by 70 is what? Let me calculate that.\n\n70 times 11 is 770, because 70*10=700, plus 70 is 770. 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So maximum possible T without shirts is 11. But wait, 70*11 = 770, and 810-770=40. 40 isn't divisible by 30. So he can't buy 11 trousers because that would leave 40, which isn't enough for a shirt (needs 30) but he can't buy a fraction. So 40 is less than 30, so no shirt can be bought. Wait, but the question says he buys both, right? Or does it?\n\nWait, no. The problem says he buys trousers and shirts. So he must buy at least one of each? Or is it possible that he buys all trousers and no shirts, but that's not the case here because the question is about the ratio when maximum number of trousers is purchased. Wait, no, the problem says he buys both. Because the question is about the ratio of trousers and shirts, so he must have bought both.\n\nWait, but the way the question is phrased: \"the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So he can buy as many as possible, but he must have bought some shirts as well because otherwise, the ratio would be undefined (division by zero). So we can't have S=0.\n\nSo, going back. So T can be maximum as much as possible, but S must be at least 1. So 810 -70*T must be at least 30, because each shirt is 30, and he needs to buy at least one.\n\nSo 810 -70*T >=30. So 70*T <=780. So T <=780/70. Let's compute that: 70*11 is 770, which is less than 780. 70*11=770, 70*12=840>780. So T can be up to 11, but only if 810-70*11 is >=30 and is divisible by 30.\n\nWait, 810-70*11=810-770=40. 40 is not divisible by 30, so that's not possible. So the next lower T would be 10. Let's check T=10.\n\n70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666... which is not an integer. So S would be 3.666, which isn't possible. So T=10 isn't acceptable.\n\nNext, T=9. 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. So S=6. That's an integer, so that works. So T=9, S=6.\n\nWait, but is 9 the maximum possible T that satisfies the conditions? Let's check T=11, but as we saw, that leaves 40, which is not enough for a shirt. So he can't buy any shirts if T=11, which isn't allowed because he must buy both.\n\nWhat about T=8? 70*8=560. 810-560=250. 250/30 is approximately 8.333. Not integer. So no.\n\nT=7: 70*7=490. 810-490=320. 320/30 is 10.666... Not integer.\n\nT=6: 70*6=420. 810-420=390. 390/30=13. So S=13. That's possible, but T=9 is higher than 6, so 9 is better.\n\nWait, but what about T=10? 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110/30=3.666... So no.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this problem by finding T such that (810 -70T) is divisible by 30, and that 810-70T >=30.\n\nSo, let's set up the equation 810 -70T = 30k, where k is the number of shirts, which must be a positive integer.\n\nSo, 70T = 810 -30k.\n\nWe can factor this equation. Let's factor 10 out:\n\n7T = 81 -3k.\n\nSo, 7T = 81 -3k.\n\nWe can write this as 7T +3k =81.\n\nWe need to find integer values of T and k that satisfy this equation, with T and k positive integers.\n\nLet me think about possible T values. Since 7T must be less than 81, T can be at most 11 (since 7*11=77 <81, 7*12=84>81).\n\nBut since T must be a positive integer, let's test T from 11 down to see which gives an integer k.\n\nT=11: 7*11=77. 77 +3k=81 \u2192 3k=4 \u2192 k=4/3 \u2192 not integer. So no.\n\nT=10: 7*10=70. 70 +3k=81 \u21923k=11 \u2192 k=11/3\u22483.666. Not integer.\n\nT=9: 7*9=63. 63+3k=81 \u21923k=18 \u2192k=6. That's integer. So yes, T=9, k=6.\n\nT=8: 7*8=56. 56+3k=81 \u21923k=25 \u2192k=25/3\u22488.333. Not integer.\n\nT=7: 7*7=49. 49 +3k=81 \u21923k=32 \u2192k=32/3\u224810.666. Not integer.\n\nT=6: 7*6=42. 42 +3k=81 \u21923k=39 \u2192k=13. So T=6, k=13. That's possible, but T=9 is higher, so we prefer T=9.\n\nSo the maximum number of trousers is 9, with 6 shirts. So the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question asks for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased, so the ratio is 9:6, but the options give the number of trousers, not the ratio. Wait, no, wait the options are A)9, etc. So the question is asking for the number of trousers, which is 9, so the correct answer is option A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The options are A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. So the correct answer is A, 9.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the calculation for T=9. 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6 shirts. Yes, that's correct. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2, but the question isn't about the ratio value; it's asking for the number of trousers when maximum is bought. So the answer is 9, option A.\n",

So no.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this problem by finding T such that (810 -70T) is divisible by 30, and that 810-70T >=30.\n\nSo, let's set up the equation 810 -70T = 30k, where k is the number of shirts, which must be a positive integer.\n\nSo, 70T = 810 -30k.\n\nWe can factor this equation. Let's factor 10 out:\n\n7T = 81 -3k.\n\nSo, 7T = 81 -3k.\n\nWe can write this as 7T +3k =81.\n\nWe need to find integer values of T and k that satisfy this equation, with T and k positive integers.\n\nLet me think about possible T values. Since 7T must be less than 81, T can be at most 11 (since 7*11=77 <81, 7*12=84>81).\n\nBut since T must be a positive integer, let's test T from 11 down to see which gives an integer k.\n\nT=11: 7*11=77. 77 +3k=81 \u2192 3k=4 \u2192 k=4/3 \u2192 not integer. So no.\n\nT=10: 7*10=70. 70 +3k=81 \u21923k=11 \u2192 k=11/3\u22483.666. Not integer.\n\nT=9: 7*9=63. 63+3k=81 \u21923k=18 \u2192k=6. That's integer. So yes, T=9, k=6.\n\nT=8: 7*8=56. 56+3k=81 \u21923k=25 \u2192k=25/3\u22488.333. Not integer.\n\nT=7: 7*7=49. 49 +3k=81 \u21923k=32 \u2192k=32/3\u224810.666. Not integer.\n\nT=6: 7*6=42. 42 +3k=81 \u21923k=39 \u2192k=13. So T=6, k=13. That's possible, but T=9 is higher, so we prefer T=9.\n\nSo the maximum number of trousers is 9, with 6 shirts. So the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question asks for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased, so the ratio is 9:6, but the options give the number of trousers, not the ratio. Wait, no, wait the options are A)9, etc. So the question is asking for the number of trousers, which is 9, so the correct answer is option A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The options are A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. So the correct answer is A, 9.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the calculation for T=9. 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6 shirts. Yes, that's correct. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2, but the question isn't about the ratio value; it's asking for the number of trousers when maximum is bought. So the answer is 9, option A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of trousers (T) that can be purchased with 810 rupees, given that each trouser costs 70 rupees and each shirt costs 30 rupees. The total cost equation is:\n\n\\[\n70T + 30S = 810\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(S\\) is the number of shirts. Rearranging for \\(S\\), we get:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{810 - 70T}{30}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(S\\) must be an integer, the numerator \\((810 - 70T)\\) must be divisible by 30. Additionally, \\(S\\) must be at least 1, so:\n\n\\[\n810 - 70T \\geq 30 \\implies 70T \\leq 780 \\implies T \\leq \\frac{780}{70} \\approx 11.14\n\\]\n\nThus, the maximum possible value for \\(T\\) is 11. We test values of \\(T\\) starting from 11 and check if \\((810 - 70T)\\) is divisible by 30:\n\n1. **\\(T = 11\\):**  \n   \\[\n   70 \\times 11 = 770, \\quad 810 - 770 = 40\n   \\]  \n   \\(40\\) is not divisible by 30, so \\(T = 11\\) is invalid.\n\n2. **\\(T = 10\\):**  \n   \\[\n   70 \\times 10 = 700, \\quad 810 - 700 = 110\n   \\]  \n   \\(110\\) is not divisible by 30, so \\(T = 10\\) is invalid.\n\n3. **\\(T = 9\\):**  \n   \\[\n   70 \\times 9 = 630, \\quad 810 - 630 = 180\n   \\]  \n   \\(180 \\div 30 = 6\\), so \\(S = 6\\). This is valid.\n\n4. **\\(T = 8\\):**  \n   \\[\n   70 \\times 8 = 560, \\quad 810 - 560 = 250\n   \\]  \n   \\(250 \\div 30 \\approx 8.333\\), which is not an integer, so \\(T = 8\\) is invalid.\n\n5. **\\(T = 7\\):**  \n   \\[\n   70 \\times 7 = 490, \\quad 810 - 490 = 320\n   \\]  \n   \\(320 \\div 30 \\approx 10.666\\), which is not an integer, so \\(T = 7\\) is invalid.\n\nFrom the above, the maximum valid value for \\(T\\) is 9, with \\(S = 6\\). Therefore, the ratio of trousers to shirts is \\(9:6\\), but the question specifically asks for the number of trousers when the maximum number is purchased. Thus, the answer is:\n\n**Answer: A**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about a man who spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. Trousers cost 70 each and shirts are 30 each. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are given as A to E, each with a number of trousers.\n\nHmm, so first, I think I need to set up an equation based on the total amount spent. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. Each trouser is 70, so the cost for trousers would be 70*T. Each shirt is 30, so shirts cost 30*S. The total spent is 810, so 70T + 30S = 810.\n\nThe goal is to find the ratio of T to S when T is as large as possible. So, I guess I need to maximize T while ensuring that S is a non-negative integer because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt or negative shirts.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation to solve for S in terms of T. So, 70T + 30S = 810 \u2192 30S = 810 -70T \u2192 S = (810 -70T)/30. Simplify that: S = (810/30) - (70T)/30 \u2192 27 - (7T/3).\n\nWait, S has to be an integer because you can't have a fraction of a shirt. So (7T)/3 must also result in an integer when subtracted from 27. Let me think about that. 7T must be divisible by 3 so that when divided by 3, it's an integer. Because 7 and 3 are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1), T must be a multiple of 3. So T should be 3,6,9, etc. But wait, let me check that again. Let's see: 7T must be divisible by 3. 7 mod 3 is 1, so 7T mod3 is T mod3. So for 7T mod3 to be 0, T must be a multiple of 3. So T has to be 3,6,9,12, etc.\n\nBut since we want the maximum number of trousers, let's find the largest possible T such that S is non-negative. So S = 27 - (7T/3) \u2265 0.\n\nLet me solve for T: 27 \u2265 (7T)/3 \u2192 multiply both sides by 3 \u2192 81 \u22657T \u2192 T \u2264 81/7. Calculating that, 81 divided by 7 is approximately 11.57. Since T has to be an integer, the maximum possible T is 11. But wait, earlier I thought T must be a multiple of 3. So 11 is not a multiple of 3. That's a problem. So the next lower multiple of 3 below 11.57 is 9, because 3*3=9, 3*4=12 which is over 11.57.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the constraints. Because if T isn't a multiple of 3, but 7T is, perhaps that's possible. Let me check. Let's see, 7T must be divisible by 3. So 7T \u22610 mod3. Since 7 \u22611 mod3, this implies T \u22610 mod3. So T must be a multiple of 3. So yes, T has to be 3,6,9,12,... but up to the maximum where S is non-negative.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9 because 9*7=63, 63/3=21, and 27-21=6. So S would be 6. If I try T=12, then 7*12=84, 84/3=28. Then 27-28= -1, which is negative, so that's not allowed. So T=9 is the maximum.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Let me think again. Let's try T=9. Then S would be 27 - (7*9)/3 = 27 - 63/3 =27-21=6. So S=6. So the ratio would be T:S =9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but wait, the options given are the number of trousers, not the ratio. The question says, \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So the options are A)9 Trousers, etc. So the answer is when T is maximum, which is 9. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2, but the question only asks for the ratio when maximum T is bought, which is 9.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me check T=9. 9*70=630. 6*30=180. 630+180=810, which matches the total.\n\nWhat about T=10? Let's see. T=10. Then S=27 - (7*10)/3. 70/3 is about 23.333. 27-23.333 is 3.666. Which is not an integer. So S can't be 3.666, so T=10 isn't allowed because S must be integer.\n\nWhat about T=8? Let me check. T=8. Then S=27 - (7*8)/3. 56/3 is approximately 18.666. 27 -18.666=8.333. Not integer. So no.\n\nT=11: 7*11=77. 77/3 is about 25.666. 27-25.666=1.333. Not integer.\n\nSo the next possible T is 9, which gives S=6.\n\nWait, but what about T=6? S would be 27 - (7*6)/3 =27-14=13. So that's allowed, but T=9 is larger.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9, so the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question is asking for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is bought. The options only give the number of trousers, so the correct option is A)9 Trousers. Wait, but the options are A)9, B)8, etc. So the answer is A.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the ratio, but the options are just the number of trousers. Oh wait, looking back, the question says, \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" The options are labeled with the number of trousers, like option A is 9 Trousers.

The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11. Wait, no, the options are actually labeled with the number of trousers. So the options are A to E, each giving a certain number of trouser counts.\n\nWait, the question says, \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So, I think we're looking for the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts when he buys as many trousers as possible within the 810 rupees.\n\nSo, the approach here would be to maximize the number of trousers, which are more expensive. So first, I should figure out how many trousers he can buy with 810 rupees. Let's see.\n\nEach trouser is 70 rupees. So, to find the maximum number, we divide 810 by 70. Let me calculate that.\n\n810 divided by 70 is... 70 times 11 is 770, right? 70*11=770. 70*12=840 which is more than 810. So he can buy 11 trousers for 770 rupees. But wait, 770 is less than 810, so he has 810 - 770 = 40 rupees left. But can he buy any shirts with that?\n\nEach shirt is 30 rupees. So with 40, he can buy one shirt because 30*1=30, which leaves 10 rupees, but that's not enough for another shirt. So the number of shirts would be 1.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation. 70 * 11 is 770. Then 810-770=40. 40 divided by 30 is 1.333, so only 1 shirt can be bought. So the ratio of trousers to shirts would be 11:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, option E is 11 trousers. So the answer would be E, and the ratio is 11:1.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Another thought: perhaps I should consider that when you maximize the number of trousers, you might not be able to spend all the money if the remainder doesn't allow for any shirts. But in this case, 40 is enough for one shirt. So the maximum number of trousers is 11, and shirts are 1. So the ratio is 11:1.\n\nAlternatively, what if the man couldn't buy any shirts? Like if the remaining money was less than 30, then the number of shirts would be zero. But in this case, 40 is more than 30, so he can buy one shirt.\n\nSo, the ratio is 11 (trousers) to 1 (shirt), so 11:1. Looking at the options, option E is 11, which is the maximum number of trousers. So the correct answer should be E.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where a man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. The trousers cost 70 each and the shirts 30 each. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11. Wait, no, the options are actually labeled with the number of trousers. So the options are A to E, each giving a certain number of trouser counts.\n\nWait, the question says, \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So, I think we're looking for the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts when he buys as many trousers as possible within the 810 rupees.\n\nSo, the approach here would be to maximize the number of trousers, which are more expensive. So first, I should figure out how many trousers he can buy with 810 rupees. Let's see.\n\nEach trouser is 70 rupees. So, to find the maximum number, we divide 810 by 70. Let me calculate that.\n\n810 divided by 70 is... 70 times 11 is 770, right? 70*11=770. 70*12=840 which is more than 810. So he can buy 11 trousers for 770 rupees. But wait, 770 is less than 810, so he has 810 - 770 = 40 rupees left. But can he buy any shirts with that?\n\nEach shirt is 30 rupees. So with 40, he can buy one shirt because 30*1=30, which leaves 10 rupees, but that's not enough for another shirt. So the number of shirts would be 1.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation. 70 * 11 is 770. Then 810-770=40. 40 divided by 30 is 1.333, so only 1 shirt can be bought. So the ratio of trousers to shirts would be 11:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, option E is 11 trousers. So the answer would be E, and the ratio is 11:1.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Another thought: perhaps I should consider that when you maximize the number of trousers, you might not be able to spend all the money if the remainder doesn't allow for any shirts. But in this case, 40 is enough for one shirt. So the maximum number of trousers is 11, and shirts are 1. So the ratio is 11:1.\n\nAlternatively, what if the man couldn't buy any shirts? Like if the remaining money was less than 30, then the number of shirts would be zero. But in this case, 40 is more than 30, so he can buy one shirt.\n\nSo, the ratio is 11 (trousers) to 1 (shirt), so 11:1. Looking at the options, option E is 11, which is the maximum number of trousers. So the correct answer should be E.\n\n\nTo determine the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased, we start by maximizing the number of trousers. Each trouser costs Rs 70, so dividing the total amount (Rs 810) by the cost of one trouser gives:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{810}{70} = 11.57\n\\]\n\nSince the man cannot buy a fraction of a trouser, the maximum number of trousers he can purchase is 11. The cost of 11 trousers is:\n\n\\[\n11 \\times 70 = 770 \\, \\text{Rs}\n\\]\n\nSubtracting this from the total amount leaves:\n\n\\[\n810 - 770 = 40 \\, \\text{Rs}\n\\]\n\nWith the remaining Rs 40, the man can buy shirts at Rs 30 each. Dividing the remaining amount by the cost of one shirt gives:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{40}{30} \\approx 1.33\n\\]\n\nSince the man cannot buy a fraction of a shirt, he can purchase 1 shirt. Thus, the number of shirts is 1.\n\nThe ratio of trousers to shirts is therefore:\n\n\\[\n11 : 1\n\\]\n\nAmong the options provided, the number of trousers corresponding to this ratio is 11.

Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked. \n\nThe question is: A man spends 810 rupees buying trousers at Rs 70 each and shirts at Rs 30 each. What will be the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased?\n\nHmm, so the goal is to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys as many trousers as possible within the 810 rupees. \n\nAlright, let's break this down. The man buys two things: trousers and shirts. The cost of each trouser is 70 Rs, and each shirt is 30 Rs. He spends a total of 810 Rs. \n\nThe problem is asking for the maximum number of trousers he can buy, and then find the ratio of trousers to shirts in that scenario. \n\nSo, I think the first step is to figure out how many trousers he can buy with 810 Rs, and then see how much money is left for shirts. \n\nLet me think. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S. The total cost equation would be:\n\n70*T + 30*S = 810\n\nWe need to maximize T. So, we should find the largest possible integer value of T such that the remaining money can be spent on shirts (i.e., 30*S must be a multiple of 30, which it will be as long as S is an integer).\n\nSo, to maximize T, let's see how much 810 divided by 70 is. \n\nCalculating 810 /70. Let me see, 70 times 11 is 770, which is 70*11=770. 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So the maximum T can be 11, but wait, because 11*70 is 770, and 810-770=40. But 40 isn't a multiple of 30. So he can't buy any shirts with that. So that's a problem because he's not using the entire amount. Or wait, maybe he doesn't have to spend all of it? No, the problem says he spends 810, so he must spend exactly 810. \n\nSo, if T=11, then 70*11=770. 810-770=40. He can't buy shirts with 40 because each shirt is 30. So 40 isn't enough for even one shirt. So that's not possible. So T can't be 11 because then he can't buy any shirts, but perhaps the problem allows for buying zero shirts? Wait, but the problem says he buys both, right? Because he's buying trousers and shirts. So the number of shirts must be at least 1.\n\nWait, no, the question doesn't explicitly say he buys both. It says he buys trousers and shirts, but perhaps he could buy zero shirts if that allows maximum trousers. Hmm, but the problem is about the ratio of trouser to shirt when maximum is purchased. If he buys zero shirts, the ratio would be undefined (division by zero). So maybe that's not the case. So T must be such that the remaining amount after buying T trousers is divisible by 30.\n\nSo, let's find T such that (810 -70*T) is divisible by 30.\n\nSo, 810 -70T must be divisible by 30.\n\nLet me represent that as:\n\n810 -70T \u2261 0 mod 30\n\nSimplify this equation. \n\nFirst, 810 mod 30 is 0, because 30*27=810.\n\n70 mod 30 is 10, because 30*2=60, 70-60=10.\n\nSo, 70T mod 30 is (10T) mod 30.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n0 -10T \u2261 0 mod 30 \u2192 -10T \u2261 0 mod 30 \u2192 10T \u2261 0 mod 30.\n\nWhich simplifies to T \u2261 0 mod 3. Because 10T must be a multiple of 30, so T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo T must be a multiple of 3. So possible T values are 3,6,9, etc.\n\nBut we want the maximum T possible. So let's find the maximum T that is \u2264 810/70.\n\nAs before, 70*11=770, which is less than 810. So T can be up to 11, but since T must be a multiple of 3, let's see the largest multiple of 3 less than or equal to 11.\n\nThe multiples of 3 are 3,6,9,12, etc. But 12*70=840>810, so maximum possible T is 9.\n\nWait, 9 is 9*70=630. Then, 810-630=180. 180/30=6 shirts. So that's possible.\n\nSo T=9, S=6. So the ratio is 9:6, which can be simplified to 3:2.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if there's a higher T possible. Because 9 is a multiple of 3, but what about 10? 10 is not a multiple of 3. Let's see, if T=10, 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 isn't divisible by 30. 30*3=90, 30*4=120. 110-90=20, so 110 isn't a multiple of 30. So T=10 is not possible because 110 can't be divided by 30. \n\nWhat about T=11? As we saw earlier, 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40 isn't divisible by 30. So that's no good.\n\nWhat about T=8? 8 is not a multiple of 3. Let's see: 70*8=560. 810-560=250. 250/30 is 8.333... which isn't an integer. So T=8 is not possible.\n\nT=7: 70*7=490. 810-490=320. 320/30=10.666... Not integer. So no.\n\nT=6: 70*6=420. 810-420=390. 390/30=13. So S=13. So the ratio is 6:13. But since we are looking for maximum T, 9 is better.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9, with S=6. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but the question is about the ratio of trousers to shirts. So 9:6 is the ratio. The options given are A)9 Trousers, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11. So the number of trousers is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, the options are A to E, each giving a number of trousers. So the question is, what is the number of trousers when maximum is bought, which is 9. So the correct option is A)9 Trousers.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about a man who spends 810 rupees buying trousers and shirts. Trousers cost 70 each and shirts 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers possible. The options are given as A to E, each suggesting a different number of trousers.\n\nHmm, so first, I think I should set up an equation. Let's say he buys 't' number of trousers and 's' number of shirts. The total cost would be 70t + 30s = 810. Because he's trying to buy as many trousers as possible, I guess I need to maximize 't'. That makes sense because the question is about the maximum number of trousers.\n\nSo, the equation is 70t + 30s = 810. I can try to rearrange this equation to find possible integer values for 't' and 's'. Since both 't' and 's' have to be whole numbers (you can't buy a fraction of a trouser or shirt), I need to find all possible pairs (t, s) that satisfy the equation, and then pick the one with the largest 't'.\n\nLet me rewrite the equation to express 's' in terms of 't'. Subtract 70t from both sides: 30s = 810 - 70t. Then, divide both sides by 30: s = (810 -70t)/30. Simplify that, maybe. Let's see, 810 divided by 30 is 27. 70 divided by 30 is 7/3. So, s = 27 - (7/3)t.\n\nBut since 's' has to be an integer, (7/3)t must also result in an integer because 27 is an integer. So, (7/3)t should be an integer. That means 't' must be a multiple of 3 because 7 and 3 are coprime (they have no common divisors except 1). So, 't' must be divisible by 3.\n\nWait, that's an important point. So t can be 0, 3, 6, 9, etc., but we can't have t so large that 70t exceeds 810. Let's find the maximum possible 't'. 70t <=810. So t <=810/70. Let me calculate that.\n\n810 divided by 70 is 11.571... So the maximum integer value for 't' is 11. But wait, earlier I thought t has to be a multiple of 3. So the possible maximum 't's would be 3,6,9, but 11 is not a multiple of 3. So the largest 't' possible that's a multiple of 3 and less than or equal to 11 is 9.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me check: If t is 9, then 70*9=630. Then, the remaining money is 810-630=180. 180 divided by 30 is 6. So s would be 6. That's valid.\n\nBut what if t is 10? Let's see. 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110/30 is 3.666... which isn't an integer. So s would be 3.666, which isn't possible.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about a man who spends 810 rupees buying trousers and shirts. Trousers cost 70 each and shirts 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers possible. The options are given as A to E, each suggesting a different number of trousers.\n\nHmm, so first, I think I should set up an equation. Let's say he buys 't' number of trousers and 's' number of shirts. The total cost would be 70t + 30s = 810. Because he's trying to buy as many trousers as possible, I guess I need to maximize 't'. That makes sense because the question is about the maximum number of trousers.\n\nSo, the equation is 70t + 30s = 810. I can try to rearrange this equation to find possible integer values for 't' and 's'. Since both 't' and 's' have to be whole numbers (you can't buy a fraction of a trouser or shirt), I need to find all possible pairs (t, s) that satisfy the equation, and then pick the one with the largest 't'.\n\nLet me rewrite the equation to express 's' in terms of 't'. Subtract 70t from both sides: 30s = 810 - 70t. Then, divide both sides by 30: s = (810 -70t)/30. Simplify that, maybe. Let's see, 810 divided by 30 is 27. 70 divided by 30 is 7/3. So, s = 27 - (7/3)t.\n\nBut since 's' has to be an integer, (7/3)t must also result in an integer because 27 is an integer. So, (7/3)t should be an integer. That means 't' must be a multiple of 3 because 7 and 3 are coprime (they have no common divisors except 1). So, 't' must be divisible by 3.\n\nWait, that's an important point. So t can be 0, 3, 6, 9, etc., but we can't have t so large that 70t exceeds 810. Let's find the maximum possible 't'. 70t <=810. So t <=810/70. Let me calculate that.\n\n810 divided by 70 is 11.571... So the maximum integer value for 't' is 11. But wait, earlier I thought t has to be a multiple of 3. So the possible maximum 't's would be 3,6,9, but 11 is not a multiple of 3. So the largest 't' possible that's a multiple of 3 and less than or equal to 11 is 9.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me check: If t is 9, then 70*9=630. Then, the remaining money is 810-630=180. 180 divided by 30 is 6. So s would be 6. That's valid.\n\nBut what if t is 10? Let's see. 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110/30 is 3.666... which isn't an integer. So s would be 3.666, which isn't possible. So t=10 isn't allowed because s has to be an integer.\n\nSimilarly, t=11 would give 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40/30=1.333... which isn't an integer.

Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe question says: A man spends 810 rupees buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. What will be the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased? The options are A to E, each giving a number of trousers.\n\nHmm, so the goal is to find the maximum number of trousers he can buy without exceeding his budget, and then figure out the ratio of trousers to shirts. Wait, no, wait. The question says \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So I think it's asking for the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts he bought in that scenario.\n\nWait, but maybe I should break it down. Let me think. Let me outline the problem.\n\nHe has a total of 810 rupees. Each trouser costs 70, each shirt 30. He wants to buy as many trousers as possible. So, he'll spend as much as possible on trousers, and whatever money is left will be spent on shirts.\n\nSo, let's denote:\n- Number of trousers as T\n- Number of shirts as S\n\nThe total cost is 70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nWe need to maximize T, so we need to find the maximum possible T such that (810 - 70*T) is non-negative and divisible by 30 (so that S is an integer).\n\nLet me calculate the maximum T possible.\n\nThe maximum T is when he spends all his money on trousers. So 70*T <= 810.\n\nSo T_max = 810 /70. Let me compute that.\n\n810 divided by 70 is approximately 11.57. Since he can't buy a fraction of a trouser, T_max is 11. But wait, 11*70 is 770. Then the remaining money is 810-770=40. But 40 isn't divisible by 30, because 30*1=30, 30*2=60. So 40 can't be used to buy shirts. So he can't buy 11 trousers because he can't spend the remaining 40 on shirts.\n\nSo the next possible T is 10. Let's check.\n\n10*70=700. Remaining money:810-700=110. Now, 110 divided by 30 is 3.666... which is not an integer. So again, he can't buy shirts with 110 because 30*3=90, leaving 20, which isn't enough for another shirt. So 10 also doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me see. The remaining money after buying T trousers must be a multiple of 30.\n\nSo, 810 -70*T must be divisible by 30. Let's express this as:\n\n70*T + 30*S =810\n\nWe can factor this equation. Let's see, both 70 and 30 are divisible by 10. So divide both sides by 10:\n\n7*T +3*S = 81.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to finding the maximum integer T such that 7*T <=81, and (81 -7*T) is divisible by 3.\n\nBecause 3*S must be equal to (81 -7*T). So (81 -7*T) mod 3 must be 0.\n\nAlternatively, 81 mod 3 is 0, since 81 is 27*3. So 7*T mod 3 must equal 0 as well because 81 mod3=0. So 7*T mod3 = (7 mod3)*(T mod3) = 1*(T mod3) = T mod3. So T mod3 must be 0.\n\nWhich means T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo possible T values are 0,3,6,9,12, etc., but considering the maximum T where 7*T <=81.\n\nWait, 7*T <=81 \u2192 T \u2264 81/7 \u224811.57, so T can be up to 11.\n\nSo the possible T values that are multiples of 3 and \u226411 are 9 and 6 and 3 and 0.\n\nWait, wait, 9 is 9*7=63 \u226481. 12 would be 84>81, so no.\n\nSo the maximum T that is a multiple of 3 is 9.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried T=11, 70*11=770, 810-770=40. 40 isn't divisible by 30, so that's not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, T=10: 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110/30 is 3.666, which is not an integer. So T=10 won't work.\n\nSo let's try T=9.\n\n7*9=63. So 81-63=18. 18 is divisible by 3, giving S=6.\n\nSo when T=9, S=6. So the ratio of T:S is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the maximum possible T is 9, and S is 6.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6, which can be reduced by dividing both by 3, giving 3:2. But the options given are all just the number of trousers. Wait, no, looking back, the options are A)9 Trousers, etc. So the question is perhaps not asking for the ratio in terms of numbers, but perhaps the count. Wait, no, the question says \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So the ratio is T:S, which would be 9:6, or 3:2. But the options are only giving numbers for T, not the ratio. So perhaps the question is looking for the number of trousers, which is 9, so option A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me see. Did I make any mistake in calculating?\n\nSo 7*T +3*S=81.\n\nIf T=9, 7*9=63. 81-63=18. 3*S=18 \u2192 S=6.\n\nSo yes, that's correct.\n\nIf I try T=12, 7*12=84>81, which is impossible.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9. So the ratio is 9:6.\n\nBut the options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11.\n\nSo the answer is A)9 Trousers.\n\nWait, but I think I should check other T values in case I missed something.\n\nLet me check T=8. 7*8=56. 81-56=25. 25 isn't divisible by 3. 25/3 is not integer.\n\nT=7: 7*7=49. 81-49=32. 32/3 is not integer.\n\nT=6: 7*6=42. 81-42=39. 39/3=13. So S=13.\n\nSo T=6, S=13. But since we're looking for maximum T, 6 is less than 9, so 9 is better.\n\nT=5: 7*5=35. 81-35=46. 46/3 isn't integer.\n\nT=4: 28. 81-28=53. 53/3 is not integer.\n\nT=3: 21. 81-21=60. 60/3=20. So S=20. But again, T=3 is less than 9.\n\nSo yes, the maximum T is 9, so the answer is option A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe question says: A man spends 810 rupees buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. What will be the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased? The options are A to E, each giving a number of trousers.\n\nHmm, so the goal is to find the maximum number of trousers he can buy without exceeding his budget, and then figure out the ratio of trousers to shirts. Wait, no, wait. The question says \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So I think it's asking for the ratio of the number of trousers to shirts he bought in that scenario.\n\nWait, but maybe I should break it down. Let me think. Let me outline the problem.\n\nHe has a total of 810 rupees. Each trouser costs 70, each shirt 30. He wants to buy as many trousers as possible. So, he'll spend as much as possible on trousers, and whatever money is left will be spent on shirts.\n\nSo, let's denote:\n- Number of trousers as T\n- Number of shirts as S\n\nThe total cost is 70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nWe need to maximize T, so we need to find the maximum possible T such that (810 - 70*T) is non-negative and divisible by 30 (so that S is an integer).\n\nLet me calculate the maximum T possible.\n\nThe maximum T is when he spends all his money on trousers. So 70*T <= 810.\n\nSo T_max = 810 /70. Let me compute that.\n\n810 divided by 70 is approximately 11.57. Since he can't buy a fraction of a trouser, T_max is 11. But wait, 11*70 is 770. Then the remaining money is 810-770=40. But 40 isn't divisible by 30, because 30*1=30, 30*2=60. So 40 can't be used to buy shirts. So he can't buy 11 trousers because he can't spend the remaining 40 on shirts.\n\nSo the next possible T is 10. Let's check.\n\n10*70=700. Remaining money:810-700=110. Now, 110 divided by 30 is 3.666... which is not an integer. So again, he can't buy shirts with 110 because 30*3=90, leaving 20, which isn't enough for another shirt. So 10 also doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me see. The remaining money after buying T trousers must be a multiple of 30.\n\nSo, 810 -70*T must be divisible by 30. Let's express this as:\n\n70*T + 30*S =810\n\nWe can factor this equation. Let's see, both 70 and 30 are divisible by 10. So divide both sides by 10:\n\n7*T +3*S = 81.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to finding the maximum integer T such that 7*T <=81, and (81 -7*T) is divisible by 3.\n\nBecause 3*S must be equal to (81 -7*T). So (81 -7*T) mod 3 must be 0.\n\nAlternatively, 81 mod 3 is 0, since 81 is 27*3. So 7*T mod 3 must equal 0 as well because 81 mod3=0. So 7*T mod3 = (7 mod3)*(T mod3) = 1*(T mod3) = T mod3. So T mod3 must be 0.\n\nWhich means T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo possible T values are 0,3,6,9,12, etc., but considering the maximum T where 7*T <=81.\n\nWait, 7*T <=81 \u2192 T \u2264 81/7 \u224811.57, so T can be up to 11.\n\nSo the possible T values that are multiples of 3 and \u226411 are 9 and 6 and 3 and 0.\n\nWait, wait, 9 is 9*7=63 \u226481. 12 would be 84>81, so no.\n\nSo the maximum T that is a multiple of 3 is 9.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried T=11, 70*11=770, 810-770=40. 40 isn't divisible by 30, so that's not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, T=10: 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110/30 is 3.666, which is not an integer. So T=10 won't work.\n\nSo let's try T=9.\n\n7*9=63. So 81-63=18. 18 is divisible by 3, giving S=6.\n\nSo when T=9, S=6. So the ratio of T:S is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the maximum possible T is 9, and S is 6.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6, which can be reduced by dividing both by 3, giving 3:2. But the options given are all just the number of trousers. Wait, no, looking back, the options are A)9 Trousers, etc. So the question is perhaps not asking for the ratio in terms of numbers, but perhaps the count. Wait, no, the question says \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So the ratio is T:S, which would be 9:6, or 3:2. But the options are only giving numbers for T, not the ratio. So perhaps the question is looking for the number of trousers, which is 9, so option A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me see. Did I make any mistake in calculating?\n\nSo 7*T +3*S=81.\n\nIf T=9, 7*9=63. 81-63=18. 3*S=18 \u2192 S=6.\n\nSo yes, that's correct.\n\nIf I try T=12, 7*12=84>81, which is impossible.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9. So the ratio is 9:6.\n\nBut the options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11.\n\nSo the answer is A)9 Trousers.\n\nWait, but I think I should check other T values in case I missed something.\n\nLet me check T=8. 7*8=56. 81-56=25. 25 isn't divisible by 3. 25/3 is not integer.\n\nT=7: 7*7=49. 81-49=32. 32/3 is not integer.\n\nT=6: 7*6=42. 81-42=39. 39/3=13. So S=13.\n\nSo T=6, S=13. But since we're looking for maximum T, 6 is less than 9, so 9 is better.\n\nT=5: 7*5=35. 81-35=46. 46/3 isn't integer.\n\nT=4: 28. 81-28=53. 53/3 is not integer.\n\nT=3: 21. 81-21=60. 60/3=20. So S=20. But again, T=3 is less than 9.\n\nSo yes, the maximum T is 9, so the answer is option A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of trousers a man can buy with 810 rupees, given that each trouser costs 70 rupees and each shirt costs 30 rupees. The goal is to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased.\n\n### Step 1: Formulate the equation\nThe total cost equation is:\n\\[\n70T + 30S = 810\n\\]\nwhere \\(T\\) is the number of trousers and \\(S\\) is the number of shirts.\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the equation\nDivide the entire equation by 10 to simplify:\n\\[\n7T + 3S = 81\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Maximize \\(T\\)\nTo maximize \\(T\\), we need to find the largest integer \\(T\\) such that:\n1. \\(7T \\leq 81\\)\n2. \\(81 - 7T\\) is divisible by 3 (so \\(S\\) is an integer).\n\nFrom \\(7T \\leq 81\\), the maximum possible \\(T\\) is:\n\\[\nT \\leq \\frac{81}{7} \\approx 11.57\n\\]\nThus, \\(T\\) can be at most 11.

I need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers possible. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should probably set up some variables. Let's say the number of trousers he buys is T, and the number of shirts is S. The total cost would then be 70*T + 30*S = 810. Because he's trying to buy as many trousers as possible, I guess I need to maximize T, while ensuring that S is a whole number because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt.\n\nSo the equation is 70T + 30S = 810. I can simplify this equation to make it easier. Let's divide all terms by 10 to get 7T + 3S = 81. Now, I need to find integer values of T and S that satisfy this equation, with T as large as possible.\n\nHmm, so I can rearrange the equation to solve for S. Let's see: 3S = 81 -7T. So S = (81 -7T)/3. Since S has to be a whole number, (81 -7T) must be divisible by 3. Let me think about how to find T such that this is true.\n\nWait, 7T mod 3 should be equal to 81 mod 3. Because 81 is 27*3, so 81 mod 3 is 0. So 7T mod 3 must also be 0. Let's see what 7 mod 3 is. 7 divided by 3 is 2 with a remainder of 1, so 7 mod 3 is 1. So 7T mod 3 is equal to (1*T) mod 3, which is T mod 3. So T mod 3 must be 0. So T should be a multiple of 3.\n\nWait, does that mean T can be 3, 6, 9, etc.? Let me think. But since he's buying the maximum number of trousers, I should find the largest possible T that doesn't make S negative.\n\nSo starting from the maximum possible T where 70T is less than or equal to 810. 810 /70 is approximately 11.57. So the maximum possible T without considering S is 11. But wait, I have to make sure that when I subtract 70*T from 810, the remaining amount is divisible by 30 (since each shirt is 30).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by finding T such that (810 -70T) is divisible by 30. Let me test T values starting from the highest possible and see which one satisfies the condition.\n\nLet me try T=11 first. 70*11=770. 810-770=40. Now, 40 divided by 30 is 1.333... which is not an integer. So S would be 1.333, which isn't possible. So T=11 isn't valid.\n\nNext, T=10. 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110/30 is 3.666... Again, not an integer. So no.\n\nT=9: 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. That's an integer. So S=6. So T=9 and S=6.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier that T must be a multiple of 3. Let's see, 9 is a multiple of 3. So that's why this works. So the maximum number of trousers is 9, and shirts are 6. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But wait, the question asks for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the ratio is 9:6, which can be reduced to 3:2, but the question might just be looking for the numbers, not the simplified ratio.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A is 9 Trousers. So that must be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check if there are any higher T that work. After T=9, next would be T=10, but that didn't work. T=11 didn't work either. So 9 is the maximum possible. So the ratio is 9 trousers to 6 shirts. The options don't provide the ratio, though; the options just give the number of trousers. Wait, wait the options are labeled A)9 Trousers, etc. So the question is asking what is the number of trousers when maximum is purchased. So the answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nSo the answer should be A.\n",

Subtract 70T from both sides: 30S = 810 -70T. Then divide both sides by 30: S = (810 -70T)/30.\n\nBut S has to be a whole number because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So (810 -70T) must be divisible by 30. Let me think about the divisibility here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can simplify the equation. Let me factor out 10 from all terms. So 10*(7T +3S) = 810. Dividing both sides by 10 gives 7T + 3S = 81. That might be easier to handle.\n\nNow, I need to find integer solutions for T and S such that 7T +3S =81, and T is as large as possible. So, I'll express S in terms of T: 3S =81 -7T \u2192 S=(81-7T)/3. Again, S must be an integer, so (81-7T) must be divisible by 3.\n\nLet me think about the divisibility by 3. 7T mod 3: since 7 mod 3 is 1, 7T mod3 is T mod3. Similarly, 81 mod3 is 0. So (81-7T) mod3 should be 0. So 81-7T \u2261 0 mod3 \u2192 0 - (T mod3) \u22610 \u2192 T mod3 must be 0. So T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nWait, no, because 81 is 0 mod3, and 7T is 7T mod3. 7 mod3 is 1, so 7T mod3 is same as T mod3. So 81-7T \u2261 0 - T mod3 \u2192 0 \u2261 -T mod3 \u2192 T \u22610 mod3. So T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo T can be 0,3,6,9, etc., but we need to find the maximum possible T such that S is non-negative.\n\nWait, but T has to be such that 7T \u226481, because S can't be negative. So maximum T is floor(81/7). Let's calculate that: 7*11 is 77, 7*12 is 84. So 11 is possible because 77 \u226481. So T can be up to 11, but wait, earlier I concluded T must be a multiple of 3. So T can be 3,6,9, but 11 isn't a multiple of 3. Hmm, but wait, let me check. Because the condition is that (81-7T) must be divisible by 3, which led to T being a multiple of 3. So T can only be 3,6,9, etc., but up to the maximum possible.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check T=9: 7*9=63. 81-63=18. 18/3=6 shirts. So S=6. That's valid.\n\nT=12 would be 7*12=84>81, which is not allowed. So the maximum T possible under this condition is 9. But wait, earlier I thought 11 is possible. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier step.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's not assume T must be a multiple of 3. Let me re-examine.\n\nThe equation is 7T +3S=81.\n\nWe can think of S as (81-7T)/3. For S to be integer, (81-7T) must be divisible by 3. Let's see what 7T mod3 is.\n\n7 mod3 is 1, so 7T mod3 is T mod3. So 81 mod3 is 0. So 81-7T mod3 is 0 - T mod3. So for (81-7T) to be divisible by 3, 0 - T mod3 must be 0 \u2192 T mod3=0. So T must be a multiple of 3. So T can be 0,3,6,9,12, etc., but 7T \u226481.\n\nSo T can be 0,3,6,9,12? Let's check T=12: 7*12=84>81, so no. So the maximum T is 9. So when T=9, S= (81-63)/3=18/3=6. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but wait. The problem says \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased\". So if T is maximum at 9, then the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2. But looking at the options, the options are A)9, B)8, etc. Wait, no, the options are options A to E, each with a number of trousers. So perhaps the question is not asking for the ratio but the number of trousers when maximum is bought, but the way the question is phrased, I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, the question says: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So the ratio is T:S. So if T is 9, S is 6, so ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the options don't have a ratio, they have numbers. So perhaps the options are the number of trousers, and the question is to find which option represents the maximum number of trousers. So the maximum number of trousers is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. Let me try T=11. Because 7*11=77, which is less than 81. Then S=(81-77)/3=4/3. But 4/3 is not an integer. So S=1.333... which isn't possible. So T=11 is invalid because S would not be an integer.\n\nWhat about T=10? 7*10=70. 81-70=11. 11/3 is not integer. So S=3.666, no.\n\nT=9: valid, S=6.\n\nT=8: 7*8=56. 81-56=25. 25/3 \u22488.333, no.\n\nT=7: 7*7=49. 81-49=32. 32/3\u224810.666, no.\n\nT=6: 7*6=42. 81-42=39. 39/3=13. So S=13. So T=6, S=13. Ratio 6:13.\n\nBut earlier, T=9 is possible and gives a higher number of trousers. So 9 is the maximum number of trousers possible.\n\nSo the correct answer is 9, which is option A. The ratio is 9:6, but the question is phrased to find the number of trousers when maximum is purchased, so the answer is A)9.\n",

The options given are A to E, each representing a certain number of trousers, but I think the actual ratio is what's needed, not just the number.\n\nHmm, let me break it down. The total amount spent is 810. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S. So, the equation would be 70*T + 30*S = 810.

I need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are A to E, with numbers from 7 to 11 trousers.\n\nHmm, wait. So the main goal is to find the ratio, but the key point is that he buys the maximum number of trousers possible. That makes sense. So he wants to buy as many trousers as he can without exceeding his total budget of 810 rupees.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. I think this is a linear equation problem with two variables. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S.\n\nEach trouser costs 70, so the total cost for trousers is 70T. Each shirt is 30, so shirts cost 30S. The sum of these should equal 810. So the equation is:\n\n70T + 30S = 810.\n\nBut wait, the question says when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So I need to maximize T. How do I do that?\n\nSince I'm trying to buy as many trousers as possible, I should spend as much of the 810 as possible on trousers. But the remaining money can be spent on shirts. But how?\n\nLet me rearrange the equation to express S in terms of T.\n\n30S = 810 -70T\nS = (810 -70T)/30\n\nSimplify that: 810 divided by 30 is 27, and 70 divided by 30 is 7/3. So,\n\nS = (27 - (7/3)T )\n\nBut S has to be a non-negative integer because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt or negative shirts. So (27 - (7/3)T) must be >=0 and an integer.\n\nSo 27 - (7/3)T >=0\nMultiply both sides by 3 to eliminate denominator:\n81 -7T >=0\n7T <=81\nT <= 81/7 \u224811.571\n\nSince T has to be an integer, the maximum T can be is 11, but wait, let me check if 11 is possible.\n\nLet's plug T=11 into the equation for S:\n\nS = (810 -70*11)/30\nCalculate 70*11: 770\n810-770=40\n40/30 = 4/3 \u22481.333. That's not an integer. So S would be 1.333, which isn't possible. So T=11 isn't valid because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt.\n\nSo next, let's try T=10.\n\nS = (810 -70*10)/30\n70*10=700\n810-700=110\n110/30=11/3 \u22483.666. Again, not an integer. So T=10 also doesn't work.\n\nHmm. Let's try T=9.\n\nS=(810-630)/30 \u2192 180/30=6. That's an integer. So with T=9, S=6. That works.\n\nWait, but let's check if maybe a higher T than 9 is possible. Wait, T can be 11, but that gives S=1.333 which isn't allowed. T=10 gives S=3.666. Not allowed.\n\nWhat about T=8?\n\nS=(810-560)/30 \u2192 250/30\u22488.333. Not integer.\n\nT=7: 70*7=490. 810-490=320. 320/30=32/3\u224810.666. Not integer.\n\nSo the maximum T possible is 9, which gives S=6.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Let's check all possible T values from 0 upwards until S becomes fractional.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nWe can model this as 70T +30S =810. We need S to be integer.\n\nAlternatively, 7T +3S = 81 (divided both sides by 10? No, wait 70T+30S=810 \u2192 dividing both sides by 10 gives 7T +3S=81. That's a better equation to work with.)\n\nSo 7T +3S=81.\n\nWe can write this as 3S=81-7T \u2192 S=(81-7T)/3.\n\nWe need S to be a non-negative integer, so (81-7T) must be divisible by 3 and >=0.\n\nSo 81 mod 3 is 0, and 7T mod 3 is (7 mod3)*T mod3 \u2192 1*T mod3.\n\nSo 81-7T \u22610 mod3 \u2192 0 - T \u22610 mod3 \u2192 -T \u22610 mod3 \u2192 T must be 0 mod3.\n\nSo T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo possible T values are 0,3,6,9,12, etc. But T must be <=11 (since 11.57 is the max when T=11.57, but T has to be integer).\n\nSo possible T values: 0,3,6,9,12. But wait, 12 would be 70*12=840, which is more than 810. So T can't be 12. So possible T is 0,3,6,9.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried T=9, S was 6. Let's see:\n\nT=9: 7*9=63 \u2192 81-63=18 \u2192 S=6 \u2192 which is integer. So that's acceptable.\n\nWhat about T=12? 7*12=84 \u2192 81-84= -3 \u2192 S=-1 \u2192 which is invalid. So no.\n\nSo the possible T values are 0,3,6,9.\n\nWait, but 9 is the maximum in that list. So the maximum T is 9, with S=6.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought T=11, but that gives S=40/30 which is 1.333. So that's invalid.\n\nSo the maximum number of trousers is 9, giving 6 shirts.\n\nSo the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question asks for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is bought. The options are about the number of trousers, so the correct answer is 9. So the option is A)9 Trousers.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed any higher T that gives integer S. Let's try T=12 \u2192 no, as before.\n\nWhat about T= 10? 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110/30=11/3, which is not integer. So no.\n\nT=11: 70*11=770. 810-770=40 \u2192 40/30=4/3. Not integer.\n\nT=10.5? No, T must be integer.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9. So the correct option is A)9 Trousers.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here. Let me read it again. A man spends 810 rupees buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. I need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are A to E, with numbers from 7 to 11 trousers.\n\nHmm, wait. So the main goal is to find the ratio, but the key point is that he buys the maximum number of trousers possible. That makes sense. So he wants to buy as many trousers as he can without exceeding his total budget of 810 rupees.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. I think this is a linear equation problem with two variables. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S.\n\nEach trouser costs 70, so the total cost for trousers is 70T. Each shirt is 30, so shirts cost 30S. The sum of these should equal 810. So the equation is:\n\n70T + 30S = 810.\n\nBut wait, the question says when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So I need to maximize T. How do I do that?\n\nSince I'm trying to buy as many trousers as possible, I should spend as much of the 810 as possible on trousers. But the remaining money can be spent on shirts. But how?\n\nLet me rearrange the equation to express S in terms of T.\n\n30S = 810 -70T\nS = (810 -70T)/30\n\nSimplify that: 810 divided by 30 is 27, and 70 divided by 30 is 7/3. So,\n\nS = (27 - (7/3)T )\n\nBut S has to be a non-negative integer because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt or negative shirts. So (27 - (7/3)T) must be >=0 and an integer.\n\nSo 27 - (7/3)T >=0\nMultiply both sides by 3 to eliminate denominator:\n81 -7T >=0\n7T <=81\nT <= 81/7 \u224811.571\n\nSince T has to be an integer, the maximum T can be is 11, but wait, let me check if 11 is possible.\n\nLet's plug T=11 into the equation for S:\n\nS = (810 -70*11)/30\nCalculate 70*11: 770\n810-770=40\n40/30 = 4/3 \u22481.333. That's not an integer. So S would be 1.333, which isn't possible. So T=11 isn't valid because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt.\n\nSo next, let's try T=10.\n\nS = (810 -70*10)/30\n70*10=700\n810-700=110\n110/30=11/3 \u22483.666. Again, not an integer. So T=10 also doesn't work.\n\nHmm. Let's try T=9.\n\nS=(810-630)/30 \u2192 180/30=6. That's an integer. So with T=9, S=6. That works.\n\nWait, but let's check if maybe a higher T than 9 is possible. Wait, T can be 11, but that gives S=1.333 which isn't allowed. T=10 gives S=3.666. Not allowed.\n\nWhat about T=8?\n\nS=(810-560)/30 \u2192 250/30\u22488.333. Not integer.\n\nT=7: 70*7=490. 810-490=320. 320/30=32/3\u224810.666. Not integer.\n\nSo the maximum T possible is 9, which gives S=6.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Let's check all possible T values from 0 upwards until S becomes fractional.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nWe can model this as 70T +30S =810. We need S to be integer.\n\nAlternatively, 7T +3S = 81 (divided both sides by 10? No, wait 70T+30S=810 \u2192 dividing both sides by 10 gives 7T +3S=81. That's a better equation to work with.)\n\nSo 7T +3S=81.\n\nWe can write this as 3S=81-7T \u2192 S=(81-7T)/3.\n\nWe need S to be a non-negative integer, so (81-7T) must be divisible by 3 and >=0.\n\nSo 81 mod 3 is 0, and 7T mod 3 is (7 mod3)*T mod3 \u2192 1*T mod3.\n\nSo 81-7T \u22610 mod3 \u2192 0 - T \u22610 mod3 \u2192 -T \u22610 mod3 \u2192 T must be 0 mod3.\n\nSo T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo possible T values are 0,3,6,9,12, etc. But T must be <=11 (since 11.57 is the max when T=11.57, but T has to be integer).\n\nSo possible T values: 0,3,6,9,12. But wait, 12 would be 70*12=840, which is more than 810. So T can't be 12. So possible T is 0,3,6,9.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried T=9, S was 6. Let's see:\n\nT=9: 7*9=63 \u2192 81-63=18 \u2192 S=6 \u2192 which is integer. So that's acceptable.\n\nWhat about T=12? 7*12=84 \u2192 81-84= -3 \u2192 S=-1 \u2192 which is invalid. So no.\n\nSo the possible T values are 0,3,6,9.\n\nWait, but 9 is the maximum in that list. So the maximum T is 9, with S=6.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought T=11, but that gives S=40/30 which is 1.333. So that's invalid.\n\nSo the maximum number of trousers is 9, giving 6 shirts.\n\nSo the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question asks for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is bought. The options are about the number of trousers, so the correct answer is 9. So the option is A)9 Trousers.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed any higher T that gives integer S. Let's try T=12 \u2192 no, as before.\n\nWhat about T= 10? 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110/30=11/3, which is not integer. So no.\n\nT=11: 70*11=770. 810-770=40 \u2192 40/30=4/3. Not integer.\n\nT=10.5? No, T must be integer.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9. So the correct option is A)9 Trousers.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased within a budget of 810 rupees, given that each trouser costs 70 rupees and each shirt costs 30 rupees. The goal is to maximize the number of trousers while ensuring the total cost does not exceed 810 rupees and that the number of shirts is a non-negative integer.\n\n### Step 1: Set up the equation\nLet \\( T \\) represent the number of trousers and \\( S \\) represent the number of shirts. The total cost equation is:\n\\[\n70T + 30S = 810\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Express \\( S \\) in terms of \\( T \\)\nRearranging the equation to solve for \\( S \\):\n\\[\n30S = 810 - 70T\n\\]\n\\[\nS = \\frac{810 - 70T}{30}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Simplify the equation\nSimplify \\( S \\):\n\\[\nS = \\frac{810}{30} - \\frac{70T}{30}\n\\]\n\\[\nS = 27 - \\frac{7T}{3}\n\\]\n\nFor \\( S \\) to be a non-negative integer, \\( \\frac{7T}{3} \\) must also be an integer, meaning \\( T \\) must be a multiple of 3. Additionally, \\( S \\geq 0 \\), so:\n\\[\n27 - \\frac{7T}{3} \\geq 0\n\\]\n\\[\n81 - 7T \\geq 0\n\\]\n\\[\nT \\leq \\frac{81}{7} \\approx 11.57\n\\]\n\nSince \\( T \\) must be an integer, the possible values for \\( T \\) are 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12. However, \\( T = 12 \\) results in a negative value for \\( S \\), which is invalid. Therefore, the possible values for \\( T \\) are 0, 3, 6, and 9.\n\n### Step 4: Check for the maximum valid \\( T \\)\n- For \\( T = 9 \\):\n  \\[\n  S = 27 - \\frac{7 \\times 9}{3} = 27 - 21 = 6\n  \\]\n  This is valid, as \\( S = 6 \\) is an integer.\n\n- For \\( T = 10 \\) or \\( T = 11 \\), \\( S \\) becomes a non-integer, which is invalid.\n\nThus, the maximum valid \\( T \\) is 9, with \\( S = 6 \\).\n\n### Step 5: Determine the ratio\nThe ratio of trousers to shirts is \\( T:S = 9:6 \\), which simplifies to \\( 3:2 \\). However, the question only asks for the number of trousers when the maximum number is purchased.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe maximum number of trousers that can be purchased is **9**.\n\nAnswer: A",

Trousers cost 70 rupees each, and shirts are 30 rupees each. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are given as A to E with different numbers of trousers.\n\nHmm, I think I need to find out how many trousers and shirts he bought such that the total cost is 810, and the number of trousers is as large as possible. Then, from that, I can find the ratio of trousers to shirts.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. Each trouser is 70, so total cost for trousers is 70*T. Each shirt is 30, so shirts cost 30*S. The total spent is 810, so the equation is:\n\n70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nWe're looking to maximize T. So, I need to find the maximum integer value of T such that when I subtract 70*T from 810, the remaining amount is divisible by 30 (since the remaining is the cost for shirts, and S has to be an integer).\n\nSo, let's rearrange the equation. Let's solve for S:\n\n30*S = 810 - 70*T\nS = (810 -70*T)/30.\n\nS has to be a whole number because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So, (810 -70*T) must be divisible by 30.\n\nLet me think about how to find T. Since 70 and 30 are both multiples of 10, maybe I can simplify the equation by dividing everything by 10. That gives:\n\n7*T + 3*S = 81.\n\nSo now the equation is 7T + 3S = 81. Now, S must be an integer, so 81 -7T must be divisible by 3.\n\nWait, but 7T mod 3 must equal 81 mod 3. Let me compute 81 mod 3: 81 divided by 3 is 27, so remainder 0. So 7T mod 3 must also be 0.\n\nBut 7 mod 3 is 1, because 3*2=6, 7-6=1. So 7T mod 3 is the same as (1*T) mod 3. So for this to be 0, T mod 3 must be 0. So T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo possible values of T are 0,3,6,9, etc. But since we need maximum T, let's see how high T can go without making 70*T exceed 810.\n\nWait, the maximum possible T without considering shirts is when all money is spent on trousers. So maximum T is 810 /70. Let me compute that: 70*11 is 770, which is less than 810. 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So T can't be more than 11. So the maximum possible T is 11, but wait, we have to make sure that (810 -70*T) is divisible by 30.\n\nWait, but earlier I found that T must be a multiple of 3. So possible Ts are 0,3,6,9,12. But 12*70=840>810, so T can't be 12. So possible Ts are 9,6,3,0. But since we're looking for maximum T, let's check T=9 first.\n\nWait, wait, 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180 divided by 30 is 6. So S=6. That's valid. So T=9, S=6.\n\nBut wait, is 9 the maximum possible T? Because 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is about 3.666, which is not an integer. So S can't be 3.666, so T=10 isn't possible.\n\nWhat about T=11? 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40/30 is 1.333... which isn't an integer. So S isn't an integer. So T=11 is invalid.\n\nSo next possible T is 9, which is valid.\n\nWait, but wait, the options given are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Let's see if T=9 is the maximum possible. Let's see what happens if I try T=9. \n\n70*9 = 630. 810 -630 = 180. 180/30=6. So S=6. That's correct.\n\nWhat about T=8? Let's check. 70*8=560. 810-560=250. 250/30 is 8.333... which is not an integer. So S can't be a fraction. So T=8 is invalid.\n\nWhat about T=7? 70*7=490. 810-490=320. 320/30=10.666... Not integer. So no.\n\nT=6: 70*6=420. 810-420=390. 390/30=13. So S=13. But since we're looking for maximum T, 9 is better than 6.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9, which gives S=6. So the ratio is T:S = 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when maximum T is bought. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies, but the options are giving the number of trousers, not the ratio. Wait, wait, the question says \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\"\n\nWait, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again. The options are A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. So the options are giving the number of trousers, not the ratio. But the question says, \"what will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\"\n\nWait, so the answer would be 9 trousers and 6 shirts. So the ratio is 9:6, which can be simplified to 3:2. But the question is asking for the ratio, but the options are giving the number of trousers. Hmm, perhaps I misread the question.\n\nWait, the options are A)9 Trousers, etc. So the options are giving the number of T, not the ratio. So the correct answer is T=9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So maybe the answer is the ratio, but the options are the number of trousers. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, the question says, \"what will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So the ratio is T:S. But the options are giving the number of T only. So perhaps the options are miswritten, or maybe the question is asking for the number of T when maximum T is purchased, which is 9. So the correct option is A)9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are giving the ratio, but looking at the options, they are just numbers with the word 'Trousers' attached. So perhaps the options are giving the number of T's, not the ratio.\n\nSo the answer is A)9 Trousers.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again. A man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. Trousers cost 70 each and shirts are 30 each. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are A to E, with varying numbers of trousers.\n\nHmm, so I think I need to find the maximum number of trousers he can buy without exceeding his total budget of 810 rupees. Once I find that number, I can figure out how many shirts he bought and then find the ratio.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S. Each trouser is 70, so total for trousers is 70T. Each shirt is 30, so total for shirts is 30S. The sum is 70T + 30S = 810.\n\nWe're looking to maximize T, which means we need to minimize S. But S can't be negative, right? So I should find the maximum T such that 70T is less than or equal to 810, and then see if the remaining money can be spent on shirts.\n\nWait, but maybe I should approach it as an equation. Let's write the equation:\n\n70T + 30S = 810\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 10 to make it easier.\n\n7T + 3S = 81.\n\nSo now, 7T + 3S =81. I need to find integer values of T and S that satisfy this equation, with T as large as possible.\n\nLet me think: I can rearrange this equation to express S in terms of T.\n\n3S = 81 -7T  \nS = (81 -7T)/3  \nS = 27 - (7T)/3\n\nSince S must be a whole number, (7T) must be divisible by 3. Because 7 and 3 are coprime (they have no common factors except 1), T must be a multiple of 3. So T can be 3,6,9,... but wait, let me check.\n\nWait, let me think again. 7T must be divisible by 3. Since 7 isn't a multiple of 3, T must be a multiple of 3 to make 7T a multiple of 3. Because 3 divides 7T only if 3 divides T. Because 7 and 3 are coprime.\n\nSo T must be a multiple of 3. So possible Ts are 3,6,9,... but we also have to make sure that S is non-negative.\n\nLet me find the maximum possible T. Let's find T_max where 70T <=810.\n\n810 /70 is approximately 11.57. So the maximum integer T can be 11. But wait, earlier we said T must be a multiple of 3. So the largest possible T that's a multiple of 3 and <=11 is 9, because 9 is 3*3, 12 is 12 which is beyond 11.57, so no. So the maximum T is 9.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check. If T is 9, then 7T=63. So S would be (81 -63)/3 =18/3=6. So S=6. So that's possible.\n\nBut wait, maybe T can be higher? Because 11 is more than 9. But 11 is not a multiple of 3. So let's see if T=11 is possible.\n\nWait, if T=11, then 7*11=77. 81-77=4. Then S=4/3, which is about 1.333, which isn't an integer. So S can't be a fraction. So T=11 is not possible because it would require 4/3 shirts, which isn't allowed.\n\nSo the next possible T is 9, which gives S=6.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a T between 9 and 11 that's a multiple of 3. No, because 9 is the next multiple below 11.57. So T can be 9, 6, 3, etc.\n\nBut let me check if T=10 is possible. Wait, no, because 10 isn't a multiple of 3. Let's see: If T=10, then 7*10=70. 81-70=11. So 11 divided by 3 is 3.666, which isn't an integer. So S would be 3.666, which isn't possible.\n\nSimilarly, T=8: 7*8=56. 81-56=25. 25/3 is about 8.333, which is not integer.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Instead of assuming T must be a multiple of 3, perhaps I can find all possible integer T and S that satisfy the equation, and then pick the maximum T.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model it as 70T +30S=810.\n\nLet me try to find T and S such that 70T +30S=810.\n\nI can simplify this equation by dividing by 10: 7T +3S =81.\n\nWe can write this as 3S=81-7T. So S=(81-7T)/3.\n\nSince S has to be a non-negative integer, 81-7T must be divisible by 3 and >=0.\n\nSo 81 mod3 is 0, so 7T mod3 must be 0. Because 81-7T must be divisible by 3.\n\n7 mod3 is 1, so 7T mod3 is (1*T) mod3. So 1*T mod3 must be 0. So T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo T can be 0,3,6,9,12,... but given that 70T can't exceed 810, let's find maximum T.\n\nMaximum T possible: 810/70 =11.57, so T_max is 11.\n\nBut since T must be a multiple of 3, the possible Ts are 3,6,9.\n\nWait, but wait, 3*3=9 is 9. Next is 12, which is 12*70=840, which is more than 810, so not possible.\n\nSo possible Ts are 0,3,6,9.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9.\n\nSo when T=9, 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180 divided by 30 is 6. So S=6.\n\nSo the ratio of T:S is 9:6. Simplify that, divide by 3: 3:2.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2. But the options don't seem to show ratios; they show the number of trousers. Wait, looking back at the options, the options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11. So the options are the number of trousers, not the ratio. Oh wait, the question says \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\"\n\nWait, wait, the question says: What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\n\nAh, so the ratio is T:S, and the options are the number of trousers. So in this case, T is 9, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure there's no higher T possible. Let me check T=10. If T=10, then 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666... which is not an integer. So S=3.666 is not possible.\n\nT=11: 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40/30=1.333, which isn't an integer. So S=1.333 invalid.\n\nT=12: 70*12=840>810, invalid.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9, which gives S=6. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nBut the question is asking for the ratio, but the options are just the number of trousers. Wait, no. Let me read the options again.\n\nWait, the options are labeled A to E with numbers of trousers: A)9, B)8, etc. So the question is asking, when he buys the maximum number of trousers, what is the ratio. But the options don't list ratios, they list the number of trousers. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, the question says, \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So the ratio is T:S, but the options are the number of T. That can't be right. Oh wait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. Let me read again.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are not the ratio but the possible numbers of trousers. So the question is asking, what is the number of trousers when maximum is purchased, and the options are the number of T. So the correct answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. The problem says \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So the ratio would be T:S, but the options are the count of T. So perhaps the question is actually asking for the number of trousers, not the ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me look again. The question says, \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So the ratio is T:S. But the options are numbers, not ratios. So perhaps the options are the possible T values, and the question is asking for the number of T when maximum is bought. Because the options are A)9, etc.\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake earlier. The question is not about the ratio but the number of trousers when maximum is bought. So the answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but why does the question mention the ratio? Oh, perhaps the ratio is required, but the options are only the number of trousers. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question is, when he buys as many trousers as possible, what's the ratio of T:S.\n\nBut the options are the number of T. So perhaps the options are the possible values of T, and the correct answer is 9, so option A.\n\nSo the answer is option A)9.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question says a man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. Trousers are 70 each and shirts are 30 each. I need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are given from A to E, each with a number of trousers.\n\nWait, okay, so the goal is to maximize the number of trousers he buys. That means I need to see how many trousers he can buy with 810 rupees without exceeding the total. Then, whatever money is left should be spent on shirts. So, it's like a maximization problem with the constraint of the total amount.\n\nLet me denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S. So, the cost equation would be 70*T + 30*S = 810. I need to maximize T, so I should find the maximum integer value of T such that the remaining money can be exactly divided by the price of a shirt, which is 30.\n\nSo, the approach is: find the maximum T where 810 - 70*T is divisible by 30 and results in a non-negative integer S.\n\nLet me think about how to calculate this. Let's rearrange the equation. 30*S = 810 -70*T. So, 810 -70*T must be a multiple of 30. Also, 810 -70*T should be >=0 because S can't be negative.\n\nSo, 70*T <= 810. Let's compute 810 /70. 70*11 is 770, which is less than 810. 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So the maximum possible T can't be more than 11. Wait, but let's check for each option if it's possible.\n\nLooking at the options, the highest option is E) 11 Trousers. Let me check if T=11 works. Then 70*11 = 770. Remaining money is 810-770=40. Now, 40 divided by 30 is 1.333..., which isn't an integer. So S would be 1.333, which isn't possible. So T=11 isn't feasible because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt.\n\nSo the next option is D)7. Wait, no, wait. The options are A to E, but the options are labeled with the number of trousers. So let me list them again: A is 9, B is8, C is10, D is7, E is11.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11.\n\nWait, so the correct way is to find the maximum T where 70*T <=810, and (810-70*T) must be divisible by 30.\n\nLet me compute 810 divided by 70. 70*11 is 770, as I said before. 810-770 is 40, which isn't divisible by 30. So T=11 is not possible.\n\nNext, T=10. 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666... So again, not an integer. So T=10 isn't possible.\n\nNext, T=9. 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. That's an integer. So S=6. So that works. So T=9 and S=6 is a possible solution.\n\nWait, but is 9 the maximum possible T? Because when I tried T=11 and T=10, it didn't work. So 9 is the maximum T that allows S to be an integer.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check T=8. 70*8=560. 810-560=250. 250/30 is 8.333... which isn't an integer. So no.\n\nT=7: 70*7=490. 810-490=320. 320/30 is about 10.666... again, not integer.\n\nWait, so T=9 is the maximum where (810-70*T) is divisible by 30. So the ratio of T:S is 9:6. Simplify that, which is 3:2.\n\nBut the question is asking for the ratio when maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the number of trousers is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me check if any higher T than 9 is possible. So after 9, next is 10, which gave 110, which isn't divisible by 30. 110 divided by 30 is 3 with a remainder of 20. So no, that doesn't work.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9, which gives S=6. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question is about the ratio of trousers to shirts, so it's 9:6 or 3:2. But the options don't give ratios, they give the number of trousers. The question says, \"what will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" Wait, the question might be a bit ambiguous. Wait, maybe the ratio is being asked, but the options are the number of trousers. Hmm, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, but looking at the options, it's the number of trousers. So perhaps the question is asking for the number of trousers when maximum is bought, not the ratio.\n\nWait, the question says, \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So perhaps the ratio is T:S, but the options are the number of T, not the ratio. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, looking at the options again, the options are the number of trousers, such as A)9 Trousers, etc. So the question might be asking for the number of trousers when the maximum possible is bought, not the ratio. So that would make more sense given the options. So the answer would be 9, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, let me go back. The question says, \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So maybe it's asking for the ratio of T:S, but the options are numbers. Alternatively, perhaps the options are the number of T, so the answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but the problem statement is a bit unclear. If the question is about the ratio, and the options are the number of T, that's a problem. But perhaps the question is asking for the number of T when maximum is bought, so the answer is 9, option A.\n\nSo I think the correct answer is A)9 Trousers.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question says a man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. Trousers are 70 each and shirts are 30 each. I need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are given from A to E, each with a number of trousers.\n\nWait, okay, so the goal is to maximize the number of trousers he buys. That means I need to see how many trousers he can buy with 810 rupees without exceeding the total. Then, whatever money is left should be spent on shirts. So, it's like a maximization problem with the constraint of the total amount.\n\nLet me denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S. So, the cost equation would be 70*T + 30*S = 810. I need to maximize T, so I should find the maximum integer value of T such that the remaining money can be exactly divided by the price of a shirt, which is 30.\n\nSo, the approach is: find the maximum T where 810 - 70*T is divisible by 30 and results in a non-negative integer S.\n\nLet me think about how to calculate this. Let's rearrange the equation. 30*S = 810 -70*T. So, 810 -70*T must be a multiple of 30. Also, 810 -70*T should be >=0 because S can't be negative.\n\nSo, 70*T <= 810. Let's compute 810 /70. 70*11 is 770, which is less than 810. 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So the maximum possible T can't be more than 11. Wait, but let's check for each option if it's possible.\n\nLooking at the options, the highest option is E) 11 Trousers. Let me check if T=11 works. Then 70*11 = 770. Remaining money is 810-770=40. Now, 40 divided by 30 is 1.333..., which isn't an integer. So S would be 1.333, which isn't possible. So T=11 isn't feasible because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt.\n\nSo the next option is D)7. Wait, no, wait. The options are A to E, but the options are labeled with the number of trousers. So let me list them again: A is 9, B is8, C is10, D is7, E is11.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11.\n\nWait, so the correct way is to find the maximum T where 70*T <=810, and (810-70*T) must be divisible by 30.\n\nLet me compute 810 divided by 70. 70*11 is 770, as I said before. 810-770 is 40, which isn't divisible by 30. So T=11 is not possible.\n\nNext, T=10. 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666... So again, not an integer. So T=10 isn't possible.\n\nNext, T=9. 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. That's an integer. So S=6. So that works. So T=9 and S=6 is a possible solution.\n\nWait, but is 9 the maximum possible T? Because when I tried T=11 and T=10, it didn't work. So 9 is the maximum T that allows S to be an integer.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check T=8. 70*8=560. 810-560=250. 250/30 is 8.333... which isn't an integer. So no.\n\nT=7: 70*7=490. 810-490=320. 320/30 is about 10.666... again, not integer.\n\nWait, so T=9 is the maximum where (810-70*T) is divisible by 30. So the ratio of T:S is 9:6. Simplify that, which is 3:2.\n\nBut the question is asking for the ratio when maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the number of trousers is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me check if any higher T than 9 is possible. So after 9, next is 10, which gave 110, which isn't divisible by 30. 110 divided by 30 is 3 with a remainder of 20. So no, that doesn't work.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9, which gives S=6. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question is about the ratio of trousers to shirts, so it's 9:6 or 3:2. But the options don't give ratios, they give the number of trousers.

The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. Hmm, I think I need to figure out how many of each he bought to maximize the number of trousers without exceeding his budget.\n\nLet me break it down. The total amount spent is 810. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S. Each trouser is 70, so the cost for trousers is 70*T. Each shirt is 30, so shirts cost 30*S. The total should add up to 810, so the equation is 70T + 30S = 810.\n\nBut wait, the question wants the maximum number of trousers. So I need to maximize T. That makes sense. To do that, I should find the largest integer T such that when multiplied by 70, the remaining money can be spent on shirts, which cost 30 each.\n\nSo, rearranging the equation: 30S = 810 - 70T. Then S = (810 -70T)/30. Since S has to be a whole number (can't buy a fraction of a shirt), (810 -70T) must be divisible by 30.\n\nLet me think about this. Let's simplify the equation. Divide numerator and denominator by 10: (81 -7T)/3. So S must be an integer, meaning 81 -7T must be divisible by 3. Let me see, 81 is divisible by 3 because 8+1=9, which is divisible by 3. So 7T must also leave a remainder that when subtracted from 81, the result is divisible by 3.\n\nWait, another approach: 70T +30S =810. I can factor out 10: 10*(7T +3S) = 810 \u2192 7T +3S =81. So 7T +3S=81.\n\nWe need to find integer values of T and S where T is as large as possible. So let's solve for S: 3S =81-7T \u2192 S=(81-7T)/3.\n\nSince S must be a non-negative integer, (81 -7T) must be non-negative and divisible by 3.\n\nSo 81-7T \u2265 0 \u2192 7T \u226481 \u2192 T \u2264 81/7. Calculating that: 7*11=77, 7*12=84. 81/7 is approximately 11.57. So T can be up to 11, but let's check if 11 is possible.\n\nWait, let's test T=11. Then S=(81 -7*11)/3 \u2192 81-77=4 \u2192 4/3 is not an integer. So T=11 isn't possible because S would be 4/3, which isn't allowed.\n\nNext, try T=10. S=(81-70)/3 \u2192 11/3 \u22483.666. Not an integer either. So T=10 isn't valid.\n\nNext, T=9. S=(81-63)/3=18/3=6. Oh, that's an integer. So T=9, S=6 is possible. So the man buys 9 trousers and 6 shirts.\n\nWait, but is there a higher T than 9 that works? Let me check T=8. S=(81-56)/3=25/3\u22488.333. Not integer. T=7: 7*7=49. 81-49=32. 32/3 is about 10.666. Not integer. T=6: 42. 81-42=39 \u219239/3=13. So T=6, S=13. But wait, but we are trying to maximize T, so the maximum T is 9.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought T could be up to 11.57, but 11 didn't work. So the next lower T is 9, which works. So the maximum number of trousers is 9.\n\nWait, but let me check T=9: 9*70=630. 810-630=180. 180 divided by 30 is 6. So 6 shirts. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6. Simplifying that by dividing both by 3 gives 3:2. But the question is about the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but the options are about the number of trousers. Looking at the options: A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. So the question is, what is the ratio of trousers to shirts? Or is the question about how many trousers were bought? Wait, re-reading the question: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So the ratio of Trousers to shirts.\n\nBut the options are only giving the number of trousers. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me read again.\n\nWait, the options are A)9 Trousers, etc. So the options are giving the number of trousers, but the question is about the ratio. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the question.\n\nAh, perhaps the question is asking for the number of trousers, not the ratio. Because the options are all about the number, like 9, 8, etc. So maybe I misread the question. Let me check again.\n\nQuestion: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\"\n\nWait, that's a bit ambiguous. The ratio could be 9:6, which is 3:2. But the options are all numbers of trousers. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of trousers when the maximum is bought, which is 9. So the correct option would be A)9 Trousers.\n\nWait, but the initial analysis said that the maximum T is 9, which is option A. So the answer would be A.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should double-check. Are there any higher T that could work? Let me check T=9, as before: yes, 9*70=630, 810-630=180. 180/30=6 shirts. So that's correct.\n\nWhat about T=10: 10*70=700. 810-700=110. 110/30=3.666... which is not an integer. So not allowed.\n\nT=11: 770. 810-770=40. 40/30 is 1.333...

So 7T +3S=81.\n\nWe need to find integer values of T and S where T is as large as possible. So let's solve for S: 3S =81-7T \u2192 S=(81-7T)/3.\n\nSince S must be a non-negative integer, (81 -7T) must be non-negative and divisible by 3.\n\nSo 81-7T \u2265 0 \u2192 7T \u226481 \u2192 T \u2264 81/7. Calculating that: 7*11=77, 7*12=84. 81/7 is approximately 11.57. So T can be up to 11, but let's check if 11 is possible.\n\nWait, let's test T=11. Then S=(81 -7*11)/3 \u2192 81-77=4 \u2192 4/3 is not an integer. So T=11 isn't possible because S would be 4/3, which isn't allowed.\n\nNext, try T=10. S=(81-70)/3 \u2192 11/3 \u22483.666. Not an integer either. So T=10 isn't valid.\n\nNext, T=9. S=(81-63)/3=18/3=6. Oh, that's an integer. So T=9, S=6 is possible. So the man buys 9 trousers and 6 shirts.\n\nWait, but is there a higher T than 9 that works? Let me check T=8. S=(81-56)/3=25/3\u22488.333. Not integer. T=7: 7*7=49. 81-49=32. 32/3 is about 10.666. Not integer. T=6: 42. 81-42=39 \u219239/3=13. So T=6, S=13. But wait, but we are trying to maximize T, so the maximum T is 9.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought T could be up to 11.57, but 11 didn't work. So the next lower T is 9, which works. So the maximum number of trousers is 9.\n\nWait, but let me check T=9: 9*70=630. 810-630=180. 180 divided by 30 is 6. So 6 shirts. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6. Simplifying that by dividing both by 3 gives 3:2. But the question is about the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but the options are about the number of trousers. Looking at the options: A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. So the question is, what is the ratio of trousers to shirts? Or is the question about how many trousers were bought? Wait, re-reading the question: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So the ratio of Trousers to shirts.\n\nBut the options are only giving the number of trousers. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me read again.\n\nWait, the options are A)9 Trousers, etc. So the options are giving the number of trousers, but the question is about the ratio. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the question.\n\nAh, perhaps the question is asking for the number of trousers, not the ratio. Because the options are all about the number, like 9, 8, etc. So maybe I misread the question. Let me check again.\n\nQuestion: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\"\n\nWait, that's a bit ambiguous. The ratio could be 9:6, which is 3:2. But the options are all numbers of trousers. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of trousers when the maximum is bought, which is 9. So the correct option would be A)9 Trousers.\n\nWait, but the initial analysis said that the maximum T is 9, which is option A. So the answer would be A.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should double-check. Are there any higher T that could work? Let me check T=9, as before: yes, 9*70=630, 810-630=180. 180/30=6 shirts. So that's correct.\n\nWhat about T=10: 10*70=700. 810-700=110. 110/30=3.666... which is not an integer. So not allowed.\n\nT=11: 770. 810-770=40. 40/30 is 1.333... Not allowed.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9. So the correct option is A)9 Trousers.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased with 810 rupees, given that each trouser costs 70 rupees and each shirt costs 30 rupees. The total expenditure is represented by the equation:\n\n\\[\n70T + 30S = 810\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(T\\) is the number of trousers and \\(S\\) is the number of shirts. To maximize \\(T\\), we rearrange the equation to solve for \\(S\\):\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{810 - 70T}{30}\n\\]\n\nFor \\(S\\) to be a non-negative integer, \\((810 - 70T)\\) must be divisible by 30. Testing values of \\(T\\) starting from the highest possible value:\n\n1. **For \\(T = 11\\):**  \n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{810 - 70 \\times 11}{30} = \\frac{810 - 770}{30} = \\frac{40}{30} \\approx 1.333\n   \\]  \n   \\(S\\) is not an integer, so \\(T = 11\\) is not valid.\n\n2. **For \\(T = 10\\):**  \n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{810 - 70 \\times 10}{30} = \\frac{810 - 700}{30} = \\frac{110}{30} \\approx 3.666\n   \\]  \n   \\(S\\) is not an integer, so \\(T = 10\\) is not valid.\n\n3. **For \\(T = 9\\):**  \n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{810 - 70 \\times 9}{30} = \\frac{810 - 630}{30} = \\frac{180}{30} = 6\n   \\]  \n   \\(S = 6\\) is an integer, so \\(T = 9\\) is valid.\n\n4. **For \\(T = 8\\):**  \n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{810 - 70 \\times 8}{30} = \\frac{810 - 560}{30} = \\frac{250}{30} \\approx 8.333\n   \\]  \n   \\(S\\) is not an integer, so \\(T = 8\\) is not valid.\n\n5. **For \\(T = 7\\):**  \n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{810 - 70 \\times 7}{30} = \\frac{810 - 490}{30} = \\frac{320}{30} \\approx 10.666\n   \\]  \n   \\(S\\) is not an integer, so \\(T = 7\\) is not valid.\n\nThe maximum valid value of \\(T\\) is 9, with \\(S = 6\\). Therefore, the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased is **9**.\n\nAnswer: A",
