      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a factory producing staplers. Hmm, let me read it again.\n\nThe question says that 10% of the staplers produced on Monday were defective. Then, 2% of the non-defective ones were rejected by mistake. And they tell me that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected. I need to find the total number of staplers produced that day. The options are A)4000, B)4200, C)4500, D)4800, E)5000.\n\nAlright, let me break this down. First, let's denote the total number of staplers produced as N. Since 10% are defective, that means 90% are non-defective. So, the number of non-defective staplers is 0.9 * N.\n\nNow, of these non-defective staplers, 2% were mistakenly rejected. They said that this number equals 72. So, 2% of the non-defective is 72. Let me write that as an equation.\n\nSo, 2% of 0.9N equals 72. Mathematically, that's 0.02 * 0.9N =72.\n\nLet me compute that. 0.02 times 0.9 is 0.018. So, 0.018*N =72.\n\nTo find N, I can divide both sides by 0.018. So N equals 72 divided by 0.018.\n\nHmm, what's 72 divided by 0.018? Let me calculate. 0.018 times 4000 is 72, because 0.018 * 4000 = 72. So N is 4000. Wait, but let me check that again.\n\nWait, 0.018 times 4000 is 72? Let me compute 4000 *0.018. 4000 *0.01 is 40, and 4000*0.008 is 32. So 40 +32=72. Yes, that's correct. So N is 4000.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The options include 4000 as option A. So the answer should be A)4000.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Did I model this correctly?\n\nTotal produced: N.\n\nDefectives: 10% of N, so 0.1N.\n\nNon-defectives: 0.9N.\n\nRejected non-defectives: 2% of 0.9N, which is 0.02 *0.9N =0.018N.\n\nSet that equal to 72: 0.018N=72.\n\nSo N=72/0.018=4000. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because 4000 is the first option, but sometimes these problems can have a twist. Let me check my steps.\n\nAnother way: Let me plug the number back in. If N is 4000, then non-defectives are 0.9*4000=3600. 2% of 3600 is 72. Yes, that matches the given condition. So N=4000.\n\nSo the answer should be A)4000. But wait, the options have A as 4000, which is what I got. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but why am I doubting? Maybe I should think if I made any mistake in calculations. 0.02 * 0.9 is 0.018, right? Yes. 72 divided by 0.018 is indeed 4000. So yeah, I think I'm confident now.\n",

So, if the total number of staplers is, say, N, then 10% of N are defective. That means 90% are non-defective because 100% minus 10% is 90%. So non-defective = 0.9 * N.\n\nBut then there's another part. It says that 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. So from the non-defective group, 2% got rejected. And the problem states that 72 of these non-defective ones were rejected. So I can set up an equation here.\n\nWait, the number of non-defective is 0.9N, right? And 2% of that is rejected, which equals 72. So mathematically, that's 0.02 * 0.9N = 72.\n\nLet me write that down: 0.02 * 0.9N =72. Hmm, let me compute 0.02 times 0.9. 0.02 * 0.9 is 0.018. So 0.018 * N =72.\n\nTo find N, I can divide both sides by 0.018. So N =72 / 0.018. Let me do that division. Hmm, 72 divided by 0.018. Let me think: 0.018 goes into 72 how many times?\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to convert 0.018 into a fraction. 0.018 is the same as 18/1000, which simplifies to 9/500. So 72 divided by (9/500) is the same as 72 * (500/9). Let me compute that.\n\n72 divided by 9 is 8. So 8 *500 is 4000. Oh, wait, so N is 4000? Let me check the options. Option A is 4,000.

Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe problem says: At a certain factory, 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective. Then, 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. And we're told that 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected. The question is, how many staplers were produced that day?\n\nHmm. Alright, let's break this down. So, the factory makes a certain number of staplers. Let's call the total number produced N. \n\nFirst, 10% of these are defective. So, the number of defective staplers is 10% of N, which is 0.10 * N. That means the non-defective staplers would be the total minus the defective ones. So, non-defective = N - 0.10N = 0.90N. \n\nNow, of these non-defective staplers, 2% were mistakenly rejected. So, the number of non-defective ones that got rejected is 2% of 0.90N. Which is 0.02 * 0.90N. And according to the problem, this number equals 72. \n\nWait, let me write that down as an equation. So:\n\n0.02 * (0.90N) = 72.\n\nThat's the key equation here. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, multiply 0.02 and 0.90. 0.02 * 0.90 is 0.018. So the equation becomes 0.018 * N = 72.\n\nSo, to find N, I can divide both sides by 0.018. Let's compute that: N = 72 / 0.018.\n\nHmm, what's 72 divided by 0.018? Let me think. Maybe I can convert that into fractions. 0.018 is the same as 18/1000, which simplifies to 9/500. So, 72 divided by (9/500) is the same as 72 * (500/9). \n\nLet me compute that. 72 divided by 9 is 8. So, 8 * 500 is 4000. Wait, that would give me N = 4000. \n\nBut wait, looking at the options, 4000 is option A. But wait, let me double-check because sometimes I might miscalculate.\n\nWait another way: 0.018 * N =72. So N=72 /0.018. Let me compute 72 divided by 0.018. \n\nWell, 72 divided by 0.01 is 7200. But 0.018 is 1.8 times 0.01, so 72 / 0.018 is 7200 / 1.8. Let me compute 7200 / 1.8. \n\n1.8 times 4000 is 7200 (because 1.8 * 4000 = 7200). So yes, 7200 /1.8 is 4000. So N is 4000. \n\nBut wait, let me check the options again. Option A is 4000. So is that the correct answer? Hmm.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in interpreting the problem. The 2% is of the non-defective, which is correct. So 2% of 0.9N is 0.018N, and that equals 72. So yes, N is 72 /0.018=4000.\n\nWait, but I remember sometimes when there are two percentages, it's easy to mix up the order. Let me think again. So 10% defective, so 90% non-defective. Of that 90%, 2% are rejected. So yeah, 0.9 * 0.02 = 0.018. So the 72 is 0.018 of total.\n\nSo N = 72 / 0.018 = 4000. So the answer should be A)4,000.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, 4000 is A, but I think I saw somewhere that the answer was 4800. Hmm, maybe I messed up. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 72 / 0.018 again.\n\n0.018 * 4000 = 72. Let me compute 0.018 *4000. 0.01 *4000 is 40, 0.008*4000 is 32. 40+32=72. So yes, 0.018 *4000=72. So N=4000.\n\nSo the answer should be A)4,000.\n",

Let's call the total number produced N. \n\nFirst, 10% of these are defective. So, the number of defective staplers is 10% of N, which is 0.10 * N.

So, the number of non-defective ones that got rejected is 2% of 0.90N. Which is 0.02 * 0.90N. And according to the problem, this number equals 72. \n\nWait, let me write that down as an equation.

So the equation becomes 0.018 * N = 72.\n\nSo, to find N, I can divide both sides by 0.018. Let's compute that: N = 72 / 0.018.\n\nHmm, what's 72 divided by 0.018? Let me think. Maybe I can convert that into fractions. 0.018 is the same as 18/1000, which simplifies to 9/500. So, 72 divided by (9/500) is the same as 72 * (500/9). \n\nLet me compute that. 72 divided by 9 is 8. So, 8 * 500 is 4000. Wait, that would give me N = 4000. \n\nBut wait, looking at the options, 4000 is option A.

But 0.018 is 1.8 times 0.01, so 72 / 0.018 is 7200 / 1.8. Let me compute 7200 / 1.8. \n\n1.8 times 4000 is 7200 (because 1.8 * 4000 = 7200). So yes, 7200 /1.8 is 4000. So N is 4000. \n\nBut wait, let me check the options again. Option A is 4000. So is that the correct answer? Hmm.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in interpreting the problem. The 2% is of the non-defective, which is correct. So 2% of 0.9N is 0.018N, and that equals 72. So yes, N is 72 /0.018=4000.\n\nWait, but I remember sometimes when there are two percentages, it's easy to mix up the order. Let me think again. So 10% defective, so 90% non-defective. Of that 90%, 2% are rejected. So yeah, 0.9 * 0.02 = 0.018. So the 72 is 0.018 of total.\n\nSo N = 72 / 0.018 = 4000. So the answer should be A)4,000.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, 4000 is A, but I think I saw somewhere that the answer was 4800. Hmm, maybe I messed up. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 72 / 0.018 again.\n\n0.018 * 4000 = 72. Let me compute 0.018 *4000. 0.01 *4000 is 40, 0.008*4000 is 32. 40+32=72. So yes, 0.018 *4000=72. So N=4000.\n\nSo the answer should be A)4,000.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let the total number of staplers produced be \\( N \\). \n\n1. **Defective Staplers**: 10% of the staplers are defective, so the number of defective staplers is \\( 0.10N \\). This means the number of non-defective staplers is \\( N - 0.10N = 0.90N \\).\n\n2. **Rejected Non-Defective Staplers**: 2% of the non-defective staplers are rejected by mistake. Therefore, the number of rejected non-defective staplers is \\( 0.02 \\times 0.90N = 0.018N \\).\n\n3. **Given Information**: It is stated that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected. Thus, \\( 0.018N = 72 \\).\n\n4. **Solve for \\( N \\)**: Rearranging the equation, \\( N = \\frac{72}{0.018} \\). Calculating this gives \\( N = 4000 \\).\n\n5. **Verification**: To ensure accuracy, substitute \\( N = 4000 \\) back into the equation \\( 0.018N \\). \\( 0.018 \\times 4000 = 72 \\), confirming the calculation is correct.\n\nThus, the total number of staplers produced that day is **4,000**.\n\nAnswer: A",

I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it slowly.\n\nThe problem says: 10% of the staplers produced on Monday were defective. So, if the total number of staplers is, say, N, then 10% of N are defective. That means the non-defective ones would be 90% of N, right? Because 100% minus 10% is 90%. So, non-defective = 0.9N.\n\nThen, it says 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. Oh wait, so not all non-defectives are accepted. Some good ones are mistakenly rejected. So, 2% of the non-defective group gets rejected. \n\nThe problem states that 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected. So, this 72 is 2% of the non-defective count. Hmm. So, if 2% equals 72, then I can find the non-defective number first, and then find N.\n\nLet me write this down. Let me denote the total produced as N. So, non-defective = 0.9N. The number of non-defective rejected is 2% of that, which is 0.02 * 0.9N. And this equals 72.\n\nSo, 0.02 * 0.9N = 72. Let me compute that. 0.02 times 0.9 is 0.018. So, 0.018N = 72.\n\nTo find N, I can divide both sides by 0.018. So, N = 72 / 0.018.\n\nWait, what's 72 divided by 0.018? Let me think. 0.018 times 4000 is 72, because 0.018 * 4000 = 72. Because 0.018 * 1000 is 18, so 4000 would be 72. Oh, wait, 18 times 4 is 72. So yes, 0.018 * 4000 is 72. So N is 4000.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Let's see:\n\nIf N is 4000, then 10% are defective. So defective is 400. Non-defective is 4000-400=3600.\n\nThen 2% of 3600 is 72. Because 3600 * 0.02 is 72. So that matches the given data.\n\nHmm, so N is 4000, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me look at the options again. The options are A)4,000, B)4,200, etc. So according to this, the answer is A.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem says 2% of the non-defective were rejected. So non-defective is 90% of N. So 2% of that is 0.02*0.9N=0.018N=72. So N=72 / 0.018=4000. That seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be A)4,000. But wait, sometimes these problems can have tricks. Did I miss anything?

Well, 0.018 is the same as 18/1000, so 72 divided by (18/1000) is 72 * (1000/18). Let me compute 72/18 first. That's 4. So 4 * 1000 is 4000.

So, out of all the staplers made, 10% don't work right, and the rest are good, non-defective. Then, it says that 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. Oh, wait, so even some of the good ones got thrown away because of some error. \n\nAnd the key piece of information is that 72 of these non-defective staplers were rejected. The question is asking how many staplers were produced that day. The options are given, so I need to find which one is the correct total number.\n\nHmm. Let me think about how to model this. Let's denote the total number of staplers produced as N. Since 10% are defective, that means 90% are non-defective. So, the number of non-defective staplers is 0.9 * N.\n\nBut wait, some of these non-defective ones were rejected. The problem states that 2% of the non-defective were rejected, and that number is 72.

Let's see what that gives.\n\nN = 72 / 0.018.\n\nCalculating that... Let me do it step by step. 72 divided by 0.018.\n\nHmm, 0.018 is 18 thousandths. So 72 divided by 0.018 is the same as 72 multiplied by (1000/18). Let's see:\n\n72 * (1000/18) = (72/18) * 1000 = 4 * 1000 = 4000.\n\nWait, so N is 4000?

Did I interpret the percentages correctly? 10% defective, so 90% non-defective. Then, 2% of those non-defective were rejected, leading to 72. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1.

Oh, wait, so even some of the good ones got thrown away because of some error. \n\nAnd the key piece of information is that 72 of these non-defective staplers were rejected. The question is asking how many staplers were produced that day. The options are given, so I need to find which one is the correct total number.\n\nHmm. Let me think about how to model this. Let's denote the total number of staplers produced as N. Since 10% are defective, that means 90% are non-defective. So, the number of non-defective staplers is 0.9 * N.\n\nBut wait, some of these non-defective ones were rejected. The problem states that 2% of the non-defective were rejected, and that number is 72. So, 2% of the non-defective equals 72. \n\nLet me write that down as an equation. 2% of non-defective is 72, so:\n\n0.02 * (number of non-defective) = 72.\n\nBut the number of non-defective is 0.9 * N. So substituting that in:\n\n0.02 * (0.9 * N) = 72.\n\nLet me compute the left side. 0.02 multiplied by 0.9 is 0.018. So,\n\n0.018 * N = 72.\n\nTo find N, I need to divide both sides by 0.018. Let's see what that gives.\n\nN = 72 / 0.018.\n\nCalculating that... Let me do it step by step. 72 divided by 0.018.\n\nHmm, 0.018 is 18 thousandths. So 72 divided by 0.018 is the same as 72 multiplied by (1000/18). Let's see:\n\n72 * (1000/18) = (72/18) * 1000 = 4 * 1000 = 4000.\n\nWait, so N is 4000? Let me check that. 10% of 4000 is 400 defective, so non-defective are 3600. 2% of 3600 is 72. Yeah, that matches the given information.\n\nSo the total number produced is 4000. Looking at the options, option A is 4,000. So the answer should be A.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Did I interpret the percentages correctly? 10% defective, so 90% non-defective. Then, 2% of those non-defective were rejected, leading to 72. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Let N = total staplers.\n2. Non-defective = 0.9 N.\n3. Rejected non-defective = 0.02 * (0.9 N) = 72.\n4. Solve for N: 0.018 N =72 \u2192 N=4000.\n\nYep, that all adds up. So I'm confident the answer is A)4,000.\n\n\nTo determine the total number of staplers produced, let \\( N \\) represent the total number of staplers. According to the problem:\n\n1. **Defective Staplers**: 10% of the staplers are defective, so 90% are non-defective. The number of non-defective staplers is \\( 0.9N \\).\n\n2. **Rejected Non-Defective Staplers**: 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected, and this number is given as 72. This can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   0.02 \\times (0.9N) = 72\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the Equation**:\n   \\[\n   0.018N = 72\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( N \\)**:\n   \\[\n   N = \\frac{72}{0.018} = 4000\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of staplers produced that day is **4,000**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a factory producing staplers. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says that 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective. And then, 2 percent of the non-defective ones were rejected by mistake. Oh, and they told us that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected. We need to find the total number of staplers produced that day. The options are A through E, with numbers ranging from 4,000 to 5,000.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, let's think about the total number of staplers produced. Let's call that number T. So, of these, 10% were defective. That means 90% were non-defective. Because 100% minus 10% is 90%, right?\n\nSo the number of non-defective staplers is 0.9 * T.\n\nNow, of these non-defective staplers, 2% were mistakenly rejected. So the number of rejected non-defective staplers is 2% of the non-defective ones. Which would be 0.02 * (0.9 T). \n\nAnd the problem says that this number equals 72. So, 0.02 * 0.9 T = 72. Let me write that equation out:\n\n0.02 * 0.9 * T = 72.\n\nLet me calculate 0.02 * 0.9 first. 0.02 times 0.9 is 0.018. So 0.018 * T = 72.\n\nTo find T, I need to divide both sides by 0.018. So T = 72 / 0.018.\n\nWait, what's 72 divided by 0.018? Hmm, maybe I can think of it as 72 divided by 1.8% because 0.018 is 1.8%. Or maybe calculate it directly.\n\nLet me compute 72 divided by 0.018. Let me see:\n\n72 / 0.018 = ?\n\nWell, 0.018 is 18/1000, so 72 divided by (18/1000) is 72 * (1000/18). Let's compute that.\n\n72 * (1000 / 18) = (72 / 18) * 1000 = 4 * 1000 = 4000.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 4000 is one of the options. Option A is 4,000. But wait, let me double-check the math because sometimes I make mistakes.\n\nWait, 0.018 times what is 72? Let me try T=4000. 0.9 * 4000 = 3600. 2% of 3600 is 72. Oh, yes, that's correct. So 72 is 2% of 3600, which is the non-defective count when T is 4000.\n\nWait, but wait a second, the options include 4,800 as an option. Hmm, why is that? Did I do something wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says 10% were defective, so 90% non-defective. Then, 2% of the non-defective were rejected, and that equals 72. So the way I set up the equation is correct.\n\nWait, maybe I should write it as 0.02 * (T - 0.1 T) = 72. Because T minus 10% defective gives the non-defective, which is 0.9 T. So that's the same as what I did earlier.\n\nSo, 0.02 * 0.9 T = 72.\n\nWhich simplifies to 0.018 T =72.\n\nT=72 /0.018= 4000.\n\nBut wait, option A is 4000. But looking back at the options, I see that option D is 4800. So why is that?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2% is of the total produced, not the non-defective. No, the question says 2% of the non-defective. So the setup is correct.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of equations again. Let me define variables.\n\nLet me let T = total produced.\n\nDefective = 0.1 T.\n\nNon-defective = T - 0.1 T = 0.9 T.\n\nRejected non-defective = 2% of non-defective = 0.02 * 0.9 T = 0.018 T.\n\nGiven that 0.018 T =72.\n\nSo T=72 /0.018= 4000.\n\nSo the answer would be 4000, which is option A.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me see the options again:\n\nA)4,000\n\nB)4,200\n\nC)4,500\n\nD)4,800\n\nE)5,000\n\nSo the correct answer is A)4,000.\n\nBut wait, I'm confused because I recall sometimes problems like this where you have to consider that some defectives might also be rejected, but the problem states that the 2% is only of the non-defective. So perhaps my initial approach is correct.\n\nWait, but let's do a sanity check. Suppose the total is 4000. 10% defective: 400 defective. Non-defective: 3600. 2% of 3600 is 72. That's exactly the given number. So yes, it adds up. So the correct answer is 4000, which is option A.\n\nHmm, but why is 4800 an option? Maybe I should check if I made a mistake in the equation setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the total number of rejected, but no, the question says 72 of the non-defective were rejected.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the 2% is of the total, but that's not what it says. No, the problem says 2% of the non-defective.\n\nWait, maybe the way I set up the equation is wrong. Let's try again.\n\nLet me think: non-defective is 0.9 T. 2% of that is rejected, which is 0.02 *0.9 T =72.\n\nSo 0.018 T=72.\n\nT=72/0.018=4000.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer is A)4,000.\n\nBut wait, wait another thing. Maybe the rejected includes both defective and non-defective. But the question says 2% of the non-defective were rejected by mistake. So only non-defectives are being rejected at 2%. So the total rejected would be the 72 non-defective plus the defective ones, but the question doesn't give us the total rejected. So the setup is correct.\n\nSo yeah, the correct answer is A)4,000.\n",

Alternatively, I can multiply numerator and denominator by 1000 to eliminate decimals.\n\nSo, 72 * 1000 = 72000, and 0.018 *1000=18. So it's 72000 / 18.\n\nWait, 72000 divided by 18. Let me see. 18 times 4000 is 72,000 because 18*4=72, so 18*4000=72000. So 72000/18 = 4000.\n\nWait, so N is 4000? That would be option A.\n\nWait, let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nTotal staplers: N.\n\nDefective: 10% of N \u2192 0.1N defective.\n\nNon-defective: N - 0.1N = 0.9N.\n\nRejected non-defective: 2% of 0.9N \u2192 0.02 *0.9N=0.018N.\n\nSet equal to 72: 0.018N=72 \u2192 N=72 /0.018=4000.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the total number is 4000, which is option A.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the total number of staplers produced on Monday. Let the total number of staplers be \\( N \\). \n\n1. **Defective and Non-Defective Staplers**:  \n   - 10% of the staplers are defective, so 90% are non-defective.  \n   - Number of non-defective staplers = \\( 0.9N \\).\n\n2. **Rejected Non-Defective Staplers**:  \n   - 2% of the non-defective staplers are rejected by mistake.  \n   - Number of rejected non-defective staplers = \\( 0.02 \\times 0.9N = 0.018N \\).  \n   - It is given that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so:  \n     \\[\n     0.018N = 72\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( N \\)**:  \n   - Divide both sides by 0.018:  \n     \\[\n     N = \\frac{72}{0.018} = 4000\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total number of staplers produced that day is **4,000**.\n\nAnswer: A",
