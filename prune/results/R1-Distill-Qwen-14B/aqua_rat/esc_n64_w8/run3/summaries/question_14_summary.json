Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on adding positive and negative numbers, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nWait, adding positive and negative numbers is like combining them, right? So when you add a positive and a negative, you kind of subtract them. Oh, but wait, which one is bigger?

So that must be the correct answer. But wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check. Another way to look at it is, adding a positive and a negative is like subtracting. So +45 plus (-30) is the same as 45 minus 30, which is indeed 15. Yeah, that's right. So I'm confident the answer is D.\n\n\nTo solve the problem of adding +45 and -30, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers and their signs**:  \n   - The first number is +45 (positive).  \n   - The second number is -30 (negative).\n\n2. **Understand the rule for adding numbers with different signs**:  \n   - When adding a positive and a negative number, subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger one.  \n   - The result will take the sign of the number with the larger absolute value.\n\n3. **Apply the rule**:  \n   - The absolute values are 45 and 30.  \n   - Since 45 > 30, the result will be positive.  \n   - Subtract 30 from 45:  \n     \\[\n     45 - 30 = 15\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the final answer**:  \n   - The result is +15.  \n\n5. **Match with the options**:  \n   - Option D corresponds to +15.  \n\nThus, the correct answer is **D**.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. It says to add +45 and -30. Hmm, I think I remember how to do this. Let me think. When you add positive and negative numbers, it's like subtracting. So maybe I subtract the smaller number from the larger one and keep the sign of the bigger one?\n\nWait, right. So the rule is that if the signs are the same, you add the numbers and keep the sign. But if they're different, you subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger and take the sign of the larger one. So here, +45 and -30. Oh wait, they have different signs. So I should subtract 30 from 45 and then take the sign of the bigger number, which is positive.\n\nSo 45 minus 30 is 15. And since 45 is positive, the result is positive 15. Looking at the options, D is +15. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Another way is to imagine the number line. Starting at +45, if I add -30, I move 30 units to the left. 45 minus 30 is 15. Yep, that makes sense. So yeah, D is correct.\n",
