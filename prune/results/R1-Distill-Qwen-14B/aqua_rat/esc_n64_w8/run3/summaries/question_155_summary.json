      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a room's height and semi-perimeter, and I need to figure out the height. Hmm, let's see. I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says the ratio of the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. I'm a bit confused about what the semi-perimeter refers to here. Wait, the semi-perimeter of a rectangle (which I assume the room is) is (length + breadth)/2. Oh wait, no, wait. The semi-perimeter is usually (length + width) divided by 2. But wait, the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + width), so semi-perimeter would be length + width. Because, for example, if the perimeter is P=2(l + w), then semi-perimeter S = l + w. Oh right, that's right. So the semi-perimeter is the sum of length and width.\n\nSo the ratio is height : semi-perimeter = 2:5. Let me denote height as h and semi-perimeter as S. So h/S = 2/5. That implies that h = (2/5)*S. Or, rearranged, S = (5/2)h.\n\nNext part: It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls. The paper is 50 cm wide, costs Rs.2 per meter. They also mention that 15 square meters are allowed for doors and windows, which I guess are areas not covered by the paper.\n\nSo, the cost calculation. Let me think: The cost is based on the area of paper used. The paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters. The cost per meter is Rs.2. So, the cost depends on the length of paper used. Because the cost per meter of paper is Rs.2, so for each meter length, it's 0.5 m wide (since 50 cm is 0.5m). So, the area of paper used is length * width. But wait, actually, the cost is calculated per meter length of the paper, regardless of width. So, if the paper is 0.5m wide and costs Rs.2 per meter, then the cost per square meter would be different, but I think it's better to think in terms of how much paper is needed in terms of area.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The paper is sold at Rs.2 per meter. Each meter is 1m long and 0.5m wide. So each meter of paper is 0.5 square meters. So, each meter costs Rs.2, so the area cost is Rs.2 per 0.5 m\u00b2, which is Rs.4 per square meter. Hmm, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, the cost is directly proportional to the area used, since the area is (length of paper) * 0.5 m. So, the cost is (length of paper in meters) * 2 Rs/m.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. The total cost is Rs.260. The paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 m. The cost per meter is Rs.2, so the cost per square meter of paper is 2 Rs/m * 0.5 m (width) = 1 Rs per square meter. Because each square meter of paper is 1m x 0.5m, but wait no, that's 0.5 m\u00b2. So perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to calculate how much area of paper is used. The total cost is 260 Rs. The paper is 50 cm wide, so 0.5 m. The price is Rs.2 per meter. So, the area of paper purchased is cost divided by price per square meter. Hmm, but perhaps I should calculate how much paper was used in terms of area, subtract the area for doors and windows, then find the area of the walls.\n\nWait, the problem says the cost is Rs.260 to paper the walls, considering an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. So, the paper covers the walls except for 15 sq.m. So, the area of the walls (excluding doors) is equal to the area of paper used plus the area of doors and windows.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you paper the walls, the area of the paper used is equal to the area of the walls minus the area of the doors and windows. Because the paper is only covering the walls, not the doors. So, the area of paper is (Total wall area) - (15 sq.m).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the paper covers the area of the walls, but they allow 15 sq.m for doors and windows, meaning that the paper used is (wall area) minus 15. But I'm a bit confused about the exact wording.\n\nLet me re-read that part: \"It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows.\"\n\nSo, when you paper the walls, you have to cover the walls, but you subtract the area of the doors and windows, which are not covered. So, the area of the paper used is (Total wall area) - 15.\n\nBut how to compute the total wall area. The wall area is the perimeter of the room multiplied by the height, because each wall is height h and length either l or w. So, the total wall area is 2*(l + w)*h. But that would be the area without subtracting the doors and windows.\n\nWait, but wait, the semi-perimeter S is (l + w). So, the perimeter is 2S. So, the wall area is 2S * h. So, the area of the paper used would be (2S * h) - 15.\n\nBut the paper is 50 cm wide, so when you unroll it, each strip is 0.5 m wide and some length. The cost is Rs.2 per meter. So, for each meter of length, the cost is Rs.2, but the area per meter is 0.5 m\u00b2 (since 0.5m * 1m = 0.5 m\u00b2). So, the area of the paper used is (cost / price per meter) * width. Wait, perhaps the area is (length of paper) * width.\n\nWait, perhaps the cost is directly proportional to the area of paper used. So, the area of the paper is (Total paper area) = (2S * h - 15) m\u00b2.\n\nBut the paper is 50 cm wide, so 0.5 m. The cost is Rs.2 per meter. Hmm, perhaps the cost is Rs.2 per linear meter of the paper. So, each meter of paper (1m length, 0.5m width) costs Rs.2. So, the area of the paper is (cost / 2) * 1 m\u00b2 per Rs.2 * 0.5 m\u00b2. Wait, maybe this is getting complicated. Let me think differently.\n\nThe total cost is Rs.260. The paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 m. The cost is Rs.2 per meter. So, the length of paper used is total cost divided by cost per meter. So, length = 260 / 2 = 130 meters. Because each meter costs Rs.2, so 260 /2 = 130 meters.\n\nThen, the area of the paper is length * width = 130 m * 0.5 m = 65 m\u00b2.\n\nBut this area is equal to the area of the walls minus the area of doors and windows. So, 65 = (2S * h) -15.\n\nBecause the paper covers the walls except for 15 m\u00b2. So, 2S * h = 65 +15 = 80 m\u00b2.\n\nSo, 2S h = 80.\n\nWe also know from the ratio that h/S = 2/5 => h = (2/5) S.\n\nSo, substituting h into the equation:\n\n2S * (2/5 S) =80\n\n=> (4/5) S\u00b2 =80\n\nMultiply both sides by 5: 4 S\u00b2 =400\n\nDivide by 4: S\u00b2=100\n\nSo, S=10 meters.\n\nSince S is the semi-perimeter, which is l + w =10 m.\n\nNow, h = (2/5)* S = (2/5)*10=4 meters.\n\nWait, that would make the height 4 meters, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me recap:\n\n- Cost is Rs.260, paper is 50 cm wide (0.5m), Rs.2 per meter.\n\nSo, the length of paper is 260/2 = 130 meters.\n\nArea of paper is 130 m *0.5 m =65 m\u00b2.\n\nThis area is the wall area minus 15 m\u00b2 (doors and windows). So, wall area is 65 +15=80 m\u00b2.\n\nWall area is 2*(l +w)*h = 2S *h =80.\n\nFrom the ratio h/S=2/5, so h= (2/5) S.\n\nSubstitute into 2S *h =80:\n\n2S * (2/5 S) )= (4/5) S\u00b2 =80.\n\nMultiply both sides by 5: 4 S\u00b2 =400 \u2192 S\u00b2=100 \u2192 S=10 m.\n\nSo, h= (2/5)*10=4 m.\n\nSo the height is 4 m, which is option C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a room's height and semi-perimeter, and I need to find the height. Hmm, let's see. The problem says the height to semi-perimeter ratio is 2:5. So first, I think I should note down what variables are involved.\n\nWait, the semi-perimeter of a room... Oh, right, the room is probably rectangular, so the semi-perimeter would be (length + width)/2, right? Because the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + width), so semi-perimeter is half of that, so (length + width)/2.\n\nSo the ratio is height : semi-perimeter = 2:5. Let me denote height as h and semi-perimeter as s. So h/s = 2/5, which means s = (5h)/2.\n\nNext part: It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls. The paper is 50 cm wide and costs Rs.2 per meter. Oh, and there's an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows which are subtracted. So the area to be covered is the total wall area minus 15.\n\nWait, the walls are being papered. So the area of the walls would be the perimeter of the room multiplied by the height, minus the area for doors and windows. Because the walls are all around, so it's like 2*(length + width) * height, but since semi-perimeter s is (length + width)/2, so the perimeter is 2s. So the wall area would be 2s * h.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the cost is for papering the walls, and they allow 15 sq.m for doors and windows. So the actual area covered is (2s * h) - 15.\n\nSo, the area of paper used is (2s * h -15) sq.m.\n\nNow, the cost is based on the paper used. The paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters. So the length of paper used would be the area divided by the width. So length of paper = (2s * h -15) / 0.5.\n\nBut wait, the cost is Rs.2 per meter. So the total cost would be the length of paper used multiplied by 2.\n\nSo, cost = 2 * ( (2s h -15) / 0.5 ) = 2 * ( (2s h -15) * 2 ) because 1/0.5 is 2. So that becomes 4*(2 s h -15) = 260 Rs.\n\nSo 4*(2 s h -15) = 260 \u2192 2 s h -15 = 260 /4 \u2192 260/4 is 65. So 2 s h = 65 +15 =80. So 2 s h =80.\n\nBut from earlier, s = (5h)/2. So substituting s into this equation.\n\nSo 2*(5h/2)*h =80 \u2192 2*(5h\u00b2/2) )=80 \u2192 (5h\u00b2) =80 \u2192 h\u00b2 =16 \u2192 h=4 m.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So h is 4 meters. Looking at the options, option C is 4m.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSo, let me go through the steps again.\n\n1. h/s = 2/5 \u2192 s = (5h)/2.\n\n2. Wall area is 2*(length + width)*h \u2192 which is 2*(2s)*h \u2192 because perimeter is 2s. So 2*2s*h = 4 s h. But wait, no. Wait, perimeter is 2*(length + width) = 2*(2s) \u2192 no, no, wait. Oh, wait, no. Wait, the semi-perimeter s is (length + width)/2, so perimeter is 2*(length + width) = 2*(2s) \u2192 4s? Wait no, that can't be right. Because s is (l + w)/2 \u2192 l + w = 2s \u2192 perimeter is 2*(l + w) = 4s. Oh, right. So the perimeter is 4s.\n\nWait, but the area of the walls is perimeter multiplied by height. So 4s * h.\n\nBut the problem states that the area for doors and windows is 15 sq.m. So the area to be covered by paper is (4s * h) -15.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2s*h. That's where I might have made a mistake. So let's correct that.\n\nSo the wall area is perimeter * height \u2192 4s * h.\n\nBut the problem says that 15 sq.m is allowed for doors and windows, so the papered area is (4s h -15).\n\nSo the area of the paper is (4s h -15).\n\nThe paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 m. So the length of paper needed is area divided by width: (4s h -15)/0.5.\n\nThe cost per meter of paper is Rs.2. So the total cost is 2 * [ (4s h -15)/0.5 ].\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n2 * [ (4 s h -15) / 0.5 ] = 260.\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nCompute (4 s h -15)/0.5 \u2192 multiply numerator and denominator by 2 \u2192 2*(4 s h -15) \u2192 8 s h -30.\n\nSo cost is 2*(8 s h -30) = 16 s h -60 = 260.\n\nSo 16 s h = 260 +60 = 320 \u2192 s h = 320 /16 = 20.\n\nBut we have s = (5h)/2 \u2192 substitute into s h =20.\n\nSo (5h/2)*h =20 \u2192 (5 h\u00b2)/2 =20 \u2192 5 h\u00b2 =40 \u2192 h\u00b2=8 \u2192 h=\u221a8 \u2192 which is approx 2.828 meters. Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Hmm, something's wrong here.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the wall area calculation. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the wall area is the sum of the areas of all four walls. Each pair of opposite walls has the same area. So two walls have area l * h, and the other two have w * h. So total area is 2lh + 2wh = 2h(l +w) = 2h * (2s) \u2192 because l + w = 2s. So 2h*(2s) =4 s h. Oh, that's correct. So the total wall area is 4 s h.\n\nSo the papered area is 4 s h -15.\n\nSo the length of paper used is (4 s h -15) /0.5 \u2192 because the paper is 0.5 m wide. So (4 s h -15)/0.5 = 2*(4 s h -15) =8 s h -30.\n\nThe cost is Rs.2 per meter of paper. So total cost is 2 * (8 s h -30) =16 s h -60 =260.\n\nSo 16 s h = 260 +60 =320 \u2192 s h =20.\n\nBut s = (5h)/2 \u2192 so (5h/2) * h =20 \u2192 5 h\u00b2 /2 =20 \u2192 5 h\u00b2 =40 \u2192 h\u00b2=8 \u2192 h=\u221a8 = 2\u221a2 \u22482.828 m. But none of the options match this. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, the options are A)2.6, B)3.9, C)4, D)4.2, E)4.4.\n\nHmm, so 2.828 isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nLet me check the cost calculation again.\n\nThe cost is 260 Rs, paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 m. The paper is sold at Rs.2 per meter. So per meter of paper, cost is 2 Rs. So the length of paper used is (4 s h -15)/0.5 meters, because area is length*width \u2192 length = area / width.\n\nSo the cost is (length of paper) * 2 Rs/m. So:\n\nCost = [ (4 s h -15)/0.5 ] * 2 = (4 s h -15) * (2 /0.5) \u2192 2/0.5 is 4 \u2192 so 4*(4 s h -15) = 260.\n\nSo 4*(4 s h -15) =260 \u2192 16 s h -60=260 \u2192 16 s h=320 \u2192 s h=20.\n\nSo same as before. So s h =20.\n\nBut s=5h/2 \u2192 substituting:\n\n(5h/2) * h =20 \u2192 5h\u00b2 /2 =20 \u2192 5h\u00b2=40 \u2192 h\u00b2=8 \u2192 h=2\u221a2 \u22482.828 m.\n\nWait, but that's not one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nProblem says: It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows.\n\nSo perhaps I should model the cost differently. Because sometimes, when they say the cost is Rs.2 per meter, it could be per running meter of the paper. So perhaps the cost is based on the length of paper used.\n\nWait, another approach: The area of the paper needed is (4 s h -15) as before. The paper is 0.5 m wide. So the length of paper needed is (4 s h -15) / 0.5. The cost is Rs.2 per meter of paper, so total cost is 2 * [ (4 s h -15)/0.5 ] = 260.\n\nSo let's compute that:\n\n2 * [ (4 s h -15) /0.5 ] = 260 \u2192 [ (4 s h -15) /0.5 ] = 130 \u2192 4 s h -15 = 130 *0.5 \u2192 4 s h -15 =65 \u2192 4 s h=80 \u2192 s h=20.\n\nAgain, same equation.\n\nHmm, so s h=20, and s=5h/2. So 5h^2/2 =20 \u2192 h\u00b2=8 \u2192 h=2.828 m. But that's not an option. So I must have made a mistake in the initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the semi-perimeter is of the floor, which is (l +w)/2. So that's correct. But perhaps I made a mistake in the wall area calculation.\n\nWait another thought: The problem says the ratio is height to semi-perimeter, which is 2:5. So h/s=2/5 \u2192 s=5h/2.\n\nWait, perhaps the walls are four walls, so the total area is 2*(l +w)*h \u2192 which is 2*(2s)*h \u2192 4 s h. Correct.\n\nSo paper area is 4 s h -15.\n\nPaper width is 0.5 m, so the length needed is (4 s h -15)/0.5.\n\nCost per meter is 2 Rs, so cost is 2 * [(4 s h -15)/0.5] =260.\n\nSo 2*( (4 s h -15)/0.5 ) =260 \u2192 2 * [ (4 s h -15) * 2 ] \u2192 because 1/0.5 is 2.\n\nSo 2 * 2*(4 s h -15) =260 \u21924*(4 s h -15) =260 \u2192 16 s h -60=260 \u219216 s h=320 \u2192 s h=20.\n\nSame result as before.\n\nHmm, but according to this, h is 2.828, which is not in the options. So maybe I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is not h/s=2/5, but h/(semi-perimeter) = 2:5. So h/s = 2/5 \u2192 s=5h/2. That's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the area of the paper is (4 s h) minus 15, but perhaps the area is 2*(l + w)*h -15 \u2192 which is 4 s h -15.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the area of the paper is (2*(l +w)*h -15) \u2192 which is 4 s h -15.\n\nHmm, same as before.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the cost calculation. Let's think: the paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 m. So when you buy paper, the length you buy is the area you need divided by the width of the paper. So, area needed is 4 s h -15.\n\nSo length of paper = (4 s h -15)/0.5.\n\nCost is Rs.2 per meter, so total cost is 2 * ( (4 s h -15)/0.5 ) = 260.\n\nSo let's compute that: 2 / 0.5 is 4 \u2192 4*(4 s h -15) =260 \u2192 16 s h -60=260 \u219216 s h =320 \u2192 s h=20.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is that I'm missing something else. Let me try another approach.\n\nWait, maybe the ratio is 2:5, but perhaps it's height to the perimeter, not semi-perimeter. Did I misread that?\n\nThe question says: The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. So no, it's correct as h/s=2/5.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is 2:5, but the semi-perimeter is of the walls? No, that doesn't make sense. The semi-perimeter is (l + w)/2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio is h/(perimeter) = 2:5. But the problem says semi-perimeter, so I think that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the cost equation. Let's think: the area of paper is (4 s h -15), but the paper is 50 cm wide. So the area of the paper you have to buy is (4 s h -15) sq.m. But the paper is sold in rolls of 0.5 m width. So the length of paper needed is (4 s h -15) /0.5 meters.\n\nThe cost is Rs.2 per meter of paper. So the total cost is (length of paper) * 2.\n\nSo:\n\n( (4 s h -15)/0.5 ) * 2 = 260.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(4 s h -15) * (2 / 0.5 ) )= 260 \u2192 (4 s h -15) *4=260 \u2192 4*(4 s h -15)=260 \u2192 16 s h -60=260 \u219216 s h=320 \u2192 s h=20.\n\nSame result. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the semi-perimeter. Wait, perhaps the semi-perimeter is of the four walls. No, that's the same as the perimeter of the floor.\n\nWait, perhaps the semi-perimeter is (l +w + h)/2. No, that doesn't make sense. The semi-perimeter of a room would be the perimeter of the floor divided by 2.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the semi-perimeter as (l +w)/2, which is correct.\n\nSo perhaps I made a mistake in the cost equation. Let me try again.\n\nThe paper is 0.5 m wide. So, the area of the paper used is (4 s h -15) = paper length * 0.5 m.\n\nSo paper length = (4 s h -15) /0.5.\n\nCost is Rs.2 per meter, so total cost is 2 * paper length.\n\nSo:\n\n2 * [ (4 s h -15)/0.5 ] =260 \u2192 2 * ( (4 s h -15) * 2 ) =260 \u2192 4*(4 s h -15)=260 \u2192 same as before.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo, I'm getting h=2.828, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem says the height to the semi-perimeter is 2:5. So h/s=2/5 \u2192 s=5h/2.\n\nBut perhaps the semi-perimeter is the perimeter of the four walls, which is 4*(l +w), but that doesn't make sense. No, the semi-perimeter is (l +w)/2.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think in terms of variables.\n\nLet me denote l as length and w as width.\n\nGiven:\n\nh/( (l + w)/2 ) = 2/5 \u2192 h = (2/5) * (l + w)/2 \u2192 h = (l +w)/5 \u2192 l +w =5h.\n\nSo l +w =5h.\n\nThe area of the four walls is 2*(l +w)*h \u2192 which is 2*(5h)*h=10 h\u00b2.\n\nBut the papered area is 10 h\u00b2 -15.\n\nThe paper is 0.5 m wide. So the length of paper used is (10 h\u00b2 -15) /0.5 \u2192 2*(10 h\u00b2 -15) \u219220 h\u00b2 -30.\n\nThe cost is 2 Rs per meter, so total cost is 2*(20 h\u00b2 -30) =40 h\u00b2 -60 =260.\n\nSo 40 h\u00b2 =260 +60=320 \u2192 h\u00b2=8 \u2192 h=2.828 m.\n\nAgain, same result. So it's not matching any option.\n\nWait, the options don't have 2.828. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is h/s =5/2, not 2/5. Because maybe I misread the ratio. Let me check the question again.\n\nQuestion says: The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. So h : s = 2:5 \u2192 h/s=2/5. So no, that's correct.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the area of the paper is 2*(l +w)*h, without subtracting 15. No, because the problem says allowing 15 sq.m for doors and windows, so we subtract that.\n\nWait, perhaps the 15 sq.m is the area per room, but I think the problem says 15 sq.m for doors and windows in total.\n\nWait, maybe the 15 is added, but that can't be right. Because papering would require less area if doors and windows are present.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recheck the cost equation again.\n\nWait, perhaps the area of the paper is (4 s h -15), and the paper is 0.5 m wide, so the length of paper is (4 s h -15)/0.5.\n\nCost per meter is 2 Rs, so total cost is 2 * [(4 s h -15)/0.5] =260.\n\nWhich is 2*( (4 s h -15) / 0.5 )=260 \u2192 2*( (4 s h -15)*2 )=260 \u21924*(4 s h -15)=260 \u219216 s h -60=260 \u219216 s h=320 \u2192 s h=20.\n\nWait, but s =5h/2 \u2192 (5h/2)*h=20 \u21925h\u00b2=40 \u2192h\u00b2=8 \u2192h=2.828.\n\nHmm, no option matches. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is h/s=5/2. Let me try that.\n\nIf h/s=5/2 \u2192 s= (2h)/5.\n\nThen, s h = (2h/5)*h= 2h\u00b2/5 =20 \u2192 2h\u00b2=100 \u2192h\u00b2=50 \u2192h=7.07 m, which is not an option either.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the semi-perimeter is of the walls, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's the semi-perimeter of the floor, which is (l +w)/2. So that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the area of the walls is 2*(l +w)*h, but without subtracting 15. Let me see what happens.\n\nSo area of walls is 2*(l +w)*h \u2192 which is 4 s h. So if I don't subtract 15, then:\n\nThe paper area is 4 s h.\n\nThe length of paper is 4 s h / 0.5 =8 s h.\n\nCost is 2 *8 s h =16 s h =260 \u2192 s h=260/16=16.25.\n\nBut s=5h/2 \u2192 (5h/2)*h =16.25 \u21925h\u00b2=32.5 \u2192h\u00b2=6.5 \u2192h\u22482.55 m. Still not an option.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to see the options and see which one fits.\n\nThe options are 2.6, 3.9,4,4.2,4.4.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try solving the equation again.\n\nFrom earlier steps, s h=20.\n\ns=5h/2.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n5h/2 * h =20 \u21925h\u00b2/2=20 \u21925h\u00b2=40 \u2192h\u00b2=8 \u2192h=2.828 m.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem has a typo, or I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute s h=20, and s=5h/2 \u2192 s h= (5h/2)*h=5h\u00b2/2=20 \u2192h\u00b2=8 \u2192h=2.828.\n\nHmm, no. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is 5:2, not 2:5. Let me try that.\n\nIf h/s=5/2 \u2192 s=2h/5.\n\nThen, s h=2h\u00b2/5=20 \u21922h\u00b2=100 \u2192h\u00b2=50 \u2192h=7.07 m. Not in the options.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement says that the ratio is 2:5, but perhaps it's the semi-perimeter to height, not height to semi-perimeter. So s/h=2/5 \u2192 s= (2h)/5.\n\nThen, s h= (2h/5)*h=2 h\u00b2/5=20 \u21922 h\u00b2=100 \u2192h\u00b2=50 \u2192h=7.07 m. Still not matching.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation. Let me think: perhaps the area of the walls is 2*(l +w)*h \u2192 which is 2*(2s)*h=4 s h. That's correct.\n\nSo the papered area is 4 s h -15.\n\nSo length of paper is (4 s h -15)/0.5.\n\nCost is 2 * [ (4 s h -15)/0.5 ] =260.\n\nWhich is 2*( (4 s h -15) * 2 ) \u21924*(4 s h -15)=260 \u219216 s h -60=260 \u219216 s h=320 \u2192s h=20.\n\nSo s h=20. s=5h/2 \u2192 (5h/2)*h=20 \u21925h\u00b2=40 \u2192h\u00b2=8 \u2192h=2.828 m.\n\nHmm, that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is not present, but perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the semi-perimeter is (l +w + h)/2. No, that's not right. The semi-perimeter is of the floor, so (l +w)/2.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the cost calculation again.\n\nWait, the paper is 50 cm wide, so 0.5 meters. So the area of the paper is length * width.\n\nSo, area of paper needed is (4 s h -15) = length * 0.5 \u2192 length = (4 s h -15) /0.5.\n\nThe cost is Rs.2 per meter of paper. So cost = 2 * length \u2192 2 * [ (4 s h -15)/0.5 ] =260.\n\nWhich is 2 * ( (4 s h -15) * 2 ) \u21924*(4 s h -15)=260 \u219216 s h -60=260 \u219216 s h=320 \u2192s h=20.\n\nSame result.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is h : (l +w) =2:5 \u2192 h/(l +w)=2/5 \u2192 l +w= (5h)/2.\n\nSo, l +w=5h/2 \u2192 s=(l +w)/2=5h/4.\n\nWait, that's a different approach. Because earlier I took s= (l +w)/2 \u2192 s=5h/2 when h/s=2/5. But perhaps I should re-express.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial ratio setup. Let me think again.\n\nProblem says: The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5.\n\nSo h : s = 2 :5 \u2192 h/s=2/5 \u2192 s=5h/2.\n\nWhich is what I did earlier.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let me check the options again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)2.6 m\n\nB)3.9 m\n\nC)4 m\n\nD)4.2 m\n\nE)4.4 m.\n\nHmm, if I take h=4 m, then s=5h/2=5*4/2=10 m.\n\ns=10 m.\n\nThen, the area of the walls is 4 s h \u21924*10*4=160.\n\nMinus 15 \u2192145.\n\nLength of paper is 145 /0.5=290 m.\n\nCost is 2 *290=580 Rs. But the problem says cost is 260 Rs. So 4 m gives a cost of 580, which is too high.\n\nSo that's not correct.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is h : perimeter=2:5. Let's try that.\n\nPerimeter is 2*(l +w)=2*(2s)=4s.\n\nSo h :4s=2:5 \u2192 h/(4s)=2/5 \u2192h= (8 s)/5 \u2192 s= (5 h)/8.\n\nThen, s h= (5h/8)*h=5 h\u00b2 /8.\n\nFrom the cost equation, s h=20 \u21925 h\u00b2 /8=20 \u2192h\u00b2= (20 *8)/5=32 \u2192h=\u221a32=4 *\u221a2\u22485.656 m. Not an option.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try each option and see which one gives a cost of 260.\n\nLet me try option C: h=4 m.\n\ns=5h/2=5*4/2=10 m.\n\nSo s=10 m.\n\nWall area=4 s h=4*10*4=160.\n\nSubtract 15: 160-15=145.\n\nLength of paper=145/0.5=290 m.\n\nCost=2*290=580 Rs. But problem says 260. So not matching.\n\nOption B:3.9 m.\n\ns=5*3.9/2=9.75 m.\n\nWall area=4 *9.75 *3.9=4*9.75=39 \u219239 *3.9=152.1.\n\nMinus15 \u2192137.1.\n\nLength of paper=137.1 /0.5=274.2 m.\n\nCost=2*274.2=548.4 Rs. Not 260.\n\nOption E:4.4 m.\n\ns=5*4.4/2=11 m.\n\nWall area=4*11*4.4=44 *4.4=193.6.\n\nMinus15=178.6.\n\nLength=178.6 /0.5=357.2 m.\n\nCost=2*357.2=714.4 Rs. No.\n\nOption A:2.6 m.\n\ns=5*2.6/2=6.5 m.\n\nWall area=4*6.5*2.6=26 *2.6=67.6.\n\nMinus15=52.6.\n\nLength=52.6 /0.5=105.2 m.\n\nCost=2 *105.2=210.4 Rs. Closer, but not 260.\n\nOption D:4.2 m.\n\ns=5*4.2/2=10.5 m.\n\nWall area=4 *10.5 *4.2=42 *4.2=176.4.\n\nMinus15=161.4.\n\nLength=161.4 /0.5=322.8 m.\n\nCost=2 *322.8=645.6 Rs. No.\n\nHmm, none of the options give 260. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the area of the walls is 2*(l +w)*h \u2192 which is 2*(2s)*h=4 s h. But perhaps the semi-perimeter is (l +w), not (l +w)/2. No, that can't be. Semi-perimeter is (l +w)/2.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of the area of the paper as (2*(l +w)*h -15) \u2192 which is 4 s h -15.\n\nSo, paper length is (4 s h -15)/0.5.\n\nCost is 2 * paper length =260.\n\nSo, 2*(4 s h -15)/0.5=260 \u2192 (4 s h -15)/0.25=260 \u21924 s h -15=65 \u21924 s h=80 \u2192s h=20.\n\nSo, same result.\n\nBut with s=5h/2 \u2192 s h=5h\u00b2/2=20 \u2192h\u00b2=8 \u2192h=2.828.\n\nHmm, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is not h/s=2/5, but h/(2s)=2/5 \u2192 h= (4 s)/5 \u2192 s=5 h/4.\n\nThen, s h=5 h\u00b2 /4=20 \u2192h\u00b2=16 \u2192h=4 m.\n\nAh! That's option C.\n\nWait, that's different. So perhaps I misapplied the ratio.\n\nLet me think: if the height to semi-perimeter is 2:5, then h/s=2/5.\n\nBut perhaps the ratio is (height) : (semi-perimeter of the walls). No, that's the same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the ratio. Let me think:\n\nProblem says: The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5.\n\nWhich is h : s =2:5 \u2192 h/s=2/5.\n\nBut perhaps I should express it as s= (5/2) h.\n\nSo, s= (5/2) h.\n\nThen, s h= (5/2) h * h= (5/2) h\u00b2=20 \u21925 h\u00b2=40 \u2192h\u00b2=8 \u2192h=2.828.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, but if I take s= (2/5) h, which would be the other way around.\n\ns= (2/5) h \u2192 s h= (2/5) h^2=20 \u2192h\u00b2=50 \u2192h=7.07 m. Not an option.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio is 5:2, so h/s=5/2 \u2192 h=5s/2.\n\nThen, s h= s*(5s/2)=5 s\u00b2/2=20 \u21925 s\u00b2=40 \u2192s\u00b2=8 \u2192s=2.828 m.\n\nBut then, h=5s/2=5*(2.828)/2=7.07 m. Not an option.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is (h)/(perimeter) =2/5.\n\nPerimeter is 4s \u2192 h/(4s)=2/5 \u2192 h= (8 s)/5 \u2192 s=5h/8.\n\nThen, s h=5h\u00b2/8=20 \u2192h\u00b2=32 \u2192h=4\u221a2\u22485.656 m. Not an option.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial ratio is correct, but I made a mistake in the wall area calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the walls are only three walls, but that's not usual.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the semi-perimeter is the perimeter of the room divided by 2, which is same as (l +w)/2.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the area of the paper as 2*(l +w)*h -15 = 4 s h -15.\n\nSo, paper length= (4 s h -15)/0.5.\n\nCost=2 * paper length=260.\n\nSo, 2*(4 s h -15)/0.5=260 \u2192 (4 s h -15)/0.25=260 \u21924 s h -15=65 \u21924 s h=80 \u2192s h=20.\n\nBut s=5h/2 \u2192 (5h/2)*h=20 \u21925h\u00b2=40 \u2192h\u00b2=8 \u2192h=2.828.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem allows for the semi-perimeter to be (l +w), not divided by 2. Let's try that.\n\nIf s= l +w \u2192 then ratio h/s=2/5 \u2192 s=5h/2.\n\nSo, wall area=2*(l +w)*h=2 s h \u21922*(5h/2)*h=5h\u00b2.\n\nMinus 15 \u21925h\u00b2-15.\n\nPaper length= (5h\u00b2-15)/0.5 \u21922*(5h\u00b2-15)=10 h\u00b2-30.\n\nCost=2*(10 h\u00b2 -30)=20 h\u00b2 -60=260 \u219220 h\u00b2=320 \u2192h\u00b2=16 \u2192h=4 m.\n\nAh! So that gives h=4 m, which is option C.\n\nSo perhaps I made a mistake in the definition of semi-perimeter. Maybe the problem considers the semi-perimeter as (l +w), not (l +w)/2.\n\nSo, if s=l +w, then h/s=2/5 \u2192 s=5h/2.\n\nThen, wall area=2*(l +w)*h=2 s h=2*(5h/2)*h=5 h\u00b2.\n\nSo papered area is 5h\u00b2 -15.\n\nPaper length=(5h\u00b2 -15)/0.5=2*(5h\u00b2 -15)=10 h\u00b2 -30.\n\nCost=2*(10 h\u00b2 -30)=20 h\u00b2 -60=260 \u219220 h\u00b2=320 \u2192h\u00b2=16 \u2192h=4 m.\n\nThat's option C.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem defines semi-perimeter as (l +w), not (l +w)/2. So I think that's the mistake I made earlier.\n\nSo the correct answer is C)4 m.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves finding the height of a room given the ratio of height to semi-perimeter (2:5) and the cost of papering the walls. The key steps to solve the problem are as follows:\n\n1. **Define Variables and Ratios**:  \n   Let the height of the room be \\( h \\) and the semi-perimeter be \\( s \\). The ratio \\( h:s = 2:5 \\) implies \\( h/s = 2/5 \\), so \\( s = \\frac{5h}{2} \\).\n\n2. **Wall Area Calculation**:  \n   The total wall area is given by \\( 2 \\times (l + w) \\times h \\), where \\( l \\) and \\( w \\) are the length and width of the room. Since \\( s = \\frac{l + w}{2} \\), the perimeter is \\( 2 \\times (l + w) = 4s \\). Thus, the wall area becomes \\( 4s \\times h \\). Subtracting the area of doors and windows (15 \\( \\text{sq.m} \\)), the papered area is \\( 4sh - 15 \\).\n\n3. **Paper Length and Cost**:  \n   The paper is 50 cm wide (\\( 0.5 \\, \\text{m} \\)), so the length of paper required is \\( \\frac{4sh - 15}{0.5} \\). The cost of paper is Rs. 2 per meter, so the total cost is \\( 2 \\times \\frac{4sh - 15}{0.5} \\). Setting this equal to Rs. 260 gives:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times \\frac{4sh - 15}{0.5} = 260\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times (4sh - 15) = 260 \\implies 16sh - 60 = 260 \\implies 16sh = 320 \\implies sh = 20\n   \\]\n\n4. **Substitute \\( s = \\frac{5h}{2} \\)**:  \n   Substituting \\( s = \\frac{5h}{2} \\) into \\( sh = 20 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{5h}{2} \\times h = 20 \\implies \\frac{5h^2}{2} = 20 \\implies 5h^2 = 40 \\implies h^2 = 8 \\implies h = \\sqrt{8} \\approx 2.828 \\, \\text{m}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Revisiting the Semi-Perimeter Definition**:  \n   The calculated height (\\( h \\approx 2.828 \\, \\text{m} \\)) does not match any of the provided options. This suggests a possible misinterpretation of the semi-perimeter. If the semi-perimeter is defined as \\( s = l + w \\) (instead of \\( s = \\frac{l + w}{2} \\)), the ratio \\( h/s = 2/5 \\) implies \\( s = \\frac{5h}{2} \\). The wall area then becomes \\( 2sh = 2 \\times \\frac{5h}{2} \\times h = 5h^2 \\). Subtracting the area for doors and windows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Papered area} = 5h^2 - 15\n   \\]\n   The length of paper required is \\( \\frac{5h^2 - 15}{0.5} \\), and the total cost is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times \\frac{5h^2 - 15}{0.5} = 260 \\implies 4 \\times (5h^2 - 15) = 260 \\implies 20h^2 - 60 = 260 \\implies 20h^2 = 320 \\implies h^2 = 16 \\implies h = 4 \\, \\text{m}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Verification**:  \n   Substituting \\( h = 4 \\, \\text{m} \\) into \\( s = \\frac{5h}{2} \\), we get \\( s = 10 \\, \\text{m} \\). The wall area is \\( 4sh = 4 \\times 10 \\times 4 = 160 \\, \\text{sq.m} \\). Subtracting 15 \\( \\text{sq.m} \\) for doors and windows gives \\( 145 \\, \\text{sq.m} \\). The length of paper required is \\( \\frac{145}{0.5} = 290 \\, \\text{m} \\), and the total cost is \\( 2 \\times 290 = 580 \\, \\text{Rs} \\), which does not match the given cost of 260 Rs. This discrepancy suggests an alternative interpretation of the semi-perimeter is needed.\n\n7. **Final Interpretation**:  \n   If the semi-perimeter is interpreted as \\( s = l + w \\), the height \\( h = 4 \\, \\text{m} \\) satisfies the ratio \\( h/s = 2/5 \\) and aligns with the provided options. Thus, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: C**",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a room's height and semi-perimeter, and I need to find the height. Hmm, let's see. The problem says the height to semi-perimeter ratio is 2:5. So first, I think I should note down what variables are involved.\n\nWait, the semi-perimeter of a room... Oh, right, the room is probably rectangular, so the semi-perimeter would be (length + width)/2, right? Because the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + width), so semi-perimeter is half of that, so (length + width)/2.\n\nSo the ratio is height : semi-perimeter = 2:5. Let me denote height as h and semi-perimeter as s. So h/s = 2/5, which means s = (5h)/2.\n\nNext part: It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls. The paper is 50 cm wide and costs Rs.2 per meter. Oh, and there's an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows which are subtracted. So the area to be covered is the total wall area minus 15.\n\nWait, the walls are being papered. So the area of the walls would be the perimeter of the room multiplied by the height, minus the area for doors and windows. Because the walls are all around, so it's like 2*(length + width) * height, but since semi-perimeter s is (length + width)/2, so the perimeter is 2s. So the wall area would be 2s * h.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the cost is for papering the walls, and they allow 15 sq.m for doors and windows. So the actual area covered is (2s * h) - 15.\n\nSo, the area of paper used is (2s * h -15) sq.m.\n\nNow, the cost is based on the paper used. The paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters. So the length of paper used would be the area divided by the width. So length of paper = (2s * h -15) / 0.5.\n\nBut wait, the cost is Rs.2 per meter. So the total cost would be the length of paper used multiplied by 2.\n\nSo, cost = 2 * ( (2s h -15) / 0.5 ) = 2 * ( (2s h -15) * 2 ) because 1/0.5 is 2. So that becomes 4*(2 s h -15) = 260 Rs.\n\nSo 4*(2 s h -15) = 260 \u2192 2 s h -15 = 260 /4 \u2192 260/4 is 65. So 2 s h = 65 +15 =80. So 2 s h =80.\n\nBut from earlier, s = (5h)/2. So substituting s into this equation.\n\nSo 2*(5h/2)*h =80 \u2192 2*(5h\u00b2/2) )=80 \u2192 (5h\u00b2) =80 \u2192 h\u00b2 =16 \u2192 h=4 m.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So h is 4 meters. Looking at the options, option C is 4m.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSo, let me go through the steps again.\n\n1. h/s = 2/5 \u2192 s = (5h)/2.\n\n2. Wall area is 2*(length + width)*h \u2192 which is 2*(2s)*h \u2192 because perimeter is 2s. So 2*2s*h = 4 s h. But wait, no. Wait, perimeter is 2*(length + width) = 2*(2s) \u2192 no, no, wait. Oh, wait, no. Wait, the semi-perimeter s is (length + width)/2, so perimeter is 2*(length + width) = 2*(2s) \u2192 4s? Wait no, that can't be right. Because s is (l + w)/2 \u2192 l + w = 2s \u2192 perimeter is 2*(l + w) = 4s. Oh, right. So the perimeter is 4s.\n\nWait, but the area of the walls is perimeter multiplied by height. So 4s * h.\n\nBut the problem states that the area for doors and windows is 15 sq.m. So the area to be covered by paper is (4s * h) -15.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2s*h. That's where I might have made a mistake. So let's correct that.\n\nSo the wall area is perimeter * height \u2192 4s * h.\n\nBut the problem says that 15 sq.m is allowed for doors and windows, so the papered area is (4s h -15).\n\nSo the area of the paper is (4s h -15).\n\nThe paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 m. So the length of paper needed is area divided by width: (4s h -15)/0.5.\n\nThe cost per meter of paper is Rs.2. So the total cost is 2 * [ (4s h -15)/0.5 ].\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n2 * [ (4 s h -15) / 0.5 ] = 260.\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nCompute (4 s h -15)/0.5 \u2192 multiply numerator and denominator by 2 \u2192 2*(4 s h -15) \u2192 8 s h -30.\n\nSo cost is 2*(8 s h -30) = 16 s h -60 = 260.\n\nSo 16 s h = 260 +60 = 320 \u2192 s h = 320 /16 = 20.\n\nBut we have s = (5h)/2 \u2192 substitute into s h =20.\n\nSo (5h/2)*h =20 \u2192 (5 h\u00b2)/2 =20 \u2192 5 h\u00b2 =40 \u2192 h\u00b2=8 \u2192 h=\u221a8 \u2192 which is approx 2.828 meters. Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Hmm, something's wrong here.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the wall area calculation. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the wall area is the sum of the areas of all four walls. Each pair of opposite walls has the same area. So two walls have area l * h, and the other two have w * h. So total area is 2lh + 2wh = 2h(l +w) = 2h * (2s) \u2192 because l + w = 2s. So 2h*(2s) =4 s h. Oh, that's correct. So the total wall area is 4 s h.\n\nSo the papered area is 4 s h -15.\n\nSo the length of paper used is (4 s h -15) /0.5 \u2192 because the paper is 0.5 m wide. So (4 s h -15)/0.5 = 2*(4 s h -15) =8 s h -30.\n\nThe cost is Rs.2 per meter of paper. So total cost is 2 * (8 s h -30) =16 s h -60 =260.\n\nSo 16 s h = 260 +60 =320 \u2192 s h =20.\n\nBut s = (5h)/2 \u2192 so (5h/2) * h =20 \u2192 5 h\u00b2 /2 =20 \u2192 5 h\u00b2 =40 \u2192 h\u00b2=8 \u2192 h=\u221a8 = 2\u221a2 \u22482.828 m. But none of the options match this. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, the options are A)2.6, B)3.9, C)4, D)4.2, E)4.4.\n\nHmm, so 2.828 isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nLet me check the cost calculation again.\n\nThe cost is 260 Rs, paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 m. The paper is sold at Rs.2 per meter. So per meter of paper, cost is 2 Rs. So the length of paper used is (4 s h -15)/0.5 meters, because area is length*width \u2192 length = area / width.\n\nSo the cost is (length of paper) * 2 Rs/m. So:\n\nCost = [ (4 s h -15)/0.5 ] * 2 = (4 s h -15) * (2 /0.5) \u2192 2/0.5 is 4 \u2192 so 4*(4 s h -15) = 260.\n\nSo 4*(4 s h -15) =260 \u2192 16 s h -60=260 \u2192 16 s h=320 \u2192 s h=20.\n\nSo same as before. So s h =20.\n\nBut s=5h/2 \u2192 substituting:\n\n(5h/2) * h =20 \u2192 5h\u00b2 /2 =20 \u2192 5h\u00b2=40 \u2192 h\u00b2=8 \u2192 h=2\u221a2 \u22482.828 m.\n\nWait, but that's not one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nProblem says: It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows.\n\nSo perhaps I should model the cost differently. Because sometimes, when they say the cost is Rs.2 per meter, it could be per running meter of the paper. So perhaps the cost is based on the length of paper used.\n\nWait, another approach: The area of the paper needed is (4 s h -15) as before. The paper is 0.5 m wide. So the length of paper needed is (4 s h -15) / 0.5. The cost is Rs.2 per meter of paper, so total cost is 2 * [ (4 s h -15)/0.5 ] = 260.\n\nSo let's compute that:\n\n2 * [ (4 s h -15) /0.5 ] = 260 \u2192 [ (4 s h -15) /0.5 ] = 130 \u2192 4 s h -15 = 130 *0.5 \u2192 4 s h -15 =65 \u2192 4 s h=80 \u2192 s h=20.\n\nAgain, same equation.\n\nHmm, so s h=20, and s=5h/2. So 5h^2/2 =20 \u2192 h\u00b2=8 \u2192 h=2.828 m. But that's not an option. So I must have made a mistake in the initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the semi-perimeter is of the floor, which is (l +w)/2. So that's correct. But perhaps I made a mistake in the wall area calculation.\n\nWait another thought: The problem says the ratio is height to semi-perimeter, which is 2:5. So h/s=2/5 \u2192 s=5h/2.\n\nWait, perhaps the walls are four walls, so the total area is 2*(l +w)*h \u2192 which is 2*(2s)*h \u2192 4 s h. Correct.\n\nSo paper area is 4 s h -15.\n\nPaper width is 0.5 m, so the length needed is (4 s h -15)/0.5.\n\nCost per meter is 2 Rs, so cost is 2 * [(4 s h -15)/0.5] =260.\n\nSo 2*( (4 s h -15)/0.5 ) =260 \u2192 2 * [ (4 s h -15) * 2 ] \u2192 because 1/0.5 is 2.\n\nSo 2 * 2*(4 s h -15) =260 \u21924*(4 s h -15) =260 \u2192 16 s h -60=260 \u219216 s h=320 \u2192 s h=20.\n\nSame result as before.\n\nHmm, but according to this, h is 2.828, which is not in the options. So maybe I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is not h/s=2/5, but h/(semi-perimeter) = 2:5. So h/s = 2/5 \u2192 s=5h/2. That's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the area of the paper is (4 s h) minus 15, but perhaps the area is 2*(l + w)*h -15 \u2192 which is 4 s h -15.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the area of the paper is (2*(l +w)*h -15) \u2192 which is 4 s h -15.\n\nHmm, same as before.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the cost calculation. Let's think: the paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 m. So when you buy paper, the length you buy is the area you need divided by the width of the paper. So, area needed is 4 s h -15.\n\nSo length of paper = (4 s h -15)/0.5.\n\nCost is Rs.2 per meter, so total cost is 2 * ( (4 s h -15)/0.5 ) = 260.\n\nSo let's compute that: 2 / 0.5 is 4 \u2192 4*(4 s h -15) =260 \u2192 16 s h -60=260 \u219216 s h =320 \u2192 s h=20.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is that I'm missing something else. Let me try another approach.\n\nWait, maybe the ratio is 2:5, but perhaps it's height to the perimeter, not semi-perimeter. Did I misread that?\n\nThe question says: The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. So no, it's correct as h/s=2/5.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is 2:5, but the semi-perimeter is of the walls? No, that doesn't make sense. The semi-perimeter is (l + w)/2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio is h/(perimeter) = 2:5. But the problem says semi-perimeter, so I think that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the cost equation. Let's think: the area of paper is (4 s h -15), but the paper is 50 cm wide. So the area of the paper you have to buy is (4 s h -15) sq.m. But the paper is sold in rolls of 0.5 m width. So the length of paper needed is (4 s h -15) /0.5 meters.\n\nThe cost is Rs.2 per meter of paper. So the total cost is (length of paper) * 2.\n\nSo:\n\n( (4 s h -15)/0.5 ) * 2 = 260.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(4 s h -15) * (2 / 0.5 ) )= 260 \u2192 (4 s h -15) *4=260 \u2192 4*(4 s h -15)=260 \u2192 16 s h -60=260 \u219216 s h=320 \u2192 s h=20.\n\nSame result. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the semi-perimeter. Wait, perhaps the semi-perimeter is of the four walls. No, that's the same as the perimeter of the floor.\n\nWait, perhaps the semi-perimeter is (l +w + h)/2. No, that doesn't make sense. The semi-perimeter of a room would be the perimeter of the floor divided by 2.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the semi-perimeter as (l +w)/2, which is correct.\n\nSo perhaps I made a mistake in the cost equation. Let me try again.\n\nThe paper is 0.5 m wide. So, the area of the paper used is (4 s h -15) = paper length * 0.5 m.\n\nSo paper length = (4 s h -15) /0.5.\n\nCost is Rs.2 per meter, so total cost is 2 * paper length.\n\nSo:\n\n2 * [ (4 s h -15)/0.5 ] =260 \u2192 2 * ( (4 s h -15) * 2 ) =260 \u2192 4*(4 s h -15)=260 \u2192 same as before.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo, I'm getting h=2.828, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem says the height to the semi-perimeter is 2:5. So h/s=2/5 \u2192 s=5h/2.\n\nBut perhaps the semi-perimeter is the perimeter of the four walls, which is 4*(l +w), but that doesn't make sense. No, the semi-perimeter is (l +w)/2.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think in terms of variables.\n\nLet me denote l as length and w as width.\n\nGiven:\n\nh/( (l + w)/2 ) = 2/5 \u2192 h = (2/5) * (l + w)/2 \u2192 h = (l +w)/5 \u2192 l +w =5h.\n\nSo l +w =5h.\n\nThe area of the four walls is 2*(l +w)*h \u2192 which is 2*(5h)*h=10 h\u00b2.\n\nBut the papered area is 10 h\u00b2 -15.\n\nThe paper is 0.5 m wide. So the length of paper used is (10 h\u00b2 -15) /0.5 \u2192 2*(10 h\u00b2 -15) \u219220 h\u00b2 -30.\n\nThe cost is 2 Rs per meter, so total cost is 2*(20 h\u00b2 -30) =40 h\u00b2 -60 =260.\n\nSo 40 h\u00b2 =260 +60=320 \u2192 h\u00b2=8 \u2192 h=2.828 m.\n\nAgain, same result. So it's not matching any option.\n\nWait, the options don't have 2.828. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is h/s =5/2, not 2/5. Because maybe I misread the ratio. Let me check the question again.\n\nQuestion says: The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. So h : s = 2:5 \u2192 h/s=2/5. So no, that's correct.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the area of the paper is 2*(l +w)*h, without subtracting 15. No, because the problem says allowing 15 sq.m for doors and windows, so we subtract that.\n\nWait, perhaps the 15 sq.m is the area per room, but I think the problem says 15 sq.m for doors and windows in total.\n\nWait, maybe the 15 is added, but that can't be right. Because papering would require less area if doors and windows are present.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recheck the cost equation again.\n\nWait, perhaps the area of the paper is (4 s h -15), and the paper is 0.5 m wide, so the length of paper is (4 s h -15)/0.5.\n\nCost per meter is 2 Rs, so total cost is 2 * [(4 s h -15)/0.5] =260.\n\nWhich is 2*( (4 s h -15) / 0.5 )=260 \u2192 2*( (4 s h -15)*2 )=260 \u21924*(4 s h -15)=260 \u219216 s h -60=260 \u219216 s h=320 \u2192 s h=20.\n\nWait, but s =5h/2 \u2192 (5h/2)*h=20 \u21925h\u00b2=40 \u2192h\u00b2=8 \u2192h=2.828.\n\nHmm, no option matches. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is h/s=5/2. Let me try that.\n\nIf h/s=5/2 \u2192 s= (2h)/5.\n\nThen, s h = (2h/5)*h= 2h\u00b2/5 =20 \u2192 2h\u00b2=100 \u2192h\u00b2=50 \u2192h=7.07 m, which is not an option either.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the semi-perimeter is of the walls, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's the semi-perimeter of the floor, which is (l +w)/2. So that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the area of the walls is 2*(l +w)*h, but without subtracting 15. Let me see what happens.\n\nSo area of walls is 2*(l +w)*h \u2192 which is 4 s h. So if I don't subtract 15, then:\n\nThe paper area is 4 s h.\n\nThe length of paper is 4 s h / 0.5 =8 s h.\n\nCost is 2 *8 s h =16 s h =260 \u2192 s h=260/16=16.25.\n\nBut s=5h/2 \u2192 (5h/2)*h =16.25 \u21925h\u00b2=32.5 \u2192h\u00b2=6.5 \u2192h\u22482.55 m. Still not an option.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to see the options and see which one fits.\n\nThe options are 2.6, 3.9,4,4.2,4.4.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try solving the equation again.\n\nFrom earlier steps, s h=20.\n\ns=5h/2.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n5h/2 * h =20 \u21925h\u00b2/2=20 \u21925h\u00b2=40 \u2192h\u00b2=8 \u2192h=2.828 m.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem has a typo, or I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute s h=20, and s=5h/2 \u2192 s h= (5h/2)*h=5h\u00b2/2=20 \u2192h\u00b2=8 \u2192h=2.828.\n\nHmm, no. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is 5:2, not 2:5. Let me try that.\n\nIf h/s=5/2 \u2192 s=2h/5.\n\nThen, s h=2h\u00b2/5=20 \u21922h\u00b2=100 \u2192h\u00b2=50 \u2192h=7.07 m. Not in the options.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement says that the ratio is 2:5, but perhaps it's the semi-perimeter to height, not height to semi-perimeter. So s/h=2/5 \u2192 s= (2h)/5.\n\nThen, s h= (2h/5)*h=2 h\u00b2/5=20 \u21922 h\u00b2=100 \u2192h\u00b2=50 \u2192h=7.07 m. Still not matching.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation. Let me think: perhaps the area of the walls is 2*(l +w)*h \u2192 which is 2*(2s)*h=4 s h. That's correct.\n\nSo the papered area is 4 s h -15.\n\nSo length of paper is (4 s h -15)/0.5.\n\nCost is 2 * [ (4 s h -15)/0.5 ] =260.\n\nWhich is 2*( (4 s h -15) * 2 ) \u21924*(4 s h -15)=260 \u219216 s h -60=260 \u219216 s h=320 \u2192s h=20.\n\nSo s h=20. s=5h/2 \u2192 (5h/2)*h=20 \u21925h\u00b2=40 \u2192h\u00b2=8 \u2192h=2.828 m.\n\nHmm, that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is not present, but perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the semi-perimeter is (l +w + h)/2. No, that's not right. The semi-perimeter is of the floor, so (l +w)/2.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the cost calculation again.\n\nWait, the paper is 50 cm wide, so 0.5 meters. So the area of the paper is length * width.\n\nSo, area of paper needed is (4 s h -15) = length * 0.5 \u2192 length = (4 s h -15) /0.5.\n\nThe cost is Rs.2 per meter of paper. So cost = 2 * length \u2192 2 * [ (4 s h -15)/0.5 ] =260.\n\nWhich is 2 * ( (4 s h -15) * 2 ) \u21924*(4 s h -15)=260 \u219216 s h -60=260 \u219216 s h=320 \u2192s h=20.\n\nSame result.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is h : (l +w) =2:5 \u2192 h/(l +w)=2/5 \u2192 l +w= (5h)/2.\n\nSo, l +w=5h/2 \u2192 s=(l +w)/2=5h/4.\n\nWait, that's a different approach. Because earlier I took s= (l +w)/2 \u2192 s=5h/2 when h/s=2/5. But perhaps I should re-express.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial ratio setup. Let me think again.\n\nProblem says: The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5.\n\nSo h : s = 2 :5 \u2192 h/s=2/5 \u2192 s=5h/2.\n\nWhich is what I did earlier.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let me check the options again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)2.6 m\n\nB)3.9 m\n\nC)4 m\n\nD)4.2 m\n\nE)4.4 m.\n\nHmm, if I take h=4 m, then s=5h/2=5*4/2=10 m.\n\ns=10 m.\n\nThen, the area of the walls is 4 s h \u21924*10*4=160.\n\nMinus 15 \u2192145.\n\nLength of paper is 145 /0.5=290 m.\n\nCost is 2 *290=580 Rs. But the problem says cost is 260 Rs. So 4 m gives a cost of 580, which is too high.\n\nSo that's not correct.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is h : perimeter=2:5. Let's try that.\n\nPerimeter is 2*(l +w)=2*(2s)=4s.\n\nSo h :4s=2:5 \u2192 h/(4s)=2/5 \u2192h= (8 s)/5 \u2192 s= (5 h)/8.\n\nThen, s h= (5h/8)*h=5 h\u00b2 /8.\n\nFrom the cost equation, s h=20 \u21925 h\u00b2 /8=20 \u2192h\u00b2= (20 *8)/5=32 \u2192h=\u221a32=4 *\u221a2\u22485.656 m. Not an option.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try each option and see which one gives a cost of 260.\n\nLet me try option C: h=4 m.\n\ns=5h/2=5*4/2=10 m.\n\nSo s=10 m.\n\nWall area=4 s h=4*10*4=160.\n\nSubtract 15: 160-15=145.\n\nLength of paper=145/0.5=290 m.\n\nCost=2*290=580 Rs. But problem says 260. So not matching.\n\nOption B:3.9 m.\n\ns=5*3.9/2=9.75 m.\n\nWall area=4 *9.75 *3.9=4*9.75=39 \u219239 *3.9=152.1.\n\nMinus15 \u2192137.1.\n\nLength of paper=137.1 /0.5=274.2 m.\n\nCost=2*274.2=548.4 Rs. Not 260.\n\nOption E:4.4 m.\n\ns=5*4.4/2=11 m.\n\nWall area=4*11*4.4=44 *4.4=193.6.\n\nMinus15=178.6.\n\nLength=178.6 /0.5=357.2 m.\n\nCost=2*357.2=714.4 Rs. No.\n\nOption A:2.6 m.\n\ns=5*2.6/2=6.5 m.\n\nWall area=4*6.5*2.6=26 *2.6=67.6.\n\nMinus15=52.6.\n\nLength=52.6 /0.5=105.2 m.\n\nCost=2 *105.2=210.4 Rs. Closer, but not 260.\n\nOption D:4.2 m.\n\ns=5*4.2/2=10.5 m.\n\nWall area=4 *10.5 *4.2=42 *4.2=176.4.\n\nMinus15=161.4.\n\nLength=161.4 /0.5=322.8 m.\n\nCost=2 *322.8=645.6 Rs. No.\n\nHmm, none of the options give 260. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the area of the walls is 2*(l +w)*h \u2192 which is 2*(2s)*h=4 s h. But perhaps the semi-perimeter is (l +w), not (l +w)/2. No, that can't be. Semi-perimeter is (l +w)/2.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of the area of the paper as (2*(l +w)*h -15) \u2192 which is 4 s h -15.\n\nSo, paper length is (4 s h -15)/0.5.\n\nCost is 2 * paper length =260.\n\nSo, 2*(4 s h -15)/0.5=260 \u2192 (4 s h -15)/0.25=260 \u21924 s h -15=65 \u21924 s h=80 \u2192s h=20.\n\nSo, same result.\n\nBut with s=5h/2 \u2192 s h=5h\u00b2/2=20 \u2192h\u00b2=8 \u2192h=2.828.\n\nHmm, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is not h/s=2/5, but h/(2s)=2/5 \u2192 h= (4 s)/5 \u2192 s=5 h/4.\n\nThen, s h=5 h\u00b2 /4=20 \u2192h\u00b2=16 \u2192h=4 m.\n\nAh! That's option C.\n\nWait, that's different. So perhaps I misapplied the ratio.\n\nLet me think: if the height to semi-perimeter is 2:5, then h/s=2/5.\n\nBut perhaps the ratio is (height) : (semi-perimeter of the walls). No, that's the same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the ratio. Let me think:\n\nProblem says: The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5.\n\nWhich is h : s =2:5 \u2192 h/s=2/5.\n\nBut perhaps I should express it as s= (5/2) h.\n\nSo, s= (5/2) h.\n\nThen, s h= (5/2) h * h= (5/2) h\u00b2=20 \u21925 h\u00b2=40 \u2192h\u00b2=8 \u2192h=2.828.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, but if I take s= (2/5) h, which would be the other way around.\n\ns= (2/5) h \u2192 s h= (2/5) h^2=20 \u2192h\u00b2=50 \u2192h=7.07 m. Not an option.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio is 5:2, so h/s=5/2 \u2192 h=5s/2.\n\nThen, s h= s*(5s/2)=5 s\u00b2/2=20 \u21925 s\u00b2=40 \u2192s\u00b2=8 \u2192s=2.828 m.\n\nBut then, h=5s/2=5*(2.828)/2=7.07 m. Not an option.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is (h)/(perimeter) =2/5.\n\nPerimeter is 4s \u2192 h/(4s)=2/5 \u2192 h= (8 s)/5 \u2192 s=5h/8.\n\nThen, s h=5h\u00b2/8=20 \u2192h\u00b2=32 \u2192h=4\u221a2\u22485.656 m. Not an option.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial ratio is correct, but I made a mistake in the wall area calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the walls are only three walls, but that's not usual.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the semi-perimeter is the perimeter of the room divided by 2, which is same as (l +w)/2.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the area of the paper as 2*(l +w)*h -15 = 4 s h -15.\n\nSo, paper length= (4 s h -15)/0.5.\n\nCost=2 * paper length=260.\n\nSo, 2*(4 s h -15)/0.5=260 \u2192 (4 s h -15)/0.25=260 \u21924 s h -15=65 \u21924 s h=80 \u2192s h=20.\n\nBut s=5h/2 \u2192 (5h/2)*h=20 \u21925h\u00b2=40 \u2192h\u00b2=8 \u2192h=2.828.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem allows for the semi-perimeter to be (l +w), not divided by 2. Let's try that.\n\nIf s= l +w \u2192 then ratio h/s=2/5 \u2192 s=5h/2.\n\nSo, wall area=2*(l +w)*h=2 s h \u21922*(5h/2)*h=5h\u00b2.\n\nMinus 15 \u21925h\u00b2-15.\n\nPaper length= (5h\u00b2-15)/0.5 \u21922*(5h\u00b2-15)=10 h\u00b2-30.\n\nCost=2*(10 h\u00b2 -30)=20 h\u00b2 -60=260 \u219220 h\u00b2=320 \u2192h\u00b2=16 \u2192h=4 m.\n\nAh! So that gives h=4 m, which is option C.\n\nSo perhaps I made a mistake in the definition of semi-perimeter. Maybe the problem considers the semi-perimeter as (l +w), not (l +w)/2.\n\nSo, if s=l +w, then h/s=2/5 \u2192 s=5h/2.\n\nThen, wall area=2*(l +w)*h=2 s h=2*(5h/2)*h=5 h\u00b2.\n\nSo papered area is 5h\u00b2 -15.\n\nPaper length=(5h\u00b2 -15)/0.5=2*(5h\u00b2 -15)=10 h\u00b2 -30.\n\nCost=2*(10 h\u00b2 -30)=20 h\u00b2 -60=260 \u219220 h\u00b2=320 \u2192h\u00b2=16 \u2192h=4 m.\n\nThat's option C.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem defines semi-perimeter as (l +w), not (l +w)/2. So I think that's the mistake I made earlier.\n\nSo the correct answer is C)4 m.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the height of a room given the ratio of height to semi-perimeter (2:5) and the cost of papering the walls. The key steps to solve the problem are as follows:\n\n1. **Define Variables and Ratios**:  \n   Let the height of the room be \\( h \\) and the semi-perimeter be \\( s \\). The ratio \\( h:s = 2:5 \\) implies \\( h/s = 2/5 \\), so \\( s = \\frac{5h}{2} \\).\n\n2. **Wall Area Calculation**:  \n   The total wall area is given by \\( 2 \\times (l + w) \\times h \\), where \\( l \\) and \\( w \\) are the length and width of the room. Since \\( s = \\frac{l + w}{2} \\), the perimeter is \\( 2 \\times (l + w) = 4s \\). Thus, the wall area becomes \\( 4s \\times h \\). Subtracting the area of doors and windows (15 \\( \\text{sq.m} \\)), the papered area is \\( 4sh - 15 \\).\n\n3. **Paper Length and Cost**:  \n   The paper is 50 cm wide (\\( 0.5 \\, \\text{m} \\)), so the length of paper required is \\( \\frac{4sh - 15}{0.5} \\). The cost of paper is Rs. 2 per meter, so the total cost is \\( 2 \\times \\frac{4sh - 15}{0.5} \\). Setting this equal to Rs. 260 gives:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times \\frac{4sh - 15}{0.5} = 260\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times (4sh - 15) = 260 \\implies 16sh - 60 = 260 \\implies 16sh = 320 \\implies sh = 20\n   \\]\n\n4. **Substitute \\( s = \\frac{5h}{2} \\)**:  \n   Substituting \\( s = \\frac{5h}{2} \\) into \\( sh = 20 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{5h}{2} \\times h = 20 \\implies \\frac{5h^2}{2} = 20 \\implies 5h^2 = 40 \\implies h^2 = 8 \\implies h = \\sqrt{8} \\approx 2.828 \\, \\text{m}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Revisiting the Semi-Perimeter Definition**:  \n   The calculated height (\\( h \\approx 2.828 \\, \\text{m} \\)) does not match any of the provided options. This suggests a possible misinterpretation of the semi-perimeter. If the semi-perimeter is defined as \\( s = l + w \\) (instead of \\( s = \\frac{l + w}{2} \\)), the ratio \\( h/s = 2/5 \\) implies \\( s = \\frac{5h}{2} \\). The wall area then becomes \\( 2sh = 2 \\times \\frac{5h}{2} \\times h = 5h^2 \\). Subtracting the area for doors and windows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Papered area} = 5h^2 - 15\n   \\]\n   The length of paper required is \\( \\frac{5h^2 - 15}{0.5} \\), and the total cost is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times \\frac{5h^2 - 15}{0.5} = 260 \\implies 4 \\times (5h^2 - 15) = 260 \\implies 20h^2 - 60 = 260 \\implies 20h^2 = 320 \\implies h^2 = 16 \\implies h = 4 \\, \\text{m}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Verification**:  \n   Substituting \\( h = 4 \\, \\text{m} \\) into \\( s = \\frac{5h}{2} \\), we get \\( s = 10 \\, \\text{m} \\). The wall area is \\( 4sh = 4 \\times 10 \\times 4 = 160 \\, \\text{sq.m} \\). Subtracting 15 \\( \\text{sq.m} \\) for doors and windows gives \\( 145 \\, \\text{sq.m} \\). The length of paper required is \\( \\frac{145}{0.5} = 290 \\, \\text{m} \\), and the total cost is \\( 2 \\times 290 = 580 \\, \\text{Rs} \\), which does not match the given cost of 260 Rs. This discrepancy suggests an alternative interpretation of the semi-perimeter is needed.\n\n7. **Final Interpretation**:  \n   If the semi-perimeter is interpreted as \\( s = l + w \\), the height \\( h = 4 \\, \\text{m} \\) satisfies the ratio \\( h/s = 2/5 \\) and aligns with the provided options. Thus, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: C**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the height of a room given some specific conditions. Alright, let's break it down.\n\nSo, the first part says the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. Wait, semi-perimeter of what? Oh right, in a room, the walls are like a rectangular prism, so the semi-perimeter would be half the perimeter of the floor or ceiling. But wait, the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + width). So the semi-perimeter would be (length + width). Oh right, because if the perimeter is 2(L + W), then semi-perimeter is (L + W).\n\nSo, the ratio of height (h) to semi-perimeter (s) is 2:5. So, h/s = 2/5. Which means h = (2/5) * s. Alternatively, s = (5/2) * h. I'll keep that in mind.\n\nNext part: It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls with paper 50 cm wide at Rs.2 per meter. Also, they allowed an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. So, the cost is based on the area of the walls minus the doors and windows.\n\nWait, let's think about the cost. The paper's width is 50 cm, which is 0.5 meters. The cost per meter is Rs.2, so for each meter of the paper, it costs 2 Rs. So, the total cost is based on the area of paper used.\n\nWait, no. The cost is calculated as (amount of paper used) * (cost per meter). Because the paper is sold by the meter, I think. So, the area of the paper used would be length * width. But the paper's width is 0.5 m, so for each meter of length, the area is 0.5 m\u00b2. So, if you buy x meters of paper, the area is x * 0.5 m\u00b2.\n\nWait, but how much paper is needed? Let's think. The walls have a certain area. The total area to be papered is the sum of the areas of all four walls, minus the doors and windows. Let me denote that as A.\n\nBut wait, the area of the walls is 2*(h*L + h*W) = 2h(L + W) = 2h*s, since s is L + W. Because s is semi-perimeter, which is L + W. So the area of the walls is 2h*s.\n\nBut then, the papered area is (2h*s) - 15, since they subtract 15 sq.m for doors and windows.\n\nWait, no. The problem states that an area of 15 sq.m is allowed for doors and windows. So the paper covers (total wall area - 15) sq.m.\n\nSo, the area of paper used is (2h*s - 15) sq.m.\n\nBut the paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 m. So, the length of paper required would be (area needed) / width of paper. So, length = (2h*s -15)/0.5 = 2*(2h*s -15).\n\nWait, let me compute that again. Area = length * width. So, length = area / width. So, length = (2h*s -15) / 0.5 m. That's the same as 2*(2h*s -15) meters.\n\nThe cost is Rs.2 per meter, so total cost is 2 * [2*(2h*s -15)] = 4*(2h*s -15). But the total cost is given as Rs.260. So:\n\n4*(2h*s -15) = 260.\n\nSimplify that:\n\n2h*s -15 = 260 /4 = 65.\n\nSo, 2h*s = 65 +15 =80.\n\nThus, 2h*s =80.\n\nBut from the first part, h = (2/5)*s. So, substitute h into this equation.\n\n2 * (2/5 s) * s =80.\n\nLet's compute that:\n\n(4/5) s\u00b2 =80.\n\nMultiply both sides by 5:\n\n4 s\u00b2 =400.\n\nDivide by 4:\n\ns\u00b2=100.\n\nSo, s=10 m. Because s is semi-perimeter, which is L+W, so it's positive.\n\nNow, since h = (2/5)*s, h= (2/5)*10=4 m.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me retrace.\n\nWe have:\n\nTotal wall area (before subtracting doors) is 2h*s. Because 2h*(L + W) = 2h*s.\n\nSubtract the 15 sq.m for doors: so 2h*s -15 is the area to be covered by paper.\n\nThe paper is 0.5 m wide, so the length needed is (2h*s -15)/0.5 = 2*(2h*s -15) meters.\n\nEach meter of paper costs 2 Rs, so total cost is 2 * [2*(2h*s -15)] = 4*(2h*s -15) =260.\n\nWhich gives 2h*s -15 =65 \u2192 2h*s=80.\n\nBut h= (2/5)s \u2192 2*(2/5 s)*s =80 \u2192 (4/5)s\u00b2=80 \u2192 s\u00b2=100 \u2192 s=10.\n\nSo h= (2/5)*10=4. So h is 4m. So the correct answer should be option C)4m.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)2.6m, B)3.9m, C)4m, D)4.2m, E)4.4m. So yes, C is 4m.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the cost calculation. Did I do that correctly?\n\nThe cost is based on the area of paper used, which is (2h*s -15) sq.m. The paper is 50 cm wide, so each meter of paper is 0.5 m\u00b2. So, the amount of paper needed in meters is (2h*s -15)/0.5 m. Each meter of paper costs 2 Rs, so the cost is 2 * [(2h*s -15)/0.5] = 2 * [2*(2h*s -15)] =4*(2h*s -15). Oh wait, no, wait. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the cost per meter is Rs.2. So, if you buy x meters of paper, the cost is 2*x. The area of paper is x * 0.5 (since 0.5 m wide). So, x = (2h*s -15) / 0.5 = 2*(2h*s -15).\n\nSo, cost is 2 * x = 2 * [2*(2h*s -15)] =4*(2h*s -15) =260. So that's correct.\n\nYes, so the calculation seems right. So the height is 4 m. So the correct option is C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the height of a room given some specific conditions. Alright, let's break it down.\n\nSo, the first part says the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. Wait, semi-perimeter of what? Oh right, in a room, the walls are like a rectangular prism, so the semi-perimeter would be half the perimeter of the floor or ceiling. But wait, the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + width). So the semi-perimeter would be (length + width). Oh right, because if the perimeter is 2(L + W), then semi-perimeter is (L + W).\n\nSo, the ratio of height (h) to semi-perimeter (s) is 2:5. So, h/s = 2/5. Which means h = (2/5) * s. Alternatively, s = (5/2) * h. I'll keep that in mind.\n\nNext part: It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls with paper 50 cm wide at Rs.2 per meter. Also, they allowed an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. So, the cost is based on the area of the walls minus the doors and windows.\n\nWait, let's think about the cost. The paper's width is 50 cm, which is 0.5 meters. The cost per meter is Rs.2, so for each meter of the paper, it costs 2 Rs. So, the total cost is based on the area of paper used.\n\nWait, no. The cost is calculated as (amount of paper used) * (cost per meter). Because the paper is sold by the meter, I think. So, the area of the paper used would be length * width. But the paper's width is 0.5 m, so for each meter of length, the area is 0.5 m\u00b2. So, if you buy x meters of paper, the area is x * 0.5 m\u00b2.\n\nWait, but how much paper is needed? Let's think. The walls have a certain area. The total area to be papered is the sum of the areas of all four walls, minus the doors and windows. Let me denote that as A.\n\nBut wait, the area of the walls is 2*(h*L + h*W) = 2h(L + W) = 2h*s, since s is L + W. Because s is semi-perimeter, which is L + W. So the area of the walls is 2h*s.\n\nBut then, the papered area is (2h*s) - 15, since they subtract 15 sq.m for doors and windows.\n\nWait, no. The problem states that an area of 15 sq.m is allowed for doors and windows. So the paper covers (total wall area - 15) sq.m.\n\nSo, the area of paper used is (2h*s - 15) sq.m.\n\nBut the paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 m. So, the length of paper required would be (area needed) / width of paper. So, length = (2h*s -15)/0.5 = 2*(2h*s -15).\n\nWait, let me compute that again. Area = length * width. So, length = area / width. So, length = (2h*s -15) / 0.5 m. That's the same as 2*(2h*s -15) meters.\n\nThe cost is Rs.2 per meter, so total cost is 2 * [2*(2h*s -15)] = 4*(2h*s -15). But the total cost is given as Rs.260. So:\n\n4*(2h*s -15) = 260.\n\nSimplify that:\n\n2h*s -15 = 260 /4 = 65.\n\nSo, 2h*s = 65 +15 =80.\n\nThus, 2h*s =80.\n\nBut from the first part, h = (2/5)*s. So, substitute h into this equation.\n\n2 * (2/5 s) * s =80.\n\nLet's compute that:\n\n(4/5) s\u00b2 =80.\n\nMultiply both sides by 5:\n\n4 s\u00b2 =400.\n\nDivide by 4:\n\ns\u00b2=100.\n\nSo, s=10 m. Because s is semi-perimeter, which is L+W, so it's positive.\n\nNow, since h = (2/5)*s, h= (2/5)*10=4 m.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me retrace.\n\nWe have:\n\nTotal wall area (before subtracting doors) is 2h*s. Because 2h*(L + W) = 2h*s.\n\nSubtract the 15 sq.m for doors: so 2h*s -15 is the area to be covered by paper.\n\nThe paper is 0.5 m wide, so the length needed is (2h*s -15)/0.5 = 2*(2h*s -15) meters.\n\nEach meter of paper costs 2 Rs, so total cost is 2 * [2*(2h*s -15)] = 4*(2h*s -15) =260.\n\nWhich gives 2h*s -15 =65 \u2192 2h*s=80.\n\nBut h= (2/5)s \u2192 2*(2/5 s)*s =80 \u2192 (4/5)s\u00b2=80 \u2192 s\u00b2=100 \u2192 s=10.\n\nSo h= (2/5)*10=4. So h is 4m. So the correct answer should be option C)4m.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)2.6m, B)3.9m, C)4m, D)4.2m, E)4.4m.

Each meter of paper costs 2 Rs, so the cost is 2 * [(2h*s -15)/0.5] = 2 * [2*(2h*s -15)] =4*(2h*s -15). Oh wait, no, wait. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the cost per meter is Rs.2. So, if you buy x meters of paper, the cost is 2*x. The area of paper is x * 0.5 (since 0.5 m wide). So, x = (2h*s -15) / 0.5 = 2*(2h*s -15).\n\nSo, cost is 2 * x = 2 * [2*(2h*s -15)] =4*(2h*s -15) =260. So that's correct.\n\nYes, so the calculation seems right. So the height is 4 m.

I need to find the height of the room.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. First, let's understand what each part means.\n\nThe height to semi-perimeter ratio is 2:5. Wait, the semi-perimeter of what? Oh, probably the semi-perimeter of the floor, which is a rectangle. So the semi-perimeter would be (length + width)/2. Or wait, no, semi-perimeter is (2*(l + w))/2, which is (l + w). So semi-perimeter S = l + w.\n\nSo the ratio is height (h) : (l + w) = 2:5. So h/(l + w) = 2/5. Therefore, h = (2/5)*(l + w). I'll note that down.\n\nNext part: The cost to paper the walls is Rs.260. The paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters. The cost is Rs.2 per meter. So, I think I can find the total area of paper used, then relate that to the area of the walls.\n\nBut wait, the area of the walls is the lateral surface area of the room. So that's 2*(h*l + h*w) = 2h(l + w). Because the walls consist of two pairs of l and w dimensions, each multiplied by the height.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that 15 sq.m is allowed for doors and windows. So the actual area of the paper used is the wall area minus 15.\n\nWait, but when calculating the paper required, do we subtract the area of doors and windows before or after? Hmm, I think the paper covers the walls, so the area of the paper would be equal to the wall area minus the doors and windows. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think.\n\nThe problem states that the cost is Rs.260 for papering the walls, allowing 15 sq.m for doors and windows. So, I think the calculation would be: the total paper area is the wall area minus 15, because those areas are subtracted. So, the paper used is (2h(l + w) - 15) sq.m.\n\nBut wait, the paper is being used to cover the walls, so perhaps the paper's area is equal to the wall area minus the doors and windows. So yes, the paper area would be (2h(l + w) -15).\n\nBut wait, no. Wait, when you paper the walls, you don't subtract the area of doors and windows from the paper you use. Because the paper is just the material, so the area of the paper should be equal to the wall area minus the doors and windows. Because you're not covering the doors and windows with paper. So the area of the paper needed is (2h(l + w) - 15).\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's that the total paper cost is calculated assuming that the doors and windows are already subtracted. So the paper's cost is based on the actual area that is covered, which is walls minus doors and windows. So that makes sense.\n\nSo, the area of paper used is 2h(l + w) - 15.\n\nNow, the paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters. The cost is Rs.2 per meter of paper. So, to find the cost, I need to know how much paper is used in terms of length and width.\n\nWait, the paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters in width. So, the area of the paper is length * width. The length here would be the total length of the paper unrolled, but the width is 0.5 m.\n\nWait, no. The paper is 50 cm wide, so when you unroll it, the area of the paper is (length in meters) * 0.5 m. So, if you use L meters of paper, the area is L * 0.5.\n\nThe cost is Rs.2 per meter of paper. So, the cost would be 2 * L, where L is the length in meters. Because each meter of paper costs Rs.2.\n\nSo, the cost is Rs.260. So, 2 * L = 260 \u2192 L = 130 meters.\n\nSo, the area of the paper is L * 0.5 m = 130 * 0.5 = 65 m\u00b2.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the paper area is equal to 2h(l + w) -15. So,\n\n2h(l + w) -15 = 65.\n\nSo, 2h(l + w) = 65 +15 =80.\n\nHmm, 2h(l + w) =80 \u2192 h(l +w)=40.\n\nBut earlier, from the ratio, we have h = (2/5)(l + w). Because h/(l + w) = 2/5 \u2192 h = (2/5)(l +w).\n\nSo substituting h into the equation: (2/5)(l +w) * (l +w) ) =40 \u2192 (2/5)(l +w)^2 =40.\n\nMultiply both sides by 5: 2(l +w)^2 = 200 \u2192 (l +w)^2 =100 \u2192 l +w=10.\n\nSo, l + w=10.\n\nThen, h = (2/5)*10 =4 meters.\n\nSo the height is 4 meters, which is option C.\n\nWait, let me double-check.\n\nWe have l + w=10. So h=4.\n\nThen, 2h(l +w)=2*4*10=80. So 80 = 2h(l +w), which is correct.\n\nThen, 2h(l +w) -15=80-15=65, which is the area of the paper used.\n\nWhich matches the calculation from the cost. So, the paper area is 65 m\u00b2, which comes from 130 meters of paper at 0.5 m wide (130*0.5=65). And the cost is 130 * 2 = Rs.260, which matches.\n\nSo the height is 4 m, which is option C.\n",

Let me think.\n\nThe problem states that the cost is Rs.260 for papering the walls, allowing 15 sq.m for doors and windows. So, I think the calculation would be: the total paper area is the wall area minus 15, because those areas are subtracted. So, the paper used is (2h(l + w) - 15) sq.m.\n\nBut wait, the paper is being used to cover the walls, so perhaps the paper's area is equal to the wall area minus the doors and windows. So yes, the paper area would be (2h(l + w) -15).\n\nBut wait, no. Wait, when you paper the walls, you don't subtract the area of doors and windows from the paper you use. Because the paper is just the material, so the area of the paper should be equal to the wall area minus the doors and windows. Because you're not covering the doors and windows with paper. So the area of the paper needed is (2h(l + w) - 15).\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's that the total paper cost is calculated assuming that the doors and windows are already subtracted. So the paper's cost is based on the actual area that is covered, which is walls minus doors and windows. So that makes sense.\n\nSo, the area of paper used is 2h(l + w) - 15.\n\nNow, the paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters. The cost is Rs.2 per meter of paper. So, to find the cost, I need to know how much paper is used in terms of length and width.\n\nWait, the paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters in width. So, the area of the paper is length * width. The length here would be the total length of the paper unrolled, but the width is 0.5 m.\n\nWait, no. The paper is 50 cm wide, so when you unroll it, the area of the paper is (length in meters) * 0.5 m. So, if you use L meters of paper, the area is L * 0.5.\n\nThe cost is Rs.2 per meter of paper. So, the cost would be 2 * L, where L is the length in meters. Because each meter of paper costs Rs.2.\n\nSo, the cost is Rs.260. So, 2 * L = 260 \u2192 L = 130 meters.\n\nSo, the area of the paper is L * 0.5 m = 130 * 0.5 = 65 m\u00b2.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the paper area is equal to 2h(l + w) -15. So,\n\n2h(l + w) -15 = 65.\n\nSo, 2h(l + w) = 65 +15 =80.\n\nHmm, 2h(l + w) =80 \u2192 h(l +w)=40.\n\nBut earlier, from the ratio, we have h = (2/5)(l + w). Because h/(l + w) = 2/5 \u2192 h = (2/5)(l +w).\n\nSo substituting h into the equation: (2/5)(l +w) * (l +w) ) =40 \u2192 (2/5)(l +w)^2 =40.\n\nMultiply both sides by 5: 2(l +w)^2 = 200 \u2192 (l +w)^2 =100 \u2192 l +w=10.\n\nSo, l + w=10.\n\nThen, h = (2/5)*10 =4 meters.\n\nSo the height is 4 meters, which is option C.\n\nWait, let me double-check.\n\nWe have l + w=10. So h=4.\n\nThen, 2h(l +w)=2*4*10=80. So 80 = 2h(l +w), which is correct.\n\nThen, 2h(l +w) -15=80-15=65, which is the area of the paper used.\n\nWhich matches the calculation from the cost. So, the paper area is 65 m\u00b2, which comes from 130 meters of paper at 0.5 m wide (130*0.5=65). And the cost is 130 * 2 = Rs.260, which matches.\n\nSo the height is 4 m, which is option C.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the height of a room given the ratio of height to semi-perimeter (2:5) and the cost of papering the walls. Here's the analysis:\n\n1. **Ratio of Height to Semi-Perimeter**:  \n   The semi-perimeter of the floor (a rectangle) is \\( l + w \\), where \\( l \\) is the length and \\( w \\) is the width. The ratio of height (\\( h \\)) to semi-perimeter is \\( 2:5 \\), so:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{h}{l + w} = \\frac{2}{5} \\implies h = \\frac{2}{5}(l + w).\n   \\]\n\n2. **Cost of Papering Walls**:  \n   The cost to paper the walls is Rs.260, with paper 50 cm (0.5 m) wide and Rs.2 per meter. The total length of paper used is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Length of paper} = \\frac{\\text{Cost}}{\\text{Cost per meter}} = \\frac{260}{2} = 130 \\, \\text{m}.\n   \\]  \n   The area of the paper is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of paper} = \\text{Length} \\times \\text{Width} = 130 \\times 0.5 = 65 \\, \\text{m}^2.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Area of Walls**:  \n   The area of the walls is the lateral surface area of the room:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of walls} = 2h(l + w).\n   \\]  \n   Since 15 m\u00b2 is allowed for doors and windows, the paper area is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Paper area} = \\text{Wall area} - \\text{Area for doors and windows}.\n   \\]  \n   Substituting:  \n   \\[\n   2h(l + w) - 15 = 65 \\implies 2h(l + w) = 80.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( l + w \\)**:  \n   From the ratio \\( h = \\frac{2}{5}(l + w) \\), substitute into \\( 2h(l + w) = 80 \\):  \n   \\[\n   2 \\cdot \\frac{2}{5}(l + w) \\cdot (l + w) = 80 \\implies \\frac{4}{5}(l + w)^2 = 80.\n   \\]  \n   Multiply through by 5:  \n   \\[\n   4(l + w)^2 = 400 \\implies (l + w)^2 = 100 \\implies l + w = 10.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Find Height**:  \n   Using \\( h = \\frac{2}{5}(l + w) \\):  \n   \\[\n   h = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 10 = 4 \\, \\text{m}.\n   \\]\n\nThus, the height of the room is **4 meters**, corresponding to option **C**.\n\nAnswer: C",

I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of problems, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. Wait, semi-perimeter... Oh right, semi-perimeter is half the perimeter. So, if the room is rectangular, the perimeter is 2*(length + width). So the semi-perimeter would be (length + width). So the ratio of height to (length + width) is 2:5. Let me note that down: H / (L + W) = 2/5. So, H = (2/5)(L + W). Got it.\n\nNext part of the problem is about the cost to paper the walls. It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls. The paper is 50cm wide and costs Rs.2 per meter. Also, they've allowed an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. So, I need to calculate the total area of the walls and subtract the area for doors and windows, then relate that to the cost.\n\nWait, papering the walls would involve the lateral surface area, right? So the area of the walls is the perimeter of the room multiplied by the height. But wait, the perimeter is 2*(L + W), but since we have four walls, each pair has length and width. So the total wall area (excluding doors and windows) would be 2*(L + W)*H. But wait, no, the area is just 2*(L + W)*H. Because each wall has area L*H and W*H, so two of each, so 2LH + 2WH = 2H(L + W). Oh, right, that's the same as 2H*(L + W). Wait, but the semi-perimeter is (L + W), so 2H*(L + W) is 2H * S, where S is the semi-perimeter. But earlier, the ratio was H/S = 2/5, so H = (2/5)S. So substituting that, 2*(2/5 S) * S = (4/5)S\u00b2. So the wall area is (4/5)S\u00b2. But wait, the doors and windows take up 15 sq.m, so the actual area of paper used is (4/5 S\u00b2) -15.\n\nBut wait, the problem says it costs Rs.260. So I need to find out how much paper was bought. The cost is area of paper times the price per meter. Wait, the paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters. So the area of paper used would be length of paper * width. But the cost is Rs.2 per meter of paper. So, let me think: the cost is based on the length of paper bought, not the area. Because the price is per meter of the paper's length.\n\nSo, the cost would be (length of paper in meters) * Rs.2. So, the total cost is 260 Rs, so 260 = 2 * length. So length of paper is 260 /2 = 130 meters. Wait, that makes sense because the cost per meter is Rs.2, so for 130 meters, it's 2*130=260.\n\nBut the area of the paper used is length * width. The width is 50 cm, which is 0.5 meters. So area of paper is 130 m * 0.5 m = 65 sq.m.\n\nBut this area (65 sq.m) is equal to the wall area minus the doors and windows. Because the paper covers the walls except for 15 sq.m. So:\n\nWall area (excluding doors and windows) = 65 sq.m.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the total area of the paper is 65 sq.m, which covers the walls minus the doors and windows. So, the area of the walls (before subtracting doors) is 65 +15 = 80 sq.m.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me think again. The paper is used to cover the walls, but doors and windows are subtracted. So, the paper's area is equal to the wall area minus the doors and windows. So, paper area = (2*(L+W)*H) - 15. So, 65 = (2*(L+W)*H) -15. Therefore, 2*(L+W)*H = 80.\n\nBut 2*(L+W) is the perimeter, which is 2S (since S is the semi-perimeter, which is L+W). So, 2S * H = 80.\n\nWait, but earlier, H = (2/5) S. So substituting that in:\n\n2S * (2/5 S) = 80.\n\nSo that's (4/5) S\u00b2 = 80.\n\nMultiply both sides by 5: 4 S\u00b2 = 400.\n\nDivide by 4: S\u00b2 = 100.\n\nTake square root: S = 10 meters.\n\nSo the semi-perimeter is 10 m. That means L + W = 10 m.\n\nThen, H = (2/5)*10 = 4 meters.\n\nWait, so the height is 4 meters. Let me check the options. Option C is 4m. So the answer would be C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, the ratio H/S = 2/5. So H = (2/5) S.\n\nThe cost is Rs.260, which is for paper that's 0.5m wide. The cost per meter is Rs.2, so length is 260/2=130m.\n\nArea of paper is 130m *0.5m=65 sq.m.\n\nThis area is equal to the wall area (2*(L+W)*H) minus 15 sq.m.\n\nSo 2*(L+W)*H -15 =65 \u2192 2*(L+W)*H=80.\n\nBut 2*(L+W) is 2S. So 2S * H =80.\n\nSubstituting H= (2/5) S, we get 2S*(2/5 S)= (4/5) S\u00b2=80.\n\nS\u00b2=80*(5/4)=100 \u2192 S=10.\n\nSo H= (2/5)*10=4 m. Yep, that seems correct.\n",

I'm a bit rusty on these types of problems, but I'll think it through.\n\nSo, the problem states that the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. Wait, semi-perimeter? Oh right, semi-perimeter is half the perimeter. So, if the room is a rectangle, the perimeter is 2*(length + width), so semi-perimeter would be length + width. So the ratio is height : (length + width) = 2:5. Let me note that down.\n\nNext part: It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls. The paper is 50cm wide, costs Rs.2 per meter. And they allow for 15 sq.m for doors and windows. So, the cost is based on the area of the walls minus the doors and windows.\n\nWait, papering the walls means we're calculating the lateral surface area, right? So, the area of the walls (excluding the floor and ceiling) is what we're looking at. But then, we have to subtract the area of doors and windows, which is 15 sq.m.\n\nLet me jot down the given data:\n\n- Cost of papering = Rs.260.\n- Paper width = 50 cm = 0.5 meters.\n- Paper cost = Rs.2 per meter.\n- Area of doors and windows = 15 sq.m.\n- Height (h) : semi-perimeter (s) = 2:5 \u2192 h/s = 2/5 \u2192 s = (5/2)h.\n\nWe need to find h.\n\nFirst, let's find the area of the walls. The walls' area (excluding doors and windows) is the cost calculation minus the 15 sq.m.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the total area papered is the area of the walls minus the doors and windows. Because doors and windows aren't covered. So, the area of the walls (excluding doors and windows) is what's being covered by the paper.\n\nSo, the area of the walls (without doors and windows) is equal to the cost of papering plus the area of doors and windows? Or wait, no, the papering doesn't cover the doors, so the area of the walls that's papered is (total wall area) - 15. So, the area of the walls that's being covered by the paper is (2*(length + width)*h) - 15.\n\nWait, no, the total area of the walls is 2*(l + w)*h. Then, we subtract the 15 sq.m for doors and windows. So, the papered area is 2*(l + w)*h -15.\n\nBut wait, the cost is based on how much paper is used, which is the area of the paper. The paper has a certain width and is bought in meters. So, the amount of paper used is (area of paper) = length of paper * width of paper. Wait, no, actually, the area of the paper would be the length (in meters) multiplied by the width (in meters). Since the paper is 50 cm wide, that's 0.5 meters. So, for each meter of paper, the area is 1m * 0.5m = 0.5 sq.m. So, the total area of the paper used is (length of paper in meters) * 0.5.\n\nBut the cost is Rs.2 per meter of paper. So, the cost is 2 * (length of paper in meters). Because you pay per meter of the paper's length, not area.\n\nSo, the cost is Rs.260. So, 2 * (length of paper in meters) = 260 \u2192 length of paper in meters is 260 / 2 = 130 meters.\n\nThe area of the paper is 130 m * 0.5 m = 65 sq.m.\n\nBut wait, the area of the paper must equal the area of the walls that are being covered, which is (2*(l + w)*h) - 15.

      "full_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. Hmm, so the question is about finding the height of a room given some conditions. I'm a bit rusty on these types of problems, but I'll think it through.\n\nSo, the problem states that the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. Wait, semi-perimeter? Oh right, semi-perimeter is half the perimeter. So, if the room is a rectangle, the perimeter is 2*(length + width), so semi-perimeter would be length + width. So the ratio is height : (length + width) = 2:5. Let me note that down.\n\nNext part: It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls. The paper is 50cm wide, costs Rs.2 per meter. And they allow for 15 sq.m for doors and windows. So, the cost is based on the area of the walls minus the doors and windows.\n\nWait, papering the walls means we're calculating the lateral surface area, right? So, the area of the walls (excluding the floor and ceiling) is what we're looking at. But then, we have to subtract the area of doors and windows, which is 15 sq.m.\n\nLet me jot down the given data:\n\n- Cost of papering = Rs.260.\n- Paper width = 50 cm = 0.5 meters.\n- Paper cost = Rs.2 per meter.\n- Area of doors and windows = 15 sq.m.\n- Height (h) : semi-perimeter (s) = 2:5 \u2192 h/s = 2/5 \u2192 s = (5/2)h.\n\nWe need to find h.\n\nFirst, let's find the area of the walls. The walls' area (excluding doors and windows) is the cost calculation minus the 15 sq.m.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the total area papered is the area of the walls minus the doors and windows. Because doors and windows aren't covered. So, the area of the walls (excluding doors and windows) is what's being covered by the paper.\n\nSo, the area of the walls (without doors and windows) is equal to the cost of papering plus the area of doors and windows? Or wait, no, the papering doesn't cover the doors, so the area of the walls that's papered is (total wall area) - 15. So, the area of the walls that's being covered by the paper is (2*(length + width)*h) - 15.\n\nWait, no, the total area of the walls is 2*(l + w)*h. Then, we subtract the 15 sq.m for doors and windows. So, the papered area is 2*(l + w)*h -15.\n\nBut wait, the cost is based on how much paper is used, which is the area of the paper. The paper has a certain width and is bought in meters. So, the amount of paper used is (area of paper) = length of paper * width of paper. Wait, no, actually, the area of the paper would be the length (in meters) multiplied by the width (in meters). Since the paper is 50 cm wide, that's 0.5 meters. So, for each meter of paper, the area is 1m * 0.5m = 0.5 sq.m. So, the total area of the paper used is (length of paper in meters) * 0.5.\n\nBut the cost is Rs.2 per meter of paper. So, the cost is 2 * (length of paper in meters). Because you pay per meter of the paper's length, not area.\n\nSo, the cost is Rs.260. So, 2 * (length of paper in meters) = 260 \u2192 length of paper in meters is 260 / 2 = 130 meters.\n\nThe area of the paper is 130 m * 0.5 m = 65 sq.m.\n\nBut wait, the area of the paper must equal the area of the walls that are being covered, which is (2*(l + w)*h) - 15. Because the doors and windows aren't covered.\n\nSo, 2*(l + w)*h -15 = 65 \u2192 2*(l + w)*h = 80 \u2192 (l + w)*h =40.\n\nWait, but (l + w) is the semi-perimeter, right? Because perimeter is 2*(l + w), so semi-perimeter is l + w. So, from the ratio, h / s = 2/5 \u2192 s = (5/2) h.\n\nSo, s = (5/2) h \u2192 (l + w) = (5/2) h.\n\nSubstituting into the earlier equation: (5/2 h) * h = 40 \u2192 (5/2) h\u00b2 = 40 \u2192 h\u00b2 = (40 * 2)/5 \u2192 h\u00b2 = 16 \u2192 h = 4 meters.

Also, they allowed an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. I need to find the height.\n\nWait, so the cost is related to the area of the paper used. Let me think about that. The total cost is the area of the paper multiplied by the cost per meter. Or wait, no, the paper is sold at Rs.2 per meter. Wait, but paper is usually sold by the length, but here it's given as 50cm wide. So I think the cost would depend on how much paper is used, which relates to the area of the walls minus doors and windows.\n\nWait, let me break it down. The cost is Rs.260. The paper is 50 cm wide, and the cost is Rs.2 per meter. So first, I need to find the area of the paper used, then relate that to the walls' area.\n\nWait, the area of the paper used would be the length of the paper multiplied by its width. But the paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters. So if the length of the paper is L meters, then the area of the paper is L * 0.5 m\u00b2.\n\nBut the cost is Rs.2 per meter of paper. So the cost would be 2 * L, because cost is per meter of the paper's length. So the total cost is 2 * L = 260 Rs. So solving for L, L = 260 / 2 = 130 meters. Wait, that seems really long. But okay, maybe that's correct.\n\nSo the area of the paper used is L * width = 130 m * 0.5 m = 65 m\u00b2. But wait, that's the area of the paper. However, this is the area used to cover the walls, but they allowed for 15 sq.m for doors and windows.

So:\n\nTotal wall area = 65 + 15 = 80 m\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. If the paper covers the walls, but the doors and windows are not covered. So the paper area is the same as the wall area minus the doors and windows. So:\n\nPaper area = (2*(length + width)*height) - 15 = 65 m\u00b2.\n\nBecause the walls of a room are two pairs of length and width, each pair having height.

The paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 m. The cost is Rs.2 per meter. So how much paper (in meters) were bought?\n\nThe cost is Rs.2 per meter of paper. So the total length bought is 260 / 2 = 130 meters.\n\nSo the area of the paper is 130 m * 0.5 m = 65 m\u00b2.\n\nBut this area is used to cover the walls, excluding 15 m\u00b2 for doors and windows.\n\nSo the actual wall area is 65 +15 =80 m\u00b2.\n\nThe wall area is 2*(l +w)*h =80.\n\nBut from the ratio, h/(l +w) = 2/5.\n\nSo h = (2/5)*(l +w).\n\nLet me let (l +w) =5x, so h=2x.\n\nSubstituting into wall area:\n\n2*(5x)*(2x) =80.\n\nWhich is 2*5x*2x=20x\u00b2=80.\n\nx\u00b2=4, x=2.\n\nSo h=2x=4 m.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 4 m.

So the semi-perimeter would be length + width. Oh wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Wait, the perimeter is the sum of all sides, so for a rectangle, it's 2*(l + w). So semi-perimeter would be (2*(l + w))/2, which is l + w. Oh, right, so semi-perimeter is l + w.\n\nSo the height (h) to semi-perimeter (s) ratio is 2:5. So h/s = 2/5. So h = (2/5)*s. So s = h*(5/2).\n\nNext part: It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls. The paper is 50cm wide, and costs Rs.2 per meter. Also, they allow an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. So we're told to subtract that 15 from the total wall area.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think about how to calculate the cost. The cost is based on the area of the paper used. So the area of the paper needed is equal to the total wall area minus the 15 sq.m for doors and windows.\n\nWait, but the paper has a certain width, so the length of paper needed is the area divided by the width. Hmm.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Calculate the area of the four walls. The area is 2*(length + width)*height. But wait, no, that's the lateral surface area. So 2*(l + w)*h. But we have to subtract 15 sq.m for doors and windows, so the papered area is (2*(l + w)*h) - 15.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the cost is for the paper used, which is for the walls. So the paper covers the area of the walls minus the doors and windows. So the paper's area is (total wall area) minus (15). So paper area = 2*(l + w)*h - 15.\n\nBut the paper is sold in rolls of a certain width and length. The cost depends on how much paper is used, which is the area. So the cost is (paper area) multiplied by the price per square meter? Wait, no, the price is Rs.2 per meter of the paper. Wait, but the paper is 50 cm wide, so the area of the paper is width * length. So the cost is (length of paper in meters) multiplied by Rs.2 per meter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cost is calculated based on the area of the paper, but since the price is per meter of length (since it's a roll), but you have to know how much you use. Hmm, maybe I should model this correctly.\n\nLet me think: The paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters. So when you buy the paper, the area you're purchasing is 0.5 m (width) multiplied by the length in meters. The cost is Rs.2 per meter of the roll, meaning per linear meter of length.\n\nSo the cost is (length of paper in meters) * Rs.2/m. But the area of the paper is 0.5 m * length m = 0.5 * length m\u00b2. So the cost is 2 * length = 2 * (length in meters).\n\nBut the area of the paper used is equal to the area of the walls minus the 15 m\u00b2. So:\n\nPaper area = (2*(l + w)*h) - 15 = 0.5 m * length m.\n\nSo, length = (2*(l + w)*h - 15) / 0.5 = 2*(2*(l + w)*h -15).\n\nWait, no, wait. Let's correct that. The paper area is 0.5 m (width) multiplied by the length (in meters) of the paper. So paper area = 0.5 * length.\n\nBut paper area is also equal to (2*(l + w)*h) - 15.\n\nSo,\n\n0.5 * length = (2*(l + w)*h) - 15.\n\nSo length = [2*(l + w)*h -15 ] / 0.5 = 2*(2*(l + w)*h -15).\n\nWait, no, more accurately:\n\nlength = (2*(l + w)*h -15) / 0.5.\n\nWhich is the same as 2*(2*(l + w)*h -15) ?\n\nWait, let's compute it correctly.\n\nIf 0.5 * length = (2*(l + w)*h -15), then:\n\nlength = (2*(l + w)*h -15) / 0.5.\n\nWhich is the same as 2*(2*(l + w)*h -15).\n\nWait, no, wait: 1/0.5 is 2. So, yes, length = 2*(2*(l +w)*h -15).\n\nWait, no, 2*(l + w)*h is the total wall area, subtracting 15 gives the area covered by the paper. Then, since paper is 0.5m wide, the length is (paper area) / 0.5.\n\nSo, paper area = 0.5 * length.\n\nSo, 0.5 * length = (2*(l +w)*h -15).\n\nSo, length = [ (2*(l +w)*h -15) ] / 0.5.\n\nWhich is 2*(2*(l +w)*h -15).\n\nWait, no: [ (2*(l +w)*h -15) ] / 0.5 is equal to 2*(2*(l +w)*h -15). Because dividing by 0.5 is multiplying by 2.\n\nSo, length = 2*(2*(l +w)*h -15).\n\nNow, the cost is Rs.2 per meter, and the length is in meters. So cost = 2 * length.\n\nSo,\n\nCost = 2 * [2*(2*(l +w)*h -15)].\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, no, cost is 2 * length, because the price is Rs.2 per meter of length. So:\n\nCost = 2 * length.\n\nSo, putting it all together,\n\nCost = 2 * [ (2*(l + w)*h -15) / 0.5 ]\n\nWait, but wait, I think I might have messed up. Let me re-express it.\n\nThe area of the paper needed is (2*(l +w)*h -15) m\u00b2.\n\nThe paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 m. So the length of paper needed is (paper area) / 0.5 m.\n\nSo length = (2*(l +w)*h -15) / 0.5 = 2*(2*(l +w)*h -15).\n\nThen, the cost is Rs.2 per meter of paper. So cost = 2 * length.\n\nSo,\n\nCost = 2 * [ 2*(2*(l +w)*h -15) ].\n\nWait, that seems high, but let's plug in the numbers.\n\nGiven that the cost is Rs.260, so:\n\n260 = 2 * [ 2*(2*(l +w)*h -15) ]\n\nWait, let's compute the right-hand side.\n\nWait, 2*(2*(l +w)*h -15) is the length. Then, multiply by 2 (since cost is Rs.2 per meter) gives 4*(2*(l +w)*h -15) = 260.\n\nWait, but 4*(2*(l +w)*h -15) = 260.\n\nSo, 4*(2*(l +w)*h -15) = 260.\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n2*(l +w)*h -15 = 65.\n\nSo,\n\n2*(l +w)*h = 65 +15 = 80.\n\nSo,\n\n(l +w)*h = 40.\n\nBut earlier, we have that the semi-perimeter s = l +w = (5/2)*h.\n\nBecause h/s = 2/5 \u2192 s = (5/2) h.\n\nSo,\n\ns = (5/2) h \u2192 l +w = (5/2) h.\n\nSubstituting into (l +w)*h =40:\n\n(5/2 h) * h =40 \u2192 (5/2) h\u00b2 =40.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: 5 h\u00b2 =80 \u2192 h\u00b2=16 \u2192 h=4 m.\n\nWait, because height can't be negative, so h=4 m.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 4 m. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, let me double-check the steps.\n\n1. The ratio h : s is 2:5 \u2192 h/s =2/5 \u2192 s=5h/2.\n\n2. The area of the walls is 2*(l +w)*h = 2*s*h.\n\n3. Subtract 15 m\u00b2 for doors and windows: 2*s*h -15.\n\n4. The paper is 0.5 m wide. So the length of paper needed is (2*s*h -15)/0.5 = 2*(2*s*h -15).\n\n5. Cost is Rs.2 per meter, so cost = 2 * length = 2 * [2*(2*s*h -15)].\n\nWait, but wait: no, the length is (2*s*h -15)/0.5, which is 2*(2*s*h -15). Then, cost is 2 * (length in meters) \u2192 2 * [2*(2*s*h -15)] =4*(2*s*h -15) =260.\n\nSo,\n\n4*(2*s*h -15) =260 \u2192 2*s*h -15=65 \u2192 2*s*h=80 \u2192 s*h=40.\n\nBut s= (5/2) h \u2192 s*h = (5/2)h\u00b2 =40 \u2192 h\u00b2= (40 * 2)/5 =16 \u2192 h=4 m. Yep.\n\nSo the answer is C)4m.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a room's height and semi-perimeter ratio, and calculating the cost of papering the walls. Hmm, let's try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. Wait, semi-perimeter... Wait, semi-perimeter is usually used for polygons, right? Oh, right, for a rectangle, the semi-perimeter would be half of the perimeter.
