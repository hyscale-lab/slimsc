      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to these kinds of problems, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says: Five dozen toys are packed in a box, and 98 boxes are kept in a tempo. How many tempos can lift 29400 toys in one round? The options are A to E, with numbers 4,5,7,6,8.\n\nHmm. Alright, let's break this down. First, I need to find out how many toys each tempo can carry. Then, with the total number of toys, I can figure out how many tempos are needed.\n\nWait, okay, so each box holds five dozen toys. I remember that a dozen is 12, right? So five dozen would be 5 multiplied by 12. Let me calculate that: 5 * 12 = 60. So each box has 60 toys.\n\nNext, each tempo carries 98 boxes. So each tempo can carry 98 boxes, each of which has 60 toys. To find out how many toys one tempo can carry, I multiply 98 by 60.\n\nLet me do that multiplication. 98 * 60. Hmm, 98 times 60. Well, 100 times 60 is 6000, and since it's 98, that's two less. So 6000 - (2*60) = 6000 - 120 = 5880. So each tempo carries 5880 toys in one round.\n\nNow, the total number of toys we need to lift is 29400. So I need to find out how many tempos are required to carry all 29400 toys.\n\nTo do that, I'll divide the total toys by the number each tempo can carry. So 29400 divided by 5880.\n\nWait, let's compute that. 29400 \u00f7 5880. Hmm, maybe simplifying the numbers would help. Both numbers end with a zero, so I can divide numerator and denominator by 10, getting 2940 / 588.\n\nAlternatively, maybe factor both numbers to see if they have common factors. Let me think about 5880 and 29400.\n\nWait, 29400 is exactly 5 times 5880 because 5880 * 5 = 29400. Let me check: 5880 * 5. 5000*5=25000, 880*5=4400; 25000+4400=29400. Yes, exactly. So 29400 /5880 =5.\n\nWait, but wait, that can't be right because 5880 *5 is 29400, so the number of tempos needed is 5? So the answer would be option B, which is 5.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAnother approach: Let's compute 5880 * 5. 5000*5=25000, 880*5=4400, adding them gives 29400. So yes, that's correct. So one tempo carries 5880 toys, and 5 of them carry 29400.\n\nSo the answer is 5. Looking at the options, B is 5. So the correct option is B.\n",

How many tempos can lift 29400 toys in one round?\n\nHmm, I need to find out how many tempos are required to carry 29,400 toys in one trip. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the units. I know a dozen is 12, so five dozen would be 5 times 12. Let me calculate that: 5 * 12 equals 60. So each box holds 60 toys. Got that.\n\nNext, each tempo carries 98 boxes. So, one tempo can carry 98 boxes. Each of those boxes has 60 toys. So to find out how many toys one tempo can carry, I multiply 98 boxes by 60 toys per box. Let me do that math: 98 * 60. Hmm, 98 times 60. Well, 100 times 60 is 6000, minus 2 times 60 which is 120, so 6000 - 120 is 5880. So each tempo can carry 5880 toys in one round.\n\nNow, the total number of toys we need to carry is 29,400.

Let me divide numerator and denominator by 10 to make it simpler: 2940 / 588.\n\nWait, 2940 divided by 588. Let me see, 588 times 5 is 2940, right? Because 500*5=2500, and 88*5=440, so 2500+440=2940.

How many tempos can lift 29400 toys in one round?\n\nHmm, I need to find out how many tempos are required to carry 29,400 toys in one trip. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the units. I know a dozen is 12, so five dozen would be 5 times 12. Let me calculate that: 5 * 12 equals 60. So each box holds 60 toys. Got that.\n\nNext, each tempo carries 98 boxes. So, one tempo can carry 98 boxes. Each of those boxes has 60 toys. So to find out how many toys one tempo can carry, I multiply 98 boxes by 60 toys per box. Let me do that math: 98 * 60. Hmm, 98 times 60. Well, 100 times 60 is 6000, minus 2 times 60 which is 120, so 6000 - 120 is 5880. So each tempo can carry 5880 toys in one round.\n\nNow, the total number of toys we need to carry is 29,400. I need to find out how many tempos are needed to carry all of them. So I'll divide the total toys by the number of toys one tempo can carry.\n\nSo 29,400 divided by 5880. Let me compute that. Let's see, 5880 goes into 29,400 how many times?\n\nHmm, maybe I can simplify this division. Let's see, 29,400 divided by 5880. Let me write this as a fraction: 29400 / 5880. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 10 to make it simpler: 2940 / 588.\n\nWait, 2940 divided by 588. Let me see, 588 times 5 is 2940, right? Because 500*5=2500, and 88*5=440, so 2500+440=2940. Oh, so 588 *5=2940. So 29400 divided by 5880 is 5. So each tempo can carry 5880 toys, and 5 of them would carry 5*5880=29400. So that would mean 5 tempos are needed.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me compute 5880 *5. 5000*5 is 25,000. 880*5 is 4400. 25,000 +4400 is 29,400. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the number of tempos needed is 5. Looking at the options, option B is 5. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Did I calculate the per box toys correctly? Five dozen is 60, correct. 98 boxes per tempo, 60 each, so 98*60=5880. Yep, that's right. And 29400 divided by 5880 is 5. So yeah, 5 tempos. So the answer is option B.\n\n\nTo determine how many tempos are required to lift 29,400 toys in one round, we start by calculating the number of toys each tempo can carry. \n\n1. **Toys per box**: Five dozen toys per box means \\( 5 \\times 12 = 60 \\) toys per box.  \n2. **Toys per tempo**: Each tempo carries 98 boxes, so the number of toys per tempo is \\( 98 \\times 60 = 5880 \\) toys.  \n3. **Number of tempos required**: To carry 29,400 toys, we divide the total number of toys by the number of toys each tempo can carry:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{29,400}{5880} = 5\n   \\]  \nThus, 5 tempos are needed to carry 29,400 toys in one round.\n\nAnswer: B",

Hmm, so a tempo is like a vehicle, maybe a truck or something. Each tempo can carry 98 boxes. Since each box has 60 toys, I need to find out how many toys one tempo can carry in one trip.\n\nWait, so one tempo carries 98 boxes, each with 60 toys. So per tempo, it's 98 multiplied by 60. Let me do that math. 98 * 60. Hmm, 100 times 60 is 6000, so 98 is 2 less. So 2 *60 is 120. So subtract 120 from 6000. 6000 - 120 is 5880.

Since each box has 60 toys, I multiply 98 boxes by 60 toys per box. Let me compute that. 98 times 60. Hmm, 100 times 60 is 6000, minus 2 times 60 which is 120, so 6000 - 120 equals 5880. So one tempo can carry 5,880 toys in one round.\n\nNow, the total number of toys to be lifted is 29,400. I need to find out how many tempos are required to carry all of them. So I should divide the total toys by the number of toys one tempo can carry.\n\nLet me write that as a division problem: 29,400 divided by 5,880. Hmm, let's compute that. Alternatively, maybe I can simplify this fraction.\n\nWait, 29,400 divided by 5,880. Let me see. Both numbers can be divided by 100 first. That gives 294 divided by 58.8. Hmm, that's not the easiest way. Maybe I can find a common factor.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of how many times 5,880 fits into 29,400. Let me try dividing both by 5,880. Alternatively, perhaps I can find how many times 5,880 times 5 is, for example.\n\nWait, 5,880 multiplied by 5: 5,000 *5 is 25,000. 880 *5 is 4,400. So 25,000 +4,400 is 29,400. Oh! So 5,880 times 5 equals exactly 29,400. So that means I need 5 tempos to carry all the toys.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. 5 *5,880 is 29,400? Let me do the multiplication again. 5,880 *5: 5,000 *5=25,000, 800*5=4,000, 80*5=400. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 5,880 is 5,000 + 800 + 80. So 5,000 *5=25,000; 800 *5=4,000; 80*5=400. So adding them: 25,000 +4,000 is 29,000, plus 400 is 29,400. Yep, that's correct. So 5 tempos are needed.\n\nLooking at the options, B is 5. So the answer should be option B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine how many tempos are needed to carry 29,400 toys in one round, we start by calculating the number of toys per box and per tempo.
