      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about oarsmen's weights. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the average weight of 10 oarsmen increases by 1.8 kg when one of them is replaced. The man who was replaced weighed 53 kg. I need to find the weight of the new man.\n\nWait, so initially, there are 10 oarsmen. Their average weight is something, and when one is replaced, the average goes up by 1.8 kg. So the total weight must have increased by 10 times 1.8 kg because average is total divided by the number. Let me think.\n\nRight, the average increase is 1.8 kg for each of the 10 men, so the total increase in weight is 10 * 1.8. Let me calculate that: 10 * 1.8 is 18 kg. So the new total is 18 kg more than the old total.\n\nBut how did that happen? One man left and another came in. So the difference in their weights must be equal to the total increase. Oh, right, because when the new man is heavier, the total weight goes up, which affects the average.\n\nSo, the old man was 53 kg. The new man's weight must be 53 kg plus the total increase. Wait, no. Because when the old man leaves, the total weight decreases by his weight, and the new man adds his weight. So the net change is (new man's weight) minus (old man's weight) equals the total increase.\n\nSo, let me write that as an equation. Let new man's weight be x.\n\nSo, x - 53 kg = 18 kg. Because replacing him adds 18 kg to the total.\n\nWait, because the average increased by 1.8 kg for 10 people: 1.8 *10 =18. So the total weight went up by 18 kg.\n\nSo x = 53 + 18 = 71 kg. Oh, so the new man weighs 71 kg.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 71. So that's the answer.\n",

The average weight of 10 oarsmen increases by 1.8 kg when one of them, who weighs 53 kg, is replaced by a new man. I need to find the weight of the new man. Hmm, okay.\n\nAlright, so there are 10 oarsmen initially. Their average weight is something, and when one is replaced, the average goes up by 1.8 kg. Let me think about how averages work. The average is the total sum divided by the number of people. So, if the average increases, the total sum must have increased as well.\n\nWait, but the number of oarsmen remains the same, right? Because it's just one person being replaced. So the average increases by 1.8 kg for 10 people. So the total increase in weight would be 10 multiplied by 1.8 kg. Let me calculate that. 10 * 1.8 = 18 kg. So the total weight of the crew goes up by 18 kg after the replacement.\n\nNow, the person who was replaced weighed 53 kg. Let's call the new man's weight 'x'. So the change in total weight is (x - 53) kg. Because we're replacing the 53 kg person with someone else. And according to the earlier calculation, this change must be 18 kg. So x - 53 = 18. Solving for x, that would be x = 53 + 18 = 71 kg. Wait, that's option A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me think about the initial and final averages. Let the initial average be A. So the initial total weight is 10*A. After replacing, the average is A + 1.8, so the new total is 10*(A + 1.8). The difference between these totals is 10*(A +1.8) - 10*A = 18 kg. Which is exactly the same as before. So the new person's weight must be 53 + 18 = 71 kg. So the answer should be A)71.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, A is 71. So that's the choice. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Because sometimes when you think you're right but maybe there's a detail I missed.\n\nAnother way to approach it: The average increases by 1.8 kg. So each of the 10 oarsmen contributes an extra 1.8 kg on average. So the total increase is 10 * 1.8 = 18 kg. That's the total weight added to the boat when the new person comes in.

Hmm, the question says that the average weight of 10 oarsmen increases by 1.8 kg when one man is replaced by a new one. The man who was replaced weighs 53 kg. I need to find the weight of the new man.\n\nWait, right, average weight is total weight divided by the number of people. So initially, there are 10 oarsmen. Their total weight must be 10 times the original average. Then, when one is replaced, the total weight changes, and the average increases by 1.8 kg. So the new average is the original average plus 1.8.\n\nLet me think about the variables. Let's say the original average is A. So original total weight is 10A. When the 53 kg man is replaced, the new total becomes (10A - 53 + new man's weight). The new average is (original average + 1.8), so (A + 1.8).\n\nSo the equation would be: (10A -53 + x) / 10 = A + 1.8, where x is the new man's weight.\n\nWait, maybe I can rearrange that equation. Multiply both sides by 10:\n\n10A -53 + x = 10*(A +1.8)\n\nExpanding the right side: 10A + 18.\n\nSo, 10A -53 +x = 10A +18.\n\nHmm, the 10A terms will cancel out on both sides. So:\n\n-53 + x = 18.\n\nAdding 53 to both sides: x = 18 +53 = 71.\n\nWait, so the new man weighs 71 kg? Let me check the options. Option A is 71, so that's the answer.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I do that right? Let me go through it again.\n\nOriginal total weight: 10A.\n\nAfter replacement, total weight is (10A -53 + x).\n\nThe average after replacement is (10A -53 +x)/10 = A +1.8.\n\nMultiply both sides by 10: 10A -53 +x = 10A + 18.\n\nSubtract 10A from both sides: -53 + x = 18. So x=71. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the change in average is 1.8 kg for 10 people, so the total increase in weight is 10 *1.8 = 18 kg. The new man added must have contributed this extra. So the new man's weight is 53 kg (the weight of the replaced man) plus 18 kg, which is 71 kg. Oh right, because replacing a 53 kg person with someone heavier by 18 kg would increase the total by 18, thus increasing the average by 1.8.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the new man is 71 kg.\n",

The average weight of 10 oarsmen increases by 1.8 kg when one of them, who weighs 53 kg, is replaced by a new man. I need to find the weight of this new man. Hmm, let's break it down.\n\nWait, average weight is total weight divided by the number of people. So initially, there are 10 oarsmen. Their total weight would be the average multiplied by 10. But I don't know the initial average. Oh wait, maybe I don't need it directly.\n\nWhen one person is replaced, the total number remains 10. The new average is the old average plus 1.8 kg.

So, the total weight increases by 1.8 *10 = 18 kg.\n\nSo the new man's weight must be more than the person he replaced by 18 kg. Because when you remove someone and add someone else, the difference between their weights is what changes the total. \n\nThe person being replaced weighs 53 kg. So the new man's weight should be 53 kg plus 18 kg. Let me add that: 53 +18 = 71 kg. So the new man is 71 kg. Looking at the options, option A is 71.\n\nWait, but wait another second. Let me think again. The total weight increases by 18 kg. So the new man's weight is the old man's weight plus 18. Yeah, that makes sense. Because if the old man was 53, and the new one is 71, the total goes up by 18. \n\nSo the answer must be A)71.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about oarsmen's weights. Let me read it again. The average weight of 10 oarsmen increases by 1.8 kg when one of them, who weighs 53 kg, is replaced by a new man. I need to find the weight of this new man. Hmm, let's break it down.\n\nWait, average weight is total weight divided by the number of people. So initially, there are 10 oarsmen. Their total weight would be the average multiplied by 10. But I don't know the initial average. Oh wait, maybe I don't need it directly.\n\nWhen one person is replaced, the total number remains 10. The new average is the old average plus 1.8 kg. So, the change in total weight must be 1.8 kg times 10, right? Because average increases by 1.8, and there are 10 people. So, the total weight increases by 1.8 *10 = 18 kg.\n\nSo the new man's weight must be more than the person he replaced by 18 kg. Because when you remove someone and add someone else, the difference between their weights is what changes the total. \n\nThe person being replaced weighs 53 kg.
