      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about population growth in Boomtown. Hmm, let me read it again. The planners expect a 10% increase each year for the next two years. And if that happens, the population in two years will be exactly double what it was one year ago. I need to find the percent increase from the last year. Wait, I'm a bit confused about the timeline here.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's say the current population is P. If there's a 10% increase each year, then next year it'll be P plus 10% of P, which is 1.1P. Then the year after that, another 10% increase, so it'll be 1.1 times the previous year's population. So that would be 1.1 * 1.1P, which is 1.21P. So in two years, the population would be 1.21P.\n\nWait, the problem says that two years from now, the population will be double what it was one year ago. Oh, wait, one year ago from now would be the population before this year's increase. So if the current population is P, then one year ago it was P divided by 1.1, right? Because if last year it was, say, Q, then this year it's Q * 1.1 = P, so Q = P / 1.1.\n\nSo two years from now, the population is 1.21P, and this should be equal to double the population one year ago. So 1.21P = 2 * (P / 1.1). Let me compute that.\n\nLet me set up the equation: 1.21P = 2*(P/1.1). Let's solve for P. Wait, but P isn't zero, so I can divide both sides by P, getting 1.21 = 2/(1.1). Let's check that: 2 divided by 1.1 is approximately 1.818. Wait, but 1.21 is not equal to 1.818. That doesn't make sense. Did I get the timeline right?\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the time references. Let me think again. The problem says that the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. So, if the current time is now, then one year ago was t-1, and two years from now is t+2.\n\nWait, but according to the problem, the planners expect a 10% increase per year for the next two years. So the next two years are from now (t) to t+2. So the population at t+1 is 1.1P, and at t+2 is 1.1^2 P = 1.21 P.\n\nThe population at t+2 is double the population at t-1. So 1.21 P = 2 * (Population at t-1). But Population at t-1 is the population before last year's growth. Let me denote the population at t-1 as Q. Then, the population at t is Q * (1 + x/100), where x is the percentage increase from last year to now.\n\nWait, wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me structure it step by step.\n\nLet me define the current population as P. Then, one year ago, the population was P_prev, and this year it's increased by some percentage, let's say x%, to become P. So P = P_prev * (1 + x/100).\n\nNext year, it's expected to increase by 10%, so next year's population is P * 1.1. Then the year after that, another 10% increase, so 1.1 * (P * 1.1) = 1.21 P.\n\nAccording to the problem, the population in two years (which is 1.21 P) is exactly double the population one year ago (which was P_prev). So 1.21 P = 2 * P_prev.\n\nBut from earlier, P = P_prev * (1 + x/100). So P_prev = P / (1 + x/100).\n\nSubstituting into the previous equation: 1.21 P = 2 * (P / (1 + x/100)).\n\nDivide both sides by P: 1.21 = 2 / (1 + x/100).\n\nMultiply both sides by (1 + x/100): 1.21 (1 + x/100) = 2.\n\nDivide both sides by 1.21: 1 + x/100 = 2 / 1.21.\n\nCompute 2 / 1.21. Let me calculate that. 1.21 is approximately 121/100, so 2 divided by 121/100 is 2 * 100/121 = 200/121 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSo 1 + x/100 \u2248 1.65289. Subtract 1: x/100 \u2248 0.65289. Multiply by 100: x \u2248 65.289%. So the percentage increase from last year is approximately 65.3%.\n\nLooking at the options, D is 65%. So the closest is D.\n",

Hmm, the question says that the population is expected to increase by 10% each year for the next two years. And if that happens, then two years from now, the population will be exactly double what it was one year ago. I need to find the percentage increase in the population over the last year, and choose the closest option from A to E.\n\nWait, wait. Let me make sure I understand the timeline here. The problem talks about projections for the next two years, but the comparison is to one year ago. So I think I need to model the population changes over several years, maybe using variables to represent the current or past populations.\n\nLet me assign some variables. Let's say P is the population one year ago. Then, the population this year (current) would have increased by some percentage, which we're trying to find. Let's call that percentage 'x'. So the current population is P multiplied by (1 + x/100).\n\nNow, according to the problem, the population is expected to grow at 10% per year for the next two years. So next year, it'll be current population times 1.10. The year after that, it'll be that amount times another 1.10.\n\nSo the population two years from now would be P_current * 1.10^2. Substituting P_current as P*(1 + x/100), that becomes P*(1 + x/100)*1.21.\n\nThe problem states that this future population (two years from now) is exactly double the population one year ago. So, that future population equals 2*P.\n\nPutting that together: P*(1 + x/100)*1.21 = 2P.\n\nHmm, I can cancel out the P from both sides since P isn't zero. So that leaves (1 + x/100)*1.21 = 2.\n\nNow, I can solve for (1 + x/100). Dividing both sides by 1.21:\n\n1 + x/100 = 2 / 1.21.\n\nLet me compute 2 divided by 1.21. 1.21 times 1.65 is about 2, because 1.21 * 1.6 = 1.936, and 1.21 * 1.65 = 1.9865, which is close to 2. So 2/1.21 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSo, 1 + x/100 \u2248 1.65289. Subtracting 1 from both sides gives x/100 \u2248 0.65289. Multiplying both sides by 100 gives x \u2248 65.289%.\n\nLooking at the options, D is 65%, which is the closest. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations. Because 1.21 times 1.65289 is 2? Let me compute 1.21 * 1.65289.\n\n1.21 * 1.65 = 1.21 * 1.6 = 1.936, and 1.21 * 0.05 = 0.0605. So 1.936 + 0.0605 = 1.9965. Hmm, that's a bit under 2. So maybe I need a slightly higher multiplier than 1.65. Let me compute 1.21 * 1.65289.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute 2 / 1.21 exactly. Let's see:\n\n1.21 is 121/100. So 2 / (121/100) = 2 * 100/121 = 200/121.\n\nCalculating 200 divided by 121:\n\n121 goes into 200 once, 121. Subtract, 79 left. Bring down a zero: 790. 121 goes into 790 six times (6*121=726). Subtract, 64. Bring down a zero: 640. 121 goes into 640 five times (5*121=605). Subtract, 35. Bring down a zero: 350. 121 goes into 350 two times (242). Subtract, 108. Bring down a zero: 1080. 121 goes into 1080 eight times (968). Subtract, 112. Bring down a zero: 1120. 121 goes into 1120 nine times (1089). Subtract, 31. So the division gives approximately 1.65289256\u2026 So yes, 1.65289 is correct. So 200/121 is about 1.65289.\n\nSo the equation 1 + x/100 = 1.65289 leads to x \u2248 65.289%.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about population growth in Boomtown, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. Let me read through it again and break it down.\n\nThe problem says that the urban planners expect the population to increase by 10% each year over the next two years. So, if that's the case, then two years from now, the population would be double what it was one year ago. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the timeline here. Let me think about it step by step.\n\nWait, wait. So the projection is for the next two years, meaning this year and the year after. But the statement about the population doubling is compared to one year ago. So, one year ago would be the starting point before the 10% increases began. Let me try to model this.\n\nLet's assign some variables to make it clearer. Let's say the population one year ago (which is the starting point) is P. Then, the population increases by 10% each year for the next two years. So, in the first year (this year), the population becomes P plus 10% of P, which is P * 1.10. Then, the next year (the year after), it increases by another 10%, so that would be 1.10 times the previous year's population. So, after two years, the population would be P * 1.10 * 1.10, which is P * (1.1)^2.\n\nWait, but the problem states that after these two years, the population is exactly double what it was one year ago. So, the population two years from now is 2 times the population one year ago. Oh, but wait, one year ago is P. So, the population after two years is 2P.\n\nSo, putting it together: P * (1.1)^2 = 2P.\n\nWait, wait a minute. Let me write that equation again. So, 1.1^2 * P equals 2 * P. So, 1.21 * P = 2 * P. Hmm, but that can't be right because 1.21 is not equal to 2. I must have made a mistake in interpreting the timeline.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me think again. The problem says that the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. So, perhaps the 'one year ago' is before the current projections started. Let me try to draw a timeline.\n\nLet me define the current time as time zero. So, one year ago would be time -1. The next two years are time +1 and time +2. The population projections are for the next two years, so at time +1, it's 10% higher than time zero, and at time +2, another 10% higher than time +1.\n\nBut the problem states that at time +2, the population is double that of time -1 (one year ago). So, population at time +2 is 2 times the population at time -1.\n\nLet me denote the population at time -1 as P. Then, the population at time 0 (current) is P plus some increase. Wait, no, wait. The projections are for the next two years, so from time 0 to time +1, and time +1 to time +2. So, the current population is the starting point, and each year it increases by 10%.\n\nSo, population at time 0 is P0. Then, time +1: P1 = P0 * 1.10. Time +2: P2 = P1 * 1.10 = P0 * (1.10)^2.\n\nBut according to the problem, P2 = 2 * P_minus1. Wait, P_minus1 is one year before time 0, so P_minus1 is P0 divided by 1.10 (assuming a 10% increase from P_minus1 to P0). Because if the population increases by 10% each year, then the previous year's population would be current / 1.10.\n\nWait, no, that's if the increase is 10% from the previous year. So, if time -1 is one year before time 0, then P0 is P_minus1 * 1.10. So, P_minus1 = P0 / 1.10.\n\nThe problem states that P2 (two years from now) is 2 times P_minus1. So, P2 = 2 * P_minus1.\n\nBut P2 is also P0 * (1.10)^2.\n\nSo, substituting P_minus1, we get P0*(1.1)^2 = 2*(P0/1.1).\n\nLet me write that equation:\n\nP0 * (1.1)^2 = 2 * (P0 / 1.1)\n\nHmm. Let's solve for P0. Wait, but P0 is the population at time 0. Let me see if I can cancel P0 from both sides. Assuming P0 is not zero, which it isn't, I can divide both sides by P0.\n\nSo, (1.1)^2 = 2/(1.1)\n\nLet me compute each side. (1.1)^2 is 1.21. 2 divided by 1.1 is approximately 1.81818...\n\nSo, 1.21 = 1.81818? That can't be right. Wait, that would imply 1.21 equals about 1.818, which isn't true. So that suggests I've made a mistake in setting up the equation.\n\nHmm, maybe I messed up the timeline. Let's re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.\" So, the two years from now is time +2. One year ago is time -1. So, P2 = 2 * P_minus1.\n\nBut wait, the projections are for the next two years, so from time 0 to time +2, the population increases by 10% each year. So, P0 is the current population, P1 is next year (time +1), P2 is the year after that (time +2).\n\nSo, P0 is current, P1 = P0 * 1.10, P2 = P1 *1.10 = P0*(1.10)^2.\n\nNow, the problem says P2 = 2 * P_minus1. So, P2 = 2 * P_minus1.\n\nBut P_minus1 is the population one year before current time (time -1). So, the population at time -1 is P_minus1. The population at time 0 is P0, which is P_minus1 * 1.10. Because from time -1 to time 0, it's a 10% increase.\n\nSo, P0 = P_minus1 * 1.10 \u2192 P_minus1 = P0 / 1.10.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: P2 = 2 * (P0 / 1.10).\n\nBut P2 is P0*(1.10)^2. So:\n\nP0*(1.10)^2 = 2 * (P0 / 1.10)\n\nDivide both sides by P0: (1.10)^2 = 2 / 1.10\n\nCompute each side:\n\nLeft side: (1.1)^2 = 1.21\n\nRight side: 2 / 1.1 \u2248 1.81818\n\nSo, 1.21 = 1.81818? That's not correct. So there must be a mistake in my setup.\n\nWait, maybe the problem says that the population two years from now is double that of one year ago. Oh wait, one year ago is the time before the current time. So, perhaps the projections are that after two years, the population is double the population from one year ago, which would be the same as the population two years from now is double the population from one year ago. But in that case, perhaps the two years are in the past?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the timeline. Let me try to think differently.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet P be the population one year ago (time t-1).\n\nThen, the current population (time t) is P * 1.10.\n\nThe population next year (time t+1) is (P *1.10) *1.10 = P*(1.10)^2.\n\nThe year after that (time t+2) is P*(1.10)^3.\n\nBut the problem says that the population two years from now (time t+2) is double the population of one year ago (time t-1). So:\n\nP*(1.10)^3 = 2 * P.\n\nWait, that's possible. So, (1.1)^3 = 2.\n\nLet me compute (1.1)^3. 1.1 *1.1=1.21, then 1.21 *1.1=1.331. So, 1.331 is less than 2. So that's not possible either. So I must be getting the timeline wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the two years are the next two years, meaning from current time (t) to t+1, and t+1 to t+2. So, the population at t+2 is double the population at t-1.\n\nWait, but according to that, then P(t+2) = 2 * P(t-1).\n\nSo, P(t+2) = P(t-1) * (1.10)^3.\n\nSo, P(t-1) * (1.10)^3 = 2 * P(t-1).\n\nDivide both sides by P(t-1), assuming it's not zero, we get (1.10)^3 = 2.\n\nBut 1.1^3 is 1.331, which is less than 2, so that can't be correct. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here.\n\nWait, maybe the initial assumption about the growth rate is wrong. Oh wait, the problem states that the planners expect a 10% increase each year over the next two years. So, perhaps the current population is P, and after two years, it's P*(1.1)^2.\n\nBut the problem says that two years from now, the population is double that of one year ago. One year ago would be the population before the current year started. So, perhaps the current population is P, and one year ago it was P_prev, which is P / 1.10, assuming a 10% increase from P_prev to P.\n\nWait, let me try that. So, current population P. One year ago, it was P_prev = P / 1.10.\n\nAfter two years, population is P * 1.1^2.\n\nAccording to the problem, this equals 2 * P_prev.\n\nSo:\n\nP * (1.1)^2 = 2 * (P / 1.10)\n\nSimplify:\n\n(1.1)^2 = 2 / 1.1\n\nCompute left side: 1.21\n\nRight side: 2/1.1 = approx 1.818.\n\nSo 1.21 = 1.818? That's not correct. So perhaps my entire setup is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the 10% increase is for the next two years, so perhaps the increase is 10% each year, meaning the growth factor is 1.10 per year for two years. So, the population after two years is P * (1.10)^2.\n\nBut the problem states that this is equal to twice the population one year ago. So, one year ago's population is P_prev = P_current / 1.10.\n\nSo, P * (1.10)^2 = 2 * (P / 1.10)\n\nAgain, same equation as before, which leads to 1.21 = 1.818, which isn't possible. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the population increase is not annual but perhaps the two-year growth is 10% each year, meaning a total of 20% increase over two years. But that can't be right because the question says 10% per year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two-year growth is 10% per year, so the population in year one is P *1.1, and year two is P *1.1 *1.1, which is 1.21P.\n\nWait, but the problem says that after two years, the population is double that of one year ago. So, one year ago was P_prev, which is the population before the first year's growth. So, P_prev = P /1.1.\n\nWait, so P_prev = P /1.1.\n\nThen, after two years, P2 = P_prev * (1.1)^2.\n\nWait, because from P_prev, it increases by 10% each year for two years.\n\nSo, P2 = P_prev * (1.1)^2.\n\nBut according to the problem, P2 is 2 * P_prev.\n\nSo, P_prev * (1.1)^2 = 2 * P_prev.\n\nDivide both sides by P_prev, assuming it's non-zero.\n\n(1.1)^2 = 2 \u2192 1.21 = 2? No, that's not correct.\n\nThis suggests that there's a contradiction in the problem statement, which can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in my setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the population two years from now is double the population from two years ago, not one year ago. Let me try that. But the problem says one year ago.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misread the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: \"the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.\"\n\nAh, so two years from now is P2, and one year ago is P_minus1. So P2 = 2 * P_minus1.\n\nBut according to the growth projections, P2 is P0*(1.1)^2.\n\nAnd P_minus1 is P0 / 1.10.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nP0*(1.1)^2 = 2*(P0/1.10)\n\nDivide both sides by P0:\n\n(1.1)^2 = 2/(1.10)\n\nCompute:\n\n1.21 = 2/1.1 \u2192 2/1.1 is approximately 1.818.\n\nSo, 1.21 equals 1.818? No, that's impossible. So, that suggests that the problem is impossible under the given conditions, which can't be right. So, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem isn't about the next two years, but the two years before now. No, the problem states the projections are for the next two years.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the population increase over the last year, not the next. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question is: \"Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year?\"\n\nAh, so the last year, meaning the year before the current year. So, perhaps the problem is that the population increased by x% last year, and the projections for the next two years are 10% each year, leading to the population being double that of one year ago (which is the population before last year's increase).\n\nWait, maybe I need to model the population changes over the past and future.\n\nLet me define the current population as P0. Then, one year ago (time -1), the population was P_minus1 = P0 / (1 + r), where r is the growth rate over the last year.\n\nThe problem states that after two years of 10% growth, the population will be double that of one year ago. So, in two years, the population is P0 * (1.10)^2.\n\nAccording to the problem, this equals 2 * P_minus1.\n\nSo:\n\nP0 * (1.10)^2 = 2 * (P0 / (1 + r))\n\nDivide both sides by P0:\n\n(1.10)^2 = 2/(1 + r)\n\nSo, 1.21 = 2/(1 + r)\n\nSolve for (1 + r):\n\n1 + r = 2 / 1.21 \u2248 1.65289\n\nSo, r \u2248 1.65289 - 1 = 0.65289, which is approximately 65.289%.\n\nSo, the population increased by approximately 65.29% over the last year.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 65%, which is the closest.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about population growth in Boomtown, and I'm trying to figure out the answer.

So, if that's the case, then two years from now, the population would be double what it was one year ago. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the timeline here. Let me think about it step by step.\n\nWait, wait. So the projection is for the next two years, meaning this year and the year after. But the statement about the population doubling is compared to one year ago. So, one year ago would be the starting point before the 10% increases began. Let me try to model this.\n\nLet's assign some variables to make it clearer. Let's say the population one year ago (which is the starting point) is P. Then, the population increases by 10% each year for the next two years. So, in the first year (this year), the population becomes P plus 10% of P, which is P * 1.10. Then, the next year (the year after), it increases by another 10%, so that would be 1.10 times the previous year's population. So, after two years, the population would be P * 1.10 * 1.10, which is P * (1.1)^2.\n\nWait, but the problem states that after these two years, the population is exactly double what it was one year ago. So, the population two years from now is 2 times the population one year ago. Oh, but wait, one year ago is P. So, the population after two years is 2P.\n\nSo, putting it together: P * (1.1)^2 = 2P.\n\nWait, wait a minute. Let me write that equation again. So, 1.1^2 * P equals 2 * P. So, 1.21 * P = 2 * P. Hmm, but that can't be right because 1.21 is not equal to 2. I must have made a mistake in interpreting the timeline.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me think again. The problem says that the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. So, perhaps the 'one year ago' is before the current projections started. Let me try to draw a timeline.\n\nLet me define the current time as time zero. So, one year ago would be time -1. The next two years are time +1 and time +2. The population projections are for the next two years, so at time +1, it's 10% higher than time zero, and at time +2, another 10% higher than time +1.\n\nBut the problem states that at time +2, the population is double that of time -1 (one year ago). So, population at time +2 is 2 times the population at time -1.\n\nLet me denote the population at time -1 as P. Then, the population at time 0 (current) is P plus some increase. Wait, no, wait. The projections are for the next two years, so from time 0 to time +1, and time +1 to time +2. So, the current population is the starting point, and each year it increases by 10%.\n\nSo, population at time 0 is P0. Then, time +1: P1 = P0 * 1.10. Time +2: P2 = P1 * 1.10 = P0 * (1.10)^2.\n\nBut according to the problem, P2 = 2 * P_minus1. Wait, P_minus1 is one year before time 0, so P_minus1 is P0 divided by 1.10 (assuming a 10% increase from P_minus1 to P0). Because if the population increases by 10% each year, then the previous year's population would be current / 1.10.\n\nWait, no, that's if the increase is 10% from the previous year. So, if time -1 is one year before time 0, then P0 is P_minus1 * 1.10. So, P_minus1 = P0 / 1.10.\n\nThe problem states that P2 (two years from now) is 2 times P_minus1. So, P2 = 2 * P_minus1.\n\nBut P2 is also P0 * (1.10)^2.\n\nSo, substituting P_minus1, we get P0*(1.1)^2 = 2*(P0/1.1).\n\nLet me write that equation:\n\nP0 * (1.1)^2 = 2 * (P0 / 1.1)\n\nHmm. Let's solve for P0. Wait, but P0 is the population at time 0. Let me see if I can cancel P0 from both sides. Assuming P0 is not zero, which it isn't, I can divide both sides by P0.\n\nSo, (1.1)^2 = 2/(1.1)\n\nLet me compute each side. (1.1)^2 is 1.21. 2 divided by 1.1 is approximately 1.81818...\n\nSo, 1.21 = 1.81818? That can't be right. Wait, that would imply 1.21 equals about 1.818, which isn't true. So that suggests I've made a mistake in setting up the equation.\n\nHmm, maybe I messed up the timeline. Let's re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.\" So, the two years from now is time +2. One year ago is time -1. So, P2 = 2 * P_minus1.\n\nBut wait, the projections are for the next two years, so from time 0 to time +2, the population increases by 10% each year. So, P0 is the current population, P1 is next year (time +1), P2 is the year after that (time +2).\n\nSo, P0 is current, P1 = P0 * 1.10, P2 = P1 *1.10 = P0*(1.10)^2.\n\nNow, the problem says P2 = 2 * P_minus1. So, P2 = 2 * P_minus1.\n\nBut P_minus1 is the population one year before current time (time -1). So, the population at time -1 is P_minus1. The population at time 0 is P0, which is P_minus1 * 1.10. Because from time -1 to time 0, it's a 10% increase.\n\nSo, P0 = P_minus1 * 1.10 \u2192 P_minus1 = P0 / 1.10.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: P2 = 2 * (P0 / 1.10).\n\nBut P2 is P0*(1.10)^2. So:\n\nP0*(1.10)^2 = 2 * (P0 / 1.10)\n\nDivide both sides by P0: (1.10)^2 = 2 / 1.10\n\nCompute each side:\n\nLeft side: (1.1)^2 = 1.21\n\nRight side: 2 / 1.1 \u2248 1.81818\n\nSo, 1.21 = 1.81818? That's not correct. So there must be a mistake in my setup.\n\nWait, maybe the problem says that the population two years from now is double that of one year ago. Oh wait, one year ago is the time before the current time. So, perhaps the projections are that after two years, the population is double the population from one year ago, which would be the same as the population two years from now is double the population from one year ago. But in that case, perhaps the two years are in the past?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the timeline. Let me try to think differently.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet P be the population one year ago (time t-1).\n\nThen, the current population (time t) is P * 1.10.\n\nThe population next year (time t+1) is (P *1.10) *1.10 = P*(1.10)^2.\n\nThe year after that (time t+2) is P*(1.10)^3.\n\nBut the problem says that the population two years from now (time t+2) is double the population of one year ago (time t-1). So:\n\nP*(1.10)^3 = 2 * P.\n\nWait, that's possible. So, (1.1)^3 = 2.\n\nLet me compute (1.1)^3. 1.1 *1.1=1.21, then 1.21 *1.1=1.331. So, 1.331 is less than 2. So that's not possible either. So I must be getting the timeline wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the two years are the next two years, meaning from current time (t) to t+1, and t+1 to t+2. So, the population at t+2 is double the population at t-1.\n\nWait, but according to that, then P(t+2) = 2 * P(t-1).\n\nSo, P(t+2) = P(t-1) * (1.10)^3.\n\nSo, P(t-1) * (1.10)^3 = 2 * P(t-1).\n\nDivide both sides by P(t-1), assuming it's not zero, we get (1.10)^3 = 2.\n\nBut 1.1^3 is 1.331, which is less than 2, so that can't be correct. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here.\n\nWait, maybe the initial assumption about the growth rate is wrong. Oh wait, the problem states that the planners expect a 10% increase each year over the next two years. So, perhaps the current population is P, and after two years, it's P*(1.1)^2.\n\nBut the problem says that two years from now, the population is double that of one year ago. One year ago would be the population before the current year started. So, perhaps the current population is P, and one year ago it was P_prev, which is P / 1.10, assuming a 10% increase from P_prev to P.\n\nWait, let me try that. So, current population P. One year ago, it was P_prev = P / 1.10.\n\nAfter two years, population is P * 1.1^2.\n\nAccording to the problem, this equals 2 * P_prev.\n\nSo:\n\nP * (1.1)^2 = 2 * (P / 1.10)\n\nSimplify:\n\n(1.1)^2 = 2 / 1.1\n\nCompute left side: 1.21\n\nRight side: 2/1.1 = approx 1.818.\n\nSo 1.21 = 1.818? That's not correct. So perhaps my entire setup is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the 10% increase is for the next two years, so perhaps the increase is 10% each year, meaning the growth factor is 1.10 per year for two years. So, the population after two years is P * (1.10)^2.\n\nBut the problem states that this is equal to twice the population one year ago. So, one year ago's population is P_prev = P_current / 1.10.\n\nSo, P * (1.10)^2 = 2 * (P / 1.10)\n\nAgain, same equation as before, which leads to 1.21 = 1.818, which isn't possible. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the population increase is not annual but perhaps the two-year growth is 10% each year, meaning a total of 20% increase over two years. But that can't be right because the question says 10% per year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two-year growth is 10% per year, so the population in year one is P *1.1, and year two is P *1.1 *1.1, which is 1.21P.\n\nWait, but the problem says that after two years, the population is double that of one year ago. So, one year ago was P_prev, which is the population before the first year's growth. So, P_prev = P /1.1.\n\nWait, so P_prev = P /1.1.\n\nThen, after two years, P2 = P_prev * (1.1)^2.\n\nWait, because from P_prev, it increases by 10% each year for two years.\n\nSo, P2 = P_prev * (1.1)^2.\n\nBut according to the problem, P2 is 2 * P_prev.\n\nSo, P_prev * (1.1)^2 = 2 * P_prev.\n\nDivide both sides by P_prev, assuming it's non-zero.\n\n(1.1)^2 = 2 \u2192 1.21 = 2? No, that's not correct.\n\nThis suggests that there's a contradiction in the problem statement, which can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in my setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the population two years from now is double the population from two years ago, not one year ago. Let me try that. But the problem says one year ago.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misread the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: \"the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.\"\n\nAh, so two years from now is P2, and one year ago is P_minus1. So P2 = 2 * P_minus1.\n\nBut according to the growth projections, P2 is P0*(1.1)^2.\n\nAnd P_minus1 is P0 / 1.10.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nP0*(1.1)^2 = 2*(P0/1.10)\n\nDivide both sides by P0:\n\n(1.1)^2 = 2/(1.10)\n\nCompute:\n\n1.21 = 2/1.1 \u2192 2/1.1 is approximately 1.818.\n\nSo, 1.21 equals 1.818? No, that's impossible. So, that suggests that the problem is impossible under the given conditions, which can't be right. So, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem isn't about the next two years, but the two years before now. No, the problem states the projections are for the next two years.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the population increase over the last year, not the next. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question is: \"Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year?\"\n\nAh, so the last year, meaning the year before the current year. So, perhaps the problem is that the population increased by x% last year, and the projections for the next two years are 10% each year, leading to the population being double that of one year ago (which is the population before last year's increase).\n\nWait, maybe I need to model the population changes over the past and future.\n\nLet me define the current population as P0. Then, one year ago (time -1), the population was P_minus1 = P0 / (1 + r), where r is the growth rate over the last year.\n\nThe problem states that after two years of 10% growth, the population will be double that of one year ago. So, in two years, the population is P0 * (1.10)^2.\n\nAccording to the problem, this equals 2 * P_minus1.\n\nSo:\n\nP0 * (1.10)^2 = 2 * (P0 / (1 + r))\n\nDivide both sides by P0:\n\n(1.10)^2 = 2/(1 + r)\n\nSo, 1.21 = 2/(1 + r)\n\nSolve for (1 + r):\n\n1 + r = 2 / 1.21 \u2248 1.65289\n\nSo, r \u2248 1.65289 - 1 = 0.65289, which is approximately 65.289%.\n\nSo, the population increased by approximately 65.29% over the last year.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 65%, which is the closest.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information:\n\n1. **Timeline and Definitions**:\n   - Let \\( P_0 \\) be the current population.\n   - One year ago, the population was \\( P_{-1} = \\frac{P_0}{1 + r} \\), where \\( r \\) is the growth rate over the last year.\n   - Two years from now, the population will be \\( P_2 = P_0 \\cdot (1.10)^2 \\), assuming a 10% annual growth rate for the next two years.\n\n2. **Key Equation**:\n   The problem states that the population two years from now (\\( P_2 \\)) will be exactly double the population one year ago (\\( P_{-1} \\)).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about population growth in Boomtown. Let me try to break it down. The question says that the population is expected to increase by 10% each year for the next two years. And because of that, the population after two years will be exactly double what it was one year ago. Hmm, wait, that might be a bit confusing. Let me make sure I understand.\n\nSo, let's say the current population is P. But wait, the question is asking about the population increase over the last year. Oh, right, so the population two years from now will be double the population of one year ago. So, let's think about the timeline.\n\nLet me assign some variables to make this clearer. Let me denote:\n\n- Let the population one year ago be P. So, that's the starting point.\n\n- Next year (so, one year from now), the population increases by 10%. So, that would be P multiplied by 1.10. So, P1 = P * 1.10.\n\n- Then, the following year (two years from now), it increases by another 10%. So, P2 = P1 * 1.10. Which is P * 1.10 * 1.10 = P * (1.10)^2.\n\nThe problem states that after two years, the population will be exactly double the population of one year ago. Wait, one year ago was P, so double that would be 2P. So, P2 = 2P.\n\nSo, putting that together:\n\nP * (1.10)^2 = 2P\n\nHmm, wait, that makes sense. Let me compute (1.1)^2. 1.1 * 1.1 is 1.21. So, 1.21P = 2P? That can't be right because 1.21P is less than 2P. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because 1.21P is only a 21% increase over two years, which is way less than double.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the timeline. Let me think again. The population two years from now will be double the population of one year ago. So, one year ago was P, so two years from now is 2P.\n\nBut wait, the way the problem is stated, the projection is that over the next two years, the population increases by 10% each year. So, let's think about the population now, then next year, and the year after.\n\nWait, perhaps I should define the population variables differently. Let's say:\n\nLet the current population be X. Then, one year ago, the population was X divided by 1.10, because if it increased by 10% last year to become X now. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question is about the population increase over the last year. So, perhaps the current population is X, and last year it was X / 1.10, since it increased by 10% to become X.\n\nWait, maybe I should model this more carefully. Let me think about the timeline.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let the population one year ago be P.\n\n- Then, last year, it increased by 10% to become P * 1.10. That's the current population, right? So, current population is P * 1.10.\n\nNow, the projection is that over the next two years, the population will increase by 10% each year. So, next year, it will be P * 1.10 * 1.10 = P * 1.21.\n\nAnd the year after that, it will be P * 1.21 * 1.10 = P * 1.331.\n\nWait, but the problem says that two years from now, the population will be exactly double the population of one year ago. One year ago was P. So, two years from now, it's supposed to be 2P.\n\nSo, according to the projection, two years from now, the population is 1.331P. But according to the problem, it should be 2P. So, that's a contradiction unless my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the timeline. Let me re-express the variables. Let me let P be the population two years ago. Then, one year ago, it was P * 1.10 (assuming a 10% increase). The current population is that multiplied by another 10%, so P * 1.10^2.\n\nWait, but the problem says that two years from now, the population will be double the population of one year ago. So, one year ago was P * 1.10. Two years from now, the population would be P * 1.10^2 * 1.10^2 (because two more years of 10% each). Wait, no, that's four years ahead. Hmm, no, wait.\n\nWait, no, the projection is for the next two years, so starting from the current time. Let me try to structure this again.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let current population be X.\n\n- One year ago, the population was X / 1.10, because it increased by 10% to become X.\n\n- Next year (one year from now), the population will be X * 1.10.\n\n- The year after that (two years from now), it'll be X * 1.10^2.\n\nThe problem states that two years from now, the population will be double the population of one year ago. So, two years from now: X * (1.10)^2 = 2 * (X / 1.10).\n\nBecause one year ago was X / 1.10, and two years from now it's double that.\n\nSo, let's write the equation:\n\nX * (1.1)^2 = 2 * (X / 1.1)\n\nWe can cancel X from both sides (assuming X \u2260 0), so:\n\n(1.1)^2 = 2 / 1.1\n\nCompute each side:\n\nLeft side: (1.1)^2 = 1.21\n\nRight side: 2 / 1.1 \u2248 1.81818...\n\nSo, 1.21 \u2248 1.818? No, that's not correct. So, 1.21 = 1.818? That's impossible. So, this suggests that our initial assumption might be wrong.\n\nHmm, perhaps I got the timeline wrong. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says the population is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. So, that's the projection. And as a result of that projection, the population two years from now would be double the population of one year ago.\n\nWait, perhaps the current time is one year ago. Let me try that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the population one year ago is P, and the projection is for the next two years. So, let me define:\n\n- P is the population one year ago.\n\n- Next year, it will be P * 1.10.\n\n- The year after, P * 1.10^2.\n\nThe problem says that two years from now, the population will be double the population of one year ago. So, that's 2P.\n\nSo, P * (1.10)^2 = 2P\n\nDivide both sides by P: 1.21 = 2\n\nWait, that can't be right. 1.21 is not 2. So, that's impossible. So, perhaps the problem is not using a 10% increase each of the next two years, but rather an increase that results in doubling the population from one year ago. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says that over the next two years, the population increases by 10% each year, which would make the population two years from now equal to P * (1.10)^2, which is 1.21P.\n\nBut the problem says that this is equal to double the population of one year ago. So, 1.21P = 2 * (P / 1.10). Because one year ago, the population was P, and last year, it increased by 10% to become P*1.10, which is the current population. So, one year ago, it was P.\n\nWait, wait, I think I'm mixing up the time frames. Let me think carefully.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- Let\u2019s say one year ago, the population was P.\n\n- Last year, it increased by 10% to become P * 1.10. So, current population is P * 1.10.\n\n- Next year, it will increase by 10% again, making it P * 1.10^2.\n\n- The year after that, it will be P * 1.10^3.\n\nBut the problem says that two years from now, the population will be double the population of one year ago. So, two years from now would be P * 1.10^3? No, wait. Wait, two years from now is from the current time. Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the current time being time zero.\n\nLet me try this approach:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the current population as X.\n\nOne year ago, the population was X / 1.10 (since it increased by 10% to reach X).\n\nTwo years from now, the population will be X * 1.10^2 (because it's increasing 10% each year for two years).\n\nThe problem states that two years from now, the population will be double the population of one year ago. So:\n\nX * (1.10)^2 = 2 * (X / 1.10)\n\nDivide both sides by X:\n\n(1.10)^2 = 2 / 1.10\n\nCompute left side: 1.21\n\nCompute right side: 2 / 1.10 \u2248 1.81818\n\nSo, 1.21 = 1.81818? That's not correct. So, this can't be. Which means I must have made a mistake in my setup.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is referring to the population one year ago as the starting point, and the projection is that two years from now, it's double that.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet\u2019s say the population one year ago was P.\n\nAfter the next two years of 10% growth each, the population would be P * 1.10^2.\n\nAnd the problem states that this is equal to 2P (double the population of one year ago).\n\nSo:\n\nP * (1.10)^2 = 2P\n\nDivide both sides by P:\n\n1.21 = 2\n\nThat's not possible. So, clearly, I'm setting up the equations wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is saying that the population increases by 10% per year over the next two years, and that as a result, the population two years from now is double the population of one year ago. So, perhaps the projection is that two years from now, it's double. But according to the 10% growth, that's not the case. So, maybe the actual growth rate in the past was different.\n\nWait, wait a minute. The question is asking about the percent population increase over the last year, not the projection. So, perhaps the projection is for the next two years, but the question is about the growth from one year ago to now, which would be the last year.\n\nSo, let's model it as:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Let the population one year ago be P.\n\n- The current population is P * (1 + r), where r is the growth rate over the last year.\n\n- The projection is that over the next two years, the population increases by 10% each year. So, next year, it will be current * 1.10 = P*(1+r)*1.10. The year after, it'll be P*(1+r)*1.10^2.\n\nThe problem states that two years from now, the population will be double the population of one year ago. So:\n\nP*(1 + r)*1.10^2 = 2P\n\nDivide both sides by P:\n\n(1 + r) * (1.10)^2 = 2\n\nWe can compute (1.10)^2 = 1.21.\n\nSo:\n\n(1 + r) * 1.21 = 2\n\nDivide both sides by 1.21:\n\n1 + r = 2 / 1.21 \u2248 1.65289\n\nSo, r \u2248 1.65289 - 1 = 0.65289, which is approximately 65.289%.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option D) 65%.\n\nSo, the answer should be D)65%.\n",

Let me think carefully.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- Let\u2019s say one year ago, the population was P.\n\n- Last year, it increased by 10% to become P * 1.10. So, current population is P * 1.10.\n\n- Next year, it will increase by 10% again, making it P * 1.10^2.\n\n- The year after that, it will be P * 1.10^3.\n\nBut the problem says that two years from now, the population will be double the population of one year ago. So, two years from now would be P * 1.10^3? No, wait. Wait, two years from now is from the current time. Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the current time being time zero.\n\nLet me try this approach:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the current population as X.\n\nOne year ago, the population was X / 1.10 (since it increased by 10% to reach X).\n\nTwo years from now, the population will be X * 1.10^2 (because it's increasing 10% each year for two years).\n\nThe problem states that two years from now, the population will be double the population of one year ago. So:\n\nX * (1.10)^2 = 2 * (X / 1.10)\n\nDivide both sides by X:\n\n(1.10)^2 = 2 / 1.10\n\nCompute left side: 1.21\n\nCompute right side: 2 / 1.10 \u2248 1.81818\n\nSo, 1.21 = 1.81818? That's not correct. So, this can't be. Which means I must have made a mistake in my setup.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is referring to the population one year ago as the starting point, and the projection is that two years from now, it's double that.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet\u2019s say the population one year ago was P.\n\nAfter the next two years of 10% growth each, the population would be P * 1.10^2.\n\nAnd the problem states that this is equal to 2P (double the population of one year ago).\n\nSo:\n\nP * (1.10)^2 = 2P\n\nDivide both sides by P:\n\n1.21 = 2\n\nThat's not possible. So, clearly, I'm setting up the equations wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is saying that the population increases by 10% per year over the next two years, and that as a result, the population two years from now is double the population of one year ago. So, perhaps the projection is that two years from now, it's double. But according to the 10% growth, that's not the case. So, maybe the actual growth rate in the past was different.\n\nWait, wait a minute. The question is asking about the percent population increase over the last year, not the projection. So, perhaps the projection is for the next two years, but the question is about the growth from one year ago to now, which would be the last year.\n\nSo, let's model it as:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Let the population one year ago be P.\n\n- The current population is P * (1 + r), where r is the growth rate over the last year.\n\n- The projection is that over the next two years, the population increases by 10% each year. So, next year, it will be current * 1.10 = P*(1+r)*1.10. The year after, it'll be P*(1+r)*1.10^2.\n\nThe problem states that two years from now, the population will be double the population of one year ago. So:\n\nP*(1 + r)*1.10^2 = 2P\n\nDivide both sides by P:\n\n(1 + r) * (1.10)^2 = 2\n\nWe can compute (1.10)^2 = 1.21.\n\nSo:\n\n(1 + r) * 1.21 = 2\n\nDivide both sides by 1.21:\n\n1 + r = 2 / 1.21 \u2248 1.65289\n\nSo, r \u2248 1.65289 - 1 = 0.65289, which is approximately 65.289%.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option D) 65%.\n\nSo, the answer should be D)65%.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year, given that the population is projected to grow by 10% per year for the next two years, and that this growth will result in the population two years from now being exactly double the population one year ago.\n\n### Defining Variables:\n- Let the population one year ago be \\( P \\).\n- The current population is \\( P \\times (1 + r) \\), where \\( r \\) is the growth rate over the last year.\n- The projection is that the population will grow by 10% each year for the next two years. Thus:\n  - Next year's population: \\( P \\times (1 + r) \\times 1.10 \\),\n  - Population two years from now: \\( P \\times (1 + r) \\times 1.10^2 \\).\n\n### Key Equation:\nThe problem states that two years from now, the population will be double the population one year ago. Therefore:\n\\[\nP \\times (1 + r) \\times 1.10^2 = 2P\n\\]\n\n### Simplifying:\n1. Divide both sides by \\( P \\) (assuming \\( P \\neq 0 \\)):\n   \\[\n   (1 + r) \\times 1.10^2 = 2\n   \\]\n2. Compute \\( 1.10^2 = 1.21 \\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + r) \\times 1.21 = 2\n   \\]\n3. Divide both sides by 1.21:\n   \\[\n   1 + r = \\frac{2}{1.21} \\approx 1.65289\n   \\]\n4. Solve for \\( r \\):\n   \\[\n   r \\approx 1.65289 - 1 = 0.65289\n   \\]\n   Converting to a percentage:\n   \\[\n   r \\approx 65.289\\%\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe percent population increase over the last year is approximately \\( 65.289\\% \\), which is closest to **65%**.\n\nAnswer: D",

Let me try to understand it step by step. \n\nThe question says that the planners expect a 10% increase each year for the next two years. So, if I think about the next two years, the population will go up by 10% each year. But wait, the problem also states that after these two years, the population will be exactly double what it was one year ago. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me break it down.\n\nLet me denote the current population as P. Wait, no, actually, I think I need to consider the timeline properly. Let me clarify the time points. Let's say the current time is year 0. One year ago would be year -1, and two years from now is year +2. \n\nSo, according to the problem, the population two years from now (year +2) is double the population one year ago (year -1). So, I need to model the population changes from year -1 to year +2.\n\nWait, but the growth is projected for the next two years, which are years 0 to 1 and 1 to 2. So, from year 0 to year 1, a 10% increase, and from year 1 to year 2, another 10% increase.\n\nBut I think the question is asking about the population changes over the last year, which would be from year 0 to year -1, but wait, that doesn't make sense because the next two years are future. Maybe I'm getting the timeline wrong.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem says that if the projection comes true, the population two years from now (so, in the future) will be double the population of one year ago. So, maybe the 'one year ago' is relative to the current time. Hmm, perhaps I should set up variables based on the current population.\n\nLet me define variables more clearly. Let's say the current population is P. Then, one year ago, the population was P_current divided by 1.1, because it's 10% less (since it's one year prior, assuming it's growing at 10% each year). Wait, but wait, no. Because the problem says the planners expect a 10% increase per year over the next two years. So, the growth is projected for the future, not the past. So, the past growth rate isn't given, and that's what the question is asking.\n\nWait, the question is asking for the percentage increase over the last year. So, perhaps the current population is P, and one year ago it was P_prev, and two years from now it's P_future. And P_future is double P_prev.\n\nSo, P_future = 2 * P_prev.\n\nThe growth from current to next two years is 10% each year. So, P_future = P * 1.1 * 1.1 = P * 1.21.\n\nBut P_future is also equal to 2 * P_prev. And P_prev is the population one year ago, which is P / 1.1, because if current is P, last year's population would be P / 1.1 (since it's a 10% increase from last year to this year). \n\nWait, that's assuming that the last year's growth was also 10%. But the problem doesn't state that. Hmm, maybe that's not correct. Because the question is asking about the past year's growth, which might not be 10%. So, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.\n\nLet me rephrase. Let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s say the population one year ago was P. Then, the current population (this year) would be P * (1 + x), where x is the growth rate for the last year. So, the growth rate we're trying to find is x, which is the percentage increase from last year to this year.\n\nThen, the population increases by 10% each of the next two years. So, next year (year 1) the population will be this year's population times 1.1: P*(1+x)*1.1. Then, the year after that (year 2) will be P*(1+x)*1.1^2.\n\nAccording to the problem, the population two years from now (year 2) is exactly double the population one year ago (which was P). So, P*(1+x)*(1.1)^2 = 2P.\n\nHmm, because the population two years from now is equal to twice the population of one year ago. So, let's set up the equation:\n\nP*(1 + x)*(1.1)^2 = 2P.\n\nWe can divide both sides by P to simplify:\n\n(1 + x)*(1.21) = 2.\n\nBecause (1.1)^2 is 1.21.\n\nSo, 1.21*(1 + x) = 2.\n\nDivide both sides by 1.21:\n\n1 + x = 2 / 1.21.\n\nCalculate 2 / 1.21. Let me compute that. 1.21 is approximately 121/100, so 2/(121/100) = 200/121 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSo, 1 + x \u2248 1.65289 \u2192 x \u2248 0.65289, which is about 65.289%.\n\nSo, the percentage increase over the last year is approximately 65.29%, which is closest to option D)65%.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the setup to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe I should think about the current population as P.

But wait, no, if last year's population was P_prev, and this year's is P, then P = P_prev * (1 + r), so P_prev = P/(1 + r).\n\nBut the future population after two years is P*(1.1)^2, which is equal to 2*P_prev.\n\nSo, substituting P_prev = P/(1 + r), we have:\n\nP*(1.1)^2 = 2*(P/(1 + r)).\n\nDivide both sides by P:\n\n(1.21) = 2/(1 + r).\n\nSo, 1 + r = 2 / 1.21 \u2248 1.65289 \u2192 r \u2248 0.65289, which is about 65.29%.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about population growth in a place called Boomtown. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Hmm, the question says that the planners expect a 10% increase each year for the next two years. And if that happens, the population two years from now will be exactly double what it was one year ago. I need to find the percent increase over the last year. Wait, no, wait, the question is about the percent increase in the last year. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me read the question again.\n\nSo, the population is expected to increase by 10% each year for the next two years. So that's a growth rate of 10% per annum for two years. And if that projection is correct, then two years from now, the population would be double what it was one year ago. Wait, wait. So let me parse this. Let's say the current population is P. Wait, no, maybe I should define some variables.\n\nLet me think. Let's let P be the population one year ago. Then, next year, in one year from now, the population would be P plus 10% of P, which is 1.1 * P. Because a 10% increase. Then, the year after that, another 10% increase. So two years from now, the population would be 1.1 * (1.1 * P) = (1.1)^2 * P. Which is 1.21 * P.\n\nWait, but the problem says that two years from now, the population would be exactly double the population of one year ago. So two years from now is 2 years after the current point. Wait, no. Wait, let me clarify the timeline. Let me make a timeline.\n\nLet me define the current time as now. The population one year ago is P. So one year ago: population = P. Then, the next year (this year) would be P + 10% of P = 1.1 P. Then, the year after that (next year), another 10% increase, so 1.1 * 1.1 P = 1.21 P. So two years from now, the population would be 1.21 P.\n\nBut according to the problem, that population two years from now is exactly double the population of one year ago. One year ago, the population was P, so double that would be 2P. So according to the problem, 1.21 P equals 2P. Wait, that can't be right because 1.21 P can't equal 2P unless P is zero, which it isn't. Oh wait, wait a second, maybe I got the timeline wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should define the variables differently. Let me try this again. Let me let the population one year ago be P. Then, the population last year (one year ago) was P. So, the population now (this year) is P plus 10% of P, which is 1.1 P. Then, next year (one year from now), it's 1.1 times that, so 1.1 * 1.1 P = 1.21 P. So two years from now, it's 1.21 P.\n\nBut the problem states that two years from now, the population is exactly double the population of one year ago. One year ago was P, so double that is 2P. So according to the problem, 1.21 P = 2P. But that can't be right because 1.21 isn't equal to 2. So I must have messed up the timeline.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me read it again. It says, \"the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.\" Oh, wait, maybe \"one year ago\" refers to one year before the projection started. Wait, perhaps the projection is made now, and the population is expected to increase by 10% each year for the next two years. So the current time is now, and the projection is for the next two years. So the population one year ago would be before the start of the projection.\n\nLet me try this approach. Let me define:\n\nLet\u2019s say the current population is P. The projection is for the next two years, each with a 10% increase. So next year, the population would be 1.1 P. The year after that, 1.1 times that, so 1.21 P.\n\nBut the problem says that two years from now, the population would be double the population of one year ago. One year ago from now is P (current population minus one year). Wait, no, wait. One year ago from now is the population before current time. Let me think.\n\nIf now is the present, then one year ago was the population P_prev. So, the projection is for the next two years: next year it's P_prev * 1.1, and the year after that, it's P_prev * 1.1^2. So two years from now, population is P_prev * 1.21.\n\nThe problem states that this two years from now population is exactly double the population of one year ago. So, one year ago's population was P_prev. So, 2 * P_prev = P_prev * 1.21.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 2 = 1.21 is impossible. So I must have the timeline wrong. Maybe I should model the current population as the starting point.\n\nWait, perhaps the current population is P. The population two years from now is P * (1.1)^2 = 1.21 P. The population one year ago is P / 1.1, because if the current population is P, then last year it was P / 1.1 (assuming a 10% increase from last year to this year). So, if two years from now the population is double that of one year ago, then 1.21 P = 2 * (P / 1.1).\n\nLet me write that equation: 1.21 P = 2 * (P / 1.1).\n\nLet me compute the right side: 2 * (P / 1.1) = (2/1.1) P \u2248 1.818 P.\n\nSo 1.21 P = 1.818 P? That can't be right because 1.21 is not equal to 1.818. So something's wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the timeline. Let me think again. Let me model the timeline as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s assume the population one year ago was P. So, the current population (now) is P * 1.1. Because it increased by 10% over the past year. Then, next year, it's 1.1 times the current population, so 1.1 * (1.1 P) = 1.21 P. So two years from now, population is 1.21 P.\n\nThe problem states that two years from now, the population is double that of one year ago. One year ago, the population was P. So, 1.21 P = 2 * P.\n\nWait, but that would mean 1.21 P = 2 P \u2192 1.21 = 2 \u2192 which is impossible. So this suggests that my initial assumption is wrong. So perhaps the way I'm setting up the variables is incorrect.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the problem is that the 10% increase is per year for the next two years, and the projection is made from the current time. So the current population is P. Next year, it's 1.1 P. The year after, 1.1 * 1.1 P = 1.21 P. So two years from now, the population is 1.21 P.\n\nBut the problem says that two years from now, the population is double that of one year ago. So, one year ago, the population was P_prev, which is P / 1.1, assuming that the current population is after a 10% increase from last year.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-clarify. Let me set up variables more clearly.\n\nLet me let P be the population one year ago. Then, the current population is P * 1.1. Because it's a 10% increase from last year.\n\nThen, next year (one year from now), the population will be 1.1 times the current population, which is 1.1 * (1.1 P) = 1.21 P.\n\nThen, the year after that (two years from now), it's 1.1 * 1.21 P = 1.331 P.\n\nWait, but the problem says that two years from now, the population is exactly double the population of one year ago. So, two years from now, population is 1.331 P. One year ago, population was P.\n\nSo 1.331 P = 2 * P \u2192 1.331 = 2 \u2192 which is impossible. So clearly, this approach isn't working.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the timeline. Let me try a different approach. Let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define the population one year ago as P. So, the current population is P * 1.1. Because it's a 10% increase from last year to now.\n\nThen, next year (one year from now), the population will be 1.1 * (1.1 P) = 1.21 P.\n\nTwo years from now, it will be 1.1 * 1.21 P = 1.331 P.\n\nBut according to the problem, two years from now, the population is double that of one year ago. One year ago was P, so double is 2P. So 1.331 P = 2 P \u2192 which is again impossible.\n\nHmm, I must be getting the setup wrong. Let me try again. Maybe the 'one year ago' refers to one year before the projection started. Let me think: the projection is for the next two years, starting from now. So, the population now is P. Next year, it's 1.1 P. The year after, 1.21 P. So, two years from now is 1.21 P.\n\nThe problem says that this is double the population of one year ago. So one year ago from now is P_prev. So P_prev is the population before the current year. So, the current population P is 1.1 * P_prev \u2192 P_prev = P / 1.1.\n\nSo, two years from now, the population is 1.21 P, which equals 2 * P_prev.\n\nSo, 1.21 P = 2 * (P / 1.1).\n\nLet me compute that: 1.21 P = (2/1.1) P \u2192 1.21 = 2 / 1.1 \u2192 2 /1.1 is approximately 1.818.\n\nBut 1.21 is not equal to 1.818. So that can't be. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the population is expected to increase by 10% each year for the next two years. So, the growth is 10% per year, but the current population is P. So, in one year, it's 1.1 P. In two years, it's 1.21 P.\n\nBut the problem says that two years from now, the population is double that of one year ago. So, one year ago from two years from now is one year ago from now plus two years. Wait, no, that's confusing.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let me assign variables based on the current time as t=0.\n\nAt t=0: population is P.\n\nAt t=1: 1.1 P.\n\nAt t=2: 1.21 P.\n\nThe problem states that at t=2, the population is double the population at t=-1 (one year ago). So t=-1's population is P_prev.\n\nSo, P_prev is P / 1.1, because from t=-1 to t=0, it's a 10% increase. So, P = 1.1 * P_prev \u2192 P_prev = P / 1.1.\n\nSo, the condition is that at t=2, the population is 2 * P_prev.\n\nSo, 1.21 P = 2 * (P / 1.1).\n\nLet me compute 2 / 1.1 \u2192 approximately 1.818.\n\nSo, 1.21 P = 1.818 P \u2192 which can't be true unless P is zero, which it's not. So this doesn't make sense. So maybe I'm setting up the variables incorrectly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the growth rate is 10% per year for the next two years, but the problem is about the growth over the last year, not the next two. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nWait, the question is asking: Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year?\n\nWait, no, the question is asking for the percent increase in the last year. Wait, no, I think I'm getting mixed up. Let me read the question again.\n\nWait, the question says: \"the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.\" So, perhaps the 'one year ago' is from two years from now. Wait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, let me model the timeline again. Let me define:\n\n- t0: two years ago.\n\n- t1: one year ago.\n\n- t2: current time (now).\n\n- t3: one year from now.\n\n- t4: two years from now.\n\nThe problem states that the population is expected to increase by 10% each year for the next two years. So from t2 to t3: 10% increase, and t3 to t4: another 10% increase.\n\nSo, population at t2 is P.\n\nt3: P * 1.1.\n\nt4: P * 1.1^2 = 1.21 P.\n\nThe problem says that at t4, the population is exactly double the population of one year ago. One year ago from t4 is t3. So, the population at t3 is P * 1.1. So, the condition is:\n\nPopulation at t4 = 2 * population at t3.\n\nSo, 1.21 P = 2 * (1.1 P).\n\nWait, 1.21 P = 2.2 P \u2192 1.21 = 2.2 \u2192 which is not possible.\n\nHmm, that can't be. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the 'one year ago' is from the current time. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me define:\n\nAt t0: one year ago \u2192 population is P.\n\nAt t1: current time (now) \u2192 population is P * 1.1.\n\nAt t2: next year \u2192 1.1 * current population = 1.1^2 P.\n\nAt t3: two years from now \u2192 1.1^3 P.\n\nWait, but the problem says that two years from now (t2) the population is double that of one year ago (t0). So, 1.1^2 P = 2 P \u2192 1.21 P = 2 P \u2192 1.21 = 2 \u2192 again, impossible.\n\nSo, clearly, this approach isn't working. So perhaps the problem is not about a 10% increase per year for the next two years, but the projection is that over the next two years, the population increases by 10% each year, and the result is that two years from now, the population is double what it was one year ago (from the projection's starting point).\n\nWait, perhaps the projection is made from a starting point, say, year X. The projection is for the next two years (X+1 and X+2), each with 10% growth. So, from X to X+1: 10% increase. From X+1 to X+2: another 10% increase.\n\nSo, the population at X is P.\n\nAt X+1: 1.1 P.\n\nAt X+2: 1.21 P.\n\nThe problem says that at X+2, the population is double that at X-1. So X-1 is one year before X. So, the population at X-1 would be P_prev.\n\nSo, P = 1.1 * P_prev \u2192 P_prev = P / 1.1.\n\nSo, at X+2, population is 1.21 P. This should equal 2 * P_prev.\n\nSo, 1.21 P = 2 * (P / 1.1).\n\nSimplify the right side: 2P / 1.1 \u2248 1.818 P.\n\nSo, 1.21 P = 1.818 P \u2192 which again can't be true. So this approach isn't working.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's try to model it mathematically.\n\nLet\u2019s let P be the population one year ago. So, one year ago: P.\n\nNow, the population has increased by some rate 'r' over the last year to reach the current population. So current population is P * (1 + r).\n\nThen, the planners expect a 10% increase each of the next two years. So, next year's population will be 1.1 * (current population) = 1.1 * P*(1 + r) = 1.1 (1 + r) P.\n\nThe year after that (two years from now), it'll be 1.1 times that, so 1.1^2 (1 + r) P.\n\nThe problem says that this two years from now population is double the population of one year ago. So, 1.21 (1 + r) P = 2 * P.\n\nBecause one year ago's population was P.\n\nSo, 1.21 (1 + r) P = 2 P \u2192 1.21 (1 + r) = 2 \u2192 (1 + r) = 2 / 1.21.\n\nCompute 2 / 1.21: 1.21 is 121/100, so 2/(121/100) = 200/121 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSo, 1 + r = 1.65289 \u2192 r = 0.65289, which is approximately 65.289%.\n\nSo, the population increased by approximately 65.3% over the last year.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option D) 65%.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about population growth in a place called Boomtown. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Hmm, the question says that the planners expect a 10% increase each year for the next two years. And if that happens, the population two years from now will be exactly double what it was one year ago. I need to find the percent increase over the last year. Wait, no, wait, the question is about the percent increase in the last year. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me read the question again.\n\nSo, the population is expected to increase by 10% each year for the next two years. So that's a growth rate of 10% per annum for two years. And if that projection is correct, then two years from now, the population would be double what it was one year ago. Wait, wait. So let me parse this. Let's say the current population is P. Wait, no, maybe I should define some variables.\n\nLet me think. Let's let P be the population one year ago. Then, next year, in one year from now, the population would be P plus 10% of P, which is 1.1 * P. Because a 10% increase. Then, the year after that, another 10% increase. So two years from now, the population would be 1.1 * (1.1 * P) = (1.1)^2 * P. Which is 1.21 * P.\n\nWait, but the problem says that two years from now, the population would be exactly double the population of one year ago. So two years from now is 2 years after the current point. Wait, no. Wait, let me clarify the timeline. Let me make a timeline.\n\nLet me define the current time as now. The population one year ago is P. So one year ago: population = P. Then, the next year (this year) would be P + 10% of P = 1.1 P. Then, the year after that (next year), another 10% increase, so 1.1 * 1.1 P = 1.21 P. So two years from now, the population would be 1.21 P.\n\nBut according to the problem, that population two years from now is exactly double the population of one year ago. One year ago, the population was P, so double that would be 2P. So according to the problem, 1.21 P equals 2P. Wait, that can't be right because 1.21 P can't equal 2P unless P is zero, which it isn't. Oh wait, wait a second, maybe I got the timeline wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should define the variables differently. Let me try this again. Let me let the population one year ago be P. Then, the population last year (one year ago) was P. So, the population now (this year) is P plus 10% of P, which is 1.1 P. Then, next year (one year from now), it's 1.1 times that, so 1.1 * 1.1 P = 1.21 P. So two years from now, it's 1.21 P.\n\nBut the problem states that two years from now, the population is exactly double the population of one year ago. One year ago was P, so double that is 2P. So according to the problem, 1.21 P = 2P. But that can't be right because 1.21 isn't equal to 2. So I must have messed up the timeline.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me read it again. It says, \"the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.\" Oh, wait, maybe \"one year ago\" refers to one year before the projection started. Wait, perhaps the projection is made now, and the population is expected to increase by 10% each year for the next two years. So the current time is now, and the projection is for the next two years. So the population one year ago would be before the start of the projection.\n\nLet me try this approach. Let me define:\n\nLet\u2019s say the current population is P. The projection is for the next two years, each with a 10% increase. So next year, the population would be 1.1 P. The year after that, 1.1 times that, so 1.21 P.\n\nBut the problem says that two years from now, the population would be double the population of one year ago. One year ago from now is P (current population minus one year). Wait, no, wait. One year ago from now is the population before current time. Let me think.\n\nIf now is the present, then one year ago was the population P_prev. So, the projection is for the next two years: next year it's P_prev * 1.1, and the year after that, it's P_prev * 1.1^2. So two years from now, population is P_prev * 1.21.\n\nThe problem states that this two years from now population is exactly double the population of one year ago. So, one year ago's population was P_prev. So, 2 * P_prev = P_prev * 1.21.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 2 = 1.21 is impossible. So I must have the timeline wrong. Maybe I should model the current population as the starting point.\n\nWait, perhaps the current population is P. The population two years from now is P * (1.1)^2 = 1.21 P. The population one year ago is P / 1.1, because if the current population is P, then last year it was P / 1.1 (assuming a 10% increase from last year to this year). So, if two years from now the population is double that of one year ago, then 1.21 P = 2 * (P / 1.1).\n\nLet me write that equation: 1.21 P = 2 * (P / 1.1).\n\nLet me compute the right side: 2 * (P / 1.1) = (2/1.1) P \u2248 1.818 P.\n\nSo 1.21 P = 1.818 P?

So, two years from now, population is 1.331 P. One year ago, population was P.\n\nSo 1.331 P = 2 * P \u2192 1.331 = 2 \u2192 which is impossible.

In two years, it's 1.21 P.\n\nBut the problem says that two years from now, the population is double that of one year ago. So, one year ago from two years from now is one year ago from now plus two years. Wait, no, that's confusing.\n\nWait, let me think differently.

So this doesn't make sense. So maybe I'm setting up the variables incorrectly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the growth rate is 10% per year for the next two years, but the problem is about the growth over the last year, not the next two. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nWait, the question is asking: Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year?\n\nWait, no, the question is asking for the percent increase in the last year. Wait, no, I think I'm getting mixed up. Let me read the question again.\n\nWait, the question says: \"the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.\" So, perhaps the 'one year ago' is from two years from now.

So from t2 to t3: 10% increase, and t3 to t4: another 10% increase.\n\nSo, population at t2 is P.\n\nt3: P * 1.1.\n\nt4: P * 1.1^2 = 1.21 P.\n\nThe problem says that at t4, the population is exactly double the population of one year ago. One year ago from t4 is t3. So, the population at t3 is P * 1.1. So, the condition is:\n\nPopulation at t4 = 2 * population at t3.\n\nSo, 1.21 P = 2 * (1.1 P).\n\nWait, 1.21 P = 2.2 P \u2192 1.21 = 2.2 \u2192 which is not possible.\n\nHmm, that can't be. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the 'one year ago' is from the current time. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me define:\n\nAt t0: one year ago \u2192 population is P.\n\nAt t1: current time (now) \u2192 population is P * 1.1.\n\nAt t2: next year \u2192 1.1 * current population = 1.1^2 P.\n\nAt t3: two years from now \u2192 1.1^3 P.\n\nWait, but the problem says that two years from now (t2) the population is double that of one year ago (t0). So, 1.1^2 P = 2 P \u2192 1.21 P = 2 P \u2192 1.21 = 2 \u2192 again, impossible.\n\nSo, clearly, this approach isn't working. So perhaps the problem is not about a 10% increase per year for the next two years, but the projection is that over the next two years, the population increases by 10% each year, and the result is that two years from now, the population is double what it was one year ago (from the projection's starting point).\n\nWait, perhaps the projection is made from a starting point, say, year X. The projection is for the next two years (X+1 and X+2), each with 10% growth. So, from X to X+1: 10% increase. From X+1 to X+2: another 10% increase.\n\nSo, the population at X is P.\n\nAt X+1: 1.1 P.\n\nAt X+2: 1.21 P.\n\nThe problem says that at X+2, the population is double that at X-1. So X-1 is one year before X. So, the population at X-1 would be P_prev.\n\nSo, P = 1.1 * P_prev \u2192 P_prev = P / 1.1.\n\nSo, at X+2, population is 1.21 P. This should equal 2 * P_prev.\n\nSo, 1.21 P = 2 * (P / 1.1).\n\nSimplify the right side: 2P / 1.1 \u2248 1.818 P.\n\nSo, 1.21 P = 1.818 P \u2192 which again can't be true. So this approach isn't working.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's try to model it mathematically.\n\nLet\u2019s let P be the population one year ago. So, one year ago: P.\n\nNow, the population has increased by some rate 'r' over the last year to reach the current population. So current population is P * (1 + r).\n\nThen, the planners expect a 10% increase each of the next two years. So, next year's population will be 1.1 * (current population) = 1.1 * P*(1 + r) = 1.1 (1 + r) P.\n\nThe year after that (two years from now), it'll be 1.1 times that, so 1.1^2 (1 + r) P.\n\nThe problem says that this two years from now population is double the population of one year ago. So, 1.21 (1 + r) P = 2 * P.\n\nBecause one year ago's population was P.\n\nSo, 1.21 (1 + r) P = 2 P \u2192 1.21 (1 + r) = 2 \u2192 (1 + r) = 2 / 1.21.\n\nCompute 2 / 1.21: 1.21 is 121/100, so 2/(121/100) = 200/121 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSo, 1 + r = 1.65289 \u2192 r = 0.65289, which is approximately 65.289%.\n\nSo, the population increased by approximately 65.3% over the last year.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option D) 65%.\n\n\nLet\u2019s define the population one year ago as \\( P \\). The problem states that the population is expected to increase by 10% per year for the next two years. This means:\n\n- After one year from now: \\( P \\times 1.1 \\)\n- After two years from now: \\( P \\times 1.1^2 = 1.21P \\)\n\nThe problem also states that the population two years from now will be exactly double the population of one year ago. Since one year ago the population was \\( P \\), double that population is \\( 2P \\). Therefore, we set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n1.21P = 2P\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( P \\), we divide both sides by \\( P \\) (assuming \\( P \\neq 0 \\)):\n\n\\[\n1.21 = 2\n\\]\n\nThis is impossible, so we must re-express the problem. Let\u2019s instead define the current population as \\( P \\). One year ago, the population was \\( P / 1.1 \\) (since the population increased by 10% from last year to this year). Two years from now, the population will be:\n\n\\[\nP \\times 1.1^2 = 1.21P\n\\]\n\nThe problem states that this population two years from now is double the population one year ago. Therefore:\n\n\\[\n1.21P = 2 \\times \\left(\\frac{P}{1.1}\\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n\\[\n1.21P = \\frac{2P}{1.1}\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by \\( P \\) (assuming \\( P \\neq 0 \\)):\n\n\\[\n1.21 = \\frac{2}{1.1}\n\\]\n\nCalculate \\( \\frac{2}{1.1} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{1.1} \\approx 1.818\n\\]\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n1.21 = 1.818\n\\]\n\nThis is still impossible, so we must consider the growth rate over the last year. Let the population one year ago be \\( P \\). If the population increased by \\( r \\) over the last year, the current population is:\n\n\\[\nP \\times (1 + r)\n\\]\n\nFor the next two years, the population grows at 10% per year:\n\n- After one year: \\( P \\times (1 + r) \\times 1.1 \\)\n- After two years: \\( P \\times (1 + r) \\times 1.1^2 = P \\times (1 + r) \\times 1.21 \\)\n\nThe problem states that after two years, the population is double the population one year ago (\\( P \\)). Therefore:\n\n\\[\nP \\times (1 + r) \\times 1.21 = 2P\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by \\( P \\) (assuming \\( P \\neq 0 \\)):\n\n\\[\n(1 + r) \\times 1.21 = 2\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\( 1 + r \\):\n\n\\[\n1 + r = \\frac{2}{1.21} \\approx 1.65289\n\\]\n\nSubtract 1 to find \\( r \\):\n\n\\[\nr \\approx 0.65289\n\\]\n\nConvert to a percentage:\n\n\\[\nr \\approx 65.289\\%\n\\]\n\nThe closest option to this value is **65%**.\n\n**Answer: D**",

Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question says that the city's planners expect a 10% increase each year for the next two years. If that happens, then two years from now, the population would be exactly double what it was one year ago. I need to find the percent population increase over the last year, and choose the closest option from the given choices.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. I think I should set up some variables to model this situation.\n\nLet me define P as the current population. Wait, actually, let me think: the problem talks about the population two years from now and one year ago. So maybe I should define variables for different times.\n\nLet me see. Let's say:\n\n- Let P be the population one year ago.\n- Then, the population last year (which is this year) would be P plus a 10% increase? Or wait, wait, the problem says the projection is for the next two years, so maybe the current population is different.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline the timeline.\n\nThe problem says that the planners expect a 10% increase each year over the next two years. So, the growth is happening in the future. But the result of that is that two years from now, the population is double what it was one year ago.\n\nWait, okay, so let's make a timeline:\n\n- Let\u2019s consider the current time as year 0. So, the population is P0.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"two years from now\" and \"one year ago.\" Oh, wait, I think I need to think in terms of past and future.\n\nWait, perhaps I should define the population one year ago as P. Then, the population now is P plus whatever it increased last year. Wait, but the problem states that the projection is for the next two years. So maybe the current population is P, and the projections are for the next two years, but the result is about two years from now being double the population of one year ago.\n\nLet me try to model it step by step.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet P be the population one year ago. So, the current population (this year) would be P plus a certain percentage increase from last year. But wait, the problem says that the projection is for the next two years, meaning that the increase is expected to start now. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the timeline.\n\nWait, the problem says that the population is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. So, from now, in the next two years, the population will go up by 10% each year.\n\nBut the effect of this is that two years from now, the population will be double what it was one year ago. So, the population two years from now is twice the population of one year ago.\n\nWait, let me think in terms of steps:\n\n- Let's denote:\n\n   - P = population one year ago.\n\n   - Then, the current population (this year) would be P plus whatever it increased last year. But wait, the problem doesn't mention last year's growth except for the question about the last year's increase, which is what we're trying to find. So perhaps the current population is P, and the projections are for the next two years.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model it like this:\n\nLet\u2019s define the population one year ago as P. So, this is the population at time t-1.\n\nThe current population (time t) is P multiplied by (1 + x), where x is the growth rate from last year to now. The problem is asking for x, which is the percentage increase over the last year.\n\nThen, the projection is for the next two years. So, the population will increase by 10% each year. So, next year (t+1) will be current population * 1.10. Then, the year after that (t+2) will be (current population * 1.10) * 1.10 = current population * (1.10)^2.\n\nThe problem states that the population two years from now (t+2) will be exactly double the population of one year ago (t-1). So, t+2 population is 2 * P.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\nPopulation at t+2 = Population at t * (1.10)^2 = 2 * P.\n\nBut Population at t is P * (1 + x).\n\nSo:\n\nP * (1 + x) * (1.10)^2 = 2 * P.\n\nI can cancel P from both sides since P is non-zero.\n\nSo:\n\n(1 + x) * (1.10)^2 = 2.\n\nLet me compute (1.10)^2 first. 1.1 * 1.1 is 1.21.\n\nSo:\n\n(1 + x) * 1.21 = 2.\n\nDivide both sides by 1.21:\n\n1 + x = 2 / 1.21.\n\nWhat's 2 divided by 1.21? Let me calculate that.\n\nWell, 1.21 is 121/100, so 2 / (121/100) = 2 * (100/121) = 200/121 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSo:\n\n1 + x \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSubtract 1:\n\nx \u2248 0.65289, which is 65.289%.\n\nWait, but the options are A)20%, B)40%, C)50%, D)65%, E)75%.\n\nSo, 65.289% is very close to 65%, which is option D.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, I defined P as the population one year ago. The current population is P * (1 + x), where x is the growth rate from last year to now.\n\nThen, over the next two years, it grows by 10% each year. So, after one year, it's (P*(1+x)) *1.1, and after two years, it's (P*(1+x)) *1.1^2.\n\nThe problem says that this two-year future population equals double the population one year ago, which is 2P.\n\nSo, equation is:\n\nP*(1+x)*(1.1)^2 = 2P.\n\nCancel P, correct.\n\nCompute (1.1)^2 = 1.21.\n\nSo (1+x) = 2 / 1.21 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSo x \u2248 0.65289, which is 65.289%, so about 65%, which is option D.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the percent increase over the last year, which is x, which is approximately 65%. So the answer would be D)65%.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Did I define the variables correctly?\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe I should model the timeline differently.\n\nSuppose the population two years from now is double the population one year ago.\n\nLet me think: If I call the population one year ago as P, then two years from now, it's 2P.\n\nBut over the next two years, the population increases by 10% each year.\n\nWait, let me think of the current time as one year ago. Hmm, perhaps that's complicating it. Alternatively, perhaps I should model it as:\n\nLet me think of the current population as P0. Then, next year, it's P0 * 1.10. The year after that, it's P0 * (1.10)^2.\n\nBut the problem says that two years from now, the population is double what it was one year ago.\n\nSo, one year ago, the population was P0 / 1.10 (assuming it increased by 10% last year). So, the population one year ago is P0 / 1.10.\n\nThen, two years from now, the population is P0 * (1.10)^2.\n\nAccording to the problem, this equals 2 * (P0 / 1.10).\n\nSo:\n\nP0 * (1.10)^2 = 2 * (P0 / 1.10).\n\nDivide both sides by P0: (1.10)^2 = 2 / 1.10.\n\nCompute (1.10)^2 = 1.21.\n\nSo 1.21 = 2 / 1.10.\n\nWait, 2 divided by 1.10 is approximately 1.81818.\n\nWait, but 1.21 is not equal to 1.81818. That can't be right. So perhaps my initial approach was wrong.\n\nWait, so maybe my variables were defined incorrectly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the current population as P. Then, one year ago, the population was P / (1 + x), where x is the growth rate last year. Then, two years from now, the population would be P * (1.10)^2.\n\nAnd the problem states that this equals 2 * (P / (1 + x)).\n\nWait, let me write the equation:\n\nP * (1.1)^2 = 2 * (P / (1 + x)).\n\nCancel P from both sides:\n\n(1.1)^2 = 2 / (1 + x).\n\nSo 1.21 = 2 / (1 + x).\n\nSolving for (1 + x):\n\n1 + x = 2 / 1.21 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSo x \u2248 0.65289, which is about 65.29%, same as before.\n\nSo the growth rate last year was approximately 65%, which is option D.\n\nHmm, so why did I get confused earlier? Because I was trying to model the population one year ago as P, but perhaps it's better to model the current population as P.\n\nWait, but in the first approach, I defined P as the population one year ago. Then, current population is P*(1+x), and two years from now it's P*(1+x)*(1.1)^2 = 2P. That led me to the same result.\n\nSo the answer should be D)65%.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the problem statement. It says that the projection is for the next two years. So the current population is now, and over the next two years, it's increasing by 10% each year.\n\nSo, the current population is P0.\n\nIn one year: P0 * 1.10.\n\nIn two years: P0 * (1.10)^2.\n\nThe problem states that the population two years from now is double the population one year ago.\n\nOne year ago, the population was P0 / (1 + x), where x is last year's growth rate.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\nP0 * (1.10)^2 = 2 * (P0 / (1 + x)).\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n1.21 = 2/(1 + x).\n\nSo 1 + x = 2/1.21 \u22481.65289.\n\nx \u2248 0.65289 \u2192 65.289%.\n\nSo the correct answer is D)65%.\n",

So, the population one year ago is P0 / 1.10.\n\nThen, two years from now, the population is P0 * (1.10)^2.\n\nAccording to the problem, this equals 2 * (P0 / 1.10).\n\nSo:\n\nP0 * (1.10)^2 = 2 * (P0 / 1.10).\n\nDivide both sides by P0: (1.10)^2 = 2 / 1.10.\n\nCompute (1.10)^2 = 1.21.\n\nSo 1.21 = 2 / 1.10.\n\nWait, 2 divided by 1.10 is approximately 1.81818.\n\nWait, but 1.21 is not equal to 1.81818. That can't be right. So perhaps my initial approach was wrong.\n\nWait, so maybe my variables were defined incorrectly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the current population as P. Then, one year ago, the population was P / (1 + x), where x is the growth rate last year. Then, two years from now, the population would be P * (1.10)^2.\n\nAnd the problem states that this equals 2 * (P / (1 + x)).\n\nWait, let me write the equation:\n\nP * (1.1)^2 = 2 * (P / (1 + x)).\n\nCancel P from both sides:\n\n(1.1)^2 = 2 / (1 + x).\n\nSo 1.21 = 2 / (1 + x).\n\nSolving for (1 + x):\n\n1 + x = 2 / 1.21 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSo x \u2248 0.65289, which is about 65.29%, same as before.\n\nSo the growth rate last year was approximately 65%, which is option D.\n\nHmm, so why did I get confused earlier? Because I was trying to model the population one year ago as P, but perhaps it's better to model the current population as P.\n\nWait, but in the first approach, I defined P as the population one year ago. Then, current population is P*(1+x), and two years from now it's P*(1+x)*(1.1)^2 = 2P. That led me to the same result.\n\nSo the answer should be D)65%.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the problem statement. It says that the projection is for the next two years. So the current population is now, and over the next two years, it's increasing by 10% each year.\n\nSo, the current population is P0.\n\nIn one year: P0 * 1.10.\n\nIn two years: P0 * (1.10)^2.\n\nThe problem states that the population two years from now is double the population one year ago.\n\nOne year ago, the population was P0 / (1 + x), where x is last year's growth rate.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\nP0 * (1.10)^2 = 2 * (P0 / (1 + x)).\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n1.21 = 2/(1 + x).\n\nSo 1 + x = 2/1.21 \u22481.65289.\n\nx \u2248 0.65289 \u2192 65.289%.\n\nSo the correct answer is D)65%.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we define the population one year ago as \\( P \\). The current population is then \\( P \\times (1 + x) \\), where \\( x \\) is the percentage increase in population over the last year. Over the next two years, the population is expected to grow by 10% each year. Therefore, the population two years from now will be:\n\n\\[\nP \\times (1 + x) \\times (1.10)^2\n\\]\n\nThe problem states that this population two years from now will be exactly double the population one year ago, which is \\( 2P \\). Thus, we set up the equation:\n\n\\[\nP \\times (1 + x) \\times (1.10)^2 = 2P\n\\]\n\nCanceling \\( P \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n(1 + x) \\times (1.10)^2 = 2\n\\]\n\nWe compute \\( (1.10)^2 = 1.21 \\), so:\n\n\\[\n(1 + x) \\times 1.21 = 2\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 1.21:\n\n\\[\n1 + x = \\frac{2}{1.21} \\approx 1.65289\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 1 from both sides:\n\n\\[\nx \\approx 0.65289\n\\]\n\nThis corresponds to a percentage increase of approximately \\( 65.29\\% \\). Among the given options, the closest value is \\( 65\\% \\), which corresponds to option D.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about population growth in Boomtown. Let me try to understand what's going on. The question says that the population is expected to increase by 10% each year for the next two years. And if that happens, the population two years from now will be exactly double what it was one year ago. I need to find the percent increase in the population over the last year, and the options are A)20%, B)40%, C)50%, D)65%, E)75%.\n\nHmm, wait. Let me think step by step. Maybe I should model the population changes using variables. Let's say the current population is P. But wait, no, wait. The problem refers to the population one year ago and two years from now. So perhaps I should define variables based on the timeline.\n\nLet me consider the timeline. Let's say the current time is year 0. Then, one year ago would be year -1, and two years from now would be year +2.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the population at different points in time. Let me define P as the population one year ago. So, one year ago, the population was P.\n\nNow, the planners expect a 10% increase each year for the next two years. So, from the current time (which is one year after P), the population will increase by 10% each year for two years. Let me break that down.\n\nWait, wait. Let me clarify the timeline. Let's say the current population is P0. So, one year ago, the population was P0 divided by 1.10, because it's 10% less than now. Wait, no, maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should model the population at different times.\n\nLet me think. Let\u2019s define:\n\n- Let\u2019s say the population one year ago (time t-1) was P.\n\n- Then, the current population (time t) is P increased by 10%, so P * 1.10.\n\n- Then, in the next year (time t+1), it increases another 10%, so it's P * 1.10 * 1.10 = P * (1.10)^2.\n\nWait, but the problem says that two years from now, the population would be double that of one year ago. So, the population two years from now is P * (1.10)^2, and this equals twice the population one year ago, which is 2P.\n\nSo, according to the problem, P * (1.10)^2 = 2P.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because if I set up that equation, I can solve for P, but perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-read the question. It says the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. So, two years from now, the population is 2 times the population one year ago.\n\nSo, if I denote:\n\nPopulation one year ago (t-1) = P.\n\nPopulation now (t) = P * 1.10.\n\nPopulation next year (t+1) = P * 1.10 * 1.10 = P * 1.21.\n\nPopulation the year after that (t+2) = P * 1.21 * 1.10 = P * 1.331.\n\nWait, wait. No, that's incorrect. Because if each year's population is 10% higher than the previous, then each year multiplies by 1.10.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as:\n\nLet me think again. Let me define P as the population one year ago (t-1). Then, the current population (t) is P + 10% of P = P * 1.10.\n\nNext year (t+1): 10% increase on current population, so 1.10 * (1.10 P) = 1.21 P.\n\nThe year after that (t+2): another 10% increase, so 1.10 * 1.21 P = 1.331 P.\n\nBut according to the problem, the population two years from now (t+2) is exactly double the population one year ago (t-1). So:\n\n1.331 P = 2 * P.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 1.331 P is equal to 2 P only if 1.331 = 2, which is not true. So I must have made a mistake in setting up the variables.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the time frames. Let me try again.\n\nLet me instead define the current population as P. Then, one year ago, the population was P / 1.10. Because if last year's population was P_prev, and this year's is P_prev * 1.10 = P. So P_prev = P / 1.10.\n\nNow, for the next two years, the population increases by 10% each year. So next year (year 1), population is P * 1.10. Year 2 (two years from now) is P * 1.10^2.\n\nAccording to the problem, the population two years from now is double the population of one year ago. One year ago, the population was P_prev = P / 1.10.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\nPopulation two years from now = 2 * population one year ago.\n\nWhich is:\n\nP * (1.10)^2 = 2 * (P / 1.10).\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nCompute (1.10)^2: 1.21.\n\nSo:\n\nP * 1.21 = 2 * (P / 1.10).\n\nDivide both sides by P (assuming P is not zero):\n\n1.21 = 2 / 1.10.\n\nLet me compute 2 / 1.10. 2 divided by 1.1 is approximately 1.81818...\n\nBut 1.21 is approximately 1.21, which is less than 1.818. So this can't be correct. So maybe I messed up the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in defining the variables. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet P be the population one year ago (t-1).\n\nThen, current population (t) is P * 1.10.\n\nNext year (t+1): 1.10 * (current) = 1.10 * 1.10 P = 1.21 P.\n\nYear after that (t+2): 1.10 * 1.21 P = 1.331 P.\n\nAccording to the problem, population two years from now (t+2) is double that of one year ago (t-1). So:\n\n1.331 P = 2 * P.\n\nWait, that implies 1.331 = 2, which is impossible. So perhaps my initial setup is wrong.\n\nHmm, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me think about the timeline again.\n\nSuppose the current time is t=0.\n\nLet me define P0 as the population at time t=0.\n\nThe problem says that over the next two years, the population increases by 10% each year. So:\n\nAt t=1, population is P0 * 1.10.\n\nAt t=2, population is P0 * (1.10)^2.\n\nThe problem also says that the population two years from now (t=2) is exactly double the population one year ago (t=-1). So, P(t=2) = 2 * P(t=-1).\n\nBut wait, we don't know P(t=-1). So perhaps I need to express P(t=-1) in terms of P0.\n\nAt t=-1, which is one year before t=0, the population would be P0 / 1.10, assuming a 10% increase from t=-1 to t=0.\n\nSo, P(t=-1) = P0 / 1.10.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\nP(t=2) = 2 * P(t=-1).\n\nSubstituting the expressions:\n\nP0 * (1.10)^2 = 2 * (P0 / 1.10).\n\nLet me compute this.\n\nLeft side: P0 * 1.21.\n\nRight side: 2 * P0 / 1.10.\n\nSo,\n\n1.21 P0 = (2 / 1.10) P0.\n\nDivide both sides by P0 (assuming P0 \u22600):\n\n1.21 = 2 / 1.10.\n\nCompute 2 / 1.10. Let's compute that: 2 divided by 1.1 is approximately 1.81818...\n\nSo, 1.21 \u2248 1.81818? No, that's not correct. So, this suggests that the equation 1.21 = 1.818 is not valid. Therefore, my setup must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption that the population increases by 10% each year for the next two years is correct, but maybe the current population is different. Alternatively, perhaps the 10% growth is not from the current population but from the population one year ago.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's denote:\n\nLet P be the population one year ago.\n\nThen, the current population is P * 1.10.\n\nIn the next two years, each year increases by 10%, so:\n\nAfter first year (t=1), population is 1.10 * (1.10 P) = 1.21 P.\n\nAfter second year (t=2), population is 1.10 * 1.21 P = 1.331 P.\n\nThe problem states that at t=2, the population is double that of one year ago (which was P).\n\nSo,\n\n1.331 P = 2 * P.\n\nWait, but that would imply 1.331 P = 2 P \u2192 1.331 = 2, which is impossible. So, I must have made a wrong assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the 10% increase is over the next two years, meaning that each year the increase is 10% of the original population? No, that's not how percentage increases work. Each year's increase is based on the current population.\n\nHmm, maybe I should set up the equation without assuming that the current population is 10% higher than one year ago. Wait, but that's the given projection.\n\nWait, let's try a different approach. Let me define the population one year ago as P. Then, the current population is P * 1.10. Then, next year (t+1) it's 1.10 * (current) = 1.10 * 1.10 P = 1.21 P. The year after that (t+2) is 1.10 * 1.21 P = 1.331 P. According to the problem, this equals 2 * P (double the population one year ago).\n\nSo, 1.331 P = 2 P \u2192 1.331 = 2 \u2192 which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that the current population can't be 1.1 P if the two-year projection leads to double the population one year ago.\n\nSo, perhaps my initial assumption about the current population is incorrect. Maybe the 10% increase is not from the current population but from a different starting point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the population one year ago is P, and the current population is P, and the next two years have 10% increases. Wait, that's another possibility. Maybe I'm getting the timeline wrong.\n\nWait, let me re-express the problem. The problem states: \"the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.\"\n\nSo, perhaps one year ago is before the current time. So, let's think of the current population as P. Then, one year ago, the population was P_prev = P / 1.10.\n\nIn the next two years, the population increases by 10% each year. So, the population after one year is P * 1.10. After two years, it's P * 1.10^2.\n\nAccording to the problem, two years from now, the population is 2 * P_prev.\n\nSo,\n\nP * (1.10)^2 = 2 * (P / 1.10).\n\nLet me compute this equation.\n\nLeft side: P * 1.21.\n\nRight side: 2P / 1.10 \u2248 1.81818 P.\n\nSo,\n\n1.21 P = 1.81818 P \u2192 1.21 = 1.81818 \u2192 which is not true. So, this suggests that my setup is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I'm assuming the current population is P, but the 10% increases are over the next two years, so the current population is not necessarily 10% higher than one year ago. Or perhaps the 10% increases are applied to the population one year ago.\n\nWait, maybe the current population is P. Then, one year ago, the population was P / 1.10.\n\nThe next two years will have 10% increases each. So, population after first year: P * 1.10.\n\nPopulation after two years: P * (1.10)^2.\n\nThe problem states that this equals 2 * P_prev, which is 2*(P/1.10).\n\nSo,\n\nP * 1.21 = 2 * (P/1.10).\n\nDivide both sides by P:\n\n1.21 = 2 / 1.10 \u2192 2/1.10 is approximately 1.81818.\n\nBut 1.21 is not equal to 1.81818. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, so perhaps the mistake is that I'm using the same P for both the current and the past. Maybe I should model the population differently.\n\nAlternative approach: Let me denote the population one year ago as x. Then, the current population is x * 1.10.\n\nIn the next two years, each year's population increases by 10%, so:\n\nAfter one year: (x * 1.10) * 1.10 = x * 1.21.\n\nAfter two years: (x * 1.21) * 1.10 = x * 1.331.\n\nAccording to the problem, this equals double the population one year ago. So,\n\nx * 1.331 = 2 * x.\n\nDivide both sides by x: 1.331 = 2 \u2192 which is impossible.\n\nHmm, this suggests that my initial approach is flawed. But the problem states that this projection is correct, so perhaps my understanding of the timeline is wrong.\n\nWait a second. Let me re-read the question.\n\nThe problem says: \"the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the 'one year ago' refers to before the two years of growth. So, perhaps the two years of growth bring the population to double the population one year prior to the start of the two-year period.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nSuppose the two-year period starts at time t, and ends at time t+2.\n\nAt time t, the population is P.\n\nOne year before the start of the two-year period (time t-1), the population was P_prev.\n\nAccording to the problem, after two years of 10% growth, the population at t+2 is 2 * P_prev.\n\nSo:\n\nPopulation at t+2 = P * (1.10)^2 = 2 * P_prev.\n\nBut we need to relate P_prev to P.\n\nIf the growth rate is 10% per year, then from t-1 to t, the population increased by 10%, so P = P_prev * 1.10 \u2192 P_prev = P / 1.10.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nP * (1.10)^2 = 2 * (P / 1.10).\n\nSimplify:\n\n1.21 P = (2 / 1.10) P.\n\nDivide both sides by P:\n\n1.21 = 2 / 1.10 \u2192 2 / 1.10 is approximately 1.81818.\n\nBut 1.21 \u2248 1.81818 is not true. So something's wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the growth rate is applied differently. Maybe the 10% increase is not from the previous year but from an earlier point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 10% per year is for the next two years, meaning the current population is not growing at 10% right now but will start to grow in the next two years.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the problem says the planners expect a 10% increase per year over the next two years. So the current population is P, and next year it's P * 1.10, and the year after that P * 1.21.\n\nBut according to the problem, two years from now it's 2 * (P_prev), where P_prev is the population one year ago.\n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should approach it algebraically.\n\nLet me let P_prev be the population one year ago. Then the current population is P_prev * 1.10.\n\nIn the next two years, each year increases by 10%, so:\n\nAfter first year: 1.10 * (1.10 P_prev) = 1.21 P_prev.\n\nAfter second year: 1.10 * 1.21 P_prev = 1.331 P_prev.\n\nAccording to the problem, 1.331 P_prev = 2 * P_prev.\n\nWhich implies 1.331 = 2, which is impossible. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the population one year ago is not P_prev but a different variable. Maybe the problem is that the current population is P, and one year ago, the population was P / 1.10. Then, two years from now, it's P * 1.21.\n\nSo, the equation is P * 1.21 = 2 * (P / 1.10).\n\nSo,\n\n1.21 = 2 / 1.10 \u2192 2/1.10 is approximately 1.81818. So 1.21 \u2248 1.81818. That's not possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the 10% increase is applied to the population one year ago each year. So, each of the next two years, the population increases by 10% of the population one year ago.\n\nIn that case, after the first year, the population would be P_prev * 1.10.\n\nAfter the second year, it would be P_prev * 1.10^2.\n\nSo, two years from now, the population is P_prev * 1.21.\n\nAccording to the problem, this equals 2 * P_prev.\n\nSo,\n\n1.21 P_prev = 2 P_prev \u2192 1.21 = 2 \u2192 again impossible.\n\nHmm, I'm going in circles. Maybe I should consider that the population one year ago is P, and the current population is P * (1 + x), where x is the growth rate over the last year. The next two years, the growth rate is 10% each year.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the growth rate over the last year, not the next two years. Oh wait, no. The question is about the population increase over the last year. Wait, let me check the question again.\n\nThe question says: \"Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year?\"\n\nWait, so the last year is the year before the current one. So, the population one year ago (P_prev) increased to the current population (P). So, the growth rate over the last year is (P - P_prev) / P_prev * 100%.\n\nBut how does that tie into the two-year projection?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the current population is P, and one year ago it was P_prev. Then, the next two years will have 10% increases each. So, after two years, the population is P * 1.21. According to the problem, this equals 2 * P_prev.\n\nSo,\n\nP * 1.21 = 2 * P_prev.\n\nBut P_prev is the population one year ago, which is P / (1 + r), where r is the growth rate over the last year.\n\nWait, let me define r as the growth rate over the last year. So, P_prev = P / (1 + r).\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nP * 1.21 = 2 * (P / (1 + r)).\n\nDivide both sides by P:\n\n1.21 = 2 / (1 + r).\n\nMultiply both sides by (1 + r):\n\n1.21 (1 + r) = 2.\n\nDivide both sides by 1.21:\n\n1 + r = 2 / 1.21.\n\nCompute 2 / 1.21.\n\n1.21 is 121/100, so 2 / (121/100) = 200/121 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSo,\n\n1 + r \u2248 1.65289 \u2192 r \u2248 0.65289, which is approximately 65.289%.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 65%, which is the closest.\n\nSo, the percent increase over the last year is approximately 65%.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the population growth in Boomtown over time.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about population growth in Boomtown. Let me try to understand what's going on. The question says that the population is expected to increase by 10% each year for the next two years. And if that happens, the population two years from now will be exactly double what it was one year ago. I need to find the percent increase in the population over the last year, and the options are A)20%, B)40%, C)50%, D)65%, E)75%.\n\nHmm, wait. Let me think step by step. Maybe I should model the population changes using variables. Let's say the current population is P. But wait, no, wait. The problem refers to the population one year ago and two years from now. So perhaps I should define variables based on the timeline.\n\nLet me consider the timeline. Let's say the current time is year 0. Then, one year ago would be year -1, and two years from now would be year +2.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the population at different points in time. Let me define P as the population one year ago. So, one year ago, the population was P.\n\nNow, the planners expect a 10% increase each year for the next two years. So, from the current time (which is one year after P), the population will increase by 10% each year for two years. Let me break that down.\n\nWait, wait. Let me clarify the timeline. Let's say the current population is P0. So, one year ago, the population was P0 divided by 1.10, because it's 10% less than now. Wait, no, maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should model the population at different times.\n\nLet me think. Let\u2019s define:\n\n- Let\u2019s say the population one year ago (time t-1) was P.\n\n- Then, the current population (time t) is P increased by 10%, so P * 1.10.\n\n- Then, in the next year (time t+1), it increases another 10%, so it's P * 1.10 * 1.10 = P * (1.10)^2.\n\nWait, but the problem says that two years from now, the population would be double that of one year ago. So, the population two years from now is P * (1.10)^2, and this equals twice the population one year ago, which is 2P.\n\nSo, according to the problem, P * (1.10)^2 = 2P.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because if I set up that equation, I can solve for P, but perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-read the question. It says the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. So, two years from now, the population is 2 times the population one year ago.\n\nSo, if I denote:\n\nPopulation one year ago (t-1) = P.\n\nPopulation now (t) = P * 1.10.\n\nPopulation next year (t+1) = P * 1.10 * 1.10 = P * 1.21.\n\nPopulation the year after that (t+2) = P * 1.21 * 1.10 = P * 1.331.\n\nWait, wait. No, that's incorrect. Because if each year's population is 10% higher than the previous, then each year multiplies by 1.10.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as:\n\nLet me think again. Let me define P as the population one year ago (t-1). Then, the current population (t) is P + 10% of P = P * 1.10.\n\nNext year (t+1): 10% increase on current population, so 1.10 * (1.10 P) = 1.21 P.\n\nThe year after that (t+2): another 10% increase, so 1.10 * 1.21 P = 1.331 P.\n\nBut according to the problem, the population two years from now (t+2) is exactly double the population one year ago (t-1). So:\n\n1.331 P = 2 * P.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 1.331 P is equal to 2 P only if 1.331 = 2, which is not true. So I must have made a mistake in setting up the variables.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the time frames. Let me try again.\n\nLet me instead define the current population as P. Then, one year ago, the population was P / 1.10. Because if last year's population was P_prev, and this year's is P_prev * 1.10 = P. So P_prev = P / 1.10.\n\nNow, for the next two years, the population increases by 10% each year. So next year (year 1), population is P * 1.10. Year 2 (two years from now) is P * 1.10^2.\n\nAccording to the problem, the population two years from now is double the population of one year ago. One year ago, the population was P_prev = P / 1.10.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\nPopulation two years from now = 2 * population one year ago.\n\nWhich is:\n\nP * (1.10)^2 = 2 * (P / 1.10).\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nCompute (1.10)^2: 1.21.\n\nSo:\n\nP * 1.21 = 2 * (P / 1.10).\n\nDivide both sides by P (assuming P is not zero):\n\n1.21 = 2 / 1.10.\n\nLet me compute 2 / 1.10. 2 divided by 1.1 is approximately 1.81818...\n\nBut 1.21 is approximately 1.21, which is less than 1.818. So this can't be correct. So maybe I messed up the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in defining the variables. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet P be the population one year ago (t-1).\n\nThen, current population (t) is P * 1.10.\n\nNext year (t+1): 1.10 * (current) = 1.10 * 1.10 P = 1.21 P.\n\nYear after that (t+2): 1.10 * 1.21 P = 1.331 P.\n\nAccording to the problem, population two years from now (t+2) is double that of one year ago (t-1). So:\n\n1.331 P = 2 * P.\n\nWait, that implies 1.331 = 2, which is impossible. So perhaps my initial setup is wrong.\n\nHmm, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me think about the timeline again.\n\nSuppose the current time is t=0.\n\nLet me define P0 as the population at time t=0.\n\nThe problem says that over the next two years, the population increases by 10% each year. So:\n\nAt t=1, population is P0 * 1.10.\n\nAt t=2, population is P0 * (1.10)^2.\n\nThe problem also says that the population two years from now (t=2) is exactly double the population one year ago (t=-1). So, P(t=2) = 2 * P(t=-1).\n\nBut wait, we don't know P(t=-1). So perhaps I need to express P(t=-1) in terms of P0.\n\nAt t=-1, which is one year before t=0, the population would be P0 / 1.10, assuming a 10% increase from t=-1 to t=0.\n\nSo, P(t=-1) = P0 / 1.10.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\nP(t=2) = 2 * P(t=-1).\n\nSubstituting the expressions:\n\nP0 * (1.10)^2 = 2 * (P0 / 1.10).\n\nLet me compute this.\n\nLeft side: P0 * 1.21.\n\nRight side: 2 * P0 / 1.10.\n\nSo,\n\n1.21 P0 = (2 / 1.10) P0.\n\nDivide both sides by P0 (assuming P0 \u22600):\n\n1.21 = 2 / 1.10.\n\nCompute 2 / 1.10. Let's compute that: 2 divided by 1.1 is approximately 1.81818...\n\nSo, 1.21 \u2248 1.81818? No, that's not correct. So, this suggests that the equation 1.21 = 1.818 is not valid. Therefore, my setup must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption that the population increases by 10% each year for the next two years is correct, but maybe the current population is different. Alternatively, perhaps the 10% growth is not from the current population but from the population one year ago.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's denote:\n\nLet P be the population one year ago.\n\nThen, the current population is P * 1.10.\n\nIn the next two years, each year increases by 10%, so:\n\nAfter first year (t=1), population is 1.10 * (1.10 P) = 1.21 P.\n\nAfter second year (t=2), population is 1.10 * 1.21 P = 1.331 P.\n\nThe problem states that at t=2, the population is double that of one year ago (which was P).\n\nSo,\n\n1.331 P = 2 * P.\n\nWait, but that would imply 1.331 P = 2 P \u2192 1.331 = 2, which is impossible. So, I must have made a wrong assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the 10% increase is over the next two years, meaning that each year the increase is 10% of the original population? No, that's not how percentage increases work. Each year's increase is based on the current population.\n\nHmm, maybe I should set up the equation without assuming that the current population is 10% higher than one year ago. Wait, but that's the given projection.\n\nWait, let's try a different approach. Let me define the population one year ago as P. Then, the current population is P * 1.10. Then, next year (t+1) it's 1.10 * (current) = 1.10 * 1.10 P = 1.21 P. The year after that (t+2) is 1.10 * 1.21 P = 1.331 P. According to the problem, this equals 2 * P (double the population one year ago).\n\nSo, 1.331 P = 2 P \u2192 1.331 = 2 \u2192 which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that the current population can't be 1.1 P if the two-year projection leads to double the population one year ago.\n\nSo, perhaps my initial assumption about the current population is incorrect. Maybe the 10% increase is not from the current population but from a different starting point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the population one year ago is P, and the current population is P, and the next two years have 10% increases. Wait, that's another possibility. Maybe I'm getting the timeline wrong.\n\nWait, let me re-express the problem. The problem states: \"the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.\"\n\nSo, perhaps one year ago is before the current time. So, let's think of the current population as P. Then, one year ago, the population was P_prev = P / 1.10.\n\nIn the next two years, the population increases by 10% each year. So, the population after one year is P * 1.10. After two years, it's P * 1.10^2.\n\nAccording to the problem, two years from now, the population is 2 * P_prev.\n\nSo,\n\nP * (1.10)^2 = 2 * (P / 1.10).\n\nLet me compute this equation.\n\nLeft side: P * 1.21.\n\nRight side: 2P / 1.10 \u2248 1.81818 P.\n\nSo,\n\n1.21 P = 1.81818 P \u2192 1.21 = 1.81818 \u2192 which is not true. So, this suggests that my setup is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I'm assuming the current population is P, but the 10% increases are over the next two years, so the current population is not necessarily 10% higher than one year ago. Or perhaps the 10% increases are applied to the population one year ago.\n\nWait, maybe the current population is P. Then, one year ago, the population was P / 1.10.\n\nThe next two years will have 10% increases each. So, population after first year: P * 1.10.\n\nPopulation after two years: P * (1.10)^2.\n\nThe problem states that this equals 2 * P_prev, which is 2*(P/1.10).\n\nSo,\n\nP * 1.21 = 2 * (P/1.10).\n\nDivide both sides by P:\n\n1.21 = 2 / 1.10 \u2192 2/1.10 is approximately 1.81818.\n\nBut 1.21 is not equal to 1.81818. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, so perhaps the mistake is that I'm using the same P for both the current and the past. Maybe I should model the population differently.\n\nAlternative approach: Let me denote the population one year ago as x. Then, the current population is x * 1.10.\n\nIn the next two years, each year's population increases by 10%, so:\n\nAfter one year: (x * 1.10) * 1.10 = x * 1.21.\n\nAfter two years: (x * 1.21) * 1.10 = x * 1.331.\n\nAccording to the problem, this equals double the population one year ago. So,\n\nx * 1.331 = 2 * x.\n\nDivide both sides by x: 1.331 = 2 \u2192 which is impossible.\n\nHmm, this suggests that my initial approach is flawed. But the problem states that this projection is correct, so perhaps my understanding of the timeline is wrong.\n\nWait a second. Let me re-read the question.\n\nThe problem says: \"the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the 'one year ago' refers to before the two years of growth. So, perhaps the two years of growth bring the population to double the population one year prior to the start of the two-year period.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nSuppose the two-year period starts at time t, and ends at time t+2.\n\nAt time t, the population is P.\n\nOne year before the start of the two-year period (time t-1), the population was P_prev.\n\nAccording to the problem, after two years of 10% growth, the population at t+2 is 2 * P_prev.\n\nSo:\n\nPopulation at t+2 = P * (1.10)^2 = 2 * P_prev.\n\nBut we need to relate P_prev to P.\n\nIf the growth rate is 10% per year, then from t-1 to t, the population increased by 10%, so P = P_prev * 1.10 \u2192 P_prev = P / 1.10.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nP * (1.10)^2 = 2 * (P / 1.10).\n\nSimplify:\n\n1.21 P = (2 / 1.10) P.\n\nDivide both sides by P:\n\n1.21 = 2 / 1.10 \u2192 2 / 1.10 is approximately 1.81818.\n\nBut 1.21 \u2248 1.81818 is not true. So something's wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the growth rate is applied differently. Maybe the 10% increase is not from the previous year but from an earlier point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 10% per year is for the next two years, meaning the current population is not growing at 10% right now but will start to grow in the next two years.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the problem says the planners expect a 10% increase per year over the next two years. So the current population is P, and next year it's P * 1.10, and the year after that P * 1.21.\n\nBut according to the problem, two years from now it's 2 * (P_prev), where P_prev is the population one year ago.\n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should approach it algebraically.\n\nLet me let P_prev be the population one year ago. Then the current population is P_prev * 1.10.\n\nIn the next two years, each year increases by 10%, so:\n\nAfter first year: 1.10 * (1.10 P_prev) = 1.21 P_prev.\n\nAfter second year: 1.10 * 1.21 P_prev = 1.331 P_prev.\n\nAccording to the problem, 1.331 P_prev = 2 * P_prev.\n\nWhich implies 1.331 = 2, which is impossible. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the population one year ago is not P_prev but a different variable. Maybe the problem is that the current population is P, and one year ago, the population was P / 1.10. Then, two years from now, it's P * 1.21.\n\nSo, the equation is P * 1.21 = 2 * (P / 1.10).\n\nSo,\n\n1.21 = 2 / 1.10 \u2192 2/1.10 is approximately 1.81818. So 1.21 \u2248 1.81818. That's not possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the 10% increase is applied to the population one year ago each year. So, each of the next two years, the population increases by 10% of the population one year ago.\n\nIn that case, after the first year, the population would be P_prev * 1.10.\n\nAfter the second year, it would be P_prev * 1.10^2.\n\nSo, two years from now, the population is P_prev * 1.21.\n\nAccording to the problem, this equals 2 * P_prev.\n\nSo,\n\n1.21 P_prev = 2 P_prev \u2192 1.21 = 2 \u2192 again impossible.\n\nHmm, I'm going in circles. Maybe I should consider that the population one year ago is P, and the current population is P * (1 + x), where x is the growth rate over the last year. The next two years, the growth rate is 10% each year.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the growth rate over the last year, not the next two years. Oh wait, no. The question is about the population increase over the last year. Wait, let me check the question again.\n\nThe question says: \"Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year?\"\n\nWait, so the last year is the year before the current one. So, the population one year ago (P_prev) increased to the current population (P). So, the growth rate over the last year is (P - P_prev) / P_prev * 100%.\n\nBut how does that tie into the two-year projection?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the current population is P, and one year ago it was P_prev. Then, the next two years will have 10% increases each. So, after two years, the population is P * 1.21. According to the problem, this equals 2 * P_prev.\n\nSo,\n\nP * 1.21 = 2 * P_prev.\n\nBut P_prev is the population one year ago, which is P / (1 + r), where r is the growth rate over the last year.\n\nWait, let me define r as the growth rate over the last year. So, P_prev = P / (1 + r).\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nP * 1.21 = 2 * (P / (1 + r)).\n\nDivide both sides by P:\n\n1.21 = 2 / (1 + r).\n\nMultiply both sides by (1 + r):\n\n1.21 (1 + r) = 2.\n\nDivide both sides by 1.21:\n\n1 + r = 2 / 1.21.\n\nCompute 2 / 1.21.\n\n1.21 is 121/100, so 2 / (121/100) = 200/121 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSo,\n\n1 + r \u2248 1.65289 \u2192 r \u2248 0.65289, which is approximately 65.289%.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 65%, which is the closest.\n\nSo, the percent increase over the last year is approximately 65%.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the population growth in Boomtown over time. Let the population one year ago be denoted as \\( P_{\\text{prev}} \\), and the current population as \\( P \\). The population is expected to grow by 10% per year for the next two years. According to the problem, the population two years from now will be exactly double the population one year ago.\n\n### Step 1: Express the population at different times\n1. **Current population (\\( P \\))**: This is the population at time \\( t \\).\n2. **Population one year ago (\\( P_{\\text{prev}} \\))**: This is the population at time \\( t-1 \\), and it relates to the current population as:\n   \\[\n   P = P_{\\text{prev}} \\cdot 1.10\n   \\]\n   Rearranging:\n   \\[\n   P_{\\text{prev}} = \\frac{P}{1.10}\n   \\]\n3. **Population two years from now (\\( P_{\\text{future}} \\))**: This is the population at time \\( t+2 \\), and it grows by 10% each year for the next two years:\n   \\[\n   P_{\\text{future}} = P \\cdot (1.10)^2 = P \\cdot 1.21\n   \\]\n\n### Step 2: Set up the equation based on the problem statement\nThe problem states that the population two years from now is exactly double the population one year ago:\n\\[\nP_{\\text{future}} = 2 \\cdot P_{\\text{prev}}\n\\]\nSubstitute the expressions for \\( P_{\\text{future}} \\) and \\( P_{\\text{prev}} \\):\n\\[\nP \\cdot 1.21 = 2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{P}{1.10}\\right)\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Simplify the equation\nDivide both sides by \\( P \\) (assuming \\( P \\neq 0 \\)):\n\\[\n1.21 = \\frac{2}{1.10}\n\\]\nCompute \\( \\frac{2}{1.10} \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{1.10} \\approx 1.81818\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\n1.21 = 1.81818\n\\]\nThis equation is not valid, which suggests an inconsistency in the setup. To resolve this, we redefine the problem by considering the growth rate over the last year.\n\n### Step 4: Define the growth rate over the last year\nLet \\( r \\) be the growth rate over the last year. The population one year ago (\\( P_{\\text{prev}} \\)) relates to the current population (\\( P \\)) as:\n\\[\nP = P_{\\text{prev}} \\cdot (1 + r)\n\\]\nRearranging:\n\\[\nP_{\\text{prev}} = \\frac{P}{1 + r}\n\\]\nSubstitute \\( P_{\\text{prev}} \\) into the equation for \\( P_{\\text{future}} \\):\n\\[\nP \\cdot 1.21 = 2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{P}{1 + r}\\right)\n\\]\nDivide both sides by \\( P \\):\n\\[\n1.21 = \\frac{2}{1 + r}\n\\]\nRearrange to solve for \\( r \\):\n\\[\n1 + r = \\frac{2}{1.21}\n\\]\nCompute \\( \\frac{2}{1.21} \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{1.21} \\approx 1.65289\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\nr \\approx 1.65289 - 1 = 0.65289\n\\]\nConvert to a percentage:\n\\[\nr \\approx 65.289\\%\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Compare with the options\nThe closest option to \\( 65.289\\% \\) is **65%**, which corresponds to option **D**.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year is approximately **65%**.\n\nAnswer: D",
