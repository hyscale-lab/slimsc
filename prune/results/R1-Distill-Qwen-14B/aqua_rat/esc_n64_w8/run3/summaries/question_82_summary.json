      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Julie's yard. Let me see if I can figure it out. So, the yard is rectangular, right? One side is 100 feet wide, and the area is 3,000 square feet. I need to find the length of the other side.\n\nHmm, I remember that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So the formula should be Area = Length \u00d7 Width. Oh wait, sometimes people get confused about which is length and which is width, but in this case, it doesn't matter as long as you multiply the two sides together.\n\nSo the problem says one side is 100 feet wide. Let's assume that's the width. Then the other side, which would be the length, is what we're looking for. Let me call the unknown side 'L' for length.\n\nThe area is given as 3,000 square feet. So plugging into the formula: 3000 = 100 \u00d7 L. Wait, wait, no, that's not right. Oh no, wait, wait. Because 100 feet is the width, and the other side is the length. So the formula should be 3000 = 100 (width) \u00d7 L (length).\n\nSo to solve for L, I should divide both sides by 100. So L = 3000 / 100. Let me calculate that. 3000 divided by 100 is 30. So the length should be 30 feet.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If the width is 100 feet and the length is 30 feet, then area would be 100 * 30 = 3000. Yep, that adds up. So the other side is 30 feet long.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 30 feet. So that should be the correct answer.\n",

Hmm, I remember that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length and width. So the formula is Area = length \u00d7 width. Right.\n\nThe problem says one side is 100 feet wide. Wait, so one side is 100 feet, but which side exactly? Oh, right, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So if one side is 100 feet, the opposite side is also 100 feet. But the other two sides must be the same length as each other.\n\nThe total area is 3,000 square feet. So I can plug that into the formula. Let me see, I have the area and one side, so I can find the other side. Oh right, rearranging the formula: length = area / width.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The problem says one side is 100 feet wide. So is that the width or the length? Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Oh, right, in rectangles, usually, the longer side is considered the length and the shorter one the width, but I don't think that's always the case. The problem just says one side is 100 feet wide. So perhaps, that's the width.\n\nWait, let me think again. If the width is 100 feet, then the length would be area divided by width. So area is 3000, width is 100. So 3000 divided by 100 equals 30. So the length would be 30 feet. But wait, that would make the width 100 and length 30, which would mean the yard is actually longer in width than length. That doesn't seem right because usually, the length is longer. But maybe the yard is a long and narrow one, so the width is 100, length 30. Hmm, but 30 is one of the options, option A.\n\nWait, but maybe I got the sides mixed up. What if the 100 feet is the length instead? Then the width would be 3000 / 100 = 30. But then the width is 30, which is shorter than the length. That makes more sense because the length is usually longer. So perhaps the 100 feet is the length, and the other side is 30 feet. Oh wait, but the problem says \"one side is 100 feet wide.\" Wait, wait, that's a crucial point. The term \"wide\" suggests it's the width. So if the side is 100 feet wide, then that's the width. So then the other side, the length, would be 3000 divided by 100, which is 30. But 30 is option A.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option E is 60, and others are 20, 10, 50, etc. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me double-check the calculation.\n\nArea = length \u00d7 width. If width is 100, then length is 3000 / 100 = 30. So that would make the other side 30 feet, which is option A.

So if the width is 100, then the length is 30, but that would make the yard 100 feet wide and 30 feet long.

But then the problem states that the side is 100 feet wide, which suggests that 100 is the width.

Oh right, in a rectangle, the area is length times width, so I can probably use that formula.\n\nWait, so area equals length multiplied by width. Oh wait, but in this case, the width is given as 100 feet. So the area is 3,000 square feet. So if I plug in the values, I can solve for the other side. Let me write that down.\n\nArea = length \u00d7 width. So, 3,000 = length \u00d7 100. Oh, wait, so I can rearrange that to find the length. So length = area divided by width. So that would be 3,000 divided by 100. Let me do that math.\n\n3,000 divided by 100 is 30. So the length should be 30 feet. Let me check the options. Option A is 30 feet. So that must be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The question says one side is 100 feet wide. Does that mean it's the width or the length? Oh, in a rectangle, the terms can be a bit confusing. But the problem states that one side is 100 feet wide, so I think that refers to the width. So the other side is the length. So yeah, 30 feet should be the correct length.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The calculation seems straightforward. 100 times 30 is 3,000, which matches the area given. So the other side is 30 feet. So the answer should be A.\n",
