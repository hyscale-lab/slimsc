      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about two trains leaving Mumbai Central for Lucknow. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with two objects moving towards the same direction, the relative speed is the difference between their speeds. But wait, in this case, both trains are going to the same destination, Lucknow, so they're moving in the same direction. So I guess I need to find the time when the faster train catches up with the slower one.\n\nWait, wait. Let me read the problem again. Train A leaves at 11 am at 40 kmph. Train B leaves at 2 pm at 72 kmph. Oh, right, so Train B starts later but is faster. So the question is, when will B catch up to A?\n\nFirst, I need to find out how far ahead Train A is by the time Train B starts moving. Because Train A has a two-hour head start. So in those two hours, how far does it go?\n\nDistance is speed multiplied by time. So for Train A, speed is 40 kmph, time is 2 hours. So 40 * 2 = 80 km. So when Train B starts at 2 pm, A is 80 km ahead.\n\nNow, the relative speed between B and A is the difference in their speeds. So 72 kmph minus 40 kmph is 32 kmph. That means every hour, Train B gains 32 km on Train A.\n\nSo the distance to cover is 80 km at a relative speed of 32 kmph. Time is distance divided by speed, so 80 / 32 = 2.5 hours. So it will take Train B 2.5 hours after 2 pm to catch up.\n\nWait, 2.5 hours is 2 hours and 30 minutes. So adding that to 2 pm. 2 pm plus 2 hours is 4 pm, plus 30 minutes is 4:30 pm. So the trains meet at 4:30 pm.\n\nNow, looking at the options: A is 12 am next day, which is way too late. B is 5 am next day, nope. C is 5 pm, which is later than 4:30. D is 2 pm next day, which is 24 hours later, so 2 pm next day would be 48 hours after 2 pm? Wait, no. Wait, no, D says 2 pm on the next day, which is same time as departure but the next day. So that would be 24 hours later. But our calculation is 2.5 hours after 2 pm, which is same day. So none of the options A to D match 4:30 pm. So the answer should be E) None of these.\n\nWait, but looking again at the options: Option C is 5 pm on the next day. That's 17:00. Hmm, no, wait. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, no. Let me recheck. The time after 2 pm is 2.5 hours. So 2 pm plus 2.5 hours is 4:30 pm on the same day. So the meeting time is 4:30 pm. Looking at the options, none of them have 4:30 pm. So the correct answer would be E, none of these.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about two trains leaving from the same station, Mumbai Central, heading to Lucknow. I need to find out when they'll meet each other. Hmm, let's see.\n\nTrain A leaves at 11 am going at 40 kmph. Train B leaves later, at 2 pm, but it's faster, going at 72 kmph. Both are on the same route, so they must be on a collision course, right? Or wait, maybe they're on opposite tracks but same direction? No, same route, same direction, so one is behind the other and catches up. So the faster one will catch up with the slower one.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Since both are going to Lucknow, same direction, Train B leaves later but is faster. So it will catch up with Train A. So I need to find the time when Train B catches up.\n\nBut first, I need to figure out how much distance Train A has covered before Train B even starts. Because Train A has a two-hour head start. Let me calculate that.\n\nTrain A's speed is 40 kmph. So in two hours, it would have covered 40 * 2 = 80 km. Right? Because distance equals speed multiplied by time. So at 2 pm, when Train B starts, Train A is already 80 km ahead on the route.\n\nNow, from 2 pm onwards, both are moving towards Lucknow. But Train B is faster. So the relative speed between them is the difference in their speeds. Because they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed is (72 - 40) kmph. Let's calculate that: 72 minus 40 is 32 kmph. So every hour, Train B is closing the gap by 32 km.\n\nThe initial gap when Train B starts is 80 km. So how much time will it take for Train B to cover this 80 km gap at a relative speed of 32 kmph?\n\nTime = distance / speed. So time = 80 / 32. Let me compute that. 80 divided by 32 is the same as 10 divided by 4, which is 2.5 hours. Wait, no, 32 times 2 is 64, 32 times 2.5 is 80. Yes, that's right. So 2.5 hours after 2 pm is when they meet.\n\nSo 2.5 hours is 2 hours and 30 minutes. Adding that to 2 pm: 2 pm plus 2 hours is 4 pm, plus 30 minutes makes 4:30 pm. So the trains meet at 4:30 pm.\n\nLooking at the options, the choices are:\n\nA) 12 am next day \u2014 that's way later.\nB)5 am next day \u2014 way too early.\nC)5 pm next day \u2014 5 pm is later than 4:30, so that's not it.\nD)2 pm next day \u2014 that's 24 hours later, same time next day, but we're only adding 2.5 hours.\nE)None of these \u2014 because the answer isn't listed, but wait, let me check the options again.\n\nWait, the options are A to E. Let me see. The options don't have 4:30 pm. So the correct time isn't in the options, which means the answer is E) None of these.\n\nWait, but did I make a mistake in my calculations? Let me double-check.\n\nTime difference between departure: 2 pm minus 11 am is 3 hours. So Train A has been traveling for 3 hours before Train B starts. Oh wait wait, no! Wait a second. Wait, Train A leaves at 11 am. Train B leaves at 2 pm. So the time between 11 am and 2 pm is 3 hours. So Train A has a 3-hour head start, not 2.\n\nOh! I think I made a mistake earlier. I thought it was 2 hours, but it's 3 hours. So the distance covered by Train A in 3 hours is 40 *3 = 120 km.\n\nSo the initial gap is 120 km. Then, the relative speed is 72-40=32 kmph. Time to cover 120 km at 32 kmph is 120 /32 hours. Let me compute that.\n\n120 divided by 32. Let's see, 32*3=96, 32*3.75= 120 (because 32 * 0.75 is 24, so 96+24=120). So 3.75 hours is the time after 2 pm.\n\n3.75 hours is 3 hours and 45 minutes. Adding that to 2 pm: 2 pm +3 hours is 5 pm, plus 45 minutes makes 5:45 pm.\n\nSo the trains meet at 5:45 pm. Now, looking at the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA)12 am next day \u2014 no\nB)5 am \u2014 no\nC)5 pm \u2014 no, because 5:45 is after 5 pm.\nD)2 pm next day \u2014 no, that's 24 hours later.\nE)None of these \u2014 yes, because 5:45 pm isn't listed.\n\nWait, but looking back, maybe I made a mistake in the time difference. Let me check again.\n\nTrain A departs at 11 am, Train B at 2 pm. The time between is 3 hours. So Train A has a 3-hour head start, not 2. So yeah, I think I messed up the initial calculation.\n\nSo the correct meeting time is 5:45 pm. The options don't have that, so the answer is E) None of these.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Did I compute the time correctly?\n\nTime after 2 pm is 3.75 hours. Let me confirm that.\n\n3.75 hours is 3 hours and 45 minutes. Adding to 2 pm: 2 pm +3h is 5 pm, plus 45 min is 5:45 pm.\n\nSo yeah, 5:45 pm. Looking at the options, option C is 5 pm, which is earlier than the meeting time. So the correct time isn't among the options. So the answer is E.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about two trains leaving from the same station, Mumbai Central, going to Lucknow. I need to find out when they'll meet each other. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nTrain A leaves at 11 am going at 40 kmph. Train B leaves later, at 2 pm, going faster at 72 kmph. Both are on the same route, so they must meet somewhere along the track. Wait, but since B leaves later, it's going to catch up to A, right?\n\nSo first, I should figure out the time difference between when A and B leave. From 11 am to 2 pm is 3 hours. So when B starts at 2 pm, A has already been traveling for 3 hours. Let me calculate how far A has gone by then.\n\nA's speed is 40 km/h, so in 3 hours, it would have covered 40 * 3 = 120 km. So at 2 pm, the distance between A and B is 120 km. Now, B is faster, so it's going to start closing that gap.\n\nNext, I need to find out the relative speed between the two trains. Since they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference between their speeds. So 72 kmph minus 40 kmph is 32 kmph. That means B is catching up at 32 km every hour.\n\nWait, but the gap is 120 km. So the time it'll take for B to catch up is the distance divided by the relative speed. Time = 120 / 32. Let me calculate that. 120 divided by 32 is the same as 3.75 hours. Because 32 times 3 is 96, and 32 times 4 is 128. So 120-96 is 24, so 24/32 is 0.75. So total 3.75 hours.\n\nWait, 3.75 hours is 3 hours and 45 minutes. So adding that time to 2 pm. 2 pm plus 3 hours is 5 pm, then plus 45 minutes would make it 5:45 pm. Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see a 5:45 pm option. The options are 5 pm, 5 am, etc. So maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Maybe I messed up the relative speed part. Oh, no, same direction, so yes, relative speed is 72-40=32 kmph. The distance at 2 pm is 120 km. Time is 120 /32=3.75 hours, which is 3h45m. So from 2 pm, adding 3h45m gives 5:45 pm.\n\nBut the options don't have 5:45 pm. Let's check the options again. Option C is 5 pm, which is earlier than 5:45. So that can't be right. Hmm, maybe I made an error in calculations.\n\nWait, let me recalculate 120 divided by 32. 32 * 3.75 = 120? Let me see. 32 *3 is 96, 32 *0.75 is 24. 96 +24=120. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the time they meet. So the meeting time would be 5:45 pm. But looking at the options, the closest is option C, which is 5 pm. So that's not matching. What are the options again?\n\nOptions:\nA) 12 am next day\nB)5 am next day\nC)5 pm next day\nD)2 pm next day\nE) None of these\n\nWait, none of the options have 5:45 pm, so the correct answer would be E) None of these.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the time. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that I considered the relative speed correctly, but perhaps I should have considered the time differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should model the problem with equations.\n\nLet me set up equations for the distances covered by each train. Let t be the time in hours after 2 pm when they meet.\n\nSo, the distance covered by train A by then is the distance it traveled in the 3 hours before 2 pm plus the distance it travels in t hours. So A's total distance is 120 km + 40 * t.\n\nTrain B's distance is 72 * t.\n\nWhen they meet, their distances from Mumbai Central are equal. So:\n\n120 + 40t = 72t\n\nLet's solve for t.\n\n120 = 72t -40t\n120 =32t\nt=120/32 = 3.75 hours. Which is the same as before. So 3.75 hours after 2 pm is 5:45 pm.\n\nSo none of the options match.

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the details: Train A leaves Mumbai Central for Lucknow at 11 am, going at 40 km/h. Train B leaves the same station on the same route at 2 pm, which is three hours later, and it's faster, going at 72 km/h. I need to find out when and where they'll meet.\n\nWait, but how do I approach this? I think it's a relative speed problem. Since both trains are moving in the same direction, the faster one will catch up to the slower one. But wait, no, actually, the problem says they meet each other. Oh, wait, but since they're on the same route, same direction, the faster one catches up. So maybe that's the case here.\n\nSo, first, I should figure out how far ahead Train A is when Train B starts moving. Because Train A has a three-hour head start. So in those three hours, how much distance has Train A covered?\n\nTrain A's speed is 40 km/h. Time is 3 hours (from 11 am to 2 pm). So distance = speed \u00d7 time. 40 * 3 is 120 km. So by 2 pm, Train A is 120 km ahead of Mumbai Central.\n\nNow, from 2 pm onwards, both trains are moving. But wait, Train B is faster. So the relative speed between Train B and Train A would be the difference in their speeds. Because they're moving in the same direction. So relative speed = 72 - 40 = 32 km/h.\n\nSo the distance between them at 2 pm is 120 km. At a relative speed of 32 km/h, how long will it take for Train B to catch up to Train A?\n\nTime = distance / speed. So time = 120 / 32. Let me calculate that. 120 divided by 32 is 3.75 hours. Hmm, 3.75 hours is 3 hours and 45 minutes.\n\nSo from 2 pm, adding 3 hours and 45 minutes. Let's see: 2 pm + 3 hours is 5 pm. Then adding 45 minutes gets us to 5:45 pm.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. 32 km/h for t hours covers 120 km. So 32t = 120 \u2192 t= 120/32 = 3.75 hours. Yes, that's 3h45m.\n\nSo adding that to 2 pm. 2 pm + 3h is 5 pm.

Let me think about the times.\n\nWait, 2 pm is in the same day. Adding 3h45m would take us to 5:45 pm, same day. So none of the options have 5:45 pm.

Correct.\n\nRelative speed: 72-40=32 km/h. Correct.\n\nTime to cover 120 km at 32 km/h: 120/32=3.75 hours=3h45m. Correct.\n\nAdding 3h45m to 2 pm: 2:00 pm + 3h=5 pm. 5 pm +45 min=5:45 pm.

So Train A travels 40*(t+3) km.\n\nThey meet when their distances from Mumbai are equal.

Let me think through this step by step.\n\nTrain A leaves at 11 am going at 40 km/h. Train B leaves later, at 2 pm, but it's faster, going at 72 km/h. Both are on the same route, so they're moving in the same direction. Hmm, I remember that when two objects are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference between their speeds. But wait, since B is faster than A, B is catching up to A, right?\n\nWait, but A has already been moving for some time before B starts. So I should first calculate how far ahead A is when B starts. Let's see, from 11 am to 2 pm is 3 hours. So in those 3 hours, A would have covered some distance. The formula is distance equals speed multiplied by time. So A's distance is 40 km/h * 3 h = 120 km. So when B starts at 2 pm, A is 120 km ahead.\n\nNow, B is moving faster, so the relative speed between them is B's speed minus A's speed. That would be 72 - 40 = 32 km/h. So B is gaining on A at 32 km/h.\n\nThe time it takes for B to catch up to A is the distance between them divided by the relative speed. So time = 120 km / 32 km/h. Let me calculate that. 120 divided by 32 is... 3.75 hours. Hmm, 3.75 hours is 3 hours and 45 minutes.\n\nWait, so B starts at 2 pm. Adding 3 hours and 45 minutes to that. 2 pm plus 3 hours is 5 pm, plus 45 minutes brings it to 5:45 pm. So they meet at 5:45 pm. But wait, the options don't have 5:45 pm.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nLet me double-check. The relative speed is 32 km/h. The head start distance is 120 km. Time is 120/32 = 3.75 hours. So 3.75 hours is 3 hours and 45 minutes. So starting from 2 pm, adding 3 hours brings us to 5 pm, then adding 45 minutes makes it 5:45 pm. So the meeting time is 5:45 pm. None of the options match that exactly. So the correct answer would be E) None of these.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if I messed up the initial calculation. Let me go through it again.\n\nTrain A departs at 11 am, speed 40 km/h. By 2 pm, it's been 3 hours. So distance is 40 *3=120 km. Correct.\n\nRelative speed: 72-40=32 km/h. Correct.\n\nTime to catch up: 120/32 = 3.75 hours. Which is 3h45m. So 2 pm plus 3h45m is 5:45 pm.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 5 pm, which is earlier than 5:45.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about two trains leaving from the same station, Mumbai Central, heading to Lucknow. I need to figure out when they'll meet each other. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the details given: Train A leaves at 11 am, going at 40 kmph. Train B leaves later, at 2 pm, but it's faster, going at 72 kmph. Both are on the same route. So, I guess they'll be on the same track, but since they're moving in the same direction, the faster one will catch up. Wait, but wait, no\u2014because they're both going from Mumbai Central to Lucknow, so they're moving in the same direction. So, Train B is leaving later but faster. So, I think it's a question of how much distance Train A has covered by the time Train B starts, and then figuring out how quickly Train B can catch up.\n\nHmm. Let me think about the time difference first. Train A leaves at 11 am, Train B at 2 pm. So the time between 11 am and 2 pm is 3 hours. So in those 3 hours, Train A is moving towards Lucknow. How far does it go in those 3 hours?\n\nSpeed is 40 kmph, so distance = speed * time. Time is 3 hours. So 40 * 3 = 120 km. So when Train B starts at 2 pm, Train A is already 120 km ahead.\n\nNow, the next thing is to find out when Train B catches up to Train A. Since they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference between their speeds. So, relative speed = 72 kmph (Train B) - 40 kmph (Train A) = 32 kmph. That means every hour, Train B is closing the gap by 32 km.\n\nThe gap to close is 120 km. So the time it takes for Train B to catch up is the distance divided by the relative speed. So 120 / 32. Let me calculate that. 120 divided by 32 is... 3.75 hours. Wait, 32 * 3 is 96, 32 * 3.75 is 32*(3 + 3/4) = 96 + 24 = 120. Yeah, that's right.\n\nSo, 3.75 hours is the same as 3 hours and 45 minutes. Now, when does Train B start? At 2 pm. Adding 3 hours and 45 minutes to 2 pm. Let's see. 2 pm plus 3 hours is 5 pm. Then add 45 minutes, which brings us to 5:45 pm. So, the trains meet at 5:45 pm. Wait, but the options don't have that time. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking at the options: A is 12 am next day, B is 5 am next day, C is 5 pm, D is 2 pm next day, E is none. Oh, wait, 5 pm is option C. But wait, I thought it was 5:45 pm. Hmm, so perhaps none of the options match exactly, so the answer would be E) None of these.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check. So, the distance between them when B starts is 120 km. The relative speed is 32 km/h. Time taken is 120/32 = 3.75 hours, which is 3 hours 45 minutes. So adding 3h45m to 2 pm gives 5:45 pm. So that's 5:45 pm on the same day, right?\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option C which is 5 pm. So perhaps the question expects an approximate answer, but 5:45 pm is not an option. So then, the correct answer would be E) None of these.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any other mistakes. Let's recalculate the initial distance. Train A leaves at 11 am, B at 2 pm. So time difference is 3 hours. At 40 kmph, 3 hours gives 120 km. That's correct. Relative speed is 72-40=32 kmph. Time taken is 120/32 = 3.75 hours, which is 3h45m. So starting at 2 pm, adding 3h45m brings us to 5:45 pm. So the meeting time is 5:45 pm same day.\n\nLooking back at the options, the available options are:\n\nA)12 am next day: that's way too late.\n\nB)5 am next day: that's next morning, which is way after.\n\nC)5 pm on the same day: 5:00 pm is 45 minutes before the correct time.\n\nD)2 pm next day: that's 24 hours later, so also way off.\n\nSo none of the options match the correct time of 5:45 pm, same day. So the correct answer should be E) None of these.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the time calculation. Wait, 2 pm plus 3 hours is 5 pm. Then adding 45 minutes gives 5:45 pm. So, perhaps the options are in half-hour increments, but in this case, it's not one of the options. So E is the correct choice.\n",

But wait, the time here is two hours, right? So, for Train A, the distance covered before 2 pm would be 40 kmph * 2 hours. Let me compute that: 40 * 2 is 80 km. So, when Train B starts at 2 pm, Train A is 80 km ahead on the route.\n\nNow, after 2 pm, both trains are moving towards Lucknow. But since both are going in the same direction, the relative speed between them is the difference in their speeds. Because the faster one (B) is catching up to the slower one (A). So, relative speed would be 72 kmph minus 40 kmph, which is 32 kmph.\n\nSo, the distance between them at 2 pm is 80 km, and the relative speed is 32 kmph. To find the time it takes for B to catch up, I can use the formula time = distance / speed.\n\nSo, time = 80 km / 32 kmph. Let me calculate that. 80 divided by 32 is 2.5 hours. Oh wait, 32 times 2 is 64, and 32 times 2.5 is 80. Yeah, that's right. So, 2.5 hours after 2 pm is when they'll meet.\n\nWhat's 2.5 hours after 2 pm? Let's see, 2 pm plus 2 hours is 4 pm, and then half an hour more would be 4:30 pm. So, they meet at 4:30 pm.\n\nNow, looking at the options, I don't see 4:30 pm as an option. The options are 12 am next day, 5 am, 5 pm, 2 pm next day, or none of these. Hmm. So, none of the options match 4:30 pm. That would mean the correct answer is E) None of these.\n\nWait, but did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, the head start time: from 11 am to 2 pm is three hours, not two. Oh! Wait a second. I think I messed up the time difference. Because from 11 am to 12 pm is one hour, 12 to 1 is another, and 1 to 2 pm is the third. So, that's three hours, not two. Oh no, I made a mistake there.\n\nSo, Train A leaves at 11 am, Train B at 2 pm. So, the time between 11 am and 2 pm is 3 hours. So, A has been traveling for 3 hours before B starts.\n\nSo, distance covered by A in 3 hours is 40 kmph * 3 hours = 120 km. So, at 2 pm, A is 120 km ahead.\n\nThen, relative speed is 72 -40 = 32 kmph. So, time taken for B to catch up is 120 /32 = 3.75 hours. Because 32 * 3 =96, 32 *3.75= 120.\n\n3.75 hours is 3 hours and 45 minutes. So, adding that to 2 pm. 2 pm +3 hours is 5 pm, plus 45 minutes brings it to 5:45 pm.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again, the closest is option C, which is 5 pm. But it's 5:45 pm, which isn't exactly 5 pm. So, the correct meeting time is 5:45 pm, which isn't among the options. So, the answer should be E) None of these.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if I made any other mistakes. Let me redo the calculations.\n\nTime from 11 am to 2 pm: 3 hours.\n\nDistance covered by A: 40 *3=120 km.\n\nRelative speed:72-40=32 kmph.\n\nTime to meet: 120 /32 = 3.75 hours.\n\n3.75 hours is 3 hours and 45 minutes.\n\nSo, adding 3h45m to 2 pm: 2 pm +3h is 5 pm, plus 45 minutes is 5:45 pm.\n\nSo, the meeting time is 5:45 pm, which isn't any of the options A to D. So, the correct answer is E) None of these.\n",

Hmm, let's see.\n\nTrain A leaves at 11 am going at 40 kmph, and Train B leaves three hours later at 2 pm going faster, 72 kmph. So, I guess Train B is catching up to Train A because it's faster. But since they're on the same route, they must meet at some point.\n\nWait, so first, I should figure out how far ahead Train A is when Train B starts moving. Because Train A has a three-hour head start. Since it's moving at 40 kmph, in three hours it would cover 40 * 3 = 120 km. So when Train B starts at 2 pm, Train A is already 120 km ahead.\n\nNow, I need to find out how long it takes for Train B to catch up. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference between their speeds. So 72 kmph minus 40 kmph is 32 kmph. That's how much faster Train B is than A.\n\nThe distance to cover is 120 km, and the relative speed is 32 kmph. So time taken to meet would be distance divided by relative speed. So 120 / 32. Let me calculate that. 120 divided by 32 is the same as 15/4, which is 3.75 hours. Hmm, 3.75 hours is 3 hours and 45 minutes.\n\nSo Train B starts at 2 pm. Adding 3 hours brings it to 5 pm, and then 45 more minutes takes it to 5:45 pm. So they meet at 5:45 pm on the same day?\n\nWait, but looking at the options, the choices are 5 pm, 5 am, etc. So 5 pm is option C. But wait, wait. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, 3.75 hours is 3 hours 45 minutes. So from 2 pm, adding 3 hours brings us to 5 pm, then 45 minutes more is 5:45 pm. So the time is 5:45 pm, which is in the evening. The options don't have 5:45 pm, but option C is 5 pm on the next day? Or same day? Wait, looking back: the options are:\n\nA)12 am next day\n\nB)5 am next day\n\nC)5 pm next day\n\nD)2 pm next day\n\nE)None of these.\n\nWait, so the calculated time is 5:45 pm on the same day, which would be the day they departed. So the options don't have that exact time, but option C is 5 pm next day. Wait, no, no. Wait, maybe I messed up the days.\n\nWait, the departure times are on the same day. So if they meet at 5:45 pm same day, then none of the options A to D match that. Because option C is 5 pm on the next day, which is 24 hours later. So the correct time would be 5:45 pm same day. But that's not an option, so the answer would be E) None of these.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Let me check the problem again. Oh, wait, both trains are leaving from the same station on the same day. So if they meet at 5:45 pm on the same day, which is the same day as their departure. So the options are:\n\nOption C is 5 pm on the next day, which is incorrect. So the correct answer isn't among the options, so E is the answer.\n\nWait, but another approach: perhaps I made a mistake in the time calculation. Let me recalculate the time.\n\nRelative speed is 32 kmph. Distance is 120 km. Time = 120 / 32 = 3.75 hours. So 3 hours and 45 minutes.\n\nSo Train B starts at 2 pm. Adding 3 hours 45 minutes: 2 pm + 3 hours is 5 pm. Plus 45 minutes is 5:45 pm. So same day, not next. So none of the options match, so E is correct.\n",
