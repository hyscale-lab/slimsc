      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about the number of children in a row. Let's see, I'll try to break it down step by step. Hmm, Neha is 12th from the left end, and Radha is 6th from the right end. Then, when Radha is moved two places to the left and Neha two places to the right, there are six children between them. I need to find the total number of children.\n\nWait, let me visualize this. So initially, the row has some number of children. Let's denote the total number as N. Since Radha is 6th from the right, her position from the left would be N - 6 + 1, right? Because if there are N children, the 6th from the right is (N-6+1)th from the left. So Radha's original position is N-5.\n\nSimilarly, Neha is 12th from the left. So her position is 12.\n\nNow, when Radha moves two places to the left, her new position becomes (N-5) - 2 = N-7. And when Neha moves two places to the right, her new position is 12 + 2 = 14.\n\nWait, but in the new positions, there are six children between them. So the distance between Radha and Neha after the shift should be 7 positions because six children in between would mean seven spots apart (since you count the spaces between each child). Let me think. Like, if two people are next to each other, there are zero children between them, so their positions are adjacent. So if there are six children between, the total distance is 6+1=7.\n\nSo the positions after moving: Radha is at N-7, and Neha is at 14. The distance between them is |14 - (N-7)|. But wait, we have to consider the order. Let me see: if Radha is to the left of Neha, then (N-7) would be less than 14. Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. After moving, Radha is shifted two places left, so her position is N-5 - 2 = N-7. Neha is shifted two to the right, so her position is 12 + 2 =14.\n\nNow, the number of children between them is 6. So the distance between them is 6 + 1 =7. So the absolute difference between their new positions is 7.\n\nSo |(N-7) - 14| =7. That's the equation I can set up.\n\nWait, but wait. It's possible that Radha is to the right of Neha, so the distance is 7. So let me write that as |(N-7) -14| =7.\n\nWait, let me compute that.\n\nSo (N-7) -14 = \u00b17.\n\nCase 1: (N-7) -14 =7 \u2192 N-21 =7 \u2192 N=28.\n\nCase 2: (N-7) -14 = -7 \u2192 N-21 =-7 \u2192 N=14.\n\nBut wait, N can't be 14 because Radha is 6th from the right. If N=14, then Radha's original position from the left would be 14-5=9. So she's at position 9. Then, after moving two left, she's at 7. Neha is at 14. But wait, wait, the total number of children is 14, and she's at position 14? That's the end, so moving her two to the right isn't possible because she's already at the end. So that can't be right. So N=14 is invalid.\n\nSo the only valid solution is N=28. Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nIf N=28:\n\nRadha's original position is 28 -5 =23. So she's 23rd from the left, which is 6th from the right (since 28-23+1=6). Correct.\n\nAfter moving two left, Radha is at 23-2=21.\n\nNeha's original position is 12. After moving two right, she's at 14.\n\nNow, the positions are 21 and 14. Wait, but 14 is to the right of 21. So the distance between them is 14 -21 = -7, but absolute is 7. So the number of children between them is 7-1=6? Wait, no. Wait, if the positions are 21 and 14, that can't be because 14 is to the left of 21. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, in a row, higher numbers are to the right. So 21 is to the right of 14. So Radha is at 21, Neha is at 14. So the distance is 21-14=7. So the number of children between them is 7-1=6. Because between 14 and 21, there are 6 children: positions 15,16,17,18,19,20. So yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but wait, 21-14=7 positions apart. So the number of children between them is 7-1=6. So that matches the condition.\n\nSo N=28 is correct. Let me check the options. Option D is 28. So the answer is D.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, when Radha is 6th from the right, her position is N-6 +1 = N-5. So when N=28, Radha is at 23, which is correct. After moving two left, she's at 21. So that's correct.\n\nNeha is at 12, moving two right to 14. So distance is 21-14=7. So six children between. Yes.\n\nSo the answer is 28. So the correct option is D.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about kids standing in a row, and I need to figure out how many are in the row. Let me try to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem says Neha is 12th from the left end. So that means if I count from the left, she's the 12th person. So her position from the left is 12. \n\nThen, Radha is 6th from the right end. Hmm, right end. So if there are, say, N children in total, Radha's position from the left would be N - 6 + 1. Wait, why plus one? Because if someone is 1st from the right in a row of, say, 5, they're 5th from the left. So yes, position from left is total minus position from right plus 1. So Radha's position is N -5.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. If Radha is 6th from the right, her position from the left is (total number of children) - 6 + 1. Because the rightmost is position N, so the 6th from right is N-5. Oh wait, no. Let's take an example. Suppose total is 10. Then 6th from right is 5th from left (because 10-6+1=5). So yes, Radha's position from left is (N - 6 +1) = N-5.\n\nSo before any shifting, Neha is at 12th position from left, Radha is at (N-5)th position from left.\n\nThen, the problem says Radha is shifted to the left by 2 places. So her new position is (N-5) - 2 = N-7. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when you move left, your position number decreases. So if you were at position x, moving left by 2 would take you to x-2. So Radha's new position is (N-5) - 2 = N-7.\n\nSimilarly, Neha is shifted to the right by 2 places. So her new position is 12 + 2 = 14.\n\nNow, after shifting, there are 6 children between Radha and Neha. So the number of children between them is 6. So the distance between them is 6+1 = 7? Wait, no. Because if two people are next to each other, the number of children between them is zero, and the distance is 1. So if the number of children between is 6, the distance between them is 7 positions apart.\n\nSo the absolute difference between their new positions should be 7.\n\nSo Radha's new position is N-7, and Neha's is 14. So the difference is |(N-7) -14| = |N-21|. And this should be equal to 7.\n\nSo |N-21|=7. That gives two possibilities: N-21 =7 or N-21 =-7.\n\nSo N could be 28 or 14.\n\nBut wait, let's think. If N is 14, then Radha's original position was N-5 =14-5=9. So she was at 9th position. After moving left by 2, she's at 7th. Neha was at 12th position, but if N is 14, moving her to the right by 2 would take her to 14th. So the distance between 7 and 14 is 7. So the number of children between them is 14-7-1=6. So that works. So N=14 is a possibility?\n\nWait, but wait, the original positions must make sense. For Radha, being 6th from the right, in N=14, that's 14-6+1=9th from left, which is okay. And Neha is 12th from left in a row of 14, which is possible because 12 <=14. So that works.\n\nBut looking at the options, 14 isn't an option. The options are 23,27,26,28,29. So N can't be 14 because it's not in the options. So the other possibility is N-21=7 \u2192 N=28.\n\nLet me check N=28. So Radha was originally at 28-5=23rd position from left. After moving left by 2, she's at 23-2=21st. Neha was at 12th, after moving right by 2, she's at 14th. So Radha is at 21, Neha at 14. The distance between them is 21-14=7. So the number of children between them is 7-1=6. That fits the condition. So N=28.\n\nBut wait, another thing: when you shift Radha to the left by two, does her position become valid? Like, she can't go beyond the left end. So Radha's original position is N-5. So shifting left by 2 would take her to N-5-2 = N-7. So N-7 must be \u22651, so N\u22658. Which is true in both N=14 and N=28. So no problem there.\n\nSo the possible N's are 28 and 14. Since 14 isn't an option, the answer must be 28. Looking at the options, D is 28.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me see if there's another way this could happen. Because sometimes, when you have two possibilities from absolute value, you have to check if both fit the constraints. Like, in this case, when N=28, Radha is at 21, and Neha at 14. So Radha is to the right of Neha. But wait, because 21 is larger than 14, that would mean Radha is to the right. So the distance between them is 7, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, when N=14, Radha is at 7, and Neha at 14. So Radha is at 7, which is left of 14. So the distance is 14-7=7, same as before. So both scenarios are correct, but N=14 isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the shifting direction. Let me think again: when you shift left, you decrease your position number. So Radha moving left by 2: from (N-5) to (N-5)-2 = N-7. So her new position is N-7.\n\nNeha moving right by 2: from 12 to 14.\n\nThe number of children between them is 6. So the positions are either:\n\nRadha is at N-7, and Neha at 14, and the distance is |(N-7) -14|=7.\n\nSo N-7 -14 =7 \u2192 N=28.\n\nOr, 14 - (N-7) =7 \u2192 14 -N +7 =7 \u2192 21 -N =7 \u2192 N=14.\n\nSo both are possible, but N=14 isn't an option. So the answer must be 28. Which is option D.\n",

Wait, why plus one? Because if someone is 1st from the right in a row of, say, 5, they're 5th from the left. So yes, position from left is total minus position from right plus 1. So Radha's position is N -5.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. If Radha is 6th from the right, her position from the left is (total number of children) - 6 + 1. Because the rightmost is position N, so the 6th from right is N-5. Oh wait, no. Let's take an example. Suppose total is 10. Then 6th from right is 5th from left (because 10-6+1=5). So yes, Radha's position from left is (N - 6 +1) = N-5.\n\nSo before any shifting, Neha is at 12th position from left, Radha is at (N-5)th position from left.\n\nThen, the problem says Radha is shifted to the left by 2 places.

Wait, no. Because if two people are next to each other, the number of children between them is zero, and the distance is 1. So if the number of children between is 6, the distance between them is 7 positions apart.\n\nSo the absolute difference between their new positions should be 7.\n\nSo Radha's new position is N-7, and Neha's is 14. So the difference is |(N-7) -14| = |N-21|. And this should be equal to 7.\n\nSo |N-21|=7. That gives two possibilities: N-21 =7 or N-21 =-7.\n\nSo N could be 28 or 14.\n\nBut wait, let's think. If N is 14, then Radha's original position was N-5 =14-5=9. So she was at 9th position. After moving left by 2, she's at 7th. Neha was at 12th position, but if N is 14, moving her to the right by 2 would take her to 14th. So the distance between 7 and 14 is 7. So the number of children between them is 14-7-1=6. So that works. So N=14 is a possibility?\n\nWait, but wait, the original positions must make sense. For Radha, being 6th from the right, in N=14, that's 14-6+1=9th from left, which is okay. And Neha is 12th from left in a row of 14, which is possible because 12 <=14. So that works.\n\nBut looking at the options, 14 isn't an option. The options are 23,27,26,28,29. So N can't be 14 because it's not in the options. So the other possibility is N-21=7 \u2192 N=28.\n\nLet me check N=28. So Radha was originally at 28-5=23rd position from left. After moving left by 2, she's at 23-2=21st. Neha was at 12th, after moving right by 2, she's at 14th. So Radha is at 21, Neha at 14. The distance between them is 21-14=7. So the number of children between them is 7-1=6. That fits the condition. So N=28.\n\nBut wait, another thing: when you shift Radha to the left by two, does her position become valid? Like, she can't go beyond the left end. So Radha's original position is N-5. So shifting left by 2 would take her to N-5-2 = N-7. So N-7 must be \u22651, so N\u22658. Which is true in both N=14 and N=28. So no problem there.\n\nSo the possible N's are 28 and 14. Since 14 isn't an option, the answer must be 28. Looking at the options, D is 28.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me see if there's another way this could happen. Because sometimes, when you have two possibilities from absolute value, you have to check if both fit the constraints. Like, in this case, when N=28, Radha is at 21, and Neha at 14. So Radha is to the right of Neha. But wait, because 21 is larger than 14, that would mean Radha is to the right. So the distance between them is 7, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, when N=14, Radha is at 7, and Neha at 14. So Radha is at 7, which is left of 14. So the distance is 14-7=7, same as before. So both scenarios are correct, but N=14 isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the shifting direction. Let me think again: when you shift left, you decrease your position number. So Radha moving left by 2: from (N-5) to (N-5)-2 = N-7. So her new position is N-7.\n\nNeha moving right by 2: from 12 to 14.\n\nThe number of children between them is 6. So the positions are either:\n\nRadha is at N-7, and Neha at 14, and the distance is |(N-7) -14|=7.\n\nSo N-7 -14 =7 \u2192 N=28.\n\nOr, 14 - (N-7) =7 \u2192 14 -N +7 =7 \u2192 21 -N =7 \u2192 N=14.\n\nSo both are possible, but N=14 isn't an option. So the answer must be 28. Which is option D.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by analyzing the positions of Neha and Radha in the row. Initially, Neha is 12th from the left end, and Radha is 6th from the right end. If the total number of children is \\( N \\), Radha's position from the left is \\( N - 6 + 1 = N - 5 \\).\n\nAfter shifting, Radha moves 2 places to the left, so her new position becomes \\( (N - 5) - 2 = N - 7 \\). Similarly, Neha moves 2 places to the right, so her new position becomes \\( 12 + 2 = 14 \\). The problem states that there are 6 children between Radha and Neha after the shift. This means the distance between them is \\( 6 + 1 = 7 \\).\n\nThe absolute difference between their new positions must be 7:\n\\[\n|(N - 7) - 14| = 7\n\\]\nThis gives two possible equations:\n1. \\( (N - 7) - 14 = 7 \\)  \n   Solving: \\( N - 21 = 7 \\)  \n   \\( N = 28 \\)\n\n2. \\( 14 - (N - 7) = 7 \\)  \n   Solving: \\( 21 - N = 7 \\)  \n   \\( N = 14 \\)\n\nSince \\( N = 14 \\) is not among the given options, the valid solution is \\( N = 28 \\). To verify, if \\( N = 28 \\), Radha's original position is \\( 28 - 5 = 23 \\), and after shifting left by 2, she is at position \\( 21 \\). Neha's position after shifting right by 2 is \\( 14 \\). The distance between \\( 21 \\) and \\( 14 \\) is \\( 7 \\), which matches the condition of 6 children between them.\n\nThus, the total number of children in the row is \\( 28 \\).\n\nAnswer: D",

Then, Radha is moved two places to the left, and Neha is moved two places to the right. After that, there are 6 children between them. We need to find the total number of children in the row.\n\nHmm, I think I should start by visualizing their positions before any shifts. Let's denote the total number of children as N.\n\nNeha's position is 12th from the left. So, her position is 12. Radha is 6th from the right, which means her position is N - 6 + 1. Wait, because if you're counting positions from the end, the formula is position = total - end_position + 1. So Radha is at position N -6 +1 = N-5.\n\nWait, maybe I should write it down. Let me think: if there are N children in a row, and Radha is 6th from the right, her position is (N -6 +1) because the first from the right is N, the second is N-1, etc. So Radha is at position N -5.\n\nNow, after shifting, Radha moves 2 places to the left. So her new position is (N-5) - 2 = N -7. Similarly, Neha moves 2 places to the right, so her new position is 12 + 2 = 14.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Wait a minute. When Radha moves to the left by 2 places, does that mean her new position is her old position minus 2? And similarly, moving to the right by 2 would be adding 2 to her position? Yes, that's correct. Because moving left decreases the position number (since the left end is lower position numbers), and moving right increases them.\n\nNow, after the shift, the number of children between them is 6. So the distance between Radha and Neha is 6+1=7 children? Because if there are 6 children between them, they are separated by 7 positions. Wait, no. Let me think again. If two people are k positions apart, the number of children between them is (k-1). So if the positions are p and q, the number of children between them is |p - q| -1. So in this case, the number of children between them after shifting is 6, so the distance between them is 7.\n\nSo after shifting, the positions are Radha at N-7 and Neha at 14. The distance between them is | (14) - (N-7) | = |21 - N|. Because 14 is a position on the left, and N-7 is the position on the right, assuming N is larger than 21. So the distance is (N-7 -14) = N -21. But wait, that's only if N-7 is to the right of 14.\n\nWait, no. Let's think about their positions. After shifting, Radha is at N-7, which is a position from the left. So if N-7 is less than 14, then Radha is to the left of Neha. Otherwise, she's to the right.\n\nWait, let's imagine that. Suppose N is such that N-7 is less than 14. So Radha is to the left of Neha. Then the distance between them is (14 - (N-7)) = 21 - N. But since the number of children between them is 6, the distance (positions apart) is 7. So |14 - (N-7)| = 7.\n\nWait, so |14 - (N-7)| = 7. Let me compute that:\n\n14 - (N -7) = 7 \u2192 14 - N +7 =7 \u2192 21 - N =7 \u2192 N=14. But that can't be, because Radha's original position was N-5. If N=14, Radha was at 14-5=9. Then, after moving left by 2, she's at 7. But that's a possible scenario, but let's check the other possibility.\n\nAlternatively, if (N-7) -14 =7 \u2192 N-7 -14=7 \u2192 N=28.\n\nSo N could be 14 or 28. But wait, N=14 would make the original position of Radha at 9, and after shifting to 7. Then, the distance between Radha (7) and Neha (14) would be 14-7=7, which would mean 6 children in between. So that works.\n\nBut wait, let's check if N=14 is possible. Because originally, Radha was 6th from the right, which is position 14-5=9. So in a row of 14 children, she's at 9. Then, moving left by 2 to position 7, and Neha is at 14. So the distance is 14-7=7, which is correct. So 6 children in between. So that's a valid scenario. But let me check the options. The options are A)23, B)27, C)26, D)28, E)29.\n\nWait, 14 is not among the options. So perhaps my initial approach is wrong. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of children between them is 6, which implies the positions are 7 apart. So |position of Radha - position of Neha| =7.\n\nSo after shifting, Radha is at N-7, and Neha is at 14. So |(N-7) -14|=7.\n\nWhich gives two possibilities:\n\nN-7 -14 =7 \u2192 N-21=7 \u2192 N=28.\n\nOr 14 - (N-7) =7 \u2192 21 - N=7 \u2192 N=14.\n\nSo N can be 14 or 28. But as I said, N=14 is an option not present in the given options except for D)28. So perhaps 28 is the answer.\n\nWait, but let's check for N=28.\n\nOriginal positions: Neha is 12th from left, Radha is 6th from right, which is 28-6+1=23rd position.\n\nAfter shifting: Radha moves left by 2 \u2192 23-2=21. Neha moves right by 2 \u219212+2=14.\n\nSo Radha is at 21, Neha at 14. So the distance between them is 21-14=7. Number of children between them is 7-1=6. That matches the condition.\n\nSo N=28 is correct. So the answer is D)28.\n",

Because moving left decreases the position number (since the left end is lower position numbers), and moving right increases them.\n\nNow, after the shift, the number of children between them is 6. So the distance between Radha and Neha is 6+1=7 children? Because if there are 6 children between them, they are separated by 7 positions. Wait, no. Let me think again. If two people are k positions apart, the number of children between them is (k-1). So if the positions are p and q, the number of children between them is |p - q| -1. So in this case, the number of children between them after shifting is 6, so the distance between them is 7.\n\nSo after shifting, the positions are Radha at N-7 and Neha at 14. The distance between them is | (14) - (N-7) | = |21 - N|. Because 14 is a position on the left, and N-7 is the position on the right, assuming N is larger than 21.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and think through step by step.\n\nThe problem is about children standing in a row. Neha is 12th from the left end, and Radha is 6th from the right end. Then, Radha is shifted two places to the left, and Neha is shifted two places to the right. After this shift, there are six children between Radha and Neha. I need to find out how many children are in the row.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. I think I should start by visualizing the initial positions.\n\nFirst, let me assign positions. Let's say the row has N children. So, positions are from 1 (left end) to N (right end).\n\nNeha is 12th from the left. So her initial position is 12.\n\nRadha is 6th from the right end. Since the right end is position N, Radha's initial position is N - 6 + 1. Wait, because if she's 6th from the right, her position is N-5. For example, if there are 10 children, 6th from the right is position 5 (10-6+1=5).\n\nWait, let me clarify: the formula for position from the right is N - (k-1), where k is the position from the right. So yes, Radha is at position N-5.\n\nNow, after shifting, Radha moves two places to the left. So her new position is (N-5) - 2 = N-7.\n\nNeha moves two places to the right. Her new position is 12 + 2 = 14.\n\nNow, after shifting, there are six children between Radha and Neha. So the number of children between them is 6, which means the distance between their positions is 6+1=7 positions apart. Because if two people are 6 apart in between, the positions are 7 apart. Like positions 3 and 10 have 6 children in between (4,5,6,7,8,9).\n\nSo, the absolute difference between Radha's new position and Neha's new position should be 7.\n\nSo, | (N-7) - 14 | = 7.\n\nWait, but depending on who is to the left, the positions could be either way. Let's think: after shifting, Radha is moving left, which would decrease her position. Neha is moving right, increasing her position. So, Radha's new position is N-7, and Neha's is 14. So, the positions after shifting could be:\n\nCase 1: Radha is to the left of Neha. So, N-7 < 14. The distance is 14 - (N-7) = 7.\n\nCase 2: Radha is to the right of Neha. Then, (N-7) - 14 =7.\n\nLet me write the equations for both cases.\n\nCase 1: 14 - (N-7) =7 \u2192 14 - N +7 =7 \u2192 21 - N =7 \u2192 N=14.\n\nWait, but if N is 14, let's check the initial positions. Radha is 6th from the right, so her initial position is 14-5=9. So she's at 9. After shifting two left, she's at 7. Neha is at 12, shifting two right to 14. So Radha is at 7, Neha at 14. Number of children between them is 14-7-1=6. Oh, wait, that's exactly the condition. So N=14 would satisfy this.\n\nBut wait, wait a minute. The initial position of Radha is 6th from the right, which would be 9 in a 14-child row. But wait, in that case, her new position is 7. And the total number of children is 14. But wait, can the number of children be 14? Let's check the options given. The options are 23, 27, 26, 28, 29. So 14 isn't even an option. So maybe this case is not possible. Maybe I made a mistake in the case assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the positions correctly. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial positions are such that after shifting, the positions are as I said, and the distance is 7. But maybe N isn't 14. Let's try the other case.\n\nCase 2: (N-7) -14 =7 \u2192 N-7 =21 \u2192 N=28.\n\nWait, so N=28. Let's check this.\n\nInitial positions:\n\nNeha is at 12, Radha is at 28-5=23.\n\nAfter shifting:\n\nRadha moves 2 left: 23-2=21.\n\nNeha moves 2 right:12+2=14.\n\nWait, so Radha is at 21, Neha at 14. Wait, but 21 is to the right of 14. So Radha is at 21, which is to the right of 14. So the distance between them is 21-14=7, which would mean 6 children in between. That fits the condition.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. If Radha is at 21 and Neha at 14, then Radha is to the right of Neha. So the positions are 14 and 21. The number of children between them would be positions 15,16,17,18,19,20: that's six children. So yes, this works.\n\nSo N=28 is a possibility.\n\nWait, but in Case 1, N=14, which is not an option, but perhaps I should check whether N=14 is even possible. Let's see.\n\nIn N=14, Radha is at position 9, shifts to 7. Neha is at 12, shifts to 14. So the positions are 7 and 14. Number of children between is 14-7-1=6. That's correct. So N=14 is a possible solution, but it's not in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe I should model the positions more accurately.\n\nLet me model the initial positions:\n\n- Let total children be N.\n\nNeha's initial position: 12 (from left).\n\nRadha's initial position: N-5 (since 6th from right end: N -6 +1 = N-5).\n\nAfter shifting:\n\nRadha moves 2 to the left: new position is (N-5) -2 = N-7.\n\nNeha moves 2 to the right: new position is 12 +2 =14.\n\nNow, the distance between Radha and Neha after shifting is 7 (since 6 children in between \u2192 7 positions apart).\n\nSo the absolute difference between their new positions is 7.\n\nSo | (N-7) -14 | =7.\n\nWhich gives two possibilities:\n\n1. (N-7) -14 =7 \u2192 N-21=7 \u2192 N=28.\n\n2. 14 - (N-7) =7 \u2192 21 -N=7 \u2192 N=14.\n\nSo N can be 28 or 14.\n\nBut in the options, 28 is option D, and 14 isn't an option. So perhaps N=28 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but why is N=14 not an option? Let's see if N=14 is a valid possibility.\n\nWait, in N=14, Radha's initial position is 14-5=9. After shifting two left, she's at 7. Neha is at 12, shifting to 14. So positions 7 and 14. The number of children between is 14-7-1=6. That's correct.\n\nBut the options don't have 14, so perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if the shifting of positions is possible in N=14. Like, can Radha move two places to the left? If she's at position 9, moving two left would take her to 7, which is fine. Similarly, Neha is at 12, moving two right to 14, which is the end. So that's possible.\n\nBut the problem says that after shifting, there are 6 children between them. So both N=14 and N=28 fit the condition.\n\nBut since the options don't have 14, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial positions are such that when shifted, the positions might not allow for the correct distance. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the equation should consider the direction of movement. Let me think about it again.\n\nWait, if after shifting, Radha is to the left of Neha, then:\n\nRadha's new position (N-7) should be less than Neha's new position (14). So N-7 <14 \u2192 N<21.\n\nIn this case, the distance is 14 - (N-7) =7 \u2192 21 - N =7 \u2192 N=14.\n\nIf Radha is to the right of Neha after shifting, then N-7 >14 \u2192 N>21. Then, the distance is (N-7) -14 =7 \u2192 N=28.\n\nSo both N=14 and N=28 are possible, but only 28 is in the options. So perhaps the correct answer is 28.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me imagine N=28.\n\nInitial positions:\n\nNeha is at 12, Radha at 23 (since 28-5=23).\n\nAfter shifting:\n\nRadha at 21 (23-2=21), Neha at 14 (12+2=14).\n\nSo Radha is at 21, which is to the right of 14. So the distance between them is 21-14=7. That's correct.\n\nSo there are 7 positions between them, which means 6 children in between. So that fits.\n\nSo N=28 is correct.\n\nBut then, why is N=14 not an option? Because the options start from 23. So perhaps the problem has constraints that I'm missing.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the initial positions are such that when shifted, the new positions are possible. Like, for N=14, Radha is at 7, which is valid, and Neha is at 14, which is valid.\n\nSo why isn't 14 an option? Maybe I made a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nWait, let me recheck the problem. It says \"there are 6 children between Radha and Neha.\" So the positions after shifting should have 6 children between them, which is a distance of 7.\n\nBut maybe I should consider that the direction of the shift could affect the outcome. Wait, in N=14, Radha's new position is 7, which is left of Neha's new position (14). So the number of children between them is 14-7-1=6, which is correct.\n\nSo N=14 is a valid solution, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the initial position of Radha. Let me recheck. Radha is 6th from the right end. So in a row of N, her position is N -6 +1 = N-5. So for N=14, that's 14-5=9. Correct.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, when you shift someone, you have to make sure that the new positions are valid. For example, Radha cannot shift left beyond the first position, and Neha cannot shift right beyond the last position.\n\nIn N=14, after shifting, Radha is at 7, which is valid. And Neha is at 14, which is the end. So that's valid.\n\nSo why isn't 14 an option? The options are 23,27,26,28,29.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of children between them is 6, which makes the distance 7. So the absolute difference between their positions is 7.\n\nSo the equation is | (N-7) -14 | =7.\n\nWhich leads to N=28 or N=14.\n\nBut since 28 is an option, and 14 isn't, perhaps the correct answer is 28.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the total number of children to be more than the maximum initial position.\n\nWait, in N=14, the initial positions are 12 and 9, which are within 14. So that's fine.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects that after shifting, the positions are still valid. For example, Radha is at N-7, which for N=14 would be 7. That's valid.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused because both N=14 and N=28 satisfy the condition. But since only 28 is an option, perhaps that's the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I missed something in the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nQuestion: In a row of children, Neha is 12th from left end and Radha is 6th from right end. When Radha is shifted to left by 2 places and Neha is shifted to right by 2 places, there are 6 children between Radha and Neha. How many children are there in the row?\n\nSo, the initial positions are 12 and N-5.\n\nAfter shifting: Radha is at N-7, Neha is at 14.\n\nThe distance between them is 7, so |(N-7) -14|=7 \u2192 N=28 or N=14.\n\nBut since 28 is an option, perhaps that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me think about the shifting again. If N=14, then Radha is at 23 (N=28, 28-5=23). Wait, no, that's when N=28. Wait, no, in N=14, Radha's initial position is 9, after shifting to left by 2, she's at 7. So, when N=14, after shifting, she's at 7, and Neha is at 14. So, positions 7 and 14, with 6 children in between. That's correct.\n\nBut since the options don't include 14, perhaps the correct answer is 28.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that in N=14, the total number of children is 14, but the shifts would make Radha at 7 and Neha at 14, which are valid positions. So why is 14 not an option?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me denote the initial positions as Pn and Pr for Neha and Radha, respectively.\n\nPn =12.\n\nPr = N -6 +1= N-5.\n\nAfter shifting, Pn' =12 +2 =14.\n\nPr' = (N-5) -2 = N-7.\n\nThe distance between them is |14 - (N-7)| =7.\n\nSo, |21 - N|=7 \u2192 21 - N=7 \u2192 N=14, or 21 -N= -7 \u2192 N=28.\n\nSo both N=14 and N=28 are possible.\n\nBut since the options don't include 14, perhaps N=28 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects the total number of children to be such that when you shift, Radha is to the left of Neha. Because in N=14, Radha is to the left of Neha after shifting, but in N=28, she's to the right.\n\nWait, the problem statement doesn't specify the relative positions after shifting, just that there are six children between them. So both possibilities are valid, but only N=28 is in the options.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is 28, option D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves determining the total number of children in a row based on their initial and shifted positions. Here's the analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Positions**:\n   - Neha is 12th from the left end, so her initial position is **12**.\n   - Radha is 6th from the right end. In a row of \\( N \\) children, her initial position is \\( N - 5 \\) (since the \\( k \\)-th position from the right is \\( N - (k - 1) \\)).\n\n2. **After Shifting**:\n   - Radha is shifted 2 places to the left, so her new position is \\( (N - 5) - 2 = N - 7 \\).\n   - Neha is shifted 2 places to the right, so her new position is \\( 12 + 2 = 14 \\).\n\n3. **Distance Between Positions**:\n   - After shifting, there are 6 children between Radha and Neha. This means the distance between their positions is \\( 6 + 1 = 7 \\).\n   - The absolute difference between their new positions is \\( |(N - 7) - 14| = 7 \\).\n\n4. **Solving for \\( N \\)**:\n   - Expanding the equation:\n     \\[\n     |(N - 7) - 14| = 7 \\implies |N - 21| = 7\n     \\]\n   - This gives two possible solutions:\n     \\[\n     N - 21 = 7 \\implies N = 28 \\quad \\text{(Case 1)}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     -(N - 21) = 7 \\implies N = 14 \\quad \\text{(Case 2)}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Validation**:\n   - For \\( N = 28 \\):\n     - Radha's initial position is \\( 28 - 5 = 23 \\), and after shifting, her new position is \\( 23 - 2 = 21 \\).\n     - Neha's new position is \\( 12 + 2 = 14 \\).\n     - The distance between \\( 21 \\) and \\( 14 \\) is \\( 21 - 14 = 7 \\), which satisfies the condition of 6 children between them.\n   - For \\( N = 14 \\):\n     - Radha's initial position is \\( 14 - 5 = 9 \\), and after shifting, her new position is \\( 9 - 2 = 7 \\).\n     - Neha's new position is \\( 12 + 2 = 14 \\).\n     - The distance between \\( 7 \\) and \\( 14 \\) is \\( 14 - 7 = 7 \\), which also satisfies the condition.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Both \\( N = 28 \\) and \\( N = 14 \\) satisfy the problem's conditions. However, since \\( 14 \\) is not an option, the correct answer must be \\( N = 28 \\).\n\n**Answer: D**",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and think through step by step.\n\nThe problem is about children standing in a row. Neha is 12th from the left end, and Radha is 6th from the right end. Then, Radha is shifted two places to the left, and Neha is shifted two places to the right. After this shift, there are six children between Radha and Neha. I need to find out how many children are in the row.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. I think I should start by visualizing the initial positions.\n\nFirst, let me assign positions. Let's say the row has N children. So, positions are from 1 (left end) to N (right end).\n\nNeha is 12th from the left. So her initial position is 12.\n\nRadha is 6th from the right end. Since the right end is position N, Radha's initial position is N - 6 + 1. Wait, because if she's 6th from the right, her position is N-5. For example, if there are 10 children, 6th from the right is position 5 (10-6+1=5).\n\nWait, let me clarify: the formula for position from the right is N - (k-1), where k is the position from the right. So yes, Radha is at position N-5.\n\nNow, after shifting, Radha moves two places to the left. So her new position is (N-5) - 2 = N-7.\n\nNeha moves two places to the right. Her new position is 12 + 2 = 14.\n\nNow, after shifting, there are six children between Radha and Neha. So the number of children between them is 6, which means the distance between their positions is 6+1=7 positions apart. Because if two people are 6 apart in between, the positions are 7 apart. Like positions 3 and 10 have 6 children in between (4,5,6,7,8,9).\n\nSo, the absolute difference between Radha's new position and Neha's new position should be 7.\n\nSo, | (N-7) - 14 | = 7.\n\nWait, but depending on who is to the left, the positions could be either way. Let's think: after shifting, Radha is moving left, which would decrease her position. Neha is moving right, increasing her position. So, Radha's new position is N-7, and Neha's is 14. So, the positions after shifting could be:\n\nCase 1: Radha is to the left of Neha. So, N-7 < 14. The distance is 14 - (N-7) = 7.\n\nCase 2: Radha is to the right of Neha. Then, (N-7) - 14 =7.\n\nLet me write the equations for both cases.\n\nCase 1: 14 - (N-7) =7 \u2192 14 - N +7 =7 \u2192 21 - N =7 \u2192 N=14.\n\nWait, but if N is 14, let's check the initial positions. Radha is 6th from the right, so her initial position is 14-5=9. So she's at 9. After shifting two left, she's at 7. Neha is at 12, shifting two right to 14. So Radha is at 7, Neha at 14. Number of children between them is 14-7-1=6. Oh, wait, that's exactly the condition. So N=14 would satisfy this.\n\nBut wait, wait a minute. The initial position of Radha is 6th from the right, which would be 9 in a 14-child row. But wait, in that case, her new position is 7. And the total number of children is 14. But wait, can the number of children be 14? Let's check the options given. The options are 23, 27, 26, 28, 29. So 14 isn't even an option. So maybe this case is not possible. Maybe I made a mistake in the case assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the positions correctly. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial positions are such that after shifting, the positions are as I said, and the distance is 7. But maybe N isn't 14. Let's try the other case.\n\nCase 2: (N-7) -14 =7 \u2192 N-7 =21 \u2192 N=28.\n\nWait, so N=28. Let's check this.\n\nInitial positions:\n\nNeha is at 12, Radha is at 28-5=23.\n\nAfter shifting:\n\nRadha moves 2 left: 23-2=21.\n\nNeha moves 2 right:12+2=14.\n\nWait, so Radha is at 21, Neha at 14. Wait, but 21 is to the right of 14. So Radha is at 21, which is to the right of 14. So the distance between them is 21-14=7, which would mean 6 children in between. That fits the condition.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. If Radha is at 21 and Neha at 14, then Radha is to the right of Neha. So the positions are 14 and 21. The number of children between them would be positions 15,16,17,18,19,20: that's six children. So yes, this works.\n\nSo N=28 is a possibility.\n\nWait, but in Case 1, N=14, which is not an option, but perhaps I should check whether N=14 is even possible. Let's see.\n\nIn N=14, Radha is at position 9, shifts to 7. Neha is at 12, shifts to 14. So the positions are 7 and 14. Number of children between is 14-7-1=6. That's correct. So N=14 is a possible solution, but it's not in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe I should model the positions more accurately.\n\nLet me model the initial positions:\n\n- Let total children be N.\n\nNeha's initial position: 12 (from left).\n\nRadha's initial position: N-5 (since 6th from right end: N -6 +1 = N-5).\n\nAfter shifting:\n\nRadha moves 2 to the left: new position is (N-5) -2 = N-7.\n\nNeha moves 2 to the right: new position is 12 +2 =14.\n\nNow, the distance between Radha and Neha after shifting is 7 (since 6 children in between \u2192 7 positions apart).\n\nSo the absolute difference between their new positions is 7.\n\nSo | (N-7) -14 | =7.\n\nWhich gives two possibilities:\n\n1. (N-7) -14 =7 \u2192 N-21=7 \u2192 N=28.\n\n2. 14 - (N-7) =7 \u2192 21 -N=7 \u2192 N=14.\n\nSo N can be 28 or 14.\n\nBut in the options, 28 is option D, and 14 isn't an option. So perhaps N=28 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but why is N=14 not an option? Let's see if N=14 is a valid possibility.\n\nWait, in N=14, Radha's initial position is 14-5=9. After shifting two left, she's at 7. Neha is at 12, shifting to 14. So positions 7 and 14. The number of children between is 14-7-1=6. That's correct.\n\nBut the options don't have 14, so perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if the shifting of positions is possible in N=14. Like, can Radha move two places to the left? If she's at position 9, moving two left would take her to 7, which is fine. Similarly, Neha is at 12, moving two right to 14, which is the end. So that's possible.\n\nBut the problem says that after shifting, there are 6 children between them. So both N=14 and N=28 fit the condition.\n\nBut since the options don't have 14, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial positions are such that when shifted, the positions might not allow for the correct distance. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the equation should consider the direction of movement. Let me think about it again.\n\nWait, if after shifting, Radha is to the left of Neha, then:\n\nRadha's new position (N-7) should be less than Neha's new position (14). So N-7 <14 \u2192 N<21.\n\nIn this case, the distance is 14 - (N-7) =7 \u2192 21 - N =7 \u2192 N=14.\n\nIf Radha is to the right of Neha after shifting, then N-7 >14 \u2192 N>21. Then, the distance is (N-7) -14 =7 \u2192 N=28.\n\nSo both N=14 and N=28 are possible, but only 28 is in the options. So perhaps the correct answer is 28.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me imagine N=28.\n\nInitial positions:\n\nNeha is at 12, Radha at 23 (since 28-5=23).\n\nAfter shifting:\n\nRadha at 21 (23-2=21), Neha at 14 (12+2=14).\n\nSo Radha is at 21, which is to the right of 14. So the distance between them is 21-14=7. That's correct.\n\nSo there are 7 positions between them, which means 6 children in between. So that fits.\n\nSo N=28 is correct.\n\nBut then, why is N=14 not an option? Because the options start from 23. So perhaps the problem has constraints that I'm missing.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the initial positions are such that when shifted, the new positions are possible. Like, for N=14, Radha is at 7, which is valid, and Neha is at 14, which is valid.\n\nSo why isn't 14 an option? Maybe I made a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nWait, let me recheck the problem. It says \"there are 6 children between Radha and Neha.\" So the positions after shifting should have 6 children between them, which is a distance of 7.\n\nBut maybe I should consider that the direction of the shift could affect the outcome. Wait, in N=14, Radha's new position is 7, which is left of Neha's new position (14). So the number of children between them is 14-7-1=6, which is correct.\n\nSo N=14 is a valid solution, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the initial position of Radha. Let me recheck. Radha is 6th from the right end. So in a row of N, her position is N -6 +1 = N-5. So for N=14, that's 14-5=9. Correct.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, when you shift someone, you have to make sure that the new positions are valid. For example, Radha cannot shift left beyond the first position, and Neha cannot shift right beyond the last position.\n\nIn N=14, after shifting, Radha is at 7, which is valid. And Neha is at 14, which is the end. So that's valid.\n\nSo why isn't 14 an option? The options are 23,27,26,28,29.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of children between them is 6, which makes the distance 7. So the absolute difference between their positions is 7.\n\nSo the equation is | (N-7) -14 | =7.\n\nWhich leads to N=28 or N=14.\n\nBut since 28 is an option, and 14 isn't, perhaps the correct answer is 28.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the total number of children to be more than the maximum initial position.\n\nWait, in N=14, the initial positions are 12 and 9, which are within 14. So that's fine.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects that after shifting, the positions are still valid. For example, Radha is at N-7, which for N=14 would be 7. That's valid.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused because both N=14 and N=28 satisfy the condition. But since only 28 is an option, perhaps that's the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I missed something in the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nQuestion: In a row of children, Neha is 12th from left end and Radha is 6th from right end. When Radha is shifted to left by 2 places and Neha is shifted to right by 2 places, there are 6 children between Radha and Neha. How many children are there in the row?\n\nSo, the initial positions are 12 and N-5.\n\nAfter shifting: Radha is at N-7, Neha is at 14.\n\nThe distance between them is 7, so |(N-7) -14|=7 \u2192 N=28 or N=14.\n\nBut since 28 is an option, perhaps that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me think about the shifting again. If N=14, then Radha is at 23 (N=28, 28-5=23). Wait, no, that's when N=28. Wait, no, in N=14, Radha's initial position is 9, after shifting to left by 2, she's at 7. So, when N=14, after shifting, she's at 7, and Neha is at 14. So, positions 7 and 14, with 6 children in between. That's correct.\n\nBut since the options don't include 14, perhaps the correct answer is 28.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that in N=14, the total number of children is 14, but the shifts would make Radha at 7 and Neha at 14, which are valid positions. So why is 14 not an option?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me denote the initial positions as Pn and Pr for Neha and Radha, respectively.\n\nPn =12.\n\nPr = N -6 +1= N-5.\n\nAfter shifting, Pn' =12 +2 =14.\n\nPr' = (N-5) -2 = N-7.\n\nThe distance between them is |14 - (N-7)| =7.\n\nSo, |21 - N|=7 \u2192 21 - N=7 \u2192 N=14, or 21 -N= -7 \u2192 N=28.\n\nSo both N=14 and N=28 are possible.\n\nBut since the options don't include 14, perhaps N=28 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects the total number of children to be such that when you shift, Radha is to the left of Neha. Because in N=14, Radha is to the left of Neha after shifting, but in N=28, she's to the right.\n\nWait, the problem statement doesn't specify the relative positions after shifting, just that there are six children between them. So both possibilities are valid, but only N=28 is in the options.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is 28, option D.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the total number of children in a row based on their initial and shifted positions. Here's the analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Positions**:\n   - Neha is 12th from the left end, so her initial position is **12**.\n   - Radha is 6th from the right end. In a row of \\( N \\) children, her initial position is \\( N - 5 \\) (since the \\( k \\)-th position from the right is \\( N - (k - 1) \\)).\n\n2. **After Shifting**:\n   - Radha is shifted 2 places to the left, so her new position is \\( (N - 5) - 2 = N - 7 \\).\n   - Neha is shifted 2 places to the right, so her new position is \\( 12 + 2 = 14 \\).\n\n3. **Distance Between Positions**:\n   - After shifting, there are 6 children between Radha and Neha. This means the distance between their positions is \\( 6 + 1 = 7 \\).\n   - The absolute difference between their new positions is \\( |(N - 7) - 14| = 7 \\).\n\n4. **Solving for \\( N \\)**:\n   - Expanding the equation:\n     \\[\n     |(N - 7) - 14| = 7 \\implies |N - 21| = 7\n     \\]\n   - This gives two possible solutions:\n     \\[\n     N - 21 = 7 \\implies N = 28 \\quad \\text{(Case 1)}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     -(N - 21) = 7 \\implies N = 14 \\quad \\text{(Case 2)}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Validation**:\n   - For \\( N = 28 \\):\n     - Radha's initial position is \\( 28 - 5 = 23 \\), and after shifting, her new position is \\( 23 - 2 = 21 \\).\n     - Neha's new position is \\( 12 + 2 = 14 \\).\n     - The distance between \\( 21 \\) and \\( 14 \\) is \\( 21 - 14 = 7 \\), which satisfies the condition of 6 children between them.\n   - For \\( N = 14 \\):\n     - Radha's initial position is \\( 14 - 5 = 9 \\), and after shifting, her new position is \\( 9 - 2 = 7 \\).\n     - Neha's new position is \\( 12 + 2 = 14 \\).\n     - The distance between \\( 7 \\) and \\( 14 \\) is \\( 14 - 7 = 7 \\), which also satisfies the condition.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Both \\( N = 28 \\) and \\( N = 14 \\) satisfy the problem's conditions. However, since \\( 14 \\) is not an option, the correct answer must be \\( N = 28 \\).\n\n**Answer: D**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about children in a row and their positions. Hmm, let's see. I need to figure out how many children are there in total. \n\nAlright, the problem states that Neha is 12th from the left end. So if I imagine the row, she's somewhere on the left side. Radha is 6th from the right end, which means she's towards the right side. \n\nWait, the question then says that Radha is shifted two places to the left and Neha is shifted two places to the right. After this shift, there are six children between them. My goal is to find the total number of children in the row.\n\nLet me break this down step by step. Let's assign variables to make it clearer. Let's say the total number of children is N.\n\nFirst, let's find the initial positions of Neha and Radha.\n\nNeha's initial position from the left is 12. So her position is 12th. That means the position number is 12.\n\nRadha is 6th from the right. So in terms of position from the left, she's at position (N - 6 + 1) because the rightmost position is N, so 6th from right is N-6+1 = N-5. Wait, let me think again. If there are N children, the positions are numbered from 1 to N. The first child is position 1, the last is N. So if someone is 6th from the right, their position is N - 6 + 1. Because N is the last, N-1 is the second last, and so on. So for 6th from right, it's N-6+1 = N-5. So Radha is at position N-5 initially.\n\nNow, after shifting, Radha moves two places to the left. So her new position is (N-5) - 2 = N-7. Wait, wait. Because moving left decreases the position number. For example, if she's at position 5 and moves left by 2, she's at 3. So yeah, subtract 2.\n\nSimilarly, Neha moves two places to the right. So her new position is 12 + 2 = 14.\n\nNow, after the shift, the number of children between them is 6. So the distance between Radha and Neha after the shift is 6+1 = 7? Wait, no. Because if there are 6 children between them, the total positions between them is 6+1 (including both ends). Wait, no. Let me think: the number of children between two people is the difference in their positions minus 1. Because if two people are next to each other, like position 5 and 6, there are 0 children between them. So the formula is |position1 - position2| - 1.\n\nWait, no, the question says \"there are 6 children between Radha and Neha.\" So that means the number of positions between them is 6, but since positions are counted as integer steps, the actual difference in their positions would be 6 + 1 = 7. Because between positions 5 and 11, for example, the number of children is 5 (positions 6,7,8,9,10). So wait, if positions are a and b, the number of children between them is |a - b| -1. Because a and b are positions, so the count is the number of positions in between.\n\nSo the problem says there are 6 children between them, so |new_pos_Radha - new_pos_Neha| - 1 = 6. That gives |new_pos_Radha - new_pos_Neha| = 7.\n\nSo, the absolute difference between their new positions is 7.\n\nNow, let's plug in their new positions.\n\nRadha's new position is N-7, Neha's is 14.\n\nSo |(N-7) - 14| =7. \n\nThis simplifies to |N-21|=7.\n\nSo N-21 is either 7 or -7.\n\nCase 1: N-21 =7 \u2192 N=28.\n\nCase 2: N-21= -7 \u2192 N=14.\n\nWait, can N be 14? Let's think about the initial positions. If N=14, then Radha's initial position was N-5 =14-5=9. So she was at position 9. Then she moves left by 2, so 7. Neha was at 12, which is possible in a row of 14. But after shifting, her position is 14, which is within 14. So positions 7 and 14. The distance is 14-7=7. So 7-1=6 children in between. So that fits. So N could be 14 or 28.\n\nWait, but wait. The options are 23, 27, 26, 28, 29. So 14 isn't an option. So that suggests that N=28 is the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, another thought: when we shift Radha two places to the left, her new position must be at least 1, and when we shift Neha two places to the right, her new position must be at most N.\n\nSo for N=14, Radha's new position is 7, which is valid. Neha's new position is 14, which is valid. So it's possible. But 14 isn't an option, so perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's go back. Maybe I messed up the initial positions.\n\nWait, Radha's initial position is 6th from the right. So if N is the total number, Radha's position is N-6+1 = N-5. Because if there are N positions, the 6th from the right is at position N-5.\n\nWait, let me take a small example. Suppose N=6. Then the 6th from the right is position 1. Because 6-6+1=1. That makes sense. So the formula is correct.\n\nSo Radha's initial position is N-5.\n\nAfter shifting left by 2, her new position is (N-5) -2 = N-7.\n\nNeha's initial position is 12. After shifting right by 2, it's 14.\n\nSo the difference between new positions is |(N-7) -14| = |N-21|.\n\nWe know that |N-21|=7.\n\nSo N can be 28 or 14.\n\nBut the options don't have 14. So 28 must be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let's check for N=28.\n\nInitial positions: Radha is at 28-5=23. So she is at position 23. Shifting left by 2 \u2192 21.\n\nNeha is at 12. Shifting right by 2 \u219214.\n\nSo the positions are 21 (Radha) and 14 (Neha). So the distance between them is 21-14=7. So the number of children between them is 7-1=6. Which matches the problem statement.\n\nSo N=28 is correct. But wait, in the options, option D is 28.\n\nWait, but what about N=14? Let's see. If N=14, Radha's initial position is 14-5=9. Shifted left by 2:7. Neha's initial position is 12, shifted right by 2:14. So their positions are 7 and 14. The difference is 14-7=7. So the number of children between is 7-1=6, which is correct.\n\nBut why isn't 14 an option? The options are 23,27,26,28,29.\n\nSo perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe the initial positions are considered differently.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps I should model the problem differently. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nLet me represent the initial positions:\n\nLet the row have N children.\n\nNeha is 12th from the left: her initial position is 12.\n\nRadha is 6th from the right: her initial position is N -6 +1 = N-5.\n\nAfter shifting, Radha moves 2 places left: new position is (N-5) -2 = N-7.\n\nNeha moves 2 places right: new position is 12 +2=14.\n\nThe number of children between them is 6. So the number of positions between them is 6+1=7? Wait, no. Because the number of children between is the count of people in between. So if two people are at positions a and b, the number of children between is |a - b| -1.\n\nSo in this case, |(N-7) -14| -1 =6.\n\nSo |N-21| -1 =6 \u2192 |N-21|=7.\n\nWhich again gives N=28 or 14.\n\nSo same conclusion. But since 14 isn't an option, perhaps I should check if N=14 is possible.\n\nWait, if N=14, then Radha is at 9, shifts to 7. Neha is at 12, shifts to 14. So in the row, Radha is at 7, Neha at 14. The positions in between are 8,9,...13. So that's 6 children (positions 8,9,10,11,12,13). So 6 children in between. That fits. So N=14 is possible.\n\nBut why isn't it an option? Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in initial setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when Radha is shifted left by two, she can't go beyond position 1. So for N=14, N-7=7, which is fine. But what about when Radha is shifted? Let me think about N=14. Her initial position is 9. Shift left by two: 7. Which is still a valid position. So yes.\n\nBut the options don't have 14, so perhaps 28 is the answer.\n\nWait, let's see the options again. The options are A)23, B)27, C)26, D)28, E)29.\n\nSo 28 is an option, so that must be the correct one. So the answer is D)28.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Could there be another way the positions are interpreted?\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the number of children between them after shifting is 6, meaning the positions are 6 apart. So the difference in positions is 6+2=8? No, I think the initial approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the new positions have 6 children between them, meaning the distance between them is 8 (since 6 children in between means 7 positions apart). Wait, wait. Let me clarify.\n\nIf two people are at positions a and b, the number of children between them is |a - b| -1. So if there are 6 children between them, |a - b| -1 =6 \u2192 |a -b|=7.\n\nSo the positions are 7 apart.\n\nSo, the absolute difference is 7.\n\nSo Radha's new position is N-7, Neha's is 14.\n\nSo |(N-7) -14| =7 \u2192 |N-21|=7 \u2192 N=28 or 14.\n\nSo 28 is the only option present. So the answer must be 28.\n\nYes, I'm confident now.\n",

The number of children between two positions is given by the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of children between} = |\\text{Position}_1 - \\text{Position}_2| - 1\n\\]\nHere, the number of children between Radha and Neha is 6, so:\n\\[\n|(N - 7) - 14| - 1 = 6\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\n|(N - 21)| - 1 = 6 \\implies |N - 21| = 7\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Solve for \\( N \\)\nThe absolute value equation \\( |N - 21| = 7 \\) gives two possible solutions:\n1. \\( N - 21 = 7 \\implies N = 28 \\)\n2. \\( N - 21 = -7 \\implies N = 14 \\)\n\n### Step 5: Verify the Solutions\n- For \\( N = 28 \\):\n  - Radha's initial position is \\( 28 - 5 = 23 \\), and after shifting left by 2, her new position is \\( 21 \\).\n  - Neha's initial position is \\( 12 \\), and after shifting right by 2, her new position is \\( 14 \\).\n  - The distance between Radha and Neha is \\( |21 - 14| = 7 \\), and the number of children between them is \\( 7 - 1 = 6 \\), which matches the condition.\n\n- For \\( N = 14 \\):\n  - Radha's initial position is \\( 14 - 5 = 9 \\), and after shifting left by 2, her new position is \\( 7 \\).\n  - Neha's initial position is \\( 12 \\), and after shifting right by 2, her new position is \\( 14 \\).\n  - The distance between Radha and Neha is \\( |7 - 14| = 7 \\), and the number of children between them is \\( 7 - 1 = 6 \\), which also matches the condition.\n\nHowever, \\( N = 14 \\) is not among the given options. Therefore, the correct answer is \\( N = 28 \\).\n\n### Final Answer\nThe total number of children in the row is **28**.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a row of children, and two specific kids, Neha and Radha. The question gives their positions from each end and then describes how their positions change. We need to find out the total number of children in the row.\n\nFirst, let's parse the initial information. Neha is 12th from the left end. That means if we number the positions starting from the left, her position is 12. So, she's in position 12.\n\nRadha is 6th from the right end. Hmm, right end means we're counting from the opposite side. Let's say the total number of children is N. Then Radha's position from the left would be N - 6 + 1. Wait, why plus one? Oh right, because if someone is 1st from the right, they're at position N from the left. So, 6th from right is N - 6 + 1 = N -5.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I should think differently. If the row has N children, the rightmost child is at position N. So, 6th from right is position N-5. Because the first from right is N, second is N-1, up to 6th being N-5. So Radha is at position (N -5) initially.\n\nNow, the problem says that Radha is shifted to the left by 2 places. So her new position is (N-5) -2 = N-7.\n\nSimilarly, Neha is shifted to the right by 2 places. So her new position is 12 + 2 = 14.\n\nAfter these shifts, there are 6 children between Radha and Neha. So, the distance between them is 6+1 =7? Wait, wait, no. If there are 6 children between them, then the number of positions between is 6, meaning the positions are 7 apart. Because if someone is at position A and another at position B, the number of children in between is |A-B| -1. So, if |A-B| -1 =6, then |A-B|=7.\n\nSo, the positions of Radha and Neha after the shift are (N-7) and 14 respectively. The distance between them is |14 - (N-7)| =7. Wait, no, wait. The distance between them is 7 positions because they have 6 children in between.\n\nSo, the absolute difference between their new positions is 7. So, |14 - (N-7)| =7.\n\nLet's write that equation: |14 - (N -7)| =7.\n\nSimplify inside the absolute value: 14 -N +7 =21 -N. So, |21 - N| =7.\n\nThis means that 21 -N is either 7 or -7.\n\nCase 1: 21 - N =7 \u2192 N=14.\n\nCase 2: 21 - N =-7 \u2192 N=28.\n\nWait, so N could be 14 or 28. But wait, we need to check if these make sense in the context.\n\nWait, when N is 14: Let's see if that's possible. Initially, Radha is 6th from the right, which would be position (14-5)=9. Then she moves left by 2, so to position 7. Neha is initially 12th from left, which is position 12. Then she moves right by 2, so to 14. But wait, the row only has 14 positions. So position 14 is the last position. So, if Radha is at 7 and Neha at 14, the distance between them is 14-7=7 positions apart. So 6 children in between. That works. But wait, let's check the initial positions.\n\nWait, if N is 14, then Radha is 6th from right, which is position 9. So, in a row of 14, position 9 is correct. Shifting Radha to left by 2, she's at 7. That's okay.\n\nBut wait, when N=14, the initial position of Neha is 12. So that's within the row. Then she moves right by 2 to 14. So, that works. So in this scenario, the distance between them is 14-7=7, which gives 6 children between. So that seems to fit.\n\nBut wait, another case where N=28. Let's see.\n\nIf N=28, then Radha's initial position is 28 -5=23. She moves left by 2, so position 21. Neha is initially at 12, moves right to 14. So the distance between 21 and 14 is 7 positions (21-14=7). So 6 children in between. That also works.\n\nHmm, but wait. When N=14, then the initial positions are:\n\nNeha is 12th from left, so position 12. But the row has 14 children, so that's valid.\n\nRadha is 6th from right, which is position 9.\n\nAfter shifting, Radha is at 7, Neha at 14. So the distance is 14-7=7, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, the problem says when they are shifted, there are 6 children between them. So the distance is 7 positions, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, the options include 23,27,26,28,29. So 14 isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the initial positions.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Radha is 6th from the right. So if there are N children, her position is N -6 +1 = N-5.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if you're counting from the right, the first position is N, second is N-1, etc. So 6th from right is N-5.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let's think of a small N. Say N=5. 6th from right would be impossible because N is 5. So in our problem, N must be at least 6.\n\nWait, maybe I should model this differently.\n\nLet me imagine the row. Let's say the row has N children.\n\nPositions are numbered from left to right as 1,2,3,...,N.\n\nNeha's position is 12.\n\nRadha's position is N-5 (since she's 6th from right, which is N-5 +1? No, wait. Let me think: the right end is position N. So 1st from right is N, 2nd is N-1, 3rd N-2, etc. So 6th from right is N-5. So Radha is at N-5.\n\nAfter shifting, Radha moves left by 2: her new position is (N-5) -2 = N-7.\n\nNeha moves right by 2: her new position is 12+2=14.\n\nThe distance between them is |14 - (N-7)| =7. So |21 - N|=7.\n\nSo N can be 21+7=28 or 21-7=14.\n\nSo N is either 14 or 28.\n\nBut wait, when N is 14, Radha's initial position is N-5=9. After moving left by 2, she's at 7. And Neha is at 14.\n\nSo the positions are 7 and 14. The number of children between them is 14-7-1 =6. Which matches the problem statement.\n\nBut when N is 28, Radha is initially at 23. Moving left 2 to 21. Neha is at 14. So the positions are 21 and 14. The distance is 21-14=7. So the number of children between is 7-1=6. That also matches.\n\nSo N could be 14 or 28.\n\nBut looking at the options, 28 is an option (option D). 14 isn't. So perhaps 28 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but why can't N be 14? Because the options don't include 14, but the problem doesn't state that N must be in the options. Wait, no, the options are A)23, B)27, C)26, D)28, E)29. So N must be one of these.\n\nWait, but according to our calculations, N could be 14 or 28. But 14 isn't an option, so 28 must be the answer.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check for N=14. The initial positions:\n\nNeha is 12th from left, so position 12.\n\nRadha is 6th from right, which is position 9 (since 14-5=9).\n\nAfter shifting, Radha is at 7, Neha at 14. The distance between is 7 (14-7=7), which gives 6 children in between. That's correct.\n\nBut 14 is not an option, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another possibility: when Radha is shifted to the left by 2, and Neha to the right by 2, perhaps their positions cross each other. Let me think.\n\nIn the case where N=14, after shifting, Radha is at 7 and Neha at 14. So Radha is to the left of Neha. So the number of children between them is 14-7-1=6. So that's correct.\n\nBut what if N=28?\n\nRadha is at 21, Neha at 14. So Radha is to the right of Neha. The distance is 21-14=7, which gives 6 children between. That's correct.\n\nSo both N=14 and N=28 satisfy the conditions. But since 14 isn't an option, the answer must be 28.\n\nWait, but the options include 28 as option D. So the answer is D)28.\n",

Let's say the total number of children is N. So the positions are numbered from left to right as 1, 2, 3, ..., N.\n\nNeha is 12th from the left, so her position is 12. Radha is 6th from the right. Since the right end is position N, being 6th from the right means Radha is at position N - 5. Because if you're first from the right, you're at N, second is N-1, and so on. So Radha is at N-5.\n\nNow, the problem says that Radha is shifted to the left by 2 places. That means her new position is (current position) minus 2. So Radha's new position is (N-5) - 2 = N-7.\n\nNeha is shifted to the right by 2 places. Her current position is 12, so new position is 12 + 2 = 14.\n\nNow, after shifting, there are 6 children between Radha and Neha. So I need to find the distance between their new positions and set up an equation based on that.\n\nThe number of children between two positions is the absolute difference between their positions minus 1. Because if two people are at positions A and B (A < B), the number between them is B - A - 1.\n\nSo, the distance between Radha's new position (N-7) and Neha's new position (14) should be 6. Let's consider both possibilities: Radha is to the left of Neha or to the right.\n\nCase 1: Radha is to the left of Neha after shifting. So Radha's new position is less than Neha's. So:\n\nN-7 < 14.\n\nThe number of children between them is 14 - (N-7) -1 = 6.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n14 - N +7 -1 = 6\n(14+7-1) - N =6\n20 - N =6\nN=20-6=14.\n\nWait, but if N=14, Radha's original position was N-5=9. So after shifting, she's at 7. And Neha is at 14. So the distance between 7 and 14 is 14-7=7, so number of children in between is 7-1=6. That fits. But wait, is N=14 possible? Let's check the initial positions. If there are 14 children, Radha is at position 9 (since 14-5=9). But then when she moves left by 2, she goes to 7. But then, the row has 14 children, and Radha is at 7, which is within the row. Hmm, but wait, let's look at the answer options. The options start from 23, which is way higher than 14. So probably this case is invalid.\n\nCase 2: Radha is now to the right of Neha. So N-7 >14.\n\nNumber of children between them is (N-7) -14 -1 =6.\n\nSo equation:\n\n(N-7) -14 -1 =6\nN -22 =6\nN=28.\n\nSo that's one of the options, option D) 28.\n\nWait, let me check again. If N=28, then Radha's original position is 28-5=23. She shifts left by 2 to position 21. Neha shifts right from 12 to 14.\n\nSo the positions are Radha at 21, Neha at 14. Wait, no, 21 is to the right of 14? Because 21 is bigger than 14, so Radha is at 21, which is to the right of 14.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, if Radha is at 21 and Neha is at 14, then Radha is to the right of Neha. So the distance between them is 21-14=7. Number of children between them is 7-1=6. That's correct.\n\nSo N=28 is the correct answer. So the options are A)23, B)27, C)26, D)28, E)29. So the answer is D)28.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the shifting.\n\nOriginal positions:\nNeha at 12, Radha at N-5.\n\nAfter shifting:\nNeha at 14, Radha at N-7.\n\nIf N=28, Radha is at 21, Neha at 14.\n\nSo the distance between 21 and 14 is 7 positions. Number of children between them is 7-1=6. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, another possibility: Could Radha be to the left after shifting? Let's see.\n\nIf N=28, and Radha is at 21, which is to the right of 14. So in this case, Radha is to the right of Neha, so the earlier case 2 applies.\n\nWait, but in case 1, I got N=14, which isn't in the options, so that must not be the correct scenario. So the only possible value is N=28, which is option D.\n\nBut wait, another thought. When we shift Radha to the left by 2, and Neha to the right by 2, their new positions are N-7 and 14. The number of children between them is 6.\n\nAlternative approach: The distance between their new positions is 6 +1 =7, because the number of children between is 6, which means the positions are 7 apart.\n\nSo | (N-7) -14 | =7.\n\nSo two possibilities:\n\nN-7 -14 =7 \u2192 N=28.\n\nOr 14 - (N-7)=7 \u219214 - N +7=7 \u219221 -N=7 \u2192 N=14.\n\nAgain, N=14 is possible, but as before, the options don't include it, so N=28 is the only valid option.\n",

Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that Neha is 12th from the left end. That means if I imagine the row, she's the 12th person starting from the left. So, if I label their positions from left to right as 1, 2, 3, ..., then Neha is at position 12.\n\nThen, Radha is 6th from the right end. Hmm, so right end is the last position. If the total number of children is N, then Radha's original position is N - 6 + 1, right? Because counting from the right, the first position is N, then N-1, etc. So Radha is at position (N-5). Because 6th from the right is N - 5 + 1? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If it's the 1st from the right, that's position N. 2nd is N-1, so 6th would be N-5. So Radha is at position (N-5).\n\nNow, the next part says that Radha is shifted to the left by 2 places. So her new position becomes (N-5) - 2 = N-7. Because moving left decreases the position number.\n\nSimilarly, Neha is shifted to the right by 2 places. Her original position was 12, so new position is 12 + 2 = 14.\n\nNow, after these shifts, there are 6 children between Radha and Neha. So I need to find the distance between their new positions and set that equal to 6+1? Wait, wait. Because the number of children between them is 6, that would mean the positions are 7 apart. Because if two people are next to each other, there are zero children between them. So if they are k apart in positions, the number of children between is k-1. So if the number of children between is 6, the distance in positions is 7.\n\nSo, the distance between Radha and Neha after shifting is 7. So the absolute difference between their new positions is 7.\n\nRadha is at N-7, Neha at 14. So |(N-7) -14| =7.\n\nLet me write that as an equation: |(N-7) -14| =7. Simplifying inside the absolute value: N -7 -14 = N-21. So |N-21| =7.\n\nThat gives two possibilities: N-21 =7 or N-21 =-7.\n\nSo N could be 28 or 14. But wait, let's think about whether both are possible.\n\nWait, if N is 14, then Radha's original position was N-5 =14-5=9. So she was at position 9. Then she moves left by 2, so 9-2=7. But what about Neha? She was at 12, then moves right by 2 to 14. But wait, in a row of 14 children, the positions go up to 14. So moving to 14 is the last position. So that's okay.\n\nBut wait, when Radha is at position 7, and Neha at 14, the distance between them is 14-7=7. So the number of children between them is 7-1=6. So that matches the condition. So N=14 is a possible solution. But wait, looking at the options given, 14 isn't one of them. The options are 23,27,26,28,29. So N=14 isn't an option, so perhaps that's not the correct scenario.\n\nAlternatively, N-21=7 \u2192 N=28.\n\nLet me check this case. If N=28, Radha's original position is 28-5=23. Then she moves left by 2 \u2192 23-2=21. Neha was at 12, moves right by 2 \u219214. So the positions are 21 and14. So the distance is 21-14=7. So the number of children between is 6. That works.\n\nSo N=28 is a possibility. But wait, another possibility is N=14. But since 14 isn't an option, 28 must be the answer.\n\nWait, but the options have 28 as option D. So the answer would be D)28.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the equation. Because sometimes when you have absolute values, you have to consider the direction.\n\nAnother way to approach this: after shifting, Radha is at N-7 and Neha is at 14. So the number of children between them is 6. So the positions could be either Radha to the left of Neha, or vice versa.\n\nSo the distance between them is 7 positions apart. So either (N-7) -14 =7 \u2192 N-7=21 \u2192 N=28. Or 14 - (N-7) =7 \u2192 14 -N +7=7 \u2192 21 -N=7 \u2192 N=14.\n\nSo again, N=28 or 14. Since N=14 isn't an option, the answer must be 28.\n\nWait, but let me think about the shifting again. After shifting, is Radha definitely to the left of Neha, or could she be to the right?\n\nIn the original positions: Radha was at position N-5, which could be larger or smaller than 12, depending on N.\n\nIf N is 28, then Radha was at 23. 23 is to the right of 12. So after shifting, she's at 21, which is still to the right of 14 (Neha's new position). So the distance between them is 21-14=7, which gives 6 children in between.\n\nIf N=14, Radha was at 9. Shifting to 7, and Neha at 14. So Radha is at 7, which is left of 14. So the distance is 14-7=7. Which also gives 6 children in between. So both scenarios are possible.\n\nBut since N=14 isn't an option, we choose N=28.\n\nWait, but let's check the options again. The options are 23,27,26,28,29.\n\nSo 28 is option D, which would be the correct answer.\n",

But what about Neha? She was at 12, then moves right by 2 to 14. But wait, in a row of 14 children, the positions go up to 14. So moving to 14 is the last position. So that's okay.\n\nBut wait, when Radha is at position 7, and Neha at 14, the distance between them is 14-7=7. So the number of children between them is 7-1=6. So that matches the condition. So N=14 is a possible solution. But wait, looking at the options given, 14 isn't one of them. The options are 23,27,26,28,29. So N=14 isn't an option, so perhaps that's not the correct scenario.\n\nAlternatively, N-21=7 \u2192 N=28.\n\nLet me check this case. If N=28, Radha's original position is 28-5=23. Then she moves left by 2 \u2192 23-2=21. Neha was at 12, moves right by 2 \u219214. So the positions are 21 and14. So the distance is 21-14=7. So the number of children between is 6. That works.\n\nSo N=28 is a possibility. But wait, another possibility is N=14. But since 14 isn't an option, 28 must be the answer.\n\nWait, but the options have 28 as option D. So the answer would be D)28.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the equation. Because sometimes when you have absolute values, you have to consider the direction.\n\nAnother way to approach this: after shifting, Radha is at N-7 and Neha is at 14. So the number of children between them is 6. So the positions could be either Radha to the left of Neha, or vice versa.\n\nSo the distance between them is 7 positions apart. So either (N-7) -14 =7 \u2192 N-7=21 \u2192 N=28. Or 14 - (N-7) =7 \u2192 14 -N +7=7 \u2192 21 -N=7 \u2192 N=14.\n\nSo again, N=28 or 14. Since N=14 isn't an option, the answer must be 28.\n\nWait, but let me think about the shifting again. After shifting, is Radha definitely to the left of Neha, or could she be to the right?\n\nIn the original positions: Radha was at position N-5, which could be larger or smaller than 12, depending on N.\n\nIf N is 28, then Radha was at 23. 23 is to the right of 12. So after shifting, she's at 21, which is still to the right of 14 (Neha's new position). So the distance between them is 21-14=7, which gives 6 children in between.\n\nIf N=14, Radha was at 9. Shifting to 7, and Neha at 14. So Radha is at 7, which is left of 14. So the distance is 14-7=7. Which also gives 6 children in between. So both scenarios are possible.\n\nBut since N=14 isn't an option, we choose N=28.\n\nWait, but let's check the options again. The options are 23,27,26,28,29.\n\nSo 28 is option D, which would be the correct answer.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Positions**:\n   - Neha is 12th from the left end, so her initial position is **12**.\n   - Radha is 6th from the right end. If the total number of children is \\( N \\), Radha's initial position is \\( N - 5 \\).\n\n2. **After Shifting**:\n   - Radha is shifted 2 places to the left, so her new position is \\( (N - 5) - 2 = N - 7 \\).\n   - Neha is shifted 2 places to the right, so her new position is \\( 12 + 2 = 14 \\).\n\n3. **Distance Between Radha and Neha**:\n   - After shifting, there are 6 children between Radha and Neha. This means the number of positions between them is \\( 6 + 1 = 7 \\).\n   - The absolute distance between their new positions is \\( |(N - 7) - 14| = 7 \\).\n\n4. **Solving for \\( N \\)**:\n   - \\( |N - 21| = 7 \\) gives two possible solutions: \\( N - 21 = 7 \\) or \\( N - 21 = -7 \\).\n   - Solving these:\n     - \\( N - 21 = 7 \\) \u2192 \\( N = 28 \\).\n     - \\( N - 21 = -7 \\) \u2192 \\( N = 14 \\).\n\n5. **Checking Validity**:\n   - \\( N = 14 \\) is not among the given options, so it is discarded.\n   - \\( N = 28 \\) satisfies all conditions:\n     - Radha's initial position is \\( 28 - 5 = 23 \\), and after shifting left by 2, she is at \\( 21 \\).\n     - Neha's new position is \\( 14 \\).\n     - The distance between \\( 21 \\) and \\( 14 \\) is \\( 7 \\), which means there are 6 children between them.\n\nThus, the total number of children in the row is **28**.\n\nAnswer: D",
