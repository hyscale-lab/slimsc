      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about an appliance's price and figuring out the percentage it was sold above the wholesale cost. Hmm, let me try to break it down.\n\nAlright, the problem says the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost. So, if I let the wholesale cost be some number, maybe 100 for simplicity, then the retail price would be 160. Because 60% more than 100 is 160. Wait, but maybe I should use variables instead of assuming 100. Let me think.\n\nLet me denote the wholesale cost as W. Then the original retail price is 60% more than W, which is W plus 60% of W. So that's W * (1 + 0.60) = 1.6 * W. Got it.\n\nThen, the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price. So, the selling price is 20% less than 1.6W. How do I calculate that? Well, 20% of 1.6W is 0.2 * 1.6W = 0.32W. So subtracting that from 1.6W gives 1.6W - 0.32W = 1.28W. So the selling price is 1.28 times the wholesale cost.\n\nWait, but the question is asking by what percent the selling price is more than the wholesale cost. So, the selling price is 1.28W, which means it's 28% more than W. Because 1.28 is 128% of W, so 28% more than the original 100%.\n\nLet me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, W is wholesale. Retail is 1.6W. Sold for 20% less than retail: that's 1.6W * 0.80 = 1.28W. Yep, that's correct. So the percentage increase from W to selling price is (1.28W - W)/W * 100% = 0.28 * 100% = 28%.\n\nLooking at the options, B is 28%, so the answer should be B.\n",

The question is asking about the percentage increase over the wholesale cost when the appliance is sold. Hmm.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding what's given. The original retail price is 60% more than the wholesale cost. So if the wholesale cost is, say, $100, then the retail price would be $160, because 60% of 100 is 60, and 100 + 60 is 160. Wait, but maybe I should use variables instead of actual numbers to make it more general.\n\nLet me denote the wholesale cost as W. Then the original retail price is 60% more than W. So the retail price R is W plus 60% of W. That's R = W + 0.6W, which simplifies to R = 1.6W. Got that down.\n\nNow, the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price. So the selling price S is 20% less than R. How do I calculate that? Well, 20% of R is 0.2R, so subtracting that from R gives S = R - 0.2R, which is 0.8R. Oh right, so S is 80% of R.\n\nBut I want to find out what percent more S is than W. So I need to express S in terms of W. Since I already have R in terms of W, I can substitute that in. So R is 1.6W, so S = 0.8 * (1.6W). Let me compute that: 0.8 * 1.6. Hmm, 0.8 times 1 is 0.8, 0.8 times 0.6 is 0.48. Adding them together, 0.8 + 0.48 is 1.28. So S = 1.28W.\n\nWait, that means the selling price is 1.28 times the wholesale cost. So the selling price is 128% of W. But the question is asking by what percent more it was sold than the wholesale cost. So the increase is 128% minus 100%, which is 28%. So the answer should be 28%, right?\n\nLet me check that again. Suppose W is $100. Then R is $160. Then S is 80% of 160, which is 0.8 * 160 = $128. So S is $128, which is $28 more than W ($100). So that's a 28% increase. Yep, that makes sense.

Then, the original retail price is 60% more than that. So, how do I calculate that?\n\nWait, if something is 60% more than W, that's like adding 60% of W to W. So, 60% of W is 0.6 * W. So the original retail price is W + 0.6W, which is 1.6W. Oh right, because 1W + 0.6W is 1.6W.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about retail prices and wholesale costs. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The question says that the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost. Then, the appliance was sold for 20% less than that original retail price. I need to find out what percent more the selling price is compared to the wholesale cost.\n\nWait, let me get this straight. Let's denote the wholesale cost as W. The original retail price is 60% more than W. So, how do I calculate that? Oh right, 60% more would be W plus 60% of W, which is W * (1 + 0.60) = 1.60 * W. So the original retail price is 1.6W.\n\nThen, the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price. So I need to take the original price and reduce it by 20%. Wait, 20% less means we're taking 80% of the original price, right? Because 100% - 20% = 80%. So the selling price would be 1.6W multiplied by 0.80.\n\nLet me compute that. 1.6 * 0.8 is... 1.6 * 0.8. Hmm, 1 times 0.8 is 0.8, and 0.6 times 0.8 is 0.48. Adding those together gives 1.28. So the selling price is 1.28 * W.\n\nWait, so the selling price is 1.28 times the wholesale cost. That means it's 28% more than the wholesale cost, because 0.28 is the increase over 1 (which represents 100%).\n\nLet me double-check. If W is the wholesale cost, then original retail is 1.6W. Selling price is 0.8 * 1.6W = 1.28W. The increase from W to 1.28W is 0.28W, which is 28% of W. So yeah, the selling price is 28% more than the wholesale cost.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 28%. So the answer should be B.\n",

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with percentages, it's important to consider the base values. Let me think.\n\nThe problem says the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost. So, if I let the wholesale cost be a certain value, maybe I can represent it with a variable. Let's say the wholesale cost is W. Then, the original retail price would be W plus 60% of W.

Wait, so the selling price is 20% less than the original retail price. The original retail is 1.60W, so 20% less than that would be 1.60W minus 20% of 1.60W. Alternatively, it's 80% of the original retail price. Because if you take away 20%, you're left with 80%. So the selling price is 0.80 * 1.60W. Let me calculate that: 0.8 * 1.6 is... 1.28.
