      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: If m is greater than 0, y is greater than 0, and x is m percent of 4y, then in terms of y, m is what percentage of x? The options are A through E.\n\nHmm, okay, let's break this down. First, I need to translate the words into mathematical expressions. I remember that when something is a certain percentage of another thing, we can write that as a fraction over 100. So, for example, if a is p percent of b, then a = (p/100) * b.\n\nSo, the problem says x is m percent of 4y. So, mathematically, that should be x = (m/100) * 4y. Let me write that down.\n\nx = (m * 4y) / 100.\n\nSimplify that: x = (4 m y) / 100.\n\nWait, maybe I can simplify this equation further. Let's see, 4 divided by 100 is 0.04. So, x = 0.04 m y. Or, another way, x = (m y) / 25 because 4/100 is 1/25. Hmm, but maybe it's easier to keep it as x = (4 m y)/100 for now.\n\nThe question then asks: m is what percentage of x? So, I need to find m as a percentage of x. That translates to (m / x) * 100 percent.\n\nSo, let's write that down: percentage = (m / x) * 100.\n\nBut I already have x in terms of m and y. Let me substitute that into the equation. So, x is (4 m y)/100. So, substituting, we get:\n\npercentage = (m / ( (4 m y)/100 )) * 100.\n\nWait, let's simplify that. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So, m divided by (4 m y /100) is equal to m * (100)/(4 m y).\n\nLet me compute that. So, m times 100 divided by (4 m y). The m in the numerator and denominator will cancel out. So, m cancels m, leaving 100/(4 y).\n\nSo, 100 divided by 4 is 25. So, that's 25/(y). But wait, that's the value before multiplying by 100, right? Because the initial expression was (m/x)*100.\n\nWait, no. Let me double-check. The percentage is (m / x) * 100. So, substituting x, that's m divided by (4 m y / 100) times 100.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me go through it again.\n\nSo, x = (4 m y)/100. So, m divided by x is m divided by (4 m y / 100). So, m / ( (4 m y)/100 ) = m * (100)/(4 m y).\n\nYes, correct. So, the m's cancel, and we get 100/(4 y) = 25/(y). Then, this is all multiplied by 100 in the percentage formula.\n\nWait, no, wait. No, the entire expression is (m / x) * 100. So, when I compute (m/x), that's m divided by (4 m y / 100), which is m * 100/(4 m y) = 100/(4 y) = 25/y. Then, I multiply this by 100 to get the percentage. So, 25/y * 100 = 2500 / y.\n\nWait, so the percentage is 2500/y percent. So, m is (2500/y) percent of x.\n\nLet me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, let's recap:\n\nGiven x is m% of 4y: x = (m/100) * 4y = (4 m y)/100.\n\nWe need m as a percentage of x, which is (m /x)*100.\n\nSubstitute x:\n\n(m) / ( (4 m y)/100 ) * 100 = (m * 100 ) / (4 m y) * 100.\n\nWait, no, wait. The 100 is outside, so:\n\n(m /x) * 100 = [ m / (4 m y / 100) ] * 100.\n\nWhich is m * (100)/(4 m y) * 100.\n\nWait, no, no, that's not right. Because [ m divided by (4 m y /100) ] is equal to [ m * (100)/(4 m y) ) ] which is [ (100 m ) / (4 m y) ) ].\n\nThe m's cancel, giving 100/(4y) = 25/y.\n\nThen, this result (25/y) is multiplied by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nSo, 25/y * 100 = 2500 / y.\n\nSo, the percentage is (2500 / y) percent.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 2500/y, which is exactly what we got. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I make any mistake in the calculations?\n\nAlternative approach: Let's assign numbers to m and y to see if it works.\n\nLet's say m is 100, and y is 2.\n\nThen, x is m% of 4y. So, x = (100/100) * 4*2 = 1 * 8 = 8.\n\nNow, m is 100, x is 8. So, m is what percentage of x? (100 /8)*100 = 1250%.\n\nNow, according to the options, D is 2500/y. y is 2, so 2500/2 =1250. So yes, that matches.\n\nAnother test: Let m=50, y=4.\n\nx is 50% of 4*4=16. So x= 0.5 *16=8.\n\nSo, m=50, x=8. 50 is what percent of 8? (50/8)*100=625%.\n\nCompute 2500/y: y=4, 2500/4=625. Correct again.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n",

Alright, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the problem involves percentages and expressing one variable in terms of another. I remember that when something is a certain percentage of another, you can write that as a decimal multiplied by the original number.\n\nSo, x is m percent of 4y. Let me write that mathematically. m percent is m/100, right? So, x equals (m/100) multiplied by 4y. So, x = (m/100)*4y.\n\nWait, I can write that as x = (4m y) / 100. Maybe simplifying it further: x = (m y) / 25. Because 4 divided by 100 is 0.04, which is 1/25. Oh wait, wait. Wait, 4/100 is 1/25? No, 4/100 is 0.04, which is 1/25. Because 1/25 is 0.04. Yeah, that's right.\n\nWait, no, 4/100 is 0.04, which is 1/25. Wait, 25 times 4 is 100, so yeah, 4/100 is 1/25. So x equals m y divided by 25.\n\nBut the question is, m is what percentage of x. So, in other words, m is what percent of x? So, we need to find (m / x) * 100%. Because if you have a number a as a percentage of b, it's (a/b)*100%.\n\nSo, m as a percentage of x is (m / x) * 100%.\n\nWe already have x in terms of m and y. Let's plug that in. So, x is (m y)/25. So, m divided by x is m divided by (m y /25). Let me compute that.\n\nSo, m / ( (m y)/25 ) equals m * (25 / (m y)) )= (25 m) / (m y) ). Oh wait, the m's cancel out. So that's 25/(y).\n\nSo, m is 25/(y) times 100% because we have (m/x)*100%. So 25/y *100 is 2500/y percent.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check that again. Because I'm getting 25/(y), and then multiplying by 100 gives 2500/y. So, that would be 2500/y percent.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 2500/y, so that's the answer. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me assign some numbers to see if that makes sense.\n\nSuppose m is 100, y is 1. Then x is m% of 4y. So, 100% of 4*1=4. So x is 4.\n\nSo, m is 100, x is 4. So, m is 100, x is 4. So, m is what percentage of x? (100/4)*100% = 2500%. Which matches 2500/y, because y is 1. So 2500/1 is 2500. So that works.\n\nAnother example: Let y be 2. Suppose m is 50. Then x is 50% of 4*2=8. So x is 4. So, m is 50, x is 4. So, 50 is what percent of 4? 50/4 =12.5. 12.5 *100% is 1250%. 2500/y is 2500/2=1250. So that also works.\n\nHmm, so that seems to hold. So, the answer is D, which is 2500/y.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me go back to the setup.\n\nx = (m/100) *4y. So x = (4 m y)/100.\n\nThen, m is what percentage of x? So, (m / x)*100.\n\nPlugging x in:\n\n(m / ( (4 m y)/100 )) *100 = m * (100 / (4 m y )) * 100.\n\nWait, wait, no: Let me recompute.\n\n(m / x) *100 = m / [ (4 m y) / 100 ] *100.\n\nSimplify denominator: (4 m y)/100. So m divided by that is m * (100 / (4 m y)).\n\nThe m's cancel: 100/(4 y) =25/y.\n\nMultiply by 100: 25/y *100 =2500/y.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the percentage is 2500/y percent.

So, (m / x)*100.\n\nPlugging x in:\n\n(m / ( (4 m y)/100 )) *100 = m * (100 / (4 m y )) * 100.\n\nWait, wait, no: Let me recompute.\n\n(m / x) *100 = m / [ (4 m y) / 100 ] *100.\n\nSimplify denominator: (4 m y)/100. So m divided by that is m * (100 / (4 m y)).\n\nThe m's cancel: 100/(4 y) =25/y.\n\nMultiply by 100: 25/y *100 =2500/y.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the percentage is 2500/y percent. So option D is correct.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by translating the given information into mathematical expressions. \n\n1. The problem states that \\( x \\) is \\( m \\)% of \\( 4y \\). This can be written as:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{m}{100} \\cdot 4y = \\frac{4my}{100} = \\frac{my}{25}.\n   \\]\n\n2. The question asks for \\( m \\) as a percentage of \\( x \\). To find this, we use the formula for percentage:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{m}{x} \\right) \\cdot 100\\%.\n   \\]\n\n3. Substituting \\( x = \\frac{my}{25} \\) into the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{m}{x} = \\frac{m}{\\frac{my}{25}} = \\frac{m \\cdot 25}{my} = \\frac{25}{y}.\n   \\]\n\n4. Multiplying by 100% to express as a percentage:\n   \\[\n   \\left( \\frac{25}{y} \\right) \\cdot 100\\% = \\frac{2500}{y}\\%.\n   \\]\n\nThus, \\( m \\) is \\( \\frac{2500}{y}\\% \\) of \\( x \\). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is **D**.\n\nTo verify, consider an example where \\( m = 100 \\) and \\( y = 1 \\). Then:\n- \\( x = \\frac{4my}{100} = \\frac{4 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 1}{100} = 4 \\).\n- \\( m \\) as a percentage of \\( x \\) is \\( \\frac{100}{4} \\cdot 100\\% = 2500\\% \\), which matches \\( \\frac{2500}{y} \\) when \\( y = 1 \\).\n\nAnother example with \\( m = 50 \\) and \\( y = 2 \\):\n- \\( x = \\frac{4my}{100} = \\frac{4 \\cdot 50 \\cdot 2}{100} = 4 \\).\n- \\( m \\) as a percentage of \\( x \\) is \\( \\frac{50}{4} \\cdot 100\\% = 1250\\% \\), which matches \\( \\frac{2500}{y} \\) when \\( y = 2 \\).\n\nBoth examples confirm the correctness of the solution.\n\nAnswer: D",

Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question says: If m is greater than 0, y is greater than 0, and x is m percent of 4y, then, in terms of y, m is what percentage of x? And the options are given as A to E.\n\nHmm. So, let's break this down. First, x is m percent of 4y. I think that means x is equal to (m/100) multiplied by 4y. Because when something is a certain percentage of another, you convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply.\n\nSo, writing that out: x = (m/100) * 4y. Let me compute that. 4y times m/100 is (4m y)/100, which can be simplified to (m y)/25. Because 4 divided by 100 is 0.04, which is 1/25. So x = (m y)/25.\n\nBut the question is asking, m is what percentage of x? So I need to express m as a percentage of x. That means I need to find (m / x) * 100%, right?\n\nWait, wait. So, percentage formula is (part / whole) * 100. Here, the part is m, and the whole is x. So yes, (m / x) * 100%.\n\nSo I need to compute m divided by x, then multiply by 100. But since x is in terms of m and y, I can substitute the value of x from earlier.\n\nWe have x = (m y)/25. So, m / x equals m divided by (m y)/25.\n\nLet me compute that. So, m divided by (m y /25) is equal to m multiplied by (25)/(m y). The m in the numerator and denominator will cancel out. So, it's 25/(y).\n\nWait, that's 25 divided by y. So, m / x = 25 / y.\n\nThen, to find the percentage, we multiply by 100. So, (25 / y) * 100 = 2500 / y.\n\nSo, m is 2500/y percent of x. Let me check the options.

Correct.\n\nThen, m is what percentage of x? So (m / x) * 100.\n\nSubstituting x: (m / (m y /25)) * 100. The m cancels, so (1/(y/25)) * 100 = (25/y) *100 = 2500/y.

Let's write that again: x = (4 m y) / 100. I can rearrange this equation to solve for m in terms of x and y.\n\nSo, starting with x = (4 m y)/100. Let's multiply both sides by 100 to get rid of the denominator: 100x = 4 m y. Then, divide both sides by 4y: (100x)/(4y) = m.\n\nSimplify that: 100 divided by 4 is 25, so m = (25x)/(y). So m is (25x)/y.\n\nNow, I need to find what percentage m is of x. So, (m / x) * 100%. Let's substitute m with (25x)/y.\n\nSo, ( (25x)/y ) / x ) * 100. Let's compute this step by step. The x in the numerator and denominator will cancel out. So, (25x)/(y) divided by x is 25/(y) times x/x, which is 25/(y) * 1, which is 25/y.\n\nSo, (25/y) * 100% equals (25 * 100) / y %, which is 2500 / y percent.\n\nWait, let me make sure I did that correctly. So, m is (25x)/y. So when I compute (m / x), that's (25x/y) / x. The x's cancel, so it's 25/(y). Multiply by 100, so 25 * 100 = 2500, divided by y. So yes, 2500/y percent.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 2500/y. So the answer should be D.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my steps because sometimes I might make a mistake in algebra.\n\n1. x is m% of 4y. So x = (m/100) *4y. Correct.\n2. Rearranged to solve for m: x = (4 m y)/100 \u2192 100x = 4 m y \u2192 m = (100x)/(4y) = 25x/y. Correct.\n3. Then, m is what percentage of x? So (m /x ) *100% = (25x/y /x)*100 = (25/y)*100 = 2500/y. So yes, correct.\n\nSo the answer is D.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by translating the given information into mathematical expressions. Since \\( x \\) is \\( m \\)% of \\( 4y \\), we can write:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{m}{100} \\cdot 4y\n\\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4my}{100}\n\\]\n\nRearranging this equation to solve for \\( m \\), we multiply both sides by 100:\n\n\\[\n100x = 4my\n\\]\n\nThen, divide both sides by \\( 4y \\):\n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{100x}{4y} = \\frac{25x}{y}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine what percentage \\( m \\) is of \\( x \\). This is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{m}{x} \\right) \\cdot 100\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( m = \\frac{25x}{y} \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\frac{25x}{y}}{x} \\right) \\cdot 100 = \\left( \\frac{25}{y} \\right) \\cdot 100 = \\frac{2500}{y}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( m \\) is \\( \\frac{2500}{y} \\)% of \\( x \\).

Well, if x is m% of something, that something is 4y here. So, the formula for a percentage is (percentage/100) multiplied by the base. So x equals (m/100) multiplied by 4y.

Let me rearrange that equation.\n\nMultiply both sides by 100: 100x = 4 m y.\n\nThen, divide both sides by 4y: m = (100x) / (4y).\n\nSimplify that: 100 divided by 4 is 25, so m = (25x)/y.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for m as a percentage of x.

Hmm, wait, 4/100 is 0.04, which is 1/25. So, x = m y /25.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express x correctly.\n\nx = (m/100) *4y \u2192 4y * m /100 \u2192 (4 m y)/100 \u2192 (m y)/25.\n\nSo, x = (m y)/25. So, solving for m, we get m = (25 x)/y.\n\nSo, m is (25x)/y.

Then, multiply by 100 to get percentage: 25/y *100 =2500/y.\n\nYes, so that's correct. So, the percentage is 2500 divided by y. Which matches option D. So, the answer should be D.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by translating the given information into an equation. Since \\( x \\) is \\( m\\% \\) of \\( 4y \\), we can write:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{m}{100} \\cdot 4y\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4my}{100}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find \\( m \\) as a percentage of \\( x \\). This is expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{m}{x} \\right) \\cdot 100\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( x = \\frac{4my}{100} \\) into the equation, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{m}{\\frac{4my}{100}} \\right) \\cdot 100\n\\]\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{m \\cdot 100}{4my} \\right) \\cdot 100\n\\]\n\nThe \\( m \\) terms cancel out, leaving:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{100}{4y} \\right) \\cdot 100\n\\]\n\nSimplify further:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\frac{10000}{4y} = \\frac{2500}{y}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( m \\) is \\( \\frac{2500}{y}\\% \\) of \\( x \\). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:\n\n**D) \\( \\frac{2500}{y} \\)**\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right approach. Let's see what it's about.\n\nThe problem says: If m is greater than 0, y is greater than 0, and x is m percent of 4y, then, in terms of y, m is what percentage of x? Hmm, I need to find m as a percentage of x, expressed in terms of y.\n\nWait, let's break it down. First, I know that when a number is a certain percentage of another, I can express it as a fraction. Like, if A is p percent of B, then A = (p/100) * B. So in this case, x is m percent of 4y. That means x = (m/100) * 4y. Oh, right, that's the starting point.\n\nSo, writing that out: x = (m * 4y) / 100. Simplifying that, x = (4 m y) / 100. Wait, or is it (m * 4y)/100? Yes, same thing.\n\nNow, the question is asking for m as a percentage of x. So, m is what percentage of x? That would translate to (m / x) * 100%. Because if you want to find what percentage A is of B, it's (A/B)*100%.\n\nSo I need to express m as a percentage of x. So, let's write that expression: (m / x) * 100%.\n\nBut I already have x in terms of m and y, so I can substitute that in. Let me substitute x from earlier.\n\nSo x is (4 m y) / 100. So substituting into (m / x) *100%, that becomes m divided by (4 m y / 100) multiplied by 100.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n(m / x) * 100% = m / ( (4 m y)/100 ) * 100%\n\nHmm, let's compute that. Let's first compute the denominator: (4 m y)/100. So when you divide by that, it's the same as multiplying by 100/(4 m y).\n\nSo m multiplied by (100/(4 m y)) and then multiplied by 100.\n\nWait, let me do the steps step by step.\n\nSo:\n\n(m) divided by ( (4 m y)/100 ) equals m multiplied by (100/(4 m y)).\n\nSo that's (m * 100) / (4 m y).\n\nThe m in the numerator and denominator cancel out. So we have 100/(4 y) = 25 / y.\n\nWait, because 100 divided by 4 is 25. So 100/4y is 25/y.\n\nThen, we multiply that by 100% because the expression is (m/x)*100%, which is (25/y) *100% = 2500/y %.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, no, let me double-check. Because in the initial substitution, the entire (m/x) is multiplied by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nWait, let me redo the calculation:\n\n(m / x) * 100% = [m / ( (4 m y)/100 ) ] * 100%\n\nSo, let's compute the division first. m divided by (4 m y / 100) is equal to m * (100 / (4 m y)).\n\nThe m's cancel: m in numerator and denominator. So we have 100/(4 y) = 25/y.\n\nSo now, 25/y multiplied by 100% gives (25/y)*100% = 2500/y %.\n\nWait, but 25/y multiplied by 100 is 2500/y. So yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo m is (2500/y) percent of x. So looking at the options, option D is 2500/y. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did everything correctly. Let's go through each step again.\n\n1. x is m% of 4y: x = (m/100)*4y = (4 m y)/100. Correct.\n\n2. m is what percentage of x: (m / x) *100%. Correct.\n\n3. Substitute x: (m / ( (4 m y)/100 )) *100% = [ m * 100 / (4 m y) ] *100%.\n\nSimplify: [ (100 m ) / (4 m y) ) ] *100% \u2192 (100/(4 y)) *100% \u2192 (25/y)*100% = 2500/y %.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer is D: 2500/y.\n",
