      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the cost of gardening around a rectangular plot. Hmm, let's see. The plot has a perimeter of 340 meters, and we need to create a 1-meter broad boundary around it. The rate is 10 per square meter. The options are A to E, and I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nWait, wait. So the problem is asking for the cost of gardening a 1-meter boundary around the plot. So that's like adding a strip around the rectangle. I think the area of this boundary is what we're after because the cost is per square meter.\n\nFirst, I remember that the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as 2*(length + width). Oh right, the perimeter here is 340 meters. So 2*(l + w) = 340. That means l + w = 170 meters. But I don't know the individual lengths of l and w, so maybe I can find the area of the boundary without knowing them specifically.\n\nThe boundary is 1 meter wide all around. So when you add a 1-meter strip around a rectangle, the new dimensions become (l+2) meters in length and (w+2) meters in width because you're adding 1 meter on each side.\n\nThe area of the original plot is l * w. The area including the boundary would be (l+2)*(w+2). So the area of just the boundary is the new area minus the original area.\n\nLet me calculate that: (l+2)(w+2) - l*w. Expanding that, it's l*w + 2l + 2w +4 - l*w = 2l + 2w +4. Which simplifies to 2(l + w) +4.\n\nWait, I know that l + w is 170, from earlier. So plugging that in: 2*(170) +4 = 340 +4 = 344 square meters.\n\nOh, so the area of the boundary is 344 square meters. Now, the cost is 10 per square meter, so 344 * 10 equals 3440.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 3440. So that should be the answer.\n\nBut wait, did I make a mistake anywhere? Let me double-check. The area of the path around the rectangle is the area of the larger rectangle minus the original. Yes, that's correct. And since the perimeter is given, I used l + w = 170, which is correct because 2*(l +w)=340. Then the expansion of (l+2)(w+2) gives the terms correctly. So yes, I think the calculation is right.\n",

The plot has a perimeter of 340 metres, and the rate is 10 per square metre. Hmm, I need to figure out the total cost. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as 2*(length + width). So, if the perimeter is 340 meters, then 2*(l + w) = 340. Dividing both sides by 2 gives l + w = 170. That's the sum of the length and width of the plot. But wait, I don't know the individual values of length and width, just their sum. So maybe I don't need them specifically?\n\nThe problem is about the area of the boundary. Since the boundary is 1 metre wide around the plot, I think this is similar to finding the area of a larger rectangle minus the area of the original plot. But wait, when you add a border around a rectangle, the new dimensions would be increased by twice the border width because you add the border on both sides. Oh right, because on each side you add 1m, so for length and width, each increases by 1m on both ends. So the new length would be l + 2*1 = l+2, and the new width would be w + 2.\n\nSo the area of the larger plot (including the boundary) is (l+2)*(w+2), and the area of the original plot is l*w. The area of the boundary alone would be the difference between these two.\n\nLet me write that down: Area of boundary = (l+2)(w+2) - l*w.\n\nExpanding that, it's l*w + 2l + 2w + 4 - l*w. The l*w terms cancel out, so it's 2l + 2w +4.\n\nWait, but from earlier, I know that l + w = 170. So 2l + 2w is 2*(l + w) = 2*170 = 340. So the area becomes 340 +4 = 344 square metres.\n\nWait, that makes sense? Because when you add a 1m border around, the extra area is just 2(l + w) +4. Oh, because the border adds 2m to each dimension, so the area is like a frame around the rectangle.\n\nSo the area to be gardened is 344 m\u00b2. The rate is 10 per square metre, so the cost would be 344 * 10 = 3440. Looking at the options, option C is 3440.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I make any mistake in calculating the area of the boundary? Because sometimes when you have a border, especially around a rectangle, you can also think of it as the perimeter multiplied by the width of the border plus the corners. Oh wait, but I think I did that correctly.\n\nAnother approach: The area of the border can be thought of as the perimeter of the original plot multiplied by the width of the border (1m), plus the area added by the four corners. Since each corner is a square of 1m x1m, four corners add 4*1=4 m\u00b2. So perimeter is 340 m, multiply by 1m width gives 340 m\u00b2, plus 4 m\u00b2 gives 344 m\u00b2 total. Yep, same as before.

So, the boundary is 1 meter wide all around the rectangle. That means the area we're calculating is the area of this 1-meter strip around the original plot.

But another way to think about it might be to calculate the area of the border directly.\n\nWait, let's think. The original plot has a perimeter of 340 meters. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + width) = 340. So length plus width equals 170.\n\nBut without knowing the exact length and width, how can I find the area of the border?

So, the area of the border would be the perimeter of the original plot multiplied by the width of the border, plus the area added at the corners. Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me think again.\n\nActually, when you add a border of width 'w' around a rectangle, the area of the border is equal to the perimeter of the original rectangle multiplied by 'w' plus 4*w\u00b2. Because when you add the border, each corner has a square of w x w, and there are four corners. Alternatively, it's like the perimeter times the width, plus the four squares which add up to 4*w\u00b2. So in this case, w is 1.\n\nSo the area of the border would be perimeter * w + 4*w\u00b2.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the cost of gardening around a rectangular plot. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nThe question says that there's a rectangular plot with a perimeter of 340 meters, and they want to create a 1-meter broad boundary around it. The rate is 10 per square meter, and I need to find the cost. The options are given, so I'll have to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I think I should visualize the plot. It's a rectangle, so it has two lengths and two breadths. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as 2*(length + breadth). Here, the perimeter is 340 meters. So, 2*(l + b) = 340. That simplifies to l + b = 170. Okay, so the sum of the length and breadth is 170 meters.\n\nNow, the boundary is 1 meter wide around the plot. So, when you add a 1-meter strip around all sides of a rectangle, the new dimensions (for the area to be gardened) would be larger by 2 meters each in both length and breadth. Wait, why? Because adding 1 meter on each side\u2014so for the length, it's +1 on both ends, making it +2. Same for the breadth. So, the area of the boundary would be the area of the larger rectangle minus the area of the original plot.\n\nLet me think. Let's denote the original length as l and breadth as b. The area of the original plot is l*b. The new dimensions after adding the boundary would be (l + 2) and (b + 2). So, the area of the new plot is (l+2)*(b+2). The area of the boundary itself is the difference between these two: (l+2)(b+2) - l*b.\n\nLet me expand that: (l*b + 2l + 2b +4) - l*b = 2l + 2b +4. Which simplifies to 2*(l + b) +4. Oh, interesting. Because from earlier, l + b is 170. So substituting that in: 2*(170) +4 = 340 +4 = 344.\n\nWait, that's the area of the boundary in square meters. Then, the cost is 10 per square meter. So total cost would be 344 *10 = 3440.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 3440. So the answer should be C.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Because sometimes, the way the boundary is added could be different. Let me think again. The boundary is 1 meter around, so the area added is a 1m strip around all four sides. Alternatively, the area can be calculated as the perimeter multiplied by the width of the strip, plus the area of the corners. Because when you add a strip, the corners are squares of 1m x1m each.\n\nWait, another approach: The area of the boundary (the path) can be calculated as perimeter * width + 4*(width^2). Because the path is a rectangle around the original, but when you compute the area, the perimeter gives the length part, but the corners add extra squares.\n\nWait, in this case, the width is 1m. So, perimeter is 340 m. So area would be 340 *1 = 340. Plus 4*(1*1) =4. So total area is 340+4=344. Same as before. So yes, that confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nSo the area is 344 m\u00b2. Multiply by 10, which gives 3440, so option C is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have tried plugging in some numbers. For example, suppose the plot is a square. Wait, but it's a rectangle. If the perimeter is 340, then for a square, each side would be 340/4=85 meters. Then the area would be 85*85=7225. The boundary area would be (85+2)^2 -85^2 = (87^2 -85^2). Which is (87-85)(87+85) = 2*172=344. So again, same result. So regardless of the shape, as long as the perimeter is 340, the area of the boundary is 344. So the cost is 344*10=3440.\n\nThus, the correct answer is C.\n",

Let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nThe problem says there's a rectangular plot with a perimeter of 340 meters. They want to create a 1-meter broad boundary around it. The rate is 10 per square meter. I need to find the cost, and the options are given.\n\nHmm, wait. Wait, the question is about the cost of gardening a 1-meter boundary. So I think that means we're adding a strip of 1 meter around the entire plot. So the area we need to calculate is the area of this boundary.\n\nBut how do I find the area of that boundary? Well, when you add a border around a rectangle, the new area becomes (original length + 2*border) and (original width + 2*border), because the border adds to both sides. So the area including the border is (L+2)* (W+2), but wait, no. Wait, the border is 1m wide, so each side is increased by 1m on both ends. So the total increase in length is 2m (1m on each side), same for width.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the perimeter is given as 340 meters. The perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(L + W). So 2(L + W) = 340, which means L + W = 170. So L + W is 170 meters.\n\nBut to find the area of the boundary, which is the area of the larger rectangle (including the 1m border) minus the area of the original plot. Because the boundary is that extra area.\n\nSo let me denote the original length as L and width as W. The original area is L * W.\n\nThe larger rectangle, after adding 1m border on all sides, would have length (L + 2) and width (W + 2). So the area is (L+2)(W+2). \n\nSo the area of the boundary is (L+2)(W+2) - L*W. Let's expand that.\n\n(L+2)(W+2) = L*W + 2L + 2W +4. Subtract L*W, we get 2L + 2W +4. \n\nWait, so the area of the boundary is 2L + 2W +4. Alternatively, 2(L + W) +4. \n\nBut we know that L + W is 170 meters, from the perimeter. So substituting that in: 2*(170) +4 = 340 +4= 344 square meters. \n\nSo the area is 344 m\u00b2. \n\nThe rate is 10 per square meter, so the cost would be 344 * 10 = 3440. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 3440. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check. Another way to think about it is that the boundary is 1m wide all around, so it's like a frame. The area can also be calculated as the perimeter multiplied by the width of the border, plus the corners. Wait, no, because when you have a border, the area is perimeter * width + 4*(width)^2. Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, no. Another approach: when you have a border of width w around a rectangle, the area is (perimeter)*w + 4w\u00b2. Because each corner is a square of w x w, and there are four of them. So in this case, w is 1m.\n\nSo perimeter is 340 m, w=1. So area would be 340 *1 +4*(1)^2 = 340 +4= 344 m\u00b2. Same result as before.\n\nSo yeah, 344 m\u00b2, cost is 344*10=3440, which is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the cost of gardening around a rectangular plot. Let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nThe problem says there's a rectangular plot with a perimeter of 340 meters. They want to create a 1-meter broad boundary around it. The rate is 10 per square meter. I need to find the cost, and the options are given.\n\nHmm, wait. Wait, the question is about the cost of gardening a 1-meter boundary. So I think that means we're adding a strip of 1 meter around the entire plot. So the area we need to calculate is the area of this boundary.\n\nBut how do I find the area of that boundary? Well, when you add a border around a rectangle, the new area becomes (original length + 2*border) and (original width + 2*border), because the border adds to both sides. So the area including the border is (L+2)* (W+2), but wait, no. Wait, the border is 1m wide, so each side is increased by 1m on both ends. So the total increase in length is 2m (1m on each side), same for width.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the perimeter is given as 340 meters. The perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(L + W). So 2(L + W) = 340, which means L + W = 170. So L + W is 170 meters.\n\nBut to find the area of the boundary, which is the area of the larger rectangle (including the 1m border) minus the area of the original plot. Because the boundary is that extra area.\n\nSo let me denote the original length as L and width as W. The original area is L * W.\n\nThe larger rectangle, after adding 1m border on all sides, would have length (L + 2) and width (W + 2). So the area is (L+2)(W+2). \n\nSo the area of the boundary is (L+2)(W+2) - L*W. Let's expand that.\n\n(L+2)(W+2) = L*W + 2L + 2W +4. Subtract L*W, we get 2L + 2W +4. \n\nWait, so the area of the boundary is 2L + 2W +4. Alternatively, 2(L + W) +4. \n\nBut we know that L + W is 170 meters, from the perimeter. So substituting that in: 2*(170) +4 = 340 +4= 344 square meters. \n\nSo the area is 344 m\u00b2. \n\nThe rate is 10 per square meter, so the cost would be 344 * 10 = 3440. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 3440. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check. Another way to think about it is that the boundary is 1m wide all around, so it's like a frame. The area can also be calculated as the perimeter multiplied by the width of the border, plus the corners. Wait, no, because when you have a border, the area is perimeter * width + 4*(width)^2. Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, no. Another approach: when you have a border of width w around a rectangle, the area is (perimeter)*w + 4w\u00b2. Because each corner is a square of w x w, and there are four of them. So in this case, w is 1m.\n\nSo perimeter is 340 m, w=1. So area would be 340 *1 +4*(1)^2 = 340 +4= 344 m\u00b2. Same result as before.\n\nSo yeah, 344 m\u00b2, cost is 344*10=3440, which is option C.\n\n\nThe problem involves calculating the cost of gardening a 1-meter-wide boundary around a rectangular plot with a perimeter of 340 meters, at a rate of 10 per square meter.\n\n1. **Understanding the boundary area**: The boundary is a 1-meter-wide strip around the rectangular plot. To calculate its area, we can subtract the area of the original plot from the area of the larger rectangle (including the boundary).\n\n2. **Perimeter relationship**: The perimeter of the rectangle is given as 340 meters. For a rectangle, the perimeter is \\(2(L + W)\\), where \\(L\\) is the length and \\(W\\) is the width. Thus, \\(2(L + W) = 340\\), which simplifies to \\(L + W = 170\\).\n\n3. **Area of the boundary**: The larger rectangle, including the 1-meter boundary, has dimensions \\((L + 2)\\) and \\((W + 2)\\). Its area is \\((L + 2)(W + 2)\\). Expanding this gives:\n   \\[\n   (L + 2)(W + 2) = L \\cdot W + 2L + 2W + 4\n   \\]\n   Subtracting the original area \\(L \\cdot W\\), the area of the boundary is:\n   \\[\n   2L + 2W + 4\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(L + W = 170\\), the area becomes:\n   \\[\n   2(170) + 4 = 340 + 4 = 344 \\, \\text{m}^2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Cost calculation**: The rate is 10 per square meter, so the total cost is:\n   \\[\n   344 \\times 10 = 3440\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verification**: Another approach to calculate the boundary area is using the formula for the area of a border around a rectangle:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of boundary} = \\text{Perimeter} \\times \\text{Width of border} + 4 \\times (\\text{Width of border})^2\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of boundary} = 340 \\times 1 + 4 \\times 1^2 = 340 + 4 = 344 \\, \\text{m}^2\n   \\]\n   This confirms the earlier result.\n\nThus, the total cost is \\(3440\\), which corresponds to option C.\n\nAnswer: C",

The rate is 10 per square meter, and I need to find the cost.\n\nHmm, wait, so the boundary is 1 meter wide all around the rectangle. I think that means the area we're calculating is this border around the original plot. But wait, how do I find the area of this boundary?\n\nLet me visualize this. The boundary is like a bigger rectangle surrounding the original one. Since the boundary is 1 meter wide, the bigger rectangle's length and width are each 2 meters longer than the original. Because on each side, the length and width increase by 1 meter. So if the original is length L and width W, the outer dimensions would be L+2 and W+2, right?\n\nBut wait, the perimeter of the original plot is 340 meters. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2(L + W). So 2(L + W) = 340. Dividing both sides by 2 gives L + W = 170. Hmm, okay, so L plus W equals 170.\n\nBut I'm trying to find the area of the boundary, which is the area of the bigger rectangle minus the area of the original plot. Let me denote the area of the original as A1 and the bigger as A2. So the area of the boundary is A2 - A1.\n\nCalculating A1 is straightforward: it's L multiplied by W. A2 is (L+2) multiplied by (W+2). So A2 - A1 = (L+2)(W+2) - L*W.\n\nLet me expand that: (L*W + 2L + 2W +4) - L*W. The L*W terms cancel out, leaving 2L + 2W +4.

So the area would be the perimeter multiplied by the width, plus the corners. Wait, no, that's another way to think about it. Because the area can also be calculated as perimeter multiplied by the width of the border plus the area added by the four corners.\n\nWait, let me think. The area of the border is equal to the perimeter of the original plot multiplied by the width of the border, plus the area of the four corners. Each corner is a square of 1x1 meter, so four corners make 4 square meters. So the area would be 340 *1 +4= 344. Which matches my earlier calculation.
