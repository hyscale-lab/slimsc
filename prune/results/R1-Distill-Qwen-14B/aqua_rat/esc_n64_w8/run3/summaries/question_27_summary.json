      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Rahul borrowing money with simple interest. Hmm, let's see. I remember that simple interest is calculated using a specific formula. Oh right, the formula for simple interest is I = P * R * T, where P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest per annum, and T is the time in years.\n\nSo the problem says Rahul borrowed Rs. 500 at 6% per annum simple interest. He's going to pay it back after 4 years. I need to find out the total amount he'll pay, which includes the principal plus the interest.\n\nLet me break it down. The principal, P, is Rs. 500. The rate, R, is 6%, which as a decimal is 0.06. The time, T, is 4 years. Plugging these into the formula: I = 500 * 0.06 * 4.\n\nWait, let's compute that step by step. First, 500 multiplied by 0.06. 500 * 0.06 is 30. Because 1% of 500 is 5, so 6% is 30. Then, multiply that by 4 years. 30 *4 is 120. So the interest over four years is Rs. 120.\n\nNow, the total amount he has to pay is the principal plus the interest. So 500 plus 120 equals 620. Looking at the options, option C is 620. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, did I make any mistakes? Let me check the calculation again. 500 *0.06 is 30. 30 *4 is 120. Total is 620. Yeah, that seems right. So the correct option is C) 620.\n",

Let me check the options. Option C is 620. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recalculate. 500 *6% is 30 per year. 30 for four years is 120. So 500+120=620. Yep, that's correct. So the correct answer should be option C.\n\n\nTo determine the total amount Rahul will pay to clear the debt after 4 years, we use the simple interest formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Interest (I)} = P \\times R \\times T\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( P = 500 \\) (principal amount),\n- \\( R = 6\\% = 0.06 \\) (annual interest rate),\n- \\( T = 4 \\) years.\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\nI = 500 \\times 0.06 \\times 4 = 30 \\times 4 = 120\n\\]\n\nThe total amount to be paid back is the sum of the principal and the interest:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Amount} = P + I = 500 + 120 = 620\n\\]\n\nThus, Rahul will pay Rs. 620 to clear the debt after 4 years. The correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about simple interest. Let me think about it step by step. Hmm, the question is about Rahul borrowing money and calculating how much he'll pay back after a certain period. \n\nAlright, the details given: Rahul borrowed Rs. 500 at 6% per annum simple interest. He needs to pay back after 4 years. I need to find the total amount he'll pay. \n\nWait, I remember that simple interest is calculated using the formula I = P * R * T, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time in years. Then the total amount to be paid back is the principal plus the interest, so A = P + I.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. The principal P is 500. The rate R is 6%, which as a decimal is 0.06. Time T is 4 years. So calculating the interest first: I = 500 * 0.06 * 4.\n\nLet me compute that. 500 multiplied by 0.06 is 30. Then 30 multiplied by 4 is 120. So the interest is 120 rupees.\n\nNow, adding that to the principal to get the total amount. 500 + 120 equals 620. So the total amount Rahul will pay is 620 rupees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 620. So that should be the correct answer. Wait, but I should make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me double-check the math.\n\n500 * 0.06 is indeed 30 because 500 * 6% is 30. Multiply that by 4 years, 30 *4 is 120. So yes, adding 500 gives 620. Yep, that looks right. So the answer must be option C.\n",

The principal P is 500. The rate R is 6%, which I should probably convert to a decimal for calculation. So 6% is 0.06. The time T is 4 years.\n\nCalculating the interest: I = 500 * 0.06 * 4.
