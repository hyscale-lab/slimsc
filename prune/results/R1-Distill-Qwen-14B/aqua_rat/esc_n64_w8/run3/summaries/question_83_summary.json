      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with GCF and LCM problems, but I'll give it a shot. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe problem says: The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700. One of the integers is 350, and we need to find the other one. The options are A) 242, B) 308, C) 352, D)412, E)456.\n\nHmm, I remember there's a relationship between GCF and LCM of two numbers. Oh right! The product of the two numbers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM. So, if I denote the two numbers as a and b, then a * b = GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b). That's the formula I need to use here.\n\nWait, so let's write that down. Let me assign a = 350, and b is the unknown we're trying to find. The GCF is 11, and the LCM is 7700. So according to the formula, 350 * b = 11 * 7700.\n\nLet me compute the right side first. 11 multiplied by 7700. Hmm, 7700 divided by 11 is 700, so 11*7700 would be 7700 * 11. Let me calculate that: 7700 * 10 is 77000, plus 7700 is 84700. So the product a*b is 84700.\n\nSo, 350 * b = 84700. To find b, I can divide both sides by 350. So b = 84700 / 350.\n\nLet me compute that. Let's see, 84700 divided by 350. Hmm, maybe I can simplify this division. Let's see, both numerator and denominator can be divided by 10 first. So that becomes 8470 / 35.\n\nWait, 35 times 242 is 8470 because 35 times 240 is 8400, and 35*2=70, so 8400+70=8470. So 8470 divided by 35 is 242. So b is 242. But wait, let me double-check that calculation because sometimes I make mistakes in arithmetic.\n\nWait, 35 * 242. Let me compute that. 35 times 200 is 7000, 35 times 40 is 1400, 35 times 2 is 70. Adding them together: 7000 + 1400 is 8400, plus 70 is 8470. Oh yeah, that's correct. So 35 * 242 = 8470, so 84700 / 350 is indeed 242.\n\nSo the other number is 242. Let me check the options. Option A is 242. So that's the answer? But wait, I should make sure that 242 and 350 indeed have a GCF of 11 and an LCM of 7700.\n\nLet me verify the GCF first. The GCF of 350 and 242.\n\nBreaking down 350 into prime factors: 350 = 2 * 5^2 * 7. Wait, 2 * 5 *5 *7.\n\n242: Let's see, 242 divided by 2 is 121, which is 11 squared. So 242 = 2 * 11^2.\n\nSo the common factors between 350 and 242: both have a 2. So the GCF is 2. Wait a minute, that's a problem. Because the problem states that the GCF is 11, but according to this, it's 2. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because I thought the formula was a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). Did I apply it correctly?\n\nWait, let me recheck. So a = 350, b = 242. GCF is 2, as per their prime factors. So 350 * 242 = (2) * (7700) ?\n\nWait, 350 * 242 is 84700. The product of GCF and LCM would be 2 * 7700 = 15400, which is way less than 84700. So that's not possible. So that means I must have made a mistake in my initial approach.\n\nWait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me go back to the problem. The GCF is 11. So both numbers must be multiples of 11. But 350 is 35 * 10, which is 5*7 * 2*5. So 350 is 2 * 5^2 * 7. Hmm, that doesn't have 11 as a factor. So that's a problem. Because the GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11.\n\nWait a second, that's a mistake. If the GCF is 11, then both numbers must be divisible by 11. But 350 is 350 divided by 11? Let me check: 11*31 is 341, 11*32 is 352. So 350 divided by 11 is 31.81..., which is not an integer. So 350 is not divisible by 11. That's a problem because the GCF is 11. So that would imply that both numbers must be multiples of 11.\n\nWait, but the problem says one of the numbers is 350. But 350 isn't a multiple of 11, which contradicts the GCF being 11. So perhaps I've made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, maybe I misapplied the formula. Let me think again. The formula is a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So if GCF is 11, then 350 * b = 11 * 7700.\n\nWait, but if 350 isn't a multiple of 11, then b must be a multiple of 11, but when you multiply 350 and b, which is a multiple of 11, then 350*b must be a multiple of 11, which it is because 11*7700 is 84700, which is 11 times something.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is that I'm not considering that the numbers can be written as 11 times something else. So, let's think of a as 11 * m, and b as 11 * n, where m and n are integers, and GCF(m, n) is 1, because the GCF of a and b is 11, so m and n must be coprime.\n\nSo, a = 11 * m, b = 11 * n. Then, the LCM of a and b would be 11 * m * n, because LCM(a,b) = 11 * LCM(m, n). But since m and n are coprime, LCM(m, n) is m * n. So LCM(a,b) = 11 * m * n.\n\nSo, given that a is 350, which equals 11 * m. So 350 = 11 * m. But wait, 350 divided by 11 is approximately 31.818, which isn't an integer. So that can't be. So that suggests that either the problem has a mistake, or I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, this is conflicting. Because according to the problem, the GCF is 11, so both numbers should be multiples of 11. But 350 isn't a multiple of 11, so how can it be one of the numbers? So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is correct, and I'm making a mistake. Let me double-check. The problem states that the GCF is 11, and one of the numbers is 350. So 350 must be a multiple of 11. But 350 \u00f7 11 is 31.818..., which is not an integer. So that suggests that there's a mistake in the problem, but I'm probably missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the formula. Let me check the formula again. The formula is a * b = GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b). So in this case, 350 * b = 11 * 7700 = 84700. So b = 84700 / 350. Let me compute that again.\n\n350 divided into 84700: 350 * 242 = 84700. So b is 242. But as we saw earlier, 350 and 242 have a GCF of 2, not 11. So that's a problem. So that suggests that my initial approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me consider that the GCF is 11, so both numbers are multiples of 11. So let me write a = 11 * m and b = 11 * n, where m and n are coprime integers (their GCF is 1).\n\nThen, the LCM of a and b is 11 * m * n, because since m and n are coprime, their LCM is m*n. So LCM(a, b) = 11 * m * n.\n\nGiven that the LCM is 7700, so 11 * m * n = 7700. Dividing both sides by 11, m * n = 7700 / 11 = 700.\n\nSo m * n = 700, and since m and n are coprime, we need to find pairs (m, n) such that their product is 700 and GCF(m, n) is 1.\n\nBut one of the numbers a or b is 350. Since a is 11 * m, and one of them is 350, let's see which one it could be. So either 11*m = 350 or 11*n = 350.\n\nBut 350 divided by 11 is not an integer. So that's impossible. So that suggests that neither a nor b is 350. But the problem says one of them is 350. So I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is correct, but I've made a mistake in assuming that both a and b must be multiples of the GCF, which is 11. Because GCF(a, b) is 11, so both a and b must be multiples of 11. But 350 is not a multiple of 11. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps I've made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is incorrect. No, the formula a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b) is correct. Let me confirm that. Yes, I'm pretty sure that's correct. So if a is 350, and GCF(a, b) is 11, then 350 must be a multiple of 11, but it's not. So this is a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating 350 divided by 11. Let me check again. 11 times 31 is 341, 11*32=352. So 350 is between 341 and 352, so 350 is not divisible by 11. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. Oh! Wait a second, perhaps the formula is a * b = GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b). So in this case, 350 * b = 11 * 7700 = 84700.\n\nSo 350 * b = 84700. So b = 84700 / 350. Let me compute that again. 84700 divided by 350.\n\n350 * 242 is 84700. So b is 242. But as we saw earlier, 350 and 242 have a GCF of 2, not 11. So that's conflicting with the problem's statement.\n\nSo that suggests that either the problem is incorrect, or perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the GCF of 350 and 242.\n\nWait, let's recheck the GCF of 350 and 242.\n\n350: prime factors are 2, 5, 5, 7.\n\n242: 2, 11, 11.\n\nSo the common prime factors are just 2. So GCF is 2, not 11. So that can't be right. So that would imply that the correct other number can't be 242.\n\nSo that's a problem because according to the formula, that's the number we get, but it doesn't satisfy the GCF condition.\n\nSo perhaps I've made a mistake in the approach. Let me try to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should factor both numbers and see. Let me write the prime factors of 350 and the other number.\n\n350 = 2 * 5^2 * 7.\n\nLet me denote the other number as x. We know that GCF(350, x) is 11. So x must have 11 as a factor, but 350 doesn't. Wait, that can't be. Because if 350 doesn't have 11 as a factor, then the GCF can't be 11. Because GCF is the product of the smallest powers of the common prime factors. So if 350 doesn't have 11, then the GCF can't have 11. So that's impossible.\n\nWait, so this suggests that there's a mistake in the problem statement, perhaps. But that's not one of the options, so I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700. If one of the integers is 350, what is the other?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is correct, but I'm missing something. Let me think again. Maybe 350 is not a multiple of 11, but the GCF is 11 because the other number is a multiple of 11. But wait, the GCF is the largest number that divides both numbers. So if 350 isn't divisible by 11, the GCF can't be 11. So that's a contradiction.\n\nSo that suggests that the problem as stated is impossible. But since it's a multiple-choice question, I must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute using the formula, even if the numbers don't seem to fit. Let me compute b = 84700 / 350 = 242. So if the other number is 242, then let me check the GCF again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the prime factors. Let me compute GCD(350,242).\n\nLet me compute the GCD step by step.\n\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm:\n\nGCD(350, 242):\n\n350 divided by 242 is 1 with a remainder of 108 (350 = 242 * 1 + 108).\n\nNow compute GCD(242, 108).\n\n242 divided by 108 is 2 with a remainder of 26 (242 = 108 * 2 + 26).\n\nNow compute GCD(108, 26).\n\n108 \u00f7 26 = 4 *26 =104, remainder 4.\n\nSo GCD(26,4).\n\n26 \u00f74=6*4=24, remainder 2.\n\nGCD(4,2).\n\n4 \u00f72=2*2=4, remainder 0. So GCD is 2.\n\nSo the GCF is indeed 2, not 11. So that's conflicting with the problem's statement.\n\nSo this suggests that the initial approach is wrong, but I can't see where. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is correct, and I'm making a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the formula. The formula is correct, right? a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So if a is 350, and GCF is 11, then 350 must be a multiple of 11, which it's not. So this suggests that the problem is impossible as stated.\n\nBut since the problem is given, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem says that the GCF is 11, but one of the numbers is 350. So perhaps 350 is not a multiple of 11, but the other number is.\n\nWait, but then the GCF would have to be 1, because 350 and the other number (which is a multiple of 11) don't share any common factors besides 1. But the problem says the GCF is 11. So that's impossible.\n\nSo perhaps I should look for a mistake in the problem. But since it's a multiple-choice question, perhaps I should try each option to see which one fits.\n\nLet me list the options: A)242, B)308, C)352, D)412, E)456.\n\nI need to find which of these, when paired with 350, has a GCF of 11 and an LCM of 7700.\n\nLet me check each option.\n\nOption A: 242.\n\nAs before, GCF(350,242)=2. So no.\n\nOption B: 308.\n\nCompute GCF(350,308).\n\n350 factors: 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n308: Let's see, 308 \u00f7 2 =154. 154 \u00f72=77. 77 is 7*11.\n\nSo 308 = 2^2 *7 *11.\n\nSo common factors between 350 and 308: 2 and 7. So GCF is 2*7=14. But the problem says GCF is 11. So that's no good.\n\nOption C: 352.\n\n352: Let's factor it. 352 \u00f72=176, \u00f72=88, \u00f72=44, \u00f72=22, \u00f72=11. So 352=2^5 *11.\n\n350=2*5^2*7.\n\nCommon factors: 2. So GCF is 2. Not 11.\n\nOption D:412.\n\nFactor 412: 412 \u00f72=206. 206 \u00f72=103. 103 is a prime. So 412=2^2 *103.\n\n350=2*5^2*7.\n\nCommon factors: 2. So GCF is 2. Not 11.\n\nOption E:456.\n\nFactor 456: 456 \u00f72=228, \u00f72=114, \u00f72=57. 57=3*19. So 456=2^3 *3 *19.\n\n350=2*5^2 *7.\n\nCommon factors: 2. So GCF is 2.\n\nSo none of the options have a GCF of 11 with 350. So this is confusing. Because according to the problem, the GCF is 11, but none of the options satisfy that when paired with 350.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation for option B. Let me check 308 again.\n\n308: 2^2 *7 *11.\n\n350: 2 *5^2 *7.\n\nCommon factors: 2 and 7. So GCF is 2*7=14. But the problem says GCF is 11, so that's not correct.\n\nHmm. So none of the options when paired with 350 have a GCF of 11. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but since it's a test question, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think differently. Maybe the formula is a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So a=350, GCF=11, LCM=7700.\n\nSo 350 * b = 11 *7700 = 84700. So b=84700/350=242. But as we saw earlier, that gives GCF of 2. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem has a typo, and the GCF is 2, not 11. But the options are given, so perhaps the correct answer is 242, even though the GCF is 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the prime factors. Let me check 350 and 242 again.\n\n350: 2*5^2*7.\n\n242: 2*11^2.\n\nSo the only common factor is 2, so GCF is 2. So the answer can't be 242 because the GCF is 2, not 11.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is wrong. But since I have to choose from the options, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is incorrect. No, the formula is correct. So I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try using the formula but considering that the GCF is 11. So, let me write a =11 * m, b=11 *n, where m and n are coprime.\n\nThen, LCM(a, b)=11 * m * n. So 11 * m * n =7700 \u2192 m *n =700.\n\nAlso, one of the numbers is 350. So either a=11m=350 \u2192 m=350/11 \u224831.818, which isn't an integer. Or b=11n=350 \u2192n=350/11\u224831.818, not integer. So that's impossible. So that suggests that the problem is impossible as stated.\n\nBut the problem gives options, so perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 2, not 11.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a number x such that when paired with 350, GCF is 11 and LCM is 7700.\n\nLet me think: For the GCF to be 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11, which it's not. So that's impossible.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm miscalculating 350. Let me check 350 \u00f711 again.\n\n11 \u00d7 31 = 341. 350-341=9. So 350 \u00f711 is 31 with remainder 9. So it's not a multiple. So that's a problem.\n\nSo the only possible conclusion is that the problem is incorrect. But since it's a multiple-choice question, perhaps I should look for the option that, when multiplied by 350, gives 84700 and also has a GCF of 11. But as we've seen, that's not possible because 350 isn't a multiple of 11.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the possible other number as 84700 /350=242, even though the GCF is 2. But the problem states that the GCF is 11, which doesn't match. So perhaps the correct answer is not present, but the options are given, so perhaps I should pick the one that fits the formula, even if the GCF doesn't match.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of GCF(350,242).\n\nWait, let me compute GCF(350,242) again using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nCompute GCF(350, 242):\n\n350 \u00f7242 = 1, remainder 108.\n\nNow GCF(242,108).\n\n242 \u00f7108 =2, remainder 26.\n\nNow GCF(108,26).\n\n108 \u00f726=4, remainder 4.\n\nNow GCF(26,4).\n\n26 \u00f74=6, remainder 2.\n\nGCF(4,2)=2.\n\nSo yes, GCF is 2. So that's correct.\n\nSo the only possible conclusion is that the problem has an error, but since I have to choose from the options, perhaps the intended answer is 242, despite the GCF being 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute LCM(350,242) and see if it's 7700.\n\nCompute LCM(350,242).\n\nSince 350=2 *5^2 *7, and 242=2 *11^2.\n\nThe LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes present. So:\n\nPrimes: 2,5,7,11.\n\nHighest exponents: 2^1,5^2,7^1,11^2.\n\nSo LCM=2*25*7*121.\n\nCompute that: 2*25=50, 50*7=350, 350*121=42350.\n\nBut the problem states that LCM is 7700. So 42350\u22607700. So that's another problem.\n\nSo that suggests that 242 is not the correct answer.\n\nWait, so the problem is impossible as stated. But since the options are given, perhaps I should choose the option that gives the product 84700 when multiplied by 350. But none of the options seem to fit.\n\nWait, let me compute 350 multiplied by each option:\n\nOption A:350*242=84700 \u2192 which matches the product, but as we saw, the GCF is 2, not 11.\n\nOption B:350*308=107800. Which is 11*7700=84700? No, 11*7700=84700, so this is larger.\n\nOption C:350*352=123200.\n\nOption D:350*412=144200.\n\nOption E:350*456=160, 350*456=160, wait, 350 *456 = let me compute.\n\n350 *456: 350*400=140000, 350*56=19600. So total 140000+19600=159600.\n\nSo only option A gives the correct product of 84700, but the GCF is wrong. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but the intended answer is A)242.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think again: The product of the two numbers equals the product of their GCF and LCM. So a * b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b).\n\nSo 350 * x = 11 *7700 = 84700 \u2192 x=242.\n\nBut as we saw, the GCF is 2, which contradicts the problem's statement. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but among the options, 242 is the only one that fits the product, so perhaps the answer is A)242.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the GCF isn't 11. So perhaps the problem intended the LCM to be 42350, which would be the case if the other number is 242. But the problem states the LCM is 7700.\n\nThis is getting really confusing. I think I've hit a dead end here. Maybe I should go with the answer that fits the product, even if the GCF doesn't match, because perhaps I made a mistake in the GCF calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the GCF of 350 and 242 again. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\n350: 2 * 5^2 *7.\n\n242: 2 * 11^2.\n\nThe common prime is 2, so GCF is 2. That's correct.\n\nSo, the only possible conclusion is that the problem is incorrect, but the intended answer is A)242.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves finding the other integer when one of the integers is 350, the greatest common factor (GCF) is 11, and the least common multiple (LCM) is 7700. The relationship between GCF and LCM is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\na \\times b = \\text{GCF}(a, b) \\times \\text{LCM}(a, b)\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(a = 350\\), \\(\\text{GCF}(a, b) = 11\\), and \\(\\text{LCM}(a, b) = 7700\\). Substituting these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n350 \\times b = 11 \\times 7700\n\\]\n\nCalculating the right-hand side:\n\n\\[\n11 \\times 7700 = 84700\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\n350 \\times b = 84700 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b = \\frac{84700}{350} = 242\n\\]\n\nThe other integer is \\(b = 242\\). However, there is a contradiction: the GCF of 350 and 242 is not 11. Breaking down the prime factors:\n\n- \\(350 = 2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7\\)\n- \\(242 = 2 \\times 11^2\\)\n\nThe only common prime factor is \\(2\\), so \\(\\text{GCF}(350, 242) = 2\\), not 11. This contradicts the problem's statement that the GCF is 11. \n\nTo resolve this, the problem may contain an error, but based on the formula, the only value of \\(b\\) that satisfies \\(350 \\times b = 84700\\) is \\(242\\). Among the options provided, \\(242\\) is the only one that fits the product condition, even though it does not satisfy the GCF condition.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n**Answer: A**",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with GCF and LCM problems, but I'll give it a shot. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe problem says: The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700. One of the integers is 350, and we need to find the other one. The options are A) 242, B) 308, C) 352, D)412, E)456.\n\nHmm, I remember there's a relationship between GCF and LCM of two numbers. Oh right! The product of the two numbers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM. So, if I denote the two numbers as a and b, then a * b = GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b). That's the formula I need to use here.\n\nWait, so let's write that down. Let me assign a = 350, and b is the unknown we're trying to find. The GCF is 11, and the LCM is 7700. So according to the formula, 350 * b = 11 * 7700.\n\nLet me compute the right side first. 11 multiplied by 7700. Hmm, 7700 divided by 11 is 700, so 11*7700 would be 7700 * 11. Let me calculate that: 7700 * 10 is 77000, plus 7700 is 84700. So the product a*b is 84700.\n\nSo, 350 * b = 84700. To find b, I can divide both sides by 350. So b = 84700 / 350.\n\nLet me compute that. Let's see, 84700 divided by 350. Hmm, maybe I can simplify this division. Let's see, both numerator and denominator can be divided by 10 first. So that becomes 8470 / 35.\n\nWait, 35 times 242 is 8470 because 35 times 240 is 8400, and 35*2=70, so 8400+70=8470. So 8470 divided by 35 is 242. So b is 242. But wait, let me double-check that calculation because sometimes I make mistakes in arithmetic.\n\nWait, 35 * 242. Let me compute that. 35 times 200 is 7000, 35 times 40 is 1400, 35 times 2 is 70. Adding them together: 7000 + 1400 is 8400, plus 70 is 8470. Oh yeah, that's correct. So 35 * 242 = 8470, so 84700 / 350 is indeed 242.\n\nSo the other number is 242. Let me check the options. Option A is 242. So that's the answer? But wait, I should make sure that 242 and 350 indeed have a GCF of 11 and an LCM of 7700.\n\nLet me verify the GCF first. The GCF of 350 and 242.\n\nBreaking down 350 into prime factors: 350 = 2 * 5^2 * 7. Wait, 2 * 5 *5 *7.\n\n242: Let's see, 242 divided by 2 is 121, which is 11 squared. So 242 = 2 * 11^2.\n\nSo the common factors between 350 and 242: both have a 2. So the GCF is 2. Wait a minute, that's a problem. Because the problem states that the GCF is 11, but according to this, it's 2. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because I thought the formula was a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). Did I apply it correctly?\n\nWait, let me recheck. So a = 350, b = 242. GCF is 2, as per their prime factors. So 350 * 242 = (2) * (7700) ?\n\nWait, 350 * 242 is 84700. The product of GCF and LCM would be 2 * 7700 = 15400, which is way less than 84700. So that's not possible. So that means I must have made a mistake in my initial approach.\n\nWait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me go back to the problem. The GCF is 11. So both numbers must be multiples of 11. But 350 is 35 * 10, which is 5*7 * 2*5. So 350 is 2 * 5^2 * 7. Hmm, that doesn't have 11 as a factor. So that's a problem. Because the GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11.\n\nWait a second, that's a mistake. If the GCF is 11, then both numbers must be divisible by 11. But 350 is 350 divided by 11? Let me check: 11*31 is 341, 11*32 is 352. So 350 divided by 11 is 31.81..., which is not an integer. So 350 is not divisible by 11. That's a problem because the GCF is 11. So that would imply that both numbers must be multiples of 11.\n\nWait, but the problem says one of the numbers is 350. But 350 isn't a multiple of 11, which contradicts the GCF being 11. So perhaps I've made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, maybe I misapplied the formula. Let me think again. The formula is a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So if GCF is 11, then 350 * b = 11 * 7700.\n\nWait, but if 350 isn't a multiple of 11, then b must be a multiple of 11, but when you multiply 350 and b, which is a multiple of 11, then 350*b must be a multiple of 11, which it is because 11*7700 is 84700, which is 11 times something.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is that I'm not considering that the numbers can be written as 11 times something else. So, let's think of a as 11 * m, and b as 11 * n, where m and n are integers, and GCF(m, n) is 1, because the GCF of a and b is 11, so m and n must be coprime.\n\nSo, a = 11 * m, b = 11 * n. Then, the LCM of a and b would be 11 * m * n, because LCM(a,b) = 11 * LCM(m, n). But since m and n are coprime, LCM(m, n) is m * n. So LCM(a,b) = 11 * m * n.\n\nSo, given that a is 350, which equals 11 * m. So 350 = 11 * m. But wait, 350 divided by 11 is approximately 31.818, which isn't an integer. So that can't be. So that suggests that either the problem has a mistake, or I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, this is conflicting. Because according to the problem, the GCF is 11, so both numbers should be multiples of 11. But 350 isn't a multiple of 11, so how can it be one of the numbers? So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is correct, and I'm making a mistake. Let me double-check. The problem states that the GCF is 11, and one of the numbers is 350. So 350 must be a multiple of 11. But 350 \u00f7 11 is 31.818..., which is not an integer. So that suggests that there's a mistake in the problem, but I'm probably missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the formula. Let me check the formula again. The formula is a * b = GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b). So in this case, 350 * b = 11 * 7700 = 84700. So b = 84700 / 350. Let me compute that again.\n\n350 divided into 84700: 350 * 242 = 84700. So b is 242. But as we saw earlier, 350 and 242 have a GCF of 2, not 11. So that's a problem. So that suggests that my initial approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me consider that the GCF is 11, so both numbers are multiples of 11. So let me write a = 11 * m and b = 11 * n, where m and n are coprime integers (their GCF is 1).\n\nThen, the LCM of a and b is 11 * m * n, because since m and n are coprime, their LCM is m*n. So LCM(a, b) = 11 * m * n.\n\nGiven that the LCM is 7700, so 11 * m * n = 7700. Dividing both sides by 11, m * n = 7700 / 11 = 700.\n\nSo m * n = 700, and since m and n are coprime, we need to find pairs (m, n) such that their product is 700 and GCF(m, n) is 1.\n\nBut one of the numbers a or b is 350. Since a is 11 * m, and one of them is 350, let's see which one it could be. So either 11*m = 350 or 11*n = 350.\n\nBut 350 divided by 11 is not an integer. So that's impossible. So that suggests that neither a nor b is 350. But the problem says one of them is 350. So I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is correct, but I've made a mistake in assuming that both a and b must be multiples of the GCF, which is 11. Because GCF(a, b) is 11, so both a and b must be multiples of 11. But 350 is not a multiple of 11. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps I've made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is incorrect. No, the formula a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b) is correct. Let me confirm that. Yes, I'm pretty sure that's correct. So if a is 350, and GCF(a, b) is 11, then 350 must be a multiple of 11, but it's not. So this is a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating 350 divided by 11. Let me check again. 11 times 31 is 341, 11*32=352. So 350 is between 341 and 352, so 350 is not divisible by 11. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. Oh! Wait a second, perhaps the formula is a * b = GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b). So in this case, 350 * b = 11 * 7700 = 84700.\n\nSo 350 * b = 84700. So b = 84700 / 350. Let me compute that again. 84700 divided by 350.\n\n350 * 242 is 84700. So b is 242. But as we saw earlier, 350 and 242 have a GCF of 2, not 11. So that's conflicting with the problem's statement.\n\nSo that suggests that either the problem is incorrect, or perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the GCF of 350 and 242.\n\nWait, let's recheck the GCF of 350 and 242.\n\n350: prime factors are 2, 5, 5, 7.\n\n242: 2, 11, 11.\n\nSo the common prime factors are just 2. So GCF is 2, not 11. So that can't be right. So that would imply that the correct other number can't be 242.\n\nSo that's a problem because according to the formula, that's the number we get, but it doesn't satisfy the GCF condition.\n\nSo perhaps I've made a mistake in the approach. Let me try to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should factor both numbers and see. Let me write the prime factors of 350 and the other number.\n\n350 = 2 * 5^2 * 7.\n\nLet me denote the other number as x. We know that GCF(350, x) is 11. So x must have 11 as a factor, but 350 doesn't. Wait, that can't be. Because if 350 doesn't have 11 as a factor, then the GCF can't be 11. Because GCF is the product of the smallest powers of the common prime factors. So if 350 doesn't have 11, then the GCF can't have 11. So that's impossible.\n\nWait, so this suggests that there's a mistake in the problem statement, perhaps. But that's not one of the options, so I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700. If one of the integers is 350, what is the other?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is correct, but I'm missing something. Let me think again. Maybe 350 is not a multiple of 11, but the GCF is 11 because the other number is a multiple of 11. But wait, the GCF is the largest number that divides both numbers. So if 350 isn't divisible by 11, the GCF can't be 11. So that's a contradiction.\n\nSo that suggests that the problem as stated is impossible. But since it's a multiple-choice question, I must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute using the formula, even if the numbers don't seem to fit. Let me compute b = 84700 / 350 = 242. So if the other number is 242, then let me check the GCF again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the prime factors. Let me compute GCD(350,242).\n\nLet me compute the GCD step by step.\n\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm:\n\nGCD(350, 242):\n\n350 divided by 242 is 1 with a remainder of 108 (350 = 242 * 1 + 108).\n\nNow compute GCD(242, 108).\n\n242 divided by 108 is 2 with a remainder of 26 (242 = 108 * 2 + 26).\n\nNow compute GCD(108, 26).\n\n108 \u00f7 26 = 4 *26 =104, remainder 4.\n\nSo GCD(26,4).\n\n26 \u00f74=6*4=24, remainder 2.\n\nGCD(4,2).\n\n4 \u00f72=2*2=4, remainder 0. So GCD is 2.\n\nSo the GCF is indeed 2, not 11. So that's conflicting with the problem's statement.\n\nSo this suggests that the initial approach is wrong, but I can't see where. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is correct, and I'm making a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the formula. The formula is correct, right? a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So if a is 350, and GCF is 11, then 350 must be a multiple of 11, which it's not. So this suggests that the problem is impossible as stated.\n\nBut since the problem is given, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem says that the GCF is 11, but one of the numbers is 350. So perhaps 350 is not a multiple of 11, but the other number is.\n\nWait, but then the GCF would have to be 1, because 350 and the other number (which is a multiple of 11) don't share any common factors besides 1. But the problem says the GCF is 11. So that's impossible.\n\nSo perhaps I should look for a mistake in the problem. But since it's a multiple-choice question, perhaps I should try each option to see which one fits.\n\nLet me list the options: A)242, B)308, C)352, D)412, E)456.\n\nI need to find which of these, when paired with 350, has a GCF of 11 and an LCM of 7700.\n\nLet me check each option.\n\nOption A: 242.\n\nAs before, GCF(350,242)=2. So no.\n\nOption B: 308.\n\nCompute GCF(350,308).\n\n350 factors: 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n308: Let's see, 308 \u00f7 2 =154. 154 \u00f72=77. 77 is 7*11.\n\nSo 308 = 2^2 *7 *11.\n\nSo common factors between 350 and 308: 2 and 7. So GCF is 2*7=14. But the problem says GCF is 11. So that's no good.\n\nOption C: 352.\n\n352: Let's factor it. 352 \u00f72=176, \u00f72=88, \u00f72=44, \u00f72=22, \u00f72=11. So 352=2^5 *11.\n\n350=2*5^2*7.\n\nCommon factors: 2. So GCF is 2. Not 11.\n\nOption D:412.\n\nFactor 412: 412 \u00f72=206. 206 \u00f72=103. 103 is a prime. So 412=2^2 *103.\n\n350=2*5^2*7.\n\nCommon factors: 2. So GCF is 2. Not 11.\n\nOption E:456.\n\nFactor 456: 456 \u00f72=228, \u00f72=114, \u00f72=57. 57=3*19. So 456=2^3 *3 *19.\n\n350=2*5^2 *7.\n\nCommon factors: 2. So GCF is 2.\n\nSo none of the options have a GCF of 11 with 350. So this is confusing. Because according to the problem, the GCF is 11, but none of the options satisfy that when paired with 350.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation for option B. Let me check 308 again.\n\n308: 2^2 *7 *11.\n\n350: 2 *5^2 *7.\n\nCommon factors: 2 and 7. So GCF is 2*7=14. But the problem says GCF is 11, so that's not correct.\n\nHmm. So none of the options when paired with 350 have a GCF of 11. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but since it's a test question, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think differently. Maybe the formula is a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So a=350, GCF=11, LCM=7700.\n\nSo 350 * b = 11 *7700 = 84700. So b=84700/350=242. But as we saw earlier, that gives GCF of 2. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem has a typo, and the GCF is 2, not 11. But the options are given, so perhaps the correct answer is 242, even though the GCF is 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the prime factors. Let me check 350 and 242 again.\n\n350: 2*5^2*7.\n\n242: 2*11^2.\n\nSo the only common factor is 2, so GCF is 2. So the answer can't be 242 because the GCF is 2, not 11.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is wrong. But since I have to choose from the options, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is incorrect. No, the formula is correct. So I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try using the formula but considering that the GCF is 11. So, let me write a =11 * m, b=11 *n, where m and n are coprime.\n\nThen, LCM(a, b)=11 * m * n. So 11 * m * n =7700 \u2192 m *n =700.\n\nAlso, one of the numbers is 350. So either a=11m=350 \u2192 m=350/11 \u224831.818, which isn't an integer. Or b=11n=350 \u2192n=350/11\u224831.818, not integer. So that's impossible. So that suggests that the problem is impossible as stated.\n\nBut the problem gives options, so perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 2, not 11.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a number x such that when paired with 350, GCF is 11 and LCM is 7700.\n\nLet me think: For the GCF to be 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11, which it's not. So that's impossible.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm miscalculating 350. Let me check 350 \u00f711 again.\n\n11 \u00d7 31 = 341. 350-341=9. So 350 \u00f711 is 31 with remainder 9. So it's not a multiple. So that's a problem.\n\nSo the only possible conclusion is that the problem is incorrect. But since it's a multiple-choice question, perhaps I should look for the option that, when multiplied by 350, gives 84700 and also has a GCF of 11. But as we've seen, that's not possible because 350 isn't a multiple of 11.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the possible other number as 84700 /350=242, even though the GCF is 2. But the problem states that the GCF is 11, which doesn't match. So perhaps the correct answer is not present, but the options are given, so perhaps I should pick the one that fits the formula, even if the GCF doesn't match.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of GCF(350,242).\n\nWait, let me compute GCF(350,242) again using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nCompute GCF(350, 242):\n\n350 \u00f7242 = 1, remainder 108.\n\nNow GCF(242,108).\n\n242 \u00f7108 =2, remainder 26.\n\nNow GCF(108,26).\n\n108 \u00f726=4, remainder 4.\n\nNow GCF(26,4).\n\n26 \u00f74=6, remainder 2.\n\nGCF(4,2)=2.\n\nSo yes, GCF is 2. So that's correct.\n\nSo the only possible conclusion is that the problem has an error, but since I have to choose from the options, perhaps the intended answer is 242, despite the GCF being 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute LCM(350,242) and see if it's 7700.\n\nCompute LCM(350,242).\n\nSince 350=2 *5^2 *7, and 242=2 *11^2.\n\nThe LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes present. So:\n\nPrimes: 2,5,7,11.\n\nHighest exponents: 2^1,5^2,7^1,11^2.\n\nSo LCM=2*25*7*121.\n\nCompute that: 2*25=50, 50*7=350, 350*121=42350.\n\nBut the problem states that LCM is 7700. So 42350\u22607700. So that's another problem.\n\nSo that suggests that 242 is not the correct answer.\n\nWait, so the problem is impossible as stated. But since the options are given, perhaps I should choose the option that gives the product 84700 when multiplied by 350. But none of the options seem to fit.\n\nWait, let me compute 350 multiplied by each option:\n\nOption A:350*242=84700 \u2192 which matches the product, but as we saw, the GCF is 2, not 11.\n\nOption B:350*308=107800. Which is 11*7700=84700? No, 11*7700=84700, so this is larger.\n\nOption C:350*352=123200.\n\nOption D:350*412=144200.\n\nOption E:350*456=160, 350*456=160, wait, 350 *456 = let me compute.\n\n350 *456: 350*400=140000, 350*56=19600. So total 140000+19600=159600.\n\nSo only option A gives the correct product of 84700, but the GCF is wrong. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but the intended answer is A)242.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think again: The product of the two numbers equals the product of their GCF and LCM. So a * b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b).\n\nSo 350 * x = 11 *7700 = 84700 \u2192 x=242.\n\nBut as we saw, the GCF is 2, which contradicts the problem's statement. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but among the options, 242 is the only one that fits the product, so perhaps the answer is A)242.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the GCF isn't 11. So perhaps the problem intended the LCM to be 42350, which would be the case if the other number is 242. But the problem states the LCM is 7700.\n\nThis is getting really confusing. I think I've hit a dead end here. Maybe I should go with the answer that fits the product, even if the GCF doesn't match, because perhaps I made a mistake in the GCF calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the GCF of 350 and 242 again. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\n350: 2 * 5^2 *7.\n\n242: 2 * 11^2.\n\nThe common prime is 2, so GCF is 2. That's correct.\n\nSo, the only possible conclusion is that the problem is incorrect, but the intended answer is A)242.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the other integer when one of the integers is 350, the greatest common factor (GCF) is 11, and the least common multiple (LCM) is 7700. The relationship between GCF and LCM is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\na \\times b = \\text{GCF}(a, b) \\times \\text{LCM}(a, b)\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(a = 350\\), \\(\\text{GCF}(a, b) = 11\\), and \\(\\text{LCM}(a, b) = 7700\\). Substituting these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n350 \\times b = 11 \\times 7700\n\\]\n\nCalculating the right-hand side:\n\n\\[\n11 \\times 7700 = 84700\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\n350 \\times b = 84700 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b = \\frac{84700}{350} = 242\n\\]\n\nThe other integer is \\(b = 242\\). However, there is a contradiction: the GCF of 350 and 242 is not 11. Breaking down the prime factors:\n\n- \\(350 = 2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7\\)\n- \\(242 = 2 \\times 11^2\\)\n\nThe only common prime factor is \\(2\\), so \\(\\text{GCF}(350, 242) = 2\\), not 11. This contradicts the problem's statement that the GCF is 11. \n\nTo resolve this, the problem may contain an error, but based on the formula, the only value of \\(b\\) that satisfies \\(350 \\times b = 84700\\) is \\(242\\). Among the options provided, \\(242\\) is the only one that fits the product condition, even though it does not satisfy the GCF condition.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n**Answer: A**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about the greatest common factor and the least common multiple of two numbers. Oh right, I remember that GCF and LCM have some relationship with the numbers.\n\nThe problem says the greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11. Oh, and the least common multiple (LCM) is 7700. One of the integers is 350, and I need to find the other. The options are given, so maybe I can use that to check my answer once I work it out.\n\nWait, I think there's a formula that connects GCF and LCM with the two numbers. Let me recall. Oh right, for any two positive integers a and b, the product of their GCF and LCM is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. So, GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b. Yeah, that sounds right.\n\nSo in this case, GCF is 11, LCM is 7700. So 11 * 7700 = a * b. Let me calculate that. 11 multiplied by 7700. Let's see, 11*7000 is 77000, and 11*700 is 7700, wait no, wait. Wait, 7700 is the same as 700 * 11, but I'm getting confused. Wait, 11 * 7700: 7700 * 10 is 77000, plus 7700 is 84700. So 11 * 7700 is 84700. So a*b = 84700.\n\nWe know one of the numbers, a, is 350. So 350 * b = 84700. To find b, I can divide 84700 by 350.\n\nLet me compute that. 350 goes into 84700 how many times? Let's see, 350 times 200 is 70000. 84700 minus 70000 is 14700. 350 times 40 is 14000. So 14700 minus 14000 is 700. 350 times 2 is 700. So total is 200 +40 +2 = 242. So b is 242.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure that 242 is the correct answer. Because I remember that the GCF has to be a factor of both numbers. So the GCF is 11, so both numbers must be multiples of 11. Let me check if 350 is a multiple of 11.\n\n350 divided by 11: 11*31 is 341, 350-341=9. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. Oh wait, that's a problem because the GCF is 11. If the GCF is 11, both numbers must be divisible by 11. But 350 is not. So that can't be right. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. If the GCF is 11, then both numbers must have 11 as a factor. So 350 must be a multiple of 11? But 350 divided by 11 is 31.818..., which isn't an integer. So that's a contradiction. So maybe I did something wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated the product a*b. Let me recheck. GCF is 11, LCM is 7700. So 11 * 7700 equals 84700. So a*b is 84700. If a is 350, then b is 84700 / 350.\n\nLet me calculate that division again. 84700 divided by 350.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can simplify the division. 350 is 35 * 10. So 84700 divided by 350 is same as 84700/(35*10) = (84700/35)/10.\n\nWhat's 84700 divided by 35? Let's compute that. 35 times 2400 is 84000. 84700 - 84000 = 700. 35 * 20 is 700. So total is 2400 +20 = 2420. So 84700/35 is 2420. Then divide by 10 gives 242.\n\nSo that's the same result as before. So b is 242. But wait, 242 is a multiple of 11 because 242 / 11 is 22, which is an integer. So 242 is divisible by 11. But 350 is not. That's a problem because the GCF is 11, meaning both numbers must be divisible by 11. So how can 350 be one of the numbers?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me reread it. The problem says that the GCF of two numbers is 11, and one of the numbers is 350. Oh wait, that can't be possible because if the GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11. So if one is 350, which is not a multiple of 11, that can't be. So there's a contradiction here.\n\nWait, so that suggests that either I made a mistake in my calculation, or perhaps the problem is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I'm wrong about the formula. Let me double-check the formula. The formula is GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a*b. Yes, that's correct. So 11 *7700= 84700. So if a is 350, then b is 84700/350=242.\n\nBut then, the problem arises because 350 isn't a multiple of 11. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, or maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the GCF is not 11, but that's not what the problem says.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reevaluate. Maybe 350 is a multiple of 11. Let me check 350 divided by 11 again. 11 *31=341, 350-341=9. So 350 is 31*11 +9. So the remainder is 9, so no, 350 is not a multiple of 11. So that can't be. So how can the GCF be 11 if one of the numbers isn't a multiple of 11?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think differently. Let's suppose that the two numbers are a and b. GCF(a, b) is 11. So a =11 * m, b=11 *n, where m and n are integers, and their GCF is 1 (because if m and n had a common factor, then the GCF of a and b would be higher than 11).\n\nSo, a=11m, b=11n, and GCF(m, n)=1.\n\nNow, the LCM of a and b is 7700. The LCM of two numbers a and b is equal to (a*b)/GCF(a,b). But since a=11m and b=11n, then LCM(a,b)= (11m *11n)/11= 11 m n.\n\nSo 11 m n =7700. So m n =7700 /11 = 700.\n\nSo m*n=700. Now, since m and n are coprime (their GCF is 1), we can find pairs (m, n) where m and n are coprime and their product is 700.\n\nWe know that a is 350, so let's see. a=11m =350. So m=350/11. But 350 divided by 11 is 31.818..., which isn't an integer. So that's impossible. So that suggests that a=350 can't be one of the numbers when the GCF is 11. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is correct, and I'm making a mistake. Let me try again. Let's say a is 350, and the GCF of a and b is 11. Then 11 must divide both a and b. So 11 must divide 350. But 350/11 is not an integer. So that's impossible. So the problem must have a typo, or perhaps I misread it.\n\nWait, maybe the problem says that the GCF is 11, and one of the numbers is 350, but that's impossible. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's not one of the choices. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the answer options. The options are 242, 308, 352, 412, 456.\n\nWait, let's check each option to see which one, when paired with 350, gives GCF 11 and LCM 7700.\n\nLet me pick option A:242.\n\nCompute GCF of 350 and 242.\n\nFirst, factor both numbers.\n\n350: factors are 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242: 2 *11^2.\n\nSo the common factors are 2. So GCF is 2, not 11. So option A is incorrect.\n\nOption B:308.\n\n308: factors? Let's see. 308 divided by 2 is 154. 154 divided by 2 is 77. 77 is 7*11. So 308 =2^2 *7 *11.\n\n350 is 2 *5^2 *7.\n\nCommon factors: 2 and 7. So GCF is 2*7=14. Not 11. So option B is wrong.\n\nOption C:352.\n\n352: let's factor. 352 /2=176, /2=88, /2=44, /2=22, /2=11. So 352=2^5 *11.\n\n350 is 2 *5^2 *7. So common factors are 2. GCF is 2. Not 11. So option C is wrong.\n\nOption D:412.\n\n412: Let's factor. 412 divided by 2 is 206, again divided by 2 is 103. 103 is a prime. So 412=2^2 *103.\n\n350 is 2 *5^2 *7. So common factor is 2. GCF is 2. Not 11. So D is wrong.\n\nOption E:456.\n\n456: 456 divided by 2 is 228, divided by 2 is 114, divided by 2 is 57. 57 is 3*19. So 456=2^3 *3 *19.\n\n350 is 2 *5^2 *7. Common factor is 2. So GCF is 2. Not 11. So E is wrong.\n\nWait, but none of the options give a GCF of 11 when paired with 350. So that suggests that perhaps the correct answer isn't in the options, but that's impossible because the problem says one of them is 350.\n\nWait, but earlier I found that the other number would be 242, but that gives a GCF of 2, not 11. So that suggests that the initial approach was wrong.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me re-examine the formula. GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a*b. So if a is 350, and GCF is 11, LCM is 7700.\n\nSo 11 *7700= a*b=350*b.\n\nSo 84700 =350*b \u2192 b=84700/350=242.\n\nBut when I check the GCF of 350 and 242, it's 2, not 11. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, that suggests that the initial assumption is wrong. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the LCM is 7700, which is 700*11. Wait, 7700 is 700 * 11. Hmm, 700 is 7*100=7*(2^2 *5^2).\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe the formula is correct, but the problem is set in a way that one of the numbers is not a multiple of the GCF. Which can't be because the GCF must divide both numbers.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is wrong, but let's see the options again. None of the options when paired with 350 give a GCF of 11.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reevaluate my initial approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is correct, and the other number is 242, but the GCF is 11, but my calculation of GCF is wrong.\n\nWait, 350 is 2 * 5^2 *7.\n\n242 is 2 *11^2.\n\nSo the common factors are 2. So GCF is 2. So the problem statement must have a mistake because it says the GCF is 11.\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but the problem expects us to choose 242, which is option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says the GCF is 11, LCM is 7700, one number is 350. So the other number is 242, but that gives GCF of 2, which contradicts the problem's GCF of 11.\n\nSo perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is not applicable here. No, the formula is correct. So I'm stuck because according to the formula, the other number should be 242, but that doesn't satisfy the GCF condition.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the problem differently. Maybe I should factor both numbers into primes and see.\n\nWe know that a=350 and b=242.\n\n350=2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242=2 *11^2.\n\nSo the GCF is the product of the minimum exponents of shared primes. So the shared prime is 2. So GCF is 2^1=2.\n\nBut the problem states the GCF is 11. So this suggests that 11 must be a shared prime factor, but 350 doesn't have 11 as a factor.\n\nSo the only conclusion is that the problem is incorrect, but since the options are given, perhaps I should choose the answer that fits the formula, even if it doesn't fit the GCF condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended that the other number is 242, but that would mean the GCF is 2, which contradicts the given condition.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 350 *242.\n\nWait, 350 *242: 350*200=70000, 350*40=14000, 350*2=700. So 70000+14000=84000, +700=84700. So 350*242=84700. And 11*7700=84700, so that part checks out. But the GCF is 2, not 11.\n\nSo the only conclusion is that there's a mistake in the problem statement, perhaps the LCM is different, or the GCF is different.\n\nBut given the options, the correct answer according to the formula is 242, which is option A. So perhaps the problem intended for that, but the GCF condition is a red herring. Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another approach. Let me think about the prime factors.\n\nSince the GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11, but it's not. So perhaps the problem intended that 350 is a multiple of 11, but it's not. So perhaps the problem has a typo, and the intended number is 385, which is 35*11, but that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is correct, and the other number is 242, which is 11*22, but 350 is not a multiple of 11, which is a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the GCF of 350 and 242 again, but I think I did that right. 350 and 242 both have 2 as a factor, but no higher. So the GCF is 2.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. But according to the formula, the answer is 242, which is option A. So perhaps the problem expects that, even though it doesn't satisfy the GCF condition. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, another thought. If the GCF is 11, then both numbers must be multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11. Let me check 350/11 again.\n\n11*31 is 341. 350-341=9. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. Therefore, it's impossible for the GCF to be 11 if one of the numbers is 350. So the problem must be incorrect. But since the options are given, perhaps I should proceed.\n\nWait, but the problem gives options, and the only number that comes out of the formula is 242, which is option A. So perhaps the problem expects that, despite the GCF not being 11. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 2, but that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the product.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's let the two numbers be 11a and 11b, where a and b are coprime. Then their LCM is 11ab. So 11ab=7700 \u2192 ab=700.\n\nWe know one of the numbers is 350. So either 11a=350 or 11b=350.\n\nCase 1: 11a=350 \u2192 a=350/11 \u224831.818, which is not integer. So impossible.\n\nCase 2: 11b=350 \u2192 same issue. So impossible.\n\nSo neither a nor b can be integers in this scenario. So the problem as stated is impossible because 350 is not a multiple of 11.\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but the closest is 242, which is option A. But in reality, the problem is flawed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should choose the option that gives the correct product, even if the GCF is wrong.\n\nSo the correct answer according to the formula is 242, which is option A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves finding the other integer when one integer is 350, the greatest common factor (GCF) is 11, and the least common multiple (LCM) is 7700.

Despite the contradiction in the GCF condition, the problem likely expects this answer.\n\nAnswer: A",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about the greatest common factor and the least common multiple of two numbers. Oh right, I remember that GCF and LCM have some relationship with the numbers.\n\nThe problem says the greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11. Oh, and the least common multiple (LCM) is 7700. One of the integers is 350, and I need to find the other. The options are given, so maybe I can use that to check my answer once I work it out.\n\nWait, I think there's a formula that connects GCF and LCM with the two numbers. Let me recall. Oh right, for any two positive integers a and b, the product of their GCF and LCM is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. So, GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b. Yeah, that sounds right.\n\nSo in this case, GCF is 11, LCM is 7700. So 11 * 7700 = a * b. Let me calculate that. 11 multiplied by 7700. Let's see, 11*7000 is 77000, and 11*700 is 7700, wait no, wait. Wait, 7700 is the same as 700 * 11, but I'm getting confused. Wait, 11 * 7700: 7700 * 10 is 77000, plus 7700 is 84700. So 11 * 7700 is 84700. So a*b = 84700.\n\nWe know one of the numbers, a, is 350. So 350 * b = 84700. To find b, I can divide 84700 by 350.\n\nLet me compute that. 350 goes into 84700 how many times? Let's see, 350 times 200 is 70000. 84700 minus 70000 is 14700. 350 times 40 is 14000. So 14700 minus 14000 is 700. 350 times 2 is 700. So total is 200 +40 +2 = 242. So b is 242.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure that 242 is the correct answer. Because I remember that the GCF has to be a factor of both numbers. So the GCF is 11, so both numbers must be multiples of 11. Let me check if 350 is a multiple of 11.\n\n350 divided by 11: 11*31 is 341, 350-341=9. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. Oh wait, that's a problem because the GCF is 11. If the GCF is 11, both numbers must be divisible by 11. But 350 is not. So that can't be right. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. If the GCF is 11, then both numbers must have 11 as a factor. So 350 must be a multiple of 11? But 350 divided by 11 is 31.818..., which isn't an integer. So that's a contradiction. So maybe I did something wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated the product a*b. Let me recheck. GCF is 11, LCM is 7700. So 11 * 7700 equals 84700. So a*b is 84700. If a is 350, then b is 84700 / 350.\n\nLet me calculate that division again. 84700 divided by 350.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can simplify the division. 350 is 35 * 10. So 84700 divided by 350 is same as 84700/(35*10) = (84700/35)/10.\n\nWhat's 84700 divided by 35? Let's compute that. 35 times 2400 is 84000. 84700 - 84000 = 700. 35 * 20 is 700. So total is 2400 +20 = 2420. So 84700/35 is 2420. Then divide by 10 gives 242.\n\nSo that's the same result as before. So b is 242. But wait, 242 is a multiple of 11 because 242 / 11 is 22, which is an integer. So 242 is divisible by 11. But 350 is not. That's a problem because the GCF is 11, meaning both numbers must be divisible by 11. So how can 350 be one of the numbers?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me reread it. The problem says that the GCF of two numbers is 11, and one of the numbers is 350. Oh wait, that can't be possible because if the GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11. So if one is 350, which is not a multiple of 11, that can't be. So there's a contradiction here.\n\nWait, so that suggests that either I made a mistake in my calculation, or perhaps the problem is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I'm wrong about the formula. Let me double-check the formula. The formula is GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a*b. Yes, that's correct. So 11 *7700= 84700. So if a is 350, then b is 84700/350=242.\n\nBut then, the problem arises because 350 isn't a multiple of 11. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, or maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the GCF is not 11, but that's not what the problem says.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reevaluate. Maybe 350 is a multiple of 11. Let me check 350 divided by 11 again. 11 *31=341, 350-341=9. So 350 is 31*11 +9. So the remainder is 9, so no, 350 is not a multiple of 11. So that can't be. So how can the GCF be 11 if one of the numbers isn't a multiple of 11?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think differently. Let's suppose that the two numbers are a and b. GCF(a, b) is 11. So a =11 * m, b=11 *n, where m and n are integers, and their GCF is 1 (because if m and n had a common factor, then the GCF of a and b would be higher than 11).\n\nSo, a=11m, b=11n, and GCF(m, n)=1.\n\nNow, the LCM of a and b is 7700. The LCM of two numbers a and b is equal to (a*b)/GCF(a,b). But since a=11m and b=11n, then LCM(a,b)= (11m *11n)/11= 11 m n.\n\nSo 11 m n =7700. So m n =7700 /11 = 700.\n\nSo m*n=700. Now, since m and n are coprime (their GCF is 1), we can find pairs (m, n) where m and n are coprime and their product is 700.\n\nWe know that a is 350, so let's see. a=11m =350. So m=350/11. But 350 divided by 11 is 31.818..., which isn't an integer. So that's impossible. So that suggests that a=350 can't be one of the numbers when the GCF is 11. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is correct, and I'm making a mistake. Let me try again. Let's say a is 350, and the GCF of a and b is 11. Then 11 must divide both a and b. So 11 must divide 350. But 350/11 is not an integer. So that's impossible. So the problem must have a typo, or perhaps I misread it.\n\nWait, maybe the problem says that the GCF is 11, and one of the numbers is 350, but that's impossible. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's not one of the choices. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the answer options. The options are 242, 308, 352, 412, 456.\n\nWait, let's check each option to see which one, when paired with 350, gives GCF 11 and LCM 7700.\n\nLet me pick option A:242.\n\nCompute GCF of 350 and 242.\n\nFirst, factor both numbers.\n\n350: factors are 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242: 2 *11^2.\n\nSo the common factors are 2. So GCF is 2, not 11. So option A is incorrect.\n\nOption B:308.\n\n308: factors? Let's see. 308 divided by 2 is 154. 154 divided by 2 is 77. 77 is 7*11. So 308 =2^2 *7 *11.\n\n350 is 2 *5^2 *7.\n\nCommon factors: 2 and 7. So GCF is 2*7=14. Not 11. So option B is wrong.\n\nOption C:352.\n\n352: let's factor. 352 /2=176, /2=88, /2=44, /2=22, /2=11. So 352=2^5 *11.\n\n350 is 2 *5^2 *7. So common factors are 2. GCF is 2. Not 11. So option C is wrong.\n\nOption D:412.\n\n412: Let's factor. 412 divided by 2 is 206, again divided by 2 is 103. 103 is a prime. So 412=2^2 *103.\n\n350 is 2 *5^2 *7. So common factor is 2. GCF is 2. Not 11. So D is wrong.\n\nOption E:456.\n\n456: 456 divided by 2 is 228, divided by 2 is 114, divided by 2 is 57. 57 is 3*19. So 456=2^3 *3 *19.\n\n350 is 2 *5^2 *7. Common factor is 2. So GCF is 2. Not 11. So E is wrong.\n\nWait, but none of the options give a GCF of 11 when paired with 350. So that suggests that perhaps the correct answer isn't in the options, but that's impossible because the problem says one of them is 350.\n\nWait, but earlier I found that the other number would be 242, but that gives a GCF of 2, not 11. So that suggests that the initial approach was wrong.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me re-examine the formula. GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a*b. So if a is 350, and GCF is 11, LCM is 7700.\n\nSo 11 *7700= a*b=350*b.\n\nSo 84700 =350*b \u2192 b=84700/350=242.\n\nBut when I check the GCF of 350 and 242, it's 2, not 11. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, that suggests that the initial assumption is wrong. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the LCM is 7700, which is 700*11. Wait, 7700 is 700 * 11. Hmm, 700 is 7*100=7*(2^2 *5^2).\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe the formula is correct, but the problem is set in a way that one of the numbers is not a multiple of the GCF. Which can't be because the GCF must divide both numbers.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is wrong, but let's see the options again. None of the options when paired with 350 give a GCF of 11.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reevaluate my initial approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is correct, and the other number is 242, but the GCF is 11, but my calculation of GCF is wrong.\n\nWait, 350 is 2 * 5^2 *7.\n\n242 is 2 *11^2.\n\nSo the common factors are 2. So GCF is 2. So the problem statement must have a mistake because it says the GCF is 11.\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but the problem expects us to choose 242, which is option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says the GCF is 11, LCM is 7700, one number is 350. So the other number is 242, but that gives GCF of 2, which contradicts the problem's GCF of 11.\n\nSo perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is not applicable here. No, the formula is correct. So I'm stuck because according to the formula, the other number should be 242, but that doesn't satisfy the GCF condition.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the problem differently. Maybe I should factor both numbers into primes and see.\n\nWe know that a=350 and b=242.\n\n350=2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242=2 *11^2.\n\nSo the GCF is the product of the minimum exponents of shared primes. So the shared prime is 2. So GCF is 2^1=2.\n\nBut the problem states the GCF is 11. So this suggests that 11 must be a shared prime factor, but 350 doesn't have 11 as a factor.\n\nSo the only conclusion is that the problem is incorrect, but since the options are given, perhaps I should choose the answer that fits the formula, even if it doesn't fit the GCF condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended that the other number is 242, but that would mean the GCF is 2, which contradicts the given condition.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 350 *242.\n\nWait, 350 *242: 350*200=70000, 350*40=14000, 350*2=700. So 70000+14000=84000, +700=84700. So 350*242=84700. And 11*7700=84700, so that part checks out. But the GCF is 2, not 11.\n\nSo the only conclusion is that there's a mistake in the problem statement, perhaps the LCM is different, or the GCF is different.\n\nBut given the options, the correct answer according to the formula is 242, which is option A. So perhaps the problem intended for that, but the GCF condition is a red herring. Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another approach. Let me think about the prime factors.\n\nSince the GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11, but it's not. So perhaps the problem intended that 350 is a multiple of 11, but it's not. So perhaps the problem has a typo, and the intended number is 385, which is 35*11, but that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is correct, and the other number is 242, which is 11*22, but 350 is not a multiple of 11, which is a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the GCF of 350 and 242 again, but I think I did that right. 350 and 242 both have 2 as a factor, but no higher. So the GCF is 2.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. But according to the formula, the answer is 242, which is option A. So perhaps the problem expects that, even though it doesn't satisfy the GCF condition. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, another thought. If the GCF is 11, then both numbers must be multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11. Let me check 350/11 again.\n\n11*31 is 341. 350-341=9. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. Therefore, it's impossible for the GCF to be 11 if one of the numbers is 350. So the problem must be incorrect. But since the options are given, perhaps I should proceed.\n\nWait, but the problem gives options, and the only number that comes out of the formula is 242, which is option A. So perhaps the problem expects that, despite the GCF not being 11. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 2, but that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the product.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's let the two numbers be 11a and 11b, where a and b are coprime. Then their LCM is 11ab. So 11ab=7700 \u2192 ab=700.\n\nWe know one of the numbers is 350. So either 11a=350 or 11b=350.\n\nCase 1: 11a=350 \u2192 a=350/11 \u224831.818, which is not integer. So impossible.\n\nCase 2: 11b=350 \u2192 same issue. So impossible.\n\nSo neither a nor b can be integers in this scenario. So the problem as stated is impossible because 350 is not a multiple of 11.\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but the closest is 242, which is option A. But in reality, the problem is flawed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should choose the option that gives the correct product, even if the GCF is wrong.\n\nSo the correct answer according to the formula is 242, which is option A.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the other integer when one integer is 350, the greatest common factor (GCF) is 11, and the least common multiple (LCM) is 7700. The relationship between GCF and LCM is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{GCF}(a, b) \\times \\text{LCM}(a, b) = a \\times b\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(\\text{GCF}(a, b) = 11\\), \\(\\text{LCM}(a, b) = 7700\\), and one of the integers \\(a = 350\\). Substituting these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n11 \\times 7700 = 350 \\times b\n\\]\n\n\\[\n84700 = 350 \\times b\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(b\\):\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{84700}{350} = 242\n\\]\n\nThus, the other integer is 242. However, there is a contradiction: the GCF of 350 and 242 is not 11. Factoring both numbers:\n\n- \\(350 = 2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7\\)\n- \\(242 = 2 \\times 11^2\\)\n\nThe only common factor is 2, so \\(\\text{GCF}(350, 242) = 2\\), not 11. This suggests the problem is flawed because the GCF cannot be 11 if one of the numbers (350) is not a multiple of 11. Nevertheless, based on the formula, the other integer is 242.\n\nAmong the given options, 242 corresponds to option A. Despite the contradiction in the GCF condition, the problem likely expects this answer.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question says that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11. Their least common multiple (LCM) is 7700. One of the integers is 350, and I need to find the other one. The options are given as A to E.\n\nHmm, I remember that there's a relationship between the GCF and LCM of two numbers. Oh right! The product of the two numbers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM. So, if the numbers are a and b, then a * b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b).\n\nWait, so in this case, GCF is 11 and LCM is 7700. One of the numbers is 350, let's call that a = 350. So, we can find the other number, which I'll call b, using the formula: a * b = GCF * LCM.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. So, 350 * b = 11 * 7700.\n\nWait, calculating the right side: 11 * 7700. Let me compute that. 7700 divided by 10 is 770, so 11 * 7700 is 11 * 77 * 100. Hmm, 11 *77 is 847, so 847 * 100 is 84700. So, 350 * b = 84700.\n\nNow, to find b, I can divide both sides by 350. So, b = 84700 / 350. Let me compute that.\n\nWait, 350 goes into 84700 how many times? Let me think. 350 * 200 is 70,000. 84700 minus 70000 is 14700. 350 * 40 is 14000, so 240 so far, and 14700 - 14000 is 700. 350 goes into 700 twice. So total is 200 +40 +2 = 242. So, b is 242.\n\nLooking at the options, A is 242. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a calculation mistake. Let me calculate 350 multiplied by 242. 350 * 200 is 70,000. 350*40 is 14,000, and 350*2 is 700. So 70,000 +14,000 is 84,000. Plus 700 is 84,700. That matches 11*7700, which is 84,700. So yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Also, I should check if the GCF of 350 and 242 is indeed 11.\n\nLet me factor both numbers.\n\n350: Let's see. 350 divided by 2 is 175. 175 divided by 5 is 35. 35 divided by 5 is 7. So the prime factors are 2 * 5^2 *7.\n\n242: 242 divided by 2 is 121. 121 is 11 squared. So factors are 2 * 11^2.\n\nSo the common factors are the common primes. Both have a 2, but 350 has 2^1, 242 has 2^1. So that's 2. But wait, the GCF is supposed to be 11. Oh, wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because 350 is 2 *5^2 *7, and 242 is 2 * 11^2. So the common factors are only 2. Wait, that can't be right because the GCF is supposed to be 11. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, that would mean that my initial approach might be wrong. Because if 350 and 242 have a GCF of 2, not 11, then that can't be the correct answer. So what did I do wrong here?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in my initial calculation. Let's go back. The formula says a * b = GCF * LCM. So if a is 350, b is 242, then 350*242 = 84700, which is correct. But their GCF is 2, but according to the problem, the GCF is 11. So that's a contradiction. So my initial approach must be incorrect.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check the formula. Oh wait, no, the formula is correct. So if the product is 84700, then the other number is 242, but their GCF is 2, which is conflicting with the given GCF of 11.\n\nSo, something's wrong here. Maybe my calculation of the other number is wrong. Or perhaps I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me think: the GCF is 11, which means that both numbers are multiples of 11. So, let me express both numbers as 11 times some integers. Let a =11m and b=11n. Then, the GCF of a and b is 11 * GCF(m,n). Since the GCF is 11, that implies that m and n must be coprime (their GCF is 1).\n\nNow, the LCM of a and b would be 11 * m * n. Because LCM of 11m and 11n is 11 * LCM(m,n), and since m and n are coprime, LCM(m,n)=m*n. So LCM(a,b) =11 m n.\n\nGiven that LCM is 7700, so 11 m n =7700. So m n =7700 /11 =700.\n\nSo now, m and n are coprime integers, and their product is 700.\n\nNow, one of the numbers is 350. Let me see which one that could be.\n\nIf a=11m =350, then m =350 /11. But 350 divided by 11 is approximately 31.818, which is not an integer. So that can't be. Therefore, the other number must be 350. So, if b=11n=350, then n=350/11. Again, same problem. So that can't be either.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So neither a nor b can be 350 if they're expressed as 11m and 11n. So that suggests that either I'm making a mistake, or perhaps the initial approach was wrong.\n\nWait, no. Wait, wait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me see: 350 divided by 11. 11*31 is 341, 11*32 is 352. So 350 isn't divisible by 11. But the problem states that the GCF is 11, which implies both numbers are multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11, but wait, 350 is 35*10, which is 5*7*2*5. There's no 11 in there. So that's impossible. So that suggests that the problem is impossible. But that can't be because the problem is given as such.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different. Oh wait, I think the formula is correct: product equals GCF times LCM. So 350 * b = 11 *7700 =84700. So b=84700/350=242.\n\nBut then, as I saw, the GCF of 350 and 242 is 2, which contradicts the given GCF of 11. So that suggests that either the problem is wrong, or I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the factors. Let me recheck.\n\n350: 2 *5^2 *7. 242: 2 *11^2. So the common factors are 2. So GCF is 2, not 11.\n\nSo that's a problem. So perhaps I did something wrong in the approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I should factor 350 and find possible pairs with GCF 11 and LCM 7700.\n\nWait, 350 is given as one of the numbers. Let me factor 350: 2 *5^2 *7.\n\nSince GCF is 11, the other number must be a multiple of 11, but 350 is not a multiple of 11. So that's impossible because for the GCF to be 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11. But 350 isn't. So that's a problem. So perhaps the problem is incorrect? Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me think. The formula is a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So 350 * b = 11 * 7700. Which gives b= (11 *7700)/350. Let me compute that again.\n\n11 *7700=84700. 84700 divided by 350. Let me compute 350 into 84700.\n\n350 goes into 84700 how many times? Let's divide 84700 by 350.\n\nWell, 350 is 35 *10. So 84700 divided by 35 is 2420. Then, divided by 10 is 242. So yes, 242.\n\nSo the other number is 242. But as I saw, 350 and 242 have a GCF of 2, not 11. So that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, so perhaps there's a mistake in the problem? Or perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the factors. Let me recheck 350 and 242.\n\n350: 2 * 5^2 *7.\n\n242: 2 * 11^2.\n\nSo the GCF is 2. So that's correct. So the GCF is 2, not 11. So the problem says the GCF is 11, but according to this, it's 2. So that's impossible. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's setup.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I've made a wrong assumption somewhere.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me think about the formula again. Let me write the formula correctly.\n\nThe formula is: LCM(a, b) = (a*b) / GCF(a, b). So, rearranged, a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b).\n\nSo 350 * b = 11 *7700 = 84700.\n\nSo b=84700/350= 242.\n\nBut as before, the GCF is 2, not 11. So that's a problem.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem statement is wrong. But given that this is a multiple-choice question, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the other number is not 242, but another number from the options.\n\nWait, let me try the options to see which one gives a GCF of 11 with 350.\n\nOption A: 242. We saw GCF is 2.\n\nOption B:308. Let's factor 308. 308 divided by 2 is 154. Divided by 2 is 77. 77 is 7*11. So 308 is 2^2 *7 *11.\n\n350 is 2 *5^2 *7. So the GCF of 308 and 350: the common primes are 2 and 7. So 2^1 *7^1=14. So GCF is 14, which is higher than 11. So that's not matching.\n\nOption C:352. Let's factor 352. 352 divided by 2 is 176, divided by 2 is 88, again by 2 is 44, again by 2 is 22, again by 2 is 11. So 352 is 2^6 *11.\n\n350 is 2 *5^2 *7. Common factors: 2^1. So GCF is 2. Not 11.\n\nOption D:412. Let's factor 412. 412 divided by 2 is 206, divided by 2 is 103, which is a prime. So 412 is 2^2 *103.\n\n350 is 2*5^2 *7. Common factor is 2. So GCF is 2.\n\nOption E:456. Let's factor 456. 456 divided by 2 is 228, again by 2 is 114, again by 2 is 57. 57 is 3*19. So 456 is 2^3 *3 *19.\n\n350 is 2 *5^2 *7. Common factor is 2. GCF is 2.\n\nSo none of the options have a GCF of 11 with 350. Because all options when multiplied with 350 give a product of 11*7700=84700, but the GCF is 2 for all except option B, which has a GCF of 14.\n\nSo this suggests that the problem might have an error. Or perhaps I've made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. Let me try to find a number b such that GCF(350, b) =11 and LCM(350, b)=7700.\n\nSince GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11.\n\nSo 350 must be a multiple of 11. Wait, but 350 divided by 11 is about 31.818, which is not an integer. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. Therefore, it's impossible for the GCF to be 11 because both numbers must be multiples of 11 for the GCF to be 11.\n\nSo that suggests that there's no such number b that satisfies the conditions. But since the problem says one of the integers is 350, and the options are given, perhaps I've made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is correct, and I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me recheck the formula.\n\nThe formula is correct: a * b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So 350 * b = 11 *7700.\n\nSo 350 * b =84700 \u2192 b=84700/350=242. So the other number is 242.\n\nBut as I saw, 350 and 242 have a GCF of 2, not 11. So this is a contradiction. So perhaps the problem is incorrect.\n\nBut that's unlikely because the problem is given as an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the factors.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate the GCF of 350 and 242.\n\n350: 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242: 2 *11^2.\n\nCommon factors: 2. So GCF is 2. So that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 2, not 11. But that's not what's stated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the product. Let me recheck: 11 *7700=84700. 350 *242= 84700. Correct.\n\nSo, unless I'm missing something, the answer as per the formula is 242, but the GCF is not 11, so the problem is incorrect. But given that the options include 242 as option A, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the problem is correct and I'm missing a point.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the numbers as 11 times something else. Let me try again.\n\nExpress 350 as 11 * m and b as 11 * n. Then, 350=11m \u2192 m=350/11\u224831.818, which isn't an integer. So that's impossible. So the only way for both numbers to be multiples of 11 is if 350 is a multiple of 11, which it isn't. Therefore, the problem as stated is impossible. But since the problem is given, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the other number as a multiple of 11, and 350 as a multiple of 11. But 350 isn't, so that's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is misstated, and the GCF is 2, not 11. But the problem says 11.\n\nIn that case, perhaps the correct answer is 242, even though the GCF isn't 11, which would imply a mistake in the problem. But since I have to choose from the options, perhaps the answer is A)242.\n\nBut wait, that would mean the problem is incorrect, which is unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is a*b = GCF * LCM, but I applied it to 350 and 242, which gives the correct product, but their GCF is 2, not 11. So perhaps the problem intended that the GCF is 2, but it's stated as 11.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think that 350 is a multiple of 11, but I'm wrong.\n\nWait, 350 divided by 11: 11*31=341, 11*32=352. So 350 is between 31 and 32 times 11. So it's not a multiple.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe the problem is correct, and I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the LCM is 7700, which is 77 *100. 77 is 7*11, 100 is 2^2*5^2. So 7700=2^2 *5^2 *7 *11.\n\n350 is 2 *5^2 *7. So the LCM of 350 and b would be 7700. So, 350 is 2*5^2*7. The LCM must include all prime factors from both numbers. So, the other number, b, must have the prime factors that 350 doesn't have, but in such a way that when combined, the LCM is 7700.\n\nWait, 7700 is 2^2 *5^2 *7 *11.\n\n350 is 2^1 *5^2 *7^1.\n\nSo, the other number, b, must have 2^2 (since 350 has 2^1, and LCM is 2^2), 11^1 (since 350 has none), and any other factors.\n\nWait, but for the GCF to be 11, both numbers must be divisible by 11. So, 350 must be divisible by 11, which it isn't. So that's impossible.\n\nWait, so perhaps the problem is impossible as stated. But since the options are given, perhaps I should proceed with the initial approach, even though the GCF doesn't match.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense. So perhaps the correct answer is A)242, despite the GCF being 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 2, but it's given as 11. So in that case, the answer would be 242.\n\nBut the problem says GCF is 11, so I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the two numbers as 350 and b, with GCF 11, LCM 7700.\n\nBut 350 isn't a multiple of 11, so that's impossible.\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but since it is, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me think of the two numbers as a=350 and b.\n\nWe know that GCF(a,b)=11, so both a and b must be multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11. But 350/11=31.818... which isn't an integer. So that's impossible. Therefore, there is no such number b that satisfies the conditions. So the problem is incorrect.\n\nBut since the problem is given, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the formula.\n\nWait, another formula: LCM(a,b) = (a*b) / GCF(a,b).\n\nSo, 7700 = (350 *b)/11 \u2192 7700 *11=350*b \u2192 84700=350b \u2192 b=84700/350=242.\n\nSo, the other number is 242. But as before, GCF(350,242)=2, which doesn't match the given GCF of 11.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem has an error, but given the options, the correct answer must be A)242.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question says that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11. Their least common multiple (LCM) is 7700. One of the integers is 350, and I need to find the other one. The options are given as A to E.\n\nHmm, I remember that there's a relationship between the GCF and LCM of two numbers. Oh right! The product of the two numbers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM. So, if the numbers are a and b, then a * b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b).\n\nWait, so in this case, GCF is 11 and LCM is 7700. One of the numbers is 350, let's call that a = 350. So, we can find the other number, which I'll call b, using the formula: a * b = GCF * LCM.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. So, 350 * b = 11 * 7700.\n\nWait, calculating the right side: 11 * 7700. Let me compute that. 7700 divided by 10 is 770, so 11 * 7700 is 11 * 77 * 100. Hmm, 11 *77 is 847, so 847 * 100 is 84700. So, 350 * b = 84700.\n\nNow, to find b, I can divide both sides by 350. So, b = 84700 / 350. Let me compute that.\n\nWait, 350 goes into 84700 how many times? Let me think. 350 * 200 is 70,000. 84700 minus 70000 is 14700. 350 * 40 is 14000, so 240 so far, and 14700 - 14000 is 700. 350 goes into 700 twice. So total is 200 +40 +2 = 242. So, b is 242.\n\nLooking at the options, A is 242. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a calculation mistake. Let me calculate 350 multiplied by 242. 350 * 200 is 70,000. 350*40 is 14,000, and 350*2 is 700. So 70,000 +14,000 is 84,000. Plus 700 is 84,700. That matches 11*7700, which is 84,700. So yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Also, I should check if the GCF of 350 and 242 is indeed 11.\n\nLet me factor both numbers.\n\n350: Let's see. 350 divided by 2 is 175. 175 divided by 5 is 35. 35 divided by 5 is 7. So the prime factors are 2 * 5^2 *7.\n\n242: 242 divided by 2 is 121. 121 is 11 squared. So factors are 2 * 11^2.\n\nSo the common factors are the common primes. Both have a 2, but 350 has 2^1, 242 has 2^1. So that's 2. But wait, the GCF is supposed to be 11. Oh, wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because 350 is 2 *5^2 *7, and 242 is 2 * 11^2. So the common factors are only 2. Wait, that can't be right because the GCF is supposed to be 11. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, that would mean that my initial approach might be wrong. Because if 350 and 242 have a GCF of 2, not 11, then that can't be the correct answer. So what did I do wrong here?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in my initial calculation. Let's go back. The formula says a * b = GCF * LCM. So if a is 350, b is 242, then 350*242 = 84700, which is correct. But their GCF is 2, but according to the problem, the GCF is 11. So that's a contradiction. So my initial approach must be incorrect.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check the formula. Oh wait, no, the formula is correct. So if the product is 84700, then the other number is 242, but their GCF is 2, which is conflicting with the given GCF of 11.\n\nSo, something's wrong here. Maybe my calculation of the other number is wrong. Or perhaps I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me think: the GCF is 11, which means that both numbers are multiples of 11. So, let me express both numbers as 11 times some integers. Let a =11m and b=11n. Then, the GCF of a and b is 11 * GCF(m,n). Since the GCF is 11, that implies that m and n must be coprime (their GCF is 1).\n\nNow, the LCM of a and b would be 11 * m * n. Because LCM of 11m and 11n is 11 * LCM(m,n), and since m and n are coprime, LCM(m,n)=m*n. So LCM(a,b) =11 m n.\n\nGiven that LCM is 7700, so 11 m n =7700. So m n =7700 /11 =700.\n\nSo now, m and n are coprime integers, and their product is 700.\n\nNow, one of the numbers is 350. Let me see which one that could be.\n\nIf a=11m =350, then m =350 /11. But 350 divided by 11 is approximately 31.818, which is not an integer. So that can't be. Therefore, the other number must be 350. So, if b=11n=350, then n=350/11. Again, same problem. So that can't be either.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So neither a nor b can be 350 if they're expressed as 11m and 11n. So that suggests that either I'm making a mistake, or perhaps the initial approach was wrong.\n\nWait, no. Wait, wait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me see: 350 divided by 11. 11*31 is 341, 11*32 is 352. So 350 isn't divisible by 11. But the problem states that the GCF is 11, which implies both numbers are multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11, but wait, 350 is 35*10, which is 5*7*2*5. There's no 11 in there. So that's impossible. So that suggests that the problem is impossible. But that can't be because the problem is given as such.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different. Oh wait, I think the formula is correct: product equals GCF times LCM. So 350 * b = 11 *7700 =84700. So b=84700/350=242.\n\nBut then, as I saw, the GCF of 350 and 242 is 2, which contradicts the given GCF of 11. So that suggests that either the problem is wrong, or I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the factors. Let me recheck.\n\n350: 2 *5^2 *7. 242: 2 *11^2. So the common factors are 2. So GCF is 2, not 11.\n\nSo that's a problem. So perhaps I did something wrong in the approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I should factor 350 and find possible pairs with GCF 11 and LCM 7700.\n\nWait, 350 is given as one of the numbers. Let me factor 350: 2 *5^2 *7.\n\nSince GCF is 11, the other number must be a multiple of 11, but 350 is not a multiple of 11. So that's impossible because for the GCF to be 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11. But 350 isn't. So that's a problem. So perhaps the problem is incorrect? Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me think. The formula is a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So 350 * b = 11 * 7700. Which gives b= (11 *7700)/350. Let me compute that again.\n\n11 *7700=84700. 84700 divided by 350. Let me compute 350 into 84700.\n\n350 goes into 84700 how many times? Let's divide 84700 by 350.\n\nWell, 350 is 35 *10. So 84700 divided by 35 is 2420. Then, divided by 10 is 242. So yes, 242.\n\nSo the other number is 242. But as I saw, 350 and 242 have a GCF of 2, not 11. So that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, so perhaps there's a mistake in the problem? Or perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the factors. Let me recheck 350 and 242.\n\n350: 2 * 5^2 *7.\n\n242: 2 * 11^2.\n\nSo the GCF is 2. So that's correct. So the GCF is 2, not 11. So the problem says the GCF is 11, but according to this, it's 2. So that's impossible. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's setup.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I've made a wrong assumption somewhere.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me think about the formula again. Let me write the formula correctly.\n\nThe formula is: LCM(a, b) = (a*b) / GCF(a, b). So, rearranged, a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b).\n\nSo 350 * b = 11 *7700 = 84700.\n\nSo b=84700/350= 242.\n\nBut as before, the GCF is 2, not 11. So that's a problem.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem statement is wrong. But given that this is a multiple-choice question, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the other number is not 242, but another number from the options.\n\nWait, let me try the options to see which one gives a GCF of 11 with 350.\n\nOption A: 242. We saw GCF is 2.\n\nOption B:308. Let's factor 308. 308 divided by 2 is 154. Divided by 2 is 77. 77 is 7*11. So 308 is 2^2 *7 *11.\n\n350 is 2 *5^2 *7. So the GCF of 308 and 350: the common primes are 2 and 7. So 2^1 *7^1=14. So GCF is 14, which is higher than 11. So that's not matching.\n\nOption C:352. Let's factor 352. 352 divided by 2 is 176, divided by 2 is 88, again by 2 is 44, again by 2 is 22, again by 2 is 11. So 352 is 2^6 *11.\n\n350 is 2 *5^2 *7. Common factors: 2^1. So GCF is 2. Not 11.\n\nOption D:412. Let's factor 412. 412 divided by 2 is 206, divided by 2 is 103, which is a prime. So 412 is 2^2 *103.\n\n350 is 2*5^2 *7. Common factor is 2. So GCF is 2.\n\nOption E:456. Let's factor 456. 456 divided by 2 is 228, again by 2 is 114, again by 2 is 57. 57 is 3*19. So 456 is 2^3 *3 *19.\n\n350 is 2 *5^2 *7. Common factor is 2. GCF is 2.\n\nSo none of the options have a GCF of 11 with 350. Because all options when multiplied with 350 give a product of 11*7700=84700, but the GCF is 2 for all except option B, which has a GCF of 14.\n\nSo this suggests that the problem might have an error. Or perhaps I've made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. Let me try to find a number b such that GCF(350, b) =11 and LCM(350, b)=7700.\n\nSince GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11.\n\nSo 350 must be a multiple of 11. Wait, but 350 divided by 11 is about 31.818, which is not an integer. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. Therefore, it's impossible for the GCF to be 11 because both numbers must be multiples of 11 for the GCF to be 11.\n\nSo that suggests that there's no such number b that satisfies the conditions. But since the problem says one of the integers is 350, and the options are given, perhaps I've made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is correct, and I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me recheck the formula.\n\nThe formula is correct: a * b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So 350 * b = 11 *7700.\n\nSo 350 * b =84700 \u2192 b=84700/350=242. So the other number is 242.\n\nBut as I saw, 350 and 242 have a GCF of 2, not 11. So this is a contradiction. So perhaps the problem is incorrect.\n\nBut that's unlikely because the problem is given as an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the factors.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate the GCF of 350 and 242.\n\n350: 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242: 2 *11^2.\n\nCommon factors: 2. So GCF is 2. So that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 2, not 11. But that's not what's stated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the product. Let me recheck: 11 *7700=84700. 350 *242= 84700. Correct.\n\nSo, unless I'm missing something, the answer as per the formula is 242, but the GCF is not 11, so the problem is incorrect. But given that the options include 242 as option A, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the problem is correct and I'm missing a point.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the numbers as 11 times something else. Let me try again.\n\nExpress 350 as 11 * m and b as 11 * n. Then, 350=11m \u2192 m=350/11\u224831.818, which isn't an integer. So that's impossible. So the only way for both numbers to be multiples of 11 is if 350 is a multiple of 11, which it isn't. Therefore, the problem as stated is impossible. But since the problem is given, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the other number as a multiple of 11, and 350 as a multiple of 11. But 350 isn't, so that's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is misstated, and the GCF is 2, not 11. But the problem says 11.\n\nIn that case, perhaps the correct answer is 242, even though the GCF isn't 11, which would imply a mistake in the problem. But since I have to choose from the options, perhaps the answer is A)242.\n\nBut wait, that would mean the problem is incorrect, which is unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is a*b = GCF * LCM, but I applied it to 350 and 242, which gives the correct product, but their GCF is 2, not 11. So perhaps the problem intended that the GCF is 2, but it's stated as 11.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think that 350 is a multiple of 11, but I'm wrong.\n\nWait, 350 divided by 11: 11*31=341, 11*32=352. So 350 is between 31 and 32 times 11. So it's not a multiple.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe the problem is correct, and I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the LCM is 7700, which is 77 *100. 77 is 7*11, 100 is 2^2*5^2. So 7700=2^2 *5^2 *7 *11.\n\n350 is 2 *5^2 *7. So the LCM of 350 and b would be 7700. So, 350 is 2*5^2*7. The LCM must include all prime factors from both numbers. So, the other number, b, must have the prime factors that 350 doesn't have, but in such a way that when combined, the LCM is 7700.\n\nWait, 7700 is 2^2 *5^2 *7 *11.\n\n350 is 2^1 *5^2 *7^1.\n\nSo, the other number, b, must have 2^2 (since 350 has 2^1, and LCM is 2^2), 11^1 (since 350 has none), and any other factors.\n\nWait, but for the GCF to be 11, both numbers must be divisible by 11. So, 350 must be divisible by 11, which it isn't. So that's impossible.\n\nWait, so perhaps the problem is impossible as stated. But since the options are given, perhaps I should proceed with the initial approach, even though the GCF doesn't match.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense. So perhaps the correct answer is A)242, despite the GCF being 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 2, but it's given as 11. So in that case, the answer would be 242.\n\nBut the problem says GCF is 11, so I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the two numbers as 350 and b, with GCF 11, LCM 7700.\n\nBut 350 isn't a multiple of 11, so that's impossible.\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but since it is, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me think of the two numbers as a=350 and b.\n\nWe know that GCF(a,b)=11, so both a and b must be multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11. But 350/11=31.818... which isn't an integer. So that's impossible. Therefore, there is no such number b that satisfies the conditions. So the problem is incorrect.\n\nBut since the problem is given, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the formula.\n\nWait, another formula: LCM(a,b) = (a*b) / GCF(a,b).\n\nSo, 7700 = (350 *b)/11 \u2192 7700 *11=350*b \u2192 84700=350b \u2192 b=84700/350=242.\n\nSo, the other number is 242. But as before, GCF(350,242)=2, which doesn't match the given GCF of 11.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem has an error, but given the options, the correct answer must be A)242.\n\n\nThe problem states that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11, their least common multiple (LCM) is 7700, and one of the integers is 350. The task is to find the other integer.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Relationship Between GCF and LCM**:  \n   The product of two numbers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM:  \n   \\[\n   a \\times b = \\text{GCF}(a, b) \\times \\text{LCM}(a, b)\n   \\]  \n   Substituting the given values:  \n   \\[\n   350 \\times b = 11 \\times 7700\n   \\]  \n   Simplifying the right-hand side:  \n   \\[\n   11 \\times 7700 = 84700\n   \\]  \n   Solving for \\( b \\):  \n   \\[\n   b = \\frac{84700}{350} = 242\n   \\]\n\n2. **Verification of GCF**:  \n   The problem states that the GCF of the two numbers is 11. To confirm this, factorize both numbers:  \n   - \\( 350 = 2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7 \\)  \n   - \\( 242 = 2 \\times 11^2 \\)  \n\n   The common factor between 350 and 242 is \\( 2 \\), not \\( 11 \\). This contradicts the given condition that the GCF is 11.\n\n3. **Re-examining the Options**:  \n   The options provided are:  \n   A) 242, B) 308, C) 352, D) 412, E) 456.  \n\n   Factoring each option and calculating the GCF with 350:  \n   - \\( 242 = 2 \\times 11^2 \\): GCF with 350 is \\( 2 \\).  \n   - \\( 308 = 2^2 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\): GCF with 350 is \\( 14 \\).  \n   - \\( 352 = 2^6 \\times 11 \\): GCF with 350 is \\( 2 \\).  \n   - \\( 412 = 2^2 \\times 103 \\): GCF with 350 is \\( 2 \\).  \n   - \\( 456 = 2^3 \\times 3 \\times 19 \\): GCF with 350 is \\( 2 \\).  \n\n   None of the options have a GCF of 11 with 350.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:  \n   The calculation using the formula \\( a \\times b = \\text{GCF}(a, b) \\times \\text{LCM}(a, b) \\) gives \\( b = 242 \\). However, the GCF of 350 and 242 is \\( 2 \\), not \\( 11 \\), which contradicts the problem's condition. Despite this inconsistency, the only option that satisfies the product condition is \\( 242 \\). Therefore, the answer must be **A) 242**, assuming the problem intends for this result.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about finding the other integer when given the GCF and LCM of two numbers. Hmm, I remember that GCF stands for Greatest Common Factor and LCM is Least Common Multiple. The problem says that the GCF is 11 and the LCM is 7700. One of the numbers is 350, and I need to find the other. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nWait, I think there's a formula that relates GCF and LCM of two numbers. Oh right! The product of the two numbers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM. So if the numbers are a and b, then a * b = GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b). That makes sense because GCF is the greatest common divisor, and LCM is the least common multiple. So I can use this formula to find the missing number.\n\nLet me write that down. So, a * b = GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b). I know a is 350, and the GCF is 11, LCM is 7700. So plugging in the values, 350 * b = 11 * 7700. Wait, what's 11 times 7700? Let me calculate that. 7700 divided by 10 is 770, so 11 times 7700 is 7700 * 10 + 7700 * 1 = 77000 + 7700 = 84700. So 350 * b = 84700.\n\nNow I need to solve for b. So b = 84700 divided by 350. Hmm, let me compute that. Let me see, 350 goes into 84700 how many times? Let's do the division step by step.\n\nFirst, simplify the numbers. Both numerator and denominator can be divided by 50. So 84700 divided by 50 is 1694, and 350 divided by 50 is 7. So now it's 1694 divided by 7. Let's do that division. 7 into 16 is 2, 2*7=14, subtract 16-14=2. Bring down 9, making 29. 7 into 29 is 4, 4*7=28, subtract 29-28=1. Bring down 4, making 14. 7 into 14 is 2, 2*7=14, subtract, 0. So 1694/7 is 242. So b is 242.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that 242 is correct. Let me check the GCF of 350 and 242. The GCF should be 11. Let's factor both numbers.\n\n350: Let's break it down. 350 divided by 2 is 175. 175 divided by 5 is 35. 35 divided by 5 is 7. So 350 is 2 * 5^2 * 7.\n\n242: Let's see, 242 divided by 2 is 121. 121 is 11^2. So 242 is 2 * 11^2.\n\nSo the prime factors of 350 are 2, 5, 5, 7. For 242, it's 2, 11, 11. The common factors are just the 2. Wait, no. Wait, 350 has a 2 and 242 has a 2, so the GCF is 2? But the problem states the GCF is 11. That can't be right. Did I do something wrong?\n\nOh wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check. So, 350 * b = 11 * 7700. 11 *7700 is 84700. So 350 * b = 84700. So b = 84700 /350. Let me calculate that again.\n\nWait, 350 times 242 is 84700? Let me check: 350 * 200 = 70,000. 350 *42 is 14,700. So 70,000 +14,700=84,700. Yes, that's correct. So the product is right. But then why is the GCF 2, not 11? That's a problem because the question says the GCF is 11.\n\nHmm, that suggests that either my approach is wrong, or maybe I made a mistake in the factors. Wait, let me re-examine the numbers. Wait, 350 is 2*5^2*7. 242 is 2*11^2. So the common factors are 2, right? So the GCF is 2. But the question says GCF is 11. So that can't be.\n\nSo that means I must have done something wrong in my calculation. Wait, maybe I miscalculated the product. Let me check 11 *7700 again. 7700 times 10 is 77000, plus 7700 is 84700. Yes, that's correct. So 350 *b is 84700, so b is 242. But the GCF is wrong. So maybe I messed up the formula.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the formula isn't just GCF * LCM = a * b? Let me make sure. Oh wait, no, the formula is correct. Because if you have two numbers, their product equals the product of their GCF and LCM. So if I did that correctly, then why is the GCF wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the factors. Let me factor 242 again. 242 divided by 2 is 121. 121 is 11*11. So 242 is 2 * 11^2. 350 is 2*5^2*7. So the GCF is the product of the smallest power of each common prime factor. The primes in 350 are 2,5,7. In 242, they are 2 and 11. So the only common prime is 2. So the GCF is 2. But the problem states the GCF is 11, so that's a contradiction. So something's wrong here.\n\nWait, maybe I used the wrong formula? Let me think again. Oh, wait! The formula is a * b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So if a is 350, b is 242, then 350*242=84700. GCF is 2, LCM is (350*242)/2=42350. But the problem says the LCM is 7700. So that's not matching either.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I did a mistake in calculating 350 *242. Let me compute 350 *242 again. 350 *200 is 70,000. 350 *40 is 14,000. 350 *2 is 700. So 70,000 +14,000=84,000 plus 700 is 84,700. So that's correct.\n\nSo perhaps my approach is wrong. Let me think again. Maybe the formula is correct, but the problem is that the given numbers don't satisfy the GCF condition, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of b.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the GCF is 11, so perhaps I need to find a number such that when multiplied by 350, it gives 11 *7700, and also that the GCF is 11. So maybe the mistake is that I calculated b as 242, but 242's GCF with 350 is 2, not 11. So perhaps I need to adjust my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should factor 350 and 7700 to see what's going on. Let's see.\n\n350 is 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n7700 is 77 * 100. 77 is 7*11, and 100 is 2^2 *5^2. So 7700 is 2^2 *5^2 *7 *11.\n\nThe LCM of the two numbers is 7700, which is the product of the highest powers of all primes present in either number. So the primes involved are 2,5,7,11.\n\nSo, for the two numbers a and b, a is 350 (2 *5^2 *7), and b is something else. The LCM is 2^2 *5^2 *7 *11.\n\nSo the exponents for each prime in the LCM are the maximum of the exponents in a and b.\n\nSo for prime 2: in a it's 1, in LCM it's 2. So in b, it must be 2.\n\nFor prime 5: a has 2, LCM has 2, so b can have up to 2.\n\nFor prime 7: a has 1, LCM has 1, so b can have 0 or 1.\n\nFor prime 11: a has 0, LCM has 1, so b must have 1.\n\nSo, b's prime factors would be 2^2 *5^x *7^y *11^1, where x can be 0,1, or 2, and y can be 0 or 1.\n\nBut the GCF of a and b is 11. The GCF is the product of the minimum exponents of each prime.\n\nSo for each prime:\n\n- For 2: a has 1, b has 2. So min is 1.\n\n- For 5: a has 2, b has x. So min is min(2, x). But the GCF is 11, which is 11^1. So for all other primes, their exponents in GCF must be zero, meaning that in the GCF, the only prime is 11. Therefore, for 2,5,7, the min exponents must be zero. Wait, that can't be right because a and b both have 2 as a factor. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, the GCF is 11, which is 11^1. So for all primes except 11, the minimum exponents between a and b must be zero. That is, for each prime p \u226011, either a has exponent zero or b has exponent zero.\n\nWait, that can't be because a is 350, which has 2,5,7. So in order for the GCF to be 11, the other number b must have zero exponents for 2,5,7. Because a has 2,5,7, and if b has any of those, the GCF would include those as well, which would make the GCF higher than 11.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, for the GCF to be 11, which is a prime, the two numbers must share only the factor 11. So a is 350, which has 2,5,7, but no 11. So the other number, b, must have 11 as a factor, but no factors of 2,5,7. Because if b had any of those, the GCF would include them.\n\nWait, but wait, a is 350, which is 2 *5^2 *7. So if b has any of those primes (2,5,7), the GCF would include them, which would make the GCF higher than 11. So to have GCF 11, b must have 11 as a factor but must not have 2,5, or 7 as factors.\n\nSo, that means b must be a multiple of 11, but not a multiple of 2,5, or7.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation gave me b=242, which is 2 *11^2. So that's a problem because it has a factor of 2, which would make the GCF of a and b include 2. But the GCF is supposed to be 11.\n\nSo I must have messed up my initial approach. So perhaps the formula isn't sufficient, or I need to apply it differently.\n\nWait, maybe the formula a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b) is correct, but I have to ensure that the numbers a and b also satisfy the GCF condition. So using the formula gave me a number b=242, but that doesn't satisfy the GCF condition. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's let the two numbers be 350 and x. GCF(350, x) =11, and LCM(350, x)=7700.\n\nSo, 350 can be written as 350 = 2 * 5^2 *7. And x can be written as x = 11 * k, where k is an integer that doesn't share any common factors with 350/11's factors. Wait, because GCF is 11, which is a prime, so x must be a multiple of 11, but not share any other prime factors with 350.\n\nSo, x =11 * m, where m is an integer that is co-prime with 350/11. Wait, but 350 is 2*5^2*7, so 350 is not a multiple of 11. So, the GCF(350, x)=11 implies that x is a multiple of 11, and that 11 is the only common prime factor between 350 and x. So, m must be co-prime with 350, meaning m must not have factors of 2,5,7.\n\nNow, the LCM of 350 and x is 7700. Let's express 7700 in terms of its prime factors. 7700 is 77 * 100, which is 7*11 * 2^2 *5^2. So, 7700=2^2 *5^2 *7 *11.\n\nThe LCM of two numbers is the product of the highest powers of all primes present in either number. So, 350 is 2^1 *5^2 *7^1, and x is 11^1 * m. So, the LCM would be the max exponents:\n\n- For 2: max(1, exponent in x). Since x is 11*m and m can't have 2, so exponent of 2 in x is 0. So max is 1.\n\nWait, but wait, the LCM is given as 7700, which has 2^2. So that's a problem. Because 350 has 2^1, and x has 2^0 (since m can't have 2), so the max would be 1. But the LCM is 2^2. So this suggests that x must have 2^2, which contradicts the earlier condition that m can't have factors of 2, because x is 11*m, and m can't have 2 as a factor.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nLet me think again: since the GCF is 11, which is a prime, the two numbers must be of the form 11 * a and 11 * b, where a and b are co-prime (i.e., GCF(a,b)=1).\n\nBecause if they had any other common factors, the GCF would be higher than 11.\n\nSo, let me set 350 as 11 * a, but wait, 350 divided by 11 is approximately 31.818, which is not an integer. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. So that approach won't work because one of the numbers isn't a multiple of 11. Hmm.\n\nWait, but if the GCF is 11, then both numbers must be multiples of 11. Because GCF is the greatest common factor, so if 11 is a factor of both, then both must be multiples of 11. But 350 isn't a multiple of 11. So that's a problem.\n\nWait a minute, 350 divided by 11 is 350/11=31.818, which is not an integer. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. That can't be, because if the GCF of 350 and x is 11, then 11 must divide both numbers. So 350 must be divisible by 11. But 350 isn't. So that suggests that there's a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no, the problem says that one of the numbers is 350, and the GCF is 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11. Let me check that again. 350 divided by 11: 11 *31 is 341, 350-341=9, so 350=11*31 +9. So remainder 9, so 350 is not a multiple of 11. That's impossible because if the GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11, which it's not. That suggests that there's no solution. But the problem gives options, so that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me re-calculate 350 divided by 11. 11 *31 is 341. 350 minus 341 is 9. So 350 =11*31 +9. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. Therefore, the GCF of 350 and any other number can't be 11. Because 350 isn't divisible by 11, so 11 can't be a common factor.\n\nBut the problem states that the GCF is 11. That's a contradiction. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, or perhaps I've made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the formula. Let me go back. The formula says a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So if a is 350, b is x, then 350 * x = 11 *7700 =84700. So x=84700/350=242. So x is 242. But as I saw earlier, 242 is 2*11^2, and 350 is 2*5^2*7. So the GCF is 2, not 11. So that's a problem.\n\nSo, according to the formula, the other number is 242, but that doesn't satisfy the GCF condition. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is correct, but perhaps the problem has a typo, or I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of 350 as a multiple of 11. But it's not.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the product. Let me check 350 *242 again. 350 *200=70000, 350*42=14700. 70000+14700=84700. Yes, that's correct. So the product is correct. But the GCF is 2, not 11.\n\nSo, given that, the problem must have an error. But the problem gives options, so perhaps I should re-examine my earlier steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is only valid when the two numbers are co-prime with their own factors. Or maybe I'm missing a condition.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula a*b=GCF(a,b)*LCM(a,b) is correct, but when GCF is 11, and one of the numbers is 350, which isn't a multiple of 11, then the other number must be a multiple of 11, but the product would require that 350 is a multiple of 11, which it isn't. Therefore, there must be no solution, but the problem gives options, so that's not possible.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the initial approach. Let me try a different method. Let me suppose that the two numbers are 350 and x. Their GCF is 11, so 11 must divide both. So 350 must be a multiple of 11. But as I saw earlier, 350 divided by 11 is 31.818, which is not an integer. Therefore, this is impossible. So there's no such integer x that satisfies the conditions.\n\nBut the problem gives options, so that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that both numbers must be multiples of the GCF. Because the GCF is 11, which is a prime, both numbers must be multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11, but it's not. Therefore, the problem must be wrong, or perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps 350 is a multiple of 11. Let me check again. 11 *31=341. 341 +11=352, which is 11*32. So 350 is between 341 and 352. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. Therefore, this is impossible.\n\nWait, but then the problem must have an error. But since the options are given, perhaps the correct approach is to proceed with the formula, even though it leads to a GCF that doesn't match. But that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think that the other number is a multiple of 11, but not share any other factors with 350. So, since the GCF is 11, the other number x must be a multiple of 11, but must not share any other prime factors with 350.\n\nSo, x=11 *k, where k is an integer that is co-prime with 350/11. Wait, 350 is 2*5^2*7, so 350 and x must share only 11 as a common factor.\n\nSo, the LCM of 350 and x is 7700. Let's compute the LCM in terms of x. Since x=11*k and k is co-prime with 350, the LCM of 350 and x would be 350 *x / GCF(350, x). But GCF(350, x) is 11. So LCM = (350 * x)/11.\n\nWe are given that LCM is 7700. So,\n\n(350 *x)/11 =7700\n\nMultiply both sides by 11:\n\n350 *x =7700 *11\n\nCompute 7700 *11: 7700 *10=77000, plus 7700=84700.\n\nSo 350 *x=84700 \u2192 x=84700/350=242, as before.\n\nBut x=242, which is 2*11^2. So, 242 shares a factor of 2 with 350, which has 2 as a prime factor. Therefore, the GCF of 350 and 242 is 2, not 11. So this contradicts the given condition.\n\nTherefore, there's no solution, but the problem gives options, so perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is being misapplied. Let me think again. The formula a*b = GCF(a,b)*LCM(a,b) is correct. So, given that, the only possible value for x is 242. But that doesn't satisfy the GCF condition. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a mistake, but since the options include 242 as option A, perhaps that's the intended answer, despite the inconsistency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the prime factors. Let me check 350 and 242 again.\n\n350: 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242: 2 *11^2.\n\nSo the common factors are 2, so GCF is 2. So this can't be the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the question was supposed to have a GCF of 2, but that's not what's stated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think differently. Maybe I should express both numbers in terms of their GCF.\n\nSo, since GCF is 11, I can write the numbers as 11*a and 11*b, where a and b are coprime integers (i.e., their GCF is 1). Then, the LCM of the two numbers would be 11*a*b, because LCM of 11a and 11b is 11*LCM(a,b) =11*a*b, since a and b are coprime.\n\nSo, given that, the LCM is 7700, so 11*a*b=7700 \u2192 a*b=7700/11=700.\n\nOne of the numbers is 350, which is 11*a. So 11*a=350 \u2192 a=350/11 \u224831.818, which is not an integer. So that's impossible. Therefore, there's no solution.\n\nWait, but that's impossible because the problem gives options. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but since I have to choose from the options, perhaps the intended answer is 242, even though it's incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that both numbers must be multiples of the GCF. Because if the GCF is 11, then both numbers must be multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11, but it's not. Therefore, the problem is impossible, but the options suggest that 242 is the answer.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me factor 7700 into its prime factors again. 7700=77*100=7*11 *2^2 *5^2.\n\nThe LCM of 350 and x is 7700. So, 350 is 2*5^2*7. So the LCM must have the maximum exponents of each prime present in either number.\n\nSo, for 2: max between 350's 2^1 and x's 2^k.\n\nFor 5: max between 5^2 and x's 5^m.\n\nFor 7: max between 7^1 and x's 7^n.\n\nFor 11: max between 11^0 (since 350 has no 11) and x's 11^p.\n\nThe LCM has 2^2,5^2,7^1,11^1.\n\nSo, for 2: x must have 2^2, because 350 has 2^1. So x must have 2^2.\n\nFor 5: x can have up to 5^2, but since the LCM has 5^2, x can have 5^0,5^1, or 5^2.\n\nFor 7: x can have up to 7^1, but the LCM has 7^1, so x can have 7^0 or 7^1.\n\nFor 11: x must have 11^1, because the LCM has 11^1 and 350 has none.\n\nSo, x must be 2^2 *5^a *7^b *11^1, where a is 0,1,2 and b is 0 or1.\n\nBut the GCF of 350 and x must be 11.\n\nThe GCF is the product of the minimum exponents of each prime.\n\nSo, for each prime:\n\n- 2: min(1,2)=1 \u2192 contributes 2^1.\n\n- 5: min(2, a) \u2192 must be 0, because GCF is 11 (which is 11^1), so the other primes' exponents must be 0. Therefore, min(2, a) must be 0. So a must be 0.\n\n- 7: min(1, b) \u2192 must be 0. So b must be 0.\n\n- 11: min(0,1)=0 \u2192 but wait, 350 has 0 exponent for 11, so the min is 0. But we need the GCF to be 11, which is 11^1. That's a problem.\n\nWait, no. Because the GCF is 11, which is 11^1. So for the GCF to be 11, all other primes' exponents must be zero. So:\n\n- For 2: min(1, 2) =1 \u2192 which would mean the GCF includes 2^1. But the GCF is supposed to be 11, which doesn't include 2. Therefore, this is impossible.\n\nSo, this suggests that there's no solution, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nBut the problem gives options, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 2, but it's stated as 11.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 242, but the GCF is 2, not 11, and the problem has a typo.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing that 350 is 35 *10, and 35 is 5*7, 10 is 2*5. So 350 is 2*5^2*7. And the other number is 242=2*11^2. So, the GCF is 2, LCM is 2^2 *5^2 *7 *11= 4*25 *7*11= 4*25=100, 100*7=700, 700*11=7700. So the LCM is correct, but the GCF is 2, not 11. So the problem must be wrong.\n\nBut since the options include 242, perhaps that's the intended answer, despite the inconsistency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering that 350 must be a multiple of 11. Let me think again. If the GCF is 11, then 11 must be a factor of both numbers. So both numbers must be multiples of 11. But 350 is not a multiple of 11, so there's no solution. Therefore, the problem must be incorrect.\n\nBut since the options are given, perhaps I should proceed with the formula's result, which is 242, even though it doesn't satisfy the GCF condition. So the answer would be option A)242.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial approach. Let me try to find x such that GCF(350, x)=11 and LCM(350, x)=7700.\n\nWe can express x as 11 *k, where k is an integer. Then, since GCF(350, x)=11, 350 and k must be coprime (i.e., GCF(350, k)=1).\n\nThe LCM of 350 and x is 7700. The LCM can be expressed as (350 *x)/GCF(350, x) = (350 *11k)/11 =350*k.\n\nSo, 350*k =7700 \u2192 k=7700/350=22.\n\nSo, k=22. But wait, 22 is 2*11. Now, check if 350 and k=22 are coprime. 350 is 2*5^2*7. 22 is 2*11. So the GCF of 350 and 22 is 2, not 1. Therefore, this approach doesn't work because it would make the GCF 2, not 11.\n\nSo, this suggests that there's no solution, which contradicts the problem statement. Therefore, perhaps the problem has an error, but since I have to choose from the options, perhaps the intended answer is 242.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves finding the other integer when given that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11, their least common multiple (LCM) is 7700, and one of the integers is 350.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about finding the other integer when given the GCF and LCM of two numbers. Hmm, I remember that GCF stands for Greatest Common Factor and LCM is Least Common Multiple. The problem says that the GCF is 11 and the LCM is 7700. One of the numbers is 350, and I need to find the other. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nWait, I think there's a formula that relates GCF and LCM of two numbers. Oh right! The product of the two numbers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM. So if the numbers are a and b, then a * b = GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b). That makes sense because GCF is the greatest common divisor, and LCM is the least common multiple. So I can use this formula to find the missing number.\n\nLet me write that down. So, a * b = GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b). I know a is 350, and the GCF is 11, LCM is 7700. So plugging in the values, 350 * b = 11 * 7700. Wait, what's 11 times 7700? Let me calculate that. 7700 divided by 10 is 770, so 11 times 7700 is 7700 * 10 + 7700 * 1 = 77000 + 7700 = 84700. So 350 * b = 84700.\n\nNow I need to solve for b. So b = 84700 divided by 350. Hmm, let me compute that. Let me see, 350 goes into 84700 how many times? Let's do the division step by step.\n\nFirst, simplify the numbers. Both numerator and denominator can be divided by 50. So 84700 divided by 50 is 1694, and 350 divided by 50 is 7. So now it's 1694 divided by 7. Let's do that division. 7 into 16 is 2, 2*7=14, subtract 16-14=2. Bring down 9, making 29. 7 into 29 is 4, 4*7=28, subtract 29-28=1. Bring down 4, making 14. 7 into 14 is 2, 2*7=14, subtract, 0. So 1694/7 is 242. So b is 242.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that 242 is correct. Let me check the GCF of 350 and 242. The GCF should be 11. Let's factor both numbers.\n\n350: Let's break it down. 350 divided by 2 is 175. 175 divided by 5 is 35. 35 divided by 5 is 7. So 350 is 2 * 5^2 * 7.\n\n242: Let's see, 242 divided by 2 is 121. 121 is 11^2. So 242 is 2 * 11^2.\n\nSo the prime factors of 350 are 2, 5, 5, 7. For 242, it's 2, 11, 11. The common factors are just the 2. Wait, no. Wait, 350 has a 2 and 242 has a 2, so the GCF is 2? But the problem states the GCF is 11. That can't be right. Did I do something wrong?\n\nOh wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check. So, 350 * b = 11 * 7700. 11 *7700 is 84700. So 350 * b = 84700. So b = 84700 /350. Let me calculate that again.\n\nWait, 350 times 242 is 84700? Let me check: 350 * 200 = 70,000. 350 *42 is 14,700. So 70,000 +14,700=84,700. Yes, that's correct. So the product is right. But then why is the GCF 2, not 11? That's a problem because the question says the GCF is 11.\n\nHmm, that suggests that either my approach is wrong, or maybe I made a mistake in the factors. Wait, let me re-examine the numbers. Wait, 350 is 2*5^2*7. 242 is 2*11^2. So the common factors are 2, right? So the GCF is 2. But the question says GCF is 11. So that can't be.\n\nSo that means I must have done something wrong in my calculation. Wait, maybe I miscalculated the product. Let me check 11 *7700 again. 7700 times 10 is 77000, plus 7700 is 84700. Yes, that's correct. So 350 *b is 84700, so b is 242. But the GCF is wrong. So maybe I messed up the formula.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the formula isn't just GCF * LCM = a * b? Let me make sure. Oh wait, no, the formula is correct. Because if you have two numbers, their product equals the product of their GCF and LCM. So if I did that correctly, then why is the GCF wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the factors. Let me factor 242 again. 242 divided by 2 is 121. 121 is 11*11. So 242 is 2 * 11^2. 350 is 2*5^2*7. So the GCF is the product of the smallest power of each common prime factor. The primes in 350 are 2,5,7. In 242, they are 2 and 11. So the only common prime is 2. So the GCF is 2. But the problem states the GCF is 11, so that's a contradiction. So something's wrong here.\n\nWait, maybe I used the wrong formula? Let me think again. Oh, wait! The formula is a * b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So if a is 350, b is 242, then 350*242=84700. GCF is 2, LCM is (350*242)/2=42350. But the problem says the LCM is 7700. So that's not matching either.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I did a mistake in calculating 350 *242. Let me compute 350 *242 again. 350 *200 is 70,000. 350 *40 is 14,000. 350 *2 is 700. So 70,000 +14,000=84,000 plus 700 is 84,700. So that's correct.\n\nSo perhaps my approach is wrong. Let me think again. Maybe the formula is correct, but the problem is that the given numbers don't satisfy the GCF condition, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of b.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the GCF is 11, so perhaps I need to find a number such that when multiplied by 350, it gives 11 *7700, and also that the GCF is 11. So maybe the mistake is that I calculated b as 242, but 242's GCF with 350 is 2, not 11. So perhaps I need to adjust my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should factor 350 and 7700 to see what's going on. Let's see.\n\n350 is 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n7700 is 77 * 100. 77 is 7*11, and 100 is 2^2 *5^2. So 7700 is 2^2 *5^2 *7 *11.\n\nThe LCM of the two numbers is 7700, which is the product of the highest powers of all primes present in either number. So the primes involved are 2,5,7,11.\n\nSo, for the two numbers a and b, a is 350 (2 *5^2 *7), and b is something else. The LCM is 2^2 *5^2 *7 *11.\n\nSo the exponents for each prime in the LCM are the maximum of the exponents in a and b.\n\nSo for prime 2: in a it's 1, in LCM it's 2. So in b, it must be 2.\n\nFor prime 5: a has 2, LCM has 2, so b can have up to 2.\n\nFor prime 7: a has 1, LCM has 1, so b can have 0 or 1.\n\nFor prime 11: a has 0, LCM has 1, so b must have 1.\n\nSo, b's prime factors would be 2^2 *5^x *7^y *11^1, where x can be 0,1, or 2, and y can be 0 or 1.\n\nBut the GCF of a and b is 11. The GCF is the product of the minimum exponents of each prime.\n\nSo for each prime:\n\n- For 2: a has 1, b has 2. So min is 1.\n\n- For 5: a has 2, b has x. So min is min(2, x). But the GCF is 11, which is 11^1. So for all other primes, their exponents in GCF must be zero, meaning that in the GCF, the only prime is 11. Therefore, for 2,5,7, the min exponents must be zero. Wait, that can't be right because a and b both have 2 as a factor. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, the GCF is 11, which is 11^1. So for all primes except 11, the minimum exponents between a and b must be zero. That is, for each prime p \u226011, either a has exponent zero or b has exponent zero.\n\nWait, that can't be because a is 350, which has 2,5,7. So in order for the GCF to be 11, the other number b must have zero exponents for 2,5,7. Because a has 2,5,7, and if b has any of those, the GCF would include those as well, which would make the GCF higher than 11.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, for the GCF to be 11, which is a prime, the two numbers must share only the factor 11. So a is 350, which has 2,5,7, but no 11. So the other number, b, must have 11 as a factor, but no factors of 2,5,7. Because if b had any of those, the GCF would include them.\n\nWait, but wait, a is 350, which is 2 *5^2 *7. So if b has any of those primes (2,5,7), the GCF would include them, which would make the GCF higher than 11. So to have GCF 11, b must have 11 as a factor but must not have 2,5, or 7 as factors.\n\nSo, that means b must be a multiple of 11, but not a multiple of 2,5, or7.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation gave me b=242, which is 2 *11^2. So that's a problem because it has a factor of 2, which would make the GCF of a and b include 2. But the GCF is supposed to be 11.\n\nSo I must have messed up my initial approach. So perhaps the formula isn't sufficient, or I need to apply it differently.\n\nWait, maybe the formula a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b) is correct, but I have to ensure that the numbers a and b also satisfy the GCF condition. So using the formula gave me a number b=242, but that doesn't satisfy the GCF condition. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's let the two numbers be 350 and x. GCF(350, x) =11, and LCM(350, x)=7700.\n\nSo, 350 can be written as 350 = 2 * 5^2 *7. And x can be written as x = 11 * k, where k is an integer that doesn't share any common factors with 350/11's factors. Wait, because GCF is 11, which is a prime, so x must be a multiple of 11, but not share any other prime factors with 350.\n\nSo, x =11 * m, where m is an integer that is co-prime with 350/11. Wait, but 350 is 2*5^2*7, so 350 is not a multiple of 11. So, the GCF(350, x)=11 implies that x is a multiple of 11, and that 11 is the only common prime factor between 350 and x. So, m must be co-prime with 350, meaning m must not have factors of 2,5,7.\n\nNow, the LCM of 350 and x is 7700. Let's express 7700 in terms of its prime factors. 7700 is 77 * 100, which is 7*11 * 2^2 *5^2. So, 7700=2^2 *5^2 *7 *11.\n\nThe LCM of two numbers is the product of the highest powers of all primes present in either number. So, 350 is 2^1 *5^2 *7^1, and x is 11^1 * m. So, the LCM would be the max exponents:\n\n- For 2: max(1, exponent in x). Since x is 11*m and m can't have 2, so exponent of 2 in x is 0. So max is 1.\n\nWait, but wait, the LCM is given as 7700, which has 2^2. So that's a problem. Because 350 has 2^1, and x has 2^0 (since m can't have 2), so the max would be 1. But the LCM is 2^2. So this suggests that x must have 2^2, which contradicts the earlier condition that m can't have factors of 2, because x is 11*m, and m can't have 2 as a factor.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nLet me think again: since the GCF is 11, which is a prime, the two numbers must be of the form 11 * a and 11 * b, where a and b are co-prime (i.e., GCF(a,b)=1).\n\nBecause if they had any other common factors, the GCF would be higher than 11.\n\nSo, let me set 350 as 11 * a, but wait, 350 divided by 11 is approximately 31.818, which is not an integer. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. So that approach won't work because one of the numbers isn't a multiple of 11. Hmm.\n\nWait, but if the GCF is 11, then both numbers must be multiples of 11. Because GCF is the greatest common factor, so if 11 is a factor of both, then both must be multiples of 11. But 350 isn't a multiple of 11. So that's a problem.\n\nWait a minute, 350 divided by 11 is 350/11=31.818, which is not an integer. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. That can't be, because if the GCF of 350 and x is 11, then 11 must divide both numbers. So 350 must be divisible by 11. But 350 isn't. So that suggests that there's a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no, the problem says that one of the numbers is 350, and the GCF is 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11. Let me check that again. 350 divided by 11: 11 *31 is 341, 350-341=9, so 350=11*31 +9. So remainder 9, so 350 is not a multiple of 11. That's impossible because if the GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11, which it's not. That suggests that there's no solution. But the problem gives options, so that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me re-calculate 350 divided by 11. 11 *31 is 341. 350 minus 341 is 9. So 350 =11*31 +9. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. Therefore, the GCF of 350 and any other number can't be 11. Because 350 isn't divisible by 11, so 11 can't be a common factor.\n\nBut the problem states that the GCF is 11. That's a contradiction. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, or perhaps I've made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the formula. Let me go back. The formula says a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So if a is 350, b is x, then 350 * x = 11 *7700 =84700. So x=84700/350=242. So x is 242. But as I saw earlier, 242 is 2*11^2, and 350 is 2*5^2*7. So the GCF is 2, not 11. So that's a problem.\n\nSo, according to the formula, the other number is 242, but that doesn't satisfy the GCF condition. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is correct, but perhaps the problem has a typo, or I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of 350 as a multiple of 11. But it's not.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the product. Let me check 350 *242 again. 350 *200=70000, 350*42=14700. 70000+14700=84700. Yes, that's correct. So the product is correct. But the GCF is 2, not 11.\n\nSo, given that, the problem must have an error. But the problem gives options, so perhaps I should re-examine my earlier steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is only valid when the two numbers are co-prime with their own factors. Or maybe I'm missing a condition.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula a*b=GCF(a,b)*LCM(a,b) is correct, but when GCF is 11, and one of the numbers is 350, which isn't a multiple of 11, then the other number must be a multiple of 11, but the product would require that 350 is a multiple of 11, which it isn't. Therefore, there must be no solution, but the problem gives options, so that's not possible.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the initial approach. Let me try a different method. Let me suppose that the two numbers are 350 and x. Their GCF is 11, so 11 must divide both. So 350 must be a multiple of 11. But as I saw earlier, 350 divided by 11 is 31.818, which is not an integer. Therefore, this is impossible. So there's no such integer x that satisfies the conditions.\n\nBut the problem gives options, so that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that both numbers must be multiples of the GCF. Because the GCF is 11, which is a prime, both numbers must be multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11, but it's not. Therefore, the problem must be wrong, or perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps 350 is a multiple of 11. Let me check again. 11 *31=341. 341 +11=352, which is 11*32. So 350 is between 341 and 352. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. Therefore, this is impossible.\n\nWait, but then the problem must have an error. But since the options are given, perhaps the correct approach is to proceed with the formula, even though it leads to a GCF that doesn't match. But that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think that the other number is a multiple of 11, but not share any other factors with 350. So, since the GCF is 11, the other number x must be a multiple of 11, but must not share any other prime factors with 350.\n\nSo, x=11 *k, where k is an integer that is co-prime with 350/11. Wait, 350 is 2*5^2*7, so 350 and x must share only 11 as a common factor.\n\nSo, the LCM of 350 and x is 7700. Let's compute the LCM in terms of x. Since x=11*k and k is co-prime with 350, the LCM of 350 and x would be 350 *x / GCF(350, x). But GCF(350, x) is 11. So LCM = (350 * x)/11.\n\nWe are given that LCM is 7700. So,\n\n(350 *x)/11 =7700\n\nMultiply both sides by 11:\n\n350 *x =7700 *11\n\nCompute 7700 *11: 7700 *10=77000, plus 7700=84700.\n\nSo 350 *x=84700 \u2192 x=84700/350=242, as before.\n\nBut x=242, which is 2*11^2. So, 242 shares a factor of 2 with 350, which has 2 as a prime factor. Therefore, the GCF of 350 and 242 is 2, not 11. So this contradicts the given condition.\n\nTherefore, there's no solution, but the problem gives options, so perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is being misapplied. Let me think again. The formula a*b = GCF(a,b)*LCM(a,b) is correct. So, given that, the only possible value for x is 242. But that doesn't satisfy the GCF condition. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a mistake, but since the options include 242 as option A, perhaps that's the intended answer, despite the inconsistency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the prime factors. Let me check 350 and 242 again.\n\n350: 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242: 2 *11^2.\n\nSo the common factors are 2, so GCF is 2. So this can't be the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the question was supposed to have a GCF of 2, but that's not what's stated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think differently. Maybe I should express both numbers in terms of their GCF.\n\nSo, since GCF is 11, I can write the numbers as 11*a and 11*b, where a and b are coprime integers (i.e., their GCF is 1). Then, the LCM of the two numbers would be 11*a*b, because LCM of 11a and 11b is 11*LCM(a,b) =11*a*b, since a and b are coprime.\n\nSo, given that, the LCM is 7700, so 11*a*b=7700 \u2192 a*b=7700/11=700.\n\nOne of the numbers is 350, which is 11*a. So 11*a=350 \u2192 a=350/11 \u224831.818, which is not an integer. So that's impossible. Therefore, there's no solution.\n\nWait, but that's impossible because the problem gives options. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but since I have to choose from the options, perhaps the intended answer is 242, even though it's incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that both numbers must be multiples of the GCF. Because if the GCF is 11, then both numbers must be multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11, but it's not. Therefore, the problem is impossible, but the options suggest that 242 is the answer.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me factor 7700 into its prime factors again. 7700=77*100=7*11 *2^2 *5^2.\n\nThe LCM of 350 and x is 7700. So, 350 is 2*5^2*7. So the LCM must have the maximum exponents of each prime present in either number.\n\nSo, for 2: max between 350's 2^1 and x's 2^k.\n\nFor 5: max between 5^2 and x's 5^m.\n\nFor 7: max between 7^1 and x's 7^n.\n\nFor 11: max between 11^0 (since 350 has no 11) and x's 11^p.\n\nThe LCM has 2^2,5^2,7^1,11^1.\n\nSo, for 2: x must have 2^2, because 350 has 2^1. So x must have 2^2.\n\nFor 5: x can have up to 5^2, but since the LCM has 5^2, x can have 5^0,5^1, or 5^2.\n\nFor 7: x can have up to 7^1, but the LCM has 7^1, so x can have 7^0 or 7^1.\n\nFor 11: x must have 11^1, because the LCM has 11^1 and 350 has none.\n\nSo, x must be 2^2 *5^a *7^b *11^1, where a is 0,1,2 and b is 0 or1.\n\nBut the GCF of 350 and x must be 11.\n\nThe GCF is the product of the minimum exponents of each prime.\n\nSo, for each prime:\n\n- 2: min(1,2)=1 \u2192 contributes 2^1.\n\n- 5: min(2, a) \u2192 must be 0, because GCF is 11 (which is 11^1), so the other primes' exponents must be 0. Therefore, min(2, a) must be 0. So a must be 0.\n\n- 7: min(1, b) \u2192 must be 0. So b must be 0.\n\n- 11: min(0,1)=0 \u2192 but wait, 350 has 0 exponent for 11, so the min is 0. But we need the GCF to be 11, which is 11^1. That's a problem.\n\nWait, no. Because the GCF is 11, which is 11^1. So for the GCF to be 11, all other primes' exponents must be zero. So:\n\n- For 2: min(1, 2) =1 \u2192 which would mean the GCF includes 2^1. But the GCF is supposed to be 11, which doesn't include 2. Therefore, this is impossible.\n\nSo, this suggests that there's no solution, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nBut the problem gives options, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 2, but it's stated as 11.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 242, but the GCF is 2, not 11, and the problem has a typo.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing that 350 is 35 *10, and 35 is 5*7, 10 is 2*5. So 350 is 2*5^2*7. And the other number is 242=2*11^2. So, the GCF is 2, LCM is 2^2 *5^2 *7 *11= 4*25 *7*11= 4*25=100, 100*7=700, 700*11=7700. So the LCM is correct, but the GCF is 2, not 11. So the problem must be wrong.\n\nBut since the options include 242, perhaps that's the intended answer, despite the inconsistency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering that 350 must be a multiple of 11. Let me think again. If the GCF is 11, then 11 must be a factor of both numbers. So both numbers must be multiples of 11. But 350 is not a multiple of 11, so there's no solution. Therefore, the problem must be incorrect.\n\nBut since the options are given, perhaps I should proceed with the formula's result, which is 242, even though it doesn't satisfy the GCF condition. So the answer would be option A)242.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial approach. Let me try to find x such that GCF(350, x)=11 and LCM(350, x)=7700.\n\nWe can express x as 11 *k, where k is an integer. Then, since GCF(350, x)=11, 350 and k must be coprime (i.e., GCF(350, k)=1).\n\nThe LCM of 350 and x is 7700. The LCM can be expressed as (350 *x)/GCF(350, x) = (350 *11k)/11 =350*k.\n\nSo, 350*k =7700 \u2192 k=7700/350=22.\n\nSo, k=22. But wait, 22 is 2*11. Now, check if 350 and k=22 are coprime. 350 is 2*5^2*7. 22 is 2*11. So the GCF of 350 and 22 is 2, not 1. Therefore, this approach doesn't work because it would make the GCF 2, not 11.\n\nSo, this suggests that there's no solution, which contradicts the problem statement. Therefore, perhaps the problem has an error, but since I have to choose from the options, perhaps the intended answer is 242.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the other integer when given that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11, their least common multiple (LCM) is 7700, and one of the integers is 350. The relationship between GCF and LCM is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\na \\times b = \\text{GCF}(a, b) \\times \\text{LCM}(a, b)\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(a = 350\\), \\(\\text{GCF}(a, b) = 11\\), and \\(\\text{LCM}(a, b) = 7700\\). Substituting these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n350 \\times b = 11 \\times 7700\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(11 \\times 7700\\):\n\n\\[\n11 \\times 7700 = 84700\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\n350 \\times b = 84700 \\implies b = \\frac{84700}{350} = 242\n\\]\n\nNext, verify if \\(b = 242\\) satisfies the GCF condition. Factorizing both numbers:\n\n- \\(350 = 2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7\\)\n- \\(242 = 2 \\times 11^2\\)\n\nThe GCF is the product of the smallest powers of common prime factors. The only common prime factor is \\(2\\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\text{GCF}(350, 242) = 2\n\\]\n\nThis contradicts the given GCF of 11. Therefore, \\(b = 242\\) does not satisfy the GCF condition. However, since the problem provides options and the formula yields \\(b = 242\\), it appears the problem assumes this result despite the inconsistency.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n**Answer: A**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it again.\n\nThe question says that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11. Their least common multiple (LCM) is 7700. One of the integers is 350, and I need to find the other integer. The options are A to E.\n\nHmm, I remember that GCF and LCM have some relationship with the product of the two numbers. Let me think. Oh right! The product of the two numbers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM. So, if I call the two numbers a and b, then a * b = GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b). That's the formula I should use here.\n\nSo, given that GCF is 11 and LCM is 7700, and one number is 350, I can plug these into the formula. Let me write that down.\n\nLet a = 350, and b = the unknown number. Then:\n\n350 * b = 11 * 7700\n\nWait, let me compute the right side first. 11 multiplied by 7700. Hmm, 7700 divided by 11 is 700, right? Because 11 times 700 is 7700. So 11 * 7700 is 7700 * 11, which is 84700. So 350 * b = 84700.\n\nNow, I can solve for b by dividing both sides by 350. So b = 84700 / 350.\n\nLet me do that division. Let's see, 84700 divided by 350. I can simplify this fraction. Both numerator and denominator can be divided by 10 first, so that gives 8470 / 35.\n\nHmm, what's 8470 divided by 35? Let me see. 35 times 242 is 8470 because 35 * 200 is 7000, and 35 * 42 is 1470. 7000 + 1470 is 8470. So 8470 divided by 35 is 242. So b is 242. \n\nWait, but wait a minute. I should check if this makes sense because sometimes when you have GCF and LCM, the numbers have to satisfy certain conditions. Let me make sure that 11 is indeed the GCF of 350 and 242.\n\nSo, to find the GCF, I can factor both numbers.\n\nFactorizing 350: 350 is 35 * 10, which is 5*7 * 2*5. So the prime factors are 2, 5^2, and 7.\n\nFactorizing 242: 242 is an even number, so divided by 2 is 121. 121 is 11 squared. So 242 is 2 * 11^2.\n\nSo the common factors are the primes they share. Let's see, 350 has 2,5,7. 242 has 2 and 11. The only common prime is 2, but wait, wait, wait. Wait, the GCF is given as 11, but according to this, the GCF would be 2, right? Because both have a 2 as a prime factor.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because according to the problem statement, the GCF is 11, but when I calculated the other number as 242, the GCF of 350 and 242 is 2, not 11. So that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nHmm. Maybe I miscalculated the other number. Let me go back.\n\nWait, the formula is a*b = GCF * LCM. So 350 * b = 11 * 7700. Let me recalculate 11 * 7700.\n\nWait, 7700 * 11. Let me compute that. 7700 * 10 is 77,000. Plus 7700 is 84,700. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo 350 * b = 84,700. So b = 84,700 / 350. Let me compute that again. 350 into 84700.\n\nWait, 350 * 200 is 70,000. 84,700 -70,000 is 14,700. 350 * 40 is 14,000. So 200+40=240, and 14,700-14,000=700. 350 * 2=700. So 240+2=242. So yes, 242 is correct. But that leads to a GCF of 2, which contradicts the given GCF of 11. So something's wrong.\n\nWait, did I do the factoring correctly? Let me check 350 again. 350 = 2 * 5^2 * 7. Correct. 242 is 2 * 11^2. So the common prime factor is 2. So GCF is 2, not 11. So that can't be. So my calculation is correct, but the answer can't be 242 because that would make the GCF 2, not 11.\n\nHmm. So I must have made a wrong assumption. Maybe the formula is different? Or perhaps I messed up the formula.\n\nWait, wait, no. The formula is correct. The product is equal to GCF times LCM. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 350 * b = 11 * 7700. Let me compute 11*7700 again. 7700 * 11 is 84,700. Yes.\n\n350 into 84,700. Let me try dividing 84,700 by 350.\n\nAlternatively, let's see. 350 is 35 * 10. So 84,700 divided by 35 is... Let me compute 84,700 / 35.\n\n35 * 2400 is 84,000. 84,700 -84,000 = 700. 700 /35=20. So 2400+20=2420. So 84,700 /350 is 2420/10=242. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, so why is the GCF 2, not 11? Because 350 is 2 *5^2 *7, and 242 is 2*11^2. So the GCF is the product of the minimum exponents of the common primes. So the only common prime is 2, with exponent 1. So GCF is 2. But the problem says GCF is 11. So that's a problem.\n\nSo my initial approach must be wrong. Hmm. So perhaps the formula is applied differently when considering the GCF.\n\nWait, maybe I should express the numbers in terms of their GCF. Because the GCF is 11, that suggests that both numbers are multiples of 11. Wait, but 350 is not a multiple of 11. Because 350 divided by 11 is approximately 31.818, which is not an integer. Wait, that's a problem. Because if the GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11.\n\nWait a minute, that can't be right. Because 350 isn't a multiple of 11. 11 times 31 is 341, and 11 times 32 is 352. So 350 isn't a multiple of 11. That suggests that either the problem is wrong, or I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, but the problem says the GCF is 11. So both numbers must be multiples of 11. Because the GCF is 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11. But 350 divided by 11 is not an integer. So that's a contradiction. So either I'm missing something here, or the problem is incorrect.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's numbers. Let me check the problem again.\n\nWait, the problem says that the GCF is 11, LCM is 7700, and one integer is 350. So if 350 isn't a multiple of 11, then this situation can't happen. Because GCF is 11, so both numbers must be multiples of 11.\n\nSo that suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in my initial formula.\n\nWait, wait, no, the formula is correct. Let me think again. So the formula is that the product of the two numbers equals the product of their GCF and LCM.\n\nBut if the GCF is 11, then both numbers must be multiples of 11. So if one of the numbers is 350, which isn't a multiple of 11, that's impossible. So perhaps I've made a miscalculation. Because that can't be.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is designed incorrectly. Or perhaps I'm missing a key point.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the math again. Let me compute 350 divided by 11.\n\n350 /11. 11 times 31 is 341. 350-341=9. So 350 is 31*11 +9, which is 31.818... So 350 isn't a multiple of 11. So this can't be.\n\nBut the problem says that the GCF is 11. So both numbers must be multiples of 11. Hence, 350 must be a multiple of 11. But it's not. So that suggests that the problem is impossible as stated.\n\nWait, but the problem is given, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding it. Let me read it again.\n\nWait, the question says, the greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. One of the integers is 350. So perhaps I'm miscalculating 350's divisibility by 11.\n\nLet me check 350 again. 350 divided by 11: 11 *31=341, 350-341=9. So no. So 350 is not a multiple of 11.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the GCF can't be 11 because 350 isn't a multiple of 11. So this suggests that either the problem is wrong, or I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, let me think again. The formula is a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So perhaps the product of the two numbers is 11*7700=84700. So 350*b=84700. So b=242.\n\nBut then, as before, the GCF is 2, not 11. So that's impossible.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is correct, but I'm missing something about the GCF. Let me re-express the two numbers.\n\nSince GCF is 11, let me write the two numbers as 11*m and 11*n, where m and n are integers that are coprime (their GCF is 1). Because if they had a common factor greater than 1, then the GCF would be higher than 11.\n\nSo, a = 11*m, b=11*n. Then, the LCM of a and b is (a*b)/GCF(a,b) = (11m *11n)/11 = 11 m n. Because m and n are coprime.\n\nBut the LCM is given as 7700. So 11 m n =7700. So m n = 7700 /11=700. So m *n=700.\n\nNow, one of the numbers is 350. Let's say a=350=11*m. So m=350/11. But 350 divided by 11 is about 31.818, which isn't an integer. So that's a problem. Because m has to be an integer. So that's impossible. Therefore, perhaps the other number is 11*n=350. So n=350/11=31.818... Again, not an integer.\n\nSo this suggests that both a and b can't be written as 11*m and 11*n if one of them is 350. Because 350 isn't a multiple of 11. So that's impossible.\n\nWait, so this suggests that the problem is incorrect because it's impossible for the GCF of 350 and another number to be 11 when 350 isn't a multiple of 11. So perhaps the options have a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should find the other number by considering that the GCF is 11. So 350 and the other number share a factor of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11. But it's not. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is correct, and I'm missing something else. Let me try to compute the GCF of 350 and 242. Wait, 350 is 2*5^2*7, 242 is 2*11^2. So the GCF is 2, as I thought earlier. So that's not 11. So that can't be the answer.\n\nSo none of the options seem to fit because when I compute the other number as 242, the GCF is 2, which doesn't match the given 11.\n\nSo perhaps I'm missing a key insight here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach the problem differently. Let's think about the formula again.\n\nThe product of the two numbers is GCF * LCM. So 350 * b = 11 *7700 = 84700. So b=84700/350=242. So the other number is 242. But as we saw, that makes the GCF 2, not 11. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the formula. Wait, the formula is correct. So what's happening here?\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if 242 is a multiple of 11. Because 242 divided by 11 is 22, right? 11*22=242. So yes, 242 is a multiple of 11. But 350 isn't.\n\nWait, but if the GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11, but it's not. So that's impossible. So perhaps the problem is wrong.\n\nBut the problem is given, so perhaps I've made a mistake in calculation. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the GCF of 350 and 242 again.\n\nSo, 350 and 242.\n\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm:\n\nGCF(350, 242) = GCF(242, 350 mod 242).\n\n350 divided by 242 is 1, remainder 108.\n\nSo GCF(242, 108).\n\n242 divided by 108 is 2, remainder 26.\n\nGCF(108,26).\n\n108 divided by 26 is 4, remainder 4.\n\nGCF(26,4).\n\n26 divided by 4 is 6, remainder 2.\n\nGCF(4,2).\n\n4 divided by 2 is 2, remainder 0. So GCF is 2.\n\nSo yes, the GCF is 2. So that's not 11.\n\nSo that suggests that 242 is not the correct answer because it doesn't satisfy the GCF condition.\n\nHmm. So what's wrong here? Because according to the formula, the other number should be 242, but it doesn't fit the GCF condition.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the problem using the formula with the GCF.\n\nSo, the formula is a * b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b).\n\nGiven that GCF is 11, and LCM is 7700, and a is 350.\n\nSo, 350 * b = 11 *7700 = 84700.\n\nSo b=242.\n\nBut then, the GCF of 350 and 242 is 2, not 11. So that's a contradiction.\n\nHmm. So maybe the problem is wrong, or I've misunderstood the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is correct, and I should look for a different approach. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula I'm using is correct, but I should consider that when the GCF is 11, the two numbers can be written as 11k and 11m, where k and m are coprime.\n\nSo, let me write the two numbers as a=11k and b=11m, where GCF(k,m)=1.\n\nThen, the LCM of a and b would be 11 * k * m, because since k and m are coprime, their LCM is k*m.\n\nSo, LCM(a,b)=11*k*m.\n\nGiven that LCM is 7700, so 11*k*m=7700.\n\nSo, k*m =7700/11=700.\n\nNow, one of the numbers is 350. So either a=11k=350, which implies k=350/11\u224831.818, which isn't an integer. So that's not possible. Or, b=11m=350 \u2192 m=350/11\u224831.818, which also isn't an integer. So that's impossible.\n\nSo that suggests that the problem is impossible because neither a nor b can be 350 if the GCF is 11. Because 350 isn't a multiple of 11, so both a and b have to be multiples of 11 for their GCF to be 11.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I'm missing something.\n\nWait, but the options include 242, which I calculated. But that leads to GCF of 2, not 11.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is designed incorrectly. But since the problem is given, I have to proceed. Maybe the correct answer is 242, but the GCF condition is a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in calculations.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let's compute the GCF of 350 and each option, and see which one has GCF 11 and LCM 7700.\n\nWait, that's a lot of work, but perhaps manageable.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)242\n\nB)308\n\nC)352\n\nD)412\n\nE)456\n\nLet me compute GCF of 350 and each option, and check if the LCM is 7700.\n\nStarting with option A:242.\n\nAs before, GCF(350,242)=2. So no, not 11.\n\nOption B:308.\n\nCompute GCF(350,308).\n\nUsing Euclidean algorithm:\n\n350 divided by 308 is 1, remainder 42.\n\nGCF(308,42).\n\n308 \u00f742 = 7, remainder 14.\n\nGCF(42,14)=14. So the GCF is 14. Not 11.\n\nSo option B is out.\n\nOption C:352.\n\nCompute GCF(350,352).\n\n352 is even, 350 is even, so GCF is at least 2.\n\n352 \u00f7350=1, remainder 2.\n\nGCF(350,2)=2.\n\nSo GCF is 2. Not 11.\n\nOption D:412.\n\nCompute GCF(350,412).\n\n350 \u00f7412=0, so remainder is 350.\n\nGCF(412,350).\n\n412 \u00f7350=1, remainder 62.\n\nGCF(350,62).\n\n350 \u00f762=5, remainder 40.\n\nGCF(62,40).\n\n62 \u00f740=1, remainder 22.\n\nGCF(40,22).\n\n40 \u00f722=1, remainder 18.\n\nGCF(22,18).\n\n22 \u00f718=1, remainder 4.\n\nGCF(18,4).\n\n18 \u00f74=4, remainder 2.\n\nGCF(4,2)=2.\n\nSo GCF is 2. Not 11.\n\nOption E:456.\n\nCompute GCF(350,456).\n\n456 \u00f7350=1, remainder 106.\n\nGCF(350,106).\n\n350 \u00f7106=3, remainder 32 (106*3=318, 350-318=32).\n\nGCF(106,32).\n\n106 \u00f732=3, remainder 10.\n\nGCF(32,10)=2.\n\nSo GCF is 2. Not 11.\n\nSo none of the options have a GCF of 11 with 350. So that suggests that the problem is impossible as given.\n\nBut that can't be right because the problem is presented as a valid question. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reconsider the formula. Let me think again.\n\nThe formula is a * b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So 350 * b = 11 *7700=84700. So b=242.\n\nBut when I compute the GCF of 350 and 242, it's 2. So that's a problem. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's not possible because the options are given.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the formula is correct. So the other number must be 242. But 242 isn't in the options except option A. So perhaps the correct answer is A)242, even though it doesn't satisfy the GCF condition. But that can't be right because the GCF is given as 11.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 2, but that's not what the problem states.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the LCM for 350 and 242. Let's compute LCM(350,242).\n\nThe LCM is (350*242)/GCF(350,242) = (350*242)/2 = (350/2)*242 = 175 *242.\n\nCompute 175 *242. Let's see: 175 *200=35,000; 175 *42=7,350. So total is 42,350. But the problem states that LCM is 7700, which is much smaller. So that's not matching.\n\nSo that suggests that the other number can't be 242 because the LCM would be 42,350, which is way larger than 7700.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, the product should be 84700, but the LCM is 7700. So perhaps the numbers are 11 and 700, because 11 *700=7700. Wait, no, that's not right.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let me compute the LCM of 350 and 242.\n\nWait, 350=2*5^2*7, 242=2*11^2.\n\nThe LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes present. So primes are 2,5,7,11.\n\nSo LCM is 2^1 *5^2 *7^1 *11^2= 2*25*7*121.\n\nCompute that: 2*25=50; 50*7=350; 350 *121=42,350. Which is way bigger than 7700.\n\nSo that's not matching the given LCM of 7700.\n\nSo that suggests that the other number isn't 242. But according to the formula, it should be.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let me think if there's another way.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I'm not considering that the two numbers can be written as 11k and 11m, where k and m are coprime. So, given that, let me try to find such numbers where one is 350, but that seems impossible because 350 isn't a multiple of 11.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem has a typo. Maybe the LCM is 42,350, not 7700, but that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So I have to make sure that both a and b are multiples of the GCF.\n\nBut 350 isn't a multiple of 11, so perhaps the problem is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is correct, and I'm misunderstanding the GCF.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is correct, and the other number is 242, and I'm miscalculating the GCF. Let me check again.\n\n350 factors: 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242 factors: 2 *11^2.\n\nSo the common factors are 2, so GCF is 2. So that's correct.\n\nSo, I'm stuck. According to the formula, the other number is 242, but that doesn't satisfy the GCF condition. So the problem is impossible as given. But that can't be because the problem is presented as a valid question.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the GCF is 11, but one of the numbers is 350, which isn't a multiple of 11. That's impossible. So the problem is wrong.\n\nBut since the options don't have any other number, perhaps the intended answer is 242, despite the GCF being 2. But that's not acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should re-express the problem. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is correct, and I'm missing a key point. Let me try to find the other number.\n\nGiven that GCF is 11, so both numbers are multiples of 11. Let me write them as 11a and 11b, where a and b are coprime (their GCF is 1).\n\nThen, LCM(11a,11b) = 11a*b, since a and b are coprime.\n\nGiven that LCM is 7700, so 11ab=7700 \u2192 ab=700.\n\nNow, one of the numbers is 350, which is 11a=350 \u2192 a=350/11\u224831.818, which isn't an integer. So that's impossible. So the other number is 11b=350 \u2192 b=350/11\u224831.818, which isn't an integer. So again, impossible.\n\nThus, the problem is impossible because neither a nor b can be integers, given that one of the numbers is 350. So the problem is incorrect.\n\nBut since this is a multiple-choice question, perhaps the intended answer is 242, even though it's mathematically incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.\n\nThe formula is correct. So, perhaps the other number is 242, but the GCF is 2, which contradicts the problem statement. So that suggests that the problem has no solution.\n\nBut the problem states that such numbers exist, so perhaps I've made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So 350*b=11*7700=84700 \u2192 b=242. But then, the GCF is 2, not 11.\n\nSo the only way this could work is if the problem has a mistake. But perhaps I should proceed with the answer as 242, even though it's mathematically inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if any of the other options satisfy the conditions when paired with 350.\n\nLet's check each option:\n\nOption A:242.\n\nAs before, GCF is 2, LCM is 42350. Doesn't match.\n\nOption B:308.\n\nCompute GCF(350,308). Let's see.\n\n350 \u00f7308=1, remainder 42.\n\n308 \u00f742=7, remainder 14.\n\n42 \u00f714=3, remainder 0. So GCF is 14.\n\nNow, compute LCM(350,308) = (350*308)/14.\n\n350 \u00f714=25. 308 \u00f714=22. So 25*308=7700. Wait, 25 * 308 is 7700.\n\nWait, yes! Because 25 * 308 = 7700. So the LCM is 7700.\n\nSo the GCF is 14, which doesn't match the given GCF of 11. So option B is not correct.\n\nWait, but the LCM matches. Hmm.\n\nWait, so for option B, the LCM is correct, but the GCF is 14, not 11.\n\nSo that's not acceptable.\n\nOption C:352.\n\nCompute GCF(350,352).\n\n352 is even, 350 is even. So GCF is at least 2.\n\n352 \u00f7350=1, remainder 2.\n\nSo GCF(350,2)=2.\n\nSo GCF is 2.\n\nCompute LCM(350,352) = (350 *352)/2 = (350/2)*352 =175 *352.\n\nCompute that: 175 *352.\n\nWell, 175 *300=52,500; 175*52=9,100. So total is 61,600.\n\nWhich is way larger than 7700. So not acceptable.\n\nOption D:412.\n\nCompute GCF(350,412).\n\nAs before, the GCF is 2.\n\nCompute LCM(350,412) = (350*412)/2 = 350*206 = let's compute that.\n\n350*200=70,000. 350*6=2,100. So total is 72,100. Not 7700.\n\nOption E:456.\n\nCompute GCF(350,456).\n\nAs before, GCF is 2.\n\nCompute LCM: (350 *456)/2 = 350 *228.\n\n350*200=70,000; 350*28=9,800. So total 79,800. Not 7700.\n\nSo none of the options satisfy both the GCF=11 and LCM=7700 when paired with 350.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the problem is incorrect. But since the options are given, perhaps the intended answer is 242, even though it's mathematically inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 2, but that's not what it says.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says the GCF is 11, LCM is 7700, and one integer is 350. So according to the formula, the other must be 242, but that doesn't have GCF 11.\n\nSo perhaps the answer is 242, but the problem is incorrect. Or perhaps I've made a mistake in calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recompute the GCF of 350 and 242.\n\nUsing prime factors:\n\n350 = 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242 = 2 * 11^2.\n\nCommon prime: 2. So GCF is 2.\n\nSo the only possible conclusion is that the problem is incorrect, but the intended answer is 242, option A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem states that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11, their least common multiple (LCM) is 7700, and one of the integers is 350.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it again.\n\nThe question says that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11. Their least common multiple (LCM) is 7700. One of the integers is 350, and I need to find the other integer. The options are A to E.\n\nHmm, I remember that GCF and LCM have some relationship with the product of the two numbers. Let me think. Oh right! The product of the two numbers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM. So, if I call the two numbers a and b, then a * b = GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b). That's the formula I should use here.\n\nSo, given that GCF is 11 and LCM is 7700, and one number is 350, I can plug these into the formula. Let me write that down.\n\nLet a = 350, and b = the unknown number. Then:\n\n350 * b = 11 * 7700\n\nWait, let me compute the right side first. 11 multiplied by 7700. Hmm, 7700 divided by 11 is 700, right? Because 11 times 700 is 7700. So 11 * 7700 is 7700 * 11, which is 84700. So 350 * b = 84700.\n\nNow, I can solve for b by dividing both sides by 350. So b = 84700 / 350.\n\nLet me do that division. Let's see, 84700 divided by 350. I can simplify this fraction. Both numerator and denominator can be divided by 10 first, so that gives 8470 / 35.\n\nHmm, what's 8470 divided by 35? Let me see. 35 times 242 is 8470 because 35 * 200 is 7000, and 35 * 42 is 1470. 7000 + 1470 is 8470. So 8470 divided by 35 is 242. So b is 242. \n\nWait, but wait a minute. I should check if this makes sense because sometimes when you have GCF and LCM, the numbers have to satisfy certain conditions. Let me make sure that 11 is indeed the GCF of 350 and 242.\n\nSo, to find the GCF, I can factor both numbers.\n\nFactorizing 350: 350 is 35 * 10, which is 5*7 * 2*5. So the prime factors are 2, 5^2, and 7.\n\nFactorizing 242: 242 is an even number, so divided by 2 is 121. 121 is 11 squared. So 242 is 2 * 11^2.\n\nSo the common factors are the primes they share. Let's see, 350 has 2,5,7. 242 has 2 and 11. The only common prime is 2, but wait, wait, wait. Wait, the GCF is given as 11, but according to this, the GCF would be 2, right? Because both have a 2 as a prime factor.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because according to the problem statement, the GCF is 11, but when I calculated the other number as 242, the GCF of 350 and 242 is 2, not 11. So that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nHmm. Maybe I miscalculated the other number. Let me go back.\n\nWait, the formula is a*b = GCF * LCM. So 350 * b = 11 * 7700. Let me recalculate 11 * 7700.\n\nWait, 7700 * 11. Let me compute that. 7700 * 10 is 77,000. Plus 7700 is 84,700. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo 350 * b = 84,700. So b = 84,700 / 350. Let me compute that again. 350 into 84700.\n\nWait, 350 * 200 is 70,000. 84,700 -70,000 is 14,700. 350 * 40 is 14,000. So 200+40=240, and 14,700-14,000=700. 350 * 2=700. So 240+2=242. So yes, 242 is correct. But that leads to a GCF of 2, which contradicts the given GCF of 11. So something's wrong.\n\nWait, did I do the factoring correctly? Let me check 350 again. 350 = 2 * 5^2 * 7. Correct. 242 is 2 * 11^2. So the common prime factor is 2. So GCF is 2, not 11. So that can't be. So my calculation is correct, but the answer can't be 242 because that would make the GCF 2, not 11.\n\nHmm. So I must have made a wrong assumption. Maybe the formula is different? Or perhaps I messed up the formula.\n\nWait, wait, no. The formula is correct. The product is equal to GCF times LCM. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 350 * b = 11 * 7700. Let me compute 11*7700 again. 7700 * 11 is 84,700. Yes.\n\n350 into 84,700. Let me try dividing 84,700 by 350.\n\nAlternatively, let's see. 350 is 35 * 10. So 84,700 divided by 35 is... Let me compute 84,700 / 35.\n\n35 * 2400 is 84,000. 84,700 -84,000 = 700. 700 /35=20. So 2400+20=2420. So 84,700 /350 is 2420/10=242. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, so why is the GCF 2, not 11? Because 350 is 2 *5^2 *7, and 242 is 2*11^2. So the GCF is the product of the minimum exponents of the common primes. So the only common prime is 2, with exponent 1. So GCF is 2. But the problem says GCF is 11. So that's a problem.\n\nSo my initial approach must be wrong. Hmm. So perhaps the formula is applied differently when considering the GCF.\n\nWait, maybe I should express the numbers in terms of their GCF. Because the GCF is 11, that suggests that both numbers are multiples of 11. Wait, but 350 is not a multiple of 11. Because 350 divided by 11 is approximately 31.818, which is not an integer. Wait, that's a problem. Because if the GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11.\n\nWait a minute, that can't be right. Because 350 isn't a multiple of 11. 11 times 31 is 341, and 11 times 32 is 352. So 350 isn't a multiple of 11. That suggests that either the problem is wrong, or I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, but the problem says the GCF is 11. So both numbers must be multiples of 11. Because the GCF is 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11. But 350 divided by 11 is not an integer. So that's a contradiction. So either I'm missing something here, or the problem is incorrect.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's numbers. Let me check the problem again.\n\nWait, the problem says that the GCF is 11, LCM is 7700, and one integer is 350. So if 350 isn't a multiple of 11, then this situation can't happen. Because GCF is 11, so both numbers must be multiples of 11.\n\nSo that suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in my initial formula.\n\nWait, wait, no, the formula is correct. Let me think again. So the formula is that the product of the two numbers equals the product of their GCF and LCM.\n\nBut if the GCF is 11, then both numbers must be multiples of 11. So if one of the numbers is 350, which isn't a multiple of 11, that's impossible. So perhaps I've made a miscalculation. Because that can't be.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is designed incorrectly. Or perhaps I'm missing a key point.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the math again. Let me compute 350 divided by 11.\n\n350 /11. 11 times 31 is 341. 350-341=9. So 350 is 31*11 +9, which is 31.818... So 350 isn't a multiple of 11. So this can't be.\n\nBut the problem says that the GCF is 11. So both numbers must be multiples of 11. Hence, 350 must be a multiple of 11. But it's not. So that suggests that the problem is impossible as stated.\n\nWait, but the problem is given, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding it. Let me read it again.\n\nWait, the question says, the greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. One of the integers is 350. So perhaps I'm miscalculating 350's divisibility by 11.\n\nLet me check 350 again. 350 divided by 11: 11 *31=341, 350-341=9. So no. So 350 is not a multiple of 11.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the GCF can't be 11 because 350 isn't a multiple of 11. So this suggests that either the problem is wrong, or I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, let me think again. The formula is a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So perhaps the product of the two numbers is 11*7700=84700. So 350*b=84700. So b=242.\n\nBut then, as before, the GCF is 2, not 11. So that's impossible.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is correct, but I'm missing something about the GCF. Let me re-express the two numbers.\n\nSince GCF is 11, let me write the two numbers as 11*m and 11*n, where m and n are integers that are coprime (their GCF is 1). Because if they had a common factor greater than 1, then the GCF would be higher than 11.\n\nSo, a = 11*m, b=11*n. Then, the LCM of a and b is (a*b)/GCF(a,b) = (11m *11n)/11 = 11 m n. Because m and n are coprime.\n\nBut the LCM is given as 7700. So 11 m n =7700. So m n = 7700 /11=700. So m *n=700.\n\nNow, one of the numbers is 350. Let's say a=350=11*m. So m=350/11. But 350 divided by 11 is about 31.818, which isn't an integer. So that's a problem. Because m has to be an integer. So that's impossible. Therefore, perhaps the other number is 11*n=350. So n=350/11=31.818... Again, not an integer.\n\nSo this suggests that both a and b can't be written as 11*m and 11*n if one of them is 350. Because 350 isn't a multiple of 11. So that's impossible.\n\nWait, so this suggests that the problem is incorrect because it's impossible for the GCF of 350 and another number to be 11 when 350 isn't a multiple of 11. So perhaps the options have a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should find the other number by considering that the GCF is 11. So 350 and the other number share a factor of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11. But it's not. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is correct, and I'm missing something else. Let me try to compute the GCF of 350 and 242. Wait, 350 is 2*5^2*7, 242 is 2*11^2. So the GCF is 2, as I thought earlier. So that's not 11. So that can't be the answer.\n\nSo none of the options seem to fit because when I compute the other number as 242, the GCF is 2, which doesn't match the given 11.\n\nSo perhaps I'm missing a key insight here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach the problem differently. Let's think about the formula again.\n\nThe product of the two numbers is GCF * LCM. So 350 * b = 11 *7700 = 84700. So b=84700/350=242. So the other number is 242. But as we saw, that makes the GCF 2, not 11. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the formula. Wait, the formula is correct. So what's happening here?\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if 242 is a multiple of 11. Because 242 divided by 11 is 22, right? 11*22=242. So yes, 242 is a multiple of 11. But 350 isn't.\n\nWait, but if the GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11, but it's not. So that's impossible. So perhaps the problem is wrong.\n\nBut the problem is given, so perhaps I've made a mistake in calculation. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the GCF of 350 and 242 again.\n\nSo, 350 and 242.\n\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm:\n\nGCF(350, 242) = GCF(242, 350 mod 242).\n\n350 divided by 242 is 1, remainder 108.\n\nSo GCF(242, 108).\n\n242 divided by 108 is 2, remainder 26.\n\nGCF(108,26).\n\n108 divided by 26 is 4, remainder 4.\n\nGCF(26,4).\n\n26 divided by 4 is 6, remainder 2.\n\nGCF(4,2).\n\n4 divided by 2 is 2, remainder 0. So GCF is 2.\n\nSo yes, the GCF is 2. So that's not 11.\n\nSo that suggests that 242 is not the correct answer because it doesn't satisfy the GCF condition.\n\nHmm. So what's wrong here? Because according to the formula, the other number should be 242, but it doesn't fit the GCF condition.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the problem using the formula with the GCF.\n\nSo, the formula is a * b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b).\n\nGiven that GCF is 11, and LCM is 7700, and a is 350.\n\nSo, 350 * b = 11 *7700 = 84700.\n\nSo b=242.\n\nBut then, the GCF of 350 and 242 is 2, not 11. So that's a contradiction.\n\nHmm. So maybe the problem is wrong, or I've misunderstood the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is correct, and I should look for a different approach. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula I'm using is correct, but I should consider that when the GCF is 11, the two numbers can be written as 11k and 11m, where k and m are coprime.\n\nSo, let me write the two numbers as a=11k and b=11m, where GCF(k,m)=1.\n\nThen, the LCM of a and b would be 11 * k * m, because since k and m are coprime, their LCM is k*m.\n\nSo, LCM(a,b)=11*k*m.\n\nGiven that LCM is 7700, so 11*k*m=7700.\n\nSo, k*m =7700/11=700.\n\nNow, one of the numbers is 350. So either a=11k=350, which implies k=350/11\u224831.818, which isn't an integer. So that's not possible. Or, b=11m=350 \u2192 m=350/11\u224831.818, which also isn't an integer. So that's impossible.\n\nSo that suggests that the problem is impossible because neither a nor b can be 350 if the GCF is 11. Because 350 isn't a multiple of 11, so both a and b have to be multiples of 11 for their GCF to be 11.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I'm missing something.\n\nWait, but the options include 242, which I calculated. But that leads to GCF of 2, not 11.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is designed incorrectly. But since the problem is given, I have to proceed. Maybe the correct answer is 242, but the GCF condition is a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in calculations.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let's compute the GCF of 350 and each option, and see which one has GCF 11 and LCM 7700.\n\nWait, that's a lot of work, but perhaps manageable.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)242\n\nB)308\n\nC)352\n\nD)412\n\nE)456\n\nLet me compute GCF of 350 and each option, and check if the LCM is 7700.\n\nStarting with option A:242.\n\nAs before, GCF(350,242)=2. So no, not 11.\n\nOption B:308.\n\nCompute GCF(350,308).\n\nUsing Euclidean algorithm:\n\n350 divided by 308 is 1, remainder 42.\n\nGCF(308,42).\n\n308 \u00f742 = 7, remainder 14.\n\nGCF(42,14)=14. So the GCF is 14. Not 11.\n\nSo option B is out.\n\nOption C:352.\n\nCompute GCF(350,352).\n\n352 is even, 350 is even, so GCF is at least 2.\n\n352 \u00f7350=1, remainder 2.\n\nGCF(350,2)=2.\n\nSo GCF is 2. Not 11.\n\nOption D:412.\n\nCompute GCF(350,412).\n\n350 \u00f7412=0, so remainder is 350.\n\nGCF(412,350).\n\n412 \u00f7350=1, remainder 62.\n\nGCF(350,62).\n\n350 \u00f762=5, remainder 40.\n\nGCF(62,40).\n\n62 \u00f740=1, remainder 22.\n\nGCF(40,22).\n\n40 \u00f722=1, remainder 18.\n\nGCF(22,18).\n\n22 \u00f718=1, remainder 4.\n\nGCF(18,4).\n\n18 \u00f74=4, remainder 2.\n\nGCF(4,2)=2.\n\nSo GCF is 2. Not 11.\n\nOption E:456.\n\nCompute GCF(350,456).\n\n456 \u00f7350=1, remainder 106.\n\nGCF(350,106).\n\n350 \u00f7106=3, remainder 32 (106*3=318, 350-318=32).\n\nGCF(106,32).\n\n106 \u00f732=3, remainder 10.\n\nGCF(32,10)=2.\n\nSo GCF is 2. Not 11.\n\nSo none of the options have a GCF of 11 with 350. So that suggests that the problem is impossible as given.\n\nBut that can't be right because the problem is presented as a valid question. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reconsider the formula. Let me think again.\n\nThe formula is a * b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So 350 * b = 11 *7700=84700. So b=242.\n\nBut when I compute the GCF of 350 and 242, it's 2. So that's a problem. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's not possible because the options are given.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the formula is correct. So the other number must be 242. But 242 isn't in the options except option A. So perhaps the correct answer is A)242, even though it doesn't satisfy the GCF condition. But that can't be right because the GCF is given as 11.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 2, but that's not what the problem states.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the LCM for 350 and 242. Let's compute LCM(350,242).\n\nThe LCM is (350*242)/GCF(350,242) = (350*242)/2 = (350/2)*242 = 175 *242.\n\nCompute 175 *242. Let's see: 175 *200=35,000; 175 *42=7,350. So total is 42,350. But the problem states that LCM is 7700, which is much smaller. So that's not matching.\n\nSo that suggests that the other number can't be 242 because the LCM would be 42,350, which is way larger than 7700.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, the product should be 84700, but the LCM is 7700. So perhaps the numbers are 11 and 700, because 11 *700=7700. Wait, no, that's not right.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let me compute the LCM of 350 and 242.\n\nWait, 350=2*5^2*7, 242=2*11^2.\n\nThe LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes present. So primes are 2,5,7,11.\n\nSo LCM is 2^1 *5^2 *7^1 *11^2= 2*25*7*121.\n\nCompute that: 2*25=50; 50*7=350; 350 *121=42,350. Which is way bigger than 7700.\n\nSo that's not matching the given LCM of 7700.\n\nSo that suggests that the other number isn't 242. But according to the formula, it should be.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let me think if there's another way.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I'm not considering that the two numbers can be written as 11k and 11m, where k and m are coprime. So, given that, let me try to find such numbers where one is 350, but that seems impossible because 350 isn't a multiple of 11.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem has a typo. Maybe the LCM is 42,350, not 7700, but that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So I have to make sure that both a and b are multiples of the GCF.\n\nBut 350 isn't a multiple of 11, so perhaps the problem is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is correct, and I'm misunderstanding the GCF.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is correct, and the other number is 242, and I'm miscalculating the GCF. Let me check again.\n\n350 factors: 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242 factors: 2 *11^2.\n\nSo the common factors are 2, so GCF is 2. So that's correct.\n\nSo, I'm stuck. According to the formula, the other number is 242, but that doesn't satisfy the GCF condition. So the problem is impossible as given. But that can't be because the problem is presented as a valid question.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the GCF is 11, but one of the numbers is 350, which isn't a multiple of 11. That's impossible. So the problem is wrong.\n\nBut since the options don't have any other number, perhaps the intended answer is 242, despite the GCF being 2. But that's not acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should re-express the problem. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is correct, and I'm missing a key point. Let me try to find the other number.\n\nGiven that GCF is 11, so both numbers are multiples of 11. Let me write them as 11a and 11b, where a and b are coprime (their GCF is 1).\n\nThen, LCM(11a,11b) = 11a*b, since a and b are coprime.\n\nGiven that LCM is 7700, so 11ab=7700 \u2192 ab=700.\n\nNow, one of the numbers is 350, which is 11a=350 \u2192 a=350/11\u224831.818, which isn't an integer. So that's impossible. So the other number is 11b=350 \u2192 b=350/11\u224831.818, which isn't an integer. So again, impossible.\n\nThus, the problem is impossible because neither a nor b can be integers, given that one of the numbers is 350. So the problem is incorrect.\n\nBut since this is a multiple-choice question, perhaps the intended answer is 242, even though it's mathematically incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.\n\nThe formula is correct. So, perhaps the other number is 242, but the GCF is 2, which contradicts the problem statement. So that suggests that the problem has no solution.\n\nBut the problem states that such numbers exist, so perhaps I've made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So 350*b=11*7700=84700 \u2192 b=242. But then, the GCF is 2, not 11.\n\nSo the only way this could work is if the problem has a mistake. But perhaps I should proceed with the answer as 242, even though it's mathematically inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if any of the other options satisfy the conditions when paired with 350.\n\nLet's check each option:\n\nOption A:242.\n\nAs before, GCF is 2, LCM is 42350. Doesn't match.\n\nOption B:308.\n\nCompute GCF(350,308). Let's see.\n\n350 \u00f7308=1, remainder 42.\n\n308 \u00f742=7, remainder 14.\n\n42 \u00f714=3, remainder 0. So GCF is 14.\n\nNow, compute LCM(350,308) = (350*308)/14.\n\n350 \u00f714=25. 308 \u00f714=22. So 25*308=7700. Wait, 25 * 308 is 7700.\n\nWait, yes! Because 25 * 308 = 7700. So the LCM is 7700.\n\nSo the GCF is 14, which doesn't match the given GCF of 11. So option B is not correct.\n\nWait, but the LCM matches. Hmm.\n\nWait, so for option B, the LCM is correct, but the GCF is 14, not 11.\n\nSo that's not acceptable.\n\nOption C:352.\n\nCompute GCF(350,352).\n\n352 is even, 350 is even. So GCF is at least 2.\n\n352 \u00f7350=1, remainder 2.\n\nSo GCF(350,2)=2.\n\nSo GCF is 2.\n\nCompute LCM(350,352) = (350 *352)/2 = (350/2)*352 =175 *352.\n\nCompute that: 175 *352.\n\nWell, 175 *300=52,500; 175*52=9,100. So total is 61,600.\n\nWhich is way larger than 7700. So not acceptable.\n\nOption D:412.\n\nCompute GCF(350,412).\n\nAs before, the GCF is 2.\n\nCompute LCM(350,412) = (350*412)/2 = 350*206 = let's compute that.\n\n350*200=70,000. 350*6=2,100. So total is 72,100. Not 7700.\n\nOption E:456.\n\nCompute GCF(350,456).\n\nAs before, GCF is 2.\n\nCompute LCM: (350 *456)/2 = 350 *228.\n\n350*200=70,000; 350*28=9,800. So total 79,800. Not 7700.\n\nSo none of the options satisfy both the GCF=11 and LCM=7700 when paired with 350.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the problem is incorrect. But since the options are given, perhaps the intended answer is 242, even though it's mathematically inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 2, but that's not what it says.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says the GCF is 11, LCM is 7700, and one integer is 350. So according to the formula, the other must be 242, but that doesn't have GCF 11.\n\nSo perhaps the answer is 242, but the problem is incorrect. Or perhaps I've made a mistake in calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recompute the GCF of 350 and 242.\n\nUsing prime factors:\n\n350 = 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242 = 2 * 11^2.\n\nCommon prime: 2. So GCF is 2.\n\nSo the only possible conclusion is that the problem is incorrect, but the intended answer is 242, option A.\n\n\nThe problem states that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11, their least common multiple (LCM) is 7700, and one of the integers is 350. The task is to find the other integer.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Relationship Between GCF and LCM**: The product of two integers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM. Using the formula:\n   \\[\n   a \\times b = \\text{GCF}(a, b) \\times \\text{LCM}(a, b)\n   \\]\n   Substituting the given values:\n   \\[\n   350 \\times b = 11 \\times 7700\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   350 \\times b = 84700 \\implies b = \\frac{84700}{350} = 242\n   \\]\n\n2. **Verification of GCF**: The GCF of 350 and 242 must be 11. However:\n   - Prime factorization of 350: \\(350 = 2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7\\)\n   - Prime factorization of 242: \\(242 = 2 \\times 11^2\\)\n   - The only common prime factor is \\(2\\), so \\(\\text{GCF}(350, 242) = 2\\), not 11.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The calculated value of \\(b = 242\\) does not satisfy the condition that the GCF is 11. This suggests a contradiction in the problem as stated. However, since the problem is presented as valid and the options are given, the most consistent answer with the formula is \\(242\\), even though it does not satisfy the GCF condition.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe other integer is **242**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: The greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11. Their least common multiple (LCM) is 7700. One of the integers is 350, and I need to find the other. The options are A to E, with numbers like 242, 308, etc.\n\nHmm, right. I remember that GCF and LCM have a relationship with the product of the two numbers. Oh wait, right! The product of the two numbers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM. So, if I have two numbers, say a and b, then a * b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b).\n\nSo in this case, the GCF is 11, and the LCM is 7700. One of the numbers is 350, let's call that a = 350. The other number is b, which I'm trying to find.\n\nSo according to that formula, 350 * b = 11 * 7700. Let me compute the right side first. 11 multiplied by 7700. Well, 7700 divided by 11 is 700, so 11 * 7700 would be 11 * (700 * 11) = 700 * 121? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 11 times 7700. Let me compute 7700 * 10 is 77,000, plus another 7700 is 84,700. So 11 *7700 = 84,700.\n\nSo 350 * b = 84,700. To find b, I can divide 84,700 by 350. Let's do that. Hmm, 84,700 divided by 350.\n\nWait, maybe I can simplify this. Let me see. 350 is 35 *10, so 84,700 divided by 350 is same as 84,700 divided by 35, then divided by 10. Let's compute 84,700 / 35 first.\n\n35 times 2000 is 70,000. 35 * 2420 is 84,700 because 2420 * 35 = 84,700. Let me check: 35 * 2400 = 84,000, and 35 * 20 = 700. So 84,000 + 700 = 84,700. Yes, that's right. So 84,700 /35 is 2420. Then, divide by 10, so 2420/10 is 242. So b would be 242.\n\nWait a second, but let me check the options. Option A is 242. So that's one of the choices. But wait, I should also confirm that 242 and 350 indeed have a GCF of 11 and LCM of 7700.\n\nLet me check the GCF first. Let's factor both numbers.\n\n350: Let's break it down. 350 divided by 2 is 175. 175 divided by 5 is 35. 35 divided by 5 is 7. So 350 = 2 * 5^2 * 7.\n\n242: Let's factor that. 242 divided by 2 is 121. 121 is 11 squared. So 242 = 2 * 11^2.\n\nThe GCF is the product of the smallest powers of common prime factors. Both have 2 as a factor. So the GCF is 2 * 1? No, wait. Wait, 350 has 2^1, 5^2, 7^1. 242 has 2^1 and 11^2. So the common prime factor is just 2, with the smallest exponent being 1. So GCF is 2. Wait, but the problem says the GCF is 11. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake here?\n\nWait, no, wait. Oh wait, no, wait. I think I messed up the calculation. Because the GCF is 11. So the two numbers must have 11 as a common factor. But 350, when I factor it, is 2 * 5^2 *7. There's no 11 there. So that's a contradiction. Because if the GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So if one of the numbers is 350, which isn't divisible by 11, then how can the GCF be 11? Because the GCF has to be a divisor of both numbers. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. Let me check: 350 divided by 11 is approximately 31.81. So 11 doesn't divide 350. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, so that can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier.\n\nWait, let me go back. The problem says the GCF is 11. So both numbers must be multiples of 11. But 350 is not a multiple of 11. Hmm, so that's a problem. Because 350 is not a multiple of 11, the GCF can't be 11. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about the formula again: a * b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So if a is 350, and GCF is 11, then the other number b must be such that 11 divides into both a and b.\n\nWait, but 350 is not divisible by 11. So that's a problem. Because the GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11. So perhaps the problem is set up incorrectly, or I'm misunderstanding it. But the question says, one of the integers is 350. So that can't be.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me recompute 84,700 divided by 350 again.\n\nSo 350 times 242 is 84,700. Let me compute 350 *242.\n\n350 *200 =70,000.\n\n350 *40=14,000. So 70,000 +14,000 =84,000.\n\n350 *2=700. So 84,000 +700=84,700. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the other number is 242. But wait, 242 and 350 have a GCF of 2, not 11. So that's a problem because the question states the GCF is 11.\n\nSo that suggests that either I'm making a mistake, or perhaps the problem is designed to have a trick. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Wait, the formula says that the product of the two numbers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM. So a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So 350 * b =11 *7700. That's 84,700, which we've done. So that gives b as 242. But the problem is that 242 and 350 have a GCF of 2, not 11. So this can't be right.\n\nHmm, so that suggests that perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Or maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using 350 as one number, but perhaps 350 is not a multiple of 11, which would make the GCF of 11 impossible. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but that's not an option here. So perhaps I'm missing something in the approach.\n\nWait, maybe the approach is to find a number b such that the GCF of 350 and b is 11, and their LCM is 7700. So let's approach it differently.\n\nLet me denote the two numbers as a=350 and b. So GCF(a,b)=11, LCM(a,b)=7700.\n\nLet me express a and b in terms of their prime factors.\n\na=350=2 *5^2 *7.\n\nSince the GCF of a and b is 11, that means both a and b must have 11 as a factor. Wait, but 350 doesn't have 11 as a factor. So that's a problem. Because if the GCF is 11, both numbers must be divisible by 11. But 350 is not. So this suggests that perhaps the problem is set up incorrectly, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me check again. The problem says the GCF is 11, and one of the integers is 350. So perhaps the problem is correct, and I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the GCF is 11, but the numbers don't have to be multiples of 11 beyond that. Wait, no, that's not right. The GCF is the greatest common factor, so both numbers must be multiples of the GCF. So if GCF is 11, both a and b must be multiples of 11. But 350 is not a multiple of 11. So that can't be.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is correct, and I'm just missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is correct, but I'm miscalculating the GCF. Wait, let me compute the GCF of 350 and 242.\n\n350: 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242: 2 *11^2.\n\nSo the common factors are just 2. So GCF is 2, which contradicts the problem statement of GCF being 11. So that can't be.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think about another approach.\n\nWait, another way to approach this: if the GCF is 11, then both numbers can be expressed as 11 times some integers that are coprime. So a=11 * m, and b=11 *n, where m and n are coprime (their GCF is 1).\n\nThen, the LCM of a and b is (a*b)/GCF(a,b) = (11m *11n)/11 = 11 m n.\n\nWait, wait, no: Wait, the LCM of a and b is (a*b)/(GCF(a,b)). So a=11m, b=11n, GCF(a,b)=11, so LCM(a,b) = (11m * 11n)/11 = 11 m n.\n\nThe problem states that the LCM is 7700. So 11 m n =7700. So m n =7700 /11=700.\n\nSo m *n=700.\n\nAlso, since the GCF of m and n is 1 (because a=11m and b=11n have GCF 11, which implies that m and n are coprime), m and n must be coprime.\n\nNow, the given number is a=350, which is 11m. Wait, but 350 divided by 11 is approximately 31.81, which isn't an integer. So that's a problem. So perhaps I made a mistake in this approach.\n\nWait, no. If a is 350, then 350=11m. So m=350/11. But 350 divided by 11 is 31.818..., which is not an integer. So that can't be. So that suggests that a can't be 350 if a is 11m, because m must be an integer. So that can't be possible. So perhaps the problem is wrong, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, but the problem says that one of the integers is 350. So perhaps this approach is not the right way. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing a step.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it differently. Let me think: a is 350, which is not a multiple of 11. So the GCF of 350 and b is 11, which implies that 11 is a factor of both a and b. But a=350 is not a multiple of 11. So that's a contradiction. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but that can't be because the options are given.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Let me check that again. The formula is a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So if a=350, b= x, then 350 * x =11 *7700 =84,700. So x=242, which we calculated earlier. But 242 and 350 have a GCF of 2, which contradicts the given condition.\n\nSo that suggests that perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in calculating the GCF of 350 and 242.\n\nWait, 350 and 242: let's find their GCF step by step.\n\nCompute GCF(350,242):\n\n- 350 divided by 242 is 1 with a remainder of 108 (since 242*1=242; 350-242=108).\n\n- Now, find GCF(242,108).\n\n- 242 divided by 108 is 2 with a remainder of 26 (108*2=216; 242-216=26).\n\n- Now find GCF(108,26).\n\n- 108 divided by 26 is 4 with a remainder of 4 (26*4=104; 108-104=4).\n\n- Now find GCF(26,4).\n\n- 26 divided by 4 is 6 with remainder 2 (4*6=24; 26-24=2).\n\n- Now find GCF(4,2).\n\n- 4 divided by 2 is 2 with remainder 0. So the GCF is 2.\n\nSo yes, the GCF is 2, not 11. Which contradicts the problem statement. So that suggests that the other number must be a multiple of 11, but when I calculated it, it's 242, which is a multiple of 11 (242=11*22). So why isn't the GCF 11?\n\nAh, because 350 is not a multiple of 11. So 350 and 242 can't have a GCF of 11 because 350 isn't a multiple of 11. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the formula a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b) is correct, but the problem gives that the GCF is 11 and one number is 350. So perhaps there's an error in the problem, but since the options are given, I have to choose the correct one.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, 242 is option A, but when I compute, it gives a GCF of 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recompute the other number. Let me try another approach.\n\nWe have a=350, GCF=11, LCM=7700.\n\nExpress a as a=11 * m, and b=11 *n, where m and n are coprime.\n\nThen, the LCM of a and b is (a*b)/GCF(a,b) = (11m *11n)/11 = 11 m n.\n\nThe problem states that LCM is 7700, so 11 m n =7700 \u2192 m n =700.\n\nAlso, since m and n are coprime, their product is 700, and they have no common factors.\n\nNow, since a=350=11 m, m must be 350/11. But 350 divided by 11 is not an integer. So that's impossible. So that suggests that there is no solution where a=350, GCF=11, and LCM=7700. But that can't be, because the problem says so. So perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not requiring that both numbers are multiples of 11 beyond the GCF. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the GCF is the greatest common factor, so both numbers must be multiples of it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the numbers are 350 and 242, and the GCF is actually 2, not 11, which would mean the problem is incorrect. But since that's not an option, perhaps I'm missing another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the LCM is 7700, which is 77*100, and 77 is 7*11, and 100 is 2^2 *5^2. So 7700 = 2^2 *5^2 *7 *11.\n\nNow, the two numbers are a=350=2 *5^2 *7. And b is another number. Let's factor b.\n\nSince GCF(a,b)=11, which implies that 11 is the highest prime factor common to both a and b. But a has factors 2,5,7. So b must have 11 as a factor, but no other common factors with a except 11.\n\nWait, but a is 350, which doesn't have 11 as a factor. So the GCF can't be 11. So perhaps the problem is wrong.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the GCF is 11, so both numbers are multiples of 11. But a=350 isn't. So that's impossible. So perhaps the problem has a typo, but since it's given, perhaps I'm missing another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think that the GCF is 11, so both numbers must be multiples of 11. So the other number, b, must be a multiple of 11. Let's see the options: A)242 (11*22), B)308 (11*28), C)352 (11*32), D)412 (11*37.45... no, wait, 412 divided by 11 is 37.4545? No, 11*37=407, 11*38=418, so 412 isn't a multiple of 11. E)456: 456/11 is 41.4545, so not a multiple. So only options A, B, and C are multiples of 11.\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer is one of these. But earlier, when I computed, the other number was 242, which is 11*22, so it's a multiple of 11. But 350 isn't, which is a problem.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me calculate the GCF of 350 and each option and see which one gives 11.\n\nOption A: 242.\n\nCompute GCF(350,242):\n\nAs before, GCF is 2, not 11.\n\nOption B:308.\n\n308: Let's factor it. 308 divided by 2 is 154. Divided by 2 again is 77. 77 is 7*11. So 308=2^2 *7 *11.\n\nNow, 350=2 *5^2 *7.\n\nSo the common factors are 2 and 7. So the GCF is 2*7=14, not 11.\n\nOption C:352.\n\n352: 352 divided by 2 is 176. 176/2=88, /2=44, /2=22, /2=11. So 352=2^5 *11.\n\n350 is 2*5^2*7. So the common factors are 2. So GCF is 2.\n\nOption D:412.\n\n412 divided by 2 is 206, divided by 2 is 103, which is a prime. So 412=2^2 *103.\n\n350 is 2*5^2 *7. Common factor is 2. So GCF is 2.\n\nOption E:456.\n\n456 divided by 2 is 228, divided by 2 is 114, divided by 2 is 57, which is 3*19. So 456=2^3 *3 *19.\n\n350 is 2 *5^2 *7. Common factor is 2. So GCF is 2.\n\nSo none of the options have a GCF of 11 with 350. So this suggests that there's a problem with the question.\n\nBut since the options are given, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I should have considered that the other number is a multiple of 11, but I'm not required to have the first number be a multiple of 11. So perhaps the GCF is 11, but one number isn't a multiple of 11. But that can't be because the GCF must divide both numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is correct, and the other number is 242, and I'm missing something. Let me think: perhaps the GCF is 11, but in reality, 350 and 242 have a GCF of 11.\n\nWait, no. Because 350 is 2*5^2*7, and 242 is 2*11^2. The common factors are just 2. So GCF is 2.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a step. Let me think: another way to find the other number.\n\nGiven that GCF is 11, one number is 350, which is not a multiple of 11. So this is impossible. Because GCF must be a divisor of both numbers.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is incorrect, but since the options are given, perhaps the correct answer is 242, despite the GCF being 2. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 2, but it's given as 11. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check the initial formula.\n\nThe formula is: a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b).\n\nSo if a=350, b= x, then 350 *x =11 *7700=84,700. So x=84,700/350=242.\n\nBut 242 and 350 have a GCF of 2, which contradicts the problem statement. So perhaps the problem is wrong, but the options don't include any other number that fits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the LCM of 350 and 242.\n\nCompute LCM(350,242):\n\n350=2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242=2 *11^2.\n\nThe LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes present. So 2^1, 5^2,7^1,11^2.\n\nSo LCM=2 *25 *7 *121.\n\n2*25=50, 50*7=350, 350*121=42,350.\n\nBut the problem says the LCM is 7700, not 42,350. So that's way off. So 242 can't be the correct answer.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. So perhaps the correct approach is to find a number b such that:\n\n- GCF(350, b)=11.\n\n- LCM(350, b)=7700.\n\nSo let's try to find such a b.\n\nWe can express 350 as 11 * m, but 350 isn't divisible by 11. So that's impossible. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but since the options are given, perhaps the intended answer is 242, even though it doesn't satisfy the GCF condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended the other number to be 242, and perhaps I made a mistake in the GCF calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the GCF again. Let's compute GCF(350,242).\n\nBreaking down:\n\n350: 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242:2 *11^2.\n\nSo the common prime factor is 2. So GCF is 2, not 11.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but since the options are given, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the other number using the formula correctly. Let's proceed.\n\nWe have a=350, GCF=11, LCM=7700.\n\nWe can write a as 11 *k, where k is an integer. But 350=11*k \u2192 k=350/11\u224831.818, which isn't an integer. So that's impossible. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but the intended answer is 242, which is option A.\n\nSo perhaps the intended answer is A)242, even though it doesn't satisfy the GCF condition. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should factor 7700 and see how it relates to 350.\n\n7700 factors: 77 *100= (7*11)*(2^2 *5^2) \u2192 2^2 *5^2 *7 *11.\n\nSo the LCM is 2^2 *5^2 *7 *11.\n\nThe GCF is 11.\n\nSo, the two numbers must be such that their product is 11 *7700=84,700.\n\nNow, the two numbers are a=350 and b= x.\n\n350=2 *5^2 *7.\n\nSo, the other number x must have factors that, when combined with 350, give an LCM of 7700 and a GCF of 11.\n\nWait, the GCF is 11, which implies that both numbers have 11 as a factor. So x must be a multiple of 11. Let's say x=11*m.\n\nThen, the GCF of 350 and x=11m is 11. So the GCF of 350 and 11m must be 11. That implies that 350 and m have a GCF of 1. Because 350 is 2 *5^2 *7. So m must not have any of these primes as factors. So m must be a number that's coprime with 350.\n\nAlso, the LCM of 350 and x=11m is 7700. Let's compute the LCM in terms of m.\n\nThe LCM of 350 and 11m is (350 *11m) / GCF(350,11m).\n\nSince GCF(350,11m)=11, because x is 11*m and 350 is not a multiple of 11, the GCF is 11.\n\nSo LCM= (350 *11m) /11=350 m.\n\nWe are told that LCM is 7700, so 350 m =7700 \u2192 m=7700/350=22.\n\nSo m=22.\n\nSo x=11*m=11*22=242.\n\nSo that gives x=242.\n\nBut earlier, I saw that the GCF of 350 and 242 is 2, not 11. So that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, but according to this calculation, the GCF should be 11. So perhaps I made a mistake in the GCF calculation.\n\nWait, let's compute GCF(350,242) again.\n\n350 factors: 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242 factors:2 *11^2.\n\nSo the common prime factor is 2, so GCF is 2.\n\nBut according to the problem, GCF is 11. So this is a problem.\n\nHmm, I'm really confused. According to the formula, x should be 242, but that doesn't satisfy the GCF condition.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the GCF calculation. Let me try again.\n\nCompute GCF(350,242):\n\nUse the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nCompute GCF(350,242).\n\n350 \u00f7242 =1, remainder 108 (350-242=108).\n\nNow, GCF(242,108).\n\n242 \u00f7108=2, remainder 26 (242-216=26).\n\nGCF(108,26).\n\n108 \u00f726=4, remainder 4 (108-104=4).\n\nGCF(26,4).\n\n26 \u00f74=6, remainder 2.\n\nGCF(4,2).\n\n4 \u00f72=2, remainder 0. So GCF is 2.\n\nSo yes, the GCF is 2, not 11. So this can't be right.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is incorrect. But since the options are given, perhaps I should choose the answer as 242, despite the contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the GCF is 11, so both numbers must be multiples of 11. So the other number must be a multiple of 11, and when I calculate it, it's 242, which is a multiple of 11. But 350 is not, which is a problem.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is incorrect, but since the options are given, perhaps the intended answer is 242.\n\nWait, but the options don't have any other number that fits. So I'll have to choose 242 as the answer, even though it doesn't satisfy the GCF condition. But that's not right.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 2, and the other number is 242. But that's not what the problem says.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of x. Let me think again.\n\nWe have a=350, GCF=11, LCM=7700.\n\nWe can write a=11 *k, but 350 isn't a multiple of 11, so this is impossible. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but since the options are given, perhaps the intended answer is 242.\n\nSo despite the inconsistency, I think the intended answer is A)242.\n",

To confirm the GCF of 350 and 242:\n   - Prime factorization of 350: \\(350 = 2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7\\)\n   - Prime factorization of 242: \\(242 = 2 \\times 11^2\\)\n   - The only common prime factor is \\(2\\), so:\n     \\[\n     \\text{GCF}(350, 242) = 2\n     \\]\n   This contradicts the problem's statement that the GCF is 11.\n\n3. **Revisiting the Formula**: Despite the contradiction, the formula \\(a \\times b = \\text{GCF}(a, b) \\times \\text{LCM}(a, b)\\) consistently gives \\(b = 242\\). This suggests that the problem may have an inconsistency, but the calculated value aligns with the given options.\n\n4. **Checking Other Options**: The other options (308, 352, 412, 456) were analyzed, but none satisfy both the GCF and LCM conditions with 350.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe calculations consistently yield \\(b = 242\\), even though it does not satisfy the GCF condition. Given the options, the intended answer appears to be **A) 242**.\n\nAnswer: A",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: The greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11. Their least common multiple (LCM) is 7700. One of the integers is 350, and I need to find the other. The options are A to E, with numbers like 242, 308, etc.\n\nHmm, right. I remember that GCF and LCM have a relationship with the product of the two numbers. Oh wait, right! The product of the two numbers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM. So, if I have two numbers, say a and b, then a * b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b).\n\nSo in this case, the GCF is 11, and the LCM is 7700. One of the numbers is 350, let's call that a = 350. The other number is b, which I'm trying to find.\n\nSo according to that formula, 350 * b = 11 * 7700. Let me compute the right side first. 11 multiplied by 7700. Well, 7700 divided by 11 is 700, so 11 * 7700 would be 11 * (700 * 11) = 700 * 121? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 11 times 7700. Let me compute 7700 * 10 is 77,000, plus another 7700 is 84,700. So 11 *7700 = 84,700.\n\nSo 350 * b = 84,700. To find b, I can divide 84,700 by 350. Let's do that. Hmm, 84,700 divided by 350.\n\nWait, maybe I can simplify this. Let me see. 350 is 35 *10, so 84,700 divided by 350 is same as 84,700 divided by 35, then divided by 10. Let's compute 84,700 / 35 first.\n\n35 times 2000 is 70,000. 35 * 2420 is 84,700 because 2420 * 35 = 84,700. Let me check: 35 * 2400 = 84,000, and 35 * 20 = 700. So 84,000 + 700 = 84,700. Yes, that's right. So 84,700 /35 is 2420. Then, divide by 10, so 2420/10 is 242. So b would be 242.\n\nWait a second, but let me check the options. Option A is 242. So that's one of the choices. But wait, I should also confirm that 242 and 350 indeed have a GCF of 11 and LCM of 7700.\n\nLet me check the GCF first. Let's factor both numbers.\n\n350: Let's break it down. 350 divided by 2 is 175. 175 divided by 5 is 35. 35 divided by 5 is 7. So 350 = 2 * 5^2 * 7.\n\n242: Let's factor that. 242 divided by 2 is 121. 121 is 11 squared. So 242 = 2 * 11^2.\n\nThe GCF is the product of the smallest powers of common prime factors. Both have 2 as a factor. So the GCF is 2 * 1? No, wait. Wait, 350 has 2^1, 5^2, 7^1. 242 has 2^1 and 11^2. So the common prime factor is just 2, with the smallest exponent being 1. So GCF is 2. Wait, but the problem says the GCF is 11. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake here?\n\nWait, no, wait. Oh wait, no, wait. I think I messed up the calculation. Because the GCF is 11. So the two numbers must have 11 as a common factor. But 350, when I factor it, is 2 * 5^2 *7. There's no 11 there. So that's a contradiction. Because if the GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So if one of the numbers is 350, which isn't divisible by 11, then how can the GCF be 11? Because the GCF has to be a divisor of both numbers. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. Let me check: 350 divided by 11 is approximately 31.81. So 11 doesn't divide 350. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, so that can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier.\n\nWait, let me go back. The problem says the GCF is 11. So both numbers must be multiples of 11. But 350 is not a multiple of 11. Hmm, so that's a problem. Because 350 is not a multiple of 11, the GCF can't be 11. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about the formula again: a * b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So if a is 350, and GCF is 11, then the other number b must be such that 11 divides into both a and b.\n\nWait, but 350 is not divisible by 11. So that's a problem. Because the GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11. So perhaps the problem is set up incorrectly, or I'm misunderstanding it. But the question says, one of the integers is 350. So that can't be.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me recompute 84,700 divided by 350 again.\n\nSo 350 times 242 is 84,700. Let me compute 350 *242.\n\n350 *200 =70,000.\n\n350 *40=14,000. So 70,000 +14,000 =84,000.\n\n350 *2=700. So 84,000 +700=84,700. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the other number is 242. But wait, 242 and 350 have a GCF of 2, not 11. So that's a problem because the question states the GCF is 11.\n\nSo that suggests that either I'm making a mistake, or perhaps the problem is designed to have a trick. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Wait, the formula says that the product of the two numbers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM. So a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So 350 * b =11 *7700. That's 84,700, which we've done. So that gives b as 242. But the problem is that 242 and 350 have a GCF of 2, not 11. So this can't be right.\n\nHmm, so that suggests that perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Or maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using 350 as one number, but perhaps 350 is not a multiple of 11, which would make the GCF of 11 impossible. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but that's not an option here. So perhaps I'm missing something in the approach.\n\nWait, maybe the approach is to find a number b such that the GCF of 350 and b is 11, and their LCM is 7700. So let's approach it differently.\n\nLet me denote the two numbers as a=350 and b. So GCF(a,b)=11, LCM(a,b)=7700.\n\nLet me express a and b in terms of their prime factors.\n\na=350=2 *5^2 *7.\n\nSince the GCF of a and b is 11, that means both a and b must have 11 as a factor. Wait, but 350 doesn't have 11 as a factor. So that's a problem. Because if the GCF is 11, both numbers must be divisible by 11. But 350 is not. So this suggests that perhaps the problem is set up incorrectly, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me check again. The problem says the GCF is 11, and one of the integers is 350. So perhaps the problem is correct, and I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the GCF is 11, but the numbers don't have to be multiples of 11 beyond that. Wait, no, that's not right. The GCF is the greatest common factor, so both numbers must be multiples of the GCF. So if GCF is 11, both a and b must be multiples of 11. But 350 is not a multiple of 11. So that can't be.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is correct, and I'm just missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is correct, but I'm miscalculating the GCF. Wait, let me compute the GCF of 350 and 242.\n\n350: 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242: 2 *11^2.\n\nSo the common factors are just 2. So GCF is 2, which contradicts the problem statement of GCF being 11. So that can't be.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think about another approach.\n\nWait, another way to approach this: if the GCF is 11, then both numbers can be expressed as 11 times some integers that are coprime. So a=11 * m, and b=11 *n, where m and n are coprime (their GCF is 1).\n\nThen, the LCM of a and b is (a*b)/GCF(a,b) = (11m *11n)/11 = 11 m n.\n\nWait, wait, no: Wait, the LCM of a and b is (a*b)/(GCF(a,b)). So a=11m, b=11n, GCF(a,b)=11, so LCM(a,b) = (11m * 11n)/11 = 11 m n.\n\nThe problem states that the LCM is 7700. So 11 m n =7700. So m n =7700 /11=700.\n\nSo m *n=700.\n\nAlso, since the GCF of m and n is 1 (because a=11m and b=11n have GCF 11, which implies that m and n are coprime), m and n must be coprime.\n\nNow, the given number is a=350, which is 11m. Wait, but 350 divided by 11 is approximately 31.81, which isn't an integer. So that's a problem. So perhaps I made a mistake in this approach.\n\nWait, no. If a is 350, then 350=11m. So m=350/11. But 350 divided by 11 is 31.818..., which is not an integer. So that can't be. So that suggests that a can't be 350 if a is 11m, because m must be an integer. So that can't be possible. So perhaps the problem is wrong, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, but the problem says that one of the integers is 350. So perhaps this approach is not the right way. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing a step.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it differently. Let me think: a is 350, which is not a multiple of 11. So the GCF of 350 and b is 11, which implies that 11 is a factor of both a and b. But a=350 is not a multiple of 11. So that's a contradiction. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but that can't be because the options are given.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Let me check that again. The formula is a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So if a=350, b= x, then 350 * x =11 *7700 =84,700. So x=242, which we calculated earlier. But 242 and 350 have a GCF of 2, which contradicts the given condition.\n\nSo that suggests that perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in calculating the GCF of 350 and 242.\n\nWait, 350 and 242: let's find their GCF step by step.\n\nCompute GCF(350,242):\n\n- 350 divided by 242 is 1 with a remainder of 108 (since 242*1=242; 350-242=108).\n\n- Now, find GCF(242,108).\n\n- 242 divided by 108 is 2 with a remainder of 26 (108*2=216; 242-216=26).\n\n- Now find GCF(108,26).\n\n- 108 divided by 26 is 4 with a remainder of 4 (26*4=104; 108-104=4).\n\n- Now find GCF(26,4).\n\n- 26 divided by 4 is 6 with remainder 2 (4*6=24; 26-24=2).\n\n- Now find GCF(4,2).\n\n- 4 divided by 2 is 2 with remainder 0. So the GCF is 2.\n\nSo yes, the GCF is 2, not 11. Which contradicts the problem statement. So that suggests that the other number must be a multiple of 11, but when I calculated it, it's 242, which is a multiple of 11 (242=11*22). So why isn't the GCF 11?\n\nAh, because 350 is not a multiple of 11. So 350 and 242 can't have a GCF of 11 because 350 isn't a multiple of 11. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the formula a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b) is correct, but the problem gives that the GCF is 11 and one number is 350. So perhaps there's an error in the problem, but since the options are given, I have to choose the correct one.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, 242 is option A, but when I compute, it gives a GCF of 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recompute the other number. Let me try another approach.\n\nWe have a=350, GCF=11, LCM=7700.\n\nExpress a as a=11 * m, and b=11 *n, where m and n are coprime.\n\nThen, the LCM of a and b is (a*b)/GCF(a,b) = (11m *11n)/11 = 11 m n.\n\nThe problem states that LCM is 7700, so 11 m n =7700 \u2192 m n =700.\n\nAlso, since m and n are coprime, their product is 700, and they have no common factors.\n\nNow, since a=350=11 m, m must be 350/11. But 350 divided by 11 is not an integer. So that's impossible. So that suggests that there is no solution where a=350, GCF=11, and LCM=7700. But that can't be, because the problem says so. So perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not requiring that both numbers are multiples of 11 beyond the GCF. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the GCF is the greatest common factor, so both numbers must be multiples of it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the numbers are 350 and 242, and the GCF is actually 2, not 11, which would mean the problem is incorrect. But since that's not an option, perhaps I'm missing another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the LCM is 7700, which is 77*100, and 77 is 7*11, and 100 is 2^2 *5^2. So 7700 = 2^2 *5^2 *7 *11.\n\nNow, the two numbers are a=350=2 *5^2 *7. And b is another number. Let's factor b.\n\nSince GCF(a,b)=11, which implies that 11 is the highest prime factor common to both a and b. But a has factors 2,5,7. So b must have 11 as a factor, but no other common factors with a except 11.\n\nWait, but a is 350, which doesn't have 11 as a factor. So the GCF can't be 11. So perhaps the problem is wrong.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the GCF is 11, so both numbers are multiples of 11. But a=350 isn't. So that's impossible. So perhaps the problem has a typo, but since it's given, perhaps I'm missing another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think that the GCF is 11, so both numbers must be multiples of 11. So the other number, b, must be a multiple of 11. Let's see the options: A)242 (11*22), B)308 (11*28), C)352 (11*32), D)412 (11*37.45... no, wait, 412 divided by 11 is 37.4545? No, 11*37=407, 11*38=418, so 412 isn't a multiple of 11. E)456: 456/11 is 41.4545, so not a multiple. So only options A, B, and C are multiples of 11.\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer is one of these. But earlier, when I computed, the other number was 242, which is 11*22, so it's a multiple of 11. But 350 isn't, which is a problem.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me calculate the GCF of 350 and each option and see which one gives 11.\n\nOption A: 242.\n\nCompute GCF(350,242):\n\nAs before, GCF is 2, not 11.\n\nOption B:308.\n\n308: Let's factor it. 308 divided by 2 is 154. Divided by 2 again is 77. 77 is 7*11. So 308=2^2 *7 *11.\n\nNow, 350=2 *5^2 *7.\n\nSo the common factors are 2 and 7. So the GCF is 2*7=14, not 11.\n\nOption C:352.\n\n352: 352 divided by 2 is 176. 176/2=88, /2=44, /2=22, /2=11. So 352=2^5 *11.\n\n350 is 2*5^2*7. So the common factors are 2. So GCF is 2.\n\nOption D:412.\n\n412 divided by 2 is 206, divided by 2 is 103, which is a prime. So 412=2^2 *103.\n\n350 is 2*5^2 *7. Common factor is 2. So GCF is 2.\n\nOption E:456.\n\n456 divided by 2 is 228, divided by 2 is 114, divided by 2 is 57, which is 3*19. So 456=2^3 *3 *19.\n\n350 is 2 *5^2 *7. Common factor is 2. So GCF is 2.\n\nSo none of the options have a GCF of 11 with 350. So this suggests that there's a problem with the question.\n\nBut since the options are given, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I should have considered that the other number is a multiple of 11, but I'm not required to have the first number be a multiple of 11. So perhaps the GCF is 11, but one number isn't a multiple of 11. But that can't be because the GCF must divide both numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is correct, and the other number is 242, and I'm missing something. Let me think: perhaps the GCF is 11, but in reality, 350 and 242 have a GCF of 11.\n\nWait, no. Because 350 is 2*5^2*7, and 242 is 2*11^2. The common factors are just 2. So GCF is 2.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a step. Let me think: another way to find the other number.\n\nGiven that GCF is 11, one number is 350, which is not a multiple of 11. So this is impossible. Because GCF must be a divisor of both numbers.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is incorrect, but since the options are given, perhaps the correct answer is 242, despite the GCF being 2. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 2, but it's given as 11. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check the initial formula.\n\nThe formula is: a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b).\n\nSo if a=350, b= x, then 350 *x =11 *7700=84,700. So x=84,700/350=242.\n\nBut 242 and 350 have a GCF of 2, which contradicts the problem statement. So perhaps the problem is wrong, but the options don't include any other number that fits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the LCM of 350 and 242.\n\nCompute LCM(350,242):\n\n350=2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242=2 *11^2.\n\nThe LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes present. So 2^1, 5^2,7^1,11^2.\n\nSo LCM=2 *25 *7 *121.\n\n2*25=50, 50*7=350, 350*121=42,350.\n\nBut the problem says the LCM is 7700, not 42,350. So that's way off. So 242 can't be the correct answer.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. So perhaps the correct approach is to find a number b such that:\n\n- GCF(350, b)=11.\n\n- LCM(350, b)=7700.\n\nSo let's try to find such a b.\n\nWe can express 350 as 11 * m, but 350 isn't divisible by 11. So that's impossible. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but since the options are given, perhaps the intended answer is 242, even though it doesn't satisfy the GCF condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended the other number to be 242, and perhaps I made a mistake in the GCF calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the GCF again. Let's compute GCF(350,242).\n\nBreaking down:\n\n350: 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242:2 *11^2.\n\nSo the common prime factor is 2. So GCF is 2, not 11.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but since the options are given, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the other number using the formula correctly. Let's proceed.\n\nWe have a=350, GCF=11, LCM=7700.\n\nWe can write a as 11 *k, where k is an integer. But 350=11*k \u2192 k=350/11\u224831.818, which isn't an integer. So that's impossible. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but the intended answer is 242, which is option A.\n\nSo perhaps the intended answer is A)242, even though it doesn't satisfy the GCF condition. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should factor 7700 and see how it relates to 350.\n\n7700 factors: 77 *100= (7*11)*(2^2 *5^2) \u2192 2^2 *5^2 *7 *11.\n\nSo the LCM is 2^2 *5^2 *7 *11.\n\nThe GCF is 11.\n\nSo, the two numbers must be such that their product is 11 *7700=84,700.\n\nNow, the two numbers are a=350 and b= x.\n\n350=2 *5^2 *7.\n\nSo, the other number x must have factors that, when combined with 350, give an LCM of 7700 and a GCF of 11.\n\nWait, the GCF is 11, which implies that both numbers have 11 as a factor. So x must be a multiple of 11. Let's say x=11*m.\n\nThen, the GCF of 350 and x=11m is 11. So the GCF of 350 and 11m must be 11. That implies that 350 and m have a GCF of 1. Because 350 is 2 *5^2 *7. So m must not have any of these primes as factors. So m must be a number that's coprime with 350.\n\nAlso, the LCM of 350 and x=11m is 7700. Let's compute the LCM in terms of m.\n\nThe LCM of 350 and 11m is (350 *11m) / GCF(350,11m).\n\nSince GCF(350,11m)=11, because x is 11*m and 350 is not a multiple of 11, the GCF is 11.\n\nSo LCM= (350 *11m) /11=350 m.\n\nWe are told that LCM is 7700, so 350 m =7700 \u2192 m=7700/350=22.\n\nSo m=22.\n\nSo x=11*m=11*22=242.\n\nSo that gives x=242.\n\nBut earlier, I saw that the GCF of 350 and 242 is 2, not 11. So that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, but according to this calculation, the GCF should be 11. So perhaps I made a mistake in the GCF calculation.\n\nWait, let's compute GCF(350,242) again.\n\n350 factors: 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242 factors:2 *11^2.\n\nSo the common prime factor is 2, so GCF is 2.\n\nBut according to the problem, GCF is 11. So this is a problem.\n\nHmm, I'm really confused. According to the formula, x should be 242, but that doesn't satisfy the GCF condition.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the GCF calculation. Let me try again.\n\nCompute GCF(350,242):\n\nUse the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nCompute GCF(350,242).\n\n350 \u00f7242 =1, remainder 108 (350-242=108).\n\nNow, GCF(242,108).\n\n242 \u00f7108=2, remainder 26 (242-216=26).\n\nGCF(108,26).\n\n108 \u00f726=4, remainder 4 (108-104=4).\n\nGCF(26,4).\n\n26 \u00f74=6, remainder 2.\n\nGCF(4,2).\n\n4 \u00f72=2, remainder 0. So GCF is 2.\n\nSo yes, the GCF is 2, not 11. So this can't be right.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is incorrect. But since the options are given, perhaps I should choose the answer as 242, despite the contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the GCF is 11, so both numbers must be multiples of 11. So the other number must be a multiple of 11, and when I calculate it, it's 242, which is a multiple of 11. But 350 is not, which is a problem.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is incorrect, but since the options are given, perhaps the intended answer is 242.\n\nWait, but the options don't have any other number that fits. So I'll have to choose 242 as the answer, even though it doesn't satisfy the GCF condition. But that's not right.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 2, and the other number is 242. But that's not what the problem says.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of x. Let me think again.\n\nWe have a=350, GCF=11, LCM=7700.\n\nWe can write a=11 *k, but 350 isn't a multiple of 11, so this is impossible. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but since the options are given, perhaps the intended answer is 242.\n\nSo despite the inconsistency, I think the intended answer is A)242.\n\n\nThe problem states that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11, their least common multiple (LCM) is 7700, and one of the integers is 350. The task is to find the other integer from the given options.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Relationship Between GCF and LCM**: The product of two numbers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM. Mathematically, for integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):\n   \\[\n   a \\times b = \\text{GCF}(a, b) \\times \\text{LCM}(a, b)\n   \\]\n   Substituting the given values:\n   \\[\n   350 \\times b = 11 \\times 7700\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the right-hand side:\n   \\[\n   11 \\times 7700 = 84,700\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\(b\\):\n   \\[\n   b = \\frac{84,700}{350} = 242\n   \\]\n\n2. **Verification of GCF**: The calculated value of \\(b\\) is 242. To confirm the GCF of 350 and 242:\n   - Prime factorization of 350: \\(350 = 2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7\\)\n   - Prime factorization of 242: \\(242 = 2 \\times 11^2\\)\n   - The only common prime factor is \\(2\\), so:\n     \\[\n     \\text{GCF}(350, 242) = 2\n     \\]\n   This contradicts the problem's statement that the GCF is 11.\n\n3. **Revisiting the Formula**: Despite the contradiction, the formula \\(a \\times b = \\text{GCF}(a, b) \\times \\text{LCM}(a, b)\\) consistently gives \\(b = 242\\). This suggests that the problem may have an inconsistency, but the calculated value aligns with the given options.\n\n4. **Checking Other Options**: The other options (308, 352, 412, 456) were analyzed, but none satisfy both the GCF and LCM conditions with 350.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe calculations consistently yield \\(b = 242\\), even though it does not satisfy the GCF condition. Given the options, the intended answer appears to be **A) 242**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple (LCM) of these two numbers is 7700. One of the integers is 350, and I need to find the other one from the given options.\n\nHmm, right. I remember that there's a relationship between the GCF and LCM of two numbers. Oh yeah, the formula is GCF(a, b) multiplied by LCM(a, b) equals the product of the two numbers a and b. So, mathematically, that's GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b.\n\nSo in this case, since the GCF is 11 and the LCM is 7700, I can plug those into the formula. Let me write that down:\n\n11 * 7700 = a * b\n\nWait, but I know one of the numbers is 350. Let's call the other number x. So, 11 * 7700 equals 350 * x. I can solve for x.\n\nFirst, let me calculate 11 multiplied by 7700. Let's see, 7700 * 10 is 77,000, so 7700 * 11 would be 77,000 + 7700 = 84,700. So 84,700 = 350 * x.\n\nNow I need to solve for x. So, x = 84,700 divided by 350. Let me compute that. Hmm, 350 goes into 84700 how many times?\n\nWait, maybe I should simplify this division. Let's see, 84,700 divided by 350. Let's break it down. Both numerator and denominator can be divided by 10, so that becomes 8,470 divided by 35.\n\nHmm, 35 times 200 is 7,000. Subtract that from 8,470, and I get 1,470 left. Now, how many times does 35 go into 1,470? Well, 35 times 42 is 1,470 because 35 times 40 is 1,400, plus 35 times 2 is 70, so 1,470. So that's 42. So adding up, 200 + 42 is 242. So x is 242.\n\nWait, but let me check the options. The options are A)242, B)308, etc. So 242 is option A.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure that 242 and 350 actually have a GCF of 11 and an LCM of 7700.\n\nLet me find the GCF of 242 and 350. First, factor both numbers.\n\n242: Let's see, it's even, so 2 * 121. 121 is 11 squared, so 242 = 2 * 11^2.\n\n350: Let's factor that. 350 divided by 2 is 175. 175 is 5^2 * 7. So 350 = 2 * 5^2 * 7.\n\nSo the common factors are the primes that appear in both factorizations. Looking at 242: primes are 2 and 11. 350: primes are 2,5,7. The common prime is 2. So the GCF is 2. Wait, but the problem states that the GCF is 11, so that's a problem.\n\nWait, that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, the formula is correct: GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a*b. So a is 350, b is x. 11*7700=350*x, which is 84700=350x, so x=242. But when I check the GCF, it's 2, not 11. That's a contradiction because the problem says GCF is 11. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the factorization of 242 and 350. Let me check again.\n\n242: 242 divided by 2 is 121, which is 11*11. So 242 is 2 * 11\u00b2.\n\n350: 350 divided by 2 is 175. 175 is 5\u00b2 * 7, so 350 is 2 *5\u00b2 *7.\n\nSo the common factors are 2. So the GCF is 2, which doesn't match the problem's GCF of 11. That suggests that 242 isn't the right answer. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation of x.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, it's correct. Hmm. Maybe I miscalculated 11 * 7700. Let me check that again.\n\n11 * 7700: 7700 * 10 is 77,000, plus 7700 is 84,700. So that's correct. 350 * x is 84,700. So x is 242. But that gives a GCF of 2, not 11. So what's wrong here?\n\nWait, maybe I used the wrong number as a. Let me think. Oh! Wait, perhaps the formula is GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a*b. So if a is 350, then b is 242, but their GCF is 2, which is wrong.\n\nSo that suggests that 242 is not the correct answer. So perhaps I made a mistake in my initial approach.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. Let's denote the two numbers as a and b. Given that GCF(a,b) = 11, which means that 11 is the greatest common factor. So both a and b are multiples of 11, but not multiples of any higher number than 11.\n\nSo perhaps I can express a and b as multiples of 11. Let me write a = 11 * m, and b = 11 * n, where m and n are integers. The GCF of a and b would then be 11 times the GCF of m and n. But since the GCF of a and b is 11, that means the GCF of m and n must be 1. So m and n are coprime.\n\nNow, the LCM of a and b would be 11 * m * n, because when you take LCM of two numbers, it's the product of the highest powers of all primes present. Since m and n are coprime, their LCM is m*n. So LCM(a,b) = 11 * m * n.\n\nWait, but the problem states that LCM(a,b) is 7700. So:\n\n11 * m * n = 7700\n\nDivide both sides by 11:\n\nm * n = 700.\n\nAlso, one of the numbers is 350. Let's say a is 350. So a = 11 * m = 350. Wait, but 350 divided by 11 is 31.818... which isn't an integer. Wait, that can't be right. Because a must be a multiple of 11. So if a is 350, then 350 must be a multiple of 11. Let me check: 11 times 31 is 341, 11 times 32 is 352. So 350 isn't a multiple of 11. That's a problem.\n\nWait a minute, that's a big issue. Because if the GCF of a and b is 11, then both a and b must be multiples of 11. So if one of them is 350, then 350 must be divisible by 11. But 350 divided by 11 is approximately 31.818, which is not an integer. So that suggests that either I'm misunderstanding the problem or there's a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, the problem says that one of the integers is 350. But 350 isn't a multiple of 11, so how can the GCF of 350 and another number be 11? Because 350's factors don't include 11. Wait, let me check the factors of 350. 350 = 2 * 5^2 *7. So it doesn't have 11 as a factor. So that can't be. So that suggests that perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check the problem. Let me read it again.\n\n\"The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700. If one of the integers is 350, what is the other?\"\n\nHmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in my approach. Because if the GCF is 11, then both numbers must be multiples of 11. But 350 isn't a multiple of 11, which would imply that the GCF can't be 11. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I've misapplied the formula. Let me think again. Maybe the formula is correct, but I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, the formula is GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a * b. So if a is 350, and the GCF is 11, then 11 * 7700 = 350 * b. So that gives 84700 = 350 * b. So b is 84700 / 350. Let me compute that again.\n\n350 * 242 is 84700, because 350 * 200 is 70,000, 350 *40=14,000 (total 84,000), and 350*2=700. So 70,000+14,000+700=84,700. So yes, 350 *242=84,700. But as I saw earlier, the GCF of 350 and 242 is 2, not 11. So that's a contradiction.\n\nSo this suggests that there's a mistake in the problem's setup, but perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the other number is a multiple of 11, but 350 isn't. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the GCF. Let me recompute the GCF of 350 and 242.\n\n350: factors are 2, 5, 5, 7.\n\n242: factors are 2, 11, 11.\n\nSo the common factors are just 2. So GCF is 2. So that's correct. So that's a problem because the problem states GCF is 11.\n\nHmm, so that suggests that perhaps the initial approach is wrong. So maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the two numbers are a = 350 and b = x, and that their GCF is 11. So 11 must divide both 350 and x. But 350 isn't divisible by 11, which is a problem.\n\nWait, that can't be. So that suggests that perhaps there's an error in the problem, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding it.\n\nWait, maybe I should re-express 350 as a multiple of 11. Let me check 350 divided by 11. 11*31 is 341, which is less than 350. 341 +11=352, which is more than 350. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. Therefore, the GCF of 350 and any other number can't be 11, because 350 itself isn't a multiple of 11. That's a problem.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the GCF is 11. So perhaps I'm missing something here. Maybe the other number is a multiple of 11, but 350 isn't. So how can the GCF be 11 if 350 isn't a multiple of 11? Because the GCF must divide both numbers. So if 11 divides both numbers, then both must be multiples of 11.\n\nSo this is a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the problem is incorrect, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the problem differently. Let me try another approach. Let's denote the two numbers as a = 350 and b = x.\n\nGiven that GCF(a,b) = 11, so 11 is the highest common factor. So 11 divides both a and b. Therefore, a must be a multiple of 11. But 350 isn't a multiple of 11. So that's impossible. Therefore, the problem is impossible as stated. But that's not an option, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 350 divided by 11. Let me compute 350 \u00f711.\n\n11*31=341. 350-341=9. So 350 \u00f711 is 31 with a remainder of 9. So it's not a whole number. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. Therefore, the GCF can't be 11 if one of the numbers is 350. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect. Let me double-check. The formula is GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b. So if a is 350, and GCF is 11, and LCM is 7700, then 11 *7700 = 350 * b. So that's correct. But when I compute b as 242, the GCF is 2, not 11. So that suggests that perhaps the initial formula is correct, but the problem is not possible as stated. So perhaps I need to re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the problem again. Oh wait! Wait a second. Wait, the problem says the GCF is 11, but the numbers are 350 and 242. So 350's factors are 2,5,5,7. 242's factors are 2,11,11. So the GCF is 2, not 11. So that's a contradiction.\n\nSo perhaps the mistake is in the problem statement. But since the options include 242, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is correct, and I'm making a mistake in my approach. Let me try to find another way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express 350 in terms of 11. Let me see, 350 divided by 11 is approximately 31.818. So that's not an integer, but maybe 350 can be expressed as 11 multiplied by something else, but I don't think so.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a step. Let me think: since GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11. But it's not. So the only conclusion is that the problem is impossible as stated. But that's not an option in the multiple-choice.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial formula. Let me recheck. GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a*b. So 11 * 7700 = 350 * x. So 84,700 = 350x. x=242. But 242 is not a multiple of 11 in a way that the GCF is 11 with 350. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Could it be that one of the numbers is 350, but the other number is not? But no, the GCF is 11, so both must be multiples of 11. So perhaps the problem is wrong, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recompute x. Let me calculate 84,700 divided by 350 again.\n\n350 times 200 is 70,000.\n\n84,700 -70,000=14,700.\n\n350 times 40 is 14,000.\n\n14,700-14,000=700.\n\n350 times 2 is 700.\n\nSo total is 200+40+2=242. So x=242.\n\nSo the calculation is correct. But then, the GCF is 2, not 11. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the LCM is not 7700 but something else. But given the options, perhaps I should proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the relationship between GCF and LCM.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the formula is GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a * b. So that's correct. So if a is 350 and GCF is 11, and LCM is 7700, then the other number must be 242. But then the GCF is 2, not 11. So that's a contradiction.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is incorrect, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the GCF.\n\nWait, let's compute GCF(350, 242) again.\n\nCompute the prime factors:\n\n350: 2 \u00d7 5\u00b2 \u00d77.\n\n242: 2 \u00d7 11\u00b2.\n\nThe common factor is 2. So GCF is 2. So that's correct.\n\nSo the problem's condition that GCF is 11 is impossible given that one number is 350. Therefore, perhaps the problem is incorrect, but the options suggest that 242 is the intended answer. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem intended the LCM to be 7700, and the GCF to be 11, but with one number being 350. So perhaps I need to find a number x such that GCF(350, x)=11 and LCM(350, x)=7700.\n\nLet me try to express x as 11 times some number k, where k and 350/11 are coprime. Wait, but 350 isn't a multiple of 11, so 350/11 isn't an integer. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Let me factor 350 and the possible options to see if any of them, when paired with 350, have GCF 11 and LCM 7700.\n\nLet me factor 350: 2 \u00d75\u00b2 \u00d77.\n\nNow, let me look at the options.\n\nOption A: 242. Factor: 2 \u00d7 11\u00b2.\n\nSo factors of 242: 2, 11, 11.\n\nFactors of 350: 2,5,5,7.\n\nSo the GCF is 2, as before. So that's not 11.\n\nOption B: 308. Let's factor 308. 308 divided by 2 is 154. Divided by 2 again is 77. 77 is 7\u00d711. So 308 is 2\u00b2 \u00d77 \u00d711.\n\nSo factors of 308: 2,2,7,11.\n\nFactors of 350: 2,5,5,7.\n\nCommon factors: 2 and 7. So GCF is 2 \u00d77=14. Which is larger than 11, which contradicts the condition. So option B is not correct.\n\nOption C:352. Let's factor 352. 352 divided by 2 is 176, divided by 2 is 88, divided by 2 is 44, divided by 2 is 22, divided by 2 is 11. So 352 is 2^5 \u00d711.\n\nFactors of 350: 2,5,5,7.\n\nCommon factors: 2. So GCF is 2, which doesn't match.\n\nOption D:412. Let's factor 412. 412 divided by 2 is 206. 206 divided by 2 is 103. 103 is a prime. So 412 is 2\u00b2 \u00d7103.\n\nFactors of 350: 2,5,5,7.\n\nCommon factors: 2. So GCF is 2.\n\nOption E:456. Let's factor 456. 456 divided by 2 is 228, divided by 2 is 114, divided by 2 is 57. 57 is 3 \u00d719. So 456 is 2\u00b3 \u00d73 \u00d719.\n\nFactors of 350: 2,5,5,7.\n\nCommon factors: 2. So GCF is 2.\n\nWait, so none of the options have a GCF of 11 with 350. That's confusing. So that suggests that the problem might have a mistake, but given the options, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I should find a number x such that GCF(350, x) is 11, and LCM(350, x) is 7700.\n\nLet me use the formula: GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a * b.\n\nSo 11 *7700 = 350 * x. So x= (11*7700)/350.\n\nCompute that: 7700/350 = 22. So x=11 *22=242.\n\nBut as before, the GCF of 350 and 242 is 2, not 11. So that's impossible. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing that 350 is not a multiple of 11, but perhaps I should adjust my approach. Let me think: since the GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11. But it's not. Therefore, perhaps the problem is incorrect, but given the options, perhaps the intended answer is 242.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think differently. Let me assume that the problem is correct and proceed.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the LCM of 350 and 242 and see if it's 7700.\n\nCompute LCM(350,242). 350 is 2 \u00d75\u00b2 \u00d77. 242 is 2 \u00d711\u00b2.\n\nThe LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes present: 2^1, 5^2,7^1,11^2.\n\nSo LCM = 2 \u00d725 \u00d77 \u00d7121.\n\nCalculate that:\n\n2 \u00d725=50.\n\n50 \u00d77=350.\n\n350 \u00d7121: Let me compute 350 \u00d7120 =42,000, plus 350 \u00d71=350. So total 42,350.\n\nWhich is way larger than 7700. So that's not correct.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because the LCM should be 7700, but 42,350 is much bigger. So that suggests that 242 is not the correct answer, which aligns with earlier findings.\n\nSo perhaps I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider that the problem has a typo, and the LCM is 7700, but perhaps the other number is a multiple of 11 and 350's factors don't include 11. But that's impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the problem again. Let me think about the prime factors.\n\nGiven that GCF(a, b) is 11, so both a and b are multiples of 11. So a =11m, b=11n, with m and n coprime.\n\nThe LCM of a and b would be 11 * m * n, because m and n are coprime.\n\nGiven that a is 350, so 350=11m. But 350 isn't a multiple of 11, so this is impossible. Therefore, there's no such integer x. So perhaps the problem is incorrect.\n\nBut given the options, perhaps the intended answer is 242, but the problem's conditions are impossible. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that 350 is a multiple of 11. But it's not, as I saw earlier. So perhaps the problem is wrong.\n\nBut since the options include 242, which is the result from the formula, perhaps the intended answer is A)242.\n\nWait, but in that case, the GCF isn't 11. So that's a problem. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think that the problem is correct, and perhaps I'm missing a step.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of 350 as 11 multiplied by some number. Let me compute 350 \u00f711. It's approximately 31.818, which isn't an integer. So that's impossible.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is wrong. But given that, perhaps the intended answer is 242, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 2, but that's not what's stated. Alternatively, perhaps the LCM is 770, not 7700.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the problem. Let me check: the LCM is 7700. So I think I read that correctly.\n\nSo I'm stuck. The formula gives 242, but the GCF isn't 11. So perhaps the problem is incorrect. But given the options, I'll choose 242 as the answer.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem states that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11, their least common multiple (LCM) is 7700, and one of the integers is 350.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple (LCM) of these two numbers is 7700. One of the integers is 350, and I need to find the other one from the given options.\n\nHmm, right. I remember that there's a relationship between the GCF and LCM of two numbers. Oh yeah, the formula is GCF(a, b) multiplied by LCM(a, b) equals the product of the two numbers a and b. So, mathematically, that's GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b.\n\nSo in this case, since the GCF is 11 and the LCM is 7700, I can plug those into the formula. Let me write that down:\n\n11 * 7700 = a * b\n\nWait, but I know one of the numbers is 350. Let's call the other number x. So, 11 * 7700 equals 350 * x. I can solve for x.\n\nFirst, let me calculate 11 multiplied by 7700. Let's see, 7700 * 10 is 77,000, so 7700 * 11 would be 77,000 + 7700 = 84,700. So 84,700 = 350 * x.\n\nNow I need to solve for x. So, x = 84,700 divided by 350. Let me compute that. Hmm, 350 goes into 84700 how many times?\n\nWait, maybe I should simplify this division. Let's see, 84,700 divided by 350. Let's break it down. Both numerator and denominator can be divided by 10, so that becomes 8,470 divided by 35.\n\nHmm, 35 times 200 is 7,000. Subtract that from 8,470, and I get 1,470 left. Now, how many times does 35 go into 1,470? Well, 35 times 42 is 1,470 because 35 times 40 is 1,400, plus 35 times 2 is 70, so 1,470. So that's 42. So adding up, 200 + 42 is 242. So x is 242.\n\nWait, but let me check the options. The options are A)242, B)308, etc. So 242 is option A.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure that 242 and 350 actually have a GCF of 11 and an LCM of 7700.\n\nLet me find the GCF of 242 and 350. First, factor both numbers.\n\n242: Let's see, it's even, so 2 * 121. 121 is 11 squared, so 242 = 2 * 11^2.\n\n350: Let's factor that. 350 divided by 2 is 175. 175 is 5^2 * 7. So 350 = 2 * 5^2 * 7.\n\nSo the common factors are the primes that appear in both factorizations. Looking at 242: primes are 2 and 11. 350: primes are 2,5,7. The common prime is 2. So the GCF is 2. Wait, but the problem states that the GCF is 11, so that's a problem.\n\nWait, that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, the formula is correct: GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a*b. So a is 350, b is x. 11*7700=350*x, which is 84700=350x, so x=242. But when I check the GCF, it's 2, not 11. That's a contradiction because the problem says GCF is 11. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the factorization of 242 and 350. Let me check again.\n\n242: 242 divided by 2 is 121, which is 11*11. So 242 is 2 * 11\u00b2.\n\n350: 350 divided by 2 is 175. 175 is 5\u00b2 * 7, so 350 is 2 *5\u00b2 *7.\n\nSo the common factors are 2. So the GCF is 2, which doesn't match the problem's GCF of 11. That suggests that 242 isn't the right answer. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation of x.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, it's correct. Hmm. Maybe I miscalculated 11 * 7700. Let me check that again.\n\n11 * 7700: 7700 * 10 is 77,000, plus 7700 is 84,700. So that's correct. 350 * x is 84,700. So x is 242. But that gives a GCF of 2, not 11. So what's wrong here?\n\nWait, maybe I used the wrong number as a. Let me think. Oh! Wait, perhaps the formula is GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a*b. So if a is 350, then b is 242, but their GCF is 2, which is wrong.\n\nSo that suggests that 242 is not the correct answer. So perhaps I made a mistake in my initial approach.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. Let's denote the two numbers as a and b. Given that GCF(a,b) = 11, which means that 11 is the greatest common factor. So both a and b are multiples of 11, but not multiples of any higher number than 11.\n\nSo perhaps I can express a and b as multiples of 11. Let me write a = 11 * m, and b = 11 * n, where m and n are integers. The GCF of a and b would then be 11 times the GCF of m and n. But since the GCF of a and b is 11, that means the GCF of m and n must be 1. So m and n are coprime.\n\nNow, the LCM of a and b would be 11 * m * n, because when you take LCM of two numbers, it's the product of the highest powers of all primes present. Since m and n are coprime, their LCM is m*n. So LCM(a,b) = 11 * m * n.\n\nWait, but the problem states that LCM(a,b) is 7700. So:\n\n11 * m * n = 7700\n\nDivide both sides by 11:\n\nm * n = 700.\n\nAlso, one of the numbers is 350. Let's say a is 350. So a = 11 * m = 350. Wait, but 350 divided by 11 is 31.818... which isn't an integer. Wait, that can't be right. Because a must be a multiple of 11. So if a is 350, then 350 must be a multiple of 11. Let me check: 11 times 31 is 341, 11 times 32 is 352. So 350 isn't a multiple of 11. That's a problem.\n\nWait a minute, that's a big issue. Because if the GCF of a and b is 11, then both a and b must be multiples of 11. So if one of them is 350, then 350 must be divisible by 11. But 350 divided by 11 is approximately 31.818, which is not an integer. So that suggests that either I'm misunderstanding the problem or there's a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, the problem says that one of the integers is 350. But 350 isn't a multiple of 11, so how can the GCF of 350 and another number be 11? Because 350's factors don't include 11. Wait, let me check the factors of 350. 350 = 2 * 5^2 *7. So it doesn't have 11 as a factor. So that can't be. So that suggests that perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check the problem. Let me read it again.\n\n\"The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700. If one of the integers is 350, what is the other?\"\n\nHmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in my approach. Because if the GCF is 11, then both numbers must be multiples of 11. But 350 isn't a multiple of 11, which would imply that the GCF can't be 11. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I've misapplied the formula. Let me think again. Maybe the formula is correct, but I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, the formula is GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a * b. So if a is 350, and the GCF is 11, then 11 * 7700 = 350 * b. So that gives 84700 = 350 * b. So b is 84700 / 350. Let me compute that again.\n\n350 * 242 is 84700, because 350 * 200 is 70,000, 350 *40=14,000 (total 84,000), and 350*2=700. So 70,000+14,000+700=84,700. So yes, 350 *242=84,700. But as I saw earlier, the GCF of 350 and 242 is 2, not 11. So that's a contradiction.\n\nSo this suggests that there's a mistake in the problem's setup, but perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the other number is a multiple of 11, but 350 isn't. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the GCF. Let me recompute the GCF of 350 and 242.\n\n350: factors are 2, 5, 5, 7.\n\n242: factors are 2, 11, 11.\n\nSo the common factors are just 2. So GCF is 2. So that's correct. So that's a problem because the problem states GCF is 11.\n\nHmm, so that suggests that perhaps the initial approach is wrong. So maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the two numbers are a = 350 and b = x, and that their GCF is 11. So 11 must divide both 350 and x. But 350 isn't divisible by 11, which is a problem.\n\nWait, that can't be. So that suggests that perhaps there's an error in the problem, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding it.\n\nWait, maybe I should re-express 350 as a multiple of 11. Let me check 350 divided by 11. 11*31 is 341, which is less than 350. 341 +11=352, which is more than 350. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. Therefore, the GCF of 350 and any other number can't be 11, because 350 itself isn't a multiple of 11. That's a problem.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the GCF is 11. So perhaps I'm missing something here. Maybe the other number is a multiple of 11, but 350 isn't. So how can the GCF be 11 if 350 isn't a multiple of 11? Because the GCF must divide both numbers. So if 11 divides both numbers, then both must be multiples of 11.\n\nSo this is a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the problem is incorrect, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the problem differently. Let me try another approach. Let's denote the two numbers as a = 350 and b = x.\n\nGiven that GCF(a,b) = 11, so 11 is the highest common factor. So 11 divides both a and b. Therefore, a must be a multiple of 11. But 350 isn't a multiple of 11. So that's impossible. Therefore, the problem is impossible as stated. But that's not an option, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 350 divided by 11. Let me compute 350 \u00f711.\n\n11*31=341. 350-341=9. So 350 \u00f711 is 31 with a remainder of 9. So it's not a whole number. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. Therefore, the GCF can't be 11 if one of the numbers is 350. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect. Let me double-check. The formula is GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b. So if a is 350, and GCF is 11, and LCM is 7700, then 11 *7700 = 350 * b. So that's correct. But when I compute b as 242, the GCF is 2, not 11. So that suggests that perhaps the initial formula is correct, but the problem is not possible as stated. So perhaps I need to re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the problem again. Oh wait! Wait a second. Wait, the problem says the GCF is 11, but the numbers are 350 and 242. So 350's factors are 2,5,5,7. 242's factors are 2,11,11. So the GCF is 2, not 11. So that's a contradiction.\n\nSo perhaps the mistake is in the problem statement. But since the options include 242, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is correct, and I'm making a mistake in my approach. Let me try to find another way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express 350 in terms of 11. Let me see, 350 divided by 11 is approximately 31.818. So that's not an integer, but maybe 350 can be expressed as 11 multiplied by something else, but I don't think so.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a step. Let me think: since GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11. But it's not. So the only conclusion is that the problem is impossible as stated. But that's not an option in the multiple-choice.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial formula. Let me recheck. GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a*b. So 11 * 7700 = 350 * x. So 84,700 = 350x. x=242. But 242 is not a multiple of 11 in a way that the GCF is 11 with 350. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Could it be that one of the numbers is 350, but the other number is not? But no, the GCF is 11, so both must be multiples of 11. So perhaps the problem is wrong, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recompute x. Let me calculate 84,700 divided by 350 again.\n\n350 times 200 is 70,000.\n\n84,700 -70,000=14,700.\n\n350 times 40 is 14,000.\n\n14,700-14,000=700.\n\n350 times 2 is 700.\n\nSo total is 200+40+2=242. So x=242.\n\nSo the calculation is correct. But then, the GCF is 2, not 11. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the LCM is not 7700 but something else. But given the options, perhaps I should proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the relationship between GCF and LCM.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the formula is GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a * b. So that's correct. So if a is 350 and GCF is 11, and LCM is 7700, then the other number must be 242. But then the GCF is 2, not 11. So that's a contradiction.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is incorrect, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the GCF.\n\nWait, let's compute GCF(350, 242) again.\n\nCompute the prime factors:\n\n350: 2 \u00d7 5\u00b2 \u00d77.\n\n242: 2 \u00d7 11\u00b2.\n\nThe common factor is 2. So GCF is 2. So that's correct.\n\nSo the problem's condition that GCF is 11 is impossible given that one number is 350. Therefore, perhaps the problem is incorrect, but the options suggest that 242 is the intended answer. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem intended the LCM to be 7700, and the GCF to be 11, but with one number being 350. So perhaps I need to find a number x such that GCF(350, x)=11 and LCM(350, x)=7700.\n\nLet me try to express x as 11 times some number k, where k and 350/11 are coprime. Wait, but 350 isn't a multiple of 11, so 350/11 isn't an integer. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Let me factor 350 and the possible options to see if any of them, when paired with 350, have GCF 11 and LCM 7700.\n\nLet me factor 350: 2 \u00d75\u00b2 \u00d77.\n\nNow, let me look at the options.\n\nOption A: 242. Factor: 2 \u00d7 11\u00b2.\n\nSo factors of 242: 2, 11, 11.\n\nFactors of 350: 2,5,5,7.\n\nSo the GCF is 2, as before. So that's not 11.\n\nOption B: 308. Let's factor 308. 308 divided by 2 is 154. Divided by 2 again is 77. 77 is 7\u00d711. So 308 is 2\u00b2 \u00d77 \u00d711.\n\nSo factors of 308: 2,2,7,11.\n\nFactors of 350: 2,5,5,7.\n\nCommon factors: 2 and 7. So GCF is 2 \u00d77=14. Which is larger than 11, which contradicts the condition. So option B is not correct.\n\nOption C:352. Let's factor 352. 352 divided by 2 is 176, divided by 2 is 88, divided by 2 is 44, divided by 2 is 22, divided by 2 is 11. So 352 is 2^5 \u00d711.\n\nFactors of 350: 2,5,5,7.\n\nCommon factors: 2. So GCF is 2, which doesn't match.\n\nOption D:412. Let's factor 412. 412 divided by 2 is 206. 206 divided by 2 is 103. 103 is a prime. So 412 is 2\u00b2 \u00d7103.\n\nFactors of 350: 2,5,5,7.\n\nCommon factors: 2. So GCF is 2.\n\nOption E:456. Let's factor 456. 456 divided by 2 is 228, divided by 2 is 114, divided by 2 is 57. 57 is 3 \u00d719. So 456 is 2\u00b3 \u00d73 \u00d719.\n\nFactors of 350: 2,5,5,7.\n\nCommon factors: 2. So GCF is 2.\n\nWait, so none of the options have a GCF of 11 with 350. That's confusing. So that suggests that the problem might have a mistake, but given the options, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I should find a number x such that GCF(350, x) is 11, and LCM(350, x) is 7700.\n\nLet me use the formula: GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a * b.\n\nSo 11 *7700 = 350 * x. So x= (11*7700)/350.\n\nCompute that: 7700/350 = 22. So x=11 *22=242.\n\nBut as before, the GCF of 350 and 242 is 2, not 11. So that's impossible. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing that 350 is not a multiple of 11, but perhaps I should adjust my approach. Let me think: since the GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11. But it's not. Therefore, perhaps the problem is incorrect, but given the options, perhaps the intended answer is 242.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think differently. Let me assume that the problem is correct and proceed.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the LCM of 350 and 242 and see if it's 7700.\n\nCompute LCM(350,242). 350 is 2 \u00d75\u00b2 \u00d77. 242 is 2 \u00d711\u00b2.\n\nThe LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes present: 2^1, 5^2,7^1,11^2.\n\nSo LCM = 2 \u00d725 \u00d77 \u00d7121.\n\nCalculate that:\n\n2 \u00d725=50.\n\n50 \u00d77=350.\n\n350 \u00d7121: Let me compute 350 \u00d7120 =42,000, plus 350 \u00d71=350. So total 42,350.\n\nWhich is way larger than 7700. So that's not correct.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because the LCM should be 7700, but 42,350 is much bigger. So that suggests that 242 is not the correct answer, which aligns with earlier findings.\n\nSo perhaps I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider that the problem has a typo, and the LCM is 7700, but perhaps the other number is a multiple of 11 and 350's factors don't include 11. But that's impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the problem again. Let me think about the prime factors.\n\nGiven that GCF(a, b) is 11, so both a and b are multiples of 11. So a =11m, b=11n, with m and n coprime.\n\nThe LCM of a and b would be 11 * m * n, because m and n are coprime.\n\nGiven that a is 350, so 350=11m. But 350 isn't a multiple of 11, so this is impossible. Therefore, there's no such integer x. So perhaps the problem is incorrect.\n\nBut given the options, perhaps the intended answer is 242, but the problem's conditions are impossible. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that 350 is a multiple of 11. But it's not, as I saw earlier. So perhaps the problem is wrong.\n\nBut since the options include 242, which is the result from the formula, perhaps the intended answer is A)242.\n\nWait, but in that case, the GCF isn't 11. So that's a problem. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think that the problem is correct, and perhaps I'm missing a step.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of 350 as 11 multiplied by some number. Let me compute 350 \u00f711. It's approximately 31.818, which isn't an integer. So that's impossible.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is wrong. But given that, perhaps the intended answer is 242, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 2, but that's not what's stated. Alternatively, perhaps the LCM is 770, not 7700.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the problem. Let me check: the LCM is 7700. So I think I read that correctly.\n\nSo I'm stuck. The formula gives 242, but the GCF isn't 11. So perhaps the problem is incorrect. But given the options, I'll choose 242 as the answer.\n\n\nThe problem states that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11, their least common multiple (LCM) is 7700, and one of the integers is 350. The task is to find the other integer from the given options.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Relationship Between GCF and LCM**:  \n   The formula connecting GCF and LCM is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{GCF}(a, b) \\times \\text{LCM}(a, b) = a \\times b\n   \\]  \n   Substituting the given values:  \n   \\[\n   11 \\times 7700 = 350 \\times x\n   \\]  \n   Simplifying:  \n   \\[\n   84700 = 350 \\times x \\implies x = \\frac{84700}{350} = 242\n   \\]\n\n2. **Verification of GCF**:  \n   To ensure the GCF of 350 and 242 is 11, factorize both numbers:  \n   - \\(350 = 2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7\\)  \n   - \\(242 = 2 \\times 11^2\\)  \n   The common prime factor is \\(2\\), so the GCF is \\(2\\), not \\(11\\). This contradicts the problem's condition that the GCF is \\(11\\).\n\n3. **Analysis of Options**:  \n   Each option was factored to check if it could satisfy the conditions with 350:  \n   - **A) 242**: GCF with 350 is \\(2\\), not \\(11\\).  \n   - **B) 308**: GCF with 350 is \\(14\\), not \\(11\\).  \n   - **C) 352**: GCF with 350 is \\(2\\), not \\(11\\).  \n   - **D) 412**: GCF with 350 is \\(2\\), not \\(11\\).  \n   - **E) 456**: GCF with 350 is \\(2\\), not \\(11\\).  \n\n4. **Conclusion**:  \n   None of the options satisfy the condition that the GCF is \\(11\\). However, the formula yields \\(x = 242\\), which is the only plausible answer despite the inconsistency in the GCF.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe problem's conditions are contradictory, but based on the formula and the given options, the intended answer is:  \n**Answer: A**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the other integer when the greatest common factor (GCF) and least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers are given. One of the numbers is 350, and I need to find the other. Hmm, I remember that GCF and LCM are related to each other and the numbers in some way. Let me think.\n\nWait, right! There's a formula that connects GCF and LCM of two numbers. I think it's something like the product of the two numbers equals the product of their GCF and LCM. Oh wait, yes! So, if the two numbers are a and b, then a * b = GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b). So that's the key here.\n\nGiven that the GCF is 11 and the LCM is 7700. One of the numbers is 350, let's call that a = 350. So I can set up the equation: 350 * b = 11 * 7700.\n\nLet me calculate the right side first. 11 multiplied by 7700. 11 times 7000 is 77000, and 11 times 700 is 7700. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 7700 is already 7000 + 700? No, 7700 is 7000 + 700? Wait, 7000 is 7 * 1000, and 700 is 7*100, so 7000 + 700 is 7700. So 11 * 7700 is 11*7000 + 11*700. 11*7000 is 77000, 11*700 is 7700. So adding those together, 77000 + 7700 is 84700. So 350 * b = 84700.\n\nWait, no, wait a second. Wait, 7700 * 11. Let me compute that directly. 7700 * 10 is 77000, plus 7700 is 84700. Yep, that's correct. So 350 * b = 84700. So to find b, I can divide 84700 by 350.\n\nLet me compute that. 84700 divided by 350. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to simplify both numbers by dividing numerator and denominator by 50. 350 divided by 50 is 7, and 84700 divided by 50 is 1694. So now it's 1694 divided by 7. Let me see, 7 times 242 is 1694 because 240 *7 is 1680, and 2*7 is 14, so 1680+14=1694. So b is 242. Wait, that's option A.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I did everything correctly. Because 350 and 242, their GCF is 11? Let me check. Hmm. So 350 is 2 * 5^2 * 7. 242 is 2 * 11^2. So the GCF is the product of the smallest powers of the common primes. The primes in 350 are 2,5,7. In 242, it's 2 and 11. So the only common prime is 2, and the smallest exponent is 1. So GCF should be 2. But wait, the problem says GCF is 11. That's a problem. Hmm, did I make a mistake here?\n\nWait, that can't be right. If the GCF is 11, then both numbers must be multiples of 11. So 350 is one of the numbers. Wait, is 350 divisible by 11? Let me check: 350 divided by 11 is 31.818... which is not an integer. Oh! Wait a minute, that's a problem. Because if 350 and the other number have GCF 11, then 11 must divide both numbers. But 350 is not divisible by 11. Because 350 \u00f7 11 is about 31.8, which isn't an integer. So that can't be right. So my initial approach must have a mistake.\n\nOh no! So where did I go wrong? Because according to the formula, a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So a=350, GCF=11, LCM=7700. So 350 * b = 11 *7700 = 84700. So b=84700 /350 = 242. But 350 and 242 don't have a GCF of 11. So something's wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation. Let me recheck 350 divided by 11. 11*31 is 341. 350-341=9. So 350 is 11*31 +9, which is not divisible by 11. So that can't be.\n\nSo what's wrong here? Because according to the formula, I should get b as 242, but then the GCF isn't 11. So maybe I messed up the formula. Wait, no, the formula is correct: a * b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So if the GCF is 11, then both a and b must be multiples of 11. But 350 isn't a multiple of 11. So that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, so perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, but that's unlikely. Or perhaps I've made a wrong assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Wait, no, the formula is correct. So the only conclusion is that the other number, b, must be a multiple of 11, but a=350 isn't, which is a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine my calculation. Let me compute 350 * b = 11 * 7700. Let me compute 11 *7700 again. 7700 *10 is 77000, plus 7700 is 84700. So 350*b=84700. So b=84700/350. Let me compute 84700 divided by 350 again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can simplify the division. Let me write 350 as 35 *10, and 84700 as 847 *100. So 84700 /350 = (847 *100) / (35 *10) )= (847/35) * (100/10) )= (847/35)*10. Now, 35 is 5*7. Let's see if 847 is divisible by 35. 35*24 is 840. 847-840=7. So 847=35*24 +7. So 847/35=24 +7/35=24.2. So 24.2 *10=242. So same as before, 242.\n\nBut 242 is 2 * 11^2. 350 is 2 *5^2 *7. So GCF is 2. But the problem states the GCF is 11. So this is impossible. So I'm stuck here.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me double-check. Oh wait! Wait a second. The formula is correct: a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So if a=350, and GCF(a,b)=11, then 350 must be a multiple of 11. Because GCF is 11, which divides both a and b. So 350 must be divisible by 11, but as I saw, it isn't. So that's a problem.\n\nSo perhaps the problem has a typo, but since it's a multiple-choice question, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if 350 and 242 actually have a GCF of 11. Let's compute GCF(350,242). To find the GCF, I can use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nGCF(350,242) = GCF(242, 350 mod 242). 350 mod 242 is 350 - 242 = 108. So GCF(242,108).\n\nNow, 242 mod 108. 108*2=216, 242-216=26. So GCF(108,26).\n\n108 mod 26: 26*4=104, 108-104=4. So GCF(26,4).\n\n26 mod 4=2. GCF(4,2)=2. So GCF is 2. Which contradicts the problem statement, which says the GCF is 11. So something is wrong.\n\nWait, so according to the problem, the GCF is 11, but according to my calculation, it's 2. So that suggests that either I'm using the wrong formula or perhaps there's a mistake in the problem.\n\nWait, but the formula is correct. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but that's not an option here. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. Let me think about the problem again. The two numbers have a GCF of 11, so I can write them as 11*m and 11*n, where m and n are integers that are co-prime (since any common factor would increase the GCF beyond 11).\n\nSo, let the two numbers be 11m and 11n, with m and n co-prime. Then, the LCM of the two numbers is 11*m*n, because LCM of 11m and 11n is 11*m*n since m and n are co-prime.\n\nWait, but the LCM is given as 7700. So 11 * m * n =7700. So m *n=7700/11=700. So m *n=700.\n\nNow, one of the numbers is 350. So either 11m=350 or 11n=350.\n\nLet me check if 350 is divisible by 11. 350 \u00f711 is approximately 31.818, which is not an integer. So 11m=350 implies m is not an integer, which is impossible. Therefore, 11n=350. So n=350/11, which is about 31.818, which is not an integer either. So that can't be.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Both possibilities lead to non-integer m or n, which can't be since m and n are integers. So this suggests that the problem is impossible as stated, but since this is a multiple-choice question, perhaps I made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps the numbers are 11m and 11n, but one of them is 350, so 350 must be equal to 11m or 11n. But 350 isn't divisible by 11, so that's impossible. So perhaps the problem has a mistake, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in another way.\n\nWait, maybe I should think that the formula a*b = GCF(a,b)*LCM(a,b) is correct, but in this case, the numbers might have a GCF of 11, but 350 isn't a multiple of 11. So perhaps the problem is wrong, but that's not an option here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if I made a mistake in the calculation of 84700/350. Let me compute that again. 350 times 242 is 350*200=70,000, 350*40=14,000, 350*2=700. So 70,000 +14,000=84,000 plus 700 is 84,700. Yes, so 350*242=84700, which equals 11 *7700=84700. So that's correct.\n\nBut then the GCF is 2, not 11. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but that's not possible. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the numbers in terms of their prime factors. Let's factor 350: 350 = 2 * 5^2 * 7.\n\nThe other number is 242. 242 = 2 * 11^2. So the GCF is the product of the minimum exponents of the shared primes. The primes in 350 are 2,5,7; in 242, 2 and 11. So the only shared prime is 2, so GCF is 2. But the problem says GCF is 11. So that's impossible. So perhaps the correct answer is not 242, but I'm not seeing it.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, it must be 242. So why is the GCF wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation of the GCF. Let me check again. 350 is 2 *5^2 *7. 242 is 2 *11^2. So the common prime is 2, so GCF is 2. So the problem states GCF is 11, which would require that both numbers are multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11, but it's not. So perhaps the problem has an error, but since this is a test question, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the formula is correct, but the way I applied it is wrong. Let me re-express it. Let a and b be the two numbers. GCF(a,b)=11, LCM(a,b)=7700, and a=350. So a*b=11*7700=84700. So b=84700 /350=242.\n\nBut GCF(a,b)=11. Let's compute GCF(350,242). 350=2*5^2*7, 242=2*11^2. So the common factor is 2. So GCF is 2, not 11. Which contradicts the problem statement. So this suggests that there's a mistake in the problem, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says that the greatest common factor is 11, but perhaps I misread. Let me check the problem again. \"The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700. If one of the integers is 350, what is the other?\"\n\nHmm, that's what it says. So maybe the answer is 242, but then the problem's GCF is wrong. Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if 350 and 242 have a GCF of 11. Let me compute GCF(350,242) again.\n\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm:\n\nGCF(350,242) = GCF(242, 350 mod 242). 350 mod 242 is 108, as 242 *1 =242, 350-242=108.\n\nSo GCF(242,108).\n\n242 \u00f7 108 = 2 with a remainder of 26 (108*2=216; 242-216=26).\n\nSo GCF(108,26).\n\n108 \u00f726=4 with remainder 4 (26*4=104; 108-104=4).\n\nSo GCF(26,4).\n\n26 \u00f74=6 with remainder 2.\n\nGCF(4,2)=2.\n\nSo yes, GCF is 2. So the problem's condition can't be satisfied. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but that can't be the case.\n\nWait, but perhaps the formula I used is wrong. Let me think again. Wait, no, the formula a*b = GCF(a,b)*LCM(a,b) is correct. So perhaps the problem is correct, but I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another thought. Maybe I should factor 350 and the other number and see how they can have a GCF of 11.\n\nSo 350 = 2 *5^2 *7.\n\nThe other number must be a multiple of 11, but also share no other factors with 350 except 11. Because the GCF is 11, so the other number must have 11 as a factor, but not 2,5, or 7.\n\nWait, but 350 is 2 *5^2 *7. So the other number must be 11 times some number that is co-prime with 350/11, but wait, 350 isn't a multiple of 11, so that's impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps the other number is 11 times some number that doesn't share factors with 350. Let me think. Let me call the other number 11k, where k is an integer that is co-prime with 350/ GCF(350,11k). But since GCF(350,11k)=11, that implies that 11 divides both numbers, but 350 isn't divisible by 11. So that's impossible. So that suggests that the problem's condition is impossible, which can't be.\n\nBut since this is a multiple-choice question, perhaps the answer is 242, even though it contradicts the GCF condition. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, another approach: Perhaps the numbers are 350 and 242, and the GCF is 2, but the problem says it's 11. So maybe the problem has a mistake, but perhaps I should choose the option that fits the formula, which is 242, option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps the LCM is 7700, which is 77 * 100. 77 is 7*11, and 100 is 2^2*5^2. So LCM of 350 and the other number is 7700. Let me factor 350: 2 *5^2 *7. So the other number must have factors such that the LCM includes 2,5^2,7, and 11^2 (since 7700=2^2 *5^2 *7 * 11^2).\n\nSo the other number must have 11^2 as a factor, and perhaps 2^2 or something else. Let me see. So if the other number is 2^2 * 11^2, which is 4 * 121 = 484. But 484 isn't an option. Alternatively, 2 *11^2=242, which is option A.\n\nWait, so if the other number is 242, which is 2*11^2, then the LCM of 350 and 242 is LCM(2*5^2*7, 2*11^2) = 2^1 *5^2 *7^1 *11^2 = 2 *25 *7 *121. Let me compute that: 2*25=50, 50*7=350, 350*121=42350. But the LCM is supposed to be 7700. So that's way too big. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the other number has to have factors that when combined with 350, the LCM is 7700.\n\nWait, 7700 factors: 7700 = 77 * 100 = (7*11) * (2^2 *5^2) = 2^2 *5^2 *7 *11.\n\nSo the LCM of 350 and the other number must have exponents equal to the max exponents from both numbers.\n\n350 is 2^1 *5^2 *7^1.\n\nSo the other number must contribute 11^1 and the exponents for other primes must not exceed those in 350.\n\nWait, because the LCM is 2^2 *5^2 *7^1 *11^1.\n\nSo the other number must have 2^2, 5^0 (since 5^2 is already present), 7^0 (since 7 is present), and 11^1.\n\nSo the other number must be 2^2 *11^1 =4*11=44.\n\nBut 44 isn't an option. The options are 242, 308, 352, 412, 456.\n\nWait, but 44 is not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the other number is 2^1 *11^2, which is 2*121=242. So the LCM of 350 (2*5^2*7) and 242 (2*11^2) would be 2^1 *5^2 *7^1 *11^2.\n\nWhich is 2*25*7*121=2*25=50, 50*7=350, 350*121=42350. But the LCM is supposed to be 7700, which is much smaller. So that can't be.\n\nHmm, perhaps the other number is 2^2 *5^0 *7^0 *11^1, which is 4*11=44. Again, not an option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other number has 5 as a factor. Let me think. Suppose the other number is 2^2 *5^1 *11^1. That would be 4 *5 *11= 220. Is 220 an option? Let me check the options: A)242, B)308, C)352, D)412, E)456. No, 220 isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other number has 7 as a factor. Suppose it's 2^2 *7^1 *11^1. That would be 4 *7 *11=308. Oh, option B is 308.\n\nSo let's test that. If the other number is 308, which is 4*77=4*7*11. So 308=2^2 *7 *11.\n\nSo the two numbers are 350=2 *5^2 *7, and 308=2^2 *7 *11.\n\nThe GCF would be the product of the minimum exponents of the common primes. Common primes are 2 and 7.\n\nFor 2: min(1,2)=1.\n\nFor 7: min(1,1)=1.\n\nSo GCF is 2^1 *7^1=14. But the problem says GCF is 11, so that's not correct.\n\nHmm. So that's not working.\n\nAnother option: Let's try option B, 308.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the GCF of 350 and 308.\n\n350=2*5^2*7.\n\n308=2^2 *7 *11.\n\nSo GCF is 2*7=14, as above. So that's not 11.\n\nNext option, C)352. Let me factor 352. 352 divided by 2: 352/2=176, /2=88, /2=44, /2=22, /2=11. So 352=2^5 *11.\n\nSo 352 is 2^5 *11.\n\n350 is 2 *5^2 *7.\n\nSo GCF is 2^1=2. Which isn't 11.\n\nSo that's not correct.\n\nOption D)412. Let's factor 412. 412 \u00f72=206, \u00f72=103. 103 is a prime. So 412=2^2 *103.\n\n350 is 2 *5^2 *7.\n\nSo GCF is 2^1=2. Not 11.\n\nOption E)456. Let's factor 456. 456 \u00f72=228, \u00f72=114, \u00f72=57, which is 3*19. So 456=2^3 *3 *19.\n\n350 is 2 *5^2 *7.\n\nSo GCF is 2. Not 11.\n\nHmm, so none of the options, when multiplied by 350, gives a product of 11*7700=84700, except option A, 242. But that gives a GCF of 2, not 11.\n\nWait, so perhaps the correct answer is option B, 308, but that gives a GCF of 14, which isn't 11 either.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should go back to the formula. The formula says a*b= GCF(a,b)*LCM(a,b). So 350*b=11*7700=84700. So b=242.\n\nBut then the GCF is 2, which doesn't match. So perhaps the problem is wrong, but since I have to choose from the options, perhaps the intended answer is A)242, despite the inconsistency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the GCF. Let me think again. 350=2*5^2*7. 242=2*11^2.\n\nSo the GCF is 2, because that's the only common prime. So that's correct. So the problem's statement about GCF being 11 is wrong, but since I have to choose an option, I'll go with 242, option A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves finding the other integer when the greatest common factor (GCF) is 11, the least common multiple (LCM) is 7700, and one of the integers is 350. The relationship between GCF and LCM is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\na \\times b = \\text{GCF}(a, b) \\times \\text{LCM}(a, b)\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(a = 350\\), \\(\\text{GCF}(a, b) = 11\\), and \\(\\text{LCM}(a, b) = 7700\\).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the other integer when the greatest common factor (GCF) and least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers are given. One of the numbers is 350, and I need to find the other. Hmm, I remember that GCF and LCM are related to each other and the numbers in some way. Let me think.\n\nWait, right! There's a formula that connects GCF and LCM of two numbers. I think it's something like the product of the two numbers equals the product of their GCF and LCM. Oh wait, yes! So, if the two numbers are a and b, then a * b = GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b). So that's the key here.\n\nGiven that the GCF is 11 and the LCM is 7700. One of the numbers is 350, let's call that a = 350. So I can set up the equation: 350 * b = 11 * 7700.\n\nLet me calculate the right side first. 11 multiplied by 7700. 11 times 7000 is 77000, and 11 times 700 is 7700. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 7700 is already 7000 + 700? No, 7700 is 7000 + 700? Wait, 7000 is 7 * 1000, and 700 is 7*100, so 7000 + 700 is 7700. So 11 * 7700 is 11*7000 + 11*700. 11*7000 is 77000, 11*700 is 7700. So adding those together, 77000 + 7700 is 84700. So 350 * b = 84700.\n\nWait, no, wait a second. Wait, 7700 * 11. Let me compute that directly. 7700 * 10 is 77000, plus 7700 is 84700. Yep, that's correct. So 350 * b = 84700. So to find b, I can divide 84700 by 350.\n\nLet me compute that. 84700 divided by 350. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to simplify both numbers by dividing numerator and denominator by 50. 350 divided by 50 is 7, and 84700 divided by 50 is 1694. So now it's 1694 divided by 7. Let me see, 7 times 242 is 1694 because 240 *7 is 1680, and 2*7 is 14, so 1680+14=1694. So b is 242. Wait, that's option A.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I did everything correctly. Because 350 and 242, their GCF is 11? Let me check. Hmm. So 350 is 2 * 5^2 * 7. 242 is 2 * 11^2. So the GCF is the product of the smallest powers of the common primes. The primes in 350 are 2,5,7. In 242, it's 2 and 11. So the only common prime is 2, and the smallest exponent is 1. So GCF should be 2. But wait, the problem says GCF is 11. That's a problem. Hmm, did I make a mistake here?\n\nWait, that can't be right. If the GCF is 11, then both numbers must be multiples of 11. So 350 is one of the numbers. Wait, is 350 divisible by 11? Let me check: 350 divided by 11 is 31.818... which is not an integer. Oh! Wait a minute, that's a problem. Because if 350 and the other number have GCF 11, then 11 must divide both numbers. But 350 is not divisible by 11. Because 350 \u00f7 11 is about 31.8, which isn't an integer. So that can't be right. So my initial approach must have a mistake.\n\nOh no! So where did I go wrong? Because according to the formula, a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So a=350, GCF=11, LCM=7700. So 350 * b = 11 *7700 = 84700. So b=84700 /350 = 242. But 350 and 242 don't have a GCF of 11. So something's wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation. Let me recheck 350 divided by 11. 11*31 is 341. 350-341=9. So 350 is 11*31 +9, which is not divisible by 11. So that can't be.\n\nSo what's wrong here? Because according to the formula, I should get b as 242, but then the GCF isn't 11. So maybe I messed up the formula. Wait, no, the formula is correct: a * b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So if the GCF is 11, then both a and b must be multiples of 11. But 350 isn't a multiple of 11. So that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, so perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, but that's unlikely. Or perhaps I've made a wrong assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Wait, no, the formula is correct. So the only conclusion is that the other number, b, must be a multiple of 11, but a=350 isn't, which is a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine my calculation. Let me compute 350 * b = 11 * 7700. Let me compute 11 *7700 again. 7700 *10 is 77000, plus 7700 is 84700. So 350*b=84700. So b=84700/350. Let me compute 84700 divided by 350 again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can simplify the division. Let me write 350 as 35 *10, and 84700 as 847 *100. So 84700 /350 = (847 *100) / (35 *10) )= (847/35) * (100/10) )= (847/35)*10. Now, 35 is 5*7. Let's see if 847 is divisible by 35. 35*24 is 840. 847-840=7. So 847=35*24 +7. So 847/35=24 +7/35=24.2. So 24.2 *10=242. So same as before, 242.\n\nBut 242 is 2 * 11^2. 350 is 2 *5^2 *7. So GCF is 2. But the problem states the GCF is 11. So this is impossible. So I'm stuck here.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me double-check. Oh wait! Wait a second. The formula is correct: a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So if a=350, and GCF(a,b)=11, then 350 must be a multiple of 11. Because GCF is 11, which divides both a and b. So 350 must be divisible by 11, but as I saw, it isn't. So that's a problem.\n\nSo perhaps the problem has a typo, but since it's a multiple-choice question, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if 350 and 242 actually have a GCF of 11. Let's compute GCF(350,242). To find the GCF, I can use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nGCF(350,242) = GCF(242, 350 mod 242). 350 mod 242 is 350 - 242 = 108. So GCF(242,108).\n\nNow, 242 mod 108. 108*2=216, 242-216=26. So GCF(108,26).\n\n108 mod 26: 26*4=104, 108-104=4. So GCF(26,4).\n\n26 mod 4=2. GCF(4,2)=2. So GCF is 2. Which contradicts the problem statement, which says the GCF is 11. So something is wrong.\n\nWait, so according to the problem, the GCF is 11, but according to my calculation, it's 2. So that suggests that either I'm using the wrong formula or perhaps there's a mistake in the problem.\n\nWait, but the formula is correct. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but that's not an option here. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. Let me think about the problem again. The two numbers have a GCF of 11, so I can write them as 11*m and 11*n, where m and n are integers that are co-prime (since any common factor would increase the GCF beyond 11).\n\nSo, let the two numbers be 11m and 11n, with m and n co-prime. Then, the LCM of the two numbers is 11*m*n, because LCM of 11m and 11n is 11*m*n since m and n are co-prime.\n\nWait, but the LCM is given as 7700. So 11 * m * n =7700. So m *n=7700/11=700. So m *n=700.\n\nNow, one of the numbers is 350. So either 11m=350 or 11n=350.\n\nLet me check if 350 is divisible by 11. 350 \u00f711 is approximately 31.818, which is not an integer. So 11m=350 implies m is not an integer, which is impossible. Therefore, 11n=350. So n=350/11, which is about 31.818, which is not an integer either. So that can't be.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Both possibilities lead to non-integer m or n, which can't be since m and n are integers. So this suggests that the problem is impossible as stated, but since this is a multiple-choice question, perhaps I made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps the numbers are 11m and 11n, but one of them is 350, so 350 must be equal to 11m or 11n. But 350 isn't divisible by 11, so that's impossible. So perhaps the problem has a mistake, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in another way.\n\nWait, maybe I should think that the formula a*b = GCF(a,b)*LCM(a,b) is correct, but in this case, the numbers might have a GCF of 11, but 350 isn't a multiple of 11. So perhaps the problem is wrong, but that's not an option here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if I made a mistake in the calculation of 84700/350. Let me compute that again. 350 times 242 is 350*200=70,000, 350*40=14,000, 350*2=700. So 70,000 +14,000=84,000 plus 700 is 84,700. Yes, so 350*242=84700, which equals 11 *7700=84700. So that's correct.\n\nBut then the GCF is 2, not 11. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but that's not possible. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the numbers in terms of their prime factors. Let's factor 350: 350 = 2 * 5^2 * 7.\n\nThe other number is 242. 242 = 2 * 11^2. So the GCF is the product of the minimum exponents of the shared primes. The primes in 350 are 2,5,7; in 242, 2 and 11. So the only shared prime is 2, so GCF is 2. But the problem says GCF is 11. So that's impossible. So perhaps the correct answer is not 242, but I'm not seeing it.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, it must be 242. So why is the GCF wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation of the GCF. Let me check again. 350 is 2 *5^2 *7. 242 is 2 *11^2. So the common prime is 2, so GCF is 2. So the problem states GCF is 11, which would require that both numbers are multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11, but it's not. So perhaps the problem has an error, but since this is a test question, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the formula is correct, but the way I applied it is wrong. Let me re-express it. Let a and b be the two numbers. GCF(a,b)=11, LCM(a,b)=7700, and a=350. So a*b=11*7700=84700. So b=84700 /350=242.\n\nBut GCF(a,b)=11. Let's compute GCF(350,242). 350=2*5^2*7, 242=2*11^2. So the common factor is 2. So GCF is 2, not 11. Which contradicts the problem statement. So this suggests that there's a mistake in the problem, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says that the greatest common factor is 11, but perhaps I misread. Let me check the problem again. \"The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700. If one of the integers is 350, what is the other?\"\n\nHmm, that's what it says. So maybe the answer is 242, but then the problem's GCF is wrong. Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if 350 and 242 have a GCF of 11. Let me compute GCF(350,242) again.\n\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm:\n\nGCF(350,242) = GCF(242, 350 mod 242). 350 mod 242 is 108, as 242 *1 =242, 350-242=108.\n\nSo GCF(242,108).\n\n242 \u00f7 108 = 2 with a remainder of 26 (108*2=216; 242-216=26).\n\nSo GCF(108,26).\n\n108 \u00f726=4 with remainder 4 (26*4=104; 108-104=4).\n\nSo GCF(26,4).\n\n26 \u00f74=6 with remainder 2.\n\nGCF(4,2)=2.\n\nSo yes, GCF is 2. So the problem's condition can't be satisfied. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but that can't be the case.\n\nWait, but perhaps the formula I used is wrong. Let me think again. Wait, no, the formula a*b = GCF(a,b)*LCM(a,b) is correct. So perhaps the problem is correct, but I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another thought. Maybe I should factor 350 and the other number and see how they can have a GCF of 11.\n\nSo 350 = 2 *5^2 *7.\n\nThe other number must be a multiple of 11, but also share no other factors with 350 except 11. Because the GCF is 11, so the other number must have 11 as a factor, but not 2,5, or 7.\n\nWait, but 350 is 2 *5^2 *7. So the other number must be 11 times some number that is co-prime with 350/11, but wait, 350 isn't a multiple of 11, so that's impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps the other number is 11 times some number that doesn't share factors with 350. Let me think. Let me call the other number 11k, where k is an integer that is co-prime with 350/ GCF(350,11k). But since GCF(350,11k)=11, that implies that 11 divides both numbers, but 350 isn't divisible by 11. So that's impossible. So that suggests that the problem's condition is impossible, which can't be.\n\nBut since this is a multiple-choice question, perhaps the answer is 242, even though it contradicts the GCF condition. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, another approach: Perhaps the numbers are 350 and 242, and the GCF is 2, but the problem says it's 11. So maybe the problem has a mistake, but perhaps I should choose the option that fits the formula, which is 242, option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps the LCM is 7700, which is 77 * 100. 77 is 7*11, and 100 is 2^2*5^2. So LCM of 350 and the other number is 7700. Let me factor 350: 2 *5^2 *7. So the other number must have factors such that the LCM includes 2,5^2,7, and 11^2 (since 7700=2^2 *5^2 *7 * 11^2).\n\nSo the other number must have 11^2 as a factor, and perhaps 2^2 or something else. Let me see. So if the other number is 2^2 * 11^2, which is 4 * 121 = 484. But 484 isn't an option. Alternatively, 2 *11^2=242, which is option A.\n\nWait, so if the other number is 242, which is 2*11^2, then the LCM of 350 and 242 is LCM(2*5^2*7, 2*11^2) = 2^1 *5^2 *7^1 *11^2 = 2 *25 *7 *121. Let me compute that: 2*25=50, 50*7=350, 350*121=42350. But the LCM is supposed to be 7700. So that's way too big. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the other number has to have factors that when combined with 350, the LCM is 7700.\n\nWait, 7700 factors: 7700 = 77 * 100 = (7*11) * (2^2 *5^2) = 2^2 *5^2 *7 *11.\n\nSo the LCM of 350 and the other number must have exponents equal to the max exponents from both numbers.\n\n350 is 2^1 *5^2 *7^1.\n\nSo the other number must contribute 11^1 and the exponents for other primes must not exceed those in 350.\n\nWait, because the LCM is 2^2 *5^2 *7^1 *11^1.\n\nSo the other number must have 2^2, 5^0 (since 5^2 is already present), 7^0 (since 7 is present), and 11^1.\n\nSo the other number must be 2^2 *11^1 =4*11=44.\n\nBut 44 isn't an option. The options are 242, 308, 352, 412, 456.\n\nWait, but 44 is not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the other number is 2^1 *11^2, which is 2*121=242. So the LCM of 350 (2*5^2*7) and 242 (2*11^2) would be 2^1 *5^2 *7^1 *11^2.\n\nWhich is 2*25*7*121=2*25=50, 50*7=350, 350*121=42350. But the LCM is supposed to be 7700, which is much smaller. So that can't be.\n\nHmm, perhaps the other number is 2^2 *5^0 *7^0 *11^1, which is 4*11=44. Again, not an option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other number has 5 as a factor. Let me think. Suppose the other number is 2^2 *5^1 *11^1. That would be 4 *5 *11= 220. Is 220 an option? Let me check the options: A)242, B)308, C)352, D)412, E)456. No, 220 isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other number has 7 as a factor. Suppose it's 2^2 *7^1 *11^1. That would be 4 *7 *11=308. Oh, option B is 308.\n\nSo let's test that. If the other number is 308, which is 4*77=4*7*11. So 308=2^2 *7 *11.\n\nSo the two numbers are 350=2 *5^2 *7, and 308=2^2 *7 *11.\n\nThe GCF would be the product of the minimum exponents of the common primes. Common primes are 2 and 7.\n\nFor 2: min(1,2)=1.\n\nFor 7: min(1,1)=1.\n\nSo GCF is 2^1 *7^1=14. But the problem says GCF is 11, so that's not correct.\n\nHmm. So that's not working.\n\nAnother option: Let's try option B, 308.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the GCF of 350 and 308.\n\n350=2*5^2*7.\n\n308=2^2 *7 *11.\n\nSo GCF is 2*7=14, as above. So that's not 11.\n\nNext option, C)352. Let me factor 352. 352 divided by 2: 352/2=176, /2=88, /2=44, /2=22, /2=11. So 352=2^5 *11.\n\nSo 352 is 2^5 *11.\n\n350 is 2 *5^2 *7.\n\nSo GCF is 2^1=2. Which isn't 11.\n\nSo that's not correct.\n\nOption D)412. Let's factor 412. 412 \u00f72=206, \u00f72=103. 103 is a prime. So 412=2^2 *103.\n\n350 is 2 *5^2 *7.\n\nSo GCF is 2^1=2. Not 11.\n\nOption E)456. Let's factor 456. 456 \u00f72=228, \u00f72=114, \u00f72=57, which is 3*19. So 456=2^3 *3 *19.\n\n350 is 2 *5^2 *7.\n\nSo GCF is 2. Not 11.\n\nHmm, so none of the options, when multiplied by 350, gives a product of 11*7700=84700, except option A, 242. But that gives a GCF of 2, not 11.\n\nWait, so perhaps the correct answer is option B, 308, but that gives a GCF of 14, which isn't 11 either.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should go back to the formula. The formula says a*b= GCF(a,b)*LCM(a,b). So 350*b=11*7700=84700. So b=242.\n\nBut then the GCF is 2, which doesn't match. So perhaps the problem is wrong, but since I have to choose from the options, perhaps the intended answer is A)242, despite the inconsistency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the GCF. Let me think again. 350=2*5^2*7. 242=2*11^2.\n\nSo the GCF is 2, because that's the only common prime. So that's correct. So the problem's statement about GCF being 11 is wrong, but since I have to choose an option, I'll go with 242, option A.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the other integer when the greatest common factor (GCF) is 11, the least common multiple (LCM) is 7700, and one of the integers is 350. The relationship between GCF and LCM is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\na \\times b = \\text{GCF}(a, b) \\times \\text{LCM}(a, b)\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(a = 350\\), \\(\\text{GCF}(a, b) = 11\\), and \\(\\text{LCM}(a, b) = 7700\\). Substituting these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n350 \\times b = 11 \\times 7700\n\\]\n\nCalculating the right-hand side:\n\n\\[\n11 \\times 7700 = 84700\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\n350 \\times b = 84700\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(b\\):\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{84700}{350} = 242\n\\]\n\nThe other integer is \\(b = 242\\). However, a contradiction arises when checking the GCF of 350 and 242. Factoring both numbers:\n\n\\[\n350 = 2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7, \\quad 242 = 2 \\times 11^2\n\\]\n\nThe GCF is the product of the smallest powers of the common prime factors. The only common prime factor is 2, so:\n\n\\[\n\\text{GCF}(350, 242) = 2\n\\]\n\nThis contradicts the problem's statement that the GCF is 11. Despite this inconsistency, the formula \\(a \\times b = \\text{GCF}(a, b) \\times \\text{LCM}(a, b)\\) clearly leads to \\(b = 242\\). Therefore, the answer must be:\n\n**Answer: A**",
