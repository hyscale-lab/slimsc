      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me read it carefully and try to understand what's being asked. \n\nThe problem says: 64 boys and 40 girls form a group for social work. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. Now, the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3. The question is, how many members does the group have now? The options are A) 277, B) 288, C) 200, D) 277, E) 168. Wait, wait, options A and D are the same number, 277. That's a bit confusing, but I'll note that.\n\nAlright, so the initial group has 64 boys and 40 girls. Let's denote the number of boys and girls who joined as x each. So, the new number of boys is 64 + x, and the new number of girls is 40 + x. The ratio of boys to girls is now 4:3.\n\nI think I need to set up a proportion here. The ratio (boys)/(girls) should equal 4/3 after the new members join. So, (64 + x)/(40 + x) = 4/3.\n\nHmm, how do I solve this equation for x? Let's cross-multiply to get rid of the fractions. So, 3*(64 + x) = 4*(40 + x). Let's compute both sides.\n\nCalculating the left side: 3*64 is 192, plus 3x. So 192 + 3x.\n\nRight side: 4*40 is 160, plus 4x. So 160 +4x.\n\nSo, the equation becomes 192 + 3x = 160 +4x. Let me rearrange terms to solve for x. I'll subtract 3x from both sides: 192 = 160 + x. Then subtract 160 from both sides: 32 = x.\n\nWait, so x is 32. That means 32 boys and 32 girls joined the group. \n\nNow, let's find the new total number of members. The original total was 64 +40 = 104. Adding 32 boys and 32 girls gives 104 +64 = 168. Wait, 64? Wait, 32+32 is 64, so 104+64=168. So the new total is 168 members. \n\nLooking at the options, option E is 168. So that's the answer. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me go through the steps again. \n\nOriginal boys:64, girls:40.\n\nLet x be the number of boys and girls added. New boys:64+x, new girls:40+x.\n\nRatio is 4:3, so (64+x)/(40+x)=4/3.\n\nCross-multiplying: 3*(64+x) =4*(40+x).\n\n3*64 is 192, 3x. 4*40 is 160, 4x.\n\nSo 192 +3x =160 +4x.\n\nSubtract 3x from both sides: 192=160 +x.\n\nSubtract 160: 32 =x.\n\nSo x=32.\n\nTotal added: 32+32=64.\n\nOriginal total: 64+40=104. Now 104+64=168. Yes, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, looking back, the options are A)277, B)288, C)200, D)277, E)168. So E is 168, which is what I got. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but why are options A and D the same? That must be a typo, but anyway, E is correct.\n",

Let's call the number of boys who joined as x, and since the same number of girls joined, that's also x. So after the drive, the number of boys becomes 64 + x, and the number of girls becomes 40 + x.\n\nThe new ratio of boys to girls is 4:3. So I can set up a proportion here. (64 + x)/(40 + x) = 4/3.

Hmm, both are divisible by 24. 96/24=4, 72/24=3. So yes, 4:3. That checks out.\n\nSo the total members now are 96 boys +72 girls. 96+72=168. Wait, that's one of the options.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, initially, the group has 64 boys and 40 girls. So the initial total is 64 + 40 = 104 people. But that's before the new members joined.\n\nThen, some number of boys and the same number of girls joined. Let's call the number of boys who joined x, so the same x girls joined.

Let me set it up.\n\n(64 + x)/(40 + x) = 4/3\n\nI can cross-multiply to solve for x.\n\n3*(64 + x) = 4*(40 + x)\n\nLet me compute both sides.\n\nLeft side: 3*64 is 192, and 3*x is 3x. So 192 + 3x.\n\nRight side: 4*40 is 160, and 4*x is 4x. So 160 +4x.\n\nSo putting it together:\n\n192 + 3x = 160 +4x\n\nHmm, let's subtract 160 from both sides.\n\n192 -160 +3x = 4x\n\n32 +3x =4x\n\nNow, subtract 3x from both sides:\n\n32 = x\n\nSo x is 32.

Then x boys and x girls added. Ratio becomes (64 +x)/(40 +x) =4/3.\n\nCross-multiplying: 3*(64+x)=4*(40+x)\n\n3*64=192, 4*40=160. So 192 +3x =160 +4x.\n\n192-160=32, so 32= x.\n\nYes, correct.

So E) is 168, which is option E.\n\nBut looking at the options again: options are A)277, B)288, C)200, D)277, E)168. So E is 168, which is what I got. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but why are options A and D both 277? Maybe a typo, but I'll proceed with the correct calculation. So the answer is E)168.\n\n\nInitially, there are 64 boys and 40 girls in the group, making a total of 104 members. During the membership drive, the same number of boys and girls, denoted as \\( x \\), joined the group. After the addition, the number of boys becomes \\( 64 + x \\), and the number of girls becomes \\( 40 + x \\). The new ratio of boys to girls is given as 4:3, leading to the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{64 + x}{40 + x} = \\frac{4}{3}.\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying to eliminate the fraction gives:\n\n\\[\n3(64 + x) = 4(40 + x).\n\\]\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\n\\[\n192 + 3x = 160 + 4x.\n\\]\n\nRearranging terms:\n\n\\[\n192 - 160 = x \\implies x = 32.\n\\]\n\nThus, 32 boys and 32 girls joined the group. The new number of boys is \\( 64 + 32 = 96 \\), and the new number of girls is \\( 40 + 32 = 72 \\). The total number of members is now:\n\n\\[\n96 + 72 = 168.\n\\]\n\nFrom the options provided, the correct answer is:\n\n**A) 277**, **B) 288**, **C) 200**, **D) 277**, **E) 168**.\n\nThe correct answer is **E) 168**.\n\nAnswer: E",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a group of boys and girls and some changes in their numbers. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says there are 64 boys and 40 girls initially. Then, during a membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. Now, the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3. We need to find the total number of members now.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Let's denote the number of boys and girls that joined as x. Since the same number of both joined, x is the same for both. So, the new number of boys would be 64 + x, and the new number of girls would be 40 + x.\n\nThe ratio of boys to girls now is 4:3. So, I can set up a ratio equation. The ratio (64 + x)/(40 + x) should equal 4/3. Let me write that out:\n\n(64 + x)/(40 + x) = 4/3.\n\nNow, I'll solve for x. Cross-multiplying gives 3*(64 + x) = 4*(40 + x). Let me compute that. \n\n3*64 is 192, and 3x is 3x. On the other side, 4*40 is 160, and 4x is 4x. So the equation becomes:\n\n192 + 3x = 160 + 4x.\n\nHmm, let's subtract 3x from both sides to get 192 = 160 + x. Then, subtract 160 from both sides: 192 - 160 is 32, so 32 = x. So x is 32.\n\nThat means 32 boys and 32 girls joined the group. Let me calculate the new totals. Boys: 64 + 32 = 96. Girls: 40 + 32 = 72.\n\nNow, the total number of members is 96 + 72. Let's add those up. 96 +70 is 166, and plus 2 more is 168. So the total is 168.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 168. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\n1. Set x as the number of boys and girls added. Correct.\n2. Ratio equation: (64 + x)/(40 + x) = 4/3. Yes.\n3. Cross-multiplying: 3*(64 +x) =4*(40 +x). Correct.\n4. 192 +3x =160 +4x. Subtract 3x: 192 =160 +x. Subtract 160: x=32. That's right.\n5. Boys now 96, girls 72. Sum is 168. Yes, which is option E. So the answer is E.\n",
