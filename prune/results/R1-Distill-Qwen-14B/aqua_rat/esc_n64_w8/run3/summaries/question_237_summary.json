      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about selecting candy bars from a bag. Let me try to understand it step by step. Hmm, the bag has 11 candy bars in total. They're categorized by their cost: three are 50 cents each, four are $1 each, and four are $2 each. The question is asking how many ways I can select 3 candy bars such that the total cost is more than $4. The options are A to E, with numbers ranging from 8 to 70.\n\nFirst, I think I need to figure out all the possible combinations of the three types of candy bars and calculate the total cost for each combination. Then, I can count how many of those combinations exceed $4.\n\nLet me list out the types again to keep track:\n\n- 50 cents (let's call this type A): 3 available\n- $1 (type B): 4 available\n- $2 (type C): 4 available\n\nI need to choose 3 candy bars. The possible combinations based on types can be:\n\n1. All three are type A.\n2. Two type A and one type B.\n3. Two type A and one type C.\n4. One type A and two type B.\n5. One type A, one type B, and one type C.\n6. One type A and two type C.\n7. Three type B.\n8. Two type B and one type C.\n9. One type B and two type C.\n10. Three type C.\n11. Two type C and one type B (wait, this might be same as option 9, but maybe I should list all possible).\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the number of each type selected, like (a, b, c) where a + b + c =3, and a, b, c are non-negative integers. Then for each possible (a,b,c), I can calculate the total cost and see if it's more than $4.\n\nSo let's list all possible combinations of a, b, c:\n\n1. (3,0,0)\n2. (2,1,0)\n3. (2,0,1)\n4. (1,2,0)\n5. (1,1,1)\n6. (1,0,2)\n7. (0,3,0)\n8. (0,2,1)\n9. (0,1,2)\n10. (0,0,3)\n\nWait, but that's 10 combinations. I think I might have missed some. Let me recount. Oh, wait, the correct way is to find all partitions where a + b + c =3, each being non-negative. So the correct number is 10 combinations.\n\nNow, for each of these, I'll calculate the cost and whether it's over $4.\n\nLet's go through each case.\n\nCase 1: (3,0,0)\nAll three are type A (50 cents each). So cost is 3 * 0.50 = $1.50. That's less than $4. So this case doesn't count.\n\nCase 2: (2,1,0)\nTwo A, one B. Cost: 2*0.50 + 1*1.00 = $1 + $1 = $2. Still less than $4. Not counted.\n\nCase3: (2,0,1)\nTwo A, one C. Cost: 2*0.50 + 1*2.00 = $1 + $2 = $3. Less than $4. Not counted.\n\nCase4: (1,2,0)\nOne A, two B. Cost: 0.50 + 2*1 = $0.50 + $2 = $2.50. Less than $4. No.\n\nCase5: (1,1,1)\nOne each of A, B, C. Cost: 0.50 + 1 + 2 = $3.50. Still under $4. Not counted.\n\nCase6: (1,0,2)\nOne A, two C. Cost: 0.50 + 2*2 = 0.50 +4 = $4.50. That's more than $4. So this counts.\n\nCase7: (0,3,0)\nAll three are B. Cost: 3*1= $3. Under $4. Not counted.\n\nCase8: (0,2,1)\nTwo B, one C. Cost: 2*1 +1*2 = $2 + $2= $4. Exactly $4, which is not more than $4, so this doesn't count.\n\nCase9: (0,1,2)\nOne B, two C. Cost: 1*1 + 2*2 = $1 + $4= $5. More than $4. Counts.\n\nCase10: (0,0,3)\nAll three are C. Cost:3*2= $6. Definitely more than $4. Counts.\n\nWait, but wait a second: the cases I'm evaluating are based on the types selected, but I also need to consider how many ways each case can happen, considering the available quantities.\n\nFor example, for case 6: (1,0,2). So one A, zero B, two C. The number of ways is the product of combinations for each type. So for A: choose 1 from 3, B: choose 0 from 4, C: choose 2 from 4.\n\nSimilarly for each case.\n\nSo I should calculate the number of ways for each case, considering the available quantities, and only sum those where the total cost is more than $4.\n\nSo let's go through each case again, compute the cost, check if it's over $4, and if so, calculate the number of ways.\n\nLet me make a table:\n\nCase | (a,b,c) | Cost | >$4? | Ways\n--- | --- | --- | --- | ---\n1 | (3,0,0) | 1.5 | No | C(3,3)*C(4,0)*C(4,0)=1*1*1=1\n2 | (2,1,0) | 2 | No | C(3,2)*C(4,1)*C(4,0)=3*4*1=12\n3 | (2,0,1) | 3 | No | C(3,2)*C(4,0)*C(4,1)=3*1*4=12\n4 | (1,2,0) | 2.5 | No | C(3,1)*C(4,2)*C(4,0)=3*6*1=18\n5 | (1,1,1) | 3.5 | No | C(3,1)*C(4,1)*C(4,1)=3*4*4=48\n6 | (1,0,2) |4.5 | Yes | C(3,1)*C(4,0)*C(4,2)=3*1*6=18\n7 | (0,3,0) |3 | No | C(3,0)*C(4,3)*C(4,0)=1*4*1=4\n8 | (0,2,1) |4 | No | C(3,0)*C(4,2)*C(4,1)=1*6*4=24\n9 | (0,1,2) |5 | Yes | C(3,0)*C(4,1)*C(4,2)=1*4*6=24\n10 | (0,0,3) |6 | Yes | C(3,0)*C(4,0)*C(4,3)=1*1*4=4\n\nNow, let's sum the ways where the cost is >$4.\n\nLooking at the table, cases 6,9,10 have cost over $4.\n\nSo:\n\nCase6: 18 ways\n\nCase9:24 ways\n\nCase10:4 ways\n\nAdding these up: 18 +24=42, plus 4 makes 46.\n\nSo the total number of ways is 46.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 46. So the correct answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if I didn't miss any other cases.\n\nWait, case6: (1,0,2) is one A, two C. Cost 4.50, which is >4.\n\nCase9: (0,1,2): one B, two C: $5.\n\nCase10: (0,0,3): three C: $6.\n\nWait, but what about case (0,2,2)? No, because a+b+c must be 3. Wait, no, because (0,2,2) sums to 4. So that's not a valid case here.\n\nWait, another thought: Did I miss any cases where the cost is over $4?\n\nWait, let's think about the possible combinations. For three candy bars, the maximum possible cost is 3*$2 = $6, which is case10.\n\nWhat about combinations that have two C's and one B: (0,1,2). That's case9, which I included.\n\nWhat about (0,2,1): that's case8, which is exactly $4, so it's not counted.\n\nAnother possible case: (0,0,3) is case10, which is included.\n\nWait, another possibility: (0,3,0) is case7, which is $3, not included.\n\nSo I think I've accounted for all cases where the cost exceeds $4.\n\nSo the sum is 18 +24 +4=46.\n\nLooking back at the options, C is 46. So the answer should be C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about selecting candy bars from a bag, and I need to figure out how many ways I can pick 3 such that their total cost is more than $4. Hmm, let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the setup. There are 11 candy bars in total. They're divided into three groups based on their cost:\n- 3 candy bars cost 50 cents each (so $0.50)\n- 4 cost $1 each\n- 4 cost $2 each\n\nI need to choose 3 of them, and their total cost should be more than $4. The options are A to E, with E being 70, which I think is the total number of possible ways to choose 3 candy bars from 11, right? Because 11 choose 3 is 165, wait, no, wait. Wait, 11 choose 3 is (11*10*9)/(3*2*1) = 165. Oh, but the options don't go that high. So maybe the options are given as possible answers, but I have to calculate the correct one.\n\nWait, the options are A)8, B)28, C)46, D)66, E)70. Hmm, so E is 70, which is less than 165. So I must be misunderstanding something. Wait, no, wait, the total number of ways to choose 3 from 11 is 165, but the options given don't go that high. So perhaps the question is asking for something else. Wait, no, the question is about the number of ways where the total cost is more than $4. So I have to compute that.\n\nLet me think about the possible combinations of candy bars. Since there are three types, the possible ways to pick 3 can vary. Let's list all possible combinations of the types and their costs.\n\nEach candy bar can be 0.5, 1, or 2 dollars. So when I pick three, their costs can add up in different ways. The goal is to find all triplets where the sum is more than 4 dollars.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to calculate the total number of ways to pick 3, subtract the number of ways where the sum is less than or equal to 4.\n\nWait, that might be a better approach because sometimes it's easier to find the complement.\n\nSo total ways: 11 choose 3. Let me calculate that. 11*10*9/(3*2*1) = 165. So total possible selections are 165.\n\nNow, I need to find how many of these selections have a total cost <=4. Then subtract that from 165 to get the answer.\n\nSo let's compute the number of selections where the total cost is <=4.\n\nWhat are the possible combinations of 3 candy bars that sum to 4 or less?\n\nLet's think about the possible triplet types:\n\n1. All three are 0.5$ bars. Let's see: 3 * 0.5 = 1.5, which is way less than 4. So this is definitely part of the <=4 case.\n\nBut wait, are there 3 bars in the 0.5 group? Yes, the problem states three. So the number of ways to choose all three from the 0.5 group is C(3,3) = 1.\n\n2. Two 0.5 bars and one 1$ bar: 2*0.5 + 1 = 1 +1=2$ <=4.\n\nHow many ways? C(3,2) * C(4,1) = 3 *4=12.\n\n3. Two 0.5 bars and one 2$ bar: 2*0.5 +2=1+2=3$ <=4.\n\nNumber of ways: 3 choose 2 *4 choose 1 = 3*4=12.\n\n4. One 0.5 bar, two 1$ bars: 0.5 +2*1=2.5 <=4.\n\nNumber of ways: 3C1 *4C2=3*(6)=18.\n\n5. One 0.5 bar, one 1$, and one 2$: 0.5+1+2=3.5 <=4.\n\nNumber of ways: 3*4*4=48.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me make sure. Because it's one of each type, so 3 ways for the 0.5, 4 for 1$, and 4 for 2$, so 3*4*4=48.\n\n6. Three 1$ bars: 3*1=3 <=4.\n\nNumber of ways: 4C3=4.\n\n7. Two 1$ and one 2$: 2+2=4. Exactly 4, which is <=4.\n\nSo number of ways: 4C2 *4C1=6 *4=24.\n\n8. One 1$ and two 2$ bars: 1+4=5, which is more than 4. So this case is not included in the <=4. So we don't count it.\n\nWait, but wait, let's see. Are there any other combinations where the sum is <=4?\n\nLet me think:\n\n- All three 2$ bars: 6$, which is way more than 4.\n\n- Two 2$ and one 1$: 5$, which is more than 4.\n\n- One 2$, two 1$: sum is 4, which is included.\n\nWait, but in case 7, two 1$ and one 2$ gives exactly 4, so it's included in the <=4.\n\nSo let's list all the cases where the sum is <=4:\n\nCase 1: 3 *0.5 \u2192 sum=1.5 \u2192 count 1.\n\nCase 2: 2*0.5 +1 \u2192 sum=2 \u2192 count 12.\n\nCase 3: 2*0.5 +2 \u2192 sum=3 \u2192 count 12.\n\nCase 4: 1*0.5 +2*1 \u2192 sum=2.5 \u2192 count 18.\n\nCase 5: 1*0.5 +1 +2 \u2192 sum=3.5 \u2192 count 48.\n\nCase 6: 3*1 \u2192 sum=3 \u2192 count 4.\n\nCase 7: 2*1 +1*2 \u2192 sum=4 \u2192 count 24.\n\nAre there any other cases?\n\nWhat about 1*0.5, 1*1, and 1*2: that's case 5.\n\nWhat about 3*1 and 0.5? No, that's already covered.\n\nWait, what about 1*0.5, and two 2$? That would be 0.5 +4=4.5>4, so not included.\n\nAnother possibility: 3*2$? No, 6>4.\n\nSo all the cases where sum <=4 are the ones I've listed.\n\nNow, let's sum all these counts:\n\nCase 1: 1\n\nCase 2: 12 \u2192 total 13\n\nCase 3:12 \u2192 25\n\nCase4:18 \u219243\n\nCase5:48 \u219291\n\nCase6:4 \u219295\n\nCase7:24 \u2192119.\n\nSo total number of triplets where sum <=4 is 119.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me add them again:\n\n1 +12=13,\n\n13+12=25,\n\n25+18=43,\n\n43+48=91,\n\n91+4=95,\n\n95+24=119.\n\nYes, total 119.\n\nSo the total number of triplets where sum >4 is total triplets (165) minus 119.\n\n165 -119 =46.\n\nSo the answer should be 46, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the counts.\n\nLet me recount each case.\n\nCase1: all 0.5. 3C3=1. Correct.\n\nCase2: two 0.5, one 1. 3C2=3, 4C1=4. 3*4=12. Correct.\n\nCase3: two 0.5, one 2. 3C2=3, 4C1=4 \u219212. Correct.\n\nCase4: one 0.5, two 1s. 3C1=3, 4C2=6 \u2192 18. Correct.\n\nCase5: one 0.5, one 1, one 2. 3*4*4=48. Correct.\n\nCase6: three 1s. 4C3=4. Correct.\n\nCase7: two 1s, one 2. 4C2=6, 4C1=4 \u21926*4=24. Correct.\n\nSo yes, adding up to 119.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Are there any other cases where the sum is <=4?\n\nWhat about three 2s? No, because that's 6, which is more than 4. So not included.\n\nWhat about one 0.5, one 2, and one 1? That's case5, which is 3.5. Correct.\n\nWait, another possibility: one 0.5, two 2s. 0.5 +2+2=4.5>4. So not included.\n\nSo no, that's not part of the <=4 cases. So I think the 119 is correct.\n\nSo 165 -119=46. So the answer is 46, which is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about selecting candy bars from a bag, and I need to figure out how many ways I can pick 3 such that their total cost is more than $4. Hmm, let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the setup. There are 11 candy bars in total. They're divided into three groups based on their cost:\n- 3 candy bars cost 50 cents each (so $0.50)\n- 4 cost $1 each\n- 4 cost $2 each\n\nI need to choose 3 of them, and their total cost should be more than $4. The options are A to E, with E being 70, which I think is the total number of possible ways to choose 3 candy bars from 11, right? Because 11 choose 3 is 165, wait, no, wait. Wait, 11 choose 3 is (11*10*9)/(3*2*1) = 165. Oh, but the options don't go that high. So maybe the options are given as possible answers, but I have to calculate the correct one.\n\nWait, the options are A)8, B)28, C)46, D)66, E)70. Hmm, so E is 70, which is less than 165. So I must be misunderstanding something. Wait, no, wait, the total number of ways to choose 3 from 11 is 165, but the options given don't go that high. So perhaps the question is asking for something else. Wait, no, the question is about the number of ways where the total cost is more than $4. So I have to compute that.\n\nLet me think about the possible combinations of candy bars. Since there are three types, the possible ways to pick 3 can vary. Let's list all possible combinations of the types and their costs.\n\nEach candy bar can be 0.5, 1, or 2 dollars. So when I pick three, their costs can add up in different ways. The goal is to find all triplets where the sum is more than 4 dollars.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to calculate the total number of ways to pick 3, subtract the number of ways where the sum is less than or equal to 4.\n\nWait, that might be a better approach because sometimes it's easier to find the complement.\n\nSo total ways: 11 choose 3. Let me calculate that. 11*10*9/(3*2*1) = 165. So total possible selections are 165.\n\nNow, I need to find how many of these selections have a total cost <=4. Then subtract that from 165 to get the answer.\n\nSo let's compute the number of selections where the total cost is <=4.\n\nWhat are the possible combinations of 3 candy bars that sum to 4 or less?\n\nLet's think about the possible triplet types:\n\n1. All three are 0.5$ bars. Let's see: 3 * 0.5 = 1.5, which is way less than 4. So this is definitely part of the <=4 case.\n\nBut wait, are there 3 bars in the 0.5 group? Yes, the problem states three. So the number of ways to choose all three from the 0.5 group is C(3,3) = 1.\n\n2. Two 0.5 bars and one 1$ bar: 2*0.5 + 1 = 1 +1=2$ <=4.\n\nHow many ways? C(3,2) * C(4,1) = 3 *4=12.\n\n3. Two 0.5 bars and one 2$ bar: 2*0.5 +2=1+2=3$ <=4.\n\nNumber of ways: 3 choose 2 *4 choose 1 = 3*4=12.\n\n4. One 0.5 bar, two 1$ bars: 0.5 +2*1=2.5 <=4.\n\nNumber of ways: 3C1 *4C2=3*(6)=18.\n\n5. One 0.5 bar, one 1$, and one 2$: 0.5+1+2=3.5 <=4.\n\nNumber of ways: 3*4*4=48.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me make sure. Because it's one of each type, so 3 ways for the 0.5, 4 for 1$, and 4 for 2$, so 3*4*4=48.\n\n6. Three 1$ bars: 3*1=3 <=4.\n\nNumber of ways: 4C3=4.\n\n7. Two 1$ and one 2$: 2+2=4. Exactly 4, which is <=4.\n\nSo number of ways: 4C2 *4C1=6 *4=24.\n\n8. One 1$ and two 2$ bars: 1+4=5, which is more than 4. So this case is not included in the <=4. So we don't count it.\n\nWait, but wait, let's see.

That's case5, which is 3.5. Correct.\n\nWait, another possibility: one 0.5, two 2s. 0.5 +2+2=4.5>4. So not included.\n\nSo no, that's not part of the <=4 cases.

Hmm, let me break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, the bag has 11 candy bars in total. They're categorized by their cost: three are 50 cents each, four are $1 each, and four are $2 each. So, the types are 50c, $1, and $2, with quantities 3,4,4 respectively.\n\nThe question is asking for the number of ways to select 3 candy bars where the total cost exceeds $4. So, I need to calculate all possible combinations of 3 candy bars and then determine which of those combinations sum to more than $4.\n\nFirst, maybe it's easier to calculate the total number of ways to choose any 3 candy bars and then subtract the number of combinations that don't meet the cost condition. Alternatively, I can directly calculate the valid combinations. I'm not sure which is easier yet.\n\nLet me think about the total number of ways to choose 3 from 11. That's a combination problem, so 11 choose 3. The formula is 11!/(3!*(11-3)!) = (11*10*9)/(3*2*1) = 165. So there are 165 possible ways in total.\n\nBut I need the number of ways where the sum is more than $4. So maybe it's easier to find all the possible combinations that add up to $4 or less, and then subtract that from the total.\n\nWait, but the cost is in dollars. Let me convert everything to cents to avoid confusion. $4 is 400 cents. So the total cost needs to be more than 400 cents.\n\nThe candy bars are priced as:\n- 3 at 50c each (0.50 $)\n- 4 at 100c each (1.00 $)\n- 4 at 200c each (2.00 $)\n\nSo, the problem is to select 3 candy bars where the sum is >400c.\n\nLet me list all possible combinations of 3 candy bars and calculate their total costs.\n\nPossible combinations are based on how many of each type are selected. The types are 50c (let's call them A), 100c (B), and 200c (C).\n\nPossible cases when selecting 3 candy bars:\n\nCase 1: All three are C (200c each)\nSum: 200 * 3 = 600c, which is way more than 400c. So this case is valid.\n\nCase 2: Two C and one B\nSum: 200*2 +100 =500c >400. Valid.\n\nCase3: Two C and one A\nSum: 200*2 +50=450c >400. Valid.\n\nCase4: One C and two B\nSum:200 + 100*2=400c. Hmm, exactly 400. So not more than, so this is invalid.\n\nCase5: One C, one B, one A\nSum:200+100+50=350c <400. Invalid.\n\nCase6: One C and two A\nSum:200 +50*2=300c <400. Invalid.\n\nCase7: Three B\nSum:100*3=300c <400. Invalid.\n\nCase8: Two B and one A\nSum:100*2 +50=250c <400. Invalid.\n\nCase9: One B and two A\nSum:100 +50*2=200c <400. Invalid.\n\nCase10: Three A\nSum:50*3=150c <400. Invalid.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some cases. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to list all possible combinations systematically, considering the number of each type selected. So, the possible numbers of A, B, C in the selection:\n\nWe need a + b + c =3, where a is the number of A's (0,1,2,3), b is the number of B's, and c is the number of C's. But a can't be more than 3, b not more than 4, c not more than 4.\n\nBut since we're choosing 3, each of a, b, c can be 0 to 3, but with a + b + c =3.\n\nLet me go through all possible triples (a,b,c) where a + b + c =3 and a<=3, b<=4, c<=4.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to compute the sum for each possible combination and see if it's >400c.\n\nWait, but I can structure this by considering the maximum number of high-cost items. For example, let's think about how many C's (200c each) are in the selection.\n\nEach C is 200c, so the more C's, the higher the sum.\n\nSo:\n\n- 3 C's: sum is 600c. Valid.\n- 2 C's: sum is 400 + the third item's cost. The third can be A (50) or B (100). So 2 C's + A: 450c. 2 C's + B: 500c. Both valid.\n- 1 C: sum is 200 + sum of two others. The two others can be:\n   - both B: 200 + 200 =400. Not more than 400. Invalid.\n   - one B and one A: 200 +150=350 <400. Invalid.\n   - two A: 200 +100=300 <400. Invalid.\nSo any selection with only 1 C is invalid.\n\nWhat about 0 C's? Then the sum is from B's and A's. Maximum sum is 3 B's: 300c, which is less than 400. So 0 C's can't reach 400.\n\nSo the only valid cases are when there are 2 or 3 C's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If I have 2 C's and 1 B, sum is 500c. If I have 2 C's and 1 A, sum is 450c, which is still more than 400.\n\nWait, but what about 1 C, 1 B, and 1 A? That's 350c, which is less than 400.\n\nSo the only valid cases are when the number of C's is 2 or 3.\n\nSo now, let's calculate the number of ways for each valid case.\n\nCase 1: 3 C's.\n\nNumber of ways: We have 4 C's in the bag. So how many ways to choose 3? It's 4 choose 3 =4.\n\nCase 2: 2 C's and 1 other.\n\nThe other can be either a B or an A. So let's compute for each possibility.\n\nSubcase 2a: 2 C's and 1 B.\n\nNumber of ways: (4 C choose 2) * (4 B choose 1). So that's (6) *4=24.\n\nSubcase 2b: 2 C's and 1 A.\n\nNumber of ways: (4 C choose 2) * (3 A choose 1)=6 *3=18.\n\nSo total for case 2: 24 +18=42.\n\nSo total valid cases: case1 (3C) + case2 (2C+1B and 2C+1A) =4 +42=46.\n\nWait, but I thought the total number of ways is 165, so 46 is the answer. Let me check the options. Option C is 46.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other valid combinations. Are there any other possibilities where the sum exceeds 400c? Like, perhaps with more B's or a combination of B's and C's?\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose I have 1 C and 2 B's: sum is 200 + 200 =400c, which is exactly 400. The problem says more than $4, so 400c is $4, so it's not included. So that's invalid.\n\nWhat about 1 C, 1 B, and 1 A? 200+100+50=350c, which is less than 400.\n\nSo, the only valid combinations are those with 3 C's or 2 C's and one other (B or A). So the calculation seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to approach this is to calculate all possible combinations and then subtract those that are 400c or less.\n\nLet me compute the total number of ways to choose 3 candy bars: 11C3=165.\n\nNow, the number of invalid combinations (sum <=400c) would be 165 - valid = invalid. So if I compute invalid and subtract from 165, I get the valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute invalid, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the invalid cases to cross-check.\n\nInvalid cases are those where the sum is 400c or less.\n\nSo, what are the possible combinations where sum <=400c?\n\nThese include:\n\n- All possible selections except the ones with 2 or 3 C's.\n\nWait, no. Because, for example, 2 C's and 1 B is 500c, which is valid. So the invalid combinations are those that don't have 2 or 3 C's, and also some that might have 1 C but sum <=400.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all possible combinations and see.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of the invalid cases as those that either have 0,1, or 2 C's but their sum is <=400c.\n\nWait, but if you have 2 C's, the sum is at least 400c, so any selection with 2 C's is valid.\n\nWait no, 2 C's would be 400c plus whatever the third is. So 2 C's and 1 A is 450c (valid), 2 C's and 1 B is 500c (valid). So any selection with 2 or 3 C's is valid.\n\nSo invalid combinations are those with 0 or 1 C's, and sum <=400c.\n\nBut wait, some combinations with 1 C may have sum <=400c. For example, 1 C, 1 B, 1 A: 350c, which is invalid. So these are included in the invalid count.\n\nSo let's compute the number of invalid combinations:\n\nInvalid cases are:\n\nAll combinations where a + b + c =3, and sum <=400c.\n\nWhich includes:\n\n- All cases with 0 C's.\n\n- All cases with 1 C, where the sum is <=400c.\n\nSo, let's compute each.\n\nCase A: 0 C's.\n\nSo selecting 3 from A and B. So possible combinations:\n\na + b =3, a can be 0-3, b can be 0-3 (since 4 B's available, but we're choosing 3).\n\nPossible (a,b):\n\n(3,0), (2,1), (1,2), (0,3).\n\nCompute the sum for each:\n\n(3,0): 3*50 +0=150c.\n\n(2,1): 2*50 +1*100=200c.\n\n(1,2): 50 +2*100=250c.\n\n(0,3): 0 +3*100=300c.\n\nAll of these are <=400c, so all are invalid.\n\nNow, the number of ways for each:\n\n(3,0): choose 3 A's from 3 available. 3C3=1.\n\n(2,1): 3C2 *4C1=3 *4=12.\n\n(1,2): 3C1 *4C2=3 *6=18.\n\n(0,3): 4C3=4.\n\nSo total for 0 C's: 1+12+18+4=35.\n\nCase B: 1 C, and sum <=400c.\n\nSo c=1, and a + b =2.\n\nPossible (a,b):\n\n(2,0), (1,1), (0,2).\n\nCompute sum for each:\n\n(2,0): 2*50 +0=100c. 200 (C) +100=300 <=400. So valid.\n\nWait, no, the sum is 200 + 100 =300? Wait, no, wait. Wait, a is the number of A's, which are 50c each. So when c=1 (200c), and a=2, b=0: sum is 200 + 2*50=300c.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n(1,1): 200 +1*50 +1*100=350c.\n\n(0,2): 200 + 0 +2*100=400c.\n\nSo all these cases sum to <=400c, so they are invalid.\n\nNow, number of ways for each:\n\n(2,0): 4C1 (for C) *3C2 (A) *4C0 (B)=4 *3 *1=12.\n\n(1,1): 4C1 *3C1 *4C1=4 *3 *4=48.\n\n(0,2):4C1 *3C0 *4C2=4 *1 *6=24.\n\nSo total for 1 C and sum <=400c: 12+48+24=84.\n\nWait, but wait: when c=1, a + b =2. So the possible (a,b) are (2,0), (1,1), (0,2).\n\nSo, for each:\n\n(2,0): a=2, b=0. So number of ways is (4C1) * (3C2) * (4C0) =4 *3 *1=12.\n\n(1,1): (4C1) * (3C1) * (4C1) =4*3*4=48.\n\n(0,2): (4C1) * (3C0) * (4C2) =4 *1 *6=24.\n\nSo total 12+48+24=84.\n\nWait, but wait, 4C0 is 1, so that's correct.\n\nSo total invalid cases are case A (0 C's:35) plus case B (1 C and sum<=400:84) \u2192 35+84=119.\n\nBut wait, wait a minute. The total number of possible 3-candy selections is 165. If invalid is 119, then valid is 165-119=46. Which matches the previous calculation.\n\nSo the answer is 46, which is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about selecting candy bars from a bag, and I need to figure out how many ways I can choose 3 candy bars such that the total cost is more than $4. Hmm, let me break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, the bag has 11 candy bars in total. They're categorized by their cost: three are 50 cents each, four are $1 each, and four are $2 each. So, the types are 50c, $1, and $2, with quantities 3,4,4 respectively.\n\nThe question is asking for the number of ways to select 3 candy bars where the total cost exceeds $4. So, I need to calculate all possible combinations of 3 candy bars and then determine which of those combinations sum to more than $4.\n\nFirst, maybe it's easier to calculate the total number of ways to choose any 3 candy bars and then subtract the number of combinations that don't meet the cost condition. Alternatively, I can directly calculate the valid combinations. I'm not sure which is easier yet.\n\nLet me think about the total number of ways to choose 3 from 11. That's a combination problem, so 11 choose 3. The formula is 11!/(3!*(11-3)!) = (11*10*9)/(3*2*1) = 165. So there are 165 possible ways in total.\n\nBut I need the number of ways where the sum is more than $4. So maybe it's easier to find all the possible combinations that add up to $4 or less, and then subtract that from the total.\n\nWait, but the cost is in dollars. Let me convert everything to cents to avoid confusion. $4 is 400 cents. So the total cost needs to be more than 400 cents.\n\nThe candy bars are priced as:\n- 3 at 50c each (0.50 $)\n- 4 at 100c each (1.00 $)\n- 4 at 200c each (2.00 $)\n\nSo, the problem is to select 3 candy bars where the sum is >400c.\n\nLet me list all possible combinations of 3 candy bars and calculate their total costs.\n\nPossible combinations are based on how many of each type are selected. The types are 50c (let's call them A), 100c (B), and 200c (C).\n\nPossible cases when selecting 3 candy bars:\n\nCase 1: All three are C (200c each)\nSum: 200 * 3 = 600c, which is way more than 400c. So this case is valid.\n\nCase 2: Two C and one B\nSum: 200*2 +100 =500c >400. Valid.\n\nCase3: Two C and one A\nSum: 200*2 +50=450c >400. Valid.\n\nCase4: One C and two B\nSum:200 + 100*2=400c. Hmm, exactly 400. So not more than, so this is invalid.\n\nCase5: One C, one B, one A\nSum:200+100+50=350c <400. Invalid.\n\nCase6: One C and two A\nSum:200 +50*2=300c <400. Invalid.\n\nCase7: Three B\nSum:100*3=300c <400. Invalid.\n\nCase8: Two B and one A\nSum:100*2 +50=250c <400. Invalid.\n\nCase9: One B and two A\nSum:100 +50*2=200c <400. Invalid.\n\nCase10: Three A\nSum:50*3=150c <400. Invalid.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some cases. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to list all possible combinations systematically, considering the number of each type selected. So, the possible numbers of A, B, C in the selection:\n\nWe need a + b + c =3, where a is the number of A's (0,1,2,3), b is the number of B's, and c is the number of C's. But a can't be more than 3, b not more than 4, c not more than 4.\n\nBut since we're choosing 3, each of a, b, c can be 0 to 3, but with a + b + c =3.\n\nLet me go through all possible triples (a,b,c) where a + b + c =3 and a<=3, b<=4, c<=4.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to compute the sum for each possible combination and see if it's >400c.\n\nWait, but I can structure this by considering the maximum number of high-cost items. For example, let's think about how many C's (200c each) are in the selection.\n\nEach C is 200c, so the more C's, the higher the sum.\n\nSo:\n\n- 3 C's: sum is 600c. Valid.\n- 2 C's: sum is 400 + the third item's cost. The third can be A (50) or B (100). So 2 C's + A: 450c. 2 C's + B: 500c. Both valid.\n- 1 C: sum is 200 + sum of two others. The two others can be:\n   - both B: 200 + 200 =400. Not more than 400. Invalid.\n   - one B and one A: 200 +150=350 <400. Invalid.\n   - two A: 200 +100=300 <400. Invalid.\nSo any selection with only 1 C is invalid.\n\nWhat about 0 C's? Then the sum is from B's and A's. Maximum sum is 3 B's: 300c, which is less than 400. So 0 C's can't reach 400.\n\nSo the only valid cases are when there are 2 or 3 C's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If I have 2 C's and 1 B, sum is 500c. If I have 2 C's and 1 A, sum is 450c, which is still more than 400.\n\nWait, but what about 1 C, 1 B, and 1 A? That's 350c, which is less than 400.\n\nSo the only valid cases are when the number of C's is 2 or 3.\n\nSo now, let's calculate the number of ways for each valid case.\n\nCase 1: 3 C's.\n\nNumber of ways: We have 4 C's in the bag. So how many ways to choose 3? It's 4 choose 3 =4.\n\nCase 2: 2 C's and 1 other.\n\nThe other can be either a B or an A. So let's compute for each possibility.\n\nSubcase 2a: 2 C's and 1 B.\n\nNumber of ways: (4 C choose 2) * (4 B choose 1). So that's (6) *4=24.\n\nSubcase 2b: 2 C's and 1 A.\n\nNumber of ways: (4 C choose 2) * (3 A choose 1)=6 *3=18.\n\nSo total for case 2: 24 +18=42.\n\nSo total valid cases: case1 (3C) + case2 (2C+1B and 2C+1A) =4 +42=46.\n\nWait, but I thought the total number of ways is 165, so 46 is the answer. Let me check the options. Option C is 46.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other valid combinations. Are there any other possibilities where the sum exceeds 400c? Like, perhaps with more B's or a combination of B's and C's?\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose I have 1 C and 2 B's: sum is 200 + 200 =400c, which is exactly 400. The problem says more than $4, so 400c is $4, so it's not included. So that's invalid.\n\nWhat about 1 C, 1 B, and 1 A? 200+100+50=350c, which is less than 400.\n\nSo, the only valid combinations are those with 3 C's or 2 C's and one other (B or A). So the calculation seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to approach this is to calculate all possible combinations and then subtract those that are 400c or less.\n\nLet me compute the total number of ways to choose 3 candy bars: 11C3=165.\n\nNow, the number of invalid combinations (sum <=400c) would be 165 - valid = invalid. So if I compute invalid and subtract from 165, I get the valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute invalid, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the invalid cases to cross-check.\n\nInvalid cases are those where the sum is 400c or less.\n\nSo, what are the possible combinations where sum <=400c?\n\nThese include:\n\n- All possible selections except the ones with 2 or 3 C's.\n\nWait, no. Because, for example, 2 C's and 1 B is 500c, which is valid. So the invalid combinations are those that don't have 2 or 3 C's, and also some that might have 1 C but sum <=400.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all possible combinations and see.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of the invalid cases as those that either have 0,1, or 2 C's but their sum is <=400c.\n\nWait, but if you have 2 C's, the sum is at least 400c, so any selection with 2 C's is valid.\n\nWait no, 2 C's would be 400c plus whatever the third is. So 2 C's and 1 A is 450c (valid), 2 C's and 1 B is 500c (valid). So any selection with 2 or 3 C's is valid.\n\nSo invalid combinations are those with 0 or 1 C's, and sum <=400c.\n\nBut wait, some combinations with 1 C may have sum <=400c. For example, 1 C, 1 B, 1 A: 350c, which is invalid. So these are included in the invalid count.\n\nSo let's compute the number of invalid combinations:\n\nInvalid cases are:\n\nAll combinations where a + b + c =3, and sum <=400c.\n\nWhich includes:\n\n- All cases with 0 C's.\n\n- All cases with 1 C, where the sum is <=400c.\n\nSo, let's compute each.\n\nCase A: 0 C's.\n\nSo selecting 3 from A and B. So possible combinations:\n\na + b =3, a can be 0-3, b can be 0-3 (since 4 B's available, but we're choosing 3).\n\nPossible (a,b):\n\n(3,0), (2,1), (1,2), (0,3).\n\nCompute the sum for each:\n\n(3,0): 3*50 +0=150c.\n\n(2,1): 2*50 +1*100=200c.\n\n(1,2): 50 +2*100=250c.\n\n(0,3): 0 +3*100=300c.\n\nAll of these are <=400c, so all are invalid.\n\nNow, the number of ways for each:\n\n(3,0): choose 3 A's from 3 available. 3C3=1.\n\n(2,1): 3C2 *4C1=3 *4=12.\n\n(1,2): 3C1 *4C2=3 *6=18.\n\n(0,3): 4C3=4.\n\nSo total for 0 C's: 1+12+18+4=35.\n\nCase B: 1 C, and sum <=400c.\n\nSo c=1, and a + b =2.\n\nPossible (a,b):\n\n(2,0), (1,1), (0,2).\n\nCompute sum for each:\n\n(2,0): 2*50 +0=100c. 200 (C) +100=300 <=400. So valid.\n\nWait, no, the sum is 200 + 100 =300? Wait, no, wait. Wait, a is the number of A's, which are 50c each. So when c=1 (200c), and a=2, b=0: sum is 200 + 2*50=300c.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n(1,1): 200 +1*50 +1*100=350c.\n\n(0,2): 200 + 0 +2*100=400c.\n\nSo all these cases sum to <=400c, so they are invalid.\n\nNow, number of ways for each:\n\n(2,0): 4C1 (for C) *3C2 (A) *4C0 (B)=4 *3 *1=12.\n\n(1,1): 4C1 *3C1 *4C1=4 *3 *4=48.\n\n(0,2):4C1 *3C0 *4C2=4 *1 *6=24.\n\nSo total for 1 C and sum <=400c: 12+48+24=84.\n\nWait, but wait: when c=1, a + b =2. So the possible (a,b) are (2,0), (1,1), (0,2).\n\nSo, for each:\n\n(2,0): a=2, b=0.

The total number of possible 3-candy selections is 165. If invalid is 119, then valid is 165-119=46. Which matches the previous calculation.\n\nSo the answer is 46, which is option C.\n\n\nTo determine the number of ways to select 3 candy bars from the bag such that the total cost exceeds $4 (400 cents), we analyze the possible combinations of candy bars based on their costs:\n\n- **Candy bar types**:\n  - 3 candy bars cost 50 cents each (A).\n  - 4 candy bars cost 100 cents each (B).\n  - 4 candy bars cost 200 cents each (C).\n\nThe total number of ways to select 3 candy bars from 11 is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{11}{3} = \\frac{11!}{3!(11-3)!} = 165.\n\\]\n\nWe need to identify the valid combinations where the total cost exceeds 400 cents. The valid combinations are those with 2 or 3 candy bars of type C (200 cents each), as these are the only combinations that can exceed 400 cents.\n\n### Valid Cases:\n1. **3 candy bars of type C**:\n   - Total cost: \\(3 \\times 200 = 600\\) cents.\n   - Number of ways: \\(\\binom{4}{3} = 4\\).\n\n2. **2 candy bars of type C and 1 candy bar of type B**:\n   - Total cost: \\(2 \\times 200 + 1 \\times 100 = 500\\) cents.\n   - Number of ways: \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{4}{1} = 6 \\times 4 = 24\\).\n\n3. **2 candy bars of type C and 1 candy bar of type A**:\n   - Total cost: \\(2 \\times 200 + 1 \\times 50 = 450\\) cents.\n   - Number of ways: \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{3}{1} = 6 \\times 3 = 18\\).\n\nAdding these, the total number of valid combinations is:\n\n\\[\n4 + 24 + 18 = 46.\n\\]\n\n### Verification:\nTo verify, we calculate the total number of invalid combinations (where the total cost is 400 cents or less) and subtract from the total combinations:\n\n1. **Invalid combinations with 0 candy bars of type C**:\n   - Possible selections: 3 A\u2019s, 2 A\u2019s + 1 B, 1 A + 2 B\u2019s, or 3 B\u2019s.\n   - Number of ways: \\(\\binom{3}{3} + \\binom{3}{2} \\times \\binom{4}{1} + \\binom{3}{1} \\times \\binom{4}{2} + \\binom{4}{3} = 1 + 12 + 18 + 4 = 35\\).\n\n2. **Invalid combinations with 1 candy bar of type C**:\n   - Possible selections: 2 A\u2019s + 1 C, 1 A + 1 B + 1 C, or 2 B\u2019s + 1 C.\n   - Number of ways: \\(\\binom{3}{2} \\times \\binom{4}{1} + \\binom{3}{1} \\times \\binom{4}{1} \\times \\binom{4}{1} + \\binom{3}{0} \\times \\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{4}{1} = 12 + 48 + 24 = 84\\).\n\nTotal invalid combinations: \\(35 + 84 = 119\\).\n\nThus, the total valid combinations are:\n\n\\[\n165 - 119 = 46.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe number of ways to select 3 candy bars such that the total cost exceeds $4 is **46**.\n\nAnswer: C",

I'm a bit rusty on combinatorics, but I'll do my best.\n\nFirst, the setup: There are 11 candy bars in total. They're divided into three groups based on their prices. Let me list them out:\n\n- 3 candy bars cost 50 cents each. So those are $0.50 each.\n- 4 candy bars cost $1 each.\n- 4 candy bars cost $2 each.\n\nAnd the question is asking how many ways can we select 3 candy bars such that their total cost is more than $4. The options are A)8, B)28, C)46, D)66, E)70.\n\nHmm, okay. So, the total number of possible ways to select 3 candy bars from 11 is a combination problem. The formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n!/(k!(n-k)!). So 11 choose 3 would be 165. But that's the total without any restrictions. We need to find how many of those combinations have a total cost over $4.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to calculate the total number of possible combinations (which is 165) and subtract the number of combinations where the total cost is $4 or less. That might be simpler because sometimes it's easier to calculate the complement.\n\nSo, the plan is: total combinations (165) minus the number of combinations where the total cost is \u2264$4. The result will be the number of combinations where the total is >$4.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible combinations of candy bars that sum to $4 or less.\n\nEach candy bar can be either 0.5, 1, or 2 dollars. Since we're choosing 3, let's consider all possible combinations of these three types and calculate their total costs.\n\nThe types are:\n\nType A: 0.5$ (3 available)\nType B: 1$ (4 available)\nType C: 2$ (4 available)\n\nWe need to pick 3 candy bars, so let's consider the possible distributions of types.\n\nThe possible distributions when selecting 3 are:\n\n1. All three are Type A: 0.5*3 = 1.5$.\n2. Two Type A, one Type B: 0.5*2 + 1 = 1.0 + 1 = 1.5$.\n3. Two Type A, one Type C: 0.5*2 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3$.\n4. One Type A, two Type B: 0.5 + 2 = 2.5$.\n5. One Type A, one Type B, one Type C: 0.5 +1 +2=3.5$.\n6. One Type A, two Type C: 0.5 + 4=4.5$.\n7. Three Type B: 3$.\n8. Two Type B, one Type C: 2 + 2=4$.\n9. One Type B, two Type C: 1 +4=5$.\n10. All three Type C: 6$.\n\nWait, but wait. We're looking for combinations where the total is \u22644$. So any combination with a total cost of more than 4$ would not be subtracted. So, from the list above, which of these have a total cost \u22644$?\n\nLet me go through each case:\n\n1. All three Type A: 1.5$ \u2192 yes, include.\n2. Two A, one B: 1.5 \u2192 yes.\n3. Two A, one C: 3 \u2192 yes.\n4. One A, two B: 2.5 \u2192 yes.\n5. One A, one B, one C:3.5 \u2192 yes (since 3.5 \u22644).\n6. One A, two C: 4.5 \u2192 no, this is more than 4. So exclude.\n7. Three B: 3 \u2192 yes.\n8. Two B, one C: 4 \u2192 yes.\n9. One B, two C:5 \u2192 no, exclude.\n10. All three C:6 \u2192 no, exclude.\n\nSo the cases to consider are 1-5 and 7-8.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in case 8: Two B, one C. Each B is $1, so two B is 2, plus one C (2) gives 4$ exactly. So that's included.\n\nSo the cases that have a total \u22644 are:\n\nCase 1: 3A \u21921.5\nCase 2: 2A1B \u21921.5\nCase3:2A1C \u21923\nCase4:1A2B \u21922.5\nCase5:1A1B1C \u21923.5\nCase7:3B \u21923\nCase8:2B1C \u21924\n\nSo these are all the cases that sum to \u22644.\n\nNow, for each of these cases, I need to compute how many ways they can happen, then sum them up to get the total number of 'bad' combinations, which we can subtract from the total (165) to get the desired number.\n\nLet me handle each case one by one.\n\nCase 1: 3A. Since there are 3 A's, the number of ways is C(3,3) =1.\n\nCase2: 2A1B. Number of ways: C(3,2)*C(4,1) =3 *4=12.\n\nCase3:2A1C. C(3,2)*C(4,1)=3 *4=12.\n\nCase4:1A2B. C(3,1)*C(4,2). C(4,2)=6, so 3*6=18.\n\nCase5:1A1B1C. C(3,1)*C(4,1)*C(4,1)=3*4*4=48.\n\nCase7:3B. C(4,3)=4.\n\nCase8:2B1C. C(4,2)*C(4,1)=6 *4=24.\n\nNow, let's add up all these numbers:\n\nCase1: 1\nCase2:12 \u2192 total so far 13\nCase3:12 \u219225\nCase4:18 \u219243\nCase5:48 \u219291\nCase7:4 \u219295\nCase8:24 \u2192119.\n\nSo total 'bad' combinations are 119.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check each case's calculation.\n\nCase1: 3A: C(3,3)=1. Correct.\n\nCase2: 2A1B: 3C2 is 3, 4C1 is4. 3*4=12. Correct.\n\nCase3: 2A1C: same as case2, 3*4=12. Correct.\n\nCase4:1A2B: 3C1=3, 4C2=6. 3*6=18. Correct.\n\nCase5:1A1B1C: 3C1=3, 4C1=4 each. So 3*4*4=48. Correct.\n\nCase7:3B: 4C3=4. Correct.\n\nCase8:2B1C: 4C2=6, 4C1=4. 6*4=24. Correct.\n\nAdding them all: 1+12=13, +12=25, +18=43, +48=91, +4=95, +24=119. So 119 bad combinations.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me think: Are all these cases unique? For example, can any of these cases overlap in some way? Like, could a particular combination be counted in more than one case? I don't think so because each case is a unique combination of types. So no overlaps.\n\nSo the total number of 'bad' combinations is 119. Therefore, the number of good combinations (total >4) is total (165) minus 119.\n\n165-119 =46.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option C is 46. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I account for all the cases where the total is <=4? Let me make sure I didn't miss any.\n\nAnother way to approach this: since we're selecting 3 candy bars, the maximum cost without exceeding 4$ would be 4$.\n\nWhat are the possible combinations that sum to 4 or less?\n\nWait, another approach: list all possible triplets (a, b, c) where a is the number of A's, b the number of B's, and c the number of C's, such that a + b + c =3 and 0.5a +1b +2c \u22644.\n\nBut perhaps I should also check if I missed any triplet combinations. Let's think of all possible (a, b, c) where a + b + c =3.\n\nPossible values of a can be 0,1,2,3.\n\nFor each a, b can range from 0 to (3 -a), and c is determined as 3 -a -b.\n\nLet me list all possible (a, b, c) and compute the cost.\n\na=0:\nb can be 0,1,2,3.\n\nc =3 -0 -b =3 -b.\n\nSo:\n\na=0, b=0, c=3: cost=0 +0 + 6 =6>4 \u2192 not included.\n\na=0, b=1, c=2: 0 +1 +4=5>4 \u2192 not included.\n\na=0, b=2, c=1:0 +2 +2=4 \u2192 include.\n\na=0, b=3, c=0:0 +3 +0=3 \u2192 include.\n\na=1:\n\nb can be 0,1,2.\n\nc=3-1 -b =2 -b.\n\nb=0: a=1, b=0, c=2 \u2192 cost=0.5 +0 +4=4.5>4 \u2192 not included.\n\nb=1: a=1, b=1, c=1 \u21920.5 +1 +2=3.5 \u2192 include.\n\nb=2: a=1, b=2, c=0 \u21920.5 +2 +0=2.5 \u2192 include.\n\na=2:\n\nb can be 0,1.\n\nc=3-2 -b =1 -b.\n\nb=0: a=2, b=0, c=1 \u2192 cost=1 +0 +2=3 \u2192 include.\n\nb=1: a=2, b=1, c=0 \u2192 cost=1 +1 +0=2 \u2192 include.\n\na=3:\n\nb=0, c=0 \u2192 cost=1.5 \u2192 include.\n\nSo now, for each (a,b,c) where 0.5a + b +2c \u22644, I have:\n\nFrom a=0:\n\n(0,2,1) \u2192 cost 4 \u2192 include.\n\n(0,3,0) \u21923 \u2192 include.\n\nFrom a=1:\n\n(1,1,1) \u21923.5 \u2192 include.\n\n(1,2,0) \u21922.5 \u2192 include.\n\nFrom a=2:\n\n(2,0,1) \u21923 \u2192 include.\n\n(2,1,0) \u21922 \u2192 include.\n\nFrom a=3:\n\n(3,0,0) \u21921.5 \u2192 include.\n\nWait, wait. So in this approach, I get the following cases:\n\n(0,2,1), (0,3,0), (1,1,1), (1,2,0), (2,0,1), (2,1,0), (3,0,0).\n\nThat's 7 different cases. Wait, but earlier I had 7 cases? No, earlier I had 7 in the first approach but more in the second. Hmm, perhaps I confused the two approaches.\n\nWait, in the first approach, the cases were:\n\nCase1:3A \u2192 (3,0,0)\nCase2:2A1B \u2192(2,1,0)\nCase3:2A1C\u2192(2,0,1)\nCase4:1A2B\u2192(1,2,0)\nCase5:1A1B1C\u2192(1,1,1)\nCase7:3B\u2192(0,3,0)\nCase8:2B1C\u2192(0,2,1)\n\nSo that's 7 cases. So the same as the second approach. So the same as before.\n\nSo the same 7 cases as before. So the numbers I calculated earlier should be correct.\n\nSo the total 'bad' is 119, so 165-119=46, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Could there be any mistake in the calculations? Because sometimes when I do multiple steps, I might have a miscalculation.\n\nLet me re-calculate the sum of the bad combinations:\n\nCase1: 1\n\nCase2:12 \u2192 total 13\n\nCase3:12 \u219225\n\nCase4:18 \u219243\n\nCase5:48 \u219291\n\nCase7:4 \u219295\n\nCase8:24 \u2192119.\n\nYes, 119. So 165-119=46, which is option C. So the correct answer should be C)46.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to select 3 candy bars from 11 such that their total cost is more than $4.

These combinations are identified by considering all possible distributions of Type A, B, and C candy bars that sum to $4 or less. The valid distributions are:\n\n1. **3A**: Cost = \\(0.5 \\times 3 = 1.5\\).\n2. **2A1B**: Cost = \\(0.5 \\times 2 + 1 = 1.5\\).\n3. **2A1C**: Cost = \\(0.5 \\times 2 + 2 = 3\\).\n4. **1A2B**: Cost = \\(0.5 + 1 \\times 2 = 2.5\\).\n5. **1A1B1C**: Cost = \\(0.5 + 1 + 2 = 3.5\\).\n6. **3B**: Cost = \\(1 \\times 3 = 3\\).\n7. **2B1C**: Cost = \\(1 \\times 2 + 2 = 4\\).\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Number of \"Bad\" Combinations\nFor each valid distribution, the number of ways to select the candy bars is calculated as follows:\n\n1. **3A**: \\(\\binom{3}{3} = 1\\).\n2. **2A1B**: \\(\\binom{3}{2} \\times \\binom{4}{1} = 3 \\times 4 = 12\\).\n3. **2A1C**: \\(\\binom{3}{2} \\times \\binom{4}{1} = 3 \\times 4 = 12\\).\n4. **1A2B**: \\(\\binom{3}{1} \\times \\binom{4}{2} = 3 \\times 6 = 18\\).\n5. **1A1B1C**: \\(\\binom{3}{1} \\times \\binom{4}{1} \\times \\binom{4}{1} = 3 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 48\\).\n6. **3B**: \\(\\binom{4}{3} = 4\\).\n7. **2B1C**: \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{4}{1} = 6 \\times 4 = 24\\).\n\nAdding these, the total number of \"bad\" combinations is:\n\\[\n1 + 12 + 12 + 18 + 48 + 4 + 24 = 119.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate \"Good\" Combinations\nThe number of \"good\" combinations (total cost > $4) is the total combinations minus the \"bad\" combinations:\n\\[\n165 - 119 = 46.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of ways to select 3 candy bars such that the total cost is more than $4 is **46**.\n\nAnswer: C",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about selecting candy bars and figuring out how many ways to get a total cost more than $4. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on combinatorics, but I'll do my best.\n\nFirst, the setup: There are 11 candy bars in total. They're divided into three groups based on their prices. Let me list them out:\n\n- 3 candy bars cost 50 cents each. So those are $0.50 each.\n- 4 candy bars cost $1 each.\n- 4 candy bars cost $2 each.\n\nAnd the question is asking how many ways can we select 3 candy bars such that their total cost is more than $4. The options are A)8, B)28, C)46, D)66, E)70.\n\nHmm, okay. So, the total number of possible ways to select 3 candy bars from 11 is a combination problem. The formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n!/(k!(n-k)!). So 11 choose 3 would be 165. But that's the total without any restrictions. We need to find how many of those combinations have a total cost over $4.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to calculate the total number of possible combinations (which is 165) and subtract the number of combinations where the total cost is $4 or less. That might be simpler because sometimes it's easier to calculate the complement.\n\nSo, the plan is: total combinations (165) minus the number of combinations where the total cost is \u2264$4. The result will be the number of combinations where the total is >$4.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible combinations of candy bars that sum to $4 or less.\n\nEach candy bar can be either 0.5, 1, or 2 dollars. Since we're choosing 3, let's consider all possible combinations of these three types and calculate their total costs.\n\nThe types are:\n\nType A: 0.5$ (3 available)\nType B: 1$ (4 available)\nType C: 2$ (4 available)\n\nWe need to pick 3 candy bars, so let's consider the possible distributions of types.\n\nThe possible distributions when selecting 3 are:\n\n1. All three are Type A: 0.5*3 = 1.5$.\n2. Two Type A, one Type B: 0.5*2 + 1 = 1.0 + 1 = 1.5$.\n3. Two Type A, one Type C: 0.5*2 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3$.\n4. One Type A, two Type B: 0.5 + 2 = 2.5$.\n5. One Type A, one Type B, one Type C: 0.5 +1 +2=3.5$.\n6. One Type A, two Type C: 0.5 + 4=4.5$.\n7. Three Type B: 3$.\n8. Two Type B, one Type C: 2 + 2=4$.\n9. One Type B, two Type C: 1 +4=5$.\n10. All three Type C: 6$.\n\nWait, but wait. We're looking for combinations where the total is \u22644$. So any combination with a total cost of more than 4$ would not be subtracted. So, from the list above, which of these have a total cost \u22644$?\n\nLet me go through each case:\n\n1. All three Type A: 1.5$ \u2192 yes, include.\n2. Two A, one B: 1.5 \u2192 yes.\n3. Two A, one C: 3 \u2192 yes.\n4. One A, two B: 2.5 \u2192 yes.\n5. One A, one B, one C:3.5 \u2192 yes (since 3.5 \u22644).\n6. One A, two C: 4.5 \u2192 no, this is more than 4. So exclude.\n7. Three B: 3 \u2192 yes.\n8. Two B, one C: 4 \u2192 yes.\n9. One B, two C:5 \u2192 no, exclude.\n10. All three C:6 \u2192 no, exclude.\n\nSo the cases to consider are 1-5 and 7-8.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in case 8: Two B, one C. Each B is $1, so two B is 2, plus one C (2) gives 4$ exactly. So that's included.\n\nSo the cases that have a total \u22644 are:\n\nCase 1: 3A \u21921.5\nCase 2: 2A1B \u21921.5\nCase3:2A1C \u21923\nCase4:1A2B \u21922.5\nCase5:1A1B1C \u21923.5\nCase7:3B \u21923\nCase8:2B1C \u21924\n\nSo these are all the cases that sum to \u22644.\n\nNow, for each of these cases, I need to compute how many ways they can happen, then sum them up to get the total number of 'bad' combinations, which we can subtract from the total (165) to get the desired number.\n\nLet me handle each case one by one.\n\nCase 1: 3A. Since there are 3 A's, the number of ways is C(3,3) =1.\n\nCase2: 2A1B. Number of ways: C(3,2)*C(4,1) =3 *4=12.\n\nCase3:2A1C. C(3,2)*C(4,1)=3 *4=12.\n\nCase4:1A2B. C(3,1)*C(4,2). C(4,2)=6, so 3*6=18.\n\nCase5:1A1B1C. C(3,1)*C(4,1)*C(4,1)=3*4*4=48.\n\nCase7:3B. C(4,3)=4.\n\nCase8:2B1C. C(4,2)*C(4,1)=6 *4=24.\n\nNow, let's add up all these numbers:\n\nCase1: 1\nCase2:12 \u2192 total so far 13\nCase3:12 \u219225\nCase4:18 \u219243\nCase5:48 \u219291\nCase7:4 \u219295\nCase8:24 \u2192119.\n\nSo total 'bad' combinations are 119.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check each case's calculation.\n\nCase1: 3A: C(3,3)=1. Correct.\n\nCase2: 2A1B: 3C2 is 3, 4C1 is4. 3*4=12. Correct.\n\nCase3: 2A1C: same as case2, 3*4=12. Correct.\n\nCase4:1A2B: 3C1=3, 4C2=6. 3*6=18. Correct.\n\nCase5:1A1B1C: 3C1=3, 4C1=4 each. So 3*4*4=48. Correct.\n\nCase7:3B: 4C3=4. Correct.\n\nCase8:2B1C: 4C2=6, 4C1=4. 6*4=24. Correct.\n\nAdding them all: 1+12=13, +12=25, +18=43, +48=91, +4=95, +24=119. So 119 bad combinations.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me think: Are all these cases unique? For example, can any of these cases overlap in some way? Like, could a particular combination be counted in more than one case? I don't think so because each case is a unique combination of types. So no overlaps.\n\nSo the total number of 'bad' combinations is 119. Therefore, the number of good combinations (total >4) is total (165) minus 119.\n\n165-119 =46.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option C is 46. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I account for all the cases where the total is <=4? Let me make sure I didn't miss any.\n\nAnother way to approach this: since we're selecting 3 candy bars, the maximum cost without exceeding 4$ would be 4$.\n\nWhat are the possible combinations that sum to 4 or less?\n\nWait, another approach: list all possible triplets (a, b, c) where a is the number of A's, b the number of B's, and c the number of C's, such that a + b + c =3 and 0.5a +1b +2c \u22644.\n\nBut perhaps I should also check if I missed any triplet combinations. Let's think of all possible (a, b, c) where a + b + c =3.\n\nPossible values of a can be 0,1,2,3.\n\nFor each a, b can range from 0 to (3 -a), and c is determined as 3 -a -b.\n\nLet me list all possible (a, b, c) and compute the cost.\n\na=0:\nb can be 0,1,2,3.\n\nc =3 -0 -b =3 -b.\n\nSo:\n\na=0, b=0, c=3: cost=0 +0 + 6 =6>4 \u2192 not included.\n\na=0, b=1, c=2: 0 +1 +4=5>4 \u2192 not included.\n\na=0, b=2, c=1:0 +2 +2=4 \u2192 include.\n\na=0, b=3, c=0:0 +3 +0=3 \u2192 include.\n\na=1:\n\nb can be 0,1,2.\n\nc=3-1 -b =2 -b.\n\nb=0: a=1, b=0, c=2 \u2192 cost=0.5 +0 +4=4.5>4 \u2192 not included.\n\nb=1: a=1, b=1, c=1 \u21920.5 +1 +2=3.5 \u2192 include.\n\nb=2: a=1, b=2, c=0 \u21920.5 +2 +0=2.5 \u2192 include.\n\na=2:\n\nb can be 0,1.\n\nc=3-2 -b =1 -b.\n\nb=0: a=2, b=0, c=1 \u2192 cost=1 +0 +2=3 \u2192 include.\n\nb=1: a=2, b=1, c=0 \u2192 cost=1 +1 +0=2 \u2192 include.\n\na=3:\n\nb=0, c=0 \u2192 cost=1.5 \u2192 include.\n\nSo now, for each (a,b,c) where 0.5a + b +2c \u22644, I have:\n\nFrom a=0:\n\n(0,2,1) \u2192 cost 4 \u2192 include.\n\n(0,3,0) \u21923 \u2192 include.\n\nFrom a=1:\n\n(1,1,1) \u21923.5 \u2192 include.\n\n(1,2,0) \u21922.5 \u2192 include.\n\nFrom a=2:\n\n(2,0,1) \u21923 \u2192 include.\n\n(2,1,0) \u21922 \u2192 include.\n\nFrom a=3:\n\n(3,0,0) \u21921.5 \u2192 include.\n\nWait, wait. So in this approach, I get the following cases:\n\n(0,2,1), (0,3,0), (1,1,1), (1,2,0), (2,0,1), (2,1,0), (3,0,0).\n\nThat's 7 different cases. Wait, but earlier I had 7 cases? No, earlier I had 7 in the first approach but more in the second. Hmm, perhaps I confused the two approaches.\n\nWait, in the first approach, the cases were:\n\nCase1:3A \u2192 (3,0,0)\nCase2:2A1B \u2192(2,1,0)\nCase3:2A1C\u2192(2,0,1)\nCase4:1A2B\u2192(1,2,0)\nCase5:1A1B1C\u2192(1,1,1)\nCase7:3B\u2192(0,3,0)\nCase8:2B1C\u2192(0,2,1)\n\nSo that's 7 cases. So the same as the second approach. So the same as before.\n\nSo the same 7 cases as before. So the numbers I calculated earlier should be correct.\n\nSo the total 'bad' is 119, so 165-119=46, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Could there be any mistake in the calculations? Because sometimes when I do multiple steps, I might have a miscalculation.\n\nLet me re-calculate the sum of the bad combinations:\n\nCase1: 1\n\nCase2:12 \u2192 total 13\n\nCase3:12 \u219225\n\nCase4:18 \u219243\n\nCase5:48 \u219291\n\nCase7:4 \u219295\n\nCase8:24 \u2192119.\n\nYes, 119. So 165-119=46, which is option C. So the correct answer should be C)46.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to select 3 candy bars from 11 such that their total cost is more than $4. The candy bars are divided into three groups based on their prices:\n\n- 3 candy bars cost $0.50 each (Type A),\n- 4 candy bars cost $1 each (Type B),\n- 4 candy bars cost $2 each (Type C).\n\n### Step 1: Total Combinations\nThe total number of ways to select 3 candy bars from 11 is given by the combination formula:\n\\[\n\\binom{11}{3} = \\frac{11!}{3!(11-3)!} = 165.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Identify \"Bad\" Combinations\nWe need to calculate the number of combinations where the total cost is $4 or less. These combinations are identified by considering all possible distributions of Type A, B, and C candy bars that sum to $4 or less. The valid distributions are:\n\n1. **3A**: Cost = \\(0.5 \\times 3 = 1.5\\).\n2. **2A1B**: Cost = \\(0.5 \\times 2 + 1 = 1.5\\).\n3. **2A1C**: Cost = \\(0.5 \\times 2 + 2 = 3\\).\n4. **1A2B**: Cost = \\(0.5 + 1 \\times 2 = 2.5\\).\n5. **1A1B1C**: Cost = \\(0.5 + 1 + 2 = 3.5\\).\n6. **3B**: Cost = \\(1 \\times 3 = 3\\).\n7. **2B1C**: Cost = \\(1 \\times 2 + 2 = 4\\).\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Number of \"Bad\" Combinations\nFor each valid distribution, the number of ways to select the candy bars is calculated as follows:\n\n1. **3A**: \\(\\binom{3}{3} = 1\\).\n2. **2A1B**: \\(\\binom{3}{2} \\times \\binom{4}{1} = 3 \\times 4 = 12\\).\n3. **2A1C**: \\(\\binom{3}{2} \\times \\binom{4}{1} = 3 \\times 4 = 12\\).\n4. **1A2B**: \\(\\binom{3}{1} \\times \\binom{4}{2} = 3 \\times 6 = 18\\).\n5. **1A1B1C**: \\(\\binom{3}{1} \\times \\binom{4}{1} \\times \\binom{4}{1} = 3 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 48\\).\n6. **3B**: \\(\\binom{4}{3} = 4\\).\n7. **2B1C**: \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{4}{1} = 6 \\times 4 = 24\\).\n\nAdding these, the total number of \"bad\" combinations is:\n\\[\n1 + 12 + 12 + 18 + 48 + 4 + 24 = 119.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate \"Good\" Combinations\nThe number of \"good\" combinations (total cost > $4) is the total combinations minus the \"bad\" combinations:\n\\[\n165 - 119 = 46.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of ways to select 3 candy bars such that the total cost is more than $4 is **46**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about candy bars and selecting them with a total cost more than $4. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, the bag has 11 candy bars. They're divided into three groups:\n\n- 3 candy bars at 50 cents each.\n- 4 candy bars at $1 each.\n- 4 candy bars at $2 each.\n\nI need to select 3 candy bars, and the total cost should be more than $4. So, I guess I have to find all possible combinations of 3 candy bars where their total is greater than $4.\n\nFirst, maybe I should calculate the total number of ways to select any 3 candy bars without any restrictions. Then, subtract the number of ways where the total is $4 or less. That might be easier than calculating the desired cases directly.\n\nWait, let's see. The total number of ways to choose 3 from 11 is combination 11 choose 3. The formula for combinations is nCr = n! / (r! (n-r)! ), so 11C3 = (11*10*9)/(3*2*1) = 165. So total possibilities are 165.\n\nBut the problem is asking for more than $4, so I need to find how many of these 165 combinations sum to more than $4. Alternatively, I can find the number of combinations that sum to $4 or less, and subtract that from 165.\n\nHmm, let's think about the possible ways the total can be $4 or less when selecting 3 candy bars.\n\nThe candy bars are priced at $0.50, $1, and $2 each. Let me list all possible combinations of 3 candy bars and their total cost.\n\nBut wait, since there are only three types, maybe I can model this with variables. Let me denote:\n\nLet a = number of 50c candy bars selected (0 \u2264 a \u22643)\nLet b = number of $1 candy bars selected (0 \u2264 b \u22644)\nLet c = number of $2 candy bars selected (0 \u2264 c \u22644)\n\nAnd a + b + c =3.\n\nBut wait, no, because the maximum number for a is 3, but in the bag there are only 3, but when selecting 3, a can be 0,1,2,3.\n\nWait, but the sum a + b + c =3. So all possible triples (a,b,c) where a is 0,1,2,3; b is 0,1,2,3,4; c is 0,1,2,3,4; and a + b + c=3.\n\nNow, I need to find all such (a,b,c) where the total cost (0.5a + 1*b + 2*c) \u22644.\n\nBut since we're dealing with dollars, maybe I can multiply everything by 2 to avoid fractions. So the cost is 1a + 2b +4c \u22648.\n\nSo the condition becomes 1a + 2b +4c \u22648.\n\nBut since a + b + c=3, I can perhaps substitute a = 3 - b - c.\n\nSubstituting into the inequality:\n\n(3 - b - c) + 2b +4c \u22648\n3 -b -c +2b +4c \u22648\n3 + (b + 3c) \u22648\nSo, (b +3c) \u22645.\n\nBecause 3 + (b+3c) \u22648 \u2192 b+3c \u22645.\n\nNow, since a, b, c are non-negative integers, and a =3 -b -c must be \u22650, so b +c \u22643.\n\nSo I have two constraints:\n\n1. b + c \u22643\n2. b +3c \u22645\n\nI need to find all possible (b, c) that satisfy both, then compute a=3 -b -c.\n\nLet me list all possible (b, c) pairs:\n\nc can be 0,1,2,3, but since b + c \u22643, c can be up to 3.\n\nLet me start with c=0:\n\nc=0:\nConstraints:\nb \u22643 (from b +c \u22643)\nand b \u22645 (from b+3c \u22645, since 3c=0 \u2192 b \u22645)\nBut since b can't be more than 4 (from the bag's available quantity), but in this case, since a=3 -b -0, b can't exceed 3. So for c=0, possible b is 0,1,2,3.\n\nSo for c=0:\nb=0 \u2192 a=3\nb=1 \u2192 a=2\nb=2 \u2192a=1\nb=3 \u2192a=0\n\nNow check if these satisfy the cost condition (1a +2b +4c) \u22648.\n\nWait, but earlier we derived that (b+3c) \u22645. For c=0, any b up to 3 would satisfy b \u22645. So all four cases are acceptable.\n\nNow c=1:\n\nNow, c=1. So:\n\nb +3*1 \u22645 \u2192 b \u22642.\n\nAnd b +1 \u22643 \u2192b \u22642.\n\nSo b can be 0,1,2.\n\nCheck each:\n\nb=0 \u2192 a=2 \u2192 cost: 2*1 +0*2 +1*4 = 2 +0 +4=6 \u22648? Yes.\nWait, no: wait, the cost is 0.5a +1*b +2*c. So for a=2, b=0, c=1: 2*0.5 +0*1 +1*2 = 1 +0 +2=3 \u22644? Yes. So it's acceptable.\n\nWait, but earlier substitution may have messed things up. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the substitution was that 1a + 2b +4c \u22648, which is the cost multiplied by 2. So for each (a,b,c), compute 1a +2b +4c and see if it's \u22648.\n\nSo for c=1:\n\nb can be 0,1,2.\n\nFor each:\n\nb=0:\na=2 \u2192 2 +0 +4*1= 6 \u22648 \u2192 yes.\n\nb=1:\na=1 \u21921 +2 +4=7 \u22648 \u2192 yes.\n\nb=2:\na=0 \u21920 +4 +4=8 \u22648 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo all three cases are acceptable.\n\nNow c=2:\n\nc=2.\n\nConstraints:\n\nb +3*2 \u22645 \u2192b \u2264-1 \u2192 impossible. So no possible b here.\n\nWait, 3*2 is 6. So b +6 \u22645 \u2192 b \u2264-1 \u2192 no solution. So c=2 is not possible.\n\nWait, but wait, another constraint is b +c \u22643. c=2 \u2192 b \u22641.\n\nBut since b +3c \u22645 \u2192 b +6 \u22645 \u2192 b \u2264-1. So no solutions.\n\nSo c=2: no possible b.\n\nc=3:\n\nc=3.\n\nb +3*3 \u22645 \u2192b \u2264-4 \u2192 impossible.\n\nAlso, b +3 \u22643 \u2192b=0.\n\nBut then, b=0, c=3 \u2192 a=0.\n\nBut 0 +3*3=9 >5 \u2192 doesn't satisfy.\n\nSo c=3: no solutions.\n\nSo all possible (b,c) pairs are:\n\nc=0: b=0,1,2,3.\n\nc=1: b=0,1,2.\n\nc=2: no.\n\nc=3: no.\n\nNow for each (b,c) pair, calculate the corresponding a, and then compute how many ways each (a,b,c) can be selected.\n\nBut wait, the number of ways for each (a,b,c) is (number of ways to choose a 50c bars) \u00d7 (ways to choose b $1 bars) \u00d7 (ways to choose c $2 bars).\n\nSo for each (a,b,c), the number of combinations is:\n\nC(3, a) \u00d7 C(4, b) \u00d7 C(4, c).\n\nBut wait, because:\n\n- There are 3 50c bars. So choosing a of them is C(3,a).\n- There are 4 $1 bars, so C(4,b).\n- 4 $2 bars, so C(4,c).\n\nBut each selection must satisfy a + b + c =3.\n\nSo for each of the (a,b,c) triplets we found earlier, compute the product.\n\nLet me list all possible (a,b,c) and compute their counts.\n\nCase 1: c=0.\n\na=3, b=0: C(3,3) * C(4,0) * C(4,0) =1*1*1=1.\n\na=2, b=1: C(3,2)*C(4,1)*C(4,0) =3 *4 *1=12.\n\na=1, b=2: C(3,1)*C(4,2)*C(4,0)=3 *6 *1=18.\n\na=0, b=3: C(3,0)*C(4,3)*C(4,0)=1 *4 *1=4.\n\nSo total for c=0: 1 +12 +18 +4 =35.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations:\n\na=3, b=0: 1*1*1=1.\n\na=2, b=1: 3*4=12 \u2192 12*1=12.\n\na=1, b=2: 3 * (4 choose 2)=3*6=18.\n\na=0, b=3: 1*(4 choose 3)=4.\n\nYes, sum is 1+12=13, 13+18=31, 31+4=35.\n\nCase 2: c=1.\n\nb can be 0,1,2.\n\na=2, b=0, c=1: C(3,2)*C(4,0)*C(4,1) =3 *1 *4=12.\n\na=1, b=1, c=1: C(3,1)*C(4,1)*C(4,1)=3*4*4=48.\n\na=0, b=2, c=1: C(3,0)*C(4,2)*C(4,1)=1 *6 *4=24.\n\nSo sum for c=1: 12 +48 +24 =84.\n\nWait, let me compute again:\n\na=2, b=0: 3 *1 *4=12.\n\na=1, b=1: 3 *4 *4=48.\n\na=0, b=2: 1 *6 *4=24.\n\n12 +48=60; 60 +24=84.\n\nSo c=0 gives 35, c=1 gives 84. Any more cases?\n\nNo, because c=2 and above give nothing.\n\nSo total number of combinations where total cost is \u2264$4 is 35 +84=119.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check if I considered all possibilities correctly.\n\nWait, for c=1, b can be 0,1,2. So a=2,1,0 respectively. So yes.\n\nSo the total number of \"bad\" combinations (cost \u22644) is 35 +84=119.\n\nSo the total desired is total combinations (165) minus bad combinations (119) \u2192 165-119=46.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 46.\n\nSo the answer should be C)46.\n",

So no solutions.\n\nSo c=2: no possible b.\n\nc=3:\n\nc=3.\n\nb +3*3 \u22645 \u2192b \u2264-4 \u2192 impossible.\n\nAlso, b +3 \u22643 \u2192b=0.\n\nBut then, b=0, c=3 \u2192 a=0.\n\nBut 0 +3*3=9 >5 \u2192 doesn't satisfy.\n\nSo c=3: no solutions.\n\nSo all possible (b,c) pairs are:\n\nc=0: b=0,1,2,3.\n\nc=1: b=0,1,2.\n\nc=2: no.\n\nc=3: no.\n\nNow for each (b,c) pair, calculate the corresponding a, and then compute how many ways each (a,b,c) can be selected.\n\nBut wait, the number of ways for each (a,b,c) is (number of ways to choose a 50c bars) \u00d7 (ways to choose b $1 bars) \u00d7 (ways to choose c $2 bars).\n\nSo for each (a,b,c), the number of combinations is:\n\nC(3, a) \u00d7 C(4, b) \u00d7 C(4, c).\n\nBut wait, because:\n\n- There are 3 50c bars. So choosing a of them is C(3,a).\n- There are 4 $1 bars, so C(4,b).\n- 4 $2 bars, so C(4,c).\n\nBut each selection must satisfy a + b + c =3.\n\nSo for each of the (a,b,c) triplets we found earlier, compute the product.\n\nLet me list all possible (a,b,c) and compute their counts.\n\nCase 1: c=0.\n\na=3, b=0: C(3,3) * C(4,0) * C(4,0) =1*1*1=1.\n\na=2, b=1: C(3,2)*C(4,1)*C(4,0) =3 *4 *1=12.\n\na=1, b=2: C(3,1)*C(4,2)*C(4,0)=3 *6 *1=18.\n\na=0, b=3: C(3,0)*C(4,3)*C(4,0)=1 *4 *1=4.\n\nSo total for c=0: 1 +12 +18 +4 =35.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations:\n\na=3, b=0: 1*1*1=1.\n\na=2, b=1: 3*4=12 \u2192 12*1=12.\n\na=1, b=2: 3 * (4 choose 2)=3*6=18.\n\na=0, b=3: 1*(4 choose 3)=4.\n\nYes, sum is 1+12=13, 13+18=31, 31+4=35.\n\nCase 2: c=1.\n\nb can be 0,1,2.\n\na=2, b=0, c=1: C(3,2)*C(4,0)*C(4,1) =3 *1 *4=12.\n\na=1, b=1, c=1: C(3,1)*C(4,1)*C(4,1)=3*4*4=48.\n\na=0, b=2, c=1: C(3,0)*C(4,2)*C(4,1)=1 *6 *4=24.\n\nSo sum for c=1: 12 +48 +24 =84.\n\nWait, let me compute again:\n\na=2, b=0: 3 *1 *4=12.\n\na=1, b=1: 3 *4 *4=48.\n\na=0, b=2: 1 *6 *4=24.\n\n12 +48=60; 60 +24=84.\n\nSo c=0 gives 35, c=1 gives 84. Any more cases?\n\nNo, because c=2 and above give nothing.\n\nSo total number of combinations where total cost is \u2264$4 is 35 +84=119.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check if I considered all possibilities correctly.\n\nWait, for c=1, b can be 0,1,2. So a=2,1,0 respectively. So yes.\n\nSo the total number of \"bad\" combinations (cost \u22644) is 35 +84=119.\n\nSo the total desired is total combinations (165) minus bad combinations (119) \u2192 165-119=46.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 46.\n\nSo the answer should be C)46.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to select 3 candy bars from a bag containing 11 candy bars (3 at 50 cents, 4 at $1, and 4 at $2) such that the total cost exceeds $4. \n\n### Step 1: Total number of ways to select 3 candy bars\nThe total number of ways to select 3 candy bars from 11 is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{11}{3} = \\frac{11!}{3!(11-3)!} = 165\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Identify combinations where the total cost is \u2264 $4\nTo find the number of combinations where the total cost is \u2264 $4, we consider the prices of the candy bars:\n- 50 cents: \\(a\\) (0 \u2264 \\(a\\) \u2264 3)\n- $1: \\(b\\) (0 \u2264 \\(b\\) \u2264 4)\n- $2: \\(c\\) (0 \u2264 \\(c\\) \u2264 4)\n\nThe total cost is \\(0.5a + 1b + 2c\\). To simplify, multiply the cost by 2 to eliminate fractions: \\(a + 2b + 4c \\leq 8\\). Additionally, \\(a + b + c = 3\\).\n\nSubstituting \\(a = 3 - b - c\\) into the inequality:\n\n\\[\n(3 - b - c) + 2b + 4c \\leq 8 \\implies 3 + b + 3c \\leq 8 \\implies b + 3c \\leq 5\n\\]\n\nWe also have the constraint \\(a + b + c = 3\\), so \\(b + c \\leq 3\\). Combining these, we solve for valid \\((b, c)\\) pairs:\n\n#### Case 1: \\(c = 0\\)\n- \\(b + 3c \\leq 5\\) becomes \\(b \\leq 5\\), but since \\(b + c \\leq 3\\), \\(b \\leq 3\\).\n- Possible pairs: \\((b, c) = (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0)\\).\n\n#### Case 2: \\(c = 1\\)\n- \\(b + 3c \\leq 5\\) becomes \\(b \\leq 2\\), and \\(b + c \\leq 3\\) also gives \\(b \\leq 2\\).\n- Possible pairs: \\((b, c) = (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1)\\).\n\n#### Case 3: \\(c = 2\\)\n- \\(b + 3c \\leq 5\\) becomes \\(b \\leq -1\\), which is impossible. No valid pairs.\n\n#### Case 4: \\(c = 3\\)\n- \\(b + 3c \\leq 5\\) becomes \\(b \\leq -4\\), which is impossible. No valid pairs.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the number of ways for each valid \\((a, b, c)\\)\nFor each valid \\((a, b, c)\\), the number of ways is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ways} = \\binom{3}{a} \\times \\binom{4}{b} \\times \\binom{4}{c}\n\\]\n\n#### Case 1: \\(c = 0\\)\n- \\((a, b, c) = (3, 0, 0)\\): \\(\\binom{3}{3} \\times \\binom{4}{0} \\times \\binom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\((a, b, c) = (2, 1, 0)\\): \\(\\binom{3}{2} \\times \\binom{4}{1} \\times \\binom{4}{0} = 3 \\times 4 = 12\\)\n- \\((a, b, c) = (1, 2, 0)\\): \\(\\binom{3}{1} \\times \\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{4}{0} = 3 \\times 6 = 18\\)\n- \\((a, b, c) = (0, 3, 0)\\): \\(\\binom{3}{0} \\times \\binom{4}{3} \\times \\binom{4}{0} = 1 \\times 4 = 4\\)\n\nTotal for \\(c = 0\\): \\(1 + 12 + 18 + 4 = 35\\).\n\n#### Case 2: \\(c = 1\\)\n- \\((a, b, c) = (2, 0, 1)\\): \\(\\binom{3}{2} \\times \\binom{4}{0} \\times \\binom{4}{1} = 3 \\times 1 \\times 4 = 12\\)\n- \\((a, b, c) = (1, 1, 1)\\): \\(\\binom{3}{1} \\times \\binom{4}{1} \\times \\binom{4}{1} = 3 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 48\\)\n- \\((a, b, c) = (0, 2, 1)\\): \\(\\binom{3}{0} \\times \\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{4}{1} = 1 \\times 6 \\times 4 = 24\\)\n\nTotal for \\(c = 1\\): \\(12 + 48 + 24 = 84\\).\n\n### Step 4: Total \"bad\" combinations\nThe total number of combinations where the cost is \u2264 $4 is:\n\n\\[\n35 + 84 = 119\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the desired combinations\nThe total number of valid combinations where the cost is > $4 is:\n\n\\[\n165 - 119 = 46\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of ways to select 3 candy bars with a total cost exceeding $4 is **46**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about candy bars and combinations. Hmm, let me see. The question is about selecting 3 candy bars from a bag, and we need the total cost to be more than $4. There are 11 candy bars in total, divided into three groups: three are 50 cents each, four are $1 each, and four are $2 each. \n\nAlright, the first thing I need to figure out is how to approach this. Since the question is about combinations and total cost, I think I should calculate all possible ways to pick 3 candy bars and then subtract the ones that don't meet the cost condition. Alternatively, I could directly calculate the number of combinations that give a total cost over $4. \n\nWait, but considering the problem structure, maybe it's easier to find all possible combinations and then subtract those that cost $4 or less. Let me think about the total number of ways to choose 3 candy bars from 11. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! (n-k)! ). So C(11,3) is 165. But wait, the options don't have 165, so maybe that's not the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the valid combinations directly.\n\nWait, no, the options are 8, 28, 46, 66, 70. So the correct answer must be one of those. Let me think again.\n\nWait, I should probably list all possible combinations of the candy bars and calculate their costs. Since there are three types, let's denote them as A (50c), B ($1), and C ($2). So, the possible combinations when picking 3 could be:\n\n1. All three are A: 3 * 0.50 = $1.50 \u2192 which is way below $4.\n2. Two A's and one B: (2 * 0.50) + 1 = $2 \u2192 still below.\n3. Two A's and one C: 2*0.50 + 2 = $3 \u2192 still below.\n4. One A, two B's: 0.50 + 2*1 = $2.50 \u2192 below.\n5. One A, one B, one C: 0.50 + 1 + 2 = $3.50 \u2192 below.\n6. One A and two C's: 0.50 + 2*2 = $4.50 \u2192 above $4.\n7. Three B's: 3 * 1 = $3 \u2192 below.\n8. Two B's and one C: 2*1 + 2 = $4 \u2192 exactly $4, which doesn't satisfy more than $4.\n9. One B and two C's: 1 + 2*2 = $5 \u2192 above.\n10. Three C's: 3*2= $6 \u2192 above.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any combinations. The possible groupings are based on how many of each type are selected. So the possible combinations are:\n\n- 3A, 2A1B, 2A1C, 1A2B, 1A1B1C, 1A2C, 3B, 2B1C, 1B2C, 3C.\n\nWait, but some of these might not be possible because we have limited quantities. For example, 3A is possible since there are 3 A's. 2A1B is possible because there are 4 B's. 2A1C is possible because there are 4 C's. 1A2B is possible, since 4 B's available. 1A1B1C is possible. 1A2C is possible, as 4 C's are there. 3B is possible, since 4 B's are present. 2B1C is possible, same as above. 1B2C is possible, and 3C is possible because 4 C's are available.\n\nWait, but perhaps some of the combinations I listed earlier don't actually meet the cost condition. Let me list all the possible cost scenarios and see which ones exceed $4.\n\nSo, let's go through each possible combination of types and compute the total cost.\n\n1. 3A: 3 * 0.5 = 1.5 \u2192 less than 4.\n2. 2A 1B: 2*0.5 + 1 = 1 +1=2 \u2192 less.\n3. 2A 1C: 2*0.5 +2=1+2=3 \u2192 less.\n4. 1A 2B: 0.5 + 2*1=2.5 \u2192 less.\n5. 1A 1B 1C: 0.5+1+2=3.5 \u2192 less.\n6. 1A 2C: 0.5 + 4 =4.5 \u2192 more than 4.\n7. 3B: 3 \u2192 less.\n8. 2B 1C: 2 +2=4 \u2192 exactly 4, which doesn't satisfy 'more than 4'.\n9. 1B 2C: 1 +4=5 \u2192 more than 4.\n10. 3C:6 \u2192 more than 4.\n\nWait, but I think I might have missed some combinations. Let me re-examine. Are there any other ways to select 3 candy bars?\n\nWait, no, I think I covered all the possible type combinations. So the combinations that result in a total cost more than $4 are:\n\n- 1A 2C \u2192 cost 4.5\n- 1B 2C \u2192 cost 5\n- 3C \u2192 cost 6\n\nWait, but wait another thing: 2B 1C gives exactly $4, so it doesn't count. So the valid cases are the three I just listed. Now I need to calculate how many ways each of these can be selected.\n\nLet me compute each case:\n\nCase 1: 1A 2C. \n\nWe have 3 A's and 4 C's. So the number of ways to choose 1A is C(3,1) =3. For the 2C's, it's C(4,2)=6. So the total for this case is 3 *6=18 ways.\n\nCase 2: 1B 2C.\n\nWe have 4 B's and 4 C's. So choosing 1B is C(4,1)=4. Choosing 2C's is C(4,2)=6. So total ways for this case: 4*6=24.\n\nCase 3: 3C.\n\nWe have 4 C's. The number of ways to choose 3 is C(4,3)=4.\n\nSo adding them all up: 18 +24 +4=46.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Are there any other cases that I missed?\n\nWait, what about 3B's? Oh, wait no, 3B's cost $3, which is less than $4. So that's not a valid case.\n\nAnother possibility: what about 2B and 1C? No, because that gives exactly $4, which is not more than $4.\n\nWait, another case: 0A, 1B, 2C. Wait, no, that's the same as case 2.\n\nWait, or 0A, 0B, 3C: that's case 3.\n\nHmm, I think I accounted for all possibilities.\n\nWait, another thought: what about 0A, 2B, 1C? No, that's 2B and 1C, which is exactly $4. So it doesn't count.\n\nAnother possibility: 0A, 3B's. No, that's $3, which doesn't meet.\n\nWait, are there any other combinations where the cost is more than $4? Let's see.\n\nWait, what about 2C's and 1B: that's 2*2 +1=5. Which is covered in case 2.\n\nAnother case: 2C and 1A: that's 4.5, which is case 1.\n\nWait, what about 3C's: that's case 3.\n\nWait, any other combinations?\n\nWait, 1C, 2B: 2 + 2=4 \u2192 no.\n\nWait, 3C is 6, which is valid.\n\nWait, 1A, 1B, 1C: 0.5 +1 +2=3.5 \u2192 no.\n\nWait, what about 2B and 1C: 2*1 +2=4 \u2192 exactly 4, which doesn't count.\n\nWait, maybe I missed a case where two C's and one A: that's case 1.\n\nWait, is there any other combination that sums to more than 4?\n\nHmm, perhaps not. So the total number of ways is 18 +24 +4=46. So the answer should be 46, which is option C.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, for case 1: 1A and 2C.\n\nNumber of ways: C(3,1)*C(4,2)=3*6=18. That seems correct.\n\nCase 2: 1B and 2C: C(4,1)*C(4,2)=4*6=24.\n\nCase 3: 3C: C(4,3)=4.\n\n18+24=42 +4=46. Yep, that adds up.\n\nSo the answer should be 46, which is option C.\n",

So the number of ways to choose 1A is C(3,1) =3. For the 2C's, it's C(4,2)=6. So the total for this case is 3 *6=18 ways.\n\nCase 2: 1B 2C.\n\nWe have 4 B's and 4 C's. So choosing 1B is C(4,1)=4. Choosing 2C's is C(4,2)=6. So total ways for this case: 4*6=24.\n\nCase 3: 3C.\n\nWe have 4 C's. The number of ways to choose 3 is C(4,3)=4.\n\nSo adding them all up: 18 +24 +4=46.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Are there any other cases that I missed?\n\nWait, what about 3B's? Oh, wait no, 3B's cost $3, which is less than $4. So that's not a valid case.\n\nAnother possibility: what about 2B and 1C? No, because that gives exactly $4, which is not more than $4.\n\nWait, another case: 0A, 1B, 2C. Wait, no, that's the same as case 2.\n\nWait, or 0A, 0B, 3C: that's case 3.\n\nHmm, I think I accounted for all possibilities.\n\nWait, another thought: what about 0A, 2B, 1C? No, that's 2B and 1C, which is exactly $4. So it doesn't count.\n\nAnother possibility: 0A, 3B's. No, that's $3, which doesn't meet.\n\nWait, are there any other combinations where the cost is more than $4? Let's see.\n\nWait, what about 2C's and 1B: that's 2*2 +1=5. Which is covered in case 2.\n\nAnother case: 2C and 1A: that's 4.5, which is case 1.\n\nWait, what about 3C's: that's case 3.\n\nWait, any other combinations?\n\nWait, 1C, 2B: 2 + 2=4 \u2192 no.\n\nWait, 3C is 6, which is valid.\n\nWait, 1A, 1B, 1C: 0.5 +1 +2=3.5 \u2192 no.\n\nWait, what about 2B and 1C: 2*1 +2=4 \u2192 exactly 4, which doesn't count.\n\nWait, maybe I missed a case where two C's and one A: that's case 1.\n\nWait, is there any other combination that sums to more than 4?\n\nHmm, perhaps not. So the total number of ways is 18 +24 +4=46. So the answer should be 46, which is option C.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, for case 1: 1A and 2C.\n\nNumber of ways: C(3,1)*C(4,2)=3*6=18. That seems correct.\n\nCase 2: 1B and 2C: C(4,1)*C(4,2)=4*6=24.\n\nCase 3: 3C: C(4,3)=4.\n\n18+24=42 +4=46. Yep, that adds up.\n\nSo the answer should be 46, which is option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to select 3 candy bars from a bag containing 11 candy bars (3 at $0.50, 4 at $1, and 4 at $2) such that the total cost exceeds $4. \n\n### Step 1: Identify valid combinations\nWe analyze all possible combinations of candy bars and calculate their total costs:\n\n1. **3A**: \\(3 \\times 0.50 = 1.50\\) (less than $4).\n2. **2A + 1B**: \\(2 \\times 0.50 + 1 = 2.00\\) (less than $4).\n3. **2A + 1C**: \\(2 \\times 0.50 + 2 = 3.00\\) (less than $4).\n4. **1A + 2B**: \\(0.50 + 2 \\times 1 = 2.50\\) (less than $4).\n5. **1A + 1B + 1C**: \\(0.50 + 1 + 2 = 3.50\\) (less than $4).\n6. **1A + 2C**: \\(0.50 + 2 \\times 2 = 4.50\\) (more than $4).\n7. **3B**: \\(3 \\times 1 = 3.00\\) (less than $4).\n8. **2B + 1C**: \\(2 \\times 1 + 2 = 4.00\\) (exactly $4, not more than $4).\n9. **1B + 2C**: \\(1 + 2 \\times 2 = 5.00\\) (more than $4).\n10. **3C**: \\(3 \\times 2 = 6.00\\) (more than $4).\n\nFrom this analysis, the valid combinations that exceed $4 are:\n- **1A + 2C**.\n- **1B + 2C**.\n- **3C**.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the number of ways for each valid combination\n1. **1A + 2C**:\n   - Choose 1A from 3 available: \\(C(3,1) = 3\\).\n   - Choose 2C from 4 available: \\(C(4,2) = 6\\).\n   - Total ways: \\(3 \\times 6 = 18\\).\n\n2. **1B + 2C**:\n   - Choose 1B from 4 available: \\(C(4,1) = 4\\).\n   - Choose 2C from 4 available: \\(C(4,2) = 6\\).\n   - Total ways: \\(4 \\times 6 = 24\\).\n\n3. **3C**:\n   - Choose 3C from 4 available: \\(C(4,3) = 4\\).\n\n### Step 3: Sum the total number of valid ways\nAdding the results from the valid combinations:\n\\[\n18 + 24 + 4 = 46.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe total number of ways to select 3 candy bars such that the total cost is more than $4 is **46**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about selecting candy bars from a bag, and I need to figure out how many ways I can pick three such that their total cost is more than $4. Hmm. Let me try to break it down.\n\nAlright, the bag has 11 candy bars in total. They are divided into three groups based on their cost:\n\n- Three candy bars cost 50 cents each.\n- Four candy bars cost $1 each.\n- Four candy bars cost $2 each.\n\nSo, the first thing I think is that the problem is a combinatorics question. I need to calculate the number of combinations where the sum of the costs of the three selected candy bars exceeds $4.\n\nLet me think about the possible combinations of candy bars. Since the order doesn't matter, it's about how many of each type we pick. So the variables are the number of each type selected: let's say x candy bars of 50 cents, y of $1, and z of $2. And x + y + z = 3, with x, y, z being non-negative integers.\n\nBut wait, the maximum number for each type is limited by the number available. So x can be 0, 1, 2, or 3 (since there are three 50-cent bars). Similarly, y can be 0 up to 4, and z can be 0 up to 4. But since we're only selecting three, some combinations might not be possible.\n\nThe total cost needs to be more than $4. Let's convert everything to cents to avoid confusion. $4 is 400 cents. So the total cost in cents must be more than 400.\n\nSo each candy bar's cost in cents is:\n\n- 50 cents (let's call this A)\n- 100 cents (B)\n- 200 cents (C)\n\nWe need to select 3, so x + y + z = 3. And 50x + 100y + 200z > 400.\n\nLet me list all possible combinations of (x, y, z) that satisfy x + y + z =3, and then check which of these meet the cost condition.\n\nWait, but that might take a while. Maybe a better approach is to find all possible ways to pick three candy bars and subtract those that cost 400 cents or less.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the total number of ways to pick any three, then subtract the number of ways where the total is <=400 cents.\n\nWait, the total number of ways to choose 3 from 11 is C(11,3) = 165. So if I can find the number of ways where the total is <=4, then subtract that from 165, I'll get the answer.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Calculate total ways: 165.\n2. Find the number of ways where the total is <=400 cents.\n3. Subtract that from 165 to get the answer.\n\nBut wait, 400 cents is $4. So total cost must be >$4, which is >400 cents.\n\nSo let's find all possible combinations of x, y, z where x + y + z =3, and 50x +100y +200z <=400.\n\nBut since we're dealing with three candy bars, the maximum possible cost is 3*200 =600 cents. So the other end is 150 cents (3*50). So we're interested in the cases where the sum is between 150 and 400, inclusive. But wait, no, the sum can be anything. Wait, no, wait: the sum can be up to 600. But our condition is sum >400, so sum >=401.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute the number of ways where sum <=400, and subtract that from the total.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of ways where the total cost is <=400.\n\nSo, for each possible combination (x, y, z) where x + y + z =3, check if 50x +100y +200z <=400.\n\nLet me think about possible values of z, since each z contributes 200, which is a lot.\n\nCase 1: z=0.\n\nThen, the cost is 50x +100y. Since z=0, x + y =3.\n\nWe need 50x +100y <=400.\n\nDivide both sides by 50: x + 2y <=8.\n\nBut since x + y =3, substitute x=3-y. So (3 - y) + 2y <=8 \u2192 3 + y <=8 \u2192 y <=5.\n\nBut y can't be more than 3 since x + y=3, so y can be 0,1,2,3.\n\nSo for z=0, all possible (x,y) combinations where x + y=3 will have total cost 50x +100y.\n\nLet's compute the maximum possible cost for z=0: when y=3, x=0: 3*100=300. So 300 <=400, which is true. So all combinations where z=0 are acceptable.\n\nSo number of ways when z=0: number of ways to choose x, y, z with z=0 and x+y=3.\n\nBut wait, the candy bars are of different types. So for each possible (x,y), the number of ways is C(3, x) * C(4, y) * C(4, z), but since z=0, it's C(3, x)*C(4, y).\n\nBut x + y =3.\n\nSo possible (x, y) pairs:\n\n(0,3), (1,2), (2,1), (3,0).\n\nBut we also need to consider the constraints on the number of available candy bars. For example, y can't be more than 4, which it isn't in these cases.\n\nSo compute for each (x, y):\n\n(0,3): x=0, y=3. But wait, there are only 3 A's (50c). So x can't be 3 unless there are three A's. Wait, no, x is the number of A's selected, which can be up to 3. So (0,3) is y=3: but there are 4 B's, so it's possible.\n\nSo for (0,3):\n\nC(3,0)*C(4,3) = 1 * 4 =4.\n\n(1,2): C(3,1)*C(4,2)=3 *6=18.\n\n(2,1): C(3,2)*C(4,1)=3 *4=12.\n\n(3,0): C(3,3)*C(4,0)=1*1=1.\n\nTotal for z=0: 4 +18 +12 +1 =35.\n\nCase 2: z=1.\n\nNow, x + y +1 =3 \u2192 x + y =2.\n\nTotal cost: 50x +100y +200*1 =50x +100y +200.\n\nWe need 50x +100y +200 <=400 \u2192 50x +100y <=200 \u2192 x + 2y <=4.\n\nBut x + y =2.\n\nSo substitute x=2 - y.\n\n(2 - y) + 2y <=4 \u2192 2 + y <=4 \u2192 y <=2.\n\nSo y can be 0,1,2.\n\nSo for each possible (x, y):\n\ny=0 \u2192 x=2.\n\ny=1 \u2192 x=1.\n\ny=2 \u2192 x=0.\n\nNow, check if these are possible.\n\nFor each (x, y):\n\n(2,0): x=2, y=0. Are there enough A's and B's? Yes, since A has 3, B has 4.\n\nNumber of ways: C(3,2)*C(4,0)*C(4,1) =3 *1 *4=12.\n\nWait, wait: when z=1, C(4,1) for the C's.\n\nWait, the formula is C(A, x) * C(B, y) * C(C, z).\n\nSo for (x=2, y=0, z=1):\n\nC(3,2) * C(4,0) * C(4,1) =3 *1 *4=12.\n\n(1,1,1): x=1, y=1, z=1.\n\nC(3,1)*C(4,1)*C(4,1) =3 *4 *4=48.\n\n(0,2,1): x=0, y=2, z=1.\n\nC(3,0)*C(4,2)*C(4,1)=1*6*4=24.\n\nSo adding these up:12 +48 +24 =84.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, let me double-check. The conditions are that the sum 50x +100y +200z <=400. So for z=1, the max x and y are such that x + 2y <=4, with x+y=2.\n\nWait, but in the case of (x=2, y=0, z=1), the cost is 2*50 +0 +200=100 +200=300 \u2264400. So acceptable.\n\nSimilarly, (x=1, y=1, z=1): 50 +100 +200=350 \u2264400. Yes.\n\n(x=0, y=2, z=1): 0 +200 +200=400 \u2192 exactly 400. So this is acceptable.\n\nSo all three cases are allowed.\n\nSo for z=1, the total is 12 +48 +24=84.\n\nCase 3: z=2.\n\nNow, x + y +2 =3 \u2192 x + y =1.\n\nTotal cost:50x +100y +400.\n\nWe need 50x +100y +400 <=400 \u2192 50x +100y <=0 \u2192 x=0 and y=0.\n\nBecause 50x +100y can't be negative, so the only possible solution is x=0, y=0, z=2.\n\nBut x + y =1. So 0 +0=0 !=1. So no solution. Therefore, no possible combinations when z=2.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, x + y =1.\n\nAnd 50x +100y +400 <=400 \u219250x +100y <=0 \u2192 x=0, y=0.\n\nBut x + y must be 1, so that's impossible. So no solutions in this case.\n\nSo z=2 is not possible.\n\nCase 4: z=3.\n\nBut then x + y +3=3 \u2192x + y=0 \u2192 x=0, y=0, z=3.\n\nBut we're only selecting 3 candy bars, so z=3 would require selecting all three from the C's. But the cost would be 3*200=600>400, but in this case, we're considering the case where sum is <=400, so this would not be included. But wait, this is for the sum <=400. So, z=3 would be 600>400, which doesn't satisfy, so it's not counted in the <=400 category.\n\nBut in this case, since x + y=0, the only possibility is (0,0,3). But x + y =0, but when z=3, the cost is 600 which is more than 400. So for the sum <=400, this is not counted.\n\nSo, for z >=2, no solutions.\n\nSo, the only possible z values are 0 and 1.\n\nSo the total number of ways where sum <=400 is 35 (z=0) +84 (z=1) =119.\n\nWait, but wait, let me recount the numbers.\n\nWait, for z=0, I had 35. For z=1, 84. So total is 35 +84=119.\n\nSo the total number of ways where sum >400 is total ways (165) minus 119=46.\n\nSo the answer would be 46, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, for z=0, the number of ways was 35. For z=1, 84. 35+84=119.\n\nTotal ways: 165. 165-119=46. So yes, option C is 46.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miss any cases.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to think about the possible ways where the sum is greater than 400. So let's think about the combinations that would give a sum >400.\n\nEach C candy bar is 200 cents. So if I have two C's, that's 400, plus any other candy bar (even a B, which is 100) would make 500>400. So any combination with two or three C's would automatically satisfy the condition.\n\nWait, but let me think: 2 C's and 1 other: 2*200 + (50 or 100 or 200).\n\nWait, 2 C's plus another C: 3*200=600>400.\n\nBut wait, if I have two C's and one A: 400 +50=450>400. So that's acceptable.\n\nSimilarly, two C's and a B: 400 +100=500>400.\n\nSo, any selection with two or more C's would satisfy the condition.\n\nBut wait, wait, what about three C's? Well, that's 600, which is more than 400. So yes.\n\nBut also, what about one C and two B's: 200 + 2*100=400, which is exactly 400, so not more than 400. So that combination (1C, 2B) is exactly 400, which doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\nSo the combinations that meet the condition are:\n\n1. All three C's: 3C.\n\n2. Two C's and any other candy bar (A, B, or C).\n\n3. One C and two B's: 1C, 2B \u2192 sum is exactly 400 \u2192 not included.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, for one C and two B's: sum is 200 + 200 =400. So exactly 400, so not more than 400. So that's not included.\n\nAnother possibility is one C and one B and one A: 200 +100 +50=350 <400. So that's not included.\n\nAlternatively, what about three B's: 3*100=300 <400.\n\nSo, the combinations that sum >400 are:\n\n- All three C's: 3C.\n\n- Two C's and one A: 2C +1A.\n\n- Two C's and one B: 2C +1B.\n\n- Two C's and one C: but that's three C's, which is the same as the first case.\n\nWait, but I think I need to think differently. Let me approach this by considering the number of C's selected.\n\nCase 1: 3 C's.\n\nNumber of ways: C(4,3) =4.\n\nBut wait, the number of C's available is four, so selecting three: C(4,3)=4.\n\nCase 2: 2 C's and 1 other.\n\nThe other can be any of the remaining 7 candy bars (3A +4B). So the number of ways is C(4,2) * (3 +4).\n\nWait, C(4,2) is the number of ways to choose 2 C's. The third candy can be any of the 7 non-C's.\n\nSo C(4,2) * (3+4) =6 *7=42.\n\nCase 3: 1 C and 2 B's: but wait, that's exactly 400, which isn't more than 400. So we can't include that.\n\nWait, but wait. Are there any other combinations where the sum exceeds 400 without having two or three C's?\n\nFor example, what about 1 C, 1 B, and 1 A: 200 +100 +50=350 <400. So no.\n\nWhat about 1 C and two B's: 200 +200=400, which is not more than 400.\n\nWhat about 1 C and three B's? Wait, but we're selecting three candy bars, so if z=1, then x + y =2.\n\nWait, no, in that case, if I have 1 C, and 2 B's: 1C, 2B.\n\nSum is 200 +200=400 \u2192 not more than 400.\n\nSo that's not counted.\n\nSo the only other case is 2 C's and 1 A or 1 B.\n\nWait, but wait: what about 2 C's and 1 A: 2*200 +50=450>400. That's acceptable.\n\nSo the only combinations that work are when we have at least two C's.\n\nSo the total ways are:\n\nCase 1: 3 C's \u2192 C(4,3)=4.\n\nCase 2: 2 C's and 1 other (either A or B).\n\nNumber of ways: C(4,2) * (3 A's +4 B's) =6 *7=42.\n\nSo total ways:4 +42=46.\n\nSo that matches the earlier calculation.\n\nSo the answer is 46, which is option C.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to select 3 candy bars from a bag containing 11 candy bars such that the total cost exceeds $4 (400 cents).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about selecting candy bars from a bag, and I need to figure out how many ways I can pick three such that their total cost is more than $4. Hmm. Let me try to break it down.\n\nAlright, the bag has 11 candy bars in total. They are divided into three groups based on their cost:\n\n- Three candy bars cost 50 cents each.\n- Four candy bars cost $1 each.\n- Four candy bars cost $2 each.\n\nSo, the first thing I think is that the problem is a combinatorics question. I need to calculate the number of combinations where the sum of the costs of the three selected candy bars exceeds $4.\n\nLet me think about the possible combinations of candy bars. Since the order doesn't matter, it's about how many of each type we pick. So the variables are the number of each type selected: let's say x candy bars of 50 cents, y of $1, and z of $2. And x + y + z = 3, with x, y, z being non-negative integers.\n\nBut wait, the maximum number for each type is limited by the number available. So x can be 0, 1, 2, or 3 (since there are three 50-cent bars). Similarly, y can be 0 up to 4, and z can be 0 up to 4. But since we're only selecting three, some combinations might not be possible.\n\nThe total cost needs to be more than $4. Let's convert everything to cents to avoid confusion. $4 is 400 cents. So the total cost in cents must be more than 400.\n\nSo each candy bar's cost in cents is:\n\n- 50 cents (let's call this A)\n- 100 cents (B)\n- 200 cents (C)\n\nWe need to select 3, so x + y + z = 3. And 50x + 100y + 200z > 400.\n\nLet me list all possible combinations of (x, y, z) that satisfy x + y + z =3, and then check which of these meet the cost condition.\n\nWait, but that might take a while. Maybe a better approach is to find all possible ways to pick three candy bars and subtract those that cost 400 cents or less.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the total number of ways to pick any three, then subtract the number of ways where the total is <=400 cents.\n\nWait, the total number of ways to choose 3 from 11 is C(11,3) = 165. So if I can find the number of ways where the total is <=4, then subtract that from 165, I'll get the answer.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Calculate total ways: 165.\n2. Find the number of ways where the total is <=400 cents.\n3. Subtract that from 165 to get the answer.\n\nBut wait, 400 cents is $4. So total cost must be >$4, which is >400 cents.\n\nSo let's find all possible combinations of x, y, z where x + y + z =3, and 50x +100y +200z <=400.\n\nBut since we're dealing with three candy bars, the maximum possible cost is 3*200 =600 cents. So the other end is 150 cents (3*50). So we're interested in the cases where the sum is between 150 and 400, inclusive. But wait, no, the sum can be anything. Wait, no, wait: the sum can be up to 600. But our condition is sum >400, so sum >=401.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute the number of ways where sum <=400, and subtract that from the total.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of ways where the total cost is <=400.\n\nSo, for each possible combination (x, y, z) where x + y + z =3, check if 50x +100y +200z <=400.\n\nLet me think about possible values of z, since each z contributes 200, which is a lot.\n\nCase 1: z=0.\n\nThen, the cost is 50x +100y. Since z=0, x + y =3.\n\nWe need 50x +100y <=400.\n\nDivide both sides by 50: x + 2y <=8.\n\nBut since x + y =3, substitute x=3-y. So (3 - y) + 2y <=8 \u2192 3 + y <=8 \u2192 y <=5.\n\nBut y can't be more than 3 since x + y=3, so y can be 0,1,2,3.\n\nSo for z=0, all possible (x,y) combinations where x + y=3 will have total cost 50x +100y.\n\nLet's compute the maximum possible cost for z=0: when y=3, x=0: 3*100=300. So 300 <=400, which is true. So all combinations where z=0 are acceptable.\n\nSo number of ways when z=0: number of ways to choose x, y, z with z=0 and x+y=3.\n\nBut wait, the candy bars are of different types. So for each possible (x,y), the number of ways is C(3, x) * C(4, y) * C(4, z), but since z=0, it's C(3, x)*C(4, y).\n\nBut x + y =3.\n\nSo possible (x, y) pairs:\n\n(0,3), (1,2), (2,1), (3,0).\n\nBut we also need to consider the constraints on the number of available candy bars. For example, y can't be more than 4, which it isn't in these cases.\n\nSo compute for each (x, y):\n\n(0,3): x=0, y=3. But wait, there are only 3 A's (50c). So x can't be 3 unless there are three A's. Wait, no, x is the number of A's selected, which can be up to 3. So (0,3) is y=3: but there are 4 B's, so it's possible.\n\nSo for (0,3):\n\nC(3,0)*C(4,3) = 1 * 4 =4.\n\n(1,2): C(3,1)*C(4,2)=3 *6=18.\n\n(2,1): C(3,2)*C(4,1)=3 *4=12.\n\n(3,0): C(3,3)*C(4,0)=1*1=1.\n\nTotal for z=0: 4 +18 +12 +1 =35.\n\nCase 2: z=1.\n\nNow, x + y +1 =3 \u2192 x + y =2.\n\nTotal cost: 50x +100y +200*1 =50x +100y +200.\n\nWe need 50x +100y +200 <=400 \u2192 50x +100y <=200 \u2192 x + 2y <=4.\n\nBut x + y =2.\n\nSo substitute x=2 - y.\n\n(2 - y) + 2y <=4 \u2192 2 + y <=4 \u2192 y <=2.\n\nSo y can be 0,1,2.\n\nSo for each possible (x, y):\n\ny=0 \u2192 x=2.\n\ny=1 \u2192 x=1.\n\ny=2 \u2192 x=0.\n\nNow, check if these are possible.\n\nFor each (x, y):\n\n(2,0): x=2, y=0. Are there enough A's and B's? Yes, since A has 3, B has 4.\n\nNumber of ways: C(3,2)*C(4,0)*C(4,1) =3 *1 *4=12.\n\nWait, wait: when z=1, C(4,1) for the C's.\n\nWait, the formula is C(A, x) * C(B, y) * C(C, z).\n\nSo for (x=2, y=0, z=1):\n\nC(3,2) * C(4,0) * C(4,1) =3 *1 *4=12.\n\n(1,1,1): x=1, y=1, z=1.\n\nC(3,1)*C(4,1)*C(4,1) =3 *4 *4=48.\n\n(0,2,1): x=0, y=2, z=1.\n\nC(3,0)*C(4,2)*C(4,1)=1*6*4=24.\n\nSo adding these up:12 +48 +24 =84.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, let me double-check. The conditions are that the sum 50x +100y +200z <=400. So for z=1, the max x and y are such that x + 2y <=4, with x+y=2.\n\nWait, but in the case of (x=2, y=0, z=1), the cost is 2*50 +0 +200=100 +200=300 \u2264400. So acceptable.\n\nSimilarly, (x=1, y=1, z=1): 50 +100 +200=350 \u2264400. Yes.\n\n(x=0, y=2, z=1): 0 +200 +200=400 \u2192 exactly 400. So this is acceptable.\n\nSo all three cases are allowed.\n\nSo for z=1, the total is 12 +48 +24=84.\n\nCase 3: z=2.\n\nNow, x + y +2 =3 \u2192 x + y =1.\n\nTotal cost:50x +100y +400.\n\nWe need 50x +100y +400 <=400 \u2192 50x +100y <=0 \u2192 x=0 and y=0.\n\nBecause 50x +100y can't be negative, so the only possible solution is x=0, y=0, z=2.\n\nBut x + y =1. So 0 +0=0 !=1. So no solution. Therefore, no possible combinations when z=2.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, x + y =1.\n\nAnd 50x +100y +400 <=400 \u219250x +100y <=0 \u2192 x=0, y=0.\n\nBut x + y must be 1, so that's impossible. So no solutions in this case.\n\nSo z=2 is not possible.\n\nCase 4: z=3.\n\nBut then x + y +3=3 \u2192x + y=0 \u2192 x=0, y=0, z=3.\n\nBut we're only selecting 3 candy bars, so z=3 would require selecting all three from the C's. But the cost would be 3*200=600>400, but in this case, we're considering the case where sum is <=400, so this would not be included. But wait, this is for the sum <=400. So, z=3 would be 600>400, which doesn't satisfy, so it's not counted in the <=400 category.\n\nBut in this case, since x + y=0, the only possibility is (0,0,3). But x + y =0, but when z=3, the cost is 600 which is more than 400. So for the sum <=400, this is not counted.\n\nSo, for z >=2, no solutions.\n\nSo, the only possible z values are 0 and 1.\n\nSo the total number of ways where sum <=400 is 35 (z=0) +84 (z=1) =119.\n\nWait, but wait, let me recount the numbers.\n\nWait, for z=0, I had 35. For z=1, 84. So total is 35 +84=119.\n\nSo the total number of ways where sum >400 is total ways (165) minus 119=46.\n\nSo the answer would be 46, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, for z=0, the number of ways was 35. For z=1, 84. 35+84=119.\n\nTotal ways: 165. 165-119=46. So yes, option C is 46.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miss any cases.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to think about the possible ways where the sum is greater than 400. So let's think about the combinations that would give a sum >400.\n\nEach C candy bar is 200 cents. So if I have two C's, that's 400, plus any other candy bar (even a B, which is 100) would make 500>400. So any combination with two or three C's would automatically satisfy the condition.\n\nWait, but let me think: 2 C's and 1 other: 2*200 + (50 or 100 or 200).\n\nWait, 2 C's plus another C: 3*200=600>400.\n\nBut wait, if I have two C's and one A: 400 +50=450>400. So that's acceptable.\n\nSimilarly, two C's and a B: 400 +100=500>400.\n\nSo, any selection with two or more C's would satisfy the condition.\n\nBut wait, wait, what about three C's? Well, that's 600, which is more than 400. So yes.\n\nBut also, what about one C and two B's: 200 + 2*100=400, which is exactly 400, so not more than 400. So that combination (1C, 2B) is exactly 400, which doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\nSo the combinations that meet the condition are:\n\n1. All three C's: 3C.\n\n2. Two C's and any other candy bar (A, B, or C).\n\n3. One C and two B's: 1C, 2B \u2192 sum is exactly 400 \u2192 not included.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, for one C and two B's: sum is 200 + 200 =400. So exactly 400, so not more than 400. So that's not included.\n\nAnother possibility is one C and one B and one A: 200 +100 +50=350 <400. So that's not included.\n\nAlternatively, what about three B's: 3*100=300 <400.\n\nSo, the combinations that sum >400 are:\n\n- All three C's: 3C.\n\n- Two C's and one A: 2C +1A.\n\n- Two C's and one B: 2C +1B.\n\n- Two C's and one C: but that's three C's, which is the same as the first case.\n\nWait, but I think I need to think differently. Let me approach this by considering the number of C's selected.\n\nCase 1: 3 C's.\n\nNumber of ways: C(4,3) =4.\n\nBut wait, the number of C's available is four, so selecting three: C(4,3)=4.\n\nCase 2: 2 C's and 1 other.\n\nThe other can be any of the remaining 7 candy bars (3A +4B). So the number of ways is C(4,2) * (3 +4).\n\nWait, C(4,2) is the number of ways to choose 2 C's. The third candy can be any of the 7 non-C's.\n\nSo C(4,2) * (3+4) =6 *7=42.\n\nCase 3: 1 C and 2 B's: but wait, that's exactly 400, which isn't more than 400. So we can't include that.\n\nWait, but wait. Are there any other combinations where the sum exceeds 400 without having two or three C's?\n\nFor example, what about 1 C, 1 B, and 1 A: 200 +100 +50=350 <400. So no.\n\nWhat about 1 C and two B's: 200 +200=400, which is not more than 400.\n\nWhat about 1 C and three B's? Wait, but we're selecting three candy bars, so if z=1, then x + y =2.\n\nWait, no, in that case, if I have 1 C, and 2 B's: 1C, 2B.\n\nSum is 200 +200=400 \u2192 not more than 400.\n\nSo that's not counted.\n\nSo the only other case is 2 C's and 1 A or 1 B.\n\nWait, but wait: what about 2 C's and 1 A: 2*200 +50=450>400. That's acceptable.\n\nSo the only combinations that work are when we have at least two C's.\n\nSo the total ways are:\n\nCase 1: 3 C's \u2192 C(4,3)=4.\n\nCase 2: 2 C's and 1 other (either A or B).\n\nNumber of ways: C(4,2) * (3 A's +4 B's) =6 *7=42.\n\nSo total ways:4 +42=46.\n\nSo that matches the earlier calculation.\n\nSo the answer is 46, which is option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to select 3 candy bars from a bag containing 11 candy bars such that the total cost exceeds $4 (400 cents). The candy bars are divided into three groups based on their cost:\n\n- **3 candy bars cost 50 cents each (A)**  \n- **4 candy bars cost $1 each (B)**  \n- **4 candy bars cost $2 each (C)**  \n\n### Key Steps:\n\n1. **Total Number of Ways to Select 3 Candy Bars**:  \n   The total number of ways to select 3 candy bars from 11 is given by the combination formula:  \n   \\[\n   \\binom{11}{3} = 165\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Ways Where Total Cost \u2264 $4 (400 Cents)**:  \n   We consider all possible combinations of candy bars (A, B, C) such that \\(x + y + z = 3\\) and \\(50x + 100y + 200z \\leq 400\\), where \\(x, y, z\\) represent the number of A, B, and C candy bars selected, respectively.  \n\n   - **Case 1: \\(z = 0\\)**  \n     Here, \\(x + y = 3\\), and the total cost is \\(50x + 100y\\). All combinations satisfy \\(50x + 100y \\leq 400\\).  \n     Possible pairs \\((x, y)\\):  \n     \\[\n     (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 0)\n     \\]  \n     Number of ways:  \n     \\[\n     \\binom{3}{0}\\binom{4}{3} + \\binom{3}{1}\\binom{4}{2} + \\binom{3}{2}\\binom{4}{1} + \\binom{3}{3}\\binom{4}{0} = 4 + 18 + 12 + 1 = 35\n     \\]\n\n   - **Case 2: \\(z = 1\\)**  \n     Here, \\(x + y = 2\\), and the total cost is \\(50x + 100y + 200\\). The constraint \\(50x + 100y \\leq 200\\) simplifies to \\(x + 2y \\leq 4\\).  \n     Possible pairs \\((x, y)\\):  \n     \\[\n     (2, 0), (1, 1), (0, 2)\n     \\]  \n     Number of ways:  \n     \\[\n     \\binom{3}{2}\\binom{4}{0}\\binom{4}{1} + \\binom{3}{1}\\binom{4}{1}\\binom{4}{1} + \\binom{3}{0}\\binom{4}{2}\\binom{4}{1} = 12 + 48 + 24 = 84\n     \\]\n\n   - **Case 3: \\(z = 2\\)**  \n     Here, \\(x + y = 1\\), and the total cost is \\(50x + 100y + 400\\). The constraint \\(50x + 100y \\leq 0\\) is impossible since \\(x + y = 1\\). Thus, no valid combinations exist.\n\n   - **Case 4: \\(z = 3\\)**  \n     Here, \\(x + y = 0\\), meaning all 3 candy bars are C. The total cost is \\(600\\) cents, which exceeds $4. However, this case is excluded since we are calculating combinations where the total cost \u2264 $4.\n\n   Total number of ways where the total cost \u2264 $4:  \n   \\[\n   35 + 84 = 119\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Ways Where Total Cost > $4**:  \n   Subtract the number of ways where the total cost \u2264 $4 from the total number of ways:  \n   \\[\n   165 - 119 = 46\n   \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe number of ways to select 3 candy bars such that the total cost exceeds $4 is **46**.\n\nAnswer: C",
