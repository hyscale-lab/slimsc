      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about Fernando's meal plan. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is asking about the number of options he has to allocate his meals. \n\nAlright, so first, the setup. Fernando bought a meal plan that gives him 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. The cafeteria is closed on weekends, so he can't eat there on Saturday or Sunday. Also, he always goes home for dinner on Friday nights. Wait, so that means on Friday dinner, he's not at the cafeteria, right?\n\nLet me think about the days of the week. There are 7 days, but the cafeteria is closed on Saturday and Sunday. So, the days the cafeteria is open are Monday to Friday. That's five days. So he can eat at the cafeteria on those days.\n\nBut wait, he has 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. Since he's only at the cafeteria Monday to Friday, those are the days he can have his meals. Oh, but wait, he goes home for dinner on Friday. So, he can't have dinner at the cafeteria on Friday. So, his dinner for Friday is at home.\n\nWait, so let's clarify. For each day, he can have a meal if the cafeteria is open. Lunches and dinners are separate. So, each day, he can have a lunch and a dinner, except on days when the cafeteria is closed.\n\nWait no, the meal plan is 3 lunches and 3 dinners. So he can choose any 3 days for lunch and 3 days for dinner, but considering the days the cafeteria is open.\n\nWait, but the problem says he goes home for dinner on Friday nights. So, on Friday, he can't have dinner at the cafeteria. So, he must have dinner elsewhere on Friday. So, for dinner, the possible days he can eat at the cafeteria are Monday to Thursday and maybe not Friday. So that's 4 days for dinners.\n\nWait, but he's allowed 3 dinners. So, he has to choose 3 days from the days when the cafeteria is open for dinner. Since Friday's dinner is at home, he can't have it at the cafeteria. So, the possible days for dinner are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. That's 4 days. So he needs to choose 3 of those 4 days to have dinners at the cafeteria.\n\nSimilarly, for lunches, the cafeteria is open Monday to Friday. But wait, does the problem say anything about him going home for lunch on any day? No, it only mentions dinner on Friday. So, he can have lunch on any of the five days: Monday to Friday. He needs to choose 3 days for lunch.\n\nWait, but wait. Oh, wait, the question says the cafeteria is closed on weekends, so he can't eat there. So, for both lunch and dinner, the available days are Monday to Friday. But for dinner, Friday is off because he goes home. So, for dinner, only 4 days are available (Mon-Thu) to choose 3 dinners.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose lunch days is the number of ways to choose 3 days from 5 (Mon-Fri) for lunch. That would be 5 choose 3, which is 5C3.\n\nFor dinners, since he can't have dinner on Friday, he has to choose 3 days from the remaining 4 days (Mon-Thu). So that's 4 choose 3, which is 4C3.\n\nWait, so the total number of options would be the product of these two choices: (5C3) multiplied by (4C3).\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 5C3 * 4C3. So that's the one.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Another way to think about it: For each meal type, determine the number of possible days.\n\nLunch: 5 days (Mon-Fri). Choose 3. So 5C3.\n\nDinner: Only 4 days (Mon-Thu) available because Friday is off. Choose 3. 4C3.\n\nMultiply them together: 5C3 *4C3.\n\nYes, that's option A.\n",

Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nFernando has a meal plan that allows him 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. The cafeteria is closed on weekends, which means it's not open on Saturday and Sunday. And he always goes home for dinner on Friday nights. Hmm, so I need to figure out how many ways he can allocate his meals given these constraints.\n\nWait, let's break this down. First, the week structure. The cafeteria is closed on weekends, so that's Saturday and Sunday. That leaves us with Monday to Friday as the days when the cafeteria is open. So that's 5 days in total.\n\nHe needs to use his meal plan for these days. But wait, he can't go to the cafeteria on Saturday and Sunday because it's closed, so he has to use his meals on the other days.\n\nHe has 3 lunches and 3 dinners. Let me think about each separately.\n\nFor lunches: He has 5 days (Mon-Fri) where he can have lunch. He can choose any 3 of those days to have a cafeteria lunch. So the number of ways to choose 3 days out of 5 for lunch is the combination 5 choose 3, which is 5C3.\n\nWait, but wait. Are there any constraints on the dinners? Oh, right! He always goes home for dinner on Friday nights. So that means he can't have dinner on Friday. So for dinners, he has to choose 3 days from the days when he can eat dinner, which are the days the cafeteria is open except Friday.\n\nWait, so the days available for dinner are Monday to Thursday, which is 4 days. Because Friday is taken care of by him going home. So for dinners, he can choose any 3 days out of these 4. So the number of ways is 4 choose 3, which is 4C3.\n\nSo the total number of options is the product of the two combinations. So 5C3 multiplied by 4C3.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A is 5C3 *4C3. That's exactly what I got. \n\nOther options: Let me quickly check others to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nOption B: 5C4 *4C2. Hmm, 5C4 is 5, and 4C2 is 6. But I don't think that's right because we need 3 dinners, not 2.\n\nOption C: 5C2 *4C4. 5C2 is 10, 4C4 is 1. So that would give 10 options, which is way less than what I think.\n\nOption D: 5C6 *4C5. Wait, 5C6 isn't possible because you can't choose 6 items from 5. That's zero. So D is wrong.\n\nOption E: 4C3 *4C3. So that's 4 *4=16. But wait, no, because for lunch he has 5C3, not 4C3. So E is wrong.\n\nSo the correct answer should be A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Fernando and his meal plan. Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nFernando has a meal plan that allows him 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. The cafeteria is closed on weekends, which means it's not open on Saturday and Sunday. And he always goes home for dinner on Friday nights. Hmm, so I need to figure out how many ways he can allocate his meals given these constraints.\n\nWait, let's break this down. First, the week structure. The cafeteria is closed on weekends, so that's Saturday and Sunday. That leaves us with Monday to Friday as the days when the cafeteria is open. So that's 5 days in total.\n\nHe needs to use his meal plan for these days. But wait, he can't go to the cafeteria on Saturday and Sunday because it's closed, so he has to use his meals on the other days.\n\nHe has 3 lunches and 3 dinners. Let me think about each separately.\n\nFor lunches: He has 5 days (Mon-Fri) where he can have lunch. He can choose any 3 of those days to have a cafeteria lunch. So the number of ways to choose 3 days out of 5 for lunch is the combination 5 choose 3, which is 5C3.\n\nWait, but wait. Are there any constraints on the dinners? Oh, right! He always goes home for dinner on Friday nights. So that means he can't have dinner on Friday. So for dinners, he has to choose 3 days from the days when he can eat dinner, which are the days the cafeteria is open except Friday.\n\nWait, so the days available for dinner are Monday to Thursday, which is 4 days. Because Friday is taken care of by him going home. So for dinners, he can choose any 3 days out of these 4. So the number of ways is 4 choose 3, which is 4C3.\n\nSo the total number of options is the product of the two combinations. So 5C3 multiplied by 4C3.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A is 5C3 *4C3. That's exactly what I got. \n\nOther options: Let me quickly check others to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nOption B: 5C4 *4C2. Hmm, 5C4 is 5, and 4C2 is 6. But I don't think that's right because we need 3 dinners, not 2.\n\nOption C: 5C2 *4C4. 5C2 is 10, 4C4 is 1. So that would give 10 options, which is way less than what I think.\n\nOption D: 5C6 *4C5. Wait, 5C6 isn't possible because you can't choose 6 items from 5. That's zero. So D is wrong.\n\nOption E: 4C3 *4C3. So that's 4 *4=16. But wait, no, because for lunch he has 5C3, not 4C3. So E is wrong.\n\nSo the correct answer should be A.\n\n\nFernando has a meal plan that allows him 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. The cafeteria is closed on weekends, leaving only Monday to Friday (5 days) when he can use his meal plan. For lunches, he can choose any 3 days out of these 5, which corresponds to the combination \\(5C3\\). \n\nFor dinners, he always goes home on Friday nights, meaning he cannot use the cafeteria on Friday. Therefore, he must choose 3 days for dinners from the remaining 4 days (Monday to Thursday), which corresponds to the combination \\(4C3\\). \n\nThe total number of ways to allocate his meals is the product of these two combinations: \\(5C3 \\times 4C3\\). \n\nAnalyzing the options:\n- **Option A** (\\(5C3 \\times 4C3\\)) matches the correct calculation.\n- **Option B** (\\(5C4 \\times 4C2\\)) is incorrect because it uses the wrong number of days for both lunch and dinner.\n- **Option C** (\\(5C2 \\times 4C4\\)) is incorrect because it underestimates the number of lunch and dinner options.\n- **Option D** (\\(5C6 \\times 4C5\\)) is invalid since \\(5C6\\) is not possible.\n- **Option E** (\\(4C3 \\times 4C3\\)) is incorrect because it uses the wrong number of days for lunches.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",

The cafeteria is closed on weekends, so that probably means he can't use it on Saturday and Sunday. Also, he always goes home for dinner on Fridays. I need to figure out how many options he has to allocate his meals.\n\nHmm. So let me break this down. The week has 7 days, right? But the cafeteria is closed on weekends. So that leaves Monday to Friday as days when the cafeteria is open. So that's 5 days where he can get his meals.\n\nWait, but he has to use 3 lunches and 3 dinners. Oh wait, but he's purchasing a meal plan that allows him 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. So he has to choose 3 days for lunch and 3 days for dinner from the days the cafeteria is open.\n\nWait, but he can't use the cafeteria on weekends, so he can't have lunch or dinner on Saturday or Sunday. So his options for meals are only from Monday to Friday.\n\nBut wait, he always goes home for dinner on Friday. So that means he can't have dinner at the cafeteria on Friday. So his dinner on Friday is at home, so he can't use one of his dinner meals on Friday. So how does that affect his meal allocation?\n\nLet me think. He has 3 dinners to allocate. But one of them must be at home on Friday. So the other two dinners must be on the other days when the cafeteria is open, which are Monday to Thursday. So for dinners, he must choose 2 days from the 4 days (Mon-Thu) because Friday is already taken care of (he goes home). \n\nWait, wait. Wait, no, because he has 3 dinners in total. So if Friday is fixed as one dinner (at home), he has to choose the other two dinners from the remaining four days (Monday to Thursday). So for dinners, the number of options is choosing 2 days out of 4. So that would be 4 choose 2, which is 4C2.\n\nThen, for the lunches. He has 3 lunches to allocate over the 5 days (Mon-Fri). Because he can have lunch on any day, right? Because he only goes home for dinner on Friday, not lunch. So he can have lunch on any of the 5 days. So he needs to choose 3 days out of 5 for lunch. So that would be 5 choose 3, which is 5C3.\n\nSo the total number of options is the product of the two: 5C3 multiplied by 4C2.\n\nWait, looking at the options, option B is 5C4 *4C2. Wait, no, option B is 5C4 multiplied by 4C2. Wait, 5C4 is 5 choose 4, which is 5. 4C2 is 6. So 5*6=30. But wait, my calculation was 5C3 *4C2. 5C3 is 10, 4C2 is 6, so 60. But none of the options have that. Wait, looking back at the options:\n\nOptions:\nA)5C3 *4C3 \u2192 10 *4=40\nB)5C4 *4C2 \u21925*6=30\nC)5C2 *4C4 \u219210*1=10\nD)5C6 *4C5 \u2192 which would be zero because you can't choose 6 from 5, same for 5 from 4.\nE)4C3 *4C3 \u21924*4=16.\n\nWait, my calculation was 5C3 *4C2 =10 *6=60. But none of the options have 60. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the number of days available for each meal. Let me re-examine.\n\nHe can't have meals on weekends, so only Mon-Fri (5 days). He must have 3 lunches and 3 dinners.\n\nBut he goes home for dinner on Friday. So for dinner, he can't use Friday. So he needs to choose 3 dinners from the other four days (Mon-Thu). Wait, wait, that can't be. Because he has 3 dinners, but Friday is not available. So he must choose 3 dinners from Mon-Thu, which is four days. So 4 choose 3, which is 4C3=4.\n\nAnd for lunch, he can choose any 3 days from the 5 days (Mon-Fri). So 5C3=10.\n\nSo the total would be 5C3 *4C3=10*4=40. Which is option A.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with my previous thought. So earlier I thought he has to choose 2 dinners, but that's incorrect. Because he's using 3 dinners, but Friday is excluded, so all three dinners are on Mon-Thu, which are 4 days. So it's 4 choose 3.\n\nAh, right! So for dinners, he needs to pick 3 days from the 4 available (Mon-Thu). So 4C3.\n\nAnd for lunch, 3 days from 5 (Mon-Fri), so 5C3.\n\nThus, the total is 5C3 *4C3 =10 *4=40. So option A is 5C3 *4C3, which is correct.\n\nWait, why did I get confused earlier? Oh, because I thought he can't have dinner on Friday, so the other two dinners are on Mon-Thu. But that would be only if he was only having two dinners elsewhere. But no, he's having three dinners, each on different days. But since Friday is already taken for home dinner, the other three must be on Mon-Thu. So 4 days, choose 3. So 4C3.\n\nSo the correct calculation is 5C3 *4C3, which is option A.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Fernando and his meal plan. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.\n\nFernando bought a meal plan that gives him 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. The cafeteria is closed on weekends, so he can't eat there on Saturday or Sunday. Also, he always goes home for dinner on Friday nights. The question is asking how many options he has to allocate his meals. The options are given as A to E, each involving combinations like 5C3, 4C3, etc.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. So, the main points are:\n\n- Meal plan: 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week.\n- Cafeteria closed on weekends (Saturday and Sunday).\n- He goes home for dinner on Friday nights.\n\nWait, so he can't eat at the cafeteria on weekends. That means he can only eat there during the weekdays: Monday to Friday.\n\nBut wait, he's getting 3 dinners, but one of them is Friday night when he goes home. So, he can't eat at the cafeteria on Friday for dinner either, because he's going home. So, the three dinners he uses must be on the other days when he's at school.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. He goes home for dinner on Friday nights. So, he doesn't eat at the cafeteria on Friday for dinner. So his three dinners must be on the other days when the cafeteria is open.\n\nWait, the cafeteria is closed on weekends, but the question is about allocating his meals. So, he can only use the meal plan on the days the cafeteria is open. So, the days when he can use the meal plan are Monday to Friday for both lunch and dinner, except for Friday dinner when he's at home.\n\nSo, let me map out the days:\n\n- Monday to Thursday: both lunch and dinner available.\n- Friday: lunch available, dinner not at cafeteria (he goes home).\n- Saturday and Sunday: both closed.\n\nSo, he needs to allocate 3 lunches and 3 dinners, but the dinners can't be on Friday. So, for dinners, he can only choose from Monday to Thursday. Because on Friday, he's at home.\n\nWait, but how about the rest of the days? Let me count the available days for each meal.\n\nFor lunch: He can have it on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Because the cafeteria is open for lunch on Friday. Wait, the problem says he goes home for dinner on Friday nights, but nothing about lunch. So, he can have lunch on Friday.\n\nSo, for lunch, possible days are Monday-Friday (5 days).\n\nFor dinner: he can't eat at the cafeteria on Friday or weekends. So, the only available dinners are Monday to Thursday (4 days).\n\nSo, he needs to choose 3 days out of the 5 for lunch, and 3 days out of the 4 for dinner.\n\nWait, but the problem says the meal plan allows a total of 3 lunches and 3 dinners. So, he needs to choose 3 days for lunch (each day he can have one lunch), and 3 days for dinner, each day one dinner.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose the days is the combination of 5 choose 3 for lunches, multiplied by 4 choose 3 for dinners.\n\nSo, the calculation would be 5C3 * 4C3.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 5C3 * 4C3. So, that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's think again.\n\nHe can have lunch on any of the 5 days (Mon-Fri) because the cafeteria is closed only on weekends. But dinner is different because on Friday, he goes home. So, he can have dinner on Mon-Thu (4 days).\n\nSo, he needs to pick 3 days for lunch from 5, and 3 days for dinner from 4.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Fernando and his meal plan. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.\n\nFernando bought a meal plan that gives him 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. The cafeteria is closed on weekends, so he can't eat there on Saturday or Sunday. Also, he always goes home for dinner on Friday nights. The question is asking how many options he has to allocate his meals. The options are given as A to E, each involving combinations like 5C3, 4C3, etc.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. So, the main points are:\n\n- Meal plan: 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week.\n- Cafeteria closed on weekends (Saturday and Sunday).\n- He goes home for dinner on Friday nights.\n\nWait, so he can't eat at the cafeteria on weekends. That means he can only eat there during the weekdays: Monday to Friday.\n\nBut wait, he's getting 3 dinners, but one of them is Friday night when he goes home. So, he can't eat at the cafeteria on Friday for dinner either, because he's going home. So, the three dinners he uses must be on the other days when he's at school.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. He goes home for dinner on Friday nights. So, he doesn't eat at the cafeteria on Friday for dinner. So his three dinners must be on the other days when the cafeteria is open.\n\nWait, the cafeteria is closed on weekends, but the question is about allocating his meals. So, he can only use the meal plan on the days the cafeteria is open. So, the days when he can use the meal plan are Monday to Friday for both lunch and dinner, except for Friday dinner when he's at home.\n\nSo, let me map out the days:\n\n- Monday to Thursday: both lunch and dinner available.\n- Friday: lunch available, dinner not at cafeteria (he goes home).\n- Saturday and Sunday: both closed.\n\nSo, he needs to allocate 3 lunches and 3 dinners, but the dinners can't be on Friday. So, for dinners, he can only choose from Monday to Thursday. Because on Friday, he's at home.\n\nWait, but how about the rest of the days? Let me count the available days for each meal.\n\nFor lunch: He can have it on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Because the cafeteria is open for lunch on Friday. Wait, the problem says he goes home for dinner on Friday nights, but nothing about lunch. So, he can have lunch on Friday.\n\nSo, for lunch, possible days are Monday-Friday (5 days).\n\nFor dinner: he can't eat at the cafeteria on Friday or weekends. So, the only available dinners are Monday to Thursday (4 days).\n\nSo, he needs to choose 3 days out of the 5 for lunch, and 3 days out of the 4 for dinner.\n\nWait, but the problem says the meal plan allows a total of 3 lunches and 3 dinners. So, he needs to choose 3 days for lunch (each day he can have one lunch), and 3 days for dinner, each day one dinner.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose the days is the combination of 5 choose 3 for lunches, multiplied by 4 choose 3 for dinners.\n\nSo, the calculation would be 5C3 * 4C3.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 5C3 * 4C3.

Let me read it again.\n\nFernando has a meal plan that allows 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. The cafeteria is closed on weekends, which I assume means Saturday and Sunday. He always goes home for dinner on Friday nights. Hmm, so I need to figure out how many ways he can allocate his meals under these constraints.\n\nWait, the problem is about combinations, right? So it's a combinatorics question. I think I need to find the number of ways he can choose his lunch and dinner days, considering the days the cafeteria is open.\n\nLet me think about the days of the week. So, the week has 7 days, but the cafeteria is closed on weekends, which are Saturday and Sunday. So, the days the cafeteria is open are Monday to Friday. That's 5 days.\n\nWait, but he goes home for dinner on Friday nights. So, on Friday, he can't have dinner at the cafeteria. So, does that affect how he uses his dinner meals? Let's see.\n\nSo, he has 3 dinners per week, but since he goes home on Friday, he can't use the dinner slot on Friday. So, he has to use his dinners on the other four days: Monday to Thursday. Wait, no, wait. The days when the cafeteria is open are Monday to Friday. But on Friday, he can't eat dinner there because he's going home. So, the possible days for dinners are Monday to Thursday, which is 4 days. Oh wait, that's 4 days. So he has to choose 3 dinners from those 4 days.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. The meal plan allows 3 dinners. But he can't eat at the cafeteria on Friday for dinner. So, he can have dinners on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday? No, wait, because on Friday he's going home, so he can't have dinner at the cafeteria. So the days available for dinner are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. So 4 days.\n\nSo for dinner, he needs to choose 3 days out of these 4. So the number of ways for dinners is 4 choose 3, which is 4C3.\n\nNow, for lunches. He has 3 lunches to allocate. The cafeteria is open on Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So he can choose any 3 days out of these 5 for his lunches. So the number of ways for lunches is 5 choose 3, which is 5C3.\n\nSo the total number of options is the product of the two, right? Because for each way of choosing dinners, there are multiple ways to choose lunches. So the total is 5C3 multiplied by 4C3.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 5C3 * 4C3. So that's the one.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't get confused between the days. So, the key points:\n\n- 3 dinners, but can't use Friday.\n- So dinners are chosen from 4 days (Mon-Thu).\n- Lunches are chosen from 5 days (Mon-Fri), since Friday is open for lunch.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So for lunch, 5 days, choose 3. For dinner, 4 days, choose 3.\n\nSo the total is 5C3 * 4C3, which is option A.\n",
