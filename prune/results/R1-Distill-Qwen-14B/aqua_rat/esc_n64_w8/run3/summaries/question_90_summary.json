      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a book being sold with a certain profit and then a lower price, and I need to find out if it's a profit or loss and what percentage it is. Hmm, let's see.\n\nAlright, the book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a 10% profit. I think I should find the cost price first because without knowing that, I can't calculate the profit or loss when the price changes.\n\nWait, right. Profit is calculated on the cost price. So if selling price is 27.50 and profit is 10%, the formula for selling price is cost price plus 10% of cost price. So selling price = cost price * (1 + profit%). \n\nSo mathematically, 27.50 = CP * 1.10. To find CP, I'll divide 27.50 by 1.10. Let me calculate that: 27.50 divided by 1.1. Hmm, 1.1 times 25 is 27.5, right? Because 25 * 1.1 is 27.5. So the cost price is Rs 25. \n\nWait, wait, let me double-check that. 25 times 1.1 is 25 + 2.5 = 27.5. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the cost price (CP) is Rs 25. Now, if the book is sold for Rs 25.75, I need to find whether this is a profit or loss and the percentage.\n\nWait a minute, wait. Because 25.75 is less than the original selling price of 27.50, but how does that compare to the cost price of 25? Let me compute the new selling price compared to CP.\n\nSo the new selling price is 25.75. The cost price is 25. So the profit or loss is 25.75 -25 = 0.75. Oh wait, 0.75 is a profit because the selling price is higher than cost price.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, 25.75 is higher than 25? No, wait, 25.75 is 25 and 75 paisa. Oh wait, wait, wait. No, 25.75 is 25 plus 0.75, which is 25.75. So the selling price is higher than cost price by 0.75. So that's a profit of 0.75.\n\nWait, but wait, in the first case, the selling price was 27.50, which is higher than CP of 25. So when the selling price is 25.75, which is still higher than 25, so profit again. Hmm, that's different than I thought.\n\nWait, but wait, the options don't have a profit, except options A and B. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, wait. Oh wait, I'm getting confused. Let me redo the calculations.\n\nOriginal cost price (CP) is 25. If the new selling price (SP) is 25.75, then the profit is SP - CP = 25.75 -25 = 0.75 Rs. So profit is 0.75 on CP of 25. To find the percentage profit, it's (profit / CP) * 100.\n\nSo (0.75 / 25) * 100. Let's compute 0.75 divided by 25. 0.75 \u00f725 is 0.03. 0.03 times 100 is 3%. So that's a 3% profit.\n\nWait, but wait, the options are A)2% Profit, B)3% Profit, etc. So the answer would be B)3% Profit. But that's not possible because the new SP is 25.75, which is higher than CP. Oh wait, no, because CP is 25, and SP is 25.75, so it's a profit. So why is that the options have loss options as well?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check. Wait, wait, wait. No, wait. The first time, the selling price was 27.50, which is higher than CP of 25, leading to a 10% profit. Now, when the SP is 25.75, which is still higher than 25, so it's a profit, but less than 10%. So 3% profit.\n\nWait, but the options include a 3% loss option, which is D. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in calculation?\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the problem statement. Oh wait, wait a second. Did I get the numbers right? The problem says when the book was sold for 27.50, the profit was 10%. So CP is 25. Now, if it were sold for 25.75, then what is the profit or loss percentage.\n\nWait, 25.75 is more than 25, so it's a profit. So the profit is 0.75. So 0.75 /25 = 0.03, which is 3% profit. So the answer would be option B, 3% profit. But looking at the options, option B is 3% profit, so that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't mess up the numbers. So the original selling price is 27.50, which is 10% profit over 25. So 25 * 1.1 is 27.50. Correct.\n\nNow, when SP is 25.75, which is 25.75 -25 = 0.75 profit. So 0.75 is 3% of 25. So 3% profit. So the correct answer is B)3% Profit.\n\nWait, but looking back, the problem says, \"then would have been percentage of profit and loss?\" Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Oh wait, no, if the SP is 25.75, which is higher than CP, so it's a profit. So why are the options including loss options? Maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me read again: the book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a 10% profit. If it were sold for Rs 25.75, then what would be the percentage of profit or loss?\n\nWait, so when it's sold for 25.75, compared to cost price of 25, that's a profit of 0.75, which is 3% of 25. So profit of 3%, which is option B. So that's the answer.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we first determine the cost price (CP) of the book. The book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a 10% profit.

Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step.\n\nAlright, the first part says the book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%. I remember that profit percentage is calculated based on the cost price. So, maybe I should find the cost price first.\n\nWait, the formula for profit percentage is (Profit / Cost Price) * 100. Profit is Selling Price minus Cost Price. Oh right, so Profit = Selling Price - Cost. And since Profit is 10% of Cost, that equation would be:\n\nProfit = 0.10 * Cost.\n\nBut the Selling Price is given as 27.50, which is equal to Cost + Profit. So, 27.50 = Cost + (0.10 * Cost) which simplifies to 27.50 = 1.10 * Cost.\n\nSo to find the Cost Price, I can divide 27.50 by 1.10. Let me do that: 27.50 / 1.10 equals... let's see, 27.5 divided by 1.1. Hmm, 1.1 times 25 is 27.5, right? Because 1.1 times 20 is 22, plus 1.1 times 5 is 5.5, so 22 +5.5=27.5. So the cost price is 25 Rs.\n\nGot it, the cost is 25 Rs. Now, the second part of the question says if it were sold for Rs 25.75, what would be the profit or loss percentage.\n\nSo, new selling price is 25.75. Let's compare this to the cost price. The cost is 25, so selling for 25.75 is higher than cost? Wait, 25.75 is more than 25, so that would be a profit, right? Wait, no, wait a second. Let me think again. 25.75 is 25 and 3/4, which is 25.75. The cost is 25. So 25.75 minus 25 is 0.75. So profit is 0.75 Rs.\n\nWait, wait no. Wait, 25.75 is less than 27.50 but more than 25? No, wait, 25.75 is more than 25, so profit is positive. So in that case, profit is 0.75 Rs.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check. If the cost is 25, and the selling price is 25.75, then selling price is higher than cost, so profit. So profit is 25.75 -25 = 0.75.\n\nSo the profit is 0.75. Now, to find the percentage profit, I use the formula (Profit / Cost) * 100. So (0.75 /25)*100.\n\nHmm, 0.75 divided by 25 is... Let me calculate that. 0.75 /25 = 0.03. Multiply by 100 gives 3%.\n\nWait, so the profit is 3%? But wait, the options are about profit or loss. So, if the profit is 3%, then the answer would be a 3% profit. But wait, looking at the options, option B is 3% profit, and option D is 3% loss.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations. Because if the cost is 25, and the selling price is 25.75, that's a 0.75 increase. 0.75 is 3% of 25 because 25 *0.03 is 0.75. So yes, 3% profit.\n\nWait, but the options are A) 2% profit, B)3% profit, C)2% loss, D)3% loss, E)4% loss.\n\nSo according to this, the answer should be B)3% profit.\n\nWait a minute, but wait. Let me think again. Because sometimes, people can confuse the selling price when it's a loss. But in this case, since 25.75 is higher than 25, it's a profit.\n\nWait, but wait the problem says \"would have been percentage of profit and loss.\" Oh, maybe I misread the second part. Let me read the question again.\n\n\"If it were sold for Rs. 25.75, then would have been percentage of profit and loss?\"\n\nWait, so the selling price is 25.75. So, compared to cost, is it a profit or loss? If cost is 25, 25.75 is higher, so profit.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the cost. Let me recheck that part.\n\nThe first part says sold for 27.50 with 10% profit. So, selling price = cost + 10% of cost. So 1.10 * cost = 27.50. So cost is 27.50 / 1.10 = 25. Correct.\n\nSo the cost is 25, selling at 25.75. So profit is 0.75, which is 3% of 25. So the answer should be 3% profit, option B.\n\nBut wait, the options are given as A to E, and I'm looking at the options again.\n\nOption B is 3% profit. So that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Because 25.75 is 25 plus 0.75, so profit is 0.75. So 0.75 is 3% of 25.\n\nYes, so that's correct. So the answer is option B.\n",

So that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Because 25.75 is 25 plus 0.75, so profit is 0.75. So 0.75 is 3% of 25.\n\nYes, so that's correct. So the answer is option B.\n\n\nThe book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%. To find the cost price, we use the formula for profit percentage:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Selling Price} = \\text{Cost Price} + \\text{Profit}\n\\]  \n\\[\n\\text{Selling Price} = \\text{Cost Price} + 0.10 \\times \\text{Cost Price}\n\\]  \n\\[\n\\text{Selling Price} = 1.10 \\times \\text{Cost Price}\n\\]  \nGiven the selling price is Rs 27.50, we solve for the cost price:  \n\\[\n27.50 = 1.10 \\times \\text{Cost Price}\n\\]  \n\\[\n\\text{Cost Price} = \\frac{27.50}{1.10} = 25 \\, \\text{Rs}.\n\\]  \n\nNow, if the book were sold for Rs 25.75, the profit or loss is calculated as follows:  \n\\[\n\\text{Profit} = \\text{Selling Price} - \\text{Cost Price} = 25.75 - 25 = 0.75 \\, \\text{Rs}.\n\\]  \nThe profit percentage is then:  \n\\[\n\\text{Profit Percentage} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Profit}}{\\text{Cost Price}}\\right) \\times 100 = \\left(\\frac{0.75}{25}\\right) \\times 100 = 3\\%.\n\\]  \n\nSince the selling price (Rs 25.75) is greater than the cost price (Rs 25), this results in a profit. Therefore, the correct answer is **3% Profit**.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a book being sold and profit percentages. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nThe question says that a book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%. Then, if it were sold for Rs 25.75, what would be the percentage of profit or loss? The options are A to E, with some profit and loss percentages.\n\nFirst, I think I need to find the cost price of the book because that's the starting point. Once I have the cost price, I can compare the selling prices to find out whether there's a profit or loss in the second scenario.\n\nSo, when the book is sold for Rs 27.50 with a 10% profit, that means the selling price is 110% of the cost price. Let me write that down as an equation.\n\nLet me denote the cost price as CP. So, the selling price (SP) when there's a 10% profit is:\nSP = CP + 10% of CP\nWhich is the same as SP = 1.10 * CP.\n\nWe know the SP is 27.50, so:\n27.50 = 1.10 * CP\nTo find CP, I can divide both sides by 1.10.\n\nCP = 27.50 / 1.10\nHmm, let me calculate that. 27.50 divided by 1.10. Let's see, 1.10 times 25 is 27.5 because 25 * 1 =25, 25 *0.10=2.5, so 25+2.5=27.5. So CP is 25.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the cost price is Rs 25.\n\nNow, the second part is when the book is sold for Rs 25.75. I need to find the profit or loss percentage in this case.\n\nSo, the new selling price (SP2) is 25.75, and the cost price is still 25. So I can compare SP2 to CP to see if it's a profit or loss.\n\nLet me calculate the difference. SP2 is 25.75 and CP is 25, so the difference is 25.75 -25 = 0.75. Since SP2 is higher than CP, that means there's a profit of 0.75.\n\nWait, wait a second. No, wait. 25.75 is more than 25, so yes, it's a profit. Wait, no, wait another second. No, wait. 25.75 is less than 27.50, but more than 25. So in the first case, it was sold for 27.50 with 10% profit. Now, it's sold for 25.75, which is between cost price and the original selling price. So it's still a profit, but a smaller one.\n\nWait, no, no. Wait, 25.75 is higher than the cost price of 25, so yes, profit. So the profit amount is 0.75.\n\nTo find the percentage profit, I think the formula is (Profit / Cost Price) * 100. So profit is 0.75, CP is 25.\n\nSo percentage profit = (0.75 / 25) * 100.\n\nLet me compute that. 0.75 divided by 25 is 0.03. Multiply by 100 gives 3%. So the profit is 3%.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is 3% profit. But wait, the question says if it were sold for 25.75, then what would be the profit or loss. So in this case, the selling price is higher than cost, so profit. So the percentage is 3% profit, which would be option B.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, the cost price is 25. Selling price is 25.75. So the profit is 0.75. 0.75 /25 is 0.03, which is 3% profit. So the answer should be B)3% Profit.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options, option B is 3% profit, and option D is 3% loss. So according to my calculation, the answer is B.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when the SP is lower than the original selling price, maybe some think it's a loss. But no, the cost is 25. So any SP above 25 is profit, below is loss.\n\nSo in this case, 25.75 is above 25, so profit. So the profit is 3%.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again:\n\nA)2% Profit\nB)3% Profit\nC)2% Loss\nD)3% Loss\nE)4% Loss\n\nSo yes, option B is 3% profit.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about profit and loss. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says that a book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%. Then it asks, if it were sold for Rs 25.75, what would be the percentage of profit or loss? The options are A to E, with some profit and loss percentages.\n\nHmm, right. I remember that profit percentage is calculated based on the cost price. So first, I think I need to find the cost price of the book. Once I have that, I can figure out the profit or loss when it's sold at the lower price.\n\nAlright, let's start with the first part. The book was sold for Rs 27.50 at a 10% profit. So, the selling price is 110% of the cost price. Because 10% profit means you add 10% of the cost to itself. So, mathematically, Selling Price = Cost Price + 10% of Cost Price. Or, SP = CP * (1 + 10/100) = CP * 1.1.\n\nWe know the SP is 27.50. So, 27.50 = CP * 1.1. To find CP, I can rearrange this equation: CP = 27.50 / 1.1.\n\nLet me calculate that. 27.50 divided by 1.1. Hmm, 27.5 divided by 1.1. Well, 1.1 times 25 is 27.5 because 25 * 1 =25, 25 *0.1=2.5, 25+2.5=27.5. Oh, so 1.1 *25=27.5. So CP is 25. So the cost price is Rs 25.\n\nNow, the second part of the question says the book was sold for Rs 25.75. I need to find whether there's a profit or loss and what the percentage is.\n\nWait, the cost price is 25. The selling price is 25.75. So SP is 25.75, CP is 25. So SP is higher than CP, right? Wait, no, wait. 25.75 is more than 25, so that would be a profit, right?\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, if I sold it for 25.75, which is higher than the cost of 25, that's a profit. But let me double-check. Wait, no, wait. Because 25.75 is more than 25, so profit is 25.75 -25= 0.75. So profit is 0.75 Rs.\n\nBut wait, I thought the options had loss as an option. Oh, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no. Because in the second scenario, the selling price is 25.75, which is higher than the cost price of 25. So that's a profit. So the profit would be 0.75. So the profit percentage is (0.75 / 25) * 100.\n\nWait, but wait, wait. The question says, if it were sold for 25.75, what would be the profit or loss? Oh, but wait, 25.75 is higher than the cost price of 25, so profit.\n\nWait, but let me check the numbers again. Wait, the cost price is 25, and the selling price is 25.75. So yes, profit of 0.75.\n\nBut wait, the options don't have a 3% profit. Wait, let me calculate the percentage. 0.75 divided by 25 is 0.03. So 3%, so 3% profit. So the answer would be option B. But wait, looking back at the options:\n\nOptions are:\n\nA) 2% Profit\n\nB)3% Profit\n\nC)2% Loss\n\nD)3% Loss\n\nE)4% Loss\n\nWait, but I thought the second selling price was 25.75, which is higher than CP, so profit. So the answer would be option B: 3% Profit.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Did I make a mistake? Because the initial selling price was 27.50, which is higher than 25.75. So when the selling price goes down, the profit would be lower. Oh wait, no, in the second scenario, selling price is 25.75, which is higher than the cost price of 25, so profit. So yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but wait again. Wait, no. Because the second selling price is 25.75. Wait, 25.75 is higher than 25, so profit. So the profit is 0.75, which is 3% of 25. So the percentage is 3% profit. So option B is correct.\n\nWait, but wait. Oh wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.\n\nCP is 25, SP is 25.75. So profit is 25.75 -25 = 0.75.\n\nProfit percentage is (Profit / CP) *100 = (0.75/25)*100 = 3%.\n\nSo the answer would be B: 3% Profit.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, I see that the options include a 3% loss as D. So I must be careful. Wait, no, because in this case, SP is higher than CP, so it's a profit. So the correct option is B.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Wait, no, wait. Oh, no! Wait a minute, I think I'm making a mistake here. Because in the first scenario, the selling price is 27.50, which is higher than 25. So that's a profit.\n\nIn the second scenario, the selling price is 25.75, which is also higher than 25. So that's also a profit. So why are there options for loss? Did I misunderstand the question?\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the cost price. Let me double-check.\n\nThe first part: sold for Rs 27.50 with a 10% profit. So SP = CP + 10% of CP.\n\nSo SP = 1.1 * CP. So CP = SP / 1.1 = 27.50 /1.1.\n\nWhat is 27.50 divided by 1.1?\n\nWell, 1.1 multiplied by 25 is 27.50 because 25 *1.1 =25 +2.5=27.5.\n\nSo CP is 25, correct.\n\nSecond part: sold for 25.75.\n\nSo SP is 25.75, which is 25 +0.75. So that's 0.75 over CP. So profit is 0.75.\n\nSo profit percentage is (0.75 /25)*100 = 3%.\n\nSo the answer would be option B:3% Profit.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, I see option D is 3% Loss. So why is that? Did I make a mistake in interpreting the question?\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the second selling price. Let me check. The question says, if it were sold for 25.75, then would have been percentage of profit and loss?\n\nWait, 25.75 is less than 27.50, the original selling price. But the cost price is 25. So 25.75 is higher than cost, so profit.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking what if it was sold for 25.75, which is lower than the original SP, but higher than the CP, so profit.\n\nSo the correct answer should be 3% profit, option B.\n\nWait, but the options are: A)2% Profit, B)3% Profit, C)2% Loss, D)3% Loss, E)4% Loss.\n\nSo the correct answer would be B.\n\nBut wait, looking again at the problem statement, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me read it again.\n\nWait, the first part says sold for Rs27.50 with a 10% profit. So that's correct. So CP is 25.\n\nThen the second part is sold for Rs25.75. So that's 25.75, which is higher than 25, so profit.\n\nSo the calculation seems correct. So the answer is B:3% Profit.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Oh! Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Because 25.75 is lower than the original selling price of 27.50, so perhaps in the second case, the selling price is lower than the original, but higher than the cost.\n\nSo the profit is 0.75, which is 3% of 25.\n\nSo the correct answer is B.\n\nBut looking at the options, I don't see any option with 3% profit as the correct answer. Wait, no, option B is 3% Profit.\n\nWait, but perhaps the question is asking about the change in profit compared to the original selling price. No, the question is simply, what would be the profit or loss percentage if sold at 25.75, regardless of the original selling price.\n\nSo the calculation is correct. So the answer is option B:3% Profit.\n\nWait, but the options have option B as 3% Profit, which is what I calculated. So the correct answer is B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we first determine the cost price (CP) of the book. The book was sold for Rs. 27.50 with a 10% profit.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about profit and loss. Let me read it again. The question is about a book that was sold for Rs 27.50 with a 10% profit. Then, if it were sold for Rs 25.75, what would be the percentage of profit or loss?\n\nHmm, I remember that profit and loss calculations involve cost price, selling price, and the percentage. So, first, I think I need to find the cost price of the book. Because once I have that, I can compare the selling prices to determine if there's a profit or loss in the second scenario.\n\nThe first part says it was sold for Rs 27.50 with a 10% profit. So, the selling price is higher than the cost price. The formula for profit is: Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit. And profit is calculated as a percentage of the cost price. So, Profit = Cost Price * (Profit Percentage / 100).\n\nLet me denote the cost price as CP. So, the selling price when there's a 10% profit is CP + 10% of CP. Which can be written as CP * (1 + 10/100) = CP * 1.1.\n\nWe know the selling price is 27.50, so:\n\n27.50 = CP * 1.1\n\nTo find CP, I can divide 27.50 by 1.1. Let me do that calculation. 27.50 divided by 1.1. Hmm, 1.1 times 25 is 27.5, because 25 * 1.1 is 27.5. So, CP is 25 Rs. Oh, okay, that makes sense.\n\nNow, the second part: if it's sold for 25.75, what's the profit or loss percentage?\n\nI need to compare 25.75 with the cost price of 25. So, the selling price is 25.75. Let me calculate the difference between selling price and cost price.\n\n25.75 - 25 = 0.75. So, the selling price is higher than the cost by 0.75. Wait, wait a minute, no, wait. Because 25.75 is less than 27.50, but wait, the cost price is 25. So, 25.75 is higher than 25 by 0.75.\n\nWait, no, 25.75 is more than 25, right? Because 25.75 minus 25 is 0.75. So, the selling price is higher than cost price by 0.75. That would mean a profit, not a loss. But looking at the options, the options are about profit or loss percentages.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me double-check. The first selling price was 27.50, which is a 10% profit. The cost is 25. So, the second selling price is 25.75, which is 25.75 - 25 = 0.75 higher. So, that's a profit of 0.75 on the cost price of 25.\n\nSo, the profit percentage would be (0.75 / 25) * 100%. Let me calculate that. 0.75 divided by 25 is 0.03. Multiply by 100 gives 3%. So, a 3% profit.\n\nBut wait, that's not matching with the options given. Let me look at the options again. The options are A) 2% Profit, B)3% Profit, C)2% Loss, D)3% Loss, E)4% Loss.\n\nWait, but according to my calculation, the profit is 3%, so the answer would be B.\n\nBut wait, let me check again because I might have made a mistake. Let me recalculate. So, the cost price is 25. Selling price is 25.75. So, 25.75 is higher than 25 by 0.75. So, profit is 0.75. Profit percentage is (0.75 / 25) * 100. Let's compute that: 0.75 /25 = 0.03, which is 3%.\n\nSo, that's a 3% profit. So, the correct answer is B.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Another way to think: What if the selling price is lower than cost? No, in this case, 25.75 is higher than 25, so it's a profit, not a loss. So, the options C, D, E are losses, which don't apply here. So, the correct answer must be either A or B.\n\nSince my calculation gives 3%, the answer is B.\n\nWait, but another approach: Let me calculate the percentage based on cost price. So, 25.75 is the new selling price. The cost is 25. So, profit is 0.75. So, 0.75 is what percentage of 25? (0.75/25)*100 = 3%.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the answer is B, 3% profit.\n",

So, the selling price is higher than the cost price. The formula for profit is: Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit. And profit is calculated as a percentage of the cost price. So, Profit = Cost Price * (Profit Percentage / 100).\n\nLet me denote the cost price as CP. So, the selling price when there's a 10% profit is CP + 10% of CP. Which can be written as CP * (1 + 10/100) = CP * 1.1.\n\nWe know the selling price is 27.50, so:\n\n27.50 = CP * 1.1\n\nTo find CP, I can divide 27.50 by 1.1. Let me do that calculation. 27.50 divided by 1.1. Hmm, 1.1 times 25 is 27.5, because 25 * 1.1 is 27.5. So, CP is 25 Rs. Oh, okay, that makes sense.\n\nNow, the second part: if it's sold for 25.75, what's the profit or loss percentage?\n\nI need to compare 25.75 with the cost price of 25. So, the selling price is 25.75. Let me calculate the difference between selling price and cost price.\n\n25.75 - 25 = 0.75. So, the selling price is higher than the cost by 0.75. Wait, wait a minute, no, wait. Because 25.75 is less than 27.50, but wait, the cost price is 25. So, 25.75 is higher than 25 by 0.75.\n\nWait, no, 25.75 is more than 25, right? Because 25.75 minus 25 is 0.75. So, the selling price is higher than cost price by 0.75. That would mean a profit, not a loss. But looking at the options, the options are about profit or loss percentages.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me double-check. The first selling price was 27.50, which is a 10% profit. The cost is 25. So, the second selling price is 25.75, which is 25.75 - 25 = 0.75 higher. So, that's a profit of 0.75 on the cost price of 25.\n\nSo, the profit percentage would be (0.75 / 25) * 100%. Let me calculate that. 0.75 divided by 25 is 0.03. Multiply by 100 gives 3%. So, a 3% profit.\n\nBut wait, that's not matching with the options given. Let me look at the options again. The options are A) 2% Profit, B)3% Profit, C)2% Loss, D)3% Loss, E)4% Loss.\n\nWait, but according to my calculation, the profit is 3%, so the answer would be B.\n\nBut wait, let me check again because I might have made a mistake. Let me recalculate. So, the cost price is 25. Selling price is 25.75. So, 25.75 is higher than 25 by 0.75. So, profit is 0.75. Profit percentage is (0.75 / 25) * 100. Let's compute that: 0.75 /25 = 0.03, which is 3%.\n\nSo, that's a 3% profit. So, the correct answer is B.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Another way to think: What if the selling price is lower than cost? No, in this case, 25.75 is higher than 25, so it's a profit, not a loss. So, the options C, D, E are losses, which don't apply here. So, the correct answer must be either A or B.\n\nSince my calculation gives 3%, the answer is B.\n\nWait, but another approach: Let me calculate the percentage based on cost price. So, 25.75 is the new selling price. The cost is 25. So, profit is 0.75. So, 0.75 is what percentage of 25? (0.75/25)*100 = 3%.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the answer is B, 3% profit.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we first determine the cost price (CP) of the book. The book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a 10% profit. Using the formula for selling price:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Selling Price} = \\text{CP} \\times (1 + \\frac{\\text{Profit Percentage}}{100})\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[\n27.50 = \\text{CP} \\times 1.1\n\\]\n\nSolving for CP:\n\n\\[\n\\text{CP} = \\frac{27.50}{1.1} = 25 \\, \\text{Rs}\n\\]\n\nNext, we analyze the second scenario where the book is sold for Rs 25.75. The difference between the selling price and the cost price is:\n\n\\[\n25.75 - 25 = 0.75 \\, \\text{Rs}\n\\]\n\nThis indicates a profit of Rs 0.75. To calculate the profit percentage:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Profit Percentage} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Profit}}{\\text{CP}}\\right) \\times 100 = \\left(\\frac{0.75}{25}\\right) \\times 100 = 3\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, selling the book for Rs 25.75 results in a 3% profit. Comparing this with the options, the correct answer is:\n\n**B) 3% Profit**\n\nAnswer: B",

Because once I know the cost price, I can see what the profit or loss would be if it's sold for a different amount.\n\nWait, right. Profit is calculated on the cost price. So if selling price is 27.50 and that's with a 10% profit, then the cost price must be less than 27.50. How do I calculate that?\n\nOh, right, the formula for profit is: Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price. And Profit Percentage = (Profit / Cost Price) * 100. So in this case, the profit is 10%, so I can rearrange that.\n\nLet me denote the cost price as CP. The selling price is 27.50, which is equal to CP plus 10% of CP. So that's SP = CP + (10% of CP) \u2192 SP = 1.10 * CP.\n\nSo to find CP, I can divide the selling price by 1.10. Let me do that: 27.50 divided by 1.10. Hmm, 27.50 / 1.1 is 25. So the cost price is Rs 25.\n\nWait, let me check that. 25 multiplied by 1.1 is 27.5, yes. So that makes sense. So the cost price is 25.\n\nNow, the second part of the question is, if the book were sold for Rs 25.75, what would be the profit or loss percentage?\n\nSo the new selling price is 25.75. Now, I need to compare this to the cost price to see if it's a profit or loss.\n\nLet me calculate the difference. New SP is 25.75, CP is 25. So 25.75 - 25 = 0.75. Wait, that's a positive number, so that's a profit of 0.75.\n\nWait no, wait. Wait, 25.75 is less than 27.50, but more than 25. So if you sell it for 25.75, you're making a profit of 0.75 over the cost price of 25. Because 25.75 is more than 25. Oh, wait, no, wait. Wait a second, 25.75 is more than 25? Wait, 25.75 is 25 and 3/4, so yes, it's 25.75 which is 25 plus 0.75. So selling price is higher than cost price, so it's a profit.\n\nWait, but wait, the cost price is 25, and selling at 25.75 is 0.75 higher, so profit is 0.75. So the profit percentage is (profit / cost price) * 100. So 0.75 / 25 * 100.\n\nCalculating that: 0.75 / 25 is 0.03, times 100 is 3%. So a 3% profit.\n\nWait, but wait, the options have a 3% profit as option B and 3% loss as D. So the correct answer would be 3% profit.\n\nWait, but wait a second, wait. No, wait. Oh no, no. Wait, no, no. Because 25.75 is less than 27.50. Oh, but that's not relevant because the cost is 25. So selling at 25.75 is still a profit. Because 25.75 is higher than 25.\n\nWait, let me double-check the numbers. Cost is 25. Sold for 25.75. So profit is 0.75, which is 3% of 25. So yes, a 3% profit.\n\nBut wait, the options also have a 3% loss. Did I miscalculate?\n\nWait, wait. Let me see. Wait, 25.75 is 25.75, and the cost is 25. So the difference is +0.75, which is a profit. So the profit is 3%, so option B.\n\nBut let me think again. Is there any possibility that I messed up the calculation? Let me recheck.\n\nCP is 25. SP1 is 27.50, which gives a 10% profit. So that's correct.\n\nThen, SP2 is 25.75. So 25.75 minus 25 is 0.75 profit. 0.75 is what percentage of 25?\n\n(0.75 /25)*100 = (3/100)*100 = 3%. So yes, 3% profit.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is 3% profit. So the answer should be B.\n\nBut wait, the options are:\n\nA)2% Profit\n\nB)3% Profit\n\nC)2% Loss\n\nD)3% Loss\n\nE)4% Loss\n\nSo the correct answer would be B, 3% profit.\n\nWait, but wait, another angle. Did the problem ask for the percentage relative to the original cost or the new cost? No, the cost remains the same, it's the same book.

So the first step is probably to find out the cost price of the book. Because once I have that, I can compare it to the new selling price to see if it's a profit or loss.\n\nAlright, the book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a 10% profit. So, the selling price (SP) is 110% of the cost price (CP), because 100% is the cost and 10% is the profit. So, the formula would be SP = CP + (10% of CP) \u2192 SP = 1.1 * CP.\n\nSo, I can write the equation as 27.50 = 1.1 * CP. To find CP, I need to divide 27.50 by 1.1. Let me calculate that. 27.50 divided by 1.1. Hmm, 1.1 times 25 is 27.5, right? Because 25 * 1.1 = 27.5.

Yep, that's correct.\n\nNow, the second part is if the book is sold for Rs 25.75. I need to find out the profit or loss percentage compared to the cost price.\n\nSo, the new selling price is 25.75.

No, wait, no, wait. 25.75 is less than 27.50 but more than 25. Wait, 25.75 is greater than 25. Oh, so if the cost is 25 and the selling price is 25.75, that's a profit of 0.75. Hmm, but wait, no. Wait, 25.75 is more than 25, so it's a profit. Wait, but wait, the question says, if it were sold for Rs 25.75, what would be the profit or loss? Oh, wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, no, 25.75 is less than the original selling price of 27.50, but more than the cost price of 25. So, selling at 25.75 would still be a profit, but a smaller profit than before. Wait, but wait, wait a second. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, the cost is 25. So, selling at 25.75 would be a profit of 25.75 -25 = 0.75. So, profit is 0.75 on a cost of 25. So, the profit percentage would be (0.75 /25)*100%.\n\nCalculating that: 0.75 divided by 25 is 0.03, multiplied by 100 gives 3%. So, that's a 3% profit. But wait, that's not one of the options. Wait, let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions are A)2% Profit, B)3% Profit, C)2% Loss, D)3% Loss, E)4% Loss.\n\nWait, I thought it would be a profit. So option B is 3% profit. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the cost price. Let me recheck that.\n\nOriginal selling price is Rs 27.50 with 10% profit. So, 27.50 = 1.1 * CP. So, CP = 27.50 / 1.1 = 25. Correct.\n\nSo, when selling at 25.75, which is 25.75 -25 = 0.75 above cost, which is a profit. So, the profit is 0.75, which is 3% of 25. So, that's a 3% profit. So, the answer would be option B.\n\nWait, but wait, the options include a 3% loss. Oh, wait, no, option B is 3% profit. So that's possible.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. If the new selling price is 25.75, which is less than the original selling price, but more than the cost price, so it's still a profit.\n\nWait, but wait, the question is a bit confusing. Wait, the question says, \"then would have been percentage of profit and loss?\" So, if the selling price is 25.75, which is higher than cost, so profit. But let me check the calculations again.\n\nWait, 25.75 is the new selling price. Cost is 25. So, 25.75-25=0.75 profit.\n\nProfit percentage: (0.75 /25)*100 = 3%. So, 3% profit. So, the correct option is B.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is 3% profit. So that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the initial step. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me compute the cost price correctly. The selling price is 27.50, which is 110% of CP. So, 27.50 = 1.1 * CP \u2192 CP = 27.50 /1.1 = 25.\n\nNow, if the book is sold at 25.75, which is more than CP of 25, so profit.\n\nProfit amount: 25.75 -25 = 0.75.\n\nProfit percentage: (0.75/25)*100 = 3%.\n\nSo, the answer is option B.\n\nBut wait, looking back, the options are A to E, with B as 3% profit.

So, the selling price (SP) is 110% of the cost price (CP), because 100% is the cost and 10% is the profit. So, the formula would be SP = CP + (10% of CP) \u2192 SP = 1.1 * CP.\n\nSo, I can write the equation as 27.50 = 1.1 * CP. To find CP, I need to divide 27.50 by 1.1. Let me calculate that. 27.50 divided by 1.1. Hmm, 1.1 times 25 is 27.5, right? Because 25 * 1.1 = 27.5. So, the cost price is Rs 25.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 25 multiplied by 1.1. 25 *1 is 25, 25 *0.1 is 2.5, so total is 27.5. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNow, the second part is if the book is sold for Rs 25.75. I need to find out the profit or loss percentage compared to the cost price.\n\nSo, the new selling price is 25.75. The cost price is 25. So, let's see: 25.75 is more than 25, so that would be a profit, right? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 25.75 is higher than 25? No, wait, no, wait. 25.75 is less than 27.50 but more than 25. Wait, 25.75 is greater than 25. Oh, so if the cost is 25 and the selling price is 25.75, that's a profit of 0.75. Hmm, but wait, no. Wait, 25.75 is more than 25, so it's a profit. Wait, but wait, the question says, if it were sold for Rs 25.75, what would be the profit or loss? Oh, wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, no, 25.75 is less than the original selling price of 27.50, but more than the cost price of 25. So, selling at 25.75 would still be a profit, but a smaller profit than before. Wait, but wait, wait a second. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, the cost is 25. So, selling at 25.75 would be a profit of 25.75 -25 = 0.75. So, profit is 0.75 on a cost of 25. So, the profit percentage would be (0.75 /25)*100%.\n\nCalculating that: 0.75 divided by 25 is 0.03, multiplied by 100 gives 3%. So, that's a 3% profit. But wait, that's not one of the options. Wait, let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions are A)2% Profit, B)3% Profit, C)2% Loss, D)3% Loss, E)4% Loss.\n\nWait, I thought it would be a profit. So option B is 3% profit. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the cost price. Let me recheck that.\n\nOriginal selling price is Rs 27.50 with 10% profit. So, 27.50 = 1.1 * CP. So, CP = 27.50 / 1.1 = 25. Correct.\n\nSo, when selling at 25.75, which is 25.75 -25 = 0.75 above cost, which is a profit. So, the profit is 0.75, which is 3% of 25. So, that's a 3% profit. So, the answer would be option B.\n\nWait, but wait, the options include a 3% loss. Oh, wait, no, option B is 3% profit. So that's possible.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. If the new selling price is 25.75, which is less than the original selling price, but more than the cost price, so it's still a profit.\n\nWait, but wait, the question is a bit confusing. Wait, the question says, \"then would have been percentage of profit and loss?\" So, if the selling price is 25.75, which is higher than cost, so profit. But let me check the calculations again.\n\nWait, 25.75 is the new selling price. Cost is 25. So, 25.75-25=0.75 profit.\n\nProfit percentage: (0.75 /25)*100 = 3%. So, 3% profit. So, the correct option is B.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is 3% profit. So that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the initial step. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me compute the cost price correctly. The selling price is 27.50, which is 110% of CP. So, 27.50 = 1.1 * CP \u2192 CP = 27.50 /1.1 = 25.\n\nNow, if the book is sold at 25.75, which is more than CP of 25, so profit.\n\nProfit amount: 25.75 -25 = 0.75.\n\nProfit percentage: (0.75/25)*100 = 3%.\n\nSo, the answer is option B.\n\nBut wait, looking back, the options are A to E, with B as 3% profit. So the correct answer is B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we first determine the cost price (CP) of the book. The book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a 10% profit, meaning the selling price (SP) is 110% of the CP. Using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{SP} = 1.1 \\times \\text{CP}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given SP:\n\n\\[\n27.50 = 1.1 \\times \\text{CP}\n\\]\n\nSolving for CP:\n\n\\[\n\\text{CP} = \\frac{27.50}{1.1} = 25\n\\]\n\nThus, the cost price of the book is Rs 25.\n\nNext, we analyze the scenario where the book is sold for Rs 25.75. To determine whether this results in a profit or loss, we compare the new selling price (25.75) to the cost price (25). The difference is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Profit or Loss} = 25.75 - 25 = 0.75\n\\]\n\nSince the selling price is higher than the cost price, this represents a profit. To calculate the profit percentage:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Profit Percentage} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Profit}}{\\text{CP}}\\right) \\times 100 = \\left(\\frac{0.75}{25}\\right) \\times 100 = 3\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, selling the book for Rs 25.75 results in a 3% profit. Comparing this to the options provided, the correct answer is:\n\n**B) 3% Profit**\n\nAnswer: B",
