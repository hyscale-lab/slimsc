      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about electric poles and trees casting shadows, and I need to find the height of a tree based on the shadow it casts. Hmm, let's see. I remember from school that when dealing with shadows and heights, similar triangles are probably involved. Oh right, because the sun's rays are coming at the same angle for both the pole and the tree, their heights and shadows form similar triangles.\n\nAlright, the problem says the electric pole is 14 meters high and casts a shadow of 10 meters. So the pole's height is 14m, shadow is 10m. The tree's shadow is 15m, and I need to find its height. Let me think about the ratio here.\n\nSince the triangles are similar, the ratios of their corresponding sides should be equal. So the ratio of the pole's height to its shadow should be the same as the tree's height to its shadow. That makes sense because similar triangles have proportional sides.\n\nLet me write that as a formula. So, (Height of pole) / (Shadow of pole) = (Height of tree) / (Shadow of tree). Plugging in the known values, it becomes 14 / 10 = H / 15, where H is the tree's height I'm trying to find.\n\nWait, let me make sure I got that right. Yeah, similar triangles, so the ratio is consistent. So 14 over 10 equals H over 15. To solve for H, I can cross-multiply. That would give me 14 * 15 = 10 * H. Let me calculate that.\n\n14 multiplied by 15 is... 14 times 10 is 140, and 14 times 5 is 70, so 140 +70 is 210. So 210 equals 10H. To find H, I divide both sides by 10. So H is 210 /10, which is 21 meters.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 21. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, did I do that correctly? Let me double-check. The pole is 14m, shadow 10m. So the ratio is 14:10, which simplifies to 7:5. The tree's shadow is 15m, so I need to find the height that gives the same ratio 7:5. So 7/5 = H/15. Cross-multiplying, 5H=7*15=105. H=21. Yep, same result. So I'm confident that the answer is A)21.\n",

Oh right, similar triangles! Because the sun's rays are coming at the same angle, so the triangles formed by the objects and their shadows are similar.\n\nSo the electric pole is 14 meters high and casts a shadow of 10 meters.

So the proportion would be:\n\n14 / 10 = h / 15\n\nWait, or is it the other way around? Maybe it's the shadow over the height? No, no, wait. Because both are height divided by shadow length.

So the answer should be A.\n\n\nThe problem involves using similar triangles to relate the height of an electric pole to its shadow and the height of a tree to its shadow under the same sunlight conditions. Since the triangles formed by the pole and its shadow, and the tree and its shadow, are similar, the ratios of their corresponding sides are equal.\n\nLet the height of the tree be \\( h \\). The given ratios are:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Height of pole}}{\\text{Shadow of pole}} = \\frac{\\text{Height of tree}}{\\text{Shadow of tree}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{14}{10} = \\frac{h}{15}\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying to solve for \\( h \\):\n\n\\[\n14 \\times 15 = 10 \\times h\n\\]\n\n\\[\n210 = 10h\n\\]\n\n\\[\nh = \\frac{210}{10} = 21\n\\]\n\nThus, the height of the tree is 21 meters.

Let me think. \n\nThe electric pole is 14 meters high and casts a shadow of 10 meters. Then there's a tree that casts a shadow of 15 meters, and I need to find its height. Oh right, similar triangles because the sun's rays would create similar angles for both the pole and the tree, so their heights and shadows should be proportional.\n\nWait, so the ratio of the height to the shadow length should be the same for both. So for the electric pole, the ratio is 14/10. Let me write that down. 14 divided by 10 is 1.4. So the tree's height divided by its shadow (15 meters) should equal the same ratio. So if I let h be the tree's height, then h/15 = 14/10.\n\nSolving for h, I can cross-multiply. 14 * 15 equals 10 * h. Let me calculate 14*15. 14 times 10 is 140, 14 times 5 is 70, so total is 210.
