      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says that Jack can clean a yacht by himself in 12 hours. On this particular day, he finishes two-thirds of the work, and the remaining part is done by Jill. But Jill's cleaning rate is only 5% of what Jack can do. I need to find out how long it takes Jill to finish the remaining work. The options are A)4, B)8, C)22, D)50, E)20.\n\nHmm, right. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I think I should find out how much work Jack does and then how much is left for Jill. Since work problems usually involve rates, maybe it's best to calculate their rates and then time.\n\nJack's time to clean the yacht alone is 12 hours. So, his work rate is 1/12 of the job per hour. That makes sense because if he does 1/12 each hour, after 12 hours he completes 1 whole job.\n\nNow, on this day, Jack does two-thirds of the work. Wait, does that mean he works for two-thirds of the time, or he completes two-thirds of the job? I think it's the latter. The question says he \"happens to finish two-thirds of the work,\" so he's done 2/3 of the cleaning.\n\nSo, if the total work is 1 unit (like 1 yacht cleaned), Jack does 2/3 of that. That leaves 1/3 remaining for Jill.\n\nBut wait, how long does Jack take to do two-thirds of the work? Maybe that's not necessary because the question only asks about the time Jill takes. But perhaps I need to know his rate to find her rate.\n\nWait, Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's. So, first, find Jack's rate, then multiply by 0.05 to get Jill's rate.\n\nJack's rate is 1/12 per hour. So Jill's rate is (1/12) * 0.05.\n\nCalculating that: 0.05 is 5%, so 1/12 * 1/20 = 1/(12*20) = 1/240 per hour. Wait, no, 5% is 0.05, so 1/12 * 0.05 = 0.05/12 \u2248 0.00416667 per hour.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of fractions. 5% of 1/12 is (5/100) * (1/12) = (1/20) * (1/12) = 1/240 per hour.\n\nSo Jill can do 1/240 of the job each hour.\n\nShe has 1/3 of the job left. Time equals work divided by rate, so her time is (1/3) / (1/240) hours.\n\nDividing fractions: (1/3) * (240/1) = 240/3 = 80 hours.\n\nWait, but none of the options are 80. Hmm, the options are 4,8,22,50,20. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, I think I may have messed up the initial steps. Let me try another approach.\n\nJack can clean the yacht in 12 hours. So his rate is 1/12 per hour.\n\nHe does two-thirds of the work, so the amount of work he does is 2/3. The time he takes to do 2/3 is (2/3) divided by his rate. Time is work divided by rate.\n\nSo time for Jack is (2/3) / (1/12) = (2/3) * 12 = 8 hours. So Jack works for 8 hours, completing 2/3 of the job.\n\nWait, but the question doesn't ask how long Jack took, just how long Jill takes. The remaining work is 1/3, and Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's.\n\nJack's rate is 1/12 per hour. 5% of that is 0.05 * (1/12) = 1/240 per hour.\n\nSo the remaining work is 1/3. So time for Jill is (1/3) / (1/240) = 80 hours. But 80 isn't an option. Hmm.\n\nWait, the options provided are A)4, B)8, C)22, D)50, E)20. None of these is 80. Did I make a mistake here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the way I calculated the rates is wrong. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I swapped the work and time. Let me think differently.\n\nAnother approach: The total work is 1 yacht. Jack does 2/3 of it, so the remaining is 1/3.\n\nJack's rate is 1/12 per hour, so in t hours, he does t*(1/12) = 2/3. Solving for t: t = (2/3)/(1/12) = (2/3)*12 = 8 hours. That matches.\n\nSo Jill has 1/3 of the work left. Her rate is 5% of Jack's. So 5% of 1/12 is (5/100)*(1/12) = (1/20)*(1/12) = 1/240 per hour. So her rate is 1/240 per hour.\n\nSo time for Jill is (1/3) divided by (1/240) = 240/3 = 80 hours. But that's not among the options. Hmm, that suggests I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe the question says that Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's time? No, the question says \"Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do.\" So it's 5% of his rate, not time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the rate.\n\nWait, 5% of Jack's rate is 0.05 * (1/12) = 0.0041666... per hour. So, how much time does Jill take to do 1/3 of the work at 0.0041666 per hour?\n\nTime = Work / Rate = (1/3) / (0.0041666...).\n\nLet me calculate that. 1/3 is approximately 0.333333. Divided by 0.0041666... which is 0.0041666.\n\n0.333333 / 0.0041666 \u2248 80. So 80 hours, which isn't an option. But the options don't have 80. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me read the question again. Oh, wait a minute: \"Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do.\" So maybe I inverted the numbers. Let me think: if Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's, then yes, it's 0.05 times Jack's rate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've mixed up the rates. Maybe Jack's rate is 12 hours per job, so 1/12 per hour, and Jill's rate is 5% of that, which is 0.05*(1/12) = 1/240 per hour.\n\nSo, Jill's time is (1/3)/(1/240) = 80 hours.\n\nBut the options don't include 80. Hmm, maybe I should re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is that Jack finishes two-thirds of the work, but the total work is the same as the yacht. So, perhaps the work is 1, and the remaining is 1/3.\n\nWait, but in that case, my calculation leads to 80 hours, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying the 5%. Let me do the calculation another way.\n\nJack's rate: 1/12 per hour.\n\nJill's rate: 5% of that is 0.05*(1/12) = 1/240 per hour.\n\nSo, work left: 1/3.\n\nTime = (1/3) / (1/240) = (1/3) * (240/1) = 80.\n\nWait, 80 isn't an option. So perhaps I'm miscalculating somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says that Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's time, but that's not what the problem says. The problem says rate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the question. Maybe the two-thirds is the time Jack worked, not the work done. Let me re-examine the question.\n\nThe question says: \"he happens to finish two-thirds of the work.\" So, that indicates that the work done is two-thirds, not the time spent. So, in that case, Jack's time would be 2/3 divided by his rate, which is (2/3)/(1/12) = 8 hours. So that part is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the time as (1/3) / (0.05 * (1/12)).\n\nWait, 0.05 is the same as 1/20. So, (1/3) / ( (1/20) * (1/12) ) = (1/3) / (1/(240)) ) = 80. Still 80.\n\nWait, the options are A:4, B:8, C:22, D:50, E:20.\n\nHmm, none of these is 80. But perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is that Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate, but in the same unit. Oh, perhaps the time is 5% of Jack's time. Wait, that would be a different approach.\n\nWait, let's re-express the problem.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's say the total work is 1 yacht.\n\nJack's rate is 1/12 yachts per hour.\n\nHe finishes two-thirds of the work, which is 2/3. So, time taken by Jack is (2/3) / (1/12) = (2/3) * 12 = 8 hours.\n\nSo, Jill does the remaining 1/3.\n\nJill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate. So, 5% of 1/12 is 0.05 * (1/12) = 0.00416667 yachts per hour.\n\nSo, time for Jill is (1/3) / 0.00416667 \u2248 80 hours.\n\nBut since 80 isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the units. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the rates are per day or something? No, the problem says \"by himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours.\" So, the rates are per hour.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating Jill's rate.\n\nWait, 5% of Jack's rate. Jack's rate is 1/12 per hour. So 5% is (5/100) * (1/12) = (1/20)*(1/12) = 1/(240) per hour.\n\nSo, time is (1/3) / (1/240) = 80 hours.\n\nI'm getting the same result each time. But the options don't have 80. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps I misread it.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: \"the remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do.\"\n\nWait, perhaps Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate in terms of time? That might not make sense, but let's think.\n\nWait, if Jill takes 5% of Jack's time to do the same job, that would imply her rate is 20 times faster. But that would make her finish the remaining work in 8 hours, which is option B. But that's not correct because the question says her rate is 5% of Jack's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of time instead of rates.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's compute the time it takes Jill to do 1/3 of the work, given her rate is 5% of Jack's.\n\nJack's time per yacht is 12 hours, so his rate is 1/12 per hour.\n\nJill's rate is 5% of that: 0.05 * (1/12) = 1/240 per hour.\n\nSo, the time she takes is (1/3) / (1/240) = 80 hours. But that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a step. Let me think: Wait, maybe the problem is phrased as \"5% of the work,\" but that's not what it says. It says her rate is 5% of Jack's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misapplying the 5%. Let me compute it again.\n\nJack's rate: 1/12 per hour.\n\nJill's rate: 0.05 * (1/12) = 0.05/12 = 1/240 per hour.\n\nSo, time for Jill to do 1/3 is:\n\n(1/3) / (1/240) = (1/3) * 240 = 80 hours.\n\nHmm, not matching any options. So perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the work is measured as hours, and I'm confusing that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the time Jill takes to finish the remaining two-thirds, but that's not what the question says. The question says she does the remaining portion, which is 1/3.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is phrased such that Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's time, but that's not what it says. It says rate is 5% of Jack's rate.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of time instead of rates. Let me see.\n\nIf Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's, then her time per unit work is 20 times longer than Jack's.\n\nWait, because rate and time are inversely proportional. So if her rate is 5% of Jack's, her time per unit work is 1/0.05 = 20 times longer.\n\nSo, for any given work, Jill takes 20 times as long as Jack.\n\nSo, if Jack takes 12 hours for the whole job, Jill would take 12 *20 = 240 hours. But she only has 1/3 of the job.\n\nSo, her time would be (240) * (1/3) = 80 hours. Again, same result.\n\nBut 80 isn't an option. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait, looking at the options, the closest I can see is 80 is not present, but perhaps I miscalculated the fraction.\n\nWait, the problem says Jill does the remaining portion after Jack does two-thirds. So, the remaining is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I'm calculating the time for the entire 1/3, but perhaps Jill's rate is higher. Wait, no, her rate is 5% of Jack's, so it's lower.\n\nWait, but the options given don't include 80. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the question says that Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate, but in reverse. Like, perhaps I should compute based on time per unit.\n\nWait, let me think again. Jack's rate is 1/12 per hour. So Jill's is 5% of that. So 0.05 * (1/12) = 1/240 per hour.\n\nSo, to do 1/3 of the work, the time is (1/3) / (1/240) = 80 hours.\n\nBut 80 isn't among the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says that Jill does the same work as Jack in 5% of the time, which would make her rate 20 times higher. But that's not what the problem says. The problem says her rate is 5% of Jack's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the time that Jill takes to do the entire job, not the remaining part. But no, the question says the remaining portion.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is that I'm interpreting the rates correctly, but perhaps the problem is in the way the work is split. Let me re-read the question.\n\n\"By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work?\"\n\nSo, yes, Jack does two-thirds, Jill does the remaining one-third, and her rate is 5% of Jack's.\n\nHmm. Let's compute the time again.\n\nJack's rate: 1/12 per hour.\n\nJill's rate: 0.05 * (1/12) = 1/240 per hour.\n\nWork left: 1/3.\n\nTime = (1/3) / (1/240) = 80 hours.\n\nBut, the options don't have 80. I must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the time it takes for Jill to do the entire job, but that's not what's being asked.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is phrased such that the remaining work is done by Jill in a certain time, but perhaps the two-thirds is the time Jack worked, not the work. Let me check that possibility.\n\nIf Jack worked for two-thirds of the time, which would be two-thirds of 12 hours, which is 8 hours. So in 8 hours, how much work would he have done?\n\nAt his rate of 1/12 per hour, in 8 hours, he would have done 8 * (1/12) = 8/12 = 2/3 of the work. So that's consistent with the first scenario.\n\nSo the initial setup is correct.\n\nWait, but then Jill has to do 1/3, and her rate is 5% of Jack's. So 80 hours. Again, not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the rate. Let me compute 5% of 1/12 again.\n\n5% is 0.05. So 0.05 * (1/12) = 0.004166666...\n\nWhich is 1/240. So that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of work done.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in the way the work is measured. Maybe the work is measured in man-hours, but I don't think so.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I should compute the time it takes for Jill to do her part, but considering that she works alongside Jack. No, the problem says she does the remaining after Jack finishes his part.\n\nHmm. Maybe the problem is phrased differently. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me compute how much work Jill does per hour.\n\nJack's rate: 1/12 per hour.\n\nJill's rate: 0.05 * (1/12) = 1/240 per hour.\n\nShe has to do 1/3 of the work. So time = (1/3) / (1/240) = 80 hours.\n\nHmm. So 80 is not an option. So perhaps the problem is that I'm misunderstanding the rate.\n\nWait, perhaps the rate is given as a percentage of the time, not the work done per hour. Like, if Jill takes 5% of the time Jack takes to do the same work, then her rate would be 20 times higher.\n\nWait, but that's not what the question says. The question says her rate is 5% of Jack's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate per hour. So, 5% of the rate per hour.\n\nWait, that's what I did earlier. So, 0.05*(1/12) = 1/240 per hour.\n\nSo, in that case, the time is 80 hours.\n\nBut again, 80 is not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the fractions. Let me compute 1/3 divided by 1/240.\n\n(1/3) \u00f7 (1/240) = (1/3) * (240/1) = 240/3 = 80.\n\nYes, that's correct. So why is this not an option? Am I missing something?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says that Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate, but Jack's rate is 5% of someone else's. No, the problem says Jack can do it in 12 hours by himself.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the time Jack took to do the two-thirds. If he took 8 hours, perhaps Jill's time is based on that.\n\nWait, Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's. So, if Jack's rate is 1/12 per hour, Jill's is 1/240.\n\nSo, in 8 hours, Jack did 2/3, and Jill has to do 1/3.\n\nSo, how long does Jill take to do 1/3 at 1/240 per hour?\n\nTime = 80 hours, as before.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is miswritten, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to make a different assumption.\n\nWait, maybe Jill's rate is 5% of the total work, not of Jack's rate. Let me try that.\n\nIf the total work is 1, then 5% of that is 0.05. So, if Jill's rate is 0.05 per hour, then time is (1/3) / 0.05 = 6.666... hours. Which is about 6 2/3, but that's not an option either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the work is considered as 12 units, since Jack takes 12 hours. So each hour, Jack does 1 unit. Then, Jill's rate is 5% of 1 unit per hour, which is 0.05 units per hour.\n\nThe work done by Jack is two-thirds of 12 units, which is 8 units. So the remaining is 4 units.\n\nTime for Jill is 4 / 0.05 = 80 hours. Again, same result.\n\nHmm. So I keep getting 80, but the options don't have that. So I must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement is that Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate, but in the same time Jack takes. Like, if Jack takes t hours, Jill takes t * (1/0.05) = 20t hours.\n\nBut that would mean she takes 20 times longer. So for the remaining 1/3 of the work, which would take Jack (1/3)/(1/12) = 4 hours. So Jill would take 4 * (1/0.05) = 80 hours. Again, same result.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. All calculations lead to 80 hours, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased as \"the remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do in the same time.\" Maybe that's a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that Jack is working with Jill, but the question says he finishes two-thirds, then Jill does the rest. So she works independently.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate, but she only works on the remaining part. So, let's compute how much time she would take.\n\nJack's rate: 1/12 per hour.\n\nJill's rate: 0.05 * (1/12) = 1/240 per hour.\n\nWork left: 1/3.\n\nTime = (1/3) / (1/240) = 80 hours. Again, same result.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the amount of work.\n\nWait, perhaps the total work is two-thirds, and the remaining is one-third. No, the problem says Jack does two-thirds, so the remaining is one-third.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the 5% is of the remaining work's rate, not Jack's. But that doesn't make much sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in the way the rates are calculated. Let me think of it in terms of hours per unit.\n\nJack takes 12 hours per yacht. So his time per unit is 12 hours.\n\nJill's rate is 5% of Jack's. So her time per unit is 12 hours / 0.05 = 240 hours per unit. So she takes 240 hours to do 1 unit.\n\nShe has to do 1/3 unit. So time is 240 * (1/3) = 80 hours.\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at the options again. The options are A)4, B)8, C)22, D)50, E)20.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the fraction. Let me recompute 5% of 1/12.\n\n5% is 0.05.\n\n0.05 * (1/12) = 0.004166666... per hour.\n\nSo, Jill does 0.004166666 units per hour.\n\nThe remaining work is 1/3, which is approximately 0.333333.\n\nTime = 0.333333 / 0.004166666 \u2248 80 hours.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects a different approach.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's find out how long it takes Jill to do 1/3 of the work at a rate 5% of Jack's.\n\nJack's time to do 1/3 of the work is (1/3)/(1/12) = 4 hours.\n\nJill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate, so her time is (1 / 0.05) times Jack's time for the same amount of work.\n\nSo, 4 hours * (1 / 0.05) = 4 * 20 = 80 hours.\n\nStill 80. So, that's the same result.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the time. Let me do it step by step.\n\nJack's rate: 1/12 per hour.\n\nJill's rate: 0.05 * (1/12) = 0.0041666667 per hour.\n\nWork left: 1/3.\n\nTime = 0.333333333 / 0.0041666667.\n\nLet me compute this division: 0.333333333 divided by 0.0041666667.\n\nLet me write it as 1/3 divided by 1/240.\n\nWhich is 1/3 * 240/1 = 80.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct answer is 80 hours, but that's not among the options. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the total work is 12 hours, so the work is 12 units. So Jack's rate is 12 units per 12 hours? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the work is 12 man-hours.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the time in the same unit as Jack's time. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the work is divided into 12 hours, so two-thirds of that is 8 hours. Wait, no, that's not right. Two-thirds of the work, not the time.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that Jack's rate is 12 hours per 1 work unit. So, 1/12 per hour.\n\nJill's rate is 5% of that, which is 0.05/12 per hour.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. 5% of 1/12 is 1/240.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the problem in terms of fractions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should find how much time Jill takes to do 1/3 of the work, given her rate is 5% of Jack's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that I should calculate the time as (remaining work) divided by (Jill's rate).\n\nWhich is what I did, but perhaps I made a calculation error.\n\nWait, let me try an alternative calculation.\n\nIf Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's, then in time t, Jill does 0.05 * Jack's work in same time.\n\nBut since Jack can do 1/12 per hour, in t hours, he would do t/12.\n\nSo, in t hours, Jill would do 0.05 * t/12.\n\nBut she needs to do 1/3.\n\nSo:\n\n0.05 * t/12 = 1/3.\n\nSolving for t:\n\nt = (1/3) / (0.05/12) = (1/3) * (12/0.05) = (4) * (200) = 800/10? Wait, no, let me compute correctly.\n\nWait, (1/3) divided by (0.05/12) equals (1/3) * (12/0.05) = (4) * (20) = 80.\n\nYes, same result again.\n\nI'm really stuck here. All approaches lead to 80, which isn't an option. So maybe the problem is that I'm misinterpreting the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the question says that Jill's rate is 5% of what Jack can do in the same time. So, perhaps her rate is 5% of Jack's rate multiplied by the time he took.\n\nWait, but that doesn't quite make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that Jill's rate is 5% of the total time Jack would take.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe the problem is that I'm not considering that they're working together in some way, but the question says Jack does two-thirds, then Jill does the rest.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the remaining work is done by Jill in the same time as Jack took to do two-thirds. But that's not what the question says.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that I'm supposed to find the time for the entire job, but the question is about the remaining.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the options again. The options are A)4, B)8, C)22, D)50, E)20.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the fraction. Let me think: 5% of 1/12 is 1/240. So, 1/240 per hour.\n\nSo, work left is 1/3.\n\nTime = (1/3) / (1/240) = 80 hours.\n\nHmm. I'm not finding any mistake in this logic.\n\nWait, another thought: Perhaps the problem is that Jack's rate is 12 hours per job, so 1/12 per hour. Jill's rate is 5% of that, so 0.05 * 12 = 0.6 hours per unit. Wait, no, that makes no sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rate is in terms of time. So, if Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's time per unit, then she takes 5% of 12 hours, which is 0.6 hours per unit. But that seems off.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me consider that maybe the correct answer is 80, but it's not listed. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that Jack's rate is 12 hours, so Jill's rate is 5% of 12 hours, meaning she takes 0.6 hours per unit. But that doesn't fit with the rates.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is phrased such that Jill's rate is 5% the time Jack takes, which would make her time per unit 20 times longer, leading to 240 hours for the entire job, but the remaining is 1/3, so 80.\n\nBut again, same result.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem's options were mislabeled. Or perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the remaining work is two-thirds, not one-third. Wait, no, because Jack did two-thirds, so remaining is one-third.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of man-hours.\n\nJack's rate is 1/12 per hour, so in 1 hour, he does 1/12 of the work.\n\nJill's rate is 0.05 * (1/12) = 1/240 per hour.\n\nShe needs to do 1/3.\n\nTime = (1/3) / (1/240) = 80 hours.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I should just go with 80, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that two-thirds is the time Jack worked, not the work. Let me try that.\n\nIf Jack worked for two-thirds of the time, which is (2/3)*12 = 8 hours.\n\nIn 8 hours, he would have done 8*(1/12) = 2/3 of the work.\n\nThen, the remaining is 1/3.\n\nJill's rate is 5% of Jack's, so 1/240 per hour.\n\nTime is 80 hours.\n\nSame result. So I'm confident the answer is 80, but no option matches. So perhaps I'm missing a key point.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the work is divided into 12 parts, each part taking Jack one hour. So two-thirds is 8 parts. Then, the remaining is 4 parts.\n\nJill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate. So, if each part takes Jack one hour, Jill's rate is 0.05 parts per hour.\n\nSo, 4 parts \u00f7 0.05 parts per hour = 80 hours.\n\nSame result again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the options are in a different unit. Like, in days instead of hours. But the options are labeled without units, so that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the time is 80 minutes, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the time in another way.\n\nWait, 80 hours is 3 days and 8 hours, which is a long time, but perhaps that's correct.\n\nHmm. So, given that none of the options match, perhaps the correct answer is not provided, but among the options, the closest is not present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the remaining work is one-third, and Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's, so her time is (1/3)/(0.05*(1/12)) = (1/3)/(1/240) = 80.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the time is per man-hour or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the work is considered as 12 units, so 12 hours for Jack.\n\nJack's rate: 1 unit per hour.\n\nJill's rate: 5% of that is 0.05 units per hour.\n\nHe does two-thirds of 12 units, which is 8 units. So, remaining is 4 units.\n\nTime for Jill: 4 / 0.05 = 80 hours.\n\nSame result.\n\nI'm out of ideas. So, I think the correct answer is 80, but it's not an option. So perhaps the problem has a typo, or I'm misunderstanding it.\n\n\nJack can clean a yacht in 12 hours, so his work rate is \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\) of the job per hour. On this day, Jack completes two-thirds of the work, leaving one-third of the work for Jill. Jill's cleaning rate is 5% of Jack's rate, which is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Jill's rate} = 0.05 \\times \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{1}{240} \\, \\text{of the job per hour}.\n\\]\n\nThe remaining work is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\). The time it takes Jill to finish this remaining work is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Work}}{\\text{Rate}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}}{\\frac{1}{240}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 240 = 80 \\, \\text{hours}.\n\\]\n\nHowever, none of the provided options (A) 4, (B) 8, (C) 22, (D) 50, (E) 20) match the calculated result of 80 hours. Despite multiple recalculations and alternative approaches, the result consistently yields 80 hours. This suggests either an issue with the problem's options or a misinterpretation of the question. Based on the calculations, the correct answer is **80 hours**, but since it is not listed, no valid option can be selected.\n\nAnswer: None of the provided options match the calculated result.",
