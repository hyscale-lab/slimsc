      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this algebra problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question is: What should come in place of the question mark (?) in the equation a\u00b2 - b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2 (?) = (a - b)\u00b2. The options are A to E, with E being none of these.\n\nHmm, I think I need to find the expression that, when multiplied by (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2), gives (a - b)\u00b2. Alternatively, maybe it's a division or something else. Wait, the way it's written is a bit unclear. Let me parse the equation correctly.\n\nWait, the equation is written as a\u00b2 minus (b\u00b2 divided by (a + b) squared) multiplied by the question mark equals (a - b) squared. So, maybe it's (a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2]) multiplied by ? equals (a - b)\u00b2.\n\nOr perhaps, the question mark is in the denominator. Wait, the way it's written is a bit ambiguous. Let me try to structure it.\n\nWait, the equation is: (a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2)) multiplied by ? equals (a - b)\u00b2.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n(a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2]) * ? = (a - b)\u00b2.\n\nSo, we're solving for ?. Let me write that as:\n\n? = (a - b)\u00b2 / (a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2]).\n\nHmm, okay. Let me compute both numerator and denominator step by step.\n\nFirst, the numerator is (a - b)\u00b2, which is a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2.\n\nThe denominator is a\u00b2 minus (b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2). Let me compute a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2/(a + b)^2).\n\nWait, maybe it's better to combine these terms into a single fraction. Let me find a common denominator for the terms in the denominator.\n\nSo, the denominator is a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2]. Let's express a\u00b2 as a\u00b2*(a + b)\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2, so we can combine them.\n\nSo,\n\nDenominator = [a\u00b2*(a + b)^2 - b\u00b2] / (a + b)^2.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. Let me write a\u00b2 as (a\u00b2 * (a + b)^2 ) / (a + b)^2. So,\n\nDenominator = [ (a\u00b2*(a + b)^2 ) - b\u00b2 ] / (a + b)^2.\n\nBut that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can factor the denominator.\n\nWait, the denominator is a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2]. Let me denote this as D.\n\nSo,\n\nD = a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2]\n\nTo combine these terms, I'll write a\u00b2 as [a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 ] / (a + b)^2, so:\n\nD = [a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2] / (a + b)^2.\n\nLet me compute the numerator of D: a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2.\n\nFirst, expand (a + b)^2: that's a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\na\u00b2 (a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2) = a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2.\n\nSubtracting b\u00b2 gives:\n\na^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2 - b\u00b2.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to approach this problem. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can manipulate the equation to solve for ?. Let me write it again.\n\nWe have:\n\n(a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2]) * ? = (a - b)^2.\n\nSo, ? = (a - b)^2 / [a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2/(a + b)^2)].\n\nLet me compute the denominator first. Let me find a common denominator for the two terms in the denominator.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 is equal to [a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 ] / (a + b)^2.\n\nSo,\n\nDenominator = [a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2 ] / (a + b)^2.\n\nSo, the entire expression for ? becomes:\n\n? = (a - b)^2 * (a + b)^2 / [ a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2 ]\n\nWait, because the denominator is [ ... ] / (a + b)^2, so when you divide by it, it's the same as multiplying by (a + b)^2.\n\nSo,\n\n? = (a - b)^2 * (a + b)^2 / [ a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2 ]\n\nNow, let me compute the denominator in the denominator (the denominator of the denominator, which is the denominator of the denominator expression).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to compute the denominator again.\n\nDenominator = a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2].\n\nLet me compute this as a single fraction:\n\nDenominator = [a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2 ] / (a + b)^2.\n\nSo, the denominator of the big fraction is [a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2].\n\nSo, substituting back into ?:\n\n? = (a - b)^2 * (a + b)^2 / [ a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2 ].\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor the denominator in the denominator.\n\nLet me compute a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2.\n\nLet me expand (a + b)^2: a^2 + 2ab + b^2.\n\nSo,\n\na\u00b2 (a^2 + 2ab + b^2) = a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2.\n\nSubtracting b^2 gives:\n\na^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2 - b^2.\n\nHmm, that's a fourth-degree polynomial. Not sure if it factors nicely.\n\nWait, maybe I can factor this expression. Let me see.\n\na^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2 - b^2.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor by grouping.\n\nGroup terms as (a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2) - b^2.\n\nThe first three terms can be factored:\n\na^2 (a^2 + 2ab + b^2) = a^2 (a + b)^2.\n\nSo, the expression becomes a^2 (a + b)^2 - b^2.\n\nWait, that's the same as the denominator in the denominator. So, that's [a^2 (a + b)^2 - b^2].\n\nHmm, maybe I can factor this as a difference of squares. Because a^2 (a + b)^2 is a square, and b^2 is another square.\n\nSo, [a (a + b)]^2 - (b)^2.\n\nWhich is a difference of squares: [a(a + b) - b][a(a + b) + b].\n\nLet me compute each part.\n\nFirst term: a(a + b) - b = a^2 + ab - b = a^2 + b(a - 1).\n\nWait, perhaps that's not the right approach. Let me compute it again.\n\nWait, a(a + b) is a^2 + ab. Subtracting b gives a^2 + ab - b.\n\nHmm, that doesn't seem to factor neatly. Let me compute each bracket.\n\nFirst bracket: a(a + b) - b = a^2 + ab - b.\n\nSecond bracket: a(a + b) + b = a^2 + ab + b.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is not the best approach. Let me think of another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor the denominator a^2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 as a product of two terms.\n\nWait, let me try to write it as:\n\n[a (a + b)]^2 - (b)^2 = [a(a + b) - b][a(a + b) + b].\n\nYes, that's correct because it's a difference of squares.\n\nSo, a^2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 = [a(a + b) - b][a(a + b) + b].\n\nNow, let me compute each factor:\n\nFirst factor: a(a + b) - b = a\u00b2 + ab - b.\n\nSecond factor: a(a + b) + b = a\u00b2 + ab + b.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Let me see.\n\nWait, let me go back to the expression for ?.\n\n? = (a - b)^2 (a + b)^2 / [a^2 (a + b)^2 - b^2].\n\nWhich is:\n\n? = (a - b)^2 (a + b)^2 / [ (a(a + b) - b)(a(a + b) + b) ) ]\n\nWait, perhaps I can write this as:\n\n? = [ (a - b)^2 (a + b)^2 ] / [ (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b) ) ]\n\nHmm, not seeing an obvious simplification. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I can factor the denominator a^2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 another way.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that a^2 (a + b)^2 = [a (a + b)]^2, so the denominator is [a(a + b)]^2 - (b)^2.\n\nWhich is a difference of squares, so it factors into [a(a + b) - b][a(a + b) + b].\n\nSo, denominator becomes [a^2 + ab - b][a^2 + ab + b].\n\nHmm. So, putting it all together, ? is:\n\n? = (a - b)^2 (a + b)^2 / [ (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b) ) ]\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I should try plugging in some numbers to see which option works.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can find a better approach. Let me try to write the equation differently.\n\nThe original equation is:\n\n(a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2) * ? = (a - b)^2.\n\nWait, let me think about this. Let me compute the denominator in the original expression.\n\nWait, (a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 ]) is the same as [a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2 ] / (a + b)^2.\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n[ a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2 ] / (a + b)^2 multiplied by ? equals (a - b)^2.\n\nSo, rearranged:\n\n? = (a - b)^2 * (a + b)^2 / [ a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2 ]\n\nHmm, that's the same as before. Maybe I can write this as:\n\n? = (a - b)^2 (a + b)^2 / [ (a(a + b))^2 - b^2 ]\n\nWait, that's the same as [ (a^2 - b^2)^2 ] / [ (a^2 (a + b)^2) - b^2 ].\n\nWait, no, wait: (a - b)^2 (a + b)^2 is (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)^2.\n\nSo, ? = (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)^2 / [a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 ].\n\nHmm. Let me compute the denominator:\n\na\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 = a\u00b2(a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2) - b^2 = a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2 - b^2.\n\nWait, maybe I can factor this as (a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2) - b^2.\n\nWhich is a^2 (a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2) - b^2 = a^2 (a + b)^2 - b^2.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor this denominator as (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b).\n\nWait, let's check: (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b) = (a^2 + ab)^2 - (b)^2.\n\nWhich is a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2 - b^2. That's correct.\n\nSo, denominator is (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b).\n\nNow, the numerator is (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)^2 = (a - b)^2 (a + b)^2.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\n? = [ (a - b)^2 (a + b)^2 ] / [ (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b) ) ]\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Let me see if the denominator factors can be expressed in terms of (a - b) or (a + b).\n\nWait, let me look at (a^2 + ab - b). Can I factor this?\n\nLet me factor out an a: a(a + b) - b. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as a^2 + ab - b = a(a + b) - b.\n\nNot seeing a clear factor here. Alternatively, perhaps I can see if (a^2 + ab - b) is a multiple of (a - b) or (a + b).\n\nLet me try plugging in a = b. If a = b, then (a^2 + a^2 - a) = 2a^2 - a. Hmm, but when a = b, (a - b) becomes zero, so maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can perform polynomial division. Let me divide (a^2 + ab - b) by (a - b). Wait, let me try that.\n\nDivide a^2 + ab - b by (a - b).\n\nSet it up:\n\nDividing a^2 + ab - b by a - b.\n\nUsing polynomial long division.\n\na - b ) a^2 + ab - b\n\nFirst term: a^2 divided by a gives a.\n\nMultiply (a - b) by a: a^2 - ab.\n\nSubtract from the dividend:\n\n(a^2 + ab - b) - (a^2 - ab) = 0 + 2ab - b.\n\nNow, bring down the next term (but there are no more terms). Now, the remainder is 2ab - b.\n\nSo, the division gives a with a remainder of (2ab - b). So, (a^2 + ab - b) = (a - b) * a + (2ab - b).\n\nNot a clean division, so (a - b) is not a factor of (a^2 + ab - b). So perhaps that approach won't help.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Let me consider the initial equation again.\n\nThe equation is (a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 ]) * ? = (a - b)^2.\n\nLet me compute a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 ] first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write a\u00b2 as [a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 ] / (a + b)^2, so:\n\na\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 ] = [a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2 ] / (a + b)^2.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n[ a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2 ] / (a + b)^2 * ? = (a - b)^2.\n\nSo, rearranged, ? = (a - b)^2 * (a + b)^2 / [ a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2 ].\n\nWait, perhaps I can factor the denominator as a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2 - b^2.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I can write the denominator as a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2 - b^2 = a^4 + 2a^3 b + (a^2 b^2 - b^2).\n\nWhich is a^4 + 2a^3 b + b^2 (a^2 - 1). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor this as (a^2 + something)(a^2 + something else). Let me try.\n\nLooking for factors of the form (a^2 + m a + n)(a^2 + p a + q).\n\nExpanding, it would be a^4 + (m + p) a^3 + (n + q + m p) a^2 + (m q + n p) a + n q.\n\nComparing to a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2 - b^2.\n\nSo, matching coefficients:\n\n1. Coefficient of a^4: 1 \u2192 correct.\n2. Coefficient of a^3: m + p = 2b.\n3. Coefficient of a^2: n + q + m p = b^2.\n4. Coefficient of a: m q + n p = 0.\n5. Constant term: n q = -b^2.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but let's see if we can find m, p, n, q.\n\nFrom equation 5: n q = -b^2.\n\nPossible options: n = b, q = -b \u2192 n q = -b^2. Or n = -b, q = b.\n\nLet me try n = b, q = -b.\n\nThen equation 4: m*(-b) + p*(b) = 0 \u2192 -m b + p b = 0 \u2192 -m + p = 0 \u2192 p = m.\n\nFrom equation 2: m + p = 2b. Since p = m, 2m = 2b \u2192 m = b, p = b.\n\nThen equation 3: n + q + m p = b + (-b) + (b)(b) \u2192 0 + b\u00b2 = b\u00b2. Which holds.\n\nSo, the factors are (a^2 + m a + n) = (a^2 + b a + b), and (a^2 + p a + q) = (a^2 + b a - b).\n\nWait, so the denominator factors into (a^2 + a b + b) (a^2 + a b - b).\n\nSo, denominator becomes (a^2 + ab + b)(a^2 + ab - b).\n\nSo, going back to ?:\n\n? = (a - b)^2 (a + b)^2 / [ (a^2 + ab + b)(a^2 + ab - b) ) ]\n\nHmm, not seeing a cancellation here. Let me try to see if any terms in the numerator and denominator can be simplified.\n\nThe numerator is (a - b)^2 (a + b)^2. The denominator is (a^2 + ab + b)(a^2 + ab - b).\n\nWait, perhaps I can write (a^2 + ab + b) as (a^2 + ab + b) = a(a + b) + b.\n\nNot sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the denominator in terms of (a + b) and (a - b).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the denominator as (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b) = (a^2 + ab)^2 - b^2.\n\nWhich is (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b) = (a^2 + ab)^2 - (b)^2.\n\nHmm. So, the denominator is (a^2 + ab)^2 - b^2.\n\nWait, but the numerator is (a^2 - b^2)^2.\n\nSo, perhaps I can write the entire expression as:\n\n? = (a^2 - b^2)^2 / [ (a^2 + ab)^2 - b^2 ].\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor the denominator further.\n\nWait, the denominator is (a^2 + ab)^2 - b^2 = [ (a^2 + ab) - b ] [ (a^2 + ab) + b ].\n\nWhich is (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b), as we had before.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator and denominator differently.\n\nWait, numerator is (a^2 - b^2)^2 = (a - b)^2 (a + b)^2.\n\nDenominator is (a^2 + ab)^2 - b^2 = (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b).\n\nWait, perhaps I can write (a^2 + ab) as a(a + b). So, denominator becomes [ a(a + b) - b ] [ a(a + b) + b ].\n\nSo,\n\nDenominator = [ a(a + b) - b ] [ a(a + b) + b ].\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\n[ a^2 + ab - b ][ a^2 + ab + b ].\n\nHmm. Now, looking for any possible cancellation between numerator and denominator.\n\nThe numerator is (a - b)^2 (a + b)^2.\n\nThe denominator is (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b).\n\nNot seeing a direct cancellation, perhaps I should try another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express the denominator as (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b) = (a^2 + ab)^2 - b^2.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can factor this differently. Alternatively, maybe I can factor the denominator as (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b) = (a(a + b) - b)(a(a + b) + b).\n\nHmm. So, perhaps I can write the denominator as (a(a + b) - b)(a(a + b) + b).\n\nSo, the denominator is [ a(a + b) - b ][ a(a + b) + b ].\n\nHmm. Now, let's see if the numerator can be expressed in terms that would cancel with any of these.\n\nThe numerator is (a - b)^2 (a + b)^2.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write (a + b)^2 as (a + b)(a + b), and (a - b)^2 as (a - b)(a - b).\n\nNot sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor the denominator in another way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the denominator as (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b).\n\nLet me factor each term:\n\na^2 + ab - b = a(a + b) - b.\n\nSimilarly, a^2 + ab + b = a(a + b) + b.\n\nHmm. Now, let me look at the numerator again: (a - b)^2 (a + b)^2.\n\nWait, maybe I can factor the numerator as (a - b)^2 (a + b)^2 = (a^2 - b^2)^2.\n\nHmm. Let me think, perhaps I can write the denominator as (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b) = (a^2 + ab)^2 - b^2.\n\nWhich is the same as (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b).\n\nHmm. So, perhaps I can write:\n\n? = (a^2 - b^2)^2 / [ (a^2 + ab)^2 - b^2 ].\n\nHmm, but I'm not seeing a clear simplification. Maybe I should try substituting specific values for a and b to test the options.\n\nLet me pick a = 2 and b = 1.\n\nCompute the left side and right side of the equation to find ?.\n\nSo, a = 2, b = 1.\n\nLeft side: (a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2) * ? = (2^2 - (1^2)/(2 + 1)^2) * ? = (4 - 1/9) * ? = (36/9 - 1/9) * ? = (35/9) * ?.\n\nRight side: (a - b)^2 = (2 - 1)^2 = 1^2 = 1.\n\nSo, equation becomes (35/9) * ? = 1 \u2192 ? = 9/35.\n\nNow, let's compute each option with a=2 and b=1 to see which gives 9/35.\n\nOption A: (a + b)(a - b) = (2 + 1)(2 - 1) = 3 * 1 = 3. Not 9/35.\n\nOption B: (a - b)^2 = (2 -1)^2 = 1. No.\n\nOption C: (a + b)^2 = (3)^2 =9. No.\n\nOption D: a^3 + b^3 =8 +1=9. No.\n\nOption E: None of these.\n\nSo, since none of the options A-D give 9/35, the correct answer is E.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my substitution. Because maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, when a=2 and b=1, the denominator in the initial expression is a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2/(a+b)^2) = 4 - (1/9) = 35/9. So, 35/9 multiplied by ? equals (a - b)^2 which is 1. So, ? is (1)/(35/9) = 9/35.\n\nNow, let's check each option:\n\nA) (a + b)(a - b) = 3 *1=3 \u2192 3. Not 9/35.\n\nB) (a - b)^2=1 \u2192 1. No.\n\nC) (a + b)^2=9 \u2192 9. No.\n\nD) a^3 + b^3=8 +1=9 \u21929. No.\n\nE) None of these. So, the correct answer is E.\n\n\nTo solve the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\left(a^2 - \\frac{b^2}{(a + b)^2}\\right) \\cdot ? = (a - b)^2\n\\]\n\nwe aim to find the expression that replaces the question mark (?).\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the denominator\nThe term \\(a^2 - \\frac{b^2}{(a + b)^2}\\) can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[\na^2 - \\frac{b^2}{(a + b)^2} = \\frac{a^2 (a + b)^2 - b^2}{(a + b)^2}\n\\]\n\nExpanding \\(a^2 (a + b)^2\\):\n\n\\[\na^2 (a + b)^2 = a^2 (a^2 + 2ab + b^2) = a^4 + 2a^3b + a^2b^2\n\\]\n\nSubtracting \\(b^2\\):\n\n\\[\na^4 + 2a^3b + a^2b^2 - b^2\n\\]\n\nThus, the denominator becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a^4 + 2a^3b + a^2b^2 - b^2}{(a + b)^2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Solve for ?\nRewriting the original equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a^4 + 2a^3b + a^2b^2 - b^2}{(a + b)^2} \\cdot ? = (a - b)^2\n\\]\n\nRearranging for ?:\n\n\\[\n? = \\frac{(a - b)^2}{\\frac{a^4 + 2a^3b + a^2b^2 - b^2}{(a + b)^2}}\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n? = \\frac{(a - b)^2 (a + b)^2}{a^4 + 2a^3b + a^2b^2 - b^2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor the denominator\nThe denominator \\(a^4 + 2a^3b + a^2b^2 - b^2\\) can be factored as:\n\n\\[\na^4 + 2a^3b + a^2b^2 - b^2 = (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b)\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\n? = \\frac{(a - b)^2 (a + b)^2}{(a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b)}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Test the options\nTo verify the correct option, substitute specific values for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).
