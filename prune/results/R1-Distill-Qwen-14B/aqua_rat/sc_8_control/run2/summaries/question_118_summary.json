      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. It says there's a paper in a square form, each side is 20 cm. Then, two semicircles are drawn on opposite sides as diameters. These semicircles are cut down, and I need to find the area of the remaining paper. The options are A to E, with some numbers around 8.7 something. Hmm.\n\nWait, wait, the square is 20 cm on each side. So the area of the square is straightforward. Area of a square is side squared. So 20 cm times 20 cm is 400 cm\u00b2. Got that.\n\nNow, the problem mentions two semicircles. They're drawn on opposite sides as diameters. So I imagine the square, and on two opposite sides, each of those sides is the diameter of a semicircle. So, for example, maybe on the top and bottom edges, each 20 cm, so each semicircle has a diameter of 20 cm.\n\nWait, but when they say they are cut down, do they mean that the semicircles are removed from the square? So the remaining area is the square minus the areas of the two semicircles. Or perhaps, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. Oh, no, wait, each semicircle is drawn on opposite sides as diameters. So each semicircle is attached to the square, but when you cut them down, you remove those parts from the square. So the remaining paper would be the square minus the areas of the two semicircles.\n\nBut wait, each semicircle is on a side of the square. So each has a diameter of 20 cm. The radius would be half of that, so 10 cm. The area of a full circle is \u03c0r\u00b2. So a semicircle would be (\u03c0r\u00b2)/2. Since there are two semicircles, each with radius 10 cm, the total area removed would be 2 * (\u03c0*(10)^2)/2. Simplify that: the 2 and the denominator 2 cancel out, so it's \u03c0*(10)^2, which is 100\u03c0 cm\u00b2.\n\nSo the remaining area is the area of the square minus the area of the two semicircles. That's 400 - 100\u03c0.\n\nBut wait, the options are around 8.7 something. That's much smaller than 400. Did I get something wrong? Oh wait, wait, the options are in what unit? Oh, the problem says the side is 20 cm, so the area in cm\u00b2. But the options are like 8.7 something. That's way too small. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the side is 20 cm, but the area of the square is 20*20=400 cm\u00b2. The area of the two semicircles is 100\u03c0 \u2248 314.16 cm\u00b2. So 400 minus 314 is about 85.84 cm\u00b2. But the options are around 8.7. Hmm, that's not matching. Did I misinterpret the problem?\n\nWait, maybe the side is 20 units, but perhaps the question is about the area of the remaining part after cutting down the semicircles, but maybe it's not the entire square. Or perhaps I misunderstood the setup. Let me re-read.\n\nThe paper is square, 20 cm each side. Two semicircles are drawn on its opposite sides as diameters. If these semicircles are cut down, what is the area of the remaining paper?\n\nWait, maybe the semicircles are drawn outward from the square, not as part of the square. So when they are cut down, they're removed from the square. So the remaining area is the square minus the two semicircles.\n\nWait, but that would still be 400 - 100\u03c0 \u2248 85.84 cm\u00b2, which isn't matching the options. So maybe I'm wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the semicircles are not on the sides, but on the top and bottom edges as diameters. So each semicircle has a diameter of 20 cm. So same as before. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the paper isn't a square but a circle, but no, the question says it's square. Alternatively, maybe the semicircles are drawn on the same side? No, the problem says opposite sides.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the area. Let me think again. The area of a semicircle is (1/2)*\u03c0*r\u00b2. For each semicircle, r=10 cm. So one semicircle is 0.5 * \u03c0 * 100 = 50\u03c0. Two semicircles would be 100\u03c0. So the area removed is 100\u03c0, so 400 - 100\u03c0.\n\nWait, but 100\u03c0 is approximately 314.159. So 400 - 314.159 is about 85.84 cm\u00b2. But the options are 8.7 something. That's ten times smaller. Oh! Wait a second, did I mess up the units? The side is 20 cm, but perhaps the area is 20 cm\u00b2? No, that's not possible. The problem says each side is 20 cm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not about the area but about the perimeter? Or maybe it's about the area of the figure that's left, but perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the semicircles are drawn on the opposite edges, but not on the same plane. Wait, maybe the square is three-dimensional, but that's not indicated. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the two semicircles are drawn on the same side, but that doesn't make sense with \"opposite as diameters.\" No, opposite sides would imply different edges.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about the area after cutting along the semicircles, creating a shape that's the square minus the two semicircles. So the area is 400 - 100\u03c0. But 100\u03c0 is about 314.159, so 400 - 314.159 is approximately 85.84 cm\u00b2. But the options are all about 8.7, so perhaps the side is 2 cm, not 20 cm? Because 2^2 is 4, and two semicircles would be area \u03c0*(1)^2 each, so two would be 2\u03c0. 4 - 2\u03c0 \u2248 4 - 6.28 is negative, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, no.\n\nWait, perhaps the square's side is 20 units, but when I subtract 100\u03c0, it's 400 - 314.159 \u2248 85.84, which is approximately 85.84. But the options are 8.7 something, which is way off. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not about cutting the semicircles, but perhaps it's about the area of the remaining part after some other operation. Maybe the semicircles are drawn on opposite corners? No, the problem says opposite sides as diameters.\n\nWait, another thought. Maybe the semicircles are drawn on the same side, but as part of the same diameter. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the two semicircles are drawn on the same side but overlapping? No, the problem says opposite sides.\n\nWait, maybe the square is not 20 cm per side, but the diameter of the semicircles is 20 cm. Oh wait, the semicircles are drawn on opposite sides as diameters. So each side is the diameter, so each semicircle's diameter is 20 cm. So radius 10 cm. So area of each semicircle is (1/2)\u03c0*(10)^2 = 50\u03c0. Two of them would be 100\u03c0. So area removed is 100\u03c0, remaining area is 400 - 100\u03c0 \u2248 400 - 314.159 \u2248 85.84 cm\u00b2. But the options are 8.7 something. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the square is being folded or something. Wait, the question says, \"these semicircles are cut down.\" Maybe the semicircles are being cut from the square, so the remaining area is the square minus the two semicircles. But that's what I thought before.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is in another language, and the translation is a bit off. For example, maybe \"cut down\" doesn't mean remove, but something else. Alternatively, perhaps the area is of the shape after cutting along the semicircles, but not removing them. But that would leave the area as the square plus the two semicircles, which doesn't make sense with the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about the perimeter. Wait, but the question is about area.\n\nWait, maybe the square is 20 cm in perimeter. No, the problem states the side is 20 cm, so perimeter is 80 cm. But the area would then be (20)^2=400 cm\u00b2. That doesn't help.\n\nWait, perhaps the paper is 20 cm in length and 20 cm in width, but the question is about the area of the remaining part after cutting semicircles from both ends. But that's a different shape. For example, if the paper is a rectangle (but it's a square) with two semicircles at each end, making a shape like a capsule. But in that case, the area would be the area of the rectangle minus the area of the two semicircles. Wait, no, because the semicircles are on the ends, so the area would be the area of the rectangle plus the area of the two semicircles (which would make a circle). But the problem says the semicircles are cut down, so perhaps you're removing them.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the square's opposite sides have semicircles as diameters. So perhaps the two semicircles are on the top and bottom edges. So when you cut them, you remove those semicircles from the square. So the remaining area is 400 - 100\u03c0.\n\nBut wait, 400 - 100\u03c0 is about 85.84 cm\u00b2, which is not matching the options. So perhaps the question is not about 20 cm sides but 20 units in diameter? Wait, no, the problem says the square is 20 cm on each side.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the area of the part that's left after cutting along the semicircles, but not removing them. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about the area of the overlapping region, but that's not indicated.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the square is 20 cm in perimeter, so each side is 5 cm. Because 4*5=20. Then the area would be 25 cm\u00b2. Each semicircle would have a diameter of 5 cm, radius 2.5 cm. Area of each semicircle is (1/2)*\u03c0*(2.5)^2 = (1/2)*\u03c0*6.25 = 3.125\u03c0. Two semicircles would be 6.25\u03c0. So area remaining is 25 - 6.25\u03c0. Let's compute that: 6.25 * 3.1416 \u2248 19.635. So 25 - 19.635 \u2248 5.365. That's still not matching the options.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the options again. They are 8.75, 8.79, 8.71, etc. So about 8.7 something. Maybe the area is 100*(4 - \u03c0), because 4 is 20/5, but that's a stretch.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the area of the remaining part, but I've made a miscalculation. Let's recompute 400 - 100\u03c0. 100\u03c0 is approximately 314.159. So 400 - 314.159 is approximately 85.841 cm\u00b2. So approximately 85.84 cm\u00b2. But none of the options are near 85. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the semicircles are drawn on the same side, but I thought they were on opposite sides. Wait, the question says two semicircles are drawn on opposite sides as diameters. So each has a diameter of 20 cm, but they are on opposite sides. So each is a semicircle attached to the square. But when you cut them, you remove those semicircular areas from the square. So the remaining area is the square minus the two semicircles.\n\nWait, but perhaps the semicircles are drawn inside the square. So each semicircle is inside the square, with their diameters on opposite sides. So for example, the semicircle on the top side is inside the square, curving downward, and the one on the bottom side is inside, curving upward. So the area of the remaining part would be the square minus the area of the two semicircles.\n\nWait, but in that case, the area would still be 400 - 100\u03c0, which is about 85.84. So that's not matching the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the semicircles are drawn on the same side, but I'm not sure. Let me think. Suppose the square has two semicircles drawn on the same side, but as diameters. That would mean each semicircle has a diameter of 20 cm, but they are on the same side. So perhaps they are overlapping or something. But that doesn't make much sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the two semicircles are drawn on the same side, but one is on the top half and the other on the bottom half, but that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the semicircles are drawn on adjacent sides, but the question says opposite sides.\n\nWait, maybe the square is divided into two parts by the semicircles, and the area being asked is the overlapping region. But that's not indicated.\n\nHmm, this is getting confusing. Let me try a different approach. Let's compute the options numerically. The options are:\n\nA)8.75\n\nB)8.79\n\nC)8.75\n\nD)8.71\n\nE)8.72\n\nSo all options are around 8.7. Let me compute 400 - 100\u03c0:\n\n400 - 100 * 3.1415926535 = 400 - 314.15926535 = 85.84073465 cm\u00b2.\n\nSo approximately 85.84. None of the options are close to that. So perhaps the problem is not about the area of the square minus the two semicircles. Maybe it's about the area of the region that's left, but perhaps the problem is about the area of the region where the two semicircles overlap, but that doesn't seem to fit the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the area of the remaining part after cutting along the semicircles. Maybe the figure becomes a shape with two semicircular notches, and we need to find the area of that shape.\n\nWait, but that would still be the square minus the two semicircles. So same result as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the square is 20 cm in perimeter. So each side is 5 cm. Then area is 25 cm\u00b2. The two semicircles would each have a diameter of 5 cm, so radius 2.5 cm. Each semicircle area is (1/2)*\u03c0*(2.5)^2 = (1/2)*\u03c0*6.25 = 3.125\u03c0. Two semicircles would be 6.25\u03c0. So remaining area is 25 - 6.25\u03c0. Let's compute that: 6.25 * 3.1416 \u2248 19.635. So 25 - 19.635 \u2248 5.365 cm\u00b2. Still not matching.\n\nHmm, this is perplexing. Maybe the question is in another unit, like the side is 20 mm, but that would give 4 cm\u00b2, which is still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the side is 20 units, but the area is in terms of \u03c0. Let's see. 400 - 100\u03c0 is approximately 85.84, but the options are around 8.7. So perhaps the side is 2 units, making the area 4. Then the two semicircles would have area (1/2)*\u03c0*(1)^2 * 2 = \u03c0. So remaining area is 4 - \u03c0 \u2248 0.8584. That's about 0.86, not 8.7.\n\nWait, perhaps the side is 20 cm, but the semicircles are on the same side, each with diameter 10 cm. Because if each semicircle has a diameter of 10 cm, then radius is 5 cm. Each semicircle area is (1/2)*\u03c0*(5)^2 = 12.5\u03c0. Two of them would be 25\u03c0. So remaining area is 400 - 25\u03c0 \u2248 400 - 78.54 \u2248 321.46. Still not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the semicircles are drawn on the same side but overlapping. So maybe the combined area is not just adding them. But the problem states two semicircles on opposite sides, so probably not.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the area of the region where the two semicircles intersect. But that's a more complex calculation. Let me think. The two semicircles are on opposite sides, each with diameter 20 cm. So they're on opposite edges of the square. The area of their intersection would be a lens-shaped region. But that's more complicated to compute.\n\nWait, let me visualize the square with two semicircles on opposite sides. The semicircles are on the top and bottom edges, each with diameter 20 cm. So each semicircle is on the top and bottom, but they don't intersect because they are on opposite sides. So their areas don't overlap. So the total area removed is 100\u03c0, so remaining area is 400 - 100\u03c0 \u2248 85.84 cm\u00b2. Still, no match with the options.\n\nWait, maybe the semicircles are on adjacent sides. Like left and right edges, each with diameter 20 cm. Then, the semicircles would be on the left and right sides, each of 20 cm. So again, their areas don't overlap. So the remaining area is still 400 - 100\u03c0.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is not about the area but something else. Wait, maybe the problem is about the area of the part that is left after cutting along the semicircles, but perhaps the semicircles are not removed. But that doesn't make sense with the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about the area of the part that's cut down, but the question says, \"the area of the remaining paper.\"\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me compute 400 - 100\u03c0 exactly. 100\u03c0 is approximately 314.159265. So 400 - 314.159265 = 85.840735 cm\u00b2. So approximately 85.84 cm\u00b2. But the options are around 8.7. So perhaps the problem is in a different unit or I'm missing a decimal point.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the area in terms of the radius, but that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, perhaps the semicircles are not on the square but on a circle. No, the question says the paper is square.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the square is 20 cm in perimeter, so each side is 5 cm. Then area is 25 cm\u00b2. The two semicircles would each have a diameter of 5 cm, so radius 2.5 cm. Each semicircle area is (1/2)\u03c0*(2.5)^2 = (1/2)*\u03c0*6.25 = 3.125\u03c0. Two semicircles would be 6.25\u03c0 \u2248 19.635 cm\u00b2. So remaining area is 25 - 19.635 \u2248 5.365 cm\u00b2. Still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the side is 20 units, but the area is 20 cm\u00b2. So side length would be sqrt(20) \u22484.472 cm. But that complicates things, and I don't think that's the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the area of the overlapping region of the two semicircles. But as I thought earlier, if the semicircles are on opposite sides, their areas don't overlap. So the overlapping area would be zero. So that can't be the case.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Let me look for another approach. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the area of the semicircles. Wait, each semicircle has a diameter of 20 cm, so radius 10 cm. Area is (1/2)*\u03c0*r\u00b2. So one semicircle is 0.5 * \u03c0 * 100 = 50\u03c0. Two of them would be 100\u03c0. So that part is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the area of the region that is left after cutting along the semicircles, but perhaps the shape is different. For example, if you cut along the semicircles, you're left with a shape that has a square and two semicircular indentations. So the area would be the square minus the two semicircles, which is 400 - 100\u03c0 \u224885.84 cm\u00b2. But the options are way smaller.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the area of the part that's cut, not the remaining. But the question says the area of the remaining paper, so that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and the side is 2 cm instead of 20 cm. Let's try that. If each side is 2 cm, the area is 4 cm\u00b2. The two semicircles would have diameter 2 cm, radius 1 cm. Each semicircle area is (1/2)*\u03c0*(1)^2 = 0.5\u03c0. Two of them would be \u03c0. So remaining area is 4 - \u03c0 \u2248 4 - 3.1416 \u2248 0.8584 cm\u00b2. That's about 0.86 cm\u00b2, which is not matching the options either.\n\nWait, another approach. Perhaps the square is 20 cm in perimeter, so each side is 5 cm. Then area is 25 cm\u00b2. The two semicircles would have diameter 5 cm, radius 2.5 cm. Area of each semicircle is (1/2)*\u03c0*(2.5)^2 = 3.125\u03c0. Two of them: 6.25\u03c0 \u224819.635. Remaining area: 25 -19.635\u22485.365. Still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the square is 20 cm in diagonal. So the side length would be 20 / sqrt(2) \u224814.142 cm. Then area is (14.142)^2 \u2248200 cm\u00b2. Each semicircle has diameter 14.142 cm, radius\u22487.071 cm. Area of each semicircle: 0.5 * \u03c0 * (7.071)^2 \u22480.5 * \u03c0 *50 \u224825\u03c0. Two of them: 50\u03c0\u2248157.08. Remaining area: 200 -157.08\u224842.92. Still not matching the options.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe the problem is written wrong or I'm misunderstanding the setup. Alternatively, perhaps the two semicircles are on the same side, but that doesn't make sense with opposite diameters.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the two semicircles are drawn on the same side, but on opposite ends. Like, one semicircle on the left end of the top side, and another on the right end. But that would complicate things, and I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two semicircles are on the same side, each with a diameter of 10 cm, so radius 5 cm. Then each semicircle area is (1/2)*\u03c0*25=12.5\u03c0. Two of them: 25\u03c0\u224878.54. Square area is 400, so remaining area\u2248400-78.54\u2248321.46. Still not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the square is 20 cm in diagonal. Wait, no, I tried that earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the area of the square that's left after the two semicircles are cut out, but the semicircles are overlapping. But earlier I thought that if they are on opposite sides, their areas don't overlap. So the area removed is 100\u03c0. So remaining area is 400 - 100\u03c0\u224885.84 cm\u00b2.\n\nBut none of the options are close to that. So perhaps the problem is about the area in a different way. Maybe the problem is about the area of the part that's not cut. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the area of the semicircular regions, but that would be 100\u03c0\u2248314.16, which is also not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the area of the square that's not covered by the semicircles. So same as before, 400-100\u03c0\u224885.84 cm\u00b2.\n\nWait, maybe the options are in a different unit, like meters. 85.84 cm\u00b2 is 0.008584 m\u00b2, but that's 0.008584, which is about 0.0086, not 8.7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the side is 20 inches, but that's unlikely given the options.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute the numerical value of 400 - 100\u03c0. Let me do that precisely. 100\u03c0 is approximately 314.15926535. So 400 - 314.15926535 = 85.84073465 cm\u00b2. So approximately 85.84 cm\u00b2.\n\nBut the options are all around 8.7, which is exactly 10 times smaller. So perhaps the side is 2 cm instead of 20 cm. Let me try that. If side is 2 cm, area is 4 cm\u00b2. The two semicircles would each have diameter 2 cm, radius 1 cm. Each semicircle area is (1/2)*\u03c0*1\u00b2 = \u03c0/2. Two of them: \u03c0. So remaining area is 4 - \u03c0 \u2248 0.8584 cm\u00b2. Which is about 0.86 cm\u00b2, which isn't matching the options either.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the area of the paper after cutting, but the semicircles are not on the square's sides but on the edges of a circle. But the problem says the paper is square.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck here. Maybe the problem is about the area of the region that's left after cutting, but I'm not seeing it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the area is zero, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, another angle: maybe the two semicircles are drawn on the same side, making a full circle. So each semicircle has a diameter of 20 cm, but together they make a full circle with radius 10 cm. So the area removed is \u03c0*(10)^2=100\u03c0. So same as before, remaining area 400 - 100\u03c0\u224885.84. So same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two semicircles are on the same side, but each has a diameter of 10 cm. So each semicircle area is (1/2)*\u03c0*(5)^2=12.5\u03c0. Two of them:25\u03c0. Remaining area 400 -25\u03c0\u2248400 -78.54\u2248321.46. Still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the area of the square after the semicircles are cut out, but the square is transformed into a different shape. For example, if the semicircles are cut from opposite sides, the remaining shape is a rectangle with two semicircular ends, but that's a cylinder's shape. But in 2D, perhaps it's a rectangle with two semicircles attached, but that would increase the area, not decrease it.\n\nWait, no, the question says the semicircles are cut down, so they are removed. So the area is reduced.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is a trick, and the area is the same as the two semicircles, but that would be 100\u03c0\u2248314.16, which doesn't match.\n\nWait, I'm really not getting this. Let me think about the options again. All options are around 8.7. 8.7 is approximately 27.9 divided by 3.2, but I don't know if that helps.\n\nWait, perhaps the area is (400 - 100\u03c0)/100, which would be 4 - \u03c0, which is about 0.8584. No, that's not 8.7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about the area of the remaining part in a different unit. For example, 85.84 cm\u00b2 is 0.8584 dm\u00b2 (since 1 dm =10 cm, 1 dm\u00b2=100 cm\u00b2). So 0.8584 dm\u00b2 is 85.84 cm\u00b2. Still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the area of the region that's left in a unit conversion. Like, 85.84 cm\u00b2 is 8584 mm\u00b2. But that doesn't help.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let me think about the problem again.\n\nThe problem says the paper is square, side 20 cm. Two semicircles are drawn on opposite sides as diameters. Then, these semicircles are cut down. What is the area of the remaining paper?\n\nSo the square is 20x20=400 cm\u00b2. Two semicircles, each with diameter 20 cm, so radius 10 cm. Each semicircle area is (1/2)*\u03c0*r\u00b2 = 0.5 * \u03c0 * 100=50\u03c0. Two semicircles: 100\u03c0. So area remaining is 400 - 100\u03c0 \u224885.84 cm\u00b2.\n\nBut the options are 8.7 something. So perhaps the problem has a typo, and the side is 2 cm instead of 20 cm. Let's see.\n\nIf side is 2 cm: area 4 cm\u00b2. Each semicircle diameter 2 cm, radius 1 cm. Area per semicircle: 0.5 * \u03c0 * 1\u00b2=0.5\u03c0. Two semicircles: \u03c0. Remaining area:4 - \u03c0 \u22480.8584 cm\u00b2. Still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the side is 20 mm, which is 2 cm. Then area is (2 cm)^2=4 cm\u00b2. Same as before.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is about the area of the paper after cutting, but the remaining paper is a circle. So perhaps the two semicircles are on opposite sides, and when you cut them, the remaining part is a circle. But how?\n\nWait, if the square is 20 cm on each side, and you cut out two semicircles from opposite sides, the remaining shape would be like a cylinder's cross-section. But that's 2D, so perhaps it's a rectangle with two semicircular ends, making a shape with area equal to the rectangle plus the two semicircles. But that's adding area, which would increase the area, not reduce it. So that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the remaining paper is a circle. But how would that happen? If you cut two semicircles from opposite sides, perhaps the remaining part is a circle. Let me think.\n\nWait, if the square is 20 cm per side, and you cut semicircles from the top and bottom, each with diameter 20 cm, then the remaining area would be the square minus the two semicircles. But that's 400 - 100\u03c0, not a circle.\n\nWait, perhaps the square is transformed into a circle after cutting. But that's not physically possible in this context.\n\nHmm. I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should consider that the problem is about the area of the overlapping region of the two semicircles. But in that case, the semicircles are on opposite sides, so they don't overlap. So the overlapping area is zero. So that can't be it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about the area of the part that's not removed, but the calculation still gives 85.84.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the options again. The options are A)8.75, B)8.79, C)8.75, D)8.71, E)8.72. So they are all approximately 8.75, which is close to 8.79, etc.\n\nWait, 8.75 is approximately 35/4. But I don't see the connection.\n\nWait, perhaps the area is 20 cm\u00b2, and the two semicircles have a diameter of 10 cm each. So radius 5 cm. Area of each semicircle is (1/2)*\u03c0*25=12.5\u03c0. Two of them:25\u03c0\u224878.54. So remaining area would be 20 -78.54= negative, which doesn't make sense.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe the problem is about the area of the part that's cut out, but the question says the remaining paper.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the area of the paper after cutting, but the semicircles are drawn on the same side, so they overlap. So the area removed is not 100\u03c0 but less. But how much less?\n\nWait, let me compute the area of two overlapping semicircles on the same side. For example, each semicircle has a diameter of 20 cm, so radius 10 cm. If they are on the same side, their centers are 20 cm apart, which is equal to the diameter. So the distance between centers is 20 cm, which is equal to twice the radius (since each radius is 10 cm). So the circles just touch each other at the ends, meaning no overlapping area. So the total area removed is 100\u03c0.\n\nBut if the semicircles are on the same side, but their diameters are on the same line, perhaps overlapping. Wait, perhaps the two semicircles are on the same side, each with diameter 20 cm, but overlapping. But that would require the centers to be closer than 20 cm apart, which isn't the case here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about a different shape. Maybe the paper is a square, and the two semicircles are drawn on adjacent corners, making a different shape. But the problem says opposite sides.\n\nHmm. I think I'm stuck. I'll have to proceed with the initial calculation, even though it doesn't match the options. Maybe the correct answer is approximately 85.84 cm\u00b2, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the area of the remaining part after the semicircles are cut, but the semicircles are only drawn on the same side, not opposite. So each semicircle has diameter 20 cm. So two semicircles on the same side would make a full circle. So area removed is \u03c0*(10)^2=100\u03c0. So remaining area is 400-100\u03c0\u224885.84. Still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the area of the region that's left after cutting along the semicircles, but perhaps the paper is folded. For example, if the square is folded along the semicircles, but that's getting into origami, which isn't indicated in the problem.\n\nHmm. I'm really not getting this. Maybe I should go with the initial calculation and see if any of the options match. But none of them do. So perhaps the problem is incorrectly stated, or I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the area of the remaining part after cutting, but the semicircles are not on the square's sides but on a circle. But the paper is square, so that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the two semicircles are drawn on the same side, but one is on the top half and the other on the bottom half, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the semicircles are drawn on the square's corners, but the problem says opposite sides.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the area of the square that's left after cutting along the semicircles, but the semicircles are only on one side. But the problem says opposite sides.\n\nHmm. I think I'll have to conclude that the correct area is 400 - 100\u03c0 \u224885.84 cm\u00b2, but since the options don't match, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the area of the paper that's left after cutting along the semicircles, but the calculation is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the area of the paper after cutting, but the semicircles are drawn on the same side, each with diameter 10 cm. So each semicircle has radius 5 cm, area 12.5\u03c0. Two of them:25\u03c0\u224878.54. So remaining area is 400-78.54\u2248321.46. Still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the semicircles are drawn on the same side, each with diameter 20 cm, but overlapping. But as I thought before, if the centers are 20 cm apart, the circles just touch, so no overlapping area. So the area removed is 100\u03c0.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the area of the remaining part after cutting, but the paper is not a square. For example, it's a rectangle. But the problem says it's square.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. I'll have to go with the initial calculation, even though it doesn't match the options. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the area of the part that's cut, which is 100\u03c0\u2248314.16, but that's not matching either.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is about the area of the square after cutting along the semicircles, but the semicircles are on adjacent sides. So the area would be the square minus the two semicircles, which are adjacent. But that doesn't change the calculation; the area is still 400 - 100\u03c0.\n\nHmm. I think I've tried all possible interpretations and none match the options. Perhaps the problem is incorrect, or I'm missing something. But given the options, the closest I can think of is that the area is 85.84, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the semicircles are drawn on the same side, but each has a diameter of 10 cm. So each semicircle has radius 5 cm. Area per semicircle: (1/2)*\u03c0*25=12.5\u03c0. Two of them:25\u03c0\u224878.54. Remaining area:400 -78.54\u2248321.46 cm\u00b2. Still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two semicircles are on the same side, each with diameter 10 cm, but overlapping. So the area removed is less than 25\u03c0. But calculating that would require knowing the overlapping area, which is more complex.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the area of the remaining paper after cutting, but the semicircles are drawn on the same side, and their overlapping region is subtracted only once. But without more information, it's hard to compute.\n\nHmm. I think I'll have to proceed with the initial answer, even though it doesn't match the options. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about a different shape, like a circle, but the question says square.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is about the area of the paper after cutting, but the semicircles are drawn on the same side, each with diameter 20 cm, but the area is subtracted only once. So area removed is 50\u03c0. Remaining area:400 -50\u03c0\u2248400-157.08\u2248242.92. Still not matching.\n\nI'm really stuck. I think I'll have to go with the initial calculation and see if any of the options match. But none do, so perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, or I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the area of the remaining part after cutting, but the semicircles are only on one side. So the area removed is 50\u03c0. Remaining area:400 -50\u03c0\u2248242.92. Still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about the area of the paper after cutting, but the semicircles are only on one side, but the problem says opposite sides.\n\nHmm. I think I've tried everything. I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is approximately 85.84 cm\u00b2, but since that's not an option, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the side is 2 cm, making the area\u22480.86 cm\u00b2, which still doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the area of the region that's not part of the semicircles, but that's the same as the remaining area.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. I'll have to go with the initial calculation, even though it doesn't match the options.\n\n\nThe problem involves a square with a side length of 20 cm. The area of the square is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of the square} = 20 \\times 20 = 400 \\, \\text{cm}^2\n\\]\n\nTwo semicircles are drawn on opposite sides of the square, with each side serving as the diameter of a semicircle. Since the diameter of each semicircle is 20 cm, the radius of each semicircle is:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\, \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\nThe area of one semicircle is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of one semicircle} = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi r^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi (10)^2 = 50\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^2\n\\]\n\nSince there are two semicircles, the total area of the semicircles is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total area of two semicircles} = 2 \\times 50\\pi = 100\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^2\n\\]\n\nThe area of the remaining paper after cutting down the semicircles is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining area} = \\text{Area of the square} - \\text{Total area of the semicircles}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining area} = 400 - 100\\pi\n\\]\n\nUsing the approximation \\(\\pi \\approx 3.1416\\), the remaining area is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining area} \\approx 400 - 100 \\times 3.1416 = 400 - 314.16 = 85.84 \\, \\text{cm}^2\n\\]\n\nHowever, the provided options (A) 8.75, (B) 8.79, (C) 8.75, (D) 8.71, (E) 8.72) are significantly smaller than this calculated value. This discrepancy suggests either a misinterpretation of the problem or an issue with the options. Despite multiple attempts to reinterpret the problem, none of the interpretations align with the given options. Therefore, the calculated value of approximately \\(85.84 \\, \\text{cm}^2\\) does not match any of the provided options.\n\nGiven the mismatch between the calculated result and the options, it is unclear how to reconcile the answer. However, based on the initial interpretation, the closest numerical value to the calculated result is not among the options.\n\nANSWER: None of the options match the calculated value.",
