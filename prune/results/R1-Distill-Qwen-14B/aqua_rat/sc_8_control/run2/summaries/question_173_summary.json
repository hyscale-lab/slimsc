      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Allen and Bob moving towards each other and then changing directions upon reaching the ends. The question is asking for the distance between X and Y. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me parse the problem. Allen starts from X, Bob from Y, moving towards each other. Allen's speed is 54 km/h, Bob's is 78 km/h. They meet for the second time, and by then, Bob has covered 48 km more than Allen. We need to find the distance between X and Y.\n\nHmm, so maybe I should visualize their movements. Let's think about their first meeting. Then, after that, they continue to their respective ends, turn around, and then move again, possibly meeting a second time.\n\nWait, but the problem says when they meet for the second time, Bob has covered 48 km more than Allen. So perhaps I should model their positions over time until that second meeting.\n\nLet me denote the distance between X and Y as D km.\n\nIn the first scenario: Allen goes from X to Y, Bob from Y to X. They meet somewhere in between. After that, Allen reaches Y, turns back, and Bob reaches X, turns back. Then, they start moving towards each other again, and meet for the second time.\n\nWait, but does that necessarily mean that they meet on their way back? Or maybe not? I need to think about the timing.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Both start moving towards each other. Let's find when they meet the first time.\n\n2. After that, Allen continues to Y, Bob to X. Find the time taken for each to reach their respective ends.\n\n3. Then, they turn around and start moving back towards their original starting points. Now, they might meet again somewhere in between.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that they meet for the second time, so perhaps there's a second meeting, but the first meeting is when they are moving towards each other, and the second when they're moving in opposite directions again after turning around.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second meeting happens before they reach the ends? Hmm, no, because the problem says \"once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction,\" implying that he has to reach Y before turning back. Same for Bob.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- They start moving towards each other.\n- Meet for the first time somewhere in the middle.\n- Continue moving to their destinations.\n- Allen turns around at Y, Bob turns around at X.\n- Then they start moving back towards their original points, and meet again somewhere.\n\nSo, the second meeting occurs after they've both turned around once.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should model the total distance each has traveled until the second meeting.\n\nWait, the problem says that when they meet for the second time, Bob has covered 48 km more than Allen. So, the total distance Bob traveled minus Allen's total distance equals 48 km.\n\nLet me denote the time until the second meeting as t hours.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to think in terms of the first meeting and then the time taken after that until the second meeting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the sum of their distances until the second meeting.\n\nWait, let's think about the first meeting.\n\nAt the first meeting, let's say they meet after time t1. In that time, Allen has traveled 54*t1, Bob has traveled 78*t1. Since they're moving towards each other, the sum of their distances equals D.\n\nSo, 54 t1 + 78 t1 = D \u2192 132 t1 = D \u2192 t1 = D / 132.\n\nAt this point, Allen is at some point between X and Y, and Bob is at some point between Y and X.\n\nThen, after the first meeting, Allen continues to Y. The distance he has left is D - 54 t1. Time taken to reach Y after the first meeting is (D - 54 t1)/54.\n\nSimilarly, Bob continues to X. The distance he has left is D - 78 t1. Time taken to reach X after the first meeting is (D - 78 t1)/78.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to compute the time each takes to reach their destination after the first meeting.\n\nWait, Allen has already covered 54 t1, so the remaining distance to Y is D - 54 t1. Time taken is (D -54 t1)/54.\n\nSimilarly for Bob: time to reach X is (D -78 t1)/78.\n\nBut since Allen and Bob are moving towards each other initially, after the first meeting, they continue towards their respective ends. So, the time taken for each to reach their destination would vary.\n\nWait, perhaps the time Allen takes to reach Y after the first meeting is (D -54 t1)/54 = (D -54*(D/132)) /54.\n\nSimilarly for Bob.\n\nWait, let me compute that.\n\nD -54 t1 = D -54*(D/132) = D (1 - 54/132) = D (78/132) = D (13/22).\n\nSo, time for Allen to reach Y after first meeting is (13D/22) /54 = (13 D) / (22 * 54) = 13 D / 1188.\n\nSimilarly, for Bob, the remaining distance is D -78 t1 = D -78*(D/132) = D (1 - 78/132) = D (54/132) = D (9/22).\n\nTime taken for Bob to reach X after first meeting is (9D/22)/78 = 9D/(22 *78) = 9 D / 1716.\n\nWait, but these times might not be the same. So, the person who takes less time will reach their destination first and start moving back, while the other is still on their way.\n\nSo, which one is faster? Let's see: Allen's time after first meeting is 13D/1188, Bob's is 9D/1716.\n\nLet me compute 13D/1188 and 9D/1716.\n\nWait, 1188 = 132 * 9 = 132*9. Wait, 132 *9 is 1188. 1716 is 132 *13.\n\nSo, 13D/(1188) = 13D/(132 *9) = (13 D)/(132*9) = (13 D)/(1188).\n\n9D/(1716) =9D/(132 *13) = (9 D)/(1716).\n\nComparing the two, which is bigger? Let's see:\n\n13 D/(1188) vs 9 D/(1716).\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by D (since D>0).\n\nCompute 13/1188 \u2248 0.01102.\n\n9/1716 \u2248 0.00525.\n\nSo, 13/1188 is bigger. So, Allen takes longer to reach Y than Bob takes to reach X. So, Bob arrives at X first, turns around, and starts moving back towards Y, while Allen is still on his way to Y.\n\nSo, the time between the first meeting and Allen reaching Y is longer than the time between first meeting and Bob reaching X.\n\nTherefore, Bob will have a head start on his return journey.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the times.\n\nLet me compute t1 = D/132.\n\nAfter t1, Allen takes t2 = (13D/22)/54 = (13 D)/(22*54) = 13D/(1188) hours to reach Y.\n\nBob takes t3 = (9D/22)/78 = (9 D)/(22*78) = 9 D/(1716) hours to reach X.\n\nSo, the time between the first meeting and Allen reaching Y is t2, and for Bob it's t3.\n\nSo, the difference between t2 and t3 is t2 - t3.\n\nWhich is 13 D/(1188) - 9 D/(1716).\n\nLet me compute this.\n\n13 D * 1716 - 9 D * 1188 all over (1188 * 1716).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to find a common denominator.\n\n1188 = 132 *9, 1716 = 132 *13.\n\nSo, the denominator is 132^2 * 9 *13.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute the actual value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute t2 and t3:\n\nt2 = 13D/(1188) = (13D)/(1188) \u2248 0.01102 D.\n\nt3 = 9D/(1716) \u2248 0.00525 D.\n\nSo, t2 is longer than t3 by about 0.00577 D.\n\nWait, but let me compute exactly:\n\nt2 = (13 D)/(1188) = (13 D) / (1188) = (13/1188) D.\n\nt3 = (9 D)/(1716) = (9/1716) D.\n\nSo, t2 - t3 = [ (13 * 1716) - (9 * 1188) ) ] D / (1188 *1716 )\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n13*1716 = 22308.\n\n9*1188 = 10692.\n\nSo, numerator = 22308 -10692 = 11616.\n\nDenominator = 1188 * 1716.\n\nSo, t2 - t3 = 11616 D / (1188 * 1716).\n\nHmm, let me compute 1188 *1716.\n\nWait, 1188 = 132 *9, 1716=132*13.\n\nSo, 132^2 *9 *13 = 132^2 * 117.\n\nBut maybe I can compute it as:\n\n1188 * 1716 = (1200 -12) * (1700 +16) \u2192 Not sure, maybe it's easier to compute 1188 *1716.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can factor 11616.\n\n11616 divided by 132: 11616 /132 = 88.\n\nWait, 132 *88= 11616. Oh right.\n\nSo, t2 - t3 = (132 *88 D ) / (1188 * 1716 )\n\nBut 1188 = 132 *9, 1716=132 *13.\n\nSo,\n\nt2 - t3 = (132 *88 D) / (132 *9 *132 *13 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (88 D) / (9 *132 *13 )\n\nHmm, 88 is 8 *11, 132 is 12 *11.\n\nSo,\n\n= (8 *11 D) / (9 *12 *11 *13 )\n\nThe 11 cancels:\n\n= (8 D) / (9 *12 *13 )\n\n= 8 D / (1404 )\n\n= 2 D / (351 )\n\nSo, t2 - t3 = (2 D)/351.\n\nWait, this is the time between when Bob reaches X and Allen reaches Y.\n\nWait, no. Because Bob reaches X after t3, and Allen reaches Y after t2. So, the time between Bob reaching X and Allen reaching Y is t2 - t3.\n\nSo, during this time, Bob is moving towards Y at 78 km/h, while Allen is still moving towards Y.\n\nWait, no, Allen hasn't turned around yet. So, during this time, Bob is moving towards Y at 78 km/h, and Allen is moving towards Y at 54 km/h.\n\nWait, but Allen is still approaching Y. So, the distance between Bob (at X) and Allen is decreasing as Bob moves towards Y and Allen approaches Y.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the positions.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think about the total time until the second meeting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the entire journey.\n\nWait, perhaps let's compute the total time until the second meeting.\n\nLet me think: After the first meeting, the time until Allen reaches Y is t2, and the time until Bob reaches X is t3.\n\nSo, Bob reaches X first, then starts moving back towards Y at 78 km/h.\n\nAllen is still on his way to Y, which he reaches after t2.\n\nSo, the time between Bob starting back and Allen starting back is (t2 - t3).\n\nWait, no. The time between Bob reaching X and Allen reaching Y is (t2 - t3) as computed earlier.\n\nSo, during that time, Bob is moving towards Y, and Allen is moving towards Y as well.\n\nSo, during this (t2 - t3) time, Bob has moved 78 * (t2 - t3) km towards Y.\n\nAllen has moved 54 * (t2 - t3) km towards Y.\n\nWait, but when Allen reaches Y, he turns around, so after that, both are moving towards each other again.\n\nWait, perhaps the second meeting occurs after both have turned around.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second meeting occurs while Allen is still moving towards Y and Bob is moving back towards Y.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should think in terms of the total distance each has traveled by the second meeting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total distance Allen has traveled is D (from X to Y) plus some distance back towards X.\n\nSimilarly, Bob has traveled D (from Y to X) plus some distance back towards Y.\n\nWait, but perhaps the second meeting occurs after both have turned around. Let's see.\n\nWait, let me denote the time until the second meeting as t_total.\n\nSo, t_total is the time from when they started until the second meeting.\n\nWait, but perhaps that's not the easiest approach. Alternatively, perhaps consider the time from the first meeting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps model the entire scenario.\n\nLet me try this approach:\n\nTotal time until second meeting: t.\n\nIn this time, Allen has gone from X to Y (distance D) and then back a certain distance, let's say he meets Bob after moving back S km from Y.\n\nSimilarly, Bob has gone from Y to X (distance D) and then back a certain distance, say T km from X.\n\nWait, but the total distance Allen has traveled is D + S.\n\nBob's total distance is D + T.\n\nBut when they meet the second time, the sum of the distances they've traveled since their respective turns should equal 2D - (distance covered before turning).\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps after the first meeting, Allen goes to Y, which is D - (54 t1) km away, taking t2 time. Then he turns around and goes back towards X for some time t_meet, during which he covers some distance S.\n\nSimilarly, Bob goes to X, which is D - (78 t1) km away, taking t3 time. Then he turns around and goes back towards Y for some time t_meet, during which he covers distance T.\n\nWait, but I'm complicating it. Maybe I should model the time from the first meeting.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the entire time.\n\nLet me think of the first meeting as happening at time t1, where t1 = D/(54 +78) = D/132.\n\nAt that point, Allen has traveled 54 t1 = 54*(D/132) = (54/132) D = (9/22) D.\n\nBob has traveled 78 t1 = (78/132) D = (13/22) D.\n\nThen, after the first meeting, Allen continues to Y, which is (D - 9D/22) = (13D/22) away. The time taken for Allen to reach Y is (13D/22)/54 = (13 D)/(22*54) = 13 D/(1188).\n\nSimilarly, Bob has to go from his position to X, which is (D -13D/22) = 9D/22 away. Time taken for Bob to reach X is (9D/22)/78 = 9 D/(22*78) = 9 D/(1716).\n\nAs before, 13 D/(1188) is bigger than 9 D/(1716), so Bob arrives at X first.\n\nOnce Bob reaches X, he turns around and starts moving back towards Y at 78 km/h.\n\nNow, the time between Bob reaching X and Allen reaching Y is t2 - t3 = (13 D/1188) - (9 D/1716) = (2 D)/351, as calculated earlier.\n\nDuring this time, Bob is moving towards Y at 78 km/h, so he covers 78 * (2 D/351) = (156 D)/351 = (52 D)/117 = (4 D)/9 km.\n\nSo, when Allen reaches Y, Bob is at a point (4 D)/9 km away from X towards Y.\n\nWait, no: when Bob reached X, he started moving towards Y. The time between Bob reaching X and Allen reaching Y is (t2 - t3), so during that time, Bob moves towards Y, covering 78*(t2 - t3) = 78*(2D/351) = (156 D)/351 = (52 D)/117 = 4 D /9 km.\n\nSo, when Allen starts moving back from Y towards X, Bob is at position (4 D/9) km from X.\n\nSo, the distance between them when Allen starts moving back is D - (4 D/9) = (5 D)/9 km.\n\nNow, both are moving towards each other: Allen at 54 km/h, Bob at 78 km/h. So, their relative speed is 54 +78=132 km/h.\n\nThe time until they meet again is the distance between them divided by their relative speed: (5 D/9) / 132 = (5 D)/(9 *132) = 5 D/(1188) hours.\n\nIn this time, Allen will have moved towards X: 54 * (5 D/1188) = (270 D)/1188 = (45 D)/198 = (15 D)/66 = (5 D)/22 km.\n\nSimilarly, Bob will have moved towards Y: 78 * (5 D/1188) = (390 D)/1188 = (65 D)/198 = (5 D)/16. Wait, wait, let's compute 390/1188:\n\n390 divided by 1188: both divide by 6 \u2192 65/198. So, 65 D/198.\n\nWait, 65 and 198: do they have any common factors? 65 is 5*13, 198 is 2*9*11. No, so it's 65 D/198.\n\nSo, when they meet the second time, Allen has moved back 5 D/22 km from Y, and Bob has moved back 65 D/198 km from X.\n\nWait, but perhaps the total distance each has traveled by the second meeting can be calculated.\n\nLet me think: Allen's total distance is the distance from X to Y (D) plus the distance back towards X (5 D/22). So, total is D + 5 D/22 = (22 D +5 D)/22 =27 D/22.\n\nBob's total distance is the distance from Y to X (D) plus the distance back towards Y (65 D/198). So, total is D + 65 D/198 = (198 D +65 D)/198 =263 D/198.\n\nAccording to the problem, when they meet for the second time, Bob has covered 48 km more than Allen. So, Bob's total distance minus Allen's total distance is 48 km.\n\nSo,\n\n263 D/198 - 27 D/22 = 48.\n\nLet me compute this.\n\nFirst, find a common denominator. 198 is 9*22. So, 27 D/22 is equal to (27*9 D)/(22*9) )=243 D/(198).\n\nSo,\n\n263 D/198 -243 D/198 = (263 -243) D /198 =20 D/198 =48.\n\nSimplify 20 D /198 =48.\n\nSo,\n\n20 D =48 *198.\n\nCompute 48 *198:\n\n48 *200=9600 \u2192 48*(200-2) =9600-96=9504.\n\nSo,\n\n20 D=9504 \u2192 D=9504/20=475.2 km.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the options are all below 144 km. So, I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the distances each has traveled.\n\nLet me retrace.\n\nWait, when they meet the second time, the total time is t1 + t2 + t_meet.\n\nWait, t1 is the time until first meeting: D/132.\n\nt2 is the time Allen takes after first meeting to reach Y: 13D/(1188).\n\nt3 is the time Bob takes after first meeting to reach X:9D/(1716).\n\nThen, after that, Bob starts moving back, and Allen is still moving towards Y. The time between Bob starting back and Allen starting back is (t2 - t3) = (13D/1188 -9D/1716)= (2D/351) as before.\n\nDuring that time, Bob moves towards Y, covering 78*(2D/351)= (156 D)/351= (52 D)/117= (4 D)/9.\n\nSo, when Allen starts moving back from Y, Bob is (4D/9) km from X, so the distance between them is D -4D/9=5D/9.\n\nThey are moving towards each other, so the time until they meet again is (5D/9)/(54+78)= (5D/9)/132=5D/(9*132)=5D/1188.\n\nSo, the time from when Allen starts moving back is 5D/1188.\n\nSo, during this time, Allen moves 54*(5D/1188)= (270 D)/1188= 45 D/198=15 D/66=5 D/22 km towards X.\n\nSimilarly, Bob moves 78*(5D/1188)= (390 D)/1188=65 D/198 km towards Y.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nSo, Allen's total distance is D (to Y) +5D/22 (back towards X) = D +5D/22= (27 D)/22.\n\nBob's total distance is D (to X) +65D/198 (back towards Y) = D +65D/198= (263 D)/198.\n\nSo, Bob's distance minus Allen's distance is (263 D/198) - (27 D/22) =48 km.\n\nWait, let's compute this correctly.\n\n27 D/22 = (27 *9 D)/(22*9)= 243 D/198.\n\nSo,\n\n263 D/198 -243 D/198 =20 D/198=48.\n\nSo,\n\n20 D =48 *198=9504.\n\nD=9504/20=475.2 km.\n\nBut this is not one of the options. The options are 144,72,126,84,48.\n\nHmm, so I must have made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the second meeting occurs before Allen reaches Y. So, perhaps I was wrong in assuming that both have to reach their ends and turn around before the second meeting.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the second meeting occurs while Allen is still going towards Y and Bob is returning from X.\n\nWait, perhaps after the first meeting, they continue moving towards their respective ends. But before Allen reaches Y and Bob reaches X, they might meet again.\n\nWait, but the problem states that they change direction only after reaching the ends. So, the second meeting can't happen before they turn around.\n\nWait, no, because the problem says \"Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y.\"\n\nSo, until they reach their respective ends, they keep moving in the same direction.\n\nSo, the first meeting is when they are moving towards each other.\n\nThe second meeting must happen after both have turned around, i.e., after Allen has reached Y and turned back, and Bob has reached X and turned back.\n\nWait, but in that case, the time until the second meeting is after both have turned around.\n\nBut according to the earlier calculation, that gives D=475.2 km, which isn't an option.\n\nSo, perhaps I made a mistake in the model.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the entire journey as a single relative motion.\n\nWait, another approach: The combined speed is 54+78=132 km/h.\n\nThey meet for the first time after time t1= D/132, as before.\n\nThen, to meet again, they have to cover 2D distance between them again (since they turn around upon reaching ends). So, the time between first and second meeting is 2D/132= D/66.\n\nSo, the total time until the second meeting is t1 + t_meet= D/132 + 2D/132= 3D/(132) = D/44.\n\nWait, but wait, that's only true if they meet again while moving towards each other after both have turned around.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the time between meetings is D/(54 +78) = D/132 for the first, and then 2D/132 for the second.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me think.\n\nAfter the first meeting, each reaches their end, turns around, and then the combined speed is again 132 km/h. The distance between them is zero at the first meeting, but after turning around, they are moving towards each other again, but the distance they need to cover is 2D.\n\nWait, perhaps the time between the first and second meeting is (2D)/132= D/66.\n\nSo, the total time until the second meeting is t1 + t_meet= D/132 + D/66= D/132 +2D/132=3D/132= D/44.\n\nSo, the total time is D/44.\n\nIn that time, Allen's total distance is 54*(D/44)=54 D/44=27 D/22.\n\nSimilarly, Bob's total distance is 78*(D/44)=78 D/44=39 D/22.\n\nThe difference is (39 D/22) - (27 D/22) =12 D/22 =6 D/11.\n\nAccording to the problem, this difference is 48 km.\n\nSo,\n\n6 D/11=48 \u2192 D=48*(11/6)=8*11=88 km.\n\nWait, 88 is not one of the options. The options are A)144, B)72, C)126, D)84, E)48.\n\nHmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the time between the first and second meeting is not 2D/132. Because after the first meeting, they reach their ends, turn around, and then start moving towards each other again. The distance between them after turning around is 2D.\n\nWait, no. Because when they meet for the first time, they're somewhere in between. Then, after reaching their respective ends, they turn around, and the distance between them is again D. Because they're at opposite ends.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think.\n\nAfter the first meeting, Allen goes to Y, which is (D -54 t1) away, and Bob goes to X, which is (D -78 t1) away. After they reach their ends and turn around, they are now at Y and X, respectively, and start moving towards each other again. So, the distance between them is D again.\n\nWait, so the time until they meet again is D/(54 +78)=D/132.\n\nSo, the time between the first meeting and the second meeting is D/132.\n\nSo, the total time until the second meeting is t1 + t_meet= D/132 + D/132= 2D/132= D/66.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the time between the first meeting and the second was D/66, but now I'm getting the same result.\n\nWait, but according to this, the total time until the second meeting is D/66.\n\nSo, Allen's total distance is 54*(D/66)=54 D/66=9 D/11.\n\nBob's total distance is78*(D/66)=78 D/66=13 D/11.\n\nThe difference is (13 D/11 -9 D/11)=4 D/11=48 km.\n\nSo,\n\n4 D/11=48 \u2192 D=48*(11/4)=12*11=132 km.\n\nWait, 132 is an option (option A). But earlier I thought the answer was 88 km. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from whether the time between the first and second meeting is D/132 or 2D/132.\n\nWait, let me think again. After the first meeting, each goes to their respective ends, turns around, and then they're moving towards each other again. So, the distance between them is D. So, the time until they meet again is D/(54+78)=D/132. So, the time between first and second meeting is D/132.\n\nSo, the total time is t1 + t_meet= D/132 + D/132=2D/132= D/66.\n\nSo, the total time is D/66.\n\nIn this time, Allen travels 54 * (D/66) = (54/66) D= (9/11) D.\n\nBob travels78 * (D/66)= (78/66) D= (13/11) D.\n\nDifference is (13/11 D -9/11 D)=4 D/11=48 km.\n\nSo, 4D/11=48 \u2192 D=48*(11/4)=132 km.\n\nSo, the distance is 132 km, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that when I computed the time after the first meeting, I arrived at D=475.2 km, which isn't an option. So, perhaps the correct approach is the second one, leading to D=132 km.\n\nBut why the discrepancy?\n\nAh, perhaps in the first approach, I assumed that the second meeting occurs after both have turned around, but perhaps that model is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the time between the first and second meetings as D/132, leading to D=132 km.\n\nBut 132 is option A. But let me check the options again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)144 km\n\nB)72 km\n\nC)126 km\n\nD)84 km\n\nE)48 km\n\nHmm, 132 is not an option. Wait, wait, the options have A)144. So, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, wait, in the first approach, I got D=475.2, which is not an option. In the second approach, D=132, which is not an option either.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the second meeting occurs before both have turned around. But according to the problem statement, they change direction only upon reaching the ends.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the second approach by assuming that the time between meetings is D/132. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the first meeting is at time t1= D/(54+78)=D/132.\n\nAfter that, Allen continues to Y, which takes (D-54 t1)/54 = (D -54*(D/132))/54= (D*(132-54)/132)/54= (78 D/132)/54= (78 D)/(132*54)= (13 D)/(1188).\n\nSimilarly, Bob continues to X, which takes (D-78 t1)/78= (D -78*(D/132))/78= (54 D/132)/78= (54 D)/(132*78)=9 D/(1716).\n\nSo, as before, Allen takes longer to reach Y than Bob to reach X.\n\nSo, Bob reaches X first, turns around, and starts moving back towards Y at 78 km/h.\n\nNow, the time between Bob reaching X and Allen reaching Y is t2 - t3= (13 D/1188) - (9 D/1716)= (2 D)/351.\n\nDuring this time, Bob moves towards Y:78*(2 D/351)= (156 D)/351= (52 D)/117= (4 D)/9 km.\n\nSo, when Allen starts moving back from Y towards X, Bob is (4 D)/9 km away from X towards Y.\n\nSo, the distance between them is D - (4 D/9)=5 D/9 km.\n\nThey are moving towards each other with combined speed 54+78=132 km/h.\n\nTime until they meet: (5 D/9)/132=5 D/(9*132)=5 D/1188.\n\nSo, the time from when Allen starts moving back is 5 D/1188.\n\nIn this time, Allen moves 54*(5 D/1188)= (270 D)/1188= (45 D)/198= (15 D)/66=5 D/22 km towards X.\n\nBob moves 78*(5 D/1188)= (390 D)/1188= (65 D)/198 km towards Y.\n\nSo, the total distance each has traveled:\n\nAllen: D (to Y) +5 D/22 (back towards X)= (27 D)/22.\n\nBob: D (to X) +65 D/198 (back towards Y)= (263 D)/198.\n\nDifference: (263 D/198) - (27 D/22)= (263 D/198) - (243 D/198)=20 D/198=48.\n\nSo, 20 D=48 *198=9504 \u2192 D=9504/20=475.2 km.\n\nBut this is not an option, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of Bob's movement. After turning around, Bob is moving towards Y, and Allen is moving towards X. So, when they meet, their combined distance after turning around should sum up to D.\n\nWait, no, the distance between them when they start moving towards each other after turning around is (4 D/9) from X, so the distance between them is D -4 D/9=5 D/9.\n\nBut according to this, the calculation is correct.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is in the model. Maybe the second meeting doesn't happen after both have turned around, but earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the second meeting occurs while Bob is moving back towards Y, and Allen is still moving towards Y.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, they change direction only upon reaching the end. So, until they reach the ends, they continue in their original direction.\n\nSo, perhaps the second meeting occurs before Allen reaches Y.\n\nWait, but how? Because after the first meeting, Allen is moving towards Y, Bob towards X. So, they can't meet again until after both have turned around.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the second meeting occurs before Allen reaches Y. Let me think.\n\nLet me consider that after the first meeting, Allen continues to Y, and Bob continues to X. Let me denote the time taken until the second meeting as t after the first meeting.\n\nIn this time, Allen travels 54 t km towards Y, and Bob travels 78 t km towards X.\n\nBut since they're moving towards their respective ends, the distance between them after time t is:\n\nAt first meeting, they were at a point where Allen had traveled 54 t1, Bob 78 t1.\n\nAfter that, Allen travels 54 t, Bob 78 t.\n\nThe positions:\n\nAllen is at 54 t1 +54 t from X.\n\nBob is at Y -78 t1 -78 t from X.\n\nWait, no, wait. At first meeting, Allen is at 54 t1 from X, Bob is at D -78 t1 from X.\n\nAfter time t, Allen moves another 54 t towards Y, so his position is 54 t1 +54 t.\n\nBob moves another 78 t towards X, so his position is D -78 t1 -78 t.\n\nThey meet when their positions are the same.\n\nSo,\n\n54 t1 +54 t = D -78 t1 -78 t.\n\nBut t1 is D/132, as before.\n\nSo,\n\n54*(D/132) +54 t = D -78*(D/132) -78 t.\n\nSimplify.\n\nCompute 54 D/132 = (27 D)/66 =9 D/22.\n\nSimilarly, 78 D/132= (39 D)/66=13 D/22.\n\nSo,\n\n9 D/22 +54 t = D -13 D/22 -78 t.\n\nBring like terms together:\n\n54 t +78 t = D -13 D/22 -9 D/22.\n\n132 t = D (1 - (13+9)/22 )= D (1 -22/22 )= D (0 )=0.\n\nWait, that can't be right. So, 132 t=0 \u2192 t=0.\n\nWhich implies that the only solution is t=0, which is the first meeting. So, this suggests that they can't meet again before reaching their ends.\n\nSo, the second meeting must happen after both have turned around.\n\nSo, the only way is that they meet after both have turned around.\n\nBut according to this, the distance D is 475.2 km, which isn't an option. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the model.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I'm including the time after both have turned around in the same way as the first approach, but perhaps the correct way is to model the total distance.\n\nWait, let's think about the total distance each has traveled until the second meeting.\n\nAfter the first meeting, Allen goes to Y, then turns back, and Bob goes to X, then turns back.\n\nAt the time of the second meeting, Allen has traveled D (to Y) plus some distance back towards X.\n\nSimilarly, Bob has traveled D (to X) plus some distance back towards Y.\n\nThe total distance for Allen is D + a, where a is the distance back towards X.\n\nFor Bob, it's D + b, where b is the distance back towards Y.\n\nAt the time of the second meeting, their positions are the same.\n\nBut after turning around, Allen is moving towards X at 54 km/h, Bob towards Y at 78 km/h.\n\nThe time taken after turning around until meeting is t.\n\nSo,\n\na =54 t,\n\nb=78 t.\n\nAnd the sum of the distances they have traveled after turning around is a +b =54 t +78 t=132 t.\n\nBut when they meet, the distance between them after turning around was D (since they were at opposite ends). So, 132 t = D \u2192 t= D/132.\n\nSo, a=54*(D/132)=54 D/132=9 D/22.\n\nb=78*(D/132)=78 D/132=13 D/22.\n\nSo, the total distance Allen has traveled is D +9 D/22= (22 D +9 D)/22=31 D/22.\n\nBob's total distance is D +13 D/22= (22 D +13 D)/22=35 D/22.\n\nThe difference is 35 D/22 -31 D/22=4 D/22=2 D/11=48 km.\n\nSo,\n\n2 D/11=48 \u2192 D=48*(11/2)=24*11=264 km.\n\nStill, 264 isn't an option.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Let me think differently.\n\nThe problem states that when they meet for the second time, Bob has covered 48 km more than Allen.\n\nSo, let me denote:\n\nAt the second meeting, Bob's total distance = Allen's total distance +48.\n\nWe need to find the time until the second meeting.\n\nLet me denote the time until the second meeting as t.\n\nIn this time, Allen travels 54 t km, Bob 78 t km.\n\nBut wait, this would be the case if they were moving towards each other continuously without turning. But in reality, they turned around after reaching their ends.\n\nHmm, this approach may not work.\n\nAlternative approach: The combined distance covered by both until the second meeting is 3D.\n\nBecause:\n\n- They first meet after covering D together.\n\n- Then, Allen goes to Y (another D), Bob to X (another D), then they meet again after covering another D together.\n\nWait, that makes 3D total.\n\nSo, total combined distance is 3D.\n\nTime taken is 3D/(54+78)=3D/132= D/44.\n\nSo, Allen's distance is54*(D/44)=54 D/44=27 D/22.\n\nBob's distance is78*(D/44)=78 D/44=39 D/22.\n\nDifference:39 D/22 -27 D/22=12 D/22=6 D/11=48.\n\nSo,\n\n6 D/11=48 \u2192 D=48*(11/6)=8*11=88 km.\n\nBut 88 is not an option.\n\nWait, but the options don't include 88. So, perhaps this approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the total combined distance until the second meeting is 2D.\n\nBecause after the first meeting, they each go to the ends (another D each, totaling 2D), then meet again after covering another D together.\n\nSo, total combined distance is D (first meeting) +2D (to ends) +D (meeting again)=4D.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the combined distance until the second meeting is 3D.\n\nBecause first D for the first meeting, then 2D for the movement to the ends and turning around, and then D for the meeting again.\n\nSo, total 3D.\n\nSo, time is 3D/(54+78)=3D/132= D/44.\n\nAllen's distance:54*(D/44)=27 D/22.\n\nBob's distance:78*(D/44)=39 D/22.\n\nDifference:12 D/22=6 D/11=48 \u2192 D=88 km.\n\nAgain, 88 not an option.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. All approaches are leading to D=88 or 132, which aren't options. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's interpretation.\n\nWait, let's read the problem again.\n\n\"Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y.\"\n\nSo, perhaps they meet the second time while moving towards each other after both have turned around.\n\nSo, the combined distance covered between the first meeting and the second is 2D.\n\nBecause after the first meeting, Allen goes to Y (D - S) and Bob goes to X (D - (D - S))=S, where S is the distance from Y to the first meeting point.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the combined distance between first and second meeting is 2D.\n\nSo, the time between first and second meeting is 2D/(54+78)=2D/132= D/66.\n\nSo, the total time until the second meeting is D/132 + D/66= D/132 + 2D/132= 3D/132= D/44.\n\nAs before.\n\nSo, Allen's distance:54*(D/44)=27 D/22.\n\nBob's distance:78*(D/44)=39 D/22.\n\nDifference:12 D/22=6 D/11=48 \u2192 D=88 km.\n\nBut again, 88 isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the second meeting happens while one is still moving towards the end and the other has turned around.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, they change direction only upon reaching the end.\n\nSo, perhaps the second meeting occurs after both have turned around.\n\nBut then, the earlier calculation leads to D=475.2, which is not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the second meeting occurs when Allen is returning and Bob is still moving towards X.\n\nWait, but that would mean Bob hasn't reached X yet.\n\nBut according to the problem, he changes direction only upon reaching X.\n\nSo, perhaps I'm missing something in the initial model.\n\nWait, perhaps the second meeting occurs before Allen reaches Y. But according to the problem, he changes direction only upon reaching Y, so that's impossible.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is 144 km.\n\nLet me try D=144.\n\nCheck what the difference in distances would be.\n\nIf D=144,\n\nFirst meeting:\n\nt1=144/132=1.0909 hours.\n\nAllen has traveled 54 *1.0909\u224859.09 km.\n\nBob has traveled 78 *1.0909\u224885.45 km.\n\nAfter that, Allen has 144 -59.09=84.91 km to Y. Time to reach Y:84.91/54\u22481.572 hours.\n\nBob has 144 -85.45=58.55 km to X. Time to reach X:58.55/78\u22480.75 hours.\n\nSo, Bob arrives at X first, then starts moving back towards Y.\n\nThe time between Bob reaching X and Allen reaching Y is 1.572 -0.75\u22480.822 hours.\n\nDuring this time, Bob moves 78 *0.822\u224864.2 km towards Y.\n\nSo, when Allen starts moving back from Y, Bob is at X +64.2 km=64.2 km from X towards Y.\n\nSo, the distance between them is 144 -64.2=79.8 km.\n\nThey move towards each other with combined speed 132 km/h.\n\nTime until meeting:79.8/132\u22480.6045 hours.\n\nIn this time, Allen moves 54 *0.6045\u224832.63 km towards X.\n\nBob moves 78 *0.6045\u224847.16 km towards Y.\n\nSo, Allen's total distance:59.09 (to Y) +32.63 (back)=91.72 km.\n\nBob's total distance:85.45 (to X) +64.2 (to Y) +47.16 (back)= 85.45+64.2=149.65 +47.16=196.81 km.\n\nDifference:196.81 -91.72\u2248105.09 km. Which is not 48 km. So, D=144 is not correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is that the second meeting occurs after both have turned around.\n\nBut then, according to the calculation, D=475.2 km, which isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the initial model is incorrect, and the second meeting occurs before both have turned around.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, they can't meet before turning around because they only change direction upon reaching the ends.\n\nSo, I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet me denote the time until the second meeting as T.\n\nIn this time, Allen has traveled a distance of 54 T.\n\nSimilarly, Bob has traveled 78 T.\n\nBut during this time, they may have turned around once or more.\n\nWait, perhaps T includes the time until the first meeting and the time until the second meeting.\n\nBut this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps model the problem by considering the total distance each has traveled until the second meeting.\n\nLet me denote the time until the second meeting as T.\n\nIn this time, Allen's total distance is 54 T.\n\nSimilarly, Bob's is78 T.\n\nBut Allen may have turned around once (if he reaches Y and comes back) or not.\n\nSimilarly for Bob.\n\nWait, but perhaps the time T is such that Allen has gone to Y and returned part way, and Bob has gone to X and returned part way.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total distance between the two meetings is 2D.\n\nSo, the combined distance after the first meeting until the second is 2D.\n\nSo, time between meetings is 2D/(54+78)=2D/132=D/66.\n\nSo, total time until second meeting is D/132 + D/66=3D/132= D/44.\n\nAs before.\n\nSo, Allen's distance:54*(D/44)=27 D/22.\n\nBob's distance:78*(D/44)=39 D/22.\n\nDifference:12 D/22=6 D/11=48 \u2192 D=88 km.\n\nBut 88 isn't an option. So, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says that when they meet for the second time, Bob has covered 48 km more than Allen. So, Bob's total distance minus Allen's total distance is 48 km.\n\nBut in the model where D=88, the difference is 48 km.\n\nBut since 88 isn't an option, perhaps I should check the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is 144 km, but when I tried D=144 earlier, the difference was 105 km, which is larger than 48.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try D=72.\n\nD=72.\n\nCompute the difference.\n\nFirst meeting time:72/132=0.55 hours.\n\nAllen's distance:54 *0.55=29.7 km.\n\nBob's:78 *0.55=42.9 km.\n\nAfter that, Allen has 72-29.7=42.3 km to Y. Time:42.3/54\u22480.783 hours.\n\nBob has72-42.9=29.1 km to X. Time:29.1/78\u22480.373 hours.\n\nBob reaches X first, then moves back towards Y.\n\nTime between Bob reaching X and Allen reaching Y:0.783 -0.373=0.41 hours.\n\nIn this time, Bob moves 78 *0.41\u224832.0 km towards Y.\n\nSo, when Allen starts moving back, Bob is 32 km from X towards Y.\n\nDistance between them:72 -32=40 km.\n\nTime until meeting:40/(54+78)=40/132\u22480.303 hours.\n\nIn this time, Allen moves 54 *0.303\u224816.36 km towards X.\n\nBob moves78 *0.303\u224823.63 km towards Y.\n\nTotal distances:\n\nAllen:29.7 +42.3 +16.36=88.36 km.\n\nBob:42.9 +29.1 +32 +23.63=127.63 km.\n\nDifference:127.63 -88.36\u224839.27 km.

Not 48.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 84 km.\n\nWait, when D=84, the difference was around 45.77 km, close to 48. Maybe it's the intended answer.\n\nBut why in the calculation earlier when D=88, the difference is 48.\n\nBut 88 isn't an option, so perhaps the intended answer is 144 km, but the calculation didn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as the combined distance after the first meeting being 2D, leading to D=132 km, which isn't an option.\n\nBut perhaps the problem's correct answer is 144 km, which is option A.\n\nBut none of the calculations I did fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial model.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nLet me assume that the time until the second meeting is T.\n\nIn this time, Allen has gone to Y and returned some distance, and Bob has gone to X and returned some distance.\n\nLet me denote the time Allen takes to reach Y as t_A, and the time Bob takes to reach X as t_B.\n\nt_A = (D -54 t1)/54.\n\nt_B = (D -78 t1)/78.\n\nt1 is D/132.\n\nSo,\n\nt_A= (D -54*(D/132))/54 = (D*(1 - 54/132))/54= D*(78/132)/54= (78 D)/(132*54)=13 D/(1188).\n\nt_B= (D -78*(D/132))/78= D*(54/132)/78=54 D/(132*78)=9 D/(1716).\n\nAs before.\n\nNow, the time when both have reached their ends is max(t_A, t_B) = t_A.\n\nSo, after time t_A, Allen starts moving back.\n\nThe time until the second meeting after Allen starts moving back is t.\n\nSo, the total time is t1 + t_A + t.\n\nIn this time, Bob has been moving towards Y for t_A - t_B (time after he reached X and before Allen reached Y) plus t.\n\nSo, Bob's total time moving towards Y is (t_A - t_B) + t.\n\nSo, distance Bob has moved towards Y:78*(t_A - t_B + t).\n\nAllen's distance moving towards X:54 t.\n\nAt the time of the second meeting, their positions from X are:\n\nAllen's position: Y -54 t= D -54 t.\n\nBob's position: X +78*(t_A - t_B + t)=78*(t_A - t_B + t).\n\nBut since they meet, their positions are the same.\n\nSo,\n\nD -54 t =78*(t_A - t_B + t).\n\nSubstitute t_A and t_B:\n\nt_A =13 D/(1188), t_B=9 D/(1716).\n\nSo,\n\nD -54 t =78*( (13 D/1188 -9 D/1716 ) + t ).\n\nCompute (13 D/1188 -9 D/1716 ).\n\nConvert to common denominator: 1188=132*9, 1716=132*13.\n\nSo,\n\n(13 D *13 -9 D *9 )/(132*9*13 )= (169 D -81 D)/(132 *9*13 )=88 D/(132 *9 *13 )= (88 D)/(132*117)= (88 D)/(15444).\n\nWait, 88 and 15444: 88 is 8*11, 15444 divided by 88: 15444 /88=175.5. Not sure, perhaps factor:\n\nWait, 15444=132*117= (12*11)*117=12*11*117.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's easier to compute 13 D/1188 -9 D/1716 = (13 D *1716 -9 D *1188 )/(1188 *1716 ).\n\nCompute numerator: 13
