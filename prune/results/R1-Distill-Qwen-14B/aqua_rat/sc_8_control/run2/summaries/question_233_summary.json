      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe problem says that Jack can clean a yacht by himself in 12 hours. One day, he finishes two-thirds of the work, and the remaining one-third is done by Jill. But wait, Jill's cleaning rate is only 5% of what Jack can do. The question is, how long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work?\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. First, I think I should figure out how much work each person does and then find out how long it takes Jill to do her part.\n\nI remember that work problems often involve rates. Like, the rate at which someone works. So, maybe I should find Jack's work rate first. If Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours, his rate would be 1 yacht per 12 hours. Or, more precisely, his rate is 1/12 yachts per hour. Because in one hour, he does 1/12 of the job.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the work is in fractions, like two-thirds and one-third. So, maybe I should think of the total work as 1 unit. So, the whole job is 1.\n\nJack's rate is 1/12 per hour. So, how much work does he do when he works for some time? It's his rate multiplied by the time he works. But in this case, he finishes two-thirds of the work. So, the amount of work done by Jack is (1/12) * t = 2/3, where t is the time he spends working. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the problem says he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. So, maybe he works for a certain time, and in that time, he completes two-thirds of the job.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's phrased that he does two-thirds of the work, which would mean he spends a certain amount of time, and during that time, he completes two-thirds. So, I can set up the equation:\n\nJack's rate * time = 2/3.\n\nSo, (1/12) * t = 2/3. Solving for t gives t = (2/3) / (1/12) = (2/3) * 12 = 8 hours. Oh, so Jack works for 8 hours, completing two-thirds of the job. Then, the remaining one-third is done by Jill.\n\nWait, but does the time Jack takes matter for the time Jill takes? Because the question is just about how long Jill takes to finish her portion, regardless of when she does it. So perhaps I can just focus on the remaining work and Jill's rate.\n\nJill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate. So, Jack's rate is 1/12 per hour. 5% of that is 0.05 * (1/12) per hour. Let me calculate that.\n\n0.05 * (1/12) = (5/100) * (1/12) = (1/20) * (1/12) = 1/(240) per hour. Wait, no, wait. Let me compute that again. 5% is 0.05, so 0.05 * (1/12) equals 0.05/12. Let me compute 0.05 divided by 12. Hmm. 0.05 /12 = 0.0041666... per hour. Alternatively, as a fraction, 5% is 1/20, so (1/20) * (1/12) is 1/(240). So, Jill's rate is 1/240 yachts per hour.\n\nWait, but the remaining work is one-third of the job. So, the work left is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. So, how long does Jill take to do 1/3 of the job at a rate of 1/240 per hour?\n\nTime is work divided by rate. So, time = (1/3) / (1/240) = (1/3) * (240/1) = 80 hours. Wait, that's a lot. But looking at the options, the choices are 4,8,22,50,20. Hmm. 80 isn't among them. So, I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait a second, maybe I messed up the rates. Let me re-examine.\n\nJack's rate is 1/12 per hour. So, in one hour, he can do 1/12 of the job. Jill's rate is 5% of that, which is 0.05*(1/12) = 0.05/12 per hour. Let me compute that as a fraction.\n\n0.05 is 5/100, which simplifies to 1/20. So, (1/20) * (1/12) = 1/(240) per hour. So that part is correct. So, the time would be (1/3) divided by (1/240) = 80 hours. But none of the options are 80. Hmm. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the question isn't about the time Jack spends, but about the time he takes to do two-thirds of the job. Wait, the question says he \"happens to finish two-thirds of the work.\" Does that mean that the work he did was two-thirds, regardless of how long it took? So perhaps the time Jack took is not directly needed, except to determine the remaining work.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. The total work is 1 unit. Jack does 2/3, so Jill does 1/3.\n\nJack's rate is 1/12 per hour, so the time he took to do 2/3 is t = (2/3) / (1/12) = 8 hours, as I found earlier. But that might not matter because the question is only about Jill's time.\n\nSo Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's. So, 5% of 1/12 is (0.05)(1/12) = 0.05/12 \u2248 0.0041667 per hour.\n\nThe work left is 1/3. So, time = (1/3) / (0.05/12) = (1/3) * (12/0.05) = (4) / (0.05) = 80 hours. Wait, that's the same as before. But the options don't have 80. So I must be misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the time Jill takes, not in hours, but in some other unit? Or perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the rates.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the work is considered as 12 units, since Jack takes 12 hours. Let's think in terms of work units.\n\nIf the total work is W, then Jack's rate is W/12 per hour.\n\nOn the day in question, Jack does two-thirds of the work. So he does (2/3) W. The time he takes to do this is [(2/3) W] / (W/12) ) = (2/3) * 12 = 8 hours, as before.\n\nSo the remaining work is (1/3) W. Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate. So, Jill's rate is 0.05 * (W/12) per hour. So, how long does she take to do (1/3) W?\n\nTime = (1/3 W) / (0.05 W / 12) ) = (1/3) / (0.05/12) ) = (1/3) * (12 / 0.05) = (4) / 0.05 = 80 hours. Again, same result.\n\nBut the options don't have 80. So perhaps I'm miscalculating something. Wait, the options are A)4, B)8, C)22, D)50, E)20.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that I'm calculating the time as 80 hours, but perhaps I should consider that 5% is a much smaller rate, leading to a longer time. But 80 isn't an option, so I must have a wrong approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of time taken for the remaining work. Wait, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Let me read it again.\n\n\"By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work?\"\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the remaining work. Wait, if Jack does two-thirds, the remaining is one-third, which is correct. So Jill has to do 1/3.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the time Jill takes to do 1/3 of the work. Let me think again about her rate.\n\nJack's rate is 1/12 per hour. So, 1/12 per hour is 1 yacht per 12 hours. So, 5% of that is 0.05 * (1/12) = 1/240 per hour. So, she does 1/240 per hour.\n\nSo, to do 1/3 of the work: time = (1/3) / (1/240) = (1/3) * 240 = 80 hours. Hmm. But the options don't include 80.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I've misread the question. Does Jill's rate being 5% refer to her rate compared to Jack's rate for the same task? Or perhaps I should think about the time Jack took to do two-thirds, but that's 8 hours. Wait, but the time doesn't affect Jill's rate, right? Because her rate is a fixed percentage of Jack's rate.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the time. Let me compute 5% again. 5% is 0.05. So 0.05 * (1/12) is 0.05/12, which is approximately 0.0041666667 per hour.\n\nWait, so (1/3) divided by (0.05/12) is (1/3) * (12/0.05) = (4) * (20) = 80. Hmm, same result.\n\nWait, maybe the question is not about the time for the remaining work but something else. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the question is asking about the time taken for the entire job, but that doesn't make sense because Jack only did two-thirds.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I'm considering the work as 1, but maybe I should think in terms of hours. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I'm supposed to find the time Jill takes, but perhaps she works simultaneously with Jack? No, the problem says he finishes two-thirds and then the remaining is done by Jill. So she works after him.\n\nWait, another thought: Perhaps I should compute the time for Jill to do her part, but considering that she does 5% of Jack's rate, which would make her time longer. But according to my calculations, it's 80 hours, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the rates. Let me think again: 5% of Jack's rate.\n\nJack's rate: 1/12 per hour.\n\n5% of that is 0.05 * (1/12) = 0.05/12 = 1/240 per hour.\n\nSo, for Jill, her rate is 1/240 per hour. So, the time she takes is (1/3) / (1/240) = 80 hours.\n\nBut the options don't have 80. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that Jack can clean in 12 hours, but on this day, he only did two-thirds of the work. So, the time he took to do two-thirds is 8 hours, as earlier. Then, Jill starts working on the remaining one-third.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate, but maybe the 5% is per hour, not in total. Wait, no, the problem says her rate is 5% of Jack's rate.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the question is asking how long it takes Jill to finish her portion, which is one-third, but perhaps I made a miscalculation in the fraction.\n\nWait, let me compute 5% of Jack's rate again. 5% is 0.05, so 0.05 * (1/12) = 0.05/12 = 1/240 per hour. That's correct.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the work is considered in terms of man-hours. So, the total work is 12 hours * 1 (yacht) = 12 man-hours. So, two-thirds of the work is 8 man-hours. So, Jack did 8 man-hours of work, which is two-thirds, so the remaining is 4 man-hours.\n\nBut Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate. Wait, if Jack's rate is 12 man-hours per yacht, then Jill's rate is 0.05 * 12 = 0.6 man-hours per hour. Wait, that can't be right because that would imply she's faster, but that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach isn't correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the work as 12 units. So, total work is 12 units. Jack's rate is 1 unit per hour.\n\nThen, two-thirds of 12 units is 8 units. So, Jack does 8 units in 8 hours.\n\nThe remaining 4 units are done by Jill, whose rate is 5% of Jack's. So, Jill's rate is 0.05 * 1 = 0.05 units per hour.\n\nSo, time taken by Jill is 4 units / 0.05 units per hour = 80 hours. Again, same result.\n\nBut the options don't include 80. So, I'm confused. Maybe the problem has a typo, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I should read the problem again. The question says, \"the remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do.\"\n\nAh! Wait a minute. Maybe I've misread this. Perhaps Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate, meaning that her rate is 0.05 times Jack's rate. So, her rate is 0.05 * (1/12) = 1/240 per hour. So, as before.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way I calculate the time. Let me try again.\n\nJill's rate is 1/240 per hour. So, in t hours, she does t*(1/240) units of work. The remaining work is 1/3, which is 4 units if the total is 12 units.\n\nSo, 4 = t * (1/240) \u2192 t = 4 * 240 = 960 hours. Wait, that's way too high. No, that can't be right. I'm getting more confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the work units. Let me approach it differently.\n\nLet me think of the total work as 1. So, Jack's rate is 1/12 per hour.\n\nJack completes two-thirds of the work, which is (2/3) = 2/3 * 1. So, the time he took is (2/3) / (1/12) = (2/3) *12 = 8 hours. So, he worked 8 hours.\n\nThen, the remaining work is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nJill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate. So, 0.05 * (1/12) = 1/240 per hour.\n\nSo, time for Jill to do 1/3 of the work is (1/3) / (1/240) = (1/3) * 240 = 80 hours.\n\nBut the options don't have 80. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me check the problem again.\n\nWait, the question says \"the remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do.\"\n\nHmm. Oh! Wait a minute. Maybe I misread this. Perhaps Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate, but that would mean her rate is 5% of Jack's rate. Which would make her slower, which aligns with the longer time I calculated.\n\nBut according to the calculations, 80 hours isn't an option. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the time differently. Let me think in terms of how much work Jill can do in one hour.\n\nIf Jack's rate is 1/12 per hour, then Jill's rate is 0.05 * (1/12) = 1/240 per hour. So, in one hour, she does 1/240 of the job.\n\nThe remaining work is 1/3. So, how many hours does she need? Let me compute 1/3 divided by 1/240.\n\n(1/3) \u00f7 (1/240) = (1/3) * (240/1) = 80.\n\nHmm, same result.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using fractions, and maybe I should approach it using time instead. Let me think of the time Jack takes to do two-thirds.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me find how long Jill takes to do the remaining work. Let me think of the work in terms of hours.\n\nIf Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's, then her rate is 0.05 * (1/12) = 1/240 per hour.\n\nSo, the time she takes to do 1/3 of the work is (1/3) / (1/240) = 80 hours.\n\nBut the options are A)4, B)8, C)22, D)50, E)20.\n\nHmm. None of these match 80. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's time, not his rate. No, that wouldn't make sense. The problem says her rate is 5% of Jack's rate.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of how much time Jill takes to do 1/3 of the work at her rate.\n\nWait, another angle: Maybe I should compute the time as (1/3) / (0.05 * (1/12)) = (1/3) / (1/240) = 80. Same result.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the wrong fraction. Let me check the fractions again.\n\nWait, 5% is 0.05, so 0.05 * (1/12) = 1/240 per hour. So, Jill's rate is 1/240 per hour.\n\nSo, to do 1/3 of the job, she needs 80 hours.\n\nBut again, no option matches. So, perhaps the problem is that the remaining work is 1/3, but perhaps I'm supposed to think in terms of the time Jack took, which was 8 hours. Let me think: Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate, so in 8 hours, how much would Jill do?\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the time it takes Jill to do her part in the same time Jack took his part. But that doesn't make sense because she's slower.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options. The options are 4,8,22,50,20. Hmm. 80 isn't there. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that Jack's rate is 1/12 per hour, so in one hour, he does 1/12. So, in two-thirds of the work, how long did he take?\n\nWait, time = work / rate. So, 2/3 divided by 1/12 is 8 hours, correct. Then, the remaining 1/3 is done by Jill at 5% of Jack's rate. So, her rate is 0.05 * (1/12) = 1/240 per hour.\n\nSo, time for Jill is (1/3) / (1/240) = 80. So, I'm confident my calculation is correct, but perhaps the options are incorrect or I'm misreading the problem.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the problem is that the 5% is 5% of the time, not the rate. But the question states it's her rate that's 5% of Jack's. So that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I should compute the time as (1/3) / (0.05 * 1/12) = (1/3) / (1/240) = 80.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the work is being considered as 12 units, and two-thirds is 8 units, so remaining is 4 units. Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate. Jack's rate is 1 unit per hour. So, Jill's rate is 0.05 units per hour. So, time is 4 / 0.05 = 80 hours. Again, same result.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I should check if I'm interpreting the problem correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking how long it takes for both Jack and Jill to finish the remaining work together. But the problem says Jill does the remaining portion after Jack, so she works alone. So, that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a calculation mistake. Let me compute 5% of 1/12.\n\n5% is 0.05. So, 0.05 * (1/12) = 0.05/12 = approximately 0.004166667 per hour.\n\nSo, the time is (1/3) / 0.004166667 \u2248 (0.3333333) / 0.004166667 \u2248 80.\n\nSo, same result.\n\nHmm. I'm not seeing any other way to approach this. Perhaps the problem has a typo, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking at the options, perhaps I should check if I'm miscalculating the time.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the time as (1/3) / (0.05 * (1/12)) = (1/3) * (12/0.05) )= (4) / 0.05 = 80. Correct.\n\nBut none of the options match. So, perhaps the intended answer is 80, but it's not present. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the problem is asking how long it takes Jill to finish the remaining work, but perhaps I should compute it differently. Wait, perhaps the work is 12 hours, so two-thirds is 8 hours, and the remaining is 4 hours. But that would be if they were working together, but that's not the case.\n\nNo, that's not applicable here. Jill's rate is slower, so she would take more time, not less.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I should think in terms of how much time Jill takes to do her part at 5% of Jack's rate, but maybe I'm using the wrong approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of the time as follows:\n\nIf Jack's rate is 1/12 per hour, then in t hours, he does t/12 of the work. The problem says he finishes two-thirds, so t/12 = 2/3 \u2192 t = 8 hours.\n\nSo, the remaining work is 1/3. Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's, which is 0.05 * (1/12) = 1/240 per hour.\n\nSo, time for Jill is (1/3) / (1/240) = 80 hours.\n\nBut again, 80 isn't an option. So, I'm stuck. Maybe the intended answer is 80, but it's not there. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says that Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate for the same portion. Wait, maybe the problem is that I should compute the time based on the rate per the remaining work.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me compute the time using fractions.\n\nJack's rate = 1/12 per hour.\n\nJill's rate = 0.05 * (1/12) = 1/240 per hour.\n\nRemaining work = 1/3.\n\nTime = (1/3) / (1/240) = (1/3) * 240 = 80.\n\nSame result.\n\nI think I must have made a mistake in understanding the problem. Let me read it again carefully.\n\n\"By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work?\"\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate for the entire job, not per hour. But that wouldn't make sense because work rates are generally per unit time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the remaining work is 1/3, and Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate, which is 5% of 1/12 per hour, which is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I'm supposed to find the time in hours, but the options are in different units, like minutes. But the options are labeled as numbers without units, which is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)4\n\nB)8\n\nC)22\n\nD)50\n\nE)20\n\nHmm. 80 isn't present. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that Jack's rate is not 1/12 per hour, but 12 hours per yacht. So, perhaps I should invert that.\n\nWait, no. If Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours, his rate is 1/12 per hour. Because in one hour, he completes 1/12 of the job.\n\nSo, if Jill's rate is 5% of that, it's 0.05 * (1/12) = 1/240 per hour.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident in my calculations. But since 80 isn't an option, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the remaining work is 1/3, but I'm miscalculating it as 1/3 of the total work, but perhaps it's 1/3 of what's left after Jack's work. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the remaining work is 1/3 of the total, which is correct.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll have to go with my calculations, even though it's not matching the options. But perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the total work is 12 hours, and two-thirds is 8 hours, so the remaining is 4 hours. But Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate, so 5% of 12 hours is 0.6 hours. So, time taken by Jill would be 4 / 0.6 = 6.666... hours, which is about 6.67, but that's not an option either.\n\nWait, that approach doesn't make sense because work rates are in terms of per hour, not the total time.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the problem is that I should think in terms of time taken, not rates. For example, if Jack takes 12 hours, then Jill, being 5% as fast, would take 20 times as long. So, for the remaining 1/3, perhaps it's 12 * (20) * (1/3) = 80. Again, same result.\n\nI think I've tried all possible approaches, and I keep getting 80 hours, which isn't an option. So, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or the options provided.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I should compute the time for the remaining work as 1/3 divided by 0.05*(1/12) = 80. But since 80 isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is 80, but it's not listed. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate, meaning that she takes 20 times as long as Jack to do the same job. So, if Jack takes 12 hours, Jill would take 240 hours for the whole job. So, for one-third of the job, she'd take 80 hours. Again, same result.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll have to go with my calculation, even though it's not matching the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the wrong fraction. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me think of the work as 12 units, so each unit represents one hour of Jack's work.\n\nSo, Jack's rate is 12 units per 12 hours = 1 unit per hour.\n\nHe does two-thirds of the work, which is 8 units, so he takes 8 hours. Remaining work is 4 units.\n\nJill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate, so 0.05 * 1 = 0.05 units per hour.\n\nTime for Jill to do 4 units: 4 / 0.05 = 80 hours.\n\nSame result. So, I'm confident that the correct answer is 80 hours, but it's not in the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using 5% instead of 50%. Let me see. If it were 50%, then Jill's rate would be 0.5 * (1/12) = 1/24 per hour. So, time would be (1/3) / (1/24) = 8 hours, which is option B. But the problem says 5%, not 50%. So that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that I should consider the time taken as 80 hours divided by some factor. But I can't think of any reason why.\n\nI think I must have made a mistake, but I can't see where. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the correct option is 80, which isn't present. So, perhaps I should re-examine the problem one more time.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that Jill's rate is 5% per hour, not 5% of Jack's rate. But that would be a different scenario. Let me compute that.\n\nIf Jill's rate is 5% per hour, that would mean she works at a rate that's 5% per hour, which is 0.05 per hour. But that would imply she can finish the job in 20 hours, because 1/0.05 is 20. But she only needs to do 1/3, so time would be (1/3)/0.05 = 6.666..., which is 6 and 2/3 hours, which isn't an option either.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck here. I think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate, so her rate is 0.05 * (12 hours) = 0.6 hours per unit work. So, to do 1/3 of the work, she would take 0.6 * (1/3) = 0.2 hours. But that's 12 minutes, which is not an option either.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Because if her rate is 5% of Jack's rate, and Jack's rate is 1/12 per hour, then Jill's rate is 0.05 * (1/12) = 1/240 per hour. So, time is 80 hours.\n\nI'm really confused. I think I'll have to go with my initial calculation, even though it's not matching the options. But since the options don't include 80, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should choose the closest option, but that's not a good approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me think about the time Jack took to do two-thirds of the work.\n\nJack's rate is 1/12 per hour. So, two-thirds of the work is 2/3, which he does in (2/3)/(1/12) = 8 hours. So, Jill starts after that and does the remaining 1/3.\n\nJill's rate is 0.05 * (1/12) = 1/240 per hour.\n\nTime = (1/3) / (1/240) = 80 hours.\n\nBut again, no option matches. So, perhaps the intended answer is 80, but it's not present. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I should think of the work as 12 units, so each unit is one hour of work. So, the total work is 12 units. Jack's rate is 1 unit per hour. He does two-thirds, which is 8 units, taking 8 hours. Remaining is 4 units.\n\nJill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate, which is 0.05 units per hour. So, time is 4 / 0.05 = 80 hours.\n\nSame result. I think I've tried everything and can't find another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the work is being considered as 100%, and the remaining is 33.333...%, which is 1/3. So, Jill's rate is 0.05 * (1/12) = 1/240 per hour. So, time is 80 hours.\n\nI think I've exhausted all possibilities. I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is 80 hours, but it's not among the options provided. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or the options.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we first determine Jack's work rate. Since Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours, his rate is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Jack's rate} = \\frac{1}{12} \\, \\text{yachts per hour}.\n\\]\n\nOn the particular day, Jack completes two-thirds of the work. The remaining one-third of the work is done by Jill, whose cleaning rate is 5% of Jack's rate. Jill's rate is therefore:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Jill's rate} = 0.05 \\times \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{1}{240} \\, \\text{yachts per hour}.\n\\]\n\nThe remaining work is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining work} = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}.\n\\]\n\nTo find the time it takes Jill to finish the remaining work, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Work}}{\\text{Rate}}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}}{\\frac{1}{240}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 240 = 80 \\, \\text{hours}.\n\\]\n\nThis calculation shows that it would take Jill 80 hours to complete the remaining work. However, none of the provided options (A) 4, (B) 8, (C) 22, (D) 50, (E) 20) match this result. Despite multiple re-evaluations, the conclusion remains consistent: the correct answer is 80 hours, but it is not listed among the options.\n\nGiven the discrepancy, the most reasonable interpretation is that there may be an error in the problem statement or the provided options.\n\n**Answer: None of the options match the correct answer of 80 hours.**",
