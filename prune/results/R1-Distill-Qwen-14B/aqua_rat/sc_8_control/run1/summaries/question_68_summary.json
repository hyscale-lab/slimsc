      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about figuring out how many helpers are needed to prepare for something. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem says each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour. Hmm, so a helper is either making large cakes or small ones, not both at the same time. That makes sense because they can't split their time or something.\n\nThe kitchen is available for 3 hours. So the total time we have is 3 hours. We need to make 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes. The question is, how many helpers do we need?\n\nI think I should calculate how much each helper contributes in 3 hours and then see how many helpers are needed for each type of cake. Then maybe add them up, but wait, maybe they can work on different things at the same time. Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let's break it down. Each helper can make 2 large cakes per hour. So in 3 hours, one helper can make 2 * 3 = 6 large cakes. Alternatively, for small cakes, each helper can make 35 per hour, so in 3 hours, 35 *3 = 105 small cakes.\n\nWe need 20 large cakes. So how many helpers would be needed just for the large cakes?\n\nLet me calculate. Each helper can make 6 large cakes in 3 hours. So number of helpers for large cakes = total needed / per helper. So 20 /6 \u2248 3.333. But we can't have a fraction of a helper, so we'd need to round up to 4 helpers. Because 3 helpers would make 18 cakes, which is not enough. So 4 helpers would make 24, which is more than needed, but better than not enough.\n\nWait, but the total number of helpers is the same for both large and small cakes? Or can they split their time between the two? Oh, wait, no. Each helper can only make either large or small cakes. So the helpers are divided into two groups: those making large and those making small.\n\nSo we need to find how many helpers are needed for each type, then sum them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model it as how much time each helper spends on each task to meet the required number.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the total number of helpers as 'n'. Some of them will make large cakes, others small. Let me denote the number of helpers making large as L, and those making small as S. So L + S = total helpers N.\n\nBut wait, perhaps it's better to find how much time each group needs and set that to 3 hours? Or perhaps think in terms of total cakes produced.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the required man-hours for each type of cake and then add them together, then divide by the available time (3 hours) to find the number of helpers.\n\nMan-hour is a concept where you multiply the number of workers by the time they work. So for large cakes, each helper makes 2 per hour. So per cake, it takes 1/2 helper-hour. Because 2 cakes per hour per helper \u2192 0.5 helper-hours per cake.\n\nSo total man-hours needed for large cakes: 20 cakes * (1/2) helper-hour per cake = 10 helper-hours.\n\nSimilarly, for small cakes, each helper makes 35 per hour. So per small cake, the time is 1/35 helper-hour.\n\nTotal man-hours for small: 700 * (1/35) = 700/35 = 20 helper-hours.\n\nSo total man-hours needed is 10 + 20 = 30 helper-hours.\n\nSince the kitchen is available for 3 hours, the number of helpers needed is total man-hours divided by time. So 30 /3 = 10 helpers.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So 10 helpers are needed. Looking at the options, option B is 10. So the answer would be B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because each helper can't split their time between two tasks. Oh wait, but in this calculation, the man-hours are for each task. So each helper is either working on large or small, so their time is allocated accordingly.\n\nSo 10 helpers would handle both tasks within 3 hours. Let me see:\n\nIf 10 helpers are available, let's say x helpers make large, and (10 -x) make small.\n\nIn 3 hours, the number of large cakes made is 2 * 3 * x =6x.\n\nThe number of small cakes is 35 *3* (10 -x) =105*(10-x).\n\nWe need 6x \u226520 \u2192 x \u226520/6 \u22483.333, so x=4.\n\nAnd 105*(10-x) \u2265700 \u2192105*(6)=630 <700. Oh wait, that's a problem. So with x=4, S=6 helpers making small.\n\nBut 6 helpers making small would make 6*35*3=630, which is less than 700. So that's not enough.\n\nHmm, so this suggests that 10 helpers wouldn't be enough. So perhaps my initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the man-hour approach. Because the helpers can't be split between tasks. So perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's find how many helpers are needed for each task, then add them, but considering that they have to work simultaneously.\n\nSo for the large cakes: each helper makes 6 per 3 hours. To get 20, we need 20 /6 \u22483.333 helpers, which rounds up to 4 helpers.\n\nFor small cakes: each helper makes 105 per 3 hours. We need 700, so 700 /105 =6.666 helpers. So we need 7 helpers.\n\nTotal helpers needed: 4 +7 =11.\n\nBut 11 isn't an option. The options are 8,10,12,15,19. So maybe this approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as a system of equations. Let me denote L as the number of helpers making large cakes, and S as the number making small.\n\nEach helper working on large makes 2 per hour, so in 3 hours, 6 per helper.\n\nEach helper on small makes 35 per hour, so 105 in 3 hours.\n\nSo 6L \u226520,\n\n105S \u2265700.\n\nWe have L and S as integers \u22650.\n\nSo 6L \u226520 \u2192 L \u226520/6 \u22483.333 \u2192 L=4.\n\n105 S \u2265700 \u2192 S \u2265700/105 \u2192700 \u00f7105 is 6.666... \u2192 S=7.\n\nSo L=4, S=7. Total helpers=11.\n\nBut 11 isn't an option. So perhaps the man-hour approach is incorrect, or perhaps the helpers can be assigned to both tasks in a way that doesn't require integer workers, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumption that each helper can only make one type is incorrect. Or perhaps I made a miscalculation in the man-hour approach.\n\nWait, in the man-hour approach, I summed up the man-hours and divided by total time. Maybe that's the right way because it treats the man-power as a single resource that can be split between tasks, but in reality, they can't split. So perhaps the man-hour approach gives the correct answer if we can assign helpers to both tasks simultaneously.\n\nWait, let's think again. Total man-hours needed for large:20/(2/1 hr) \u2192 man-hour per cake * number. Wait, perhaps the man-hour calculation was incorrect.\n\nWait, the man-hour for large cakes: each large cake takes (1 helper)/(2 cakes per hour) )= 0.5 helper hours per cake. So 20 *0.5=10 helper hours.\n\nFor small cakes: each small cake takes (1 helper)/(35 cakes per hour) )= 1/35 helper hours. 700 *1/35 =20 helper hours.\n\nTotal:30 helper-hours. Time available is 3 hours. So 30 /3 =10 helpers.\n\nBut in the previous approach, this would allow 10 helpers to split their time between tasks, but in reality, they can't. So perhaps I need to find a way where helpers can be assigned to both tasks such that both are completed in 3 hours.\n\nWait, but perhaps the man-hour approach assumes that the helpers can be split between tasks in any proportion. So if you have 10 helpers, perhaps some are working on large and others on small, such that both tasks are completed in 3 hours.\n\nBut earlier when I tried that (L=4, S=6), the small cakes weren't enough. So perhaps the man-hour approach is correct, but I made a mistake in the allocation.\n\nWait, let's see. If 10 helpers are available, how should I split them between L and S so that both 20 large and 700 small are made in 3 hours.\n\nLet me set up equations:\n\n6L =20 \u2192 L=20/6 \u22483.333.\n\n105 S =700 \u2192 S=700/105\u22486.666.\n\nBut 3.333 +6.666\u22489.999, which is about 10 helpers. So if 10 helpers are available, and L is about 3.333, S is about 6.666, which adds up to 10.\n\nBut since you can't have a fraction of a helper, perhaps you need to round up. So L=4 and S=7, which requires 11 helpers. But that's more than the 10 helpers calculated through man-hours.\n\nHmm, this is conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the man-hour approach is correct, but the allocation would require that some helpers can split their time, which they can't. So the correct way is to find the minimal number of helpers where the sum of the required helpers for each task is met.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me assume that some helpers can work on large and then switch to small, but that's probably not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the helpers can only work on one type, so we should calculate the helpers needed for each task separately, then sum them.\n\nSo for large cakes, as before: 20 /6 =3.333, so 4 helpers.\n\nFor small cakes:700 /105\u22486.666, so 7 helpers.\n\nTotal helpers:11.\n\nBut 11 isn't an option. The options are 8,10,12,15,19.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe we can use a combination of helpers working on both types, but in a way that allows both tasks to be completed in 3 hours without exceeding the helper count.\n\nLet me let x be the number of helpers assigned to large cakes, and y the number to small. So x + y = N (total helpers).\n\nWe need 6x \u226520 \u2192 x \u226520/6=3.333 \u2192 x=4.\n\nAnd 105 y \u2265700 \u2192 y=700/105\u22486.666 \u2192 y=7.\n\nSo x=4, y=7 \u2192 N=11.\n\nBut again, 11 isn't an option. So perhaps there's a more efficient way to use the helpers.\n\nWait, perhaps the helpers can work on both tasks simultaneously, but the way I thought earlier is correct. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem allows the same helper to make both types, but that doesn't make sense because a helper can't make both types at the same time. So they can choose which type to make.\n\nWait, maybe a different approach: Find the time each helper would take if they split their time between tasks. Wait, but no, each helper can only make one type.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, think in terms of how much time each helper needs to contribute to each task.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of helpers is 10 as per the man-hour approach.\n\nBut wait, when we used 10 helpers, we saw that with 4 and 6 helpers, the small cakes didn't reach 700.\n\nWait, 6 helpers on small cakes make 6 *35 *3=630, which is less than 700.\n\nSo 10 helpers would not be sufficient in that case.\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer is 12 helpers.\n\nWait, let me check. If 10 helpers are used, what is the maximum number of small cakes that can be made.\n\nIf all 10 helpers are on small, they make 10 *35 *3=1050, which is way more than 700. But we also need the large cakes.\n\nAlternatively, let's find a way to satisfy both conditions.\n\nLet me write the equations:\n\n6L + 105S =20 +700 \u2192 Wait, no, that's not correct. Because each helper contributes to either L or S.\n\nWait, no, the total cakes come from L and S helpers.\n\nSo 6L =20 \u2192 L=20/6\u22483.333.\n\n105S=700 \u2192 S=700/105\u22486.666.\n\nSo L + S \u2248 9.999 \u2192 about 10 helpers.\n\nBut since L and S must be integers, we have to round up.\n\nSo if L is 4, S would need to be 7, which totals 11 helpers.\n\nBut 11 isn't an option. The closest option is 10 or 12.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's find the least number of helpers where both tasks can be completed in 3 hours.\n\nLet me denote the number of helpers as N.\n\nLet me let x helpers work on large, and (N-x) on small.\n\nSo, 6x \u226520 \u2192 x \u226520/6 \u22483.333 \u2192 x=4.\n\nAnd 105*(N -x) \u2265700 \u2192 N -x \u2265700/105 \u2192 N -x \u22656.666 \u2192 N -x =7.\n\nSo N = x + (N -x) \u2192 N =4 +7=11.\n\nSo again, 11 helpers.\n\nBut without 11 as an option, perhaps the man-hour approach is correct and the answer is 10, but perhaps we can find a way with 10 helpers where the time is adjusted.\n\nWait, wait, maybe we can have helpers work on both tasks part of the time.\n\nWait, but the problem states each helper can make either 2 large or 35 small per hour. So perhaps they can switch between tasks, but the time spent on each adds up.\n\nWait, perhaps a helper can spend t hours on large and (3-t) hours on small. But that's probably not allowed because each helper can only make one type at a time, but can switch.\n\nBut I think this complicates things. Let's think about it.\n\nLet me consider that each helper can choose to spend some time on large and some on small.\n\nSo for a helper, the total large cakes made would be 2 * t, where t is the time (in hours) they spend on large. Similarly, small cakes made would be 35 * (3 - t).\n\nSo for each helper, they can contribute to both, but the sum of time is 3 hours.\n\nBut perhaps this is complicating it, but maybe it's the correct way.\n\nSo the total large cakes needed is 20= sum over all helpers of 2 * t_i, where t_i is time helper i spends on large.\n\nSimilarly, small cakes:700 = sum over all helpers of 35*(3 - t_i).\n\nLet me denote T as the total time spent on large cakes across all helpers. So T = sum(t_i) for all helpers.\n\nThen, the total large cakes are 2*T \u226520 \u2192 T \u226510.\n\nThe total small cakes: each helper contributes 35*(3 - t_i). So sum(35*(3 - t_i)) =35*(3*N - T) \u2265700.\n\nSo 35*(3N - T) \u2265700 \u2192 3N - T \u226520 \u2192 T \u22643N -20.\n\nWe have T \u226510 and T \u22643N -20.\n\nSo combining, 10 \u2264 T \u22643N -20.\n\nBut T must also be \u22650 and \u22643N.\n\nWe can write:\n\n10 \u2264 3N -20 \u2192 3N \u226530 \u2192 N \u226510.\n\nSo the minimal N is 10.\n\nLet me check N=10.\n\nThen, 3N=30 \u2192 T must be \u226410 (since 3*10 -20=10).\n\nBut T must be \u226510.\n\nSo T must be exactly 10.\n\nSo sum(t_i) =10.\n\nEach helper can spend t_i time on large, and (3 -t_i) on small.\n\nSo the total small cakes would be 35*(3*10 -10) )=35*(30-10)=35*20=700.\n\nWhich meets the requirement.\n\nSo for N=10, it's possible.\n\nHow? Let's see.\n\nEach helper can spend 1 hour on large and 2 hours on small.\n\nBecause 1 hour on large: 2 cakes.\n\n2 hours on small:35 *2=70 cakes per helper.\n\nSo per helper, 2 large and 70 small.\n\nBut wait, with 10 helpers:\n\nTotal large cakes:10 helpers *2 =20. Exactly.\n\nTotal small cakes:10 *70=700. Exactly.\n\nSo yes, with 10 helpers, each working 1 hour on large and 2 on small, we meet both requirements.\n\nSo the minimal number of helpers is 10.\n\nSo the correct answer is B)10.\n\n\nTo determine the number of helpers required, we analyze the problem as follows:\n\nEach helper can either make **2 large cakes** or **35 small cakes** per hour. The kitchen is available for **3 hours**, and we need to produce **20 large cakes** and **700 small cakes**. The goal is to find the minimum number of helpers needed to complete both tasks within the given time.\n\n### Key Calculations:\n1. **Large Cakes**:\n   - Each helper can make **2 large cakes per hour**, so in 3 hours, one helper can make \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\) large cakes.\n   - To produce 20 large cakes, the number of helpers required is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Helpers for large cakes} = \\frac{20}{6} \\approx 3.333\n     \\]\n     Since we cannot have a fraction of a helper, we round up to **4 helpers**.\n\n2. **Small Cakes**:\n   - Each helper can make **35 small cakes per hour**, so in 3 hours, one helper can make \\( 35 \\times 3 = 105 \\) small cakes.\n   - To produce 700 small cakes, the number of helpers required is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Helpers for small cakes} = \\frac{700}{105} \\approx 6.666\n     \\]\n     Again, rounding up, we need **7 helpers**.\n\n3. **Total Helpers**:\n   - Adding the helpers for large and small cakes gives:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total helpers} = 4 + 7 = 11\n     \\]\n     However, **11 helpers** is not one of the provided options. This suggests that the helpers can be optimally allocated to both tasks simultaneously, reducing the total number of helpers required.\n\n### Optimal Allocation:\nTo minimize the number of helpers, we consider that helpers can split their time between tasks. Let \\( t \\) be the time (in hours) a helper spends on large cakes, and \\( 3 - t \\) be the time spent on small cakes. The total contributions from all helpers must meet the required number of cakes.\n\n1. **Large Cakes**:\n   - The total number of large cakes is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times \\text{Total time spent on large cakes} = 20\n     \\]\n     Let \\( T \\) be the total time spent on large cakes across all helpers. Then:\n     \\[\n     2T \\geq 20 \\implies T \\geq 10\n     \\]\n\n2. **Small Cakes**:\n   - The total number of small cakes is:\n     \\[\n     35 \\times \\text{Total time spent on small cakes} = 700\n     \\]\n     The total time spent on small cakes is \\( 3N - T \\), where \\( N \\) is the total number of helpers. Thus:\n     \\[\n     35(3N - T) \\geq 700 \\implies 3N - T \\geq 20\n     \\]\n\n3. **Combining Constraints**:\n   - From the above, we have:\n     \\[\n     10 \\leq T \\leq 3N - 20\n     \\]\n     Substituting \\( T = 10 \\) (the minimum value), we get:\n     \\[\n     10 \\leq 3N - 20 \\implies 3N \\geq 30 \\implies N \\geq 10\n     \\]\n\nThus, the minimum number of helpers required is **10**. With 10 helpers:\n- Each helper spends **1 hour on large cakes** and **2 hours on small cakes**.\n- Total large cakes: \\( 10 \\times 2 = 20 \\).\n- Total small cakes: \\( 10 \\times 35 \\times 2 = 700 \\).\n\nBoth tasks are completed within the 3-hour timeframe.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**B) 10**",
