      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about folding a rectangular sheet and figuring out its area. Hmm, let's see. I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says that when the sheet is folded into two equal halves along one set of sides, each part has a perimeter of 48 cm. And when it's folded along the other set of sides, each part has a perimeter of 66 cm. My goal is to find the area of the original sheet.\n\nWait, so the sheet is a rectangle. Let's denote its length and width as L and W, respectively. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal.\n\nWhen you fold it along one set of sides, I think that means you're folding along the length or the width. Let me visualize this. Folding along one set of sides would halve the sheet either along the length or the width.\n\nLet me think: if you fold along the length, then the new dimensions of each half would be (L/2) and W. Because you're folding along the length, you're cutting it into two parts each of length L/2 and width W.\n\nSimilarly, if you fold along the width, each half would have dimensions L and W/2.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, when you fold along a side, the other dimension becomes half. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, no, maybe I should think in terms of which sides are being folded. So, if the rectangle has length L and width W, and we fold it along the length, then the folded part would have a length of L/2 and the width remains W. Similarly, folding along the width would give a width of W/2 and length remains L.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's the other way around. Wait, maybe I should model this with variables.\n\nLet me denote the original rectangle as having length L and width W.\n\nWhen folded along one set of sides, let's say along the length. So each half will have dimensions L/2 by W. Because the original length is L, and when folded along the length, each half is L/2 in length.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the other set of sides (the width), each half will have dimensions L by W/2.\n\nSo each part, when folded along length, is a rectangle of L/2 and W, and when folded along width, each is L by W/2.\n\nNow, the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + width). So when folded along the length, each half has a perimeter of 2*( (L/2) + W ) = 48 cm.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, each half has a perimeter of 2*( L + (W/2) ) = 66 cm.\n\nSo I can set up two equations based on these perimeters.\n\nEquation 1: 2*( (L/2) + W ) = 48 \u2192 Simplify that.\n\nLet me compute that: 2*(L/2 + W) = 48 \u2192 L + 2W = 48.\n\nEquation 2: 2*( L + (W/2) ) = 66 \u2192 Let's simplify.\n\n2*(L + W/2) = 66 \u2192 2L + W = 66.\n\nNow I have two equations:\n\n1. L + 2W = 48\n2. 2L + W = 66\n\nI need to solve for L and W.\n\nLet me write them again:\n\nEquation 1: L + 2W = 48 \u2192 L = 48 - 2W.\n\nEquation 2: 2L + W = 66.\n\nSubstitute L from Equation 1 into Equation 2.\n\n2*(48 - 2W) + W = 66 \u2192 Let's compute that.\n\n2*48 is 96, 2*(-2W) is -4W. So 96 -4W + W = 66.\n\nCombine like terms: 96 -3W = 66.\n\nSubtract 96 from both sides: -3W = 66 -96 \u2192 -3W = -30.\n\nDivide both sides by -3: W = (-30)/(-3) = 10 cm.\n\nNow plug W back into Equation 1 to find L.\n\nL + 2*(10) = 48 \u2192 L +20 =48 \u2192 L=28 cm.\n\nSo the original sheet has length 28 cm and width 10 cm. Wait, wait, wait a second. Wait, that can't be right because if you fold along the length, the perimeter is 48 cm. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, let's double-check the substitution.\n\nEquation 1: L =48 -2W.\n\nEquation 2: 2L + W =66.\n\nSubstituting L: 2*(48 - 2W) + W = 66 \u2192 96 -4W + W = 66 \u2192 96 -3W=66 \u2192 96-66=3W \u2192 30=3W \u2192 W=10. That's correct.\n\nThen L=48-2*(10)=28 cm.\n\nSo the original sheet is 28 cm by 10 cm.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's compute the perimeters when folded.\n\nWhen folded along the length: each half is 14 cm (28/2) by 10 cm. Perimeter is 2*(14+10)=2*24=48 cm. That's correct.\n\nWhen folded along the width: each half is 28 cm by 5 cm (10/2). Perimeter is 2*(28+5)=2*33=66 cm. Correct.\n\nSo the area of the original sheet is L*W =28 *10=280 cm\u00b2. Wait, but the options given are way larger than that. Wait, looking at the options:\n\nOptions are A)1584, B)1120, C)792, D)1320, E)1200. All in the thousands. That's way larger than 280. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I got the folding direction wrong. Maybe I assigned L and W incorrectly. Because 28*10=280 is nowhere near the options given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that when folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter is 66 cm. So perhaps I made a mistake in assigning which is length and which is width.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the setup.\n\nWait, when you fold the sheet into two equal halves along one set of sides, perhaps you're actually halving the other dimension. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I mixed up the way I set up the equations.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's denote the original rectangle as having length L and width W.\n\nWhen folded along the length (i.e., along the length's side), each half has dimensions L/2 by W. The perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = (L + 2W) = 48 cm.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each half has dimensions L by W/2. The perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) = (2L + W) = 66 cm.\n\nSo the equations are correct as before.\n\nWait, but perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Because according to this, the area would be 280 cm\u00b2, but the options are much higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe when folding the sheet, the other dimension remains the same, but the side along which it's folded is halved. So perhaps I have to think about the perimeters correctly.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me consider that when you fold the sheet along one pair of sides, you are making two smaller rectangles. The way you fold could affect the dimensions.\n\nWait, perhaps when folded along the length, the resulting smaller rectangles have dimensions W and L/2. So for each small rectangle, perimeter is 2*(W + L/2) = 48 cm.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, each small rectangle has dimensions L and W/2, so perimeter 2*(L + W/2) = 66 cm.\n\nWait, but that's what I did before. So the equations are the same.\n\nSo why is the area coming out so small? Let's see the options again. The options are all in the hundreds, but 280 is not among them. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the perimeters are for the folded halves, but perhaps I should model the perimeters correctly.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate the equations.\n\nEquation 1: 2*( (L/2) + W ) =48 \u2192 2*( L/2 + W )=48 \u2192 L + 2W =48 \u2192 Correct.\n\nEquation 2: 2*( L + W/2 )=66 \u2192 2L + W =66 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo solving:\n\nFrom equation 1: L =48 -2W.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2: 2*(48-2W) + W =66 \u2192 96 -4W + W =66 \u2192 96 -3W =66 \u2192 3W=30 \u2192 W=10.\n\nThen L=48-2*10=28 cm.\n\nSo area is 28*10=280 cm\u00b2. But the options don't have 280. Hmm. So I must have made a mistake in setting up the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me read it again.\n\n\"When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides.\"\n\nWait, wait. So when folded along one set of sides, each part has a perimeter of 48. When folded along the other set, each part has a perimeter of 66.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are for the entire folded sheet, not each half? No, no, the question says 'each part' so each half.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the perimeters differently. Another approach: when you fold the sheet along one side, the resulting shape is a smaller rectangle, and each part has a perimeter.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are for the folded shape, not each half. Wait, that's confusing. Let me think.\n\nWait, when you fold a rectangle along one of its sides, you're effectively making two layers, but each part is a smaller rectangle. So when you fold along the length, each part is L/2 by W. So the perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48 cm.\n\nWhen you fold along the width, each part is L by W/2. So perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W =66 cm.\n\nSo the equations are correct. But the area is 28*10=280, which is not in the options.\n\nSo perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps when the sheet is folded into two equal halves, the resulting shape is a rectangle of half the area, but the perimeter is for the folded sheet. So perhaps the perimeters are for the folded sheet, which is a larger rectangle, not each half.\n\nWait, that makes no sense. Because when you fold, each half is a smaller rectangle. Wait, but perhaps when you fold along one side, the resulting folded sheet is a rectangle of dimensions L/2 by W, and the perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the perimeters of the folded sheets. But in that case, each folded sheet would be a smaller rectangle, so the perimeters are as I calculated before.\n\nBut if that leads to the area being 280, which isn't an option, then perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, maybe the folding is along the longer side, making the halves have different perimeters. Alternatively, perhaps I should assign the variables differently.\n\nLet me try assigning L and W differently. Suppose that when you fold along the length, each half is W by L/2. So when you fold along length L, each half has dimensions W and L/2.\n\nWait, but that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should let the length be the longer side, but perhaps in the problem, the longer side is W and the shorter is L. But that shouldn't affect the equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeters are not of the folded parts, but of the entire sheet when folded. Wait, that doesn't make sense because when you fold, the sheet's perimeter changes.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the perimeters given are for the folded sheet as a whole, not each part. So when you fold along one set of sides, the folded sheet has a perimeter of 48 cm. And when folded along the other set, the perimeter is 66 cm.\n\nWait, that would make more sense, perhaps. Let me model that.\n\nSo, when folded along one set of sides, the sheet becomes a rectangle of dimensions L/2 and W. So the perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48 cm.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the other set of sides, the dimensions are L and W/2, so perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) =2L + W =66 cm.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So same equations, leading to L=28, W=10, area 280.\n\nBut the options are all way higher. So perhaps the initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters given are for the entire sheet, not the folded ones. No, that doesn't make sense because when you fold, the sheet's dimensions change.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think that when you fold along one set of sides, the sheet is folded along its length, making the perimeter of the folded sheet 48 cm. And when folded along the other set, the perimeter is 66 cm.\n\nWait, that's the same as before.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded into two equal parts, but perhaps the folding is along the other dimension. For example, when folding along the length, each half is L/2 by W, but perhaps the perimeters are for the entire sheet after folding, which would have two layers but the same dimensions as each half.\n\nWait, but no, the problem states that each part has a perimeter. So each folded half is a rectangle, and each has a perimeter of 48 or 66.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that when you fold the sheet along one pair of sides, each of the two parts (halves) has a perimeter of 48 cm. So each half is a rectangle, and their perimeters are 48.\n\nWait, but each half is a rectangle, so their perimeters are as I calculated before.\n\nBut the area of the original sheet is L*W=28*10=280. But that's not among the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, 28 cm by 10 cm gives area 280. But the options are way larger.\n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up the equations.\n\nLet me try solving the equations again.\n\nEquation 1: L + 2W =48 \u2192 (1)\n\nEquation 2: 2L + W=66 \u2192 (2)\n\nFrom equation (1): L =48-2W.\n\nSubstitute into equation (2):\n\n2*(48-2W) + W =66 \u2192 96 -4W + W =66 \u2192 96-3W=66 \u2192 3W=96-66=30 \u2192 W=10 cm.\n\nL=48-2*10=28 cm.\n\nHmm. So that's correct.\n\nWait, maybe I should think that when folding along one set of sides, the perimeter is 48 cm, but perhaps that's the sum of both halves' perimeters. No, the problem says each part has a perimeter of 48 cm.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps the problem is that each part's perimeter is 48 cm when folded along one set of sides, and when folded along the other set, each part has a perimeter of 66 cm.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So the equations are correct.\n\nHmm. But the answer is 280, which is not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equations.\n\nWait, maybe the perimeters are calculated differently. Let me think again.\n\nWhen you fold the sheet along one side, you're effectively creating a new rectangle. Let's say the original rectangle is L by W.\n\nFolding along the length (i.e., along the length's sides) would make each half have dimensions L/2 by W. So the perimeter of each half is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48.\n\nFolding along the width (along the width's sides) makes each half have dimensions L by W/2. So the perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) =2L + W=66.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write the equations as:\n\nPerimeter when folded along length: 2*( (L/2) + W ) =48 \u2192 L + 2W=48.\n\nPerimeter when folded along width: 2*(L + (W/2) )=66 \u2192 2L + W=66.\n\nYes, same equations. So same solution.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the problem is in the units. The options are in cm\u00b2, but perhaps they are in meters? No, the perimeters are given in cm, so the area would be in cm\u00b2.\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check the initial problem statement.\n\nThe problem says \"When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides.\"\n\nHmm. So each part has a perimeter of 48 and 66 when folded along each set of sides.\n\nWait, maybe I should model this differently. Let's suppose that when you fold along the length, the sheet is divided into two parts each of which is L/2 by W. Each has a perimeter of 48.\n\nSimilarly, when you fold along the width, each part is L by W/2, each with a perimeter of 66.\n\nSo the equations are correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is that when you fold along the length, the sheet is folded along the width? Maybe I mixed up the terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem refers to folding along the longer sides or shorter sides, but that shouldn't affect the equations.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the problem is that when you fold along one set of sides, you're halving the other dimension. So when you fold along the length, you're halving the width.\n\nWait, no, that can't be. Folding along the length would halve the length.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of the sheet as being folded along the length, so the length becomes L/2, but the width remains W. So the perimeter would be 2*( (L/2) + W )= L + 2W=48.\n\nSame as before.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let me see the options again. The options are:\n\nA)1584\n\nB)1120\n\nC)792\n\nD)1320\n\nE)1200\n\nThese are all much larger than 280. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when folding the sheet, the perimeters are for the folded sheet as a whole, not each half. So when folded along one set of sides, the entire sheet becomes a rectangle of L/2 by W, and the perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W=48.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the other set, the entire sheet is L by W/2, perimeter 2*(L + W/2)=2L + W=66.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So the equations are correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the sheet is folded into two parts, but each part is a square? No, the problem says rectangular sheet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of the perimeters as the sum of the perimeters of both halves. But that would be double the perimeter of each half.\n\nWait, that's a possibility. Let me think.\n\nSo if each part's perimeter is 48 cm, and there are two parts, then the total perimeter would be 96 cm. But that doesn't make sense because when you fold, you're not adding perimeters; you're changing the shape.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the perimeters given are for the entire sheet after folding, not each half. So when you fold along one set of sides, the sheet's perimeter becomes 48 cm, and when folded along the other, it becomes 66 cm.\n\nWait, that would make more sense, perhaps. Let me model that.\n\nSo when you fold the sheet along one set of sides, the new sheet has dimensions L/2 by W. Its perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48.\n\nWhen you fold along the other set of sides, the new sheet has dimensions L by W/2. Perimeter is 2*(L + W/2)= 2L + W=66.\n\nSame equations as before.\n\nSo same solution: L=28, W=10. Area is 280 cm\u00b2. Not in the options.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the problem is that I'm not interpreting the perimeters correctly.\n\nWait, maybe when you fold the sheet, the perimeter is the sum of the perimeters of both halves. So each half has a perimeter of 48, and there are two halves, so total perimeter would be 96. But that doesn't fit with the problem statement, which says each part has a perimeter of 48.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think that when you fold the sheet, the perimeter of the folded sheet is the sum of the perimeters of the two halves minus twice the fold line. Because when you fold, you're bringing two edges together, so the perimeter would be the sum of the two perimeters minus twice the length of the fold.\n\nHmm, that's a more complicated approach. Let me try that.\n\nWhen you fold along the length, each half has a perimeter of 48 cm. So the perimeter of each half is 48. The folded sheet's perimeter would be the sum of the perimeters of both halves minus twice the folded edge (since the fold is internal and not part of the outer perimeter).\n\nSo the folded sheet's perimeter is 48*2 - 2*(L/2)*2. Wait, perhaps not.\n\nWait, when you fold a sheet along one side, the two halves are connected along that side, so the perimeter of the folded sheet would be the sum of the perimeters of the two halves minus twice the length of the fold (since each half contributes the fold as an internal edge, not part of the perimeter).\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeter of the folded sheet is (perimeter of one half) + (perimeter of the other half) - 2*(folded length). Because each half has the folded edge, which becomes internal.\n\nSo for each half, the perimeter is 48 cm. So two halves would have a total perimeter of 96 cm, but the folded sheet's perimeter is 96 - 2*(folded length)*2.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the perimeter of the folded sheet is the same as the perimeter of each half, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when the sheet is folded, the perimeter is not of each half but of the entire folded sheet. Let me think.\n\nBut earlier approach gave area 280, which isn't an option. So perhaps I should try a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when the sheet is folded along one set of sides, the resulting shape is a rectangle of perimeter 48 cm, but each part is a square. No, the problem says rectangular sheet.\n\nWait, perhaps I should let the original sheet have length L and width W. When folded along the length, each half is L/2 by W, and the perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each half is L by W/2, perimeter 2*(L + W/2) =2L + W=66.\n\nSolving these, L=28, W=10. Area=280 cm\u00b2.\n\nBut since this isn't an option, perhaps the problem is that I have the perimeters mixed up. Maybe the 48 cm is when folded along the width, and 66 when folded along the length.\n\nWait, let me try that. Let me swap the equations.\n\nEquation 1: 2*( L + W/2 )=48 \u2192 2L + W =48.\n\nEquation 2: 2*(L/2 + W )=66 \u2192 L +2W=66.\n\nSo now, equation 1: 2L + W =48.\n\nEquation 2: L +2W=66.\n\nLet me solve these.\n\nFrom equation 1: W=48-2L.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2: L + 2*(48-2L)=66 \u2192 L +96 -4L=66 \u2192 -3L +96=66 \u2192 -3L= -30 \u2192 L=10.\n\nThen W=48-2*10=28.\n\nSo L=10 cm, W=28 cm.\n\nArea is 10*28=280 cm\u00b2. Still the same.\n\nHmm. Not matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think that when you fold along the length, the perimeter is 48, and when you fold along the width, the perimeter is 66. But perhaps the perimeters are for the entire sheet when folded, which would have a perimeter of 48 and 66.\n\nWait, so when folded along the length, the sheet becomes L/2 by W. So perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L +2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, it becomes L by W/2. Perimeter is 2*(L + W/2)=2L + W=66.\n\nSame equations as before. So same solution.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the problem is that the perimeters are for the entire sheet when folded, which would have a perimeter of 48 and 66, but I'm not getting the correct area.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think differently.\n\nLet me denote the original sheet as having length x and width y.\n\nWhen folded along the length, each half is (x/2) by y. Perimeter is 2*(x/2 + y) = x + 2y =48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each half is x by (y/2). Perimeter is 2*(x + y/2) = 2x + y =66.\n\nSo equations:\n\n1. x + 2y =48.\n\n2. 2x + y=66.\n\nLet me solve these equations.\n\nFrom equation 1: x=48-2y.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2: 2*(48-2y) + y=66 \u219296 -4y +y=66 \u219296 -3y=66 \u2192 3y=30 \u2192 y=10.\n\nx=48-2*10=28.\n\nSo x=28, y=10. Area=28*10=280 cm\u00b2.\n\nSame result. So perhaps the problem is that the options are given in a different unit, but the question says cm, so that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says the perimeters are 48 cm when folded along one set, and 66 cm when folded along the other. So each part has a perimeter of 48 and 66.\n\nWait, perhaps each part's perimeter is 48 when folded along the length, and 66 when folded along the width. So each half is a rectangle with perimeter 48 when folded along the length, and 66 when folded along the width.\n\nWait, but that's the same as what I did earlier.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps I should check if the options are in meters instead of cm. But 280 cm\u00b2 is 0.028 m\u00b2, which is much smaller than the options given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the sheet is folded into two equal parts, but the perimeters are of the entire sheet after folding, not each half.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the perimeters as being for the entire folded sheet, not each half.\n\nSo when you fold along the length, the sheet becomes L/2 by W. So the perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W)= L +2W =48.\n\nWhen you fold along the width, it becomes L by W/2. Perimeter is 2*(L + W/2)=2L + W=66.\n\nSame equations again. So same solution.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the problem is that I'm not interpreting the perimeters correctly, or perhaps there's a mistake in the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when the sheet is folded along one set of sides, each part is a square. But the problem states it's a rectangular sheet, so each part would also be a rectangle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the perimeters are of the folded sheet plus the fold line. No, that's not standard.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the perimeters are for the two halves combined.\n\nWait, if each half has a perimeter of 48 cm, then two halves have a total perimeter of 96 cm. But that would be the perimeter of the original sheet, which is 2*(L + W)=96.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the other set, each half's perimeter is 66, so 2*66=132 cm. So 2*(L + W)=132.\n\nBut that would mean 2*(L+W)=96 and 2*(L+W)=132, which is impossible. So that approach can't be correct.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck here. Let me try to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sheet is folded into two parts, but the perimeters are not of each half but of the entire folded structure.\n\nWait, when you fold a sheet along one side, the perimeter of the folded sheet would be the same as the perimeter of one half, because the folded edge is internal. So perhaps the perimeter of the folded sheet is 48 cm when folded along one set, and 66 cm when folded along the other.\n\nSo the perimeter when folded along the length is 48 cm. So 2*(L/2 + W)=48 \u2192 L +2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, 2*(L + W/2)=66 \u2192 2L + W=66.\n\nSame equations. So same solution.\n\nSo I'm back to area 280, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think that the perimeters are for the sheet after folding, but the sheet is folded twice, so the perimeters are different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that when folded along one set of sides, each part is a square. Let me explore that.\n\nIf when folded along one set of sides, each part is a square, then L/2 = W.\n\nSo L=2W.\n\nThen the perimeter when folded along that set is 2*(L/2 + W)=2*(W + W)=4W=48 \u2192 W=12 cm. So L=24 cm.\n\nThen when folded along the other set of sides, each part is L by W/2. So the perimeter would be 2*(L + W/2)=2*(24 +6)=2*30=60 cm. But the problem states that the perimeter is 66 cm. So that's not matching.\n\nSo that's not the case.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps when folded along one set, the halves are squares, but when folded along the other, they are rectangles.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't state that. It just says rectangular sheet.\n\nI'm really stuck. Let me think about the options. Let's see what the options would imply.\n\nOption E is 1200 cm\u00b2. So perhaps L and W are 30 and 40 cm, since 30*40=1200.\n\nLet me see if that fits the equations.\n\nIf L=40, W=30.\n\nEquation 1: L + 2W=40 +60=100\u226048. So no.\n\nAlternatively, L=30, W=40.\n\nEquation 1: 30+80=110\u226048.\n\nHmm.\n\nOption D is 1320. Let's see if 1320 can be factored into L and W that fit the equations.\n\n1320= L * W.\n\nSuppose L=44, W=30 \u2192 44*30=1320.\n\nCheck equation 1: 44 +2*30=44+60=104\u226048.\n\nNope.\n\nAnother option: L=60, W=22. 60*22=1320.\n\nEquation1:60 +44=104\u226048.\n\nNo.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, L=24, W=55.\n\n24*55=1320.\n\nEquation1:24 +110=134\u226048.\n\nNo.\n\nHmm. Option C is 792. Let's see.\n\nPossible factors: 22 *36=792.\n\nEquation1:22 +2*36=22+72=94\u226048.\n\nNope.\n\nAnother factor pair: 33 *24=792.\n\nEquation1:33 +48=81\u226048.\n\nNo.\n\nHmm. Option B is 1120.\n\nFactors: 32 *35=1120.\n\nEquation1:32 +70=102\u226048.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother pair: 28*40=1120.\n\nEquation1:28 +80=108\u226048.\n\nNo.\n\nHmm. Option A:1584.\n\nPossible factors: 33 *48=1584.\n\nEquation1:33 +96=129\u226048.\n\nNo.\n\nHmm. None of the options fit the equations I've set up. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think that when folded along one set of sides, each part has a perimeter of 48 cm, and when folded along the other set, each part has a perimeter of 66 cm. But perhaps I should model the perimeters as the sum of the perimeters of both halves.\n\nWait, for example, when folded along the length, each half has a perimeter of 48 cm. So two halves would have a total perimeter of 96 cm. But the original sheet's perimeter is 2*(L+W).\n\nBut when folded along the length, each half is L/2 by W, so each has a perimeter of 2*(L/2 + W)=L +2W=48.\n\nTwo halves would have a total perimeter of 2*48=96 cm.\n\nBut the original sheet's perimeter is 2*(L + W).\n\nHmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeter when folded is the sum of the perimeters of the two halves minus twice the folded edge.\n\nSo when folded along the length, each half has a perimeter of 48 cm. So the total perimeter would be 2*48 - 2*(L/2)*2 = 96 - 2L.\n\nBut when folded, the sheet's perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W=48.\n\nSo 96 -2L=48 \u2192 2L=48 \u2192 L=24 cm.\n\nThen, from equation 1: L +2W=48 \u219224 +2W=48 \u21922W=24 \u2192 W=12 cm.\n\nSo L=24, W=12. Area=24*12=288 cm\u00b2. Still not matching the options.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the perimeter when folded is the sum of the perimeters of both halves minus the length of the fold times two.\n\nSo when you fold along the length, each half has a perimeter of 48 cm. So the folded sheet's perimeter is 48 +48 - 2*(L/2) = 96 - L.\n\nBut the folded sheet's perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W)= L + 2W=48.\n\nSo 96 - L = L +2W \u2192 96 =2L +2W \u2192 L + W=48.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, the perimeter would be 48 (each half) *2 - 2*(W/2) \u2192 96 - W =2*(L + W/2)=2L + W=66.\n\nSo now, we have two equations:\n\n1. L + W =48.\n\n2. 2L + W=66.\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(2L + W) - (L + W) )=66-48 \u2192 L=18.\n\nThen from equation 1:18 + W=48 \u2192 W=30.\n\nSo area is 18*30=540 cm\u00b2. Still not matching the options.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. Let me think of another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters given are for the sheet when folded along one set of sides, and the other set of sides, but in the same sheet. So when folded along length, the sheet's perimeter is 48, and when folded along width, the perimeter is 66.\n\nSo when folded along length: sheet becomes L/2 by W. Perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W)=L +2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along width: sheet becomes L by W/2. Perimeter is 2*(L + W/2)=2L + W=66.\n\nSo same equations as before. Same solution: L=28, W=10. Area 280.\n\nBut that's not an option. So perhaps the problem is in the way I'm interpreting the folding.\n\nWait, perhaps when folding along one set of sides, the sheet is folded along the length, making the new length W, and the width L/2.\n\nWait, maybe I got length and width swapped.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded along its width, making each half have dimensions L by W/2. So when folded along the width, each half has perimeter 2*(L + W/2)=66.\n\nAnd when folded along the length, each half has dimensions L/2 by W, perimeter 2*(L/2 + W)=48.\n\nSame equations.\n\nWait, perhaps I should swap L and W.\n\nLet me try that. Let me let L=10, W=28.\n\nThen equation 1:10 +2*28=66. No, because equation 1 is L+2W=48.\n\nWait, 10+56=66\u226048. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck here. I think I've tried all possible approaches, and the only solution I get is 280 cm\u00b2, which isn't an option. So perhaps the problem is that I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, another thought: Perhaps the sheet is folded into two equal parts along one set of sides, but the resulting perimeters are for both parts combined.\n\nWait, for example, when folded along the length, each half has a perimeter of 48 cm, so together, both halves have a perimeter of 96 cm. But the original sheet's perimeter is 2*(L+W).\n\nBut when you fold the sheet along the length, each half is L/2 by W. So each has a perimeter of 2*(L/2 + W)=L+2W=48.\n\nSo two halves would have 2*(L+2W)=96. Which would mean the original sheet's perimeter is 2*(L+W) = 96 - L.\n\nBut I'm not sure how that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeter given is the sum of the perimeters of both halves when folded along one set of sides.\n\nSo when folded along the length, each half has a perimeter of 48 cm. So total perimeter for both halves is 96 cm.\n\nBut the original sheet's perimeter is 2*(L + W).\n\nSo 2*(L + W) =96 \u2192 L + W=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each half has a perimeter of 66 cm. So total perimeter for both halves is 132 cm.\n\nThus, 2*(L + W)=132 \u2192 L + W=66.\n\nBut that's impossible, because L + W can't be both 48 and 66.\n\nSo that approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll have to conclude that perhaps the correct answer is 280, but since it's not among the options, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think that the perimeters given are for the entire sheet when folded, not each half. So when folded along the length, the sheet's perimeter is 48 cm. So 2*(L/2 + W)=48 \u2192 L+2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, the sheet's perimeter is 66 cm. So 2*(L + W/2)=66 \u21922L + W=66.\n\nSo same equations. So same solution.\n\nWait, perhaps the area is (28 *10)*2=560. No, that's not an option either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the area as (L/2 * W)*2= L*W. So same as before.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. I think I'll have to go with the initial solution of 280, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think that when the sheet is folded along one set of sides, each part has a perimeter of 48 cm. So each half has a perimeter of 48.\n\nBut perhaps the perimeter is not of the half but of the folded sheet, which includes both layers.\n\nWait, perhaps when you fold the sheet along the length, the folded sheet has a perimeter of 48 cm, but each half is still a rectangle of dimensions L/2 by W.\n\nSo the perimeter of the folded sheet is 2*(L/2 + W)=48 \u2192 L+2W=48.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, the folded sheet has a perimeter of 2*(L + W/2)=66 \u21922L + W=66.\n\nSame equations.\n\nHmm.\n\nWell, I think I've tried all possible approaches, and the only solution I get is 280 cm\u00b2, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I should assign the perimeters to the other equations.\n\nLet me try:\n\nEquation 1: 2*( L + W/2 )=48 \u2192 2L + W=48.\n\nEquation 2: 2*( L/2 + W )=66 \u2192 L +2W=66.\n\nNow, solve these equations.\n\nEquation 1: 2L + W=48.\n\nEquation 2: L +2W=66.\n\nMultiply equation 2 by 2: 2L +4W=132.\n\nSubtract equation 1: (2L +4W) - (2L + W) )=132-48 \u21923W=84 \u2192 W=28.\n\nThen from equation 2: L + 2*28=66 \u2192 L=66-56=10.\n\nSo L=10 cm, W=28 cm.\n\nArea=10*28=280 cm\u00b2. Same result.\n\nHmm. So I'm confident that the area is 280 cm\u00b2, but it's not among the options. So perhaps the problem is misprinted, or I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeters are for the entire sheet when folded, but I've done that already.\n\nWell, given that I can't find any other approach, I'll have to conclude that the answer is 280 cm\u00b2. But since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the perimeters are for the entire sheet when folded, but the sheet is folded twice, once along each set of sides, and the perimeters are for each of the folded sheets.\n\nWait, but that would mean two different folded sheets, each with their own perimeter.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded along one set of sides, then along the other. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeters are for the same sheet after both folds. But that complicates things further.\n\nI think I've exhausted all possibilities. I'll have to go with the initial solution, but since it's not among the options, perhaps the correct answer is 280, but it's not listed.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me try to model it differently.\n\nLet me assume that when the sheet is folded along one set of sides, the resulting shape is a square. So each half is a square.\n\nSo when folded along the length, each half is a square with side length a. So L/2 = a and W =a.\n\nSo L=2a, W=a.\n\nPerimeter of each half:4a=48 \u2192a=12 cm.\n\nSo L=24 cm, W=12 cm.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each half is a square with side length b. So W/2 =b, L=b.\n\nSo W=2b, L=b.\n\nPerimeter of each half:4b=66 \u2192 b=16.5 cm.\n\nBut L=b=16.5 cm, W=2b=33 cm.\n\nBut earlier, from the first fold, L=24 cm, W=12 cm.\n\nWhich contradicts the second fold's results.\n\nSo this approach is invalid.\n\nThus, the only possible conclusion is that the area is 280 cm\u00b2, which isn't among the options. So perhaps the correct answer is missing, or I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the sheet is folded into two equal parts, but each part is a square. So when folded along the length, each part is a square, and when folded along the width, each part is a square.\n\nBut that would require L/2 = W and W/2 = L.\n\nWhich implies L/2 = W and W/2 = L \u2192 substituting, L/2 = W \u2192 W= L/2.\n\nBut W/2 = L \u2192 (L/2)/2 = L \u2192 L/4 = L \u2192 L=0. Which is impossible.\n\nThus, that approach is invalid.\n\nI think I've tried all possible approaches, and the only possible solution is 280 cm\u00b2. But since it's not an option, perhaps the problem is incorrect, or I made a mistake somewhere.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the area of a rectangular sheet based on the perimeters of its halves when folded along two different sets of sides. Let the original sheet have length \\( L \\) and width \\( W \\). When folded along one set of sides, each half has dimensions \\( \\frac{L}{2} \\times W \\), and the perimeter of each half is given as 48 cm. When folded along the other set of sides, each half has dimensions \\( L \\times \\frac{W}{2} \\), and the perimeter of each half is given as 66 cm.\n\n### Step 1: Setting up the equations\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is \\( 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width}) \\). Using the given perimeters:\n\n1. When folded along the length:\n   \\[\n   2 \\left( \\frac{L}{2} + W \\right) = 48 \\implies L + 2W = 48\n   \\]\n\n2. When folded along the width:\n   \\[\n   2 \\left( L + \\frac{W}{2} \\right) = 66 \\implies 2L + W = 66\n   \\]\n\n### Step 2: Solving the system of equations\nFrom the first equation:\n\\[\nL = 48 - 2W\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( L = 48 - 2W \\) into the second equation:\n\\[\n2(48 - 2W) + W = 66 \\implies 96 - 4W + W = 66 \\implies 96 - 3W = 66 \\implies 3W = 30 \\implies W = 10\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( W = 10 \\) back into \\( L = 48 - 2W \\):\n\\[\nL = 48 - 2(10) = 28\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the area\nThe area of the original sheet is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = L \\times W = 28 \\times 10 = 280 \\, \\text{cm}^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Comparing with the options\nThe calculated area of \\( 280 \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\) does not match any of the provided options:  \n**A) 1584, B) 1120, C) 792, D) 1320, E) 1200**.  \n\nThis discrepancy suggests either an issue with the problem setup, the interpretation of the perimeters, or the provided options. Based on the calculations, the area of the sheet is \\( 280 \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\), but since this is not among the options, the correct answer cannot be determined from the given choices.\n\nANSWER: None of the options match the calculated area.",
