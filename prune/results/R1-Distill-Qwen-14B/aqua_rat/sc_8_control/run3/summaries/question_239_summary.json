      "full_content": "Okay, let's try to figure this problem out. So, the question says that exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls. There are 100 boys in the class, and we need to find out how many girls there are. Hmm.\n\nAlright, first, I'll try to understand the problem. The class has some number of children, and out of them, 2/5 are girls. That means the rest must be boys. Wait, so if 2/5 are girls, then the boys must make up the remaining fraction. Let me think, 1 (which represents the whole) minus 2/5 is 3/5. So boys are 3/5 of the class, right?\n\nThe problem states there are 100 boys. So if 3/5 of the total class equals 100 boys, I can set up an equation to find the total number of students. Let me denote the total number of children as T.\n\nSo, (3/5) * T = 100. To find T, I can rearrange this equation. Multiply both sides by 5/3. That would give T = 100 * (5/3). Let me calculate that. 100 divided by 3 is approximately 33.333, but multiplied by 5 gives about 166.666. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the number of children should be a whole number. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check my fractions again. The problem says 2/5 are girls, so the boys are 3/5. So yes, 3/5 T = 100. Solving for T, T = 100 * (5/3) = 500/3. That's about 166.666. Hmm, that's a fraction, but the number of children can't be a fraction. Did I get something wrong?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is structured differently. Let me read it again. It says exactly 2/5 are girls, and there are 100 boys. So perhaps I should think about the ratio of boys to girls. The ratio of boys to total is 3/5, and girls are 2/5. So if 3/5 equals 100, then 2/5 would be (2/5)*T, which is the number of girls.\n\nWait, let me think about it another way. The total number of children is T. Girls are (2/5)T, boys are (3/5)T. And the boys are 100. So (3/5)T = 100. So T is 100 * (5/3) = 500/3 \u2248 166.666. But since the number of children must be whole, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, but perhaps the question is correct, and I'm just miscalculating. Let's compute it again. 100 divided by (3/5) is the same as 100 multiplied by 5/3. So 100 *5=500, divided by 3 is approximately 166.666. But since the number of children can't be a fraction, perhaps the problem expects us to have a whole number, so maybe I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total number of children is 500/3, but that's about 166.666, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I should approach it differently. Let's think of the number of girls as G and boys as B.\n\nWe know that G = (2/5) * (G + B). Also, B is given as 100. So substituting B=100 into the equation: G = (2/5)(G + 100). Let's solve for G.\n\nMultiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the denominator: 5G = 2(G + 100). That becomes 5G = 2G + 200. Subtract 2G from both sides: 3G = 200. So G = 200 / 3, which is approximately 66.666. Wait, that's a fractional number of girls, which isn't possible either. Hmm, so both the total number and the number of girls are fractional. That doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the equation. Let me check again. The equation was G = (2/5)(G + B), with B=100. So, 5G = 2G + 200. 5G-2G=3G=200. So G=200/3, which is about 66.666. But that's not a whole number. So perhaps the problem is designed in a way that the numbers come out as whole numbers. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the fractions.\n\nWait, another approach: If 3/5 of the class are boys and that's 100, then 1/5 of the class is 100 /3 \u2248 33.333. Then 2/5 would be twice that, which is about 66.666. So that's the number of girls. But since you can't have a fraction of a child, maybe the question expects us to have a fractional answer, but that's not possible in reality. Or perhaps the problem is designed with these numbers for some reason.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, the choices are A)50, B)100, C)150, D)200, E)70. So none of these options are 66.666. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nHmm, maybe I should re-examine the problem statement. It says exactly 2/5 of the children are girls. So the girls are 2/5, boys are 3/5. So if boys are 3/5 and that's 100, then total is (100) / (3/5) = 100 *5/3 = 500/3 \u2248166.666. So the number of girls would be 2/5 * T, which is 2/5 * 500/3 = (1000/15) = 200/3 \u224866.666. But again, that's not an option.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm misreading the problem. It says 2/5 are girls, so 3/5 are boys. So if boys are 3/5 and that equals 100, then total is (100) * (5/3) = 500/3. That's approximately 166.666, which isn't a whole number. So either I'm making a mistake, or perhaps the problem has a typo. But since this is a multiple-choice question, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed. But that's unlikely. So maybe I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, another possibility: Perhaps the problem says that 2/5 of the class are girls, meaning that the girls are 2 parts and boys are 3 parts, making a total of 5 parts. So each part is equal. So if boys are 3 parts, which equal 100, then one part is 100/3 \u224833.333. Girls are 2 parts, so 2 * (100/3) \u224866.666. But again, none of the options match that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've inverted the fractions. Maybe the boys are 2/5 and girls 3/5. No, the question says 2/5 are girls, so that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the class has girls and boys only. So total is G + B. So G = (2/5)(G + B). B is 100. So substituting, G = (2/5)(G +100). Multiply both sides by 5:5G=2(G+100). 5G=2G+200. 3G=200 \u2192 G=200/3 \u224866.666. Again, same result. So the number of girls is approximately 66.666, which isn't an option.\n\nBut the options are A)50, B)100, C)150, D)200, E)70.\n\nHmm, none of these match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is that the girls are 2/5 of the boys? No, the problem says girls are 2/5 of the class. So that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the question says 2/5 of the children are girls, so girls are 2 parts, boys are 3 parts. So if boys are 100, which is 3 parts, each part is 100/3 \u224833.333. So girls would be 2 parts, which is 66.666. But the options don't have that.\n\nWait, looking at the options again: A)50, B)100, C)150, D)200, E)70. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not about parts but about percentages. So 2/5 are girls, which is 40%. So 40% are girls, 60% are boys. If 60% equals 100 boys, then 10% is 100/6 = approximately 16.666. So total is 100% which is 10 * 16.666 = 166.666. Girls would be 40%, which is 4 *16.666 \u224866.666. Again, same issue.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have girls as 2/5 of the boys. But that would be a different setup. Let me test that. If girls are 2/5 of the boys, then girls = (2/5)*100=40. But 40 isn't an option either. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Let me think of the total number of students as T. Girls are (2/5) T, boys are (3/5) T. Boys are 100, so (3/5) T = 100 \u2192 T= (100 *5)/3=500/3\u2248166.666. So girls would be (2/5)*T = (2/5)*(500/3) = (1000/15)=200/3\u224866.666. But again, this isn't an option.\n\nWait, looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is option E)70, but that's 70. 70 is close to 66.666, but not exactly. Or perhaps I'm making a mistake in the fractions.\n\nWait, let me try another way. Suppose the total number of students is 5 parts. Girls are 2 parts, boys are 3 parts. So each part is 100/3\u224833.333. Girls would be 2 parts, which is 66.666. So the number of girls is 66.666, but since that's not an option, perhaps the problem has a typo or I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that I'm considering the class as just girls and boys, but maybe there are other children. But the question says 'children in a certain class', which usually implies all students are boys and girls unless specified otherwise. So I think that's not the case.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial ratio. Let me re-express it. If girls are 2/5 of the class, then boys are 3/5. So if 3/5 is 100, then 1/5 is 100/3\u224833.333. So total is 5*(100/3)=500/3\u2248166.666. So girls are 2*(100/3)=200/3\u224866.666. But this isn't an option. So perhaps the answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the fraction. Maybe the problem says 2/5 are boys, not girls. Let me check. No, the problem states girls are 2/5. So that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the number of girls, but the options are wrong. Or perhaps I'm making a calculation error.\n\nWait, let me try to calculate 500/3. 500 divided by 3 is 166.666..., which is correct. So 166.666 total students. Girls are 2/5 of that, which is 66.666, which is 66 and 2/3. So the number of girls is approximately 66.666, which is not an option. So perhaps the question is wrong, but that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is in the way the fractions are applied. Let me think of it as the girls being 2/5 of the boys. So girls = (2/5)*boys. Boys are 100. So girls would be (2/5)*100=40. But 40 isn't an option either.\n\nHmm, none of this is working. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let me think, perhaps the problem is that the girls are 2/5 of the total, which includes both girls and boys. So the total is T, girls = 2T/5, boys = T - 2T/5 = 3T/5. We know boys are 100, so 3T/5=100 \u2192 T=500/3\u2248166.666. So girls are 2/5 * T = 2/5 * 500/3 = 200/3\u224866.666. So girls \u224866.666. But the options don't include this.\n\nWait, the options given are A)50, B)100, C)150, D)200, E)70. So perhaps the correct answer is not among them, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that 2/5 are girls, and the total number of children is such that when you subtract the boys, you get a whole number. So let me think. Let T be the total number of children. Then:\n\nGirls = (2/5)T\n\nBoys = T - (2/5)T = (3/5)T\n\nWe are told that boys are 100, so (3/5)T = 100 \u2192 T= (100 *5)/3 = 500/3\u2248166.666.\n\nBut since T must be a whole number, perhaps 500/3 is 166.666, which isn't a whole number. So this suggests that the problem has no solution with whole numbers, but that's impossible because you can't have a fraction of a child.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is designed with an incorrect setup. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations. Let me recompute.\n\n3/5 of T is 100. So T=100/(3/5)=100*(5/3)=500/3\u2248166.666. So that's correct. So the number of girls is (2/5)*T = (2/5)*(500/3)= (1000/15)= 66.666.\n\nSo the number of girls is 66.666, which isn't an option. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says 2/5 are girls, and 3/5 are boys, but the question is how many girls are there when there are 100 boys. So, perhaps I should think of the number of girls as (2/3) of the boys. Because if boys are 3/5 and girls are 2/5, then girls are (2/3) of the boys. Let me see.\n\nIf that's the case, then girls would be (2/3)*100 = 66.666. Again, same result. So no option matches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the class has 100 boys and 2/5 of the total are girls, so the total is T=boys + girls = 100 + G. And (2/5)T = G.\n\nSo substituting, (2/5)(100 + G) = G. Multiply both sides by 5: 2(100 + G)=5G \u2192 200 + 2G=5G \u2192 3G=200 \u2192 G=200/3\u224866.666. Same result.\n\nSo the number of girls is 66.666, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But that can't be the case because the options are provided.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the fractions. Let me think again. If girls are 2/5, then boys are 3/5. So 3/5 of the class are boys, which is 100. So 3 parts = 100, so 1 part = 33.333, and 2 parts = 66.666. So girls are 66.666.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, looking at the options again: A)50, B)100, C)150, D)200, E)70.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that the 2/5 refers to the number of girls in the class, but perhaps the class has more than just girls and boys. For example, maybe there are other children. But the problem states that 2/5 are girls, implying that the rest are boys, unless specified otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the class has 2/5 girls, and 3/5 boys, making a total of 5 parts. Boys are 3 parts =100 \u2192 each part is 33.333. So total is 5 parts, which is 166.666. Girls are 2 parts, 66.666. But again, not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I'm miscalculating the ratio. Let me try to think of the ratio of girls to boys. Girls are 2/5 of the class, so the ratio of girls to boys is 2:3. So for every 2 girls, there are 3 boys. So if there are 3 parts boys equal to 100, then each part is 100/3 \u224833.333. Girls are 2 parts, so 66.666.\n\nBut again, that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the number of girls when the boys are 100, so the girls would be 2/3 of that. 2/3 *100 is approximately 66.666. But that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem has a typo and the fraction is different. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the number of boys being 2/5, but no, the problem says girls are 2/5.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Let's think of the options. The closest option to 66.666 is E)70. But that's not exact. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me assume that the total number of students is 5n, where n is an integer. So girls are 2n, boys are 3n. Boys are 100, so 3n=100 \u2192 n=100/3 \u224833.333. So girls are 2n=66.666. So again, same result.\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer is 66.666, but it's not among the options. Therefore, perhaps the problem is incorrect, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the girls are 2/5 of the boys. Let me test that. So girls = (2/5)*boys. Boys=100. So girls=40. But 40 isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the girls are 2/5 of the total, which is T. So girls = 2T/5, boys = T - 2T/5 =3T/5=100 \u2192 T=500/3\u2248166.666. So girls=2*(500/3)/5=200/3\u224866.666. Still the same.\n\nHmm. I think I've tried all possible approaches. The answer should be 66.666, but it's not an option. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not listed. But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the 2/5 are girls, but that refers to the total number of girls, not the fraction. Wait, that doesn't make sense. No, the problem says 2/5 of the children are girls.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the class has 2/5 girls, and the rest are boys. So girls are 2/5, boys are 3/5. Boys are 100. So 3/5 T=100 \u2192 T=500/3\u2248166.666. Girls are 2/5 T=2/5*(500/3)=200/3\u224866.666. So again, same result.\n\nHmm. I think I'm stuck. The correct answer isn't among the options. But since this is a multiple-choice question, perhaps I've made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to round to the nearest whole number, making it 67. But that's not an option either.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the options again. Oh, option E is 70. Let me see if that makes sense. If girls were 70, then total T would be (70 *5)/2=175. So 3/5 of 175 is 105, which is more than the 100 boys given. So that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, option C is 150. Then T would be (150 *5)/2=375. Boys would be 3/5 *375=225, which is more than 100. So that's not correct.\n\nOption B is 100 girls. Then T would be (100*5)/2=250. Boys would be 3/5 *250=150. But the problem says boys are 100. So that's not correct.\n\nOption A is 50 girls. Then T= (50*5)/2=125. Boys=3/5*125=75. Which is less than 100. So not correct.\n\nOption D is 200 girls. T=(200 *5)/2=500. Boys=3/5*500=300, which is more than 100. So no.\n\nSo none of the options fit. Therefore, perhaps the problem is incorrect, or I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is in the ratio. Maybe the fraction is of the boys, not the class. So if girls are 2/5 of the boys, then girls= (2/5)*100=40. But 40 isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fraction is 2/5 of the girls. That doesn't make sense. I think I've exhausted all possibilities.\n\nSo, I'm forced to conclude that the correct answer is not among the options provided. But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended the girls to be 2/5 of the boys, but that leads to 40, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the problem. Let me try to think differently. If 2/5 are girls, then the ratio of girls to boys is 2:3. So for every 2 girls, there are 3 boys. So if there are 3 parts boys equal to 100, each part is 100/3 \u224833.333. So girls would be 2 parts, which is 66.666. But again, that's not an option.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck here. The only way I can see the options making sense is if I made a mistake in the initial setup. But I can't see where I went wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the number of girls is 2/5 of the boys. So girls = (2/5)*100 =40. But again, 40 isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the girls are 2/5 of the total, and the boys are 100. So girls are 2/5 T, boys are 3/5 T. 3/5 T=100 \u2192 T=500/3. So girls=2/5 *500/3=200/3\u224866.666. Again, same result.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer isn't listed, but perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended the fraction to be 3/5 for girls, making the girls 100, but that's option B.\n\nWait, if the fraction were 3/5 for girls, then girls would be 3/5 T, and boys 2/5 T. So 2/5 T=100 \u2192 T=250. Girls would be 3/5 *250=150, which is option C. But the problem states girls are 2/5, not 3/5.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-read the problem. It says exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls. So the correct setup is 2/5 girls, 3/5 boys. Boys are 100. So 3/5 T=100 \u2192 T=500/3\u2248166.666. Girls are 2/5 T\u224866.666. But since that's not an option, perhaps the problem is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the fraction is 3/5 for girls, leading to 150 girls. So the answer would be C)150. But that's not what the problem states.\n\nHmm, I'm really stuck here. Based on the problem as stated, the correct answer isn't among the options. But since this is a multiple-choice question, perhaps the intended answer is option C)150. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is in the ratio. So girls are 2 parts, boys 3 parts. So total parts=5. Each part is 100/3\u224833.333. So girls are 2*33.333\u224866.666. But that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem intended the fraction to be 2/5 for the boys. Let me test that. If boys are 2/5, then girls are 3/5. Boys=100=2/5 T \u2192 T=250. Girls=3/5*250=150, which is option C. So perhaps the problem had a typo, and the fraction for boys is 2/5, making girls 3/5. But the problem says girls are 2/5. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm. I think I've tried everything. I'll have to go with the answer that the number of girls is approximately 66.666, but since that's not an option, perhaps the problem is intended to have option C)150 as the answer. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E)70, but I can't see how.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's calculate the total number of students as T. Girls are 2T/5, boys are 3T/5=100. So T=500/3\u2248166.666. Girls=2/5 *500/3=200/3\u224866.666. So the number of girls is 66.666, which is approximately 67. But that's not an option.\n\nI think I've reached the limit of my understanding. Based on the problem as stated, the correct answer is not among the options provided. However, perhaps the intended answer is option E)70. But I can't see how that would work.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the fraction is of the boys. Let me try that. If girls are 2/5 of the boys, then girls= (2/5)*100=40. But that's not an option. So no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the fraction is of the total, but the class includes other children besides boys and girls. For example, if there are other children, then the fraction of girls is 2/5 of the total. Let me assume that. Let T be the total. Girls = 2T/5. Boys=100. So 2T/5 + 100 = T \u2192 100 = T - 2T/5 \u2192 100=3T/5 \u2192 T=500/3\u2248166.666. Girls=2*(500/3)/5=200/3\u224866.666. Same result. So the number of girls is 66.666, which isn't an option.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer isn't listed, but perhaps the intended answer is option C)150, assuming the fraction was meant to be 3/5 for girls. But I can't be certain.\n\nAfter all this, I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is not among the options, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C)150. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the 2/5 refers to the girls, so the boys are 3/5. So 3/5 of the class is 100. So the total class is (100) / (3/5) = 166.666. Girls are 2/5 of that, which is 66.666. So the answer is approximately 66.666, which isn't an option. So the correct answer isn't provided.\n\n\nThe problem states that exactly 2/5 of the children in a class are girls, and there are 100 boys in the class. To find the number of girls, we start by noting that if 2/5 of the class are girls, then 3/5 of the class are boys. Let the total number of children be \\( T \\). Since 3/5 of \\( T \\) equals 100 (the number of boys), we can write:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{5}T = 100\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( T \\), we multiply both sides by \\( \\frac{5}{3} \\):\n\n\\[\nT = 100 \\times \\frac{5}{3} = \\frac{500}{3} \\approx 166.666\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of girls, which is 2/5 of the total number of children:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of girls} = \\frac{2}{5}T = \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{500}{3} = \\frac{200}{3} \\approx 66.666\n\\]\n\nThis result indicates that the number of girls is approximately 66.666, which is not a whole number and does not match any of the provided options: A) 50, B) 100, C) 150, D) 200, E) 70.\n\nTo verify further, we consider the ratio of girls to boys. Since girls are 2/5 of the class and boys are 3/5, the ratio of girls to boys is 2:3. If there are 100 boys, each \"part\" in the ratio corresponds to \\( \\frac{100}{3} \\approx 33.333 \\). Therefore, the number of girls would be \\( 2 \\times 33.333 \\approx 66.666 \\), which again does not match any of the options.\n\nRechecking the options:\n- If the number of girls were 50 (option A), the total number of children would be \\( T = \\frac{50 \\times 5}{2} = 125 \\), and the number of boys would be \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\times 125 = 75 \\), which contradicts the given 100 boys.\n- If the number of girls were 100 (option B), the total number of children would be \\( T = \\frac{100 \\times 5}{2} = 250 \\), and the number of boys would be \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\times 250 = 150 \\), which again contradicts the given 100 boys.\n- If the number of girls were 150 (option C), the total number of children would be \\( T = \\frac{150 \\times 5}{2} = 375 \\), and the number of boys would be \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\times 375 = 225 \\), which contradicts the given 100 boys.\n- If the number of girls were 200 (option D), the total number of children would be \\( T = \\frac{200 \\times 5}{2} = 500 \\), and the number of boys would be \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\times 500 = 300 \\), which contradicts the given 100 boys.\n- If the number of girls were 70 (option E), the total number of children would be \\( T = \\frac{70 \\times 5}{2} = 175 \\), and the number of boys would be \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\times 175 = 105 \\), which also contradicts the given 100 boys.\n\nNone of the options align with the calculated result of approximately 66.666 girls. Therefore, the correct answer is not listed among the options provided.\n\nANSWER: None of the options are correct.",
