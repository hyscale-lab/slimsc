The total distance between A and B is denoted as \\( D \\). The key information is that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, Kevin was 70 miles away from B while approaching it.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Total Trip Time**:  \n   The total time for the trip is the sum of the time taken to travel from A to B (\\( T_1 = \\frac{D}{70} \\)) and the time taken to return from B to A (\\( T_2 = \\frac{D}{90} \\)). Thus, the total time is:  \n   \\[\n   T = T_1 + T_2 = \\frac{D}{70} + \\frac{D}{90}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Time 3 Hours Before the End**:  \n   At \\( T - 3 \\) hours into the trip, Kevin was 70 miles away from B while approaching it. This means he was still on his way to B, having not yet reached it. The distance he had covered by this point is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance covered} = 70 \\times (T - 3).\n   \\]  \n   Since he was 70 miles away from B, the remaining distance to B is:  \n   \\[\n   D - 70 = 70 \\times (T - 3).\n   \\]  \n   Rearranging, we find:  \n   \\[\n   D = 70 \\times (T - 3) + 70.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Substitute Total Time \\( T \\)**:  \n   Substituting \\( T = \\frac{D}{70} + \\frac{D}{90} \\) into the equation for \\( D \\):  \n   \\[\n   D = 70 \\left( \\frac{D}{70} + \\frac{D}{90} - 3 \\right) + 70.\n   \\]  \n   Simplify the terms inside the parentheses:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{D}{70} + \\frac{D}{90} = D \\left( \\frac{1}{70} + \\frac{1}{90} \\right) = D \\left( \\frac{90 + 70}{6300} \\right) = D \\left( \\frac{160}{6300} \\right) = D \\left( \\frac{8}{315} \\right).\n   \\]  \n   Thus:  \n   \\[\n   D = 70 \\left( \\frac{8D}{315} - 3 \\right) + 70.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the Equation**:  \n   Expand and simplify:  \n   \\[\n   D = \\frac{560D}{315} - 210 + 70.\n   \\]  \n   \\[\n   D = \\frac{560D}{315} - 140.\n   \\]  \n   Multiply through by 315 to eliminate the denominator:  \n   \\[\n   315D = 560D - 44100.\n   \\]  \n   Rearrange:  \n   \\[\n   315D - 560D = -44100.\n   \\]  \n   \\[\n   -245D = -44100.\n   \\]  \n   Solve for \\( D \\):  \n   \\[\n   D = \\frac{44100}{245} = 180.\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe distance between A and B is \\( D = 180 \\) miles. This matches option **A**. \n\n**Answer: A**"
