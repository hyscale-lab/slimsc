The setup is as follows:\n\n```\n   M A D\n\u00d7   B E\n------------\n   M A D\nR A E\n------------\nA M I D\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **E must be 1**: Since MAD \u00d7 E = MAD, E must be 1 because any number multiplied by 1 remains unchanged.\n2. **A = 0**: From the addition in the hundreds place, M + A = M implies A = 0.\n3. **I = 1**: From the addition in the tens place, A + E = I, and since A = 0 and E = 1, I = 1.\n4. **Conflict in options**: All options except E have I = 1, which conflicts with E = 1. Option E has I = 2, which avoids the conflict but introduces another issue: D = 2 and A = 2, which violates the uniqueness of digits.\n\n### Testing the Options:\n- **Option A (9 2 0 0)**: I and D both = 0, which is invalid.\n- **Option B (9 2 0 9)**: I = 9 and E = 1, which avoids the conflict. MAD = 920, BE = B1, and AMID = 2990. Testing shows 920 \u00d7 31 = 28520, which is inconsistent.\n- **Option C (9 2 0 1)**: I = 1, which conflicts with E = 1.\n- **Option D (9 2 0 7)**: I = 7, which avoids the conflict. MAD = 920, BE = B1, and AMID = 2970. Testing shows 920 \u00d7 3.228 \u2248 2970, which is invalid since B1 must be an integer.\n- **Option E (9 2 2 2)**: D = 2 and A = 2, which violates the uniqueness of digits.\n\n### Conclusion:\nOption B is the most plausible choice despite the conflict in the multiplication table setup. It avoids the direct conflict between I and E and aligns with the given options.\n\nANSWER: B"
