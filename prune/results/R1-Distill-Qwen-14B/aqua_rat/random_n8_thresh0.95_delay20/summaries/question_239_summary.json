To find the number of girls, we set up the equation:\n\n(3/5) * T = 100  \nT = 100 * (5/3) \u2248 166.666  \n\nSince the number of children must be a whole number, we proceed with the fractional total to find the number of girls:\n\nNumber of girls = (2/5) * (500/3) \u2248 66.666  \n\nHowever, this result isn't an option. Considering the provided options and the ratio of girls to boys being 2:3, the closest plausible answer is 150 girls, even though it doesn't fully align with the problem's conditions.\n\n**Answer: C**"
