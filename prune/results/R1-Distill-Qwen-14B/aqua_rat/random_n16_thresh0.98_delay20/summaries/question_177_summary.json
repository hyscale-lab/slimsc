The setup is as follows:\n\n```\n   M A D\n\u00d7   B E\n------------\n   M A D   (MAD \u00d7 E)\nR A E       (MAD \u00d7 B, shifted left by one)\n------------\nA M I D\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **First Partial Product (MAD \u00d7 E):**  \n   Since the first partial product is MAD itself, it implies that `E = 1`. This is because any number multiplied by 1 remains unchanged.\n\n2. **Second Partial Product (MAD \u00d7 B):**  \n   The second partial product is RAE, which is the result of multiplying MAD by B. Since BE is a two-digit number, the second partial product is effectively `MAD \u00d7 B \u00d7 10`.\n\n3. **Total Sum:**  \n   Adding the two partial products (MAD and RAE \u00d7 10) gives the four-digit result AMID. This can be expressed as:  \n   \\[\n   (100M + 10A + D) + (100R + 10A + 1) \\times 10 = 1000A + 100M + 10I + D\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplification:**  \n   Simplifying the equation leads to:  \n   \\[\n   100R + 1 = 89A + I\n   \\]  \n   where \\(I\\) is a single digit (0-9).\n\n5. **Testing Possible Values:**  \n   - From the equation \\(100R + 1 = 89A + I\\), \\(A\\) must be such that \\(89A\\) is close to \\(100R + 1\\).  \n   - Testing \\(A = 9\\):  \n     \\[\n     100R + 1 = 89 \\times 9 + I \\implies 100R + 1 = 801 + I\n     \\]  \n     For \\(I\\) to be a single digit, \\(100R = 800 \\implies R = 8\\). Thus, \\(I = 0\\).\n\n6. **Verification:**  \n   - With \\(A = 9\\), \\(R = 8\\), and \\(I = 0\\), the four-digit result is \\(AMID = 9207\\).  \n   - Checking the multiplication:  \n     \\[\n     MAD = 297, \\quad BE = 31\n     \\]  \n     \\[\n     297 \\times 31 = 9207\n     \\]  \n     This matches the four-digit result \\(AMID = 9207\\).\n\n7. **Mapping Digits:**  \n   - \\(A = 9\\), \\(M = 2\\), \\(D = 7\\), \\(B = 3\\), \\(E = 1\\), \\(R = 8\\), \\(I = 0\\).  \n   - All digits are unique and satisfy the conditions of the problem.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct answer is **9 2 0 7**, which corresponds to option **D**.\n\nANSWER: D"
