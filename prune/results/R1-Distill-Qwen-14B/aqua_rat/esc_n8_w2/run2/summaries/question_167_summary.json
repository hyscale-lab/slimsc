      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about two printers working together. Let me see if I can figure this out. The question says Printer A and Printer B can each print 1/2 a page per second. Hmm, right, so each of them is kinda slow, only half a page every second.\n\nWait, I remember when you have two things working together, their rates add up. Like, if two people are painting a house, you add their rates. So maybe I should add the printing rates of both printers here.\n\nSo Printer A does 1/2 page per second. Printer B also does 1/2 page per second. Together, their combined rate should be 1/2 + 1/2 = 1 page per second. Oh, that's nice, because then together they can print a whole page every second.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking how long it takes to print 100 pages. So if they're doing 1 page per second together, then for 100 pages, it should take 100 seconds. Because 100 pages divided by 1 page per second equals 100 seconds.\n\nLet me double-check. If each does half a page in a second, then in one second, together they make 1 page. So yeah, 100 pages would take 100 seconds. Looking at the options, option C is 100 seconds. So that must be the answer.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. Sometimes when I see these problems, I get mixed up about adding rates or not. Let me think again. Each printer's rate is 0.5 pages per second. So together, it's 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 page per second. Right, that's correct. So time is total work divided by rate. Total work is 100 pages. So time = 100 / 1 = 100 seconds. Yep, that's right.\n",

Wait, that seems a bit confusing because 1/2 page per second is like half a page every second. So each printer is pretty slow, right?\n\nLet me break it down. If one printer can do 0.5 pages per second, then two printers together would be 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 page per second. Oh, wait, that makes sense because together they're twice as fast. So their combined rate is 1 page per second.\n\nNow, the question is asking how long it takes to print 100 pages at this combined rate. So time equals the number of pages divided by the rate.
