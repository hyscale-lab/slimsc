      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Ram and Krishna starting from points A and B, respectively. They're moving towards each other, right? Ram's speed is 20 meters per second, and Krishna's is 40 m/s. They meet after 10 seconds, and I need to find the total distance between A and B.\n\nHmm, let's see. Both start at the same time and move towards each other. So, they meet after 10 seconds. That means each has been traveling for 10 seconds when they meet at point C.\n\nWait, so the distance each covers until meeting would be their speed multiplied by time. So Ram covers 20 m/s * 10 s = 200 meters. And Krishna covers 40 m/s * 10 s = 400 meters.\n\nOh, right, because they started from opposite ends and met, the total distance between A and B must be the sum of the distances they each covered before meeting. So that's 200 + 400 = 600 meters.\n\nLet me check the options. Option E is 600 meters, so that should be the answer.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't mix anything up. The speeds are 20 and 40, so in 10 seconds, yes, 20*10=200, 40*10=400. 200+400=600. Yeah, that makes sense. So the total distance between A and B is 600 meters. So the correct option is E.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about Ram and Krishna starting from points A and B, moving towards each other. Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nRam starts from A, and Krishna from B. They both leave at the same time and travel towards each other on the same route. Ram's speed is 20 m/s, and Krishna's is 40 m/s. They meet at point C after 10 seconds. I need to find the total distance between A and B.\n\nHmm, right. So, when two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. That's because they're approaching each other, so their speeds add up. So in this case, Ram's speed is 20 m/s and Krishna's is 40 m/s. So the combined speed is 20 + 40 = 60 m/s.\n\nWait, but what's the total distance? Oh, right. The time taken until they meet is 10 seconds. So the distance between A and B should be the distance each covers in 10 seconds, added together.\n\nAlternatively, since they're moving towards each other, the combined distance they cover in that time is equal to the total distance between A and B. So, I can calculate the distance each covers and sum them.\n\nLet me think. The formula for distance is speed multiplied by time. So for Ram, distance = 20 m/s * 10 s = 200 meters. For Krishna, it's 40 m/s * 10 s = 400 meters. So adding those together, 200 + 400 = 600 meters. So the total distance between A and B is 600 meters.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 600 meters. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but I should double-check my approach. Another way to look at it is using the concept that when two objects move towards each other, the time taken to meet is the initial distance divided by the sum of their speeds.\n\nSo, time = distance / (v1 + v2). Rearranging, distance = (v1 + v2) * time.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: (20 + 40) m/s * 10 s = 60 * 10 = 600 meters. Yep, same result.\n\nSo the correct answer is E) 600 meters.\n",
