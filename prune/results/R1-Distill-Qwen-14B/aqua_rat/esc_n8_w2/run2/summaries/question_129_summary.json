      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where the difference between the squares of two numbers is 256,000, and their sum is 1000. I need to find which pair of numbers fits this. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nHmm, I remember that there's a formula for the difference of squares. Oh right, a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 equals (a - b)(a + b). Oh wait, that's perfect because I have both the difference of squares and the sum.\n\nSo the problem gives me that a + b = 1000, and a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 256,000. Using the formula, I can write a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 as (a - b)(a + b). Substituting the known sum, that becomes (a - b) * 1000 = 256,000. \n\nSo, (a - b) = 256,000 / 1000. Let me calculate that. 256,000 divided by 1000 is 256. So a - b = 256.\n\nNow I have two equations:\n1. a + b = 1000\n2. a - b = 256\n\nI can solve these two equations simultaneously. Let me add both equations together. \n\nAdding equation 1 and 2:\n(a + b) + (a - b) = 1000 + 256\nThat simplifies to 2a = 1256\nSo a = 1256 / 2 = 628.\n\nWait, so a is 628. Then I can find b by plugging a back into one of the equations. Let's use equation 1: a + b = 1000.\n\nSo 628 + b = 1000 \u2192 b = 1000 - 628 = 372.\n\nSo the two numbers are 628 and 372. Let me check the options. Option B is 628 and 372, so that's the pair. \n\nWait, but let me double-check just to be sure. Let me compute the squares.\n\n628 squared: Let's see, 600\u00b2 is 360,000. 28\u00b2 is 784. Then, 628\u00b2 is (600 + 28)^2 = 600\u00b2 + 2*600*28 + 28\u00b2 = 360,000 + 33,600 + 784 = 360,000 + 33,600 is 393,600, plus 784 is 394,384.\n\n372 squared: 370\u00b2 is 136,900. 2\u00b2 is 4. So (370 + 2)^2 = 370\u00b2 + 2*370*2 + 2\u00b2 = 136,900 + 1,480 +4 = 138,384.\n\nNow, subtracting 372\u00b2 from 628\u00b2: 394,384 - 138,384 = 256,000. Yep, that matches the given difference. And their sum is 628 + 372 = 1000, which also matches. So that's correct.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 628 and 372, so that's the answer. Wait, but let me check the other options to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nOption C is 640 and 360. Their sum is 1000. Let me compute the difference of their squares. 640\u00b2 is 409,600. 360\u00b2 is 129,600. So difference is 409,600 - 129,600 = 280,000. Which is larger than 256,000. So not correct.\n\nOption A is 600 and 400. Sum is 1000. Their squares: 600\u00b2=360,000; 400\u00b2=160,000. Difference is 200,000. Not 256k. So nope.\n\nSo yeah, option B is correct. So the answer should be B.\n",

The question says that the difference between the squares of two numbers is 256,000 and their sum is 1000. I need to find which pair of numbers from the options fits these conditions.\n\nHmm, I remember that when dealing with squares and sums, there's a useful algebraic identity. Oh right! The difference of squares formula. So, if I have two numbers, let's call them x and y, then the difference between their squares is (x\u00b2 - y\u00b2). And I know that this can be factored into (x + y)(x - y). \n\nThe problem gives me that x + y = 1000, and x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 256,000. So substituting the difference of squares, I get (x + y)(x - y) = 256,000. Since I know x + y is 1000, I can plug that in: 1000 * (x - y) = 256,000. \n\nNow, to find (x - y), I can divide both sides by 1000. So, 256,000 divided by 1000 is 256.

Adding the left sides: (x + y) + (x - y) = 2x. And the right sides: 1000 + 256 = 1256. So 2x = 1256, which means x is 1256 / 2 = 628. \n\nOnce I have x, I can find y by subtracting (x - y) from (x + y). Wait, no, maybe I should use one of the initial equations. Let's use x + y = 1000.

Let's compute 640\u00b2 - 360\u00b2. Using the same identity: (640 + 360)(640 - 360) = 1000 * 280 = 280,000. But the problem says it should be 256,000, so option C doesn't work. \n\nSimilarly, option A: 600 and 400. Sum is 1000. Their difference is 200. So (600+400)(600-400) = 1000*200=200,000. Not 256,000.
