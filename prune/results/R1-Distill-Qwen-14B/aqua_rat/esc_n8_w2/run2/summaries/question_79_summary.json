      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about the average weight of some vehicles. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that the average weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. Then, when a new heavy duty truck is added, the average increases by 2.6 tons. I need to find the weight of that truck.\n\nWait, so initially, there are 10 vehicles with an average of 12.2. That means the total weight is 10 multiplied by 12.2. Let me calculate that. 10 * 12.2 is 122 tons. Got that.\n\nNow, when a new truck is added, the number of vehicles becomes 11. And the average increases by 2.6 tons. So the new average is 12.2 + 2.6. Let me add those numbers. 12.2 plus 2.6 is 14.8 tons. So the new average is 14.8 tons for 11 vehicles.\n\nTo find the total weight after adding the truck, I multiply 14.8 by 11. Let me do that. 14.8 times 11... Hmm, 14.8 *10 is 148, plus another 14.8 gives 162.8 tons. So the new total weight is 162.8 tons.\n\nWait, but the original total was 122 tons. So the truck must account for the difference between the new total and the old total. So I subtract 122 from 162.8. 162.8 minus 122 is 40.8 tons. So the truck is 40.8 tons heavy.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 40.8. So that must be the answer. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nOriginal average:12.2, 10 vehicles: 122 total. New average:14.8, 11 vehicles:14.8*11=162.8. 162.8-122=40.8. Yep, that seems right.\n",

Hmm, the problem says that the average weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. Then, when a new heavy duty truck is added, the average increases by 2.6 tons. I need to find the weight of that truck.\n\nWait, averages. Right, the average is the total divided by the number of items. So initially, there are 10 vehicles averaging 12.2 tons. That means the total weight is 10 multiplied by 12.2. Let me calculate that. 10 times 12.2 is 122 tons. Got that down.\n\nNow, when they add another vehicle, the number of vehicles becomes 11. The average increases by 2.6 tons, so the new average is 12.2 plus 2.6. Let me do that addition. 12.2 plus 2.6 is... 14.8 tons. So the new average is 14.8.\n\nThe total weight for 11 vehicles at this new average would be 11 multiplied by 14.8. Let me compute that. 11 times 14 is 154, and 11 times 0.8 is 8.8, so adding those together, 154 + 8.8 equals 162.8 tons. So the total weight after adding the truck is 162.8 tons.\n\nWait, the original total was 122 tons. So the truck must weigh the difference between the new total and the original total. That would be 162.8 minus 122. Let me subtract that: 162.8 - 122 is 40.8 tons. So the truck is 40.8 tons heavy.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 40.8. So that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Oh, wait, 11 *14.8: 10*14.8 is 148, plus 14.8 is 162.8. Yeah, correct. And 162.8 - 122 is indeed 40.8.
