      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. So, the question is about calculating the percentage gain of a merchant who bought oranges and sold them. Hmm, percentage gain, that's like profit percentage, right? I remember that profit percentage is calculated based on the cost price. \n\nAlright, let's see the details. The merchant bought 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450. So wait, the total cost is 450 rupees for 90 kg. I think the first thing I should do is figure out the cost per kilogram. Because when he sells, he sells per kg, so maybe that's useful.\n\nSo, cost per kg would be total cost divided by total kg. So 450 divided by 90. Let me calculate that. 450 divided by 90 is 5. Oh right, so he bought each kg for 5 rupees. \n\nThen he sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg. Oh wait, the whole lot is 90 kg. So the selling price would be the rate per kg multiplied by the total kg. So 7.50 times 90. Let me compute that. 7.5 times 90... Well, 7 times 90 is 630, and 0.5 times 90 is 45, so 630+45=675. So he sold it for 675 rupees.\n\nNow, to find the gain percentage. Gain, or profit, is selling price minus cost price. So 675 minus 450 equals 225. So the profit is 225 rupees.\n\nBut percentage gain is calculated based on the cost price, right? So the formula is (Profit / Cost Price) * 100. So that would be (225 / 450) * 100. Let me compute that. 225 divided by 450 is 0.5, and 0.5 times 100 is 50%. So the percentage gain is 50%. \n\nWait a second, but looking at the options, option A is 50%, so that's one of the choices. So the answer should be option A.\n\nWait, did I do that right? Let me double-check. He bought 90 kg for 450, which is 5 per kg. Sold at 7.5, so per kg profit is 2.5. So per kg, he makes 2.5. For 90 kg, that's 2.5 *90=225. So profit is 225. Cost is 450. 225/450 is indeed 0.5, so 50%. Yep, that seems correct.\n",

Hmm, let me think through it step by step.\n\nAlright, the merchant bought 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450. So first, I should figure out the cost price per kilogram. Wait, right, because he bought all 90 kg for 450, so per kg would be 450 divided by 90. Let me calculate that. 450 divided by 90 is 5. So each kg cost him Rs.5.\n\nThen, he sold the whole lot at Rs.7.50 per kg. Oh, okay, so he sold each kg for 7.50. So I need to find out how much he sold the entire 90 kg for. That would be 90 multiplied by 7.50. Let me compute that. 90 times 7 is 630, and 90 times 0.5 is 45. So adding those together, 630 + 45 is 675. So he sold it for Rs.675.\n\nWait, so his cost price was Rs.450 and selling price is Rs.675. To find the gain percentage, I think I need to calculate the profit first. Profit is selling price minus cost price. So 675 minus 450 equals 225. So he made a profit of 225 rupees.\n\nNow, percentage gain, I believe, is calculated as (Profit / Cost Price) * 100. So that would be (225 / 450) * 100. Let me do that division. 225 divided by 450 is 0.5. Multiply by 100 gives 50%.
