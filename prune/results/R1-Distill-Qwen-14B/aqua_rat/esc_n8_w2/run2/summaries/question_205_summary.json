      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a liquid passing through a drain. Hmm, let's try to figure it out. The question is asking how many minutes it takes for y gallons to pass through, given the rate is w/25 gallons every x seconds. \n\nWait, let's break this down. The rate is w/25 gallons per x seconds. So I think I need to find the time in minutes when y gallons have passed. \n\nFirst, maybe I should find the rate in gallons per second. Because right now, it's gallons per x seconds. So, the rate R would be (w/25) gallons divided by x seconds. So R = (w)/(25x) gallons per second.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for time in minutes, right? So I'll need to convert seconds to minutes eventually. Oh right, because the answer needs to be in minutes.\n\nSo, if the rate is in gallons per second, I can find the time in seconds by dividing the total gallons by the rate. Then convert that time to minutes.\n\nWait, let's think. Time is equal to amount divided by rate. So time in seconds would be y / R. And since R is (w)/(25x), then time in seconds is y divided by (w/(25x)).\n\nLet me write that out: Time_seconds = y / (w/(25x)) ) = y * (25x / w) ) = (25xy)/w seconds.\n\nBut the question wants the time in minutes. So I need to convert seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute. So I divide the time in seconds by 60.\n\nSo Time_minutes = (25xy)/(w * 60) ) = (25xy)/(60w). Let me simplify that. 25 and 60 can both be divided by 5. 25/5 is 5, 60/5 is 12. So that becomes (5xy)/(12w). \n\nHmm, looking at the options, option C is 5xy/(12w). So that should be the correct answer. Let me double-check my steps.\n\nWait, wait. Let me go through again. Rate is w/25 gallons every x seconds. So the rate is (w/25)/x = w/(25x) per second. To find time, time = amount / rate. So y / (w/(25x)) ) = y * (25x/w) seconds. Which is 25xy/w seconds. To get minutes, divide by 60: (25xy)/(60w) = (5xy)/(12w). Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be option C.\n",

Let me break this down. \n\nFirst, the rate is given as w/25 gallons per x seconds. So the rate (let's call it R) is (w/25) gallons over x seconds. That makes R = (w/25)/x. Wait, no, wait. Because rate is usually quantity over time. So if it's w/25 gallons every x seconds, that would be R = (w/25) / x gallons per second. So yeah, R = w/(25x) gallons per second.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should think of it as gallons per second. So, the rate is (w/25) divided by x, which is w/(25x) gallons per second. \n\nNow, I need to find the time it takes for y gallons to pass. Time is equal to quantity divided by rate. So time in seconds would be y divided by R. That would be t = y / (w/(25x)). Hmm, dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So that becomes y * (25x/w). So t = (25x y)/w seconds.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the time in minutes. Oh right, because the options are in minutes. So I need to convert seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so I divide by 60. So t_minutes = (25xy/w) / 60. Simplify that: 25xy/(60w). \n\nWait, 25 divided by 60 can be simplified. Both are divisible by 5. 25 \u00f75 is 5, 60 \u00f75 is 12. So that's 5xy/(12w) minutes. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 5xy/(12w). So that must be the correct answer. \n\nLet me double-check. So the steps are: find the rate in gallons per second, compute time in seconds, convert to minutes. Yeah, that makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach it using dimensional analysis. Let's see. \n\nWe have y gallons. We need to find time. The rate is (w/25) gallons per x seconds. So the rate is (w/25) gal/(x sec). So time is y / rate. \n\nTime in seconds: y / (w/(25x)) ) = (y * 25x) / w seconds. Then convert to minutes by dividing by 60: (25x y)/(60w) = 5xy/(12w).
