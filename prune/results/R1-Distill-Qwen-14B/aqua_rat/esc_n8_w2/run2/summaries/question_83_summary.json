      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm a bit new to these kinds of questions, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about.\n\nThe question says that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11. Oh right, GCF is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. So both numbers are multiples of 11.\n\nThen it says the least common multiple (LCM) of these two integers is 7700. LCM is the smallest number that both numbers divide into. So, both numbers must be factors of 7700.\n\nOne of the integers is 350, and I need to find the other. The options are given as A to E.\n\nHmm, I remember there's a relationship between GCF and LCM of two numbers. Oh right, the product of the two numbers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM. So, if the numbers are a and b, then a * b = GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b).\n\nSo, using that formula, I can plug in the known values. Let me write that down.\n\nGiven:\nGCF(a, b) = 11\nLCM(a, b) = 7700\na = 350\nWe need to find b.\n\nSo, according to the formula: a * b = GCF * LCM\nSo, 350 * b = 11 * 7700\n\nLet me compute 11 multiplied by 7700. Wait, 7700 divided by 11 is 700, because 11*700 is 7700. Wait, no, wait. 11 * 700 is 7700, right? Because 700*10 is 7000, plus 700 is 7700. So 11 *7700 is 11 * (700 *11), which is 700 * 121. Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me just calculate 11 * 7700.\n\n11 times 7700. 7700 times 10 is 77,000, plus another 7700 is 84,700. So 11*7700 is 84,700.\n\nSo the equation is 350 * b = 84,700.\n\nTo find b, I can divide 84,700 by 350.\n\nHmm, let me calculate that. 350 goes into 84,700 how many times?\n\nFirst, let's see 350 times 200 is 70,000. Subtract that from 84,700, which leaves 14,700.\n\n350 times 40 is 14,000. So 200 +40 =240, and 350*240 = 84,000. Then, 14,700 -14,000 is 700. 350 goes into 700 exactly 2 times. So 240 +2=242.\n\nSo, 350 *242 =84,700. So b must be 242. Looking at the options, option A is 242. So that's the answer. But wait, let me make sure.\n\nWait, but I should also check if 242 and 350 have a GCF of 11. Because sometimes, the formula gives a number, but maybe there's a mistake in the approach.\n\nSo, let me find the GCF of 350 and 242.\n\nFirst, factor both numbers.\n\n350: Let's see, 350 divided by 2 is 175. 175 is 5*35, which is 5*5*7. So 350 is 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242: Let's see, 242 divided by 2 is 121. 121 is 11 squared. So 242 is 2 *11^2.\n\nSo, the common factors: both have a 2. But wait, the GCF is given as 11. Hmm, that's a problem. Because according to this, the GCF would be 2, not 11.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake in my calculation?\n\nWait, no. Because 350 is 2 *5^2 *7 and 242 is 2 *11^2. So the common factors are just 2. But the GCF is supposed to be 11. That's a contradiction.\n\nSo, my earlier approach must be wrong. Or maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me check the formula again. Oh wait, I think I might have confused the formula. The product of the numbers is equal to GCF multiplied by LCM. So, 350 * b = 11 *7700.\n\nWait, 11 *7700 is 84,700. 350 times 242 is 84,700, correct. But their GCF is 2, not 11. So that can't be.\n\nHmm, so that means I must have made a mistake in my initial approach. Maybe the formula applies only when the numbers are co-prime? No, I don't think so. The formula should hold regardless.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the GCF. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, 350 and 242. Let me find the GCF using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nSo, GCF(350,242). \n\nStep 1: 350 divided by 242 is 1 with a remainder of 108 (because 242 *1 =242; 350-242=108).\n\nStep 2: Now find GCF(242,108).\n\n242 divided by 108 is 2 (108*2=216), remainder is 26 (242-216=26).\n\nStep3: GCF(108,26).\n\n108 \u00f726 =4, 26*4=104. Remainder 4.\n\nStep4: GCF(26,4).\n\n26 \u00f74=6, 4*6=24. Remainder 2.\n\nStep5: GCF(4,2).\n\n4 \u00f72=2, remainder 0. So GCF is 2.\n\nSo yes, the GCF is 2, not 11. But the question says the GCF is 11. So that's a problem. Which means that 242 can't be the correct answer. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, so what's wrong here? Did I miscalculate the product? Let me check the product again.\n\n350 *242: 350 *200 =70,000; 350 *40=14,000; 350 *2=700. So 70,000 +14,000=84,000; plus 700 is 84,700. Correct.\n\nAnd 11 *7700=84,700. So the product is correct, but the GCF is 2, not 11. So that's a problem.\n\nHmm, so maybe the initial assumption that the other number is 242 is wrong because it doesn't satisfy the GCF condition. So what did I do wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is correct, but in this case, the other number must be such that both numbers have 11 as a GCF. So, perhaps I should factor 350 and see if it's a multiple of 11.\n\nWait, 350 divided by 11: 11*31 is 341, 350-341=9. So 350 is not divisible by 11. So how can the GCF be 11? Because if one number is 350, which isn't a multiple of 11, and the other is a multiple of 11, the GCF would be 11 only if 350 is also a multiple of 11. Wait, that's not possible. So is the question wrong?\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me double-check: 350 is 35 *10. 35 is 5*7, 10 is 2*5. So 350 is 2*5^2*7. So it's not divisible by 11. So how can the GCF be 11? Because GCF is the product of the minimum exponents of shared prime factors. So if one number is 350 (which doesn't have 11 as a factor), and the other has 11 as a factor, then the GCF can't be 11. Because 350 doesn't have 11 as a factor, so the GCF can't include 11.\n\nWait, so that means there's a mistake in the problem statement? Or perhaps I misunderstood the question.\n\nWait, the problem says the GCF is 11. So both numbers must be multiples of 11. Because GCF is 11, which is a prime. So both numbers must have 11 as a factor.\n\nBut 350 isn't a multiple of 11. 350 /11 is approximately 31.818..., which isn't an integer. So this is impossible. So perhaps the question is incorrect. But the options are given, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. The formula says a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So, if GCF is 11, and a is 350, which is not a multiple of 11, that can't be. So maybe the initial premise is impossible. But the question is given, so perhaps I've made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. Maybe I can express 350 as a multiple of 11. Let me see. 350 divided by 11 is approximately 31.818. So it's not a multiple. So how can the GCF be 11?\n\nWait, this suggests that the problem has no solution. But the options are given, so perhaps I've made a mistake in my approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is correct, and I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should proceed differently. Let me think about the properties of GCF and LCM.\n\nIf the GCF of two numbers is 11, then both numbers can be expressed as 11 multiplied by two coprime integers. Because GCF is 11, so when you divide each number by 11, the resulting numbers are coprime (their GCF is 1).\n\nSo let me write the two numbers as:\n\na = 11 * m\n\nb = 11 * n\n\nWhere m and n are coprime integers (their GCF is 1).\n\nThen, the LCM of a and b would be 11 * m * n, because LCM(a,b) = (a*b)/GCF(a,b) = (11m *11n)/11 = 11 m n.\n\nSo, given that LCM(a, b) is 7700, which is 7700 =11 * m *n.\n\nSo, m * n = 7700 /11 = 700.\n\nSo, m * n =700.\n\nAlso, since a is 350, which is 11 * m. So, 350 =11 * m \u2192 m=350/11.\n\nWait, 350 divided by 11 is approximately 31.818, which isn't an integer. So m isn't an integer. That can't be right. Because m must be an integer since a is 11*m.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the problem is impossible because 350 isn't a multiple of 11. But the problem states that one of the numbers is 350. So perhaps I've made a mistake in understanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating something. Let me recheck 350 \u00f711.\n\n11 * 31 = 341. 350-341=9. So 350=11*31 +9. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. So this can't be possible. So the problem as stated is impossible, because the GCF can't be 11 if one number isn't a multiple of 11.\n\nBut the options are given, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the question had a typo, but assuming the question is correct, maybe I should proceed differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me try another way.\n\nSo, the formula says a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So, 350 * b =11 *7700.\n\nWhich gives b= (11*7700)/350.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nCompute 11 *7700 = 84,700.\n\nThen 84,700 \u00f7350.\n\nWell, 350 times 242 is 84,700. So that's correct. But as earlier, 350 and 242 have a GCF of 2, not 11. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, the product is correct. But the GCF is not matching. So perhaps the problem is wrong, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the options to see if any of them, when multiplied by 350, give 84,700 and have a GCF of 11 with 350.\n\nWait, but 350 is not a multiple of 11, so any other number that is a multiple of 11 when multiplied by 350 would have a product of 11*(something), but 350 doesn't have 11 as a factor, so the GCF of 350 and any multiple of 11 would be 1, not 11.\n\nWait, but that's conflicting with the problem statement. So I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem intended that the GCF is 11, but one of the numbers isn't 350. Or perhaps I'm misapplying the formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach should be to find the other number such that the GCF is 11 and the LCM is 7700, given that one number is 350.\n\nWait, perhaps I should find the other number b such that GCF(350, b)=11 and LCM(350, b)=7700.\n\nSo, using the formula:\n\n350 * b = 11 *7700 \u2192 350*b=84700 \u2192 b=84700/350=242.\n\nBut as before, 350 and 242 have a GCF of 2, not 11. So that's a problem. So perhaps the problem has an error.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the other number is 242, but the GCF is 2, which contradicts the problem statement. So perhaps the question is wrong. But the options are given, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me try to find the other number such that GCF is 11.\n\nSo, let me factor 350. 350=2*5^2*7.\n\nThe other number, let's call it b, must have 11 as a factor, but no higher common factors with 350 beyond 11. Because GCF is 11.\n\nSo, the prime factors of b must include 11, and any other factors must not be present in 350 beyond what's in 11.\n\nSo, 350's factors are 2,5,7.\n\nSo, b must be 11 multiplied by some number that's coprime with 350's factors (2,5,7). Because if the number had any of these factors, the GCF would be higher.\n\nSo, b=11*k, where k is an integer that's coprime with 350.\n\nThen, the LCM of 350 and b would be LCM(350,11k). Since 350 and 11k are coprime except for 11, which isn't a factor of 350. Wait, no, 350 is 2*5^2*7, and 11 is a prime not present in 350.\n\nSo, the LCM of 350 and 11k would be 350 *11k divided by GCF(350,11k). But since 350 and 11k have GCF=1 (because 350 has no 11, and k is coprime with 350's factors), so GCF(350,11k)=1.\n\nThus, LCM(350,11k) =350 *11k.\n\nBut the problem says LCM is 7700.\n\nSo, 350 *11k =7700.\n\nSo, 350*11k=7700 \u2192 3850k=7700 \u2192 k=7700/3850=2.\n\nSo, k=2. So, b=11*2=22.\n\nWait, but 22 is one of the options? Let me check the options. The options are A)242, B)308, C)352, D)412, E)456.\n\nNo, 22 isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, wait a minute. Let me re-express this.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the LCM. Let me think again.\n\nIf a and b have GCF g, then LCM(a,b) = (a*b)/g.\n\nSo, in our case, a=350, b=11k, GCF=11.\n\nSo, LCM(350,11k)= (350 *11k)/11 =350 *k.\n\nAnd this is supposed to be 7700.\n\nSo, 350 *k =7700 \u2192 k=7700/350=22.\n\nSo, k=22.\n\nSo, b=11 *22=242.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated GCF(350,242), I got 2, not 11. So this suggests a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is that k=22 isn't coprime with 350. Because if k has factors that are in 350, then the GCF would be higher than 11.\n\nWait, because in this approach, b=11*k, and k must be such that it's coprime with 350. But in this case, k=22=2*11. So, 22 shares a factor of 2 with 350, which is 2*5^2*7.\n\nSo, the GCF of 350 and 11k would be 11 * GCF(350/(11), k). Wait, no, the GCF is the product of the minimum exponents of shared primes.\n\nWait, 350 is 2*5^2*7, and 11k is 11 * (2*11)=2*11^2. So, the shared prime factors between 350 and 11k are 2. So the GCF would be 2, not 11. Which is what we saw earlier.\n\nSo this approach leads to a problem because the GCF isn't 11, it's 2. So the initial approach must be wrong.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to ensure that k is coprime with 350, i.e., k shares no common factors with 350 beyond 1.\n\nSo, let's re-express the problem.\n\nWe have a=350, which is 2*5^2*7.\n\nWe need to find b such that GCF(a,b)=11, and LCM(a,b)=7700.\n\nSo, since GCF is 11, both a and b must be multiples of 11.\n\nBut a=350 isn't a multiple of 11. So this is impossible. So, the problem as stated has no solution. But the options are given, so perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, but the problem says the GCF is 11, and one of the numbers is 350, which isn't a multiple of 11. That's impossible. So perhaps the problem is wrong. But the options are given, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that 350 is a multiple of 11, but perhaps I made a calculation mistake.\n\nWait, 11 * 32 is 352. 350 is 352 minus 2. So 350 is not a multiple of 11.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps the problem is incorrect, but since the options are given, maybe I should proceed.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the problem.\n\nGiven that GCF is 11, and LCM is 7700, and a=350. Then, using the formula, a*b = GCF * LCM \u2192 350 *b=11*7700=84700 \u2192 b=84700/350=242.\n\nSo, the other number is 242. But as we saw, GCF(350,242)=2, not 11. So, this can't be correct. So perhaps the problem has a mistake, but since the options are given, perhaps I should choose 242 as the answer, assuming that the problem is correct and I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the other number must have 11 as a factor, and then adjust.\n\nWait, perhaps I should factor 7700 and see.\n\n7700 divided by 100 is 77, so 7700=77*100=7*11 * 2^2 *5^2.\n\nSo, 7700=2^2 *5^2 *7 *11.\n\nSo, the two numbers a and b must have a GCF of 11, so their prime factors must include 11, and no higher common factors.\n\nSo, a is 350=2*5^2*7.\n\nSo, the other number, b, must be a multiple of 11, but not share any other prime factors with 350 beyond 11.\n\nSo, b=11*m, where m is an integer that doesn't share any prime factors with 350, i.e., m must not be divisible by 2,5, or7.\n\nBecause if m had any of these factors, then the GCF of a and b would be higher than 11.\n\nSo, m must be coprime with 350.\n\nNow, the LCM of a and b is 7700.\n\nWe can express the LCM in terms of the prime factors.\n\na=2 *5^2 *7.\n\nb=11 * m, where m is coprime with a.\n\nSo, LCM(a,b) would be the product of the highest powers of all primes present in a and b.\n\nSo, LCM(a,b)=2^max(1, exponents in m for 2) *5^max(2, exponents in m for 5) *7^max(1, exponents in m for 7) *11^max(0,1) * any other primes in m.\n\nBut since m is coprime with a, which is 2*5^2*7, m cannot have 2,5, or7 as factors. So, exponents for 2,5,7 in m are zero.\n\nSo, LCM(a,b)=2^1 *5^2 *7^1 *11^1 * (other primes in m). But since the LCM is given as 7700=2^2 *5^2 *7 *11.\n\nComparing, we have:\n\nOur LCM is 2^1 *5^2 *7^1 *11^1 * (other primes in m). But the given LCM is 2^2 *5^2 *7 *11.\n\nSo, the exponents for 2 in our calculation is 1, but the given is 2. So, that suggests that m must have a factor of 2 to make the exponent of 2 in LCM as 2.\n\nBut m can't have 2 as a factor because m is coprime with a (which includes 2). So this is a contradiction.\n\nWait, this suggests that m must have a factor of 2, but that would make it not coprime with a. So, this is impossible. So, perhaps the problem is impossible, but the options are given, so perhaps the answer is 242 despite the GCF being 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the initial approach and select 242 as the answer, even though it doesn't meet the GCF condition. But that would be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach and the correct answer is 242.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think again about the formula. The formula a*b = GCF(a,b)*LCM(a,b) is always true. So, using that, I get b=242. But then, the GCF is 2, not 11. So that's a problem.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is incorrect, but the intended answer is 242, which is option A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem states that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11, and their least common multiple (LCM) is 7700. One of the integers is given as 350, and the task is to find the other integer.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n\n1. **Relationship Between GCF and LCM**:  \n   The product of two integers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm a bit new to these kinds of questions, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about.\n\nThe question says that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11. Oh right, GCF is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. So both numbers are multiples of 11.\n\nThen it says the least common multiple (LCM) of these two integers is 7700. LCM is the smallest number that both numbers divide into. So, both numbers must be factors of 7700.\n\nOne of the integers is 350, and I need to find the other. The options are given as A to E.\n\nHmm, I remember there's a relationship between GCF and LCM of two numbers. Oh right, the product of the two numbers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM. So, if the numbers are a and b, then a * b = GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b).\n\nSo, using that formula, I can plug in the known values. Let me write that down.\n\nGiven:\nGCF(a, b) = 11\nLCM(a, b) = 7700\na = 350\nWe need to find b.\n\nSo, according to the formula: a * b = GCF * LCM\nSo, 350 * b = 11 * 7700\n\nLet me compute 11 multiplied by 7700. Wait, 7700 divided by 11 is 700, because 11*700 is 7700. Wait, no, wait. 11 * 700 is 7700, right? Because 700*10 is 7000, plus 700 is 7700. So 11 *7700 is 11 * (700 *11), which is 700 * 121. Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me just calculate 11 * 7700.\n\n11 times 7700. 7700 times 10 is 77,000, plus another 7700 is 84,700. So 11*7700 is 84,700.\n\nSo the equation is 350 * b = 84,700.\n\nTo find b, I can divide 84,700 by 350.\n\nHmm, let me calculate that. 350 goes into 84,700 how many times?\n\nFirst, let's see 350 times 200 is 70,000. Subtract that from 84,700, which leaves 14,700.\n\n350 times 40 is 14,000. So 200 +40 =240, and 350*240 = 84,000. Then, 14,700 -14,000 is 700. 350 goes into 700 exactly 2 times. So 240 +2=242.\n\nSo, 350 *242 =84,700. So b must be 242. Looking at the options, option A is 242. So that's the answer. But wait, let me make sure.\n\nWait, but I should also check if 242 and 350 have a GCF of 11. Because sometimes, the formula gives a number, but maybe there's a mistake in the approach.\n\nSo, let me find the GCF of 350 and 242.\n\nFirst, factor both numbers.\n\n350: Let's see, 350 divided by 2 is 175. 175 is 5*35, which is 5*5*7. So 350 is 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242: Let's see, 242 divided by 2 is 121. 121 is 11 squared. So 242 is 2 *11^2.\n\nSo, the common factors: both have a 2. But wait, the GCF is given as 11. Hmm, that's a problem. Because according to this, the GCF would be 2, not 11.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake in my calculation?\n\nWait, no. Because 350 is 2 *5^2 *7 and 242 is 2 *11^2. So the common factors are just 2. But the GCF is supposed to be 11. That's a contradiction.\n\nSo, my earlier approach must be wrong. Or maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me check the formula again. Oh wait, I think I might have confused the formula. The product of the numbers is equal to GCF multiplied by LCM. So, 350 * b = 11 *7700.\n\nWait, 11 *7700 is 84,700. 350 times 242 is 84,700, correct. But their GCF is 2, not 11. So that can't be.\n\nHmm, so that means I must have made a mistake in my initial approach. Maybe the formula applies only when the numbers are co-prime? No, I don't think so. The formula should hold regardless.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the GCF. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, 350 and 242. Let me find the GCF using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nSo, GCF(350,242). \n\nStep 1: 350 divided by 242 is 1 with a remainder of 108 (because 242 *1 =242; 350-242=108).\n\nStep 2: Now find GCF(242,108).\n\n242 divided by 108 is 2 (108*2=216), remainder is 26 (242-216=26).\n\nStep3: GCF(108,26).\n\n108 \u00f726 =4, 26*4=104. Remainder 4.\n\nStep4: GCF(26,4).\n\n26 \u00f74=6, 4*6=24. Remainder 2.\n\nStep5: GCF(4,2).\n\n4 \u00f72=2, remainder 0. So GCF is 2.\n\nSo yes, the GCF is 2, not 11. But the question says the GCF is 11. So that's a problem. Which means that 242 can't be the correct answer. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, so what's wrong here? Did I miscalculate the product? Let me check the product again.\n\n350 *242: 350 *200 =70,000; 350 *40=14,000; 350 *2=700. So 70,000 +14,000=84,000; plus 700 is 84,700. Correct.\n\nAnd 11 *7700=84,700. So the product is correct, but the GCF is 2, not 11. So that's a problem.\n\nHmm, so maybe the initial assumption that the other number is 242 is wrong because it doesn't satisfy the GCF condition. So what did I do wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is correct, but in this case, the other number must be such that both numbers have 11 as a GCF. So, perhaps I should factor 350 and see if it's a multiple of 11.\n\nWait, 350 divided by 11: 11*31 is 341, 350-341=9. So 350 is not divisible by 11. So how can the GCF be 11? Because if one number is 350, which isn't a multiple of 11, and the other is a multiple of 11, the GCF would be 11 only if 350 is also a multiple of 11. Wait, that's not possible. So is the question wrong?\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me double-check: 350 is 35 *10. 35 is 5*7, 10 is 2*5. So 350 is 2*5^2*7. So it's not divisible by 11. So how can the GCF be 11? Because GCF is the product of the minimum exponents of shared prime factors. So if one number is 350 (which doesn't have 11 as a factor), and the other has 11 as a factor, then the GCF can't be 11. Because 350 doesn't have 11 as a factor, so the GCF can't include 11.\n\nWait, so that means there's a mistake in the problem statement? Or perhaps I misunderstood the question.\n\nWait, the problem says the GCF is 11. So both numbers must be multiples of 11. Because GCF is 11, which is a prime. So both numbers must have 11 as a factor.\n\nBut 350 isn't a multiple of 11. 350 /11 is approximately 31.818..., which isn't an integer. So this is impossible. So perhaps the question is incorrect. But the options are given, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. The formula says a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So, if GCF is 11, and a is 350, which is not a multiple of 11, that can't be. So maybe the initial premise is impossible. But the question is given, so perhaps I've made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. Maybe I can express 350 as a multiple of 11. Let me see. 350 divided by 11 is approximately 31.818. So it's not a multiple. So how can the GCF be 11?\n\nWait, this suggests that the problem has no solution. But the options are given, so perhaps I've made a mistake in my approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is correct, and I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should proceed differently. Let me think about the properties of GCF and LCM.\n\nIf the GCF of two numbers is 11, then both numbers can be expressed as 11 multiplied by two coprime integers. Because GCF is 11, so when you divide each number by 11, the resulting numbers are coprime (their GCF is 1).\n\nSo let me write the two numbers as:\n\na = 11 * m\n\nb = 11 * n\n\nWhere m and n are coprime integers (their GCF is 1).\n\nThen, the LCM of a and b would be 11 * m * n, because LCM(a,b) = (a*b)/GCF(a,b) = (11m *11n)/11 = 11 m n.\n\nSo, given that LCM(a, b) is 7700, which is 7700 =11 * m *n.\n\nSo, m * n = 7700 /11 = 700.\n\nSo, m * n =700.\n\nAlso, since a is 350, which is 11 * m. So, 350 =11 * m \u2192 m=350/11.\n\nWait, 350 divided by 11 is approximately 31.818, which isn't an integer. So m isn't an integer. That can't be right. Because m must be an integer since a is 11*m.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the problem is impossible because 350 isn't a multiple of 11. But the problem states that one of the numbers is 350. So perhaps I've made a mistake in understanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating something. Let me recheck 350 \u00f711.\n\n11 * 31 = 341. 350-341=9. So 350=11*31 +9. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. So this can't be possible. So the problem as stated is impossible, because the GCF can't be 11 if one number isn't a multiple of 11.\n\nBut the options are given, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the question had a typo, but assuming the question is correct, maybe I should proceed differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me try another way.\n\nSo, the formula says a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So, 350 * b =11 *7700.\n\nWhich gives b= (11*7700)/350.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nCompute 11 *7700 = 84,700.\n\nThen 84,700 \u00f7350.\n\nWell, 350 times 242 is 84,700. So that's correct. But as earlier, 350 and 242 have a GCF of 2, not 11. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, the product is correct. But the GCF is not matching. So perhaps the problem is wrong, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the options to see if any of them, when multiplied by 350, give 84,700 and have a GCF of 11 with 350.\n\nWait, but 350 is not a multiple of 11, so any other number that is a multiple of 11 when multiplied by 350 would have a product of 11*(something), but 350 doesn't have 11 as a factor, so the GCF of 350 and any multiple of 11 would be 1, not 11.\n\nWait, but that's conflicting with the problem statement. So I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem intended that the GCF is 11, but one of the numbers isn't 350. Or perhaps I'm misapplying the formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach should be to find the other number such that the GCF is 11 and the LCM is 7700, given that one number is 350.\n\nWait, perhaps I should find the other number b such that GCF(350, b)=11 and LCM(350, b)=7700.\n\nSo, using the formula:\n\n350 * b = 11 *7700 \u2192 350*b=84700 \u2192 b=84700/350=242.\n\nBut as before, 350 and 242 have a GCF of 2, not 11. So that's a problem. So perhaps the problem has an error.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the other number is 242, but the GCF is 2, which contradicts the problem statement. So perhaps the question is wrong. But the options are given, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me try to find the other number such that GCF is 11.\n\nSo, let me factor 350. 350=2*5^2*7.\n\nThe other number, let's call it b, must have 11 as a factor, but no higher common factors with 350 beyond 11. Because GCF is 11.\n\nSo, the prime factors of b must include 11, and any other factors must not be present in 350 beyond what's in 11.\n\nSo, 350's factors are 2,5,7.\n\nSo, b must be 11 multiplied by some number that's coprime with 350's factors (2,5,7). Because if the number had any of these factors, the GCF would be higher.\n\nSo, b=11*k, where k is an integer that's coprime with 350.\n\nThen, the LCM of 350 and b would be LCM(350,11k). Since 350 and 11k are coprime except for 11, which isn't a factor of 350. Wait, no, 350 is 2*5^2*7, and 11 is a prime not present in 350.\n\nSo, the LCM of 350 and 11k would be 350 *11k divided by GCF(350,11k). But since 350 and 11k have GCF=1 (because 350 has no 11, and k is coprime with 350's factors), so GCF(350,11k)=1.\n\nThus, LCM(350,11k) =350 *11k.\n\nBut the problem says LCM is 7700.\n\nSo, 350 *11k =7700.\n\nSo, 350*11k=7700 \u2192 3850k=7700 \u2192 k=7700/3850=2.\n\nSo, k=2. So, b=11*2=22.\n\nWait, but 22 is one of the options? Let me check the options. The options are A)242, B)308, C)352, D)412, E)456.\n\nNo, 22 isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, wait a minute. Let me re-express this.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the LCM. Let me think again.\n\nIf a and b have GCF g, then LCM(a,b) = (a*b)/g.\n\nSo, in our case, a=350, b=11k, GCF=11.\n\nSo, LCM(350,11k)= (350 *11k)/11 =350 *k.\n\nAnd this is supposed to be 7700.\n\nSo, 350 *k =7700 \u2192 k=7700/350=22.\n\nSo, k=22.\n\nSo, b=11 *22=242.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated GCF(350,242), I got 2, not 11. So this suggests a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is that k=22 isn't coprime with 350. Because if k has factors that are in 350, then the GCF would be higher than 11.\n\nWait, because in this approach, b=11*k, and k must be such that it's coprime with 350. But in this case, k=22=2*11. So, 22 shares a factor of 2 with 350, which is 2*5^2*7.\n\nSo, the GCF of 350 and 11k would be 11 * GCF(350/(11), k). Wait, no, the GCF is the product of the minimum exponents of shared primes.\n\nWait, 350 is 2*5^2*7, and 11k is 11 * (2*11)=2*11^2. So, the shared prime factors between 350 and 11k are 2. So the GCF would be 2, not 11. Which is what we saw earlier.\n\nSo this approach leads to a problem because the GCF isn't 11, it's 2. So the initial approach must be wrong.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to ensure that k is coprime with 350, i.e., k shares no common factors with 350 beyond 1.\n\nSo, let's re-express the problem.\n\nWe have a=350, which is 2*5^2*7.\n\nWe need to find b such that GCF(a,b)=11, and LCM(a,b)=7700.\n\nSo, since GCF is 11, both a and b must be multiples of 11.\n\nBut a=350 isn't a multiple of 11. So this is impossible. So, the problem as stated has no solution. But the options are given, so perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, but the problem says the GCF is 11, and one of the numbers is 350, which isn't a multiple of 11. That's impossible. So perhaps the problem is wrong. But the options are given, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that 350 is a multiple of 11, but perhaps I made a calculation mistake.\n\nWait, 11 * 32 is 352. 350 is 352 minus 2. So 350 is not a multiple of 11.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps the problem is incorrect, but since the options are given, maybe I should proceed.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the problem.\n\nGiven that GCF is 11, and LCM is 7700, and a=350. Then, using the formula, a*b = GCF * LCM \u2192 350 *b=11*7700=84700 \u2192 b=84700/350=242.\n\nSo, the other number is 242. But as we saw, GCF(350,242)=2, not 11. So, this can't be correct. So perhaps the problem has a mistake, but since the options are given, perhaps I should choose 242 as the answer, assuming that the problem is correct and I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the other number must have 11 as a factor, and then adjust.\n\nWait, perhaps I should factor 7700 and see.\n\n7700 divided by 100 is 77, so 7700=77*100=7*11 * 2^2 *5^2.\n\nSo, 7700=2^2 *5^2 *7 *11.\n\nSo, the two numbers a and b must have a GCF of 11, so their prime factors must include 11, and no higher common factors.\n\nSo, a is 350=2*5^2*7.\n\nSo, the other number, b, must be a multiple of 11, but not share any other prime factors with 350 beyond 11.\n\nSo, b=11*m, where m is an integer that doesn't share any prime factors with 350, i.e., m must not be divisible by 2,5, or7.\n\nBecause if m had any of these factors, then the GCF of a and b would be higher than 11.\n\nSo, m must be coprime with 350.\n\nNow, the LCM of a and b is 7700.\n\nWe can express the LCM in terms of the prime factors.\n\na=2 *5^2 *7.\n\nb=11 * m, where m is coprime with a.\n\nSo, LCM(a,b) would be the product of the highest powers of all primes present in a and b.\n\nSo, LCM(a,b)=2^max(1, exponents in m for 2) *5^max(2, exponents in m for 5) *7^max(1, exponents in m for 7) *11^max(0,1) * any other primes in m.\n\nBut since m is coprime with a, which is 2*5^2*7, m cannot have 2,5, or7 as factors. So, exponents for 2,5,7 in m are zero.\n\nSo, LCM(a,b)=2^1 *5^2 *7^1 *11^1 * (other primes in m). But since the LCM is given as 7700=2^2 *5^2 *7 *11.\n\nComparing, we have:\n\nOur LCM is 2^1 *5^2 *7^1 *11^1 * (other primes in m). But the given LCM is 2^2 *5^2 *7 *11.\n\nSo, the exponents for 2 in our calculation is 1, but the given is 2. So, that suggests that m must have a factor of 2 to make the exponent of 2 in LCM as 2.\n\nBut m can't have 2 as a factor because m is coprime with a (which includes 2). So this is a contradiction.\n\nWait, this suggests that m must have a factor of 2, but that would make it not coprime with a. So, this is impossible. So, perhaps the problem is impossible, but the options are given, so perhaps the answer is 242 despite the GCF being 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the initial approach and select 242 as the answer, even though it doesn't meet the GCF condition. But that would be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach and the correct answer is 242.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think again about the formula. The formula a*b = GCF(a,b)*LCM(a,b) is always true. So, using that, I get b=242. But then, the GCF is 2, not 11. So that's a problem.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is incorrect, but the intended answer is 242, which is option A.\n\n\nThe problem states that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11, and their least common multiple (LCM) is 7700. One of the integers is given as 350, and the task is to find the other integer.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n\n1. **Relationship Between GCF and LCM**:  \n   The product of two integers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM. Mathematically,  \n   \\[\n   a \\times b = \\text{GCF}(a, b) \\times \\text{LCM}(a, b)\n   \\]  \n   Substituting the given values:  \n   \\[\n   350 \\times b = 11 \\times 7700\n   \\]  \n   Simplifying:  \n   \\[\n   350 \\times b = 84700 \\implies b = \\frac{84700}{350} = 242\n   \\]\n\n2. **Verification of GCF**:  \n   The GCF of 350 and 242 must be 11. Factoring both numbers:  \n   - \\(350 = 2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7\\)  \n   - \\(242 = 2 \\times 11^2\\)  \n   The only common prime factor is 2, so the GCF is 2, not 11. This contradicts the problem's condition.\n\n3. **Revisiting the Formula**:  \n   The formula \\(a \\times b = \\text{GCF}(a, b) \\times \\text{LCM}(a, b)\\) is universally valid. Using this formula, the other integer is calculated as 242. However, the GCF condition is not satisfied, indicating a potential issue with the problem's consistency.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:  \n   Despite the contradiction in the GCF condition, the formula yields \\(b = 242\\). Given the options, 242 is the only plausible answer, assuming the problem intends for this result.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**Answer: A**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it again carefully. The problem says that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11, and their least common multiple (LCM) is 7700. One of the integers is 350, and I need to find the other one from the given options.\n\nHmm, I remember that there's a relationship between the GCF and LCM of two numbers. I think the formula involves multiplying the two numbers together and relating it to the GCF and LCM. Oh right! The product of the two numbers equals the product of their GCF and LCM. So, if the numbers are a and b, then a * b = GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b).\n\nSo, given that, I can plug in the values I know. One number is 350, the GCF is 11, and the LCM is 7700. Let me write that down:\n\n350 * x = 11 * 7700.\n\nWait, what's x here? That's the other number I'm trying to find. So I can solve for x by dividing both sides by 350.\n\nBut wait, let me compute 11 * 7700 first. 11 multiplied by 7700. Let me think, 7700 *10 is 77000, and 7700*1 is 7700. So 77000 +7700 is 84700. So 350 * x = 84700.\n\nTo find x, I divide 84700 by 350. Let me compute that. 350 goes into 84700 how many times?\n\nAlternatively, I can simplify the division. Let me see: 84700 divided by 350. Both numbers can be divided by 50. 84700 \u00f750 is 1694, and 350 \u00f750 is 7. So now it's 1694 divided by 7.\n\nLet me do that division. 7 into 1694.\n\n7 into 16 is 2, 2*7=14, remainder 2. Bring down 9: 29. 7 into 29 is 4, 4*7=28, remainder 1. Bring down 4: 14. 7 into 14 is 2. So 242.\n\nWait, that gives x=242. But let me check because 350 times 242 equals 84700? Let me compute 350*242.\n\n350 * 200 is 70,000. 350*40 is 14,000, so 70k +14k=84,000. 350*2=700. So 84,000 +700=84,700. Yes, that's correct. So x is 242.\n\nWait, but the options are A)242, B)308, etc. So the answer would be A)242.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. I should also check if 11 is indeed the GCF of 350 and 242. Because sometimes, when you find a number through the formula, it's possible that the GCF isn't as given. So let's find the GCF of 350 and 242.\n\nTo find the GCF, I can use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nFirst, divide 350 by 242. 242*1=242, subtract from 350: 350-242=108. So now, GCD(242,108).\n\n242 divided by 108 is 2 times, which is 216. Subtract: 242-216=26. Now GCD(108,26).\n\n108 divided by 26 is 4 times (26*4=104). Subtract: 108-104=4. Now GCD(26,4).\n\n26 divided by 4 is 6 times (24). Subtract: 26-24=2. GCD(4,2).\n\n4 divided by 2 is 2 times, no remainder. So GCD is 2.\n\nWait, that's a problem because the GCF is supposed to be 11. So that means I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nHmm. So my initial approach might be wrong. Because according to the formula, the product of the numbers is GCF * LCM. So 350 * x =11 *7700=84700. So x=84700/350=242.\n\nBut the GCF of 350 and 242 is 2, not 11. That's a contradiction. So why is that happening?\n\nWait, so maybe my approach is incorrect. Perhaps I made a mistake in using the formula. Let me double-check the formula.\n\nThe formula is correct: a * b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So if a is 350, b is x, then 350*x = 11 *7700. So x is 242. But the GCF of 350 and 242 is 2, which contradicts the given GCF of 11. So there must be a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps the formula is correct, but I have to ensure that the two numbers have a GCF of 11. So maybe 242 is not the correct answer because the GCF is wrong. So perhaps I made a mistake in my initial approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should represent the numbers in terms of their prime factors.\n\nLet me factorize 350. 350 is 35 * 10, which is 5*7 * 2*5. So 2 *5^2 *7.\n\nThe GCF of the two numbers is 11, which is a prime number. So both numbers must be multiples of 11. So each number can be written as 11 multiplied by some integer.\n\nSo let me denote the two numbers as 11m and 11n, where m and n are integers that are coprime (their GCF is 1). Because if m and n had any common factors, the GCF would be higher than 11.\n\nNow, the LCM of 11m and 11n is 11 * m * n, because m and n are coprime. Because the LCM of two numbers is the product of the highest powers of all primes present in either number. Since m and n are coprime, their LCM is m*n.\n\nSo, given that the LCM is 7700, which is 7700 =11 * m *n.\n\nSo 11*m*n=7700. Therefore, m*n=7700/11 = 700.\n\nSo m * n =700, and m and n are coprime.\n\nAlso, one of the numbers is 350. Let's see, 350 is 11*m or 11*n?\n\nWait, 350 divided by 11 is approximately 31.818, which isn't an integer. Because 11 *31=341, 11*32=352. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. Wait, that can't be right because both numbers have to be multiples of 11 since their GCF is 11.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because if one of the numbers is 350, which is not a multiple of 11, that would contradict the fact that the GCF is 11. Because both numbers must be multiples of their GCF.\n\nSo there's a mistake here. Because the initial assumption is that the GCF is 11, which means both numbers must be divisible by 11. But 350 is not divisible by 11. Let me check 350 divided by 11.\n\n11 *31 is 341, 341 +11=352. So 350 is 352-2, so 350 mod 11 is 350-341=9. So 350 is not divisible by 11. That's a problem.\n\nWait, but the problem says that one of the integers is 350. That implies that 350 must be a multiple of 11, but it's not. So perhaps I'm missing something. Did I read the problem correctly?\n\nWait, the problem states that the GCF of the two numbers is 11. So both numbers must be multiples of 11. But 350 is not a multiple of 11. So that's a contradiction. So how can the problem state that one of the integers is 350? That suggests that either the problem is wrong or I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me re-examine. The GCF is 11, so both numbers must be divisible by 11. So 350 must be divisible by 11. But 350 \u00f711 is 31.818..., which is not an integer. So that's impossible. So perhaps the question is wrong, or I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the question is correct, but I made a mistake in my calculations. Let me recheck 350 divided by 11.\n\n11 * 31 = 341, 11*32=352. So 350 is between 31 and 32 times 11. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. That means that if one of the numbers is 350, and the GCF is 11, that's impossible because 350 isn't a multiple of 11. So that suggests that there's no such number, but the problem says there is, so I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again. It says that the GCF is 11, the LCM is 7700, and one of the integers is 350. So perhaps 350 is a multiple of 11, but I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute 350 \u00f711 more carefully.\n\n11 * 30 =330. 350-330=20. 20 \u00f711 is 1 with remainder 9. So 350 is 31 *11 +9. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. So that's a problem.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the problem might have a typo, but assuming it's correct, perhaps I'm missing something else. Alternatively, maybe I should approach the problem differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula I used is correct, but the GCF is 11, and the numbers are 350 and 242. But as I saw earlier, the GCF of 350 and 242 is 2, not 11. So that's a problem.\n\nSo perhaps the approach to use the formula is correct, but then the numbers must have a GCF of 11, so 350 must be a multiple of 11, which it isn't. So perhaps the answer isn't 242, but another number.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the GCF of 350 and 242. Let me do that again.\n\nCompute GCF(350,242):\n\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n350 divided by 242: 242*1=242, 350-242=108. So GCF(242,108).\n\n242 divided by 108: 108*2=216, 242-216=26. Now GCF(108,26).\n\n108 \u00f726: 26*4=104, 108-104=4. Now GCF(26,4).\n\n26 \u00f74: 4*6=24, remainder 2. Now GCF(4,2).\n\n4 \u00f72=2, no remainder. So GCF is 2.\n\nSo yes, the GCF is 2, which contradicts the given GCF of 11.\n\nSo that suggests that the initial approach using the formula is leading me to an incorrect GCF. So perhaps I need to find a number x such that the GCF of 350 and x is 11, and their LCM is 7700.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Let me denote the two numbers as a=350 and b=x. We know that GCF(a,b)=11, and LCM(a,b)=7700.\n\nExpress a and b as a=11*m, b=11*n, where m and n are coprime (their GCF is 1). Then, LCM(a,b)=11*m*n.\n\nGiven that, LCM(a,b)=7700=11 * m *n. So m*n=7700/11=700.\n\nSo m *n=700, and m and n are coprime.\n\nAlso, since a=350=11*m, that would imply m=350/11. But 350 \u00f711 is approximately 31.818, which isn't an integer. So that's a problem. So that suggests that the given a is not a multiple of 11, which contradicts the fact that GCF(a,b)=11.\n\nWait, so this is the crux of the problem. If the GCF is 11, then both a and b must be multiples of 11. But 350 is not a multiple of 11, which means the problem as stated is impossible. So perhaps the problem is wrong, but assuming it's correct, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is correct, and I'm miscalculating. Let me recheck 350 \u00f711.\n\n11 * 31 = 341. 341 +9=350. So 350=11*31 +9. So no, it's not a multiple of 11. So the problem is impossible as stated.\n\nWait, but the problem says that one of the integers is 350. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but the options include 350 being one of the numbers, but that's impossible because 350 isn't a multiple of 11.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the formula. Wait, no, the formula is correct: a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b).\n\nSo if a=350, GCF=11, LCM=7700, then 350 *x=11 *7700=84700. So x=84700/350=242.\n\nBut as we saw, the GCF of 350 and 242 is 2, not 11. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, the problem's numbers are inconsistent.\n\nBut the problem is given, so perhaps I'm missing something else. Maybe I should check the options again.\n\nWait, the options are A)242, B)308, C)352, D)412, E)456.\n\nWait, maybe another option would work. Let's see what the other options would give.\n\nLet me check option B)308. Let's see if 350 and 308 have GCF 11.\n\nCompute GCF(350,308).\n\nUsing Euclidean algorithm:\n\n350 divided by 308 is 1, remainder 42.\n\nSo GCF(308,42).\n\n308 \u00f742: 42*7=294, remainder 14.\n\nGCF(42,14). 42 \u00f714=3, remainder 0. So GCF is 14.\n\nNot 11. So no.\n\nOption C)352.\n\nCheck if 350 and 352 have GCF 11.\n\nCompute GCF(350,352).\n\n350 and 352 differ by 2. So 352=350+2.\n\nSo GCF(350,2). 350 is even, so GCF is 2. Not 11.\n\nSo no.\n\nOption D)412.\n\nCheck GCF(350,412).\n\nUsing Euclidean algorithm:\n\n412 \u00f7350=1, remainder 62.\n\nGCF(350,62).\n\n350 \u00f762: 62*5=310, remainder 40.\n\nGCF(62,40).\n\n62 \u00f740=1, remainder 22.\n\nGCF(40,22).\n\n40 \u00f722=1, remainder 18.\n\nGCF(22,18).\n\n22 \u00f718=1, remainder 4.\n\nGCF(18,4).\n\n18 \u00f74=4, remainder 2.\n\nGCF(4,2)=2.\n\nSo GCF is 2, not 11.\n\nOption E)456.\n\nCompute GCF(350,456).\n\n456 \u00f7350=1, remainder 106.\n\nGCF(350,106).\n\n350 \u00f7106: 106*3=318, remainder 32.\n\nGCF(106,32).\n\n106 \u00f732=3, remainder 10.\n\nGCF(32,10).\n\n32 \u00f710=3, rem 2.\n\nGCF(10,2)=2.\n\nSo again, GCF is 2.\n\nSo none of the options, except perhaps none, would have a GCF of 11 with 350. But the problem says that one of the numbers is 350, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me check 350 \u00f711 again. 11*31=341, 341+9=350. So no, it's not a multiple.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is incorrect, but since the options are given, I need to pick from them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the formula regardless of the GCF, but that would be incorrect. So perhaps the problem has a typo, but since I have to choose an answer, perhaps the correct answer is 242, as per the formula, even though the GCF isn't 11.\n\nBut that would be incorrect because the problem states that the GCF is 11.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the GCF of 350 and 242. Let me check again.\n\nCompute GCF(350,242).\n\n350 \u00f7242=1, rem 108.\n\n242 \u00f7108=2, rem 26.\n\n108 \u00f726=4, rem 4.\n\n26 \u00f74=6, rem 2.\n\n4 \u00f72=2, rem 0. So GCF is 2.\n\nSo that's correct. So 242 can't be the correct answer because GCF is 2, not 11.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is incorrect, but among the options, perhaps 242 is the only one that satisfies the LCM condition, even if the GCF isn't 11.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. Let me factorize 350 and see.\n\n350 = 2 *5^2 *7.\n\nThe GCF is 11, so 11 must be a factor of both numbers. So the other number must be a multiple of 11.\n\nSo let me denote the other number as x=11k, where k is an integer.\n\nThen, the LCM of 350 and x is 7700.\n\nThe LCM of two numbers is the product divided by the GCF. So LCM(350,11k) = (350 *11k) / GCF(350,11k).\n\nWe know that the LCM is 7700, so:\n\n(350 *11k) / GCF(350,11k) =7700.\n\nLet me compute 350 *11k = 3850k.\n\nSo 3850k / GCF(350,11k) =7700.\n\nWe can rearrange this as GCF(350,11k)=3850k /7700= (3850/7700)*k= 0.5k.\n\nBut GCF is a positive integer. So 0.5k must be an integer. That implies that k must be even.\n\nLet me denote k=2m, where m is an integer.\n\nSo GCF(350,11*2m)=GCF(350,22m).\n\nBut 350 is 2*5^2*7.\n\n22m is 2*11*m.\n\nThe GCF is the product of the minimum exponents of shared prime factors.\n\nSo 350 and 22m share the prime 2. So GCF is 2 * GCF(175,11m).\n\nWait, because 350=2*175, and 22m=2*11m.\n\nSo the GCF would be 2 * GCF(175,11m).\n\nBut 175 is 5^2*7.\n\n11m is 11*m.\n\nSince 175 and 11 are coprime (no common factors except 1), the GCF(175,11m) is GCF(175,m).\n\nSo GCF(350,22m)=2 * GCF(175, m).\n\nBut according to earlier, GCF(350,22m)=0.5k=0.5*(2m)=m.\n\nSo 2 * GCF(175, m) = m.\n\nSo 2 * GCF(175, m) =m.\n\nLet me denote d= GCF(175, m). So d divides 175 and m.\n\nSo 2d =m.\n\nSince d divides m, and m=2d, then d must divide 2d, which it does.\n\nAlso, d divides 175.\n\nSo d is a divisor of 175.\n\nThe divisors of 175 are 1,5,7,25,35,175.\n\nSo possible d values:1,5,7,25,35,175.\n\nThus, m=2d.\n\nSo m can be 2,10,14,50,70,350.\n\nSo x=11k=11*(2m)=22m.\n\nWait, no: earlier I set k=2m. So x=11k=11*(2m)=22m.\n\nWait, but m is 2d, so x=22*(2d)=44d.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express this.\n\nWait, m=2d, so x=11k=11*(2m)=22m=22*(2d)=44d.\n\nSo x=44d.\n\nNow, since x must be such that the LCM is 7700, let's see which d values lead to x being one of the options.\n\nThe options are 242, 308, 352,412,456.\n\nLet me compute 44d for d in {1,5,7,25,35,175}.\n\nd=1: 44*1=44. Not an option.\n\nd=5:44*5=220. Not an option.\n\nd=7:44*7=308. Option B is 308.\n\nd=25:44*25=1100. Not an option.\n\nd=35:44*35=1540. Not an option.\n\nd=175:44*175=7700. Not an option.\n\nSo the only x in the options is 308, when d=7.\n\nSo x=308.\n\nNow, let's check if this works.\n\nSo the numbers are 350 and 308.\n\nCompute their GCF.\n\nUsing Euclidean algorithm:\n\n350 and 308.\n\n350 \u00f7308=1, remainder 42.\n\n308 \u00f742=7, remainder 14.\n\n42 \u00f714=3, remainder 0. So GCF is 14.\n\nWait, but we expected GCF to be 11. So this is a problem.\n\nHmm, that can't be right. So even though x=308 is an option, the GCF is 14, not 11.\n\nSo this suggests that perhaps the only possible x is 308, but it doesn't satisfy the GCF condition. So I'm stuck again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.\n\nWe have:\n\nx=44d, where d is a divisor of 175, and d is one of 1,5,7,25,35,175.\n\nSo when d=7, x=308.\n\nBut when I checked, the GCF is 14, not 11. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the assumption that GCF(350,22m)=2* GCF(175, m) is correct, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me re-express the problem.\n\nWe have:\n\nLCM(350, x) =7700.\n\nx must be a multiple of 11.\n\nLet me factorize 7700.\n\n7700=77 *100 =7*11 * 2^2 *5^2.\n\n350=2*5^2 *7.\n\nSo the LCM of 350 and x must be 7700=2^2 *5^2 *7 *11.\n\nSo x must have the prime factors 11, and any combination of 2,5,7, but not more than the exponents in 7700.\n\nAlso, since GCF(350, x)=11, the only common prime factor between 350 and x is 11. So x must have 11 as a factor, but no other primes in common with 350.\n\n350's prime factors are 2,5,7.\n\nSo x can't have 2,5, or7 as factors, because that would increase the GCF beyond 11.\n\nWait, that's a key point! So x must be a multiple of 11, but not a multiple of 2,5, or7. Because if x had any of those, the GCF would include that factor, making the GCF higher than 11.\n\nSo x must be of the form 11 *k, where k is an integer that's not divisible by 2,5, or7.\n\nSo let's see the options:\n\nOption A)242: 242=2*11^2. So it's divisible by 2 and 11. So it has 2 as a factor, which 350 also has, so the GCF would be at least 2*11=22, which is higher than 11. So that's not possible.\n\nOption B)308:308=4*77=4*7*11. So it's divisible by 4,7, and 11. So 350 has 7 as a factor, so the GCF would include 7 and 11, making it 77. So that's higher than 11. So no.\n\nOption C)352:352=32 *11=2^5 *11. So it's divisible by 2 and 11. So GCF would be 2*11=22. So no.\n\nOption D)412:412=4*103. 4 is 2^2. So it's divisible by 2. So GCF would be 2*11=22. No.\n\nOption E)456:456=8*57=8*3*19. So it's divisible by 2 and 3 and 19. So GCF would be 2*11=22. No.\n\nWait, so none of the options are acceptable because they all share factors with 350 other than 11. So this suggests that there's no possible x in the options that satisfies the conditions, but the problem says one of them is.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the only possible x is 242, but as I saw earlier, it doesn't have the correct GCF. So perhaps the problem is designed to have 242 as the answer, despite the GCF being wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think again about the formula.\n\nWe have:\n\na * b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b).\n\n350 * x =11 *7700=84700.\n\nx=84700/350=242.\n\nSo x must be 242, but as we saw, the GCF is 2. So the problem's numbers are inconsistent. But perhaps the answer is 242, as per the formula, regardless of the GCF.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption that both numbers must be multiples of 11. Because if the GCF is 11, then yes, both must be multiples of 11. But 350 isn't, so perhaps the problem is incorrect.\n\nBut given the options, the only possible answer is 242, even though it's incorrect in terms of the GCF.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing a key point. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the other number is 242, and the GCF is indeed 11, but I made a mistake in the GCF calculation.\n\nWait, let me compute GCF(350,242) again.\n\n350 and 242.\n\n350 \u00f7242=1, remainder 108.\n\n242 \u00f7108=2, remainder 26.\n\n108 \u00f726=4, remainder 4.\n\n26 \u00f74=6, remainder 2.\n\n4 \u00f72=2, rem 0.\n\nSo the GCF is 2. So that's correct.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is incorrect, but the intended answer is 242, so option A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem states that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11, their least common multiple (LCM) is 7700, and one of the integers is 350.

This contradicts the problem's condition that the GCF is 11.\n\n3. **Analysis of Options**:  \n   Each option is checked for whether it satisfies the GCF condition with 350:  \n   - **A) 242**: GCF(350, 242) = 2 (not 11).  \n   - **B) 308**: GCF(350, 308) = 14 (not 11).  \n   - **C) 352**: GCF(350, 352) = 2 (not 11).  \n   - **D) 412**: GCF(350, 412) = 2 (not 11).  \n   - **E) 456**: GCF(350, 456) = 2 (not 11).  \n\n   None of the options satisfy the GCF condition of 11. However, based on the formula, **242** is the only value that satisfies the LCM condition, even though it fails the GCF condition.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe problem's conditions are inconsistent, as no option satisfies both the GCF and LCM requirements. However, the only value derived from the formula is **242**, making it the most plausible answer despite the contradiction.\n\n**Answer: A**",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it again carefully. The problem says that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11, and their least common multiple (LCM) is 7700. One of the integers is 350, and I need to find the other one from the given options.\n\nHmm, I remember that there's a relationship between the GCF and LCM of two numbers. I think the formula involves multiplying the two numbers together and relating it to the GCF and LCM. Oh right! The product of the two numbers equals the product of their GCF and LCM. So, if the numbers are a and b, then a * b = GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b).\n\nSo, given that, I can plug in the values I know. One number is 350, the GCF is 11, and the LCM is 7700. Let me write that down:\n\n350 * x = 11 * 7700.\n\nWait, what's x here? That's the other number I'm trying to find. So I can solve for x by dividing both sides by 350.\n\nBut wait, let me compute 11 * 7700 first. 11 multiplied by 7700. Let me think, 7700 *10 is 77000, and 7700*1 is 7700. So 77000 +7700 is 84700. So 350 * x = 84700.\n\nTo find x, I divide 84700 by 350. Let me compute that. 350 goes into 84700 how many times?\n\nAlternatively, I can simplify the division. Let me see: 84700 divided by 350. Both numbers can be divided by 50. 84700 \u00f750 is 1694, and 350 \u00f750 is 7. So now it's 1694 divided by 7.\n\nLet me do that division. 7 into 1694.\n\n7 into 16 is 2, 2*7=14, remainder 2. Bring down 9: 29. 7 into 29 is 4, 4*7=28, remainder 1. Bring down 4: 14. 7 into 14 is 2. So 242.\n\nWait, that gives x=242. But let me check because 350 times 242 equals 84700? Let me compute 350*242.\n\n350 * 200 is 70,000. 350*40 is 14,000, so 70k +14k=84,000. 350*2=700. So 84,000 +700=84,700. Yes, that's correct. So x is 242.\n\nWait, but the options are A)242, B)308, etc. So the answer would be A)242.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. I should also check if 11 is indeed the GCF of 350 and 242. Because sometimes, when you find a number through the formula, it's possible that the GCF isn't as given. So let's find the GCF of 350 and 242.\n\nTo find the GCF, I can use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nFirst, divide 350 by 242. 242*1=242, subtract from 350: 350-242=108. So now, GCD(242,108).\n\n242 divided by 108 is 2 times, which is 216. Subtract: 242-216=26. Now GCD(108,26).\n\n108 divided by 26 is 4 times (26*4=104). Subtract: 108-104=4. Now GCD(26,4).\n\n26 divided by 4 is 6 times (24). Subtract: 26-24=2. GCD(4,2).\n\n4 divided by 2 is 2 times, no remainder. So GCD is 2.\n\nWait, that's a problem because the GCF is supposed to be 11. So that means I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nHmm. So my initial approach might be wrong. Because according to the formula, the product of the numbers is GCF * LCM. So 350 * x =11 *7700=84700. So x=84700/350=242.\n\nBut the GCF of 350 and 242 is 2, not 11. That's a contradiction. So why is that happening?\n\nWait, so maybe my approach is incorrect. Perhaps I made a mistake in using the formula. Let me double-check the formula.\n\nThe formula is correct: a * b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So if a is 350, b is x, then 350*x = 11 *7700. So x is 242. But the GCF of 350 and 242 is 2, which contradicts the given GCF of 11. So there must be a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps the formula is correct, but I have to ensure that the two numbers have a GCF of 11. So maybe 242 is not the correct answer because the GCF is wrong. So perhaps I made a mistake in my initial approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should represent the numbers in terms of their prime factors.\n\nLet me factorize 350. 350 is 35 * 10, which is 5*7 * 2*5. So 2 *5^2 *7.\n\nThe GCF of the two numbers is 11, which is a prime number. So both numbers must be multiples of 11. So each number can be written as 11 multiplied by some integer.\n\nSo let me denote the two numbers as 11m and 11n, where m and n are integers that are coprime (their GCF is 1). Because if m and n had any common factors, the GCF would be higher than 11.\n\nNow, the LCM of 11m and 11n is 11 * m * n, because m and n are coprime. Because the LCM of two numbers is the product of the highest powers of all primes present in either number. Since m and n are coprime, their LCM is m*n.\n\nSo, given that the LCM is 7700, which is 7700 =11 * m *n.\n\nSo 11*m*n=7700. Therefore, m*n=7700/11 = 700.\n\nSo m * n =700, and m and n are coprime.\n\nAlso, one of the numbers is 350. Let's see, 350 is 11*m or 11*n?\n\nWait, 350 divided by 11 is approximately 31.818, which isn't an integer. Because 11 *31=341, 11*32=352. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. Wait, that can't be right because both numbers have to be multiples of 11 since their GCF is 11.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because if one of the numbers is 350, which is not a multiple of 11, that would contradict the fact that the GCF is 11. Because both numbers must be multiples of their GCF.\n\nSo there's a mistake here. Because the initial assumption is that the GCF is 11, which means both numbers must be divisible by 11. But 350 is not divisible by 11. Let me check 350 divided by 11.\n\n11 *31 is 341, 341 +11=352. So 350 is 352-2, so 350 mod 11 is 350-341=9. So 350 is not divisible by 11. That's a problem.\n\nWait, but the problem says that one of the integers is 350. That implies that 350 must be a multiple of 11, but it's not. So perhaps I'm missing something. Did I read the problem correctly?\n\nWait, the problem states that the GCF of the two numbers is 11. So both numbers must be multiples of 11. But 350 is not a multiple of 11. So that's a contradiction. So how can the problem state that one of the integers is 350? That suggests that either the problem is wrong or I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me re-examine. The GCF is 11, so both numbers must be divisible by 11. So 350 must be divisible by 11. But 350 \u00f711 is 31.818..., which is not an integer. So that's impossible. So perhaps the question is wrong, or I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the question is correct, but I made a mistake in my calculations. Let me recheck 350 divided by 11.\n\n11 * 31 = 341, 11*32=352. So 350 is between 31 and 32 times 11. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. That means that if one of the numbers is 350, and the GCF is 11, that's impossible because 350 isn't a multiple of 11. So that suggests that there's no such number, but the problem says there is, so I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again. It says that the GCF is 11, the LCM is 7700, and one of the integers is 350. So perhaps 350 is a multiple of 11, but I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute 350 \u00f711 more carefully.\n\n11 * 30 =330. 350-330=20. 20 \u00f711 is 1 with remainder 9. So 350 is 31 *11 +9. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. So that's a problem.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the problem might have a typo, but assuming it's correct, perhaps I'm missing something else. Alternatively, maybe I should approach the problem differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula I used is correct, but the GCF is 11, and the numbers are 350 and 242. But as I saw earlier, the GCF of 350 and 242 is 2, not 11. So that's a problem.\n\nSo perhaps the approach to use the formula is correct, but then the numbers must have a GCF of 11, so 350 must be a multiple of 11, which it isn't. So perhaps the answer isn't 242, but another number.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the GCF of 350 and 242. Let me do that again.\n\nCompute GCF(350,242):\n\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n350 divided by 242: 242*1=242, 350-242=108. So GCF(242,108).\n\n242 divided by 108: 108*2=216, 242-216=26. Now GCF(108,26).\n\n108 \u00f726: 26*4=104, 108-104=4. Now GCF(26,4).\n\n26 \u00f74: 4*6=24, remainder 2. Now GCF(4,2).\n\n4 \u00f72=2, no remainder. So GCF is 2.\n\nSo yes, the GCF is 2, which contradicts the given GCF of 11.\n\nSo that suggests that the initial approach using the formula is leading me to an incorrect GCF. So perhaps I need to find a number x such that the GCF of 350 and x is 11, and their LCM is 7700.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Let me denote the two numbers as a=350 and b=x. We know that GCF(a,b)=11, and LCM(a,b)=7700.\n\nExpress a and b as a=11*m, b=11*n, where m and n are coprime (their GCF is 1). Then, LCM(a,b)=11*m*n.\n\nGiven that, LCM(a,b)=7700=11 * m *n. So m*n=7700/11=700.\n\nSo m *n=700, and m and n are coprime.\n\nAlso, since a=350=11*m, that would imply m=350/11. But 350 \u00f711 is approximately 31.818, which isn't an integer. So that's a problem. So that suggests that the given a is not a multiple of 11, which contradicts the fact that GCF(a,b)=11.\n\nWait, so this is the crux of the problem. If the GCF is 11, then both a and b must be multiples of 11. But 350 is not a multiple of 11, which means the problem as stated is impossible. So perhaps the problem is wrong, but assuming it's correct, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is correct, and I'm miscalculating. Let me recheck 350 \u00f711.\n\n11 * 31 = 341. 341 +9=350. So 350=11*31 +9. So no, it's not a multiple of 11. So the problem is impossible as stated.\n\nWait, but the problem says that one of the integers is 350. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but the options include 350 being one of the numbers, but that's impossible because 350 isn't a multiple of 11.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the formula. Wait, no, the formula is correct: a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b).\n\nSo if a=350, GCF=11, LCM=7700, then 350 *x=11 *7700=84700. So x=84700/350=242.\n\nBut as we saw, the GCF of 350 and 242 is 2, not 11. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, the problem's numbers are inconsistent.\n\nBut the problem is given, so perhaps I'm missing something else. Maybe I should check the options again.\n\nWait, the options are A)242, B)308, C)352, D)412, E)456.\n\nWait, maybe another option would work. Let's see what the other options would give.\n\nLet me check option B)308. Let's see if 350 and 308 have GCF 11.\n\nCompute GCF(350,308).\n\nUsing Euclidean algorithm:\n\n350 divided by 308 is 1, remainder 42.\n\nSo GCF(308,42).\n\n308 \u00f742: 42*7=294, remainder 14.\n\nGCF(42,14). 42 \u00f714=3, remainder 0. So GCF is 14.\n\nNot 11. So no.\n\nOption C)352.\n\nCheck if 350 and 352 have GCF 11.\n\nCompute GCF(350,352).\n\n350 and 352 differ by 2. So 352=350+2.\n\nSo GCF(350,2). 350 is even, so GCF is 2. Not 11.\n\nSo no.\n\nOption D)412.\n\nCheck GCF(350,412).\n\nUsing Euclidean algorithm:\n\n412 \u00f7350=1, remainder 62.\n\nGCF(350,62).\n\n350 \u00f762: 62*5=310, remainder 40.\n\nGCF(62,40).\n\n62 \u00f740=1, remainder 22.\n\nGCF(40,22).\n\n40 \u00f722=1, remainder 18.\n\nGCF(22,18).\n\n22 \u00f718=1, remainder 4.\n\nGCF(18,4).\n\n18 \u00f74=4, remainder 2.\n\nGCF(4,2)=2.\n\nSo GCF is 2, not 11.\n\nOption E)456.\n\nCompute GCF(350,456).\n\n456 \u00f7350=1, remainder 106.\n\nGCF(350,106).\n\n350 \u00f7106: 106*3=318, remainder 32.\n\nGCF(106,32).\n\n106 \u00f732=3, remainder 10.\n\nGCF(32,10).\n\n32 \u00f710=3, rem 2.\n\nGCF(10,2)=2.\n\nSo again, GCF is 2.\n\nSo none of the options, except perhaps none, would have a GCF of 11 with 350. But the problem says that one of the numbers is 350, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me check 350 \u00f711 again. 11*31=341, 341+9=350. So no, it's not a multiple.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is incorrect, but since the options are given, I need to pick from them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the formula regardless of the GCF, but that would be incorrect. So perhaps the problem has a typo, but since I have to choose an answer, perhaps the correct answer is 242, as per the formula, even though the GCF isn't 11.\n\nBut that would be incorrect because the problem states that the GCF is 11.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the GCF of 350 and 242. Let me check again.\n\nCompute GCF(350,242).\n\n350 \u00f7242=1, rem 108.\n\n242 \u00f7108=2, rem 26.\n\n108 \u00f726=4, rem 4.\n\n26 \u00f74=6, rem 2.\n\n4 \u00f72=2, rem 0. So GCF is 2.\n\nSo that's correct. So 242 can't be the correct answer because GCF is 2, not 11.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is incorrect, but among the options, perhaps 242 is the only one that satisfies the LCM condition, even if the GCF isn't 11.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. Let me factorize 350 and see.\n\n350 = 2 *5^2 *7.\n\nThe GCF is 11, so 11 must be a factor of both numbers. So the other number must be a multiple of 11.\n\nSo let me denote the other number as x=11k, where k is an integer.\n\nThen, the LCM of 350 and x is 7700.\n\nThe LCM of two numbers is the product divided by the GCF. So LCM(350,11k) = (350 *11k) / GCF(350,11k).\n\nWe know that the LCM is 7700, so:\n\n(350 *11k) / GCF(350,11k) =7700.\n\nLet me compute 350 *11k = 3850k.\n\nSo 3850k / GCF(350,11k) =7700.\n\nWe can rearrange this as GCF(350,11k)=3850k /7700= (3850/7700)*k= 0.5k.\n\nBut GCF is a positive integer. So 0.5k must be an integer. That implies that k must be even.\n\nLet me denote k=2m, where m is an integer.\n\nSo GCF(350,11*2m)=GCF(350,22m).\n\nBut 350 is 2*5^2*7.\n\n22m is 2*11*m.\n\nThe GCF is the product of the minimum exponents of shared prime factors.\n\nSo 350 and 22m share the prime 2. So GCF is 2 * GCF(175,11m).\n\nWait, because 350=2*175, and 22m=2*11m.\n\nSo the GCF would be 2 * GCF(175,11m).\n\nBut 175 is 5^2*7.\n\n11m is 11*m.\n\nSince 175 and 11 are coprime (no common factors except 1), the GCF(175,11m) is GCF(175,m).\n\nSo GCF(350,22m)=2 * GCF(175, m).\n\nBut according to earlier, GCF(350,22m)=0.5k=0.5*(2m)=m.\n\nSo 2 * GCF(175, m) = m.\n\nSo 2 * GCF(175, m) =m.\n\nLet me denote d= GCF(175, m). So d divides 175 and m.\n\nSo 2d =m.\n\nSince d divides m, and m=2d, then d must divide 2d, which it does.\n\nAlso, d divides 175.\n\nSo d is a divisor of 175.\n\nThe divisors of 175 are 1,5,7,25,35,175.\n\nSo possible d values:1,5,7,25,35,175.\n\nThus, m=2d.\n\nSo m can be 2,10,14,50,70,350.\n\nSo x=11k=11*(2m)=22m.\n\nWait, no: earlier I set k=2m. So x=11k=11*(2m)=22m.\n\nWait, but m is 2d, so x=22*(2d)=44d.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express this.\n\nWait, m=2d, so x=11k=11*(2m)=22m=22*(2d)=44d.\n\nSo x=44d.\n\nNow, since x must be such that the LCM is 7700, let's see which d values lead to x being one of the options.\n\nThe options are 242, 308, 352,412,456.\n\nLet me compute 44d for d in {1,5,7,25,35,175}.\n\nd=1: 44*1=44. Not an option.\n\nd=5:44*5=220. Not an option.\n\nd=7:44*7=308. Option B is 308.\n\nd=25:44*25=1100. Not an option.\n\nd=35:44*35=1540. Not an option.\n\nd=175:44*175=7700. Not an option.\n\nSo the only x in the options is 308, when d=7.\n\nSo x=308.\n\nNow, let's check if this works.\n\nSo the numbers are 350 and 308.\n\nCompute their GCF.\n\nUsing Euclidean algorithm:\n\n350 and 308.\n\n350 \u00f7308=1, remainder 42.\n\n308 \u00f742=7, remainder 14.\n\n42 \u00f714=3, remainder 0. So GCF is 14.\n\nWait, but we expected GCF to be 11. So this is a problem.\n\nHmm, that can't be right. So even though x=308 is an option, the GCF is 14, not 11.\n\nSo this suggests that perhaps the only possible x is 308, but it doesn't satisfy the GCF condition. So I'm stuck again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.\n\nWe have:\n\nx=44d, where d is a divisor of 175, and d is one of 1,5,7,25,35,175.\n\nSo when d=7, x=308.\n\nBut when I checked, the GCF is 14, not 11. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the assumption that GCF(350,22m)=2* GCF(175, m) is correct, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me re-express the problem.\n\nWe have:\n\nLCM(350, x) =7700.\n\nx must be a multiple of 11.\n\nLet me factorize 7700.\n\n7700=77 *100 =7*11 * 2^2 *5^2.\n\n350=2*5^2 *7.\n\nSo the LCM of 350 and x must be 7700=2^2 *5^2 *7 *11.\n\nSo x must have the prime factors 11, and any combination of 2,5,7, but not more than the exponents in 7700.\n\nAlso, since GCF(350, x)=11, the only common prime factor between 350 and x is 11. So x must have 11 as a factor, but no other primes in common with 350.\n\n350's prime factors are 2,5,7.\n\nSo x can't have 2,5, or7 as factors, because that would increase the GCF beyond 11.\n\nWait, that's a key point! So x must be a multiple of 11, but not a multiple of 2,5, or7. Because if x had any of those, the GCF would include that factor, making the GCF higher than 11.\n\nSo x must be of the form 11 *k, where k is an integer that's not divisible by 2,5, or7.\n\nSo let's see the options:\n\nOption A)242: 242=2*11^2. So it's divisible by 2 and 11. So it has 2 as a factor, which 350 also has, so the GCF would be at least 2*11=22, which is higher than 11. So that's not possible.\n\nOption B)308:308=4*77=4*7*11. So it's divisible by 4,7, and 11. So 350 has 7 as a factor, so the GCF would include 7 and 11, making it 77. So that's higher than 11. So no.\n\nOption C)352:352=32 *11=2^5 *11. So it's divisible by 2 and 11. So GCF would be 2*11=22. So no.\n\nOption D)412:412=4*103. 4 is 2^2. So it's divisible by 2. So GCF would be 2*11=22. No.\n\nOption E)456:456=8*57=8*3*19. So it's divisible by 2 and 3 and 19. So GCF would be 2*11=22. No.\n\nWait, so none of the options are acceptable because they all share factors with 350 other than 11. So this suggests that there's no possible x in the options that satisfies the conditions, but the problem says one of them is.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the only possible x is 242, but as I saw earlier, it doesn't have the correct GCF. So perhaps the problem is designed to have 242 as the answer, despite the GCF being wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think again about the formula.\n\nWe have:\n\na * b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b).\n\n350 * x =11 *7700=84700.\n\nx=84700/350=242.\n\nSo x must be 242, but as we saw, the GCF is 2. So the problem's numbers are inconsistent. But perhaps the answer is 242, as per the formula, regardless of the GCF.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption that both numbers must be multiples of 11. Because if the GCF is 11, then yes, both must be multiples of 11. But 350 isn't, so perhaps the problem is incorrect.\n\nBut given the options, the only possible answer is 242, even though it's incorrect in terms of the GCF.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing a key point. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the other number is 242, and the GCF is indeed 11, but I made a mistake in the GCF calculation.\n\nWait, let me compute GCF(350,242) again.\n\n350 and 242.\n\n350 \u00f7242=1, remainder 108.\n\n242 \u00f7108=2, remainder 26.\n\n108 \u00f726=4, remainder 4.\n\n26 \u00f74=6, remainder 2.\n\n4 \u00f72=2, rem 0.\n\nSo the GCF is 2. So that's correct.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is incorrect, but the intended answer is 242, so option A.\n\n\nThe problem states that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11, their least common multiple (LCM) is 7700, and one of the integers is 350. The task is to find the other integer from the given options.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Relationship Between GCF and LCM**:  \n   The formula connecting GCF and LCM is:  \n   \\[\n   a \\times b = \\text{GCF}(a, b) \\times \\text{LCM}(a, b)\n   \\]  \n   Substituting the given values:  \n   \\[\n   350 \\times x = 11 \\times 7700\n   \\]  \n   Simplifying:  \n   \\[\n   350 \\times x = 84700 \\implies x = \\frac{84700}{350} = 242\n   \\]  \n   Thus, the other integer is calculated to be **242**.\n\n2. **Verification of GCF**:  \n   To ensure the GCF of 350 and 242 is 11, the Euclidean algorithm is applied:  \n   - \\( 350 \\div 242 = 1 \\), remainder \\( 108 \\)  \n   - \\( 242 \\div 108 = 2 \\), remainder \\( 26 \\)  \n   - \\( 108 \\div 26 = 4 \\), remainder \\( 4 \\)  \n   - \\( 26 \\div 4 = 6 \\), remainder \\( 2 \\)  \n   - \\( 4 \\div 2 = 2 \\), remainder \\( 0 \\)  \n\n   The GCF is the last non-zero remainder, which is **2**, not 11. This contradicts the problem's condition that the GCF is 11.\n\n3. **Analysis of Options**:  \n   Each option is checked for whether it satisfies the GCF condition with 350:  \n   - **A) 242**: GCF(350, 242) = 2 (not 11).  \n   - **B) 308**: GCF(350, 308) = 14 (not 11).  \n   - **C) 352**: GCF(350, 352) = 2 (not 11).  \n   - **D) 412**: GCF(350, 412) = 2 (not 11).  \n   - **E) 456**: GCF(350, 456) = 2 (not 11).  \n\n   None of the options satisfy the GCF condition of 11. However, based on the formula, **242** is the only value that satisfies the LCM condition, even though it fails the GCF condition.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe problem's conditions are inconsistent, as no option satisfies both the GCF and LCM requirements. However, the only value derived from the formula is **242**, making it the most plausible answer despite the contradiction.\n\n**Answer: A**",
