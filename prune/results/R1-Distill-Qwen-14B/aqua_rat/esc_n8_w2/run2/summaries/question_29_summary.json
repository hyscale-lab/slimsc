      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a jeep traveling a certain distance. Hmm, let's see. The question says the jeep takes 6 hours for the forward journey. On the return trip, it increases its speed by 12 km/hr and takes 4 hours. I need to find the distance it traveled. \n\nWait, the distance should be the same for both journeys, right? Because it's going and coming back on the same path. So the distance is the same, but the speed and time are different. \n\nLet me think about the formulas. I remember that distance equals speed multiplied by time. So maybe I can set up an equation using that. \n\nLet's denote the speed during the forward journey as 'v' km/hr. Then, the distance for the forward journey would be v multiplied by 6 hours. \n\nFor the return journey, the speed is higher by 12 km/hr, so that's v + 12 km/hr. The time taken is 4 hours, so the distance is (v +12) multiplied by 4. \n\nSince both distances are the same, I can set them equal to each other. \n\nSo, 6v = 4(v + 12). \n\nLet me expand that. 6v = 4v + 48. \n\nHmm, subtracting 4v from both sides gives 2v = 48. \n\nDividing both sides by 2, I get v = 24 km/hr. \n\nOh, so the forward speed is 24 km/hr. Now, to find the distance, I can plug this back into either equation. Let's use the forward journey distance: 6 hours * 24 km/hr = 144 km. \n\nWait, checking the options, option B is 144 km. So that's probably the answer. \n\nBut wait, let me verify with the return journey. Return speed is 24 +12 = 36 km/hr. Time is 4 hours. 36 *4 = 144. Yep, same distance. So it's correct. \n\nI think that's all. So the distance is 144 km.\n",

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nAlright, the problem says that the jeep takes 6 hours for the forward journey. Then, on the return trip, it increases its speed by 12 km/h and takes 4 hours. I guess I can set up some equations to solve for the distance.\n\nWait, right, distance equals speed multiplied by time. So for the forward journey, let's denote the speed as v. Then the distance would be v multiplied by 6 hours. So that's D = v * 6.\n\nOn the return trip, the speed is higher by 12 km/h, so the speed becomes v + 12. And the time taken is 4 hours. So the distance here would be (v + 12) * 4.\n\nBut wait, the distance for both journeys should be the same because it's the same path, just going and returning. Oh right, because it's a round trip. So the distance D is the same both ways. That means I can set these two expressions equal to each other.\n\nSo, v * 6 = (v + 12) * 4. Now I can solve for v. Let's expand the right side: 4v + 48. So the equation becomes 6v = 4v + 48.\n\nSubtracting 4v from both sides gives 2v = 48. Dividing both sides by 2, v is 24 km/h. Oh, that's the speed during the forward journey.\n\nNow I can find the distance D by plugging v back into the first equation. D = 24 * 6. Let me calculate that: 24 * 6 is 144. So the distance is 144 km.\n\nWait, looking at the options, option B is 144 km. So that must be the correct answer.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So v was 24 km/h. On the return trip, speed is 36 km/h. Time is 4 hours. So 36 *4 is 144. Yep, same as before. So the distance is definitely 144 km.\n",
