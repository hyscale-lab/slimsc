      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about estimating the deer population in a forest. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on population estimation methods, but I'll try to think it out.\n\nAlright, the problem says that in 2001, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and then released back into the forest. Then, in 2002, they caught 500 deer at random, and out of those, only 20 were found to have tags from the previous year. The question is asking for the total deer population in the forest, assuming the population hasn't changed between 2001 and 2002.\n\nHmm, I remember something about mark-recapture methods being used for estimating animal populations. The basic idea is that you tag a certain number of animals, release them, and then later capture another sample and see what fraction are tagged. Then you can use that to estimate the total population.\n\nThe formula I think is something like (number tagged initially) divided by (total population) equals (number recaptured with tags) divided by (total captured in the second sample). So, like:\n\n(Tagged in first capture) / (Total population) = (Tagged in second capture) / (Total in second capture)\n\nWait, let me make sure I have that right. So the proportion of tagged deer in the second sample should reflect the proportion in the entire population.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber tagged initially (N1) = 300.\n\nNumber recaptured (N2) = 500.\n\nNumber of recaptured that were tagged (R) = 20.\n\nSo according to the Lincoln-Petersen estimator, the formula is:\n\nTotal population (N) = (N1 * N2) / R\n\nWait, yeah, that sounds right. So N equals (300 * 500) divided by 20.\n\nLet me calculate that. 300 multiplied by 500 is 150,000. Then divided by 20 is 7,500. So the population estimate is 7,500.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 7500. So that's the answer.\n\nWait a second, did I mix up the numbers? Let me double-check. The initial capture was 300, which were all tagged. Then, the second capture was 500, with 20 tagged. So the ratio is 20/500 = 4% tagged in the sample. So the total population would have 4% of the total being tagged. Since there were 300 tagged deer, then 300 is 4% of the total. So 300 = 0.04 * N \u2192 N = 300 / 0.04 = 7500. Yep, same result.\n\nSo the correct answer should be E)7500.\n",

Hmm, I remember something about the capture-recapture method from ecology.

I think the basic idea is that the proportion of tagged deer in the second capture should be similar to the proportion of tagged deer in the entire population. So, if we let N be the total population, then after the first capture, we have 300 tagged deer.\n\nIn the second capture, 500 deer were caught, and 20 were tagged. So the proportion of tagged deer in the second sample is 20/500. That should equal the proportion of tagged deer in the whole population, which is 300/N.\n\nSo, the formula would be: (number tagged in second capture) / (total caught in second capture) = (total tagged) / (total population). \n\nPlugging in the numbers: 20/500 = 300/N. \n\nWait, let me write that down. 20 divided by 500 equals 300 divided by N. So 0.04 = 300/N. To solve for N, I can rearrange this equation. Multiply both sides by N: 0.04 N = 300. Then divide both sides by 0.04: N = 300 / 0.04.\n\nHmm, 300 divided by 0.04.

So the total population should be 7500 deer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up any numbers. Let me double-check. The initial capture was 300, so that's the tagged population. The second capture was 500, with 20 tagged. So 20/500 is 4% tagged. So if 4% of the total population is 300, then 0.04N = 300, which gives N=7500.
