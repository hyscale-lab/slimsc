      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to solve it step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe question is [(272 - 32) (124 + 176)] divided by (17 multiplied by 15 minus 15). And I have to choose the correct answer from the options A to E.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. I think I should handle the operations inside the brackets first, according to the order of operations, right? So, I'll start with each part.\n\nFirst part: (272 - 32). Let me do that subtraction. 272 minus 32 is... 240? Wait, 32 is like 30 plus 2. 272 minus 30 is 242, then minus 2 is 240. Yeah, that's right.\n\nSecond part: (124 + 176). Adding those together. Let me add 124 and 176. Hmm, 124 plus 176. Let's see, 124 + 176. 120 + 170 is 290, and 4 + 6 is 10. So 290 +10 is 300. Oh wait, that's easy. So the numerator part is 240 multiplied by 300.\n\nSo the numerator is (240) * (300). Let me calculate that. 240 times 300. Well, 24 times 3 is 72, and then I have two zeros from 240 and two zeros from 300, so total four zeros. So 72 with four zeros is 720,000. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 240 is 2.4e2 and 300 is 3e2. Multiply them: 2.4 * 3 = 7.2, and 10^2 *10^2 is 10^4, so 7.2e4 is 72,000. Oh, right, because 240 is 2.4*10^2 and 300 is 3*10^2. So 2.4 *3 is 7.2, 10^2 *10^2 is 10^4, so 7.2 *10^4 is 72,000. So numerator is 72,000.\n\nNow the denominator: (17 * 15) -15. Let's compute 17 times 15 first. 17*15... Hmm, 15 times 10 is 150, 15 times 7 is 105, so 150+105=255. So 17*15 is 255. Then subtract 15: 255-15 is 240. So denominator is 240.\n\nSo now the entire expression is 72,000 divided by 240. Let me compute that. 72,000 \u00f7 240. Hmm, perhaps I can simplify this.\n\nI know that 240 times 300 is 72,000 because 240 * 300 is 72,000. So 72,000 divided by 240 is 300. Wait, let me check. 240 multiplied by 300 is indeed 72,000. So 72,000 \u00f7 240 equals 300.\n\nSo the value of the expression is 300. Looking at the options, option C is 300. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, let me double-check all my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst step: 272-32 is 240. Correct. 124+176 is 300. Correct. Then 240 * 300 is 72,000. Correct. Denominator: 17*15 is 255, minus 15 is 240. Correct. 72,000 divided by 240 is 300. Yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can simplify the calculation another way. Let's see, in the numerator, 240 * 300, and denominator is 240. So 240 cancels out. 300 remains. So yeah, that's another way to see it. So yeah, the answer is 300.\n",

Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll tackle the numerator because that's the part on top of the division line. The numerator is (272 - 32) multiplied by (124 + 176). So I'll compute each part inside the parentheses first.\n\nStarting with (272 - 32), that's straightforward subtraction. 272 minus 32 equals... let's see, 272 minus 30 is 242, minus 2 more is 240. So that part is 240.\n\nNext, (124 + 176). Adding those together: 124 plus 176. Hmm, 124 plus 170 is 294, plus 6 is 300. So that part is 300.\n\nNow, I multiply those two results together: 240 multiplied by 300. Let me calculate that. 240 * 300. Well, 24 * 3 is 72, and then adding three zeros (since 240 is 24*10 and 300 is 3*100), so 72 with five zeros? Wait, no, wait. 240 is 2.4e2 and 300 is 3e2. So 2.4 *3 is 7.2, and 10^2 * 10^2 is 10^4, so 7.2e4, which is 72,000. Oh wait, that's 72,000. Yeah, because 240*300 is 72,000.

Alternatively, maybe simplify both numbers by dividing numerator and denominator by 240's factors.\n\nWait, perhaps I can simplify the division by breaking it down. Let's see: 72,000 divided by 240. Both numbers can be divided by 10, so that's 7,200 divided by 24. That might be easier.\n\nNow, 7,200 \u00f7 24. Let me think about how many times 24 goes into 7,200. Alternatively, 24 times what gives me 7,200.\n\nLet's see, 24 times 300 is 7,200 because 24 * 300 = 7,200. So yes, 7,200 \u00f7 24 is 300.

So that's correct.\n\nSo the result is 300. Now, looking back at the options, option C is 300. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations.
