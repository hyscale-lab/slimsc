      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where two people, A and B, can build a wall in 40 and 45 minutes respectively. The question is asking how long it would take them to build the wall together. Hmm, right, I remember this is a work-rate problem.\n\nLet me think. When people work together, their rates add up. So I need to find out how much each can do in a minute and then combine those.\n\nA can build the wall in 40 minutes, so A's rate is 1 wall per 40 minutes. That would be 1/40 per minute. Similarly, B's rate is 1/45 per minute since B takes 45 minutes alone.\n\nAdding their rates together: 1/40 + 1/45. To add these fractions, I need a common denominator. Let's see, the least common multiple of 40 and 45. 40 is 8*5, and 45 is 9*5. So the LCM would be 8*9*5, which is 360.\n\nSo converting both fractions to have 360 as the denominator. 1/40 is 9/360 because 40*9=360. And 1/45 is 8/360 because 45*8=360. So adding those together, 9 + 8 = 17. So together, their combined rate is 17/360 walls per minute.\n\nWait, so their combined rate is 17/360 walls per minute. That means in one minute, they complete 17/360 of the wall. To find the total time T needed to build one wall, we set up the equation:\n\n(17/360) * T = 1\n\nSolving for T, we get T = 360/17 minutes. Let me calculate that. 360 divided by 17. Let's see, 17 times 21 is 357 (because 17*20=340, plus 17 is 357). So 360-357 is 3, so it's 21 and 3/17 minutes. 3/17 of a minute is like 3/17 *60 seconds, which is approximately 10.588 seconds. So total time is around 21 minutes and 10.588 seconds.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option D which is 21 minutes. Alternatively, wait, the options are in minutes. So 21.176 minutes approximately. Let me check if the options have 21. So yes, option D is 21 min, and option E is 20 min (but E is same as A, that's probably a typo in the options).\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake. So 17/360 per minute. So time is 360/17. Let me compute 360 divided by 17 exactly. 17*20=340, 360-340=20. So 20/17 is approximately 1.176. So 20 + 1.176 is 21.176. So about 21.176 minutes. So 21 minutes is the whole number, but the question is asking how many hours. Oh wait, no, the options are in minutes. So the time is approximately 21.176 minutes, which is about 21.18 minutes. So the answer should be 21 minutes when rounded, but wait, are the options precise?\n\nWait, the options are A)20, B)22, C)23, D)21, E)20. So D is 21, which is the closest. So the correct answer should be D)21 min.\n",
