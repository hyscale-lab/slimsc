      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about oarsmen's weights. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. So, there are 10 oarsmen in a boat, and their average weight changes when one of them is replaced. The question is asking for the weight of the new man.\n\nWait, the problem says the average weight increases by 1.8 kg when a 53 kg crew member is replaced. Oh right, so the old average and the new average have a difference of 1.8 kg. Let me think about how averages work.\n\nThe average is the total weight divided by the number of people. So, initially, the total weight of the 10 oarsmen must be 10 times the original average. Let's call the original average 'A'. So total weight = 10 * A.\n\nWhen one person is replaced, the new total weight becomes (10 * A) - 53 + new man's weight. And this new total weight's average is A + 1.8, right? Because the average increased by 1.8 kg.\n\nSo the new average is (new total weight) / 10. That equals A + 1.8.\n\nLet me write that as an equation. \n\n( (10A - 53 + x) ) / 10 = A + 1.8\n\nWhere x is the weight of the new man.\n\nWait, I can solve for x. Let me multiply both sides by 10 to get rid of the denominator.\n\n10A -53 + x = 10*(A + 1.8)\n\nSimplify the right side: 10A + 18.\n\nSo now the equation is:\n\n10A -53 + x = 10A + 18\n\nHmm, I can subtract 10A from both sides. That leaves:\n\n-53 + x = 18\n\nThen, adding 53 to both sides gives:\n\nx = 18 + 53\n\nWhich is 71. So x is 71 kg. \n\nLet me double-check. The original total is 10A. When we replace a 53 kg person with a 71 kg person, the new total is 10A -53 +71 = 10A +18. The new average is (10A +18)/10 = A +1.8. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nSo the new man's weight is 71 kg. Looking at the options, A is 71. So the answer should be A.\n",

The options are given, but I'll try to work it out step by step.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding the problem. There are 10 oarsmen, and their average weight is a certain value. Then, one of them is replaced, so the average goes up by 1.8 kg. So the change in average is due to the new person's weight compared to the person they replaced.\n\nWait, the average increases by 1.8 kg. So the total weight of all the oarsmen must have increased by a certain amount, which causes the average to go up by 1.8 kg for 10 people.\n\nOh right, the average is total weight divided by the number of people. So when the average increases by 1.8 kg, the total weight increases by 1.8 multiplied by the number of people, which is 10. So that's 1.8 * 10 = 18 kg. So the total weight went up by 18 kg.\n\nBut why? Because one person was replaced. The person who left weighed 53 kg, and the new person must weigh more than 53 kg, because the total went up. So the difference between the new person's weight and 53 kg is 18 kg.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you replace someone, the change in total is (new weight - old weight). So the new person's weight must be 53 kg plus the total increase. So 53 + 18 = 71 kg. Oh, so the new man weighs 71 kg.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 71. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Original total weight is 10 * original average. After replacement, the average is original average + 1.8. So new total is 10*(original average +1.8) = original total + 18.\n\nThe change is because the new person added 18 kg more than the person they replaced. So yes, new weight is 53 +18=71.
