      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about magazine subscriptions and cover prices. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that a subscription for 15 issues costs $42.00 and that this is a 25% saving compared to buying each issue at the cover price. I need to find the cover price per issue.\n\nWait, so the subscription is cheaper than buying each issue individually. The saving is 25%, which I think means that the subscription price is 25% less than the total cover price. So, if I let the total cover price be higher than $42, then $42 is 75% of that total. Because 100% minus 25% saving is 75% of the original total.\n\nLet me write that down. Let me call the total cover price for 15 issues as T. So, the subscription cost is 75% of T. So, 42 = 0.75 * T. To find T, I can rearrange that equation. T = 42 / 0.75.\n\nCalculating that, 42 divided by 0.75. Let me do that. 0.75 is the same as 3/4, so dividing by 3/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/3. So, 42 * (4/3) equals... 42 divided by 3 is 14, multiplied by 4 is 56. So, T is $56. That's the total cover price for all 15 issues without the subscription.\n\nNow, the cover price per issue would be the total cover price divided by the number of issues. So, 56 divided by 15. Let me compute that. 56 \u00f7 15 is... well, 15 times 3 is 45, which leaves 11. So 3 with 11/15 left. 11 divided by 15 is approximately 0.7333. So, 3.7333 dollars per issue.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest would be option E which is $3.73. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes these problems can trick you.\n\nWait, I thought the subscription is 25% off the cover price. So, if each issue's cover is, say, $x, then 15x is the total cover price. The subscription is 15x minus 25% of 15x, which equals 75% of 15x. So, 0.75*(15x) = 42. So, 11.25x =42. Then x is 42 /11.25.\n\nWait a minute, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because 15x is the total cover price, and the subscription is 75% of that. So, 0.75*(15x) =42. So, 11.25x =42. So, x=42/11.25.\n\nLet me compute that. 11.25 times 3 is 33.75, 11.25 times 3.73 is what? Let me compute 42 divided by 11.25. 11.25 goes into 42 three times because 3*11.25=33.75. Subtract that from 42, you get 8.25 left. Now, 8.25 divided by 11.25 is 0.7333. So, 3.7333, which is approximately $3.73 per issue.\n\nWait, that would make the cover price per issue about $3.73, which is option E. But wait, let me think again. Because the initial approach I took was correct. The total cover price is 15x, and the subscription is 75% of that, so 0.75*15x=42.\n\nWait, 0.75 *15 is 11.25, so 11.25x=42. So x=42/11.25. Let me compute 42 divided by 11.25. 11.25 times 3 is 33.75. 42 minus 33.75 is 8.25. So, 8.25 divided by 11.25 is 0.7333. So, x=3.7333. So, approximately $3.73 per issue. So, the answer should be E.\n\nBut wait, looking back, the first method I used said the total cover price is 56, and 56/15 is about 3.7333. That matches the second method. So, both approaches give the same result.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option E is $3.73, which is exactly what we get. So, that's the correct answer.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the cover price per issue, we start by noting that the subscription cost of $42.00 represents a 25% saving compared to the total cover price for 15 issues.
