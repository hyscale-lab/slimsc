      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about tire costs, and I need to figure out the percentage difference in average cost per year between buying new tires and repairing the current ones. Hmm, let me think step by step.\n\nAlright, first, the problem states that new tires last for four years and cost $180 each. Alternatively, you can repair the current tires for $40 each, which makes them last one extra year. So, the customer is deciding between buying new tires or repairing their existing ones.\n\nWait, wait, I should clarify: when they repair, does that mean the tires can last one more year beyond their original lifespan, or do they just get an extra year? The problem says when purchased new, tires last four years. So if the customer already has tires, maybe those tires have been used for some time. But the problem doesn't specify how old the current tires are. Oh, but wait, the repair makes them last for one additional year. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the repair adds one year to the current tires' life, regardless of how long they've been used. But the question is about the average cost per year for each option.\n\nSo, I think the problem is comparing two options:\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Cost is $180 per tire. They last four years. So the average cost per year would be total cost divided by the number of years they last.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires for $40 each, which adds one more year. So the current tires (maybe they were already used for some time, but I don't think that matters here because the repair just gives an extra year). Wait, but the problem says the customer can choose to repair. So perhaps the current tires are about to expire or something. Or maybe the repair is an alternative to buying new. Let me think: when you repair, you pay $40 per tire, and that makes the tires last one more year. So, how long do the tires last after repair? Four years, because new tires last four. Or wait, no: when purchased new, they last four years. So if the current tires are old, say, maybe they've been used for a few years, but the repair makes them last one more year. Or perhaps the repair adds an extra year beyond their current lifespan.\n\nWait, maybe the way to think about it is: if you repair, you pay $40 now, and the tires will last one more year. So, perhaps the tires were going to last, say, three years, and the repair makes them last four. Or maybe they were about to wear out, and the repair gives them an extra year. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the new tires last four years, and the repair makes the current tires last four years as well? No, the problem says the repair makes them last for one additional year. Oh, so if the current tires are already, say, three years old, the repair would make them last one more year beyond that. But without knowing how old they are, perhaps the problem is considering the two options as starting from the same point.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model each option as a choice for a single tire, and compute the average cost per year for each, then find the percentage increase.\n\nSo let's break it down:\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires.\n- Cost: $180 per tire.\n- Lifespan: 4 years.\n- So, average cost per year = 180 / 4 = $45 per year.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires.\n- Cost: $40 per tire.\n- Lifespan: 1 additional year. Wait, but how many years do the tires last after repair? Because the problem says, when purchased new, tires last four years. So the current tires were perhaps already used for some time. Or perhaps the repair adds an extra year beyond their current lifespan.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of it as the current tires are going to last, say, x years, and after repair, they'll last x+1 years. But without knowing x, maybe the problem is considering that the repair allows the tires to last for four years as well. Because the new tires last four, but if you repair, they get an extra year beyond their current lifespan.\n\nHmm, maybe I should think that when you repair, the tire's lifespan becomes 4 years. Because when new, they last four, so the repair must have extended it to that. But the problem says, the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. Oh, okay, so if the current tires had, say, 2 years of life left, the repair gives them 3 years. But the problem doesn't specify their current remaining lifespan. So perhaps, the repair is in addition to their existing lifespan. That complicates things because without knowing how much life they have left, it's hard to calculate.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering that the current tires are already four years old and need to be replaced. So, the customer can either buy new tires for $180, which will last another four years, or repair the current tires for $40, which will make them last one more year. So the current tires are about to expire, and the repair gives them an extra year beyond that. So, in that case, the lifespan of the current tires after repair would be one year. Wait, that doesn't make sense because if the current tires are four years old, and you repair them, they'll last one more year, so total five years? Or perhaps, when you repair, it's an extra year beyond their original four. So, perhaps the lifespan becomes five years? Or maybe the repair is done each time, but that's not clear.\n\nI think I'm getting stuck on the details. Maybe the problem is assuming that the repair makes the current tires last one more year beyond their original lifespan. So, perhaps the original tires last four years when new, but after some time, they wear out. But if you repair, they last an extra year beyond their current lifespan.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the repair is a one-time cost that adds one year to the tire's life, regardless of how old they are. So, if the current tires are, say, two years old, the repair would make them last for three more years. But without knowing how old the tires are, we can't compute their total lifespan. So that approach might not be the right way.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is comparing the two options on a per tire basis, considering their lifespan and cost. So, for each tire:\n\nOption 1: Buy new. Cost is $180. Lasts four years. So, average cost per year is 180/4 = $45.\n\nOption 2: Repair. Cost is $40. Lasts one additional year. Wait, but one additional year compared to what? If the tire was already going to last for x years, then the repair makes it last x+1. But without knowing x, how can we compute the average cost per year?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair makes the tire last for four years as well. So, if the tire was going to last for three years, the repair makes it last four. But again, without knowing the original lifespan, it's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering that the current tires have already been in use for a certain period. Let's say the customer has used the tires for three years. Now, the tires have one year of life left. So, if the customer repairs them, they pay $40 and the tires last one more year beyond that, making the total lifespan after repair three + 1 = four years. So, the cost is $40 for four years of use. But wait, the original cost of the tires (when new) was $180, which lasts four years. So perhaps the customer has already used the tires for three years and is now deciding whether to repair or buy new.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify the current age of the tires. So maybe I should think that the customer is considering whether to replace the tires now or repair them, but regardless of their current age.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Let's model each option as a separate scenario.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Cost: $180. Lifespan: 4 years. So average cost per year is 180 /4 = $45.\n\nOption 2: Repair. Cost: $40. Lifespan: 1 more year. But wait, how many years does the tire last after repair? If the repair gives one additional year, then perhaps the total lifespan is 4 +1 =5 years? Or is it that the repair allows the tire to last one more year beyond its current state.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that the repair gives the tire one more year of life beyond its original lifespan. So, if the tire was new, it would last four years. If you repair it, perhaps it can last five years? But the problem states that the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are about to last one more year without repair. So, if you don't repair, they last one year, but if you repair, they last two years. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair adds one year to the current lifespan. So, if the tires were going to last three years, the repair makes them last four. But without knowing their current lifespan, perhaps the problem is considering that the repair adds one year to the original four years.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is structured so that the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year beyond their original four. So, the lifespan becomes five years. But that would make the average cost $40/5 = $8 per year. Then, the new tires are $180/4 = $45. So, the percentage increase would be (45-8)/8 *100% = 470% increase, which is not one of the options. So that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is done each time. Wait, but the problem says a repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So, perhaps it's a one-time repair.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering that the repair allows the tire to last for four years, same as the new tire. So, for the repair option, the tire lasts four years for $40. But that would make the average cost 40/4 = $10 per year.\n\nWait, that would make the new tires cost $45 per year, and the repair option cost $10 per year. Then the question is, the average cost of new tires is what percent greater than the repair option.\n\nWait, but the problem says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So, perhaps the original tires would have lasted, say, three years, and the repair makes them last four. But without knowing how much longer they would have lasted, I can't compute the average cost per year.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-read the problem.\n\nProblem statement: Tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years. A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year. The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\n\nSo, the new tires cost $180 and last four years. The repair is $40 and makes the current tires last one more year.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair is an alternative to buying new. So, if the customer repairs, they pay $40 and the tires last one more year. So, perhaps the current tires would have lasted, say, three years, and the repair makes them last four. So, the lifespan is four years for $40. Then, the average cost per year for the repair is 40 /4 = $10. For the new tires, it's 180 /4 = $45. So, the question is, $45 is what percent greater than $10.\n\nTo find the percentage increase: ((45 -10)/10)*100 = (35/10)*100 = 350% increase. But that's not an option. So maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year beyond their current lifespan. Suppose the current tires are already four years old and about to wear out. So, the repair would make them last one more year, so total five years. Then, the repair cost is $40, and lifespan is five years. So, average cost per year is 40/5 = $8.\n\nNew tires are $180, last four years. So average cost per year is 45.\n\nSo, the question is, 45 is what percent greater than 8.\n\nThe calculation: (45-8)/8 = 37/8 =4.625 \u2192 462.5% increase. Not an option either.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm interpreting the problem incorrectly. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year beyond their original lifespan. So, new tires last four years. If you repair, the current tires (which were new) last five years. So, the repair is done on new tires, making them last one more year. But that's not the case because the repair is for the current tires, which are already in use.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires have been used for three years and have one year left. Repairing them for $40 makes them last two more years. So, total lifespan after repair is 3+2=5 years. Then, average cost per year is 40/5 =8.\n\nBut then, if the customer buys new tires, it's $180 for four years, so 45 per year. So, 45 vs 8. Then, 45 is 462.5% higher than 8. Not an option.\n\nThis approach isn't matching any of the options, which are 8%, 10%, 12.5%, 16.7%, 25%.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me think differently. Maybe the repair is for a set period, say, the current tires are about to last for one more year without repair. So, if the customer repairs, they pay $40 and get two more years. So, lifespan is two years for $40. Then, average cost per year is 40/2=20.\n\nNew tires: 180/4=45. So, 45 is what percent greater than 20? (45-20)/20 =25/20=1.25 \u2192125% increase. Hmm, 125% is not an option either.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it differently. Let's consider each option as a way to get a certain number of years of use per tire, and compute the average cost per year.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Cost $180. Four years. So, 180/4=45/year.\n\nOption 2: Repair. Cost $40. Lifespan is one more year. But how many years of use does this give? If the current tires are already in use, perhaps they have x years left, and repairing them gives x+1 years. But without knowing x, it's hard to compute. So perhaps the problem is considering that the repair makes the tires last for four years as well.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the repair makes the tires last for four years, same as new. So, the repair cost is $40 for four years, making average cost 40/4=10/year. Then, new tires are 180/4=45. So, 45 is what percent greater than 10. (45-10)/10 =3.5 \u2192350% increase. Not an option.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to think of it in terms of the problem's wording. The repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So, perhaps the current tires, without repair, would have lasted for a certain number of years, and the repair adds one year to that. But without knowing their current state, perhaps the problem is assuming that the current tires are about to wear out, so the repair gives them one more year. So, the lifespan is one year for $40, average cost per year is 40.\n\nWait, that would mean the new tires cost 180/4=45, and the repair option is 40/1=40. So, 45 vs 40. The average cost per year of new is 45, which is 45/40 = 1.125 \u2192 12.5% greater.\n\nBut wait, let me check: (45-40)/40 *100 = (5/40)*100=12.5%. So, 12.5% increase. That's option C.\n\nWait, but why would the repair make the tires last one more year? If the current tires are about to expire, then repairing for $40 would make them last one more year. So, the average cost per year for repair is 40/1=40. New tires are 45. So, 45 is 12.5% more than 40. That would make option C the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, I thought the problem said the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So, if without repair, they would have lasted, say, three years, and with repair, four years. Then, the average cost per year would be 40/4=10. But in that case, the new tires are 45, which is 350% higher than 10. But that's not an option. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the repair extends the current tires' lifespan by one year, but the current tires were about to last for zero years without repair. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the repair is for the current tires, which are already four years old and about to expire. So, the repair makes them last one more year, so lifespan is five years. So, average cost per year is 40/5=8. Then, new tires are 45. So, 45 is (45-8)/8=37/8=4.625 \u2192462.5% higher, which is not an option.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me try to think again.\n\nThe problem states that the customer can choose between purchasing new tires (cost $180, last four years) or repair current tires (cost $40, last one additional year). The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair adds one year to the tires' current lifespan. So, if the current tires have been used for, say, three years and have one year left, then the repair makes them last two more years. So, total lifespan is four years (3+1=4). So, the repair cost is $40 for four years. So, average cost per year is 40/4=10. New tires are 180/4=45. So, 45 is what percent higher than 10.\n\n(45-10)/10=350% increase. Not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair makes the tires last for four years in total, regardless of their current state. So, if you repair, you pay $40 and get four years. So, average cost is 40/4=10.\n\nNew tires are 45. So, 45 is (45-10)/10=350% higher than 10. Still not matching options.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 350%. So maybe my approach is wrong.\n\nAnother approach: Perhaps the repair is for the current tires, which are about to expire, so the repair gives one more year. So, the lifespan is one year for $40. So, average cost is 40 per year. New tires are 45 per year. So, 45 is 12.5% higher than 40.\n\nWhich would make option C correct. That's one of the options.\n\nBut why would the repair make the tires last one year? If the tires are about to expire, then without repair, they would last zero more years. Repairing for $40 makes them last one year. So, average cost is 40/1=40.\n\nWait, but that's an extreme case. Alternatively, perhaps the repair is done when the tires have some life left. For example, if the tires have two years left, repair adds one more, making it three. So, 40/3= ~13.33 per year.\n\nBut without knowing, perhaps the problem is assuming that the repair gives one more year beyond the current lifespan, but the current lifespan is not specified. So, perhaps the intended way is to assume that the current tires are about to expire, so the repair gives one more year. Thus, average cost is 40 per year for repair, and 45 for new. So, 45 is 12.5% higher.\n\nThat would make the answer C, 12.5%.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again.\n\nIf the customer's current tires are about to expire (say, they have zero life left), repairing them would make them last one more year. So, the repair gives one year for $40, average cost 40. New tires give four years for 180, average 45.\n\nSo, the average cost of new tires is 45, which is (45/40 -1)*100 = (1.125 -1)*100=12.5% higher.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the answer is C, 12.5%.\n",

Or is it that the repair allows the tire to last one more year beyond its current state.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that the repair gives the tire one more year of life beyond its original lifespan. So, if the tire was new, it would last four years. If you repair it, perhaps it can last five years? But the problem states that the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are about to last one more year without repair. So, if you don't repair, they last one year, but if you repair, they last two years. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair adds one year to the current lifespan. So, if the tires were going to last three years, the repair makes them last four. But without knowing their current lifespan, perhaps the problem is considering that the repair adds one year to the original four years.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is structured so that the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year beyond their original four. So, the lifespan becomes five years. But that would make the average cost $40/5 = $8 per year. Then, the new tires are $180/4 = $45. So, the percentage increase would be (45-8)/8 *100% = 470% increase, which is not one of the options. So that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is done each time. Wait, but the problem says a repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So, perhaps it's a one-time repair.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering that the repair allows the tire to last for four years, same as the new tire. So, for the repair option, the tire lasts four years for $40. But that would make the average cost 40/4 = $10 per year.\n\nWait, that would make the new tires cost $45 per year, and the repair option cost $10 per year. Then the question is, the average cost of new tires is what percent greater than the repair option.\n\nWait, but the problem says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So, perhaps the original tires would have lasted, say, three years, and the repair makes them last four. But without knowing how much longer they would have lasted, I can't compute the average cost per year.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-read the problem.\n\nProblem statement: Tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years. A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year. The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\n\nSo, the new tires cost $180 and last four years. The repair is $40 and makes the current tires last one more year.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair is an alternative to buying new. So, if the customer repairs, they pay $40 and the tires last one more year. So, perhaps the current tires would have lasted, say, three years, and the repair makes them last four. So, the lifespan is four years for $40. Then, the average cost per year for the repair is 40 /4 = $10. For the new tires, it's 180 /4 = $45. So, the question is, $45 is what percent greater than $10.\n\nTo find the percentage increase: ((45 -10)/10)*100 = (35/10)*100 = 350% increase. But that's not an option. So maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year beyond their current lifespan. Suppose the current tires are already four years old and about to wear out. So, the repair would make them last one more year, so total five years. Then, the repair cost is $40, and lifespan is five years. So, average cost per year is 40/5 = $8.\n\nNew tires are $180, last four years. So average cost per year is 45.\n\nSo, the question is, 45 is what percent greater than 8.\n\nThe calculation: (45-8)/8 = 37/8 =4.625 \u2192 462.5% increase. Not an option either.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm interpreting the problem incorrectly. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year beyond their original lifespan. So, new tires last four years. If you repair, the current tires (which were new) last five years. So, the repair is done on new tires, making them last one more year. But that's not the case because the repair is for the current tires, which are already in use.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires have been used for three years and have one year left. Repairing them for $40 makes them last two more years. So, total lifespan after repair is 3+2=5 years. Then, average cost per year is 40/5 =8.\n\nBut then, if the customer buys new tires, it's $180 for four years, so 45 per year. So, 45 vs 8. Then, 45 is 462.5% higher than 8. Not an option.\n\nThis approach isn't matching any of the options, which are 8%, 10%, 12.5%, 16.7%, 25%.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me think differently. Maybe the repair is for a set period, say, the current tires are about to last for one more year without repair. So, if the customer repairs, they pay $40 and get two more years. So, lifespan is two years for $40. Then, average cost per year is 40/2=20.\n\nNew tires: 180/4=45. So, 45 is what percent greater than 20? (45-20)/20 =25/20=1.25 \u2192125% increase. Hmm, 125% is not an option either.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it differently. Let's consider each option as a way to get a certain number of years of use per tire, and compute the average cost per year.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Cost $180. Four years. So, 180/4=45/year.\n\nOption 2: Repair. Cost $40. Lifespan is one more year. But how many years of use does this give? If the current tires are already in use, perhaps they have x years left, and repairing them gives x+1 years. But without knowing x, it's hard to compute. So perhaps the problem is considering that the repair makes the tires last for four years as well.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the repair makes the tires last for four years, same as new. So, the repair cost is $40 for four years, making average cost 40/4=10/year. Then, new tires are 180/4=45. So, 45 is what percent greater than 10. (45-10)/10 =3.5 \u2192350% increase. Not an option.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to think of it in terms of the problem's wording. The repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So, perhaps the current tires, without repair, would have lasted for a certain number of years, and the repair adds one year to that. But without knowing their current state, perhaps the problem is assuming that the current tires are about to wear out, so the repair gives them one more year. So, the lifespan is one year for $40, average cost per year is 40.\n\nWait, that would mean the new tires cost 180/4=45, and the repair option is 40/1=40. So, 45 vs 40. The average cost per year of new is 45, which is 45/40 = 1.125 \u2192 12.5% greater.\n\nBut wait, let me check: (45-40)/40 *100 = (5/40)*100=12.5%. So, 12.5% increase. That's option C.\n\nWait, but why would the repair make the tires last one more year? If the current tires are about to expire, then repairing for $40 would make them last one more year. So, the average cost per year for repair is 40/1=40. New tires are 45. So, 45 is 12.5% more than 40. That would make option C the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, I thought the problem said the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So, if without repair, they would have lasted, say, three years, and with repair, four years. Then, the average cost per year would be 40/4=10. But in that case, the new tires are 45, which is 350% higher than 10. But that's not an option. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the repair extends the current tires' lifespan by one year, but the current tires were about to last for zero years without repair. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the repair is for the current tires, which are already four years old and about to expire. So, the repair makes them last one more year, so lifespan is five years. So, average cost per year is 40/5=8. Then, new tires are 45. So, 45 is (45-8)/8=37/8=4.625 \u2192462.5% higher, which is not an option.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me try to think again.\n\nThe problem states that the customer can choose between purchasing new tires (cost $180, last four years) or repair current tires (cost $40, last one additional year). The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair adds one year to the tires' current lifespan. So, if the current tires have been used for, say, three years and have one year left, then the repair makes them last two more years. So, total lifespan is four years (3+1=4). So, the repair cost is $40 for four years. So, average cost per year is 40/4=10. New tires are 180/4=45. So, 45 is what percent higher than 10.\n\n(45-10)/10=350% increase. Not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair makes the tires last for four years in total, regardless of their current state. So, if you repair, you pay $40 and get four years. So, average cost is 40/4=10.\n\nNew tires are 45. So, 45 is (45-10)/10=350% higher than 10. Still not matching options.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 350%. So maybe my approach is wrong.\n\nAnother approach: Perhaps the repair is for the current tires, which are about to expire, so the repair gives one more year. So, the lifespan is one year for $40. So, average cost is 40 per year. New tires are 45 per year. So, 45 is 12.5% higher than 40.\n\nWhich would make option C correct. That's one of the options.\n\nBut why would the repair make the tires last one year? If the tires are about to expire, then without repair, they would last zero more years. Repairing for $40 makes them last one year. So, average cost is 40/1=40.\n\nWait, but that's an extreme case. Alternatively, perhaps the repair is done when the tires have some life left. For example, if the tires have two years left, repair adds one more, making it three. So, 40/3= ~13.33 per year.\n\nBut without knowing, perhaps the problem is assuming that the repair gives one more year beyond the current lifespan, but the current lifespan is not specified. So, perhaps the intended way is to assume that the current tires are about to expire, so the repair gives one more year. Thus, average cost is 40 per year for repair, and 45 for new. So, 45 is 12.5% higher.\n\nThat would make the answer C, 12.5%.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again.\n\nIf the customer's current tires are about to expire (say, they have zero life left), repairing them would make them last one more year. So, the repair gives one year for $40, average cost 40. New tires give four years for 180, average 45.\n\nSo, the average cost of new tires is 45, which is (45/40 -1)*100 = (1.125 -1)*100=12.5% higher.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the answer is C, 12.5%.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage difference in average cost per year between purchasing new tires and repairing the current tires, we analyze the two options:\n\n### Option 1: Purchasing New Tires\n- **Cost**: $180 per tire  \n- **Lifespan**: 4 years  \n- **Average Cost per Year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\$180}{4} = \\$45 \\text{ per year}\n  \\]\n\n### Option 2: Repairing Current Tires\n- **Cost**: $40 per tire  \n- **Lifespan**: 1 additional year  \n- **Average Cost per Year**:  \n  Assuming the repair extends the tires' lifespan by one year beyond their current state, the average cost per year is:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\$40}{1} = \\$40 \\text{ per year}\n  \\]\n\n### Percentage Increase in Cost\nThe question asks for the percentage increase in the average cost per year of new tires compared to repairing the current tires. The formula for percentage increase is:  \n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{New Cost} - \\text{Repair Cost}}{\\text{Repair Cost}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:  \n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\$45 - \\$40}{\\$40} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{5}{40} \\right) \\times 100 = 12.5\\%\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe average cost per year of new tires is **12.5% greater** than the cost of repairing the current tires.  \n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about tires, and I need to figure out the percentage difference in cost per year between buying new tires and repairing the current ones. Hmm, let me break it down.\n\nSo, the problem says that new tires from a certain brand last for four years and cost $180 each. Alternatively, the customer can repair their current tires for $40 each, which adds one more year to their life. The question is asking what percent greater the average cost per year is for the new tires compared to repairing.\n\nWait, I think I should calculate the average cost per year for both options and then find out the percentage difference. Let me start with the new tires.\n\nFor the new tires: Each tire costs $180 and lasts four years. So the average cost per year would be the total cost divided by the number of years. So that's $180 divided by 4. Let me do that calculation: 180 / 4 = 45. So each year, the new tire costs $45 on average.\n\nNow, the repair option: The customer can repair their current tires for $40 each, which adds one year. So, how long do the tires last after repair? The original lifespan is four years, and repair adds one year, making it five years total. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh, wait, the question says the new tires last four years when purchased new. The customer's current tires are presumably older. So when they repair them, the current tires will last one additional year. So if the current tires were already, say, three years old, repairing them would make them last one more year, so total four years from the time of repair. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem states that the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So the total lifespan becomes the original plus one year. But how long were they used before?\n\nWait, perhaps the initial situation is that the customer's current tires are at the end of their life. So if the new tires last four years, the current ones are at year four. If you repair them, they last one more year, so five years in total. Wait, no, perhaps the current tires were already, say, x years old, but perhaps the problem is considering that the current tires are about to fail, so the repair gives them an extra year beyond what they already have. Or perhaps the repair adds one year to their life, regardless of current age. Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering that the current tires are in their fourth year, and repairing them adds one more year, making them last for five years. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the repair adds one year to the tire's life, regardless of how old they are. So, if the tires were new and you repair them, they'd last five years. But that's not the case here, because the customer is considering whether to buy new tires or repair the current ones.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated. Let's think: the customer has current tires. If they repair them, they can get one more year of use. So the current tires would last for their original lifespan plus one year. But what's the original lifespan? The problem says that new tires last four years. So the current tires, if they're new, would last four years, but if they're repaired, they'll last five years. But wait, no, the customer might not have new tires; perhaps the current tires are already a few years old. But the problem doesn't specify how old the current tires are. So maybe the assumption is that the current tires are already four years old and are about to fail. So repairing them would make them last one more year, so they would last for a total of four years (the original lifespan) plus one, making five years. Wait, but that's getting confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the repair allows the current tires to last one more year than they would without the repair. So if the current tires would normally last, say, n years, they'd last n+1 after repair. But the problem says that when you buy new tires, they last four years. So the current tires are likely at the end of their four years. So if the customer repairs them, they can get one more year, making the total lifespan five years.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the current tires are already four years old and are about to fail. So if the customer repairs them, they get one more year, making the lifespan of the current tires five years in total. But that's from the time they were new. So the cost for the repair is $40 per tire, and they get an extra year. So the average cost per year for the repair option would be total cost divided by the total years.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I'm interpreting it correctly. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe customer can choose to purchase new tires at $180 each, which last four years. Or repair current tires at $40 each, which makes them last one additional year.\n\nAh, so the repair gives an extra year beyond their current lifespan. So, for example, if the current tires were about to fail after, say, 3 years, the repair would make them last 4 years. Or perhaps the current tires have some life left, and the repair adds one more year.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires have already been used for some time. But without knowing how long, perhaps the problem assumes that the current tires are at the point where they need to be replaced, so without repair, they would last one more year. Wait, no, the problem says that the new tires last four years. So the current tires, when new, would last four years. So when the customer is thinking of repairing, perhaps the current tires are four years old and about to fail, so the repair makes them last one more year, giving a total of five years from when they were new.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the problem is simpler. Let's think in terms of cost per year.\n\nFor new tires: $180 per tire, lasts four years. So average cost per year is 180 /4 = $45 per year.\n\nFor repair: $40 per tire, and the tires last one additional year. So the total lifespan becomes four +1 = five years? Or wait, no. If the current tires are already four years old, and repair makes them last one more year, then the total lifespan is five years. But wait, that would mean the repair is adding one year beyond the original four. So the cost is $40 for that one additional year. So the average cost per year would be the total cost divided by the total years.\n\nWait, but how much has the customer already spent on the current tires? The problem doesn't say. So perhaps the problem is considering the repair as an option to extend the current tires' life by one year beyond their original four. So, the current tires would last five years total if repaired, and the customer would pay $40 for that extra year.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the cost per year for the repair would be $40 spread over the five years? Or is the repair cost per tire, and the tire lasts one additional year beyond its original lifespan.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the current tires are about to fail after four years, and the repair allows them to last for one more year, so the total lifespan is five years. So the customer pays $40 to get that fifth year.\n\nWait, but how does this affect the average cost per year? Let me think.\n\nIf the customer buys new tires: cost is $180, lasts four years. So average cost is 45 per year.\n\nIf the customer repairs: pays $40, and the tires last for one more year. So total lifespan is five years. So the total cost is $40, spread over five years. So average cost per year is 40 /5 = $8 per year.\n\nWait, that seems too low. Because if the customer's current tires were already four years old and about to fail, the repair would add one more year, making the total lifespan five years. So the cost is $40 for that extra year, so 40 /1 = 40 per year for that extra year. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is for the existing tires, which are already four years old. So without repair, they would last one more year, making the total lifespan four years. But with repair, they last five years. So the total cost for the tires is the initial cost when they were purchased, plus $40 for repair.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't mention the initial cost of the current tires. So perhaps the problem is considering the cost of the repair as an additional $40 per tire, which allows the tire to last for one more year. So if the customer chooses to repair, they pay $40, and the tire lasts for one more year than it would have otherwise. But without knowing the initial cost of the current tires, perhaps the problem is considering the average cost per year for the repair option as $40 per year for the additional year.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently.\n\nThe question is asking for the average cost per year of the new tires compared to the cost of repairing. So perhaps we should calculate the average cost per year for each option and then find the percentage increase.\n\nFor new tires: $180 /4 years = $45 per year.\n\nFor repair: the customer pays $40 for an extra year. So the average cost per year for that extra year is $40, but that's only for one year. So maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, maybe the repair is done each year? No, the problem says the repair makes the tires last for one additional year. So the repair is a one-time cost of $40 per tire, which adds one year to their lifespan.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are four years old and are about to fail. So without repair, they would last one more year (total four years), and with repair, they last five years. So the cost of repair is $40, and the tire lasts five years. So the average cost per year for the repair option is (cost of initial purchase + repair cost) divided by total lifespan. But wait, the problem doesn't mention the initial cost of the current tires, so perhaps the repair is the only cost considered here. Or perhaps the problem is only considering the repair cost and the additional year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is comparing the two options on a per-year basis, regardless of the initial cost. So for the repair option, the customer pays $40 for one additional year. So the average cost per year for the repair is $40 for that one year. But that would make the average cost per year for the repair $40, and for the new tires, it's $45. So the new tires are more expensive, but the question is about how much more in percentage terms.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the new tires last four years. So perhaps I'm not considering the correct average.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model both options for the same number of years. Let's say the customer is looking to get tires that will last for four years.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Cost $180, last four years. Average cost per year: 180 /4 = 45.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires. Each repair costs $40 and adds one year. So to get four years of use, how many repairs would be needed?\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me think: If the customer repairs their current tires, each repair adds one year. So to get four years of use, they would need to do this four times? No, that doesn't make sense because each repair adds a year beyond the previous lifespan. Wait, perhaps each repair extends the life by one year, but each time, the tire is getting older and needs another repair. But that's probably not the case. Alternatively, perhaps each repair extends the life by one year, but the customer can only do this once because after the first repair, the tire is already at maximum lifespan.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is assuming that the current tires are four years old and about to fail, so the customer can repair them once for $40, making them last one more year (total five years). But if the customer wants four years of use, perhaps they don't need to repair. Alternatively, perhaps the customer is considering whether to buy new tires or repair the current ones to get four more years.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it in terms of the average cost per year for each option.\n\nFor the new tires: 4 years, $180. So 180/4 = 45 per year.\n\nFor the repair: the customer pays $40 for an extra year. So if the current tires are about to last one more year without repair, with repair, they last two more years. Or perhaps the repair makes them last one more year beyond their current lifespan, which is four years. So the total lifespan becomes five years, and the cost is $40. So the average cost per year would be 40 /5 = 8 per year.\n\nWait, but that seems way too low. Because the customer is getting an extra year for $40, so the cost per additional year is $40, but the average cost would depend on the total lifespan.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the current tires can be repaired for $40, making them last one additional year beyond their original lifespan. So the original lifespan is four years; with repair, it's five. So the total cost is $40 for five years, so 40/5 = 8 per year.\n\nSo now comparing the two options:\n\nNew tires: 45 per year.\n\nRepair: 8 per year.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 8 is way less than 45. The question is asking by what percentage the new tires' average cost is greater than the repair. So the calculation would be (45 -8)/8 * 100% = (37)/8 *100% = 462.5%. But that's not one of the options. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, maybe I'm not considering that the repair is per tire, and the customer might have a set number of tires. Let's think: Suppose the customer has four tires. So the cost for new tires is 4 * 180 = 720. The repair option is 4 *40 = 160, which adds one year to each tire's life. So if the new tires last four years, the repaired tires would last five years. So the average cost per year for the new tires is 720 /4 = 180 per year. For the repair, it's 160 /5 = 32 per year.\n\nWait, that can't be right either because 180 compared to 32 would give a huge percentage. But the options don't have that. So I'm definitely misunderstanding something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering each tire individually. So for one tire, new cost is 180, lasts four years. Average cost per year is 45.\n\nRepair: 40, extends lifespan by one year, so the tire now lasts five years. So the average cost per year is 40 /5 = 8.\n\nSo the new tire's average cost is 45, repair is 8. The question is, what percent greater is 45 than 8.\n\nSo the increase is 45 -8 =37. So 37 is what percent of 8? (37/8)*100 =462.5%. But that's not an option. So I must be making a wrong assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair is done each year. No, the problem says the repair makes the tires last one additional year. So perhaps the repair is a one-time cost, and the tire lasts one more year beyond its original lifespan. So if a tire is four years old, repair makes it last five. So the average cost per year for that tire is 40 /5 =8.\n\nBut that's way too low, and the options don't match. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering the cost of the repair per tire, but the customer has multiple tires. Let's think of the customer having four tires. So for new tires, cost is 4 *180 = 720 for four years. Average cost per year: 720 /4= 180.\n\nRepair: 4 tires, each repaired for 40, so 160 total. This repair makes each tire last one more year. So the original lifespan is four years; with repair, it's five. So the total lifespan is five years. So the average cost per year would be 160 /5 =32.\n\nSo the new option is 180, repair is 32. The percentage increase is (180-32)/32 = 148/32=4.625, which is 462.5% increase. But none of the options match. So clearly, I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nAlternative approach: Perhaps the customer is considering replacing the tires when they are about to fail. So the current tires are four years old and about to fail. The repair would make them last one more year, so five years in total. So the cost for the repair is $40 per tire. So for four tires, the repair cost is 160. So the average cost per year for the repair is 160 /5 =32 per year.\n\nThe new tires cost 720 for four years, average 180 per year.\n\nSo the increase is (180 -32)/32 = 148/32 =4.625 \u2192 462.5% increase. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem is considering only the cost of repair per tire, not all four.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is per tire. So for one tire: new cost 180, lasts four years. Average 45 per year.\n\nRepair: 40, adds one year, so tire lasts five years. So average cost per year is 40 /5 =8.\n\nSo 45 is how much percent greater than 8. So (45-8)/8 *100 = (37/8)*100=462.5%. Not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering that the repair is done each year. No, the problem says repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So it's a one-time repair.\n\nAlternative thought: Maybe the repair cost is per additional year, not per tire. So if the customer wants to get another year of use, they pay $40 per tire. So for each year they want beyond the original four, they pay $40 per tire.\n\nBut the problem states that the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So the repair is a one-time cost of $40 per tire, giving an extra year.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is comparing the average cost per year when you have four tires. Let me think of it as a system.\n\nOption 1: Buy four new tires for 4 *180 =720. They last four years. So average cost per year is 720 /4 = 180.\n\nOption 2: Repair the four current tires for 4 *40=160. The tires last one additional year, so total lifespan is five years. So average cost per year is 160 /5 =32.\n\nSo the new tires are 180, repair is 32. So the new tires are (180-32)/32 *100 = 148/32=4.625 \u2192 462.5% higher. But that's not an option. So I must be making a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem isn't considering the entire lifespan but the cost per year of the current tire.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are about to fail, so without repair, they would last one more year. Repair makes them last two more years. Or maybe the problem is that the current tires have some life left, and repair adds one more year beyond that. So the repair cost is $40, and the tire lasts for one additional year beyond its current lifespan.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering that the current tires have already been in use for some time, and the repair extends their life by one year beyond their current lifespan. But without knowing how much time they've already been in use, perhaps the problem is simplifying.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as: The cost per year for the new tires is 180/4=45. For the repair, the customer pays 40 and gets one additional year. So the average cost per year for that extra year is 40/1=40. So the new tires cost 45 per year, repair is 40 for that extra year. So the new tires are 45 vs repair's 40.\n\nWait, but the problem is comparing the average cost per year of the new tires to the repair. So perhaps the question is, what is the average cost per year for the new tires compared to the cost of repairing to get an additional year.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So the customer's current tires can be repaired to last one more year. So perhaps the average cost per year for the repair is 40 per year (since it's for one year). The new tires have an average cost of 45 per year over four years.\n\nSo the question is, 45 is what percent greater than 40? Because the repair gives one more year, but the new tires are used for four years.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the new tires are used for four years, and the repair is used for one more year beyond the current lifespan.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer is comparing the cost of the new tires (which last four years) versus the cost of repairing their current tires (which would allow them to last one more year, making it five years in total). So the average cost per year for the new tires is 45, and for the repair, it's 40/5=8. But that doesn't make sense because 45 is way higher than 8, but the options don't include that.\n\nI think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach.\n\nThe question asks for the average cost per year of the new tires compared to the repair. So, perhaps the customer is deciding whether to buy new tires (cost 180, last 4 years) or repair the current ones (cost 40, last 1 additional year). So for the same number of years, say four years, the new tires cost 180, and the repair would need to be done once to get that extra year. Wait, no, if the current tires are four years old, and the customer repairs them for 40, they last five years. So for four years, the customer would not need to repair, because the new tires last four years. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the customer's current tires are about to last one more year, so without repair, they can use them for one more year. If they repair, they can use them for two more years. So the repair cost is 40, which allows them to have two years instead of one. So the average cost per year for the repair is 40/2=20. But the new tires cost 180 for four years, so 45 per year.\n\nSo the new tires' cost per year is 45, repair is 20 per year. So the increase is (45-20)/20 *100 = 125%. But that's not one of the options either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is done each year to extend the life by one year each time. But that's not what the problem states. The problem says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering that the customer has four tires, each costing 40 to repair, giving each an extra year. So for four tires, the repair cost is 160, and they last one more year, making their lifespan five years. So the average cost per year is 160 /5 =32. The new tires cost 720 for four years, average 180 per year. So the percentage increase is (180-32)/32 *100=462.5%, which is not an option.\n\nI'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look at the options given. The options are 8%,10%,12.5%,16.7%,25%.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in considering the average cost per year for the repair. Let me think: For the new tires, average is 45 per year. For the repair, the customer pays 40 for one additional year. So the average cost per year for that one year is 40. So the new tires cost 45 per year, which is 5 more than 40. So the percentage increase is (5/40)*100=12.5%.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the new tires' average cost per year is 45, repair is 40 for one year. So 45 is 5 more than 40, which is 12.5% increase.\n\nWait, but that doesn't account for the total lifespan. Because the new tires are for four years, and the repair is for one additional year. So perhaps the question is comparing the average cost per year for the new tires to the repair cost per year.\n\nWait, the question says: \"the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\"\n\nAh, so it's comparing the average cost per year of the new tires (45) to the average cost per year of the repair option (40). Because the repair gives an additional year, but the question is about the average cost per year of each option. So for the repair, the average cost per year is 40 for that one additional year. So the new tires' average is 45, repair is 40. So the increase is (45-40)/40 *100 = (5/40)*100=12.5%.\n\nThat's option C.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the percentage by which the average cost per year of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires, we analyze both options:\n\n### New Tires:\n- **Cost**: $180 per tire.\n- **Lifespan**: 4 years.\n- **Average Cost per Year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\$180}{4} = \\$45 \\text{ per year}.\n  \\]\n\n### Repair Option:\n- **Cost**: $40 per tire.\n- **Additional Lifespan**: 1 year.\n- **Average Cost per Year**:  \n  Since the repair extends the tire's life by 1 year, the cost of $40 is spread over this additional year:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\$40}{1} = \\$40 \\text{ per year}.\n  \\]\n\n### Percentage Increase:\nThe question asks by what percentage the average cost per year of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about tires, and I need to figure out the percentage difference in cost per year between buying new tires and repairing the current ones. Hmm, let me break it down.\n\nSo, the problem says that new tires from a certain brand last for four years and cost $180 each. Alternatively, the customer can repair their current tires for $40 each, which adds one more year to their life. The question is asking what percent greater the average cost per year is for the new tires compared to repairing.\n\nWait, I think I should calculate the average cost per year for both options and then find out the percentage difference. Let me start with the new tires.\n\nFor the new tires: Each tire costs $180 and lasts four years. So the average cost per year would be the total cost divided by the number of years. So that's $180 divided by 4. Let me do that calculation: 180 / 4 = 45. So each year, the new tire costs $45 on average.\n\nNow, the repair option: The customer can repair their current tires for $40 each, which adds one year. So, how long do the tires last after repair? The original lifespan is four years, and repair adds one year, making it five years total. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh, wait, the question says the new tires last four years when purchased new. The customer's current tires are presumably older. So when they repair them, the current tires will last one additional year. So if the current tires were already, say, three years old, repairing them would make them last one more year, so total four years from the time of repair. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem states that the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So the total lifespan becomes the original plus one year. But how long were they used before?\n\nWait, perhaps the initial situation is that the customer's current tires are at the end of their life. So if the new tires last four years, the current ones are at year four. If you repair them, they last one more year, so five years in total. Wait, no, perhaps the current tires were already, say, x years old, but perhaps the problem is considering that the current tires are about to fail, so the repair gives them an extra year beyond what they already have. Or perhaps the repair adds one year to their life, regardless of current age. Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering that the current tires are in their fourth year, and repairing them adds one more year, making them last for five years. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the repair adds one year to the tire's life, regardless of how old they are. So, if the tires were new and you repair them, they'd last five years. But that's not the case here, because the customer is considering whether to buy new tires or repair the current ones.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated. Let's think: the customer has current tires. If they repair them, they can get one more year of use. So the current tires would last for their original lifespan plus one year. But what's the original lifespan? The problem says that new tires last four years. So the current tires, if they're new, would last four years, but if they're repaired, they'll last five years. But wait, no, the customer might not have new tires; perhaps the current tires are already a few years old. But the problem doesn't specify how old the current tires are. So maybe the assumption is that the current tires are already four years old and are about to fail. So repairing them would make them last one more year, so they would last for a total of four years (the original lifespan) plus one, making five years. Wait, but that's getting confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the repair allows the current tires to last one more year than they would without the repair. So if the current tires would normally last, say, n years, they'd last n+1 after repair. But the problem says that when you buy new tires, they last four years. So the current tires are likely at the end of their four years. So if the customer repairs them, they can get one more year, making the total lifespan five years.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the current tires are already four years old and are about to fail. So if the customer repairs them, they get one more year, making the lifespan of the current tires five years in total. But that's from the time they were new. So the cost for the repair is $40 per tire, and they get an extra year. So the average cost per year for the repair option would be total cost divided by the total years.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I'm interpreting it correctly. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe customer can choose to purchase new tires at $180 each, which last four years. Or repair current tires at $40 each, which makes them last one additional year.\n\nAh, so the repair gives an extra year beyond their current lifespan. So, for example, if the current tires were about to fail after, say, 3 years, the repair would make them last 4 years. Or perhaps the current tires have some life left, and the repair adds one more year.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires have already been used for some time. But without knowing how long, perhaps the problem assumes that the current tires are at the point where they need to be replaced, so without repair, they would last one more year. Wait, no, the problem says that the new tires last four years. So the current tires, when new, would last four years. So when the customer is thinking of repairing, perhaps the current tires are four years old and about to fail, so the repair makes them last one more year, giving a total of five years from when they were new.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the problem is simpler. Let's think in terms of cost per year.\n\nFor new tires: $180 per tire, lasts four years. So average cost per year is 180 /4 = $45 per year.\n\nFor repair: $40 per tire, and the tires last one additional year. So the total lifespan becomes four +1 = five years? Or wait, no. If the current tires are already four years old, and repair makes them last one more year, then the total lifespan is five years. But wait, that would mean the repair is adding one year beyond the original four. So the cost is $40 for that one additional year. So the average cost per year would be the total cost divided by the total years.\n\nWait, but how much has the customer already spent on the current tires? The problem doesn't say. So perhaps the problem is considering the repair as an option to extend the current tires' life by one year beyond their original four. So, the current tires would last five years total if repaired, and the customer would pay $40 for that extra year.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the cost per year for the repair would be $40 spread over the five years? Or is the repair cost per tire, and the tire lasts one additional year beyond its original lifespan.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the current tires are about to fail after four years, and the repair allows them to last for one more year, so the total lifespan is five years. So the customer pays $40 to get that fifth year.\n\nWait, but how does this affect the average cost per year? Let me think.\n\nIf the customer buys new tires: cost is $180, lasts four years. So average cost is 45 per year.\n\nIf the customer repairs: pays $40, and the tires last for one more year. So total lifespan is five years. So the total cost is $40, spread over five years. So average cost per year is 40 /5 = $8 per year.\n\nWait, that seems too low. Because if the customer's current tires were already four years old and about to fail, the repair would add one more year, making the total lifespan five years. So the cost is $40 for that extra year, so 40 /1 = 40 per year for that extra year. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is for the existing tires, which are already four years old. So without repair, they would last one more year, making the total lifespan four years. But with repair, they last five years. So the total cost for the tires is the initial cost when they were purchased, plus $40 for repair.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't mention the initial cost of the current tires. So perhaps the problem is considering the cost of the repair as an additional $40 per tire, which allows the tire to last for one more year. So if the customer chooses to repair, they pay $40, and the tire lasts for one more year than it would have otherwise. But without knowing the initial cost of the current tires, perhaps the problem is considering the average cost per year for the repair option as $40 per year for the additional year.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently.\n\nThe question is asking for the average cost per year of the new tires compared to the cost of repairing. So perhaps we should calculate the average cost per year for each option and then find the percentage increase.\n\nFor new tires: $180 /4 years = $45 per year.\n\nFor repair: the customer pays $40 for an extra year. So the average cost per year for that extra year is $40, but that's only for one year. So maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, maybe the repair is done each year? No, the problem says the repair makes the tires last for one additional year. So the repair is a one-time cost of $40 per tire, which adds one year to their lifespan.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are four years old and are about to fail. So without repair, they would last one more year (total four years), and with repair, they last five years. So the cost of repair is $40, and the tire lasts five years. So the average cost per year for the repair option is (cost of initial purchase + repair cost) divided by total lifespan. But wait, the problem doesn't mention the initial cost of the current tires, so perhaps the repair is the only cost considered here. Or perhaps the problem is only considering the repair cost and the additional year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is comparing the two options on a per-year basis, regardless of the initial cost. So for the repair option, the customer pays $40 for one additional year. So the average cost per year for the repair is $40 for that one year. But that would make the average cost per year for the repair $40, and for the new tires, it's $45. So the new tires are more expensive, but the question is about how much more in percentage terms.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the new tires last four years. So perhaps I'm not considering the correct average.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model both options for the same number of years. Let's say the customer is looking to get tires that will last for four years.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Cost $180, last four years. Average cost per year: 180 /4 = 45.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires. Each repair costs $40 and adds one year. So to get four years of use, how many repairs would be needed?\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me think: If the customer repairs their current tires, each repair adds one year. So to get four years of use, they would need to do this four times? No, that doesn't make sense because each repair adds a year beyond the previous lifespan. Wait, perhaps each repair extends the life by one year, but each time, the tire is getting older and needs another repair. But that's probably not the case. Alternatively, perhaps each repair extends the life by one year, but the customer can only do this once because after the first repair, the tire is already at maximum lifespan.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is assuming that the current tires are four years old and about to fail, so the customer can repair them once for $40, making them last one more year (total five years). But if the customer wants four years of use, perhaps they don't need to repair. Alternatively, perhaps the customer is considering whether to buy new tires or repair the current ones to get four more years.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it in terms of the average cost per year for each option.\n\nFor the new tires: 4 years, $180. So 180/4 = 45 per year.\n\nFor the repair: the customer pays $40 for an extra year. So if the current tires are about to last one more year without repair, with repair, they last two more years. Or perhaps the repair makes them last one more year beyond their current lifespan, which is four years. So the total lifespan becomes five years, and the cost is $40. So the average cost per year would be 40 /5 = 8 per year.\n\nWait, but that seems way too low. Because the customer is getting an extra year for $40, so the cost per additional year is $40, but the average cost would depend on the total lifespan.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the current tires can be repaired for $40, making them last one additional year beyond their original lifespan. So the original lifespan is four years; with repair, it's five. So the total cost is $40 for five years, so 40/5 = 8 per year.\n\nSo now comparing the two options:\n\nNew tires: 45 per year.\n\nRepair: 8 per year.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 8 is way less than 45. The question is asking by what percentage the new tires' average cost is greater than the repair. So the calculation would be (45 -8)/8 * 100% = (37)/8 *100% = 462.5%. But that's not one of the options. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, maybe I'm not considering that the repair is per tire, and the customer might have a set number of tires. Let's think: Suppose the customer has four tires. So the cost for new tires is 4 * 180 = 720. The repair option is 4 *40 = 160, which adds one year to each tire's life. So if the new tires last four years, the repaired tires would last five years. So the average cost per year for the new tires is 720 /4 = 180 per year. For the repair, it's 160 /5 = 32 per year.\n\nWait, that can't be right either because 180 compared to 32 would give a huge percentage. But the options don't have that. So I'm definitely misunderstanding something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering each tire individually. So for one tire, new cost is 180, lasts four years. Average cost per year is 45.\n\nRepair: 40, extends lifespan by one year, so the tire now lasts five years. So the average cost per year is 40 /5 = 8.\n\nSo the new tire's average cost is 45, repair is 8. The question is, what percent greater is 45 than 8.\n\nSo the increase is 45 -8 =37. So 37 is what percent of 8? (37/8)*100 =462.5%. But that's not an option. So I must be making a wrong assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair is done each year. No, the problem says the repair makes the tires last one additional year. So perhaps the repair is a one-time cost, and the tire lasts one more year beyond its original lifespan. So if a tire is four years old, repair makes it last five. So the average cost per year for that tire is 40 /5 =8.\n\nBut that's way too low, and the options don't match. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering the cost of the repair per tire, but the customer has multiple tires. Let's think of the customer having four tires. So for new tires, cost is 4 *180 = 720 for four years. Average cost per year: 720 /4= 180.\n\nRepair: 4 tires, each repaired for 40, so 160 total. This repair makes each tire last one more year. So the original lifespan is four years; with repair, it's five. So the total lifespan is five years. So the average cost per year would be 160 /5 =32.\n\nSo the new option is 180, repair is 32. The percentage increase is (180-32)/32 = 148/32=4.625, which is 462.5% increase. But none of the options match. So clearly, I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nAlternative approach: Perhaps the customer is considering replacing the tires when they are about to fail. So the current tires are four years old and about to fail. The repair would make them last one more year, so five years in total. So the cost for the repair is $40 per tire. So for four tires, the repair cost is 160. So the average cost per year for the repair is 160 /5 =32 per year.\n\nThe new tires cost 720 for four years, average 180 per year.\n\nSo the increase is (180 -32)/32 = 148/32 =4.625 \u2192 462.5% increase. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem is considering only the cost of repair per tire, not all four.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is per tire. So for one tire: new cost 180, lasts four years. Average 45 per year.\n\nRepair: 40, adds one year, so tire lasts five years. So average cost per year is 40 /5 =8.\n\nSo 45 is how much percent greater than 8. So (45-8)/8 *100 = (37/8)*100=462.5%. Not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering that the repair is done each year. No, the problem says repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So it's a one-time repair.\n\nAlternative thought: Maybe the repair cost is per additional year, not per tire. So if the customer wants to get another year of use, they pay $40 per tire. So for each year they want beyond the original four, they pay $40 per tire.\n\nBut the problem states that the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So the repair is a one-time cost of $40 per tire, giving an extra year.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is comparing the average cost per year when you have four tires. Let me think of it as a system.\n\nOption 1: Buy four new tires for 4 *180 =720. They last four years. So average cost per year is 720 /4 = 180.\n\nOption 2: Repair the four current tires for 4 *40=160. The tires last one additional year, so total lifespan is five years. So average cost per year is 160 /5 =32.\n\nSo the new tires are 180, repair is 32. So the new tires are (180-32)/32 *100 = 148/32=4.625 \u2192 462.5% higher. But that's not an option. So I must be making a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem isn't considering the entire lifespan but the cost per year of the current tire.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are about to fail, so without repair, they would last one more year. Repair makes them last two more years. Or maybe the problem is that the current tires have some life left, and repair adds one more year beyond that. So the repair cost is $40, and the tire lasts for one additional year beyond its current lifespan.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering that the current tires have already been in use for some time, and the repair extends their life by one year beyond their current lifespan. But without knowing how much time they've already been in use, perhaps the problem is simplifying.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as: The cost per year for the new tires is 180/4=45. For the repair, the customer pays 40 and gets one additional year. So the average cost per year for that extra year is 40/1=40. So the new tires cost 45 per year, repair is 40 for that extra year. So the new tires are 45 vs repair's 40.\n\nWait, but the problem is comparing the average cost per year of the new tires to the repair. So perhaps the question is, what is the average cost per year for the new tires compared to the cost of repairing to get an additional year.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So the customer's current tires can be repaired to last one more year. So perhaps the average cost per year for the repair is 40 per year (since it's for one year). The new tires have an average cost of 45 per year over four years.\n\nSo the question is, 45 is what percent greater than 40? Because the repair gives one more year, but the new tires are used for four years.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the new tires are used for four years, and the repair is used for one more year beyond the current lifespan.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer is comparing the cost of the new tires (which last four years) versus the cost of repairing their current tires (which would allow them to last one more year, making it five years in total). So the average cost per year for the new tires is 45, and for the repair, it's 40/5=8. But that doesn't make sense because 45 is way higher than 8, but the options don't include that.\n\nI think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach.\n\nThe question asks for the average cost per year of the new tires compared to the repair. So, perhaps the customer is deciding whether to buy new tires (cost 180, last 4 years) or repair the current ones (cost 40, last 1 additional year). So for the same number of years, say four years, the new tires cost 180, and the repair would need to be done once to get that extra year. Wait, no, if the current tires are four years old, and the customer repairs them for 40, they last five years. So for four years, the customer would not need to repair, because the new tires last four years. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the customer's current tires are about to last one more year, so without repair, they can use them for one more year. If they repair, they can use them for two more years. So the repair cost is 40, which allows them to have two years instead of one. So the average cost per year for the repair is 40/2=20. But the new tires cost 180 for four years, so 45 per year.\n\nSo the new tires' cost per year is 45, repair is 20 per year. So the increase is (45-20)/20 *100 = 125%. But that's not one of the options either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is done each year to extend the life by one year each time. But that's not what the problem states. The problem says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering that the customer has four tires, each costing 40 to repair, giving each an extra year. So for four tires, the repair cost is 160, and they last one more year, making their lifespan five years. So the average cost per year is 160 /5 =32. The new tires cost 720 for four years, average 180 per year. So the percentage increase is (180-32)/32 *100=462.5%, which is not an option.\n\nI'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look at the options given. The options are 8%,10%,12.5%,16.7%,25%.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in considering the average cost per year for the repair. Let me think: For the new tires, average is 45 per year. For the repair, the customer pays 40 for one additional year. So the average cost per year for that one year is 40. So the new tires cost 45 per year, which is 5 more than 40. So the percentage increase is (5/40)*100=12.5%.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the new tires' average cost per year is 45, repair is 40 for one year. So 45 is 5 more than 40, which is 12.5% increase.\n\nWait, but that doesn't account for the total lifespan. Because the new tires are for four years, and the repair is for one additional year. So perhaps the question is comparing the average cost per year for the new tires to the repair cost per year.\n\nWait, the question says: \"the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\"\n\nAh, so it's comparing the average cost per year of the new tires (45) to the average cost per year of the repair option (40). Because the repair gives an additional year, but the question is about the average cost per year of each option. So for the repair, the average cost per year is 40 for that one additional year. So the new tires' average is 45, repair is 40. So the increase is (45-40)/40 *100 = (5/40)*100=12.5%.\n\nThat's option C.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage by which the average cost per year of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires, we analyze both options:\n\n### New Tires:\n- **Cost**: $180 per tire.\n- **Lifespan**: 4 years.\n- **Average Cost per Year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\$180}{4} = \\$45 \\text{ per year}.\n  \\]\n\n### Repair Option:\n- **Cost**: $40 per tire.\n- **Additional Lifespan**: 1 year.\n- **Average Cost per Year**:  \n  Since the repair extends the tire's life by 1 year, the cost of $40 is spread over this additional year:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\$40}{1} = \\$40 \\text{ per year}.\n  \\]\n\n### Percentage Increase:\nThe question asks by what percentage the average cost per year of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing. The difference in average cost per year is:  \n\\[\n\\$45 - \\$40 = \\$5.\n\\]  \nThe percentage increase is calculated as:  \n\\[\n\\frac{\\$5}{\\$40} \\times 100\\% = 12.5\\%.\n\\]\n\nThus, the average cost per year of new tires is **12.5% greater** than the cost of repairing the current tires.\n\nAnswer: C",
