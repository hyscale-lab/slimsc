      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where a father is dividing Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan. Mohan is 23, and Sohan is 24 right now. The goal is to split the money such that when each son invests their share at a 4% compound interest rate, they'll have equal amounts when they both turn 26. Hmm, I need to find out how much Mohan gets.\n\nWait, let me think. So the father is dividing the amount between the two sons. The total is 5100, so whatever shares they get, their sum should be 5100. The key point is that their future amounts, when invested at 4% compound interest, should be equal when they are 26.\n\nLet me break it down. Right now, Mohan is 23, so he'll turn 26 in 3 years. Sohan is 24, so he'll turn 26 in 2 years. Each son's investment will grow for a different number of years, but they need to end up with the same amount.\n\nLet's denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's share as S. So, M + S = 5100.\n\nThe compound interest formula is A = P*(1 + r)^t, where A is the amount, P principal, r rate, t time in years. So for Mohan, his amount after 3 years will be M*(1 + 0.04)^3. For Sohan, it'll be S*(1 + 0.04)^2. And these two should be equal.\n\nSo the equation is M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2.\n\nI can rearrange this equation to find the ratio of M to S. Let me write it as M/S = (1.04)^2 / (1.04)^3. Wait, that's M/S = 1/(1.04). Because (1.04)^3 is (1.04)^2 * 1.04, so when you divide (1.04)^2 by (1.04)^3, you get 1/(1.04).\n\nSo M/S = 1/(1.04). Which is approximately 0.9615. So M = S * (1 / 1.04) \u2248 S * 0.9615.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should express it as M = S * (1.04)^{-1}.\n\nBut since M + S = 5100, I can substitute M in terms of S. Let me do that.\n\nFrom the ratio, M = S / 1.04.\n\nSo substituting into M + S = 5100:\n\nS/1.04 + S = 5100.\n\nLet me compute S/1.04 + S.\n\nCombine the terms: S (1/1.04 + 1) = 5100.\n\nCompute 1/1.04: that's approximately 0.9615. So 0.9615 + 1 = 1.9615.\n\nSo S * 1.9615 \u2248 5100.\n\nSo S \u2248 5100 / 1.9615. Let me compute that. Hmm, 5100 divided by approximately 1.9615.\n\nLet me compute 5100 / 1.9615. Let's see, 1.9615 is approximately 2, so 5100 / 2 is 2550. But since 1.9615 is slightly less than 2, the result will be a bit higher than 2550.\n\nWait, let me calculate this more accurately. 1.9615 is 1.04*1.9615 = 2. So 5100 divided by 1.9615.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it as 5100 * (100/104) because 1.04 is 104/100. So 1/1.04 is 100/104.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. The equation is S * (1 + 1/1.04) = 5100.\n\nWait, 1/1.04 is approximately 0.9615, so 1 + 0.9615 is 1.9615.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me express M and S in terms of the ratio. Since M/S = 1/(1.04), the ratio M:S is 1:1.04. So the total parts are 1 + 1.04 = 2.04 parts. So each part is 5100 / 2.04.\n\nWait, that's a better way. Let's see.\n\nSo M:S = 1 : 1.04. So the sum of the ratio is 1 + 1.04 = 2.04.\n\nSo each part is 5100 / 2.04.\n\nCalculating 5100 divided by 2.04.\n\nLet me compute 5100 \u00f7 2.04.\n\nFirst, 2.04 multiplied by 2500 is 5100, because 2.04 * 2500 = (2 * 2500) + (0.04 * 2500) = 5000 + 100 = 5100. Oh! So 2.04 * 2500 = 5100. So each part is 2500.\n\nWait, but wait, the ratio is M:S = 1:1.04. So M is 1 part, S is 1.04 parts.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 1 part is 2500, so M would be 2500 and S would be 2500 * 1.04 = 2600. But 2500 + 2600 = 5100, which matches.\n\nSo, M is 2500, S is 2600. But wait, the question asks for Mohan's share. So the answer should be 2500.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check because I'm a bit confused. So M is 2500, and S is 2600. Let's see if when invested, they give the same amount.\n\nMohan's investment: 2500 for 3 years at 4% per annum.\n\nSo, 2500 * (1.04)^3.\n\n(1.04)^3 is approximately 1.124864.\n\nSo 2500 * 1.124864 = 2500 * 1.124864.\n\nLet me calculate: 2500 * 1.124864 = 2812.16.\n\nSohan's investment: 2600 for 2 years at 4% per annum.\n\n2600 * (1.04)^2.\n\n(1.04)^2 is 1.0816.\n\n2600 * 1.0816 = 2812.16.\n\nYes, that's the same. So that works out.\n\nSo Mohan's share is 2500, which is option B.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is 2500, which is correct. So the answer is B.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a father dividing Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan. Mohan is 23 and Sohan is 24 now. The father wants to split the money such that when their shares are invested at 4% compound interest, they'll have equal amounts when they turn 26. I need to find Mohan's share.\n\nHmm, let's think. So, both sons are going to receive their shares now, and these shares will be invested. The goal is for both to have the same amount when they're 26. Since Sohan is older, he'll reach 26 sooner than Mohan. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, Mohan is 23, so in 3 years he'll be 26. Sohan is 24, so in 2 years he'll be 26. So Sohan's investment will have less time to grow.\n\nSo, the idea is that the amount each son gets now, when compounded, should be equal when they turn 26. That means Sohan's share will be invested for 2 years, and Mohan's share will be invested for 3 years. Because Sohan is older, his investment period is shorter.\n\nLet me denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's share as S. The total is M + S = 5100.\n\nThe problem is about the future value of their investments. Since it's compound interest, the formula is A = P*(1 + r)^t, where A is the amount, P is principal, r is rate, and t is time.\n\nSo for Sohan, his investment S will be compounded for 2 years. So his future amount is S*(1 + 0.04)^2.\n\nFor Mohan, his investment M will be compounded for 3 years. His future amount is M*(1 + 0.04)^3.\n\nThese two future amounts should be equal. So:\n\nS*(1.04)^2 = M*(1.04)^3\n\nWait, but since M + S = 5100, I can express S in terms of M: S = 5100 - M.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\n(5100 - M)*(1.04)^2 = M*(1.04)^3\n\nLet me calculate the powers of 1.04. Let's see:\n\n1.04 squared is 1.0816.\n\n1.04 cubed is 1.124864.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n(5100 - M) * 1.0816 = M * 1.124864\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\n5100 * 1.0816 - M * 1.0816 = M * 1.124864\n\nLet me compute 5100 * 1.0816. Let me calculate 5000 * 1.0816 = 5408, and 100 * 1.0816 = 108.16. So total is 5408 + 108.16 = 5516.16.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n5516.16 - 1.0816 M = 1.124864 M\n\nNow, I'll collect like terms. Bring the M terms to one side.\n\n5516.16 = 1.124864 M + 1.0816 M\n\nAdding those coefficients: 1.124864 + 1.0816 = 2.206464\n\nSo 5516.16 = 2.206464 M\n\nTherefore, M = 5516.16 / 2.206464\n\nLet me compute that. Let's see, 5516.16 divided by 2.206464.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can approximate this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write it as:\n\nM = 5516.16 / (1.04 * 1.0816 + 1.0816) ?\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me just compute the division.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor out 1.04^2 from both sides.\n\nWait, another approach: let's write the initial equation again.\n\n(5100 - M) * (1.04)^2 = M * (1.04)^3\n\nDivide both sides by (1.04)^2:\n\n5100 - M = M * 1.04\n\nBecause (1.04)^3 divided by (1.04)^2 is 1.04.\n\nSo 5100 - M = 1.04 M\n\nThen, 5100 = 1.04 M + M = M (1 + 1.04) = M * 2.04\n\nSo M = 5100 / 2.04\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n5100 divided by 2.04.\n\nWell, 2.04 times 2500 is 5100, because 2.04 * 2500 = 5100.\n\nWait, 2.04 * 2500 = (2 * 2500) + (0.04 * 2500) = 5000 + 100 = 5100.\n\nYes! So M is 2500.\n\nWait, but wait, that would mean Sohan's share is 5100 - 2500 = 2600.\n\nLet me check the math again to make sure.\n\nSo, the equation after dividing by (1.04)^2:\n\n5100 - M = M * 1.04\n\nSo, 5100 = M + 1.04 M = 2.04 M\n\nM = 5100 / 2.04 = 2500.\n\nYes. So Mohan's share is 2500, which is option B.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm that the future values are equal.\n\nMohan's share is 2500, invested for 3 years at 4%: 2500*(1.04)^3.\n\nSohan's share is 2600, invested for 2 years: 2600*(1.04)^2.\n\nCompute both:\n\n(1.04)^2 = 1.0816. 2600 * 1.0816 = 2600 * 1.0816. Let me compute 2600 *1 = 2600, 2600 * 0.0816 = 2600 * 0.08 = 208, 2600 * 0.0016 =4.16. So 208 +4.16=212.16. So 2600+212.16=2812.16.\n\nMohan's: 2500*(1.04)^3. 1.04^3 is approximately 1.124864. So 2500 *1.124864 = 2812.16.\n\nYes, they are equal. So the calculation is correct.\n\nSo the answer is B) 2500.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a father dividing Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan. Mohan is 23 and Sohan is 24 now. The father wants to split the money such that when their shares are invested at 4% compound interest, they'll have equal amounts when they turn 26. I need to find Mohan's share.\n\nHmm, let's think. So, both sons are going to receive their shares now, and these shares will be invested. The goal is for both to have the same amount when they're 26. Since Sohan is older, he'll reach 26 sooner than Mohan. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, Mohan is 23, so in 3 years he'll be 26. Sohan is 24, so in 2 years he'll be 26. So Sohan's investment will have less time to grow.\n\nSo, the idea is that the amount each son gets now, when compounded, should be equal when they turn 26. That means Sohan's share will be invested for 2 years, and Mohan's share will be invested for 3 years. Because Sohan is older, his investment period is shorter.\n\nLet me denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's share as S. The total is M + S = 5100.\n\nThe problem is about the future value of their investments. Since it's compound interest, the formula is A = P*(1 + r)^t, where A is the amount, P is principal, r is rate, and t is time.\n\nSo for Sohan, his investment S will be compounded for 2 years. So his future amount is S*(1 + 0.04)^2.\n\nFor Mohan, his investment M will be compounded for 3 years. His future amount is M*(1 + 0.04)^3.\n\nThese two future amounts should be equal. So:\n\nS*(1.04)^2 = M*(1.04)^3\n\nWait, but since M + S = 5100, I can express S in terms of M: S = 5100 - M.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\n(5100 - M)*(1.04)^2 = M*(1.04)^3\n\nLet me calculate the powers of 1.04. Let's see:\n\n1.04 squared is 1.0816.\n\n1.04 cubed is 1.124864.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n(5100 - M) * 1.0816 = M * 1.124864\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\n5100 * 1.0816 - M * 1.0816 = M * 1.124864\n\nLet me compute 5100 * 1.0816. Let me calculate 5000 * 1.0816 = 5408, and 100 * 1.0816 = 108.16. So total is 5408 + 108.16 = 5516.16.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n5516.16 - 1.0816 M = 1.124864 M\n\nNow, I'll collect like terms. Bring the M terms to one side.\n\n5516.16 = 1.124864 M + 1.0816 M\n\nAdding those coefficients: 1.124864 + 1.0816 = 2.206464\n\nSo 5516.16 = 2.206464 M\n\nTherefore, M = 5516.16 / 2.206464\n\nLet me compute that. Let's see, 5516.16 divided by 2.206464.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can approximate this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write it as:\n\nM = 5516.16 / (1.04 * 1.0816 + 1.0816) ?\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me just compute the division.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor out 1.04^2 from both sides.\n\nWait, another approach: let's write the initial equation again.\n\n(5100 - M) * (1.04)^2 = M * (1.04)^3\n\nDivide both sides by (1.04)^2:\n\n5100 - M = M * 1.04\n\nBecause (1.04)^3 divided by (1.04)^2 is 1.04.\n\nSo 5100 - M = 1.04 M\n\nThen, 5100 = 1.04 M + M = M (1 + 1.04) = M * 2.04\n\nSo M = 5100 / 2.04\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n5100 divided by 2.04.\n\nWell, 2.04 times 2500 is 5100, because 2.04 * 2500 = 5100.\n\nWait, 2.04 * 2500 = (2 * 2500) + (0.04 * 2500) = 5000 + 100 = 5100.\n\nYes! So M is 2500.\n\nWait, but wait, that would mean Sohan's share is 5100 - 2500 = 2600.\n\nLet me check the math again to make sure.\n\nSo, the equation after dividing by (1.04)^2:\n\n5100 - M = M * 1.04\n\nSo, 5100 = M + 1.04 M = 2.04 M\n\nM = 5100 / 2.04 = 2500.\n\nYes. So Mohan's share is 2500, which is option B.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm that the future values are equal.\n\nMohan's share is 2500, invested for 3 years at 4%: 2500*(1.04)^3.\n\nSohan's share is 2600, invested for 2 years: 2600*(1.04)^2.\n\nCompute both:\n\n(1.04)^2 = 1.0816. 2600 * 1.0816 = 2600 * 1.0816. Let me compute 2600 *1 = 2600, 2600 * 0.0816 = 2600 * 0.08 = 208, 2600 * 0.0016 =4.16. So 208 +4.16=212.16. So 2600+212.16=2812.16.\n\nMohan's: 2500*(1.04)^3. 1.04^3 is approximately 1.124864. So 2500 *1.124864 = 2812.16.\n\nYes, they are equal. So the calculation is correct.\n\nSo the answer is B) 2500.\n\n\nThe father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan (23 years old) and Sohan (24 years old), such that their shares, when invested at 4% compound interest, yield equal amounts when they both turn 26.

The total amount is \\( M + S = 5100 \\). The future value of their investments must be equal:\n\n\\[\nS \\cdot (1.04)^2 = M \\cdot (1.04)^3\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( S = 5100 - M \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[\n(5100 - M) \\cdot (1.04)^2 = M \\cdot (1.04)^3\n\\]\n\nSimplify \\( (1.04)^3 / (1.04)^2 = 1.04 \\):\n\n\\[\n5100 - M = M \\cdot 1.04\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[\n5100 = M \\cdot (1 + 1.04) = M \\cdot 2.04\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\( M \\):\n\n\\[\nM = \\frac{5100}{2.04} = 2500\n\\]\n\nThus, Mohan's share is Rs. 2500.
