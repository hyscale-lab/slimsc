      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out how old Rahim is now. Let's see what the problem says. Hmm. Raj was one-third as old as Rahim five years ago, and now Raj is 17. I need to find Rahim's current age.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. So, five years ago, Raj's age was a third of Rahim's age at that time. Now, Raj is 17, so I can find out how old Raj was five years ago. That should be 17 minus 5, which is 12. So, five years ago, Raj was 12.\n\nSince Raj was one-third as old as Rahim back then, that means 12 equals (1/3) of Rahim's age five years ago. So, to find out what Rahim's age was five years ago, I can set up an equation. Let me denote Rahim's age five years ago as R. So, 12 = (1/3) * R. To solve for R, I multiply both sides by 3. That gives R = 36. So, five years ago, Rahim was 36.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for Rahim's current age. So, if five years ago he was 36, now he's 36 plus 5 years. Let me calculate that: 36 + 5 is 41. So, Rahim is 41 years old now.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, five years ago, Raj was 12, and that was a third of Rahim's age. So, 12 * 3 is 36, which is what I had. Then, adding 5 years to 36 gives 41. So, the answer should be 41.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 41. So, the correct answer is B.\n",

The options are A)37, B)41, C)40, D)42, E)43.\n\nHmm, let me break it down. I'm a bit new to these kinds of problems, but I think I can handle it by setting up some equations.\n\nFirst, let's note the current ages. Raj is 17 now. So, right now, Raj's age is 17.\n\nThe problem mentions the past. Five years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim was at that time.
