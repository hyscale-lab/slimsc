      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a factory producing staplers. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Hmm, let's read the question again.\n\nSo, on Monday, 10% of the staplers were defective. That means 90% were non-defective. Then, 2% of these non-defective ones were rejected by mistake. And the number of non-defective staplers that were rejected is 72. I need to find the total number of staplers produced that day.\n\nAlright, let me break this down. Let's call the total number of staplers produced T. So, 10% are defective, which is 0.10*T. That leaves 0.90*T as non-defective.\n\nWait, the problem says 2% of the non-defective were rejected. So, 2% of 0.90*T equals 72. Oh, right, because 72 is the number of non-defective staplers rejected. So, I can set up an equation for that.\n\nLet me write that out: 2% of non-defective is 72. So, 0.02 * (0.90*T) = 72. That makes sense. Now I can solve for T.\n\nLet me compute that. 0.02 * 0.90 is 0.018. So, 0.018*T = 72. To find T, I divide both sides by 0.018.\n\nCalculating that: 72 divided by 0.018. Hmm, let's see. 72 divided by 0.018 is the same as 72 * (1/0.018). 1 divided by 0.018 is approximately 55.555... So, 72 * 55.555. Wait, that's a bit tricky. Let me think of it differently. Maybe multiply numerator and denominator by 1000 to eliminate decimals.\n\nSo, 72 / 0.018 = (72 * 1000) / 18. Because 0.018 is 18/1000. So, 72000 / 18. Let me do that division. 18 into 72000.\n\nWell, 18 * 4000 is 72000, right? Because 18*4000=72,000. So, 72000 divided by 18 is 4000. Oh, wait, that's T. So, the total number of staplers is 4000.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, A is 4000, which is the first option. But wait, did I make any mistake here? Let me double-check.\n\nSo, T is 4000. Non-defective would be 90% of that, which is 0.9*4000=3600. Then, 2% of 3600 is 72. Because 0.02 * 3600=72. Yep, that's correct. So the calculations seem right.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options again, I see option D is 4800. Did I perhaps miscalculate? Let me go through it again.\n\nWait, 0.02 * (0.90*T) =72. So, 0.018 T =72. T=72/0.018=4000. So, that's correct. So the answer should be 4000, which is option A.\n\nWait, but why is option D 4800? Maybe I'm missing something. Let me read the question again. It says 2% of the non-defective were rejected by mistake, and that was 72. So, 2% of non-defective equals 72. So, non-defective is 3600, which is 90% of 4000. So, everything checks out.\n\nI think the answer is A) 4000.\n",

Because 100% minus 10% defective is 90% non-defective.\n\nThen, it says that 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. Hmm, okay, so out of those non-defective ones, 2% got incorrectly rejected. And the number of non-defective staplers that were rejected is given as 72. So, 72 equals 2% of the non-defective ones.\n\nWait, so let me think. If 72 is 2% of the non-defective, then I can find the total non-defective number. Because 2% is like 0.02 in decimal. So, the equation would be 0.02 * (non-defective total) = 72. To find the non-defective total, I can rearrange that: non-defective total = 72 / 0.02.\n\nLet me calculate that. 72 divided by 0.02 is the same as 72 multiplied by 50, because 1/0.02 is 50. So 72 * 50 equals 3600. So the non-defective staplers are 3600.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the total number of staplers produced that day. Since 90% of the total were non-defective, I can let T be the total. So, 0.90 * T = 3600. To find T, I divide both sides by 0.90. So T = 3600 / 0.90.\n\nCalculating that, 3600 divided by 0.9. Well, 0.9 times 4000 is 3600, because 4000 * 0.9 is 3600. So T would be 4000.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps. 10% defective, so 90% non-defective. 2% of non-defective are rejected, which is 72. So 72 is 2% of non-defective, which gives non-defective as 72 / 0.02 = 3600. Then, since 3600 is 90% of the total, total is 3600 / 0.9 = 4000. That makes sense.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 4,000. So the answer should be A.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So I'm confident the answer is A.\n",
