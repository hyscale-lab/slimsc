      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question here: If 120 is reduced to 96, what is the reduction percent? Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on percentages, but I think I can figure this out.\n\nAlright, first, I remember that percentage reduction is calculated by finding the difference between the original number and the new number, then dividing by the original number, and finally multiplying by 100 to get the percentage. Let me break that down.\n\nThe original number is 120, and it's reduced to 96. So the first step is to find out how much it was reduced. That would be 120 minus 96. Let me calculate that: 120 - 96 equals 24. So the reduction is 24.\n\nNow, to find the percentage reduction, I need to compare this reduction to the original number. So I take 24 (the reduction) and divide it by 120 (the original number). Let me do that division: 24 divided by 120. Hmm, 24 into 120. Well, 120 divided by 24 is 5, but since it's 24 over 120, that's 1/5. Because 24 times 5 is 120. So 24/120 equals 0.2.\n\nWait, but I think I should double-check that division. 24 \u00f7 120. Alternatively, I can think of it as 24/120. Let me simplify that fraction. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 24. 24 \u00f724 is 1, and 120 \u00f724 is 5. So yeah, it's 1/5, which is 0.2.\n\nNow, to get the percentage, I multiply 0.2 by 100. So 0.2 *100 equals 20. So the percentage reduction is 20%. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 20%, so that must be the correct answer. Let me just make sure I didn't mix up anything. So 20% of 120 is 24, right? Because 120 *0.2 is 24. So subtracting 24 from 120 gives 96, which matches the question. Yep, that all adds up.\n\nI think I got this right. The answer should be option C, 20%.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the percentage reduction when 120 is reduced to 96, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the reduction amount**:  \n   Reduction = Original number - New number = 120 - 96 = 24.\n\n2. **Divide the reduction by the original number**:  \n   Reduction percentage = (Reduction / Original number) \u00d7 100 = (24 / 120) \u00d7 100.\n\n3. **Simplify the fraction**:  \n   24 \u00f7 120 = 0.2.\n\n4. **Convert to percentage**:  \n   0.2 \u00d7 100 = 20%.\n\nThus, the reduction percent is **20%**, which corresponds to option C.\n\nAnswer: C",

Hmm, I remember that percentage reduction is about finding out how much has been taken away relative to the original amount. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nWait, right. The formula for percentage decrease is [(Original Value - New Value)/Original Value] * 100. So the original value here is 120, and the new value is 96. So I subtract 96 from 120 first. Let me calculate that: 120 minus 96 equals 24. Oh, wait, no, wait. No, wait, that's the amount of reduction. So the decrease is 24.\n\nSo now I need to find what percentage 24 is of the original 120. So I take 24 divided by 120. Let's see, 24 divided by 120. Hmm, 24 goes into 120 five times because 24 times 5 is 120. Wait, no, 24 times 5 is 120, right. So 24/120 is 0.2. Oh, right, because 24 divided by 120 is the same as 24/(120) which simplifies to 1/5, which is 0.2. Then, to get the percentage, I multiply by 100, so 0.2 times 100 is 20%. So the reduction is 20%, right?\n\nWait, but let me double-check. 120 minus 20% is 96? Let me calculate 20% of 120. 20% is 0.2, so 0.2 times 120 is 24. So 120 minus 24 is 96. Yes, that matches the problem statement. So the reduction is indeed 20%.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 20%, so that should be the correct answer. I don't think I made any mistakes here.
