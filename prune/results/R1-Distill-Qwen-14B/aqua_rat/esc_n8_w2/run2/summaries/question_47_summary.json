      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about two cars starting from opposite ends of a 50-mile highway. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember something about relative speed when two objects are moving towards each other.\n\nSo, the first car is going at 12 mph and the second at 13 mph. Wait, since they're moving towards each other, their speeds add up, right? So together, they're closing the distance between them at 12 +13 =25 mph. Oh wait, that makes sense because if one is moving towards the other, the combined speed is the sum.\n\nThe total distance is 50 miles. So, I think I can use the formula: time = distance divided by speed. But wait, in this case, the distance is 50 miles, and the combined speed is 25 mph. So time equals 50 divided by 25. That should be 2 hours? Wait, but that doesn't match the options. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are A)1, B)1.25, C)1.50, D)1.75, E)2. Oh, option E is 2. So that would be the answer. Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: the distance each car covers until they meet. Let's say time is t. Then, the first car covers 12t miles, the second covers 13t miles. Together, their distances add up to 50 miles. So 12t +13t =50. That's 25t=50, so t=50/25=2. Yep, same as before. So the time is 2 hours. So the answer is E.\n",

Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nAlright, first, I remember that when two objects move towards each other, their speeds add up. Oh wait, right! Because they're approaching each other, the distance between them decreases at a combined rate. So the total speed is the sum of both cars' speeds.\n\nLet me jot down what I know. The highway is 50 miles long. Car one is going at 12 mph, and car two at 13 mph. So their combined speed is 12 + 13, which is 25 mph. Oh yeah, that makes sense because they're moving towards each other, so their speeds add.\n\nNow, the question is, how long until they meet. So time is what we're looking for. I remember the formula: time equals distance divided by speed. So time = distance / (speed1 + speed2). \n\nThe distance here is the entire length of the highway, 50 miles. So plugging the numbers in, that's 50 divided by 25. Let's see, 50 \u00f7 25 equals 2. Wait, no, wait a minute. Oh no, wait, that can't be right because 25 times 2 is 50. So the time would be 2 hours?\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 2. But wait, let me think again. Because both cars are moving towards each other, their closing speed is 25 mph, so yes, they should meet after 2 hours. Hmm, but wait, the options don't have 2 as the correct answer because the options are A) 1, B) 1.25, C) 1.50, D) 1.75, E) 2. Oh wait, E is 2. So that would be the answer. But wait, wait a second. Maybe I'm making a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is, in one hour, how much distance would they cover together. Car one goes 12 miles, car two 13, so together 25 miles. So in one hour, they reduce the distance by 25 miles. The total distance is 50, so it would take two hours to cover the entire 50 miles. So yeah, 2 hours. So the answer is E.\n\nBut wait, wait another thought. Oh wait, no, that's correct. Because 25 mph for 2 hours is 50 miles. So yes, the answer should be E. But wait, why am I doubting myself? Maybe I should see if the options have E as 2. Yes, option E is 2. So the correct answer is E) 2.\n\nWait, but the initial problem says \"how long after they begin will they meet?\" So yeah, 2 hours is correct.
