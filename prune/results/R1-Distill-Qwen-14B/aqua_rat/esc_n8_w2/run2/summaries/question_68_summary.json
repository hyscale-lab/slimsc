      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question is about figuring out how many helpers are needed to prepare a certain number of cakes. Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour. The kitchen is available for 3 hours and 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes are needed. So, the task is to find out how many helpers are required.\n\nHmm, I think I need to calculate the total work required and then see how much each helper can contribute in the given time.\n\nLet me break it down. First, for the large cakes. We need 20 of them. Each helper can make 2 large cakes per hour. And the kitchen is available for 3 hours. So, how many helpers do we need just for the large cakes?\n\nWait, wait. But each helper can only make one type of cake at a time, right? So if a helper is making large cakes, they can't make small ones. So I might need to consider the helpers as being split between making large and small cakes.\n\nBut maybe it's better to think about the total number of large and small cakes each helper can make in 3 hours, and then see how many helpers are needed in total.\n\nSo, each helper can make 2 large cakes per hour. In 3 hours, one helper can make 2 * 3 = 6 large cakes. Or, alternatively, for small cakes, 35 per hour, so 35 *3 = 105 small cakes per helper in 3 hours.\n\nWait, but the problem is we need 20 large and 700 small. So perhaps I should calculate how many helpers are needed for each type and sum them up.\n\nLet me think. For the large cakes: each helper can make 6 per 3 hours. So to get 20, how many helpers do I need? 20 /6 is approximately 3.333. But you can't have a fraction of a helper, so you'd need 4 helpers for the large cakes.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me check that. 4 helpers *6 cakes each = 24. But we only need 20. That's more than enough. So 4 helpers would produce 24, which is more than 20. Alternatively, maybe 3 helpers would produce 18, which is less than 20. So we need at least 4 helpers for the large cakes.\n\nBut wait, maybe some helpers can be assigned to small cakes and others to large. So perhaps the total helpers required would be the sum of helpers needed for each type.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's more efficient to have some helpers make large and others make small, but in any case, the total number of helpers would be the sum.\n\nWait, let me calculate for each type.\n\nFor large cakes:\nNumber of helpers needed (L) = Total needed / (2 * 3) = 20 /6 \u2248 3.333. So you'd need 4 helpers, as you can't have a fraction.\n\nFor small cakes:\nNumber of helpers needed (S) = 700 / (35 *3) = 700/105 \u22486.666. So you'd need 7 helpers.\n\nWait, 35 per hour, so 3 hours is 105 per helper. 700 divided by 105 is about 6.666, so 7 helpers.\n\nSo total helpers would be 4 +7=11. But none of the options is 11. The options are A)8, B)10, C)12, D)15, E)19.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of assigning some helpers to large and others to small, maybe we can have some helpers work part of the time on large and part on small. Because the question doesn't say that each helper has to choose one type. Hmm, but I think each helper can only do one type of cake at a time. Or can they switch?\n\nWait, the question says each helper can make either 2 large or 35 small cakes per hour. So I think they can choose which type they make each hour, but they can't make both at the same time. So perhaps a helper can make large cakes for a certain number of hours and small cakes for others.\n\nWait, but the kitchen is available for 3 hours. So perhaps some helpers can work on large for part of the time and small for the rest. Let me think about that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as a system of equations where the total large cakes and small cakes are the sum of helpers working on each type multiplied by their respective rates.\n\nLet me define variables:\n\nLet x = number of helpers making large cakes for all 3 hours.\n\nLet y = number of helpers making small cakes for all 3 hours.\n\nBut then, the total large cakes would be x * 2 * 3 = 6x.\n\nTotal small cakes would be y *35 *3= 105y.\n\nWe need 6x >=20 and 105y >=700.\n\nBut wait, this approach would require x and y to be integers, and the sum x+y is the total helpers.\n\nSo, for x: 6x >=20 \u2192 x >= 20/6 \u22483.333 \u2192 x=4.\n\nFor y: 105y >=700 \u2192 y >=700/105\u22486.666 \u2192 y=7.\n\nSo total helpers would be 4+7=11, which isn't one of the options. So that's a problem.\n\nBut the options don't have 11. So perhaps I'm not considering that some helpers can work on both types, but not simultaneously. Maybe some helpers can work on large for part of the time and small for the rest.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a better approach. Let me think: each helper can contribute to both large and small cakes, but only one type at a time.\n\nSo, for example, a helper can spend t hours on large and (3-t) hours on small. Then, the total large cakes from that helper would be 2t, and small would be 35(3-t).\n\nBut then, for all helpers, the sum of their contributions needs to meet or exceed 20 large and 700 small.\n\nThis complicates things, but perhaps it's more efficient.\n\nSo, let's model this. Let me denote:\n\nEach helper can contribute 2t large and 35(3-t) small, where t is the time they spend on large cakes (in hours, 0<=t<=3).\n\nBut this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to find the minimal number of helpers by maximizing their contribution.\n\nWait, perhaps the total work required is 20 large and 700 small.\n\nEach helper can produce 2 large per hour or 35 small per hour.\n\nSo, perhaps the total \"effort\" in terms of cakes is 20 + 700 =720.\n\nBut each helper can make either 2 large or 35 small per hour. So in 3 hours, each helper can make 6 large or 105 small.\n\nBut the problem is that the required cakes are of two different types, so perhaps the helpers can be split between the two tasks.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate the number of helpers required if all helpers worked on large cakes, and then see if the small cakes can be handled by some of them in the remaining time.\n\nWait, but that approach might not work because if a helper is working on large cakes for part of the time, they can't contribute to small cakes in the same time.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of this as a linear programming problem. But since it's a multiple-choice question, maybe I can find the minimal number of helpers that can meet both requirements.\n\nLet me think about the total number of helpers, N. Each helper can contribute some amount to large and some to small, but the sum of their contributions must meet the required amounts.\n\nSo, the sum of (number of helpers assigned to large * 6) >=20.\n\nAnd the sum of (number of helpers assigned to small *105)>=700.\n\nLet me define x as the number of helpers assigned to large cakes, y assigned to small. So x + y = N.\n\nWe have 6x >=20 \u2192 x >=4 (since 4*6=24 >=20).\n\nAnd 105y >=700 \u2192 y >=700/105=6.666 \u2192 y=7.\n\nSo N = x + y >=4 +7=11. But 11 is not an option. The options are 8,10,12,15,19.\n\nHmm. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe some helpers can do both, but that's not possible since they can only make one type at a time. Wait, unless they split their time between the two.\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe some helpers can work on large cakes for a certain time and small for the remaining time.\n\nSo, for each helper, the total large cakes they can make is 2 * t, where t is the time they spend on large, and the small is 35*(3 -t).\n\nSo, for each helper, the total large and small they can contribute is 2t and 35(3-t).\n\nThe sum across all helpers must be at least 20 and 700.\n\nSo, let me denote:\n\nSum over all helpers: 2t_i >=20,\n\nand Sum over all helpers: 35*(3 -t_i) >=700.\n\nBut this seems a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a system where each helper contributes some to both, but that's complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of helpers is when each helper contributes as much as possible to both. But that might not be possible because each helper can't split their time unless they work on different tasks at different times.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the total number of helpers is such that the sum of their contributions in both types meets the requirements.\n\nSo, each helper can contribute a certain amount of large and small cakes, depending on how much time they spend on each.\n\nBut this is getting a bit too abstract. Maybe I should try to see which of the options meets the required number of cakes.\n\nLet me try the options given.\n\nOption A:8 helpers.\n\nTotal possible large cakes if all 8 worked on large: 8 *6=48. We need 20, so that's more than enough.\n\nBut what about small cakes? If all 8 helpers worked on small, they'd make 8*105=840, which is more than 700.\n\nBut we can't have all helpers working on both. So perhaps some helpers work on large, others on small.\n\nSuppose x helpers work on large, and (8 -x) work on small.\n\nThen, the large cakes would be 6x >=20 \u2192 x >=4.\n\nSmall cakes would be 105*(8-x) >=700 \u2192 8 -x >=700/105 \u2192 8 -x >=6.666 \u2192 x <=1.333.\n\nWait, that's a problem because x has to be >=4 and <=1.333 at the same time. That's impossible. So 8 helpers can't meet both requirements if some are assigned to large and others to small.\n\nWait, maybe that's not the right approach. Maybe some helpers work on both. Let's think about that.\n\nEach helper can spend t hours on large and (3-t) on small.\n\nSo, each helper contributes 2t large and 35(3-t) small.\n\nWe have N helpers, each contributing 2t_i and 35(3-t_i).\n\nSum all 2t_i >=20,\n\nSum all 35(3-t_i) >=700.\n\nWe need to find the minimal N where these conditions are met.\n\nLet me express the second condition:\n\n35 * sum(3 - t_i) >=700 \u2192 sum(3 - t_i) >=20 \u2192 sum(3) - sum(t_i) >=20 \u2192 3N - sum(t_i) >=20 \u2192 sum(t_i) <=3N -20.\n\nThe first condition is sum(t_i) >=20/2=10 \u2192 sum(t_i)>=10.\n\nSo, we have 10 <= sum(t_i) <=3N -20.\n\nWhich implies 10 <=3N -20 \u2192 3N >=30 \u2192 N>=10.\n\nSo N must be at least 10.\n\nLooking back at the options, B is 10.\n\nSo, can 10 helpers meet the conditions?\n\nLet's see.\n\nWe have sum(t_i) must be >=10 and <=3*10 -20=10.\n\nSo sum(t_i) must be exactly 10.\n\nSo each helper's t_i must sum to 10.\n\nAnd the small cake sum is 35*(3*10 - sum(t_i)) =35*(30-10)=35*20=700, which meets the requirement.\n\nSo, each helper must contribute a total of 2t_i to large cakes, and the sum of all 2t_i must be >=20.\n\nSince sum(t_i)=10, sum(2t_i)=20, which exactly meets the 20 required.\n\nSo, 10 helpers can each spend t_i hours on large cakes, with the sum of t_i being 10.\n\nEach helper's t_i can vary, but the sum must be 10.\n\nFor example, each helper can spend 1 hour on large and 2 on small. Because 10 helpers *1h =10h, which meets sum(t_i)=10.\n\nSo, each helper's contribution would be 2*1=2 large, and 35*2=70 small.\n\nSo 10 helpers would make 10*2=20 large, and 10*70=700 small. Exactly meets the requirements.\n\nSo, 10 helpers are sufficient.\n\nLooking back at the options, B is 10.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the number of helpers required, we analyze the problem as follows:\n\nEach helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour.

However, 11 is not one of the options.\n\n4. **Optimization by Splitting Time**:\n   - Helpers can split their time between large and small cakes. Let \\( t_i \\) be the time (in hours) that helper \\( i \\) spends on large cakes. The total contribution of all helpers must satisfy:\n     \\[\n     \\sum (2t_i) \\geq 20 \\, \\text{(large cakes)}, \\quad \\sum (35(3 - t_i)) \\geq 700 \\, \\text{(small cakes)}.\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying the second condition:\n     \\[\n     \\sum (35(3 - t_i)) = 35 \\sum (3 - t_i) \\geq 700 \\, \\Rightarrow \\, \\sum (3 - t_i) \\geq 20.\n     \\]\n   - Since \\( \\sum t_i \\leq 3N - 20 \\), where \\( N \\) is the total number of helpers, and \\( \\sum t_i \\geq 10 \\) (from the first condition), we find:\n     \\[\n     10 \\leq 3N - 20 \\, \\Rightarrow \\, 3N \\geq 30 \\, \\Rightarrow \\, N \\geq 10.\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verification for \\( N = 10 \\)**:\n   - If \\( N = 10 \\), \\( \\sum t_i = 10 \\) (to meet the large cake requirement exactly). The small cakes requirement is also satisfied:\n     \\[\n     \\sum (35(3 - t_i)) = 35(3 \\times 10 - 10) = 35 \\times 20 = 700.\n     \\]\n   - Thus, 10 helpers can meet both requirements by splitting their time appropriately.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe minimal number of helpers required is **10**, which corresponds to option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

Let's think about that.\n\nEach helper can spend t hours on large and (3-t) on small.\n\nSo, each helper contributes 2t large and 35(3-t) small.\n\nWe have N helpers, each contributing 2t_i and 35(3-t_i).\n\nSum all 2t_i >=20,\n\nSum all 35(3-t_i) >=700.\n\nWe need to find the minimal N where these conditions are met.\n\nLet me express the second condition:\n\n35 * sum(3 - t_i) >=700 \u2192 sum(3 - t_i) >=20 \u2192 sum(3) - sum(t_i) >=20 \u2192 3N - sum(t_i) >=20 \u2192 sum(t_i) <=3N -20.\n\nThe first condition is sum(t_i) >=20/2=10 \u2192 sum(t_i)>=10.\n\nSo, we have 10 <= sum(t_i) <=3N -20.\n\nWhich implies 10 <=3N -20 \u2192 3N >=30 \u2192 N>=10.\n\nSo N must be at least 10.\n\nLooking back at the options, B is 10.\n\nSo, can 10 helpers meet the conditions?\n\nLet's see.\n\nWe have sum(t_i) must be >=10 and <=3*10 -20=10.\n\nSo sum(t_i) must be exactly 10.\n\nSo each helper's t_i must sum to 10.\n\nAnd the small cake sum is 35*(3*10 - sum(t_i)) =35*(30-10)=35*20=700, which meets the requirement.\n\nSo, each helper must contribute a total of 2t_i to large cakes, and the sum of all 2t_i must be >=20.\n\nSince sum(t_i)=10, sum(2t_i)=20, which exactly meets the 20 required.\n\nSo, 10 helpers can each spend t_i hours on large cakes, with the sum of t_i being 10.\n\nEach helper's t_i can vary, but the sum must be 10.\n\nFor example, each helper can spend 1 hour on large and 2 on small. Because 10 helpers *1h =10h, which meets sum(t_i)=10.\n\nSo, each helper's contribution would be 2*1=2 large, and 35*2=70 small.\n\nSo 10 helpers would make 10*2=20 large, and 10*70=700 small. Exactly meets the requirements.\n\nSo, 10 helpers are sufficient.\n\nLooking back at the options, B is 10.\n\n\nTo determine the number of helpers required, we analyze the problem as follows:\n\nEach helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour. The kitchen is available for 3 hours, and the total number of cakes needed is 20 large and 700 small. \n\n### Key Calculations:\n1. **Large Cakes Requirement**:\n   - Each helper can make \\( 2 \\, \\text{large cakes/hour} \\times 3 \\, \\text{hours} = 6 \\, \\text{large cakes} \\).\n   - To produce 20 large cakes, the number of helpers required is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Helpers for large cakes} = \\frac{20}{6} \\approx 3.333 \\, \\Rightarrow \\, 4 \\, \\text{helpers (since partial helpers are not possible)}.\n     \\]\n\n2. **Small Cakes Requirement**:\n   - Each helper can make \\( 35 \\, \\text{small cakes/hour} \\times 3 \\, \\text{hours} = 105 \\, \\text{small cakes} \\).\n   - To produce 700 small cakes, the number of helpers required is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Helpers for small cakes} = \\frac{700}{105} \\approx 6.666 \\, \\Rightarrow \\, 7 \\, \\text{helpers (since partial helpers are not possible)}.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Total Helpers**:\n   - If helpers are assigned exclusively to large or small cakes, the total number of helpers required is \\( 4 + 7 = 11 \\). However, 11 is not one of the options.\n\n4. **Optimization by Splitting Time**:\n   - Helpers can split their time between large and small cakes. Let \\( t_i \\) be the time (in hours) that helper \\( i \\) spends on large cakes. The total contribution of all helpers must satisfy:\n     \\[\n     \\sum (2t_i) \\geq 20 \\, \\text{(large cakes)}, \\quad \\sum (35(3 - t_i)) \\geq 700 \\, \\text{(small cakes)}.\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying the second condition:\n     \\[\n     \\sum (35(3 - t_i)) = 35 \\sum (3 - t_i) \\geq 700 \\, \\Rightarrow \\, \\sum (3 - t_i) \\geq 20.\n     \\]\n   - Since \\( \\sum t_i \\leq 3N - 20 \\), where \\( N \\) is the total number of helpers, and \\( \\sum t_i \\geq 10 \\) (from the first condition), we find:\n     \\[\n     10 \\leq 3N - 20 \\, \\Rightarrow \\, 3N \\geq 30 \\, \\Rightarrow \\, N \\geq 10.\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verification for \\( N = 10 \\)**:\n   - If \\( N = 10 \\), \\( \\sum t_i = 10 \\) (to meet the large cake requirement exactly). The small cakes requirement is also satisfied:\n     \\[\n     \\sum (35(3 - t_i)) = 35(3 \\times 10 - 10) = 35 \\times 20 = 700.\n     \\]\n   - Thus, 10 helpers can meet both requirements by splitting their time appropriately.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe minimal number of helpers required is **10**, which corresponds to option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, so the question is about figuring out how many helpers are needed to make a certain number of cakes within a given time. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nSo, each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour. The kitchen is available for 3 hours. We need to prepare 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes. How many helpers are required?\n\nWait, I think each helper can choose to make either large or small cakes, not both at the same time. So, perhaps we need to split the helpers into two groups: some making large cakes and others making small ones.\n\nLet me structure the information.\n\nTotal time available: 3 hours.\n\nNumber of large cakes needed: 20.\n\nNumber of small cakes needed: 700.\n\nEach helper makes 2 large cakes per hour. So, one helper can make 2 * time = number of large cakes. Similarly, for small cakes, each helper makes 35 per hour, so 35 * time for small.\n\nLet me denote:\nLet x = number of helpers making large cakes.\nLet y = number of helpers making small cakes.\nTotal helpers needed: x + y.\n\nWe need to find x and y such that:\n\nFor large cakes: 2 * x * 3 >= 20\nBecause each helper makes 2 large cakes per hour, multiplied by 3 hours, multiplied by the number of helpers x.\n\nSimilarly, for small cakes: 35 * y * 3 >= 700.\n\nWait, wait. Let me re-express that.\n\nThe number of large cakes produced is 2 * x * 3. This should be >=20.\n\nSo equation 1: 6x >=20 \u2192 x >=20/6 \u2192 x >=3.333. Since x must be an integer, x >=4.\n\nEquation 2: 35*y*3 >=700 \u2192 105y >=700 \u2192 y >=700/105 \u2192 y >=6.666. So y >=7.\n\nSo x must be at least 4, y at least 7. So total helpers would be 4 +7=11. But wait, the options don't have 11. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps some helpers can switch between tasks? No, each helper can make either large or small cakes. So we can't have a helper making both.\n\nWait, maybe there's a more efficient way. Like, using some helpers on large and some on small, but perhaps not all helpers are needed in both.\n\nWait, but the question is to meet the required number of cakes, so we have to reach at least the required numbers.\n\nSo let's recalculate.\n\nFor large cakes:\n\nEach helper can make 2 per hour, so in 3 hours, 6 per helper.\n\nWe need 20, so 20 /6 = 3.333 helpers. So we need 4 helpers for large cakes.\n\nEach helper making small cakes can make 35 per hour, so 105 per helper in 3 hours.\n\nWe need 700 small cakes. So 700 /105 is approximately 6.666, so 7 helpers.\n\nSo total helpers would be 4 +7 =11. But the options are A)8, B)10, C)12, D)15, E)19. Hmm, 11 isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the helpers can split their time between large and small cakes. But the question says each helper can make either 2 large or 35 small per hour. So they can't do both at the same time, but perhaps they can split their time if needed, as long as the total per helper per hour is either 2 large or 35 small.\n\nWait, that's a different approach. So maybe some helpers can work on large cakes for part of the time and small cakes for the other part. But that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that we can have helpers working on large or small, but perhaps we can have some helpers working on large and others on small, and the total number of helpers required is the sum.\n\nWait, but my initial calculation gives 11, which isn't an option. So maybe I should re-examine my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it with variables.\n\nLet me denote x as the number of helpers assigned to large cakes, y to small. So x + y is the total helpers.\n\nEach helper on large cakes makes 2 per hour, so in 3 hours: 2 *3 * x =6x large cakes.\n\nEach helper on small makes 35 per hour, so 35*3*y=105 y small cakes.\n\nWe have constraints:\n\n6x >=20 \u2192 x >= 20/6 \u22483.333 \u2192 x=4.\n\n105y >=700 \u2192 y >=700/105 =6.666\u2192 y=7.\n\nSo x=4, y=7. Total helpers 11. But that's not an option. So perhaps the question expects a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the helpers can't split their time, so each helper is assigned to only one type of cake. So in that case, the initial calculation holds, but perhaps the problem requires that the total number of helpers is such that all cakes are made, possibly assigning helpers to both tasks but with the same person working on both. But that's not possible as per the problem statement.\n\nWait, maybe the problem expects that the helpers can be assigned to either large or small, but the total number of helpers should be such that the time taken is within 3 hours.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the time needed for each type of cake.\n\nWait, time to make 20 large cakes with x helpers: 20/(2x) hours. Similarly, time to make 700 small cakes with y helpers:700/(35 y) hours.\n\nBut the total time must be <=3 hours.\n\nWait, no, because the helpers are working simultaneously on each task.\n\nWait, but that's not the case. Wait, each helper can only do one type. So, the time taken would be the maximum of the two times.\n\nBecause, for example, if it takes 2 hours to make all the large cakes, and 3 hours to make all the small cakes, then the total time is 3 hours. So the maximum of the two times must be <=3.\n\nSo let's model it:\n\nTime for large cakes: (20)/(2x) =10/x hours.\n\nTime for small cakes:700/(35 y)=20/y hours.\n\nWe need max(10/x,20/y) <=3.\n\nWe need to find x and y such that this condition holds, and x and y are integers >=1.\n\nWe need to minimize x + y.\n\nWait, but the problem isn't about minimizing helpers, but the question is, given that we need to get 20 and 700, how many helpers are needed. Wait, no, the question says, how many helpers are required. So perhaps the question is to find the minimal number of helpers such that both constraints are met within 3 hours.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the problem as:\n\nLet me think in terms of total capacity.\n\nEach helper can contribute either 6 large cakes or 105 small cakes in 3 hours.\n\nWe need 20 large and 700 small.\n\nSo, if we have x helpers making large, they produce 6x cakes.\n\ny helpers making small, produce 105y cakes.\n\nConstraints:\n\n6x >=20 \u2192 x >= 20/6 \u22483.333 \u2192 x=4.\n\n105y >=700 \u2192 y >=6.666 \u2192 y=7.\n\nSo x=4, y=7. Total helpers 11.\n\nBut since 11 isn't an option, perhaps the problem is considering that helpers can be assigned to both tasks, but each helper can't split their time. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the total helpers must be the same for both. Like, some helpers are assigned to large, others to small, but all helpers work the entire 3 hours.\n\nWait, no, that's what I did earlier. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes/hr.\"\n\nSo each helper can choose to make large or small cakes, but can't do both at the same time. But perhaps the same helper can switch between the two during the 3 hours. But that complicates the calculation, as each helper's time is split between the two tasks.\n\nWait, but that's more complicated. Let me think: suppose a helper spends t hours on large cakes and (3-t) hours on small cakes. Then, the number of large cakes they make is 2t, and small cakes 35*(3-t). But then, you'd have to sum over all helpers.\n\nBut this seems more complex, but perhaps it's the approach we should take to find the minimal number of helpers.\n\nWait, but maybe it's possible that by having some helpers split their time, we can meet the requirements with fewer helpers.\n\nWait, let me model this. Let me assume that all helpers are working for the entire 3 hours, but some may split their time between the two tasks.\n\nLet me denote t as the time (in hours) a helper spends on large cakes, and (3-t) on small cakes.\n\nEach helper contributes 2t large cakes and 35*(3-t) small cakes.\n\nLet the number of helpers be n.\n\nEach helper can contribute a certain amount to both, but let's sum over all helpers.\n\nTotal large cakes: sum(2t_i) for i=1 to n \u226520.\n\nTotal small cakes: sum(35*(3 - t_i)) for i=1 to n \u2265700.\n\nWe need to find the minimal n such that these inequalities are satisfied.\n\nBut this seems more complex. Let me see if I can find a way to model this.\n\nLet me denote the average time each helper spends on large cakes as t. So, for all helpers, t_i = t on average. Then, the total large cakes would be 2t *n \u226520 \u2192 t \u226520/(2n) \u2192 t \u226510/n.\n\nSimilarly, the small cakes: each helper contributes 35*(3-t) \u2192 total is 35*(3-t)*n \u2265700 \u2192 35*(3-t)*n \u2265700 \u2192 (3-t)*n \u2265700/35 \u2192 (3-t)*n \u226520 \u2192 3n -n t \u226520.\n\nFrom the first inequality: t \u226510/n.\n\nSubstituting into the second equation:\n\n3n -n*(10/n) \u226520 \u21923n -10 \u226520 \u21923n \u226530 \u2192n\u226510.\n\nSo n must be at least 10.\n\nBut wait, let's check if n=10 is sufficient.\n\nAt n=10, the average t must be \u226510/10=1 hour.\n\nSo t=1.\n\nThen, for small cakes, each helper contributes 35*(3-1)=70. For 10 helpers, that's 70*10=700, which meets the requirement.\n\nAnd for large cakes, each helper contributes 2*1=2. 10 helpers contribute 20, which meets the requirement exactly.\n\nSo n=10 is sufficient.\n\nWait, that's one of the options: option B is 10.\n\nSo the minimal number of helpers is 10.\n\nHmm, so my initial approach where I assumed helpers were split into two groups gave me 11, but by allowing helpers to split their time, 10 helpers suffice.\n\nSo the correct answer would be 10 helpers.\n\nWait, but why did the first approach give 11? Because in the first approach, each helper is dedicated to either large or small. But by allowing some helpers to work on both, perhaps in a way that their time is split, we can meet the requirements with fewer helpers.\n\nBut how does that work? Let me think: if each of the 10 helpers spends 1 hour on large and 2 hours on small, then each helper makes 2 large and 70 small cakes. So 10 helpers make 20 large and 700 small. Exactly meeting the requirements.\n\nSo that works.\n\nSo the correct answer is 10 helpers, which is option B.\n",

So the maximum of the two times must be <=3.\n\nSo let's model it:\n\nTime for large cakes: (20)/(2x) =10/x hours.\n\nTime for small cakes:700/(35 y)=20/y hours.\n\nWe need max(10/x,20/y) <=3.\n\nWe need to find x and y such that this condition holds, and x and y are integers >=1.\n\nWe need to minimize x + y.\n\nWait, but the problem isn't about minimizing helpers, but the question is, given that we need to get 20 and 700, how many helpers are needed. Wait, no, the question says, how many helpers are required. So perhaps the question is to find the minimal number of helpers such that both constraints are met within 3 hours.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the problem as:\n\nLet me think in terms of total capacity.\n\nEach helper can contribute either 6 large cakes or 105 small cakes in 3 hours.\n\nWe need 20 large and 700 small.\n\nSo, if we have x helpers making large, they produce 6x cakes.\n\ny helpers making small, produce 105y cakes.\n\nConstraints:\n\n6x >=20 \u2192 x >= 20/6 \u22483.333 \u2192 x=4.\n\n105y >=700 \u2192 y >=6.666 \u2192 y=7.\n\nSo x=4, y=7. Total helpers 11.\n\nBut since 11 isn't an option, perhaps the problem is considering that helpers can be assigned to both tasks, but each helper can't split their time. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the total helpers must be the same for both. Like, some helpers are assigned to large, others to small, but all helpers work the entire 3 hours.\n\nWait, no, that's what I did earlier. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes/hr.\"\n\nSo each helper can choose to make large or small cakes, but can't do both at the same time. But perhaps the same helper can switch between the two during the 3 hours. But that complicates the calculation, as each helper's time is split between the two tasks.\n\nWait, but that's more complicated. Let me think: suppose a helper spends t hours on large cakes and (3-t) hours on small cakes. Then, the number of large cakes they make is 2t, and small cakes 35*(3-t). But then, you'd have to sum over all helpers.\n\nBut this seems more complex, but perhaps it's the approach we should take to find the minimal number of helpers.\n\nWait, but maybe it's possible that by having some helpers split their time, we can meet the requirements with fewer helpers.\n\nWait, let me model this. Let me assume that all helpers are working for the entire 3 hours, but some may split their time between the two tasks.\n\nLet me denote t as the time (in hours) a helper spends on large cakes, and (3-t) on small cakes.\n\nEach helper contributes 2t large cakes and 35*(3-t) small cakes.\n\nLet the number of helpers be n.\n\nEach helper can contribute a certain amount to both, but let's sum over all helpers.\n\nTotal large cakes: sum(2t_i) for i=1 to n \u226520.\n\nTotal small cakes: sum(35*(3 - t_i)) for i=1 to n \u2265700.\n\nWe need to find the minimal n such that these inequalities are satisfied.\n\nBut this seems more complex. Let me see if I can find a way to model this.\n\nLet me denote the average time each helper spends on large cakes as t. So, for all helpers, t_i = t on average. Then, the total large cakes would be 2t *n \u226520 \u2192 t \u226520/(2n) \u2192 t \u226510/n.\n\nSimilarly, the small cakes: each helper contributes 35*(3-t) \u2192 total is 35*(3-t)*n \u2265700 \u2192 35*(3-t)*n \u2265700 \u2192 (3-t)*n \u2265700/35 \u2192 (3-t)*n \u226520 \u2192 3n -n t \u226520.\n\nFrom the first inequality: t \u226510/n.\n\nSubstituting into the second equation:\n\n3n -n*(10/n) \u226520 \u21923n -10 \u226520 \u21923n \u226530 \u2192n\u226510.\n\nSo n must be at least 10.\n\nBut wait, let's check if n=10 is sufficient.\n\nAt n=10, the average t must be \u226510/10=1 hour.\n\nSo t=1.\n\nThen, for small cakes, each helper contributes 35*(3-1)=70. For 10 helpers, that's 70*10=700, which meets the requirement.\n\nAnd for large cakes, each helper contributes 2*1=2. 10 helpers contribute 20, which meets the requirement exactly.\n\nSo n=10 is sufficient.\n\nWait, that's one of the options: option B is 10.\n\nSo the minimal number of helpers is 10.\n\nHmm, so my initial approach where I assumed helpers were split into two groups gave me 11, but by allowing helpers to split their time, 10 helpers suffice.\n\nSo the correct answer would be 10 helpers.\n\nWait, but why did the first approach give 11? Because in the first approach, each helper is dedicated to either large or small. But by allowing some helpers to work on both, perhaps in a way that their time is split, we can meet the requirements with fewer helpers.\n\nBut how does that work? Let me think: if each of the 10 helpers spends 1 hour on large and 2 hours on small, then each helper makes 2 large and 70 small cakes. So 10 helpers make 20 large and 700 small. Exactly meeting the requirements.\n\nSo that works.\n\nSo the correct answer is 10 helpers, which is option B.\n\n\nTo determine the number of helpers required, we analyze the problem as follows:\n\nEach helper can either make 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour. The kitchen is available for 3 hours, and we need to produce 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes. Helpers can split their time between tasks, meaning a helper can spend part of their time making large cakes and the rest making small cakes.\n\n### Key Calculations:\n1. **Large Cakes Requirement**:\n   - Each helper can make 2 large cakes per hour. Over 3 hours, a helper can make \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\) large cakes.\n   - To produce 20 large cakes, the number of helpers required is:\n     \\[\n     x \\geq \\frac{20}{6} \\approx 3.333 \\implies x = 4 \\text{ (since helpers must be integers)}.\n     \\]\n\n2. **Small Cakes Requirement**:\n   - Each helper can make 35 small cakes per hour. Over 3 hours, a helper can make \\( 35 \\times 3 = 105 \\) small cakes.\n   - To produce 700 small cakes, the number of helpers required is:\n     \\[\n     y \\geq \\frac{700}{105} \\approx 6.666 \\implies y = 7 \\text{ (since helpers must be integers)}.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Total Helpers Without Time Splitting**:\n   - If helpers are dedicated exclusively to one task, the total number of helpers required is:\n     \\[\n     x + y = 4 + 7 = 11.\n     \\]\n   - However, 11 is not one of the answer choices, so we consider the possibility of helpers splitting their time between tasks.\n\n4. **Helpers Splitting Time**:\n   - If helpers split their time, each helper can contribute to both tasks. Let \\( t \\) be the time (in hours) a helper spends on large cakes, and \\( 3 - t \\) be the time spent on small cakes.\n   - For large cakes, the total contribution from \\( n \\) helpers is:\n     \\[\n     2t \\cdot n \\geq 20 \\implies t \\geq \\frac{10}{n}.\n     \\]\n   - For small cakes, the total contribution from \\( n \\) helpers is:\n     \\[\n     35(3 - t) \\cdot n \\geq 700 \\implies (3 - t) \\cdot n \\geq 20.\n     \\]\n   - Substituting \\( t \\geq \\frac{10}{n} \\) into the second inequality:\n     \\[\n     3n - n \\cdot \\frac{10}{n} \\geq 20 \\implies 3n - 10 \\geq 20 \\implies 3n \\geq 30 \\implies n \\geq 10.\n     \\]\n   - Thus, \\( n = 10 \\) helpers are sufficient. Each helper spends \\( t = 1 \\) hour on large cakes and \\( 3 - t = 2 \\) hours on small cakes:\n     - Large cakes: \\( 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 10 = 20 \\).\n     - Small cakes: \\( 35 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10 = 700 \\).\n   - Both requirements are met exactly with 10 helpers.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy allowing helpers to split their time between tasks, the minimal number of helpers required is **10**.\n\nAnswer: B",
