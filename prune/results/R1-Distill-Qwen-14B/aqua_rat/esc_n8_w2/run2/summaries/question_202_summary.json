      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.\n\nAlright, the problem is about Sam's hard drive with 250 files. All of them are infected by either a virus or a worm, or both. Hmm, so that means every file has at least one infection. So, the total number of files is 250, and all are in the union of virus and worm infections.\n\nThe first part says, \"The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm.\" Wait, okay. So, let me define some variables. Let me think:\n\nLet me denote:\n- V as the number of files infected by a virus.\n- W as the number of files infected by a worm.\n- B as the number of files infected by both virus and worm.\n\nSo, according to the problem, the number of files only with a worm (so W - B) is 2.5 times B. So, W - B = 2.5 * B. That simplifies to W = 3.5 * B. Hmm, that makes sense.\n\nNext part: \"50% of the files were not infected by a virus.\" Oh, okay. So, 50% of 250 is 125 files. So, 125 files are not infected by a virus. Which means those files are only infected by a worm or maybe neither. Wait, but the problem says all files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. So, no files are uninfected. So, the 125 files not infected by a virus must be the ones infected only by a worm. Because if a file isn't infected by a virus, it must be infected by a worm, since all are infected by at least one.\n\nSo, the number of files infected only by a worm is 125. Because 50% of 250 is 125, and those are the ones not infected by a virus. So, only worm infections. \n\nWait, earlier I had W - B = 2.5 * B, so W = 3.5 B. But now, since the only worm-infected files are 125, that's W - B = 125. So, substituting into the earlier equation, 125 = 2.5 B. Let me solve for B.\n\n125 = 2.5 B \u2192 B = 125 / 2.5. Let's calculate that. 125 divided by 2.5. Well, 2.5 times 50 is 125, so B is 50. So, 50 files are infected by both.\n\nThen, since W = 3.5 * B, W = 3.5 *50 = 175. So, 175 files are infected by a worm. But wait, the number of files infected only by a worm is W - B = 175 -50=125, which matches the earlier statement. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the question is asking: How many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm? So, files not infected by a worm would be those that are only virus-infected. Because if a file isn't infected by a worm, it must have been infected by a virus only, since all are infected by at least one.\n\nSo, the number of files infected only by a virus is V - B. We need to find that.\n\nWait, how do we find V? Because we know that the total number of files is 250, and all are infected by either virus or worm or both. So, the total is V + W - B = 250. Because V includes the overlap, W includes the overlap, so subtracting B to avoid double-counting.\n\nWe can plug in the values we have. V + W - B =250. We know W is 175, B is 50. So:\n\nV + 175 -50 = 250 \u2192 V + 125 =250 \u2192 V = 125.\n\nSo, V is 125. That means the number of files infected only by a virus is V - B =125 -50=75.\n\nWait, but wait, earlier I thought that the 125 files not infected by a virus are the ones only worm. And since V is 125, that makes sense because V is 125, which includes the 50 that are also worm. So, only virus is 75, and only worm is 125.\n\nSo, the question is how many files were NOT infected by a worm. That would be the number of files not in W, which is the only virus group. Which is 75.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 75. So, the answer should be C.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recap:\n\nTotal files:250.\n\nAll infected by V or W or both.\n\nOnly worm: 125 (since 50% not V \u2192 125 not V \u2192 only W).\n\nW - B =125. Also, W - B=2.5 B \u2192 125=2.5 B \u2192 B=50.\n\nW=3.5 B =175.\n\nV + W - B =250 \u2192 V +175 -50=250 \u2192 V=125.\n\nOnly V is V - B=75.\n\nSo, not infected by worm: 75. So, option C.\n",

Let me break that down.\n\nLet me assign some variables to make this easier. Let's say:\n\n- Let V be the number of files infected by a virus.\n- Let W be the number of files infected by a worm.\n- Let B be the number of files infected by both virus and worm.\n- Let W_only be the number of files infected only by worm.

So W_only = 2.5 * B.\n\nAnother part of the problem says that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. Wait, so 50% of 250 is 125 files. Those 125 are not infected by a virus. Which means they must be infected by a worm only, right? Because the files are either infected by virus, worm, or both. So if they're not infected by a virus, they must be infected by a worm, but not by a virus. So that would be the W_only files.\n\nWait, so W_only is 125. Because those 125 files are the ones not infected by a virus, so they can't be in the V category. So W_only = 125.\n\nBut earlier, we have W_only = 2.5 * B. So substituting, 125 = 2.5 * B. Let me solve for B.\n\nDivide both sides by 2.5: 125 / 2.5 = B. 125 divided by 2.5... 2.5 times 50 is 125, so B=50.\n\nSo the number of files infected by both is 50.\n\nNow, the question is asking how many files were NOT infected by a worm. Wait, no, wait: the question is asking for files NOT infected by a worm. But all files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. So files not infected by a worm must be files only infected by virus.\n\nWait, because if a file is infected by a virus, it could also be infected by a worm, but if it's not infected by a worm, it's only in virus.\n\nWait, but the question is: how many were not infected by a worm. So that would be the number of files infected only by virus plus any files infected by neither. But wait, the problem states that all 250 files are infected by either virus or worm or both.

Because the union is V + W - B.\n\nWe know that W_only is 125, which is W - B =125. So W = B + 125. Since B is 50, W =50+125=175.\n\nSo W is 175.\n\nAnd V is... hmm, let's see. We can find V from other info.\n\nWait, the problem says that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. So 50% of 250 is 125. So 125 files are not infected by a virus. Which means that the number of files infected by a virus is 250 -125 =125. So V =125.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because V is the total number of files infected by a virus, which includes those infected only by virus (V_only) and those infected by both (B). So V = V_only + B.\n\nSince V is 125 and B is 50, then V_only = 125 -50=75.\n\nSo the number of files not infected by a worm is V_only, which is 75.\n\nSo looking at the options, option C is 75.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps.\n\n1.

So the answer is C)75.\n\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Total Files**: There are 250 files in total, and all of them are infected by either a virus, a worm, or both. This means there are no files outside the union of virus and worm infections.\n\n2. **Files Not Infected by a Virus**: The problem states that 50% of the files are not infected by a virus. Since there are 250 files, 50% of 250 is:\n   \\[\n   0.5 \\times 250 = 125\n   \\]\n   These 125 files are not infected by a virus, so they must be infected only by a worm.\n\n3. **Relationship Between Worm-Only and Both Infections**: The problem states that the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. Let \\( B \\) represent the number of files infected by both. Then:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Worm-Only} = 2.5 \\times B\n   \\]\n   Since the worm-only files are 125:\n   \\[\n   125 = 2.5 \\times B \\implies B = \\frac{125}{2.5} = 50\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Worm-Infected Files**: The total number of worm-infected files includes both worm-only files and files infected by both. Thus:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Worm-Infected} = \\text{Worm-Only} + B = 125 + 50 = 175\n   \\]\n\n5. **Total Virus-Infected Files**: The problem states that 50% of the files are not infected by a virus, so the number of virus-infected files is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Virus-Infected} = 250 - 125 = 125\n   \\]\n\n6. **Files Infected Only by Virus**: The number of files infected only by a virus is the total virus-infected files minus the files infected by both:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Virus-Only} = \\text{Total Virus-Infected} - B = 125 - 50 = 75\n   \\]\n\n7. **Files Not Infected by a Worm**: Files not infected by a worm are those infected only by a virus. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Files Not Infected by a Worm} = \\text{Virus-Only} = 75\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of files not infected by a worm is **75**, which corresponds to option **C**.\n\nAnswer: C",
