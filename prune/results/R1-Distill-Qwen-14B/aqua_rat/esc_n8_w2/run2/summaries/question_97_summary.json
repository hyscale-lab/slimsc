      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a wire shaped into a rectangle, and then being rebent into a square. I'm trying to figure out the length of each side of the square. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the wire is in the shape of a rectangle. The length is given as 27 cm and the breadth as 17 cm. Wait, I remember that the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all the sides. So the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + breadth). Let me plug in the numbers: 2*(27 + 17). \n\nLet me compute that. 27 plus 17 is 44, right? So 2 times 44 is 88 cm. So the perimeter of the rectangle is 88 cm. Since the wire is being rebent into a square, the perimeter of the square should be the same as the rectangle's perimeter because the wire's length doesn't change. Oh, that makes sense.\n\nNow, a square has four sides of equal length. So the perimeter of the square is 4 times the length of one side. Let me denote the side of the square as 's'. So, 4s = perimeter, which is 88 cm. To find 's', I divide 88 by 4. \n\nCalculating that, 88 divided by 4 is 22. So each side of the square should be 22 cm long. Let me double-check my calculations. 27 plus 17 is 44, multiplied by 2 is 88. Divided by 4, that's 22. Yep, that looks right.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 22. So the correct answer should be C.\n",
