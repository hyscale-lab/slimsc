      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the percentage of students who passed the test based on their averages. Hmm, let's think. The passing students had an average of 83, and the failing ones averaged 55. The overall class average is 76. I guess I need to figure out what proportion of the class is passing and failing to get that 76 average.\n\nWait, this seems like a weighted average problem. Oh right, because the overall average depends on how many students passed and failed. Let me try to set this up. Let's say the number of passing students is P and the number of failing students is F. The total number of students would then be P + F.\n\nThe total points for passers would be 83 multiplied by P, and the total for failers would be 55 multiplied by F. So the overall average is the total points divided by total students. That gives the equation:\n\n(83P + 55F) / (P + F) = 76\n\nHmm, okay, I can work with that. Let me rearrange this equation. Multiply both sides by (P + F) to get rid of the denominator.\n\n83P + 55F = 76(P + F)\n\nExpanding the right side: 76P + 76F.\n\nSo, 83P +55F =76P +76F\n\nLet me subtract 76P and 55F from both sides to get the variables on one side.\n\n83P -76P =76F -55F\n7P =21F\n\nSimplify that. 7P =21F. Dividing both sides by 7 gives P =3F. So P is three times F. That means the number of passing students is three times the number of failing students.\n\nWait, but I need to find the percentage of the class that passed. The class is P + F. So if P =3F, then total students are 3F + F =4F.\n\nSo the percentage that passed is (P / total) *100. Since P is 3F, and total is 4F, that's (3F)/(4F) = 3/4. Oh wait, 3/4 is 75%. But wait, the options don't have 75% as the answer. Wait, looking back at the options, E is 75%.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake. Let me go through it again.\n\nEquation: 83P +55F =76(P + F)\n\n83P +55F =76P +76F\n\nSubtract 76P and 55F from both sides:\n\n83P -76P =76F -55F \u2192 7P =21F \u2192 P =3F.\n\nSo P is three times F. So the ratio of passers to total is 3/(3+1) = 3/4 =75%. So that would be option E. But wait, the options don't have E as the correct answer? Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are: A)44%, B)66%, C)68%, D)72%, E)75%.\n\nSo E is 75%, so that's the answer. But wait, the problem says \"what percent of the class passed\", which is P/(P+F)*100%. Which is 3F/(4F) =75%. So yes, E is correct.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial equation. Let me check. The overall average is 76, which is between 55 and 83. Since 76 is closer to 55, does that mean more students failed? Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. Hmm, maybe I messed up the equation.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: if more students passed, their higher average would pull the overall average up. Wait, in this case, the overall average is 76, which is closer to 55 than 83. So maybe more students failed, which would bring the average down.\n\nBut according to my calculation, P is three times F. So 3F passers, F failers. So 3:1 ratio of passers to failers. So the majority passed, which would make sense why the average is 76, which is closer to 83 than to 55. Because 76 is 83-7=7 away from 83 and 76-55=21 away from 55. Wait, no, that's not correct. 76 is 83 minus 7, so 7 away from 83, and 21 above 55. So actually, 76 is closer to 83 than to 55. Because 7 is less than 21. So if the average is closer to the passers' average, that suggests more students passed. Which aligns with my earlier conclusion that 75% passed. So that makes sense.\n\nBut wait, the options include 75%, which is E. So the correct answer should be E. But looking back, the initial problem statement says that the overall average is 76. Let me recheck my algebra.\n\nEquation: (83P +55F)/(P + F) =76\n\nMultiply both sides: 83P +55F =76P +76F\n\nSubtract 76P and 55F: 7P =21F \u2192 P=3F.\n\nSo yes, that's correct. So the percentage is 75%, so E is the correct answer.\n",
