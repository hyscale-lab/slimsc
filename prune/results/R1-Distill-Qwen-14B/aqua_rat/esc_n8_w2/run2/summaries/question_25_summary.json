      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Bill and his bicycle. Hmm, let's see what it says. Bill usually averages about 15 mph on a normal day, but on a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. The question is asking how far he can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes. And I need to round the answer to the nearest hundredth. Alright, I'll break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should find out Bill's speed on a windy day. Since his normal speed is 15 mph and the wind reduces it by 4 mph, I subtract 4 from 15. Let me do that: 15 minus 4 equals 11 mph. So, on a windy day, Bill's speed is 11 mph.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The time given is 21 minutes. Oh right, speed is in hours, but the time here is in minutes. I need to convert that 21 minutes into hours because the speed is per hour. How do I do that? Well, I know that 60 minutes make an hour, so 21 minutes is 21/60 hours. Let me calculate that. 21 divided by 60 is... let's see, 21 divided by 60 is 0.35 hours. Because 60 times 0.35 is 21. So, yes, 0.35 hours.\n\nNow, to find the distance, I remember the formula: distance equals speed multiplied by time. So, I need to multiply Bill's speed on a windy day by the time he's been riding. That would be 11 mph multiplied by 0.35 hours. Let me compute that. 11 times 0.35... Hmm, 10 times 0.35 is 3.5, and 1 times 0.35 is 0.35, so adding those together gives 3.85 miles. Oh wait, but wait, that's the exact number. The problem says to round to the nearest hundredth, but 3.85 is already to the hundredth place. So, I guess that's the answer.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 2.85, D is 3.85, so that must be the correct choice. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nWait, 15 mph minus 4 is definitely 11. 21 minutes is 0.35 hours. 11 * 0.35 is 3.85. Yep, that seems right. So the answer should be D) 3.85 miles.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nBill's speed on a windy day is reduced by 4 mph from his usual 15 mph, giving a speed of 11 mph. The time traveled is 21 minutes, which is equivalent to 0.35 hours (since 21/60 = 0.35). Using the formula for distance, \\( \\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} \\), the distance traveled is \\( 11 \\times 0.35 = 3.85 \\) miles.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about Bill riding his bicycle. Hmm, let me read it again. Bill usually averages about 15 mph on a normal day. But on a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. The question is, how far can he travel on a windy day in 21 minutes? And I need to round to the nearest hundredth. The options are A to E.\n\nAlright, first, I need to figure out Bill's speed on a windy day. Normally he goes 15 mph, but it's reduced by 4 mph. So I subtract 4 from 15. Let me do that: 15 minus 4 is 11. So his speed is 11 mph on a windy day.\n\nNow, the time he's cycling is 21 minutes. Wait, but speed is in hours, right? So I need to convert 21 minutes into hours to match the units. Hmm, 60 minutes is 1 hour, so 21 minutes is 21/60 hours. Let me calculate that. 21 divided by 60. Let's see, 60 goes into 21 zero times. 60 into 210 is 3 times (3*60=180). So 0.35 hours? Wait, 21 divided by 60 equals 0.35. Yep, because 0.35 times 60 is 21. So 21 minutes is 0.35 hours.\n\nNow, distance equals speed multiplied by time. So his distance on a windy day would be 11 mph multiplied by 0.35 hours. Let me compute that. 11 * 0.35. Hmm, 10 times 0.35 is 3.5, and 1 times 0.35 is 0.35. So adding them together, 3.5 + 0.35 equals 3.85 miles. \n\nWait, but the options are A)2, B)2.25, C)3.25, D)3.85, E)2.85. So 3.85 is option D. So that's the answer. But wait, did I do all steps correctly?\n\nLet me double-check. Speed on a windy day is 15-4=11 mph. Time is 21 minutes, which is 21/60=0.35 hours. 11 * 0.35 = 3.85. Yep, that's correct. So the answer should be D.\n",
