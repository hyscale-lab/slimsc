      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about simple interest. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that professors borrowed Rs. 5000 from the university at simple interest. After 3 years, the university got Rs. 300 on interest. I need to find the rate of interest per annum. The options are A to E, with E being none of these.\n\nWait, I remember the formula for simple interest. Oh right, simple interest (SI) is calculated as SI = P * R * T, where P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest per annum, and T is the time in years. So I need to find R here.\n\nGiven values: P is 5000 Rs, SI is 300 Rs, and T is 3 years. So plugging into the formula, I can rearrange it to solve for R. Let's see, R = SI / (P * T). \n\nSo substituting the numbers: R = 300 / (5000 * 3). Let me calculate the denominator first. 5000 multiplied by 3 is 15,000. Then 300 divided by 15,000. Hmm, 300 divided by 15,000... let me compute that. 15,000 divided by 300 is 50, so 300 / 15,000 is 1/50, which is 0.02. So R is 0.02, which is 2%.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 2%. So that would be the answer. But wait, let me double-check my calculation to be sure. \n\n5000 * 3 is 15,000, right. 300 divided by 15,000. Let me do it another way: 300 divided by 15,000 equals (300/1000) divided by 15. Which is 0.3 divided by 15, which is 0.02. Yep, that's 2%. So the rate is 2% per annum. So the correct answer is A.\n\nI think that's right. There's no trick here, it's straightforward. So I don't think any of the other options make sense. Option C is 5%, which would be if the interest was 5000 * 5% *3 = 750, which is way more than 300. So yeah, A is correct.\n",

We need to find the rate of interest per annum.\n\nWait, wait. Wait. Wait a second. Wait, the professor borrowed money, so the principal is Rs. 5000. The interest is the amount the professor paid back, right? Or is it the other way around? Hmm, no, wait. If the professor borrowed the money, they would pay interest on it. So the Rs. 300 is the interest the professor paid over 3 years. So the principal is 5000, time is 3 years, interest is 300.
