      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about marbles, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nAlright, the setup is that there's a bag with only white marbles. Then, 20 marbles are pulled out, painted black, and put back into the bag. So, now the bag has 20 more black marbles than before. Then, another 20 marbles are pulled out, and among those, 1 is black. After that, they're all returned to the bag. The question says that the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag. We need to find the total number of marbles in the bag, Q.\n\nHmm, okay. So let's break this down. Let me try to model the situation mathematically.\n\nFirst, let's think about the initial state. The bag only has white marbles. Let's say the total number of marbles in the bag before any were painted is N. Wait, wait, no, wait. Because the first step is pulling out 20, painting them, and putting them back. So after that first step, the bag has N + 20 marbles, right? Because we took out 20, painted them black, and returned them. So the total is now N plus 20 marbles. But wait, wait. Wait a minute, no. Because when you take marbles out and put them back, the total remains the same. Oh wait, no. Because when you take 20 marbles out, paint them, and put them back, the total number of marbles in the bag remains N. Because you took 20 out, painted, and returned them. So the initial number is N, then you take 20, make them black, and put them back. So the total is still N marbles, but now 20 of them are black, and the rest (N-20) are white.\n\nWait, wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the initial bag has only white marbles. So, when you pull out 20, paint them black, and put them back, the bag now has 20 black marbles and (N - 20) white marbles, right? Because you took 20 white marbles out, painted them, and returned them, so now those 20 are black. So the total number of marbles in the bag is still N.\n\nWait, but wait, that can't be correct because if you take 20 marbles out, paint them, and put them back, the total number of marbles is the same as before. So, the initial number of marbles in the bag is, let's say, Q. But after taking 20, painting, and putting back, the total is still Q, but now Q marbles include 20 black marbles and (Q-20) white marbles.\n\nThen, the second step: pulling out another 20 marbles. Out of these 20, 1 is black. So the proportion of black marbles pulled in the second draw is 1/20, which is 5%. The problem states that this percentage represents their percentage in the bag. So the percentage of black marbles in the bag after the first step must be 5%.\n\nWait, no. Because when you pull 20 marbles, and 1 is black, that means that in the entire bag, the proportion of black marbles is equal to 1/20, which is 5%. So, the percentage of black marbles in the bag is 5%.\n\nWait, but let me think. The second time, you pulled 20 marbles, and 1 was black. So the proportion of black marbles in the entire bag is equal to the proportion pulled, which is 1/20. So the percentage is (1/20)*100% =5%.\n\nSo, the bag has a 5% black marbles after the first step. So, the number of black marbles in the bag is 5% of the total marbles in the bag.\n\nBut wait, after the first step, the bag has 20 black marbles and (Q - 20) white marbles, making the total marbles Q again. Wait, no, that's not right. Because after the first step, the total marbles are Q (same as before), but 20 are black. So the percentage of black marbles is (20 / Q) * 100% = 2000 / Q %.\n\nWait, but according to the problem, after the second draw, the percentage is 5%, because 1 out of 20 drawn was black. So the percentage of black marbles in the bag must be 5%. So 20 / Q = 5% \u2192 20 = 0.05 * Q \u2192 Q = 20 / 0.05 \u2192 Q = 400.\n\nWait, so that would make the total number of marbles Q equal to 400. Let me double-check.\n\nSo, initial state: Q marbles, all white.\n\nAfter first step: 20 marbles are painted black and put back. So total marbles in the bag are still Q, with 20 black and (Q-20) white.\n\nSecond step: pulling 20 marbles. The proportion of black marbles in the bag is 20/Q. The probability of pulling a black marble is 20/Q. So when we pulled 20 marbles, the expected number of black marbles is 20 * (20/Q).\n\nBut in reality, we pulled 1 black marble. So the observed number is 1. The problem states that the percentage of black marbles pulled (1/20) equals the percentage in the bag. So, the percentage in the bag is (20 / Q) * 100% = (1/20)*100% =5%. So 20/Q = 5% \u2192 20 = 0.05 Q \u2192 Q=400.\n\nSo the total marbles in the bag is 400. So the answer is D) 400.\n",
