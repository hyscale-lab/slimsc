      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this probability problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked. The question is about two numbers being relatively prime. Oh right, relatively prime means they share no common positive factors other than 1. So, for example, 8 and 15 are relatively prime because their only common factor is 1.\n\nThe problem says we have a set S which contains integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive. We're supposed to find the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000. The options are given as fractions, so I need to calculate this probability as a fraction.\n\nHmm, probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. The total outcomes here are easy: there are 1,000 numbers in set S. So the denominator of the probability will be 1,000. The numerator is the count of numbers in S that are relatively prime to 1,000.\n\nWait, how do I find how many numbers between 1 and 1000 are relatively prime to 1000? Oh, I think this has to do with Euler's Totient Function, \u03c6(n). Euler's Totient Function gives the number of integers less than or equal to n that are coprime to n. So \u03c6(1000) should give me the count I need.\n\nRight, Euler's Totient Function. Let me recall how to compute it. The formula for \u03c6(n) when n is a product of prime factors is n multiplied by the product of (1 - 1/p) for each distinct prime p dividing n. So first, I need to factorize 1000 into its prime components.\n\n1000 is 10 cubed, which is (2*5)^3. So 1000 = 2^3 * 5^3. So the prime factors are 2 and 5. \n\nNow applying Euler's formula: \u03c6(1000) = 1000 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/5). Let me compute that. 1 - 1/2 is 1/2, and 1 - 1/5 is 4/5. So \u03c6(1000) = 1000 * (1/2) * (4/5).\n\nCalculating that step by step: 1000 * 1/2 is 500. Then 500 * 4/5 is... 500 * 4 is 2000, divided by 5 is 400. So \u03c6(1000) is 400. That means there are 400 numbers between 1 and 1000 that are coprime with 1000.\n\nWait, wait. Wait a second. Because 1000 is included in set S. But the Totient function counts numbers less than or equal to n that are coprime. So yes, that's correct. So 400 is the numerator.\n\nSo the probability is 400 / 1000. Simplifying that fraction: divide numerator and denominator by 200, which gives 2/5. Hmm, wait no, 400 divided by 1000 is 0.4, which is 2/5. So the probability is 2/5.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes when using \u03c6(n), it counts numbers less than or equal to n, but if n is 1000, then 1000 is included in the count. But 1000 is not coprime with itself because their GCD is 1000. So actually, \u03c6(1000) counts numbers from 1 to 1000 that are coprime to 1000. So that's correct. So 400 numbers.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate \u03c6(1000):\n\n1000 = 2^3 * 5^3.\n\n\u03c6(1000) = 1000 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/5) = 1000 * 1/2 * 4/5 = 1000 * (2/5) = 400. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the probability is 400/1000 = 2/5. Looking at the options, option D is 2/5. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, let me make sure. The options are:\n\nA)5/7\n\nB)3/5\n\nC)4/7\n\nD)2/5\n\nE)2/7\n\nSo D is 2/5, which matches our calculation. So the correct answer is D.\n",

Two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1.\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization of 1000\nThe prime factorization of 1000 is:\n\\[\n1000 = 2^3 \\times 5^3\n\\]\nThe prime factors are 2 and 5.\n\n### Step 2: Using Euler's Totient Function\nEuler's Totient Function, \\( \\phi(n) \\), gives the number of integers less than or equal to \\( n \\) that are coprime to \\( n \\). The formula for \\( \\phi(n) \\) when \\( n = p_1^{k_1} \\times p_2^{k_2} \\times \\dots \\times p_m^{k_m} \\) is:\n\\[\n\\phi(n) = n \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p_1}\\right) \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p_2}\\right) \\times \\dots \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p_m}\\right)\n\\]\nApplying this to \\( n = 1000 \\):\n\\[\n\\phi(1000) = 1000 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{5}\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\phi(1000) = 1000 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{5} = 1000 \\times \\frac{2}{5} = 400\n\\]\nThus, there are 400 numbers between 1 and 1000 that are coprime to 1000.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Probability\nThe probability is the number of favorable outcomes (coprime numbers) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (total numbers in \\( S \\)):\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of coprime numbers}}{\\text{Total numbers}} = \\frac{400}{1000} = \\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Verifying with Inclusion-Exclusion Principle\nTo confirm, we can use the inclusion-exclusion principle to count numbers not coprime to 1000:\n- Numbers divisible by 2: \\( \\frac{1000}{2} = 500 \\)\n- Numbers divisible by 5: \\( \\frac{1000}{5} = 200 \\)\n- Numbers divisible by both 2 and 5 (i.e., by 10): \\( \\frac{1000}{10} = 100 \\)\n\nUsing inclusion-exclusion:\n\\[\n\\text{Numbers not coprime to 1000} = (500 + 200) - 100 = 600\n\\]\nThus, numbers coprime to 1000:\n\\[\n1000 - 600 = 400\n\\]\nThis confirms that the probability is:\n\\[\n\\frac{400}{1000} = \\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe probability that a number chosen from \\( S \\) is relatively prime to 1000 is \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\).\n\nAnswer: D",
