      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about alloys made of zinc and copper. Let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nSo, the question says there are two alloys, X and Y. Alloy X has zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9. Alloy Y has them in 7:11. Then, they take 40 grams of X and 60 grams of Y, melt them, and mix them to form alloy Z. We need to find the ratio of zinc to copper in Z.\n\nHmm. Ratios can sometimes be tricky, but I think I can handle this by finding out how much zinc and copper each alloy contributes and then adding them up.\n\nLet me start by figuring out how much zinc and copper are in 40 grams of alloy X. The ratio is 6:9, which simplifies to 2:3. Wait, or maybe I should keep it as 6:9 for calculation purposes. Either way, I can find the amounts.\n\nSo, the total parts in X's ratio are 6 + 9 = 15 parts. So each part is 40 grams divided by 15 parts. Oh wait, no, that's not right. Because 40 grams is the total mass of the alloy, right? So each part is 40/15 grams.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. The ratio 6:9 is the same as 2:3. So for every 2 parts of zinc, there are 3 parts copper. So in alloy X, zinc is (2/5) of the alloy, and copper is (3/5). Let me confirm: 2+3=5, so yes.\n\nSo for 40 grams of X, zinc is (2/5)*40 = 16 grams. Copper is (3/5)*40 = 24 grams. Got that.\n\nNow, moving on to alloy Y. The ratio is 7:11. So total parts are 7 + 11 = 18 parts. So each part is 60 grams divided by 18. Wait, no, 60 is the total mass of Y. So again, zinc is 7 parts, copper 11 parts.\n\nSo, zinc in Y is (7/18)*60. Let's calculate that: 7 * (60/18) = 7 * (10/3) = 70/3 \u224823.333 grams. Copper would be (11/18)*60 = 11*(60/18) = 11*(10/3) = 110/3 \u224836.666 grams.\n\nWait, let me compute those exactly. 60 divided by 18 is 10/3. So 7 * 10/3 is 70/3, which is about 23.333 grams. And 11 *10/3 is 110/3, about 36.666 grams.\n\nNow, when they mix X and Y, the total zinc is 16 (from X) + 70/3 (from Y). Similarly, the total copper is 24 + 110/3.\n\nLet me compute the totals.\n\nZinc: 16 + (70/3). To add these, I can write 16 as 48/3. So 48/3 +70/3= 118/3 grams.\n\nCopper: 24 + (110/3). 24 is 72/3. So 72/3 + 110/3 = 182/3 grams.\n\nSo now, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is (118/3) : (182/3). The denominators are the same, so they cancel out. So it's 118:182.\n\nWait, can I simplify this ratio? Let me see. Both numbers are even, so divide by 2: 59:91. Oh, that's one of the options.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D is 59:91. Option B is 59:91 as well? Wait, let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA)69:91\nB)59:91\nC)59:90\nD)59:91\nE)69:101\n\nWait, both B and D are 59:91. That can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the initial ratios. Let me double-check.\n\nAlloy X: 6:9 \u2192 that's zinc to copper. So 6 parts Zn, 9 parts Cu.\n\n40 grams of X. So each part is 40/(6+9) = 40/15 = 8/3 grams.\n\nSo Zn in X: 6 * (8/3) = 48/3 = 16 grams. Correct.\n\nCu in X:9*(8/3)=72/3=24 grams. Correct.\n\nAlloy Y: 7:11 \u2192 Zn:Cu.\n\n60 grams of Y. Each part is 60/(7+11)=60/18=10/3 grams.\n\nZn in Y:7*(10/3)=70/3\u224823.333 grams.\n\nCu in Y:11*(10/3)=110/3\u224836.666 grams.\n\nTotal Zn:16 +70/3 = (48 +70)/3 = 118/3.\n\nTotal Cu:24 +110/3 = (72 +110)/3 = 182/3.\n\nSo ratio Zn:Cu is 118/3 : 182/3 \u2192 118:182 \u2192 divide numerator and denominator by 2 \u2192 59:91.\n\nSo the ratio is 59:91.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 59:91, and option B is same. Wait, no, let me check the options again. Oh wait, the options are:\n\nA)69:91\nB)59:91\nC)59:90\nD)59:91\nE)69:101\n\nWait, options B and D are the same? That can't be right. Did I read the options correctly? Let me look again.\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nWait, the options are A to E. Looking at the user's original message, options B and D are both 59:91. That's an error, but perhaps in the actual problem, perhaps they are different. But in the given problem, B and D are same. So perhaps the correct option is D, assuming a typo.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscalculated. Let me go through the steps again.\n\nWait, 40 grams of X: 6:9 ratio.\n\nTotal parts 15.\n\nZn: (6/15)*40 = (2/5)*40 = 16 grams.\n\nCu: (9/15)*40=24 grams.\n\nY is 60 grams, ratio 7:11.\n\nTotal parts 18.\n\nZn: (7/18)*60 = (70/3) \u224823.333 grams.\n\nCu: (11/18)*60 = (110/3) \u224836.666 grams.\n\nTotal Zn: 16 + 70/3 = (48 +70)/3 = 118/3.\n\nTotal Cu:24 +110/3 = (72 + 110)/3 = 182/3.\n\nRatio: (118/3)/(182/3) = 118/182 = 59/91 \u2192 59:91.\n\nSo the answer is 59:91. Now, looking at the options, both B and D are the same. So perhaps one of them is a typo, but in the options provided, both are same. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial ratio of alloy X.\n\nWait, the problem says X is made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9. So zinc is 6 parts, copper 9 parts. So the ratio of Zn to Cu is 6:9, which simplifies to 2:3. So that part is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratios are of copper to zinc instead of zinc to copper. Wait, that could be a mistake. Let me check the question again.\n\nQuestion says: X and Y are made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. So the first number is zinc, second is copper. So for X, 6 parts Zn to 9 parts Cu. So the calculation is correct.\n\nSo the answer should be 59:91, which is options B and D. But since they're same, perhaps the intended correct answer is D. Or perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the math again.\n\n118:182 \u2192 divide numerator and denominator by 2 \u2192 59:91. That's correct.\n\nSo looking at the options, both B and D are 59:91. That's an error in the options. But perhaps the correct option is D.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, perhaps I misread the letters. Let me check again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nAh, so options B and D are the same. That's probably a mistake in the problem setup. So the correct ratio is 59:91, so the correct options are B and D. But since only one can be correct, perhaps D is the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the mass percentages again.\n\nWait, in X, 40 grams. Zn is 16g, Cu 24g.\n\nIn Y, 60 grams. Zn is 70/3 \u224823.333g, Cu 110/3 \u224836.666g.\n\nTotal Zn: 16 + 70/3 = (48 +70)/3 = 118/3 \u224839.333g.\n\nTotal Cu:24 + 110/3 = (72 +110)/3 = 182/3 \u224860.666g.\n\nSo Zn is about 39.333 grams, Cu about 60.666 grams. Total mass is 100 grams (40+60=100).\n\nSo the ratio is 39.333 : 60.666. Let me write them as fractions: 118/3 : 182/3.\n\nWhich is the same as 118:182 \u2192 59:91.\n\nSo the ratio is 59:91.\n\nThus, the correct answer is 59:91, which is either option B or D. But since the options have both as same, perhaps the correct choice is D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about alloys made of zinc and copper. Let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nSo, the question says there are two alloys, X and Y.

Either way, I can find the amounts.\n\nSo, the total parts in X's ratio are 6 + 9 = 15 parts. So each part is 40 grams divided by 15 parts. Oh wait, no, that's not right. Because 40 grams is the total mass of the alloy, right? So each part is 40/15 grams.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. The ratio 6:9 is the same as 2:3. So for every 2 parts of zinc, there are 3 parts copper. So in alloy X, zinc is (2/5) of the alloy, and copper is (3/5). Let me confirm: 2+3=5, so yes.\n\nSo for 40 grams of X, zinc is (2/5)*40 = 16 grams. Copper is (3/5)*40 = 24 grams. Got that.\n\nNow, moving on to alloy Y. The ratio is 7:11. So total parts are 7 + 11 = 18 parts. So each part is 60 grams divided by 18. Wait, no, 60 is the total mass of Y. So again, zinc is 7 parts, copper 11 parts.\n\nSo, zinc in Y is (7/18)*60. Let's calculate that: 7 * (60/18) = 7 * (10/3) = 70/3 \u224823.333 grams. Copper would be (11/18)*60 = 11*(60/18) = 11*(10/3) = 110/3 \u224836.666 grams.\n\nWait, let me compute those exactly. 60 divided by 18 is 10/3. So 7 * 10/3 is 70/3, which is about 23.333 grams. And 11 *10/3 is 110/3, about 36.666 grams.\n\nNow, when they mix X and Y, the total zinc is 16 (from X) + 70/3 (from Y). Similarly, the total copper is 24 + 110/3.\n\nLet me compute the totals.\n\nZinc: 16 + (70/3). To add these, I can write 16 as 48/3. So 48/3 +70/3= 118/3 grams.\n\nCopper: 24 + (110/3). 24 is 72/3. So 72/3 + 110/3 = 182/3 grams.\n\nSo now, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is (118/3) : (182/3). The denominators are the same, so they cancel out. So it's 118:182.\n\nWait, can I simplify this ratio? Let me see. Both numbers are even, so divide by 2: 59:91. Oh, that's one of the options.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D is 59:91.

Hmm, alloys X and Y have different ratios, and I need to find the ratio in alloy Z after mixing some of X and Y. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the problem again carefully. Alloy X is made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9. Wait, that's 6 parts zinc to 9 parts copper. Oh wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, when they say ratio 6:9, does that mean zinc to copper? I think so, because the order matters. So for X, the ratio is 6:9, meaning for every 6 units of zinc, there are 9 units of copper.\n\nSimilarly, alloy Y has a ratio of 7:11. So that's 7 parts zinc to 11 parts copper. Got it.\n\nNow, they take 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y and mix them to form alloy Z. I need to find the ratio of zinc to copper in Z.\n\nHmm, so probably I should find the amount of zinc and copper in each of X and Y, add them up, and then find the new ratio.\n\nLet me think about alloy X first. The ratio is 6:9, which can be simplified. Wait, 6:9 is the same as 2:3. So for every 5 parts of alloy X, 2 parts are zinc and 3 parts are copper. But wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of fractions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate the mass of zinc and copper in each alloy.\n\nSo for alloy X: the ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9, which is equivalent to 2:3. The total parts are 2+3 =5. So zinc is (2/5) of the alloy, and copper is (3/5).\n\nSince we're taking 40 grams of X, the zinc in X is (2/5)*40 = 16 grams. And copper is (3/5)*40 =24 grams.\n\nSimilarly for alloy Y: the ratio is 7:11. So total parts are 7+11=18. So zinc is (7/18) of Y, and copper is (11/18).\n\nWe're taking 60 grams of Y, so zinc in Y is (7/18)*60. Let me compute that. 7 times 60 is 420, divided by 18. Let's see, 420/18 is 23.333... grams. Hmm, which is 23 and 1/3 grams.\n\nCopper in Y is (11/18)*60. 11 times 60 is 660, divided by 18. 660/18 is 36.666... grams, which is 36 and 2/3 grams.\n\nSo now, let's sum up the zinc and copper from both X and Y.\n\nZinc total: 16 (from X) + 23.333... (from Y) = 39.333... grams.\n\nCopper total:24 (from X) + 36.666... (from Y) = 60.666... grams.\n\nWait, let me double-check those calculations.\n\nFor X: 40g * (2/5) = 16g Zn, 24g Cu. Correct.\n\nY: 60g * (7/18) = (60/18)*7. 60/18 is 3.333..., so 3.333 *7 is 23.333g Zn. And 60*(11/18) is 60/18=3.333 *11=36.666g Cu. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo total Zn is 16 +23.333=39.333g. Cu is 24+36.666=60.666g.\n\nNow, to find the ratio of Zn to Cu in Z. So 39.333 : 60.666.\n\nHmm, I can write these as fractions to make it easier. Let's see:\n\n39.333 is approximately 118/3 grams. Because 39.333 is 39 and 1/3, which is 118/3.\n\n60.666 is approximately 182/3 grams. Because 60.666 is 60 and 2/3, which is 182/3.\n\nWait, wait. Let me compute exactly. 39.333... is 118/3, because 118 divided by 3 is 39.333.\n\nSimilarly, 60.666 is 182/3, because 182 divided by 3 is 60.666...\n\nSo the ratio is (118/3) : (182/3). The denominators are the same, so they cancel out.\n\nSo the ratio is 118 : 182.\n\nWait, can I simplify this ratio? Let's see. Both numbers are even, so divide by 2: 59:91.\n\nWait, 118 \u00f72 is 59, 182 \u00f72 is 91. So the ratio is 59:91.\n\nLooking at the options, let's see.\n\nOptions:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nWait, options B and D are the same? Let me check the options again. Wait, the user wrote:\n\nOptions:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nWait, so options B and D are same? That's a problem because the correct answer is 59:91, which would be both B and D. But that's not possible. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me recheck the calculations. Maybe I messed up the initial ratios.\n\nWait, the problem says alloy X is zinc and copper in ratio 6:9. So 6 parts zinc, 9 parts copper. So total parts 15? Wait, wait, no, 6+9=15? No, wait, 6+9 is 15? Oh wait, 6+9 is 15? No, 6+9 is 15? Wait, 6+9=15. Oh yes, so each part is 1 gram? No, wait, the parts are ratios, not actual grams.\n\nSo for alloy X, 40 grams is divided into 6+9=15 parts. So each part is 40/15 grams. So zinc is 6 parts: 6*(40/15) = 16 grams. Copper is 9 parts:9*(40/15)=24 grams. So that's correct.\n\nFor alloy Y, 7:11. 7+11=18 parts. So 60 grams divided into 18 parts. Each part is 60/18=3.333 grams. So zinc is 7*3.333=23.333 grams. Copper is 11*3.333=36.666 grams. Correct.\n\nSo adding zinc:16+23.333=39.333 grams.\n\nCopper:24+36.666=60.666 grams.\n\nSo the ratio is 39.333 : 60.666.\n\nWhich is 118/3 : 182/3 \u2192 118:182 \u2192 divide by 2 \u219259:91.\n\nSo the ratio is 59:91.\n\nLooking back at the options, options B and D are the same. Hmm, but the user provided the options, perhaps I should double-check.\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nWait, both B and D are same. That's a mistake in the question perhaps. But looking at the options, both B and D are 59:91. So perhaps the correct answer is either B or D. But in the options, D is the same as B. So maybe it's a typo, perhaps option D is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, 6:9 for X, which is 2:3. 40 grams. So Zn is 2/(2+3) *40=16g. Cu is 3/5 *40=24g. Correct.\n\nY is 7:11. 60 grams. So Zn is 7/(7+11)*60=7/18 *60=23.333g. Cu is 11/18 *60=36.666g. Correct.\n\nTotal Zn:16+23.333=39.333g. Cu:24+36.666=60.666g.\n\nSo the ratio is Zn:Cu = 39.333 :60.666.\n\nWhich simplifies to 59:91 as before.\n\nSo the correct ratio is 59:91. So the options B and D are the same, so I think the correct answer is either B or D. But looking at the options, perhaps D is the correct choice. Wait, let me check the options again.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo. Looking back, the options were:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nWait, so B and D are the same. Hmm, that's a problem. But in any case, the correct answer is 59:91, so the answer should be option B or D. But perhaps the intended correct option is D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the ratio using the total parts. Let me think of another approach.\n\nThe total mass of alloy Z is 40+60=100 grams. So Z is 100g.\n\nIn X, the proportion of Zn is 6/(6+9)=6/15=2/5. So 40g * 2/5=16g Zn.\n\nIn Y, the proportion of Zn is7/(7+11)=7/18. 60g *7/18=23.333g.\n\nTotal Zn:16+23.333=39.333g.\n\nSimilarly, Cu is 100g - Zn, so 60.666g.\n\nSo 39.333:60.666 \u2192 59:91.\n\nSo the correct answer is 59:91, which is option B and D. But since the options have B and D as the same, perhaps the intended correct option is B. But I'm not sure why both B and D are same. Maybe it's a mistake, but in any case, the correct answer is 59:91, which is present in options B and D.\n\nBut looking at the options, perhaps D is the correct one. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute the totals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should express the fractions as exact numbers instead of decimals.\n\nZn from X: (6/15)*40 = (2/5)*40=16g.\n\nZn from Y: (7/18)*60 = (7*60)/18 = (420)/18=23.333...g.\n\nSo Zn total:16 + 23.333=39.333g.\n\nCu from X: (9/15)*40 = (3/5)*40=24g.\n\nCu from Y: (11/18)*60= (660)/18=36.666g.\n\nTotal Cu:24 +36.666=60.666g.\n\nSo the ratio is 39.333 :60.666. Multiply both by 3 to eliminate denominators.\n\n39.333 *3=118, 60.666*3=182.\n\nSo 118:182 \u2192 dividing by 2 \u219259:91.\n\nSo the ratio is 59:91, which is option B and D. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is option D. Because sometimes in multiple-choice questions, the same option might be duplicated, but perhaps the correct one is D. Or perhaps the options are correct, and I should choose the first occurrence, which is B.\n\nBut according to the options, both B and D are the same. So perhaps it's a typo. But in any case, the correct answer is 59:91, so either B or D.\n\nLooking at the options again, I see that option D is also 59:91, so perhaps the correct answer is D. But I'm not sure why both B and D are same. Maybe the question has a mistake. However, the correct ratio is 59:91, so the answer is either B or D.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the options again. Let me read the options as given:\n\nOptions:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nSo options B and D are same. So perhaps the correct answer is D, but I can't be sure. However, the calculation leads to 59:91, so the answer is either B or D.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are meant to be unique. So perhaps the correct option is D, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved by considering the fractions of each component.\n\nAnother approach: find the amount of zinc and copper in each alloy, then combine.\n\nAlloy X: 6:9 \u2192 2:3.\n\n40g \u2192 2x +3x =5x =40 \u2192x=8. So 2x=16g Zn, 3x=24g Cu.\n\nAlloy Y:7:11.\n\n60g \u21927y +11y=18y=60 \u2192 y=60/18=10/3 \u22483.333g.\n\nSo Zn in Y:7y=7*(10/3)=70/3 \u224823.333g.\n\nCu in Y:11y=110/3 \u224836.666g.\n\nSo total Zn=16 +70/3= (48/3 +70/3)=118/3 \u224839.333g.\n\nTotal Cu=24 +110/3= (72/3 +110/3)=182/3 \u224860.666g.\n\nRatio Zn:Copper= (118/3) : (182/3) =118:182=59:91.\n\nSo yes, the same result. So the answer is 59:91.\n\nLooking at the options, that's options B and D. So perhaps the correct choice is D. But I'm not sure why both B and D are same. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and the intended correct option is B.\n\nBut regardless, the correct ratio is 59:91, so the answer is either B or D. Since both are same, perhaps the correct choice is B, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to choose D. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for any possible miscalculations again.\n\nWait, 6:9 is 2:3. 40g \u2192 2 parts are 16g, 3 parts 24g. Correct.\n\n7:11. 60g \u2192 each part is 60/18=3.333g. So 7 parts:23.333g, 11 parts:36.666g. Correct.\n\nAdding, Zn=16+23.333=39.333, Cu=24+36.666=60.666.\n\nRatio 39.333 :60.666 = (118/3) : (182/3) \u2192 118:182 \u2192 59:91.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo the answer is 59:91. So among the options, both B and D are correct. But since the options have the same, perhaps the correct answer is either B or D. But in the options, D is the same as B. Hmm, perhaps it's a mistake in the options. But the correct ratio is 59:91.\n",

And copper is (3/5)*40 =24 grams.\n\nSimilarly for alloy Y: the ratio is 7:11. So total parts are 7+11=18. So zinc is (7/18) of Y, and copper is (11/18).\n\nWe're taking 60 grams of Y, so zinc in Y is (7/18)*60. Let me compute that. 7 times 60 is 420, divided by 18. Let's see, 420/18 is 23.333... grams. Hmm, which is 23 and 1/3 grams.\n\nCopper in Y is (11/18)*60. 11 times 60 is 660, divided by 18. 660/18 is 36.666... grams, which is 36 and 2/3 grams.\n\nSo now, let's sum up the zinc and copper from both X and Y.\n\nZinc total: 16 (from X) + 23.333...

Let me compute exactly. 39.333... is 118/3, because 118 divided by 3 is 39.333.\n\nSimilarly, 60.666 is 182/3, because 182 divided by 3 is 60.666...\n\nSo the ratio is (118/3) : (182/3).

Maybe I messed up the initial ratios.\n\nWait, the problem says alloy X is zinc and copper in ratio 6:9. So 6 parts zinc, 9 parts copper. So total parts 15? Wait, wait, no, 6+9=15? No, wait, 6+9 is 15? Oh wait, 6+9 is 15? No, 6+9 is 15? Wait, 6+9=15. Oh yes, so each part is 1 gram? No, wait, the parts are ratios, not actual grams.\n\nSo for alloy X, 40 grams is divided into 6+9=15 parts. So each part is 40/15 grams. So zinc is 6 parts: 6*(40/15) = 16 grams. Copper is 9 parts:9*(40/15)=24 grams. So that's correct.\n\nFor alloy Y, 7:11. 7+11=18 parts. So 60 grams divided into 18 parts. Each part is 60/18=3.333 grams. So zinc is 7*3.333=23.333 grams. Copper is 11*3.333=36.666 grams. Correct.\n\nSo adding zinc:16+23.333=39.333 grams.\n\nCopper:24+36.666=60.666 grams.\n\nSo the ratio is 39.333 : 60.666.\n\nWhich is 118/3 : 182/3 \u2192 118:182 \u2192 divide by 2 \u219259:91.\n\nSo the ratio is 59:91.\n\nLooking back at the options, options B and D are the same.

So maybe it's a typo, perhaps option D is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, 6:9 for X, which is 2:3. 40 grams. So Zn is 2/(2+3) *40=16g. Cu is 3/5 *40=24g. Correct.\n\nY is 7:11. 60 grams. So Zn is 7/(7+11)*60=7/18 *60=23.333g. Cu is 11/18 *60=36.666g. Correct.\n\nTotal Zn:16+23.333=39.333g. Cu:24+36.666=60.666g.\n\nSo the ratio is Zn:Cu = 39.333 :60.666.\n\nWhich simplifies to 59:91 as before.\n\nSo the correct ratio is 59:91. So the options B and D are the same, so I think the correct answer is either B or D. But looking at the options, perhaps D is the correct choice. Wait, let me check the options again.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo. Looking back, the options were:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nWait, so B and D are the same. Hmm, that's a problem. But in any case, the correct answer is 59:91, so the answer should be option B or D. But perhaps the intended correct option is D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the ratio using the total parts. Let me think of another approach.\n\nThe total mass of alloy Z is 40+60=100 grams. So Z is 100g.\n\nIn X, the proportion of Zn is 6/(6+9)=6/15=2/5. So 40g * 2/5=16g Zn.\n\nIn Y, the proportion of Zn is7/(7+11)=7/18. 60g *7/18=23.333g.\n\nTotal Zn:16+23.333=39.333g.\n\nSimilarly, Cu is 100g - Zn, so 60.666g.\n\nSo 39.333:60.666 \u2192 59:91.\n\nSo the correct answer is 59:91, which is option B and D. But since the options have B and D as the same, perhaps the intended correct option is B. But I'm not sure why both B and D are same. Maybe it's a mistake, but in any case, the correct answer is 59:91, which is present in options B and D.\n\nBut looking at the options, perhaps D is the correct one. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute the totals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should express the fractions as exact numbers instead of decimals.\n\nZn from X: (6/15)*40 = (2/5)*40=16g.\n\nZn from Y: (7/18)*60 = (7*60)/18 = (420)/18=23.333...g.\n\nSo Zn total:16 + 23.333=39.333g.\n\nCu from X: (9/15)*40 = (3/5)*40=24g.\n\nCu from Y: (11/18)*60= (660)/18=36.666g.\n\nTotal Cu:24 +36.666=60.666g.\n\nSo the ratio is 39.333 :60.666. Multiply both by 3 to eliminate denominators.\n\n39.333 *3=118, 60.666*3=182.\n\nSo 118:182 \u2192 dividing by 2 \u219259:91.\n\nSo the ratio is 59:91, which is option B and D. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is option D. Because sometimes in multiple-choice questions, the same option might be duplicated, but perhaps the correct one is D. Or perhaps the options are correct, and I should choose the first occurrence, which is B.\n\nBut according to the options, both B and D are the same. So perhaps it's a typo. But in any case, the correct answer is 59:91, so either B or D.\n\nLooking at the options again, I see that option D is also 59:91, so perhaps the correct answer is D. But I'm not sure why both B and D are same. Maybe the question has a mistake. However, the correct ratio is 59:91, so the answer is either B or D.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the options again. Let me read the options as given:\n\nOptions:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nSo options B and D are same. So perhaps the correct answer is D, but I can't be sure. However, the calculation leads to 59:91, so the answer is either B or D.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are meant to be unique. So perhaps the correct option is D, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved by considering the fractions of each component.\n\nAnother approach: find the amount of zinc and copper in each alloy, then combine.\n\nAlloy X: 6:9 \u2192 2:3.\n\n40g \u2192 2x +3x =5x =40 \u2192x=8. So 2x=16g Zn, 3x=24g Cu.\n\nAlloy Y:7:11.\n\n60g \u21927y +11y=18y=60 \u2192 y=60/18=10/3 \u22483.333g.\n\nSo Zn in Y:7y=7*(10/3)=70/3 \u224823.333g.\n\nCu in Y:11y=110/3 \u224836.666g.\n\nSo total Zn=16 +70/3= (48/3 +70/3)=118/3 \u224839.333g.\n\nTotal Cu=24 +110/3= (72/3 +110/3)=182/3 \u224860.666g.\n\nRatio Zn:Copper= (118/3) : (182/3) =118:182=59:91.\n\nSo yes, the same result. So the answer is 59:91.\n\nLooking at the options, that's options B and D. So perhaps the correct choice is D. But I'm not sure why both B and D are same. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and the intended correct option is B.\n\nBut regardless, the correct ratio is 59:91, so the answer is either B or D. Since both are same, perhaps the correct choice is B, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to choose D. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for any possible miscalculations again.\n\nWait, 6:9 is 2:3. 40g \u2192 2 parts are 16g, 3 parts 24g. Correct.\n\n7:11. 60g \u2192 each part is 60/18=3.333g. So 7 parts:23.333g, 11 parts:36.666g. Correct.\n\nAdding, Zn=16+23.333=39.333, Cu=24+36.666=60.666.\n\nRatio 39.333 :60.666 = (118/3) : (182/3) \u2192 118:182 \u2192 59:91.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo the answer is 59:91. So among the options, both B and D are correct. But since the options have the same, perhaps the correct answer is either B or D. But in the options, D is the same as B. Hmm, perhaps it's a mistake in the options. But the correct ratio is 59:91.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we calculate the amount of zinc and copper in each alloy and then determine the ratio in the final alloy Z.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Alloy X\n- Alloy X has a zinc-to-copper ratio of **6:9**, which simplifies to **2:3**.\n- The total mass of alloy X is **40 g**.\n- Let the mass of zinc be \\( 2x \\) and copper be \\( 3x \\).  \n  \\[\n  2x + 3x = 40 \\implies 5x = 40 \\implies x = 8\n  \\]\n- Mass of zinc in X: \\( 2x = 2 \\times 8 = 16 \\, \\text{g} \\).  \n- Mass of copper in X: \\( 3x = 3 \\times 8 = 24 \\, \\text{g} \\).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Alloy Y\n- Alloy Y has a zinc-to-copper ratio of **7:11**.\n- The total mass of alloy Y is **60 g**.\n- Let the mass of zinc be \\( 7y \\) and copper be \\( 11y \\).  \n  \\[\n  7y + 11y = 60 \\implies 18y = 60 \\implies y = \\frac{60}{18} = \\frac{10}{3} \\approx 3.333\n  \\]\n- Mass of zinc in Y: \\( 7y = 7 \\times \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{70}{3} \\approx 23.333 \\, \\text{g} \\).  \n- Mass of copper in Y: \\( 11y = 11 \\times \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{110}{3} \\approx 36.666 \\, \\text{g} \\).\n\n### Step 3: Combine Alloys X and Y\n- Total mass of zinc in alloy Z:  \n  \\[\n  16 + 23.333 = 39.333 \\, \\text{g}.\n  \\]\n- Total mass of copper in alloy Z:  \n  \\[\n  24 + 36.666 = 60.666 \\, \\text{g}.\n  \\]\n\n### Step 4: Simplify the Ratio\n- The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{39.333}{60.666} = \\frac{118}{182}.\n  \\]\n- Simplify by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{118}{182} = \\frac{59}{91}.\n  \\]\n\n### Step 5: Match with Options\nThe ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is **59:91**. Among the options provided, both **B** and **D** are identical and represent this ratio. Since both options are the same, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: D**",
