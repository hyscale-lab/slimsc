      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a train's journey, and I'm trying to figure out the total duration. Hmm. Let me read it again.\n\nThe train runs at 100 miles per hour and takes 10 hours to reach its destination. Wait, wait, so if it's going at 100 mph for 10 hours, that means the total distance is 100 * 10 = 1000 miles. Oh, right, because distance equals speed multiplied by time. So the total distance is 1000 miles.\n\nNow, the problem says that after covering a quarter of the distance, it starts raining. So the train covers the first quarter, then slows down to 75 mph for the remaining part. I need to calculate the total time taken for the entire journey.\n\nWait, let's break it down. The first part is a quarter of the distance. So quarter of 1000 miles is 250 miles. The train is going at 100 mph for this part. So the time taken for the first quarter is distance divided by speed. So that's 250 miles / 100 mph. Let me compute that. 250 divided by 100 is 2.5 hours. So that's 2.5 hours for the first part.\n\nThe remaining distance is the total minus the quarter, so 1000 - 250 = 750 miles. But now the train slows down to 75 mph. So the time for this part is 750 miles divided by 75 mph. Let me calculate that. 750 / 75 is 10 hours. Oh, so the second part takes 10 hours.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The initial statement said the train takes 10 hours to reach its destination when going at 100 mph. But in this problem, it's only going the first quarter at 100 and the rest at 75. So the total time is the sum of the first part and the second part.\n\nSo first part time is 2.5 hours, second part is 10 hours. Adding them together gives 12.5 hours. So the total journey duration is 12.5 hours.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 12.5. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but I should double-check my calculations. Let me go through each step again.\n\nTotal distance is 1000 miles. So a quarter is 250 miles. Time for first part: 250 / 100 = 2.5 hours. Correct.\n\nRemaining distance: 750 miles. Speed is 75 mph. Time is 750 / 75 = 10 hours. Correct.\n\nTotal time is 2.5 + 10 = 12.5. So yes, option C.\n",

Let me read it carefully and think it through step by step.\n\nThe train is initially running at 100 miles per hour and takes 10 hours to reach its destination. Hmm, wait a second, that part doesn't make sense. Because if it's going 100 mph for 10 hours, the total distance would be 100 *10 = 1000 miles. But then the problem says that after covering a quarter of the distance, it starts raining and slows down to 75 mph. So I think maybe the original statement is a bit misleading. Let me re-read it.\n\nWait, the question says the train is running at 100 mph and takes 10 hours. But then after covering a quarter of the distance, the speed changes. So the initial plan was 10 hours at 100 mph, but the problem is that after a quarter of the distance, the speed drops, so the total time will be longer than 10 hours.\n\nWait no, maybe the original 10 hours is under normal circumstances, but with the rain, the journey is longer. But the way the question is phrased, I think the first part is just giving the speed and the time, but the actual journey will have some part at 100 mph and the rest at 75 mph.\n\nWait, perhaps the train's original schedule was 100 mph for 10 hours, but now it's changed because it rained part of the way. So the distance is the same, but the time taken will be more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial statement is that the train was supposed to take 10 hours at 100 mph, making the distance 1000 miles. But then, during the journey, after covering a quarter of the distance (so 250 miles), it starts raining, and the speed drops to 75 mph for the remaining three quarters. So the time taken would be more than 10 hours.\n\nWait, but how? Let me structure this.\n\nDistance = speed \u00d7 time. So original plan: 100 mph \u00d710h = 1000 miles. So the total distance is 1000 miles.\n\nNow, in the new scenario, the train covers the first quarter (250 miles) at 100 mph, then the remaining three quarters (750 miles) at 75 mph.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says the train is running at 100 mph and takes 10 hours. Then, after covering a quarter of the distance, it starts raining and slows down. So the entire distance is 1000 miles, but part of the journey is at 75 mph.\n\nSo the journey is split into two parts: first quarter (250 miles) at 100 mph, then the remaining 750 miles at 75 mph.\n\nSo I can calculate the time taken for each part and sum them.\n\nFirst part: distance 250 miles, speed 100 mph. Time = distance/speed = 250/100 = 2.5 hours.\n\nSecond part: 750 miles at 75 mph. Time = 750 /75 =10 hours.\n\nSo total time is 2.5 +10 =12.5 hours.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. 250 divided by 100 is indeed 2.5. 750 divided by 75 is 10. So total is 12.5 hours. Looking at the options, option C is 12.5. So the answer should be C.\n",
