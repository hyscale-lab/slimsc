      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. \n\nThe question says that M men agree to purchase a gift for Rs. D. If 3 men drop out, how much more will each have to contribute towards the purchase of the gift? The options are given as A to E.\n\nHmm, right. So, initially, M men are buying a gift that costs D rupees. So each of them would contribute an equal share. I think I need to find out the initial amount each person pays and then find the new amount after 3 drop out. Then, the difference would be how much more each has to contribute.\n\nLet me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the initial contribution per person. If there are M men, and the total cost is D, then each person's share is D divided by M. So, initial contribution per person is D/M.\n\nThen, 3 men drop out. So now, the number of men is M-3. The total cost remains the same, D. So each of the remaining M-3 men has to contribute D/(M-3) each.\n\nNow, the question is asking how much more each has to contribute. So I think I need to subtract the initial amount from the new amount.\n\nSo the increase per person is (D/(M-3)) - (D/M).\n\nLet me compute that. Let's write it as D/(M-3) - D/M.\n\nTo subtract these two fractions, I'll find a common denominator, which would be M(M-3). So, I'll rewrite each fraction:\n\nD/(M-3) = D*M/(M(M-3))\nD/M = D*(M-3)/(M(M-3))\n\nSubtracting them: [D*M - D*(M-3)] / [M(M-3)].\n\nExpanding the numerator: D*M - D*M + 3D = 3D.\n\nSo the numerator is 3D, denominator is M(M-3).\n\nSo the increase is 3D/(M(M-3)).\n\nLooking at the options, let me check each one.\n\nOption A: D/(M-3) \u2014 that's the new contribution, not the increase. So not A.\n\nOption B: MD/3 \u2014 that seems like the initial total divided by 3, but not sure. Doesn't match what I have.\n\nOption C: M/(D-3) \u2014 that's M divided by (D minus 3), which doesn't fit. Probably not.\n\nOption D: 3D/(M\u00b2 -3M). Wait, M squared minus 3M is M(M-3), which is the denominator I have. So 3D/(M(M-3)) is the same as 3D/(M\u00b2-3M). So option D is 3D/(M\u00b2-3M), which matches.\n\nWait, wait. Let me make sure. The increase is 3D/(M(M-3)), which is equal to 3D/(M\u00b2 -3M). So option D is correct.\n\nBut wait, another thought. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption D is written as 3D/(M2-3M). Oh, I think M2 is M squared. So yes, that's the same as M(M-3). So D is the correct option.\n\nWait, but let me think about the problem again. Suppose M=5, D=15. So initial contribution is 15/5=3 each. If 3 drop out, 2 left. So each pays 15/2=7.5. So the increase is 4.5.\n\nNow, using the formula I have: 3D/(M(M-3)).\n\nPlugging M=5, D=15: 3*15/(5*2)=45/(10)=4.5. Correct.\n\nOption D gives 3*15/(5\u00b2-3*5)=45/(25-15)=45/10=4.5. So that's correct.\n\nWhat about another example. Let me take M=6, D=24.\n\nInitial per person:24/6=4.\n\nAfter 3 drop out, 3 left. Each pays 24/3=8. So increase is 4.\n\nUsing the formula: 3*24/(6*3) =72/(18)=4. Correct.\n\nOption D: 3*24/(6\u00b2-3*6)=72/(36-18)=72/18=4. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works, so option D is the answer. Therefore, the correct choice is D.\n",
