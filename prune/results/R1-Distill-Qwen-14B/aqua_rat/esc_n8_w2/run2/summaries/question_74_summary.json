      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about arranging books on a shelf. Let me think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is asking how many ways I can arrange six different books: English, Hindi, Mathematics, History, Geography, and Science. \n\nWait, I remember from my classes that arranging objects is a permutation problem. Oh right, permutations are about the order of things. So when all the items are distinct, like these books, the number of ways to arrange them is the factorial of the number of items.\n\nSo the number of books here is six. Factorial of 6 is calculated as 6! which is 6 multiplied by 5, then 4, 3, 2, 1. Let me compute that. 6 * 5 is 30, then 30 *4 is 120, 120 *3 is 360, 360 *2 is 720, and 720 *1 is still 720. So 6! equals 720.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 720. So that should be the answer. But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Are there any constraints? The question doesn't say anything about any restrictions, like certain books not being next to each other or anything like that. So it's a straightforward permutation of 6 distinct items.\n\nSo the calculation is correct. The total number of ways is 720, which is option B.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about arranging books on a shelf. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is asking how many ways I can arrange six different books: English, Hindi, Mathematics, History, Geography, and Science. \n\nWait, so each book is unique, right? Because they're different subjects. So when you arrange them, each position on the shelf can be filled by any of the remaining books. I remember something about permutations from my math class. Oh right, permutations are about the number of ways to arrange items where the order matters.\n\nSo for the first position on the shelf, I can choose any of the six books. Once I place one book there, I have five left for the next spot. Then, for the third position, four books remain. So it's like 6 multiplied by 5 multiplied by 4, and so on until 1. \n\nLet me write that out: 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1. Oh wait, that's 6 factorial, written as 6!. What's 6! equal to? Let me calculate. 6 times 5 is 30, times 4 is 120, times 3 is 360, times 2 is 720, times 1 is still 720. So 6! equals 720.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 720. So the answer should be B. But wait, are there any constraints I'm missing? The question doesn't mention any restrictions, like certain books needing to be together or not. So I think it's a straightforward permutation problem.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the number of permutations of n distinct objects is n!. So here, n is 6, so 6! is the answer. No other factors are involved here because each book is unique and every arrangement is possible. So yeah, definitely 720 ways.\n",
