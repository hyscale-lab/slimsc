      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again: \"If one third of 3/4 of a number is 21. Then, find the number?\" The options are A)84, B)66, C)28, D)19, E)11.\n\nHmm, alright. So I think I should break this down. The problem is saying that when you take one third of three fourths of some number, you get 21. I need to find what that original number is.\n\nLet me represent the number with a variable. Let's call it 'x'. So, the number is x. \n\nThe problem states that one third of 3/4 of x equals 21. Let me translate that into an equation. So, one third of something is (1/3) multiplied by that something. And that something is three fourths of x, which is (3/4)x. So putting it together, (1/3) * (3/4)x = 21.\n\nWait, let me make sure I got that right. Yes, because it's one third of (3/4 of x). So that's 1/3 multiplied by 3/4 times x.\n\nSo the equation is (1/3)*(3/4)x =21.\n\nNow I can simplify the left side. Let's compute the coefficients. (1/3) multiplied by (3/4) is... let's see, the 3 in the numerator and the 3 in the denominator cancel out, right? So 1/3 *3/4 = (1*3)/(3*4) )= 3/12, which simplifies to 1/4.\n\nWait, 3/12 is 1/4. So the equation becomes (1/4)x = 21.\n\nSo now, to find x, I need to solve for x. If (1/4)x equals 21, then x is 21 multiplied by 4. Because if (1/4)x =21, multiplying both sides by 4 gives x=21*4.\n\n21 times 4 is 84. So x equals 84.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 84. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps. Maybe I made a mistake in the fractions. Let me recalculate the coefficients. 1/3 times 3/4. The 3 in the numerator of the second fraction cancels with the 3 in the denominator of the first. So 1/3 *3/4 = (1*1)/(1*4) = 1/4. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo 1/4 of x is 21, so x is 84. Yep, that seems right.\n",

The problem involves fractions and a number, so maybe I can translate the words into equations.\n\nLet me denote the unknown number as 'x'. The problem states that one third of 3/4 of this number equals 21. So, let's parse this out. \n\nFirst, \"3/4 of a number\" would be (3/4) * x. Then, \"one third of that\" would be (1/3) multiplied by (3/4)x. So putting it all together, the equation should be:\n\n(1/3) * (3/4) * x = 21.\n\nWait, that seems right. Now I can simplify this equation to find x. Let's compute the fractions first.\n\nMultiplying 1/3 and 3/4. Hmm, 1 times 3 is 3, and 3 times 4 is 12. So that would be 3/12. Oh wait, that simplifies to 1/4 because 3 divided by 3 is 1 and 12 divided by 3 is 4. So, (1/3)*(3/4) is 1/4.\n\nSo the equation now is (1/4) * x = 21. To solve for x, I need to get rid of the fraction 1/4 that's multiplied by x. I can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 1/4, which is 4/1.\n\nSo, multiplying both sides by 4:\n\n4 * (1/4)x = 4 * 21.\n\nOn the left side, 4 and 1/4 multiply to give 1, so it's just x. On the right, 4 times 21 is 84. So, x equals 84.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, original problem: one third of three fourths of a number is 21. So, (1/3)*(3/4)x = 21. Simplify the fractions: 1/3 times 3/4 is (1*3)/(3*4) = 3/12 = 1/4. So, 1/4 x = 21. Multiply both sides by 4: x=84. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nLooking at the options, A is 84, which matches what I found. So the answer should be option A.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Maybe I misread the problem. The problem says one third of 3/4 of the number. So, is that (1/3)*(3/4)*x or (3/4)*(1/3)*x? Well, multiplication is commutative, so it doesn't matter. 1/3 times 3/4 is the same as 3/4 times 1/3. So the order doesn't change the result. So I think I did it right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can plug the options into the equation to see which one works. Let's test option A, 84.\n\nCompute 3/4 of 84: (3/4)*84 = 63. Then, one third of 63 is 21. Which matches the problem statement. So yeah, that's correct.\n\nWhat about another option just to be safe? Let's pick option C, 28. 3/4 of 28 is 21. Then one third of 21 is 7. That's not 21, so C is wrong. So A is definitely the right answer.\n",
