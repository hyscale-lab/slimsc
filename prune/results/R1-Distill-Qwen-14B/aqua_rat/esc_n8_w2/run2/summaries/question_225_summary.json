      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says: A rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides. The length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet. We need to find the area of the parking space in square feet. The options are A)46, B)81, C)126, D)252, E)None.\n\nHmm. Alright, so it's a rectangle, so opposite sides are equal. They painted three sides, leaving one unpainted. Let me visualize this. Imagine a rectangle where three sides are painted. So, maybe two sides are length, and one is the width, or two widths and one length? Wait, no, in a rectangle, there are two lengths and two widths. So, if three sides are painted, that would consist of either two lengths and one width, or two widths and one length.\n\nWait, but which one is the unpainted side? The unpainted side is 9 feet. So, the three painted sides add up to 37 feet. Let's think about the possibilities.\n\nCase 1: Suppose the three painted sides include both lengths and one width. So, the two lengths plus one width are painted. Then, the unpainted side would be the other width. Let me denote the length as L and the width as W. So, in this case, the painted sides would be 2L + W =37, and the unpainted side is W=9. So, substituting W=9 into the equation, 2L +9=37. Subtract 9 from both sides: 2L=28 \u2192 L=14. Then, the area would be L*W=14*9=126. That's one of the options, option C.\n\nCase 2: Alternatively, suppose the three painted sides include both widths and one length. So, the painted sides are 2W + L=37, and the unpainted side is L=9. Then, substituting L=9: 2W +9=37 \u2192 2W=28 \u2192 W=14. Then, area would be 9*14=126 again. So same result.\n\nWait, so in both cases, the area comes out to 126. So, that would be option C.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through the calculations again.\n\nIn case 1: unpainted side is W=9. So the painted sides are 2L + W. So 2L +9=37 \u2192 2L=28 \u2192 L=14. Area is L*W=14*9=126.\n\nIn case 2: unpainted side is L=9. So the painted sides are 2W +9=37 \u2192 2W=28 \u2192 W=14. Area is 9*14=126.\n\nYes, so both scenarios give the same area. So the correct answer must be 126, which is option C.\n\nWait a second, but let me think again. Are there any other possibilities? For example, if the unpainted side is a length, but then perhaps the painted sides include both widths and one length. Wait, that's the same as case 2. So no, the two cases are the only possibilities.\n\nSo, the area is definitely 126. So the correct option is C.\n",

If three sides are painted, that leaves one side unpainted. \n\nWait, so the rectangle has two possibilities: either the unpainted side is a length or a width. Because if three sides are painted, it's either two widths and one length, or two lengths and one width. But wait, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So if three sides are painted, the fourth is not. So for example, imagine a rectangle where the top, left, and right sides are painted, leaving the bottom unpainted. Or the bottom, left, and right painted, leaving the top. Or maybe the front, left, and back painted, leaving the right side. Wait, no, the sides are length and width. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of variables. Let me assign variables. Let's say the length is L and the width is W. So the rectangle has two lengths and two widths. Now, three sides are painted. So, which combination of sides are painted?\n\nCase 1: Two widths and one length are painted. So, the unpainted side is the other length, which would be 9 feet. So L = 9.\n\nIn this case, the painted sides would be two widths (each W) and one length (L=9). So the sum of painted sides would be 2W + L = 2W +9. According to the problem, this sum is 37 feet. So 2W +9=37. Solving for W: 2W =37-9=28 \u2192 W=14. Then the area would be L * W = 9 *14 = 126. Hmm, that's option C.\n\nCase 2: Alternatively, two lengths and one width are painted.
