      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it says.\n\nThe question is about two numbers that are in the ratio 3:5. Then, if 9 is subtracted from each, their new ratio becomes 12:23. I'm supposed to find the smaller number, and the options are A)21, B)33, C)35, D)42, E)58.\n\nHmm, ratios. I remember that when two numbers are in a ratio, we can represent them as multiples of that ratio. So, if the ratio is 3:5, I can call the numbers 3x and 5x, where x is some common multiplier.\n\nRight, so the first number is 3x, the second is 5x. Now, the problem says that if 9 is subtracted from each, the new ratio is 12:23. So, subtracting 9 from both, the new numbers are (3x -9) and (5x -9), and their ratio is 12:23.\n\nSo, setting up the equation: (3x -9)/(5x -9) = 12/23.\n\nI think the way to solve this is by cross-multiplying. So, 23*(3x -9) equals 12*(5x -9). Let me write that out.\n\n23*(3x -9) = 12*(5x -9).\n\nExpanding both sides: 23*3x is 69x, and 23*(-9) is -207. On the right side, 12*5x is 60x, and 12*(-9) is -108. So putting it together:\n\n69x - 207 = 60x - 108.\n\nNow, I'll bring like terms together. Subtract 60x from both sides: 69x -60x is 9x, so 9x -207 = -108.\n\nThen, add 207 to both sides: 9x = -108 +207. Let's compute that: 207 minus 108 is 99. So 9x =99.\n\nDivide both sides by 9: x = 11.\n\nSo, x is 11. Now, the original numbers were 3x and 5x. So the smaller number is 3x, which is 3*11=33. Wait, but looking at the options, 33 is option B. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check because sometimes I make mistakes in the calculations.\n\nWait, let me recheck the cross-multiplication step. So, 23*(3x-9) = 12*(5x-9). Let me compute 23*(3x) =69x, 23*(-9)= -207. 12*(5x)=60x, 12*(-9)= -108. So 69x -207 =60x -108.\n\nSubtract 60x from both sides: 9x -207 = -108.\n\nAdd 207 to both sides: 9x=99. So x=11. That seems correct.\n\nSo the numbers are 3*11=33 and 5*11=55. Then, subtracting 9 from each: 33-9=24, 55-9=46. The new ratio should be 24:46. Let me simplify that: both are divisible by 2, so 12:23. Oh, that's correct. So the smaller number is 33, which is option B.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again, option B is 33. But wait, the problem says \"the smaller number is?\" So 33 is the smaller one because the other is 55. So the correct answer is B)33.\n\nWait a second, but I just noticed that option E is 58. Hmm, but in our calculation, x was 11, so 3x=33 and 5x=55. So yeah, 33 is the smaller number. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the equation setup. Because sometimes when you subtract, the ratio could be flipped. Did I get the ratio correctly?\n\nThe problem states that when 9 is subtracted from each, the new ratio is 12:23. So (3x-9)/(5x-9) =12/23. Oh wait, that's correct because 3x is smaller than 5x, so subtracting 9 would make (3x-9) and (5x-9), which should maintain the same order. So the setup is correct.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So the answer is 33, which is option B.\n",

So putting it together:\n\n69x - 207 = 60x - 108.\n\nNow, I'll bring like terms together. Subtract 60x from both sides: 69x -60x is 9x, so 9x -207 = -108.\n\nThen, add 207 to both sides: 9x = -108 +207. Let's compute that: 207 minus 108 is 99. So 9x =99.\n\nDivide both sides by 9: x = 11.\n\nSo, x is 11. Now, the original numbers were 3x and 5x. So the smaller number is 3x, which is 3*11=33.

So 69x -207 =60x -108.\n\nSubtract 60x from both sides: 9x -207 = -108.\n\nAdd 207 to both sides: 9x=99. So x=11. That seems correct.\n\nSo the numbers are 3*11=33 and 5*11=55.

The question is asking for the smaller number, and there are five options to choose from.\n\nHmm, ratios can sometimes trip me up, but I think I can handle this. Let's break it down. First, the original ratio is 3:5. So, I can represent the two numbers as 3x and 5x, where x is a common multiplier. That makes sense because 3x divided by 5x is 3/5, which maintains the ratio.\n\nNow, the problem says that if we subtract 9 from each number, the new ratio becomes 12:23. So, the new numbers are (3x - 9) and (5x - 9). And their ratio is 12:23. So, I can set up a proportion here.\n\nThe proportion would be (3x - 9)/(5x - 9) = 12/23. Right? Because the first number minus 9 over the second number minus 9 equals 12 over 23.\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. Let's write that equation out:\n\n(3x - 9)/(5x - 9) = 12/23.\n\nTo solve for x, I'll cross-multiply. So, 23*(3x -9) = 12*(5x -9). Let me calculate that.\n\nCalculating the left side: 23 * 3x is 69x, and 23 * (-9) is -207. So left side is 69x -207.\n\nRight side: 12 *5x is 60x, and 12*(-9) is -108. So right side is 60x -108.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n69x -207 = 60x -108.\n\nNow, let's get all x terms on one side and constants on the other. Subtract 60x from both sides:\n\n69x -60x -207 = -108.\n\nWhich simplifies to 9x -207 = -108.\n\nNow, add 207 to both sides:\n\n9x = 207 -108? Wait, no. Wait, adding 207 to both sides, the equation becomes 9x = -108 +207.\n\nBecause the right side was -108, so adding 207 is like -108 +207.\n\nWhat's -108 +207? Let me calculate: 207-108 is 99, so 99.\n\nSo 9x = 99.\n\nDivide both sides by 9: x = 11.\n\nOkay, so x is 11. Now, the original numbers are 3x and 5x. So, the smaller number is 3x, which is 3*11=33. Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me double-check the cross-multiplication step.\n\n(3x -9)/(5x -9) = 12/23.\n\nCross-multiplying: 23*(3x -9) =12*(5x -9).\n\nWhich is 69x -207 =60x -108.\n\nSubtracting 60x: 9x -207 = -108.\n\nAdding 207: 9x =99, so x=11. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 3x is 33, and 5x is 55. So the smaller number is 33. Looking at the options, B is 33. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's plug these numbers back into the problem to verify.\n\nOriginal numbers: 33 and 55. Subtract 9 from each: 33-9=24, 55-9=46.\n\nNow, 24:46. Let's see if that reduces to 12:23.\n\nDivide both by 2: 12 and 23. Yes, that's correct. So the ratios match.\n\nSo the calculations are correct.
