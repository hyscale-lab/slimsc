      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I've got this problem here about a money pouch with Rs. 700. The coins are 25 paise, 50 paise, and one rupee coins, and there are equal numbers of each. Hmm, I need to find out how many of each coin there are.\n\nWait, so the number of 25 paise, 50 paise, and 1 rupee coins are all the same. Let me denote the number of each as 'n'. So, n coins of each type.\n\nBut wait, 25 paise is a quarter of a rupee, right? So each 25 paise coin is 0.25 Rs, each 50 paise is 0.50 Rs, and each 1 rupee is 1 Rs.\n\nSo the total amount from each type would be:\n\n25 paise: n * 0.25\n50 paise: n * 0.50\n1 rupee: n * 1.00\n\nAdding all these together should give 700 Rs. So the equation would be:\n\n0.25n + 0.50n + 1.00n = 700\n\nLet me add those up. 0.25 + 0.50 is 0.75, plus 1.00 makes 1.75. So 1.75n = 700.\n\nTo find n, I divide both sides by 1.75. So n = 700 / 1.75. Hmm, let me calculate that.\n\nWait, 1.75 times what is 700? Let's think in terms of fractions. 1.75 is the same as 7/4. So 7/4 * n =700. So n = 700 * (4/7). 700 divided by 7 is 100, so 100 *4 is 400. So n=400.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. 400 coins of 25 paise would be 400 * 0.25 = 100 Rs. 400 of 50 paise is 400 *0.5=200 Rs. 400 of 1 Rs is 400 Rs. Adding those together: 100 + 200 +400 =700. Yes, that adds up.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 400. So the answer should be C.\n",

Hmm, I need to find out how many of each coin there are. Let's see.\n\nWait, the question says equal number of each type. So if I let the number of each coin be x, then I can express the total amount in terms of x.\n\nLet me think about the denominations. 25 paise is a quarter of a rupee, so that's 0.25 Rs. 50 paise is half a rupee, which is 0.50 Rs. And one rupee is obviously 1 Rs. So each coin contributes differently to the total.\n\nSo, the total amount would be the sum of each type multiplied by their count. So for 25 paise coins, it's x multiplied by 0.25. Similarly, 50 paise would be x multiplied by 0.50, and the one rupee coins are x times 1.\n\nAdding them all together gives the equation: 0.25x + 0.50x + 1x = 700.\n\nWait, let's add those up. 0.25 + 0.50 is 0.75, plus 1 is 1.75. So 1.75x equals 700.\n\nTo find x, I can divide 700 by 1.75. Let me calculate that. 700 divided by 1.75. Hmm, 1.75 times 400 is 700, because 1.75 * 400 = 700. So x is 400.\n\nSo each type of coin is 400. So the number of each coin is 400. Looking at the options, option C is 400. But wait, the options are labeled as A, B, C, etc., but the question says \"how many of each are there?\" So the total number per coin type is 400. So the answer should be 400.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option C is 400. So the answer is C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. 400 coins of each. So 25 paise: 400 * 0.25 = 100 Rs. 50 paise: 400 * 0.5 = 200 Rs. One rupee: 400 * 1 = 400 Rs. Adding those together: 100 + 200 + 400 = 700. Yes, that adds up correctly.\n",
