      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a pen company. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's read it carefully.\n\nThe company produces pens, and on average 10% are defective and rejected. They have to deliver 7200 pens to a wholesaler, each sold at Rs. 10. Their profit is estimated to be 25% on all the manufactured pens. I need to find the manufactured cost of each pen.\n\nWait, so the company is manufacturing a certain number of pens, but 10% are defective. That means only 90% are good and can be sold. Because they need to deliver 7200, those 7200 are the good pens. So the total produced must be more than 7200.\n\nLet me think. Let's say the total number of pens produced is N. Out of these, 10% are defective, so 0.1 * N are defective. The good pens are 0.9 * N, and that's equal to 7200. So 0.9N = 7200. To find N, I can rearrange that: N = 7200 / 0.9.\n\nCalculating that: 7200 divided by 0.9 is 8000. So the company produces 8000 pens in total.\n\nNow, the company sells each pen for Rs.10, and they deliver 7200. So the total revenue would be 7200 * 10. Let me compute that: 7200 *10 is 72,000 Rs.\n\nThe profit is 25% on all the manufactured pens. Wait, I need to figure out what the cost is. So the profit is 25% of the cost. Let's denote the manufacturing cost per pen as C. So total manufacturing cost is N * C, which is 8000 * C.\n\nProfit is revenue minus cost. So profit = 72,000 - (8000 * C). And this profit is 25% of the cost. So 72,000 - (8000C) = 0.25 * (8000 C).\n\nWait, let me write that equation properly. Profit equals 25% of the cost, which is 0.25 * (8000 C). So:\n\n72000 - (8000 * C) = 0.25 * (8000 C)\n\nLet me simplify this equation. Let's compute 0.25 * 8000 C first. 0.25 *8000 is 2000, so that's 2000 C.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n72000 - 8000C = 2000C\n\nAdding 8000C to both sides:\n\n72000 = 10000C\n\nSo C is 72000 / 10000, which is 7.2. So the cost per pen is Rs.7.2. Let me check the options.\n\nOption B is 7.2. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, let me think again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So the total cost is 8000 * 7.2. Let me compute that: 8000 *7 is 56000, and 8000 *0.2 is 1600. So total is 56000 + 1600 = 57600 Rs.\n\nThe revenue is 72000, so profit is 72000 -57600 = 14400. Now, 25% of the cost is 0.25 *57600 =14400. Yes, that matches. So the calculation is correct.\n",
