The question is asking how many different ways he can reach the top. The options are A)88, B)89, C)90, D)91, E)92.\n\nHmm, I remember something about this being a combinatorial problem. Maybe it's related to permutations or combinations, but I'm not exactly sure. Wait, I think it's a classic dynamic programming problem. Oh right, it's the same as the Fibonacci sequence!\n\nLet me think. For each step, the boy can come from the previous step (taking one step) or from two steps back (taking two steps). So the total number of ways to reach step n is the sum of the ways to reach step n-1 and step n-2.\n\nSo for n=1, there's only one way: take a single step. For n=2, he can take two single steps or one double step, so that's two ways. Let's see if that holds.\n\nLet me list out the number of ways for the first few steps to find a pattern.\n\nn=1: 1 way\nn=2: 2 ways\nn=3: Let's see, he can take 1+1+1, 1+2, or 2+1. That's 3 ways.\nn=4: Let's compute. The number of ways to get to 4 is the sum of ways to get to 3 and 2. So 3 + 2 =5.\nn=5: 5+3=8\nn=6: 8+5=13\nn=7: 13+8=21\nn=8: 21+13=34\nn=9: 34+21=55\nn=10: 55+34=89\n\nWait, so the 10th step has 89 ways. Looking at the options, option B is 89. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the pattern.\n\nn=1:1\nn=2:2\nn=3:3 (1+2)\nn=4:5 (3+2)\nn=5:8 (5+3)\nn=6:13 (8+5)\nn=7:21 (13+8)\nn=8:34 (21+13)\nn=9:55 (34+21)\nn=10:89 (55+34)\nYep, that seems correct.
