      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about bonds and interest. Hmm, let me think. Jerry bought a 1-year bond for $5,000, and it has a 12% annual interest rate, compounded every six months. I need to find out how much interest it has accrued by the time it matures. \n\nWait, compound interest, right? So I remember the formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt). Where:\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- P is the principal amount, which is $5,000 here.\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal), so 12% would be 0.12.\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year. Since it's compounded every six months, that's twice a year, so n=2.\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years. Here, it's 1 year.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers: P is 5000, r is 0.12, n is 2, t is 1. Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, let me compute (1 + r/n). r/n is 0.12 divided by 2, which is 0.06. So 1 + 0.06 is 1.06.\n\nNext, nt is 2*1 = 2. So the exponent is 2.\n\nSo A = 5000 * (1.06)^2. Hmm, what's 1.06 squared? Let me calculate that. 1.06 * 1.06 = 1.1236. Oh wait, no, wait. 1.06 times 1.06. Let's do it step by step: 1 times 1 is 1, 1 times 0.06 is 0.06, 0.06 times 1 is 0.06, and 0.06 times 0.06 is 0.0036. Adding them up: 1 + 0.06 + 0.06 + 0.0036 = 1.1236. So yes, 1.06 squared is 1.1236.\n\nSo A = 5000 * 1.1236. Let me compute that. 5000 multiplied by 1.1236. Hmm. 5000 * 1 = 5000, 5000 * 0.1236 = ?\n\nWait, 0.1236 is 12.36%. So 5000 * 0.1236. Let me calculate that. 5000 * 0.1 is 500, 5000 * 0.02 is 100, 5000 * 0.0036 is 18. So adding those together: 500 + 100 = 600, plus 18 is 618. So 5000 * 0.1236 = 618. Therefore, the total amount A is 5000 + 618 = $5618.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the interest accrued, not the total amount. So the interest would be A minus the principal, right? So 5618 - 5000 = 618. So the interest is $618.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is $618. So the correct answer should be B.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations. Because sometimes when I do this in my head, I might make a mistake.\n\nSo, the formula again: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt). Plugging in the numbers:\n\nP=5000, r=0.12, n=2, t=1.\n\nSo 5000*(1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1) = 5000*(1.06)^2.\n\nYes, 1.06 squared is 1.1236. 5000 * 1.1236 is 5618. So the interest is 618. So that's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be B) $618.\n",
