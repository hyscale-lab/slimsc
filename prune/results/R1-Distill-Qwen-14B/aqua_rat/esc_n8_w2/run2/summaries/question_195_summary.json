      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about three bells ringing at different intervals, and I need to find out when they'll ring together again. Hmm, I think this is a least common multiple problem. Let me think through it step by step.\n\nThe intervals are 36 seconds, 40 seconds, and 48 seconds. So I need to find the LCM of these three numbers. Wait, LCM stands for Least Common Multiple, right? That's the smallest number that all three intervals can divide into, which means all the bells will ring together again after that time.\n\nFirst, I should probably break each number down into its prime factors. Let me start with 36. \n\n36 divided by 2 is 18, again by 2 is 9. Then 9 is 3 squared. So 36 = 2^2 * 3^2.\n\nNext is 40. 40 divided by 2 is 20, again by 2 is 10, then by 2 is 5. So 40 is 2^3 * 5^1.\n\nThen 48. 48 divided by 2 is 24, again by 2 is 12, again by 2 is 6, and again by 2 is 3. So 48 is 2^4 * 3^1.\n\nNow, to find the LCM, I take the highest power of each prime number present. So for 2, the highest power is 2^4 from 48. For 3, the highest is 3^2 from 36. And for 5, it's 5^1 from 40.\n\nSo LCM = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5^1. Let's calculate that.\n\n2^4 is 16. 3^2 is 9. 16 * 9 = 144. Then 144 *5 is 720. So the LCM is 720 seconds.\n\nWait, how many minutes is that? Since 60 seconds are in a minute, 720 divided by 60 is 12 minutes. Oh, so 12 minutes is the time when they'll all ring together again.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 12 minutes. So the correct answer should be B.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Did I calculate the LCM correctly? Let's see:\n\n36: factors into 2^2 *3^2.\n\n40: 2^3 *5.\n\n48: 2^4 *3.\n\nSo LCM would be 2^4 (since that's the highest power of 2), 3^2 (highest of 3), and 5 (highest of 5). So yes, 16 *9 is 144, 144 *5 is 720 seconds. 720 divided by 60 is 12. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer is option B, after 12 minutes.\n",
