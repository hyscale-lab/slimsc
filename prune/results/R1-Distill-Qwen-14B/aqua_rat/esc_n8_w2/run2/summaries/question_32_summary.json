      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a map scale, and I need to figure out the actual distance between Town F and Town G. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.\n\nThe question says that on the map, the road from Town F to G is 20 inches long. Oh wait, and the map scale is such that 1/4 inch represents 10 miles. Right, so I need to find out how many miles 20 inches on the map actually is in real life.\n\nWait, how do these scale conversions usually work? I remember that scale is a ratio between the distance on the map and the actual distance. So, if 1/4 inch equals 10 miles, then each inch on the map is equal to a certain number of miles.\n\nLet me think. 1/4 inch is 10 miles. So, how many miles is one inch? Well, if 0.25 inches (since 1/4 is 0.25) equals 10 miles, then one inch would be 10 divided by 0.25. Let me calculate that. 10 / 0.25 is the same as 10 multiplied by 4, which is 40. So, one inch on the map equals 40 miles in real life.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Wait, wait, no. Because if 1/4 inch is 10 miles, then each inch is four times that, right? Because 1 inch is four times 1/4 inch. So yeah, 10 miles times four would be 40 miles per inch. So, the scale is 1 inch equals 40 miles.\n\nBut wait, the distance on the map is 20 inches. So, the actual distance would be 20 inches multiplied by 40 miles per inch. Let me do that multiplication: 20 * 40 is 800. So, that would be 800 miles.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 800. So that's the answer, right?\n\nWait, did I make any mistakes here? Let me double-check. So, 1/4 inch is 10 miles. So for 1 inch, it's 10 * 4 = 40. Then 20 inches * 40 miles/inch = 800. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the scale is 1/4 inch : 10 miles. So, to find out how many miles 20 inches represent, I can set up a proportion.\n\nLet me write it as (1/4 inch)/(10 miles) = (20 inches)/(x miles). Cross-multiplying, (1/4)x = 20 * 10. So, (1/4)x = 200. Multiply both sides by 4: x = 800. Yep, same result.\n\nSo I'm confident the answer is A)800.\n",

Hmm, the question says that on a map, the road from Town F to Town G is 20 inches long. And the scale given is that 1/4 inch represents 10 miles. I need to find the actual distance between the towns in miles.\n\nWait, so the map uses a scale where a certain measurement on the map corresponds to a real-world distance. I remember that for map scales, it's usually a ratio, like how much real distance one unit on the map stands for.\n\nSo, the scale is 1/4 inch equals 10 miles. That means every quarter inch on the map is ten miles in real life. But the road is 20 inches on the map. I need to find out how many tenths of a mile that is.\n\nLet me think, how do I convert the map distance to actual distance. Oh, right, it's a proportion problem. So if 1/4 inch is 10 miles, then 1 inch would be 4 times that, because 1 divided by (1/4) is 4. So 1 inch equals 40 miles. Wait, no, wait. Let me recalculate. Because 1/4 inch is 10 miles. So to find how many miles per inch, I multiply both sides by 4. So 1 inch is 40 miles. Oh, right, because 10 miles multiplied by 4 equals 40.\n\nSo now, the map shows 20 inches. So the actual distance would be 20 inches multiplied by 40 miles per inch. Let me do that calculation. 20 times 40 is 800. Oh, so the actual distance is 800 miles. Hmm, looking at the options, option A is 800. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I get the conversion right? Because sometimes I mix up the ratios. Let me double-check. So, 1/4 inch equals 10 miles. So for each inch, how many miles? Well, if I have 10 miles for 0.25 inches, then per inch it's 10 / 0.25 = 40 miles. Yeah, that's correct.
