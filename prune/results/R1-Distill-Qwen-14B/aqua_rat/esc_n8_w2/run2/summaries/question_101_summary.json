      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about the ratio of red to green sweets. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the ratio is 3:4, right? That means for every 3 red sweets, there are 4 green ones. \n\nWait, the bag has 120 green sweets. Oh, right, so the number of green sweets is 4 parts of the ratio. So each part must be equal to 120 divided by 4. Let me calculate that. 120 divided by 4 is 30. Oh, so each part is 30 sweets.\n\nNow, since the red sweets are 3 parts, I multiply 3 by 30. 3 times 30 is 90. So there should be 90 red sweets. Looking at the options, option A is 90. That must be the answer. \n\nWait, did I do that right? Let me double-check. If the ratio is 3:4, then red is 3x and green is 4x. Green is 120, so 4x=120. Solving for x, x=30. So red is 3*30=90. Yeah, that makes sense. So the answer should be A)90.\n",

And they told me there are 120 green sweets. I need to find out how many red sweets there are.\n\nWait, ratios can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that ratios compare quantities. So, for every 3 red sweets, there are 4 green ones. So the ratio 3:4 means that for each part of red, there are 4 parts of green.\n\nBut how do I apply this to the actual numbers? Oh, right, ratios can be scaled up or down. So if I consider the ratio as parts, then the number of green sweets would be 4 parts, and red would be 3 parts.\n\nThe problem says there are 120 green sweets. So 4 parts equal 120. How do I find out what one part is worth? I think I can divide 120 by 4. Let me do that: 120 divided by 4 is 30. Oh, so each part is 30 sweets.\n\nNow, since the red sweets are 3 parts, I multiply 3 by 30. Let's see, 3 times 30 is 90. So that should be the number of red sweets.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If red is 90 and green is 120, the ratio would be 90:120. Simplifying that, both numbers can be divided by 30. 90 divided by 30 is 3, and 120 divided by 30 is 4. So yes, the ratio becomes 3:4 again.
