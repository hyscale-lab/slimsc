      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a man dividing Rs 8600 among his relatives. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty with such problems, but I'll take it slow.\n\nThe problem says he divides the money among 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews. Each daughter gets four times as much as each nephew, and each son gets five times as much as each nephew. I need to find out how much each daughter receives.\n\nHmm, so let's break this down. I think I should assign variables to each of the amounts. Let me let the amount each nephew gets be something, say x. Then, each daughter gets four times that, so 4x. Each son gets five times, so 5x.\n\nWait, okay. So the total amount is the sum of all the money given to sons, daughters, and nephews. Let me write that as an equation.\n\nThe total money is 8600. So the sum would be:\n\n(Number of sons * amount per son) + (Number of daughters * amount per daughter) + (Number of nephews * amount per nephew) = 8600.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n5 sons * 5x each = 25x\n4 daughters *4x each =16x\n2 nephews *x each=2x\n\nSo adding all these together: 25x +16x +2x = 8600.\n\nLet me add those coefficients: 25+16 is 41, plus 2 is 43. So 43x = 8600.\n\nTo find x, I can divide both sides by 43. Let me do that: x=8600/43. Hmm, what's 8600 divided by 43? Let me calculate.\n\n43 times 200 is 8600, right? Because 43*200=8600. So x=200. So each nephew gets Rs 200.\n\nBut the question is about each daughter. Each daughter gets 4x, so 4*200 is 800. Oh wait, but wait, wait. Let me double-check. Because 4x would be 4*200=800. So each daughter gets Rs 800.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is Rs 800. So is that the answer? Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nWait, another way to think: 5 sons each get 5x=5*200=1000 each. So 5 sons would be 5*1000=5000. 4 daughters each get 800, so 4*800=3200. 2 nephews each get 200, so 2*200=400. Now adding all: 5000 +3200 is 8200, plus 400 is 8600. Yes, that adds up correctly. So each daughter gets 800. So the answer should be E) Rs 800.\n\nWait, but wait. I'm a bit confused because sometimes in such problems, the way the ratios are set up can be tricky. Let me make sure I got the ratios right. Each daughter is four times a nephew. Each son is five times a nephew. So if nephew is x, daughter is 4x, son is 5x. That seems correct.\n\nAnother way: Let me try plugging the options. Suppose the answer is E) 800. Then each daughter is 800, so each nephew is 800/4=200. Each son is 5*200=1000.\n\nSo sons: 5*1000=5000. Daughters:4*800=3200. Nephews:2*200=400. Total is 5000+3200=8200+400=8600. Perfect, that matches.\n\nSo yeah, I'm confident now. The answer is E) Rs 800.\n",

Let me read it again carefully.\n\nA man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews. Each daughter gets four times as much as each nephew, and each son gets five times as much as each nephew. The question is, how much does each daughter receive?\n\nHmm. So, I need to find out the amount each daughter gets. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I think I should assign variables to the amounts each category receives. Let's say each nephew gets 'x' rupees. Then, since each daughter gets four times that, each daughter would get 4x. And each son gets five times as much as a nephew, so each son gets 5x.\n\nNow, let's figure out how much each group gets in total. There are 5 sons, so the total for sons is 5 * 5x = 25x. There are 4 daughters, so their total is 4 * 4x = 16x. And the 2 nephews would get 2 * x = 2x.\n\nAdding all these together should equal the total amount, which is 8600. So:\n\n25x (sons) + 16x (daughters) + 2x (nephews) = 8600.\n\nLet me add those coefficients up: 25 + 16 is 41, plus 2 is 43. So 43x = 8600.\n\nTo find x, I can divide both sides by 43. So x = 8600 / 43. Let me do that calculation. 43 times 200 is 8600, right? Because 43*200 is 8600. So x is 200.\n\nWait, that's each nephew getting 200. But the question is about each daughter. Each daughter gets 4x, so 4 * 200 is 800. So each daughter gets Rs 800.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is Rs 800. So that should be the answer.\n",
