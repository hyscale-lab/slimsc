      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a picket fence, and I need to figure out the total length of the fence in feet. Hmm, let me read it again.\n\nThe question says that there are x pickets, each 1/2 inch wide. And between each pair of pickets, there are 6 inches of space. I need to find which option represents the total length of the fence in feet.\n\nWait, let me think about how fences are structured. Each picket is a vertical post, and the space between them is the horizontal gap. So for x pickets, how many spaces are there between them? Oh right, if there are x pickets, the number of gaps between them is (x - 1). Because imagine two pickets, one gap; three pickets, two gaps, etc.\n\nSo each picket is 1/2 inch wide, so the total width of all pickets would be x multiplied by 1/2 inch. So that's (x * 1/2) inches. \n\nAnd each gap is 6 inches. Since there are (x -1) gaps, the total space is 6*(x-1) inches.\n\nSo the total length of the fence is the sum of the picket widths and the gaps. So total inches would be (x/2) + 6*(x-1).\n\nLet me compute that: x/2 + 6x -6. Let's combine like terms. x/2 is 0.5x, and 6x is 6x. So 0.5x +6x is 6.5x, which is 13x/2. Then subtract 6. So the total inches is (13x/2) -6.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the length in feet. Oh, right, because 1 foot is 12 inches. So I need to convert inches to feet. So I should divide the total inches by 12.\n\nSo, the total feet would be [(13x/2) -6] / 12. Let me compute that. Let me write it as (13x/2 -6) /12. \n\nTo simplify, I can write this as (13x -12)/24. Because let's see: (13x/2) is the same as (13x * 12) over (2*12), but wait, maybe I should break it down.\n\nWait, let me compute each part separately. Let's take the numerator: (13x/2) -6. To combine these, I can write 6 as 12/2. So it's (13x -12)/2. Then, when I divide this by 12, it becomes (13x -12)/(2*12) = (13x -12)/24.\n\nSo the total length is (13x -12)/24 feet. Looking at the options, option E is (13x-12)/24. So that must be the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The initial setup: x pickets, each 0.5 inches. So x * 0.5 is 0.5x. The gaps are 6 inches each, but there are x-1 gaps. So 6*(x-1) =6x-6. So total inches is 0.5x +6x -6 =6.5x -6, which is 13x/2 -6 inches. Converting to feet: (13x/2 -6)/12. Let's compute that:\n\n(13x/2 -6) /12 = (13x -12) / (24). So yes, that's correct.\n\nLooking back at the options, option E is (13x-12)/24. So the answer should be E.\n",

I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of word problems, but I'll take it slow.\n\nThe problem says it's a straight picket fence with x pickets. Each picket is 1/2 inch wide. And there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets. I need to find the total length of the fence in feet. The options are given, and I have to pick the correct one.\n\nHmm, so first, let me visualize the fence. It's a straight fence made up of multiple pickets and spaces between them. Each picket is 1/2 inch wide. The spaces are 6 inches each. So if there are x pickets, how many spaces are there?\n\nWait, if there are x pickets, the number of spaces between them would be one less than x, right? Like, if you have two pickets, there's one space between them. So for x pickets, it's x-1 spaces. Oh, that makes sense.\n\nSo the total length contributed by the pickets themselves is x times the width of each picket. Each picket is 1/2 inch, so that's x*(1/2) inches. Let me write that down: picket_length = x * (1/2) inches.\n\nThen the spaces. Each space is 6 inches, and there are (x-1) spaces. So the total space length is (x-1)*6 inches. So space_length = 6*(x-1).\n\nAdding both together, the total length in inches is picket_length + space_length. So that's (x/2) + 6*(x-1).\n\nWait, let me compute that. Expanding the terms: x/2 + 6x -6. Let me combine like terms. So x/2 is 0.5x, and 6x is 6x. 0.5x +6x is 6.5x. Then subtract 6: 6.5x -6.\n\nWait, 6.5 is the same as 13/2. So 6.5x is (13x)/2. So the total length in inches is (13x/2) -6 inches.\n\nBut the problem asks for the length in feet. Oh right, because 1 foot is 12 inches. So I need to convert inches to feet by dividing by 12.\n\nSo the total length in feet is ((13x/2) -6) / 12. Let me compute that. Dividing each term by 12.\n\n(13x/2) divided by 12 is (13x)/(2*12) = 13x/24. And 6 divided by 12 is 0.5 or 1/2. So the expression becomes (13x/24) - (6/12) \u2192 13x/24 - 0.5.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, I don't see that exact expression. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are:\nA)13x/2\nB)13x/2 - 6\nC)13x/24\nD)(13x+1)/24\nE)(13x-12)/24\n\nHmm, none of the options directly match 13x/24 - 0.5. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should express the entire expression as a single fraction. Let me try that again.\n\nTotal length in inches: (13x/2) -6. Converting to feet: [(13x/2) -6 ] /12.\n\nLet me write that as a single fraction. Multiply numerator and denominator: [13x -12 ] / 24. Because 13x/2 is (13x *12)/(2*12) = 13x*6/12? Wait, no, perhaps a better approach is to get a common denominator.\n\nWait, [(13x/2) -6 ] /12 = (13x -12)/24. Because 13x/2 is equal to (13x *12)/(2*12) = 13x *6/12 \u2192 No, that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me compute the numerator as (13x/2 -6). Then divide by 12.\n\nSo (13x/2 -6) = (13x -12)/2. Because 6 is 12/2, so 13x/2 -12/2 = (13x -12)/2.\n\nThen divide by 12: [(13x -12)/2 ] /12 = (13x -12) / (2*12) )= (13x-12)/24.\n\nAh, that's better. So the total length is (13x-12)/24 feet.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is (13x-12)/24. So that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check. So each picket is 0.5 inches, so x pickets are 0.5x inches. The spaces between them are 6*(x-1) inches. So total inches is 0.5x +6(x-1) = 0.5x +6x -6 = 6.5x -6 inches. 6.5 is 13/2, so 13x/2 -6 inches. Convert to feet: (13x/2 -6) /12.\n\nWhich is the same as (13x -12)/24.
