      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm. So, the question is about a shopkeeper who employs a servant. The servant has a fixed monthly salary and also gets a commission based on sales. The goal is to find out how much the servant needs to sell each month to have a total income of 6000 rupees.\n\nLet me read the problem again. The servant's monthly salary is 1500 rupees. Plus, there's a commission of 15% on the monthly sales. The servant wants his monthly income to be 6000. So, I need to find the sale amount that would make his total income 6000.\n\nWait, so his total income is salary plus commission. So, the equation would be: 1500 + (15% of sales) = 6000.\n\nRight, so let me denote the sales amount as 'S'. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n1500 + 0.15 * S = 6000.\n\nI need to solve for S. So, subtract 1500 from both sides first. \n\n0.15 * S = 6000 - 1500. \n\n6000 minus 1500 is 4500. So,\n\n0.15 * S = 4500.\n\nTo find S, I'll divide both sides by 0.15.\n\nS = 4500 / 0.15.\n\nHmm, what's 4500 divided by 0.15? Let me calculate that. \n\nWait, 0.15 is the same as 15/100. So dividing by 0.15 is the same as multiplying by 100/15.\n\nSo, 4500 * (100/15) = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 4500 divided by 15 is 300. Because 15*300 is 4500. Then, 300 multiplied by 100 is 30,000.\n\nSo, S is 30,000 rupees. \n\nLooking at the options, option A is 30000. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\n1500 plus 15% of 30000. 15% of 30000 is 4500. 1500 + 4500 equals 6000, which matches the required income. Yep, that makes sense. So option A is correct.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the required monthly sales for the servant to achieve a total income of 6000 rupees, we start by noting the fixed salary and the commission structure. The servant earns a fixed salary of 1500 rupees and a 15% commission on monthly sales. Let the monthly sales be denoted as \\( S \\). The total income can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Income} = \\text{Salary} + \\text{Commission} = 1500 + 0.15 \\times S\n\\]\n\nThe servant aims for a total income of 6000 rupees. Setting up the equation:\n\n\\[\n1500 + 0.15 \\times S = 6000\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 1500 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n0.15 \\times S = 4500\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( S \\) by dividing both sides by 0.15:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{4500}{0.15} = 30000\n\\]\n\nThus, the servant needs to achieve a monthly sale of 30,000 rupees to meet his income goal. Verifying this, 15% of 30,000 is 4500, and adding the fixed salary of 1500 gives:\n\n\\[\n1500 + 4500 = 6000\n\\]\n\nThis confirms the calculation is correct. The correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: A**",

The question is, how much sale in rupees should the servant do to achieve that income?\n\nHmm, so the servant has a fixed salary and a variable commission based on sales. His total desired income is 6000. So I need to find out what the total sales need to be so that when the commission is added to the salary, it equals 6000.\n\nLet me think about the components here.
