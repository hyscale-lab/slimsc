      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about two balls rotating on a circular track. Hmm, let me read it again. Oh right, ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes, and ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes. They start at the same point, and I need to find when they'll both be back at the starting point again. The options are from A to E, with various hours and minutes.\n\nWait, so the key here is to find the time when both balls complete an integer number of rotations, bringing them back to their starting positions simultaneously. That makes me think of the least common multiple, or LCM, of their rotation periods. Oh right, because LCM gives the smallest time where both events coincide.\n\nSo first, I need to find out how long each ball takes to make one full rotation. Ball A does 2 rotations in 26 minutes. So the time per rotation for A is 26 divided by 2, which is 13 minutes per rotation. Got that.\n\nBall B does 5 rotations in 35 minutes. So B's time per rotation is 35 divided by 5. Let me calculate that: 35/5 is 7. So each rotation takes 7 minutes for B.\n\nNow, I need the LCM of 13 and 7. Wait, both 13 and 7 are prime numbers, right? So their LCM is just 13 multiplied by 7. Let me compute that: 13 *7 is 91. So the LCM is 91 minutes.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Is 91 minutes the correct approach here? Because I'm thinking about the time each ball takes to return to the start. For ball A, every 13 minutes, it comes back. For B, every 7 minutes. So the first time they both meet again is when the time is a multiple of both 13 and 7. Hence, LCM makes sense here.\n\nSo 91 minutes is the answer. But wait, the options are in hours and minutes. So how much is 91 minutes in hours and minutes? Well, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So 91 minus 60 is 31. So that's 1 hour and 31 minutes. Looking at the options, option A is 1h31m. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the rotations. Oh no, wait. Because sometimes, especially with circular motion, the period is the time for one full circle. So yes, that's exactly what I calculated. A takes 13 min per rotation, B 7 min. LCM of 13 and 7 is 91. So yes, 91 minutes is 1h31m. So option A is correct.\n",

So I need to find the time when both have completed an integer number of rotations, bringing them back to the start.\n\nLet me break it down. Maybe I should find the time each ball takes to complete one rotation. That sounds like finding their periods.\n\nFor Ball A: It makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes. So the time per rotation is 26 minutes divided by 2, which is 13 minutes per rotation. So every 13 minutes, Ball A comes back to the starting point.\n\nFor Ball B: It makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes.

So after 7 rotations, it's back.\n\nBall B:91 /7=13 rotations.
