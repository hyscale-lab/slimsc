      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here: 900 plus 5 times 12. Hmm, I remember learning about the order of operations in school. Oh right, it's PEMDAS\u2014Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and then Addition and Subtraction. So I shouldn't just go from left to right; I need to handle the multiplication before adding.\n\nWait, the problem is 900 + 5 \u00d7 12. So the first step is to calculate 5 multiplied by 12. Let me think, 5 times 10 is 50, and 5 times 2 is 10. So 50 plus 10 is 60. Okay, so 5 \u00d7 12 equals 60.\n\nNow I add that result to 900. So 900 plus 60. Let's see, 900 plus 60 is 960. Hmm, so the total should be 960.\n\nLooking at the options: A is 820, which is way lower. B is 202, that's way too low. C is 420, nope. D is 209, also no. E is 960. So the correct answer must be E.\n\nWait a second, did I do that right? Did I do the multiplication first correctly? 5 times 12 is definitely 60. And 900 plus 60 is 960. Yep, that's correct. So E is the right choice.\n",
