      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where Karan bought a sewing machine for Rs. 1200, and he wants to mark it up so that even after giving a 20% discount, he still makes a 20% profit. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about where to start, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I think I need to figure out what the selling price should be after the discount to give him a 20% profit. Wait, profit is based on the cost price, right? So his cost is Rs. 1200. A 20% profit on that would be 20% of 1200. Let me calculate that: 20% of 1200 is 0.2 * 1200 = 240. So the selling price after discount should be 1200 + 240 = Rs. 1440. \n\nBut wait, that's the price after giving a 20% discount. So the marked price is higher than 1440, because when you take 20% off the marked price, it should equal 1440. Oh right, because the discount is on the marked price, not on the cost.\n\nSo let me set up an equation. Let's say the marked price is M. He gives a 20% discount on M, so the selling price is M - 20% of M, which is 80% of M. So 0.8 * M = 1440. I need to solve for M.\n\nSo M = 1440 / 0.8. Let me do that calculation. 1440 divided by 0.8. Hmm, 0.8 is 4/5, so dividing by 4/5 is the same as multiplying by 5/4. 1440 * 5 = 7200, divided by 4 is 1800. So M is 1800.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option E is 1800. But wait, I thought the answer was higher. Let me double-check my steps. Oh wait, no, that seems right. Let me go through again.\n\nCost price is 1200. Desired profit is 20%, so selling price should be 1200 * 1.2 = 1440. Then, 1440 is 80% of the marked price. So 1440 = 0.8 * M. So M = 1440 / 0.8 = 1800.\n\nWait, but another way: If he sells it at 1440, that's after a 20% discount, so the marked price must be higher. Let me think, 20% discount on M gives 80% of M as the selling price. So M is 1800, which is option E. But I thought maybe the options have 1800 as E, but I'm seeing the options given here as A)1,879, B)1,875, C)1,876, D)1,872, E)1,800. So E is 1800.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes profit is calculated differently. Like, sometimes it's based on selling price, but I think in this case, it's based on cost because the question says \"makes 20% profit\". So yeah, that should be based on cost.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check 1440 divided by 0.8. 0.8 is 4/5, so 1440 *5 = 7200, divided by 4 is 1800. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the correct marked price is 1800, which is option E.\n",

The cost price is Rs. 1200, and he wants to make a 20% profit even after giving a 20% discount. Hmm, I need to figure out what the marked price should be.\n\nLet me think about how this works. So, when he sells it after a discount, he wants to make 20% profit on the cost price. So first, I should calculate what his selling price needs to be to achieve that profit.\n\nThe cost price is Rs. 1200. A 20% profit on that would be 20% of 1200. Let me calculate that. 20% is 0.2, so 0.2 * 1200 equals 240. So the selling price should be 1200 + 240, which is 1440. So he needs to sell it for Rs. 1440 after the discount.\n\nBut wait, the selling price is after giving a 20% discount. So the marked price is higher than the selling price. Because when you give a discount, the selling price is a percentage of the marked price. \n\nLet me denote the marked price as M. The discount is 20%, so the selling price is 80% of M. Because if you take away 20%, you're left with 80%. So, 80% of M equals the desired selling price of 1440.\n\nMathematically, that would be 0.8 * M = 1440. To find M, I can rearrange this: M = 1440 / 0.8.\n\nCalculating that, 1440 divided by 0.8. Let me do this step by step. 1440 divided by 8 is 180, because 8 times 180 is 1440. But since it's 0.8, which is 8 tenths, the division by 0.8 is the same as multiplying by 10/8. Wait, maybe another approach: 0.8 is 4/5. So 1440 divided by (4/5) is the same as 1440 multiplied by 5/4.\n\nSo 1440 * 5 is 7200, divided by 4 is 1800. Oh, that's a neat way. So M is 1800.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option E is 1800. So that's one of the choices.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the options have some numbers around 1800. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nSo, desired selling price after 20% discount is 1440. That comes from 20% profit on cost. Cost is 1200, so 20% is 240, so 1200 + 240 = 1440.\n\nNow, 20% discount on the marked price M means selling price is 80% of M. So 0.8 * M = 1440.\n\nSolving for M: M = 1440 / 0.8. Let me compute that: 1440 divided by 0.8.\n\nAnother way to think: 0.8 is the same as 4/5. So 1440 divided by (4/5) is 1440 * (5/4) = (1440 /4 ) *5 = 360 *5= 1800.\n\nYes, so M is 1800.
