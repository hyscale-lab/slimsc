      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a rectangular solid inscribed in a sphere. Hmm, I remember that when a solid is inscribed in a sphere, all its vertices lie on the sphere's surface. The solid is 3 x 4 x 15, and I need to find the diameter of the sphere.\n\nWait, the diameter would be twice the radius, right? But how do I find the radius? Oh, right! For a rectangular solid, the diagonal of the solid is the diameter of the sphere it's inscribed in. So I need to calculate the space diagonal of the solid.\n\nThe formula for the space diagonal (d) of a rectangular solid with sides a, b, c is d = sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2). So I should plug in the given dimensions.\n\nLet me compute that. The sides are 3, 4, and 15.\n\nFirst, square each side:\n3\u00b2 = 9,\n4\u00b2 = 16,\n15\u00b2 = 225.\n\nAdding them together: 9 + 16 is 25, and 25 + 225 is 250. So the diagonal squared is 250.\n\nTaking the square root of 250. Hmm, what's sqrt(250)? Let me think. I know that 15\u00b2 is 225 and 16\u00b2 is 256. So sqrt(250) is between 15 and 16. Let's calculate it more accurately.\n\n250 = 25 * 10. So sqrt(25*10) = 5*sqrt(10). Oh wait, sqrt(10) is approximately 3.16227766. So 5 * 3.16227766 is about 15.8113883.\n\nSo the space diagonal is approximately 15.8113883 units. Since the diameter of the sphere is the same as the space diagonal, that's the value I'm looking for.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 15.8113. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me redo the squares:\n\n3^2 = 9, yes. 4^2=16, right. 15^2 is 225. 9+16=25, 25+225=250. Yep, that's correct. So sqrt(250) is about 15.8113. So B is the right choice.\n",
