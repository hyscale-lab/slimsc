      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Vinit buying an article during a sale. The question is asking for the actual selling price before the discount. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nAlright, the problem says there was a 20% discount on all articles. Vinit bought one for Rs.4578. Wait, is that the price after the discount? I think so because that's how discounts usually work\u2014 the sale price is after the discount is applied. So, the Rs.4578 must be the amount he paid after getting 20% off.\n\nSo, if the discount is 20%, that means Vinit paid 80% of the original price. Because 100% minus 20% is 80%. Right, so the sale price is 80% of the original price.\n\nLet me denote the original price as 'x'. Then, according to the problem, 80% of x equals 4578. So the equation would be 0.8 * x = 4578.\n\nTo find x, I need to divide both sides by 0.8. So x = 4578 / 0.8. Let me calculate that. Hmm, dividing by 0.8 is the same as multiplying by 5/4. So 4578 * 5 = 22890, and then divided by 4 would be 5722.5. Wait, that's 5722.5, but the options are all whole numbers. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nLet me try another approach. 4578 divided by 0.8. Let's see: 4578 \u00f7 0.8. Well, 0.8 is 4/5, so dividing by 4/5 is the same as multiplying by 5/4. So 4578 * 5 = 22890, then 22890 \u00f74. Let me compute that. 22890 \u00f74: 4 goes into 22 five times (20), remainder 2. Bring down 8, making 28. 4 into 28 is 7. Then 9 divided by 4 is 2, remainder 1. Bring down 0, making 10. 4 into 10 is 2, remainder 2. Then bring down the next 0, making 20. 4 into 20 is 5. So putting it all together: 5722.5. Oh, same result. So that's 5722.5, which isn't an option here. The options are A)5050, B)5723, C)5040, D)4950, E)4870.\n\nWait, option B is 5723. But my calculation gave 5722.5, which is 5722.5, so that rounds to 5723 if we're considering whole rupees. So the original price would be 5723, right?\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I miscalculated. Let me compute 4578 * 5 /4.\n\nWait, 4578 divided by 0.8 is equal to 4578 * 1.25, because 1/0.8 is 1.25. So 4578 * 1.25.\n\nLet me compute that: 4578 * 1 is 4578, 4578 * 0.25 is 1144.5. Adding them together gives 4578 + 1144.5 = 5722.5. Same as before.\n\nSo the original price is 5722.5, which is 5722.50 rupees. Since the options don't have fractions, the closest would be 5723. So option B is s.5723.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, B is 5723. So that must be the correct answer. Let me make sure the other options don't fit. Option C is 5040, which is lower than the original price. So that can't be right because the discount is 20%, so the selling price is lower. So the original price should be higher than 4578. So the options A, C, D, E are all lower than 5722.5, but wait, no. Wait, the original price is higher than the sale price. So 5722.5 is higher than 4578, which makes sense. So the options are:\n\nA)5050 \u2013 that's less than 5722.5. So no.\n\nB)5723 \u2013 yes, that's close.\n\nC)5040 \u2013 no.\n\nD)4950 \u2013 no.\n\nE)4870 \u2013 no.\n\nSo the correct answer is option B.\n",

Because the discount is 20%, which means Vinit paid 80% of the original price.\n\nWait, let me think. So if the discount is 20%, then the customer pays 100% - 20% = 80% of the original price. So the selling price (SP) after discount is 80% of the original price (let's call it OP). So SP = OP * (80/100) or 0.8 * OP.\n\nBut in this case, the SP is given as Rs.4578. So OP must be higher than that. So the formula would be OP = SP / 0.8.\n\nLet me compute that. 4578 divided by 0.8. Hmm, how to calculate that. Alternatively, I can think of it as multiplying by 10/8, since 0.8 is 4/5, so 1/0.8 is 5/4 which is 1.25. So OP = 4578 * 1.25.\n\nLet me compute 4578 * 1.25. Let's break it down. 4578 * 1 is 4578, and 4578 * 0.25 is a quarter of that. What's a quarter of 4578? 4578 /4. Let's see, 4500 divided by 4 is 1125, and 78 divided by 4 is 19.5. So 1125 +19.5 = 1144.5. So 0.25 times 4578 is 1144.5. Adding that to 4578: 4578 + 1144.5 = 5722.5. Wait, but looking at the options, the closest number is option B, which is 5723. Oh wait, but 5722.5 would round to 5723 if we're talking about whole rupees. So that's probably the correct option.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculation to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So 4578 * 1.25. Another way to compute this is to think of 1.25 as 5/4. So 4578 *5 /4. Let's do 4578 *5 first. 4578 *5: 4000*5=20,000; 500*5=2,500; 70*5=350; 8*5=40. So adding them up: 20,000 + 2,500 is 22,500. 22,500 + 350 is 22,850. 22,850 +40 is 22,890. Now, divide that by 4. 22,890 \u00f74. Let's see, 22,890 divided by 4: 22,000 \u00f74 is 5,500. 890 \u00f74 is 222.5. So total is 5,500 +222.5 =5,722.5. Yes, same as before. So 5,722.5, which is 5,723 when rounded to the nearest whole number. So the original price was Rs.5723.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 5723. So that should be the correct answer.\n",
