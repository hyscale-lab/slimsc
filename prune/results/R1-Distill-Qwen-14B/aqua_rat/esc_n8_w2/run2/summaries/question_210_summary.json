      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Shweta riding her bike or maybe a vehicle. Let me read it again. She rides at 10 km per hour, but she stops for 10 minutes every time she covers 15 km. And the question is, how long will she take to cover 100 km? The options are from A to E, with 9 to 13 hours.\n\nHmm, right. So first, I think I need to figure out how much time she spends actually riding and how much time she spends resting. Because every time she completes 15 km, she stops for 10 minutes. So I'll have to calculate the total riding time and then add the rest periods.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think. So, she rides 15 km, then stops. Then she rides another 15 km, stops again, and so on. But wait, she needs to cover 100 km. So how many such 15 km segments are there in 100 km? Let me calculate that.\n\nSo, 100 divided by 15. Let's see, 15 *6 is 90, 15*7 is 105. So she can't complete 7 segments because that's more than 100. So she has 6 full segments of 15 km each, which is 90 km, and then a remaining 10 km. So in that case, after each 15 km, she stops, except maybe the last one?\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me think again. Each time she rides 15 km, she stops. But when she's done with the last part, does she stop again? Hmm, the problem says she stops at the end of every 15 km. So if the total is 100 km, after 90 km (6 segments), she has 10 km left. So she rides 10 km, but since that's less than 15, she doesn't stop after that. So she only stops after every 15 km, which in this case, she stops 6 times.\n\nWait, wait, let me make sure. Let's say she rides 15 km, stops. Then another 15, stops. So after each 15 km, she stops. So for 100 km, she's done 6 times 15 km, which is 90, and then 10 km. So the stops would be after each 15 km. So the number of stops is 6. Because after the 6th 15 km, she's at 90, and then she rides another 10 km to reach 100. So she doesn't stop after the last 10 km. So 6 stops in total.\n\nSo now, each riding segment is 15 km, and she rides at 10 km/h. So the time for each 15 km is 15/10 hours. 15 divided by 10 is 1.5 hours, which is 90 minutes. So each segment takes 1.5 hours, and then a 10-minute break.\n\nWait, but wait. So for 6 segments, the riding time is 6 * 1.5 hours. Let me calculate that. 6 times 1.5 is 9 hours. And then the breaks: 6 breaks, each 10 minutes. So 6 *10 =60 minutes, which is 1 hour. So total time would be 9 +1=10 hours.\n\nWait, but wait. Oh, but wait, wait. The last segment is only 10 km. So I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recast the problem.\n\nWait, the 100 km is made up of 6 segments of 15 km and one of 10 km. So the number of stops is 6, right? Because each 15 km she stops, and the last part is 10 km, so no stop after that.\n\nSo the riding time is 6 segments of 15 km and one of 10 km. So each 15 km takes 1.5 hours, so 6 *1.5 is 9 hours. The 10 km takes 10/10=1 hour. So riding time is 9 +1=10 hours. Then the breaks: 6 breaks, each 10 minutes, so 6*0.166666 hours (since 10 minutes is 1/6 of an hour) is 1 hour. So total time is 10 +1=11 hours.\n\nWait, so that's 10 hours riding and 1 hour resting, total 11 hours. So the answer would be option C, which is 11 hours.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this step by step. Let's list each segment:\n\n1. 15 km: time = 1.5 hours, then 10 min stop. So after this, she's at 15 km, time so far 1.5 +0.166666= approx 1.6667 hours.\n\n2. Next 15 km: another 1.5 hours, then stop. Total so far: 3.3333 hours.\n\n3. Third 15 km: 1.5 hours, stop. Total: 5 hours.\n\n4. Fourth 15 km: 1.5 hours, stop. Total: 6.6667 hours.\n\n5. Fifth 15 km: 1.5 hours, stop. Total: 8.3333 hours.\n\n6. Sixth 15 km: 1.5 hours, stop. Now, she's at 90 km. Time so far: 10 hours.\n\nNow, she needs to cover 10 more km. So she rides 10 km at 10 km/h, which takes 1 hour. No stop after this because it's less than 15 km.\n\nSo the riding time is 6*1.5 +1=10 hours. The stops are 6*10 minutes=60 minutes=1 hour. So total time 10 +1=11 hours.\n\nSo the answer is C) 11 hours.\n",

Shweta rides at 10 km per hour, but she stops for 10 minutes after every 15 km to rest. The question is asking how many hours she'll take to cover 100 km. The options are from A to E, with various hours listed.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to figure out how long she spends riding and how many rest stops she makes along the way. Since she stops after every 15 km, I should calculate how many such segments she'll cover in 100 km.\n\nWait, so 100 divided by 15. Let me do that: 15 times 6 is 90, and 15 times 7 is 105. Oh wait, that's more than 100. So she'll have 6 full segments of 15 km each, which makes 90 km. Then there's the remaining 10 km to reach 100 km. So she'll have 6 rest stops, right? Because after each 15 km, she rests. But wait, after the 6th 15 km, she has 10 km left. Does she stop after that? No, because she only stops after every 15 km. So she stops 6 times, each time for 10 minutes.\n\nWait, but wait again. Let me think. When she reaches 15 km, she stops. Then 30, 45, etc. So after 15 km, stop. Then another 15, another stop. So for 100 km, how many 15 km segments are there? Let's see: 100 divided by 15 is approximately 6.666. So that's 6 full segments, and a partial one. So she will stop 6 times because she only stops after completing each 15 km.\n\nWait, but after the last segment (the 10 km), she doesn't stop because it's not a 15 km segment. So yes, 6 stops.\n\nNow, each stop is 10 minutes. So total rest time is 6 * 10 minutes = 60 minutes, which is 1 hour.\n\nNext, the time she spends riding. She covers 100 km at 10 km per hour. So the time is 100 km divided by 10 km/h = 10 hours.\n\nSo total time is riding time plus rest time: 10 hours + 1 hour = 11 hours.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recalculate the number of stops.\n\nEach 15 km requires a stop. So:\n\n15 km: stop 1\n30 km: stop 2\n45 km: stop 3\n60 km: stop 4\n75 km: stop 5\n90 km: stop 6\n\nAfter 90 km, she has 10 km left. So she doesn't stop again. So 6 stops total, each 10 minutes. 6*10=60 mins =1h.\n\nRiding time: 100 km at 10 km/h is 10h.\n\nTotal time: 10 +1 =11h.\n\nSo the answer should be option C) 11 hours.\n",
