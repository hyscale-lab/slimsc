      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about which side is left unfenced. Let me think. The yard is rectangular, so it has two equal lengths and two equal widths. Let's say the sides are length and width.\n\nWait, the problem says she leaves one side of 10 meters unfenced. So, does that mean one of the lengths or one of the widths is 10 meters? Or is it that the total length of one side is 10 meters? Because if she's leaving a side unfenced, that side must be either length or width.\n\nSo, the area is 240 square meters. Let me note down the given information.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- Let\u2019s say the side that's left unfenced is the width, which is 10 meters. So, the width (w) is 10 m. Then the length (l) can be calculated because area is length times width.\n\nArea = l * w\n240 = l * 10\nSo, l = 240 / 10 = 24 meters.\n\nWait, but if she's fencing three sides, which sides would that be? If the unfenced side is a width, then she would need fencing for the other width and both lengths. So, the fencing required would be: length + length + width. Or wait, wait, wait. Wait, the yard is a rectangle. So, if she's leaving one side unfenced, which is 10 meters, that side could be a length or a width.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that she's leaving one side of 10 meters unfenced. So, that side is either length or width. Let's try both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: Unfenced side is a width (w) =10 m.\n\nThen, area is l * w =240 \u2192 l=24 m.\n\nShe needs fencing for two widths and one length? Wait, no. Wait, she's fencing three sides. So, if she's leaving a width (10 m) unfenced, then the other three sides are the two lengths and the other width. So fencing needed is 2l + w.\n\nWait, no. Because in a rectangle, the opposite sides are equal. So if one width is unfenced, the opposite width would be fenced. Wait, no, she's only fencing three sides. So, if the yard is a rectangle, and she leaves one side (width) unfenced, then she must be fencing the other width and the two lengths. Wait, that would be three sides. Let me visualize this: imagine the yard as a rectangle with width on the left and right. If she leaves the left side (width) unfenced, then she needs fencing for the right width, the top length, and the bottom length. So, total fencing would be: w (right side) + l (top) + l (bottom). So, that's 2l + w.\n\nIn this case, w=10, l=24. So fencing is 2*24 +10 =48+10=58 meters. Hmm, option A is 58.\n\nBut wait, let's check the other case. What if the unfenced side is a length?\n\nCase 2: Unfenced side is a length (l)=10 m.\n\nThen, area is l * w =240 \u2192 w=240/10=24 m.\n\nShe needs fencing for the two lengths and the other width? No, wait, three sides. If she leaves a length (10 m) unfenced, she would need fencing for the other length, and the two widths. So fencing would be: l + 2w.\n\nSo, l=10, w=24.\n\nFencing is 10 + 2*24 =10+48=58 meters. Same as before.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So regardless of whether the unfenced side is a length or a width, the total fencing required is 58 meters? Because in both cases, the fencing is 58.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Let me re-express.\n\nWait, in case 1: unfenced is a width (10m). Fencing is 2 lengths + 1 width. So, 2*24 +10=58.\n\nIn case 2: unfenced is a length (10m). Fencing is 2 widths + 1 length. 2*24 +10=58.\n\nSo in both scenarios, it's 58. So the answer should be A)58.\n\nBut looking at the options, option A is 58. So that's the correct answer.\n",
