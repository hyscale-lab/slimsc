      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a coin diver who gets paid for bringing up coins from a river. The question is asking for the minimum number of copper coins she could have brought up, given that she earned $3.40 after one dive. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll restate the problem in my own words. The diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin. Her total earnings from one dive are $3.40, which is 340 cents. I need to find the smallest number of copper coins she could have brought up.\n\nHmm, so I'll set up some variables. Let me say:\n- Let c = number of copper coins.\n- Let b = number of brass coins.\n\nThe total money she earned would be 20c + 25b cents. And that equals 340 cents. So the equation is 20c + 25b = 340.\n\nMy goal is to find the minimum value of c, which is the number of copper coins. Since we're dealing with coins, both c and b must be non-negative integers (you can't have a negative number of coins or a fraction of a coin).\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to express one variable in terms of the other and then look for integer solutions. Let's try to solve for b in terms of c.\n\nFrom the equation:\n20c + 25b = 340.\n\nI can subtract 20c from both sides to get 25b = 340 - 20c. Then, divide both sides by 5 to simplify:\n5b = 68 - 4c.\n\nSo, 5b = 68 - 4c. That means that 68 -4c must be divisible by 5 because b has to be an integer. So 68 -4c \u2261 0 mod 5.\n\nLet me think about the modular arithmetic here. 68 mod 5 is 3 because 5*13=65, 68-65=3. So 3 -4c \u2261 0 mod 5. Which can be rewritten as (-4c) \u2261 -3 mod 5, or 4c \u2261 3 mod5.\n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check that. So 68-4c \u22610 mod5 \u2192 (68 mod5) - (4c mod5) \u22610. 68 mod5 is 3, so 3 - (4c mod5) \u22610. So, 4c mod5 \u22613.\n\nSo, 4c \u22613 mod5. I need to find c such that when multiplied by 4 gives a remainder of 3 when divided by 5.\n\nLet me think about the possible values of c modulo 5. Because 4 and 5 are coprime, there's a unique solution mod5.\n\nSo, I can write 4c \u22613 mod5. To find c, I can find the multiplicative inverse of 4 mod5. Since 4*4=16, which is 1 mod5, so the inverse of 4 is 4.\n\nMultiply both sides by 4: c \u2261 3*4 mod5 \u2192 c \u226112 mod5 \u2192 c\u22612 mod5.\n\nSo c must be congruent to 2 modulo 5. Which means possible values for c are 2,7,12,... etc. But since we're looking for the minimum number of copper coins, the smallest possible c is 2. But wait, wait. Let's not jump to conclusions yet. Because the number of coins can't be negative, so c has to be at least 0, but in this case, the modular solution suggests c can be 2,7, etc. But let's check if c=2 is possible.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me go back. So c must be such that 4c \u22613 mod5. Let me test c=2: 4*2=8. 8 mod5 is 3. Yep, that works. So c can be 2,7,12, etc.\n\nBut I need the minimal c, so let's try c=2. Let's plug c=2 into the equation 20c +25b =340.\n\n20*2=40. So 40 +25b =340 \u219225b=300 \u2192b=12. So that's possible. So with c=2, b=12.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the minimum number of copper coins. So 2 is a possible answer, but let me check if a smaller c is possible. Because perhaps c=2 is the minimum, but maybe there's a way to have c=0. Let me see.\n\nIf c=0, then 25b=340. 340/25=13.6. Which is not an integer, so b can't be 13.6. So c=0 is not possible.\n\nWhat about c=1? Let's check. 20*1=20. So 25b=340-20=320. 320/25=12.8. Again, not an integer. So c=1 isn't possible either.\n\nSo the next possible c is 2. But wait, earlier I thought c must be 2 mod5, so next is 2,7,12, etc. So c=2 is possible, but let's see if any smaller c (like 0 or 1) is possible. But from the calculations, c=0 and c=1 don't yield integer b.\n\nWait, but let's think again about the equation 20c +25b =340. I can factor out 5: 5*(4c +5b)=5*68 \u21924c +5b=68.\n\nSo 4c +5b=68. Now, I'm trying to find non-negative integers c and b such that this holds. I need to find the minimal c.\n\nLet me approach this by iterating through possible c values starting from 0.\n\nc=0 \u21925b=68 \u2192b=13.6 \u2192invalid.\nc=1 \u21924(1) +5b=68 \u21925b=64 \u2192b=12.8 \u2192invalid.\nc=2 \u21924*2=8 \u21925b=60 \u2192b=12 \u2192valid.

So 20*17=340, which is exactly the total. So that's another solution.\n\nSo the possible c values where b is integer are 2,7,12,17. And so on, but since we're looking for the minimal c, 2 is the smallest possible.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about the modular solution, c must be 2 mod5, so possible c's are 2,7,12, etc. So 2 is the minimal c.\n\nWait, but let me check: when c=2, b=12. That's a valid solution. So that's the minimal c.\n\nSo the minimum number of copper coins is 2. So the answer should be option C)2.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Because I might have missed something.\n\nWait, another way to approach this: Let's express the equation as 4c = 68 -5b.\n\nSo 4c =68-5b.\n\nSince 4c must be non-negative, 68-5b \u22650 \u21925b \u226468 \u2192b \u226413.6 \u2192b can be up to 13.\n\nWe're looking for integer b such that 68-5b is divisible by4.\n\nBecause 4c must be an integer. So 68-5b must be divisible by4.\n\nSo 68 mod4 is 0 (because 4*17=68). So 5b must also be \u22610 mod4.\n\nBecause 68-5b \u22610 mod4 \u21925b \u226168 mod4 \u2192since 68 mod4=0 \u21925b mod4=0.\n\n5 mod4 is 1, so 5b mod4 = (1*b) mod4 = b mod4.\n\nSo for 5b \u22610 mod4, b must be \u22610 mod4.\n\nSo b must be a multiple of 4.\n\nSo possible b values are 0,4,8,12.\n\nLet's test these:\n\nb=12: 5b=60 \u21924c=68-60=8 \u2192c=2 \u2192valid.\nb=8: 5*8=40 \u21924c=68-40=28 \u2192c=7 \u2192valid.\nb=4:5*4=20 \u21924c=48 \u2192c=12 \u2192valid.\nb=0:5*0=0 \u21924c=68 \u2192c=17 \u2192valid.\n\nSo the possible c values are 2,7,12,17.\n\nSo the minimal c is 2.\n\nWait, but what if b=16? Wait, no, because earlier we saw that b can't be more than 13. So b=12 is the maximum possible here.\n\nSo yes, c=2 is the minimal number of copper coins.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a coin diver who gets paid for bringing up copper and brass coins. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nSo the problem says she gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin. After one dive, she earned $3.40. We need to find the minimum number of copper coins she could have brought up.\n\nHmm, I think I should start by converting the total money into cents to make the calculations easier. Since $1 is 100 cents, $3.40 would be 340 cents. That makes the equation easier to handle without dealing with dollars and cents.\n\nLet me denote the number of copper coins as 'c' and the number of brass coins as 'b'. So each copper coin gives 20c, and each brass gives 25b. The total would be 20c + 25b = 340 cents.\n\nThe question asks for the minimum number of copper coins. So I need to find the smallest possible 'c' such that both 'c' and 'b' are non-negative integers. Because you can't have a negative number of coins, right?\n\nLet me rearrange the equation to solve for one variable. Let's solve for 'b' in terms of 'c'. So:\n\n25b = 340 - 20c\nb = (340 - 20c) / 25\n\nSince 'b' has to be an integer, (340 - 20c) must be divisible by 25. Let me see what that implies.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the equation modulo 5, since 20 and 25 are both multiples of 5. Let's see:\n\n20c +25b =340\nDividing both sides by 5:\n4c +5b = 68\n\nSo now the equation is 4c +5b =68. Now, I need to find integers c and b >=0 such that this holds.\n\nWe can express this as 5b = 68 -4c\n=> b = (68 -4c)/5\n\nSince b must be an integer, (68-4c) must be divisible by 5. So 68 -4c \u2261 0 mod5.\n\nLet's compute 68 mod5. 5*13=65, so 68-65=3. So 68 \u22613 mod5. So 3 -4c \u22610 mod5.\n\nWhich implies, -4c \u2261 -3 mod5. Multiply both sides by -1: 4c \u22613 mod5.\n\nNow, I need to find c such that 4c mod5 is 3. Let's think about possible values of c.\n\nSince 4 and 5 are coprime, each c will give a unique value mod5. Let's find c where 4c mod5 is 3.\n\nLet me list possible c modulo5 and compute 4c mod5.\n\nc mod5 | 4c mod5\n0      | 0\n1      |4\n2      |8\u21923 (since 8-5=3)\n3      |12\u21922\n4      |16\u21921\n\nAh, so when c \u22612 mod5, 4c mod5 is 3. So c must be congruent to 2 modulo5. That is, c can be 2,7,12, etc. But since we're looking for the minimum number of copper coins, let's start with the smallest possible c, which is 2.\n\nWait, but let's check if c=2 works. Plugging back into 4c +5b=68:\n\n4*2 =8 \u21925b=68-8=60 \u2192b=12. So b=12, which is an integer. So that's valid. So c=2 is possible.\n\nWait, but let me check if c=2 is the minimum. What about c=0? Because maybe c can be even smaller. Let me test c=0.\n\nc=0: 4*0=0 \u21925b=68 \u2192b=13.6, which isn't an integer. So that's not possible.\n\nc=1: 4*1=4 \u21925b=64 \u2192b=12.8 \u2192 no, not integer.\n\nc=2: works, as above.\n\nc=3: 4*3=12 \u21925b=56 \u2192b=11.2 \u2192 no.\n\nc=4: 4*4=16 \u21925b=52 \u2192b=10.4 \u2192 no.\n\nc=5:4*5=20 \u21925b=48 \u2192b=9.6 \u2192nope.\n\nc=6:4*6=24 \u21925b=44 \u2192b=8.8 \u2192 no.\n\nc=7:4*7=28 \u21925b=40 \u2192b=8. So that's possible. c=7 and b=8.\n\nBut since we're looking for the minimum c, the smallest c possible is 2.\n\nSo the minimum number of copper coins is 2.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Could c be smaller than 2? Let's see:\n\nc=0: no, as before.\n\nc=1: no.\n\nSo the next possible c is 2, which works. So the answer should be 2, which is option C.\n",
