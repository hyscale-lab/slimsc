      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about making bouquets with white and red tulips. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that we have 28 white tulips and 98 red ones. We need to make as many identical bouquets as possible without leaving any flowers out. Identical bouquets mean each has the same number of white and red tulips.\n\nHmm, right. So the key here is to find the maximum number of bouquets where each bouquet uses some white and red tulips. Since all the flowers must be used, the total number of white and red tulips in all bouquets should add up exactly to 28 and 98 respectively.\n\nWait, so maybe I should think in terms of factors. Because the number of bouquets has to divide both the white and red tulip counts without any leftovers. Oh right, so the number of bouquets is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 28 and 98. Because the GCD is the largest number that can divide both numbers exactly.\n\nLet me calculate the GCD of 28 and 98. So, factors of 28 are 1,2,4,7,14,28. For 98, the factors are 1,2,7,14,49,98. The common factors are 1,2,7,14. The greatest is 14. Wait, but wait. If the GCD is 14, does that mean we can make 14 bouquets? Let me check.\n\nIf each bouquet has x white tulips, then 14 bouquets would mean x *14 =28. So x=2. Similarly, for red, y *14=98. So y=7. So each bouquet has 2 white and 7 red tulips. That adds up perfectly. 2*14=28 whites, 7*14=98 reds. So that works.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Are there any other possible numbers higher than 14? The options include 21, which is higher. Let's see: 21 is a divisor of 28? No, because 28 divided by 21 is about 1.333, which isn't an integer. So 21 can't be the number because 28 isn't divisible by 21. So 14 is the maximum.\n\nWait, but wait another thought: 28 and 98, their GCD is indeed 14. Because 28 is 2*2*7, and 98 is 2*7*7. So the common factors are 2 and 7, multiplied together gives 14. Yep, so 14 is the GCD.\n\nSo the maximum number of identical bouquets is 14. Looking back at the options, option D is 14.\n",

This requires finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers, 28 and 98.\n\nThe factors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 28. The factors of 98 are 1, 2, 7, 14, 49, and 98. The common factors are 1, 2, 7, and 14, with the greatest being 14. Therefore, the GCD of 28 and 98 is 14.\n\nThis means we can make 14 identical bouquets.

The question is asking for the greatest number of identical bouquets we can make without leaving any flowers unused. Hmm, right. Let me break this down.\n\nSo, the total number of white tulips is 28, and red ones are 98. We need to make bouquets that are identical, which means each bouquet must have the same number of white and red tulips. Also, every flower has to be used, so nothing's left behind.\n\nWait, so the key here is probably to find the maximum number of bouquets, let's call that number 'b'. Each bouquet would then have a certain number of white and red tulips. So for white, each bouquet would have 28 divided by b, and for red, 98 divided by b. But since the number of tulips in each bouquet has to be a whole number, both 28 and 98 must be perfectly divisible by b. Oh, right! So b has to be a common divisor of both 28 and 98.\n\nSo I think the approach here is to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 28 and 98. Because the GCD is the largest number that divides both without leaving a remainder. Once we find that, that should be the maximum number of bouquets we can make.\n\nLet me think about how to compute the GCD of 28 and 98. I remember that the Euclidean algorithm is a good method for this. So let's apply that.\n\nFirst, divide 98 by 28. 28 times 3 is 84, which is less than 98. Subtract 84 from 98, and the remainder is 14. So now, we take 28 and divide by the remainder 14. 14 times 2 is 28, which gives a remainder of 0. So the last non-zero remainder is 14, which is the GCD.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Does that mean the maximum number of bouquets is 14? Let me check the options. Option D is 14. But I should make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nWait, let me think again. So 28 divided by 14 is 2, and 98 divided by 14 is 7. So each bouquet would have 2 white and 7 red tulips. That uses all 28 white (14*2=28) and all 98 red (14*7=98). That works perfectly. So 14 bouquets would use up all the flowers without leftovers.\n\nAlternatively, I can list the factors of both numbers to see if 14 is indeed the greatest. Let's see.\n\nFactors of 28: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28.\n\nFactors of 98: 1, 2, 7, 14, 49, 98.\n\nThe common factors are 1, 2, 7, 14. The largest is 14. So yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. The question is about the number of bouquets. So the answer should be 14, which is option D. But I'm seeing that 28 and 98 are both multiples of 14, so 14 bouquets is the maximum possible.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. So the correct option is D.\n",
