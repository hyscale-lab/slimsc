      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a retailer selling an appliance. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says the retailer sold it for 40 percent above cost, and that 40 percent represented a gross profit of $20.00. I need to find the selling price.\n\nWait, wait. I'm a bit confused. Let me break it down. So, the cost price is the amount the retailer paid for the appliance. They sold it at 40% above that cost. The difference between the selling price and the cost is the gross profit, which is $20.\n\nOh right, so the gross profit is 40% of the cost. Because the selling price is 40% higher than the cost. So if I let the cost be 'C', then the selling price is C + 0.40*C, which is 1.40*C.\n\nAnd the profit is the selling price minus cost, so that's 0.40*C. According to the problem, that profit is $20. So 0.40*C = $20.\n\nHmm, so I can solve for C. Let me do that. C = $20 / 0.40. Let's calculate that. 20 divided by 0.4 is 50. So the cost is $50.\n\nNow, the selling price is 40% above cost, which is 1.4 times C. So that would be 1.4 * 50. Let's see, 50 times 1.4 is... 70. So the selling price is $70.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is $70.00. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If the cost is $50, then 40% of that is 20, so the selling price is 50+20=70. Yep, that makes sense. So the retailer sold it for $70.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem states that the retailer sold an appliance for 40% above its cost, resulting in a gross profit of $20.00.

Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nThe question says that a retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, and that this represented a gross profit of $20.00. I need to find out the selling price. The options are given, so maybe I can work through it.\n\nHmm, okay, so first, let's understand the terms. The cost is what the retailer paid for the appliance. Selling price is what they sold it for. The profit is the difference between selling price and cost. Gross profit here is $20.\n\nThe problem states that the selling price is 40% above the cost. So if the cost is C, then the selling price is C plus 40% of C, which is 1.4 times C, right? So selling price (SP) = 1.4 * C.\n\nBut wait, the profit is given as $20. Profit is SP minus cost. So SP = C + 20. But from the first part, SP is also 1.4*C. So I can set up an equation:\n\n1.4 * C = C + 20\n\nHmm, let's solve for C. Subtract C from both sides:\n\n1.4C - C = 20 \u2192 0.4C = 20 \u2192 C = 20 / 0.4 \u2192 C = 50.\n\nSo the cost is $50. Then the selling price is 1.4 times that, which is 1.4 *50 = $70.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If cost is $50, then 40% of that is 0.4*50=20. So selling price is 50+20=70, which matches. And the profit is 20, which is correct.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is $70. So that must be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. Sometimes, percentage calculations can be tricky. Let me try another approach. The profit is 40% of cost. Because the selling price is 40% above cost, which implies that the profit is 40% of the cost. So profit = 0.4*C. But the profit is given as $20, so 0.4C =20 \u2192 C=50 again. Selling price is cost plus profit, 50+20=70. Yep, same result.\n\nI think that's solid. So the correct answer should be D) $70.00.\n",
