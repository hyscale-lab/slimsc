      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about the ratio of the volumes of a cube and a sphere that fits inside it. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when a sphere fits perfectly inside a cube, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the edge length of the cube. Right, because the sphere touches all the sides of the cube.\n\nWait, so the sphere's diameter is the same as the cube's edge length. Let me denote the edge length of the cube as 'a'. That would make the diameter of the sphere 'a' as well. So the radius of the sphere would be a/2.\n\nNow, I need to find the volumes of both the cube and the sphere. The volume of the cube is straightforward\u2014it's side length cubed. So that's a\u00b3.\n\nFor the sphere, the volume formula is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3. Since the radius r is a/2, I can plug that into the formula. So the sphere's volume becomes (4/3)\u03c0*(a/2)\u00b3.\n\nLet me compute that. (a/2)\u00b3 is a\u00b3/(2\u00b3) = a\u00b3/8. Multiply that by 4/3\u03c0: (4/3)\u03c0 * (a\u00b3/8) = (4\u03c0 a\u00b3)/(24) which simplifies to (\u03c0 a\u00b3)/6.\n\nWait, so the cube's volume is a\u00b3 and the sphere's is (\u03c0 a\u00b3)/6. The ratio of cube volume to sphere volume would be a\u00b3 : (\u03c0 a\u00b3/6). \n\nI can cancel out the a\u00b3 since it's common to both. So the ratio is 1 : (\u03c0/6). To make it a ratio without fractions, I can multiply both parts by 6. That gives 6 : \u03c0.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the ratio of the cube to the sphere. So cube is 6, sphere is \u03c0. So 6:\u03c0.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 6:\u03c0. So the answer should be D.\n",

Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the scenario. Imagine a cube, and inside it, there's a sphere that just perfectly fits. So the sphere must be touching the cube exactly at the centers of each face. That means the sphere is the largest possible one that can fit inside the cube. \n\nWait, so the sphere's diameter would be equal to the edge length of the cube, right? Because if the sphere touches the centers of the cube's faces, the distance from one face to the opposite face is the cube's edge length, which is the diameter of the sphere. So, if the cube has an edge length 'a', then the sphere's diameter is 'a', making its radius 'a/2'.\n\nNext, I need to find the volumes of both the cube and the sphere and then find their ratio.\n\nThe volume of the cube is straightforward. Since all edges are equal, the volume V_cube is a^3.\n\nFor the sphere, the volume formula is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3. Substituting r as a/2, so the volume V_sphere becomes (4/3)\u03c0*(a/2)^3. Let me calculate that: (a/2)^3 is a\u00b3/(8), so multiplying by 4/3 gives (4/3)*(\u03c0*a\u00b3/8) = (\u03c0*a\u00b3)/6.\n\nNow, the ratio of the cube's volume to the sphere's volume is V_cube : V_sphere. Plugging in the values, that's a^3 : (\u03c0*a\u00b3/6).\n\nWait, since both have a\u00b3, I can simplify the ratio by dividing both by a\u00b3. So, it becomes 1 : (\u03c0/6). But wait, the question is the ratio of cube to sphere, so I think that's correct. But let me double-check.\n\nWait, no, the ratio is cube divided by sphere. So that's (a\u00b3) / ( (\u03c0 a\u00b3)/6 ) = (a\u00b3 * 6) / (\u03c0 a\u00b3) ) = 6/\u03c0. So the ratio is 6 : \u03c0.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 6: \u03c0. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the ratio. Oh yes, the question says cube to sphere, so yes, 6:\u03c0 is correct.\n",
