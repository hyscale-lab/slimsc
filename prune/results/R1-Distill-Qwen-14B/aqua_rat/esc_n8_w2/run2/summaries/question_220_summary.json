      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a worker's wages over a fortnight, which is 15 days. The average wage per day is $90. Hmm, let me think about how averages work. \n\nFirst, I remember that average is the total divided by the number of days. So the total wages for 15 days would be average multiplied by the number of days. So that's 15 times 90. Let me calculate that. 15 * 90 is 1350. So the total wages for the fortnight is $1350.\n\nNow, the problem says that the first 7 days had an average of $87 per day. So the total for those 7 days is 7 times 87. Let me compute that. 7*80 is 560, and 7*7 is 49, so together that's 609. So the first 7 days sum up to $609.\n\nSimilarly, the last 7 days have an average of $92. So that's 7*92. Let me calculate 7*90 is 630, and 7*2 is 14, so 630 +14 is 644. So the last 7 days total $644.\n\nWait a second, the fortnight is 15 days. So the first 7 days, then the 8th day, and then the last 7 days. So the 8th day is the middle day. So to find the wage on the 8th day, I can subtract the totals of the first 7 and the last 7 from the overall total.\n\nSo the total of first 7 is 609, last 7 is 644. Adding those together: 609 + 644 equals... Let me add 600+600=1200, then 9+44=53, so 1200+53=1253.\n\nWait, the overall total is 1350. So subtract 1253 from 1350 to find the 8th day's wage. 1350 minus 1253 is... Let's see, 1350 minus 1250 is 100, then minus 3 more is 97. So the 8th day's wage is $97.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 97. So the answer should be D.\n",

I'm a bit new to these kinds of average problems, but I think I can figure it out.\n\nFirst, the problem says the average wage per day was $90 for the entire 15 days. So, to find the total wages for the fortnight, I should multiply the average by the number of days. Let me write that down: 15 days * $90/day. Let's calculate that. 15 times 90 is 1350. So, the total wages for all 15 days is $1350.\n\nNow, the problem splits this fortnight into three parts: the first 7 days, the 8th day, and the last 7 days. We're given the average wages for the first and last 7 days. The first 7 days had an average of $87 per day. So, their total would be 7 * 87. Let me calculate that. 7 * 80 is 560, and 7*7 is 49, so 560+49=609. So, the first 7 days amount to $609.\n\nSimilarly, the last 7 days have an average of $92. So, 7 * 92. Let's see, 7*90=630, and 7*2=14, so 630+14=644. So, the last 7 days total $644.\n\nNow, the sum of the first 7 and the last 7 days is 609 + 644. Let me add those. 600+600 is 1200, 9+44 is 53, so 1200+53=1253. So, together, the first and last 7 days amount to $1253.\n\nWait, but the total for all 15 days is $1350. So, the remaining must be the 8th day's wage. Because 15 days minus 7 days (first) and 7 days (last) is just the 8th day. Oh right, so the 8th day's wage is the total minus the sum of the first and last 7 days.\n\nSo, 1350 (total) minus 1253 (sum of first and last 7) equals... let me subtract. 1350 - 1253. Hmm, 1350 minus 1200 is 150, then minus 53 more. 150-53 is 97. So, 1350-1253=97. So the wage on the 8th day was $97.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, D is $97. So that must be the answer. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst 7 days: 7*87=609. Correct. Last 7 days:7*92=644. Correct. Sum is 609+644=1253. Correct. Total is 1350. So 1350-1253=97. Yes, that's right. So the answer should be D.\n",
