      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me think about this problem. So, Roy has severe headaches and goes to the doctor, who gives him five tablets. The doctor tells him to take one tablet every 15 minutes. The question is asking how much time it will take Roy to consume all five tablets.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out the timing here. Let me break it down step by step. \n\nHe has five tablets to take, and each is taken every 15 minutes. Wait, but when does he start taking them? Like, does he take the first tablet immediately, then the next one after 15 minutes, and so on? \n\nSo, let's say the first tablet is taken at time zero. Then the second would be at 15 minutes, third at 30 minutes, fourth at 45 minutes, and the fifth at 60 minutes. So that's five tablets, each spaced 15 minutes apart.\n\nWait, but the total time isn't the last tablet's time. Because the first tablet is at 0, then the next at 15. So the time between the first and last is four intervals. Because five tablets would have four gaps between them. So each gap is 15 minutes, so 4 times 15 is 60 minutes. But wait, that's the time from the first to the last. So the total time taken would be 60 minutes. But wait, let me think again.\n\nWait another approach. If he takes one every 15 minutes, how many intervals are there between five tablets? Let's count: first at time 0, then second at 15, third at 30, fourth at 45, fifth at 60. So from the first to the fifth, that's four intervals of 15 minutes each. 4 *15 =60 minutes. So the total time is 60 minutes. So the answer would be E)60 Min.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes people might think it's 5 times 15, which is 75. But that would be the case if each tablet took 15 minutes to take, but no, he's taking one every 15 minutes. So the first one is at time zero, then the next ones follow every 15 minutes. So the last tablet is taken at 60 minutes. So the total time from start to finish is 60 minutes.\n\nLet me visualize it. \n\nTime 0: take first tablet.\n15 mins: second.\n30 mins: third.\n45 mins: fourth.\n60 mins: fifth.\n\nSo from 0 to 60, that's an hour. So the answer is 60 minutes, which is option E.\n",

I need to figure out how long it will take him to take all five tablets. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably consider the timing of each tablet. If he takes one every 15 minutes, that means the first tablet is at time zero. Then the next one 15 minutes later, then another 15 after that, and so on. So let's break it down.\n\nThe first tablet is taken right away, at time 0. The second one at 15 minutes, third at 30, fourth at 45, and fifth at 60 minutes. Wait, wait.
