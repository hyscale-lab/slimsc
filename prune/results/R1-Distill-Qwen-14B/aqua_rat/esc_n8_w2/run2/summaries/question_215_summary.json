      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about mixing soft drinks. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question says that one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water. I need to find out how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink. The options are A to E.\n\nWait, so initially, in one gallon, 40% is orange juice. That means the amount of orange juice is 0.4 gallons, and water is 0.6 gallons. Right, because 40% of 1 gallon is 0.4, and 60% is 0.6.\n\nBut the goal is to have orange juice make up 60% of the new mixture. So I need to add more orange juice to this one gallon, and see how much that new total will require.\n\nLet me think about variables. Let's say I add x gallons of orange juice. So the total volume after adding will be 1 gallon (original) + x gallons (added) = (1 + x) gallons.\n\nNow, the amount of orange juice in the mixture will be 0.4 gallons (from the original) plus x gallons (added), so total orange juice is (0.4 + x) gallons.\n\nWe want this orange juice to be 60% of the total mixture. So the equation should be:\n\n(0.4 + x) = 0.6 * (1 + x)\n\nWait, that makes sense. Let me write that out:\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6(1 + x)\n\nLet me solve this equation. Expanding the right side: 0.6 * 1 is 0.6, and 0.6 * x is 0.6x. So:\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x\n\nHmm, I need to get all the x terms on one side and constants on the other. Subtract 0.6x from both sides:\n\n0.4 + x - 0.6x = 0.6\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n0.4 + 0.4x = 0.6\n\nNow, subtract 0.4 from both sides:\n\n0.4x = 0.6 - 0.4\n0.4x = 0.2\n\nDivide both sides by 0.4:\n\nx = 0.2 / 0.4\nx = 0.5\n\nSo x is 0.5 gallons. That means I need to add 0.5 gallons of orange juice. Looking at the options, option A is 0.5. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check. If I add half a gallon of orange juice to the original one gallon, the total becomes 1.5 gallons. The orange juice is 0.4 + 0.5 = 0.9 gallons. 0.9 divided by 1.5 is 0.6, which is 60%. Yeah, that checks out.\n\nI think that's right. So the correct answer is A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that the initial soft drink mixture contains 40% orange juice and 60% water in a total of 1 gallon. This means there are 0.4 gallons of orange juice and 0.6 gallons of water.\n\nLet \\( x \\) represent the additional gallons of orange juice to be added. After adding \\( x \\) gallons of orange juice, the total volume of the mixture becomes \\( 1 + x \\) gallons. The total amount of orange juice in the mixture becomes \\( 0.4 + x \\) gallons.\n\nWe want the orange juice to make up 60% of the new mixture.

Let me make sure I understand. So currently, the soft drink is 40% OJ and 60% water. So in one gallon, that's 0.4 gallons of OJ and 0.6 gallons of water. Now, they want to add more OJ to increase the percentage of OJ to 60% of the total mixture. So I need to find out how much OJ to add so that OJ becomes 60%.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. When you add more OJ, the amount of OJ increases, but the total volume of the soft drink also increases. So the initial OJ is 0.4 gallons. Let's call the amount of OJ we're adding as x gallons. So the new amount of OJ is 0.4 + x. And the new total volume is 1 + x gallons because we're adding x gallons of OJ.\n\nWait, no. Wait a second. Oh wait, no, the original soft drink is one gallon. So when you add x gallons of OJ, the total becomes 1 + x gallons. Because x is the amount you're adding. So the OJ is 0.4 + x, and the total is 1 + x.\n\nWe want the OJ to be 60% of the total. So set up the equation: (0.4 + x) / (1 + x) = 0.6. Let me write that down:\n\n(0.4 + x) / (1 + x) = 0.6\n\nI can solve for x here. Multiply both sides by (1 + x):\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6 * (1 + x)\n\nExpanding the right side: 0.6 * 1 is 0.6, and 0.6*x is 0.6x.\n\nSo, 0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x\n\nNow, subtract 0.6x from both sides:\n\n0.4 + x - 0.6x = 0.6\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n0.4 + 0.4x = 0.6\n\nSubtract 0.4 from both sides:\n\n0.4x = 0.6 - 0.4 \u2192 0.4x = 0.2\n\nDivide both sides by 0.4:\n\nx = 0.2 / 0.4 \u2192 x = 0.5\n\nSo, x is 0.5 gallons. So you need to add half a gallon of OJ.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 0.5. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Let me plug x=0.5 back into the equation.\n\n(0.4 + 0.5) = 0.9 gallons of OJ.\n\nTotal volume is 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 gallons.\n\n0.9 / 1.5 = 0.6, which is 60%. Yep, that works.\n\nSo the correct answer is A) 0.5.\n",
