      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The question is about a box containing balls numbered from 1 to n. We need to find the value of n given that there are 45 different ways to select two balls without selecting the one with number 3.\n\nHmm, so the problem is about combinations, right? Because when we're selecting balls, the order doesn't matter. So combinations are used here.\n\nWait, the problem says that the number of ways to select two balls without selecting the one with number 3 is 45. So, I think I should first figure out how many total ways there are to select any two balls, and then subtract the cases where the number 3 is selected.\n\nLet me break it down. The total number of ways to choose two balls from n is given by the combination formula C(n, 2). The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n!/(k! (n-k)!)). So for two balls, it's n*(n-1)/2.\n\nBut wait, we don't want any selections that include the ball numbered 3. So, how many ways are there to choose two balls where one of them is 3? Well, if we're including 3, then the other ball can be any of the remaining (n-1) balls. So the number of such combinations is (n-1) choose 1, which is (n-1).\n\nSo the number of valid combinations (without ball 3) is total combinations minus the ones that include 3. So that's C(n, 2) - (n-1) = 45.\n\nLet me write that equation down:\n\nC(n, 2) - (n-1) = 45.\n\nNow, substituting C(n, 2) with n(n-1)/2:\n\nn(n-1)/2 - (n -1) = 45.\n\nHmm, I can factor out (n-1) from both terms. Let's see:\n\n(n-1) [n/2 - 1] = 45.\n\nWait, let me make that clearer. Let's factor (n-1) from both terms.\n\nSo:\n\n(n-1) * [ (n/2) - 1 ] = 45.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute it without factoring. Let's compute it step by step.\n\nn(n-1)/2 - (n-1) = 45.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\nn(n-1) - 2(n-1) = 90.\n\nFactor out (n-1):\n\n(n-1)(n - 2) = 90.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check:\n\nn(n-1) is n\u00b2 -n.\n\n2(n-1) is 2n -2.\n\nSo when subtracted, n\u00b2 -n -2n + 2 = n\u00b2 -3n +2.\n\nSo the equation becomes (n\u00b2 -3n +2) = 90.\n\nWhich simplifies to n\u00b2 -3n +2 -90 =0 => n\u00b2 -3n -88 = 0.\n\nWait, that's a quadratic equation. Let me write it correctly:\n\nn\u00b2 -3n -88 = 0.\n\nWait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check the steps.\n\nWait, original equation after multiplying by 2:\n\nn(n-1) - 2(n-1) = 90.\n\nFactor out (n-1):\n\n(n-1)(n - 2) = 90.\n\nYes, because n(n-1) -2(n-1) = (n-1)(n - 2).\n\nSo (n-1)(n-2) =90.\n\nSo now, I have to solve for n in (n-1)(n-2) =90.\n\nHmm, let's find two consecutive integers (since n-1 and n-2 are consecutive) whose product is 90.\n\nLet me list the factors of 90:\n\n1 & 90 \u2192 difference 89 \u2192 nope.\n\n2 &45 \u2192 difference 43.\n\n3 &30 \u2192 27.\n\n5 &18 \u219213.\n\n6 &15 \u21929.\n\n9 &10 \u2192 difference 1.\n\nAh, wait, 9 and 10. So 9*10=90.\n\nSo n-2=9 and n-1=10.\n\nSo n-2=9 \u2192 n=11.\n\nAlternatively, n-1=10 \u2192n=11.\n\nSo n is 11.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure. Let me plug n=11 back into the original equation.\n\nC(11,2) is 55. The number of ways without 3 is 55 minus (11-1) =55-10=45. Oh, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer is 11, which is option A.\n",
