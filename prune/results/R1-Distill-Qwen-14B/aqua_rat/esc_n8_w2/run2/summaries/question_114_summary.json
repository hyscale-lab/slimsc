      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with rotational motion. But let's try to break it down step by step. The question is about a point on the edge of a fan blade and how far it travels in a certain time. Hmm, I remember that when something moves in a circle, the distance it travels is related to the circumference of the circle and how many times it goes around.\n\nAlright, let's read the question again carefully. The point is on the edge of the fan blade, which is rotating in a plane. The distance from the center is 10 centimeters. So that's the radius, right? So radius r is 10 cm.\n\nThe time given is 30 seconds, and the fan runs at 300 revolutions per minute. Wait, revolutions per minute. I need to convert that to revolutions per second because the time is in seconds. Oh yeah, because when dealing with time, the units need to match.\n\nSo, 300 revolutions per minute. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so to get per second, I divide by 60. Let me calculate that. 300 divided by 60 is 5. So the fan is making 5 revolutions every second. That makes sense.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait a second. Wait, 300 revolutions per minute. So in one minute (60 seconds), it does 300 revs. So per second, that's 300/60 = 5 revs per second. Right, so 5 revs every second.\n\nNow, the time is 30 seconds. So how many total revolutions happen in that time? It's just the rate multiplied by time. So 5 revs/sec * 30 sec = 150 revolutions. Oh, wait, 5 *30 is 150. Yeah, that's right.\n\nEach revolution, the point on the edge travels the circumference of the circle. The circumference is 2 * pi * r. Since r is 10 cm, the circumference is 2 * pi * 10 = 20 pi cm. So each revolution, the point moves 20 pi cm.\n\nSo the total distance traveled would be the number of revolutions multiplied by the circumference. So 150 revs * 20 pi cm/rev. Let me do that multiplication. 150 * 20 is 3000. So 3000 pi cm. Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 3000 pi. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, is the time correct? The time given is 30 seconds, and the rate is per minute. Oh right, I converted it correctly. 300 rev/min is 5 rev/sec. 5 *30 is 150. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it another way. Sometimes when I'm nervous, I make mistakes. Let me try a different approach. Let's calculate the angular speed first.\n\nAngular speed (omega) is usually in radians per second. Since one revolution is 2 pi radians, and the fan is doing 300 rev per minute, that's 300 * 2 pi rad per minute. So 600 pi rad/min. To get per second, divide by 60. So 600 pi /60 = 10 pi radians per second. Wait, that's 10 pi rad/s.\n\nNow, the time is 30 seconds, so the total angle swept is omega * time. So 10 pi * 30 = 300 pi radians.\n\nWait, but the distance traveled is the arc length, which is r * theta. Theta is in radians. So r is 10 cm, theta is 300 pi. So 10 * 300 pi = 3000 pi cm. Same answer as before. So that's consistent.\n\nSo the answer should be 3000 pi cm, which is option D. But wait, looking back at the options: option D is 3000 pi. Yeah, so that's the one.\n\nWait a moment, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The point is on the edge, so radius is 10 cm, so circumference is correct. The time is 30 seconds, which I converted correctly. The rate was per minute, so yes, 300/60 is 5 rev per second. 5 *30 is 150 revs. 150 * 20 pi is 3000 pi. Everything checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I might have messed up the units somewhere, but no, the radius is in cm, so the distance is in cm. The time is in seconds, the rate was converted properly. So yeah, I think D is correct.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about a point on the edge of a fan blade. The fan is rotating, and the point is 10 centimeters from the center. I need to find out how far that point travels after 30 seconds when the fan runs at 300 revolutions per minute. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.\n\nHmm, okay. So I remember that when something is moving in a circular path, the distance it travels depends on the circumference of the circle and how many times it goes around. So each revolution would be the point moving along the circumference once.\n\nFirst, let me note down the given values. The radius (distance from the center) is 10 cm. The time is 30 seconds. The fan speed is 300 revolutions per minute. Wait, but the time is in seconds, and the speed is per minute. I think I need to convert either the time to minutes or the speed to per second. Probably easier to convert the time to minutes because the speed is already given in revolutions per minute.\n\nSo 30 seconds is half a minute, right? Because 30 seconds divided by 60 is 0.5 minutes. So time t is 0.5 minutes.\n\nNext, the fan's speed is 300 revolutions per minute. So in one minute, it does 300 revolutions. But we're only looking at half a minute. So the number of revolutions in 30 seconds would be 300 rev/min * 0.5 min. Let me calculate that: 300 * 0.5 is 150 revolutions. So the point goes around 150 times in 30 seconds.\n\nNow, each revolution is the circumference of the circle the point is moving along. The formula for the circumference is 2 * pi * radius. The radius is 10 cm, so circumference C = 2 * pi * 10 = 20 pi cm.\n\nSo each revolution, the point travels 20 pi centimeters. For 150 revolutions, the total distance would be 150 * 20 pi.\n\nLet me compute that. 150 multiplied by 20 is 3000. So 3000 pi centimeters. Wait, but looking at the options, I see option D is 3000 pi. That's one of the choices.\n\nWait a minute, did I do that right? Let me double-check. Time is 30 seconds. 300 rev per minute. So per second, it's 300/60 = 5 rev per second. So in 30 seconds, 5 * 30 = 150 revolutions. Yep, same as before.\n\nCircumference is 2 pi r, which is 20 pi. So 150 * 20 pi is 3000 pi. So the total distance is 3000 pi cm. Looking at the options, option D is 3000 pi. So the correct answer should be D.\n",
