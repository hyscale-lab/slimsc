      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a survey where students each selected two songs from a list of 10. Each song was selected 5 times. And we need to find out how many students were surveyed.\n\nWait, wait. So each student picks 2 songs. That means for each student, two selections are made. So if there are N students, the total number of song selections is 2*N. Because each student contributes two choices.\n\nNow, each song was selected 5 times. There are 10 songs, right? So each song is picked 5 times. So the total number of selections across all songs is 10 * 5 = 50.\n\nBut wait, wait. Because each selection is a song that a student chose. So the total number of song selections is 50. And since each student makes two selections, the number of students must be total selections divided by 2.\n\nSo 50 divided by 2 is 25. So 25 students? That would make the answer D)25.\n\nWait a second, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Are there any constraints or details I'm overlooking? Like, is there a possibility that some students might have chosen the same songs more than once, or something like that? The question says each student selects 2 songs, but does it allow them to pick the same song twice?\n\nLooking back, the question says each student selected from a list of 10 songs the 2 songs they liked best. So I think it's implied that they pick two distinct songs. Because you wouldn't usually say \"liked best\" if they were the same. So each student contributes two unique song selections.\n\nSo if each song was selected 5 times, that's 10 songs *5 =50 selections. Each student makes 2, so 50/2 =25 students. So the answer should be D)25.\n\nI think that's solid. Let me check the options again. The options are A)96, B)48, C)32, D)25, E)18. Yeah, D is 25, which matches our calculation.\n",

I need to find out how many students were surveyed. The options are A)96, B)48, C)32, D)25, E)18. \n\nWait, so each student chooses exactly two songs. And each song was chosen 5 times in total. Oh, right, so each song is liked by 5 students. There are 10 songs in total. \n\nLet me think about it. So for each song, 5 students picked it. Since there are 10 songs, the total number of song selections is 10 songs multiplied by 5 selections each. That would be 50 selections in total. \n\nBut wait, each student selects two songs.
