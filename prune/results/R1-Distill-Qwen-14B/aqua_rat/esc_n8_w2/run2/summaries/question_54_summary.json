      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where there are 10 oranges in a basket, and I need to find out how many ways I can choose 2 oranges from the basket. Hmm, right, I remember something about combinations from math class. Let me think this through step by step.\n\nWait, combinations are used when the order doesn't matter, right? Like, choosing 2 oranges and it doesn't matter which one is picked first or second. So if I have 10 oranges and I want to pick 2, the formula for combinations should help here. The formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n! divided by (k! times (n - k)! ). Oh right, n is the total number, and k is how many we choose.\n\nSo in this case, n is 10 and k is 2. Plugging those numbers into the formula, it should be 10! divided by (2! times (10-2)! ). Let me calculate that. 10! is 10 factorial, which is 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 1, but wait, maybe I can simplify this without calculating the entire factorials. Because 10! is 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8! and the denominator has (2! \u00d7 8! ). Oh, I see, so the 8! in the numerator and denominator will cancel out. That's smart because it saves computation time.\n\nSo after canceling, it becomes (10 \u00d7 9) divided by (2 \u00d7 1). Because 2! is 2\u00d71. Let me compute that. 10 multiplied by 9 is 90, and 2 multiplied by 1 is 2. So 90 divided by 2 is 45. So the number of ways is 45.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to think about it: for the first orange, I have 10 choices. For the second, since I've already picked one, there are 9 left. So 10 times 9 is 90. But wait, that's considering the order, right? Because picking orange A then B is different from B then A in permutations. But since the question is about combinations where order doesn't matter, I have to divide by 2! to account for the two possible orders of each pair. So 90 divided by 2 is 45. Yep, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo looking at the options, option A is 45. So the correct answer should be A.\n",

I remember something about combinations and permutations. Wait, combinations are used when the order doesn't matter, right?

The formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n!/(k! * (n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number we're choosing.\n\nHere, n is 10 and k is 2.

Let me break it down. 10! is 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8! So the 8! in the numerator and denominator will cancel out. That leaves me with (10 \u00d7 9) / (2 \u00d7 1) because 2! is 2.
