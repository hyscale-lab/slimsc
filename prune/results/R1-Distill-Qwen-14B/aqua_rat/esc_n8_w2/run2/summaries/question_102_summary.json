      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a club where the members' ages form an arithmetic progression. The common difference is 3 months. The youngest member is 7 years old, and the total sum of all their ages is 250. I need to find how many members are in the club. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in an arithmetic progression (AP), each term increases by a common difference. Here, that's 3 months, which is a quarter of a year. So the ages go 7, 7.25, 7.5, and so on.\n\nWait, but working in years might be easier. Let me convert everything into years to avoid dealing with fractions. So, 3 months is 0.25 years. The common difference, d, is 0.25 years.\n\nThe first term, a, is 7 years. The number of terms is n, which I need to find. The sum of the AP is given as 250 years.\n\nThe formula for the sum of an AP is S = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d]. Oh right, that's the one. So I can plug in the values I have into this formula and solve for n.\n\nLet's substitute the known values:\nS = 250 = (n/2) * [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n2*7 is 14. Then (n-1)*0.25 is 0.25n - 0.25. So adding those together, 14 + 0.25n - 0.25 equals 13.75 + 0.25n.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n250 = (n/2) * (13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n500 = n*(13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nExpanding the right side:\n500 = 13.75n + 0.25n\u00b2\n\nLet me rearrange this into a standard quadratic equation form:\n0.25n\u00b2 + 13.75n - 500 = 0\n\nHmm, dealing with decimals can be a bit tricky. Maybe I can multiply all terms by 4 to eliminate the 0.25. Let's see:\n\n4*(0.25n\u00b2) = n\u00b2\n4*(13.75n) = 55n\n4*(-500) = -2000\n\nSo the equation becomes:\nn\u00b2 + 55n - 2000 = 0\n\nNow I have a quadratic equation: n\u00b2 +55n -2000 = 0.\n\nTo solve for n, I can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic is ax\u00b2 +bx +c = 0, so a=1, b=55, c=-2000.\n\nThe quadratic formula is n = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 4ac)]/(2a)\n\nLet's compute the discriminant first: b\u00b2 -4ac\n= (55)^2 -4*1*(-2000)\n= 3025 + 8000\n= 11025\n\nThe square root of 11025: Hmm, I think 105 squared is 11025 because 100\u00b2 is 10000, 105\u00b2 is 11025. Yes, because 105*105 = (100+5)^2 = 10000 + 1000 +25 = 11025.\n\nSo sqrt(11025) = 105.\n\nNow plug into the formula:\nn = [-55 \u00b1 105]/(2*1)\nSo two possible solutions:\nn = (-55 + 105)/2 = 50/2 =25\nn = (-55 -105)/2 = (-160)/2 =-80\n\nBut the number of members can't be negative, so n=25 is the only valid solution.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is 25. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check my calculations. Sometimes when I'm working quickly, I might make a mistake.\n\nLet me verify the sum with n=25.\n\nUsing the sum formula:\nS = (25/2) * [2*7 + (25-1)*0.25]\n= (25/2) * [14 + 24*0.25]\n24*0.25 is 6, so 14+6=20.\n\nSo S = (25/2)*20 = (25)*10 = 250. Which matches the given sum. So yes, n=25 is correct.\n\nSo the number of members is 25. The answer is option C.\n",

The common difference is 3 months. The youngest member is 7 years old, and the sum of all their ages is 250. I need to find the number of members. The options are A)18, B)20, C)25, D)26, E)27.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. So, arithmetic progression. That means each member's age increases by a fixed amount, which here is 3 months. So the ages go like 7, 7.25, 7.5, etc. Wait, no, 3 months is a quarter of a year, so 0.25 years. So each term in the A.P. increases by 0.25 years.\n\nThe sum of the ages is 250. So I'm thinking of using the formula for the sum of an A.P. The formula is S = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d], where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference.\n\nWait, let me make sure. The formula can also be written as S = n*(a1 + an)/2, where a1 is the first term and an is the last term. Because the sum is the average of the first and last term multiplied by the number of terms.\n\nSo, in this case, a1 is 7 years. The last term, an, would be a1 + (n-1)*d. Since d is 3 months, which is 0.25 years. So an = 7 + (n-1)*0.25.\n\nSo the sum S is 250 = n/2 * [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]. Let me plug that in.\n\nWait, let's write that equation out:\n\n250 = (n/2) * [14 + 0.25(n-1)]\n\nHmm, I can simplify that equation to find n. Let's expand it step by step.\n\nFirst, multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n500 = n * [14 + 0.25(n-1)]\n\nExpand the bracket:\n\n500 = n*(14 + 0.25n - 0.25)\n\nSimplify the terms inside:\n\n14 - 0.25 is 13.75, so 500 = n*(13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nSo, 500 = 0.25n\u00b2 + 13.75n\n\nHmm, let's rearrange it into a standard quadratic equation form. Subtract 500 from both sides:\n\n0.25n\u00b2 + 13.75n -500 =0\n\nTo make it easier, maybe multiply every term by 4 to eliminate the decimals. So:\n\n4*0.25n\u00b2 = n\u00b2, 4*13.75n=55n, 4*(-500)= -2000.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nn\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me double-check that multiplication. 4*0.25 is 1, correct. 4*13.75 is 55, because 13.75 *4 is 55. 4*(-500) is -2000, right.\n\nSo the quadratic equation is n\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0.\n\nNow, we can solve for n using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is an^2 + bn + c =0, so a=1, b=55, c=-2000.\n\nThe quadratic formula is n = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nDiscriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac = 55\u00b2 -4*1*(-2000) = 3025 +8000= 11025.\n\nWhat's the square root of 11025? Let me think. 105 squared is 11025 because 100\u00b2=10000, 105\u00b2= (100+5)^2 = 10000 + 1000 +25= 11025. Yes.\n\nSo sqrt(D)=105.\n\nSo n = [ -55 \u00b1 105 ]/(2*1)\n\nWe have two solutions:\n\nn = (-55 +105)/2 = (50)/2=25.\n\nn = (-55 -105)/2= (-160)/2= -80.\n\nBut n can't be negative, so n=25.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 25. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I make mistakes with the signs or the multiplication.\n\nSo the initial equation after multiplying both sides by 2 was 500 = n*(13.75 + 0.25n). Then 500=0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n.\n\nMultiplying by 4: 2000 = n\u00b2 +55n \u2192 n\u00b2+55n -2000=0.\n\nYes, that's correct. Then using quadratic formula, got n=25.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of months to avoid dealing with fractions. Let's try that approach.\n\n7 years is 84 months. The common difference is 3 months. So the ages are 84, 87, 90, ... months.\n\nThe sum of the ages in months would be 250 years. Wait, 250 years is 250*12 = 3000 months. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the sum is 250 years, but each member's age is in years, so perhaps that's not the right approach. Alternatively, maybe I should convert everything into months.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the sum as n/2*(2a + (n-1)d) where a=7 years, d=0.25 years.\n\nSo, 250 = n/2 [14 + 0.25(n-1)].\n\nYes, that's what I did earlier, leading to n=25.\n\nHmm, but the options include 25 as option C, which is one of the choices.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me plug n=25 into the sum formula to see if it gives 250.\n\nSum = 25/2 [2*7 + (25-1)*0.25]\n\n= 12.5 [14 + 24*0.25]\n\n24*0.25 is 6, so 14+6=20.\n\n12.5 *20 = 250. Yep, that checks out.\n\nSo the answer is 25, which is option C.\n",

So the ages go like 7, 7.25, 7.5, etc. Wait, no, 3 months is a quarter of a year, so 0.25 years. So each term in the A.P. increases by 0.25 years.\n\nThe sum of the ages is 250. So I'm thinking of using the formula for the sum of an A.P. The formula is S = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d], where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference.\n\nWait, let me make sure. The formula can also be written as S = n*(a1 + an)/2, where a1 is the first term and an is the last term. Because the sum is the average of the first and last term multiplied by the number of terms.\n\nSo, in this case, a1 is 7 years. The last term, an, would be a1 + (n-1)*d. Since d is 3 months, which is 0.25 years. So an = 7 + (n-1)*0.25.\n\nSo the sum S is 250 = n/2 * [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]. Let me plug that in.\n\nWait, let's write that equation out:\n\n250 = (n/2) * [14 + 0.25(n-1)]\n\nHmm, I can simplify that equation to find n. Let's expand it step by step.\n\nFirst, multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n500 = n * [14 + 0.25(n-1)]\n\nExpand the bracket:\n\n500 = n*(14 + 0.25n - 0.25)\n\nSimplify the terms inside:\n\n14 - 0.25 is 13.75, so 500 = n*(13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nSo, 500 = 0.25n\u00b2 + 13.75n\n\nHmm, let's rearrange it into a standard quadratic equation form. Subtract 500 from both sides:\n\n0.25n\u00b2 + 13.75n -500 =0\n\nTo make it easier, maybe multiply every term by 4 to eliminate the decimals. So:\n\n4*0.25n\u00b2 = n\u00b2, 4*13.75n=55n, 4*(-500)= -2000.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nn\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me double-check that multiplication. 4*0.25 is 1, correct. 4*13.75 is 55, because 13.75 *4 is 55. 4*(-500) is -2000, right.\n\nSo the quadratic equation is n\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0.\n\nNow, we can solve for n using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is an^2 + bn + c =0, so a=1, b=55, c=-2000.\n\nThe quadratic formula is n = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nDiscriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac = 55\u00b2 -4*1*(-2000) = 3025 +8000= 11025.\n\nWhat's the square root of 11025? Let me think. 105 squared is 11025 because 100\u00b2=10000, 105\u00b2= (100+5)^2 = 10000 + 1000 +25= 11025. Yes.\n\nSo sqrt(D)=105.\n\nSo n = [ -55 \u00b1 105 ]/(2*1)\n\nWe have two solutions:\n\nn = (-55 +105)/2 = (50)/2=25.\n\nn = (-55 -105)/2= (-160)/2= -80.\n\nBut n can't be negative, so n=25.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 25. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I make mistakes with the signs or the multiplication.\n\nSo the initial equation after multiplying both sides by 2 was 500 = n*(13.75 + 0.25n). Then 500=0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n.\n\nMultiplying by 4: 2000 = n\u00b2 +55n \u2192 n\u00b2+55n -2000=0.\n\nYes, that's correct. Then using quadratic formula, got n=25.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of months to avoid dealing with fractions. Let's try that approach.\n\n7 years is 84 months. The common difference is 3 months. So the ages are 84, 87, 90, ... months.\n\nThe sum of the ages in months would be 250 years. Wait, 250 years is 250*12 = 3000 months. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the sum is 250 years, but each member's age is in years, so perhaps that's not the right approach. Alternatively, maybe I should convert everything into months.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the sum as n/2*(2a + (n-1)d) where a=7 years, d=0.25 years.\n\nSo, 250 = n/2 [14 + 0.25(n-1)].\n\nYes, that's what I did earlier, leading to n=25.\n\nHmm, but the options include 25 as option C, which is one of the choices.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me plug n=25 into the sum formula to see if it gives 250.\n\nSum = 25/2 [2*7 + (25-1)*0.25]\n\n= 12.5 [14 + 24*0.25]\n\n24*0.25 is 6, so 14+6=20.\n\n12.5 *20 = 250. Yep, that checks out.\n\nSo the answer is 25, which is option C.\n\n\nThe problem involves a club where the ages of the members form an arithmetic progression (A.P.) with a common difference of 3 months (0.25 years). The youngest member is 7 years old, and the sum of all members' ages is 250 years. The goal is to find the number of members, \\( n \\).\n\nThe sum of an A.P. is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{n}{2} \\left[ 2a + (n-1)d \\right]\n\\]\n\nHere:\n- \\( S = 250 \\) (total sum of ages),\n- \\( a = 7 \\) (age of the youngest member),\n- \\( d = 0.25 \\) (common difference in years).\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n250 = \\frac{n}{2} \\left[ 14 + (n-1)(0.25) \\right]\n\\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\\[\n250 = \\frac{n}{2} \\left[ 14 + 0.25(n-1) \\right]\n\\]\n\nMultiply through by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n500 = n \\left[ 14 + 0.25(n-1) \\right]\n\\]\n\nExpand and simplify:\n\n\\[\n500 = n \\left[ 14 + 0.25n - 0.25 \\right]\n\\]\n\n\\[\n500 = n \\left[ 13.75 + 0.25n \\right]\n\\]\n\n\\[\n500 = 0.25n^2 + 13.75n\n\\]\n\nRearrange into standard quadratic form:\n\n\\[\n0.25n^2 + 13.75n - 500 = 0\n\\]\n\nTo eliminate decimals, multiply through by 4:\n\n\\[\nn^2 + 55n - 2000 = 0\n\\]\n\nSolve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 55 \\), and \\( c = -2000 \\). Compute the discriminant:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 55^2 - 4(1)(-2000) = 3025 + 8000 = 11025\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{11025} = 105\n\\]\n\nSubstitute into the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-55 \\pm 105}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis gives two solutions:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-55 + 105}{2} = \\frac{50}{2} = 25, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad n = \\frac{-55 - 105}{2} = \\frac{-160}{2} = -80\n\\]\n\nSince \\( n \\) must be positive, \\( n = 25 \\).\n\nTo verify, substitute \\( n = 25 \\) back into the sum formula:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{25}{2} \\left[ 2(7) + (25-1)(0.25) \\right]\n\\]\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{25}{2} \\left[ 14 + 6 \\right] = \\frac{25}{2} \\times 20 = 250\n\\]\n\nThis confirms that \\( n = 25 \\) is correct. Therefore, the number of members in the club is **25**, corresponding to option C.\n\nAnswer: C",
