      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about simple interest, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again. \n\nRahul borrowed Rs. 500 at 6% per annum simple interest. He needs to pay it back after 4 years. The question is asking what amount he will pay to clear the debt. The options are A)750, B)700, C)620, D)600, E)None of these.\n\nHmm, I remember that simple interest is calculated using the formula I = P * R * T, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest per annum, and T is the time in years. Then the total amount to be paid back is the principal plus the interest, right? So the formula should be A = P + I, which is A = P + (P * R * T). Alternatively, that can be written as A = P(1 + R*T).\n\nWait, let me make sure I got the formula right. Yeah, simple interest doesn't compound, so each year the interest is calculated only on the original principal. So yeah, I think that's correct.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. The principal P is 500. The rate R is 6%, which as a decimal is 0.06. The time T is 4 years.\n\nSo first, calculate the interest. I = 500 * 0.06 * 4. Let me compute that step by step.\n\n500 multiplied by 0.06 is... 500 * 0.06. Well, 1% of 500 is 5, so 6% is 30. So I = 30 * 4. That's 120. So the interest over four years is 120 rupees.\n\nThen the total amount A is P + I, which is 500 + 120 = 620. So Rahul has to pay 620. Looking at the options, option C is 620. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me compute 500 * 0.06 again. 500 * 0.06 is 30. Then 30 * 4 is 120. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the total amount is 500 + 120 = 620. That's option C. So the answer should be C.\n",
