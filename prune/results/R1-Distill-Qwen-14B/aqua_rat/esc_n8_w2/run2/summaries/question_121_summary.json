      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again and try to figure it out step by step. \n\nSo, the problem says that there are 64 boys and 40 girls in a group. Then, during their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. Now, the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3. The question is, how many members are there in the group now?\n\nHmm, right. So, the initial numbers are 64 boys and 40 girls. Let's denote the number of boys and girls that joined as x each. Because the same number of boys and girls joined, so x is the same for both. \n\nSo, after the new members joined, the number of boys becomes 64 + x, and the number of girls becomes 40 + x. \n\nNow, the ratio of boys to girls is given as 4:3. Ratios can be tricky, but I remember that ratios can be set up as fractions. So, (boys)/(girls) = 4/3. \n\nSo, putting that into an equation: (64 + x)/(40 + x) = 4/3. \n\nNow, I need to solve for x. Let's cross-multiply to get rid of the fractions. \n\nSo, 3*(64 + x) = 4*(40 + x). \n\nLet me compute each side. \n\nLeft side: 3*64 is 192, and 3*x is 3x. So, 192 +3x. \n\nRight side: 4*40 is 160, and 4*x is 4x. So, 160 +4x. \n\nNow, the equation is 192 +3x = 160 +4x. \n\nHmm, let's get all the x terms on one side and the constants on the other. Subtract 3x from both sides: 192 = 160 + x. \n\nThen, subtract 160 from both sides: 192 -160 = x. \n\n192 minus 160 is 32. So x=32. \n\nSo, 32 boys and 32 girls joined. \n\nNow, the new numbers are 64+32=96 boys and 40+32=72 girls. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the total number of members now. So, 96 +72=168. \n\nLooking at the options, E is 168. But wait, looking back, the options are A)277, B)288, C)200, D)277, E)168. So E is the correct answer. \n\nWait a second, but I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Let me double-check.\n\nSo, initial boys 64, girls 40. x=32 added to each. Boys become 96, girls 72. Ratio is 96:72. Let's see if that simplifies to 4:3. \n\nDivide both by 24: 96/24=4, 72/24=3. Yep, that's correct. \n\nSo, total members is 96+72=168. So the answer should be E. \n\nWait, but looking at the options again, I see that option D is also 277. Oh, no, wait, the options are A)277, B)288, C)200, D)277, E)168. So D is a duplicate of A. Hmm, but that's probably a typo. But regardless, E is 168, which is correct. \n\nSo I think the answer is E. \n",

Hmm, I need to find the total number of members now.\n\nAlright, the initial group has 64 boys and 40 girls. So, that's 64 + 40 = 104 people originally. Then, during the membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined. Let's call the number of boys and girls that joined 'x'. So, the new number of boys would be 64 + x, and the new number of girls would be 40 + x.\n\nThe problem says that after these additions, the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3. So, the ratio (64 + x)/(40 + x) should be equal to 4/3. I think I can set up an equation here.\n\nLet me write that out: (64 + x)/(40 + x) = 4/3.\n\nNow, I can cross-multiply to solve for x. So, 3*(64 + x) = 4*(40 + x). Let's calculate both sides.\n\nLeft side: 3*64 is 192, plus 3x. So, 192 + 3x.\n\nRight side: 4*40 is 160, plus 4x.

Oh, so x is 32.\n\nSo, 32 boys and 32 girls joined. Let me check the new numbers. Boys: 64 +32=96, Girls:40 +32=72.\n\nNow, the ratio of boys to girls is 96:72. Let me simplify that.
