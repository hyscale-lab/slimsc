      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me see. A cyclist is traveling at 12 miles per hour. The question is asking how many minutes it will take to travel 48 miles. Hmm, I think I remember that time is equal to distance divided by speed. So I should probably use that formula.\n\nWait, the units are in hours and miles, but the answer needs to be in minutes. Oh right, I'll have to convert the time from hours to minutes by multiplying by 60. Because 1 hour is 60 minutes.\n\nSo first, let's calculate the time in hours. The distance is 48 miles, and the speed is 12 mph. So time equals distance over speed. That would be 48 divided by 12. Let me do that division. 48 divided by 12 is 4. Oh, wait, so it's 4 hours.\n\nBut the question is asking for minutes. So I need to convert 4 hours into minutes. Multiply 4 by 60. 4 times 60 is 240. So the time taken is 240 minutes. Let me look at the options.\n\nOptions are A)1, B)240, C)30, D)60, E)120. So B is 240. That must be the correct answer.\n\nWait, did I do everything right? Let me double-check. 12 mph means 12 miles in 60 minutes. So for 48 miles, how many 12s are there in 48? 4. So 4 times 60 is 240. Yeah, that's correct. So the answer is B.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where a cyclist is traveling at 12 miles per hour, and I need to find out how many minutes it will take them to travel 48 miles. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that time is equal to distance divided by speed. So the formula should be time = distance / speed. The distance here is 48 miles, and the speed is 12 mph. So plugging those numbers in, it would be 48 divided by 12. Let me calculate that. 48 divided by 12 is 4. So that gives me 4 hours. But wait, the question asks for the time in minutes, not hours.\n\nOh right, so I need to convert hours into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so I should multiply the number of hours by 60. So 4 hours multiplied by 60 minutes per hour equals 240 minutes. Hmm, looking at the options, option B is 240. That seems right.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check. 12 mph means the cyclist covers 12 miles every 60 minutes. So how many sets of 12 miles are in 48 miles? Let me divide 48 by 12. That's 4. So each set takes 60 minutes, so 4 times 60 is 240 minutes. Yep, that's consistent with what I found earlier.\n\nAnother way to think about it: if the speed is 12 miles per hour, then in one hour, the cyclist goes 12 miles. To go 48 miles, how many hours? 4 hours. Convert to minutes: 4 * 60 = 240. So definitely, the answer should be 240 minutes. Looking at the options, option B is 240. So I'm confident that's the correct choice.\n",
