      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about two ants and their shadows. Hmm, I think it's a proportion problem. Let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nSo, the first ant is 4 inches tall and casts a shadow that's 10 inches long. The second ant is taller, 6 inches, and we need to find out how long its shadow is. I remember that when dealing with similar objects, like two ants, the ratio of their heights should be the same as the ratio of their shadows. Oh right, similar triangles or something like that.\n\nWait, so the sun's rays are coming at the same angle for both ants, right? That means the triangles formed by the ants and their shadows are similar. So the proportion should hold. Let me write that down.\n\nThe first ant's height to shadow length is 4 inches to 10 inches. The second ant's height is 6 inches, and we're looking for the shadow length, let's call it S.\n\nSo the proportion would be 4/10 = 6/S. Or wait, is it 4/6 = 10/S? No, wait, I think it's the same ratio for height to shadow. So the first ant's height over shadow equals the second's height over shadow. So 4/10 = 6/S. Let me double-check that. Because if the ant is taller, the shadow should be longer, so if 4 gives 10, then 6 should give a longer shadow than 10. So the equation should have S bigger than 10.\n\nWait, but if I set up 4/10 = 6/S, then cross-multiplying gives 4S = 60, so S would be 15. But that would mean the shadow is 15 inches, which is longer than 10. That makes sense because the ant is taller. But wait, I'm looking at the options. Let's see, the options are A)36, B)28, C)42, D)15, E)20.\n\nWait, option D is 15. But that seems a bit short compared to the other options. Did I get the ratio backwards?\n\nWait another thought: Maybe it's the shadow length over height that's the same. So shadow/height is the same for both. So for the first ant, 10/4, which is 2.5. So for the second ant, shadow S would be 2.5 times 6. 2.5 *6 is 15. So S is 15. Oh, so that's the same as before. So the answer would be D)15.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because 15 is an option, but I thought maybe I messed up the ratio. Let me think again. Alternatively, if the setup was 4 inches tall casts 10-inch shadow, and the second is 6 inches, then the ratio of heights is 6/4, which is 1.5. So the shadow should be 1.5 times longer than the first shadow. So 10 * 1.5 is 15. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be 15, which is option D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves determining the length of the shadow cast by a taller ant, given the height and shadow length of a shorter ant. The key principle is that the ratio of the height to the shadow length for both ants remains constant because the sun's rays create similar triangles.\n\nFor the first ant, the height is 4 inches, and the shadow length is 10 inches. For the second ant, the height is 6 inches, and the shadow length is unknown, denoted as \\( S \\). Using the proportion:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Height of first ant}}{\\text{Shadow length of first ant}} = \\frac{\\text{Height of second ant}}{\\text{Shadow length of second ant}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{6}{S}\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\n\\[\n4S = 60 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad S = 15\n\\]\n\nThus, the shadow length of the taller ant is 15 inches. This matches option D. The other options (A, B, C, and E) are incorrect because they do not align with the proportional relationship between height and shadow length.\n\nAnswer: D",

The second ant is taller, 6 inches. I need to find its shadow length. So I guess I can set up a ratio here. The height of the first ant to its shadow length should be the same as the second ant's height to its shadow length.\n\nLet me write that out. So, 4 inches / 10 inches = 6 inches / x inches, where x is the shadow length I'm trying to find. Alternatively, it could be set up as 4/6 = 10/x. Wait, wait, no, I think I mixed that up. Let me think again.\n\nOh right, because the ratio of height to shadow length is the same for both ants. So, for the first ant, it's 4/10. For the second, it's 6/x. So 4/10 = 6/x. Wait, no, actually, wait. No, wait, I think I got that backwards. Because if the first ant is shorter, its shadow is longer. Wait, no, 4 inches tall and 10-inch shadow. So that's a ratio of 4:10. The second ant is taller, so its shadow should be longer than 10 inches? Or shorter? Wait, no, because if the sun is at the same angle, a taller object would cast a longer shadow. So the second ant is taller, so the shadow should be longer than 10 inches. So let me make sure I set up the ratio correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is height over shadow length. So for the first ant, that's 4/10. For the second, 6/x. So 4/10 = 6/x. Then solving for x, cross multiply: 4x = 6*10. So 4x=60, so x=15. Hmm, so the shadow is 15 inches. But wait, looking at the options, D is 15. But wait, that can't be right because the first ant's shadow was 10 inches and it's shorter. So a taller ant would have a longer shadow, right? Oh wait, wait, 15 is longer than 10. So that makes sense. So the shadow is 15 inches. So the answer would be D.\n\nWait, but I thought maybe I should check another way. Let me think in terms of similar triangles. The height of the ant is like the object height, and the shadow is the base of the triangle formed by the sun's rays. So the triangles are similar, so the ratios should be equal.\n\nSo (ant height) / (shadow length) = same for both. So 4/10 = 6/x. So yeah, solving for x gives 15. So the answer is D)15.\n\nWait a second, but looking back at the options, E is 20. Did I make a mistake? Let me double-check my math. 4/10 equals 6/x. Cross multiply: 4x = 60. So x=15. Yep, that's correct. So the answer should be D, 15.\n",
