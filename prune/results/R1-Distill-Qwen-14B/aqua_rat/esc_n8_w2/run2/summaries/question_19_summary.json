      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about exam scores and averages. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So, the question is asking for the average score of the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers. \n\nAlright, let's see what information I'm given. The average of the highest and lowest scores is x. So, if I denote the highest score as H and the lowest as L, then (H + L)/2 = x. That means H + L = 2x. Got that part.\n\nThe overall average for the entire class is y. And there are z students in the class, with z being greater than 5. So, the total sum of all the students' scores is z times y, right? Because average is total sum divided by the number of elements. So, total sum = z * y.\n\nThe question is asking for the average when we exclude the highest and lowest. So, we're considering z - 2 students now, since we're excluding two people. The total sum for these students would be the overall total sum minus H and minus L. Because H and L are the ones we're excluding.\n\nWait, so the sum of the remaining students' scores is (z * y) - H - L. But earlier, I found that H + L = 2x, so substituting that in, the sum becomes (zy) - 2x.\n\nNow, to find the average for these z-2 students, I take that sum and divide by (z-2). So the average is (zy - 2x)/(z - 2). \n\nLet me double-check my reasoning. The total sum is zy, subtract the highest and lowest, which sum to 2x, giving zy-2x. Then, divide by (z-2) because we're excluding two students. That makes sense.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is (zy \u2013 2x)/(z -2). So that should be the correct answer. Let me make sure none of the other options fit. \n\nOption A is (zy \u2013 2x)/z. That would be if we didn't exclude the two students, which isn't the case. Option B is (zy \u2013 2)/z. Hmm, where does the 2 come from? It seems like maybe they subtracted 2, but that doesn't align with the problem. \n\nOption C is (zx \u2013 y)/(z \u2013 2). That doesn't seem to fit because zx would be a different term. Our numerator is zy - 2x. Option E is (zy \u2013 x)/(z +2), which also doesn't fit because the denominator is z+2 and we're excluding two, so denominator should be z-2.\n\nSo yeah, the right answer should be option D.\n",

That means we're considering (z - 2) students. Let me denote the sum of their scores as Sum_middle. So, the average we're looking for is Sum_middle / (z - 2).\n\nBut how do I find Sum_middle? Well, I know that Sum_total is the sum of all students, which includes H and L. So, Sum_middle = Sum_total - H - L. Substituting, Sum_middle = z*y - (H + L). But from earlier, H + L is 2x. So, Sum_middle = zy - 2x.\n\nTherefore, the average for the middle group is (zy - 2x) divided by (z-2).

Let me double-check.\n\nWait, let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, H + L = 2x. Total sum is zy.

Option E has zy -x, which doesn't consider that both H and L are subtracted.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that option D is the correct one.\n",
