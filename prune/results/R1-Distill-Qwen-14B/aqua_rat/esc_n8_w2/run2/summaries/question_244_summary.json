      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's see. The question says, if m is greater than 0, y is greater than 0, and x is m percent of 4y, then in terms of y, m is what percentage of x. Hmm. I think I need to express m as a percentage of x, so like (m/x)*100% maybe?\n\nWait, let me break it down step by step. First, the problem states that x is m percent of 4y. So, I can write that mathematically. If x is m% of 4y, that means x equals (m/100) multiplied by 4y. So, x = (m * 4y)/100. Oh right, because percentages are per hundred.\n\nSo, x = (4m y) / 100. Let me write that as x = (4 m y)/100. That's equation one.\n\nNow, the question is asking, what percentage is m of x? So, in other words, m is what percent of x. To find that, I think the formula would be (m / x) * 100%. So, I need to express this in terms of y.\n\nBut wait, from equation one, I can express m in terms of x and y. Let me rearrange that equation. Let's solve for m. Starting from x = (4 m y)/100. Multiply both sides by 100: 100x = 4 m y. Then, divide both sides by 4y: m = (100x)/(4y). Simplify that, 100 divided by 4 is 25, so m = (25 x)/y.\n\nSo, m is equal to (25 x)/y. Now, I need to find m as a percentage of x. So, (m/x)*100%.\n\nSubstituting m from above: [ (25 x / y) / x ] * 100%. Oh, the x's cancel out. So that's (25 / y) * 100%.\n\nWait, 25 times 100 is 2500, so that's 2500/y percent. So, m is 2500/y percent of x.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 2500/y. So that must be the answer. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't mix up m and x. The problem asks, m is what percentage of x. So yes, it's m over x times 100. So my steps should be correct. x is m% of 4y, so x = (m *4y)/100. Solving for m gives m = (100 x)/(4y) =25x/y. Then m is (m/x)*100% = (25x/y)/x *100% =25/y *100% =2500/y%.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the answer should be D.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question says: If m is greater than 0, y is greater than 0, and x is m percent of 4y. Then, in terms of y, m is what percentage of x? The options are given as A to E.\n\nHmm, okay. Let's break it down. So, I know that percentages can sometimes be tricky, but I think if I take it step by step, it'll make sense.\n\nFirst, the problem states that x is m percent of 4y. I remember that \"A is B percent of C\" translates to A = (B/100)*C. So, applying that here, x should be equal to (m/100) multiplied by 4y. Let me write that down.\n\nSo, x = (m/100) * 4y. Simplifying that, it's x = (4m y)/100. I can write that as x = (4 m y) / 100, or maybe x = (m y * 4) / 100.\n\nWait, maybe I can simplify that further. 4/100 is 0.04, so x = 0.04 * m * y. But I'm not sure if that's helpful yet.\n\nThe question is asking, in terms of y, what percentage is m of x. So, I think I need to find (m is what percentage of x), which mathematically is (m / x) * 100%. Because when you want to find what percentage A is of B, it's (A/B)*100%.\n\nSo, I need to compute (m / x) * 100%. But I already have x in terms of m and y, so I can substitute that in.\n\nSubstituting x from earlier: x = (4 m y)/100.\n\nSo, m divided by x is m divided by (4 m y / 100). Let me write that out:\n\n(m) / [(4 m y) / 100] = (m * 100) / (4 m y) )\n\nHmm, let's simplify that. The m in the numerator and denominator will cancel out, right? So, m cancels, leaving 100/(4y). 100 divided by 4 is 25. So, it's 25 / y.\n\nWait, so that would be 25/y. But wait, that's without the percentage part yet. Because the question is (m/x)*100%, so that 25/y is the result of m/x. So, (25/y) * 100%?\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me double-check. Because when I compute (m / x) * 100, I have:\n\n(m) / x * 100 = [m / (4 m y / 100)] * 100\n\nWhich is [ (m * 100) / (4 m y) ) ] * 100. Wait, no, no, wait. Let me correct this.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me go back.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-express x as (m/100)*4y. So, x = (m *4 y)/100.\n\nSo, m/x is m divided by ( (4 m y)/100 ). So, m divided by that is m * (100)/(4 m y).\n\nThe m terms cancel out, so it's 100/(4 y). Which is 25/(y).\n\nBut wait, no. Because 100 divided by 4 is 25, so yes, it's 25/(y). But that's just m/x. The question is what percentage m is of x, so I have to multiply by 100%.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me clarify. The formula for percentage is (A/B)*100. So, m is A, x is B. So, (m/x)*100%.\n\nSo, (m/x) is [ m ] / [ (4 m y)/100 ] = m * 100/(4 m y) = (100/(4 y)) * (m/m) = 100/(4y) = 25/y.\n\nThen, multiply by 100%? No, wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Because (m/x) is already 25/y, and to get the percentage, I don't multiply by another 100. Because when I write x = (m/100)*4y, I already have x in terms of m and y.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try again.\n\nI think I should compute (m / x) * 100%.\n\nx is (4 m y)/100. So, x = (4 m y)/100.\n\nSo, m / x = m / [(4 m y)/100] = m * [100/(4 m y)] = (100/(4 y)) * (m/m) )= 100/(4 y) ) = 25/y.\n\nSo, (m / x) is 25/y, and to get the percentage, I multiply by 100%? Wait, no, because (m / x) is already (m/x), so to get the percentage, I have to multiply by 100%. So, 25/y * 100% = 2500% / y.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is 2500/y, which would be 2500 divided by y. So that's 2500/y. Hmm.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Because when I compute m/x, that's 25/y. So, m is (25/y) times x, which is 25/y. To get the percentage, I multiply by 100%, so (25/y)*100% = 2500% / y. So, that's 2500 divided by y percent.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the options. Option D is 2500/y. So, if I'm getting 2500/y, that's the value. So, the percentage would be 2500/y percent. Wait, but the question is phrased as \"m is what percentage of x\". So, the answer would be 2500/y percent. But the options are written as, for example, option D is 2500/y, so that would be 2500 divided by y, which is 2500/y. So, the value is 2500/y, which is the percentage.\n\nWait, but let me check again, because I think I might have made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, let's take an example to see if this makes sense.\n\nSuppose m is 100 and y is 4. Then x is m percent of 4y. So, 4y is 4*4=16. x is 100% of 16, which is 16.\n\nSo, m is 100. x is 16. So, m is what percentage of x? (100 / 16) * 100% = 625%.\n\nNow, using the options, let's see what each option gives when y=4.\n\nOption D: 2500/y = 2500/4 = 625. So, that's exactly what we get. So, that makes sense. So, the correct answer would be option D.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nSo, x = (m/100) * 4y = (4 m y)/100.\n\nThen, m is what percentage of x? So, (m / x) * 100% = [ m / ( (4 m y)/100 ) ] * 100.\n\nSimplify the denominator: 4 m y /100.\n\nSo, m divided by (4 m y /100) is (m * 100) / (4 m y) ) = 100/(4 y) = 25/y.\n\nThen, multiply by 100%: 25/y * 100% = 2500% / y. So, 2500/y percent.\n\nWait, but in the options, option D is written as 2500/y, which is 2500 divided by y. So, that's the percentage. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the answer must be option D: 2500/y.\n",

The problem states that \\( x \\) is \\( m \\)% of \\( 4y \\). Using the formula for percentages, \\( x = \\frac{m}{100} \\cdot 4y \\), which simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4my}{100}.\n\\]\n\nNext, the question asks for \\( m \\) as a percentage of \\( x \\). Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{m}{x} \\right) \\cdot 100\\%.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( x = \\frac{4my}{100} \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{m}{x} = \\frac{m}{\\frac{4my}{100}} = \\frac{m \\cdot 100}{4my}.\n\\]\n\nThe \\( m \\) terms cancel out, leaving:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{m}{x} = \\frac{100}{4y} = \\frac{25}{y}.\n\\]\n\nTo find the percentage, multiply by 100%:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\frac{25}{y} \\cdot 100\\% = \\frac{2500}{y}\\%.\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( m \\) is \\( \\frac{2500}{y} \\% \\) of \\( x \\). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:\n\n**D) \\( \\frac{2500}{y} \\)**.\n\nAnswer: D",
