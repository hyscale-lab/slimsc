      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about two cars and their speeds. Let me see if I can figure it out. Hmm, the question is asking for the difference in speed between car X and car Y. I remember that speed is calculated by dividing distance by time. Right, so speed equals distance divided by time.\n\nSo, let's start with car X. It says car X covers 320 kilometers in 8 hours. To find its speed, I'll take the distance, which is 320, and divide it by the time, 8. Let me do that math: 320 divided by 8. Hmm, 8 times 40 is 320, so 320/8 is 40. So car X's speed is 40 km/h.\n\nNext, car Y. It covers 415 kilometers in 5 hours. Using the same formula, speed is distance over time. So 415 divided by 5. Let me calculate that. 5 times 83 is 415 because 5 times 80 is 400, and 5 times 3 is 15. So 80+3 is 83. So car Y's speed is 83 km/h.\n\nNow, I need to find the difference in their speeds. That means subtracting the smaller speed from the larger one. Car Y is faster, so 83 minus 40. 83 minus 40 is 43. So the difference is 43 km/h.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations. For car X: 320 /8 is 40. Correct. Car Y: 415 /5 is 83. Correct. 83 -40 is 43. So the difference is 43 km/h.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 43 km/hr. So the answer should be C.\n",

Alright, I remember that speed is calculated by distance divided by time. So I need to find the speed of each car first, then subtract them to find the difference.\n\nLet's start with Car X. It covers 320 kilometers in 8 hours. So the speed should be 320 divided by 8. Let me do that calculation. 320 divided by 8 is... 40. So Car X's speed is 40 km/hr.\n\nNext up is Car Y. It goes 415 km in 5 hours. So speed is 415 divided by 5. Let me calculate that. 5 goes into 415... 5*80 is 400, so 83 times? Wait, 5 times 83 is 415. So Car Y's speed is 83 km/hr.\n\nNow, to find the difference in their speeds. I subtract the slower speed from the faster one. So 83 minus 40 equals 43. So the difference is 43 km/hr.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 43. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For Car X: 320/8 is definitely 40. For Car Y: 415 divided by 5 is 83 because 5*80 is 400, plus 3*5 is 15, so yes, 83. The difference is 83-40=43. Yep, that's correct. So the answer is C.\n",
