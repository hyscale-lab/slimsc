      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I've got this problem here about a newspaper cost and a hotel ordering them. Hmm. So I need to find out how many newspapers the hotel buys on Monday. \n\nAlright, let me break this down. The newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days. The hotel orders twice as many on Sunday as on the other days. And the total they pay per week is $210. \n\nWait, so the days of the week are seven, right? But Sunday is one day, and the rest are Monday to Saturday, which are six days. But wait, no, wait. No, the rest of the days would be Monday to Saturday, which is six days, right? Or is it the other way around? No, the problem says the hotel orders twice as many on Sunday as the rest of the days. So, for each of the other days, they order a certain number, and on Sunday, it's double that. \n\nWait, no, maybe not. Let me think. Oh, perhaps the hotel orders twice as many on Sunday compared to the total of the other days. Or maybe it's twice as many on Sunday as each of the other days. Hmm, the wording is a bit tricky. Let me read it again. \"Twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" Oh, wait, does that mean Sunday's order is twice the number of each of the other days, or twice the total of the other days?\n\nWait, no, the wording says \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. Wait, let me think. Maybe it's twice as many as the rest, meaning Sunday is twice the sum of all the other days. Or is it that each day other than Sunday is, say, x, and Sunday is 2x?\n\nWait, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the hotel buys twice as many on Sunday as on any other day. So, if on a weekday (Monday to Saturday) they buy x newspapers each day, then on Sunday they buy 2x. But wait, wait, the rest of the days\u2014so maybe the total for the other six days is equal to x, and Sunday is 2x? No, that doesn't make sense because the rest of the days are six days, each possibly with their own counts.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the hotel buys twice as many on Sunday as it does on each of the other days. So for each of Monday to Saturday, it's x, and Sunday is 2x. But that would mean each of the other days is x, and Sunday is 2x. Then, the total for the week would be 6x (from Mon-Sat) + 2x (Sunday) = 8x. But wait, no, wait, wait. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"the rest of the days of the week\" refers to all days except Sunday. So if on each of the other days, the hotel buys x newspapers, then on Sunday, it buys 2x. But that would mean for each day, the number is x, and Sunday is 2x. So the total for the week would be 6x (Mon-Sat) + 2x (Sun) = 8x. \n\nWait, but the total cost is $210 per week. Let me model this. Each newspaper on Sunday costs $4, others $1. So the cost calculation would be: on Sunday, the cost is 2x * $4. On the other days, each day is x * $1, and there are six such days, so 6x * $1. So total cost is (2x *4) + (6x *1) = 8x +6x=14x. And this equals $210. So 14x=210 \u2192 x=15. \n\nSo x is 15. That would mean on each of the other days (Monday to Saturday), the hotel buys 15 newspapers. So the answer would be 15, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I interpreted the problem correctly. The problem says the hotel orders twice as many on Sunday as it does the rest of the days. Hmm, does that mean that the number on Sunday is twice the number for each of the other days, or twice the total of the other days?\n\nWait, if the hotel buys twice as many on Sunday as it does on the rest of the days, that could be interpreted in two ways. One way is that Sunday's order is twice the sum of the other days. Another way is that Sunday's order is twice the number per day for each of the other days.\n\nWait, let's re-express the problem statement. \"the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" So \"rest of the days\" is plural\u2014so perhaps the hotel orders twice as much on Sunday as it does on each of the other days. So if each other day is x, then Sunday is 2x. But wait, that's the same as I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if the rest of the days (Mon-Sat) in total equal x, then Sunday would be 2x. So the total for the week would be x (Mon-Sat) + 2x (Sun) =3x. Then, the cost would be: Mon-Sat: x newspapers at $1 each \u2192 cost is x *1 =x. Sunday: 2x newspapers at $4 \u2192 cost is 2x *4=8x. So total cost is x +8x=9x=210 \u2192x=23.333. But that's not an integer, and the options are all integers. So that can't be right. So perhaps the first interpretation is correct.\n\nSo in that case, each of the other days is x, Sunday is 2x. So total cost: (6x *1) + (2x *4) =6x +8x=14x=210 \u2192x=15. So Monday's order is x=15, which is option A.\n",

So the answer is A)15.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let's denote the number of newspapers the hotel buys on each non-Sunday day (Monday to Saturday) as \\( x \\). According to the problem, the hotel buys twice as many newspapers on Sunday as it does on the other days. Therefore, on Sunday, the hotel buys \\( 2x \\) newspapers.\n\nThe total number of newspapers bought per week is:\n\\[\n6x \\, (\\text{Monday to Saturday}) + 2x \\, (\\text{Sunday}) = 8x.\n\\]\n\nThe cost of newspapers is $4 per paper on Sunday and $1 per paper on other days. Thus, the total weekly cost is:\n\\[\n6x \\cdot 1 + 2x \\cdot 4 = 6x + 8x = 14x.\n\\]\n\nThe problem states that the total weekly cost is $210. Therefore:\n\\[\n14x = 210 \\implies x = \\frac{210}{14} = 15.\n\\]\n\nThis means the hotel buys \\( x = 15 \\) newspapers on each non-Sunday day, including Monday. Thus, the number of newspapers bought on Monday is **15**.\n\nAnswer: A",
