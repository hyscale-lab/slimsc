      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a man rowing a boat. Hmm, let me see. The question says he rows at 4 kmph in still water. Wait, that's his speed without any current, right? So when there's no current, his speed is 4 km/h. But then it says his rate against the current is 2 kmph. I need to find his rate along the current.\n\nWait, I remember that when you're going against the current, your effective speed decreases, and when you're going with it, your speed increases. So, the current's speed must be affecting his overall speed.\n\nLet me think about the variables here. Let's denote the man's rowing speed in still water as 'b' which is 4 kmph. The speed of the current is 'c'. So when he's going upstream (against the current), his effective speed is (b - c). And when he's going downstream (along the current), it's (b + c).\n\nThe problem states that his rate against the current is 2 kmph. So, that's (b - c) = 2. Since b is 4, I can plug that in: 4 - c = 2. Oh, wait, that would make c equal to 2, because 4 minus 2 is 2.\n\nSo the speed of the current is 2 kmph. Now, I need to find his downstream speed, which is (b + c). That would be 4 + 2 = 6 kmph. So the answer should be 6 kmph.\n\nLooking at the options, B and E are both 6. Wait, that's strange. Oh, maybe it's a typo. But regardless, the correct answer is 6. So either option B or E is correct. But since the options list E as 6 again, perhaps it's a mistake in the options.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a man rowing in still water and against the current. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with currents, the effective speed changes based on whether you're going with the current or against it. Let me try to think through this.\n\nThe man's rowing speed in still water is given as 4 km/h. So that's his speed without any current affecting him. When he's rowing against the current, his effective speed is slower. The problem says his rate against the current is 2 km/h. Wait, so when he's going upstream, his speed is 2 km/h.\n\nI think I need to find the speed of the current first. Because the man's rowing speed is 4 km/h in still water, and when he goes against the current, his effective speed is 4 minus the current's speed. Oh right! Because the current is against him, it subtracts from his rowing speed.\n\nSo let me write that down. Let the speed of the current be 'c' km/h. Then, his effective speed against the current is (4 - c) km/h. And we know that's equal to 2 km/h. So:\n\n4 - c = 2\n\nSolving for c, I subtract 4 from both sides. Wait no, wait. Wait, 4 - c = 2 \u2192 subtract 4 from both sides? No, that would be 4 - c = 2 \u2192 c = 4 - 2 \u2192 c = 2 km/h. Oh wait, no, that's not right. Wait, if 4 - c = 2, then c must be 2, because 4 - 2 is 2. So current speed is 2 km/h. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the man's rate along the current, which is downstream. So his effective speed when going with the current would be his rowing speed plus the current's speed. So that's 4 + c.\n\nSince c is 2, then 4 + 2 = 6 km/h. So his downstream speed is 6 km/h.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 6 km/h. Wait, but I see option E is also 6 kmph. Wait, looking again: the options are A)15, B)6, C)12, D)14, E)6. Oh, so both B and E are same. But in the options, maybe it's a typo, perhaps E is another number, but in the problem as given, options B and E are same. Hmm, but the answer should be 6 km/h, so both B and E are correct. But that can't be possible in a multiple-choice question. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check my calculations again. Man's speed in still water is 4. Against current is 2. So 4 - c = 2 \u2192 c = 2. Then downstream speed is 4 + 2 =6. So the answer is 6, which is option B or E. Wait, but the options as presented have both B and E as 6. That seems odd. Perhaps it's a typo and one of them is different. But assuming the options are correct as given, then the correct answer would be 6, and the options are either B or E. But in the given options, perhaps option B is 6 and E is another number. Wait, let me read the question again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)15 kmph\n\nB)6 kmph\n\nC)12 kmph\n\nD)14 kmph\n\nE)6 kmph\n\nSo both B and E are 6. That can't be right. Maybe a typo, but perhaps I miscalculated. Wait, another approach: maybe I misread the problem. Let me read again.\n\nThe man's rowing rate is 4 kmph in still water. His rate against the current is 2 kmph. So against the current, his speed is 2. So man's speed upstream is 2. So current is 4-2=2. So downstream would be 4+2=6. So the correct answer is 6, which is either B or E.\n\nBut since both B and E are same, perhaps the correct choice is B. But wait, in the options, E is also 6. So I'm confused. Maybe the intended answer is B.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the problem has a different setup. Wait, another way: maybe the man's rowing speed is 4 km/h, and when going against the current, his speed is 2 km/h. So the current's speed is 4 - 2 = 2. Then, when going along, his speed is 4 + 2 = 6. So the answer is 6. So the options B and E are same, but perhaps in the actual question, E is another option. Or maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me think again. The man's rowing speed is 4 km/h in still water. So when he rows upstream, his effective speed is (4 - c), which is given as 2. So 4 - c = 2 \u2192 c=2. Then downstream speed is 4 + c = 6. So that's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be 6, which is options B and E. But in the options, perhaps the last option E is 6. So the correct answer would be E. But I'm seeing that both B and E are same, which is not possible in a real test scenario. So perhaps the problem has a typo, but based on the given options, the correct answer is 6.\n\nWait, maybe I should look again at the problem statement. The question says, \"the man's rate along the current is...\" So yes, that's downstream, which is 4 + c. So 6 km/h.\n\nLooking at the options, both B and E are 6. So perhaps the correct choice is B. Alternatively, maybe the options are listed incorrectly, but in any case, the correct answer is 6, so the options B and E are same, but I think the intended answer is option B.\n",
