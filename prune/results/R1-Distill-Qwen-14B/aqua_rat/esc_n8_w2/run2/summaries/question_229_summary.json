      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this math problem. The question is about a positive integer Q that has exactly 5 factors. I need to determine which of the statements I, II, or III must be true about Q. The options are A to E, each combining different statements.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Let me think about how that works. Oh right, if a number Q can be expressed as a product of primes raised to their respective exponents, like Q = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pn^an, then the total number of factors is (a1 + 1)*(a2 + 1)*...*(an + 1). \n\nSo in this problem, Q has exactly 5 factors. 5 is a prime number, so the product of (each exponent plus one) must be 5. Since 5 is prime, the only way to write it as a product is 5 = 5 * 1. That means that Q's prime factorization must have only one term where the exponent is 4, because 4 + 1 = 5. All other exponents must be zero, meaning Q is just a single prime raised to the 4th power, right?\n\nWait, let me clarify. Suppose Q is the square of a prime, so Q = p^2. Then the number of factors is 2 + 1 = 3, which is not 5. That doesn't fit. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. If that's the case, Q would have 3 factors, not 5. So statement I is not correct.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, the number of factors is (exponent + 1) for each prime. If Q is p^4, then the number of factors is 4 + 1 = 5. So that's correct. So statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime. That would give exactly 5 factors. So statement II is true.\n\nWhat about statement III? III says Q is the product of two primes. Let me think: if Q is the product of two different primes, like p * q, then the number of factors would be (1+1)*(1+1) = 4, which is 2*2=4. But we need 5 factors, so that can't be the case. So statement III is not true.\n\nWait, but what if the two primes are the same? Like p^1 * p^1 = p^2. But that's the same as p squared. Then the number of factors would be 2 + 1 = 3, which again isn't 5. So no, statement III isn't correct either.\n\nWait, but another thought: could Q be a cube of a prime? Let's see: if Q = p^3, then factors are 3+1=4, which is less than 5. Not enough.\n\nSo, the only way to get exactly 5 factors is if Q is the fourth power of a single prime. So statement II is correct, and statement I is incorrect because that would give 3 factors. Statement III is incorrect because that would give either 4 or 3 factors, depending on whether the primes are same or different.\n\nWait, but wait, the initial thought was that if the number of factors is 5, which is prime, then the exponents plus one multiplied together must equal 5. So the exponents plus one can only be 5 and 1. So there's only one prime in the factorization, raised to the 4th power. So II is correct.\n\nSo looking back at the statements:\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime: no, that would give 3 factors.\n\nII. Q is the fourth power of a prime: yes.\n\nIII. Q is the product of two primes: no, that gives 4 or 3 factors.\n\nSo which statements are true? Only II. Let me check the options.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA) I only\n\nB) III only\n\nC) II only\n\nD) I and II only\n\nE) I and III only\n\nSo the correct answer is option C, II only. So the answer is C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here about factors, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question is: If Q, a positive integer, has 5 factors, which of the following must be true about Q? There are three statements: I, II, III. The options are combinations of these.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has relates to its prime factorization. Oh right! The formula for the number of factors. I think it's something like if a number N can be expressed as the product of primes raised to their exponents, like N = p1^a * p2^b * p3^c... then the number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc. So for each exponent, you add one and multiply them all together.\n\nSo, in this case, Q has 5 factors. Since 5 is a prime number, the product of (a+1)(b+1)... must equal 5. Now, 5 can only be broken down into factors as 5*1, right? Because 5 is prime. So that means that there's only one term in the product. So that would imply that Q must be of the form p^4, where p is a prime number. Because (4 + 1) =5. Alternatively, could it be another combination? Let me think. If there were two primes, say p and q, then the exponents would have to satisfy (a+1)(b+1) =5. But 5 is prime, so one of the terms would have to be 1 and the other 5. So for example, a=4 and b=0. But wait, if b is 0, then the second prime isn't actually present. So that brings us back to the same scenario as before: the number must be a single prime raised to the 4th power.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. If Q is p^4, then its factors are 1, p, p\u00b2, p\u00b3, p\u2074. That's five factors. So that fits. Alternatively, if Q were p\u00b2 * q, then the number of factors would be (2+1)(1+1)=3*2=6, which is more than 5. So that's not the case. So the only way for the number of factors to be 5 is if the number is the fourth power of a single prime.\n\nWait, but the options have I, which says Q is the square of a prime. Oh! So I thought it's p^4, but I is p squared. So is statement I true? Let me think. If Q is p squared, then the number of factors would be 3 (1, p, p\u00b2). So that's only 3 factors. But the question says Q has 5 factors. So statement I would not be correct. So that would make statement I false.\n\nWait, but wait, no. I'm getting mixed up. Let me recheck. If Q is p^4, then the number of factors is 5, which is correct. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So p squared would give us 3 factors, not 5. So statement I is not true. Then, statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime. That would be correct because (4+1)=5 factors. So statement II is true.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me make sure. What if Q is the product of two primes? Statement III says that. If Q is p * q, then the number of factors is (1+1)(1+1)=4. So that's four factors, which is less than five. So that's not possible. So statement III is false.\n\nSo putting it all together, the correct statements are only statement II. So looking at the options: option C is II only. But wait, wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait, another thought. I remember that the number of factors is based on exponents in prime factorization. So, for the number of factors to be 5, which is a prime, the only possibility is that the number is a single prime raised to the 4th power. So, yes, statement II is correct.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Suppose the number Q has two primes, but the exponents are arranged such that the product (a+1)(b+1)=5. But since 5 is prime, the only way is one of the terms is 1 and the other is 5. So, for example, if a+1=5 and b+1=1. That would mean a=4, and b=0. But if b=0, then q^0 is 1, so the number is just p^4. So no, you can't have two primes in that case because that would require each exponent to be at least 1. So the only possibility is one prime raised to the 4th power.\n\nSo, the correct answer is statement II only. So looking at the options, option C is II only.\n\nWait, but wait again. Let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA) I only\n\nB) III only\n\nC) II only\n\nD) I and II only\n\nE) I and III only\n\nSo, if only statement II is correct, then the answer is C.\n\nWait, but another thing. What if someone thought that the number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)... So, for 5 factors, since 5 is prime, the only way is a single exponent plus one equals 5. So the exponent is 4. So the number is p^4, which is statement II.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C) II only.\n",
