      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a sporting goods store that sells only yellow and white golf balls. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, the store starts the day with 600 golf balls in stock. By the end of the day, they've sold 80% of their inventory. So first, I should figure out how many golf balls were sold. 80% of 600 is... let me calculate that. 600 times 0.8 is 480. So they sold 480 golf balls.\n\nNow, the problem says that they sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls. Oh wait, and also, in doing so, they sold all of their white golf balls. Hmm. So if they sold all their white golf balls, that means the number of white balls they had initially is equal to the number they sold. Because they started with some white balls and sold all of them.\n\nLet me denote the number of white golf balls at the beginning as W. Since they sold all of them, the number sold of white balls is W. And since they sold an equal number of yellow and white balls, the number of yellow balls sold is also W. So total sold is W (white) + W (yellow) = 2W. But we know the total sold is 480, so 2W = 480. Dividing both sides by 2 gives W = 240. So the store had 240 white golf balls at the start.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the number of yellow golf balls they had to begin with. The total initial stock was 600, which is the sum of yellow and white. So Y + W = 600. We found W is 240, so Y = 600 - 240. Let me do that subtraction: 600 minus 240 is 360. So the store had 360 yellow golf balls at the beginning.\n\nLet me double-check. They had 360 yellow and 240 white. Total is 600, that's correct. They sold 80% of 600, which is 480. They sold 240 white and 240 yellow, totaling 480. That makes sense because they sold all the white ones, and an equal number of yellows. So yes, the initial number of yellow balls was 360.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 360. So the answer should be E.\n",

So they sold 480 golf balls.\n\nNow, the problem says they sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls. Oh, and they sold all of their white golf balls. So that means the number of white balls they had at the start must be equal to half the total sold, right? Because they sold equal numbers of yellow and white. Wait, no. Wait, they sold an equal number of each, but they sold all their white balls. So the number of white balls in stock was exactly the same as the number of white balls sold. \n\nSo, if the total sold is 480, and the white balls sold are half of that, because equal numbers. Wait, no, no. Let me think again. If they sold an equal number of yellow and white, then the number of white sold is equal to the number of yellow sold. So the total sold is white_sold + yellow_sold. Since they're equal, that's 2 * white_sold. So 2 * white_sold = 480. Therefore, white_sold is 240. So they sold 240 white balls. \n\nBut wait, the problem states that in selling those, they sold all of their white golf balls. So the store must have had exactly 240 white balls in stock at the beginning. Because they sold all of them. \n\nSo, the initial stock is 600 balls. If 240 are white, then the rest are yellow. So the number of yellow balls at the beginning is 600 - 240 = 360. Wait, but wait, that's not matching the options. Let me look at the options. Option E is 360. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nWait, no, wait another thing. Wait, when the problem says they sold 80% of their inventory, which is 480. But the white balls sold are 240. So, the initial white balls were 240. Then the initial yellow balls were 600 - 240 = 360. But that would mean that the store had 360 yellow balls. But wait, the question is asking how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day. So the answer would be 360. But looking at the options, E is 360. \n\nWait a minute, but that's not matching with the options presented. Let me check the options again. The options are A)80, B)120, C)240, D)320, E)360. So E is an option. But wait, why am I getting 360? Let me think again.\n\nWait, the store sold 480 balls. They sold equal numbers of yellow and white. So the number sold of each is 240. But since all the white balls were sold, the initial white balls must have been 240. So initial yellows were 600 - 240 = 360. So the answer is E, 360. But wait, why would the options include other numbers like 240 and 320? Did I make a mistake?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe store had 600 at the beginning. Sold 80% by the end, so 480 sold. Sold equal number of yellow and white, and in doing so, sold all of the white. So the white balls in stock were equal to the number sold of white. So the white balls in stock were 240 (since 480 is total, split equally into 240 each). So initial white is 240, initial yellow is 600 -240=360. So E is correct.\n\nWait, but why is option C 240? Oh, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the initial number of white balls. Let me think again. Wait, if all white balls were sold, and the number sold is 240, then yes, initial white is 240. So yellow is 360. So the answer is E.\n\nBut wait, another thought: maybe the 80% refers to each color? No, the problem says sold 80% of its inventory, which is the total. So the total sold is 480. So the reasoning seems correct.\n",
