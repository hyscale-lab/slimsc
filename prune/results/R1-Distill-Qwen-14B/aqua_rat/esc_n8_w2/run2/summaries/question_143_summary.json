      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about two cars starting from the same point and going in the same direction. Both left at the same time. The first car is going 55 mph, and the second is doing 52 mph. The question is asking how long it'll take before they're 15 miles apart. Hmm, I think I remember something about relative speed from physics class.\n\nWait, so since both are moving in the same direction, the faster car is catching up, right? Or wait, no, wait. The first car is faster, so it's moving away from the second. Oh wait, no, if they're going the same direction, the relative speed is the difference between their speeds. Because the first car is faster, it's pulling ahead. So the distance between them increases at the rate of the difference in their speeds.\n\nSo the first car is going 55 mph, the second 52. The difference is 3 mph. So every hour, the distance between them increases by 3 miles. So to find when they're 15 miles apart, I can think of this as a time problem where time multiplied by speed difference equals the desired distance.\n\nLet me write this down. Let t be the time in hours. The distance between them after time t is (55 - 52) * t = 3t. We want this to be 15 miles. So 3t = 15. Solving for t, I get t = 15/3 = 5 hours. So the answer should be 5 hours.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Are there any other factors here? Like, did I account for anything else? I don't think so. The problem is straightforward because they started at the same time, same point, same direction. So the relative speed is just 3 mph. So yeah, 5 hours. Looking at the options, option B is 5 hours. So the answer should be B.\n",

The options are A)3, B)5, C)6, D)4, E)7 hours.\n\nWait, so both cars are moving in the same direction. The first is faster than the second. So the first car is catching up, but wait, no, since they started at the same time, the faster car is moving ahead, leaving the slower one behind. So the distance between them increases over time.\n\nBut wait, the problem says they're 15 miles away from each other. So I need to find the time when the distance between them is 15 miles.\n\nSo let's think about relative speed. Since they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed of the first car with respect to the second is the difference in their speeds. So 55 mph minus 52 mph is 3 mph. That means every hour, the first car is 3 miles ahead of the second.\n\nSo the distance between them increases by 3 miles each hour. We want to know when this distance becomes 15 miles.\n\nOh, right! So time equals distance divided by speed. So time = 15 miles / 3 mph. That's 5 hours. So the answer should be B)5 hours.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. So after 1 hour, the first car has gone 55 miles, the second 52. The difference is 3 miles. After 5 hours, 55*5=275, 52*5=260. 275-260=15 miles. Yep, that works.\n\nSo the correct answer is B.\n",
