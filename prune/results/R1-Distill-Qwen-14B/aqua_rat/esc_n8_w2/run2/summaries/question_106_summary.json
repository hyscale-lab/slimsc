      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Mark and John are talking about exchanging money, and I need to find out how much money John has. Hmm, let me read the problem again carefully.\n\nMark says to John, \"If you give me half your money, I will have Rs.75.\" Then John responds, \"If you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75.\" I need to find out how much John has. The options are A)22, B)60, C)28, D)26, E)18.\n\nWait, so there are two statements here. Let me break them down. Let's assign variables to make this clearer. Let me denote Mark's money as M and John's money as J. So, Mark has M and John has J.\n\nFirst statement: If John gives half his money to Mark, Mark will have Rs.75. So, John gives half of J, which is J/2, to Mark. After that, Mark's new amount is M + J/2, and John's new amount is J - J/2 = J/2. But according to the first statement, Mark's amount after this transaction is 75. So, M + J/2 = 75. That's equation one.\n\nSecond statement: If Mark gives one third of his money to John, John will have Rs.75. So Mark gives (1/3)M to John. Now, Mark's new amount is M - (1/3)M = (2/3)M. John's new amount is J + (1/3)M. According to the statement, John's amount is 75. So, J + (1/3)M = 75. That's equation two.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1) M + (J/2) = 75\n2) J + (M/3) = 75\n\nI need to solve these two equations to find J.\n\nLet me write them again:\n\nEquation 1: M + (J/2) = 75\nEquation 2: J + (M/3) = 75\n\nI can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let's try elimination.\n\nLet me rearrange equation 1 to express M in terms of J.\n\nFrom equation 1: M = 75 - (J/2)\n\nNow substitute this M into equation 2.\n\nEquation 2 becomes: J + ( (75 - J/2) / 3 ) = 75\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, compute (75 - J/2) divided by 3.\n\n(75 - J/2) /3 = (75/3) - (J/2)/3 = 25 - J/(6)\n\nSo equation 2 now is: J + 25 - J/6 = 75\n\nCombine like terms. Let's combine J terms.\n\nJ - J/6 = (6J/6 - J/6) = (5J/6)\n\nSo equation becomes: 5J/6 +25 =75\n\nSubtract 25 from both sides: 5J/6 = 50\n\nMultiply both sides by 6: 5J = 300\n\nDivide by 5: J=60\n\nWait, so J is 60. Looking at the options, option B is 60. So that's the answer.\n\nLet me check the calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nSo equation 1: M + J/2 =75. If J is 60, M is 75 -30=45. So M=45.\n\nCheck equation 2: J + M/3 =60 +15=75. Yep, that works.\n\nLet me verify the initial conditions.\n\nFirst condition: John gives half his money (30) to Mark. Mark had 45, now has 75. Correct.\n\nSecond condition: Mark gives a third of his money (15) to John. John had 60, now has 75. Correct.\n\nSo yes, J is 60. So the answer is B.\n",

Mark tells John, \"If you give me half your money, I will have Rs.75.\" Then John responds, \"If you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75.\" So, both are making statements about what would happen if they exchange a portion of their money.\n\nI think the best approach is to set up some variables. Let me assign variables to the amounts each person has. Let's say Mark has M rupees and John has J rupees. That makes sense.\n\nFirst statement: If John gives half his money to Mark, then Mark will have Rs.75. Wait, no, wait. Let me parse that again. Mark says, \"If you give me half your money, I will have Rs.75.\" So, John is giving half of his money to Mark. So, after giving, Mark's money would be his original M plus half of J. And John's money would be his original J minus half of J, which is J/2.\n\nSo, the first equation is: M + (J/2) = 75. Because Mark's new amount is 75.\n\nSecond statement: John says, \"If you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75.\" So, Mark is giving one third of his money to John. So, Mark's money after giving would be M - (M/3), which is (2M/3). And John's money would be J + (M/3). According to John's statement, this would make John's total Rs.75.\n\nSo the second equation is: J + (M/3) = 75.\n\nNow I have two equations:\n\n1. M + (J/2) = 75\n2.
