      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about population growth. Let me think through it step by step. The question says that the population increases by 5% annually, and the current population is 78,000. We need to find out what the population will be in two years.\n\nHmm, I remember that percentage increase can be calculated using multiplication. So, each year, the population is multiplied by 1 plus the growth rate. Since the growth rate is 5%, that's 0.05 as a decimal. So each year, it's multiplied by 1.05.\n\nWait, but wait, does that mean for two years, I multiply by 1.05 twice? Or is there a formula for compound growth? Oh right, the formula for compound interest (or in this case, population growth) is P = P0 * (1 + r)^t, where P0 is the initial amount, r is the rate, and t is time. So in this case, P0 is 78,000, r is 0.05, and t is 2.\n\nLet me calculate that. First, 1.05 squared. Let me think, 1.05 times 1.05. 1 times 1 is 1, 1 times 0.05 is 0.05, 0.05 times 1 is 0.05, and 0.05 times 0.05 is 0.0025. Adding those up: 1 + 0.05 + 0.05 + 0.0025. That's 1 + 0.1 + 0.0025, which is 1.1025. So the multiplier after two years is 1.1025.\n\nNow, multiply 78,000 by 1.1025. Let me do that step by step. 78,000 times 1 is 78,000. 78,000 times 0.1 is 7,800. 78,000 times 0.0025 is... let's see. 78,000 times 0.002 is 156, and 78,000 times 0.0005 is 39, so together 156 +39 =195. So adding all those parts together: 78,000 +7,800 =85,800, plus 195 gives 85,995. Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check that multiplication because that's where mistakes can happen.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate 78,000 * 1.05 for the first year, then take that result and multiply by 1.05 again for the second year.\n\nFirst year: 78,000 * 1.05. Let me compute that. 78,000 * 1 is 78,000. 78,000 * 0.05 is 3,900. So total is 81,900. That's the population after the first year.\n\nSecond year: 81,900 * 1.05. Hmm, 81,900 *1 is 81,900. 81,900 *0.05 is 4,095. Adding them gives 81,900 +4,095 =85,995. So after two years, it's 85,995.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 85,995. So that must be the correct answer. Wait, but let me check the options again. Option C is 85,800. Oh, wait, why did I get 85,995 when I did the two-step approach. So that must be correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute it using the formula in one step. 78,000 * (1.05)^2. Let's see, 1.05 squared is 1.1025. So 78,000 * 1.1025. Let me compute that. 78,000 *1 is 78,000. 78,000 *0.1 is 7,800. 78,000 *0.0025 is 195. Adding these: 78,000 +7,800 is 85,800. Plus 195 is 85,995. Yep, same result.\n\nSo the correct answer should be 85,995, which is option B. Looking back at the options, option B is indeed 85,995. So the answer is B.\n",

The options are A through E, with E being none of these.\n\nHmm, I remember that percentage increases can be calculated by multiplying the current amount by (1 + the percentage as a decimal).
