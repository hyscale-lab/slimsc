      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where a man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. The trousers cost 70 each, and shirts are 30 each. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are from A to E, each giving a certain number of trousers, so I think the correct option is the one that gives the maximum number of trousers possible without exceeding the total amount.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. The man has a total of 810 rupees. He buys some number of trousers and shirts. Let me denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. So the cost equation would be 70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nThe goal is to maximize T, the number of trousers. So I should find the maximum possible integer value of T such that when I subtract the cost of T trousers from 810, the remaining amount is divisible by 30 (since each shirt is 30 rupees). Because if the remaining money isn't divisible by 30, he can't buy a whole number of shirts.\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\n1. Start with the maximum possible T. The maximum possible T is when all 810 is spent on trousers. 810 divided by 70. Let me calculate that. 70*11 is 770, which is less than 810. 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So maximum possible T is 11, but let me check if that's possible.\n\nWait, but if T is 11, then the cost is 70*11 = 770. The remaining money is 810 -770=40. 40 divided by 30 is 1.333... which is not an integer. So he can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So T=11 is not possible because 40 isn't a multiple of 30.\n\nSo the next step is to try T=10. Let's see: 70*10=700. Remaining money is 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666... again not an integer. So T=10 is also not possible.\n\nNext, T=9: 70*9=630. Remaining is 810-630=180. 180 /30=6, which is an integer. So S=6. So with T=9, S=6, and total cost is 9*70 +6*30= 630 +180=810. Perfect. So that's a possible solution.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Are there any higher T values than 9 that could work? Because we tried 11 and 10 and they didn't work. So the next lower is 9. So 9 is the maximum number of trousers possible.\n\nSo the ratio of trousers to shirts is T:S =9:6. Simplifying that, divide both by 3: 3:2. But the question isn't directly asking for the ratio; it's asking what the ratio is when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. But the options are giving the number of trousers, not the ratio.\n\nWait, the options are all in the form of \"X Trousers\" with X being 7,8,9,10,11. So the question is, when he buys the maximum number of trousers, what is the number of trousers? So in our calculation, the maximum T is 9, so the correct option is A)9 Trousers.\n\nWait, but let me make sure there isn't a higher T possible. Let me check T=12: 70*12=840>810, no. So 11 is too much. T=10 gives 700, 810-700=110, which isn't divisible by 30. So 10 can't work. So 9 is the maximum possible. So the answer should be 9, which is option A.\n",

Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe problem says a man spends 810 rupees buying trousers and shirts. Trousers cost 70 each, and shirts are 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers possible.\n\nHmm, so the goal is to maximize the number of trousers he can buy without exceeding his total budget of 810 rupees. Once we figure that out, we'll know how many shirts he bought along with it, and then we can find the ratio.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S. The total cost is 70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nWe want to maximize T, so we need to find the largest integer value of T such that when multiplied by 70, the remaining money can be exactly divided by 30 for the shirts. Because if the remaining money isn't divisible by 30, he can't buy a fraction of a shirt, right?\n\nSo, the equation is 70T + 30S = 810. Let's rearrange this to solve for S.\n\n30S = 810 - 70T  \nS = (810 -70T)/30\n\nWe can simplify this. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 10 first to make it easier:  \nS = (81 - 7T)/3\n\nWait, 810 divided by 10 is 81, and 70T/10 is 7T, and 30/10 is 3. So yes, S is (81 -7T)/3.\n\nNow, since the number of shirts S must be a whole number, (81 -7T) must be divisible by 3. Let's find T such that 81 -7T is a multiple of 3.\n\nWait, another approach: 70T must be less than or equal to 810. So the maximum possible T without considering shirts would be 810 divided by 70.\n\nLet me compute that: 810 \u00f770. 70*11 is 770, which is less than 810. 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So T can't be more than 11, but maybe 11 is possible? Let's check.\n\nIf T=11, then 70*11=770. Remaining money is 810-770=40. Now, shirts cost 30 each, so 40 divided by 30 is 1 with 10 left. But 10 isn't enough for another shirt, so S would be 1, but the man can't buy a fraction. So he can buy 11 trousers and 1 shirt, but wait, the total cost would be 770+30=800, which is under 810. He has 10 rupees left, but that's okay because he can't buy more shirts with that. So the maximum number of trousers is 11, and shirts would be 1. Then the ratio is 11:1.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check T=11. 70*11=770, 810-770=40. 40 divided by 30 is 1.333. So he can only buy 1 shirt, as you can't buy a third of a shirt. So that works. But is 11 the maximum possible T? Let's see if higher T is possible.\n\nWait, T=12 would be 70*12=840, which is more than 810. So no, 11 is the maximum possible.\n\nSo the ratio is T:S =11:1. Let's check the options. The options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11. So the correct answer should be E)11 Trousers.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the ratio is 11:1. So the correct option is E, which says 11 Trousers. Or wait, the options are each giving the number of trousers, so the answer would be E)11.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check. If he buys 11 trousers, he spends 770, leaving 40. He can buy one shirt (30) and have 10 left, but the problem doesn't say he has to spend all the money, just that he buys as many as he can. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, is there a case where T is less than 11 but allows S to be an integer, but T is higher? No, because 11 is the maximum T possible without exceeding the budget.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where a man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. The trousers are 70 rupees each and the shirts are 30 each. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers possible. The options given are A to E, each with a number of trousers.\n\nHmm, right. So I think the approach here is to maximize the number of trousers he can buy without exceeding the total amount. Since each trouser is more expensive than a shirt, buying more trousers would mean fewer shirts, but we need to find the exact numbers that fit within the 810 rupees.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. The total cost equation would then be:\n\n70*T + 30*S = 810\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible T, so that S is a non-negative integer as well. Because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt or trouser.\n\nSo, the idea is to find the largest T such that (810 -70*T) is divisible by 30, and the result is >=0.\n\nLet me rephrase the equation to solve for S:\n\nS = (810 -70*T)/30\n\nSimplify that. Let's see, 810 divided by 30 is 27. And 70 divided by 30 is 7/3. So:\n\nS = 27 - (7/3)*T\n\nBut since S must be an integer, (7/3)*T must also be an integer. That implies that T must be a multiple of 3. Because 7 is not divisible by 3, so T has to be such that 7*T is divisible by 3, which requires T to be a multiple of 3.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. 70*T must be subtracted from 810, and the result must be divisible by 30. So 70*T mod 30 should be equal to 810 mod 30. Let's compute 810 mod 30. 30*27 is 810, so 810 mod 30 is 0. So 70*T mod 30 must be 0.\n\nBut 70 mod 30 is 10. So 70*T mod 30 = (10*T) mod 30. We need 10*T mod 30 = 0. So 10*T must be a multiple of 30. That simplifies to T must be a multiple of 3, because 10*T = 30*k => T=3*k.\n\nSo T has to be 3,6,9, etc. But we're looking for the maximum possible T without the total cost exceeding 810.\n\nLet's compute the maximum possible T. The maximum T would be when S is zero. So 70*T =810. T=810/70. Let me compute that: 70*11 is 770, 70*12 is 840 which is over 810. So T can't be 12. So maximum possible T is 11, but wait, earlier we saw that T must be a multiple of 3. So 11 is not a multiple of 3. The next lower multiple of 3 is 9.\n\nWait, but 9 is 9, let's check if that works. Let's plug T=9 into the equation:\n\n70*9 = 630. 810-630=180. 180 divided by 30 is 6. So S=6. That's possible. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But wait, the question isn't asking for the ratio; it's asking for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the maximum number of T possible, given the constraints.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that T must be a multiple of 3. So the maximum possible T is 9. But wait, let me check T=10. Is that possible?\n\nWait, let's see. If T=10, then 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666... which is not an integer. So S would not be an integer. So T=10 isn't allowed.\n\nWhat about T=11? 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40/30 is 1.333... Not an integer. So S=1.333, which is not allowed.\n\nSo the next possible is T=9. So the maximum T is 9, with S=6. So the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2. But the question is asking for the ratio of trouser to shirt. So 9:6 reduces to 3:2.\n\nWait, but the options given are A)9 Trousers, etc. So the options are only the number of trousers, not the ratio. So the question is, when he buys the maximum number of trousers, what is the number of trousers? So the answer would be 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Are there any other T values beyond 9 that satisfy the conditions? Let's see T=12 is 840, which is over 810, so no. T=9 is the highest multiple of 3 that doesn't exceed 810.\n\nSo the answer should be 9, which is option A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where a man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. The trousers are 70 rupees each and the shirts are 30 each. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers possible. The options given are A to E, each with a number of trousers.\n\nHmm, right. So I think the approach here is to maximize the number of trousers he can buy without exceeding the total amount. Since each trouser is more expensive than a shirt, buying more trousers would mean fewer shirts, but we need to find the exact numbers that fit within the 810 rupees.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. The total cost equation would then be:\n\n70*T + 30*S = 810\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible T, so that S is a non-negative integer as well.

Let me think again. 70*T must be subtracted from 810, and the result must be divisible by 30. So 70*T mod 30 should be equal to 810 mod 30. Let's compute 810 mod 30. 30*27 is 810, so 810 mod 30 is 0. So 70*T mod 30 must be 0.\n\nBut 70 mod 30 is 10. So 70*T mod 30 = (10*T) mod 30. We need 10*T mod 30 = 0. So 10*T must be a multiple of 30. That simplifies to T must be a multiple of 3, because 10*T = 30*k => T=3*k.\n\nSo T has to be 3,6,9, etc. But we're looking for the maximum possible T without the total cost exceeding 810.\n\nLet's compute the maximum possible T.

Is that possible?\n\nWait, let's see. If T=10, then 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666... which is not an integer. So S would not be an integer.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about a man who spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. Trousers cost 70 each, shirts are 30 each. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are given as A to E, each with a number of trousers.\n\nHmm, so I think the approach here is to maximize the number of trousers he can buy with 810 rupees. Because the question says when the maximum number of trousers is purchased, what is the ratio of trouser to shirt.\n\nWait, but the question isn't directly asking how many shirts or trousers he buys, but the ratio when he buys the maximum number of trousers. So first, I need to find how many trousers he can buy with 810, and then see how much money is left for shirts, which would determine the number of shirts.\n\nSo the first step is to find the maximum number of trousers he can buy. Each trouser is 70 rupees. So divide the total amount by the price per trouser.\n\nTotal money: 810\nCost per trouser: 70\nNumber of trousers = 810 / 70\n\nWait, 70 times 11 is 770, because 70*10=700, plus 70 is 770. 70*12 is 840 which is more than 810. So 11 would be too much. Let me calculate 70*11=770, 70*10=700. So 10 would be 700, leaving 110 for shirts.\n\nWait, but wait, 70*11 is 770, which is less than 810. 770 is under 810. So he can buy 11 trousers, but wait, 11*70=770. Then 810-770=40. Oh, but shirts cost 30 each. So 40 divided by 30 is 1.333. But you can't buy a third of a shirt, so he can buy 1 shirt, which would cost 30, leaving 10 rupees, which isn't enough for another shirt.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again. Because if he buys 11 trousers, the total cost is 770, leaving 40. He can buy 1 shirt for 30, and then 10 remains. But since 10 is less than 30, he can't buy another shirt. So the number of shirts is 1.\n\nBut then the ratio is 11 trousers to 1 shirt, so 11:1. But looking at the options, the options are only the number of trousers, so perhaps the ratio is of the number bought, not the cost. So the ratio is 11:1, but none of the options directly give that. Wait, the options are A)9, B)8, etc. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the man buys as many trousers as possible, but perhaps there's a way to get more by adjusting the number of shirts. Wait, no, because the maximum number of trousers is achieved by spending as much as possible on them, and then whatever is left is spent on shirts.\n\nWait, let's think again. Let me compute 810 divided by 70. 70*11=770, as I said earlier. 770 is less than 810. 70*12=840, which is more than 810, so 11 is the maximum number of trousers he can buy.\n\nWait, but 770 is 810 minus 770 is 40. So 40 rupees left. Can he buy any shirts with that? Shirts are 30 each. 30*1=30, which leaves 10. So yes, he can buy 1 shirt, and 10 rupees remain, which isn't enough for another shirt.\n\nSo total trousers bought: 11, shirts:1. So the ratio is 11:1. But the options don't have 11 as a ratio. Wait, the options are the number of trousers when the maximum is purchased. So the options are A)9, B)8, etc. So looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute it differently. Let me calculate how much money is left after buying 11 trousers.\n\n11*70=770, 810-770=40. Now, with 40, how many shirts can he buy? Each shirt is 30. 40 /30=1.333. So he can buy 1 shirt, which uses 30, leaving 10. So the number of shirts is 1.\n\nThus, the ratio is 11:1. But the options given are only the number of trousers. Wait, the question is asking for the ratio of trouser to shirt when the maximum number of trouser is bought. So the ratio is 11:1, but the options don't show this. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are:\nA)9 Trousers\nB)8 Trousers\nC)10 Trousers\nD)7 Trousers\nE)11 Trousers\n\nWait, E is 11. So the correct answer would be E, 11 trousers. But wait, the question is about the ratio, not the number. Hmm, perhaps the question is phrased differently.\n\nWait, the question says, \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\"\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The man buys 11 trousers, and 1 shirt. So the ratio is 11:1. But the options are only about the number of trousers, so perhaps the correct option is E, 11, which is the maximum number of trousers.\n\nWait, but the question is about the ratio. So perhaps I need to find the ratio of the numbers bought. So 11 trousers to 1 shirt, ratio is 11:1. But the options don't give this as a ratio. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the number of trousers, and the options are the possible numbers, so the correct answer is E)11.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial approach. Maybe the question is about the ratio when the maximum number is purchased, but perhaps the answer is the ratio in terms of the number bought, but the options are just the number of trousers, so E is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this as a linear equation. Let me denote the number of trousers as t and shirts as s. The total cost is 70t +30s =810.\n\nWe need to maximize t, so find the maximum integer t where 70t <=810.\n\nSo 810 \u00f770 is 11.571. So the maximum integer t is 11.\n\nSo t=11.\n\nThen, 70*11=770. So 810-770=40. Now, 40 must be equal to 30s. So 30s=40 \u2192 s=40/30=4/3=1.333. But s must be an integer. So s=1, with 10 rupees left, which isn't enough for another shirt.\n\nSo the ratio of t to s is 11:1.\n\nBut the question is asking for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the ratio is 11:1, but the options are just the number of trousers, so E is 11, which is the maximum number.\n\nSo the answer is E)11 Trousers.\n",

Maybe the question is about the ratio when the maximum number is purchased, but perhaps the answer is the ratio in terms of the number bought, but the options are just the number of trousers, so E is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this as a linear equation. Let me denote the number of trousers as t and shirts as s. The total cost is 70t +30s =810.\n\nWe need to maximize t, so find the maximum integer t where 70t <=810.\n\nSo 810 \u00f770 is 11.571. So the maximum integer t is 11.\n\nSo t=11.\n\nThen, 70*11=770. So 810-770=40. Now, 40 must be equal to 30s. So 30s=40 \u2192 s=40/30=4/3=1.333. But s must be an integer. So s=1, with 10 rupees left, which isn't enough for another shirt.\n\nSo the ratio of t to s is 11:1.\n\nBut the question is asking for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the ratio is 11:1, but the options are just the number of trousers, so E is 11, which is the maximum number.\n\nSo the answer is E)11 Trousers.\n\n\nTo determine the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased, we start by maximizing the number of trousers. Each trouser costs Rs 70, and the total budget is Rs 810. Dividing the total budget by the cost per trouser gives:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Maximum number of trousers} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{810}{70} \\right\\rfloor = 11\n\\]\n\nThus, the man can buy 11 trousers, which costs:\n\n\\[\n11 \\times 70 = 770 \\, \\text{Rs}\n\\]\n\nThis leaves:\n\n\\[\n810 - 770 = 40 \\, \\text{Rs}\n\\]\n\nWith the remaining Rs 40, the man can buy shirts at Rs 30 each. Dividing the remaining budget by the cost per shirt gives:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of shirts} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{30} \\right\\rfloor = 1\n\\]\n\nThus, the man buys 1 shirt. The ratio of trousers to shirts is therefore:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = 11 : 1\n\\]\n\nThe question asks for the number of trousers when the maximum number is purchased, and the options only provide the number of trousers. Since the maximum number of trousers is 11, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: E**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where a man spends 810 rupees buying trousers and shirts. Trousers cost 70 each and shirts 30 each. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. Hmm, wait, ratio? Or is it the count? Oh wait, the options are all in terms of the number of trousers, so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the question again.\n\nWait, the question says, \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" Oh, wait, ratio of trousers to shirts. So, when he buys as many trousers as possible, what is the ratio between the number of trousers and shirts he bought.\n\nSo, first, I need to find the maximum number of trousers he can buy with 810 rupees, and then determine how many shirts he can buy with the remaining money, and then find the ratio of trousers to shirts.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of trousers as t and the number of shirts as s.\n\nThe total cost equation would be: 70t + 30s = 810.\n\nWe need to maximize t, the number of trousers. So we should find the largest integer t such that 70t is less than or equal to 810, and the remaining amount is divisible by 30 to get an integer s.\n\nSo first, find the maximum possible t. Let's compute 810 divided by 70.\n\n810 \u00f7 70 equals approximately 11.57. Since he can't buy a fraction of a trouser, the maximum t is 11. Wait, but 11 * 70 is 770. Let me check: 70 * 11 = 770, then 810 - 770 = 40. Hmm, 40 isn't divisible by 30. So s would be 40/30 = 1.333..., which isn't an integer. So that's a problem.\n\nSo t can't be 11 because then the remaining money doesn't buy a whole number of shirts. So we need to try the next lower integer.\n\nSo t=10: 70*10 = 700. Remaining money is 810 -700 = 110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666..., which is still not an integer. So s isn't an integer here either. So that won't work.\n\nNext, t=9: 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. That's an integer. So s=6.\n\nSo when t=9, s=6. That's valid. So the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6. Simplify that: both are divisible by 3. 9 \u00f73=3, 6 \u00f73=2. So 3:2. But wait, the question is about the ratio, but the options given are all about the number of trousers, not the ratio. Wait, the options are A)9, B)8, etc. Wait, the options are the number of trousers. So the maximum number of trousers he can buy is 9.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check. Because when t=9, s=6 is possible. But what about t=8? Let's see: t=8, 70*8=560. 810-560=250. 250 /30 = 8.333... which isn't an integer. So s would not be a whole number. So t=8 is invalid.\n\nWait, but what about t=7? 70*7=490. 810-490=320. 320/30 = 10.666... Not an integer. So no.\n\nWait, but earlier when t=11, it didn't work because 40/30 is not an integer. So t=11 is invalid. So the next possible t is 9, which works.\n\nWait, but what if there's a higher t that also works? Let me think. Maybe after t=9, can I have another t where the remainder is divisible by 30?\n\nLet me see. Let's try t=12. 70*12=840, which is more than 810, so no.\n\nSo t=11 is the next lower after 12, but as we saw, 70*11=770, 810-770=40. 40/30 is 4/3, not an integer. So no.\n\nt=10: 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 /30 is 11/3, which is about 3.666. Not integer.\n\nt=9: 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. So that's okay.\n\nSo the maximum number of trousers is 9. So the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question is asking for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the ratio would be 9:6, but the options are only about the number of trousers, not the ratio. Wait, the question says, \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\"\n\nWait, the options are A)9 Trousers, which implies the number of trousers, not the ratio.

So the answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, let me read the question again: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So the ratio of the number of trousers to the number of shirts. So the ratio would be 9:6, which is 3:2. But the options don't show ratios; they show the number of trousers. So perhaps the question is phrased differently.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe problem is about a man who spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. Trousers cost 70 each and shirts cost 30 each. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options given are A to E, each with a number of trousers.\n\nHmm. So the goal is to maximize the number of trousers he can buy without exceeding his total budget of 810. Once I find that maximum number, I can figure out how many shirts he bought and then determine the ratio.\n\nLet me think about the variables involved. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. Each trouser is 70, so the cost for T trousers is 70*T. Each shirt is 30, so the cost for S shirts is 30*S. The total cost is 810, so the equation would be:\n\n70T + 30S = 810\n\nI need to find integer values of T and S that satisfy this equation, with T being as large as possible. Because the man is trying to buy the maximum number of trousers, I should maximize T while ensuring that S is also a non-negative integer (he can't buy a negative number of shirts, right?).\n\nSo, the approach here is to express S in terms of T and then find the maximum T such that S is a whole number.\n\nLet's rearrange the equation to solve for S:\n\n30S = 810 - 70T\nS = (810 - 70T) / 30\n\nSimplify that:\n\nS = (810/30) - (70T)/30\nS = 27 - (7T)/3\n\nSince S must be an integer, (7T)/3 must also be an integer because 27 is an integer. So, 7T must be divisible by 3. Alternatively, T must be such that 7T mod 3 equals zero.\n\nWait, 7 mod 3 is 1, so 7T mod 3 is the same as T mod 3. So, T must be a multiple of 3 for (7T)/3 to be an integer.\n\nSo T must be divisible by 3. That gives possible T values as 3,6,9, etc. But we also have a maximum T because the total cost can't exceed 810.\n\nLet's find the maximum possible T. Since each T is 70, the maximum T is when 70T is just less than or equal to 810.\n\nSo, 70*T <= 810\nT <= 810 /70\nCalculating that: 810 divided by 70 is approximately 11.57. So T can't be more than 11, because 12 would be 70*12=840, which is over 810.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought T has to be a multiple of 3. So the possible maximum T could be 11, but 11 isn't a multiple of 3. The next lower multiple is 9, 6, etc.\n\nSo let's check T=11 first. Wait, but T must be a multiple of 3. So 11 isn't a multiple, so we can't have T=11. The next lower is T=9.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. Because even if T isn't a multiple of 3, S might still be an integer if (810 -70T) is divisible by 30. Let me check that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by considering the equation S = (810 -70T)/30.\n\nS must be >=0, so 810 -70T >=0 => 70T <=810 => T <= 810/70 \u224811.57. So maximum possible T is 11.\n\nBut since S has to be an integer, let's try T=11.\n\nS = (810 -70*11)/30\n70*11 is 770. 810-770=40. 40/30 is 1.333... which is not an integer. So T=11 gives S=1.333, which is not possible because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So T=11 is invalid.\n\nNext, try T=10. Is 10 a multiple of 3? 10 divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so no. So S for T=10 would be:\n\nS=(810 -70*10)/30 = (810 -700)/30 = 110/30 = 3.666..., which is not an integer either. So T=10 isn't valid.\n\nNext, T=9. 9 is a multiple of 3. Let's compute S.\n\n70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. So S=6. That's a valid integer. So T=9, S=6.\n\nWait, but could there be a higher T? Let's check T=12. 70*12=840, which is more than 810. So T can't be 12. So the maximum possible T is 9, which gives S=6.\n\nSo the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6. Let me simplify that ratio. Both are divisible by 3: 9/3=3, 6/3=2. So the ratio is 3:2.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2, but the options are given in terms of the number of trousers. Looking back, the options are A)9, B)8, etc. So the number of trousers is 9, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's a higher T that's possible. Wait, what if I made a mistake in the earlier approach? Let me try T=11 again. Wait, T=11 gives S=1.333, which is not allowed. So the next lower T is 10, which gives S=3.666, not allowed. Then T=9, S=6.\n\nWait, what about T=8? Let's see:\n\nS=(810-70*8)/30 = (810-560)/30 = 250/30 \u22488.333, which isn't integer.\n\nT=7: 70*7=490. 810-490=320. 320/30=10.666... nope.\n\nT=6: 70*6=420. 810-420=390. 390/30=13. So S=13. That's a valid integer. So T=6, S=13. But since 9 is higher than 6, and gives a valid S, the maximum T is 9.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the options are just about the number of trousers, so the answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking back, the problem says \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased\". So the ratio is T:S. So when T is 9, S is 6, the ratio is 9:6 or 3:2. But the question is only asking for the number of trousers when maximum is bought, so the answer is 9, option A.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. The question is phrased as \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So perhaps it's asking for the ratio T:S, but the options are the number of trousers. So the options are the number of T, but the correct answer is 9, which is option A. So I think the answer is A)9 Trousers.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of trousers (T) that can be purchased with a total budget of 810 rupees, given that each trouser costs 70 rupees and each shirt costs 30 rupees. The total cost equation is:\n\n\\[\n70T + 30S = 810\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(T\\) is the number of trousers and \\(S\\) is the number of shirts. Rearranging for \\(S\\):\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{810 - 70T}{30}\n\\]\n\nFor \\(S\\) to be an integer, \\((810 - 70T)\\) must be divisible by 30. Simplifying:\n\n\\[\nS = 27 - \\frac{7T}{3}\n\\]\n\nThis implies that \\(T\\) must be a multiple of 3 for \\(\\frac{7T}{3}\\) to be an integer. Additionally, the budget constraint \\(70T \\leq 810\\) gives:\n\n\\[\nT \\leq \\frac{810}{70} \\approx 11.57\n\\]\n\nThus, the maximum possible \\(T\\) is 11.

Substituting \\(T = 9\\):\n\n\\[\nS = 27 - \\frac{7 \\times 9}{3} = 27 - 21 = 6\n\\]\n\nThis gives \\(S = 6\\), which is valid. Checking higher multiples of 3 (e.g., \\(T = 12\\)) exceeds the budget, and lower multiples (e.g., \\(T = 6, 3\\)) result in fewer trousers. Therefore, the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased is \\(T = 9\\), with \\(S = 6\\).\n\nThe ratio of trousers to shirts is \\(9:6\\), but the question only asks for the number of trousers when the maximum is purchased.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe problem is about a man who spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. Trousers cost 70 each and shirts cost 30 each. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options given are A to E, each with a number of trousers.\n\nHmm. So the goal is to maximize the number of trousers he can buy without exceeding his total budget of 810. Once I find that maximum number, I can figure out how many shirts he bought and then determine the ratio.\n\nLet me think about the variables involved. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. Each trouser is 70, so the cost for T trousers is 70*T. Each shirt is 30, so the cost for S shirts is 30*S. The total cost is 810, so the equation would be:\n\n70T + 30S = 810\n\nI need to find integer values of T and S that satisfy this equation, with T being as large as possible. Because the man is trying to buy the maximum number of trousers, I should maximize T while ensuring that S is also a non-negative integer (he can't buy a negative number of shirts, right?).\n\nSo, the approach here is to express S in terms of T and then find the maximum T such that S is a whole number.\n\nLet's rearrange the equation to solve for S:\n\n30S = 810 - 70T\nS = (810 - 70T) / 30\n\nSimplify that:\n\nS = (810/30) - (70T)/30\nS = 27 - (7T)/3\n\nSince S must be an integer, (7T)/3 must also be an integer because 27 is an integer. So, 7T must be divisible by 3. Alternatively, T must be such that 7T mod 3 equals zero.\n\nWait, 7 mod 3 is 1, so 7T mod 3 is the same as T mod 3. So, T must be a multiple of 3 for (7T)/3 to be an integer.\n\nSo T must be divisible by 3. That gives possible T values as 3,6,9, etc. But we also have a maximum T because the total cost can't exceed 810.\n\nLet's find the maximum possible T. Since each T is 70, the maximum T is when 70T is just less than or equal to 810.\n\nSo, 70*T <= 810\nT <= 810 /70\nCalculating that: 810 divided by 70 is approximately 11.57. So T can't be more than 11, because 12 would be 70*12=840, which is over 810.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought T has to be a multiple of 3. So the possible maximum T could be 11, but 11 isn't a multiple of 3. The next lower multiple is 9, 6, etc.\n\nSo let's check T=11 first. Wait, but T must be a multiple of 3. So 11 isn't a multiple, so we can't have T=11. The next lower is T=9.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. Because even if T isn't a multiple of 3, S might still be an integer if (810 -70T) is divisible by 30. Let me check that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by considering the equation S = (810 -70T)/30.\n\nS must be >=0, so 810 -70T >=0 => 70T <=810 => T <= 810/70 \u224811.57. So maximum possible T is 11.\n\nBut since S has to be an integer, let's try T=11.\n\nS = (810 -70*11)/30\n70*11 is 770. 810-770=40. 40/30 is 1.333... which is not an integer. So T=11 gives S=1.333, which is not possible because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So T=11 is invalid.\n\nNext, try T=10. Is 10 a multiple of 3? 10 divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so no. So S for T=10 would be:\n\nS=(810 -70*10)/30 = (810 -700)/30 = 110/30 = 3.666..., which is not an integer either. So T=10 isn't valid.\n\nNext, T=9. 9 is a multiple of 3. Let's compute S.\n\n70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. So S=6. That's a valid integer. So T=9, S=6.\n\nWait, but could there be a higher T? Let's check T=12. 70*12=840, which is more than 810. So T can't be 12. So the maximum possible T is 9, which gives S=6.\n\nSo the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6. Let me simplify that ratio. Both are divisible by 3: 9/3=3, 6/3=2. So the ratio is 3:2.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2, but the options are given in terms of the number of trousers. Looking back, the options are A)9, B)8, etc. So the number of trousers is 9, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's a higher T that's possible. Wait, what if I made a mistake in the earlier approach? Let me try T=11 again. Wait, T=11 gives S=1.333, which is not allowed. So the next lower T is 10, which gives S=3.666, not allowed. Then T=9, S=6.\n\nWait, what about T=8? Let's see:\n\nS=(810-70*8)/30 = (810-560)/30 = 250/30 \u22488.333, which isn't integer.\n\nT=7: 70*7=490. 810-490=320. 320/30=10.666... nope.\n\nT=6: 70*6=420. 810-420=390. 390/30=13. So S=13. That's a valid integer. So T=6, S=13. But since 9 is higher than 6, and gives a valid S, the maximum T is 9.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the options are just about the number of trousers, so the answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking back, the problem says \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased\". So the ratio is T:S. So when T is 9, S is 6, the ratio is 9:6 or 3:2. But the question is only asking for the number of trousers when maximum is bought, so the answer is 9, option A.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. The question is phrased as \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So perhaps it's asking for the ratio T:S, but the options are the number of trousers. So the options are the number of T, but the correct answer is 9, which is option A. So I think the answer is A)9 Trousers.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of trousers (T) that can be purchased with a total budget of 810 rupees, given that each trouser costs 70 rupees and each shirt costs 30 rupees.
