      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about an election meeting with 10 speakers. The condition is that whenever they speak, the Prime Minister (PM) should speak before the Member of Parliament (MP), and the MP before the Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA). I need to find out in how many ways the meeting can be held following this protocol. The options are given as various factorials divided by numbers.\n\nHmm, let me think. So, the main thing here is the order in which PM, MP, and MLA speak. Wait, but wait a second\u2014does each of the 10 speakers consist of one PM, one MP, and one MLA, or are they all PMs, MPs, or MLAs? The question says \"the only protocol to be observed is that whenever they speak the pm should speak before the mp and the mp before the mla.\" Oh, so maybe each of the 10 speakers is one of these three roles? Or perhaps each speaker is either a PM, MP, or MLA, and the order between PM, MP, and MLA matters?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that among the 10 speakers, there are specific roles. Like, perhaps one speaker is the PM, another is the MP, and another is the MLA. But that might not make sense because 10 is a lot. Alternatively, maybe each speaker is either PM, MP, or MLA, and the condition is that whenever a PM speaks, they must come before an MP, and the MP before an MLA. So for example, if there are multiple PMs, they all come before any MP, and all MPs come before any MLA.\n\nWait, that might complicate things. Let me re-read the problem. It says, \"the only protocol to be observed is that whenever they speak the pm should speak before the mp and the mp should speak before the mla.\" Hmm, perhaps it's that in the sequence of speakers, all PMs must come before any MP, and all MPs before any MLA. So the order would be PMs first, then MPs, then MLAs.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the pm\" and \"the mp\"\u2014singular. So maybe there's only one PM, one MP, and one MLA among the 10 speakers. So that's 3 specific people, and the other 7 are perhaps others who don't have these roles. So the condition is that in the speaking order, PM comes before MP, and MP comes before MLA. The other 7 can be in any order as long as this condition is met.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"10 speakers are to address the meeting.\" So perhaps the 10 include one PM, one MP, and one MLA, and the rest are others. So, the protocol requires that PM speaks before MP, and MP before MLA. The others can be anywhere else.\n\nWait, but that complicates it because the others can be anywhere else, but the three specific roles must follow that order. So the problem reduces to counting the number of permutations where PM comes before MP, which comes before MLA. The other 7 can be in any order, but the three key positions must be ordered as PM < MP < MLA.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that each of the 10 speakers is either a PM, MP, or MLA, but that seems unlikely because the problem mentions 'the pm', 'the mp', 'the mla'\u2014singular. So probably, there are exactly three specific people: one PM, one MP, one MLA. The remaining seven are others without specific roles.\n\nSo, the problem is to arrange 10 speakers, where three of them are PM, MP, MLA, and the rest are others. The condition is that PM must come before MP, and MP before MLA. The others can be anywhere else.\n\nSo, how do we compute this? Well, the total number of possible arrangements without any constraints is 10! (since all 10 are distinct individuals).\n\nBut we have constraints on the order of PM, MP, and MLA. Specifically, PM must come before MP, and MP before MLA.\n\nIn permutations, the number of ways where PM comes before MP comes before MLA is a specific fraction of the total permutations. Because in any permutation of the three, the number of valid orderings is just 1 out of the 3! possible orderings. Because for any permutation of these three, only one of the 6 possible orderings (PM, MP, MLA) is acceptable.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. For the three specific people, the number of possible orderings that satisfy PM < MP < MLA is 1 out of 6. So the fraction is 1/6 of the total permutations.\n\nSo the total number of valid arrangements is (10! ) * (1/6) = 10! /6.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. What about the other seven people? They can be in any position as long as the order of PM, MP, MLA is maintained. So the three must appear in that specific order, but can be anywhere in the 10 positions as long as their relative order is maintained.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is to consider that among the 10 positions, the three specific roles (PM, MP, MLA) must be placed in increasing order. The number of ways to choose the positions for PM, MP, and MLA is C(10,3) (combinations of 10 choose 3 positions), and then for each such selection, their order must be PM before MP before MLA, which is exactly one ordering.\n\nThe remaining 7 can be arranged in 7! ways. So the total number would be C(10,3) * 7! = (10! )/(3!7! ) ) *7! )= 10! /6.\n\nAh, that makes sense. Because C(10,3) is 10!/(3!7!), multiplied by 7! gives 10!/(3! * 7! ) *7! = 10!/(3! ) = 10!/(6). So the answer is 10! /6.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 10!/6. So the correct answer should be B.\n",
