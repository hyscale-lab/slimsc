      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a rectangular piece of land. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The area is given as 150 square meters, and the length is 1 meter more than four times the breadth. I need to find the perimeter. Hmm, alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that for a rectangle, the area is calculated by multiplying the length and the breadth. So, area = length \u00d7 breadth. And the perimeter is 2 times the sum of length and breadth, right? So perimeter = 2*(length + breadth). But I need to find the perimeter, but first, I probably need to find the actual length and breadth.\n\nThe problem states that the length is 1m more than four times the breadth. Let me represent the breadth with a variable. Let's say the breadth is 'b' meters. Then the length would be 4 times that plus 1, so length = 4b + 1.\n\nNow, since the area is 150, I can set up an equation: length \u00d7 breadth = 150. Substituting the length from earlier, that becomes (4b + 1) * b = 150. Expanding that, I get 4b\u00b2 + b = 150.\n\nWait, that's a quadratic equation. Let me rearrange it to standard form. Subtract 150 from both sides: 4b\u00b2 + b - 150 = 0. Now I have 4b\u00b2 + b -150 = 0. Hmm, solving this quadratic should give me the value of b.\n\nI can use the quadratic formula here. The formula is b = [-B \u00b1 sqrt(B\u00b2 -4AC)]/(2A), where A is 4, B is 1, and C is -150. Let me plug in those numbers.\n\nSo, discriminant D = B\u00b2 -4AC = (1)^2 - 4*4*(-150) = 1 + 2400 = 2401. Oh, 2401 is a perfect square, right? Because 49*49 is 2401. So sqrt(2401) is 49.\n\nNow, plugging back into the formula: b = [-1 \u00b149]/(2*4). Let's compute both possibilities.\n\nFirst possibility: [-1 +49]/8 = 48/8 =6. Second possibility: [-1 -49]/8 = -50/8 = -6.25. But since breadth can't be negative, we discard the negative value. So b=6 meters.\n\nNow that I have the breadth, I can find the length. Length =4b +1 =4*6 +1=24+1=25 meters.\n\nNow, let's check if this makes sense. Area is 25*6=150, which matches. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the perimeter is 2*(length + breadth) =2*(25 +6)=2*31=62 meters. Looking at the options, option C is 62 m. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations. Did I make any mistakes in the quadratic solution?\n\nThe quadratic equation was 4b\u00b2 + b -150=0. So A=4, B=1, C=-150.\n\nDiscriminant: 1 + 2400=2401. Sqrt(2401)=49. So, yes, correct.\n\nSo the roots are (-1 +49)/8=48/8=6 and the other negative. So b=6 is correct.\n\nThen length is 4*6+1=25. Perimeter: 2*(25+6)=62. Yes, that's correct. So the answer is C.\n",

Got that.\n\nThe problem also says the length is 1 meter more than four times the breadth. Oh wait, so if I let the breadth be some variable, say 'b', then the length would be 4 times that plus 1. So, length = 4b + 1. That makes sense.\n\nAlright, so let's write down the equations I have:\n\n1. Area = length \u00d7 breadth = 150 m\u00b2.\n2. Length = 4 * breadth + 1.\n\nSo substituting the second equation into the first, I can write:\n\n(4b + 1) * b = 150.\n\nLet me expand that. 4b * b is 4b\u00b2, and 1 * b is b. So, 4b\u00b2 + b = 150.\n\nHmm, that's a quadratic equation. To solve for b, I should rearrange it into standard form. Subtract 150 from both sides:\n\n4b\u00b2 + b - 150 = 0.\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation. Quadratic equations can be solved using the quadratic formula, which is (-B \u00b1 sqrt(B\u00b2 - 4AC)) / (2A), where A is 4, B is 1, and C is -150.\n\nLet me plug in those values. So, B squared is 1^2 =1. 4AC is 4*4*(-150) = 4*4=16, 16*(-150)= -2400. So, the discriminant (the part under the square root) is 1 - (4*4*(-150)).\n\nWait, wait, no, wait. The discriminant is B\u00b2 - 4AC. So, 1 - (4 *4 * (-150)). Let me calculate that: 4*4 is 16, 16*(-150) is -2400. So, 1 - (-2400) is 1 + 2400, which is 2401.\n\nAh, the square root of 2401 is 49 because 49*49 is 2401. Oh right, that's a perfect square. So, the solutions are:\n\nb = [ -1 \u00b1 49 ] / (2*4) = [ -1 \u00b1 49 ] / 8.\n\nSo there are two possible solutions:\n\n1. [ -1 + 49 ] /8 = 48/8 =6.\n2. [ -1 -49 ] /8 = -50/8 = -6.25.\n\nBut breadth can't be negative, so we take the positive solution. So, b =6 meters.\n\nNow, the length is 4b +1, so plugging in b=6: 4*6=24, plus 1 is 25. So length is 25 meters.\n\nWait, let me double-check the area. 25 *6 is 150. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNow, the question is about the perimeter. Perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + breadth).

The discriminant is B\u00b2 - 4AC. So, 1 - (4 *4 * (-150)). Let me calculate that: 4*4 is 16, 16*(-150) is -2400. So, 1 - (-2400) is 1 + 2400, which is 2401.\n\nAh, the square root of 2401 is 49 because 49*49 is 2401. Oh right, that's a perfect square.
