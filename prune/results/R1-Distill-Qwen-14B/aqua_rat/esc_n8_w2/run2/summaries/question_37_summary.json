      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a shopkeeper selling a watch. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says that when the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, he gets some profit. But if he gives a 7% discount, his profit is Rs.15 less. I need to find the marked price of the watch.\n\nWait, let's break this down. The marked price is the original price before any discounts, right? So the shopkeeper is selling it at a discounted price, but what about his cost price? I think I need to consider that as well. Oh wait, the problem doesn't give me the cost price directly. Hmm, maybe I can relate the two scenarios where the discounts are different, leading to a difference in profit of Rs.15.\n\nLet me denote the marked price as M. When he gives a 5% discount, the selling price (SP1) would be M minus 5% of M. So SP1 = M * (1 - 0.05) = 0.95 M.\n\nSimilarly, when the discount is 7%, the selling price (SP2) would be M * (1 - 0.07) = 0.93 M.\n\nThe problem states that when he gives the 7% discount, his profit is Rs.15 less. So the profit in the first case is higher by Rs.15 than the second case.\n\nBut wait, profit is calculated as selling price minus cost price. Let's denote the cost price as C. So in the first case, profit P1 = SP1 - C = 0.95 M - C. In the second case, profit P2 = SP2 - C = 0.93 M - C.\n\nAccording to the problem, P1 - P2 = 15. So substituting the values:\n\n(0.95 M - C) - (0.93 M - C) = 15.\n\nLet me compute that. The Cs cancel out. So 0.95 M - 0.93 M = 15. That's 0.02 M =15. Solving for M, M=15 / 0.02. Let me calculate that.\n\n15 divided by 0.02 is the same as 15 multiplied by 50, which is 750. So the marked price M is Rs.750.\n\nWait, looking at the options, option D is Rs.750. So the answer should be D.\n\nBut let me double-check my steps. Did I make any mistake in the equations?\n\nI set up the profits correctly based on the selling prices. Then the difference between P1 and P2 is 15, which is correct because when the discount increases, profit decreases. So the difference in the two selling prices is 0.02 M, which equals 15. So M is 750. That makes sense. So yeah, option D is the right answer.\n",

The question says that when the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, he makes a certain profit. But when he gives a 7% discount, his profit is Rs. 15 less. The question is asking for the marked price of the watch.\n\nWait, let's break it down. So, the marked price is the price before any discount, right? Let me think about the variables involved. There's the cost price, which is how much the shopkeeper bought the watch for, and the selling price, which is what he sells it for after the discount. His profit would be the selling price minus the cost price.\n\nLet me denote the marked price as M. So, when he gives a 5% discount, the selling price becomes M minus 5% of M. That's the same as 95% of M. Similarly, a 7% discount would make the selling price 93% of M.\n\nBut wait, how does the profit come into play here? Oh, right! Profit is Selling Price minus Cost Price. So, if the selling price is lower when he gives a higher discount, his profit decreases. The problem says that when he gives a 7% discount, he earns Rs. 15 less than when he gives a 5% discount.\n\nSo, let me write this out. Let's say the cost price is C. Then, when he sells at a 5% discount, the selling price (SP1) is 0.95 * M. His profit would be SP1 - C. When he sells at a 7% discount, the selling price (SP2) is 0.93 * M, and the profit is SP2 - C.\n\nThe difference between these two profits is Rs. 15. So, (SP1 - C) - (SP2 - C) = 15. Oh, wait, because the profit when giving 5% is higher, and giving 7% is Rs.15 less. So, SP1 - C - (SP2 - C) = 15. The Cs cancel out, so SP1 - SP2 = 15.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, 0.95M - 0.93M = 15. Let's compute that. 0.95M - 0.93M is 0.02M. So, 0.02M = 15. Therefore, M is 15 divided by 0.02.\n\nLet me calculate that. 15 divided by 0.02 is the same as 15 multiplied by 50, which is 750. So M is 750 rupees.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is 750. So that's probably the answer. But wait, let me double-check because sometimes these problems can have a twist.\n\nLet me see: If the marked price is 750, then 5% discount is 37.5, so selling price is 750 - 37.5 = 712.5. At 7% discount, it's 750 * 0.93 = 697.5. The difference between 712.5 and 697.5 is 15, which matches the problem statement. So yes, the marked price is 750.\n\nSo the correct answer should be D) Rs. 750.\n",
