      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about discounts on tyres. Hmm, let's see. The manufacturer is giving a 20% discount on tubeless tyres. Then some retailers are offering additional discounts. In this case, a retailer is giving another 20% off. I need to find the total discount available at that retailer. \n\nWait, wait. So the manufacturer's discount is first applied, right? Then the retailer's discount is applied to the already discounted price. Oh, right, because discounts stack, but they don't just add up directly. Let me think about how percentages work here.\n\nLet me break it down. Suppose the original price of a tyre is $100. That makes the math easier. So without any discounts, it's $100. \n\nThe manufacturer gives a 20% discount. So 20% of 100 is 20. So the price after the manufacturer's discount is 100 -20 = $80.\n\nNow the retailer offers an additional 20% discount. But wait, this is 20% of the new price, not the original. So 20% of $80. Let me calculate that. 20% is 0.2, so 0.2 *80 = 16. So the retailer's discount is $16.\n\nSubtracting that from $80 gives me 80 -16 = $64. So the final price is $64.\n\nWait, what's the total discount? The original price was $100, final is $64. So the total discount is 100-64 = $36. So the discount percentage is 36% of the original price.\n\nBut wait, another way to calculate it is to think about the combined effect. The first discount is 20%, so the price becomes 80% of the original. The second discount is another 20%, so it's 80% of the already discounted price. So 80% of 80% is 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64, or 64% of the original. So the total discount is 100% -64% =36%.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 36%. So that must be the answer.\n\nBut wait, someone might think that 20% plus another 20% equals 40%. But that's not how discounts work. Because the second discount is applied to the reduced price, not the original. So adding the percentages isn't the right approach. It's the product of the multipliers. So 0.8 *0.8=0.64, as I thought.\n\nSo the correct answer is E)36%.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the total discount available at the retailer, we analyze the discounts step by step. Let the original price of the tyre be $100.\n\n1.

The question is, if a retailer offers an additional 20% discount, what's the total discount? Hmm.\n\nWait, so the manufacturer's discount is 20%, and then the retailer gives another 20% off. But I think I shouldn't just add them up because that would be 40%, which doesn't match any of the options. So I must be missing something.\n\nOh right, when you apply two discounts successively, you don't add them. Instead, the second discount is applied after the first one. Let me think about how that works. \n\nSuppose the original price of the tyre is $100. That makes calculations easier. The manufacturer's discount is 20%, so the price after that would be 100 minus 20% of 100. 20% of 100 is 20, so the price becomes $80.\n\nNow, the retailer gives an additional 20% discount on this new price.

Original was $100, final is $64. That's a $36 discount. So the total discount percentage is (36/100)*100% = 36%.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 36%. So that must be the correct answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the combined discount as multiplying the two discounts. The first discount leaves 80% of the price (since 100% - 20% = 80%). The second discount leaves 80% of that, so 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64, or 64% of the original price.
