      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve. Let me try to understand it step by step. \n\nThe problem says that a group of friends planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables for their picnic. But then, four of them didn't show up. Because of that, the remaining friends had to each contribute Rs. 4 extra. I need to find out how many of them actually attended the picnic.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to model this. So originally, there were a certain number of friends, let's say N. They all were supposed to split the Rs.96 equally. So each person's share would be 96 divided by N. \n\nBut then four friends didn't come, so the number of attendees became N - 4. Now, the cost remains the same at Rs.96, but since there are fewer people, each person has to pay more. Specifically, each person pays Rs.4 more than they originally planned. \n\nWait, so the original share per person was 96/N. After four didn't come, the new share is 96/(N-4). And this new share is equal to the original share plus 4. So I can set up an equation: \n\n96/(N - 4) = (96/N) + 4 \n\nHmm, that makes sense. Now I need to solve for N.\n\nLet me write that equation again:\n\n96/(N - 4) = 96/N + 4 \n\nI can rearrange this equation to find N. Let's subtract 96/N from both sides to get:\n\n96/(N - 4) - 96/N = 4 \n\nI can factor out 96 from both terms on the left:\n\n96 [1/(N -4) - 1/N ] =4 \n\nLet me compute the part inside the brackets. 1/(N-4) minus 1/N equals [N - (N-4)] / [N(N-4)] \n\nWhich simplifies to [4]/[N(N-4)] \n\nSo now the equation becomes:\n\n96 * [4/(N(N-4))] =4 \n\nSimplify left side: 96 *4 is 384. So,\n\n384 / [N(N-4)] =4 \n\nMultiply both sides by N(N-4):\n\n384 =4 * N(N-4) \n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n96 = N(N-4) \n\nSo now the equation is N squared minus 4N equals 96. Let's write it as a quadratic equation:\n\nN\u00b2 -4N -96 =0 \n\nWait, solving this quadratic equation. Let me see if I can factor it. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -96 and add to -4. Hmm, factors of 96 are 12 and 8, because 12*8=96. Oh, wait, 12 and -8 would give 12*(-8)=-96, and 12 + (-8)=4. But in our equation, the middle term is -4N, so maybe I have the signs wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the quadratic formula here.\n\nQuadratic equation is ax\u00b2 +bx +c=0. So here a=1, b=-4, c=-96.\n\nQuadratic formula: N = [4 \u00b1 sqrt( (\u22124)^2 \u22124*1*(-96) ) ]/(2*1 )\n\nCalculating discriminant: 16 + 384 = 400. sqrt(400)=20.\n\nSo N = [4 \u00b120 ]/2 \n\nSo two solutions: (4+20)/2=24/2=12, and (4-20)/2= -16/2=-8.\n\nSince the number of people can't be negative, N=12.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. The problem is asking for the number of those who attended, not the original number. Because N is the original number. Four didn't attend, so attendees are N-4=12-4=8. \n\nWait, but looking at the options, 8 is option A. But wait, let me double-check. Because sometimes when I set up equations, I might have mixed up the variables.\n\nWait, let me go through it again. Let me define N as the number of friends who attended. No, wait, no. Wait, the original plan was for N friends, but four didn't come, so attendees are N-4. Wait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the problem says that four of them did not turn up. So the number that attended is N -4, where N was the original number. So the original N was 12, so the attendees are 8. So the answer is 8, which is option A. \n\nWait, but let me check the calculations again. Because sometimes when I solve equations, I might have made a mistake.\n\nSo the equation was: \n\n96/(N-4) = 96/N +4 \n\nLet me plug N=12 into the equation.\n\nLeft side: 96/(12-4)=96/8=12.\n\nRight side: 96/12 +4=8 +4=12. \n\nYes, that works. So N=12 was the original number. So attendees were 12-4=8, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, the options include 8, 12, etc. So the answer would be A)8. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the question. Wait, the problem is asking for the number of those who attended, which is N-4. So if N=12, the attendees are 8. So the answer is 8, option A.\n\nSo the correct option is A)8.\n",

Because of that, each of the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra. The question is asking how many attended.\n\nHmm, right. Let's break this down. So initially, there were a certain number of friends. Let's call that number 'x'. They planned to split Rs. 96 equally. So each was supposed to pay 96 divided by x.\n\nBut four friends didn't come.

Yes, that matches the problem statement.\n\nSo the correct answer should be 8, which is option A.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining how many friends attended the picnic. Initially, let the total number of friends be \\( x \\). They planned to split Rs. 96 equally, so each friend was supposed to pay \\( \\frac{96}{x} \\). However, four friends did not attend, leaving \\( x - 4 \\) friends. As a result, each attendee had to pay Rs. 4 extra, making the new share \\( \\frac{96}{x - 4} \\).\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{96}{x - 4} = \\frac{96}{x} + 4\n\\]\n\nRearranging and simplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{96}{x - 4} - \\frac{96}{x} = 4\n\\]\n\nFinding a common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{96x - 96(x - 4)}{x(x - 4)} = 4\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the numerator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{384}{x(x - 4)} = 4\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\( x(x - 4) \\):\n\n\\[\n384 = 4x(x - 4)\n\\]\n\nDividing by 4:\n\n\\[\n96 = x(x - 4)\n\\]\n\nThis leads to the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x - 96 = 0\n\\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula \\( x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) with \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), and \\( c = -96 \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(1)(-96)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 384}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm 20}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis gives two solutions:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4 + 20}{2} = 12 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = \\frac{4 - 20}{2} = -8\n\\]\n\nSince \\( x \\) represents the number of people, it must be positive, so \\( x = 12 \\). The number of attendees is \\( x - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 \\).\n\nVerifying: If 12 friends were originally planned, each would pay \\( \\frac{96}{12} = 8 \\) Rs. With 8 attendees, each pays \\( \\frac{96}{8} = 12 \\) Rs, which is Rs. 4 extra. This matches the problem statement.\n\nThus, the number of attendees is **8**, corresponding to option **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",
