      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about mixing sand and clay. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that there's a 10kg mixture which is 30% sand and 70% clay. We need to find out how much of this mixture should be removed and replaced with pure sand to make the mixture have equal parts clay and sand. Hmm, right.\n\nLet me start by understanding the current composition. 30% sand in 10kg means the amount of sand is 0.3 * 10 = 3kg. The clay is 70%, so that's 0.7 * 10 =7kg. So right now, there's 3kg sand and 7kg clay.\n\nThe goal is to make the mixture have equal amounts of sand and clay. So each should be 5kg in a total of 10kg mixture. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Wait a minute. Because if the total is still 10kg, then 5kg each would make sense. But I'm not sure if the total remains 10kg because we are removing some and adding back. Oh, the question says \"how much of the mixture is to be removed and replaced with pure sand.\" So the total remains 10kg because whatever is removed is replaced with sand. So yes, the final mixture is still 10kg, but with 5kg sand and 5kg clay.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you remove some mixture and replace it with pure sand, the total amount after replacement is the same as before, right? Because you take out X kg and add X kg of sand. So yes, the total is 10kg.\n\nSo, let's let X be the amount of mixture we remove. When we remove X kg of the mixture, we're removing 30% sand and 70% clay from that X. So the amount of sand removed is 0.3X, and clay removed is 0.7X.\n\nAfter removal, the remaining sand would be 3 - 0.3X, and remaining clay would be 7 - 0.7X. Then we add X kg of pure sand. So the new sand amount is (3 - 0.3X) + X = 3 + 0.7X. The clay remains at 7 - 0.7X.\n\nWe want the sand and clay to be equal, so:\n\n3 + 0.7X = 7 - 0.7X\n\nLet me solve for X.\n\nBring the 0.7X terms to one side. So:\n\n3 + 0.7X + 0.7X =7\n\n3 + 1.4X =7\n\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n\n1.4X =4\n\nX =4 /1.4\n\nHmm, 4 divided by 1.4. Let me compute that. 1.4 is 14/10, so 4 divided by (14/10) is 4 * (10/14) = 40/14 =20/7.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, B is 20/7, which is approximately 2.857 kg. So the answer should be option B.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my steps. Because sometimes when you're dealing with mixtures, it's easy to mix up the percentages.\n\nOriginal mixture: 10kg, 3kg sand, 7kg clay.\n\nLet X be the amount removed. The fraction of sand in the mixture is 0.3, so X kg removed contains 0.3X sand and 0.7X clay.\n\nAfter removal:\n\nSand left: 3 -0.3X\n\nClay left:7 -0.7X\n\nThen, add X kg of pure sand. So new sand is (3-0.3X) + X =3 +0.7X\n\nClay remains at 7-0.7X.\n\nWe set them equal:\n\n3 +0.7X =7 -0.7X\n\nAdding 0.7X to both sides: 3 +1.4X =7\n\n1.4X =4 \u2192 X=4/(1.4)= 40/14=20/7.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the correct answer is B) 20/7.\n",

Oh, wait, so we want the final mixture to have equal parts sand and clay. That means each should be 5kg because the total is 10kg. So, the sand needs to go from 3kg to 5kg, and the clay from 7kg to 5kg.\n\nBut wait, I'm removing some mixture and adding pure sand. So when I remove the mixture, I'm removing both sand and clay. Let's think about that.\n\nLet me denote x as the amount of mixture to be removed. Since the mixture is 30% sand and 70% clay, when I remove x kg, I'm taking away 0.3x kg of sand and 0.7x kg of clay. So, the remaining sand is 3 - 0.3x, and the remaining clay is 7 - 0.7x.\n\nThen, I'm adding pure sand, which is x kg (since I'm replacing the removed mixture with sand, right?), so the total sand becomes (3 - 0.3x) + x = 3 + 0.7x kg.\n\nThe clay remains at (7 - 0.7x) because I'm only adding sand. \n\nWe want the sand and clay to be equal, so set them equal:\n\n3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x\n\nLet me solve for x. So, bring the 0.7x terms together:\n\n0.7x + 0.7x = 7 - 3\n1.4x = 4\nx = 4 / 1.4\nHmm, 4 divided by 1.4.

So, removing about 2.857 kg of the mixture and replacing it with pure sand.\n\nLet me double-check the math. Original sand is 3kg, clay 7kg.\n\nAfter removing x kg, which is 20/7 kg:\n\nSand removed: 0.3 * (20/7) = 6/7 kg. Remaining sand: 3 - 6/7 = (21/7 - 6/7) = 15/7 kg.\n\nClay removed: 0.7 * (20/7) = 14/7 = 2 kg. Remaining clay: 7 - 2 = 5 kg.\n\nThen, adding x kg (20/7 kg) of pure sand. So new sand is 15/7 + 20/7 = 35/7 = 5 kg. Clay remains at 5 kg. So yes, equal.\n\nSo the answer should be 20/7 kg, which is option B.\n",

So, bring the 0.7x terms together:\n\n0.7x + 0.7x = 7 - 3\n1.4x = 4\nx = 4 / 1.4\nHmm, 4 divided by 1.4. Let's calculate that. 1.4 is the same as 14/10, so 4 / (14/10) = 4 * (10/14) = 40/14 = 20/7. \n\nWait, so x is 20/7 kg. Let me check that. 20 divided by 7 is approximately 2.857 kg. So, removing about 2.857 kg of the mixture and replacing it with pure sand.\n\nLet me double-check the math. Original sand is 3kg, clay 7kg.\n\nAfter removing x kg, which is 20/7 kg:\n\nSand removed: 0.3 * (20/7) = 6/7 kg. Remaining sand: 3 - 6/7 = (21/7 - 6/7) = 15/7 kg.\n\nClay removed: 0.7 * (20/7) = 14/7 = 2 kg. Remaining clay: 7 - 2 = 5 kg.\n\nThen, adding x kg (20/7 kg) of pure sand. So new sand is 15/7 + 20/7 = 35/7 = 5 kg. Clay remains at 5 kg. So yes, equal.\n\nSo the answer should be 20/7 kg, which is option B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by determining the initial amounts of sand and clay in the 10 kg mixture. Since the mixture is 30% sand and 70% clay, we calculate:\n\n- Sand: \\( 0.3 \\times 10 = 3 \\, \\text{kg} \\)\n- Clay: \\( 0.7 \\times 10 = 7 \\, \\text{kg} \\)\n\nThe goal is to make the mixture contain equal quantities of sand and clay, i.e., 5 kg each.

When \\( x \\, \\text{kg} \\) of the mixture is removed, the amounts of sand and clay removed are:\n\n- Sand removed: \\( 0.3x \\, \\text{kg} \\)\n- Clay removed: \\( 0.7x \\, \\text{kg} \\)\n\nAfter removal, the remaining sand is \\( 3 - 0.3x \\, \\text{kg} \\), and the remaining clay is \\( 7 - 0.7x \\, \\text{kg} \\). Adding \\( x \\, \\text{kg} \\) of pure sand results in a total sand content of:\n\n\\[\n(3 - 0.3x) + x = 3 + 0.7x \\, \\text{kg}\n\\]\n\nThe clay content remains at \\( 7 - 0.7x \\, \\text{kg} \\). To make the sand and clay equal, we set the two quantities equal:\n\n\\[\n3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n0.7x + 0.7x = 7 - 3\n\\]\n\\[\n1.4x = 4\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4}{1.4} = \\frac{20}{7} \\, \\text{kg}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( 20/7 \\, \\text{kg} \\) of the mixture must be removed and replaced with pure sand to achieve equal quantities of sand and clay.
