      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the total bus fare for a group of people. Let me think through it step by step. \n\nAlright, the question says that the bus fare for one adult from Ranchi to Patna is Rs. 140. And for a child, it's half the adult fare. So first, I should figure out how much a child's ticket costs.\n\nWait, half of 140 is 70, right? Because 140 divided by 2 is 70. So each child's fare is Rs. 70.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the total fare when there are 4 adults and 3 children. Hmm, so I need to calculate the total for the adults and the total for the children separately and then add them together.\n\nLet me calculate the adults first. Each adult is 140, and there are 4 of them. So 4 multiplied by 140. Let me do that math: 140 * 4. Well, 100*4 is 400, and 40*4 is 160. Adding them together, 400 + 160 is 560. So the adults' total is Rs. 560.\n\nNext, the children. Each child is 70, and there are 3. So 70 * 3. That's 210. So the children's total is Rs. 210.\n\nNow, add both totals together. 560 (adults) + 210 (children) equals... let's see. 560 plus 200 is 760, and then plus 10 more is 770. Wait, that can't be right. Because looking at the options, E is 770. But wait, I should double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, wait. Did I do that right? 4 adults at 140: 140 *4. Let me compute it again. 140 *4: 100*4=400, 40*4=160, 0*4=0. So 400+160=560. That's correct.\n\nFor the children: 3 *70 is 210. That's right. So adding 560 and 210 gives 770. Hmm, but looking at the options, option E is 770. But I remember sometimes there are options that might be close, but I should make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, another thought: sometimes in such problems, the child's fare is only for a certain distance or maybe a discount applies. But the question says the child's fare is half the adult fare between the same places, so I think it's straightforward. No, the calculation seems correct.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option E is 770, which matches. But wait, the options are A)666, B)670, C)700, D)570, E)770. So 770 is an option. So the correct answer would be E.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I read the question correctly? Because sometimes the fare might be one way, but maybe the trip is return, but the question says 'between the same places' which implies one way. So the calculation should be correct.\n\nWait, but another thing: sometimes the problem might be asking for per person or something else. But the problem says 4 adults and 3 children. So 4*140 + 3*70 = 560 +210=770. So yes, E is the answer.\n",

Right, so I should calculate the total for adults and then the total for children and add them together.\n\nLet me compute the adults first. There are 4 adults, each paying 140. So 4 multiplied by 140. Hmm, 4 times 140 is... let's see, 140 plus 140 is 280, times two more times that. So 280 plus 280 is 560. So the total for adults is Rs. 560.\n\nNext, the children. There are 3 children, each paying half the adult fare, which is 70. So 3 times 70. That's 210. So the children's total is 210.\n\nNow, adding both totals together: 560 plus 210.
