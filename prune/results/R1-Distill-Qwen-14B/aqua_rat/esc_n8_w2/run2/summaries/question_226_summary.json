      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so Peter needs to form a scavenger hunt team, and he wants 10 additional people. Wait, let me make sure I understand the question correctly. He's looking for 10 more people to join his team, and he has 10 friends who are willing to participate. Hmm, so Peter is the leader or the initial member, and he's seeking 10 others. But wait, the question is about how many choices he has. \n\nWait, maybe I should break this down. So Peter has 10 friends who are interested. He needs 10 more people. Does that mean he needs a total of 10 people besides himself, making the team size 11 including him? Or does he already have some people and just needs 10 more? Oh, the question says he wants to find 10 additional, so he's starting from himself. So the team will have Peter plus 10 others. That makes 11 people in total.\n\nBut the problem is phrased as, \"he has 10 friends who would like to participate.\" So Peter's 10 friends are available to join. So he needs 10 more people, but he only has 10 friends to choose from. So how many ways can he select 10 people out of his 10 friends? Because he needs exactly 10, and he has exactly 10 friends available.\n\nWait, this sounds like a combinations problem. The number of ways to choose 10 people from 10 is given by the combination formula, which is n choose k, where n is the total number, and k is the number to choose. So n is 10, k is 10. The formula is 10!/(10!*(10-10)! ), which simplifies to 10!/(10! * 0! ). Oh, wait, and 0! is 1. So this becomes 10!/(10! *1 ) = 1. So there's only one way to choose all 10 friends. So the number of choices is 1.\n\nBut wait, another angle: maybe Peter is already part of the team and he's looking for 10 more people. If he has 10 friends, he can choose all 10, so the number of possible teams is 1. So the correct answer is 1, which is option B.\n\nWait, but another thought: sometimes, when someone is forming a team, they might not have to include all possible friends. But in this case, Peter needs exactly 10 additional people, and he has exactly 10 friends. So he must choose all of them. So only one possible combination. So the answer must be option B.\n",

Oh right, Peter is looking to find 10 additional people. So including himself, the team would be 11 people? Or is he the one forming the team with 10 others? Hmm, the question says he wants 10 additional people, so I think that's 10 people besides himself.
