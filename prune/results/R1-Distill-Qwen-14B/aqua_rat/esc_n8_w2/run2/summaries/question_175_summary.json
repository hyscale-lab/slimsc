      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about cutting a rope into two pieces. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The rope is 20 meters long and it's cut into two pieces. One piece is 3 meters shorter than the other. I need to find the length of the longer piece. Hmm.\n\nAlright, let's think about how to approach this. It's a problem involving two pieces with a certain length difference. I remember from algebra that when you have two variables related by a difference, you can set up equations based on the total and the difference.\n\nWait, so if I let the longer piece be, say, x meters, then the shorter piece would be x minus 3 meters, because it's 3 meters shorter. Right? Because if the longer is x, the shorter is x-3.\n\nBut wait, the total length is 20 meters. So the sum of the two pieces should be 20. So x (longer) plus (x-3) (shorter) equals 20. Let me write that down as an equation.\n\nx + (x - 3) = 20\n\nLet me simplify this. Combine the x terms: x + x is 2x. So 2x -3 =20. Then I can add 3 to both sides to get 2x = 23. Oh wait, 20 plus 3 is 23. So 2x=23, so x is 23 divided by 2. What's 23 divided by 2? That's 11.5. So the longer piece is 11.5 meters.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that. If the longer piece is 11.5, the shorter would be 11.5-3=8.5. Then, 11.5 plus 8.5 equals 20. Yes, that adds up right. 11.5+8.5 is 20. So that makes sense.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 11.5. So that's the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my setup. Sometimes when I'm setting up equations, I can get the variables mixed up. Did I correctly assign x as the longer piece? Yes, because I let x be the longer one, so the other is x-3. So the setup is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is: the total difference between the two pieces is 3 meters. The total length is 20. So when you have two numbers with a difference and a sum, you can find them by adding and subtracting.\n\nAlternatively, think of the two pieces as being the same length, which would be 10 meters each. But since one is 3 meters shorter, you have to redistribute that 3 meters. So if one is 3 meters shorter, the other must be 3 meters longer than 10. So 10+1.5=11.5 and 10-1.5=8.5. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, because the difference is 3 meters. So if they were both 10, and one is 3 meters longer, the longer would be 11.5, the shorter 8.5. Oh wait, wait, no, that doesn't add up. 11.5 plus 8.5 is 20, yes. But wait, how did I get 1.5?\n\nHmm, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me think: the two pieces have a difference of 3. The sum is 20. So the longer is (sum + difference)/2. Because when you have two numbers with a sum S and difference D, the larger number is (S+D)/2.\n\nSo S is 20, D is 3. So (20 +3)/2 =23/2=11.5. Yes, that's correct. So that's another way to think about it.\n\nSo I'm confident that the longer piece is 11.5 meters. Looking at the options, D is 11.5. So the answer is D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, let the length of the longer piece be \\( x \\) meters.
