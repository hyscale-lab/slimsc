      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: A salesperson gets a 10% commission on each sale he makes. How many sales of $250 each must he make to reach a salary of at least $1000? The options are A)15, B)24, C)25, D)40, E)52.\n\nHmm, right. So the salesperson's earnings are based on commission. Commission is a percentage of each sale. So for each sale, he gets 10% of that sale amount.\n\nWait, each sale is $250. So for each sale, his commission is 10% of 250. Let me calculate that. 10% of 250 is... well, 0.10 * 250 equals 25. So he makes $25 per sale.\n\nHe wants his salary to be at least $1000. So I need to find how many sales (let's call it 'n') he needs to make so that 25 times n is equal to or greater than 1000.\n\nSo the equation would be: 25n \u2265 1000.\n\nTo find n, I'll divide both sides by 25. So n \u2265 1000 / 25. Let me do that division: 1000 divided by 25. Hmm, 25 times 40 is 1000, right? So n \u2265 40.\n\nWait, but let me check. 25 times 40 is indeed 1000. So if he makes 40 sales, he gets exactly $1000. But the question says \"at least $1000,\" which means 40 sales would be the minimum needed.\n\nLooking at the options, D is 40. So the answer should be D.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I missed something. Each sale is $250, 10% of that is $25. 40 sales would be 40 * 25 = 1000. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAnother way: 10% is 0.1. Each sale is 0.1 * 250 = 25. So to get 1000, 1000 / 25 = 40. Yep, same result.\n\nSo the correct answer is D)40.\n",

Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the salesperson earns 10% commission on each sale. Each sale is $250. So for each sale, the commission would be 10% of $250. Wait, how do I calculate that? Oh right, 10% is the same as 0.10 in decimal. So 0.10 multiplied by 250.\n\nLet me compute that: 0.10 * 250 = 25. So each sale gives him $25 commission.\n\nNow, he needs at least $1000 in total. So how many times does $25 go into $1000? I think I can set up an equation for this. Let me denote the number of sales as 'n'. So, each sale gives $25, so total commission is 25 * n.\n\nHe needs 25n >= 1000. Because he needs at least $1000.\n\nWait, why is it >=? Oh right, because \"at least\" means equal to or more than. So solving for n: 25n >= 1000.\n\nDivide both sides by 25. So n >= 1000 / 25. Let me compute that: 1000 divided by 25 is 40. Because 25 times 40 is 1000.\n\nWait, but wait a second. If he makes exactly 40 sales, that gives him exactly $1000. But the question says \"at least\" $1000. So 40 sales would be the minimum number needed. But wait, let me check the options. Option D is 40. So that's one of the choices.\n\nWait, but looking back, maybe I made a mistake. Because each sale is $250, and 10% is $25 per sale. So 40 sales would give 40 * 25 = 1000. So that's correct. So the answer should be 40, which is option D.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Let me see if I interpreted the question correctly. The commission is 10% per sale, each sale is $250. So yes, each sale gives $25.\n\nSo, 40 sales would be needed. So the correct answer is D)40.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Another way to think: If each sale is 250, and he sells one, he gets 25. So to get 1000, how many 25s? 1000/25 is 40. Yep. So that's correct.\n",
