      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Fernando and his meal plan. Let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem says he bought a meal plan that allows him 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. But wait, the cafeteria is closed on weekends. Oh right, so that means he can't eat at the cafeteria on Saturday and Sunday. And also, he always goes home for dinner on Friday nights. Hmm, so that affects how he uses his meals.\n\nWait, let me think about the days. The week has seven days, but since the cafeteria is closed on weekends, that leaves Monday to Friday as the days he can eat there. So five days in total: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. \n\nBut wait, on Friday nights he goes home for dinner. So does that mean he doesn't eat at the cafeteria on Friday night? Oh, right! Because he goes home, he can't use his dinner meal at the cafeteria that night. So for dinner, he can only use the cafeteria on Monday to Thursday nights. That's four days for dinners.\n\nSo for lunches, the cafeteria is open on all five days (Mon-Fri), so he can have lunch there on any of those days. He has three lunch meals to allocate. So the number of ways to choose three days out of five for lunch is the combination of 5 choose 3, which is 5C3.\n\nNow for dinners: he can't use Friday night because he's going home. So he can only use the four days from Monday to Thursday for dinners. And he has three dinners to allocate. So the number of ways is 4C3.\n\nSo the total number of options is the product of these two combinations. So it's 5C3 multiplied by 4C3. Let me look at the options.\n\nOption A is 5C3 *4C3. That looks right. But wait, let me check the other options to be sure.\n\nOption B is 5C4 *4C2. Hmm, that would be if he was choosing four days for something else, which doesn't fit.\n\nOption C is 5C2 *4C4. That's choosing two days for lunch and all four for dinner, which doesn't match because he needs three each.\n\nOption D seems way off, like 5C6 which is impossible since you can't choose 6 items from 5. So that's invalid.\n\nOption E is 4C3 *4C3. Wait, that would be if both lunch and dinner were only four days each, but lunch can be five days.\n\nSo yes, option A is the correct one. The total options are 5C3 multiplied by 4C3.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Fernando and his meal plan. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, okay, the question is about figuring out how many options he has to allocate his meals. \n\nSo, the setup is that he bought a meal plan allowing 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. The cafeteria is closed on weekends, so I guess that means he can't eat there on Saturday and Sunday. Oh, right, and he always goes home for dinner on Friday nights. So that probably means he doesn't eat at the cafeteria on Friday dinner, right? \n\nWait, so let me think about the days. A week has 7 days: Monday to Sunday. But the cafeteria is closed on weekends, so only Monday to Friday are open. So he can eat at the cafeteria only from Monday to Friday. \n\nHe has 3 lunch meals and 3 dinner meals. Each day he can have either lunch or dinner, but wait, no\u2014lunch and dinner are separate. So he needs to use 3 lunches and 3 dinners. \n\nWait, but the problem is about how he allocates his meals. So each day he can have a lunch or a dinner, but he has a limited number of each. \n\nWait no, maybe not. Wait, the meal plan is 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. So he can eat any combination of those, but each day, he can have a meal, either lunch or dinner, as long as he doesn't exceed 3 of each. Or wait, perhaps it's that he has 3 lunch slots and 3 dinner slots. So he has to choose 3 days for lunch and 3 days for dinner, but considering the days the cafeteria is open.\n\nWait, but the problem says the cafeteria is closed on weekends, so he can't eat there on Saturday or Sunday. So he can only go from Monday to Friday. So that's 5 days. \n\nBut he needs to choose 3 days for lunch and 3 days for dinner. Wait, but that's 6 days, but there are only 5 days available (Mon-Fri). So that's a problem, because 3 + 3 =6, but only 5 days are available. \n\nAh, but wait, he can have both lunch and dinner on the same day, right? Because the problem says he has a total of 3 lunches and 3 dinners. So each day he can have a lunch and/or a dinner. But wait, but the meal plan is per week, so each day can have both, I think. Because otherwise, the numbers wouldn't add up. \n\nWait, no, perhaps not. Wait, let's think again. He has 3 lunch meals and 3 dinner meals. Each day, he can have a lunch and a dinner, but he can't exceed 3 of each. But wait, the problem is about allocating his meals, meaning assigning which days he uses his lunch and dinner meals.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is about selecting which days he'll have lunch and which days he'll have dinner. But he can't use more than 3 lunches and 3 dinners in total. But wait, the days available are Monday to Friday. So, perhaps he needs to choose 3 days for lunch and 3 days for dinner from the 5 available days. But wait, that's 6 days in total, but only 5 are available. So that's impossible because 3 +3 =6, but only 5 days. \n\nWait, but perhaps he can have both lunch and dinner on the same day. Because the problem says he has 3 of each. So maybe each day he can have a lunch and a dinner. So for example, he can have lunch on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and dinners on Monday, Thursday, Friday. But wait, no, because he can't go on Saturday and Sunday. \n\nWait, no, let me read the problem again. \"Fernando purchased a university meal plan that allows him to have a total of 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week.\" So he can have up to 3 lunches and up to 3 dinners, but he might have some days without a meal. Or perhaps he uses all of them. The problem says 'a total of', so perhaps he must use all 3 lunches and 3 dinners. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for how many options he has to allocate his meals. So he has to assign each of the 3 lunches and 3 dinners to specific days. \n\nBut the days available are Monday to Friday, as the cafeteria is closed on weekends. So he can only use those days. Also, he goes home for dinner on Friday nights. So he can't have dinner on Friday. Wait, that's a key point. So he can't have a dinner on Friday, because he goes home. So for dinners, he can only choose from Monday to Thursday. \n\nWait, so for lunch, he can choose any of the 5 days (Mon-Fri), but for dinner, he can only choose from Mon-Thu, because Friday is excluded. \n\nSo he needs to allocate 3 lunches across 5 days (Mon-Fri) and 3 dinners across 4 days (Mon-Thu). \n\nSo the problem becomes: how many ways can he choose 3 days out of 5 for lunch, and 3 days out of 4 for dinner. \n\nBut wait, each meal is a separate choice. So the number of ways is the number of combinations for lunch multiplied by the combinations for dinner. \n\nSo for lunch: 5 choose 3 (since 5 days, choose 3 for lunch). For dinner: 4 choose 3 (4 days, choose 3 for dinner). So the total options are 5C3 multiplied by 4C3. \n\nLooking at the options, option A is 5C3 *4C3. So the answer should be A. \n\nWait, let me double-check. Are there any constraints I'm missing? Like, can he have both lunch and dinner on the same day? Because if he can, then the total number of days used could be less than 6. But wait, the problem says he has 3 lunches and 3 dinners. So each meal is a separate allocation. So he can have a lunch on a day and a dinner on the same day, but each is a separate count. \n\nWait, but the problem is about allocating the meals, not about the days. So each lunch is assigned to a day, each dinner to another day. So the days can overlap. So for example, he might have lunch on Monday and dinner on Monday as well. That's allowed. \n\nSo the allocations are independent. So the number of ways is (number of ways to choose 3 days for lunch) multiplied by (number of ways to choose 3 days for dinner). \n\nSo lunch: 5C3, dinner:4C3. So yes, option A is correct. \n\nI think that's it. So the correct answer is option A.\n",
