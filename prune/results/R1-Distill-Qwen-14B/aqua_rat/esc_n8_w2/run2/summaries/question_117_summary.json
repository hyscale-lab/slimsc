      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this business problem here. Let me read through it carefully and try to figure it out step by step. \n\nSo, the problem is about three people\u2014A, B, and C\u2014who start a business together, each contributing different amounts at different times. The goal is to find out after how many months C joined the business after B. \n\nAlright, let's break it down. \n\nFirst, A starts the business with Rs.40,000. That's straightforward. Then, after 2 months, B joins with Rs.60,000. So B's investment comes in when the business is already two months old. \n\nThen, C joins after some more time with Rs.120,000. So the order is A starts, then B after 2 months, then C after some additional time. \n\nThe total time is a year, so 12 months. So the timeline goes A for x months, then B for y months, and then C for z months. But wait, the question is about how many months after B joined did C join. So if B joined after 2 months, and C joined after that, say, m months later, then the total time each person has invested would be:\n\n- A: 12 months (since he started first)\n- B: (12 - 2) months? Wait, no. Wait, the way it's worded, A starts, then B joins after 2 months, then C joins after some more time. So the total time for each:\n\nA is in the business for the entire year, so 12 months.\n\nB joins after 2 months, so he's in for 12 - 2 = 10 months.\n\nC joins after some more time. Let's say B joined at month 2, then C joined after m months from B's joining. So C's time in the business would be 12 - (2 + m) months. \n\nWait, but the total time is a year, so 12 months. So C's investment period is (12 - (2 + m)) months. \n\nWait, maybe I should model it as:\n\n- A invests for 12 months.\n- B invests for (12 - 2) = 10 months.\n- C invests for (12 - (2 + m)) months, where m is the months after B joined that C came in.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the time each person's investment was present in the business. So, for example, A was there the whole time, B was there for 10 months, and C was there for (12 - (2 + m)) months, where m is the number of months after B that C joined. So if m is 4, then C joined 4 months after B, which would be 6 months into the business. So C's investment time is 12 -6 =6 months. \n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if that's the right way to model it. Let's think in terms of the periods each person's money was in the business. \n\nSo, the profit is divided based on the product of the capital invested and the time for which it was invested. So each person's share is (capital \u00d7 time). \n\nThe total profit is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000 of that. So, the profit is split according to their investments and the time they were in the business. \n\nLet me denote the time each person's capital was in the business as:\n\n- A: 12 months\n- B: (12 - 2) =10 months\n- C: (12 - (2 + m)) months, where m is the number of months after B joined that C joined.\n\nWait, but m is the time after B joined. So if B joined at month 2, and C joined m months later, then C's investment period is (12 - (2 + m)) months. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should let t be the number of months after B joined that C joined. So, for example, if t=4, then C joined 4 months after B, which is at month 2+4=6. So C's investment period is 12 -6 =6 months. \n\nSo, each person's contribution is:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12\n\nB: 60,000 * (12 -2) = 60,000 *10\n\nC:120,000 * (12 -2 -t) =120,000*(10 -t)\n\nWait, no, because if B joined at 2 months, then C joins t months after B, so C's joining time is 2 + t months. Therefore, the time C's capital is in the business is 12 - (2 + t) =10 -t months.\n\nSo their contributions are:\n\nA: 40000 *12\n\nB:60000 * (10) \n\nC:120000 * (10 -t)\n\nWait, but that's only if t is the time after B joined. So the time each person's money is in is:\n\nA: 12 months\n\nB: 10 months\n\nC: (12 - (2 + t)) =10 -t months.\n\nSo the profit is divided in the ratio of (A's contribution) : (B's contribution) : (C's contribution) = 40000*12 : 60000*10 : 120000*(10-t).\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nA : B : C = (40000 *12) : (60000 *10) : (120000*(10-t)).\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nA: 40000*12 =480000\n\nB:60000 *10 =600000\n\nC:120000*(10-t) =1200000 -120000 t\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to factor out common terms. Let me see:\n\nWe can divide each term by 10000 to make it easier.\n\nSo:\n\nA: 48\n\nB:60\n\nC:12*(10 -t) =120 -12t\n\nSo the ratio is 48 :60 : (120 -12t)\n\nWe can simplify this ratio further by dividing each term by 12:\n\n48/12=4\n\n60/12=5\n\n(120-12t)/12=10 -t\n\nSo the simplified ratio is 4 :5 : (10 - t)\n\nWait, that seems manageable.\n\nNow, the total profit is 375,000, and C gets 150,000. So, the profit is divided according to the ratio.\n\nSo, the total parts of the ratio are 4 +5 + (10 -t) = 19 -t.\n\nWait, let's compute that:\n\n4 +5=9\n\n9 + (10 -t) =19 - t.\n\nSo the total parts are (19 -t). \n\nThe total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. \n\nIn the ratio, C's share is (10 - t) parts. So, each part is equal to 375000 / (19 -t). \n\nC's share is (10 - t) * (375000/(19 -t)) )=150000.\n\nSo:\n\n(10 -t) * (375000) / (19 -t) ) =150000.\n\nLet me write that equation:\n\n(10 - t) * 375000 = 150000 * (19 - t)\n\nLet me compute both sides.\n\nLeft side: 375000*(10 -t)\n\nRight side:150000*(19 -t)\n\nWe can divide both sides by 150000 to simplify:\n\n(375000/150000) * (10 -t) = (19 -t)\n\n375000 /150000 is 2.5.\n\nSo 2.5*(10 -t) =19 -t\n\nMultiply both sides by 10 to eliminate decimal:\n\n25*(10 -t) =10*(19 -t)\n\n250 -25t =190 -10t\n\nBring like terms together:\n\n250 -190 =25t -10t\n\n60 =15t\n\nt=60/15=4.\n\nSo t is 4 months.\n\nWait, but t is the number of months after B joined that C joined. So B joined at month 2, then C joined 4 months after that, which is at month 2+4=6. So C joined 4 months after B.\n\nSo the correct answer is 4 months. Looking at the options, option B is 4 months.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me recompute the equation:\n\n(10 -t) *375000 =150000*(19 -t)\n\nDivide both sides by 150000:\n\n(10-t)*2.5 =19 -t\n\nMultiply out left side:\n\n25 -2.5t =19 -t\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n25-19 =2.5t -t\n\n6=1.5t\n\nt=4. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer is 4 months, which is option B.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this business problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about partners in a business and their profit shares based on the time they've invested. \n\nAlright, so let's parse the problem. A starts a business with Rs.40,000. After two months, B joins with Rs.60,000. Then, some time after that, C joins with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000. We need to find out how many months after B joined did C join the business.\n\nWait, so the time each person is in the business affects their share. Profit is divided based on the product of capital and time, right? Because each partner's contribution is for a certain period, so their share is proportional to their investment multiplied by the time they were in the business.\n\nLet me structure this. Let's denote the time each person was in the business as follows:\n\n- A started first. Since the total time is a year (12 months), and B joined after 2 months, A's time is 12 months.\n\n- B joined after 2 months, so he's been there for (12 - 2) = 10 months. But wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says C joined after some more time after B. So the time C joined after B is what we're trying to find. Let's call that time 'x' months. So C was in the business for (12 - 2 - x) months? No, wait, no. Because the total time is 12 months. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the timeline is:\n\n- A starts at month 0.\n\n- B joins after 2 months (so month 2).\n\n- C joins after some more months after B. So the time between B joining and C joining is 'x' months. So C joins at month (2 + x). Therefore, the time C is in the business is (12 - (2 + x)) = 10 - x months.\n\nWait, no. Because the year is 12 months. So if C joins at month (2 + x), then he is in the business for (12 - (2 + x)) months. So 10 - x months? Wait, that can't be right because if x is the time after B, then C's time is (12 - (2 + x)) = 10 - x. But if x is, say, 2 months, then C is in for 8 months. But the problem says that C's share is 150,000 out of 375,000. So let's think about the ratios.\n\nWait, the profit is divided based on the product of capital and time. So each partner's share is (capital * time) / total capital-time.\n\nSo the ratio of their shares should be equal to the ratio of (capital * time) for each.\n\nSo let's calculate the capital-time for each:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000.\n\nB: 60,000 * (12 - 2) = 60,000 * 10 = 600,000.\n\nWait, wait, no. Because B joined after 2 months, so he was there for 10 months. So that's correct.\n\nC: 120,000 * t, where t is the time C was in the business.\n\nWait, but when did C join? After B, so if B joined at month 2, and C joined 'x' months after that, so C joined at month (2 + x). So the time C is in is (12 - (2 + x)) = 10 - x months. So t = 10 - x.\n\nSo C's capital-time is 120,000 * (10 - x).\n\nNow, the total profit is 375,000, and C gets 150,000. So C's share is 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4 or 40% of the profit. So his ratio should be 40% of the total capital-time.\n\nWait, no. Because the profit is divided in the ratio of their capital-time. So the ratio of their shares is the same as the ratio of their (capital * time). So the sum of all capital-time is the denominator, and each person's capital-time is their numerator.\n\nSo the total capital-time is A's + B's + C's.\n\nWhich is 480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(10 -x) = 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000 x = 2,280,000 - 120,000 x.\n\nWait, no, 480,000 + 600,000 is 1,080,000. Then 120,000*(10 -x) is 1,200,000 - 120,000 x. So total is 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 -120,000 x = 2,280,000 - 120,000 x.\n\nC's share is (120,000*(10 -x)) / (total capital-time) = 150,000 / 375,000.\n\nWait, 150,000 is C's share, so the ratio is 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4.\n\nSo,\n\n(120,000*(10 -x)) / (2,280,000 - 120,000 x) = 0.4\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n(120,000*(10 -x)) = 0.4*(2,280,000 - 120,000 x)\n\nLet me compute the right-hand side:\n\n0.4 * 2,280,000 = 912,000.\n\n0.4 * (-120,000 x) = -48,000 x.\n\nSo right-hand side is 912,000 -48,000 x.\n\nLeft-hand side is 1,200,000 - 120,000 x.\n\nSo equation:\n\n1,200,000 - 120,000 x = 912,000 -48,000 x\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side.\n\n1,200,000 -912,000 = 120,000 x -48,000 x\n\n288,000 = 72,000 x\n\nSo x = 288,000 /72,000 = 4.\n\nWait, so x is 4 months.\n\nSo C joined 4 months after B joined. So the correct option is B)4 months.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me compute the capital-time for each.\n\nIf x is 4 months, then:\n\nC joined 2 +4 =6 months after A started. So he was in the business for 12-6=6 months.\n\nSo C's capital-time is 120,000 *6=720,000.\n\nA's is 40,000 *12=480,000.\n\nB's is 60,000 *10=600,000.\n\nTotal capital-time: 480,000 +600,000 +720,000 =1,800,000.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated it, I had 2,280,000 -120,000 x. Plugging x=4, that would be 2,280,000 -480,000=1,800,000. Correct.\n\nSo C's share is (720,000)/1,800,000=0.4, which is 40% of 375,000, which is 150,000. That matches. So yes, x=4 is correct.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this business problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about partners in a business and their profit shares based on the time they've invested. \n\nAlright, so let's parse the problem. A starts a business with Rs.40,000. After two months, B joins with Rs.60,000. Then, some time after that, C joins with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000. We need to find out how many months after B joined did C join the business.\n\nWait, so the time each person is in the business affects their share. Profit is divided based on the product of capital and time, right? Because each partner's contribution is for a certain period, so their share is proportional to their investment multiplied by the time they were in the business.\n\nLet me structure this. Let's denote the time each person was in the business as follows:\n\n- A started first. Since the total time is a year (12 months), and B joined after 2 months, A's time is 12 months.\n\n- B joined after 2 months, so he's been there for (12 - 2) = 10 months. But wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says C joined after some more time after B. So the time C joined after B is what we're trying to find. Let's call that time 'x' months. So C was in the business for (12 - 2 - x) months? No, wait, no. Because the total time is 12 months. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the timeline is:\n\n- A starts at month 0.\n\n- B joins after 2 months (so month 2).\n\n- C joins after some more months after B. So the time between B joining and C joining is 'x' months. So C joins at month (2 + x). Therefore, the time C is in the business is (12 - (2 + x)) = 10 - x months.\n\nWait, no. Because the year is 12 months. So if C joins at month (2 + x), then he is in the business for (12 - (2 + x)) months. So 10 - x months? Wait, that can't be right because if x is the time after B, then C's time is (12 - (2 + x)) = 10 - x. But if x is, say, 2 months, then C is in for 8 months. But the problem says that C's share is 150,000 out of 375,000. So let's think about the ratios.\n\nWait, the profit is divided based on the product of capital and time. So each partner's share is (capital * time) / total capital-time.\n\nSo the ratio of their shares should be equal to the ratio of (capital * time) for each.\n\nSo let's calculate the capital-time for each:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000.\n\nB: 60,000 * (12 - 2) = 60,000 * 10 = 600,000.\n\nWait, wait, no. Because B joined after 2 months, so he was there for 10 months. So that's correct.\n\nC: 120,000 * t, where t is the time C was in the business.\n\nWait, but when did C join? After B, so if B joined at month 2, and C joined 'x' months after that, so C joined at month (2 + x). So the time C is in is (12 - (2 + x)) = 10 - x months. So t = 10 - x.\n\nSo C's capital-time is 120,000 * (10 - x).\n\nNow, the total profit is 375,000, and C gets 150,000. So C's share is 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4 or 40% of the profit. So his ratio should be 40% of the total capital-time.\n\nWait, no. Because the profit is divided in the ratio of their capital-time. So the ratio of their shares is the same as the ratio of their (capital * time). So the sum of all capital-time is the denominator, and each person's capital-time is their numerator.\n\nSo the total capital-time is A's + B's + C's.\n\nWhich is 480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(10 -x) = 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000 x = 2,280,000 - 120,000 x.\n\nWait, no, 480,000 + 600,000 is 1,080,000. Then 120,000*(10 -x) is 1,200,000 - 120,000 x. So total is 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 -120,000 x = 2,280,000 - 120,000 x.\n\nC's share is (120,000*(10 -x)) / (total capital-time) = 150,000 / 375,000.\n\nWait, 150,000 is C's share, so the ratio is 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4.\n\nSo,\n\n(120,000*(10 -x)) / (2,280,000 - 120,000 x) = 0.4\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n(120,000*(10 -x)) = 0.4*(2,280,000 - 120,000 x)\n\nLet me compute the right-hand side:\n\n0.4 * 2,280,000 = 912,000.\n\n0.4 * (-120,000 x) = -48,000 x.\n\nSo right-hand side is 912,000 -48,000 x.\n\nLeft-hand side is 1,200,000 - 120,000 x.\n\nSo equation:\n\n1,200,000 - 120,000 x = 912,000 -48,000 x\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side.\n\n1,200,000 -912,000 = 120,000 x -48,000 x\n\n288,000 = 72,000 x\n\nSo x = 288,000 /72,000 = 4.\n\nWait, so x is 4 months.\n\nSo C joined 4 months after B joined. So the correct option is B)4 months.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me compute the capital-time for each.\n\nIf x is 4 months, then:\n\nC joined 2 +4 =6 months after A started. So he was in the business for 12-6=6 months.\n\nSo C's capital-time is 120,000 *6=720,000.\n\nA's is 40,000 *12=480,000.\n\nB's is 60,000 *10=600,000.\n\nTotal capital-time: 480,000 +600,000 +720,000 =1,800,000.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated it, I had 2,280,000 -120,000 x. Plugging x=4, that would be 2,280,000 -480,000=1,800,000. Correct.\n\nSo C's share is (720,000)/1,800,000=0.4, which is 40% of 375,000, which is 150,000. That matches.
