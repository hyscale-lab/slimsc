      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to solve this problem. So, the question is about calculating the monthly sales needed for a shop assistant's salary to reach $1500. Hmm, I remember that her salary has two parts: a fixed amount and a percentage of sales. Let me break it down.\n\nThe fixed salary is $500. Then, she gets 5% of all monthly sales added to that. So her total salary S is 500 plus 5% of sales. The goal is to find out what sales figure makes her salary $1500.\n\nWait, let me write that out as an equation. S = 500 + 0.05 * sales. Oh right, because 5% is 0.05 in decimal.\n\nWe know that S needs to be $1500. So plugging that in, 1500 = 500 + 0.05 * sales. Hmm, I think I can solve for sales.\n\nLet me subtract 500 from both sides. 1500 minus 500 is 1000, so 1000 = 0.05 * sales. Now I need to find sales, which is the total sales. So I can divide both sides by 0.05.\n\nWait, 1000 divided by 0.05. Let me calculate that. 1000 divided by 0.05 is the same as 1000 multiplied by 20, right? Because 1/0.05 is 20. So 1000 * 20 equals 20,000. Oh, so the sales should be $20,000.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is $20000. So that's the right answer. Wait, but let me double-check. If sales are $20,000, 5% is 1000. Add that to 500, you get 1500. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be D.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a shop assistant's salary. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step. Hmm, the question says that her monthly salary S is made up of a fixed part and a commission from sales. \n\nSo the formula given is S = 500 + 5% of all monthly sales. Right, so the fixed part is $500, and then she gets 5% of whatever she sells each month. The goal is to find out how much she needs to sell so that her total salary is $1500. \n\nWait, so I need to solve for the sales amount, which I'll call, say, X. Because the salary depends on X. Let me write that down.\n\nThe equation is: S = 500 + 0.05 * X.\n\nBut we want S to be 1500. So plugging that in, we get 1500 = 500 + 0.05X. \n\nHmm, okay, subtract 500 from both sides to get the variable part. So 1500 - 500 is 1000. That means 1000 equals 0.05 times X. \n\nWait, 0.05 is the same as 5%, right? So 1000 = 0.05X. To find X, I need to divide both sides by 0.05. \n\nLet me do that. 1000 divided by 0.05. Hmm, 0.05 is a fifth of a dollar, or 5 cents. So dividing by 0.05 is the same as multiplying by 20, because 1/0.05 is 20. \n\nSo 1000 * 20 is 20,000. So X is $20,000. \n\nWait, let me double-check. If her sales are $20,000, then 5% of that is 1000. Adding the fixed 500, that gives 1500. Yep, that's correct. \n\nLooking at the options, option D is $20,000. So that should be the right answer. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The math seems straightforward. Let me just think again: 5% of 20k is 1k. 1k plus 500 is 1500. Yep, that works.\n",
