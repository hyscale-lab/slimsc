      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find a 5-digit number with a specific property. The property is that if you add a 1 after the number, it becomes three times as large as when you add a 1 before the number. Hmm, that's a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.\n\nLet me denote the 5-digit number as N. So, N is a 5-digit number. Now, when I put a 1 after N, that's like appending 1 to the end. So, if N was, say, abcde, putting a 1 after makes it abcde1, which is a 6-digit number. Similarly, putting a 1 before would make it 1abcde, another 6-digit number.\n\nThe problem states that the number after adding 1 at the end is three times the number after adding 1 at the beginning. So, mathematically, I can write that as:\n\nN * 10 + 1 = 3 * (100000 + N)\n\nWait, why 100000? Oh right, because adding a 1 before a 5-digit number increases its value by 100000 (since the 1 is in the hundred thousands place). So, the equation is:\n\n10*N + 1 = 3*(100000 + N)\n\nLet me solve this equation step by step. Expanding the right side: 3*100000 is 300000, and 3*N is 3N. So, the equation becomes:\n\n10N + 1 = 300000 + 3N\n\nSubtract 3N from both sides:\n\n7N + 1 = 300000\n\nSubtract 1:\n\n7N = 299999\n\nSo, N = 299999 / 7. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 7 times what gives me 299999. Let's see, 7 * 42857 is 299,999. Because 42857 * 7: 42857 *7, 7*7=49, carryover 4. 5*7=35+4=39, carryover 3. 8*7=56+3=59, carryover 5. 2*7=14+5=19, carryover 1. 4*7=28+1=29. So, 299,999. So N is 42857.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the options. Option A is 42857. So that's the candidate. Let me verify the condition.\n\nPutting a 1 after: 428571. Putting a 1 before: 142857. Now, 142857 multiplied by 3 is 428571. Yes, because 142,857 *3 is 428,571. So that works.\n\nLet me just make sure none of the other options would work. For example, let's take option B, 32456. Appending 1 makes 324561. Putting 1 before gives 132456. 132456 *3 is 397,368, which is way less than 324561. So that doesn't fit.\n\nOption C: 76523. Adding 1 after: 765231. Adding 1 before: 176523. 176523 *3 is 529,569, which is bigger than 765231. No, wait, 529,569 is less than 765,231? No, 529,569 is about half a million, 765k is bigger. So 3 times is 529k, which is not equal to 765k. So no.\n\nOption D: 24567. Adding 1: 245671. Adding 1 before: 124567. 3*124567 is 373,701, which is less than 245,671? Wait, no, 373k is bigger than 245k. So that's not equal.\n\nOption E:43566. Adding 1: 435661. Adding 1 before:143566. 3*143566 is 430,698. Which is less than 435,661. So no.\n\nSo only option A satisfies the condition. So the answer is A)42857.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we denote the 5-digit number as \\( N \\). When a 1 is appended to the end of \\( N \\), the number becomes \\( 10N + 1 \\).
