Let me read it again.\n\nThe question is asking: What is the sum of three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727 + 728 + 729. The options are A)37, B)38, C)36, D)30, E)39.\n\nHmm, wait, wait. Wait, the product of three consecutive integers equals 727 + 728 + 729? Or does it mean that the sum of those three consecutive integers equals that sum? Wait, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again.\n\nIt says, \"the sum of three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727+728+729.\" Oh wait, no, that's not right. Let me read it again. No, the product can be expressed as the sum of 727, 728, and 729. Or is the product equal to that sum?\n\nWait, the way it's phrased: \"the product can be expressed as 727 + 728 + 729.\" So, the product of the three consecutive integers is equal to the sum of 727, 728, and 729. So, first, I need to calculate that sum, then find three consecutive integers whose product equals that sum. Then, find the sum of those three integers.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off because 727, 728, 729 are three consecutive numbers themselves. So their sum would be 3 times the middle number, right? Let's compute that first.\n\n727 + 728 is 1455, plus 729 is 1455 + 729. Let me add that. 1455 + 700 is 2155, plus 29 is 2184. So the product of the three consecutive integers is 2184.\n\nWait, so the product is 2184, and I need to find three consecutive integers whose product is 2184. Then, sum those three integers and choose the correct option.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding three consecutive integers a, a+1, a+2, such that a*(a+1)*(a+2) = 2184. Then, the sum would be a + (a+1) + (a+2) = 3a +3 = 3(a+1). So once I find a, the sum is easy.\n\nBut how do I find a? Let me think. Maybe I can take the cube root of 2184 to approximate where a might be. Because for consecutive numbers, the middle one is roughly the cube root of the product. Let me compute the cube root of 2184.\n\nWait, 12^3 is 1728, 13^3 is 2197. Oh! 13 cubed is 2197, which is just a bit larger than 2184. So, the middle number a+1 is probably 12 or 13.\n\nWait, let me calculate 12 *13 *14. Because if a=12, then the numbers are 12,13,14.\n\n12*13 = 156, 156*14. Let's compute that: 156*10=1560, 156*4=624. Sum is 1560+624=2184. Oh! That's exactly the product we're looking for.\n\nSo the three consecutive integers are 12,13,14. Their sum is 12+13+14 = 39. Wait, but looking at the options, E is 39. But wait, let me make sure.\n\nWait, but the options given are A)37, B)38, C)36, D)30, E)39. So E is 39. So the answer should be E.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations because I don't want to make a mistake. 12*13 is 156, then 156*14. 156*14: 156 * 10 is 1560, 156 *4 is 624. 1560 + 624 is 2184. Yes, correct.\n\nSo the sum is 12 +13 +14 = 39. So the answer is E)39.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't misread the question. It says the sum of three consecutive integers whose product is 727+728+729. Wait, no. The product is equal to 727+728+729. Because the question says \"whose product can be expressed as 727+728+729.\" So the product is 2184, as we have, and the three consecutive integers are 12,13,14, sum 39.\n\nSo yeah, the correct answer should be E)39.\n",

The options are A)37, B)38, C)36, D)30, E)39.\n\nHmm, wait. So, the product of three consecutive integers equals 727 +728 +729. Let me break this down. First, I need to calculate what 727 +728 +729 adds up to. Then, I'll have to find three consecutive integers whose product is equal to that sum. Once I find those integers, I'll add them together to get the answer.\n\nLet me start by adding those three numbers. 727 +728 is... let me compute that. 727 +728: 700+700 is 1400, 27+28 is 55. So 1400 +55 is 1455. Then add 729 to that. So 1455 +729. Let's see, 1455 +700 is 2155, plus 29 is 2184. Wait, no, wait: 1455 +729. Let me do it properly.\n\n729 is 700 + 29. So 1455 +700 is 2155, then 2155 +29 is 2184. So the sum is 2184. So the product of the three consecutive integers is 2184.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. The product of three consecutive integers is 2184. So I need to find three numbers, say n, n+1, n+2, such that n*(n+1)*(n+2) = 2184.\n\nOnce I find those numbers, I add them together to get the sum, which is n + (n+1) + (n+2) = 3n +3 = 3(n+1).

Wait, that would be negative, but 2184 is positive. So if n is negative, n+1 would be less negative, etc. Let me compute (-14)*(-13)*(-12). The product would be negative because it's an odd number of negatives. So that's -2184. So that's not equal to 2184.
