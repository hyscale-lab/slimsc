      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about two machines producing yo-yos, and I need to figure out after how many minutes they'll have produced a total of 10 yo-yos. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nHmm, Machine A produces a yo-yo every 6 minutes. So, in one minute, it makes 1/6 of a yo-yo. Similarly, Machine B makes one every 9 minutes, so that's 1/9 per minute. Wait, but maybe I don't need to convert them to rates. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate how many each machine makes over time and see when their combined total hits 10.\n\nWait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Are we looking for when the total number of yo-yos from both machines is 10, or when each has produced 10? I think it's the total from both. Because the way it's phrased, \"they have produced 10 yo-yos\" sounds like together.\n\nSo, I need to find the time 't' where the number of yo-yos from A plus those from B equals 10.\n\nLet me model this. The number of yo-yos from A in time t is t divided by 6, but since you can't have a fraction of a yo-yo, it's actually the floor of (t/6) + 1. Wait, no, because at exactly 6 minutes, it's produced one. So if t is 6, 6/6=1, so that's correct. Similarly, at 12 minutes, it's 2, etc. So the formula is (t // 6) for A, and (t // 9) for B. Then, the sum should be 10.\n\nWait, but wait. For example, at t=6, A has 1, B has 0. At t=9, A has 1 (6 minutes), B has 1 (9 minutes). So total is 2. At t=12, A has 2 (12/6=2), B has 1 (12/9=1.333, floor is 1). So 3 total. Hmm.\n\nSo I think the correct approach is to find the smallest t where (t//6) + (t//9) >=10.\n\nWait, but wait, the problem says \"after how many minutes will they have produced 10 yo-yos\". So it's when the combined total reaches exactly 10, but maybe it's the first time it's at least 10? Or exactly 10?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model it as the sum of the rates multiplied by time. So the combined rate is 1/6 + 1/9 yo-yos per minute.\n\nLet me calculate that: 1/6 is approximately 0.1667, 1/9 is about 0.1111. Together, that's about 0.2778 yo-yos per minute.\n\nSo to get 10 yo-yos, time would be 10 / (1/6 + 1/9) = 10 / (5/18) )= 10 * (18/5) = 36 minutes.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me check. Because sometimes when you model things as continuous rates, you can get an exact time, but in reality, the production happens at discrete intervals. So for example, if the time is 36 minutes, how many has each produced?\n\nMachine A: 36 /6 = 6. So 6 yo-yos.\n\nMachine B: 36/9=4. So 4 yo-yos. Total is 10. So that's exactly 10. So 36 minutes would be the time.\n\nWait, but let me check the options. Option C is 36, which is one of the choices. So that's probably the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: let's list the number of yo-yos each machine produces at various times.\n\nFor Machine A (every 6 min):\n\nAt 6: 1\n\n12: 2\n\n18:3\n\n24:4\n\n30:5\n\n36:6\n\n42:7\n\n48:8 etc.\n\nFor Machine B (every 9 min):\n\nAt 9:1\n\n18:2\n\n27:3\n\n36:4\n\n45:5\n\n54:6 etc.\n\nNow, let's track the cumulative total over time.\n\nTime: 0 \u2192 A:0, B:0 \u2192 Total:0\n\n6 \u2192 A:1, B:0 \u2192 1\n\n9 \u2192 A:1, B:1 \u2192 2\n\n12 \u2192 A:2, B:1 \u21923\n\n18 \u2192 A:3, B:2 \u21925\n\n24 \u2192 A:4, B:2 \u21926\n\n27 \u2192 A:4, B:3 \u21927\n\n30 \u2192 A:5, B:3 \u21928\n\n36 \u2192 A:6, B:4 \u219210\n\nAh, so at 36 minutes, the total is exactly 10.

So the answer should be C.\n\n\nTo determine when Machine A and Machine B together produce a total of 10 yo-yos, we calculate the number of yo-yos each machine produces in a given time \\( t \\). Machine A produces \\( \\frac{t}{6} \\) yo-yos, and Machine B produces \\( \\frac{t}{9} \\) yo-yos. The total number of yo-yos produced is the sum of these two values, and we need this sum to equal 10.\n\nWe test each option:\n\n- **Option A (24 minutes):**  \n  Machine A produces \\( \\frac{24}{6} = 4 \\) yo-yos, and Machine B produces \\( \\frac{24}{9} \\approx 2.666 \\), which rounds down to 2.  \n  Total = \\( 4 + 2 = 6 \\), which is less than 10.\n\n- **Option B (32 minutes):**  \n  Machine A produces \\( \\frac{32}{6} \\approx 5.333 \\), which rounds down to 5, and Machine B produces \\( \\frac{32}{9} \\approx 3.555 \\), which rounds down to 3.  \n  Total = \\( 5 + 3 = 8 \\), which is less than 10.\n\n- **Option C (36 minutes):**  \n  Machine A produces \\( \\frac{36}{6} = 6 \\) yo-yos, and Machine B produces \\( \\frac{36}{9} = 4 \\).  \n  Total = \\( 6 + 4 = 10 \\), which matches the requirement.\n\n- **Option D (64 minutes):**  \n  Machine A produces \\( \\frac{64}{6} \\approx 10.666 \\), which rounds down to 10, and Machine B produces \\( \\frac{64}{9} \\approx 7.111 \\), which rounds down to 7.  \n  Total = \\( 10 + 7 = 17 \\), which is more than 10.\n\n- **Option E (72 minutes):**  \n  Machine A produces \\( \\frac{72}{6} = 12 \\) yo-yos, and Machine B produces \\( \\frac{72}{9} = 8 \\).  \n  Total = \\( 12 + 8 = 20 \\), which is also more than 10.\n\nThe only time when the total number of yo-yos produced by both machines is exactly 10 is at **36 minutes**.\n\nAnswer: C",
