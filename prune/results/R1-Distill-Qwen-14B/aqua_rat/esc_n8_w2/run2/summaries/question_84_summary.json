      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a square cloth that's being trimmed and then cut. Hmm, I need to find the perimeter of the original square. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nSo, the problem says: A square piece is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangle. Then this rectangle is cut diagonally into two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. I need to find the original square's perimeter.\n\nWait, let's visualize this. The original is a square. Let's say each side is 'x' feet. Then, when it's trimmed by 4 feet on one edge, that means one side becomes x-4. But since it's a square, all sides were the same, so the other side remains x. So the rectangle now has sides of x and x-4.\n\nWait no, wait a second. Oh, right, trimming on one edge\u2014so the original is a square, so all sides are equal. If you trim 4 feet off one edge, you're reducing one dimension. So for example, if the original square has sides of length L, then after trimming, the rectangle would be L by (L-4). Because you take off 4 feet from one side.\n\nThen, this rectangle is cut diagonally into two triangles. Each triangle's area is 70. So the area of the rectangle is twice that, which is 140 square feet. Because each triangle is half of the rectangle.\n\nWait, yes. The area of the rectangle is length times width, which is L*(L-4). And since each triangle is half of that, each has area (L*(L-4))/2 =70. So:\n\n(L*(L-4))/2 =70 \u2192 L*(L-4) =140.\n\nSo expanding that, L\u00b2 -4L =140 \u2192 L\u00b2 -4L -140 =0.\n\nHmm, solving this quadratic equation for L. Let's see, the quadratic is L\u00b2 -4L -140=0. Using quadratic formula: L = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 560)] / 2 \u2192 sqrt(576)=24. So L=(4+24)/2=28/2=14. Or (4-24)/2=-20/2=-10. Since length can't be negative, L=14 feet.\n\nSo the original square had sides of 14 feet. Therefore, the perimeter is 4*14=56 feet.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through the steps again.\n\nOriginal square: side L. Trim 4 on one edge \u2192 rectangle with sides L and L-4. Area of rectangle is L*(L-4). Each triangle is half that, so each area is [L*(L-4)]/2=70.\n\nSo, L*(L-4)=140 \u2192 L\u00b2-4L-140=0. The discriminant is 16 + 560=576, sqrt is 24. So L=(4+24)/2=14, correct. So the perimeter is 4*14=56, which is option A.\n\nWait, but the options given are A)56, B)58, etc. So the correct answer is A)56.\n",

Let me read it again and break it down.\n\nThe problem says: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangle. Then, this rectangle is cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. I need to find the perimeter of the original square cloth.\n\nHmm, okay. So the original shape is a square. Let's call the length of each side of the square 's'. Since it's a square, all sides are equal, so the area is s squared.\n\nThe first step is trimming 4 feet on one edge. Wait, trimming\u2014so I'm assuming that means reducing the length of one side by 4 feet. Because when you trim something on one edge, you're making it shorter along that edge. So if the original square has sides of length s, after trimming, one side becomes s-4. But wait, does that make it a rectangle? Because if you trim only one edge, the opposite edge remains the same length, but the other two edges are now s-4. So the new dimensions of the rectangle would be (s) and (s-4). Wait, no, wait a minute. Let me think: when you trim one edge by 4 feet, you're reducing the length on that side. So the original square has sides s, s, s, s. Trimming one edge (say, the length) by 4 feet would make that side s-4. So the rectangle would have two sides of s and two sides of (s-4). Wait, no, no. Wait, when you trim a square by 4 feet on one edge, you're making a rectangle. So imagine a square, and then you cut off 4 feet from one of its edges. So for example, if you have a square cloth, and you trim 4 feet from one of the sides, the new shape is a rectangle where one pair of sides is s (the original untrimmed length) and the other pair is (s -4), because that side was trimmed by 4 feet. So the rectangle's dimensions are s and (s-4).\n\nWait, but that would mean that the rectangle's sides are s and s-4. Because you've only trimmed one pair of sides. So the other pair remains s. So the area of the rectangle would be s*(s-4).\n\nThen, this rectangle is cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. So the area of the rectangle must be twice that, which is 140 square feet. Because when you cut it in half, each triangle is half the area of the rectangle.\n\nSo the area of the rectangle is s*(s-4) = 140.\n\nSo that gives me the equation: s(s-4) = 140.\n\nExpanding that: s\u00b2 -4s = 140.\n\nBring 140 to the left: s\u00b2 -4s -140 = 0.\n\nHmm, solving this quadratic equation. Let's see, quadratic formula: s = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 560)] / 2.\n\nBecause the equation is s\u00b2 -4s -140 = 0. So a=1, b=-4, c=-140.\n\nDiscriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac = 16 + 560 = 576.\n\nSquare root of 576 is 24.\n\nSo s = [4 \u00b1 24]/2.\n\nWe can ignore the negative solution because length can't be negative. So s = (4 + 24)/2 = 28/2 = 14.\n\nWait, so s is 14 feet. So the original square was 14 feet on each side.\n\nSo the perimeter of the original square is 4*s = 4*14 = 56 feet.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 56. So the answer would be A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check everything because sometimes I make mistakes.\n\nWait, wait. Let me go back. So when the square is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge, the rectangle is s by (s-4). So area is s*(s-4) = 140.\n\nSo s\u00b2 -4s -140 =0.\n\nSolving that, s = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 +560)]/2 = [4 \u00b1 24]/2.\n\nPositive solution is (4+24)/2=28/2=14. So s=14.\n\nOriginal perimeter is 4*14=56. So option A.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is the area of the rectangle indeed 140? Because each triangle is 70, two of them make 140. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the area of the triangle is (base*height)/2. But wait, in this case, the triangle is a right-angled triangle because the rectangle is cut diagonally. So the base and height would be the sides of the rectangle.\n\nSo for each triangle, the area is (s*(s-4))/2 = 70.\n\nBecause the area of the rectangle is s*(s-4), and when cut in half, each triangle is half of that. So (s*(s-4))/2 =70 \u2192 s*(s-4) =140, which brings us back to the same equation.\n\nSo yes, s=14, perimeter is 56. So answer is A)56.\n\nBut wait, the options include 56 as option A. So the answer is A.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I miscalculate the area of the triangle? Because sometimes when you cut a rectangle diagonally, the area of each triangle is indeed half the rectangle's area. So 70 each, so 140 total.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n",
