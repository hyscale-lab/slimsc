      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where Arjun and Sajal are friends with some money, and there are two scenarios involving them giving each other money. I need to figure out how much each of them has initially. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nThe problem says: If Arun (I think that's Arjun) gives $30 to Sajal, then Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. Wait, wait, wait. So, Arjun gives $30 to Sajal. That means Arjun's money decreases by $30, and Sajal's increases by $30. After that, Sajal's money is twice what Arjun has left. So let me write that down.\n\nLet me assign variables. Let's say Arjun has A dollars and Sajal has S dollars.\n\nFirst scenario: Arjun gives $30 to Sajal.\nAfter that, Arjun has A - 30, and Sajal has S + 30.\nAccording to the problem, Sajal's money is twice Arjun's at that point. So:\n\nS + 30 = 2*(A - 30)  [Equation 1]\n\nThat's the first equation.\n\nSecond scenario: Sajal gives $10 to Arjun.\nSo Sajal's money becomes S - 10, and Arjun's becomes A + 10.\nIn this case, Arjun will have thrice as much as Sajal. So:\n\nA + 10 = 3*(S - 10)  [Equation 2]\n\nNow I have two equations. I can solve them simultaneously to find A and S.\n\nLet me write them out again:\n\n1) S + 30 = 2(A - 30)\n2) A + 10 = 3(S - 10)\n\nI can expand both equations to make it easier.\n\nExpanding equation 1:\nS + 30 = 2A - 60\nBring all terms to one side:\nS = 2A - 60 - 30\nS = 2A - 90   [Equation 1a]\n\nExpanding equation 2:\nA + 10 = 3S - 30\nBring all terms to one side:\nA = 3S - 30 -10\nA = 3S -40   [Equation 2a]\n\nNow, I can substitute equation 1a into equation 2a.\n\nFrom equation 1a, S = 2A -90. Substitute S into equation 2a.\n\nA = 3*(2A -90) -40\nLet me compute that:\n\nA = 6A - 270 -40\nA = 6A -310\n\nHmm, let's subtract 6A from both sides to get:\n\nA -6A = -310\n-5A = -310\n\nDivide both sides by -5:\nA = (-310)/(-5) = 62.\n\nSo Arjun has $62.\n\nNow, substitute A=62 into equation 1a to find S.\n\nS = 2*(62) -90\nS = 124 -90 = 34.\n\nSo Sajal has $34.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check these numbers with the original scenarios to make sure.\n\nFirst scenario: Arjun gives $30 to Sajal.\n\nArjun now has 62-30=32. Sajal has 34+30=64. Is 64 twice 32? Yes, because 32 *2=64. That checks out.\n\nSecond scenario: Sajal gives $10 to Arjun.\n\nArjun now has 62+10=72. Sajal has 34-10=24. Is 72 three times 24? 24 *3=72. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the initial amounts are Arjun $62, Sajal $34.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 62,34. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA)62, 35\n\nB)62, 34\n\nC)34, 62\n\nD)42, 62\n\nE)62,42\n\nSo option B matches what I found: Arjun 62, Sajal 34.\n",
