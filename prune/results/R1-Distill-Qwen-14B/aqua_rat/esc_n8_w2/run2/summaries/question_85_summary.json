      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking. The question says, \"The length of the ribbon was originally 30 cm. It was reduced in the ratio 5:3. What is its length now?\" And there are five options to choose from: A)18, B)30, C)6, D)15, E)12.\n\nHmm, ratios can be a bit tricky, but I think I get the basics. So, the ribbon was reduced in the ratio 5:3. Wait, what does that mean exactly? I remember that ratios compare quantities. So, if something is reduced in a ratio, I guess it's scaled down by that ratio.\n\nLet me think. The original length is 30 cm. The ratio given is 5:3. So, I'm assuming that the ratio 5:3 is the new length to the original length. Or wait, is it the original to the new? Oh right, because it's a reduction, the new length should be shorter. So, the original is larger, and the new is smaller.\n\nWait, ratios can be a bit confusing in terms of which part comes first. If the ratio is 5:3, and it's a reduction, then the original length corresponds to 5 parts, and the new length corresponds to 3 parts. Or is it the other way around? No, wait, no. Because when you reduce something, the new amount is a fraction of the original. So, if the ratio is 5:3, it's like 5 parts original to 3 parts new. So, the new length is (3/5) of the original. That makes sense because 3 is less than 5, so the new length is smaller.\n\nSo, let me write that down. Original length = 30 cm. New length = (3/5) * original length. So, 30 multiplied by 3/5.\n\nWait, 30 times 3 is 90, divided by 5 is 18. So, the new length is 18 cm. Let me check the options. Option A is 18. So, that should be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused sometimes. Could the ratio be original to new or new to original? Let me think. The problem says it was reduced in the ratio 5:3. So, the ratio is original : new. So, 5 parts to 3 parts. So, 5 parts corresponds to the original, which is 30. So, each part is 30 divided by 5, which is 6. Then the new length is 3 parts, which is 3*6=18 cm. Yep, same answer. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: If the ratio is 5:3, then the new length is 3/5 of the original. So, 3/5 *30=18 cm. That's the same as before. So, definitely, the answer is A)18.\n\nAlternatively, if I had thought the ratio was new to original, that would have been 3:5, and the new length would have been 18, which is still the same. Wait, no. Wait, if the ratio is new:original, then 3:5 would imply new is 3/5 of original. Which is exactly what I did earlier. So, either way, same result. So, the answer is A.\n",

Hmm, ratios can be a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nWait, what does it mean when something is reduced in a ratio? I think a ratio compares two quantities. So if the original length was 30 cm and it's reduced to a ratio of 5:3, I'm guessing that 5 parts become 3 parts. Oh right, because when you reduce something, you're making it smaller. So the original is larger, and the new is smaller.\n\nSo the original ribbon is 5 parts, and the reduced ribbon is 3 parts. Or wait, maybe I have that reversed. Because when you reduce, the ratio of the original to the new is 5:3. Or is it the new to original? I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no. If the ribbon is reduced in the ratio 5:3, that probably means the original length corresponds to 5 parts, and the new length corresponds to 3 parts. Because reducing implies the new is smaller. So for every 5 cm of original, it's now 3 cm. So the ratio is original : new = 5:3.\n\nSo if the original is 5 parts and the new is 3 parts, then the original length is 5 parts equal to 30 cm. So each part would be 30 divided by 5. Let me calculate that. 30 divided by 5 is 6. So each part is 6 cm.\n\nNow, the new length is 3 parts. So 3 multiplied by 6 is 18. So the new length should be 18 cm. Let me look at the options. Option A is 18, so that's probably the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the ratio. Could it be that the ratio is new : original = 5:3 instead? No, that wouldn't make sense because then the new length would be longer than the original. Since it's a reduction, the new should be shorter. So original:reduced = 5:3 makes sense.\n\nAnother way to think about it: if the ratio is 5:3, then the reduced length is (3/5) of the original.
