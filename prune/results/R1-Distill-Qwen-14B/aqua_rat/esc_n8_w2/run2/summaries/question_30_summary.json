      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question says, \"When I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age. Now I am 60 years old, how old is my brother?\" And there are five options: 59, 69, 79, 89, or 99.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. I'm trying to figure out the age difference between me and my brother. Because if I can find that, I can apply it when I'm 60 to find his age.\n\nSo, when I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age. Wait, half of 2 is 1. So at that time, I was 2 and he was 1. That means he's a year younger than me, right? Because 2 minus 1 is 1. So the age difference between us is 1 year.\n\nBut wait, does that mean he's always been a year younger? Because age differences don't change over time. So if I'm now 60, then my brother should be 60 minus 1, which is 59. So option A)59.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Let's think about the timeline. When I was 2, he was 1. So the age difference is 1 year. So when I'm 60, he's 60 minus 1, which is 59. That seems straightforward.\n\nWait a second, but sometimes these problems can be tricky. Could I have made a mistake in calculating the difference? Let's see. If I'm 2 and he's 1, the difference is 1. So yes, I'm older by 1 year. So when I'm 60, he's 59. So the answer should be A.\n\nBut let me think again. Another way to approach it: Let's denote my current age as I, which is 60. The brother's current age is B. The age difference is I - B. When I was 2, my brother was 2 minus (I - B), because the difference stays the same. At that time, he was half my age. So when I was 2, he was 2 - (I - B) = 1, because half of 2 is 1. So 2 - (I - B) = 1. Let's solve for I - B.\n\n2 - (I - B) = 1\nSo, -(I - B) = 1 - 2\n-(I - B) = -1\nMultiply both sides by -1: I - B = 1. So the age difference is 1 year.\n\nTherefore, my brother is 1 year younger than me. So when I'm 60, he's 59. That's option A.\n\nWait, but another way: Let's calculate the age difference. When I was 2, he was 1. So the difference is 1 year. So regardless of when, he is always 1 year younger. So now, I'm 60, he's 60 -1 =59. So yes, A is correct.\n",
