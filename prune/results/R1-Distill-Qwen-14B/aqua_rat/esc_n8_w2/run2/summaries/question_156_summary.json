      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. The sum of k consecutive integers is 51, and the least integer is -50. I need to find what k is. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nAlright, I remember that the sum of consecutive integers can be calculated using the formula for an arithmetic series. Since they are consecutive, the common difference is 1. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is S = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference. In this case, d is 1 because they are consecutive integers.\n\nWait, but wait. Alternatively, I also remember another formula where the sum is the average of the first and last term multiplied by the number of terms. So S = (a1 + ak) * k / 2. Since the numbers are consecutive, the last term is a1 + (k-1)*1, which is a1 + k-1.\n\nGiven that the least integer is -50, so a1 is -50. The sum S is 51. So plugging into the second formula: 51 = ( (-50) + (last term) ) * k / 2.\n\nLet me write that down. Let the last term be L. Then L = a1 + (k-1)*d. Since d=1, L = -50 + k -1 = k -51.\n\nSo substituting back into the sum equation: 51 = ( (-50) + (k-51) ) * k / 2.\n\nLet me simplify that numerator. (-50) + (k -51) equals k -50 -51 = k -101. So the equation becomes 51 = (k -101) * k / 2.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator: 102 = k(k -101).\n\nExpanding the right side: 102 = k\u00b2 -101k.\n\nBringing all terms to one side: k\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0.\n\nNow I have a quadratic equation in terms of k. Let's write that down: k\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0.\n\nI need to solve for k. Hmm, perhaps I can factor this quadratic. Let's see if that's possible. The product of the roots should be -102, and the sum should be 101.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -102 and add to 101. Hmm. Let's think: factors of 102 are 1 & 102, 2 & 51, 3 & 34, 6 & 17.\n\nWait, since the product is negative, one of the numbers is positive and the other negative. We need two numbers where the positive is bigger than the negative, so their sum is positive 101.\n\nLet me try 102 and -1. 102 * (-1) = -102. Sum is 102 + (-1) = 101. Yes! That works.\n\nSo the factors are (k -102)(k +1) = 0.\n\nSo the solutions are k = 102 or k = -1. But k can't be negative because it's the number of terms, so k must be 102.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 102. So that's one of the choices.\n\nBut wait a minute, let me double-check because 102 seems like a lot. Let me verify the calculations.\n\nStarting again: sum S is 51, a1 is -50, k is 102.\n\nSum S = (a1 + ak) * k / 2.\n\nak is a1 + (k-1)*1 = -50 +101 =51.\n\nSo a1 is -50, ak is 51. So the sum is (-50 +51)*102/2 = (1)*51=51. That's correct.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. If k is 102, the numbers go from -50 up to 51. Let me check how many numbers that is. From -50 to 51 inclusive.\n\nWait, the count from -50 to 0 is 51 numbers (including 0), and from 1 to 51 is 51 numbers. So total is 51 +51=102. So yes, that adds up.\n\nAlternatively, when I calculated ak as a1 + (k-1), which would be -50 +101=51. That's correct.\n\nSo the sum is ( (-50) +51 ) *102 /2 = (1)*51=51, which matches. So k=102 is correct.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 102. So the answer should be E.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because another option is D)92. Did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me check my quadratic equation again.\n\nWait, the quadratic equation was k\u00b2 -101k -102 =0. Factoring as (k-102)(k+1)=0. So yes, k=102 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should have considered the formula another way. Another approach: the sum of consecutive integers can also be expressed as average times number of terms. The average is (a1 + ak)/2. So the sum is average * k.\n\nWait, same as before. So I think I'm confident that k is 102. So the answer is E.\n",

I remember there's a formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. Since these are consecutive integers, the common difference is 1.

Or sometimes I've heard it as S = n/2 * (first term + last term). Oh right, because the last term is a + (n-1)d. So maybe that's easier here.\n\nSince the common difference d is 1, the last term would be -50 + (k-1)*1, right? Which is -50 + k -1 = k -51.\n\nSo the sum S is k/2 * (-50 + (k-51)).

So the equation becomes (k/2) * (k - 101) = 51.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator: k*(k-101) = 102.\n\nExpanding that, k\u00b2 - 101k - 102 = 0.

Substituting these into the formula for the sum:\n\n\\[\n51 = \\frac{k}{2} \\times \\left(-50 + (-50 + k - 1)\\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the terms inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[\n-50 + (-50 + k - 1) = k - 101\n\\]\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n51 = \\frac{k}{2} \\times (k - 101)\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\nk(k - 101) = 102\n\\]\n\nExpanding and rearranging:\n\n\\[\nk^2 - 101k - 102 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which can be solved using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -101 \\), and \\( c = -102 \\). Substituting these values:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{-(-101) \\pm \\sqrt{(-101)^2 - 4(1)(-102)}}{2(1)}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the discriminant:\n\n\\[\n(-101)^2 = 10201, \\quad 4(1)(-102) = -408, \\quad \\text{so } \\sqrt{10201 + 408} = \\sqrt{10609} = 103\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{101 \\pm 103}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis gives two solutions:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{101 + 103}{2} = \\frac{204}{2} = 102, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad k = \\frac{101 - 103}{2} = \\frac{-2}{2} = -1\n\\]\n\nSince \\( k \\) represents the number of terms, it cannot be negative. Therefore, \\( k = 102 \\).\n\nTo verify, the first term is \\(-50\\), and the last term is \\(-50 + (102 - 1) = 51\\). The sum is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = \\frac{102}{2} \\times (-50 + 51) = 51\n\\]\n\nThis confirms that \\( k = 102 \\) is correct.\n\nAnswer: E",
