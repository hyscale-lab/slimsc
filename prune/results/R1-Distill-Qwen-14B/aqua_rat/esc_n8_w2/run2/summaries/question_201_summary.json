      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the rate of interest. The question says that the difference between simple interest and compound interest on Rs.5000 for 2 years is Rs.72. The options given are A)10%, B)12%, C)6%, D)8%, E)4%. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that simple interest (SI) is calculated as Principal \u00d7 Rate \u00d7 Time, right? So SI = P \u00d7 R \u00d7 T. In this case, P is 5000, T is 2 years. So SI = 5000 \u00d7 R \u00d7 2.\n\nThen, compound interest (CI) for 2 years would be calculated as P \u00d7 (1 + R/100)^T - P. So CI = 5000 \u00d7 (1 + R/100)^2 - 5000. Alternatively, I can expand that. Let me think, (1 + R/100)^2 is 1 + 2(R/100) + (R/100)^2. So CI = 5000 \u00d7 [1 + 2(R/100) + (R^2)/(10000)] - 5000. That simplifies to 5000 \u00d7 2(R/100) + 5000 \u00d7 (R\u00b2)/(10000). Which further becomes 100R + (R\u00b2 \u00d7 5000)/(10000) \u2192 100R + (R\u00b2 \u00d7 0.5). So CI = 100R + 0.5R\u00b2.\n\nWait, but wait, that's the amount. Oh right, the CI itself is the amount minus principal, so yeah, that's correct. So the CI is 100R + 0.5R\u00b2.\n\nNow, the simple interest for 2 years is 5000 \u00d7 R \u00d7 2 = 10000R. So SI = 10000R.\n\nThe difference between CI and SI is given as 72. So CI - SI = 72. Substituting the expressions I have: (100R + 0.5R\u00b2) - (10000R) = 72. Wait, no, wait a second. That can't be right because 100R is way smaller than 10000R. Let me recheck.\n\nWait no, wait. I think I made a mistake in my earlier step. Let me correct that.\n\nActually, the correct formula for CI is P \u00d7 (1 + R/100)^T - P. So for T=2, it's P[(1 + R/100)^2 -1]. Let me calculate that.\n\nSo CI = 5000 * [(1 + R/100)^2 - 1] = 5000 * [1 + 2(R/100) + (R/100)^2 -1] = 5000 * [2(R/100) + (R\u00b2)/(10000)].\n\nSo that becomes 5000 * (2R/100) = 5000*(R/50) = 100R. And 5000*(R\u00b2)/(10000) = (5000 R\u00b2)/10000 = R\u00b2/2.\n\nSo CI = 100R + (R\u00b2)/2.\n\nSimple Interest is SI = 5000 \u00d7 R \u00d7 2 = 10000 R.\n\nThe difference between CI and SI is CI - SI = (100R + 0.5 R\u00b2) - (10000 R) = 72.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 100R minus 10000 R is -9900 R, which would make the equation negative. That doesn't make sense. Oh wait, no, because I think I mixed up the expressions.\n\nWait no, wait. Wait, the difference is CI - SI, right? So if CI is greater than SI, the difference is positive. Let me recheck the expressions.\n\nWait, CI is 100 R + 0.5 R^2. SI is 10000 R. So CI - SI = (100R + 0.5 R^2) - 10000 R = 0.5 R^2 -9900 R = 72.\n\nWait, that gives 0.5 R\u00b2 - 9900 R =72. That seems a bit complicated, but perhaps I can rearrange it.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: The difference between CI and SI for two years is given by the formula P*(R/100)^2. Because for two years, the extra amount in CI comes from the interest on the first year's interest. So the difference is SI for the second year, which is P*(R/100) for the first year (which is same as SI for 1 year) plus the interest on that for the second year. Wait, maybe that's not the right way. Alternatively, I've heard that the difference between CI and SI for two years is P*(R/100)^2. Let me check.\n\nWait, let me compute the difference:\n\nCI = P*(1 + R/100)^2 - P = P*(2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2 )\n\nSI = P*(2R/100 )\n\nSo difference = CI - SI = P*(2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2 ) - P*(2R/100) ) = P*(R/100)^2.\n\nSo the difference is P*(R/100)^2.\n\nAh! So difference = 5000*(R/100)^2 = 72.\n\nSo 5000*(R\u00b2)/(10000) ) =72.\n\nSimplify that: (5000 * R\u00b2) / 10000 = 72 \u2192 (R\u00b2 *5000)/(10000) = R\u00b2 * 0.5 =72.\n\nSo 0.5 R\u00b2 =72 \u2192 R\u00b2 =72 *2 \u2192 R\u00b2=144 \u2192 R=12.\n\nWait, but R is in percentage. So R=12% per annum.\n\nSo the rate is 12%, which is option B.\n\nWait, that makes sense because when I plug R=12 into the earlier formula, the difference should be 72.\n\nLet me double-check. 5000*(12/100)^2 =5000*(0.144)=720? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 12 squared is 144, so 5000*(144)/(10000) = (5000*144)/(10000) \u2192 5000/10000 is 0.5, so 0.5*144=72. Oh right, that's correct.\n\nSo the rate is 12%, which is option B.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about simple interest and compound interest. Hmm, the question says that the difference between the two for Rs.5000 over 2 years is Rs.72. I need to find the rate of interest. The options are given, so maybe I can work through the formulas and see which one fits.\n\nAlright, let's start by recalling the formulas for simple interest (SI) and compound interest (CI). \n\nFor simple interest, the formula is:\nSI = (P * R * T) / 100\nWhere P is principal, R is rate, T is time.\n\nFor compound interest, when compounded annually, the formula is:\nCI = P * ( (1 + R/100)^T ) - P\nWhich can also be written as CI = P[(1 + R/100)^T - 1]\n\nThe problem states that the difference between CI and SI is Rs.72. So, CI - SI = 72.\n\nLet me plug in the values. The principal P is 5000, time T is 2 years. So:\n\nCI = 5000 * [(1 + R/100)^2 - 1]\nSI = (5000 * R * 2) / 100 = 100 R (since 5000*2=10000, 10000*R/100=100R)\n\nSo the difference is CI - SI = 72. Let's write that equation:\n\n5000 * [(1 + R/100)^2 - 1] - 100 R = 72\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated. Let me try to simplify it. Let's expand the (1 + R/100)^2 term.\n\n(1 + R/100)^2 = 1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2\nSo, CI becomes 5000 * [1 + 2(R/100) + (R^2)/(10000) - 1] = 5000 * [ 2R/100 + (R^2)/(10000) ]\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n2R/100 = R/50, and R\u00b2/(10000) remains as is.\n\nSo CI is 5000*(R/50 + R\u00b2/(10000)) = 5000*(R/50) + 5000*(R\u00b2/10000)\nCalculating each term:\n5000 * R/50 = 100 R\n5000 * R\u00b2/10000 = (5000/10000) * R\u00b2 = 0.5 R\u00b2\n\nSo CI = 100 R + 0.5 R\u00b2\n\nAnd the SI is 100 R, so the difference (CI - SI) is (100 R + 0.5 R\u00b2) - 100 R = 0.5 R\u00b2\n\nWait, but the difference is given as 72, so 0.5 R\u00b2 =72 \u2192 R\u00b2= 144 \u2192 R=12? Because 12 squared is 144.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because sometimes I might have messed up the calculations.\n\nWait, wait, let me go through the steps again. So the difference is CI - SI = 72.\n\nCI is 5000*(1 + R/100)^2 -5000\nWhich is 5000*( (1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2 ) -1 ) =5000*(2R/100 + R\u00b2/(10000) )\n\nSo that's 5000*( (2R + R\u00b2/100) ) / 100 \u2192 Wait, no, 2R/100 is R/50, and R\u00b2/(10000) is as is.\n\nSo CI is 5000*(R/50 + R\u00b2/(10000)) \u2192 Let's compute each part:\n\n5000 * (R/50) = 5000/50 * R = 100 R\n5000 * (R\u00b2/10000) = (5000/10000) * R\u00b2 = 0.5 R\u00b2\n\nSo CI is 100 R + 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nThe SI is 100 R.\n\nSo the difference is 0.5 R\u00b2 =72 \u2192 R\u00b2 = 144 \u2192 R =12% because 12*12=144.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 12%. So that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation. Let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute the difference using the formula for the difference between CI and SI for two years, which is generally given by (P*(R/100)^2). Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, the difference for two years when compounded annually is P*(R/100)^2 + P*(R/100)*(2R/100). Hmm, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: The difference between CI and SI for two years is P*(R/100)*(R/100) + P*(R/100)^2 * something. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the standard formula that the difference between CI and SI for two years is (P*(R^2))/10000.\n\nWait, let me see: the difference is CI - SI = (P*(R/100)^2) + (P*(R/100)*(2*R/100)) ?\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me calculate using the standard approach.\n\nThe formula for the difference between CI and SI over two years is P*(R^2)/(100^2). Wait, no, because for two years, the extra amount from CI is P*(R^2)/(100^2) + P*(R/100)*(2R/100). Hmm, perhaps that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to directly compute the difference using the formulas.\n\nSo, CI for two years is P*(1 + R/100)^2 - P = P*( (1 + 2R/100 + R\u00b2/(100)^2 ) -1 ) = P*(2R/100 + R\u00b2/(100)^2 )\n\nWhich is P*(2R + R\u00b2/100)/100.\n\nSI is P*R*T/100 = P*2R/100.\n\nSo, the difference is CI - SI = [P*(2R + R\u00b2/100)/100 ] - [ P*2R/100 ]\n\n= P*(2R + R\u00b2/100 - 2R)/100\n\n= P*(R\u00b2/100)/100 = P*R\u00b2/(100^2) \u2192 P R\u00b2 / (10000)\n\nSo the difference is (5000 * R^2 ) / 10000 = (5000 * R\u00b2)/10000 \u2192 which simplifies to (R\u00b2 *5000)/10000 = (R\u00b2)/2\n\nAnd the problem states that this difference is 72.\n\nSo:\n\n(R\u00b2)/2 = 72 \u2192 R\u00b2 = 144 \u2192 R=12.\n\nYes, that matches what I found earlier. So the rate is 12%, which is option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about simple interest and compound interest. Hmm, the question says that the difference between the two for Rs.5000 over 2 years is Rs.72. I need to find the rate of interest. The options are given, so maybe I can work through the formulas and see which one fits.\n\nAlright, let's start by recalling the formulas for simple interest (SI) and compound interest (CI). \n\nFor simple interest, the formula is:\nSI = (P * R * T) / 100\nWhere P is principal, R is rate, T is time.\n\nFor compound interest, when compounded annually, the formula is:\nCI = P * ( (1 + R/100)^T ) - P\nWhich can also be written as CI = P[(1 + R/100)^T - 1]\n\nThe problem states that the difference between CI and SI is Rs.72. So, CI - SI = 72.\n\nLet me plug in the values. The principal P is 5000, time T is 2 years. So:\n\nCI = 5000 * [(1 + R/100)^2 - 1]\nSI = (5000 * R * 2) / 100 = 100 R (since 5000*2=10000, 10000*R/100=100R)\n\nSo the difference is CI - SI = 72. Let's write that equation:\n\n5000 * [(1 + R/100)^2 - 1] - 100 R = 72\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated. Let me try to simplify it. Let's expand the (1 + R/100)^2 term.\n\n(1 + R/100)^2 = 1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2\nSo, CI becomes 5000 * [1 + 2(R/100) + (R^2)/(10000) - 1] = 5000 * [ 2R/100 + (R^2)/(10000) ]\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n2R/100 = R/50, and R\u00b2/(10000) remains as is.\n\nSo CI is 5000*(R/50 + R\u00b2/(10000)) = 5000*(R/50) + 5000*(R\u00b2/10000)\nCalculating each term:\n5000 * R/50 = 100 R\n5000 * R\u00b2/10000 = (5000/10000) * R\u00b2 = 0.5 R\u00b2\n\nSo CI = 100 R + 0.5 R\u00b2\n\nAnd the SI is 100 R, so the difference (CI - SI) is (100 R + 0.5 R\u00b2) - 100 R = 0.5 R\u00b2\n\nWait, but the difference is given as 72, so 0.5 R\u00b2 =72 \u2192 R\u00b2= 144 \u2192 R=12? Because 12 squared is 144.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because sometimes I might have messed up the calculations.\n\nWait, wait, let me go through the steps again. So the difference is CI - SI = 72.\n\nCI is 5000*(1 + R/100)^2 -5000\nWhich is 5000*( (1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2 ) -1 ) =5000*(2R/100 + R\u00b2/(10000) )\n\nSo that's 5000*( (2R + R\u00b2/100) ) / 100 \u2192 Wait, no, 2R/100 is R/50, and R\u00b2/(10000) is as is.\n\nSo CI is 5000*(R/50 + R\u00b2/(10000)) \u2192 Let's compute each part:\n\n5000 * (R/50) = 5000/50 * R = 100 R\n5000 * (R\u00b2/10000) = (5000/10000) * R\u00b2 = 0.5 R\u00b2\n\nSo CI is 100 R + 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nThe SI is 100 R.\n\nSo the difference is 0.5 R\u00b2 =72 \u2192 R\u00b2 = 144 \u2192 R =12% because 12*12=144.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 12%. So that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation. Let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute the difference using the formula for the difference between CI and SI for two years, which is generally given by (P*(R/100)^2). Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, the difference for two years when compounded annually is P*(R/100)^2 + P*(R/100)*(2R/100). Hmm, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: The difference between CI and SI for two years is P*(R/100)*(R/100) + P*(R/100)^2 * something. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the standard formula that the difference between CI and SI for two years is (P*(R^2))/10000.\n\nWait, let me see: the difference is CI - SI = (P*(R/100)^2) + (P*(R/100)*(2*R/100)) ?\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me calculate using the standard approach.\n\nThe formula for the difference between CI and SI over two years is P*(R^2)/(100^2). Wait, no, because for two years, the extra amount from CI is P*(R^2)/(100^2) + P*(R/100)*(2R/100).
