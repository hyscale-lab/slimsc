      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out the units digit of 9^3 minus 7. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. First, I remember that the units digit is the last digit of a number. So, when you subtract two numbers, the units digit of the result depends only on the units digits of the original numbers involved.\n\nWait, right, so for exponents, sometimes the units digit follows a pattern that repeats. Let me think about 9 raised to different powers. Like, 9^1 is 9, so units digit is 9. 9^2 is 81, so units digit is 1. 9^3 would be 9 multiplied by 81. Let me calculate that. 9 times 80 is 720, and 9 times 1 is 9, so 720 +9 is 729. So 9^3 is 729, right? So the units digit of 9^3 is 9.\n\nNow, the problem is 9^3 minus 7. So 729 minus 7. Let me subtract that. 729 minus 7 is 722. So the number we're looking at is 722. The units digit is the last digit, which is 2. Wait, but wait a second\u2014am I allowed to just do that directly? Or is there a smarter way without calculating the entire number?\n\nAlternatively, since we're only interested in the units digit, perhaps I can compute each part's units digit and then subtract. So, 9^3 has units digit 9, as I found earlier. Then, 7 has a units digit of 7. So 9 (from 9^3) minus 7 equals 2. So the units digit should be 2.\n\nLet me double-check. 9^3 is 729, minus 7 is 722. Yes, the units digit is 2. So the correct answer should be option D, which is 2.\n",

Units digit is basically the last digit of the number when it's written out. So I think I should compute 9^3 first and then subtract 7, but maybe there's a shortcut to find just the units digit without calculating the whole number. That would save time, right?\n\nWait, 9 cubed is 9 multiplied by itself three times. Let me calculate that. 9 times 9 is 81, then 81 times 9. Oh wait, 81 times 9, let me do that. 80 times 9 is 720, and 1 times 9 is 9, so 720 plus 9 is 729. So 9^3 is 729. \n\nNow, subtract 7 from that. 729 minus 7 is 722. So the number is 722.
