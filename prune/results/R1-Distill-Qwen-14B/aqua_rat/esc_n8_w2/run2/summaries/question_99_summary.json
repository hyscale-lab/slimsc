      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out how much Meenu weighs based on what she said. Let me try to break this down. So, Silu and Meenu are walking, and Silu tells her weight, which is 51 kg. Then Meenu says she won't tell her weight directly because she's overweight. Instead, she gives a clue: \"I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight.\" Hmm, that's a bit tricky, but I think I can work through it.\n\nWait, so Meenu says her weight is 29 kg plus half of her weight. That doesn't make immediate sense because half of her weight would be part of her total. So maybe I should set up an equation based on her statement.\n\nLet me denote Meenu's weight as M. According to her statement, M equals 29 plus half of M. So, in equation form, that's M = 29 + (M/2). That makes sense.\n\nNow, I need to solve for M. Let's rearrange the equation. Subtract (M/2) from both sides to get M - (M/2) = 29. Simplifying the left side, M minus half of M is the same as half of M. So, (M/2) = 29.\n\nTo find M, I can multiply both sides by 2. That gives M = 29 * 2, which is 58. Wait, so Meenu weighs 58 kg? Let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nPlugging M=58 back into her statement: 29 plus half of 58. Half of 58 is 29, so 29 + 29 equals 58. Yep, that works out. So Meenu's weight is 58 kg.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 58. So the answer should be D.\n",

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. Meenu's statement is a bit confusing at first glance. She says, \"I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight.\" Wait, that sounds a bit circular because she's referring to her own weight. So I guess I need to set up an equation based on what she said.\n\nLet me denote Meenu's weight as W. According to her statement, W equals 29 plus half of W. So the equation would be W = 29 + (1/2)W. \n\nWait, that makes sense. So I can solve for W here. Let me write that down:\n\nW = 29 + (1/2)W.\n\nHmm, okay, so I can subtract (1/2)W from both sides to get all the W terms on one side. Let's see:\n\nW - (1/2)W = 29.\n\nWhich simplifies to (1/2)W = 29. Oh right, because 1W minus 0.5W is 0.5W. \n\nSo then, multiplying both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n(1/2)W * 2 = 29 * 2.\n\nThat gives W = 58. So Meenu's weight is 58 Kgs.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Plugging the value back into the original statement. If W is 58, then half of that is 29.
