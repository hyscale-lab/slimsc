      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.\n\nAlright, the problem is about three friends\u2014Alan, Roger, and Peter\u2014answering a question on an exam. Each has a different probability of getting the answer right. The question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. Hmm, okay, so I need to find the probability that at least one of them answers correctly, but without considering Roger's cheating method. Wait, no, wait. Let me read the question again.\n\nOh, right. The question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So that means we want the scenario where someone answers correctly, but not through cheating. So, cheating is Roger's method. So, we need to find the probability that the correct answer is achieved without cheating, meaning either Alan or Peter got it right, but not Roger. Wait, no. Wait, perhaps it's the probability that the question is correctly answered, but the correct answer wasn't achieved through cheating, meaning only Alan or Peter contributed to the correct answer. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the answer is correct, but that the correctness wasn't due to cheating. So, the correct answer could have come from either Alan or Peter. Because Roger's method is cheating, so if he answers correctly, that's via cheating. So, the question is about the case where the correct answer is given, but it wasn't because Roger cheated. So, the correct answer could come from Alan or Peter, but not from Roger.\n\nWait, but the way the question is phrased is: \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but not through Roger's cheating. So, that means the correct answer could have come from either Alan or Peter, but not Roger.\n\nWait, but what if both Alan and Peter are correct? No, wait. Because the question is about the correctness of the answer. So, if any of the three answer correctly, the question is considered correctly answered. But we want the case where the correct answer is achieved, but it's not via cheating\u2014so, the correct answer must have come from either Alan or Peter, but not Roger.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me clarify. The question is about the overall correctness, but the method. So, if the question is answered correctly, but the correct answer wasn't achieved via cheating, meaning that the correct answer was due to either Alan guessing or Peter doing the work. So, the correct answer is achieved, and it's through either Alan or Peter. But if Roger answered correctly, that's via cheating, which we want to exclude.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the correct answer is given, but Roger didn't cheat to get it. Hmm. Maybe it's better to model it as the probability that the question is answered correctly, but Roger didn't answer it correctly (because if Roger did, that's cheating, and we want the case where cheating didn't contribute).\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is looking for the probability that the correct answer is given, but not through Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer could have come from Alan or Peter. So, in other words, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. But wait, the question is about the overall correct answer, not who answered it. So perhaps the question is whether the correct answer is given by any of the three, but in the case where it's not due to cheating, i.e., not Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly, without considering Roger's correct answers. Or maybe the probability that the correct answer is provided without cheating, meaning that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, but Roger didn't. Hmm.\n\nLet me approach this methodically.\n\nFirst, the individual probabilities:\n\n- Alan's probability of being correct: 1/5.\n- Roger's probability of being correct: 2/3 (but this is via cheating, so we need to exclude cases where Roger is correct when considering the 'not via cheating' part).\n- Peter's probability: 5/6.\n\nWe need the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not through Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer could have been achieved by Alan or Peter, but not Roger.\n\nBut wait, the way the question is phrased, it's about the correctness of the answer, regardless of who answered it. So, the question is answered correctly if at least one of the three got it right. But we want the scenario where the correct answer is achieved, but that correct answer wasn't achieved via cheating. So, perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but Roger did not contribute to it. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps another way to think about it is: what is the probability that the correct answer is given, but it's not because Roger cheated. So, the correct answer comes from Alan or Peter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the correct answer is given, but it's not via cheating, which would mean that the correct answer came from Alan or Peter. So, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not via Roger's cheating.\n\nSo, to calculate this, perhaps we need to find the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer. But wait, no, because if Roger's answer is correct, that would be via cheating, which we want to exclude. So, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not via Roger's method.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the probability as follows: the correct answer is achieved, but it's not through Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved either by Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the probability we want is the probability that either Alan is correct, or Peter is correct, or both. But we must also exclude the cases where Roger is correct because that would involve cheating. Wait, but the problem is about the correctness of the answer, not about who answered. So, perhaps the correct answer is given, but it's not through cheating. So, the correct answer could have come from either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but that's not entirely accurate because the correct answer could have come from any of them. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is worded, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not via cheating. So, if the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, that's acceptable. If it's given by Roger, that's via cheating, which we don't want. So, the correct answer could have been given by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. But wait, that's not correct because if the correct answer is given by Roger, then the overall answer is correct, but via cheating. So, the scenario we're interested in is when the correct answer is given, but not via Roger. So, the correct answer must be given by Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer. But wait, no, because the correct answer could be given by any of them, including Roger. But in our desired case, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter. So, perhaps the probability we want is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is not correct. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was via cheating, which we want to exclude.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the event we're interested in is: (Alan correct OR Peter correct) AND Roger incorrect.\n\nBecause if either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is not, then the correct answer is given, but not via cheating.\n\nAlternatively, if Roger is correct, then the correct answer is via cheating, which we don't want. So, the correct answer must come from Alan or Peter, and Roger must be incorrect.\n\nSo, the probability we need is P(Alan correct OR Peter correct) AND Roger incorrect.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the correct answer could be given by more than one person. But the question is about the correct answer being given, regardless of who else got it right. So, the correct answer is achieved if any of them got it right, but we want to exclude cases where Roger was the one who got it right. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether the others got it right. So, perhaps the probability is: the correct answer is achieved, and it's not because Roger answered correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as the correct answer is given, but Roger's answer is incorrect. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter. So, the overall probability is the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nHmm, perhaps that's the way to go.\n\nSo, let's model it as: the correct answer is achieved via either Alan or Peter, and Roger did not answer correctly. So, the probability we need is P(Alan correct OR Peter correct) AND Roger incorrect.\n\nWait, but that's not entirely accurate because the correct answer could be given by any of them, including Roger. So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the probability that the correct answer is given, but it's not via Roger. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the entire scenario. The question is answered correctly if at least one of the three got it right. But we want the probability that the correct answer was achieved without cheating, i.e., without Roger's contribution. So, the correct answer must have been achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer.\n\nWait, but if the correct answer is achieved by any of them, including Roger, but we want the correct answer to be achieved without Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo, the probability we're looking for is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, no, because if both Alan and Peter are correct, that's fine. But if Roger is correct, regardless of whether others are correct, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which we don't want. So, we need to find the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but not via Roger.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved, minus the probability that the correct answer is achieved via Roger. So, P(correct) - P(correct via Roger).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to model the scenarios where the correct answer is achieved, but Roger didn't contribute to it. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo, let's compute that.\n\nFirst, let's compute the probability that Roger is incorrect. Roger's probability of being incorrect is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nNext, the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct. But this is the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct. So, P(A correct OR P correct) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A)P(P), since Alan and Peter's answers are independent.\n\nSo, P(A) = 1/5, P(P) =5/6.\n\nSo, P(A or P) = 1/5 +5/6 - (1/5)(5/6) = let's compute this.\n\n1/5 is 6/30, 5/6 is 25/30.\n\nSo, 6/30 +25/30 =31/30. But wait, that's more than 1. That can't be right.\n\nAh, because I forgot to subtract the product. So, 6/30 +25/30 =31/30, then minus (1/5)(5/6) = (1*5)/(5*6) )=5/30 =1/6.\n\nSo, 31/30 -1/6 = 31/30 -5/30 =26/30 =13/15.\n\nSo, the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct is 13/15.\n\nWait, but that can't be. Because 1/5 is 0.2, 5/6 is ~0.833, so the chance that either is correct is 0.2 +0.833 -0.2*0.833 \u2248 0.2 +0.833 -0.1666 \u22480.8664, which is approximately 13/15 (since 13/15 \u22480.8667). So that seems correct.\n\nSo, now, the probability that Roger is incorrect is 1/3.\n\nSo, the combined probability is P(A or P correct) * P(Roger incorrect) = (13/15) * (1/3) =13/(45).\n\nWait, but wait a second. Because if the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and Roger is incorrect, then the correct answer is achieved without cheating. So, the probability is 13/45.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, E is 13/45, so that's an option.\n\nBut wait, wait. Another approach: the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given, but not because of Roger. So, the correct answer must have come from Alan or Peter. So, the probability is the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and that at least one of them is correct, regardless of Roger.\n\nWait, but how does that play out? Because if the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not Roger, then the overall correct answer is achieved.\n\nBut perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly, and that Roger is incorrect. So, the correct answer is achieved, and it's not via Roger.\n\nSo, P(correct) = 1 - P(all incorrect).\n\nWait, no. Because the correct answer is given if at least one of them is correct. So, P(correct) is 1 - P(all incorrect).\n\nBut then, P(not via cheating) would be P(correct) minus P(correct via cheating).\n\nWait, P(correct via cheating) is the probability that Roger is correct, and the others are incorrect.\n\nWait, no, because the correct answer could be given by anyone. So, the correct answer is given via cheating if Roger is correct, regardless of whether others are correct. So, the probability that the correct answer is given via cheating is P(Roger correct) multiplied by the probability that Alan and Peter are incorrect.\n\nWait, but that's not accurate because the correct answer is given if any of them is correct, so if Roger is correct, then the correct answer is given via cheating.\n\nSo, the probability that the correct answer is given via cheating is P(Roger correct) multiplied by the probability that Alan and Peter are incorrect. Because if Roger is correct, regardless of others, the correct answer is via cheating.\n\nSo, let's compute that.\n\nP(Roger correct) =2/3.\n\nP(Alan incorrect) =4/5.\n\nP(Peter incorrect)=1 -5/6=1/6.\n\nSo, P(Roger correct and Alan incorrect and Peter incorrect) = (2/3) * (4/5) * (1/6) = let's compute that.\n\n2*4*1=8, denominator 3*5*6=90.\n\nSo, 8/90 =4/45.\n\nSo, the probability that the correct answer is given via cheating is 4/45.\n\nThen, the total probability that the correct answer is given is P(correct) =1 - P(all incorrect).\n\nP(all incorrect) = P(A incorrect) * P(R incorrect) * P(P incorrect) = (4/5)*(1/3)*(1/6) = (4*1*1)/(5*3*6) =4/90 =2/45.\n\nSo, P(correct) =1 -2/45 =43/45.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because if each has a probability of being correct, their individual probabilities can't add up to more than 1. Wait, but when considering all three, the correct answer is given if any is correct, so the probability of correct is higher.\n\nWait, but let's compute it correctly.\n\nP(correct) = 1 - P(all incorrect) = 1 - (4/5)*(1/3)*(1/6).\n\nSo, 4/5 *1/3 =4/15, 4/15 *1/6=4/(90)=2/45.\n\nSo, 1-2/45=43/45.\n\nSo, the total probability that the correct answer is given is 43/45.\n\nThen, the probability that the correct answer is given via cheating is 4/45.\n\nSo, the probability that the correct answer is given but not via cheating is P(correct) - P(correct via cheating) =43/45 -4/45=39/45=13/15.\n\nWait, but wait, that's 13/15, which is option E is 13/45. Hmm, that's not matching. So, perhaps I made a mistake in this approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it differently.\n\nThe problem is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, that is, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not via Roger.\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the probability is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly right because if both Alan and Peter are correct, and Roger is incorrect, then the correct answer is achieved by Alan and/or Peter, which is acceptable.\n\nSo, the probability we're looking for is P(A correct OR P correct) AND R incorrect.\n\nWhich is equal to [P(A correct) + P(P correct) - P(A and P correct)] * P(R incorrect).\n\nSo, let's compute this.\n\nP(A correct) =1/5.\n\nP(P correct)=5/6.\n\nP(A correct and P correct)= (1/5)(5/6)=1/6.\n\nSo, P(A or P correct)=1/5 +5/6 -1/6 = (6/30 +25/30 -5/30)= (6+25-5)/30=26/30=13/15.\n\nThen, P(R incorrect)=1-2/3=1/3.\n\nSo, the combined probability is (13/15) * (1/3)=13/45.\n\nSo, the answer is 13/45, which is option E.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about P(correct) being 43/45, and subtracting the 4/45 via cheating, that gave me 39/45, which is 13/15. But that's different from 13/45.\n\nHmm, where is the confusion here?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach. Let me think again.\n\nIf I compute the probability that the correct answer is given, which is 43/45, and then subtract the probability that it's given via cheating (4/45), then I get 43/45 -4/45=39/45=13/15. But that would be the probability that the correct answer is given, and it's not via cheating.\n\nBut according to the other approach, the probability is 13/45.\n\nWhich is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from the interpretation of the problem.\n\nThe question is: What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved, and it's not via cheating.\n\nWhich could be rephrased as: the correct answer is achieved, and it was not achieved via Roger's cheating.\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether others also achieved it.\n\nSo, the probability is the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and that Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo, the correct approach is P(A correct OR P correct) AND R incorrect.\n\nWhich is (13/15) * (1/3) =13/45.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 13/45, which is option E.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm this with another approach.\n\nAnother way: the correct answer is given, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and Roger is not correct.\n\nSo, the event is (A correct OR P correct) AND R incorrect.\n\nSo, compute this.\n\nP(A correct OR P correct) is 13/15, as before.\n\nP(R incorrect)=1/3.\n\nBut since A, R, and P are independent, the joint probability is (13/15) * (1/3) =13/45.\n\nSo, that's the correct probability.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be E)13/45.\n",

So, the event we're interested in is: (Alan correct OR Peter correct) AND Roger incorrect.\n\nBecause if either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is not, then the correct answer is given, but not via cheating.\n\nAlternatively, if Roger is correct, then the correct answer is via cheating, which we don't want. So, the correct answer must come from Alan or Peter, and Roger must be incorrect.\n\nSo, the probability we need is P(Alan correct OR Peter correct) AND Roger incorrect.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the correct answer could be given by more than one person. But the question is about the correct answer being given, regardless of who else got it right. So, the correct answer is achieved if any of them got it right, but we want to exclude cases where Roger was the one who got it right. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether the others got it right. So, perhaps the probability is: the correct answer is achieved, and it's not because Roger answered correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as the correct answer is given, but Roger's answer is incorrect. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter. So, the overall probability is the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nHmm, perhaps that's the way to go.\n\nSo, let's model it as: the correct answer is achieved via either Alan or Peter, and Roger did not answer correctly. So, the probability we need is P(Alan correct OR Peter correct) AND Roger incorrect.\n\nWait, but that's not entirely accurate because the correct answer could be given by any of them, including Roger. So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the probability that the correct answer is given, but it's not via Roger. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the entire scenario. The question is answered correctly if at least one of the three got it right. But we want the probability that the correct answer was achieved without cheating, i.e., without Roger's contribution. So, the correct answer must have been achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer.\n\nWait, but if the correct answer is achieved by any of them, including Roger, but we want the correct answer to be achieved without Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo, the probability we're looking for is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, no, because if both Alan and Peter are correct, that's fine. But if Roger is correct, regardless of whether others are correct, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which we don't want. So, we need to find the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but not via Roger.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved, minus the probability that the correct answer is achieved via Roger. So, P(correct) - P(correct via Roger).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to model the scenarios where the correct answer is achieved, but Roger didn't contribute to it. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo, let's compute that.\n\nFirst, let's compute the probability that Roger is incorrect. Roger's probability of being incorrect is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nNext, the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct. But this is the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct. So, P(A correct OR P correct) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A)P(P), since Alan and Peter's answers are independent.\n\nSo, P(A) = 1/5, P(P) =5/6.\n\nSo, P(A or P) = 1/5 +5/6 - (1/5)(5/6) = let's compute this.\n\n1/5 is 6/30, 5/6 is 25/30.\n\nSo, 6/30 +25/30 =31/30. But wait, that's more than 1. That can't be right.\n\nAh, because I forgot to subtract the product. So, 6/30 +25/30 =31/30, then minus (1/5)(5/6) = (1*5)/(5*6) )=5/30 =1/6.\n\nSo, 31/30 -1/6 = 31/30 -5/30 =26/30 =13/15.\n\nSo, the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct is 13/15.\n\nWait, but that can't be. Because 1/5 is 0.2, 5/6 is ~0.833, so the chance that either is correct is 0.2 +0.833 -0.2*0.833 \u2248 0.2 +0.833 -0.1666 \u22480.8664, which is approximately 13/15 (since 13/15 \u22480.8667). So that seems correct.\n\nSo, now, the probability that Roger is incorrect is 1/3.\n\nSo, the combined probability is P(A or P correct) * P(Roger incorrect) = (13/15) * (1/3) =13/(45).\n\nWait, but wait a second. Because if the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and Roger is incorrect, then the correct answer is achieved without cheating. So, the probability is 13/45.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, E is 13/45, so that's an option.\n\nBut wait, wait. Another approach: the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given, but not because of Roger. So, the correct answer must have come from Alan or Peter. So, the probability is the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and that at least one of them is correct, regardless of Roger.\n\nWait, but how does that play out? Because if the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not Roger, then the overall correct answer is achieved.\n\nBut perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly, and that Roger is incorrect. So, the correct answer is achieved, and it's not via Roger.\n\nSo, P(correct) = 1 - P(all incorrect).\n\nWait, no. Because the correct answer is given if at least one of them is correct. So, P(correct) is 1 - P(all incorrect).\n\nBut then, P(not via cheating) would be P(correct) minus P(correct via cheating).\n\nWait, P(correct via cheating) is the probability that Roger is correct, and the others are incorrect.\n\nWait, no, because the correct answer could be given by anyone. So, the correct answer is given via cheating if Roger is correct, regardless of whether others are correct. So, the probability that the correct answer is given via cheating is P(Roger correct) multiplied by the probability that Alan and Peter are incorrect.\n\nWait, but that's not accurate because the correct answer is given if any of them is correct, so if Roger is correct, then the correct answer is given via cheating.\n\nSo, the probability that the correct answer is given via cheating is P(Roger correct) multiplied by the probability that Alan and Peter are incorrect. Because if Roger is correct, regardless of others, the correct answer is via cheating.\n\nSo, let's compute that.\n\nP(Roger correct) =2/3.\n\nP(Alan incorrect) =4/5.\n\nP(Peter incorrect)=1 -5/6=1/6.\n\nSo, P(Roger correct and Alan incorrect and Peter incorrect) = (2/3) * (4/5) * (1/6) = let's compute that.\n\n2*4*1=8, denominator 3*5*6=90.\n\nSo, 8/90 =4/45.\n\nSo, the probability that the correct answer is given via cheating is 4/45.\n\nThen, the total probability that the correct answer is given is P(correct) =1 - P(all incorrect).\n\nP(all incorrect) = P(A incorrect) * P(R incorrect) * P(P incorrect) = (4/5)*(1/3)*(1/6) = (4*1*1)/(5*3*6) =4/90 =2/45.\n\nSo, P(correct) =1 -2/45 =43/45.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because if each has a probability of being correct, their individual probabilities can't add up to more than 1. Wait, but when considering all three, the correct answer is given if any is correct, so the probability of correct is higher.\n\nWait, but let's compute it correctly.\n\nP(correct) = 1 - P(all incorrect) = 1 - (4/5)*(1/3)*(1/6).\n\nSo, 4/5 *1/3 =4/15, 4/15 *1/6=4/(90)=2/45.\n\nSo, 1-2/45=43/45.\n\nSo, the total probability that the correct answer is given is 43/45.\n\nThen, the probability that the correct answer is given via cheating is 4/45.\n\nSo, the probability that the correct answer is given but not via cheating is P(correct) - P(correct via cheating) =43/45 -4/45=39/45=13/15.\n\nWait, but wait, that's 13/15, which is option E is 13/45. Hmm, that's not matching. So, perhaps I made a mistake in this approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it differently.\n\nThe problem is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, that is, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not via Roger.\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the probability is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly right because if both Alan and Peter are correct, and Roger is incorrect, then the correct answer is achieved by Alan and/or Peter, which is acceptable.\n\nSo, the probability we're looking for is P(A correct OR P correct) AND R incorrect.\n\nWhich is equal to [P(A correct) + P(P correct) - P(A and P correct)] * P(R incorrect).\n\nSo, let's compute this.\n\nP(A correct) =1/5.\n\nP(P correct)=5/6.\n\nP(A correct and P correct)= (1/5)(5/6)=1/6.\n\nSo, P(A or P correct)=1/5 +5/6 -1/6 = (6/30 +25/30 -5/30)= (6+25-5)/30=26/30=13/15.\n\nThen, P(R incorrect)=1-2/3=1/3.\n\nSo, the combined probability is (13/15) * (1/3)=13/45.\n\nSo, the answer is 13/45, which is option E.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about P(correct) being 43/45, and subtracting the 4/45 via cheating, that gave me 39/45, which is 13/15. But that's different from 13/45.\n\nHmm, where is the confusion here?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach. Let me think again.\n\nIf I compute the probability that the correct answer is given, which is 43/45, and then subtract the probability that it's given via cheating (4/45), then I get 43/45 -4/45=39/45=13/15. But that would be the probability that the correct answer is given, and it's not via cheating.\n\nBut according to the other approach, the probability is 13/45.\n\nWhich is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from the interpretation of the problem.\n\nThe question is: What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved, and it's not via cheating.\n\nWhich could be rephrased as: the correct answer is achieved, and it was not achieved via Roger's cheating.\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether others also achieved it.\n\nSo, the probability is the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and that Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo, the correct approach is P(A correct OR P correct) AND R incorrect.\n\nWhich is (13/15) * (1/3) =13/45.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 13/45, which is option E.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm this with another approach.\n\nAnother way: the correct answer is given, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and Roger is not correct.\n\nSo, the event is (A correct OR P correct) AND R incorrect.\n\nSo, compute this.\n\nP(A correct OR P correct) is 13/15, as before.\n\nP(R incorrect)=1/3.\n\nBut since A, R, and P are independent, the joint probability is (13/15) * (1/3) =13/45.\n\nSo, that's the correct probability.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be E)13/45.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. This means the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and Roger does not contribute to the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Individual probabilities\n- **Alan's probability of being correct**: \\( P(A) = \\frac{1}{5} \\)\n- **Roger's probability of being correct (via cheating)**: \\( P(R) = \\frac{2}{3} \\)\n- **Peter's probability of being correct**: \\( P(P) = \\frac{5}{6} \\)\n\n### Step 2: Probability that Roger is incorrect\nSince Roger's probability of being correct is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\), the probability that he is incorrect is:\n\\[\nP(R \\text{ incorrect}) = 1 - P(R) = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Probability that Alan or Peter is correct\nThe probability that either Alan or Peter is correct is calculated as:\n\\[\nP(A \\text{ or } P \\text{ correct}) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A)P(P)\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\nP(A \\text{ or } P \\text{ correct}) = \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{5}{6} - \\left(\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{5}{6}\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\nP(A \\text{ or } P \\text{ correct}) = \\frac{6}{30} + \\frac{25}{30} - \\frac{5}{30}\n\\]\n\\[\nP(A \\text{ or } P \\text{ correct}) = \\frac{26}{30} = \\frac{13}{15}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Combined probability\nThe probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is the probability that Alan or Peter is correct and Roger is incorrect.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this probability problem. Let me read it again.\n\nSo, three friends: Alan, Roger, and Peter. Each has their own way of answering a question, and each has a different probability of being correct. The question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating. Hmm, so I need to find the probability that the correct answer is given, but Roger didn't cheat to get it. Because if Roger cheats and gets it right, that's not counted here.\n\nWait, wait. Wait. Let me think. The way the question is phrased is a bit tricky. The problem is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, that would mean the correct answer was achieved either by Alan guessing or by Peter doing the calculations. Because if Roger cheated and got it right, that's cheating, so we don't count that scenario. So we're looking for the cases where the answer is correct, but it's not because of cheating.\n\nWait, no. Wait a second. Let me make sure. The question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer could have been achieved either by Alan guessing correctly or by Peter doing it correctly. But Roger's correct answer comes via cheating, so we don't want that.\n\nBut wait, how is the question structured? Are the three friends each answering independently, or is it about the question being answered by someone, and we want to exclude the cases where it's answered via cheating?\n\nSo, perhaps the setup is that each of them attempts the question, and the question is whether the correct answer is given. But the way the question is phrased, it's about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, we need to compute the probability that the question is correct, but the correct answer was not obtained through cheating (i.e., Roger's method).\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: think of all possible ways the question can be answered correctly, and then subtract the cases where it's correct because of cheating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the events are that either Alan or Peter got it right, but not Roger. Wait, but the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, not by cheating. So perhaps the event is that either Alan or Peter got it correct, but Roger did not. Wait, no. Because if all three answer, but the correct answer is given by someone, but if Roger's way is cheating, then the correct answer could be via cheating or not.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me structure this step by step.\n\nEach of the three friends answers the question. We need to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given, but it's not because of Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, but how do the three of them contribute to the question being answered correctly? I think the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, regardless of who got it right, but not through cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is whether the question is answered correctly in a way that doesn't involve cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved either by Alan guessing correctly or by Peter doing it correctly. So, we're looking for the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, but Roger is not.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Because if all three answer, and the correct answer is given by someone, then it's correct regardless of how. But the question is about the correct answer being achieved without cheating.\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the probability that the correct answer is given, but that correct answer was not achieved through cheating. So, that would be the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of Roger's result.\n\nWait, but then what about if both Alan and Peter are correct? Or if none are correct?\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to model this as a probability problem.\n\nLet me define the events:\n\nA: Alan answers correctly. Probability P(A) = 1/5.\n\nR: Roger answers correctly. P(R) = 2/3.\n\nP: Peter answers correctly. P(P) = 5/6.\n\nThe question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. Because if Roger is the one who got it right via cheating, then that's the cheating scenario we're excluding.\n\nWait, but perhaps the correct answer is given by any of them, but we want the cases where the correct answer is given by someone who didn't cheat. So, the correct answer could be given by Alan, Peter, or both. But if Roger got it right via cheating, that's the scenario we're excluding.\n\nWait, but the way the question is phrased is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?\" So, the correct answer is achieved without cheating. So, the correct answer is either Alan's (by guessing) or Peter's (by calculation), but not Roger's (who cheated).\n\nWait, but perhaps the question is whether the correct answer was achieved by someone who didn't cheat. So, it's possible that more than one person answered correctly, but as long as at least one of them (non-cheaters) got it right, then the question is considered answered correctly without cheating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the scenario where the correct answer is given, but the person who answered it didn't cheat. So, the correct answer could be from Alan or Peter, but not from Roger.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is given, and the method used to get it wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the correct answer could be achieved by either Alan, Peter, or both. But the cases where Roger is the one who answered correctly via cheating are excluded.\n\nBut wait, in reality, the question is whether the correct answer is given, regardless of who. But we want to find the probability that the correct answer is given, but it's not because of cheating. So, the correct answer is given by someone who isn't cheating. So, if any of Alan or Peter answered correctly, the question is considered answered correctly without cheating.\n\nWait, but what if only Roger got it right via cheating? Then the question is correctly answered, but via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nSo, the scenario we're interested in is that the question is answered correctly, but the correct answer was given by Alan or Peter. So, the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly correct because all three are answering the question. So, perhaps the correct answer is given by at least one of them, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger got it right.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but that may not capture all scenarios. Let me think again.\n\nThe question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter. So, the question is answered correctly if at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of what Roger does.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is answered correctly if at least one of the three is correct, but we need to exclude the cases where the correct answer is achieved via cheating (i.e., by Roger). So, the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: The question is answered correctly if any of the three is correct. But we need to find the probability that the correct answer was given without cheating, which is when either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of whether Roger is correct.\n\nWait, but I think the question is asking for the probability that the correct answer is given, and that correct answer was not obtained through cheating. So, that would be the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is not correct.\n\nWait, that's a possibility. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was given via cheating, which we're excluding. So, the scenario is that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, no. Because if the question is answered correctly by, say, both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer was given via cheating (Roger), so it's not what we're looking for. But if it's answered correctly by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's result, then the correct answer was given without cheating.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again. Let's model the events.\n\nLet me think of the problem as: the question is answered correctly if at least one of the three is correct. But we want the probability that the correct answer was given without cheating, meaning that the correct answer was given by Alan or Peter. So, even if Roger is correct, but the correct answer is also given by Alan or Peter, then it's counted.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly, and that the correct answer was achieved without cheating. So, the correct answer was achieved by Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but how do we model that? Because if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Peter, then it's definitely without cheating. But if the correct answer is given only by Roger, then it's via cheating and we don't count that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is the correct one, and we want to know the probability that it was answered by Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, maybe the question is that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer. So, the correct answer is achieved via guessing (Alan) or via calculation (Peter), but not via cheating (Roger). So, the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but that's not considering the cases where multiple people answer correctly. For example, if both Alan and Roger are correct, then the correct answer was given via cheating (Roger), so it shouldn't be counted. But if Alan is correct, then it's via guessing and should be counted.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the union of the events where Alan is correct or Peter is correct, but not Roger.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right because the events are not independent in that sense.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's correctness. Because if either Alan or Peter is correct, then the question is answered correctly without cheating. But if the correct answer is given only by Roger, then it's via cheating and not counted.\n\nWait, so the probability we're looking for is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, or both. Because in those cases, the correct answer is given without cheating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly (by at least one of the three) but not via cheating. So, that would be the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, but not only by Roger.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is P(Alan correct OR Peter correct) minus P(Alan correct AND Peter correct AND Roger incorrect). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly, and that the correct answer was given by someone who didn't cheat. So, that would be the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly, regardless of whether Roger did.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, the correct answer is given, but it's not via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer could have been given by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer. So, the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, but we don't care about Roger.\n\nWait, but that's not considering the cases where Roger is correct. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was given via cheating, which we're excluding. So, the correct scenario is when the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's result.\n\nWait, but that can't be. Because if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Roger, then it's via cheating. So, we need to exclude the cases where the correct answer is given via cheating (i.e., Roger is correct) and only consider the cases where the correct answer is given via Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger. So, the probability that either Alan is correct or Peter is correct, regardless of whether Roger is correct.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the correct answer being given, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether it's also given by Roger. So, the correct approach is to compute the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of Roger.\n\nSo, the probability would be P(A correct) + P(P correct) - P(A and P correct). Because that's the inclusion-exclusion principle for the union of two events.\n\nSo, P(A) = 1/5, P(P) =5/6.\n\nP(A and P) = P(A) * P(P), since they're independent events. So, 1/5 *5/6 = 1/6.\n\nSo, P(A \u222a P) = 1/5 +5/6 -1/6 = (6/30 +25/30 -5/30) = 26/30 =13/15.\n\nWait, but that's the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of Roger. So, that's the probability that the question is answered correctly via non-cheating methods. But wait, what about Roger's correctness? Because the question is about the question being answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but it's possible that Roger is also correct. But regardless, the correct answer is given via non-cheating.\n\nWait, but the way the question is phrased is \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, the correct answer is given, but it's not through Roger's cheating. So, if the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, that's fine. But if it's given by Roger, that's not counted.\n\nSo, the total probability is the probability that the question is answered correctly via Alan or Peter, regardless of whether it's also answered by Roger.\n\nSo, the formula would be P(A \u222a P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A and P) = 1/5 +5/6 - (1/5 *5/6) = 1/5 +5/6 -1/6.\n\nCalculating:\n\n1/5 is 6/30.\n\n5/6 is 25/30.\n\nSo, 6/30 +25/30 = 31/30. Then subtract 5/30 (because 1/5 *5/6 is 1/6 which is 5/30).\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, 1/5 *5/6 is (1*5)/(5*6) )= 5/(30) = 1/6.\n\nSo, P(A \u222a P) = (6/30) + (25/30) - (5/30) )= 26/30 = 13/15.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 13/15 is about 0.8667, which is higher than the individual probabilities. But the question is, is that the correct approach?\n\nBut wait, the problem is that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer could have been given by Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger did. So, the probability that the correct answer is given via Alan or Peter is P(A \u222a P) = 13/15.\n\nBut that would include cases where Roger also got it right via cheating, which would mean that the correct answer was given via cheating as well. But the question is about the correct answer being given without cheating. So, perhaps we need to exclude the cases where the correct answer is given via cheating.\n\nWait, but that's getting a bit tangled. Let me think again.\n\nThe correct answer is given if at least one of them answers correctly. But we need to find the probability that the correct answer was given without cheating, which implies that the correct answer was given by Alan or Peter. So, the question is answered correctly via Alan or Peter, regardless of whether it's also correct via Roger.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u222a P) = 13/15.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options given:\n\nOptions are A)1/18, B)1/9, C)23/90, D)5/18, E)13/45.\n\nHmm, 13/15 is not among the options. So, perhaps my approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?\n\nSo, the correct answer is given, but it's not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, and not by Roger. So, the correct answer is given by at least one of Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nWait, but that's not possible because if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Roger, then it's via cheating. So, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case because the correct answer could be given by both Alan and Peter, and not by Roger. So, the correct answer is given via non-cheating methods.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the probability that the correct answer is given, and that it was given without cheating. That is, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nWait, but how to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is given by at least one of Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the formula would be P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR )\n\nBecause we want the correct answer to be given (A or P) and not given by Roger (\u00acR).\n\nSo, we can compute this as:\n\nP(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR | A \u2228 P) ?\n\nWait, no, because events are independent. So, perhaps it's P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR).\n\nBut wait, if A and P are independent of R, which they are, because each person's correctness is independent.\n\nSo, the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter is P(A \u2228 P) = 13/15, as before.\n\nThe probability that the correct answer is not given by Roger is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nSo, the combined probability would be P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR) = (13/15) * (1/3) )= 13/45.\n\nWait, that's option E.\n\nBut let me think again: is that correct? Because if the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger, then the question is answered correctly via non-cheating. But wait, if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Peter, then that's fine. But if the correct answer is given by Roger, then we're excluding that.\n\nWait, no. Because the formula P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR) assumes that whether Roger is correct is independent of whether Alan or Peter is correct. But in reality, the correct answer is the same for all, so if Alan is correct, then the correct answer is the same as what Roger and Peter have.\n\nWait, no, each of them is answering the same question, so their correctness is dependent on the same underlying correct answer. So, perhaps the events are not independent.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me model this correctly.\n\nEach of them is answering the same question, so the correct answer is the same for all. So, if Alan is correct, then the correct answer is what he said, and that's the same correct answer that Roger and Peter are trying to get.\n\nSo, the correctness of each is independent, but the correct answer is the same. So, perhaps the events are independent.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think. The probability that Alan is correct is 1/5, regardless of what the others do. Similarly for Roger and Peter.\n\nSo, each person's correctness is independent.\n\nSo, the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, no. Because if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Peter, that's a correct answer without cheating. If it's given by Roger, that's via cheating.\n\nSo, the scenario we want is that the correct answer is given by at least one of Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Peter, then the question is correctly answered via non-cheating methods, regardless of Roger. So, the correct approach is to compute the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is not correct.\n\nWait, no. Because the question is answered correctly if any of them is correct. So, the correct answer is given, but we want to know the probability that it's given without cheating. So, the correct answer is given via Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct.\n\nWait, I'm getting myself into a loop. Let me try a different approach.\n\nThe correct answer is given by someone. The possible ways:\n\n1. Alan correct, Roger incorrect, Peter incorrect.\n\n2. Peter correct, Roger incorrect, Alan incorrect.\n\n3. Both Alan and Peter correct, Roger incorrect.\n\n4. Alan correct, Peter correct, Roger correct.\n\nWait, but in these cases, if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was given via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nSo, the scenarios we want are those where the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct.\n\nWait, but that can't be, because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was given via cheating. So, the correct answer is given by someone, but we don't want it to be via cheating.\n\nSo, the correct answer is given via Alan or Peter. So, the probability is the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger does.\n\nWait, but that's not considering the cases where the correct answer is given by both Alan and Peter, which is allowed, but not by Roger.\n\nSo, perhaps the formula is P(A \u2228 P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A \u2227 P) = 1/5 +5/6 - (1/5 *5/6) = 1/5 +5/6 -1/6 = 1/5 +4/6 = 1/5 + 2/3 = (3/15 + 10/15) = 13/15.\n\nBut the options don't have 13/15. The options have E)13/45.\n\nHmm, that suggests that my approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, which would be the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger.\n\nWait, but that's a bit conflicting. Let me model it as:\n\nThe correct answer is given if any of Alan, Roger, or Peter is correct. But we want the correct answer to be given by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nWait, no. Because the correct answer is given if any of them is correct. So, the question is correctly answered if at least one of them is correct. But among these cases, the ones where the correct answer was given via cheating (Roger) are excluded.\n\nSo, the probability we want is the probability that the correct answer is given, and it was given by someone who didn't cheat (Alan or Peter).\n\nSo, the formula is P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ). Because we want the correct answer to be given (A or P) and not given by Roger (\u00acR).\n\nWait, but since the correctness of each is independent, we can expand this.\n\nP( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR) ?\n\nWait, no, because A, P, and R are independent, but the events are not independent. Because if A is correct, then R could be correct or not. Wait, no, the correctness is independent.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute this as the probability that either Alan is correct and Roger is not, or Peter is correct and Roger is not. But we have to consider overlapping cases where both Alan and Peter are correct, and Roger is not.\n\nSo, the formula would be:\n\nP( (A \u2227 \u00acR) \u2228 (P \u2227 \u00acR) )\n\nWhich is equal to P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR) since A and P are independent of R.\n\nWait, because A and P are independent of R, so:\n\nP( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR).\n\nBecause A, P, and R are independent events, the probability that R is not correct is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nSo, P(A \u2228 P) is 13/15, as calculated earlier. So, 13/15 * 1/3 = 13/45.\n\nWhich is option E.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Because if all three are correct, then the correct answer was given by all of them, including Roger, which we don't want. So, perhaps the formula is the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger.\n\nSo, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and Roger is not correct.\n\nSo, the formula would be:\n\nP( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR).\n\nBecause A, P, R are independent.\n\nSo, P(A \u2228 P) = 1/5 +5/6 - (1/5 *5/6) = 1/5 +5/6 -1/6 = 1/5 +4/6 = 1/5 + 2/3 = 13/15.\n\nP(\u00acR) = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nSo, 13/15 * 1/3 = 13/45.\n\nWhich is option E.\n\nSo, the correct answer is E)13/45.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this probability problem. Let me read it again.\n\nSo, three friends: Alan, Roger, and Peter. Each has their own way of answering a question, and each has a different probability of being correct. The question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating. Hmm, so I need to find the probability that the correct answer is given, but Roger didn't cheat to get it. Because if Roger cheats and gets it right, that's not counted here.\n\nWait, wait. Wait. Let me think. The way the question is phrased is a bit tricky. The problem is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, that would mean the correct answer was achieved either by Alan guessing or by Peter doing the calculations. Because if Roger cheated and got it right, that's cheating, so we don't count that scenario. So we're looking for the cases where the answer is correct, but it's not because of cheating.\n\nWait, no. Wait a second. Let me make sure. The question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer could have been achieved either by Alan guessing correctly or by Peter doing it correctly. But Roger's correct answer comes via cheating, so we don't want that.\n\nBut wait, how is the question structured? Are the three friends each answering independently, or is it about the question being answered by someone, and we want to exclude the cases where it's answered via cheating?\n\nSo, perhaps the setup is that each of them attempts the question, and the question is whether the correct answer is given. But the way the question is phrased, it's about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, we need to compute the probability that the question is correct, but the correct answer was not obtained through cheating (i.e., Roger's method).\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: think of all possible ways the question can be answered correctly, and then subtract the cases where it's correct because of cheating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the events are that either Alan or Peter got it right, but not Roger. Wait, but the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, not by cheating. So perhaps the event is that either Alan or Peter got it correct, but Roger did not. Wait, no. Because if all three answer, but the correct answer is given by someone, but if Roger's way is cheating, then the correct answer could be via cheating or not.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me structure this step by step.\n\nEach of the three friends answers the question. We need to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given, but it's not because of Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, but how do the three of them contribute to the question being answered correctly? I think the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, regardless of who got it right, but not through cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is whether the question is answered correctly in a way that doesn't involve cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved either by Alan guessing correctly or by Peter doing it correctly. So, we're looking for the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, but Roger is not.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Because if all three answer, and the correct answer is given by someone, then it's correct regardless of how. But the question is about the correct answer being achieved without cheating.\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the probability that the correct answer is given, but that correct answer was not achieved through cheating. So, that would be the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of Roger's result.\n\nWait, but then what about if both Alan and Peter are correct? Or if none are correct?\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to model this as a probability problem.\n\nLet me define the events:\n\nA: Alan answers correctly. Probability P(A) = 1/5.\n\nR: Roger answers correctly. P(R) = 2/3.\n\nP: Peter answers correctly. P(P) = 5/6.\n\nThe question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. Because if Roger is the one who got it right via cheating, then that's the cheating scenario we're excluding.\n\nWait, but perhaps the correct answer is given by any of them, but we want the cases where the correct answer is given by someone who didn't cheat. So, the correct answer could be given by Alan, Peter, or both. But if Roger got it right via cheating, that's the scenario we're excluding.\n\nWait, but the way the question is phrased is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?\" So, the correct answer is achieved without cheating. So, the correct answer is either Alan's (by guessing) or Peter's (by calculation), but not Roger's (who cheated).\n\nWait, but perhaps the question is whether the correct answer was achieved by someone who didn't cheat. So, it's possible that more than one person answered correctly, but as long as at least one of them (non-cheaters) got it right, then the question is considered answered correctly without cheating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the scenario where the correct answer is given, but the person who answered it didn't cheat. So, the correct answer could be from Alan or Peter, but not from Roger.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is given, and the method used to get it wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the correct answer could be achieved by either Alan, Peter, or both. But the cases where Roger is the one who answered correctly via cheating are excluded.\n\nBut wait, in reality, the question is whether the correct answer is given, regardless of who. But we want to find the probability that the correct answer is given, but it's not because of cheating. So, the correct answer is given by someone who isn't cheating. So, if any of Alan or Peter answered correctly, the question is considered answered correctly without cheating.\n\nWait, but what if only Roger got it right via cheating? Then the question is correctly answered, but via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nSo, the scenario we're interested in is that the question is answered correctly, but the correct answer was given by Alan or Peter. So, the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly correct because all three are answering the question. So, perhaps the correct answer is given by at least one of them, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger got it right.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but that may not capture all scenarios. Let me think again.\n\nThe question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter. So, the question is answered correctly if at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of what Roger does.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is answered correctly if at least one of the three is correct, but we need to exclude the cases where the correct answer is achieved via cheating (i.e., by Roger). So, the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: The question is answered correctly if any of the three is correct. But we need to find the probability that the correct answer was given without cheating, which is when either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of whether Roger is correct.\n\nWait, but I think the question is asking for the probability that the correct answer is given, and that correct answer was not obtained through cheating. So, that would be the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is not correct.\n\nWait, that's a possibility. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was given via cheating, which we're excluding. So, the scenario is that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, no. Because if the question is answered correctly by, say, both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer was given via cheating (Roger), so it's not what we're looking for. But if it's answered correctly by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's result, then the correct answer was given without cheating.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again. Let's model the events.\n\nLet me think of the problem as: the question is answered correctly if at least one of the three is correct. But we want the probability that the correct answer was given without cheating, meaning that the correct answer was given by Alan or Peter. So, even if Roger is correct, but the correct answer is also given by Alan or Peter, then it's counted.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly, and that the correct answer was achieved without cheating. So, the correct answer was achieved by Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but how do we model that? Because if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Peter, then it's definitely without cheating. But if the correct answer is given only by Roger, then it's via cheating and we don't count that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is the correct one, and we want to know the probability that it was answered by Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, maybe the question is that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer. So, the correct answer is achieved via guessing (Alan) or via calculation (Peter), but not via cheating (Roger). So, the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but that's not considering the cases where multiple people answer correctly. For example, if both Alan and Roger are correct, then the correct answer was given via cheating (Roger), so it shouldn't be counted. But if Alan is correct, then it's via guessing and should be counted.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the union of the events where Alan is correct or Peter is correct, but not Roger.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right because the events are not independent in that sense.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's correctness. Because if either Alan or Peter is correct, then the question is answered correctly without cheating. But if the correct answer is given only by Roger, then it's via cheating and not counted.\n\nWait, so the probability we're looking for is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, or both. Because in those cases, the correct answer is given without cheating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly (by at least one of the three) but not via cheating. So, that would be the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, but not only by Roger.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is P(Alan correct OR Peter correct) minus P(Alan correct AND Peter correct AND Roger incorrect). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly, and that the correct answer was given by someone who didn't cheat. So, that would be the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly, regardless of whether Roger did.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, the correct answer is given, but it's not via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer could have been given by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer. So, the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, but we don't care about Roger.\n\nWait, but that's not considering the cases where Roger is correct. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was given via cheating, which we're excluding. So, the correct scenario is when the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's result.\n\nWait, but that can't be. Because if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Roger, then it's via cheating. So, we need to exclude the cases where the correct answer is given via cheating (i.e., Roger is correct) and only consider the cases where the correct answer is given via Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger. So, the probability that either Alan is correct or Peter is correct, regardless of whether Roger is correct.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the correct answer being given, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether it's also given by Roger. So, the correct approach is to compute the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of Roger.\n\nSo, the probability would be P(A correct) + P(P correct) - P(A and P correct). Because that's the inclusion-exclusion principle for the union of two events.\n\nSo, P(A) = 1/5, P(P) =5/6.\n\nP(A and P) = P(A) * P(P), since they're independent events. So, 1/5 *5/6 = 1/6.\n\nSo, P(A \u222a P) = 1/5 +5/6 -1/6 = (6/30 +25/30 -5/30) = 26/30 =13/15.\n\nWait, but that's the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of Roger. So, that's the probability that the question is answered correctly via non-cheating methods. But wait, what about Roger's correctness? Because the question is about the question being answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but it's possible that Roger is also correct. But regardless, the correct answer is given via non-cheating.\n\nWait, but the way the question is phrased is \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, the correct answer is given, but it's not through Roger's cheating. So, if the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, that's fine. But if it's given by Roger, that's not counted.\n\nSo, the total probability is the probability that the question is answered correctly via Alan or Peter, regardless of whether it's also answered by Roger.\n\nSo, the formula would be P(A \u222a P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A and P) = 1/5 +5/6 - (1/5 *5/6) = 1/5 +5/6 -1/6.\n\nCalculating:\n\n1/5 is 6/30.\n\n5/6 is 25/30.\n\nSo, 6/30 +25/30 = 31/30. Then subtract 5/30 (because 1/5 *5/6 is 1/6 which is 5/30).\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, 1/5 *5/6 is (1*5)/(5*6) )= 5/(30) = 1/6.\n\nSo, P(A \u222a P) = (6/30) + (25/30) - (5/30) )= 26/30 = 13/15.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 13/15 is about 0.8667, which is higher than the individual probabilities. But the question is, is that the correct approach?\n\nBut wait, the problem is that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer could have been given by Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger did. So, the probability that the correct answer is given via Alan or Peter is P(A \u222a P) = 13/15.\n\nBut that would include cases where Roger also got it right via cheating, which would mean that the correct answer was given via cheating as well. But the question is about the correct answer being given without cheating. So, perhaps we need to exclude the cases where the correct answer is given via cheating.\n\nWait, but that's getting a bit tangled. Let me think again.\n\nThe correct answer is given if at least one of them answers correctly. But we need to find the probability that the correct answer was given without cheating, which implies that the correct answer was given by Alan or Peter. So, the question is answered correctly via Alan or Peter, regardless of whether it's also correct via Roger.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u222a P) = 13/15.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options given:\n\nOptions are A)1/18, B)1/9, C)23/90, D)5/18, E)13/45.\n\nHmm, 13/15 is not among the options. So, perhaps my approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?\n\nSo, the correct answer is given, but it's not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, and not by Roger. So, the correct answer is given by at least one of Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nWait, but that's not possible because if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Roger, then it's via cheating. So, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case because the correct answer could be given by both Alan and Peter, and not by Roger. So, the correct answer is given via non-cheating methods.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the probability that the correct answer is given, and that it was given without cheating. That is, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nWait, but how to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is given by at least one of Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the formula would be P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR )\n\nBecause we want the correct answer to be given (A or P) and not given by Roger (\u00acR).\n\nSo, we can compute this as:\n\nP(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR | A \u2228 P) ?\n\nWait, no, because events are independent. So, perhaps it's P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR).\n\nBut wait, if A and P are independent of R, which they are, because each person's correctness is independent.\n\nSo, the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter is P(A \u2228 P) = 13/15, as before.\n\nThe probability that the correct answer is not given by Roger is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nSo, the combined probability would be P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR) = (13/15) * (1/3) )= 13/45.\n\nWait, that's option E.\n\nBut let me think again: is that correct? Because if the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger, then the question is answered correctly via non-cheating. But wait, if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Peter, then that's fine. But if the correct answer is given by Roger, then we're excluding that.\n\nWait, no. Because the formula P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR) assumes that whether Roger is correct is independent of whether Alan or Peter is correct. But in reality, the correct answer is the same for all, so if Alan is correct, then the correct answer is the same as what Roger and Peter have.\n\nWait, no, each of them is answering the same question, so their correctness is dependent on the same underlying correct answer. So, perhaps the events are not independent.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me model this correctly.\n\nEach of them is answering the same question, so the correct answer is the same for all. So, if Alan is correct, then the correct answer is what he said, and that's the same correct answer that Roger and Peter are trying to get.\n\nSo, the correctness of each is independent, but the correct answer is the same. So, perhaps the events are independent.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think. The probability that Alan is correct is 1/5, regardless of what the others do. Similarly for Roger and Peter.\n\nSo, each person's correctness is independent.\n\nSo, the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, no. Because if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Peter, that's a correct answer without cheating. If it's given by Roger, that's via cheating.\n\nSo, the scenario we want is that the correct answer is given by at least one of Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Peter, then the question is correctly answered via non-cheating methods, regardless of Roger. So, the correct approach is to compute the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is not correct.\n\nWait, no. Because the question is answered correctly if any of them is correct. So, the correct answer is given, but we want to know the probability that it's given without cheating. So, the correct answer is given via Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct.\n\nWait, I'm getting myself into a loop. Let me try a different approach.\n\nThe correct answer is given by someone. The possible ways:\n\n1. Alan correct, Roger incorrect, Peter incorrect.\n\n2. Peter correct, Roger incorrect, Alan incorrect.\n\n3. Both Alan and Peter correct, Roger incorrect.\n\n4. Alan correct, Peter correct, Roger correct.\n\nWait, but in these cases, if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was given via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nSo, the scenarios we want are those where the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct.\n\nWait, but that can't be, because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was given via cheating. So, the correct answer is given by someone, but we don't want it to be via cheating.\n\nSo, the correct answer is given via Alan or Peter. So, the probability is the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger does.\n\nWait, but that's not considering the cases where the correct answer is given by both Alan and Peter, which is allowed, but not by Roger.\n\nSo, perhaps the formula is P(A \u2228 P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A \u2227 P) = 1/5 +5/6 - (1/5 *5/6) = 1/5 +5/6 -1/6 = 1/5 +4/6 = 1/5 + 2/3 = (3/15 + 10/15) = 13/15.\n\nBut the options don't have 13/15. The options have E)13/45.\n\nHmm, that suggests that my approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, which would be the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger.\n\nWait, but that's a bit conflicting. Let me model it as:\n\nThe correct answer is given if any of Alan, Roger, or Peter is correct. But we want the correct answer to be given by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nWait, no. Because the correct answer is given if any of them is correct. So, the question is correctly answered if at least one of them is correct. But among these cases, the ones where the correct answer was given via cheating (Roger) are excluded.\n\nSo, the probability we want is the probability that the correct answer is given, and it was given by someone who didn't cheat (Alan or Peter).\n\nSo, the formula is P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ). Because we want the correct answer to be given (A or P) and not given by Roger (\u00acR).\n\nWait, but since the correctness of each is independent, we can expand this.\n\nP( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR) ?\n\nWait, no, because A, P, and R are independent, but the events are not independent. Because if A is correct, then R could be correct or not. Wait, no, the correctness is independent.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute this as the probability that either Alan is correct and Roger is not, or Peter is correct and Roger is not. But we have to consider overlapping cases where both Alan and Peter are correct, and Roger is not.\n\nSo, the formula would be:\n\nP( (A \u2227 \u00acR) \u2228 (P \u2227 \u00acR) )\n\nWhich is equal to P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR) since A and P are independent of R.\n\nWait, because A and P are independent of R, so:\n\nP( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR).\n\nBecause A, P, and R are independent events, the probability that R is not correct is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nSo, P(A \u2228 P) is 13/15, as calculated earlier. So, 13/15 * 1/3 = 13/45.\n\nWhich is option E.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Because if all three are correct, then the correct answer was given by all of them, including Roger, which we don't want. So, perhaps the formula is the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger.\n\nSo, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and Roger is not correct.\n\nSo, the formula would be:\n\nP( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR).\n\nBecause A, P, R are independent.\n\nSo, P(A \u2228 P) = 1/5 +5/6 - (1/5 *5/6) = 1/5 +5/6 -1/6 = 1/5 +4/6 = 1/5 + 2/3 = 13/15.\n\nP(\u00acR) = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nSo, 13/15 * 1/3 = 13/45.\n\nWhich is option E.\n\nSo, the correct answer is E)13/45.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. This means the correct answer is given by either Alan (who guesses) or Peter (who calculates), but not by Roger (who cheats). \n\n### Step 1: Define the probabilities\n- **Alan's probability of answering correctly**: \\( P(A) = \\frac{1}{5} \\)\n- **Roger's probability of answering correctly**: \\( P(R) = \\frac{2}{3} \\)\n- **Peter's probability of answering correctly**: \\( P(P) = \\frac{5}{6} \\)\n\n### Step 2: Compute the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter\nThe probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter is given by the union of their individual probabilities:\n\\[\nP(A \\cup P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A \\cap P)\n\\]\nSince Alan and Peter's answers are independent:\n\\[\nP(A \\cap P) = P(A) \\cdot P(P) = \\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{1}{6}\n\\]\nSubstitute into the formula:\n\\[\nP(A \\cup P) = \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{5}{6} - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{6}{30} + \\frac{25}{30} - \\frac{5}{30} = \\frac{26}{30} = \\frac{13}{15}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Compute the probability that Roger does not answer correctly\nThe probability that Roger does not answer correctly is:\n\\[\nP(\\neg R) = 1 - P(R) = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Compute the combined probability\nThe probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger, is:\n\\[\nP((A \\cup P) \\cap \\neg R) = P(A \\cup P) \\cdot P(\\neg R)\n\\]\nSubstitute the values:\n\\[\nP((A \\cup P) \\cap \\neg R) = \\frac{13}{15} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{13}{45}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is:\n\n**Answer: E**",
