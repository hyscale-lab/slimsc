      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this algebra problem here. Let me read it again. It says, \"If 6x minus y equals 24 and y equals 3x, what is the value of x?\" Hmm, I think I can solve this by substitution. Oh right, substitution is when you replace a variable with its equivalent expression. \n\nSo, the two equations given are 6x - y = 24 and y = 3x. Since y is expressed in terms of x in the second equation, I can substitute 3x in place of y in the first equation. That should let me solve for x.\n\nLet me write that out. Substituting y with 3x in the first equation: 6x - (3x) = 24. Wait, so that becomes 6x minus 3x equals 24. Let me do the math. 6x minus 3x is 3x, so 3x equals 24. \n\nTo find x, I need to divide both sides by 3. So, 3x divided by 3 is x, and 24 divided by 3 is 8. So, x equals 8. \n\nLooking at the options, option A is 8. So the answer should be A. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst, substitute y with 3x in 6x - y =24. That gives 6x -3x=24. Yes, that's 3x=24. Dividing both sides by 3 gives x=8. Yep, that makes sense. So I'm confident the answer is A.\n",

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nWait, I remember that when you have two equations with two variables, you can use substitution or elimination. Since they've given me y in terms of x already, substitution should be straightforward. That makes sense because substitution is when you replace a variable with an expression involving the other variable.\n\nSo the first equation is 6x - y = 24. And the second equation is y = 3x. I can substitute the expression for y from the second equation into the first one. That way, I'll have an equation with only x, which I can solve.\n\nLet me write that out. Substitute y with 3x in the first equation. So it becomes 6x - (3x) = 24. Oh wait, because y is 3x, right?\n\nWait, so 6x minus 3x is 3x. So the equation simplifies to 3x = 24. Now I can solve for x by dividing both sides by 3.\n\nSo, 3x divided by 3 is x, and 24 divided by 3 is 8. So x equals 8? Hmm, let me double-check.\n\nIf x is 8, then y should be 3 times x, which is 24. Let me plug these back into the first equation to verify. 6 times 8 is 48, and 48 minus y (which is 24) equals 24. 48 minus 24 is indeed 24. That checks out.\n\nWait, but the options are A)8, B)9, C)10, D)11, E)12. So 8 is option A. So the correct answer should be A.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my substitution. So starting again: 6x - y =24, and y=3x. Substitute y, so 6x -3x=24. 3x=24, so x=8. Yep, that's right.\n\nAlternatively, I could have solved the equations using elimination, but substitution seems easier here because y is already expressed in terms of x. So substitution was the way to go.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations. The logic seems solid. So the answer must be 8, which is option A.\n",
