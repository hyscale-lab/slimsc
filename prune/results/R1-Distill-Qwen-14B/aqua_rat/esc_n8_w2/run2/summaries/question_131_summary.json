      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a man walking at different speeds for different durations, and I need to find his average speed. Hmm, let's think through this.\n\nWait, average speed is usually total distance divided by total time, right? Yeah, I remember that formula. So I need to calculate the total distance he walked and then divide it by the total time he spent.\n\nSo the problem says he walked at 5 km/h for 6 hours and then at 4 km/h for 12 hours. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, for the first part: speed is 5 km/h, time is 6 hours. Distance equals speed multiplied by time, so that's 5 * 6. Let me calculate that: 5*6 is 30. So he walked 30 km in the first part.\n\nNext, the second part: speed is 4 km/h, time is 12 hours. Again, distance is speed * time. So 4 *12 is 48. So he walked 48 km in the second part.\n\nAdding both distances together, 30 km + 48 km is 78 km. So total distance is 78 km.\n\nNow, total time is the sum of both time intervals. 6 hours plus 12 hours is 18 hours.\n\nSo average speed is total distance divided by total time. That would be 78 km / 18 hours. Let me do that division.\n\nWait, 78 divided by 18. Hmm, 18 times 4 is 72, which leaves a remainder of 6. So 4 with 6 left over. 6 divided by 18 is 1/3. So 4 and 1/3 km/h. Wait, that would be option A.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations. Because 5*6 is definitely 30, and 4*12 is 48. 30+48 is 78. Time is 6+12=18. 78/18 equals... let me think again. 18 times 4 is 72, 78-72 is 6, so 6/18 is 1/3. So yes, 4 1/3 km/h. So the answer should be option A.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option D is 8 km/h. That's much higher. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. Oh wait, no, the speeds are 5 and 4, times are 6 and 12. So calculations seem right.\n\nWait, another approach: average speed is (distance1 + distance2) / (time1 + time2). So 30+48=78, 6+12=18. 78/18 = 4.333... which is 4 and 1/3. So that's option A.\n\nSo the correct answer is A.\n",
