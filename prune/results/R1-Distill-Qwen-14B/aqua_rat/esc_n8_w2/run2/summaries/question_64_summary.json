      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about Sachin's batting average in the IPL season. Hmm, I remember that batting average is calculated by dividing the total runs scored by the number of innings batted. \n\nSo, initially, his average is 51. Then, he scores 78 runs in the finals, and his average goes up to 54. We need to find the total number of matches he's played in the season.\n\nWait, wait. I think the key here is to set up the equations correctly. Let's see. Let me denote the number of matches he played before the finals as 'n'. Then, the total runs he had before the finals would be 51 multiplied by n, right? Because average is total runs divided by number of innings, so total runs = average * number of innings.\n\nAfter the finals, he plays one more match, so the number of matches becomes n + 1. His total runs become 51n + 78. And his new average is 54. So, the new average is (51n + 78) divided by (n + 1) equals 54.\n\nLet me write that equation out: (51n + 78)/(n + 1) = 54.\n\nNow, I can solve for n. Multiply both sides by (n + 1) to get rid of the denominator. That gives 51n +78 = 54(n + 1).\n\nExpanding the right side: 54n + 54.\n\nSo, 51n +78 = 54n +54.\n\nLet me bring like terms together. Subtract 51n from both sides: 78 = 3n +54.\n\nWait, wait, wait. 54n minus 51n is 3n. So, 78 -54 is 24. So, 3n =24.\n\nDivide both sides by 3: n =8.\n\nOh, wait, so n is 8. That means he played 8 matches before the finals, and then one more, so total of 9 matches. So the total number of matches is 9.\n\nLet me check that. Before finals, 8 matches, average 51: 8*51=408 runs. After scoring 78, total runs 486. Number of matches is 9. 486/9=54. Yep, that checks out.\n\nSo the answer should be 9, which is option C.\n",

Hmm, I remember batting average is calculated as total runs divided by the number of matches, right?

Then, in the finals, he scores 78 runs, and his average becomes 54. I need to find out how many matches he played in total.\n\nWait, so before the finals, he had a certain number of matches, let's call that 'n'. His average was 51, so his total runs before the finals would be 51 multiplied by n. Then, in the finals, he plays one more match, so the total number of matches becomes n+1. His new average is 54, so the total runs now are 54 multiplied by (n+1).\n\nBut wait, the total runs after the finals include the 78 runs he scored in the final match. So, the total runs after the finals would be the previous total runs plus 78.\n\nPutting this together, I can set up an equation. Let me write that out.\n\nSo, initial total runs = 51 * n.\n\nAfter the final match, total runs = 51n + 78.\n\nAnd this equals 54 * (n + 1), because the new average is 54 and the number of matches is n+1.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n51n + 78 = 54(n + 1)\n\nLet me expand the right side: 54n + 54.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n51n + 78 = 54n + 54\n\nHmm, I need to solve for n.

So after the final, the total matches are n+1, which is 8+1=9. So the total number of matches played is 9.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations.
