      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about population growth in Boomtown. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nThe question says that the planners expect a 10% increase each year for the next two years. So, if the population is P right now, next year it'll be P plus 10% of P, which is 1.1 * P. And the year after that, it'll be 1.1 times that, so 1.1 * 1.1 * P, which is 1.21 * P. So two years from now, the population would be 1.21P.\n\nWait, the problem also states that this future population (two years from now) would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Hmm, let me parse that. One year ago from now would be P divided by 1.1, right? Because if the current population is P, then a year ago it was P / 1.1. Because the population was 10% less a year ago.\n\nSo, two years from now, the population is 1.21P, and that equals double the population of one year ago. So 1.21P = 2 * (P / 1.1).\n\nLet me write that equation down: 1.21P = 2*(P / 1.1). Let me solve for P, but I think P will cancel out. Let's see.\n\nDivide both sides by P: 1.21 = 2/(1.1). Let me compute 2 divided by 1.1. Well, 1.1 is 11/10, so 2 / (11/10) is 2 * (10/11) = 20/11 \u2248 1.818. So 1.21 \u2248 1.818? Wait, that doesn't make sense because 1.21 is less than 1.818. So that can't be right. Did I set up the equation correctly?\n\nWait, maybe I got the timeline wrong. Let me think again. Let's define the current time as year 0. The population is P0. Next year (year 1) it's P0 * 1.1. The year after that (year 2) it's P0 * 1.1^2 = 1.21 P0.\n\nNow, the population two years from now (year 2) is double the population of one year ago. One year ago from now would be year -1. So the population in year -1 was P_{-1}, and according to the problem, P2 = 2 * P_{-1}.\n\nBut wait, how do I relate P_{-1} to P0? Because the growth is projected forward, but what about the past? Oh, I'm supposed to find the population increase over the last year, which would be from year -1 to year 0.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. The question says, which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? So the last year would be the year before this year. So if now is P0, the last year's population was P_{-1}, and the increase is (P0 - P_{-1}) / P_{-1} * 100%.\n\nBut according to the problem setup, the expected future growth is 10% per year for the next two years. So the past growth rate (from year -1 to year 0) is what we're trying to find.\n\nSo let me restate the given condition: P2 = 2 * P_{-1}.\n\nBut P2 is 1.21 * P0. So 1.21 P0 = 2 P_{-1}.\n\nWe can express P0 in terms of P_{-1}. Let's see. If the growth from year -1 to year 0 is x%, then P0 = P_{-1} * (1 + x/100).\n\nSo P0 = P_{-1} * (1 + x/100).\n\nSubstituting into the earlier equation: 1.21 * P0 = 2 P_{-1}.\n\nReplace P0 with P_{-1}*(1 + x/100):\n\n1.21 * P_{-1} * (1 + x/100) = 2 P_{-1}.\n\nWe can cancel P_{-1} from both sides (assuming it's not zero, which makes sense for a population):\n\n1.21 * (1 + x/100) = 2.\n\nDivide both sides by 1.21:\n\n(1 + x/100) = 2 / 1.21.\n\nLet me compute 2 / 1.21. Let's see, 1.21 is 121/100, so 2 / (121/100) = 200/121 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSo, 1 + x/100 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSubtract 1: x/100 \u2248 0.65289.\n\nMultiply both sides by 100: x \u2248 65.289%.\n\nSo the population increased by approximately 65.29% over the last year. Looking at the options, D is 65%, which is the closest.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the setup. I assumed that the last year refers to the year before the current year. So if the current population is P0, the last year's population is P_{-1}. And the two years from now is P2, which is 1.21 P0. So the condition is P2 = 2 P_{-1}.\n\nWait, but P0 is (1 + x) * P_{-1}, where x is the growth rate from the last year. So substituting, P2 = 1.21 * (1 + x) * P_{-1}.\n\nAnd P2 = 2 P_{-1}, so 1.21*(1 +x) = 2. So yes, (1+x) = 2/1.21 \u22481.65289, x\u22480.65289, so 65.289%. So the closest option is D)65%.\n",

So the statement is:\n\nP * 1.21 = 2 * P_one_year_ago.\n\nWait, but P_one_year_ago is the population one year before now. Let me think again. Let me set up the time points.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let t be the current time.\n- So, one year ago: t-1, population P.\n- Next year: t+1, population P * 1.10.\n- The year after that: t+2, population P * 1.10^2 = 1.21 P.\n\nThe problem says that the population at t+2 is exactly double the population at t-1. So:\n\nPopulation at t+2 = 2 * Population at t-1.\n\nSo:\n\n1.21 P = 2 * P_prev, where P_prev is the population at t-1.\n\nWait, but P_prev is the population one year ago, which is t-1. But wait, P is the population at t-1? Or am I mixing up the variables?\n\nWait, maybe I should let the population at time t be P.

So:\n\n1.21 P = 2 * P_prev.\n\nBut what's P_prev? It's the population at t-1, which is one year before now (time t). So P_prev is the population a year ago.\n\nWait, but P is the population now (time t). So the population one year ago was P_prev, and the population now is P. So, how are P_prev and P related?\n\nOh, wait, the population increased by some percentage from t-1 to t. Let's call that growth rate 'x', so P = P_prev * (1 + x).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nWe have two equations:\n\n1. 1.21 P = 2 * P_prev.\n\n2. P = P_prev * (1 + x).\n\nOur goal is to find x, which is the growth rate from t-1 to t, expressed as a percentage.\n\nSo substituting equation 2 into equation 1:\n\n1.21 * [P_prev * (1 + x)] = 2 * P_prev.\n\nWe can cancel P_prev from both sides (assuming it's not zero, which it isn't).\n\nSo:\n\n1.21 (1 + x) = 2.\n\nDivide both sides by 1.21:\n\n1 + x = 2 / 1.21.\n\nCalculating 2 / 1.21. Let me compute that.\n\n1.21 is approximately 121/100. So 2 divided by 121/100 is 2 * 100/121 = 200/121 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSo 1 + x \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSubtract 1: x \u2248 0.65289.\n\nSo x is approximately 65.289%. Looking at the options, the closest is option D)65%.\n\nWait, but the options are A)20%, B)40%, C)50%, D)65%, E)75%.\n\nSo the answer should be D)65%.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my steps. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the variables.\n\nWait, the problem says that the population increases by 10% each year for the next two years. So from now (current time t), in t+1 it's 1.1P, and t+2 it's 1.21P. And at t+2, it's double the population of one year ago, which is t-1. So:\n\nPopulation at t+2 = 2 * Population at t-1.\n\nWhich is 1.21 P = 2 * P_prev.\n\nAnd since P = P_prev * (1 + x), where x is the growth rate from t-1 to t.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n1.21 * P_prev * (1 + x) = 2 * P_prev.\n\nDivide both sides by P_prev:\n\n1.21 (1 + x) = 2.\n\nSo 1 + x = 2 / 1.21 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nx \u2248 0.65289, which is 65.289%.\n\nYes, that's correct.

P = P_prev * (1 + x).\n\nOur goal is to find x, which is the growth rate from t-1 to t, expressed as a percentage.\n\nSo substituting equation 2 into equation 1:\n\n1.21 * [P_prev * (1 + x)] = 2 * P_prev.\n\nWe can cancel P_prev from both sides (assuming it's not zero, which it isn't).\n\nSo:\n\n1.21 (1 + x) = 2.\n\nDivide both sides by 1.21:\n\n1 + x = 2 / 1.21.\n\nCalculating 2 / 1.21. Let me compute that.\n\n1.21 is approximately 121/100. So 2 divided by 121/100 is 2 * 100/121 = 200/121 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSo 1 + x \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSubtract 1: x \u2248 0.65289.\n\nSo x is approximately 65.289%. Looking at the options, the closest is option D)65%.\n\nWait, but the options are A)20%, B)40%, C)50%, D)65%, E)75%.\n\nSo the answer should be D)65%.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my steps. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the variables.\n\nWait, the problem says that the population increases by 10% each year for the next two years. So from now (current time t), in t+1 it's 1.1P, and t+2 it's 1.21P. And at t+2, it's double the population of one year ago, which is t-1. So:\n\nPopulation at t+2 = 2 * Population at t-1.\n\nWhich is 1.21 P = 2 * P_prev.\n\nAnd since P = P_prev * (1 + x), where x is the growth rate from t-1 to t.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n1.21 * P_prev * (1 + x) = 2 * P_prev.\n\nDivide both sides by P_prev:\n\n1.21 (1 + x) = 2.\n\nSo 1 + x = 2 / 1.21 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nx \u2248 0.65289, which is 65.289%.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the closest option is D)65%.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the percentage population increase in Boomtown over the last year, given that the population is expected to grow by 10% annually for the next two years, and the population two years from now will be double the population one year ago.\n\nLet\u2019s define the variables:\n\n- Let \\( P \\) be the population one year ago.\n- Let \\( x \\) be the percentage increase in population from one year ago to the present.\n\nThe population growth for the next two years can be modeled as:\n- After the first year: \\( P \\times (1 + 0.10) = 1.10P \\).\n- After the second year: \\( 1.10P \\times 1.10 = 1.21P \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the population two years from now (\\( 1.21P \\)) will be double the population one year ago (\\( P \\)). This gives the equation:\n\\[\n1.21P = 2P_{\\text{prev}}\n\\]\nwhere \\( P_{\\text{prev}} \\) is the population one year ago. Since \\( P = P_{\\text{prev}} \\times (1 + x) \\), substituting into the equation yields:\n\\[\n1.21 \\times (1 + x) = 2\n\\]\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\\[\n1 + x = \\frac{2}{1.21} \\approx 1.65289\n\\]\n\\[\nx \\approx 0.65289\n\\]\nThus, \\( x \\approx 65.289\\% \\). Among the given options, the closest value is **65%**.\n\nAnswer: D",
