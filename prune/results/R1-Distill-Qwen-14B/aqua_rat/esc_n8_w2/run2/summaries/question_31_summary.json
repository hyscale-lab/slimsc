      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about the retail price and wholesale cost of an appliance. Hmm, let me try to break it down. \n\nAlright, the question says the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost. So, if I let the wholesale cost be some amount, say W, then the retail price would be W plus 60% of W. Wait, 60% more than W\u2014so that's W multiplied by 1.6, right? Because 60% is 0.6, so 1 + 0.6 = 1.6. So, Retail Price (RP) = 1.6 * W.\n\nThen, the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price. Oh, okay, so the selling price is 20% less than RP. So, how do I calculate that? If the original price is RP, then 20% less would be RP minus 20% of RP. Alternatively, it's RP multiplied by (1 - 0.2) which is 0.8. So, Selling Price (SP) = 0.8 * RP.\n\nBut I want to express SP in terms of W, the wholesale cost. Since RP is 1.6W, then SP = 0.8 * 1.6W. Let me compute that. 0.8 multiplied by 1.6\u2014what's that? Let's see, 1.6 times 0.8. Hmm, 1.6 * 0.8 equals... 1.28. So SP = 1.28 * W.\n\nWait, so the selling price is 1.28 times the wholesale cost. That means it's 28% more than the wholesale cost because 1.28 is 128% of W. So, 128% minus 100% gives 28%. \n\nLet me double-check. Suppose the wholesale cost is $100. Then the original retail price would be $160 (because 100 + 60% of 100 is 160). Then, selling it for 20% less than $160 would be $160 minus 20% of 160. 20% of 160 is 32, so 160 - 32 = 128. So the selling price is $128. That's 128% of the wholesale cost, which is 28% more than the wholesale price. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nSo looking at the options, 28% is option B. So the answer should be B.\n",

Let me read it again.\n\nThe original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. Then, the appliance was sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price. The question is asking, what percent more was the selling price compared to the wholesale cost.\n\nHmm, I think I should break this down. Let me assign some variables to make it clearer. Let's say the wholesale cost is W. The original retail price was 60% more than W. So, how do I calculate that?\n\nOh right, 60% more means the retail price is W plus 60% of W. Which is W * (1 + 0.60) = 1.60 * W. So the original retail price is 1.6W.\n\nThen, the appliance was sold for 20% less than this original retail price. So, the selling price is 20% less than 1.6W. How do I compute that?\n\nWell, 20% less means I subtract 20% of 1.6W from 1.6W. So, 1.6W * (1 - 0.20) = 1.6W * 0.80. Let me calculate that: 1.6 * 0.8.\n\nWait, 1.6 times 0.8... Let's see, 1.6 * 0.8. 1.6 * 0.8 is the same as (1 + 0.6) * 0.8. Which would be 0.8 + 0.48 = 1.28. So 1.28 times W. So the selling price is 1.28W.\n\nNow, the question is, what percent more is this selling price than the wholesale cost? So, we're comparing the selling price to W, the wholesale cost.\n\nThe selling price is 1.28W, and the wholesale cost is W. So, the increase is 1.28W - W = 0.28W. So that's a 28% increase over W.\n\nLooking at the options, B is 28%. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, let me double-check.
