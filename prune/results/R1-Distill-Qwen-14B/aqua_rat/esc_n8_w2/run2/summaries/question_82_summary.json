      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so Julie has a rectangular yard, and I need to find the length of the other side. Hmm, let me think about this. I remember that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length and width. The formula is Area = length \u00d7 width. \n\nThe problem states that one side is 100 feet wide, and the total area is 3,000 square feet. Wait, so if one side is 100 feet, that's either the length or the width. But since the question is asking for the length of the other side, maybe I should figure out which one is which. Oh wait, the way it's phrased, \"one side is 100 feet wide\" \u2014 so that's the width. So the width is 100 feet, and the area is 3000 sq ft.\n\nSo to find the other side, which would be the length, I can rearrange the formula. The area is equal to length multiplied by width, so length equals area divided by width. \n\nLet me plug in the numbers. The area is 3,000 square feet, and the width is 100 feet. So length = 3,000 / 100. Let me do that division. 3000 divided by 100 is 30. So the length should be 30 feet. \n\nLooking at the options, option A is 30 feet. So the answer should be A. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up length and width. Oh yeah, because the problem says the other side is the length, so yeah, that calculation makes sense. So yeah, the correct answer is 30 feet.\n",
