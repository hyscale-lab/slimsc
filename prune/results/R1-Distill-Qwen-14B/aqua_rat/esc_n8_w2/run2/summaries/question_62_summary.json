      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this age-related problem to solve. Let me read it again and try to break it down.\n\nThe question says: Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. So I think it means that the difference between Q's age and R's age is the same as the difference between Q's age and T's age, but in the opposite direction. Because Q is younger than R, so R is older than Q, and Q is older than T, so T is younger than Q. So the differences would be R - Q and Q - T, and they are equal. Oh wait, I think that's the correct interpretation.\n\nThe second part says the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. So R + T = 50. And the question is asking for the definite difference between R and Q's age. So we need to find R - Q, I suppose.\n\nLet me assign variables to make this clearer. Let's say Q's age is Q, R's age is R, and T's age is T.\n\nFrom the first statement, Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So the difference between R and Q is the same as the difference between Q and T. So mathematically, R - Q = Q - T. Because Q is younger than R by the same amount that Q is older than T.\n\nSo equation one is R - Q = Q - T.\n\nEquation two is R + T = 50.\n\nHmm, so with these two equations, can I solve for R - Q?\n\nLet me rearrange equation one. R - Q = Q - T. Let's bring all terms to one side. So R - Q - Q + T = 0. So R + T - 2Q = 0. Oh, because R - Q is equal to Q - T, so combining them gives R + T = 2Q. Wait, that's interesting.\n\nBecause from equation two, R + T = 50. So substituting that into the equation R + T = 2Q gives 50 = 2Q. So Q would be 25. Oh, so Q is 25 years old.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for R - Q, the difference between R and Q's age. Let me see. Since R - Q = Q - T, and we know that R + T =50, but I'm not sure if that's enough to find R - Q.\n\nWait, let's see. From equation one, R - Q = Q - T. Let's call this difference D. So D = R - Q = Q - T.\n\nSo from R - Q = D, and Q - T = D, then R = Q + D, and T = Q - D.\n\nNow, substitute these into equation two: R + T =50.\n\nSo R + T = (Q + D) + (Q - D) = 2Q. So 2Q =50. So Q =25.\n\nSo Q is 25. But what about D? We need to find R - Q, which is D. But from equation one, we have R - Q = D, but how do we find D?\n\nWait, let me think. We have R = Q + D, and T = Q - D.\n\nSo R =25 + D, and T=25 - D.\n\nBut the sum R + T is (25 + D) + (25 - D) = 50. Which checks out because that's our equation two.\n\nSo D can be any value, but wait, does that mean D could be any number? Because with the given information, we only have two equations but three variables. Wait, no, because we have only two equations and three variables (R, T, Q). But wait, in this case, we found Q in terms of the sum, so Q is fixed at 25, but D is still variable.\n\nWait, no, because equation one gives us R - Q = Q - T, which leads to R + T = 2Q. And since R + T is 50, Q must be 25. So Q is fixed, but D could be anything? But that can't be, because the problem must have a unique answer. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think again. So we have Q=25. R =25 + D, T=25 - D.\n\nBut without more information, D could be any positive number, as long as T is not negative. So T=25 - D must be greater than zero, so D must be less than 25. But the problem doesn't give us any more constraints, like specific ages or something else. So the difference D could be any number between 0 and 25, but the question is asking for the definite difference between R and Q's age, which is D. But with the given information, D isn't fixed. So we can't determine it uniquely.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Because in the first statement, the way it's phrased, Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So the differences must be equal, but without knowing any specific ages, the only thing we can determine is that Q is exactly in the middle of R and T. So R is older than Q by the same amount that Q is older than T. So the ages form an arithmetic sequence: T, Q, R. So T < Q < R, and the difference between each is D.\n\nSo, in this case, since R and T sum to 50, and Q is the average of R and T. Because in an arithmetic sequence, the middle term is the average of the terms on either side. So Q = (R + T)/2. Which would be 50/2 =25. So that's why Q is 25. So R + T =50, and Q is 25.\n\nBut then, what is R - Q? Let's see: R = Q + D, so R - Q = D. But without knowing D, we can't find R - Q. Because D could be any value, as long as T is positive. For example, if D is 10, then R is 35, T is 15. If D is 20, R is 45, T is 5. So R - Q is 10 or 20, etc.\n\nSo in each case, R - Q is D, but we don't have enough info to find D. So the answer would be that the difference cannot be determined from the given information. So the answer is D) Cannot be determined.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options: the options are A)22, B)27, C)29, D)Cannot be determined, E)None of the above.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So the difference is the same in both cases. So the setup is correct. But without more data, we can't find D. So the difference R - Q is D, which could be any value, so we can't determine it. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this age-related problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the solution. Let's read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says: Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. The sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. We need to find the definite difference between R and Q's age. The options are given, and I have to choose the right one.\n\nHmm, I remember that when a problem says someone is as much younger as they are older, it often implies some kind of symmetric relationship. Let me try to translate this into equations.\n\nLet me denote the ages as Q, R, T. So, the first statement is: Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So, the difference between R and Q is the same as the difference between Q and T. \n\nWait, let me think. If Q is younger than R, that means R is older than Q by a certain amount. And Q is older than T by the same amount. So, the age difference between R and Q is the same as the age difference between Q and T.\n\nSo, mathematically, I can write that as:\n\nR - Q = Q - T.\n\nBecause R is older than Q by (R-Q), and Q is older than T by (Q-T). And these two differences are equal.\n\nSo, R - Q = Q - T.\n\nLet me rearrange this equation. Adding Q to both sides and adding T to both sides:\n\nR + T = 2Q.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Because R + T equals 2Q. Oh, and the problem also says that R + T is 50. So substituting that in:\n\n50 = 2Q.\n\nSo, solving for Q: Q = 25.\n\nWait, so Q is 25 years old.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the difference between R and Q's age. So, R - Q. From the equation R - Q = Q - T, which we can write as R = Q + (Q - T). But since R + T =50, and Q is 25, maybe I can find R in terms of T or vice versa.\n\nWait, but since R + T =50 and Q is 25, let's see what else we can find.\n\nWe have R - Q = Q - T. Let me express R and T in terms of Q. Let me see: From R - Q = Q - T, adding Q to both sides and adding T to both sides gives R + T = 2Q. We know R + T is 50, so 2Q=50 \u2192 Q=25.\n\nSo, R - Q = Q - T \u2192 R -25 =25 - T.\n\nHmm. Let me solve for R and T.\n\nFrom R + T =50, and R =25 + (25 - T). Wait, wait: Let's see. Let me think differently.\n\nSince R - Q = Q - T, then R = Q + (Q - T) \u2192 R = 2Q - T. But I'm not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, since R + T =50, and R =2Q - T, substituting into R + T=50:\n\n(2Q - T) + T =50 \u2192 2Q =50 \u2192 Q=25, which we already know.\n\nHmm, so maybe we can't find the exact values of R and T, but we can find R - Q.\n\nWait, from R - Q = Q - T, we can write this as R - Q = (Q - T). But since R + T =50, perhaps I can find R - Q in terms of R and T.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about R - Q. From the equation R - Q = Q - T, that's equal to (Q - T). So, R - Q = Q - T \u2192 R - Q = Q - T \u2192 R + T = 2Q, which we already have.\n\nWait, but I'm trying to find R - Q. From R - Q = Q - T, which is equal to the same as Q - T. But I don't have the values of T or R yet.\n\nWait, but R - Q is the same as Q - T. Let me call this common difference as D. So, D = R - Q = Q - T.\n\nSo, D = R -25 and D = 25 - T.\n\nSo, from R + T =50 and R =25 + D, T=25 - D.\n\nWait, substituting R and T in terms of D into R + T:\n\n(25 + D) + (25 - D) =50 \u2192 50 =50. Oh, that's an identity. So, D can be any value, as long as R =25 + D and T=25 - D. But that can't be right, because D has to be a positive number, since R is older than Q and Q is older than T.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify the exact ages of R and T, only that their sum is 50. So, without more information, can we find a definite value for D?\n\nWait, let's think about it. We have R =25 + D and T=25 - D. So, R and T are symmetrically placed around Q=25. But the problem is, we don't know D. So, D could be any positive number as long as T is positive. Because T can't be negative.\n\nSo, T must be greater than zero. So, 25 - D >0 \u2192 D <25.\n\nSo, D can be anywhere between just above zero and just below 25. So, the difference between R and Q is D, which can vary. So, without knowing more, we can't determine a specific value for D. Therefore, the difference between R and Q's age can't be determined with the given information.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The question is asking for the definite difference between R and Q's age. If D can vary, then the answer would be that it cannot be determined, right?\n\nBut looking back, I thought maybe R - Q is 25, but no, that's the age of Q. Wait, no. R is 25 + D, so R - Q is D. But without knowing D, we can't find it.\n\nSo, the answer would be option D, Cannot be determined.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Let me re-express the initial equation.\n\nWe have R + T =50 and R - Q = Q - T \u2192 R - Q = Q - T \u2192 R + T =2Q \u2192 which gives Q=25.\n\nSo, Q is 25. So, the difference between R and Q is R -25. But R can be anything as long as T is 50 - R. But the difference is R -25, which can vary. For example, if R is 30, T is 20. Then, R - Q is 5. If R is 40, T is 10, R - Q is15. So, the difference varies.\n\nTherefore, without more information, the difference can't be determined. So, the answer is option D.\n\nWait, but the options include E) None of the above. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA)22\nB)27\nC)29\nD)Cannot be determined\nE)None of the above\n\nWait, so if D is the correct choice, then the answer is D. But perhaps I'm missing something. Let me see if I can find a way to determine the difference.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me go back.\n\nThe first statement: Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T.\n\nSo, the difference between R and Q is equal to the difference between Q and T. So, R = Q + D, and T = Q - D. So, R = Q + D, T = Q - D.\n\nSo, R + T = (Q + D) + (Q - D) ) = 2Q. And the sum is 50 \u2192 2Q=50 \u2192 Q=25.\n\nSo, R =25 + D, T=25 - D.\n\nBut the problem is, D can be any value as long as T is positive. So, T=25 - D>0 \u2192 D<25.\n\nSo, R can be any age greater than 25, but less than 50, because T must be positive.\n\nTherefore, R - Q = D, which can be any positive number less than 25.\n\nThus, the difference between R and Q's age is D, which is not fixed. So, the difference cannot be determined from the given information.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D) Cannot be determined.\n",

But since R + T =50, and Q is 25, maybe I can find R in terms of T or vice versa.\n\nWait, but since R + T =50 and Q is 25, let's see what else we can find.\n\nWe have R - Q = Q - T. Let me express R and T in terms of Q. Let me see: From R - Q = Q - T, adding Q to both sides and adding T to both sides gives R + T = 2Q. We know R + T is 50, so 2Q=50 \u2192 Q=25.\n\nSo, R - Q = Q - T \u2192 R -25 =25 - T.\n\nHmm. Let me solve for R and T.\n\nFrom R + T =50, and R =25 + (25 - T). Wait, wait: Let's see. Let me think differently.\n\nSince R - Q = Q - T, then R = Q + (Q - T) \u2192 R = 2Q - T. But I'm not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, since R + T =50, and R =2Q - T, substituting into R + T=50:\n\n(2Q - T) + T =50 \u2192 2Q =50 \u2192 Q=25, which we already know.\n\nHmm, so maybe we can't find the exact values of R and T, but we can find R - Q.\n\nWait, from R - Q = Q - T, we can write this as R - Q = (Q - T). But since R + T =50, perhaps I can find R - Q in terms of R and T.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about R - Q. From the equation R - Q = Q - T, that's equal to (Q - T). So, R - Q = Q - T \u2192 R - Q = Q - T \u2192 R + T = 2Q, which we already have.\n\nWait, but I'm trying to find R - Q. From R - Q = Q - T, which is equal to the same as Q - T. But I don't have the values of T or R yet.\n\nWait, but R - Q is the same as Q - T. Let me call this common difference as D. So, D = R - Q = Q - T.\n\nSo, D = R -25 and D = 25 - T.\n\nSo, from R + T =50 and R =25 + D, T=25 - D.\n\nWait, substituting R and T in terms of D into R + T:\n\n(25 + D) + (25 - D) =50 \u2192 50 =50. Oh, that's an identity. So, D can be any value, as long as R =25 + D and T=25 - D. But that can't be right, because D has to be a positive number, since R is older than Q and Q is older than T.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify the exact ages of R and T, only that their sum is 50. So, without more information, can we find a definite value for D?\n\nWait, let's think about it. We have R =25 + D and T=25 - D. So, R and T are symmetrically placed around Q=25. But the problem is, we don't know D. So, D could be any positive number as long as T is positive. Because T can't be negative.\n\nSo, T must be greater than zero. So, 25 - D >0 \u2192 D <25.\n\nSo, D can be anywhere between just above zero and just below 25. So, the difference between R and Q is D, which can vary. So, without knowing more, we can't determine a specific value for D. Therefore, the difference between R and Q's age can't be determined with the given information.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The question is asking for the definite difference between R and Q's age. If D can vary, then the answer would be that it cannot be determined, right?\n\nBut looking back, I thought maybe R - Q is 25, but no, that's the age of Q. Wait, no. R is 25 + D, so R - Q is D. But without knowing D, we can't find it.\n\nSo, the answer would be option D, Cannot be determined.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Let me re-express the initial equation.\n\nWe have R + T =50 and R - Q = Q - T \u2192 R - Q = Q - T \u2192 R + T =2Q \u2192 which gives Q=25.\n\nSo, Q is 25. So, the difference between R and Q is R -25. But R can be anything as long as T is 50 - R. But the difference is R -25, which can vary. For example, if R is 30, T is 20. Then, R - Q is 5. If R is 40, T is 10, R - Q is15. So, the difference varies.\n\nTherefore, without more information, the difference can't be determined. So, the answer is option D.\n\nWait, but the options include E) None of the above. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA)22\nB)27\nC)29\nD)Cannot be determined\nE)None of the above\n\nWait, so if D is the correct choice, then the answer is D. But perhaps I'm missing something. Let me see if I can find a way to determine the difference.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me go back.\n\nThe first statement: Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T.\n\nSo, the difference between R and Q is equal to the difference between Q and T. So, R = Q + D, and T = Q - D. So, R = Q + D, T = Q - D.\n\nSo, R + T = (Q + D) + (Q - D) ) = 2Q. And the sum is 50 \u2192 2Q=50 \u2192 Q=25.\n\nSo, R =25 + D, T=25 - D.\n\nBut the problem is, D can be any value as long as T is positive. So, T=25 - D>0 \u2192 D<25.\n\nSo, R can be any age greater than 25, but less than 50, because T must be positive.\n\nTherefore, R - Q = D, which can be any positive number less than 25.\n\nThus, the difference between R and Q's age is D, which is not fixed. So, the difference cannot be determined from the given information.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D) Cannot be determined.\n\n\nThe problem states that Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T, and the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. We are tasked with finding the definite difference between R and Q's age.\n\nLet the ages of Q, R, and T be denoted as \\( Q \\), \\( R \\), and \\( T \\), respectively. The statement \"Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T\" implies that the difference between R and Q is the same as the difference between Q and T. This can be written mathematically as:\n\n\\[\nR - Q = Q - T\n\\]\n\nRearranging this equation gives:\n\n\\[\nR + T = 2Q\n\\]\n\nThe problem also states that \\( R + T = 50 \\). Substituting this into the equation above:\n\n\\[\n50 = 2Q \\implies Q = 25\n\\]\n\nThus, Q is 25 years old. To find the difference between R and Q's age (\\( R - Q \\)), we note that from \\( R - Q = Q - T \\), the difference \\( R - Q \\) is equal to \\( Q - T \\). However, without additional information about the exact values of \\( R \\) and \\( T \\), the difference \\( R - Q \\) cannot be uniquely determined. The ages of \\( R \\) and \\( T \\) are symmetrically placed around \\( Q = 25 \\), but the difference \\( R - Q \\) can vary as long as \\( R + T = 50 \\) and \\( T > 0 \\).\n\nFor example:\n- If \\( R = 30 \\), then \\( T = 20 \\), and \\( R - Q = 5 \\).\n- If \\( R = 40 \\), then \\( T = 10 \\), and \\( R - Q = 15 \\).\n\nSince \\( R - Q \\) can take multiple values depending on the specific ages of \\( R \\) and \\( T \\), the difference between R and Q's age cannot be determined definitively.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: D**",
