      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question here about an astronaut's weight on Earth and Venus, and I need to figure out what percentage the Venus weight is compared to Earth. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the weight of an object depends on the gravity of the planet it's on. So, the astronaut weighs different amounts because the gravitational pull on Venus is less than on Earth.\n\nWait, the question says the astronaut weighs 211 pounds on Earth and 182 on Venus. So I need to find what percentage 182 is of 211. Oh right, percentage calculation. I think the formula is (part / whole) * 100%. So here, the part is Venus weight, and the whole is Earth weight.\n\nLet me write that down. So part is 182, whole is 211. So 182 divided by 211, then multiply by 100. Let me do the division first. 182 \u00f7 211. Hmm, I'm not great at mental math, but maybe I can approximate.\n\nWait, 211 times 0.8 is 168.8, and 211 times 0.86 is, let's see, 211 * 0.8 is 168.8, 0.06*211 is 12.66, so 168.8 +12.66 is 181.46. Oh wait, that's close to 182. So 0.86 times 211 is about 181.46, which is just a bit less than 182. So the actual percentage would be a little over 86%, maybe like 86.3% or something.\n\nLooking at the options, D is 86% and E is 90%. So the closest is D. But wait, let me double-check my calculation to be sure. Maybe I should calculate it more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 182 / 211. Let me see, 211 goes into 182 how many times? Wait, 211 is bigger than 182, so it's less than 1. So 0.86 times 211 is 181.46, which is a little less than 182. The actual value would be a bit higher than 0.86.\n\nWait, 211 multiplied by 0.86 is 181.46. So 182 is 0.54 more than that. So 0.54 / 211 is about 0.00255. So adding that to 0.86 gives approximately 0.86255, so about 86.255%. So that's roughly 86.26%. So the percentage is approximately 86%, which would make D the correct answer.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Did I get the formula right? Oh yes, because the question is asking what percent of the Earth weight is the Venus weight. So yes, part is Venus weight, whole is Earth. So the calculation is correct.\n\nSo the answer should be D, 86%.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine what percent the astronaut\u2019s weight on Venus is compared to their weight on Earth, we use the formula for percentage:  \n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Part}}{\\text{Whole}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]  \nHere, the \"Part\" is the astronaut\u2019s weight on Venus (182 pounds), and the \"Whole\" is their weight on Earth (211 pounds).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question here about an astronaut's weight on Earth and Venus. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my planetary science, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe astronaut weighs 211 pounds on Earth and 182 pounds on Venus. The question is asking what percent of Earth weight is the Venus weight. So I need to calculate what percentage 182 is of 211.\n\nWait, right, percentage problems. The formula is (part / whole) * 100%. So in this case, the part is Venus weight, and the whole is Earth weight. So 182 divided by 211, then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nLet me calculate that. Let's see, 182 \u00f7 211. Hmm, I'll do the division step by step. Well, 211 goes into 182 zero times, so I'll add a decimal point and a zero, making it 1820. How many times does 211 go into 1820? Let me see, 211 * 8 is 1688. 211*9 is 1899, which is too big because 1820 is less than 1899. So 8 times. 8 * 211 is 1688. Subtract that from 1820: 1820-1688=132. Bring down another zero, making it 1320.\n\nNow, how many times does 211 go into 1320? Let's see, 211 *6 is 1266. That's less than 1320. 211*6=1266. Subtract that from 1320: 1320-1266=54. Bring down another zero, making it 540.\n\n211 goes into 540 twice, because 211*2=422. Subtract that from 540: 540-422=118. Bring down another zero, making it 1180.\n\n211 goes into 1180 about five times because 211*5=1055. Subtract: 1180-1055=125. Bring down a zero: 1250.\n\n211 goes into 1250 about 5 times again. 211*5=1055. Subtract: 1250-1055=195. Hmm, this is getting a bit tedious, but let me see. So far, the division is 0.8625... Wait, maybe I should use a calculator approach, but since I'm doing it manually, let's see.\n\nWait, maybe I should approximate. So 211 multiplied by 0.86 is approximately 182? Let me check that. 211 * 0.8 = 168.8. 211 * 0.06 = 12.66. So adding those, 168.8 +12.66 = 181.46. Oh, that's very close to 182. So 0.86 would give about 181.46, which is almost 182. So the percentage is approximately 86%.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 86%. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I should do the exact calculation. Let me try 182 divided by 211.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as 182/211. Let me see, 211 is the Earth's weight. So the ratio is 182/211.\n\nLet me compute 182 \u00f7 211. Let me set it up as a division problem.\n\n211 | 182.0000...\n\n211 doesn't go into 182, so 0., then 211 into 1820.\n\n211 *8=1688. Subtract: 1820-1688=132. Bring down a 0, making 1320.\n\n211 *6=1266. Subtract: 1320-1266=54. Bring down a 0: 540.\n\n211 *2=422. 540-422=118. Bring down 0: 1180.\n\n211*5=1055. 1180-1055=125. Bring down 0: 1250.\n\n211*5=1055. 1250-1055=195. Bring down 0: 1950.\n\n211*9=1899. 1950-1899=51. So, at this point, the quotient is 0.8625... So 0.8625 multiplied by 100 is 86.25%. So approximately 86%, which matches option D.\n\nSo the astronaut's weight on Venus is about 86% of their Earth weight. So the answer is D.\n",
