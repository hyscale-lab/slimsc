      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about finding the perimeter of a rectangle. Hmm, I remember that perimeter is the total distance around the shape. But wait, how exactly do you calculate that again? Oh right, for a rectangle, the formula is the sum of all sides. Let me think. The rectangle has two lengths and two widths, right?\n\nSo the length is given as 8 centimeters, and the width is 3 centimeters. Oh wait, I think the formula is perimeter equals 2 times length plus 2 times width. Or is it length plus width multiplied by 2? Either way, it should give the same result.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. So 2 times the length would be 2 * 8, which is 16. Then 2 times the width is 2 * 3, which is 6. Adding those together: 16 + 6 equals 22. So the perimeter should be 22 centimeters.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 22 cm. So that must be the correct answer. Wait, did I do that right? Another way to think about it: the perimeter is calculated by adding all four sides. So two sides are 8 cm each, and the other two are 3 cm each. So 8 + 3 + 8 + 3. Let's add 8 and 8 first, that's 16, and 3 and 3 is 6. 16 +6 is 22 again. Yep, same result. So I'm confident that B is correct.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the perimeter of a rectangle. Hmm, what's a perimeter again? Oh right, it's the total distance around the edge of a shape. For a rectangle, which has two pairs of equal sides, the formula should be straightforward.\n\nWait, I remember the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2*(length + width). Yeah, that's right. Because there are two lengths and two widths. So I don't have to add each side individually; just double the sum of one length and one width.\n\nThe problem gives the length as 8 centimeters and the width as 3 centimeters. So let me plug those numbers into the formula. \n\nFirst, add the length and width: 8 cm + 3 cm equals 11 cm. Then multiply that sum by 2. So 2 times 11 cm is 22 cm. \n\nWait, let me double-check. Sometimes I mix up the formulas. Another way to think about it is adding all four sides. The rectangle has two sides of 8 cm and two sides of 3 cm. So 8 + 8 is 16, and 3 +3 is 6.
