      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about chocolates in a store. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question says that all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored. So that's two categories: vanilla and cocoa. No other options. Got it.\n\nThe problem states that 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored. Wait, so that means the rest must be vanilla. Since 100% minus 10% is 90%, right? So 90% are vanilla. Makes sense.\n\nThen it says, 90% of the rest are squashed. Wait, wait. Wait a second. The \"rest\" here refers to the vanilla chocolates, right? Because the initial split was into vanilla and cocoa. So the rest after taking out cocoa would be vanilla. So the 90% squashed applies to the vanilla ones.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The problem says 90% of the rest are squashed. So the first part: 10% are cocoa, 90% are vanilla. Then, of the vanilla, 90% are squashed. So the question is asking for the percentage that are both vanilla and not squashed.\n\nSo, let me try to structure this. Let's say the total number of chocolates is 100 for simplicity. It makes percentages easy.\n\nTotal chocolates: 100.\n\nCocoa flavored: 10% of 100 = 10 chocolates. So vanilla is 90 chocolates.\n\nNow, 90% of the rest (which is vanilla) are squashed. So, the rest is 90. 90% of 90 is 81. So 81 vanilla chocolates are squashed.\n\nWait, but the question is about vanilla and not squashed. So the remaining vanilla chocolates are not squashed. So that's 90 total vanilla minus 81 squashed vanilla. So 9 not squashed vanilla.\n\nSo the percentage is 9 out of 100, which is 9%. Looking at the options, option D is 9%, so that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The problem says 90% of the rest are squashed. Oh, wait, does \"the rest\" refer to the entire batch minus the cocoa, which is 90? Or does \"the rest\" refer to something else?\n\nAlternatively, could \"the rest\" refer to the 90% vanilla? Because that's what I thought. So 90% of 90 (vanilla) are squashed. So yes, 81 squashed vanilla, 9 not. So 9% is the answer. So the correct option is D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves chocolates that are either vanilla or cocoa flavored. Since 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, the remaining 90% are vanilla. Of these vanilla chocolates, 90% are squashed. To find the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla and not squashed, we calculate as follows:\n\n1.
