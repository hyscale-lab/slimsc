      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where a product's price is reduced by 30%, and I need to figure out by what percentage it should be increased to bring it back to 100% of its original price. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nWait, so the product's price is first decreased by 30%. Let's say the original price is $100 for simplicity. If it's reduced by 30%, that means it's now 70% of the original price. Because 100% minus 30% is 70%. So, the new price is $70.\n\nNow, the question is asking what percentage increase is needed to get back to the original $100 from the reduced price of $70. Oh right, because if you have $70 and you want to reach $100, how much do you have to add?\n\nI remember that percentage increase is calculated by the amount of increase divided by the original amount (before the increase) multiplied by 100%. In this case, the increase needed is $30 (from $70 to $100). So, the formula would be (30 / 70) * 100%.\n\nLet me calculate that. 30 divided by 70 equals approximately 0.42857. Multiply that by 100% gives about 42.857%. Looking at the options, option B is 42.86%, which is really close. So that must be the correct answer.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me double-check. Starting at $70, increasing by 42.86% should get us back to $100. Let's compute 42.86% of 70. 0.4286 * 70 = approximately 30. So, adding that to 70 gives 100. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nSo the steps are: original price \u2192 reduced by 30% \u2192 new price is 70% of original. Then, the increase needed is (100 - 70)/70 * 100% = 42.86%. So the answer should be option B.\n",

Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding the problem. Suppose the original price of the product is P. When it's reduced by 30%, the new price becomes P minus 30% of P. So mathematically, that would be P * (1 - 0.30) which simplifies to P * 0.70. So the new price after the discount is 70% of the original price.\n\nNow, the question is asking by what percentage this new price should be increased to get back to the original price, which is 100% of P. So I need to find the percentage increase from 70% P to 100% P.\n\nWait, how do you calculate the percentage increase? Oh right, percentage increase is calculated by (Final Value - Initial Value) / Initial Value * 100%. In this case, the initial value is the discounted price (70% of P), and the final value is the original price (100% of P).\n\nSo plugging in the numbers, the increase needed is (100% - 70%) / 70% * 100%. Let me compute that. The numerator is 30%, and the denominator is 70%. So 30 divided by 70 equals approximately 0.42857. Multiplying by 100% gives 42.857%, which is about 42.86%.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 42.86%, so that must be the correct answer. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAnother way to think about it: Let's say the original price is $100 for simplicity. A 30% discount brings it down to $70. To get back to $100 from $70, the increase needed is $30. So percentage increase is ($30 increase) / ($70 new base) *100% = 30/70 *100% \u2248 42.857%, which again is 42.86%. Yep, that's the same result. So the answer should be option B.\n",
