      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so Amy has 10 different types of books, and she wants to code each with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. The goal is to find the smallest number of letters she needs to create all these codes uniquely. Hmm, let me think about this.\n\nWait, the problem says each code is either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. And the order doesn't matter in the pair. So, for example, AB is the same as BA, right? So each pair is just a combination, not a permutation.\n\nSo, Amy needs 10 unique codes. Each code can be one letter or two letters. The question is, what's the minimal number of letters required so that the total number of possible codes (single letters plus all possible unique pairs) is at least 10.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's say she uses 'n' letters. The number of single-letter codes possible is n. The number of two-letter pairs is the combination of n letters taken 2 at a time, which is n*(n-1)/2. Because order doesn't matter, so we don't multiply by 2.\n\nSo the total number of possible codes is n + [n*(n-1)/2]. We need this sum to be at least 10.\n\nSo, the equation is n + (n choose 2) \u2265 10.\n\nLet me calculate for different n values.\n\nStart with n=4:\nn =4. Single letters:4. Pairs:4*3/2=6. Total=4+6=10. Oh, that's exactly 10. So with 4 letters, she can make 10 codes. That seems perfect.\n\nWait, but let's check n=3 just in case. n=3: singles=3, pairs=3*2/2=3. Total=6. That's only 6, which is less than 10. So n=3 is insufficient.\n\nn=4 gives exactly 10. So Amy can assign each of the 10 books a unique code with 4 letters.\n\nWait, but the options include 4 as option B. So the answer would be B)4.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Are all the codes unique when using 4 letters? Let me see. Each single letter is unique, and each pair is a unique combination.\n\nSo yes, 4 letters would allow 4 single codes and 6 pairs, totaling 10. Since she needs 10 codes, that's exactly enough. So the minimal number is 4.\n",

The goal is to find the smallest number of letters she needs to represent all 10 books uniquely. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you're dealing with codes like this, you're probably dealing with combinations. Since the order doesn't matter in the pairs, it's combinations, not permutations. So for a given number of letters, say N, how many unique codes can Amy create?\n\nWell, each code can be a single letter or a pair. So the total number of possible codes would be the number of single letters plus the number of possible pairs. \n\nLet me denote the number of letters as L. Then, the number of single-letter codes is simply L. The number of two-letter pairs would be the combination of L letters taken 2 at a time, which is calculated as L choose 2, or L*(L-1)/2.\n\nSo the total number of codes possible is L + (L*(L-1)/2). We need this total to be at least 10 because she has 10 books to code.\n\nLet me try plugging in the options to see which is the smallest L that satisfies this condition.\n\nOption A is 3. Let's compute: 3 + (3*2/2) = 3 + 3 = 6. That's only 6 codes. But she needs 10, so A is too small.\n\nOption B is 4. Calculating: 4 + (4*3/2) = 4 + 6 = 10. Oh, that gives exactly 10. Wait, that's exactly the number she needs. So with 4 letters, she can have 4 single-letter codes and 6 two-letter codes, totaling 10. So that should work, right?\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If she uses 4 letters, the two-letter combinations are C(4,2) = 6. So 4 single letters plus 6 pairs = 10 codes. Each book gets a unique code. So that's exactly sufficient.\n\nWait, but what if she uses 3 letters? Then she could make 3 single letters and 3 pairs (since C(3,2)=3), totaling 6. Not enough. So 4 letters would give the exact number needed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if using 4 letters is the minimal. Could she have a mix where some books are single letters and others are pairs, but perhaps not using all possible pairs? No, because the problem says each type is uniquely represented by either a single or pair. So she must have all single letters and all possible pairs.\n\nWait, but the question says each type is uniquely represented by either a single letter or a pair. So she can't have two books with the same single letter or same pair. So she must use each single letter once and each pair once.\n\nWait, but with 4 letters, she can create 4 single-letter codes and 6 pair codes. But she only has 10 books, which is exactly 4+6=10. So that's perfect. So 4 letters are sufficient.\n\nLooking at the options, B is 4. So the answer should be B.\n",
