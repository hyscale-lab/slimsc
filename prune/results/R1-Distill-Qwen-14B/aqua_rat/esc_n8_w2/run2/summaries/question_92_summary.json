      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a telephone bill that's partly fixed and partly varies with the number of calls. Hmm, I think I remember that this is a linear cost model, right? Like, the total cost is a fixed amount plus a variable cost per unit. So, the bill can be expressed as something like Total = Fixed + (Variable rate * Number of calls). \n\nThe problem gives me two scenarios. First, when 540 calls are made, the bill is Rs.1800. Second, when 620 calls are made, the bill is Rs.2040. And then I need to find out what the bill would be for 500 calls. \n\nLet me break this down. I think I can set up two equations based on the given data. Let's denote the fixed cost as F and the variable cost per call as V. \n\nSo, for the first case: \nF + 540V = 1800. \n\nAnd for the second case:\nF + 620V = 2040. \n\nNow I have two equations with two variables. I should be able to solve for F and V using these. Maybe I can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate F. Let's try that.\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n(F + 620V) - (F + 540V) = 2040 - 1800. \nSimplify that: F cancels out, so 620V -540V = 240. \nSo, 80V = 240. \n\nDivide both sides by 80: V = 240 / 80 = 3. \n\nSo each call costs Rs.3. Now that I have V, I can plug it back into either equation to find F. Let's use the first equation.\n\nF + 540*3 = 1800. \n540 *3 is 1620. So F + 1620 = 1800. \nSubtract 1620 from both sides: F = 1800 - 1620 = 180. \n\nSo the fixed cost is Rs.180 and the variable cost is Rs.3 per call. \n\nNow, the question is asking for the bill when 500 calls are made. So using the same formula:\n\nTotal = F + 500V. \nPlugging in the numbers: 180 + 500*3. \n\n500 *3 is 1500. So 180 + 1500 = 1680. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is Rs.1680. So the answer should be B.\n",

I need to find out what the bill would be for 500 calls.\n\nWait, so I think I can set up two equations here. Let me denote the fixed cost as F and the variable cost per call as V. Then the total bill (B) would be F + V * number of calls.\n\nSo for the first case: 540 calls, bill is 1800. So equation 1 is F + 540V = 1800.\n\nThe second case: 620 calls, bill is 2040. Equation 2: F + 620V = 2040.\n\nNow, I can subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate F.

So the variable cost per call is 3 rupees.\n\nNow that I have V, I can plug it back into either equation to find F. Let's use equation 1: F +540*3 = 1800.\n\nCalculating 540*3: 540*3 is 1620. So F +1620 = 1800. Subtract 1620 from both sides: F = 1800 -1620 = 180. So the fixed cost is 180 rupees.\n\nNow, for the third scenario, the number of calls is 500. So the bill would be F + 500V.\n\nPlugging in the values: 180 + 500 * 3. 500*3 is 1500. So 180 +1500 = 1680.\n\nWait, looking at the options, option B is 1680. So the correct answer should be B.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nV was calculated as 3, correct.
