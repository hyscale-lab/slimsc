      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a canal's cross-section shaped like a trapezium. Hmm, trapezium. Wait, in the US, a trapezium is what they call a trapezoid here, right? But I think in the UK, trapezium refers to a quadrilateral with no sides parallel, which is what a trapezoid is in the US. Oh well, maybe it doesn't matter much for this problem. The key thing is that it's a trapezoid, which has two parallel sides.\n\nThe problem states that the canal is 10 meters wide at the top and 6 meters at the bottom. The area of the cross-section is 640 square meters. I need to find the depth of the canal.\n\nWait, wait, depth in a canal's cross-section... Oh, right! The depth here is the height of the trapezium. Because the cross-section is a trapezoid, the height would be the perpendicular distance between the two parallel sides (top and bottom). So the area of a trapezium is given by the formula: (sum of the two parallel sides) multiplied by the height, divided by two. Oh right, the formula is (a + b)/2 * h, where a and b are the lengths of the two parallel sides, and h is the height (depth in this case).\n\nSo given that, the area A is 640 m\u00b2. The top width (a) is 10 m, bottom width (b) is 6 m. Wait, wait, wait a second. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If the top is wider than the bottom, the depth would be the height, but in a trapezium, the sides can slope inwards or outwards. But in a canal, the cross-section usually has the top wider than the bottom. So the two parallel sides are the top and bottom, with top being longer.\n\nWait, but wait, in the formula, the order of a and b doesn't matter because addition is commutative. So regardless of which is larger, the formula remains the same.\n\nSo the area A is 640 = (10 + 6)/2 * h. Let's compute that.\n\n10 + 6 is 16. Divided by 2 is 8. So 8 * h = 640. So h = 640 / 8. Let's see, 8 times 80 is 640. So h would be 80 meters. But wait, that seems really deep for a canal. That's like way too much. Maybe I did something wrong.\n\nWait, wait, the options given are A)26, B)28, C)21, D)80, E)23. So 80 is one of the options, option D.\n\nBut a canal 80 meters deep? That's like a really big canal. Hmm, maybe the problem is correct, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Could it be that the depth is the height, which is h, and perhaps the given widths are the other sides. Wait, no, the problem clearly states the canal is 10m wide at the top and 6m at the bottom. So the parallel sides are 10 and 6. So the formula should hold.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me recheck.\n\nArea = (a + b)/2 * h. So 640 = (10 +6)/2 * h \u2192 640 = 16/2 * h \u2192 640 = 8h \u2192 h=640/8 \u2192 h=80.\n\nSo according to this, the depth is 80 meters. But that seems enormous. Maybe I'm missing something. Oh wait, perhaps the cross-section is a trapezium, but the given dimensions are not the top and bottom but perhaps the two non-parallel sides? No, the problem says the canal is 10m wide at the top and 6m at the bottom, which implies that the two parallel sides are top and bottom.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the area is 640 square meters per unit length of the canal. Wait, no, the area given is the cross-sectional area, which is 2D. So it's just the area of the trapezium.\n\nHmm, another thought: perhaps the problem is that I used the formula correctly but the answer is 80, which is option D.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, D is 80. So perhaps that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, 80 meters is really deep. Maybe the problem is stated differently. Let me read the problem again.\n\n\"The cross-section of a canal is shaped like a trapezium. If the canal is 10 m wide at the top and 6 m wide at the bottom and the area of cross-section is 640 square meters, the depth of cannel is?\"\n\nWait, perhaps the 'depth' refers to the height of the trapezium, which is the vertical distance between the two parallel sides. So that's correct.\n\nSo maybe the answer is 80 meters. But that seems too much. But perhaps in some contexts, canals can be that deep.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. Wait, the area of a trapezoid is (a + b)/2 * h. So if a is 10, b is 6, then (16)/2 is 8, so 8h = 640 \u2192 h=80.\n\nHmm. So the only option matching is D)80.\n\nWait, but in the options, E is 23, C is 21, B is 28, A is 26. So 80 is an option, but I'm wondering why the other options are so much smaller.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Maybe the cross-sectional area is 640 square meters, but the canal is 10 meters wide at the top and 6 meters at the bottom. Wait, perhaps the cross-section is a trapezium, but perhaps the sides are not straight. No, the question says it's a trapezium, so the sides are straight.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it differently. What's the formula again? Area = (sum of the two bases) multiplied by height, divided by two.\n\nSo, 640 = (10 +6)*h / 2 \u2192 640 = 16h/2 \u2192 640=8h \u2192 h=80.\n\nSo yes, that's correct. So the answer should be D)80. So why are the other options so low? Maybe the problem was swapped, like 10 meters at the bottom and 6 at the top? Let's see.\n\nIf the top is 6 and bottom 10, then same calculation: (6+10)/2 *h = 8h. So 640=8h \u2192 h=80. Same result.\n\nHmm. So unless I've messed up something else, the answer should be D.\n\nBut wait, another thought: perhaps the area is 640 square meters per kilometer or something? No, the question says the area of cross-section is 640 square meters, so that's correct.\n\nSo the only conclusion is that the depth is 80 meters, which is option D.\n",
