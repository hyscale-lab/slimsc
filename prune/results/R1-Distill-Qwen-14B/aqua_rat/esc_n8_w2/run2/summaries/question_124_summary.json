      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again: \"30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to its one third. What is the value of 50% of that number?\" Hmm, okay. \n\nWait, let me parse that sentence. So, there's a number, let's call it 'x'. When we subtract 30 from it, the result is one third of the original number. Oh right, so the equation would be x minus 30 equals one third of x. That makes sense. \n\nSo, the equation is x - 30 = (1/3)x. I think that's right. Now, I need to solve for x. Let me rearrange this. Subtract (1/3)x from both sides. That would give x - (1/3)x -30 = 0. Wait, no, maybe a better way is to get all the x terms on one side. \n\nLet me subtract (1/3)x from both sides. So, x - (1/3)x equals 30. Because when I subtract (1/3)x from x, I get (2/3)x. Because 1 minus 1/3 is 2/3. So, (2/3)x = 30. \n\nNow, to solve for x, I can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 2/3, which is 3/2. So, x equals 30 multiplied by 3/2. Let's calculate that. 30 times 3 is 90, divided by 2 is 45. So, x is 45. \n\nWait, but the question isn't asking for the number itself. It's asking for 50% of that number. So, 50% is the same as half. So, half of 45 is 22.5. Let me check: 45 divided by 2 is 22.5. \n\nLooking at the options, option A is 22.5. So, that should be the correct answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. \n\nAnother way to check: If x is 45, subtracting 30 gives 15. And 45 divided by 3 is 15. Yep, that works. So, the number is 45, half of that is 22.5, so option A is correct. \n\nI think that's all. So the answer should be A.\n",

So, according to the problem, when I subtract 30 from x, the result is one third of the original number.

Alternatively, I can rearrange the equation like this: x - (1/3)x = 30.\n\nHmm, because if I have x minus (1/3)x, that would be (2/3)x.
