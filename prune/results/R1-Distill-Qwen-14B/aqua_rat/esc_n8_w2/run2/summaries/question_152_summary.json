      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: In an exam, a candidate secured 504 marks out of the maximum mark M. If the maximum mark M is converted into 800 marks, he would have secured 420 marks. I need to find the value of M. The options are given as A)278, B)2890, C)270, D)2702, E)960.\n\nHmm, okay. So the candidate's score is 504 when the maximum is M. Then, when the maximum is changed to 800, his score becomes 420. I think this is about scaling the marks, like adjusting the maximum and then recalculating the corresponding score.\n\nLet me think. So, when the maximum is M, he scored 504. If the maximum is now 800, his score is 420. So, I guess this is a proportion problem. Because if the maximum changes, the same performance (like the same actual knowledge) would correspond to a different mark based on the new maximum.\n\nWait, but wait. Another way to look at it is that the ratio of his score to the maximum remains the same in both cases. Because whether the maximum is M or 800, his performance relative to the maximum is the same. So, 504/M = 420/800. Because both represent the same percentage or ratio of the maximum.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So I can set up the equation: 504/M = 420/800.\n\nNow, I need to solve for M. Let me write that down.\n\n504 / M = 420 / 800.\n\nCross-multiplying gives: 504 * 800 = 420 * M.\n\nSo, M = (504 * 800) / 420.\n\nLet me compute that. First, I can simplify 504 divided by 420. Let's see, 504 \u00f7 420. Well, 420 times 1 is 420, subtracting from 504 gives 84. So 504 = 420 * 1 + 84. So 504/420 = 1 + 84/420 = 1 + 1/5 = 6/5? Wait, 84 divided by 420 is 0.2, which is 1/5. So 504/420 is 1.2 or 6/5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can simplify the equation before calculating. Let's see: 504 and 420 are both divisible by, say, 84. Let me check.\n\nWait, 420 divided by 84 is 5. Because 84*5=420. 504 divided by 84 is 6, because 84*6=504. So 504/420 = 6/5. So yeah, same as before.\n\nSo, M = (504 * 800) / 420. Let's substitute 504 as (6/5)*420.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to simplify 504/420 first.\n\n504 divided by 420. Let's see, 420 goes into 504 once, with 84 left over. So, 504 = 420 + 84 = 420*(1 + 84/420) = 420*(1 + 1/5) = 420*(6/5). So 504/420 = 6/5.\n\nSo, M = (6/5 * 800) / (since 504/420 is 6/5, so 504 * 800 /420 is (6/5)*800).\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me redo that part. 504 is (6/5)*420, so 504 *800 = (6/5)*420 *800. Then, when you divide by 420, the 420 cancels out. So M = (6/5)*800.\n\nWait, that's a better way to think about it. Because 504 is (6/5)*420, so:\n\nM = (504 *800) /420 = ( (6/5)*420 *800 ) /420.\n\nThe 420 in the numerator and denominator cancel out, leaving (6/5)*800.\n\nSo, M = (6/5)*800 = (6 * 800)/5.\n\nCalculating that: 800 divided by 5 is 160. So 6*160 is 960. So M is 960.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 960. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Because sometimes when converting between scales, you have to make sure about the ratio.\n\nSo, the candidate's score is 504 when the max is M. When the max is 800, his score is 420. So the ratio of his score to the max should be the same. So 504/M = 420/800.\n\nCross-multiplying gives 504 *800 =420*M.\n\nSo M = (504 *800)/420.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n504 *800 = 504 *8 *100 = 4032 *100 =403200.\n\nThen, 403200 /420.\n\nHmm, 420 times 900 is 378000. 420 times 960 is 403200 because 420*900=378000, 420*60=25200, 378000+25200=403200. So 420*960=403200, so 403200/420=960.\n\nSo M=960, which is option E.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, E is 960, but I also see option C is 270, which is way off. So yeah, E is correct.\n",
