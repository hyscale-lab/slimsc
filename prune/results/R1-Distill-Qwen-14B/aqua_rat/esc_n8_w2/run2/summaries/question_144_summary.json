      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe problem says that events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6, and the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. I need to find the probability that event B occurs. The options are A) 0.5, B) 0.6, C) 0.7, D) 0.8, E) 0.9.\n\nHmm, okay. So I remember that for independent events, the probability of both occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. Also, when dealing with the probability of at least one of two events happening, I think the formula involves adding their probabilities and then subtracting the probability that both occur. Because otherwise, you'd be double-counting the overlap.\n\nWait, right, the formula is P(A \u2228 B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2227 B). Since A and B are independent, P(A \u2227 B) is P(A) * P(B). So substituting that in, the formula becomes P(A) + P(B) - P(A) * P(B).\n\nGiven that, I can plug in the values I have. I know P(A) is 0.6, and P(A \u2228 B) is 0.96. So let's write that equation out.\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B)).\n\nWait, that's the equation. Now I need to solve for P(B). Let me simplify this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute 0.6 * P(B) and see how that plays into the equation. So,\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6 P(B).\n\nHmm, I can factor out P(B) from the second and third terms. Let me see:\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) * (1 - 0.6).\n\nBecause 1 - 0.6 is 0.4, so this becomes:\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4 P(B).\n\nNow, I'll subtract 0.6 from both sides to get the term with P(B) by itself.\n\n0.96 - 0.6 = 0.4 P(B).\n\nCalculating 0.96 minus 0.6, that's 0.36. So,\n\n0.36 = 0.4 P(B).\n\nTo solve for P(B), I'll divide both sides by 0.4.\n\nP(B) = 0.36 / 0.4.\n\nLet me compute that. 0.36 divided by 0.4. Hmm, 0.4 goes into 0.36 how many times? Wait, 0.4 * 0.9 is 0.36. So P(B) is 0.9.\n\nWait, that would make the probability of B 0.9. But let me double-check my math because 0.9 seems a bit high. Let me go through each step again.\n\nOriginal equation: P(A\u2228B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B)\n0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6 P(B)\n\nSo, 0.96 = 0.6 + (1 - 0.6) P(B)\nWhich is 0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4 P(B)\n\nSubtract 0.6: 0.36 = 0.4 P(B)\nDivide both sides by 0.4: P(B) = 0.36 / 0.4 = 0.9.\n\nWait, that's correct. So the probability of B is 0.9. Looking at the options, E is 0.9. So the answer should be E.\n\nBut wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me try plugging P(B)=0.9 back into the original equation to see if it adds up.\n\nP(A) = 0.6, P(B)=0.9.\n\nP(A\u2228B) = 0.6 + 0.9 - (0.6 * 0.9)\nWhich is 1.5 - 0.54 = 0.96.\n\nYes, that matches the given value. So the answer is E) 0.9.\n",

So, the formula for the probability of both A and B happening is P(A) * P(B). \n\nWait, the problem mentions the probability of at least one of them occurring. Oh right, that's the probability of the union of A and B. The formula for that is P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B). Since A and B are independent, P(A \u2229 B) is P(A)*P(B).\n\nSo putting that together, the equation becomes P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)*P(B).\n\nWe know P(A) is 0.6, and P(A \u222a B) is 0.96.
