      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a shopkeeper who gave a discount and now needs to figure out the percentage increase to get back to the original price. Hmm, let me try to think this through.\n\nAlright, the problem says the shopkeeper gave a 20% discount on all items for one day. The next day, he wants to sell them at the original price again. So, he needs to increase the discounted price by a certain percentage. The question is asking by what percentage he must increase the price to get back to the original.\n\nWait, I remember that percentage changes can be a bit tricky when going up and down. Like, if you decrease by a certain percentage and then increase by another, you don't just reverse the percentage. It's not as simple as adding 20% again because the base changes.\n\nLet me break it down. Suppose the original price of an item is $100. That makes the math easy. So, on the first day, he gives a 20% discount. 20% of 100 is 20, so the discounted price is $80.\n\nNow, the next day, he wants to go back to $100 from $80. So, what's the percentage increase from 80 to 100? I think the formula for percentage increase is ((New Price - Old Price)/Old Price) * 100%.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: (100 - 80)/80 * 100% = (20/80)*100%. 20 divided by 80 is 0.25, and multiplying by 100 gives 25%. So, he needs to increase the discounted price by 25% to get back to the original price.\n\nWait, let me check if I did that right. If the original is 100, 20% off is 80. Then 25% of 80 is 20 (since 0.25 *80=20). Adding that to 80 gives 100. Yep, that makes sense. So the correct percentage is 25%.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 25%, so that's the answer. The other options don't fit. For example, 20% would bring it up to 96, which is not enough. 33% would be a third, which is about 26.66, making the new price 106.66, which is over. So definitely option C.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the percentage increase needed to return to the original price after a 20% discount, let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Original Price and Discount**:  \n   Assume the original price of an item is $100. A 20% discount reduces the price to:  \n   \\[\n   100 - 0.20 \\times 100 = 80 \\, \\text{( discounted price)}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Percentage Increase Needed**:  \n   To return to the original price of $100 from the discounted price of $80, the percentage increase required is calculated as:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{New Price} - \\text{Old Price}}{\\text{Old Price}}\\right) \\times 100\\%.\n   \\]  \n   Substituting the values:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left(\\frac{100 - 80}{80}\\right) \\times 100\\% = \\left(\\frac{20}{80}\\right) \\times 100\\% = 25\\%.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Verification**:  \n   A 25% increase on $80 is:  \n   \\[\n   0.25 \\times 80 = 20.\n   \\]  \n   Adding this to $80 gives:  \n   \\[\n   80 + 20 = 100,\n   \\]  \n   confirming that a 25% increase returns the price to its original value.\n\n4. **Analysis of Options**:  \n   - **A) 21%**: This would only increase the price to $96.60, which is insufficient.  \n   - **B) 20%**: This would increase the price to $96, which is also insufficient.  \n   - **C) 25%**: This correctly increases the price to $100.  \n   - **D) 33%**: This would increase the price to $106.67, which is too high.  \n   - **E) 18%**: This would increase the price to $94.40, which is insufficient.  \n\nThus, the correct answer is **25%**.\n\nAnswer: C",

Let me think about percentages and how they work when you increase or decrease something.

Oh right, the formula for percentage increase is: [(New Price - Old Price)/Old Price] * 100%.\n\nIn this case, the old price is the discounted price, which is $80, and the new price is the original $100.

So the correct percentage is 25%.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 25%, so that should be the answer. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the old and new prices.
