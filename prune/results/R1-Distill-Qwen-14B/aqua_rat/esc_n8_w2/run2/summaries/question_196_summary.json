      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about electric poles and trees casting shadows. Hmm, I remember something about similar triangles or maybe proportions from math class. Let me think. The question says an electric pole that's 14 meters high casts a shadow of 10 meters. Then there's a tree that casts a shadow of 15 meters, and I need to find its height. \n\nWait, right, because the sun's angle is the same for both, the triangles formed by the pole and the tree with their shadows should be similar. So similar triangles have proportional sides. That means the ratio of the pole's height to its shadow should be the same as the tree's height to its shadow. \n\nLet me write this down. So the ratio would be 14 meters (pole height) over 10 meters (shadow) equals tree height (let's call it h) over 15 meters (tree's shadow). So the equation is 14/10 = h/15. \n\nWait, but wait, wait. Oh, right, I can cross-multiply to solve for h. So 14 times 15 equals 10 times h. Let me compute that. 14 times 15... 10 times 14 is 140, and 5 times 14 is 70, so 140 +70 = 210. So 210 = 10h. Then h is 210 divided by 10, which is 21. \n\nSo the tree should be 21 meters high. Looking at the options, option A is 21. That's the first option. So the answer must be A.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about electric poles and trees casting shadows. Hmm, I remember something about similar triangles from math class. Let me think about how that applies here.\n\nThe problem says an electric pole is 14 meters high and casts a shadow of 10 meters. Then there's a tree that casts a shadow of 15 meters, and I need to find its height. Oh right, similar triangles because the sun's rays are coming at the same angle for both, so the triangles formed by the pole and tree with their shadows are similar.\n\nSo, similar triangles have proportional sides. That means the ratio of the pole's height to its shadow should be the same as the tree's height to its shadow. Let me write that down as a proportion.\n\nPole height / Pole shadow = Tree height / Tree shadow\n\nPlugging in the numbers I have:\n\n14 / 10 = Tree height / 15\n\nWait, I can solve for the tree height here. Let me rearrange the equation. Multiply both sides by 15 to get the tree height by itself.\n\nTree height = (14 / 10) * 15\n\nHmm, calculating that. 14 divided by 10 is 1.4. Then 1.4 multiplied by 15. Let's do that step by step. 15 times 1 is 15, and 0.4 times 15 is 6, so 15 +6 =21. So the tree height is 21 meters?\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 21. So that should be the answer. Wait, but let me double-check my math. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, 14 over 10 is the same as 140 over 100, which simplifies to 14/10 = 7/5. So 7/5 multiplied by 15. Let's see, 7 times 15 is 105, divided by 5 is 21. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the correct answer must be A)21.\n",
