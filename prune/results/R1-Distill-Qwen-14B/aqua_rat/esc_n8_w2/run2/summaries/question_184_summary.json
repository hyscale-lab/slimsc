      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully. The problem says, \"A number is as much greater than 36 as it is less than 86. Find the number.\" Hmm, I need to find a number that's equally distant from 36 and 86, but in opposite directions. Like, the difference between the number and 36 should be the same as the difference between 86 and the number.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me make sure I understand correctly. It says the number is as much greater than 36 as it is less than 86. So, the amount by which the number exceeds 36 is the same as the amount by which 86 exceeds the number. So, if the number is X, then X - 36 = 86 - X. Oh, that makes sense. Because the difference above 36 is the same as the difference below 86.\n\nSo, setting up the equation: X - 36 = 86 - X. Let me solve this. I'll bring all the X terms to one side and the constants to the other. So, X + X = 36 + 86. That gives 2X = 122. Then, X = 122 / 2. 122 divided by 2 is 61. So X is 61.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If X is 61, then 61 minus 36 is 25. And 86 minus 61 is also 25. Oh, right, that works. So the number is 61. Looking at the options, D is 61. So the answer should be D.\n\nBut wait, are there other options that might fit? Let me check each option just to be sure. Option A is 60. 60 -36 is 24, and 86-60 is 26. Not equal. Option B is 56. 56-36 is 20, 86-56 is 30. Not same. Option C is 51. 51-36 is 15, 86-51 is 35. No. Option D is 61, which we've checked and works. Option E is 41. 41-36 is 5, 86-41 is 45. Not equal. So yes, D is the correct answer.\n",

The question says: \"A number is as much greater than 36 as it is less than 86. Find the number.\" Hmm, that's a bit of a tricky wording. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I'll try to parse the sentence. The number is greater than 36 by a certain amount, and at the same time, it's less than 86 by the same amount. So, the difference between the number and 36 is the same as the difference between 86 and the number. That makes sense because the number is in the middle, right? Like, it's equidistant from 36 and 86.\n\nWait, so if I think about it on a number line, the number is somewhere between 36 and 86. The distance from 36 to the number is the same as from the number to 86. So, that means the number is exactly halfway between 36 and 86. Oh, right! Because when a number is equidistant from two other numbers, it's the average of those two. So, I can calculate the average of 36 and 86 to find the number.\n\nLet me do that calculation. The average of two numbers is (sum of the numbers)/2. So, (36 + 86)/2. Let's add them up: 36 plus 86. 36 plus 80 is 116, and then plus 6 is 122. So, 122 divided by 2 is 61. So the number should be 61.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because sometimes these word problems can be tricky. The way the problem is phrased: \"as much greater than 36 as is less than 86.\" So, if the number is X, then X - 36 = 86 - X. Because the amount it's greater than 36 is the same as the amount it's less than 86.\n\nSo, let's set up the equation: X - 36 = 86 - X. Let's solve for X. Adding X to both sides gives 2X -36 = 86. Then, adding 36 to both sides: 2X = 86 +36. 86 plus 36 is 122, so 2X = 122. Dividing both sides by 2, X=61. Yep, that's the same answer as before.\n\nLooking at the options, D is 61. So the correct answer should be D. Let me make sure none of the other options make sense. Let's see, the options are A)60, B)56, C)51, D)61, E)41. If I plug in 60, then 60-36=24 and 86-60=26. Not the same. 56: 56-36=20, 86-56=30. No. 51-36=15, 86-51=35. Not same. 61: 61-36=25, 86-61=25. Yes, same. So, D is correct.\n",
