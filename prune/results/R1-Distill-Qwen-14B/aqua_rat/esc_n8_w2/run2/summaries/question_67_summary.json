      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about vitamins in a health food, and I'm supposed to figure out how much of it someone needs to eat to get enough of both vitamins E and A. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says that one gram of this health food has 9% of the minimum daily requirement (MDR) for vitamin E and 8% for vitamin A. And we need to find out how many grams are needed daily so that both vitamin requirements are met. So, the person shouldn't be getting less than 100% of either vitamin's MDR from this food alone.\n\nHmm, so I think this is a problem where each vitamin's requirement leads to a different amount of grams needed. Because 9% comes from E and 8% from A, but each has its own MDR. So, the grams needed for E would be higher than for A, but since we need both, we have to take the higher of the two. Or wait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nWait, no. Let me model this properly. Let's say the MDR for vitamin E is E grams, and for vitamin A is A grams. But actually, maybe it's easier to think in terms of percentages. Because the food provides a certain percentage of each vitamin's MDR per gram.\n\nSo, per gram, you get 9% of E's MDR and 8% of A's MDR. Let's denote x as the grams of health food consumed daily. Then, the total vitamin E from x grams would be 9% * x, and vitamin A would be 8% * x.\n\nBut wait, we need each of these to be at least 100% of their respective MDRs. So, for vitamin E, 9% of x must be >= 100% of E's MDR. Similarly for vitamin A, 8% of x must be >= 100% of A's MDR.\n\nWait, no. I think I'm getting that wrong. Let me correct. Let me define variables properly. Let me say that the MDR for vitamin E is E and for A is A. But the problem states that 1 gram provides 9% of E's MDR and 8% of A's MDR.\n\nSo, per gram:\n- Vitamin E contribution: 0.09 * E (since 9% of E is 0.09 * E)\n- Vitamin A contribution: 0.08 * A\n\nBut wait, that might not be the right way. Alternatively, perhaps the 9% and 8% are in terms of the MDR. So, perhaps the MDR for E is some amount, say E, and the food gives 0.09E per gram. Similarly, the food gives 0.08A per gram for vitamin A.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of fractions. Let's think that the MDR for E is 1 unit (since percentages are relative). Similarly, the MDR for A is also 1 unit? Or maybe not, because the percentages are different.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me denote M_E as the MDR for vitamin E, and M_A as the MDR for vitamin A. Then, per gram, the food provides 0.09 * M_E of vitamin E and 0.08 * M_A of vitamin A.\n\nWe need to find x grams such that:\n\n0.09 * M_E * x >= M_E (for vitamin E)\nand\n0.08 * M_A * x >= M_A (for vitamin A)\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because each gram contributes 9% of M_E, so x grams would contribute 9% * x * M_E. We need this to be >= M_E, same for A.\n\nSo, let's write the inequalities:\n\n0.09 * x * M_E >= M_E\nand\n0.08 * x * M_A >= M_A\n\nWe can divide both sides by M_E and M_A respectively, since M_E and M_A are positive.\n\nSo for vitamin E: 0.09 x >= 1 \u2192 x >= 1 / 0.09 \u2192 x >= approx 11.11 grams.\nFor vitamin A: 0.08 x >= 1 \u2192 x >= 1 / 0.08 \u2192 x >= 12.5 grams.\n\nSo, since we need both conditions to be satisfied, x must be at least the larger of these two values. So 12.5 grams is the minimum needed to satisfy both.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 12.5 grams.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nVitamin E: 9% per gram. So to get 100%, we need 1 / 0.09 grams. 1 divided by 0.09 is approximately 11.11 grams. So 11.11 grams would give exactly 100% of E.\n\nVitamin A: 8% per gram. 100% would require 1 / 0.08 = 12.5 grams. So 12.5 grams would give exactly 100% of A.\n\nSo, if you eat 12.5 grams, you get 9% * 12.5 = 1.125 \u2192 which is 112.5% of E's MDR. And 8% *12.5 = 1 \u2192 exactly 100% of A's MDR.\n\nSo, that's sufficient. But what if you eat less than 12.5? For example, 11.11 grams. Then, for E, you get 100%, but for A, you get 8% * 11.11 = 0.8888 \u2192 88.88%, which is below the required 100%. So you'd be deficient in A.\n\nSo, to meet both, you need at least 12.5 grams. So the correct answer should be C) 12.5.\n",

The question is asking how many grams of this health food someone needs to eat daily to get at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamin E and vitamin A. \n\nAlright, let's read the problem again. One gram of the health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement for vitamin E and 8% for vitamin A. Oh wait, so each gram gives some percentage of each vitamin. But the person needs to meet at least 100% of both requirements, right?\n\nWait, wait. Let me think. So, if one gram gives 9% of vitamin E, then to get 100%, I would need to eat 100/9 grams of the health food. Similarly for vitamin A, which is 8% per gram, so 100/8 grams. But wait, that can't be right because then you'd have to eat different amounts for each vitamin, but you can't eat two different amounts. So you have to find a single amount that meets or exceeds both requirements.\n\nOh, right. So the idea is that the same amount of grams needs to provide at least 100% for both vitamins. So for vitamin E, the grams must be enough that 9% times grams is at least 100%. Same for vitamin A: 8% times grams is at least 100%. So I need to find the grams that satisfy both conditions.\n\nSo let's write that out. Let grams be 'g'. Then:\n\n9% of g >= 100% of vitamin E's requirement\nand\n8% of g >= 100% of vitamin A's requirement.\n\nWait, but wait, actually, the way the problem is phrased, each gram gives 9% of the minimum daily requirement for vitamin E. So for example, if the minimum requirement for E is x mg, then each gram provides 0.09x mg. Similarly, each gram provides 0.08y mg of vitamin A, where y is the minimum requirement for A.\n\nBut wait, no, actually, I think the problem is that the percentages are based on the same daily requirements. Let me think again. The problem says one gram contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. So perhaps the daily requirement for E is E, and for A is A. So each gram gives 0.09E and 0.08A.\n\nBut we need the total from the food to be at least E and A respectively.\n\nSo if we eat g grams, then the total E from the food is 0.09E * g, and the total A is 0.08A * g.\n\nWe need:\n\n0.09E * g >= E\nand\n0.08A * g >= A.\n\nWait, but this seems a bit off. Because if E is the daily requirement, then 0.09E per gram. So to get E, the total needed would be E = 0.09E * g + other sources, but in this case, other sources are zero. So 0.09E * g >= E. Similarly for A.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to set variables. Let\u2019s say the minimum daily requirement for vitamin E is E units, and for vitamin A is A units.\n\nEach gram of the food provides 0.09E and 0.08A.\n\nSo, when you eat g grams, you get 0.09E * g of vitamin E, and 0.08A * g of vitamin A.\n\nTo meet the minimum daily requirement, both of these must be >= E and >= A, respectively.\n\nSo, for vitamin E: 0.09E * g >= E. Hmm, but wait, that would mean 0.09g >= 1, because E cancels out on both sides. Similarly, for vitamin A: 0.08g >= 1.\n\nSo solving for g:\n\nFor E: g >= 1 / 0.09 = approximately 11.111 grams.\n\nFor A: g >= 1 / 0.08 = 12.5 grams.\n\nWait, because 0.09g >=1 \u2192 g >=1/0.09 \u224811.111\n\nAnd 0.08g >=1 \u2192 g >=1/0.08=12.5.\n\nSo to satisfy both, you need to choose the higher value, since the grams have to meet both requirements. So the minimum grams needed is 12.5 grams. Because 12.5 grams would provide 0.09*12.5 = 1.125, which is more than 1 (so E is satisfied), and 0.08*12.5=1, which meets A's requirement.\n\nWait, but wait: the problem states that each gram gives 9% of the requirement for E. So if the requirement is 100% (let's say 1 unit), then each gram provides 0.09 units. So to get at least 1 unit of E, you need 1 / 0.09 \u224811.11 grams. Similarly, for A, each gram gives 0.08 units, so 1 /0.08=12.5 grams.\n\nSo to satisfy both, you have to eat enough grams so that both E and A are met. Since 12.5 grams gives you enough E (because 12.5 *0.09=1.125 which is more than 1) and exactly enough A (12.5 *0.08=1).

To meet 100% of the requirement, the number of grams needed is:\n   \\[\n   g \\geq \\frac{1}{0.09} \\approx 11.11 \\, \\text{grams}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Vitamin A Requirement**: Each gram of the health food provides 8% of the minimum daily requirement for vitamin A. To meet 100% of the requirement, the number of grams needed is:\n   \\[\n   g \\geq \\frac{1}{0.08} = 12.5 \\, \\text{grams}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combined Requirement**: To satisfy both vitamin requirements simultaneously, the grams of health food must meet or exceed the higher of the two values. Therefore, the minimum number of grams required is:\n   \\[\n   g = 12.5 \\, \\text{grams}.\n   \\]\n\nAt 12.5 grams:\n- Vitamin E: \\( 12.5 \\times 0.09 = 1.125 \\), which exceeds 100% of the requirement.\n- Vitamin A: \\( 12.5 \\times 0.08 = 1 \\), which meets exactly 100% of the requirement.\n\nThus, the minimum number of grams needed is **12.5 grams**.\n\nAnswer: C",
