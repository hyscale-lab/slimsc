      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: A man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 1/2% of his income. His monthly income is? The options are A to E, with E being none of these.\n\nHmm, right. So, the man's total income is the amount he spends plus the amount he saves. I remember that percentages can sometimes trip me up, but let's think this through.\n\nWait, so he saves 12.5% of his income. Because 12 1/2% is the same as 12.5%. So if I let his income be, say, X rupees, then the amount he saves is 12.5% of X. The rest is what he spends.\n\nSo, the amount he saves is 12.5% of X, which is the same as 0.125 * X. And the amount he spends is X minus that saving. Or wait, no, because he's spending 3500, so the equation should be:\n\nSpending + Savings = Income.\n\nSo, 3500 (spending) + (12.5% of income) = income.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. He spends 3500, and saves 12.5% of his income. So the saved amount is 12.5% of his income, which is part of his total income. So the rest of his income (100% - 12.5%) is what he spends.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you save a percentage of your income, the amount you spend is your income minus the saved amount. So:\n\nSavings = 12.5% of income.\n\nSpendings = Income - Savings.\n\nWhich would be:\n\nSpendings = Income - (12.5% of Income)\n= Income * (1 - 0.125)\n= Income * 0.875.\n\nWait, but the problem says he spends 3500. So:\n\n3500 = 0.875 * Income.\n\nSo, to find the income, I can rearrange this equation.\n\nIncome = 3500 / 0.875.\n\nLet me calculate that. Hmm, 3500 divided by 0.875. Let me think. 0.875 is the same as 7/8. So dividing by 7/8 is the same as multiplying by 8/7.\n\nSo 3500 * (8/7) = ?\n\n3500 divided by 7 is 500. Because 7*500 is 3500. Then 500 multiplied by 8 is 4000.\n\nSo, the income is 4000. Let me check the options. Option C is 4000. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it another way. Let's see.\n\nIf his income is X, then he saves 12.5% of X. So, the amount saved is (12.5/100)*X = 0.125 X. The amount spent is 3500. So, 0.125 X is the saving, and the rest, 0.875 X, is what he spends. So, 0.875 X = 3500. So, X = 3500 / 0.875. Which again gives 4000. So, yeah, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as ratios. Since he saves 1/8 of his income (because 12.5% is 1/8), then the 7/8 is what he spends. So, 7/8 of his income is 3500.\n\nSo, 7 parts correspond to 3500. Each part is 3500 /7 = 500. So, 8 parts would be 8 * 500 = 4000. Yep, same result.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C, Rs. 4000.\n",

We need to find his monthly income. The options are given from A to E.\n\nHmm, right. So, the man's expenditure is Rs. 3500, and he saves a certain percentage of his income. Wait, saving is a part of his income, right? So, his total income is the sum of what he spends and what he saves.\n\nLet me think about this. Let's denote his monthly income as 'I'. He spends 3500, so the amount he saves must be his income minus 3500. And the saving is 12.5% of his income. So, the equation would be:\n\nSavings = I - 3500\nAnd Savings is also 12.5% of I, which is (12.5/100) * I.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\nI - 3500 = (12.5/100) * I\n\nLet me write that as an equation. So,\n\nI - 3500 = (0.125) * I\n\nNow, I can rearrange this equation to solve for I. Let's subtract 0.125I from both sides:\n\nI - 0.125I - 3500 = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n0.875I - 3500 = 0\n\nWait, because 1 - 0.125 is 0.875.

So, dividing by 7/8 is the same as multiplying by 8/7.\n\nSo, I = 3500 * (8/7)\n\nLet's compute 3500 divided by 7 first. 3500 /7 is 500. Because 7 * 500 is 3500. Then, 500 multiplied by 8 is 4000.\n\nSo, I = 4000.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is Rs. 4000. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If his income is 4000, he saves 12.5%, which is 500. Because 12.5% of 4000 is 500. So, his expenditure is 4000 -500 = 3500, which matches the given data. So yes, that's correct.\n",
