      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out the average speed for the athlete's two activities. Let's see what the problem says.\n\nAlright, the athlete runs M miles in 4 hours. Then, rides a bike N miles in the same number of hours. Hmm, same number of hours as the running part, which is 4 hours. So both activities take 4 hours each? Or does each activity take the same amount of time as the other? Wait, the wording says \"in the same number of hours.\" So maybe the bike ride also takes 4 hours. Wait, no, the first part is M miles in 4 hours, the second is N miles in the same number of hours\u2014so the bike ride also took 4 hours. So the total time for both activities is 4 + 4 = 8 hours.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me read that again. The problem says: \"rides a bike N miles in the same number of hours.\" Oh, so the same number of hours as the running part, which was 4 hours. So each activity took 4 hours. So the total time is 4 + 4 = 8 hours.\n\nBut wait, another thought: maybe I'm misinterpreting. Is the bike ride taking the same total time as the running, or the same per-mile time? No, the wording says the same number of hours. So each activity took 4 hours.\n\nSo, the athlete spends 4 hours running M miles, and another 4 hours biking N miles. So total distance is M + N, and total time is 8 hours.\n\nWait, but average speed is total distance divided by total time. So average speed would be (M + N) divided by 8. So that's (M + N)/8. Looking at the options, option A is M + N divided by 8. So option A would be (M + N)/8.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nThe first part: running M miles in 4 hours. So the speed while running is M/4 mph.\n\nThe second part: biking N miles in 4 hours. So biking speed is N/4 mph.\n\nBut wait, no, that's the speed for each activity. But average speed for the entire journey is total distance over total time.\n\nTotal distance: M + N.\n\nTotal time: 4 + 4 = 8 hours.\n\nSo average speed is (M + N)/8, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option C is (M + N)/4, which would be if the total time was 4 hours, but that's not the case here.\n\nSo the correct average speed is (M + N)/8, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options:\n\nA) M + N / 8 \u2192 that's (M + N) divided by 8. Yes.\n\nSo the answer should be option A.\n",
