      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: Of the 200 students in a school, at least 45% attended the prom night and at least 35% took part in the debating session. What is the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session?\n\nThe options are A)27, B)81, C)90, D)99, E)110.\n\nHmm, right. So, I think this is a problem about sets and maybe using some principles like inclusion-exclusion. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's break down the given information. There are 200 students total. At least 45% attended the prom, and at least 35% debated. I need to find the maximum number who did neither. So, to maximize the number who did neither, I should minimize the number who did either or both.\n\nWait, right. Because if fewer students went to prom or debated, then more could have done neither. But how?\n\nSo, let's calculate the minimum number of students that attended the prom and the minimum that debated. Because if those are as low as possible, their union would be as small as possible, leaving more for neither.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The problem says \"at least\" 45% and \"at least\" 35%. So, the actual numbers could be higher. But since I want the maximum number who did neither, I should take the minimum number of students in each event. Because if more students attended each event, that would leave fewer who did neither.\n\nSo, let's compute the minimum attendees for each.\n\n45% of 200 is 90 students. So, at least 90 went to prom.\n\n35% of 200 is 70 students. So, at least 70 debated.\n\nBut wait, how do these two groups overlap? Because some students might have gone to both events. To find the maximum number who did neither, I need the minimal overlap between the two groups. Because if the two groups have as many overlapping students as possible, the total number of students who did at least one of the two events would be smaller. Wait, no, wait. No, wait, no. Let me think again. Let's think about the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nThe formula is |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|.\n\nTo find the maximum number of students who did neither, which is the same as (total students) - |A \u222a B|, I need to minimize |A \u222a B|. So, to minimize |A \u222a B|, we need to maximize |A \u2229 B|.\n\nBecause if |A \u2229 B| is as large as possible, then |A \u222a B| is as small as possible.\n\nWait, so that's the key. Because |A \u222a B| is minimized when the overlap is as large as possible.\n\nSo, the maximum possible overlap is the minimum of |A| and |B|. Because you can't have more overlap than the smaller of the two sets.\n\nWait, so in this case, |A| is 90, |B| is 70. So the maximum possible |A \u2229 B| is 70. Because all 70 debaters could have also gone to the prom.\n\nSo, substituting into the formula, |A \u222a B| = 90 + 70 - 70 = 90.\n\nSo, the number of students who attended prom or debated is at least 90.\n\nWait, but wait, is that the minimum? Because if |A| is 90 and |B| is 70, and their intersection is 70, then the union is 90. But could the union be smaller than that? Let me think.\n\nWait, no. Because if all the 70 in B are also in A, then the union is just 90. But if some are not, then the union would be larger. So, the minimal possible union is when the overlap is maximum, which is 70, giving |A \u222a B|=90.\n\nSo, the minimal number of students who went to prom or debated is 90. Therefore, the number who did neither is 200 - 90 = 110.\n\nWait, but 110 is one of the options. Option E is 110.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense. Because 110 is a lot, but let me check my reasoning.\n\nWait, the problem says \"at least\" 45% went to prom. So, the actual number could be more than 90. Similarly for the debaters, it's at least 70. So, if the number of prom attendees is more than 90, and debaters more than 70, then the overlap could be higher. Wait, no, because the overlap can't be higher than the smaller set. Wait, no, the overlap can't be higher than the size of either set.\n\nWait, let's think again. If the prom attendees are 90, and debaters are 70, then the maximum possible overlap is 70. But if the prom attendees are more than 90, say 100, and debaters are 70, then the maximum overlap would still be 70, because you can't have more than 70 in the intersection if the debaters are only 70. So, |A| can be larger, but the maximum possible |A \u2229 B| is still 70. So, even if |A| is larger, the maximum possible overlap remains 70.\n\nSo, if |A| is 100 and |B| is 70, then the maximum overlap is 70. So, the union would be 100 +70 -70=100.\n\nWait, but wait, no. Because if A is 100 and B is 70, the maximum possible overlap is 70, so the union is 100. But if A is 90 and B is 70, the union is 90.\n\nSo, in our case, the minimal union is 90, which occurs when A is exactly 90 and B is exactly 70, and all B are in A.\n\nBut wait, the problem states \"at least\" 45% and \"at least\" 35%. So, the number of prom attendees could be more than 90, and the number of debaters could be more than 70. So, the maximum possible overlap is when all debaters are in the prom attendees. But if prom attendees are larger than 90, say 100, then the maximum overlap is 70 (since there are only 70 debaters). So, in any case, the minimal possible union is 90 (when A is 90, B is 70, and all B are in A).\n\nBut wait, if A is more than 90, like 100, then the minimal union would be 100 +70 -70 =100. But that's more than 90. So, the minimal union is when A and B are as small as possible and as much overlapping as possible.\n\nSo, in the minimal case, when A is 90, B is 70, and all B are in A, the union is 90. So, the minimal number of students who attended either event is 90.\n\nThus, the maximum number of students who did neither is 200 -90=110, which is option E.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option E is 110, which is the number I got. But I have to make sure that this is correct.\n\nWait, let me think again. If 90 went to prom, and 70 debated, and all 70 were among the 90, then the total unique students who did something is 90. So, 200-90=110 neither. So that's the maximum possible.\n\nBut wait, is that allowed? Because the problem says at least 45% attended prom. So, 45% is 90, but the number could be higher. So, if more than 90 attended prom, say 91, and 70 debated, but all 70 are in the 91, then the union would be 91. So, 200-91=109, which is less than 110. So, to get the maximum number who did neither, the number of prom attendees should be exactly 90, and all debaters are within that 90.\n\nAh, so that's why the maximum is 110. Because if the prom attendees are exactly 90, and all debaters are within that 90, then the union is 90. But if the prom attendees are more than 90, the union would be larger, reducing the number who did neither.\n\nSo, to maximize neither, we need the union to be as small as possible. Which happens when the prom attendees are exactly 90, and all debaters are within that 90.\n\nSo, yes, the maximum number who did neither is 110. So, the answer is E.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 110. But let me double-check my math.\n\nWait, 45% of 200 is 90, correct. 35% is 70. So, if 90 went to prom, 70 debated, and all 70 were in the 90, then 90 +70 -70 =90 in the union. So, 200-90=110. That seems correct.\n\nSo, the maximum number who did neither is 110, which is option E.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about 200 students in a school. The question is about figuring out the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor participated in the debating session. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nAlright, the problem says that at least 45% attended the prom, and at least 35% took part in the debating session. I'm trying to find the maximum number who didn't do either. So, I guess I need to use some principles from set theory or maybe the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nWait, right. The inclusion-exclusion principle is about the union of two sets. The formula is |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|. But since I'm looking for the number of students who didn't attend either, that's the complement of A \u222a B, so 200 minus |A \u222a B|.\n\nBut to maximize the number of students who neither attended the prom nor debated, I need to minimize |A \u222a B|. Because if |A \u222a B| is as small as possible, then 200 minus that would be as large as possible.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. The maximum number of students who neither attended the prom nor debated would occur when the number of students who attended either or both is as small as possible. Because the more students you have in A \u222a B, the fewer you have outside. So to maximize the neither group, I need to minimize the number in A \u222a B.\n\nSo how do I find the minimum possible |A \u222a B|?\n\nI know that the minimum possible |A \u222a B| occurs when the overlap between A and B is as large as possible. Because |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|. So if |A \u2229 B| is as big as possible, |A \u222a B| is as small as possible.\n\nWait, but what's the maximum possible overlap? The maximum possible |A \u2229 B| is the smaller of |A| and |B|. Because you can't have more overlap than the size of the smaller set.\n\nSo first, let's calculate the minimum number of students in each event. 45% of 200 is 90, so at least 90 students attended the prom. Similarly, 35% of 200 is 70, so at least 70 students debated.\n\nSo |A| \u2265 90, |B| \u226570. The maximum possible |A \u2229 B| would be the smaller of 90 and 70, which is 70. So if 70 students are in both A and B, then |A \u222a B| would be 90 +70 -70 = 90.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because if 70 are in both, then A has 90, with 70 overlapping. So the union is 90 + (70-70) =90. Hmm, but that would mean the union is 90, which is the size of A.\n\nWait, but wait, if B is entirely within A, then the union is just 90. Because all 70 in B are already in A.\n\nBut is that possible? Let me think. Since |A| is 90 and |B| is 70, if B is a subset of A, then the union is 90. So that would be the minimal possible union.\n\nSo |A \u222a B| can be as low as 90. Therefore, the number of students who didn't attend either is 200 - 90 = 110. But wait, wait, that's one of the options. Option E is 110.\n\nBut hold on, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because the question says \"at least 45%\" and \"at least 35%\". So maybe |A| could be larger than 90, but we're looking for the minimal union, so we take the minimal |A| and |B|. Because to minimize the union, we have to take the smallest possible |A| and |B|.\n\nWait, no, actually, the minimal union occurs when the overlap is maximum. So taking the minimal |A| and |B| is correct because if |A| or |B| were larger, the overlap could be larger, but in this case, since we're considering the minimal |A| and |B|, the maximum overlap is limited by those numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it another way. The maximum possible overlap is the minimum of the two percentages. So, 45% is 90, and 35% is 70. So the maximum overlap is 70, meaning that all of B is included in A. So the union is 90. So the number of students who attended either or both is 90. Therefore, the number who didn't attend either is 200 -90=110.\n\nBut wait, is that possible? Because if 90 attended the prom and 70 debated, and all 70 of the debaters were also prom attendees, then the union is 90. So yes, 200-90=110.\n\nSo the maximum number of students who could have neither is 110, which is option E.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option E is 110, which is the same as the number of prom attendees. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have two sets, the union can't be less than the larger of the two individual sets. In this case, the larger is 90, so the union can't be less than 90. So 90 is indeed the minimum possible union.\n\nSo the maximum number of students who neither attended nor debated is 110.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about 200 students in a school. The question is about figuring out the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor participated in the debating session. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nAlright, the problem says that at least 45% attended the prom, and at least 35% took part in the debating session. I'm trying to find the maximum number who didn't do either. So, I guess I need to use some principles from set theory or maybe the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nWait, right. The inclusion-exclusion principle is about the union of two sets. The formula is |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|. But since I'm looking for the number of students who didn't attend either, that's the complement of A \u222a B, so 200 minus |A \u222a B|.\n\nBut to maximize the number of students who neither attended the prom nor debated, I need to minimize |A \u222a B|. Because if |A \u222a B| is as small as possible, then 200 minus that would be as large as possible.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. The maximum number of students who neither attended the prom nor debated would occur when the number of students who attended either or both is as small as possible. Because the more students you have in A \u222a B, the fewer you have outside. So to maximize the neither group, I need to minimize the number in A \u222a B.\n\nSo how do I find the minimum possible |A \u222a B|?\n\nI know that the minimum possible |A \u222a B| occurs when the overlap between A and B is as large as possible. Because |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|. So if |A \u2229 B| is as big as possible, |A \u222a B| is as small as possible.\n\nWait, but what's the maximum possible overlap? The maximum possible |A \u2229 B| is the smaller of |A| and |B|. Because you can't have more overlap than the size of the smaller set.\n\nSo first, let's calculate the minimum number of students in each event. 45% of 200 is 90, so at least 90 students attended the prom. Similarly, 35% of 200 is 70, so at least 70 students debated.\n\nSo |A| \u2265 90, |B| \u226570. The maximum possible |A \u2229 B| would be the smaller of 90 and 70, which is 70. So if 70 students are in both A and B, then |A \u222a B| would be 90 +70 -70 = 90.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because if 70 are in both, then A has 90, with 70 overlapping. So the union is 90 + (70-70) =90. Hmm, but that would mean the union is 90, which is the size of A.\n\nWait, but wait, if B is entirely within A, then the union is just 90. Because all 70 in B are already in A.\n\nBut is that possible? Let me think. Since |A| is 90 and |B| is 70, if B is a subset of A, then the union is 90. So that would be the minimal possible union.\n\nSo |A \u222a B| can be as low as 90. Therefore, the number of students who didn't attend either is 200 - 90 = 110. But wait, wait, that's one of the options. Option E is 110.\n\nBut hold on, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because the question says \"at least 45%\" and \"at least 35%\". So maybe |A| could be larger than 90, but we're looking for the minimal union, so we take the minimal |A| and |B|. Because to minimize the union, we have to take the smallest possible |A| and |B|.\n\nWait, no, actually, the minimal union occurs when the overlap is maximum. So taking the minimal |A| and |B| is correct because if |A| or |B| were larger, the overlap could be larger, but in this case, since we're considering the minimal |A| and |B|, the maximum overlap is limited by those numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it another way. The maximum possible overlap is the minimum of the two percentages. So, 45% is 90, and 35% is 70. So the maximum overlap is 70, meaning that all of B is included in A. So the union is 90. So the number of students who attended either or both is 90. Therefore, the number who didn't attend either is 200 -90=110.\n\nBut wait, is that possible? Because if 90 attended the prom and 70 debated, and all 70 of the debaters were also prom attendees, then the union is 90. So yes, 200-90=110.\n\nSo the maximum number of students who could have neither is 110, which is option E.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option E is 110, which is the same as the number of prom attendees. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have two sets, the union can't be less than the larger of the two individual sets. In this case, the larger is 90, so the union can't be less than 90. So 90 is indeed the minimum possible union.\n\nSo the maximum number of students who neither attended nor debated is 110.\n\n\nTo determine the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor participated in the debating session, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and focus on minimizing the number of students in the union of the two sets (prom attendees and debaters). \n\nGiven:\n- Total number of students = 200\n- At least 45% attended the prom, so \\(|A| \\geq 0.45 \\times 200 = 90\\).\n- At least 35% participated in the debate, so \\(|B| \\geq 0.35 \\times 200 = 70\\).\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion principle states:\n\\[\n|A \\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cap B|\n\\]\nTo minimize \\(|A \\cup B|\\), the overlap \\(|A \\cap B|\\) must be maximized. The maximum overlap is limited by the smaller of \\(|A|\\) and \\(|B|\\), which is 70. Thus, if all 70 debaters are also prom attendees, the union becomes:\n\\[\n|A \\cup B| = 90 + 70 - 70 = 90\n\\]\nThis means the number of students who attended either the prom, the debate, or both is at least 90. The number of students who neither attended the prom nor participated in the debate is:\n\\[\n200 - |A \\cup B| = 200 - 90 = 110\n\\]\nTherefore, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom nor the debate is **110**.\n\nAnswer: E",
