      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here: Add +45 and -30. Hmm, I remember that adding positive and negative numbers is like moving in opposite directions on a number line. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nWait, adding a positive and a negative number is the same as subtracting the smaller absolute value from the larger one and then taking the sign of the number with the larger absolute value. So, in this case, +45 is positive and -30 is negative. The absolute values are 45 and 30, right?\n\nOh right, so 45 is bigger than 30. So I subtract 30 from 45. Let me calculate that: 45 minus 30 is 15. Now, since 45 is positive and it's the larger number, the result should be positive. So the answer should be +15, which is option D.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the signs. Another way to think about it is combining them: +45 minus 30. 45 minus 30 is definitely 15. So yeah, D is correct. The other options don't make sense. Option E is -15, which would be if I subtracted 45 from 30, but that's not the case here. And the other options are either the same as one of the numbers or zero, which doesn't fit. So yeah, D is the right choice.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem of adding +45 and -30, we can approach it by considering the absolute values of the numbers and their signs. \n\n1. **Absolute Values**: The absolute values of +45 and -30 are 45 and 30, respectively.\n2. **Subtraction Rule**: Adding a positive and a negative number is equivalent to subtracting the smaller absolute value from the larger one. Here, 45 (larger) - 30 (smaller) = 15.\n3. **Sign Determination**: Since the positive number (+45) has the larger absolute value, the result will be positive.\n\nThus, the sum of +45 and -30 is +15.

Wait, right, because one is positive and the other is negative. So when you add them, it's the same as subtracting the smaller number from the larger one, but the sign depends on which has the bigger absolute value.\n\nLet me break it down. The two numbers are +45 and -30. So I can think of this as 45 minus 30 because the positive is larger. 45 minus 30 is 15. But wait, since both are adding, right? Oh wait, no, the question is to add them: +45 + (-30). Oh, right, that's the same as 45 minus 30. So 45-30 equals 15. So the result should be +15 because 45 is larger than 30.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Another way to think about it is on the number line. Starting at zero, if I go +45, I'm at 45. Then adding -30 is like moving 30 steps to the left. So 45 minus 30 is 15. So the answer is +15.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 15, so the answer should be D.\n",
