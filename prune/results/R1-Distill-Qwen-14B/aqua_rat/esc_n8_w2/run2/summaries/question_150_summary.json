      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about two trains crossing each other. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of problems, but let me try to think it through.\n\nAlright, the problem says Train M leaves City A at 5 am and arrives in City B at 9 am. So the total time it takes is 4 hours. That means the distance between the two cities is covered by Train M in 4 hours. I should probably figure out the speed of each train, but wait, I don't know the distance. Maybe I can assume the distance between A and B is some value, say D kilometers. Yeah, that's a common approach.\n\nSo for Train M, speed = distance/time. Since it leaves A at 5 am and arrives at B at 9 am, that's 4 hours. So speed of M is D/4 km per hour.\n\nNow, Train N leaves City B at 7 am and reaches City A at 10:30 am. Let me calculate the time it takes. From 7 am to 10:30 am is 3 and a half hours, which is 3.5 hours. So the speed of Train N is D divided by 3.5 hours. Let me write that as D/(3.5) or D/(7/2) which simplifies to 2D/7 km per hour.\n\nWait, but maybe I should calculate the exact time each train is moving when they might meet. Let me outline the timings.\n\nTrain M starts at 5 am, so by 7 am, it's been 2 hours on the road. So in those two hours, it would have covered a distance of (D/4) * 2 = D/2. So at 7 am, when Train N starts from B towards A, Train M is already D/2 away from A, which is the same as D/2 away from B. So the distance between the two trains at 7 am is D minus D/2, which is D/2.\n\nNow, both trains are moving towards each other. So their speeds add up. The relative speed is (D/4) + (2D/7). Let me compute that. To add them, find a common denominator, which is 28. So D/4 is 7D/28, and 2D/7 is 8D/28. Adding them together gives 15D/28 km per hour.\n\nThe distance between them at 7 am is D/2. So the time it takes for them to meet after 7 am is (D/2) divided by (15D/28). Let me compute that: (D/2) / (15D/28) = (D/2) * (28)/(15D) = (28)/(30) )= 14/15 hours. Wait, 14/15 hours? That's 56 minutes, because 14/15 of an hour is (14/15)*60 = 56 minutes.\n\nSo they meet 56 minutes after 7 am. 7 am plus 56 minutes is 7:56 am. But wait, the options don't have times but durations. Wait, the options are A)1 hr 23 min, etc. Wait, no, looking back: the options are labeled A to E, but the question asks at what time they cross. Wait, no, wait, the options are just time durations, like how long after a certain point. Wait, let me check the question again.\n\nWait the question says, \"At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?\" Oh, and the options are A)1 hr 23 min, etc. Wait, no, looking again: the options are labeled as time, but perhaps the options are in minutes after a certain starting point. Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check again.\n\nOptions:\nA)1 hr 23 min\nB)1 hr 15 min\nC)1 hr 8 min\nD)56 min\nE)55 min\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the time they cross each other. So the correct answer is 7:56 am, which is 56 minutes after 7 am. Looking at the options, option D is 56 min. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me double-check the calculations. Because sometimes these problems can have a twist.\n\nSo, the distance between the two trains at 7 am is D/2. The relative speed is (D/4 + 2D/7) = (7D +8D)/28 =15D/28. So time taken is (D/2)/(15D/28) = (D/2) * (28)/(15D) )= 14/15 hours, which is indeed 56 minutes. So 7 am plus 56 minutes is 7:56 am.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the time they cross, which would be 7:56 am. But the options are given as durations, not as times. Wait, wait, no, the options are written as time intervals, but the question is asking for the actual time they meet. So perhaps the options are in terms of how much after a certain point. But in the options, the times are in terms of minutes after 5 am? Or perhaps the options are in minutes since midnight? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options.\n\nWait, looking again: the options are:\n\nA)1 hr 23 min \u2192 83 minutes\n\nB)1 hr 15 min \u2192 75 minutes\n\nC)1 hr 8 min \u2192 68 minutes\n\nD)56 min \u219256\n\nE)55 min \u219255\n\nWait, but the actual time they meet is at 7:56 am, which is 56 minutes after 7 am, which is 7:56 am. Alternatively, in terms of minutes after midnight, 7 am is 420 minutes, plus 56 is 476 minutes. Alternatively, the time is 7:56 am, which can be expressed as 5 hours and 56 minutes after midnight. But none of the options directly give that.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are the time elapsed after the start of Train M's journey. Because Train M started at 5 am, so 7 am is 2 hours into its journey. The meeting time is 56 minutes after 7 am, which is 2 hours and 56 minutes after 5 am. 2 hours is 120 minutes, plus 56 is 176 minutes. 176 minutes is 2 hours 56 minutes, which is 2:56 hours, but that's not one of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are the time elapsed after the start of Train N's journey. Train N starts at 7 am. So the meeting time is 56 minutes after that. So the time is 56 minutes. Which is option D.\n\nSo the answer is D)56 min.\n",

I should probably figure out the speed of each train, but wait, I don't know the distance. Maybe I can assume the distance between A and B is some value, say D kilometers. Yeah, that's a common approach.\n\nSo for Train M, speed = distance/time. Since it leaves A at 5 am and arrives at B at 9 am, that's 4 hours. So speed of M is D/4 km per hour.\n\nNow, Train N leaves City B at 7 am and reaches City A at 10:30 am. Let me calculate the time it takes. From 7 am to 10:30 am is 3 and a half hours, which is 3.5 hours. So the speed of Train N is D divided by 3.5 hours. Let me write that as D/(3.5) or D/(7/2) which simplifies to 2D/7 km per hour.\n\nWait, but maybe I should calculate the exact time each train is moving when they might meet. Let me outline the timings.\n\nTrain M starts at 5 am, so by 7 am, it's been 2 hours on the road. So in those two hours, it would have covered a distance of (D/4) * 2 = D/2. So at 7 am, when Train N starts from B towards A, Train M is already D/2 away from A, which is the same as D/2 away from B. So the distance between the two trains at 7 am is D minus D/2, which is D/2.\n\nNow, both trains are moving towards each other. So their speeds add up. The relative speed is (D/4) + (2D/7). Let me compute that. To add them, find a common denominator, which is 28. So D/4 is 7D/28, and 2D/7 is 8D/28. Adding them together gives 15D/28 km per hour.\n\nThe distance between them at 7 am is D/2. So the time it takes for them to meet after 7 am is (D/2) divided by (15D/28). Let me compute that: (D/2) / (15D/28) = (D/2) * (28)/(15D) = (28)/(30) )= 14/15 hours. Wait, 14/15 hours? That's 56 minutes, because 14/15 of an hour is (14/15)*60 = 56 minutes.\n\nSo they meet 56 minutes after 7 am. 7 am plus 56 minutes is 7:56 am. But wait, the options don't have times but durations.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about two trains crossing each other. Hmm, let's see. I remember that these kinds of problems usually involve calculating when two objects moving towards each other meet. I think I should start by figuring out the speeds and the time each train is on the track.\n\nSo, train M leaves City A at 5 am and arrives at City B at 9 am. That means it took 4 hours to travel from A to B. So, the total time for M is 4 hours. Now, train N leaves City B at 7 am and arrives at City A at 10:30 am. Let me calculate how long N took. From 7 am to 10:30 am is 3.5 hours, right? Because 10:30 minus 7 is 3 hours and 30 minutes, which is 3.5 hours.\n\nWait, but since both trains are moving towards each other, I think their speeds are important. Oh, but wait, do I know the distance between the cities? The problem doesn't give me the distance directly. Hmm, maybe I can assume the distance is the same for both trains since they're traveling between the same two cities. Let me call the distance D.\n\nSo, the speed of train M would be D divided by the time it took, which is 4 hours. So speed M = D/4.\n\nSimilarly, train N's speed is D divided by 3.5 hours. So speed N = D/(3.5). Alternatively, 3.5 is 7/2, so D/(7/2) is 2D/7. So speed N is 2D/7.\n\nWait, but maybe I should convert 3.5 hours into minutes to make it easier. Wait, no, maybe it's better to work with hours as it is.\n\nNow, I need to figure out when they meet. Let's think about their positions over time.\n\nWait, when do they start moving? Train M starts at 5 am, and N starts at 7 am. So, by the time N starts moving, M has already been on the tracks for 2 hours. Because from 5 to 7 am is 2 hours. So in those 2 hours, how far has M traveled? M's speed is D/4 per hour. So in 2 hours, M would have covered (D/4)*2 = D/2. So M is halfway to City B when N starts moving.\n\nSo, at 7 am, when N starts, M is at D/2 from City A, and N is at City B, starting to move towards A. Wait, no, N is starting from City B, right? So the distance between M and N at 7 am is D - D/2 = D/2. Because M has covered half the distance.\n\nNow, from 7 am onwards, both trains are moving towards each other. So their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. Because when two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is speed M + speed N.\n\nSo, speed M is D/4 per hour, speed N is 2D/7 per hour.\n\nWait, let me compute that. Let me find a common denominator or something. D/4 + 2D/7. To add these, find the least common denominator. 4 and 7's LCD is 28. So D/4 is 7D/28, and 2D/7 is 8D/28. Adding them gives 15D/28 per hour.\n\nSo their combined speed is 15D/28 per hour.\n\nThe distance between them at 7 am is D/2. So the time taken for them to meet after 7 am is the distance divided by the relative speed.\n\nTime = (D/2) / (15D/28) = (D/2) * (28/(15D)) = (28)/(30) = 14/15 hours.\n\nWait, 14/15 hours. Let me convert that to minutes. 14/15 * 60 = 56 minutes. So 56 minutes after 7 am, they meet.\n\nWait, 7 am plus 56 minutes is 7:56 am. But looking at the options, I don't see 7:56. The options are given as time durations, not specific times. Oh wait, the options are labeled as A to E, and each is a duration. Wait, no, looking back, the options are labeled as \"1 hr 23 min\", etc., but the question is asking for the time when they cross each other. Hmm, maybe the options are in terms of time after a certain point, but wait the question says \"At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?\" So the answer should be a specific time.\n\nWait, but in the options, the choices are like \"1 hr 23 min\" which would be 1h23m after a certain point. Wait, perhaps the problem is set in such a way that the time is relative to 5 am or something. Alternatively, perhaps the options are given in minutes past a certain time. Hmm, but the options are all in terms of time durations, which doesn't make sense. Oh, wait, perhaps the options are the time taken from when N starts, which is 7 am. But no, the options are A to E as 55 min, etc., but perhaps I should re-examine.\n\nWait, no, the options are presented as the time when they cross, but in the problem statement, perhaps the options are the time difference, but no, the question says \"at what time do the 2 trains cross one another?\" So the answer is a specific time, but the options are written as time durations, which is confusing. Wait, looking at the options:\n\nOptions:\nA)1 hr 23 min\nB)1 hr 15 min\nC)1 hr 8 min\nD)56 min\nE)55 min\n\nWait, that's not possible. Because the answer would be a time like 7:56 am, but the options are in terms of minutes, but perhaps the options are the time after 5 am? Let me think.\n\nWait, the problem says \"at what time do the 2 trains cross one another?\" So, the time is when they meet. So, the correct time is 7:56 am, which is 1 hour and 56 minutes after 5 am? No, because from 5 to 7 is 2 hours, then 56 minutes. So total from 5 am is 2 hours 56 minutes. But that's not one of the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the time. Let me go back.\n\nWait, the time they meet is 56 minutes after 7 am, which is 7:56 am. So, from 5 am, that's 2 hours and 56 minutes. But the options are in terms of 56 minutes, which is option D. Hmm, but perhaps the options are the time after the start of one of the trains. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"at what time do the two trains cross one another?\" So the answer is 7:56 am. But the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps I should calculate it differently.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the relative speed calculation. Let me recheck.\n\nSpeed of M: D/4 per hour.\n\nSpeed of N: D/(3.5) per hour. 3.5 hours is 7/2, so D/(7/2) is 2D/7 per hour.\n\nSo, when they're moving towards each other, the relative speed is D/4 + 2D/7.\n\nConvert to same denominator: 7D/28 + 8D/28 = 15D/28 per hour.\n\nAt 7 am, the distance between them is D/2.\n\nSo, time to meet is (D/2) / (15D/28) = (D/2) * (28/(15D)) = (28)/(30) = 14/15 hours.\n\n14/15 hours is 56 minutes (since 14/15 *60=56). So, 56 minutes after 7 am is 7:56 am.\n\nBut looking at the options, option D is 56 min. So perhaps the question is asking for the duration after 7 am, which is 56 minutes, so option D is correct.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the time, not the duration. So perhaps the options are incorrect, but according to the way the options are given, option D is 56 min, which would be the correct answer if the question is asking for the time after 7 am. Or perhaps the options are in terms of minutes past 5 am.\n\nWait, 7:56 am is 2 hours and 56 minutes after 5 am. But the options don't have that. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the time they meet.\n\nWait another approach: Let me represent the positions of the trains as functions of time.\n\nLet\u2019s set t=0 as 5 am.\n\nTrain M starts at t=0 and takes 4 hours to reach B, so it's position as a function of time is x_M(t) = (D/4) * t, for t between 0 and 4 hours.\n\nTrain N starts at t=2 hours (7 am) and takes 3.5 hours to reach A, so its position function is x_N(t) = D - (D/3.5) * (t-2), for t >=2.\n\nWe need to find t when x_M(t) = x_N(t).\n\nSo:\n\n(D/4) * t = D - (D/3.5) * (t-2)\n\nDivide both sides by D:\n\nt/4 = 1 - (t-2)/3.5\n\nMultiply both sides by 28 (the least common multiple of 4 and 3.5) to eliminate denominators:\n\n7t = 28 - 8(t-2)\n\n7t = 28 -8t +16\n\n7t +8t = 44\n\n15t =44\n\nt=44/15 hours.\n\n44/15 hours is 2.9333 hours, which is 2 hours and 56 minutes.\n\nSo, t is 2 hours and 56 minutes after 5 am, which is 7:56 am.\n\nBut the options are in terms of durations, like 56 minutes. So perhaps the intended answer is 56 minutes after 7 am, which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are the time in minutes past 5 am, but 2 hours is 120 minutes, plus 56 is 176 minutes, which isn't any of the options. So that can't be.\n\nWait, the options don't have 7:56 am, but option D is 56 minutes. So perhaps the correct answer is D) 56 min.\n\nBecause the meeting time is 56 minutes after 7 am. So the answer is D.\n",

At this point, the distance between the two trains is \\( D - \\frac{D}{2} = \\frac{D}{2} \\).\n\n4. From 7:00 am onward, both trains move toward each other. Their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Relative Speed} = \\frac{D}{4} + \\frac{2D}{7} = \\frac{7D}{28} + \\frac{8D}{28} = \\frac{15D}{28}.\n   \\]\n\n5. The time taken for the trains to meet after 7:00 am is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Relative Speed}} = \\frac{\\frac{D}{2}}{\\frac{15D}{28}} = \\frac{D}{2} \\cdot \\frac{28}{15D} = \\frac{28}{30} = \\frac{14}{15} \\text{ hours}.\n   \\]\n\n6. Converting \\( \\frac{14}{15} \\) hours to minutes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{14}{15} \\times 60 = 56 \\text{ minutes}.\n   \\]\n\nThus, the trains cross each other 56 minutes after 7:00 am, which corresponds to 7:56 am. Among the options provided, the correct answer is **56 minutes**, which matches option D.\n\nAnswer: D",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about two trains crossing each other. Hmm, let's see. I remember that these kinds of problems usually involve calculating when two objects moving towards each other meet. I think I should start by figuring out the speeds and the time each train is on the track.\n\nSo, train M leaves City A at 5 am and arrives at City B at 9 am. That means it took 4 hours to travel from A to B. So, the total time for M is 4 hours. Now, train N leaves City B at 7 am and arrives at City A at 10:30 am. Let me calculate how long N took. From 7 am to 10:30 am is 3.5 hours, right? Because 10:30 minus 7 is 3 hours and 30 minutes, which is 3.5 hours.\n\nWait, but since both trains are moving towards each other, I think their speeds are important. Oh, but wait, do I know the distance between the cities? The problem doesn't give me the distance directly. Hmm, maybe I can assume the distance is the same for both trains since they're traveling between the same two cities. Let me call the distance D.\n\nSo, the speed of train M would be D divided by the time it took, which is 4 hours. So speed M = D/4.\n\nSimilarly, train N's speed is D divided by 3.5 hours. So speed N = D/(3.5). Alternatively, 3.5 is 7/2, so D/(7/2) is 2D/7. So speed N is 2D/7.\n\nWait, but maybe I should convert 3.5 hours into minutes to make it easier. Wait, no, maybe it's better to work with hours as it is.\n\nNow, I need to figure out when they meet. Let's think about their positions over time.\n\nWait, when do they start moving? Train M starts at 5 am, and N starts at 7 am. So, by the time N starts moving, M has already been on the tracks for 2 hours. Because from 5 to 7 am is 2 hours. So in those 2 hours, how far has M traveled? M's speed is D/4 per hour. So in 2 hours, M would have covered (D/4)*2 = D/2. So M is halfway to City B when N starts moving.\n\nSo, at 7 am, when N starts, M is at D/2 from City A, and N is at City B, starting to move towards A. Wait, no, N is starting from City B, right? So the distance between M and N at 7 am is D - D/2 = D/2. Because M has covered half the distance.\n\nNow, from 7 am onwards, both trains are moving towards each other. So their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. Because when two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is speed M + speed N.\n\nSo, speed M is D/4 per hour, speed N is 2D/7 per hour.\n\nWait, let me compute that. Let me find a common denominator or something. D/4 + 2D/7. To add these, find the least common denominator. 4 and 7's LCD is 28. So D/4 is 7D/28, and 2D/7 is 8D/28. Adding them gives 15D/28 per hour.\n\nSo their combined speed is 15D/28 per hour.\n\nThe distance between them at 7 am is D/2. So the time taken for them to meet after 7 am is the distance divided by the relative speed.\n\nTime = (D/2) / (15D/28) = (D/2) * (28/(15D)) = (28)/(30) = 14/15 hours.\n\nWait, 14/15 hours. Let me convert that to minutes. 14/15 * 60 = 56 minutes. So 56 minutes after 7 am, they meet.\n\nWait, 7 am plus 56 minutes is 7:56 am. But looking at the options, I don't see 7:56. The options are given as time durations, not specific times. Oh wait, the options are labeled as A to E, and each is a duration. Wait, no, looking back, the options are labeled as \"1 hr 23 min\", etc., but the question is asking for the time when they cross each other. Hmm, maybe the options are in terms of time after a certain point, but wait the question says \"At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?\" So the answer should be a specific time.\n\nWait, but in the options, the choices are like \"1 hr 23 min\" which would be 1h23m after a certain point. Wait, perhaps the problem is set in such a way that the time is relative to 5 am or something. Alternatively, perhaps the options are given in minutes past a certain time. Hmm, but the options are all in terms of time durations, which doesn't make sense. Oh, wait, perhaps the options are the time taken from when N starts, which is 7 am. But no, the options are A to E as 55 min, etc., but perhaps I should re-examine.\n\nWait, no, the options are presented as the time when they cross, but in the problem statement, perhaps the options are the time difference, but no, the question says \"at what time do the 2 trains cross one another?\" So the answer is a specific time, but the options are written as time durations, which is confusing. Wait, looking at the options:\n\nOptions:\nA)1 hr 23 min\nB)1 hr 15 min\nC)1 hr 8 min\nD)56 min\nE)55 min\n\nWait, that's not possible. Because the answer would be a time like 7:56 am, but the options are in terms of minutes, but perhaps the options are the time after 5 am? Let me think.\n\nWait, the problem says \"at what time do the 2 trains cross one another?\" So, the time is when they meet. So, the correct time is 7:56 am, which is 1 hour and 56 minutes after 5 am? No, because from 5 to 7 is 2 hours, then 56 minutes. So total from 5 am is 2 hours 56 minutes. But that's not one of the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the time. Let me go back.\n\nWait, the time they meet is 56 minutes after 7 am, which is 7:56 am. So, from 5 am, that's 2 hours and 56 minutes. But the options are in terms of 56 minutes, which is option D. Hmm, but perhaps the options are the time after the start of one of the trains. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"at what time do the two trains cross one another?\" So the answer is 7:56 am. But the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps I should calculate it differently.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the relative speed calculation. Let me recheck.\n\nSpeed of M: D/4 per hour.\n\nSpeed of N: D/(3.5) per hour. 3.5 hours is 7/2, so D/(7/2) is 2D/7 per hour.\n\nSo, when they're moving towards each other, the relative speed is D/4 + 2D/7.\n\nConvert to same denominator: 7D/28 + 8D/28 = 15D/28 per hour.\n\nAt 7 am, the distance between them is D/2.\n\nSo, time to meet is (D/2) / (15D/28) = (D/2) * (28/(15D)) = (28)/(30) = 14/15 hours.\n\n14/15 hours is 56 minutes (since 14/15 *60=56). So, 56 minutes after 7 am is 7:56 am.\n\nBut looking at the options, option D is 56 min. So perhaps the question is asking for the duration after 7 am, which is 56 minutes, so option D is correct.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the time, not the duration. So perhaps the options are incorrect, but according to the way the options are given, option D is 56 min, which would be the correct answer if the question is asking for the time after 7 am. Or perhaps the options are in terms of minutes past 5 am.\n\nWait, 7:56 am is 2 hours and 56 minutes after 5 am. But the options don't have that. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the time they meet.\n\nWait another approach: Let me represent the positions of the trains as functions of time.\n\nLet\u2019s set t=0 as 5 am.\n\nTrain M starts at t=0 and takes 4 hours to reach B, so it's position as a function of time is x_M(t) = (D/4) * t, for t between 0 and 4 hours.\n\nTrain N starts at t=2 hours (7 am) and takes 3.5 hours to reach A, so its position function is x_N(t) = D - (D/3.5) * (t-2), for t >=2.\n\nWe need to find t when x_M(t) = x_N(t).\n\nSo:\n\n(D/4) * t = D - (D/3.5) * (t-2)\n\nDivide both sides by D:\n\nt/4 = 1 - (t-2)/3.5\n\nMultiply both sides by 28 (the least common multiple of 4 and 3.5) to eliminate denominators:\n\n7t = 28 - 8(t-2)\n\n7t = 28 -8t +16\n\n7t +8t = 44\n\n15t =44\n\nt=44/15 hours.\n\n44/15 hours is 2.9333 hours, which is 2 hours and 56 minutes.\n\nSo, t is 2 hours and 56 minutes after 5 am, which is 7:56 am.\n\nBut the options are in terms of durations, like 56 minutes. So perhaps the intended answer is 56 minutes after 7 am, which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are the time in minutes past 5 am, but 2 hours is 120 minutes, plus 56 is 176 minutes, which isn't any of the options. So that can't be.\n\nWait, the options don't have 7:56 am, but option D is 56 minutes. So perhaps the correct answer is D) 56 min.\n\nBecause the meeting time is 56 minutes after 7 am. So the answer is D.\n\n\nTo determine the time at which the two trains cross each other, we analyze their movements:\n\n1. **Train M** leaves City A at 5:00 am and reaches City B at 9:00 am, taking 4 hours. Its speed is \\( \\frac{D}{4} \\), where \\( D \\) is the distance between the cities.\n\n2. **Train N** leaves City B at 7:00 am and reaches City A at 10:30 am, taking 3.5 hours. Its speed is \\( \\frac{D}{3.5} = \\frac{2D}{7} \\).\n\n3. By 7:00 am, Train M has already been traveling for 2 hours and has covered half the distance, \\( \\frac{D}{2} \\). At this point, the distance between the two trains is \\( D - \\frac{D}{2} = \\frac{D}{2} \\).\n\n4. From 7:00 am onward, both trains move toward each other. Their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Relative Speed} = \\frac{D}{4} + \\frac{2D}{7} = \\frac{7D}{28} + \\frac{8D}{28} = \\frac{15D}{28}.\n   \\]\n\n5. The time taken for the trains to meet after 7:00 am is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Relative Speed}} = \\frac{\\frac{D}{2}}{\\frac{15D}{28}} = \\frac{D}{2} \\cdot \\frac{28}{15D} = \\frac{28}{30} = \\frac{14}{15} \\text{ hours}.\n   \\]\n\n6. Converting \\( \\frac{14}{15} \\) hours to minutes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{14}{15} \\times 60 = 56 \\text{ minutes}.\n   \\]\n\nThus, the trains cross each other 56 minutes after 7:00 am, which corresponds to 7:56 am. Among the options provided, the correct answer is **56 minutes**, which matches option D.\n\nAnswer: D",
