      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to solve this age-related problem. Let me read it again and understand what's being asked. \n\nThe problem says: Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back. How old is Ajay today if Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years?\n\nHmm. So, I think I need to set up some variables to represent their current ages and then form equations based on the given information.\n\nLet me think about the timeline. First, let's denote the current ages. Let\u2019s say today, Sachin is S years old and Ajay is A years old.\n\nThe first part of the problem says that Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years ago. So, 10 years ago, Sachin's age would have been S - 10, and Ajay's age would have been A - 10. According to the problem, at that time, Sachin's age was twice Ajay's. So that gives the equation:\n\nS - 10 = 2 * (A - 10)\n\nOkay, that's equation one.\n\nThe second part says that Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years. That means, in 10 years, Sachin's age will be S + 10, which equals 40. So,\n\nS + 10 = 40\n\nFrom this equation, I can solve for S. Let me do that.\n\nSubtracting 10 from both sides: S = 40 -10 = 30. So Sachin is currently 30 years old.\n\nNow that I know S is 30, I can plug that back into the first equation to find A.\n\nSo substituting S = 30 into equation one:\n\n30 - 10 = 2*(A -10)\n\nWhich simplifies to 20 = 2*(A -10)\n\nDivide both sides by 2: 10 = A -10\n\nAdding 10 to both sides: A = 20.\n\nWait, so Ajay is 20 years old today. Let me double-check that.\n\n10 years ago, Sachin was 30-10=20, and Ajay was 20-10=10. Oh right, 20 is twice of 10. That fits the first condition.\n\nAnd in 10 years, Sachin will be 30+10=40, which matches the second condition. So yes, Ajay is 20 today.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 20. So the answer should be D.\n",

From the second statement:  \n   Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years.  \n   \\[\n   S + 10 = 40 \\implies S = 30\n   \\]  \n   So, Sachin is currently 30 years old.\n\n2.

That makes sense because Sachin was twice as old as Ajay back then.\n\nThen, the problem also states that Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years. Wait, that means today, Sachin's age is 40 minus 10, right? Because if in 10 years he'll be 40, then now he must be 30. So Sachin's current age is 30.\n\nWait, wait. Let me make sure. If someone is X years old now, in 10 years they'll be X+10. So if X+10 =40, then X=30. Yep, so Sachin is 30 today.\n\nNow, how old is Ajay today? Let's go back to the past. 10 years ago, Sachin was 30-10=20 years old. Because today he's 30, so 10 years ago, he was 20. \n\nAt that time, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay.

Option D is 20, so that should be the answer.\n\nWait, let me recheck everything to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\n- Sachin's future age: 40 in 10 years.
