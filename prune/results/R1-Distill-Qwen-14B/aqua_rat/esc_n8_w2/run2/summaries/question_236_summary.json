      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about calculating the cost of B bottles of soda if 27 bottles cost A cents. Hmm, I need to find out how much B bottles would cost in dollars. \n\nFirst, I think I should find the cost per bottle in cents. Because if 27 bottles cost A cents, then each bottle must cost A divided by 27 cents. Let me write that down: cost per bottle = A / 27 cents.\n\nNow, I want to find out the cost for B bottles. So, I multiply the cost per bottle by B. That would be (A/27) * B cents. So, that's (AB)/27 cents for B bottles.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the cost in dollars, right? Oh, right! Because the answer options are in terms of dollars, not cents. So I need to convert cents to dollars. I remember that 1 dollar is 100 cents. So to get the amount in dollars, I have to divide the total cents by 100.\n\nSo the total cost in dollars is (AB/27) / 100. Let me compute that: AB divided by 27, then divided by 100. Which is the same as AB/(27*100) = AB/2700 dollars. \n\nLooking at the options, option A is AB/2700. So that must be the correct answer. Let me double-check. \n\nAnother approach: Let's say 27 bottles cost A cents. So the price per bottle is A/27 cents. For B bottles, it's B*(A/27) cents. To convert to dollars, divide by 100. So (AB)/(27*100) = AB/2700. Yep, that's the same as before.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option A.\n",

Let me read it again: If 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, how much will B bottles cost in dollars? Hmm, alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I think I should find out the cost per bottle. Because if 27 bottles cost A cents, then each bottle must cost A divided by 27 cents. So, per bottle is A/27 cents. That makes sense. But wait, the question is about B bottles, right? So I need to find out the total cost for B bottles.\n\nSo for B bottles, the cost would be B multiplied by the cost per bottle. Which would be B * (A/27) cents. But wait, the question asks for the cost in dollars, not cents. Oh right, because the answer needs to be in dollars, I need to convert cents to dollars. I remember that 1 dollar is 100 cents, so to convert cents to dollars, I divide by 100.\n\nSo putting it all together: total cost in dollars is (B * A / 27) / 100. Let me write that as a formula: (A * B) / (27 * 100). Which simplifies to AB/(2700). So the formula is AB divided by 2700.\n\nNow, looking at the options, option A is AB/2700. So that should be the correct choice. Let me check the other options to be sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nOption B: 27/(AB). That would be the reciprocal of AB/27, which doesn't fit. Because if A increases, the cost should increase, but this option would decrease as A increases. So no.\n\nOption C: AB/270. Wait, that's similar but the denominator is 270 instead of 2700. Oh, because I forgot to divide by 100? Because 270 is 27*10, but we have 27*100. So option C is 10 times larger than the correct value. So that's wrong.\n\nOption D: 2700/AB. That's the reciprocal of AB/2700. So if A or B increases, this would decrease. But if I have more bottles, the cost should go up, so this can't be right.\n\nOption E: 100AB/27. Let me calculate: (100AB)/27. Wait, that's like taking (AB/27) and then multiplying by 100. Which would be converting cents to dollars without dividing by 100, which is incorrect. Wait no, if you have (AB/27) cents, that's (AB/27) / 100 dollars. So option E is (100AB)/27, which is way larger. So that's not correct.\n\nSo the only option that matches AB/(2700) is option A.\n",
