      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about converting the weight of a cat food bag from pounds and ounces to just ounces. Hmm, I remember that pounds and ounces are units of weight, and I need to convert the pounds part into ounces first. \n\nWait, right, I think there are 16 ounces in a pound. So, if the bag is 7 pounds and 4 ounces, I should convert the 7 pounds into ounces and then add the remaining 4 ounces. Let me write that down.\n\nSo, 7 pounds times 16 ounces per pound. Let me calculate that. 7 * 16. Hmm, 7 times 10 is 70, and 7 times 6 is 42. So 70 plus 42 is 112. Oh wait, so 7 pounds is 112 ounces. Then I have the additional 4 ounces. So adding those together: 112 + 4 equals 116 ounces total.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 116. So that should be the correct answer. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up pounds and ounces. No, the question says the bag is 7 pounds and 4 ounces, so converting pounds to ounces and adding makes sense. Yep, that's right. So the answer should be C.\n",
