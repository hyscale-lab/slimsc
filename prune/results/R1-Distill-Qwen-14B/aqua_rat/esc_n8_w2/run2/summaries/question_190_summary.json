      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a cereal mixture. Let me see what it's asking. The ratio of rice, wheat, and corn is 2:3:5. And the bag has 3 pounds of rice. I need to find out how much corn is in the bag.\n\nHmm, ratios can sometimes trip me up, but I think I get the basic idea. Ratios are about parts relative to each other. So the total parts would be the sum of all the parts. Let me add them up: 2 (rice) + 3 (wheat) +5 (corn) equals 10 parts in total.\n\nWait, so each \"part\" is a certain amount of weight, right? And the bag has 3 pounds of rice. Since rice is 2 parts, each part must be 3 divided by 2. Let me calculate that: 3 /2 = 1.5 pounds per part.\n\nNow, I need to find out how much corn there is. Corn is 5 parts. So if each part is 1.5 pounds, then 5 parts would be 5 *1.5. Let's do that math: 5 times 1.5 is 7.5 pounds. So the bag should have 7.5 pounds of corn.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 7.5. So that should be the answer. But wait, let me double-check. The ratio is 2:3:5, which adds to 10. Rice is 2 parts, so 3 pounds is 2 parts. So each part is 1.5. Corn is 5 parts, so 5 *1.5 is 7.5. Yep, that's correct. So the answer should be B.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a cereal mixture. Let me read it again. The mixture has rice, wheat, and corn in the ratio of 2:3:5. A bag has 3 pounds of rice, and I need to find out how much corn it contains.\n\nHmm, ratios can sometimes be tricky, but I think I get the basics. Ratios compare the quantities of different components. So here, rice to wheat to corn is 2:3:5. That means for every 2 parts of rice, there are 3 parts wheat and 5 parts corn.\n\nWait, so the total ratio parts would be 2 + 3 +5. Let me add that up: 2+3 is 5, plus 5 makes 10. So the total parts are 10.\n\nBut how does that relate to the actual pounds? The bag has 3 pounds of rice. Oh, right, because the ratio is parts of each. So 2 parts correspond to 3 pounds of rice.\n\nI think I can set up a proportion here. If 2 parts equal 3 pounds, then each part is 3 divided by 2, which is 1.5 pounds per part. Oh wait, let me write that down: 2 parts = 3 lbs \u2192 1 part = 3/2 = 1.5 lbs.\n\nSo, now I can find out how much corn there is. Corn is 5 parts. So 5 parts times 1.5 pounds per part. Let me calculate that: 5 * 1.5. Hmm, 5 times 1 is 5, 5 times 0.5 is 2.5. So 5 +2.5 is 7.5 pounds.\n\nLooking at the options, B is 7.5. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The ratio is 2:3:5, which sums to 10. So each part is 3/2. So rice is 2*(3/2)=3, wheat is 3*(3/2)=4.5, corn is 5*(3/2)=7.5. Yep, that's correct. So the corn is 7.5 pounds.\n",
