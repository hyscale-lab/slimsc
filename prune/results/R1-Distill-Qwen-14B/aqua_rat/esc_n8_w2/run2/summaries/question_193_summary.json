      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to find a two-digit number that meets certain conditions. Let me break it down step by step. \n\nThe problem says: A two-digit number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. Also, the digit in the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place. I need to find which of the options (A to E) is the correct number.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the problem better. Let's denote the two-digit number. Normally, a two-digit number can be written as 10*a + b, where 'a' is the digit in the ten's place and 'b' is the digit in the unit's place. For example, if the number is 42, then a=4 and b=2.\n\nThe first condition is that the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. So, mathematically, this can be written as:\n10a + b = (a + b) + 18.\n\nSimplifying that equation: 10a + b = a + b + 18. If I subtract (a + b) from both sides, I get 9a = 18. Dividing both sides by 9 gives a = 2. So the ten's digit is 2.\n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check that. 10a + b minus (a + b) equals 18. So 10a + b - a - b = 9a = 18. Yep, that gives a=2. So the ten's digit is 2.\n\nThe second condition says that the unit's digit is double the ten's digit. So, b = 2*a. Since a is 2, then b=4. So the number is 10*2 +4 =24. Let me see if that's one of the options. Option B is 24.\n\nWait, but let me check if this satisfies the first condition. The sum of the digits is 2+4=6. The number is 24. 24 -6 =18. Yes, that works. So 24 seems to fit.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake. Let's look at all the options to see if any others fit.\n\nOption A: 12. The sum of digits is 1+2=3. 12-3=9, which is not 18. So A is out.\n\nOption B: 24. As above, it works.\n\nOption C:42. Sum is 4+2=6. 42-6=36. Not 18. So no.\n\nOption D:48. Sum is 4+8=12. 48-12=36. Not 18.\n\nOption E:49. Sum is 4+9=13. 49-13=36. Also not 18.\n\nSo the only number that fits is 24, which is option B.\n\nWait a minute, but I just thought of something. The way I set up the equation was correct, right? Let me recheck the setup. The number is 10a +b. Sum of digits is a +b. The number exceeds the sum by 18, so 10a +b = (a +b) +18. Yep, that's right. So 9a=18, a=2. Then b=4. So number is 24.\n\nBut wait, another thought: what if I made a mistake in interpreting the problem? Let me reread it.\n\n\"A two-digit number exceeds the sum of the digits of that number by 18.\" So number is greater than the sum by 18. So number = sum +18. That's what I used. So yes, correct.\n\nAnd the unit digit is double the ten's digit. So b=2a. So that's right.\n\nSo I think I'm confident that the answer is B)24.\n",

I need to find which number it is from the options given.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. First, I'll represent the two-digit number. Since it's a two-digit number, I can think of it as having a ten's place and a unit's place. Let's say the digit in the ten's place is 'a' and the unit's digit is 'b'. So, the number itself can be written as 10a + b. For example, if a is 3 and b is 4, the number is 34.\n\nThe first condition says the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. So, the sum of the digits is a + b, and the number is (10a + b). So the equation would be: (10a + b) = (a + b) + 18. Let me write that down:\n\n10a + b = (a + b) + 18\n\nSimplify that equation. Subtract (a + b) from both sides:\n\n10a + b - a - b = 18\n9a = 18\n\nOh, so 9a = 18. Solving for a, I divide both sides by 9:\n\na = 18 / 9\na = 2\n\nSo the ten's digit is 2. Now, the second condition says the unit's digit is double the ten's digit. So b = 2 * a. Since a is 2, b would be 4.\n\nSo the digits are a=2 and b=4. That makes the number 24. Wait, but looking at the options, B is 24. But let me double-check because sometimes I might make a mistake.\n\nWait, let me plug this back into the original condition to make sure. The number is 24. The sum of the digits is 2 + 4 = 6. The number 24 minus 6 should be 18. 24 -6 is 18. Yes, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option C is 42. Let me see why that might be a contender. Because sometimes when I write the number, I might mix up the digits. So if a is the ten's digit, which is 2, and b is 4, then 10a + b is 24. So 24 is correct. But wait, another approach: maybe I should check all the options to see if any fit the conditions.\n\nLet me check each option:\n\nOption A) 12: Sum of digits 1+2=3. 12 -3=9. Not 18. So no.\n\nOption B) 24: Sum is 6. 24-6=18. Yes, correct. Also, the unit digit is 4, which is double the ten's digit (2*2=4). So this fits both conditions.\n\nOption C)42: Sum is 4+2=6. 42-6=36. Not 18. So no.\n\nOption D)48: Sum is 4+8=12. 48-12=36. Not 18.\n\nOption E)49: Sum is 4+9=13. 49-13=36. Not 18.\n\nSo only option B fits both conditions. So the answer should be B)24.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because another thought: in the problem statement, the number is a two-digit number.
