      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where Jack buys 18 sharpeners, both white and brown, for a total of 100 rupees. He pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than for each brown one. I need to figure out how many white and brown sharpeners he bought. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nWait, the question says he buys 18 sharpeners in total. So the number of white plus the number of brown sharpeners equals 18. Let me write that down as an equation. Let me denote the number of white sharpeners as W and the number of brown ones as B. So, W + B = 18. Got that.\n\nNow, the total cost is 100 rupees. Each white sharpener costs more than each brown by 1 rupee. So, the cost per white sharpener is (cost per brown) + 1. Let me think about how to model this. Let's say the cost of each brown sharpener is x rupees. Then each white would cost x + 1 rupees.\n\nSo the total cost would be (number of white) * (x+1) + (number of brown) * x = 100. Substituting W and B, that becomes W*(x+1) + B*x = 100.\n\nBut I know that W + B = 18, so I can express one variable in terms of the other. Let's say B = 18 - W. Then substituting into the cost equation: W*(x+1) + (18 - W)*x = 100.\n\nLet me expand that. Wx + W + 18x - Wx = 100. Oh, wait, the Wx and -Wx terms cancel out. So I'm left with W + 18x = 100.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So W + 18x = 100. But I have two variables here, W and x. I need another equation to solve this. Wait, perhaps I can express x in terms of W or vice versa.\n\nWait, but maybe I can find integer solutions because the number of sharpeners must be whole numbers. Let's see. Let me rearrange the equation: 18x = 100 - W.\n\nSince W is the number of white sharpeners, it must be a positive integer, and so must x. So 100 - W must be divisible by 18? Because 18x is 100 - W, so x = (100 - W)/18.\n\nWait, x has to be an integer because the cost per brown sharpener is in whole rupees, right? Or maybe not necessarily, but the options given are all integers, so perhaps x is an integer.\n\nSo (100 - W) must be a multiple of 18. Let me think about possible W values that satisfy this.\n\nLooking at the options, the possible W values are 10,9,7,5,11. Let's compute 100 - W for each:\n\nOption A: W=10 \u2192 100-10=90. 90 /18=5 \u2192 x=5. So each brown is 5, white is 6. Let's check the total cost: 10*6 + 8*5 = 60 +40=100. Oh, that adds up. So this option seems correct.\n\nWait, but I should check all options to make sure. Let's see.\n\nOption B: W=9 \u2192 100-9=91. 91/18 is about 5.055\u2026 which isn't an integer. So x would be 5.055, which isn't a whole number. So this option is probably incorrect.\n\nOption C: W=7 \u2192 100-7=93. 93/18=5.166\u2026 again, not an integer. So x isn't an integer here. So this can't be.\n\nOption D: W=5 \u2192 100-5=95. 95/18\u22485.277\u2026 not integer. So no.\n\nOption E: W=11 \u2192 100-11=89. 89/18\u22484.944\u2026 nope.\n\nSo only option A gives an integer value for x. So W=10, B=8. The total cost would be 10*(5+1) + 8*5 = 60 +40=100. Yep, that works.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I make any mistakes in the setup? Because sometimes these problems can have a twist.\n\nWait, the problem states that he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown. So per unit, white is x+1, brown is x. So the setup seems correct.\n\nSo yeah, the correct answer is option A: 10 white and 8 brown.\n",

Also, he pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than each brown one. Hmm, I need to find out how many white and brown sharpeners he bought.\n\nWait, let's break it down. Let me assign variables to make it easier. Let me say the number of white sharpeners is W and the number of brown ones is B. So, from the problem, we know two things:\n\n1. The total number of sharpeners is 18. So, W + B = 18.\n2. The total cost is 100 rupees. But here's the twist: each white sharpener costs 1 rupee more than each brown one. So, if I let the cost of a brown sharpener be x rupees, then a white one would be x + 1 rupees.\n\nSo, the total cost equation would be: W*(x+1) + B*x = 100.\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n\n1. W + B = 18\n2. W*(x+1) + B*x = 100.\n\nHmm, but wait, I have three variables here: W, B, and x. Oh, but maybe I can express W and B in terms of each other from the first equation. Like, W = 18 - B. Then substitute that into the second equation.\n\nLet me try that. Substitute W = 18 - B into the cost equation:\n\n(18 - B)*(x + 1) + B*x = 100.\n\nExpanding that:\n\n18*(x+1) - B*(x+1) + B*x = 100.\n\nLet me compute each part. 18*(x+1) is 18x + 18. Then, -B*(x+1) is -Bx - B. Adding B*x gives -Bx - B + Bx, which simplifies to -B.\n\nSo putting it all together: 18x +18 - B = 100.\n\nNow, the equation becomes 18x + 18 - B = 100.\n\nWait, I can rearrange this to 18x - B = 82. Because 100-18 is 82.\n\nBut from the first equation, I know that B = 18 - W. Wait, but perhaps it's easier to express B in terms of x here.\n\nWait, let's see. So, from 18x - B =82, we can write B = 18x -82.\n\nBut wait, since B is the number of brown sharpeners, it has to be a positive integer, right? Also, W must be positive as well, so 18 - B must be positive. So, B must be less than 18.\n\nHmm, let's think about possible integer values for x. Because the cost per sharpeners has to be a positive integer, right? Or does it? Wait, the problem doesn't specify that x is an integer. Hmm, but looking at the options, the total number of sharpeners is 18, and the cost is 100, so x could be a non-integer. But perhaps the answer options suggest that W and B are integers, but x might not have to be.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can find x in terms of B or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find another equation. Wait, but I have two equations and three variables. Oh wait, but perhaps I can find another relation. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express the total cost equation in terms of W and B. Let me see.\n\nWait, another approach. Let me think about the cost per sharpener. Let me denote the cost of brown as x, so white is x+1. So, the total cost is W*(x+1) + B*x = 100.\n\nBut I also have W = 18 - B. So substituting that:\n\n(18 - B)*(x+1) + B*x = 100.\n\nExpanding this:\n\n18x + 18 - Bx - B + Bx = 100.\n\nWait, the Bx and -Bx cancel out. So we're left with 18x + 18 - B = 100.\n\nSo, 18x - B = 82.\n\nHmm, so 18x = B +82.\n\nBut B is the number of brown sharpeners, which must be a positive integer less than 18.\n\nSo, let's rearrange: B = 18x -82.\n\nWait, but B must be positive. So, 18x -82 >0 \u2192 18x >82 \u2192 x>82/18 \u2192 which is approximately 4.555... So x must be greater than about 4.555.\n\nBut x is the cost per brown sharpener, so maybe it's a small integer, but not necessarily.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can find integer values of x that make B an integer as well.\n\nWait, B =18x -82. So, 18x must be such that B is a positive integer less than 18.\n\nSo, let's see, possible x values.\n\nLet me try x=5. Then B=18*5 -82=90-82=8. So B=8.\n\nThen W=18-8=10.\n\nSo, W=10, B=8. Let's check the cost: 10*(5+1) +8*5 =10*6=60 +40=100. Yep, that works.\n\nWait, but let's see if there are other possible x values. Let's try x=6.\n\nB=18*6 -82=108-82=26. But 26 is more than 18, which isn't possible since B can't be more than 18. So x=6 is too high.\n\nWhat about x=4? B=18*4 -82=72-82= -10. Negative, which isn't possible. So x must be 5.\n\nSo, the solution is W=10, B=8.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 10,8. So the answer should be A.\n",

So, 18x must be such that B is a positive integer less than 18.\n\nSo, let's see, possible x values.\n\nLet me try x=5. Then B=18*5 -82=90-82=8. So B=8.\n\nThen W=18-8=10.\n\nSo, W=10, B=8. Let's check the cost: 10*(5+1) +8*5 =10*6=60 +40=100. Yep, that works.\n\nWait, but let's see if there are other possible x values. Let's try x=6.\n\nB=18*6 -82=108-82=26. But 26 is more than 18, which isn't possible since B can't be more than 18. So x=6 is too high.\n\nWhat about x=4? B=18*4 -82=72-82= -10. Negative, which isn't possible. So x must be 5.\n\nSo, the solution is W=10, B=8.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 10,8. So the answer should be A.\n\n\nJack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for a total of 100 rupees. He pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than each brown sharpener. To solve the problem, let:\n\n- \\( W \\) = number of white sharpeners  \n- \\( B \\) = number of brown sharpeners  \n- \\( x \\) = cost of one brown sharpener (in rupees).  \n\nFrom the problem, we have two key equations:  \n1. \\( W + B = 18 \\) (total number of sharpeners)  \n2. \\( W(x + 1) + Bx = 100 \\) (total cost).  \n\nSubstituting \\( W = 18 - B \\) from the first equation into the second equation gives:  \n\\[\n(18 - B)(x + 1) + Bx = 100.\n\\]  \nExpanding and simplifying:  \n\\[\n18x + 18 - Bx - B + Bx = 100.\n\\]  \nThe \\( -Bx \\) and \\( Bx \\) terms cancel, leaving:  \n\\[\n18x + 18 - B = 100.\n\\]  \nRearranging gives:  \n\\[\n18x - B = 82.\n\\]  \nFrom this, \\( B = 18x - 82 \\). Since \\( B \\) must be a positive integer less than 18, \\( x \\) must also be an integer. Testing \\( x = 5 \\):  \n\\[\nB = 18(5) - 82 = 90 - 82 = 8.\n\\]  \nThus, \\( W = 18 - B = 18 - 8 = 10 \\). Verifying the total cost:  \n\\[\nW(x + 1) + Bx = 10(5 + 1) + 8(5) = 10(6) + 40 = 60 + 40 = 100.\n\\]  \nThis satisfies the conditions. Testing other values of \\( x \\) (e.g., \\( x = 6 \\) or \\( x = 4 \\)) results in \\( B \\) being either too large or negative, which is not possible. Therefore, the only valid solution is \\( W = 10 \\) and \\( B = 8 \\).  \n\nThe correct answer is **A) 10, 8**.  \n\nAnswer: A",
