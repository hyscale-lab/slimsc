      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about an organization raising money through employee contributions. \n\nAlright, the problem says they wanted to raise Rs. 6 lakh. Each employee contributes equally. Then, if each employee had contributed Rs.60 extra, the total would have been Rs.6.24 lakh. I need to find the number of employees.\n\nWait, let me make sure I understand. So, the original target is 6,00,000 rupees. Each employee contributes the same amount, let's call that 'x' per employee. The number of employees is 'n'. So, the equation would be n times x equals 6 lakh, right? So, n * x = 600,000.\n\nThen, if each contributes Rs.60 more, each contributes (x + 60). And the total in that case is 6.24 lakh, which is 624,000. So, n*(x+60) = 624,000.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1. n * x = 600,000\n2. n*(x + 60) = 624,000\n\nI can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate the n*x term. Let's see:\n\nn*(x +60) - n*x = 624,000 - 600,000\nn*x +60n - n*x = 24,000\nSo, 60n = 24,000.\n\nHmm, solving for n. So, 60n =24000. Divide both sides by 60. n = 24000 /60. Let me calculate that. 24000 divided by 60. 60 goes into 240 four times, so 24000/60 is 400. So, n=400.\n\nWait, so the number of employees is 400? Looking at the options, option C is 400. So that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. If there are 400 employees, the original contribution per person is x = 600000/400 = 1500. Then, if each contributes 60 more, that's 1560 each. 400 *1560 = 624,000. Yep, that matches. So the calculation is correct.\n",

Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe problem says that an organization decided to raise Rs. 6 lakh by collecting equal contributions from each employee. Then, if each employee had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the total contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. The question is asking how many employees are in the organization. The options are A) 300, B) 200, C)400, D)100, E)500.\n\nHmm, alright, so I think I can set up some equations here. Let me denote the number of employees as N. And let's say each employee contributes X rupees. So the total contribution is N multiplied by X, and that should equal 6 lakh. So the first equation is:\n\nN * X = 6,00,000.\n\nWait, wait, 6 lakh is 600,000. So N times X equals 600,000.\n\nThen, the second scenario is that each employee contributes 60 rupees more. So each contributes X + 60. And the total becomes 6.24 lakh, which is 624,000. So the second equation is:\n\nN * (X + 60) = 624,000.\n\nNow I have two equations:\n\n1) N * X = 600,000\n2) N * (X + 60) = 624,000.\n\nI think I can subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to find out something. Let me try that.\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\nN*(X +60) - N*X = 624,000 - 600,000.\n\nSimplify the left side: N*X + 60N - N*X = 60N.\n\nRight side: 24,000.\n\nSo 60N = 24,000.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So 60 multiplied by N equals 24,000.\n\nSo to find N, I can divide both sides by 60.\n\nN = 24,000 / 60.\n\nLet me calculate that. 24,000 divided by 60.\n\nHmm, 60 times 400 is 24,000. Because 60 * 400 is 24,000.\n\nSo N equals 400.\n\nWait, so the number of employees is 400. Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nSo using N=400, from the first equation, X is 600,000 / 400 = 1500. So each employee contributes 1500 rupees.\n\nThen, if each contributes 60 more, that's 1560 per employee. Multiply by 400: 1560 * 400.\n\nLet me compute that: 1560 * 400. Well, 156 * 4 = 624, so 1560 *400 is 624,000. Yep, that matches the second condition.\n\nSo the correct answer must be 400 employees, which is option C.\n",
