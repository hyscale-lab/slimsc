      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit nervous because word problems can sometimes be tricky, but I'll take it slow.\n\nThe question is about the number of students in a class based on their interests in different games. Let's break down the information given.\n\nFirst, it says 8% of the total students are interested in Football. Hmm, percentages can be a bit confusing, but I'll remember that percentage means per hundred. So if the total number of students is, say, N, then 8% would be 0.08 * N.\n\nThen, it says 4/5 of the total students are interested in Cricket. Wait, 4/5 is the same as 0.8, right? So that's 0.8 * N students interested in Cricket.\n\nNext, 10% of the students are interested in Basketball. Again, that's 0.10 * N.\n\nAnd then there's the remaining group: 20 students who aren't interested in any of these games. So these are the students who don't play any of Football, Cricket, or Basketball.\n\nThe question is asking for the total number of students, which I'll call N. So I need to set up an equation that adds up all these parts and equals N.\n\nWait a minute, but wait. I should make sure that the percentages and fractions don't overlap. Like, are there students who are interested in more than one game? The problem doesn't specify, so I think we can assume that each student is only counted once, perhaps? Or maybe it's better to think that these are separate groups. Hmm, but the way the problem is phrased, it's talking about the percentages of the total students interested in each sport. So the sum of all these percentages plus the remaining 20 should equal 100% of N, right?\n\nWait, no. Because 8% + 4/5 (which is 80%) + 10% equals 98%. Then the remaining 2% (or is it 20 students) would be those not interested in any games.\n\nSo let's calculate the sum of the given percentages:\n\n8% (Football) + 80% (Cricket) + 10% (Basketball) = 98%.\n\nSo the remaining percentage is 100% - 98% = 2%. And this 2% corresponds to the 20 students who aren't interested in any games.\n\nSo if 2% of N equals 20 students, then I can set up the equation:\n\n0.02 * N = 20.\n\nTo find N, I can rearrange this:\n\nN = 20 / 0.02.\n\nCalculating that, 20 divided by 0.02. Let me think: 0.02 is 2/100, so dividing by 2/100 is the same as multiplying by 100/2. So 20 * (100/2) = 20 * 50 = 1000.\n\nWait, so N would be 1000 students. Let me check the options. Option E is 1000. So is that the answer?\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's compute each group:\n\n8% of 1000 is 80 students interested in Football.\n\n4/5 of 1000 is 800 students for Cricket.\n\n10% of 1000 is 100 students for Basketball.\n\nAdding those up: 80 + 800 + 100 = 980.\n\nThen the remaining students: 1000 - 980 = 20, which matches the given condition. So yeah, that seems right.\n\nSo the total number of students is 1000, which is option E.\n",

And the remaining 20 students aren't interested in any games. We need to find out how many students are in the class.\n\nWait, let's see. So, we're looking for the total number of students, let's call that T. Because all the percentages and fractions are based on T, right?\n\nSo, let's break down the information:\n\n1. Football: 8% of T \u2192 0.08*T\n2. Cricket: 4/5 of T \u2192 0.8*T (because 4/5 is 0.8)\n3. Basketball: 10% of T \u2192 0.10*T\n4. Remaining students: 20, who aren't interested in any.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Are these percentages overlapping? Like, can a student be interested in more than one game? The problem doesn't say anything about that. Hmm. So maybe I should assume that the 20 students are the ones not interested in any of the three, and the rest are interested in at least one. Or maybe the percentages are exclusive. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nBut the way the problem is phrased, it just says the remaining 20 aren't interested in any. So I think the first three groups (Football, Cricket, Basketball) plus the 20 add up to the total T.\n\nWait, no. Because if each of those groups includes some students, but some students might be in more than one group, then simply adding them up would cause overlaps. But wait, the problem doesn't specify any overlaps. So maybe I'm supposed to assume that each student is only counted in one of these categories. Hmm, that's a big assumption. But without more information, perhaps that's the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 20 are the remaining after all the others are accounted for, regardless of overlaps. But that's not clear. Hmm.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's think of the total as the sum of the students interested in each game plus the 20. But that would only be correct if each student is only interested in one game. But since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps that's the case. So maybe:\n\nTotal students = Football + Cricket + Basketball + 20.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because if some students are interested in more than one, then adding them up would count those students multiple times. So that approach would be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is designed so that the sum of the percentages is 8% + 4/5 (which is 80%) +10% = 98% of T. So 98% of T are interested in at least one game, and the remaining 2% are the 20 students. Hmm, that makes sense. Because 8% + 80% is 88%, plus 10% is 98%. So 98% of T are in at least one game, so 2% of T are the 20 students not interested in any.\n\nSo, 2% of T = 20. Let me calculate that.\n\nSo, 2% is 20. So, 2% = 0.02*T =20.\n\nSo, solving for T: T = 20 / 0.02 = 1000.\n\nSo, the total number of students would be 1000.
