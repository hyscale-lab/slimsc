      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about two ants moving towards each other. Let me think through it step by step. Hmm, the ants are named A and B. Ant A moves at 9 cm per hour, and ant B at 6 cm per hour. Their farms are 75 cm apart. I need to find out how far ant A travels before they meet.\n\nWait, right. When two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. So, the combined speed here would be 9 + 6 = 15 cm per hour. That makes sense because they're approaching each other, so their speeds add up.\n\nNow, the total distance between them is 75 cm. So, the time it takes until they meet should be the total distance divided by their combined speed. Let me calculate that. Time equals distance over speed, so 75 divided by 15 is 5 hours. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait a second, 75 divided by 15 is 5? Let me check: 15 times 5 is 75, yes, that's right. So, they meet after 5 hours.\n\nWait, no, wait a minute. Wait, no, 15 cm per hour multiplied by 5 hours is 75 cm, right. So, yes, time is 5 hours. Now, I need to find the distance that ant A travels in that time.\n\nAnt A's speed is 9 cm per hour, so distance equals speed multiplied by time. So, 9 cm/hour * 5 hours = 45 cm. So, ant A would have traveled 45 cm before they meet.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 45. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Let me double-check. Ant A's speed is 9, so in 5 hours, 9*5=45. Ant B's speed is 6, so 6*5=30. Together, 45+30=75, which matches the initial distance. So yes, that's correct. So the answer should be A)45.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the distance that ant A travels before meeting ant B, we start by calculating their combined speed.

Since they're moving towards each other, the time until they meet can be found by dividing the total distance by their combined speed.

If Ant A goes 45 cm and Ant B goes 6 cm/h *5h=30 cm, then together they cover 45+30=75 cm, which matches the total distance. That makes sense. So the answer should be 45 cm.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 45. So I think the correct answer is A.\n",
