      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question is: If 10 is subtracted from two-thirds of a number, the result is equal to the sum of 40 and one-third of the number. I need to find the number.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. Let's say the number is x. So, two-thirds of the number would be (2/3)x. Then, 10 is subtracted from that. So that part is (2/3)x - 10.\n\nOn the other side of the equation, the sum of 40 and one-third of the number is 40 + (1/3)x. So putting it all together, the equation is:\n\n(2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x\n\nWait, that makes sense. Now, I need to solve for x. Let me rearrange the equation to get all the x terms on one side and constants on the other.\n\nFirst, I can subtract (1/3)x from both sides to get rid of it on the right. So:\n\n(2/3)x - (1/3)x - 10 = 40\n\nSimplifying the x terms: (2/3 - 1/3)x is (1/3)x. So now the equation is:\n\n(1/3)x - 10 = 40\n\nNext, I'll add 10 to both sides to isolate the term with x:\n\n(1/3)x = 50\n\nNow, to solve for x, I can multiply both sides by 3:\n\nx = 50 * 3\nx = 150\n\nSo the number should be 150. Looking at the options, option C is 150. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me plug x = 150 back into the original equation.\n\nLeft side: (2/3)*150 -10. 2/3 of 150 is 100, so 100 -10 =90.\n\nRight side: 40 + (1/3)*150. 1/3 of 150 is 50, so 40 +50=90.\n\nYes, both sides equal 90. That checks out. So the correct answer should be C) 150.\n",

Let's say the number is x. So, two-thirds of the number would be (2/3)x. Then, 10 is subtracted from that.

Let me read it again to make sure I understand what it's asking.\n\nThe problem says: If 10 is subtracted from two-thirds of a number, the result is equal to the sum of 40 and one-third of the number. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful, but I think I can break it down.\n\nLet me denote the unknown number as x. So, the first part of the problem says, \"10 is subtracted from two-thirds of a number.\" Translating that into an equation, two-thirds of x is (2/3)x, and subtracting 10 from that would be (2/3)x - 10.\n\nThe second part says, \"the result is equal to the sum of 40 and one-third of the number.\" So, one-third of the number is (1/3)x, and adding 40 to that gives 40 + (1/3)x.\n\nPutting it all together, the equation becomes: (2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x. Now, I need to solve for x.\n\nWait, let me make sure I got the equation right. So, two-thirds x minus 10 equals 40 plus one-third x. Yeah, that sounds right.\n\nNow, to solve for x, I can try to get all the x terms on one side and the constants on the other. Let's subtract (1/3)x from both sides to get rid of it on the right. So, subtracting (1/3)x from both sides:\n\n(2/3)x - (1/3)x - 10 = 40.\n\nSimplifying the x terms: (2/3 - 1/3)x is (1/3)x. So, (1/3)x - 10 = 40.\n\nNow, I can add 10 to both sides to isolate the x term. Adding 10:\n\n(1/3)x = 50.\n\nTo solve for x, I multiply both sides by 3. So, x = 50 * 3 = 150.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the steps because sometimes signs can be tricky. Let me go through it again.\n\nStarting equation: (2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x.\n\nSubtract (1/3)x from both sides: (2/3 - 1/3)x - 10 = 40.\n\nWhich gives (1/3)x -10 =40.\n\nAdding 10 to both sides: (1/3)x = 50.\n\nMultiply both sides by 3: x=150.\n\nSo that's 150. Let me check the options. Option C is 150. So I think that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, let me plug x=150 back into the original problem to see if it works.\n\nFirst part: two-thirds of 150 is (2/3)*150 = 100. Subtract 10: 100-10=90.\n\nSecond part: 40 plus one-third of 150. One-third is 50, so 40+50=90.\n\nYes, both sides equal 90. So the answer must be 150, which is option C.\n",
