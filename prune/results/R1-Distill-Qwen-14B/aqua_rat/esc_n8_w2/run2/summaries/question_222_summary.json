      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out Ajay's present age. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem says that if 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's current age, and then the remainder is divided by 18, we get Rahul's age. So, I can model that with an equation. Let me assign variables to each person's age to make it easier. Let me denote Ajay's age as A, Rahul's as R, and Denis's as D.\n\nWait, the problem also mentions that Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis. And Denis's age is given as 5 years. Oh wait, no, the problem says \"Denis whose age is 5 yrs.\" So, Denis is 5 years old? No, wait, I think I misread that. Let me check again. The problem says: \"If Rahul is 2 yrs younger to Denis whose age is 5 yrs...\" Oh, so Denis is 5 years old, and Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis. So Rahul's age would be 5 minus 2, which is 3 years old. Wait, that seems too young, but maybe that's correct.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because if Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, and Denis is 5, then Rahul would be 5 - 2 = 3. But that seems possible. Let me write that down.\n\nSo, Rahul's age R = 5 (Denis's age) minus 2 = 3. So R = 3.\n\nNow, the first part of the problem says that if 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's age (A) and the remainder is divided by 18, we get Rahul's age (R). So mathematically, that would be: (A - 6) / 18 = R.\n\nSince we know R is 3, we can plug that into the equation. So (A -6)/18 = 3.\n\nTo solve for A, multiply both sides by 18: A -6 = 3 * 18 = 54.\n\nThen, add 6 to both sides: A = 54 +6 = 60.\n\nSo Ajay's present age would be 60. Looking at the options, option B is 60. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nSo, if Ajay is 60, subtracting 6 gives 54. Dividing 54 by 18 is 3, which is Rahul's age. And Rahul is 3, which is indeed 2 years younger than Denis, who is 5. Yeah, that all adds up. \n\nI think that makes sense. So the answer is B) 60.\n",

Also, Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, whose age is 5 years. I need to find Ajay's present age.\n\nHmm, let's parse this. First, let's note down the given information.\n\nDenis's age is 5 years. So, Denis = 5.\n\nRahul is 2 years younger than Denis. So Rahul's age is Denis's age minus 2. So Rahul = 5 - 2 = 3 years old.\n\nNow, the first part connects Ajay's age to Rahul's.
