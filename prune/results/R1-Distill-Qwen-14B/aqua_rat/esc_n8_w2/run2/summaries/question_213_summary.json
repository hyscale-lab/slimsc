      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a survey John did on car colors. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking how many people took the survey. The options are A)100, B)120, C)50, D)200, E)80. \n\nAlright, let's break this down. The first piece of information is that 60% of the people surveyed were women. So that means the remaining 40% are men, right? Because 100% minus 60% is 40%. So if I let the total number of people be N, then the number of men is 0.4 * N, and women are 0.6 * N.\n\nNext part: Of the men surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars. Wait, but then it says that 10 men liked green cars more than red. Hmm. So let me think. If 75% of men prefer red, then the remaining percentage must prefer green. Because 100% minus 75% is 25%. So 25% of the men prefer green. \n\nSo, 25% of the men equals 10 men. Because 10 men liked green more than red. So mathematically, that would be 0.25 * (number of men) = 10. \n\nLet me write that as an equation. Let M be the number of men. So 0.25 * M =10. To find M, I can divide both sides by 0.25. So M = 10 / 0.25. What's 10 divided by 0.25? Well, 0.25 is a quarter, so 10 divided by a quarter is 40. Because 10 *4 =40. So M is 40. \n\nBut wait, M is the number of men, which is 40% of the total survey participants. Because earlier, 40% were men. So M = 0.4 * N. We found M is 40, so 0.4 * N =40. \n\nTo find N, I can divide both sides by 0.4. So N =40 / 0.4. Let's calculate that. 40 divided by 0.4 is the same as 40 * (10/4) because 0.4 is 4/10. 40 * (10/4) is 40 * 2.5, which is 100. So N is 100. \n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 100. So that's the answer? But wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me recap. If total N is 100, then 40% are men, so 40 men. 75% of 40 men prefer red. 75% of 40 is 30 men. So 30 prefer red, and 10 prefer green. Oh wait, that's exactly what the problem states: 10 men liked green more than red. So yes, that checks out. \n\nWait, but what if I messed up the percentages? Let me see. 75% prefer red, which leaves 25% for green. So 25% of 40 is 10, which matches. So yes, that's correct. So N is 100, which is option A. \n\nBut wait, another approach: sometimes when I do these percentage problems, I might confuse the overall percentage with the group. Let me make sure. So the 75% is of the men, not of the entire survey. So 75% of the men is red, 25% is green. So that's correct. \n\nSo the calculation steps seem solid. So the answer should be 100. Which is option A.\n",
