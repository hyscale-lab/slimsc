      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about calculating the maximum distance I can travel with $8.50 in a cab. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of problems, but let me try to work through it step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says the cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile. Then, each additional quarter mile costs 10 cents. Oh wait, so it's 10 cents per quarter mile after the first one. Right, I should remember that.\n\nSo I need to figure out how much money I have left after the initial charge and then see how many additional quarter miles I can get with that. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the total money I have is $8.50. The initial fare is $3.50, so I subtract that from the total. Let me do the math: 8.50 minus 3.50 equals... that's $5.00 left. So I have $5.00 to spend on the additional quarter miles.\n\nEach additional quarter mile is 10 cents. Wait, 10 cents is $0.10. So how many of these can I afford with $5.00? I think I need to divide the remaining money by the cost per quarter mile. So 5.00 divided by 0.10. Let me calculate that: 5 divided by 0.1 is 50. So 50 times 0.10 is $5. So yes, 50 quarter miles.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The first quarter mile is already included in the initial $3.50 charge. So the 50 quarter miles I'm calculating are the additional ones after the first. So the total distance is the initial quarter mile plus 50 more quarter miles.\n\nSo the total number of quarter miles is 1 plus 50, which is 51. Now, each quarter mile is 0.25 miles, right? So I multiply 51 by 0.25 to get the total distance in miles.\n\nLet me do that multiplication. 51 times 0.25. Well, 50 times 0.25 is 12.5, and 1 times 0.25 is 0.25. So adding them together gives 12.75 miles.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes when I'm dealing with money and units, it's easy to make a mistake. So initial charge: $3.50, so left with $5. Each extra quarter mile is $0.10, so 5 / 0.10 = 50. So 50 quarter miles. So 50 * 0.25 = 12.5 miles. Plus the initial quarter mile, which is 0.25, so 12.5 + 0.25 is 12.75 miles. Yep, that seems right.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 12.75 miles. So I think that's the correct answer.\n",

The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and then 10 cents for each additional quarter mile. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the total amount of money I have to spend. That's $8.50. The initial charge is $3.50, which covers the first quarter-mile. So I need to figure out how much money is left after that initial charge. \n\nSo, subtracting $3.50 from $8.50 gives me $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00 left. \n\nNow, each additional quarter-mile costs 10 cents. Wait, 10 cents is $0.10. So I need to find out how many quarter-miles I can buy with the remaining $5.00.\n\nTo find the number of additional quarter-miles, I'll divide the remaining money by the cost per quarter-mile. That would be $5.00 / $0.10 = 50. So that's 50 quarter-miles. \n\nWait, each of those is a quarter-mile, right? So to get the total distance beyond the first quarter-mile, I multiply the number of quarter-miles by 0.25 miles. So 50 * 0.25 = 12.5 miles. \n\nBut wait, that's just the additional distance.
