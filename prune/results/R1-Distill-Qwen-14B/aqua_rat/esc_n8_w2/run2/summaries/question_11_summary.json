      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully. The company makes 420 units every month, each costing them $110 to produce. They sell all of them each month. I need to find the minimum selling price per component so that their yearly profit is at least $626,400. Hmm, right.\n\nSo, profit is calculated as revenue minus costs. Let me break this down. First, let's figure out the monthly costs and revenue, then scale it up to a year.\n\nEach month, the company produces 420 units. The production cost per unit is $110. So the monthly cost is 420 multiplied by 110. Let me compute that. 420 * 110 = 46,200. So every month, they spend $46,200 on production.\n\nNow, the revenue depends on the selling price. Let's call the selling price 'p'. So each unit sold brings in 'p' dollars. Therefore, the monthly revenue is 420 * p.\n\nProfit for each month is revenue minus cost. So profit per month is (420p) - 46,200. \n\nBut the problem asks for the yearly profit to be at least $626,400. So I need to calculate the total profit over 12 months and set it equal to 626,400.\n\nWait, no, not exactly equal. It needs to be at least 626,400, so the profit per month multiplied by 12 should be >= 626,400.\n\nSo, let's compute the total profit for the year. Let's denote the profit per month as P. So P = (420p - 46,200). The total for a year is 12P = 12*(420p -46,200). This needs to be >= 626,400.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to calculate the required profit per month and then solve for p.\n\nSo, the total required yearly profit is 626,400. Dividing that by 12 gives the required monthly profit. Let's compute that: 626400 / 12 = 52,200. So each month, they need to make at least $52,200 profit.\n\nSo the equation becomes: (420p - 46,200) >= 52,200.\n\nLet me solve for p. Adding 46,200 to both sides:\n\n420p >= 52,200 + 46,200.\n\n52,200 plus 46,200 is 98,400. So,\n\n420p >= 98,400.\n\nDivide both sides by 420:\n\np >= 98,400 / 420.\n\nLet me compute that. Hmm, 98,400 divided by 420. Let me see. 420 goes into 98400 how many times?\n\nWell, 420 * 200 is 84,000. Subtract that from 98,400: 14,400 left.\n\n420 * 34 is 14,280 (since 420*30=12,600, 420*4=1,680; 12,600+1,680=14,280). So 200 +34 = 234, and 14,400 -14,280 is 120.\n\nSo 98,400 = 420 * 234 + 120. Wait, that's not exact. Alternatively, perhaps I can do this division more accurately.\n\nWait, 420 * 234 = 420*(200+34) = 84,000 + (420*34). Let me compute 420 *34: 400*34=13,600, 20*34=680 \u2192 13,600+680=14,280. So 84,000 +14,280=98,280. So 98,400 -98,280=120. So 98,400 = 420 *234 + 120.\n\nSo 98,400 /420 =234 + 120/420 =234 + 2/7 \u2248234.2857.\n\nSo p must be at least approximately 234.2857 dollars.\n\nLooking at the options, the choices are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nSo the minimum p is around 234.29, so the smallest option higher than that is B)230? Wait, wait, no. Because 230 is less than 234.29. So that's not enough. The next higher option is C)240. So 240 would be the minimum selling price to meet the required profit.\n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check my calculations. Because if I get p=234.2857, then 230 is lower than that, so the company would not meet the required profit if they set the price at 230. Therefore, the correct option must be C)240.\n\nWait, but let me re-express the equation to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me re-derive.\n\nYearly profit >=626,400.\n\nYearly profit is 12*(monthly revenue - monthly cost).\n\nMonthly cost is 420 *110 =46,200.\n\nSo, 12*(420p -46200) >=626,400.\n\nDivide both sides by 12:\n\n420p -46200 >=52,200.\n\n420p >=52,200 +46,200 =98,400.\n\np >=98400 /420.\n\nLet me compute 98400 \u00f7420.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 60: 98400 \u00f760=1640, 420 \u00f760=7.\n\nSo 1640/7 = ?\n\n7*234=1638. So 234 and 2/7, as before.\n\nSo p must be at least approximately 234.2857.\n\nLooking at the options, the options are:\n\nA)226 \u2192 too low\n\nB)230 \u2192 still below 234.2857, so not sufficient.\n\nC)240 \u2192 yes, that's higher than 234.28, so this would work.\n\nSo the minimal price is C)240.\n",

Hmm, right.\n\nSo, profit is calculated as revenue minus costs. Let me break this down. First, let's figure out the monthly costs and revenue, then scale it up to a year.\n\nEach month, the company produces 420 units. The production cost per unit is $110. So the monthly cost is 420 multiplied by 110. Let me compute that. 420 * 110 = 46,200. So every month, they spend $46,200 on production.\n\nNow, the revenue depends on the selling price. Let's call the selling price 'p'. So each unit sold brings in 'p' dollars. Therefore, the monthly revenue is 420 * p.\n\nProfit for each month is revenue minus cost. So profit per month is (420p) - 46,200. \n\nBut the problem asks for the yearly profit to be at least $626,400. So I need to calculate the total profit over 12 months and set it equal to 626,400.\n\nWait, no, not exactly equal. It needs to be at least 626,400, so the profit per month multiplied by 12 should be >= 626,400.\n\nSo, let's compute the total profit for the year. Let's denote the profit per month as P. So P = (420p - 46,200). The total for a year is 12P = 12*(420p -46,200). This needs to be >= 626,400.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to calculate the required profit per month and then solve for p.\n\nSo, the total required yearly profit is 626,400. Dividing that by 12 gives the required monthly profit. Let's compute that: 626400 / 12 = 52,200. So each month, they need to make at least $52,200 profit.\n\nSo the equation becomes: (420p - 46,200) >= 52,200.\n\nLet me solve for p. Adding 46,200 to both sides:\n\n420p >= 52,200 + 46,200.\n\n52,200 plus 46,200 is 98,400. So,\n\n420p >= 98,400.\n\nDivide both sides by 420:\n\np >= 98,400 / 420.\n\nLet me compute that. Hmm, 98,400 divided by 420. Let me see. 420 goes into 98400 how many times?\n\nWell, 420 * 200 is 84,000. Subtract that from 98,400: 14,400 left.\n\n420 * 34 is 14,280 (since 420*30=12,600, 420*4=1,680; 12,600+1,680=14,280). So 200 +34 = 234, and 14,400 -14,280 is 120.\n\nSo 98,400 = 420 * 234 + 120. Wait, that's not exact. Alternatively, perhaps I can do this division more accurately.\n\nWait, 420 * 234 = 420*(200+34) = 84,000 + (420*34). Let me compute 420 *34: 400*34=13,600, 20*34=680 \u2192 13,600+680=14,280. So 84,000 +14,280=98,280. So 98,400 -98,280=120. So 98,400 = 420 *234 + 120.\n\nSo 98,400 /420 =234 + 120/420 =234 + 2/7 \u2248234.2857.\n\nSo p must be at least approximately 234.2857 dollars.\n\nLooking at the options, the choices are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nSo the minimum p is around 234.29, so the smallest option higher than that is B)230?

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out the minimum selling price per component that will ensure a yearly profit of at least $626,400. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the company produces 420 units every month. So, over a year, that's 12 months, right? Let me calculate the total number of units produced annually. 420 units/month * 12 months = 5040 units per year.\n\nEach component costs them $110 to produce. So, the total production cost per year is 5040 units * $110. Hmm, let me do that math. 5040 * 110... Well, 5000 * 110 is 550,000. 40 * 110 is 4,400. So total is 550,000 + 4,400 = $554,400.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the company sells all components each month, so each month's profit is revenue minus production cost for that month. Oh wait, but the question is about yearly profit. So maybe I should compute the total revenue minus total production cost over the year.\n\nRight, so the profit is total revenue minus total cost. They want this profit to be at least $626,400.\n\nLet me denote the selling price per component as S. Then, the revenue per month is 420 * S. So, the annual revenue would be 420*S*12.\n\nThe total production cost is 420 units/month * $110/month * 12 months? No, wait. Wait, no. Each month, they produce 420 units, each costing $110. So each month's cost is 420 * 110. So over 12 months, that's 420*110*12.\n\nSo total cost is 420 * 110 *12. Let me calculate that. 420*110 is 46,200. Multiply by 12: 46,200 *12 = 554,400. Yep, same as before.\n\nSo profit is (420 * S * 12) - (420 * 110 *12) >= 626,400.\n\nWait, but wait. Alternatively, since profit per month is (420*S - 420*110), and over 12 months, it's 12*(420*(S-110)) >= 626400.\n\nSo maybe it's easier to compute per month and then multiply by 12. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute the required equation.\n\nTotal revenue: 420 * S * 12.\n\nTotal cost: 420 * 110 *12.\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost = (420*12)*(S - 110) >= 626,400.\n\nSo 420*12 is 5040. So 5040*(S -110) >= 626,400.\n\nI can write this as:\n\n5040*(S - 110) >= 626400\n\nDivide both sides by 5040:\n\nS - 110 >= 626400 / 5040\n\nLet me compute 626400 divided by 5040. Hmm.\n\nWell, 5040 is 504*10. 504*10 = 5040.\n\nWhat's 626400 divided by 5040? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, I can simplify the division.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: 62640 / 504.\n\nLet me see, 504 goes into 62640 how many times?\n\n504 * 124 = ?\n\nWait, 504 * 120 = 60,480. 504 *4 =2016. So 504*124=60,480 + 2016= 62,496. Wait, 62,496 is less than 62,640. So 62,640 -62,496=144.\n\nSo 504*124=62,496. Then, 144 left. 504 goes into 144 about 0.2857 times. So 124.2857.\n\nWait, but 504 *124.2857=62,640?\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach. Let me compute 626400 divided by 5040.\n\nWait, 5040 * 124 = 5040*100=504000, 5040*24=120,960. So 504000 + 120,960=624,960.\n\n626,400 -624,960=1,440.\n\nSo 5040 * x =1,440.\n\nx=1,440 /5040 = 144/504 = 12/42= 2/7 \u22480.2857.\n\nSo 124 + 0.2857 \u2248124.2857.\n\nSo S -110 >= 124.2857.\n\nSo S >= 110 + 124.2857 \u2248 234.2857.\n\nSo S must be at least approximately $234.29.\n\nBut the options are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nWait, the options don't have 234. So the next higher option is 240. So the minimum price per component is $240.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute 626400 /5040 more accurately.\n\nLet me do it step by step.\n\nCompute 5040 into 626400.\n\n5040 * 124 = 624,960. Subtract that from 626,400: 626,400 -624,960 = 1,440.\n\nSo 5040 * x = 1,440. So x =1,440 /5040 = (1,440 \u00f7 1440)/(5040 \u00f71440) \u2192 wait no. Let me compute 1440 \u00f7 5040.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 720: 2 /7. So 2/7 is approximately 0.2857.\n\nSo 124 + 2/7 \u2248 124.2857.\n\nSo S must be >= 110 + 124.2857 \u2248234.2857.\n\nSo the minimum price per component is $234.29. But the options are in whole dollars. So the next higher option is $240.\n\nLooking at the options, C is 240, which would give a profit higher than required.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me compute the profit if S is 240.\n\nCompute annual revenue: 420 *240 *12.\n\nWait, 420 *240 = 100,800. Multiply by 12: 1,209,600.\n\nTotal cost: 420 *110 *12. 420*110=46,200. 46,200 *12=554,400.\n\nProfit: 1,209,600 -554,400 =655,200.\n\nWhich is more than 626,400. So that's acceptable.\n\nWhat about 230?\n\nCompute revenue:420 *230=96,600. *12= 1,159,200.\n\nCost:554,400.\n\nProfit:1,159,200 -554,400 =604,800. Which is less than 626,400. So 230 is not enough.\n\nWhat about 234.29? Let me compute.\n\nAt S=234.29:\n\nRevenue per month:420 *234.29= let's compute 420 *234 =98,  420 *234 = 98,280. 420 *0.29 =121.8. So total 98,280 +121.8=98,401.8 per month.\n\nAnnual revenue:98,401.8 *12=1,180,821.6.\n\nWait, wait, but that's not right because 234.29 is approximately 234.29, so maybe better to compute accurately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me recompute 626,400 /5040.\n\nWait, 5040 *124=624,960. 626,400-624,960=1,440.\n\n1,440 \u00f75040 = 0.2857. So 124.2857.\n\nSo S=110 +124.2857=234.2857.\n\nSo approximately $234.29 per component.\n\nBut the options are in whole numbers. So 234.29 is not an option. The options are 226, 230,240, etc. So 230 is too low (we saw the profit would be $604,800), which is less than required. 240 gives higher profit than required.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I should check the profit if the selling price is $234.29. But since the options don't have that, the next possible is 240.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach.\n\nProfit per component is S - 110. Because for each component, the profit is (selling price - cost).\n\nTotal profit per year is 420 *12 * (S-110) =5040*(S-110) >=626,400.\n\nSo 5040*(S-110) >=626,400.\n\nDivide both sides by 5040:\n\n(S -110) >=626,400/5040.\n\nCompute 626400 \u00f75040.\n\nWell, 5040 *120=604,800. 626,400-604,800=21,600.\n\nSo 5040*4=20,160. So 5040*124=5040*(120+4)=604,800+20,160=624,960.\n\n626,400-624,960=1,440. So 5040 * x =1,440. x=1,440/5040=0.2857.\n\nSo 124.2857.\n\nSo S=110 +124.2857=234.2857.\n\nSo the minimum S is $234.29 per component.\n\nBut since the options are in whole numbers, and 234.29 isn't an option, the next higher option is 240. So option C is 240.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check if 234.29 is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 626,400 \u00f75040.\n\nWait, 5040 is 504*10. So 504*10=5040.\n\nCompute 626400 \u00f75040.\n\nAlternatively, 626400 \u00f75040 = (626400 \u00f7 504) \u00f710.\n\nCompute 626400 \u00f7504.\n\nWell, 504 \u00d7 1240 = 504 \u00d71200=604,800; 504 \u00d740=20,160 \u2192 604,800 +20,160=624,960. So 504 \u00d71240=624,960.\n\n626400 -624,960=1,440. So 504 \u00d7 x=1,440. x=1,440/504= (1440 \u00f7 72)=20; 504 \u00f772=7. So 20/7 \u22482.857.\n\nSo 1240 +2.857\u22481242.857.\n\nWait, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nWait, 626400 \u00f75040.\n\nLet me compute 5040 \u00d7 124 = 624,960. 626,400 -624,960=1,440. So 5040 \u00d7 124.2857=626,400.\n\nWait, that's correct. So S must be 110 +124.2857=234.2857.\n\nSo the minimum S is 234.29, but the options don't have that, so the next higher is 240. So the answer is C)240.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let me calculate the required S.\n\nProfit per component is (S - 110). Total components per year 5040.\n\nSo 5040*(S -110) >=626,400.\n\nSo S -110 >=626400/5040=124.2857.\n\nSo S >=110 +124.2857=234.2857.\n\nSo the minimum S is $234.29.\n\nBut the options are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nSo 234.29 isn't an option, so the next possible is 240.\n\nThus, the correct answer is C)240.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out the minimum selling price per component that will ensure a yearly profit of at least $626,400. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the company produces 420 units every month. So, over a year, that's 12 months, right? Let me calculate the total number of units produced annually. 420 units/month * 12 months = 5040 units per year.\n\nEach component costs them $110 to produce. So, the total production cost per year is 5040 units * $110. Hmm, let me do that math. 5040 * 110... Well, 5000 * 110 is 550,000. 40 * 110 is 4,400. So total is 550,000 + 4,400 = $554,400.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the company sells all components each month, so each month's profit is revenue minus production cost for that month. Oh wait, but the question is about yearly profit. So maybe I should compute the total revenue minus total production cost over the year.\n\nRight, so the profit is total revenue minus total cost. They want this profit to be at least $626,400.\n\nLet me denote the selling price per component as S. Then, the revenue per month is 420 * S. So, the annual revenue would be 420*S*12.\n\nThe total production cost is 420 units/month * $110/month * 12 months? No, wait. Wait, no. Each month, they produce 420 units, each costing $110. So each month's cost is 420 * 110. So over 12 months, that's 420*110*12.\n\nSo total cost is 420 * 110 *12. Let me calculate that. 420*110 is 46,200. Multiply by 12: 46,200 *12 = 554,400. Yep, same as before.\n\nSo profit is (420 * S * 12) - (420 * 110 *12) >= 626,400.\n\nWait, but wait. Alternatively, since profit per month is (420*S - 420*110), and over 12 months, it's 12*(420*(S-110)) >= 626400.\n\nSo maybe it's easier to compute per month and then multiply by 12. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute the required equation.\n\nTotal revenue: 420 * S * 12.\n\nTotal cost: 420 * 110 *12.\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost = (420*12)*(S - 110) >= 626,400.\n\nSo 420*12 is 5040. So 5040*(S -110) >= 626,400.\n\nI can write this as:\n\n5040*(S - 110) >= 626400\n\nDivide both sides by 5040:\n\nS - 110 >= 626400 / 5040\n\nLet me compute 626400 divided by 5040. Hmm.\n\nWell, 5040 is 504*10. 504*10 = 5040.\n\nWhat's 626400 divided by 5040? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, I can simplify the division.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: 62640 / 504.\n\nLet me see, 504 goes into 62640 how many times?\n\n504 * 124 = ?\n\nWait, 504 * 120 = 60,480. 504 *4 =2016. So 504*124=60,480 + 2016= 62,496. Wait, 62,496 is less than 62,640. So 62,640 -62,496=144.\n\nSo 504*124=62,496. Then, 144 left. 504 goes into 144 about 0.2857 times. So 124.2857.\n\nWait, but 504 *124.2857=62,640?\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach. Let me compute 626400 divided by 5040.\n\nWait, 5040 * 124 = 5040*100=504000, 5040*24=120,960. So 504000 + 120,960=624,960.\n\n626,400 -624,960=1,440.\n\nSo 5040 * x =1,440.\n\nx=1,440 /5040 = 144/504 = 12/42= 2/7 \u22480.2857.\n\nSo 124 + 0.2857 \u2248124.2857.\n\nSo S -110 >= 124.2857.\n\nSo S >= 110 + 124.2857 \u2248 234.2857.\n\nSo S must be at least approximately $234.29.\n\nBut the options are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nWait, the options don't have 234. So the next higher option is 240. So the minimum price per component is $240.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute 626400 /5040 more accurately.\n\nLet me do it step by step.\n\nCompute 5040 into 626400.\n\n5040 * 124 = 624,960. Subtract that from 626,400: 626,400 -624,960 = 1,440.\n\nSo 5040 * x = 1,440. So x =1,440 /5040 = (1,440 \u00f7 1440)/(5040 \u00f71440) \u2192 wait no. Let me compute 1440 \u00f7 5040.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 720: 2 /7. So 2/7 is approximately 0.2857.\n\nSo 124 + 2/7 \u2248 124.2857.\n\nSo S must be >= 110 + 124.2857 \u2248234.2857.\n\nSo the minimum price per component is $234.29. But the options are in whole dollars. So the next higher option is $240.\n\nLooking at the options, C is 240, which would give a profit higher than required.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me compute the profit if S is 240.\n\nCompute annual revenue: 420 *240 *12.\n\nWait, 420 *240 = 100,800. Multiply by 12: 1,209,600.\n\nTotal cost: 420 *110 *12. 420*110=46,200. 46,200 *12=554,400.\n\nProfit: 1,209,600 -554,400 =655,200.\n\nWhich is more than 626,400. So that's acceptable.\n\nWhat about 230?\n\nCompute revenue:420 *230=96,600. *12= 1,159,200.\n\nCost:554,400.\n\nProfit:1,159,200 -554,400 =604,800. Which is less than 626,400. So 230 is not enough.\n\nWhat about 234.29? Let me compute.\n\nAt S=234.29:\n\nRevenue per month:420 *234.29= let's compute 420 *234 =98,  420 *234 = 98,280. 420 *0.29 =121.8. So total 98,280 +121.8=98,401.8 per month.\n\nAnnual revenue:98,401.8 *12=1,180,821.6.\n\nWait, wait, but that's not right because 234.29 is approximately 234.29, so maybe better to compute accurately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me recompute 626,400 /5040.\n\nWait, 5040 *124=624,960. 626,400-624,960=1,440.\n\n1,440 \u00f75040 = 0.2857. So 124.2857.\n\nSo S=110 +124.2857=234.2857.\n\nSo approximately $234.29 per component.\n\nBut the options are in whole numbers. So 234.29 is not an option. The options are 226, 230,240, etc. So 230 is too low (we saw the profit would be $604,800), which is less than required. 240 gives higher profit than required.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I should check the profit if the selling price is $234.29. But since the options don't have that, the next possible is 240.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach.\n\nProfit per component is S - 110. Because for each component, the profit is (selling price - cost).\n\nTotal profit per year is 420 *12 * (S-110) =5040*(S-110) >=626,400.\n\nSo 5040*(S-110) >=626,400.\n\nDivide both sides by 5040:\n\n(S -110) >=626,400/5040.\n\nCompute 626400 \u00f75040.\n\nWell, 5040 *120=604,800. 626,400-604,800=21,600.\n\nSo 5040*4=20,160. So 5040*124=5040*(120+4)=604,800+20,160=624,960.\n\n626,400-624,960=1,440. So 5040 * x =1,440. x=1,440/5040=0.2857.\n\nSo 124.2857.\n\nSo S=110 +124.2857=234.2857.\n\nSo the minimum S is $234.29 per component.\n\nBut since the options are in whole numbers, and 234.29 isn't an option, the next higher option is 240. So option C is 240.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check if 234.29 is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 626,400 \u00f75040.\n\nWait, 5040 is 504*10. So 504*10=5040.\n\nCompute 626400 \u00f75040.\n\nAlternatively, 626400 \u00f75040 = (626400 \u00f7 504) \u00f710.\n\nCompute 626400 \u00f7504.\n\nWell, 504 \u00d7 1240 = 504 \u00d71200=604,800; 504 \u00d740=20,160 \u2192 604,800 +20,160=624,960. So 504 \u00d71240=624,960.\n\n626400 -624,960=1,440. So 504 \u00d7 x=1,440. x=1,440/504= (1440 \u00f7 72)=20; 504 \u00f772=7. So 20/7 \u22482.857.\n\nSo 1240 +2.857\u22481242.857.\n\nWait, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nWait, 626400 \u00f75040.\n\nLet me compute 5040 \u00d7 124 = 624,960. 626,400 -624,960=1,440. So 5040 \u00d7 124.2857=626,400.\n\nWait, that's correct. So S must be 110 +124.2857=234.2857.\n\nSo the minimum S is 234.29, but the options don't have that, so the next higher is 240. So the answer is C)240.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let me calculate the required S.\n\nProfit per component is (S - 110). Total components per year 5040.\n\nSo 5040*(S -110) >=626,400.\n\nSo S -110 >=626400/5040=124.2857.\n\nSo S >=110 +124.2857=234.2857.\n\nSo the minimum S is $234.29.\n\nBut the options are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nSo 234.29 isn't an option, so the next possible is 240.\n\nThus, the correct answer is C)240.\n\n\nTo determine the minimum selling price per component that guarantees a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we start by calculating the total production and revenue.\n\n1. **Total Units Produced Annually**:  \n   The company produces 420 units per month.
