      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about figuring out the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars. Hmm, let's see. The question gives me two different purchasing options with their total costs, and I need to find the individual prices of a soda and an energy bar first, right?\n\nAlright, the first option says I can buy one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents. So if I let S be the cost of a soda and E be the cost of an energy bar, then the equation would be S + 2E = 150. Got that down.\n\nThe second option is two sodas and three energy bars for 300 cents. So that would be 2S + 3E = 300. Okay, now I have a system of two equations with two variables. I should be able to solve this using substitution or elimination. Let me think which method would be easier here.\n\nHmm, elimination might work. Let me try that. If I take the first equation, S + 2E = 150, I can maybe manipulate it to eliminate one of the variables. Let's see, if I multiply the entire first equation by 2, then I get 2S + 4E = 300. Now I have:\n\nEquation 1: 2S + 4E = 300\nEquation 2: 2S + 3E = 300\n\nWait, no. Wait, the second equation is 2S + 3E = 300. So now I can subtract equation 2 from the modified equation 1 to eliminate S. Let me write that out.\n\n(2S +4E) - (2S +3E) = 300 - 300\nSimplify that: 2S - 2S +4E -3E = 0\nSo that becomes E = 0. Wait, that can't be right. If E is zero, then the energy bars are free? That doesn't make sense. Oh wait, did I do the subtraction correctly? Let me check.\n\nWait, I think I might have mixed up the equations. Because when I multiplied the first equation by 2, I got 2S +4E=300. The second equation is 2S +3E=300. So when I subtract equation 2 from equation 1, it's (2S +4E) - (2S +3E) = 300 - 300. So that's 0S +1E = 0. So E=0. Hmm, that's strange because if E is zero, then the first equation would be S +0 =150, so S=150. But then in the second equation, 2*150 +3*0=300, which is correct. So according to this, energy bars are free and a soda costs 150 cents. But that seems odd because why would they give energy bars for free? But perhaps the problem allows for that possibility. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equations. Let me double-check the problem statement. The first option is one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents. Second is two sodas and three energy bars for 300. So equations are correct.\n\nWait, but if E=0, then the first option would cost S=150, second option 2S=300, so 2*150=300. So that's correct. So E is zero. So each energy bar is 0 cents? That's a bit strange, but mathematically, that's what the equations are leading to. So then, the cost of a soda is 150 cents, energy bar is free.\n\nWait, but then the question asks for six sodas and seven bars. So 6*150 +7*0 = 900 +0=900. So the answer would be E)900. But looking at the options, E is 900. So that's the choice. But wait, that seems a bit counterintuitive because usually, the prices would be positive. Did I do something wrong?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me try substitution instead. Let's take the first equation: S = 150 - 2E. Substitute that into the second equation. So 2*(150 -2E) +3E=300. Let's compute that.\n\n2*150 is 300, 2*(-2E) is -4E. So 300 -4E +3E=300. Combine like terms: 300 -E =300. Subtract 300 from both sides: -E=0. So E=0. Same result as before. So it's correct. So each energy bar is 0 cents, soda is 150.\n\nSo then, six sodas would be 6*150=900. Seven bars would be 7*0=0. So total is 900. So the answer is E)900.\n\nWait, but the options don't have E as 900. Let me check the options again. Oh wait, the options are A)500, B)600, C)750, D)800, E)900. So E is 900. So that's the correct choice.\n\nBut wait, this seems odd because why would someone sell energy bars for free? Maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me try another approach. Perhaps I swapped the equations. Let me think: perhaps the first option is 150 cents, second is 300 cents, but maybe the second option is more expensive because it's more items. Let me see.\n\nFirst option: 1 S + 2 E = 150.\n\nSecond option: 2 S +3 E=300.\n\nIf I solve this system, I get E=0, S=150. So that's correct. So the problem as stated leads to E=0. So that's the only conclusion.\n",

Because equation 2 is 2S +3E=300, and the new equation 1 is 2S +4E=300. So subtract equation 2 from this new equation.\n\nSo, subtracting equation 2 from equation 1 (after multiplying):\n\n(2S +4E) - (2S +3E) = 300 - 300.\n\nThat gives (0S) + E = 0. So E =0?
