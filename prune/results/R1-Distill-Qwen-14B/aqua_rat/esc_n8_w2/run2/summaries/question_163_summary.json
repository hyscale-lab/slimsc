      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says, \"A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" The options are A)58.3%, B)62.5%, C)63.5%, D)64.5%, E)65.5%. Hmm, I think I can handle this, but I need to take it step by step.\n\nAlright, so first, let's break down what's given. The man currently spends 70% of his income. That means his expenditure is 70%, and his savings or whatever he doesn't spend is 30%. Now, his income is going to increase by 20%. I need to find out what his new expenditure percentage will be after this increase.\n\nWait, wait. Wait a second. So, the key here is whether his expenditure increases in the same way as his income or if it's based on a fixed amount. Hmm. Because if his income goes up by 20%, but he still spends 70% of it, his absolute expenditure would go up. But the question is about the percentage of his new income that he spends. Oh, I see. Because the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income, not the same as before.\n\nSo, let me think with numbers. Maybe using a hypothetical income to make it concrete. Let's say his original income is $100. Then, he spends 70% of that, which is $70. Now, his income increases by 20%. So 20% of 100 is 20, so his new income is 120.\n\nNow, if his expenditure increases by the same percentage as his income, wait, no. Because the question doesn't say his spending increases by 20%. It says his income increases by 20%, and we need to find his new expenditure as a percentage of this new income. So, wait, maybe his spending remains the same in absolute terms, or does it? No, the question doesn't specify that his spending increases or decreases. Oh wait, no, the problem states that he spends 70% of his income. So, his spending is always 70% of whatever his income is. So, if his income goes up, his spending also goes up by 70% of the new income.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Let me think again. Wait, no. The question is phrased as if he continues to spend 70% of his income after the increase. Or is he just increasing his income by 20%, but keeping his spending the same as before? No, the question says he spends 70% of his income, so if his income changes, his spending changes proportionally.\n\nWait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me structure this:\n\nOriginal Income (I1) = Let's assume I1 = 100 (for easy calculation)\nOriginal Expenditure (E1) = 70% of I1 = 0.7 * 100 = 70\n\nNow, income increases by 20%, so new income I2 = I1 + 20% of I1 = 100 + 20 = 120.\n\nIf he continues to spend the same proportion, which is 70%, then new expenditure E2 = 70% of I2 = 0.7 * 120 = 84.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. The question is about his new expenditure as a percentage of his new income. So E2 is 84, and I2 is 120. So the percentage is (84 / 120) * 100%.\n\nCalculating that: 84 divided by 120. Hmm, 120 goes into 84 zero times, so 0.7, because 120 * 0.7 = 84. So 0.7 is 70%. Wait, that can't be right because that's the same percentage. But that's not one of the options. The options don't have 70%. So, I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, maybe I got the question wrong. Let me read it again. \"A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" Wait, perhaps the question is about whether his expenditure (in absolute terms) increases, but the question is about the percentage of his new income he spends. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about his expenditure remaining the same, but as a percentage of his new income.\n\nWait, no, the original statement says he spends 70% of his income. So if his income increases, his spending would also increase proportionally, right? So, for example, if he makes more, he spends more, but the percentage remains the same. So in that case, his new expenditure percentage would still be 70%, but that's not an option here. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the man's income increases, but his spending doesn't increase as much. No, the question doesn't say that. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming that his spending is tied to his income. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the question is implying that his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure doesn't change in absolute terms. So, for example, he was spending $70 when his income was $100. Now his income is $120, but he still spends $70. So the new expenditure as a percentage would be 70/120 = 58.333...%, which is option A. But that seems unlikely because the problem says he continues to spend 70% of his income. So perhaps that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that he's spending 70% of his income, and then his income increases, so his spending also increases proportionally. So, for example, if his income goes up by 20%, his spending would go up by 20% as well. So, 70% plus 20% would be 90%, but that can't be right because that's not how percentages work. Alternatively, the increase in spending is 20% of the original spending. So, 70 plus 20% of 70 is 70 + 14 = 84. Then the new income is 120, so 84/120 is 70% again. But that's not matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. Let's denote his original income as I. He spends 70% of I, so his expenditure is 0.7I. His income increases by 20%, so new income is I + 0.2I = 1.2I. If his spending remains the same as a percentage of his income, then his new expenditure is 0.7 * 1.2I = 0.84I. So the new percentage is (0.84I / 1.2I) * 100% = (0.84 / 1.2) * 100% = 70%. But again, 70% isn't an option, so that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Maybe he spends 70% of his income, but after his income increases, his expenditure doesn't change. So his absolute expenditure remains the same, but the percentage changes. Let's model that.\n\nOriginal Income: I\nExpenditure: 0.7I\nNew Income: I + 0.2I = 1.2I\nNew Expenditure: 0.7I (same as before)\nSo the new expenditure as a percentage is (0.7I / 1.2I) * 100% = (0.7 / 1.2) * 100% = 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nBut that would imply that the man is spending a lower percentage of his income, which seems counterintuitive because his income has increased but his spending hasn't. But the problem doesn't state whether his spending is fixed or if it's a fixed proportion. Hmm. The problem says, \"If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Does it mean that his spending remains the same (so the percentage decreases), or does it mean that he continues to spend 70% of his new income?\n\nWait, the problem says, \"A man spends 70% of his income.\" That implies that his spending is always 70% of his current income. So if his income increases, his spending should also increase. So, in that case, the new expenditure percentage is still 70%, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is that his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure doesn't change. So, for example, his original income is 100, spends 70. Now income is 120, but he still spends 70. So the percentage is 70/120 = 58.333%, which is option A. But why would his spending not change? The problem doesn't specify that, but perhaps that's the intended interpretation.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"spends 70% of his income.\" So if his income increases, then his spending must also increase as a percentage of the new income. So his new expenditure percentage is 70% of 120, which is 84, so 84/120 is 70%, which again isn't an option. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure only increases by 10%. Wait, but the problem doesn't say that. Hmm. Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nThe question: \"A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" So, perhaps the problem is that his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure is based on the original income. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that his income increases, but his expenditure as a percentage of income decreases.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach it mathematically without plugging in numbers. Let the original income be I. He spends 70% of I, so 0.7I. Now, his income increases by 20%, so new income is 1.2I. The problem is, what is his new expenditure as a percentage of his new income.\n\nIf he continues to spend 70%, then new expenditure is 0.7 * 1.2I = 0.84I. So the percentage is (0.84I / 1.2I) * 100% = 70%. But that's not an option, so perhaps I'm not interpreting correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that he has a fixed expenditure, say, E. Then, his original income is I, so E = 0.7I. When his income increases to 1.2I, his new expenditure as a percentage would be E / 1.2I. But since E = 0.7I, that becomes (0.7I) / (1.2I) = 0.7 / 1.2 = 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nBut the problem says he spends 70% of his income, which suggests that his expenditure is a percentage, not a fixed amount. So in that case, his new expenditure would be 70% of the new income, which would be 70% of 120, which is 84. So 84 is 70% of 120. So his new expenditure is 70%, which isn't an option. But since the options don't have 70%, perhaps the intended approach is that his expenditure doesn't change, and so the percentage decreases.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the options again. The options are A)58.3%, B)62.5%, C)63.5%, D)64.5%, E)65.5%. So 58.3% is an option, which is exactly 70/120. So perhaps the intended answer is A)58.3%, under the assumption that his expenditure remains the same as a fixed amount, not a percentage. But the problem states that he spends 70% of his income, which suggests that it's a percentage, not a fixed amount. So I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming that the expenditure remains the same. Let me think again. The problem says, \"If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" So the way it's phrased, perhaps the man's expenditure increases by 20% as well. So, his original expenditure is 70, so new expenditure is 70 * 1.2 = 84. His new income is 120. So 84/120 is 70%, which is again not an option. So I'm back to square one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that his income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by a certain percentage, but the question is phrased differently. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure as a percentage of income increases by some amount. Wait, but the way it's written, I think the intended approach is that the man's income increases, and his spending as a percentage of his income decreases because he can afford more, but that's an assumption not stated in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the man's expenditure increasing by 20%, but that's not what's stated. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is a bit of a trick. Let's think about it again. The man spends 70% of his income. So his savings are 30%. If his income increases by 20%, what's his new expenditure percentage? Let's model this.\n\nLet me take I as original income, E as expenditure.\n\nE = 0.7I.\n\nNew income I' = I + 0.2I = 1.2I.\n\nIf the expenditure remains the same (E = 0.7I), then new expenditure percentage is (E / I') * 100% = (0.7I) / (1.2I) * 100% = (0.7/1.2)*100% \u2248 58.333%, which is option A.\n\nBut if the expenditure is based on the new income, then E' = 0.7 * I' = 0.7 * 1.2I = 0.84I, and the percentage is 70%, which isn't an option.\n\nSo perhaps the intended answer is option A, assuming that his absolute expenditure remains the same, and the percentage decreases. But the problem says he spends 70% of his income, which suggests that his spending is tied to his income, so his percentage should remain the same.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me think of it another way. Maybe the problem is that his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure also increases by 20% of the original income. So his original expenditure is 70 (if I is 100). Then, his new expenditure would be 70 + 20 = 90. His new income is 120, so 90/120 = 75%, which isn't an option either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the increase in income affects the percentage in a different way. Wait, maybe the problem is that his expenditure increases by 20%, but that's not what the question says. The question says his income increases by 20%, and asks for the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is that his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by 10% of the original income. So, original income 100, expenditure 70. New income 120, new expenditure 70 + 10 = 80. So 80/120 = 66.666%, which is not an option. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the increase in income affects the percentage, but I'm not seeing it. Let me try with variables.\n\nLet me let the original income be I.\n\nOriginal expenditure: 0.7I.\n\nNew income: I * 1.2.\n\nNew expenditure: Assuming he continues to spend 70%, then it's 0.7 * (1.2I) = 0.84I.\n\nSo the new expenditure as a percentage is (0.84I) / (1.2I) * 100% = 70%. But that's not an option.\n\nSo perhaps the question is that his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure remains the same as a fixed amount, so the percentage decreases. So 0.7I / 1.2I = 0.58333, so 58.333%, which is option A.\n\nBut that contradicts the initial statement that he spends 70% of his income. So I'm not sure why the problem is phrased this way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by a certain percentage, and the question is to find the new expenditure as a percentage of the original income. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in thinking that the percentage is calculated over the new income. The problem says, \"what will be his new expenditure?\" which is ambiguous. It could be referring to the absolute amount or the percentage. But the options are percentages, so it must be the percentage of his new income.\n\nSo, in that case, if his income increases by 20%, and he continues to spend 70%, then the percentage remains 70%, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended interpretation is that his expenditure is a fixed amount, not a percentage, which would make option A correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the question being that his income increases, and his expenditure increases by the same percentage, but that's not stated.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it again with another example.\n\nSuppose the man's income is $100. He spends 70%, which is $70. Now, his income increases by 20%, so new income is $120. If he continues to spend 70% of his income, then he now spends 70% of 120, which is 84. So his new expenditure is 84, which is 70% of his new income. But the options don't have 70%, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about his expenditure in absolute terms, not as a percentage. But the options are percentages, so that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is that his income increases by 20%, and his expenditure also increases by 20%, so new expenditure is 70 + 14 = 84, and new income is 120. So 84/120 = 70%, which again isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is phrased as \"what will be his new expenditure,\" meaning the amount, not the percentage. But the options are percentages, so that's unlikely.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the options. The options are A)58.3%, B)62.5%, C)63.5%, D)64.5%, E)65.5%. So 58.3% is exactly 70/120, which would be the case if his expenditure remains the same as a fixed amount when his income increases. But the problem says he spends 70% of his income, which suggests it's a percentage, not a fixed amount.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the problem as follows:\n\nLet the original income be I.\n\nOriginal expenditure: 0.7I.\n\nNew income: 1.2I.\n\nIf his expenditure is fixed at 0.7I, then new percentage is (0.7I)/(1.2I) = 0.7/1.2 = 58.333%.\n\nSo the answer would be A)58.3%.\n\nBut why would the expenditure be fixed? The problem says he spends 70% of his income, which suggests that his expenditure is a percentage, so it would also increase. So I'm confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick, and the answer is 70%, but that's not an option. So maybe I've made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the problem in terms of his expenditure remaining the same as a percentage of his new income. That is, if his income increases by 20%, and his expenditure as a percentage decreases to maintain the same absolute spending. But that's not what the problem states.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by a different percentage, leading to a new percentage. But the problem doesn't give that information.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it this way: if the income increases by 20%, the percentage of income spent would remain the same, so 70%, but that's not an option. So the only way the options make sense is if the expenditure is a fixed amount. So, perhaps the answer is A)58.3%.\n\nBut I'm not confident because the problem says he spends 70% of his income, which suggests that the percentage is maintained. So, I'm torn between whether the answer is 70% or 58.3%. But since 70% isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is A)58.3%.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think that the problem is not about the percentage of the new income but about the change in expenditure. Let me rephrase.\n\nOriginal income: 100.\n\nExpenditure: 70.\n\nNew income: 120.\n\nIf he continues to spend 70% of his income, new expenditure is 84.\n\nSo, the increase in expenditure is 14.\n\nBut the question is about the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income, which is 84/120 = 70%. So that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the change in expenditure as a percentage of the new income. No, the question just asks for the new expenditure.\n\nHmm. I'm going to have to go with the only option that makes sense under the assumption that the expenditure is a fixed amount, which is 58.3% (option A).\n",

But that's not matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. Let's denote his original income as I. He spends 70% of I, so his expenditure is 0.7I. His income increases by 20%, so new income is I + 0.2I = 1.2I. If his spending remains the same as a percentage of his income, then his new expenditure is 0.7 * 1.2I = 0.84I. So the new percentage is (0.84I / 1.2I) * 100% = (0.84 / 1.2) * 100% = 70%. But again, 70% isn't an option, so that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Maybe he spends 70% of his income, but after his income increases, his expenditure doesn't change. So his absolute expenditure remains the same, but the percentage changes. Let's model that.\n\nOriginal Income: I\nExpenditure: 0.7I\nNew Income: I + 0.2I = 1.2I\nNew Expenditure: 0.7I (same as before)\nSo the new expenditure as a percentage is (0.7I / 1.2I) * 100% = (0.7 / 1.2) * 100% = 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nBut that would imply that the man is spending a lower percentage of his income, which seems counterintuitive because his income has increased but his spending hasn't. But the problem doesn't state whether his spending is fixed or if it's a fixed proportion. Hmm. The problem says, \"If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Does it mean that his spending remains the same (so the percentage decreases), or does it mean that he continues to spend 70% of his new income?\n\nWait, the problem says, \"A man spends 70% of his income.\" That implies that his spending is always 70% of his current income. So if his income increases, his spending should also increase. So, in that case, the new expenditure percentage is still 70%, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is that his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure doesn't change. So, for example, his original income is 100, spends 70. Now income is 120, but he still spends 70. So the percentage is 70/120 = 58.333%, which is option A. But why would his spending not change? The problem doesn't specify that, but perhaps that's the intended interpretation.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"spends 70% of his income.\" So if his income increases, then his spending must also increase as a percentage of the new income. So his new expenditure percentage is 70% of 120, which is 84, so 84/120 is 70%, which again isn't an option. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure only increases by 10%. Wait, but the problem doesn't say that. Hmm. Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nThe question: \"A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" So, perhaps the problem is that his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure is based on the original income. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that his income increases, but his expenditure as a percentage of income decreases.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach it mathematically without plugging in numbers. Let the original income be I. He spends 70% of I, so 0.7I. Now, his income increases by 20%, so new income is 1.2I. The problem is, what is his new expenditure as a percentage of his new income.\n\nIf he continues to spend 70%, then new expenditure is 0.7 * 1.2I = 0.84I. So the percentage is (0.84I / 1.2I) * 100% = 70%. But that's not an option, so perhaps I'm not interpreting correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that he has a fixed expenditure, say, E. Then, his original income is I, so E = 0.7I. When his income increases to 1.2I, his new expenditure as a percentage would be E / 1.2I. But since E = 0.7I, that becomes (0.7I) / (1.2I) = 0.7 / 1.2 = 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nBut the problem says he spends 70% of his income, which suggests that his expenditure is a percentage, not a fixed amount. So in that case, his new expenditure would be 70% of the new income, which would be 70% of 120, which is 84. So 84 is 70% of 120. So his new expenditure is 70%, which isn't an option. But since the options don't have 70%, perhaps the intended approach is that his expenditure doesn't change, and so the percentage decreases.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the options again. The options are A)58.3%, B)62.5%, C)63.5%, D)64.5%, E)65.5%. So 58.3% is an option, which is exactly 70/120. So perhaps the intended answer is A)58.3%, under the assumption that his expenditure remains the same as a fixed amount, not a percentage. But the problem states that he spends 70% of his income, which suggests that it's a percentage, not a fixed amount. So I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming that the expenditure remains the same. Let me think again. The problem says, \"If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" So the way it's phrased, perhaps the man's expenditure increases by 20% as well. So, his original expenditure is 70, so new expenditure is 70 * 1.2 = 84. His new income is 120. So 84/120 is 70%, which is again not an option. So I'm back to square one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that his income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by a certain percentage, but the question is phrased differently. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure as a percentage of income increases by some amount. Wait, but the way it's written, I think the intended approach is that the man's income increases, and his spending as a percentage of his income decreases because he can afford more, but that's an assumption not stated in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the man's expenditure increasing by 20%, but that's not what's stated. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is a bit of a trick. Let's think about it again. The man spends 70% of his income. So his savings are 30%. If his income increases by 20%, what's his new expenditure percentage? Let's model this.\n\nLet me take I as original income, E as expenditure.\n\nE = 0.7I.\n\nNew income I' = I + 0.2I = 1.2I.\n\nIf the expenditure remains the same (E = 0.7I), then new expenditure percentage is (E / I') * 100% = (0.7I) / (1.2I) * 100% = (0.7/1.2)*100% \u2248 58.333%, which is option A.\n\nBut if the expenditure is based on the new income, then E' = 0.7 * I' = 0.7 * 1.2I = 0.84I, and the percentage is 70%, which isn't an option.\n\nSo perhaps the intended answer is option A, assuming that his absolute expenditure remains the same, and the percentage decreases. But the problem says he spends 70% of his income, which suggests that his spending is tied to his income, so his percentage should remain the same.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me think of it another way. Maybe the problem is that his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure also increases by 20% of the original income. So his original expenditure is 70 (if I is 100). Then, his new expenditure would be 70 + 20 = 90. His new income is 120, so 90/120 = 75%, which isn't an option either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the increase in income affects the percentage in a different way. Wait, maybe the problem is that his expenditure increases by 20%, but that's not what the question says. The question says his income increases by 20%, and asks for the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is that his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by 10% of the original income. So, original income 100, expenditure 70. New income 120, new expenditure 70 + 10 = 80. So 80/120 = 66.666%, which is not an option. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the increase in income affects the percentage, but I'm not seeing it. Let me try with variables.\n\nLet me let the original income be I.\n\nOriginal expenditure: 0.7I.\n\nNew income: I * 1.2.\n\nNew expenditure: Assuming he continues to spend 70%, then it's 0.7 * (1.2I) = 0.84I.\n\nSo the new expenditure as a percentage is (0.84I) / (1.2I) * 100% = 70%. But that's not an option.\n\nSo perhaps the question is that his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure remains the same as a fixed amount, so the percentage decreases. So 0.7I / 1.2I = 0.58333, so 58.333%, which is option A.\n\nBut that contradicts the initial statement that he spends 70% of his income. So I'm not sure why the problem is phrased this way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by a certain percentage, and the question is to find the new expenditure as a percentage of the original income. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in thinking that the percentage is calculated over the new income. The problem says, \"what will be his new expenditure?\" which is ambiguous. It could be referring to the absolute amount or the percentage. But the options are percentages, so it must be the percentage of his new income.\n\nSo, in that case, if his income increases by 20%, and he continues to spend 70%, then the percentage remains 70%, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended interpretation is that his expenditure is a fixed amount, not a percentage, which would make option A correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the question being that his income increases, and his expenditure increases by the same percentage, but that's not stated.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it again with another example.\n\nSuppose the man's income is $100. He spends 70%, which is $70. Now, his income increases by 20%, so new income is $120. If he continues to spend 70% of his income, then he now spends 70% of 120, which is 84. So his new expenditure is 84, which is 70% of his new income. But the options don't have 70%, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about his expenditure in absolute terms, not as a percentage. But the options are percentages, so that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is that his income increases by 20%, and his expenditure also increases by 20%, so new expenditure is 70 + 14 = 84, and new income is 120. So 84/120 = 70%, which again isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is phrased as \"what will be his new expenditure,\" meaning the amount, not the percentage. But the options are percentages, so that's unlikely.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the options. The options are A)58.3%, B)62.5%, C)63.5%, D)64.5%, E)65.5%. So 58.3% is exactly 70/120, which would be the case if his expenditure remains the same as a fixed amount when his income increases. But the problem says he spends 70% of his income, which suggests it's a percentage, not a fixed amount.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the problem as follows:\n\nLet the original income be I.\n\nOriginal expenditure: 0.7I.\n\nNew income: 1.2I.\n\nIf his expenditure is fixed at 0.7I, then new percentage is (0.7I)/(1.2I) = 0.7/1.2 = 58.333%.\n\nSo the answer would be A)58.3%.\n\nBut why would the expenditure be fixed? The problem says he spends 70% of his income, which suggests that his expenditure is a percentage, so it would also increase. So I'm confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick, and the answer is 70%, but that's not an option. So maybe I've made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the problem in terms of his expenditure remaining the same as a percentage of his new income. That is, if his income increases by 20%, and his expenditure as a percentage decreases to maintain the same absolute spending. But that's not what the problem states.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by a different percentage, leading to a new percentage. But the problem doesn't give that information.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it this way: if the income increases by 20%, the percentage of income spent would remain the same, so 70%, but that's not an option. So the only way the options make sense is if the expenditure is a fixed amount. So, perhaps the answer is A)58.3%.\n\nBut I'm not confident because the problem says he spends 70% of his income, which suggests that the percentage is maintained. So, I'm torn between whether the answer is 70% or 58.3%. But since 70% isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is A)58.3%.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think that the problem is not about the percentage of the new income but about the change in expenditure. Let me rephrase.\n\nOriginal income: 100.\n\nExpenditure: 70.\n\nNew income: 120.\n\nIf he continues to spend 70% of his income, new expenditure is 84.\n\nSo, the increase in expenditure is 14.\n\nBut the question is about the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income, which is 84/120 = 70%. So that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the change in expenditure as a percentage of the new income. No, the question just asks for the new expenditure.\n\nHmm. I'm going to have to go with the only option that makes sense under the assumption that the expenditure is a fixed amount, which is 58.3% (option A).\n\n\nThe problem states that a man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, we need to determine his new expenditure as a percentage of his new income.\n\n1. **Original Income and Expenditure**:  \n   Let the original income be \\( I \\). The man spends 70% of his income, so his expenditure is \\( 0.7I \\).\n\n2. **New Income**:  \n   After a 20% increase, the new income becomes \\( I + 0.2I = 1.2I \\).\n\n3. **Interpretation of Expenditure**:  \n   The problem does not explicitly state whether the expenditure remains fixed or continues to be 70% of the new income.  \n   - If the expenditure remains fixed at \\( 0.7I \\), the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income is:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{New Expenditure Percentage} = \\frac{0.7I}{1.2I} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{0.7}{1.2} \\times 100\\% = 58.333\\%\n     \\]\n   - If the expenditure continues to be 70% of the new income, the new expenditure would be \\( 0.7 \\times 1.2I = 0.84I \\), and the percentage would remain \\( 70\\% \\). However, \\( 70\\% \\) is not one of the options.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:  \n   Since the options provided do not include \\( 70\\% \\), the intended interpretation likely assumes that the expenditure remains fixed at \\( 0.7I \\), and the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income is \\( 58.333\\% \\), which corresponds to option **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says a man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, what will be his new expenditure percentage?\n\nWait, so initially, he's spending 70% of his income. That means he's saving the remaining 30%, right? But the question is about his expenditure after his income goes up by 20%. Oh wait, but does his expenditure increase proportionally? Or does he change his spending habits? The question doesn't say anything about him changing how much he spends, just that his income goes up. So I think his spending remains the same in absolute terms, but as a percentage of his new income, it would be different.\n\nLet me think. Let's say his original income is, I don't know, maybe $100. That makes percentages easy to calculate. So if his income is $100, he spends 70% of that, which is $70. Now his income increases by 20%, so 20% of 100 is 20, so his new income is $120.\n\nWait, but does his spending increase by the same 20%? Or does he keep spending the same amount? The problem says he \"spends 70% of his income.\" So if his income goes up, his spending is 70% of the new income. Wait, no, maybe I misunderstood. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question says, \"If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" So I think the way to interpret this is: his spending is still the same as a portion of his income. Wait, no, maybe not. Because if his income increases, but he continues to spend the same percentage, his absolute spending would change. But the question is about the new expenditure as a percentage of his new income.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's model it with variables.\n\nLet\u2019s denote his original income as I. He spends 70% of I, so expenditure E = 0.7 * I.\n\nHis income increases by 20%, so the new income I' = I + 0.2I = 1.2I.\n\nAssuming that his expenditure increases by the same proportion as his income, or does it? Wait, the question says he spends 70% of his income. So when his income changes, his spending rate is still 70%? Or does his expenditure remain the same in absolute terms, but as a percentage of the new income, it's lower?\n\nWait, perhaps I've misread the question. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says, \"A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" Hmm, so the wording is a bit ambiguous. Does it mean that his expenditure increases by 20% as well, or does he continue to spend 70% of his new income?\n\nWait, perhaps it's the latter. Let me rephrase. If his income increases by 20%, and he continues to spend the same proportion, then his expenditure as a percentage of income would still be 70%. But wait, that can't be right because the answer options don't include 70%. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the question is implying that his expenditure remains the same in absolute terms, and we have to find what percentage that is of his new income.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Let me think again.\n\nOriginal income: I.\n\nExpenditure: 0.7I.\n\nIncome increases by 20% \u2192 new income = I + 0.2I = 1.2I.\n\nIf his expenditure remains the same, which is 0.7I, then the new expenditure as a percentage of new income is (0.7I) / (1.2I). The I cancels out, so it's 0.7 / 1.2.\n\nCalculating that: 0.7 divided by 1.2 is equal to 7/12. Let me compute that. 7 divided by 12 is approximately 0.583333... which is 58.333...%.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 58.3%, which matches this. So the answer would be A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the question correctly. The problem says he spends 70% of his income. So if his income goes up, his spending is a function of that. But the way the question is phrased, if the income increases, does his spending increase proportionally, or does he keep the same absolute spending?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is saying that his spending is fixed, but his income goes up. So his spending as a percentage of income would decrease.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is saying that his spending rate is fixed at 70%, regardless of income. But that doesn't make much sense because the percentage would stay the same.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think of it as:\n\nHe spends 70% of his income. So if his income increases, his spending also increases by 70% of the new income. So the percentage remains the same, 70%.\n\nBut in that case, the answer would be 70%, which is not among the options. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, so perhaps I was correct the first time. That is, his expenditure is fixed in absolute terms, so as a percentage of the new income, it's lower.\n\nSo let's recast the problem.\n\nOriginal income: I.\n\nExpenditure: 0.7I.\n\nAfter income increases by 20%, new income is 1.2I.\n\nIf his expenditure remains 0.7I, then the new percentage is (0.7I)/(1.2I) = 0.7/1.2 = 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nSo that makes sense. Therefore, the correct answer is A) 58.3%.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says he spends 70% of his income. So when his income increases, perhaps his spending also increases by 70% of the new income, meaning that his spending as a percentage remains 70%. But that would mean his expenditure is 70% of the new income, which is 0.7*1.2I = 0.84I. But that's the absolute amount, not the percentage.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for his new expenditure as a percentage. So if he continues to spend 70%, then his percentage would be 70% of the new income, so 70% as before. But that doesn't match any options except if the options don't have 70%, which they don't.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Maybe when his income increases, his expenditure also increases by 20%, meaning his absolute spending goes up by 20%, and then we compute the new percentage.\n\nBut that would mean:\n\nOriginal expenditure: 0.7I.\n\nAfter 20% increase, new expenditure is 0.7I * 1.2 = 0.84I.\n\nNew income is 1.2I.\n\nSo the new percentage is (0.84I)/(1.2I) = 0.7 \u2192 70%, which again isn't an option.\n\nHmm, so that's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe question says: \"A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\"\n\nThe key is whether the expenditure is fixed in absolute terms or in percentage terms.\n\nIf the problem states that he continues to spend 70% of his income, then his expenditure as a percentage remains 70%. But since the options don't have that, I must have misread something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is saying that his expenditure is fixed in absolute terms, so when his income increases, the percentage of income spent decreases.\n\nSo let's model that.\n\nOriginal income: I.\n\nExpenditure: 0.7I.\n\nAfter income increases by 20%, new income is 1.2I.\n\nExpenditure remains 0.7I.\n\nSo new percentage is (0.7I) / (1.2I) = 0.7/1.2 = 0.583333..., which is 58.333...%, so option A.\n\nBut then why is the question phrased as \"spends 70% of his income\"? That would imply that regardless of income, he's spending 70% of it. So perhaps the confusion is between absolute spending and percentage.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think that his spending is a fixed amount, not a percentage. So if he used to spend 70% of his income, which is 0.7I, and his income increases by 20%, his spending remains 0.7I. So as a percentage of the new income, it's 0.7I / 1.2I = 58.3%.\n\nSo that leads me to option A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that his expenditure is fixed as 70% of his income, which would mean that if his income increases, his spending also increases proportionally. But that would mean his spending as a percentage remains 70%, which isn't an option.\n\nSo perhaps the correct interpretation is that his absolute expenditure remains the same, and we need to find the new percentage.\n\nThus, the answer is A)58.3%.\n",

If his income increases by 20%, and he continues to spend the same proportion, then his expenditure as a percentage of income would still be 70%. But wait, that can't be right because the answer options don't include 70%. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the question is implying that his expenditure remains the same in absolute terms, and we have to find what percentage that is of his new income.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Let me think again.\n\nOriginal income: I.\n\nExpenditure: 0.7I.\n\nIncome increases by 20% \u2192 new income = I + 0.2I = 1.2I.\n\nIf his expenditure remains the same, which is 0.7I, then the new expenditure as a percentage of new income is (0.7I) / (1.2I). The I cancels out, so it's 0.7 / 1.2.\n\nCalculating that: 0.7 divided by 1.2 is equal to 7/12. Let me compute that. 7 divided by 12 is approximately 0.583333... which is 58.333...%.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 58.3%, which matches this. So the answer would be A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the question correctly. The problem says he spends 70% of his income. So if his income goes up, his spending is a function of that. But the way the question is phrased, if the income increases, does his spending increase proportionally, or does he keep the same absolute spending?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is saying that his spending is fixed, but his income goes up. So his spending as a percentage of income would decrease.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is saying that his spending rate is fixed at 70%, regardless of income. But that doesn't make much sense because the percentage would stay the same.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think of it as:\n\nHe spends 70% of his income. So if his income increases, his spending also increases by 70% of the new income. So the percentage remains the same, 70%.\n\nBut in that case, the answer would be 70%, which is not among the options. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, so perhaps I was correct the first time. That is, his expenditure is fixed in absolute terms, so as a percentage of the new income, it's lower.\n\nSo let's recast the problem.\n\nOriginal income: I.\n\nExpenditure: 0.7I.\n\nAfter income increases by 20%, new income is 1.2I.\n\nIf his expenditure remains 0.7I, then the new percentage is (0.7I)/(1.2I) = 0.7/1.2 = 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nSo that makes sense. Therefore, the correct answer is A) 58.3%.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says he spends 70% of his income. So when his income increases, perhaps his spending also increases by 70% of the new income, meaning that his spending as a percentage remains 70%. But that would mean his expenditure is 70% of the new income, which is 0.7*1.2I = 0.84I. But that's the absolute amount, not the percentage.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for his new expenditure as a percentage. So if he continues to spend 70%, then his percentage would be 70% of the new income, so 70% as before. But that doesn't match any options except if the options don't have 70%, which they don't.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Maybe when his income increases, his expenditure also increases by 20%, meaning his absolute spending goes up by 20%, and then we compute the new percentage.\n\nBut that would mean:\n\nOriginal expenditure: 0.7I.\n\nAfter 20% increase, new expenditure is 0.7I * 1.2 = 0.84I.\n\nNew income is 1.2I.\n\nSo the new percentage is (0.84I)/(1.2I) = 0.7 \u2192 70%, which again isn't an option.\n\nHmm, so that's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe question says: \"A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\"\n\nThe key is whether the expenditure is fixed in absolute terms or in percentage terms.\n\nIf the problem states that he continues to spend 70% of his income, then his expenditure as a percentage remains 70%. But since the options don't have that, I must have misread something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is saying that his expenditure is fixed in absolute terms, so when his income increases, the percentage of income spent decreases.\n\nSo let's model that.\n\nOriginal income: I.\n\nExpenditure: 0.7I.\n\nAfter income increases by 20%, new income is 1.2I.\n\nExpenditure remains 0.7I.\n\nSo new percentage is (0.7I) / (1.2I) = 0.7/1.2 = 0.583333..., which is 58.333...%, so option A.\n\nBut then why is the question phrased as \"spends 70% of his income\"? That would imply that regardless of income, he's spending 70% of it. So perhaps the confusion is between absolute spending and percentage.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think that his spending is a fixed amount, not a percentage. So if he used to spend 70% of his income, which is 0.7I, and his income increases by 20%, his spending remains 0.7I. So as a percentage of the new income, it's 0.7I / 1.2I = 58.3%.\n\nSo that leads me to option A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that his expenditure is fixed as 70% of his income, which would mean that if his income increases, his spending also increases proportionally. But that would mean his spending as a percentage remains 70%, which isn't an option.\n\nSo perhaps the correct interpretation is that his absolute expenditure remains the same, and we need to find the new percentage.\n\nThus, the answer is A)58.3%.\n\n\nThe problem involves a man who initially spends 70% of his income. When his income increases by 20%, the question asks for his new expenditure as a percentage of his new income. \n\nTo solve this, assume the man's original income is \\( I \\). His initial expenditure is \\( 0.7I \\). After his income increases by 20%, his new income becomes \\( 1.2I \\). The problem does not indicate that his absolute expenditure changes, so his expenditure remains \\( 0.7I \\). \n\nThe new expenditure as a percentage of the new income is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{New expenditure percentage} = \\frac{\\text{Expenditure}}{\\text{New income}} \\times 100 = \\frac{0.7I}{1.2I} \\times 100 = \\frac{0.7}{1.2} \\times 100 \\approx 58.3\\%.\n\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is **58.3%**, which corresponds to option A.\n\nAnswer: A",
