      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. So, the question is about toys, boxes, and tempos, which I think are like trucks or something that carry things. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nFive dozen toys are packed in a box. Hmm, right, a dozen is 12, so five dozen would be 5 times 12. Let me calculate that. 5 * 12 is 60. So each box contains 60 toys.\n\nNext part: 98 boxes are kept in a tempo. So one tempo can carry 98 boxes. And each box has 60 toys, right? So to find out how many toys one tempo can carry, I should multiply the number of boxes per tempo by the number of toys per box. So 98 boxes * 60 toys/box.\n\nWait, let me do that multiplication. 98 * 60. Let me break it down. 100 * 60 is 6000, but since it's 98, that's 2 less. So 2 *60 is 120. So 6000 - 120 = 5880. So each tempo can carry 5880 toys in one round.\n\nThe question is, how many tempos are needed to lift 29400 toys in one round? So we need to find how many tempos multiplied by their capacity equals 29400.\n\nSo let me write that as an equation. Let x be the number of tempos. Then:\n\nx * 5880 = 29400\n\nTo find x, I'll divide both sides by 5880.\n\nx = 29400 / 5880\n\nHmm, let me calculate that. Well, 5880 times 5 is 29400. Because 5880 *5: 5000*5=25000, 800*5=4000, 80*5=400, 0*5=0. So 25000 + 4000 is 29000, plus 400 is 29400. So yes, 5 times 5880 is 29400.\n\nSo x is 5. So the number of tempos needed is 5.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 5. So the answer should be B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine how many tempos are needed to lift 29,400 toys in one round, we start by calculating the number of toys each tempo can carry. \n\n1. **Toys per box**: Each box contains 5 dozen toys, and since 1 dozen = 12, this is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 12 = 60 \\text{ toys per box.}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Toys per tempo**: Each tempo carries 98 boxes, so the number of toys per tempo is:\n   \\[\n   98 \\times 60 = 5,880 \\text{ toys per tempo.}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Number of tempos needed**: To find how many tempos are required to carry 29,400 toys, we divide the total number of toys by the number of toys each tempo can carry:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{29,400}{5,880} = 5.\n   \\]\n\nThus, 5 tempos are needed to lift 29,400 toys in one round.

The question says, \"Five dozen toys are packed in a box and 98 boxes are kept in a tempo. How many tempos can lift 29400 toys in one round?\" The options are A to E, with numbers 4,5,7,6,8.\n\nHmm, let me break it down. First, I need to understand the units and what each part means. So, five dozen toys in a box. Wait, a dozen is 12, right? So five dozen would be 5 times 12. Let me calculate that. 5 * 12 is 60. So each box contains 60 toys.\n\nNext, the problem says 98 boxes are kept in a tempo. Oh, right, a tempo is like a van or a vehicle used for transportation. So each tempo can carry 98 boxes. But each box has 60 toys, so I should find out how many toys one tempo can carry in one round.\n\nLet me compute that. So, 98 boxes multiplied by 60 toys per box. Let me do the math. 98 * 60. Hmm, 98 times 60. Well, 100 times 60 is 6000, so subtract 2 times 60 (which is 120) from that. So 6000 - 120 = 5880. So each tempo can carry 5880 toys in one round.\n\nNow, the question is asking how many tempos are needed to carry 29400 toys in one round. So, I need to find out how many times 5880 goes into 29400. In other words, divide 29400 by 5880.\n\nLet me do that division. 29400 \u00f7 5880. Hmm, alternatively, I can simplify this by dividing numerator and denominator by 100 first, which gives 294 \u00f7 58.8. Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of how many times 5880 fits into 29400.\n\nAnother approach is to see if I can simplify the numbers. Let's see: 5880 multiplied by 5 is 29400. Because 5880 * 5. Let me check:\n\n5880 * 5: 5000 *5 is 25000, 800*5 is 4000 (so 25000+4000=29000), 80*5=400, and 0*5=0. So 29000 + 400 = 29400. Oh, right! So 5880 *5 =29400. That means one tempo can carry 5880 toys, and five tempos would carry 29400 toys in total.\n\nSo the number of tempos needed is 5. Looking at the options, option B is 5. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, did I miss anything? Let me go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst, 5 dozen is 60 toys per box. Each tempo holds 98 boxes, so 98 *60=5880 toys per tempo. Total toys needed:29400. Dividing 29400 by 5880 gives 5. Yep, that looks right. So the correct answer is B)5.\n",
