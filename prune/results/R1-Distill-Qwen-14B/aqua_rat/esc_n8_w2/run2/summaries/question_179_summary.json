      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about calculating the cost of gardening a boundary around a rectangular plot. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nAlright, the question says the plot is rectangular and has a perimeter of 340 meters. They want to create a 1-meter broad boundary around it. The rate is 10 per square meter. I need to find the cost, which depends on the area of this boundary.\n\nWait, so the boundary is like a strip around the rectangle. Since it's 1 meter wide, the area of the boundary would be the area of the larger rectangle (including the boundary) minus the area of the original plot.\n\nBut wait, how do I find the area of the boundary? Let me think. Oh right, if the original plot has a perimeter P, then the area of the boundary is the perimeter multiplied by the width of the boundary. But wait, is that correct? Or is there another way?\n\nWait, I remember that when you add a border around a rectangle, the new perimeter includes the original sides plus the added strips. Alternatively, the area of the border can be calculated as perimeter of the original plot multiplied by the width of the border, plus the area of the four corners. Oh wait, no, because when you add a border, the corners are squares of the width. But if the border is 1 meter, then each corner adds 1x1 = 1 m\u00b2, and there are four corners, so 4 m\u00b2 total. So the area of the border is (perimeter * width) + (4 * width\u00b2). But wait, wait, when you add a 1m wide border around a rectangle, the total area becomes (L+2w)(W+2w) - LW, where w is the width. So that's LW + 2w(L + W) +4w\u00b2 - LW. Which simplifies to 2w(L + W) +4w\u00b2. Since the perimeter P is 2(L+W), so that becomes w*P + 4w\u00b2. Oh right, so the area of the border is w*P +4w\u00b2.\n\nIn this case, w is 1m, so area is 1 * 340 + 4*(1)^2 = 340 +4 = 344 m\u00b2. So the area is 344 square meters.\n\nWait, but another approach: the area of the border is the area of the outer rectangle minus the inner. The outer rectangle has length and width increased by 2m each (because 1m on each side). So if the original plot has length L and width W, the perimeter is 2(L + W) = 340, so L + W = 170.\n\nThe area of the border is (L+2)(W+2) - L*W. Let's compute that:\n\n(L+2)(W+2) = LW + 2L + 2W +4 = LW + 2(L+W) +4.\n\nSo the border area is LW + 2(L+W) +4 - LW = 2(L+W) +4 = 2*(170) +4 = 340 +4=344 m\u00b2.\n\nYes, same result. So the area is 344 m\u00b2.\n\nThen, the cost is 10 per square meter, so 344 *10 = 3440.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 3440. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but another thought: could the question be referring to the cost of the boundary as a path, which is a 1m wide strip around the plot. So, the area is indeed 344 m\u00b2. So the cost is 344*10=3440, which is option C.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo calculate the cost of gardening a 1-meter-wide boundary around a rectangular plot with a perimeter of 340 meters at a rate of 10 per square meter, we first determine the area of the boundary.\n\nThe boundary is a 1-meter-wide strip around the rectangular plot. The area of the boundary can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of boundary} = \\text{Perimeter} \\times \\text{Width of boundary} + 4 \\times (\\text{Width of boundary})^2\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n- Perimeter \\( P = 340 \\, \\text{m} \\),\n- Width of boundary \\( w = 1 \\, \\text{m} \\),\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of boundary} = 340 \\times 1 + 4 \\times (1)^2 = 340 + 4 = 344 \\, \\text{m}^2\n\\]\n\nThe cost of gardening is then calculated by multiplying the area of the boundary by the rate per square meter:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost} = 344 \\times 10 = 3440\n\\]\n\nThus, the total cost is 3440, which corresponds to option C.\n\nAnswer: C",

Hmm, let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says: What will be the cost of gardening a 1-metre broad boundary around a rectangular plot having a perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre? The options are A to E.\n\nAlright, so I need to find the cost, which depends on the area of the boundary and the rate. The rate is 10 per square metre, so once I find the area, I can multiply by 10 to get the cost.\n\nWait, the boundary is 1 metre broad. So it's like a border around the rectangle. I think this is similar to finding the area of a path around a rectangle. The area of this path would be the area of the larger rectangle minus the area of the original plot.\n\nBut wait, the problem gives the perimeter of the plot, which is 340 metres. Perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + width). So if I let the length be L and width be W, then 2(L+W) = 340. So L + W = 170.\n\nBut wait, I don't know L or W individually, only their sum. That might complicate things. Because the area of the original plot is L*W. But without knowing L and W, how can I find the area of the path?\n\nWait, maybe there's another way. The area of the boundary (the path) can be calculated as the perimeter multiplied by the width of the path. Oh right! Because when you add a border around a rectangle, the area added is approximately the perimeter times the width of the border. But wait, is that exactly correct?\n\nWait, let me think. The area of the larger rectangle (including the path) would be (L + 2*1) * (W + 2*1), because the path is 1m wide on all sides. So the area of the path is [(L+2)(W+2)] - (L*W).\n\nLet me expand that: L*W + 2L + 2W +4 - L*W = 2L + 2W +4. So the area of the path is 2(L + W) +4. Oh, because 2L + 2W is 2*(L+W) and then +4.\n\nBut since the perimeter is 2*(L+W) = 340, so L+W = 170. So substituting that into the area of the path: 2*(170) +4 = 340 +4 = 344 square meters.\n\nOh, so the area is 344. Then the cost is 344 * 10, which is 3440. Looking at the options, option C is 3440.\n\nWait a minute, but is there a case where this approach is incorrect? Like if the original plot was a square, but in this case, it's a rectangle, but regardless, the perimeter gives us enough to compute the area of the path.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is that the area of the path is equal to perimeter * width of the path + 4*(width^2). Because when you add the path, the corners add extra squares. Since the width is 1m, the extra area is 4*(1*1) = 4. So, perimeter is 340, so 340*1 +4=344. That's the same as before.\n\nSo yes, the area is 344. Multiply by 10 gives 3440, so option C.\n",
