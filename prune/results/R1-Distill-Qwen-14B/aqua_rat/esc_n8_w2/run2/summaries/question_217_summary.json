      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about Mr. Jain betting on horses in a race. There are 5 horses, and he selects two at random. The probability that he selected the winning horse is what we're looking for.\n\nWait, wait. Let me read it again. Oh, right, the winning horse. So in a race, one horse wins, right? So, the probability that among the two horses he picks, at least one is the winner. Or wait, does the question mean he bets on both, and either one of them could win? Or does it mean that he selected two horses, and the probability that one of them is the winning horse.\n\nWait, the question says, \"the probability that he selected the winning horse.\" Oh, maybe I misread. So, does it mean he selects two horses, and the winning horse is one of them? Or does he have to select the exact winning horse? Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the phrasing is that he bets on two horses, and the probability that the winning horse is among them. Because the winning horse is just one, right? So, if he picks two, what's the chance that the winning one is in those two.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is simpler. Let me think. So, there are 5 horses. The winning horse is one of them. Mr. Jain picks two horses at random. What's the probability that the winning horse is among those two.\n\nSo, the probability that he selected the winning horse. So, in other words, the winning horse is one specific horse out of five. He selects two, so what's the chance that his two includes that one.\n\nSo, the total number of possible ways to select two horses from five is combination 5 choose 2. Let me calculate that. 5C2 is (5*4)/(2*1) = 10. So there are 10 possible pairs.\n\nNow, how many of those pairs include the winning horse? Well, the winning horse is one specific horse. So, if he picks that horse, the second horse can be any of the remaining four. So the number of favorable pairs is 4. Because he pairs the winning horse with each of the other four.\n\nSo the probability is favorable over total. So 4/10, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, another way to think about it is: the probability that the winning horse is selected when choosing two. Alternatively, the probability that he selects the winning horse in his two picks.\n\nAlternatively, the probability that he selects the winning horse is the same as 1 minus the probability that he doesn't select it. So, the probability he doesn't pick the winning horse is (4C2)/5C2. Because he has to choose two from the other four non-winning horses.\n\n4C2 is (4*3)/(2*1) =6. So 6/10 is the probability he doesn't pick the winner. So 1 - 6/10 =4/10=2/5. So that's the same answer as before.\n\nSo the probability is 2/5, which is option B.\n",

Mr. Jain selects two horses at random and bets on them. We need to find the probability that he selected the winning horse. The options are A)1/5, B)2/5, C)3/5, D)4/5, E)6/5.\n\nHmm, wait, probability questions can sometimes be tricky, but let's break it down. I think the key here is to figure out the chance that at least one of the two horses he picks is the winner. Or maybe the probability that he didn't pick the winner? No, wait, the question says he bets on both, so I think the correct approach is to find the probability that one of his two choices is the winning horse.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Let me read the question again to make sure I get it right. It says he selects two horses at random and bets on them. The probability that he selected the winning horse. Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Is he selecting two horses, and we're to find the probability that one of those two is the winner? Because in a race, only one horse wins, I assume.\n\nSo, the total number of horses is 5. He picks two. The probability that at least one of them is the winner.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking the probability that both horses he selected are the winners. But that doesn't make sense because in a race, only one horse is the winner. Oh wait, perhaps the question is in a different context. Maybe in this context, each horse has a chance to win, but perhaps the race allows for multiple winners? But the question doesn't specify that. So I'll proceed with the assumption that there's only one winning horse.\n\nSo, the problem is about selecting two horses out of five, and we need to find the probability that at least one of them is the winning horse.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking the probability that he selected the winning horse. Wait, wait, wait. Let me rephrase the problem: He selects two horses at random and bets on them. So, when he bets on them, perhaps the bet is that one of the two will win. So the question is, what is the probability that at least one of the two horses he chose is the winner.\n\nSo, to calculate this, perhaps the easiest way is to calculate the probability of the complementary event (i.e., neither of his two horses is the winner) and then subtract that from 1.\n\nSo, the complementary probability is the probability that both horses he selected are not the winning horse.\n\nLet me think about the total number of possible ways he can select two horses. Since he's choosing two out of five, the number of possible combinations is C(5,2). C(n,k) is the combination formula, which is n!/(k!(n-k)!).\n\nC(5,2) is (5*4)/(2*1) = 10 possible pairs.\n\nNow, how many of those pairs include the winning horse? Well, if there's one winning horse, then the number of favorable pairs is the number of ways to choose one more horse from the remaining four. So that's C(4,1) = 4.\n\nSo the number of favorable outcomes is 4, and the total is 10, so the probability is 4/10, which simplifies to 2/5. So that's option B.\n\nWait, but wait another approach. Alternatively, the probability that the first horse he picks is the winner is 1/5, and then the second horse is any of the remaining four. But that's not quite right because when you select two horses, the order doesn't matter. So perhaps another approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, the probability that he didn't pick the winning horse in either selection. So, the chance that his first horse is not the winner is 4/5. Then, given that, the chance that his second horse is not the winner is 3/4, because one horse is already chosen and it's not the winner. So the probability that neither is the winner is (4/5) * (3/4) = 12/20 = 3/5. So the probability that at least one is the winner is 1 - 3/5 = 2/5.\n\nOh wait, that's the same result as before. So either way, the probability is 2/5. So the correct answer is B.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: the probability that he selects the winning horse in at least one of the two selections.\n\nWait, when selecting two horses, the chance that the winning horse is among them is the same as 1 minus the probability that both are non-winners.\n\nSo, as calculated earlier, 1 - (4/5)(3/4) = 1 - 3/5 = 2/5.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the probability that the winning horse is the first one he picks is 1/5. The probability that the winning horse is the second one he picks, given that the first wasn't, is (4/5) * (1/4) = (4/5)*(1/4) = 1/5. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, because in the case where he picks two horses, the order doesn't matter. So maybe the correct way is to compute the probability that either of the two is the winner.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the number of favorable pairs over total pairs. The number of favorable pairs is all pairs that include the winning horse. How many are those? Well, the winning horse can pair with any of the other four, so 4 pairs. Total pairs are 10, so 4/10 = 2/5.\n\nYes, that's the same answer again. So I'm confident that the answer is B) 2/5.\n",
