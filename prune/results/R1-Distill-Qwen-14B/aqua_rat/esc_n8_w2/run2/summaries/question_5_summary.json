      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a trader who sold an article at a 20% profit for Rs.360. I need to find the cost price. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nWait, profit percentage is based on the cost price, right? So if the trader made a 20% profit, that means the selling price is 120% of the cost price. Oh right, because 100% would be the cost, and 20% added on top is the profit.\n\nThe selling price is given as Rs.360. So I can set up an equation where 120% of the cost price equals 360. Let me write that out. \n\nSo, 120% of CP = SP. That translates to 1.2 * CP = 360. To find CP, I need to divide both sides by 1.2. \n\nWait, 360 divided by 1.2. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 360 divided by 1.2. I can think of it as 360 divided by (6/5) because 1.2 is 6/5. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So 360 * (5/6). \n\nLet me compute that: 360 divided by 6 is 60, and 60 multiplied by 5 is 300. So the cost price should be 300. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is 300. So that must be the correct answer.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again. A trader sold an article at a profit of 20% for Rs.360. I need to find the cost price. Hmm, okay, so the selling price is 360, and the profit is 20%. Wait, I remember that profit is calculated based on the cost price. So the formula for profit percentage is (Profit / Cost Price) * 100. \n\nWait, right. So the selling price is the cost price plus the profit. So Selling Price (SP) = Cost Price (CP) + Profit. And Profit is 20% of CP, which is 0.2 * CP. So putting it together, SP = CP + 0.2*CP = 1.2 * CP.\n\nSo the equation is 360 = 1.2 * CP. To find CP, I can divide both sides by 1.2. Let me calculate that. 360 divided by 1.2. Let's see, 1.2 times 300 is 360 because 300 * 1 = 300 and 300 * 0.2 = 60, so 300 +60=360. Oh wait, that's right! So CP is 300.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 300. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, just to double-check. If the cost price is 300, then 20% of that is 60. Adding that to CP gives 360, which matches the selling price. Yep, that makes sense. No mistakes there.\n",
