      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hollow cube, and I need to figure out how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted after the outer surface is painted. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, the cube is 5 cm in size, and each small cube is 1 cm, so the cube is made up of 5x5x5 smaller cubes. Wait, but it's a hollow cube with a thickness of 1 cm. Oh right, that means the inside is empty, so the walls are 1 cm thick. So the cube isn't solid; it's like a box with walls that are 1 cm thick on all sides.\n\nSo the total number of small cubes in the hollow cube would be the volume of the outer cube minus the inner hollow part. The outer cube is 5x5x5, which is 125 small cubes. The inner hollow part would be a cube of size 3x3x3, because each side is reduced by 2 cm (1 cm on each side). So 3x3x3 is 27. Therefore, the hollow cube has 125 - 27 = 98 small cubes. Wait, but each small cube is 1 cm\u00b3, right? So the total number of small cubes is 98.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the faces of these small cubes that remain unpainted. So the outer surfaces are painted, and the inner surfaces are not painted, but the inner part is hollow, so their outer surfaces would be inner walls of the hollow cube. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify.\n\nThe outer surfaces of the hollow cube are painted, which includes the outer faces of the small cubes on the exterior of the hollow cube. The inner surfaces (the hollow part) are not painted because there's nothing there. So, any small cube that's part of the hollow walls will have some faces painted, and others not.\n\nWait, but each small cube in the hollow walls will have some faces exposed to the outside (and thus painted) and others exposed to the hollow interior (which isn't painted). But for the inner faces of the hollow cube, those would be part of the inner walls, but since the hollow is empty, those inner faces of the small cubes wouldn't be painted either. Or wait, no\u2014since the hollow's inner walls are part of the structure, but the problem states that only the outer surface is painted. So only the outer faces of the small cubes are painted; the inner faces of the hollow cube's walls are not painted.\n\nWait, no, the problem says the outer surface is painted. So the inner surfaces of the hollow cube are not painted, but those inner surfaces are part of the small cubes' faces. So each small cube in the hollow walls will have one face painted (the outer one) and the opposite face not painted, as it's part of the hollow. But wait, some small cubes might be at edges or corners, so they have more than one face painted.\n\nSo the problem is to find the total number of faces of all the small cubes that remain unpainted. Each small cube can have 0, 1, 2, or 3 painted faces, depending on their position in the structure. But the question is about the total number of unpainted faces across all small cubes.\n\nHmm, another approach: For each small cube in the hollow cube, count how many of their faces are unpainted, and sum all those across all cubes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the total number of faces of all small cubes and subtract the number of painted faces.\n\nEach small cube has 6 faces. There are 98 small cubes, so total faces are 98 *6 = 588.\n\nNow, how many of these faces are painted? Each face of the hollow cube's outer surface is painted. The hollow cube's outer dimensions are 5x5x5. Each face of the hollow cube is a 5x5 square of small cube faces. So each face has 25 small cube faces painted.\n\nThere are 6 faces on a cube, so total painted faces are 6 * 25 = 150. But wait, wait, that's the total number of outer faces. But wait, each small cube on the edge or corner contributes multiple painted faces. But when I'm just calculating the total number of painted faces, it's simply the sum of all the outer surfaces.\n\nSo total painted faces = 6*(5^2) = 150.\n\nSo the total unpainted faces would be the total faces minus painted faces: 588 - 150 = 438.\n\nWait, but wait a second. I think I'm making a mistake here. Because the inner surfaces of the hollow cube are not painted, but those are part of the small cubes' faces. So each small cube in the hollow walls has some faces that are on the outside (painted) and some on the inside (unpainted). So perhaps the total painted faces are only 150, but the unpainted faces include all the inner faces and any faces not on the outside.\n\nWait, no. Because the hollow cube's inner surfaces are part of the small cubes, but since they're not painted, those are unpainted. So the total number of painted faces is 150, and the total number of faces is 588, so unpainted would be 588-150=438. But wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, the hollow cube's inner surfaces are the inner walls. Each small cube in the hollow walls will have one face on the outside (painted) and another face on the inside (unpainted). But for the cubes on the edges or corners, they have more than one face painted. So when calculating the total painted faces, perhaps I should just count all the outer surfaces.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as:\n\nEach face of the hollow cube has 5x5=25 small cube faces painted. So 6 *25=150 painted faces.\n\nEach small cube in the hollow cube has 0, 1, 2, or 3 painted faces. The ones on the corners have 3 painted, edges have 2, and faces have 1. The inner cubes (like the ones in the hollow's inner part) are not part of the structure, since the hollow is empty. Wait, no, the hollow cube is made of a 1cm thick wall, so the inner part is 3x3x3, but that's empty, so the small cubes are only on the exterior 1 cm.\n\nWait, no, the hollow cube's structure is a 5x5x5 cube with a 3x3x3 hollow inside, so the cubes are only the outer layer. So each small cube in this structure is on the exterior. So each small cube is part of the outer surface, so each has at least one face painted. But some have more than one.\n\nWait, but no, the hollow cube's thickness is 1 cm. So the structure is a 5x5x5 cube, with a 3x3x3 hollow inside. So the small cubes are arranged in the outer layer only. So each small cube is part of the exterior, so they all have at least one face painted.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the hollow cube's walls are 1 cm thick, so each face of the hollow cube is a 5x5 grid of small cube faces. The small cubes in the hollow walls are arranged in a way that each has one face on the outside (painted) and adjacent to the hollow. So each small cube in the hollow walls has exactly one face painted (the outer one). Because they're on the exterior, but only one face is on the outside. The other faces are either adjacent to other small cubes in the structure or to the hollow.\n\nWait, no. Let me think about the arrangement. For a hollow cube with thickness 1 cm, the structure is like a cube shell. Each small cube is on the exterior, but they form a 5x5x5 cube. The inner 3x3x3 is empty. So each small cube in the shell is in the outer layer, but some are on edges or corners, which have multiple faces exposed.\n\nFor example, the corner cubes of the hollow cube would each have three faces exposed (painted). The edge cubes (not corners) would have two faces exposed. The face cubes (not edges or corners) would have one face exposed. And any cube that's inside the shell (but not on the outer surface) would have zero faces exposed, but wait, in this case, the shell is 1 cm thick, so all cubes are on the outer surface, right?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the hollow cube is 5 cm, so each face is a 5x5 square. The thickness is 1 cm, so each face has a 3x3 inner square (3 cm from each edge) that is hollow. So the cubes on each face are arranged in a 5x5 grid, but the inner 3x3 is hollow. So the cubes on the face are the perimeter of each face, but only one cube thick.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way to model this is to think of the hollow cube as a 5x5x5 cube minus a 3x3x3 cube. So the small cubes in the hollow cube are those that are in the outer layer of the 5x5x5 cube, but not in the inner 3x3x3.\n\nSo each small cube is either on the corner, edge, or face of the hollow cube. Let's calculate how many small cubes are in each category.\n\nCorners: A cube has 8 corners. Each corner cube has 3 painted faces. So 8 cubes, each contributing 3 painted faces, but wait, that's for the total. But wait, each corner cube is part of the hollow cube's structure.\n\nEdges: Each edge of the cube is 5 cm, but the hollow is 3 cm inside, so each edge has 5 - 2*1 = 3 small cubes in the edge? No, wait, the edges are 5 cm, and the thickness is 1 cm, so each edge is 5 small cubes long. But the corners are already counted. So each edge has 5 small cubes, but subtract the two corners (which are already counted in the corners), so each edge has 3 edge-only cubes. Since a cube has 12 edges, that's 12 *3=36 edge cubes. Each edge cube has two painted faces.\n\nFaces: Each face of the cube is a 5x5 square. The hollow is 3x3, so the face has a 5x5 grid. Subtract the inner 3x3, which is hollow, so the face's perimeter is 5x5 -3x3=25-9=16 small cubes. But the corners and edges have already been counted. So each face has 16 - 8 (corners) - 12 (edges) = 16-20? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I should think differently.\n\nEach face has (5x5) small cubes. Subtract the inner 3x3, which is the hollow part, so the number of cubes on each face is 5x5 -3x3 = 25-9=16. These 16 include the edges and corners of that face.\n\nBut since the entire cube is being considered, the 16 cubes per face include the four edges (each edge has 5 cubes, but we've already subtracted the corners, so 3 per edge?), but perhaps I'm complicating this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the number of small cubes in each category:\n\n- Corners: 8 cubes, each with 3 painted faces.\n\n- Edges: Each edge has (5-2)=3 cubes (excluding the corners). So 12 edges *3 =36 cubes, each with 2 painted faces.\n\n- Faces: Each face has (5x5) - (3x3) =16 cubes. But the 8 corners and 12 edges (per face?) are already counted. Alternatively, each face has (5-2)*(5-2)=9 cubes that are not on any edge or corner? No, that's not right.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach: each face of the hollow cube has a perimeter of small cubes. The perimeter of a 5x5 square is 5*4 -4 =16 (since each corner is counted once). So each face has 16 cubes on its perimeter, which includes the 4 corners and 12 edges (but each edge is 5 cubes, but subtract the corners).\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should use the inclusion-exclusion method.\n\nTotal small cubes in the hollow cube: 5^3 -3^3=125-27=98.\n\nEach cube is either a corner, edge, or face cube. Let's compute:\n\nCorners: 8 cubes, each with 3 painted faces.\n\nEdges (excluding corners): Each edge has 5-2=3 cubes. 12 edges *3=36 cubes, each with 2 painted faces.\n\nFaces (excluding edges and corners): Each face has (5-2)*(5-2)=3x3=9 cubes, but wait, that's 9 per face, so 6 faces *9=54. But wait, that's more than the total number of small cubes (98). Because 8+36=44, 44+54=98. So yes, that adds up.\n\nSo each face cube (excluding edges and corners) has 1 painted face.\n\nSo total painted faces:\n\nCorners: 8 cubes *3 =24.\n\nEdges:36 cubes *2=72.\n\nFaces:54 cubes *1=54.\n\nTotal painted faces =24+72+54=150. Which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nSo the total number of painted faces is 150.\n\nThe total number of small cube faces is 98 *6 =588.\n\nSo the unpainted faces would be 588 -150=438.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 438, so that's the answer.\n",

But wait, each corner cube is part of the hollow cube's structure.\n\nEdges: Each edge of the cube is 5 cm, but the hollow is 3 cm inside, so each edge has 5 - 2*1 = 3 small cubes in the edge? No, wait, the edges are 5 cm, and the thickness is 1 cm, so each edge is 5 small cubes long. But the corners are already counted. So each edge has 5 small cubes, but subtract the two corners (which are already counted in the corners), so each edge has 3 edge-only cubes. Since a cube has 12 edges, that's 12 *3=36 edge cubes. Each edge cube has two painted faces.\n\nFaces: Each face of the cube is a 5x5 square. The hollow is 3x3, so the face has a 5x5 grid. Subtract the inner 3x3, which is hollow, so the face's perimeter is 5x5 -3x3=25-9=16 small cubes. But the corners and edges have already been counted. So each face has 16 - 8 (corners) - 12 (edges) = 16-20? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I should think differently.\n\nEach face has (5x5) small cubes. Subtract the inner 3x3, which is the hollow part, so the number of cubes on each face is 5x5 -3x3 = 25-9=16.

Alternatively, each face has (5-2)*(5-2)=9 cubes that are not on any edge or corner? No, that's not right.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach: each face of the hollow cube has a perimeter of small cubes. The perimeter of a 5x5 square is 5*4 -4 =16 (since each corner is counted once). So each face has 16 cubes on its perimeter, which includes the 4 corners and 12 edges (but each edge is 5 cubes, but subtract the corners).\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should use the inclusion-exclusion method.\n\nTotal small cubes in the hollow cube: 5^3 -3^3=125-27=98.\n\nEach cube is either a corner, edge, or face cube.

But wait, that's more than the total number of small cubes (98). Because 8+36=44, 44+54=98. So yes, that adds up.\n\nSo each face cube (excluding edges and corners) has 1 painted face.\n\nSo total painted faces:\n\nCorners: 8 cubes *3 =24.\n\nEdges:36 cubes *2=72.\n\nFaces:54 cubes *1=54.\n\nTotal painted faces =24+72+54=150.

That means there's an empty space inside, right? The thickness is 1cm, so the walls of the hollow part are 1cm thick. So the hollow part is like a smaller cube inside. Let me visualize this. The outer part is the 5cm cube, and the inner part is hollow, with walls 1cm thick. So the inner hollow cube must be 5 - 2*1 = 3cm on each side. Because you subtract 1cm from both sides of each dimension.\n\nWait, but the cube is made of 1cm\u00b3 small cubes. So the total number of small cubes in the larger cube would be 5x5x5 = 125. But since it's hollow with 1cm thickness, the inner hollow part is 3x3x3 = 27. So the number of small cubes used is 125 - 27 = 98? Wait, but that's the total number of small cubes present in the structure.\n\nWait no, wait. Let me think again. If the cube is hollow, the small cubes form only the outer shell. So for each face of the big cube, there's a layer of small cubes. But perhaps I should calculate how many small cubes are on the outer surface.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should first think about how many small cubes are on the surface of the big cube. But wait, the big cube is hollow, so perhaps the inner structure is empty except for the walls. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nThe question is about the faces of the small cubes that remain unpainted. So when the outer surface is painted, the outer faces of the small cubes on the surface get painted. The inner faces (if any) and the faces not on the surface remain unpainted.\n\nWait, but in a hollow cube, the inner faces are not present because it's hollow. So each small cube that's part of the structure has some faces on the outside and some not. But the small cubes on the edges or corners will have more painted faces.\n\nWait, but perhaps a better approach is to find the total number of small cube faces that are on the outer surface of the big cube. Then, since each of these is painted, the remaining faces (those not on the surface) are unpainted. But wait, the question is about how many faces of the small cubes remain unpainted. So perhaps we need to calculate the total number of faces of all small cubes and subtract the painted ones.\n\nWait, but each small cube has 6 faces. The total number of small cubes is the number of cubes in the structure. Wait, but how many small cubes are there in the hollow cube?\n\nWait, the hollow cube has a thickness of 1cm. So the outer layer is 1cm thick. So the number of small cubes is the total number in a 5x5x5 cube minus the 3x3x3 inner hollow cube. So 125 - 27 = 98 small cubes. Each small cube has 6 faces, so total faces are 98 * 6 = 588.\n\nBut wait, some of these faces are on the exterior of the big cube and thus get painted. So the painted faces are the same as the number of faces on the exterior of the big cube.\n\nHow many faces are on the exterior of the big cube? Each face of the big cube is 5x5, so 25 squares. There are 6 faces, so 6 *25 = 150. So each face has 25 small cube faces. So 150 painted faces.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Each small cube on the corner is part of three faces, but each face counts it once. So in this approach, the total painted faces would be 150.\n\nSo if the total number of small cube faces is 588, and 150 are painted, then the unpainted would be 588 - 150 = 438. Hmm, looking at the options, option A is 438.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if this is the correct approach. Another way to think: each small cube has some faces painted. For each small cube, count the number of painted faces and sum them. Then subtract that from the total number of faces to get unpainted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about each small cube and count how many of its faces are not on the exterior.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to calculate the total number of small cube faces that are on the exterior, which is 150, as each face of the big cube is 25, times 6. So 150 painted faces. The total number of small cube faces is 98 *6=588. So 588-150=438 unpainted. That would make option A the answer.\n\nBut wait, another angle: the hollow cube is made up of small cubes, each with some faces on the outside. But perhaps some small cubes are on edges or corners, so their faces are counted multiple times. But wait, in the method I used earlier, each face of the big cube is counted separately, so each small cube's face is only counted once in the 150 total. So I think that approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial calculation of the number of small cubes is wrong. Let me think: the hollow cube with thickness 1 cm. So the outer layer is 1 cm, and the inner empty space is 3x3x3. So the number of small cubes in the hollow structure is 5^3 - 3^3 = 125 -27=98. So yes, 98 small cubes.\n\nEach has 6 faces, so 98*6=588. Painted faces: 6*(5^2) =6*25=150. So unpainted is 588-150=438.\n\nSo the answer should be option A)438.\n",
