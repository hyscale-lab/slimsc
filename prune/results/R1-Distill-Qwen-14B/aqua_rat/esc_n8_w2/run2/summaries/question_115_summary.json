      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: If n is such that 36 \u2264 n \u2264 72, then x = (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4\u221an + 4) satisfies which of the given options. The options are A to E, with different ranges for x.\n\nHmm, I need to simplify this expression for x to find its possible range when n is between 36 and 72. Let me see.\n\nFirst, looking at the numerator and the denominator. Both have n and \u221an terms. Maybe I can factor or simplify the expression somehow.\n\nThe numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16. Wait, that looks a bit like a quadratic in terms of \u221an. Let me check:\n\nLet me set a = \u221an. Then n = a\u00b2. Let's substitute that into the numerator:\n\nNumerator becomes a^4 + 2a*(a\u00b2 +4) +16. Let's expand that.\n\na^4 + 2a^3 + 8a +16.\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful yet. Let me look at the denominator. The denominator is n + 4\u221an +4, which in terms of a is a\u00b2 +4a +4. Oh wait, that's a perfect square. Because (a + 2)^2 is a\u00b2 +4a +4. So denominator simplifies to (a + 2)^2.\n\nSo denominator is (a+2)^2. So x is [a^4 + 2a^3 +8a +16] divided by (a+2)^2.\n\nWait, maybe the numerator can also be factored. Let me try to factor it.\n\nLooking at a^4 + 2a^3 +8a +16. Hmm, maybe group terms. Let's group a^4 +2a^3 and 8a +16.\n\na^3(a + 2) + 8(a + 2) = (a^3 +8)(a +2). Wait, that's a factor of (a +2). So numerator becomes (a^3 +8)(a +2).\n\nWait, a^3 +8 is a sum of cubes. It can be factored as (a + 2)(a\u00b2 -2a +4). So numerator is (a +2)(a\u00b2 -2a +4)(a +2) = (a +2)^2 (a\u00b2 - 2a +4).\n\nSo numerator is (a +2)^2 (a\u00b2 - 2a +4), denominator is (a +2)^2. So when we divide, the (a +2)^2 terms cancel out, assuming a \u2260 -2, which it can't be because a is sqrt(n), which is positive. So x simplifies to a\u00b2 - 2a +4.\n\nBut a is sqrt(n), so substituting back, a\u00b2 is n. So x = n - 2a +4. Wait, wait, because a is sqrt(n), so 2a is 2\u221an. So x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nHmm, that's a simpler expression. So x = n - 2\u221an +4. Now, given that n is between 36 and 72, I need to find the range of x.\n\nWait, let's make sure I did that correctly. The numerator was (a +2)^2 (a\u00b2 -2a +4), denominator (a +2)^2, so x = a\u00b2 -2a +4. Since a is sqrt(n), x = (sqrt(n))\u00b2 - 2 sqrt(n) +4 = n - 2\u221an +4. Yep, that's right.\n\nSo now, x = n - 2\u221an +4. I need to find the minimum and maximum values of x when n is between 36 and 72.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can treat x as a function of n and find its derivative to find minima and maxima, but since n is an integer in this case, or maybe not, but maybe treating it as a continuous variable is easier for finding the range.\n\nWait, the problem doesn't specify if n is integer, but since the range is 36 to 72, which are perfect squares, maybe n is a perfect square? Or maybe not, but I'll proceed as if n is a continuous variable because that's easier.\n\nSo, let's define x as a function of n: x(n) = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nI can find the derivative dx/dn to find where the function is increasing or decreasing.\n\nCompute derivative: dx/dn = 1 - (2*(1/(2\u221an))) )= 1 - (1/\u221an).\n\nSet derivative to zero to find critical points: 1 - (1/\u221an) = 0 \u2192 1 = 1/\u221an \u2192 \u221an = 1 \u2192 n=1.\n\nWait, but our domain is n between 36 and 72, which is much larger. So the critical point at n=1 is outside our domain. So within 36 \u2264n \u226472, the derivative dx/dn is positive or negative?\n\nCompute derivative at n=36: dx/dn = 1 - 1/\u221a36 = 1 - 1/6 = 5/6 \u22480.833, which is positive.\n\nAt n=72: dx/dn =1 -1/\u221a72. Let me compute \u221a72: 8.485, so 1/8.485\u22480.117. So 1 -0.117=0.883, which is still positive.\n\nSo the derivative is positive throughout the domain. That means the function x(n) is increasing on [36,72]. Therefore, the minimum x occurs at n=36 and the maximum at n=72.\n\nSo compute x at n=36:\n\nx(36) =36 - 2*\u221a36 +4 =36 -2*6 +4= 36-12+4=28.\n\nAt n=72: x(72)=72 - 2*\u221a72 +4. Let's compute \u221a72: \u221a72=6*sqrt(2)=approximately 8.485.\n\nSo 72 - 2*(8.485) +4. Let's calculate: 72 +4 =76. 2*8.485=16.97. 76-16.97=59.03.\n\nSo x at 72 is approximately 59.03.\n\nWait, but let me compute it more accurately. \u221a72 is exactly 6\u221a2, so 2\u221a72 is 12\u221a2, which is about 16.97056.\n\nSo x(72) =72 +4 - 12\u221a2 =76 -12\u221a2.\n\nCompute 12\u221a2: \u221a2\u22481.41421356. 12*1.41421356\u224816.9705627.\n\nSo 76 -16.9705627 \u224859.0294373.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption D is 28 < x <60. Because 59.03 is just under 60.\n\nWait, but wait: the question is about whether x is in those ranges. So x starts at 28 and ends at about 59.03. So the range is (28, 59.03). So which option includes all x in that interval?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)20 <x<54 \u2192 No, since x can go up to about 59.\n\nB)23<x<58 \u2192 No, since x can go up to about 59.03, which is beyond 58.\n\nC)25<x<64 \u2192 Yes, because 28 is above 25, and 59.03 is below 64. So all x in 28 to 59.03 would be within 25-64.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check. The x starts at 28 and goes up to about 59. So the range is 28 to 59.03.\n\nWhich of the options includes this entire range?\n\nOption D says 28 <x <60. So that's correct because 59.03 is less than 60. So x is between 28 and 60, so 28 <x<60. That's option D.\n\nBut wait, let me recheck the calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in the substitution.\n\nWait, x =n -2\u221an +4. At n=36: 36 -12 +4=28. Correct.\n\nAt n=72: 72 -2*\u221a72 +4. \u221a72 is 6\u221a2. So 72+4=76. 2*6\u221a2=12\u221a2. So 76-12\u221a2. Let me compute 12*1.41421356237=16.970562748.\n\n76-16.970562748=59.029437252.\n\nSo about 59.03, yes. So the maximum is less than 60. So the range is 28 <x <\u224859.03, which is within 28<x<60. So option D is 28<x<60. So D is correct.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption C is 25<x<64. Our x starts at 28, which is above 25, and the maximum is about 59.03, which is below 64. So option C also includes the range, but D is more precise.\n\nBut wait, the question is which option is satisfied. So the x is between 28 and 59.03. So the correct option is the one that includes all x in that interval.\n\nOption D says 28 <x <60. That's correct because 59.03 is less than 60.\n\nOption C is 25<x<64. That's also correct because 28>25 and 59.03<64. So both options C and D include the entire x range. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake because in the problem statement, the question is whether x satisfies one of the options. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA)20 <x <54\n\nB)23 <x <58\n\nC)25 <x <64\n\nD)28 <x <60\n\nE)None of these.\n\nOur x is between 28 and approximately 59.03.\n\nSo let's see:\n\nOption D: 28 <x <60. So our x is within 28 to 59.03, so yes, it's within D.\n\nOption C: 25 <x <64. Our x is 28 to 59.03, which is within 25-64. So C is also correct.\n\nWait, but both C and D are correct? That can't be right. Because the options are mutually exclusive.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the simplification. Let me go back and check.\n\nWait, earlier steps: x = (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n+4) +16)/(n +4\u221an +4). We set a=\u221an, so n=a\u00b2.\n\nSo numerator: a^4 + 2a(a\u00b2 +4) +16 = a^4 + 2a^3 +8a +16.\n\nDenominator: a\u00b2 +4a +4 = (a+2)^2.\n\nThen numerator: a^4 + 2a^3 +8a +16. Let's factor this.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me try grouping terms again.\n\na^4 +2a^3 +8a +16. Let's group a^4 +2a^3 and 8a +16.\n\na^3(a+2) + 8(a +2) = (a^3 +8)(a+2).\n\nYes, that's correct. And a^3 +8 is (a+2)(a\u00b2 -2a +4), so numerator becomes (a+2)(a^2 -2a +4)(a+2) = (a+2)^2 (a^2 -2a +4).\n\nDenominator is (a+2)^2. So x = (a^2 -2a +4) = n -2\u221an +4. That's correct.\n\nSo, x =n -2\u221an +4.\n\nAt n=36, x=36 - 12 +4=28.\n\nAt n=72, x=72 -2*\u221a72 +4=72+4 - 2*6\u221a2=76 -12\u221a2.\n\nCompute 12\u221a2: 12*1.41421356237=16.970562748. So 76 -16.970562748=59.029437252.\n\nSo x is between 28 and approximately 59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D says 28<x<60. So 59.03 is less than 60, so yes, x is within 28 to 60. So D is correct.\n\nOption C says 25<x<64. 28 is above 25, and 59.03 is below 64. So C is also correct.\n\nWait, but both can't be correct. Hmm. Let me check if the question allows x to reach exactly 28 or 60.\n\nWait, n starts at 36, which is included. So x=28 is included. Similarly, n=72 gives x=76 -12\u221a2\u224859.03. So x can be up to about 59.03, which is less than 60. So in option D, the upper limit is 60, so 59.03 is less than 60, so x <60 holds.\n\nBut option C's upper limit is 64, which is higher than 59.03, so x <64 holds as well.\n\nSo both options C and D include the x range. But the options are A to E, and only one is correct.\n\nHmm, but the question is phrased as \"satisfies\" the given condition. So perhaps the correct answer is the tightest bound that includes all x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the simplification. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the original expression can be simplified differently. Let me try another approach.\n\nLooking at the numerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16.\n\nLet me think about the numerator as a perfect square. Let's see if it can be written as (something)^2.\n\nSuppose the numerator is (n + a\u221an + b)^2.\n\nExpanding that would give n\u00b2 + 2a n^{3/2} + (a\u00b2 + 2b) n + 2ab \u221an + b\u00b2.\n\nComparing with the given numerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the numerator is (\u221an + something)^2.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me try to write the numerator as (n + k\u221an + m)^2, and see if it matches.\n\nExpanding (n +k\u221an + m)^2 = n\u00b2 + 2k n^{3/2} + (k\u00b2 + 2m) n + 2k m \u221an + m\u00b2.\n\nComparing with the numerator n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16.\n\nWait, the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16.\n\nLet me expand that: n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an + 8\u221an +16.\n\nSo the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an +8\u221an +16.\n\nSo when I compare with the expansion (n +k\u221an +m)^2, I have:\n\nn\u00b2 + 2k n^{3/2} + (k\u00b2 + 2m) n + 2k m \u221an + m\u00b2.\n\nWhich must equal to n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an +8\u221an +16.\n\nSo, let's match coefficients:\n\n1. Coefficient of n\u00b2: 1 on both sides. Good.\n\n2. Coefficient of n^{3/2}: 2k = 2n? Wait, wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. Wait, the term in the numerator is 2n\u221an = 2n^{3/2}.\n\nWait, in the expansion, the term is 2k n^{3/2}.\n\nSo 2k n^{3/2} must equal 2n^{3/2} \u2192 2k =2 \u2192 k=1.\n\n3. Next, the term in n: (k\u00b2 + 2m) n. The numerator has 0n (because the numerator's expansion is n\u00b2 + 2n^{3/2} +8\u221an +16). So (k\u00b2 +2m) must be 0.\n\nSince k=1, 1 + 2m =0 \u2192 m= -0.5.\n\n4. Next, the term in \u221an: 2k m \u221an. Substituting k=1 and m=-0.5: 2*1*(-0.5)= -1. So the term is -\u221an. But the numerator has +8\u221an. So that's a problem.\n\nHmm, that's not matching. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the numerator is (\u221an + a)^2 + something.\n\nWait, perhaps another way to factor. Let me try to factor the numerator.\n\nWait, another way: numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16.\n\nWait, that's n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an + 8\u221an +16.\n\nHmm, perhaps grouping terms:\n\nn\u00b2 + 2n\u221an + (8\u221an +16).\n\nWait, maybe the first three terms form a square: (n +\u221an)^2 =n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an +n.\n\nSo n\u00b2 +2n\u221an = (n +\u221an)^2 -n.\n\nSo the numerator is (n +\u221an)^2 -n +8\u221an +16.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numerator is (n + a\u221an + b)^2 + c.\n\nBut perhaps this isn't the most efficient way. Let me go back to the initial approach where x simplifies to n -2\u221an +4, which gives x between 28 and approximately 59.03.\n\nSo which option is correct? Let me check the options again.\n\nOption D is 28 < x <60. Since x can be up to about 59.03, which is less than 60, this holds.\n\nOption C is 25 <x<64. Since 28>25 and 59.03<64, this also holds.\n\nWait, but the question is asking which option is correct. So both C and D include the correct range, but perhaps I made a mistake in my simplification.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial simplification was incorrect. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, when I set a=\u221an, the numerator became a^4 +2a^3 +8a +16.\n\nI thought this factors into (a^3 +8)(a+2), but wait: (a^3 +8) is (a+2)(a\u00b2 -2a +4), so (a+2)(a\u00b2-2a+4) * (a+2) = (a+2)^2 (a\u00b2-2a+4).\n\nWait, but wait, when I multiply (a+2)^2 and (a\u00b2-2a+4), does that give a^4 +2a^3 +8a +16?\n\nLet me compute (a+2)^2 (a\u00b2-2a+4).\n\nFirst, (a+2)^2 = a\u00b2 +4a +4.\n\nMultiply by (a\u00b2 -2a +4):\n\n= (a\u00b2 +4a +4)(a\u00b2 -2a +4)\n\nLet me expand this:\n\na\u00b2*(a\u00b2 -2a +4) = a^4 -2a^3 +4a^2.\n\n4a*(a\u00b2 -2a +4) =4a^3 -8a^2 +16a.\n\n4*(a\u00b2 -2a +4)=4a^2 -8a +16.\n\nNow, add them together:\n\na^4 -2a^3 +4a^2 +4a^3 -8a^2 +16a +4a^2 -8a +16.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\na^4 + ( -2a^3 +4a^3 ) + (4a^2 -8a^2 +4a^2 ) + (16a -8a) +16.\n\nSo:\n\na^4 +2a^3 +0a^2 +8a +16.\n\nWhich matches the numerator a^4 +2a^3 +8a +16. So the factorization is correct.\n\nSo the simplification is correct, x =a^2 -2a +4 =n -2\u221an +4.\n\nSo at n=36, x=36-12+4=28.\n\nAt n=72, x=72 -2*\u221a72 +4=76-12\u221a2\u224859.03.\n\nSo the range of x is (28,59.03).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA)20 <x<54 \u2192 No, since x can go up to 59.\n\nB)23<x<58 \u2192 No, since x can be up to ~59.03, which is above 58.\n\nC)25<x<64 \u2192 Yes, because 28>25 and 59.03<64.\n\nD)28<x<60 \u2192 Yes, because 28 is the lower bound, and 59.03<60.\n\nE)None of these.\n\nSo both C and D include the correct range. But looking at the options, perhaps D is more precise because it starts exactly at 28, which is the minimum x, and goes up to 60, which is just above the maximum x.\n\nBut the question is which option is correct. Let me see the options again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"satisfies\". So if the correct range is 28 <x <59.03, then both options C and D include this range. But the problem expects only one correct option.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of x at n=72.\n\nLet me compute x at n=72 again.\n\nn=72, \u221an=\u221a72=6\u221a2\u22488.485281374.\n\nSo x=72 -2*(6\u221a2) +4.\n\n72+4=76.\n\n2*(6\u221a2)=12\u221a2\u224816.970562748.\n\n76-16.970562748\u224859.029437252.\n\nSo x\u224859.03.\n\nSo x is approximately 59.03, which is less than 60. So the upper limit is under 60, so option D says x<60, which holds.\n\nOption C says x<64, which also holds.\n\nSo the range of x is between 28 and approximately 59.03.\n\nSo which option correctly represents this?\n\nOption D is 28<x<60, which is correct.\n\nOption C is 25<x<64, which is also correct.\n\nHmm, but the options are supposed to be exclusive, so perhaps the correct answer is E) None of these.\n\nWait, but why? Because both C and D include the correct range, but the problem expects one correct option.\n\nWait, perhaps the x doesn't actually reach 28. Because when n=36, is that included?\n\nWait, the question says 36 \u2264n \u226472. So n can be 36, which gives x=28.\n\nSo x can be 28. So the correct range is 28 \u2264x \u226459.03.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them include 28 as a lower bound. Let's see:\n\nOption D is 28 <x <60. So it's a strict inequality, meaning x can't be 28. But x can be 28 when n=36. So that would make option D incorrect because x can equal 28.\n\nWait, but the original expression for x: x = (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16)/(n +4\u221an +4).\n\nAt n=36, the denominator is 36 +4*6 +4=36+24+4=64.\n\nNumerator is 36\u00b2 +2*6*(36+4)+16=1296 +2*6*40 +16=1296+480+16=1792.\n\nSo x=1792 /64 =28.\n\nSo x=28 is possible. So the correct range is 28 \u2264x \u226459.03.\n\nBut the options are all open intervals, not including the endpoints.\n\nSo none of the options A to D include x=28. Let me look again:\n\nOption D says 28 <x <60. So x can't be 28. But in reality, x can be 28 when n=36. So the correct range includes 28, but option D says x>28, so it's incorrect.\n\nSimilarly, option C says x>25, which is true since the minimum is 28. So x is always above 25, but the lower limit is 28, which is included.\n\nBut the options don't have an option that includes x=28. So perhaps the correct answer is E) None of these.\n\nWait, but let's think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are written as open intervals, but the actual x can reach up to 59.03, which is less than 60. So for option D, 28 <x <60 is true because x starts at 28 (inclusive) and goes up to 59.03, which is less than 60.\n\nBut since the option is 28 <x <60, which is an open interval, but x can be 28, then the correct x range includes 28, but the option D doesn't include it. So the option D is not fully correct.\n\nSimilarly, option C's lower bound is 25, which is below 28, so it's acceptable, but the upper limit is 64, which is higher than 59.03. So x is always less than 64, so option C is correct.\n\nWait, but since the x can reach 28, which is within option C's range (25<x<64), then x satisfies option C. Because 28 is greater than 25 and 59.03 is less than 64.\n\nBut wait, in reality, x can be as low as 28, which is higher than 25. So option C is correct.\n\nWait, but why did I think earlier that option D was correct?\n\nBecause when I computed x at n=36, I get x=28, which is the minimum value. But option D says x>28, which is not true because x can be 28.\n\nSo in that case, option D is incorrect because x can be exactly 28, which is not included in option D.\n\nSo the correct option would be C, because 25 <x <64 includes all x from 28 up to ~59, which is less than 64.\n\nBut wait, looking again: the x is between 28 and ~59.03, inclusive.\n\nSo for option C: 25 <x <64. Since 28>25 and 59.03<64, any x in 28 to 59.03 would satisfy 25<x<64.\n\nThus, option C is correct.\n\nBut wait, the problem says 36 \u2264n \u226472. So n=36 gives x=28, which is included, and n=72 gives x\u224859.03, which is less than 60.\n\nSo the x range is 28 \u2264x \u226459.03.\n\nLooking at the options, which one is satisfied?\n\nOption C: 25 <x <64 \u2192 x can be 28, which is >25, and up to 59.03 <64 \u2192 yes.\n\nOption D: 28 <x <60 \u2192 x can be 28 (n=36) which is not included in D. So D is incorrect.\n\nThus, the correct answer is C.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought x can't be exactly 28 because the option is open. But wait, the problem says \"satisfies\", which could mean that x is within the open interval.\n\nWait, but the actual x can reach 28 and 59.03. So for the options, which are open, the correct option would have to include these endpoints within the open interval.\n\nWait, but 28 is the minimum x, and option D starts at 28, but it's an open interval, so x must be greater than 28. But x can be exactly 28, so option D is incorrect.\n\nOption C: 25 <x <64 \u2192 28 is greater than 25, and 59.03 is less than 64. So for all x in our range, x is within C's range.\n\nThus, the correct option is C.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that D was correct. I'm getting a bit confused. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, when n=36, x=28 is included. So any option that includes x=28 must have 28 as the lower bound.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C: 25 <x <64 \u2192 28 is within this range.\n\nOption D:28 <x <60 \u2192 x=28 is not included, so this option is incorrect.\n\nSo the correct answer is C.\n\nWait, but the initial calculation suggested that the maximum x is ~59.03, which is under 60, so option D's upper limit is 60, which would include all x up to that.\n\nBut since the lower limit of D is 28 (exclusive), and x can be 28, D is not correct.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C.\n\nWait, but the problem's options don't have an option that includes x=28 in the lower bound. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider whether x can be exactly 28.\n\nYes, when n=36, x=28.\n\nBut the options are open intervals, so none of the options include x=28. So perhaps the correct answer is E) None of these.\n\nWait, because all the options A to D are open intervals, and x can be exactly 28, which is not included in any of the options except maybe C, but C's lower limit is 25, which is less than 28. So x=28 is within C's interval, but the problem is whether x can be exactly 28, which is possible.\n\nWait, but if the options are open intervals, then x=28 is not included in option C's interval (25 <x <64), because 28 is greater than 25, so 28 is within 25 <x <64. So option C is correct.\n\nBut wait, no. Open intervals don't include the endpoints. So 25 <x <64 means x is greater than 25 and less than 64. So x=28 is included because 28>25.\n\nSimilarly, x=59.03 is less than 64, so it's included.\n\nSo the correct answer is C.\n\nBut earlier I thought D was correct, but that's because I thought x starts at 28, but in reality, since x can be 28, which is included in C's interval.\n\nHmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to approach this differently.\n\nThe x simplifies to x =n -2\u221an +4.\n\nWe can compute x at n=36 and n=72.\n\nx=28 at n=36.\n\nx\u224859.03 at n=72.\n\nSo the range of x is [28, ~59.03].\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 x can be up to 59.03, which is beyond 54. So A is incorrect.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 x can be up to 59.03, which is beyond 58. So B is incorrect.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 28 is >25, and 59.03 <64. So C is correct.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 x can be 28, which is not included in D. So D is incorrect.\n\nThus, the correct answer is C.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that 36 \u2264n \u226472. So n can be 36, which makes x=28. So x can be 28. So for option C, x=28 is within 25 <x <64, so C is correct.\n\nBut earlier I thought option D was correct because I didn't consider that x can be exactly 28. But since option D starts at 28 (exclusive), it's incorrect.\n\nSo the correct answer is C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: If n is such that 36 \u2264 n \u2264 72, then x = (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4\u221an + 4) satisfies which of the given options. The options are A to E, with different ranges for x.\n\nHmm, I need to simplify this expression for x to find its possible range when n is between 36 and 72. Let me see.\n\nFirst, looking at the numerator and the denominator. Both have n and \u221an terms. Maybe I can factor or simplify the expression somehow.\n\nThe numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16. Wait, that looks a bit like a quadratic in terms of \u221an. Let me check:\n\nLet me set a = \u221an. Then n = a\u00b2. Let's substitute that into the numerator:\n\nNumerator becomes a^4 + 2a*(a\u00b2 +4) +16. Let's expand that.\n\na^4 + 2a^3 + 8a +16.\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful yet. Let me look at the denominator. The denominator is n + 4\u221an +4, which in terms of a is a\u00b2 +4a +4. Oh wait, that's a perfect square. Because (a + 2)^2 is a\u00b2 +4a +4. So denominator simplifies to (a + 2)^2.\n\nSo denominator is (a+2)^2. So x is [a^4 + 2a^3 +8a +16] divided by (a+2)^2.\n\nWait, maybe the numerator can also be factored. Let me try to factor it.\n\nLooking at a^4 + 2a^3 +8a +16. Hmm, maybe group terms. Let's group a^4 +2a^3 and 8a +16.\n\na^3(a + 2) + 8(a + 2) = (a^3 +8)(a +2). Wait, that's a factor of (a +2). So numerator becomes (a^3 +8)(a +2).\n\nWait, a^3 +8 is a sum of cubes. It can be factored as (a + 2)(a\u00b2 -2a +4). So numerator is (a +2)(a\u00b2 -2a +4)(a +2) = (a +2)^2 (a\u00b2 - 2a +4).\n\nSo numerator is (a +2)^2 (a\u00b2 - 2a +4), denominator is (a +2)^2. So when we divide, the (a +2)^2 terms cancel out, assuming a \u2260 -2, which it can't be because a is sqrt(n), which is positive. So x simplifies to a\u00b2 - 2a +4.\n\nBut a is sqrt(n), so substituting back, a\u00b2 is n. So x = n - 2a +4. Wait, wait, because a is sqrt(n), so 2a is 2\u221an. So x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nHmm, that's a simpler expression. So x = n - 2\u221an +4. Now, given that n is between 36 and 72, I need to find the range of x.\n\nWait, let's make sure I did that correctly. The numerator was (a +2)^2 (a\u00b2 -2a +4), denominator (a +2)^2, so x = a\u00b2 -2a +4. Since a is sqrt(n), x = (sqrt(n))\u00b2 - 2 sqrt(n) +4 = n - 2\u221an +4. Yep, that's right.\n\nSo now, x = n - 2\u221an +4. I need to find the minimum and maximum values of x when n is between 36 and 72.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can treat x as a function of n and find its derivative to find minima and maxima, but since n is an integer in this case, or maybe not, but maybe treating it as a continuous variable is easier for finding the range.\n\nWait, the problem doesn't specify if n is integer, but since the range is 36 to 72, which are perfect squares, maybe n is a perfect square? Or maybe not, but I'll proceed as if n is a continuous variable because that's easier.\n\nSo, let's define x as a function of n: x(n) = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nI can find the derivative dx/dn to find where the function is increasing or decreasing.\n\nCompute derivative: dx/dn = 1 - (2*(1/(2\u221an))) )= 1 - (1/\u221an).\n\nSet derivative to zero to find critical points: 1 - (1/\u221an) = 0 \u2192 1 = 1/\u221an \u2192 \u221an = 1 \u2192 n=1.\n\nWait, but our domain is n between 36 and 72, which is much larger. So the critical point at n=1 is outside our domain. So within 36 \u2264n \u226472, the derivative dx/dn is positive or negative?\n\nCompute derivative at n=36: dx/dn = 1 - 1/\u221a36 = 1 - 1/6 = 5/6 \u22480.833, which is positive.\n\nAt n=72: dx/dn =1 -1/\u221a72. Let me compute \u221a72: 8.485, so 1/8.485\u22480.117. So 1 -0.117=0.883, which is still positive.\n\nSo the derivative is positive throughout the domain. That means the function x(n) is increasing on [36,72]. Therefore, the minimum x occurs at n=36 and the maximum at n=72.\n\nSo compute x at n=36:\n\nx(36) =36 - 2*\u221a36 +4 =36 -2*6 +4= 36-12+4=28.\n\nAt n=72: x(72)=72 - 2*\u221a72 +4. Let's compute \u221a72: \u221a72=6*sqrt(2)=approximately 8.485.\n\nSo 72 - 2*(8.485) +4. Let's calculate: 72 +4 =76. 2*8.485=16.97. 76-16.97=59.03.\n\nSo x at 72 is approximately 59.03.\n\nWait, but let me compute it more accurately. \u221a72 is exactly 6\u221a2, so 2\u221a72 is 12\u221a2, which is about 16.97056.\n\nSo x(72) =72 +4 - 12\u221a2 =76 -12\u221a2.\n\nCompute 12\u221a2: \u221a2\u22481.41421356. 12*1.41421356\u224816.9705627.\n\nSo 76 -16.9705627 \u224859.0294373.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption D is 28 < x <60. Because 59.03 is just under 60.\n\nWait, but wait: the question is about whether x is in those ranges. So x starts at 28 and ends at about 59.03. So the range is (28, 59.03). So which option includes all x in that interval?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)20 <x<54 \u2192 No, since x can go up to about 59.\n\nB)23<x<58 \u2192 No, since x can go up to about 59.03, which is beyond 58.\n\nC)25<x<64 \u2192 Yes, because 28 is above 25, and 59.03 is below 64. So all x in 28 to 59.03 would be within 25-64.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check. The x starts at 28 and goes up to about 59. So the range is 28 to 59.03.\n\nWhich of the options includes this entire range?\n\nOption D says 28 <x <60. So that's correct because 59.03 is less than 60. So x is between 28 and 60, so 28 <x<60. That's option D.\n\nBut wait, let me recheck the calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in the substitution.\n\nWait, x =n -2\u221an +4. At n=36: 36 -12 +4=28. Correct.\n\nAt n=72: 72 -2*\u221a72 +4. \u221a72 is 6\u221a2. So 72+4=76. 2*6\u221a2=12\u221a2. So 76-12\u221a2. Let me compute 12*1.41421356237=16.970562748.\n\n76-16.970562748=59.029437252.\n\nSo about 59.03, yes. So the maximum is less than 60. So the range is 28 <x <\u224859.03, which is within 28<x<60. So option D is 28<x<60. So D is correct.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption C is 25<x<64. Our x starts at 28, which is above 25, and the maximum is about 59.03, which is below 64. So option C also includes the range, but D is more precise.\n\nBut wait, the question is which option is satisfied. So the x is between 28 and 59.03. So the correct option is the one that includes all x in that interval.\n\nOption D says 28 <x <60. That's correct because 59.03 is less than 60.\n\nOption C is 25<x<64. That's also correct because 28>25 and 59.03<64. So both options C and D include the entire x range. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake because in the problem statement, the question is whether x satisfies one of the options. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA)20 <x <54\n\nB)23 <x <58\n\nC)25 <x <64\n\nD)28 <x <60\n\nE)None of these.\n\nOur x is between 28 and approximately 59.03.\n\nSo let's see:\n\nOption D: 28 <x <60. So our x is within 28 to 59.03, so yes, it's within D.\n\nOption C: 25 <x <64. Our x is 28 to 59.03, which is within 25-64. So C is also correct.\n\nWait, but both C and D are correct? That can't be right. Because the options are mutually exclusive.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the simplification. Let me go back and check.\n\nWait, earlier steps: x = (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n+4) +16)/(n +4\u221an +4). We set a=\u221an, so n=a\u00b2.\n\nSo numerator: a^4 + 2a(a\u00b2 +4) +16 = a^4 + 2a^3 +8a +16.\n\nDenominator: a\u00b2 +4a +4 = (a+2)^2.\n\nThen numerator: a^4 + 2a^3 +8a +16. Let's factor this.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me try grouping terms again.\n\na^4 +2a^3 +8a +16. Let's group a^4 +2a^3 and 8a +16.\n\na^3(a+2) + 8(a +2) = (a^3 +8)(a+2).\n\nYes, that's correct. And a^3 +8 is (a+2)(a\u00b2 -2a +4), so numerator becomes (a+2)(a^2 -2a +4)(a+2) = (a+2)^2 (a^2 -2a +4).\n\nDenominator is (a+2)^2. So x = (a^2 -2a +4) = n -2\u221an +4. That's correct.\n\nSo, x =n -2\u221an +4.\n\nAt n=36, x=36 - 12 +4=28.\n\nAt n=72, x=72 -2*\u221a72 +4=72+4 - 2*6\u221a2=76 -12\u221a2.\n\nCompute 12\u221a2: 12*1.41421356237=16.970562748. So 76 -16.970562748=59.029437252.\n\nSo x is between 28 and approximately 59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D says 28<x<60. So 59.03 is less than 60, so yes, x is within 28 to 60. So D is correct.\n\nOption C says 25<x<64. 28 is above 25, and 59.03 is below 64. So C is also correct.\n\nWait, but both can't be correct. Hmm. Let me check if the question allows x to reach exactly 28 or 60.\n\nWait, n starts at 36, which is included. So x=28 is included. Similarly, n=72 gives x=76 -12\u221a2\u224859.03. So x can be up to about 59.03, which is less than 60. So in option D, the upper limit is 60, so 59.03 is less than 60, so x <60 holds.\n\nBut option C's upper limit is 64, which is higher than 59.03, so x <64 holds as well.\n\nSo both options C and D include the x range. But the options are A to E, and only one is correct.\n\nHmm, but the question is phrased as \"satisfies\" the given condition. So perhaps the correct answer is the tightest bound that includes all x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the simplification. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the original expression can be simplified differently. Let me try another approach.\n\nLooking at the numerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16.\n\nLet me think about the numerator as a perfect square. Let's see if it can be written as (something)^2.\n\nSuppose the numerator is (n + a\u221an + b)^2.\n\nExpanding that would give n\u00b2 + 2a n^{3/2} + (a\u00b2 + 2b) n + 2ab \u221an + b\u00b2.\n\nComparing with the given numerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the numerator is (\u221an + something)^2.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me try to write the numerator as (n + k\u221an + m)^2, and see if it matches.\n\nExpanding (n +k\u221an + m)^2 = n\u00b2 + 2k n^{3/2} + (k\u00b2 + 2m) n + 2k m \u221an + m\u00b2.\n\nComparing with the numerator n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16.\n\nWait, the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16.\n\nLet me expand that: n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an + 8\u221an +16.\n\nSo the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an +8\u221an +16.\n\nSo when I compare with the expansion (n +k\u221an +m)^2, I have:\n\nn\u00b2 + 2k n^{3/2} + (k\u00b2 + 2m) n + 2k m \u221an + m\u00b2.\n\nWhich must equal to n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an +8\u221an +16.\n\nSo, let's match coefficients:\n\n1. Coefficient of n\u00b2: 1 on both sides. Good.\n\n2. Coefficient of n^{3/2}: 2k = 2n? Wait, wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. Wait, the term in the numerator is 2n\u221an = 2n^{3/2}.\n\nWait, in the expansion, the term is 2k n^{3/2}.\n\nSo 2k n^{3/2} must equal 2n^{3/2} \u2192 2k =2 \u2192 k=1.\n\n3. Next, the term in n: (k\u00b2 + 2m) n. The numerator has 0n (because the numerator's expansion is n\u00b2 + 2n^{3/2} +8\u221an +16). So (k\u00b2 +2m) must be 0.\n\nSince k=1, 1 + 2m =0 \u2192 m= -0.5.\n\n4. Next, the term in \u221an: 2k m \u221an. Substituting k=1 and m=-0.5: 2*1*(-0.5)= -1. So the term is -\u221an. But the numerator has +8\u221an. So that's a problem.\n\nHmm, that's not matching. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the numerator is (\u221an + a)^2 + something.\n\nWait, perhaps another way to factor. Let me try to factor the numerator.\n\nWait, another way: numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16.\n\nWait, that's n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an + 8\u221an +16.\n\nHmm, perhaps grouping terms:\n\nn\u00b2 + 2n\u221an + (8\u221an +16).\n\nWait, maybe the first three terms form a square: (n +\u221an)^2 =n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an +n.\n\nSo n\u00b2 +2n\u221an = (n +\u221an)^2 -n.\n\nSo the numerator is (n +\u221an)^2 -n +8\u221an +16.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numerator is (n + a\u221an + b)^2 + c.\n\nBut perhaps this isn't the most efficient way. Let me go back to the initial approach where x simplifies to n -2\u221an +4, which gives x between 28 and approximately 59.03.\n\nSo which option is correct? Let me check the options again.\n\nOption D is 28 < x <60. Since x can be up to about 59.03, which is less than 60, this holds.\n\nOption C is 25 <x<64. Since 28>25 and 59.03<64, this also holds.\n\nWait, but the question is asking which option is correct. So both C and D include the correct range, but perhaps I made a mistake in my simplification.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial simplification was incorrect. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, when I set a=\u221an, the numerator became a^4 +2a^3 +8a +16.\n\nI thought this factors into (a^3 +8)(a+2), but wait: (a^3 +8) is (a+2)(a\u00b2 -2a +4), so (a+2)(a\u00b2-2a+4) * (a+2) = (a+2)^2 (a\u00b2-2a+4).\n\nWait, but wait, when I multiply (a+2)^2 and (a\u00b2-2a+4), does that give a^4 +2a^3 +8a +16?\n\nLet me compute (a+2)^2 (a\u00b2-2a+4).\n\nFirst, (a+2)^2 = a\u00b2 +4a +4.\n\nMultiply by (a\u00b2 -2a +4):\n\n= (a\u00b2 +4a +4)(a\u00b2 -2a +4)\n\nLet me expand this:\n\na\u00b2*(a\u00b2 -2a +4) = a^4 -2a^3 +4a^2.\n\n4a*(a\u00b2 -2a +4) =4a^3 -8a^2 +16a.\n\n4*(a\u00b2 -2a +4)=4a^2 -8a +16.\n\nNow, add them together:\n\na^4 -2a^3 +4a^2 +4a^3 -8a^2 +16a +4a^2 -8a +16.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\na^4 + ( -2a^3 +4a^3 ) + (4a^2 -8a^2 +4a^2 ) + (16a -8a) +16.\n\nSo:\n\na^4 +2a^3 +0a^2 +8a +16.\n\nWhich matches the numerator a^4 +2a^3 +8a +16. So the factorization is correct.\n\nSo the simplification is correct, x =a^2 -2a +4 =n -2\u221an +4.\n\nSo at n=36, x=36-12+4=28.\n\nAt n=72, x=72 -2*\u221a72 +4=76-12\u221a2\u224859.03.\n\nSo the range of x is (28,59.03).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA)20 <x<54 \u2192 No, since x can go up to 59.\n\nB)23<x<58 \u2192 No, since x can be up to ~59.03, which is above 58.\n\nC)25<x<64 \u2192 Yes, because 28>25 and 59.03<64.\n\nD)28<x<60 \u2192 Yes, because 28 is the lower bound, and 59.03<60.\n\nE)None of these.\n\nSo both C and D include the correct range. But looking at the options, perhaps D is more precise because it starts exactly at 28, which is the minimum x, and goes up to 60, which is just above the maximum x.\n\nBut the question is which option is correct. Let me see the options again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"satisfies\". So if the correct range is 28 <x <59.03, then both options C and D include this range. But the problem expects only one correct option.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of x at n=72.\n\nLet me compute x at n=72 again.\n\nn=72, \u221an=\u221a72=6\u221a2\u22488.485281374.\n\nSo x=72 -2*(6\u221a2) +4.\n\n72+4=76.\n\n2*(6\u221a2)=12\u221a2\u224816.970562748.\n\n76-16.970562748\u224859.029437252.\n\nSo x\u224859.03.\n\nSo x is approximately 59.03, which is less than 60. So the upper limit is under 60, so option D says x<60, which holds.\n\nOption C says x<64, which also holds.\n\nSo the range of x is between 28 and approximately 59.03.\n\nSo which option correctly represents this?\n\nOption D is 28<x<60, which is correct.\n\nOption C is 25<x<64, which is also correct.\n\nHmm, but the options are supposed to be exclusive, so perhaps the correct answer is E) None of these.\n\nWait, but why? Because both C and D include the correct range, but the problem expects one correct option.\n\nWait, perhaps the x doesn't actually reach 28. Because when n=36, is that included?\n\nWait, the question says 36 \u2264n \u226472. So n can be 36, which gives x=28.\n\nSo x can be 28. So the correct range is 28 \u2264x \u226459.03.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them include 28 as a lower bound. Let's see:\n\nOption D is 28 <x <60. So it's a strict inequality, meaning x can't be 28. But x can be 28 when n=36. So that would make option D incorrect because x can equal 28.\n\nWait, but the original expression for x: x = (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16)/(n +4\u221an +4).\n\nAt n=36, the denominator is 36 +4*6 +4=36+24+4=64.\n\nNumerator is 36\u00b2 +2*6*(36+4)+16=1296 +2*6*40 +16=1296+480+16=1792.\n\nSo x=1792 /64 =28.\n\nSo x=28 is possible. So the correct range is 28 \u2264x \u226459.03.\n\nBut the options are all open intervals, not including the endpoints.\n\nSo none of the options A to D include x=28. Let me look again:\n\nOption D says 28 <x <60. So x can't be 28. But in reality, x can be 28 when n=36. So the correct range includes 28, but option D says x>28, so it's incorrect.\n\nSimilarly, option C says x>25, which is true since the minimum is 28. So x is always above 25, but the lower limit is 28, which is included.\n\nBut the options don't have an option that includes x=28. So perhaps the correct answer is E) None of these.\n\nWait, but let's think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are written as open intervals, but the actual x can reach up to 59.03, which is less than 60. So for option D, 28 <x <60 is true because x starts at 28 (inclusive) and goes up to 59.03, which is less than 60.\n\nBut since the option is 28 <x <60, which is an open interval, but x can be 28, then the correct x range includes 28, but the option D doesn't include it. So the option D is not fully correct.\n\nSimilarly, option C's lower bound is 25, which is below 28, so it's acceptable, but the upper limit is 64, which is higher than 59.03. So x is always less than 64, so option C is correct.\n\nWait, but since the x can reach 28, which is within option C's range (25<x<64), then x satisfies option C. Because 28 is greater than 25 and 59.03 is less than 64.\n\nBut wait, in reality, x can be as low as 28, which is higher than 25. So option C is correct.\n\nWait, but why did I think earlier that option D was correct?\n\nBecause when I computed x at n=36, I get x=28, which is the minimum value. But option D says x>28, which is not true because x can be 28.\n\nSo in that case, option D is incorrect because x can be exactly 28, which is not included in option D.\n\nSo the correct option would be C, because 25 <x <64 includes all x from 28 up to ~59, which is less than 64.\n\nBut wait, looking again: the x is between 28 and ~59.03, inclusive.\n\nSo for option C: 25 <x <64. Since 28>25 and 59.03<64, any x in 28 to 59.03 would satisfy 25<x<64.\n\nThus, option C is correct.\n\nBut wait, the problem says 36 \u2264n \u226472. So n=36 gives x=28, which is included, and n=72 gives x\u224859.03, which is less than 60.\n\nSo the x range is 28 \u2264x \u226459.03.\n\nLooking at the options, which one is satisfied?\n\nOption C: 25 <x <64 \u2192 x can be 28, which is >25, and up to 59.03 <64 \u2192 yes.\n\nOption D: 28 <x <60 \u2192 x can be 28 (n=36) which is not included in D. So D is incorrect.\n\nThus, the correct answer is C.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought x can't be exactly 28 because the option is open. But wait, the problem says \"satisfies\", which could mean that x is within the open interval.\n\nWait, but the actual x can reach 28 and 59.03. So for the options, which are open, the correct option would have to include these endpoints within the open interval.\n\nWait, but 28 is the minimum x, and option D starts at 28, but it's an open interval, so x must be greater than 28. But x can be exactly 28, so option D is incorrect.\n\nOption C: 25 <x <64 \u2192 28 is greater than 25, and 59.03 is less than 64. So for all x in our range, x is within C's range.\n\nThus, the correct option is C.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that D was correct. I'm getting a bit confused. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, when n=36, x=28 is included. So any option that includes x=28 must have 28 as the lower bound.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C: 25 <x <64 \u2192 28 is within this range.\n\nOption D:28 <x <60 \u2192 x=28 is not included, so this option is incorrect.\n\nSo the correct answer is C.\n\nWait, but the initial calculation suggested that the maximum x is ~59.03, which is under 60, so option D's upper limit is 60, which would include all x up to that.\n\nBut since the lower limit of D is 28 (exclusive), and x can be 28, D is not correct.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C.\n\nWait, but the problem's options don't have an option that includes x=28 in the lower bound. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider whether x can be exactly 28.\n\nYes, when n=36, x=28.\n\nBut the options are open intervals, so none of the options include x=28. So perhaps the correct answer is E) None of these.\n\nWait, because all the options A to D are open intervals, and x can be exactly 28, which is not included in any of the options except maybe C, but C's lower limit is 25, which is less than 28. So x=28 is within C's interval, but the problem is whether x can be exactly 28, which is possible.\n\nWait, but if the options are open intervals, then x=28 is not included in option C's interval (25 <x <64), because 28 is greater than 25, so 28 is within 25 <x <64. So option C is correct.\n\nBut wait, no. Open intervals don't include the endpoints. So 25 <x <64 means x is greater than 25 and less than 64. So x=28 is included because 28>25.\n\nSimilarly, x=59.03 is less than 64, so it's included.\n\nSo the correct answer is C.\n\nBut earlier I thought D was correct, but that's because I thought x starts at 28, but in reality, since x can be 28, which is included in C's interval.\n\nHmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to approach this differently.\n\nThe x simplifies to x =n -2\u221an +4.\n\nWe can compute x at n=36 and n=72.\n\nx=28 at n=36.\n\nx\u224859.03 at n=72.\n\nSo the range of x is [28, ~59.03].\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 x can be up to 59.03, which is beyond 54. So A is incorrect.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 x can be up to 59.03, which is beyond 58. So B is incorrect.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 28 is >25, and 59.03 <64. So C is correct.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 x can be 28, which is not included in D. So D is incorrect.\n\nThus, the correct answer is C.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that 36 \u2264n \u226472. So n can be 36, which makes x=28. So x can be 28. So for option C, x=28 is within 25 <x <64, so C is correct.\n\nBut earlier I thought option D was correct because I didn't consider that x can be exactly 28. But since option D starts at 28 (exclusive), it's incorrect.\n\nSo the correct answer is C.\n\n\nThe problem involves simplifying the expression for \\( x \\) and determining its range when \\( n \\) is in the interval \\( 36 \\leq n \\leq 72 \\). The expression for \\( x \\) is given as:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{n^2 + 2\\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16}{n + 4\\sqrt{n} + 4}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Expression\nLet \\( a = \\sqrt{n} \\), so \\( n = a^2 \\). Substituting into the numerator and denominator:\n\n- **Numerator**: \\( n^2 + 2\\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 = a^4 + 2a^3 + 8a + 16 \\).\n- **Denominator**: \\( n + 4\\sqrt{n} + 4 = a^2 + 4a + 4 = (a + 2)^2 \\).\n\nFactoring the numerator:\n\n\\[\na^4 + 2a^3 + 8a + 16 = (a + 2)^2(a^2 - 2a + 4).\n\\]\n\nThus, the expression simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{(a + 2)^2(a^2 - 2a + 4)}{(a + 2)^2} = a^2 - 2a + 4.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting back \\( a = \\sqrt{n} \\), we get:\n\n\\[\nx = n - 2\\sqrt{n} + 4.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Range of \\( x \\)\nGiven \\( 36 \\leq n \\leq 72 \\), we compute \\( x \\) at the endpoints:\n\n1. **At \\( n = 36 \\):**\n   \\[\n   x = 36 - 2\\sqrt{36} + 4 = 36 - 12 + 4 = 28.\n   \\]\n\n2. **At \\( n = 72 \\):**\n   \\[\n   x = 72 - 2\\sqrt{72} + 4 = 72 - 2(6\\sqrt{2}) + 4 = 76 - 12\\sqrt{2}.\n   \\]\n   Approximating \\( \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414 \\), we find:\n   \\[\n   x \\approx 76 - 12(1.414) = 76 - 16.97 = 59.03.\n   \\]\n\nThus, \\( x \\) ranges from \\( 28 \\) to approximately \\( 59.03 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Options\nThe options are:\n\n- **A)** \\( 20 < x < 54 \\): Incorrect, as \\( x \\) can exceed \\( 54 \\) (e.g., \\( x \\approx 59.03 \\)).\n- **B)** \\( 23 < x < 58 \\): Incorrect, as \\( x \\) can exceed \\( 58 \\) (e.g., \\( x \\approx 59.03 \\)).\n- **C)** \\( 25 < x < 64 \\): Correct, as \\( 28 \\leq x \\leq 59.03 \\) is entirely within this range.\n- **D)** \\( 28 < x < 60 \\): Incorrect, as \\( x = 28 \\) is included in the range but not in this open interval.\n- **E)** None of these: Incorrect, as option C is valid.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe correct option is **C**, as it fully encompasses the range of \\( x \\). \n\nANSWER: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the value of x given a certain expression, and n is between 36 and 72. The options are ranges for x, so I guess I need to figure out what x is in terms of n and then see which range it falls into.\n\nThe expression for x is (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n + 4) + 16) divided by (n + 4\u221an +4). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it. Let me write it out:\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16] / [n +4\u221an +4]\n\nWait, maybe the numerator and denominator can be factored or rewritten somehow. Let me look closer.\n\nThe numerator has n\u00b2, 2\u221an(n+4), and 16. The denominator has n, 4\u221an, and 4. Hmm, perhaps there's a way to factor both numerator and denominator.\n\nLet me think about the numerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. That looks kind of like a quadratic in terms of something. Oh wait, maybe I can treat \u221an as a variable. Let's say a = \u221an. Then n = a\u00b2, and \u221an = a.\n\nSubstituting into the numerator: a^4 + 2a(a\u00b2 +4) +16. Let's expand that. a^4 + 2a^3 + 8a +16. Hmm, not sure if that helps much.\n\nWait, perhaps the numerator is a perfect square. Let me see. Let's suppose it's (something)^2. Let's try (a\u00b2 + b)^2, which would expand to a^4 + 2a\u00b2b + b\u00b2. But our numerator is a^4 + 2a^3 +8a +16. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a square of a binomial involving a and something else. Let me think: Maybe (a\u00b2 + ka + m)^2? Let's try expanding that. (a\u00b2 + ka + m)^2 = a^4 + 2ka^3 + (k\u00b2 + 2m)a\u00b2 + 2k m a + m\u00b2. Comparing to the numerator, which is a^4 + 2a^3 + 8a +16. So:\n\nLooking at the coefficients:\n\n- 2ka^3: So 2k = 2 \u2192 k=1.\n- Then (k\u00b2 + 2m)a\u00b2: since k=1, that's (1 + 2m)a\u00b2. But in the numerator, the a\u00b2 term is zero. So 1 + 2m =0 \u2192 m= -0.5.\n- Then 2k m a: 2*(1)*(-0.5) a = -a. But in the numerator, the a term is +8a. Hmm, doesn't match. So maybe not a perfect square.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numerator isn't a perfect square but can be factored another way. Alternatively, maybe the denominator can be rewritten in terms of a. The denominator is n +4\u221an +4, which with a substitution is a\u00b2 +4a +4. Oh wait! That looks familiar. a\u00b2 +4a +4 is (a+2)^2. So denominator is (a + 2)^2.\n\nSo denominator is (a + 2)^2, where a=\u221an.\n\nWhat about the numerator? Let's go back. The numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16. Let's express everything in terms of a.\n\nn = a\u00b2, so n\u00b2 = (a\u00b2)^2 = a^4. \u221an = a, so 2\u221an(n+4) = 2a(a\u00b2 +4) = 2a^3 + 8a. 16 is 16.\n\nSo numerator becomes a^4 + 2a^3 +8a +16. Hmm. Let me see if I can factor this.\n\nLooking for possible factors: Maybe group terms. Let's group a^4 +2a^3 and 8a +16.\n\na^4 +2a^3 = a^3(a + 2)\n8a +16 = 8(a +2)\n\nSo the numerator is a^3(a +2) +8(a +2) = (a +2)(a^3 +8).\n\nWait, a^3 +8 is a sum of cubes: a^3 + 2^3 = (a +2)(a\u00b2 -2a +4).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nNumerator = (a +2)(a^3 +8) = (a +2)(a +2)(a\u00b2 -2a +4) = (a+2)^2 (a\u00b2 -2a +4).\n\nDenominator is (a +2)^2.\n\nSo x = [ (a+2)^2 (a\u00b2 - 2a +4) ] / (a+2)^2 )\n\nThe (a+2)^2 terms cancel out, so x = a\u00b2 - 2a +4.\n\nBut a is \u221an. So x = (\u221an)^2 - 2\u221an +4. Which simplifies to n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nWait, wait. Because (\u221an)^2 is n, right? So x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nHmm, that's a much simpler expression. So x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nNow, I need to find the range of x when n is between 36 and 72.\n\nSo let's compute x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nGiven that n ranges from 36 to 72, I can find the minimum and maximum values of x.\n\nFirst, let's compute x at n=36:\n\nx =36 - 2*sqrt(36) +4 = 36 -2*6 +4 =36-12+4=28.\n\nAt n=72:\n\nx=72 - 2*sqrt(72) +4. Let's compute sqrt(72). sqrt(72)=sqrt(36*2)=6*sqrt(2)=approx 6*1.4142=8.4852.\n\nSo 2*sqrt(72)= ~16.9704.\n\nSo x=72 +4 -16.9704=76 -16.9704\u224859.0296.\n\nWait, but wait, that's the value at n=72, which is about 59.03.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to about 59.03.\n\nBut wait, we need to make sure whether x is increasing or decreasing in this interval. Let's see.\n\nx = n - 2\u221an +4. Let's think of x as a function of n. Let's find its derivative to see if it's increasing or decreasing.\n\ndx/dn = 1 - (2*(1/(2\u221an))) )= 1 - (1/\u221an).\n\nSo dx/dn = ( \u221an - 1 ) / \u221an.\n\nSince n \u226536, \u221an is at least 6. So \u221an -1 \u22655. So dx/dn is positive for all n \u226536. So x is an increasing function of n in this interval.\n\nThus, when n increases, x increases.\n\nSo the minimum x is at n=36, which is 28, and maximum at n=72 is approximately 59.03.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to about 59.03.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA) 20 < x <54 \u2192 28 is higher than 20, and 59 is higher than 54, so this doesn't include all x.\n\nB) 23 <x<58 \u2192 59 is above 58, so some x would be above 58, so this range doesn't cover all possibilities.\n\nC)25 <x<64 \u2192 28 is above 25, and 59 is below 64. So all x are within this range.\n\nWait, wait, but x can be as low as 28, which is higher than 25, and as high as ~59, which is lower than 64. So x is between 28 and ~59, which is entirely within 25 and 64. So option C says 25 <x<64, which would include all x in our range.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option D is 28 <x<60.\n\nOur x ranges from 28 to ~59.03, which is within 28 to 60. So option D would also include all x in this case.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When n=72, x is approximately 59.03, which is just over 59. So the maximum x is around 59.03, which is just above 59.\n\nSo the upper limit is just over 59. So the range is 28 to approximately 59.03.\n\nSo looking at the options:\n\nOption D says 28 <x<60. So 59.03 is just under 60, so x is always less than 60. So the maximum x is less than 60. So x is between 28 and about 59.03.\n\nSo the correct range would be 28 <x<60.\n\nWhich is option D.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the computation for n=72.\n\nsqrt(72)=6*sqrt(2)= approx 8.48528.\n\nSo 2*sqrt(72)=16.97056.\n\nSo x=72 -16.97056 +4= (72+4) -16.97056=76-16.97056=59.02944. So approximately 59.03.\n\nSo the maximum x is about 59.03, which is just below 60.\n\nSo the correct range is x is greater than 28 and less than about 59.03, which is entirely within 28 <x<60.\n\nSo the answer should be option D.\n\nWait, but wait the options:\n\nOption C is 25 <x<64 \u2192 our x starts at 28, which is higher than 25, so the lower bound is 28, which is higher than 25. So the entire x range is within option C's range as well. But option D is a tighter upper bound.\n\nWait, the question says \"satisfies\", so which of the options is correct. So if the actual x is between 28 and ~59, then which option covers this?\n\nOption D says 28 <x<60. So all x satisfy this because 28 <x and x <60.\n\nOption C says 25 <x<64. So all x are also within this, but the options are multiple-choice, and only one is correct.\n\nSo which option is correct? Let me re-examine the options:\n\nA) 20 <x <54 \u2192 59>54, so not correct.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u219259>58, so some x's are beyond this.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 all x are in this, since x ranges 28-59.03.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 all x are in this, since 28 is the lower end, and 59.03 <60.\n\nSo both options C and D cover the x range. Wait, but the question is which option is correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution earlier. Let me recheck the expression for x.\n\nWait, x = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16]/(n +4\u221an +4). I substituted a =\u221an, then the denominator became (a+2)^2.\n\nThe numerator: n\u00b2 +2\u221an(n+4) +16.\n\nWait, n\u00b2 is a^4, 2\u221an(n+4)=2a(a\u00b2 +4)=2a^3 +8a, and 16 is 16.\n\nSo numerator is a^4 +2a^3 +8a +16.\n\nThen I tried to factor this. I thought of grouping a^4 +2a^3 and 8a+16.\n\na^3(a+2) +8(a+2) = (a+2)(a^3 +8).\n\nWait, a^3 +8 is a sum of cubes, which is (a+2)(a\u00b2 -2a +4). So numerator becomes (a+2)(a+2)(a\u00b2 -2a +4) = (a+2)^2 (a\u00b2 -2a +4).\n\nDenominator is (a+2)^2, so x is (a+2)^2 (a\u00b2 -2a +4) divided by (a+2)^2 \u2192 x = a\u00b2 -2a +4.\n\nWhich is n -2\u221an +4. Because a=\u221an, so a\u00b2 =n.\n\nSo x =n -2\u221an +4. That seems correct.\n\nThen, when n=36, x=36-12+4=28.\n\nn=72, x=72 - 2*sqrt(72)+4.\n\nsqrt(72)=6*sqrt(2)=approx 8.485. 2* that is ~16.97.\n\nSo 72 +4=76, minus 16.97 is 59.03.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to 59.03.\n\nSo x is between 28 and about 59.03.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption D:28 <x<60 \u2192 28 is the minimum, and 60 is above the maximum. So all x satisfy this.\n\nOption C:25 <x <64 \u2192 includes x from 25 to 64. Since x starts at 28, all x are within C.\n\nBut the question is which option is correct. Are both C and D correct? No, because the question asks which option is correct, implying only one is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the simplification. Let me recheck the initial expression.\n\nWait, the initial expression is (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16)/(n +4\u221an +4).\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in factoring the numerator.\n\nWait, let me re-express the numerator again.\n\nn\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write this as (\u221an + something)^2. Let me try.\n\nLet me think: Let me suppose it's (\u221an + a)^2. Expanding, it's n + 2a\u221an + a\u00b2. But our numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16.\n\nWait, that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe it's (n + b\u221an + c)^2. Let me try expanding that.\n\n(n + b\u221an + c)^2 = n\u00b2 + 2b n^(3/2) + (b\u00b2 + 2c) n + 2bc \u221an + c\u00b2.\n\nComparing to the numerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator as (n + something)(something else).\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the numerator as n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n+4) +16.\n\nLet me write it as n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n) + 2\u221an (4) +16.\n\nWhich is n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16.\n\nHmm, perhaps this can be written as (n + something)^2.\n\nLet me try (n + a\u221an + b)^2.\n\nExpanding, n\u00b2 + 2a n^(3/2) + (a\u00b2 + 2b) n + 2ab \u221an + b\u00b2.\n\nComparing to the numerator, n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16.\n\nSo, let's set up equations:\n\nCoefficient of n^(3/2) : 2a = 2 \u2192 a=1.\n\nCoefficient of \u221an: 2ab =8 \u2192 2*1*b=8 \u2192 b=4.\n\nNow, check the other terms. The coefficient of n is (a\u00b2 + 2b) = 1 + 8=9. But in the numerator, the coefficient of n is zero. So that's a problem. Because in the numerator, we have n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16 \u2192 the n term is zero.\n\nSo the expansion would have (n + \u221an +4)^2 = n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) + (1 + 8) n + 8\u221an + 16. So the coefficient of n is 9, which doesn't match the numerator. So this approach isn't working.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should go back to the earlier conclusion that x = n - 2\u221an +4, and that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I can test with a value of n to see if that works. Let's pick n=16, which is less than 36 but just to test.\n\nCompute x using original expression and the simplified x.\n\nOriginal x for n=16: numerator is 16\u00b2 +2\u221a16*(16+4) +16 = 256 + 2*4*(20) +16 =256 + 160 +16=432.\n\nDenominator:16 +4*sqrt(16) +4=16 +16 +4=36. So x=432/36=12.\n\nSimplified x: n-2\u221an +4=16-8+4=12. Correct.\n\nAnother test: n=25. sqrt(25)=5.\n\nOriginal x: numerator=25\u00b2 +2*5*(25+4)+16=625 + 2*5*29 +16=625 +290 +16=931.\n\nDenominator=25 +4*5 +4=25+20+4=49. So x=931/49=19.\n\nSimplified x:25-10+4=19. Correct.\n\nSo the simplification is correct.\n\nSo the expression x =n -2\u221an +4 is correct.\n\nSo for n=36, x=28.\n\nn=72: x\u224859.03.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to ~59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 59>54, so no.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u219259>58, so some x are beyond.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 28>25, 59<64 \u2192 all x in this range.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 28 is the minimum, 59.03<60 \u2192 all x in this range.\n\nE) None of these.\n\nSo both options C and D include the entire x range. But wait, the question is asking which option x satisfies. So if both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is E) None of these.\n\nWait, but no. Because the question is, which option x satisfies the condition. So if x is between 28 and 59, then any option that includes that range is correct. But both C and D include that range. So which is correct?\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 incorrect, because x can be up to ~59.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 incorrect, because x can be up to ~59.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 correct, since x is between 28 and 59, which is within 25 and 64.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 also correct, since x is between 28 and 59.03, which is within 28 and 60.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the options are mutually exclusive, and only one is correct. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me re-express x. x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nWait, perhaps x can be rewritten as (sqrt(n) - 1)^2 +3. Let's see:\n\n(sqrt(n) -1)^2 =n -2\u221an +1.\n\nSo x =n-2\u221an +4= (n-2\u221an +1) +3 = (sqrt(n)-1)^2 +3.\n\nSo x is (sqrt(n)-1)^2 +3. Since (sqrt(n)-1)^2 is always non-negative, the minimum x occurs when (sqrt(n)-1)^2 is as small as possible.\n\nWhat's the minimum value of (sqrt(n)-1)^2?\n\nIt's zero when sqrt(n) =1 \u2192 n=1. But n is between 36 and 72, so sqrt(n) is between 6 and ~8.485.\n\nSo (sqrt(n)-1)^2 is positive in this range.\n\nThe minimum value of x occurs when (sqrt(n)-1)^2 is minimized.\n\nThe minimum of (sqrt(n)-1)^2 is when sqrt(n) is as close to 1 as possible. But in our case, sqrt(n) is at least 6. So the minimum (sqrt(n)-1)^2 is when sqrt(n)=6, which is (6-1)^2=25.\n\nSo x_min =25 +3=28, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSimilarly, when sqrt(n) is maximum (sqrt(72)=~8.485), (8.485-1)^2 = (7.485)^2\u224856.03. So x=56.03 +3\u224859.03.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to about 59.03.\n\nNow, looking at the options again:\n\nOption D:28 <x <60 \u2192 correct, since x is up to ~59.03, which is less than 60.\n\nOption C:25 <x <64 \u2192 correct, as x is from 28 to ~59.03, which is within 25 and 64.\n\nSo both options C and D are correct? But that can't be, as the options are single-choice.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is to find which option x satisfies the condition for all n in 36\u2264n\u226472. So for all n in that range, x is in the specified interval.\n\nSo, for example, if the question is \"x is between which of the following intervals for all n in 36\u2264n\u226472\", then the correct option must fully encompass all possible x.\n\nIn that case, both C and D encompass the x range. But looking at the options, perhaps the tightest correct option is D, since it's more precise.\n\nWait, but the options are A to E, with E being none of these. But since both C and D are correct, perhaps the intended answer is D, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in the way x is simplified.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me compute x for n=36 and n=72 and see which options include these values.\n\nn=36: x=28. So x=28 is the minimum.\n\nn=72: x\u224859.03.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to about 59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C:25 <x <64 \u2192 includes 28 to 59.03.\n\nOption D:28 <x <60 \u2192 includes 28 to 59.03, since 59.03<60.\n\nSo both options C and D include the entire x range. But the problem is to choose the correct option, which is one of them.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct option is the one that exactly covers the x range, but that's not the case. So perhaps I need to look for which option is correct.\n\nWait, the problem states that x satisfies the condition for n in 36\u2264n\u226472. So for all n in that range, x must lie within the given option's range.\n\nSo for option D, 28 <x <60. At n=36, x=28, which is not less than 28, so x=28 is the minimum. So the condition 28 <x would exclude n=36. But the question is whether x satisfies the condition for n in 36\u2264n\u226472, so x can be equal to 28.\n\nWait, the options are written as inequalities with strict less than. So option D says 28 <x <60. But when n=36, x=28, which is not greater than 28, so it doesn't satisfy option D. Similarly, when n=36, x=28, which is not greater than 28, so it doesn't satisfy option D. So option D is incorrect because at n=36, x=28 which is not greater than 28.\n\nWait, but wait, the options are written as \"satisfies\" meaning for all n in the range, x must lie within the option's range. So if for any n in the range, x doesn't satisfy the option's condition, that option is incorrect.\n\nSo for option D, when n=36, x=28, which is not greater than 28, so D is incorrect.\n\nSimilarly, option C says 25 <x <64. At n=36, x=28>25, so that's okay. At n=72, x\u224859.03<64, so that's okay. So option C is correct because for all n in 36\u2264n\u226472, x is between 28 and 59.03, which is within 25 and 64.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that option D was correct, but upon reevaluating the inequalities, since option D requires x>28, which isn't true when n=36, option D is incorrect.\n\nSo the correct option is C:25 <x <64.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the value of x given a certain expression, and n is between 36 and 72. The options are ranges for x, so I guess I need to figure out what x is in terms of n and then see which range it falls into.\n\nThe expression for x is (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n + 4) + 16) divided by (n + 4\u221an +4). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it. Let me write it out:\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16] / [n +4\u221an +4]\n\nWait, maybe the numerator and denominator can be factored or rewritten somehow. Let me look closer.\n\nThe numerator has n\u00b2, 2\u221an(n+4), and 16. The denominator has n, 4\u221an, and 4. Hmm, perhaps there's a way to factor both numerator and denominator.\n\nLet me think about the numerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. That looks kind of like a quadratic in terms of something. Oh wait, maybe I can treat \u221an as a variable. Let's say a = \u221an. Then n = a\u00b2, and \u221an = a.\n\nSubstituting into the numerator: a^4 + 2a(a\u00b2 +4) +16. Let's expand that. a^4 + 2a^3 + 8a +16. Hmm, not sure if that helps much.\n\nWait, perhaps the numerator is a perfect square. Let me see. Let's suppose it's (something)^2. Let's try (a\u00b2 + b)^2, which would expand to a^4 + 2a\u00b2b + b\u00b2. But our numerator is a^4 + 2a^3 +8a +16. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a square of a binomial involving a and something else. Let me think: Maybe (a\u00b2 + ka + m)^2? Let's try expanding that. (a\u00b2 + ka + m)^2 = a^4 + 2ka^3 + (k\u00b2 + 2m)a\u00b2 + 2k m a + m\u00b2. Comparing to the numerator, which is a^4 + 2a^3 + 8a +16. So:\n\nLooking at the coefficients:\n\n- 2ka^3: So 2k = 2 \u2192 k=1.\n- Then (k\u00b2 + 2m)a\u00b2: since k=1, that's (1 + 2m)a\u00b2. But in the numerator, the a\u00b2 term is zero. So 1 + 2m =0 \u2192 m= -0.5.\n- Then 2k m a: 2*(1)*(-0.5) a = -a. But in the numerator, the a term is +8a. Hmm, doesn't match. So maybe not a perfect square.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numerator isn't a perfect square but can be factored another way. Alternatively, maybe the denominator can be rewritten in terms of a. The denominator is n +4\u221an +4, which with a substitution is a\u00b2 +4a +4. Oh wait! That looks familiar. a\u00b2 +4a +4 is (a+2)^2. So denominator is (a + 2)^2.\n\nSo denominator is (a + 2)^2, where a=\u221an.\n\nWhat about the numerator? Let's go back. The numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16. Let's express everything in terms of a.\n\nn = a\u00b2, so n\u00b2 = (a\u00b2)^2 = a^4. \u221an = a, so 2\u221an(n+4) = 2a(a\u00b2 +4) = 2a^3 + 8a. 16 is 16.\n\nSo numerator becomes a^4 + 2a^3 +8a +16. Hmm. Let me see if I can factor this.\n\nLooking for possible factors: Maybe group terms. Let's group a^4 +2a^3 and 8a +16.\n\na^4 +2a^3 = a^3(a + 2)\n8a +16 = 8(a +2)\n\nSo the numerator is a^3(a +2) +8(a +2) = (a +2)(a^3 +8).\n\nWait, a^3 +8 is a sum of cubes: a^3 + 2^3 = (a +2)(a\u00b2 -2a +4).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nNumerator = (a +2)(a^3 +8) = (a +2)(a +2)(a\u00b2 -2a +4) = (a+2)^2 (a\u00b2 -2a +4).\n\nDenominator is (a +2)^2.\n\nSo x = [ (a+2)^2 (a\u00b2 - 2a +4) ] / (a+2)^2 )\n\nThe (a+2)^2 terms cancel out, so x = a\u00b2 - 2a +4.\n\nBut a is \u221an. So x = (\u221an)^2 - 2\u221an +4. Which simplifies to n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nWait, wait. Because (\u221an)^2 is n, right? So x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nHmm, that's a much simpler expression. So x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nNow, I need to find the range of x when n is between 36 and 72.\n\nSo let's compute x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nGiven that n ranges from 36 to 72, I can find the minimum and maximum values of x.\n\nFirst, let's compute x at n=36:\n\nx =36 - 2*sqrt(36) +4 = 36 -2*6 +4 =36-12+4=28.\n\nAt n=72:\n\nx=72 - 2*sqrt(72) +4. Let's compute sqrt(72). sqrt(72)=sqrt(36*2)=6*sqrt(2)=approx 6*1.4142=8.4852.\n\nSo 2*sqrt(72)= ~16.9704.\n\nSo x=72 +4 -16.9704=76 -16.9704\u224859.0296.\n\nWait, but wait, that's the value at n=72, which is about 59.03.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to about 59.03.\n\nBut wait, we need to make sure whether x is increasing or decreasing in this interval. Let's see.\n\nx = n - 2\u221an +4. Let's think of x as a function of n. Let's find its derivative to see if it's increasing or decreasing.\n\ndx/dn = 1 - (2*(1/(2\u221an))) )= 1 - (1/\u221an).\n\nSo dx/dn = ( \u221an - 1 ) / \u221an.\n\nSince n \u226536, \u221an is at least 6. So \u221an -1 \u22655. So dx/dn is positive for all n \u226536. So x is an increasing function of n in this interval.\n\nThus, when n increases, x increases.\n\nSo the minimum x is at n=36, which is 28, and maximum at n=72 is approximately 59.03.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to about 59.03.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA) 20 < x <54 \u2192 28 is higher than 20, and 59 is higher than 54, so this doesn't include all x.\n\nB) 23 <x<58 \u2192 59 is above 58, so some x would be above 58, so this range doesn't cover all possibilities.\n\nC)25 <x<64 \u2192 28 is above 25, and 59 is below 64. So all x are within this range.\n\nWait, wait, but x can be as low as 28, which is higher than 25, and as high as ~59, which is lower than 64. So x is between 28 and ~59, which is entirely within 25 and 64. So option C says 25 <x<64, which would include all x in our range.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option D is 28 <x<60.\n\nOur x ranges from 28 to ~59.03, which is within 28 to 60. So option D would also include all x in this case.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When n=72, x is approximately 59.03, which is just over 59. So the maximum x is around 59.03, which is just above 59.\n\nSo the upper limit is just over 59. So the range is 28 to approximately 59.03.\n\nSo looking at the options:\n\nOption D says 28 <x<60. So 59.03 is just under 60, so x is always less than 60. So the maximum x is less than 60. So x is between 28 and about 59.03.\n\nSo the correct range would be 28 <x<60.\n\nWhich is option D.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the computation for n=72.\n\nsqrt(72)=6*sqrt(2)= approx 8.48528.\n\nSo 2*sqrt(72)=16.97056.\n\nSo x=72 -16.97056 +4= (72+4) -16.97056=76-16.97056=59.02944. So approximately 59.03.\n\nSo the maximum x is about 59.03, which is just below 60.\n\nSo the correct range is x is greater than 28 and less than about 59.03, which is entirely within 28 <x<60.\n\nSo the answer should be option D.\n\nWait, but wait the options:\n\nOption C is 25 <x<64 \u2192 our x starts at 28, which is higher than 25, so the lower bound is 28, which is higher than 25. So the entire x range is within option C's range as well. But option D is a tighter upper bound.\n\nWait, the question says \"satisfies\", so which of the options is correct. So if the actual x is between 28 and ~59, then which option covers this?\n\nOption D says 28 <x<60. So all x satisfy this because 28 <x and x <60.\n\nOption C says 25 <x<64. So all x are also within this, but the options are multiple-choice, and only one is correct.\n\nSo which option is correct? Let me re-examine the options:\n\nA) 20 <x <54 \u2192 59>54, so not correct.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u219259>58, so some x's are beyond this.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 all x are in this, since x ranges 28-59.03.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 all x are in this, since 28 is the lower end, and 59.03 <60.\n\nSo both options C and D cover the x range. Wait, but the question is which option is correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution earlier. Let me recheck the expression for x.\n\nWait, x = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16]/(n +4\u221an +4). I substituted a =\u221an, then the denominator became (a+2)^2.\n\nThe numerator: n\u00b2 +2\u221an(n+4) +16.\n\nWait, n\u00b2 is a^4, 2\u221an(n+4)=2a(a\u00b2 +4)=2a^3 +8a, and 16 is 16.\n\nSo numerator is a^4 +2a^3 +8a +16.\n\nThen I tried to factor this. I thought of grouping a^4 +2a^3 and 8a+16.\n\na^3(a+2) +8(a+2) = (a+2)(a^3 +8).\n\nWait, a^3 +8 is a sum of cubes, which is (a+2)(a\u00b2 -2a +4). So numerator becomes (a+2)(a+2)(a\u00b2 -2a +4) = (a+2)^2 (a\u00b2 -2a +4).\n\nDenominator is (a+2)^2, so x is (a+2)^2 (a\u00b2 -2a +4) divided by (a+2)^2 \u2192 x = a\u00b2 -2a +4.\n\nWhich is n -2\u221an +4. Because a=\u221an, so a\u00b2 =n.\n\nSo x =n -2\u221an +4. That seems correct.\n\nThen, when n=36, x=36-12+4=28.\n\nn=72, x=72 - 2*sqrt(72)+4.\n\nsqrt(72)=6*sqrt(2)=approx 8.485. 2* that is ~16.97.\n\nSo 72 +4=76, minus 16.97 is 59.03.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to 59.03.\n\nSo x is between 28 and about 59.03.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption D:28 <x<60 \u2192 28 is the minimum, and 60 is above the maximum. So all x satisfy this.\n\nOption C:25 <x <64 \u2192 includes x from 25 to 64. Since x starts at 28, all x are within C.\n\nBut the question is which option is correct. Are both C and D correct? No, because the question asks which option is correct, implying only one is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the simplification. Let me recheck the initial expression.\n\nWait, the initial expression is (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16)/(n +4\u221an +4).\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in factoring the numerator.\n\nWait, let me re-express the numerator again.\n\nn\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write this as (\u221an + something)^2. Let me try.\n\nLet me think: Let me suppose it's (\u221an + a)^2. Expanding, it's n + 2a\u221an + a\u00b2. But our numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16.\n\nWait, that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe it's (n + b\u221an + c)^2. Let me try expanding that.\n\n(n + b\u221an + c)^2 = n\u00b2 + 2b n^(3/2) + (b\u00b2 + 2c) n + 2bc \u221an + c\u00b2.\n\nComparing to the numerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator as (n + something)(something else).\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the numerator as n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n+4) +16.\n\nLet me write it as n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n) + 2\u221an (4) +16.\n\nWhich is n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16.\n\nHmm, perhaps this can be written as (n + something)^2.\n\nLet me try (n + a\u221an + b)^2.\n\nExpanding, n\u00b2 + 2a n^(3/2) + (a\u00b2 + 2b) n + 2ab \u221an + b\u00b2.\n\nComparing to the numerator, n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16.\n\nSo, let's set up equations:\n\nCoefficient of n^(3/2) : 2a = 2 \u2192 a=1.\n\nCoefficient of \u221an: 2ab =8 \u2192 2*1*b=8 \u2192 b=4.\n\nNow, check the other terms. The coefficient of n is (a\u00b2 + 2b) = 1 + 8=9. But in the numerator, the coefficient of n is zero. So that's a problem. Because in the numerator, we have n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16 \u2192 the n term is zero.\n\nSo the expansion would have (n + \u221an +4)^2 = n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) + (1 + 8) n + 8\u221an + 16. So the coefficient of n is 9, which doesn't match the numerator. So this approach isn't working.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should go back to the earlier conclusion that x = n - 2\u221an +4, and that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I can test with a value of n to see if that works. Let's pick n=16, which is less than 36 but just to test.\n\nCompute x using original expression and the simplified x.\n\nOriginal x for n=16: numerator is 16\u00b2 +2\u221a16*(16+4) +16 = 256 + 2*4*(20) +16 =256 + 160 +16=432.\n\nDenominator:16 +4*sqrt(16) +4=16 +16 +4=36. So x=432/36=12.\n\nSimplified x: n-2\u221an +4=16-8+4=12. Correct.\n\nAnother test: n=25. sqrt(25)=5.\n\nOriginal x: numerator=25\u00b2 +2*5*(25+4)+16=625 + 2*5*29 +16=625 +290 +16=931.\n\nDenominator=25 +4*5 +4=25+20+4=49. So x=931/49=19.\n\nSimplified x:25-10+4=19. Correct.\n\nSo the simplification is correct.\n\nSo the expression x =n -2\u221an +4 is correct.\n\nSo for n=36, x=28.\n\nn=72: x\u224859.03.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to ~59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 59>54, so no.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u219259>58, so some x are beyond.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 28>25, 59<64 \u2192 all x in this range.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 28 is the minimum, 59.03<60 \u2192 all x in this range.\n\nE) None of these.\n\nSo both options C and D include the entire x range. But wait, the question is asking which option x satisfies. So if both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is E) None of these.\n\nWait, but no. Because the question is, which option x satisfies the condition. So if x is between 28 and 59, then any option that includes that range is correct. But both C and D include that range. So which is correct?\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 incorrect, because x can be up to ~59.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 incorrect, because x can be up to ~59.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 correct, since x is between 28 and 59, which is within 25 and 64.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 also correct, since x is between 28 and 59.03, which is within 28 and 60.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the options are mutually exclusive, and only one is correct. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me re-express x. x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nWait, perhaps x can be rewritten as (sqrt(n) - 1)^2 +3. Let's see:\n\n(sqrt(n) -1)^2 =n -2\u221an +1.\n\nSo x =n-2\u221an +4= (n-2\u221an +1) +3 = (sqrt(n)-1)^2 +3.\n\nSo x is (sqrt(n)-1)^2 +3. Since (sqrt(n)-1)^2 is always non-negative, the minimum x occurs when (sqrt(n)-1)^2 is as small as possible.\n\nWhat's the minimum value of (sqrt(n)-1)^2?\n\nIt's zero when sqrt(n) =1 \u2192 n=1. But n is between 36 and 72, so sqrt(n) is between 6 and ~8.485.\n\nSo (sqrt(n)-1)^2 is positive in this range.\n\nThe minimum value of x occurs when (sqrt(n)-1)^2 is minimized.\n\nThe minimum of (sqrt(n)-1)^2 is when sqrt(n) is as close to 1 as possible. But in our case, sqrt(n) is at least 6. So the minimum (sqrt(n)-1)^2 is when sqrt(n)=6, which is (6-1)^2=25.\n\nSo x_min =25 +3=28, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSimilarly, when sqrt(n) is maximum (sqrt(72)=~8.485), (8.485-1)^2 = (7.485)^2\u224856.03. So x=56.03 +3\u224859.03.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to about 59.03.\n\nNow, looking at the options again:\n\nOption D:28 <x <60 \u2192 correct, since x is up to ~59.03, which is less than 60.\n\nOption C:25 <x <64 \u2192 correct, as x is from 28 to ~59.03, which is within 25 and 64.\n\nSo both options C and D are correct? But that can't be, as the options are single-choice.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is to find which option x satisfies the condition for all n in 36\u2264n\u226472. So for all n in that range, x is in the specified interval.\n\nSo, for example, if the question is \"x is between which of the following intervals for all n in 36\u2264n\u226472\", then the correct option must fully encompass all possible x.\n\nIn that case, both C and D encompass the x range. But looking at the options, perhaps the tightest correct option is D, since it's more precise.\n\nWait, but the options are A to E, with E being none of these. But since both C and D are correct, perhaps the intended answer is D, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in the way x is simplified.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me compute x for n=36 and n=72 and see which options include these values.\n\nn=36: x=28. So x=28 is the minimum.\n\nn=72: x\u224859.03.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to about 59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C:25 <x <64 \u2192 includes 28 to 59.03.\n\nOption D:28 <x <60 \u2192 includes 28 to 59.03, since 59.03<60.\n\nSo both options C and D include the entire x range. But the problem is to choose the correct option, which is one of them.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct option is the one that exactly covers the x range, but that's not the case. So perhaps I need to look for which option is correct.\n\nWait, the problem states that x satisfies the condition for n in 36\u2264n\u226472. So for all n in that range, x must lie within the given option's range.\n\nSo for option D, 28 <x <60. At n=36, x=28, which is not less than 28, so x=28 is the minimum. So the condition 28 <x would exclude n=36. But the question is whether x satisfies the condition for n in 36\u2264n\u226472, so x can be equal to 28.\n\nWait, the options are written as inequalities with strict less than. So option D says 28 <x <60. But when n=36, x=28, which is not greater than 28, so it doesn't satisfy option D. Similarly, when n=36, x=28, which is not greater than 28, so it doesn't satisfy option D. So option D is incorrect because at n=36, x=28 which is not greater than 28.\n\nWait, but wait, the options are written as \"satisfies\" meaning for all n in the range, x must lie within the option's range. So if for any n in the range, x doesn't satisfy the option's condition, that option is incorrect.\n\nSo for option D, when n=36, x=28, which is not greater than 28, so D is incorrect.\n\nSimilarly, option C says 25 <x <64. At n=36, x=28>25, so that's okay. At n=72, x\u224859.03<64, so that's okay. So option C is correct because for all n in 36\u2264n\u226472, x is between 28 and 59.03, which is within 25 and 64.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that option D was correct, but upon reevaluating the inequalities, since option D requires x>28, which isn't true when n=36, option D is incorrect.\n\nSo the correct option is C:25 <x <64.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start with the given expression for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{n^2 + 2\\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16}{n + 4\\sqrt{n} + 4}\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Expression\nLet \\( a = \\sqrt{n} \\), so \\( n = a^2 \\) and \\( \\sqrt{n} = a \\). Substituting these into the expression:\n\n- **Numerator**: \\( n^2 + 2\\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 \\) becomes:\n  \\[\n  a^4 + 2a(a^2 + 4) + 16 = a^4 + 2a^3 + 8a + 16\n  \\]\n\n- **Denominator**: \\( n + 4\\sqrt{n} + 4 \\) becomes:\n  \\[\n  a^2 + 4a + 4 = (a + 2)^2\n  \\]\n\nFactoring the numerator:\n\\[\na^4 + 2a^3 + 8a + 16 = (a + 2)^2(a^2 - 2a + 4)\n\\]\n\nThus, the expression simplifies to:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{(a + 2)^2(a^2 - 2a + 4)}{(a + 2)^2} = a^2 - 2a + 4\n\\]\n\nSince \\( a = \\sqrt{n} \\), we have:\n\\[\nx = n - 2\\sqrt{n} + 4\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Range of \\( x \\)\nGiven \\( 36 \\leq n \\leq 72 \\), we compute \\( x \\) at the endpoints:\n\n1. **At \\( n = 36 \\):**\n   \\[\n   x = 36 - 2\\sqrt{36} + 4 = 36 - 12 + 4 = 28\n   \\]\n\n2. **At \\( n = 72 \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{72} = 6\\sqrt{2} \\approx 8.485, \\quad 2\\sqrt{72} \\approx 16.970\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 72 - 16.970 + 4 \\approx 59.03\n   \\]\n\nSince \\( x = n - 2\\sqrt{n} + 4 \\) is an increasing function in the interval \\( 36 \\leq n \\leq 72 \\), \\( x \\) ranges from approximately **28 to 59.03**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Options\nWe evaluate each option to determine if it fully encompasses the range of \\( x \\):\n\n- **Option A: \\( 20 < x < 54 \\)**  \n  This is incorrect because \\( x \\) can exceed 54 (e.g., \\( x \\approx 59.03 \\)).\n\n- **Option B: \\( 23 < x < 58 \\)**  \n  This is incorrect because \\( x \\) can exceed 58 (e.g., \\( x \\approx 59.03 \\)).\n\n- **Option C: \\( 25 < x < 64 \\)**  \n  This is correct because \\( x \\) ranges from 28 to 59.03, which is entirely within \\( 25 < x < 64 \\).\n\n- **Option D: \\( 28 < x < 60 \\)**  \n  This is incorrect because \\( x = 28 \\) (at \\( n = 36 \\)) does not satisfy \\( x > 28 \\).\n\n- **Option E: None of these**  \n  This is incorrect because Option C is valid.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe correct option is **C**, as it fully encompasses the range of \\( x \\) for \\( 36 \\leq n \\leq 72 \\).\n\n**Answer: C**",
