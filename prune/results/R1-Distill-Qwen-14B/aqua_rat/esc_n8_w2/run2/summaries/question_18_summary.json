      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a home appliance store selling microwaves. Hmm, let me read it again. Last year, they sold an average of 42 microwaves per month. Then, in the first 10 months of this year, they averaged only 20 per month. The question is asking for the average number sold per month over the entire 22-month period.\n\nWait, wait. So last year is one year, which is 12 months. Then this year, they've had 10 months. So 12 plus 10 is 22 months total. Got it.\n\nThe average for the first 12 months was 42. That means the total number sold in those months would be 42 multiplied by 12. Let me calculate that. 42 times 12 is... let's see, 40 times 12 is 480, and 2 times 12 is 24, so 480 plus 24 is 504. So last year, they sold 504 microwaves.\n\nThen, this year, the first 10 months averaged 20 per month. So the total for those 10 months would be 20 times 10. That's easy, 200.\n\nSo the total over 22 months is 504 plus 200. Let me add that up. 504 plus 200 is 704.\n\nNow, to find the average per month over 22 months, I divide the total by 22. So 704 divided by 22. Hmm, let's see. 22 times 30 is 660. Because 22 times 30 is 660. Subtract that from 704: 704 minus 660 is 44. 44 divided by 22 is 2. So 30 plus 2 is 32. Wait, no. Wait, 22 times 32 is 704 because 32*20 is 640, 32*2 is 64, 640+64=704. Oh, right, so 704/22 is 32.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check. 22 times 30 is 660. 704 minus 660 is 44. 44 divided by 22 is 2. So 30 + 2 is 32. So yes, the average is 32. So the answer should be D)32.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculations. Last year: 42 average for 12 months, 42*12=504. First 10 months of this year: 20*10=200. Total is 504+200=704. Total months 22. 704/22=32. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nSo looking at the options, D is 32, so the answer is D.\n",

The question is asking for the average number sold per month over the entire 22-month period. Oh wait, so that's last year plus this year up to now, right? Because last year is 12 months, and this year they're talking about the first 10, so 12+10=22 months total.\n\nI remember that averages are about total divided by the number of periods. So maybe I need to calculate the total number sold in each period and then add them up, then divide by 22.\n\nLet me think. Last year, the average was 42 per month. So for 12 months, the total would be 42 multiplied by 12. Let me calculate that. 42 times 12. Hmm, 40 times 12 is 480, and 2 times 12 is 24, so 480 +24=504. So last year they sold 504 microwaves in total.\n\nThen this year, the first 10 months averaged 20 per month. So the total is 20 multiplied by 10, which is 200. So this year, up to now, they've sold 200 microwaves.\n\nAdding those together, 504 +200 equals 704. So over 22 months, they sold 704 microwaves in total.\n\nNow, to find the average per month, I divide the total by 22. So 704 divided by 22. Let me do that division. Hmm, 22 times 31 is 682 because 22*30 is 660, plus 22 is 682. Then, 704 minus 682 is 22. So 22 divided by 22 is 1. So 31 plus 1 is 32. Wait, no, wait. Wait, let me think again. Because 22 * 32 is 704, right? Let me check: 22*30 is 660, 22*2 is 44, so 660+44=704. Oh, right! So 704 divided by 22 is exactly 32.\n\nSo the average over the 22 months is 32. Let me look at the options. Option D is 32. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So 42*12: 40*12 is 480, 2*12=24, 480+24=504. Correct. 20*10=200. 504+200=704. 704 divided by 22: 22*32=704. Yes, that's right. So the average is 32. So the correct answer is D.\n",
