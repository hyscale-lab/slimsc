      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question here about renting DVDs and whether it's worth getting a membership. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nHmm, the question says that without a membership, each DVD rental costs $4.00. But if I buy a membership for $7.00 a month, each rental only costs $2.00. I need to find the minimum number of DVDs I have to rent to make the membership worth it. So, I guess I should compare the total costs for both options and see when the membership becomes a better deal.\n\nWait, right. So without the membership, each DVD is $4. So if I rent 'x' movies, the total cost is 4x dollars. With the membership, I pay a flat fee of $7 plus $2 per DVD. So the total cost there is 7 + 2x.\n\nI need to find the smallest x where 7 + 2x is less than 4x. Because that's when the membership becomes more economical. So I'll set up the inequality: 7 + 2x < 4x.\n\nLet me solve that. Subtract 2x from both sides: 7 < 2x. Then divide both sides by 2: 7/2 < x, which is 3.5 < x. Since x has to be an integer (you can't rent half a DVD), x must be at least 4. Because 3.5 is halfway between 3 and 4. So if I plug in x=4, let's check.\n\nWithout membership: 4 *4 = $16.\nWith membership: 7 + (4 *2) = 7 +8 = $15. So yes, $15 is less than $16. So renting 4 movies would save me a dollar.\n\nWait, but what about x=3? Let me check. Without: 3*4=12. With:7 + 3*2=7+6=13. Oh, so 13 is more than 12. So at 3 movies, it's cheaper not to have the membership. So the minimum number is 4.\n\nLooking at the options, D is 4. So the answer should be D.\n",

The question is asking for the minimum number of DVDs I need to rent so that getting the membership becomes more cost-effective than paying per movie without a membership.\n\nLet me break down the costs. Without a membership, each DVD costs $4.00. So if I rent, say, x movies, it'll cost me 4x dollars. On the other hand, if I buy the membership for $7.00 per month, each rental only costs $2.00. So the total cost with the membership would be 7 + 2x dollars.\n\nI think I need to find the smallest x where the cost with the membership is less than or equal to the cost without. So, I should set up an inequality: 7 + 2x \u2264 4x.\n\nWait, let me write that down properly. The cost without membership is 4x, and the cost with is 7 + 2x. So the inequality is 7 + 2x \u2264 4x.\n\nTo solve for x, I can subtract 2x from both sides. That gives me 7 \u2264 2x.

So the minimum number of DVDs I need to rent is 4.\n\nLet me check the options. The options are A)1, B)2, C)3, D)4, E)5. So D is 4, which should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the math. Let me plug x=3 into both costs. Without membership: 3*4=12. With membership: 7 + (3*2) = 7 +6=13. Oh, so at 3, it's cheaper without the membership. So 3 isn't enough. What about x=4? Without: 4*4=16. With:7 + 8=15. So 15 is less than 16.
