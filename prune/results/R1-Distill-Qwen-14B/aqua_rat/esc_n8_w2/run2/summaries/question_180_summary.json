      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Ace Book Company's sales revenue. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question says that last year, 34% of Ace Book Company's sales revenue came from novels. Then, of the remaining revenue\u2014which would be the part not from novels\u20141/3 was from biographies. The question is asking how many times the revenue from novels is compared to the revenue from biographies. So, I need to find the ratio of novel revenue to biography revenue.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. Let's assume the total revenue is 100 units for simplicity. Wait, but maybe using variables would be better. Let me denote the total revenue as R. So, R is the total revenue.\n\n34% of R comes from novels. So, the revenue from novels is 0.34 * R.\n\nThe remaining revenue is R minus the novel revenue. So, R - 0.34R = 0.66R. This remaining part is 66% of the total revenue.\n\nOf this remaining 66%, 1/3 is from biographies. So, the revenue from biographies is (1/3) * 0.66R.\n\nLet me calculate that. 1/3 of 0.66 is 0.22. So, the biography revenue is 0.22R.\n\nWait, let me double-check that: 0.66 divided by 3 is 0.22. Yep, that's right.\n\nSo, now I have the novel revenue as 0.34R and biography revenue as 0.22R.\n\nThe question is asking how many times the novel revenue is compared to biography revenue. So, I need to find the ratio of novels to biographies.\n\nThat would be 0.34R divided by 0.22R. The R cancels out, so it's 0.34 / 0.22.\n\nLet me compute that. 0.34 divided by 0.22.\n\nWell, 0.22 times 1.5 is 0.33, right? Because 0.22 * 1.5 = 0.33. But 0.34 is a bit more than that. So, 0.34 is 0.33 + 0.01. So, 0.22 * 1.5 is 0.33, and then I have an extra 0.01.\n\nSo, 0.01 divided by 0.22 is approximately 0.045. So, 1.5 + 0.045 is about 1.545. So, roughly 1.55.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 1.5, which is close but a bit lower. Option C is 2.1, which is higher. Wait, did I make a mistake here?\n\nWait a second, maybe I should calculate 0.34 divided by 0.22 more accurately.\n\nLet me do this division step by step.\n\n0.34 divided by 0.22.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as 34 divided by 22, because moving the decimal two places for both numerator and denominator.\n\n34 divided by 22. Let me compute that. 22 goes into 34 once (22), remainder 12. Bring down a zero, making it 120. 22 goes into 120 five times (22*5=110), remainder 10. Bring down another zero, making it 100. 22 goes into 100 four times (88), remainder 12. So, the pattern repeats: 1.545454..., so approximately 1.545.\n\nSo, that's approximately 1.545 times. So, looking at the options, the closest one is B) 1.5, but wait, 1.545 is closer to 1.5 than 2.1, right?\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculations. Let me go back.\n\nWait, the remaining revenue after novels is 66% (0.66R). Of that, 1/3 is from biographies. So, 0.66 * (1/3) = 0.22R. That part is correct.\n\nSo, novel revenue is 0.34R, biography is 0.22R. The ratio is 0.34/0.22 = approximately 1.545.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is B) 1.5. But wait, 1.545 is about 1.55, which is approximately 1.55 times. So, none of the options is exactly 1.55. The options are A)1.3, B)1.5, C)2.1, D)2.5, E)3.1.\n\nSo, 1.545 is closer to 1.5 (B) than to 2.1. So the correct answer should be B) 1.5.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Did I miscalculate the remaining percentage?\n\nWait, the remaining after 34% is 66%, correct. Then, 1/3 of that is 22%. So, novels are 34%, biographies are 22%.\n\nSo, 34 /22 is 1.545, which is approximately 1.55.\n\nLooking at the options, the only option near 1.55 is B)1.5 and C)2.1. Since 1.5 is closer, the answer would be B. But wait, perhaps the question is looking for an approximate, and maybe 34 divided by 22 is roughly 1.54, which is about 1.5 times. So, yes, B is the closest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial problem setup. Let me double-check.\n\nThe question states that 34% was from novels. The remaining (which is 66%) had 1/3 from biographies. So, 66% * (1/3) = 22% from biographies. So, 34% divided by 22% is 34/22 = 1.545... So, approximately 1.55 times. So, 1.55 is closer to 1.5 than to 2.1, so option B is the answer.\n",
