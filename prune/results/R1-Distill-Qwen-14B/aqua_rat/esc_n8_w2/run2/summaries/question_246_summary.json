      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I'm a bit new to these kinds of questions, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nAlright, the problem says that there's a 90% chance that a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election. So each voter has a 0.9 probability of having voted. Now, the question is about choosing five voters at random and finding the approximate likelihood that exactly four of them voted.\n\nHmm, right. This sounds like a binomial probability problem because we have a fixed number of independent trials (five voters), each with two possible outcomes (voted or didn't vote), and we want the probability of a certain number of successes (exactly four voted).\n\nThe binomial probability formula is P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k), where C(n,k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.\n\nSo in this case, n is 5, k is 4. p is 0.9, and 1-p is 0.1.\n\nLet me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the combination C(5,4). I remember that C(n,k) is n!/(k! (n-k)! ). So 5! is 120, 4! is 24, and (5-4)! is 1. So 120/(24 *1) = 5. So C(5,4) is 5.\n\nNext, p^k is 0.9^4. Let me calculate that. 0.9 squared is 0.81, then 0.9 cubed is 0.81 * 0.9 = 0.729. 0.9^4 is 0.729 * 0.9 = 0.6561.\n\nThen (1-p)^(n-k) is 0.1^(5-4) = 0.1^1 = 0.1.\n\nNow multiply all those together. So 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1.\n\nLet me compute that. 5 * 0.6561 is 3.2805, then multiplied by 0.1 is 0.32805.\n\nSo that's approximately 0.32805, which is 32.805%. Looking at the options, option B is 32.8%, so that must be the answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me double-check the exponents.\n\n0.9^4: 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81, *0.9=0.729, *0.9=0.6561. Yep, that's correct.\n\n0.1^1 is 0.1, right.\n\nSo 5 * 0.6561 is indeed 3.2805. Then times 0.1 is 0.32805, which is 32.8%. So yeah, B is the correct option.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we recognize it as a binomial probability question.

I remember that binomial distributions are used when there are a fixed number of independent trials, each with two possible outcomes: success or failure.
