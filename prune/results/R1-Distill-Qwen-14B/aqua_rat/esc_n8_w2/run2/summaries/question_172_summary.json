      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Christopher and Jonathan flipping a coin. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says that they flipped a coin 20 times. Each time it's heads, Christopher gives $2 to Jonathan, and each time it's tails, Jonathan gives $3 to Christopher. After all the flips, neither of them won or lost any money. So I need to find out how many times the coin landed on heads.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Let's denote the number of heads as H and the number of tails as T. Since they flipped the coin 20 times, H plus T should equal 20. So H + T = 20.\n\nNow, the money exchange part. Every head, Christopher gives $2 to Jonathan. So for H heads, he gives away 2*H dollars. On the flip side, for each tail, Jonathan gives $3 to Christopher, so he gives away 3*T dollars.\n\nBut wait, the net result is that neither gained nor lost money. So the total money exchanged must balance out. That means the amount Christopher lost (gave) equals the amount he gained (received). So, the money he lost is 2*H, and the money he gained is 3*T. So 2*H (lost) must equal 3*T (gained), because in the end, there's no net gain or loss.\n\nSo setting up the equation: 2H = 3T.\n\nNow, since H + T = 20, I can express T as 20 - H. Let me substitute that into the equation.\n\n2H = 3*(20 - H)\nExpanding the right side: 2H = 60 - 3H\nNow, let's get all H terms on one side. Adding 3H to both sides:\n2H + 3H = 60\n5H = 60\nDividing both sides by 5:\nH = 12.\n\nWait, so H is 12? Let me check that. If H is 12, then T is 20 -12 =8.\n\nSo for heads, Christopher gives away 2*12 =24 dollars. For tails, Jonathan gives 3*8=24 dollars. So 24 given and 24 received. That means no net gain or loss. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 12. So the answer should be E.\n",

Since they ended up neither winning nor losing, the total money exchanged must balance out.\n\nWait, so the total money gained by Jonathan should equal the total money lost by Christopher, right? Because the net result is zero.\n\nLet me set some variables. Let's say the number of heads is H, and the number of tails is T. Since there are 20 flips, H + T = 20.\n\nNow, for each head, Jonathan gains $2, so total gain for him is 2H. For each tail, Jonathan loses $3, so total loss is 3T. But wait, no, wait. Wait, no, when it's tails, Jonathan gives $3 to Christopher, so Jonathan loses $3 per tail. So for Jonathan, his net gain is (2H - 3T). But since they ended up with no loss or gain, that net gain must be zero.\n\nSo 2H - 3T = 0.\n\nAnd since H + T = 20, we can solve these two equations.\n\nLet me write them down:\n\n1) H + T = 20\n\n2) 2H - 3T = 0\n\nFrom equation 2: 2H = 3T \u2192 H = (3T)/2\n\nNow substitute into equation 1:\n\n(3T/2) + T = 20\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n(3T + 2T)/2 = 20 \u2192 5T/2 = 20 \u2192 5T =40 \u2192 T=8.\n\nSo T is 8, then H is 20 -8=12.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check that. If H is 12, T is 8.\n\nSo, for heads, 12 times: 12 * 2 = $24 to Jonathan.\n\nTails, 8 times: 8 *3 = $24 from Jonathan to Christopher.\n\nSo the total for Jonathan is +24 (from heads) minus 24 (from tails) equals zero.
