      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again: \"What is 60% of 30% of 1400 grams?\" The options are A) 450 gms, B) 100 gms, C) 252 gms, D) 240 gms, and E) None of these. Hmm, alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that percentages are parts per hundred, so 30% is like 30 per 100, or 0.3 in decimal. Similarly, 60% is 0.6. The problem says 60% of 30% of 1400 grams. So I think I need to calculate this in two steps. \n\nWait, maybe I can combine them into a single calculation. Like, 60% of (30% of 1400). So the order is important here. I should first find 30% of 1400 grams, and then take 60% of that result. Or wait, is there a way to combine the percentages? Let me think. Because percentages multiply when you take one after another. So 30% is 0.3, then 60% of that is 0.6 * 0.3. So 0.6 * 0.3 equals 0.18. So that would be 18% of 1400 grams. Oh, that's a simpler way to do it.\n\nAlternatively, I could do each step separately. Let's try both methods to make sure.\n\nFirst method: 30% of 1400. So 1400 * 0.3. Let me calculate that. 1400 * 0.3 is 420 grams. Okay, so 30% of 1400 is 420. Now, 60% of that 420 grams. So 420 * 0.6. Hmm, 400 * 0.6 is 240, and 20 * 0.6 is 12. So 240 +12 is 252 grams. So that's 252 grams. \n\nWait, let me double-check that math. 420 * 0.6: 420 times 0.6. 400 *0.6 is 240, 20 *0.6 is 12, yes, so 252. So the result is 252 grams.\n\nAnother way: 30% is 0.3, 60% is 0.6. Multiply 0.3 *0.6 = 0.18. So 0.18 of 1400. 1400 *0.18. Let me calculate that. 1400 * 0.1 is 140, 1400 *0.08 is 112. Adding 140 +112 gives 252. Yep, same answer.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 252 grams. So that's the correct answer. Let me check if any of the other options are close. Option D is 240, which is 1400 *0.6*0.4? Wait, maybe someone confused the order? Wait, if someone did 60% of 1400 first, that would be 840, then 30% of 840 is 252 as well. Oh wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 60% of 1400 is 840. Then 30% of 840 is 252 as well. Oh, so regardless of the order, the answer is the same? Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, because multiplication is commutative. So 0.3 * 0.6 is the same as 0.6 *0.3, so the order doesn't matter. So whether you take 30% first or 60% first, you get the same result. So that's why both methods gave me 252. So the correct answer is C.\n\nSo the options are: A)450, B)100, C)252, D)240. So the correct one is C.\n",

Hmm, percentages can sometimes get a bit tricky, but I think I can handle it.\n\nAlright, let me break it down. The question is asking for two successive percentages applied to the same number. So first, I need to find 30% of 1400 grams, and then take 60% of that result. Alternatively, I could calculate it in one step by multiplying the percentages together. Wait, which way is easier?\n\nLet me try both methods to make sure I get the same answer. First method: 30% of 1400 grams.

So 0.30 * 1400 = let's see... 1400 * 0.3. 1400 * 0.3 is the same as 1400 * 3/10, which is 420. So 30% of 1400 is 420 grams.\n\nNow, I need 60% of that 420 grams. Again, convert 60% to decimal: 0.60.
