      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where when you divide 2272 and 875 by a three-digit number N, you get the same remainder. I need to find the sum of the digits of N, and the options are from A to E. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nWait, I remember that if two numbers, say A and B, when divided by N leave the same remainder, then the difference between A and B should be divisible by N. Because when you subtract the two remainders (which are the same), they cancel out, and you're left with a multiple of N.\n\nSo in this case, A is 2272 and B is 875. So the difference would be 2272 - 875. Let me calculate that. 2272 minus 800 is 1472, and then minus 75 is 1397. So 2272 - 875 = 1397. That means N must be a divisor of 1397.\n\nBut wait, N is a three-digit number, right? So I need to find all the three-digit divisors of 1397 and then find which one's digits add up to one of the given options.\n\nFirst, let's factorize 1397. Hmm, I'll try dividing 1397 by small primes. Let's see, 1397 divided by 11: 11 times 127 is 1397? Wait, 11*127 is 1397? Let me check. 127 * 10 is 1270, plus 127 is 1397. Yeah, so 1397 = 11 \u00d7 127. Are 11 and 127 primes? 11 is definitely prime. What about 127? Let's see, does 2 go into it? No, 3? 1+2+7=10, not divisible by 3. 5? Ends with 7, so no. 7? 7*18=126, 127-126=1, so no. 11? 11*11 is 121, 121+6=127, so no. So yes, 127 is prime. So the factors of 1397 are 1, 11, 127, and 1397.\n\nBut N has to be a three-digit number. So looking at the factors, 11 is two-digit, 127 is three-digit, and 1397 is four-digit. So the only three-digit divisor is 127.\n\nSo N is 127. Now, let's find the sum of its digits. 1 + 2 + 7 equals 10. Wait, but 10 is option A. But let me double-check because sometimes I might have missed something.\n\nWait, could there be other three-digit divisors? Because 1397 divided by 127 is 11, which is prime, so no other factors. So N must be 127.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. The problem says that when you divide both 2272 and 875 by N, you get the same remainder. So let's confirm that. Let me compute 2272 \u00f7 127 and 875 \u00f7 127.\n\nCalculating 127 \u00d7 17: 127\u00d710=1270, 127\u00d77=889. So 1270 + 889 = 2159. Wait, but 127 \u00d7 18 is 2159 +127=2286, which is larger than 2272. So 2272 divided by 127 would be 17 times with a remainder. Let me compute 2272 - (127 \u00d717). 127\u00d717: 127\u00d710=1270, 127\u00d77=889. 1270 + 889=2159. 2272 -2159=113. So the remainder is 113.\n\nNow, let's do 875 \u00f7127. 127 \u00d76 is 762. 875-762=113. So the remainder is also 113. Yep, so both give the same remainder. So N is 127.\n\nThe sum of the digits is 1 +2 +7=10, which is option A. But wait, the options are A)10, B)11, etc. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Are there any other three-digit numbers that could satisfy this condition? Because 1397 could have other factors if I made a mistake in factorization. Let me check again.\n\n1397 divided by 7: 7 \u00d7 199 is 1393, which is 4 less than 1397, so no. 1397 \u00f713: 13 \u00d7107 is 1391, 1397-1391=6, so no. 1397 \u00f717: 17 \u00d782=1394, 1397-1394=3, so no. 19? 19 \u00d773 is 1387, 1397-1387=10, not a multiple. So no, I think 127 is the only three-digit divisor.\n\nSo yeah, the sum is 10. So the answer should be A.\n",

Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says: When 2272 and 875 are divided by a 3-digit number N, they leave the same remainder. I need to find the sum of the digits of N, and the options are A)10, B)11, C)12, D)13, E)14.\n\nHmm, right. So both numbers when divided by N give the same remainder. Let me think about what that implies.\n\nI remember that if two numbers, say a and b, when divided by N leave the same remainder, then the difference between a and b should be divisible by N. Because when you subtract the two remainders (which are the same), you get a multiple of N. Oh wait, wait.

So first, let's factorize 1397 to find its divisors.\n\nFactorizing 1397. Let's see. Does 1397 divide by small primes?\n\nLet me test 11 first. 11 times 127 is 1397? Wait, 11*127 is 1397? Let me calculate 127*11. 127*10 is 1270, plus 127 is 1397. Yes, so 1397 = 11 * 127.\n\nWait, but 127 is a prime number, right? Let me check. 127 divided by 2? No. 3? 1+2+7=10, not divisible by 3. 5?

So the sum is 10, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Is there any other three-digit number that could be a divisor of 1397? Because 1397 is 11*127, and 127 is prime.
