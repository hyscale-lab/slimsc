      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about dividing Rs 8600 among a bunch of people. Let me try to figure this out step by step. \n\nThe problem says a man divides 8600 rupees among 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews. The conditions are that each daughter gets four times as much as each nephew, and each son gets five times as much as each nephew. I need to find out how much each daughter receives.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. I think I should assign a variable to the amount each nephew gets because everything else is related to that. Let's say each nephew gets x rupees. \n\nSo, each daughter gets four times that. That means each daughter gets 4x. And each son gets five times as much as each nephew, so each son gets 5x.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the total amount given to each group and sum them up to equal 8600.\n\nLet's see. There are 5 sons, so the total for sons is 5 times 5x, which is 25x. For the daughters, 4 of them each getting 4x, so that's 4 *4x=16x. And the nephews are 2, each getting x, so that's 2x.\n\nWait, wait. Let me make sure I got that right. So sons: 5 sons *5x =25x. Daughters: 4 *4x=16x. Nephews: 2 *x=2x. So adding all together: 25x +16x +2x = 43x.\n\nAnd the total amount is 8600, so 43x = 8600. To find x, I divide both sides by 43. Let's calculate that: 8600 divided by 43. Hmm, 43 times 200 is 8600, right? Because 43*200=8600. So x is 200.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me double-check that. 43 multiplied by 200: 43*200= (40*200)+(3*200)= 8000 +600=8600. Yep, correct. So x is 200.\n\nEach daughter gets 4x, so 4 *200=800. So each daughter gets Rs 800. Looking at the options, E is 800, so the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the setup. Did I assign the right variables? Let me see: nephew is x, daughter is 4x, son is 5x. Yes, that's correct. Then the total is 5*5x (sons) +4*4x (daughters) +2x (nephews) =25x+16x+2x=43x. Right.\n\nSo 43x=8600, x=200. Each daughter is 4x=800. So yes, E is the correct answer.\n",

Each daughter gets four times as much as each nephew, and each son gets five times as much as each nephew. The question is asking how much each daughter receives.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I think the key here is to figure out the amount each nephew gets first because the sons and daughters get multiples of that. Once I know the nephew's share, I can calculate the others.\n\nSo, let's assign variables. Let me call the amount each nephew receives as N. Then, each daughter would receive 4N, and each son would get 5N. That makes sense because the problem states each daughter is four times a nephew, and sons are five times.\n\nNow, let's think about how much each group gets. There are 5 sons, so the total for sons is 5 times 5N, which is 25N. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, that's not right. Oh wait, no, each son gets 5N, so 5 sons would get 5 * 5N = 25N. Right.\n\nThen, the daughters: each daughter gets 4N, and there are 4 of them. So total for daughters is 4 * 4N = 16N.\n\nThe nephews: there are 2, so 2 * N = 2N.\n\nSo the total amount is the sum of all these parts. So total = 25N (sons) + 16N (daughters) + 2N (nephews). Adding those together: 25 +16 is 41, plus 2 is 43. So 43N is the total amount.\n\nBut wait, the total amount is Rs 8600. So 43N = 8600. To find N, I can divide 8600 by 43.\n\nLet me calculate that. Hmm, 43 times 200 is 8600, right? Because 43 * 200 = 8600. So N is 200.\n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check that. 43 * 200: 40*200=8000, 3*200=600. 8000+600=8600. Yes, correct. So N is 200.\n\nSo each daughter gets four times N, which is 4 * 200 = 800. So each daughter gets Rs 800.\n\nLooking at the options, E is Rs 800. So that must be the answer.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't mix up the numbers. Let me recalculate the total to confirm.\n\nNephews: 2 * 200 = 400.\n\nSons: 5 * (5 * 200) = 5 * 1000 = 5000. Wait, no, wait. Wait, each son gets 5N, which is 5*200=1000. So 5 sons get 5*1000=5000.\n\nDaughters: 4 * (4*200)=4*800=3200.\n\nNephews: 2*200=400.\n\nAdding them up: 5000 +3200=8200, plus 400 is 8600.
