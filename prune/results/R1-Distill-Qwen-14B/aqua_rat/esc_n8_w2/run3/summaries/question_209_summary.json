      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here: 900 plus 5 times 12. Hmm, let me think about how to solve this. I remember from school that when solving equations, I need to follow the order of operations. Oh right, PEMDAS or BODMAS\u2014those mnemonics to remember the order. So that stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction.\n\nWait, in this problem, there are no parentheses or exponents. So the next step is to handle multiplication before addition. Right, so I should calculate 5 multiplied by 12 first. Let me do that: 5 times 12 is... 60, I think. Yeah, 5 times 10 is 50, plus 5 times 2 is 10, so 50+10=60.\n\nSo now the problem simplifies to 900 plus 60. Oh, that's easy. 900 plus 60 is 960. So the result should be 960.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 960. So that's the correct answer. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Did I miss any steps? No, I did the multiplication first because of the order of operations, then added it to 900. Yep, that's right. So the answer must be E.\n",

Wait, what's that order again? Oh right, it's PEMDAS or something like that\u2014Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction. Right, so I should do the multiplication before adding.\n\nSo the problem is 900 + 5 \u00d7 12. Let me break it down. First, I need to calculate 5 multiplied by 12. What's 5 times 12? Let me think. 5 times 10 is 50, and 5 times 2 is 10, so 50 plus 10 is 60. So 5 \u00d7 12 equals 60.\n\nNow that I've got that, the equation simplifies to 900 plus 60.

So that must be the correct answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Did I do the multiplication first? Yes, 5 times 12 is 60. Then adding 900 gives me 960.
