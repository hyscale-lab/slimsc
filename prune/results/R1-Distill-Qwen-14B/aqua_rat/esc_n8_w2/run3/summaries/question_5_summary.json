      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out the cost price of an article that a trader sold at a 20% profit for Rs.360. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nWait, profit is calculated based on the cost price, right? So the selling price is the cost plus 20% of the cost. Oh right, because profit percentage is always on the cost price. So if I denote the cost price as CP, then the selling price (SP) would be CP plus 20% of CP. Which can also be written as SP = CP \u00d7 (1 + 20/100) because 20% is 0.2, so 1.2 times CP.\n\nWait, the selling price given is 360 Rs. So I can set up the equation as 360 = CP \u00d7 1.2. To find CP, I need to divide 360 by 1.2. Let me do that calculation.\n\n360 divided by 1.2. Hmm, 1.2 times 300 is 360, because 300 \u00d7 1.2 is 360. So that would make CP 300 Rs. Let me check the options. Option B is 300, so that should be the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not making any mistakes here. Sometimes I confuse profit on selling price or cost price. No, I remember correctly that profit is on cost price. So the calculation should be correct. Another way to think is, 20% profit on CP leads to SP being 120% of CP. So 120% of CP is 360, so CP is 360 \u00d7 (100/120) which is 300. Yep, same result.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. So the correct answer should be option B.\n",

Oh right, because 100% is the cost, and 20% profit adds up to 120%.\n\nSo, mathematically, I can write this as: Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit.
