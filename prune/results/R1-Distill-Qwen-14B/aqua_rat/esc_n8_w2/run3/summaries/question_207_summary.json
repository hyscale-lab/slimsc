      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it again carefully. The question says: If 10 is subtracted from two-thirds of a number, the result is equal to the sum of 40 and one-third of the number. I need to find the number. The options are A)100, B)160, C)150, D)210, E)220.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. I'll call the unknown number 'x' for simplicity. So, according to the problem, two-thirds of x minus 10 equals the sum of 40 and one-third of x. Let me write that equation out.\n\nSo, (2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x.\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. Let's see. First, I can try to get all the x terms on one side and the constants on the other. Maybe subtract (1/3)x from both sides to start.\n\nSo, (2/3)x - (1/3)x -10 = 40.\n\nWait, (2/3)x minus (1/3)x is (1/3)x. So the equation simplifies to:\n\n(1/3)x -10 =40.\n\nNow, I can add 10 to both sides to isolate the term with x.\n\n(1/3)x = 50.\n\nTo solve for x, I need to multiply both sides by 3. Let me do that.\n\nx = 50 *3 = 150.\n\nWait, so x is 150. Let me check the options. Option C is 150, so that should be the answer. But just to be sure, let me plug it back into the original equation to verify.\n\nLeft side: (2/3)*150 -10. Let's compute that. 2/3 of 150 is (150 /3)*2 = 50*2=100. Then subtract 10: 100-10=90.\n\nRight side: 40 + (1/3)*150. 1/3 of 150 is 50. So 40+50=90. Both sides equal 90. That checks out.\n\nSo, yeah, the correct answer must be C)150.\n",

So, two-thirds of this number would be (2/3)x. Then, 10 is subtracted from that, so that part would be (2/3)x - 10.\n\nOn the other side of the equation, we have the sum of 40 and one-third of the number. So that's 40 + (1/3)x.\n\nSo putting it all together, the equation should look like this:\n\n(2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x.\n\nNow, I need to solve for x.
