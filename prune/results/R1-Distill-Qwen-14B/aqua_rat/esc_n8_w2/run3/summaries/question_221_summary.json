      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about two numbers that are in the ratio 3:5. Then, when you subtract 9 from each, the new ratio becomes 12:23. The question is asking for the smaller number. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that ratios can be represented with variables. Like, if two numbers are in the ratio 3:5, I can let the numbers be 3x and 5x, where x is a common multiplier. That makes sense because 3x divided by 5x would simplify to 3/5.\n\nSo, the original numbers are 3x and 5x. Now, the problem says that if 9 is subtracted from each, the new ratio is 12:23. Let me write that down. Subtracting 9 from each gives (3x -9) and (5x -9), and their ratio is 12:23.\n\nSo, I can set up a proportion here. (3x -9)/(5x -9) = 12/23. To solve for x, I can cross-multiply. That gives me 23*(3x -9) = 12*(5x -9).\n\nLet me compute each side. On the left side, 23*3x is 69x, and 23*(-9) is -207. So left side is 69x -207. On the right side, 12*5x is 60x, and 12*(-9) is -108. So right side is 60x -108.\n\nNow, bring all the terms to one side. Let's subtract 60x from both sides and add 108 to both sides to get:\n\n69x -60x -207 +108 = 0. Simplify that: 9x -99 = 0.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 69x -207 = 60x -108. Subtract 60x from both sides: 9x -207 = -108. Then add 207 to both sides: 9x = 99. So x is 99/9 = 11.\n\nWait, wait, did I do that right? So, 9x = 99. So x is 11. That seems straightforward.\n\nSo x is 11. Now, the original numbers are 3x and 5x. The smaller number is 3x, which is 3*11=33. So the smaller number is 33.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 33. So that's the answer.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me plug x=11 back into the original numbers. The numbers are 33 and 55. Subtract 9 from each: 24 and 46. Now, 24:46 simplifies by dividing both by 2, which gives 12:23. Yep, that matches the given ratio. So the calculations are correct.\n\nSo the answer is B)33.\n",

So initially, the two numbers have a ratio of 3:5. Let me think about how to represent that mathematically.\n\nI remember that when two numbers are in a ratio, they can be expressed as multiples of a common variable. Let's say the numbers are 3x and 5x, where x is some positive integer. So, the first number is 3x, the second is 5x. That makes sense because 3x/5x reduces to 3/5.\n\nNow, the problem says that if we subtract 9 from each, their new ratio becomes 12:23. So, the new numbers are (3x -9) and (5x -9). And their ratio is 12:23.\n\nSo I can set up an equation here. The ratio of (3x-9)/(5x-9) equals 12/23. Let me write that down:\n\n(3x - 9)/(5x - 9) = 12/23.\n\nTo solve for x, I'll cross-multiply.

So right side is 60x -108.\n\nPutting it together: 69x -207 = 60x -108.\n\nNow, I'll subtract 60x from both sides: 69x -60x -207 = -108 \u2192 9x -207 = -108.\n\nNext, add 207 to both sides: 9x = -108 + 207. Let me compute that. 207 minus 108 is 99, so 9x = 99.\n\nDivide both sides by 9: x = 11.\n\nOkay, so x is 11. Now, the smaller original number is 3x, right? Because the two numbers are 3x and 5x, and 3x is smaller.\n\nSo 3x = 3*11 = 33.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, 33 is option B. Hmm. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me check my steps again. The equation setup: (3x-9)/(5x-9) = 12/23. Cross-multiplying gives 23*(3x-9) = 12*(5x-9). Expanding both sides: 69x - 207 = 60x -108. Subtracting 60x: 9x -207 = -108. Adding 207: 9x=99. So x=11. Correct.\n\nSo the smaller number is 3x = 33. So the answer should be B)33.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe plugging in the numbers to see if they fit.\n\nIf the numbers are 33 and 55 (since 5x=5*11=55), then subtracting 9 gives 24 and 46.\n\nIs 24:46 equal to 12:23? Let's see, 24 divided by 12 is 2, and 46 divided by 23 is 2. So yes, they simplify to the same ratio. So that works.\n\nSo the correct answer is B)33.\n",
