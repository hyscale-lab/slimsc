      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this algebra problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question says, \"If 6x minus y equals 24 and y equals 3x, what is the value of x?\" And then there are five options to choose from.\n\nHmm, alright, let's break this down. I remember from school that when you have two equations with the same variables, you can substitute one into the other to solve for one variable first. That's probably what I need to do here.\n\nSo the first equation is 6x - y = 24. The second equation is y = 3x. Since the second equation already expresses y in terms of x, maybe I can substitute that into the first equation. That way, I'll have an equation with only x, which I can solve.\n\nLet me try that. If I replace y in the first equation with 3x, it should look like this: 6x - (3x) = 24. Oh, right, because y is 3x, so wherever y is, I put 3x there.\n\nWait, so 6x minus 3x equals 24. Let's compute that. 6x minus 3x is 3x, right? So 3x equals 24. Now, to find x, I just need to divide both sides by 3. \n\n3x divided by 3 is x, and 24 divided by 3 is 8. So x should be 8. Let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nIf x is 8, then y should be 3 times 8, which is 24. Let's plug those values back into the first equation. 6 times 8 is 48, and 48 minus y (which is 24) equals 24. 48 minus 24 is indeed 24. So that checks out.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me go through each step again. \n\nOriginal equations:\n1) 6x - y = 24\n2) y = 3x\n\nSubstitute equation 2 into equation 1:\n6x - (3x) = 24\nSimplify 6x -3x to 3x:\n3x = 24\nDivide both sides by 3:\nx = 8\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the value of x is 8. Looking at the options, option A is 8. So the answer should be A.\n\nI don't think I missed anything here. The substitution method worked smoothly. Another way to approach it could be to solve equation 2 for y and then plug into equation 1, but that's essentially what I did. Alternatively, I could rearrange equation 1 to express y in terms of x and see if that gives the same result, but I think it's unnecessary since substitution worked.\n\nWait, let me try solving for y another way. From equation 1, 6x - y =24, so y = 6x -24. But equation 2 says y =3x. So setting them equal: 3x =6x -24. Hmm, subtract 3x from both sides: 0=3x -24. Add 24 to both sides: 24=3x. Then x=8. Same answer. So yes, that's consistent. \n\nAlright, confident that x is 8. So the correct option is A.\n",
