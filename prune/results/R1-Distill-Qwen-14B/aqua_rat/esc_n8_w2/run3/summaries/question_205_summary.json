      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a liquid passing through a drain. Hmm, let me read it again. The problem says the liquid flows at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. I need to find out how many minutes it will take for y gallons to pass through the drain. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I think I should find the flow rate in gallons per second and then convert it to gallons per minute because the question asks for the time in minutes.\n\nWait, the rate is w/25 gallons every x seconds. So the rate per second would be (w/25) divided by x, right? Because if it's w/25 gallons in x seconds, then per second it's (w/25)/x gallons. Let me write that as (w)/(25x) gallons per second.\n\nBut wait, I might have that backward. Oh no, actually, if it's w/25 gallons in x seconds, the rate is (w/25) divided by x. So yeah, that's (w)/(25x) per second. Got it.\n\nNow, I need to find the time it takes for y gallons to pass. Time is equal to amount divided by rate. So time in seconds would be y divided by (w/(25x)). Let me write that as y / (w/(25x)).\n\nDividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So that becomes y * (25x / w) which is (25xy)/w seconds.\n\nBut the question asks for the time in minutes. So I need to convert seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute. So I divide the time in seconds by 60. So time in minutes is (25xy)/(w * 60).\n\nSimplify that: 25 divided by 60 is the same as 5/12, because 25*4=100, 60*4=240, but wait, 25/60 can be reduced. Let me think. 25 and 60 are both divisible by 5. 25 divided by 5 is 5, 60 divided by 5 is 12. So 25/60 is 5/12. So the time becomes (5xy)/(12w) minutes.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, I see option C is 5xy/(12w), which matches what I got. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nLet me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should approach it using unit conversions. The rate is w/25 gallons per x seconds. So the rate is (w/25) gallons per x seconds. To get gallons per minute, I can find how many x seconds are in a minute. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so the number of x-second intervals in a minute is 60/x.\n\nSo the rate in gallons per minute is (w/25) * (60/x) = (w * 60)/(25x) = (12w)/(5x). Wait, wait, let me calculate that again. 60 divided by 25 is 2.4, which is 12/5. So yeah, (w * 60)/(25x) = (12w)/(5x) gallons per minute.\n\nNow, to find the time t in minutes to get y gallons: y = rate * time. So time t = y / rate.\n\nSo t = y / ( (12w)/(5x) ) ) = y * (5x)/(12w) = (5xy)/(12w). Yep, same result as before. So option C is correct.\n",
