      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about renting DVDs and memberships. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is asking for the minimum number of DVDs I need to rent to make the membership worth it. \n\nRight, so without the membership, each DVD costs $4.00. But if I buy a membership for $7.00 a month, each rental only costs $2.00. I need to find out when the total cost with the membership becomes better or equal to the cost without it.\n\nWait, wait. So I guess I should set up an equation where the cost without membership is equal to the cost with membership. That way, I can find the break-even point.\n\nLet me think: Let x be the number of DVDs. Without the membership, the total cost is 4x dollars. With the membership, it's 7 dollars for the membership plus 2x dollars for the rentals. So the equation would be:\n\n4x = 7 + 2x\n\nHmm, solving for x. Subtract 2x from both sides:\n\n4x - 2x = 7  \n2x =7  \nx=7/2  \nx=3.5\n\nWait, but you can't rent half a DVD. So I guess you'd need to round up to the next whole number. So x is 4. So you have to rent at least 4 DVDs for the membership to be worth it.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Let me calculate the total cost for 3 and 4 DVDs.\n\nWithout membership:\n3 DVDs: 3 *4 = $12\n4 DVDs: 4*4= $16\n\nWith membership:\n3 DVDs: 7 + (3*2) =7+6=13. So 13 is more than 12. So 3 isn't enough. \n\n4 DVDs: 7+ (4*2)=7+8=15. Without, it's 16. So 15 is less than 16. So yes, renting 4 would save money.\n\nSo the minimum number is 4. Looking at the options, option D is 4.\n",

Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nHmm, the question is asking for the minimum number of DVDs I need to rent to make the membership worth it. So I guess I need to compare the total cost without the membership versus the total cost with the membership and find when the membership becomes cheaper or equally good.\n\nAlright, let me jot down the details. Without a membership, each DVD costs $4.00. If I buy a membership for $7.00 per month, each rental only costs $2.00. So I need to figure out when the cost with membership becomes less than or equal to the cost without.\n\nLet's define the number of DVDs as 'x'. The cost without membership would be 4 times x, right? So that's 4x dollars. The cost with membership is the membership fee plus 2 times x, so that's 7 + 2x dollars.\n\nWe want to find the smallest x where the membership option is better or equal. So we set up the inequality:\n\n4x \u2265 7 + 2x\n\nWait, because if 4x is greater than or equal to 7+2x, then the membership is cheaper or the same. So solving for x, I subtract 2x from both sides:\n\n4x - 2x \u2265 7  \n2x \u22657  \nx \u22657/2  \nx \u22653.5\n\nBut x has to be a whole number because you can't rent half a DVD. So x has to be at least 4. Wait, no. Let me double-check. 3.5 means that at 3 rentals, the cost without membership is 12 dollars (3*4=12). With membership, it would be 7 + 2*3=13. Oh, so 13 is more than 12. So 3 rentals aren't enough. \n\nWhat about 4 rentals? Without membership, 4*4=16. With membership, 7+2*4=15. So 15 is less than 16. So 4 is the point where membership becomes cheaper. So the minimum number is 4.\n\nWait, but wait another second. The options don't have 4 as an option. Let me check the options again. Oh, the options are A)1, B)2, C)3, D)4, E)5. So D is 4, which would be the answer.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check my math. Let me make a table:\n\nNumber of DVDs | Cost without membership | Cost with membership\n---------------|-------------------------|---------------------\n1              | 4*1=4                   |7+2=9 \u2192 9 >4 \u2192 not worth\n2              |8                        |7+4=11 \u219211>8\u2192 no\n3              |12                       |7+6=13 \u219213>12\u2192 no\n4              |16                       |7+8=15 \u219215<16\u2192 yes, worth it.\n\nSo the minimum is 4.
