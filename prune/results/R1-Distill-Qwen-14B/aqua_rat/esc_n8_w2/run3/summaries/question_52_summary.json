      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again. A man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 and a half percent of his income. The question is, what's his monthly income? The options are A to E, with E being none of these. \n\nHmm, so he's saving 12.5% of his income. That means the rest of his income is what he's spending. Let me think about how savings and spending relate. If he saves a certain percentage, then his spending is the remaining percentage. \n\nWait, 12.5% is the saving part. So, the spending must be 100% minus 12.5%, right? Because all his income is either spent or saved. So that's 87.5% spent on other things. \n\nSo, he's spending 87.5% of his income, and that amount is Rs. 3500. I need to find his total income. Let me set this up as an equation. Let his income be 'I'. \n\nSo, 87.5% of I equals 3500. Mathematically, that's 0.875 * I = 3500. To find I, I can divide both sides by 0.875. \n\nWait, maybe I should think about 12.5% as a fraction. 12.5% is the same as 1/8, right? Because 12.5 multiplied by 8 is 100. So, if he saves 1/8 of his income, then he's spending 7/8 of it. Because 1 - 1/8 is 7/8. \n\nSo, 7/8 of his income is 3500. Therefore, I can write (7/8) * I = 3500. To solve for I, I can multiply both sides by 8/7. \n\nLet me do that calculation. 3500 multiplied by 8 is 28000. Then, 28000 divided by 7 is 4000. So, I is 4000. \n\nLooking back at the options, option C is Rs. 4000. So that should be the correct answer. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nAlternative way: 12.5% is the saving, so the saving amount is 12.5% of I, which is (12.5/100)*I. His spending is I minus this saving. So, spending = I - (0.125 * I) = 0.875 I. And that equals 3500. So 0.875 I =3500. I = 3500 / 0.875. \n\nLet me compute 3500 divided by 0.875. Hmm, 0.875 is the same as 7/8, so dividing by 7/8 is the same as multiplying by 8/7. \n\n3500 * 8 = 28000. 28000 /7 = 4000. Yep, same result. \n\nSo, the income is 4000. So option C is correct. I don't see any mistake in the reasoning. So the answer should be C.\n",

The question is asking what his monthly income is. The options are A to E, with some specific numbers.\n\nHmm, so he saves 12.5% of his income. Wait, 12 and a half percent is the same as 12.5%, right? So that's like a fraction. I remember that 12.5% is equivalent to 1/8 because 1/8 is 0.125, which is 12.5%. So if he saves 1/8 of his income, then the remaining part must be what he spends. Let me think about that.\n\nSo his income is divided into two parts: the amount he saves and the amount he spends. He saves 12.5%, so he must be spending the rest. What's the rest? Well, 100% minus 12.5% is 87.5%. So the Rs. 3500 he spends is 87.5% of his income.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another approach is better. Let me denote his monthly income as I. He saves 12.5% of I, which is (12.5/100) * I. So the amount saved is (0.125) * I. The amount he spends is I minus the amount saved. So, I - 0.125I equals 0.875I. And that's equal to 3500.\n\nSo, 0.875 * I = 3500. To find I, I need to divide both sides by 0.875.\n\nLet me compute that. 3500 divided by 0.875. Hmm, what's 0.875 in fraction? Oh right, 0.875 is 7/8. So dividing by 7/8 is the same as multiplying by 8/7.\n\nSo 3500 * (8/7) = I.\n\nLet me compute 3500 divided by 7 first. 3500 /7 is 500. Because 7*500=3500. Then multiply by 8. 500 *8 is 4000. So I is 4000.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is Rs. 4000. So that must be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me check the calculations again.\n\nHis income is 4000. He saves 12.5%, which is 4000 * 0.125 = 500. So he saves 500, spends 3500. 500 + 3500 is 4000.
