      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about employees taking vacations. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, I remember from set theory that this might involve some kind of Venn diagram. \n\nThe question says that 75% of employees take a winter vacation. So, if I imagine a circle representing winter vacationers, it's 75% of the total. Then, 40% take both winter and summer vacations. That's the overlap between the two circles. And 20% take neither, so that's outside both circles. I need to find the percentage that takes summer but not winter.\n\nWait, let's think about the total. The total percentage of employees should add up to 100%. So, 20% take neither, which leaves 80% who take at least one vacation. So, 80% is the union of winter and summer vacationers.\n\nI remember the formula for the union of two sets: P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B). Here, A is winter, B is summer. \n\nSo, P(A \u222a B) is 80%, P(A) is 75%, P(A \u2229 B) is 40%. Let me plug these into the formula.\n\n80% = 75% + P(B) - 40%. Let me compute that. 75% minus 40% is 35%, so 80% equals 35% plus P(B). That means P(B) is 80% minus 35%, which is 45%. Oh wait, that's the total who take summer vacation, including those who take both.\n\nBut the question asks for those who take summer but not winter. So I have to subtract the overlap from the total summer vacationers. P(B only) is P(B) minus P(A \u2229 B). So that's 45% minus 40% equals 5%. Wait, that gives 5%, which is option A. But wait, that seems low. Let me double-check.\n\nWait another approach: Let me represent this with a Venn diagram. The winter circle is 75%. The overlap is 40%, so the part of the winter circle that doesn't overlap with summer is 75% minus 40% = 35%. \n\nThe total in both circles is 80%, as I thought earlier. So the summer circle includes the overlap (40%) plus those who take only summer. So, let me denote S as only summer. So, 40% (overlap) + S = total summer. But the total in the union is winter (75%) + summer (S + 40%) - overlap (40%) = 75 + S = 80%? Wait, no, that approach might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the total in the union is 80%, which is winter (75%) plus summer only (S) minus the overlap. Oh wait, no. The union is winter only + summer only + both. So, winter only is 75% minus both (40%), which is 35%. Summer only is S, and both is 40%. So 35% + S + 40% = 80%? Wait, no, because the union is 80%, which is the sum of winter only, summer only, and both. Wait, no, the union is the total of all in either set. So, the union is winter only + summer only + both. Or is it?\n\nWait, no. The union is the sum of winter and summer minus their intersection. So, the union is 75% + (summer only + both) - both = 75% + summer only. But that's not right. Let me correct.\n\nWait, the formula is P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B). So 80% = 75% + P(B) - 40%. So P(B) is 80% +40% -75% = 45%. So the total summer vacationers are 45%, which includes those who take both. So, the only summer vacationers would be 45% -40% =5%. So the answer is 5%, which is option A. But that seems a bit low. Let me check again.\n\nWait, let me think of it as the sum of all parts. The company has 100% employees. 20% take neither, so 80% take at least one vacation. Of those 80%, 75% take winter, which includes some who also take summer. So, the winter only is 75% - 40% (both) = 35%. The summer only is what we're looking for. So, 35% (winter only) + summer only +40% (both) =80%? No, because the 80% is the total. So 35% (winter only) + S (summer only) +40% (both) would be 35 + S +40 = 75 + S =80. So S =5%. So yes, that's 5% take summer only. So the answer is A)5%.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we use set theory and the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let the total number of employees be represented as 100%. The key information is:\n\n1. **75%** of employees take a winter vacation.\n2. **40%** of employees take both a winter and a summer vacation.\n3. **20%** of employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation.\n\nFrom the total of 100%, the 20% who take neither vacation leaves **80%** who take at least one vacation (winter, summer, or both).

Then, 40% take both winter and summer. And 20% take neither. Oh right, so the company's total employees are 100%, right?\n\nI think I can model this with a Venn diagram. Two circles: one for winter vacationers and one for summer. The overlapping part is those who take both. So, the winter circle is 75%, and the summer circle includes both those who take only summer and those who take both.\n\nWait, but the 40% take both. So, if 75% take winter, that includes the 40% who take both. So the number of people who take only winter is 75% minus those who take both. Let me calculate that. 75% minus 40% gives 35% who take only winter.\n\nNow, the problem is to find those who take summer but not winter. Let me denote the total summer vacationers as S. So, S is the sum of those who take only summer and those who take both. But I don't know S yet. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's think about the total percentage. The total employees are 100%. Some take neither, which is 20%. So the remaining 80% take at least one vacation. Because 100% -20% = 80%. \n\nSo those 80% are the union of winter and summer vacationers. The formula for the union is winter + summer - both. So, 75% + S - 40% = 80%.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. 75 + S -40 =80. So 35 + S =80. Oh, so S is 45%?

So, the number taking only winter is 75% -40% =35%. \n\nNow, the 80% taking at least one vacation is made up of only winter (35%), only summer (let's call this x), and both (40%). So 35 + x +40 =80. Wait, that's 75 +x =80 \u2192 x=5%. So yes, x is 5%. So the percentage taking summer but not winter is 5%, which is option A. \n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right.
