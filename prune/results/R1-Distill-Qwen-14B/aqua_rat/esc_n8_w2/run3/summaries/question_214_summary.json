      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a boy climbing stairs. The question is asking how many different ways he can reach the top of a staircase with 10 steps. He can take either one or two steps each time. Hmm, I think I've heard of this kind of problem before. It feels like a classic combinatorial problem or maybe something related to the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nWait, right! I remember that this is similar to the staircase problem where the number of ways to reach the nth step is the sum of the ways to reach the (n-1)th step and the (n-2)th step. Because, you see, if the boy is at step 10, he could have gotten there by taking a single step from step 9 or by taking a double step from step 8. So the total ways to get to step 10 would be the sum of the ways to get to step 9 and step 8.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure I understand the base cases. Let's think about small numbers to get it right. For n=1, there's only one way: take a single step. So ways(1)=1.\n\nWhat about n=2? He can take two single steps (1+1) or one double step (2). So that's two ways. So ways(2)=2.\n\nNow for n=3. He can come from step 2 or step 1. The ways to step 2 are 2, and to step 1 are 1. So 2+1=3 ways. Let me list them: 1+1+1, 1+2, 2+1. Yep, three ways.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be the Fibonacci sequence, but shifted. Because Fibonacci usually starts with Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, etc. Wait, but here ways(1)=1, ways(2)=2, ways(3)=3. So maybe it's the same as the (n+1)th Fibonacci number? Let's see.\n\nWait, let's think about the sequence of ways:\n\nn | ways(n)\n1 | 1\n2 | 2\n3 | 3\n4 | 5\n5 | 8\n6 | 13\n7 | 21\n8 | 34\n9 | 55\n10| 89\n\nWait, because each step's ways is the sum of the previous two. So the number of ways for 10 steps would be 89. Looking at the options, B is 89.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the calculation step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me list the number of ways for each step up to 10:\n\nways(1) = 1\n\nways(2) = ways(1) + ways(0)? Wait, wait, did I forget about ways(0)? Hmm, I think I might have. Because when n=0, it's the base case. How many ways to stay at the ground level? Well, there's exactly one way: do nothing. So ways(0) =1.\n\nSo maybe the formula is ways(n) = ways(n-1) + ways(n-2), with ways(0)=1, ways(1)=1.\n\nWait, that changes things. Let me recalculate:\n\nn | ways(n)\n0 | 1\n1 | 1\n2 | ways(1)+ways(0)=1+1=2\n3 | ways(2)+ways(1)=2+1=3\n4 | ways(3)+ways(2)=3+2=5\n5 | 5+3=8\n6 | 8+5=13\n7 |13+8=21\n8 |21+13=34\n9 |34+21=55\n10|55+34=89\n\nYes, so that's consistent. So the number of ways for 10 steps is 89. So the correct answer is option B.\n",
