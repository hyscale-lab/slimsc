      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a group with boys and girls. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nSo initially, there are 64 boys and 40 girls. Then, during a membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. Now, the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3. I need to find out how many members are in the group now.\n\nHmm, let's see. Let me denote the number of boys and girls that joined as 'x'. So after the new members joined, the number of boys becomes 64 + x, and the number of girls becomes 40 + x. \n\nThe ratio of boys to girls is now 4:3. So I can set up the equation (64 + x)/(40 + x) = 4/3.\n\nWait, I should cross-multiply to solve for x. So 3*(64 + x) = 4*(40 + x).\n\nLet me compute that. 3*64 is 192, and 3*x is 3x. On the other side, 4*40 is 160, and 4*x is 4x. So putting it together: 192 + 3x = 160 + 4x.\n\nHmm, subtract 3x from both sides: 192 = 160 + x. Then subtract 160 from both sides: 32 = x. So x is 32.\n\nWait, so 32 boys and 32 girls joined. Let me check that. \n\nSo the new number of boys is 64 + 32 = 96. The new number of girls is 40 +32=72. \n\nThe ratio of 96 to 72 should be 4:3. Let's see: 96 divided by 72 is 4/3 because 96 \u00f7 24 =4 and 72 \u00f724=3. Yep, that works.\n\nNow, the total number of members now is 96 +72 = 168. \n\nWait, but looking at the options, I see option E is 168. But wait, let me check the options again. Oh, the options are A)277, B)288, C)200, D)277, E)168. So E is the correct choice.\n\nWait a minute, but I just want to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me recheck the calculations.\n\nSo, the initial numbers are 64 boys and 40 girls. x joins both, so boys =64+x, girls=40+x.\n\nRatio is 4:3, so (64+x)/(40+x)=4/3.\n\nCross-multiplying gives 3*(64+x)=4*(40+x). So 192 +3x = 160 +4x.\n\nSubtract 3x: 192=160 +x. Subtract 160: 32 =x.\n\nSo x is 32. Boys become 96, girls 72. 96+72=168. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer must be E)168.\n",

Then, during a membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. Now, the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3. The question is asking how many members are in the group now.\n\nAlright, let me break this down. So, the initial numbers are 64 boys and 40 girls. Let me call the number of boys who joined as x, and since the same number of girls joined, that's also x. So after the drive, the number of boys becomes 64 + x, and the number of girls becomes 40 + x.\n\nThe ratio of boys to girls now is 4:3. So, (64 + x)/(40 + x) = 4/3. I think I can set up an equation here. Let me write that down.\n\nSo, (64 + x)/(40 + x) = 4/3. To solve for x, I can cross-multiply. That gives 3*(64 + x) = 4*(40 + x). Let me compute both sides.\n\nLeft side: 3*(64 + x) = 3*64 + 3x = 192 + 3x.\nRight side: 4*(40 + x) = 4*40 +4x = 160 +4x.\n\nSo, equation becomes 192 +3x = 160 +4x. Let me subtract 3x from both sides: 192 = 160 + x. Then subtract 160: 32 = x. So, x is 32. That means 32 boys and 32 girls joined.\n\nNow, the new number of boys is 64 +32 =96. Girls:40 +32=72. So the total number of members now is 96 +72= 168.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option E is 168. So that should be the answer, right? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, wait. Let me recheck the cross-multiplication step. 3*(64 +x) =4*(40 +x). 3*64 is 192, 3x is 3x. 4*40 is 160, 4x. So 192 +3x =160 +4x. Subtract 3x: 192=160 +x. So x=32.
