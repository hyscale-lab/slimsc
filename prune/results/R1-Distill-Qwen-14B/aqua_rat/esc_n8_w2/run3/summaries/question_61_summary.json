      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.\n\nThe problem says: In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball, and the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class?\n\nHmm, right. So, we're given percentages and fractions of the total students interested in different sports, and some students are uninterested. The question is asking for the total number of students.\n\nLet me think about the variables involved. Let's denote the total number of students as N. So, N is what we're trying to find.\n\nBreaking down the information:\n\n- Football: 8% of N \u2192 0.08N\n- Cricket: 4/5 of N \u2192 0.8N\n- Basketball: 10% of N \u2192 0.10N\n- Not interested in any: 20 students.\n\nWait a second. So, the students who are interested in at least one of the sports plus the ones not interested should add up to the total. But wait, is that the case? Or is there an overlap between the sports? Because if a student is interested in more than one sport, they would be counted multiple times in the percentages. But the problem doesn't specify anything about overlaps. Hmm, that complicates things. Oh wait, but the problem might be assuming that each student is interested in exactly one sport or none. Or maybe not. Hmm, maybe I should proceed under the assumption that each student is counted in one category only, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the percentages are exclusive, but that might not be the case.\n\nWait, but let's read the problem again. It says 8% are interested in Football, 4/5 in Cricket, 10% in Basketball, and the remaining 20 aren't interested in any. Oh, wait, perhaps the 20 are the ones not interested in any of these three. So, the rest are interested in at least one of the sports. But then, the sum of the percentages of students interested in each sport would be more than 100%, which would imply overlaps. But the problem doesn't give any info about overlaps, so perhaps the intended approach is to sum up the interested percentages and subtract that from 100% to find the remaining students. But wait, that might not be correct because of possible overlaps. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is phrased in a way that each student can be interested in any number of sports, but the percentages are just the proportion of students interested in each sport, regardless of other interests. So, the total number of students interested in at least one sport would be N minus 20. But then, the sum of the percentages would include overlaps. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved without considering overlaps, meaning that each student is interested in exactly one of the sports or none. So, the sum of the percentages plus the 20% (or 20 students) would equal 100%. Let me check.\n\nWait, let me see: 8% + 4/5 + 10% + 20 = 100%. Wait, 4/5 is 80%, so 8% + 80% +10% is 98%, and the remaining 2% are the 20 students. So, 2% of N is 20. That would mean N is 1000, because 2% of 1000 is 20. So, that would make the answer E)1000.\n\nBut wait, wait a minute. Let me double-check. So, 8% football, 80% cricket, 10% basketball. So 8 + 80 +10 = 98%. So the remaining 2% are the 20 students. So, 2% of N is 20. So N = 20 / 0.02 = 1000. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. So, that would be 100% - (8% + 80% +10%) = 2% of N equals 20. So N is 1000. So the correct answer would be E)1000.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about the problem in terms of equations. Let's denote N as the total number of students.\n\nThe sum of the students interested in each sport plus the students not interested equals N.\n\nBut wait, if a student is interested in more than one sport, they would be counted in multiple categories. But the problem doesn't provide information about overlaps, so perhaps the problem assumes that each student is interested in exactly one sport or none. So, the sum of the interested students would be 8% + 80% +10% = 98% of N, and the remaining 2% are the 20 students. So 0.98N + 20 = N. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 0.98N is the sum of the interested students, and 20 are the uninterested, so total N is 0.98N + 20. So, N - 0.98N = 20 \u2192 0.02N =20 \u2192 N=20/0.02=1000.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the total number of students is 1000. Looking at the options, E is 1000.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The question says 4/5 are interested in cricket. 4/5 is 80%, so that's correct. 8% is football, 10% basketball, so 8+80+10=98%. 2% is 20 students, which is 1000 total. So that's correct.\n\nI think that's the right approach. So the answer should be E)1000.\n",

The rest, which is 20 students, aren't interested in any games. I need to find out how many students are in the class.\n\nHmm, let's see. So I think I should add up all the percentages of students interested in each sport and then see what percentage is left, which is the 20 students who aren't interested. Then I can set that percentage equal to 20 and solve for the total number of students.\n\nWait, the total can't be more than 100%, right? So let me break it down:\n\nFootball is 8%, Cricket is 4/5. Wait, 4/5 is a fraction. Let me convert that to a percentage. 4 divided by 5 is 0.8, so 0.8 times 100 is 80%. Oh wait, wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, 4/5 is 0.8, so 0.8 as a percentage is 80%. So 80% are interested in Cricket.\n\nBasketball is 10%, and the rest are 20 students. So let's add up the percentages: Football (8%) + Cricket (80%) + Basketball (10%) = 98%. So the remaining percentage is 100% - 98% = 2%. And that 2% equals 20 students.\n\nSo if 2% equals 20, then 1% would be 10. Therefore, the total number of students is 100%, which would be 100 times 10, which is 1000. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me double-check the calculations. So 8% + 80% is 88, plus 10% is 98. So yeah, 2% left. 2% is 20 students. So 2% is 20, so 1% is 10. So total is 100 * 10 = 1000.

So N - 0.98N = 0.02N. So 0.02N = 20.\n\nSolving for N: N = 20 / 0.02 = 1000. So yes, 1000. So the answer is E.\n",
