      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. It's about a 5-digit number with a specific property. The problem says that if you put a 1 after this number, it becomes three times as large as when you put a 1 before it. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nWait, let me make sure I understand. So the number is, say, ABCDE. Putting a 1 after it would make it ABCDE1, which is a 6-digit number. Putting a 1 before it would make it 1ABCDE, another 6-digit number. The condition is that the first one (ABCDE1) is three times the second one (1ABCDE). So mathematically, ABCDE1 = 3 * 1ABCDE.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me think about how to model this. Let's denote the original 5-digit number as N. So N is a 5-digit number, which means it's between 10000 and 99999.\n\nWhen we put a 1 after N, that's the same as N * 10 + 1. Because adding a digit to the right is like multiplying by 10 and adding the digit. So, for example, if N is 12345, then putting a 1 after it would be 123451, which is 12345 * 10 + 1.\n\nPutting a 1 before N would be 100000 + N. Because adding a digit to the left adds that digit times the appropriate power of 10. Since N is a 5-digit number, adding a 1 before it would shift it left by 5 digits, which is multiplying by 100000, but wait, no. Wait, the number 1ABCDE is 1 followed by N, so that's 100000 + N. Because N is 5 digits, adding 1 before it makes a 6-digit number.\n\nSo according to the problem, N * 10 + 1 = 3 * (100000 + N).\n\nLet me write that equation out:\n\nN * 10 + 1 = 3 * (100000 + N)\n\nExpanding the right side: 3 * 100000 + 3N = 300000 + 3N.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n10N + 1 = 300000 + 3N.\n\nLet me subtract 3N from both sides to get:\n\n7N + 1 = 300000.\n\nThen subtract 1 from both sides:\n\n7N = 299999.\n\nSo N = 299999 / 7.\n\nHmm, let me compute that. Let me see, 7 times 42857 is 299,999. Wait, 7 * 42857. Let me check:\n\n42857 * 7: 7 * 7 is 49, write down 9, carry 4. 5*7 is 35 +4 is 39, write 9, carry 3. 8*7=56+3=59, write 9, carry 5. 2*7=14 +5=19, write 9, carry 1. 4*7=28 +1=29. So 299999. So yes, 42857 *7 is 299,999.\n\nSo N would be 42857. Let me check the options. Option A is 42857, which matches.\n\nWait, but let me verify the condition to be thorough. So putting a 1 after N gives 428571. Putting a 1 before N gives 142857.\n\nNow, 142857 multiplied by 3 is 428571. Because 142857 *3: 7*3=21, write 1, carry 2. 5*3=15+2=17, write 7, carry 1. 8*3=24+1=25, write 5, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 1*3=3 +1=4. So 428571. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the number is 42857, which is option A.\n",

The property is that when you add a '1' after the number, it becomes three times as large as when you add a '1' before the number. Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, let's denote the 5-digit number as N. So, N is a 5-digit number. When I put a '1' after it, that's like appending '1' to the end. So mathematically, that would be 10*N + 1, right? Because adding a digit to the right is multiplying by 10 and adding the digit. For example, if N was 123, adding 1 after would make 1231, which is 10*123 +1.\n\nOn the other hand, putting a '1' before the number would be adding it to the ten-thousands place. So for the same N=123, putting a 1 before would make it 1123. Mathematically, that's 100000 + N, but wait, wait. Wait, N is a 5-digit number, so adding a '1' before it would be 1 followed by N. So, for example, N is ABCDE, adding 1 before would make it 1ABCDE, which is 100000 + ABCDE. So the value is 100000 + N.\n\nThe problem states that the number after adding '1' at the end is three times the number after adding '1' at the beginning. So, the equation would be:\n\n10*N + 1 = 3 * (100000 + N)\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check. When you put 1 after N, it's 10*N +1. When you put 1 before N, it's 100000 + N. So yes, the equation is correct.\n\nSo let's write that equation:\n\n10N + 1 = 3*(100000 + N)\n\nLet me expand the right side. 3*(100000 + N) = 300000 + 3N.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n10N + 1 = 300000 + 3N\n\nLet me rearrange terms. Subtract 3N from both sides:\n\n7N + 1 = 300000\n\nThen subtract 1 from both sides:\n\n7N = 299999\n\nSo N = 299999 /7.

Bring down the next 9, making 19. 7 into 19 is 2 (14), remainder 5. Bring down the next 9, making 59. 7*8=56, so 8, remainder 3. Next digit is 9: 39. 7*5=35, remainder 4. Next digit is 9: 49. 7*7=49, remainder 0.
