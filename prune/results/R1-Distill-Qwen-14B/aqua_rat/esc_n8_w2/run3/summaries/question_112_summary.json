      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about the cross-section of a canal shaped like a trapezium. Hmm, trapezium... I think that's a trapezoid in American English. Right, a trapezoid has two parallel sides, which are called the bases, and the other two sides are non-parallel. So, the cross-section of the canal is a trapezoid, meaning the canal is probably a channel with sloping sides.\n\nThe problem gives me the top width as 10 meters and the bottom width as 6 meters. So the two parallel sides are 10m and 6m. The area of the cross-section is 640 square meters, and I need to find the depth of the canal. Wait, depth here probably refers to the height of the trapezoid, which is the distance between the two parallel sides. That makes sense because the area of a trapezoid is calculated using the height.\n\nI remember the formula for the area of a trapezoid is (a + b)/2 multiplied by the height (h), where a and b are the lengths of the two bases. So the formula is Area = (a + b) * h / 2. \n\nLet me plug in the values I have. The top is 10m, bottom is 6m. So a=10, b=6. The area is 640. So:\n\n640 = (10 + 6) * h / 2\n\nWait, let me compute that. 10 +6 is 16. So (16) * h /2 = 8h. So 8h = 640.\n\nWait, no, wait: wait, 16/2 is 8, so 8h = 640. So to find h, I divide both sides by 8. So h = 640 /8. Let me calculate that. 640 divided by 8 is 80. Oh, so h is 80 meters? That seems really deep for a canal, but maybe it's correct.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 80. So I think the answer is D. But wait, I should double-check my formula. Did I get the formula right? Yes, the area of a trapezoid is (sum of the two bases) multiplied by height, divided by two. So yeah, I think that's correct.\n\nBut wait, another thought: sometimes in these problems, the depth might refer to something else. Like, maybe the height isn't the depth. But in a canal's cross-section, the height of the trapezoid would indeed be the depth of the canal. So I think my approach is right.\n\nSo, h is 80 meters. So the correct option is D.\n",

Hmm, trapezium... wait, in the UK, a trapezium is what Americans call a trapezoid, right? So it's a four-sided figure with at least one pair of parallel sides. In this case, I think the cross-section of the canal would have the top and bottom as the parallel sides. \n\nThe problem states that the canal is 10 meters wide at the top and 6 meters wide at the bottom. So the two parallel sides are 10m and 6m. The area of the cross-section is given as 640 square meters. They're asking for the depth of the canal, which I believe is the height of the trapezium because in the context of a canal, the depth would be how deep the water goes, which is perpendicular to the top and bottom.\n\nWait, but I should make sure. So the area of a trapezium is calculated using the formula: (sum of the two parallel sides) multiplied by the height, divided by two.
