      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about arranging books on a shelf. Let me think through it. Hmm, the question says I have six books: English, Hindi, Mathematics, History, Geography, and Science. I need to find out in how many different ways I can arrange them on a shelf.\n\nWait, I remember something about permutations. Oh right, when arranging items where each is unique, the number of ways is a factorial of the number of items. So for n distinct items, it's n factorial, written as n!.\n\nSo in this case, there are 6 books. Each is a different subject, so they're all unique. That means the number of permutations should be 6!.\n\nWhat's 6 factorial equal to? Let me calculate. 6! is 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1. Let's compute that step by step.\n\n6 \u00d75 is 30. 30 \u00d74 is 120. 120 \u00d73 is 360. 360 \u00d72 is 720. Then 720 \u00d71 is still 720. So 6! equals 720.\n\nSo the number of ways to arrange these books is 720. Looking at the options, option B is 720. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Are all the books distinct? The question says English, Hindi, etc. So yeah, each is a different subject, so each is unique. No two books are the same, so no repetition. So I don't need to divide by anything or adjust for identical items.\n\nSo yeah, the answer is 720. So option B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the number of ways to arrange six unique books on a shelf, we use the concept of permutations.

Hmm, the question is asking how many ways I can arrange six different books: English, Hindi, Mathematics, History, Geography, and Science. \n\nWait, right, when it comes to arranging objects, I remember that if all the objects are distinct, the number of ways to arrange them is given by factorial of the number of objects. Oh yeah, factorial is that n! thing where n is the number of items. So for each position on the shelf, I choose one of the remaining books.\n\nSo in this case, there are six books. Let me see, the first position on the shelf can be any of the six books. Once I place one book there, the next position has five options left. Then four, then three, two, and finally one. So the total number of arrangements would be 6 multiplied by 5 multiplied by 4 and so on until 1.\n\nLet me calculate that. 6! is 6\u00d75\u00d74\u00d73\u00d72\u00d71.

The question doesn't mention any restrictions, like certain books needing to be together or not. So yeah, all are distinct and can be arranged in any order.
