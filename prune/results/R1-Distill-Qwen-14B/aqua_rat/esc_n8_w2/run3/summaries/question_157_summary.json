      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says that in a survey of students, each student selected from a list of 10 songs the 2 songs that the student liked best. Then, it says each song was selected 5 times. The question is asking how many students were surveyed. The options are A)96, B)48, C)32, D)25, E)18.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me break this down. So each student picks 2 songs from 10. And each song was chosen 5 times. So, how does that translate into the number of students?\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the total number of song selections. Each student selects 2 songs, so for each student, that's 2 song choices. So if there are N students, the total number of song selections is 2*N.\n\nNow, each song was selected 5 times. There are 10 songs, right? So the total number of times all songs were selected is 10 songs * 5 selections each = 50 times.\n\nBut wait, that's the same as the total selections from all students. Because each student contributes 2 selections. So total selections is 2 * number of students.\n\nSo putting that together: 2*N = 50. So N would be 50 divided by 2, which is 25. So N is 25 students. That would be option D.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Did each song get selected 5 times by different students? Because each student can pick two songs. So for each song, there are 5 different students who chose it. But since each student picks two, the same student's choices might be counted for two different songs.\n\nBut the total across all songs is 50. So the calculation seems right. Each student contributes 2 to the total, so 25 students contribute 50.\n\nSo the answer should be D)25.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the number of students surveyed, consider the following:\n\n1. Each student selects 2 songs from the list of 10. Therefore, for each student, there are 2 song selections.\n2. The total number of song selections across all students is \\( 2 \\times \\text{number of students} \\).\n3. Each of the 10 songs was selected 5 times, so the total number of song selections is \\( 10 \\times 5 = 50 \\).\n4.

Each song was selected 5 times. I need to find out how many students were surveyed. Hmm.\n\nWait, each student selects 2 songs, right? So for each student, two songs get a vote. Now, there are 10 songs, and each song was selected 5 times. So each song was chosen by 5 students, I suppose.\n\nSo the total number of song selections is 10 songs multiplied by 5 selections each. That would be 10 *5 = 50. But wait, each student contributes two selections. So the total number of selections is twice the number of students.\n\nOh right, because each student adds two to the total count. So if I let S be the number of students, then 2*S = total selections. Which is 50.\n\nSo 2S = 50. Solving for S, S=25. So there were 25 students. Looking at the options, D is 25. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Each song is chosen 5 times, 10 songs. So 10*5=50 total song choices. Each student makes two choices, so 50/2=25 students. Yep, that makes sense. So the answer is D.\n",
