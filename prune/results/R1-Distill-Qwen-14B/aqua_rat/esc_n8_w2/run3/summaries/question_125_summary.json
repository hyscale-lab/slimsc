      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a man rowing a boat, and I'm supposed to figure out his speed along the current. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with currents, the effective speed changes depending on whether you're going with or against the current. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nThe problem says the man's rowing rate in still water is 4 kmph. So that's his speed without any current, right? Like, if there's no water moving, he can row at 4 km/h. Then, his rate against the current is 2 kmph. Wait, against the current means he's going upstream, so the current is slowing him down. So his effective speed is 2 km/h in that case.\n\nI think the formula for this involves adding or subtracting the current's speed. Let me recall. If the man's speed in still water is 'b' and the speed of the current is 'c', then when he's going upstream, his effective speed is (b - c). And when going downstream, it's (b + c). Yeah, that sounds right.\n\nSo in this problem, his upstream speed is 2 kmph. So according to the formula, that's (b - c) = 2. But wait, his speed in still water is 4 km/h, so b is 4. Plugging that in, 4 - c = 2. So solving for c, I subtract 2 from 4? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 4 - c equals 2. So c must be 4 - 2, which is 2. So the current's speed is 2 kmph.\n\nNow, the question is asking for his rate along the current, which is downstream. So that would be (b + c). Since b is 4 and c is 2, that's 4 + 2 = 6 kmph. So the downstream speed is 6 km/h.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 6 kmph, and option E is also 6. Wait, that can't be right. Oh, wait, looking again, the options are A)15, B)6, C)12, D)14, E)6. So both B and E are 6. Hmm, that's probably a typo, but the correct answer would be 6, which is option B or E. But since in the options, B is the first one, perhaps the intended correct option is B.\n\nWait, but the options given have E as 6 as well. So maybe the correct answer is B, but why is E there? Maybe the options are a bit off, but the calculation clearly leads to 6. So the answer should be 6 km/h.\n",

The options are A to E, but I notice that option B and E are both 6 kmph, which is a bit confusing, but maybe a typo. Well, I'll proceed.\n\nAlright, so I remember that when dealing with currents, the man's effective speed changes. If he's going against the current, his speed decreases because the current is working against him. When he's going with the current, his speed increases because the current aids him.\n\nSo, let's think about variables. Let me denote:\n\n- The man's rowing speed in still water as 'b' (given as 4 km/h).\n- The speed of the current as 'c' (unknown).\n- His effective speed against the current is (b - c), and with the current is (b + c).\n\nWait, the problem states that his rate against the current is 2 km/h. So, that equation would be:\n\nb - c = 2\n\nWe know b is 4, so substituting:\n\n4 - c = 2\n\nSolving for c: c = 4 - 2 = 2 km/h. So the current is moving at 2 km/h.\n\nNow, the question is asking for his rate along the current, which is (b + c). So plugging in the values:\n\nb + c = 4 + 2 = 6 km/h.\n\nWait, looking at the options, both B and E are 6. That must be a mistake, but since B is option 2, and E is option 5. Hmm, perhaps the options are listed as A, B, C, D, E with B and E the same. Maybe it's a typo. But in any case, the correct answer would be 6 km/h.\n\nSo the options are:\n\nA)15\n\nB)6\n\nC)12\n\nD)14\n\nE)6\n\nSo the correct answer is 6, which is options B and E. But that's impossible. Maybe I made a mistake? Wait, no, let me double-check.\n\nWait, the man's speed in still water is 4. Against the current, it's 2. So 4 - c = 2 \u2192 c=2. So with the current, 4+2=6. Yeah, that's right. So the answer should be 6 kmph. So the options B and E are both 6. Maybe the correct option is B, perhaps E is a duplicate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again. The man's rate against the current is 2 km/h. So yes, 4 - c = 2 \u2192 c=2. So his downstream speed is 6.\n\nSo the correct answer is 6, so looking at the options, both B and E are 6. So either B or E is correct. But in the options, B is 6, E is 6. That's confusing. Maybe the original problem had different options. Well, regardless, the correct answer is 6 kmph.\n",
