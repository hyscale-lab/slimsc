Wait, the question says he wants to find 10 additional people, so including himself, the team would be 11 people in total. Hmm, but maybe the question is just about selecting 10 from his friends, not counting himself.\n\nWait, the question says Peter is forming a team with himself and 10 others. So he's looking for 10 more people. He has 10 friends who are interested. So how many ways can he choose 10 people out of 10?\n\nWait, that's a combinations problem. Because the order in which he selects the team members doesn't matter. So the formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n!/(k!*(n-k)! )\n\nIn this case, n is 10 friends, and k is 10 people needed. So 10 choose 10 is 1, because there's only one way to choose all 10 when you have exactly 10 to choose from.\n\nSo the answer should be 1, which is option B.\n",
