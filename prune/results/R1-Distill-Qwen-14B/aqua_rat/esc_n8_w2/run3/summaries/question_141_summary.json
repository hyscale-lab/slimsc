      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a sporting goods store that sells golf balls. The problem is asking how many yellow golf balls the store had at the beginning of the day. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the store only has yellow and white golf balls. At the start, there are 600 golf balls in total. By the end of the day, they sold 80% of their inventory. Hmm, so 80% sold means they sold 0.8 times 600. Let me calculate that. 0.8 * 600 equals 480. So they sold 480 golf balls in total that day.\n\nWait, the problem says that the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls. Oh, so the number of yellow sold equals the number of white sold. And also, it says that by selling these, they sold all of their white golf balls. Oh, so all the white ones were sold, but maybe not all the yellow ones.\n\nLet me think. Let's denote the number of white golf balls at the beginning as W and yellow as Y. So, W + Y = 600. Because the total is 600.\n\nThey sold all of the white ones, which is W. And since the number of yellow and white sold are equal, they sold W yellow balls as well. So the total sold is W (white) + W (yellow) = 2W. But wait, earlier I found that the total sold was 480. So 2W = 480. Solving for W gives W = 240.\n\nWait, so there were 240 white golf balls at the start. Because they sold all of them. So Y would be 600 - 240 = 360. So the store had 360 yellow golf balls to start with.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Because the total sold is 480, which is 80% of 600. So yes, that's correct. If they sold all white balls, which is 240, and same number of yellow, that's another 240, totaling 480. So that adds up.\n\nSo the answer should be 360. Looking at the options, option E is 360. So the correct answer is E.\n",

Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, the store starts the day with 600 golf balls. That's the total stock. By the end of the day, they've sold 80% of their inventory. Hmm, so first, I should calculate how many they sold. 80% of 600 is... let me see, 0.8 * 600 = 480. So they sold 480 golf balls.\n\nWait, but the problem says they sold an equal number of yellow and white balls. Oh, right, so the total sold (480) is split equally between yellow and white. That means they sold 240 yellow and 240 white balls. Because 480 divided by 2 is 240 each.\n\nBut wait, the problem also states that in selling those white balls, they sold all of their white inventory. So that means the store had exactly 240 white balls at the beginning. Because they sold all of them.\n\nSo if the total stock was 600, and the white balls were 240, then the yellow balls must be 600 - 240 = 360. So the store started with 360 yellow golf balls.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. So total sold is 480, half are white (240) and half are yellow (240). But the white balls were all sold, so initial white stock was 240. So initial yellow was 600 - 240 = 360.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 360. So that should be the answer.\n",
