      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.\n\nThe question is about Ace Book Company's sales revenue. Last year, 34% of their sales came from novels. The rest, which would be the remaining percentage, had 1/3 coming from biographies. The question is asking how many times the revenue from novels is compared to that from biographies. The options are A to E, with numbers like 1.3, 1.5, etc.\n\nHmm, so first, let's figure out what percentage each category contributes. We know 34% is novels. The rest is 100% minus 34%, which is 66%. Then, of that 66%, a third comes from biographies.\n\nWait, so 1/3 of 66% is the percentage from biographies. Let me calculate that. 66 divided by 3 is 22. So biographies make up 22% of the total revenue.\n\nNow, the question is the ratio of the revenue from novels to that from biographies. So it's asking for (revenue from novels) divided by (revenue from biographies).\n\nSince we're dealing with percentages, I can treat the total revenue as 100 units for simplicity. So, 34 units are from novels, and 22 units from biographies.\n\nSo the ratio would be 34 divided by 22. Let me do that division. 34 \u00f7 22 equals... let's see, 22 goes into 34 once, that's 22, with a remainder of 12. So 12/22 is 0.5454..., so the total is approximately 1.5454...\n\nLooking at the options, the choices are A)1.3, B)1.5, C)2.1, D)2.5, E)3.1.\n\n1.5454 is closest to 1.5, which is option B. But wait, let me check my math again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, 34 divided by 22 is the same as 17/11. Let me compute that. 11 goes into 17 once, 11, subtract, you get 6. Bring down a zero: 60. 11 goes into 60 five times (55), remainder 5. Bring down another zero: 50. 11 goes into 50 four times (44), remainder 6. So it's 1.5454..., which is approximately 1.545.\n\nLooking at the options again, 1.545 is approximately 1.5 times. So the answer should be B)1.5.\n\nWait a minute, wait. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the actual revenue ratio, not the percentage ratio. But since the problem is about the ratio of revenues, and we're using percentages, the approach should be correct because percentages are proportional to the revenue.\n\nSo yeah, the ratio is approximately 1.545, which is about 1.5 times. So the closest option is B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine how many times the revenue from novels is compared to the revenue from biographies, we start by analyzing the given data. \n\n1. **Novels' Contribution**: 34% of Ace Book Company's revenue comes from novels.  \n2. **Remaining Revenue**: The remaining revenue is \\( 100\\% - 34\\% = 66\\% \\).  \n3. **Biographies' Contribution**: Of this remaining 66%, \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) comes from biographies.
