      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about two cars starting from the same point and traveling in the same direction. Both start at the same time. The first car is going at 55 mph, and the second one at 52 mph. The question is asking how much time will pass before they're 15 miles apart. Hmm.\n\nWait, so since they're moving in the same direction, the faster car is behind the slower one and will eventually catch up. But wait, wait a second. No, wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the first car is going faster than the second. So the first car is behind the second one, right? Because they start at the same time. Oh no, no, wait, no, they're starting from the same point. So both start at the same starting line. So the first car, which is faster, will be ahead of the second car as time passes.\n\nWait, no, no. Let me think again. If both start at the same point and the first car is going 55 mph, the second 52 mph, then the first car is moving faster. So after some time, the first car would have gone further than the second. So the distance between them would be the difference in their speeds multiplied by time.\n\nOh right, because relative speed. Since they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed of the first car with respect to the second is 55 - 52 = 3 mph. So every hour, the first car gains 3 miles on the second.\n\nWait, but wait, the question is when they are 15 miles apart. So the time taken for that would be the distance divided by the relative speed. So time = 15 miles / 3 mph = 5 hours.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the answer should be 5 hours, which is option B.\n",

Both are moving in the same direction, so the first car is faster than the second. That means the distance between them will keep increasing. I need to find the time when that distance is 15 miles.\n\nLet me think about their speeds. The first is 55 mph, the second 52. So the relative speed between them is the difference, right? Because they're moving in the same direction, the faster car is leaving the slower one behind. So the relative speed is 55 - 52 = 3 mph. Oh wait, that's right. So every hour, the first car gets 3 miles ahead of the second.\n\nWait, but wait. Because they started at the same time from the same point, the initial distance between them is zero. So after time t, the distance between them will be the relative speed multiplied by time. So distance = (55 - 52) * t = 3t.\n\nWe need this distance to be 15 miles. So 3t = 15. Solving for t, t = 15 /3 = 5 hours. So the time is 5 hours. Looking at the options, option B is 5 hours. So the answer should be B.\n\nLet me double-check. In 5 hours, the first car travels 55 *5 = 275 miles. The second travels 52 *5 = 260. The difference is 15 miles. Yep, that's correct.\n",
