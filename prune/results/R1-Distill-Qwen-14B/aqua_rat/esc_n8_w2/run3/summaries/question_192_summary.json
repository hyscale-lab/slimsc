      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about the pen company's cost and profit. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand everything.\n\nThe company produces pens, and on average, 10% of them are defective and rejected before packing. They deliver 7200 pens to the wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. The company's overall profit on all manufactured pens is estimated to be 25%. I need to find the manufactured cost of each pen.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the company sells 7200 pens. But these are after the defective ones are rejected. So the 7200 is the number of good pens they send out. Since 10% are defective, that means 90% of the total produced pens are good and are delivered.\n\nWait, right. So if 10% are defective, then 90% are good. So the 7200 pens represent the 90%. Let me calculate how many pens were actually manufactured.\n\nLet me denote the total produced pens as T. Then 90% of T equals 7200. So 0.9*T = 7200. To find T, I can divide 7200 by 0.9.\n\nCalculating that: 7200 / 0.9 = 8000. So the company made 8000 pens in total. Out of these, 10% (which is 800 pens) were defective and rejected.\n\nNow, the company sells the 7200 good pens at Rs. 10 each. So the revenue from sales is 7200 * 10 = Rs. 72,000.\n\nThe profit is 25% on all the manufactured pens. Wait, so the profit is calculated on the cost of all the pens produced, not just the ones sold. Because the question says \"overall profit on all the manufactured pens.\" So profit is based on the total cost of production.\n\nLet me think about this. Profit is usually calculated as (Revenue - Cost) / Cost * 100%. So here, the profit is 25%, meaning that the revenue is 25% more than the total cost.\n\nAlternatively, Profit = 25% of Cost. So Revenue = Cost + Profit = Cost + 0.25*Cost = 1.25 * Cost.\n\nSo Revenue = 1.25 * Cost.\n\nWe have Revenue as Rs. 72,000. So,\n\n72,000 = 1.25 * Cost.\n\nTo find Cost, divide both sides by 1.25.\n\nCost = 72,000 / 1.25.\n\nLet me calculate that. 72,000 divided by 1.25.\n\nWell, 72,000 / 1.25. Let's see, 1.25 is the same as 5/4. So dividing by 5/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/5.\n\nSo 72,000 * (4/5) = (72,000 /5 ) *4.\n\n72,000 divided by 5 is 14,400. Multiply by 4: 14,400 *4 = 57,600.\n\nSo the total cost of manufacturing 8000 pens is Rs. 57,600.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the manufactured cost of each pen. So I need to find the cost per pen. That would be total cost divided by number of pens produced, which is 8000.\n\nSo 57,600 / 8000 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 8000 goes into 57,600 how many times?\n\n8000 *7=56,000. 57,600 -56,000=1,600.\n\n8000 *0.2=1,600. So 7.2 times.\n\nSo 7.2 Rs per pen.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is Rs.7.2.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Did I account for everything correctly?\n\nThe company sells 7200 pens at Rs.10 each, so revenue is 72,000.\n\nTotal cost is 57,600, which is the cost of all 8000 pens. So profit is 72,000 -57,600=14,400. \n\nProfit as a percentage of cost is (14,400 /57,600)*100% = 25%, which matches the given condition. So that seems correct.\n\nSo each pen's cost is 7.2 Rs. So the correct answer is option B.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a pen company. Hmm, let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe company produces fine pens, and on average, 10% of them are defective and get rejected. So, they don't pack those. They have to deliver 7200 pens to a wholesaler, each sold at Rs. 10. The company estimates an overall profit of 25% on all the manufactured pens. The question is asking for the manufactured cost of each pen. The options are A to E, with E being none of these.\n\nWait, I think I need to figure out the cost per pen. So, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the company sells 7200 pens. But wait, these 7200 are the ones that are good, right? Because 10% are defective. So, if 10% are defective, that means 90% are good. So, the number of pens they actually produce must be higher than 7200.\n\nLet me think: Let's say the total number of pens produced is N. Out of these, 10% are defective, so 90% are good. So, 0.9 * N = 7200. So, N = 7200 / 0.9. Let me calculate that. 7200 divided by 0.9 is 8000. So, they produce 8000 pens in total.\n\nWait, because 10% are defective, so for every 10 pens made, 9 are good. So, yes, 8000 total pens made, 7200 are good and delivered.\n\nNext, the company sells each pen for Rs. 10, and they deliver 7200. So, their revenue is 7200 * 10 = 72,000 Rs.\n\nNow, the company makes a profit of 25% on all the manufactured pens. Hmm. So, the profit is 25% of the cost. Wait, what's the cost here?\n\nLet me denote the cost per pen as C. So, the total cost for manufacturing all pens is 8000 * C.\n\nThe profit is 25% on the total cost. So, profit = 0.25 * (8000 * C).\n\nThe selling price is the total revenue, which is 72,000. But that's after subtracting the cost and adding the profit. Or wait, profit is calculated on cost. So, selling price equals cost plus profit.\n\nSo, selling price = total cost + profit.\n\nBut wait, selling price here is the revenue, which is 72,000. So:\n\n72,000 = total cost + profit\nBut profit is 25% of total cost.\n\nSo, profit = 0.25 * (8000 * C) = 2000 * C.\n\nSo, 72,000 = (8000 C) + (2000 C) = 10,000 C.\n\nWait, wait, 8000 C plus 2000 C is 10,000 C. So, 10,000 C = 72,000. So, solving for C:\n\nC = 72,000 / 10,000 = 7.2.\n\nWait, that would make the cost per pen Rs. 7.2. But wait, looking at the options, option B is 7.2. But wait, let me think again. Because the way the problem is stated, the profit is on all manufactured pens. So, the revenue is from the 7200 pens, but the cost is for all 8000 pens.\n\nSo, yes, the profit is 25% on the total cost of 8000 pens. So, the calculation seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the math again. 8000 pens, cost C each, so total cost 8000C. Profit is 25% of that, so 0.25 *8000 C = 2000 C. So, selling price (revenue) is 7200 *10=72,000.\n\nSo, revenue = cost + profit. So, 72,000 =8000 C + 2000 C. 8000+2000=10,000. 72,000=10,000 C. C=7.2. So, each pen costs Rs. 7.2. So the answer should be option B.\n\nWait, but wait. Another way to think: sometimes, profit is considered as a percentage of the selling price. But the question says the overall profit on all manufactured pens is 25%. So, profit is on cost, not on selling price. Because generally, profit margins are on cost. So, yes, the calculation is correct.\n\nSo, the cost per pen is 7.2. So, the correct option is B.\n",
