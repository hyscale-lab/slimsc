      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm supposed to find the units digit of 9^3 minus 7. Hmm, let me break it down step by step because I don't want to make a mistake.\n\nFirst, I think I should calculate 9 cubed. 9^3 means 9 multiplied by itself three times. Wait, no, actually, 9^3 is 9 multiplied by 9 multiplied by 9. Let me do that. 9 times 9 is 81, right? Then 81 times 9. Oh, what's 81 times 9? Let me calculate that. 80 times 9 is 720, and 1 times 9 is 9, so 720 plus 9 is 729. So 9^3 is 729.\n\nNow the problem says 9^3 minus 7. So that's 729 minus 7. Let me subtract that. 729 minus 7 is 722. So the result is 722.\n\nThe question asks for the units digit. The units digit is the last digit of the number. Looking at 722, the last digit is 2. So the units digit is 2.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Maybe I can check my steps again. 9 cubed is 729, yes. Subtract 7 gives 722. Units digit is 2. So looking at the options, option D is 2. That must be the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this might be to find the units digit of each part separately before subtracting. Let's see: 9^3's units digit. Well, 9 times 9 is 81, units digit is 1. Then 1 times 9 is 9, so 9^3 has a units digit of 9. Then subtract 7. Wait, but wait, that's 9 minus 7, which is 2. Oh, same result. So that's a quicker way, perhaps. That method gives the same answer, which reinforces that the units digit is 2. So the answer should be D) 2.\n",

Hmm, right, the units digit is the last digit of the number when it's written out. So I don't need to calculate the entire number, just the last digit.\n\nWait, let me break this down. The expression is 9^3 - 7. I should compute 9 cubed first and then subtract 7, but maybe there's a shortcut for just finding the units digit.\n\nI remember that when you're dealing with exponents, the units digit of the result follows a pattern that repeats every certain number of exponents.

Units digit is 9 again.\nOh, right, so the pattern for 9 is 9, 1, 9, 1, etc., repeating every two exponents.\n\nSo 9^3 would have a units digit of 9. Then I subtract 7. So 9 minus 7 is 2.
