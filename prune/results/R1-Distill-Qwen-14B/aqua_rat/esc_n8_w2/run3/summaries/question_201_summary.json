      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the rate of interest. The question says that the difference between simple interest and compound interest on Rs.5000 for 2 years is Rs.72. Hmm, I remember that simple interest is calculated as principal multiplied by rate multiplied by time, while compound interest is a bit different because it's compounded, usually annually I think. \n\nLet me write down the formulas. Simple Interest (SI) is SI = P * R * T. For this problem, P is 5000, R is the rate I'm trying to find, and T is 2 years. So SI = 5000 * R * 2 = 10000 R.\n\nCompound Interest (CI) for 2 years would be calculated as the amount minus the principal. The formula for amount with CI is P*(1 + R)^T. So CI = P*(1 + R)^2 - P. Plugging in the values, CI = 5000*( (1 + R)^2 - 1 ). \n\nThe difference between CI and SI is given as Rs.72. So, CI - SI =72. Let me write that equation:\n\n5000*( (1 + R)^2 - 1 ) - (10000 R) =72.\n\nWait, let me expand that. Let's compute each part. The CI part: 5000*(1 + 2R + R\u00b2 -1) simplifies to 5000*(2R + R\u00b2) = 10000 R + 5000 R\u00b2. Then subtract the SI which is 10000 R. So the equation becomes:\n\n(10000 R + 5000 R\u00b2) - 10000 R =72.\n\nOh, wait, the 10000R terms cancel out. So I'm left with 5000 R\u00b2 =72. \n\nHmm, solving for R\u00b2: R\u00b2 = 72 /5000. Let's compute that. 72 divided by 5000. 5000 is 5e3, 72 is 72. 72/5000 is 0.0144. So R squared is 0.0144. Taking the square root of both sides, R = sqrt(0.0144) = 0.12. Because 0.12 *0.12 is 0.0144. So R is 12%. \n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the CI formula. Oh, right, compound interest is calculated on the principal plus the accumulated interest. For two years, the amount would be P*(1+R)^2. So the CI is 5000*( (1+R)^2 -1 ), which is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the difference between CI and SI for two years is usually given by the formula P*( (R)^2 ) + P*2R*(R)/100. Wait, no, perhaps I should recall the difference formula. Oh wait, the difference between CI and SI for two years is P*( (R/100)^2 ). Because the SI is P*R*T, CI is P*(1 + R)^T - P. For two years, it's P*( (1+R)^2 -1 ) = P*(2R + R\u00b2). Subtract SI (PRT=2PR), so the difference is P R\u00b2. So the difference is 5000*(R)^2 =72. So R squared is 72/5000=0.0144. R is 12% because 0.12 squared is 0.0144. So the rate is 12%. Looking at the options, B is 12%, so that must be the answer.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about simple interest and compound interest. The question is asking for the rate of interest when the difference between SI and CI on Rs.5000 for 2 years is Rs.72. Hmm, I remember that simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount, while compound interest is calculated on the principal plus any accumulated interest from previous periods. \n\nWait, right. For SI, the formula is principal multiplied by rate multiplied by time. So SI = P * R * T. And for CI, the formula is P times (1 + R/100)^T minus P. Oh wait, for two years, it's P*(1 + R/100)^2 - P. \n\nBut the problem says the difference between CI and SI is Rs.72. So, I think the formula for the difference is CI minus SI equals 72. Let me write that down.\n\nSo, CI = P*(1 + R/100)^2 - P. And SI is P*R*T. The difference is CI - SI = 72. \n\nLet me plug in the numbers. P is 5000, T is 2, so:\n\nCI = 5000*(1 + R/100)^2 - 5000. \n\nSI = 5000 * R * 2. \n\nDifference: [5000*(1 + R/100)^2 -5000] - [5000 * R *2] =72.\n\nHmm, maybe I can simplify this equation. Let's factor out 5000. \n\n5000 [ (1 + R/100)^2 -1 ] - 5000 * 2R =72.\n\nWait, alternatively, I can factor out 5000 from both terms. Let me try that.\n\n5000 [ ( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 ) - 2R ] =72.\n\nHmm, maybe expanding (1 + R/100)^2 would help. Let's do that. \n\n(1 + R/100)^2 = 1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2.\n\nSo substituting back into the equation:\n\n5000 [ (1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2 -1) - 2R ] =72.\n\nSimplify inside the brackets: the 1 and -1 cancel out. So:\n\n5000 [ 2*(R/100) + (R^2)/(100^2) - 2R ] =72.\n\nLet me compute each term. \n\n2*(R/100) is 2R/100 = R/50.\n\n(R^2)/(10000) is R squared over ten thousand.\n\nAnd the last term is -2R.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n5000 [ (R/50) + (R\u00b2/10000) - 2R ] =72.\n\nWait, perhaps I should combine the R terms. Let's see, R/50 is 0.02R, and 2R is 2R. So R/50 - 2R is (0.02R - 2R) = (-1.98R) or -99R/50. Wait, maybe I should find a common denominator.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor R out. Let's see:\n\nInside the brackets: R (1/50 + R/(10000) - 2) \n\nWait, 1/50 is 0.02, 2 is 2. So, 0.02 + R/10000 -2 = (0.02 -2) + R/10000 = (-1.98) + R/10000. Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute each term step by step.\n\nLet me compute 2*(R/100) = 2R/100 = R/50 = 0.02R.\n\nAnd (R^2)/(100^2) is R\u00b2/10000.\n\nSo putting that together:\n\n5000 [ (0.02R + (R\u00b2)/10000) - 2R ] =72.\n\nSimplify inside the brackets: 0.02R -2R = -1.98R, and then plus R\u00b2/10000.\n\nSo now, 5000 [ (-1.98R + R\u00b2/10000) ] =72.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor R from the terms inside. So R*(-1.98 + R/10000) multiplied by 5000 equals 72.\n\nWait, let me write it as:\n\n5000 * R * ( R/10000 -1.98 ) =72.\n\nWait, but that might not be the best approach. Alternatively, I can multiply the 5000 into the terms.\n\nSo, 5000 * (-1.98 R) + 5000*(R\u00b2/10000) =72.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n5000 * (-1.98 R) = -9900 R.\n\n5000 * (R\u00b2/10000) = (5000/10000) R\u00b2 = 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nSo the equation becomes: 0.5 R\u00b2 -9900 R =72.\n\nWait, but that's a quadratic equation in R. Let me write it as:\n\n0.5 R\u00b2 -9900 R -72 =0.\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the decimal.\n\nMultiplying each term by 2:\n\nR\u00b2 - 19800 R - 144 =0.\n\nWait, that's a big quadratic equation. Let me check my calculations again because maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me go back to the earlier step where I had:\n\n5000 [ (R/50) + (R\u00b2/10000) - 2R ] =72.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute each term correctly.\n\nWait, R/50 is 0.02 R, and 2R is 2 R. So 0.02 R -2 R is -1.98 R. So the equation inside is -1.98 R + R\u00b2/10000.\n\nSo 5000 * (-1.98 R + R\u00b2/10000) =72.\n\nExpanding:\n\n5000*(-1.98 R) = -9900 R.\n\n5000*(R\u00b2/10000) = (5000/10000)*R\u00b2 = 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nSo equation is 0.5 R\u00b2 -9900 R =72.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off because the numbers are really large. Maybe I made a mistake in the expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me think about the difference between CI and SI for two years.\n\nWait, I recall that for two years, the difference between CI and SI can be calculated using the formula: P*( (R/100)^2 + 2*(R/100)*(R/100) ) * T or something else? Wait, no, perhaps the difference for two years is given by P*( (R/100)^2 + 2*(R/100) ) * T?\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the difference formula again. The difference between CI and SI for two years is P*( (R/100)^2 ) because in the first year, SI is P*R*T, and in the second year, CI includes the interest on the first year's interest.\n\nWait, let me think. For two years, the CI is P*(1+R/100)^2 - P = P*( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 ). The SI is P*R*T.\n\nSo the difference is [P*( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 ) ] - [P*R*T ].\n\nSubstituting T=2, the difference becomes:\n\nP*(1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2 -1 ) - P*R*2.\n\nSimplify inside: 2*(R/100) + (R^2)/(10000) - 2*(R/100)*P.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me compute that.\n\nThe difference is:\n\nP*(2*(R/100) + (R^2)/(10000)) - P*R*2.\n\nFactor out P*R:\n\nP*R [ 2/100 + (R)/(10000) ) ] - P*R*2.\n\nWait, perhaps I should factor P*R from the first term. So,\n\nP*R [ (2/100) + (R)/(10000) ) ] - P*R*2.\n\nWhich becomes:\n\nP*R [ (2/100 + R/10000) - 2 ].\n\nHmm, maybe that's not the easiest way. Alternatively, I can compute the difference as:\n\nP*( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 - R*T )\n\nBecause SI is P*R*T, so the difference is CI - SI = P*( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 ) - P*R*T.\n\nWhich simplifies to P [ (1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2 -1 ) - R*T ]\n\nSo, expanding:\n\nP [ 2*(R/100) + (R^2)/(10000) - R*T ]\n\nBut T is 2, so:\n\nP [ (2R/100) + R^2/(10000) - 2R ]\n\nHmm, perhaps factor R:\n\nP*R [ (2/100) + R/(10000) - 2 ]\n\nWait, but that's getting complicated. Let me plug in the numbers again.\n\nP is 5000, T is 2, and the difference is 72.\n\nSo, let's compute the difference expression:\n\n5000 [ ( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 ) - 2R ] =72.\n\nWait, let me compute (1 + R/100)^2 -1. That's 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2.\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n5000 [ 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2 - 2R ] =72.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n2*(R/100) is 0.02 R.\n\n(R/100)^2 is (R^2)/10000.\n\n2R is 2 R.\n\nSo inside the brackets:\n\n0.02 R + (R^2)/10000 - 2 R.\n\nWhich is (0.02 R - 2 R) + (R^2)/10000.\n\n0.02 R - 2 R = -1.98 R.\n\nSo now, inside the brackets: -1.98 R + (R^2)/10000.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n5000 * ( (R^2)/10000 - 1.98 R ) =72.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n5000 * (R^2)/10000 = (5000/10000) R^2 = 0.5 R^2.\n\n5000 * (-1.98 R) = -9900 R.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n0.5 R^2 - 9900 R =72.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Now, I can write it as:\n\n0.5 R^2 -9900 R -72 = 0.\n\nHmm, solving this quadratic equation for R.\n\nAlternatively, I can multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the decimal:\n\nR^2 - 19800 R - 144 = 0.\n\nHmm, that's a big equation. Let me see if I can use the quadratic formula.\n\nThe quadratic equation is R^2 -19800 R -144 =0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula: R = [19800 \u00b1 sqrt( (19800)^2 + 4 *144 ) ] / 2.\n\nWait, but 19800^2 is a huge number. Let me calculate it.\n\n19800^2 = (20000 - 200)^2 = 20000^2 - 2*20000*200 + 200^2.\n\nWhich is 400,000,000 - 8,000,000 +40,000 = 392,040,000.\n\nThen, 4*144=576.\n\nSo the discriminant is 392,040,000 + 576 = 392,040,576.\n\nThe square root of that... Hmm, let's see. Let me see what's 19800^2, which is 392,040,000. The square root of 392,040,576 would be 19800 + (576)/(2*19800) approximately, but I'm not sure if that's helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup because the numbers are way too large, and the options given are 4%, 6%, 8%, 10%, 12%, so maybe I should try each option and see which one gives a difference of 72.\n\nLet me try option D: 8% per annum.\n\nCompute SI and CI for 2 years at 8% on 5000.\n\nSI = 5000 *8% *2 = 5000 *0.08 *2 = 5000 *0.16 = 800.\n\nCI for 2 years: amount is 5000*(1.08)^2.\n\nCompute 1.08 squared: 1.08 *1.08 = 1.1664.\n\nSo amount is 5000 *1.1664 = 5832. So CI is 5832 -5000 =832.\n\nDifference is 832 -800 =32. Which is less than 72. So 8% gives a difference of 32, which is too small. So the rate must be higher.\n\nWait, let's try option B: 12%.\n\nSI: 5000 *12% *2 =5000 *0.12 *2= 5000 *0.24=1200.\n\nCI: 5000*(1.12)^2. Let's compute 1.12 squared.\n\n1.12 *1.12: 1.2544.\n\nSo 5000 *1.2544 =6272. So CI is 6272-5000=1272.\n\nDifference: 1272 -1200=72.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about simple interest and compound interest. The question is asking for the rate of interest when the difference between SI and CI on Rs.5000 for 2 years is Rs.72. Hmm, I remember that simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount, while compound interest is calculated on the principal plus any accumulated interest from previous periods. \n\nWait, right. For SI, the formula is principal multiplied by rate multiplied by time. So SI = P * R * T. And for CI, the formula is P times (1 + R/100)^T minus P. Oh wait, for two years, it's P*(1 + R/100)^2 - P. \n\nBut the problem says the difference between CI and SI is Rs.72. So, I think the formula for the difference is CI minus SI equals 72. Let me write that down.\n\nSo, CI = P*(1 + R/100)^2 - P. And SI is P*R*T. The difference is CI - SI = 72. \n\nLet me plug in the numbers. P is 5000, T is 2, so:\n\nCI = 5000*(1 + R/100)^2 - 5000. \n\nSI = 5000 * R * 2. \n\nDifference: [5000*(1 + R/100)^2 -5000] - [5000 * R *2] =72.\n\nHmm, maybe I can simplify this equation. Let's factor out 5000. \n\n5000 [ (1 + R/100)^2 -1 ] - 5000 * 2R =72.\n\nWait, alternatively, I can factor out 5000 from both terms. Let me try that.\n\n5000 [ ( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 ) - 2R ] =72.\n\nHmm, maybe expanding (1 + R/100)^2 would help. Let's do that. \n\n(1 + R/100)^2 = 1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2.\n\nSo substituting back into the equation:\n\n5000 [ (1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2 -1) - 2R ] =72.\n\nSimplify inside the brackets: the 1 and -1 cancel out. So:\n\n5000 [ 2*(R/100) + (R^2)/(100^2) - 2R ] =72.\n\nLet me compute each term. \n\n2*(R/100) is 2R/100 = R/50.\n\n(R^2)/(10000) is R squared over ten thousand.\n\nAnd the last term is -2R.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n5000 [ (R/50) + (R\u00b2/10000) - 2R ] =72.\n\nWait, perhaps I should combine the R terms. Let's see, R/50 is 0.02R, and 2R is 2R. So R/50 - 2R is (0.02R - 2R) = (-1.98R) or -99R/50. Wait, maybe I should find a common denominator.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor R out. Let's see:\n\nInside the brackets: R (1/50 + R/(10000) - 2) \n\nWait, 1/50 is 0.02, 2 is 2. So, 0.02 + R/10000 -2 = (0.02 -2) + R/10000 = (-1.98) + R/10000. Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute each term step by step.\n\nLet me compute 2*(R/100) = 2R/100 = R/50 = 0.02R.\n\nAnd (R^2)/(100^2) is R\u00b2/10000.\n\nSo putting that together:\n\n5000 [ (0.02R + (R\u00b2)/10000) - 2R ] =72.\n\nSimplify inside the brackets: 0.02R -2R = -1.98R, and then plus R\u00b2/10000.\n\nSo now, 5000 [ (-1.98R + R\u00b2/10000) ] =72.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor R from the terms inside. So R*(-1.98 + R/10000) multiplied by 5000 equals 72.\n\nWait, let me write it as:\n\n5000 * R * ( R/10000 -1.98 ) =72.\n\nWait, but that might not be the best approach. Alternatively, I can multiply the 5000 into the terms.\n\nSo, 5000 * (-1.98 R) + 5000*(R\u00b2/10000) =72.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n5000 * (-1.98 R) = -9900 R.\n\n5000 * (R\u00b2/10000) = (5000/10000) R\u00b2 = 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nSo the equation becomes: 0.5 R\u00b2 -9900 R =72.\n\nWait, but that's a quadratic equation in R. Let me write it as:\n\n0.5 R\u00b2 -9900 R -72 =0.\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the decimal.\n\nMultiplying each term by 2:\n\nR\u00b2 - 19800 R - 144 =0.\n\nWait, that's a big quadratic equation. Let me check my calculations again because maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me go back to the earlier step where I had:\n\n5000 [ (R/50) + (R\u00b2/10000) - 2R ] =72.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute each term correctly.\n\nWait, R/50 is 0.02 R, and 2R is 2 R. So 0.02 R -2 R is -1.98 R. So the equation inside is -1.98 R + R\u00b2/10000.\n\nSo 5000 * (-1.98 R + R\u00b2/10000) =72.\n\nExpanding:\n\n5000*(-1.98 R) = -9900 R.\n\n5000*(R\u00b2/10000) = (5000/10000)*R\u00b2 = 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nSo equation is 0.5 R\u00b2 -9900 R =72.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off because the numbers are really large. Maybe I made a mistake in the expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me think about the difference between CI and SI for two years.\n\nWait, I recall that for two years, the difference between CI and SI can be calculated using the formula: P*( (R/100)^2 + 2*(R/100)*(R/100) ) * T or something else? Wait, no, perhaps the difference for two years is given by P*( (R/100)^2 + 2*(R/100) ) * T?\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the difference formula again. The difference between CI and SI for two years is P*( (R/100)^2 ) because in the first year, SI is P*R*T, and in the second year, CI includes the interest on the first year's interest.\n\nWait, let me think. For two years, the CI is P*(1+R/100)^2 - P = P*( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 ). The SI is P*R*T.\n\nSo the difference is [P*( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 ) ] - [P*R*T ].\n\nSubstituting T=2, the difference becomes:\n\nP*(1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2 -1 ) - P*R*2.\n\nSimplify inside: 2*(R/100) + (R^2)/(10000) - 2*(R/100)*P.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me compute that.\n\nThe difference is:\n\nP*(2*(R/100) + (R^2)/(10000)) - P*R*2.\n\nFactor out P*R:\n\nP*R [ 2/100 + (R)/(10000) ) ] - P*R*2.\n\nWait, perhaps I should factor P*R from the first term. So,\n\nP*R [ (2/100) + (R)/(10000) ) ] - P*R*2.\n\nWhich becomes:\n\nP*R [ (2/100 + R/10000) - 2 ].\n\nHmm, maybe that's not the easiest way. Alternatively, I can compute the difference as:\n\nP*( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 - R*T )\n\nBecause SI is P*R*T, so the difference is CI - SI = P*( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 ) - P*R*T.\n\nWhich simplifies to P [ (1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2 -1 ) - R*T ]\n\nSo, expanding:\n\nP [ 2*(R/100) + (R^2)/(10000) - R*T ]\n\nBut T is 2, so:\n\nP [ (2R/100) + R^2/(10000) - 2R ]\n\nHmm, perhaps factor R:\n\nP*R [ (2/100) + R/(10000) - 2 ]\n\nWait, but that's getting complicated. Let me plug in the numbers again.\n\nP is 5000, T is 2, and the difference is 72.\n\nSo, let's compute the difference expression:\n\n5000 [ ( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 ) - 2R ] =72.\n\nWait, let me compute (1 + R/100)^2 -1. That's 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2.\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n5000 [ 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2 - 2R ] =72.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n2*(R/100) is 0.02 R.\n\n(R/100)^2 is (R^2)/10000.\n\n2R is 2 R.\n\nSo inside the brackets:\n\n0.02 R + (R^2)/10000 - 2 R.\n\nWhich is (0.02 R - 2 R) + (R^2)/10000.\n\n0.02 R - 2 R = -1.98 R.\n\nSo now, inside the brackets: -1.98 R + (R^2)/10000.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n5000 * ( (R^2)/10000 - 1.98 R ) =72.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n5000 * (R^2)/10000 = (5000/10000) R^2 = 0.5 R^2.\n\n5000 * (-1.98 R) = -9900 R.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n0.5 R^2 - 9900 R =72.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Now, I can write it as:\n\n0.5 R^2 -9900 R -72 = 0.\n\nHmm, solving this quadratic equation for R.\n\nAlternatively, I can multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the decimal:\n\nR^2 - 19800 R - 144 = 0.\n\nHmm, that's a big equation. Let me see if I can use the quadratic formula.\n\nThe quadratic equation is R^2 -19800 R -144 =0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula: R = [19800 \u00b1 sqrt( (19800)^2 + 4 *144 ) ] / 2.\n\nWait, but 19800^2 is a huge number. Let me calculate it.\n\n19800^2 = (20000 - 200)^2 = 20000^2 - 2*20000*200 + 200^2.\n\nWhich is 400,000,000 - 8,000,000 +40,000 = 392,040,000.\n\nThen, 4*144=576.\n\nSo the discriminant is 392,040,000 + 576 = 392,040,576.\n\nThe square root of that... Hmm, let's see. Let me see what's 19800^2, which is 392,040,000. The square root of 392,040,576 would be 19800 + (576)/(2*19800) approximately, but I'm not sure if that's helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup because the numbers are way too large, and the options given are 4%, 6%, 8%, 10%, 12%, so maybe I should try each option and see which one gives a difference of 72.\n\nLet me try option D: 8% per annum.\n\nCompute SI and CI for 2 years at 8% on 5000.\n\nSI = 5000 *8% *2 = 5000 *0.08 *2 = 5000 *0.16 = 800.\n\nCI for 2 years: amount is 5000*(1.08)^2.\n\nCompute 1.08 squared: 1.08 *1.08 = 1.1664.\n\nSo amount is 5000 *1.1664 = 5832. So CI is 5832 -5000 =832.\n\nDifference is 832 -800 =32. Which is less than 72. So 8% gives a difference of 32, which is too small. So the rate must be higher.\n\nWait, let's try option B: 12%.\n\nSI: 5000 *12% *2 =5000 *0.12 *2= 5000 *0.24=1200.\n\nCI: 5000*(1.12)^2. Let's compute 1.12 squared.\n\n1.12 *1.12: 1.2544.\n\nSo 5000 *1.2544 =6272. So CI is 6272-5000=1272.\n\nDifference: 1272 -1200=72. Oh, that's exactly the difference we're looking for.\n\nSo the rate is 12%.
