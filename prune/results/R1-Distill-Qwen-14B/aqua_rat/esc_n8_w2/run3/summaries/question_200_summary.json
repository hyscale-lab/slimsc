      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this probability problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, there are three friends: Alan, Roger, and Peter. They each have different probabilities of answering a question correctly. The question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. Hmm, I think that means we need to exclude any cases where Roger cheats, but include the others. Wait, let me read the question again.\n\nAlan randomly guesses, so his probability of being correct is 1/5. Roger cheats and has a 2/3 chance. Peter does his work and has a 5/6 chance. The problem is to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not through cheating. Oh, so we want the cases where either Alan or Peter got it right, but Roger didn't cheat. Or wait, maybe it's the case where someone answers correctly without cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved through either Alan's guess or Peter's work, but not Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, no, the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, it's the probability that the correct answer is given without cheating. So, if Roger answered correctly by cheating, that's not included. But if Alan or Peter answered correctly, that's included.\n\nWait, but are we considering the scenario where only one of them answers the question? Or are they all answering, and we need the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly, but Roger didn't? Or maybe the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly by someone, but not through Roger's cheating method.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me parse the question again. The question says, \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, I think that means the correct answer is achieved through a non-cheating method. So, it's the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, but not that Roger cheated and got it right.\n\nWait, but wait, the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but the method isn't cheating. So, perhaps we're looking for the probability that the correct answer comes from either Alan or Peter, but not Roger. But wait, no, maybe it's about the overall correct answer being achieved without cheating. So, perhaps we're looking for the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer could have come from either Alan or Peter, but not via Roger.\n\nWait, maybe I should model all possible scenarios. So, each of them is answering the question. The question is whether the correct answer is given, but not via cheating. So, if Roger's answer is correct, but he cheated, then that scenario is excluded. But if Alan or Peter answer correctly, regardless of how, they contribute to the correct answer. But wait, the question might be that the correct answer is achieved through someone's correct answer, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but not via Roger. Or perhaps, if the question is answered correctly, regardless of who did it, but not via cheating. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the correct answer is given, but it wasn't through Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer could be from Alan or Peter. So, the total probability is the sum of the probabilities that Alan is correct and Roger and Peter are incorrect, plus the probability that Peter is correct and Alan and Roger are incorrect, plus the probability that both Alan and Peter are correct and Roger is incorrect. Or wait, but the question is about the question being answered correctly, so perhaps it's the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly, but Roger didn't. Because if Roger answered correctly by cheating, that's the cheating route, which we want to exclude.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the question is answered correctly, but the correct answer was not obtained through cheating. So, the correct answer could have come from Alan or Peter, but not from Roger. So, we need to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. Alternatively, it could be that the correct answer was given by either Alan or Peter, but not via Roger's cheating. So, perhaps the question is considering the correctness, but the method used.\n\nWait, another approach: the probability that the question is answered correctly by someone, but that someone did not cheat. So, that would be the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, but Roger did not.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger did. Because if Roger answered correctly, that's via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nWait, perhaps the wording is that the question is answered correctly, but the method wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer could be from Alan or Peter, but not from Roger. So, the event we want is (Alan correct OR Peter correct) AND Roger incorrect.\n\nWait, no, because if Roger is correct, that's via cheating, which we want to exclude. So, the correct answer could have come from Alan or Peter, but not from Roger. But the question is about the overall correctness of the question being answered, regardless of who answered. So, perhaps the event is that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the correct answer is given, but not by Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer could have been given by Alan or Peter, but not Roger. So, the probability is (Alan correct OR Peter correct) but not Roger correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps the correct answer is given by any of them, but the correct answer is via a non-cheating method. So, if the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, that's acceptable. But if it's given by Roger via cheating, that's not acceptable. So, the total probability is the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, plus the probability that the question is answered correctly by someone else (i.e., neither Alan nor Peter, which would be Roger) but since Roger's method is cheating, we don't include that.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly, but the correct answer is not due to Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer could be from Alan or Peter. So, the probability is the probability that either Alan is correct and Roger is incorrect, or Peter is correct and Roger is incorrect. But wait, no, because if both Alan and Peter are correct, that still counts as a correct answer via non-cheating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way to model this is to calculate the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan OR Peter, regardless of what Roger did. But that's not correct because if the correct answer is given by Roger via cheating, that's excluded.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as the correct answer being given by Alan or Peter. So, the probability is the chance that either Alan is correct, or Peter is correct, but not considering Roger. Wait, but the problem states that all three are attempting the question. So, perhaps the correct answer is given by at least one of them, and we want the probability that the correct answer came from Alan or Peter, not from Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the probability that the question is answered correctly (i.e., at least one person got it right), but the correct answer was not via cheating. So, the correct answer could have been given by Alan or Peter, but not Roger. So, we need to compute the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is not correct.\n\nWait, but let me think: if the question is answered correctly, that means at least one person got it right. But we want the probability that the correct answer is given without cheating. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter. But if Roger's answer is correct, that's via cheating, which we don't want. So, perhaps the event is that either Alan is correct or Peter is correct, but not Roger. Or perhaps the event is that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan OR Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is given by someone, and that someone is not Roger. So, the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan OR Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should model the possible scenarios. Let me denote A as Alan correct, R as Roger correct, P as Peter correct.\n\nWe want the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer could be from A, R, or P. But we want to exclude any cases where R is correct because that's cheating.\n\nSo, the event we're interested in is (A correct OR P correct) AND (R incorrect). Because if R is correct, that's via cheating, which we don't want. But wait, no, because if R is correct, then the correct answer is via cheating, so we don't include that scenario. So, the overall correct answer is achieved via A or P, and R is not correct.\n\nWait, but the question is whether the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, if the correct answer comes from A or P, that's acceptable. If the correct answer comes from R, that's via cheating, which we don't want. So, the event is that the correct answer is given by A or P, and R is either correct or incorrect, but the correct answer is from A or P.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: The total probability of the question being answered correctly is the probability that at least one of A, R, or P is correct. But we want the probability that the correct answer is achieved without cheating, which means it's achieved via A or P. So, the probability that the question is correctly answered, but not via R.\n\nSo, the desired probability is P(A correct OR P correct) minus the probability that R correct, but that's not the way. Alternatively, perhaps it's P(A correct OR P correct) minus the probability that (A correct OR P correct) AND R correct. Because if R is correct, that's via cheating, so we don't want that scenario. Wait, no, because if R is correct, the correct answer is via cheating, so we don't count that case. So, the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by A or P, regardless of R's outcome, but then exclude the cases where R is correct. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not through R's cheating. So, the correct answer could come from A or P, and R is either correct or incorrect. Wait, but if R is correct, that's via cheating, so we don't want that. So, the correct scenario is that the question is answered correctly, but not by R. So, the question is correct, and R is incorrect.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The problem is that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer could have come from A or P, but not R. So, the event is that either A or P is correct, but R is not correct.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because the question is about the correctness of the answer, regardless of who gave it. So, if A is correct, the answer is correct. If R is correct, via cheating, the answer is correct. But the problem wants the probability that the answer is correct, but it's not via cheating. So, we need to exclude the cases where the correct answer is via R's cheating.\n\nSo, the desired probability is the probability that the question is answered correctly by A or P, but not by R. Wait, but if R is correct, that's a correct answer via cheating, which we want to exclude. So, the event is that the question is answered correctly by either A or P, regardless of R. Or, perhaps, the correct answer is given by A or P, and R is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to calculate the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not by R. So, the correct answer could be from A or P, and R is incorrect. So, the probability is P(A correct OR P correct) minus P(A correct OR P correct AND R correct). Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the probability is P(A correct OR P correct) multiplied by (1 - P(R correct)).\n\nWait, but no, because A, R, and P are independent events. So, the probability that the question is answered correctly by A or P, and R is not correct. So, the probability that A is correct OR P is correct, but R is incorrect.\n\nSo, the formula would be P(A \u222a P) * P(R^c), where R^c is the complement of R. Wait, but that's only true if A, P, and R are independent, which they are because each person's answer is independent of the others.\n\nSo, let me compute P(A \u222a P) first. Since A and P are independent, P(A \u222a P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A) * P(P). Because when you have two independent events, the probability of their union is the sum minus the product.\n\nSo, P(A) is 1/5, P(P) is 5/6.\n\nP(A \u222a P) = 1/5 + 5/6 - (1/5)(5/6) = let's calculate that.\n\n1/5 is 0.2, 5/6 is approximately 0.8333.\n\nAdding them gives about 1.0333, but then subtracting the product (1/5 *5/6)= 1/6 \u2248 0.1667.\n\nSo, 0.2 + 0.8333 = 1.0333, minus 0.1667 gives about 0.8666, which is 5/6 + 1/5 - 1/6 = let's compute it exactly.\n\nCompute 1/5 +5/6 = (6 +25)/30 = 31/30. Then subtract (1/5)(5/6)=5/30=1/6. So, 31/30 - 1/6 = 31/30 -5/30= 26/30=13/15.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 1/5 is 0.2, 5/6 is ~0.8333. The union is 0.2 + 0.8333 - (0.2 * 0.8333) = 0.2 + 0.8333 = 1.0333 minus 0.1666, which is approximately 0.8667. Which is 13/15 \u22480.8667.\n\nSo, P(A \u222a P) =13/15.\n\nThen, the probability that R is incorrect is (1 - 2/3) =1/3.\n\nSo, the desired probability is P(A \u222a P) * P(R^c) = (13/15) * (1/3) =13/45.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Is that correct? Because the events A, P, R are all independent. So, the probability that A or P is correct and R is incorrect is equal to P(A \u222a P) multiplied by P(R^c) because they're independent? Or is it not? Because if R is incorrect, that's independent of A and P.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that (A correct OR P correct) AND R incorrect. Since A, P, and R are independent, this would be P(A OR P) * P(R^c) = 13/15 * 1/3 =13/45.\n\nBut wait, another approach: the probability that the correct answer is given by A or P, and R is not correct. So, all possible scenarios where A is correct, P is correct, or both, but R is incorrect.\n\nSo, the formula is P(A \u222a P) * P(R^c). But wait, is that correct?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute it as:\n\nP(A correct and R incorrect) + P(P correct and R incorrect) - P(A correct and P correct and R incorrect).\n\nBecause when both A and P are correct, we have to subtract the overlap to avoid double-counting.\n\nSo, let me compute each term.\n\nP(A correct and R incorrect) = P(A) * P(R^c) = (1/5) * (1/3) =1/15.\n\nP(P correct and R incorrect) = P(P) * P(R^c) = (5/6) * (1/3) =5/18.\n\nP(A correct and P correct and R incorrect) = P(A) * P(P) * P(R^c) = (1/5)*(5/6)*(1/3) = (1/5)*(5/6)=1/6, multiplied by 1/3 gives 1/18.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nP(A \u222a P correct and R incorrect) = (1/15) + (5/18) - (1/18).\n\nCompute 1/15 is 6/90, 5/18 is 25/90, and 1/18 is 5/90.\n\nSo, 6/90 +25/90 =31/90, minus 5/90 gives 26/90, which simplifies to 13/45.\n\nHmm, so both methods give the same result, 13/45.\n\nLooking back at the options, option E is 13/45. So, the correct answer should be E.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Another way to think about it: the probability that the question is answered correctly without cheating is the sum of the probabilities where either Alan is correct and Roger is incorrect, or Peter is correct and Roger is incorrect, minus the overlap where both are correct and Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo, that's exactly what I did earlier, and the result was 13/45.\n\nSo, the answer should be option E.\n",

The problem is that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer could have come from A or P, but not R. So, the event is that either A or P is correct, but R is not correct.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because the question is about the correctness of the answer, regardless of who gave it. So, if A is correct, the answer is correct. If R is correct, via cheating, the answer is correct. But the problem wants the probability that the answer is correct, but it's not via cheating. So, we need to exclude the cases where the correct answer is via R's cheating.\n\nSo, the desired probability is the probability that the question is answered correctly by A or P, but not by R. Wait, but if R is correct, that's a correct answer via cheating, which we want to exclude. So, the event is that the question is answered correctly by either A or P, regardless of R. Or, perhaps, the correct answer is given by A or P, and R is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to calculate the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not by R. So, the correct answer could be from A or P, and R is incorrect. So, the probability is P(A correct OR P correct) minus P(A correct OR P correct AND R correct). Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the probability is P(A correct OR P correct) multiplied by (1 - P(R correct)).\n\nWait, but no, because A, R, and P are independent events. So, the probability that the question is answered correctly by A or P, and R is not correct. So, the probability that A is correct OR P is correct, but R is incorrect.\n\nSo, the formula would be P(A \u222a P) * P(R^c), where R^c is the complement of R. Wait, but that's only true if A, P, and R are independent, which they are because each person's answer is independent of the others.\n\nSo, let me compute P(A \u222a P) first. Since A and P are independent, P(A \u222a P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A) * P(P). Because when you have two independent events, the probability of their union is the sum minus the product.\n\nSo, P(A) is 1/5, P(P) is 5/6.\n\nP(A \u222a P) = 1/5 + 5/6 - (1/5)(5/6) = let's calculate that.\n\n1/5 is 0.2, 5/6 is approximately 0.8333.\n\nAdding them gives about 1.0333, but then subtracting the product (1/5 *5/6)= 1/6 \u2248 0.1667.\n\nSo, 0.2 + 0.8333 = 1.0333, minus 0.1667 gives about 0.8666, which is 5/6 + 1/5 - 1/6 = let's compute it exactly.\n\nCompute 1/5 +5/6 = (6 +25)/30 = 31/30. Then subtract (1/5)(5/6)=5/30=1/6. So, 31/30 - 1/6 = 31/30 -5/30= 26/30=13/15.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 1/5 is 0.2, 5/6 is ~0.8333. The union is 0.2 + 0.8333 - (0.2 * 0.8333) = 0.2 + 0.8333 = 1.0333 minus 0.1666, which is approximately 0.8667. Which is 13/15 \u22480.8667.\n\nSo, P(A \u222a P) =13/15.\n\nThen, the probability that R is incorrect is (1 - 2/3) =1/3.\n\nSo, the desired probability is P(A \u222a P) * P(R^c) = (13/15) * (1/3) =13/45.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Is that correct? Because the events A, P, R are all independent. So, the probability that A or P is correct and R is incorrect is equal to P(A \u222a P) multiplied by P(R^c) because they're independent? Or is it not? Because if R is incorrect, that's independent of A and P.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that (A correct OR P correct) AND R incorrect. Since A, P, and R are independent, this would be P(A OR P) * P(R^c) = 13/15 * 1/3 =13/45.\n\nBut wait, another approach: the probability that the correct answer is given by A or P, and R is not correct. So, all possible scenarios where A is correct, P is correct, or both, but R is incorrect.\n\nSo, the formula is P(A \u222a P) * P(R^c). But wait, is that correct?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute it as:\n\nP(A correct and R incorrect) + P(P correct and R incorrect) - P(A correct and P correct and R incorrect).\n\nBecause when both A and P are correct, we have to subtract the overlap to avoid double-counting.\n\nSo, let me compute each term.\n\nP(A correct and R incorrect) = P(A) * P(R^c) = (1/5) * (1/3) =1/15.\n\nP(P correct and R incorrect) = P(P) * P(R^c) = (5/6) * (1/3) =5/18.\n\nP(A correct and P correct and R incorrect) = P(A) * P(P) * P(R^c) = (1/5)*(5/6)*(1/3) = (1/5)*(5/6)=1/6, multiplied by 1/3 gives 1/18.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nP(A \u222a P correct and R incorrect) = (1/15) + (5/18) - (1/18).\n\nCompute 1/15 is 6/90, 5/18 is 25/90, and 1/18 is 5/90.\n\nSo, 6/90 +25/90 =31/90, minus 5/90 gives 26/90, which simplifies to 13/45.\n\nHmm, so both methods give the same result, 13/45.\n\nLooking back at the options, option E is 13/45. So, the correct answer should be E.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Another way to think about it: the probability that the question is answered correctly without cheating is the sum of the probabilities where either Alan is correct and Roger is incorrect, or Peter is correct and Roger is incorrect, minus the overlap where both are correct and Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo, that's exactly what I did earlier, and the result was 13/45.\n\nSo, the answer should be option E.\n\n\nTo determine the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating, we need to consider the contributions from Alan and Peter, while excluding any cases where Roger cheats and answers correctly. The events are independent, and the probabilities are as follows:\n\n- Alan's probability of answering correctly: \\( P(A) = \\frac{1}{5} \\)\n- Roger's probability of answering correctly (via cheating): \\( P(R) = \\frac{2}{3} \\)\n- Peter's probability of answering correctly: \\( P(P) = \\frac{5}{6} \\)\n\n### Step 1: Compute \\( P(A \\cup P) \\)\nThe probability that either Alan or Peter answers correctly is given by:\n\\[\nP(A \\cup P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A) \\cdot P(P)\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\nP(A \\cup P) = \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{5}{6} - \\left(\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{5}{6}\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\nP(A \\cup P) = \\frac{6}{30} + \\frac{25}{30} - \\frac{5}{30}\n\\]\n\\[\nP(A \\cup P) = \\frac{26}{30} = \\frac{13}{15}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Compute \\( P(R^c) \\)\nThe probability that Roger does not answer correctly (i.e., does not cheat successfully) is:\n\\[\nP(R^c) = 1 - P(R) = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Compute the desired probability\nThe probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating is:\n\\[\nP(\\text{Correct answer not via cheating}) = P(A \\cup P) \\cdot P(R^c)\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\nP(\\text{Correct answer not via cheating}) = \\frac{13}{15} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\nP(\\text{Correct answer not via cheating}) = \\frac{13}{45}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating is \\( \\frac{13}{45} \\).\n\nAnswer: E",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's read it again.\n\nThere are three friends: Alan, Roger, and Peter. They're answering a question on an exam, and each has a different probability of getting it right. The question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. Oh wait, so we need the correct answer, but without considering any cheating. So, we're looking for the cases where either Alan or Peter got it right, but Roger's correct answer is via cheating, which we don't count.\n\nLet me break down the probabilities:\n\n- Alan's probability of guessing correctly is 1/5. That's 0.2. So, he has a 1/5 chance of being right, and 4/5 chance of being wrong.\n\n- Roger cheats, so his probability of answering correctly is 2/3. But wait, we're supposed to exclude cases where he answers correctly because he cheated. So, any time Roger gets it right, that's via cheating, and we don't want that. So, in our desired event, Roger must not have answered correctly.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, the correct answer could be from Alan or Peter, but not from Roger's cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is from either Alan or Peter, and Roger's answer is incorrect, or maybe the correct answer comes from either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's action? Wait, no. The question is whether the correct answer was achieved without cheating. So, I think we need to calculate the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, but not Roger. Because if Roger answered correctly via cheating, that's not counted as a non-cheating correct answer.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. The total correct answer could be from any of the three, but we want the cases where it's correct but not because of Roger's cheating. So, perhaps the event is that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not via Roger.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by someone other than Roger cheating. So, the correct answer is either by Alan or Peter, and the other (Roger) is wrong. Or maybe the correct answer is by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's action.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model all possible scenarios. Let me think: the question is answered correctly. So, one of them got it right. But we want the case where the correct answer came from someone not cheating, i.e., either Alan or Peter. So, the correct answer is either by Alan or Peter, and Roger's answer is incorrect, but wait, no, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The question is answered correctly. So, the correct answer is achieved by at least one of them. But we need the probability that this correct answer was not achieved via cheating. So, the correct answer was achieved by either Alan or Peter, and not via Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, but how do their answers relate? Are they all answering the same question, and the correct answer is the one given by the exam, right? So, the correct answer is the one that matches the exam's correct answer. So, each of them has their own probability of being correct.\n\nBut the way the question is phrased, I think it's asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly (i.e., at least one person got it right), but that the correct answer was not via cheating. So, the correct answer came from either Alan or Peter, but not from Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, maybe I should model this as the probability that the question is correct, but the correct answer came from either Alan or Peter, not Roger. Because if Roger is the one who got it right via cheating, then that's a correct answer via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nSo, the problem can be broken down into two parts:\n\n1. The probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter.\n\n2. But we also have to account for the possibility that all three got it right, but since Roger's method is cheating, we need to exclude his contribution.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: The correct answer is achieved, but it's not through Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer could be from Alan or Peter, but not from Roger's correct answer.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by someone, but that someone is not a cheater (i.e., not Roger). So, the correct answer must have come from Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's phrased as \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, it's about the method of answering correctly. So, if the correct answer is achieved via cheating (Roger), then it's excluded. So, the correct answer must have come from Alan or Peter, meaning either Alan got it right or Peter got it right, but Roger did not.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is that the correct answer is achieved, and we want the probability that it was not via cheating. So, the correct answer came from either Alan or Peter. But wait, in reality, the correct answer is the same for all of them. So, the correct answer is either Alan got it right, or Peter got it right, or Roger got it right via cheating. So, the probability that the correct answer was achieved, but not via cheating, is the probability that either Alan or Peter got it right, minus the cases where all three got it right, but wait, perhaps that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved, and the correct answer came from either Alan or Peter. Because if the correct answer came from Roger, that's via cheating and is excluded.\n\nWait, but how can we model this? Let me think about all possible scenarios where the question is answered correctly.\n\nThe question is answered correctly if at least one of them got it right. But we are to find the probability that the correct answer was achieved without cheating, which means that the correct answer is from either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is phrased is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read the question.\n\n\"What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?\"\n\nAh, perhaps the intended meaning is that the question is answered correctly, but the correct answer was achieved without cheating. So, the correct answer was provided by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger answered correctly or not. Wait, no, because if all three answer correctly, then the correct answer was provided by all three, including Roger via cheating, which we need to exclude.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the problem as: the correct answer is achieved, but the correct answer was not obtained through cheating (i.e., not by Roger). So, the correct answer must have come from either Alan or Peter. So, the correct answer could be from Alan, from Peter, or from both, but not from Roger.\n\nBut how do we model that? Let me think in terms of events.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nA: Alan answers correctly.\n\nR: Roger answers correctly (via cheating).\n\nP: Peter answers correctly.\n\nWe are to find the probability that the correct answer is achieved (i.e., at least one of A, R, P is true) but that the correct answer was not via cheating. So, the correct answer must have come from either A or P, but not via R.\n\nWait, but if the correct answer is achieved via R, then it's via cheating and we need to exclude that scenario. So, the correct answer is achieved via either A or P, but not via R. So, the probability we're looking for is the probability that the correct answer is achieved by A or P, but not by R.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased as \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating,\" which could mean that the correct answer was not achieved via cheating. So, the correct answer came from Alan or Peter, but not Roger.\n\nSo, the way to calculate this is:\n\nThe probability that the correct answer is achieved (i.e., at least one of A, R, or P is correct) minus the probability that the correct answer was achieved via cheating (i.e., R is correct, regardless of A and P). But wait, that might not be correct because if multiple people are correct, we have overlapping events.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, but Roger did not. Because if Roger didn't answer correctly, then the correct answer, if any, came from Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if Roger didn't answer correctly, then any correct answer must have come from Alan or Peter. So, the event we want is (A or P is correct) AND (R is incorrect). So, the probability is P((A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR).\n\nBut wait, no. Because the event we're interested in is that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the question is answered correctly, which means at least one of A, R, or P is correct. But it's not via cheating, so the correct answer(s) must have come from A or P. So, the correct answer(s) must have come from A or P, and R is not correct.\n\nWait, but if R is correct, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which we don't want. So, the correct answer must have been achieved by A or P, and R must not have answered correctly.\n\nSo, the event is (A or P) is correct AND R is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, the question is answered correctly, meaning that at least one of A, R, or P is correct. But we need to exclude the cases where the correct answer was achieved via R. So, the event is that the question is correct, and the correct answer came from A or P, regardless of R's answer. Wait, but if R is correct, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which we don't want. So, the correct answer must not have come from R.\n\nTherefore, the correct scenario is that either A or P is correct, and R is incorrect. Because if R is correct, then the correct answer is via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nWait, but what if both A and P are correct and R is incorrect? Then the correct answer is achieved by both, and it's via non-cheating. So, that's acceptable.\n\nSo, the probability we're looking for is the probability that (A \u2228 P) is correct AND R is incorrect.\n\nSo, let's model this as P(A \u2228 P) AND \u00acR.\n\nWait, but how do we compute this?\n\nAlternatively, since R is incorrect, the probability is:\n\nP(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR)\n\nWait, no, because A and P are independent events, as are R and their events.\n\nWait, no, because the events are independent. So, P(A or P) is the probability that either Alan or Peter answers correctly. And P(\u00acR) is the probability that Roger does not answer correctly.\n\nBut wait, the events are independent, so the probability that (A or P is correct) and (R is incorrect) is P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR). Wait, no, because (A \u2228 P) and \u00acR are not necessarily independent. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, the correct way is to compute the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger did not. So, the event is (A \u2228 P) AND (\u00acR).\n\nSo, to compute this, we can think of it as:\n\nP(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR) - but wait, no, because (A \u2228 P) and (\u00acR) are not independent. So, perhaps it's better to model it as:\n\nP( (A \u2228 P) and \u00acR ) = P( (A \u2228 P) and \u00acR )\n\nWhich is the same as P( (A and \u00acR) or (P and \u00acR) ), because (A \u2228 P) and \u00acR can be written as (A and \u00acR) \u2228 (P and \u00acR), since A and P are independent of R.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute this using inclusion-exclusion.\n\nBut maybe another approach is better. Let me think: the probability that (A or P) is correct, and R is incorrect.\n\nSo, P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P(A \u2228 P) - P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 R )\n\nWait, no, perhaps not. Alternatively, we can compute it as:\n\nP( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P( (A \u2228 P) ) * P(\u00acR | A \u2228 P )\n\nBut since A, P, and R are independent, because each person's success is independent, the probability that R is incorrect is independent of A and P.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because R's correctness is independent of A and P. So, events A, P, and R are independent.\n\nSo, P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR) ?\n\nWait, no, because (A \u2228 P) and R are independent? Not necessarily. Wait, if A and P are independent of R, then (A \u2228 P) is independent of R. Because if A and P are independent of R, then any function of A and P is also independent of R.\n\nWait, yes, because if A and R are independent, and P and R are independent, then (A \u2228 P) and R are also independent. Because the probability of R doesn't depend on whether A or P occur.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR)\n\nSo, let's compute P(A \u2228 P) first.\n\nP(A \u2228 P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A)P(P) (since A and P are independent)\n\nP(A) is 1/5, P(P) is 5/6.\n\nSo, P(A \u2228 P) = 1/5 + 5/6 - (1/5)(5/6) = ?\n\nCalculating:\n\n1/5 is 0.2, 5/6 is approximately 0.8333.\n\nSo, 0.2 + 0.8333 = 1.0333. Then subtract (0.2 * 0.8333) = 0.16666.\n\nSo, 1.0333 - 0.16666 = 0.86664, which is 13/15 (since 13/15 is 0.8666...).\n\nWait, let me compute it exactly.\n\n1/5 is 6/30, 5/6 is 25/30.\n\nSo, 6/30 +25/30 =31/30. But wait, that's more than 1, which is impossible. Oh, because when you have 1/5 +5/6, that's (6+25)/30 = 31/30, which is greater than 1, but since they are probabilities, you can't have that. So, the inclusion-exclusion formula corrects this.\n\nSo, 1/5 +5/6 - (1/5)(5/6) = [ (6 +25)/30 ] - (5/(5*6)) ?\n\nWait, 1/5 *5/6 = (1*5)/(5*6) = 5/(30) = 1/6.\n\nSo, P(A \u2228 P) = 31/30 - 1/6 = (31/30) - (5/30) )= 26/30 = 13/15.\n\nSo, P(A \u2228 P) = 13/15.\n\nAnd P(\u00acR) is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nSo, since (A \u2228 P) and R are independent, P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR) = (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/45.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Is that correct? Because the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, if the correct answer is achieved via either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer, but only when Roger didn't answer correctly.\n\nWait, but if the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, but Roger also answered correctly via cheating, then the correct answer is achieved both via non-cheating and cheating. So, in that case, the correct answer was achieved via cheating as well, which we are supposed to exclude.\n\nWait, no. The question is about the correct answer being achieved without cheating. So, if the correct answer is achieved via both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer is achieved via cheating as well. So, we need to exclude any scenario where the correct answer was achieved via Roger.\n\nSo, the event we want is the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, and not via Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved via either Alan or Peter, and not via Roger.\n\nWait, but if all three are correct, including Roger, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating, so that scenario should not be counted.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and Roger is not correct. Because if Roger is correct, the correct answer is via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR), which is 13/15 * 1/3 = 13/45.\n\nBut let me check the options. The options are:\n\nA) 1/18\n\nB)1/9\n\nC)23/90\n\nD)5/18\n\nE)13/45\n\nSo, option E is 13/45, which matches our calculation.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose that the correct answer is achieved by both Alan and Peter, and Roger is incorrect. Then, the correct answer was achieved by non-cheaters, which is acceptable.\n\nBut if the correct answer is achieved by Alan and Roger, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating, so we should exclude that scenario.\n\nSo, our initial approach computes the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger did not.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's read it again.\n\nThere are three friends: Alan, Roger, and Peter. They're answering a question on an exam, and each has a different probability of getting it right. The question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. Oh wait, so we need the correct answer, but without considering any cheating. So, we're looking for the cases where either Alan or Peter got it right, but Roger's correct answer is via cheating, which we don't count.\n\nLet me break down the probabilities:\n\n- Alan's probability of guessing correctly is 1/5. That's 0.2. So, he has a 1/5 chance of being right, and 4/5 chance of being wrong.\n\n- Roger cheats, so his probability of answering correctly is 2/3. But wait, we're supposed to exclude cases where he answers correctly because he cheated. So, any time Roger gets it right, that's via cheating, and we don't want that. So, in our desired event, Roger must not have answered correctly.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, the correct answer could be from Alan or Peter, but not from Roger's cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is from either Alan or Peter, and Roger's answer is incorrect, or maybe the correct answer comes from either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's action? Wait, no. The question is whether the correct answer was achieved without cheating. So, I think we need to calculate the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, but not Roger. Because if Roger answered correctly via cheating, that's not counted as a non-cheating correct answer.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. The total correct answer could be from any of the three, but we want the cases where it's correct but not because of Roger's cheating. So, perhaps the event is that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not via Roger.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by someone other than Roger cheating. So, the correct answer is either by Alan or Peter, and the other (Roger) is wrong. Or maybe the correct answer is by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's action.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model all possible scenarios. Let me think: the question is answered correctly. So, one of them got it right. But we want the case where the correct answer came from someone not cheating, i.e., either Alan or Peter. So, the correct answer is either by Alan or Peter, and Roger's answer is incorrect, but wait, no, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The question is answered correctly. So, the correct answer is achieved by at least one of them. But we need the probability that this correct answer was not achieved via cheating. So, the correct answer was achieved by either Alan or Peter, and not via Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, but how do their answers relate? Are they all answering the same question, and the correct answer is the one given by the exam, right? So, the correct answer is the one that matches the exam's correct answer. So, each of them has their own probability of being correct.\n\nBut the way the question is phrased, I think it's asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly (i.e., at least one person got it right), but that the correct answer was not via cheating. So, the correct answer came from either Alan or Peter, but not from Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, maybe I should model this as the probability that the question is correct, but the correct answer came from either Alan or Peter, not Roger. Because if Roger is the one who got it right via cheating, then that's a correct answer via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nSo, the problem can be broken down into two parts:\n\n1. The probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter.\n\n2. But we also have to account for the possibility that all three got it right, but since Roger's method is cheating, we need to exclude his contribution.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: The correct answer is achieved, but it's not through Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer could be from Alan or Peter, but not from Roger's correct answer.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by someone, but that someone is not a cheater (i.e., not Roger). So, the correct answer must have come from Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's phrased as \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, it's about the method of answering correctly. So, if the correct answer is achieved via cheating (Roger), then it's excluded. So, the correct answer must have come from Alan or Peter, meaning either Alan got it right or Peter got it right, but Roger did not.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is that the correct answer is achieved, and we want the probability that it was not via cheating. So, the correct answer came from either Alan or Peter. But wait, in reality, the correct answer is the same for all of them. So, the correct answer is either Alan got it right, or Peter got it right, or Roger got it right via cheating. So, the probability that the correct answer was achieved, but not via cheating, is the probability that either Alan or Peter got it right, minus the cases where all three got it right, but wait, perhaps that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved, and the correct answer came from either Alan or Peter. Because if the correct answer came from Roger, that's via cheating and is excluded.\n\nWait, but how can we model this? Let me think about all possible scenarios where the question is answered correctly.\n\nThe question is answered correctly if at least one of them got it right. But we are to find the probability that the correct answer was achieved without cheating, which means that the correct answer is from either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is phrased is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read the question.\n\n\"What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?\"\n\nAh, perhaps the intended meaning is that the question is answered correctly, but the correct answer was achieved without cheating. So, the correct answer was provided by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger answered correctly or not. Wait, no, because if all three answer correctly, then the correct answer was provided by all three, including Roger via cheating, which we need to exclude.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the problem as: the correct answer is achieved, but the correct answer was not obtained through cheating (i.e., not by Roger). So, the correct answer must have come from either Alan or Peter. So, the correct answer could be from Alan, from Peter, or from both, but not from Roger.\n\nBut how do we model that? Let me think in terms of events.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nA: Alan answers correctly.\n\nR: Roger answers correctly (via cheating).\n\nP: Peter answers correctly.\n\nWe are to find the probability that the correct answer is achieved (i.e., at least one of A, R, P is true) but that the correct answer was not via cheating. So, the correct answer must have come from either A or P, but not via R.\n\nWait, but if the correct answer is achieved via R, then it's via cheating and we need to exclude that scenario. So, the correct answer is achieved via either A or P, but not via R. So, the probability we're looking for is the probability that the correct answer is achieved by A or P, but not by R.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased as \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating,\" which could mean that the correct answer was not achieved via cheating. So, the correct answer came from Alan or Peter, but not Roger.\n\nSo, the way to calculate this is:\n\nThe probability that the correct answer is achieved (i.e., at least one of A, R, or P is correct) minus the probability that the correct answer was achieved via cheating (i.e., R is correct, regardless of A and P). But wait, that might not be correct because if multiple people are correct, we have overlapping events.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, but Roger did not. Because if Roger didn't answer correctly, then the correct answer, if any, came from Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if Roger didn't answer correctly, then any correct answer must have come from Alan or Peter. So, the event we want is (A or P is correct) AND (R is incorrect). So, the probability is P((A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR).\n\nBut wait, no. Because the event we're interested in is that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the question is answered correctly, which means at least one of A, R, or P is correct. But it's not via cheating, so the correct answer(s) must have come from A or P. So, the correct answer(s) must have come from A or P, and R is not correct.\n\nWait, but if R is correct, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which we don't want. So, the correct answer must have been achieved by A or P, and R must not have answered correctly.\n\nSo, the event is (A or P) is correct AND R is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, the question is answered correctly, meaning that at least one of A, R, or P is correct. But we need to exclude the cases where the correct answer was achieved via R. So, the event is that the question is correct, and the correct answer came from A or P, regardless of R's answer. Wait, but if R is correct, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which we don't want. So, the correct answer must not have come from R.\n\nTherefore, the correct scenario is that either A or P is correct, and R is incorrect. Because if R is correct, then the correct answer is via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nWait, but what if both A and P are correct and R is incorrect? Then the correct answer is achieved by both, and it's via non-cheating. So, that's acceptable.\n\nSo, the probability we're looking for is the probability that (A \u2228 P) is correct AND R is incorrect.\n\nSo, let's model this as P(A \u2228 P) AND \u00acR.\n\nWait, but how do we compute this?\n\nAlternatively, since R is incorrect, the probability is:\n\nP(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR)\n\nWait, no, because A and P are independent events, as are R and their events.\n\nWait, no, because the events are independent. So, P(A or P) is the probability that either Alan or Peter answers correctly. And P(\u00acR) is the probability that Roger does not answer correctly.\n\nBut wait, the events are independent, so the probability that (A or P is correct) and (R is incorrect) is P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR). Wait, no, because (A \u2228 P) and \u00acR are not necessarily independent. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, the correct way is to compute the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger did not. So, the event is (A \u2228 P) AND (\u00acR).\n\nSo, to compute this, we can think of it as:\n\nP(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR) - but wait, no, because (A \u2228 P) and (\u00acR) are not independent. So, perhaps it's better to model it as:\n\nP( (A \u2228 P) and \u00acR ) = P( (A \u2228 P) and \u00acR )\n\nWhich is the same as P( (A and \u00acR) or (P and \u00acR) ), because (A \u2228 P) and \u00acR can be written as (A and \u00acR) \u2228 (P and \u00acR), since A and P are independent of R.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute this using inclusion-exclusion.\n\nBut maybe another approach is better. Let me think: the probability that (A or P) is correct, and R is incorrect.\n\nSo, P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P(A \u2228 P) - P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 R )\n\nWait, no, perhaps not. Alternatively, we can compute it as:\n\nP( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P( (A \u2228 P) ) * P(\u00acR | A \u2228 P )\n\nBut since A, P, and R are independent, because each person's success is independent, the probability that R is incorrect is independent of A and P.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because R's correctness is independent of A and P. So, events A, P, and R are independent.\n\nSo, P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR) ?\n\nWait, no, because (A \u2228 P) and R are independent? Not necessarily. Wait, if A and P are independent of R, then (A \u2228 P) is independent of R. Because if A and P are independent of R, then any function of A and P is also independent of R.\n\nWait, yes, because if A and R are independent, and P and R are independent, then (A \u2228 P) and R are also independent. Because the probability of R doesn't depend on whether A or P occur.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR)\n\nSo, let's compute P(A \u2228 P) first.\n\nP(A \u2228 P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A)P(P) (since A and P are independent)\n\nP(A) is 1/5, P(P) is 5/6.\n\nSo, P(A \u2228 P) = 1/5 + 5/6 - (1/5)(5/6) = ?\n\nCalculating:\n\n1/5 is 0.2, 5/6 is approximately 0.8333.\n\nSo, 0.2 + 0.8333 = 1.0333. Then subtract (0.2 * 0.8333) = 0.16666.\n\nSo, 1.0333 - 0.16666 = 0.86664, which is 13/15 (since 13/15 is 0.8666...).\n\nWait, let me compute it exactly.\n\n1/5 is 6/30, 5/6 is 25/30.\n\nSo, 6/30 +25/30 =31/30. But wait, that's more than 1, which is impossible. Oh, because when you have 1/5 +5/6, that's (6+25)/30 = 31/30, which is greater than 1, but since they are probabilities, you can't have that. So, the inclusion-exclusion formula corrects this.\n\nSo, 1/5 +5/6 - (1/5)(5/6) = [ (6 +25)/30 ] - (5/(5*6)) ?\n\nWait, 1/5 *5/6 = (1*5)/(5*6) = 5/(30) = 1/6.\n\nSo, P(A \u2228 P) = 31/30 - 1/6 = (31/30) - (5/30) )= 26/30 = 13/15.\n\nSo, P(A \u2228 P) = 13/15.\n\nAnd P(\u00acR) is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nSo, since (A \u2228 P) and R are independent, P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR) = (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/45.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Is that correct? Because the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, if the correct answer is achieved via either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer, but only when Roger didn't answer correctly.\n\nWait, but if the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, but Roger also answered correctly via cheating, then the correct answer is achieved both via non-cheating and cheating. So, in that case, the correct answer was achieved via cheating as well, which we are supposed to exclude.\n\nWait, no. The question is about the correct answer being achieved without cheating. So, if the correct answer is achieved via both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer is achieved via cheating as well. So, we need to exclude any scenario where the correct answer was achieved via Roger.\n\nSo, the event we want is the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, and not via Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved via either Alan or Peter, and not via Roger.\n\nWait, but if all three are correct, including Roger, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating, so that scenario should not be counted.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and Roger is not correct. Because if Roger is correct, the correct answer is via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR), which is 13/15 * 1/3 = 13/45.\n\nBut let me check the options. The options are:\n\nA) 1/18\n\nB)1/9\n\nC)23/90\n\nD)5/18\n\nE)13/45\n\nSo, option E is 13/45, which matches our calculation.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose that the correct answer is achieved by both Alan and Peter, and Roger is incorrect. Then, the correct answer was achieved by non-cheaters, which is acceptable.\n\nBut if the correct answer is achieved by Alan and Roger, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating, so we should exclude that scenario.\n\nSo, our initial approach computes the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger did not. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 13/45, which is option E.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. This means the correct answer must come from either Alan or Peter, and Roger must not have answered correctly via cheating.\n\n### Step 1: Define the probabilities\n- Alan's probability of answering correctly: \\( P(A) = \\frac{1}{5} \\)\n- Roger's probability of answering correctly (via cheating): \\( P(R) = \\frac{2}{3} \\)\n- Peter's probability of answering correctly: \\( P(P) = \\frac{5}{6} \\)\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter\nThe probability that either Alan or Peter answers correctly is given by:\n\\[\nP(A \\cup P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A)P(P)\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\nP(A \\cup P) = \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{5}{6} - \\left(\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{5}{6}\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\nP(A \\cup P) = \\frac{6}{30} + \\frac{25}{30} - \\frac{5}{30}\n\\]\n\\[\nP(A \\cup P) = \\frac{26}{30} = \\frac{13}{15}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the probability that Roger does not answer correctly\nThe probability that Roger does not answer correctly is:\n\\[\nP(\\neg R) = 1 - P(R) = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, and Roger does not answer correctly\nSince the events \\( A \\cup P \\) and \\( \\neg R \\) are independent, the joint probability is:\n\\[\nP((A \\cup P) \\cap \\neg R) = P(A \\cup P) \\cdot P(\\neg R)\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\nP((A \\cup P) \\cap \\neg R) = \\frac{13}{15} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{13}{45}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is \\( \\frac{13}{45} \\).\n\n**Answer: E**",
