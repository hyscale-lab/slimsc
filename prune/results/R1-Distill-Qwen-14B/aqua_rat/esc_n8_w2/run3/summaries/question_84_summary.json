      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a square piece of cloth. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says the cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge, making it rectangular. Then it's cut diagonally into two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. I need to find the perimeter of the original square.\n\nWait, let me break it down. The original shape is a square, so all sides are equal. Let's call the side length of the square 's'. When they trim 4 feet off one edge, that makes one side shorter. So the new dimensions become (s - 4) and s, because only one edge is trimmed. So the rectangle after trimming has length s and width (s -4), or maybe the other way around? Hmm, probably doesn't matter since length and width are interchangeable here.\n\nThen, this rectangle is cut diagonally into two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70. Since the area of the entire rectangle is twice that, the rectangle's area must be 140 square feet. Right, because each triangle is half of the rectangle. So the area of the rectangle is (s) * (s -4) = 140.\n\nSo I can write the equation: s(s -4) = 140. Let me expand that: s\u00b2 -4s -140 = 0. Hmm, I need to solve this quadratic equation. Let's see, using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is s\u00b2 -4s -140 = 0. So a=1, b=-4, c=-140.\n\nThe quadratic formula is s = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a). Plugging in the values: s = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 560)] / 2. Because b\u00b2 is 16, 4ac is 4*1*140=560, so 16 +560 is 576. The square root of 576 is 24. So s = [4 \u00b124]/2.\n\nSo two possible solutions: (4+24)/2=28/2=14, and (4-24)/2=-20/2=-10. But since length can't be negative, s=14 feet.\n\nSo the original square had sides of 14 feet. The perimeter of a square is 4 times the side length. So 4*14=56 feet. Looking at the options, option A is 56.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps. I think I missed something. Wait, no, the trimming was 4 feet on one edge. So the rectangle after trimming has sides of s and (s-4). So the area is s*(s-4)=140. Yeah, that's correct. Solving gives s=14. Perimeter is 4*14=56. So the answer should be option A)56.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a square piece of cloth being trimmed and then cut into triangles. Hmm, let's see. The goal is to find the perimeter of the original square cloth.\n\nAlright, let's break down the problem step by step. First, the cloth is a square. So all four sides are equal in length. Let's call the length of each side of the square 's' feet. So the perimeter of the original square would be 4 times s, which is 4s. That's what we need to find in the end.\n\nNow, the square is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge. Wait, trimming by 4 feet on one edge\u2014does that mean they're cutting off 4 feet from one side, making it shorter? So if the original side was s, after trimming, that particular side becomes s-4 feet. But wait, the problem says it's trimmed on one edge, so the other edges remain the same. So the new shape after trimming is a rectangle, right? Because one side is shorter, and the other three sides are the same as the original square.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you trim a square on one edge, you're probably removing a strip from one side. So the square becomes a rectangle with one side as s-4 and the other as s, right? Because the square had all sides s, and trimming 4 feet off one side would make that side s-4, while the other side remains s. So the rectangle's dimensions are s and s-4.\n\nThen, this rectangle is cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. So each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. The area of each triangle is half the area of the rectangle. Because when you cut a shape diagonally, you split it into two equal parts. So each triangle's area is half of the rectangle's area.\n\nSo let's compute the area of the rectangle. The rectangle has sides of s and s-4. So area is s*(s-4). Then each triangle has area (s*(s-4))/2, which is 70.\n\nSo we can set up the equation: (s*(s-4))/2 = 70.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n(s*(s -4)) / 2 = 70.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2:\n\ns*(s -4) = 140.\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\ns\u00b2 -4s =140.\n\nBringing all terms to one side:\n\ns\u00b2 -4s -140 =0.\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation: s\u00b2 -4s -140 =0.\n\nWe can solve this using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is s = [ -b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac) ] / (2a). Here, a=1, b=-4, c=-140.\n\nCalculating the discriminant:\n\nb\u00b2 -4ac = (-4)\u00b2 -4*(1)*(-140) = 16 +560 = 576.\n\nSquare root of 576 is 24.\n\nSo,\n\ns = [4 \u00b124 ] / 2.\n\nWe have two solutions:\n\ns = (4 +24)/2 =28/2=14,\n\ns = (4-24)/2= (-20)/2= -10.\n\nSince the length can't be negative, s=14 feet.\n\nWait, so the original square had sides of 14 feet. So the perimeter is 4*14=56 feet. But looking at the options, option A is 56. So is that the answer? Hmm, but let me double-check.\n\nWait, let's make sure I didn't make a mistake in the setup. Because when I trim 4 feet from one edge, the rectangle is s by s-4. Then cutting diagonally, each triangle's area is 70. So area of rectangle is 140, which equals s*(s-4). So 14*10=140. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the original square is 14x14, perimeter 56. So the answer should be A)56.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"trimmed by 4 feet on one edge.\" Does that mean 4 feet from each edge? Oh, wait, no. The wording says \"on one edge.\" So only one edge is trimmed, the others remain the same. So my initial approach was correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted the trimming. Maybe it's 4 feet from each edge, making the rectangle s-8 by s. But that would make the rectangle have sides s and s-8, and area s*(s-8). Then each triangle would be 70, so (s*(s-8))/2=70. Then s(s-8)=140. So s\u00b2-8s-140=0. Let's see the discriminant: 64 +560=624. Square root of 624 is about 24.98, so s=(8 +24.98)/2\u224816.49, which is not an integer and not in the options. So this must not be the case.\n\nSo the initial setup where only one edge is trimmed (s-4) is correct. So the original square has side 14, perimeter 56. So the answer is A.\n",
