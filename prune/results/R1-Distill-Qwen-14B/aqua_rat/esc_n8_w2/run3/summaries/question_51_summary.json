      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a money pouch with Rs. 700, and there are equal numbers of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins, and one rupee coins. I need to find out how many of each coin there are. Hmm, let's think this through step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that 1 rupee is equal to 100 paise. So, all the coins can be converted into paise to make the math easier. That way, I don't have to deal with decimals or different units.\n\nLet me denote the number of each coin as 'n'. Since they're equal in quantity, each type has 'n' coins. So, 25 paise coins, 50 paise, and 100 paise (since 1 rupee is 100 paise) all have 'n' coins each.\n\nNow, the total amount in paise would be the sum of all these coins. Let's break it down:\n\n- Each 25 paise coin contributes 25 paise. So, n coins would be 25n paise.\n- Each 50 paise coin is 50 paise each, so n coins make 50n paise.\n- Each one rupee coin is 100 paise, so n coins give 100n paise.\n\nAdding them all up, the total paise is 25n + 50n + 100n. Let me calculate that: 25 +50 is 75, plus 100 is 175. So, 175n paise in total.\n\nBut wait, the problem states the total is Rs. 700. Since 1 rupee is 100 paise, Rs. 700 is 700 * 100 = 70,000 paise.\n\nSo the equation becomes 175n = 70,000 paise. To find 'n', I'll divide both sides by 175.\n\nLet me compute that: 70,000 \u00f7 175. Hmm, I can simplify this. 175 is 25*7, and 70,000 divided by 25 is 2,800. Then divide that by 7: 2,800 \u00f77 is 400. Oh, so n is 400.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option C is 400. So that must be the answer. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nEach coin count is 400. So 25 *400 = 10,000 paise, 50 *400=20,000 paise, 100*400=40,000 paise. Adding them together: 10k +20k is 30k, plus 40k is 70k paise, which is 700 rupees. Yep, that checks out. So the number of each coin is 400. The correct option is C.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, let the number of each type of coin be \\( n \\). The total amount in paise is given by:\n\n\\[\n25n + 50n + 100n = 175n\n\\]\n\nThe total amount is Rs. 700, which is equivalent to \\( 700 \\times 100 = 70,000 \\) paise.

There are equal numbers of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins, and one rupee coins. How many of each are there? The options are A to E.\n\nHmm, right. So, all three types of coins have the same number. Let's denote that number as 'x'. So, x is the count for each type.\n\nWait, but each type has different denominations. So, 25 paise, 50 paise, and 1 rupee. I need to calculate the total amount in terms of x and set it equal to 700 rupees.\n\nWait, the total is 700 rupees, right? So, let's think about each coin's value in rupees.\n\n25 paise is 0.25 rupees. 50 paise is 0.50 rupees. And one rupee is 1.00 rupees.\n\nSince there are x of each, the total for each type would be:\n\n25 paise coins: x * 0.25\n50 paise coins: x * 0.50\n1 rupee coins: x * 1.00\n\nAdding them all together should give 700 rupees.\n\nSo the equation would be:\n\n0.25x + 0.50x + 1.00x = 700\n\nLet me add those up. 0.25 + 0.50 is 0.75, plus 1.00 is 1.75. So:\n\n1.75x = 700\n\nTo find x, I divide both sides by 1.75.\n\nx = 700 / 1.75\n\nHmm, let me calculate that. 700 divided by 1.75. Let's see, 1.75 times 400 is 700, because 1.75 * 400 = 700. Wait, no, because 1.75 * 400 is 700. Because 1.75 * 400: 1*400 is 400, 0.75*400 is 300, so 700. So x is 400.\n\nWait, but wait, the options are A)453, B)651, C)400, D)487, E)286. So option C is 400. So that's the answer, right?\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Because 1.75 times 400 is indeed 700. So x is 400.\n\nSo each type has 400 coins. That would mean 400 of 25 paise, 400 of 50 paise, and 400 of 1 rupee.\n\nLet me check the total amount again. 25 paise: 400 * 0.25 = 100. 50 paise: 400 * 0.5 = 200. 1 rupee: 400 * 1 = 400. Adding them up: 100 + 200 is 300, plus 400 is 700. Yep, that matches.\n\nSo the correct answer is C)400.\n",
