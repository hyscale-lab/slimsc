      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Karan marking up the price of a sewing machine. Hmm, let me read it again. The cost is Rs. 1200, and he wants to offer a 20% discount but still make a 20% profit. I need to find the marked price.\n\nWait, so the question is about profit and discounts. Profit is usually calculated on the cost price, right? So if he wants a 20% profit, that's 20% of 1200. Let me calculate that. 20% of 1200 is 240, so the selling price after discount should be 1200 + 240 = 1440. So he needs to sell it for 1440 after the discount.\n\nBut wait, the discount is 20% off the marked price. So the selling price is 80% of the marked price. Because 100% minus 20% discount is 80% of the marked price. So, if I let M be the marked price, then 80% of M equals 1440. So, 0.8*M = 1440. \n\nTo find M, I can rearrange that. M = 1440 / 0.8. Let me compute that. 1440 divided by 0.8. Hmm, 0.8 is 4/5, so dividing by 4/5 is the same as multiplying by 5/4. So 1440 * 5 = 7200, divided by 4 is 1800. Oh wait, wait. 1440 / 0.8 is 1800? Let me double-check: 0.8 * 1800 = 1440, yes. That makes sense.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 1800. So is that the correct answer? But wait, let me think again. Sometimes profit can be calculated on selling price, but I think in this context, it's on cost. Because usually, profit is based on cost unless specified otherwise.\n\nLet me go through it again. His cost is 1200. He wants a 20% profit on that, so 1200 * 1.2 = 1440. That's the amount he wants after the discount. So the marked price, after 20% discount, gives 1440. So yes, M * 0.8 = 1440. So M is 1800.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 1800. So the answer should be E. But wait, the options have other numbers. Let me check if I did the calculation correctly.\n\nWait, 0.8 times M equals 1440. So M = 1440 / 0.8. Let's compute that. 1440 divided by 0.8. 0.8 goes into 1440 how many times? 0.8 * 1000 is 800, 0.8 * 1800 is 1440. Oh right, so M is 1800. So E is the correct option.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the marked price at which Karan should sell the sewing machine, we start by noting that the cost price is Rs. 1200, and he wants a 20% profit.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Karan marking up the price of a sewing machine. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. \n\nThe question is asking at what price Karan should mark the machine so that even after giving a 20% discount, he still makes a 20% profit. The cost price is Rs. 1200. \n\nWait, right. So the idea is that when he sells it after the discount, his selling price should give him a 20% profit on his cost. Let me break this down. \n\nFirst, I know that profit is calculated on the cost price. So 20% profit on Rs. 1200 would be 0.20 * 1200 = Rs. 240. So the selling price after discount needs to be 1200 + 240 = Rs. 1440. \n\nBut wait, that's the price after the discount. Because he's offering a 20% discount, the selling price is 80% of the marked price. Oh right, because 100% minus 20% discount is 80% of the marked price. \n\nSo, let me denote the marked price as M. Then, after a 20% discount, the selling price is M * (1 - 0.20) = 0.80 * M. \n\nWe know that this selling price should be equal to Rs. 1440. So, 0.80 * M = 1440. To find M, we can rearrange that: M = 1440 / 0.80. \n\nCalculating that, 1440 divided by 0.8. Let's see, 1440 divided by 8 is 180, so 1440 /0.8 would be 1800. So M is Rs. 1800. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. If M is 1800, then 20% discount is 360, so selling price is 1800 - 360 = 1440. That's correct because 1440 is 1200 plus 240, which is the 20% profit. \n\nLooking at the options, E is 1800. So the correct answer should be E. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me compute 1440 divided by 0.8 again. 0.8 is 4/5. So 1440 * (5/4) = (1440 /4)*5. 1440 divided by 4 is 360. 360 *5 is 1800. Yep, that's correct. \n\nSo yeah, the marked price should be 1800. So the answer is E.\n",
