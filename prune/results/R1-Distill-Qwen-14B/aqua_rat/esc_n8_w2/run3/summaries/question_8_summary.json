      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a train's journey, and I need to figure out the total time it takes. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.\n\nThe train is running at 100 miles per hour and takes 10 hours to reach its destination normally. So normally, the total distance must be speed multiplied by time, right? So that's 100 mph * 10 hours = 1000 miles. Got it, the total distance is 1000 miles.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that after covering a quarter of the distance, it starts raining, and the train slows down to 75 mph. So I need to calculate the time taken for the first quarter and then the remaining three quarters at the slower speed.\n\nLet's break it down. A quarter of the distance is 1000 / 4 = 250 miles. The train covers this first part at 100 mph. So the time taken for the first part is distance divided by speed, which is 250 / 100. That's 2.5 hours. Okay, that makes sense.\n\nNow, the remaining distance is 1000 - 250 = 750 miles. But wait, actually, since it's a quarter, the remaining is 3 quarters, so 750 miles. And the speed is now 75 mph. So the time taken for this part is 750 / 75. Let me calculate that: 750 divided by 75 is 10 hours. Oh, that's interesting.\n\nSo the total time is the sum of the two parts: 2.5 hours + 10 hours = 12.5 hours. Let me check the options. Option C is 12.5. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. First part: 250 miles at 100 mph. 250/100=2.5. Correct. Second part: 750 at 75. 750/75=10. Yeah, 10. So 2.5 +10=12.5. Yeah, that's right. So the total time is 12.5 hours. So the correct option is C.\n",

The train was originally taking 10 hours at 100 mph, so 1000 miles. The first quarter is 250 miles, which takes 2.5 hours. The rest is 750 miles, which takes 10 hours.
