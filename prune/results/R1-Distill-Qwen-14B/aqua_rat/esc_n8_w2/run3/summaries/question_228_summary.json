      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about balls in a box. Let me read it again carefully. The box has balls marked from 1 to n. The key point is that there are 45 different ways to select two balls without selecting the one marked 3. I need to find the value of n.\n\nHmm, I remember that when you're choosing two items from a set, the number of ways is given by combinations. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! (n-k)! ), where n is the total number of items, and k is how many we're choosing.\n\nBut wait, in this problem, we're not including the ball numbered 3. So the total number of balls available for selection is n-1, because we exclude ball 3. So the number of ways to choose two balls from the remaining (n-1) balls is C(n-1, 2), and that's equal to 45.\n\nSo I can set up the equation C(n-1, 2) = 45. Let me write that out: (n-1)(n-2)/2 = 45. Because the formula for combinations when choosing 2 is (n-1)(n-2)/2.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm doing this right. Oh yeah, because C(m,2) is m(m-1)/2, where m is n-1 in this case. So substituting, m is n-1, so C(m,2) = (m)(m-1)/2 = (n-1)(n-2)/2.\n\nSo the equation is (n-1)(n-2) = 90, since I multiply both sides by 2. Let's compute that: (n-1)(n-2) = 90.\n\nI need to solve this quadratic equation. Let me expand it: n\u00b2 -3n +2 = 90. Wait, no, wait. Wait, (n-1)(n-2) = n\u00b2 -3n +2, right. So n\u00b2 -3n +2 =90. Then subtract 90: n\u00b2 -3n -88 =0.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check: (n-1)(n-2) = n\u00b2 -2n -n +2 = n\u00b2 -3n +2. Yes, right. So equation is n\u00b2 -3n +2 =90. Then n\u00b2 -3n -88=0.\n\nHmm, solving for n. Let's use quadratic formula. The quadratic is n\u00b2 -3n -88 =0. The formula is n = [3 \u00b1 sqrt(9 + 352)] / 2. Because the discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac, which is 9 + 352 (since 4*1*88=352). So sqrt(361) is 19. So n = [3 \u00b119]/2.\n\nSo two possible solutions: (3+19)/2=22/2=11, and (3-19)/2= -16/2= -8. Since n can't be negative, n=11.\n\nWait, but let me check. If n=11, then the number of balls excluding 3 is 10. So the number of ways to choose two is C(10,2) = 45. Yes, because 10*9/2=45. So that's correct.\n\nLooking at the options, A is 11. So the answer should be A) 11.\n",

The question says there are 45 different ways to choose two balls such that the ball numbered 3 is not selected. I need to find the value of n.\n\nHmm, let me think. So, the total number of ways to choose any two balls without any restrictions would be the combination of n balls taken 2 at a time. The formula for combinations is n choose 2, which is n(n-1)/2.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the ball with number 3 is not selected. So, I should find the number of ways to choose two balls when 3 is excluded. That means the balls available are from 1 to n, excluding 3. So that's (n-1) balls.\n\nSo the number of ways to choose two balls from these (n-1) is (n-1 choose 2).
