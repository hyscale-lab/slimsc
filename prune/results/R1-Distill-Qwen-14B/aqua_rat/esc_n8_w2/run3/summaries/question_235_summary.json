      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a sale and discounts. Let me try to understand it step by step. The question says that there was a discount of 20% on all articles. Vinit bought an article for Rs.4578 during the sale. I need to find out what the actual selling price was. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, actually, I think I might have misunderstood. Let me read it again.\n\nOh, right, the question says Vinit purchased the article for Rs.4578 in the sale. So that's the price after the discount. The actual selling price before the discount must be higher, right? Because the discount reduces the price. So the Rs.4578 is the discounted price, and we need to find the original selling price before the discount.\n\nHmm, okay, so the discount was 20%, which means Vinit paid 80% of the original price. Because 100% minus 20% discount is 80% of the original price. So if I let the original price be 'x', then 80% of x equals Rs.4578.\n\nMathematically, that's 0.8 * x = 4578. To find x, I can rearrange this equation. So x = 4578 divided by 0.8.\n\nWait, what's 4578 divided by 0.8? Let me calculate that. Let's see, 4578 divided by 0.8. Alternatively, since 0.8 is the same as 4/5, dividing by 0.8 is the same as multiplying by 5/4. So 4578 multiplied by 5/4.\n\nLet me compute that. 4578 * 5 = 22890. Then divide by 4: 22890 /4. Let's see, 22890 divided by 4. 4 goes into 22 five times (20), remainder 2. Bring down 8: 28. 4 into 28 is 7, remainder 0. Next digit 9: 4 into 9 is 2, remainder 1. Then 0: 4 into 10 is 2, remainder 2. So the division would be 5722.5? Wait, but that can't be right because the options are all integers. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, wait. Let me try a different approach. 4578 divided by 0.8. Let me compute 4578 * 10 = 45780. Then divide by 8. So 45780 /8. Let me calculate that.\n\n8 goes into 45 five times (5*8=40), remainder 5. Bring down 7: 57. 8 into 57 is 7 times (7*8=56), remainder 1. Bring down 8: 18. 8 into 18 is 2, remainder 2. Bring down 0: 20. 8 into 20 is 2, remainder 4. So, wait, 5722.5? Hmm, but that's a decimal. But the options given are all whole numbers. So maybe I did something wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the percentage. Let me think again. The discount is 20%, so the selling price is 80% of the original price. So the original price is higher than 4578. So when I compute 4578 /0.8, I get the original price.\n\nWait, let me try the calculation again. 4578 divided by 0.8. Let me do it step by step.\n\n0.8 is the same as 4/5, so dividing by 4/5 is multiplying by 5/4. So 4578 * 5 = 22890. Then 22890 divided by 4.\n\nDividing 22890 by 4:\n\n4 into 2 is 0, so next digit: 22. 4 into 22 is 5, 5*4=20, remainder 2. Bring down 8: 28. 4 into 28 is 7, 7*4=28. So that's 5722.5? Wait, no, wait. Wait 4 into 22 is 5, 5*4=20, remainder 2. Bring down 8: 28. 4 into 28 is 7, remainder 0. Bring down 9: 09. 4 into 9 is 2, 2*4=8, remainder 1. Bring down 0: 10. 4 into 10 is 2, remainder 2. So the result is 5722.5. But that's a decimal, but all the options are integers.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me check the question again. Oh wait, the question says \"actual selling price of the article\". Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the Rs.4578 is the original price, and the selling price is after the discount. But that can't be, because the question says Vinit purchased it in the sale, so the sale price would be lower.\n\nWait, the question says: \"If Vinit purchased an article for Rs.4578 in the sale.\" So the Rs.4578 is after the discount. So the original price is higher, and 4578 is 80% of that.\n\nSo my calculation is correct. So the original price is 4578 / 0.8 = 5722.5. But that's 5722.5, which isn't one of the options. Hmm, the options are A)5050, B)5723, C)5040, D)4950, E)4870.\n\nWait, option B is 5723. So 5722.5 is approximately 5723. But why the decimal? Maybe I made a mistake in the division.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute 4578 * 5 = 22890. Then 22890 divided by 4 is 5722.5. So yes, that's correct. So the original price would be 5722.5, which is approximately 5723. So the correct option is B)5723.\n\nBut wait, wait another thing. Let me think again. Maybe the way I approached it is wrong. Because sometimes, the discount is applied on the selling price, not the original price. Or perhaps the question is phrased differently. Wait, the problem states that a discount of 20% is available on all articles. So the selling price is 20% off the original price. So the selling price is 80% of the original.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the options again. Let me see: option B is 5723. So 5723 * 0.8 = 4578.4. Hmm, which is very close to 4578. So that makes sense. Because 5723 * 0.8 is 4578.4, which rounds to 4578 when considering whole rupees. So that's why option B is correct.\n\nWait, but why is the original price 5723 when 5723 * 0.8 is 4578.4, which is a bit more than 4578. Maybe the actual calculation would give exactly 4578. Let me see: 5723 * 0.8 = ?\n\nCalculating 5723 * 0.8: 5000 *0.8=4000, 700*0.8=560, 20*0.8=16, 3*0.8=2.4. So adding them: 4000 +560 =4560; +16=4576; +2.4=4578.4. So yes, that's correct. So 5723 * 0.8 is 4578.4, which is 4578 when rounded down, perhaps. But in the problem, the amount paid is exactly Rs.4578. So that suggests that the original price was 5722.5, but that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if any of the other options, when multiplied by 0.8, give exactly 4578.\n\nLet me check option C: 5040. 5040 *0.8=4032. That's way below 4578. So no.\n\nOption A: 5050 *0.8=4040. Also no.\n\nOption D:4950 *0.8=3960. No.\n\nOption E:4870 *0.8=3896. No.\n\nSo only option B gives a value close to 4578.4, which is 4578 when rounded down.\n\nBut wait, the problem says Vinit purchased it for 4578 exactly. So perhaps the original price is 5722.5, but since the options don't have that, the correct option is B)5723.\n\nSo the answer should be option B.\n",

Let me read it again carefully. \n\nThe problem says that there's a sale where a discount of 20% is available on all articles. Vinit bought an article for Rs.4578 during the sale. The question is asking for the actual selling price of the article. Hmm, wait, that's a bit confusing. Wait, no, the selling price during the sale is what Vinit paid, which is Rs.4578. So the actual selling price before the discount would be higher, right?\n\nWait, no. Wait, maybe I got that mixed up. Let me think. So the discount is 20%, which means the customer pays 80% of the original price. Because if you take 20% off, you're left with 80%. So the Rs.4578 is the price after the 20% discount. So the actual selling price before discount would be higher than 4578. \n\nWait, but the options are all different. Let me make sure I'm getting this right. The question is, what was the actual selling price? So the original price, or the marked price, before the discount. Because the discounted price is what Vinit paid.\n\nSo the formula for discount is: Selling Price = Marked Price \u00d7 (1 - Discount%). \n\nSo, Marked Price = Selling Price / (1 - Discount%). \n\nIn this case, the discount is 20%, so the Selling Price is 80% of Marked Price. \n\nSo Marked Price = 4578 / 0.80. Let me calculate that. \n\n4578 divided by 0.8. Let me do the division. \n\nWell, 4578 divided by 0.8. Hmm, 0.8 is the same as 4/5. So dividing by 4/5 is the same as multiplying by 5/4. So 4578 * 5/4. \n\nLet me compute that. 4578 multiplied by 5 is 22890. Then divide by 4. 22890 /4 is... 5722.5. Wait, but the options are all in whole numbers. Let me check my calculation again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me try another approach. 4578 divided by 0.8. Let's see, 4578 divided by 0.8.\n\nAlternatively, 0.8 times what equals 4578. Let me think, 4578 divided by 0.8. \n\n0.8 is 8/10, so 4578 * (10/8) = 4578 * (5/4) = (4578 *5)/4.\n\nCalculating 4578 *5: 4000*5 is 20,000, 500*5 is 2500, 78*5 is 390. So 20,000 + 2,500 is 22,500, plus 390 is 22,890. Now divide 22,890 by 4.\n\n22,890 divided by 4: 4 into 22 is 5, remainder 2. 4 into 28 is 7, remainder 0. 4 into 9 is 2, remainder 1. 4 into 10 is 2, remainder 2. So wait, maybe I should write this out.\n\nWait, 4 x 5722 is 22,888. Because 5700 *4 is 22,800. 22 *4 is 88, so 22,888. But 22,890 is 2 more than 22,888. So 5722.5 is 22,890/4.\n\nBut the options don't have a .5. Let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA) 5050\nB)5723\nC)5040\nD)4950\nE)4870\n\nWait, 5722.5 is approximately 5722.5, which is close to option B)5723. But wait, maybe I should check if I did the math correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again. The problem says the article was purchased for Rs.4578 with a 20% discount. So the selling price after discount is 4578. So the original price before discount is higher.\n\nSo, original price = 4578 / 0.8 = 5722.5. So the closest option is B)5723. But wait, wait, looking at the options, option B is 5723. So that's likely the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that 20% of 5722.5 is 1144.5. Because 5722.5 * 0.2 = 1144.5. Subtract that from 5722.5, you get 4578. So that matches.\n\nSo the correct answer would be option B)5723. But wait, the options are given as 's.5723', so the Rs symbol is correct.\n\nWait, but wait, looking at the options, option B is 5723. So that's the correct one.\n\nWait, but why isn't it one of the other options? Let me quickly check.\n\nIf the options are A)5050, that would be way lower than 5722.5, so no. C)5040 is even lower. D)4950 is lower. E)4870 is lower. So the only option near 5722.5 is option B, which is 5723.\n\nSo I think the correct answer is B)5723.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the actual selling price of the article before the discount, we use the relationship between the selling price after the discount and the original price.

So the discount is 20%, which means the customer pays 80% of the original price. Because if you take 20% off, you're left with 80%. So the Rs.4578 is the price after the 20% discount. So the actual selling price before discount would be higher than 4578. \n\nWait, but the options are all different. Let me make sure I'm getting this right. The question is, what was the actual selling price? So the original price, or the marked price, before the discount. Because the discounted price is what Vinit paid.\n\nSo the formula for discount is: Selling Price = Marked Price \u00d7 (1 - Discount%). \n\nSo, Marked Price = Selling Price / (1 - Discount%). \n\nIn this case, the discount is 20%, so the Selling Price is 80% of Marked Price. \n\nSo Marked Price = 4578 / 0.80. Let me calculate that. \n\n4578 divided by 0.8. Let me do the division. \n\nWell, 4578 divided by 0.8. Hmm, 0.8 is the same as 4/5. So dividing by 4/5 is the same as multiplying by 5/4. So 4578 * 5/4. \n\nLet me compute that. 4578 multiplied by 5 is 22890. Then divide by 4. 22890 /4 is... 5722.5. Wait, but the options are all in whole numbers. Let me check my calculation again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me try another approach. 4578 divided by 0.8. Let's see, 4578 divided by 0.8.\n\nAlternatively, 0.8 times what equals 4578. Let me think, 4578 divided by 0.8. \n\n0.8 is 8/10, so 4578 * (10/8) = 4578 * (5/4) = (4578 *5)/4.\n\nCalculating 4578 *5: 4000*5 is 20,000, 500*5 is 2500, 78*5 is 390. So 20,000 + 2,500 is 22,500, plus 390 is 22,890. Now divide 22,890 by 4.\n\n22,890 divided by 4: 4 into 22 is 5, remainder 2. 4 into 28 is 7, remainder 0. 4 into 9 is 2, remainder 1. 4 into 10 is 2, remainder 2. So wait, maybe I should write this out.\n\nWait, 4 x 5722 is 22,888. Because 5700 *4 is 22,800. 22 *4 is 88, so 22,888. But 22,890 is 2 more than 22,888. So 5722.5 is 22,890/4.\n\nBut the options don't have a .5. Let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA) 5050\nB)5723\nC)5040\nD)4950\nE)4870\n\nWait, 5722.5 is approximately 5722.5, which is close to option B)5723. But wait, maybe I should check if I did the math correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again. The problem says the article was purchased for Rs.4578 with a 20% discount. So the selling price after discount is 4578. So the original price before discount is higher.\n\nSo, original price = 4578 / 0.8 = 5722.5. So the closest option is B)5723. But wait, wait, looking at the options, option B is 5723. So that's likely the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that 20% of 5722.5 is 1144.5. Because 5722.5 * 0.2 = 1144.5. Subtract that from 5722.5, you get 4578. So that matches.\n\nSo the correct answer would be option B)5723. But wait, the options are given as 's.5723', so the Rs symbol is correct.\n\nWait, but wait, looking at the options, option B is 5723. So that's the correct one.\n\nWait, but why isn't it one of the other options? Let me quickly check.\n\nIf the options are A)5050, that would be way lower than 5722.5, so no. C)5040 is even lower. D)4950 is lower. E)4870 is lower. So the only option near 5722.5 is option B, which is 5723.\n\nSo I think the correct answer is B)5723.\n\n\nTo determine the actual selling price of the article before the discount, we use the relationship between the selling price after the discount and the original price. A 20% discount means the customer pays 80% of the original price. Therefore, the original price can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Original Price} = \\frac{\\text{Selling Price After Discount}}{0.80}\n\\]\n\nGiven that the selling price after the discount is Rs. 4578, we substitute this value:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Original Price} = \\frac{4578}{0.80} = 4578 \\times \\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{22890}{4} = 5722.5\n\\]\n\nSince the options are given in whole numbers, the closest value to 5722.5 is 5723. Among the provided options:\n\n- **A) 5050**: Too low.\n- **B) 5723**: Matches the calculated value.\n- **C) 5040**: Too low.\n- **D) 4950**: Too low.\n- **E) 4870**: Too low.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **B) 5723**.\n\nAnswer: B",
