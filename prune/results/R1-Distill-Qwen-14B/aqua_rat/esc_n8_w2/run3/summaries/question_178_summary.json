      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I've got this problem here about Sachin and Ajay's ages. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on age problems, but I'll try to work through it step by step.\n\nSo the question says: Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back. How old is Ajay today if Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years.\n\nWait, let me parse that. So, there are two time points here: 10 years ago and 10 years from now.\n\nFirst, let's break down the information. \n\nLet me assign variables. Let's say today, Sachin's age is S, and Ajay's age is A.\n\nFrom the first part: Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years ago. So, 10 years ago, Sachin's age was S-10, and Ajay's age was A-10. According to the problem, S-10 equals 2 times (A-10). So equation one is S - 10 = 2*(A - 10).\n\nThen, the second part says that Sachin will be 40 in 10 years. So in 10 years, Sachin's age will be S + 10. And that equals 40. So equation two is S + 10 = 40.\n\nWait, that's straightforward. Let me solve equation two first. S + 10 =40 \u2192 S = 40 -10 \u2192 S=30. So today, Sachin is 30 years old.\n\nNow, plug that into equation one. S is 30, so 30 -10 = 2*(A-10). That becomes 20 = 2*(A-10). Divide both sides by 2: 10 = A -10. So A = 20. \n\nWait, so Ajay is 20 years old today. Looking at the options, D is 20. So the answer should be D.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nSachin is 30 today. 10 years ago, he was 20. Ajay is 20 today, so 10 years ago he was 10. 20 is twice 10, which fits the first condition. Also, in 10 years, Sachin will be 40, which matches the second condition. So yes, everything checks out.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nLet the current age of Sachin be \\( S \\) and the current age of Ajay be \\( A \\).\n\n1. From the first condition: Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years ago.

Let me read it again.\n\nSo, the problem says: Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back. How old is Ajay today if Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years. The options are A to E.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to find Ajay's current age. Let's assign variables to make it easier. Let me denote Sachin's current age as S and Ajay's current age as A.\n\nThe first part says that 10 years ago, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay.
