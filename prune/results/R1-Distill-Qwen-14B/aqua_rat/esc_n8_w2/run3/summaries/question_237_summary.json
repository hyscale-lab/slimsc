      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about selecting candy bars. Let me read it again carefully. \n\nThe bag has 11 candy bars. There are three types: three cost 50 cents each, four cost a dollar each, and four cost two dollars each. I need to find how many ways I can pick 3 candy bars such that the total cost is more than $4. The options are A to E, with numbers ranging from 8 to 70.\n\nHmm. So, the first thing I should probably do is figure out all the possible combinations of three candy bars and then calculate their costs. But wait, that might take too long because there are multiple types. Maybe I can approach this by considering the different possible groupings of the candy bars and see which combinations result in a total cost exceeding $4.\n\nLet me break down the types:\n\n- Type A: 3 bars at $0.50 each. So, 3 bars, cost per bar is 0.5.\n- Type B: 4 bars at $1 each. 4 bars, cost 1 each.\n- Type C: 4 bars at $2 each. 4 bars, cost 2 each.\n\nI need to choose 3 bars. The possible combinations of types could be:\n\n1. All three are Type C.\n2. Two Type C and one other.\n3. One Type C and two others.\n4. All three are Type B.\n5. Two Type B and one Type C.\n6. One Type B and two Type C.\n7. Also, perhaps combinations with Type A, but since Type A is cheaper, maybe they don't contribute much to the total cost.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to calculate the total cost for each possible combination and see which ones sum to more than $4.\n\nLet me list all possible combinations of three candy bars:\n\nThe possible types for the three bars can be:\n\n- 3C (three Type C)\n- 2C and 1B\n- 2C and 1A\n- 1C and 2B\n- 1C and 1B and 1A\n- 1C and 2A\n- 3B\n- 2B and 1A\n- 1B and 2A\n- 3A\n\nBut wait, that's a lot. Maybe it's easier to think in terms of how many of each type are selected.\n\nWait, another approach: the total number of ways to choose 3 bars is C(11,3) which is 165. But the question asks for the number of ways where the total is more than $4. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the total number of ways without the cost constraint, which is 165, and then subtract the number of ways where the total cost is $4 or less.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of 3-bar combinations where the cost is <=4 dollars, and subtract that from the total number of possible combinations (165) to get the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check: 3 bars can't cost more than 6 dollars (if all three are $2 each, 3*2=6). But the question is about more than 4 dollars, so the threshold is 4.01 to 6.\n\nHmm, but perhaps it's easier to compute the number of ways where the total cost is <=4, and then subtract from 165 to get the desired count.\n\nLet me compute the number of 3-bar combinations where the total cost is <=4.\n\nSo, I need to consider all possible combinations of the three types (A, B, C) such that their total cost is <=4.\n\nLet me denote the number of each type selected as (x, y, z), where x is the number of Type A (0-3), y is Type B (0-4), z is Type C (0-4). And x + y + z =3. The cost is 0.5x + 1y + 2z <=4.\n\nWe can model this with x, y, z >=0, integers, x<=3, y<=4, z<=4, x+y+z=3.\n\nNow, let's find all possible (x, y, z) that satisfy the cost condition.\n\nLet me list all possible (x, y, z) combinations where x+y+z=3, and compute 0.5x + y + 2z.\n\nWe can approach this systematically.\n\nCase 1: z=3 (all three are Type C)\nThen x=0, y=0. Cost: 0 +0 + 6=6>4. So this is over, so this case doesn't contribute to the <=4 condition.\n\nCase 2: z=2. Then x + y =1.\n\nSubcases:\na) x=0, y=1. Cost: 0 +1 +4=5>4. No.\nb) x=1, y=0. Cost:0.5 +0 +4=4.5>4. No.\n\nSo no valid combinations in z=2.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, 4 dollars is the limit. So, if the cost is exactly 4, is that included in the \"more than 4\" or the \"less than or equal to 4\"?\n\nThe question says \"total cost is more than $4\", so the condition for exclusion is when the cost is <=4. So any combination with cost <=4 is to be subtracted.\n\nSo, in case 2, when z=2, y=1, cost is 5>4, so it doesn't count. Similarly, z=2, x=1, cost is 4.5>4. So, no.\n\nCase 3: z=1. Then x + y =2.\n\nSubcases:\na) y=2, x=0. Cost:0 +2 +2=4. So this is exactly 4, which is <=4. So valid.\nb) y=1, x=1. Cost:0.5 +1 +2=3.5 <=4. Valid.\nc) y=0, x=2. Cost:1.0 +0 +2=3 <=4. Valid.\n\nSo in this case, for z=1, we have three subcases where the cost is <=4.\n\nCase 4: z=0. Then x + y =3.\n\nSubcases:\na) y=3, x=0. Cost:0 +3 +0=3 <=4. Valid.\nb) y=2, x=1. Cost:0.5 +2 +0=2.5 <=4. Valid.\nc) y=1, x=2. Cost:1.0 +1 +0=2 <=4. Valid.\nd) y=0, x=3. Cost:1.5 +0 +0=1.5 <=4. Valid.\n\nSo, for z=0, all four subcases are valid.\n\nWait, let me double-check each of these:\n\nz=0, y=3, x=0: cost=3*1=3. Yes.\n\nz=0, y=2, x=1: 2*1 +1*0.5=2.5.\n\nz=0, y=1, x=2: 1*1 + 2*0.5 = 1 +1 =2.\n\nz=0, y=0, x=3: 3*0.5=1.5.\n\nAll correct.\n\nSo now, let's count all the valid (x,y,z) cases where cost <=4.\n\nFrom case 3 (z=1):\n\na) y=2, x=0. So, how many ways are there to choose 2 Type B and 1 Type C.\n\nBut wait, the counts are limited by the number of each type available.\n\nWait, the problem is that the counts x, y, z can't exceed the available number of each type.\n\nAh, right! Because there are only 3 Type A, 4 Type B, and 4 Type C.\n\nSo, for each case, I have to compute the number of ways considering the available quantities.\n\nSo, let's re-examine each subcase, not just the cost, but also the number of available bars.\n\nSo, for each (x,y,z) combination, the number of ways is (number of ways to choose x from A) * (number of ways to choose y from B) * (number of ways to choose z from C).\n\nBecause the types are distinct, the selection is independent for each type.\n\nSo, for each (x,y,z), the number of ways is C(3,x) * C(4,y) * C(4,z), provided x<=3, y<=4, z<=4.\n\nNow, let's compute the number of valid (x,y,z) combinations and their corresponding counts.\n\nLet me start with all cases where cost <=4:\n\nCase 3: z=1.\n\nSubcases:\n\na) z=1, y=2, x=0.\n\nNumber of ways: C(3,0)*C(4,2)*C(4,1) =1 *6 *4=24.\n\nb) z=1, y=1, x=1.\n\nNumber of ways: C(3,1)*C(4,1)*C(4,1)=3 *4 *4=48.\n\nc) z=1, y=0, x=2.\n\nNumber of ways: C(3,2)*C(4,0)*C(4,1)=3 *1 *4=12.\n\nSo, total for z=1: 24 +48 +12=84.\n\nCase 4: z=0.\n\nSubcases:\n\na) z=0, y=3, x=0.\n\nNumber of ways: C(3,0)*C(4,3)*C(4,0)=1 *4 *1=4.\n\nb) z=0, y=2, x=1.\n\nNumber of ways: C(3,1)*C(4,2)*C(4,0)=3 *6 *1=18.\n\nc) z=0, y=1, x=2.\n\nNumber of ways: C(3,2)*C(4,1)*C(4,0)=3 *4 *1=12.\n\nd) z=0, y=0, x=3.\n\nNumber of ways: C(3,3)*C(4,0)*C(4,0)=1 *1 *1=1.\n\nAdding these up: 4 +18 +12 +1=35.\n\nSo, total number of 3-bar combinations where the cost is <=4 is 84 (z=1) +35 (z=0) =119.\n\nWait, wait, but I also need to consider cases where z=0 and other combinations. Hmm, but I think I got all possible (x,y,z) combinations where x+y+z=3 and cost <=4.\n\nSo, the total number of such combinations is 84 +35=119.\n\nBut wait, what about other z values? For example, z=3, but that was cost 6>4, so no. z=2, as discussed, all combinations have cost >4, so no.\n\nSo, the total number of 3-bar selections where the cost is <=4 is 119.\n\nTherefore, the number of 3-bar selections where the cost is >4 is total selections (165) minus 119.\n\n165-119=46.\n\nSo, the answer is 46, which is option C.\n",

Hmm, but I think I got all possible (x,y,z) combinations where x+y+z=3 and cost <=4.\n\nSo, the total number of such combinations is 84 +35=119.\n\nBut wait, what about other z values?

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about selecting candy bars and their total cost. Let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nSo, the bag has 11 candy bars. They're divided into three groups: three cost 50 cents each, four cost $1 each, and four cost $2 each. The question is asking how many ways we can select 3 candy bars such that the total cost is more than $4. The options are A to E, with the numbers given.\n\nHmm, first, I think I should understand the total number of possible ways to choose any 3 candy bars without any restrictions. Since there are 11, the combination would be 11 choose 3. Let me calculate that: 11*10*9/(3*2*1) = 165. So, 165 possible ways in total.\n\nBut we need the total cost to be more than $4. So, the approach here is probably to find all possible selections of 3 candy bars and subtract those whose total cost is $4 or less. Alternatively, we could calculate directly the number of combinations where the sum is greater than $4, but that might be complicated because there are various price combinations. Maybe it's easier to find the number of combinations that sum to $4 or less and subtract that from the total.\n\nSo, total ways = 165. Let me find the number of ways where the total is \u2264$4. Then, subtracting that from 165 will give the answer.\n\nWhat are the possible combinations of three candy bars that sum to $4 or less?\n\nLet me list all possible combinations of the candy bars and their costs. The candy bars can be from the 50c group, the $1 group, or the $2 group.\n\nEach selection is a combination of three, so let's see:\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n1. All three are 50c: 3 * 0.50 = $1.50\n2. Two 50c and one $1: 2*0.5 +1= $2.00\n3. Two 50c and one $2: 2*0.5 +2= $3.00\n4. One 50c, two $1s: 0.5 + 2*1= $2.50\n5. One 50c, one $1, one $2: 0.5 +1 +2= $3.50\n6. Three $1s: 3*1= $3.00\n7. Two $1s and one $2: 2*1 +2= $4.00\n8. One $1 and two $2s: 1 + 4= $5.00 (Wait, but that's more than $4, so it's not counted)\nWait, but the problem is looking for total >$4, so the ones that are \u2264$4 are the ones we need to exclude. So, let me think about all possible combinations where the sum is \u2264$4.\n\nWait, but the problem is about selecting three candy bars. So each combination is three, so let's see which of the possible groupings add up to <=4 dollars.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all possible combinations of 3 candy bars and calculate their total cost, then count how many are <=4. Then subtract from 165.\n\nWait, but that's a lot of combinations. Maybe it's better to think about the possible price combinations and see which ones are <=4.\n\nSo, the possible individual candy bar prices are 0.5, 1, and 2.\n\nWe need to pick three, so possible price combinations:\n\nLet me think of all possible triplets (a, b, c), where a is the number of 50c bars, b the number of $1 bars, and c the number of $2 bars, with a + b + c =3.\n\nEach a can be 0,1,2,3; same for b and c, but they can't exceed the available quantities. So, a can be up to 3, b up to 4, c up to 4.\n\nBut for each (a,b,c), the sum would be 0.5a + 1*b + 2*c.\n\nWe need 0.5a + b + 2c <=4.\n\nWait, but since the sum has to be <=4, let's compute for each possible (a,b,c) whether the sum is <=4.\n\nBut considering that a, b, c can't be more than 3, 4, 4 respectively, and a + b + c=3.\n\nSo, let's list all possible (a,b,c) where a + b + c=3, and 0.5a + b + 2c <=4.\n\nLet me go through each possible a from 0 to 3, and for each a, find possible b and c.\n\nCase 1: a=3, then b=0, c=0.\n\nSum is 3*0.5 =1.5 \u22644 \u2192 valid.\n\nCase 2: a=2. Then, b + c=1.\n\nPossible (b,c) pairs:\n\n(0,1): sum=2*0.5 +0 +1*2=1 +0 +2=3 \u22644 \u2192 valid.\n\n(1,0): sum=1 +1=2 \u22644 \u2192 valid.\n\nSo, both are valid.\n\nCase3: a=1. Then, b + c=2.\n\nPossible (b,c):\n\n(0,2): sum=0.5 +0 +4=4.5 \u2192 4.5>4 \u2192 invalid.\n\n(1,1): sum=0.5 +1 +2=3.5 \u22644 \u2192 valid.\n\n(2,0): sum=0.5 +2 +0=2.5 \u22644 \u2192 valid.\n\nSo, for a=1, the valid (b,c) are (1,1) and (2,0). The (0,2) is invalid.\n\nCase4: a=0. Then, b + c=3.\n\nPossible (b,c):\n\n(0,3): sum=0 +0 +6=6>4 \u2192 invalid.\n\n(1,2): sum=1 +2=3 \u2192 wait, 1*1 + 2*2=1+4=5 \u2192 5>4 \u2192 invalid.\n\n(2,1): sum=2 +2=4 \u2192 4 is equal to 4 \u2192 valid.\n\n(3,0): sum=3 \u2192 valid.\n\nSo, for a=0, the valid (b,c) are (2,1) and (3,0).\n\nNow, let's list all the valid (a,b,c) tuples:\n\na=3 \u2192 (3,0,0) \u2192 sum=1.5 \u2192 valid.\n\na=2 \u2192 (2,0,1) sum=3; (2,1,0) sum=2 \u2192 both valid.\n\na=1 \u2192 (1,1,1) sum=3.5; (1,2,0) sum=2.5 \u2192 both valid.\n\na=0 \u2192 (0,2,1) sum=4; (0,3,0) sum=3 \u2192 both valid.\n\nWait, wait, let me double-check each sum:\n\nFor a=2, (2,0,1): 2*0.5 =1, plus 0*1, plus 1*2=2 \u2192 total 3.\n\n(2,1,0): 1 +1 \u2192 total 2.\n\na=1:\n\n(1,1,1): 0.5 +1 +2=3.5.\n\n(1,2,0):0.5 +2 +0=2.5.\n\na=0:\n\n(0,2,1): 2 +2=4.\n\n(0,3,0):3.\n\nWait, but wait a second, (0,3,0) would be 3*$1, sum=3 \u2192 which is <=4.\n\nSo, how many valid (a,b,c) tuples do we have?\n\nFrom a=3: 1.\n\na=2: 2.\n\na=1: 2.\n\na=0: 2.\n\nTotal of 1+2+2+2=7 possible types.\n\nWait, but each of these corresponds to a certain number of combinations, considering the available quantities.\n\nBecause the number of ways to choose a 50c bars is C(3,a), since there are 3 available.\n\nSimilarly, for $1 bars, it's C(4,b), and for $2 bars, C(4,c).\n\nBut for each (a,b,c), we have to make sure that a<=3, b<=4, c<=4.\n\nSo, let's calculate the number of ways for each valid (a,b,c):\n\n1. a=3, b=0, c=0:\n\nWays: C(3,3) * C(4,0) * C(4,0) = 1 *1 *1 =1.\n\n2. a=2, b=0, c=1:\n\nWays: C(3,2)*C(4,0)*C(4,1) =3 *1 *4=12.\n\n3. a=2, b=1, c=0:\n\nWays: C(3,2)*C(4,1)*C(4,0) =3 *4 *1=12.\n\n4. a=1, b=1, c=1:\n\nWays: C(3,1)*C(4,1)*C(4,1)=3 *4 *4=48.\n\n5. a=1, b=2, c=0:\n\nWays: C(3,1)*C(4,2)*C(4,0)=3 *6 *1=18.\n\n6. a=0, b=2, c=1:\n\nWays: C(3,0)*C(4,2)*C(4,1)=1 *6 *4=24.\n\n7. a=0, b=3, c=0:\n\nWays: C(3,0)*C(4,3)*C(4,0)=1 *4 *1=4.\n\nWait, but wait, in case a=0, b=2, c=1: sum is 4 dollars. So that's included.\n\nNow, let's sum all these ways:\n\n1. 1\n\n2. 12 \u2192 total so far 13.\n\n3. 12 \u2192 25.\n\n4. 48 \u219273.\n\n5. 18 \u219291.\n\n6. 24 \u2192115.\n\n7. 4 \u2192119.\n\nSo, the total number of ways where the sum is \u22644 is 119.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Is that correct? Let me recount each calculation.\n\nWait, for (a=3,0,0): 3 choose 3 is 1. 4 choose 0 is 1. So 1*1*1=1. Correct.\n\na=2,0,1: 3C2=3, 4C0=1,4C1=4 \u2192 3*1*4=12. Correct.\n\na=2,1,0: 3C2=3,4C1=4,4C0=1 \u21923*4*1=12. Correct.\n\na=1,1,1: 3C1=3,4C1=4,4C1=4 \u21923*4*4=48. Correct.\n\na=1,2,0: 3C1=3,4C2=6,4C0=1 \u21923*6*1=18. Correct.\n\na=0,2,1:3C0=1,4C2=6,4C1=4 \u21921*6*4=24. Correct.\n\na=0,3,0:3C0=1,4C3=4,4C0=1 \u21921*4*1=4. Correct.\n\nAdding all: 1+12=13, +12=25, +48=73, +18=91, +24=115, +4=119. Yes.\n\nSo total ways with sum \u22644 is 119. Then, the total ways are 165, so the number of ways where sum>4 is 165-119=46.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option C is 46. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Did I miss any cases? Because sometimes when you count combinations, you might miss some possibilities.\n\nWait, let me think: any other (a,b,c) where a + b + c=3 and the sum is \u22644?\n\nWait, another way: perhaps I should check each possible combination again.\n\nWait, for a=0, is (b=1, c=2) allowed? Because a=0, b=1, c=2: sum is 1*1 +2*2=1+4=5>4, which is invalid. So not included.\n\nSimilarly, a=1, b=0, c=2: sum 0.5 +0 +4=4.5>4 \u2192 invalid. So not included.\n\nHmm, I think I covered all the cases. So the calculation seems correct.\n",

Then, b + c=3.\n\nPossible (b,c):\n\n(0,3): sum=0 +0 +6=6>4 \u2192 invalid.\n\n(1,2): sum=1 +2=3 \u2192 wait, 1*1 + 2*2=1+4=5 \u2192 5>4 \u2192 invalid.\n\n(2,1): sum=2 +2=4 \u2192 4 is equal to 4 \u2192 valid.\n\n(3,0): sum=3 \u2192 valid.\n\nSo, for a=0, the valid (b,c) are (2,1) and (3,0).\n\nNow, let's list all the valid (a,b,c) tuples:\n\na=3 \u2192 (3,0,0) \u2192 sum=1.5 \u2192 valid.\n\na=2 \u2192 (2,0,1) sum=3; (2,1,0) sum=2 \u2192 both valid.\n\na=1 \u2192 (1,1,1) sum=3.5; (1,2,0) sum=2.5 \u2192 both valid.\n\na=0 \u2192 (0,2,1) sum=4; (0,3,0) sum=3 \u2192 both valid.\n\nWait, wait, let me double-check each sum:\n\nFor a=2, (2,0,1): 2*0.5 =1, plus 0*1, plus 1*2=2 \u2192 total 3.\n\n(2,1,0): 1 +1 \u2192 total 2.\n\na=1:\n\n(1,1,1): 0.5 +1 +2=3.5.\n\n(1,2,0):0.5 +2 +0=2.5.\n\na=0:\n\n(0,2,1): 2 +2=4.\n\n(0,3,0):3.\n\nWait, but wait a second, (0,3,0) would be 3*$1, sum=3 \u2192 which is <=4.\n\nSo, how many valid (a,b,c) tuples do we have?\n\nFrom a=3: 1.\n\na=2: 2.\n\na=1: 2.\n\na=0: 2.\n\nTotal of 1+2+2+2=7 possible types.\n\nWait, but each of these corresponds to a certain number of combinations, considering the available quantities.\n\nBecause the number of ways to choose a 50c bars is C(3,a), since there are 3 available.\n\nSimilarly, for $1 bars, it's C(4,b), and for $2 bars, C(4,c).\n\nBut for each (a,b,c), we have to make sure that a<=3, b<=4, c<=4.\n\nSo, let's calculate the number of ways for each valid (a,b,c):\n\n1. a=3, b=0, c=0:\n\nWays: C(3,3) * C(4,0) * C(4,0) = 1 *1 *1 =1.\n\n2. a=2, b=0, c=1:\n\nWays: C(3,2)*C(4,0)*C(4,1) =3 *1 *4=12.\n\n3. a=2, b=1, c=0:\n\nWays: C(3,2)*C(4,1)*C(4,0) =3 *4 *1=12.\n\n4. a=1, b=1, c=1:\n\nWays: C(3,1)*C(4,1)*C(4,1)=3 *4 *4=48.\n\n5. a=1, b=2, c=0:\n\nWays: C(3,1)*C(4,2)*C(4,0)=3 *6 *1=18.\n\n6. a=0, b=2, c=1:\n\nWays: C(3,0)*C(4,2)*C(4,1)=1 *6 *4=24.\n\n7. a=0, b=3, c=0:\n\nWays: C(3,0)*C(4,3)*C(4,0)=1 *4 *1=4.\n\nWait, but wait, in case a=0, b=2, c=1: sum is 4 dollars. So that's included.\n\nNow, let's sum all these ways:\n\n1. 1\n\n2. 12 \u2192 total so far 13.\n\n3. 12 \u2192 25.\n\n4. 48 \u219273.\n\n5. 18 \u219291.\n\n6. 24 \u2192115.\n\n7. 4 \u2192119.\n\nSo, the total number of ways where the sum is \u22644 is 119.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Is that correct? Let me recount each calculation.\n\nWait, for (a=3,0,0): 3 choose 3 is 1. 4 choose 0 is 1. So 1*1*1=1. Correct.\n\na=2,0,1: 3C2=3, 4C0=1,4C1=4 \u2192 3*1*4=12. Correct.\n\na=2,1,0: 3C2=3,4C1=4,4C0=1 \u21923*4*1=12. Correct.\n\na=1,1,1: 3C1=3,4C1=4,4C1=4 \u21923*4*4=48. Correct.\n\na=1,2,0: 3C1=3,4C2=6,4C0=1 \u21923*6*1=18. Correct.\n\na=0,2,1:3C0=1,4C2=6,4C1=4 \u21921*6*4=24. Correct.\n\na=0,3,0:3C0=1,4C3=4,4C0=1 \u21921*4*1=4. Correct.\n\nAdding all: 1+12=13, +12=25, +48=73, +18=91, +24=115, +4=119. Yes.\n\nSo total ways with sum \u22644 is 119. Then, the total ways are 165, so the number of ways where sum>4 is 165-119=46.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option C is 46. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Did I miss any cases? Because sometimes when you count combinations, you might miss some possibilities.\n\nWait, let me think: any other (a,b,c) where a + b + c=3 and the sum is \u22644?\n\nWait, another way: perhaps I should check each possible combination again.\n\nWait, for a=0, is (b=1, c=2) allowed? Because a=0, b=1, c=2: sum is 1*1 +2*2=1+4=5>4, which is invalid. So not included.\n\nSimilarly, a=1, b=0, c=2: sum 0.5 +0 +4=4.5>4 \u2192 invalid. So not included.\n\nHmm, I think I covered all the cases. So the calculation seems correct.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to select 3 candy bars from 11 such that the total cost is more than $4. The candy bars are divided into three groups: 3 cost 50 cents each, 4 cost $1 each, and 4 cost $2 each.\n\n### Total Number of Ways\nThe total number of ways to select 3 candy bars from 11 is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{11}{3} = \\frac{11 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 9}{3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = 165\n\\]\n\n### Number of Ways with Total Cost \u2264 $4\nTo find the number of ways where the total cost is \u2264 $4, we consider all possible combinations of 3 candy bars and calculate their total costs. The valid combinations are:\n\n1. **(a=3, b=0, c=0):** 3 candy bars at 50 cents each.  \n   Cost: \\(3 \\cdot 0.5 = 1.5\\) (\u2264 $4).  \n   Number of ways:  \n   \\[\n   \\binom{3}{3} \\cdot \\binom{4}{0} \\cdot \\binom{4}{0} = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = 1\n   \\]\n\n2. **(a=2, b=0, c=1):** 2 candy bars at 50 cents and 1 candy bar at $2.  \n   Cost: \\(2 \\cdot 0.5 + 1 \\cdot 2 = 3\\) (\u2264 $4).  \n   Number of ways:  \n   \\[\n   \\binom{3}{2} \\cdot \\binom{4}{0} \\cdot \\binom{4}{1} = 3 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 4 = 12\n   \\]\n\n3. **(a=2, b=1, c=0):** 2 candy bars at 50 cents and 1 candy bar at $1.  \n   Cost: \\(2 \\cdot 0.5 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 2\\) (\u2264 $4).  \n   Number of ways:  \n   \\[\n   \\binom{3}{2} \\cdot \\binom{4}{1} \\cdot \\binom{4}{0} = 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 1 = 12\n   \\]\n\n4. **(a=1, b=1, c=1):** 1 candy bar at 50 cents, 1 at $1, and 1 at $2.  \n   Cost: \\(1 \\cdot 0.5 + 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 2 = 3.5\\) (\u2264 $4).  \n   Number of ways:  \n   \\[\n   \\binom{3}{1} \\cdot \\binom{4}{1} \\cdot \\binom{4}{1} = 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 4 = 48\n   \\]\n\n5. **(a=1, b=2, c=0):** 1 candy bar at 50 cents and 2 at $1.  \n   Cost: \\(1 \\cdot 0.5 + 2 \\cdot 1 = 2.5\\) (\u2264 $4).  \n   Number of ways:  \n   \\[\n   \\binom{3}{1} \\cdot \\binom{4}{2} \\cdot \\binom{4}{0} = 3 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 1 = 18\n   \\]\n\n6. **(a=0, b=2, c=1):** 2 candy bars at $1 and 1 at $2.  \n   Cost: \\(2 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 2 = 4\\) (\u2264 $4).  \n   Number of ways:  \n   \\[\n   \\binom{3}{0} \\cdot \\binom{4}{2} \\cdot \\binom{4}{1} = 1 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 4 = 24\n   \\]\n\n7. **(a=0, b=3, c=0):** 3 candy bars at $1.  \n   Cost: \\(3 \\cdot 1 = 3\\) (\u2264 $4).  \n   Number of ways:  \n   \\[\n   \\binom{3}{0} \\cdot \\binom{4}{3} \\cdot \\binom{4}{0} = 1 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 1 = 4\n   \\]\n\nAdding these, the total number of ways where the total cost is \u2264 $4 is:\n\n\\[\n1 + 12 + 12 + 48 + 18 + 24 + 4 = 119\n\\]\n\n### Number of Ways with Total Cost > $4\nThe total number of ways to select 3 candy bars is 165. Subtracting the number of ways where the total cost is \u2264 $4 gives:\n\n\\[\n165 - 119 = 46\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of ways to select 3 candy bars such that the total cost is more than $4 is **46**.\n\nAnswer: C",
