      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says, \"If one third of 3/4 of a number is 21. Then, find the number?\" Hmm, okay, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It's talking about a number, and we're given some fractions of that number. So, the number is unknown, and I have to find it based on the information provided.\n\nLet me represent the unknown number as 'x'. That's usually how I start with these kinds of problems. So, x is the number we're looking for.\n\nThe problem states that one third of 3/4 of x is equal to 21. Let me write that down as an equation. So, one third of (3/4 of x) equals 21. In mathematical terms, that's (1/3) * (3/4 * x) = 21.\n\nWait, maybe I should structure it more clearly. Let's compute the inner part first. 3/4 of x is (3/4)x. Then, one third of that would be (1/3) multiplied by (3/4)x.\n\nSo, putting it together: (1/3) * (3/4)x = 21. Let me compute the multiplication here. The fractions multiply as (1 * 3)/(3 * 4) = 3/12, which simplifies to 1/4. Oh, wait, that's right because 3 divided by 3 is 1, and 4 remains. So, the equation simplifies to (1/4)x = 21.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm doing that correctly. Let's compute (1/3) * (3/4). Multiply the numerators: 1 * 3 = 3. Multiply the denominators: 3 * 4 = 12. So, 3/12 reduces to 1/4. Yep, that's correct. So, (1/4)x = 21.\n\nNow, to find x, I need to solve for it. If (1/4)x is 21, then x is 21 multiplied by 4. Because 1/4 times x equals 21, so x equals 21 times 4. Let me calculate that. 21 * 4 is 84. So, x should be 84.\n\nLet me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, starting with the problem: (1/3) of (3/4 x) is 21. Breaking it down, (3/4 x) multiplied by (1/3) equals 21. The fractions multiply to 1/4, so 1/4 x = 21. Multiply both sides by 4: x = 84. That seems right.\n\nLooking at the options provided, option A is 84. So, the correct answer should be A.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me plug the number back into the original problem to verify. Let's take x = 84.\n\nFirst, 3/4 of 84: 84 divided by 4 is 21, multiplied by 3 gives 63. Then, one third of 63 is 21. Yes, that's correct. So, 21 equals 21. Everything checks out.\n",

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nAlright, so let's parse the sentence. The problem says one third of 3/4 of a number equals 21. Wait, so I need to translate this into a mathematical equation. Let me think. Let me denote the unknown number as, say, x.\n\nSo, the phrase \"3/4 of a number\" would be (3/4) multiplied by x, right? So that's (3/4)x. Then, the next part is \"one third of that.\" So one third of (3/4)x would be (1/3) multiplied by (3/4)x. So putting it together, (1/3)*(3/4)x equals 21.\n\nWait, let me write that out more clearly. So, (1/3) * (3/4) * x = 21. Now, I can simplify this equation. Let's compute the constants first. The 1/3 multiplied by 3/4. Hmm, the 3 in the numerator and the 3 in the denominator will cancel out. So, 1/3 times 3/4 is (1 * 3)/(3 *4) which simplifies to (1)/(4). Because 3/3 is 1, so we have 1/4.\n\nSo now, the equation becomes (1/4)x = 21. To solve for x, I need to get rid of the 1/4 that's multiplied by x. How do I do that? I can multiply both sides of the equation by 4. That should cancel out the 1/4 on the left side.\n\nSo, multiplying both sides by 4: 4*(1/4)x = 4*21. On the left, 4 times 1/4 is 1, so we're left with x. On the right, 4 times 21 is 84. So x equals 84. That's the number.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps. So, the initial equation was (1/3)*(3/4)x =21. Multiplying those fractions: 1/3 *3/4 is (1*3)/(3*4) = 3/12, which simplifies to 1/4. So yes, (1/4)x =21. Then x=21*4=84.
