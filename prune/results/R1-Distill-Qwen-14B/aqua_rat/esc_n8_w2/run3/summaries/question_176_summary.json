      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about Jerry buying a bond, and I need to figure out how much interest it's accrued at maturity. Let me try to break it down.\n\nHmm, the bond is a 1-year, $5,000 bond with a 12% annual interest rate, compounded every six months. Right, so compound interest. I remember the formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- P is the principal amount, which is $5,000 here.\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal), so 12% is 0.12.\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year. Since it's every six months, that's 2 times a year.\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years, which is 1 year here.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the interest accrued, not the total amount. So I think I need to calculate the total amount and then subtract the principal to get the interest.\n\nLet me plug the numbers into the formula. So P is 5000, r is 0.12, n is 2, t is 1.\n\nCalculating inside the parentheses first: 1 + (0.12/2) = 1 + 0.06 = 1.06.\n\nThen, nt is 2*1=2, so we raise 1.06 to the power of 2. What's 1.06 squared? Let me think, 1.06 * 1.06. 1 times 1 is 1, 1 times 0.06 is 0.06, 0.06 times 1 is 0.06, and 0.06 * 0.06 is 0.0036. Adding those up: 1 + 0.06 + 0.06 + 0.0036 = 1.1236.\n\nSo A = 5000 * 1.1236 = 5000 * 1.1236. Let me compute that. 5000 * 1 is 5000, 5000 * 0.12 is 600, 5000 * 0.0036 is 18. So 5000 + 600 is 5600, plus 18 is 5618.\n\nWait, wait, wait, no. Because 1.1236 is 1 + 0.1236, so 5000 * 0.1236 is the interest. Oh, right, because the total amount is principal plus interest. So the interest would be 5000 * 0.1236.\n\nAlternatively, I could compute 5000 * 1.1236 and then subtract 5000 to get the interest.\n\nBut let's calculate it step by step. 5000 multiplied by 1.1236. Let's compute 5000 * 1.1236:\n\nWell, 5000 * 1 = 5000. 5000 * 0.12 is 600. 5000 * 0.0036 is 18. So 5000 + 600 is 5600, plus 18 is 5618. So the total amount A is $5,618.\n\nSo the interest is 5618 minus 5000, which is 618. So the interest accrued is $618.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 618. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I apply the formula correctly? Because sometimes I get confused with the compounding periods. So the rate per period is 12% / 2 = 6% per half-year. And since it's compounded every six months, after one year, there are two compounding periods.\n\nSo for each period, the amount is multiplied by 1.06. After two periods, 1.06 * 1.06 = 1.1236, which matches what I did before.\n\nSo yes, 5000 * 1.1236 = 5618. Interest is 618. So the answer should be B) $618.\n",

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nAlright, the bond is a 1-year, $5,000 bond with an annual interest rate of 12%, but it's compounded every six months. Hmm, I remember that compound interest means the interest is calculated more frequently than once a year, right? So in this case, it's every six months. That probably means I'll have to calculate the interest twice, once after each six-month period.\n\nWait, but wait. Since it's a one-year bond, it's exactly two six-month periods. So the interest will be compounded twice. I think the formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nIn this problem, P is $5,000. The annual rate is 12%, which as a decimal is 0.12. It's compounded every six months, so n is 2. The time t is 1 year. \n\nSo plugging the numbers in: A = 5000 * (1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1). Let me calculate that. \n\nFirst, 0.12 divided by 2 is 0.06. Then, 2*1 is 2. So it's (1.06)^2 multiplied by 5000. \n\nWhat's 1.06 squared? Let me think: 1.06 times 1.06. Well, 1 times 1 is 1. 1 times 0.06 is 0.06, 0.06 times 1 is another 0.06, and 0.06 times 0.06 is 0.0036. So adding them up: 1 + 0.06 + 0.06 + 0.0036 = 1.1236. \n\nSo A = 5000 * 1.1236. Let me do that multiplication. 5000 * 1 is 5000, 5000 * 0.1236 is 618. So 5000 + 618 is $5,618. \n\nWait, but the question asks for the interest accrued, not the total amount. So the interest is the total amount minus the principal. That would be 5618 - 5000 = $618. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is $618. So that must be the answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through the steps again. \n\nThe interest is compounded semi-annually, so each six months, 6% is added. So first six months: 5000 * 0.06 = 300. New amount is 5300. Next six months: 5300 * 0.06 = 318. So total interest is 300 + 318 = 618. Yep, that matches. So the answer is B.\n",
