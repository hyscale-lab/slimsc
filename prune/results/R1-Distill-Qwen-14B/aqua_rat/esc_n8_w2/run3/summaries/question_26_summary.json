      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a retailer selling an appliance. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says the retailer sold the appliance for 40 percent above cost, and that represented a gross profit of $20.00. I need to find out the selling price.\n\nWait, let me make sure I understand the terms. Gross profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price, right? So if the selling price is 40% above cost, then that 40% is the profit. Oh wait, no, wait. Because 40% above cost means that the selling price is 140% of the cost. So the cost is the original amount, and 40% more than that is the selling price.\n\nLet me think about it. Let's denote the cost as C. Then the selling price would be C plus 40% of C, which is 1.4 * C. The gross profit is the difference between selling price and cost, so it's 1.4C - C = 0.4C. And the problem says this gross profit is $20. So 0.4C = 20.\n\nOh, so to find C, I can divide both sides by 0.4. So C = 20 / 0.4. Let's calculate that. 20 divided by 0.4. Hmm, 0.4 is the same as 2/5, so dividing by 2/5 is multiplying by 5/2. 20 * 5/2 is 50. So the cost is $50.\n\nWait, but wait a second. So the selling price is 40% above cost, which would be 50 + 20 = $70. Because 40% of 50 is 20. So the selling price is $70.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is $70.00. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Sometimes these problems can be tricky with the percentages. Let me verify.\n\nIf the cost is $50, then 40% above cost is 50 * 1.4 = 70. The profit is 70 - 50 = 20, which matches the given information. So yes, everything checks out.\n",

So, the question is about a retailer who sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, and that 40 percent represents a gross profit of $20.00. I need to find out what price the retailer sold the appliance for. The options are A to E, and I have to pick the correct one.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. First, I remember that gross profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price. So, if the retailer made a $20 gross profit, that means selling price minus cost equals $20. \n\nWait, the question says the selling price was 40% above cost. Oh, right, so the selling price is 140% of the cost. Because 100% is the cost, and 40% above that would be 140%. So, mathematically, selling price = cost + 40% of cost, which is 1.4 * cost.\n\nBut wait, the 40% above cost is the gross profit, or is it the markup? Hmm, no, wait, no. Wait, the selling price is 40% above cost. So, for example, if cost is C, then selling price is C plus 40% of C, which is 1.4C. So, the gross profit is 0.4C, which is $20.\n\nOh, okay, so 0.4C = $20. That makes sense. So, to find C, the cost, I can rearrange this. C = $20 / 0.4. Let me calculate that. 20 divided by 0.4 is... 20 divided by 0.4 is 50, right? Because 0.4 times 50 is 20. So, the cost is $50.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the selling price. The selling price is 1.4 times the cost. So, 1.4 * 50 equals... 70. Because 1 times 50 is 50, and 0.4 times 50 is 20, so together 70. So, the selling price is $70. \n\nLooking at the options, option D is $70. So, that must be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If the cost is $50, and the selling price is $70, then the profit is $20, which is 40% of the cost. Because 40% of 50 is 20.
