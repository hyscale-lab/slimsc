      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to solve this problem. So, the father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan, who are currently 23 and 24 years old. The division is such that when their shares are invested at 4% compound interest, they'll have equal amounts when they turn 26. I need to find out how much Mohan gets.\n\nHmm, so the key here is that the present amounts they receive will grow to the same future value when they're 26. Since they're both getting their shares now, the time each amount will be invested is different. Mohan is 23, so he has 3 years until he's 26. Sohan is 24, so he has 2 years until 26.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, no, because the shares are given now. So when the father divides the money, each son gets a certain amount immediately. They invest these amounts at 4% compound interest. Then, when each son turns 26, their investments will have grown, and those future values should be equal.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because the problem says that the shares are invested, and when they attain 26, the amount they receive is equal. So the future amounts should be the same for both.\n\nWait, but the sons are getting their shares now, and each will invest their own share. So for each son, the investment grows for a certain number of years until they turn 26.\n\nMohan is 23 now, so in 3 years he'll be 26. Sohan is 24 now, so in 2 years he'll be 26.\n\nSo the idea is that the amount Mohan gets (let's call it M) will be invested for 3 years, and Sohan's share (S) will be invested for 2 years. The future values of these investments must be equal.\n\nSo, the formula for compound interest is A = P*(1 + r)^t, where A is the amount, P is principal, r is rate, t is time.\n\nSo, for Mohan: A_m = M*(1.04)^3\n\nFor Sohan: A_s = S*(1.04)^2\n\nAnd we set these equal: M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2\n\nBut also, the total amount M + S = 5100.\n\nSo, I can write M + S = 5100.\n\nFrom the first equation: M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2 \u2192 M/S = (1.04)^2 / (1.04)^3 \u2192 M/S = 1/(1.04) \u2192 M = S/(1.04)\n\nWait, wait, let me double-check that. Let me rearrange the equation:\n\nM*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2 \u2192 Divide both sides by (1.04)^2: M*(1.04) = S \u2192 So M = S/(1.04)\n\nHmm, or perhaps another way: Let's divide both sides by S and (1.04)^2.\n\nM/S = (1.04)^2 / (1.04)^3 \u2192 (1.04)^(2-3) = (1.04)^(-1) \u2192 1/(1.04) \u2192 So M/S = 1/(1.04) \u2192 M = S/(1.04)\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo M = S/(1.04)\n\nThen, since M + S = 5100, substitute M:\n\nS/(1.04) + S = 5100 \u2192 S (1/(1.04) + 1) = 5100 \u2192 Let's compute that.\n\n1/(1.04) is approximately 0.9615, so 0.9615 + 1 = 1.9615. So S * 1.9615 = 5100 \u2192 S \u2248 5100 / 1.9615.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to compute it exactly. Let me compute 1/(1.04) as a fraction.\n\n1.04 is 104/100, so 1/1.04 is 100/104 = 25/26.\n\nSo, 1/(1.04) is 25/26.\n\nSo, S*(25/26 + 1) = 5100 \u2192 25/26 + 26/26 = 51/26 \u2192 So S * (51/26) = 5100.\n\nWait, that's better.\n\nSo, S = 5100 * (26/51).\n\n5100 divided by 51 is 100. So 100 *26 = 2600.\n\nSo S = 2600.\n\nWait, but wait. So Sohan's share is 2600, and Mohan's share is M = S/(1.04) \u2192 2600 / 1.04.\n\nLet me compute that: 2600 divided by 1.04.\n\n1.04 \u00d7 2500 = 2600. Because 2500 \u00d7 1.04 = 2500 + 100 = 2600.\n\nWait, because 1% of 2500 is 25, so 4% is 100. So 2500 + 100 = 2600. So yes, 2500 \u00d7 1.04 is 2600. So 2600 / 1.04 is 2500.\n\nSo M is 2500.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the math again.\n\nWait, if S = 2600, and M = 2500, then the total is 2500 +2600 = 5100. That matches.\n\nSo, Sohan's share is 2600, and Mohan's is 2500.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for Mohan's share. So the answer would be 2500. Looking at the options, option B is 2500.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I make a mistake.\n\nSo, the key steps are:\n\n1. Let M = Mohan's share, S = Sohan's share.\n\n2. M + S = 5100.\n\n3. M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2 \u2192 M = S*(1.04)^2 / (1.04)^3 \u2192 M = S/(1.04)\n\nWait, no, let me re-derive this step.\n\nM*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2 \u2192 Dividing both sides by (1.04)^2, we get M*(1.04) = S \u2192 So M = S / 1.04.\n\nYes.\n\nThen, substituting M into M + S =5100:\n\nS/1.04 + S =5100 \u2192 S(1 + 1/1.04) = 5100.\n\nWait, 1 + 1/1.04 is 1 + 25/26 = (26 +25)/26 =51/26.\n\nSo S = 5100 * (26/51) = 100 *26 =2600.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, Sohan's share is 2600, Mohan's is 2500.\n\nSo the correct option is B)2500.\n",

The division is such that when their shares are invested at a 4% compound interest rate, they'll get equal amounts when they turn 26. I need to find Mohan's share.\n\nHmm, let me think. So the main idea is that both sons will receive the same amount when they're 26, but they have different current ages. So their investment periods are different. I remember that compound interest can be calculated with the formula A = P*(1 + r/100)^t, where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the rate, and t is the time in years.\n\nMohan is 23 now, so he'll turn 26 in 3 years. Sohan is 24, so he'll reach 26 in 2 years. The father divides 5100 into two parts, say P1 for Mohan and P2 for Sohan. After their respective periods, the amounts should be equal.\n\nSo, the equation would be: P1*(1.04)^3 = P2*(1.04)^2.\n\nAlso, P1 + P2 = 5100.\n\nLet me write that down.\n\nP1 * (1.04)^3 = P2 * (1.04)^2\nP1 + P2 = 5100.\n\nI can simplify this. Let's compute the ratio between P1 and P2. From the first equation,\n\nP1 / P2 = (1.04)^2 / (1.04)^3 = 1/(1.04).\n\nSo P1 = P2 / 1.04.\n\nWait, no. Wait, because (1.04)^3 is (1.04)^2 * 1.04. So when I divide both sides by (1.04)^2, I get P1*(1.04) = P2. So P2 = P1 * 1.04.\n\nSo, substituting into the second equation: P1 + P1*1.04 = 5100.\n\nFactor out P1: P1*(1 + 1.04) = 5100.\n\nWhich is P1 * 2.04 = 5100.\n\nSo P1 = 5100 / 2.04.\n\nLet me compute that. 5100 divided by 2.04. Hmm, 2.04 times 2500 is 5100 because 2.04 * 2500 = 5100. Because 2500 * 2 is 5000, and 2500 * 0.04 is 100, so together 5100. So P1 is 2500. That would be Mohan's share.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nP1*(1.04)^3 = P2*(1.04)^2\n\nDivide both sides by (1.04)^2:\n\nP1*(1.04) = P2\n\nSo P2 = P1 * 1.04\n\nSum is P1 + P2 = 5100\n\nWhich is P1 + 1.04 P1 = 5100\n\nP1 (1 + 1.04) = 5100\n\nP1 (2.04) = 5100\n\nSo P1 = 5100 / 2.04 = 2500.\n\nYes, that's correct. So Mohan gets 2500, Sohan gets 2500 *1.04= 2600. Let me check the sum: 2500 + 2600 = 5100. Yep, that adds up.\n\nWait, but wait again. Are we considering that both will receive equal amounts at 26, which is the time when the interest is compounded. So the future amounts are equal. So the present values (their shares) are P1 and P2, which when invested give the same amount.\n\nSo, the answer should be 2500, which is option B.\n",

After their respective periods, the amounts should be equal.\n\nSo, the equation would be: P1*(1.04)^3 = P2*(1.04)^2.\n\nAlso, P1 + P2 = 5100.\n\nLet me write that down.\n\nP1 * (1.04)^3 = P2 * (1.04)^2\nP1 + P2 = 5100.\n\nI can simplify this. Let's compute the ratio between P1 and P2. From the first equation,\n\nP1 / P2 = (1.04)^2 / (1.04)^3 = 1/(1.04).\n\nSo P1 = P2 / 1.04.\n\nWait, no. Wait, because (1.04)^3 is (1.04)^2 * 1.04. So when I divide both sides by (1.04)^2, I get P1*(1.04) = P2. So P2 = P1 * 1.04.\n\nSo, substituting into the second equation: P1 + P1*1.04 = 5100.\n\nFactor out P1: P1*(1 + 1.04) = 5100.\n\nWhich is P1 * 2.04 = 5100.\n\nSo P1 = 5100 / 2.04.\n\nLet me compute that. 5100 divided by 2.04. Hmm, 2.04 times 2500 is 5100 because 2.04 * 2500 = 5100. Because 2500 * 2 is 5000, and 2500 * 0.04 is 100, so together 5100. So P1 is 2500. That would be Mohan's share.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nP1*(1.04)^3 = P2*(1.04)^2\n\nDivide both sides by (1.04)^2:\n\nP1*(1.04) = P2\n\nSo P2 = P1 * 1.04\n\nSum is P1 + P2 = 5100\n\nWhich is P1 + 1.04 P1 = 5100\n\nP1 (1 + 1.04) = 5100\n\nP1 (2.04) = 5100\n\nSo P1 = 5100 / 2.04 = 2500.\n\nYes, that's correct. So Mohan gets 2500, Sohan gets 2500 *1.04= 2600. Let me check the sum: 2500 + 2600 = 5100. Yep, that adds up.\n\nWait, but wait again. Are we considering that both will receive equal amounts at 26, which is the time when the interest is compounded. So the future amounts are equal. So the present values (their shares) are P1 and P2, which when invested give the same amount.\n\nSo, the answer should be 2500, which is option B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine how the father divides Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan, such that their shares, when invested at 4% compound interest, yield equal amounts when they turn 26 years old.\n\n### Key Information:\n1. **Ages of the sons**: Mohan is 23, and Sohan is 24.\n2. **Investment periods**:\n   - Mohan will turn 26 in 3 years.\n   - Sohan will turn 26 in 2 years.\n3. **Compound interest formula**:  \n   \\[\n   A = P \\times (1 + \\frac{r}{100})^t\n   \\]\n   where \\(A\\) is the final amount, \\(P\\) is the principal, \\(r\\) is the annual interest rate (4%), and \\(t\\) is the time in years.\n\n### Let:\n- \\(P_1\\) = Mohan's share.\n- \\(P_2\\) = Sohan's share.\n\n### Conditions:\n1. The final amounts for both sons must be equal:\n   \\[\n   P_1 \\times (1.04)^3 = P_2 \\times (1.04)^2\n   \\]\n2. The total amount is Rs. 5100:\n   \\[\n   P_1 + P_2 = 5100\n   \\]\n\n### Solving the Equations:\nFrom the first equation:\n\\[\nP_1 \\times (1.04)^3 = P_2 \\times (1.04)^2\n\\]\nDivide both sides by \\((1.04)^2\\):\n\\[\nP_1 \\times 1.04 = P_2\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\nP_2 = P_1 \\times 1.04\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(P_2 = P_1 \\times 1.04\\) into the second equation:\n\\[\nP_1 + P_1 \\times 1.04 = 5100\n\\]\nFactor out \\(P_1\\):\n\\[\nP_1 \\times (1 + 1.04) = 5100\n\\]\n\\[\nP_1 \\times 2.04 = 5100\n\\]\nSolve for \\(P_1\\):\n\\[\nP_1 = \\frac{5100}{2.04} = 2500\n\\]\n\n### Verification:\n- Mohan's share (\\(P_1\\)) = Rs. 2500.\n- Sohan's share (\\(P_2\\)) = \\(P_1 \\times 1.04 = 2500 \\times 1.04 = 2600\\).\n- Total = \\(2500 + 2600 = 5100\\), which matches the given total.\n\nThus, Mohan's share is Rs. 2500.\n\nAnswer: B",
