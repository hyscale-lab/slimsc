      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about discounts on tyres. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the manufacturer is offering a 20% discount, and a retailer is giving an additional 20% off. I need to find the total discount. Hmm, I remember that when discounts are applied successively, you can't just add them up. Because the second discount is applied after the first one has already reduced the price.\n\nWait, right. So the first discount is 20%, so the customer pays 80% of the original price. Then the retailer gives another 20% off on that already discounted price. So I think the total discount isn't 40%, which would be adding 20 and 20. That's a common mistake, but I think it's not the case here.\n\nLet me think of it with numbers. Suppose the original price of the tyre is $100. Okay, so the manufacturer's discount is 20%, which is $20. So the price after the manufacturer's discount is $80.\n\nNow the retailer gives an additional 20% off. But wait, that 20% is off the discounted price, right? So 20% of $80 is $16. So the new price after the retailer's discount is $80 minus $16, which is $64.\n\nSo the total amount paid is $64. The original was $100, so the total discount is $36. That's 36% of the original price. So the total discount available is 36%.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So 20% off the original, then another 20% off the new price. So the first discount brings it to 80, then 20% off 80 is 16, so 80 minus 16 is 64. 100 minus 64 is 36. Yep, that's right.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 36%. So the correct answer should be E.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about discounts on tyres, and I need to figure out the total discount when a retailer adds their own discount on top of the manufacturer's discount. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nSo the manufacturer is offering a 20% discount on tubeless tyres. Then, some retailers are giving additional discounts. The question is specifically about a retailer that offers an extra 20% off. Wait, but I have to be careful here because discounts don't just add up linearly, right? Like, if one gives 20% and another gives 20%, it's not as simple as adding them to get 40% off. I remember that the way discounts stack is a bit more involved.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's say the original price of the tyre is $100. That makes the math easier. So the manufacturer's discount is 20%, which would take the price down by $20, making it $80. So after the manufacturer's discount, it's $80.\n\nNow, the retailer is offering an additional 20% discount. But wait, is this 20% off the original price or off the already discounted price? I think it's the latter because usually, when a retailer offers a discount, it's on top of any existing discounts. So in this case, the retailer's 20% would be applied to the $80 price.\n\nSo 20% of $80 is 0.2 * 80 = $16. So the retailer's discount brings the price down by another $16. So the final price would be $80 - $16 = $64.\n\nNow, the original price was $100, and now it's $64. So the total discount is $36. To find the percentage discount, I take (36 / 100) * 100% = 36%. Wait, but looking at the options, E is 36%, which would be the total discount. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought sometimes people might think adding the percentages, but that's not how it works.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Another way to calculate this is to consider the combined discount. The manufacturer gives a 20% discount, so the customer pays 80% of the original. Then the retailer gives another 20% off on that already discounted price, so the customer pays 80% of the 80% price. So the total is 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64, which is 64% of the original price. So the total discount is 100% - 64% = 36%, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nBut wait, the options don't have 36% as the first choice. Let me look back. Oh, the options are A)10%, B)25%, C)28%, D)30%, E)36%. So E is 36%, which is the correct total discount. But wait, the question says \"what is the total discount available at that retailer?\" So is the total discount 36%? That would make the answer E.\n\nBut wait, another way people might approach this is to think the discounts add up. So 20% plus 20% would be 40% off. But that's not correct because the second discount is applied after the first. So 20% off, then another 20% off the new price. So the total discount is more than 20% but less than 40%, which 36% is.\n\nSo the answer should be E)36%. But wait, let me think again. Let me take another example. If the original price is $200. Manufacturer's discount is 20%, so $200 - 40 = $160. Retailer's 20% off $160 is 32. So total price is 160 -32 =128. Original is 200, so discount is 72. 72/200 = 0.36, which is 36% discount. So yes, that's consistent.\n\nSo the correct answer is E)36%.\n",
