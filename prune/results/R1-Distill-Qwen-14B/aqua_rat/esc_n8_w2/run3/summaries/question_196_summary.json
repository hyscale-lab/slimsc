      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about electric poles and trees casting shadows. Hmm, I think I need to use some math to solve it. Let me see... Oh right, similar triangles maybe? Because when the sun's rays hit the pole and the tree, the angles should be the same, making the triangles similar.\n\nThe electric pole is 14 meters high and casts a shadow of 10 meters. So the pole is like the vertical side, and the shadow is the horizontal side. Then, the tree's height would be the other vertical side, and its shadow is 15 meters. Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides should be equal.\n\nWait, so I can set up a proportion here. The ratio of the pole's height to its shadow should be the same as the tree's height to its shadow. So 14/10 equals tree height/15.\n\nLet me write that down: 14/10 = h/15, where h is the tree's height. To solve for h, I can cross-multiply. So 14 * 15 equals 10 * h. Let me calculate that. 14 times 15 is... 210, right? And 10 times h is 10h. So 210 = 10h. Dividing both sides by 10 gives h = 21.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. If the pole is 14 with a 10m shadow, the tree is taller because its shadow is longer. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, longer shadow would mean the object is taller, right? Because if the sun is lower, the shadow is longer, but wait no, in similar conditions, the sun's angle is the same. So if the shadow is longer, the object must be taller.\n\nWait, so in our calculation, 14/10 = h/15. Let me compute 14 *15. 14*10 is 140, plus 14*5=70, so 210. 10h =210 \u2192 h=21. So the tree is 21 meters tall. Looking at the options, option A is 21. So that should be the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't flip the ratio. Oh, no, because the ratio is height to shadow. So pole's height divided by pole's shadow equals tree's height divided by tree's shadow. So yes, 14/10 = h/15.\n\nHmm, another way to think about it: The ratio of height to shadow is 14:10, which simplifies to 7:5. So for every 5 meters of shadow, the height is 7. So if the shadow is 15, which is 3 times 5, then the height is 3 times 7, which is 21. Yeah, same answer.\n",

I remember that when objects cast shadows, the lengths of the shadows and their heights are related by similar triangles or something like that. Oh right, similar triangles because the sun's rays are coming at the same angle for both objects, so their heights and shadow lengths are proportional.\n\nThe problem says an electric pole that's 14 meters high casts a shadow of 10 meters. I need to find the height of a tree that casts a 15-meter shadow under the same conditions. So, similar triangles\u2014so the ratio of the pole's height to its shadow should be the same as the tree's height to its shadow.\n\nLet me write that down. So for the electric pole, height is 14 m, shadow is 10 m. So the ratio is 14/10. For the tree, let's say the height is h and the shadow is 15 m. So the ratio would be h/15. Since the ratios are equal, I can set them equal to each other.\n\nSo 14/10 = h/15. To find h, I can cross-multiply. 14 * 15 = 10 * h. Let's calculate that. 14 times 15 is... 14*10 is 140, 14*5 is 70, so 140+70 is 210. So 210 = 10h. Then h would be 210 divided by 10, which is 21. So h is 21 meters. Looking at the options, option A is 21.\n\nWait, wait a second. Did I do that right? Let me double-check. 14 divided by 10 is 1.4. So if the tree's shadow is 15, then the height should be 1.4 times 15. 1.4 times 10 is 14, and 1.4 times 5 is 7, so 14+7 is 21. Yep, that's the same answer. So the tree must be 21 meters tall. So the correct option is A.\n",
