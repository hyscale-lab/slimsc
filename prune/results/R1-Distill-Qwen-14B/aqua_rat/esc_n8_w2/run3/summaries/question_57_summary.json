      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a hollow cube, and I'm trying to figure out how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted after the outer surface is painted. Let's see... Hmm, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the cube is hollow, right? And it's 5cm in size, but with a thickness of 1cm. So, wait, does that mean each edge of the cube is 5cm long? Oh, yes, because the size refers to the edge length. And each small cube is 1cm in size, so they're 1x1x1 cubes.\n\nSo the big cube is made up of smaller cubes. Since it's a hollow cube, I think only the outer layer is there, and the inside is empty. Wait, no. Wait, the thickness is 1cm, so the hollow part is 1cm thick. So the cube has an outer shell of 1cm thickness, and the inner part is empty. So the overall size is 5cm, but the hollow part is 5cm minus 2 times the thickness? No, wait. Let me think: the thickness is 1cm on each side, so the inner hollow cube would be 5 - 2*1 = 3cm on each edge. Because each side (left and right, top and bottom, front and back) has a 1cm thick layer. So the hollow part is 3x3x3 cubes, and the outer shell is the remaining.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the cube is hollow, made of smaller cubes. So the total number of small cubes is the total in the 5x5x5 cube minus the inner 3x3x3. So that would be 125 (5^3) minus 27 (3^3) which is 98 small cubes. But wait, the question is about the painted faces, not the number of small cubes. Hmm.\n\nWait, the question says, \"how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted?\" So each small cube has up to three faces exposed, but since the big cube is hollow, some might be on the inside.\n\nWait, no, because the big cube is hollow, the inner part is empty. So the small cubes are only on the surface. Wait, but the thickness is 1cm, so perhaps it's a cube that's 5cm on each edge, with the outer 1cm layer made up of small cubes, and the inside is empty. So the total number of small cubes is 5x5x5 minus 3x3x3, which is 125-27=98 cubes.\n\nBut wait, no, the question says it's made of smaller cubes of size 1cm, so perhaps the hollow cube is constructed as a shell, and the inside is empty. So each face of the big cube is a 5x5 grid of small cubes, but since the thickness is 1cm, each face's outer layer is 1cm, so the inner part is 3x3x3.\n\nWait, but no. The way the problem is phrased: it's a hollow cube of size 5cm, with thickness 1cm. So the cube is 5cm on each edge, but each face is a 5x5 grid of small cubes, each 1cm. So the cube is built with layers. The outermost layer is 1cm thick, so the inner part is 3cm on each edge, but since it's hollow, the inner part is empty.\n\nWait, perhaps I should visualize this. The big cube is 5x5x5, but the hollow part is a 3x3x3 cube inside, so the small cubes are only on the outer layer.\n\nSo each face of the big cube is a 5x5 grid of small cubes. Each small cube on the surface will have at least one face painted. But some will have two or three faces painted, like the edges and corners.\n\nBut the question is about the total number of faces that are unpainted. Wait, each small cube has 6 faces. Some of those faces are on the outside and get painted, others are either on the inside (but since the cube is hollow, those are not painted) or are glued to adjacent small cubes (so those faces are also not painted).\n\nWait, no, the outer surface is painted, so any face of a small cube that's on the exterior of the big cube will be painted. The other faces, either they are internal (between small cubes) or on the inside of the hollow part.\n\nWait, but since the cube is hollow, the inner surfaces of the hollow part are not painted. So for the small cubes on the outer layer, their inner faces (facing the hollow) are not painted. So for each small cube in the shell, any face that's pointing into the hollow is unpainted, but the other faces might be either painted or adjacent to another small cube (so not painted).\n\nSo the approach is to count all the faces of all the small cubes that are on the inside of the hollow part, and add those to the faces that are between small cubes (i.e., not on the exterior of the big cube).\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to calculate the total number of small cube faces and subtract the ones that are painted.\n\nEach small cube has 6 faces. There are 98 small cubes in the shell (as calculated before: 5^3 -3^3=125-27=98). So the total number of faces is 98 *6=588.\n\nNow, how many of these are painted? The painted faces are those on the exterior of the big cube. The big cube has 6 faces, each 5x5, so 25 small faces per face. So 6*25=150 small cube faces are painted.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Each face of the big cube is 5x5, so 25 small cube faces, and each of these is painted. So 6*25=150 painted small cube faces.\n\nSo the total painted is 150. So the unpainted faces would be total faces (588) minus painted (150) equals 438.\n\nWait, but wait. That would give 588-150=438, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because some of the small cube faces are on the inner side of the hollow cube. Those are not painted, right? So when I subtract only the painted ones, I'm leaving the inner faces and the glued faces as unpainted.\n\nWait, but in my initial approach, I assumed that the total faces are 588, of which 150 are painted, and the rest are unpainted. But that might not be correct because some of the small cube faces are internal (i.e., between two small cubes) and others are on the inner hollow side.\n\nWait, but when I count the total faces, each small cube has 6, but in the shell structure, some faces are glued to another cube (so they are internal), and others are on the outside (painted) or on the inner hollow (unpainted).\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: for each small cube in the shell, how many of its faces are unpainted.\n\nEach small cube can be in a corner, edge, face, or just somewhere in the shell.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to calculate the total number of unpainted faces.\n\nWait, the unpainted faces are those that are either inside the hollow (facing the empty space) or glued to another small cube (so not part of the exterior or the hollow).\n\nWait, but perhaps for each small cube, the number of unpainted faces is equal to the number of its faces that are not on the exterior. So for each small cube, the number of faces painted is the number of exterior faces it has. The unpainted ones are the others.\n\nSo for each small cube, the number of painted faces is 1, 2, or 3, depending on whether it's on a corner, edge, or face.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to calculate the total number of unpainted faces as the total number of faces minus the painted ones. Wait, but that's what I did earlier. Hmm.\n\nWait, earlier I calculated that total small cube faces are 588, and 150 are painted, so 438 unpainted. So the answer would be A)438.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The hollow cube has an inner part. The small cubes in the shell have some faces pointing into the hollow. Those are also unpainted. So the total unpainted faces would be the sum of all the inner faces of the shell and the glued faces.\n\nWait, but when I calculated 588-150=438, that includes both the internal glued faces and the inner hollow faces.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should double-check.\n\nEach small cube in the shell has 6 faces. The number of these that are on the exterior (and thus painted) is variable, but the sum of all the painted faces is 150 (since 6 faces of big cube, each with 25 small faces).\n\nSo the unpainted faces are 588-150=438. So the answer is A)438.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about it another way. The total number of small cube faces is 98 *6=588.\n\nThe painted ones are 6 faces of the big cube, each 5x5, so 6*25=150. So 150 painted.\n\nSo unpainted is 588-150=438.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. Another approach is to calculate how many small cube faces are on the inside of the hollow.\n\nThe hollow is a 3x3x3 cube. Each face of that hollow cube is 3x3=9 small cube faces. But since the hollow is inside the shell, each face of the hollow is surrounded by small cubes in the shell. So each face of the hollow has 9 small cube faces that are on the inside of the shell, and thus unpainted.\n\nThere are 6 faces on the hollow cube, so 6*9=54 small cube faces that are inside the hollow and unpainted.\n\nAdditionally, the small cubes in the shell have faces glued to each other. Each such glued face is shared between two small cubes, so each contributes two unpainted faces. But wait, no. When two small cubes are adjacent, their shared face is not painted, but each cube's face is part of their own count. So for each glued face, two faces (one from each cube) are unpainted.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the number of glued faces. The total number of glued faces is the number of adjacent small cubes in the shell.\n\nBut that might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to proceed with the first method.\n\nWait, in the first approach, the total unpainted is 438, which includes both the inner hollow faces and the glued faces.\n\nBut perhaps I can compute it another way to confirm.\n\nThe total unpainted faces would be the sum of the internal faces (the hollow) and the internal glued faces between small cubes.\n\nThe hollow contributes 6*(3^2) =54 unpainted faces.\n\nThe glued faces are the number of adjacent small cube faces within the shell. How many are there?\n\nThe shell is a cube of 5x5x5, but with a 3x3x3 hollow inside. So the number of small cubes in the shell is 98, as before.\n\nIn a cube, the number of adjacent face pairs can be calculated based on the structure.\n\nIn a cube of size N, the number of adjacent face pairs (i.e., shared between two cubes) is 3*(N-1)^2*(N). Wait, perhaps another approach.\n\nWait, for a cube, each face has (n-1)*(n-1) internal edges, leading to (n-1)^2 face adjacents per face. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the number of internal glued faces in the shell can be calculated as the number of glued faces in a 5x5x5 cube minus the glued faces in the 3x3x3 cube.\n\nWait, because the shell is the 5x5x5 minus the 3x3x3, so the glued faces in the shell would be the glued faces of the 5x5x5 cube minus those of the 3x3x3.\n\nWait, but in the 5x5x5 cube, the number of glued face pairs is 3*(5-1)*5*(5) for each dimension? Hmm, perhaps that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, another way: each glued face is shared between two small cubes, so the number of glued faces in a cube of size L x L x L is (L-1)*L^2 * 3. Because for each of the three dimensions, each layer has (L-1) connections per line.\n\nWait, in a cube of size L, the number of internal glued faces is 3*(L-1)*L^2. Because for each of the three dimensions (x, y, z), each layer has L^2 cubes, and (L-1) connections along each dimension.\n\nSo for a 5x5x5 cube, it's 3*(5-1)*5^2 = 3*4*25= 300.\n\nSimilarly, for a 3x3x3 cube, it's 3*(3-1)*3^2 =3*2*9=54.\n\nSo the number of glued faces in the shell would be 300 (from 5x5x5) minus 54 (from 3x3x3) = 246.\n\nBut wait, each glued face is counted once in this calculation, but each represents two faces (one from each cube) being glued. So the total number of glued small cube faces is 246*2=492? Wait, no, because each glued face is a shared face between two small cubes, so each such glued face contributes two unpainted faces (each cube's face). So the total number of glued unpainted faces is 246 * 2? No, because when you count the number of glued face adjacencies, each adjacency represents two faces, so the number of glued faces is 246, but each contributes two unpainted faces, so 246*2=492.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: when two small cubes are adjacent, their shared face is a single glued face. But each cube has a face in that glued position. So each glued face contributes two unpainted faces, one from each cube.\n\nSo the total number of glued unpainted faces is the number of glued face adjacencies multiplied by two.\n\nIn the 5x5x5 cube, the number of glued face adjacencies is 3*(5-1)*5^2 = 300. So the number of glued faces (each representing two unpainted faces) is 300, leading to 300*2=600. But wait, no, that can't be right because each glued face is counted once in the 300, but each contributes two faces.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of glued face adjacencies is 3*(5-1)*5^2 =3*4*25=300. Each adjacency represents a single glued face, which is two small cube faces. So the total number of glued small cube faces is 300*2=600.\n\nSimilarly, for the 3x3x3 cube, the number of glued face adjacencies is 3*(3-1)*3^2 =3*2*9=54, leading to 54*2=108 glued small cube faces.\n\nSo the glued faces in the shell (the 5x5x5 minus 3x3x3) would be 600 (from 5x5x5) minus 108 (from 3x3x3) = 492.\n\nSo the number of glued faces in the shell is 492.\n\nWait, but wait, this is the number of small cube faces that are glued to another cube and thus unpainted. So 492 is the number of glued unpainted faces.\n\nAdditionally, the hollow contributes 54 unpainted faces (each face of the hollow is 3x3, 6 faces, so 54).\n\nSo the total unpainted faces would be 492 (glued) +54 (hollow) =546.\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated 588-150=438. So now I'm getting a different number.\n\nHmm, so that's a problem. There's a contradiction here. Which approach is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in one of the approaches. Let me re-examine.\n\nIn the first approach, total small cube faces: 98 *6=588.\n\nPainted faces: 6*5*5=150.\n\nUnpainted: 588-150=438.\n\nIn the second approach, I calculated glued faces as 492 and hollow faces as 54, totaling 546. But 546 is larger than 438, which can't be right because 546 is more than the total unpainted faces.\n\nSo where's the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm double-counting. Let me think again.\n\nWait, when I compute the glued faces in the shell as 492, that's the number of small cube faces that are glued to another cube. But each glued face is counted once for each cube. So, for example, if cube A is glued to cube B, then cube A has one face glued, and cube B has one face glued. So in the 5x5x5 cube, the number of glued face adjacencies is 300 (as before), and each represents two small cube faces. So the number of glued small cube faces is 300*2=600.\n\nSimilarly, for the 3x3x3, it's 54*2=108.\n\nSo in the shell, the glued small cube faces would be 600 (from 5x5x5) minus 108 (from 3x3x3) =492.\n\nBut each of these 492 is a face that is glued to another cube, so they are unpainted.\n\nAdditionally, the hollow's faces: each face of the hollow is 3x3, so 6*9=54. These are the small cube faces that are pointing into the hollow and are thus unpainted.\n\nSo the total unpainted faces would be 492 (glued) +54 (hollow) =546.\n\nBut earlier, I have 588-150=438. So why the discrepancy?\n\nAh, perhaps the problem is that when I subtract the painted faces from the total, I'm not considering that the hollow faces are part of the small cube's faces that are not painted, but in the initial approach, they are included in the 588 total.\n\nWait, the initial approach:\n\nTotal small cube faces: 98 *6 =588.\n\nPainted:150.\n\nUnpainted:588-150=438.\n\nBut according to the second approach, the unpainted is 546. So which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the second approach is overcounting. Let me think about it again.\n\nEach small cube in the shell has some faces:\n\n- Some are on the exterior and thus painted (1, 2, or 3 faces).\n\n- Some are glued to another cube (so not painted).\n\n- Some are on the inner side of the shell (facing the hollow), so not painted.\n\nSo for each small cube, the number of unpainted faces is:\n\n6 (total) - number of exterior faces (painted) - number of glued faces (interior to the shell).\n\nWait, but no, because the glued faces are also part of the shell's interior. So perhaps each small cube in the shell has some faces that are exterior (painted), some glued to another cube (unpainted), and some glued to the hollow (unpainted).\n\nWait, but the hollow is empty. So the faces of the small cubes that are on the inside of the shell are not glued to anything; they're just facing the hollow. So those are unpainted.\n\nSo for each small cube in the shell:\n\npainted_faces = number of exterior faces (could be 1, 2, or 3)\n\nunpainted_faces = 6 - painted_faces.\n\nBut the unpainted_faces include both the glued faces to other cubes and the faces pointing into the hollow.\n\nWait, but in reality, the small cube in the shell can be on the corner, edge, or face.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: For each small cube, determine how many of its faces are unpainted.\n\nBut that might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach is correct, and the second approach has a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the second approach double-counts some faces. Let me think: when I calculate the glued face adjacencies as 300 in 5x5x5, each adjacency is between two small cubes, so each contributes two faces. So 300 adjacencies correspond to 600 small cube faces. But when I subtract the 3x3x3's 108, I get 492. So the shell has 492 glued small cube faces, plus 54 hollow faces, totaling 546.\n\nBut the initial approach says 588-150=438. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps the second approach is incorrect because when I subtract the 3x3x3's glued faces, I'm not accounting for the fact that the 3x3x3 is hollow and has no cubes. So perhaps the 3x3x3 doesn't contribute any glued faces, because it's empty.\n\nWait, no. The 3x3x3 is the hollow part. The small cubes in the shell are arranged around it. So the glued faces in the shell are between the shell's small cubes.\n\nWait, perhaps I shouldn't subtract the 3x3x3's glued faces because those are not present. Because the 3x3x3 is empty, the glued faces are only those between the shell's small cubes.\n\nWait, in the shell, the glued faces are only those between the 98 small cubes. So perhaps the correct way is to compute the number of glued face adjacencies in the shell.\n\nIn a 5x5x5 cube, the number of glued face adjacencies is 3*(5-1)*5^2 =3*4*25=300. So the number of glued small cube faces is 300 *2=600.\n\nBut the shell is the 5x5x5 minus the 3x3x3. So the 3x3x3's glued face adjacencies are not part of the shell. So the shell's glued face adjacencies are 300 minus the glued face adjacencies that are within the 3x3x3.\n\nBut wait, the 3x3x3's glued face adjacencies are 3*(3-1)*3^2 =3*2*9=54. So the number of glued face adjacencies in the shell is 300 - 54=246. So the number of glued small cube faces is 246*2=492.\n\nWait, but that's the same as before. So the shell's glued faces contribute 492, and the hollow contributes 54, totaling 546.\n\nBut this contradicts the initial approach.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach is wrong. Because when you have a hollow cube, the small cubes on the inside of the shell have their faces pointing into the hollow, which are unpainted. But those faces are part of the small cubes' total faces.\n\nWait, let's think about the total number of small cube faces:\n\nTotal small cubes:98.\n\nEach has 6 faces: 588.\n\nPainted faces:150.\n\nUnpainted:588-150=438.\n\nBut according to the second approach, the unpainted faces are 546, which is higher than 438.\n\nSo perhaps one of the approaches is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the second approach.\n\nWait, let's think about the 5x5x5 cube. It has 125 small cubes. Each has 6 faces, so 750. The number of glued face adjacencies is 300, so 600 glued small cube faces. The number of exterior faces is 6*25=150.\n\nSo total unpainted faces would be 750-150 (painted) -600 (glued) =0. Which can't be right. So that approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way to compute the number of glued faces is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of glued face adjacencies is the number of internal faces in the structure. For the 5x5x5 cube, the number of internal glued face adjacencies is 3*(5-1)*5^2=300. Each adjacency represents a single face between two cubes, so each adjacency contributes two faces (one from each cube). So the total number of glued small cube faces is 300*2=600.\n\nThe number of external faces (painted) is 150. So the total painted plus glued would be 150+600=750, which equals the total number of small cube faces (125*6=750). So that checks out.\n\nBut in the hollow cube, which is the 5x5x5 minus the 3x3x3, the small cubes are 98. So their total faces are 588.\n\nThe number of glued face adjacencies in the shell would be the total glued adjacencies in the 5x5x5 minus the glued adjacencies in the 3x3x3. But wait, the 3x3x3 is hollow, so it doesn't contribute any glued adjacencies because there are no cubes in the 3x3x3. So the glued adjacencies in the shell are the same as those in the 5x5x5, minus any that are within the 3x3x3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that the shell's glued adjacencies are the same as in the 5x5x5, but the 3x3x3's adjacencies are not part of the shell. So the number of glued adjacencies in the shell is 300 minus the 54 of the 3x3x3. So 300-54=246 adjacencies, which is 246*2=492 glued small cube faces.\n\nBut then the hollow contributes 54 unpainted faces, so total unpainted would be 492+54=546.\n\nBut according to the initial approach, it's 588-150=438. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second approach is incorrect because the 3x3x3 is hollow and thus doesn't contribute any glued faces, but the glued faces in the shell are just the same as in the 5x5x5 cube.\n\nWait, no. The 3x3x3 is hollow, so the shell's glued faces are only those between the shell's small cubes. So the number of glued face adjacencies in the shell is the same as the number in the 5x5x5 cube minus those in the 3x3x3 cube.\n\nWait, perhaps this is the key. So the shell's glued face adjacencies are 300 (from 5x5x5) minus 54 (from 3x3x3) =246.\n\nEach adjacency is a glued face, contributing two small cube faces. So 246*2=492.\n\nPlus the 54 faces of the hollow, totaling 546.\n\nBut according to the initial approach, 588-150=438, which is less than 546. So there's a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is correct because it's simply subtracting the painted faces from the total, but the second approach is overcounting.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake in the second approach is that the hollow's faces are already part of the small cube's faces that are not glued. So when I calculate the glued faces (492) and add the hollow's faces (54), I'm including all the unpainted faces, but perhaps the initial approach correctly accounts for all of them.\n\nWait, but according to the initial approach, the unpainted is 438, which is less than 546. That can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it this way: the total small cube faces in the shell are 588.\n\nThe painted ones are 150.\n\nThe remaining 438 are either glued or facing the hollow.\n\nSo, 438 = glued + hollow.\n\nBut according to the second approach, glued is 492 and hollow is 54, which sums to 546, which is larger than 438.\n\nSo that can't be right. So perhaps the second approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the error is in the way the glued face adjacencies are calculated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 438, as per the first approach, and the second approach is incorrect.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let me try a small example to see.\n\nLet's take a hollow cube of size 3x3x3 with thickness 1cm. So the hollow part is 1x1x1. The shell would consist of 3^3 -1^3=26 small cubes.\n\nEach small cube is 1x1x1.\n\nTotal small cube faces:26*6=156.\n\nPainted faces: each face of the big cube is 3x3=9, 6 faces: 54.\n\nUnpainted:156-54=102.\n\nNow, according to the second approach:\n\nGlued face adjacencies in the 3x3x3 cube:3*(3-1)*3^2=54. So glued small cube faces:54*2=108.\n\nHollow's faces:1x1x6=6.\n\nSo total unpainted would be 108+6=114.\n\nBut according to the first approach, it's 102. So the second approach gives a different answer, which must be wrong.\n\nSo the initial approach seems to be correct in this small example, because the actual unpainted faces should be 102.\n\nSo why is the second approach giving 114 in this case?\n\nHmm, perhaps because when the hollow is 1x1x1, the glued faces in the shell are not 54*2=108.\n\nWait, in the 3x3x3 cube, the shell is the entire cube except the 1x1x1 hollow.\n\nThe number of glued face adjacencies in the shell would be the same as in the 3x3x3 cube, which is 54 adjacencies, leading to 108 glued small cube faces.\n\nBut the actual total unpainted in the shell is 102, which is 156 (total) -54 (painted) =102.\n\nSo the second approach overcounts by 12 (114-102=12).\n\nAh, so the mistake must be that the hollow's faces are being added twice. Because when the hollow is subtracted, the glued face adjacencies are already accounted for.\n\nWait, perhaps the glued face adjacencies in the shell are 54, leading to 108 glued small cube faces. But the hollow's faces are 6, so total unpainted is 108+6=114, but the correct is 102. So the second approach is wrong.\n\nSo, the correct way must be the initial approach: total small cube faces - painted = unpainted.\n\nSo for the 3x3x3 hollow cube, it's 156-54=102 unpainted.\n\nThus, for the original problem, the correct answer is 588-150=438, which is option A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the hollow cube of size 5 cm (edge length) with a thickness of 1 cm. The cube is made up of smaller cubes of size 1 cm. The outer surface of the cube is painted, and we need to determine how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted.\n\n### Key Steps:\n\n1. **Total Number of Small Cubes in the Shell**:\n   - The cube has an outer shell of thickness 1 cm, and the hollow inner part has an edge length of \\(5 - 2 \\times 1 = 3 \\, \\text{cm}\\).\n   - Total small cubes in the 5 cm cube: \\(5^3 = 125\\).\n   - Total small cubes in the hollow inner part: \\(3^3 = 27\\).\n   - Total small cubes in the shell: \\(125 - 27 = 98\\).\n\n2. **Total Number of Faces of All Small Cubes**:\n   - Each small cube has 6 faces.\n   - Total faces of all small cubes: \\(98 \\times 6 = 588\\).\n\n3. **Number of Painted Faces**:\n   - The outer surface of the cube is painted. Each face of the cube is a \\(5 \\times 5\\) grid of small cubes, so there are \\(5^2 = 25\\) small faces per face of the cube.\n   - The cube has 6 faces, so the total number of painted faces: \\(6 \\times 25 = 150\\).\n\n4. **Number of Unpainted Faces**:\n   - The total number of unpainted faces is the total faces minus the painted faces: \\(588 - 150 = 438\\).\n\n### Verification:\nThe second approach attempted to calculate the number of glued faces and hollow faces separately but led to inconsistencies. The initial approach, which subtracts the painted faces from the total faces, is consistent and aligns with a smaller test case (e.g., a hollow cube of size 3 cm). Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: A**",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a hollow cube, and I'm trying to figure out how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted after the outer surface is painted. Let's see... Hmm, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the cube is hollow, right? And it's 5cm in size, but with a thickness of 1cm. So, wait, does that mean each edge of the cube is 5cm long? Oh, yes, because the size refers to the edge length. And each small cube is 1cm in size, so they're 1x1x1 cubes.\n\nSo the big cube is made up of smaller cubes. Since it's a hollow cube, I think only the outer layer is there, and the inside is empty. Wait, no. Wait, the thickness is 1cm, so the hollow part is 1cm thick. So the cube has an outer shell of 1cm thickness, and the inner part is empty. So the overall size is 5cm, but the hollow part is 5cm minus 2 times the thickness? No, wait. Let me think: the thickness is 1cm on each side, so the inner hollow cube would be 5 - 2*1 = 3cm on each edge. Because each side (left and right, top and bottom, front and back) has a 1cm thick layer. So the hollow part is 3x3x3 cubes, and the outer shell is the remaining.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the cube is hollow, made of smaller cubes. So the total number of small cubes is the total in the 5x5x5 cube minus the inner 3x3x3. So that would be 125 (5^3) minus 27 (3^3) which is 98 small cubes. But wait, the question is about the painted faces, not the number of small cubes. Hmm.\n\nWait, the question says, \"how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted?\" So each small cube has up to three faces exposed, but since the big cube is hollow, some might be on the inside.\n\nWait, no, because the big cube is hollow, the inner part is empty. So the small cubes are only on the surface. Wait, but the thickness is 1cm, so perhaps it's a cube that's 5cm on each edge, with the outer 1cm layer made up of small cubes, and the inside is empty. So the total number of small cubes is 5x5x5 minus 3x3x3, which is 125-27=98 cubes.\n\nBut wait, no, the question says it's made of smaller cubes of size 1cm, so perhaps the hollow cube is constructed as a shell, and the inside is empty. So each face of the big cube is a 5x5 grid of small cubes, but since the thickness is 1cm, each face's outer layer is 1cm, so the inner part is 3x3x3.\n\nWait, but no. The way the problem is phrased: it's a hollow cube of size 5cm, with thickness 1cm. So the cube is 5cm on each edge, but each face is a 5x5 grid of small cubes, each 1cm. So the cube is built with layers. The outermost layer is 1cm thick, so the inner part is 3cm on each edge, but since it's hollow, the inner part is empty.\n\nWait, perhaps I should visualize this. The big cube is 5x5x5, but the hollow part is a 3x3x3 cube inside, so the small cubes are only on the outer layer.\n\nSo each face of the big cube is a 5x5 grid of small cubes. Each small cube on the surface will have at least one face painted. But some will have two or three faces painted, like the edges and corners.\n\nBut the question is about the total number of faces that are unpainted. Wait, each small cube has 6 faces. Some of those faces are on the outside and get painted, others are either on the inside (but since the cube is hollow, those are not painted) or are glued to adjacent small cubes (so those faces are also not painted).\n\nWait, no, the outer surface is painted, so any face of a small cube that's on the exterior of the big cube will be painted. The other faces, either they are internal (between small cubes) or on the inside of the hollow part.\n\nWait, but since the cube is hollow, the inner surfaces of the hollow part are not painted. So for the small cubes on the outer layer, their inner faces (facing the hollow) are not painted. So for each small cube in the shell, any face that's pointing into the hollow is unpainted, but the other faces might be either painted or adjacent to another small cube (so not painted).\n\nSo the approach is to count all the faces of all the small cubes that are on the inside of the hollow part, and add those to the faces that are between small cubes (i.e., not on the exterior of the big cube).\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to calculate the total number of small cube faces and subtract the ones that are painted.\n\nEach small cube has 6 faces. There are 98 small cubes in the shell (as calculated before: 5^3 -3^3=125-27=98). So the total number of faces is 98 *6=588.\n\nNow, how many of these are painted? The painted faces are those on the exterior of the big cube. The big cube has 6 faces, each 5x5, so 25 small faces per face. So 6*25=150 small cube faces are painted.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Each face of the big cube is 5x5, so 25 small cube faces, and each of these is painted. So 6*25=150 painted small cube faces.\n\nSo the total painted is 150. So the unpainted faces would be total faces (588) minus painted (150) equals 438.\n\nWait, but wait. That would give 588-150=438, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because some of the small cube faces are on the inner side of the hollow cube. Those are not painted, right? So when I subtract only the painted ones, I'm leaving the inner faces and the glued faces as unpainted.\n\nWait, but in my initial approach, I assumed that the total faces are 588, of which 150 are painted, and the rest are unpainted. But that might not be correct because some of the small cube faces are internal (i.e., between two small cubes) and others are on the inner hollow side.\n\nWait, but when I count the total faces, each small cube has 6, but in the shell structure, some faces are glued to another cube (so they are internal), and others are on the outside (painted) or on the inner hollow (unpainted).\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: for each small cube in the shell, how many of its faces are unpainted.\n\nEach small cube can be in a corner, edge, face, or just somewhere in the shell.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to calculate the total number of unpainted faces.\n\nWait, the unpainted faces are those that are either inside the hollow (facing the empty space) or glued to another small cube (so not part of the exterior or the hollow).\n\nWait, but perhaps for each small cube, the number of unpainted faces is equal to the number of its faces that are not on the exterior. So for each small cube, the number of faces painted is the number of exterior faces it has. The unpainted ones are the others.\n\nSo for each small cube, the number of painted faces is 1, 2, or 3, depending on whether it's on a corner, edge, or face.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to calculate the total number of unpainted faces as the total number of faces minus the painted ones. Wait, but that's what I did earlier. Hmm.\n\nWait, earlier I calculated that total small cube faces are 588, and 150 are painted, so 438 unpainted. So the answer would be A)438.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The hollow cube has an inner part. The small cubes in the shell have some faces pointing into the hollow. Those are also unpainted. So the total unpainted faces would be the sum of all the inner faces of the shell and the glued faces.\n\nWait, but when I calculated 588-150=438, that includes both the internal glued faces and the inner hollow faces.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should double-check.\n\nEach small cube in the shell has 6 faces. The number of these that are on the exterior (and thus painted) is variable, but the sum of all the painted faces is 150 (since 6 faces of big cube, each with 25 small faces).\n\nSo the unpainted faces are 588-150=438. So the answer is A)438.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about it another way. The total number of small cube faces is 98 *6=588.\n\nThe painted ones are 6 faces of the big cube, each 5x5, so 6*25=150. So 150 painted.\n\nSo unpainted is 588-150=438.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. Another approach is to calculate how many small cube faces are on the inside of the hollow.\n\nThe hollow is a 3x3x3 cube. Each face of that hollow cube is 3x3=9 small cube faces. But since the hollow is inside the shell, each face of the hollow is surrounded by small cubes in the shell. So each face of the hollow has 9 small cube faces that are on the inside of the shell, and thus unpainted.\n\nThere are 6 faces on the hollow cube, so 6*9=54 small cube faces that are inside the hollow and unpainted.\n\nAdditionally, the small cubes in the shell have faces glued to each other. Each such glued face is shared between two small cubes, so each contributes two unpainted faces. But wait, no. When two small cubes are adjacent, their shared face is not painted, but each cube's face is part of their own count. So for each glued face, two faces (one from each cube) are unpainted.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the number of glued faces. The total number of glued faces is the number of adjacent small cubes in the shell.\n\nBut that might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to proceed with the first method.\n\nWait, in the first approach, the total unpainted is 438, which includes both the inner hollow faces and the glued faces.\n\nBut perhaps I can compute it another way to confirm.\n\nThe total unpainted faces would be the sum of the internal faces (the hollow) and the internal glued faces between small cubes.\n\nThe hollow contributes 6*(3^2) =54 unpainted faces.\n\nThe glued faces are the number of adjacent small cube faces within the shell. How many are there?\n\nThe shell is a cube of 5x5x5, but with a 3x3x3 hollow inside. So the number of small cubes in the shell is 98, as before.\n\nIn a cube, the number of adjacent face pairs can be calculated based on the structure.\n\nIn a cube of size N, the number of adjacent face pairs (i.e., shared between two cubes) is 3*(N-1)^2*(N). Wait, perhaps another approach.\n\nWait, for a cube, each face has (n-1)*(n-1) internal edges, leading to (n-1)^2 face adjacents per face. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the number of internal glued faces in the shell can be calculated as the number of glued faces in a 5x5x5 cube minus the glued faces in the 3x3x3 cube.\n\nWait, because the shell is the 5x5x5 minus the 3x3x3, so the glued faces in the shell would be the glued faces of the 5x5x5 cube minus those of the 3x3x3.\n\nWait, but in the 5x5x5 cube, the number of glued face pairs is 3*(5-1)*5*(5) for each dimension? Hmm, perhaps that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, another way: each glued face is shared between two small cubes, so the number of glued faces in a cube of size L x L x L is (L-1)*L^2 * 3. Because for each of the three dimensions, each layer has (L-1) connections per line.\n\nWait, in a cube of size L, the number of internal glued faces is 3*(L-1)*L^2. Because for each of the three dimensions (x, y, z), each layer has L^2 cubes, and (L-1) connections along each dimension.\n\nSo for a 5x5x5 cube, it's 3*(5-1)*5^2 = 3*4*25= 300.\n\nSimilarly, for a 3x3x3 cube, it's 3*(3-1)*3^2 =3*2*9=54.\n\nSo the number of glued faces in the shell would be 300 (from 5x5x5) minus 54 (from 3x3x3) = 246.\n\nBut wait, each glued face is counted once in this calculation, but each represents two faces (one from each cube) being glued. So the total number of glued small cube faces is 246*2=492? Wait, no, because each glued face is a shared face between two small cubes, so each such glued face contributes two unpainted faces (each cube's face). So the total number of glued unpainted faces is 246 * 2? No, because when you count the number of glued face adjacencies, each adjacency represents two faces, so the number of glued faces is 246, but each contributes two unpainted faces, so 246*2=492.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: when two small cubes are adjacent, their shared face is a single glued face. But each cube has a face in that glued position. So each glued face contributes two unpainted faces, one from each cube.\n\nSo the total number of glued unpainted faces is the number of glued face adjacencies multiplied by two.\n\nIn the 5x5x5 cube, the number of glued face adjacencies is 3*(5-1)*5^2 = 300. So the number of glued faces (each representing two unpainted faces) is 300, leading to 300*2=600. But wait, no, that can't be right because each glued face is counted once in the 300, but each contributes two faces.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of glued face adjacencies is 3*(5-1)*5^2 =3*4*25=300. Each adjacency represents a single glued face, which is two small cube faces. So the total number of glued small cube faces is 300*2=600.\n\nSimilarly, for the 3x3x3 cube, the number of glued face adjacencies is 3*(3-1)*3^2 =3*2*9=54, leading to 54*2=108 glued small cube faces.\n\nSo the glued faces in the shell (the 5x5x5 minus 3x3x3) would be 600 (from 5x5x5) minus 108 (from 3x3x3) = 492.\n\nSo the number of glued faces in the shell is 492.\n\nWait, but wait, this is the number of small cube faces that are glued to another cube and thus unpainted. So 492 is the number of glued unpainted faces.\n\nAdditionally, the hollow contributes 54 unpainted faces (each face of the hollow is 3x3, 6 faces, so 54).\n\nSo the total unpainted faces would be 492 (glued) +54 (hollow) =546.\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated 588-150=438. So now I'm getting a different number.\n\nHmm, so that's a problem. There's a contradiction here. Which approach is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in one of the approaches. Let me re-examine.\n\nIn the first approach, total small cube faces: 98 *6=588.\n\nPainted faces: 6*5*5=150.\n\nUnpainted: 588-150=438.\n\nIn the second approach, I calculated glued faces as 492 and hollow faces as 54, totaling 546. But 546 is larger than 438, which can't be right because 546 is more than the total unpainted faces.\n\nSo where's the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm double-counting. Let me think again.\n\nWait, when I compute the glued faces in the shell as 492, that's the number of small cube faces that are glued to another cube. But each glued face is counted once for each cube. So, for example, if cube A is glued to cube B, then cube A has one face glued, and cube B has one face glued. So in the 5x5x5 cube, the number of glued face adjacencies is 300 (as before), and each represents two small cube faces. So the number of glued small cube faces is 300*2=600.\n\nSimilarly, for the 3x3x3, it's 54*2=108.\n\nSo in the shell, the glued small cube faces would be 600 (from 5x5x5) minus 108 (from 3x3x3) =492.\n\nBut each of these 492 is a face that is glued to another cube, so they are unpainted.\n\nAdditionally, the hollow's faces: each face of the hollow is 3x3, so 6*9=54. These are the small cube faces that are pointing into the hollow and are thus unpainted.\n\nSo the total unpainted faces would be 492 (glued) +54 (hollow) =546.\n\nBut earlier, I have 588-150=438. So why the discrepancy?\n\nAh, perhaps the problem is that when I subtract the painted faces from the total, I'm not considering that the hollow faces are part of the small cube's faces that are not painted, but in the initial approach, they are included in the 588 total.\n\nWait, the initial approach:\n\nTotal small cube faces: 98 *6 =588.\n\nPainted:150.\n\nUnpainted:588-150=438.\n\nBut according to the second approach, the unpainted is 546. So which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the second approach is overcounting. Let me think about it again.\n\nEach small cube in the shell has some faces:\n\n- Some are on the exterior and thus painted (1, 2, or 3 faces).\n\n- Some are glued to another cube (so not painted).\n\n- Some are on the inner side of the shell (facing the hollow), so not painted.\n\nSo for each small cube, the number of unpainted faces is:\n\n6 (total) - number of exterior faces (painted) - number of glued faces (interior to the shell).\n\nWait, but no, because the glued faces are also part of the shell's interior. So perhaps each small cube in the shell has some faces that are exterior (painted), some glued to another cube (unpainted), and some glued to the hollow (unpainted).\n\nWait, but the hollow is empty. So the faces of the small cubes that are on the inside of the shell are not glued to anything; they're just facing the hollow. So those are unpainted.\n\nSo for each small cube in the shell:\n\npainted_faces = number of exterior faces (could be 1, 2, or 3)\n\nunpainted_faces = 6 - painted_faces.\n\nBut the unpainted_faces include both the glued faces to other cubes and the faces pointing into the hollow.\n\nWait, but in reality, the small cube in the shell can be on the corner, edge, or face.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: For each small cube, determine how many of its faces are unpainted.\n\nBut that might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach is correct, and the second approach has a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the second approach double-counts some faces. Let me think: when I calculate the glued face adjacencies as 300 in 5x5x5, each adjacency is between two small cubes, so each contributes two faces. So 300 adjacencies correspond to 600 small cube faces. But when I subtract the 3x3x3's 108, I get 492. So the shell has 492 glued small cube faces, plus 54 hollow faces, totaling 546.\n\nBut the initial approach says 588-150=438. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps the second approach is incorrect because when I subtract the 3x3x3's glued faces, I'm not accounting for the fact that the 3x3x3 is hollow and has no cubes. So perhaps the 3x3x3 doesn't contribute any glued faces, because it's empty.\n\nWait, no. The 3x3x3 is the hollow part. The small cubes in the shell are arranged around it. So the glued faces in the shell are between the shell's small cubes.\n\nWait, perhaps I shouldn't subtract the 3x3x3's glued faces because those are not present. Because the 3x3x3 is empty, the glued faces are only those between the shell's small cubes.\n\nWait, in the shell, the glued faces are only those between the 98 small cubes. So perhaps the correct way is to compute the number of glued face adjacencies in the shell.\n\nIn a 5x5x5 cube, the number of glued face adjacencies is 3*(5-1)*5^2 =3*4*25=300. So the number of glued small cube faces is 300 *2=600.\n\nBut the shell is the 5x5x5 minus the 3x3x3. So the 3x3x3's glued face adjacencies are not part of the shell. So the shell's glued face adjacencies are 300 minus the glued face adjacencies that are within the 3x3x3.\n\nBut wait, the 3x3x3's glued face adjacencies are 3*(3-1)*3^2 =3*2*9=54. So the number of glued face adjacencies in the shell is 300 - 54=246. So the number of glued small cube faces is 246*2=492.\n\nWait, but that's the same as before. So the shell's glued faces contribute 492, and the hollow contributes 54, totaling 546.\n\nBut this contradicts the initial approach.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach is wrong. Because when you have a hollow cube, the small cubes on the inside of the shell have their faces pointing into the hollow, which are unpainted. But those faces are part of the small cubes' total faces.\n\nWait, let's think about the total number of small cube faces:\n\nTotal small cubes:98.\n\nEach has 6 faces: 588.\n\nPainted faces:150.\n\nUnpainted:588-150=438.\n\nBut according to the second approach, the unpainted faces are 546, which is higher than 438.\n\nSo perhaps one of the approaches is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the second approach.\n\nWait, let's think about the 5x5x5 cube. It has 125 small cubes. Each has 6 faces, so 750. The number of glued face adjacencies is 300, so 600 glued small cube faces. The number of exterior faces is 6*25=150.\n\nSo total unpainted faces would be 750-150 (painted) -600 (glued) =0. Which can't be right. So that approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way to compute the number of glued faces is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of glued face adjacencies is the number of internal faces in the structure. For the 5x5x5 cube, the number of internal glued face adjacencies is 3*(5-1)*5^2=300. Each adjacency represents a single face between two cubes, so each adjacency contributes two faces (one from each cube). So the total number of glued small cube faces is 300*2=600.\n\nThe number of external faces (painted) is 150. So the total painted plus glued would be 150+600=750, which equals the total number of small cube faces (125*6=750). So that checks out.\n\nBut in the hollow cube, which is the 5x5x5 minus the 3x3x3, the small cubes are 98. So their total faces are 588.\n\nThe number of glued face adjacencies in the shell would be the total glued adjacencies in the 5x5x5 minus the glued adjacencies in the 3x3x3. But wait, the 3x3x3 is hollow, so it doesn't contribute any glued adjacencies because there are no cubes in the 3x3x3. So the glued adjacencies in the shell are the same as those in the 5x5x5, minus any that are within the 3x3x3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that the shell's glued adjacencies are the same as in the 5x5x5, but the 3x3x3's adjacencies are not part of the shell. So the number of glued adjacencies in the shell is 300 minus the 54 of the 3x3x3. So 300-54=246 adjacencies, which is 246*2=492 glued small cube faces.\n\nBut then the hollow contributes 54 unpainted faces, so total unpainted would be 492+54=546.\n\nBut according to the initial approach, it's 588-150=438. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second approach is incorrect because the 3x3x3 is hollow and thus doesn't contribute any glued faces, but the glued faces in the shell are just the same as in the 5x5x5 cube.\n\nWait, no. The 3x3x3 is hollow, so the shell's glued faces are only those between the shell's small cubes. So the number of glued face adjacencies in the shell is the same as the number in the 5x5x5 cube minus those in the 3x3x3 cube.\n\nWait, perhaps this is the key. So the shell's glued face adjacencies are 300 (from 5x5x5) minus 54 (from 3x3x3) =246.\n\nEach adjacency is a glued face, contributing two small cube faces. So 246*2=492.\n\nPlus the 54 faces of the hollow, totaling 546.\n\nBut according to the initial approach, 588-150=438, which is less than 546. So there's a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is correct because it's simply subtracting the painted faces from the total, but the second approach is overcounting.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake in the second approach is that the hollow's faces are already part of the small cube's faces that are not glued. So when I calculate the glued faces (492) and add the hollow's faces (54), I'm including all the unpainted faces, but perhaps the initial approach correctly accounts for all of them.\n\nWait, but according to the initial approach, the unpainted is 438, which is less than 546. That can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it this way: the total small cube faces in the shell are 588.\n\nThe painted ones are 150.\n\nThe remaining 438 are either glued or facing the hollow.\n\nSo, 438 = glued + hollow.\n\nBut according to the second approach, glued is 492 and hollow is 54, which sums to 546, which is larger than 438.\n\nSo that can't be right. So perhaps the second approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the error is in the way the glued face adjacencies are calculated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 438, as per the first approach, and the second approach is incorrect.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let me try a small example to see.\n\nLet's take a hollow cube of size 3x3x3 with thickness 1cm. So the hollow part is 1x1x1. The shell would consist of 3^3 -1^3=26 small cubes.\n\nEach small cube is 1x1x1.\n\nTotal small cube faces:26*6=156.\n\nPainted faces: each face of the big cube is 3x3=9, 6 faces: 54.\n\nUnpainted:156-54=102.\n\nNow, according to the second approach:\n\nGlued face adjacencies in the 3x3x3 cube:3*(3-1)*3^2=54. So glued small cube faces:54*2=108.\n\nHollow's faces:1x1x6=6.\n\nSo total unpainted would be 108+6=114.\n\nBut according to the first approach, it's 102. So the second approach gives a different answer, which must be wrong.\n\nSo the initial approach seems to be correct in this small example, because the actual unpainted faces should be 102.\n\nSo why is the second approach giving 114 in this case?\n\nHmm, perhaps because when the hollow is 1x1x1, the glued faces in the shell are not 54*2=108.\n\nWait, in the 3x3x3 cube, the shell is the entire cube except the 1x1x1 hollow.\n\nThe number of glued face adjacencies in the shell would be the same as in the 3x3x3 cube, which is 54 adjacencies, leading to 108 glued small cube faces.\n\nBut the actual total unpainted in the shell is 102, which is 156 (total) -54 (painted) =102.\n\nSo the second approach overcounts by 12 (114-102=12).\n\nAh, so the mistake must be that the hollow's faces are being added twice. Because when the hollow is subtracted, the glued face adjacencies are already accounted for.\n\nWait, perhaps the glued face adjacencies in the shell are 54, leading to 108 glued small cube faces. But the hollow's faces are 6, so total unpainted is 108+6=114, but the correct is 102. So the second approach is wrong.\n\nSo, the correct way must be the initial approach: total small cube faces - painted = unpainted.\n\nSo for the 3x3x3 hollow cube, it's 156-54=102 unpainted.\n\nThus, for the original problem, the correct answer is 588-150=438, which is option A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the hollow cube of size 5 cm (edge length) with a thickness of 1 cm. The cube is made up of smaller cubes of size 1 cm. The outer surface of the cube is painted, and we need to determine how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted.\n\n### Key Steps:\n\n1. **Total Number of Small Cubes in the Shell**:\n   - The cube has an outer shell of thickness 1 cm, and the hollow inner part has an edge length of \\(5 - 2 \\times 1 = 3 \\, \\text{cm}\\).\n   - Total small cubes in the 5 cm cube: \\(5^3 = 125\\).\n   - Total small cubes in the hollow inner part: \\(3^3 = 27\\).\n   - Total small cubes in the shell: \\(125 - 27 = 98\\).\n\n2. **Total Number of Faces of All Small Cubes**:\n   - Each small cube has 6 faces.\n   - Total faces of all small cubes: \\(98 \\times 6 = 588\\).\n\n3. **Number of Painted Faces**:\n   - The outer surface of the cube is painted. Each face of the cube is a \\(5 \\times 5\\) grid of small cubes, so there are \\(5^2 = 25\\) small faces per face of the cube.\n   - The cube has 6 faces, so the total number of painted faces: \\(6 \\times 25 = 150\\).\n\n4. **Number of Unpainted Faces**:\n   - The total number of unpainted faces is the total faces minus the painted faces: \\(588 - 150 = 438\\).\n\n### Verification:\nThe second approach attempted to calculate the number of glued faces and hollow faces separately but led to inconsistencies. The initial approach, which subtracts the painted faces from the total faces, is consistent and aligns with a smaller test case (e.g., a hollow cube of size 3 cm). Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: A**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hollow cube, and I'm trying to figure out how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, the cube is hollow and has a size of 5 cm, with each face being 5x5 cm. The thickness is 1 cm, which I think means that the walls of the cube are 1 cm thick. So it's like a box where the inside is empty. It's made up of smaller cubes, each 1 cm in size. So each small cube is 1x1x1 cm.\n\nThe question is about painting the outer surface. So when they paint the outer surfaces, only the cubes on the outside will have their outer faces painted. The inner cubes, which are not on the surface, won't be painted. But we need to find how many faces of all the small cubes remain unpainted. Wait, so each small cube can have multiple faces\u2014like if it's on a corner, it has three faces exposed, but if it's on an edge but not a corner, maybe two, and so on.\n\nWait, but the question is about the total number of faces that are unpainted across all the small cubes. So I think I need to calculate all the faces of all small cubes and then subtract the ones that are painted.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many small cubes there are in total. Since the big cube is 5 cm on each side, but it's hollow with a thickness of 1 cm. So the hollow part would be a smaller cube inside. The outer layer is 1 cm thick, so the inner hollow part would be 5 - 2*1 = 3 cm on each side. So the inner cube is 3x3x3, which is 27 small cubes. Wait, but the entire structure is made up of 5x5x5 = 125 small cubes. So the hollow part is 3x3x3, which is 27. So the total number of small cubes in the hollow cube is 125 - 27 = 98. Wait, wait, no, that can't be right because the hollow cube's structure is that only the outer layer is present. So the total number of small cubes in the hollow cube would be the surface cubes minus the inner cubes. Hmm, maybe another way: the hollow cube is a 5x5x5 cube with the inner 3x3x3 removed. So total small cubes are 125 - 27 = 98. So 98 small cubes in the hollow structure.\n\nBut wait, each small cube can have multiple painted faces. So perhaps a better approach is to think about how many faces are painted on the entire structure, and then subtract that from the total number of faces possible.\n\nEach small cube has 6 faces. So for 98 small cubes, total faces would be 98 * 6 = 588. But wait, that can't be right because each face is shared between two cubes if they're adjacent, but in this case, since we're considering the entire structure, maybe that's not the way to go. Hmm, perhaps I should instead compute the total number of small cube faces in the big cube and then subtract the ones that are painted.\n\nWait, the big cube is 5x5x5, so each face of the big cube is 5x5=25 small cube faces. There are 6 faces, so 6*25 = 150 small cube faces painted on the outside. So the painted faces are 150.\n\nBut wait, each small cube on the corner or edge may have multiple painted faces. But when we count the painted faces on the big cube's surface, each face of the big cube's surface is 25 small cube faces, so all of those are painted. So the total painted small cube faces are 150.\n\nSo the total number of small cube faces is 5x5x5 cubes, each with 6 faces: 125 *6 =750. So the total possible small cube faces are 750. But wait, no, because the hollow part is empty. Wait, the hollow cube is made of 98 small cubes, each with 6 faces. So 98 *6=588. But some of their faces are on the inside, touching each other, but those aren't painted. Only the outer surfaces are painted.\n\nWait, but in the hollow cube, the inner surfaces (the walls) are not painted because they're inside. So the only painted faces are the ones on the outside. So the total painted faces are the same as the outer surface of the big cube, which is 6*(5x5)=150.\n\nSo the unpainted faces would be the total faces of all small cubes minus the painted ones. So 98*6 =588. Subtract 150, which gives 438. But wait, wait a second, that can't be right because the problem is about a hollow cube. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of small cubes.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the number of small cubes. The hollow cube is 5x5x5 on the outside. The inner hollow part is 3x3x3, because each side is 5-2*1=3 cm. So the total number of small cubes in the hollow cube is 5^3 - 3^3 = 125 -27=98. So 98 small cubes. Each has 6 faces, so 98*6=588.\n\nThe outer surfaces of the big cube are 6 faces, each 5x5, so 150 small cube faces. So the number of painted faces is 150. Therefore, the unpainted faces would be 588-150=438. So the answer is 438, which is option A.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Are there any internal faces that are also unpainted? Because the hollow cube's inner surfaces are not painted, but the small cubes inside the hollow have their inner faces unpainted as well. But when we subtract the outer painted faces, the rest are the internal faces. So maybe I should think of it as the total faces of all small cubes (588) minus the painted ones (150) gives the unpainted, which includes both the inner faces and the faces of the hollow interior.\n\nWait, but in a hollow cube, each small cube on the exterior has some painted faces, but the internal small cubes (the inner 3x3x3) are not present, so their faces wouldn't contribute. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about the number of small cube faces that are not on the exterior. The exterior has 150 painted faces, but the small cubes in the hollow have their own faces that are not painted. So the total unpainted is 588-150=438.\n\nBut looking at the options, option A is 438, which matches. So the answer should be A.\n",
