      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Sachin's batting average in the IPL. Hmm, I need to find out how many matches he's played this season. Let's see, I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nSo, the problem says that Sachin's current batting average is 51. Then, in the finals, he scores 78 runs, and his average goes up to 54. I need to find the total number of matches he's played.\n\nWait, I remember batting average is calculated by dividing the total runs by the number of innings, right? Or is it matches? Oh wait, in cricket, a match can have multiple innings if both teams bat once each. But in this context, I think it refers to the number of innings he's batted, which is the same as the number of matches he's played if he's the opening batsman and batted in each game. So I'll assume that the number of matches is equal to the number of innings he's had.\n\nSo let's let the number of matches he's played before the finals be 'n'. His average before the finals is 51, so his total runs before would be 51 multiplied by n. Then, in the finals, he scores 78 runs. So his new total runs become 51n + 78. The number of innings (and thus matches) is now n + 1.\n\nHis new average is 54, so (51n + 78)/(n + 1) = 54. Now I can set up this equation and solve for n.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n(51n + 78) / (n + 1) = 54.\n\nMultiply both sides by (n + 1) to get rid of the denominator:\n\n51n + 78 = 54(n + 1).\n\nExpanding the right side: 54n + 54.\n\nSo now:\n\n51n + 78 = 54n + 54.\n\nLet me bring like terms together. Subtract 51n from both sides:\n\n78 = 3n + 54.\n\nSubtract 54 from both sides:\n\n24 = 3n.\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\nn = 8.\n\nWait, so n is 8. That means before the finals, he played 8 matches. But the finals was the 9th match, right? So the total number of matches he's played is 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nWait, looking at the options, option C is 9. So that must be the answer.\n\nBut let me double-check my math to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSo, initial average 51 in n=8 matches: 51 *8=408 runs.\n\nAfter finals, runs are 408+78=486. Number of innings is 9. 486 /9 =54. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the total matches are 9, so the answer is C.\n",

I need to find out how many matches he played in total this season.\n\nWait, batting average is calculated as total runs divided by the number of innings, right? Because each innings is a dismissal, so the average is total runs divided by the number of times he's been dismissed. So, if he's played a certain number of matches, he would have batted that many times (assuming he batted in each match). Wait, but sometimes players don't bat in every match, but maybe in this context, we can assume that each match contributes to one innings. Hmm, but the problem might not complicate things like that. So perhaps the number of matches is the same as the number of innings he's had.\n\nLet me set up some variables. Let's say the number of matches he played before the finals is 'n'. His batting average before the finals is 51, so the total runs he had before would be 51 multiplied by n, right? Because average = total runs / number of innings. So total runs R = 51n.\n\nThen, in the finals, he scores 78 runs. So his new total runs would be R + 78 = 51n +78. And the number of innings now is n +1, because he played one more match (the finals) and batted in it.\n\nHis new average is 54. So according to the formula, 54 = (51n +78)/(n +1). \n\nOkay, now I can set up the equation: 54 = (51n +78)/(n +1). Let's solve for n.\n\nMultiply both sides by (n +1):\n\n54(n +1) = 51n +78\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n54n +54 =51n +78\n\nSubtract 51n from both sides:\n\n3n +54 =78\n\nSubtract 54 from both sides:\n\n3n =24\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\nn=8.\n\nSo, before the finals, he played 8 matches.

Let me check the options.\n\nThe options are A)6, B)8, C)9, D)10, E)11. So option C is 9. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations to be sure. \n\nn=8 before the finals. So total runs before finals: 51 *8=408. After finals, runs are 408+78=486. Number of innings is 9. 486/9=54, which matches the new average. Yep, that's correct. So the total matches are 9.\n",
