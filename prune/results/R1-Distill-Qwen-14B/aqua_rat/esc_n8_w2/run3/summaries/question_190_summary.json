      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a cereal mixture. Let me read it again. The mixture has rice, wheat, and corn in the ratio 2:3:5. A bag contains 3 pounds of rice, and I need to find out how much corn it has. Hmm, ratios can sometimes trip me up, but I think I can handle this.\n\nAlright, so ratios are about comparing quantities. The ratio 2:3:5 means for every 2 parts of rice, there are 3 parts wheat and 5 parts corn. So first, maybe I should figure out what one part equals in pounds. Because if I can find that, I can calculate all the quantities.\n\nThe bag has 3 pounds of rice, and rice is 2 parts. So 2 parts equal 3 pounds. Let me write that down. Let's say one part is equal to x pounds. So 2x = 3 pounds. To find x, I divide both sides by 2. So x = 3/2, which is 1.5 pounds per part.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that. If 2 parts = 3 pounds, then each part is 3 divided by 2, which is 1.5. Yeah, that's right. So one part is 1.5 pounds.\n\nNow, the corn is 5 parts. So 5 parts would be 5 times 1.5. Let me calculate that. 5 * 1.5 is 7.5. So that's 7.5 pounds of corn in the bag.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 7.5. So that should be the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the ratios. The ratio is rice:wheat:corn as 2:3:5. So rice is 2, wheat 3, corn 5. So the total parts are 2+3+5 = 10 parts in the mixture. But wait, maybe I don't need the total? Because I was given the rice, which is part of the ratio, so using the per part approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of fractions. The fraction of the mixture that's rice is 2/10, which is 1/5. So if 1/5 of the mixture is 3 pounds, then the total mixture is 3 *5 =15 pounds. Then, the corn is 5/10, which is 1/2 of the mixture. Half of 15 is 7.5. Yep, same answer.\n\nWait, but the question is only asking about corn, so that method works too. Either way, I get 7.5 pounds. So the correct option is B)7.5.\n",

Alright, so ratios can sometimes trip me up, but I think I can handle it. Let me think step by step.\n\nSo the ratio is 2:3:5 for rice:wheat:corn.
