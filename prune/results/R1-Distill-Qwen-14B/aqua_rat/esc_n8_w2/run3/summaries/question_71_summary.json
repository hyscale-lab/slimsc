      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a shopkeeper who gave a 20% discount and now needs to bring the prices back to the original. I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nHmm, let me start by visualizing the situation. Let's say the original price of an item is $100. Why 100? Because percentages are easier to calculate with 100, right? So, if the original price is $100 and there's a 20% discount, the discounted price becomes 80% of the original.\n\nWait, 20% off on $100 means the customer pays 80% of 100. So that's 0.8 * 100 = $80. Got it. So the price went down to $80.\n\nNow, the shopkeeper wants to sell it again at the original price, which is $100. But the question is, what percentage increase from the discounted price ($80) will bring it back to $100?\n\nOh right, so I need to find the percentage increase from $80 to $100. How do I calculate that again? I remember the formula for percentage increase is ((New Value - Original Value)/Original Value) * 100%.\n\nSo in this case, the original value is $80, and the new value is $100. Plugging those in: (100 - 80)/80 * 100% = (20/80)*100%. Let me compute that. 20 divided by 80 is 0.25. Multiply by 100% gives 25%.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the shopkeeper needs to increase the price by 25% from the discounted price to get back to the original. Let me double-check with another example to make sure I'm not making a mistake.\n\nSuppose the original price was $200. 20% off would make it $160. To get back to $200, the increase needed is (200-160)/160 *100% = 40/160 *100% = 25%. Yep, same result. So the percentage increase needed is 25%.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 25%, so that's the correct answer.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the percentage increase needed to bring the price back to its original value after a 20% discount, let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. **Original Price**: Assume the original price of an item is $100 (using $100 for simplicity since percentages are easier to calculate with this value).\n\n2. **Discounted Price**: A 20% discount reduces the price to 80% of the original.  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Discounted Price} = 100 - (0.20 \\times 100) = 80 \\, \\text{dollars}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Percentage Increase Needed**: To return the price to the original $100 from the discounted price of $80, the percentage increase can be calculated using the formula:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{New Value} - \\text{Original Value}}{\\text{Original Value}}\\right) \\times 100\\%.\n   \\]  \n   Substituting the values:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left(\\frac{100 - 80}{80}\\right) \\times 100\\% = \\left(\\frac{20}{80}\\right) \\times 100\\% = 25\\%.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verification**: To confirm, consider another example where the original price is $200. A 20% discount brings the price to $160. To return to $200, the percentage increase is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left(\\frac{200 - 160}{160}\\right) \\times 100\\% = \\left(\\frac{40}{160}\\right) \\times 100\\% = 25\\%.\n   \\]  \n   This consistent result confirms that the required percentage increase is indeed 25%.\n\nThus, the shopkeeper must increase the price by **25%** to return it to the original value.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem about the shopkeeper and the discounts. Hmm, let's see. The question says that the shopkeeper gave a 20% discount on all items for one day. Then the next day, he needs to sell them at the original price again. But wait, the question is asking by what percentage he must increase the discounted price to get back to the original price. Oh right, because after a discount, the price is lower, so to get back to the original, you have to increase it by some percentage.\n\nWait, I think I remember something about percentage increases and decreases. Like, if you have a certain percentage decrease, the percentage increase needed to get back isn't the same as the decrease. Because the base changes. Oh yeah, that's right. For example, if something goes down by 50%, you need a 100% increase to get back to where you started. Because 50% of the original is the new base, so doubling that gets you back.\n\nSo applying that to this problem. Let me think. The original price is let's say, 100 units. Then a 20% discount would make the price 80 units. Because 20% of 100 is 20, subtract that and you get 80. Now, the next day, he wants to go back to 100 from 80. So what percentage increase from 80 gives 100?\n\nLet me calculate that. The increase needed is 100 - 80 = 20. So 20 is what percentage of 80? To find the percentage increase, you divide the increase by the original amount (which is now 80) and then multiply by 100. So 20 / 80 = 0.25. Multiply by 100, that's 25%. So the answer should be 25%, which is option C.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me think of it another way. Let me take a different number, like 200 as the original price. 20% discount would be 40 off, so 160. To get back to 200, the increase needed is 40. So 40 is what percent of 160? 40/160 = 0.25, so 25% again. Yep, same result. So I'm confident the answer is C)25%.\n",
