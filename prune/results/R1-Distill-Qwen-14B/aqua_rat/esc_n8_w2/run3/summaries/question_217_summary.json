      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this probability problem here. Let me read it again. It says there are five horses in a race. Mr. Jain selects two of them at random and bets on them. The question is asking for the probability that he selected the winning horse. The options are A to E, with B being 2/5, which I think might be the answer, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nWait, let me break it down. So, the setup is a race with five horses. I'm assuming that each horse has an equal chance of winning, right? Because the problem doesn't specify any other conditions, like some horses being faster or anything. So each horse has a 1/5 chance of winning.\n\nBut wait, Mr. Jain is betting on two horses. So he's picking two, and he wants to know the probability that at least one of them is the winner. Hmm, or wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Does he bet on both, and if either wins, he wins? Or does he need both to win? The question says he bets on them, but it's a bit ambiguous. But I think the standard way is that if either of the two horses he picks wins, he wins the bet. So the question is, what's the probability that at least one of the two he picks is the winning horse.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the winning horse is just one, and the question is about whether he selected that particular horse. Because he's selecting two, the probability that the winning horse is among his two choices. Oh wait, that makes sense. Because each horse race usually has one winner. So the question is, given that Mr. Jain picks two horses at random, what is the probability that the winning horse is one of them.\n\nAh, okay, that makes more sense. So the problem is similar to probability questions where you pick a subset and want to know if a specific element is included.\n\nSo, to calculate this, let's think about the total number of possible ways he can choose two horses out of five. The number of combinations is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k! (n - k)!). So for n=5 and k=2, that's 5!/(2!3!) = (5\u00d74)/(2\u00d71) = 10. So there are 10 possible pairs.\n\nNow, how many of these pairs include the winning horse? Well, the winning horse is one specific horse. So how many pairs include that one horse? Well, if one horse is fixed as the winner, then the other horse in the pair can be any of the remaining four. So that's 4 possible pairs that include the winning horse.\n\nSo the number of favorable outcomes is 4, and the total possible is 10. So the probability is 4/10, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nWait, but another way to think about this is to compute the probability that he picks the winning horse. Since he's selecting two, the chance that the winning horse is among them. Alternatively, the probability that he selects the winning horse is equal to the number of ways he can include it divided by the total ways.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of it as each horse has an equal chance. The probability that he selects the winning horse is the same as the number of horses he picks divided by the total number of horses. Since he picks two, the probability is 2/5. Because each horse has a 1/5 chance, and he's picking two, so 2*(1/5) = 2/5. Hmm, that seems to match the earlier result.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Another approach: the probability that the winning horse is not selected by Mr. Jain. Since he picks two, the number of horses not selected is three. So the probability that the winning horse is not in his two is 3/5. Therefore, the probability that it is selected is 1 - 3/5 = 2/5. That also gives the same answer.\n\nSo, all methods point to the probability being 2/5. Looking back at the options, option B is 2/5. So that should be the correct answer.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the probability that Mr. Jain selects the winning horse when he bets on two horses out of five, we analyze the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Total number of possible pairs**: The number of ways to choose two horses out of five is given by the combination formula:  \n   \\[\n   \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10\n   \\]\n\n2. **Number of favorable outcomes**: The winning horse is one specific horse.

So, first, let me think about how many possible ways there are for Mr. Jain to choose two horses out of five. Since he's selecting two, this sounds like a combination problem because the order doesn't matter here. The number of ways to choose 2 horses from 5 is calculated using combinations, right? The formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n!/(k!(n-k)!)). So, plugging in n=5 and k=2, that's 5!/(2!3!) which equals (5\u00d74\u00d73!)/(2\u00d71\u00d73!) = (20)/2 = 10. So there are 10 possible pairs he could choose.\n\nNow, the probability of him selecting the winning horse. Wait, but the question is about the probability that he selected the winning horse. I think I need to clarify: is the winning horse only one? I assume so because in a race, usually, there's one winner. So, the winning horse is a single horse among the five.\n\nSo, the question is, what's the chance that one of the two horses Mr. Jain picked is the winning one. So, the favorable outcomes are the number of pairs that include the winning horse. How many such pairs are there?\n\nWell, if there's one winning horse, then the other horse in the pair can be any of the remaining four. So, the number of favorable pairs is 4. Because for each winning horse, he could pair it with any of the other four. So, 4 favorable pairs out of 10 total possible.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. So, the probability is 4/10, which simplifies to 2/5. So, looking at the options, option B is 2/5. That should be the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me think again to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Another approach: the probability that the first horse he picks is the winner is 1/5. Then, the probability that the second horse he picks is the winner, given that the first wasn't. So, the first pick not being a winner is 4/5, and then the second pick being the winner is 1/4 (since one horse is already picked and not the winner). So, the probability of winning on the second pick is (4/5) * (1/4) = 1/5. Adding both possibilities, 1/5 + 1/5 = 2/5. Yep, that's the same as before.
