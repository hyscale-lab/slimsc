      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to add +45 and -30. Hmm, let me think about how to do this. I remember that when you add a positive and a negative number, it's like subtracting. So maybe I should subtract the smaller number from the larger one, but wait, which way around? \n\nWait, I think it's the absolute values. Oh right, because adding a positive and a negative is the same as subtracting their magnitudes. So, 45 is positive, 30 is the magnitude of the negative. So 45 minus 30 equals 15. But wait, do I take the sign from the larger number? Oh yeah, because 45 is bigger than 30, the result should be positive. So the answer should be +15.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 15. So I think D is the correct answer.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question here: add +45 and -30. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my math, but I'll try to think it through. Alright, let's see. Adding positive and negative numbers... right, that's like subtracting when one is negative. So, when you have a positive and a negative number, you subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger one and take the sign of the larger.\n\nWait, wait. Let me get this straight. So, +45 is a positive number, and -30 is negative. When adding them, it's like 45 plus (-30), which is the same as 45 minus 30. Oh, right! Because adding a negative is subtracting. So, 45 minus 30 is... 15? Yeah, that makes sense. So the sum should be +15.\n\nNow, looking at the options, D is +15. So that must be the correct answer. But wait, let me double-check. Sometimes I get confused with the signs. So 45 plus (-30) is 15, right? Because 45 is bigger than 30, and since 45 is positive, the result is positive.\n\nAnother way to think about it: imagine you have 45 apples and you owe someone 30 apples. After paying back, you're left with 15 apples. Yeah, that makes sense. So the answer is definitely D.\n",
