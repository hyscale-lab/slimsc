      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about chocolates in a store. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored. So, no other options. Got it. \n\nThe problem says 10% are cocoa flavored. Oh, wait, that must mean that the rest, which is 90%, are vanilla because vanilla and cocoa are the only options. So if I have a total of, say, 100 chocolates for simplicity, 10 would be cocoa, and 90 would be vanilla. \n\nBut wait, the next part says 90% of the rest are squashed. Hmm. Oh wait, the \"rest\" must be referring to the vanilla ones, right? Because the 10% were cocoa. So the rest after 10% cocoa would be 90%, which is the vanilla. So 90% of that 90% are squashed. \n\nLet me break that down. So, if there are 90 vanilla chocolates, 90% of those are squashed. So 90 * 0.9 equals 81. So 81 are squashed vanilla. But wait, the question is asking for the percentage that are both vanilla and not squashed. Oh right, so the ones that are vanilla but not squashed would be the remaining 10% of the vanilla chocolates. \n\nWait, no. Because 90% are squashed, so the remaining 10% are not squashed. So 10% of 90 is 9. Because 90 * 0.1 equals 9. So 9 chocolates are vanilla and not squashed. \n\nBut wait, the total number of chocolates is 100, so 9 out of 100 is 9%. Oh, so the answer should be 9%, which is option D. \n\nWait, let me double-check. The initial 10% are cocoa, so 10 out of 100. The rest, 90, are vanilla. 90% of those vanilla are squashed, so 81 are squashed vanilla. That leaves 9 vanilla not squashed. So 9 out of 100, which is 9%, so D is the correct option. \n\nI think that's right. The answer should be D)9%.\n",
