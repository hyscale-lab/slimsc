      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about two printers, Printer A and Printer B. Both of them can print half a page per second. The question is asking how long it will take them to print 100 pages together. Hmm, let me think about this.\n\nWait, each printer is printing at \u00bd a page per second. So, in one second, Printer A does 0.5 pages and Printer B does the same. So together, they must be doing more than that. Oh right, I think when you have two things working together, you add their rates. So combined, they do 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 page per second. Oh, that makes sense. \n\nSo if together they can print 1 page every second, how long for 100 pages? Well, 100 pages divided by 1 page per second would be 100 seconds. Wait, but wait, let me double-check. Because if each does 0.5 per second, together it's 1 per second. So yeah, 100 pages would take 100 seconds. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 100 seconds. So the answer should be C. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the rates. Each is \u00bd page per second. So in one second, A does 0.5, B does 0.5. Together, 1 page per second. So 100 pages would take 100 seconds. Yeah, that seems right.\n",

The question is asking how long it will take them to print 100 pages together. Hmm, let me think through this.\n\nWait, each printer's speed is 1/2 page per second. So, Printer A does 0.5 pages every second, and Printer B also does 0.5 pages per second. When they work together, I guess their rates add up. So combined, they should be printing 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 page per second. Oh, right, because they're working simultaneously, their rates add.\n\nSo if together they can print 1 page each second, then for 100 pages, it should take 100 seconds, right? Because 100 pages divided by 1 page per second equals 100 seconds. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Sometimes I get confused between rates and times.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: How much does each printer contribute? Let's say they work for t seconds. Printer A would print 0.5 * t pages, and Printer B would also print 0.5 * t pages. Together, 0.5t + 0.5t = t pages. So together, they print t pages in t seconds. So to get 100 pages, t must be 100.
