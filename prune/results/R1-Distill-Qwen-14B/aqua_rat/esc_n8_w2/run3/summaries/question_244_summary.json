      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe question states: If m is greater than 0, y is greater than 0, and x is m percent of 4y, then in terms of y, m is what percentage of x? The options are A to E, and I need to pick the correct one.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. First, I know that when something is a certain percentage of another thing, it involves multiplying by that percentage as a decimal. So, if x is m percent of 4y, I can write that as an equation.\n\nSo, x equals (m percent) of 4y. Mathematically, that would be x = (m/100) * 4y. Wait, because m percent is m divided by 100, right? So, yeah, that equation makes sense.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nx = (m/100) * 4y.\n\nI can simplify this equation to make it easier to work with. Let's see, 4y multiplied by m/100 is the same as (4m y)/100. So, x = (4m y)/100.\n\nBut wait, I need to find m as a percentage of x. Hmm. So, the question is asking, m is what percentage of x? So, mathematically, that's (m / x) * 100 percent. Because when you want to find A as a percentage of B, it's (A/B)*100%.\n\nSo, I need to compute (m / x) * 100. But since I have x in terms of m and y, I can substitute that in.\n\nSo, substituting x from earlier, which is (4m y)/100, into the equation:\n\n(m / x) * 100 = [m / ( (4m y)/100 ) ] * 100.\n\nLet me compute that. Let's first simplify the denominator. The denominator is (4m y)/100, so dividing by that is the same as multiplying by 100/(4m y). So,\n\n[m * (100)/(4m y)] * 100.\n\nWait, let me make sure I did that right. So, m divided by (something) is m multiplied by the reciprocal of that something. So, m / ( (4m y)/100 ) equals m * (100)/(4m y).\n\nNow, I can cancel out the m terms. The m in the numerator and the m in the denominator will cancel each other out. So, that leaves:\n\n(100)/(4y) * 100.\n\nWait, wait, no, wait. Let me re-calculate. Because the entire expression is [m * 100/(4m y)] * 100.\n\nWait, no, no, that's not right. Let me do it again step by step.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n[m / ( (4m y)/100 ) ] * 100.\n\nWhich is equal to m * (100/(4m y)) ) * 100.\n\nWait, no, no. Wait, the entire expression is (m divided by x) times 100. x is (4m y)/100. So, substituting:\n\n(m) / [ (4m y)/100 ] * 100.\n\nSo, that's equal to m multiplied by 100/(4m y) multiplied by 100.\n\nWait, let me write that again:\n\n(m) divided by (4m y / 100) equals m * (100)/(4m y).\n\nThen, I multiply that by 100 to get the percentage. So,\n\n[ m * (100) / (4m y) ) ] * 100.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the initial expression is (m/x) * 100. So, x is (4m y)/100. So,\n\n(m) / [ (4m y)/100 ] = m * (100)/(4m y).\n\nThe m's cancel: m in numerator and denominator cancels.\n\nSo, 100/(4 y) = 25/(y).\n\nWait, because 100 divided by 4 is 25. So that's 25/y.\n\nNow, multiply that by 100 to get the percentage: (25/y) * 100 = (2500)/y.\n\nSo, that's 2500 divided by y, which is 2500/y percent.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me think again.\n\nWait, I'm trying to find m as a percentage of x. So, (m /x)*100.\n\nFrom the initial substitution, x is (4m y)/100.\n\nSo, m/x is m / [(4m y)/100] = m * (100)/(4m y) = (100)/(4y) * (m/m) \u2192 since m/m is 1, it's 100/(4y) = 25/y.\n\nMultiply by 100 to get the percentage: (25/y) * 100 = 2500/y.\n\nSo, m is (2500/y) percent of x.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is 2500/y, and option E is 5000/y.\n\nHmm. So according to my calculation, it's 2500/y, which would be option D.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Let me retrace the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. x is m% of 4y \u2192 x = (m/100) *4y \u2192 x = (4 m y)/100.\n\n2. m as a percentage of x is (m/x)*100 \u2192 so (m / x) *100.\n\n3. Substitute x: (m / (4 m y / 100 )) * 100.\n\n4. Simplify denominator: m divided by (4 m y /100) \u2192 m * (100)/(4 m y) \u2192 the m's cancel \u2192 100/(4 y) = 25/(y).\n\n5. Multiply by 100 to get percentage: 25/(y) *100 = 2500/y.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the answer should be D, which is 2500/y.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options:\n\nA) y/400\n\nB)4y\n\nC)50y\n\nD)2500/y\n\nE)5000/y\n\nSo option D is 2500/y, which matches our result.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think if I interpreted the question correctly. The problem says, m is what percentage of x. So m is a percentage of x. So, yes, (m/x)*100%.\n\nWait, but sometimes these percentage problems can be tricky. Let me check with sample numbers. Let me pick numbers where I know m and y, compute x, then compute m as a percentage of x to see if it matches 2500/y.\n\nLet's say y = 2. Then, suppose m is 100 (so m=100, y=2).\n\nCompute x: x is m% of 4y \u2192 4y = 8. m% is 100%, so x=100% of 8 is 8.\n\nSo x=8.\n\nNow, m is 100, x is 8. What is 100 as a percentage of 8?\n\nWell, (100/8)*100% = (12.5)*100% = 1250%. Hmm.\n\nBut according to the formula 2500/y, when y=2, 2500/2=1250. So that's correct.\n\nAnother example: y=5, m=20.\n\nx is 20% of 4*5=20. 20% of 20 is 4. So x=4.\n\nm is 20. What is 20 as a percentage of 4? (20/4)*100 = 500%.\n\nUsing 2500/y: 2500/5=500. Correct again.\n\nSo the formula seems to hold. So the answer must be D.\n",

But wait, no, wait, 100 divided by 4 is 25? Wait, 4 times 25 is 100, right. So yes, 100/4 is 25. So, m = (25x)/(y).\n\nSo, m is 25x divided by y.\n\nNow, the question is, m is what percentage of x? So, percentage = (m / x) * 100%.\n\nSubstituting m from above: percentage = ( (25x / y) / x ) * 100%.\n\nThe x in the numerator and denominator will cancel out, so we have (25 / y) * 100%.\n\nWhich is (25 * 100) / y %.\n\n25 times 100 is 2500, so that's 2500 / y %.\n\nWait, so the percentage is 2500/y %.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 2500/y. So that must be the answer.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again, x = (m/100)*4y.\n\nSo, x = (4m y)/100.\n\nSo, m = (100x) / (4y) = (25x)/y. That's correct.\n\nThen, m is what percentage of x? So, (m / x) * 100% = (25x/y / x) * 100% = 25/y * 100% = 2500/y %.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the answer should be D.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start with the given information: \\( x \\) is \\( m\\% \\) of \\( 4y \\). This translates to the equation:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{m}{100} \\cdot 4y\n\\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4my}{100}\n\\]\n\nRearranging to solve for \\( m \\), we multiply both sides by \\( 100 \\) and divide by \\( 4y \\):\n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{100x}{4y} = \\frac{25x}{y}\n\\]\n\nThe question asks for \\( m \\) as a percentage of \\( x \\). Using the percentage formula, \\( \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{m}{x} \\right) \\cdot 100\\% \\), we substitute \\( m = \\frac{25x}{y} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\frac{25x}{y}}{x} \\right) \\cdot 100\\% = \\left( \\frac{25}{y} \\right) \\cdot 100\\% = \\frac{2500}{y}\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: D**",
