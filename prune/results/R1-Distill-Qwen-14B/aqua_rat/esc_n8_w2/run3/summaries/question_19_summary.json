      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the average score for a class when you exclude the highest and lowest scorers. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nAlright, let's read the problem again to make sure I get all the details. The exam has an average (arithmetic mean) of the highest and lowest scores equal to x. The overall average for the entire class is y, and there are z students, where z is more than 5. I need to find the average score when we exclude the highest and lowest scorers, expressed in terms of x, y, and z.\n\nLet me jot down what I know:\n\n- Let\u2019s denote the highest score as H and the lowest as L.\n- The average of H and L is x. So, (H + L)/2 = x \u2192 H + L = 2x.\n- The average score for the entire class is y. Since there are z students, the total sum of all scores is z * y.\n- When we exclude H and L, the number of students becomes z - 2. So the sum of the remaining scores is total sum minus H and L, which is zy - (H + L).\n\nWait, because H + L is 2x, so the sum of the remaining is zy - 2x. Then, the average for these z-2 students is (zy - 2x)/(z - 2). Oh wait, that's looking like one of the options.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is (zy - 2x)/(z - 2), which matches what I just got. So I think that's the correct answer.\n\nLet me just make sure I didn't miss anything. The total sum is zy because the average is y. Subtracting H and L, which sum to 2x, gives zy - 2x. Then, dividing by the number of students left, which is z-2. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nSo the average score excluding the highest and lowest is (zy - 2x)/(z - 2), which is option D.\n",

Oh right, so the average of two numbers is their sum divided by two. So if I denote the highest score as H and the lowest as L, then (H + L)/2 = x. That means H + L = 2x. Got that part down.\n\nNext, the average score for the entire class is y. Since there are z students, the total sum of all scores must be z times y. So total = z * y.\n\nThe question asks for the average score when we exclude the highest and lowest scorers. So that would leave us with (z - 2) students. To find the average for these, I need the sum of their scores divided by (z - 2).\n\nLet me think about how to get that sum. The total sum of all students is z*y.

Let's see, another approach: if the average of the class is y, then the sum is zy. The average excluding the two extremes is (sum without H and L) divided by (z-2).
