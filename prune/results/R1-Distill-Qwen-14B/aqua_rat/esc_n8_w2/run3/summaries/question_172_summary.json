      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Christopher and Jonathan flipping a coin twenty times. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of problems, but I'll take it slow.\n\nSo, the setup is that every time the coin lands on heads, Christopher gives $2 to Jonathan. And when it's tails, Jonathan gives $3 to Christopher. After flipping the coin twenty times, neither of them has won or lost any money. So, they broke even. I need to find out how many times the coin landed on heads.\n\nLet me think about this. Each head results in a loss of $2 for Christopher, but each tail gives him $3. So, the total money exchanged depends on the number of heads and tails.\n\nLet me denote the number of heads as H and tails as T. Since they flipped the coin 20 times, H + T must equal 20. That's one equation right there.\n\nNow, the total money change for each person. For Christopher, every head costs him $2, so that's a loss of 2H dollars. For each tail, he gains $3, so that's a gain of 3T dollars. His net change would be 3T - 2H.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that after all the flips, neither has won or lost any amount. So both of their net changes are zero. So, for Jonathan, I think his net change is the opposite of Christopher's. Because whenever it's heads, Jonathan gains $2, so 2H. And for tails, he loses $3, so -3T. So Jonathan's net is 2H - 3T. But since neither won nor lost, both net changes must be zero.\n\nWait, maybe I should just model it from one person's perspective. Let's take Christopher. His net gain is 3T - 2H, and this must equal zero because he didn't win or lose anything. So, 3T - 2H = 0.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because each tail brings him +3, each head brings -2. So the sum must be zero. So, 3T = 2H. So, T = (2/3)H.\n\nAnd we also know that H + T = 20. So substituting T from the first equation into the second.\n\nH + (2/3)H = 20.\n\nLet me compute that. H plus two-thirds H is (5/3)H. So, (5/3)H = 20. Multiply both sides by 3: 5H = 60. Then H = 12.\n\nSo the number of heads is 12. Let me check the options. Option E is 12.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me plug it back in.\n\nH is 12, so T is 20 -12 = 8.\n\nSo, for Christopher: 3T = 3*8=24. 2H=2*12=24. So, 24-24=0. That's correct.\n\nFor Jonathan: each head gives him +2, so 12*2=24. Each tail he loses 3, so 8*3=24. So 24-24=0. Yep, that works.\n\nSo the answer should be E)12.\n",
