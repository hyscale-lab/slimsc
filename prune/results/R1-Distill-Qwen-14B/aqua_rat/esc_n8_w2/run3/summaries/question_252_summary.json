      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a worker who drives to work and then cycles back the same route. Hmm, let me read it again carefully. \n\nThe question says it takes the worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average speed of 20 kilometers per hour. Now, they want to know how many minutes it will take the worker to cycle the same route at an average speed of 6 kilometers per hour. The options are from A to E, with E being 40. \n\nWait, so the key here is that the distance from home to work is the same for both driving and cycling. So first, I think I need to find the distance of the route, then use that distance to find the time it takes when cycling at a slower speed.\n\nRight, speed is distance over time. So the formula I remember is: \n\nSpeed = Distance / Time\n\nWhich can be rearranged to Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time. \n\nBut wait, the time given is in minutes, and the speed is in kilometers per hour. I need to make sure the units match. Oh right, I should convert the time from minutes to hours to match the speed's unit.\n\nSo the time taken to drive is 9 minutes. To convert that into hours, I divide by 60 because there are 60 minutes in an hour. Let me calculate that. 9 divided by 60 is 0.15 hours. \n\nNow, using the formula, the distance would be speed multiplied by time. So for driving, it's 20 km/h multiplied by 0.15 hours. Let me compute that. 20 times 0.15 is 3. So the distance from home to work is 3 kilometers. \n\nWait, that makes sense? 20 km/h for 9 minutes\u2014since 9 minutes is less than an hour, the distance should be less than 20 km. Yeah, 3 km is right. \n\nNow, the worker is cycling the same 3 km, but at a speed of 6 km/h. Again, using the same formula, Time = Distance / Speed. \n\nSo the time in hours would be 3 km divided by 6 km/h. That's 0.5 hours. But the question asks for the time in minutes, so I need to convert 0.5 hours back to minutes. 0.5 multiplied by 60 is 30 minutes. \n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations. \n\nDriving: 20 km/h for 9 minutes. 9 minutes is 9/60 = 0.15 hours. 20 * 0.15 = 3 km. Correct. \n\nCycling: 3 km at 6 km/h. Time is 3/6 = 0.5 hours. 0.5 *60=30 minutes. So the time is 30 minutes. \n\nLooking at the options, option A is 30. So the answer should be A.\n\nBut wait, the options given are A)30, B)32, etc. So I think I'm confident that 30 is the correct answer. So the answer is A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine how long it takes the worker to cycle from home to work, we first calculate the distance of the route using the driving scenario. The worker drives at an average speed of 20 km/h for 9 minutes. Converting 9 minutes to hours gives:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time (hours)} = \\frac{9}{60} = 0.15 \\, \\text{hours}.\n\\]\n\nUsing the formula \\( \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} \\), the distance is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = 20 \\, \\text{km/h} \\times 0.15 \\, \\text{hours} = 3 \\, \\text{km}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the time it takes to cycle the same 3 km at an average speed of 6 km/h.

The worker's driving time is 9 minutes. But wait, the speed is in hours, so I need to convert the time to hours to match the units.
