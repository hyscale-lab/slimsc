      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where Fernando bought a meal plan that allows him 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. The question is about figuring out how many options he has to allocate his meals. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. The cafeteria is closed on weekends, so that means it's only open Monday to Friday. So that's 5 days for both lunch and dinner. But wait, the problem says he always goes home for dinner on Friday nights. Oh right, so dinner on Friday is at home, not at the cafeteria. So for dinners, he can only eat at the cafeteria from Monday to Thursday, right? Because Friday dinner is at home.\n\nSo, for lunch, he can go to the cafeteria every day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. He needs to choose 3 of those days for lunch. Similarly, for dinner, he can go to the cafeteria Monday to Thursday (4 days) because Friday is off. He needs to choose 3 dinners from those 4 days.\n\nWait wait, but the problem states that he has 3 dinners per week. Oh, but he goes home on Friday nights, so he must be eating dinner at the cafeteria on 3 of the 4 available days (Mon-Thu). So for dinners, he's choosing 3 out of 4 days. So the number of ways is the combination of 4 choose 3.\n\nFor lunches, since he can go to the cafeteria 5 days (Mon-Fri), he needs to pick 3 days out of those 5. So that's 5 choose 3.\n\nSo the total options would be the product of these two combinations. So 5C3 multiplied by 4C3.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 5C3 * 4C3. That matches what I'm thinking.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The question is about allocating his meals. So for lunch, he's choosing 3 days out of 5. For dinner, he's choosing 3 days out of 4 (since Friday is excluded). So yes, each is independent, so multiply the combinations.\n\nOther options: Let's see the others. Option B is 5C4 *4C2. Hmm, that would imply choosing 4 days for lunch and 2 for dinner. But he's only allowed 3 each. So that can't be right.\n\nOption C is 5C2 *4C4. 5 choose 2 is 10, 4 choose 4 is 1. So that's 10, which is way too low. So not C.\n\nOption D: 5C6? Wait, 5 choose 6 is zero because you can't choose 6 items from 5. So that's invalid. So D is out.\n\nOption E: 4C3 *4C3. That would mean both lunch and dinner are chosen from 4 days each. But lunch has 5 days. So E is incorrect.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option A.\n",

The cafeteria is closed on weekends, which I guess means Saturday and Sunday. And he goes home for dinner every Friday night. Hmm, so I need to figure out how many ways he can allocate his meals under these conditions.\n\nWait, let's think about the days. The week has 7 days, but the cafeteria is closed on weekends, so that's two days where he can't eat there. So he can only eat at the cafeteria from Monday to Friday. That's 5 days a week.\n\nHe needs 3 lunches and 3 dinners. But wait, on Friday nights he goes home, so he can't have dinner at the cafeteria on Friday. So for dinners, how many days does he have available?\n\nWait, let me list out the days:\n\n- Monday to Thursday: 4 days.\n- Friday: he goes home, so no dinner at the cafeteria.\n- Saturday and Sunday: closed, so no meals.\n\nSo for dinners, the only days he can eat at the cafeteria are Monday to Thursday, that's 4 days. But he has 3 dinners to allocate. So how many ways can he choose 3 days out of those 4? That's a combination problem. So for dinners, it's 4 choose 3, which is 4C3.\n\nNow, for lunches. He has 3 lunches to use over the 5 days (Monday to Friday). Because on weekends, he can't have lunch either. So he can choose any of the 5 days for his 3 lunches. So that's 5 choose 3, which is 5C3.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Since he can only use each day once for each meal, right? Like, he can't have two meals on the same day. So for each meal type, he's choosing different days. So the allocation is independent for lunch and dinner.\n\nSo the total number of options would be the product of the two combinations. So 5C3 multiplied by 4C3.\n\nLooking at the options, let's check:\n\nOption A is 5C3 *4C3. That matches what I was thinking. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the other options. Option B is 5C4 *4C2. Hmm, that would be if he had 4 dinners and 2 lunches or something else. Doesn't fit. Option C is 5C2 *4C4. That seems off because 4C4 is 1, which would imply he uses all 4 days for dinners, but he only needs 3. So no.\n\nOption D is 5C6 and 4C5, which doesn't make sense because you can't choose 6 from 5, and 5 from 4 is also impossible. So D is invalid. Option E is 4C3 *4C3. That would be if both were 3, but for lunch, it's 5 days. So E is wrong.\n\nSo yeah, the correct calculation is 5C3 for lunch and 4C3 for dinner. So the answer is option A.\n",
