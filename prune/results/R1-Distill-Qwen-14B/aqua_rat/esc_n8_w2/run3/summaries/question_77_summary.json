      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about estimating the deer population in a forest. Hmm, I remember something about mark and recapture methods from biology class. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says that in 2001, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and then released back into the forest. Then, in 2002, they caught 500 deer at random, and out of those, 20 were found to have tags from the previous year.\n\nWait, the question is asking for the total deer population, right? And they mentioned that the percentage of tagged deer in the second sample is representative of the overall population. So I think I can use the Lincoln-Petersen estimator here, which is a method used in ecology to estimate animal populations.\n\nThe formula for Lincoln-Petersen is: Total Population \u2248 (Number tagged initially \u00d7 Total number captured in second sample) / Number recaptured in second sample.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. So the initial number tagged is 300. The second sample is 500 deer, and in that sample, 20 were tagged. So the calculation would be (300 * 500) / 20.\n\nLet me compute that. 300 times 500 is 150,000. Divided by 20 gives 7,500. So the total population would be approximately 7,500.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm applying the formula correctly. The idea is that the proportion of tagged deer in the second sample should reflect the proportion in the entire population. So if 20 out of 500 were tagged, that's 4% (20/500=0.04). So the assumption is that 4% of the total population is equal to the number of tagged deer, which was 300.\n\nSo if 4% of the total population is 300, then the total population would be 300 divided by 0.04. Let me calculate that. 300 divided by 0.04 is 7500. Yep, that's the same as before.\n\nSo looking at the options, option E is 7500. That should be the correct answer. I don't think I made any mistakes here. Both methods\u2014using the formula and the proportion approach\u2014give the same result.\n",

The question is asking for the total deer population, assuming the percentage of tagged deer in the sample is the same as the overall population.\n\nWait, right, the capture-recapture method uses the ratio of tagged animals in the second capture to estimate the total population. The formula I remember is something like (number tagged initially) divided by (total population) equals (number recaptured) divided by (total captured in second catch). So, in formula terms, it's (T/N) = (t/C), where T is the initial number tagged, N is the total population, t is the number recaptured, and C is the total caught in the second time.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. T is 300, t is 20, and C is 500. So the equation would be 300/N = 20/500. Hmm, let's solve for N.\n\nWait, 20 divided by 500 is 0.04. So 300 divided by N equals 0.04. To find N, I can rearrange that. 300 = 0.04 * N. So N equals 300 divided by 0.04. Let me calculate that.\n\n300 divided by 0.04. Well, 0.04 is the same as 4%, so 300 is 4% of what number?

Alternatively, I've heard of the Lincoln-Petersen estimator, which is N \u2248 (M * C) / R, where M is the number marked in the first capture, C is the total captured in the second, and R is the number recaptured.
