      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again. The greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11. Their least common multiple (LCM) is 7700. One of the integers is 350, and I need to find the other one. The options are A to E.\n\nHmm, I remember that GCF and LCM have a relationship with the product of the two numbers. Oh right, the formula is GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b. So if I can use that, I should be able to find the missing number.\n\nWait, let me make sure I remember the formula correctly. Yes, I think it's correct. So the product of the GCF and LCM of two numbers equals the product of the numbers themselves.\n\nGiven that, I can plug in the numbers I know. The GCF is 11, and the LCM is 7700. One of the numbers is 350. Let's denote the two numbers as a and b. Let's say a is 350 and b is what we're looking for.\n\nSo according to the formula: 11 * 7700 = 350 * b.\n\nLet me calculate the left side first. 11 multiplied by 7700. Let's see, 7700 * 10 is 77000, so 7700 *11 is 77000 + 7700 = 84700. So 84700 equals 350 multiplied by b.\n\nSo now I can solve for b. b = 84700 / 350.\n\nWait, let me compute that division. 350 goes into 84700 how many times? Let me see. 350 times 200 is 70,000. 350 times 240 is 84,000 (because 200*350 is 70,000, 40*350=14,000; 70k+14k=84k). So 84,000 is 350*240. But 84,700 is 700 more than 84,000. So 700 divided by 350 is 2. So 240 + 2 is 242. So b is 242.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. I should double-check this because sometimes with GCF and LCM, just using the formula might not account for some conditions. Let me verify if 350 and 242 have a GCF of 11 and an LCM of 7700.\n\nFirst, let's find the GCF of 350 and 242.\n\nBreaking them down into prime factors.\n\n350: Let's see, 350 is 35 * 10, which is 5*7 * 2*5. So prime factors are 2, 5\u00b2, 7.\n\n242: 242 divided by 2 is 121, which is 11\u00b2. So factors are 2 * 11\u00b2.\n\nThe GCF is the product of the smallest powers of common primes. Both have 2^1, so GCF is 2. Wait, that's not right because the problem states the GCF is 11. Oh no, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, that can't be. Because if the GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11. But 350 is 35 *10, which is 5*7*2*5. So 350 doesn't have 11 as a factor. Wait, wait, that's a big issue. Because if the GCF is 11, both numbers must be divisible by 11. But 350 isn't divisible by 11. Because 350 divided by 11 is approximately 31.81, which isn't an integer. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, so maybe I messed up the calculation earlier. Let me check the initial formula again. Wait, the formula says GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b. But if GCF is 11, and one number is 350, which is not a multiple of 11, that would imply that the GCF is 1, not 11. So this is a contradiction. That means either the problem has a mistake, or I made a wrong assumption.\n\nWait, no, maybe I got the formula wrong. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me think again. Oh wait, the formula is correct. So if GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11. Because the GCF is the largest number that divides both. So if the GCF is 11, both numbers are divisible by 11.\n\nBut 350 isn't divisible by 11. Let me check: 11 *31 is 341, 11*32=352. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. That's a problem. So either the problem is wrong, or I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, but according to the problem, the GCF is 11 and one number is 350. So 350 must be a multiple of 11. But 350 isn't. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Or maybe I miscalculated earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check my initial calculation again. Let me recompute 11 * 7700.\n\n11 * 7700: 7700 *10 is 77,000. Plus 7700 is 84,700. So 84,700 is correct.\n\nThen 84,700 divided by 350. Let's compute that again. 350 * 242 is 84,700. So that's correct. But 350 is not a multiple of 11, which contradicts the GCF being 11.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the mistake is in the assumption that both numbers are divisible by the GCF. Because the GCF is 11, yes, both numbers must be multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11. But it's not. So perhaps I'm miscalculating something else.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps the formula is GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b. So if a and b are 350 and x, then 11 * 7700 = 350 * x. So x = (11 * 7700)/350.\n\nWait, let me compute that. 11 *7700 = 84,700. 84,700 divided by 350. Let me see. 350 * 242 = 84,700. So x is 242.\n\nBut wait, 242 is 11 * 22, right? So 242 is a multiple of 11. 350 is not. That's a problem because their GCF is 11. So if 350 is not a multiple of 11, how can the GCF be 11? Because the GCF is the greatest common divisor, which must be a factor of both numbers.\n\nSo this suggests that either the problem is wrong, or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, maybe I should think differently.\n\nWait, maybe I should represent the numbers in terms of their prime factors. Since the GCF is 11, both numbers must have 11 as a factor. So let me write the numbers as 11*m and 11*n, where m and n are integers with GCF 1 (since we've factored out the GCF).\n\nWait, because if the GCF of a and b is 11, then a = 11*m, b=11*n, and the GCF of m and n is 1. Because any common factor of m and n would make the GCF of a and b higher than 11.\n\nThen, the LCM of a and b is given as 7700. The LCM of a and b would be 11*m*n, because since m and n are coprime, LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCF(a,b) = (11m *11n)/11 = 11 m n.\n\nSo 11 m n = 7700.\n\nSo m n = 7700 /11 = 700.\n\nSo m * n =700.\n\nNow, one of the numbers is 350. Let's say a is 350. So a=11*m=350. So m =350/11. But 350 divided by 11 is 31.818..., which is not an integer. So that's impossible because m must be an integer.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because if a is 350, which is 11*m, m would have to be 350/11, which is not an integer. So that can't be. Therefore, a can't be 350 because that would make m non-integer, which is impossible. So this suggests that perhaps the given information is wrong, or I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait, but the problem says one of the integers is 350. So perhaps the mistake is that 350 is not a multiple of 11, which would imply that the GCF can't be 11. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should think again. Let me go back to the problem. The GCF is 11, and one number is 350. So 350 must be a multiple of 11. But 350 divided by 11 is 31.818... So it's not. So that's impossible. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the GCF. Let me check the GCF of 350 and 242. Wait, 350 is 2*5^2*7. 242 is 2*11^2. The common factors are 2, so GCF is 2, not 11. Which contradicts the problem statement. So that can't be.\n\nWait a minute, so if according to my calculation, the other number is 242, but that gives a GCF of 2, not 11. So my initial approach must be wrong. So perhaps I should think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is correct, and I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the formula is different. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps the formula is correct, but I'm applying it wrong.\n\nWait, let me try a different approach. Let me denote the two numbers as a and b. Let a=350, and b is what we're looking for. GCF(a, b)=11, LCM(a, b)=7700.\n\nWe can write a as 11 * m, and b as 11 * n, where m and n are coprime (since 11 is the GCF). So a=11*m=350. So m=350/11=31.818, which is not an integer. So that can't be. So that suggests that the problem is wrong because a can't be 350 if the GCF is 11.\n\nBut the problem states that one of the integers is 350, so perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the formula is incorrect? No, I'm pretty sure the formula is correct. So perhaps the problem has a mistake, but since it's a question, I have to find an answer from the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try the options to see which one fits. Let's look at the options:\n\nOptions:\nA)242\nB)308\nC)352\nD)412\nE)456\n\nSo let's compute for each option, the GCF with 350 and the LCM, then see which one matches.\n\nLet me start with option A: 242.\n\nCheck GCF(350,242). 350 factors: 2*5\u00b2*7. 242: 2*11\u00b2. Common factor is 2. So GCF is 2. Not 11. So A is out.\n\nOption B: 308.\n\n308: Let's factor it. 308 divided by 2 is 154. 154/2=77. 77 is 7*11. So 308=2\u00b2 *7 *11.\n\n350 is 2*5\u00b2*7.\n\nSo the common factors are 2 and 7. So GCF is 2*7=14. But the problem states the GCF is 11, so B is out.\n\nOption C:352.\n\n352: Let's see, 352 divided by 2 is 176. 176/2=88. 88/2=44. 44/2=22. 22/2=11. So 352=2^6 *11.\n\n350: 2*5\u00b2 *7.\n\nCommon factors: 2^1. So GCF is 2, not 11. So C is out.\n\nOption D:412.\n\n412: 412 divided by 2 is 206. 206/2=103. 103 is a prime number. So 412=2\u00b2 *103.\n\n350: 2*5\u00b2*7. So common factor is 2. GCF is 2. Not 11. So D is out.\n\nOption E:456.\n\n456: 456 divided by 2 is 228. 228/2=114. 114/2=57. 57 is 3*19. So 456=2\u00b3 *3 *19.\n\n350: 2*5\u00b2 *7. Common factor is 2. So GCF is 2. Not 11. So E is out.\n\nWait, so all the options have a GCF of 2 with 350. But the problem says the GCF is 11. So none of the options satisfy the GCF condition. So what's going on here? Did I make a mistake in the initial approach?\n\nWait, but the problem says the GCF is 11, and one of the integers is 350. So according to the formula, the other number should be 242. But as we saw, that gives a GCF of 2. So there's a contradiction.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check the formula again. The formula is GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a*b. So 11 *7700 = 350 * x. So x= (11*7700)/350= 84700/350=242.\n\nSo the other number must be 242. But 242 doesn't have a GCF of 11 with 350, as we saw. So this suggests that the problem is inconsistent. But since the options include 242 (option A), perhaps that's the intended answer, even though it doesn't fit the GCF condition. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, let me recheck the GCF of 350 and 242. 350 is 2*5\u00b2*7. 242 is 2*11\u00b2. So the only common prime factor is 2, so GCF is 2. So that's correct. So if the problem states that the GCF is 11, but the numbers would have a GCF of 2, then perhaps the problem has an error.\n\nBut the options given include 242 as option A. So perhaps the answer is A, 242, even though it doesn't satisfy the GCF condition. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the problem is correct, and I'm miscalculating the GCF. Let me compute GCD(350,242) using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nCompute GCD(350,242):\n\n350 divided by 242 is 1 with a remainder of 108 (350 - 242=108).\n\nNow compute GCD(242,108).\n\n242 divided by 108 is 2 with remainder 26 (108*2=216; 242-216=26).\n\nNow compute GCD(108,26).\n\n108 divided by 26 is 4 with remainder 4 (26*4=104; 108-104=4).\n\nNow compute GCD(26,4).\n\n26 divided by 4 is 6 with remainder 2.\n\nNow compute GCD(4,2).\n\n4 divided by 2 is 2 with remainder 0. So GCD is 2.\n\nSo yes, the GCF is 2, not 11. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, so according to this, the correct other number is 242, but that doesn't have the right GCF. So perhaps the problem has a typo, but given the options, the only possible answer is A)242, which is the result of the formula, even though it doesn't fit the GCF condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should re-examine the initial approach. Could there be another way to approach this problem?\n\nWait, perhaps I can factor 350 and the possible options into their prime factors and see which one, when combined with 350, gives the LCM of 7700 and GCF of 11.\n\nLet me factor 350: 2 *5^2 *7.\n\nNow, let's factor each option:\n\nA)242: 2 * 11^2.\n\nB)308: 2^2 *7 *11.\n\nC)352: 2^6 *11.\n\nD)412: 2^2 *103.\n\nE)456: 2^3 *3 *19.\n\nNow, let's compute the LCM of 350 and each option and see if it's 7700.\n\nThe LCM of two numbers is the product of the highest powers of all primes present in either number.\n\nLet's start with A)242: 2*11^2.\n\n350 is 2*5^2*7.\n\nSo LCM would be 2 *5^2 *7 *11^2.\n\nCalculate that: 2*25*7*121.\n\n2*25=50; 50*7=350; 350*121=42350.\n\nWhich is way larger than 7700. So A can't be the answer.\n\nOption B)308: 2^2 *7 *11.\n\n350 is 2*5^2*7.\n\nSo LCM would be 2^2 *5^2 *7 *11.\n\nCalculating that: 4 *25=100; 100*7=700; 700*11=7700.\n\nOh, that's exactly the LCM given. So LCM is 7700.\n\nNow, what's the GCF of 350 and 308?\n\n350: 2*5\u00b2*7.\n\n308:2\u00b2*7*11.\n\nThe GCF is the product of the minimum exponents of common primes. Common primes are 2^1, 7^1.\n\nSo GCF is 2*7=14.\n\nBut the problem states that GCF is 11. So that's a problem. So option B gives LCM 7700 but GCF 14, which doesn't match.\n\nSo B is out.\n\nOption C)352: 2^6 *11.\n\n350: 2*5^2*7.\n\nLCM would be 2^6 *5^2 *7 *11.\n\nWhich is 64 *25 *7 *11.\n\n64*25=1600; 1600*7=11200; 11200*11=123200. Way bigger than 7700. So C is out.\n\nOption D)412: 2\u00b2 *103.\n\n350:2*5\u00b2*7.\n\nLCM is 2\u00b2 *5\u00b2 *7 *103.\n\nWhich is 4 *25=100; 100 *7=700; 700 *103=72100. Not 7700. So D is out.\n\nOption E)456: 2\u00b3 *3 *19.\n\n350: 2*5\u00b2*7.\n\nLCM would be 2^3 *3 *5^2 *7 *19.\n\nWhich is 8 *3=24; 24 *25=600; 600*7=4200; 4200 *19=79800. Not 7700. So E is out.\n\nWait, so only option B gives LCM of 7700, but its GCF is 14, not 11. So none of the options satisfy both conditions.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Because according to the formula, the other number should be 242, but that doesn't satisfy the GCF condition. But according to the options, 242 is an option (A), but when I compute the LCM of 350 and 242, I get 42350, which is much larger than 7700. So that can't be.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me compute the LCM of 350 and 242 again.\n\n350 factors: 2*5\u00b2*7.\n\n242: 2*11\u00b2.\n\nSo LCM is 2 *5\u00b2 *7 *11\u00b2.\n\nWhich is 2*25=50; 50*7=350; 350 *121=42350. So yes, way too big.\n\nSo that's not the right answer.\n\nWait, but the formula says that 11 *7700 =350 * x. So x=242. But that doesn't fit the GCF condition. So perhaps the problem is wrong, but since I have to choose from the options, perhaps the correct answer is not there. But the options are A to E, and the problem says that one is 350.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's consider that the two numbers are a and b, with GCF 11 and LCM 7700. So a=11*m, b=11*n, where m and n are coprime.\n\nThen, LCM(a,b)=11*m*n=7700. So m*n=700.\n\nWe have a=350=11*m \u2192 m=350/11 \u224831.818, which is not integer. So that's impossible. So there's no such integer b that satisfies these conditions.\n\nWait, but the problem states that one of the integers is 350. So perhaps the problem has a typo, and the GCF is not 11, but something else. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if 350 and 308 have a GCF of 14 and LCM of 7700, as I saw earlier. So if the problem says GCF is 14, but it's given as 11, perhaps that's the intended answer, but I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a mistake, and the correct answer is not among the options. But since the options are given, perhaps the intended answer is A)242, even though it doesn't fit the GCF condition.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, it's 242. So perhaps the problem expects that, despite the inconsistency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another way to approach this: the product of the two numbers is GCF * LCM. So 350 * x =11 *7700=84700. So x=84700/350=242. So the other number is 242. But as we saw, the GCF is 2, not 11. So perhaps the problem is wrong, but the intended answer is 242.\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer is A)242.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem states that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11, their least common multiple (LCM) is 7700, and one of the integers is 350. The task is to find the other integer from the given options.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Relationship Between GCF and LCM**:  \n   The formula connecting GCF and LCM is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{GCF}(a, b) \\times \\text{LCM}(a, b) = a \\times b\n   \\]  \n   Substituting the given values:  \n   \\[\n   11 \\times 7700 = 350 \\times b\n   \\]  \n   Simplifying:  \n   \\[\n   84700 = 350 \\times b \\implies b = \\frac{84700}{350} = 242\n   \\]  \n   Thus, the other integer is calculated to be **242**.\n\n2. **Verification of GCF**:  \n   To ensure the GCF of 350 and 242 is indeed 11, their prime factorizations are:  \n   - \\(350 = 2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7\\)  \n   - \\(242 = 2 \\times 11^2\\)  \n   The common prime factor is \\(2\\), so the GCF is \\(2\\), not \\(11\\). This contradicts the problem's condition that the GCF is 11.\n\n3. **Analysis of Options**:  \n   Each option is tested to check if it satisfies both the GCF and LCM conditions with 350:  \n   - **A) 242**: LCM(350, 242) = \\(2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7 \\times 11^2 = 42350\\), which is much larger than 7700.  \n   - **B) 308**: LCM(350, 308) = \\(2^2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7 \\times 11 = 7700\\), but GCF(350, 308) = \\(2 \\times 7 = 14\\), not 11.  \n   - **C) 352**: LCM(350, 352) = \\(2^6 \\times 5^2 \\times 7 \\times 11 = 123200\\), which is much larger than 7700.  \n   - **D) 412**: LCM(350, 412) = \\(2^2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7 \\times 103 = 72100\\), which is much larger than 7700.  \n   - **E) 456**: LCM(350, 456) = \\(2^3 \\times 3 \\times 5^2 \\times 7 \\times 19 = 79800\\), which is much larger than 7700.  \n\n   None of the options satisfy both the GCF and LCM conditions simultaneously.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again. The greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11. Their least common multiple (LCM) is 7700. One of the integers is 350, and I need to find the other one. The options are A to E.\n\nHmm, I remember that GCF and LCM have a relationship with the product of the two numbers. Oh right, the formula is GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b. So if I can use that, I should be able to find the missing number.\n\nWait, let me make sure I remember the formula correctly.

Let's see, 7700 * 10 is 77000, so 7700 *11 is 77000 + 7700 = 84700. So 84700 equals 350 multiplied by b.\n\nSo now I can solve for b. b = 84700 / 350.\n\nWait, let me compute that division. 350 goes into 84700 how many times? Let me see. 350 times 200 is 70,000. 350 times 240 is 84,000 (because 200*350 is 70,000, 40*350=14,000; 70k+14k=84k). So 84,000 is 350*240. But 84,700 is 700 more than 84,000. So 700 divided by 350 is 2. So 240 + 2 is 242. So b is 242.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. I should double-check this because sometimes with GCF and LCM, just using the formula might not account for some conditions. Let me verify if 350 and 242 have a GCF of 11 and an LCM of 7700.\n\nFirst, let's find the GCF of 350 and 242.\n\nBreaking them down into prime factors.\n\n350: Let's see, 350 is 35 * 10, which is 5*7 * 2*5. So prime factors are 2, 5\u00b2, 7.\n\n242: 242 divided by 2 is 121, which is 11\u00b2. So factors are 2 * 11\u00b2.\n\nThe GCF is the product of the smallest powers of common primes. Both have 2^1, so GCF is 2. Wait, that's not right because the problem states the GCF is 11. Oh no, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, that can't be. Because if the GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11. But 350 is 35 *10, which is 5*7*2*5. So 350 doesn't have 11 as a factor. Wait, wait, that's a big issue. Because if the GCF is 11, both numbers must be divisible by 11. But 350 isn't divisible by 11. Because 350 divided by 11 is approximately 31.81, which isn't an integer. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, so maybe I messed up the calculation earlier. Let me check the initial formula again. Wait, the formula says GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b. But if GCF is 11, and one number is 350, which is not a multiple of 11, that would imply that the GCF is 1, not 11. So this is a contradiction. That means either the problem has a mistake, or I made a wrong assumption.\n\nWait, no, maybe I got the formula wrong. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me think again. Oh wait, the formula is correct. So if GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11. Because the GCF is the largest number that divides both. So if the GCF is 11, both numbers are divisible by 11.\n\nBut 350 isn't divisible by 11. Let me check: 11 *31 is 341, 11*32=352. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. That's a problem. So either the problem is wrong, or I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, but according to the problem, the GCF is 11 and one number is 350. So 350 must be a multiple of 11. But 350 isn't. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Or maybe I miscalculated earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check my initial calculation again. Let me recompute 11 * 7700.\n\n11 * 7700: 7700 *10 is 77,000. Plus 7700 is 84,700. So 84,700 is correct.\n\nThen 84,700 divided by 350. Let's compute that again. 350 * 242 is 84,700. So that's correct. But 350 is not a multiple of 11, which contradicts the GCF being 11.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the mistake is in the assumption that both numbers are divisible by the GCF. Because the GCF is 11, yes, both numbers must be multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11. But it's not. So perhaps I'm miscalculating something else.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps the formula is GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b. So if a and b are 350 and x, then 11 * 7700 = 350 * x. So x = (11 * 7700)/350.\n\nWait, let me compute that. 11 *7700 = 84,700. 84,700 divided by 350. Let me see. 350 * 242 = 84,700. So x is 242.\n\nBut wait, 242 is 11 * 22, right? So 242 is a multiple of 11. 350 is not. That's a problem because their GCF is 11. So if 350 is not a multiple of 11, how can the GCF be 11? Because the GCF is the greatest common divisor, which must be a factor of both numbers.\n\nSo this suggests that either the problem is wrong, or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, maybe I should think differently.\n\nWait, maybe I should represent the numbers in terms of their prime factors. Since the GCF is 11, both numbers must have 11 as a factor. So let me write the numbers as 11*m and 11*n, where m and n are integers with GCF 1 (since we've factored out the GCF).\n\nWait, because if the GCF of a and b is 11, then a = 11*m, b=11*n, and the GCF of m and n is 1. Because any common factor of m and n would make the GCF of a and b higher than 11.\n\nThen, the LCM of a and b is given as 7700. The LCM of a and b would be 11*m*n, because since m and n are coprime, LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCF(a,b) = (11m *11n)/11 = 11 m n.\n\nSo 11 m n = 7700.\n\nSo m n = 7700 /11 = 700.\n\nSo m * n =700.\n\nNow, one of the numbers is 350. Let's say a is 350. So a=11*m=350. So m =350/11. But 350 divided by 11 is 31.818..., which is not an integer. So that's impossible because m must be an integer.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because if a is 350, which is 11*m, m would have to be 350/11, which is not an integer. So that can't be. Therefore, a can't be 350 because that would make m non-integer, which is impossible. So this suggests that perhaps the given information is wrong, or I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait, but the problem says one of the integers is 350. So perhaps the mistake is that 350 is not a multiple of 11, which would imply that the GCF can't be 11. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should think again. Let me go back to the problem. The GCF is 11, and one number is 350. So 350 must be a multiple of 11. But 350 divided by 11 is 31.818... So it's not. So that's impossible. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the GCF. Let me check the GCF of 350 and 242. Wait, 350 is 2*5^2*7. 242 is 2*11^2. The common factors are 2, so GCF is 2, not 11. Which contradicts the problem statement. So that can't be.\n\nWait a minute, so if according to my calculation, the other number is 242, but that gives a GCF of 2, not 11. So my initial approach must be wrong. So perhaps I should think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is correct, and I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the formula is different. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps the formula is correct, but I'm applying it wrong.\n\nWait, let me try a different approach. Let me denote the two numbers as a and b. Let a=350, and b is what we're looking for. GCF(a, b)=11, LCM(a, b)=7700.\n\nWe can write a as 11 * m, and b as 11 * n, where m and n are coprime (since 11 is the GCF). So a=11*m=350. So m=350/11=31.818, which is not an integer. So that can't be. So that suggests that the problem is wrong because a can't be 350 if the GCF is 11.\n\nBut the problem states that one of the integers is 350, so perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the formula is incorrect? No, I'm pretty sure the formula is correct. So perhaps the problem has a mistake, but since it's a question, I have to find an answer from the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try the options to see which one fits. Let's look at the options:\n\nOptions:\nA)242\nB)308\nC)352\nD)412\nE)456\n\nSo let's compute for each option, the GCF with 350 and the LCM, then see which one matches.\n\nLet me start with option A: 242.\n\nCheck GCF(350,242). 350 factors: 2*5\u00b2*7. 242: 2*11\u00b2. Common factor is 2. So GCF is 2. Not 11. So A is out.\n\nOption B: 308.\n\n308: Let's factor it. 308 divided by 2 is 154. 154/2=77. 77 is 7*11. So 308=2\u00b2 *7 *11.\n\n350 is 2*5\u00b2*7.\n\nSo the common factors are 2 and 7. So GCF is 2*7=14. But the problem states the GCF is 11, so B is out.\n\nOption C:352.\n\n352: Let's see, 352 divided by 2 is 176. 176/2=88. 88/2=44. 44/2=22. 22/2=11. So 352=2^6 *11.\n\n350: 2*5\u00b2 *7.\n\nCommon factors: 2^1. So GCF is 2, not 11. So C is out.\n\nOption D:412.\n\n412: 412 divided by 2 is 206. 206/2=103. 103 is a prime number. So 412=2\u00b2 *103.\n\n350: 2*5\u00b2*7. So common factor is 2. GCF is 2. Not 11. So D is out.\n\nOption E:456.\n\n456: 456 divided by 2 is 228. 228/2=114. 114/2=57. 57 is 3*19. So 456=2\u00b3 *3 *19.\n\n350: 2*5\u00b2 *7. Common factor is 2. So GCF is 2. Not 11. So E is out.\n\nWait, so all the options have a GCF of 2 with 350. But the problem says the GCF is 11. So none of the options satisfy the GCF condition. So what's going on here? Did I make a mistake in the initial approach?\n\nWait, but the problem says the GCF is 11, and one of the integers is 350. So according to the formula, the other number should be 242. But as we saw, that gives a GCF of 2. So there's a contradiction.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check the formula again. The formula is GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a*b. So 11 *7700 = 350 * x. So x= (11*7700)/350= 84700/350=242.\n\nSo the other number must be 242. But 242 doesn't have a GCF of 11 with 350, as we saw. So this suggests that the problem is inconsistent. But since the options include 242 (option A), perhaps that's the intended answer, even though it doesn't fit the GCF condition. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, let me recheck the GCF of 350 and 242. 350 is 2*5\u00b2*7. 242 is 2*11\u00b2. So the only common prime factor is 2, so GCF is 2. So that's correct. So if the problem states that the GCF is 11, but the numbers would have a GCF of 2, then perhaps the problem has an error.\n\nBut the options given include 242 as option A. So perhaps the answer is A, 242, even though it doesn't satisfy the GCF condition. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the problem is correct, and I'm miscalculating the GCF. Let me compute GCD(350,242) using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nCompute GCD(350,242):\n\n350 divided by 242 is 1 with a remainder of 108 (350 - 242=108).\n\nNow compute GCD(242,108).\n\n242 divided by 108 is 2 with remainder 26 (108*2=216; 242-216=26).\n\nNow compute GCD(108,26).\n\n108 divided by 26 is 4 with remainder 4 (26*4=104; 108-104=4).\n\nNow compute GCD(26,4).\n\n26 divided by 4 is 6 with remainder 2.\n\nNow compute GCD(4,2).\n\n4 divided by 2 is 2 with remainder 0. So GCD is 2.\n\nSo yes, the GCF is 2, not 11. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, so according to this, the correct other number is 242, but that doesn't have the right GCF. So perhaps the problem has a typo, but given the options, the only possible answer is A)242, which is the result of the formula, even though it doesn't fit the GCF condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should re-examine the initial approach. Could there be another way to approach this problem?\n\nWait, perhaps I can factor 350 and the possible options into their prime factors and see which one, when combined with 350, gives the LCM of 7700 and GCF of 11.\n\nLet me factor 350: 2 *5^2 *7.\n\nNow, let's factor each option:\n\nA)242: 2 * 11^2.\n\nB)308: 2^2 *7 *11.\n\nC)352: 2^6 *11.\n\nD)412: 2^2 *103.\n\nE)456: 2^3 *3 *19.\n\nNow, let's compute the LCM of 350 and each option and see if it's 7700.\n\nThe LCM of two numbers is the product of the highest powers of all primes present in either number.\n\nLet's start with A)242: 2*11^2.\n\n350 is 2*5^2*7.\n\nSo LCM would be 2 *5^2 *7 *11^2.\n\nCalculate that: 2*25*7*121.\n\n2*25=50; 50*7=350; 350*121=42350.\n\nWhich is way larger than 7700. So A can't be the answer.\n\nOption B)308: 2^2 *7 *11.\n\n350 is 2*5^2*7.\n\nSo LCM would be 2^2 *5^2 *7 *11.\n\nCalculating that: 4 *25=100; 100*7=700; 700*11=7700.\n\nOh, that's exactly the LCM given. So LCM is 7700.\n\nNow, what's the GCF of 350 and 308?\n\n350: 2*5\u00b2*7.\n\n308:2\u00b2*7*11.\n\nThe GCF is the product of the minimum exponents of common primes. Common primes are 2^1, 7^1.\n\nSo GCF is 2*7=14.\n\nBut the problem states that GCF is 11. So that's a problem. So option B gives LCM 7700 but GCF 14, which doesn't match.\n\nSo B is out.\n\nOption C)352: 2^6 *11.\n\n350: 2*5^2*7.\n\nLCM would be 2^6 *5^2 *7 *11.\n\nWhich is 64 *25 *7 *11.\n\n64*25=1600; 1600*7=11200; 11200*11=123200. Way bigger than 7700. So C is out.\n\nOption D)412: 2\u00b2 *103.\n\n350:2*5\u00b2*7.\n\nLCM is 2\u00b2 *5\u00b2 *7 *103.\n\nWhich is 4 *25=100; 100 *7=700; 700 *103=72100. Not 7700. So D is out.\n\nOption E)456: 2\u00b3 *3 *19.\n\n350: 2*5\u00b2*7.\n\nLCM would be 2^3 *3 *5^2 *7 *19.\n\nWhich is 8 *3=24; 24 *25=600; 600*7=4200; 4200 *19=79800. Not 7700. So E is out.\n\nWait, so only option B gives LCM of 7700, but its GCF is 14, not 11. So none of the options satisfy both conditions.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Because according to the formula, the other number should be 242, but that doesn't satisfy the GCF condition. But according to the options, 242 is an option (A), but when I compute the LCM of 350 and 242, I get 42350, which is much larger than 7700. So that can't be.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me compute the LCM of 350 and 242 again.\n\n350 factors: 2*5\u00b2*7.\n\n242: 2*11\u00b2.\n\nSo LCM is 2 *5\u00b2 *7 *11\u00b2.\n\nWhich is 2*25=50; 50*7=350; 350 *121=42350. So yes, way too big.\n\nSo that's not the right answer.\n\nWait, but the formula says that 11 *7700 =350 * x. So x=242. But that doesn't fit the GCF condition. So perhaps the problem is wrong, but since I have to choose from the options, perhaps the correct answer is not there. But the options are A to E, and the problem says that one is 350.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's consider that the two numbers are a and b, with GCF 11 and LCM 7700. So a=11*m, b=11*n, where m and n are coprime.\n\nThen, LCM(a,b)=11*m*n=7700. So m*n=700.\n\nWe have a=350=11*m \u2192 m=350/11 \u224831.818, which is not integer. So that's impossible. So there's no such integer b that satisfies these conditions.\n\nWait, but the problem states that one of the integers is 350. So perhaps the problem has a typo, and the GCF is not 11, but something else. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if 350 and 308 have a GCF of 14 and LCM of 7700, as I saw earlier. So if the problem says GCF is 14, but it's given as 11, perhaps that's the intended answer, but I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a mistake, and the correct answer is not among the options. But since the options are given, perhaps the intended answer is A)242, even though it doesn't fit the GCF condition.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, it's 242. So perhaps the problem expects that, despite the inconsistency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another way to approach this: the product of the two numbers is GCF * LCM. So 350 * x =11 *7700=84700. So x=84700/350=242. So the other number is 242. But as we saw, the GCF is 2, not 11. So perhaps the problem is wrong, but the intended answer is 242.\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer is A)242.\n\n\nThe problem states that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11, their least common multiple (LCM) is 7700, and one of the integers is 350. The task is to find the other integer from the given options.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Relationship Between GCF and LCM**:  \n   The formula connecting GCF and LCM is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{GCF}(a, b) \\times \\text{LCM}(a, b) = a \\times b\n   \\]  \n   Substituting the given values:  \n   \\[\n   11 \\times 7700 = 350 \\times b\n   \\]  \n   Simplifying:  \n   \\[\n   84700 = 350 \\times b \\implies b = \\frac{84700}{350} = 242\n   \\]  \n   Thus, the other integer is calculated to be **242**.\n\n2. **Verification of GCF**:  \n   To ensure the GCF of 350 and 242 is indeed 11, their prime factorizations are:  \n   - \\(350 = 2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7\\)  \n   - \\(242 = 2 \\times 11^2\\)  \n   The common prime factor is \\(2\\), so the GCF is \\(2\\), not \\(11\\). This contradicts the problem's condition that the GCF is 11.\n\n3. **Analysis of Options**:  \n   Each option is tested to check if it satisfies both the GCF and LCM conditions with 350:  \n   - **A) 242**: LCM(350, 242) = \\(2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7 \\times 11^2 = 42350\\), which is much larger than 7700.  \n   - **B) 308**: LCM(350, 308) = \\(2^2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7 \\times 11 = 7700\\), but GCF(350, 308) = \\(2 \\times 7 = 14\\), not 11.  \n   - **C) 352**: LCM(350, 352) = \\(2^6 \\times 5^2 \\times 7 \\times 11 = 123200\\), which is much larger than 7700.  \n   - **D) 412**: LCM(350, 412) = \\(2^2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7 \\times 103 = 72100\\), which is much larger than 7700.  \n   - **E) 456**: LCM(350, 456) = \\(2^3 \\times 3 \\times 5^2 \\times 7 \\times 19 = 79800\\), which is much larger than 7700.  \n\n   None of the options satisfy both the GCF and LCM conditions simultaneously. However, the problem explicitly states that one integer is 350, and the formula yields 242 as the other integer.\n\n### Conclusion:\nDespite the inconsistency in the GCF condition, the formula-derived answer is **242**, which corresponds to option A. This suggests either a mistake in the problem's conditions or an expectation to proceed with the formula's result.\n\n**Answer: A**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about the greatest common factor and least common multiple of two numbers. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I remember that when dealing with GCF and LCM, there's a formula that connects them. Oh right, the product of the two numbers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM. So if I have two numbers, say a and b, then a * b = GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b). \n\nThe problem says the GCF is 11, and the LCM is 7700. One of the numbers is 350, and I need to find the other number. Let me denote the numbers as 350 and x, where x is the unknown.\n\nSo according to the formula, 350 * x = 11 * 7700. Let me compute that right-hand side first. 11 multiplied by 7700. Let's see, 7700 times 10 is 77000, so 7700 * 11 is 77000 + 7700 = 84700. So 350 * x = 84700.\n\nWait, so to find x, I can divide 84700 by 350. Let me do that calculation. Hmm, 350 times 240 is 84,000 because 350 * 200 is 70,000 and 350 * 40 is 14,000. Adding those gives 84,000. Then 84,700 minus 84,000 is 700. So 700 divided by 350 is 2. So x should be 240 + 2 = 242? Wait, but wait, 350 times 242 would be 350*(200 + 40 + 2) = 350*200=70,000; 350*40=14,000; 350*2=700. Adding those gives 70,000 +14,000=84,000 +700=84,700. Oh yes, that's correct. So x would be 242.\n\nWait a minute, but looking at the options, A is 242. But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Because sometimes when I'm working quickly, I might miscalculate. Let me double-check the formula. Yeah, a * b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So 350 * x = 11 * 7700.\n\nWait, 11 *7700 is 84700. 84700 divided by 350. Let me compute 350 into 84700. 350 times 240 is 84000. 84700 minus 84000 is 700. 700 divided by 350 is 2. So 240 + 2 =242. Yep, that's right.\n\nBut wait, another thought: the GCF is 11, which means both numbers must be multiples of 11. Let's check if 350 is a multiple of 11. 350 divided by 11. 11*31 is 341, 350-341=9, so no, 350 isn't a multiple of 11. Oh wait, that's a problem. Because if the GCF is 11, both numbers should be divisible by 11. So maybe I did something wrong here.\n\nWait, this is a contradiction. Because if the GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11. But 350 is not a multiple of 11. Hmm, that can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe the formula is correct, but I have to make sure that the numbers are correct. Let me check 350. 350 divided by 11 is approximately 31.81, which isn't an integer. So 350 isn't a multiple of 11. So that's a problem because if the GCF is 11, both numbers must be divisible by 11. So that suggests that either the problem is wrong, or I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, the problem states that the GCF is 11, and one of the numbers is 350. But 350 isn't a multiple of 11. That can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in applying the formula.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the formula. I think the formula is correct: product of the two numbers equals GCF times LCM. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me recalculate 11 *7700. 7700 *11: 7000*11 is 77,000, 700*11 is 7,700. So 77,000 + 7,700 = 84,700. So 350 * x =84,700. So x=84700/350.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute 84700 divided by 350. Let me try that. 350 goes into 84700 how many times? Let's see: 350 * 240 is 84,000. Then 84,700 -84,000 is 700. 700 divided by 350 is 2. So 240 +2 =242. So x is 242. But 242 divided by 11 is 22, because 11*22=242. So 242 is a multiple of 11, but 350 isn't. So that's a problem because their GCF is 11, which implies both should be multiples of 11.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the product is GCF * LCM. Wait, let me confirm the formula. Oh wait! The formula is correct when the two numbers are a and b: a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So if that's the case, then the product should be 11 * 7700 = 84700. So 350 * x =84700. So x=242. But then, why is 350 not a multiple of 11? That's the issue.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is correct, but maybe I made a mistake in thinking that the GCF must be a factor of both numbers. Oh wait, that's a fundamental concept. The GCF is the greatest common divisor, so it must divide both numbers. So if 350 is not a multiple of 11, then the GCF can't be 11. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem, but I must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating 350's divisibility by 11. Let me check again. 350 divided by 11. Let's compute 11*31 is 341. 350 -341 is 9, so no, 350 is not divisible by 11. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait a second, maybe I should think differently. Perhaps the problem is correct, and I'm missing a step. Because according to the problem, the GCF is 11, but 350 isn't a multiple of 11. So that's a contradiction. So perhaps I should look for another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should express both numbers in terms of their prime factors. Since the GCF is 11, which is a prime number, both numbers must have 11 as a factor. So 350 must be expressed as 11 times something, but wait, 350 divided by 11 isn't an integer. So that suggests that the problem is incorrect, but that's not an option here. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is different. Oh wait, perhaps I mixed up GCF and LCM. Let me think again. Oh no, the formula is correct. So perhaps the problem has a typo, but since this is a problem given to me, I have to proceed.\n\nWait, another approach. Let me compute 350 and x. Since GCF is 11, perhaps 350 is 11 times some number, but 350/11 is about 31.818, which is not an integer. So that's a problem. So maybe the other number is 242, which is 11*22. So 350 and 242.\n\nLet me compute their GCF. Hmm, to find the GCF of 350 and 242.\n\nLet me factor both:\n\n350: 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242: 2 * 11^2. Wait, 242 is 2 * 11 * 11.\n\nWait, wait, 242 divided by 2 is 121, which is 11 squared. So 242 = 2 * 11^2.\n\n350: 2 *5^2 *7.\n\nSo the common factors are 2 and 11? Wait, no, 350 has 2 and 5 and 7; 242 has 2 and 11. So the common factors are just 2. So the GCF of 350 and 242 would be 2, not 11. That's a problem because the problem states the GCF is 11. So that suggests that 242 isn't the correct answer.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, the product is 84700, so x must be 242. But that leads to a contradiction in the GCF. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the fact that the GCF is 11, so both numbers must be multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11, but it's not. So that suggests that perhaps the problem is wrong, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the other options. Maybe the correct answer is another option, and I made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nLet me check each option:\n\nOption A:242. As above, 242 is 2*11^2. 350 is 2*5^2*7. So GCF is 2, which doesn't match.\n\nOption B:308. Let me factor 308. 308 divided by 2 is 154. Divided by 2 again is 77. 77 is 7*11. So 308= 2^2 *7 *11.\n\n350=2*5^2*7.\n\nSo the common factors are 2 and 7. So GCF is 2*7=14. But the problem says GCF is 11, so that's not correct.\n\nOption C:352. Let's factor 352. 352 /2=176, /2=88, /2=44, /2=22, /2=11. So 352=2^5 *11.\n\n350=2*5^2*7.\n\nCommon factors are 2. So GCF is 2. Not 11.\n\nOption D:412. Let's factor 412. 412 divided by 2 is 206, divided by 2 is 103. 103 is a prime. So 412=2^2 *103.\n\n350=2 *5^2 *7. So common factor is 2. So GCF is 2, not 11.\n\nOption E:456. Factor 456: 456/2=228, /2=114, /2=57. 57 is 3*19. So 456=2^3 *3 *19.\n\n350=2*5^2 *7. Common factor is 2. So GCF is 2, not 11.\n\nWait a minute, none of the options give a GCF of 11 when paired with 350. That's a problem. So what's going on here?\n\nWait, but according to the formula, the product is 350 * x = 11 *7700=84700. So x=242, which is option A. But that gives a GCF of 2, not 11. So that suggests that the problem is wrong, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. Maybe the GCF is 11, which is a prime. So both numbers must be multiples of 11. But 350 isn't a multiple of 11. So that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says the GCF is 11, but one number is 350, which isn't a multiple of 11. So that can't be. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). But wait, is that correct? Let me confirm.\n\nYes, I'm pretty sure that's the formula. For any two positive integers a and b, GCD(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a*b.\n\nSo according to that, if 350 is one number, the other number x is 84700/350=242. But 242 and 350 have a GCD of 2, not 11. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, unless I'm making a mistake in calculating the GCD. Let me recheck.\n\n350 and 242.\n\n350: 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242: 2 *11^2.\n\nSo the only common prime factor is 2, so GCD is 2. So the problem's statement that the GCF is 11 is wrong. So that's a problem.\n\nSo this suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Or perhaps the problem has a typo. But in any case, the correct answer according to the formula is 242, which is option A, but that doesn't fit with the GCF being 11.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is correct, and I'm making a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me suppose that the two numbers are 350 and x. Their GCF is 11, and LCM is 7700.\n\nSo since GCF is 11, both numbers can be expressed as 11*a and 11*b, where a and b are integers with GCF 1.\n\nBecause if the GCF is 11, then the numbers can be written as 11 times two co-prime numbers.\n\nSo 350 must be 11*a, but 350 divided by 11 is not an integer. So that's a problem. So perhaps 350 isn't a multiple of 11, which contradicts the GCF being 11.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is incorrect. But that's not helpful here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the LCM of 350 and x, given that their GCF is 11.\n\nThe formula for LCM(a,b) = (a*b) / GCF(a,b). So LCM(350, x) = (350*x)/11 = 7700.\n\nSo (350 *x)/11 =7700 \u2192 350x =7700 *11 \u2192 350x=84700 \u2192x=84700/350=242.\n\nBut as before, 242 and 350 have a GCF of 2, not 11.\n\nSo this suggests that the problem's data is inconsistent. But perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps I should check the problem statement again. It says the GCF is 11. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the fact that if GCF(a,b)=g, then a= g*m and b=g*n, where m and n are co-prime.\n\nSo in this case, a=350, g=11, so 350=11*m \u2192 m=350/11, which is not an integer. So that's impossible. Therefore, the problem as stated is impossible.\n\nBut the problem gives options, so perhaps I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says that the LCM is 7700 and the GCF is 11. But 350 and x must both be multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11. Let me check: 350 divided by 11 is 31.818..., which isn't an integer. So that's a problem.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but since I have to choose from the options, perhaps I should reevaluate.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute 350 * x = 11 *7700.\n\n11 *7700 is 84700. So 350 *x =84700 \u2192 x=84700/350.\n\nLet me compute 84700 divided by 350. Let's see, 350 *242 = 84700. So x is 242.\n\nBut that brings us back to the same issue: 242 and 350 have GCF 2, not 11.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is wrong, but perhaps the intended answer is 242, option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended the LCM to be 7700 and GCF 14, but that's not what's stated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if 350 and 242 have an LCM of 7700.\n\nCompute LCM(350,242). Let's find it.\n\nFirst, factor both:\n\n350=2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242=2 *11^2.\n\nSo the LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes present. So primes are 2,5,7,11.\n\nSo LCM is 2^1 *5^2 *7^1 *11^2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n2=2.\n\n5^2=25.\n\n7=7.\n\n11^2=121.\n\nMultiply all together: 2 *25=50; 50 *7=350; 350 *121.\n\n350 *120=42,000; 350*1=350 \u2192 42,000 +350=42,350.\n\nBut the problem states the LCM is 7700. So 42,350 is not equal to 7700. So that's another problem.\n\nSo according to the formula, the product is 350*242=84,700. The product of GCF (11) and LCM (7700) is 84,700. So the formula holds, but the LCM is wrong in this case.\n\nWait, that's confusing. So according to the formula, the product is correct, but the LCM isn't matching. So that suggests that the problem is impossible as stated.\n\nBut perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me compute the LCM of 350 and 242 again.\n\n350=2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242=2 *11^2.\n\nSo LCM is 2 *5^2 *7 *11^2.\n\nWhich is 2 *25 *7 *121.\n\n2*25=50; 50*7=350; 350 *121=42,350. So LCM is 42,350, which doesn't match the given 7700.\n\nSo that's another contradiction. Therefore, the problem as stated is impossible.\n\nBut perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the formula gives x=242, which is option A, even though it doesn't fit the GCF condition. But that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should re-examine the problem. Oh wait, the problem says the GCF is 11, and one number is 350. So if 350 isn't a multiple of 11, perhaps the other number is a multiple of 11, but that's not sufficient for the GCF to be 11.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the problem differently. Maybe I'm using the wrong formula.\n\nWait, another approach: the GCF of two numbers is the product of the smallest powers of the common primes in their factorizations. So if 350 is one number, which is 2 *5^2 *7, and the GCF is 11, which is a prime, then both numbers must have 11 as a factor. But 350 doesn't. So that's impossible. So the problem is impossible.\n\nBut since the problem gives options, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 14. Because 350 is a multiple of 14, but that's a guess.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the possible options again.\n\nLet me compute the GCF of each option with 350, and see which one has a GCF of 11.\n\nOption A:242. 350 and 242.\n\n350: 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242:2 *11^2.\n\nCommon factors: 2. So GCF is 2.\n\nOption B:308. 308=2^2 *7 *11.\n\n350=2 *5^2 *7.\n\nCommon factors: 2 and 7. So GCF is 2*7=14.\n\nOption C:352. 352=2^5 *11.\n\n350:2 *5^2 *7.\n\nCommon factor:2. GCF=2.\n\nOption D:412. 412=2^2 *103.\n\n350:2 *5^2 *7.\n\nCommon factor:2. GCF=2.\n\nOption E:456. 456=2^3 *3 *19.\n\n350:2 *5^2 *7.\n\nCommon factor:2. GCF=2.\n\nSo none of the options give a GCF of 11 when paired with 350. So the problem as stated is impossible. But since I have to choose an answer, perhaps the intended answer is 242, option A, despite the inconsistency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Let me recheck that.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So 350 * x =11 *7700=84700. So x=242. But the GCF of 350 and 242 is 2, not 11. So that's a problem.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is incorrect, but the intended answer is A)242.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves finding the other integer when one integer is 350, the greatest common factor (GCF) is 11, and the least common multiple (LCM) is 7700. The relationship between GCF and LCM is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\na \\times b = \\text{GCF}(a, b) \\times \\text{LCM}(a, b)\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(a = 350\\), \\(\\text{GCF}(a, b) = 11\\), and \\(\\text{LCM}(a, b) = 7700\\). Substituting these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n350 \\times b = 11 \\times 7700\n\\]\n\nCalculating the right-hand side:\n\n\\[\n11 \\times 7700 = 84700\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\n350 \\times b = 84700 \\implies b = \\frac{84700}{350} = 242\n\\]\n\nThe other integer is therefore \\(b = 242\\). However, there is a contradiction: the GCF of 350 and 242 must be 11, as stated in the problem. To verify this, factorize both numbers:\n\n- \\(350 = 2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7\\)\n- \\(242 = 2 \\times 11^2\\)\n\nThe only common prime factor is \\(2\\), so the GCF of 350 and 242 is \\(2\\), not \\(11\\). This inconsistency suggests the problem's conditions are contradictory. Nevertheless, based on the formula and the given options, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: A**",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about the greatest common factor and least common multiple of two numbers. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I remember that when dealing with GCF and LCM, there's a formula that connects them. Oh right, the product of the two numbers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM. So if I have two numbers, say a and b, then a * b = GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b). \n\nThe problem says the GCF is 11, and the LCM is 7700. One of the numbers is 350, and I need to find the other number. Let me denote the numbers as 350 and x, where x is the unknown.\n\nSo according to the formula, 350 * x = 11 * 7700. Let me compute that right-hand side first. 11 multiplied by 7700. Let's see, 7700 times 10 is 77000, so 7700 * 11 is 77000 + 7700 = 84700. So 350 * x = 84700.\n\nWait, so to find x, I can divide 84700 by 350. Let me do that calculation. Hmm, 350 times 240 is 84,000 because 350 * 200 is 70,000 and 350 * 40 is 14,000. Adding those gives 84,000. Then 84,700 minus 84,000 is 700. So 700 divided by 350 is 2. So x should be 240 + 2 = 242? Wait, but wait, 350 times 242 would be 350*(200 + 40 + 2) = 350*200=70,000; 350*40=14,000; 350*2=700. Adding those gives 70,000 +14,000=84,000 +700=84,700. Oh yes, that's correct. So x would be 242.\n\nWait a minute, but looking at the options, A is 242. But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Because sometimes when I'm working quickly, I might miscalculate. Let me double-check the formula. Yeah, a * b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So 350 * x = 11 * 7700.\n\nWait, 11 *7700 is 84700. 84700 divided by 350. Let me compute 350 into 84700. 350 times 240 is 84000. 84700 minus 84000 is 700. 700 divided by 350 is 2. So 240 + 2 =242. Yep, that's right.\n\nBut wait, another thought: the GCF is 11, which means both numbers must be multiples of 11. Let's check if 350 is a multiple of 11. 350 divided by 11. 11*31 is 341, 350-341=9, so no, 350 isn't a multiple of 11. Oh wait, that's a problem. Because if the GCF is 11, both numbers should be divisible by 11. So maybe I did something wrong here.\n\nWait, this is a contradiction. Because if the GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11. But 350 is not a multiple of 11. Hmm, that can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe the formula is correct, but I have to make sure that the numbers are correct. Let me check 350. 350 divided by 11 is approximately 31.81, which isn't an integer. So 350 isn't a multiple of 11. So that's a problem because if the GCF is 11, both numbers must be divisible by 11. So that suggests that either the problem is wrong, or I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, the problem states that the GCF is 11, and one of the numbers is 350. But 350 isn't a multiple of 11. That can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in applying the formula.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the formula. I think the formula is correct: product of the two numbers equals GCF times LCM. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me recalculate 11 *7700. 7700 *11: 7000*11 is 77,000, 700*11 is 7,700. So 77,000 + 7,700 = 84,700. So 350 * x =84,700. So x=84700/350.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute 84700 divided by 350. Let me try that. 350 goes into 84700 how many times? Let's see: 350 * 240 is 84,000. Then 84,700 -84,000 is 700. 700 divided by 350 is 2. So 240 +2 =242. So x is 242. But 242 divided by 11 is 22, because 11*22=242. So 242 is a multiple of 11, but 350 isn't. So that's a problem because their GCF is 11, which implies both should be multiples of 11.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the product is GCF * LCM. Wait, let me confirm the formula. Oh wait! The formula is correct when the two numbers are a and b: a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So if that's the case, then the product should be 11 * 7700 = 84700. So 350 * x =84700. So x=242. But then, why is 350 not a multiple of 11? That's the issue.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is correct, but maybe I made a mistake in thinking that the GCF must be a factor of both numbers. Oh wait, that's a fundamental concept. The GCF is the greatest common divisor, so it must divide both numbers. So if 350 is not a multiple of 11, then the GCF can't be 11. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem, but I must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating 350's divisibility by 11. Let me check again. 350 divided by 11. Let's compute 11*31 is 341. 350 -341 is 9, so no, 350 is not divisible by 11. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait a second, maybe I should think differently. Perhaps the problem is correct, and I'm missing a step. Because according to the problem, the GCF is 11, but 350 isn't a multiple of 11. So that's a contradiction. So perhaps I should look for another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should express both numbers in terms of their prime factors. Since the GCF is 11, which is a prime number, both numbers must have 11 as a factor. So 350 must be expressed as 11 times something, but wait, 350 divided by 11 isn't an integer. So that suggests that the problem is incorrect, but that's not an option here. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is different. Oh wait, perhaps I mixed up GCF and LCM. Let me think again. Oh no, the formula is correct. So perhaps the problem has a typo, but since this is a problem given to me, I have to proceed.\n\nWait, another approach. Let me compute 350 and x. Since GCF is 11, perhaps 350 is 11 times some number, but 350/11 is about 31.818, which is not an integer. So that's a problem. So maybe the other number is 242, which is 11*22. So 350 and 242.\n\nLet me compute their GCF. Hmm, to find the GCF of 350 and 242.\n\nLet me factor both:\n\n350: 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242: 2 * 11^2. Wait, 242 is 2 * 11 * 11.\n\nWait, wait, 242 divided by 2 is 121, which is 11 squared. So 242 = 2 * 11^2.\n\n350: 2 *5^2 *7.\n\nSo the common factors are 2 and 11? Wait, no, 350 has 2 and 5 and 7; 242 has 2 and 11. So the common factors are just 2. So the GCF of 350 and 242 would be 2, not 11. That's a problem because the problem states the GCF is 11. So that suggests that 242 isn't the correct answer.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, the product is 84700, so x must be 242. But that leads to a contradiction in the GCF. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the fact that the GCF is 11, so both numbers must be multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11, but it's not. So that suggests that perhaps the problem is wrong, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the other options. Maybe the correct answer is another option, and I made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nLet me check each option:\n\nOption A:242. As above, 242 is 2*11^2. 350 is 2*5^2*7. So GCF is 2, which doesn't match.\n\nOption B:308. Let me factor 308. 308 divided by 2 is 154. Divided by 2 again is 77. 77 is 7*11. So 308= 2^2 *7 *11.\n\n350=2*5^2*7.\n\nSo the common factors are 2 and 7. So GCF is 2*7=14. But the problem says GCF is 11, so that's not correct.\n\nOption C:352. Let's factor 352. 352 /2=176, /2=88, /2=44, /2=22, /2=11. So 352=2^5 *11.\n\n350=2*5^2*7.\n\nCommon factors are 2. So GCF is 2. Not 11.\n\nOption D:412. Let's factor 412. 412 divided by 2 is 206, divided by 2 is 103. 103 is a prime. So 412=2^2 *103.\n\n350=2 *5^2 *7. So common factor is 2. So GCF is 2, not 11.\n\nOption E:456. Factor 456: 456/2=228, /2=114, /2=57. 57 is 3*19. So 456=2^3 *3 *19.\n\n350=2*5^2 *7. Common factor is 2. So GCF is 2, not 11.\n\nWait a minute, none of the options give a GCF of 11 when paired with 350. That's a problem. So what's going on here?\n\nWait, but according to the formula, the product is 350 * x = 11 *7700=84700. So x=242, which is option A. But that gives a GCF of 2, not 11. So that suggests that the problem is wrong, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. Maybe the GCF is 11, which is a prime. So both numbers must be multiples of 11. But 350 isn't a multiple of 11. So that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says the GCF is 11, but one number is 350, which isn't a multiple of 11. So that can't be. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). But wait, is that correct? Let me confirm.\n\nYes, I'm pretty sure that's the formula. For any two positive integers a and b, GCD(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a*b.\n\nSo according to that, if 350 is one number, the other number x is 84700/350=242. But 242 and 350 have a GCD of 2, not 11. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, unless I'm making a mistake in calculating the GCD. Let me recheck.\n\n350 and 242.\n\n350: 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242: 2 *11^2.\n\nSo the only common prime factor is 2, so GCD is 2. So the problem's statement that the GCF is 11 is wrong. So that's a problem.\n\nSo this suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Or perhaps the problem has a typo. But in any case, the correct answer according to the formula is 242, which is option A, but that doesn't fit with the GCF being 11.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is correct, and I'm making a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me suppose that the two numbers are 350 and x. Their GCF is 11, and LCM is 7700.\n\nSo since GCF is 11, both numbers can be expressed as 11*a and 11*b, where a and b are integers with GCF 1.\n\nBecause if the GCF is 11, then the numbers can be written as 11 times two co-prime numbers.\n\nSo 350 must be 11*a, but 350 divided by 11 is not an integer. So that's a problem. So perhaps 350 isn't a multiple of 11, which contradicts the GCF being 11.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is incorrect. But that's not helpful here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the LCM of 350 and x, given that their GCF is 11.\n\nThe formula for LCM(a,b) = (a*b) / GCF(a,b). So LCM(350, x) = (350*x)/11 = 7700.\n\nSo (350 *x)/11 =7700 \u2192 350x =7700 *11 \u2192 350x=84700 \u2192x=84700/350=242.\n\nBut as before, 242 and 350 have a GCF of 2, not 11.\n\nSo this suggests that the problem's data is inconsistent. But perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps I should check the problem statement again. It says the GCF is 11. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the fact that if GCF(a,b)=g, then a= g*m and b=g*n, where m and n are co-prime.\n\nSo in this case, a=350, g=11, so 350=11*m \u2192 m=350/11, which is not an integer. So that's impossible. Therefore, the problem as stated is impossible.\n\nBut the problem gives options, so perhaps I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says that the LCM is 7700 and the GCF is 11. But 350 and x must both be multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11. Let me check: 350 divided by 11 is 31.818..., which isn't an integer. So that's a problem.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but since I have to choose from the options, perhaps I should reevaluate.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute 350 * x = 11 *7700.\n\n11 *7700 is 84700. So 350 *x =84700 \u2192 x=84700/350.\n\nLet me compute 84700 divided by 350. Let's see, 350 *242 = 84700. So x is 242.\n\nBut that brings us back to the same issue: 242 and 350 have GCF 2, not 11.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is wrong, but perhaps the intended answer is 242, option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended the LCM to be 7700 and GCF 14, but that's not what's stated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if 350 and 242 have an LCM of 7700.\n\nCompute LCM(350,242). Let's find it.\n\nFirst, factor both:\n\n350=2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242=2 *11^2.\n\nSo the LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes present. So primes are 2,5,7,11.\n\nSo LCM is 2^1 *5^2 *7^1 *11^2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n2=2.\n\n5^2=25.\n\n7=7.\n\n11^2=121.\n\nMultiply all together: 2 *25=50; 50 *7=350; 350 *121.\n\n350 *120=42,000; 350*1=350 \u2192 42,000 +350=42,350.\n\nBut the problem states the LCM is 7700. So 42,350 is not equal to 7700. So that's another problem.\n\nSo according to the formula, the product is 350*242=84,700. The product of GCF (11) and LCM (7700) is 84,700. So the formula holds, but the LCM is wrong in this case.\n\nWait, that's confusing. So according to the formula, the product is correct, but the LCM isn't matching. So that suggests that the problem is impossible as stated.\n\nBut perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me compute the LCM of 350 and 242 again.\n\n350=2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242=2 *11^2.\n\nSo LCM is 2 *5^2 *7 *11^2.\n\nWhich is 2 *25 *7 *121.\n\n2*25=50; 50*7=350; 350 *121=42,350. So LCM is 42,350, which doesn't match the given 7700.\n\nSo that's another contradiction. Therefore, the problem as stated is impossible.\n\nBut perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the formula gives x=242, which is option A, even though it doesn't fit the GCF condition. But that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should re-examine the problem. Oh wait, the problem says the GCF is 11, and one number is 350. So if 350 isn't a multiple of 11, perhaps the other number is a multiple of 11, but that's not sufficient for the GCF to be 11.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the problem differently. Maybe I'm using the wrong formula.\n\nWait, another approach: the GCF of two numbers is the product of the smallest powers of the common primes in their factorizations. So if 350 is one number, which is 2 *5^2 *7, and the GCF is 11, which is a prime, then both numbers must have 11 as a factor. But 350 doesn't. So that's impossible. So the problem is impossible.\n\nBut since the problem gives options, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 14. Because 350 is a multiple of 14, but that's a guess.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the possible options again.\n\nLet me compute the GCF of each option with 350, and see which one has a GCF of 11.\n\nOption A:242. 350 and 242.\n\n350: 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242:2 *11^2.\n\nCommon factors: 2. So GCF is 2.\n\nOption B:308. 308=2^2 *7 *11.\n\n350=2 *5^2 *7.\n\nCommon factors: 2 and 7. So GCF is 2*7=14.\n\nOption C:352. 352=2^5 *11.\n\n350:2 *5^2 *7.\n\nCommon factor:2. GCF=2.\n\nOption D:412. 412=2^2 *103.\n\n350:2 *5^2 *7.\n\nCommon factor:2. GCF=2.\n\nOption E:456. 456=2^3 *3 *19.\n\n350:2 *5^2 *7.\n\nCommon factor:2. GCF=2.\n\nSo none of the options give a GCF of 11 when paired with 350. So the problem as stated is impossible. But since I have to choose an answer, perhaps the intended answer is 242, option A, despite the inconsistency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Let me recheck that.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So 350 * x =11 *7700=84700. So x=242. But the GCF of 350 and 242 is 2, not 11. So that's a problem.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is incorrect, but the intended answer is A)242.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the other integer when one integer is 350, the greatest common factor (GCF) is 11, and the least common multiple (LCM) is 7700. The relationship between GCF and LCM is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\na \\times b = \\text{GCF}(a, b) \\times \\text{LCM}(a, b)\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(a = 350\\), \\(\\text{GCF}(a, b) = 11\\), and \\(\\text{LCM}(a, b) = 7700\\). Substituting these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n350 \\times b = 11 \\times 7700\n\\]\n\nCalculating the right-hand side:\n\n\\[\n11 \\times 7700 = 84700\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\n350 \\times b = 84700 \\implies b = \\frac{84700}{350} = 242\n\\]\n\nThe other integer is therefore \\(b = 242\\). However, there is a contradiction: the GCF of 350 and 242 must be 11, as stated in the problem. To verify this, factorize both numbers:\n\n- \\(350 = 2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7\\)\n- \\(242 = 2 \\times 11^2\\)\n\nThe only common prime factor is \\(2\\), so the GCF of 350 and 242 is \\(2\\), not \\(11\\). This inconsistency suggests the problem's conditions are contradictory. Nevertheless, based on the formula and the given options, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: A**",
