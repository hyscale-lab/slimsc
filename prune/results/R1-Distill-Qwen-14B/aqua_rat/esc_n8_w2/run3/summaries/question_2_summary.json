      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem about the original price of an item. Let me read the question carefully again.\n\nAlright, the original price is discounted by 22%. Then a customer buys it using a $20-off coupon. There's no tax, and this was the only item bought. The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price. I need to find the original price.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. Let's denote the original price as P. \n\nFirst, the item is discounted by 22%. So the discounted price would be P minus 22% of P, which is 0.22P. So the discounted price is 0.78P. Alternatively, I can think of it as the customer paying 78% of the original price because 100% -22% =78%.\n\nWait, but then the customer uses a $20-off coupon. So the final price paid is the discounted price minus $20. So final price = 0.78P - 20.\n\nThe problem states that this final price is $1.90 more than half the original price. Half of the original price is (1/2)P or 0.5P. So, final price equals 0.5P + 1.90.\n\nPutting it together: 0.78P -20 = 0.5P + 1.90.\n\nNow I can set up the equation and solve for P.\n\nLet me write that equation again:\n0.78P - 20 = 0.5P + 1.90\n\nI'll subtract 0.5P from both sides to get the terms involving P on one side.\n0.78P - 0.5P - 20 = 1.90\nWhich simplifies to 0.28P -20 = 1.90.\n\nNext, I'll add 20 to both sides to isolate the term with P.\n0.28P = 1.90 + 20\n0.28P = 21.90\n\nNow, solve for P by dividing both sides by 0.28.\nP = 21.90 / 0.28\n\nHmm, let me calculate that. 21.90 divided by 0.28.\n\nLet me think: 0.28 is the same as 28/100 or 7/25. So dividing by 0.28 is the same as multiplying by 100/28.\n\n21.90 * (100/28) = ?\n\nWait, maybe I can compute it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, 21.90 \u00f7 0.28.\n\nI can think of this as 2190 \u00f7 28.\n\nWait, because 21.90 is 2190 cents, and 0.28 is 28 cents. So 2190 \u00f7 28.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n28 times 78 is 2184 because 28*70=1960, 28*8=224, so 1960+224=2184. \n\n2190 - 2184 is 6. So 28*78=2184, so 2190 is 78 with a remainder of 6, so 6/28 is 0.214285...\n\nSo 78.214285... So P is approximately 78.214.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is $78.20, which is close. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA) 61\nB) 65\nC)67.40\nD)70\nE)78.20\n\nWait, my calculation gives P \u224878.21. So the closest option is E, 78.20.\n\nBut let me double-check my equation to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nThe customer paid 0.78P -20, which is equal to 0.5P +1.90.\n\nSo 0.78P -20 =0.5P +1.90.\n\nSubtract 0.5P: 0.28P -20 =1.90.\n\nAdd 20: 0.28P=21.90.\n\nP=21.90/0.28=78.214285...\n\nSo yes, approximately 78.21. The options have E)78.20, which is very close. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me plug E into the original equation to make sure.\n\nOriginal price P =78.20.\n\n22% discount: 78.20 * 0.22 = 17.204. So discounted price is 78.20 -17.204=60.996, which is about $61.00.\n\nThen subtract $20 coupon: 61.00 -20=41.00.\n\nNow, half the original price is 78.20/2=39.10. Then, 39.10 +1.90=41.00.\n\nWhich matches the final price paid. So yes, it's correct.\n\nSo the original price is approximately $78.20, which is option E.\n",

Alternatively, I could think of it as 78% of P because 100% minus 22% is 78%. So, the discounted price is 0.78 * P.\n\nThen, the customer uses a $20-off coupon. So, they subtract another $20 from that discounted price. So the price the customer pays is (0.78 * P) minus 20.\n\nWait, and the problem says that this amount the customer paid is $1.90 more than half the original price. Oh, right. So half the original price is (P/2). So the equation would be:\n\n(0.78P - 20) = (P/2) + 1.90\n\nHmm, okay. Let me write that equation down properly. So:\n\n0.78P - 20 = 0.5P + 1.90\n\nNow, I need to solve for P. Let's subtract 0.5P from both sides to get the P terms together.\n\n0.78P - 0.5P - 20 = 1.90\nWhich simplifies to 0.28P -20 = 1.90\n\nNow, I'll add 20 to both sides to isolate the term with P.\n\n0.28P = 1.90 + 20\n0.28P = 21.90\n\nThen, I divide both sides by 0.28 to find P.\n\nP = 21.90 / 0.28\n\nLet me calculate that. Hmm, 21.90 divided by 0.28. Let me think. 0.28 times 78 is 21.84, because 0.28 * 70 is 19.6, and 0.28 * 8 is 2.24, so 19.6 + 2.24 = 21.84. So 78 would give 21.84, which is just 0.06 less than 21.90. So, 78 plus (0.06 / 0.28) is approximately 78 + 0.214 \u2248 78.214. Wait, but let me do the exact calculation.\n\nWait, 21.90 divided by 0.28. Let me convert 0.28 to a fraction. 0.28 is 28/100, which is 7/25. So, dividing by 7/25 is the same as multiplying by 25/7.\n\nSo, 21.90 * (25/7) = ?\n\nLet me compute 21.90 /7 first. 7 goes into 21 three times, so 3. 0.90 divided by 7 is approximately 0.1286. So 21.90 /7 \u2248 3.12857.\n\nThen multiply by 25: 3.12857 *25. Let's see, 3*25=75, 0.12857 *25 \u2248 3.214. So total is about 78.214.\n\nWait, but 0.28 times 78 is 21.84. 78.214 times 0.28 would be 78 *0.28 = 21.84, plus 0.214 *0.28 \u2248 0.0599. So 21.84 +0.0599 \u224821.8999, which is about 21.90. So P is approximately 78.214.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is $78.20, which is very close. So that's probably the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the equation to make sure I didn't set it up wrong. The customer paid (0.78P -20), which is equal to (P/2 +1.90). Yes, that's correct according to the problem statement.\n\nWait another thing: when you subtract 20 from 0.78P, that's the price after discount and coupon. And that equals half the original price plus 1.90.\n\nYes, that makes sense.

Hmm, 21.90 divided by 0.28. Let me think. 0.28 times 78 is 21.84, because 0.28 * 70 is 19.6, and 0.28 * 8 is 2.24, so 19.6 + 2.24 = 21.84. So 78 would give 21.84, which is just 0.06 less than 21.90.

Let me convert 0.28 to a fraction. 0.28 is 28/100, which is 7/25. So, dividing by 7/25 is the same as multiplying by 25/7.\n\nSo, 21.90 * (25/7) = ?\n\nLet me compute 21.90 /7 first. 7 goes into 21 three times, so 3. 0.90 divided by 7 is approximately 0.1286.
