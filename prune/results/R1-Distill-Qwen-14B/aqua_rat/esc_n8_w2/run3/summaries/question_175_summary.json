      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about cutting a rope into two pieces. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The rope is 20 meters long, and it's cut into two pieces. One piece is 3 meters shorter than the other. I need to find the length of the longer piece.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. So, the total length is 20 meters. Let me think about how to model this. Maybe using variables would help. Let's say the longer piece has a length of x meters. Then the shorter piece would be x minus 3 meters because it's 3 meters shorter. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, if the longer is x, then the shorter is x minus 3? Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, no. Wait, if the longer piece is x, then the shorter is x minus 3. Because if the longer is, say, 10, the shorter would be 7. So yeah, that makes sense. So the two pieces are x and x-3.\n\nBut wait, wait, the sum of the two pieces should be 20 meters, right? Because the whole rope is 20. So x plus (x-3) equals 20. Let me write that equation down. \n\nx + (x -3) = 20.\n\nWait, combining like terms: 2x -3 = 20. Then, adding 3 to both sides gives 2x =23. So x is 23 divided by 2. Let me do that division. 23 divided by 2 is 11.5. So x is 11.5 meters. That's the longer piece.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If the longer is 11.5, then the shorter is 11.5 -3 = 8.5. Let me add them: 11.5 +8.5=20. Yep, that works.\n\nSo looking at the options, option D is 11.5. So that should be the answer.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, let the length of the longer piece be \\( x \\) meters.
