      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about the cost of soda bottles. Hmm, let's see. The question is: If 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, how much will B bottles cost in dollars? And there are five options to choose from.\n\nAlright, first, I need to figure out the cost per bottle and then apply that to B bottles. But wait, the units are in cents and dollars, so I have to convert properly.\n\nSo, 27 bottles cost A cents. That means each bottle costs A divided by 27 cents. Let me write that down: cost per bottle is A / 27 cents.\n\nNow, I need to find the cost for B bottles. So multiply the per bottle cost by B. That gives (A/27) * B cents. But wait, the answer needs to be in dollars, not cents.\n\nSince 1 dollar is 100 cents, I need to convert cents to dollars by dividing by 100. So the total cost in dollars would be (A * B) / 27 / 100. Which can be written as (A * B) / (27 * 100) = AB / 2700 dollars.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is AB/2700. That seems to fit. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, another way to approach it: Maybe set up a proportion. If 27 bottles are A cents, then 1 bottle is A/27 cents. B bottles would be B*(A/27) cents. To get dollars, divide by 100, so (AB/27)/100 = AB/(27*100) = AB/2700. Yep, same answer.\n\nLooking at the options again, option A is AB/2700. So that's the correct choice.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about the cost of soda bottles. Let me try to break it down. The question says that 27 bottles cost A cents, and I need to find out how much B bottles would cost in dollars. Hmm, right. I'm a bit rusty on unit conversions, but let's see.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out the cost per bottle in cents. If 27 bottles are A cents, then one bottle would be A divided by 27 cents. So, the cost per bottle is A/27 cents. Got it.\n\nNow, the question is about B bottles. So I need to multiply the per-bottle cost by B. That would be (A/27) * B cents. Oh wait, but the question asks for the cost in dollars. Oh right, because dollars and cents are different. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so I need to convert the total cents into dollars.\n\nSo, the total cost in cents is (A*B)/27. To get dollars, I divide that by 100. So, (A*B)/(27*100) dollars. Let me write that as (AB)/(2700). Oh, wait, because 27 times 100 is 2700. So the formula is AB divided by 2700.\n\nNow looking at the options, I see option A is AB/2700. That seems to match. But wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix anything up.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think in terms of proportions. If 27 bottles cost A cents, then 1 bottle is A/27 cents. So B bottles would cost (B * (A/27)) cents. To convert to dollars, divide by 100. So (AB)/(27*100) = AB/2700. Yep, that's the same as before. So the answer should be option A.\n\nWait, let me look at the options again. Option A is AB/2700. Option E is 100AB/27. Hmm, that would be if I multiplied by 100 instead of dividing. So that would be incorrect because I need to convert cents to dollars, which is division by 100. So definitely, A is correct.\n\nI think that's solid. So the correct answer should be option A.\n",
