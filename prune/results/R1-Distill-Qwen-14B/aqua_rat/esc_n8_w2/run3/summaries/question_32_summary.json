      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about maps and distances. Hmm, let me see. The question says that on a map, the road from Town F to Town G is 20 inches long. And then it says that 1/4 inch on the map represents 10 miles in real life. I need to find the actual distance between the two towns. \n\nWait, right, this is a scale conversion problem. I remember that scale maps use a certain length to represent actual distances. So I think I need to figure out how many miles each inch on the map corresponds to and then multiply that by 20 inches.\n\nLet me break it down. The scale given is 1/4 inch equals 10 miles. So first, maybe I should find out how many miles one inch equals. Since 1/4 inch is 10 miles, then one inch would be four times that, right? Because 1 divided by 1/4 is 4. So 10 miles multiplied by 4 would be 40 miles per inch.\n\nWait, wait, let me double-check that. If 1/4 inch is 10 miles, then for one inch, which is four times longer, the distance should be four times 10 miles. So yeah, 10 *4 =40. So each inch equals 40 miles.\n\nNow, the distance on the map is 20 inches. So the actual distance would be 20 inches multiplied by 40 miles per inch. Let me calculate that. 20 *40 is 800. So 800 miles? Hmm, but wait, I should make sure I didn't mix up the scale.\n\nWait another thought: Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the ratio. The scale is 1/4 inch to 10 miles. So, for each inch, it's 40 miles as I found before. So 20 inches would be 20 *40 =800. That's what I get.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 800. So that should be the correct answer.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by understanding the scale of the map. The scale indicates that 1/4 inch on the map corresponds to 10 miles in reality. To find how many miles one inch represents, we multiply 10 miles by 4 (since 1 inch = 4 * 1/4 inch). This gives:\n\n\\[\n1 \\text{ inch} = 40 \\text{ miles}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the actual distance for 20 inches on the map. Since 1 inch corresponds to 40 miles, multiplying 20 inches by 40 miles per inch gives:\n\n\\[\n20 \\text{ inches} \\times 40 \\text{ miles/inch} = 800 \\text{ miles}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the actual distance from Town F to Town G is 800 miles. Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: A",

So, if 1/4 inch equals 10 miles, I can probably set up a proportion or just calculate how many such units are in 20 inches.\n\nWait, maybe I should start by figuring out how many 1/4 inches are there in 20 inches. Because each 1/4 inch equals 10 miles. So, if I can find out how many quarter inches make up the 20 inches, I can multiply that by 10 miles to get the total distance.\n\nLet me think: 1 inch is equal to 4 quarters (since 1/4 inch is a quarter). So, 20 inches would be 20 times 4, which is 80. So, 80 units of 1/4 inch. Each of those units is 10 miles, so 80 times 10 equals 800 miles.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here.
