      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about tire costs and I need to figure out the percentage increase. Let me read it again and break it down.\n\nThe question says that new tires from a certain brand last for four years. A customer has two options: buy new tires for $180 each or repair their current tires for $40 each, which adds one more year to their life. I need to find out how much greater the average cost per year is for the new tires compared to repairing the old ones. The answer choices are percentages, so I have to calculate the percentage increase.\n\nHmm, let's think about each option's total cost and then find the average per year.\n\nFirst, the new tires cost $180 each and last four years. So the average cost per year for new tires would be total cost divided by the number of years. That would be $180 / 4 years. Let me calculate that: 180 divided by 4 is 45. So each year, the cost averages $45 per tire.\n\nNow, the repair option. Repairing costs $40 per tire and extends the life by one year. Wait, I need to make sure I understand: the current tires are already in use, right? So if they were going to last, say, three years without repair, repairing adds one more year, making it four? Or wait, maybe the original lifespan isn't given. Hmm, the question says when purchased new, they last for four years. So maybe the current tires have already been used for a certain time, but the problem doesn't specify. Wait, the problem says that repairing will make the current tires last for one additional year. So perhaps without repair, they have some life left, but repairing adds a year. But I'm not sure how much life they have left. Wait, maybe the problem assumes that without repair, the current tires would only last for the same four years as new ones? No, that doesn't make sense. Because the new tires are new, so the current tires must have been in use for some time already. Hmm, I think I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the current tires, without repair, would only last for three years, but I don't think that's given. Let me re-read the problem.\n\nThe problem states: \"tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years.\" So the new tires last four years. The customer can choose to buy new tires for $180 each or repair current tires for $40 each, which makes the current tires last one additional year.\n\nWait, so if the customer repairs the current tires, they get one more year of use. So the total lifespan would be the current lifespan plus one year. But how much life do the current tires have left? The problem doesn't specify. Oh, maybe the current tires have already been used for some time, and without repair, they would only last for another year. Because when you repair, it gives one additional year. Or perhaps the current tires are about to wear out, and repairing adds one year.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are already one year old, and without repair, they would last three more years? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires are about to fail, so without repair, they would last zero additional years, and with repair, they last one more year. That would make sense. So for the repair option, the customer pays $40 to get one more year of use from the current tires.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. The problem says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So, perhaps regardless of their current condition, the repair adds one year. So if the customer chooses to repair, they can get one more year of use from their current tires.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the current tires have already been used for a certain number of years. For example, if the customer has had the tires for two years, they would normally last four years, so they have two years left. If they repair, they get one more year, making it three years left? Or wait, no, because the problem says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So perhaps the repair adds a year to their current lifespan.\n\nWait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach it differently. Maybe the problem is intended to consider that without repair, the current tires would only last for one more year, and with repair, they last two more years? No, that doesn't fit the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that without repair, the current tires would only last for three years. Or maybe the problem is simply saying that each repair adds one year, regardless of their current state. So, for the purpose of this problem, maybe we should assume that the current tires have a certain life left, and adding one year by repair.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here. Let me see if I can find another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is comparing the cost per year for new tires versus the cost of repairing and getting an extra year. Let me try that.\n\nThe new tire option: $180 for four years. So average cost per year is 180 /4 = $45 per year.\n\nThe repair option: the customer pays $40 to get one more year. So the total lifespan becomes four years (if the current tires were going to last three years, perhaps, and repair adds one, making four). Wait, maybe the current tires are three years old and would last one more year without repair. So with repair, they last two more years.\n\nWait, I'm not getting this. Let me try to model it.\n\nLet's say the customer has current tires. The question is, how much longer will they last? Without repair, perhaps they would last for one more year. Repairing them for $40 would make them last for two more years. So the total lifespan after repair is two years instead of one. Or maybe the problem is that without repair, they have zero years left, and repair gives one year.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are about to wear out, so without repair, they wouldn't last any longer. So repair gives them one more year. So the cost for repair is $40 for one year of use.\n\nIn that case, the average cost per year for repair would be $40 / 1 year = $40 per year.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So perhaps the current tires are still usable for a certain period, and the repair adds one more year.\n\nWait, maybe the current tires have a lifespan of N years. Without repair, they would last N years, but with repair, they last N+1 years. But the problem doesn't say what N is. So perhaps the current tires have already been used for three years, and would last one more without repair, making four years total. But that would be the same as the new tires. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because the new tires are being compared to repair.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires are new, but the customer is considering whether to buy new or repair. No, that doesn't make sense because if the tires are new, they would last four years. So the customer probably has used tires, and the question is whether to buy new ones or repair the existing ones.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer has tires that are three years old. The new tires last four years, so if the customer has had their current tires for three years, they have one year left without repair. If they repair, they get one more year, making it two years total. So the lifespan becomes four years? No, that would be more than the new tires.\n\nI think I'm getting stuck here. Let's try another approach. Let me calculate the average cost per year for both options, assuming that the current tires are about to wear out. So without repair, they would last one more year, and with repair, they last two more years. Or perhaps without repair, they wouldn't last any longer, and repair gives one year.\n\nWait, maybe the current tires have been used for some time and without repair, they would only last for one additional year. So the total lifespan after repair is two years.\n\nWait, but the problem says the repair makes the tires last for one additional year. So perhaps the current tires have a certain remaining life, and the repair adds one year on top of that.\n\nBut without knowing the current remaining life, I can't calculate the average cost per year for the repair option. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to be simpler. Maybe the customer has tires that are about to wear out (zero remaining life), and the repair gives them one year. So the repair cost is $40 for one year. So average cost per year is $40 /1 = $40.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer's current tires have been in use for, say, three years, and without repair, they would last one more year, making four years. But the new tires also last four years. So the cost per year for new tires is $45, and for the repair, it's $40 for one year, but that's not the same as four years.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe question is: What is the average cost per year of the new tires compared to repairing. So I think the correct approach is to calculate the average cost per year for each option, then find the percentage increase.\n\nSo for new tires: $180 for four years. Average is 180/4 = $45 per year.\n\nFor the repair: The customer pays $40 to get an additional year. So perhaps the current tires are about to fail, and repair gives one more year. So the total lifespan after repair is one year. So the average cost per year is 40/1 = $40.\n\nWait, but that would make the new tires average $45, repair $40. So the new tires are more expensive by $5 per year. The percentage increase would be (5/40)*100% = 12.5%.\n\nWait, but wait a second. If the customer chooses to repair, perhaps the total cost is $40 for an extra year. So their current tires would have lasted, say, three years, and with repair, they last four. So the average cost per year for repair would be (cost of repair) divided by the additional year. So $40 /1 = $40 per year.\n\nWait, but maybe the customer is considering replacing the tires now, so the current tires have some remaining life. Let's say the customer has had the tires for x years. Without repair, they would last y more years. With repair, they last y+1 years.\n\nBut the problem doesn't give us x or y, so perhaps the problem is intended to be that the repair adds one year, and the total lifespan after repair is four years, same as new tires. So the customer can choose between paying $180 for four years, or paying $40 for an extra year (so total four years). So the repair cost is $40, which gives the same four years as the new tires.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the new tires are four years, and the repair would add one year to the current tires. So if the current tires have been used for three years, without repair, they would last one more, making four years. Repair adds one, making it five? No, that's not matching the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires are already in their third year and will last one more without repair. Repairing them would make them last two more years. So the total lifespan after repair is four years. So the cost is $40 for two years, making the average $20 per year.\n\nWait, but that complicates things further. I'm getting stuck because the problem doesn't specify how much life the current tires have left.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to be that the repair adds one year, regardless of the current state, so the cost is $40 for one additional year. So the average cost per year for repair would be $40 /1 = $40.\n\nIn that case, comparing the two options:\n\nNew tires: $45 per year.\n\nRepair: $40 per year.\n\nSo the question is, how much greater is $45 than $40 in percentage terms.\n\nThe increase is 5 dollars on 40, which is 5/40 = 0.125, which is 12.5%. So the new tires are 12.5% more expensive per year than repairing.\n\nLooking at the options, C is 12.5%, so that would be the answer.\n",

So the new tires are 12.5% more expensive per year than repairing.\n\nLooking at the options, C is 12.5%, so that would be the answer.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage increase in the average cost per year of new tires compared to repairing the current tires, we calculate the average cost per year for both options and then find the percentage difference.\n\n1. **New Tires**:  \n   The cost of new tires is $180, and they last for 4 years.  \n   The average cost per year is:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\$180}{4 \\text{ years}} = \\$45 \\text{ per year}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Repair Option**:  \n   Repairing the current tires costs $40, and it adds one additional year of use.  \n   The average cost per year for the repair is:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\$40}{1 \\text{ year}} = \\$40 \\text{ per year}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Percentage Increase**:  \n   The difference in average cost per year is:  \n   \\[\n   \\$45 - \\$40 = \\$5.\n   \\]  \n   To find the percentage increase relative to the repair cost:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\$5}{\\$40} \\times 100\\% = 12.5\\%.\n   \\]\n\nThus, the average cost per year of new tires is **12.5% greater** than the cost of repairing the current tires.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about tires and costs. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about comparing the average cost per year for new tires versus repairing the current ones. The goal is to find out by what percentage the new tires' average cost is greater than the repair option.\n\nAlright, let's parse the details. When you buy new tires, each costs $180. These tires last for four years. On the other hand, repairing the current tires costs $40 each and extends their life by one year. So, I guess the repair is an option instead of replacing all four tires each time they wear out.\n\nWait, but wait. The problem says the customer can choose to purchase new tires at $180 each or have their current tires repaired. So, I'm assuming the customer currently has tires that are four years old? Or maybe they have tires that are about to wear out, so they're considering whether to replace or repair.\n\nWait, the problem says the new tires last four years when purchased new. So if you buy them now, they'll last four years. Alternatively, you can repair the current tires for $40 each, and that repair makes them last one extra year. So if the current tires are, say, three years old, repairing them would make them last for one more year (total of four years). Or if they're two years old, repair makes them last three years. Wait, but the problem says the repair will make the current tires last for one additional year. So if the current tires were going to last X years, the repair makes them last X+1 years.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the current age of the tires. Wait, maybe it's not about how old they are now but about whether the customer is considering the cost over four years for new tires versus the cost for repairing. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the cost over four years for both options. Let's see.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Each tire is $180. So for four tires, that's 4 * 180 = $720. These tires will last four years. So the average cost per year is total cost divided by four years. So 720 /4 = $180 per year.\n\nWait, but wait, that's the cost for four tires. So each tire is $180, but if you have four tires on a car, you buy four. So the initial cost is 4*180=720 for four years. So per year, that's 720 /4 = 180.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires. Each repair costs $40 per tire. But how many times would you need to repair to make the tires last four years? Or wait, let me think. If the current tires are, say, new (0 years used), then without repair, they would last four years. But if you repair them, each repair adds one year. So if you repair once, they last 4+1=5 years? Or wait, the problem says the repair will make the current tires last for one additional year. So if the current tires were going to last X years, they'll now last X+1.\n\nWait, but perhaps the current tires are already in use. For example, maybe the customer is at year 3 of their tires' life and is considering whether to repair for one more year or buy new. But the problem doesn't specify. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer is considering the option to repair the current tires once, which would make them last an additional year. So the total lifespan of the tires would be four years (original) plus one year (repair) = five years? Or wait, maybe not. Wait, the problem says the new tires last four years when purchased. So perhaps the current tires, if repaired, would last one more year beyond their original lifespan. Wait, I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about comparing the average cost over four years. Let me consider that. So for the new tires, the cost is 720 over four years, which is 180 per year. For the repair option, how much would it cost to have the tires last four years?\n\nWait, if you repair the current tires, each repair adds one year. Suppose the customer's current tires are about to last three years. So, without repair, they have one year left. If you repair once, they last two more years (so total of three years). Wait, no, the repair adds one year. So if the current tires are at year three, they'd have one more year without repair. Repair would add one, making two more years. So they would last four years in total.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's model the situation where the customer is deciding between two options for their tires over a four-year period.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires now. Cost is $180 per tire, so four tires cost $720. They last four years. So average cost per year is 720 /4 = 180.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires. Each repair is $40 per tire. How many repairs would they need to make the tires last four years? Let's think: If the current tires have, say, a remaining life of three years (so they're one year old), then each repair adds one year. So to make them last four years, you'd need two repairs: first repair adds one year, second repair adds another. So total lifespan is 3 + 2 = 5 years? Wait, maybe I'm not getting this right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires have a certain lifespan, and each repair adds one year. So if you repair once, the tires last one more year. Wait, perhaps the initial tires would last four years on their own, and each repair adds one year. So if you repair once, they last five years; twice, six, etc. But in that case, to cover a four-year period, maybe you don't need any repairs if the tires are already expected to last four years. Hmm, I'm getting stuck.\n\nWait, maybe the initial tires are already used. Let me think differently. The problem says that when you buy new tires, they last four years. So if you buy them now, they'll last four years. The other option is to repair the current tires for $40 each, which adds one year to their lifespan.\n\nSo, perhaps the current tires are about to wear out (i.e., they have one year left). So without repair, they'd last one more year. But if you repair them for $40 each, they last two more years (so total of three years from now). But wait, the problem says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So perhaps the original lifespan is four years, and each repair adds one more year.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the current tires are already four years old and about to wear out. So if you repair them, they last one more year (total of five years), but that's not matching the problem statement. The problem states that the new tires last four years when purchased new. So perhaps the current tires, if not repaired, would last four years from the purchase date.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the cost per year for each option over four years. Let me approach it that way.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Cost is $180 per tire, four tires: 4 * 180 = 720. They last four years. So average cost per year is 720 /4 = 180.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires. Each repair is $40 per tire. But how many repairs are needed to cover four years? Let's think. If the current tires are, say, new (so they can last four years without any repair). If you repair them once, they last five years. But that's not necessary if you only need four. So perhaps that's not the scenario. Alternatively, maybe the current tires are about to fail in one year. So without repair, they last one more year. Repairing them would make them last two more years (adding one year). So to cover four years, you'd need two repairs: each repair adds one year beyond their current lifespan.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck on the scenario. Maybe I should model it differently. Let's think about the cost per year for each option, regardless of the initial state.\n\nOption 1: New tires. Cost is $720 for four years. So per year, $180.\n\nOption 2: Repairing. Let's say you repair the current tires once for $40 each. That adds one year. So if you repair once, the tires last one extra year. But how does this fit into a four-year plan? Let's think: If you repair once, the tires last an extra year, so from four years to five. But if you only need four years, perhaps you don't need a repair. Hmm, perhaps this is not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer is considering replacing the tires every four years, while the repair option allows them to extend the life by one year each time they repair. So for example, instead of replacing every four years, they can repair each set of tires once, extending each set's life by one year.\n\nWait, but the question is about the average cost per year over four years, I think. So let's calculate the cost per year for each option.\n\nOption 1: New tires. Cost is 720 over four years. 720 /4 = 180 per year.\n\nOption 2: Repairing. How much does it cost to have tires that last four years? Let's say the customer has current tires that, without repair, would last four years. If they repair once, they last five years. But the customer only needs four years, so perhaps they don't need to repair. Alternatively, perhaps the current tires are at the end of their life, and the customer is considering whether to buy new or repair once for an extra year. But this would only cover one additional year, not four.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. The problem is about the average cost per year. So perhaps for four years, which option is cheaper on average.\n\nFor new tires: 720 /4 = 180 per year.\n\nFor the repair option: Let's say the customer chooses to repair their current tires. Each repair costs 40 per tire. How many repairs would they need to cover four years? Suppose the current tires are about to last one more year. So without repair, they have one year. Repair once, they last two years. But the customer needs four years. So maybe they repair twice. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial tires (without repair) last four years. So without repair, they'd last four years. Repairing them once would make them last five years. But the customer needs a four-year period. So perhaps they don't need any repairs. But that doesn't make sense because the repair option would then be more expensive.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the cost per year for each option over their respective lifespans.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's calculate the average cost per year for each option.\n\nOption 1: New tires.\n\nTotal cost: 4 * 180 = 720.\n\nLifespan: 4 years.\n\nAverage cost per year: 720 /4 = 180.\n\nOption 2: Repair.\n\nEach repair costs 40 per tire and adds one year to the lifespan.\n\nAssuming that the customer needs the tires to last for four years. So the current tires (without repair) would last four years. If they repair once, the lifespan becomes five years. But the customer only needs four, so perhaps they don't need to repair. But then the cost would be zero, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires are already in their third year, so they have one year left. So without repair, they last one more year. To make them last four years, they need to be replaced after one year, but that's not possible with repair. Hmm, maybe I'm not getting it right.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as, for the same four-year period, how much would each option cost.\n\nNew tires: 720, as before.\n\nRepair option: To have the tires last four years, perhaps you can repair them once, making them last five years. But the customer only needs four years. So perhaps they can repair once, which costs 40 *4 = 160, and the tires last five years, which covers the four-year period. So the total cost for the four years would be 160.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if you repair the current tires once, the tires last five years, which is more than enough for the four-year period. So the cost is 160 for four years, giving an average of 160 /4 = 40 per year.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 40 is less than 180, which would make the new tires more expensive, but the problem says the new tires' average cost is what percent greater than the repair option. So perhaps that's the way.\n\nWait, let me check this again. If the current tires are about to last four years without repair. So without repair, they have four years left. If I repair them once, they last five years. So for a four-year period, the repair once would suffice, and the cost is 40 *4 = 160.\n\nSo the average cost per year for the repair option is 160 /4 =40.\n\nSo new tires average 180, repair option averages 40. So the question is, 180 is what percent greater than 40.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, if the current tires are about to last four years, why would you repair them? Because you're already getting four years from them without repair. So maybe the repair option is when the tires are older, and each repair extends their life by one year.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are at year 3, so they have one year left. Without repair, they'll last one more year. But if you repair once, they last two more years, making the total lifespan three years from now. But the customer needs four years. So they would need to repair once, and then perhaps again after that?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's go back.\n\nThe problem says the customer can choose to buy new tires or repair current tires. The repair makes the current tires last one additional year. So the repair extends their lifespan by one year beyond what they would have been without the repair.\n\nSo, if the current tires are about to last three years without repair (so they're one year old), then a repair would make them last four years. So for the customer, if they repair, they can have tires that last four years, same as new.\n\nIn that case, the repair cost would be 40 per tire, so four tires would cost 4*40=160. This would make the tires last four years.\n\nSo for four years, the new tires cost 720, and the repair option costs 160.\n\nSo average cost per year:\n\nNew tires: 720 /4 = 180.\n\nRepair option: 160 /4 =40.\n\nSo the question is, by what percentage is 180 greater than 40.\n\nTo find the percentage increase, the formula is: (Higher Value - Lower Value)/Lower Value * 100%.\n\nSo (180 -40)/40 *100% = (140)/40 *100% = 3.5 *100% = 350%.\n\nWait, but that's not one of the options. The options are A)8%, B)10%, C)12.5%, D)16.7%, E)25%.\n\nHmm, so I must have made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair option isn't 40 per tire, but per repair. Wait, no, the problem says the repair is $40 per tire. So for four tires, that's 4*40=160.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's read the problem again.\n\n\"A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\"\n\nSo each repair is $40 per tire. Each repair adds one year. So for four tires, each repair is 4*40=160. So each repair adds one year. So if the current tires are about to last four years without repair, then a repair would make them last five years. But the customer wants four years of use. So perhaps they don't need to repair, but that would mean the repair option isn't useful in this case. So perhaps I'm not considering the correct scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires are about to last three years. So without repair, they'll last three years. Repair once: four years. So for a four-year period, the repair is sufficient. So the cost is 160 for four years. So average per year is 40.\n\nWait, but that would make the new tires average 180, repair 40. The percentage increase is (180-40)/40 = 3.5, which is 350%, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the average cost for the repair option. Let me re-calculate.\n\nIf the customer chooses to repair, they spend 40 per tire once, making the tires last one extra year. So the tires can now last four years (if they were three years old) or five if they were four years old. But perhaps the customer needs the tires for four years. So let's model it as:\n\nIf the current tires are about to last three years without repair, then after repair, they'll last four years. So the repair cost is 40 per tire, so 160 total. So for four years, the cost is 160, average is 40 per year.\n\nSo new tires average 180, repair average 40. The question is, how much greater is 180 than 40 in percentage terms.\n\nSo the increase is 180 -40 =140. 140 is what percentage of 40? 140/40=3.5=350%. But none of the options is 350%, so I must have a mistake in my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate the cost per year for each tire. Let's see.\n\nNew tires: each tire costs 180, lasts four years. So per year per tire: 180/4=45.\n\nRepair option: each repair is 40, adds one year. So if you have a tire that can last four years without repair, you can repair it once, making it last five years. So the cost per year would be (40 +180) /5 = 220/5=44. That's cheaper than 45. So new tires are more expensive.\n\nWait, but that's getting more complicated. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not about the same number of tires, but about the cost per tire per year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer is considering replacing the tires every four years, and the repair option is a way to extend the life beyond four years. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about the average cost per year for the new tires versus the repair option. Let me try another approach.\n\nSuppose the customer buys new tires. The cost is 4*180=720 for four years. So average cost per year is 180.\n\nIf the customer chooses to repair, let's say the current tires are about to last three years. So without repair, they have three years left. Repairing once adds one more year, making it four years. So the cost is 4*40=160 for four years. So average cost per year is 40.\n\nSo the new tires cost 180 per year, repair option is 40. So the new tires are 180/40=4.5 times more expensive. So the percentage increase is 350%, which isn't an option.\n\nHmm, this suggests I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the repair is per tire, but it's not necessary to repair all four tires each time. Let me think differently. Perhaps the customer can choose to repair each tire when needed, thereby extending their lifespan.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that each repair is done once, making the tires last one additional year, so the total lifespan is four years (original) + one year (repair) = five years. So for a five-year period, the cost is 4*40=160. But the question is about four years, so perhaps that's not relevant.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the new tires last four years, and the repair option allows the current tires to last one more year, making their total lifespan four years as well (if the original was three). So in that case, the cost for the repair is 40*4=160 for four years, same as the new tires' cost of 720. But that can't be right because 720 is much more than 160.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look at the answer choices and see if I can reverse-engineer it.\n\nThe options are 8%,10%,12.5%,16.7%,25%.\n\nSo perhaps the average cost for new tires is, say, 180, and repair is 144, making the difference 36, which is 25% (36/144=0.25=25%). But that's just a guess.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the repair option's average cost. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose the customer's current tires are about to last four years without repair. If they repair once, the tires last five years. So for a four-year period, the repair is not needed because the tires would already last four years. So the repair cost would be zero for four years, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires are about to last three years. So without repair, they have three years. Repair once, they last four years. So the cost is 4*40=160 for four years. So average per year is 40.\n\nBut as I calculated before, that gives a 350% increase, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm not correctly modeling the scenario.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer can repair the tires multiple times. Like, each repair adds a year, and you can repair them multiple times to cover the four years. For example, if the current tires are about to last one year without repair, each repair adds one year. So to have four years, you need three repairs. Each repair is 40 per tire, so 4 tires *40=160 per repair. So three repairs would cost 3*160=480. Then, the average cost per year would be 480/4=120.\n\nSo new tires: 180 per year.\n\nRepair option: 120 per year.\n\nSo the increase is (180-120)/120 = 60/120=0.5=50%. Not an option.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm not approaching this correctly. Let me try to think of the average cost per year for each option.\n\nNew tires: 720 total for four years. 720/4=180 per year.\n\nRepair option: Let's say the customer chooses to repair each time the tires wear out. So, perhaps the tires last one year, then repair adds one, making two years. Then again, repair adds another, making three years. Then repair again for a total of four years. So four tires, each repair is 40, so 4*40=160 per repair. So for four years, how many repairs are needed?\n\nWait, if the tires are being repaired each time they wear out, perhaps the first repair is after one year, making them last two years, so total of three years. Then another repair after two years, making it four. Wait, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each repair adds one year, so for four years, you need four tires, each repaired once, adding one year. So four tires, each repaired once, 4*40=160. So for four years, total cost is 160. So average per year is 40.\n\nBut that brings us back to the same issue, where 180 is 350% more than 40, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the repair cost. Maybe the repair cost is per tire, and each repair extends the life by one year, but you don't have to repair all four tires each time. For example, you can repair just one tire when it's worn out, but that seems impractical.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer only needs the tires for four years, and the repair option allows them to have four years of use for a lower cost.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering that each repair adds one year to the current tires, so that the total lifespan of the current tires becomes four years (if they were three years old before repair). So the cost is 4*40=160 for four years. So average is 40 per year.\n\nThen, the new tires are 180 per year, repair is 40. So the percentage increase is (180-40)/40=3.5=350%, which isn't an option. So I must be making a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not considering that the customer can repair the tires multiple times over four years, not just once. Let's model it as such.\n\nSuppose the customer's current tires are about to last one year without repair. So without repair, they have one year left. To make them last four years, they need to repair them three times, each adding one year.\n\nEach repair costs 40 per tire, so four tires: 4*40=160 per repair.\n\nThree repairs: 3*160=480.\n\nSo over four years, the cost is 480, which averages to 480/4=120 per year.\n\nNew tires average 180 per year. So the increase is (180-120)/120=60/120=0.5=50%. Not an option.\n\nHmm, not matching any options. I'm stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer can repair the tires only once, making them last five years, but the customer needs only four. So the cost is 160 for five years, so per year, 32. So 180 is higher than 32. 180-32=148. 148/32=4.625=462.5%, which also isn't an option.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe I should try another approach. Perhaps the average cost per year is calculated differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the cost per tire per year. Let me try that.\n\nNew tires: 180 per tire, last four years. So per year per tire: 180/4=45.\n\nRepair option: 40 per tire repair, adds one year. So each tire can be repaired once, making their lifespan five years. So the cost per tire is 180 (original) +40 (repair) =220 over five years. So per year: 220/5=44.\n\nWait, that's cheaper than 45. So new tires are 45, repair is 44. So the new tires are more expensive by 1. So percentage increase is (45-44)/44=1/44\u22482.27%, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, but perhaps the repair isn't adding to the new cost but is an alternative. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is an alternative to buying new tires. So if the customer chooses to repair, they don't buy new tires but repair the existing ones, which would last one more year.\n\nWait, perhaps the scenario is: the customer currently has tires that are about to wear out (so they have one year left). They can either buy new tires (four years of use) or repair the current ones to last two more years (adding one year to their current lifespan of one year).\n\nSo, in this case:\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Cost: 4*180=720. Lifespan: four years. Average cost per year: 720/4=180.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires. Cost: 4*40=160. Lifespan: two years (current one year plus one more). So the tires would last two years. But the customer needs four years of use. So perhaps this isn't sufficient, meaning they'd have to repair again after two years.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the repair adds one additional year. So if the current tires are about to last one year, repair adds one, making two. So after two years, they would again need to repair or replace. But the customer is considering a four-year period, so perhaps they need two repairs.\n\nEach repair costs 160, so two repairs: 320. Lifespan: 1 +1 (first repair) +1 (second repair) =3 years. Hmm, not enough for four years. So perhaps three repairs: 480, making lifespan 4 years (1+3 repairs). So average cost per year:480/4=120.\n\nSo new tires average 180, repair option averages 120. The percentage increase is (180-120)/120=60/120=0.5=50%, which isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it and the problem is simply comparing the cost per year for new tires versus the cost of repairing once and using for one more year.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the average cost per year over the lifespan of the tires for each option.\n\nFor new tires: 720 for four years, average 180.\n\nFor repair: the customer pays 40 per tire, and the tires last one more year. So if the tires were going to last four years, repair makes them last five. So the cost is 160 for five years, so average per year is 32.\n\nSo new tires average 180, repair 32. The increase is (180-32)/32=148/32=4.625=462.5%. Not an option.\n\nThis isn't working. I'm probably misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the cost per tire per year, not for all four tires.\n\nNew tires: 180 per tire, last four years. So per year: 180/4=45.\n\nRepair: 40 per tire, adds one year. So if you repair once, the tire lasts five years. So the cost per tire is 180 (if you buy new) or 40 (if you repair). Wait, but the problem says the customer can choose to buy new or repair. So perhaps the repair is an alternative to buying new.\n\nWait, perhaps the scenario is that the customer's current tires are about to wear out, so they can either buy new tires (180 each, four years) or repair the current ones (40 each, adding one year).\n\nSo for the customer, if they repair, they'll have tires that last one more year (so one year from now). Then, after that, they can repair again, adding another year, and so on.\n\nBut for a four-year period, how much would that cost?\n\nIf they repair once, they have one more year, so total two years. Then, they need to repair again, adding another year, making three years. Then repair again, making four years.\n\nSo for four years, they need three repairs. Each repair is four tires *40=160. So three repairs: 480.\n\nSo for four years, the cost is 480, average per year: 120.\n\nNew tires: 720, average 180.\n\nSo the increase is (180-120)/120=0.5=50%, which again isn't an option.\n\nI'm clearly missing something here. Let me try to read the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"when purchased new, last for four years. A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\"\n\nAh! Oh, wait a second. Perhaps the repair is done once, and the current tires last one additional year beyond their original lifespan. So if the current tires are, say, three years old and have one year left, repairing them makes them last two more years (total four years from now). So the repair cost is 40 per tire, so 160 for four tires.\n\nSo for four years, the cost is 160. So average per year:40.\n\nNew tires: 720/4=180.\n\nSo the average cost per year for new is 180, for repair it's 40.\n\nSo the increase is (180-40)/40=3.5=350%, which isn't an option. So perhaps this isn't the right way to model it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the current tires are already four years old and about to wear out. So without repair, they have zero years left. Repairing them makes them last one additional year. So for four tires, that's 160, and they last one year. So the average cost per year is 160/1=160.\n\nBut that's way higher than new tires' average of 180. So the new tires would be cheaper, which contradicts the question.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to calculate the average cost per year for each option, but perhaps I'm not considering the correct scenario.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the cost per tire per year, not for all four tires. Let's see.\n\nNew tires: 180 per tire, lasts four years. So per year per tire: 45.\n\nRepair: 40 per tire, adds one year. So if you repair once, the tire lasts five years. So per year: (180 +40)/5=220/5=44.\n\nWait, but that's if you're comparing buying new versus repairing once. So the new tire's cost per year is 45, repair is 44. So new is 1 more, which is 2.27% higher, which isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is an alternative to buying new. So the customer has old tires that they can repair once for 40 each, making them last one more year. So for one more year, they pay 160. So the average cost per year for that one year is 160.\n\nBut then, perhaps they would need to buy new tires after that, which would cost 720 for four years. So the total for five years would be 160 +720=880. Average per year:880/5=176.\n\nBut that's not directly comparing to new tires.\n\nI'm clearly not getting this right. Let me try to think differently.\n\nThe question is asking for the average cost per year of the new tires compared to the repair option. So perhaps the average cost for new tires is 180, and for the repair option, it's 40.\n\nSo the percentage increase is (180-40)/40=350%. But that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the average cost per year for the repair option is not 40. Maybe it's 40 per tire per year. So four tires would be 160 per year. Wait, that's not right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair cost is 40 per tire, and the tires last one more year. So the average cost per tire per year is 40/1=40. New tires are 180/4=45. So new is 45, repair is 40.\n\nSo the percentage increase is (45-40)/40=12.5%, which is option C.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because 45 is 12.5% higher than 40. Because 40 *1.125=45.\n\nSo the answer would be 12.5%, option C.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves comparing the average cost per year of purchasing new tires versus repairing current tires. Here's the analysis:\n\n1. **New Tires Option**:  \n   - Cost per tire: $180.  \n   - Lifespan: 4 years.  \n   - Total cost for four tires: $180 \u00d7 4 = $720.  \n   - Average cost per year: $720 \u00f7 4 = **$180**.\n\n2. **Repair Option**:  \n   - Repair cost per tire: $40.  \n   - Repair extends the lifespan of the current tires by one additional year.  \n   - Assuming the customer needs tires for four years, the repair cost for four tires is: $40 \u00d7 4 = **$160**.  \n   - Average cost per year: $160 \u00f7 4 = **$40**.\n\n3. **Percentage Increase Calculation**:  \n   - The average cost per year for new tires ($180) is compared to the average cost per year for the repair option ($40).  \n   - The formula for percentage increase is:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\frac{\\text{Higher Value} - \\text{Lower Value}}{\\text{Lower Value}} \\times 100\\%\n     \\]  \n   - Substituting the values:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\frac{180 - 40}{40} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{140}{40} \\times 100\\% = 3.5 \\times 100\\% = 350\\%\n     \\]  \n   - However, this result does not match any of the provided options.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about tires and costs. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about comparing the average cost per year for new tires versus repairing the current ones. The goal is to find out by what percentage the new tires' average cost is greater than the repair option.\n\nAlright, let's parse the details. When you buy new tires, each costs $180. These tires last for four years. On the other hand, repairing the current tires costs $40 each and extends their life by one year. So, I guess the repair is an option instead of replacing all four tires each time they wear out.\n\nWait, but wait. The problem says the customer can choose to purchase new tires at $180 each or have their current tires repaired. So, I'm assuming the customer currently has tires that are four years old? Or maybe they have tires that are about to wear out, so they're considering whether to replace or repair.\n\nWait, the problem says the new tires last four years when purchased new. So if you buy them now, they'll last four years. Alternatively, you can repair the current tires for $40 each, and that repair makes them last one extra year. So if the current tires are, say, three years old, repairing them would make them last for one more year (total of four years). Or if they're two years old, repair makes them last three years. Wait, but the problem says the repair will make the current tires last for one additional year. So if the current tires were going to last X years, the repair makes them last X+1 years.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the current age of the tires. Wait, maybe it's not about how old they are now but about whether the customer is considering the cost over four years for new tires versus the cost for repairing. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the cost over four years for both options. Let's see.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Each tire is $180. So for four tires, that's 4 * 180 = $720. These tires will last four years. So the average cost per year is total cost divided by four years. So 720 /4 = $180 per year.\n\nWait, but wait, that's the cost for four tires. So each tire is $180, but if you have four tires on a car, you buy four. So the initial cost is 4*180=720 for four years. So per year, that's 720 /4 = 180.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires. Each repair costs $40 per tire. But how many times would you need to repair to make the tires last four years? Or wait, let me think. If the current tires are, say, new (0 years used), then without repair, they would last four years. But if you repair them, each repair adds one year. So if you repair once, they last 4+1=5 years? Or wait, the problem says the repair will make the current tires last for one additional year. So if the current tires were going to last X years, they'll now last X+1.\n\nWait, but perhaps the current tires are already in use. For example, maybe the customer is at year 3 of their tires' life and is considering whether to repair for one more year or buy new. But the problem doesn't specify. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer is considering the option to repair the current tires once, which would make them last an additional year. So the total lifespan of the tires would be four years (original) plus one year (repair) = five years? Or wait, maybe not. Wait, the problem says the new tires last four years when purchased. So perhaps the current tires, if repaired, would last one more year beyond their original lifespan. Wait, I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about comparing the average cost over four years. Let me consider that. So for the new tires, the cost is 720 over four years, which is 180 per year. For the repair option, how much would it cost to have the tires last four years?\n\nWait, if you repair the current tires, each repair adds one year. Suppose the customer's current tires are about to last three years. So, without repair, they have one year left. If you repair once, they last two more years (so total of three years). Wait, no, the repair adds one year. So if the current tires are at year three, they'd have one more year without repair. Repair would add one, making two more years. So they would last four years in total.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's model the situation where the customer is deciding between two options for their tires over a four-year period.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires now. Cost is $180 per tire, so four tires cost $720. They last four years. So average cost per year is 720 /4 = 180.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires. Each repair is $40 per tire. How many repairs would they need to make the tires last four years? Let's think: If the current tires have, say, a remaining life of three years (so they're one year old), then each repair adds one year. So to make them last four years, you'd need two repairs: first repair adds one year, second repair adds another. So total lifespan is 3 + 2 = 5 years? Wait, maybe I'm not getting this right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires have a certain lifespan, and each repair adds one year. So if you repair once, the tires last one more year. Wait, perhaps the initial tires would last four years on their own, and each repair adds one year. So if you repair once, they last five years; twice, six, etc. But in that case, to cover a four-year period, maybe you don't need any repairs if the tires are already expected to last four years. Hmm, I'm getting stuck.\n\nWait, maybe the initial tires are already used. Let me think differently. The problem says that when you buy new tires, they last four years. So if you buy them now, they'll last four years. The other option is to repair the current tires for $40 each, which adds one year to their lifespan.\n\nSo, perhaps the current tires are about to wear out (i.e., they have one year left). So without repair, they'd last one more year. But if you repair them for $40 each, they last two more years (so total of three years from now). But wait, the problem says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So perhaps the original lifespan is four years, and each repair adds one more year.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the current tires are already four years old and about to wear out. So if you repair them, they last one more year (total of five years), but that's not matching the problem statement. The problem states that the new tires last four years when purchased new. So perhaps the current tires, if not repaired, would last four years from the purchase date.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the cost per year for each option over four years. Let me approach it that way.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Cost is $180 per tire, four tires: 4 * 180 = 720. They last four years. So average cost per year is 720 /4 = 180.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires. Each repair is $40 per tire. But how many repairs are needed to cover four years? Let's think. If the current tires are, say, new (so they can last four years without any repair). If you repair them once, they last five years. But that's not necessary if you only need four. So perhaps that's not the scenario. Alternatively, maybe the current tires are about to fail in one year. So without repair, they last one more year. Repairing them would make them last two more years (adding one year). So to cover four years, you'd need two repairs: each repair adds one year beyond their current lifespan.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck on the scenario. Maybe I should model it differently. Let's think about the cost per year for each option, regardless of the initial state.\n\nOption 1: New tires. Cost is $720 for four years. So per year, $180.\n\nOption 2: Repairing. Let's say you repair the current tires once for $40 each. That adds one year. So if you repair once, the tires last one extra year. But how does this fit into a four-year plan? Let's think: If you repair once, the tires last an extra year, so from four years to five. But if you only need four years, perhaps you don't need a repair. Hmm, perhaps this is not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer is considering replacing the tires every four years, while the repair option allows them to extend the life by one year each time they repair. So for example, instead of replacing every four years, they can repair each set of tires once, extending each set's life by one year.\n\nWait, but the question is about the average cost per year over four years, I think. So let's calculate the cost per year for each option.\n\nOption 1: New tires. Cost is 720 over four years. 720 /4 = 180 per year.\n\nOption 2: Repairing. How much does it cost to have tires that last four years? Let's say the customer has current tires that, without repair, would last four years. If they repair once, they last five years. But the customer only needs four years, so perhaps they don't need to repair. Alternatively, perhaps the current tires are at the end of their life, and the customer is considering whether to buy new or repair once for an extra year. But this would only cover one additional year, not four.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. The problem is about the average cost per year. So perhaps for four years, which option is cheaper on average.\n\nFor new tires: 720 /4 = 180 per year.\n\nFor the repair option: Let's say the customer chooses to repair their current tires. Each repair costs 40 per tire. How many repairs would they need to cover four years? Suppose the current tires are about to last one more year. So without repair, they have one year. Repair once, they last two years. But the customer needs four years. So maybe they repair twice. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial tires (without repair) last four years. So without repair, they'd last four years. Repairing them once would make them last five years. But the customer needs a four-year period. So perhaps they don't need any repairs. But that doesn't make sense because the repair option would then be more expensive.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the cost per year for each option over their respective lifespans.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's calculate the average cost per year for each option.\n\nOption 1: New tires.\n\nTotal cost: 4 * 180 = 720.\n\nLifespan: 4 years.\n\nAverage cost per year: 720 /4 = 180.\n\nOption 2: Repair.\n\nEach repair costs 40 per tire and adds one year to the lifespan.\n\nAssuming that the customer needs the tires to last for four years. So the current tires (without repair) would last four years. If they repair once, the lifespan becomes five years. But the customer only needs four, so perhaps they don't need to repair. But then the cost would be zero, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires are already in their third year, so they have one year left. So without repair, they last one more year. To make them last four years, they need to be replaced after one year, but that's not possible with repair. Hmm, maybe I'm not getting it right.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as, for the same four-year period, how much would each option cost.\n\nNew tires: 720, as before.\n\nRepair option: To have the tires last four years, perhaps you can repair them once, making them last five years. But the customer only needs four years. So perhaps they can repair once, which costs 40 *4 = 160, and the tires last five years, which covers the four-year period. So the total cost for the four years would be 160.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if you repair the current tires once, the tires last five years, which is more than enough for the four-year period. So the cost is 160 for four years, giving an average of 160 /4 = 40 per year.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 40 is less than 180, which would make the new tires more expensive, but the problem says the new tires' average cost is what percent greater than the repair option. So perhaps that's the way.\n\nWait, let me check this again. If the current tires are about to last four years without repair. So without repair, they have four years left. If I repair them once, they last five years. So for a four-year period, the repair once would suffice, and the cost is 40 *4 = 160.\n\nSo the average cost per year for the repair option is 160 /4 =40.\n\nSo new tires average 180, repair option averages 40. So the question is, 180 is what percent greater than 40.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, if the current tires are about to last four years, why would you repair them? Because you're already getting four years from them without repair. So maybe the repair option is when the tires are older, and each repair extends their life by one year.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are at year 3, so they have one year left. Without repair, they'll last one more year. But if you repair once, they last two more years, making the total lifespan three years from now. But the customer needs four years. So they would need to repair once, and then perhaps again after that?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's go back.\n\nThe problem says the customer can choose to buy new tires or repair current tires. The repair makes the current tires last one additional year. So the repair extends their lifespan by one year beyond what they would have been without the repair.\n\nSo, if the current tires are about to last three years without repair (so they're one year old), then a repair would make them last four years. So for the customer, if they repair, they can have tires that last four years, same as new.\n\nIn that case, the repair cost would be 40 per tire, so four tires would cost 4*40=160. This would make the tires last four years.\n\nSo for four years, the new tires cost 720, and the repair option costs 160.\n\nSo average cost per year:\n\nNew tires: 720 /4 = 180.\n\nRepair option: 160 /4 =40.\n\nSo the question is, by what percentage is 180 greater than 40.\n\nTo find the percentage increase, the formula is: (Higher Value - Lower Value)/Lower Value * 100%.\n\nSo (180 -40)/40 *100% = (140)/40 *100% = 3.5 *100% = 350%.\n\nWait, but that's not one of the options. The options are A)8%, B)10%, C)12.5%, D)16.7%, E)25%.\n\nHmm, so I must have made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair option isn't 40 per tire, but per repair. Wait, no, the problem says the repair is $40 per tire. So for four tires, that's 4*40=160.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's read the problem again.\n\n\"A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\"\n\nSo each repair is $40 per tire. Each repair adds one year. So for four tires, each repair is 4*40=160. So each repair adds one year. So if the current tires are about to last four years without repair, then a repair would make them last five years. But the customer wants four years of use. So perhaps they don't need to repair, but that would mean the repair option isn't useful in this case. So perhaps I'm not considering the correct scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires are about to last three years. So without repair, they'll last three years. Repair once: four years. So for a four-year period, the repair is sufficient. So the cost is 160 for four years. So average per year is 40.\n\nWait, but that would make the new tires average 180, repair 40. The percentage increase is (180-40)/40 = 3.5, which is 350%, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the average cost for the repair option. Let me re-calculate.\n\nIf the customer chooses to repair, they spend 40 per tire once, making the tires last one extra year. So the tires can now last four years (if they were three years old) or five if they were four years old. But perhaps the customer needs the tires for four years. So let's model it as:\n\nIf the current tires are about to last three years without repair, then after repair, they'll last four years. So the repair cost is 40 per tire, so 160 total. So for four years, the cost is 160, average is 40 per year.\n\nSo new tires average 180, repair average 40. The question is, how much greater is 180 than 40 in percentage terms.\n\nSo the increase is 180 -40 =140. 140 is what percentage of 40? 140/40=3.5=350%. But none of the options is 350%, so I must have a mistake in my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate the cost per year for each tire. Let's see.\n\nNew tires: each tire costs 180, lasts four years. So per year per tire: 180/4=45.\n\nRepair option: each repair is 40, adds one year. So if you have a tire that can last four years without repair, you can repair it once, making it last five years. So the cost per year would be (40 +180) /5 = 220/5=44. That's cheaper than 45. So new tires are more expensive.\n\nWait, but that's getting more complicated. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not about the same number of tires, but about the cost per tire per year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer is considering replacing the tires every four years, and the repair option is a way to extend the life beyond four years. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about the average cost per year for the new tires versus the repair option. Let me try another approach.\n\nSuppose the customer buys new tires. The cost is 4*180=720 for four years. So average cost per year is 180.\n\nIf the customer chooses to repair, let's say the current tires are about to last three years. So without repair, they have three years left. Repairing once adds one more year, making it four years. So the cost is 4*40=160 for four years. So average cost per year is 40.\n\nSo the new tires cost 180 per year, repair option is 40. So the new tires are 180/40=4.5 times more expensive. So the percentage increase is 350%, which isn't an option.\n\nHmm, this suggests I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the repair is per tire, but it's not necessary to repair all four tires each time. Let me think differently. Perhaps the customer can choose to repair each tire when needed, thereby extending their lifespan.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that each repair is done once, making the tires last one additional year, so the total lifespan is four years (original) + one year (repair) = five years. So for a five-year period, the cost is 4*40=160. But the question is about four years, so perhaps that's not relevant.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the new tires last four years, and the repair option allows the current tires to last one more year, making their total lifespan four years as well (if the original was three). So in that case, the cost for the repair is 40*4=160 for four years, same as the new tires' cost of 720. But that can't be right because 720 is much more than 160.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look at the answer choices and see if I can reverse-engineer it.\n\nThe options are 8%,10%,12.5%,16.7%,25%.\n\nSo perhaps the average cost for new tires is, say, 180, and repair is 144, making the difference 36, which is 25% (36/144=0.25=25%). But that's just a guess.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the repair option's average cost. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose the customer's current tires are about to last four years without repair. If they repair once, the tires last five years. So for a four-year period, the repair is not needed because the tires would already last four years. So the repair cost would be zero for four years, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires are about to last three years. So without repair, they have three years. Repair once, they last four years. So the cost is 4*40=160 for four years. So average per year is 40.\n\nBut as I calculated before, that gives a 350% increase, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm not correctly modeling the scenario.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer can repair the tires multiple times. Like, each repair adds a year, and you can repair them multiple times to cover the four years. For example, if the current tires are about to last one year without repair, each repair adds one year. So to have four years, you need three repairs. Each repair is 40 per tire, so 4 tires *40=160 per repair. So three repairs would cost 3*160=480. Then, the average cost per year would be 480/4=120.\n\nSo new tires: 180 per year.\n\nRepair option: 120 per year.\n\nSo the increase is (180-120)/120 = 60/120=0.5=50%. Not an option.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm not approaching this correctly. Let me try to think of the average cost per year for each option.\n\nNew tires: 720 total for four years. 720/4=180 per year.\n\nRepair option: Let's say the customer chooses to repair each time the tires wear out. So, perhaps the tires last one year, then repair adds one, making two years. Then again, repair adds another, making three years. Then repair again for a total of four years. So four tires, each repair is 40, so 4*40=160 per repair. So for four years, how many repairs are needed?\n\nWait, if the tires are being repaired each time they wear out, perhaps the first repair is after one year, making them last two years, so total of three years. Then another repair after two years, making it four. Wait, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each repair adds one year, so for four years, you need four tires, each repaired once, adding one year. So four tires, each repaired once, 4*40=160. So for four years, total cost is 160. So average per year is 40.\n\nBut that brings us back to the same issue, where 180 is 350% more than 40, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the repair cost. Maybe the repair cost is per tire, and each repair extends the life by one year, but you don't have to repair all four tires each time. For example, you can repair just one tire when it's worn out, but that seems impractical.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer only needs the tires for four years, and the repair option allows them to have four years of use for a lower cost.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering that each repair adds one year to the current tires, so that the total lifespan of the current tires becomes four years (if they were three years old before repair). So the cost is 4*40=160 for four years. So average is 40 per year.\n\nThen, the new tires are 180 per year, repair is 40. So the percentage increase is (180-40)/40=3.5=350%, which isn't an option. So I must be making a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not considering that the customer can repair the tires multiple times over four years, not just once. Let's model it as such.\n\nSuppose the customer's current tires are about to last one year without repair. So without repair, they have one year left. To make them last four years, they need to repair them three times, each adding one year.\n\nEach repair costs 40 per tire, so four tires: 4*40=160 per repair.\n\nThree repairs: 3*160=480.\n\nSo over four years, the cost is 480, which averages to 480/4=120 per year.\n\nNew tires average 180 per year. So the increase is (180-120)/120=60/120=0.5=50%. Not an option.\n\nHmm, not matching any options. I'm stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer can repair the tires only once, making them last five years, but the customer needs only four. So the cost is 160 for five years, so per year, 32. So 180 is higher than 32. 180-32=148. 148/32=4.625=462.5%, which also isn't an option.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe I should try another approach. Perhaps the average cost per year is calculated differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the cost per tire per year. Let me try that.\n\nNew tires: 180 per tire, last four years. So per year per tire: 180/4=45.\n\nRepair option: 40 per tire repair, adds one year. So each tire can be repaired once, making their lifespan five years. So the cost per tire is 180 (original) +40 (repair) =220 over five years. So per year: 220/5=44.\n\nWait, that's cheaper than 45. So new tires are 45, repair is 44. So the new tires are more expensive by 1. So percentage increase is (45-44)/44=1/44\u22482.27%, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, but perhaps the repair isn't adding to the new cost but is an alternative. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is an alternative to buying new tires. So if the customer chooses to repair, they don't buy new tires but repair the existing ones, which would last one more year.\n\nWait, perhaps the scenario is: the customer currently has tires that are about to wear out (so they have one year left). They can either buy new tires (four years of use) or repair the current ones to last two more years (adding one year to their current lifespan of one year).\n\nSo, in this case:\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Cost: 4*180=720. Lifespan: four years. Average cost per year: 720/4=180.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires. Cost: 4*40=160. Lifespan: two years (current one year plus one more). So the tires would last two years. But the customer needs four years of use. So perhaps this isn't sufficient, meaning they'd have to repair again after two years.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the repair adds one additional year. So if the current tires are about to last one year, repair adds one, making two. So after two years, they would again need to repair or replace. But the customer is considering a four-year period, so perhaps they need two repairs.\n\nEach repair costs 160, so two repairs: 320. Lifespan: 1 +1 (first repair) +1 (second repair) =3 years. Hmm, not enough for four years. So perhaps three repairs: 480, making lifespan 4 years (1+3 repairs). So average cost per year:480/4=120.\n\nSo new tires average 180, repair option averages 120. The percentage increase is (180-120)/120=60/120=0.5=50%, which isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it and the problem is simply comparing the cost per year for new tires versus the cost of repairing once and using for one more year.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the average cost per year over the lifespan of the tires for each option.\n\nFor new tires: 720 for four years, average 180.\n\nFor repair: the customer pays 40 per tire, and the tires last one more year. So if the tires were going to last four years, repair makes them last five. So the cost is 160 for five years, so average per year is 32.\n\nSo new tires average 180, repair 32. The increase is (180-32)/32=148/32=4.625=462.5%. Not an option.\n\nThis isn't working. I'm probably misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the cost per tire per year, not for all four tires.\n\nNew tires: 180 per tire, last four years. So per year: 180/4=45.\n\nRepair: 40 per tire, adds one year. So if you repair once, the tire lasts five years. So the cost per tire is 180 (if you buy new) or 40 (if you repair). Wait, but the problem says the customer can choose to buy new or repair. So perhaps the repair is an alternative to buying new.\n\nWait, perhaps the scenario is that the customer's current tires are about to wear out, so they can either buy new tires (180 each, four years) or repair the current ones (40 each, adding one year).\n\nSo for the customer, if they repair, they'll have tires that last one more year (so one year from now). Then, after that, they can repair again, adding another year, and so on.\n\nBut for a four-year period, how much would that cost?\n\nIf they repair once, they have one more year, so total two years. Then, they need to repair again, adding another year, making three years. Then repair again, making four years.\n\nSo for four years, they need three repairs. Each repair is four tires *40=160. So three repairs: 480.\n\nSo for four years, the cost is 480, average per year: 120.\n\nNew tires: 720, average 180.\n\nSo the increase is (180-120)/120=0.5=50%, which again isn't an option.\n\nI'm clearly missing something here. Let me try to read the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"when purchased new, last for four years. A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\"\n\nAh! Oh, wait a second. Perhaps the repair is done once, and the current tires last one additional year beyond their original lifespan. So if the current tires are, say, three years old and have one year left, repairing them makes them last two more years (total four years from now). So the repair cost is 40 per tire, so 160 for four tires.\n\nSo for four years, the cost is 160. So average per year:40.\n\nNew tires: 720/4=180.\n\nSo the average cost per year for new is 180, for repair it's 40.\n\nSo the increase is (180-40)/40=3.5=350%, which isn't an option. So perhaps this isn't the right way to model it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the current tires are already four years old and about to wear out. So without repair, they have zero years left. Repairing them makes them last one additional year. So for four tires, that's 160, and they last one year. So the average cost per year is 160/1=160.\n\nBut that's way higher than new tires' average of 180. So the new tires would be cheaper, which contradicts the question.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to calculate the average cost per year for each option, but perhaps I'm not considering the correct scenario.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the cost per tire per year, not for all four tires. Let's see.\n\nNew tires: 180 per tire, lasts four years. So per year per tire: 45.\n\nRepair: 40 per tire, adds one year. So if you repair once, the tire lasts five years. So per year: (180 +40)/5=220/5=44.\n\nWait, but that's if you're comparing buying new versus repairing once. So the new tire's cost per year is 45, repair is 44. So new is 1 more, which is 2.27% higher, which isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is an alternative to buying new. So the customer has old tires that they can repair once for 40 each, making them last one more year. So for one more year, they pay 160. So the average cost per year for that one year is 160.\n\nBut then, perhaps they would need to buy new tires after that, which would cost 720 for four years. So the total for five years would be 160 +720=880. Average per year:880/5=176.\n\nBut that's not directly comparing to new tires.\n\nI'm clearly not getting this right. Let me try to think differently.\n\nThe question is asking for the average cost per year of the new tires compared to the repair option. So perhaps the average cost for new tires is 180, and for the repair option, it's 40.\n\nSo the percentage increase is (180-40)/40=350%. But that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the average cost per year for the repair option is not 40. Maybe it's 40 per tire per year. So four tires would be 160 per year. Wait, that's not right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair cost is 40 per tire, and the tires last one more year. So the average cost per tire per year is 40/1=40. New tires are 180/4=45. So new is 45, repair is 40.\n\nSo the percentage increase is (45-40)/40=12.5%, which is option C.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because 45 is 12.5% higher than 40. Because 40 *1.125=45.\n\nSo the answer would be 12.5%, option C.\n\n\nThe problem involves comparing the average cost per year of purchasing new tires versus repairing current tires. Here's the analysis:\n\n1. **New Tires Option**:  \n   - Cost per tire: $180.  \n   - Lifespan: 4 years.  \n   - Total cost for four tires: $180 \u00d7 4 = $720.  \n   - Average cost per year: $720 \u00f7 4 = **$180**.\n\n2. **Repair Option**:  \n   - Repair cost per tire: $40.  \n   - Repair extends the lifespan of the current tires by one additional year.  \n   - Assuming the customer needs tires for four years, the repair cost for four tires is: $40 \u00d7 4 = **$160**.  \n   - Average cost per year: $160 \u00f7 4 = **$40**.\n\n3. **Percentage Increase Calculation**:  \n   - The average cost per year for new tires ($180) is compared to the average cost per year for the repair option ($40).  \n   - The formula for percentage increase is:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\frac{\\text{Higher Value} - \\text{Lower Value}}{\\text{Lower Value}} \\times 100\\%\n     \\]  \n   - Substituting the values:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\frac{180 - 40}{40} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{140}{40} \\times 100\\% = 3.5 \\times 100\\% = 350\\%\n     \\]  \n   - However, this result does not match any of the provided options. Re-evaluating the repair option, if the repair cost per tire is $40 and the tires last one additional year, the average cost per year per tire is:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Average cost per year per tire for repair} = \\frac{40}{1} = \\$40\n     \\]  \n   - For new tires, the average cost per year per tire is:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Average cost per year per tire for new tires} = \\frac{180}{4} = \\$45\n     \\]  \n   - The percentage increase in cost per year per tire is:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\frac{45 - 40}{40} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{5}{40} \\times 100\\% = 12.5\\%\n     \\]  \n\nThus, the average cost per year of new tires is **12.5% greater** than the cost of repairing the current tires.\n\nAnswer: C",
