      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a rectangular piece of land. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says the area is 150 square meters. The length is 1 meter more than four times the breadth. I need to find the perimeter. Hmm.\n\nAlright, let me think. I remember that for a rectangle, the area is length multiplied by breadth. And the perimeter is 2 times (length plus breadth). So maybe I can set up some equations here.\n\nLet me denote the breadth as 'b' meters. Then, according to the problem, the length 'l' would be 4 times the breadth plus 1 meter. So, l = 4b + 1.\n\nThe area is l * b = 150. Substituting the expression for l, that becomes (4b + 1) * b = 150. Expanding that, it's 4b\u00b2 + b = 150. So, 4b\u00b2 + b - 150 = 0. That's a quadratic equation in terms of b.\n\nWait, how do I solve this quadratic? The standard form is ax\u00b2 + bx + c =0. So here, a is 4, b is 1, and c is -150. Wait, no, wait. Let me get that right. The equation is 4b\u00b2 + b - 150 = 0. So a=4, b=1, c=-150.\n\nI can use the quadratic formula: b = [-B \u00b1 sqrt(B\u00b2 -4AC)]/(2A). Plugging in the values, it's [-1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 + 2400)]/(8). Because 4*4*150 is 2400, right? Wait, no, 4*A*C would be 4*4* (-150) is -2400. But since it's B squared minus 4AC, it's 1 - (4*4*(-150)). Wait, let me calculate that again.\n\nWait, the discriminant is B\u00b2 - 4AC. So B is 1, so 1^2 is 1. 4*A*C is 4*4*(-150) = 16*(-150) = -2400. So 1 - (-2400) is 1 + 2400 = 2401. Oh, that's a perfect square because 49*49 is 2401. So sqrt(2401) is 49.\n\nSo the solutions are [-1 \u00b149]/(8). Let's compute both possibilities.\n\nFirst solution: (-1 +49)/8 = 48/8 =6. Second solution: (-1-49)/8 = -50/8 = -6.25. Since breadth can't be negative, we take the positive solution, which is 6 meters. So the breadth is 6 meters.\n\nThen, the length l is 4*6 +1 =24 +1=25 meters. So l is 25 m, b is 6 m.\n\nNow, the perimeter is 2*(l + b) = 2*(25+6) = 2*31=62 meters. Wait, but let me double-check the area. 25 *6 is 150. Yep, that matches.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 62. So the answer should be C.\n",

Let me write that out: 4b\u00b2 + b = 150. Oh wait, that's a quadratic equation. Let me rearrange it: 4b\u00b2 + b - 150 = 0.\n\nI need to solve this quadratic for b. Quadratic equations are ax\u00b2 + bx + c =0, so here a=4, b=1, c=-150. Wait, no, that's confusing because the variable is also 'b' for breadth. Let me adjust the variables to avoid confusion. Let me call the breadth 'x'. So the equation becomes 4x\u00b2 + x -150 =0.\n\nNow, I can use the quadratic formula: x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a). Here, a=4, b=1, c=-150.

So b is 1, so 1 squared is 1. 4ac is 4*4*(-150) = 16 * (-150) = -2400? Wait no, wait a is 4, c is -150. So 4ac is 4*4*(-150) = 16 * (-150) = -2400.
