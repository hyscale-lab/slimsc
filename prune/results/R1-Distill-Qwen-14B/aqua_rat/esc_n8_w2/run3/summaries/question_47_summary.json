      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about two cars starting from opposite ends of a 50-mile highway. One is going 12 mph, the other 13 mph. I need to find out how long it takes for them to meet. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.\n\nWait, so they're moving towards each other, right? So their speeds add up because they're approaching each other. Oh, right! Like when two objects move towards each other, the relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. So that would make sense here.\n\nSo the combined speed would be 12 mph plus 13 mph. Let me add those up. 12 +13 is 25 mph. Oh yeah, that's right. So together, they're closing the distance between them at 25 miles per hour.\n\nNow, the total distance between them initially is 50 miles. So I guess I can use the formula: time = distance divided by speed. So time equals 50 miles divided by 25 mph. Let me do that calculation. 50 divided by 25 is 2. Oh wait, that would give me 2 hours. But wait, the options don't have 2 as the first choice, but looking back, option E is 2. So is that the answer?\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my reasoning. Because sometimes when I'm in a hurry, I might mix up the formulas. So the formula for time when two objects are moving towards each other is indeed the total distance divided by the sum of their speeds. So yes, 50/(12+13) is 50/25=2. So the time is 2 hours.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, E is 2. So that would be the correct answer. Hmm, but why am I getting a little confused? Maybe because the options include other numbers, but I think I did it right.\n\nWait another thought: maybe I made a mistake in adding 12 and 13. Let me check. 12 plus 13 is definitely 25. So 50 divided by 25 is 2. So yeah, 2 hours.\n\nSo the answer must be E) 2.\n",
