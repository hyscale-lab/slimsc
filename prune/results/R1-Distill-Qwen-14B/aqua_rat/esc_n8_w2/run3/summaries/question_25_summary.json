      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Bill and his bicycle. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about how far Bill can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes. \n\nAlright, let's read the problem again carefully. Bill usually averages about 15 mph on a normal day. But on a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. So, first, I need to calculate his speed on a windy day. That should be straightforward subtraction.\n\nSo, 15 mph minus 4 mph equals 11 mph. Got it. So Bill's speed on a windy day is 11 mph.\n\nNow, the next part is figuring out how far he can travel in 21 minutes at that speed. Oh wait, speed is in miles per hour, but the time given is in minutes. I remember that I need to convert the time into hours to make the units match. Right, because miles per hour multiplied by hours gives miles.\n\nSo, 21 minutes. How do I convert that to hours? Well, there are 60 minutes in an hour, so I can divide 21 by 60. Let me do that calculation. 21 divided by 60 equals... let's see, 21 \u00f7 60 is 0.35 hours. Because 0.35 multiplied by 60 is 21. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nNow, distance is equal to speed multiplied by time. So I'll multiply Bill's reduced speed by the time in hours. His speed is 11 mph, and the time is 0.35 hours. So 11 times 0.35. Let me calculate that. \n\nHmm, 11 * 0.35. Well, 10 * 0.35 is 3.5, and 1 * 0.35 is 0.35. Adding them together, 3.5 + 0.35 equals 3.85 miles. \n\nWait, but the question says to round to the nearest hundredth. Let me check. 3.85 is already to the hundredth place, so I don't think any rounding is needed here. \n\nLooking at the options, option E is 2.85 miles, D is 3.85 miles. So the correct answer must be D. \n\nBut wait, did I do all the steps right? Let me double-check. \n\nSpeed on a windy day: 15 -4 =11 mph. Time: 21 minutes is 21/60=0.35 hours. Distance: 11 * 0.35 = 3.85 miles. Yep, that's correct. So the answer should be D.\n",

Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says that on a normal day, Bill averages about 15 mph when he's riding his bike. But on a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. The question is asking how far he can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes. And they want the answer rounded to the nearest hundredth. The options are A through E, with E being 2.85 miles.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out Bill's speed on a windy day. Oh right, his speed decreases by 4 mph, so I subtract 4 from 15. Let me do that: 15 minus 4 is 11 mph. So on a windy day, he's going at 11 mph.\n\nNow, the next part is about time. He's riding for 21 minutes. Wait, but speed is in hours, right? Because mph stands for miles per hour. So I need to convert minutes into hours to make the units match.\n\n21 minutes is what fraction of an hour? Well, 60 minutes make an hour. So 21 divided by 60. Let me calculate that. 21 divided by 60 equals... 0.35 hours. Because 60 times 0.35 is 21. So 21 minutes is 0.35 hours.\n\nNow, distance equals speed multiplied by time. So I can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nPlugging in the numbers, his speed is 11 mph, time is 0.35 hours. So 11 multiplied by 0.35. Let me do that math.\n\n11 times 0.35.

So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait a second, did I do that right? Let me double-check. The speed on a windy day is 15 minus 4, which is 11. Time is 21 minutes, which is 0.35 hours. 11 * 0.35: 11 * 0.3 is 3.3, and 11 * 0.05 is 0.55. 3.3 + 0.55 is indeed 3.85. Yep, that seems right.\n\nSo the answer should be D)3.85 miles.\n",
