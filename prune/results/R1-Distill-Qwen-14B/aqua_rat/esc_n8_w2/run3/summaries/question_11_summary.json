      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a company that produces computer components. Let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nThe company makes 420 units every month. Hmm, so per year that would be 420 multiplied by 12 months, right? Let me calculate that: 420 *12. Let's see, 400*12 is 4800, and 20*12 is 240, so together that's 5040 units a year. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nEach component costs them $110 to produce. So the total production cost each month is 420 * 110. Wait, let me do that math. 420 * 100 is 42,000, and 420*10 is 4,200. So 42,000 + 4,200 equals $46,200 per month. So for a year, that would be 46,200 * 12. Let me calculate that. 46,200 *10 is 462,000. 46,200 *2 is 92,400. So adding those together, 462k +92.4k is 554,400. So the yearly production cost is $554,400.\n\nThe company sells all of them every month. The question is about the minimum selling price per component that ensures the yearly profit is at least $626,400. Profit is revenue minus costs. So we need to find the price where (revenue - costs) >= 626,400.\n\nLet me think. The revenue per year is the selling price per unit multiplied by the number of units sold. So revenue = price * 5040 units. And the cost is 554,400. So profit = revenue - cost = (price *5040) -554400.\n\nWe need this profit to be at least 626,400. So:\n\n(price *5040) -554400 >= 626400\n\nLet me rearrange this equation. Adding 554400 to both sides:\n\nprice *5040 >= 626400 +554400\n\nCalculating the right side: 626400 +554400. Let's add them. 600,000 +554,400 is 1,154,400, plus 26,400 is 1,180,800. So:\n\nprice *5040 >= 1,180,800\n\nNow, solve for price: price >= 1,180,800 /5040.\n\nLet me compute that division. Hmm, 5040 times 200 is 1,008,000. Because 5040*200 is 5040*2*100=10,080*100=1,008,000. \n\nSubtracting that from 1,180,800: 1,180,800 -1,008,000 = 172,800.\n\nNow, 5040 goes into 172,800 how many times? Let's see, 5040*30 is 151,200. 172,800 -151,200 =21,600. \n\n5040*4 is 20,160. So that's 34 in total (30+4) and 21,600-20,160=1,440 left. \n\n5040 *0.2857 is about 1,440 because 5040 *0.3 is 1512, which is a bit more. Let me see, 5040 *0.2857: 5040 *0.2857 \u2248 1440. So total is 34.2857.\n\nSo 200 +34.2857 =234.2857. So the price per unit needs to be at least approximately $234.29.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 234. Let me check the options again: A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nSo 234.29 is between 230 and 240. The next higher option is 240. So the minimum price would be $240, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I miscalculated the total cost or revenue.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me calculate 1,180,800 divided by 5040. \n\nLet me see, 5040 * 200 is 1,008,000 as before. 1,180,800 minus 1,008,000 is 172,800. \n\nDividing 172,800 by 5040:\n\n5040 * 34 is 5040 *30=151,200, plus 5040*4=20,160. So 151,200 +20,160=171,360. \n\n172,800 -171,360=1,440. \n\nNow, 5040 * 0.2857 is approximately 1,440. So 34.2857. So 200 +34.2857=234.2857.\n\nSo about $234.29. But since we can't have a fraction of a dollar in price, the price has to be at least $235. But the options don't have that. So the next higher option is C)240. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute 5040 *234.2857:\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to compute 1,180,800 /5040.\n\nLet me try 1,180,800 \u00f75040.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: 118,080 \u00f7504.\n\nHmm, 504 *234 = let's compute 504*200=100,800; 504*34=504*(30+4)=15,120+2,016=17,136. So 100,800 +17,136=117,936. \n\n118,080 -117,936=144.\n\nSo 504 *234=117,936. Then 144 left. 144/504=0.2857.\n\nSo 234.2857. So same as before.\n\nSo the exact minimum price is $234.2857 per unit. But since the options are all integers, and the price must be at least that, the next higher integer is 235. But that's not an option. The next higher option is 240, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let's check if 235 would be sufficient. Let me see: 235 *5040 = ?\n\n235 *5040 = (200 +35) *5040 = 200*5040=1,008,000 and 35*5040=176,400. So total is 1,008,000 +176,400=1,184,400.\n\nProfit would be 1,184,400 -554,400=630,000. Which is more than 626,400. So 235 is sufficient. But the options don't have 235. So the next available option is 240. \n\nBut wait, maybe I should check what the profit would be at 230 and 240 to see which is the first that meets or exceeds 626,400.\n\nAt 230 per unit: \n\nRevenue =230 *5040 = let's compute 230 *5000=1,150,000. 230*40=9,200. So 1,150,000+9,200=1,159,200.\n\nProfit =1,159,200 -554,400 =604,800. Which is less than 626,400. So 230 isn't enough.\n\nAt 240:\n\nRevenue=240*5040. 240 *5000=1,200,000. 240*40=9,600. So total 1,209,600.\n\nProfit=1,209,600 -554,400=655,200. Which is more than 626,400.\n\nSo the minimum price is between 230 and 240. Since 235 gives 630,000, which is enough, but since 235 isn't an option, the next higher is 240. So the correct answer must be option C, 240.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out the minimum selling price per component that the company should set to make a yearly profit of at least $626,400. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the given data. The company produces 420 units every month. So, over a year, how many units are we talking about? Well, a year has 12 months, right? So 420 times 12. Let me calculate that. 420 * 12 is 5040 units per year. Okay, so they produce 5040 components each year.\n\nThe production cost per component is $110. So, the total production cost for the year would be the number of units produced multiplied by the cost per unit. That would be 5040 * 110. Let me compute that. Hmm, 5040 * 100 is 504,000, and 5040 * 10 is 50,400. So adding those together gives 554,400. So their total production cost for the year is $554,400.\n\nNow, the company wants a yearly profit of at least $626,400. Profit is calculated as revenue minus costs. So, the required revenue (the total money they make from sales) must cover both the production costs and the desired profit. So, the revenue needs to be production cost plus profit. Let me write that down: Revenue = Total Cost + Profit.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: Revenue = $554,400 + $626,400. Let me add those two. 554,400 plus 626,400. 554k plus 626k is 1,180,800, right? So, Revenue must be at least $1,180,800 per year.\n\nWait, but revenue is also the selling price per unit multiplied by the number of units sold. Since they sell all of them each month, the number of units sold per year is 5040. So, Revenue = Selling Price * 5040. Let me denote the selling price as 'p'. So, p * 5040 >= 1,180,800.\n\nTo find the minimum 'p', I need to solve for p. So, p >= 1,180,800 / 5040. Let me compute that division.\n\nHmm, 5040 into 1,180,800. Let's see, 5040 times 200 is 1,008,000. Subtract that from 1,180,800 and we get 172,800 left. Now, 5040 times 34 is let's see, 5040*30 is 151,200, 5040*4 is 20,160. So 151,200 + 20,160 = 171,360. That's less than 172,800. The difference is 172,800 - 171,360 = 1,440. So, 5040 * 0.2857 is about 1,440 (since 5040 * 0.2857 is 5040*(2/7) which is 1440). So adding that to 34 gives 34.2857. So the total would be 200 + 34.2857 = 234.2857.\n\nWait, that's approximately 234.29. But since the selling price has to be at least this amount, the minimum price is 234.29. But looking at the options, the closest higher option is 230 or 240. Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to compute 1,180,800 divided by 5040. Let me do that step by step. Let me write it as 1,180,800 \u00f7 5040.\n\nFirst, both numbers can be divided by 10 to make it 118,080 \u00f7 504. Let me see if 504 divides into 118080 easily.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can simplify the fraction. Let's see, 5040 is 504 * 10, so 5040 = 504 * 10. So, 1,180,800 / 5040 = (1,180,800 \u00f7 10) / 504 = 118,080 / 504.\n\nNow, let's divide 118,080 by 504. Let me see how many times 504 goes into 118,080.\n\n504 * 200 = 100,800. Subtracting that from 118,080 leaves 17,280.\n\n504 * 34 is 17,136. Because 504 * 30 is 15,120, and 504*4 is 2,016. Adding those gives 17,136. Subtracting from 17,280 leaves 144.\n\nSo 504 goes into 144 144/504 times, which simplifies to 0.2857 times.\n\nSo, adding up: 200 + 34 = 234, plus 144/504 is 234.2857... So approximately 234.2857.\n\nBut the options are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nHmm, 234.2857 is not an option. Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me recalculate the required revenue.\n\nThe company's yearly profit needs to be at least $626,400. Profit is revenue minus production cost. So,\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost.\n\nWe need Profit >= 626,400.\n\nSo, Revenue >= Cost + Profit.\n\nCost is 554,400, Profit is 626,400. So, Revenue >= 554,400 + 626,400 = 1,180,800. That's correct.\n\nSo Revenue must be at least 1,180,800. Revenue is selling price per unit multiplied by the number of units sold. Units sold per year: 420/month *12 = 5040.\n\nSo, p = Revenue / 5040 >= 1,180,800 /5040.\n\nWait, 5040 is 504 * 10, so 1,180,800 /5040 = (1,180,800 \u00f7 10) /504 = 118,080 /504.\n\nLet me compute 118,080 \u00f7 504.\n\nHmm, 504 * 234 = ?\n\nWait, 504 * 200 = 100,800.\n\n504 * 30 = 15,120 \u2192 200+30=230 \u2192 100,800 +15,120 = 115,920.\n\n504 *4 = 2,016 \u2192 230+4=234 \u2192 115,920 +2,016= 117,936.\n\nBut 118,080 -117,936=144.\n\nSo 118,080 /504 = 234 + (144/504) \u2192 234 + 0.2857=234.2857.\n\nSo p must be at least approximately $234.29 per component.\n\nLooking at the options, the choices are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nSo 234.29 is higher than 230, so the next higher option is C)240. So the minimum price is $240. But wait, wait\u2014could I have miscalculated something?\n\nWait, let me think again. Another approach: Let me compute 5040 * 230. 5040 *200=1,008,000. 5040*30=151,200. So 1,008,000 +151,200=1,159,200. The required revenue is 1,180,800. So 1,159,200 is less than 1,180,800. So 230 won't be enough because 5040*230=1,159,200 <1,180,800. So the price needs to be higher than 230.\n\nSimilarly, 5040 *240 = 5040*(200+40) = 1,008,000 + 201,600=1,209,600. Which is higher than 1,180,800. So 240 would give a revenue of 1,209,600, which would give a profit of 1,209,600 -554,400=655,200, which is higher than 626,400. So 240 is sufficient.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the exact minimum is between 230 and 240, but the options don't have a 234. So the next higher option is 240, which is option C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the minimum price, so perhaps I should take the ceiling of 234.29, which is 235. But since the options don't have that, the next higher option is 240.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again: B is 230, C is 240. So 230 is not enough because 5040*230=1,159,200, which gives a profit of 1,159,200 -554,400=604,800. Which is less than 626,400. So 230 is insufficient.\n\nSo the minimum price is 234.29, but since the options don't have that, the next available is 240. So the correct answer is C)240.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out the minimum selling price per component that the company should set to make a yearly profit of at least $626,400. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the given data. The company produces 420 units every month. So, over a year, how many units are we talking about? Well, a year has 12 months, right? So 420 times 12. Let me calculate that. 420 * 12 is 5040 units per year. Okay, so they produce 5040 components each year.\n\nThe production cost per component is $110. So, the total production cost for the year would be the number of units produced multiplied by the cost per unit. That would be 5040 * 110. Let me compute that. Hmm, 5040 * 100 is 504,000, and 5040 * 10 is 50,400. So adding those together gives 554,400. So their total production cost for the year is $554,400.\n\nNow, the company wants a yearly profit of at least $626,400. Profit is calculated as revenue minus costs. So, the required revenue (the total money they make from sales) must cover both the production costs and the desired profit. So, the revenue needs to be production cost plus profit. Let me write that down: Revenue = Total Cost + Profit.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: Revenue = $554,400 + $626,400. Let me add those two. 554,400 plus 626,400. 554k plus 626k is 1,180,800, right? So, Revenue must be at least $1,180,800 per year.\n\nWait, but revenue is also the selling price per unit multiplied by the number of units sold. Since they sell all of them each month, the number of units sold per year is 5040. So, Revenue = Selling Price * 5040. Let me denote the selling price as 'p'. So, p * 5040 >= 1,180,800.\n\nTo find the minimum 'p', I need to solve for p. So, p >= 1,180,800 / 5040. Let me compute that division.\n\nHmm, 5040 into 1,180,800. Let's see, 5040 times 200 is 1,008,000. Subtract that from 1,180,800 and we get 172,800 left. Now, 5040 times 34 is let's see, 5040*30 is 151,200, 5040*4 is 20,160. So 151,200 + 20,160 = 171,360. That's less than 172,800. The difference is 172,800 - 171,360 = 1,440. So, 5040 * 0.2857 is about 1,440 (since 5040 * 0.2857 is 5040*(2/7) which is 1440). So adding that to 34 gives 34.2857. So the total would be 200 + 34.2857 = 234.2857.\n\nWait, that's approximately 234.29. But since the selling price has to be at least this amount, the minimum price is 234.29. But looking at the options, the closest higher option is 230 or 240. Wait, wait, wait.

So, 1,180,800 / 5040 = (1,180,800 \u00f7 10) / 504 = 118,080 / 504.\n\nNow, let's divide 118,080 by 504. Let me see how many times 504 goes into 118,080.\n\n504 * 200 = 100,800. Subtracting that from 118,080 leaves 17,280.\n\n504 * 34 is 17,136. Because 504 * 30 is 15,120, and 504*4 is 2,016. Adding those gives 17,136. Subtracting from 17,280 leaves 144.\n\nSo 504 goes into 144 144/504 times, which simplifies to 0.2857 times.\n\nSo, adding up: 200 + 34 = 234, plus 144/504 is 234.2857...
