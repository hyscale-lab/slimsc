      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a telephone bill, and I need to figure out what the bill would be for a month where 500 calls were made. Hmm. Let's see. The problem says the bill is partly fixed and partly varies with the number of calls. Oh right, that means the bill has a fixed cost plus a variable cost based on the number of calls.\n\nSo, in the first month, they made 540 calls, and the bill was Rs.1800. Another month, 620 calls cost Rs.2040. I need to find out what the fixed and variable parts are, then apply them to 500 calls.\n\nWait, I think I can set up equations for this. Let me denote the fixed cost as F and the variable cost per call as V. Then, the total bill would be F + (number of calls)*V.\n\nSo for the first scenario:\n540 calls = 540 * V\nTotal bill = F + 540V = 1800. Equation 1: F + 540V = 1800.\n\nSecond scenario:\n620 calls = 620 * V\nTotal bill = F + 620V = 2040. Equation 2: F + 620V = 2040.\n\nNow I have two equations with two variables. I can subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate F.\n\nEquation 2 minus Equation 1:\n(F + 620V) - (F + 540V) = 2040 - 1800\nF cancels out, so 620V -540V = 240.\nThat's 80V = 240. So V = 240 /80 = 3.\n\nOh, so the variable cost per call is Rs.3. Now I can plug this back into one of the equations to find F.\n\nUsing equation 1: F + 540*3 = 1800.\n540 *3 is 1620. So F + 1620 =1800. F=1800-1620=180.\n\nSo the fixed cost is Rs.180, and variable is Rs.3 per call.\n\nNow, for the third month, they made 500 calls. So the bill would be F + 500V.\n\nCalculating that: 180 + 500*3 = 180 + 1500 = 1680.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is Rs.1680. So that should be the answer.\n",
